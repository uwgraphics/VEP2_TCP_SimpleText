SONGS OF SION.

Set for the joy of gods dear ones, who sit here by the brooks of this
worlds Babel, and weep when they think on Jerusalem which is on high.

By W. L.

Let the word of god dvvell in you plenteouslie in all vvisdome teaching, and
admonishing your own selves in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual songs,
singing with a grace in your hearts to the lord. Colos. 3. 16. To all such of
the Congregation both men, women, and children o^ discretion that are of the
English nation* residing at Hamborough that seek, and serve god in sincerity
without hypocrisy or faction.
Grace be given in Christ BLessed, and beloved in the lord. The Christian
sobriety* and comfortable charity which I observed in my table brothers
occasioned the co^posing of these hymns. It was their goodness to make them
public for the benefitt of others also. They are all divine songs, yea from
meditations of the scripture are they drawn. If you shall use them in your
private families to gods glory, ^ur own solace, and to the instruction,
^edification of your children I have ^e end of my desire. Receive them as ^e
symptoms of my souls affection the general aduancment of gods ^uice, to the
private consolation of you your children, and to the praise, and ^nour of our
own mother tongue. ^us in the midest of many harshe ^mes of grudge, and
despite I have ^arned to tune the songs of Sion. For which I praise god, and
shall never ^ase to pray for your blessedness in the ^uing mercies of Jesus
Christ his ^uours. resting

Yours in the lord W. L.

An hymn or song.

Of seven strains, or strings ^et to the tone of seven sobs, and sighs of a
seven times seven s^d soul for sin, and is to be song i^ the tune of

I life mine heart to thee. PSALM 25 or. Fly soul unto thy rest. Seven times a
day will I pray to thee o god, and will praise thee o lord for thy great
gifts, and good graces, both to me, and mine PSALM CXIX. When the spright of
man does sighe and sob to god, and is lift up on high, the spright of god does
bow it self to man in joy, and peace.

CYPRIAN.

To his much esteemed good friend Mr. ^OHN POWELL one of ^he assistants of the
worthy company of the Merchants Adventurers residing at Hamborough.
Grace, peace, and mercy be multiplied in Christ Jesus. WOrthy friend. When
Iulia^ the Apostate infested the church of god, so^times by barbarous cruelty,
and sometimes by deuilish policy, among other his wicked practices that was
not the least, nor the last when ^e interdited the christians all use of
books, both privately, and publike^ for their children to learn except
Poetry. It pleased almighty god in that distress of his church to stir up a
learned man one Apollinarius a singular Metaphrast to put into heroical Greek
verse all the psalms of David by which blessing the children of god had use,
and comfort of that excel lent book of the psalm, and the tyrants decree
took noe hold of the^, because now it was become divine poesy, and poetry
they might read. Which shows unto us gods especial, and singular providence
for his church upon all occasions. And now albeit (god be blessed) there is
noe cause to complain either of any such Apostatical power, for we have an
Apostolical king, nor of any such wicked policy, for we have had kings, and
Quee^s nursing fathers, and nursing mothers of our church; yet in these Hal^yon
days of ours I have presumed to metaphrase some passages of David psalms as
an Essay to know whether we might express our hearts to god in our holy
soliloquies by mo^asillables in our own mother tongue, or no. It being a
received opinion amongst many of those who seem rather to be iuditious, then
caprichious, that heretofore our english tongue in the true idiome thereof
consisted altogether of Monasillables, until it came to be blended, and
mingled with the commixture of Exotique languages. And I my self have seen
all the lord prayer used in the time of John Wickleefe to be expressed in
words of one syllable. And because gods children did reckon seven times
seven years before they could enjoy their year of Iubile. I have made
allusion in this little Essay to tune forth seaue^ times seven sad sobbs for
sin, that when we have spent the remaynder of our vvretched days of our
pilgrimage here, god may in his mercy wipe away all tears from our eyes,
and bring us to our eternal Iubile in his glorious kingdom. Which god grant
to you, to me, and to all Christian people for his own rich mercy sake, and
the satisfactory meritts of Jesus Christ our lord Amen.

When thou shall think, and thank him still
For health, and peace to thee.

A space, and then does slack
But in his face, and grace for aye,
Thou can not joy long lack.
5.
Though gripes, and greefes full sor^
Do lodge with thee all night
Yet joy, and grace shall be at hand
Ere that the day be light.
6.
The lord is kind, and meek
When we do make him grieve,
He is full slovve his wrath to show,
Great grace he does us give.

And lo what love good men
To their own seed do bear,
Like grace the lord does shevve to such
As searue him in his fear.

PSALM XXXIX. death I will be thy death (says ^rist) for he is the death of
death, the ^eath of sin, the life of man, and the breath of god for man to
live there in world with out end. HAMBOROUGH Januarij 24. 1620.

To his much respected good friend Mr. THOMAS BARKER one of ^e assistants of the
worthy company ^f the Merchants Adventurers residing at Hamborough.
The blessing of both worlds in ^rist Jesus. Well-beloved. There is nothing more
comfortable to a spiritual minded man ^n to muse, and meditate of his ^arture
hence into the blessed ^t of Christ in the other life: ^ to a vvordling that
would ^ld up a rest for his body here, and ^g a requiem to his soul in this
^le of tears nothing is more fearful, and hiddeous then for hi^ to hear
death spoken of. We m^ therefore examine our selves whether we can sing a
song of^ in this exile, and banishment, vvhther we can solace our selves, in
hymns, and songs of our ends, a^ departure hence. For we m^ hence Nothing
more sure, but t^ time when, the place where, (...) the manner how Nothing
more unsure. It is sufficient that g^ tells us our life is but a flov^ that
fades, an hour the passes a shadovve that depart^ a vanity that vexes, a
moment t^ vvarneth, a nothing when vv^ have done all we can. For ^ thoughts,
our faults, our purpos^ our proiects, our loves, our liu^ when our breath
departet^ perishes in the tvvinckling of O then let us meditate, and muse our
selves, and sing, and say to our ^les, that our end, and the last ^ings are not
the least, but the best ^ngs that we can consider of to ^rtifie us, and make
us meet for ^e saving mercies of god in Christ, which I recomend you in my
^arest love, and rest.

Yours in life, and death. W. LO.

The first muse.
1.
^Eare soul thou have thought of thy end
And now muse on the way,
^he first part is a life well spent,
The last is deaths doomes day.
2.
^all I call that the way of vvoe
By which we pass to bliss?
sure there is noe way but that
To bring me where Christ is.
3.
and what is death now do thou think?
But down with all the sticks,
^f which this earth, and tent of ours
Is made, that against god kickes.
4.
^eath is the farevvell of old friends,
Till they meet to be blessed,
^eath is the judge to quitt from iayle,
The soul that longs for rest.
5.
Death makes the corpse of cla^ (...) slee^
But vvakes the soul to see,
Death pays the debte, and tears the bo^
And all to set thee free.
6.
There is a death of deaths my soul
The death of hell, and vvoe,
But Christ his death has paid for the
His word does tell thee so.
7.
O Christ my soul does think on the
And thanks thee day, and nigh^
That thou have r^d me from this death
By thy great power, and might.

Get home ene to thy rest,

I hold it for the best.
2.
^y soul how can thou fear to go
In stepps where Christ has bine;
^e has to grave led thee the way
O then leave of to sin.
3.
^or hire of sin is death, and grave
To death are deep fell vvayes;
^here needs noe kinues, noe cords, noe svvords,
It comes on nights, and days.
4.
^ne by a slatt, a fly, a grape,
One by a bit of meat
^ne by the air, a flovver, a thorn
Comes to his doom so great.
5.
Why then my soul fear not the dea^
The sting of it is lost
The bed of grave is svveete, and safe
Through Christ his care, and cost.
6.
Our sin made death our foe at last
Our friend Christ has it made;
By death we pass the port of rest
When all things else do fade.
7.
What if this giude do lead my corpse
Through grave both dark and fell ^
Whiles at that time my soul does live
And with my Christ does dvv^ll.

WHat if my friends do mourn for me
And sobb, and sigh in moan;
What if my seed do cry, and roar,
And grieve, and vvaile, and groan?
2.
This while my soul sees him that was
Once dead but now does live,
And that for aye my Christ in god,
My lord that life does give.
3.
What care I who does shutt mine ^ies
When death does make me see
As I am seen of god in Christ
And then with him shall be.
4.
What if my life the world do not
Set out in words, of fame
Whiles I live with the god of life
What care I for the same.
5.
If death shovvld still be foe to me
He harms but my vvorst part,
My best part far out of his reac^
Scorns both his ruth, and dar^.
6.
And more then this my corpse once dea^
Feels noe more sting of death,
But then my soul is free, and lives
In god by Christ his breath.
7.
Now then my soul sich thou do^ bea^
Two things vvrapt up in breast
Let each part turn, and go, and se^
His seat, his site, his rest.

For friends, for foes, for all.

When kings, and Prests, and rich, and poor
And all must thus go hence

^asse on my soul, and sing, and joy
In god that makes the grave,
A place for thee to pass to bliss
And knovves what thou would have.
5.
How often have thou seen eyes f^ clo^
And heard by dint of svvord
How often vain men in field ha^ foug^
In fence of a vain word
6.
What the^ now do thou fear my soul^
The stage of death is bed,
And grave that rests our bones in pea^
That here on earth have fed
7.
Let them fear death whose heart, and mind
Is more sick the^ their face
How can thou fear since now thy Christ
Has shed his blood for grace.

Then live on this ville shore.

And art thou loath to go?
Rouse up thy self for shame o soul
And do not serve him so.

use it as I know you do publicly so I doubt no^ but you use it also
privately Preaching is gods speech to you Prayer is ours to him. Preaching
belongs to me, I preach to you ^ your pastor, and pray for you also Prayer
belongs to you to pray for me, your self, all yours, all go^ children. For the
manner how no^ better president, noe more perfect pattern, then S. Paulls
practice (...) his prayers, which I have here metaphrased for you in the
syllables of your own mother tongue. Go^ the father is the objecte of your
prayers, and praises. God the son the presenter of them as the only master of
requests in heaven. Go^ the holy ghost the very breath (...) your prayers, the
simle of you^ soul. Use this blessed exercise both of prayer, and praise. Be
in love with it, and god will love you. To which love of his in this model
of my best love to you I recomend your well disposed thoughts in the saving
mercies of Christ Jesus your lord, and mine. Resting

My mind would keep thy law, thy lore.
And has thy will still sought

But my base flesh is prompt, and seeks
Thy law to cast me fro.
O god what shall I do in this?
With me the case is so.
4.
My mind would do the god full feign
That thy laws shevve to me
But still my flesh does frett, and fume
Against this thy law to me

For I do not that which I love,
But I do that I hate,
And all for that my mind is vexed
With this my flesh my mate.

What shall I do o lord my god
Ah wretch who setts thee free?
From this fell death of sin, and shame
That I thy grace may see.

PSALM. CXIX. 1. part. To his much esteemed good friend Mr. WILLIAM CHRISTMAS
Merchant one of the deacons of the English Church residing at Hamborough:
Grace here, glory for ever in Christ.

Loving, and beloved friend. The title of this heavenly hymn shows the
excellency thereof. For it is called the song of songs, or the Canticles of
wise Soloman. The subject is most sacred, for it is the ^uptiall love song
betvveene Christ, and his spouse. Wherein their mutual loves by svveete
rese^bla^ces are mystically, and maruelously expressed What more comfortable
song then to sing our hearts love we bear to Christ in the blessed union by
one spirit vvherby we have everlasting life. Two of the first chapters of
which song I have metaphrased into Monosyllables, which I have bequethed to
your love as a sign of mine, and to seal both ours. Receive it as the rest of
your colleagues, for I vvish you all the happiness of both worlds in the saving
mercies of Christ t^ which I recommend you, and a^ that look upon you with
love resting.

Yours because of Christ W. LO.

The first Song.
The spouse speaks to Christ.
1.
O that thou would on me so cast
Some looks of thy svveete love,
That thou may make me dear to thee
My heart with grace to move
2.
Thy love o Christ is far more dear,
And far more sveete to me
Then wealth, or wine, or limb, or life,
Or ought that I can see.
3.
The svveete that I smell of thy name
Is like an oil most pure,
And pourd it is on all thy saints
Such is thy love so sure.
4.
O dravve me, dravve me, I will run
To board, to bed with thee;
O pull me, pull me from my sin
O rid me, set me free.
The spouses speaks.
5.
The good are glad in thee, thy love
They long, and look for still
They walk to thee, they talk of thee
And all to do thy will.
6.
Grant this o Christ, and then we shall
Be all in all that is,
And thou shall find that none of v^
Of thy grace ought to miss.
7.
O shevve me, whom my soul does love*
Where thou do feed at noone.
O why should I thus freet, and feel^
The loss of thee so soon.
The second Song.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
1.
O Thou my church whom I do love
For vvho^ I shed my blood
(...) thou know not what thou do crave,
and have not seen the good
2.
^hen get thee to those flocks of mine
where as they feed by those
Whom I have set as giuds for them
That I in love have chose.
3.
^here feed, and fatt thy self with food,
That Saints do touch, do taste;
And tune their souls in thanks to me
For love that aye does last.
4.
For dear thou art to me my love,
For shape, for strength, for speed:
That none is like to thee my dear
In thought, in word, in deed.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
5.
Those parts of thee where love does look
Are set with pearls of grace
With stones of price, with chains of vvorth,
I love to see thy face.
6.
These signs of love, are seals to thee,
What shall be thine else where
When thou shall shine in bliss with me
O spouse, my love most dear.
7.
There spangs, and specks of gold most pure
I Will add to all the rest.
There shall thou love, and live with me
And eke for aye be blessed.
The third Song.
The spouse speaks to her mates.
1.
SEe now all ye that love the lord
Ye Nymphs, ye Mayds of grace
Whiles that my lord, and king now seems
Far of from me in place
2.
And is in midst of troops of saints
On high where he does dvvell;
Where all do tend on him in love,
Where all things sure goes well.
3.
Yet see his grace does stoop to me,
I feel him with me here,
By power of spright, by gifts of light,
He comes to me most near.
4.
And though I be much joy to him,
Yet he is all to me;
As bunch of myrrh tvvixt both my breasts,
So svveete to heart is he
The spouse to her mates.
5.
Oh is there ought in the wide world
That smells, that smiles as he
Ah svveete, ah svveete my soul does feel
His love a life to me.
6.
His love laid close to my poor heart
To sense gives such a touch.
That for his love to dye, to dye.
I would not think it much.
7.
Watch then, and wait ye maids that mourn
For this my love will come;
And judge he will in truth, and power
The folk both all, and some.
The fourth Song.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
1.
Dear spouse noe love is lost on me
To me thou art most svveete,
To see thee clad in clothes of grace
With rings, and roabs most meet.
2.
^ joy, I like, I love thee dear,
How fair, how fresh art thou?
None like to thee in shine of face,
As I look on thee now.
3.
How chaste, how choice art thou my dear?
Thine eyes like doves do look.
Thine heart, thy mind, thy thoughts, thy all.
I write the^ in my book
The spouse speaks to Christ.
4.
Nay thou my dear thou art the chief
The choice, the sun, the shine.
From thee o Christ I have these rays
For they are none of mine
Christ speaks to his spouse.
5.
Thou art o Christ full of this grace
Thou art the sea the spring;
And from thee I do take these streams
and to thee the^ do bring
6.
As thanks for all thy love to me,
And to thy saints each one;
Who troop in bands to serve thee still,
Though here they weep, and moan.
7.
For they are sure to rest in bliss
When thou shall call them home
From out this sea of sobs, and sighs
That does so frett, and ^ome
The fifth Song.
CAP. 2.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
1.
Dear spouse I am both fair, and svveete
Of field I am the rose,
And sure all such as live by me
Full choice I am to those.
2.
All things else that this world has, be
Vile weeds which are most base
^ am the svveet, the sense, the smell
That yeald them all the grace.
3.
and thou o love art among the maids
All choice, and chief in view
Naught in the earth is like to thee,
In face, in shine, in hue.
The spouse speaks to Christ.
4.
^ thou my dear, that one I love
Thou art the tree of life;
Thy shade let sheeld me from all harms
And I will be thy wife.
The spouse speaks.
5.
Thou with thy spright shall lead me forth
To the svveete streams of good,
And I shall be fresht with thy love
Wrought to me in thy blood.
6.
O stay me, stay me take a care,
O cheer my soul that faints,
O come for I am sick of love
To live in midst of saints.
7.
O put thy left hand to my head
Thy right hand to my side
O stay me up both head, and heart
And still be thou my giude.
The sixth Song.
The spouse speaks.
1.
^ charge ye o you souls of saints,
By roes, and hindes of love,
^ake heed how you doo^vexe, and grieve
The spright of my svveete dove.
2.
^ake heed you vvrong not his great name,
with life so leaud so vain
And do not dare to move his ire
Who would save you so feign.
3.
^oe I do call, and he does hear,
And sends to me his voice;
My mou^ts of sins, and hills of shame
Have not so lovvd a noice.
4.
Noe roe, noe hind so swift ca^ ru^ne
Nor make such speed as he
When I do call, or cr^e for him
He comes, he runs to me.
The spouse speaks.
5.
And though this veil of my baseflesh
A full sight bares me fro,
Yet vvit^ mine eye of ^aith, I look
On him that loves me so.
6.
I see him as in a clear glass,
I see him shine full bright;
Through grates of words, and gates of life
My soul of him has sight.
7.
And now me thinks I hear him* speak
And thus to me does say
O church, o spouse lift up thy head
O fair one come thy way.
The seventh Song.
Christ speaks.
1.
^he storm is past of grief, and woe
The spring of joy is seen
all things now are fresh, and fair
And full, and nevve, and green.
2.
^n high is joy, on earth is peace,
To men a great good will;
^d all the quire of saints do sing
To shevve their love, their skill.
3.
^ot buds, but ^iggs, and fruits are seen
Of grace, of joy, of love;
come my dear, shake of thy sleep
Come on my milk white dove.
4.
^ let me hear thy voice my dear
O plye me with thy plaints,
^ look thou up though face be sad
I Will place thee with my saints.
Christ speaks.
5.
O all ye that vvishe well to me,
And to my church, and name
Put from my dear all those that seek^
Her faith, her love to blame.
The spouse speaks.
6.
For he is mine by faith, and trust,
And I am his by love.
We both are one by his great pow^
I long to see my do^e.
7.
O come as swift as Roe, or Hind
My love, my life to me
Till day do break, till sun do^ shin^
Till shade of death does flee.
A Canticle, or song.

Monosylables of Great Britains language, and is to be used by every devout
soul in his private conference with his god.

And is set to the tune of Help lord for good, and godly men PSALM. XII.

To his much esteemed good friend Mr. ISAAC LEE one of the assistants of the
most worthy company of the marchants-Adventurers residing at Hamb:
Increase of glory. MOre the^ much beloved when god brought man forth at the
first he put him not into a wilderness, but into a garden, a paradise, and
place of pleasure whereby I see that his sacred majesty did not rejoice in the
misery, but in the delight and happiness of his creatures. Cheerefulnes
therefore pleases god better then dulnes, (...) and heaviness of heart. Let us
be* godly, and good in our pleasures, and it will never displease our maker)
neither will he grudge, or repin^ at our joy. To this purpose have I framed
certain hymns for the private solace of such as shall take delight there in.
One portion whereof I have consecrated to you* Let yt have acceptance of you
by your practice of yt* I expect (...) other guerdon for my pains. For the
highest knovves with what an honest heart I composed this, and the rest, and
what a desire I had in the framing thereof for the good of many. I have ever
hated epicurean resolution* Let us eat, and drink to morrovve we shall dye.
But I have ever loved entyre (...) exhortacion. Let (...) us pray, and praise
god, To morrovve we shall live For to love, is to live, and where we love,
the^e we live* If we love god, we shall live in him by our prayers, by our
praises, and all by one spirit. O then let us so love him, that we may live in
him in our daily voices, that they may be hard to his glory, our comfort, and
good example of our brethren. The god of heaven joy your ^art in all your life,
and in your death that we may all meet to sing together in the quire of
heaven with the angels in the saving mercies of our Savior Christ.

Yours much more then mine own. W. LO.

The first speech.
The spouse speaks to Christ.
1.
IN ^ed I sought my love by night,
But could not find him there,
I sought him but he was far off,
And did not come me near.
2.
I rose, and vvalkt the streates to see
If my soul could him find
Whom I did want, yet found I not
The day star of my mind.
3.
The^ ra^ I straight to those that teach
And vvatch, and wait for me
And said to the^ ca^ ye shevve now
Where I my love might see.
4.
And thus half spent with care, and cost,
My soul began faint, and fail
Lo then my love did shevve himself,
and would not let me quail
The spouse speaks to Christ.
5.
So that by a nevve act of faith*
I savve where he was not.
We miss him in our beds of rest
The world is not his lot.
6.
The streets are strayts of cost, and care
Where we do lose him quite,
But in the word, and soul of man
We feel him in his might.
7.
But when I found him hold I took
Fast hold on him I laid,
Noe more to part with him at all
Then he to me thus said.
The second speech.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
1.
Now that my spouse has toyld all night
And lokt, and longd for me.
I charge you all that are my friends,
And look to live in glee.
2.
Stir her not up, nor wake my dear
With toys, or tales of yore
But let her rest in peace, and joy,
And vex her now noe more.
3.
Oh who is this that comes so fair
From out the foul worlds lane,
And has shakt of her slough of sin
That would have been her bane
4.
It is my Church, my chair of state
Where I do love to be
It is my dove my stay my dear
It glads me her to see.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
5.
That is so quitt from world of wo^
From sink of sin, and shame*
She seeks to me for all her wants
She trusts to my great name,
6.
She smells as myrrh, and spice of cost
Gracd with my chains of love,
She is my spouse* no spott she has,
She is my milk whit dove.
7.
All fair, and full of grace most bright
She comes, she ru^ns to me
Come on my dear, make thou noe stay
Thy love, thy life to see.
The third speech.
The spouse speaks.
1.
O now my soul thou have a glymse
Of joy that is on high,
O blessed are they that view it all,
Or do that place come nighe.
2.
The courts on earth of kings most great
Are rich, and rare to view,
But this where my Christ rules, and reigns
For aye is fair, and nevve,
3.
The guard of this great court of state
Are Saints, and sprights of might
That do his will at all his beckes,
And dvvell with him in light.
4.
The courts of kings are made with hands
Their care, their cost is vain,
But here is a Court not made by me^
Where my svveet Christ do reign.
The spouses speaks.
5.
He in him self is all the state,
He gives his court the grace,
He is the light, the hight, the all,
That is still in that place
6.
Come forth ye Saints of god in* Christ,
and see this court of rays
O take a view of this your life
O seek it all your days.
7.
Christ is your Bride groom, and you are
To him a spouse most bright.
He has you bought with blood most decre
And gaynd you with his might.
The fourth speech.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
1.
How fair art thou my dear, my spouse
With out, and eke with in.
How void of filth, or spotts of shame
Of sink, or stinch of sin.
2.
For I do purge thee of the same
My word does make thee free,
and they that teach to thee my lore
Are all most svveet to thee
3.
Their speech is full of grace, and love
To those that hear the same
their words are impt with zeal of love
To keep thee from all blame
4.
Those that do rule, and giude the stearne
Are as the neck to head
They are both strong, and stout to guard
The souls that they have fed?
Christ speaks to his spouse.
5.
The two svveet books of league most nevve
Are breasts full fraught with milk,
And all that suck the joyce of the^
Are clad in robes of silk.
6.
That is the grace of Saints, and such
Shall shine in rays of rest
Till day does davvne, and shad does fade,
And they for aye be blessed.
7.
Thus art thou fair, my love in me
In thee there is noe spott.
I will in bliss set thee my dear
Clean void of sin, or blott.
The fifth speech.
Christ speaks still.
1.
O now my love I have thee sought,
And brought thee from the lands
I have the led in bands of grace
From out the curse, and bands.
2.
To me from all parts of the earth
I will the giude, and call,
and quite thou shall be from the bands
Of them that did thee thra^l.
3.
Who once did vex, and grieve thee sore
In bane, in blood, in vvoe,
But I will set thee safe from them,
And rid thee from thy foe.
4.
For thou my heart have caught with love
One cast of thy fair e^e
Of faith I mean does vvound my heart
which made me faint, and die
Christ speaks still.
5.
All svveets the world can yeald to me
Are banes to thy svveet ^mell,
Thou art my spouse, in life, and death
The grave shall not thee quell.
6.
The words which from thy lips do drop
When thou do pray, or praise.
Are far more svveet to me then svveets
That sun does see by days
7.
Thou art a spring to me shutt up
A well sealed by my ring,
From vvhe^ce does flow pure streams of love
To me thy lord, and king.
The sixth speech.
Christ speaks.
1.
THou art closd up my spouse, my Dear
That none might do thee ill,
That force of foes, nor rage of fe^ds
On thee might do their will.
2.
That noe vvild Boore of vvood so fell
Thy roots, thy plants might mar
For I look on thee with mine eyes,
And view their ire a far.
3.

And as thou vvilt, so will I take
These fruits a part of thee.

For they are mine I gave the^ thee,
And all else that is meet.

That yett in this dear love of min^
Such grace, and love do find.

And is set to the tune of Lord be my judge, and thou shall see PSALM. CXXVI.

To his much esteemed good friend Mr. WALTER PELL one of the assistants of the
most worthy company of the marchants-Adventurers residing at Hamb:
Joy of both worlds. Loving friend. If you would die well, you must endeavor
to live well. Then let your death be never so sudden, It will not come
unexpected neither will you be unprepared. The days, and houers of days that
you have spent in gods service either in praying, or praising him shall be so
many cordialls of comforts, ^ consciences of well led purposes, and will so
take up your heart in joy, and solace, that noe terror of death, or darkness
shall appale yt. Who would not then be busy in this so serious, so sacred a
business? Let us never think to be soundly merry, if this be not our music.
Reason, and Religion guides us here unto. For veary Reason shows unto us
that we must all die, and Religion enlighteneth us how we may dye well.
Fools judge actions by events, But the wise for see by judgment of reason,
and faith what will inevitably ensue. To this purpose all this is said. That
as I have in mine endeered love sent you an introduction hereunto in this paper
token so you would accept, and practice it. So shall I ever rest your votary
praying to god for your eternal happiness in Christ Jesus his saving mercies.

Your perpetual votary. W. LO.

The first speech.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
1.
I am come down o spouse most dear
To take those fruits of thine,
Which thou with heart of grace, and love
Do know of erst were mine.
2.
I have thought well of all thy works,
As well of will as deed.
I drank thy wine with milk so svveet
With love they do me feed.
3.
o you my friends, and saints most blessed
Cheer up your selves with me,
And joy your hearts with this my spouse
whose cates of love you see
The church speaks.
4.
When once this world had luld in sleep
Of sin, my self, my se^ce
Yet vvakt mine heart to Christ my Dear,
and thou did dravve me thence.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
5.
Thou camst to me, and knockst full often
At door of my poor heart
Thou knockst I say full often my d^re
And pearst me with thy dart.
6.
And said I Will come, and lodge with thee,
And dvvell with thee in grace.
Shut out the world, thy sins, thy shame*
and let me come in place.
7.
For all the night I wait for thee,
My locks with dropps of pain
Are vvett, and all to stay for thee
That I thy love might gain.
The second speech.
The Church speaks.
1.
I have put of my coat said I,
How shall I put it on.
My feet I vvasht, shall I them ^ile
Oh noe, my love be gone.
2.
Thus did I plead for my long stay
For who so loves my dear
Must care, and carke, and strange things taste
Of vvoe him to come near.
3.
For clean of soil, of vvoe, and ill
Who lives that seeks my dear
No, No, the world will plague the^ all
That serves our god in fear
4.
But when my love these words did hear
He shrunk, and went me fro,
and hid him self, and spoke no^ more
That I had searud him so.
The Church speaks.
5.
And then I rouzd my heart I yearnd
That had him lost so sone
I rose, and lokt, and chid my self
For that which I had done.
6.
I sought him but he hid him self,
And would not me come nigh
I roard, and cride, and vsd all means
I card not for to die.
7.
For that I had lost him my dear
That sought me for his dove,
But yet I found him not, nor knew
He hard my voice in love.
The third speech.
The church speaks still.
1.
THe men that should have had a care
They smote, and did me vvound,
With words most false, and vain they sought,
To ding me to the ground.
2.
I charge you all that love the lord
If that you shall him find
Tell him how sick I am of love
In heart, in soul, in mind.
3.
O what (say they) is this thy Dear
More then the sons of men
That thou art thus far go^ in love,
And aye do not him ken.
4.
My love said I is white, and red
His face is pure, and bright
He is the chief, and choice, of all
In him is all the light
The church speaks still.
5.
For god in him is full, and fair
In grace, in face, in all.
His head fine gold, his locks (...) flocks
In him there is no gall
6.
His eyes like doves full of pure love
His cheeks as beds of spice,
His lips as svveet, as flovvers in May.
To me he is not nice.
7.
His hands are set with port, and pri^
Pure myrrh does dropp him fro
His will is rule of truth, and faith
This is most true I know
The fourth speech.
The spouses speaks.
1.
Yea all his acts are firm, and strong
As set in gold most sure.
No shevve of change, but straight, and clear
Both sound, and safe, and pure
2.
His mouth is as svveet things of choice
From vvhe^ce does flow my bliss
He is all svveet, in part, in whole,
And I poor soul am his.
A foreign congregation speaks.
3.
Since then o dear such is thy love,
Shevve us where he is found,
And we will seek this love with t^ee
In all the world so round
4.
For no^e, but thee o church can him
Make known, in word, in deed
O tell us then, and we will join,
And he shall be our meede.
The spouses speaks.
5.
The^ said I to those that him sought
He is gone down to be
In beds of spice with souls, and saints
That is my love, that's he
6.
Yea I am his in his sweet love,
And he is mine by faith.
In spite of hell, or sin, or shame
His word to me so says.
7.
And both of us are one in god,
And knitt in soul, and spright
By love most svveete, and joy of heart
I live still in his sight.
The fifth speech.
Christ speaks to his church
1.
Though thou my church did me not seek,
But putts me far thee fro,
Yet now thou do look back to me
I will not serve thee so.
2.
But I will come, and dvvell with thee
In grace, in love, in awe.
I will thee joy, in mirth, and glee,
And teach to thee my law.
3.
Turn back thine eyes from me my dear
That are thus fixed on me
Thy strength of faith does joy me so
That I mind none, but thee.
4.
The men that feed thy soul with food
Have all one heart, one tongue
They tune all like a quire of saints
They sound forth all one song.
Christ speaks to his church.
5.
So that their pains are not (...) vai^
They bring to me much fruit.
They cry, and call to me for help,
And I do hear their suite.
6.
Thy locks, thy looks, are seen so fair
Thy blush, thy smile so svveet.
That I do joy in them that teach
Those things that are so meet
7.
Though kings, and Queens, and all folk else
My name, my love do use,
Yet on thee, on thee love I look
On thee I think I muse.
The ^ixt ^peach.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
1.
THou art my spouse most chaste most pure
Whom all the world does love
Thou art my dear, my peer, my joy,
Noe spott in thee my Dove.
2.
Those that do look, and see thy face
Do praise, and plaud thee still,
And bless thee that have god thy lord,
and did yeald to his will.
3.
and thus they say rapt with thy state
What Is she so fair as morn
So pure as su^ne, so bright as moan,
Of what state is she borne.
4.
Her face is fair through force of faith
She is most bright in heue
Yea in her looks is fear, and dread
To cause her foes to rue.
The spouse speaks to Christ.
5.
And thus all gast, and rapt with sight
Of thy svveet port, and state
They stand in stond all pale, and wan
For thee they can not mate.
6.
No more then glympse of star ca^ dashe
The su^ne in hight of sky,
Or light on earth the moon at full
Can dark or once come nigh.
7.
Cheer up thy self dear love I say
For though thou did me miss*
I mean not thee my love to leave
For all the world that is.
The seventh speech.
Christ speaks to his spouse
1.
^ did but go to see my vine
How it did bud, and sprout
To see what fruits my plants did yeald
And how they were come out.
2.
And now I see they bud, and blooe,
And yeald me fruit good store.
^le care for them, and they for me
That they may have the more.
3.
The souls that came to me of late
I prune, I plash, I purge
That they may bring forth far more fruit
With this my rod, and scourge.
4.
And now they are well grown my Dear
I have, I run to thee,
With speed at need I have, I post
With vvings of vvind to see.
Christ speaks to his spouse.
5.
What thou do want, or would now have
Speak love, I Will give thee it.
Thou shall not fear my love to thee
In rest by thee i will sit.
6.
Come then my love to me full fast
Let all Saints joy, and sing.
To house of god i will safe, and sound
My Dear shall my love bring.
7.
Now all ye Saints, and souls on high
Look, see, fix fast your eye,
On this my love, mark well her grace.
No fault in her I spy.

To his much esteemed good friend Mr. WILLIAM WALCOT merchant, one of the most
vvorthie company of Merchant Adventurers residing at Hamborough.
Happiness for ever.

KInd friend. Forced favors were ever slighted, and thankles. But voluntary
respects had ever with the best, and most noble minds courteous accepta^ce
how small, and mean soever the thing was. For a man to give his soul to
his Creator when he sees he must dye, and his goods to the poor, when he
sees he must part with them, and to forgo our sin, vv^ we can noe longer
follow yt are cold, yea unkind obediences. But for a young man to remember
his creator in the days of his yout ^ and in his best, and strongest age (...)
bequeath himself every day to god in prayer, and praise is thatreasonable, and
seasonable sacrifice where with the most high is most pleased. To this
purpose and noe other god knovveth I have tendered these voluntary Essaies to
diverse of my masters, and Tablebrothers. Let me not seem to to officious,
while I desire to do good, and express my love. For (...) unto the rest so
unto you Beloved Ga^-naunt have I sent this parcel. Receive yt, as I mean yt
both with hand, and heart, and then ^ am assured; it will never repent you of
your acceptance, nor me of my dedication. The great lord keeper of heaven, and
earth keep you in his fear all the days of your life, and preserve you for
his saving mercies in Christ Jesus in the end of your life, and for ever.

Yours in Christ to be required. W. LO.

Thy teats are full of milk, and mirth
And yeald thy babes great store

To cure all vvounds as Balm.

Good works of faith, and life*
And vv^h her power to drive (...) her

Her words shall spring a^ wine

But if it did I would not pass,
Nor think of it so much.
3.
Then would I bring thee to the light
Though now pent up in dark,
And then thou should me teach to know

A METAPHRASE.

Of the first, and second chap^ers of Ieremies Lamentations for ^he sacking,
and burning of Jerusalem, and ^he temple, by Nebuchadnezer king of Babell, and
by Nebuzaradan the captain of his guard, put into monosyllables of great
Britains language.

And is set to the tune of I lift mine heart to thee. PSALM. XXV.

To his much esteemed good friend Mr. EDWARD MEEDE one of the assistants of the
most worthy company of Merchants Adventurers residing at Hamborough.
Grace in this world, and joy in the other. ALL happiness in the lord Jesus. I
present unto you a part of Ieremies Lamentations metaphrased. You may see
herein my true heart unto you all. In the midst of lamentable disco^tents I
tuned my soul, tongue, and pen to the land of god. And the rather in these
lamentations for that they sorted some what to my retired meditations. One
time, or other all men are not as they would be. It is the condition of gods
children. Happy is that man that can use gods scourge to his amen dement. The
great moderator of all things knovves his children fittest to be made palms,
to be spread with burdens, and vvaights, and not to be Olives. That so we
might more think of our victory, then of our rest. It is enoughe for us that
we shall once triumph in heaven, and rest for all. To this holy rest, and
eternal tranquillity godgiude us all, into whose blessed keeping I recommend
you in Christ saving mercies. And rest.

Yours much devoted. W. LO.

All joy, and happiness in Christ. Well-beloved in the lord. We are all strangers
here in the earth, our home is above in heaven. It was a great grief to gods
Israel to tune the songs of Sion in a strange country. How then is it with
us, that we like so well of the things here, and think not of the blessings
above. Jerusalem was once the mistrisse of the world, the Metropolis of the
earth, and ye^ when the worlds darling for gatt god she was laid in the dus^
That is the cause of the Prophet lamentation. Indeed who would not shovver
down tears to (...) the holy place de^iled, and Ierusa^ made an heap of
stones? But we see noe place be it never so glorio^ in our eyes, noe persons
be they never so gracious in the sight of men that can escape gods (...) when
he will scourge The Turks have encroched into Christendom, and made that
^itty of Constantinople which was once the glory of the east, a veary cage of
unclean Mahumetans. What Christians heart does not bleed to see yt? to hear of

that our hearts were touched with remorse for the poor distressed Christians

Seven dumpes

ON THE SEVEN WORDS that Christ spoke on the cross which shevve the seven
depthes of the laws curse, which our lord did feel for our sins.

And is set to the tune of I lift mine heart to thee.

PSALM. XXV. To his much esteemed good friend Mr. GEORGE FRANKLYN on of the
Assistants of the most worthy company of marchants-Adventurers residing at
Hamb:
Grace here, Glory hereafter in Christ.

Loving, and beloved. The words of a dying father, or of a dying friend are
wont to take deep impression in the minds, and memories of good natures.
Whose words shall pearce, if the words of our Christ our dying Christ, and
that for us, and his last also. Whose I say if not his? To you I send the last
words of Christ, in the last place, yet you are not the least in my love. The
first in intention, is last in excecution. And nothing is conveayed to the
intellectual powers that is not first in the sensible parts. It was gods
purpose of our Christ even in the creation, that he should be thus upon the
cross. See then your Christ at his last. Tune your doleful dumps to a sad
soul, and joy in sobbs. For he prays, cries, yells, promises, perfecteth
all, that we may be all in all with god. What can be more? Christ passion is
the model of our profession, yea the medall of our perfection. For gods
strength is perfected in our weakness.

We may sovve in tears, we shall reap in joy. Let my spring be vvett so that
I may have a plentiful Autumn I care not. Vir dolorum can best tune his voice
to dolours. If god will have it so, His will be done. He did so with his
own. We cannot imagine our condition free. God giude us through all by his
saving grace, To which I shall ever recommend you, and rest.

Your more then much affectionate. W. LO.

My poor heart is so full,

That its nighe rent to see thy love
So much, so maine for me
3.
O take thy cross, and nails,
And strain my heart at length
That thy dear love may not be pent,
But shevve my soul thy strength
4.
And now my thoughts are free
Thy love to view in sight
My heart does pant for that noe more

5.
O fill my heart once more,
And stretch, and strain it still
That I may loathe, and love no more
My sin that brought this ill.
6.
But I want space in heart,
And grace in all my life,
To end my smart in sight of this,
And sins that are so rife.

5.
Its done, Its done says Christ
Ye all is past, and clear
That thou my soul may live in bliss,
and be to god most dear
6.
Is this the way o Christ,
That we taste vvoe with thee,
That so we may once rule, and reign
And thy svveet face still see.
7.
O let thy will o lord,
Be done of us in fine.
And by us let thy will be done
That still we may be thine.

Father into thy hands do I commend my spirit. Luck. 23. verse. 46.
1.
O come joy of mine heart,
and seize my soul with this,
What is there ought in the vvide world
That ca^ be more to bliss.
2.
Then for my soul to hear

In to the hands of god my lord
There still for aye to live.
3.
Now soul thou see thy bliss,
And where thou may be sure,
To have thy rest, thy joy, thy stay
Thy love, thy life, thy cure.

O blessed are they that dye,
They rest from all their care
When once the lord does set them free
What Death, or Hell can dare?
5.
In his o soul thy Christ
For thine made suite to god
Thou needst not fear the day of death
Nor grave, nor hell his rod

For thou art safe in him

And it is hid in Christ thy lord
What can thou vvishe now more.
7.
O soul Die in these words
Give up thy self in fine
To god in Christ, and fear no ill
For he says, Thou art mine.
To him that made these Hymns.
WHen with my thoughts I view thy saynct like muse
How on while drencht in sobs, and sighs for sin.
And yet more l^vv, the Paths of death does use.
There seisd with greef: yet prays: then sours even in
Heavens gate it self: and there true love does find
And then its Christ does see, and vevv: his pain
His cross: his speare-pearst side, his greef of mind
Thence dumpt tvvixt joy, and greef: as: on half slain
I must, even at thy muse how well: how fit it lymms.
Its greef, sobs, sighs, and tears, in tunes, in songs, and hymns
I. P.

To him that made these hymns
There Is but one god, that this world one has made,
One Christ, one Truth, one faith, one hope, one love,
To serve this one, in hymns of ones, do shade
Thy zeal, to teach us that in one we move.
Lo, as thy hymns be ones, so is thy name but odd,
How fit? both name, and hymns do join to praise one god,
Thus ten, and one, in one thou have now framd,
That we in one should keep the law often,
Thus by seven, and seven thou have them so namd
For seven times seven day by day we break them.
Lo, your hymns, of one* Ten, and one, and seven by seven
Learns, god to laud, his law to keep, the way to heaven.
