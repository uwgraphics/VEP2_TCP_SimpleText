The Ioviall Peddler. OR,
A merry new Ditty
Which is both harmless
Pleasant and witty.
To a pleasant new tune.


Here was a Ioviall Pebler,
And he cryde Cony-skins,
^^d on his back he had a pack
^^ll of points and pins,
^^th laces and braces
^d other pretty things.
Hey down he down
With a hey down, down,
Down, derry, derry, down,
The Peddler, never ^ins
But still does cry
So merry merrily,
Maids have you any Cony, Cony skins.
Maids bring out your Cony-skins,
The Peddler does you pray
For them you may have points or pins
Be they bla^^ (...) gray,
The Pedlar to an Alehouse went
And called for beer and ale,
In midst of all his merriment
His purse began to fail.
His laces and braces
And all his pretty things
hey down,
With a hey down, down,
Down.
When he came to pay the shot
His heart grew very cold,
For he had broke a black pot
Which made his Ostesss Scold.
And all his money spent
Which made him to lament
hey down
With a day
The Peddler took his cony-skins,
And his Cob, web Lawn,
The Peddler took his points and pins,
laid them there to pawn:
(...) and braces*
The second part
to the same tune


The Peddler he went drunk to bed,
And when he did awake,
When he remembered what he did,
It made his heart to ache.
His Ostesse had his ware,
And left him very bare.
hey down
He to his Ostesse fair did say,
And did prevail so far,
He got his ware of her again,
And took his leave of her:
He took up his pack
And hung it on his back.
hey down.
The highway it was very deep
Which sortly troubled him,
Through the water did he creep,
And set his ware to swim:
His lates and braces,
And all his pretty things.
hey down,
The Peddler on a hill did get,
And laid his ware to dry,
His cony-skins was very wet.
Which grieved him wondrously
His laces and braces,
And all his pretty things.
hey down.
The Peddler he fell fast asleep,
And as a sleep he lay:
Up the hill a Knave did creep,
And stele his ware away,
His laces and braces,
And all his pretty things.
hey down.
The Peddler waked from his sleep,
sound his ware was gone,
(...)eep
With an empty pack
To show what he did lack
hey down,
There was two lovely Less,
That in one house old dwell.
The one of them was bony Kate,
The other bouncing Nell:
And either of them both had Cony-skins to sell.
hey down
Kate brought forth her Cony-skins
From under-neath the Laires,
They were as black as any Iet,
And full of silver hairs:
The Peddler would have bought them
Rather then his ears.
hey down,
Nell brought forth hers to sell
One of another view,
They were as good as good might be
And that the Peddler knew.
The saucy Jack set down his pack,
And set his wares to view,
hey down
Besse went tripping ore the green
With one poor Cony-skin,
Because she would not have it seen,
Or known where she had bin:
She closely hid the same
Until the Peddler came.
hey down,
The Maidens of Camberwell
Brought forth their skins,
But when they came their ware to sell,
The Peddler head no pins,
Nor laces, nor ^races,
Nor suc^ pr^ty ^^ings.
hey down,
The Maidens have trust
With their Cony skins,
and he hat^ (...)'d
