De co^temptu mundi.

The dispisyng of the world, co^piled in latin by Erasmus Rot. and translated
in to english by Thomas Paynell, Chano^ of Marten abbey.

To the most high / most virtuous / and most excellent princess / the
most noble queen Mary dowager of France / daughter and sister unto the most
victorious kings of England and of France / your humble orator Thomas Paynel
prays good health and prosperity.
IN time paste princess most excellent / religion was not only a thing
highlye esteemed / but also had in right greatte honor and reverence / and
not despised and littell set by / as hit is now a days: but they that so do
/ either be such as can not be content to live straytely and hardly them
self / for so they repute a religious and a good life / or else they be such
as be slyden and fallen a side from the right believe. But yet there is none be
he never so delycately given to pleasure / or swarued so far wide from the
true believe / that can so maliciouslye blame or bark against religion: but
that he shall find an hundred again / that were not only virtuous and
perfect good men / but also most excelle^tly learned / the which do highly
magnify and preyse religion / ye and with long eloquent orations and pistils
they exhort and stere the doulce delycate fellows of the world / that be
ignorante / what a sweet / what a quiet / and what a holy life is led in
religion / to come there unto. Than who is he that would believe one or two
frantic fools / rather than a thousand of wise / sad / sobre / prudent /
and perfect good lyuers? I have thought many times / what name should be
most convenient for these folyshe and mad fellows / that go about to
dispreyse religion (if they be worthy to have any name at all). For true
religion is the very way to salvation. And except religion / what proprete
shall ye find in man kind / but that ye shall commonly find the same in
beastis? Therefore they be very brute / and may well be called beastis / that
set naught by religion / and irreverently dispreyse it. And what though some
lewd persons / led by lust and riotte / set naught by religion / yet
hit is never the worse / nor there is none that is well disposed and that has
any wisdom or understanding / that will bear ever the less love and
affection thereunto / for any man's malignite. But yet to thentent that such
wicked and folyshe fellows should not abasshe or afraye the corages and good
minds / that they bear unto religion / the which as yet be but rude, and
have no groundly knowledge or understanding / how good and how requisite hit
is for man's soul health: some time the most noble and excellent clerks (as I
said before) endyte erudite orations and eloquente exhortations / to open and
declare the high goodness of religion: as Erasmus has done in this littell
book following / the which book translated by me in to english / I was so
bold to dedicate to your grace princess most excellent / as to the very
patroness and favorer of holy religion.

For all though ye be a queen / and have always kept a state of a princess
most high / shynynge in glory and riches / and thereto furnyshed with all most
honorable pleasures and delytes / belonging to nobilite / yet have you ben
always most virtuous, devout, and charitable. The which great piety and godly
mind enforced me to dedicate this small book to your grace: humbly desiringe
your excellent majesty to accept this my rudenes: And I shall daily pray: God
encreace your grace / virtue / and honor. Amen.

Erasmus Roterodamus unto the reder sends gretynge.
I Have many times complained most gentle reder / that I was agreued with the
love and favor of my fre^des / the which (not with standing that I am a live,
and co^mande the contrary) do vulgate and put forth abroad such trifils as I
wrote wha^ I was yo^ge to exercise my style, not thy^kyng that they should be
spredde abroad and common for every man to have: wherein I am so much more
unhappy / that they be spredde and come forth in this most happy time and
season, where, if they had come to light when they were first compyled and
made, they should not have been so much subject to men's dispreyses and
derisions. Now they be read / as they were made of an aged man / the which I
compiled when I was young / not for that entente: and they be read in this
time / which has diverse men of excellent lernyng and great understanding.
Whilom when I was scantly.xx. years of age / at the desire and instance of a
certain man called Theodorike / the which yet lives / I wrote a pystill / by
the which his intent was to call his nephewe Joyce to the fellowship of his
life. To this pistill often times copied and spredde al about / they have put
my name / where as I have no nephewe that is called Joyce. I wrote hit for an
other man's intent and purpose: And as it self does openly express / I wrote
hit negligentlye for my pass time / using no study nor exquisite arguments:
nor also to I was not than enstructed in redyng of good auctours. And openly
they thretned to put it in printe / except that I would cause it to be printed.
So I read it over / and when I had changed a few words / I was content hit
should be printed. Thus I suppose hit will come to pass at length / that I
shall forgo the love that I have to the folyshnesse and tryfyls of my youth.
Fare well good reder / and if thou read it / read it with forgyuenesse / and so
read it / as written for an other man's intent and purpose.

Theodorike Harleme to Joyce his most cunnyng nephewe / sends gretyng.
CErtainly my most dear and well-beloved Joyce / I have had of long time / a
right great desire to write unto ye: but hyderto I have kept syle^ce / more for
shamefastness than negligence: for I drad leest when I prepared my self / I
that am not much elder than thou / but in other things far under the / to
exhort the that art a man of singular prudence and erudition / should be seen
and reputed to take in hand / a labor that neded not / as one would cast
water in to the sea: not for that I have any doubt / that thou (which art so
exceeding good and gentle) would not after the best manner accept mine
exhortation / but leest I should seem to take upon me the office of an immodest
or an unshamefast person / to presume to give the admonicion / where it were
more conuenyent that I should be exhorted and monyshed of the. Therefore what
shall I do? Shall I write or no? Shamefastenes forbyddeth me to write: but than
on the other side / the love that I bear to ye Joyce will not suffer it. Shall
my mind than be evermore in doubt and wauerynge? Love on the tone part
counsayleth me to write / and shamefastness on the other side moves me to ye
contrary. And there is welnere nothing more grievous or peynfull than a
doutfull mind. But at the last / it that of right ought to overcome shall
have place? Shamefastnes shall obey unto love. For I should rather esteem thy
profytte / yea thy soul health / than what men will say by me. If that this
mine enterprise shall be more applied to pride than wisdom / trewely mine
offense should so much the sooner be forgyuen / in as much as it proceeds of
love. For undoubted / I had leauer writing louyngly / do boldly / than wisely
keeping silence / to do more wisely. Nor I doubt not, but by this patron and
advocate (I mean our love) I shall be absolved and quited. For our love is not
simple or of the common sort / but very entier / trusty and sure. The causes
of our twos frendshyp be right great and manyfolde: our bringing up together
of children / ye maruaylous agreement of our two minds / one manner of study in
most noble scyences / the innumerable pleasures that thou haste done for me /
the singular beneuole^ce and special good mind of the and of thine borne
always toward me. And also to these causes / is joined alyaunce of blood. What
thing can be more gluynge or claspyng than this our frendeshyp / the which
as it were with a double theyne / is bound and knyt fast together / on the one
side with kynred / and on the other side with fyxed charity or entyerly loving
minds. Therefore Joyce I would thou should think and surely trust that never
man loved him self more heartily than I love ye. And seeing that I love the as
much as my self or more / I must needs care as much for thy soul health as
for mine own. Yea and true love constraynethe us (I wot not by what mean) to
sorrow more grievously our friends inco^modyte and hurt than our own / and
more to desire our friends welfare than our own. And brefely to speak / true
love causes one man to love an other more tenderlye than him self. Which
thing in the I need not to mystruste / but on my part I may surely affirm
hit. This thing has so much enbolded and encoraged me / that I laid
shamefastnes aparte for the time / and wrote unto the this letter of exortation
/ by ye which my mind is to withdraw the from the hurly burly / and
business of the world / and bring the to a life monastycke / that is to say
/ solytary and quyete. This is no small thing / nor a thing that may soon be
persuaded to the common people: but because thy life is of such perfytenes all
ready / that except the habit or clothyng of a lay man (whereof I am very glad)
the world welnere can challenge no properte in the. I fullye trust that this
mine exhortation shall take effect / saying that both the courage of thy
passing good mind and my oration lead the to the same thing. Who would
doubt that ship to sail pleasantly / that has both wind and wether at
will: And all be hit that thy good and commendable life stereth me to hope well
/ yet shall I never be out of fear and dread / until such time that thou
clean forsake this unhappy and britel world: and enter in to some Monastery /
as in to an haven most sure. For trust me / as often as I reuolue and
consydre in my mind the perils and dangers, among the which thou art
conuersante (Whereupon I think welnere always) so often the tender love that I
bear to the ward / makes me very heavy and sorrowful. For I am none other
wise affectioned or minded toward the / than a good kind mother is to her
only and most dear child / the which is on the sea saylynge by some
dangerous place / where as ships often times go to wrack and peryshe /
Which when she sees or hears the vyolente hurl wind rise ruggedly alofte
/ she wayleth / she waxes pale / and tre^bleth for dread: In her sleep her
mind rounneth / and she dreameth of her son: and ever she dredeth the worste
/ and more than is true or need to be feared. But would to god yt I neded not to
dread less perils tha^ be. But I know / I know good Ioice / what troubles be
in the sea of this world / in what danger the life stands / and what diverse
kinds of death there be: out of the which but late swimming naked on a little
board / uneath I escaped. But perauenture thou being in a folyshe surete of thy
self / and calling me tymerous or fearful / will bid me to be careless: but
yet if thou so do, thou can not drive fear out of my my^de: for thou art so
far wide to draw me from dread / that thou almost bryngest all my hope to
naught. Trewely thou art so much the more in the danger of perils / in how
much less that thou perceiuest them: or if thou do understand and perceive
them / and will not beware and eschew them / what thing can be more
myschiefull or more mad than such a confydence. I pray the tell me / who is
more foolysshe than that shipman / the which among the spuminge or fomynge
rocks / the furious syrtes / the rageyng goulfes of the sea / in a great and
hydous te^peste / and thereto his ship feeble and weak / does fear no manner
peril / but lyenge up right by the helm he syngeth / yea / and forbyddeth
those that sail with him under his tuition / to be afraid or careful? What
man will not abhor the folly and madness of such a fellow / and dread to escape
safely? Nor I good Joyce / shall never be rydde of care so long as thou
foolehardely doste sail forth in this most vnquyete see of the world. Thou
will perauenture say / this is a foolysshe comparison: How does the world
and the sea agree / seeing that nothing is more bla^dyshyng or faunyng tha^
the world / and nothing is more horrible than the sea? Yea but I know no
feter comparison / if thou consydre hit well. Thynkest thou that the ill
melodye and sweet honygalle tunes of the Sirens / the which bring the
passagers forby first in a slombre / and after drown them: does not well
express the shrewde blandishynge / and lewd delites of this world? would to
god thou coudest se what snares / what desceytes / and what nets / they lay
pryuyly to attrappe thy youth with. Look therefore that thou fly from the
ba^kes or see coostes where these Sirens be. For flyghte in this behalf is the
surest way. Nor thou should not folehardely trust to sail sure and safely
that way / where as thou see king Dauyd / Solomon / and many other / and
nobler tha^ are to be spoken of here / went to wrack. And brefely to speak: no
man escaped but he that fled. Homer reherseth that Ulyxes / the which
represents the person of a perfect wise man / with greatte study and
dylygence could scarsly escape the sweet honygalle song of these Sirens / and
yet he stopped his ears with wax / and bound him self to the ship maste.
Than what hope haste thou to escape them? Seeing yt so many have co^spired
together to distroy the / as wa^ton youth / e^ticyng beautifulness / riches
license / libertee / the daily and nightly ditees of these (Helas) to sweet
monsters. Nor I think not / but that these hie apperyng sharp rockis / I
mean the highness of secular dygnytees / are as much to be dredde of the:
among the which if thou be driven by any cool of wind / thou shalt think
it goth with the right well / if swymmynge on a small bourde / the storm cast
the on land in some unknown place. What thynkeste thou by the insatiable
deuowrynge Carybdes? the which / as good authors rehearse / when a ship
swyftely saylynge comes within the danger thereof / is wont to resyst / and
oftentimes to whyrle it about / and swalowe in the same ship. Is this an
unlikely figure and comparyson unto covetousness? the which tourneth a man's
mind to insatiable desire / and will not suffer him in quyete / until it has
drowned him in hell. And by the furious Syrtes thou may understand the
insuperable mocion of anger / and the more the same offense is / the more
copyous or abundaunt the matter thereof is. Do not the wyndes plainly express
as well the pestilent words of flaterers as of detractours and bacbyters? and
though it forces not from whens these wyndes blow / yet they are ever to be
feared. For if thou be driven among the craggy rough rocks / whether it be by
wyndes of prosperity or aduersite / yet never the less thou shalt be driven
upon Syrtes. And what supposest thou by the terrible alterations and surgynges
of the wawes / some time rysynge up as high as the sterres / and an one
falling down in to them self again. How conveniently do they sygnify the
mutabilite and varyablenesse of fortune? Wherewith a broken mind is for ye more
pert brought out of patience / for he that was now rich and in high
prosperity / can not bear pacyently sodeyne calamyte. I over pass here the
tempests and storms / I speak not of the nyghtes errors / nor of the
desceyuable planettes: Nor I rehearse not the manifold / and diverse kinds of
monsters / the which are bredde and noryshed in the sea / these thou shalt by
thine own wisdom call unto thy mind / and more better interpretate what
they mean. Nor thou should not trust the sea when hit seems smothe and
caulme / nor when the clear glassy storms be swaged and laid / nor when the
air is fair and clear: for all this is done to the end that the sudden tempest
might find the unprovided and a sleep. And therefore I doubt greatly / whether
there be any thing more contrary / more hurtful / or more foe unto virtue
than prosperity. For as scripture does witness. Calamite and misfortune
breaks many a one: but good fortune and prosperity dissolueth or mollyfyeth
many mo. Therefore be thou wise and well ware / and trust not the smiling world:
lest when thy ship is ron to wrack and broken (which god forbid) I should be
feign to lament the with these verses of the poet.

O Palynure, O governor and chief guide
Of Aeneas ship, vvherin that prince did sail
For all thy great cunnyng, thou coudest not preuyde
The danger of the sea, that the did assail
The casting of thy compass did little prevail
Trusting to much caulme vvedder and fair skies
Upon the sea sand, deed naked when thou lies.
Of the dangerous dwelling in the world. The.ii. Chap.
See thou not most gentyl Joyce what great perils enuiron and compass the
about on every side? To whom the very tranquillyte or quyete hit self is
dangerous? What trowest thou so to over come and withstand these peryls / that
thou shalt on no part take hurt or have mishap / namely in thy youth /
which of his own brayde without any other entycement does enclyne to sin
and ill disposition? But thou will say thus. I hope to do well. Thou may
hope and trust well / and I also hope well: but I fear me leest we both shall
hope in vain. Therefore I would thou shuldeste make this our hope to be some
what more surer. But I lyghly coniecte / what thou will think and mutter /
when thou redest these my words. Be these things in so great sauetye. Shall
relygious men only be saved and all other perish? No forsooth. For I deny not
/ but there have been many living in this world that be saved. Nor they that
enter in to a monasterye of relygion / do not forth with settyll them self so
/ that they may safely live clean without care. But yet natwithstandynge /
there is as great dyfference between these two manner of lyuynges / as is
between him that lies at rode in the haven / though he has not yet bowed his
ankers: and him that yet saylethe alofte in the main see. Or else between him
that swymmethe in the water / and him that iourneth by land. He perishes not
that remains in the world / but he is more nere unto peril. Therefore good
Joyce / seeing that I would the so much good / ye and perauenture desire more
thy welfare than thou do thy self / look that thou eschew all peryls / and
put thy self in sauegarde. For the wise man says: He that loves peril shall
peryshe therein. I pray ye / what need have thou to be tossed with the ragynge
wawes of water / when thy way lies more sure and commodiously by land? who
(but he that is stark blind / sees not / that it is far more surer / more
plesaunte / and more commodious to journey through the plesaunte grene meadows
without dread / than among so many images of death to be turned and went with
perpetual vexatio^ and trouble? Is not this a great blyndenes / that we delight
in our aduersyte / and as Uyrgyll says / to take pleasure to give our self
to foolyshe and mad labor?

what sport, what pleasure, or what solatious rest
Is in these vvorldly vvavves, to be tossed and cast
wherefore approach the hydder, and thou shall find it best
For here is the fresshe time of Vere that does last
Here be christallyne ryuers enuyron compast
The soil and ground, enbroudred with svvete flowers
Here grows the pople tree, to shadovve us from spoures
within these dens delectable, of fresshe pyplyng cold
Under these vynes here, enclustred with grapes
There be sovereign shadows, from storms us to wtholde
Dravve hydder, and renofice these vvorldly tryflyng iapes
And set the vvylde wavves vvorlre, that betes and grates
Upon the rough rocks, of vvorldly pomp and pride
Here be fresshe fountayns, that spring on every side
Here be the svvete medovves, with grass enuerdred grene
Orchyardes and greaues, with trees of diverse fruit
with herbers to rest in, and alleys kept clean
Like to Paradyse of pleasure to take our refute
Of solace incomparable, this place I repute
Here might I find in mine heart with the to endure
From all vvorldly danger, for here are we sure.
IT has plesed me with this Uirgils ditee to allure the away from worldly
troubles to our delectable life. But I wotte not with what iougglynges the
lewd smilyng show of this world has bewytched the eyes of thy mind / and
stays and stycketh fast to thy mind as though it were glewed. And forth
with the same fair pai^ted face of world things comes to thy remembrance /
and with smiling calls the back again / when thou art about to leave them
saying? what will thou do mad man? Go thou about to distroy both thy
self and thyn? O cruel person / wylt thou forsake us after this manner? Will
thou despise thy loving fellows and frendis? Have thou no pite on thy father
and mother? In what case thynkest thou that she shall be / the which heartily
loves the / and that for thy love distroyeth her self / and that desires the
to her spouse and husband? Advise the well what thou will do? For this thy
cendre youth and beauty are more convenient for other things. And thou art
to soft and delycate of Nature to take on the and perform an hard religion.
Ah wylt thou suffer ye flower of thy youth so unworthily to fade away? Will
thou solitary alone still waylynge spend away thy lustye youth? Thou should
leave that to them that be aged / unto whom now the life is no longer sweet.
Thou art a young man / what thing else should thou do but sport and play?
At leest wise considre / what abundance of richesse thou haste all redye / and
much more is coming / if thou will tarry and abide it. Thou art now right
honorable / and yet thou shall be higher in honor if thou slynke not away from
us. These be the things that all men seek fore: and thou alone forsakest them:
wha^ they be al ready sought out and got to thy hand. But will thou go thy
way and never return again to take fruition of these joys / richesse /
commodites / and profits? Yet at the lest I pray the tarry a while / take a
breath in the matter: for hastynes is cause of much hurt and inconvenience.
Haste thou hard these exhortations? Have thou hard the^? These be the very
voices of the Sirens: but as thou love thy health / look that thou lysten nor
give none heryng to them. Show thy self to be Ulyxes: They will bewytche thy
mind if thou harken to them: They be such fair flaterers / that they will
move and persuade stony hearts: But thou ought to remember / that they be
deed voices and lead one to everlasting damnation. But hyder to religion thou
should harken / hither thou should look / hither thou should enclyne thy
mind: endeuoyre thy self with all thy might / employ heron sharply thy wit
/ desceyue not thy self / look to the bottum of the matter / and thou shalt
se / if thou be not blind / how stynkyng / how frustrate or void / ye and
how unworthy for the these things be / that will not suffer the to leave them?

The dispysynge of riches The.iij. Chaptre.
WHat thing of so greatte a valor does this world promise to the / that for
the love thereof thou will put thy soul health in adventure / and absent thy
self from our delectations? What I say does hit promise the? Is it abundance
of riches? For that is it that mortal folks most specially desire: But for
a truth there is nothing more miserable / more vain or disceyuable / more
noyous or hurtefull than worldly goods. The wordly goods are ye very masters
and ministers of all misgouernaunce and mischief. Nor holy scripture does not
with out a cause call covetousness the rote of all yuell. For thereof spryngethe
an ungracious affection unto goods / thereof injuries or wrongs have their
beginning: thereof grows cedition or part taking: thereof comethe stealing
/ pyllynge / sacrylege / extorcyon / and robbynge. Richesse engendre and bring
forth inceste and aduoutry / Richesse nourysheth and fostreth up rauyshementes
/ mad loves / and superfluite. And finally what is it / that the cursed
hunger and desire of gold does not constrain mortal folks to do? Therefore
thou may perceive that Horace was wise / which calling richesse the matter
and rote of all yuelles / commanded to cast them in to the sea: and said: If
it be a wicked deed / it repents me well. For there is so great familyar
societe and frendshyppe of things / that in the very names of vice and
richesse / Vitia et diuitie / seems to be a certain alyaunce and kynrede.
What rich man can thou reke^ unto me / that is not infected with one of
these two vices / either with covetousness (than which nothing is more to be
abhorred) if nature to the same be over much enclyned: or else with
prodygalyte and wast / than which nothing is more abominable / if he that is
inclined thereunto be of benign and gentle nature? The covetous man is
servant and not master unto riches: and the waster will not long be master
thereof. The one is possessed / and does not possess: and the other within a
short while leaves the possession of riches. Me seems that the man called
Eutrapelus / understood those things very goodly / ye which as I have learned
/ was wont to revenge him on his enemy after this manner and form: not with
injurious words / nor with poison / nor with the sword: but he would enryche
his foe with precious garments: for he supposed hit / the which is of truth
/ that should provoke him to desire it / and the hungry desire of riches should
cause him to forget virtue / and drive him to all fylthynes and disworshyp. But
admit that none of all these things shall chance unto the / and yt thou
should have such hap as no man could have: Yet I pray the what goodlines
have these precious weyghtes: the which be gethered and got by great grefe /
and kept with over great thought and care: In heapynge them to gether is
labor intolerable / and in keeping them is over much care and dread: and the
forgoyng or loss of them is a miserable vexation and turment. Therefore a rich
man has no sporting time: for either without rest or sleep he watchethe his
goods that he has got / or else he gapethe to get more / or else he
soroweth for his losses: And as often as he does nothing gain / so often he
weneth that he does lose and has damage. And what if he have and possess
mountayns of gold? Or what and his riches be greatter than mountains of
gold? Than so much the more he augme^teth his fardel and burden / and heapeth
up his cares: and throws or tomblethe fear upon fear / and grefe upon grefe
/ and provides for him self a charge or a busynes of a keeper full of all
myserye and labor. Care does follow the encreasynge of money. And the desire
of the money growethe as the money does increase. And the poorer that a man is
/ ye less he coueteth money. And finally the very custody of greatte goods or
substance / is a miserable or a wretched thing. The man called Uulteius (of
whom Horace speakethe) said / that his advocate or attorney had done ill for
him / when by his wit and diligence / he caused him from pouerte to come to
great riches: and he thought him self to be made a wretch and not a rich
man: and he prayed his attorney that he might be restored to his former life
or state / the which was pouerte. Trewely he is to be preysed / that waxes
wise er hit be to late. But the covetous man says: Though the care of these
riches be grievous and peynfull / money is sweet: My labor and pain does not
weary nor grieve me / so that my riches do encreace. But tell me whether shall I
call the, the most fool or the most wretch of al men? To whom nothing can
suffice / which both night and day syttest watchynge on thy riches / either
hid and locked up in thy iron chestes / or else (to the end thou would
seem to be more wise) doluen in ye earth: like as the serpent Hesperius
watches the golden appulles. For what purpose thynkest thou these richesse and
money should be profitable? Or what preciousnes is in them? For of troth they
be nothing else but very pure brass stricken in images and scryptures: the
which can neither expel or put away the cares and grefes that gnawe the about
the stomach / nor they can not avoid or rydde the of syckenes or any
inco^modyte of thy body / and much less of death. But thou will say / that
richesse be good to withstand need and pouerte. I promise the thou art
disceiued / they will rather cause the to be ever nedy. For like as drink does
not que^che his thyrste that has the dropsye / but makes him more thyrstye:
so like wise with the abundaunce of gods or richesse / thy desire to have
more does encreace: And who so ever seeks after more / shows him self to
be nedye. Now add unto ye trust that thou have in thy goods / the
instabilite or vnassurednes of them, the which thou by so long space of time
/ with so great molestiousnes and labor / by right and wrong / have gethered
to gether al about: if that fortune (as men say) turn her whele / by and by
they forsake and leave the and go to some other. And than thou that wast even
now richer than Cresus that most rich king / shall suddenly come more
powrer than ye beggar Irus. This thing is so clear and manifest / that we need
not to spend many words therein. How many may thou se before thyn eien that
fall from a kings riches to extreme pouerte and nedynes? But admytte that
goods or richesse be sure and stable / and that they will never leave the so
long as thou live, can thou carry them hence away with ye? Yea when thou
go to thy grave / of all thy abundance and riches / thou shalt scarsly have
a course wyndynge shete: other men shall possess all the residue. And if thou
with thy abundante riches have done any good virtuous deeds / they shall
greatly avail and be much worth unto the / nor they will never leave the.
Therefore my sweet Joyce thou should not esteem so hyghly thy possessions /
and al ye gold that Tagus and Pactolus those rivers reuerse and turn in their red sands / that thou should hurt or hindre thine own health: But thou
should rather / if hit delytethe the so greatly to be rich / harken what
counsel our lord gyuethe the: Make thou thy treasure in heaven / where
neither canker nor might can dystroy hit: and where thieves can not find nor
steal hit. Nor think not that there is any plenty morenedy / tha^ to have
abundance of money and want virtues. Nor nothing is more vnwelthy than that
luker or winning that hurts thy soul: Therefore unto the / that art both
erudite and a christen man / it is a foul and a shameful thing with great
peril of thy soul health / to enclyne to that / the which the pagane
philosophers either for the love of good learning / or for their good name and
fame / did set at naught and lightly despice.

Surely they be ladies that most swetely smyle on the / and that with their
fucate or feined fairnes disceiue al most the holle world. But take or rub
away the paintynge and colors: and beware that the craftyly painted fair
skin overcome the not. Behold and look well what these lewd lusts be in
deed, and not what they seem to be. Than shall thou perceive that there is
nothing more ill favored / nothing more fouller, nor more beastlike. For
there is nothing that makes a man more like unto a brute be / than the
most fylthy lust of the fles she does: which thing the more it smylethe or
fawneth on one, the more it noyeth and hurts. Like as the noble phylospher
Plato most aptly calls it the bayte of al yuels. For as the bayte that is
put upon the hoke prouokethe or drawethe the small fysshe thereunto / and takes
them that receive it: even so like wise the poison of carnal lust, covered
with a little quantite of honey / does provoke or allure souls yt be desirous of
a pray: and when they be entyced she enfecteth them: and when they be corrupted
/ she dystroyethe them without mercy. And brefely to speak take heed what the
philosopher says / surely it is a paynyms saying / but it is worthy and may
well be said of a christen man: the which sentence the elder Cato says in
Ciceros book de Senectute / that he learned at Tare^t of Pythagoras scholar
called Acchita / he says: There is no greatter nor more deedly pestilence
given of Nature unto mankind tha^ voluptuousnes / of the which volupte the
feruente lusts are pronely and vnbrydeldlye kendled to fullfyll the desire
thereof. Of this root spryngeth treason and betrayeng of countries: of this
rises turnyng up set down of the commonwealth: the same thing causes pryuey
communications with our enemies. And fynallye there is no myschiefe / nor none
so vengeable a deed / but that the lewd lust of volupte does constrayne one
to enterprise or go in hand therewith. Add also these commodites following to
them before said: Of voluptuousnes comes indige^ce or nedines / infamy or ill
name / grievous and filthy diseases of the body / blyndenes of the mind /
despisynge of divine power / and it is the very fountain and beginning of all
myserye: ye and finally hit is the very cheyne / wherewith mankind is drawn to
everlasting peynes. O sower swetenes, the which is enuyronned or set about
with so manifold miseryes: many go before it / and very many go with hit / and
many many, yea most sharp grievous miseries come or follow after it. I said a
little before that mankind in volupte was like unto brute beastis: but I say
now that in this thing we behave our self worse than beestis. For beasts
take fruicyon of their pleasures (such as they be) frank and freely without
any expense / but o good lord how costly to mankind is that short and foul
smacke of ye delycate throat and bealy. Thou see what thing it is, the
which among bodyly pleasures is most excellent / if any kind of volupte
may be called excellent. Whereto should I now rehearse unto the / the other
triflyng iapes or rather madnesses of ye world? Some call the^ ill joys: but
me think I should not misname them / if I call them mad gaudes. Whereto should I
rehearse the deynty dyshes / the ingurgynges / the drinking and quaftyng one to
an other / the nyghtly dronkennes / the bankettes / the daunces / the gambaudes
/ the dissolute plays / the knauishe and rebaude iestingis / and of the same
sort a thousand things mo? Do not these things seem to ye like the
laughynges of a frantycke man? For who would not judge that man to be clean
beside him self and mad / the which when he is led to be hanged or heeded
/ trembles nothing for dread of the instant execution / but among all the
other that sorrow and bewail his mysfortune / he is ioyfulle and glad / ye
and gothe toward the place where he shall end his life dansynge and meryly
scoffyng and jesting? But those Joyce of whom I spoke now before / I judge to
be more madder than this fellow / in as much as the death of the soul is more
grievous / and more cruel than of the body. They pass forth their life days
in gaudes and sportes / and suddenly they go to hell. Go thou now / forsake
and fall from thy maker to the end that thy beestly and mortal flesh may an
hour or two follow the lust thereof and live damnably / and to the end that
thy flesh may have and enjoy unsteadfast joys / slay and mourther thy soul
and prepare for thy self everlasting pains and waylynges. But parauenture
thou love the veneriall act that is lawefull / and do surely purpose to be
married. For a troth I do not condemn wedlock / for I mind him that says /
It is better to marye than to commytte fornication / but I would this should be
as it were a place of refuge for inconstant folks that can not live chaste. I
have no spyte at them that fled the greatte town of Segor and also the
little / to eschew the fire of Sodomites. I know and perceive well the
strength of thy mind. I allow wedloke, but that is in the^ that can not live
well / except they be married. But look thou and consydre well what saint
Hieronyme has written of these matters: truly he has written very much
thereof. But this one thing I will say unto the / for the great familiarite that
has always ben between us. I admonysshe / ye and heartily pray the to take heed
and beware how thou put thy neck in this haulter: in to the which if thou
be ones entered / thou can not lightly get out again. I do not say that
wedloke is naught / but for a truth it is full of much misery. And as sengle
life is much better / so many and diverse ways it is more vnwelthy or unlucky.

That the honors of this World be vain or foolyshe and unstable. The.v.
Chapter.
BUt paraue^ture the honorable prescriptio^s or titils of noblenes / and the
splendent glory of renown delyten thy mind. Why should hit not? For as he
says / hit is a goodly thing to be honorablye renowned far and wide / and
to rejoice and be glad that a thousand eyes behold the when thou speakeste.
It is a pleasant thing to the to be honorably sought upon and to have many
clyentes or sutours to follow after and go about the, and to be spoken of / of
every man / and to be saluted and greted as a great lord or a master. But I
pray the tell me, what thing do thou suppose that these honors be / the
which unto the being a mortal creature mortal folks give / some for
flatterye / some for fear / and some in hope to win thereby? The which
worldly honors be as clean false as they be caduke and vanishyng. Be they not
false or untrusty thynkest thou / the which indifferently chance as well unto
him that is most worst as unto him yt is most best? Judge and deem thou those
only to be good and very honors, the which flow or grow out of honesty and
virtue. Look that thou enbrace and stick unto virtue / and thou shalt be
honorable whether thou will or no. For as the shadow follows still after the
body / and will not leave hit though he fly / nor can not be taken of one
that recheth for it: so these acts and deeds that be done rightfully / shall
without any seeking of the / bring ye to honors / the which thou being
worthy to have can not avoid: and thou being unworthy can not opteine
them. Is there any thing more slyppry or caduke tha^ worldly honors? Truly me
think yt all worldly things vanishe away lightly and tarry but a while. For
what thing can thou name here that is continually durable. And again
nothing is more uncertain and flitting tha^ great and high dignites: and
seeing that nothing is got and opteyned with more grefe tha^ dignites / for one
must a long season tomble the stone with Sisipho against the craggy mountain
/ and boldly do some thing yt is worthy of banyshynge / prysonement / orels
hangyng / yt at the last he may be some what worhy / and some what exalted:
Therefore I say as nothy^g is got more grievously / so nothing is sooner lost.
Thou ask me why so. Mary because that of necessite greatte hatred or spyre
follows high dignitee / pryuey envy clymbeth up to ye highest in degree: and
the wyndes ouerblowe the high tops of trees and towers. For envy is wont
always to accompany the noble and high enterprises. Thou will say what than?
Mary he that has gotten the hatred of many men / must needs of uery
consequence have many ennemies / and be often in danger of his life. Why so?
Mary for when many go about to have that thing / the which thou alone doste
possess and hold / and all the while thou doste prospere / there is no hope
to opteyne it / hit must needs be / that by some mean they will rydde the out
of the way. Hit were a thing of great difficulte / if that he / for whom so
many snares be laid / should not at the last fall in to one or other of them.
Therefore either thou must dye of poison / orels on a dagger / or else (which
for the should be best of all) thou must save thy self by exile. Or else to
the end that thou might be most fortunate, thou will live in perpetual
anxiete and fear / that thou be not suppressed and cast down. No doubt thou
shalt lead an noble life / but hit shall be very bitter and sower. Therefore
think not the contrary / but that Iuuenal spoke not this ditee that follows
without great skele.

FOr truly the truth groundly to express
who coueteth excessyue honors to attain
And gadreth to gedder excedyngly richesse
Building up to vvres upon to vvres again
Such climmyng up un vvarely, may for a time remain
Yet the higher thou clymmest the sorer is thy fall
So says the satyryan master Iuuenall.
But to what entente do I with so many words rehearse those things? Trewely to
the end that thou my Joyce should understand plainlye / how full of fear
and dread / how full of vexation and trouble / and how caduke and britle those
things be / the which this world / all ye while thou art in prosperyte /
shows to be of great and high exellence. What aueyleth all this / when most
bitter death feirsly assayleth and enuadeth us? When suddenly all the same
images of nobylite / the which after the manner of dreams vanysshe away:
which dreams togeder with the sleep are gone and tarry no longer.

Where ben now the old tyrauntes become? Where is the great Alexandre / whose
covetous mind / all the broad world could not sometime suffyce? Where is the
Persyan king Xerxes / with and of whose houge Navy of ships / all the sea
was covered and redounded? Where is become Hanyball that was so often
vyctorious: the which when he lived / brake the rough rocks and mountayns
with vynegre? Where is now Paulus Aemilius? Where is Julius Caesar? Where is
Pompeius? Where are become all the other most noble princes: of the Greeks / of
the Romans / and of other natyons / whose names to rehearse / should be both
tedyous and time lost? What thing else remains of all their majesty and
glorious acts / but only the vain and frustrate talkyng of folks? ye / and
for the which talkyng / they may thank the favor of learned men: for if
learned men had not written their deeds / they should have been so clean
forgotten / that uneath any remembrance of them would have remained. And yet
what so ever it be that remains / perteyneth neither to them nor to us. For
undoubted / if that Alexandre the most noblest of all ye kings that we have
now rehearsed / should return from Hell and behold the world / and se how
it burns in ambitious desire of worldly honors / I think verily he would
laugh and deryde the vain and folysshe study or fervent industry of the common
people / and he having good experyence in those matters / would say these
words or such like / as follows: Whither does the blind error of mortal
creatures so violently draw and lead the^? No man regards the perfyte good
things / the which may be to them very profitable in time to come / but
things yt be hurtful / vain and uncertain / every man with right great
labor seeks and desires. Why do folk so leudly / so unwisely / and so
obstinatly enbusy them self to be exalted? Every man may learn / at the lest
wise by example of me / that all worldly dignytees soon decay / and be most
like unto clouds, the which often times in an hour space / are wo^t to be very
large and broad / and nothing at all. I my self was sometime the most puissant
and might of all kings and emperors / and was never overcome / but was the
hygest in honor of all men. I subdued and conquered kings and natyons
innumerable: and the world by me was conquered: I serched the sees: and at the
last I attemted the eleme^t: Truly I had been fortunate and happy / if I might
have made death also afraid: But death that ouercometh all things / did
overcome me / yea / with a little fever: There was never bubble blowe^ upon the
water more sooner flasshed nor smoke in the air more suddenly consumed and
gone / than all that great brute of my famous deeds / vanysshed and laid.
Helas how greatly / ye and how suddenly am I changed and turned from that
great Alexandre / to whose commandments all the world sometime fearfully
obeyed? Now I am he that may be both despised and hurt of a poor page / and
can not revenge me. Sometime the great world was less than my covetous mind:
but now I am thrust i^ to a little vessel, and, vij. foot space suffyseth me.
Death only makes a show and a proof of what valor me^nes bodies be. Sometime
I was of great and high estate and right goodly to behold / adorned with
fresshe purple apparayle and a bright shynyng deademe: and now I am most
lothly to look on. Here I lie / dry bare bones and ashes. What aueyleth me my
noble blood and lynage? What aueyleth me my glistring golden tomb? What good
do all these curyous buyldynges of steples unto me / that neither can se nor
feel? But would to god my soul might have dyed with my body: and that after
this bodylye death / a more sharper and a greuousser death should not have
followed. But Helas / the immortal soul is now constrained to suffer pain
for all is yuel living of the body. O / how happy be they that in their life
time may understand these things / the which we have proved / but we
perceive those things now to late? They be wise / they I say be wise / the
which be contented with their fortune and state / and strive to subdue and
overcome them self / and rather to rule themself well than to govern other:
and rather to enbusy them self to get and opteyne the celestial and
perpetual kingdom / than this erthly and unsteadfast empire. He is a mighty
king / what soever he be yt rules him self well.

What thing can be spoken more truly than this oration? and what is he that
this so true and so piteful an oration / would not fear and with draw from
the covetous desire of honors?

Of the necessite of death / the Which suffers nothing to be durable.
The.vi. Chapter.
IUse but to many words / namelye in a thing more clerer than the day light.
For why / this is the course of things now a days / that when the old
histories mention or rehearse any things to be marueyled at / there is no man
welnere, that will give crede^te thereto / when he may se before his face more
greuouser examples than he can read of. But touching death (because I spoke
thereof) I am wont specially to marueyle how this should be / that saying yt
nothing is so much in our sight / as death is / that nothing is more farther
out of our thought and remembrance. Ye and mortal folks are deducted and
drawn out of this vocabull or Word Mors, that is to say death: Wherefore we
can no sooner be named Mortales, that is to say mortal folks / but forth
with our own ears give us warning of death. What an oblyuyon or a
forgetfulness is this? How recheles are folks minds / yea may I not say
how fond and frantycke? Have we no more remembrance? Have we drunk so much
forgetfulness of the river Letheus / that we can not bear those things in
mind / yt which show them self and appear still to us on every side? Be we
as hit were stones astonyed / that these things, the which we both se and
here so often times / can not move nor stere us? Can we se so much as one of
the old world alive? And also we se that cruel death sparethe or forbeareth
no kind of folks in our time. Our fore fathers of old time be deed and gone:
And as Cicero says / They have lived / and without any difference we must go
the same way / and other that be to come shall follow after us. And so all we in
manner of a swyfte river roll in to the Occyan / that is to say we be all
whyrled in to the pytte of death. And as Horace says / One night abides for
us all: And ones we must needs trede the trace of death. The funerals of young
and old are very thycke myngled to geder. And cruel Proserpine forbereth no
man, Innumerable people of young / old, and myddel age, dye here and there / of
our fellows / of our acquayntance / of our kynsfolke, friends / father / mother
/ and children: and we our self that must needs dye / be conuersante a
mydmonges the hepes of them that dye: And al be it that we be borne under ye
same conditions that we must needs dye / yet we fear not death. Thou say /
wherefore do thou command me to think on death / I am yet young and lustye /
I am far from whore hears / and far from an old wrynkeled forheed? They
should live in thought and care for dread of death / that be old and crooked /
and stoupyng to ye earth ward / that have a light shakinge heed / hanging
chekes / small holowe eyes / a continual droppynge nose / a few tethe and
rotten: the which when they have lived as long as a crow / than they reken
their age upon their fyngers. I am far from all these things. Does not my
young blood / that courageth mine heart and spyrytes / my strong arms and
bygge sides / and al my body lusty and in good liking / bydde me to hope after
long life? But I pray the tell me / has god promised to ye either whore
hears or wrinkyls? If thou se no man dye but old folks / than live careless /
and have no mind of death until the time that thou have whore here is and
wrinkyls. But if that death do steal upon folks of every age / if death
strangle them that be not yet borne, not sleyng them / but remouyng them from
life: If death pluck the children away that suck on their mothers breastis:
If death snatche away laddes and gyrles: If death pulle away young men and
mayde^s: If death slay mighty strong men: If death attrappe old men: and
finally if death spares no person of no manner condition / age / strength / nor
beautye / supposeste thou hit will forbear the only above all other? It is
for certain / that an old man can not live long. And thou that art a young
man may sone dye. And look how certain and sure an old man is to dye /
even so uncertain and unsure a young man is to live. There is no man so old
but that he may live one day longer: Nor there is no man so young that can
assure him self to live from morrow till night. And for a truth / if thou
mark it well / thou shalt find that the most part that dye be young
folks. And al be it that whore age has always been scarce / yet was hit never
more scarser / nor more despised than hit is now a days. How many can thou
show me / that have lived (I say not so long as Cython / Nestor / Sibyl / or
Mathusale) but an hundred years? yea how many be there that live.lx. years?
Forsothe scarsly one among a thousand. And how short a time is it? And yet
thou see how few come thereto: so fragyll or bryttyll / so uncertain / and
subject to so manyfolde chances is the life of man. Will thou good Joyce have
of this thing a clear and a commodious similitude or figure? Behold how in
the beginning of the year thou see a tree storysshe / and is so replenysshed
or laden with flowers or blossoms / that the trunk or body thereof can not be
seen / and scarsly the leaves: the which tree seems to bring forth more
plenty of fruit than the tree is able to bear. But yet of all this great
nombre of blossoms very few prove: for some of them be corrupted and distroyed
with worms / some with spyders / and some with wind and wether are beaten
down. And the fruit that remains / when the blossoms be gone / by little and
little wax greatter. And than (I pray ye) do they al ha^ge still till they be
ripe? No truly. Many of them be worm eaten / some the wynd and wether beats
down / some by great storms are corrupted and rotted / and some other by
other mischaunce are distroyed. In so much that at ye last / where thou
hopest to have great abundance of fruit / uneath thou getherest three or four
appulles: Nor man's life does perish with no less inconveniences. There be a
thousand manner of syckenesses / a thousand cha^ces or occasions of death, a
thousand manner of murders / and a thousand sorts of snares / that death
lays for us: through the which mo dye than by auncientnes and time. And
seeing tha^ that our life is subject to so many and great perils: behold I
pray the / how wytlesse and braynesicke we be / that live as though we should
never dye? We be right careful for those thyngis that pertayne nothing to us:
but that thing that should instruct us against death / we care not fore.
What if one king that has mortal war with an another / knew not for
certain how nere his ennemie were / but having knowledge and understanding by
spies / that he should lie in embusheme^t not far of / and when he saw
convenient time / how he would rushe out upon him. Trowest thou that he in this
case would mind the building of bathes / or to prepare a bankette / or to
wedde a wife? But that he would rather imagyn how to augment his army / to
cast a bulwark / to make good watch / and to mind his armor and wepens /
and other things belonging to war / whereby he may defend him from inuasyon
/ and also discomfite his ennemie? And for this will he care fore more
diligently / for as much as he knows not what time / nor on which side the
busshement will break out upon him. But death / our chief enemy / in every
place / and at all times of our age / has laid a thousand manner of
imbushementes to attrappe and disceyue us. And yet in the mean time a gods
name, we stand gaurynge and daryng at riches / we feed and to derely cherysshe
our bodies / and seek for rule and master ship. But and we would at all
times consydre the unsteadfastness and waueryng of this disceitfull life / and
how that death still continually hangethe over us / we should drive in to our
own ears / that that ye prophet said unto the sick king / Dyspose thy house
/ for thou shalt dye: than incontinent all these things / which to our great
hurt seem sauory and sweet / would wax bitter and sower / and those that we
think right precious / would seem vile and little worth: and those that we
repute nobull and gay things / would appear foul and ungoodly. So lyghtely one
thought or inward remembrance of death / persuadeth us to set naught by all
worldly things. O thou covetous man / to what end or intent do thou gether
such abundaunce of gold? Death is at thy back ready to snatche all away. Why
doste you prepare so many great fardelles for so short a journey? Have thou
forgotte what happend to the fool that the gospel speaks of? To whom /
reioisynge that his barnes were full of corn / and promisynge him self many
greatte pleasures / hit was said: Thou fool, this same night thou shall be
slain, and than who shall be master of thy goods? O thou most foolysshe or
unwise fellow / why do thou inclyne or sekest for so mad or unsteadfast
joys / ye with so greatte rebuke or blame? Lo / behold death is even at hand
/ ready to turn these so foul short and leude lusts of the body / in to
everlasting pain and turment. And thou that sekest to bear a rule / to be in
high auctorite / and to reign royally alofte / what an ungracious desire
stereth the thereto? Look, see thou not that death is at thy door / the which
from this high astate will throw the heedlynge to the ground: as it were a
hurl wind / it will bear or carry away both the and all thine? Wherefore
Radulphus Agricola did not only right counnyngely / but also as verytably
or trewlye endyte as follows.

Death ouerthro vveth and dystroyeth all thing
And all that is borne must needs decay
Only virtue shall never have ending
And good acts or deeds shall endure alvvay.
FOr what thing else remains / at the extreme and most grievous point of our
life but only virtue? Than the members languysshe / and the color of the
blood and the life to gether vanyshe away / the visage dies with a deedly
wanne color / the eyes that a little before were so quick and lively of
sight / are than abscured with perpetual darkness: and finally all the holle
body comes cold without any sensyblenes: than the miserable soul / on whom
as one destitute / lies all the weight of the busynes, shall be drawn to that
inexorable place of judgment to make a count and give a rekenyng how and in
what manner it has mynystred all things. What I say shall than remain of all
thy worldly riches / honors / and possessions / the which to get to gether
thou dyddest consume all thy life days? On whom than will thou seek for
succor and help? O miserable wretch / to whom wylt thou go? Whether wylt
thou flee? To thy richesse? Helas they can nothing help the / and though
they could / yet are they than in other men's possession. Will thou go to thy
voluptuous pleasures? These like as they be joined to the body / so they dye
to gether with the body. Will thou flee to thy lusty and valyant young age? Ah
every man's old age is deeth to his youth. Will thou flee to thy comely
shappe and beautye / the which very late made the proud / and entyced every
body to love the? This thing also like as a rose nypte or plucte from the
stalk fades / so to gether by death it wythereth all away. Wytherethe away
quod I / nay I may say hit fades away in to a grysely vglynes. For never none
loved so well the form and shappe of a living creature, as he abhors ye
cors or carkis of one that is deed. Wylt thou run to thy old glory? This
thing also like as I have said vanysheh away utterly wha^ thou dyest. Finally
to whom will thou call and cry for help. Will thou go to the fellowship of
thy friends? Helas some of them / as soon as fortune leaves the / they go
their way / like as swalowes do when summer is goone: and the other / if any
remain still thy friends / can not come to help the. And what can it avail or
help the / if thy miserable friends wayle and knock on their breasts / if
they scratche their visages / if they weeping at thy funeral would shed all
their blood turned into tearis, or if for thy sake they would rounne mad, or
slay them self to bear the company? They may so hurt them self / but they
can not deliver the. Be wise also and consider thy state and condition betymes
/ prepare and have in a redines those things / with which thou being
fortified / thou may careless or without dread abide the last day. Though
riches / pleasure / and noblenes were both certain and profitable / which
thing is far contrary / yet undoubted to one that dies they are a heavy
burden. But than virtue begins to be profitable. And surely if these worldly
things would never leave us / yet must we needs forgo them: but virtue never
forsakes our company, nor to help us.

That the World is both miserable and scelerous. The Seventh chaptre.
THou clearly perceiuest good Joyce / how false or disceiuable / how flittyng
/ and how pestilente the goods of this world be (if they of right may be
called goods) now contrary wise / I will declare to the in few words / the
ylles that come of them. Paraue^ture in time past it was no wonder / though we
were plucked and drawn with peine out of this world / when it flouryshed as
it were in youth: but now except we disceyue our self / in what thing may
the world disceyue us? What ever and as many slaughters / murders, ruins /
and distructions / that chanced or fell on mankind in time past / some at one
time and some at a another / they assail and enuade us in our days all on a
heap at ones / as wars / derthe / scarsyte / penury, barrenness / and many
a strange sickness? Yea what yuell or mischief is it / that we have not seen
i^ our days? I am now.xxiiii. years old / and in all this season the war
never stynted. Hit would seem that Sylla were come again with his partial
part taking / or cedition. And which so ever of the parties does overcome
well I wotte the country is subdued / and gyltlesse does suffer great
affliction. What miserable examples of penury and famyne have we seen? in so
much that many have lived with beasts food / and many have died for very
hunger. And as the world gothe now / a man had need to have the riches of
king Cresus / which yet for all that / he shall with great sparynge and
nigardeshyp scantly find his house hold. And farther: I put the case that
thou thy self doste live welchyly: yet every thing is so full of calamite /
that to here the lamentations / and to se the miseries wherein other creatures
are wretchedlye wrappedde / shall make the miserable. More over / the seeds of
all myschyefes are so sprouted out / that now in our days we pass and far
excede ye iron age / whereof men sange a thousand years ago.

Of sturdy indurate iron the best age framed was,
Than presed in all mischief the world round about
which of a worse metal Nature did compass
For shamefastnes and troth with faith were driven out,
In whose stead came in an ungracious route
Subtyste, falshode, mayntenance and disceyte
Each one to disceyue other that lie in a wait
with covetous that caytyfe to catch that catch may
By robery and extortion their lives for to lead
Each one of other standing in a fraye
The father of his son stands in fear and dread
One brother of an other can scantly trust to speed
In Methamorphoseos ye may read this vvarke
In Iuuenall also, that much noble clarke.
Which says, how the world that we sine i^ now
Is vvors than the iron world that men did so call
For nature could never find the means yet how
That any name of metal might aptly now fall
To call this world by his name which world is worst of al
Worse than iron world, of coper or of brass.
This world is the wretched world that ever was.
For if it were found that a man now a days
Would knowledge the gauge or pledge to him laid
Or deliver again, when the party him prays.
A bag of money, that was to him conuayde
In trust for to keep, and truly again repaide
It might vvelny be enrolde, and vvrytten for a vvonder
That covetous and money could so depart a sonder.
So vvonderfull it were and so prodigious
That it might well be regestred, and ripely enrolde
Of the Tuscans, among their records superstitious

What will thou do in ye world / if thou can not nor have not the cast to
fors were thy self / nor to ymagin fraud and gyle / nor to disceyue thy
neighbor / nor to steal and bribe? But thou say it / what have I to do with
these worldly manners and yuell customs? All my care is only to live trewly
and rightously. If all thy care be to live rightously / look than that thou
get the lightlye out of this world / for the world and virtue will in no
wise agree to gether. Thou myghtest say that I lied / if he that is the very
friend of virtue did not say / that all the world is set on wickedness. Nor
thou should not say smyling to thy self: What so ever other do parteyneth
nothing to me: I care but for mine own self. Truly sweet Joyce / thou art
clean wide and out of the way: for it skylleth greatly with whom thou do
lead thy life / for the diseses of the soul spraule abroad or infect none
otherwise / than the co^tagious maladies of the body do. There is nothing more
perylous tha^ yuell company. Admytte it be so / that thou love virtue above
all things: and will accompany the with an ungracious caytife: How long
shall it be or thou may reduce him to thy manners? Yea / he shall rather (as
we be given and enclyned naturally to ill) corrupt the with his venom / and
enfect the with his scabbed cursednesse / and make the like him in condycion /
and at the last / the common proverb shall be verifyed on you twain / that is
/ Birds of one color fly togeder. But thou say / who shall drive or
compel me to lead my life with an ungracious and a myscheuous fellow? Do
thou ask that question? I tell the thine age and needful business: and
farthermore that ungentle shame fastness: but yet of truth / it is most
part in men of gentle mind and courage: And lastly / the unworthy condycions
of thy fellows. If you be required to go make good chere / or to do or play some
other leude pranke / it boteth or auey leth the not to excuse the by some
business / or else that thou art acrased / for though you swear it on a book /
thou shalt not be believed: and either they will note the for a nygarde or else
for a slouen. What wylt thou do? Parauenture because thou would not be so
noted / thou will follow their mind and entente. When ye come to the tavern
or brothell house / there every man has his wenche. I tell it that is most
honest / I am ashamed to reherce their other filthy deeds: and yet they be not
ashamed to comytte and do them many times and often. Than they begin to strive
and crake who may drink best: And he that can drink most / is the meryest /
the gayest / and the tolyest fellow. Than what is it that dronkennes will not
provoke or cause to be done? Than Pythyas semethe much fayrer. Than Chremes is
far more meryer. And it is both trewely and commonly said: that without
good meats and drynkes / bodyly lust waxes cold. And when they be weary of
drynkyng and bankettynge / than they fall to revelling and daunsynge. Than
whose mind is so well ordered so sad / stable / and constant / that these
wanton daunsynges / the swyngynge of the arms / the sweet sown of the
instruments / and feminie syngynges / would not corrupt / overcome / and
utterly mollify? Ye and farther ye balades that they sing be such / that
they would kendell up the courage of the old and cold Laomedon / and Nestor.
And when the mynstrell does make a sign to stynte / than if thou do not kiss
her / that thou leadyng by the hand dyddest dance with, thou shalt be taken
for a rustical or an vplandyshe vyllayne without any good manners or nurture. Of
the other sportes and plays / the which are more shameful than these / and
invented only for bodylye lust and wantonness / I will not speak. Would to
god they would no more use them. If thou should refuse to do any of these
things / and would assaye to do some thing of more sadues and prudence /
they will esteem and count the unmannerly / cloubbysshe / froward / and clean
contrary to all men's minds. And to the intent that thou would eschew
that blemyshe or blame / O what fylthy acts do thou commit. So thus while
thou would fly and eschew hatred, while thou art ashamed to be reputed
waywarde or froward / while thou art ashamed in deed to seem or be a little
shamefast (as saint Agustyne says) thou do forgette al shame: And wha^
thou art enfected with like scourfe and scabbe / than thou endeuourest thy
self and ghost about to enfecte other. But admytte thou doste not accompany
with no wicked or sinful caytyfe (which were a thing of great marvel) yet
the poison of the malady or sickness is wont not only with touching / that
is so say contactu, whereof the maladies or dyseases be called contagia, but
also with beholding to crepe and enfecte one. For the holle and sound eyes
with beholding or lokyng on sore eyes take hurt. And verily I suppose / that
the eyes be the chief occasion of al lewd entycementes that provoke and stere
us to fylthy sin. Therefore most gentle Joyce as thou desyrest thyn own
welthe / look that thou flee and eschew this scabbed and scuruy company: and
draw unto them / by whose conversation thou may amend thy life.

What felycyte is in solytary life. The Eight Chapter
ALl be hit that I suppose that I have spoken of the foresaid things
sufficiently, yet to the intent that thou should not only with a good will
but also joyfully skyppe from the world and run to religion / that is to say
/ not so much hatynge or agreued with the yls of ye world / as desirous of
our delicious plesures, me think it were not inconvenient to rehearse now in
few words / the commodites of our life, which thing to do, it behooves me
to be brefe, both because I have spent much time labor / and paper, in
straytly dyscussyng of the yuels and calamites of this world, and yet the
greatness thereof requires much more tha^ has been spoken (for in manner no
words or time of communication to discuss it / could suffice) and eke because
me thought thou beganst to wax weary of my babblynge, and also because those
thyngis are more easily perceived tha^ declared. Therefore I would rather yt
thou shuldeste learn them by experience than by my declarynge, and rather to
search them out thy self tha^ to be persuaded. Now sweet Joyce withdraw the
lightly from the troublous busynes of this world and come to us. And than at
last thou shall perceive and se how far the false and disceyuable prosperity
of the world does differ from very felicyte, and how far our labors and
trauayles do pass and excel thy delites. I say thou shalt understand and
perceive it / like as one were waked out of his sleep, the which all the while
he slepeth / supposing that the imaginations and fantasies / that appear to
him in his sleep / be true / he rejoices / he dredeth / he exhalteth him self
/ and is moucd with a thousand affections. But as soon as the sleep is goone /
he than perceyueth / that he was deluded and mocked with imaginations / yea and
he him self laugheth at his dremes: So like wise / when thou shalt clearly
perceive and understand the felicite of our institution or life. O how often
than / when the dreams of thy former life come to thy remembrance / and being
awaked out of that worldly slombre / will thou say? A good lord / was I ever
so far beside my self / that any of these trifyls delyted me? Have such
phantasyes in times passed of false and vain goods so rauyshed my mind and
wit / that no desire of things that be good in deed / could enter in to me?
Therefore now good Ioice / if thou be a sleep / awake / except thou had
leauer be happy in dreamynge than happy in deed. If thou nappe a littell / open
thyn eyes and shake hit of / lest the deep sleep steal upon the. But in case
that thou be awaked / as I suppose thou art / than lest the example of slepers
/ orels the violence of sleep persuade the thereto: hye the as fast as thou
can out of this land of Babylon / full of dreams and shadows: and get ye
apase to our Jerusalem. Why lokest thou behind the? Why staggerest? Why do
thou stay or stand any while? Hit is always hurtful / as Lucan says, to
differ or prolonge these things forth / that be ready prepared. Go to /
break of all delays: for it is not a light or a trifling business / that
thou art in hand with / the matter concerns or touches thy soul: the
which is so worthy and so noble a thing / yt for the welthe thereof thou
ought not only to leave and forsake those thingis / that thou love most
derely / but also wyllyngly to take on the and suffer most hard and grievous
pain and travail. If an excellent and a perfect counnynge phisytion would
say to one that were sick and unlike to escape death: Suffer a little while /
and I will restore the to thy health again: Tell me what rough handlyng /
peynfull touching / grievous throws / would he with right good will endure? He
would suffer his lymmes to be torren and haled with boystous iron instruments
/ to be launced / cut / burned / and a thousand other ways paynefullye
handled / yea he would suffer some peynes / that be more grievous than the very
death / to the end to escape death / and a little while prolonge his wretched
life. O good lord / should any thing seem grievous to ye to suffer / that you
myghtest thereby eschew the death of thy soul / yea death everlasting? If the
chance stood so / that thou must needs those one of these two conditions /
either to suffer thy body to be clean extincted, and utterly distroyed / yt
thy soul might live euerlastyngly: orels by death of thy soul to opteine
life of thy body: I believe thou would not take long aduisement / except thou
were more madder tha^ any frantic man / but that thou would quickly chose
rather the perpetual life of the soul / than the very short life of the
body. And therefore tell me good Joyce / wylt thou not live both blessedly and
perpetually? Hit were great maruayle but thou would / for what is he that
would not? But thou wylt say: By what mean may I opteyne to live always
blessedly? Go to / I pray the, behold what a great thing with a little labor
thou may come by. To opteyne this thing / thou nedest not to fly in the
air with Dedalus wings / nor to travail and pass the dangerous sees / nor
to take on hand the peynefull labors of Hercules / nor to leap in to the
fire / nor no man will co^strayne the / that for this thing thou should hale
and tear thy lymmes / nor slay thy self. Finally / who would say that the
martyrs in old time were peuishe / the which on hope and trust of this
felicite / would not deny or refuse any manner peynes or cruel turme^tes / no,
not the very death to be hard or grievous to them? Take heed I pray the / how
abundantly our benign and lyberall lord has bestowed his gifts upon us /
and again, how easy and light his commandments be. He promised
everlasting felicite to them that have deserved death. What thing can be more
benign or bountiful than this promise? ye and what is more sure and certain?
But now / what does he command the to do? Forsothe nothing / but yt in the
mean time thou should dylige^tly prepare and make thy self redye to receive
so great and so excellent a gift? Thou wylt ask me / by what way this should
be done? No man can receive the very felicite / so long as he is possessed and
holden in captyuyte and thraldom of false felycite. Will thou live
euerlastyngely? Than look that thou live well. Wylt thou enter in to paradise?
Than look that thou forsake this world: for as it is most mischiefull / so it
is most troublous and peynefull. Do thou desire and covet to be joined to
god? Than se that thou endeuoir the to be out of the dyuels snares. Doste thou
love true richesse? Than throw away from the / the false. If thou have
delight in very honors: leave thy seeking for the false. What more? Do thou
love very true beatytude? Look than yt thou forsake these sweet travails /
yea ye laborous swetenes of this world. What thing is more softer or esyer
than these precepts? Who so ever kepethe them / shall have very felicite for
his reward: and the keeping of gods commandments is the beginning of
felycytye. As though he commanded thus: Leave to be wretched / that ye may be
welthye: Leave to be serua^tis, that ye may enjoy liberte. O, what a great
dyfference is between gods co^mandementes and the dyuels? O / how contraryly
they strive and contend to gether? For after the devil has caught us on his
hoke with a little bayte of false delectation? O good lord, into what horror
or vglynes / into what filthynes / and into what myseries does he cast us?
And at length / when he has deluded and mocked us his fyl / he stra^gleth us.
God by very litel and short solicitudes and grefes (the which we suffer not
through any fault of ye things / but through our own fault) leadethe us to
joy incredible / and at length he gives us the bliss of heaven. The dyuels
promotion is disceytefull / his warfare is sower / and his wages (which as the
scripture does witness is death) is most sower of all. Goddis obligation is
faithful and sure: the longer that his war endurethe / the sweter and more
pleasant hit is: and his wagis / which is blessed immortalite / is most
swetest of all. The life of them that follow the devil is wretched / the death
more wretched and after death a life most wretched of all. But to goddis
servants the life is welthy / the death more welthy / and after death follows a
life most welthy and blessed of all. Who would not most gladly / yea and
freely make war under so easy and so liberal a captain / which puttethe
us to so sweet labors? If thou give but little credence to my words / harke^
to him exhorting us / yt can not disceyue (for what leasing can truth
make?) Take my yocke upon you / and ye shall find rest for your souls: for my
yocke is sweet / and my burden light. What joy troweste thou / after their
victory / shall they have / triumphynge in heaven euerlastyngly / with most
high renowned pomp / to whom the labor of the warfare here is so delectable?
How pleasante shall that happy liberty be / if his yocke be sweet to us? I
wot well there be some that will take for a wonder / these words that I have
said: but undoubted they be of that same sort / which most like unto brute
beastis / deem all felicite to rest and be in the taste of the mouth and
pleasure of the bealy. Hit is hard to make such to believe / that the labors
/ where upon the life of religious persons is employed / be neither grievous /
nor heavy or peynfull / but rather pleasant and iocunde. But saying such
fellows will not believe ye very truth / I would they should search and make a
proof thereof them self. And on pain of my life they shall not be disceyued /
so that they do their best / and assaye hit as they ought to do. What if hit
irke or grieve them to make a proof? Than truly I would that they should give
credence to those that have proved religion. For sothe I dare affirm it with
an oath / that every thing in religion is full of pleasure. Nothing is more
plentiful or abundant tha^ our pouerte / nothy^ge is more restfull than our
labor or travail / our abstinence and fasting is right suffisant / our
narowe or strayte rowme / is to us large / wide / and broad / our watchyng is
to us more gladder than any sleep. But and I should swear this upon a book: yet
some would not believe me: Yea they would deem me / joining those so contrary
things to gether / no wyser than he that would go about to prove that the
darkness is light / and the light darkness / that the fire is cold and the
water hot. But what should one say to these beastlye creatures / the which
have no reason / nor they understand no higher than the corporal sensis? Well
/ yet I will not leave them so: They must be allured and drawn with some
argument / very familiar and plain to their understanding / that by those
things / the which unto them be most notable / they may coniecte what these
things be / of the which they have but small knowledge. Let us train them in
to the country / or else if that be grievous unto them / let us go nere home to
the haven / and call to us one of the mariners / which we will / and say: Come
hither good fellow / is not the labor and toylynge that thou haste a
shypbourde very grievous and peynefull to the? No says he / it is a pleasure.
How should that be? For in this manner gettyng of thy lyuy^ge / seems to be mo
and greatter inco^modites than in any other. Hit is treuthe says he. But than
on the the other side / there be many things that greatly encorage and comfort
me. First / what thing is it / that sweet luker or winning does not make
pleasant? Nothing is more plentiful or rycher than the sea. There be many
alive at this day / which were very poor / and now by trauaylyng and
turmoylynge on the sea only / they be excedynglye rich. Who can tell whether
hit shall be my chance like wise or no? Farther, the customance and continual
use thereof / eases a great part of my grefe: the which continual custom in
things is without doubt of so great effect / that nothing is so grievous or
paynfull to be done / but that the often doing thereof makes it either
pleasante / or at the least light and easy, And lastly / there be certain
things / the which do mitigate and make us to forget the pain of our labor
and toylynge / as singing / talking / propre sportis / and a thousand other
such like things. Ye have hard this I thy^ke playnelye inoughe. Now if we
should go from warkehouse to warkhouse / I trow every man would answer and
say to us the same / or very like words. What follows tha^? Truly if
uncertain hope for so small and vile luker / makes so grievous labor and
toylyng pleasant to these laborers and workmen: Why should not ye most
certain and sure abiding for everlasting felicite, cause and work the same
in us? If contynuall use and customance be of so great effect / and may do so
much among them / for what cause should hit not do like wise in religion? If
they have ways / with the which they alleuiate and ease their incommodites
and grefes: no doubt we have many mo and better to mitigate our tribulations
and peynes.

How that far greatter liberte is in religion than in the world. The.ix.
Chaptre.
BRefely to speak / these.iii. things be in religion / Liberty / Tranquillite
and pleasure. Of Liberty (whereof I will first entreat) all we be most
desirous / every man aborreth seruage and thraldom: in so much that many have
kilde them self for very hate thereof, which esteemed lybertye better than life
/ and death better tha^ seruage. wherefore if folks delight so much in liberty
/ that to bye false liberty cost them so derelye / how gladly ought they to
enbrace and desire the institution of our life / as it wherein is perfect and
true liberty? But here some ignorant fellow will say to me: If liberty
(after Ciceros diffinition) be to live as you will thy self / I can not se
how you religious men should have any liberty at al: for ye like birds
shut in a cage dare adventure to do nothing / neither to eat nor speak / to
sleep nor wake / to go nor come / nor so much as ones to yane / without the
abotte or superior command you. I pray you do such folks live at their
liberty? No certaynely / no more than horses or asses be at their liberty /
the which are brydled and prycked with the spurtes / to go here and there /
where so ever the ryder will have them. But all this argument is sone dasshed.
For we will nothing but that that is leful: and therefore it is lefull for us to
do what so ever we will. But touching our lybertye / I will speak more
afterward. Now give me leave to question again with the a little. Tell me /
art thou not ashamed, to say thou art at thy liberty in the world / wha^
thou have mo masters than thou can nombre in a day? First / thou must
attend and apply thy mind about the worldly busynesses / to the which who so
ever ones gives him self / they are wont to wrappe and with such cheynes to
lynke him in / that whither or which way so ever they draw / he must needs
follow after. What and thou have a wife / yea thou must needs be had / for
wedlock is a thing reciprocate? Take heed / there be an other peyre of
fetters. For truly by that / there grows to the an other grievous seruage /
and out of hit thou canste not lightly get. Farther, what and thou be a
wicked and a sinful liver? O good lord / in to what a bondage and thraldom
art thou than ironne? Now look how many vices thou haste / and to so many
masters thou must obey / yea such masters as are most terrible / abominable
/ and cruel. For who would deem that man to be at his liberty / the which
can nothing disobey his bodily lust / but what so ever it commands / yea
though it be most fylthy / as hit is always / and most hard or peinefull / as
it is often / yet he must needs obey? Thine eyes desire sleep / and feign thou
would sleep: but to the entente that thou should not / thy right stately
maistres fleshly lust lettethe the / she byddeth the to rave in the night /
and to run about / to visette thy paramour / and in a foul stynkynge
brothell house among hoores and drabbes to pass forth the night without
sleep. And there thou must be glad to please a stynkynge harlotte: if she
command the to do any thing / thou must do it: if she forbydde the to do
any thing / thou must like wise obey: if she bydde the go thy way / thou
must depart: if she bydde the come / thou must return. Do not think this a
thraldom or bondage most shameful? What liberty has a covetous man? he
would feign live at home / and so sluggardie byddeth him. But may he do so
continually? will his maistres covetousness suffer that? what says she? Lyueste
thou thus in sleuthe? why sittyst thou still? See not what great winning
thou myghtest have / if thou would pass ye see with marcha^dise in to France
/ Flanders / and other places? Come of / make the ready / thou must needs take
shyppyng. Lo / thou have wind at will. And thus to fullfyl thy maistres
bidding / thou trauaylest by see and land: yea all the winter long / and
have no care for the tempests / nor for thy wife / nor for thy children / no
nor for thyn own life. Doste thou reken thy self this wise to live at
liberty? And in reasonynge a like proof may be made of every other vice: but
because me think this talking waxes tedious to the / I will pass over and
speak of other things: but first I will show the in general / that no man
being wicked and sinful can be at his liberty. Were thou never ashamed and
sorry for thy fylthy life? Yes I believe many a time. For who is so far paste
all grace / that never reme^breth how he has lived? and wha^ he sees how he
is defiled / either for fear of punishment / or for the love of virtue / he
has an entente or purpose to amend his life. Thou say / it is so in very
deed / and I strive with my self other while to forgo my most wicked manners:
but when I am about it, ye would not believe with what force and violence
custom in sin stops me / yea and whether I will or no / hit drives me to
mine old affections. Thou sayste well and truly. What than? Do thou not
perceive wretch in to what greatte captivity thou art brought? Do not now
understand, that thou art servant unto vices? For when they perceive that
thou art about to leave them, and to run away / they lay hands upon the /
and as a servaunt fast fettred / they throw the in to the back house. Back
house was a place in old time where rennagate servants were sore punysshed.
Go to now mad fellow, and bost to us thy liberte that art servante to the
world, to thy wife, to Fortune, to carnal lust, to covetousness, to ambition,
ye and to the dyuell, in so much that thou may well say with the married man
in Tere^ce called Syrus (save only yt in him hit is feyned / and thou may
say it matter in deed) I desire and would feign know, how many masters I have.
And truly, as our country man Hegius writes, To be servant unto many
Is a state of greatte mysery.


Whereto should I now remember to the our liberty or fredome? Does it not seem
a great liberty to live out of fortunes dominion? if there be any fortune /
and neither to dread her cruelty, nor to desire her favor / nor nothing
grieved with her adverse frowardnes / nor nothing the more insole^t or stately
for her luckynes. We dare as boldly despise her as Democritus did / ye and in
derisyon make a pot at her. She has no power over us. We have to gether with
worldly riches, thrown away from us the desire of the same riches: yea we have
with god playde the usurers. What and fortune slay us? Yet we surely know / yt
no grievous thing can chance unto us save only filthy sin. They be afraid of
death, the which live ill and synfully. But certainly good and virtuous people
do not only live out of the dread of death / but also they desire death / as
the thing that should from hence deducte and lead them to a more welthy and
blessed life. Farthermore we have all to broken the iron yea the cheyne as
hard as the adamante stone / of worldly busynes: And thus we being lyghted
and delivered of that most grievous fardell or burden / and lyftyng up our
minds to heaven / what so ever is done beneth a low, we deem our self to have
nothing to do therewith. Wherefore I pray the / what thing ca^ be more free or
more at liberty? Farthermore we have by the help of god / shoken of our
necks the most hard or heavy yocke of terrible Pharao. We have given over and
left to serve most shameful and reproved lords / I mean vices / but not in
such wise / that we should never at no time commit sin or offend / I
wotte not whether any mortal creature may do so in this life or no. But as a
valiant warrior / that opteyneth great laud and preyse / and the name of a
conqueror / entrethe boldly in to battle / and manly feyghteth hand to hand
with his ennemy / and there receives many a grievous wound / but yet he either
takes or sleeth his ennemie: And on ye other side / he that is taken / though
he have never a wound / no not so much as his skin broken / yet he is
iugged to be vanquished and over come / and must suffer him self to be led
away as a prisoner in to captivity: So like wise if it happen us to slide /
for as I have said / almoost no man can keep him self always from sin: yet
we be sure to overcome / we be sure of our liberty, and we be in certaynte of
our life. What does hit sygnifie that they, the which bear them self manly
in battle are wont to uncover their breast is / to show the scarres of their
wou^des? Or why return they in to the city or lodgings with the spears /
darts / and arowes styckynge still in their bodies / like as they were by
chance stryke^ and wounded in battle? Certeynly to the end yt al folk should
se and understand / that they reken it most high worship / in the defense of
them self / and the wealth of their country / to resceiue most large and
grievous wounds. Yea truly they would rather (wounded unto death) be carried in
to their tents or lodgings with victory / than holle and sound (if they so
could) to come under the subjection of their e^nemie. Who so ever submits
him to vice and sin / he is in great thraldom and a very bond man to an
enemy. But to what enemy? To an enemy most fylthy / most cruel / and
most mortal / the which will be more glad and feign of our death / than of
his own life. What a shameful thing is hit for man / and what an unworthy
thing to man's worthiness / to endure or suffer / that the foul stynky^ge
devil should be his lord and master / and let naught by him / to whom he
is bound both for him self and all that ever he has? Specially since to serve
him (I say almighty god) is most high liberty / yea there is no liberty but
that. Wherefore if there be any / that begins to wax weary of that servile
and bondly liberty, and would gladly come to this free and most liberal
service: he must I say seek it in religion. For as I have said / liberty is
to serve god only / ye which can be served no where better tha^ in solitary
and places of religion: for there is no where else so much liberty.

How they that live a solitary life enjoy a double quyetnes. The Tenth Chap.
BUt what is he that could worthily descryue tranquyllyte or quyete? The
unrestful rorynge of the world does not russhe in here among us in religion.
What thing is there abroad in the world / that is not full of bellynge /
cryenge / hurlynge and burlynge / and business? One wepeth / an other laugheth
/ he lamentethe / he stryueth / he greteth / he tells news / one calls
forward / an other commands to come back / he is gone / he comethe / one
cries and calls out a loud / an other ronneth to and fro / yea which way
so ever thou look / where so ever thou become / thou shalt find nothing in
quiet / but thou shalt find every thing full of noise and dynne / in such
wise / that it shall seem to the that thou art all to tossed among the ragynge
wawes of the sea / when it is most troublous. When shall thou have time among
these things to set thy mind at rest and quiet? What is he / that in so
varyable a state of things can stand constantly and live out of trouble? What
thing in this whyrle wind may the divine mind of man either think or do /
that is worthy and besemeth him to do? How is it possible that ye soul / now
made deffe with continual and insatiable rorynge and yellyng / may here her
spouse knocking at the gates of her breast / and his voice speaking to her?
For a treuthe / Helyas perceived not that our lord god was with him / in the
cite or town / but in the mountain / not in the court / but in the cave / not
in the whyrle wind that all to brekethe the stones / not in disturbance / no
nor in the fire / but in the whissinge of the thynne and light air. If thou
had time to over read the holy historyes / thou should se and perceive /
that the greattest miracles of divine things were showed and done in solitary
places / and not where great resort and company were gethered. For where was
that secret and wondrous mystery of the burning boushe that flamed up / and
peryshed nothing / showed to Moses? Was it in the cities of Egypt? No
trewelye. (for than he was fled thence for dread of the tyran Pharao) but it
was done in the hylle of god / after he had entered in to the great, large, and
high wodde. Nor the celestial food Manna, was not sent to them that did
inhabit great and noble palaices / but unto them that dwelled in the
flouryshynge wilderness. Where was the divine pomp and triumph celebrate in
gyuyng of the law / wha^ the celestial trumpettes gave a terrible sownde, now
and than thondryng and lightnynge with swyfte flame / flusshynge out of the
dark and thycke clouds? For a truth this was done upon the hylle top of
Synai / all the common people being commanded to stand a side. And it is
left in writynge / that in old time the prophettis chylderen / the which in
time to come should be prophettis them self, would for hatred of the rich
edefices and sumptuous buyldynges / go dwell upon the river side of Jordan.
John^ being more than man / as he that was called the angel of our lord / I
pray the where led he his heavenly and most pure life? Where was he taught
the divine secrets / that he doubted not to point god with his finger / that
was in likeness of a man? Certainly he did not learn it at home with his father
/ but in the wyldernes. And what means it, that many times we se our lord
Jesus him self / as though he were weary of company / depart aside into
solitarye places? How often is it read that he taught in the mountains? And
what miracles showed he in desarte places / and upon the sea coost / both in
healynge of syckenesses / and in correctynge of the vices both of body and
soul / in expulsynge and casting out of wicked spirits, and in feadynge of
so great multitudes of people with so little quantite of meat. What time he
would fast, he clean absented him self / and was in desarte places out of
the sight of all folks. In a mountain that most gracious visyon was showed
to his three apostels. In the twylyght of that night, in the which Christ
suffered him self to be taken / to the intent he would pray / he departed and
went in to the orchardes. It is he the which also byddeth us when we woll
pray, to hyde us in the secret parts of our chamber. And finally / it was not
causeless / but for great skele / that he was slain with out the city: so
that thou may lightly perceive that he fled busklyng busynes, that he hated
the clamorous assystens of people / that he loved not the crackelynge and dynne
of the courts, and that he delyted not in the getheryng and frequence of
people / but he ioyed to be alone / and loved very much tranquillite. Whereto
should I now reherce the examples of man, the which be of less auctorite?
Men say that Pythagoras was taught many secret things in the cave called
Ideus. Plato demed his schole of phylosophye much more commodious to be kept
at Achadamie than within the city of Athens. The poets them self feyned how
they had I wotte not what clyues and dark woddis / where they wo^ned or abode,
as often as the divine furour took them: whereby they sygnifie / that he that
desires to endite or make any noble and goodly ditee / he must separate him
self from company. Farthermore to speak of the vulgar people / we se yt gold
smythes / peynters / and other artificers / in whose workemanshyppe is any
thing of singular industry and great conning / when they covet to make any
thing more exactly and with greatter diligence / they get them to some place /
where the noise and coming and going of folks shall not trouble them in
their works. By all which things / hie is plain and evident to perceive /
that much company annoyeth and greueth him right much: the which entendeth
or gothe about to do any thing of great weygth and difficulty. And quiet is
right oportune and very necessary for him that will enterprise or go in hand
with high and weightye matters. And what is a more higher and a more serious
busynes than it that concerns thy soul health, and blessed living? Therefore
while thou abydest in the world / thou can not co^modiously atcheue this
business. For in what place of the world shall thou find quiet? But
contrary wise good Joyce / here in religion / all things be whishte or in
silence / within / without / and every where is perfect peace. The pleasant
recesse or solytarynes of the place / is the cause of silence: and peace
proceeds or comethe of a very good and a close mind: And so much the tone
needs ye tothers help, that if thou take away the tone, thou would think
that neither of both remained: For the outward quiet does cheryshe / noryshe
/ and defend the inward peace: And again the outward quiet without the
inward / would be grievous / ydell / ye and very hurtful. And only him that
has his mind grievously vexed and troubled / the poet forbyddeth to be alone /
saying / what ever thou do hurtful are placis alone
Bevvare of sole placis when thou do moan
vvhither vvoldest thou than flee or starte aside:
Among company thou may more surely bide.


NOr I may not here well ouerpasse (all though I entende to be brefe / for
hit comes so well to purpose) that same noble exhortation of the philosopher
Crates / the which on a time / as he beheld and marked a young man / that
wandered all alone hither and thither / musing and imagining very profoundly
upon some thing: asked him what he did there? The young man answered: I talk
with my self. Take heed quod Crates / yt thou talk not with a lewd or a
naughtye fellow. Each of them answered meryly and quickly. Therefore
solitarynes in a person of laudable and good living is commendable: and
contrary wise to wicked and mischeuous lyuers / nothy^ge is more perilous. For
than these mischeuous caytyues think on mischief / than they conceive in
their minds most cruel deeds / and than they treat and reuolue unhappy
counsayles both for them self and other. Yea and what should stere miserable
wretches / to haste to slay them self: if opportunity of solitariness did not
provoke them thereto? Who is he that ever dra^ke poison / that hanged him self
/ that styckte him self / that brake his neck / except he were alone? Thou
sayste to me: wherefore than do thou commend to me so much solitarines / a
thing so perrillous? Here have I nothing to answer more conuenientlye than
the saying of Crates before remembered: When thou lyueste by thy self alone /
beware that thou live not with a lewd or a wicked fellow / and tha^ thou
nedeste not to dread any thing in solitarines. So depart away from company /
that thou may be much farther of from vices: and look that the places about
the be so in silence / that thy courage and mind gronte nor groudge not. And
all be it that I am long in this matter, yet my mind is not to commend unto
the / the solytarines of Timon / I would not that thou should separate thy
self from all mankind / as he did / but I would thou should leave unruly
company. And as touching the outward quiet I have spoken sufficiently. Now
I will brefelye entreat of the inward peace / the which like as it rests
or consysteth in the mind / so it proceeds or comes from a good and a pure
mind from vice. For virtue is of such strength or effect / that it quieteth
or sets at rest the mind or courage / wherein hit remains / with an
incredible peasablenesse / ye and it expels or auoydeth all pensiveness /
horror / dread / and perturbation. What a thing virtue is / thou shalt
better understand / if thou list to be hold / what grefes / what troubles /
and what vexations a wicked mind endures. For he that is a thief / a
disceiuer of the people / a hoore monger / a traitor / a rauisher of women /
an aduoutrer / or other wise a mischeuous caytife / his conscience for the
wicked deeds does oppress him so / that he is all to tossed and tombled with
perpetual care and dread. The very shappe or form of his wicked and
mischeuous deeds / like as hit were the horrible furies of Hell / run upon
him / they fiersly assail and enuade him both slepyng and waking. At every
thing he waxes pale / he is afraid of every busshe / but namely he dredeth
suspection / whisterynge / infamy / judgment / and punisheme^t. But admit,
that he sets naught by all these things / and can disceyue the conscience
of men / and that he dredeth not al mighty god: yet wha^ shall he bring it so
to pass / that he may escape ye smarte prickynges or grudgy^ges of his own
conscience? That shall he never do. For what so ever thing he would do / or
whyther so ever he would flee / the same cruel turme^tis / shut with in his
breaste / will not leave him / they appear still before him / they toss and
turmoyle him / they make him afraid / nor they will not suffer his meat / the
light of the day / no nor his life to be joyous to him / ye and lastly they
make his very natural rest or sleep unquiet to him. Hereof very often times
comes leanes of the body: this causes vggly and fierce cou^tinance / of this
comes the fylthynes of the eyes: and hereof ryseth fear of every thing: whereby
they be wo^te to discover and bewraye them self: the which thing is right
well and justly ordained of god that most ryghtous judge / to thentent that no
man should commit an iuell deed / and be utterly unpunished: For
suspeciousnes is wont forthwith to follow foul and ill deeds / the which
first of al does greatly punish the misdoer / and there upon talkynges and
infamy does follow / the which undoubted many judge for so great a mischief /
that they had leauer dye tha^ live and endure them. But some be drowned so deep
in sin / that they set naught by such things. Admit hit be as the common
saying is / that as much as their wyckednes is / so much is their fortune /
and that no man accuses them / nor no judge medleth with them: yet I say there
shall be one in time to come / the which will sore and rigorously punyshe them.
Yea but those things be far of say they / as though they were sure and
certain / to live yt space of one hour. But admit it be as they do say /
yet for all that even now while they be alive / they be inwardelye turmented
and punyshed with their conscience / the which prycketh so sharply and so
bytterly / that there is no wicked deed can cause so great pleasure / that hit
should be boughte with such turmentis. Who could ever sufficientlye deem /
how cruel the disturbance of the breast is / wha^ the self mind with a
sharp sedition stryuethe with it self / and some partis thereof inclinynge
some way / is stricken / haled / plucked / torren / and rent / the memory
accuses / reason iuggeth / and conscience punysheth. Reason calls one way /
and nature an other way / and the pleasure of sin an other way: whereof are
engendered perpetual pryckynges / perpetual braulynges / and perpetual war.
Wherefore it is thought that certain doctors of the church have said very
well / the which iugged / that the Remorce of conscience / that acco^panieth
and gothe with the sinners unto hell / was not the leest part of the
punisheme^tis / that they suffer there. The which things Iuuenall right
ornatly (as he does every thing) descryueth as follows: Than what is the
cause tell me now why
That thou supposest, how thou have escaped vvele
The troublous motions of thy mind inwardly
By grouge of thy conscience that the does appele
And fore the accuses, and cruelly does dele.
In thy secret thoughts of pryuey pensyuenesse
Scourgynge the with scourges of boteles bytternes
Remorse of conscience is of such vehemens
That it is the pain most peynefull of all pains
So savage, so ragynge, so sovvre of experience
So doggedly gnavvynge, so troublynge man's brains
That where so Remors of conscience remaynes
Ceditius that judge, nor Radamant judge of Hell
Did never such punishment with peynes half so fell
For who so is vexed of conscience with remors
Slepynge or vvakynge by day and by night
Out of his heart no chance can it deuorse
This penytent penance perpetually does fight
Eating or drynsrynge it is ever in thy syghte
Thy throat so with thought it does both stop and freate
That sca^tly you can eat, nor swalowe down thy meat.


And so forth most eloquently and truly he proceeds. And like wise as the
same things be proved by reason and auctorite / even so thereof may be showed a
thousand examples: but because we will not tarry long in rehersyng of many /
three shall suffice us now: of the which the first shall be taken out of fables
/ the second out of the Romayn histories / and the third out of holy
scripture. What other thing does it signify / after Orestes had slain his
mother / he was taken with spirits (which commonly are called furies) and was
so sore vexed with them / that whither so ever he fled / he always met them
shouynge fire brondes against him: than that he / the which co^mytteth any
mischeuous deed is turmented and vexed with the remors of conscience / as
though he were taken with a fransie? Certainly many things have been right
counnyngly invented of the poetis / but after mine opinion / none more apt or
feter than this. And therefore it repents me not to rehearse this fable here.
And what thing is more evident than the example of Lucius Sylla? This man as I
read. was cruel out of all measure: so that hit is a thing right miserable
to tell how many he banished / or commanded to be slain: and also he was not
a little garnyshed or decked with other vices. But of this tyran / the very
self malice that was in him / took vengeance / the which no man else could do.
For he was so turmented and vexed with the conscience of his ill and wicked
deeds / that by no wit nor help of phisytyons he could not recover again
his sleep / that he had lost: and so at the last he dyed of the most fylthy
disease called the lowsy yuell. The old and manifest example of Cain does yet
remain. We read that he being moved with envy / slew his brother / but he
did it not unpunished. For he was punyshed forth with / and that diversely / but
no way more cruelly / nor more mortaliye / than of conscience. The remorce of
conscience for his wicked deed was to him more grievous / than any other
punishment that god his creator took. Our lord god rebuked him yea he rather
reclaymed him / to cause him to take repentance and to confess his offense:
but he ye wretched caytyue esteemed his sin greatter than could be forgyuen.
God granted him his life, but he iuged him self unworthy to live. What a
vengeable turmentour think ye thus cruelly vexed his stomach? What sweet or
pleasant thing suppose ye could chance him in his life / the which being
sore grieved with him self / and dispeirynge of him self / as one all heavy and
pensive demynge his life to him bitter and sower / he dredde and was ashamed to
come abroad in the sight of folks? For he went that all other had been such
to him as he was him self. Thus ye se good Joyce / what turmentes / what
defilinges / what grudgingis / what troubles / and what braydes a wicked and a
sinful mind endurethe. Now take heed and mark / how restfull / how
peasible / and how pleasant a thing it is to have a clear and an vncombred
conscience / and for no gylte to wax pale? What thing is it yt can disturb
or trouble his mind that is well settled and ordered? What thing of right ought
he to dread? Should he be a gast of any man? Certaynely he nedethe not to dread
though man be his ennemy / that is holly bente on god his friend. Shall
calamitees and miseries make him afraid? No truly. For he rekeneth them to
be his wynnynges. But shall he live in dread of death / the which also he
gladly desires and wissheth fore? Finally / shall he not fear god him self?
No truly. For he hops and surely trusts / that he is in gods favor and
keeping. What can be thought more restfull quiet / more vncarefull or more
happy / tha^ this thing? Joyce / one may feel or perceive it / but plainly it
will not be declared. Parauenture / thou art so blessed or happy / that thou
haste already living in the world / the self same thing that I call the unto.
And I verylye trust that thou have. But my mind is / that so much the rather
thou should fly and leave the world. For here in religion / thou shalt
find and have hit more heapingly / and far more surer. What thing makes
the so careless / that thou will bear so dear a treasure among thieves? If
thou have ought / it shall encreace here in religion / but in the world is
continual fear / lest thou forgo it: Here most specially is the ilke inward
peace: and except the outward quiet be here / it is no where. In the world
is no inward peace / and as for outward peace / if there be any / it is very
scante / and not very sure. And this is certain / that ye religious houses
reduce ye ill men to goodness / and they that be good hit makes better: But
contrary wise / the world is wont to make good men ill / and ill men worse.

Of the pleasure that is in solitary life. The.xi. Chap.
IN discriuynge of tranquillite or quiet, I have been more brefe than ye thing
required / and yet therein I was more prolixe than I thought to have been: Now I
will as shortly as may be / declare or entreat of pleasure / the which thing
only remains vndeclared. Undoubted all folks are so obstinately inclined to
pleasure / that for no manner yuels they can be feared from it / nor no reason
can withdraw them from hit? And parauenture hit is not without great skele ye
Epicure says / mortal creatures in ye judgment of pleasures do err much:
but yet all creatures by one assente / some by one mean and some by an other /
seek for pleasures. So that for this cause most specially secular or worldly
folks are wont / both to fly and hate the institution of our life: the
which they repute to be hard / strayte / grievous / peynefull / and clean
without pleasure. But to the end that this error should not abashe or make
them agaste / I shall plainly declare / that it is far other wise. Yea our
life is so much without pleasure / that I durst entyce to us all the delicate
Sardanapals / as to a paradise of all delites and pleasures. Thou wylt obiecte
and say: yea faith / pleasure is in monastaries / like as the delphin is taken
in the woddes / and the wild bore hunted in the sea. I assure the good Joyce /
that all the manner of our life is pleasant. Thou askeste me how that should
be: and I shall show ye how. Epicure denies those things to be pleasures /
the which be cause of gretter greffes. We keep no drabbes / nor live not in
aduoutry: nor we feed not / nor ingurge not our self / like as the wanton
prodigal fellows are wont to do: we be sobre at the son going down / and
sobre when the son ryseth / the which thing they can not say. For those
things are never in so good plyte / but they be cause of more grefe than
delight. Nor we neither can nor covet to be enryched: nor to be ennobled by any
high magystrate or rowme. Nor in these things we omytte not ye maystership of
Epicure. For seeing that they cause littel pleasure and much grefe, me seems
we do wisely, in that that we will not bye a small commodite with a greatter
inconvenience. More over Epicure teaches / that other while sorrows must be
ventred on / or taken well in worth / to the end that greatter and more
greuouser dolours may be fled and eschewed. And like wise often times we must
forbear small pleasures, to the end that we may obtain greatter. What speak
ye of us? We religious men suffer and gladly endure watchynge / fasting /
solitariness / silence / and such like things / to the end that we would not
sustain greatter sorrows. We be not dasshed full of sweet savors / we sytte
not bollynge and drinking all the day / we dance nor revel not / we loyter
not about / whither so ever fond lust calls us / nor we set not our fantasy
on such like folishe toys: but would to god thou coudeste se and behold with
wath great auantage we want those things. Had thou thought yt we had for
gone pleasure? Nay we have not so done / but we have made a change / yea in
such a wise / that for a few and small pleasures / we have received many great
pleasures. Me thought now welyore / that these / picked / delicate fellows
gave an ear / on trust that I would show some new inue^tion of pleasure: and
for certain so I will. But in ye mean time I would they should withdraw their
minds from foul stynkynge and unlawful pleasures / ye which they use with
beastis in commune. I would they should for sake their beastilynes / and
understand / that in man is some what more higher and more divine, where unto
their delectation should be rather applied than unto the body. For seeing that
in beastis there is nothing more noble than the body / hit is not vnskelfull /
that their felicite rests in fillynge of their bealies and in bodily lust.
But the condition or state of man is more worthy / than that he should esteem
him self to be borne for none other cause than beastis be. For man is not
only made and co^pacte of the body but also of the soul. In body / save only
in shappe / we differ nothing from beastis: but in the soul we resemble
very much the divine and eternal nature. The body is a thing erthye / beastly
/ slow / mortal / syckely / caduke / vncrafty / and unnoble: Contrary wise /
the soul is a thing heavenly / divine / immortal / perpetual / pure / and
noble. Therefore as much as the body is lower and under the soul in dignite /
so much more the pleasure of the soul should excelle the wanton and lewd
lusts of the body. For that pleasure / like the soul it self / is perpetual
/ never lothesome / pure / honest / divine / and helthfull. Contrary wise /
the bodily pleasures / are disceiuable / soon vanyshynge / loathsome more sower
than sweet / foul / and deedly. But it is impossible to enjoy the pleasure of
the body and of the soul both at ones. The one must needs be forgone. What
would Epicure say to this / if one asked him counsel? Forsothe that we
should expelle and put away from us those filthy and foul lusts of the body
/ that they let us not to opteyne / the sweet and most excellent pleasures of
the soul. The which thing (as I have said) is not away to lose / but
greatly to win pleasures. But me think thou lokest that I should tell / with
what pleasures of ye soul we be fed here. First as Epicure says / whose
authorite I will not yet forgo, to want the horrible vexation and grudge of an
unclean conscience / is the greattest pleasure that can be. For he has not a
little to rejoice of / that has nothing to be sorry fore. Farther / is not
the co^templation of heavenly and immortal delectations / unto the which we
hope ones by goddis grace to come / a thing of great pleasure. Who is so
blonte of understanding / that when he being weary of this life / does
remember the felicity celestyall / will not weep for very joy? Whose mind is
so agreued and oppressed with heaviness and sorrow / the which when he
remembers the life to come / does not rise up / and waxes very gladsome / yea
and would feign be out of this world? What and one might taste and sauoure
these things? For all be it that they / to whom the world is as yet sauory /
can find no savor or swetenes in them / yet unto holy and well dysposed
minds there is nothing more surely approved. And though that the great joy
and pleasure of the life that is reserved in time to come / can not be
perceived / be fore the soul depertynge out of this ill fylthy / and vnswete
prison of the body / resort thither again / from whence it came: yet never
the less / me semethe that good devout minds have a smacke and some
perceiving thereof / and are weate as hit were with a dew of heuenlye showers:
and of that same light that never shall fail / they se as it were a glymeryng
or a gla^ce. The which thing how great a pleasure it is, it can not be
persuaded unto him that is ignorant and vnexperte thereof: but unto them that be
expert therein / it can not be esteemed nor spoken how pleasante it is. And all
though (as saint Bernarde says) these delytes are but outher while / and are
wont to tarry but a short space: yet are they so great / that if all the
pleasures of this world were laid to gether on a heap / in regard of these
they would seem little worth / yea and not to be set by. And if there were no
other rewards / for good deeds to be hoped fore (which thing is far other
wise) yet forsothe hit would never grieve me / for this only hyre or mede to
suffer and endure all manner labors / and would deem them so worthy / that to
the^tent to opteyne them / I would not only despice and set naught by all
other lustis and delites of this world / but also bydde them battle. Go to
tha^ / what mow we suppose and think that the great plenty or abundance of
these joys would do / if a littell smacke or a very thynne savor of them so
much deliteth / so recreateth / and makes one so joyful? O / how great a
pleasure shall it be / when that divine light shall shine over and over us,
the which can not be seen but with most purified eyes: so that we also shall
all shine bright: saying that a lyttel glymeryng or a gla^ce thereof / the
which quickly comes and vanishes / causes so great pleasure? Farthermore /
yt swetenes / that the holy ghost many times secretly entering in to the clean
and pure minds causes / how ofre in the most chaste chamber he enbraceth
and clyppeth his spouse / languishynge in his love / and lamenting as lovers
are wont that love fervently / with most gentle and friendly familiarite /
does comfort and chere her: this great swetenes I say / whereto should I
remember? Let them rehearse hit that have knowledge thereof. But they know hit
and that happilye / the which pleased god should have experience. I am
unworthy as yet to be admitted to come to these delites: or though I have a
little skle^derly tasted thereof / yet I had rather tell it by other than by my
self. And though hit be more certain to tell it by my self / yet it is more
comely that I show it by other. I have hard some say many times with weeping
tears / yt these worldly pleasures / ye which unto folyshe bragging fellows
savor so well / have seemed unto them so bitter and so sower / that their mind
has not only aborred those things / but also their ears to here speak of
them / as when the use of bread was found / acornes began to be lothed and
naught set by: so the false delites began to wax loathsome to them / after
they had taken a taste of the very true pleasures. But helas very many worldly
people of that rustical and blounte sort / have taken such a smacke in this
swynishe fedynge / that nothing save their acornes can savor unto them. Nor
they understand not what iocundyte of lyte there may be / or why they should
desire to live here in this world / if the acornes / that is to say ye
voluptie and pleasure of the belly and mouth / should be taken away from
them. And therefore so often as they se us religious me^ take such labors and
pain as they suppose they could not endure / and yet to be more lustye / more
merye / and in better plite and liking than they be that do nothing else but
banquet and make good chere / they maruayle out of all measure: Nor they can not
perceive how we should have any pleasure / after we have forsaken and thrown
away from us the delectatio^s and pleasures of the flesh. And yet these men
se tender young men and also delycate virgins / they se their years and shap /
and they remember / how soft and wantonly they were a little before
cherished and brought up: and on ye other side they leave not vnreme^bred / if
in our religious life be any thing sharp / grievous or peynefull / as
solitariness / labor / watch / fasting / and such like things. They se
that it is not only lefull unto these young children to leave and forsake this
manner of life / but also with what great instance of their parents and friends
/ they be intyced / monished / prayed / and vehemently stered to forsake their
religion: But contrary wise / the more they be persuaded / the more obstinate
they be. Their mother that wepeth and waylethe they comfort and bydde to be of
good chere / with their eien dry: Their sister collynge them about the neck /
they shake of and despice: And from their most dear play feres / from whom
but a littell before to be abse^te a day / was a very hard thing / they be
now right easily all their life during plucked away. Finally they take their
leave and bid fare well with so merry a countinance / and kiss at their last
partynge with so glad chere / that no man that is by / though he be a stranger
can forbear weeping. It pleases me here (and I pray the be not agreued
therewith) to remember the heuye and lamentable soupper / which was the last
soupper / that Margerete the good virgin / the which I loved as she had been
mine own sister / had with her parents and fre^des. I was there present the
same time / and so were many mo as well as I / the which the maiden had
desired to come thither / to thentent / that by our procuration and help she
might opteyne of her father / that that she had frustratly or in vain desired
of him.vi. years day before / that was to give her leave to be an nun. For
she had than gotten her mothers good will. And yet to say the treuthe / this
difficulty of either of them / did not chance of any vice. For like as they
were in their country both reputed and of lineage with the best, even so they
were in virtue: that there was no man but that he did both love and preyse them
/ which thing is rathe or seldom seen in them that be in welthe and
felicite: But they be so tender over and love their children so / as though
they greatly loved them. So we began to entreat and persuade her father.
What should I make many words? He being overcome partly with shamefastnes /
partlye with pity and compassion of his daughter / and partlye with our eggyng,
granted her request. But than thou should sodaynely have seen there a right
miserable syghte. The father in collynge and kissing of his daughter / began
so to lament and weep / as though she should forth with have been laid in her
grave. Her mother for very sorrow fell down deed in all wound. Her only
brother and her sister that was a little elder than she / weeping and crienge
out / enbraced their dear sister / and said: By these our weeping tears / and
for what so ever brotherly and systerly pite and tender love may do / we pray
you sweet sister / that ye forsake us not thus your miserable brother and
sister / leest that you being but one distroy us twayn. The other friends
wept, some privily, some openly / some entreated / some persuaded / and some
blamed or rebuked: but there was none among them all / but that the tears
ran from his eyes. And we also that came to entreat for the maid / were so
moved / what with ye weeping of other that were there, and with ye lame^tation
of her father from whose eyes the tears ran as he had been a child / began
like wise to weep / ye which thing though I say it / besemed us not. Yea and
it almoost repented us / that we had gone so far in the matter. What trow ye
did the young virgin this while / the which co^sideryng her sex or kind /
her tender age / her soft nature and bringing up / was so delycate? Saint
Paul him self wha^ he took leave to depart from his brethren / showed that
he was moved with their weeping / though it were not greatly / saying / what do
ye weeping and troublynge mine heart? But the virgin (all though she was of a
greatte pity or mekenes to her father and mother) with her eyes dry / a merry
chere / and smiling on her father / she said / that he had no cause to be so
vexed and grieved / but he ought rather to rejoice and be glad / as he that
had not lost his daughter / but as he that was sure to find her, the which
should pray to god for him. She also endeavored her self diligently / with
kissing / prayenge / and pratye exhortation to ease and appease her mothers
heavy heart / and other that were there. But all was in vain: for they drove
forth and prolonged the soupper with syghynge and sobbing / weeping / and
complaynyng / till it was very late in the night / and except Margarete /
there was not one merye among them all. So often as they se these things (for
they must needs se such things other while) I mean these fellows / the
which as I have said / ben all given to bodily pleasure / they weep with the
other / they maruayle at the stoutnesse and strength of their young minds /
yea and are ashamed of their own soft delycacy. What suppose they? Deem they
these years, these merry countina^ces, these bodies / and these stomakes / to be
so soon inclined, yea so utterly to set naught by the pleasures of the world
/ except they found other / that be to them more leauer? Would they so
obstinately / and with so good a courage take these labors upon them / if they
did not know very well / that they be sweet and pleasant? So it is good Joyce
/ so hit is plainly: a thing that is sweet and pleasant to them that be
expert therein / seems sower and hard to them that be inexpert thereof. But
how long shall it be er thou persuade these fellows to believe the? For as
saint Bernarde says / they se our crosses / but they se not our unctions:
Truly I would they had a better mind / ne were hit that they have a pleasure
frantyckely to err / like as Argiuus did / of whom Flaccus speaks. But seeing
that we be not far from ye error of Argiue / I will plainly persuade the.
Would to god yt I might lefully have my wysshe / that like as this my writing
shall come before thy syghte / that so mine affection might enter in to thy
my^de / that is to say / that thou should be so affectioned / when thou
redest it / as I was wha^ I wrote it. Than here I would make an end of mine
epistil: and would think that I neded not to spend many mo words to persuade
the. But parauenture because that, that I desire is frustrate or i^ vain and
that mine auctoryte is not sufficient to persuade yt / I will bring forth saint
Hieronime, the which by reason of his good and holy life / was a man of great
grauyte / and by reason of his counnyng / a very noble man. I pray the tell me
most holy man / what do thou in this sharp and comforteles desarte alone /
all most deed for hunger / so lean with continual watchyng, and wasted away
with so great labors / haste thou no iocu^dite or pleasure of thy life? O /
says he / while I was in wyldernes / in that greatte desarte / the which
being burned and parched with the heat of the son / is but a very course
and a hard harboroughe for monks / how often times thought I my self to be
among the delitis and pleasures in Rome? And I take god to witness / that
after many a weeping tear / and after that I had long looked upward to heaven
in co^templation / me thought many times that I was among a great sort of
aungelles / and being glad and joyful. I sange thus / Post te in odorem
vnguentorum tuorum curtemus, In ye smell of thy sweet savors we will ron after
the. Haste thou hard good Joyce / what this holy man confessethe here? I could
recyte other to witness the same / but either we must give crede^ce to him or
else to no man: And this same pleasure every good, devout / and well disposed
soul has and enjoys. Yet besides these things / excellent learned me^ have
an other special pleasure / yt is as often as they read the enditynges of most
noble writers / or else when they them self write things for other to read:
or else when they reuolue in their mind such things as they have read.
This kind of pleasure is so variable and so abundante / that hit shall never
seem tedious or make the weary. For if they list to drink of the first
fountaynes / than they resort to the volumes of the old and new testament.
If that verite / of it self honestly arayd / and hyghted with the fresh garment
of eloquence / does delight them / they re^ne to saint Hieronyme / saint
Augustine / saint Ambrose / Cypriane and such other. If those be not eloquent
enough to thy mind / and have a lust to here some christen Cicero: take and
put Lactantius Firmianus in thy bosom. And in case that thou canste be content
with less costlye apparayle / and sobre fare / than take in thy hand Thomas /
Alberte / and such like books. But and thou can not belong abse^t from the
other thyn old friends, yet hardyly visette those to / now and than among /
so that it be guest wyle and not as one of householde. For among those is she
the barborous woman / but yet she has a very honest countinance: the which
when thou have rauyshed and cut away her hears and nails / thou shalt of
a drabbe make her thy laufull wife. Lo / thus thou have the secret and many
volumes of holy scripture, thou have the monumentis of the holy prophettes / of
the apostils / of their interpretours / and of the doctors / thou have the
wrytynges of the philosophers and poetis / the which should not be eschewed of
him, that knows how to chose the wholesome herbs among those that are
venomous. Tell me / what time thou art conversant among these things /
quietly at rest in thy study / and at thine own liberty / void of all care
and trouble / does hit not seem that thou dwell in a paradise of all
delites and pleasures? what place can be tedious / where so great variete is?
What thing is here / that is not full of pleasure? How gladsomely grow ye
fair feldis and meadows? How pleasantly lustreth or shows the fresh grene
grass, depeynted with diverse colors of flowers? In yt place growethe the
beautyfull red rose / there spring ye lylyes as white as any snow / there
be the banks of the lusty purpull violettes / there grows the brown time /
that smellethe so swetelye. Nor there wantethe no fair woods / with broad
hanging bows and branches / that makes a right delectable shadow / wherein
we may defend us from the feruente heat of the day. Farther / what nombre of
trees be there / that bear fruit not only delicious in taste / but (which is
more) very wholesome to eat? And very nere there unto runs the clear
christalline river / that makes a doulce mourmour or noise in runnynge / the
which watreth and moysteth all to gether. This most deep river / I say / the
which the prophet maruaylynge at can not be over come. Within these pleasant
orchardes thou may room and wander to and fro / yea I may say thou may
wantonly sport and play the as often as thou will. What like pleasure is in
your daunsinges / in your tauernes and ale houses / and in your bathes or hot
houses? To these things good Joyce / I call the / as he that is excellently
learned and studious. Yea I desire the / as my special and dear friend, to come
unto these pleasures. Is there any thing behind / that may tarry the in the
world / or else make the afraid to come to us? Thou have well understand /
how mortal / how bitter / and how sower the lewd lusts or false
enticeme^tis of the world be: the which (as Seneca says) enbrace and clyppe
us / to the end that they may strangle or shoke us. Thou haste also hard / how
little goodness is in the worldly riches, and how unsteadfast and
disceyuable they be. And as I suppose, hit is sufficiently showed, in to what
calamyties and myseries the worldely honors do heedlynge overthrow a man.

Farthermore, hit has been declared, how untreatable the necessity of Death
is. Finally, I have remembered unto the, how full of peril and danger this
life is: and unto what grievous and peynefull labors hit is subject. Go now
and questenne with thy self, whether thou had leauer stycke still in these
yuels, or else throw them away / and flee hither. And contrary to these
things, haste thou not hard what liberty, what quiet, what pleasure, and
what sure trust is in religion? And yet for all yt, thou fleest not thither?
Doste thou yet stay / doste thou yet take deliberation / doste thou yet
prolonge forth the time? Leave to the Egypcions their pottis of flesh, that
thou may be fed with manna in the wilderness. But thou sayste, hit is a
hard thing to be drawn away from their company, that a man most derely
loves / and to overcome the affections of friends. Aye good Joyce, thou
call hit a hard thing / take heed that thou be not rather tender and
soft. Beware lest young children boys and maids, to whom this matter does
seem nothing hard, cock up against the and say these words: Say that
thou art unable to do that that we can away with? Why have thou a berde? Why
art thou called a man? What avail thy years of age? And wherefore serves thy
erudition and learning? Think not, that any thing is more fooe or ennemy to
the, than such friends / the which labor to let or hyndre thy health? The
which friends / if error be cause of their offense, or else dote in love /
do thou desire to doote with them? Or if by sad advise / and prudently
pondrynge the matter / they let and hyndre the / for what manner of friends wylt
thou deem them / when they covet not it that is best for the? But thou say to
lead an angels life, and live in the flesh passes man's power. Finally /
when a man can not live after his own fashion, but must do every thing as an
other shall command him / orels to be led after the lust and pleasure of
an other, is sooner said than done. Truly I will not deny this thing, for I
am not ignorant that man's life on earth is a warfare. But if there be any grefe
or difficulty in a matter, that one goth in hand with, hit is wont most
commonly to be in the entrance or beginning, the which if thou may ones
stoutely break or overcome, thou haste escaped: Hit is long ago commonly
said: He has atcheued half his warke or busynes, that has begu^ne aright.
But truly he that does well begin here, does well nere make an end. But
the first entrance abasheth the. I know how to deliver the of this
fearfulness. If hit grieve thy mind to be plucked away from the pleasures of
the world / remember inwardely the eternal delectations and plesures. If
religion seem grievous and peynful to the, have a respect to the pains
everlasting. No punishment should be grievous unto ye / whereby thou may avoid
everlasting pains: nor for no pleasure here to forgo the celestial pleasure.
Finally / nothing shall be hard / that one wyllyngly will do: Nor doubt not
but thou shalt bring well to pass / what soever thou ghost about, so that
Christ be helping thereunto.

How one ought to enter in to religion with good deliberation and aduisement.
The.xii. and last Chapter.
I Saw the well ere trusse up thy bag and baggage and so prepare thy self
ready, as though thou would in all the have flee unto us. But to the end that
thou should not be to hasty / I will brefely give the monitio^ or warning
before hand / lest it should happen unto the as hit does to many now a days
/ the which repent them that they went in to religion for this cause / that
they as hit were in to a deep pytte / that one can not get out of / went not
softely and advisedly down / but lepte even at al adventures. No man is
constrained to Christis profession / but no man may return or go from it: for
without hit there is no hope of salvation. But in other institutions and orders
of the life / the which for a time men have invented / because of ye great
variety that is in men's bodies and minds / and so greatte alteration of all
humayne things / perauenture it were not expedient / so to bind any man /
that it should not be lefull for him to go back / so that the change make and
be more for his soul health / that cha^geth. But saying that they will have
hit other wise / by whose arbitrament the world is governed / this busynes
should be taken on hand more circumspectly / the which thing ones entered and
professed, can not be changed or revoked, at his liberty / that enters
therein. The monasteries in old time were none other thing / but certain
solitary places of good and virtuous men: the which either for grefe and
werynesse of the volupties and vices / with the which in those days the life
of mortal creatures was contaminate and defiled: for at that season the
Christen people and the paynyms lyuedde myngled to gether: orels being agreued
with the cruelte of persecution / they forsook the citees and towns, and
withdrewe them self in to mountains withont ways / where they led a life
angelical. Their apparayle or clothing was poor and little worth / their
fare was sklender / such as lightly they myssed not to find in every place /
wherewith they spente away all their time either in singing of holy ymmes, or
in holy redynge / or in heavenly talkynges / or i^ devout prays / or in deeds
of charity, wherewith they refresshed the sick and wayfarynge folks / or else
in inocent works / with the which they help and succored the indygente and
nedy. Nor a monk was none other thing than a pure Christen man. Nor a
monastery was none other thing / than a flock or a company / the which had
conspyred or consented to gether / to follow the most pure doctrine of
Christ. There was no sovereign commandment: every man gladly and with good
will, yea and that quyckely did their duty / and they had than more need to
be refrayned than prycked forward. Their extreme punyshement was a friendly and
a brotherly correction. How many monasteryes be in the mids of the world /
nor they be noone other wise out of the world / than the reins be out of a
man's body. In the which the discipline of religion does flourysshe in such a
wise / that they be none other thing than Schools of impyetie. To whom the
title and habyte of religion serves for none other purpose / than that it
should be lefull for them without punysshemente to do what ever they list. And
unto them / to whose prudence the world would not commytte their ketchyns /
the business of the church is delivered. And trewely among these things /
wherein the discipline of religion does flouryshe / there is some difference.
Some institution or order of the life is more meter for some one man than for
some other. And therefore it behooves the first to search and make a proof of
thy self / and when thou know what thou may away with / than with good
aduysement / chose an order of living that is not unknown unto the /
according to Saint Paul's saying / Prove all things / and hold the unto
that / that is good. Many one enters in to religion for none other entente /
but to live more commodyously at their pleasure / minding more the bealye than
the soul. And so those that very indigence and need to live honestly in the
world / should have induced to use frugalitie / to have been dylygent, and
industrious, in monasteries they give them self to sleuthe and luxure. And
those that were in the world very poor and of low degree / under the
profession of poverty they imitate and follow the pomp, the sumptuousnes, and
stately array of princes and great lords. And those that should have been
contented with one wife / and have suffered the incommodities and grefes of
Matrimony / now freely and with good leave / they walowe in every kind of
stupre or carnal lust. And those that before time the fear of the laws and
governors / did restrain from doing of yuell and sinful deeds / as exe^pted
from the jurisdiction of the bishop, and of the rulers of the common welthe /
they have a more liberty to sin and offend. So that by feyned profession of
poverty / they flee poverty: by feyned profession of chastity / they provide
for their carnal lust: and by feyned profession of obedience / they find the
mean / that they will be constrained to obey no man. Farther more / there be
other / the which by some chance were driven to this manner of life: One
because he could not opteyne the favor of some maid / that he vehemently
loved: an other because he was stryken with great fear in the time of a
tempeste / of a sickness / or of an other peril / he made such a vow. Some
be drawn to religion by one that has been before time their derely beloved
companyon. Some with shameful eggynges / as hit were buguls be drawn in to
the ditche by the nostrils. Some also be trust in to religion by their unkind
and ungentle parentis: or else by their tutours / to the intent to be eased
of their cost and charge: they most specially lay awayte to attrappe and
disceyue the simple youth / the which is very easy to begyle. But I would
counsel the clean contrary / that rude and ignorant youth should not be
wrapped in an institution, out of the which they can not be drawn back
again. One ought to be a christen man betymes / and a monk at leiser / how
be hit he is a monk at the full / who so ever be a pure christen man. Nor there
be not a few / the which be led to religion by superstition / or else by
folishenes / the which being ignorant in what thing the very religion
restethe / seem as they think them self / gaye monks / if they wear a
gyrdyll or a hoode. And therefore thou should maruayle never a deal / though
thou se them more lewd and wicked after they have professed religion / than
they were before. Thus mine own good Joyce / when thou haste got the knowledge
and understanding / what thing the true religion is / after thou haste assayed
/ thy wit / thy body / and thy mind / and when thou have spyed out a kind
of living mete for thy purpose: and when thou haste found out a feloweshyppe
/ the which all to gether with one assente / have fullye determined their
minds to live after Christ: than get the thither. But look that thou leave
all covetousness of this world at home: for other wise it were frustrate or a
thing in vain to forsake the world / if thou should carye the world with
the in to the same monastery. Carye no manner of delectations of Aegypte with
the / if thou will speed the to the land that flows or abounds with milk
and honey. Many think them self the very folowers of saint Antony / and of
saint Paul / if they haunte no drabbes / nor use no daunsynge / nor will not
be dronken / though they with in forth be all to moysted or sprincled with
hatred / envy / detraction / poysonfull words / and are proud and stately of
conditions / froward / and untreatable / and are lovers of them self: and for
their winning and advantage they openly flatter great princes: and wittyngly
and of a fore cast they suffer the glory of Christ to be obscured and blotted
out / to the end that they may procure their own glory. Inceste / that is to
say carnal copulacion utterly prohibited or foul polucion is a sklaunderous
crime / and yet I trow they be not clear of those vices: but this flatterye
passethe an hundred incestis / and the mischief thereof spredeth most largely
over all mankind. Now perauenture thou will say to me / that all
monasteries displease the: nor there can be found no where a flock / that
has with pure minds consented to live after Christ. But yet look that thou
so leave and forsake the world / that thou may accompany thy self with who
so ever be most innocente: and repute thy self to be in a monastery / where
so ever thou be conversant among them / that love troth / pure chastity /
sobrenes / and temperance / and do both in word and deed express the same.
Nor thou should not thy^ke, that there wants any thing for the to vow /
if thou accomplish and fulfill the vow that thou made to Christ at thy
christenyng. Nor thou should not desire the habit of the white friar or
else of the black / if thou observe and keep clean undefiled / the fair
white vesture or garment that was delivered to the in baptism. Nor be not
dyspleased with thy self / though thou be not of ye flock of black friars
or white, so yt thou be of the flock of true Christian people.

Thus farewell mine own good Joyce.
