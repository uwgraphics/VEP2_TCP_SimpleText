Household Talk, OR; Good Council for a Married Man.
Delivered in a Prittie Dialogue, By Roger a Bachelor, to Simon, A (Jealous)
Married-man.
To the Tune of Buckle and Thong a.


Simon. Neighbor Roger woe is me,
I am sorely discontented,
No redress at all I see.
more and more I am tormented,
Night and Day,
I piue away.
Whilst my dearest friends do scoff me,
to, my face they (boldly) say,
My Cosen makes a Cuckold of me.

Roger. Neighbor Simon be not sad,
let not Passion ouer-sway thee,
If thy Wife will be so bad,
that in such false coin she will pay thee,
Why therefore,
Should thou deplore,
Or wear stockings that are yellow,
tush be blithe (man) grieve no more,
A Cuckold is a good man's fellow.

Simon. Ah, how can I choose but be,
grieved and vexed out of measure,
When with mine own eyes I see,
him a Rival in my pleasure,
With sore sobs,
My bosom throbs
When I hear my Neighbors scoff me,
of all joy my heart it robs,
My Cosen makes a Cuckold of me.

Roger. Iealousie's a mad disease,
and upon the brain it works,
Like tormenting Lice or Fleas,
it in secret Corners lurketh,
But that he,
Who ere he be.
Shows himself in wit but shallow,
to be vexed with Jealousy,
A Cuckold is a good man's fellow.

Simon. It Is a saying long ago,
used by those that know it truly,
Every man can tame a Shroe,
but he who has a wife unruly,
And he that wears,
The Shoe declares,
Best where it wrings him: do not scoff me,
this report still fills mine ears,
My Cosen makes a Cuckold of me.

Roger. Tush, then it seems it is bare report,
not apparent by Probation,
Neighbor I am sorry for it,
that on such a weak foundation,
You should frame,
Such a Fame,
Of your wife, it is naught I tell you,
yet suppose she were to blame,
A Cuckold is a good man's fellow.

Simon. Alas dear neighbor you mistake,
it is not on mere supposition,
That I this relation make,
I have grounds for my suspicion,
He and she,
So agree,
That unto my face they scoff me,
any man may ea^^ly see.
My Cosen makes a Cuckold of me.

Roger. Presuppose that all be true,
(as I hardly can believe it,)
Yet it is but vain for you,
in the worst sense to conceive it,
I dare say,
(As I may)
It Is but flammes some Gossips tell you,
yet if she have gone astray,
A Cuckold is a good man's fellow.

The second Part, To the same Tune,


Simon. Truly neighbor Roger now,
I perceive that you are leaning,
To defend (if you knew how)
the knave and queen, I find your meaning,
I suppose,
You Are one of those,
That behind my back will scoff me,
now I find the game how't goes,
My Cosen makes a Cuckold of me.

Roger. Jealous Coxcombe leave thy prate,
do not thus bewray thy folly,
If Cornuting be thy fate,
be not mad with Melancholy,
I do scorn,
To subborne,
He, or She in vice to wallow,
yet IN de have thee hide thy horn,
A Cuckold is a good man's fellow.

Simon. Neighbor Roger when you come,
into the row of neighbors married,
I believe you'ie not be dumb,
if things be no better carried,
Then they be,
Now with me,
Far and near the people scoff me,
like you I wish that I were free.
My Cosen makes a Cuckold of me,

Roger. Neighbor Sim I do not know,
what my Fate may be in choosing;
But if I'ere come i'th'row,
I Am resolved not to be musing,
Whether she,
Be true to me,
I will not show my self so shallow,
for if I be like to thee.
A Cuckold is a good man's fellow,

Simon. Honest Roger by my troth,
thou ha^^ given me satisfaction,
From henceforth upon my oath,
(unless I take them in the action)
I will not
My self besot,
With Jealousy that made some scoff me,
yet 'twill hardly be forgot,
My Cosen makes a Cuckold of me.

Roger. Prithee Sim forget it quite,
think thy wife is constant to thee,
This is one thing, mark it right,
many good turns it will do thee,
If thou seek,
Her use to break,
Rather strive to stop a Billow
of the Sea; tush never speak,
A Cuckold is a good man's fellow.

Simon. Now I am resolved to the full,
never more I will be Jealous,
Nor will I mistrust my Scull,
I Will be merry with good fellows,
Home I Will hie,
By and by,
Kiss my Wife (with due submission)
thanks sweet Roger heartily,
For thy wholesome admonition.
