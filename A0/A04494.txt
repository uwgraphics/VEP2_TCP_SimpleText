TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, SIR WILLIAM St. JOHN Knight, Couernour of the
Countries of Ginney, and Binney: Sr. Allen Apsley Knight, Liuetenant of the
Tower of London, and Deputy Governor as a foresaid: Sr. Thomas Button Knight,
and other the Noble Knights, and Gentlemen, adventurers for the said Countries
of Ginney and Binney.
Honorable Gentlemen:
IF it may please you to take into consideration, the cause of publishing this
ensuing treatise, it may some-way satisfy for my presumption, in offering to
bring to the public press, that which to you has bin so chargeable in
discovering, and therefore by all reason to you belongs the benefit of what is
discovered, or at the least free will to dispose of your own privileges as to
your wisdom should be most approueable; But such are the turbulent spirits of
some men, that no courtesies can win fair correspondency, but as professed
enemies to the ingenious search of worthy minded Gentlemen, proclaim wars
against their endeavors, if they tend to merchandising, thereby intermedling (as
they term it) to discover their secret mystery, although in their perticulars
to begin such an interprize, they can no ways parallel the meanest of your
true experience and well grounded desigments, but it might have bin hoped, that
there would have been some better respect toward you, in regard of your
persons, and not to deal in that nature as to every ordinary Gentleman, or
other by them employed, by whose industry after the way is opened to any
profitable business, and that he has made plain the discovery, then they
do find occasion to cavil and turn them off, and presently employ servants
of their own, many times very unfitting, in regard they will not requite
deserts, nor allow of any society in an apparent way of gain: All which is
endeavored toward you, for whilst you have bin suffered to disburse your moneys
in the first discovering, and as it were beating and laying open the way, where
and how this Golden Trade should rise, you have quietly past one, but now there
can be no more euasions, but that the profit plainly appears; what complaints
have bin framd? what combination and plotting together? Wherein to avoid
suspicion, the face of simplicity, the honest Countryman has bin made the
instrument to bring about the incroaching gain they aimed at: That it may
therefore appear, how the first grounds of this hopeful business by you were
laid, and how you have seconded one loss by another, and how needful and
necessary it is, that you should now proceed to follow what is begun, and make
use of what you so dear have paid for; I have written this Discourse out of my
own careful observation, in the time of my employment for you, that you might
(if you please) see what you have done, and what (if it please God to bless
the courses) you are like to do, which may not only encourage you, but inuit
other Gentlemen of your Rank, to associate with you, to follow and proceed
upon this hopeful enterprise, wherein intending faithfully, in demonstrating
the truth, to manifest the zeal and service I must ever owe you, humbly
craving pardon, I remain

Your devoted Servant, RICHARD IOBSON.

The Inuitement to this golden Trade, showing the cause of the first vnderta
king it, and orderly proceedings therein.
IT has been the usual course (for the most part,) of such as travail
Foreign parts, in the obseruiug and setting down such things as they see, to
neglect the noting of what is held public, in regard that after the whole
Company, be they 60. 40. or but ten together, have taken perfect view, it
stands conceited, the same is as well manifest to our whole Country, whereby
diverse times, many things worthy of note here at home, to such as take
pleasure in reading of other men's adventures, and delight in variety of other
nations, are either quite left out, or slited in so poor a manner, as the
Reader goes away unsatisfied: I having received this caveat from that worthy
gentleman, Mr. Samuel Purchus, who is so dilligent a searcher, and setter forth
of all our English travails, of whose true industry those great volumes he
has published to the world, shall be perpetual witness, spending therein (as he
rightly terms it) his talent for his Countries service, and being likewise
encouraged by him, after he had seen and read my iournall breefly relating
each days particular, in my travails, into this great and spacious Country:
whereof by Gods grace I entend to write, laying as it were a command upon me,
not to conceal that, which by publishing may first tend, unto the advancement
of Gods glory, and next undoubtedly the honor, wealth, and preferment of our
own nation: Likewise having been still earnestly invited by all sorts of
people, and especially by some of worthy note, (as occasions have fallen out at
any time, whereby I have been drawn into discourse of these travails) that I
ought not, nor might not without offense leave vnpublished, that which does
proffer so apparent hopes of so great a golden Trade, which at this time seems
so needful, that by the general complant of our great want, the earth has
shut up her rich bowels toward us in other places, the rather to enuite us to
seek after that, which lies as it were under our noses, in respect of other
travails, and has been lest as a concealed business, vntell our time of
need, that then it might be more effectually followed, and more seriously
regarded: For apparent proofs whereof, first there is no Historian but will
accord, that in all ancient Histories discoursing of the inward parts of
Africa, assurely always called by the name of Ethiopia, it has been noted
for the golden region, in the whole conquests of Alexinder, as Quintus Curtius
sets it down, lie only had a great desire to visit these parts of Ethiopia,
but never came there. The Romans likewise, careful Relaters of their great
victories, do speak little of the interior parts of Africa, their greatest
entrance being in the wars of Iugurth, and in pursuit of him, only mention is
made, of a great desire they had to search the South parts, in regard they were
thereunto invited, by those rich and golden arms, they found those black
people to come against them withal, where of so many golden shields, were
carried to their famous City, in their so glorious triumphs, but in their
discoueries they had no success: Returning with the loss of most of their
people, in regard as is alleged, they met with diverse dry and sandy deserts
to pass, wherein as many were lost and ouer-whelmed, so again the parching
heat, and continual droughth was cause of the perishing of many others, and
enforced their return, without any satisfaction.

The self same causes continue still, for which we need not search written
books, but talk or discourse with any Merchant of this City of London, who
have yearly trade and commerse in Barbary, being the nearest parts of Africa,
adjoining unto us, and many times from our Country, into their principal
Harbors, run in twelve days, and in the like time again, from them to us,
and inquire of them, whence the Moore of Barbary has that rich gold, he makes
his Chequens of, and they will tell you, there is no gold growing, within the
confines of Morocco, or Fesse, at least that is known, or made use of, but
that the great abundance of The trade of the Moors in in Barbary for their
gold.
that rich gold they have, is fetched and brought into the Country, by the
natural inhabitants, for which they undergo great travails, only by land
wherein they do pass great deserts of sand, with much danger, as appears by
the loss they receive many years, of diverse both of their people, and
Cammels, yet so commodious is their trade, and followed with such great
diligence and government, that amongst themselves, none are admitted but
principal persons, and by especial order, without entertaining any other
nation, what respect or familiarity so ever, they have gained amongst them.

This in effect has been the sole ground, to attain unto that knowledge,
which I presume here to write for my Countries service, wherein duty
especially requires me, to manifest the care and diligence, of those noble and
worthy Gentlemen, who are the grounds, and originals of this hopeful work,
unto whom these my labors, as their own proper rights are dedicated, whose
virtues aiming at good actions, in this our blessed and peaceful time, and
cessation from those sea affairs, they were wont to be bufied in summond them
up, to in quire and make search after the goldnest hopes, and upon good
grounded conferances with such principal Merchants of Barbary as their
wisdoms could make choice of, attain some better satisfaction, to their
former knowledge of the Moore of Barbarios Marchandizing, as I lightly have
touched before, wherein their practice and true understanding in the
Mathematiques assured them, the Moors unknown travail must be to the
South-west, if other ways our Quotidian trade, into all and every part of the
Mediterrane sea, must needs have had some or other intelligence. And theresore
uniting themselves together, concluded upon a lawful and warrant-able course

golden trade, by the South-parts, and to adventure upon those promising
rivers, that fall into the maine Ocean, on the South-west side, wherein it now
requires, I should briefly relate, the manner of their proceeding.

In the year 1618. in the month of September, they set forth a ship called the
Catherine, burden 120. tun, and in her imployd on George Thompson a man about
fifty years of age, who had lived many years a Merchant in Barbary, the
carcazon of goods he carried with him amounted unto 1856 f. 19 s^. 2 d. The
first voyage.
having his instructions from the Governor and Company to enter in the River
of Gambra, and with such shallops, as he had, and were thought convenient for
him, to follow his trade, and to discover up the River, leaving the ship in a
secured Harborough: All which in his part being carefully performed, in his
absence, through the overmuch trust of our English hearts, and fair
familiarity we use to all nations, with whom we are in amity, the ship was
betrayde, and every man left in her, his throat cut, by a few poor dejected

and Melatos, whom they gave free recourse aboard, being only banished people,
and for the most runnagados from their Country, as when I come more
particularly to write of them, will more fitly be delivered: Thompson upon
intelligence, being gotten far up into the River, and finding the
inhabitants to use him courteously, with the Kings allowance of the Country,
seated himself upon the land, and thorough the kindness of the inhabitants,
near those parts where the ship was lost, some of the English who came down
from Thompson, where safely conueighed many days travail over land, until
they found means, to meet with shipping to transport them home, with their
woeful tidings: Whereupon the noble Adventurers, with all expedition set forth
a Pinnace of fifty tons, called the S. John, and in her a new supply of
goods, and direction to Thompson, either for his repair, withal his Company
home, The second voyage.
or as he did affect his trade, or had hope of his discovery, to make use of
those goods, and abide there: He utterly refused to come away, and therefore
sent away the S. John, who for that they came in an unseasonable time, which
then experience made them understand, and thorough some other abuses, which
more conveniently else where I shall set down, which loss of many of her men
returned, and as little comfort of gain to the Adventurers, only hopeful
letters from Thompson, inuiting them to a new supply, and by the next season to
send unto him a ship and pinnace, with some especial commodity he made
mention of, confidently affirming, they should no ways doubt of a hopeful
discovery, where the Moors of Barbary traded, and a valewable return for
their losses sustained, promising in the mean time, which such company as he
had left with him, being in all only eight persons, in his small boat to
search up the River, which he attempted in a pair of Oars, taking only two
of his own Company with him, the rest people of the Country, which whom he
past up the River, and got to Tinda, a place he aimed at; in hope to have had
conference with a black Merchant, called Buckor Sano, (of whom I shall have
cause to speak in the Relation of my own travails) failing of him, for that
he was then in his travails within the land, he stayed not many hours above,
how-be-it in that time, he received such intelligence of the trade he looked
after, that such an ecstasy of joy possessed him, as it is and has been
aleadged against him, that growing more peremptory then he was wont, and
seeming to govern with more contempt, by a quarrel falling out amongst them
one of his Company Captain Thompson slain.
slew him, to the utter loss of what he had attaind unto, who in regard of
emulation in striving to keep others he affected not in ignorance, committed
nothing to paper, so as all his endeauours and labors were lost with him.
These things I have presumed to write, that it may appear, what rubs have
been in the infancy of this discovery, and may partly make answer to the
question may be propounded, by any that shall be pleased to read over my
ensuing discourse, why so hopeful and promising abusinesse should be
neglected.

And now I return to the worthy Adventurers who little distrusting this
mishap, not withstanding Thompson was slain in March, whereof they could have
no intelligence: In October after being a convenient season set forth again a
ship and Pinnace, the ship called the Syon, burden 200. tun, and the S.
John a Pinnace of 50 tun: The third voyage.
In this ship it pleased them to employ me the present wrighter, and now
what does insewe of this discourse; is written from me either as an eye
witness, or what I have received from the Country people, and none but such,
as were of esteem, and as my confidence assures, would deliver no false thing,
as where I come to speak of the black people in particular, may be more aptly
conceived. The 25. of October 1620. we set sail from Dart-mouth, the 4. of
November, when the day appeared we were up with the Island of Launcerot, and the
next day by noone, past the Canary Island, and had laid all that land the 17. of
November, we came to an anckor in the River of Gambra, having had some occasion
of stay by the way, to the loss of near three days, so as our The whole way
from England to the River, run in 20. days.
whole travail from Dart-mouth thither was in 20. days, we anckored some
four leagues within the mouth of the River.

And to avoid inconveniences, by intermingling one thing with another, to set
down each particular as they presented themselves: I have thought it most
acceptable to the Reader, to divide my discourse into particular heads, the
more aptly to be understood, wherein I think it fit to begin with The
particulers handled in this book.
the description of the River, with the limit and bounds thereof, so far as
we have scene, likewise what opinion experience makes me hold for the
continuance thereof, and how necessary it is, to be searched into for advancing
the Golden Trade, with a relation what we find living therein, which may serve
for sustenance, and maintain the Traveler, next the several sorts of people,

the vagrant Porting all, with the manner of their lives, buildings, and
fortifications, the state of their Kings, and the title of other Commanders,
and their manner of life. The government of the Mary-bucke or Bissareas, the
discourse of their Religion, and seperations from the rest, and course of

Relation of my meeting with Buckor Sano, a great black Merchant, and commerce
with him: Their Iuddies or Fiddlers, and manner of meeting, with the discourse
of circumcision, and report of their devil Ho-re, what manner of trads are
amongst the common people, their order for tilling the ground, and several
sorts of grain, and other plants in use amongst them, and therewith an ample
Relation of the times and seasons of the year, when those great storms of
thunder and lightning, with abundance of rain do fall, the vnwholsomens of the
air in those times and what natural reasons may be all edged as well for
those contagious times, as also to avoid the inconveniences that have formerly
by most of our nations been fallen unto: Again what variety of wild beasts
as well offensive, and ravenous, as also such as are for the sustenance and
comfort of those as travail, we find the Country replenished with, thereunto
adjoining what land foul is likewise there, the abundance of both, which
kinds are always at hand to mend the diet of any ingenious looker out; and
with a brief conclusion from myself, I shut up my discourse unto which
severally I now proceed: and first to the River.

The description of the River.
THIS River, whereof I now take in hand, (by Gods grace) to write, is situate
in the latitude of 13 degrees and, by all or the most part of Mappes and
Cards, and by some called, by the name of Gambia, by others Gamba, and by
another sort set down Gambra, to which latter name being most frequent, I do
apply my self, for by the natural inhabitants, either below in the mouth of
it, neither it above to the farthest I have traveled, being upon the truest
account I could keep, some 320 leagues, or 960 miles, could I ever hear any
proper name, but only the word Gee, which in their language, they use to all
rivers, and waters: It has one sole entrance, which in the very mouth, is
about some 4 leagues broad, and in the channel 3 faddome water, at the least,
without any bar, contrary to the setting of it formerly forth, where it is
generally noted to have a bar, and much sholer water then we have found:
After we are run some 4 leagues in, it does spread it self, into so many
rivers, bays, and creekes, that for the space of some 30 leagues, unto a Town
called Tauckro valley, it is so intricate, thar many months might be spent to
search each particular within that limit; but for that my occasion of writing,
is grounded upon the great hopes, and expectations, that are from above I
entend not to make any stay there, but refer what is to be said, until I speak
of the inhabitants, only, as I proceed to let you know, that the maine
channel, is not to be mistaken, except within the limit aforesaid, and then
also thorough great neglect, or rather some wilful ignorance.

Thus with a fair stream, this brave river shoots in flowing from his
mouth, into the land, near upon 200 leagues, unto a Town called Baraconda, or
some little above, and that is the uttermost bounds of his flowing, even in the
lowest season of the year: For as in all rivers, running into the sea, the
increase of the inland waters, occasioned by raines, or snowes, do abate of
the seas in draught; so much more, in this great River, who swells upright 30
foot, observing one due time, and season of the year for ever, must the seas
force in those swelling times, be mightily driven back; whereby a certain
knowledge is attaind, which are the settled times, to be followed eamestly, to
meet with no impediment, in passing up, which impediment, is only want of
water to pass over flats, which in the lowest season of the year, in certain
places, are met withal, as is commonly seen, in all rivers, of such mighty
inlets, which banks as it were being past, presently a fair passable River
continues, for many leagues; and as we expect our seasons of Winter, and
Summer, so do these inhabitants these times of floods, occasioned by aboun
dance of rain, which raines always proceed forth of the South-east, and have
their beginnings, much sooner in the inland, then at the Rivers mouth, so as in
those parts, where we have had aboade, they begin to fall in the latter end of
May, and at the These are all more largly written of, where the tillage of the
ground is handled.
Rivers mouth, not until the end of June: These raines continue very violent,
for three months, coming down with great winds, and very much thunder, and
lightniug, not perpetually, but as we say, in sudden gustes, and storms, the
violence whereof being ouerpassed, the people continue their labor, as where I
write of their manner of Tillage, is more largely set down, as also a more
free description of these contagious times: The increase of the River likewise,
in the beginning of the year, before any rain is seen to fall where we
aboade, did make it propable, that rain wasfallen, within the land, before we
tasted any, all which affirms the great inlet of this hopeful River, and
gives an assurance, that it is passable, if times and seasons be observed, and
with diligence followed, with boats, and vessels fitted accordingly, as
experience in traveling it already so far, may some ways warrant a
sufficient director.

Next to show a continuance of this great stream, when we had rowed beyond the
ebbing and flowing, and 12. days against the current, which we travailed in
the month of January, when the water was at the lowest of his nourishment, and
then the shole we met withal, and stopped our further proceeding, had 9.
inches water, which shallowness continued not above to yards, wherein if we
had We were 10 of our own company, that went up in a shallop, and 4 Black
that I hired to carry up a Canoe.
been an able company together, being only 10. of us, and likewise had had
provision of tools wherewithal, and been assured of a commodius trade, and
so friendly a people to converse withal, as after we found, any encouragement
would have made us work a gut thorough that little distance, and being past
that place, the river showed himself again, with fair promising, so far as
we bad occasion to look, near a league, and how far he might so continue, we
are ignorant, and in those places above did we see sea-horses, whosenature
requires deep waters, as where I write at large of him, you may better
perceive, likewise the higher still, more store of Crocodiles, which adds
encouragement of the largnesse of the River; and likewise a fair breadth
between the shores: I follow these probabilities, to encourage the farther
search of the River, which dilligently followed, may even in one season, give a
full satisfaction to the forward Aduenturer, and if it so fall out, we can
meet with any town above, standing by the River side, it will assuredly prove
a commodious place, to make our aboade in, to take the advantage of the
seasonable times, and to make returns, to, and again, as experience must
lead, to the greatest advantage. And for trade there is no question, but a
maruailous recourse would be unto us, which is already testified, in that so
many hundreds of them came down unto us, to the remote place where we were
enforced to stay, building them houses of reads on both sides the shore, and
the recourse still more, and more increasing, in so much as we had
intelligence, the people were coming, from a great Town called Iaye in their
language, and we do conceive it to be Gago, if we had been furnished with
commodities enough for them, and likewise known the seasonable times for our
passage in the These (...)
River, and convenient Harborough for our safer aboade; and why may not the
town they call Mumbar, which they say is but 6. days journey from the place
we stayed at, according to their travail, which in the discourse of the people
Laster lay down, belikewise upon the River, if so, how great an advantage,
might it bring unto us, if we were minded to stay there, when the Moore of
Barbary come, for at this town the Carauan from Barbary does stay and abide,
we know their whole trade is for gold, but what quantity they have here, or
what people it is, they trade withal, we are as yet ignorant, and this
adventure up the river, would undoubtedly discover, that the gold is there, we
are assured of, having battered, and had trade for some, and upon trial the
same in goodness, that Barbary affords our Countries, having the river to
friend, we should be able, though but few of us, to defend our selves, from the
rage of the Barbary Moore, if he should attempt any thing against us, for
undoubtedly, when he shall see us entered into his trade, he will appose what
may be, to affront us; And although I have been promised safe defense, by the
country people, yet a boat is a certain retreat, and the River a constant
friend, to trust unto.

Again, what know we, whither the River may bring us within the confines of
those people, who will not be seen, and are those to whom our salt does
pass, of whom in the relation of the Country, in his place, as it follows I
write, and if it be as in all descriptions that are set out, it is laid down,
that the River of Senega, and this River do meet, yet cannot be in any
probability, but a few days journey, above the place, and heigh, we have
already been at, must needs reach to it, and no doubt afterward, that which
affordes two such branches, must contain within himself, a fair and
promising stream, which may take head from some great and large lake, above,
such as is described, to be about Gago, and if any such place should be found,
what use or profit might arise, cannot but promise a hopeful expectation.

And lastly, if the inhabitants above, be enemies amongst themselves, as we see
in the mouth of the River, and hear likewise of them, what advantage our force
in the River, may work, will easily be considered, in regard they have not the
use of any The Country people have no boats or Canoos above the ebbing and

which is about 120. leagues, or 360. miles, which we were traveling, as I have
said before, only 12. days, wherein is to be understood, we labored not the
whole day, but setting forward so soon as it was day light, we continned
working until 9. or 10. of the clock, We labored to get up the River only
7. hours in 24.

and not at all in the night when it was cool, and convenient, for avoiding of
trees sunk, rocks, and sholes, which in the day time we could see, and have
now taken notice of, and perfectly writ down, that upon any second attempt, we
may be much bolder, and thereby ask lesser time for performance, how beit our
return downward, for those 12. days travail, was in 6. and God be praised,

healthful our bodies. And it is likely, if towns were found again, near No

the River, they do so continue, for from Baraconda, whither the River flowed,
we never hard, nor saw of any Town, or plantation, nor recourse of any people
unto us, but what we sent for, neither show of any boat, only some two, or
three bundles of Palmeta leaves, we found bound vptogether, which our Blackes
would tell unto us, some of the people had made shift to pass the river upon,
so as our passage then must needs afford more discouragement to the Actors,
then any that can, (by Gods grace) happen hereafter, for we were discouraged,
that the people above were of a bad condition, if we could pass unto them,
which the inhabitants held, as impossible, in regard they did affirm, the
river was full of trees suncke, and drifts, we should meet withal, and our
time in passing, being uncertain, our provision which was small, might fail
us, and poorly (God knows) we were provided of those materials, that would
have helped to maintain that principal, in respect the place, and way
affords it; and what experience hereafter, can direct in that kind to do,
which being good comforts, and encouragers to the Aduenturer, I will not by any
means leave unwritten.

There is abounding in this River, who are bred and live therein, two sorts
especial, as I may term them monstrous, the one devouring as the people
report, and the other dangerous, as I have found: The devouring is the
Crocodile or Alegatha, because they carry one, and the same resemblance, but
The Description of the Crocodile, whom the Country people call Bumbo.
doubtless, I am persuaded, there is no other Crocodile, but such as we have
seen in this River, whom the people call by the name of Bumbo, sundry times
when we have driven them from the shore, where they have been lying in the
morning, or otherwise forth of the water, when we have observed the print they
leave behind them, upon the foft sand, we have found by measure of rule, his
whole length, from the point of his nose, to the end of his tail, contain
thirty three foot; The people of the Country, stand in such dread of these,
that they dare not wash their hands in the great River, much less, offer to
swim, or wade therein, reporting How the people do fear him.
unto us many lamentable stories, how many of their friends, and acquaintance
have been devoured by them: neither do they at any time bring any of their
Cattle, to pass the River, as within ebbing, and flowing, they have diverse
occasions to do, but with great dread, and ceremony: for at all Towns within
that compass, they have small boats, which we call Canoos, to ferry over
withal, which cannot receive a live beef, only some five or six of the
people: but when they pass a beef over, he is led into the water, with a rope
to his horns, whereby one holds him close to the boat, and another taking up
his tail, holds in the like manner; the Priest, or Mary-bucke, stands over the
middle of the beast, praying and spitting upon him, according to their
ceremonies, charming the Crocodile, and another again by him, with his bow and
arrows ready drawn, to expect when the The manner they pass their cattle

Crocodile will ceaze, and in this manner, if there be twenty at a time, the
pass them one after another, never thinking them safe, until they be on the
top of the River bancke: One thing more, to show the fear they have of him,
when I was going in my discovery up the River; having as I said, only nine of
our own people with me, I did hire Blacke-men, as I had occasion to use them,
to serve as Interpreters, likewise to send abroad, and to help to row, and
get up the boat, so that when I came to pass the flowing, and to go all
against the current, I did furnish my self, of four able Black-men: the first
place we found a stiff gut to resist us, the water being not above four foot
deep, for speedier and more easier passing our men went into the water, and
laying hands, some one the one side of the boat, and some likewise on the
other, waded along, and led her through, which we found a good refreshing; the
River being sweet and clear, was comfortable in the heat, by no means I
could not make any of my black people, go out of the boat, denying flatly to
go into the water, saying that Bumbo would have them; after some The Blackes
would not go into the River.
two of these ages, there was another straight, where was a necessity of more
hands, so that striping my self, I leapt into the water, the Blackes seeing me
prepare, seem much to diswade me, but when they saw me in the water, they
presently consulting together, stripped themselves, and came likewise in, the
business ended, and we all aboard again, I asked of them the cause made them
come in, having so earnestly denied it before, they made answer, they had
considered amongst themselves, the white man, Their answer when they went in.
shine more in the water, then they did, and therefore it Bumbo come, he would
surely take us first, so that after they never refused to go in, yet in all our
whole passage, did we never receive any assult, but to the contrary, where we
have seen great companies of them, lying upon the sands, they have perpetually
avoided us, with the same shines, that Snakes do use, to avoid the noise, and
sight of men here, only boldest to show himself where the water was deepest,
and the Black people, do not stick to say, that since the white men have had
to do in the River, the Crocodile is not so dangerous, as in former times;
Again, whereby it does appear, they are more abundantly above, whereas he
does naturally smell exceeding sweet, after the manner of musk, so as in all
places, where they use to come one shore they leave a sent behind them, that
many times we are not able to receive, but enforced to stop our nostrils:
some three days, before we came to the highest place we stayed at, we began
to find the River water, which was our daily drink, to change his relish, The
strong sent of the Crocodile, changing the taste of the River water, and the
fish were taken in it.
but after we came there, it had such a sweet musky taste, that we not only
refused, to drink of it, but also could not endnre, our meat to be dressed
therewith, but sought out springs and freshes, upon the land, nay more, those
great fish which with our hooks, we took in that place, lost the savor they
had below, and did taste and relish as the Crocodile smelt, that we utterly
refused, to eat them ourselves, but bestowed them upon the people of the
Country, which received them thankfully; land likewise the cry and noise of
them in this place, was more then we had heard all the way, for the noise he
makes is resembled right to the sound of a deep great well, with which the
great ones call one to another, and may be distinctly heard a league, which
surely argues, the continuance of this hopeful river, and that some great lake
above may be the nourisher of them.

The other is the Seahorse, who in this River do wounderfully abound, and for
that the name of Seahorse is a common word, in regard of the Greene-land
voyages, where they use the same to the Sea-mosses they kill there, who are of
contrary The desctiption of the seahorse.
shapes, I think it fit to describe this fish or beast, or what I may call
him, because questionless, there was never beast, nor any thing in that kind,
set forth to show in these our Countries, that would produce more admiration.
He is in fashion of body, a complete horse, as round buttock'd as a horse of
service, and in his whole body answerable: his head like unto a horse with
short ears, but palpably appearing which he wags, and stirs, as he shows
himself, only toward his mouth, he grows broad down like a Bull, and has
two teeth standing right before upon his lower choppe, which are great and
dangerous in regard he strikes with them: his cry, or neighing, directly like
a great horse, and has in the same manner four legs, answerable to his
body, whereupon he goes, and wherewith he likewise swimmeth, as a horse
does, yet in these is his greatest difference, for they are somewhat shorter
in proportion, then horses are, and where they should be round hoofte, it
deuides it self into five paws, upon every which he has a hoof, the whole
foot, containing a compass of great breadth, as the beast is in growth,
insomuch as I have taken the measure of some prints they leave, where they
walk, of twenty inches over: His manner of feeding likewise, resembles the
horse, for although he live all day in the River, yet every night he goes
duly on shore, in diverse places feeding upon their Rice, and Corn, doing the
Country people much spoil, but his general feeding, is upon low marish
grounds, where the grass or sedge is The seahorse feeds in the night upon
the shore.
green, to which they resort in great companies, and in those reaches of the
River, which have deepest water, and lie nearest, and conuenienst, to such
manner of grounds, do we always find greatest store: in some places, they go
a mile from the shore side to their feed, having trackes that are beaten as
hard and palpable, as London high way; he returns by the break of day to the
River, where he is very bold, when our boats come by, he will hold his head
above the water, many times store of them together, and so near as within
Pistolls shot, snorting, neighing, and tossing the water, making shows of
great displeasure, and sometimes attempting it, for in my passage too and
again in the River, my boat was stricken by them three times, and one of the
blows was very dangerous, for he stroke his tooth quite through, which I was
enforced, A dangerous blow, by a seahorse.

but the hazard of them may be well avoided, if men be provided to shoot at
them, when they press ouerbold, which we could not do, in regard out

pieces accordingly, thorough the neglect of some ill wishing persons, who
deceive the trust the worthy Adventurers apposed upon them: In the night, while
we had candle burning, some of them, disturbed by us, would remain in the
River, and would come staring up the stream, snoring, and pressing near upon
us, but we found means to send them packing, for breaking a small piece of
wood, we would stick a short candle lighted upon it, and let it drive with the
stream upon them, from which they would fly, and make way, with a great deal
of horror, and one note we observed amongst them, they werealwayes most
dangerous, when they had their young with them, which they sometimes leave on
shore, but being in the water, every female carries her young upon her back,
so as when she puts up her head, the young head likewise will look his share,
and where they appear many heads together, there is as much variety, as from
the great horse, to the hunting nagge: the Seahorse, we found greatest store:
when we were likewise past the flowing of the tide, and continued above the
highest place we were, which still argues, a large and constant River: The
people do account The Country People esteem the seahorse, for excellent meat.
of these for an excellent meat, not resusing to eat them, if they be taken
up dead in the River, as they are many times found swimming, howsoever they
come killed, howbeit I conceive, the Crocodile and they agree, for that I have
stood upon the bancke, and see them swim, one by another without offense.

Having spoken of these, I now return to matter of sustenance, which the River
affords, there is variety of good fish, among which great store of Mullet, if
men have nets, and provision to take them, which in some places, within the
ebbing and flowing, the shore lies convenient to make use of, and above, that
in most places, howbeit we never made use above any place where our ship
rid, who always kept the net with her, wherewith we made diverse draughts,
most especially at a Town called Cassan, and against which the ship did
ride, and was the highest place in the River she went, where our convenientst
drawing was close to the Town, and when the people at any time saw us bring
our net on the shore, and provide to fish, as the net came near the shore,
they would come rudely in and many times with their vnciuilnes, endanger the
breaking, and spoiling of our net, with their greediness to lay hold on the
fish, that we were enforced to speak unto the King, dwelling in the Town, to
command them to forbear troubling us, promising when we had taken for our own
present use, and reserved some for him, the residue should be taken out and
remain amongst them, and his Command being given, they were careful to
observe it.

Amongst the rest, one time having made a draught, we had not such plenty as
usually, only some fish, in the cod of the net, which being taken up, were
shakt into a basket standing in the boat, with which we rowed aboard, and the
basket being handed in as the custom is, the fish were powered upon the Deck,
whereof many rude Sailors will be their own caruers, amongst which fish, there
was one, much like unto our English breame, but of a great thicknes, which one
of the Sailors thinking for his turn, thought to take away, putting therefore
his hands unto him, so soon as he touched, the fellow presently cried out, he
had lost the use both of his hands, and arms: another standing by said, A
strange operation of a fish.
what with touching this fish? and in speaking, put thereto his foot, he being
bare-legged, who presently cried out in the like manner, the sense of his leg
was gone: this gave others, of better rank, occasion to come forth, and look
upon them, who perceiving the sense to come again, called up for the Cook,
who was in his room below, knowing nothing what had happened, and being come
wild him to take that fish, and dress, which he being a plain stayed fellow,
orderly stooping to take up, as his hands were on him, suncke presently upon
his hinder parts, and in the like manner, made grievous moan: he felt not his
hands, which bred a wonderful admiration amongst us: from the shore at the
same time was coming a Canoe aboard us, in which was a Black man called
Sandy, who in regard he had some small knowledge of the Portingall tongue, had
great recourse amongst us, we brought him to the fish, and showed it unto him,
upon sight whereof, he fell into a laughter, and told us, it was a fish they
much feared in the water, for what he touched he num'd, his nature being to
stroke himself upon another fish, whom presently he likewise num'b, and then
prayed upon him, but bid us cut of his head; and being dead, his virtue was
gone, and he very good to eat: At this place only we should see many Moors
sporting, playing, and coming boldly into the water, a good distance from the
shore, where lay a sandy bank, but they never went beyond their heights, and
they would tell us, there was a blessing granted to that place, by some great
Mary-bucke, that Bumbo should never hurt them; and on that side the Town
stood, as our ship did ride in the middle of the River, and we have observed,
we never saw any Crocodile; but on the contrary side, many times very great
ones; And this being assuredly true, for varieties sake I have placed here.

In the upper part of the River, there are store of fish, and more conveniently
to be come by, if men go provided. Amongst which we note one little fish, The
running fish.
which may well be called the running fish, and is much like our English Roach,
with a red tail, who is enforced to run above the water, and will continue a
great way, but only touching of it, to save his life from his pursuing enemy,
who comes chopping after him, just like the Trout after the fly, and is of
that bigness the Trout is, that sometimes the little fish has run into our
Canoe to avoid the pursuer: Likewise of foul, the higher we go, we find
plenty, and much variety, but this we have ever observed, that in the maine
River, we never see them swimming, but as they are in The nature of the river
foul.
sholes together be they Ducke, and Mallard, or any other in their kind, they
sit upon the shore, close to the River side, and dare not surely venture in, for
fear of the Crocodile, but have their principal feeding upon the marish
grounds, and ponds, which lie from the River, whereof the Country is very full,
and you can find no such place, but is abundantly furnished, among which are
many geese, of color white, and black, rather bigger then our English tame
goose, who has upon each pinion of his wing, a sharp spur, in every point
resembling a Cocks spur of the largest size, with which they are apt, not
being shot dead, to give offense: but for foul that live naturally by the
shore side, as Hernes, Corlews, Storkes, Pluffer and the like, it does yield
plenty, so that whomsoever shall go up well furnished of pieces, and powder,
shall be sure to mend their fare, and light upon many a dainty dish.

The people of the Country have likewise diverse wares, which they make use of
in the time of raines, and when the River is ouer-floude, at which times, they
kill much fish; and they have also, a strange manner of fishing, in their lakes
and ponds, of which there are many that are very broad, and contain much
circute, but are not deep, to which they resort The manner of the peoples
fishing.
as they desire to fish, a whole town or plantation together, only the men,
every one having a kind of basket, with the mouth open, which he holds
downward, and so going into the water, close on by another, they over spread
the pond, whereby the fish is moved; and so clapping down the mouth of their
baskets before them, they hit upon the fish, and in this manner they take so
many that most of them go laden home, and if at any time we be near those
places, they will lovingly impart them to us, upon returns from us of poor
value: These things which now we know, and can tell how to provide for, may
serve as encouragements, to proceed upon a farther discovery, but in that
which follows, concerning the love of the people, what trade we already have
found, and what relief they bring us, and at what rates, as also what Dear,
and wild Cattle the land affords throughout, with such variety of land foul,
and other necessaries, whereof in their due place I mean to speak; I hope (as
I desire) may be some furtherances, to inuit Adventurers, to advise of some
few days search further into this hopeful River: Wherein the very River, if
we had nothing else to friend, proving but as we have hetherunto sound it, will
afford that comfortable relief, men need not stand in dread of staruing,
which considered, and the probable good that may and will rise, in obtaining
the Golden Trade, I conclude it most necessary, to follow dilligently a farther
search, for which if I should be thereunto required, in place convenient, I
could yield some other special account which for some respects I forbear to
publish, and following my order, proceed to the inhabitants.

The several Inhabitants, etc.
TO speak of the Country, and the inhabitants, I take my beginning from the
mouth of the River, whereat our first entrance, we find the Black men called
Mandingos, and that they do continue amongst themselves, still one and the
self same language: Those of them who are inhabiting, or dwelling in the mouth
of the River, or within certain leagues of the first entrance, are very
fearful to speak with any shipping, except they have perfect knowledge of
them, in regard they have been many times, by several nations, surprised,
taken and carried away; but upon some knowledge they will resort to the shore
near unto us, and bring with them Beeues, Goats, Hens, and abundance of
Bonanos, in the West Indies called Plantanos, a most excellent good, and
wholesome fruit; likewise of their Country pease, and other grain, and in way
of Tradesome hides: they there alone have the domination, their Kings and
Governors being their seated, as in the upper parts, of whom especially my
discourse is intended, howbeit for the more playner proceeding, I must break
of a while from them, and acquainte you first, of another sort of people we
find dwelling, or rather lurking, amongst these Maudingos, only some certain
way up the River.

And these are, as they call themselves, Portingales, and some few of them
seem the same; others of them are Molatoes, between black and white, but the
most part as black, as the natural inhabitants: they are scattered, some two
or three dwellers The vagrant Portingall.
in a place, and are all married, or rather keep with them the country black
women, of whom they beget children, howbeit they have amongst them, neither
Church, nor Friar, nor any other religious order. It does manifestly appear,
that they are such, as have been banished, or fled away, from forth either of
Portingall, or the Isles belonging unto that government, they do generally
employ themselves in buying such commodities the country affords, wherein
especially they covet the country people, who are sold unto them, when they
commit offenses, as you shall read where I write of the general government:
all which things they are ready to vent, unto such as come into the river, but
the black people are bought away by their own nation, and by them either
carried, or sold unto the Spaniard, for him to carry into the West Indies, to
remain as slaves, either in their Mines, or in any other servile uses, they in
those countries put them to: Some few of these sorting themselves together, in
one time of the year, have used to go up this River, in a boat or small
bark, as far as Setico, and there to remain in trade, from whence it is
certainly known they have returned much gold, above which place they never
attempted, which is not half the way, we have already gone up, since our
trading there. With these, in their places of dwelling, we are very
conversant, notwithstanding, we received such a horrible treachery from them,
as is set down in my beginning, in regard they tell us, those that were the
Actors thereof, are banished from amongst them, as being hated and detested for
the fact. Howsoever, we hope, and desire it may stand, for all our Nations
warning, never to let them have the like occasion, but believe, ever they will
do as they say, in telling An especial Caveat.
us they do love and wish us well, provided they may never have us under their
power, to be able to do us ill, which it behooneth us to take especial care
of.

The conditions they live subject unto, under the black Kings, makes it
appear, they have little comfort in any Christian country, or else themselves
are very careless what becomes of their posterity; for whenever the
husband, father, or master of the family dies, if he be of any worth, the
King seizes upon what he has, without respect, either to wife, children, or
servant, except they have warning to provide before, or are capable of
themselves, to look out for the future time; whereby we find in some those
few places we trade with them, poor distressed children left, who as it were
exposed to the charity of the country, become in a manner naturalized, and as
they grow up, apply themselves to buy and sell one thing for another as the
whole country does, still reserving carefully, the use of the Portingall
tongue, and with a kind of an affectionate zeal, the name of Christians,
taking it in a great disdain, be they never so black, to be called a Negro:
and these, for the most part, are the Portingalls, which live within this
River, who since they see we have followed a trade, and begun to settle upon
it, in regard they much doubt, we wait but an opportunity (as they say
amongst themselves) to have a valuable satisfaction, for the wrong their Nation
began with, knowing the Englishmen do not ordinarily digest such horrible
abuses, it has made such as were of worth, and dwelling upon the coast, who
were wont to look into the River, forbear that recourse, and also those,
that were of the best and most ablest estates, to quit their dwellings, and to
seek out elsewhere, leaving none but a few poor snakes, who for fear,
rather then love, offer themselves, to do us any manner of service: which fear
of theirs, is the more increased, because the natural black people, out of
their moral understanding, and were some of them spectators of their bloody
murder, the ship then riding before the Town, when the fact was done, and
by them rightly understood, to be treacherously done in betraying our faithful
trust, contrary to the great protestations and obligements before these
inhabitants made and confirmed, did not only utterly disallow of the fact, but
exclaiming against them, caused them to forsake their dwellings in that Town,
neither have they at this time any habitations there, notwithstanding they had
had continuance for many years before.

And further, when some of our people, who were above in the River, not knowing
of this evil accident, and were upon occasions returning to The courteous usage
of the natural inhabieants.
the ship, whom they found so miserably lost, and carried away, the people of
the Town, especially some principal, and most powerful men, took such
compassion upon them, that they fed them, and lodged them, with a great deal
of loving care, and that for no small time, until they had devised and
concluded amongst themselves, what course to take; and having resolved, to take
a tedious journey by Land, in seeking to cross the country to the Northward,
until they came to Cape de Verde, where they were fure to meet with shipping,
they not only fitted them, with such necessaries as they could, but also fent
of their own people, as guides with them: and being in that manner commended
from one King to another, were lovingly entertained, lodged, and fed, and with
new guides still conveyed, never leaving them, until their desire was
satisfied, and they safely arrived, where they found convenient shipping, and
still the commendations that went along with them, from one black King to
another, was, in regard their ship was betrayed, and taken away by the
Portingall, whereby they found such compassion, that in some places they had
horses to ride on, and in other places were entreated to rest, and recreate
themselves, longer then they were willing.

And thus much is said, for those people of the country, amongst whom the
Portingalls dwelt, had their aboade, and all familiar commerce; but for those
black people who are dwelling above in the River, where these Portingalls
never had any habitation, only as I said, a trade, in their boats up some
part of the River, and amongst whom we have settled our selves, with great
league and testification of much amity (as I must deliver when I come unto
them,) these I say, when there was only five of our men dwelling amongst them,
their houses seated by the River side; and that ceraine Portingals, in a
smalbark or Boat, were to pass by them in following their Trade to Setico,
being a matter of some 16 leagues, above the place our men lived at: these
people when they saw our men make ready their arms, and prepare their pieces,
to standon their guard, being so sew of them, not daring to trust the
Portingals flattering promises, did not only put themselves in companies for
their defense, but likewise animated our men, to set upon them, promising if
they would give the ou-set, they would prosecute it, to the confusion of all
and every man of them, in the same manner, as they before had dealt with us,
with great vehemence pressing them, as a thing they were especially bound to
do, which our men refusing they inthemselues did carry toward them a kind of
sullen, and insolent behavior: so as their bloody act, wherewith they thought
to daunt, and discourage us, in seeking or following of any trade here, and
more securely to settle themselves, has no doubt, (by Gods providence) if it
be carefully considered and dilligently observed, by a timely The reward of
treachery.
following of what does offer it self, turned to the clean contrary, and
through their own guilt, enforced them to avoid the place, leaving it of
their own accords, whereby if we embrace the occasion, many good and
profitable ends may be made, and this have I truly related: the Portingal,
who as he sees we prepare with earnestness, to follow this Trade, with the
like earnestness, will prepare to leave the River, which preparations as I
hope and desire, may speedily and earnestly in our Countries behalf be under
gone, and followed, so in his preparation I would be no hinderer, but think it
a fair riddance, of a false friend, and so I leave him.

The wandering Fulbie.
THere is one people more, dwelling and abiding among these Maudingos, and
under their subjection, of whom it is necessary for me to speak, before I come
to the principal. These are called Fulbies, being a Tawny people, and have a
resemblance right unto those we call Egiptians: the women amongst them, are
straight, upright, and excellently well bodied, having very good features, with
a long black hair, much more loose then the black women have, wherewith they
at ire themselves very neatly, but in their apparel they go clothed and wear
the same habit, the black women do; the men are not in their kinds, so
generally handsome, as the women are, which may be imputed to their course of
lives; whereof I proceed to tell you; Their profession is keeping of Cattle,
some Goats they have, but the Herds they tendare Beefes, whereof they are
abundantly stored: In some places they have settled Towns, but for the most
part they are still wandering, uniting themselves in kindred and families, and
so drive their herds together; where they find the ground and soil most fit
for their Cattle, there, with the Kings allowance of the Country, they sit
down, building themselves houses, as the season of the year serves, and in
such places as lies most convenient, for preservation of their Herds they
look unto: during the times of the raines, they retire to the mountains, and
higher grounds, and again as they grow dry, and barraine to the low plains
and bottomes, even to the River side; that in the times of our chiefest Trade,
their cattle are feeding by us, and the women with their commodities daily
customers to us. These men's labor and toil is continual, for in the day
time, they watch and keep them together, from straying, and especially from
coming to near the River, where the Crocodile does hauur, and in the night
time, they bring them home about their howses, and parting them in several
Herds, they make fires round about them, and likewise in the middle of them,
about which they lie themselves, ready upon any occasion to defend them from
their roaring enemies, which are Lions, Ounces, and such devouring beasts,
whereof the Country is full, as when I speak of them will be perceived.

This is the poor Fulbies life, whereunto he is so enured, that in a manner he
is become bestiall, for I have noted diverse times, when we have come up in the
morning, before his Cattle had been dispersed, or gone to seed, when we have
called for the Mr, or chief of them, to make a bargain for a beef, or
beeues, as we had occasion, he would come unto us, from forth the middle of
the heard, and those parts of him which were bare, as his face and hands, but
especially his face, would stand so thick of flies, as they use to sit in the
hot Summer time upon our horses, and teemes here in England, and they were the
same manner of fly we have, which the Fulbie would let alone, not offering to
put up his hand, to drive them away, therein seeming more senseless, then our
Country beasts, who will wiske with their tails, and seek any other defense,
to avoid or be rid of them, but for our own parts we were feign, during our
parley with them, to ho'd a green bow, to beat of the fly, finding his stay
never so little, very offensive. These people live in great subjection to the
Maudingo, under The misery of the Fulbic.
which they seem to groan, for he cannot at any time kill a beef but if they
know it, the blackmen will have the greatest share, neither can he sell or
barter with us for any commodity he has, but if it be known the other will
be his partner, in so much as when the men come unto us, they will watch the
blacke-mans absence, or hiding their commodities, draw us covertly to see it,
that they may have their return private, and not stick many times, when he
knows the other out of hearing, to speak many disdainful words against him:
And of these people the Country is very full, being dispersed and spread in such
manner of families, as I said before, over the whole Country; and higher up in
the Country, as we here, and I shall show hereafter, they are in on part
principal, and have excluded the Blackes, holding domination amongst
themselves, and for the most part continually in war. The language the Fulbie
speaks, is different from the black-men, the women are our chiefest customers,
for in most places, within the ebbing and flowing, where we did lie for Trade,
we should be sure to have their custom every day, which was to bring us new
milk, sour milk, and curdes, and two sorts of butter, the one new and white,
the other hard and of an excellent color, which we called refined butter, and
is without question, but for a little freshnes, as good as any we have at home:
all which they brought unto us, in great and small gourds like dishes, made up
very handsomely, and one thing let me not forget to give them due praise in,
that in what someuer you received from them, you should have it so neat and
clean that in your milk you should not perceive a mote, nor in her butter any
vncleanlines nay the gourds, ordishes, they The cleanelines of the Fulby women.
brought it in, on the very outsides would shine with cleanliness, and one the
inward parts, without any nastinesse, and if at any time, by any mischance,
there had been a mote, or hair, which you had showed unto her, she would have
seemed to blush, in defense of her cleanely meaning.

In noting of which, I have diverse times said, there was great difference
between them, and the Irish Calios, although their manner of lives had great
resemblance in following of their Cattle, and as they were out of heart in one
ground, to remove whole Towns together, which but few years since was the
Irish Kernes true course of life; but-with cleanliness your Irish woman has
no acquaintance, and therefore I return back to my Tawny Fulbie: the
commodities she asked for were small beads, and poor knifes of 16 d a dozen,
with other trifling things, but after they once saw and vasted of salt, which
in their language they called Ram-Dam, there was no other thing could so well
please them, although it were never so little; we found the variety of these
things many times agreeable to our natures, and therefore gave fair recourse
unto the people, for if we denide but one day to buy of them, we should want
their company a week after, what earnest occasion someuer we had to use them;
and these things were to be had from none but them, because the Maudingo, or
Blacke-man applies himself, at no time, in keeping or preserving of Cattle,
but leaves it to this painful Fulby, whom I likewise leave looking to his
Herds, and come to the commanding Black.

The Maudingo or Ethiopian, being the natural Inhabitants, distinguished by
the name of the Maudingos.
THe people, who are Lords, and Commanders of this country, and profess
themselves the natural Inhabitants, are perfectly black, both men and women.
The men for their parts, do live a most idle kind of life, employing
themselves (I mean the greater part) to no kind of trade nor exercise, except
it be only some two months of the yeate, which is in tilling, and bringing
home their country corn, and grain, wherein the preservation of their lives
consists, and in that time their labor is sore, as when I come to show the
manner, you may easily conceive; All other times of the year, they live
wandering up and down, from one to an other, having little understanding,
either to hunt in the woods, or fish in the waters; notwithstanding, both the
one and the other, in their kinds, are infinitely replenished, that to their
very doors wild beasts do resort, and about their houses in every corner,
abundance of Ginny hens, and excellent partridges. In the heat of the day,
the men will come forth, and sit themselves in companies, under the shady
trees, to receive the fresh air, and there pass the time in communication,
having only one kind of game to recreate themselves withal, and that is in a
piece of wood, certain great holes cut, which they set upon the ground betwixt
two of them, and with a number of some thirty pibble stones, after a manner of
counting, they take one from the other, until one is possessed of all, whereat
some of them are wondrous nimble: we do perceive amongst them, that the
ordinary people eat but one meal a day, and especially the younger sort, of
what kind soever; their hour of feeding The time and manner of the peoples
feeding.
being only aster the day light is in, and then with fires of Reeds, without
the door, they sit them round, and fall to their viands, which for the most
part, is either Rice, or some other grain, boiled, which being brought unto
them by the women in goardes, hot, putting in their hands, they roll up into
balls, and cast into their mouths, and this is their manner of feeding: they
do seldom eat either flesh or fish, the rather because they cannot get it,
then out of any will to refuse it: and although they are great breeders of such
very poultry, as ate our Cocks and Hens, and have understanding to cut
Capons, yet they are great sparers thereof, and preserve them to sell unto us,
for small pieces of Iron, beads, and such like commodities, whereof if we be
furnished, we can want none of that provision.

They will say, their feeding so seldom, is a great preservation of their
healths, and at that time, when the Sun is down, a fittest time for
nourishment, avoiding especially, to eat in the heat of the day, as a thing
wonderful unwholesome, wherein it may please you to give me leave to utter my
opinion, which happly coming to be scanned by A digression, by the Writer, for
the better preserving of men's lives and healths.
men of knowledge, may produce some rules of better order, then has
hither-unto been kept amongst our Nation, which has caused the loss of so
many lives, and the dangerous sickness of others, therewithal laying a
general scandal upon the country it self, to be both infectious, and
unwholesome for our bodies, whereas indeed it is our own disorders: For the
custom that has been hither-unto held, especially into this River, has
been without any diligence, to make choice of such Seamen for governors, as
were men of temperance, and command, who being able to temper well themselves,
might the better govern the rest, whose ill carriages may be thought to be
great prouokers for shortning other men's days: I will example it in this last
voyage of ours. The Master was a man known, for an excellent Artsman, but in
the government of himself, so far from knowledge, that after our passage
from Dartmouth, which was in October, until the middle of March after, about
which time he dyed, it will be justified, he was never twenty days sober, in
which time he went not alone, but our Surgeon, with sundry other officers
that were of his society, with their lives paid for their riotous order. And
further, whereas we were divided into two shallops, to go up the River, the
bigger whereof, the principal Factor was to follow his trade in, and carried
therefore in the same a Butte of Sack, and a Hogges-head of Aqua vitae, making
choice of such men as were the most able, and likeliest bodies to hold out, and
he in himself careful enough, as his experience might well advise him, having
spent many years, and made many voyages upon that continent, to observe both
his diet of eating and drinking; yet toward his people, he carried at
sometimes, such an ouer-sparing hand, that they fell to practicing how they
might deceive him, making use of all advantages, to steal those hot drinks
from him, which being purchased, as it were from his niggardly nature, they
would divide as a spoil with great greediness amongst themselves, and
thereby wrought their own confusions, that of those people he carried with
him, they either died before he came back to the ship, or shortly after,
some two at the most excepted, who escaped with dangerous sickness, whereas
to the contrary (with thankfulness to God be it spoken) my self going up in
the other shallop, and wherein I must take such men as were given me, not such
as I desired, observing amongst our selves, a loving and orderly course of
diet, wherein every man had his equal share, notwithstanding I went one
hundred and forty leagues above the other shallop, returned without the loss
of any one man; nay, in all my going to the highest, and in my return to the
Pinnace, I never had any man sick, but upon a second return up some part of
the River, some of my old men being changed, two or three fell sick, howbeit
(with comfort be it spoken) there was not one man died that went with me, and
for my own part, through the whole voyage, I was never one quarter of an hour
sick (blessed be the name of God.)

Now for my opinion concerning our diet, I hold well with the Blacks, that to
feed at noone, is an unwholesome thing, for that the Sun, being then in his
extremity of heat, and by his neerenes having such power over us, the
moisture that lies within the body, is exhaled to the exterior parts, to
comfort, The Writers opinion concerning diet.
and refresh that, which the heat does dry, and then are the interior parts
most cold, and unapt for nutriment, wherein experience makes us see, that in
the height and heat of the day we can with great facility, and without
offense, drink off such a draught, or quantity of Aqua vitae, or hot waters,
as if we should drink here in our native country at one time, would
certainly burn out our hearts; nay more, we find our bodies naturally
desiring, and longing for the same, (wherein I might here The Cauneat must be
looked carefully to, in the setting forth.
show some reason, partly to blame a neglect in our own provisions, but that I
assure my self, it has been rather ignorance, to know what was good, then
want of will to provide it) whereas in the cool of the morning, and again in
the evening, we receive it with much more temperance, and a little gives
satisfaction, so that my conclusion is, that to us that have able, and working
bodies, and in our occasions are stirring, and laboring in the morning early,
and after the heat of the day, are the fittest and conuenientst times to
receive our sustenance, wherein I shall ever submit my self to those of more
able judgment; and returning to the Blackes, let you know, that their usual
and ordinary drink, is, either the River water, or from some Spring, howbeit
they have grown from trees, several sorts of wine, or drinks, as also the
making of a kind of liquor they call Bullo, made and compounded of their
country corn; whereof more conveniently elsewhere I shall effectually
satisfy you: and now go on to show you, the manner of their building, and
fortifications.

They place themselves in their habitations round together, and for the most
part have a wall, though it be but of Reed, platted and made up together, some
six foot in height, circling and going round their Town, with doors of the
same, in the night time to be orderly shut, some of the houses within their
walls, likewise are made of the same Reeds; The manner of their building:
but the better sort do build the walls of their houses, of loame, which after
it is tempered, and laid up together, carries a kind of red color with it,
and does remain with an extraordinary hardness, that doubtless (as I have
carefully diverse times observed) it would make the most excellent and durablest
Brick in the world, the whole country, except upon the mountains, yielding
the same earth, whereof I will not forget to report one thing, which (in my
opinion) deserves admiration: we do find in most places, hills cast up by
Ants or Emmets, which we here call Ant-hills, some of them twenty foot of
height, of such compasses, as will hold or Strange Antehils.
contain a dozen men, which with the heat of the Sun is grown to that
hardness, as we do use to hide and conceal our selves in the ragged tops of
them, when we take up stands, to shoot at the country dear, or any other
manner of wild beast; the form of their houses, whether it be loame, or Reed,
is always round, and the round roofes made low, ever covered with reeds, and
tied fast to rafters, that they may be able to abide, and lie fast, in the
outrageous winds and gusts, that come in the times of rain; for which purpose
also they build their houses round, that the wind may have the lesser force
against them; and the walls enclosing and keeping them in, is to avoid those
ravening and devouring beasts, which in the night time range and bustle about,
wherewith diverse times notwithstanding, they are much affrighted, and by making
fires, and raising cries at midnight, to chase and drive them from their
mansion dwellings. This for the meaner Towns or country Villages, but they
have likewise Towns of force, according unto the manner of war, they use
amongst them, fortified, and trencht in, after a strong and defencible nature;
whereof (they say) the country within is full, especially where the Kings are
seated, the manner whereof we have seen in some two or three places, whereof I
will instance only one: which is the Town of Cassan, against which (as I said
before) the ship which was betrayed did ride, and we in our last voyage, did
make it our highest port for our bigger ship. This Town is the Kings seat,
and by the name of the Town he holds his title, King of Cassan; It is seated
upon the Rivers side, and enclosed round near to the houses, with hurdles,
such as our shepherds use, but they are The town of Cassan with the manner of
fortification.
above ten foot high, and fastened to strong and able poles, the tops whereof
remain above the hurdle; on the inside in diverse places, they have rooms, and
buildings, made up like Turrets, from whence they within may shoot their
arrows, and throw their darts over the wall, against their approaching
enemies; on the outside likewise, round the wall, they have cast a ditch or
trench, of a great breadth, and beyond that again a pretty distance, the whole
Town is circled with posts and pieces of trees, set close and fast into the
ground, some five foot high, so thick, that except in styles, or places made
of purpose, a single man cannot get through, and in the like manner, a small
distance off again, the like defense, and this is as they do signify unto us,
to keep off the force of horse, to which purpose, it seems to be very strong
and available; considering what arms and Weapons they have in use, which in
this place is necessary to be known.

They do usually walk, with a Staff or Iauelin in their hands, which they
call an Assegie, being a Reed of some six foot long, the head whereof is an
Iron pike, much like our Iauelines, but most of them very artificially made,
and full of danger; others they have also made, to throw like Irishmens darts,
with heads all barbed, full of cruelty to the receiver: each man likewise,
about his neck The arms or weapons the people have in use.
does wear, in a Bandeleere of red or yellow cloth, a short Sword of some two
foot long, with an open handle, which Swords they make of the Iron is brought
unto them, as you shall hear when I speak of their Trades, and also the better
sort of them, do carry their bow in their hands, and at their back a case,
very artificially made, which may hold within it some twenty four of their
arrows, it is the smallest arrow used by any Nation, made of a Reed, about the
bigness of a Swans quill, and some two foot in length, there is fastened in
the end, a small Iron with a barbed head, all which Iron is dangerously
poisoned; the arrow has neither nock nor feather, but is shot from the bow,
which is also made of a Reed, by a flat string, or rather stick smoothed and
made even, and fastened to the bow, so that the bow and the string, are one and
the selfsame wood, whose force is small, and therefore the offense lies in
the poison, which near hand upon their cotton garments, may make an entry, but
to a Buffe Ierkin, or any other slight garment of defense, except it be very
near, can be little offensive: we have seen of them likewise on horse back,
the horses being of a small stature, bridled and sadled after the Spanish
fashion, each man having his Assegie in his hand, and upon the right side of
his horse a broad Buckler hanging; and this is all the weapon in use amongst
them.

The Kings house is in the middle of the Town, enclosed by it self, only his
wives several houses about him, to which you cannot come, but as it were
through a Court of Guard, passing through an open house, where stands his
chair empty, unlawful for any but himself to sit in, by which hangs his
drums, the only instruments of war which we see amongst them, neither are
these drums without daily employment, for this is their continual custom
every night after it seems they have filled their bellies, they repair to
this Court of Guard, making fires both in the middle of the house, and in the
open yard, about which they do continue drumming, hooping, singing, and
making a hethenish noise, most commonly until the day begins to break,
when as we conceive deadsleepes take them, by which means sleeping one The
inhabitans custom in the night.
part of the day, it makes the other part seem shorter, until the time of
feeding come again, otherwise it is done to that purpose in the night, to
fear and keep away the Lions, and ravening beasts from about their dwellings,
who are at that season ranging and looking out; for this manner of course is
held amongst them, not only in their fortified Towns, but also in every
particular village, and habitation, whereof sew of them is without such poor
drums they use, and if they be, yet they continue the custom, through hooping,
singing, and using their voices, but when it happens muslcke is amongst them,
then is the horrible din, as I shall signify when I overtake their fiddlers.

But first I am to meddle with matter of state, and acquaint you concerning
their Kings, and Governors, for so I have promised, the better to bring my work
together: In following of which, I shall entreat your patience to observe with
me, that the better to distinguish of their governments, I must divide the
Country by the River, that how soever the River trends, which in his windings
is surely all points of the compass, I shall always call that part, which
lies to the southward in our intrance, the southside, and the other the
northside, of both which sides, although we have seen diverse petty Kings, and
other Commanders, to whom we paid a kind of poor custom, which in the mouth
of the River, where the Portingall has used, is not only greater, but
perremptorily demanded, whereas above it is less, and rather taken as a
courtesy presented, which moral kindness requires all strangers, coming in
the way of amity, to begin withal to a principal person, then any manner of
custom, that is (as we say) exacted, but how someuer both below and especially
above, it is of that poor quantity, it hardly deserves the pains of so long a
rehersall, whereby you may be drawn to conceit of a greater valuation: Those
petty Kings I say, where of I both saw, had conference, and did eat and drink
within six several places, who had the title of Mansa, which in their
language, is the proper name for the King, have all reference to their greater
Kings, who line farther from those places; on the southside, the whole Country

Kings we hard of, but saw none of them; the report going that they were such
as showed not themselves abroad, but in a manner of pomp, and that they were
not seen to hunt, but with great number of horse, and especially on the
northside, whereofdiuerse English have been eye witness; concerning Bursall,
whose continual aboode is near the seaside, These great Kings are likewise
tributaries to one great King fat ahoue in the land, as is reported to us.
whereby some recourse has been unto him, there is wars between the one
side of the River, and the other, and especially from this King of Bursall, in
so much as the people would tell us, if he could have any means to transport
his horse on the farther side, he would in short time ouerrunne great part of
that Country: the state of the great Kings, we may conjecture at, by the
obseruances those small ones we see, do assume unto themselves, and those
people they govern perform unto them, for there is no man, but at his first
approach before them, where they sit commonly in their houses, only upon a mat
which is spread upon the ground, but presents himself with a great deal of
reverence in kneeling on his knee, and coming nearer, lays first his hand
upon the bare ground, and then on the top of his own uncovered head, many of
them taking up the dust, and laying it upon his bare-head, which The reverence

deal of submission, he lays his hand upon the Kings thigh, and so retireth
himself a good distance back, and if it chance in any company or resort unto

down, and he falls to praying, the substance of his prayer, being for the
preservation of the King, and in the same blessing him, to which himself
crossing his arms, and laying his right hand over his left shoulder, and his
left hand, over his right shoulder, uses the word Amena, Amena, many times
over, which signifies the same as we say, Amen, or so be it: Nay more even
among the common people, when they meet in the high way, and are of
acquantance, having been absent from one another, any distance of time, if
there be a Marybucke amongst them, they put themselves into a round ring, and
before any salutation fall on their knees to prayer: The Kings respect unto
them again, is only nodding of his head, which is acceptably received, how be
it in manner of habit, there is between the King, and his people, little or
no manner of difference; which may be imputed to the necessity of the Country,
because it yields but one only material, to make apparel of, which is a
Cotton wool, whereof they plant great fields, and it grows up as it were our
rose bushes, yielding a cod, that in his full maturity, breaks in some part,
and shows a perfect white cotton, of which you shall find more written, when I
come to rehearse what trees and plants we find amongst them.

Now for the manner of their apparel, it is soon related, they being for the
most part bare-head, only bedecked or hanged over with gregory's, as they The

are likewise over their bodies, legs, and arms, which word I will presently
expound unto you, but first tell you their only garments are a shirt, and a
pair of breeches, their shirts made down to their knees, wide in manner of a
Sirplace, and with great sleaues, the which when he comes to use his bow or
arms, he rowleth up and it continues fast at the shoulder, his breeches are
made with so much stuff gathered just on his buttockes, that he seems to
carry a cushion, and after a manner makes him stradle as he goes, bare-legged,
and without shoes, except it be some few of them, who have a piece of leather
under their foot, cut like a shooe-sole, butned about the great toe, and again
about the instoppe. The Gregory's be things of great esteem amongst them, for
the most part they are made of leather of several fashions, wounderous neatly,
they are hollow, and within them is placed, and sowed up close, certain
writings, or spells which they receive from their Mary-buckes, whereof they
conceive such a religious respect, that they do confidently believe no hurt can
betide them, whilst these Gregory's are about them, and it seems to increase
their superstition; the Mary-buckes do divide these blessings for every
several and particular part, for upon their heads they wear them, in manner
of The description of their Gregory's, which are tharmes they receive from
their Mary-buckes.

below the elbow, so that in a manner, they seem as it were laden, and carriyng
an outward burden of religious blessings, whereof there is none so thoroughly
laden as the Kings, although of all sorts they are furnished with some, both
men and weomen, and this more I have taken notice of, that if any of them be
possessed of any malady, ot have any swelling or sore upon them, the remedy they
have, is only by placing one of these blessed Gregory's, where the grief
lies, which they conceit will help them: and for ought I can perceive, this
is all the Physic they have amongst them, and they do not only observe this
for themselves, but their horses do usually wear of these about their necks,
and most of their bows are hanged and furnished with them.

To countenance his state, he has many times two of his wives sitting by him,
supporting his body, and laying their hands upon his naked skin, above the
wast, stroking, and gently pulling the same, wherein he seems to receive
content, and because I have named two of his wives, before I proceed to any
thing else, I will acquaint you with the manner of their women, the
multiplicity of The number of their wives.
their wives, and the wonderful great subjection they live under. The King
has an orderly allowance of seven women, which are called wives; that is which
are esteemed, and acknowledged, and with a settled ceremony amongst them,
distinguished from other women which he has use of, being absolutely tied, to
attend his only pleasure, and therefore in relating of them according to our
proper phrase, can give them no other title but wife, of which it seems he
cannot exceed the number of seven: for he has the use of other women, who are
not of that esteem, but rather as we may term them Concubines, who are of a
lower birth then his wives, and these likewise are tied unto him, but Allowance
of other women for necessity sake.
not with that manner of strictnes the other are, so as it may appear, they
are rather taken for necessity then that it is a settled course amongst them,
which word necessity I must better explain, and therefore tell you, that it
may and does diverse times fall out, that of his seven wives he has none to
accompany him in the nature of a wife; For undoubtedly these people originally
sprung from the race of Canaan, the son of Ham, who discovered his father
Noah's secrets, for which Noah awakeing cursed Canaan as our holy Scripture
testifies, the curse as by Scholemen has been disputed, extended to his
ensuing race, in laying hold upon the same place, where the original cause
began, whereof these people are witness, who are furnished with such members as

of the two Sisters, Aholah and Aholibah, being charged with fornication, are in

they do bring and set it down upon the Matte before them, presently
withdrawing themselves, and are never admitted to sit and eat with them; nay I
can confidently affirm, that notwithstanding I have eaten sundry times, both
at the Kings, and other men's houses, where the men and we have put our hands
in a gourd and fed together, yet never could I see any woman allowed to eat,
albeit I have earnestly entreated the same, for amongst their many wives, there
is none of them, but have one especially accounted of, which has a greater
privilege by being about him, and more conversant then the rest, which by us
(though strangers) is easily discerned, and therefore amongst us we call her

think, there is hardly A strange report.
any Englishman can say, he ever saw the Blackeman kiss a woman. Again, which
is to be noted, notwithstanding this partiality of affection, and so many of
them of an equality living together, it is never heard, that they do brawle,
or scold, or fall out among themselves, how beit it may be thought in matter
that near concerns them, they cannot choose but have many aggreeuances,
contrary to our English proverb that says, Two women in one house, etc. but

I proceed again in the state of their Kings, there is no people in the world,

themselves, insomuch, as once I had a quarrel grew in my house, between one
of the Kings sons, under whose government our habitation was, and another

respects, we carried a more kind of extraordinary affection, wherein they

and parties making on both sides, danger was like to ensue, but calling more of
my company, with a small gunne I stepped betwixt them, and made them sever; how
beit the Kings son promised to return the next morning, and take revenge if
he durst abide him, which the other promised to do, and accordingly,
notwithstanding all the entreaties I could use, would not depart, but withal
sent out for more people, who in the morning betimes came into him, all of them
fitted with their country arms. And the Kings son also performed his word,
for in the morning he came to the Rivers side, and called for a boat to pass
over, bringing a live biefe with him, as a token unto me from his father, as he
was many times accustomed to send, and there came likewise with him diverse
people, and all with arms. I was very doubtful some hurt would arise, and
labored Boo John to go away: but all I could gain of him, was, he would only
sit down in our yard, under the shadow of our houses, with his people about
him, and if no wrong were offered him, he would not stir nor give no
offense; and by means I wrought so with the Kings son, carrying him and his
company into my house, and using them courteously, that for that time I
pacified them, and they parted quietly, howbeit not without threatening upon
another occasion; They do distinctly know every government, who shall be

them; with their great blood and dignity, whereof they so much eesteme: and
with one example I will rehearse unto you, I shall conclude concerning their
kingly privileges.

The King of Cassan, who was dwelling in the Town, as we came up the River,
with whom I spoke, drunk two or three bottles of Aqua vitae, and had much
familiar conference, who had lived in that place many years, howbeit he was a
lame man; after we returned down the River, and made stay at that Town we
found him nothing so merrily inclined, as he was at our going up: whereupon
demanding among some of the rest the reason, they told us, he was to be put
out of his kingdom; enquiring The deposing of Kings.
wherefore, they replied, there was another to come who had more right then
he, for said they, this was the Kings son, but begotten of a base woman,
such as I described their concubines to be: howbeit the King left behind him a
son, who was right borne, but very young, which child being now come to
years, craves his rightful inheritance, and the King of Bursall, under whom
they hold, they could not deny, but had taken order to send him forward, so as
he was lookd for every day, and indeed, the second day after I was gone from
the Town, he came thither, bringing abundance of people with him, to whom the
people of the Town resorted, leaving the old King, to whom notwithstanding the
young King sent, willing him to depart, and go away with his wives and family
before he came, or if he^ found him there, he should suffer death, which at
the first he refused to do, saying he would enclose himself in his dwelling,
and die there: but upon better advice, when he savv himself quite forsaken, he
passed himself and wives cross the River, and left the Town to this young
Commander, who after his entrance, our pinnace riding there, and being ready to
come away, he sent for the Factor, to whom after some familiar conference, he
said, this town and kingdom has been lost, but hereafter you shall see it
found again, promising at all occasions his friendly assistance.

But before I leave them, it were necessary I should acquaint you, what manner
of ceremony does pass betwixt them and us as we meet together; the King is
commonly sitting on his mat, laid on the ground, which in our entrance he
observes, not offering to rise; and in regard he has nothing but his Gregory's
on his head, which are fast and cannot stir, We do not use to move our
hatts, or uncover our heads when we come to him, but dravving near, The
ceremony used betwixt the King and us, when first we meet.
somevvhat bending our bodies, we lay our bands upon our breasts, which he
also performs to us, and when we come near, he holding forth his hand, we
first take hold on the upper part of one another hand, next on the lovver
part, and the third time join palms, and with a full hand shaking one
another, down we sit by him, and after some small parlee concerning the cause
of our coming, wherein the kings part is performed in state, whatsoever he
speaks being related over by another: out goes our bottle of Aqua vitae which
must not be wanting, and a botle of Sack too, it is so much the better, and
calling for a small gourd to drink in, which is their richest Plate; I first
begin, and drinking off a cup, present both the cup and bottle unto the king,
the botle he delivers presently to some one of principal regard with him, who
by his appointment, after the king has first drunk, and he himself not
failing of his next turn, distributes it to the whole attendance, who for the
most part stand round by the wall of the house, one after another taking his
cup, and then to the king again. In their drinking I observe one thing, that
in regard of the goodness or the strangeness of the liquor, when he receives
He gives his chief Gregory drink first.
the first cup, before he drink himself, with the same liquor, he wets one
of his principal Gregory's: The king many times calling for a cup, breaks the
square, otherwise they never leave until the bottle is out, and so all the
bottles we bring, wherein we have one privilege, for after we have tasted the
first cup, which must be of every botle to secure them of danger; we need not
unless we please, take any more, Their women not allowed to drink in public,
although they love it well.
but shaking of our heads when they offer a cup, it stands for a fair
refusal, and so passes to another; neither do they suffer their women
publicly to drink amongst them, except some especially respected, who may
sometimes have a cup, but even divide it among themselves, so long as the
bottle will run, and their brains hold out, which being the true and proper
element, they delight in, I will here in in their hearts desires leave them,
and proceed to a more civil; I am sure soberer sort of people.

The discourse of their Maribuckes or religious men.
ANd so by order, I am now come to speak of their Marybuckes or Bissareas,
which we in our language, may call religious Persons, or Priests of the
country. The Mary-buckes are separated from the common people, both in their
habitations and course of lives, concerning whom I have with diligence They
observe the leuiticall Law.
observed, that in their whole proceeding they have a wondrous reference to
the leuiticall law, as it is in our holy Bible related; the principalls whereof
they are not ignorant in, for they do report And have great knowledge of the
old Testament.
concerning Adam and Eve, whom they call Adama and Evahaha, talking of Noah's
flood, and of Moses, with many other things our sacred History makes mention
of: their houses or dwellings are separated from the common people, having
their Towns and lands set out in several within themselves, wherein no common
people have dwelling, except such as are their slaves, that work and They

labor for them, which slaves they suffer to marry and cherish the race that
comes of them, which race remains to them, and their heirs or posterity as
perpetual bondmen; they marry likewise in their own tribe or kindred, taking
no wines, but the daughters of Mary-buckes, and all the children they have, are
nourished and bred up, unto the ceremonies of their fathers.

But for the number of their wives and women, they have the self course, that
I described before The Mary-bucks have the same allowance of women the Kings or
temporal people have.
among the Kings, and temporal people, in the like manner amongst them, every
man in his dignity, and precedence having more or less: wherein there is no
severed town but has a principal, sor better relation whereof, I will
declare unto you the town and place, where there especial, or, as I may say,
high Priest does dwell.

The Town iscalled Setico, lying from the River side some three miles: to this
Town I went, having occasion in following of our Trade, to lie with my boat
so near as I could come, my Guide or This Fodee Karcere was my Alchade, and
bought and sold for me.
Conductor, was one of my black people I hired, called Fodee Careere, who in
his profession was a Mary-bucke, and they are for our commodities to be hired,
and will put their hand to any needful occasion, like as any of the temporal
sort would do.

This was the first of the Country, who ever I entertained and continued with
me, both up into the highest part I went, as likewise all the time I followed
any trade in the River, with whom we do agree by the moon, how much he is to
have, which agreement he receives when the moon is ended, in some commodity of
ours which he desires, the valuation whereof, amounts unto a poor sum: our
continuance together, had bred such an affectionate league, between us, that
we were united as people of one place, and in those courses of trade we
followed, I did not only ask and require his advise, but in most things
allowed and followed the same: with that Mary-bucke, I had diverse and sundry
communications, concerning their Religion, wherein many times he would wish,
that I might once come to converse with their chief man, whom he called Fodee
Bram, who Fodee Bram was the chief Mary-bucke of all the Country.
would as he said give me full satisfaction, concerning their religious orders;
and being now come to the Port of Setico, for so we called it, he was very
importunate I should go up to see the town and visit this religious person, I
received his direction, what Present it was fittest, I should carry him up,
wherewith furnished, taking two of our men with me, one of them carrying a
fowling piece on his neck, we came to the town, but me ting of some of the
dwellers by the way, they had told us that this Fodee Bram was very il, and
dangerously sick, whereat they seemed much to mourn.

Being entered the Town, and come unto his house, I found without many people,
demanding Both Priest and people wear one manner of apparel.
of him what they were, he told me they were all as he was, Mary-buckes: for by
their habit they are not to be discerned, being all clothed in one and the
same manner, as the common people are: I was entreated to sit down under their
open shades, which are made by the better sort of people, on the outside of
their houses, to take the air in; and in the mean time my Alchade, for by
that name my hired Mary-bucke was called, went into his house, and in my name
presented my present, acquainting of him that I was the Captain, and Commander
of our people, whereupon he caused himself to be lifted up from his bed, or
mat whereon he lay, sitting on the side whereof, supported and held up by
three of his wives, he sent out to have me brought unto him, and after our
salutations past, he held me fast by the hand, giving me many thanks, for that
great present he had received, bemoneing much his sickness hindered him, he
could not accompany me, thereby to show his respect unto me, during our
conference he caused The chief Mary-bucke, daungerously sick.
a dinner to be made ready: I did conceit him to be daungerously sick, for
his hand wherewith he held me, did burn with that extremity, as the heat gave
such offense, that I wished very willingly I might be loosed; I took notice of
those women who held him, and to every of them gave a pewter ring, which both
from them, and him was thankefully received: dinner provided, he entreated me
with my Company: to pass into another house adjoining, which after their
Country manner was prepared, and we had Hens, and other provision brought in,

made up in round cakes, resembling very much our English Ielly, and as our
Alchard told me, was one of the principal dainties, esteemed amongst them;
while I was at dinner, a messenger came from him, bringing word he was very
sorry to hear I fed not, and likewise by him sent unto me a large hide, and an
Elephants tooth of a good bigness, as a gratuity for the present I had brought
him, (wherein may be judged what loss I received, when the valuation The

might thoroughly discern the whole Situation, I did heedfully regard it, for
it did appear the greatest Town, or place, that I had seen, and the manner
thereof in my opinion, was worthy the observation: The town was built round,
after the manner of a Circle, whereof the front of the houses, did not contain
any great thickness, but as we may say, the breedth of a reasonable fair
street, joining their houses or walls of their yards and barnes close
together, the diameter whereof, that is from the North, to the South, or
likewise from any one point to his opposite, we did conceive to be near an
English mile, within which Circute was much Cartle, especially store of Asses,
whereby it may be coniectured, that they contrived their town in that sort, to
keep out the ravening beasts, and securing those Cattle they had about them,
whereof at this place they had the greatest use, I mean of their Asses, as I
will relate unto you, but first I must take leave of the high Priest: after I
had satisfied my self in looking abroad, I returned un o him into his house,
where I found him laid along, in extremity of pain, he seemed to labor much
in his desire to have had conference with me, saying he had earnestly wished to
see me, that we might have spoken together, concerning our laws, and something
he spoke, but what came from him, was very imperfect, which I imputed to the
pain he endured, only I noted when he would have spoken of Adam and Eve, and
Moses, and so I took notice of the names, in that manner he might well
perceive, we had knowledge of them, he seemed to take pleasure therein, but the
conclusion The chief Mary-bucke wonderful desuous to confer with me about our
Religion.
with him, was to no purpose, nor worth rehersall: So that after he had made me
to eat by him, a dish of excellent cream dressed with corn after their best
fashion, and a solemn farewell past betwixt us, I left him. Not withstanding
before I proceed fur there, I will relate what I have gathered of their
profession, and what they conceit of us. They do worship the same as we do, the
true and only God, to whom they pray, and on his name they call, in their They

neither have they amongst them, any manner of image, or picture, or resemblance
of any divine things They have no manner of Image.
but as far as we can perceive, such things are distasteful unto them: They do
acknowledge Mahomet, and are all circumcised, the manner of their circumcision,
I refer to speak of in another place: their Sabbath or the seventh day is upon
the friday, and have distinctions, and proper names for seven days in their
week, they reckon their age or times, by the raines, in saying he has lived
so many raines, as we say so many years, howbeit, we do never hear them call
upon the name of Mahomet, neither have they amongst them any Churches, nor
places they dedicate to holy uses, so far as we can They have no Chuches.
perceive, neither do we find that they celebrate or solemnize them Sabbath
day, for even on that day will they follow any Trade, they will have with us,
and their own occasions: without any intermission, They observe not their
Sabbath.
they have certain round houses built open, and are spacious, according to
their fashions, wherein they teach their youth, the manner whereof is this: All

Character they use, being much like the Hebrewe, which in regard I understood
not, I caused my Mary-bucke to write in paper, some part of their law, which I
brought home with me, that some of our learned Scholars might peruse, if we
might by that means come to any better knowledge, then the small practice we
have hitherto had, and by Their law is not written in the public
men of our capacities cannot so easily be attained, only this much we
discern, that the religion and law they teach, is not writ in the same tongue,
they publicly speak, and moreover, that none of the temporal people, of what
dignity soever, are traded up to write, or read, or have any use of books or
letters amongst them. And whether these open houses, they teach their children
in, be places for their religious ceremonies, and for their public meetings,
in their holy exercises, because they are ever placed, near the principal
man's dwelling, and as it were joining unto him, we cannot well resolve, but
rather conceit the contrary, in regard they lie open, and are not swept, and
kept with any manner of decency, and therefore do rather think they make use
of the open fields, where under some spacious We suppose they perform their
religions ceremonies, under the shady trees.
shady tree, they observe their meetings, some part of the manner whereof, as
an eye witness, I will readily recite.

The place where we had houses built, and walled with straw for our own uses,
was seated by the River side, upon the top of the bank; and by the people of
the Country, called Tobabo Condo, the whitemans town: some hundred paces
within us, from the River, was a small town of these religious people, They
called our dwelling the white men's towns.
wherein lived an ancient Mary-bucke, called Mahome, who could not be less in
appearance then an hundred years of age, from whom we received much relation
concerning the country above, and of the abundance of gold there, which
himself had traveled and seen, as it is their profession to do, and I shall
have occasion forthwith to show you: This ancient Mahome, was ever a faithful
and loving neighbor unto us, howbeit in regard of his In any oecasion of
falling out between the people and us, this old man would come with his Assegy
presently to aid us.
age, he did not teach the children, nor was not the eminentest man of the
Town, but one Hammet, who was not so trusty a neighbor. The old Mahome did
diverse times lodge and entertain strangers, that came, especially of his own
profession, amongst which, there had lain one night at his house, a
Mary-bucke, who in the morning, coming down to the River side, close without
our wall; having his slaves to follow him, who brought in his hand a great
gourd, in the River he filled it full of saire water, and brought unto him,
whereinto presently pulling forth all his privy members, he put them,
without any niceness of being seen what he did, and after he had well washed
them, he made him to throw away the water; which done, and the gourd well
vvashed orrinced, he brought him another, filled also with water, wherein he
vvashed and rubbed his hands, and in the like manner it was thrown away, and a
third brought, wherewith he washed and cleansed his face, all which performed,
he making a kind of low reverence with his body, and laying his hand on his
breast, his face directed toward the East, kneeled down, and there mumbled or
uttered forth, after a decent manner, it should seem, certain prayers,
wherein, after he had continued for a space, kissing the ground, he Their

rose up, and turning himself about, with his face directed to the West, he
performed the like ceremony, which ended, after he had stayed, and looked a
while upon us, he returned to his place of lodging.

One ceremony more of their Religion, I will relate, if you please to remember,
where and how I left the chief Mary-bucke sick and full of danger, it did
manifest no less, for in the evening, the day after I came from him, he died,
the report whereof, was immediately spread over the whole country, The death
of the chief Mary-bucke.
who from all parts came in, after that abundant manner, to solemnize his
funeral, so many thousands of men and women gathered together, as in such a
desert and scattered country might breed admiration, which I think was rather

same together; the place or port whereat my boat did ride, was a Passage or
Ferry to the town, from the whole country, on the further side, whereunto
belonged a great Canoe, which I had hired, having likewise another of my own,
both which never stood still, but were used, night and day in passing the
people, none of them came empty, some brought beeues, others goats, and
cocks and henues, with rice, and all sort of grain the country yielded, so as
there came in a wonderful deal of provision, my Mary-bucke entreated me, to

esteem of; I sent some Spica Romana, and some Orras, which by his son was

set in the room, and just after the same manner, as the Irish do use, with
a vvonderfull noise of cries and lamentations, he was laid into the ground;
the people, especially the women, running about the house, and from place to
place, with their arms spread, after a lunaticke fashion, seemd with great
sorrovv to bewail his departure. They also assembled themselves, in the most
convenient place, to receive the multitude, and nearest unto the grave, and
sitting down in a round ring, in the middle came forth a Mary-bucke, who
betwixt saying and singing, did rehearse as it were certain verses, in the
praise and remembrance of him departed, which it should seem was done
extempore; Verses and Orations in commendations of the deceased.
or provided for that assembly, because upon diverse words or sentences he
spoke, the people would make such sudden exultations, by clapping of their
hands, and every one running in, to give and present unto him, some one or
other manner of thing, might be thought acceptable, that one aster another,
every several Mary-bucke would have his speech, wherein they only went away
with the gratifications, who had the pleasingest style, or as we term it,
the most eloquente phrase, in setting forth the praises of him departed, in
which the people were so much delighted; another ceremony was, that every
principal Mary-bucke and men of note amongst them, would take of the earth,
which came forth of the place his grave was dug, and with the same water,
which was in the pot, standing in the same room, would moysten the said earth,
and so form thereof a round ball, which they would A Relic of great esteem.

Mary-bucke, because of those perfumes I sent, was admitted to have one, which
he so highly esteemed, I could not at any rate purchase it from him, although I
made him offers, of more then I meant to give.

This Assembly held, for the space of ten days, with a continual recourse, of
coming and going, but not altogether for the burial of the dead; for after
certain days were spent in the celebrating of his Obsequies, then began a
great solemnity, for the establishing and inuesting of his eldest son in his
place and dignity: whereunto came again The inuesting of the eldest son in

was brought very far, his wool might more properly be called hair, it was
of that hardness: I did understand by my Mary-bucke, he was to be used, after
some manner of sacrifice, and I understood likewise, that in their high
Priesthood, the son succeeded the father, and this course is held amongst
their Religious orders, wherein they differ from the temporal gouerments.

It follows, I should now deliver their poor opinion they should concerning
us and our profession: wherein, with humble reverence, I crave pardon, that my
hand hold in the least sort, be made an instrument, to show or set down, any
thing opposite unto my Lord and Savior, but by showing the weakness of natural
man, and the wisdom that remains in rotten flesh, the glory of God more
perfectly appears, to the confirming and comforting of every true and perfect
established Christian; when we show unto them we honor and serve God above,
and likewise his Son, who was sent upon the earth, and suffered death for us,
who was called Jesus, by that name they do not know him, but by the name of
Nale, they speak They call Christ by the name of Nale.
of a great Prophet, who did many and great miracles, whereof they have amongst
them diverse repetitions, and that his mothers name was Maria, and him they do
acknowledge, to be a wondrous good man, but to be Gods son, they say it is
impossible, for say they God was never seen, and who can see God and live,
much more, for God to have the knowledge of woman, in that kind that we should
believe it, they do wonder at us; the rather they say, because they see God
loves us, better then them, in giving us such good things, they see we have and

they do admire our knowledge, being able to make such vessels, as can carry
us through such great waters, and how we should find our way, more especially
higher up in the River; when we talk of the Sea, whereof they are altogether
ignorant, only by the name, or word Fancassa, which signifies great waters;
thus like human creatures in darkness they argue, being barred from that
glorious light, which shines in the east, whreof though they have heard, they
have not yet made use but no doubt when the fullness of time is come they
shall; for amongst themselves a prophecy remains, that they shall be subdued,
and remain subject to a white people: And what know we, but that determinate
time of God is at hand, and that it shall be his Almighty pleasure, to make our
nation his instruments, whereof in my part I am strongly comforted in regard of
the familiar conversation we find amongst them, and the fair acceptance I
received: in the upper parts I attained, where I had a people came down unto
me, who had never seen white men before, with whom we traded with a fair
commerce, and some savor of a golden sequel: the relation whereof, will follow
very speedily: only it is necessary, I part not obruptly from my religious
company, and to acquaint you that they have great books, all manuscripts of
their Religion, and that we have seen, when companies of Mary-buckes have
traveled by us, some of their people laden therewith, many of them They have
books of great volumes all manuscripts.
being very great, and of a large volume, which travel of theirs, it is most
necessary I acquaint you withal, in regard from thence proceeds, a great
deal of intelligence we have, and I may not let pass one virtue of theirs,
the narration whereof, may make their intelligence somewhat more respected, and
in my poor opinion carry along a better esteem.

It may please you to call to mind, when I left the Kings in the midst of
their cups, I promised to show you a soberer people, which are these
Mary-bucks, betwixt whom and the temporal people, is a wonderful difference,
the rather in regard they live upon one and the same ground, the temperature of
the day being the same, wherein the desires of those common people, is for
Aqua-vitae, and hot drinks that they will many times pawn their arms, both
their bows and arrows, and swords from their necks sor that hot liquor, yea
many times their clothes from their backs, to satiat and glut their earnest
desires, which seem to us never to be satisfied: Now to the contrary the

men, or malekind, but likewise their wives and women, neither will or can at
any time be drawn to taste or receive any jot of this our comfortable liquor,
nay more, they will not suffer none of their children, not so much as the
little infant, who in the place we lived at, through daily recourse one with
another, were grown to such familiarity with us, that they would many times
steal from their homes, and come and hang about us, these small ones we might
not give any wine, no nor any manner of fruit as reasons, or sugar, or any
sweet things, without great offense unto the parents, and if he happened they

great displeasure, and although themselves were never so sick, and in those
times we would persuade them, how comfortable it would be unto them, we could
by no means prevail, to gain any manner of inclination toward it, for
example, as I was traveling up the River in my boat, upon some occasions our
people being in the water, and in the shallow, leading up our boat, a sudden
deepnesse, occasioned by a steep bank, brought them beyond their reaches, and
enforced them to shift for themselves by swimming: my Alchade or Mary-bucke,
being one of them, who could reasonably use his arms, was notwithstanding
taken in a whirle-poole, and in great danger of drowning, having been twice at
the bottom, A strange ex ample of abstinence.
but at the second rise, one of our men took hold upon him, and with help, we
presently got him aboard, being almost spent, and his senses gone, we earnest
to recover him, fearing the agony we saw him in, got rosa-solis to put in his
mouth, the sent whereof, as it appeared, made him hold close his lips, that
we gave him none, but within a while he came perfectly to himself, and as it
seemed retained the savor, so as he asked whether he had taken any or no: He was
answered no: I had rather (says he) have died, then any should have come
within me, although I am verily persuaded, the very favor refresht, and did him
good, wherein they have a great resemblance to the Rechabites, spoken of in the
thirty five Chapter of the Prophet Jeremy, who kept zealously the Command of
Ionadab their father, from whence these may be lineally descended, in regard it
is said they proceeded from Hobab, the father in Law of Moses, and Moses wife

soberness of their, being an evident sign, that they are always themselves:
To which I add, that as they do not love, we should promise them any thing,
but be sure of performance, so in any thing we can discern, we receive no
false reports, or untruths from them, They will tell no lies.
with which confidence, I go forward with the relation of their trade, and
travail.

which the whole Country is open before them, to harbor and sit down as night
or necessity ouer-taketh them, always disposing themselves to some Town
whereunto they are not ouerchargeable, but only to rest their bodies, in regard
we see them always carry provision for the belly with them, which we conceit

any denial, and although to us it is but a poor matter, in respect of the
Trade we have, much more what we hope and look for, to give unto them, or
amongst a whole company, a quier of paper, which cost three pence, yet to them

are at wars, and up in arms, the one against the other, yet still the
Mary-bucke is a privileged person, and many follow his trade, or course of
traveling, without any let or interruption of either side. Notwithstanding
there is none of these Mary-buckes but go armed, and are as completely
furnished, as any of the other people, and have the manner of use and exercise
of their weapons, in as ample manner as they have, where unto I think they are
rather invited, in regard of those wild and ravening beasts, the country is
stored withal, that upon any occasion, they may be able to defend themselves,
and offend their offensive enemies. To particularize herein I may tell you of

stood, who both of them would relate unto us, of infinite store of gold, which
they had seen the Country above to abound withal, wherein the more ancient
man, whom we found so loving a friend, would speak marvelous confidently,
howbeit he would tell us, there were a dangerous people to pass, before we
came unto them, and that the River was so full of trees, we should not be able
to get our boat along; and in token of fear, when I was to begin my journey
upward, and came in the evening to take my leave of him; taking my right hand
betwixt both his, he uttered over it, diverse unknown words, and ever and
anon, would sparingly spatter, with his spettle upon it, after which laying
his mouth close to my Old Mahome he ceremony at my going up

which his superstitious zeal being assuredly done in love, I did not
contemptuously refuse, because I was ignorant of any offense therein, but with
a friendly courtesy parted with him, and my return back was to him as
joyful; the other who was a more, or as I may say, most subtle fellow,
promised to be my guide along, and to pass in the boat with me, and thereby
wrought upon my willingness, to embrace his company, to the serving his own
turn, and getting from me many such gifts and courtesies, as otherwise The
subtilty of his neighbor Hammet.
he could never have attained, holding me in hand, he would meet me at a Port
above, but there deceived me, to my further trouble, and at our return
prevented, his cause was fear of the people above, which (God be praised) fell
out to the contrary, whereof forthwith it will fall right to tell you; only I
must first say something, concerning the great Town of Setico, and of the
trade they follow, with those same number of Asses, whereof before I told you.

The inhabitants here, who are all Mary-buckes, are the only people, who
follow a continual trade from their own houses down to the King of Bursall,
whose dvvellings (as you may remember) The trade and travail of the mary-bucks

is said to be by the Sea side; at which place, the Sea shore does naturally
yield great store of Salt, but it is a course and durty kind, insomuch as the
greatest part, which we have seen, and taken notice of, does rather look like
dirt, or Sea-coale ashes, then resemble the Salt we have in use, or make our
trade withal; to buy which they carry down, as their chiefest commodity, the
slaves or people of the Country, whereof the King of Bursall does Wherewith he
maintains his greatness.
make such profit, as it is supposed to be a principal of the reuenew,
wherevvith he maintains his greatness. This commodity the people do carry
likewise far up into the Country, for amongst themselves, we can perceive
they make little use thereof, so as their travel is long and tedious: the
return they make, is not discernd to be any thing but gold, and a kind of
Nuts they call Cola, which is in great esteem amongst them, thevertue whereof
I shall hereafter tell you: and for that it may be here demanded, what becoms
of the gold by them brought down, I will show you what by report is told
us; These Mary-buckes do hold an opinion, that after their death they shall
appear in another world, wherein this gold will be of great esteem, and
therefore strive to furnish themselves all they can therevvith, An ill opinion
of the Mary-buckes, to bury their gold.
which either in their life time, they secretly in the ground do hide, or by
their dearest friends cause to be buried with them, esteeming themselves
happiest, that can with greatest quantity be furnished: another use they make,
is, to buy from the Portingals, a sort of fair, long and square blew stones,
which stones their women wear about their middle, to keep them from bloody
issues, unto which they are generally subject, the occasion rising from the
men, as may be well supposed, if you but remember or call to your mind, after
what sort they are discribed, and this is seen, by that esteem A good
commodity.
the Portingalls make of that commodity which brings (as I observed) so great
a store and quantity of gold amongst them; other use within themselves they
have none, but that the women wear it hanging in their ears, in rings, and
pendants, made up with little Art, and as unhandsome workmanship. These people
of Setico were the most unwilling we should proceed in the search of the River,
of any other, not only telling us themseluesof many dangers, but at all towns
where we came, and amongst our familiars, had left their persuasions, if it
could have prevailed to discourage us; or whether they did verily think, our

attempted by any such vessel before, or as I incline unto, fearing we might
be hinderers to the Trade, they had so long followed, and whereunto they were
settled, being well provided with such numbers of Asses, as beasts of burden, to
proceed and follow the same, so as from them, we could get no comfortable
intelligence, wherein reason leads the way, that every man's profit is nearest
to himself; but as it shall please God, to encourage you the noble Governor
and Company, to prepare and settle your selves, with a serious resolution, to

follow the farther search of this rich expectation: These people of Setico, of
all other are the likeliest, and dvvell the most conuenientest, to be brought
to a more settled, and commodious trade, which will fall upon them with a
great deal less trouble, and infinite less travel, and vvithall be made
especial instruments of our good, whereunto as yet their gross understandings
cannot ascend, and ancient customs are harsh to be altered, how beit these were
the considerations that made me endeavor to settle a league with the high
Priest, and establish a perfect course of amity betwixt us: which course of
mine, I shall more boldly commend to your fair acceptance, when you shall see
it grounded upon the experience of my whole travel and trade in the River, and
after my discourse and conference with that great black Merchant Bucker Sano,
concerning whom and all my proceedings above, I now am come to make a full
relation.

Our travel up the River.
When I was come to Baraconda, which is the highest Town the River flovves
unto, and notvvithstanding all the discouragement I received, was absolutely
bent to proceed up the River, by means of Bacay Tombo, a principal man of
that Country, who brought me two beeues. I was furnished with two Blacke-men
more to go up with me, the one a Mary-bucke, the other Bacan The Mary-buckes
name was Selyman, the other Tombo.
Tombo his kinsman, who he said had lived at Tinda, which was the place we
aimed at, not to the Town it self, but to the mouth of a little River, which
was said to run near unto the place, and from thence fell into the maine
River where we were: Two Blacke-men I had before, that was my Alchade, of whom
I talked, and a pretty youth called Samgulley, who from the first coming of
George Samgulley a black boy.
Tompson into the River, had always lived with the English, and followed their
affairs, so as he was come to speak our tongue, very handsomely, and him I
used many times as an Interpreter: so as in all we had four Blacke-men, whose
help we could not miss, in regard we carried with us a small Cano, that was
ready at all times to put a shore: and when we came to an anchor, to fetch
wood, or any other provisions, as likewise to carry us ashoare, and bring
others to us, reserving our boat in the midst of the River, as a castle and
refuge for us.

Thus we being ten Englishmen, and these four Blackes, went the fifteenth of
January in the evening from Baraconda, and were going against the stream,
until friday the twenty sixth in the morning, which was eleven days travel,
wherein I desire to be rightly understood, that our labor was Eleven days
travel against the stream, wherein we wrought eighty eight hours.
about four hours in the morning, and four in the evening, so as our whole
time spent therein, amounted but to four score and eight hours, in which
time, our Sabbath day was observed, only two hours in the evening, whenas
my men carnestly entreated to be going: in which time we recovered within
half a league of the place or Rivers mouth, we intended to go unto, and
further we would not have passed, nor endangered our selves, and what we
carried into the little River, until we had made trial of the peoples
dispositions, and how they should stand affected to us; we met here with a
shole, as I have said in the description of the River, which stayed us we
could pass no higher; we concluded therefore in the afternoon, to send
away three of our Blacke-men, who were vvilling to go, directing them to
Buckor Sano of Tinda, to whom we sent a Present, and likewise I sent to the
King of the place, as the manner is; and gave our Blacke-men vvherevvithall to
buy them victuals, demanding of them when they thought we should expect
their return, they said Sunday night, wherein I speak after our own phrase:
and while they are traveling, it will be necessary I acquaint you, what were
the grounds or reasons we sought after this Buckor Sano, and labored to get
near to this Tinda, making more especial choice of him, then of any other man.

George Tompson, in his diligence, while he lived, hearing of diverse
Carauans, that past in the country, and went down to the King of Bursals
dominions for salt, had learned, that the only and principallest man that
maintained the greatest Trade, was that Buckor Sano, whose dwelling was at
Tinda, who maintained and kept too. Asses following that tedious travel.
Tompsons desire led him forthwith, to go find this Merchant, and in a pair
of Oars, as I spoke in the beginning, went up the River, and traveling some
way by land recovered Tinda, but found not his black Merchant, in regard he
was traveled higher into the Country, in the sale and uttering of his salt
Commodity: Thompson returned, but found his expectation so satisfied, in that
he had hard of the Moors of Barbary, and was come so near where they
frequented, that he talked of nothing, but how to settle habitations, and
fortefie the River to defend themselves, and keep out other nations; but
these his desires died in his unhappy end, and this was all our acquaintance;
which now I came to second, by sending unto this Buckor Sano to come down unto
the River to us, as the only man we were willing to sell, and commend our
commodities unto.

And by this time Sunday night is come, and none of my blackmen returned,

selves by staying any longer, in regard it was fallen out, as we were told
below, that they were a bloody, and dangerous people, and therefore those
people we sent up were murdered; and if we stayed our turns would be next, and
likewise that we had no flesh left, and our other provisions were very scanty.
I gave them content with fair words, that the place might be farther of then
they conceited, in regard we had been on the top of the mountains, and
could discern no likelihood, of Towns or habitations, of which we had had no
acquaintance, since we came from Baraconde, and in regard the Country about us

went out with two more, and killed a great and goodly beast, which was no
sooner brought down and cut out, and hanged to cool under the shady trees on
shore, but there appeared in sight three blackmen, the one was one of those we
sent, who had brought with him Buckor Sanus brother, and the King of Tindas
servant, and they came before to The return of one of our messengers.
see us, and what commodities we had, bringing word that the next day Buckor
Sano would be there himself; I had them aboard my boat, and made them
courteous entertainment, giving them some small commodities, and when the
evening came, we feasted with our Venison.

their bows and arrows with him, he showed no more at first, bowbeit within
two hours after, there were two hundred men and women come thither: he sat
down upon the bank under a shady tree: after a little stay, I went a shore to
him, and our salutations being past, I desired him to go aboard, whereof he
kindly accepted; and withal showed me a beef he had brought to give me for
the present I had sent him, diverse goats the people had Provision the people

doubt any more want of victual: He carried no more aboard with him, but two

will secure you on shore, he liked our drink so well, he sucked it in, and as
it seems not knowing the strength of it, took more then he would have done,
insomuch as he fell asleep, the people that came with him, in the mean time
cutting of reeds, made them houses, others fetching in wood, made fires every
where about them, so as it seemed a little town; Buckor Sano slept foundly
upon my bed by me in the boat, and in the morning complained of his head, and
this much I must justify in his behalf, that during He was but once
overtaken with our strong drinks.
the time we were together, he was never overtaken by drinking after, but
observed the course he saw we used, to take a small cup before meat, and
another after, and this ever gave him satisfaction: He desired to see all the
Commodities we had, which he liked very well of, and whereas we thought our
Iron would have been greedily desired, we found it not so, for they told us,
there was a people neighbors unto them who had knowledge to make it, howbeit
they were diverse times in wars together, but some of our Iron we put away, at
better rates then below, by one third, and might have done away all we had, if
we would have accepted of hides, which for the reason I shall presently show
was refused; howsomeuer this was the maine business, that after they saw our
salt, no other thing was esteemed amongst them, which at first seemed strange
unto them, forasmuch as they had never seen any of that fashion before: the
salt we had, was only bay salt, which after they put in their mouths, and
rasted, they would look up and cry, All, in token of the good esteem they
had of it; After two hours of the morning spent, my Merchant The great esteem

went on shore, keeping my gown about him, which when the evening shut in, the
night before I had put upon him, and in a manner of state, he went one shore

used to such kind of ornaments.

All that day he found himself so sick, after his drinking, that he told me

bodies, which he He offers women to sell unto us.
told me were slaves, brought for me to buy, I made answer, We were a people,
who did not deal in any such commodities, neither did we buy or sell one
another, or any that had our own shapes; he seemed to marvel much at it, and
told us, it was the only merchandise, they carried down into the country,
where they fetched all their salt, and that they were sold there to white men,
who earnestly desired them, especially such young women, as he had brought for
us: we answered, They were another kind of people different from us, but for
our part, if they had no other commodities, we would return again: he made
reply, that they had hides and Elephants teeth, cotton yarne, and the clothes
of the country, which in our trade we call Negroes Their commodities.
clothes: he was answered, for their hides, we would not buy, in regard our
boat was little, and we could not conveniently carry them, but if they would
bring them lower down the River, where our bigger vessels could come, we would
buy them all, but for their teeth, cotton, and clothes, we would deal for
them: so against the next morning, being Satterday, we had a house built by the
water side, open round about, and covered with reeds on the top, to shadow us
from the Sun: and A markethouse made a shorc.
this was our market house; when we came to trade, we asked which should be the
Staple commodity, to pitch the price upon, to value other things by, they
showed us one of their clothes, and for that they only desired our salt, we
fell to loveing and bidding upon the proportion, wherein we had such
difference, and held so long, that many of them seemed to dislike, and made
show, that they would go away, but after we concluded, there was no more
difference, every man bringing his commodities, our salt went away, and as they
dispatched, they likewise returned in companies together, and still others came,

principal we came for, but waited opportunity, and notwithstanding we saw it
worn in their women's ears, warning was given, none of our people, should take
any great notice of it, as a thing we should greatly desire, until occasion
was given, by Buckor Sano himself, who taking note of our guilt swords, and
some other things we had, although but poorly set out, with some show of gold
trimming, did ask if that were gold: he was answered, Yes: it should seem
says he, you have much of this in your Country: We affirmed the same, and
that it was a thing our men did all use to wear, and therefore if they had
any, we would buy it of them, because we had more use then they for it, you
shall have said he, what is amongst our women here; but if I did know you would

buy all things you brought: and if you would be sure to come still unto us, I
would not fail to meet you. And proceeding further he said: This Country
above does abound therewith, insomuch as these eyes of mine (poynting two of
his fingers to his eyes, as the Country manner in speaking is,) has been
four several times, at a great Town above, the houses whereof are covered
only with gold: we demanded of him, how long he was going, and coming
thither: he answered four Moons; we asked him, if he would carry some of us
thither, he answered: Yes, but they had enemies by the Buckor Sanos report of
gold and of the houses above covered therewith.
way, sometimes to fight with them, we showed him presently our gunnes, and
told him we would carry them with us, and kill them all, at which he seemed
to take a great deal of content.

the day appears, which is even at the Sun rising, (for so near the
Equinoctial, there is a short dawning, either before the Sun rises, or
after she sets) and continue traveling some three hours, then are they
enforced to rest all the heat of the day, some two hours before: he Sun
sets, going forward again, and so continue until night comes, whenas they
are sure to harbor themselves, for fear of wild beasts, except in some Moon

is spent in this iourning, yet the way cannot be much, if you consider the
manner of iourning, wherein leaving to speak farther, until I come to a more
ample application, I return again to Buckor Sano my black Merchant.

In our time of trading together, if it were his own goods he bartred for, he
would tell us, this is for my self, and you must deal better with me, then
either with the Kings of the Country or any others, because I am as you are, a
Iulietto, which signifies a Merchant, that goes from place to place, neither
do I, as the Kings of our Country do which is to eat, and drink, and lie
still at home amongst their women, but I seek abroad as you do; and therefore
am nearer unto you, neither was I unwilling Buckor Sano his subtle speech.
to answer somewayes his expectation, in hope I should better forward our own
ends. In our course of familiarity, after time I took some special note of
the blade of his sword, and a pair of brass bracelts one of his wives had
upon her arms, both which things did appear to me, to be such as might very
well be brought in their beginnings, either from London, or some other part of
this our native Country, I demanded of him where he had them, he made answer
there was a people used to come amongst them, whom they His declaration of the

called Arabecks, who brought them these, and diverse other commodities; we
asked what manner of people, he described the Tawny Moore unto us, and said
they came in great companies together, and with many Cammels: How acceptable
this report was unto me, may be coniectured by any such, who are seriously
inclined, to give a fair and just account of any such employments they are

and whose desires, with affection, labors the full satisfaction of the trust
imposed upon them;

This his relation made it certain, that these were the Moors of Barbary, the
discovery of whose trade and traffic, was the ground of this our being so
high in the river: we grew to question him, how near those people came to the
place we were now at, he answered, within 6 days journey there is a town

we asked again, what commodities they brought with them, he answered much salt

reason of a disaster that fell in the way betwixt me and my chief
interpreter, I was hindered from understanding diverse particulars, wherein

these were the principals I gathered, howbeit, another occasion fell, whereby I

follow; for the conueniency whereof, I must once again with your favor
return to a great company on shore, who expect their trade, for this our
conference with Buckor Sano, was aboard our boat at dinner.

The people who came unto us for the first four days were staide here, came
only upon that side our Merchant came; but one of our hired black men, spoke
unto me, to give him some paper, and beads to buy him, and two other
provision as they went, and they would go seek other inhabitants likewise who
dwell A people that neuersaw white men before.
on the other part of the River, wherewith furnished they went away, and two
days after returned, and brought with them diverse people, who in the like
manner, made them houses of Reeds, to harbor themselves under: These people
had never seen white men before; and the women that came with them were very
shye, and fearful of us, insomuch as they would run behind the men, and
into the houses to hide from us; when we offered to come near them: I sent
therefore into the boat for some beads and such things, and went unto some of
the boldest, giving them thereof into their hands, which they were willing to
receive, and with these courtesies imboldued them, that they soon became
familiar, and in requital gave me again, Tobacco, and fine neat Canes they
had to take Tobacco with: these women were the deepest, and largest printed

or other cattle, the grace whereof was the tail of the beast which remains
on the skin, did stick right forth upon the hinder part of the man's
buttocks, resembling the manner as the beast wore it, whereat those black men,
who were our hyrelings, would in scorn jest and deride.

The principal man of these parts, called Baiage Dinggo I had into my boat,
and curtcously used, demanding if he did not know of our being there, in
reguard we thought he might hear our gunnes, he answered they had hard the
noise, and were much amazed, supposing it to be thunder, being the more
fearful unto them, because the sound came that ways, it was not accustomed to
do: they were very desirous also to buy of our salt, and some of that little
store we brought they had; which the people on the other side did unwillingly
spare; we bought of them such commodities as the rest had, and wonderful
desirous they were we should come again unto them; the best of these women
likewise did wear in their ears gold, and many commodities the women asked
for, which we had not, but the men especially for salt: there was An
encouragement to search further up the River.
not so little, as 500. men and women, who came down on this side the river,
and it did plainly appear, both the one and the other side were of familiar
acquaintance, in regard they did pass in our Canoe, the one to the other, and
had neighbourly salutations together: and further we noted, that the natural
tongue there spoken, was another different language: yet all the better sort
did talk together in the same speech we brought with us, and is from the mouth
of the River; their familiarite did assure us that they had commerce together,
which was an encourager to the confidence I have of the rivers continuance, and
that they have the use of canoes above, to ferry over, in regard in These

river to our first acquaintance; to whom was come down the King of the
country, called by the name of the King of Ielicot; who was the immediate King
of that land whereon we kept our trade: I went on shore, entreating him to
come into our boat, and there we drank: I gave him a present which he
accepted, and brought him likewise a shore, The King comes unto us.

must be bestowed; they brought with them commodities to barter, in doing of
which, and looking upon us, they continued four days.

did diverse times send both fish and foul unto his wives, so did I likewise
unto the King while he remained by us, which we took with our hooks, and
killed with our gunne. Our manner was to go on shore, and either at the Kings

behind hand to let them hear our powder, and see our manner of marching;
wherein they took much pleasure, and commonly these evening sports, cost us a
quart bottle of Aquavita: which made their tongues freer, and their bodies
fuller of agility; wherein always they did strive to show a desire they had to
give content unto us: I may not omit one principal manifestation: some three
nights before we had finished all our occasions in this place, Buckor Sano

to the trust reposed upon him: I took it very kindly he would accept the
name, and to inuest him therein I took a string of Currall, and another of
Crystal, and put about his neck: he had likewise a small chain of silver
put upon him; then causing three gunnes to be shot off, with a cup of
Rosasolis drunk unto him, with a Buckor Sano made the white men's Alchade.

himself a certain distance off, made a speech unto him, the effect whereof
was, that that in regard we were staide, through want of water, from passing

Buckor Sano kneeled down upon both his knees, giving him thanks, and taking
from about his neck, the string of Currall, and the string of Crystal, which

our behalf, which he received and put about his neck: Buckor Sano still

into their ceremonious discourses, wherein because the night was far spent,
we were willing to leave them, and betoke our selves to our own Castle,

what he was, and they told me, it was a Marybucke, who did use to Ferambra,

within three miles of Tobabo Conda, the place where our habitation upon the

showed himself a faithful friend, in time of need unto him, and his company,
and likewise confirmed the same unto me, by diverse Courtesies, which past

whence he came, and he answered from Iaye, a town nine days travel higher in

said likewise, if we could have gone further up the River with our boar, many
people would have come unto us, and brought great store of gold; and to the

they have their chiefest trade; they do observe one set time and day, to be
at a certain place, whereas houses are appointed for them, wherein they
find no body, nor have sight of any persons. At this place they do unlade
their commodities; and laying their salt in several heaps, and likewise
setting their beads, bracelets, and any other commodities in parcells
together, they depart, and remain away a whole day, in which day comes the
people they trade vvithall, and to each several lays down a proportion of
gold, as he valewes it, and leaving both the commodity and the gold goes his
vvayes: the Merchant returning again, as he accepts of the bargain, takes
away the gold and lets the commodity remain, or if he find there is to
little left, diuides his commodity into another part; for which he will have
more, at the unknown peoples return, they take to themselves, where they see
the gold is gone, and either lay more gold or take away what was laid before,
and remains in suspense: so that at the Merchants third time, his bargain is
finished, for either he finds more gold, or the first taken away, and his
commodity lest, and this it is said, they have a just manner of trading and

to which is added, that the reason why these people will not be seen, is for
that they are naturally borne, with their lower lip of that greatness, it
turns again, and couers the greater part of their bosom, and remains with
that rawnesse on the side that hangs down, that through occasion of the Suns
extreme heat, it is still subject to putrefaction, so as they have no means
to preserve themselves, but by continual casting salt upon it, and this is the
reason, salt is so precious amongst them: their country being so far up in
the land, naturally yeeldes none. And this carries some appearance by what we
are able to say; for first out of our own experience we The people who bought
our salt had no use of it, but for sale.
find that these people, who trade with us for our salt, have for their own
occasions little or no use thereof, and being demanded what they do with it,
they do not deny to tell us they carry it up further into the country, unto
another people, to whom they do sell and vent the same: which still are good
inducements to follovv a further search, and therein to neglect no time, but
diligently to follovv the occasions already obtained, which is the love of
these people, who were held so dangerous, who were so earnest for our
coming again, and to hold a certain course of trade with them, which by us
was faithfully promised, wherein the Adventurers have this strong
encouragement, that if we should attain no further then amongst these people

convenient seat of residence to maintain a settled trade in, there can be no
opposition to gainesay it must be the greatest and gainfullest trade,
considering the short return that ever fell into our little Island: which
commending to your worthy consideration I will conclude my discourse of
trading, with the courteous farewell that past betwixt our black Merchant
Buckor Sano and us. They were earnest we would give a name unto the place we
traded in, that might remain as a memorial of of our being there, I called it

with us, with courteous embracings we parted, shooting off three gunnes for his
farewell, not forgetting the drinking of three or four cups, and so put him
on the shore: from whence by holding up his arms, he again saluted us, and
with his hopeful expectation to see us there again, I will let him rest, and
according to my course propounded fall upon a merrier company, which is their

they make or instruments they play upon, deserving to have a better title: and
may sort also reasonable well to the company, because at all especial meetings
their devil Ho-re makes on the relation whereof I proceed unto.

There is, without doubt, no people on the earth more naturally affected to the
sound of music then these people; which the principal persons do hold as an
ornament of their state, so as when we come to see them, their music will
seldom be wanting, wherein they have a perfect resemblance to the Irish Rimer

singing of Songs unto their music, the ground and effect whereof is the
rehearsal of the ancient stock of the King, exalting his antientry, and
recounting over all the worthy and famous acts by him or them has been
achieved: singing likewise extempore upon any occasion is offered, whereby the
principal may be pleased; wherein diverse times they will not forget in our
presence to sing in the praise of us white men, for which he will expect from
us some manner of gratification. Also, if at any time the Kings or principal
persons come unto us trading in the River, they will have their music playing
before them, and will follow in order after their manner, presenting a show of
State. They have little variety of instruments, that which is most common in
use, is made of a great gourd, and a neck thereunto fastened, resembling, in
some sort, our Bandora; but they have no manner offret, and the strings they

notes, having not above six strings upon their greatest instrument: In

countenance of those kind of distressed people which amongst us are called
Changelings; I do the rather recite this that it may please you to mark, what
opinion the people have of the men of this profession, and how they dispose of
them after they are dead: but first I would acquaint you of their most
principal instrument, Their chiefest instrument.
which is called Ballards made to stand a foot above the ground, hollow under,
and has upon the top some seventeen wooden keys standing like the Organ,
upon which he that plays sitting upon the ground, just against the middle of
the instrument, strikes with a stick in either hand, about a foot long, at
the end whereof is made fast a round ball, covered with some soft stuff, to
avoid the clattering noise the bare sticks would make: and upon either arm
he has great rings of Iron: out of which are wrought pretty hansomly smaller
Irons to stand out, who hold upon them smaller rings and iuggling toys, which
as he stirs his arms, makes a kind of musical sound agreeing to their
barbarous content: the sound that proceeds from this instrument is worth the
observing, for we can hear it a good English mile, the making of this
instrument being one of the most ingenious things amongst them: for to every
one of these keys there belongs a small Iron the bigness of a quill, and is a
foot long, the breadth of the instrument, The manner of this instrument

who dance without men, and but one alone, with crooked knees and bended bodies

clapping their hands together after the manner of keeping time; and when the
men dance they do it with their swords naked in their hands, with which they

there be any licentious liberty, it is unto these women, whose outward
carriage is such we may well conceit it: and this one especial note,

player, that when any of them die, they do not vouchsafe them burial, as
other people have; but set his dead corpse upright in a hollow tree, where he

will answer, they are a people, They are basely esteemed of, and being dead are

therefore they do so dispose of them: which opinion of theirs caused us to
neglect and especially in their hearing to play upon any Lute or Instrument
which some of us for our private exercise did carry with us, in regard if they
had happened to see us, they would in a manner of scorn say, he that played was
a Iuddy: The greatest resort of people, with the most abundance of these
Iuddies, is at their times of Cricumcision, wherein they observe one due
season, and for that I desire herein to give a full relation, I will follow my
discourse with what I saw, and as an eye-witnes am able to deliver.

I have set down before, where I report the manner of our going up the river,
that I carried with me four blackes; whereof the one was a boy, or young
youth, whom I call by the name of Samgully; who in reguard of his continuance
with George Tompson, and after him with the rest of our company, had learnd to
speak pretty Englis; and withal had taken such an affection toward us; that
he did seem even heartily to neglect father and mother, and his own home, in
his desires to follow us: he was about the age of 17. years, a straight
youthand of a handsome growth; yet was he not circumcised: how beit he should
have been the year before, but his absence with the white people, which was
some of our company, when the time of circumcision came, was the only cause he
mist cutting them: and this year he was to be circumcised, or else there was
some great penalty to light upon his friends, or danger to himself; which
appeared in their earnestness to keep him from going up with us;
notwithstanding, he was stolen beyond the town his friends dwelt in with us,
as far as our boat would go in two tides; and there ouertooke us his
mother: who on the shore made grievous The affection of Saingulley our black
boy unto us.
moan to have him sent back, the boy had spide her, and hid himself in the
boat, bidding us say that he was gone back, and albeit her moan was great,
because she said, he would be absent again in the time of circumcision,
which would be the next Moon; and if we would not put him on shore, she
would throw her self from the bank into the river; the boy lying along in
the boat, said, she will not drown, she will not drown, let us be gone;
and along he went with us: It was the eight day of January when his mother
made this moan, and the ninth day of February after we came by that place
again, and that evening, as the Sun set, came to an anchor at the port that
belonged to the town where the boys friends dwelt, which was called Boo John's
town, a man whom we did well affect: This Bo John was brother to Ferambra.
the town stood some mile from the water side to carry the boy home, and
refresh our selves, we were willing to walk on shore.

So taking our Surgeon, and one more of my consorts, with our black
Alchade, who we hired from this town, wherein his mother likewise dwelt, and
our black boy, ashore we went, the bakne was high from the river; which the
boy first gat up, where presently ascended, he began to leap and sing, making
great shows of joy, holding up his hand, and pointing toward the town, which
as I said was a The feast of their Circumcision.
mile from us: but when we likewise ascended, we heard a great noise of
music and shooting, where at the boy so much rejoiced, and said it was the
cutting of Pricks; for so he called it, and that he was come time enough: we
vvalkt toward the town, and as the evening went in came thither, I had an
intent to have gone to the Master of the town his house; but my Mary-bucke
told me, he had a world of strangers, and was earnest with me to go to
his mothers house; we were also to pass by the house where our black boys
father and mother dwelt: the father in regard he was blind, and kept house,
we saw not; but his mother being within, and hearing one call her sons name,
came forth and met him, and presently turning her head to the side of the
house, fell into a bitter weeping, calling only upon his name, Samgulley,
Samgulley; I would have had the boy along where I lay, but he was
Samgulley taken from us to be circumsised.
taken from us, and not suffered to go; howbeit I charged him he should not be
cut, which as they told us, was to be done in the morning; until I came to see
him, which he promised, and so we departed to our lodging: at which place
likewise was many people, and much music; but after a while that we had
been there, they all quitted the place, showing a kind of modesttie, not to
disturb us. There was no housing, nor dwellings, but was full of people; nay
likewise, under every shady and convenient tree, there was great syres, whereas
there was, their pots a seething, and their victuals adressing, and also their
mats laid, to take up their lodging, sorting themselves together in great
companies, and in most places, having music, drumming, and dancing; making
such a noise and din, as might well proceed from such kind of Actors: and
amongst them likewise they had commerce, one The great resort to this solemnity.
thing for another, so as it had a manner of resemblance to our fayres here in
England; neither was there want of any manner of provision, for as much as all
kind of people that came thither, brought some manner of sustenance with them,
and the people of the place, did provide and reserve themselves against this
time, so as I may well say it had a right resemblance to our country martes:

Amongst the rest of these dispersed companies; I took special notice of one,
who stood more remote, and was closde and severed in, under the shady trees,
which reeds, and bows set up together like a hedge, from whence proceeded, a
greater noise of voices; as also drumming, and thumping, mor clamorosly:
demanding what it meant, I was answered, in that place remained those youths
that They that were cut, kept all to gether.
were cut, and they were to continue until such time as they were recovered of
their sorenes, and that the greatness of the noise did come from those people
who kept them company, which were the younger sort of people, above their
age; who had already past, and received their circumcision: I went likewise
that night, after we had supt, to the master of the towns house; who had
sent unto me to mend my supper, a brace of Partidges, and finding there the
Ballards, or best music, and the younger sort of women gathered together
beheld their dancing, and for that they might see we had such pleasures amongst
us; I took one of them by the hand, and daunced with her, whereof th y gave
testimony The courtesy and muth that past betwixt us.
of great gladness, inuiting the rest of my company to do the like: Boo John
the master of the place, excusing himself that we lay not at his house, in
regard of much company and noise: but more especially, because one of his wives
was lately delivered of a child, unto whom he carried me within a house by
herself, where she lay after their fashion upon a mat handsomely; I gave unto
the mother for the child, a few poor beads, which were very thankfully
taken, and he said, if it had been a man child, it should have had one of our
co upanies name, with whom he had been longest acquainted; but says he, my
wife Dowry is with child, and if she bring a man child, it shall carry your
name; for so she earnestly desires: these familiarities past betwixt us, after
which we betook our selves to our several lodgings, and were nothing
frighted with the roaring cry of their devil; who at these ceremonious
meetings so soon as evening comes is conversant by his roaring voice amongst
them, and so continues all, or the most part of the night, whereof I shall
presently give you relation: But first, I must conclude of their circumcision;
for the sight whereof, as even now I told you, we did reserve our selves to
receive advertisement of our Samgulleyes cutting, which was to be done in the
morning. And accordingly, the Sun some two hours high, we had a messenger
came to entreat we would send him a white cloth, and that he would pray us
to come and see him. As soon as we came, he was brought forth into the open
field between the houses, and the place where they remained, who were cut the
day before they had taken away his clothes, they brought him ashore in; which
was shirt, breeches, and a cap of stripped stuff, after the brauest fashion of
the country, and only brought him with a white cloth close about him:
whereas we did expect some great ceremony after a religious manner to be
performed: He was first set down upon a little molehill, diverse people
coming forth to see him, amongst the which were most women, who stood
directly a little women look upon the circumcision.
distance off, looking on: the master of the town was likewise there, and
three of us; amongst which our Surgeon was one to comfort him not to fear:
he was very confident, entreating me to lay my hand upon his shoulder; from
amongst the blackes came forth an ordinary man, with a short knife in his
hand, which he whetted as he came, like one of our butchers unto a beast; and
causing the boy to stand up, he took of his cloth, giving it to a stander by
to hold, so as he was stark naked, and set his hands upon his sides, being
neither bound nor held: how beit there were some by, who offered to hold his
arms, but because he promised not to move, they let him alone, the
executioner taking hold of his members, drawing the skin over very far, as
we conceived, cut him largly, and had three several cuts before he had done,
whereat the boy Our boy circumcisised, and the manner thereof.
shrunk very little; insomuch as the master of the town who stood by told
us, he had very seldom seen any abide it with so great a courage: to our
thinking it was exceeding fearful and full of terror, insomuch as I told the
doer in a very angry manner he had utterly spoiled him; when he asked wherein, I
replied, in cutting him so deep: His answer was, it is so much the better
for him, and without any curiosity taking up his cloth showed his own
members, that it might appear he was cut as far; howbeit my distaste was
such upon him, that I could not yield to give him any thing in the way of
gratuitie to vvash his hands vvithall, and as the manner of the country is to
do by such as are friends, to the party circumcised: the thing performed, the
boys white cloth was cast over him, and by two men, who held his arms, he
was hurried apace to the same quarter, where the other that were cut
remained: We made first a request that they would let us go along to the
place with him, and were going with some of the people; but presently in

show of much We were not suffered to go amongst the new circumcised.

we should come amongst them: then we desired we might have the boy away

sooner well, then they had, showing our Surgeon unto them, who they knew
had healed No use of medicines to cure them.
vvounds and sores amongst them; but we could not prevail, by the
interposing of these ancient men some of the rest seeming to consent unto us:
so as we were there driven to leave our boy, who amongst the restof his
conforts, had without doubt no other chirur gery to cure their tender
maladies, but only to attend the expectation of time, who by the help of
their youth and nature might wear it out, which appears the rather to us, in
regard at these times, there is unto these youths allowed a certain
licentious liberty, whereby they may steal and take away peoples hens, or
powltry; nay from the Fulbies, a biefe or cattle to eat and banquet withal
amongst themselves without any offense to the laws, or government of the
country; which at other times is strict in that behalf, thereby animating,
and encouraging their spirits to more alacrity, and according to the condition
of their wanton age by these stolen delights to draw them more willingly from
the thing, and make the time of their recovery less tedious to themselves, and
discourageable to others. And if I might be worthy to deliver my opinion,
considering this their circumcision, as I have carefully observed I should
conclude, it were done of mere necessity, as a morrall law for the
preservation of their lives and healthes, and so found out by their precedent
ancestors, and by strict observations laid peremptorily upon them, wherein I
should submit my self in the account I could give to more able judgment:
only this you may please to note, it is done without any religious ceremony,
and the word in their language is expressed unto us by no other signification,
then cutting of pricks; and this is done in certain bigger towns of the
country, whether the smaller towns and habitations make their resorts,
bringing their youth to be all cut together.

And to make up the number at all these meetings, there is one sure card that

the youth in awe, and he is called by the name of Ho-re, whose strange report I
proceed unto: There is at all these meetings, some distance of from the place,
heard the noise of a roaring voice, resembling the greatest base of a man's
voice; when we demand of them what it is, they will answer, with a kind of
fear, it is Ho-re, and then describe him to be a fearful spirit, that none
may come near, without danger of being destroyde, carried away, or torn in
pieces: there is at all their meetings, upon the first notice of his voice, a
preparation for him of all manner of victuals, they have amongst them, every
one imparting somewhat, all which is carried toward the voice, and there under
He is a monstrous cater.
a tree set down, and within small time, be it of what quantity soever; it
will be found devoured, and not so much as a bone to be seen, uneaten, or
left behind, and if they be not ready forthwith to carry him such provisions,
as shall content him, some of their uncircumcised sons are instantly taken
away; females he meddles not with, and said to remain in Ho-reyes belly, some
of them nine or ten days, from whence Sumetimes 8 or 9 atonec, are carried
away, and said to be in his belly.
they must be redeemed with some belly provision: and it is strange to hear,
how confidently they will report unto you, that they have been carried away,
and been abiding there: wherein this is observed, that look how many days he
has been kept away, or remaining, as they say in Ho-reyes belly, so many
days after they return, it must be, before they will, or dare open their
mouths, to speak a word. For confirmation of which, this I have seen: as I
walked one day into the country from our dwelling to Ferambras house, distant
some four mile, in the way we were to pass through a town of the Fulbies,
among the people that looked upon us, I was shevved a youth of some eighteen
years of age, who they said, came but the night before out of Ho-reyes belly:
I went toward him, and urged him to speak Coming forth they speak not for
certain days.
unto me, but still he went back from me, and kept his finger before his
mouth, and notwithstanding I made what means I could, by pulling and pinching
of him, and more to terrify him, making proffers with a false fire to shute
at him, being naturally exceeding fearful of our gunnes, I could not
prevail, neither make him open his mouth: notwithstanding afterward, the same
fellow did often come, and have commerce amongst us: nay our people, who were
lying, and dwelling in the country, had been at several times frighted with
the voice of this Ho-rey, for having staide in their fowling, or being abroad,
until night has overtaken them, in their coming home, as they have said,
they have heard the voice of Ho-re, as they might conceive, some mile from
them, and before they could pass ten steps, he has seemed to be in their
very backs, with fright whereof, maintained by their imagination, of their
report went of him, they have not, without a ghastly dread, recovered home: unto
which place of dwelling, he never was so bold to make any attempt: and verily
my opinion is, that it is only some illusion, either by the Marybuckes, or
among the elder sort, to form and keep in obedience those younger sort: for
better approbation of what I suppose, I will crave the patience, to set down
what I observed at the circumcision of our black boy: The nights were Our
opinion concerning Ho-re.
very light, the Moon being then about the full toward midnight, coming
from Bo John's house to the place at Faye, Ho-reyes voice was wondrous busy,
as it seemed to me, not far of. I spoke unto my consorts, we would secretly
take our arms, and steal down, to see what it was, one of our three was
backevvard and unwilling, whereby it came to pass, our Marybucke understood
what we intended, who came earnestly unto me, entreating, I would give over
that dangerous attempt, saying, I could not find him, for one cry would be
hard by me, and another instantly beyond the river, which was a mile of, and
there was great danger, he would carry me into the River with him: when he
perceived, he could not alter my resolution, he held me by the arm, and
pointing to a black, not far from me, held down his head. I went to that
man, being a very lusty fellovv, to speak unto him, whose voice was grown
so horse, by crying like Ho-re, he had no utterance, vvhereupon I returned to
my Marybucke, How he was partly discovered.
and said, there is one of your Devils; who with a smile went his way from
me.

But that the devil has great recourse amongst them, is without qvestion,
especially, as I noted before, with the Rimers or Iuddyes; I will specify one
intelligence we had, and so leave him there amongst them: When we came first
up the River, we were uncertain of our own times, much less then any
other, could six hours of going, staying, or coming to a place: howbeit we
were to come to a town called Pompetane, at which place An example of the
devils converse with the Fiddlers.
dwelt a Portingall, called Jasper Consaluos, who had a young kinsman with him,
called Marko, but no women but blacks; this dwelling of his was the highest by
many leagues of any Portugal in the River; and uery fair quart er, ever past
betwixt us, we came to this place, the 14. of December, between eight and nine
in the morning, and notwithstanding, the dwelling houses were somewhat remote
from the river, we found standing upon the bank at the landing place this
Consaluos, who in friendly sort saluted us, and carried us up to his housing,
where presently we found ready a very good breakefast of hens, and other good
refreshing, which he said, was provided for us: we seemed to marvel he should
know of our coming thither, but aster he told us, that the evening before, he
was at another town within the land, and had no meaning to come home, when as
there came unto him a Iuddy ot Fiddler, which dwelt in the town with him, and
did likewise show us the man, who told him that Ho-re had acquainted him, that
the next morning, and at such an hour, there would be so many white men at
Pompetane, naming the number that were in our boats, and that there they would
land: but to what purpose, either to do good or hurt, the Devil was ignorant;
and upon The Devil could not tell the Portingall where we were friends or foes.
this intelligence, I retired my self, and came away hither to meet you,
whereat we seemed much to wonder, being altogether our selves uncertain of
any hour, in regard, we diverse times went a shore, and shooting at foul and
such like occasions diverse times lighted upon us; notwithstanding the devils
intelligence, we were no ways discomforted; for he did confess, he was
altogether ignorant of our intended actions, and the conclusion was, how by his
intelligence, the worst hurt we had, was a better, and more readier breakefast.

It follows, concerning what trades, or occupations is in use amongst them,
whereof we note only three: the first and chiefest is the Ferraro or Smith,
who holds a good repute: notwithstanding, they have no Iron of their own
making, but what is The trades or occupations they have in use, their painful
season of thunder and lightning, also what fruits and plants the Country
yeeldes, and are growing there amongst them.
brought unto them, whereof they have most needesull use, and neither may, or
can live without it: for first of the Iron we bring unto them, they do fashion
and make all those short swords they were, next the heads of their Assigies, or
Iauelings, as also the heads of their throwing darts, and the barbed heads of
their shooting arrows, which are covered over with their deadly poison: in
many of these the Smith does show a pretty kind of art and making: but the most
needful use amongst them, is the tool or instrument, wherewith they till
their ground: without use of which, they could hardly have their The Smith.
being, and therefore Iron, a principal commodity, that they do call upon; at
the lower part of the River, where the Portingall frequents, they have more for
exchange then above, whereas we are upon a certain trade: for we cut our Iron
of twelve inches, and that is the proportion looked after, and so high as it
flows, the Kings and Governors will call for that length: but passing above
eight yuches will go as friendly; which in either of them, is gain enough,
the return even in the worst, yielding ten for one, carrying our iron in
bars, we are enforced to make use of their Smiths, to cut it to the
proportion, we must use, and therefore sending sor him, he comes to the water
side, bringing his shop with him, that is his bellows, and a small Anuill,
which he strikes into the ground under a shady tree, and only of one kind An
excellent charcole to work their Iron,
of red wood, amongst them, they can make artificial Charcoale, which will
give our Iron his true heat, as any seacoale, his boy blowing the bellows,
that lie on the ground, the nose of them, through a hard earth, made of purpose
with a hole in it, and in this manner with a hammer and a tool, they cut it
for us, receiving satisfaction, to us easy enough, but what it is consists of
Iron; and chary we must be to look to our measuring, or he will use his best
understanding to purloyne; and this for the Smith and his esteem amongst them:
The next is he whom we call a Sepatero; one that does make all their Gregory's,
wherein The Sepatero they of this trade are most ingenious.
truly is a great deal of art shown, they being made and fashioned of
leather into all shapes, both round and square, and triangle, after that neat
manner as might be allowed for workmanship, even amongst our curious
handicrafts: these men are likewise they that make their saddles and bridles;
of which bridles I have seen so neately made up, as with leather, even here in
our own country, could hardly be mended: whereby appears, they have
knowledge to dress their leather. Howbeit I conceive, only their goats and
dear skins, which they can color and dye: but to greater beasts hides,
their apprehension cannot attain, and some of these are held for curious
persons, and deep capacities: for they will be feeling of some stuff
garments we wear, and do think, and will boldly say, that we do make them
of the hides, we buy from them, and will not do it in their sight, because
they shall not learn; and for our paper, we bring, they absolutely conclude,
it is made of the hyde, and likewise many other things they see us use, they
will say, comes and is framed of those Elephants teeth we carry from them,
allowing much of a more deeper knowledge in us, then themselves in many things
applying it amiss, and to impossibilities.

Another profession we find, and those are they who temper the earth, and
makes the walls of their houses, and likewise earthen pots they set to the
fire, to boil and dress their food in for all other occasions, they use no
other mettle, but serve themselves with the gourd, which performs it very
neatly; The Potter and tobacco pipemaker.
only one principal thing, they canoot miss, and that is their Tobacco
pipes, whereof there is few or none of them, be they men or women does walk or
go without, they do make only the bowl of earth, with a neck of the same
about two inches long, very nea^ly and a^^ificially coloring or glasing the
e^^^h very hansomly, all the bowls being very great, and for the most part
will hold half an ounce of Tobacco; they put into the neck a long kane, many
times a yard of length, and in that manner draw their smoke, whereof they are
great takers, and cannot of all other things live without it. These are the 3
professed trads, other things they They have in the highest of the River,

need, and that are in use amongst them, are common to every man, to do or
make, as his occasion requires, whereof the most especial in use is matts,
such as they eat their meat upon, sit upon, and also make their beds,
having no other thing indeed to lie upon, and therefore, as we rightly term
it, is the Staple commodity, they have amongst them: while we were in the
River, at a place called Mangegar, against which we had occasion to ride with
our ship, both up and down, in the open fields, about a mile distance from any
housing, is every monday a market kept; which is in the middle of the week,
unto which would come great resort of people, from round about, as here in our
country, A market kept every monday.

shady trees, and take up a good space of ground, and any thing what the
Country did yield, was there brought in, and bought and sold amongst them. Now
through the whole Country there is no use of any coin, or money, neither have
they any, but every man to No money or coin amongst them.
choppe and barter one thing for another, and the only nominated thing is
matts, as in asking the price of this, or that I desire, the word is, how many
matts shall I give you? so as they are still in use; and these are the several
Trades, and manner of course the common people follow, or have among them.

And so I pass to their laborious travel, and general trade amongst them,
from which none are exempted, but the Kings and principal persons themselves,
or such as by age are past their labor, otherwise all, the Mary-bucke, both
Priest, and people, and of all sizes, as they are able, put to their hands to
till the earth, and sow their corn. And for that the goodness of God unto us
may the more appear, and the Reader stirred up the rather, to All labor to
till the earth and sow their grain.
acknowledge his mercies, let us call to mind, the words which God said unto
Adam, after his fall in Paradise; In the sweat of thy brows shall thou eat
thy bread: and with care and sorrow shall thou eat it, and acknowledge these
people, to abide the curse indeed; and our selves mittigated, through his
merciful favor: For the earth likewise receiving s^^^^se, does naturally
bring forth unprofitable things, whereby man is forced for his necessary
sustenance, to till and plant the same: now God has lent and given unto us,
the beasts of the field, (which likewise they enjoy) but he has endued us with
an understanding and knowledge, to make the beasts, and cattle, to serve and
obey our wills in plowing and opening the earth, thereby easing, and as it were
taking away the sweat of our brows, They understand not to make their cattle
work.
which knowledge he has denied unto them, and not withstanding they have so
many herds of fitting cattle, they understand not to make use of them, but
even with their own hands, in the true sweat of their brows, do they follow
their painful labor, as I here relate it: They reserve great fields to sow
their corn in, which they raise up in furrows, as decently as we do here,
but all their labor, is with their hands, having therein a short stick, of
some yard in length, upon the end whereof is put a broad Iron, like unto our
paddle staves, which Iron set into the ground, one leading the way, carries up
the earth before him, so many others following after him, with their several
Irons, doing as he leads, as will raise up a sufficient furrow, which
followed to the end of the ground, they The manner of their painful labors.
begin again in this painful and laborious manner, fitting the earth for
the grain, wherein our old proverb is to be allowed of, Many hands make light
work; otherwise it would appear a most tedious kind of labor. They have
six several sorts of grain, they do feed upon, amongst which none is
known to us by name (I mean here in Their co^, or grain.
England) but only Rice; the other may rather be called a kind of seed then
corn, being of as small a grain as mustard seed, neither do they make any
bread, but boiling their grain, roll it up in balls (as I have said before)
and so eat it warm: in like sort they boil their Rice, and eat it warm;
and even to us it is a very good and able sustenance: all other grains being
sowed, the ground is with their Irons spadled over, and so left to his growth:
but in Rice they do set it first in small patches of low The manner of their

marish grounds, and after it does come up, disperse the plants, and set them
in more spacious places, which they prepare for it, and it does yield a great
increase; they do likewise observe their seasons, to set other plants, as
Tobacco, which is ever growing about their houses; and likewise, with great
carfulness, they prepare the ground, to set the The planting of cotton
seeds of the Cotton wool, whereof they plant whole fields, and coming up,
as Roses grow, it bears coddes, and as they ripen, the codde breaks, and
the wool appears, which shows the time of gathering.

And before I pass to speak of other natural plants, that proceed and come
forth without labor, I must not omit to relate here, the farther misery of
this laboring people, that thereby we may discern, the greater mercy we do
enjoy, for whereas it bath pleased God, to afford unto us seasonable times, to
plant and sow, and again to reap, and enjoy our labor, sending likewise The
misery of the people.
gentle showers and raines, whereby we receive them in a due season; he has not
dealt so with all Nations, whereof these are witnesses; for although their
seasons are certain, yet they are violent and fearful: For from September,
unto the latter end of May following, almost nine months, they never taste
any showers of rain, so as their ground is so hard, through the extreme heat
of the Sun, that they can make no use thereof, but are compelled to stay
until rain does fall, to moysten the earth, that their instruments may enter,
to prepare the same: which raines, at the first come gently, now and then a
shower, but not without thunder, and lightning; Toward the end of June, it
then grows more forcible, pouring it self violently forth with such
horrible storms, and gusts of wind, and with such fearful flashes of
lightning, and claps of thunder, as if (according to our phrase) heaven and
earth would meet together: in all which notwithstanding, The times of their
raines and the fearefulnes thereof.
the miserable people are driven to work and labor, in the open field, for
Ioosing the season of the grounds softness; and as it does begin, after a
more gentle manner, in the same nature and distance of time it passes away,
the most extreme force being from the middle of July, until the middle of
August, and the abundance of rain that then does fall, may be supposed, in
that it does raise the River from his usual height, directly upright thirty
foot, and where it has not bank to defend it ouer-flowes the shoares, and
therefore they prepare their habitations, in their own discretions,
accordingly, and in some years not without danger: Now in regard many people
of our Country, have been lost, and that our Seamen directly charge the
vnholsomnesse of the air, to be the sole cause, I would presume a little to
argue it, delivering my opinion, hoping it may inuit some abler understanding,
to search into it, and produce some better assistance, to avoid the
inconvenience, then I am able to deliver. A fair entreaty to men of judgment.


It is certain, in regard of the grounds hardness in those nine months when
the raines are past, that the superficies, or upper part of the earth, does
receive all that venom, or poisonous humors which distill either from trees
or plants, whereof there is store, as we see by the abundance they use in
poisoning their Arrows, and some of their Lances; and likewise, what does
issue from their venomous Serpents, and Snakes, of which kinds there are very
many, both great, and exceeding long; also Toades and Scorpions: the poison
does remain and continue in the The great abundance of poison.
dryness of the ground, and rakte up in the dust and sand, which upon the
first raines, being moystned, and the earth wet, by the exhalation of the hot
Sun is drawn up, and in short time in the next showers falls down again; in
my poor judgment, some reason appears that those first times must be very
pestilent, and full of danger; which in some sort testifi is it self, in
regard those first raines, lighting upon the naked body, do make blaines and
spots, which remain aster them, much more then after the raines have
continued, and more perfectly washed, and cleard the supersicies; and not only
upon the bodies, but in the garments, The nature of the first raines.
or clothes worn; who being laid by, after they are wet with the first
raines, do sooner, and in greater number breed and bring forth untoward
worms; whereas other ways, after the raines are more common, it does not
produce any such effect, or if it do, very little. To this I say, that it is a
thing to be especially observed, as much as men may, to avoid the being in
those first raines, and more especially to be provided of water, either to
drink, or dress meat withal, before these seasons fall; except it be An
observation to be kept.
those who dwell and abide upon the land, and may have means to cover and
keep close their springs; but for men to water, in those pestilent times, and
in the open Rivers, as the Saint John's men in their first voyage did, I say it
was a desperate attempt, and might have been the confusion of them all, as
indeed there were but few of them escaped; and that the country is not so
contagious, as they would have their reports to make it, those people of ours
may be witness, who being willing to stay behind, and remaining there almost
three years, there was not one of them dyed, but returned all into their own
country, being eight of them in number, except only A note of experience.
Captain Tompson, who as I repeat before, was slain by unhappy accident.

I would willingly also venture here, and speak my opinion, what naturally may
be said, concerning these contagious times; but with this prouiso, it is done
to animate others, who if they knew the certain course and season, with the
true manner of each particular circumstance, would be able to demonstrate
better, and so rectify me in that where I shall do amiss. These seasons I
say, begin gently in the end of May, when the Sun draws to the end of his
Northern progress, in the Tropicke of Cancer, whose power, as it may appear,
draws up after him those An observation of the tempestuous times.
great and clowdy vapors, which directly, come perpetually out of the
Southeast, and from no other place or point, which following after the force of
the Sun, as they rise higher, and nearer the heat, begin to dissolve; but as
the Sun turns back again, and comes in his reuerse to meet with these
massy vapors, sending in his forceable raynes amongst those clowdy
substances, compels them to give way, and break in sunder, the violence
whereof produces that terrible thunder, and fearful lightning which
follows, and great abundance of rain which falls: which as it does
appear, is most terrible, when the Sun, and those vapors are as it were
incorporate; for from the middle of July, until the middle of August, the
extremity is, and by that time in September, the Sun is again in his
equinoctial the air does clear, and all the storms do end; and so it
appears, that as the Sun, after his coming from the Equinoctial, in his
whole Northern progress is raising, and drawing these vapors after, so in his
reuerse again from the Tropicke, until he comes to the Equinoctial he is
dissoluing, and clearing the same again, all which observing as a natural
man, I commend to the ingenious practitioner, either to amend, or make use of;

almighty power to thesevnbeleeuing people, that in regard, they will not accept
of that pleasing, and peaceful intelligence of our loving and meek Savior
his blessed Son; they shall feel and fear his omnipotent power, in
trembling under those incomprehensible terrors, which as he says in Job, are
prepared for his enemies: Again, if it has pleased him to appoint certain
places upon the earth, where more especially those great and fearful works
of his shall appear, thereby to daunt and keep down the hawty aspirings of

us and our habitions under those contagious clymates, and how much more is his
great power manifested, that has appointed bounds, and lymits, as he says
himself of the swelling Seas, so likewise of these fearful seasons;
hethereto shall you come, and shall exceed no further.

And now to add comfort unto us that are, or shall be called to travel these
parts: first, the times and seasons are certain, that men may either avoid
them by leaving the country, when they are to come, or by preparing themselves
with things necessary, be the better able to endure them, when they are come;
of which now we have had such experience, as we can expound things outwardly,
by Gods permission requisite and auailcable, and inwardly frame our bodies and
dispositions to the country and seasons agreeable: and this is encouraged with
a comfortable resolution, that the continuance is not long, and that we know
the ends, and termination of the season, which before experience, A comfort to

was a fearful discourager: So I return back, to speak of the natural
plants, which following the laborious courses, I was driven to omit.

They have naturally growing, which is but only near the mouth of the river,

we have seen, and had brought unto us, far up in the river, at some times
good store, that shows Orenges.
there are trees in the country, and that they might be stored, if the people
were ingenious, and either would or could know how to plant them: but to
speak of things that the whole country yields plentifully, and what is
esteemed and set by amongst them, whereof especially, we note Palmeta trees,
and in some places there are whole grounds or groves of them, the use whereof
is to draw from them a most sweet and pleasant drink, which we call Palmeta
Wine, and as we approve and like of it to be toothsome, so likewise in Good
wine sorth of a tree.
operation, we find it wholesome; the manner whereof is this, they do cut into
the body of the tree holes, in some more, in some less, as the tree is in
substance, to whichholes, they place a hollow cane cut sloping to go the
neatlier in, into which the juice of the tree distilleth, and is conueid, as in
pipes, unto gourdes set handsomely into the ground reddy to receive it, which
is in less then twenty four hours taken away, and as they please disposed
of: now this is of that esteem, that the vulgar sort may not meddle with, but
the principal persons, and therefore they will send of this unto us, four or
five miles distance, as a courteous present; the taste whereof, does truly
resemble white Wine when it comes first over into England, having the same
sweetness of taste, and in color, if they were together, not to be
distinguished; only this is the misery, it will not keep above one day, for
if you reserve of it until the morning it will grow sour, notwithstanding any
diligence that can be used; and of this kind there are several sorts and
tastes, as there are in white Wines, which the people themselves distinguish by
several names; calling some Sabbagee, Bangee, Tangee, Several sorts thereof.
Palmeta apples
and other names, as the trees are from whence it comes. Some Palmeta trees,
do likewise carry great store of Apples, which the country people will feed
upon, especially the younger sort.

And being entered into their good liquour, I must not forget, to speak of the
knowledge they have in making a compounded drink, which we can afford to
taste, and accept of; and it is made of some corn, Amade drink, called Dullo.
boild and ordered as we do our Ale; they call it Dullo, it is not common
amongst them, but when the King or principal person will make a feast, he
calls all the inhabitants about him, and having a great gourd or two,
sometimes three, of this liquour in his presence they drink round, and it is
divided amongst them, making an end of all before they part, and it is of that
operation, it will warm their brains, and set their tongues a working: the
poor Fulbye finding that we affect it, will many times watch for a private
conueyance, but if the Blackes meet with him, they will surely drink it, and
send him home again, having lost his market; Now because I speak of gourdes,
which are growing things, it is fit I tell you, they do grow, and resemble
just that we call our Pumpion, and in that manner are placed, and carried upon
their walls and houses, being of all manner of different sorts; from Gowrdes.
no bigger then an egg, to those that will hold a bushel, and the necessary
use they have of them, to eat, and drink, and wash their clothes in, with
diverse other very fit occasions, gives the^ just cause to preserve them

away, in regard of the extreme bitterness, whereof the shell it self so
savors, as no use can be made, until it be perfectly seasoned; and they have
likewise growing Pumpions in the self same manner we have, and in like case
they do convert to sustenance: But to rise higher from Locuste.
the ground; they have likewise great store of Locust trees, which growing in
clusters of long cods together in the beginning of May, grows to his ripenes,
which the people will seed upon, especially the younger sort, if they can make
shift to get them down, the trees being big, and of a good height, with
this I must join honey, which does appear likewise to grow; and the country
is very full, wherein the people use one of the ingenious parts I see amongst
them, for upon those great trees, which are growing about their houses, in many
places you shall have them make baskets of reeds and sedge, which they will
make fast, on the out bows of the tree, and in those the Bees Wild honey.

baskets on some convenient trees, that in our ignorance, before we knew it,
being distant of, we might conceit it was some fruit the tree had yielded; also
in holes of hollow trees, amongst the woods still bees are plenty, so that
another John Baptist, if any were, might in this place and that with plenty,
receive his full of Locust and wild honey.

And for trees of great and large bodies, they be here, especially one sort,
which does carry upon a long stalk, a great and round fruit, yielding a kind
of pleasing pith within: Whereupon the Baboones Munkies meat.

number, as I shall declare hereafter: and some of these trees retain that

is tolerable, and serves if he fall to feed the wild A stony apple.

conclude their fruits, with that which is in most esteem amongst them; which
is a fruit in proportion, much like our bigger sort of chestnuts, flat on both
sides, but has no hard shell on the outside, they call them Gola, and we Nuts:

operation of him, is with them so set by, that ten is a present for a King:
this operation we find, that after we have eaten of him down, notwithstanding
his bitter taste, the water we drink presently after, although it he out of
the River, shall have a relish like white wine, carrying that sweetness, as if
it were mixed with sugar; and likewise the Tobacco we take presently after,
shall have that sweetness one would much admire: other operation we find
none, yet so do they esteem them that the ancient persons having lost their

were at the highest part of the river, the people brought them abundantly unto
us, and did wonder much, we made no more esteem or care to buy them: but where
they grow, or whence they had them, we are yet ignorant, although the
Portingall affirms, they come from the golden country, neither will they
last, or continue by any knowledge we have to keep them, being subject to
wither, or be eat with worms, as by trial I proved, keeping of them, to
have showed in England, as I much desired. They have neither Onyons, nor
Garlike: howbeit, Garlike is a thing they much desire, wherewith we see them
rather rub their heads and bodies, then affect to feed on: neither have they
any herbs, or flowers, which either for taste or smell they esteem, but only
one called Binning, which carrying a sharp, or sour taste like Samphire, we
used for This is like our water Lilly.
sauce, and that they seeing, would ordinarily bring unto us: howbeit when we
came upon diverse mountains, and sundry woods, we should retain such sweet
sinells, as would be very pleasing; from whence we concluded the Bees did
gather, and make up theit honey. And I will make my conclusion of the Plants
amongst them, with that which unto me brought admiration; which was a tree, or
bush, commonly growing upon the top of the River bank, resembling much our
great Barbery bushes, only having a little ragged leaf, whereunto coming,
with all the diligence might be devised, not to touch or move it, but only
with all gentleness, between your fingers and thumb, touching a leaf, the
whole bow should presently close up every lease together, as if they feared
and found themselves offended: but if you touched or stird a little sprigge, the
whole tree should close his leaves after a most sensible manner. The sensible
tree.
Whereof taking especial notice, we did allow it to be the sensible tree, of
which ancient authors have written; which we did observe to carry a kind of
yellow flowers like our hedge roses: with the strangeness whereof concerning
plants, I here conclude my story.

The discourse of the wild beasts.
AND now I am to speak of the vvild beasts the country is stored withal,
whereof I am to begin with those that are ravenous and offensive, keeping the
people in dread, and as his pleasure requires the Lion is first, whereof there
are very many, which we can speak by perfect knowledge; although we cannot
say, eye-vvitnesses, for our gracious God has so ordained, that those beasts
which are most tyrannous All reuenous beasts in the day time keep their
dens.
to others, and boldest against man, as ashamed of their bloody actions,
notvvithstanding their ablenes and strength, do shut themselves up in the
bowels of the earth all the day time, as it were confinde from the glorious
light of the Sun, being one of Gods comfortablest creatures; So that in the
night, is their times of walking, and our knowledge of them, is by their
roarings and noise they make, whereby one beast is distinguished from an other,
but the Lion is more especially to be taken The Lion.

of a small spaniell, which so soon as the Evening comes, hunts and busles
about for the preye, and coming on the foot, follows the sent with open cry,
to which the Lion being master huntsman gives diligent ear, and applies
himself to follow, for his own ease and advantage; if it so happen the Jack

of his prey at three iumps, he scorns to pursue, or toil himself after it:
and being ceazd, he remains feeding, making a kind of grumbling noise: whilst
his small servant stands barking, and yalping by, attending until his Master
has feasted, and then he falls upon the remainder. And this, as we hear, and
receive from the country people; so likewise it is affirmed unto us by our
own ttauailes: for as we had occasion when the tides fell out to travail up
the River in the night; and likewise many times to The causes of our knowledge.
ride all night at an Anchor in the River against desert places, we did observe
the noise, and hunting of this Jack All, and likewise note the reply, and
answer of the Lion, insomuch, as it was a commonn word amongst us, who will go
on shore, and accompany the Master huntsman.

There are Ounces and Leopards great store, whereof by reason of the many
dens we see upon the land, we may discern the print of the foot, remaining
upon the holes mouth, being able to assure us what is within, as also the
country people do bring many of their skins unto us to sell, how ever
Ounces, and Leopards.
they light upon them; for by their own valor, sure they dare not, and by
their ingenious capacities, I believe they cannot devise any course to lessen
their company. The Ounce does seem to be more ravenous, or dangerous unto
them, then either Lion The Ounce dangerous.
or any others, and makes more spoil upon them, as they do complain, I was
showed a child there, which the mother gave suck unto, who early in a morning
going near to her house to a spring to fetch water, had laid her child wrapped
in a Cloth without her door upon a matte, as they use to do, and there came a
hungry Ounce, who it seemed had mist his nights prey, and took up the cloth
and child, and run his ways, the mother met him, and with woeful outcry
pursued him, and as it chanced A true tale of a Child.
he took the way to come right upon the place, where the Father of the child
with other people were laboring in the field, who with roaring voices run
after him, the Ounce still ran away, keeping his hold, but as it chanced, the
child dropped forth of the cloth, and the father running after, recovered it,
and took it up, the Ounce carried clean away the cloth, and the man brought
back the child to the mother; the which we our selves have both seen and
handled: and so bold and fierce is the Ounce, that many times in the night, he
has driven a small dog we had, where we dwelt on shore to our bedsides by a
hole he had through our straw wales, barking and running under our beds, not
daring to look out, howsoever we encouraged him, until we were feign with
firebrands in our hands to go abroad, and so fear him away: and many more
are there of night enemies, which vvatch and look after their careful
husvvisery, amongst which especially is the great Ciuit Cat, Ciuit Cat.
Porcupine.
and the Porcupin, who are careful purueighers for any outlying poultrey,
whose view early in the morning is their discovery, the Cattes by the print
of their feet left in the sand, and the Porcupine by his quills, which are
shed, and many times taken up in plenty; and so I end with their night enemies,
and as I stand conceited, cruel acquaintance, because what after I deliver, is
upon such beasts, as walk, and show themselves by day: and howsoever, they
stand in fear of them, it is rather out of a timorousness, in the people,
then any willingness in the beast.

The first where of is the Elephant, whose presence indeed, as he is a wild
beast, may even to a strong person give a just amazement; and such is the
fear, the country people in general, have of them, that by all possible
means, they seek to shun and fly from them, yet such is the great
abundance the The Elephant.
Country does yield of them, that they are over all places, and wheresoever
you come, you shall find the footing and apparent show they have been there,
though not presently to be seen: and notwithstanding those great abundance of
wild ones, they have not any of them tame, or under command. as in other
places of the world they have, which certainly proceeds from the fear they
conceive of them: much, and great is the spoils they do them, both among
their corn, and especially in their Cotton grounds, going in small companies
together, whereof I have seen sixteen very great ones, besides young ones
that sucked, and others that were of middle statures; the proportion The stature
of the great ones.
of the greatest I leave you thus to conjecture of: the reeds or sedge, that
grows naturally in every place, is higher above our heads, then the arm of a
tall man can well reach; and half the body of those Elephants, is above the
reeds, their natural feeding is amongst this sedge, but more especially,
they do browse upon trees whereof in the woods, you shall find store by them
pulld down, and that of big bodies, and round substance; the manner He
browses like a dear.
whereof I must relate, to correct the mistaking, which is most common in
picturing the Elephant, whose two great teeth are commonly set in his lower
law, carrying them upward, as a Bore does his tusks which is contrary, for he
carries them downward, and with them breaks down the trees, for after with
his truncke he has bended the top, he haspes over his two teeth, so as one
or other must needs give way, and that is the reason, that among those
multitude of teeth, that are brought over, so many broken teeth, and cracked and
shaken are amongst them, for it the tree be too strong, the tooth gives way,
and so the people find many iunkes and pieces, which they sell unto us, and the
abundance of those teeth, that are yearly brought from thence, may satisfy
what store of these beasts are in the country; for as I have spoken with many,
who considering the great store are brought away, have A false opinion
conceived, they had shed their teeth, as Stagges do mew their horns, which
directly is nothing so, but by the death of the beast, the teeth are gotten;
what casual deaths they are subject unto we are ignorant: and for any
practice of the peoples, too much fear possesses them, so far as we have
seen, one place alone excepted, which I will manifest unto you: within four
miles where our habitation was, there stood a good spacious plantation, the
Commander whereof we called Ferambra, who was always a friend of ours; as we
were in our dwelling, upon our Christmasse day, at dinner; This was that
Ferambra I noted before.
where (God be praised) we had varieties of meat: to mend our fare, just in
the dinner time, there came four black people unto us, whereof two were
laden, and had great gourds upon their heads, as much as they could stand
under, the one full of Palmeta wine, the other of raw flesh, which were
Presents sent me from this Ferambra, who sent Elephants flesh good to feed
upon.
me word, he had killed an Elephant, and had sent me some part thereof; our
dainty stomachs looked asquash at such gross flesh, yet I received it kindly,
and gave it away to our black neighbors, who eat it very merrily. The next
day I went to Ferambras house, and the fashion of the Country is to entertain
us, with their best provision of diet, amongst which we had Elephants flesh,
whereupon both my self, and consorts that were with me, fed very heartily, and
found it good and sauoury meat: I desired to know how he killed them; And he
showed me one of his black people, and said, There was none but he alone
durst do it; and taking down a lauclin, The manner how he killed them.
which hung in the house, the staff some ten foot long; the Iron or head
whereof was bound up in a cloth, which he opened and showed me, and it was laid
with poison all over; he said, his manner was, when he saw the Elephants
feeding in the high sedge, he would steal in amongst them, and by creeping,
still keeping himself behind them, he would recover so near, as to strike
his Iauelin into the body of the beast, and leaving it there, take to his
heels, and through the long reeds escape away: and the warm blood dissoluing
the poison upon the Iauelin, it presently spreads it self, to the cruel
torture of the beast, the extremity whereof killes him; the people in the
mean time, upon trees, and places of advantage, being set round about to watch
him, and so soon as he is down, come to him, presently cutting away so much
of the flesh as is inflamed with the poison, which they throw away, reserving
the rest for their own sustenance: and in this manner he has killed me so
many, as you see I have tails here hanging up; And except I brought two of
these tails away with me.
in this place, I never heard but the people were wondrous fearful of them:
the experience whereof, was in those black people, I had in my boat when I
went up the River: It was my manner, as I could with conueniencie, to adventure
and set upon such as we met withal, but my Blacks would always tremble, and
run away; and many several attempts I had upon them, wherein I must say, as
I found, that they were as fearful as a forest Stagge, and according to
their greatness, went as The Elephant a fearful beast.
swift from us as they could, which pace was faster, then a good able man could
run, whereof I had trial in one great beast, who notwithstanding we had
shot three times, the blood running down his sides, escapt away from us, that
we lost him, whom afterward the people found dead, and brought his teeth to
sell unto us; and had we been provided accordingly, we might have made diverse
preys upon The peoples admiration, we durst set upon them.

would come down on purpose to look upon us, and dernaund of our Blackes,
which was he that durst set upon an Elephant.

and large tusks, and carrying up his tufted tail, of a great length, boult

There are likewise large Antelops, and Dear of Antelops. Dear of all sorts.
all manner of sorts spread over the whole country, with beasts of that kind,
whose names we are ignorant of; and many strange hydes they do bring unto us,
amongst which there is one beast, whose hide is fourteen foot of length, of a
dunne color, and strokt with white. Another sort I must needs remember, whose
great abundance may well put me in mind, besides their society and
neighborhood, which in our travel up the River we were often acquainted
withal, which are, the Babownes and Munkeys, whereof the country has
innumerable Munkies.
store, and where they are, they do go in herds, and companies, but are of
two societies: the Munkeys always keep by themselves, and great and little as
they are; only of that kind consort together, and even in Islands that lie
within the River, they are as frequent as on the main, which condemns the
report is of them, that they cannot swim, but being in the water will drown
presently, and in my own knowledge I can affirm, that having bought a Monkey
from the country people, who use to bring them unto us, and sell them for poor
things; being got loose in my boat that rid in the middle of the River, he
leapt into the water to swim on shore, and being pursued by one of our men,
who swamme after him, he did diue under water, diverse and sundry times, before
he could recover him. Babownes a strange story.


But to speak of the Babowne, I must say, it is a wonderful thing, to observe
a kind of commonwealth that is amongst them; they have none but their own
kind together, and are in heardes, of three or four thousand in a company; as
they travel, they go in rank, whereof the leaders are certain of the
greater sort, and there is as great, and large of them, as a Lion, the smaller
following, and ever now and then as a Commander a great one walks; the
females carry their young under their bellies, except she have two, and then
one under, the other above. In the rear comes up a great company of the biggest
sort, as a guard, against any persuing enemy, and in this manner do they march
along: they are very bold, and as we pass in the river, when we come near
their troops, they will get up into the trees, and stand in gaze upon us, and
in a kind of collericke humor the great ones will shake the trees, and with
his hands clatter the boughs in that fashion, as it does exceed the strength
of a man, to do the like, barking, and making a noise at us, as if they were
much offended, and in this manner, many times they will follow us along, and in
the night time, where we ride at an ancker take up their stands, or lodgings
on the mountain tops, or on the trees that are above us, whereas we hear
their government: A government amongsts them
for many times in the night you shall hear such a noise of many of their
voices together, when instantly one great voice exalts it self, and presently
all are hush, and the noise is dashed, so as we were wont to say, Master
Constable speaks; likewise when we are a shore and meet with these troops,
on a sudden the great ones will come forward, and seem to grin in our faces;
but offer up a gunne, and away they pack. One of our people one day as we came
near the shore in our boat, and a troop of these shauers, being gazing on
us, made a shot and killed one of them, which before the boat could get on shore,
the others had taken up betwixt them and carried quite away, but we have killed
of them, which the country people do much desire, and will eat very
heartely; wherein I hope never to take their part: And lastly let me tell The
people of the Country eat them.

holds of them, and does not stick to write it, that they are absolutely a
race and kind of people, who in regard they will not be brought to work, and
live under subjection, refuse to speak, and so he reports of them.

And to conclude, amongst their multitude of wild beasts, we have enquired
amongst them: especially, when I was at the highest in the country, whether
they could tell or report of a Unicorn, setting forth unto them a beast, with
one only horn in his forehead, and certainly they have told me, that higher
within the land there is a beast, which has one only horn in the same
manner, but describe the beast, to be both about the color and bigness of a
vallow Dear, and the horn to The pleoples report of a Unicorn.
be about the length of their arm, and no otherwise, which is nothing like to
the description of a Unicorn, as he is with us set out, if there be any such
beast; whereof indeed I am very doubtful, and so I am come to the last, which
is to deliver, what land foul, and of that nature, there do remain wild as
we have seen amongst them.

The discourse of land foul.
AMongst such foul and birds that remain and live upon the land, in our
travels up the River, and our daily walks and travels upon the shore; our
indraught being so many hundred miles, we never saw any Estriches, neither did
any of the country people, ever bring any of their feathers to barter, or sell
unto us, so as it appears plainly there is none of them in these parts;
notwithstanding in the River of Senega, which is to the Northward, and likewise
again more Southerly, upon the Sea coast of Africa great store: Therefore the
greatest bird or foul we see, is called a Stalker; who by reason of his long
legs and neck, when he stands upright, The Stalker.
is in height taller then a man, his body in substance is more then an
indifferent lamb which we do feed upon, and find it somewhat a dry meat,
but well allowed for nourishment, and by the country people much esteemed of:
The especial desire we have to kill them, is in regard of some feathers he
has, which being taken in due time, and so preserved, are here at home
esteemed and worn.

The next in greatness, is called a Wake, in regard of the great noise he
makes when he flies, The wake.
which resembles what he is called by, and of these there is great abundance,
who for the most part live upon their Rice grounds, and in those times do them
great spoils: they are very good to eat, and is a bird of a great stature,
having the upper part of his head carrying a beautiful show, with a pleasing
tuft on his Crown, which I have seen worn by great personages here at home.

There is infinite store of another sort of excellent birds which we call
Ginney Hens, in bigness Ginney hens.
much about our Phesants, and in beauty answerable; his feathers being all laid
over him like unto eyes, in a pleasing fashion, they are all the country over,
and in flocks of many hundreds together; their food is upon their corn
grounds, keeping close together, insomuch as we have killed eight of them at
one shoot, they are an excellent meat, and many of these are brought into
England, and given as presents to those of note, and worthy persons who
preserve and keep them for their rareness, as birds of pleasure: And in the
very like abundance they have Patridges, whose color is not beautiful, so
much as our Patridges here; but only of a dark feather, and these are
likewise all the country over, where it is planted, for the most remaining
near their houses, and in the middle of their dwellings, the great Patridges.
plenty of both which kinds, of Gynney Hens and Patridges, are some manifest
tokens there are no Foxes at all in the country, who are in these our parts
great enemies to both the kinds of Phesant and Patridge: and the cause the
keep so near the houses, is to preserve them from as subtle enemies, which
are the Babownes, and Munkeys, who are no night walkers, and in the day time
the recourse of people makes them keep further off, whereas otherwise they
would not fail to be sharers. There are also great store of Quails, who are
in bigness Quails.
as great as a Woodcocke, and from whence it is derived I cannot avouch, only
it is said, they are of those kind of Quails as fell among the children of
Isreal's tents: thus much I can affirm, they are a pleasing and delightful
meat, and in many places, where we have made abode, they have accustomed to
sall about us: so as provided wherewithal to shoot them, men's dyets are
mended, even in a short warning: In all their towns and dwellings likewise
store of Pigeons, which feed upon the Pigeons.
offall of their Corn, in the very doors, yet all are wild, and of tame
Pigeons they have no knowledge: I have with my stone-bow or pelletbow in two
hours killed twenty Pidegeons, even among their houses, which manner of
shooting they have had in vvonderfull admiration: And these birds or foul
nominated, are such that are at all times, and in most places ever near at
hand, and alvvayes ready for sustenance if men be provided, and will take
small pain to look them.

There are likewise in the country Parats, but none good for ought, except the
dun Parat with the red tail, of which fort you have some few that come to

which many are in colors, delightful to the eye, and many in notes very
pleasing to the ear: there is amongst the variety one small bird, which for his
strangeness we observe, he has no legs, but two strings like the bird of
Arabia, with which he hangs with his head downward, and has such resemblance
to a dead leaf, as it hangs on the tree, being direct of that A small bird

and he does seem to take pleasure to deceive men's eyesight, hanging wondrous
steady, without motion, whilst he is looked after, and very near the
touching: Likewise another A bird with four wings, about the bigness of a
turtle Dove.
strange bird there is, which flies with four wings we see him not all the
day, but an hour before night, his two foremost wings are largest, the other
are a pretty distance backward, and bears his body between four palpably.

As I speak of these birds, it is very necessary I should set down how nature
teaches these little creatures to provide for the safety of themselves, and
the young they bring forth, I have showed before, what troops and multitudes
of Babownes and Monkeys the country is stored withal, which are professed
enemies to feathered foul, and therefore in these little poor creatures, who
can make no resistance, Nature has directed them by Art to prevent cruelty:
Amonst the great variety of strange trees, and woods, which the country
affords, whereof there is not any, that I can know, or call by an English How
the birds preserve their young, from the Babouns, and Munkyes.
name, by saying, this tree does grow in England: there is especially one, who
does exceed in prickles, both upon the body, branches, and arms: even to the
outermost small springges, many of these grow distant from the water, and many
of them grow upon the bank side, hanging their tops over the water: we
observe, that of this only tree, the little Bird makes choice, and not content
with his defense of prickles, makes use likewise of his growing over the water,
and on that side which bends to the river on the very outside do they wind
their nestes with an owse, or neck, which is hollow, made of reeds and sedge,
the whole neast hanging like a bottle, made fast by the neck, in some places
so thick together, that the same side of the tree, seems as it were all
covered with thatch; unto which, if notwithstanding the prickles, the Babown or
Munkey durst approach, the fear he shall have, that the boughs will not
bear him, and the fall he is in danger of, together with the fright of the
water underneath him, is able to daunt him, by which natural care he preserues
his increase, and speedes better then many times the Parrat does, for he
likewise is provident to make his neast on the outermost smallest twigge of a
tree; but on the land winding it about the twigge, so near, as it will not
bear any of his unhappy enemies, who notwithstanding are vigilant for their
own ends, and by getting upon upper boughs, will ouerlooke his desired prey,
and when he sees they are grown to fill up the neast, will hazard charily as
the bough may bear him, and sitting fast with his two hinder feet with his
two hands take up the bough, and shake it in that manner, that either some The

or all forth of the nest shall tumble, and being down he gains them for his
labor. Another kind of art, nature has taught these birds in the high bank

and of that equal distance the one by the other, so thick Another means of
preservation.
as the bank will bear, carrying them at least a yard within the ground, by
which places they preserve themselves and their young.

But there are birds of defense such as are hawks, whereof there is one sort,
as large as our Ierfauchon, and these as the people tell us, will of their own

other sorts that live upon prey, whose manner of breeding, is in the open
trees, and by the continual watching and attending the nest, they are ready to
defend and save their young. There are no great Eagles but of a kind of small
bastard Eagles infinite store, and likewise several sorts Bastard Eagles.
of ravening Kites and Buzzards, whereof the skin of one sort smells wondrous
sweet and strong, after the savor of the Crocodile: These sorts are easily to
be discerned: for if at any time, we happened to kill a beast in the woods,
whereby any blood were discovered, although there were scarce any one of these
ravening birds to be seen, almost instantly, you should have such troops of
all sorts come in, as were able to devour the whole carkas, if we were not
present to affront them: And the only means the people have to find out
either Elephant, or any other beast, as they dye, or come to an untimely end,
amongst How the people find the dead beasts.
the thick woods, or high reeds, is by observing and keeping watch to look
out where these ravening birds gather together, which is easily discerned. the
nature of them being to sore, and fly in the air alost over the place where
their prey remains, to which place the people repair, and many times are
sharers in the booty: And to shut up this discourse, that it may appear how
likely it is, these birds and fowls may well increase, we do not see that
the people have any ingenious conceits, either by gins, The Inhabitants want
knowledge to take them.
or otherwise to kill or take of them: but upon any especial time, when the
King is determined to make a feast, they observe a course to take them, with
the rehearsal whereof I will make an end. The great command is sent, that all
people come abroad, and being in the fields, are set, and placed severally, of

them, that they are wearyed out, and the people with their hands take them up,
and bring them to the King, even to that number as may content him, with which
their Princely pastime I here conclude my story.

The Conclusion.
And for a final end do earnestly desire, that what is written may be taken
into consideration, thereby to stir up a more willing affection to prosecute
and go on in a timely proceeding upon this hopeful trade, which will crave
expedition in regard of these reasons following: First there is, as it were, a
certain combination made betwixt the people above and us, never to fail them
of a yearly trade, which they in their parts, (without all doubt) will
caresully expect, and as they have faithfully promised, will accordingly
provide for, and if in our parts, it should be neglected, may justly cause them
to take a great distrust of our fidelities, which in regard, we are now the
first white people they have seen, and have from them received such fair
approbation, may settle a distaste for the present very prejudicial, and among
such a barbarous people, we know not whether it may be easily removed. Again
the course we run, is allowable by our Laws, fitting and agreeing with the
peaceful time we live in, opposite to no neighbourly love or amity, neither
confronting any foreign Prince, by entering, or intermedling within any
forbidden territories, neither is it done in any warlike, or hostile manner,
but by the ancient and free Commerse, that unites nations, the course of
marchandizing, a commodious exchange answering to either side, wherein an
especial animation is, the certain knowledge we have gained in discovering
the golden trade of the Moors in Barbary, which was the first incourager and
beginning of this business, and for which the Adventures hitherto have been
laid, through the uncertainty whereof, those losses and mischances that have
happened, fell out, and therefore now should with a more settled resolution be
followed to regaine, by knowledge, what ignorance miscarryed in. And I may
join with this, the familiar conversation, fair acceptance, and mutual
amity, we find the natives to embrace us withal, not only celaring our own
doubts, which before knowledge must of necessity be, but likewise disproouing,
and altogether confounding the report and speeches of all those, who, to serve
their own ends, gave out, the people above to be a bloody and dangerous
nation.

Again to advance the Aduenturer, let the already known and certain trade be
remembered, which in my own perfect knowledge I will make good, (against all
Maligners, and secret opposers) that in our staple and principal commodities,
it is not vented, but at ten for one profit; and admit the discovery
should not prove; yet there will be found places of trade sufficient, and that
within the limit of fair recourse, to vent and put of such a reasonable
proportion as shall bring a return of that advantage, as shall be able to
bear the charge of a further search, and likewise answer the expectation here
at home of any reasonable minded aduenturer, provided they do arm themselves
by knowledge, of what those things are which are vendible, and likewise how to
attain unto those places, and order their occasions, where those returns are
to be made; whereunto is added that the expectation is not long, in respect of
other voyages, when as the return is such, that within the compass of ten
months, the whole voyage is to be performed, both out and home, allowing the
ship to be set forth from London, and to to make their her return again.

Moreover by the last discovery, so many hundred miles up the River, all which
way is perfectly known, and from part to part observed, and every reach in
order by me set down, and carefully kept, which may not only clear any
doubts and difficulties in that already known way, but likewise enable the
judgment for passing further, and especially order and give directions, what
boats or vessels are most apt and proper to follow the discovery withal, as
well fot speedier passage, as also for the most advantage, to a more profitable
return.

And further we may take into consideration, how the times and seasons of the
year, are unto us discovered, that the turbulent and infectious seasons may
be provided for, and men advised the better to bear them, and provide for
themselves, whereby (as it shall please God to give a blessing) those
inconveniences may be avoided, which formerly have been fallen into, and
things more necessary carried along, which through ignorance heretofore have
been neglected, together with diverse other abuses, that by experience, no
doubt, may be amended.

And lastly, in taking leave of you the noble gentlemen Adventurers in this
hopeful Discovery, let me (under correction) say unto you, Be not
discouraged, let not the iangling dispositions of any, whom your own wisdoms
leads you to see aim only to make up their own ends, dis hearten you. And
if it please you examine the condition of what is past, which, if I mistake
not, may be this set down. The first adventure was lost, and miscarried
through want of Care and Judgment of those Seamen and Merchants who had the
managing, by overmuch trust of supposed friends, who should at the very best
have been no otherwise thought and conceited of, then suspicious enemies, The
vagrant Portingall.
who have now discovered themselves, which will ever stand for a warning to
avoid the like, and trusting them any further: And that is all you have for
that money.

The second may some-wayes be laid upon the Seamen, whose understanding
should have avoided unseasonable times, and especially Discretion should have
led them to have shunned watering in the very height of unseasonableness; but
it may be excused for want of experience, insomuch as there had never been any
trial made, so high in the River before to any effect, to discover the
vnholsomnesse, with the operation thereof, whereby so many of them lost their
lives, and brought again another loss upon you, wherein the power of God was
manifested, by whose only hand they fell, and those few that returned, were
sent to testify, what they had felt and fallen into, whereby you have gained a
perpetual knowledge, for obscruing seasonable times, for your better
proceeding hereafter, the valuation whereof being truly understood, may
advance the employment, which only remains in that loss, to make you
satisfaction.

And for this third and last, wherein mine eyes have been a witness, how
accounts are brought in, and perfected with you, I am ignorant, but I presume,
as bad as it was, what with the return that was made, and the remaynes brought
home, of the Cargazon that was sent, you cannot (being justly dealt withal)
receive any loss; but for gain, it was never intended toward you, the whole
business being carried by those you gave credit, and countenance unto, with an
absolute hand, to abate and discourage your desires, for wading further upon
these Adventures, as by the manner thereof appears, which I have already
particularly acquainted you withal, and unnecessary to be remembered here;
Only this remains, to make good, what I in careful duty desired to lay open
unto you, from whence that first intent, of giving that blow of discouragement
unto you, did arise: you have been since subject to diverse other incounters,
and all occasions are still earnestly pursued, to embrace that opportunity,
that will give leave or way to strike you; And whereas they seek to discourage
you, yet by all public and secret means can be devised, they both have and
do still address themselves, to proceed and go on in the same adventure, as
you both know, and have had just cause to except against. And apparent it is,
that notwithstanding you in your generous dispositions have sat down by the
loss, yet there is that have gained. But allow (if it please you) all had
been lost, if you shall again consider, what charges and expenses have been
laid forth, and disbursed in Discoueries of this nature, nay in those of far
less expectation; with the recoueries and satisfaction, that afterward they
have made, even to this our native Country, whereof I forbear examples, in
regard they are not hidden from your true and ingenious knowledge: Only in
regard of some great resemblance, that may be to this intended business, I may
commend to your considerations, the voyage into Muscouie, wherein the Merchants
have that long passage of so many hundred leagues up a River; and by a
customary trade, is brought to be held as an ordinary passage, the Country,
being fitted accordingly, by which use, it is now no other ways unto them,
then (as we may term it here) our Western passages up the River of Thames;
wherein were more probability for the attaining of this we aim at, in regard
our River is at all times open, and not subject to cold, nor those extreme
frosts, which to the Muscouy trade, are so great hinderers: So that if you
would conclude amongst your selves, of a sufficient stock, and be armed with
a bancke, the ground of merchandising, to follow resolutely your undertaken
enterprise, For so much as to me belongs, I dare affirm, you are upon the
most promisingst occasion, that ever in our little Island was undertaken, most
especial considering by how small a charge it may be perfected wherein as
experience has made me the Writer, to a^quaint you with each particular, So
likewise I ^^fe^ my self up, both with my life and fortunes, ^a^^ with my
vtermost endeavors, in your behalfes, (by Gods especial blessing) to bring to
perfection, what I have here related, which is left with my self, to your
worthy considerations.

FINIS.
