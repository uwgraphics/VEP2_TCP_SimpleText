The true report of the dysputacyon had and bego^ne in the conuocacyo^ hows at
london among the clargye there assembled the xviij. day of October in the
year of our lord M.D.LIIII.

i. Johan. iiij. Prove every spyryte whether they be of god or no. To the
Christen reader.
IT is not unknown to the world / Christen reader / what variety and
contencio^ has been about weyghti matters of religion for a great space / which
were thought to have been so disiussed debated and examined of our clergy /
that all men were in hope that such an uniformity agreeable to the word of god
/ to the doctrine of the patriarkis and apostles and to the order of the
primative church also / had been determined for our church of Ingland / that
from hensforth one should have lived with a another in much better unity and
godli quietness than in mani years before they had done: every one embracing
one sincere manner of worshipping and inuocacion off god / wythowt any
supersticion / idolatry or hipocrisy that has in process of time crept in by
the divise and fantasy of man's brain. And the thing was brought to such a
point that all men / in manner / were wo^n to a wonderful in differency / and
bega^n to epsy their ignorance and errors wherewyth they have been heretofore
blinded and seduced, But the awncient aduersari of man kind / Satan / which
never cease to seek how he may destroy the works of god in us / enuieng
that unity in true religion that all men of all agis statis and degreys as
well high as low / had in manner atteyned and were well nigh comne unto / has
now stirred up the old co^tencio^ again bringing the weak unlearned and simple
sort thereby in to such a dowt and wavering that they can now lesser tell what
they may bileue and which way they may steye their faith and constiencys than
ever they could before. But as the great prophet (as Moses names him) the
son^ of god does prophecy and wytnes / that offe^cys must nedis come / and that
such offenses should come that even the very elect / (yff it were possible)
should be seduced / now we see with our eyes and grope with our sensys that it
is comne to pass and fullfilled even among us. But let them take heed that
have been the auctors thereoff ffor as it seruyth for the proving and tryeng of
gods elect (to whom all things work to the best) even so shall it serve to
their woo and utter damnacion / as he says that knows all thingis (ve homini
illi per quem scandalum venit) woo unto that man through whom offense does come.
And let the godly sort now rejoice in the cross of christ / for they have no
less cause / for as much as by this te^ptacyo^ they have the same toke^ that
their professyo^ is the true religyo^ of god / which all the true byleuers
evermore from time to time have had / that is to say / christys cross the
token that can not deceive us / and with out the which we can not be / yff we
will be sure to live godly in christ / as holy. s. Paul says. But now to my
purpose as in other poi^tys much varietye of opinyo^s hatth been / even so in
the high misterye of christys supper (which was instituted to be a sacrament of
concord / love and unity) the difference and diuersytie of opynio^s there
about has brought to pass that more dyscord / dissension and diuisyon has
grown among men about that than in any other one article of our christen
religyon. And therefore they whose subscripcyon was required in the conuocacyon
holden at powlys at the last parliament / judged not amysse / that thought it
necessary to reason and dispute therein before they would subscrybe to any
conclusyon or determynate sentence. And to the intent that all men may know
and see what reasons and answers were made on both partys / I have thought good
to publyssh so much thereoff as came unto my handis / trusting that no man will
be more offended with the setting forth thereoff / to the intent that such as
were not present may read such thingys as there were done and said / no more
than they were that all that were present should hear them / and judge
indyfferently by the toch stone of gods word / on which part the truth does
remain. Which / men may well goo about to suppress / but when they have done
all they ca^ against it / yet will it out and have the over hand. God grant
that all men may seek and study for the truth and not suffer the^ seluys to be
carried about nor changed with every blast of strange doctrine / nor with every
fantastycall fable of Antychrystys mynysters. Amen.

And as by readyng and weyng the reasons and answers of this dysputacio^ I dowt
not but thou shall be sussycie^tly confyrmed in the truth of the artycles
therei^ reasoned and debated / even so in a little treatise of the true
sacryfyce of a christian man which by gods grace shall shortly also be set forth
/ thou shall be instructed what to judge off other artycles / as of the mass /
of altarys / of the inuocatyon of sayntys / and such like. And now that we see
how gods wrath is bent over our nacyon / that we may now well say with dauyd /
O god / heathen people are enteryd in to thine inherytans. (For now Antychrystys
generacyo^ thinck to stablish their kingdom in England for ever) let all
faithful hartis yoyne them seluis together in unfeigned and co^tynuall prayer
that god will have mercy upon us and defend us against them / that the light of
his word which has now nys shyned up on us o may both be preserved among us /
and also preserve us against all the practices and enterpryses of his enemies
Amen.

The true report of the disputacyon had and bego^n in the co^uocacyon hows at
london the xviij. of October. An^o Dn^i. M.D.LIIII.
WHereas diverse and uncertain rumors be spread abroad of the disputacyon had in
the conuocacyon hows / to the intent that all men may know the certentye of
all things therein done and said as much as the memory of him that was present
thereat can bear a way / he has thought good at request / thoroughly to
descrybe what was said therein o^ both parts of the matters argued and had in
questyon and of the entrans thereoff.

First up on wedynsday being the xviij. day off october at affter noone /
master weston the prolocutor certified the hows that it was the quenys pleasure
that the company of the same hows be^yg many learned me^ assembled / should
debate of matters of religion and co^stitute laws thereoff / which her grace
and the perlame^t would ratifye. And for that there is a book of late set forth
/ called the cathechysme (which he showed forth) beari^g the name of this
honorable Synody / and yet putt forth with out your co^sentis / as I have
learned / being a book very pestiferos / and full of heresies (as he said) and
like wise the book of common prayer / very abhomynable (as it pleased him to
term it) he thought it therefore best first to begyn^ with the artycles of the
cathechysme concerning the sacrament of the altar / for to co^fyrme the
natural presens of christ in the same / and for transsubstantyacyon. In the
which on friday next ensewyng / he wylled all men there freely to speak their
tonsciens and lerning / and they should be fully satysfyed.

The friday coming being the xx. of October / when men had thought they should
have ent^yd disputacyo^ of the q^st^o^s proposed / the prolocutor did exhybyte
ij. several billys unto the hows: the one for the natural prese^s of christ in
the sacrament of the altar / the other co^cerni^g the cathechisme / that it was
not of that hows agreame^t set forth and that they do not agree thereunto.
Requyryng all them to subscrybe to the same as he himsylf had done: whereunto
the whole hows did i^medyately assent except vi. which were the deane of
rochester the deane of exceter / the archdeacon of wynchester / the archdeaco^
of hertford / the arthdeaco^ of stowe and one other / And while the rest were
about to subscribe these ij. articles. I. filpot stood up and spoke first
concerning the article of the cathechysme that he thought they were deceived in
the title of the cathechisme / in that it bearyth the title of the Synod of
london last before this / all though mani of the^ which tha^ were present were
never made pryuy thereof in setting it forth / for that this hows had granted
the auctorytye to make ecclesyastical lawys unto certain persons to be appointed
by the kyngys majesty / and what soever ecclesyasticall laws they or the most
part of the^ did set forth according to a statute in that behalf provided / it
might be well said to be do / ne in the synod of london although such as be of
this hows now had no notyce thereof, before the promulgacio^. And in this point
he thought the setterfurth thereoff nothing to have slandred the hows / as they
by their subscripcyon went about to persuade the world / sins they had our
synodall authority unto them committed to make such spiritual lawys as they
thought convenient and necessary. And more over he said as concerning the
article of the natural presens in the sacrament / that it was aga^yst reason
and order of lernyng and also very preiudicyall to the truth that me^ should be
mouid to substribe before the matter were thoroughly examined and discussed. But
wha^ he saw that allegacyo^ might take no place / being as a man astoyned at
the multitude of so mani learned me^ as there were off purpose gathered together
to mainteyne old tradicyo^s more than the truth of gods holy word / he made his
request unto the prolocutor- that where as there were so many awncyent learned
me^ present on that side as in the realm the like again were not to be fownd
in such number / and that on the other side of them that had not subscrybed /
were not past.v. or vi. both in age and lerning far inferyor unto the^ /
therefore that equalite might be had in this disputacyo^ he desyered that the
prolocutor would be a mean unto the lords that some of those that were learned
and setters forth of the same cathechisme might be brought in touthe hows to
show their lerning that mouyd the^ to set forth the same / And that D. rydley
and master rogers with ij. or iij. moo might be lycensed to be present at this
disputacio^ and to be associate with the^. This request was thought reasonable
and was proposed unto the lord bisshops who made this answer that it was not in
them to call such parsonis unto our hows / syns some of them were prisoners.
But they said they would be petiyoners in this behalff unto the cowncell / and
in case any were absent that ought to be of the hows / they willed the^ to be
taken in unto them / yff they listed. Affter this they minding to have enterid
in to disputacyon / there came a gentleman a messenger from the lord great
master signyfieng unto the prolocutor that my lord great master and the earl of
deauonshyre would be present at the disputacyons / and therefore he differryd the
same until monday at one of the clock at affternone.

Up on mo^day the xxiij. of October at the time appointed / in the presens of
many earlys / lordis / knyghtis / gentlemen and diverse other of the coint and
of the city also / the prolocutor made a protestacyo^ that they of the hows /
had appointed this disputacio^ / weston
not to call the truth in to dowt / to the which they had already all
subscribed / saving v. or v^. but that those gain sayers might be resolved of
their argume^tis in the which they stood / as it shall appear unto you / not
dowtyng but they will also co^descend unto us. Than he demanded of master
haddon whether he would reason against the q^styo^s proposed or no?

M. haddon
To whom he made answer that he had certyfyed him before by writing that he
would not / syns the request of such learned me^ as were demanded to be assyste^t
with the^ / would not be granted. M. Elmar
Master elmar likewise was asked / who made the prolocutor the like answer /
addyng moreover this / that they had done to much prejudice all ready to the
truth / to substrybe before the matter was discussed: and little or nothing it
might avail to reason for the truth / syns all they were now determined to the
contrary. Affter this he demanded of master chenye who^ the prolocutor said
allowed the presens with them / but he denied the tra^ssubstancyacyon / by the
meanis of certain auctorityes upon the which he sto^deth and desyereth to be
resolved / M. cheyny^s obietcyons.
as you shall hear whether he will propose his dowtis concerning
tra^ssubsta^cyacyo^ or no Yea / quoth he / I would glady mi dowtes to be
resolved which move me not to believe transsubsta^cyacion. The first is out of
the scripture of s. Paull to the corinthyans who speaking of the sacrament of
the body and blood of christ calls it offt tymis bread / affter the
consecracyon. The second is out off Orygen / who speaking of this sacrament
says that the materyal part theroff goyth down to the excrementis. The third
is out of theodoretus who making mencyon of the sacrame^tall bread and wine
after the co^secracyon says that they goo not out of their former substance /
form and shape. These be some of my dowtis among many other which I require to
be answered off. Than the prolocutor assigned D. Moreman to answer him.
Moremans aaswer to s. Paul.
Who to. s. Paull answered him thus / that the sacrament is called bread by him
in deed / but it is thus to be understand that it is bread off the sacrame^tall
bread / that is / the form of bread. Master cheynyes replycacion.
Than mastery cheny / inferred and alleged that hifichyus calls the
sacrament both bread and flessh. Yea / quoth moreman / hyfichyus calls it
bread because it was bread and not bycaus it is so. And passing over oryge^ he
came to theodoretus / and said that me^ mistoke his auctoryte / by interpreting
a general in to a special / as peter martyr has done in that place of
theodoret / Moremans answer to theodorete. marcke this answer and shyyfft.
interpreting / ousia / for substance / which is a special signyficacion of
the word. whereas ousia is a general word as well to accyde^ce as to
substance. And therefore I answer thus unto Theodoret that the sacramental bread
and wine do not goo out of their former substance form and shape / that is to
say / not out of their accidental substance and shape. Affter this master
theny sat him down / and by and by master elmar stood up / M. elmar.
as one that could not abide to hear so fond an answer to so grave an
auctorite / And reasonyd up on the auctorite of theodoret / alleagyd before by
master cheny and declared that moremans answer to theodoret was no just nor
sufficyent answer but an illusyon and a subtle euasyon contrary to Theodoretis
meaning. For / said he / yff (ousia) should signifye an accyde^ce in the place
alleged as it is answered by master moreman / than were it a word superfluos
set in theodorete / there where do follow ij. other wordis which sufficyently
do expownd the accyde^s of the bread / that is / eidos and shema / which
signifye in Inglysh / shape and form: And so very lernydly prouyd out of the
same auctor by diverse allegacyons that (ousia) in greek could not be so
generally taken in that place as moreman for a shyfft would have it. moremans
shifft is ouerthrown.
But morema^ as a man having no another salve for that sore affyrmed still that
(ousia) which signyfyeth substance / must nedis signifye accydental substance
properly. fylpots replicacyon / to moremans shyfft.
To whose importunyte syns he could have no another answer / elmar as a man
weryed with so long talk gave place. Affter this / stood up John fyllpot and
said that he could prove that by the matter that Theodoret entreated off in the
place above alleged and by the simylytude which he makyth to prove his purpose
/ by no meanis master moremans interpretacyon of (ousia) / might be taken for
accydentall substance as he for a shyfft would interpret yt to be. For the
matter which theodoret intreatyth off in that place is against eutyches an
heretyke which denied ij. naturys of substance to remain in christ being one
parson but that his humanytye affter thaccomplyshment of the mystery of our
salvation ascendyng in to heauyn and being yoyned unto the dyuynitie was
absorpt or swalowed up of the same / so that christ should be no more but of one
dyuyne substance only by his opinion. Against which opinion Theodoret wrytyth
and by the symylytude of the sacrament proves the contrary against the
heretyke / that like as in the sacrament of the body of christ affter the
consecracyo there is the substance of chrystis humanytye with the substance of
bread / remaynyng as it was before / not being absorpt of the humanitye of
christ but yoyned by the divine operacyo^ thereunto / Even so in the parson of
christ being now in heauyn of whom this holy sacrament is a representacyon /
there be ij. several substancys / that is / his dyuynytye and humanity united
in one hipostacy or parson / which is christ / The humanitye not absorpt by the
coniunccyon of the deitye / but remaini^g in his former substans. And this
similytude / quoth fyllpot / brought in of theodorete to confownd Eutyches /
should prove nothing at all / yff the very substance off the sacramental bread
did not remain as it did before / but yff D. Moremans interpretacion might
take place for transsubstancyacyon / than should the heretyke have thereby a
strong argument by theodoretis auctorytye so taken to maynteyne his heresy and
to prove him filff a good chryste^ man / and he might well say thus unto
theodorete. Like as thou theodoret yff thou were of D. Morema^s mind / doyst
say that affter the consecracyon in the sacrament the substance of the bread is
absorpt or tra^ssubstancyate in to the humane body of christ coming thereunto /
so that in the sacrament is now but one substance of the humanyte a lone and
not the substance of bread as it was before / even likewise may I affirm and
conclude by thine own similytude that the humanitye ascendyng up by the power of
god in to heauyn and adjoined unto the deytye was by the might thereoff absorpt
and turned into one substance with the deytye: so that now there remaynith but
one divine substance in christ / no more than in the sacramental sygnis of the
lordis supper affter the consecracyon do remain any more than one substance
according to your byleffe and co^struccyon. To this D. Moreman stackered in
answering / whose defect fyllpott perceiving / spoke on this wise. morema^
stacke ryh and can not tell what to answer. weston is offended.
Well master morema^ if you hauenota^ answer ready at this present / I pray you
diuyse one yff you can conveniently / against our next metyng here again: with
that his sayng the prolocutor was greuosly offended / tellyng him that he should
not bragg there / but that he should be fully answered. Than said filpot / It is
the thing that I only desire to be answered directly in this behalff / and I
desire of you and of all the hows at this present / that I may be sufficye^tly
a^swered / which I am sure you are not all able to do / saui^g theodoretis
autorite and similytude upright / as he ougt to be taken. No another answer was
made to fillpots reasons / but that he was commanded to sylens. Fylpot, it is
replicacyon answered by commanding hi^ to syle^ce
Tha^ stood up the deane of rochester offering hi^ sylff / to reason in the
first question against the natural presens wisshing that the scripture and the
awncyent doctors in this point might be weyed / byleuid and followed. And
against this natural presens he thought the sayng of christ in. s. Matthew to
make sufficiently enough / yff men would credit and follow scripture: who said
there of him selff that poor men we should have allweis with us / the deane of
rochester.
but him we should not have alweys / which was spoken / quoth he / concerning
the natural presens of christis body / therefore we ought to believe as he has
taught that christ is not naturally present on earth in the sacrament of the
altar. westo^s answer to the deane.
To this was answered by the prolocutor that we should not have christ present
allweyes to exercise alms dedis up on him / but up on the pore. But the deane
prosecuted his argument / and showed out of. s. Austen further / that the same
interpretacyon of the scripture alleged / The deanes replicacio^
was no sufficyent answer / who wrytych in the fyfftye treatise of s. Johan on
this wise of the same sentence. When as he said / says Austen / me shall ye
not have allweyes with you / he spoke of the presence of his body. For by his
majesty / by his prouydence / by his unspeakable and vysyble grace / that is
fullfylled which is said of him / behold I am with you until the consummacyon
of the world. A notable auctoritye out of. s. Auste^
But in the flessh which the wore took up on him / in that which was borne of
the virgyn / in that which was apprehended of the Iewys which was crucified on
the cross / which was let down from the cross / which was wrapped in clowtis
/ which was hidden in the sepulcher / which was manifested in the resurreccyon
/ you shall not have me allweyes with you. And why? For affter a bodily
presence he was conversant wih his discyples xl. eayes / and they accompanyeng
him by seeing and not by following / he ascendyd and is not here / for there he
sytteth at the right hand of the father / And yet here he is / because he is not
departed in the presens of his majesty. Affter a another manner we have christ
allweys by presens of his majesty / but affter the presens off his flessh it
is uprightly said you shall not verily have me allweys with you. For the church
had him in the presence of his flessh a few days / and now by faith it
apprehe^deth him and seyth him not with eyes. watso^s answer to s. Austen.
To this auctorite D. Watson took up on him to answer / and said he would
answer. s. Austen by. s. Austen / and having a certain book in his hand of notis
/ he alleged out of the xc. treatye up on. Fylpot against watson.
s. Joan that affter that mortal condicyon and manner we have not now christ on
the earth as he was heretofore before his passion. Against whose answer Johan
fillpott replied and said that watson had not fully answered. s. Austen by. s.
Austen as he would seem to have done / for that in the place above mencionyd by
master deane of rochester / he does not only teach the immortal state of
christis body before his passion / but also the immortal condicyo^ of the
same affter his resurrection / in the which mortal body. s: Austen semyth
plainly to affirm that christ is not present-vp on the arth neither in form
visibly neither in corporal substance inuisibly: As in few linis affter the
place above alleged. s. Auste^ does more plainly declare by these wordis /
sai^g / now these ij. manner af christis presence declared / which is by his
magestie / providence / and grace now present in the world which before his
ascensyon was present in flessh / being now placed at the right hand of the
father is abse^t in the same from the world / I thynk / (says. s. Austen) that
there remaynith no another question in this matter. Now / quoth fillpot / yff. s.
Austen acknowleged no more presence of christ to be now on earth but only his
divine presence / and towching his humanitye to be in heauyn / we ought to
confess and believe the same. But yff we put a third presens of christ / that
is corporally to be present allweys in the sacrament of the altar inuisibly /
according to your supposycions / whereoff. s. Austen makes no mencyon at all
in all his workis / you shall seem to judge that which. s. Auste^ did never
comprehend. Why / quoth watson. s. Auste^ in the place by me alleged makes no
mention how. s. Steuyn being in this world saw Christ affter his ascension. It
is true / said fyllpot / but he saw christ as the scripture tells / in the
heauyns being open / standing at the right hand of god the father. Further to
this / watson answered not. D. weston.
Than the prolocutor went about to furnyssh up an answer to. s. Austen / sayng
that he is not now in the world affter that manner of bodyly presence / but yet
present for all that in his body. To whom fyllpot answered that the prolocutor
did grate much up on this word / (secundum) in. s. Austen / which signifies
affter the manner / in form / but he does not answer to / (id quod) which is
that thing or substance of christ in the which christ suffered / arose / and
ascended in to heauyn In the which thing and substance he is in heauin and not
on earth / as. s. Austen in the place specyfyed most clearly does defyne. The
deane of rochester.
To this nothing else being answered / master deane of rochester procedid in the
maintenance of his argument and redd out of a book of annotacions / sundry
auctoryties for the confirmacio^ thereoff. moreman.
To the which moreman / who was appointed to answer him / made no direct answer
/ but bad hi^ make an argument / sayng master deane had recyted many wordis of
doctors but he made not one argument. Than said master deane / the auctorities
of the doctors by me rehearsed / be sufficient argumentis to prove mine intent /
to the which my desire is to be answered of you. But still moreman cried / make
an argument / to shifft off the auctorite which he could not answer unto.
Affter this master deane made this argument out of the institucyon of the
sacrament / (Do this in remembrance of me / and thus ye shall show forth the
lordis death until he commyth) The sacrament therefore is the remembrance of
christ / than it is not very christ for yet he is not comme. For this word /
(Until he comyth) does plainly signify the absens of chrystis body. weston.
Than the prolocutor meant about to show that this word / (Until he comyth /)
did not import any absence of christ on the earth / by other placis of
scripture where (donec) until / was placed as well as there / but directly to
the purpose he answered nothing. In conclusyon master deane fell to questyoning
of moreman whether christ ate the pasthalawb with his discyples or no? He
answered / yea. Further he demanded whether he ate likewise the sacrament with
them as he did instytute yt? Moreman answered Yea. Than he axed what he ate /
and whether he ate his own natural body as they ymagyne it to be / or no.
Than said master deane It is a great absurdytye by you granted / and so he sat
down. morema^ affirms that christ ato his own body.
Against this absurditye / filpot stood up and argued / sai^g he could prove by
good reason to be diducyd out of scripture / that christ ate not his own
natural body at the institucyon of the sacrament / and the reason is this.
The body of christ giuyn by the sacrament has a promise of remissyon of synnis
adyoyned / unto all the^ that receive it dewely / Fylpot.
but this promise could take no effect in christ / ergo christ ate not his own
body in the sacrame^g. moreman denies the sacrament to have a promise of
remissyon of sin annexed unto it.
To this reason morema^ answered / denienh the former part of the argument /
that the sacrament had a promise of remissyo of synnis annexed unto yt. Than
fillpot showed this to be the promise in the sacrament (Which is gyuyn for you /
which is shed for you for the remissyo^ of synnis) But moreman would not
acknowledge that to be any promise / so that he drove fyllpot to the vi. of Ioh.
to vouch his sayng with these wordis the bread which I will give / is my flessh
/ which I will give for the lyffe off the world. Moreman answering nothing
directly to this argument / harpsfeld affirms that which moreman his fellow
denied.
harpsfeld start up to supply that which wanted in his behalff / and thinkyng
to have answered fyllpott / confyrmed more strongly his argument / sayng / ye
mistake the promise which is annexed to the body of christ in the sacrament /
for it perteyned not to christ but to his discyples to whom christ said this is
my body which is given for you / and not for christ him sylff. You have said
well for me quoth fylpott / for that is mine argument. The promise off the body
of christ took no effect in christ / ergo christ ate not his own body. weston
also is contrary to more man.
Than the prolocutor to showlder out the matter / said the argument was naught
/ for by the like argument he might goo about to prove that christ was not
baptized / because che remissyon of synn which is annexed unto baptysme took no
effect in christ. fylpots argument is not soluted.
To the which / fyllpot replied that like as christ was baptized / so he ate
the sacrament / but he took on him baptism / not that he had any need the
reoff / or that it took any effect in him / but as our master / to give the
church an example to follow him in the ministracyon of the sacrament / and
thereby to exhibit unto us / him self / and not to give him self to him selff.
No more was said in this. But afterward the prolocutor demanded of filpot /
whether he would argue against the natural presence or no. To who^ he answered
/ yea yff he would hear his argument with out interrupcyon and assign one to
answer him and not many / which is a confusion to the opponent and specially
for him that was of an ill memori. By this time the night was co^ne on /
wherefore the prolocutor brake up the disputacyon for that time and appointed
fillpot to be the first that should beginn the disputacion the next day affter /
concerning the presence of christ in the sacrament.

On the wedinsday the xxv. of October / Iohnnfillpott / Filpot.
as it was before appointed / was ready to have entered the disputacyo^ myndyng
first to have made a certain oracyon and a true declaracyo^ in laten off the
matter of christis presens which was than in questyon which thing the prolocutor
perceiving / by and by he forbad fillpot to make any oracyon or declaracyon of
any matter / co^mandyng him also that he should make na argument in laten but to
conclude no his argumentis in Inglyssh. Than said fyllpott / this is contrary
to your order taken at the beginning of this disputacyon: For than you
appointed that all the argumentis should be made in laten. And thereupon I have
drawn and diuysed all my argume^tis in laten. And because you / master
prolocutor / have said heretofore openly in this hows that I had no lerning / I
had thought to have showed such lerning as I have / in a brefe oracyon and
short declaracyon of the questyons now in controversy: thynkyng it so most
convenient also / that in case I should speak otherwise in my declaracyon than
should stand with lerni^g or than I were able to warant and iustyfye by gods
word / it might the better be reformyd by such as were learned of the hows / so
that the unlearned sort being present might take the less offense thereat. But
this allegacyon prevailed nothing with the prolocutor who bad him still form
an argument in Inglyssh or else to hold his peace.

Than said fyllpot. You have sore dysapoynted me thus suddenly to goo from your
former order / but I will accomplysh your commandment leauyng mine oracyon a
part And I will come to my argume^tis / the which as well as so sode^ a warnyng
will serve I will make in Inglyssh. But before I bring forth any argument I will
in one word declare what manner of presens I do dysallowe in the sacrament to
the intent the hearers may the better understand to what end and effect mine
argumentis shall tend: not to deny utterly the presence of christ in his
sacrame^tis trewely ministryd according to his institucyon / but only to deny
that gross and carnal presens which you of this hows have allredy substrybed
unto to be in the sacrament of the altar contrary to the truth and manifest
meaning of the scrypturys / That by transsubsta^cyacyon of the sacrame^tall
bread and wine christis natural body should by the virtue of the wordis
pronownced by the pryst be contained and included under the formis or
accydentys of bread and wine. This kind of presens ymagyned by men / I do
deny / quoth fyllpot / And against this I will reason: But before he could
make an end of that he would have said he was interrupted of the prolocutor /
and commanded to desce^d to his argument. At whose unjust importunite fyllpot
being offe^and thincking to purchase him a remedy therefore / he fell down up on
his kneys before the earls and lords which were there present / being a great
number / whereof some were of the quenis cowncell / beseching the^ that he might
have liberty to prosecute his argumentis with out interrupcyon of any man: the
which was ge^tilly granted him of the lordis. But the prolocutor putti^g in ure
a point of the practyse of prelatis / would not condescend thereunto / but still
cried hold your peace or else make a short argument. I am about it / quoth
fyllpot / yff you would let me alone. But first I must nedis axe a question of
my respondent (who was. D. chedsey) concerning a word or twain of your
supposycion / that is / of the sacrament of the altar / what he meanyth
thereby / and whether he take as some of the awncyent writers do / termyng the
lordis supper the sacrament of the altar / because it is a sacrament of that
lively sacrifyce which christ offered for our synnis up on the altar of the
cross and because that chrystis body crucified for us was that blody sacrifyee
/ which the blood shedyng of all the beastis offered up on the altar in the
old law did prefigurate and signify unto us. And in signifycacyon thereoff /
the old writers sometime do call the sacrament of the body and blood of christ
/ among other namis which they astrybe thereunto / the sacrament of the altar
and that right well. But yff you take it other wise / as for the sacrament of
the altar which now a days is made of lime and stone and hangen over the same
/ and to be all one with the sacrament of the mass / as it is at this present
in many placis / chedscy
than I will direct mine argumentis according as your answer shall give me
occasyon. Than made D. chedsey this answer that in their supposicyon they took
the sacrament of the altar and the sacrament of the mass to be all one.
Fillpot speaks plain Inglyssh.
Than quoth fyllpott / I will speak plain Inglyssh / as Master prolocutor
wylleth me / and make a short resolucyon thereof / that that sacrament of the
altar which ye reken to be all one with the mass / onys justly abolisshed and
now put in full use again / is no sacrament at all / neither is christ in any
wise present in yt: And this his sai^g he offered to prove before the hole hows
/ yff they lysted to call him thereunto / and likewise offered to vouch the
same before the quenis grace and her most honorable cowncell / before the face
of vi. of the best lernyd men of the hows of the contrary opinyon / he refused
none. And yff I shall not be able / quoth he / to mainteyne by gods word that I
have said / and confownd those vi. which shall take up on the^ to with stand me
in this point / let me be burned with as many fagots as be in london / before
the court gates. This he uttered with a great vehemence of spirit. At this /
the prolocutor with diverse other / were very much offended / dema^ding of him
whether he wist what he said or no. Yea / quoth fyllpott I wot well what I
say: defieryng no mann to be offended with his sayng / for that he spoke no
more than by gods word he was able to prove. And praised be god quoth he / that
the quenis grace has granted us off this hows (as our prolocutor has informed
us) that we may freely utter our consciences in these matters of controversy in
religyon. Here weston confuteth fylpot mightily.
And therefore I will speak here my conscie^s freely / grownded up on gods holy
word for the truth: Albeyt some off you here present mislyke the same. Than
diverse of the hows besydys the prolocutor / tawnted and reprehended him / for
speaking so vnfaryngly against the sacrament of the mass / And the prolocutor
said he was mad and threatened him / that he would send him to prison yff he
would not cease his speaking.

Than fylpot seeing him selff thus abused / and not permitted with free liberty
to declare his mind / fell in to an exclamacyon / castyng his eyes up towardis
the heauyn and said / O lord what a world is this / O lord what means this
world / that the truth of thy holy word may not be spoken and abidden by? And
for very sorrow and heaviness the tearis trykled out of his eyes. Affther this /
the prolocutor being mouth by some that wore about him / was content that he
should make an argument so that he would be viefe therein. Fillpot
I will be as brefe / quoth filpot / as I may co^uenie^tli be in vttri^g all
that I have to say. And first I will beginn to grownd mine argumentis up on the
auctorities of scriptures / where up on all the bylding of our faith ought to
be grownded. And affter I shall confirm the same by ancient doctores of the
church. And I take the occasion of my first argument out of the xxiiij. of
Matthew of the sayng of the angel to the iij. Maryes seking christ at the
sepulcher saing / he is risen / he is not here: and in. s. luke in the xxiij.
chap. the angel asks them / whi they sought him that lives among the dead?
Like wise the scripture testifies that christ is risen / ascended in to heaven
and sits on the right hand of the father: all the which is spoken of his
natural body / ergo it is not on earth included in the sacrament. I will
confyrme this yet moie effectually by the saing of christ in the xvi. of. s.
John. I came says christ / from my father in to the world / and now I leave
the world and goo a way to my father. The which coming / and going / he meant of
his natural body / therefore we may affirm thereby that it is not now in the
world. But I look here / quoth he / to be answered with a bli^d distinction of
visibly and inuisibly / that he is visibly departed in his humanite / but
inuisibly he remains not withstonding in the sacrament: but that answer I
proue^t my sylff that with more expedicyon I may descend to the pyth of mine
arguments whereof I have a dosen to propose / and will prove that no such
distinccyon may take away the force of that argument / by the answer which
his disciples gave unto christ speaking these words / now thou speakyst
plainly and vtteryst forth no proverb: which wordis. s. cyryll interpreting
faith that christ spoke with out any manner of impedy of obscure speech / And
therefore I conclude hereby / thus: that yff christ spoke plainly and with out
parable / (as me^ say) saing / I leave / the world now / and goo a way to my
father / tha^ that obscure / dark and imperceptyble presens of christ's
natural body to remain in the sacrament up on earth inuysibly contrary to the
plain wordis of christ / ought not to be allowed: For nothing can be said more
uncertain / or more parabolycall and vnsensyble tha^ so to say. Here now will I
atte^d what ye will answer / and so descend to the co^fyrmacyon of all that I
have said by awncyent writers. thed seys answer to fyllpot.
Than D. ched sey recityng his argument in such order as it was made / made
answer seuaerlly to every part thereoff / on this wise First to the saing of
the angel / that christ is not here / And why seek ye the living among the
dead / he answered that these sayngis perteined nothing to the presens of
christ's natural body in the sacrament / but that they were spoken of christ's
body being in the sepulcher when the iij. maryes thought him to have been in
the grave still. And there for the angel said / why do ye seek him that liuyth
among the dead. And to the auctorite of the xvi-of John where christ says /
Now I leave the world and goo to my father / he meant that of his ascensyon /
and so likewise did ciryl / interpreting the saing of the disciples that knew
plainly that christ would visibly ascend in to heauyn / but that yet does not
exclude his invisible presens of his natural body in the sacrament. For s.
Chrysostom writing to the people of Antioch does affirm the same / comparing
Helyas and christ to gether / and helias clooke unto Christis flessh. Helias /
quoth he / when he was taken up in the fiery charet / lefft his clooke behind
him unto his disciple helyseus / But christ ascendyng in to heauyn took his
flessh with him / and lefft also his flessh behynd him. Whereby we may right
well gather that christis flessh is visibly astended in to heaven and inuisibly
abides still in the sacrament of the altar. fyllpot replied.
To this answer / fyllpot replied / and said that he enforced not his argument
up on the sayng of the angel / (Christ is risen and is not here) / but took
his beginning thereby to proceed as before is rehearsed: to the process whereof
you have not thorowli answered / for I procedyd further / as thus / he is ryse^
/ ascended and sits at the right hand of god the father ergo he is not
remaining on the earth. Neither is your answer to ciryl / by me alleged /
sufficient: but by and by I will return to your interpretacyo^ of cyryll and
more plainly declare the same / affter that I have first refelled the
auctorite of chrysostom which is one of your chief principles that you allege
to make for your gross carnal presens in the sacrament / the which being well
weyd and understand pertains nothing thereunto. At that the prolocutor
starcled that one of the chief pillars in this po^t should be ouertrhowe^ / and
therefore recyted the said authority in laten first / and affter ward Inglisshed
the same / willi^g all that were present to note that sai^g of chrisosto^ /
which he thought invincible on their side. But I shall make it appear / quoth
fylpot / by and by to make little for your purpos. And as he was about to
declare his mind in that behalff / the prolocutor did interrupt him as he did
almost continually / where with fyllpot not being content / said / Fillpot is
inteerupted.
master prolocutor thinks that he is in a sophistrye scole where he knows
right well the manner is that when the respo^dent perceives that he is like to
be enforced with an argument to the which he is not able to answer tha^ he does
what he ca^ with cauyllacyon and interrupcio^ to drive him from the same. This
sayng of fylpot was ill lyked of the prolocutor and his adherentis: and the
prolocutor said that fillpot could bring nothing to avoid that autorite but
his own vain ymaginacio^. Hear / quoth fyllpot / and affterward judge. For I
will do in this as in all other auctorityes you shall charge me with in
refellyng any of my argumentis that I have to prosecute answering either unto
the same by sufficient auctorities of scripture / or else by some other
testimoni of like authority / and not of mine own ymaginacio^: the which yff I
do / I will it to be of no credyte. And concerning the sayng of chrysostom / I
have ij. ways to beat him from your purpose / the one out of scripture / the
other out of chrysostom him selff in the place here by you alleged. First
where he seems to say that christ ascending / took his flessh with him / and
lefft also his flessh behind him / truth it is: for we all do confess and
believe that christ took on him our humane nature in the virgi^ maryes womb /
and through his passion in the same has united us to his flessh / and thereby
are we beco^ne one flessh with him / so that chrysostom might therefore right
well say / that christ ascending took his flessh which he receiuid of the
virgin mary / a way with him: And also lefft his flesh behind him / which are
we / that be his elect in this world / which are the members of christ / and
flessh of his flessh: as very aptli. s. Paul to the ephesians in the iiij.
chapter does testifye sayng we are flessh of christ's flessh and bones of his
bonis / And if percase any man will affirm that he entreats there of the
sacrament so that this interpretacyon ca^ not so aptly be applied unto him in
that place / than will I yet interpret chrysostom a another way by him sylff.
For in that place in few lines before thoo words which were here no rather
redd are these words red / that christ affter he ascended in to heauyn lefft
unto us indewed with his sacrame^tis / his flessh in misteryes / that is
sacramentally. And that mistycall flessh / christ leaves as well to his church
in the sacrament of baptism as in the sacramental bread and wine. And that.
s. Paul justly does wytnes / saing / as many of us as are baptized in christ
have put up on us Christ. And thus you may understand that s. chrysostom
makes nothing for your carnal and gross presence in the sacrament as you
wrongfully take him. Pie and weston rownd to gether.
Now in this mean while master pie rownded the prolocutor in the ear to put
fyllpot to silence and to appoint some other / mystrustyng lest he would
shrowdly shake their carnal presence in conclusyon / yff he held on long /
seeing in the beginning he gave one of their chief fowndacyo^s such a pluck.
weston.
Than the prolocutor said to fyllpot / that he had reasoned sufficiently enough
/ and that some other should now supplye his romth. Where with he was not well
content / saing / whi sir I have a dussen arguments concerning this matter to
be proposed and I have not yet searse ouergone my first argument / for I have
not brought in any confirmacyon thereof out of any awncyent writer / whereoff I
have for the same purpose many / being hitherto still let by your offt
interrupting of me. Fillpot is commanded to silence note this gear
Well / quoth the prolocutor / you shall speak no more now and I command you
to hold your peace. You perceive / quoth fyllpot / that I have stuff enough for
you / and am able to withstand your falls supposicyon and therefore you command me
to silence. Fillpot is threatened to prison. A good solucyo^ for all his
argumences
If you will not give place / quod the prolocutor / I will send you to pryso^.
This is not / quod fyllpot / according to your promise made in this hows / nor
yet according to your bragg made at pawlys cross that me^ should be answered in
this disputacion to what so ever they ca^ say / Syns you will not suffer me of
a dussen argume^tis to prosecute one. Tha^ M. pie took upon him to promise that
he should be a^swered a another day. Filpot seeing he might not proceed on his
purpos being there with iustli offended / e^nded: saing thus: a fight of you
here / which heiherto have lurked in corners and dissembled with god and the
world / are now gathered to gether to suppres the si^cere truth of gods holy
word / and to set forth eueri false de which by the catholic doctrine of the
scripture / ye are not able to maynteyne. M. elmar.
Than stepped forth master elmer chaplin to the duke of suffolk whom master
moreman took up on him to answer / against whom master elmer obyected diverse
and sundry auctorytyes / for the confyrmyng of the argument he took the day
before in hand to prove that (ousia) in the sentence of Theodorete brought in
by master cheyny / must needs signify substance and not accidence / whose
learned reasons and clerkly approbacions because they were all grownded and
brought out of the greek / I do pass them over for that they want their grace
in Inglissh / And also their propre understanding. But his allegacyons so
incombred master morema^ that he desieryd a day to over vewe the^ / for at that
instant he was with out a convenient answer. morema^ desiereth a day to
imagine some crafty shift.
Than did the prolocutor call master haddo^ deane of exceter and chaplyn to the
duke of suff. who prosecuted theodoretis authority in confirmyng master elmers
argument: to who^ D. watson took up on him to give answer / who affter long
talk was so confownded that he was not able to answer to a certain word
(Misterium / watson co^fownded by. M. haddon
) but for as much as he seemed to dowt therein / master haddon took out of his
bosom a latyne aucthor to confirm his saing / and showed the same to master
watson / asking him whether he thought the translacyon to be true or that the
prynter were in any fawt. watson for a bare shifft puts a fawt in the
printer.
There may be a fawt in the pri^ter / quoth watson / for I am not rememberyd of
this word. Than did master haddon take out of his bosom a greek book / wherein
he showed forth with his fyngar the same words which master watson could not
deny. His argumentis further I omyt to declare at large because they were for
the most part in greek about the bulting out of the true significacyon of
(ousia). Than stepped forth master perne and in argument / M. perne.
made declaracyon of his mind against transsubstanciacyon and confirmed the
saings and auctorityes alleged by master elmer and master haddon: to who^ the
prolocutor a^swered / saing I much meruell / master perne / that you will say
thus / for so much as on friday last you substribed to the contrary. Which his
saing / master elmer did mislyke / saing to the prolocutor that he was to blame
so to reprehe^d any man / partly for that this hows / quod he / is an hows of
free liberty for every mann to speak his conscyens / weston praises their
lerning to flatter they but he answers not there arguments.
and partly for that you promised yesterday that not withstonding any man had
substrybed / yet he should have free liberty to speak his mind. And for that
the night did approach and the time was spent / the prolocutor gyuing them
praises for their lerning did yet not with stondyng conclude that all reasoni^g
set a part / the order of the holy rhurch must be receiuid and al things must
be ordered thereby.

On Friday the xxvii. of october / D. weston the prolocutor did first propownd
the matter showing that the co^uocacyon had spent ij. days in disputacio^
allreadi about one only Doctor / which was theodorete / and about one only
word which was (ousia.) Yet were they comne the third day to answer all things
that could be objected / so that they would shortly put out their arguments. M.
haddon and watso^.
So master haddon deane of exceter / desiered leave to appose master watson /
which with ij. other moo that is morgane and harpsfeld / was appoi^ted to
answer. Master haddon demanded this of him / whether any substance of bread
or wine did remain affter the consecracyon: Than master watson asked of him
again / whether he thought there to be a real presens of gods body or no?
Master haddo^ said it was not mete nor orderlyke / that he which was appointed
responde^t / should be opponent: and he whose duty was to obyect / should answer.
Yet master watson a long while would not agree to answer but that thing first
granted him. At last an order was set / and master haddon had leave to goo
forward with his argument. Than he proved by theodoretes words / a substance
of bread and wine to remain. For these are his wordis / the same they were
before the sanctificacyon / they are after. Master watson / said that
theodorete meant not the same substance but the same essence / whereupon they
were driven again unto the discussyng of the greek word (ousia) and master
haddon proved it to mean a substance / both by the etymology of the word and
by the wordis of the doctor. First / quoth he / it comes of the participle /
(on /) which descends of the verb / sum. And so the nowne (ousia). Than
master watson answered that it had not that significacyon only. Than master
haddon prouyd that it must medes so signify in that place and he axed / when
the bread and wine became symbolys: whereunto answer was made / affter the
consecracyon and not before. Than gathered master haddon this reason / out of
his auctor: The same thing / says theodorete / that the bread and wine were
before they were symbolys / the same they remain still in nature and substance
/ affter they are ssymbolys: bread and wine they were before / therefore bread
and wine they are affter Than master watson fell to the denial off the auctor
and said he was a nestoryan: watson is driven to a shameful shifft to deny
the auctor / when he can not answer
And he desiered that he might answer ts master cheyny / which stood by / for
that he was more mete to dispute in the matter / because he had granted and
substrybed unto the real presens. Master cheyny desiered patience of the
honorable me^ to hear him trusting that he should so open the matter that the
veryte should appear: protesting furthermore / that he was no obstynate nor
stubburne man / but would be comfortable to all reason. M. cheyny.
And yff they by their lernyng / which he acknowlegyd to be much more than his
/ could answer his reasons / that than he would be ruled by them and say as
they said / for he would be no auctor of schism nor hold any thing contrary to
the holy mother the church which is christis spowse. D. Weston liked this well
and commended him highly / saing that he was a well learned man / and a sober
man and well execused in all good lerning and in the doctors / and finalli a
man mete / for his knowledge / to dispute in that place / I pray you hear him /
quoth he Than master cheyny desyeryd such as there were present to pray ij. M.
chenys prayer.
wordys with him unto god / and to say (vincat veritas) let the veryte take
place and have the vyctory. And all that were present cried with a loud voice /
vincat veritas / vincat veritas. Than said doctor weston to him / that was
hipocryticall. Men may better say / quoth he / vicit veritas / Truth has gotten
the victory. Master cheyny said again yff he would give him leave he would bring
it to that point that he might well say so. M. cheny and watson.
Than he disputed with master watson affter this sort / you said that master
haddon was unmeet to dispute because he grants not the natural and real
presens / but I sape you are much more unmeet to answer / because you take a way
the substance of the sacrament Master watson said he had substribed to the
real presens and should not goo a way from that. So said weston also and the
rest of the pristis / in so much that off a great while he could have no leave
to say any more / till the lordis spoke and willed that he should be hard. Than
he told them what he meant by his subscribing to the real presence / far other
wise than they supposed: so than he went forward and prosecuted master haddons
argument in proving that (ousia) was a substance / vsyng the same reason that
master haddon did before him / and when he hadd received the same answer also
that was made to master haddon / he said it was but a lewd refuge / when they
could not answer / to deny the auctor. Yet he prouyd the auctor to be a
catholyk doctor / and this proved / he co^firmid his saing (of the nature and
substance) further: for the similitude of theodorete is this / quod he. As the
tokins of christ's body and blood affter the inuocacion of the prist do change
their namys and yet continewe the same substance / So the body of christ affter
his asce^syon / changed his name and was called immortal / yet had / it his
former fasshon / figure and cyrcumscripcyon / and to speak at one word / the
same substance off his body. Therefore / said master cheyny / yff in the former
part of the similitude / you deny the same substance to continue / than in the
latter part of the similitude which agreth with it / I will deny the body of
christ / affter his ascensyon to have the former nature and substance: but that
were a great herisy / therefore it is also a great herisy to take a way the
substance of bread and wine affter the sanctificacyon. Than was master watson
enforcyd to say that the substance of the body in the former part of the
similitude brought in by him / did signifye quantite and other accidencys of
the sacramental tokens which be seen / and not the very substance of the same.
And therefore theodoret says / (que videntur.) et ce, that is those things which
be seen for according to philosophy / the accidents of thingys be seen / and
not the substances. M. cheny appealed to the lords.
Than master cheyny appealed to the honorable menn and desiered that they should
give no credyte unto them in so saing / for yff they should so thi^ck / as they
would teach / affter their lordshyppys had ridden xl. mylys on horseback / as
their besynes do sometime require / they should not be able to say at night
that they saw their horses all the day but only the color of their horsys /
and by his reason christ must goo to stole and learn of Aristotle to speak.
For when he saw nathanaell under the figg tree yff Aristotle had stand by / he
would have said / no christ / thou saw not him but the color of him / Affter
this / watson said / what yff it were granted that theodorete was on their side
/ where as they had one of that opinyon / there were an hundredth on the other
side. morga^ is called for to help at a pinch.
Than the prolocutor called for master morgan to help. And he said that
Theodorete did not more than he might laufullly do. For first he granted the
truth / and than / for fear of such as were not fully instructed in the faith
/ he spoke (enigmaticos) that is covertly and in a misteri / And this was
lawful for him to do. For first he granted the truth and called them the body
of christ and the blood off christ / than affterward he seemed to give somewhat
to the senses and to reason. but that theodoret was of the same mi^d that they
were of / the wordis following quoth he / do declare. For that which follows
is a cause off that which went before / and therefore he says (The immortalyte
and ce. morga^ is taken with falls alleging of the text
) whereby it does appear that he meant the dyuyne nature and not the humane.
Than was morgan taken with misalleagyng of the text. For the book had not this
word (for) for the greek word did rather signifye (truly /) and not / (for /)
so that it might manifestly appear that it was the beginning of a new matter
and not a sentence rendering a cause of that he had said be sore. Than was it
said by watson again / suppose that theodorete be with you / which is one that
we never hard off printed / but iij. or iiij. yearis agoo. Yet he is but one /
And what is one against the hole consent of the church. Affter this master
cheyny inferrid / that not only theodorete was of that mind / that the
substance of bread and wine do remain / but diverse other also and specially
Ireneus / who making mencyon of this sacrament / says thus when the cupp which
is mingled with wine / and the bread that is made / do receive the word of
god / it is made the thankis gyuing of the body and blood of christ / by the
which the substance of our flessh is norisshed and does co^syst. Yff the
thankis giving do norissh our body / than there is some substance besides
christ's body. To the which reason / both watson and morgan answered / that (ex
quibus /) by the which / in the sentence of Ireneus were referred to the next
antecedent / that is to the body and blood of christ / and not to the wine /
which is in the cupp and the breed that is made. master cheiny replied that it
was not the body of christ / which norisshed our bodies. And let it be that
christ's flessh norissh to immortalite yet it does not answer that argument /
although it be true / no more tha^ that answer which was made to my
allegacyon out of. s. Paull / The bread which we break et ce. with certain
other like / whereu^to you answered that bread was not taken there in his
proper significacyon / but for that that it had been: No More tha^ the rodd of
Aaron which was taken for the serpent / because it had been a serpent. Affter
this master cheny brought in hisichius and used the same reason that he did of
the custom of burning of Symbolys / and he axed the^ what was burnt. Master
watson said we must not inquyre nor axe / but yff there were any fawte / impute
it to christ. Harpsfeld called in to help watson
Than said master cheiny / where of came those asshys / not of a substance? or
can any substance rise of accydence? Than was master harpysfeld called led in /
to see what he could say in the matter. who told a fair tale of the
omnipotency of god / and of the imbecillitye and weakness of ma^s reason / not
able to atteyne to godly things. And he said it was convenient that what so
ever we saw / felt / ortasted / not to trust our sensys / And he told a tale
out of s. here is goodly gear / as if it wereowt of the legend of lies.
cypryane how a woman saw the sacrament burning in her cofer / and that which

that was that burnt he could not tell. But master cheyny contynewed still and
forced the^ with this question / what it was that was burnt? It was either /
said he / the substance of bread or else the substance of the body of christ /
which were to much absurdy te to grant. At length they abswered that it was a
miracle: weston would know whether they were suficientli answered wha^ he nor
his had not answered and argument.

D. weston axed of the company there whether those men were sufficiently answered
or not certain prystes cried yea / but they were not hard at all / for the great
multitude which cried No / No: which cry was hard and noysed almost to the
end of powlys. Whereat D. Weston being much moved / answered bitterly that he
axed not the judgment of the rude multitude and unlearned people / but of the^
which were of the hows. Tha^ ared he of master haddo^ and his felows whether
they would answer them other iij. days. Haddon / cheiny and elmer said no. But
the archdeacon of winchester stood up and said that they should not say but they
should be answered / and though all other did refuse to answer / yet he wolt not
but offered to answer them all / one affter a another: mark mesto^s impudency.
with whose profer the prolocutor was not contentid / but rayled on him and said
that he should goo to bedlem. To whom the archdeacon soberly made this answer:
that he was more worthy to be sent thither who used him selff so ragingly in
that disputacyon with out any indifferent-equalite. a strong argument of
weston, where he is not able to answer he would out fa-
Than rose D. Weston up and said / There has all the company subscrybed to our
article / saving only these menn / which you see What their reasons are / you
have hard. We have answered them iij. Days / op on promise (as it pleased him
to descant / with out truth / for no such promise was made) that they should
answer us again / as long: As the order of disputacyon does require: and yff
they be able to defend their doctrine / let them so do. Tha^ master elmer
stood up and proved how a vain a man weston was: for he affyrmed that they
never promised to dispute / but only to open and testify to the world their
conscyences: for when they were required to subscribe they refused / and said
they would show good reasons which mouyd their consciences that they could not
with their consciences subscribe / as they had partly allredy done and were
able to do more sufficiently. Therefore / quoth he / it has been ill called a
disputacyon / and they worthy to be blamet that were the auctors of that name.
For we meant not to dispute / nor now mean not to answer / before our
argume^tis / quoth he / which we have to propownd / be soluted according as it
was appointed. For by answeryng we should but incomber our seluys and profit
nothing / sins the matter is allredy decreyd up on and determined / what so
ever we shall prove or dispute to the contrary.

On monday following being the xxx. of october / weston
the prolocutor demanded of John fyllpot archdecon of winchester whether he
would answer in the questions before propowned / to their obieccyons or no? To
whom he made this answer that he would willingly so do / yff according to their
former determinacyon / they would first answer sufficiently to some of his
argumentie as they had promised to do: whereoff he had a dosen and not halff
of the first yet decyded: And yff they would answer fully and sufficiently but
to one of his argumentis / he promised that he would answer all the obyeccyons
that they should bring. Than the prolocutor bad him propownd his argument and it
should be resolutely answered / by one of them / whereunto master morgan was
appointed. fylpot and morgan.
Up on wede^sday last / quoth he / I was enforced to silence before I had
beaten out halff of mine argument / the sum where of was this / as was
gathered by the just context of the scripture / that the humane body of christ
was ascended into heaven and placyd on the right hand of god the father /
wherefor it cold not be situate up on earth in the sacrament of the altar
invisible affter the Imaginacyon of man. The argument was denied by morgane.
For the proof whereoff / fyllpot said that this was it that he had to confirm
his first argument / yff he might have been fufferid the other day: as thus.
One self and same nature / quod he / receiuith not in it selff any thing that
is contrary to yt self / but the body of christ is an humane nature distinct
from the deitye / and is a proper nature of yt selff / ergo / it can not
receive any thing that is contrary to that nature and that varieth from it
self but bodyly to be present and bodyly to be absent / to be one earth and to
be in heauyn and all at one present time / be things contrary to the nature of
an humane body / ergo it can not be said of the humane body of christ / that
the selff same body is both in heaven and also in earth at one instant / either
visybly or inuisibly. Morgan denied the mayor / that is the first part of the
argument. The which fylpot vowched out of vigilius an awneyent writer. here is
a new evasion inue^te^d by morga^ who dares not plainly deny vigilius
auctoritye / but under a color.
But morgan cauilled / that it was no scripture and bad him prove the same out
of scripture. Filpot said he could also so do / and right well diduce the
same out of. s. Paul / who says that christ is like unto us in all points /
except sin / and therefore / like as one of our bodies can not receive in it
selff any thing contrary to the nature of a body as to be in paulis church and
at westminster at one instant or to be at london visibly / and at lyncoln
inuisibly at one time. for that is so contrary to the nature of a body and of
all creaturys that as dydimus and basilius do affirm / that an inuisyble
creature / as an angel / ca^ not be at one time in diverse placis: where for he
concluded / that the body of christ might not be in moo places than in one /
which is in heauin and so consequently / not to be contained in the sacrament
of the altar. To this the prolocutor took up on him to answer / saing that it
was not true that christ was like unto us in all points / as fylpot took yt /
except synn: weston. answers / wisely / I warant you / and pythily
For that christ was not conceived by the sede of man as we be. To the which
fylpot replied that christ's concepcyon was prophesied before by the angel /
to be supernatural / but after he had received our nature / by the operacion
of the holy ghost in the virgins womb / he became affterwardes in all points
like unto us except synn. morga-
Than morgan inferred that this saing of paul did not plainly prove his
purpose. Well quoth fyllpot / I perceive you do answer but by cauillacion: Yet
am I not destitute of other scriptures to confirm my first argument /
allthough you refuse the probacion of so awncient and catholyke a doctor as
vigilius is. S. Peter in the sermon that he made in the third of the acts /
making mention of christ / says these words / whom heaven must receive /
until the consummacion of all things / et ce. Which words are spoken of his
humanity. No wyff heaven must hold christ / than can he not be here on earth
in the sacrament as is pretended Than morga^ / laughing at this and giving no
direct answer a tall / harpisfeld stood up which is one of the bishop of
londons chaplins and took up on him to answer to the saing of. s. Peter / and
demandid of filpot whether he would necescitate / that is / of necessitye force
/ christ to any place or no? Fylpot said that he would no notherwise force
christ of necessity to any place / than he is taught by the words of the holy
ghost / which sownd thus that christ's humane body must abide in heaven until
the day of judgment / as I rehearsed out of the chapter before mentioned.
harpsfeld.
Why / quoth harpisfeld / do you not know that christ is god omnipotent? Yes
/ said fylpot / I know that right well neither dowt I any thing at all of his
omnipotency / but of christ's omnipotency what he may do is not our questyon /
but rather what he does I know he may make a stone in the wall / a man / yff
he list / and also that he may make moo worlds / but does he therefore so?

It were no good consequent so to conclude / he may do this or that / therefore
he does it. We must believe so much of his omnipote^cy / as he by his word has
declared and taught us: but by his word he has taught us that the heavens must
receive his body until the day of dome: therefore we ought so to bileue. Why /
quoth the prolocutor / than you will put christ in prison in heauin To the
which fylpot a^swered do you reken heaven to be a prison? weston.
god grant us all to come to that prison. Affter this harpisfeld inferred that
this word (oportet) in. the prolocutor and fylpor.
s. peter which did signify in Inglissh / (must /) did not import so much as I
would infer of necessitye. as by other placis of scripture it may appear /
where (oportet) is as well as there as in the first to timothy where paul says
/ (oportet episcopum esse vnius vxoris virum /) a bishop must be the husband
of one wife / here quoth he / (oportet /) must. does not import such a
necescytie but that he that never was married may be a bishop. To this fylpot
said again that the placis were not like which he went about to compare. which
thing ought specially to be observed in conferring of wordis / or scriptures to
gether. For that in the place by him alleged. s. paull does declare of what
qualitye a bishop ought to be. but in the other. s. peter teaches us the
place where christ must necessarily be until the end of the world / which we
ought to bileue to be true. And this comparyson of this word (oportet /) does
no more answer mine argument than yff I would say of you / now being here
(oportet te hic esse) you must nedis be here (which imports such necessitye
for the time / that you can no notherwyse be but here) and yet you would goo
about in wordis to avoid this necessitye with a another (oportet) or a another /
(must /) in a another sentence as this / (oportet te esse viru^ bonum) you must
be a good man. where (oportet) does not in very deed conclude any such
necessity but that you may be an ill man. Thus you may see that your answer is
not sufficyent / and as it were no answer to my argument. Than the prolocutor
brought in a another (oportet) to help this matter yff it might be sayng / what
say you to this (oportet hereses esse /) must herisyes nedis be therefore bicaus
of this word (oportet?) no truly / quoth fylpot / it can not other wise be /
yff you will add that which follows immediately up on those wordis of paul /
that is (vt qui electi su^t manifestentur) that is / that such as be the elect
of god may be manifested and known. Why / quoth the prolocutor / the time has
been that no heresies were. I know no such time / quoth fillpott / for syns
the time of Abell and Cayn herisies have been and than begann they. Tha^ said
the prolocutor / will you now answer morgan an argument s^^? I will / quoth
fyllpott / yff I may first be answered of mine argument any thing according to
truth and to lerning What / quoth the prolocutor / you will never be answered.
How I am answered / quoth fyllpott / let all men that are here present judge:
and specially such as be learned / and with what cauillacyons you have dalyed
with me. First to the awncyent auctoritye of vigilius you have answered nothing
at all / but only denieng it to be scripture that he says. Secondarily tot he
saing of s. Peter in the actis ye have answered thus / demanding of me /
whether I would keep christ in prison or no. Let all me^ now judge yff this be a
sufficient answer or no. Than stood morgan up again / and axed filpott whether
he would be ruled by the universal church or no? Morgan.
Yes / quoth he / yff it be the true catholic church. And fith you speak so
much of the church I would feign that you would declare what the church is. The
church.
The church / quoth morhan / is diffused and dispersed through out the hole
world. That is a diffuse diffinicion / quoth fyllpot / for I am yet as uncertain
as I was before what you mean by the church. But I knowledge no church but that
which is grownded and fownded on gods word as S. Paull says / up on the
fowndacyon of the prophetis and apostles / and on on the scripturys off god.
What / quoth moreman / was the scripture before the church? Yea quoth fylpot /
Morema^ / and fylpot.
But I will prove Nay / quoth moreman / and I will begin at christis time.
The church of christ was before any scripture writton. For Mathewe was the
first that wrote the gospel about a dosen yearys affter christ ergo the church
was before the scripture. To whom filpot answeryng / denied his argument. Which
when morema^ cowld not prove / filpot showed that his argument was (elechus) or
a fallace / that is a deceyuable argument. For he took the scripture only to be
that which is wrytton by men in letters / where as in very deed all prophecy
vtteryd by the spirit of god / was cownted to be scripture before it was
wrytton in paper and Inck. For that it was wrytto^ in the hartis and graven in
the mindis yea and inspyred in the mowthys of good men and off christis
apostles by the spirit of christ: As the salutacion of the Angel was the
scripture of christ and the word of god before it was wryton. At that moreman
cried / fie / fie: wondering that the scripture of god should be cownted
scripture before it was writton / and affirmed that he had no knowledge that so
said. To who^ fillpot answerid that concerning knowledge in this behalff / for
the trial of the truth about the questions in controversy / he would wyssh him
selff no worse matched than with moreman. At the which saing / the prolocutor
was greuosly offended / saing that it was arrogantly spoken of him / that would
compare with such a worshipful learned man as morema^ was / being him selff a
man unlearned / yea a mad man meter to be sent to bedlem than to be a mong such
a sort of lernyd and grave men as there were / and a man that never would be
answered / and that trobled the whole hows: And therefore he did command him
that he should come no more in to the hows demanding of the hows whether they
would agree thereupon or no. To whom a great number answered Yea. Than said
fylpot again that he might thinck him selff happy that was out of that
company. Affter this morgan rose up and rownded the prolocutor in the ear. And
than again the prolocutor spoke to fylpott and said / lest you should slander
the house and say that we will not suffer you to declare your mind we are
content / you shall come in to the hows as you have done before / so that you
be apparelyd with a long gown and a typpet as we be / and that you shall not
speak but when I command you. Than quoth fylpot / I had rather be absent
altogether. And thus they ended.
