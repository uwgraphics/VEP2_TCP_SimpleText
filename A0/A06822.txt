TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE MY SINGVLAR AND BEST Lord, the Earl of Nottingham,
Lord high Admiral of England.
MY duty to your Lordship humbly remembered. Although the service which I
confess I do owe unto your Lordship in a manner from my childhood for many
favors, does so much oblige me, as I cannot think how ever it may fall in my
power to express it: yet cannot I but acknowledge that those favors of yours,
whereby any public trust or service has been committed to me, do sit nearest
my heart, and as often as I do think of them, do call me to a stricter
account then any others, which do only touch me in a private quality: for
that in the one, I am only obliged to acquit my honesty toward your love:
but in the others I am bound in a sort to make good your judgment, and to
justify the choice you have made of me, as a servant of the State, for whom
your self are accountable to her from whom all power in our State is derived.
The sense which hereof I have in the inwardest retraite of my soul, is the
cause I have thought my duty both to you, and to the State not a little
interessed, in a report very vulgar in many men's mouths in the City, and by
this time perhaps spread over the Realm. And confirmed by a Pamphlet printed,
containing a narration of the late service done upon the Galleys: wherein no
mention being made, neither of my self, nor of any of her Majesty's Ships,
nor of our nation, we are all secretly touched with some note, either of
negligence of the things committed to us, (I specially) or of unskillfulness, or
of want of courage: from the stains of all which it imports me to clear my
self, not only for mine own sake, and our nations; but in some sort for your
Lordship, who through my errors cannot but be wounded, for the ill choice made
of me, for so great a charge: I have therefore (though against my nature, which
delights not to talk of my self) been forced for your Lordship, and all
other men's satisfaction, to express in a few lines, a true report of all that
was done in that service: which as it is free from affectation of glory to my
self, or of imputation to others; so do I upon all the duty I owe, both to
your Lordship, and to my own reputation, undertake to make good in every point
thereof. Beseeching your Lordship notwithstanding, not to repose your self
only upon mine own assertions: but by diligent inquisition (which is not hard
for your Lordship to make, having so much power over the whole company that
served with me) thoroughly to inform your self of as much as may suffice to
satisfy your judgment: which if thereby you shall find confirmed so much as
not to repent you of the trust by your favor committed unto me, it is the
utmost of my desire, weighing otherwise little what the vulgar conceits of such
as either cannot, or will not think aright, shall esteem of me: if by this
true report of my service they will not be satisfied. For it is those that can
judge, whom I desire most to content, and specially your Lordship, to whom I
do with as much truth and synceritie dedicate all other services which I may
be able to do, as I have used in setting down this: which I beseech you to
accept as a small testimony thereof.

Your Lordships in all devotion: ROBERT MANSEL.

A TRVE REPORT OF THE SERVICE DONE UPON CERTAIN GALLEYS passing thorough the
Narrow Seas.
ON the three and twenty day of September being in the Hope, and having in my
company, the Advantage only of the Queens Ships, which Captain Jones
commanded, and two other Dutch men of war: I rid more then half Channel
over, toward the coast of France, upon a Northwest and Southest line: my self
being nearest that coast, Captain Jones next unto me, and the Dutch men of
war a Sea-boord, and to the westward of him. The small force at yt time
present and with me remaining, thus disposed for the intercepting of the
Galleys, having dismissed the Dutch men of war, that served under me, upon
their own entreaty to reuictual and trim: and having employed the rest of
the Queens ships upon especial services, I descried from my top mast heads,
six low sails, which some made for Galleys; others affirmed them to be small
barks that had strooken their top-sailes, being bound from Deep toward the
Downs. To which opinion (though I inclined most) yet caused I the Master to
way and to stand with them, that I might learn some news of the Galleys,
which by your Lordships advertisement sent me, I knew had either past me that
night, or were near at hand: unless the Sea had swallowed them up in the
storms, which had raged three days before. Having set my self under sail,
the weather waxt thick, which caused me to lascke some two points from the
wind, toward the English coast, least the continuance of that dark weather
might give them power to run out a head of me. About eleven of the clock the
weather cleared, when I discovered them plainly to be the Spanish Galleys so
long time expected; at which time with the rest, I plied to receive them by
crossing their forefoote, as they stood along the Channel: which they
endeavored, till they perceived that by the continuance of that course, they
could not escape the power of my Ordinance. All this time these two Fliboates
were betwixt them and me: and as the Slaves report that swam a shore at Dover,
they determined with three Galleys to have boorded each of those Ships, and
would have executed that resolution, but for the fear of her Majesty's great
Galion (as the termed the Hope) whose force that they shunned in that kind
(considering the disadvantage that twice six of the best Galleys that ever I
saw, has by fighting against one Ship of her force) I do as much commend, as
otherwise I do detest their shameful working in that full of cowardlines and
weakness, they rowed back to the westward, and spent the day by running away:
in hope that the darkness of the night would give them liberty sufficient to
shun the only Ship they feared, or that was in deed in the Sea at that
time, to give them cause of fear, I mean betwixt them and Dunkerke or
Newport. This error only of theirs bred their confusion, as you may perceive
by the sequel. For they no sooner began that course of rowing back again;
but I instantly made signs for Captain Jones in the Advantage of the Queens,
to come unto me: whom I presently directed to repair to Callis road; and
thence to send the al-arme unto the States army prepared before Sluice: and to
advise such men of war as kept on the coast of Flanders, upon any other
occasion, to stand off to the Sea, to meet with the Galleys in the night,
which should be chased by me with my lights in my Topmast heads, and a
continual discharging of my Ordinance. Captain Jones having shapte his course
according to my directions: I gave order for hoysing and trimming of my Sails
by the wind, to keep sight of the Galleys: the two Fliboates being still a
weather of me, did the like. Which chase we held till sun setting, observing
this course following all the day. They being a weather of me, kept their
continual boords, that the Galleys were always betwixt them. And my self
being to Leeward, made such short turns, as I kept all the afternoon in a
manner, even in the very eye of their course, betwixt them and the place of
their desseigne: ever discharging my best Ordinance to warn the Answer of her
Majesty's, that rid by my directions at the Downs, upon important service as
your Lordship knows: and the Flemmings that were there, having left the Sea
upon unknown grounds to me (yet sent from Portsmouth, by the most provident
direction of her sacred Majesty, to awaite the coming of the Galleys, upon
aduertisements that her Highness received of their being put to Sea) to set
sail, who else had received no understanding of the Galleys: neither came they
within shot of them, till after night, howsoever the reputation of the service
is wholly challenged by them.

Having given your Lordship an account how this day was thus spent by me, from
eight of the clock until the evening, and with these only helps: I beseech
your Lordship to be pleased to understand, that with the setting of the Sun,
I could both discern the Ships last mentioned under sail at the Downs, and
the Galleys to have set their sails: directing their course close aboard our
shore, each of them being out of sight of the other, and my Dutch consorts by
this time to have been left by the Galleys to a stern chase. When I perceived
them to hold that course, which would bring them within shot of the Answer,
and the rest that were in the Downs: I held a clean contrary course from
them, toward the coast of France, to confirm the secure passage they thought
to find on our coast, which I continued, until the report of their battery
gave me assurance of the Galleys being engaged unto tham.

How the battery began, who began it, how it was continued, how ended, and to
whom the reputation of the service is due, I leave to be considered by your
Lordship, by the perusal of the true discourse following.

The Answer of the Queens, which Captain Bredgate commanded, as she rid more
Southerly at the Downs then the Flemmings, so came she first to the Galleys,
and bestowed 28. pieces of Ordinance on them before the Flemmings came in, who
at length seconded him with very many shot. During this battery of ours upon
the Galleys, (which I so term, because they never exchanged one shot) at the
very first report of the Answers Ordinance, I directed the Master of my ship to
bear up with the South end of the Goodwin, with which directions I delivered
my reasons publicly, as I stood on the poope of my ship, viz. That if I stood
directly in to them, the Galleys, before I could recover the place, would
either be driven a shore or sunk, and so would there prove no need of my
force; or else by their nimble sailing they would escape the ships, of whom
(once getting a head) they could receive no impediment: for there was no one
ship but the Advantage in the sea that could hinder them to recover any port
in Flanders or the East Countries (Sluice only excepted) unless I stayed them
at that sand head.

Having recovered as near that place as I desired, I stayed at least a quarter
of an hour, before I could either see Gallie, hear or see any of those Ships,
their lights, or report of their Ordinance, which made me and all my company
hold opinion that they had outsailed the Answer and the rest of the Flemmings,
and shunned sight of me by going a seaboord of my ship: which I so verily
believed, as I once directly determined to sail for Sluice, with hope only
that the preparation which I knew the States had there, would be able to
prevent their entrance into that place.

Whilst I remained thus doubtful, or rather hopeless to hinder their
recovery of Dunkerke or Newport, in case they had been a seaboord of me, some
of my company descried a single Gallie plying from the shore to get a head of
my ship. When she approached within Caliuer shot, I discharged above thirty
pieces of Ordinance of my lower and upper tire at her alone, my self with many
other in my ship saw when her maineyard was shot asunder, heard the report of
many shot that hit her hull, heard many their most pitiful outcries: which
when I perceived to continue, and in steed of making way from me, to near me
what she could; I forbear shooting, and commanded one that spoke the Portugal
language, to tell them that I was contented to receive them into mercy: which
I would accordingly have performed, had not the other five Galleys offered to
stand out a head of me at that very instant, and thereby would have left me as
they had done both the first two Dutch ships, and afterward the Answer with
the rest of the Flemmings, had I omitted any small time of executing the
advantage I had of their being on my broad side, which as appears was so
effectually employed (howsoever the night wherein this service was performed,
might hinder the particular mention of their hurts) as none can deny but that
God pleased thereby only to work their confusion. For since that time none
has said or can speak of any one shot made toward them: yet four of them
are sunk and wracked, the fifth past doing the enemy service: and the sixth
they are forced to new build at Dunkerke, where (if I be not much deceived)
she will prove more chargeable then profitable, if the fault rest not in our
selves.

The disagreement between the Dutch Captains themselves touching the stemming
and sinking of the Galleys (whereof one challenged before your Lordship, and in
many other public places, to have stemmed and sunk two himself) and the
printed Pamphlet containing the stemming and sinking of three Galleys, gives
the reputation thereof to three several Captains, amongst whom no mention is
made of the first: and whereas there are but two in all sunk; I leave to be
reconciled amongst themselves, and to your Lordship, whether that the same of
right appertains not to her Majesty's Ship the Hope, in respect of the
allegations before mentioned, every particular whereof being to be proved by
the oaths of my whole Company, and maintained with the hazard of my life with
that which follows.

1 As the shooting of the single Galleys mainyard asunder, my bestowing above
thirty pieces of Ordinance upon that one Gallie, within less then Caliuer
shot.

2 That they in the Galley made many lamentable outcries for my receiving them
unto mercy.

3 That I would accordingly have received them, but for giving them over to
encounter with the other five Galleys, which else had left me to a stern chase.

To these reasons I add the assertions of the Viceadmirall himself, who told
me (whatsoever he spoke in other places) that one of the Galleys, which he
stemmed, had her maineyard shot asunder before his coming aboard her: by whom
soever she was then stemmed, your Lordship may judge, who ruined her,
considering she made no resistance, by his own report, but by crying to him
for mercy.

Touching the other Gallie stemmed and sunk, I have already proved how she
(as all the rest) had got a head the Answer of the Queens not named, and the
rest of the Statesmen of war with her, who challenge the whole credit of
this service: They (as all other Seamen) cannot deny, but that the Galleys
will outsaile all Ships, in such a loome gale of wind and smooth sea, as we
had that night.

The Galleys being then quicker of sail then they, how could they by any
means possible fetch them up, but by some impediment? Impediment they received
none, but by my Ordinance: which amounted to fifty great shot at those five
which came last from the shore, when all the ships were above a mile a stern.

Some notwithstanding out of their detracting dispositions may perchance say,
that the two which were wrecked at Newport would have perished by storm,
though they had not been battered. Whereto though I have sufficiently answered,
first in showing that they might have recovered any of the places thereabouts
before 8. of the clock that night but for me; and then the second time before
the morning, had they not been encountered by me alone, at the South-sand head:
yet for further proof that they miscarried by our battery only, I say that if
one of the Galleys which received least damage by our Ordinance did outliue
Fridaies storm, continuing till Saturday noone, being driven among the Islands
of Zealand to recover Callis, then surely those two (unless they had bin
exceedingly torn) would have made shift to have recovered the Ports of
Newport, Graueling or Dunkerke: especially since from the place where I battered
them, they might have bin at the remotest of those places about four hours
before any storm began. But such seemed their haste to save their lives, as
their thought ran of a shore, and not of a harbor.

Now that I have delivered unto your Lordship the whole and true discourse of
this business, I shall forbear to trouble your patience with any further
relation of that night and next days spending my time (though the same in
their chase had like to have cost her Majesty her Ship, and the lives of as
many as were in her) and conclude with admiration of their not holding her
Majesty's ships, nor I (her unworthiest servant) and then and yet by her
Highness grace and your Lordships favor, Admiral of the forces in that place,
are not once mentioned: especially since the six Galleys might safely have
arrived before seven of the clock that night at any of the Ports of Flaunders
to the Westward of Ostend. And that the Dutch ships had not come from an
anchor in the Downs, but for the signs they received from me. Then that the
force of her Majesty's Ship, wherein I was, enforced them to keep close
aboard the English shore, whereby those Ships in the Downs had power given
them to come to fight, which fight was begun by the Answer of the Queens.

And lastly, since the Galleys escaped their battery, and had gotten a head
those Ships, above a mile at least, and never received any impediment after,
but only by me, who lingered them (as you have heard) until the coming up of
those Ships that challenge to stem them: which being granted, I cannot see
how any other credit can rightly be given them (for that stem I mean) then
to a lackey for pillaging of that dead body which his master had slain.

ALthough this be a very true report of that which was done in this service,
and be a thing very plausible to all that are well affected to ye good success
of her Majesty's affairs: yet should it not have moved me much who were
esteemed to have been the chief actor in so good a work; or to whom any
augmentation of credit might grow thereby, were it not that I have found some,
who (I deny not) have had their part in that service, have been so far
transported with the opinion of their own desert therein, as they have not let
in setting forth their own commendation, to cast a stain upon other men's,
who had a greater part in the work then themselves, as may appear by the
report above recited. Which notwithstanding should the less trouble me, if the
touch thereof did reach only to my self as a private gentleman: but seeing the
imputation, as it may be gathered in a Pamphlet printed, containing a report of
that service, wherein no mention at al is made either of me, or of any other
her Majesty's servants or Ships, or of any of our nation, does derogate not
only from my self, but in some sort from the diligence and vigilancie of al
public ministers of her Majesty's Navy: it behooved me to have so much sense
of mine and their reputations, as by a true report of the thing (as indeed it
was done) to redeem the slander that in some men's conceits (whose ears are
quick enough to receive ill impressions of public officers) might be easily
laid upon us. For which only cause is this report published. For how little
respect I had to affect reputation to my self by publishing any report of that
which had passed in this service, may appear by this one circumstance: that as
soon as I had presented my self to your Lordship, and Master Secretary at the
Court at Oatelands, and bin by your Honors presented to her Majesty, and made
report of that which had passed: my first suite was, to be licensed to go into
the country (as your Honor can well witness) whither immediately I repaired
attending my own business, and from thence returned but very lately, without
any thought or purpose of declaiming my own actions, or of any other thing,
more then of returning to my charge, until coming to the City I found every
man's mouth full of an injurious report of that service, and likewise a Pamphlet
printed by the procurement of some who had had to do in that service, which did
confirm the misconceit thereof. Wherefore I have been constrained to do that,
which otherwise (as I have said) is not agreeable to my nature, that is, to
speak of my self. But I shall be herein the more to be excused, because the
matter does concern me not only as a private person, but as a public servant
of the State: toward which it becomes me to make clear all actions
wherewith I am put in trust. For which respect I must also add this much more;
that if any man will take exception to any point of that which I have here
above upon so good consideration set down: I would have him understand that I
have not lightly put forth this report, as a blast to fill men's ears: but so
advisedly, that at all times I will be ready to maintain and justify the
truth thereof, in such sort as becomes a Gentleman professing Arms; and
bearing the charge, which by her Majesty's favor I do, to justify any thing,
which he takes upon the hazard of his reputation to report. And in assurance
thereof I have to this report set my hand, and published it in my name.

ROBERT MANSEL.
