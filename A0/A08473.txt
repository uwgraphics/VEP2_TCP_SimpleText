THE COPY OF A LETter, written by the general States, unto the particular
united Provinces in the Netherlands.
WE send your Honors herewith, a copy of the sentence, which the Judges
thereunto appointed, pronounced against the prisoners (long deliberated upon by
us) which on the 13 of this present month, was published, and execution done
upon the person of John van Olden Barnevelt, late Counselor or Advocate of
Holland and VVest-Freseland: The said Judges withal sent us certain
ouertures, of diverse other points, that were made known unto them, and are not
mentioned in the aforesaid sentence, which according to the informations, and
consequences thereof, gave great suspicion that he had intelligence with the
enemy, and wholly bended his actions thereunto, seeking nevertheless not to
give nor minister any offense to the other side, but to the contrary made show
to favor the same; but for that the substance of the confessions made upon
those points, were such, that no definitive sentence could have bin given upon
them, without further inquisition, and sharper examination, which by the said
Judges, was not thought convenient, in respect of his great age, and other
considerations, concerning the service of the Land, as also for that the
decision of them and other matters, could no longer be delayed, and that the
articles in the said sentence contained, are sufficient to condemn him; we
have omitted them, and thought it good and necessary hereby to certify you
thereof, beseeching God to have your Honors and us in his holy keeping: from
the Hage the 19. of May 1619. underwritten

John van Dorth vt. and a little lower, By the order of the States, C. AERSEN.

THE IVDGMENT GIVEN AND PRONOVNCED upon John van Olden Barneuelt, late Advocate
of HOLLAND and WEST-FRESELAND, together with his execution performed upon the
13 of May 1619. Stylo novo.
John van Olden Barnevelt sometime Advocate or Counselor of the Provinces of
Holland and West-Freesland, and at this present committed to prison,
Commissioners being by the general States ordained and appointed to examine
him, and to make report thereof unto the Judges by the said general States
ordained to sit upon the same, without rack or any torment confessed, (as to
the said Judges also it manifestly appeared)

1
That notwithstanding, it is not lawful for any man, to break or violate the
unity, and fundamental laws, whereupon the government of the united
Netherlands is grounded, and whereby the said Countries (by Gods special
blessing, notwithstanding all the forces, practices and devices of their
enemies and evil willers) has bin hitherto preserved and defended: he the
said prisoner had taken upon him, to trouble the state of the Religion, and
thereby to bring the Church of God into great trouble and extremity. To that
end had maintained and put in practice, most exorbitant and pernicious maxims
against the state of the Land, and among them, with great boldness, of himself
and by his accomplices inserted, that some of the Provinces of the said united
Netherlands, had power and authority of themselves, to order and dispose of
religion at their wills and pleasures, and that the rest of the Provinces had
nothing to do therewith.

2
That without commission or authority, he had in his own house made certain
protestations in the name of the Provinces of Holland, Vtrecht, and Ouerissell,
whereby they together, by manner of complot (against all order used in the
assemblies of the general States) protested, that the Deputies of the
Provinces which were appointed for the furthering of the National Synod,
would be the authors and causers of great troubles and inconveniences.

3
That he contemning the good and wholesome counsels of diverse Princes, Lords,
and noble Personages both in and without the land, as much as in him lay, had
sought to withstand and hinder the remedies procured for the ceasing of
controversy in Religion.

4
That to further and maintain his designs aforesaid, he had abused certain
of the mightiest Potentates with unseemly and sinister practices, and to that
end by his own authority instructed, and caused to be instructed, the
Ambassadors for the States with untrue propositions.

5
That he also had taken upon him to write to the States Ambassador resident in
Great Britannie, that if any thing should be written by the said King
concerning the state of Religion, that it should be sent to the States of
Holland; and that he should procure the staying thereof, until he had sent the
copy unto him to consider of it, and to stay his answer thereupon, before he
sent the same, and that the letters should be directed unto him, that he might
deliver them, for the good and service of the land (assuming to himself all
the authority and government thereof.)

6
That he took upon him, in the name of the States of Holland and
West-Friesland, to write to the King of France, that those States General that
proclaimed a national Synod, usurped the names of the General States, wishing
his Majesty not to send any of his subjects unto the said Synod, but rather to
aid and assist those of Holland against the factions of the States.

7.
That by indirect means he had sought for and procured letters from the King
of England, which he himself had first drawn and corrected, and then sent
them over to the Ambassador, tending to the furthering of his own designs,
which he himself delivered to the general States, but made them not
acquainted in what manner he had procured them, writing to the said Ambassador,
that he should not by any means make the Ambassadors at that time in England
for the general States, acquainted therewith.

8.
That for the better furtherance of his designs and pretenses, by the said
Ambassadors means he sought to procure the like letters again from the King
of England, which when he could not get, he did not stick to presume to tax
the said King, with being the cause of the troubles that were then risen in the
united Provinces.

9
That, to procure the more and greater trouble in religion, he had placed and
brought into the Churches diverse heretical Divines and Teachers, and in the
mannageing of the State had put in such men, as he thought to be fit
instruments for the effecting and furtherance of his faction.

10
That he likewise had brought to pass, that his said creatures and instruments
at diverse and several times, and sundry places, contrary to all good order of
government, had holden diverse conuenticles and secret assemblies, where, by him
and his accomplices it was determined how they might proceed in their bad
pretense: and to the end the same might be authorized under the names of the
States of Holland and West-Freisland, he had so plotted, that by multitude of
voices (contrary to the will and desire of some of the chiefest members of
Holland) they might resolve upon that which they desired and intended: and yet
he himself confesses, that such private assemblies are not to be permitted in
a well-gouerned Commonwealth.

11
That he did not seek to hinder the rigorous commissions in some places sent
forth against the true professors of religion, whereby they were upon strict
penalties forbidden the exercise of the true religion, making them hateful in
all places both within and without the Land, by the names of strangers, and
Puritans, who there Flanderising, caused the subjects to contend with their
Governors. Notwithstanding that all the united Provinces together, by many and
sundry treaties, agreements, and resolutions, (whereof he himself, as one of
the States, had been the author and inuentor) had promised and bound
themselves one unto another, with body, life, and goods, to maintain, preserve
and uphold, the reformed evangelical religion, received and preached in every
place of those Countries, without any alteration thereof whatsoever. And that
for confirmation thereof, in Anno 1588. the oaths of all the Governors,
Generals, Captains, and soldiers, in one point specially mentioned the same,
which was that they should swear to be true and faithful to the general
States, who by the unity and faithful combination of promise, should uphold
and maintain the true reformed religion: and that in all the treaties and
compositions made with such towns as they either won, or that yielded
themselves to them, one special Article was, that they should yield to the
preaching of the aforesaid religion, which by all their adherents and allies
had been received, allowed of, and accepted.

12
That he esteeming all this not to be sufficient to effect his bad and
erroneous designs, sought by the means of his accomplices and adherents, to
perturbe and trouble the politic State, devising to invent and find the
means to reduce and bring the government thereof into disorder and confusion,
by means thereof the better to effect his mischievous pretense against the
security and prosperity of the same.

13
That to the same end, and for a foundation of his faction, under diverse
special pretenses, he had kindled the fire of dissension, and procured all
manner of distrusts between the Provinces, and making himself head of the
faction, had caused the Deputies of eight towns in Holland to hold diverse
secret assemblies, upon certain points by them agreed upon, to prevent the
rest of the towns, (and so by plurality of voices, having formerly complotted
together) in the assembly of the States of Holland, to bring them in, and to
make such resolutions thereupon as they had formerly determined. In which
private assemblies, the Deputies of the said eight towns, among other things,
first complotted and agreed upon diverse points, (which at several times were
by them debated) and concluded to bring to effect.

14
That he himself had therein inserted the sharp and severe resolution made
the 18. of August 1617. and against the wills and consents of diverse chief
members of the said assembly, caused the same to be ratified and confirmed. By
which resolution, the prohibitions of ordinary Justice made against their
pretenses, were declared and pronounced to be void and of none effect: and the
Magistrates of the towns, warranted, not to obey the same; and such as were
thereunto incited and consenting, authorized and allowed, of their own
authorities, for their defenses, to raise new companies of soldiers, and to
give them another oath (contrary to their oath of allegiance made to the
States General) by the which also all Officers, Justices, and those that were
by oath bound unto the particular Provinces of Holland and West-Freisland, were
sworn to maintain and further the said resolution: And further ordained, that
all Generals, Captains and soldiers of the ordinary companies, should
earnestly be charged and commanded, upon pain of losing of their places, to be
obedient to the States, their pay-masters, and the Magistrates of the towns
where they lay in garrison, notwithstanding any other prohibition or
commandment made to the contrary: whereby it followed, that diverse towns in
Holland (whereof some before that by his advice and counsel had begun to
take up soldiers) upon the same resolution (and his secret instigation that
they should look unto themselves and their securities) began to raise a great
number of soldiers, giving them a particular oath, as aforesaid, with special
charge to be obedient only to their commandments, against all men whatsoever,
and particularly against the generality, and his Excellency, in such cases,
wherein the said towns (so strengthening themselves with new soldiers) should
judge and understand the proceedings of the said generality and his
Excellency to tend unto the overthrow of their particular rights and
privileges.

15
That he by force of the said resolution, was a means to procure Commissioners
to be sent unto the Brill, who (without the knowledge of his Excellency being
Stateholder and Captain general) going thither, caused the ordinary garrisons
therein to take their oaths in manner aforesaid, and such as would not, were
threatened to be cashierd.

16
That he, within few days after the said resolution was made, went to Vtrecht,
and counseled some of the States there likewise, to raise new companies of
soldiers, contrary to the accustomed manner, and the common oath of the
generality and his Excellency, as Captain general, which they accordingly
raised, with a particular oath as aforesaid.

17
And when the General States, perceiving the said raising of soldiers to be
contrary to order and general custom, thought it fit to advertise them by
letter, to surcease from the same, that he was the author and cause, that the
said States of Vtrecht, took upon them by letters of the 5. of September 1617.
to excuse their said proceeding unto the General States, with vain and idle
pretenses, as that they were raised for the diuerting of popular commotion, and
yet he knew well, that the defense and preservation of the Provinces, towns,
and forts thereof, in general, by the union is referred to the disposition of
the generality of our united States in general: as also, that by the counsel
of State holden in Vtrecht anno 1610. it was likewise ordered, that whatsoever
belonged unto the security, peace and tranquillity of the town and
territories of Vtrecht in all respects should be referred to the said States
General. And that then a great garrison, belonging unto the said General
States, lay therein, which while the Armies were in Gelders and Cleaueland, was
not diminished: And besides, that by the said States, it was expressly ordered,
not to diminish the said garrison, but rather (if it were found necessary) to
increase the same.

18
That by the consent and knowledge of him, this instruction was inserted, and
the new soldiers were raised in Vtrecht, by the which, clean contrary to the
allegations and reasons in the letter aforesaid pretended, the said new
soldiers were bound, to serve both without and within the said Province,
against all and every person, both by water and by land, only under the
commandment or commission of the states of Vtrecht, and that they should not
only be ready at the commandment of the said States of Vtrecht, but also aid
and assist their good neighbors, friends, and allies.

19
And as in Vtrecht news was brought that his Excellency the Prince of Orange,
was to come into, and pass through the said town, a letter was by the said
States of Vtrecht (not without the said prisoners knowledge, as then being in
Vtrecht) sent unto the said Prince, to desire him, not to pass, nor come
through that town, with earnest advice to follow their counsel therein: he not
many days before, advertised the Secretary Ledenberch by private letters,
that it was fit and expedient for them, to keep a strong watch at their gates,
and also that both from above and beneath the river of Leck, they should be
advertised by the next towns, whether any soldiers were coming up or down
the said river, as also that the like was to be done upon the way that entered
into the town by Amersfort gate, desiring Ledenberch when he had read the
letters to burn them.

20
That he, by his instructions and counsels brought to pass, that by the
Deputies of the aforesaid eight towns, first in private meetings, in
unaccustomed places, and undue times, a certain procuration, or an act of
union, was drawn, which afterward also, was in some of the said towns by the
consent of the Common Council, and in some of them without their knowledge,
concluded and agreed upon, the 14. of May 1618. whereby they authorized their
Deputies, to consult, advise and resolve with the States and Deputies of the
other towns, upon a means of present resistance; as also, all together to
provide for, and to assure, all such promises of assistance, help, and
indemnities, as they should find to be necessary, needful and convenient.

21
That he caused a copy of the same act to be given unto Mons: Modesberghen by
Hoogherbet the pentionarie, and withal desired him to consider thereof, who
thereupon presently went to Vtrecht, and procured the like act there also to be
propounded, containing likewise an authority to be given unto their Deputies
touching the two former points of stricter union, and certain and present
means of resistance: and for that the town, together with some other of the
members of the States, would not grant nor consent thereunto, he desired the
Borghomaster van Pol (then being in the Hage) by his letters to move them
thereunto, or purposely to go thither about it: which to effect, the said
Borghomaster went personally thither; but the Magistrate of Vtrecht perceiving
whereunto the force of the said procuration or authority tended, would not
consent thereunto, but with an express limitation, that the Committies, should
not extend their authority to the furtherance or procuring of present or new
extremities, or to the making of new unity with any several Provinces, towns
or members thereof.

22
That when the States of Vtrecht, to ease themselves of the burden and charge
of maintayning the new companies of soldiers, and to let and withstand the
decreasing of their treasure and revenues, upon the 19. of June 1618. Stilo
vet: found it convenient to send a competent number of their Deputies to the
Hage, together with Monsieur Modesberghen and others, at the assembly of the
General States, to be holden there, and with his Excellency the Prince of
Orange, as Governor and Captain General of the Province of Vtrecht, to agree
upon the discharging of the said new soldiers, he counseled Ledenbergh (as
then one of the Deputies) in his own house (having intelligence of their said
commission by the said Ledenbergh) not to discover the same unto the Prince of
Orange, but to keep it secret, and to follow other advice by him given unto
the said Ledenbergh; not remembering that he himself confesses that he knew
full well, the great charge and burden of the Land, and the unfitness thereof
for the maintayning of new companies of soldiers, especially so great a number.

23
That he had intelligence given him, that the said Ledenbergh, together with
the pentionarie Hoogherbet, and Grotius, in the house of John Vtenbogaet did
consult upon the reasons, and motives, that should be observed with the
aforesaid Deputy of the States of Vtrecht, to divert, and dissuade them not to
put their commission in effect; as also, that the same deliberation holden, and
required by Ledenbergh, should be kept secret: whereupon it followed that the
said Hoogerbets and his accomplices, in the house of Daniel Tresel Clarke to the
general Sates, meeting together, with many very sharp and pernicious
speeches, and motions used by Grotius, dissuaded the Deputies of Vtrecht to
show their authority; whereof also the said prisoner was advertised, and
whereby also the said Deputies were compelled to go back again to Vtrecht,
without showing their commission, notwithstanding, that by the States of
Vtrecht, they were reiteratiuely willed and required to do it.

24
That he earnestly advised the said Deputies at their departure, to stand
against the assembly of a National Synod, and to urge the continuance of
their new companies of soldiers, as also, to keep good and strong watch both
at their gates and in their towns, adding thereunto, that if it fell out, that
at the first the business were not found out, and that the said new soldiers
should thereby, be longer held in pay, that then they should have cause
together with the interessed towns in Holland to enter into further
communication, upon the increasing, and assuring of the number of the new
soldiers, which they together should think fit for their necessary
assurance, and to find out means for the maintenance of them, by reciprocal
assistance among them: he also advertised diverse Deputies of the aforesaid
eight towns thereof.

25
That he also persuaded the town of Schonehouen, besides the ordinary and
common contributions by them to be disbursed for the necessary defense of the
land, and payment of the garrisons, to agree unto the raising and payment of
the new companies then raised. And also that he thought it convenient, and
winked thereat, that diverse towns (to the eminent danger of the land) gave
their consents with strange and unaccustomed exceptions.

26
That to make the service and counsel of his Excellency in all places
unprofitable and of no force, he sought to disgrace and scandalize his said
Excellency by diverse calumniations, and utterly to dishonor him, making men
believe that he sought to have the sovereignty of the Land in his own power,
and that he had practiced the same by premeditated counsel, at the very same
time and hour, that the necessity of the Commonwealth (in the highest
degree) required his said Excellencies advice, in secret assemblies of certain
Deputies for the government, being his confederates: with other such like
imputations; and that thereupon he also had conference with other Countries, by
letters written in ciphers, and by him sent abroad.

27
That he by certain persons expressly sent out in the night time, advertised
the Magistrate of Leyden, that his Excellency was to go from the Hage, and
that apparently he would go thither, that they therefore should stand upon
their guard, and advertise other their neighbor towns thereof, that they also
should look unto themselves. Upon which his advice it followed, that the
watch-bell being rung, the new soldiers and shot ran to arms at midnight, and
some towns in Holland by them were advertised with all speed to look unto
themselves as aforesaid: as also that the gates of the said town were kept
shut the next day after, until he gave them other advice, that his
Excellency was gone another way; although he had no intent of harm against
that, nor any other town.

28
That he confessed, that he was much grieved and discontented, when he
understood that the town of Brill, to prevent the sending of new companies of
soldiers thither, was guarded by the ordinary garrison of the General States,
therein placed by his Excellency, and that he wrought from Vtrecht to the
ordinary counsels of Holland and West-Freisland, to advertise and forewarne all
the towns of the said Provinces, to look well unto themselves.

29
That also to withdraw the ordinary soldiers from the obedience of the
General States and of his Excellency, he had labored by all the means he
could to make them to understand, that they were by oath bound, before all
others to obey the States of the particular Provinces, (their pay-masters)
though it were against the general States and his Excellency; as also that
they ought and were bound expressly to resist their commandments, whenever
they should undertake any thing contrary to the wills or resolutions of the
States of the Provinces, and the Magistrates of the towns wherein they should
lie in garrison.

30
And when the General States, perceiving that they could not by any serious
aduertisements or instances attain to the discharging of the new companies of
soldiers, thought it convenient to send other committies with his Excellency
to Vtrecht, he practiced and found means, that by very few Gentlemen, three
towns, and some counsel of State, which had no commission so to do,
Hoogerbeets, Grotius, and some others were appointed Committies to go to
Vtrecht, and there in the name of the States of Holland and West-Freesland, to
profer all aid and counsel to the States and Magistrates of Vtrecht, for the
staying and letting of the discharge of the new companies, giving letters also
to the commanders of the soldiers there, that were likely to be discharged,
(drawn by him the said prisoner) and yet not read in the assembly then holden;
whereby they were advertised that they were bound and obliged, to be true and
obedient to their pay-masters, together with the States of the respective
Provinces, wherein they lay in garrison, or were otherwise employed: and to
aid and assist them in upholding of all their resolutions, without doing or
attempting any thing, or suffering to be done or attempted to the contrary.

31
That he also affirmed, that the commission given to his Excellency, and other
their Committies of the General States, touching the discharging of the new
Companies, if it were done without the consent of the States of Vtrecht, was
contrary to the union, and would be a cause of force which might be used to
expel force, as well as they did and were compelled to do against the King of
Spain and his Governors; whereas he himself by his remonstrances given out in
writing shows, that all violent courses are corosiue and ruinous for the
state of the Land, and a right Spanish counsel, tending to the subversion and
utter ruin of these famous Provinces. Whereupon it followed, that the
aforesaid Hoogerbeets, Grotius, and other Deputies coming to Vtrecht, to the
intent aforesaid, secretly and in private assemblies, advised with some of the
States of Vtrecht, and the Secretary Ledenberch, made proposition touching
present resistance, and how to move the new companies thereunto, as also to
procure the ordinary soldiers, by virtue of the letter aforesaid, not to be
obedient to the commandments of his Excellency, and the Committies for the
General States, and to second them by the Artillery men of the town; to
appoint places for the said new soldiers to assemble in; to have diverse pieces
of ordinance ready, and that Monsieur Modesberghen and Ledenberch had told
them, that if they could find a means to keep the soldiers that were then in
ordinary pay of Holland, from stirring, that they had taken such order among
their new soldiers, that they would easily obtain their wills: and that also
the said Hoogerbeets with his accomplices, the day before the discharging of the
aforesaid new companies of soldiers, had delivered their letters to the
aforesaid ordinary soldiers.

32
That he had revealed the secrets of the Land, and contrary to the acts of
sovereignty, of his own authority, without the knowledge or consent of any
of the Provinces, refused and denied to accept of certain notable unexpected
alliance, which in the highest degree concerned the Common wealth.

33
That he procured diverse Courts of Justice (in the administration of their
offices) by diverse ways, and in several matters, contrary to the laws,
privileges, freedoms, and statutes of the Land, to use untrue dealing in the
administration of justice.

34
And that he, contrary to his oath, and by the instructions of some foreign
Princes, Lords, and others, received diverse great sums of money, and
presents, without making any that had to do therewith acquainted therewithal.
All which his proceedings, tending to the end not only to make the town of
Vtrecht a slaughterhouse, but also to bring the state of the Land, and the
person of the Prince of Orange into utter subversion, whereby, and by means of
all other his machinations and conspiracies, it is so fallen out, that States
against States, government against government, and new contracts in and against
the unity, and general perturbations in the state of the Land, as well
spiritual as temporal, are risen up, the treasure consumed, and the Country
compelled to an expense of many millions of crowns, general distrusts and
dissentions moved and brought in among the united Provinces, and the
inhabitants of the Land, the union broken, the Country made unfit and unapt to
defend it self, and brought into danger, to endure and suffer some scandalous
wrong, or utterly to be overthrown and subverted: which are matters of such
consequence, that they are not to be suffered in any government, but rather
ought to be punished, for an example to all others.

Therefore the Judges aforesaid, with deliberation of the counsel of the
States general, having well considered upon and weighed all the articles
aforesaid, wherein they concerned, or in any wise might tend to the matter in
question; doing justice, in the names and behalfes of the General States of
the united Provinces, have condemned, and by these presents condemn the said
prisoner, to be brought to the Inner Court, to the place thereunto appointed,
there to have his head stricken off, and all his goods, lands, and revenues to
be confiscated. Given in the assembly of the Judges aforesaid in the
Grauen-Hage, and executed the 13. of May 1619.

By order from the Judges aforesaid. Signed H. POTZ.

A PROCLAMATION made by the General States of the united Netherland Provinces,
for the holding of a general Fast, and day of Prayer for the good success of
the Synod, and peace and preservation of the LAND.
FOrasmuch as it is so fallen out, by means of misunderstanding disagreement,
and contentions within certain years hitherto happened, not only in the
Church, but also among the Commons of these Countries, and likewise in the
politic government and administration of justice: that some ambitious
persons, for the furtherance of their particular designs and ambitions, to the
great hinderance of the reformed religion, and special disadvantage of the
service of the Land, stirred up, sought to have reuersed and annihilated the
true religion, and together at one time, wholly to have ruinated and subverted
the state of the Land, if the National Synod had not been summoned and
called, by the advice of most famous, learned, well experienced, honest, and
godly persons, strangers, and Inhabitants of these Countries, to examine the
differences in matters of religion, and the same to extinguish and utterly
exterminate: as also, if we had not restored and reestablished the lawful
authority of government and justice, by lawful proceedings against the
contradictors and violaters thereof: And for that they have already proceeded
so far in the said National Synod, that the hardest and most important
controversies and questions, with great unity and one general consent, are
already determined and decided: And likewise that a lawful Judgment and
sentence is to be pronounced by the Judges thereunto appointed by the General
States of the united Netherland Provinces, against those that have in such sort
perturbed the state of the Land, in such manner that the affairs of these
united Netherlands both in spiritual and temporal matters, are apparent and
likely to incline unto a peaceable and quiet end: The General States of the
said united Netherland Provinces have thought it fit and convenient, and
likewise have fully determined, to proclaim a common and general Fast, and
day of public prayer, throughout all the united Netherland Provinces,
Territories, and Towns thereof, to be holden upon Wednesday the 17. of the
month of April, thereby and therein to praise and give thanks unto the most
mighty God for his grace and blessing, and with earnest zeal and penitent
hearts to pray unto and call upon him, that he would be pleased to continue his
said grace and blessing for the honor of his most holy name, and the planting
and restoring of the true reformed religion, together with the preservation and
maintenance of the justice and lawful authority of the said united
Netherlands, and the peace and tranquillity of the inhabitants of the same,
both in spiritual and temporal proceedings. That so, with a good harmony and
one consent, God Almighty may truly be called upon and served; the state of
the Land secured; and more and more prosper in their trade and continual
traffic; and all the counsels, machinations, and conspiracies of the enemies
of this Land broken and prevented, etc.
