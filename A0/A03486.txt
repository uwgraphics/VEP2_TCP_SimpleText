Degrees of comparyson
All adiectyues that betoken things that may be made ore or less. may receive
comparyson as fair more fair: less fair: most fair: lest fair. or else
fair. fayrer fairest

There be three degrees of comparison. the posytyf the comparatyf. and the
superlatyf

De cognitione positiui.
The posytyfis grounder and fundament of the comparatyf and superlatyf. without
excess. and he is not fourmed. as fair foul. white. black

De cognitione comparatiui.
The comparatyf passes his posytyf. With this englyssh word more. or less.
or else his englyssh ends in er. as more fair. lessc fair or fayrer. and
his latin ends in or. or else he has this aduerbe magus. or minus joined to
his posytyf. as doctior. or else magis doctus velminus doctus

De cognitione superlatiui
The superlatyf passes his posytyf. with this englyssh word most. or lest.
else his englyssh ends in yst. as most fair. lest sfayre. or fayryst and
his latin ends in mus. ma. mum. or else he has this aduerbe maxim. or
minime. joined to his posytyf. as doctissimus doctissima doctissimu^. or else
maxim doctus. maxim docta. maxim doctu^. minime doctus. minime docta. minime
doctum

Here is to be noted that all comparatyues be declyned after doctior. and all
superlatyues like bonus bona bonum

Deformatione comparatiui
The comperatiue is fourmed of his postif of his first case that ends in I.
by puttyng to this termination or. else us as doctus docta ctum. docti ctior
us. tenuis tenuis tenui tenuior us. felix cis. ci. felicior us

Out of this rule bee^ except these fix nownes following ye which make both
ye co^paratif and superlatif out of rule. as Bonus melior optimus. Malus peior
pessimus. Magnus mayor maximus. Paruus mi^or minimus. and paruissimus. Multus
plus plurimus Nequa^ nequior nequissimus. Also iuuenis makes junior Senex
senior. and lacks the neuter in us. and also the superlatyfdegre

Such adiectyues yt end in us. and have a vowel before us. have now no
co^peratyf in or but always this word magis. and ye posityf shall supply ye
romme of the co^peratyf. as pius magis pius. perpetuus magis perpetuus.
extraneus magis extraneus. In such ye superlatyf follows ye rule as pius
p^ssunus. strenuusissunus. If thou find any otherwise. it is excused by
antiqu^^e

Al nownes yt makes their co^peratyf in or may make the co^peratyf with magis
o^ minus. and the posityf

But such that end in us. with the vowel etc. man no wise make the co^paratyf
in or.

Other pertes of reason make comparison. as this verb. detero makes deterior
for his conperatyf. and deterimus for his superlatyf Also participles going
into nownes as ama^s ama^tior tissimus. These aduerb^s preposicyons in these
verses with many other m^^ make ye Co^peratyf and superlatyf indirectly. Versus

Ante. citra. prope. post. extra. supraque vel infra Intra. nuper. ocys.
vltraque. pridem. penitusque. Pene. penesque din. sepe

Ante anterior caret superlatiuo

Citra citerior citiinus Prope. propior. proximus Post. posterior. postreinus
Extra. exterior. extremus. etextimus Supra. superior. supremus etsummus Infra.
inferior. infimus Intra. interior. intimus Nuper. nuperior. nuperrimus Ocys

penitior penitissimus Pene velpenes. penior. penissimus Diu. diutior.
diutissimus. Sepe. sep^us. sepissime.


There be also some nownes that makes their co^paratyf in rule. and lack
their superlatyf. as Serus serior. Celsus. celsior

De formatione superlatiuorum
The superlatifis fourmed of his postyf of ye first case yt ends in I. by
puttyng to s and simus. as Doctus cta ctum. docti. doctissimus. Felix. felicis.
felici. felicissimus Except is posityf end in er. For then he makes the
superlatyf by puttyng to rimus. as Niger nigerrimus Saluber. saluberrimus. with
double rr

Save Dexter makes always dexti^us. Sinister sini stinius Also facitis makes
facillimus with double ll. So does agilis make agillimus. gracilis gracillimus.
humilis humillimus. et similis simillimus. with their compoundes Also maturus
makes maturimus and maturissinuis. vetus veterimus.

These. ij. superlatyf degrees. Intimus and Proximus. may sometime be as
posytyfes. and has for there comparatyfes. intimior and proximior. and lacks
their superlatyfes.

Al adjectives incus that com of dico. facio and loquor change us in entior.
for the co^paratyf. and in entissimus for the superlatyf. as Magnificus centior
cen tissimus. fatidicus centior centissimus. gra^diloquus. quentior
quentissimus. If thou find any otherwise it is excused by antiquite. as
mirificio ^^irificissimus.

Declynson and division of pronownes
Here be. xv. pronownes bysyde their co^poundes as. Ego. tu. sui. ille. ipse.

The three concordes in Grammar
THere be but three concordys in Grammar. The first betwyxt the nominatif or the
vocatyf and the verb.

The secounde bitwyxt the adiectif and the substantyf.

The third bytwyxt the relatyf and the antecedent. It has been said there be
two more. but learned men reduce them to the secounde. as rosa est pulcherrimus
florum. where is vnsterstonde this substantyf flos. Alter istorum currit. where
is understand Vir. Puer. or some other like.

The first Concord
The verb presonal and his nominatyfor vocatyf case must agree in two
accidents. Noumbre and person. as Ego amo. O virgili ama

Here is to be noted that if I shall make an english in latin. I mustre hearse
it till I have it perfytly and see how many verbes be in the same reason. and
if there be put one. he is the principal verb then must I put before him this
questyon who or what. and that word that answers to the questyon. shall be
the nominatif or vocatyf to the verb. as the master techeth this word
techeth is the verb who. or what techeth the master. this word master. here
answers to this questyon. and therefore it shall be nominatyf case as magister
docet. And like wise of the vocatyfe. as Virgyll love. Virgili ama

If onythynge comes after the verb I must put before the verb this questyon.
whom or what. and that word answers to this q^stion whom or what shall be the
accusatyf case most commenly as The master techet me. whom or what does he
thechet? me. this word me. answers to this question. who^ or what. and
therefore it shall be the accusatif case to the verb. as magister docet me.
Virgyll love God. Virgili ama deum.

But and if the word that follows the verb may conveniently answer to this
questyon of whom. or of what. it shall be put in the ablatyf case with one of
these preposicyons A. ab. abs. De. E. Ex. as I am beat of the maystre. Vapulo a
preceptore

Two noi^atyf cases singular with a coniunctio^ coputlatyf etc. will have a
verb plurel al way. Except the reason be figuratyf. vt planius post pacebit.
as Johannes I Robertus currunt.

One nominatyf case singular with an ablatyf ca se having this preposicyon
Cum. bytwyxt them if they be coupled to some sentence. be of the same
strenghte. as Petrus cum Paulo coronabuntur in celis Oratores cum poeta
loquuntur

A nowne of multitude in the nomi^atif case singular is of the same strenght.
as Turba strauerunt vestimenta sua in via

When I have two noi^atifes cases one of the first person and an other of the
secound. else of the third the verb shall always acce^de with the nominatyf
case of the first person. as Ego and tu sumus. Viretego stan^us

Also if I have a noi^atif case of the secounde person and an other of the
third the verb shall accord with ye nominatyf case of the secounde. and not
of the third as Tu and frater tuus estis discipuli.

The secounde concord
The adiectyf and the substa^tyf must agree in. iij. acci dentes. ge^dre.
nou^bre. and case. as vir doctus legit

Here is to be noted that two substa^tyues singular with a coniunctyon
copulatyf coming between. or else having this preposicion cu^ will have an
adic^tyf plurel. as Ioha^nes and robertus sedent scribentes. Petrus cum paulo
sunt ^oromandi in celo.

And when I have two substantyues cominge togydre one of the masculyne gendre.
and an other of the feminyn. or of the neuter joined with an adiectyf than shall
the adiectyf agree with the substantif of the masculyne in gendre. and like wise
it is bytwyxt the feminyne and the neutre. as Ego and soror me a sumus albi.
soror tua and iumentum estis pulchre For like as the first person is more
worthy then the secounde. or the third. so is the masculine more worthy then
the feminyn or the neutre

Also when so ever I have a nowne or a pronowne adiectyf. I must put to this
questyon. who. whom. or what. after him. and then always the word that answer
the. shall be the substa^tyf. as much breed much what breed. my gown. my what
gown

If the adiectyf be a partitiple. this questyo^ must goo before. as growing
trees. who or what grown trees.

Here is generally to be noted that all words that stand as one person.
must ever be put in one case and all that be in une case. stand as one
person. There fore it is comynly said. that all yt longs to one thing shall
be put in one case. as My fader a man loves me a child. Pater meus vir.
diligit me pueru^. My mother a wooman loves me a child. Matter mea mulier
diligit me puerum

The third concord
The third is bytwyxt the relatyf of substance, and his antecede^t. the which
must ever agree in. iij. accidents Gendre. noumbre. and person. how be it
he may discord with the verb sometime in person. as Equus quem video currit

Here is to be understand that there be two manner of relatyues. One of
substance. And one of accydence. The relatyf of substance requires a
substa^tyf for his antecedentes. as Qui. Ille. Ipse. Sui. Is. and Idem. The
relatyf of accidence reherseth an adiectyf for his antecedent. as Talis.
Qualis. Tantus. Quantus.

Also when I have a relatyf of substance. I shall put after him this question
who. whom. or what. and that word that answers to this question shall be ye
anteredent to the relatyf. as Virgyll is deed ye which was a poet. The which
what. Virgyll. This word Virgyll answers to the questyon. and therefore it is
his antecedent

This relatyf Quiis known by these signs. that who me. or the which

When there comes a nomiatyf case bitwyxt the relatif and his next verb. than
shall the relatif be such case as the verb will have after him as Ego quem
p^eceptor docet aduerto.

And when no nominatyf case. and cetera. The relatyf shall be the nominatyf
case to the verb as Ego qui sedeo scribo

It is to be noted also. that the relatyfe may agree with his antecedent
in.iiij. Ge^dre. Case. Noumbre and person. as Homo monetur. Ide^ homo currit

(When his word that comythe in a reason if I may put this englyssh the whyce
in his place it shall be made by this relatyf Qui if not so that it report any
thing a fore said bysom pronoune relatyfe, if hit betokyng schewyne by Ille.
illa. illud. Or some other pronownes demonstratiues. and when it be tokeneth
a thing. as willed to be done by. Vt and a thing as telling the cause by
quod or quia or other casual conjunctions

Conjunctions copulatyries and disiunctyues dubitatyue and interrogatyues will
join commonly like Case. Gendre. Noumbre. Mode. and Tens

Also two antecedentys singular with an E^ conjunction copulatyf coming
bitwene. will have a relatyf plurel. as Johannes and Robertus quos ego docui
non discunt delige ^^er

Wha^ne I have a relatyf coming bitwene two substanyues of diverse gendres
longyng both to one thing. If the substantyf that follows be appelatyf.
then the relatyf may accord with either of them indifferently. as in
Gendre. as Eo Oxoniam. que vel qui est locus studendi.

But and if the substantyf that follows be a now ne propre. the relatyf shall
accord with the latter always in gendre. as Est locus incarcere quod tul^ia^u^
appellatur

Wha^ne there be many verbes in a reason. ever more the first verb shall be the
princypall verb Except he come sone after one of these signs That whom. or
the which. or any of these. If. But. whenne. after that. before that.
although. Since. Except or other like. Or else after any of these latin words.
Si quamuis. etce. Or else after any of these signs To. or To be as To love. or
to be loved

Here is to be noted. that where as many verbys be in a reason. that verb is
princypalle that ma keth the reason persyte

Also where as be many verbys. one verb at the lest wise comes bytwyxt the
forsade signs. and the principalle verb. as the book that I begin to write
if it were ended should profit chyldre much. Liber quem incipio scribere. si
perfieretur multum pro desset pueris

A pronowne relatyf may not be set in that same rea son. that his antecedente
is in. But evermore he makes a reason imperfyte in himself

A pronowne relatyf maybe set in one reason with his antecedent. as Patrem
sequitur sua proles. Sua cuique satis placebant. dominum (...) dabunt

Stre^nght of compulynge case
The verb of substance. and all that be of like englyssh will have such case
after them. as they have before them. as I am a man. Ego sum vir

The same strenght has all verbes vocatyues. as Nominor. Appellor. Nuncupor.
etce. I am called thomas. Ego vocor thomas. Also appareo. sedeo. with other like

And generally all verbes may couple like case whenne the word that goes
before the verb and the word that comes after the verb long both to one
thing. as Iaicus no^ seder iudex in causis ecclesiasticis

Note well.
A* nominatyf else a vocatyf may not stand with out a verb finite set out.
or understand

Nor like wise a verb finite without a nomina tif or vocatyf case

A verb is called finite in all modes. Except the i^finityf. Also every
Infinityf mode may have an accu satif case set before him expressyd or
understand. as for such manner of spech. Cui nunc cognomee^ Iulo. Is more after
use than craft

Nor an aduerbe may not stand without a verb. Not a coniuncuo^ with out two
clauses. and two verbes set ou^e. as Ego lego. and tu legis. Or vndersto^ de.
as Lego virgilium and ciceronem for lego virgilium and lego ciceronem

Nor two clauses. or two verbes without a co^iu^ctyon. Except that one be an
Infinityf mode, or else joined with a relatyf

Nor a preposicyon without a case. Not an adiectyf without a substantyf. Nor a
relatyfe without some word rehearsed. of ye reason before. the which may be
called the antecedent

Not a relatif without a verb diverse from the verb of the antecedent. if the
relatyf be a nowne

When words must be construed togydre betokenynge things that be as one
person. they must agree in as many accydentes as they may

A person is called in gramer. the beer. the doer. the sufferer. the hauer.
the thing that is had. that. yt grows to. as advantage.. or hurt. anger. or
pleasure. Also price. time. instrumente. and other like

Accidents I call. Case. Gendre. Nou^bre Person. Mode. and Tens. etc

This infinityf mode Esse. when he comes after any of these verbes. Volo
soleo. cupio. incipio. disco. or any other like standing personally will have
after him a nominatyf case. after the use of greeks what so ever be understand
before. as Volo esse rex. Soleo esse amicus. Cupio esse doctus. Disco esse
pater. etc.

But and if the verb that comes before esse be impersonall. the word that
follows shall sometime be the datyue case. Licet mihi esse bono. Placet tibi
esse regi

The wythspe king though it be approved by the use of Greeks. and latyns. yet
it is not after the craft

Nownes of the co^paratyue degree will have after them an ablatif case, wha^
this sign than. follows them. as I am wyser than these Sum doctior ijs. And
a genityf when this sign of follows them. as This is the wyser of yout^^yne.
Hic est doctior vestrum duorum

The superlatyue will have a genityf plurell of all words. except the nowne of
multitude. of whom he is content. with a genityf case singular. as Virgilius
erat doctissimus poetarum. Troiane gentis fortissimus erat Hector

Euerry verb is construed with case after his significacyon. Therefore if it be
not englysshed after his constructyon. it is not englysshed after his
significacyon Wherefore these verbes Noceo and placeo. and such other the with
have after them adatyue case. must have these englysshes I do grieve. I do
pleasure. and contrary wise ^edo and offendo. I hurt and offend rather than I
do hurt. or offense. and like wise in one verb. as Vaco tibi. I take heed to
the.Vaco doctrine. I lack konnynge But where it is hard to englyssh them
after their constructyon. We must go as nygh as we may, and for their
construction to be known say generally that all verbes actyues. deponentes and
communes may have after them an accusatyf case. or somewhat set in the stead
of it. as Amo Loquor Veneror oratione^. Amo legere. Cupio vt legas. and so they
have the nature of actyues.

(Al verbes may have after them a da^yf case to the thing the which is
gyuynge. sendinge. vauntage. or damage. or such other like. of the same
stre^gthe be all verbes that be token proferrynge or comparyson. as Homo
prestat homini

Every verb adiectif that has no passif sign with his englyssh. may have
after him an accusatif case. of a word that is of the same significacyo^. or
else that mesureth his significacyon. and so is as an actyf. as Curro cursum.
or stadium. or multum. Viuo vitam infelicem

Every verb may have after him an ablatyf case that stands as price.
dotynge. or armare

And generally of all verbes that be as instrument as Emi equum centum nummis.
Induo te tunica Percussus pugione

Out of this rule be except adjectives of vncerte^ price the which shall ever
be put in the genitif case singular. and neutre gendre substantyuate if they be
with substantyues. as Magni iuterest. parui constat

But and if the substantyf be expressed. they shall both be put in the ablatif as
Penus emitur magno p^ecio vel multa pecunia

To these be reduced verbes be tokenynge. lacking as Careo Vaco

Also such verbes Exulo. Spolio. Nubo. Priuo Also verbes be tokenyng inouynge
will have after them the first supine. or else the gerundiue in du^ with this
preposicion ad. as. Eo cubitum. vel ad cubandu^

And where this general rule will not satisfye. we must say specially. that
some verbes will have after them a genityf case. as In^^^^lo. accuso. (...)
recordor. potior. and misereor. Some with the ablatyf (...) passive with the
accusatyf. as Grauor. doceor. postulor. To these be reduced two particyples.
Exosus. and percesus. as Exosus contubernium. pertesus ignauiam

The ablatyf case absolute
When so ever I have in a reason a Nowne. or a pronowne substantyf. With a
nowne. pronowne. or particyple adiectyf coming togedre without any verb or
other word of whom they may be governed. they shall be put in the ablatyf
case. which is called the ablatyf case inconsequente If there come a nominatyf
case with his verb hanging other before or after. as Caesar reynynge. Virgyll
was borne. Cesare regnante. Virgilius natus est. vel natus erat.

This case is called absolute or inconsequente by cause that he is lowsed from
de power of all governance, and stondeth in a reason. as the master techy^
ge. the scolers must take heed. Docente preceptore discipulos oportet anim^^
^^uertere.

I being deed. thou salt lack help. Mortuo me indige his aurilio

Praynge or besechynge. It shall be put in a geru^dyf in Do. with this
preposicyo^ de before him. Or else I may take the coniu^ctyf mode. as Ore te de

Also whe^ne the englyssh of a particyple of the presentens with this englyssh
sign of alore him coe^th after a own adiectyf it may be put in a geru^dyf in
do with these preposicyons In or De. vel sine prepositione si placet. as I

put in a geru^ dyf in Do with this prepostcio^ In or without si placet as
scolers in taking heed grow to co^nynge. Scholastici aduerte^do vel in

Cicero Ex quo ardescit sieve amor. sieve amicitia. vtru^que enim dictum est ab

epyru^ scire sane velim. Edisce^do aliquid co^modi capio. Ex defendendo quam
accusando vberior gloria comparatur

Also I may have a geru^dif in do. without a prepo sicyo^ when I have these
english words. when. whil se. or as^o^ge. joined with a passyf
significa^yo^. as as lo^g^ as mind is occupied. it is encressed as al other

co^iunctif mood. as whiles thou playest. thou forgetest much thing Inter
ludendu^. multa de discis Virgilius. Age tytire and inter agendu^ occursare
capro cornu ferit ille caueto

When the euglyssh of the Infinityf mode follows this englyssh. It is it may
be put in a gerundyf in Dum with this verb est. set impersonally. and that
that seems to be the noi^atyf shall be the datyf. as The king it is to fight.

eundu^ est in oppidum

After al such verbes that betoke^ calling showing. mouynge. or rest. I shall
evermore have a gerundyf in Dum. and never the Infinityf mode. as Vocaui te ad
currendu^. no^ currere. Surgo ad audiendu^. no^ audire. Sto ad pre dandu^. non
predari

But these verbys following. the Infinityf. and not the gerundyf. as Iubeo re
arare. no^ ad arandu^. cogito timeo edificare. no^ ad edificandu^. Su^ be
indifferent to both. as Hortor te studere. and ad stude^du^. Flagitor. paratus

will have the geru^ dyf and leave the infinityf mode.

the doing of a thing without any respect of the time. as Sum or oc^patus in
docendo pueros. or in docendis pueris

The perricyple in Dus betokens a thing to be done in time to come. as
Chremes est exotandus a me

Between In doce^do pueros. and In doce^dis pueris is this difference that in
docendo pueros. is of ye acryfsignificacyon. and may be exponed outher by the
nowne verbale in io. or by the present Subiunctyf. and vt occupatus sum in
doce^do pueros. for in doctione puerorum. or Vt doceam pueros In doce^dis
pueris. is of ye passyf and passuely exponed. as Occupatus sum in docendis
pueris. for vt doceantur And generally all gerundyf be actyfly expowned except
they sto^de absolutely. as Vritque videndo. i. du^ videantur. illustria ad
cognoscendum. hoc est cognoscantur

The geru^dyf in do has these preposicyo^s In o^ De as In or De tra^sen^do in
epyru^. with E and Ex. Aor. ab as Ex discede^do Ab audie^do. with cum. as Cum

many other like. as Do filia^ (...). Co^cedo edes venu^. (...) a te spectatu^.

the co^peratif and superlatif degree as Quo quid magis abhominabile eo turpius
dicto? Et qua^to magis est aliqd studiosum. ta^to dignius honoratu. Optimu^
fa^^^ quid sit ne scio. Dignissimu^ intellectu est illud opus. Also I may have
the lat^re Supyne after all these nownes adiectyues in all gendres. and
nou^bres. scz Dignus. turpis. rarus. iocundus. absurdus. seuerus. seuus.
obseuus. superbus. austerus. clarus. durus. and al other of like significacyo^.
as Naso dignus lectu. Res digna visu. Pecus dignu^ amatu.

Also it is to be noted that Supines may in no wise be joined with adiectyues
in co^formyte of case gendre and nou^bre Nor they may not be governed of no
preposicyon Also they have no case but always be verbes Also they be not
gou^erned of verbes. nor of perticyples but of adiectyues. vt Miserabilis visu.
i. vt videatur Also they be of affiny^e with the Infinityf mode

De infinitiuo modo
When. ij. verbes come togedre without a relatyf or a ce^ iunctio^ coming
between them the lattre verb shall be the infinitif mode. as Volo legere. cupio
doceri. And one Infinityf mode may cause one other verb to be the Infinityf
mode. as dicome non posse venire Therentius ai^se videre ^e cupere

Such adiectyues Dignus. indignus. iocundus. letus. tristis. be enjoined better
to the infinityf mode tha^ to ye gerundyf. vt Tues dignus habere opes. Tues
dignus honorari. Tu es letus me bn^ valere Tu es letus me honorari Moreover
wheresoever I take the Infinityf mode of the prefentens or preterperfitens of
ye passif significacyon. there I may take the latter supyne o^ the same verb.
as Tu es dignus honorari vel honeratu. sed non versa vice

Also whenso ever I take the first supine. there I may take the neutre gendre
substantiuate with this preposicyon ad. or the gerundifin Dum. vt Curro locutum
regi. vcl ad loquendum regi

De participijs
When the englyssh of the particyple of the prese^tens else of the infinityf
mode of the aciyf significacyo^ comes after any tens of Sum es fui. I shall
make the vulgar by the said verb Sum. and the particyple in Rus. as I am
going forth from home in to the country. as I am to go. and cetera.
Profecturus sum domo rus. and like wise of other tenses. as Lecturus eram
martilogium. Auditurus eram grammaticam Fuit visurus rhomam si vixisset pater.
Like wise I may make such englysshes of the future tens. I will soupe before
five of the clock. Sum cenaturus ante quin tam. The saudiers shall fight in
batel Milites pugna turisunt in bello. And if the englyssh of the said
infinityf mode. be of the passyf significacyon. or comes after the sign must.
should. or ought. it shall be made by the said verb Sum. and the particyple of
the gerundyf in Dus. as These oxen be to selle. or to be sold. hi boues sunt
vende^di. Chyldre must be chastysed Pueri sunt castigandi

(Also the particyple in Dus. goth sometime in to the strength of a nowne. and
than he betokens as much. as Dignus digna dignu^. with an infiuitif. mode of
the passyf significacyon. vt Iste liber est lege^dus id est dignus legi
vellectu. etc.

There is a difference bytwixte the first supyne and the particyple in Rus. For
the first supyne comes after the verb that betokens mouynge and he him
silfe signifies bodily deed

But the particyple of the first future most commonly comes after verbes that
betoken rest. and he nouther betokens mouynge nor bodily deed. But al only a
time to come uncertain. Example of the supyne. Eo cenatum. eo cubicum. Example
of the particyple in Rus. as Ego quidem cenaturus sum. Non tame^ eo cenatum. Et
scio te cenaturum esse. sed non protinus ire cenatum

De circunlocutione modi Indicatiui. Optatiui. and Coniunctiui
All te^ses of the forsayde modes that are made by circu^locucyon ar made by
Su^es fui. and a particyple i^ Tus or in Sus. so that there be co^formite of
case. gendre. and nou^bre. bytwyxt the particyple and the noi^atif case to the
verb. as Vir est amatus. virgo amata est, Capud amatu^ est. Viri amati sunt
Virgins amate sunt. Capita amata sunt. In verbes passiues and such that has
circunlocutio^ the imperatyf mode may have pretertenses not of his own words
but using for them preterper. and plu. of the co^iunctyf. as Doctus es vel
esto. doctus sit vel esto. ornatus es vel esto. ornatus sit vel esto. Locutus
sis prius quam ad me redeas: and this virtue such spech has that what we
command. may be paste in a certain time to comes. vt causa sit mox fenestra.
Post horam sit iuratus. Auto^e pusciano in secumdo Mi^^^s

De circunlocutione modi Infinitiui preteritiperfecti and plusquam perfecti
The circu^locucyon of ye preterperfitens and plupersite^s of the forsayde mode
of ye passyf voice is evermore made with one of these. ij. words Esse or
fuisse. and the perticiple in tus. with co^formite of case. ge^die. and nou^bre
by twixte the perticyple. and the casuel word that goth before the Infinityf
mode. as Vir dicebatur amatus fuisse Virgo amata fuisse. Caput amatu^fuisse.
Viri ama ti fuisse. Virgins amate fuisse. Capita amata fuisse Et similiter de
Esse.

De circunlocutione futuri temporis acti^i significationis modi Infinitiui
The circu^locucyo^ of the future tens of ye actyf voice of ye foresaid mode is
made with this infinityf mode Ire. and the perticiple in Tus or Sus Or else
with this infinityf mode Esse and the perticyple in Rus with co^formite of case
ge^dre and nou^bre bytwixte ye perticiple and the casual word. Also ye said
future te^s betokens time. mouynge. and bodily deed. as Volo te amatu^ire.
vel ama turu^ esse me. Amata^ ire. vel amatura^ esse me. etc

De circunlocutione futuri temporis passive significationis ante dicti modi
The circu^locucyon of the future tens of the passif significacyo^ is evermore
made with this infinityf mode (...) and the perriciple in Tus or i^ Sus. or
else with this infinityf mode Ee^, and ye perticyple in D^us with co^fo^^^es of
case gendre and nou^bre betwyxt the perticyple and the casuel word. as
Intelligo. scio. credo. video. opinor. existimo peccaru^ (...) facie (...) esse
vel pati factu^ iri. Neglige (...) facienda^ esse vel pati facta^ iri.

Save it is to be noted that ye particyple in Tus or in Sus. with all
circo^locucyons of the future tens of the actyf significacyo^. betokens time
present at hand. as Video te accusat^^^ ire me. id est mu^^ anglice. I see
that now thou do accuse me.

Also the perticyple in ^us. with all circu^locucions of the future tens of the
actyf significacyo^ betokens uncertain time without end. as Nu^c video te
accusaturu^ esse me. anglice Now I see thou will o^s accuse me. i. post hac
te^pore incerto. But all circu^locio^s of ye future of the pas^^^ significacio^
betokens both time and deed present. and to come indifferently as video me
accusatu^ iri abs re. i. video re vel accusatu^ ire me vl accusaturu^ esse me
etc. anglice. I see I am accused of the now or else I see I shall be accused of
the herafter

Exulo. Vapulo. Veneo. Liceo
Whe^ne soever I am compelled to make a latin by one of these. iiij. verbes
Exulo. Vapulo Veneo. and liceo that thing yt does the deed. shall be ye ablatyf
with a preposicyon. and the sufferer shall be the noi^atyf case. as ye king has
banysshed many a^raytour A rege multi traditores exularu^t. The master beteth
scolers. A prereptore vapula^t discipuli. The fysshers sell their fysshe dear A
piscarijs pisces care veneu^t Thou do appreyt te thy servant. A te tuus
seruus licet

Nubo
This verb Nubo bis. has evermore a nomi^atyf case of the woman and a datyf
of the ma^in all common speches as my brother has wedded thy suster. Fratri meo
nupsit soror tua. I shall wed thy mother. Mihi nubet matertua

De hoc vulgaris signo etc
When soever there comyth a propre name of a place or town after this
englisshe sign at. It shall be put in the genitif case. so that it be the
singular nou^ bre. and the first declinson. or the secounde. as I learn grammar
at Oxforde. Disco grammaticam Oxonie. I dwelled a while at york Manebam
aliquam diu Eboraci

But and if the forsayde propre name be ye third declynson or the plurel
nou^bre. It shall be put in the ablatyf case without a preposicyon. as Thou
waste borne at Chartage. Tu eras Thartagine natus. Thou dyddest study at
athenys. Studuisti athenis

Moreover I may take an accusatyf case. or else an ablatyf of ye forsayde
nownes. with a preposicyon of a convenient significacyo^. as Manes apud
chartagine^ and so of al other. as sum apud Londonias

De hoc vulgari signo To
Whansoeuer I have a propre name of a place after this englysh sign To. it may
put in the accusati ue case with a prepostcyon. or without indifferentli
what noumbre or declynson soever he be. as Eo oroniam. vel ad oxoniam
Londonias. vel ad londonias Chartaginem. vel ad chartaginem

De hoc vulgari signo Fro
When soever there come a propre name of a place after this englyssh sign fro.
it shall be put in the ablatyf case wych a preposicyon or without in differently
what noumber orde (...) ever he be. as Venio oxonia vel ab oxonia. (...). vel a
lo^donijs. Chartagine. vel a chartagine These rules be always true except the
propre name of town or place be compouned for then I must have evermore an
accusatyf case or an ablatyf with a preposicion of a co^uerie^t significacyo^.
as Eo ad sanctu^ Iacobu^. Fui apd terra^ sanctam. Venio a sancto Iacobo. vel a
terra sancta

Rus. Domus. Humus. Militia
These. iiij. nownes. Rus. domus. humus. and militia follows the rules of the
said propre names of places. as maneo ruri. venio rure. vado rus. Su^ domi. eo
domu^. proficiscor domo. etc.

Of the same governance we find Belli. Duelli and many other indiuerse
autours. The which every ^hon be aduerbes always without they be joined to the
said preposicyons. vt supra

Penitet. Tedet. Piget. Miseret. Pudet
These. v. verbes in iperso nalles Penitet. anglice to be sorye. or to repent.
Tedet. and Piget. anglice to be weary. or to have no lust Miseret anglice to
have pity or mercy. or to be sorry for favor. Pudet. anglice to be as hamed.
govern an accusatyf case in the stead of ye no minatyf and a genityf of the
thing that we be sorry fore. or have pity of. weary or ashamed of. as I repent me
for my lewdenes. Me penitet mei maleficij. Tedet anima^ mea^ vite me. I am
sorry for thy loss. Me (...). calamitatis. Nos pudet nostrorum p^^o^rum.. Te
pigeat inunensi laboris

Iuuat. Dilectat. Deret. Oportet. Latet
These. v. verbes impersonels Iuuat and dilectat. anglice to desire or have
pleasure. Decet oportet. anglice to must. or to be bound and Latet. anglice to
(...) or to cannot tell have also evermore an accusaif case of that. yt seems
to be the noi^atyf. as Me iuuat veldi lectat ludere. Te decet vel oportet
ascultare preceptori Nos latet doctus ne es an stolidus

Interest. Refertest
These. iij. verbes impersonallees Interest. refert. and est. anglice to be
profitable or according has evermore a genitif case of the word that seems
to be the nominatyf. as Fratris mei interest amare me

Out of this rule be except these. v. pronownes primatyues Ego. tu. sui. nos
and vos. and this nowne interrogatyf Quis instead of whom I shall take ye
ablatif case feminyne ge^dre and singular non^bre of them possessyues That is
to say Mea. tua. sua. nr^a. vestra. and tui^. as Mea interest discere. Tua
interat docere. Sua interfuit andire. Nr^a interfuerat cauere. Vestra intererit
monuisse. who is bound totel ye truth? but he that knows all the matter Cuia
interest enarrare veritatem nisi sua qui nouit omnem rem

Also when I have any such englyssh. It is my office. my duty. or my perte. It
longs for. It behooves. It is good reason. or according. or any such other
yt encludeth duty I may conveniently occupy one of the se. v. verbes. Decet.
Opo^tet. Interest. Refert. de Est With the forsayde governance of case.

Al these verbes in these verses following may have (...) of the person that
the deed lo^geth to. as Mihi licet ludere. Thou taryst not wherer. I live or
dye Tibi no^ vacat inorearne an viuam Versus

Her liber atque. licet liquet. and patet. accidit atque

Congruit. euenit. attinet. expedit and licet add

Pertinet. incumbit. vacat. and sedet addito co^stat

Conuenit and prestat. contingit. iunge sa^^^^it

Sufficit ad ternos. cum competit aduoco casus

All verb impersonalles of the passyf voice govern before them an ablatyf
with a preposicyon. else a datif of the person that does ye deed. as Ame vel
mihi amatur and after them an accusatif or an ablatif with a preposityon. but
never without as Ame(...) antiquam siluam. Ame auditur. Ame statur in foro

Save other while they may have after the^ such cases as has ye verbes that
they be diriues of. as Ame seruitur tibi. Interdictum^ est tibi aqua et igni.

Evermore before the Infinityf mode of a verb impersonall of ye passyf voice I
must express ye ablatif with a preposicyon of the do^^. as Volo a me amati id
est volo amare. Volo a me seruiri. i. volo seruire

Benefit. Malefit. Satisfit
These verbes Benefit. malefit. and Satisfit. will have before the^ an ablaf
case with a preposicyo^ of ye doer. and after the^ a datyf case of ye (...) Ame
benefit tibi

Whenever there ^emeth any of these. ^t. signs (...). act. Is was. were. or
be. before a verb (...) betokens bodily mouyng I may ever more take ye
preterperfytens of the Indicatyf mode or some other yt is formed of him. as ye
vulgar (...) the preterperfytens of the Indicatif mode (...) bysyde his own
strenght. both for the presentens and the preterimperfytens And so he and all
tenses formed out of him have the passyf significacyon. as my master is come.
Preceptor meus venit. my folowes bengoon. Mei condiscipuli abierunt

How many perticyples come of a verb Impersonal of the passyf voice? one.
which one? A perticyple of the pretertens and the neutre gendre only. as Nto^
hoc oppositu^. ablto^ ab hoc opposito. and he has after him a datife case. as
Mihi prius opposito tibi opponetur

Incipit. Desinit Debet. Potest. Solet. Vult These. vi. verbes Incipit.
Desinit. Deber. Potest Solet. and Vult. joined to the Infinityf mode of verbes
impersonalles be impersonalles and will have before them such cases as will the
verbes impersonalles. as me incipit te de^^s vigilie. Mihi desinit placere
studij. me debet pudere maleficij. bonos solet penite re flagitij. me vult
delectare dormire. Else they be al way verbes impersonalles. and have before
them a nominatyf case. as Volo legere. etc

Pono. Fers
These two verbes actyues Pono and Fero compowned with pre. or ante. be thus
englyshed. to tell more price. to set more by. to love better, to have lever
will have after them an accusatyf case of thing that we make most of. and a
datyse. of the thing) we make leest of. as Prepono virtutem vicus. I am
neminem prepones Ca^^^i. Prefero (...) Nescio vtru^ altria^ feram

And of this (...) be al these verbs with many other such. as Valeo es.
preponder^ as presto as anglice vt prius. as Ingenio vales

Item other while with an ablatyf with a preposicon. vt Tullius ad modum valuit
in genere dicendi ternatius numerus preponderat binario

Postpono
But postpono is of contrary co^structyon. to Antepono. as Postpono aud^um visui

Cello. Eo. Cedo
These iij. verbes Cello. Eo. and Cedo. co^powned with Ante. pre. or extra.
anglice to pass. excede. excelle or be better. govern before them a noi^atyf
case of ye thing that we make most of. and after them an accusatyf of the
thing. vt supra as I pass far al my brethren both in (...) and redynge.
Ego ante cello o^^es fratres meos and scribendo and legendo. Also ablatyf (...)
with this preposicyon In. vel sine si placet. of the thing that we compare in.
as Thou excedest me in might. as much as I pass the in conynge. Tu antere
disme fortitudine. vel in fortitudine tanto. qua^to ego ante cello te scientia
Virgilius ante cellit alios poetas carmine. vel in carmine

The same stre^ght has Supero as. and all other verbes that has the forsayde
englyssh

Wha^ no word lacks in a reason to the most perfyt sentence. than it is
called full. as Ego lego virgiliu^

And wha^ any thing that is required to perfyt sentence lacks if it be used
to be understood by ye (...) stomes of romans ye reason may be called
figurate as Lego litteras. where must needs be understood Ego and the sign is
called Eclipsis

There be customably understo^de in latin tongue these with every relatyf the
word that it reherseth of the reason before in the same case. gendre. nou^bre.
and person. as the relatyf is. as Lego virgiliu^ qui est poeta. Where is
understand with qui virgilius. or else more general. as Stude nam ea res
proderit

Often time the word that the relatyf reherseth is expressed with the relatyf.
and understand before. as Vrbem quam statuo vestra est. Where is understand
before Est this word vrbs

Also in answers como^ly the verb that is in the asking. as to this asking.
Quis est. if I say Ego. is understand Sum

Also Ego. tu. meus. tuus. suus. as Verb ero filiu^ Where is understand Ego.
and after filiu^. meu^. tuum or suum. as the matter requires

Sus es est. as Bonu^ discere. Doctior quam ille Where is understand Est.

Also Ens wherfoeuer. ij. or mo propres or appellatyues. or one propre. an
other appellatyf. come to gedre in one case and one clause without any verb
or coniu^ctyon between. as Vrbe^ rhoma^. for vrbe^ ente^ rhoma^

Also nownes after superlatyues when they (...) in gendre with the genityf
after them. as Pulcherrimum florum. where is understand flos

And after partityues. as after duorum hominu^ where is understand. homo. but
else they have the co^structyon of adiectyues

Also coniunctyons of (...) poetys else not. but the speaking be changed into
interragatiu^ or (...). as Surge pa^^. abi. where to understand twyse e^. and
specially vt before subiu^ctiues. as Fac mittas. for far vt mittas

Also preposicion with names of towns. as Vade rhoma^. Where is understood
ad. Veni rhoma where is understand a. also Fui thebis. where is understood
in. The which spekinge though it be figurate is when we say. fui rhome or
tare^ti. But there is ondersto^de beside the preposicyo^ In. locus. vrbs or
oppidu^

And like as in these ye figurat is more used then ye fulso is it in Statur
Curritur. where is understand Stacio. and cursus. And in all such. as Pluit.
tona^. fulminat. is understood Deus. And in these. v. verbys. Miseret. Tedet.
Penitet. Piget and Pudet. as often. as they have not an Infnityf with them. is
understood one of there own nownes miseratio. penite^tia. pudor to the which
nownes always perteyneth tho genityfe that follows these verbes. as Penitet me
tui. for penite^tia tui penitet or a afficit me. the accusatyfis joined to the
verb as an actyf

Sometime. ij. or more like clauses be closed to gedre with one word singular.
the which is understand in every clause. and set out in one. as Cicero
Virgilius Homerus scripsit. and of this speaking the figure is called zeugma

But of diverse clauses none like other in gendre. no sibre or person. be
clo^ed with one word, then in the figure. Sylepsis. and the word that closes
is wont to agree with the last. as Vir and mulier magna ad (...) Hic illius arma
(...)

But if the word that closes be plurell. then it must agree in gendre and
person with the cheef. as Ego and uxor amati sumus. in the which is sylepsis
in person and gendre. but not in noumbre

To this figure may be reduced such co^structio^s Vrbe^ qua^ statuo. and
Fabulas quas fecisset etc.

When. ij. or more things be generally compared in one word and afterward
specially set out. as Aqui le volaueru^t vna abone^te. alia ab occidente. then
is ye figure Prolepsis. ac.

Cetera pla^tus and plentus discesex Sulpitis.
