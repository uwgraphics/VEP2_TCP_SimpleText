Two unfortunate Lovers, or, a true Relation of the lamentable end of John
True, and Susan Mease:
Their lives this Ditty does relate, And how they died unfortunate. To the tune
of, The Brides Burial.
ATtend you lovers and give ear,
unto my mournful song,
Of two that loved faithfully,
yet each did other wrong.
At Coventy in Warwickshire,
this young man he did dwell,
His name John True a Shoemaker,
and lived of it full well.
At Corley did this Maiden dwell,
three miles from Coventry:
Yet for the love he bare to her,
often times he would her see.
And coming unto her one day,
he told to her his mind:
Susan, quoth he, I love thee dear,
be not to me unkind.
If thou can love and fancy me,
in heart and eke in mind:
I will prove loving unto thee,
and never be unkind.
Thy cheerful looks rejoice my heart,
and merry make my mind:
Sweet Susan then love me again,
be not to me unkind.
Good John I thank you for your love,
and wish ye't home to tarry,
I am too young for you to wed,
and have no mind to mary.
Where you do dwell are Maids good store,
of beauty fair and free,
Set not your love upon me then,
for I cannot love thee.
This answer struck him to the heart
as cold as any stone:
Then homewards straight he did repair,
with many a sigh and groan.
Wishing that he had nere bin borne,
or in his cradle died,
Unhappy man to love so true,
and yet to be denied.
Quoth he, I will to her again,
and hear what she does say,
It may be she may be more kind,
though first she said me nay.
Then coming to the town again,
he sent for her straight way,
Desiring her to speak with him,
but she did it denay.
Then did he sigh, lament and grieve,
and knew not what to say,
Then did he take his pen in hand.
and writ these words straight way;
My hearts delight and only joy,
kill not me with disdain,
Uouchsafe that I may speak with thee
and rid me of my pain.
Resolve me sweetest I thee pray,
why is thy hatred such?
I know no cause, unless it be
for loving thee to much.
As is my name so is my love,
sweet Susan unto thee:
True is my name, true is my love,
and ever so shall be.
My love is loyal just and good,
kill me not with disdain,
Rather do me that courtesy,
to love for love again.
When she had read and understood,
his mind and his intent,
She then began to like and love,
and yield him hearts content,
John I am thine, if thou be mine,
for ever and for aye,
It was to prove thy constancy,
that I did say thee nay.
But here is my hand, my heart and love
I Will nere thee more deny,
My love is constant firm and true,
and shall be till I dye.
Then they embraced each others love,
and joyed in heart and voice,
That he of her, and she of him,
had made so sweet a choice.
But fortune which does often frown
where she before did smile,
The man's delight and maidens joy,
full soon she did beguile.
The second Part, to the same tune.
WHen she was settled in her love,
then he would change his mind,
And for to try her constancy,
would be to her unkind.
And thus resolved in his mind,
he would come to her no more,
But went and wood another maid,
which grieved her heart full sore.
(Quoth he) she proved unto me,
hard-hearted and unkind,
But now her true love I have won,
I Will bear the self same mind.
When she perceived his love to her,
not as 'twas wont to be,
She did lament, sigh, weep and grieve
and then these words spoke she.
False-hearted man adue, quoth she,
disloyal and unkind,
And if I dye for love of thee,
thou shall not know my mind.
Woe to the time I did believe,
that flattering look of thine,
Would God that I had never seen,
the tears of thy false eyne.
Hard hap had I to set my love,
on one that mocked me,
Sure all the country does not yield,
a man so false as he.
Thus was she brought to weak estate
all comforts from her fled,
She did desire to speak with him.
before that she was dead.
Her friends did seek to cheer her heart
and to make glad her mind,
But she was killed with loving him,
that proved to her unkind.
False-hearted man, may never maid
love thee as I have done,
But may my death remembered be,
to time that is to come.
And may all maids example take,
by this my mournful death,
And now sweet Lord receive my soul
to thee I yield my breath.
Thus died the pattern of true love,
thus died a virtuous maid,
Thus died as good a harmless Less
as ever Love betrayed.
Sir maids in white as custom is,
did bring her to the grave,
Her parents grieve, lament and mourn,
no child at all they have.
When as her Lover understood,
for truth that she was dead,
He raged, and ready was to tear
his hair from off his head.
But when he came into the town,
whereas his true Love lay,
He straightway ran unto her grave,
and these words there did say.
Susan (quoth he) I Will kiss thy grave,
upon my bended knee,
Whereby I Will show to all the world,
how dear I loved thee.
And as he lay upon the grave,
he heard a voice to say,
John True if ere thou lou'dst me dear,
make have and come away.
Then started he up from the grave,
and stood like one struck dumb,
But when he had regained his speech,
he cried, I come, I come.
And thus like one out of his wits,
he raged in piteous sort,
That all the neighbors presently,
were grieved at this report.
And thus with sorrow and grief of heart,
he lay a whole fortnight:
But when he had confessed his fault,
he yielded up his spright.
According to his hearts desire,
and as he did request,
They dig'd his grave, and laid him down
by her whom he loved best.
You young men all that have true loves
prove true unto your friend,
And if you love, be sure your love
be true unto the end.
And thus I end my story true,
so full of grief and woe.
May never any seek again,
to wrong each other so.
FINIS.
