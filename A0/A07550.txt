BEDLAM SCHOOLMAN. Or, Some Lines made by an English Noble Man, that was in
Bedlam. To its own pro^er Tune. Holow my Fancy, whither will thou go?
INTO a Melancholic Fancy,
Out of my self;
Into the Vulcan dancie,
All the World surveying,
No where staying,
Just like a Fairie Elff:
Out over the tops of highest Mountains Skipping,
Out over the Hills, the Trees, and Valleys tripping,
Out over the Ocean Seas, without an Oar or Shipping:
Holow my Fancy, whither will thou go?
Amidst the misty Vapors,
fain would I know,
What does cause the Tapours?
Why the Clouds benight us?
And afright us;
while we travel here below?
Fain would I know what makes the roaring Thunder?
And what these lightnings be, that rent the clouds asunder?
And what these Comets are, on which we gaze and wonder?
Holow my Fancy, etc.
Fain would I know the reason,
why the little Aunt,
All the Summer season,
Lays up provision,
Upon condition,
to know no Winters want?
And how these Huse-wives that are so good and painful,
Do unto their Husbands prove so good and gainful?
And why these lazy Drons, to them do prove disdainful?
Holow, etc.
Ships, Ships, I will discrie you,
amidst the Main;
I will come and try you,
What you are protecting.
And projecting,
what is your end and aim?
One goes abroad for Merchandise and Trading,
Another stays to keep his Country from invading,
A Third is coming home with rich and wealth of loading.
Holow, etc.
When I look before me,
there I do behold,
There`s none that sees or knows me;
All the World`s a gadding,
Running and madding,
none does his station hold:
He that is below invieth him that rises,
And he that is above, him that's below despises,
So every Man his plot and counter-plot devises.
Holow, etc.
Look, Look, what a busling,
here I do espy;
Each one another jusling,
Every one turmoiling,
One another spoiling*
as I did pass them by:
One sits musing in a dumpish Passion,
Another hangs his Head, because he is out of fashion,
A Third is fully bent on sport and recreation:
Holow, etc.
Amidst the foamie Ocean,
fain would I know,
What does cause the motion,
And returning,
In its journeying?
and does so seldom swerve?
And how these little Fishes, that swime beneath Salt water
Do never blind their Eye? Me thinks it is a matter,
An inch above the reach of Err^ Paterpunc;
Holow, etc.
Fain would I be resolved,
how things are done?
And where the Bull was calved,
Of bloody Falaris?
And where the Tailor is,
that works to the Man in the Moon?
Fain would I know how Cupid aims so rightly*
And how these little Fairies do dance and leap so lightly?
And where fair Cynthia makes her ambles nightly?
Holow, etc.
In conceit like Phaeton,
I`ll mount Phoebus Chair!
Having ne`re a Hat on,
All my Hair`s a burning,
In my journeying,
hurrying through the Air!
Fain would I hear his fiery Horses neighing!
And see how they on foamy Bitts are playing!
All the Stars and Planets I will be surveying!
Holow, etc.
O from what ground of Nature,
Does the Pellean,
That self devouting creature,
Prove so froward,
And untoward,
her Vitals for to strain!
And why the subtle Fox, while in deaths wounds is lying,
Does not lament his pangs, by howling and by crying?
And why the milk white Swan does sing when she`s a dying.
Holow, etc.
Fain would I conclude this,
at least make an essay,
What similitude is,
Why Fowls of a feather,
Do flock and fly together?
and Lambs know Beasts of prey?
How Natures Alchymists, these small laborious creatures,
Acknowledge still a Prince in ordering their matter,
And suffers none to live, who slothing lose their Fe^^^res?
Holow, etc.
I Am rapt with admiration,
when I do ruminate,
Men of one Occupation,
How each one calls him Brother,
Yet each invieth other,
and yet still intimate;
Yea, I admire to see, some Natives farther sundred,
Then Antipodes to us, is it not to be wondered,
In Myriads ye'll find of one Mind scarce an hundred!
Holow, etc.
What multitude of notions
does perturb my Pate,
Considering the motions,
How Heavens they are preserved*
And this World served,
in Moisture, Light and Heat!
If one Spirit sits the outmost Circle turning,
Or if one turns another continuing in jo^rneying?
If Rapids circles motion be that which they call burning.
Holow, etc.
Fain also would I prove this,
by considering,
What that which you call love is?
Whither it be a Folly,
Or a Melancholy,
or some Heroic thing!
Fain would I have it proved, by one whom Love has wounded
And fully upon one their desire has founded,
That nothing else could please them tho the World were rounded!
Holow, etc.
To know this Worlds Center,
Height, Depth, Breadth, and Length,
Fain would I adventure,
To search the hid attractions,
Of Magnetic actions,
And Adamantick strength!
Fain would I know if in some lofty Mountain,
Where the Moon sojourns, if there be Trees or Fountain?
If there be Beasts of prey? or yet be fields to hunt in?
Holow, etc.
Fain would I have it tried,
by Experiments,
By none can be denied;
If in this bulk of Nature,
There be voids less or greater,
or all remains complete?
Fain would I know if Beasts have any Reason?
If Falcons killing Eagles, do commit a treason?
If fear of Winters want, makes Swallows fly the season?
Holow, etc.
Holow my Fancy, holow,
stay thou at home with me,
I can thee no longer follow,
Thou have betrayed me,
And bewrayed me;
it is too much for thee.
Stay, stay at home with me, leave off thy lofty soaring,
Stay thou at home with me, and on thy books be poring:
For he that goes abroad lays little up in storing:
thou`s welcome home my Fancy, welcome home to me*
FINIS.
