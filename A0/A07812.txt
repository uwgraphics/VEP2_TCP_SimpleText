VTRIVSQVE ACADEMIAE CANTABRIG. and OXON. Praeclaris Luminibus ac Ornamentis;
coeterisque Sacrae Theologiae candidatis, and sincerioris Literaturae Studiosis
Gratiam and salutem in CHRISTO IESV.
SIquanto amoris studio Vtramque Academiam persequor, tanto Honoris testimonio
adornare eas possem (Viri Clarissimi) certe quidem hoc qualecunque Opus meum,
vestro praesertim nomini inscriptum, usque adeo excellens and singular
fuisset, ut nec ad conciliandam gratiam Cujusquam, nec ad veniam deprecandam
Praefatione aliqua indigeret. In quo tamen si quaeforte vobis occurrant (ut
sunt sane plurima) nullo hactenus, ex nostris partibus, Authore praevio, in
medium prolata; vestrae perspicacitatis erit, quanti momenti illa fuerint,
dijudicare: quorum duntaxat Apices aliquot saltem attingere operaepretium esse
duxi.

Sacramento Eucharistiae Resp. Christiana nihil unquam sublimius, nihil
sanctius habuit atque Augustius, quo Christiani quodammodo in Christum ipsum
transformamur. Hujus Institutionem in frontispicio libri, ex aliorum placitis,
MISSAM appello: quam vocem aliquis fortassis omissam nimis velit. Quin estotu
bono animo, quisquis es pius zelotes, and Papisticae Missae exosor vehemens.
Etenim nomen [Missa] secum omen suum apportat, quod cum a Dimittendis ijs, qui
Eucharistiae participes esse nolunt, ortum suum traxit, Romanam Missam plane
ingulat, quae (veluti Amasios suos) Spectatores meros omnibus lenocinijs ad se
allicit atque invitat; ac si in illo uno Theatrico spectaculo Religio ipsa
Christiana fere tota consisteret: quos tamen Antiquitas Catholica, apud Graecos
(...), apud Latinos Discedere iussit; and in persistentes, ut in homines
praefractos and impudentes, graviter acerbeque invecta est. Haec de Operis
Titulo praefari mihi libuit, ne in isthoc vocabulo Missae, veluti in ipso
vestibulo, impegisse videar.

Ex part Operis prima, quam Practicam dicimus, constat Institutionis Christi
Canones december, per Tridentinos Canones, in Romana Missa perfringi jugiter and
violari; sed maiori ne impudentia, an impietate difficile est dicere: nam in
Depravationibus istis patrocinandis mill annorum Consuetudini universali
anteponunt sequioris aetatis Diutissime, scilicet, retentam (ut aiunt)
trecentorum annorum modernae Ecclesiae Romanae (en!) sapientioris usum
contrarium. Deinde Praeceptum praximque Apostolicam a Pontifice Romans Abrogari
posse garriunt: quin and adversus Exemplum Christi, multis retro seculis vel ab
ipsis Romans Pontificibus sancte religioseque observatum, obtendunt Consuetudinem
contrariam habendam esse pro lege: hoc parum est, quia, quamvis de contrario
Praecepto Christi constaret, nihilominus Ius ipsum divinum a Pontifice Romano
relaxari posse, Iesuita blasphemo ore pronunciat.

Sequitur pars altera, quam Dogmaticam nominamus, in multa Membra se
diffundens, ita tamen ut horum verborum Christi [HOC EST CORPUS MEVM, etc.]
Expositioni literali Mysterij Romani de Eucharistia moles tota nitatur.
Quanquam dum in istis explicandis Adversarij nostri, Tridentinorum Patrum
spiritu afflati, Tropum omnem ab eisdem long exulare iubent; ipsi tamen (quae
est vertigo mera) Tropos sex, velint nolint, coguntur agnoscere. Porro in una
particula [HOC] totius Controversiae cardo vertitur: de qua cum quaeritur, quid
ea proprie designet, Pontificij Doctores in duas, easque contrarias, Opiniones
distrahuntur. Alij enim per, Hoc, Christi corpus denotari volunt; alij ad aliud
(quod ipsi commenti sunt) Individuum Vagum Pronomen illud referunt: ita ut
utrique, Andabatarum more, a se invicem vapulent, dum hi priorem sententiam
prorsus Absurdam, illi posteriorem Absurditatum plenam non dicunt modo, verum
etiam solidis Argumentis evincunt. Iam igitur, hoc uno fundamento ipsorum
Pontificiorum Contradictionibus (ut olim Turris Babel) diruto atque dejecto,
alia de Transsubstantiatione, de Corporali Christi Praesentia, Coniunctioneque
cum corporibus Communicantium, de proprie dicto Sacrificio, and de divina
denique Adoratione, superstructa portentosa Dogmata omnia corruere, and
labefactari necesse est. De singulis, si placet, pauca delibemus.

Primo in loco Trans^ubstantiationis non Dogma modo, sed and vox ipsa (multo
aliter quam pisces) novitate sua foetent. Ecquid habent, quod opponant?
nonnihil, nempe, Patres antiqui (inquiunt) de Conversione hujus Sacramenti
verba facientes, Transformationis, Transitionis, Transmutationis,
Transelementationis vocabula frequenter usurparunt: unde ipsissimam suam
Transsubstantiationem dilucide probarigens Romana clamitat and vociferatur. Cum
tamen Adversarios nostros minime lateat, eosdem Sanctos Patres parilibertate
sermonis iudicijque synceritate easdem voces singulas ad alias conversiones
transtulisse, ut (exempli gratia) nunc Verbi praedicati in Auditorem, nunc
Corporis Christi in Ecclesiam, nunc hominis Christiani in Christu^, nu^c
denique Corporum Christianorum in ipsam Christi carnem. Vnde sequitur, qua
ratione praeclari isti Disputatores unam duntaxat Transsubstantiationem
astruere conantur, eadem ex ipsa lege Parium (o homines misere fascinatos,
aliosque miserrime fascinantes!) quatuor alias tenentur admittere.

In Membro tertio partis Dogmaticae quaestio de Corporali praesentia Christi in
Eucharistia agitatur; quaeque huc pertinent omnia ad hoc unum Caput reducuntur;
Quid sit illud, quod, iuxta Christi institutionem, iam dicitur [Corpus meum?]
Hoc Catholica Ecclesia per multa secula ab Apostolicis usque temporibus nullum
aliud esse credidit, quam quod a B. Virgin natum, unum, uno in loco Definitum,
seu circumscriptum, Organicum quoque, and demum Sensuum omnium absolutissima
integritate juxta and Gloriae perfectione cumulatissima praeditum. At quod
Romanenses Carbonarijs suis Discipulis obtrudunt, Deus bone! quale Corpus, and
quam minime illud MEVM? Primo (id enim natura Transsubstantiationis necessario
exigit) Corpus, quale Pistores pinsunt, ex pane confectum; mox Corpus (namque
hoc discontinuitas locorum per se postulat) multiplex, quale Geryonis illud
fuisse fingitur: post, Corpus, (quia non definitive in loco) quale esse nullum
potest, Infinitum: dein Corpus, (quia totum in qualibet part loci) quale quis
vix somniare potest, Paraphysicum: insuper Corpus (ut ipsi aiunt) omni movendi,
sentiendi, intelligendique facultate destitutum, id est, coecum, surdum,
exanime: Corpus denique nullis non sordibus cuiusvis sterquilinij, and locorum,
quae honest nominari non possunt, inhonestissimorum obnoxium. Qualia Opinionum
portenta, ut omnino Haeretica, veteres Patres semper execrati sunt.

Verum enimvero diversarum aetatum subrancidas, Historias, si numeremus,
Tredecim proferunt, in quibus memoria de verissimae carnis, verissimique
sanguinis Christi in Eucharistia Apparentia verissima Lectoribus commendatur.
In quibus Miraculis, tanquam in Dei testimonijs omni exceptione majoribus
Adversarij nostri mirifice gloriantur; and dici vix potest quantopere miseros
mortales hac una Persuasione sua dementarunt: cum tamen haec verissima,
scilicet, si ponderentur, vanissima esse singula apparebunt. In quem finem
bonis illis Historicis valedicentes, recta Scholas petimus, exploraturi an
Scholastici eandem insanirent insaniam. Hi tantum abest ut istis Legendarijs
fidem assensionemve praebeant, ut in eiusmodi Apparitionibus vel veram carnem
Christi, vel omnino veram carnem inesse ausint non pernegare modo, verum-etiam
contrariam hanc suam sententiam exquisitis rationibus defendere. Quanquam quid
horum probatione opus est? quandoquidem nemofere est tam muccosis naribus (modo
non sensus suos prorsus obstruat) cui non suboleat, imo qui non eas legendo
plane odoretur, and persentiscat has fabulas a maleferiatis hominibus aniliter
esse confictas.

Quarto, In Corporali sua (ut vocant) Christi conjunctione cum Corporibus
Communicantium nihil aliud cernere licet quam Capernaiticam quandam
stupiditatem; quoties Pontificios audimus antiquas suas canere Cantilenas: se
nimirum Dentibus terere, gutturibus deglutire, hoc est, ut nos quidem
interpretamur, vere devorare; atque insuper hominum visceribus permiscere; imo
tam canum, muriumque, nec non vilissimi cujusque animalis intestinis, quam
vllius etiam sanctissimi viri, qui illius particeps esse potest. Quis deinceps
miretur fuisse olim qui Philosophos se dicerent, qui asserebant, Nivem sibi
atram videri, Coelum consistere, and Terram motione sua eaque perpetua rotari?

Hosce scopulos praetervecti, in Contentionum labyrinthum dilabimur, de
Sacrificio Missae, tot Amphibologijs and verborum involucris, tot Opinionum
Antilogijs, ceu viarum anfractibus, and sinuosi Maeandris undique implicitam,
ut absque commoda aliqua Distinctione difficiles, imo impossibiles habeat
explicatus; eoque magis, quod apud veteres Patres (ut quod res est libere
fateamur) de Sacrificio Corporis Christi in Eucharistia Incruento frequens est
mentio. quae dici vix potest quantopere quorundam, alioqui Doctorum hominum,
ingenia exercuerint, torserint, vexaverint; aut econtra quam jactanter
Pontificiy de ea re se ostentent: cum tamen hic nodus uno hoc Distinctionis
quasi cuneo facile discindatur. Corpus Christi dupliciter sumitur, velut
Subjectum Celebrationis Eucharisticae, velut Objectum ejus. Si Subjective
accipiatur pro eo, cui externa Accidentia insunt, tum non potest non Corporalem
Praesentiam Christi designare: sin vero Objective tantum, habita Relatione ad
Christi corpus, vel ut olim in cruce pendentis, vel ut nunc in Coelo regnantis,
Praesentiam duntaxat Symbolicam declarat; quoniam Objectum, licet rei cruentae,
ut in Scaena, ipsum est tamen Incruentum. Id quod sex Argumenta, ex veterum
Patrum testimonijs deprompta, dilucide demonstrant. Eadem igitur Distinctione
quivis poterit ita prorsus (...), ut non habeant quod contra mussitent. Quid?
quod praeterea etiam Romana Missa Grandis Sacrilegij rea arguitur.

Ad extremum, extremae and nefandae Idolomaniae Romans (...) ipsum, quae est
Sacramenti Eucharistiae divina Adoratio, in medium protrahitur; ubi id, quod
adorant, Posse esse adhuc Panem, propter fere infinitos Defectus, ipsi
Adversarij ultro concedunt: and Nos, Non posse illud non panem esse, juxta
Veterum sententiam, ex Rationibus circiter sexdecim evicimus: atque etiam quas
Adorandi Formulas, ceu Pretextus, excusationis ergo, sibi tanquam larvas
induxerunt, illis detraximus, ut vultus eorum deformes horridique appareant;
usque eo ut illi Idololatrica impietate Ethnicos aequare, Excusationis vero
futilitate long superare videantur. Quid tandem? tota fere Missae defensio
Manicheorum, Eunomianorum, Marcionitarum, Eutychianorum, aliorumque multorum
Haerefibus scatet passim, ut in postrema nostra Synopsi, veluti in speculo,
contemplari quivis possit. Dum ista literis consigno, ostensae sunt mibi, inter
alias, Theses duae, quas Isaacus Casaubonus* (...) in Adversarijs suis, propria
manu scriptis, post se reliquit. Prima, Iusta Causa est (inquit) cur
Transsubstantiatio rejiciatur, ut evitentur Absurda. Altera haec est; Veteres
nunquam dixerunt destrui Symbola, sed semper de Signis locuti sunt, quasi de re
ipsa. Quae quam verae sunt, and juxta Veterum sententiam ad Causam nostram
oppido necessariae, nostri muneris erit suo loco copiose ostendere. Priusquam
vero perorare mihi liceat, vos orandi estis (Viri ornatissimi) ut de
Adversariorum nostrorum Iniquitate, de meoque erga vos studio ac Benevolentia
nonnihil attexam.

Bellarmino, Alano, Maldonato, alijsque Romanae Missae Asserioribus suum, ut
par est, ingenij acumen, exactum and perspicax ingenium, omnium de^que tam
humanae quam divinae literaturae accuratam cognitionem facite tribuimus; ita
tamen vt in ijs, dum nostros Theologos criminantur, veritatem; dum suas
opiniones defendunt, constantiam; dum Patres, Patres crepant, obiectant,
inculcant, fidem modestiamque defideremus. Vt nihil de Eorum Iuramentis
dicamus, quibus se obstrinxerunt, non sine aliqua nota Periurij; quod Synopsis
nostra Secunda satis superque declarat.

Ad nostram quod attinet Sacratissima^ Eucharistiam; quia a Ministro Elementa
consecrantur and benedicuntur, non minus Sacramenta sunt, quam est aqua
Baptismatis; quae tamen Istis non pudet probris suis contaminare, dum partem
alteram merum Pistoris panem, alteram Oenopolae vinu^ nudu^ appellant nequiter.
Deinde (ut alias eoru^ Calumnias praetervolem) quod eorum de Corporali Christi
Praesentia in Eucharistia fanaticam opinionem, tanquam impossibilem, propter
implicitam Contradictionem, oppugnamus; Illi, quasi hoc esset Dei omnipotentiae
detrahere, in nos impotenter debacchantur. Si cui lubeat singulas Operis huius
Sectiones percurrere, vix in aliquam incidet aut Obiectionem Adversariorum
prosua Missa, aut Responsionem, aut denique Scripturae expositionem quam non
facile observet ab alijs Pontificijs Doctoribus aut luculenta ratione solutam,
enervatam, explosam; aut denique (quod maius est) per receptas Ecclesiae
Romanae doctrinas oppugnatam. Nae illa praeclara est istorum hominum
constantia, qui si minus viribus nostris, sua tamen imbecillitate and
dissentione vincuntur, atque succumbunt.

Praeterea de Pontificiorum Doctorum versutia obstinaciaque satis queri vix
possumus. Versutia eorum cernitur cum in rebus alijs, tum praecipue in
abutendis veterum Patrum Testimoniis, sive per falsas Editiones
Translationesque ea depravando; sive novo excogitato Commento illudendo; sieve
denique adversis frontibus oppugnando: quorum omnium Exempla plurima Libri
singuli sequentes vobis exhibent. Obstinaciae vero eorum specimen nullum potest
esse illustrius, quam (quod in altera Synopsi nostra videre est) ex Veterum
sententijs facta Collatione Eucharistiae cum Baptismate. Illi ad sua Dogmata
stabilienda de Praesentia Corporali Corporis Christi in Eucharistia, ipsiusque
adeo Adoratione Latreutica obijciunt Nobis, Patres negasse Eucharistiam esse
nudum Panem. Nos reponimus, eosdem Patres pariter negasse, in Baptismate esse
Aquam nudam. At opponunt, Veteres Eucharistiam Sacrificium vocasse. Nos rursus,
Baptisma quoque Sacrificium nominant. Illi, At apud Patres Eucharistia
Sacramentum Terribile and Venerabile dicitur. Regerimus nos, a Patribus moneri
homines ad Baptisma, utpote quod venerandum sit, cum Tremore accedere. Pergimus
dein, and per sexdecim (...) par pari referimus, quod Adversariorum nostrorum,
nisi animos obsirment, Conscientias mordeat and lancinet; sed manu tamen
medica, ut sanet. Eant igitur Antagonistae nostri, and cum de Antiquitate
agitur nos (ut solent) Novatores appellitent, nunquam tamen efficiet, quin ipsi
(ut praeclare olim Clariss. vir Josephus Scaliger) Veteratores habeantur.

Redeo ad Vos tandem (dignissimi Viri) quorum intimos animorum conceptus audire
mihi videor: quibus, quoad possim, and liceat, occurrendu esse^ duxi. Prim in
loco, Fateor equidem me iamdiu in is it usmodi Polemicis negotijs exercuisse
calamum; non quod nesciverim a Detractione neminem esse immunem, nisi qui nihil
scriberet: sed quod abunde noverim pro salute Patriae, proque patria salutis,
atque adeo pro fidei synceritate nullum non laborem esse subeundum. Secundo
multos alios multo majore cum profectu munere hoc defungi posse agnosco:
veruntamen, quatenus praestare quicquam valeam, illud S. Augustini aures mihi
vellicat, animumque stimulat: Qui mendacium docet (inquit) and qui veritatem
tacet, uterque reus est; alter qui^ prodesse non vult, alter quia nocere
desiderat. Nec profecto hanc Romulei stabuli (cum purgandi non datur)
exagitandi provinciam, in re Missatica, alio animo suscepi, quam ut omnes
(quibus veritas cordi est) intelligant, Nos Anglicanae Ecclesiae Alumnos Causam
nactos esse Divinis literis consentientem maxim, Catholicae Antiquitatis
suffragijs comprobatam, mill omnis ordinis Martyrum sanguine testatam; imo
etiam (addendum est enim) cuiusvis Christiani, si fieri posset, vel mill
mortibus obsignandam. Praeterea, Romanae Ecclesiae Tyrunculis omissis,
Antesignanos ipsos libentius aggredior, duplici ratione adductus; quia primo,
his profligatis, illi non possunt consistere: deinde ut clarius constet, in
illam Ecclesiam quadrare illud Christi; Si lumen, quod in te, tenebrae, ipsae
tenebrae quantae? Quos tamen, dum Argumentis prosequor, non probris insector;
quia in hoc altero Certaminis genere vincere vinci est: nam praeclare olim
Artaxerxes Rex militi, hostem convitijs proscindenti, Non ut maledicas te alo,
(inquit) sed ut pugnes.

Cur vero vobis potissimum has meas Lucubrationes dedicarem, plurimae me Causae
impulerunt. Antiquitus plurimi dicebantur Episcopi Catholicae sive Vniversalis
Ecclesiae, non solum quod Catholicam tenerent fidem, sed etiam quod suam pro
incolumitate Ecclesiae Vniversalis curam Scriptis and laboribus testarentur.
Egone igitur ut non illud studium erga utramque Vniversitatem profitear meum,
quod ipsi (ut ita dicam) Vniversalitati debeam? Huc accedit (nam quidni fidorum
Amicorum literis fidem habeam?) quod cum vos Opus nostrum aliud, tribus abhinc
annis publici iuris factum, non vulgari animorum vestrorum significatione
approbasse intellexerim; hocque, quod nunc ad umbilicu^ perduxi, non minori cum
desiderio expectasse (quorum illud GRANDEM ROMANAE ECCLESIAE IMPOSTVRAM
detexit, hoc ROMANAE MISSAE IDOLOMANIAM, tanquam immane monstrum, confodicat)
non committendum putavi, ut non grati animi meum hoc testimonium Vobis
referrem. Quid? quod Causae ipsius necessitas quoque id a me exigere videbatur,
quae profecto in hac Causa homines Academicos nihil minus quam Academicos and
Scepticos esse sinet; ne quis vestrum (quod detestabile omen Deus obruat!) in
Romans Artolatriam prolabatur, quo vel alijs scandalo, Majestati divinae odio,
sibi ipsi denique certo exitio esse possit.

Postremo, in hanc spem adducor, nunquam defuturos ex utraque Academia viros
plurimos, Theologici juris consultiss. omnibusque armis instructissimos, non
modo ad hujusce Causae patrocinium sustinendum, verumetiam ad Mataeologiam
omnem Romanensium expugnandam. Pergite igitur o macti antiqua prudentia and
veritate, pergite, inquam, and Amantissimum Vestri diligite; quod rectius
noveritis impertite, and precibus vestris adjuvate. In Christo Jesu valete, qui
vos conservet in gloriam Gratiae suae! AMEN.

An Advertisement
To all Romish Priests and Jesuits of the English Seminaries, concerning the
Necessity of this ensuing Treatise; as also of the Authors Sincerity, and his
Adversaries unconscionable Dealing in their Allegations of Authors.
Grace, Peace, and Truth in CHRIST JESUS.
AMong all the Controversies held against your Romish Religion, none were ever
more hot, to draw Protestants violently into the fire, than these two; first
the denying of your Roman Church to be The Catholic Church, without which
there is no Salvation: the second to affirm the Romish Adoration of the
Sacrament of the Altar to be Idolatrous. Therefore have I especially undertaken
the discussion of both these Questions, that seeing (as S. Augustine truly
said) It is not the punishment, but the Cause which makes a Martyr; it might
fully appear to the world, whether Protestants enduring that fiery trial,
for both Causes, were indeed Heretics, or true Martyrs: and consequently
whether their Persecutors were just Executioners of persons then condemned, and
not rather damnable Murderers of the faithful Servants of Christ. And I doubt
not but as the first has verified the Title of that Book, to prove your
Doctrine of the Necessity of salvation in your Romish Church to be a GRAND
IMPOSTVRE: So this second, which I now (according to my promise) present unto
you, will make good, by many Demonstrations, that your Romish MASS is a very
Mass, or rather a Gulf of many Superstitious, Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous
Positions and Practices.

And because the very name of Roman Church is commonly used as (in it self) a
powerful enchantment to stupifie every Romish Disciple, and to strike him
deaf and dumb at once, that he may may neither hear nor utter any thing in
Conference concerning the Mass, or any other Controversy in Religion, be the
Protestants Defense never so Divine for truth, or ancient for time, or
universal for Consent, or necessary for belief: I therefore held it
requisite, in the first place, to discover the falsehood of the former Article
of your Church, before I would publish the Abominations of the Mass; to the
end that (for Idolatry in Scripture is often termed spiritual Adultery) the
Romish Church, which plays the Bawd, in patronizing Idolatry, being once
outted, your Romish Mass, as the Strumpet, might the more easily either be
reformed, or wholly abandoned.

This may satisfy you for the necessity of this Tractate. The next must be to
set before you your own delusorie tricks, in answering, or not answering
Books written against you; especially such as have been observed from mine
own experience. One is to stangle a Book in the very birth: so dealt Mr.
Breereley long since by a letter writ unto me, to prevent the publishing of my
Answer against the first Edition of his Apology, when he sent me a second
Edition thereof to be answered, which both might and ought to have been sent a
twelvemonth sooner; but was purposely reserved to be delivered not until the
very day after my See the Protestants Appeal in the beginning.
Answer (called and Appeal) was published. Of which his prevention I have
therefore complained as of a most unconscionable Circumvention. Another device
you have, to give out that the Book (whatsoever) written against your Romish
Tenants is in answering, and that an Answer will come out shortly. So dealt
Mr. Parsons with me In his Sober Reckoning.
Certifying me and all his credulous Readers of an Epistle which he had
received from a Scottish Doctor, censuring my Latin Apologies to be both fond
and false; and promising that his Answer to them, Printed at Gratz in Austria,
should be published before the Michaelmas following: whereas there have been
above twenty. Michaelmasses sithence, every one giving Mr. Parsons his promise
the flatt lie. A third Art is a voluntary* Concealment and thus Master
Brereley, who having had knowledge of the forementioned Book of Appeal,
manifesting his manifold Aberrations and Absurdities in doctrine, his
ignorances and frauds in the abuse of his Authors, as in other passages
through-out that book, so more especially the parts concerning the Romish
Mass, yet since has written a large Book, in defense of the Romish Liturgy
or Mass, urging all the same proofs and Authorities of Fathers; but wisely
concealing that they had been confuted, and his fashoods discovered. Only he
and Master Fisher singling out of my Appeal an explanation which I gave of the
testimony of Gelasius (in condemning the Manichees, concerning their opinion
of not administering the Eucharist in both kinds) did both of them divulge it
in their Books and reports also in many parts of this kingdom, as making for
the justification of their sacrilegious dismembring the holy Sacrament, and
fora foul Contradiction unto my self: notwithstanding that this their
scurrilous iusultation (as is Book 1. c. 3.. 7.
here proved) serves for nothing rather than to make themselves ridiculous.
The last, but most base and deuellish, Gullerie is a false imputation of
Falsehoods in the alleging of Authors, which was the fine sleight of Master
Parsons; a man as subtile^ for invention, as elegant for expression, for
observation as dextrous and acute, and as politic and perswasiue for
application, as any of his time. He in an answer to some Treatises written
against your Romish black art of Aequiuocation by mental Reservation, and
other Positions fomenting Rebellion (to wit) in his books of Mitigation and
Sober Reckoning, does commonly leave the principal Objections and Reasons, and
falls to his verbal skirmishes, concerning false Allegations: and (as
turning that Ironicall counsel into earnest, Audacter and fortiter calumniare
etc.) he charge me with no less than fifty Falsifications. All which I
spunged out in a Book entitled an Encounter, and retorted all the same
Imputations of falsehood upon himself, with the interest of above forty more.
Which may seem to verify that Cognizance, which your own Brotherhood of
Romish Priests in their Quodlibets have fastened on his sleeue, calling him The
Quintessence of Coggerie.

As for mine own integrity, I have that which may justify me; for howsoever
any one or other Error may happen, in mis-alleaging any one Author, yet that I
have not erred much; or if at all, yet never against my Conscience. Hereof I
have many witnesses; One within me, a witness most Domestical, yet least
partial, and as good as Thousands, mine own Conscience: a second is above me,
God, who is Greater than the Conscience. A third sort of Witnesses are such as
stand by me, even all they who have been conversant with me in the perusal
and examination of Authors Testimonies, by me alleged; men of singular
learning and judgment, who can testify how much they endeared them-selves
unto me, when any of them happened to show me the least error in any thing.
(He that shall say, Non possum errare, must be no man; and he that will not
say, Nolo errare, as hating to err, can be no Christian man.) The last
witness for my integrity may be the Books of my greatest Adversaries, Mr.
Parsons, and Mr. Brereley, whose many scores of falsehoods have been laid so
open and published for above sixteen years past in two Books (one called an
Encounter against the foreman, the other an Appeal against the second) yet
has not any one appeared out of your Romish Seminaries for the vindicating of
them herein.

By these Advertisements you may easily conceive with what confidence I may
proceed in this work, wherein is displayed and laid open, in the discussing
of these Eight Words of Christ his Institution of the Blessed Sacrament of the
Eucharist, [HEE BLESSED; BRAKE; GAVE; TO THEM; SAYING; TAKE; EAT; DRINK,]
your Ten Romish Prevarications, and Transgressions. Afterward in the following
Books are reveiled the stupendous Paradoxes, Sacrilegiousnes, and Idolatry
of your MASS; together with the notorious Obstinacies, some few Overtures of
Periuries (out of that great Sum, which may afterward be manifested in your
swearing to the other Articles of your new Roman Faith) and the manifold
Heresies in the Defenders thereof: as also their indirect and sinister
Obiecting and Answering of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers thorow-out, as if
they contended neither from Conscience, nor for Conscience Sake.

To Conclude. Whosoever among you has been fascinated (according to your
Colliers Catechism) with that only Article of an Implicit Faith; let him be
admonished to submit to that Duty prescribed by the Spirit of God, to Try all
things, and to Hold that which is good. And if any have a purpose to Reioyne,
in Confutation either of the Book of the Romish Imposture, or of this, which
is against your Mass; I do adjure him in the name of Christ, whose truth we
seek, that avoiding all deceitful Collusions he proceed materially from Point
to point, and labor such an Answer, which he believes he may answer for
before the judgment seat of Christ. Our Lord Jesus preserve us to the glory
of his saving Grace. AMEN,

Tho: Coven: and Lichff.

The principal Heads of the Tractate following.
I. BOOK. Unfolds the Ten Transgressions of the Canon of our Lord Christ his
Institution, in the now Romish Mass. II. BOOK. Manifests the palpable
Falsehood of the Romish Exposition of Christ's words of Institution, [THIS IS MY
BODY.] III. BOOK. Discovers the Novelty and (indeed) Nullity of the Romish
Article of Transubstantiation: and proves the Continuance of the substance of
Bread, after Consecration. IV. BOOK. Reveileth the manifold Contradictions in
the Romish Defense of a Corporal Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament;
and consequently a necessary Impossibility thereof, without the impeachment of
the Omnipotency of God (yea with the advancement thereof:) Together with a
Discovery of the falsehood of their Thirteen Histories, relating so many
Apparitions of True Flesh, and true Blood of Christ in the Eucharist: As also
showing the Determination of the General Council of Nice upon the the point
of Corporal Presence. V. BOOK. Notes the threefold Capernaiticall Conceit
in the Romish (pretended) Corporal manner of Eating, Swallowing, and
g^t-receiving of Christ's flesh. VI. BOOK. Displayeth the manifold and gross
Sacrilegiousnes in the Romish Mass; upon their profession of a Proper and

CHAP. I.
That the Original of the word, MASS, nothing advantageth the Romish Mass.

SECT. I.
Diverse of your Romish Nomen antiquissimum, Missa, (quod quidem fides
Christiana profitetur) ex Hebraica vel Chaldaica nomenclatura acceptum esse
videtur, Missah, i. e. spontanea oblatio, conueniens instituto Sacrificio.

Doctors would have the word, MASS, first to be (in the first and primitive
Imposition and use thereof) Divine. Secondly, in time, more ancient than
Christ. Thirdly, in signification, most Religious, derived (as They say) from
the Hebrew word Missah, which signifies Oblation and Sacrifice; even the
highest homage that can be performed unto God. And all this to prove (if it may
be) that which you call THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS.

CHALLENGE.
SO have these your Doctors taught, notwithstanding many other Romanists, as
well Jesuits as others of principal Note in your Church, enquiring (as it
were) after the native Country, kindred, and age of the Word, MASS, do not
only say, but also prove, first, that It is no Hebrew-borne. Secondly, that
it is not of Primitive antiquity, because not read of before the days of S.
Ambrose, who lived about three hundred seventy three years after Christ.
Thirdly, that it is a plain Latin word, to wit Missa, signifying the
Dismission of the Congregation. Which Confessions being testified (in our

Multo probabilius esse Latinam; nam si vox Hebraica in vsu apud Apostolos

retinuerunt vocem Hosanna, Allelujah, Pascha, Sabbatum, and similes voces. --

is the same with (...) in the Greek Church: and with Ilicet amongst the
ancient Romans.] See the Testimony following.
Margin) by so large a consent of your own Doctors, proved by so clear
Evidence, and delivered by Authors of so eminent estimation in your own
Church; must not a little lessen the credit of your other Doctors (noted for
Neotericks) who have vainly labored, under the word MASS, falsely to impose
upon their Readers an opinion of your Romish Sacrificing Mass.

That the word, MASS, in the Primitive signification thereof, does properly
belong unto the Protestants: and justly condemns the Romish manner of Mass.

SECT. II.
THe word, MASS, (by the Missa a Missione dicta est, quoniam Catechumeni ^a

consueuerat, Ilicet, quod per Syncopen idem est ac, Ire licet. Sic nostrum

(See more hereafter, Chap. 2.. 5. where this point is discussed.) [As for the

an Ite, missa est, it was used in the second place, after the other. See Binius
aboue]
Confession of Jesuits and others, and that from the authority of Councels,
Fathers, Canon Law, Schoolmen, and all Latin Liturgies) is therefore so
called from the Latin phrase [Missa est] especially, because the company of
the Catechumenists, and those which were not prepared to communicate at the
celebrating of this Sacrament, after the hearing of the Gospel, or Sermons,
were Dismissed, and not suffered to stay, but commanded To depart. Which
furthermore your Ies. Maldonate, out of Isidore, the most ancient Authors, and
all the Liturgies, is compelled to confess to be the Alij, ut Isidorus de
divine. offic. dixerunt Missam appellatam esse quasi dimissionem, a dimittendis
Catechumenis antequam Sacrificium inchoaretur: qua^ sententiam colligo esse
verissimam ex antiquiss. Authoribus. -- Clamabat enim Diaconus post Co^cionem,
Catechumeni exeunto, et qui communicare non possunt: vt constat ex omnibus
Liturgijs, vbi non potest nomen Missae accipi pro Sacrificio. Maldon. Ies. lib.
dc 7 Sacram. Tract. de Euch.. Primum. p. 335.
Most true meaning of Antiquity.

Which Custom of exempting all such persons, being every where religiously
taught and observed in all Protestant Churches; and contrarily the greatest
devotion of your Worshippers, at this day, being exercised only in looking and
gazine upon the Priests manner of celebrating your Roman Mass, without
communicating thereof, contrary to the Institution of Christ; contrary to the
practice of Antiquity; and contrary to the proper use of the Sacrament: (All
which See Chap. 2. Sect. 9.
hereafter shall be plentifully showed) it must therefore follow, as follows.

CHALLENGE.
Whereas there is nothing more rife and frequent in your speeches, more
ordinary in your outhes, or more sacred in your common estimation, than the
name of the Mass; yet are you, by the signification of that very word,
convinced of a manifest Transgression of the Institution of Christ: and
therefore your great Boast of that name is to be judged false, and absurd. But
of this Transgression more See below, Chap. 2. Sect. 5.
hereafter.

The Name of CHRIST his MASS how far it is to be acknowledged by Protestants.

SECT. III.
THe Masters of your Romish Ceremonies, and others, naming the Institution of
Christ, Durand. Ration. lib. 4. c. 1. and Durant: de Ritib. l. 2. c. 3. So
Christoph. de Capit^ fontium Archiep. Caesar. var. Tract. de Christi Missa,
page 34. Liturgiae veteres parts Missae Christi exact respondent: -- Missa
Christi Ecclesiae Missam declarat.
call it his Mass. And how often do we hear your vulgar people talking of
Christ his Mass? Which word MASS (in the proper signification already
specified) could not possibly have been so distasteful unto us, if you had not
abused it to your fained, and (as you now see) false sense of your kind of
Proper Oblation and Sacrifice. Therefore was it a superfluous labor of Mr.
Liturg. Trac. 1.. 1.
Brereley, to spend so many lines in proving the Antiquity of the word, MASS.

CHALLENGE.
FOr otherwise We (according the aboue-confessed proper Sense thereof) shall,
together with other Protestants in the Confess. Aug. Cap. de Coena Domini.
Augustane Confession, approve and embrace it; and that to the just
Condemnation of your present Roman Church, which in her Mass does flatly and
peremptorily contradict the proper Signification thereof, according to the
Testimony of Micrologus, saying; Microl. de Eccl. obseruat. c. 1. Propter hoc
certe dicitur Missa, quoniam mittendi sunt for as, qui non participant
Sacrificio, vel communione Sancta. Test Cassand. Liturg fol 59.
The Mass is therefore so called, because they that communicate not, are
commanded to depart. By all which it is evident, that your Church has
forfeited the Title of Mass, which she has appropriated to her self as a
flagge of ostentation (whereof more See below. c. 2. sect. 9.
hereafter.) In the Interim, we shall desire each one of you to hearken to the
Exhortation of your own Waldensis, saying, Attend Missam Christi, etc.

Lu. 22 Accepto pane, etc. Durant. de ^iti. l. 2. c. 3 p. 211.
confession, begins at these words of the Gospel, concerning Christ's
Institution of the Eucharist, Math. 26. Luc. 22. [And Jesus took bread, etc.]
which also we do as absolutely profess.

What Circumstances, by joint consent on both sides, are to be exempted out of
this Canon of Christ his Mass; or the words of his Institution.

It is no less Christian wisdom and Charity to cut off unnecessary
Controversies, than it is a serpentine malice to engender them; and therefore
we exempt those points which are not included within this Canon of Christ,
beginning at these words; [And Jesus took bread, etc.] To know, that all
other circumstances, which at the Institution of Christ his Supper fell out
accidentally, or but occasionally (because of the then Jewish Passover, which
Christ was at that time to finish; or else by reason of the custom of Iudaea)
do not come within this our dispute touching Christ his Mass; whether it be
that they concern Place, (for it was instituted in a private house:) or Time,
(which was at night:) or Sex, (which were only men:) or Gesture, (which was a
kind of lying down:) or Vesture, (which was we know not what:) no nor yet
whether the Bread were unleavened, or the Wine mixed with water, two points
which (as you know) Protestants and your selves Antiquissimus decumbe^di usus

giant not to be of the essence of the Sacrament, but in their own nature
Indifferent; and only so far to be observed, as the Church, wherein the
Christian Communicants are, shall for Order and Decencie-sake prescribe the use
thereof.

The Points contained within the Canon of Christ his Mass, and appertaining to
our present Controversy, are of two kinds, viz. 1. Practical. 2. Doctrinall.

SECT. V.
Practical or Active is that part of the Canon, which concerns
Administration, Participation, and Receiving of the holy Sacrament, according
to this Tenor, Math. 26. 26. [And Jesus took Bread, and blessed it, and brake
it, and gave it to his Disciples, and said, Take, eat, etc. And Luc. 22. 19,
20. Do this in remembrance of me. Likewise also after Supper be took the
Cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this.]
But the points, which are especially to be called Doctrinall, are implied in
these words of the Evangelists; [This is my Body: And, This is my Blood of the
New Testament, which is shed for you, and for many for remission of sins.] We
begin with the Practical.

CHAP. II.
That all the proper Active and Practical points (to wit, of Blessing, Saying,
Giving, Taking, etc.) are strictly commanded by Christ in these words [DOE
THIS,] Luc. 22. Matthew. 26. and 1. Cor. 11.
SECT. I.
THere are but two outward material parts of this Sacrament, the one
concerning the element of Bread, the other touching the Cup. The Acts
concerning both, whether in Administering, or Participating thereof, are charged
by Christ his Canon upon the Church Catholic unto the ends of the World. The
Tenor of his Precept or command, for the first part, is [Doe this:] and
concerning the other likewise saying, 1. Cor. 11. 25. [This do ye as often,
etc.] Whereof your own Doctors, as well Jesuits as there is have rightly [Hoc

determined with a large consent; that the words [DOE THIS] have relation to
all the aforesaid Acts, even according to the i^dgement of ancient Fathers;
excepting only the Time of the Celebration, which was at Supper: and which
(together with us) [Coenan tibus autem illis.] and [Postquam coenanit.] Non
necesse est huiusmodi Sacramenti celebrationem aut coena praecedat, aut
consequatur, nam Christus ante coenauerat, non ut exemplum praeberet, fecit,
sed necessario, quia opo^tebat vetera Sacramenta prius implere, quam noua
instituere (id est) agnum paschalem prius edere, quam corpus and sanguinem su^m
dare. Agnus autem non alio tempore quam coenae edi poterat. Maldon. Ies. in
Mat. 26 super illa verba [Coenantibus autem.] etc.
you say were put in, not for example, but only by occasion of the Passover,
then commanded to be observed. Thus you.

CHALLENGE.
THis Command of Christ, being thus directly and copiously acknowledged by the
best Divines in the Roman Church, must needs challenge on both sides an
answerable performance. Upon examination whereof, it will appear unto every
Conscience of man, which Professors (namely, whether Protestants or Romanists)
are the true and Catholic Executors and Obseruers of the last will and
Testament of our Testator Jesus: because that Church must necessarily be
esteemed the more loyal and legitimate Spouse of Christ, which does more
precisely obey the Command of the celestial Bridegroom. We, to this
purpose, apply our selves to our business, by enquiring what are the Active
Particulars, which Christ has given in charge unto his Church by these his
express words [Doe this.] All which we are to discover and discuss from
point to point.

TEN TRANSGRESSIONS, And Preuarications against the Command of Christ [DOE
THIS,] practiced by the Church of Rome, at this day, in her Roman Mass.

SECT. II.
We list not to quarrel with your Church for lighter matters, albeit your
own Cassander forbeareth not to complain that your Has Panis Oblatas, quae
nunc ad imaginem nummorum, and ad tenuissimam and leuissimam forman a very
panis specie alienam redactae sunt, per contemptum (ab ordinis Romans Expositore)

Bread is of such extreme thinness and lightness, that it may seem unworthy
the name of Bread. Whereas Christ used Solid and tough bread [Glutinosus] says

Ies. in Act. 2. v. 42.. Indicat.
your Jesuit) which was to be broken with hands, or cut with knife.
Nevertheless, because there is in yours the substance of Bread, therefore we
will not contend about Accidents and shadows; but we insist upon the words of
his Institution.

The first Transgression of the (now) Church of Rome, in contradicting Christ
his Canon, is collected out of these words, [AND HE BLESSED IT;] which concern
the Consecration of this Sacrament.

SECT. III.
FIrst of the Bread the Text says [He blessed it:] next of the Cup it is said
[When he had given thanks:] Which words in Non dubium est quin apud
Euangelistas (...) idem sit quod (...): nam quod Matthaeus and Marcus dicunt

this Sacrament. So you.

has changed Christ's manner of Consecration.

The Canon of the Romish Mass attributes the property and power of
Consecration of this Sacrament only unto the repetition of these words of
Christ [This is my body,] and [This my blood.] etc. and that from the judgment

very words, pronounced with a Priestly intention, as to change all the Bread in
the Bakers shop, and wine in the Vintners Cellar into the body and blood of
Christ: As your Summa Angelica, tit. Eucharistia number. 25. de P^ne. Sacerdos

that the Consecration, used by our Savior, was performed by that his Blessing
by Prayer, which preceded the pronouncing of those words, [Hoc est corpus
meum:] [This is my body, etc.] To this purpose he is bold to aver that
Thomas Aquinas and all Catholics before Caietane have confessed that Christ
did consecrate in that his [Benedixit, that is, He blessed it.] And that Saint
James and Dionyse the Areopagite did not Consecrate only in the other words,
but by Prayer. Then he assures us that the Greek Churches maintained that
Consecration consists in Benediction, by Prayer, and not in the only
repetition of the words aforesaid. After this he produces your subtilest
Schooleman Scotus, accompanied with diverse others, Who Derided those, that
attributed such a supernatural virtue to the other form of words. After
steppeth in your Lindan, who avoucheth Justin (one of the ancientest of
Fathers) as Denying that the Apostles consecrated the Eucharist in those words,
[Hoc est, etc.] and affirming that Consecration could not be without Prayer.

Be you but pleased to peruse the Marginals, and you shall further find
alleged the Testimonies of Pope Gregory, Hierome, Ambrose, Bernard, and (to
ascend higher) the Liturgies of Clement, Basil, Chrysostom, and of the Roman
Church it self; in gainsaying of the Consecration, by the only words of
Institution, as you pretend. And in the end he draws in two Popes,
contradicting one the other in this point, and has no other means to stint
their jar, but (whereas the authority of both is equal) to think it just
to yield rather to the better learned of them both. Whosoever requires more,
may be satisfied by reading of the Book itself.

It will not suffice, to say, that you also use Prayer in the Romish Liturgy:
for the question is not merely of Praying, but wherein the form of
Benediction and Consecration properly does consist. Now none can say, that he
consecrateth by that Prayer, which he belieueth is not ordained for
Consecration. We may furthermore take hold, by the way, of the Testification of
Mr. Tract. of the Mass, page 105.
Brereley a Romish Priest, who out of Basil and Chrysostom, [calling one part
Calix benedictione sacratus] allows Benediction to have been the
Consecration thereof.

All this Army of Witnesses were no better than Meteors, or imaginary figures
of battles in the air, if that the Answer of Bellarmine may go for
warrant, to wit, that the only Pronuntiation of these words [Hoc est corpus
meum] imply in them (as he Verba haec [Hoc est corpus meum] pronuntiata a
Sacerdote, cum intention consecrandi Sacramentum, continent implicit
Invocationem. Bellar. lib. 4. de Euch. c. 14.. Quintu^ arg.
says) an Invocation, or Prayer. Which words (as any man may perceive) Christ
spoke not supplicatorily unto God, but declaratiuely unto his Apostles,
accordingly as the Text speaks, [Hee said unto them:] as is also well See the
former testimony, letter (g.)
observed by your foresaid Archbishop of Caesarea, out of Saint Hierome. But
none of you (we presume) will dare to say that Christ did Invocate his
Disciples. These words therefore are of Declaration, and not of Invocation.
Which (now) Romish Doctrine of Consecrating, by reciting these words [This is
my body, etc.] your Divines of Colen Vehemens prorsus insania est, quod nune
arbitrantur se consecrate hoc Sacramentum sine prece, quam Canonem appellamus,
absque invocatione super dona, sed tantum recitatione verborum, etc. Talis
recitatio non est Co^secratio. -- Aliter profecto erat in Ecclesia orientali,
and occidentali. -- Hactenus in Ecclesia doctum fuit, in piece, qua Sacerdos
sic invoca^ [Hanc Oblationem quaesumus, Domine, acceptabile facere dignetis,
etc. Antididag. de Cath. Relig. per Canon. Eccles. Coloniens. Tract. de Missa,
p. 100. An sine prece.
have judged to be a Fierce madness, as being repugnant both to the Eastern
and Western Churches. But we have heard diverse Western Authors speak, give
leave to an Eastern Archbishop to deliver his mind. Quod autem ille sermo
Domini sufficiat ad sanctificationem, nullus neque Apostolus, nec Doctor
dixisse cernitur. Nic. Cabasil. Explicat. Euch. c. 29. Latini obijciunt

illud dictum Dei [Crescite] nullo adhuc opus habemus adiumento, nulla prece,
nullo matrimonio? Ibid.
No Apostle, or Doctor is known to affirm (says he) those sole words of
Christ to have been sufficient for Consecration. So he, three hundred years
since, satisfying also the Testimony of Chrysostom, objected to the contrary.

As miserable, and more intolerable is the Answer of others, who See the
Testimony before at the letter (g) toward the end.
said that the Evangelists have not observed the right order of Christ his
actions: as if he had first said, [This is my bodie] by way of Consecration,
and after commanded them to [Take and eat.] Which Answer your own Alij
dixerunt, Christum his verbis semel dictis consec^asse, sed Evangelistas non
seruasse ordinem in rei gestae narratione. Sed cum omnes Evangelistae
conueniunt in hoc, ut dicant, primum Christum accepisse panem, deinde
Benedixisse, tertio fregisse, and tum de disse, dicendo [Hoc est corpus meum]
videntur non casu, sed consilio Evangelistae rem narrasse, ut gesta est.
Maldon. Jes. Disp. de Euch. q. 7. p. 133. [And among them that do invert the
order, is Alan. lib. (...). de Euch. c. 15. p. 295.] Alij docuerunt, Christum
haec verba [Hoc est corpus meum, etc.] bis repetivisse: quae sententia est
falsa, quia null^ conjectura probari potest. Idem ibidem.
Jesuit has branded with the note of Falsitie: yea, so false, that (as it is
further See above, lit. ((...).)
avouched) all ancient Liturgies, as well Greek as Latin, constantly held,
that in the order of the tenor of Christ his Institution it was first said
[Tak^ yee] before that he said [This is my Body.]

Lastly, your other lurking-hole is as shameful as the former, where, when the
judgment of Antiquity is objected against you, requiring that Consecration be
done directly by Prayer unto God: Justin. Apol. 2. docet, Oratione confici
Eucharistiam. Iren. lib. 4. c. 5. Invocatione nominis Dei. Cyril. Hier. Catech.
mystag. 3. and 4. Invocatione Spiritus Sancti. Hieron. Epist. ad Evag.
Sacerdotum precibus. August. Semperfere prece mystica (ut lib. 3. c. 4. de
Trin.) Sacramentum fieri asserit. -- Respondetur, Primo quod veteres non
curabant passim exact declarate and praecise quibus verbis conceptis
consecraretur: licet Ministris secretiore institutione ea tradidisse constat.
Alan. l. 1. de Euch. c. 17. p. 310. [To whom might be added Cyprian de coena
Domini, Calix benedictione sacratus.]
you answer that some Fathers did use such speeches in their Sermons to the
people, but in their secret instraction of Priests did teach otherwise. Which
Answer (besides the falsitie thereof) We take to be no better than a reproach
against Antiquity, and all one, as to say that those venerable Witnesses of
Truth would profess one thing in the Cellar, and proclaim the contrary on
the housetop. It were to be wished, that when you frame your Answers, to
direct other men's Consciences, you would first satisfy your own, especially
being occupied in soule's-businesses.

We conclude. Seeing that Form (as all learning teaches) gives being unto
all things; therefore your Church, albeit she use Prayer, yet erring in her
judgment concerning the perfect manner and Form of. Consecration of this
Sacrament, how shall she be credited in the Materials; wherein she will be
found, as well as in this, to have Transgressed the same Iniunction of Christ,
[DOE THIS?]

Nevertheless, this our Conclusion is not so be interpreted, as (hearken It
was M. Brereley his error, Liturg. p. 101. in alleging Irenaeus lib. 5. cap.
1. Quando mixtus calix, and fractus panis percepit verbu^ Dei, fit Eucharistia.
[Here by verbum Dei, is not meant the words of Hoc est, etc. but Prayer, and
the word of Blessing, commanded by the Word of Christ, who blessed it, and
commanded his Church, saying, Do this: as appears by Iraen. lib. 4. c. 34.
when he says, Panis percipiens vocationem (for Invocationem) Dei, non est
communis panis.] In the next place Ambrose. l. 4 c. 4 dc Sacr. Consecratio
igitur quibus verbis fit? Domini Jesus, etc. Ergo sermo Christi conficit hoc
Sacramentum, nempe is, quo facta sunt omnia, iussit, and factum est. [This is
the Allegation; whereas if he had taken but a little pains to have read the
Chapter following, be should have received Saint Ambrose his plain
Resolution; that they meant the words of Prayer. Visscire quibus verbis
coelestibus consecratur? Accipe verba, Dicit Sacerdos, Fac nobis hanc
Oblationem acceptam, etc. Then he procecdeth to the Repetition of the whole
Institution. We see then that the Latin Church had this form (Fac) even as
the Greek had their (...): both in Prayer, but neither of both without
reciting the form of Institution.]
Mr. Brereley) to exclude, out of the words of this Celebration, the Repetition
and pronunciation of these words [This is my Body: and, This is my Blood of
the new Testament.] Far be this from us, because we hold them to be
essentially belonging to the Narration of the Institution of Christ; and are
used in the Liturgy of our Church: for although they be not words of Blessing
and Consecration, (because not of Petition, but of Repetition) yet are they
Words of Direction; and, withal, Significations and Testifications of the
mystical effects thereof. Your Objection out of the Fathers is See at the
former letter (o.)
answered.

The second Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass, is in their
Contradicting the sense of the next words of. Institution, [HE BRAKE IT.]

SECT. IV.
HE brake it.] So all the Evangelists do relate. Which Act of Christ plainly
notes that he Brake the Bread, for distributing of the same unto his
Disciples. And his Command is manifest, in saying as well in behalf of this,
as of the rest, [Doe this.] Your Priest indeed Breaks one Host into three
parts upon the Consecration thereof: but our Question is of Fraction or
Breaking, for Distribution to the People.

The Contrary Canon of the (now) Roman Mass.

Ecce, in coena Christus fregit panem: and tamen Ecclesia Gatholica modo non
frangit, sed integrum dat. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34.. Nam. p. 275.
BEHOLD (say you) Christ brake it; but the Catholic Church (meaning the
Roman) now does not break it, but gives it whole. And this you pretend to
do for Reverence-sake, Lest (as your Amulto tempore non usupatur fractio, sed
singuli panes, seu minores hostiae consecrantur, ad evitandum periculum
decidentium micarum. Lorin. Ies. in Act. 2. 42. Bona ratione, ne micae aut
particulae panissacri pereant. Salmeron quo supra, aliquanto post.
Jesuit says) some crummes of Bread may fall to the ground. Neither is there
any Direction to your Priest to Break the Bread, either before or after
Consecration, in your Roman Mass; especially that which is distributed to the
people.

CHALLENGE.
But now see (we pray you) the absolute Confession of your own Fregit.]
Nimirum in tot particulas quot erant Apostoli manducaturi, praetersuam, quam
Christus primus accepit. Et (ut quidam non indiligenter annotavit) quemadmodum
unum calicem communem omnibus tradidit ad bibendu^, ita una palma panem in 12.

Sequitur p. 77. Apostolus Act. 2. Vocat Eucharistiam fractionem panis, ob

in qua fractione pulchre repraesentatur Passio corporis Christi. Idem Ies.
Tract. 35.. Vocat. page 288. [Infractione Panis, Act. 2.] Indicat fractionis

essentialibus omittentes. Vsus autem Ecclesiae and eius celebrandi ordo nos
docent, qualis fuit Christi Missa, and quo illam ordine celebravit* Archiep.
Caesar. var. Tract. page 27.
Doctors, whereby is witnessed, first, that Christ brake the bread into twelve
parts. Secondly, that this Act of breaking of bread is such a principal Act,
that the whole Celebration of this Sacrament has had from thence this
Appellation given to it, by the Apostles, to be called Breaking of Bread.
Thirdly, that the Church of Christ always observed the same Ceremony of
breaking the bread, as well in the Greek as in the Latin (and consequently the
Roman) Church. Fourthly, that this Breaking of the Bread is a Symbolicall
Ceremony betokening not only the crucifying of Christ's body upon the Cross,
but also (in the common participation thereof) representing the union of the
mystical body of Christ, which is his Church, Communicating together of one
loaf: that as many grains in one loaf, so all faithful Communicants are
united to one Head Christ, as the Apostle teaches, 1. Cor. 10. thus, [The
bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Christ? for we
being many are one bread.] We add, as a most special Reason, that this
Breaking it, in the distribution thereof, is to apply the representation of the
Body crucified, and the Blood shed to the heart and soul of every
Communicant; That as the Bread is given broken to us, so was Christ crucified
for us. Yet, nevertheless, your Church contrarily professing, that although
Christ did break bread, yet (BEHOLD!) she does not so; what is it else, but to
starch her face, and insolently to confront Christ his Command by her bold
Countermand (as you now see) in effect saying; But do not this.

A SECOND CHALLENGE.
AS for that truly called Catholic Church, you your-selves do grant unto us,
that by Christ his first Institution, by the Practice of the Apostles, by the
ancient and universal Custom of the whole Church of Christ, as well Greek as
Latin, the Ceremony of Breaking bread was continually observed. Which may be
unto us more than a probable Argument, that the now Church of Rome does falsely
usurp the Title of CATHOLIC, for the better countenancing and authorizing of
her novell Customs, although never so repugnant to the will of Christ, and
Custom of the truly called Catholic Church.

In the next place, to your Pretense of Not-Breaking, because of Reverence, We
say; Hem, scilicet, Quanti est sapere! As if Christ and his Apostles could not
foresee that your Necessity, (namely) that by the Distributing of the Bread,
and by Breaking it, some little crummes must cleave sometimes unto the beards
of the Communicants, or else fall to the ground. Or as though this Alteration
were to be called Reverence, and not rather Arrogance, in making your-selves
more wise than Christ, who instituted; or then all the Apostles, or Fathers of
primitive times, who continued the same Breaking of bread.

Therefore this your Contempt of Breaking what is it but a peremptory breach
of Christ his Institution, never regarding what the Scripture says; 1. Sam.
15. 22.
Obedience is better then Sacrifice. For, indeed, true Reverence is the mother
of Obedience; else is it not Devotion, but a mere derision of that Command of
Christ, [Doe this.]

The third Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass; contradicting
the sense of the next words of Christ's Command, viz. [ -- GAVE IT UNTO THEM.]

SECT. V.
IT follows in the Canon of Christ his Mass, [And he gave it unto them;]
even to THEM, to whom he said, [Take ye, eat ye.] By which plurality of
persons is excluded all private Massing; forasmuch as our High Priest Christ
Jesus (who in instituting and administering of this Sacrament would not be
alone) said hereof, as of the other Circumstances, [Doe this.]

The Contrary Canon of the (now) Roman Mass.

This holy Synod (says your Missas illas, in quibus solus Sacerdos
sacramentaliter co^municat -- probar atque adeo commendat. Council. Trid. Sess.
22. cap. 6.
Council of Trent) does approve and commend the Masses, wherein the Priest
does Sacramentally communicate alone. So your Church.

CHALLENGE.
But who shall justify that her Commendation of the alone-communicating of
your Priest? which we may justly condemn by the liberal Sunt qui in Missa

Legitimate Mass; do wonder how your Priests sole Communicating ever crept
into the Church; and also deplore the contempt, which your private Mass has
brought upon your Church. Hitherto (see the Marginals) from your own
Confessions.

Let us add the absurdity of the Commendation of your Council of Trent, in
saying, We commend the Priest's communicating alone. A man may indeed possibly
talk alone, fret alone, play the Traitor alone: but this Communicating alone,
without any other, is no better Grammar than to say that a man can confer
alone, conspire alone, contend, or Covenant alone. Calvin says indeed of
spiritual Eating, which may be without the Sacrament (as you also Qui dicunt
Christum manducari spiritualiter a fidelibus posse, etiamsi Sacramentaliter non
manducetur, atque eo cibo animam ali, vera quidem asserunt. Acosta Jes. de
procur. Indorum Salut. c. 7. p. 532.
confess) that a faithful man may feed alone of the Body and Blood of
Christ: But our dispute is of the Sacramental Communicating thereof. See above
at the letter (a)


A SECOND CHALLENGE
Against the former Prevarication, condemning this Roman Custom by the Roman
Mass it self.

We make bold yet again to condemn your Custom of Private Mass, and
consequently the Commendation given thereof by the Council of Trent. For by the
Canon of your own Mass, wherein there are Interlocutorie speeches between
Priest and People at the Celebration of this Sacrament, the Priest saying
[Dominus vobiscum: The Lord be with you;] and the People answering the Priest,
and saying [And with thy Spirit] your Cl. Espencaeus, sometimes a Parisian
Doctor (one commended by Claudij Espencaei Theologi Parisiensis Tractatus de
utraque Missa: quarum alteram publicam, alteram priuatam appe^lant. Opera
Gilberti Theologi Parisiensis. Genebrard.
Genebrard for his Treatise upon this same Subject of the Private Mass) albeit
he agrees with the execrable Execration and Anathema of the Council of Trent,
against them that hold Solitary Masses to be unlawful; yet after the expense
of much paper, to prove that some private Mass must needs have anciently
been, because Primitiuely Mass was celebrated almost in all Churches every
day; and that S. See below at the letter (p.)
Chrysostom did complain of the absence of the people: yet coming to
determine of the point, Haec and similia pro priuataru^ Missarum usu and
vetustate probabilia quidem sunt, sed minus aperta, nec n. qui oblatum dicunt
communicatum negant, etc. Espen. Tract. de vtraque Missa fol. 226. [where also
had been objected the complaint of Chrysostom, sc. fol. 222.]
This Reason (says he) is only probable, but not evident; for although they
affirm a daily celebration of the Mass, yet do they not deny a daily
Communion.

Afterward he seeks the Original and beginning of private Mass out of
private Monachos, plus alioqui iam satis grauatos invidia, primos prinatarum
Missarum Authors fuisse, quidam faciunt. Espenc. ibid. fol. 227. Non est quod
ex publicarum Missarum Monachis cum interdictione colligamus Privatarum ab eis
inventionem. Ib. fol. 228.
Monasteries: yet, not able to satisfy himself there, he comes at length to
debate a Controversy, wherewith many were then perplexed, to wit; how it could
be said by a Priest, being alone, [The Lord be with you;] or Answer be made
to, and by the said Priest, being then alone, [And with thy Spirit.]

To this end he propounds many Dominus vobiscum, etc. Quare salutatio non
Cleri modo sed and plebis fuit. Ex horum verborum occasion mota olim iam tanta
quaestio, qua non alia sit in hodiernis de religione controversijs grauior au^
magis agitata. -- Gratianus rospondet, pie credi, Angolorum in Missa

mysterium plena esse credatur Ecclesia. Thus far Espen. quo sup fol. 212, 213.

Answers, which I refer to your Choice; whether you will believe with
Gratian, that the words [Dominus vobiscum: The Lord be with you] spoken by the
Priest, being alone, may be thought to have been spoken to Angels: or, with
Cameracensis, unto Stones: or, with the Heremites in their Celles, unto forms
and Stools: or else, with the Deane of the Cardinals, teaching any Heremite
being alone, to say, [The Lord be with you] as spoken to himself. All which
imaginary fooleries are so unworthy the Conceptions of but reasonable men,
that we may fear to be held inconsiderate, if we should endeavor to confute
them. Only we can say no less, than that if the Apostle did condemn them, who
speak with strange languages in the public assembly (although they that
spoke understood themselves) because that in such a Case 1. Cor. 14. 23.
If (says he) there be none to interpret, and there come in an Ignorant or
Infidel observing this, will he not say, you are mad? how much more extreme
Madness must we judge this to be, where men either talk to themselves, or else
(as if they were metamorphosed into the things, whereunto they speak) unto
forms, stones, stools, and the like?

For Conclusion, hear the said Deane of the Roman Cardinals (from whom a
Sacerdos dicit [Pax omnibus vobis:] quoniam autem pro se invicem precari est
praeceptum Apostolicum, propterea populus quoque ei ipsam pacem precatur,
dicens, [Et cum spiritu tuo.] Nic. cabas. Archiep. Thessal. Ann. Dom. 1350.

Greek Archbishop shall not dissent) speak reason, and withal tell you that
the Correspondencie of speech used betwixt Priest and People, was to unite the
hearts of both Priest and People together. We say, with him, to unite them,
not (as you do) to separate People from Priest by your solitary Masses; and
yet to confound their speech by your [Dominus vobiscum.] And if this may not
prevail with you, yet me thinks the authority of Pope Gregory, surnamed the
Great, may command your belief. He upon the form of the Roman service, by an
interchangeable speech between Priest and People, concludes that Greg. Papa.
Sacerdos Missam solus nequaquam celebret; quia sicut illa celebrari non potest

celebrari, esse n. debent qui ei circumstent, quos ille salutet, ad reducendum
in memoriam illud Dominicum [Vbicunque sunt duo aut tres congregati.] Test
Cassandro Liturg. fol. 96.
Therefore the Priest should not celebrate Mass alone. And yet behold a
Greater Pope than he, even Soter, more ancient by 400. years, and also a
Martyr, Soter B. of Rome Ann. 170. [who suffered Martyrdom, made this Decree
for celebrating of Mass:] Vt nullus Presbyterorum praesumat, nisi duobus
praesentibus, and ipse tertius habeatur: quia cum pluraliter ibi dicitur
[Dominus vobiscum] and illud in secret is [Orate pro me] apertissime convenit,
ut ipsius respondeatur salutationi. Witness M. Harding Art. 1. Divis. 29. apud
Iuellum.
decreeing, as most convenient, (for Answer unto the Priest's Vobiscum, and
Orate) that there be two at least besides the Priest.

An One that of late writ to a Popish Lady, not discovering his name.
Anonymus, not long since, would needs persuade his Reader that by [Vobiscum]
was meant the Clerk of the Parish. But why was it then not said, Dominus
tecum, The Lord be with thee? O, this forsooth, was spoken to the Clerk in
civility, according to the ordinary Custom of intitling singular persons in
the plural number: and this Answer he called Saluing of a doubt.

But any may reply, that if it were good manners in the Priest to call upon
the Clerk with [Vobiscum] in the plural number for Civility-sake, it must
then be rusticitie in your Church, to teach your Clerk to answer your Priest
[Et cum Spiritu tuo: And with thy Spirit.] And again, the Answer is
impertinent, for where the Priest is found thus parling with the Clerk, he
cannot be said to be Alone. And so the Answer of this man must be indeed not
Saluing, but (as the rest of his manner of answering) a Quack-saluing rather,
and a mere Delusion.

A THIRD CHALLENGE Against the same Custom.

A Custom Commendable, say your Fathers of Trent; Condemnable, say we, even
from your own Consciences, because you were never hitherto able to produce
either any Commendable, yea or Tolerable example, expressly recorded within the
many Volumes of Antiquity, of any celebration of the Eucharist, without a
Communion; no, not in that only objected place of Chrysostom. in Ephesians. Hom. 3.
Frustra habetur quotidiana oblatio, frustra stamus ad altar, cum nemo est qui
participet. Ob. a Bellar. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 9. [Not that in these daily
Celebrations None at all did communicate with the Priest: for he was
accompanied, at least, with some Ecclesiastiques; as is employed in the words,
(Stamus ad Altar) And it is no rare Hyperbole in Chrysostom to use the word,
(...), for, a Paucitie.]
Chrysostom, whose Speech is not a Grant, that absolutely All were absent from
his administration of the Eucharist: but certainly it is a vehement Invective
against all wilful Absents. So far was he from allowing, much more from
Commending Communicating alone, who elsewhere, against such as neglected to
Communicate with the poor, taking his Argument from the example of Christ,
That Supper ( Chrysostom. Illa coena (Christi) communiter omnes accumbentes
habuit. Tom. 4. in illum locum Pauli; Oportet Haereses esse. 1. Cor. 11. 19.
says he) was common to All. The very Argument of Saint Hierome, saying (yet
more obligatorily) Hieron. Coena Domini dicitur, quia Dominus in coena tradidit
Sacramenta. Dominica coena debet omnibus esse communis. In 1. Cor. cap 11.
The Lord's Supper ought to be common to All. Such Reverencers were the
Primitive Fathers of the Ordinances of Christ. And as touching [For again, if
it should be strictly racked, so should he himself not have participated, and
then was it no Mass at all. But Chrysostom's Rhetorique, in Hyperbolizing, is
noted especially by your Senensis; as may be observed in Chrysostom's like
Invectiue against the carnal security of men, even in the word, Nemo: Nemo
divina sapit: nemo terrena contemnit: nemo ad coelum attendit. Hom. 12. ad Heb.
Now, None is so senseless as to think hereby that Chrysostom thought
himself absolutely to be wholly alone.]
[Nemo, No man] in the testimony of Chrysostom, it is known to be taken
restrainedly, for Few; and so [Frustra stamus, etc.] Ex quibus verbis apparet,
in his quotidianis Missis solos fere Ministros and Clericos, paucos vero
autnullos a populis communicasse. G. Cassander de Liturg. Chrysost^ [Yea and
Epenseus durst not rely upon this Testimony.
acknowledged by your selves in the place objected.

The fourth Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass,
contradicting the sense of the next words, [ -- SAID UNTO THEM.]

SECT. VI.
IN the aforesaid Canon of Christ his Mass it follows, [And he said unto
Them.] Christ Saying or speaking to his Disciples, by commanding them to Take,
etc. did, doubtless, so speak, that they might hear his Command; to wit, in
an audible voice. Which done, he further commanded, concerning this same
Circumstance, jointly with the rest, saying, [Doe this.]

The contrary Canon of the Roman Mass.

But your late Council of Si quis dixetit, Ecclesiae Rom ritum, quo submissa
voce pars Canonis, and verba Consecrationis proferuntur, damnandum esse,
Anathoma sit. Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. Can 9.
Trent pronounces him Anathema, who shall condemn her Custom of the Priest,
uttering the words of Consecration in a low voice. Whereby (says your Quibus
verbis Conc. verba Consecrationis alta voce proferri prohibuit. Ledesima Ies.
de Script. quavis ling. non legend. p. 161. In inclinatione Sacerdotis and

Jesuit) it forbids the words of Consecration to be delivered in a loud and
audible voice. So they.

CHALLENGE.
Do you see what your Church does profess? See also, we pray you,
notwithstanding, what your own Doctors are brought to Christus alta voce

confess (namely) first, that The Example of Christ and his Apostles is
against this uttering those words in a low and inaudible voice. Secondly, that
The same Custom was controlled by the practice of the whole Church of Christ,
both in the East part thereof (from the testimonies of ancient Liturgies, and
Fathers) and in the ancient Roman Church, by the witnessing of two Popes; in
whose time the People hearing the words of Consecration pronounced, did answer
thereunto, AMEN. Thirdly, that the same Innovation was much misliked by the
Emperor Justinian, who severely commanded by his Edict (as Novella Constit.

Ad Novellam.
you know) that The Priest should pronounce the words with a clear voice, that
they may be heard of the people. Whose authority you peremptorily contemn, as
though it did not belong to an Emperor to make Laws in this kind. But
forasmuch as the King of Kings, and the High Priest of Priests, the Son of
God, has said of this, as of the other such Circumstances, [Doe this,] who are
you, that you should dare to contradict this Injunction, by the practice of any
Priest, saying and speaking (yet not as Christ did, unto Them) but only to
himself, without so much as any pretense of Reason, Vtile est, ad reverentiam
tanti Sacramenti (ut Basil. recte docet l. de Sp. Sancto c. 27.) and multum
confert ad dignitatem and reverentiam mysteriorum ut non assuescant homines

Liturgijs Graecis Basilij and Chrysostom. praescribunt quaedamsub silentio
dice^da. -- In Liturgijs Chrysostom. Sacerdos orat (...), quod non significat
moderata voce, sed planesecreto. In Latinis Liturgijs, Innocentio rest,
praecipua pars Missae secreta erat. Bellar. quo supra. [Wee oppose 1. Never
were any words held secret, so, as not to be beard of them that were baptized,
and were allowed to be Communicants. Basil. speaks of the rites of Baptism
to be kept secret, but to whom? (...): and how secret? by silence of voice in
the Congregation? no, but, Non convenit circumferri, (...). And of what? of
words? nay, but (...). Neither does Chrysostom's (...), nor Innocentius his
Secreto infer any more than such a Service, in respect of them that were not
to be partakers of the Communion. Secondly, we oppose, concerning the point in
question, that the words of Institution were in th^se times pronounced with an
audible voice both in the Greek and Latin Churches (as has been confessed,
and their own Writings do verify:) Basil. Liturg. Sacerdos benedicens panem,
(...) -- alta voce dicens; Accipite, Hoc est corpus meum. Chrysostom. in 1. Cor.
15. Hom. 40. Vobis, qui mysterijs estis initiati ((...)) volo in memoriam
revocare eam dictionem, etc.] secundum Graec. Edit.
which might not likewise have moved the ancient Church of Christ, both Greek
and Roman, to the same manner of Pronunciation? Whereas the Catholic Church,
notwithstanding, for many hundred years together, precisely observed the
ordinance of Christ.

THE SECOND CHALLENGE.
In respect of the necessity of a Loud voice, especially by the Romish
Priest, in uttering the words of Consecration.

THe greatest silence, which is used by the Roman worshippers, is still in the
Priests uttering, or rather muttering the words of Institution [Hoc est corpus
meum: and, Hic est sanguis meus:] albeit here is the greatest and most
necessary Cause of expressing them, for the satisfaction of every
understanding Hearer among you. For those you call the Words of Consecration,
the just pronunciation whereof you hold to be most necessary: because if the
Priest, in uttering of them, fail but in one syllable, so far as to alter
the sense of Christ's words (which as you say may happen by six manner of
Defects) then the whole Consecration is void; and the thing, which you adore,
is in substance merely See Book 7. C. 5.. 2.
Bread still. If therefore the People shall stand perplexed in themselves,
whether the words, which are concealed, be duly uttered by the Priest to
himself, how shall it not concern them to hear the same expressly pronounced,
lest that (according to your own Doctrine) they be deluded in a point of
faith, and with divine worship adore Bread instead of the person of the Son
of God? Whereof we are to entreat at large in due Ibidem.
place, if God permit.

Your fifth Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass, is a second
Contradiction against the Sense of the former words of Christ [ -- SAID UNTO
THEM.]

SECT. VII.
Again, that former Clause of the Canon of Christ, to wit [He said unto them]
teaches that as his voice, Saying unto them, was necessarily audible, to reach
their ears; so was it also Intelligible, to instruct their understanding: and
therefore not uttered in a Tongue unknown. Which is evident by that he gives
a Reason for the taking of the Cup [Enim] For this is the blood, etc. which
particle [For (says your [ENIM.] Ea particula intelligitur in forma panis.
Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. c. 14.
Cardinal) is employed in the first part also. Now, whosoever reasons with
another, would be understood what he says.

The contrary Canon of the (now) Roman Mass.

The Council of Trent (says your Council. Trident. Sess. 22 c. 8. Statuit non
expedire ut divinum Officium vulgari passim lingua celebretur. Azor. Ies. Inst.
Moral. par. 1. l. 8. c. 26.. Verum-enimvero.
Jesuit) decreed, that it is not expedient that the Divine service should be
celebrated in a known tongue. Whereupon you doubt not to censure the contrary
Doctrine of Protestants to be Asserere Missas celebrandas esse lingua vulgari,

dormitasse aliquando, atque adeo errasse videatur. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract.
32. Sect. 5. p. 251
Heretical and Schismatic, and no ways to be admitted. But why? Lest (say
you) the Church may seem a long time to have been asleep, and to have erred
in her contrary Custom. So you. Our Church of England contrarily thus:
Article 24.
It is a thing repugnant to the Word of God, and Custom of the Primitive
Church to have public prayer, and ministering of the Sacraments in a tongue not
known of the people. This occasioneth a double Plea against your Church of
Rome, first, in defense of the Antiquity and Universality, next for the
Equity of Prayers in a known tongue, in the public service of God.

I. CHALLENGE.
Against the Romish Alteration of the Catholic and universal practice^ of the
Church, and the Antiquity thereof.

IN the examination of this point, Consider in the first place your own
Confessions, given by your Tempore Apostolorum totum populum respondere solitum
in diuinis officijs -- Et longo tempore post in Occidente and Orient Ecclesia:
tempore Chrysostomi, and Cypriani, atque Hieronymi, eadem Consuetudo invaluit.
Et Hieronymus scribit in praefat. lib. 2. ad Gal. In Ecclesijs vrbis Romae
quasi coeleste tonitru audiri populum reboaniem, Amen. Bellar. lib. 2. de verbo
Dei, cap 16. Sed neque. Tempore Apostolorum, cum celebratetur Sacrificium hoc,
Sacerdos dixit, [Hoc est corpus meu^] and populus respondebat, Amen. -- Et hic
usus manavit in totam Ecclesiam usque ad mill and amplius annos. Maldon. Ies.
Disp. de Sacram. Tom. 1. de Euch. Coni^ct. 1.. Vbi Scribit.
Jesuits, and others, acknowledging that In the days of the Apostles, and a
long time after, even for a thousand years and more, the whole Church, and in
it the People of Rome had knowledge of this part of service, concerning the
Sacrament, and used to say, AMEN! So you. And this is as much as we need to
require, concerning the judgment and practice of the true Antiquity of this
Custom. You will rather doubt (we suppose) of the Universality thereof,
because you usually go no farther then your Dictates, which teach, that
because there were generally but three general and known tongues, Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin, therefore the divine service was celebrated thorow-out the
Church in one of these three. And because these could not be the vulgar
language of every Christian Nation, it must follow (say Bellar. lib. 2. de
verbo Dei, cap. 15. and 16, and so Others also.
they) that the People of most Nations understood not the public Prayers used
in their several Churches. And with this Persuasion do your Doctors lock up
your consciences in a false belief of an universal Custom of an unknown
service of God. Which you may as easily unlock again, if you shall but use,
as a key, this one Observation, viz. That the three common tongues (namely)
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, although they were not always the vulgar
Languages, yet were they known Languages commonly to those people that used
them in Divine Service. Which one only Animadversion will fully demonstrate
unto us the truth of our Cause.

It is not denied but that the three Languages Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were,
in primitive ages, most Tres hae linguae vniuersalissimae, ita ut Hebraica per
totum fere Orientem: Omnes enim Chaldaica, aut Syriaca. i. Hebraica, sed
corrupt Ioquebantur. Graeca per totam Graeciam, and Asiam minorem, olim, ac
varias provincias late patebat: Latina autem per magnam Europae partem

universal; insomuch that the Hebrew was spoken (albeit corruptly) thorowout
almost the whole Eastern Church. The Greek was current through the whole
Greek Church also, and in the lesser Asia. And the Latin was dispersed over a
great part of Europe. It will now be fully sufficient to know, that the most of
these languages were certainly known, in public worship, unto all them of
whom they were used in public Sermons, and preachings. For your own Church,
howsoever she decreed of Praying, yet does she forbid Preaching in an unknown
tongue.

Now therefore join (we beseech you) the eyes of your bodies and mind together
in beholding and pondering our Marginals, and you shall find, first (if we
speak of the [Concionatus est Graece Chrysostomus apud Antiochenos, apud
Caesari^nses Basilius, apud Alexandrinos Athanasius, apud Hierosolymi^anos
Cyrillus.] Thus from Constantinople to Antioch, throughout Asia, was the Greek
Language universally known.
Greek Language) that there was a general knowledge thereof even among the
vulgar people of the Churches of Antioch, Caesarea, Alexandria, and thorowout
Asia. Secondly, if of the Latin, you may behold anciently the familiar
knowledge thereof in the Church of Rome, whereof St. See about, at the letter
(i.)
Hierome has testified, that The people were heard in the Churches of Rome
resounding and thundering out their Amen! This in Churches unmixed. Thirdly, in
mixed Congregations of Greek and Latin, that the Cum Ecclesia Romans de Latinis
and Graecis es^et permixta, singulae ^ectiones de utraque lingua recitabantur:
nam ab una lingua recitantes ab utriusque linguae populis intelligi non
poterant. Rupertus de Divine. offic. l. 3 c. 8.
Service was said both in Greek and Latin. Fourthly, your own general
Confession, yielding a common knowledge of the Latin tongue to the people of a
great part of Europe: and we say also of Afric, (insomuch that Augustine
does openly teach that the [Augustini sunt plurimi Tractatus and Sermones ad
Hipponenses suos. With whom he rather chose to speak ossum than os: to the
end they should understand him.] Lib. Retract. cap. 20. Psalmum, qui ijs

France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Pannonia, Dalmatia, and many other Nations
in the North and West: particularly manifested by the Latin Homelies and
writings, made to the people of Afric by Tertullian, Cyprian, and Augustine;
and in France and Germany by the people praying and jointly saying, AMEN.

Not to tell you of the now-Custome of the remote Christian Churches, such as
are the Egyptians, Russians, Ethiopians, Armenians, and others; All which
exercise their public Service in the vulgar and mother-tongues of their own
so distinct and different Nations. For the which cause they can find no better
entertainment with your Jesuits; than to admonish you that Cer tum est
(inquiunt Protestants) Ruthenos, Aegyptios, Aethiopes, Armenos, and quosdam
alios celebrare diuina Officia in Lingua vulgari. -- Respondemus, nos non
moveri Barbaroru^ moribus. Salmeron. Ies. Com. in 1. Cor. 16. Disp. 30..
Septimo.
You are not to be moved with the example of such barbarous people. O
Jesuitical superciliousnes! to contemn them as Barbarous, in an example of
praying in a known tongue: the contrary whereunto (as namely praying in an
unknown tongue) the Apostle condemns as 1. Cor. 14. 11.
Barbarousnes it self.

With the same modesty might you scoff at, and reproach other more ancient
Nations and Christians, commended by primitive Fathers for celebrating their
Oblations, Prayers, and Psalms in their National tongues; so, that one
repeating the words first, the whole people with joint voice and heart accorded
in ^inging. Among whom are recorded the converted De Iudaeis conversis, Ambros.
in 1. Cor. 14. Aliquando Syra Lingua, plerunque Hebraea in Oblationibus

^armonicall consent singing of Psalms, in the public worship: as also the

sunt. For the Sclavonians. See hereafter. 6. Challenge at (d)
Grecians, Egyptians, Thebaeans, Palestinians, Arabians, Phoenicians, and
Syrians. This from the Testimonies of holy Fathers.

Whether therefore the tongue we pray in be barbarous or learned, it is not
respected of God, but whether it be known or unknown, is the point. In which
respect we may usurp the Similitude which St. Aug. de doctr. Christ. l 4. c.
11. Quid prodest, etc.
Augustine has; What avails a golden Key, if it cannot open that which
should be opened? or what hur^eth a wooden Key, if it be able to open, seeing
that we desire nothing, but that the thing shut may be opened? By this time
you see your Noveltie in your Romish practice.

Behold in the next place the Iniquity and profaneness thereof, and how
after the death of Pope Gregory the first, which was about 608. years after
Christ, your Roman Church degenerated as much from the (then) Roman truth in
this point, as she did from her Roman tongue and Language it self. We are
here constrained to plead the whole cause, for the defense of a necessity of a
known worship, in respect of God, of Man, and of Both.

A SECOND CHALLENGE,
Showing the Iniquity of Service in an unknown tongue. And first of the
Injury done by the foresaid Roman Decree unto the souls of Men.

THe former Decree of your Council, for unknown Service, how injurious it is
unto man, we may learn by the Confessions of Jesuits and others, Apostolus
praecip it, ut Preces ad aedificationem fiant, quemadmodum probatur Romans 15. --
Plus lucratur, quoad intellectum and affectum, qui non ignorant quae orat. --
Qui non intelligit, non aedificatur, in quantum non intelligit in speciali,
licet in generali intelligat. -- Ad fructum devotionis conducibilius
intelligendo orare. Aquinas in 1. Cor. 14. Iubet Apostolus ut ad ae
dificationem abundent: melius est orare mente, distinct intelligente ea quae
orat, quam confuse. Et ex hac doctrina habetur, melius esse ut public preces

dicantur, quam Latin^. Caietan. Cardin. in eum locum. 1. Cor. 14. Paulus vult

idiomata ab ijs, qui sunt eiusdem linguae, intelliguntur. Salmeron. Ies. Com.
sup. eum locum 1. Cor. 14. [which he confesses of the Apostles times.]
granting that The Apostles in their times required a known Language, Greek
in the Greek Churches, and Latin in the Latin Churches: because that first
this made for the Edification and Consolation of Christians. Secondly, that Man
gains more both in mind and affection, who knows what he prays. As for
him that is Ignorant, you say, He is not edified, in as much as he knows not
in particular, although in general he does understand. Thirdly, that the
Apostle commands that all things be done to edification. Fourthly, that the
known Service is fitter for Devotion: and thereupon some of you have
furthermore Concluded, that It were better that the Service were used in a
Language known both to the Clergy and People. And again, that People profit
no whit by praying in a strange language. So your own Writers, as you may
observe in the Marginals.

Now what more extreme and intolerable Injury could you do to the souls of
Gods people, than by imposing a strange language upon them, thereby (according
to your own Confessions) to deprive them, and that wittingly, of Edification,
Consolation, and Devotion, the three chief Benefits that man's soul is
capable off, in the service of God? Thus in respect of your Injury against Man.

A THIRD CHALLENGE,
Touching the Injury done, by the same Decree, against God himself.

YEt all this notwithstanding, you are bent to cozen Christian people, with
palpable Sophistry, by your Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 16. De Canticis
Spiritualibus tempore Primitivae Ecclesiae Tert.. Porro consuevisse. -- Quoniam
igitur ista Cantica fiunt ad Populi consolationem, vult Apostolus, ut fiant
lingua quae intelligatur: ut Idiota, etc. Ibid.. Quoniam -- Praeterea tunc,
quia Christiani erant pauci, omnes simul psallebant in Ecclesia and
respondebant diuinis officijs: at postea, crescente populo, divisa sunt magis
officia, and solis Clericis relictum est, ut communes preces and lauds in
Ecclesia peragant. Ibid.. Respondeo negando. -- Denique finis praecipuus
illorum Canticorum erat instructio and consolatio populi, -- and nisi lingua
nota facta fuissent -- periisset praecipuus fructus ipsorum: At Divinorum
officiorum nec est finis praecipuus instructio, vel consolatio populi, sed
cultus Dei. Ibid.. Denique finis.
Cardinal, who confesses that the Psalms in the days of the
Primitiue-Church, were sung jointly of the people, Because they were ordained
for instruction and consolation of the people, as the chief end. But as for
the Divine Service, The Principal end of it (says he) is not the instruction
and consolation of the people, but the worship of God. So he. Whom when we
ask, why the people then did all join together both in Singing of Psalms,
and Answering the Minister in Divine Service, and Prayer? He says it was
because of the Pauscitie of people, and rareness of the Assembly. Whereby it
seems he meant to maintain Your Degenerate Romish Worship with Paradoxes;
First, As if Psalms, publicly sung in the Church to Gods glory, were not
Divine duties and service. Secondly, As if the Primitive Church, using both
Psalms and other Prayers in a known tongue (as he confesses) did not bold a
necessity of the Common knowledge of both, for Instruction and Consolation.
Thirdly, As if the Assemblies of Christians were of such a Paucitie in the
days of Tertullian; when those Psalms ordained for Instruction and
Consolation were in use. And fourthly, as if People now adays had not as much
need of Instruction and Consolation, as they that lived in Primitive-times;
yea, and more, especially such People, who being led blindfold by an Implicit
Faith, have reason to crave Instruction; and having their Consciences tortured
and perplexed with multiplicities of Ceremonial Laws, have as just cause also
to desire Consolation.

As for your obiecting the Worship of God by unknown prayers; that may be
sufficient, which your own Catechism (authorized by the Council of Trent)
teaches you; where answering to that question, why God, although he know our
wants before we pray, yet will be solicited by our prayers? it Cur Deus, cum
sciat quibus indige^us, vult oratione nostra sollicitari? Vult nos ^ite petendo
petere fidentius -- ut magis ad amorem incendamur -- ac ut saepius majori
affecti laetitia ad cumamandum atque colendum incitemur ardentius. Catech.
Trid. v^l Romans part. 4. Cap. 2. page 386.
says, that he does this to the end, that Praying more confidently, we may
be more inflamed with love toward God: and so being possessed with more joy,
may be exercised to a ^ervent worship of God. So your public and general
Roman Catechism.

The case then is plain. From more Edification there arises more Consolation;
from more Consolation there issues more Devotion; from all these proceeds more
filial Love and dutiful Worship of God. Which was long since shadowed (as
Exodus 15. [Can^emus Domino] Can^abat Moses and Miriam, nempe Moses, id est,

singing unto the Lord: Moses signifying the understanding part, and Miriam
betokening the Affection; both notifying, that we are to sing Hymns both
affectionately and understandingly unto God. Therefore, if you be men of
Conscience, recant that your now objected Barbarous Paradoxe, Which (contrary
to all anciently-professed Divinity, and express Scripture, saying, 1. Cor.
14. 15.
I will pray with my spirit, I will pray with my understanding also) does
thrust man's Understanding out of God's worship, to the utter abolishing of
(...), that is, his Reasonable worshipping of God; by making man (as Saint Aug.
Expos. 2. in Psalm. 18. Merulae, Psi^taci, Corvi, Picae, and hujusmodi volucres
saepe docentur ab hominibus sonare quod nesciunt: scienter vero cantare non
avi, sed homini Divina voluntate concessum est.
Augustine notes) no better than O^zells, Parrots, Ravens, and Mag-pies, all
which learn to prate they know not what.

THE FOVRTH CHALLENGE,
Against the said Romish Decree, as jointly injurious both to God and Man, from
the Text of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 14.
IN the fourth place We are to speak of the Iniquity of your unknown
language in Prayer, jointly against both God and Man; because that without the
understanding of the Prayer it is impossible for a man (being of discretion) to
pray unto, or to praise God as he ought: and consequently to obtain any
blessing by prayer from God, according to that Apostolical Doctrine, 1. Cor.
14. where he says of the man ignorant of the language of prayer, [(...);] How
shall he say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knows not what thou
say? To which Argument of the Apostles, taken from the Impossibility, your
Dici^ Apostolus [ut instruam] Expende vocem hanc, ^nstruam; quod sit de
p^aedicatione, non de Missae celebra^ione. Eckius Enchrid. Quaes^. Missa

de verbo Dei c. 16. Ad hanc.
Eckius and some Others answer, that the Apostle speaks of Preaching, and
not of Praying. What, not of Praying, Eckius? May it not be said of this your
great Doctor, and Antagonist to Luther, that this man could not see the River
for water? for (as your Imo sequitur [(...)] quibus verbis Apostolus significat
precari, etc. Bellar. ibid.
Cardinal confesses) in the text it self the Apostle uses these three
words, Pray, sing, and give thanks. Will you now seek an Evasion from Mr.
Master Breerley in his Liturgy of the Mass, Tract. 5. Sect. 4. ad finem.
Brereley Pr. collecting (as he says) the Contrary in the Apostle, as
affirming that not the whole vulgar, but some one was especially appointed to
supply the place of the unlearned to say Amen? Which Reason he may seem to
have borrowed from your Providet sapienter Ecclesia, ut Minister vice totius
populi respondeat: imo hoc est quod Apostolus ai^, cum subdit, Qui supplet

Senensis, who says that The Apostle by him [That occupies the place of the
vnlearned] meant the Clarke of the Parish, and not the vulgar people.

But this is thought of your Bellarmine, and others, to be but an unlearned
Answer, because that In the days of the Apostle (says Tempore Apost lorum

the same place.
he) There was not any such office ordained, as is the Clarke of the Parish:
and if there had been any such, yet the Greek phrase [(...)] would not admit
of any such interpretation. So he.

Lastly, it can be no less than an extreme Infatuation to appose (as
Satisfacit Sacerdos, cu^^preces etiam non intellectas absolvit: etiam meretur,
modo in Dei lauds preces non intellectas peroret. Sic in Monasterijs
professae, and Monachi non pauci orant, quae intellectu non modo non

the Rhemists in Matthew. 21. Verse 16. and in 1. Cor. 19. page 463.
do your Jesuit Salmeron, Eckius, and the Rhemists) the example of Children;
because the Children crying Hosanna, and not understanding their prayers, were
notwithstanding (say they) accepted of Christ. Ergo the Priest, Monks, and
Nuns, in praising God may be grateful to God, although they understand not
that which they pray. So they. An Objection taken (as you see) from Children,
or rather, as it might seem, made by Children, it is altogether so Childish.
For the Apostle, as it were foreseeing that this might possibly be fancied by
some fond and obstinate Opposers to the Spirit of Truth, does in the very same
Chapter 1. Cor. 14. 20. purposely prevent it, saying; Brethren, be not children
in understanding. For although, when a Child asks his Fathers blessing only
with clapping his hands together, or uttering half syllables, it joyeth the
Father, because his Child now expresses his duty, according to the Capacity
of a Child: yet if the same Child, after he is come to the perfect years of
discretion, should perform that duty in no better manner than by childish
babbling, would the Father hold this to be Reverence, and not rather plain
Mocquerie? So is the Case betwixt us and 2. Cor. 8. 12.
God, who accepts every one according to that which he has, and not
according to that which he has not: A Child in the capacity of a Child, but
a man according to to the apprehension of a man. In which consideration the
Apostle says, 1. Cor. 13. 11. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, but
being a man I put away childishness. Away therefore with this your more than
Childish Objection.

We return to the Impossibility of praying duly in an unknown tongue,
which the Apostle illustrateth by two Similitudes, the one taken from an
Instrument of peace, Verse 7. He that knows not the distinct sound of the
Pipe [(...);] How shall he know what is piped? that is, it is impossible for
him to apply himself to the dance. The other from an Instrument of war,
Verse 8. If the Trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to
battle? As if he would have said, It is impossible to know when to to march
forward, or when to retraite. So it is said of unknown Prayer [(...);] How
shall he that is ignorant of the language say Amen? that is to say (by the
interpretation of your Populus ignorae linguae quomodo respondebit, Amen? hoc
est, animae praebebit assensum, cum more Babylonice co^fusionis qui dissident,
nequaquam sensu animisque conspirent. Acosta Ies. de Indorum salute cap. 6. p
37.
^esuite) How shall people, ignorant of the tongue, answer Amen? (that is)
yield consent unto the Prayer, seeing that they, who dissent among themselves
after a Babylonish confusion, cannot consent in mind and affection. So he. Or,
as your Quomodo dicet, [Amen?] Cum quid boni dicas non intelligit, ni^i
benedicas tantum. Aquinas in hunc locum, 1. Cor. 14. I add Sander. de visib.
Monarch. ad Ann. 1563. [Si benedixeris spiricu] Quomodo dicat Amen?
Significatur de precibus Ecclesiasticis, ^ateor, quas in spiritu, hoc est, in
dono linguae peregrinae recitari nollet, ut in Latina Ecclesia Hebraeam, aut in
Graeca Persicam: quia deessent plerunque viri docti and periti illius linguae,
qui populo interpretari possent. [Thus from the Apostle he grants, that
Prayers are not to be used, where the people have not the interpretation:
although he say, that Deus honori^ic entius colitur perlinguam doctam, quam
per indoctam and vulgarem. As though where there is no respect of persons with
God, yet there should be respect of the Tongues.]
Aquinas; How shall he say, Amen, who understands not what good words thou
speak, but only knows that thou blessest? Thus in one Transgression you
commit a double Sacrilege, to wit, by Robbing God of his due Honor, and Men of
their spiritual graces and Comforts.

To conclude. These Premises do prove, that among many thousands of your
people, assembled at a Roman Mass, and being ignorant of their Service, not
any such an one (a miserable Case!) can justly be held to be a true Worshipper
of God, who requires of his Worshippers the Hos. 14. 2. and Heb. 13. 15.
Calves of their lips, and not (as now they make themselves) the lips of Calves.

THE FIFTH CHALLENGE,
Out of the Doctrine of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 14. more copiously in confutation
of your diverse Objections.

IT were an easy matter to be superfluous in the prosecuting of this
Argument, by proving the truth of this Doctrine out of the Testimonies of
ancient Fathers, if it were imaginable that any Reply could be made to that
which is already said. But yet behold an In his aforementioned writing to a
Lady, etc.
Anonymus, having had notice of most of these points, has formed such
Objections and Answers, as his prejudicated and purblinde Conceit could reach
unto. First, in answer to the places objected out of 1. Cor. 14. affirming
(out of the Rhemish Annotations) That the Apostle speaks not of the public
and set prayers of the Church, but of extraordinary and spiritual exercises
of Exhortations, and sudden Prayors. So he. Wherein the man contradicts
your own Alij dicunt Apostolum loqui de divinis officijs, viz. Haymo,
Primasius, P. Lombardus, D. Thomas, and alij quidam ex Latinis. Test Bellar.
l. 2. de verb. Dei^ cap. 16.
Schoolmen, but especially the Apostle his direct saying, Verse 23. If the
whole Congregation meet together etc. what more public than that Assembly of
the whole Congregation? And (to suppose that they were extraordinary Prayers)
what is more consectarie and Consequent, than that if the Apostle note it for
an Abuse, to practice such extraordinary Exercises of Preaching and Praying in
a tongue unknown, even because the Hearers are not thereby Edified
(doubtless) the same Abuse practiced in public and ordinary Service, being
more notorious and Common, must needs be so much the more condemnable: as
witness both Ancient Fathers, and your own Brethren, who have taught the use
of a known Tongue, in all public and ordinary service of God, from this
Text of Scripture, which (as you say) speaks of Prayers extraordinary.

Yea, but It is sufficient (says he) that the vulgar people know, in general,
although they understand not the Prayers in particular. Which again
Contradicts the Apostle, who in the sixteenth Verse will have the Private or
Vulgar man to be able to give consent to the public Prayer, in saying Amen.
And therefore requires the Minister, Verse 7. as the Harper, to yield in
particular a Distinction of tunes [(...):] and Verse 8. as a Trumpetter,
[(...)] to give a certain known sound; that which your own Doctors have also
confessed.

A third Instance is taken out of Bellarmine, who says that Non reprehenditur
oration non intellecta, sed ^i anteponitur oration quae intelligitur, ut patet
Verse 17. [Tu quidem been gratias agis, sed alter non aedificatur] Bellar. quo
supra.
The Apostle reprehendeth not an unknown Prayer, but prefers a known
Prayer before the other, saying Verse 7. Thou, indeed, prayest well, but
another is not edified. Flatly contradictorie to the whole scope of the
Apostle, throughout the Chapter, as your own Salmeron. Ies. See above
Challenge 2. at the let. (z.)
Jesuit is forced to proclaim. The Apostle (says he) would have the people
to be edified, because then all things ought to have been done to the
Edification and Consolation of the Assembly: and therefore he would not have
any Public Prayer used among the Hebrews but in the Hebrew-language; nor
among the Grecians but in Greek; nor yet among the Latins, but in the Latin
tongue. The meaning then is [Thou indeed] namely, who art the Minister, and
know the prayer, so far do^t well; but in respect of others, which cannot
understand, Not well, because, They are not edified.

His fourth Objection he wresteth out of the fourth Verse. [If I pray with my
tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is without fruit.] So he. As
though that strange Tongue, here spoken off, were not understood by him that
prayed. Which contradicts the Apostle, Verse 4. He that speaks with the
tongue does edify himself: for never did any deny that he, who had the
miraculous gift of Speech in a strange tongue, did understand himself,
although sometimes he wanted the gift of interpreting it, for the understanding
of all others. Therefore says the Apostle, Verse 13. [He that speaks with
the tongue let him pray, that he may interpret it.] Fifthly, by the word
[Spirit] Id est, si ore^* do^o linguae: nimirum, quam non intelligam [Spiritus]
id est Affectus meus orat, sed men's est sine fructu. Ergo dicit Apostolus, non
Orationem sed mentem esse sine fructu. Bellar. quo sup. And this Answer M.
Breeely borrowed from Bellar. Tract. upon the Mass, page 452.
your Cardinal would have understood the Affection, as if Affection without
understanding did profit him that prays: which is fully contrary to the
Apostles Doctrine, as witnesses Vox [Spiritus] a principio usque ad ^inem
Donum Spiritus peculiare significat, quo impellebantur linguis lequi. Si
Apostolus in hac voceadmitteret Homonymiam aliqua^ Graeci Patres nos de eo
admonuissent. Salmeron. Ies. in eund. locum.
your Salmeron in plain terms; showing that the word, Spirit, thorow-out this
whole Chapter, signifies not the Affection, but the miraculous Spiritual gift
of speaking in Strange tongues, as also the Upon the same place both Ambrose,
[Spiritu, id est, lingua ignota] and Chrysostom also.
Fathers expound it.

In the next place the aforesaid Anonymus contendeth by Reason, but such as
others reached unto him. Fathers say (says he) the words of Consecration
should be kept secret. True, to them that were not capable of this Sacrament,
but never to the licenced Communicants; because that Christ, and his Apostles,
yea, and the Universal Church primitive consecrated in an audible voice, and
known language, as has been confessed. Yet furthermore, The Church (says
he) used the said Hebrew word, Allelujah, unknown to the people. What then?
know you not that in all Churches, of whatsoever language, is used also the
Hebrew word, Amen? and if people do not learn one or two words of a strange
tongue, it is not for that they are witless, but because they are wilful and
careless.

Their last Reason. Some languages (as for example that in Italy) were Roman
and corupted by invasion of Enemies of diverse languages, and in the end became
Italian, etc. yet the public Service was not altered, but continued Roman as
before. This Argument is a facto ad jus, all one with that Reasoning a Baculo
ad angulum. Like as if some should Conclude, that because Stews are allowed at
Rome, they are therefore justly licenced. But we demand, are men made for
languages, or rather languages for men? if the first, then all men were bound
to learn all languages. If the latter, then is that language to be used, which
is known to serve best for the Edification and Consolation of God's people in
his worship.

A SIXTH CHALLENGE,
Out of the Doctrine of Antiquity.

ALthough it were preposterous to exact of us a proof, from Antiquity, of
condemning the Service in a strange tongue, seeing (as has been confessed)
the Primitive practice is wholly for us; and therefore no Abuse in those times
could occasion any such Reproof: yet shall we, for your better illumination,
offer unto you some more express Suffrages of the ancient Fathers, after that
we shall have satisfied your Objections, pretended to make for your Defense.
Saint Augustine says of the People, that their Safety consists not in the
vigor of their understanding, but in their simplicity of believing. So indeed
does Aug. de Bap. l. 6. c. 24. Multi irruunt in preces, etiam ab Haereticis
compositas, and per ignorantiae simplicitatem non valentes decernere, utuntur
cis, and plerunque precis vitium superat precantis affectus. -- Non quia ista
corrigenda non sint, ut populus ad id, quod plane intelligat, dicat Amen Idem
de Catechizand. rudibus c. 9. Test Cassandro in Liturg. page ^0^.
Augustine forewarne the people, who although they knew the single words of the
prayers of Heretics, yet might possibly be deluded with the obscurity of
their Heretical Senses. The Difference is extreme. For Saint Augustine's
people understood the language of those prayers, in the obscure and inuolued
Sense whereof they were unwillingly igno^ant. But your Popish people are
wilfully ignorant both of the Words and Sense. The odds therefore is no less
than this; they were simply, yours are sottishly ignorant, and Augustine
wishes that their Simplicity were corrected; you hold your Peoples blindness
worthy to be commended.

Secondly, Origin says, that when Christians are exercised in reading of holy
Scripture, albeit some words be not understood, yet is that reading profitable.
This Sentence also is alleged for countenancing of Origin Hom. ^0. in ^os^
Quae nos proferimus saepe non intelligimus, sed virtutes intelligunt. Ergo
licet preces non intellectas usurpare. Ob. Bellar. l. 2. deverbo Dei cap. 16.
Prayer in an unknown tongue; notwithstanding that, in a man's Reading of
Scripture, God is said to speak unto man: but in Praying, man is said to
speak unto God. So that it may be both lawful and profitable to the Reader,
to find some particular Scriptures, which God would have to excel the
Capacity of the most learned, to humble them, to the admiration of his
excellent wisdom, as the Fathers teach. Whereas contrarily an unknown Prayer,
wittingly used, is both unprofitable and unlawful, as has been copiously
confessed by your own Divines, from the Doctrine of the Apostle.

More Objections out of the Fathers you have not. We will try whether we can
recompense your Nominalities (that we may so call your impertinent Objections)
with Realities and soli^ Proofs. Cast but your eyes upon the Marginals,
consisting partly of the Relation of your own Johannes Billet in summa de
divinis offlcijs; In primitiva Ecclesia (inquit) prohibitum erat, ne quis
loqueretur linguis, nisi intelligerentur. -- At nostris temporibus, ubi nullus
aut rarus invenitur legens vel audiens, qui intelligat, completum est quod a
Propheta dicitur: Erit Sacerdos ut populus. Videtur potius esse tacendum quam
psallendum. Innocent. 3. in Conc. genesis in lib. Decret. de offic. Iud. Ordinar.

Collections, and you shall find, among the Fathers, Ambros. in 1. Cor. 14.
[Qui supplet locum Idiotae, quomodo dicet Amen ad benedictionem tuam, quia
nescit quid dicis?] Imperitus n. nesciens quid dicitur, nescit finem orationis,
and non respondet Amen. Verum, ut confirmetur benedictio: per hos n. qui

ad aedificandam Ecclesiam convenitis, ca debent dici, quae intelligant
Audientes: nam quid prodest, ut quis lingua loquatur, quam solus scit? ideo
tacere debet in Ecclesia, ut ij loquantur qui prosunt Audientibus.
Ambrose denying that He, who is the person ignorant of the Prayer, can give
consent unto it, by saying Amen: and thereupon infers, that only Such things
should be spoken in the public Congregation, which the Hearers understand.
Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. 14. [Barbarus] Et ille mihi, and ego illi, non utique ob
naturam vocis, sed ob imperitiam -- Et qui non intelligit quid loquatur, sibi

monstratque non leave impedimentum esse, si non intelligat. [Omnia ad
aedificationem.] Aedificare. n. Architecti est opus, and per omnia proximum
juvare -- Si n. aedificandi gratia non venis, quid necesse est omnino venisse?
Chrysostom noting a Man, Ignorant of the Prayer, to be no better then a
Barbarian to himself, not in respect of the nature of the voice, but of his
own ignorance; and declaring Prayers, in an unknown tongue, to be contrary to
the Apostles Doctrine, who requires that All things be done to edification.
Isidor. de Eccles offic. l. 1. cap 10. Oportet, quando oratur, ut ab omnibus
oretur.
Isiodore peremptorily affirming an [Oportet,] and duty, that All may be able
to Pray in public places of prayer. Theophylact noting that Theophylact. in 1.
Cor. 14. [Tugra^ias been agis, sed alius non aedificatur.] Proximiutilitate
rejecta, inutiles erant huiusmodi gratiae.
The giving of thanks to God is unprofitable, where the edification of the
people is neglected. Augustine, in his Comment upon the Psalms, often
exhorting all sorts of men to sing them: and thereupon the In the Preface of an
unknown Author before the Prologue of S. Aug. upon the Psalms: Quo modo
debite potest Deo psallere, qui ignorant quid psallat?
Author of the Preface before his Comment (as it were tuning his note to
Augustines) does deny that any can sing Psalms as he ought to God, who knows
not what he sings.

And, lest that this might not suffice, we have added the Sea above in the
begi^ing of the 6. Sect. letter (d.)
Edict of the Emperor I^stinian, commanding a loud voice in the Minister, that
the people may understand his words. Next, a Canon of a Council, requiring a
See a little before at the letter (x.)
Concordance both of voice and understanding in the singing of Psalms, as that
which ought to be by that Doctrine of Scripture [I will pray with my spirit,
and I will pray with my understanding.] Then, a Decree of one Pope, in his
Council, that provision be made, where people of diverse Languages dwell in the
same Cities, that their Ibid. at the letter (u)
Service may be done according to their Different tongues. After, the
Resolution of another Pope, to grant unto the Ibid.
Sclavonians, at their conversion to the faith, that Divine Service might be
used in their own tongue; moved thereunto, as by a voice from heaven, sounding
out that Scripture; Let every tongue praise the Lord. And lastly, Ibid.
a Prohibition in the Primitive Church, that None should speak in languages
unknown to the people.

When you have disgested all these Premises, concerning the Equity and
Necessity of known Prayers in the public and Divine Service, both in
consideration of God's worship and Man's manifold profit, so amply confirmed by
so many and uncontrollable testimonies, then guess (if you can) of what dye
the face of your Doctor Stapleton was, when he shamed not to call this our
Practice of known prayers Quod aute^ omnia vernacu^e fiunt in Ecclesis, plane
profanum est. Stapleton. spec. pravit. Haeret. p. 580.
Profaneness? and to number it among Heretical pravities. As for your own
People, who prefer an unknown worship, what can we say less than that all
such Ignorants are but dumb worshippers, and because of their ignorance, in
praying they know not what, they are to be sent to accompany Popiniayes and
Iack-dawes, accordingly as St. See above, Sect. 7. in the Challenge 3.
Augustine formerly has resembled them.

The sixth Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass, contradicting the
Sense of the next words of Christ's Institution, [TAKE YE.]

SECT. VIII.
THus said Christ to his Disciples; by which words what is meant, your Jesuit
will express (to wit) that Quia Apostoli non acciperent nisi quod ipse dabat,

Because the Apostles took that which Christ gave, the word [GAVE] does
signify a Delivery out of Christ his hands into the hands of them that did
take. Here, you see, is Taking with hands; especially seeing that Christ, in
giving the Cup, said, Drink you all; Math. 26. one delivering it to an other

Church, for above 500. years, was, according to Christ's Institution, to
deliver the Bread into the hands of the Communicants. Secondly, that the same
Order was observed at Rome (as appears by the Epistle of Pope Cornelius.)
Thirdly, that whereas Some had devised, for Reverence-sake, certain Silver
vessels, by the which they received the Sacrament; yet two Councels, the one at
Toledo, and the other at Trullo, did forbid that fashion, and required that
they should receive it with their hands. Hitherto from you selves.

Vain, therefore, is your pretense of Reverence, in suffering the Priest only
to receive it with his hands, as being more worthy in himself than all the
rest of the people: when as our High Priest Christ Jesus disdained not to
deliver it into the hands of his Disciples. Or else to deny this liberty unto
the people, as if their Hands were less sanctified than their mouths.

But you will say that it is in Reverence, lest that the body of Christ may (as
you teach) light upon the ground, if any fragments of the Host should chance
to fall. There can be no doubt, but that in the dispensation of this blessed
Sacrament Christians ought to use due Cautelousnes, that it may be done without
miscarriage; yet must you give us leave to retort your pretense of Reverence
upon your selves, thus: Seeing that Christ himself Instituted, and his
Apostles observed, and that the whole Church of Christ (for so many hundred
years) thus practiced the administration of this Sacrament from hand to hand,
without respect of such Reverence, they therefore were not of your opinion, to
think every Crumme or piece of the Host, that falls to the ground, to be
really the Body of Christ.

This Aberration we may call, in respect of others, but a small Transgression,
if yet any Transgression may be called small, which is a wilful violating of
this so direct a Charge of Christ, [Doe this.]

The seventh Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass, contradicting the
Sense of the next words, [EATE YE.]

SECT. IX.
AS in the third Transgression, we, by these words of Christ [He gave it to
them,] spoken in the plural number, have proved from your own Confessions, a
necessary Communion of the people in the public Celebration thereof, with the
Priest, against your (now) Profession of private Masses, contrary to the
ancient Custom and universal practice of the Church: so now out of these
words [TAKE YE, EAT YEE] we observe that the persons present were Takers and
Eaters of the blessed Eucharist, and not only Spectators thereof. An Abuse
condemned by our Church of Eugland in her 25. Article saying, Sacraments were
not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon.

The Contrary Canon of the (now) Roman Mass.

But your Practice now is flat contrary, in your Church, by admitting people of
all forts, not as the Lords Guests to Eat of the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper; but as Gazers, only to look on it, as upon a proper Sacrifice:
telling the People that they, seeing the Priest eat and drink, Synod.

But Christ (you see) instituted this Sacrament only for Eaters. The Apostle
exhorts every man to Preparation; Let a man examine himself: and exhorting
every one, being prepared, to Eat, says, So let him eat. This (to use your

generally invited; Come, Brethren, unto the Communion. When as ancient Fathers
(as you have also acknowledged) suffered none but Communicants to be present at
the celebration of the Eucharist. As for them that came unprepared, and as not
intending to Communicate, they commanded them to be gone, and to be packing out
of doors. To this purpose your own Relator tells you, from other Authors,
of the practice of Antiquity, and of other succeeding Churches, in not
suffering any to be present, but such as did Communicate; and of removing and
expelling them that did not.

Nor can the Church of Rome justly take exception at this, seeing that in the
Roman Church also, in the days of P. Greg. the first, which (l) Sciendum est,

If any do not communicate, let him give place. Where we see the religious
wisdom of that ancient Church of Rome, which could not suffer a Sacrifice to
devour a public Sacrament, and to exclude a Communion: Whereunto the
Scriptures gave the name of (...), that is, a Gathering together, and (...),
that is, a Communion; as also of The Supper of the Lord. Yea and Calixtus, a
Pope more ancient than Gregory, required that persons present should
Communicate: Calixtus P. ut habetur de Consecrat. Did. 2. C. Peracta. --
Peracta Consecratione, omnes communicent, -- Sic enim Apostoli statuerunt, and
sancta tenet Ecclesia.
Because (says he) the Apostles had so ordained; and our Church of Rome
observes the same.

But what have We said? have We called this Sacrament the Supper of our Lord?
so (we thought) were we taught by the Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. before we heard
your Jesuit Calvinistarum and Lutheranorum inscitia, Sacramentum hoc Coenam
appellantium: atqui nullus in sacris literis locus est, ubi Coena vocatur. Vbi
dicit D. Paulus, [Iam non est Dominica^ Coenam manducare] nullo judicio

Maldonate denying this, and bitterly inveying against Protestants, terming
them Blind men for want of judgment, for so calling it. But he must pardon us,
if we (though we should suspect our own sight) yield to the ancient Fathers
of Primitive times, as to men far more clearesighted than that Jesuit could
be; who (as both your Vetustissimi Patres, Apostolorum authoritatem secuti,

sufficient to behold it only as a proper Sacrifice (as you pretend) the same

This then you perceive is a matter of no small importance, even by reason of
the nature of this Sacrament, which is a Divine Banquet; being also enjoined
upon the Catholic Church by that Command of Christ, [DOE THIS.] Therefore the
Command and Precept coming, makes you Transgressors for not- Eating; even as
by the first Command given unto mankind of [Eate not] our first Parents became
Transgressors for Eating. So justly does our Exhortation before the Communion.
Church require, that Gazers, who comunicate not, should depart. We forbear to
repeat that which we have formerly See above Chap. 1.. 2.
prooved (to wit,) that you, by not dismissing the non-Communicants from
beholding the Celebration this Sacrament, are condemned by the word Mass,
whereof you have so long boasted, until that now your Glory is become your
shame.

The Eight Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass, by a second
Contradiction of the Sense of the former words [EATE YE.]

SECT. X.
THis is the last Act of Christ, concerning the use of the first Element, viz.
[Bread] saying, EAT YE; even as he said of the other, [Drinke ye.] and of
both he gave this his joint Command [Doe this.] Wherefore this Act of Eating
being thus prescribed, as the only bodily outward end of this Sacrament, it
does exclude all other bodily Uses of man's invention. Accordingly our Church
of England Article 25. says, Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be
carried about, but to be duly used.

The contrary Canon of the Roman Mass.

The holy Synod of Trent (says your Statuit sacrosancta Synodus Trident. Sess
13. c. 5. Divinum hoc Sacrame^tum public interdu^ proponendum, vel
circumferendum esse per vias and loca publica cum solenni pompa and
veneratione. Quae est laudabilis consuetudo. Suarez Ies. in Thom. 3. Tom. 3.
Disp. 65. Sect. 1. p. 827.
Jesuit) has ordained that this Sacrament be preserved, carried abroad, and
publicly proposed to the people in Procession, with solemn Pomp and Worship.
Which is a laudable Custom.

CHALLENGE.
WE do not dispute against all manner of Reservation of the Eucharist, for
we acknowledge some to be ancient; but we inquire into the religious use and
end of Reservation: which, we say, was not for any public Profession, or
Adoration, but only for a Sacramental Eating thereof. And how unjustly you
call this your Procession (only for public Adoration) Laudable, we are
provided to demonstrate by the Confessions of your own Jesuits and others
(out of Cyprian, and other Fathers) who, consulting first about Antiquity,
grant that, after the Celebration of the Eucharist, anciently Prisca consuetudo
erat dandi Eucharistiam infantib', ut ex Cypr. and alijs constat: and si
aliquae particulae superessent, mos erat ut puori impuberes, qui Ecclesiam
frequentabant, accerserentur, ut eas consumerent. Suarez. Ies. quo supra, Disp.

Quod si remanserint in crastinum, non serventur, sed cum timore and tremore in
Sacrario consumantur. Clemens P. apud Gratian. de Consecra. D. 2.
Pope Clement witnesses. And although in the times of extreme persecution
Christians were permitted to take the Eucharist, and carry it home to their
houses, yet it was (as you Quondam, imminente persecutione, domum deportabant,
and asservabant, cum opus esset sumpturi -- Consuetudo post per Conc. Toletanum
antiquata. Durant. de Ritib. l. 1. c. 16. number. 11.
grant) to no other end but that they might eat it: and this only in the time
of Persecution: After which time the same Custom was abrogated. So you. How
then can you call the Reservation of the Host, for public Procession, and not
for Eating, Laudable, which has been thus checked and gain-sayed by so
sincere Antiquity?

Secondly, when you please to reveile unto us the first Birth of your own
Roman Custom, you grant that it was not until a Hist. Mediolan. Anno 1404.
Circumferri coeptum, etc. Quam Processionem tanta laetitia and consensione, ac
laeta solennitate prosecuta est Latina Ecclesia. Nam de Graeca nihil mihi

any such Circumgestation in the Greek Church.
Thousand four hundred years after Christ. And must it then be called a
Laudable Custom, whereby (that we may so speak) beardlesse noveltie does take
place of sage and gray headed Antiquity?

Thirdly, in discussing the end, which was destinated by our Savior Christ,
you further grant, that Primarius finis servandi Eucharistiam semper fuit
manducatio: servatur enim ad viaticum infirmorum. Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. c. 5..
Deinde. Sacramentum per se est dandum propter suum primarium effectum, and non
alias. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 62. Sect. 4.. Secunda Sent.
The primitive and principal end, prescribed by Christ, is for Sacramental
eating: and that the Sacrament is to be given for this, as it is primary effect.
And yet notwithstanding for you to bring in a Pompous ostentation of not-
Eating, and to call it a Laudable Custom, argues what little Congruitie there
is between your Practice, and Christ's Institution. And how much less
Laudable will this appear to be, when we consider the gross and intolerable
Abuses of your Processions, which are displayed by your own Authors? Noting
in them the very fooleries of the Ita Romani factitabant, and aliae pleraeque

your Custom were abrogated, Videtur hic Circumgestationis usus etiam cum

Crantziuslaudat Nic. Cusanum Legatum per Germaniam, quod abusum eius, in nimis

Thinking that it may be omitted with profit to the Church, both because it is
but an Innovation, and also for that it serves most-what for ostentation and
pomp, rather than pious Devotion. So they.

Lastly, lest you may object (as else where) that a Negative Argument (as this,
because Christ did not institute this Custom, therefore it may not be allowed)
is of no effect; we add, that the Argument negative (if in any thing) then
must it prevail in condemning that Practice, which maintains any new End,
differing from that which was ordained by Christ. Which made Origin and Cyprian
argue Negatively in this Case: the one Christus non distulit, he servari
iussit in crastinum. Orig. Hom. 5. in Levit. Panis iste recipitur, non
includitur. Cyprian. de coena Dom. col 382.
saying, Christ reserved it not till tomorrow: and the other; This bread is
received, and not reserved, or put into a Box. Which Conclusion we may hold,
in condemning of your public Carrying of the Host in the streets and
Marketplaces, to the end only that it may be Adored, as well as (of latter
times) your Pope Pius Quartus (which your Congregation of Sic sanctiss.

Cardinals report) did forbid a new-upstart Custom of Carrying the Sacrament
to sick people, that they might adore it, when as they were not able to eat
it. All these Premises do infer, that your Custom of Circumgestation of the
Sacrament, in public Procession, only for Adoration, cannot justly be called
Laudable, except you mean thereby to have it termed a Laudable Noveltie, and a
Laudable profanation, and Transgression, against the Institution of Christ; as
now from your own Confessions has been plainly evicted: and as will be
further manifested, when we are to speak of your In the seventh Book.
Idolatrous Infatuation it self.

Sense of the words following, [IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME.]

ordained the use of this Sacrament only for persons of Discretion and
Understanding, saying, [DOE THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME.]

Your Jesuit Maldonate will be our Relater, ingenuously confessing, that in
the days of Augustini and Innocentij sententia erat, quae sexcentos Annos in
Ecclesia viguit, Eucharistiam etiam Infantibus necessariam esse: quae ab
Ecclesia iam reiecta, Conc. Trid. statuente, non solu^ non necessarium esse,
sed ne quidem decere Eucharistiam Infantibus dari. Maldo^. Ies. Com. in Ioh. 6.
53. p. 719.
Saint Augustine, and Pope Innocent the first, this opinion was of force in
your Church, For six hundred years together, viz. that the Administration of
the Eucharist is necessary for Infants. Which opinion (says he) is now
rejected by the Council of Trent, Determining that the Eucharist is not only
not necessary for Infants, but also that is Indecent to give it unto them. So
he. Of this more in the Challenge.

CHALLENGE.
IS not now this your Churches Rejecting of her former Practice a Confession
that she has a long time erred in Transgressing of the Institution of Christ?
How then shall your Trent-Fathers free your fore-father Pope Innocent, and your
former Roman Church from this taxation? This they labor to do, but (alas
their misery!) by collusion and cunning: for the same Synod of Sancta Synodus
docet, Parvulos, usu rationis care^tes, nulla obligari necessitate ad
Sacramentalem Eucharistiae co^munionem -- Neque ideo tamen da^nanda est
Antiquitas, si eum morem aliqua^do in quibusdam locis serv^runt, quia certe eos
nulla salutis necessitate fecisse, sine controversia credendum est. Conc. Trid.
Sess. 21. cap. 4.
Trent resolves the point thus; The holy Synod (say they) teaches, that
Children being void of the use of Reason, are not necessarily bound to the
Sacramental receiving of the Eucharist. This we call a collusion; for by the
same Reason, wherewith they argue that Children are not necessarily bound to
receive the Eucharist, because they want reason, they should have concluded,
that Therefore the Church is and was necessarily bound not to administer the
Eucharist to Infants, even because they wanted Reason. Which the Council,
doubtless, knew, but was desirous thus to cover her own shame, touching her
former superstitious practice of Giving this Sacrament unto Infants. In excuse
whereof, your Council of Trent adioyneth, that the Church of Rome, in those
days, was not condemnable; but why? Because (says your See the Testimony
below at the letter (r.)
Council) Truly and without Controversy we ought to believe, that they did
not give the Eucharist unto Infants, as thinking it necessary to Salvation.
Which Answer your own Doctors will prove to be a bold, and a notorious
untruth, because (as your Jesuit Ecclesia tunc adducta fuit Eucharistiam
Infa^tibus dare, argumento sumpto ex verbis Christi, [Nisi manducaueritis
carnem filij hominis, and biberitis sanguinem, non habebitis vitam in vobis]
Maldon. Ies. disp. de Sacram. Tract. de Euch.. Nono, p. ^00. Etiam credebant
Infantes tunc baptizatos, nisi Eucharistiam perciperent, salvos esse non posse.
Idem Com. in Ioh. 6. 63. p. 717.
shows) They then believed that Infants baptized could not be saved, except
they should participate of the Eucharist; taking their Argument from that
Scripture of John 6. [Except you eat the flesh of the Son, etc.] and
therefore held they it necessary to the salvation of Infants.

That this was the belief of Pope Innocent, and of the Church of Rome under
him, your Parisian Doctor Innocent. 1. Romans Pont. Epist. 93. ad Conc. Milevet.
con. Pelag. respondebat, quod parvulos aeternae vitae praemijs, etiam sine

regeneratione defendunt, videntur etiam mihi Baptismu^ cassare velle, cum
praedicant nos habere, quod in eos creditur non nisi Baptismate conferendum.
[Whence Espencaeus thus:] Mirum, ejus temporis Pontifices ex Eucharistiae

out of Bedes Collectanies in 1. Cor. 10. Nulli aliquatenus dubitandum, etc.)
that although the Child do not participate, yet by Baptism he is made
partaker of that which it signifies.]
Espencaeus also proves at large, out of the express writings of Pope
Innocent. Yea, and your greatly approved Binius, in his Volumes of the
Councels, dedicated to Pope Paul the fifth, Binius Tom. 1. Conc. ex Rescriptis

manducaveritis] etc. Quae expositio Praxi Ecclesiae nunc repugnat. [De
Augustini sententia lege ipsum Augustinum, Epist. 106. Col. 148. Edit. Basil

explaineth the same so exactly (See the Marginall Citation) that it will
permit no Evasion. And so much the rather, because that which the Tridentine
Fathers allege, for cause of Alteration, does confirm this unto us: It is
vndocent (say they) to give the Eucharist unto Infants. This may persuade us
that Innocent held it necessary, else would he not have practiced, and
patronized a thing so utterly indecent.

We dispute therefore. If the Church of Rome, in the days of Pope Innocent
the first, held it a doctrine of faith, in the behalf of Infants, that they
ought to receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the same Church of Rome, in
her Council of Trent (whose Decrees by the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth are
all held to be believed upon necessity of Salvation) did decree contrarily that
the participation of the Eucharist is not necessary, no nor yet decent for
Infants. Say now, did the Church of Rome not err in the days of Pope
Innocent? then is she now in an error. Or does she not now err herein? then
did she formerly err, and consequently may err hereafter, in determinining a
matter to be Necessary to Salvation, which in it self is Superfluous and
Indecent. Thus of the contrary custom of the Church of Rome, in elder times.

The new contrary Opinion, concerning the Roman Mass, at this day.

Even at this day also your Jesuit will have us to understand the meaning of
your Church to be, that Non quod Infantes sunt incapaces huius Sacramenti^, sed
quia hoc nunc magis expedit, ad decentiam, and reverentiam, quae aliquali
vtilitati parvulorum praeferenda est. Suarez. Tom. 3. Did. 61. Sect. 3..
Quocirca.
Infants are capable of the Sacrament of the Eucharist.

CHALLENGE.
Whereunto we oppose the Authority of the Conc. Carthag. 3. Eucharistiam
Catechumenis and mortuis dari prohibet, and consequenter pueris, qui utrique
sunt divini illius cibi incapaces, ut quidam ratiocinantur: quia tales non
possint accipere, nec comedere. -- Et Lateranens. Conc. sub Innoc. 3. praecipit
ut tantum, cum ad Annos discretionis pervenerint, Eucharistiam accipiant. --
Quia vero propria and spiritualis manducatio and bibitio est, sine qua

porrigeretur -- Non igitur satis est quod puer possit naturaliter edere, quia
hoc possit trinus and quatrimus praestare: sed opus est ut possit

Council of Carthage, and of that (which you call the) Council of Laterane,
which denied, as you know, that the Eucharist should be delivered unto Infants,
accounting them incapable of divine and spiritual feeding: without which (say
they) the corporal profits nothing. But we also summon, against the ^ormer
Assertion, eight of your ancient And of this opinion were Mayor, Petrus Soto,
Paludanus, Alensis, Gabriel, Catharinus, Dom. de Soto. -- Ratio eorum (says
the same Ies.) quia hoc Sacramentum est cibus spiritualis: Ergo accommodatum

even, we may add also Summa Angel: Tit. Eucharistia.]
Schoolmen, who upon the same Reasons made the like Conclusion with us. And
we further (as it were, arresting you in the Kings name) produce against you
Christ his writ, the Sacred Scripture, whereby he requires in all persons
about to Communicate three principal Acts of Reason; one is before, and two
are at the time of Receiving. The first is 1. Cor. 11.
[(...)] Let a man examine himself, and so come, etc. The second [(...)] To
discern the Lords body. The third is [(...)] To remember the Lords death
until his Coming again. All which Three, being acts of Judgment, how they
may agree unto Infants, being persons void of judgment, judge you. And
remember, we pray you, that we speak of Sacrament all Eating, and not of that
use See above. Sect. 10.
before spoken of touching Eating it after the Celebration of the Sacrament;
which was for Consuming it, and not for Communicating thereof.

CHAP. III.
The Tenth Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass by the now Church of
Rome, is in contradicting the Sense of the next words following (concerning the
second part of this Sacrament of receiving the Cup) [HE LIKEWISE TOOK THE CVP,
AND GAVE IT TO THEM, SAYING, DRINK YE ALL OF THIS.] And adding, 1. Cor. 11.
[DOE THIS, AS OFTEN AS YOU DO IT, IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME.]

SECT. I.
BY which Words [Like manner of Taking, and Giving, and Saying, Drink ye All
of this] we say that Christ ordained for his Guests as well the Sacramental
Rite of Drinking as of Eating; and has tied his Church Catholic in an equal
obligation for performance of both, in the administering of this Sacrament.

This Cause will require a just Treatise, yet so, that our Discourse insist
only upon necessary points, to the end that the extreme Insolency, Noveltie,
Folly, and Obstinacy of the Roman Church, in contradicting of this part of
Christ his Canon, may be plainly displayed; that every conscience of man, which
is not strangely preoccupated with prejudice, or transported with malice, must
needs see and detest it. We have heard of the Canon of Christ his Mass.

The contrary Canon of the Romish Church, in her Mass.

She in her Council of Constance, decreed that Christus sub utraque specie
Discipulis administravit -- Licet in primitiva Ecclesia sub^utraque specie hoc
Sacramentum reciperetur, -- tamen haec consuetudo, ut a Laicis sub specie panis
tantum reciperetur, -- habenda est pro lege, quam non licet reprobare. Conc.
Constant. Sess. 13.
Although Christ, indeed, and the Primive Church did administer the Eucharist
in both kinds; notwithstanding (say they) this Custom of but one kind is held
for a law irreprovable. Which Decree she afterward confirmed in her Ipsa
Synodus, a Spiritu Sancto edocta, and ipsius Ecclesiae iudicium and
consuetudinem secura, declarat and docet, n^llo divino iure Laicos, and
^lericos non consecrantes, obligari ad Eucharistiae Sacramentum sub utraque
specie sumendum: etsi Christas venerabile hoc Sacramentum sub utraque
instituit, and Apostolis tradidit. Conc. Trid. Sess. 21. cap. 1.
Council of Trent, requiring that the former Custom and Law of receiving it
but under one kind be observed both by Laics, yea, and also by those Priests,
who being present at Mass, do not the office of Consecrating. Contrarily our
Church of England in her thirtieth Article thus: Both parts of the Lords
Sacrament, by Christ's Ordinance and Commandment, ought to be ministered to all
Christian men alike.

CHALLENGE.
But we demand; what Conscience should move your late Church of Rome to be
guided by the authority of that former Council of Constance, which
notwithstanding makes no scruple to reject the authority of the same
Respondeo, Fuit reprobarum Conc. Co^stantiense a Martino Pont. quantum ad eam
partem, qua statuit Concilium fuisse supra Papam. Bellar. l 1. de Conc. c. 7..
Quintum.
Council of Constance in another Decree thereof, wherein it gain-sayeth the
Antichristian usurpation of the Pope, by Denying the authority of the Pope to
be above a Council? and that (as the Dixit Petro Christus [Cum frater in te
peccaverit, si ^e non andia^, Dic Ecclesiae.] Ergo Ecclesiam Papae Iudicem
constituit. Conc. Basil. apud Aenaeam Sylvium de gest. eiusdem Conc.
Council of Basil does prove) from the authority of Christ his direction unto
Peter, to whom he said, Tell the Church. We return to the State of the
Question.

The full State of the Question.

All Protestants whether you call them Calvinists, or Lutherans, hold, that in
the public and set celebration of the Eucharist, the Communion in both kinds
ought to be given to all sorts of Communicants, that are capable of both. The
question, thus stated, will cut off a number of Impertinences, which your
Obiectors busy themselves withal, as will appear in due places. We repeat
it again [In public Assemblies of all prepared, and capable of the Communion.]

The best Method, that I could choose, for the expedite and perspicuous
handling of this great Controversy, is by way of Comparison: as, namely,
First, by comparing the Institution of Christ, with the contrary Ordination
and Institution of the Roman Church. Secondly, Christ his Example, with
contrary Examples. Thirdly, the Apostles Practice, with the adverse Practice.
Fourthly, the Primitive Custom of the Church Catholic, with the
after-contrarie Custom; and the Latitude thereof, together with latitude of
the other. Fifthly, the Reasons thereof with Reasons. Sixthly, the diverse manners
of beginning of the one, as also the Dispositions of men therein, with the
repugnant manner and Dispositions of men, in continuing the other.

The discussing of all which points will present unto your view diverse kinds of
Oppositions. In the first is the Conflict of Religion with Sacrilege. In the
second, a sovereign Presidence in Christ, with Contempt. In the third, of
Faithfulness with Faithlesnesse. In the fourth, of Antiquity with Noveltie. In
the fifth, of Universality with Pa^city. In the sixth, of Wisdom, with Folly: as
also of Charity with Injustice and Impiety. In the seventh of Knowledge with
Ignorance; as likewise of Devotion with Profaneness: And all these marching
and warring together, without any possibility of Reconciliation at all.

The first Comparison is of the Institution of Christ with the Contrary:
proving the Precept of Christ, for the use of both kinds to all lawful
Communicants.

SECT. II.
THere is one word twice used in the tenor of Christ his Institution; once
concerning the Bread, [Hoc FACITE] DO THIS:] the second time touching the Cup,
1. Cor. 11. 25. (...)
[Hoc FACITE QVOTIESCVNQVE:] DO THIS AS OFTEN etc.] Both which whosoever
should deny to have the Sound and Sense of a Precept, might be confuted by
your own Jesuits, Doctors, Bishops, and Cardinals, among See all this above
Chap. 2. Sect. 1. in the Margent.
whom we find your Barradas interpreting it, Praecipit: your Valentian,
Praeceptum: your Iansenius, Mandat: your Alan, Praeceptio: your Bellarmine,
Iubet; each one signifying a Command. But of what? this is our next Inquisition.

The Acts of Christ were some belonging to Consecration, and some to
Distribution, Manducation, and Drinking. Such as concerned Consecration of both
kinds, being with common consent acknowledged to be under that Command of [Hoc
facite,] are the Taking Bread, and Blessing it, etc. The other touching
Administration of the Cup, whereof it is said, [Hee took it, and gave it to
his Disciples] whom after he had Commanded, saying [Drinke you all of this:] he
added the other Command set down by Saint Paul, saying unto them, [Doe this as
often as ye shall do it in remembrance of Me.] That by this Obligation he
might charge them to communicate in both kinds. A Precept then it must needs
be, But we are not ignorant of your Evasions.

Your first Evasion.

Although (say Bellar. l. 1. de Eucharist. c. 25. Tertiu^.
you) it be said to his Disciples [Drinke you all, and, Do this] yet it is
spoken to them as they were Priests. And only to the Apostles; says Master M.
Brereley Liturg. Tract. 4. 7. after the let. (y) and after (g.)
Brereley: And again, The Apostles did represent the Priests.

CHALLENGE.
WE answer that your own Quorundam opinio, est Apostolos factos sacerdotes
per illa verba [Hoc facite.] Sed de his verbis non constat facta consecratione
immediate ea dixisse, antequam Eucharistiam sub utraque specie dedit, vel post
-- Quodsi verba ista Christus post datam Eucharistiam illam dixit, manifestum
est, illum non Sacerdotibus hinc dedisse: quod mihi ex literae decursu magis
probatur. Alfon. de Castro con. Haeres. Tit. Eucharist. page 158.
Castro will not allow your Antecedent, but is persuaded rather (by the
manifest Current of the Text) that The Apostles were not Priests when the Cup
was given unto them. And although they were then Priests, yet we answer, that
your Consequence (viz.) Ergo only Priests are enjoined to receive the Cup, will
appear to be both fond in it self, and to your own selves pernicious. First,
as fond, as if one should argue thus: It was at the first said only to the
Apostles, Go and baptize all Nations: Ergo none but the Apostles have Command
to Baptize. Next pernicious, for say (We pray you) do the words, [Drinke ye
all of this] command all Priests to drink? then must this condemn the
contrary See above in this Chapter at the let. (b.)
Practice of your (now Church of Rome, which allows the Cup to no Priest
present, but only to him that does Consecrate: which is directly confuted by
the Example of Christ, who administered the Cup unto all his Apostles, by your
doctrine, Priests.

Again, Do these words only command the Priest to receive the Cup? then
likewise do you condemn your former Church of Rome, which has sometime
permitted the Cup unto Laics. Yea, and your Cardinal Alan [Hoc facite.] Quod
cum pertincat maxim ad potestatem sacerdotalem circa consecrandum and
sacrificandum, tamen Apostolus 1. Cor. 11. refert quoque ad sumptionem sive
Laicorum, sive Sacerdorum. Quod and Cyrillus facit in Ioh. l. 1^. c. 58. Et
Basil. in Moral. Reg. 21. c. (...). ut [Hoc facite] pertineat ad totam
actionem, Eucharistiam a Christo factam, and tam a Presbyteris quam a plebe
postea faciendam. Eodemque verbo imprimis potestas consecrandi and offerendi,
deinde etiam mandatum sumendi tam Sacerdotibus quam alijs fidelibus detur, cum
utrumque suo modo, licet prius exactius Sacrificium, quam sumptio memoriam
mortis Dominicae contineat. Alan. l. 2 de Eucha. cap. 37. p. 646.
does not stick to tell you, out of the ancient Fathers, that the Command [Doe
this] declared by Saint Luke, is applied by Saint Paul to the receiving in both
kinds, as well of People as of Priest.

And by virtue of the same Command of Christ, The Greek Church has always
observed the use of both kinds unto this day. So he, justifying our contrary
Consequence; even as also your Laici adulti tenentur ex institutione Christi
communicare, iure divino: hoc Thomas probat ex Luc. 22. [Hoc facite in
commemorationem mei] quae habent vim praecepti, non tantum de celebrando (ait
Scotus) sed etiam de administrando Sacramentum populo. Cosmus Phil. de offic.
Sacerdot. Tom. 1. de Sacrif. Missae, lib. 2. c. 2.
Cosmus Philiarchus defends, and confirms the same by Aquinas, and Scotus,
the two most eminent Doctors of your Church, holding that Laics are chargible
to celebrate the Eucharist by virtue of the Command of Christ in the same words
of Institution, [Doe this.]

Your second Evasion.
Next, although it were Nec quicquam valetquod obijcitur [Similiter and
Calicem:] quia non dicit Similiter and Calicem dedit, sed solum accepit.
Bellar. ibid.. Nec quicquam.
(say you) said, [And in like manner Christ took the Cup] namely, as he took
Bread: yet the word [Similiter, Likewise] has Relation to his Taking, not to
his Giving.

CHALLENGE.
THis is flatly repugnant to the Gospel of Christ, where these words of Saint
Luke 22. 20.
Luke, [Likewise he took the Cup] appear by Saint Matthew. 26. 27.
Matthew to have relation as well to Christ's Giving, as to his Taking of the
Cup, thus; [Iesus took the Cup and gave thanks, and gave it unto them,
saying, Drink you all of this] Yea and in Saint Luke the text objected is so
clear, that it needs no Comment: He took the Bread, and gave thanks, and
gave it unto them, saying, etc. and likewise the Cup. Where the precedent word,
expressing Christ his Act, is not Took, but Gave the Cup. And if any should
seek a Comment upon these words, he could find none more direct than that of
your learned Arias Montanus, and B. Iansenius, [In like manner.] That (says
Similiter and Calicem.] Id est, Qualia fecit circa panem, talia circa Calicem,
Accepit, gratias egit, dividendum dedit, atque praecepit ut biberent ab co
omnes: Quae omnia Lucas complexus est, dicens, [Similiter and Calicem.] Iansen.

they) as he did with the bread, so did he with the Cup, he took it, he gave
thanks, he gave it unto them All to drink. All which Saint Luke comprised in
these words; [In like manner He took the Cup.] So they.

Your third Evasion.
Although it be said of Drinking of the Cup, [Doe this in remembrance of Me:]
yet the words [Doe this,] say Post panis consecrationem absolute ponitur [Hoc
facite] post Calicem vero idem repetitur, sed cum condition, Hoc (inquit)
facite quotiescunque bibetis, etc. Certe non sine causa Spiritus Sanctus modum
loquendi mutavit, significans, non ut calix debeat dari necessario, sed modum
praescribens, ut id fiat ad memoriam Dominicae Passionis. Bellar. quo sup. cap.
25.. Iam.
you) are spoken absolutely of the Bread, and but Conditionally of the Cup,
namely, [As often as you shall drink it.] And upon this Conceit do two
Jesuits raise up their Insultation, Mirabilis est Dei providentia in sanctis
literis, nam ut non haberent Haeretici justam excusationem, sustulit eis omnem
^ergiversandi occasionem. Nam Lucas [Hoc facite] posuit post datum Sacramentum
sub specie panis: post datum autem Calicem non repetivit, ut intelligeremus
Dominum jussisse, ut sub specie panis omnibus distriburetur: sub specie autem
vini non item. Bellar. quo sup c. 25.. Resp. Mirabilis. Singularis Dei
providentia, ut intelligamus minime expedire, ut singuli fideles sub utraque
specie communicent. Valent. Ies. Tract. de Euch. c. 2.. Et certe, p. 483.
saying; Behold here the wonderful providence of God, whereby is taken from
Heretics all color of excuse. So they, of us Protestants.

CHALLENGE.
TO this we answer, out of the Conclusions of your own Doctors, as well of the
new, as of the old Schools; your Praecepit igitur Christus, in verbis Lucae,
ut ipsa sumptione commemoremus Passionem cius; and non tantum ut quoties illud
sumeremus Passionem ipsius in memoriam revocaremus. Ac proinde praecepit, ut
opere aliquo commemoratio fiat alicujus beneficii accepti, ex modo ipso
praecipiendi. Praecepit etiam ut fiat opus ipsum, quis hoc non videat? Vasquez.
Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 113. cap. 2. At vero non est negandum, esse Praeceptum
simpliciter faciendum, alioquin non haberemus fundamentum Praecepti celebrandi
in Ecclesia. Soto in 4. Did. 12. q. 1. Art. 12.
Jesuit Vasquez, for the new, Concluding, that the words, [This do ye, as
often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me,] as they command the end of the
Celebration of this Sacrament, in the remembrance of the Passion of Christ: so
do they also command the Act and manner thereof, which is, by drinking of the
Sacramental Cup. Which he holds to be so manifest a Truth, that he
thinks no man to be so blind, as not to discern it, saying, Who sees not
this? Accordingly he alleges Soto for the old School, concluding that the
words [Drinke ye all of this, as often, etc.] Do simply command the act of
Drinking: or else (says he) the Church has no ground, for the Priest that
consecrateth, to celebrate in both kinds. And this Obligation Cardinal
Credimus eos recte obligari, dum militamus in hac vita, ad Sacramentum
Eucharistiae, eo modo, quo perfectius significat Passionem: id est, sub utraque
specie, etc. Card. Cusan. Epist. 2. ad Bohem. page 831.
Cusanus affirms to lie always upon the Church; Whereby your Master [Who in
his Book of the Liturgy of the Mass, stadeth so much upon the no-Command of
Christ for the use of both kinds, that he justifies an ancient Roman Custom
(as he calls it) of the Priest himself receiving on Good Friday only under
one kind.] Tract. (...) Sect. 4. page 407. And Tract. 4. Sect. 7. page 421. [As
often:] not signifying the necessity of Drinking.
Brereley may see, and acknowledge his double Error.

And, indeed, the Evidence is so great, that although all Romish Universities
should withstand it, we might herein appeal to common Sense: for Christ having
first commanded his Disciples, saying, in the Celebration of this Sacrament,
[Drinke ye all of this;] this is the Act: and adding further, saying, [As
often, or whenever as ye shall drink it, do this in remembrance of me,]
Which is the End so commanded; it does equally imply command of the Act of
Drinking, as well as of the End. Now the Catholic Church did always hold, that
there ought to be an Often Commemoration of the Passion of Christ even until
his coming again (as says the Apostle) by the Celebration of this Sacrament.
And the word [(...)] As often, and when-soever ye receive, etc. (being
indefinite, and assigning no certain days or times) gives liberty to the
Church to solemnize this Memorial at her convenient times; yet so, that
Whenever the Church celebrateth this Sacrament, she do it according to the
form of Christ his Institution, by Communicating in both kinds.

If the Pope, sitting in the Assembly of his Cardinals, delivering unto each of
them a Ring, to put upon their thumbes, should say, Do this as often as you
come before me, in testimony of my love: We demand, Are they not, as often as
they come into the presence of that Pope, chargeable to put on each one his
Ring upon his thumb, by virtue of the Popes Command, [Doe this?] who sees not
this, that does not wilfully blindfold and stupifie his wits? Shall we
conclude? As your own Doctors infer from these words of Christ [Doe this]
that Laics, who be of years, are bound by the Law of God to communicate: By
the same Text may we conclude, that they are likewise obliged to participate
of the Cup.

THE CHALLENGE, In General.

Do this] are (as you have heard) words Commandatorie, and being spoken of
both kinds, as well for Consecration, as for Distribution, do oblige the Church
of Christ to perform both kinds: so that it must needs follow, that the
neglect of the Act is a Transgression of the Precept of Christ. And so much the
rather ought you to be persuaded hereof, because your choicest and most subtle
Objecters, when, seeking to defend your Alteration, it became them to reason
discreetly concerning this Sacrament (which the Fathers call [(...),] the Cup
of Sobriety) yet do argue so intemperately, as though they had been
over-taken with some other Cup: insomuch that they are confuted by their own
learned fellows, by evident texts of the Evangelists, and by common sense;
which gives us just cause to turn their Wonderment against themselves,
saying, Behold the providence of God! thus plainly to confound the wisdom of
the Adversaries of his truth by themselves, in their greatest subtilenesse.
Hitherto of the Comparison of the Ordinance of Christ with the Ordinance of the
Romish Church.

Our second Comparison is of the Example of Christ, with the contrary Example.

SECT. III.
Were it that we had no Precept of Christ to [Doe this] but only the Example
of his Doing it in the first Institution, this should be a Rule for us to
observe it punctually, excepting in such Circumstances, which only occasionally
and accidentally happened therein, as See above Sect. 2
has been proved; and therefore not to dare to give a Non-obstante, against
the Example of Christ, as your See above in this Chapter Sect. 1. lit. (a.)
Council of Constance has done: and which Recte docent Iurisco^sulti, non
exemplis sed legibus iudicandum. -- Quae ab exemplis ducuntur argume^ta per
locum sunt a simili (quae non tam ad aliquid firmandum, quam ad id quod
firmatur illustrandum a Dialecticis esse traduntur.) Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9.
Tract. 34.
your Jesuit also teaches, as if the Example of Christ were no argument of
proof at all. Which Doctrine we are now to try by the judgment of
Antiquity. Cyprian. con. Aquarios Epist. 63. Admonitos nos scias, ut in Calice
offerendo traditio observetur, neque aliquid fiat a nobis, quam quod pro Nobis
Dominus prior fecerit. [And somewhat after;] A divino Magisterio non recedamus.
Cyprian confuteth the Aquarij (Heretics that used only Water in the Chalice)
by the Example of Christ his Institution, because Nothing is to be done of us,
in celebrating of this Mystery, which was not done of Christ. So he.

In the days of Pope Julius, Anno 337. there arose many giddie spirits, which
violated the holy Institution of Christ in this Sacrament, when as some
consecrated Milk instead of Wine: others sopped the bread in the Cup: a third
sort squiezed Grapes thereinto. These, and the like, that holy Pope did
condemn, but how? by pretense of Custom only? no, but by the obligation of
Christ his Example, and institution of this Sacrament, in these words
following: Julius P. apud Gratian. de Consecrat. Ca. Cum omne. Audivimus
quosdam, Schismatica ambitione detentos, contra divinos ordines and Apostolicas
institutiones, lac provino, in divinis officijs dedicare: alios intinctam
Eucharistiam populo pro complemento communionis porrigere: quosdam etiam
expressum vinum in Sacramento Dominici Calicis afferre: Alijs vero pannum
lineum, musto intinctum, per totum annum reservare, and in tempore Sacrificij
partem eius aqualavare, and sic offerre. Quod cum sit Evangelicae and
Apostolicae doctrinae contrarium, and consuetudini Ecclesiasticae adversum, non
difficile ab ipso font veritatis probatur, a quo ordinata ipsa Sacramentorum
mysteria processerunt. Cum onim Magister veritatis verum salutis nostrae
Sacrificium suis commendaret Discipulis, nulli lac, sed panem tantum and
Calicem sub hoc Sacramento noscimus dedisse. Legitur enim in Evangelica
veritate, [Accepit Jesus Panem and Calicem, and benedicens dixit Discipulis
suis.] Cesset igitur Lac in sacrificando offerri, quia manifestum and evidens
veritatis exemplum illuxit, quia praeter Panem and Vinum aliud offerri non
licet. Illud vero quod pro complemento Communionis, intinctam Eucharistiam
tradunt populis, nec hoc prolatum ex Evangelio testimonium receperunt, ubi
corpus suum Apostolis commendaret and sanguinem: scorsim enim panis, and
seorsim Calicis commendatio memoratur.
Because these are contrary (says he) to Evangelicall and Apostolical
doctrine, and Ecclesiastical Custom, as is easily proved from the fountain
of truth, from whence the Sacraments had their first ordinance; for when our
Master of Truth commended this to his Disciples, he gave to none Milk, but
Bread only, and the Cup. Nor does the Gospel mention the sopping of bread, but
of giving Bread apart, and the Cup also apart, etc. So Pope Julius. Those
also that offered Bread and Cheese together, in this Sacrament, are confuted by
the Institution of Christ, who appointed Bread, says Artotyritae pane^ and
caseum offerunt: qui excluduntur per hoc, quod Christus hoc Sacramentum
instituit in pane. Aquinas part. 3. quaest. 24. Art. 1.
your Aquinas. What can be more direct and absolute? yet dare your men object
to the contrary.

The Romish Objection answered.

At Emmaus, Luke 24. Christ, meeting with certain Disciples, taking bread and
blessing it, and thereby manifesting himself to them, is said immediately
after the Breaking of Bread to have vanished out of their sights. Ergo, it may
be lawful (says your Ex Luc. 24. 30. Vbi Christus apparens duobus Discipulis
in Emmaus, and accumbens accepit panem, and benedixit, and dedit eis: quo
facto, aperti sunt oculi eorum, and evanuit ex oculis, etc. [Hence does
Bellarmine conclude thus:] Ostendi^. hoc exemplum, quod minime existimandum
fit, fuiffe imperatum omnibus illius usum in utraque specie. Bellar. l. 4. de
Euch. c. 24.. Rursus, So also Roffensis, and others.
Cardinal) to use but one kind. Because (says Master Brereley Liturg. Tract.
4.. 3. page 402.
Master Brereley) the Text shows, that Christ vanished away, not leaving any
time for Benediction, or Consecration of the Cup.

CHALLENGE.
THis Argument is still inculcated, almost, by every Romanist, in defense of
the Romish Custom of but in one kind, notwithstanding it be twice rotten.
First, in the Root and Antecedent: For although Christ here had begun the
Celebration of the Eucharist, yet does it not appear that he did now perfect
it, in distributing either kind to his Disciples, Nor is this likely, says
your Christum hanc Eucharistiam porrexisse, sententia est incerra, and non
verisimilis. Iansen. Concord. cap. 126. pa. ^070.
Iansenius. And it is dead-rotten also in the branch and Consequence thereof,
because that this Act of Christ in Emmaus is not to be urged as an Example, to
be imitated in the Church; which is demonstrable by an Acknowledgement of your
Jesuit Respondendum est, eam actionem esse illis ipsis imperatam per illa
verba [Hoc facite.] Hoc ipso enim quod jussi sunt consecrare sub specie panis,
consequenter intelligi debet eos jussos esse consecrare sub specie vini. Nam
hoc exigit necessario natura Sacrificij and Sacramenti: si enim una species

Valentia. As for example. The Council of Trent has defined that the Priest,
in Consecrating, is commanded by Christ his Institution to consecrate in both
kinds; Because this (says your Jesuit) both the nature of the Sacrifice and
Sacrament does exact: but by what words of Command? namely (for so he says)
by these words, [Doe this.] Accordingly your Objectour Liturg. Tract. 4.. 2.
page 401.
Master Brereley (as if he had meant purposely to confute, and confound
himself) The reason why the Priest receives both kinds, is because he is to
represent the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross. But Bread cannot represent
Christ dead, without some sign of Blood.

If then, because Christ ministered it not in both kinds in Emmaus, it shall be
lawful for the Church to imitate him in that manner of Distribution of this
Sacrament, it must as equally follow, that because he is not found there to
have Consecrated in both kinds, it may be lawful for your Church so to do;
not only contrary to your now Roman Custom, but also (in the judgment of the
Council of Trent) contrary to the Command of Christ, as See above.
has been confessed. Twice miserable therefore is the darkness of your
Disputers, First, not to see the Inconsequence of this Objection: and next not
to remember that common Principle, to wit, Extraordinary Acts are not to be
Rules for ordinary Duties.

A SECOND CHALLENGE.
We conclude. You have seen by the testimonies of Cyprian, and Pope Julius,
that it was good Divinity, in their days, to argue from the Example of Christ
his Institution negatively; by rejecting such Acts, and accounting them as
contrary to the Institution of Christ, which accord not with his Example, and
which are not comprised within the Canon of Christ his [Hoc facite.] which
kind of Reasoning, at this day, is ^issed at in your Romish Schools. What
need many words? O tempora!

Our third Comparison is, by conferring Apostolical Practice with contrary
Practice.

SECT. IV.
SAint Paul having more special occasion to handle this point, than any other
of the Apostles, may worthily be admitted to resolve us in the name of all the
Rest. He Catechizing the Corinthians, concerning the true use of the
Eucharist, records the first Institution thus: 1. Cor. 11. 23.
I have received of the Lord that which I deliver unto you, that the Lord
Jesus, etc. And, after his Recital of the Institution of Christ, he himself
adds [ Ib. Verse 26.
As often as you eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, you show the Lords
death until he come again. Ib. Verse 28.
Let therefore a man examine himself, and so eat of this Bread, and drink of
this Cup.] From this we seek a Proof both of the Apostolical Practice, in
the use of both kinds in this Sacrament; and of our duty in observing the
same. But we may spare our pains of prooving the use of both kinds in the
Church of Corinth, because (as your Antiqua Consuetudo temporibus Apostolorum
fuit in Ecclesia, sub utraque specio communicandi. In hac assertione nulla est
Controversia. Tolet. Ies. in Ioh. 6. page 602. So Ecchius Hom. 36. Nullum
inficiari posse, Paulum hoc praecepisse Corinthijs.
Cardinal Tolet confesses) There is no controversy thereof.

As for the proof of our necessary Conformity, we have the same Reasons,
wherewith the Apostle persuades thereunto, [That (says he) which I have
received of the Lord, I deliver unto you, that Jesus, etc.] Thereby applying
the Example of Christ his Institution for a Rule of their Practice: which this
coniunctive Particle of Eating [AND] Drinking; To Eat [AND] Drink, five times
so coupled in this Epistle, do plainly declare.

But you tell us, that in this place the Coniunctive [AND] is is put for a
disiunctive Or, thereby to teach the Church a liberty to choose whether they
shall Eat or Drink: notwithstanding, you your selves have confessed that
Christ spoke absolutely, and without Condition, of the Bread, Take, Eat, Do
this. And again, 1. Cor. 11. 24. [(...), And in like manner the cup.] It is an
AND Coniunctive, questionless. But seeing it cannot be denied, that the
Apostles practice was both Eating and Drinking coniunctively, it is not likely
or credible that the sense of his words should be discretiue; because this had
been, in words, to have contradicted his own practice. M. Breerly opposes,
viz. The Apostle in the same Chapter says v. 26. He that eats and drinks
unworthily eats and drinks Judgment; also he says v. 27. whosoever
eats this Bread, and drinks this Cup unworthily, etc. So he. It is not to
be denied but that [AND] is often used in Scripture for Or: but M. Brearly his
notions, as commonly, so here also are too confused, by not distinguishing the
diverse use of [AND] in Precepts, and Exhortations to an Act, in denunciation of
judgment, in case of Transgression. As for example, The Precept is, Honor thy
father and thy mother, (Exodus 20.) here [AND] must needs be copulative, because
of the Obligation of precept of honoring both. But the denunciation against
the Transgressour, if it stood (as M. Breerly obiecteth, feigning a false Text
contrary both to the Original, and vulgar Latin Translation) thus, He that
shall strike his father, and mother shall die: the particle [AND] must needs be
taken disiunctively for Or, (as indeed it is expressed in the Text) because the
Transgression of either parts of a Commandment infers an obligation of
guilt and judgment, as any man of sense may perceive.

Against this, albeit so evident a Truth, your Doctors will have something to
obect, or else it will go hard; even forsooth the contrary practice of the
Apostles, Act. 2. 42. where we read of the faithful assembled and Continuing
together in fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers; because there
is but mention only of one kind, which is Bread: whence they infer a
no-necessity of using the Cup. So your Act. 2. Ita describitur communicatio
Eucharistiae [Erant enim perseverantes in doctrina Apostolorum, and
communicatione fractionis panis, and Orationibus.] Quo in loco negari non
potest quin agatur de Eucharistia. Apostoli igitur in utraque specie
consecrabant: sed populis in una specie ministrabant. Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. c.
24. p. 64.
Cardinal Bellarmine. And to answer that the ministration of the Cup is
understood by a figure Synecdoche, is an answer only imaginary and groundles,
says Liturg. Tract. 4.. 3. page 403.
Mr. Breerely. But are they yet to learn that which every man knows, and
your own Jesuits have taught? that there is no Trope more familiar in
Scripture than this Sy^echdoche of taking a part for the whole? Or could they
not discern thus much in the same Chap. (...). 46. where it is said, They
brake bread through every house; Wherein (as your Jesuit Existimo de
Eucharistia non esse Sermonem, quoniam de illo superius paulo Sermo habitus
est. Lorin. Ies. in eund. loc. And Caietan. Card. Fiebat distributio panis --
Ita quod accipiebant cibus erat. Comment in eund. loc.
Lorinus teaches) there is not meant the Eucharist, but common food? Whereby
you cannot but understand implied in their breaking of bread their mutual
drinking together also. And yet in the like words spoken of the Eucharist, v.
42. [They continued together in breaking of Bread] you exclude the
participation of the Cup. What shall we say? was your spiritual appetite
weaker than your corporal, in reading these two Texts, wherein is mentioned
only Bread, that you could discern but half refection in the Eucharist, and
an whole in their bodily repast? Besides, any man may guess what spirit it
savoureth of, that (in paralleling the authority of your Church with the
authority of the Apostles) your Jesuits do resolve, that although the
Apostles had constituted the custom of Receiving in both kinds, Si daremus
hunc ritum ab Apostolo fuisse traditum, cum tamen mere positivus sit, potuisset
illum mutare, quia Ecclesia habet eundem spiritum, and eandem authoritatem cum
Paulo. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34. p. 277. Eod^m modo Vasquez Ies. in 3.
Thom. Disp. 215, 216. Nihilo minus Ecclesia and summus Pontifex poterit illud
just is de causis abrogare; licet concederemus praeceptum hoc fuisse
Apostolicum.
Nevertheles (say they) the Church of Rome, and Pope thereof, having the same
authority with S. Paul, may abrogate it upon just Cause. And yet hardly can you
allege any Cause, for abrogation of that Practice, which S. Paul might not
have assumed in his time.

CHALLENGE.
OFrustra susceptos Labores nostros! may we say; for to what end is it for us
to prove an Apostolical Practice, or Precept for both kinds, when your
Obiectors are ready with the only names of Pope and Church of Rome to stop
the mouths not only of us Heretics (as you call us) but even of S. Paul
himself, and of the other Apostles, yea and of S. Peter too? By which Answer
notwithstanding you may perceive how little S. Paul does favor your cause, by
whose Doctrine the Advocates for your Church are driven to these straits: but
more principally if you call to remembrance, that our Argument is taken from
the Apostles Doctrine and Practice, as it was grounded by St. Paul himself
upon the Doctrine and Precept of Christ. Thus, when we appeal unto the
Apostles Tradition, you, by opposing, Think your selves wiser than the
Apostles: which Irenaeus will tell you was the very garb of old Cum ad eam
Traditionem, quae ab Apostolis, provocamus eos, dicent se Apostolis existentes
superiores sinceram invenisse veritatem. Iren. lib. 2. advers. Hi^res. cap. 2.
Heretics.

Our fourth and fifth Comparisons are of Primitive Custom with the contrary
Custom; in respect both of the Antiquity and Universality thereof.

SECT. V.
BEfore we shall say any thing our selves of the Primitive Custom, in using
both kinds in the administration of this Sacrament, and the extent thereof,
both in the longitude of Continuance, and latitude of Universality, we are
ready to hear how far your own Doctors will yield unto us, in both these
points, touching the public use of both kinds. Hearken but unto the
Marginals, and you shall find your Jesuits, with others, uttering these
voices: Olim per multa secula sub utraque specie porrigibatur Laicis, ut ex

be made of Gregory the first Pope of that name, his testimony is cited in
Gratian among the Popes Decrees. De Consecrat. Did. 2. Quid sit sanguis.
Sanguis in ora fid elium funditur.]
We must confess, We do confess; yea, We do ingenuously confess a
Custom of both kinds (as well to the Laics as Priests) to have been in the
Primitive Church most frequent and general: as is prooved by the ancient
Fathers both Greek and Latin, among whom are Leo and Gregory (both) Popes of
Rome; yea and universal also for a long time, continuing a thousand years in
the Church of Rome, and in the Greek Church unto this day. So they. where we
see both Antiquity and Universality thereof to the full, which it were easy
for us to have shown Gradatim, descending down from the first Age unto the
twelfth; but that when we have as much confessed as need be proved, it might
be judged to be but an importunate diligence and Curiosity to labor any
further. Nevertheless, if peradventure any should desire to see one or two
Testimonies for the last Age, he may satisfy himself in the Bern. Sermon. 3. de
ramis palmarum, de Sacrament. corp. and sanguinis Dom. -- Nemo est qui nesciat

Margent at the first sight.

The Romish Objections, concerning Primitive Custom.

Diverse Objections are urged on your side, to abate something of the
Universality of the Custom of Both kinds, which we defend; but if they shall
not seek to decline the Question, and to rove about, as it were, at unset
marks, their Arguments are but as so many Bolts shot altogether in vain. For
our defense is only this, that in the public solemnization and Celebration of
this Sacrament, in an Assembly of Christians freely met to communicate, no one
example can be shown in all Antiquity, throughout the Catholic Church of
Christ, for the space of a thousand years, inhibiting either Priest, or Laick,
from Communicating in both kinds, who was duly prepared to receive the
Sacrament. As for the examples which you usually object, they are of no force
at all, being Ob: Consuetudinem Eucharistiam domum deferendi, etc. Sol. [By
reason of Persecution, and the paucitie of Ministers: but afterward abolished
by the Church as was the ministration thereof to Infants.] Ob: [Communio olim
Laicis data in poenam gravis delicti. Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. cap. 24. [Sol. As
if the punishment of the Laics Communion could signify Partaking in one
kind.] which is confuted by Durant. lib. 2. de Ritib. cap. 55. Nonnulli

imo Sacerdotes ipsi non conficientes communicant, nunc sub una specie. Quare
verius est, Laicam communionem dictam, quia extra sacratiorem locum, ubi
Sacrificium fit, ubi Sacerdos conficiens, tum Ministri communicabant. And by
Pamelius in Cyprian. Epist. 152. Laicum communicare, nihil aliud est quam inter
Laicos. i. e. extra cancellos -- hoc est, extra chorum, ut hodie loquimur.

proved to be either private, or illegitimate, or false, respectively. Hitherto
of the Primitive Custom. Notwithstanding all this, will your Roman Church
boast of her contrary Custom of aftertimes; telling us in her Councels that
her Custom of administering the Eucharist but in one kind is rightly observed,
as a Custom which has been Diutissime observata, that is, of most long
continuance: Many years by passed, says In Conc. Constant. de usu unius
speciei. Cum huiusmodi consuetudo ab Ecclesia and sanctis patribus
rationabiliter introducta, and hactenus diutissime observata sit, habenda est
pro lege. Eodem modo Conc. Basil. pene eisdem verbis: Deinde latam legem

apud Act. Conc. Trident. p 220, 222, 223.
your Villalpandius: But most precisely your Jesuit Secundum certum est,
Ecclesiam praesentem, and quae illam praecessit per trecentos aut ducentos
annos, Laicos sub altera specie in multis Ecclesijs communicare consuevisse, ut
docet S. Thomas in Ioh. his verbis. Secundum antiquae Ecclesiae consuetudinem
omnes sicut communicabant corpore, ita and sanguine: quod etiam adhuc in
quibusdam Ecclesijs servatur, ubi etiam Ministri altaris continuo and corpore
and sanguine communicabant. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 35.. Secundum certum.
page 284.
Salmeron: It is certain (says he) that the Church, for these three or two
hundred years, has used to communicate to the Laity under one kind. So they.

CHALLENGE.
NOw after that we have proved, out of your own Confessions, the length of
the Custom of both kinds to have been in the Continuance above a thousand
years, after the first Institution of this Sacrament, and for largenes
thereof, in an universal consent thereunto, without any exception by any
example ordinary, public, and legitimate; and that you have heard also even
the Fathers of your Church opposing against it a contrary custom not above the
Compass of three hundred years, and yet to call it [Diutissima] A Custom of
long continuance; What Tergiversation could be more shameless? But enough of
this point. In the next place, because the same your Council has told us,
that your Contrary Custom was brought in [Rationabiliter,] with good Reason,
we are forthwith to discuss the Reasons thereof.

Our sixth Comparison is of Reasons, for the Use of both kinds, collated with
Reasons objected to the contrary.

SECT. VI.
A Sacrament (according to the common definition) is a Visible sign of an
invisible Grace; and so far is a Sign true and perfect, as it does fully
represent the things that are ordained to be signified thereby: Signification
being the very proper nature and end of a sign, as well in sacred, as in
profane Rites. Come now and let us industriously and calmly debate this
matter, which we have in hand, both in respect of the thing signified (which
is the Sacrament, or spiritual Object) as of the party Communicating, who is
the Subject thereof.

Our first Reason is taken from the due Perfection of this Sacrament, which
must necessarily be in both kinds.

The things Spiritual (as all Christians profess) are the Body and Blood of
Christ, which are signified in the Sacrament of Bread and wine; These two then
are not two Sacraments, but one Sacrament, (as you know) which therefore ought
to be performed in both, or else the Act will be a Sacrilegious dismembring of
the Sacrament of Christ. This shall we easily prove from the Principles and
Confessions of your own Schools. Your Church professes to celebrate the
Eucharist, both as it is a Sacrifice, and as it is a Sacrament. As you hold it
to be a Sacrifice, you generaly teach that both kinds are necessarily to be
received of the Priest, because they both belong to the Essence thereof. So
your Sed nos nullam scimus Sacramenti multilationem, neque partem dimidiam
Laicis esse substractam, siquidem duae species requiruntur necessario ad
Sacrificium, sed ad essentiam Sacramenti quae. libet ex duobus sufficit. --

significat, species vini solum sanguinem repraesentat, illiusque solius

vsu Euch. c. 6.. Etenim. page 492. Respondendum est, eam actionem esse illis
ipsis imperatam perilla verba [Hoc facite, etc. See above Sect. 3. at (g) where
Vasquez the Ies. is cited in 3: Thom. disp. 215.
Aquinas, your Jesuits Valentia, and Vasques, and they will say as much in
behalf of the Eucharist, as it is a Sacrament; their reason is, Because both
kinds, making but one Sacrament, ought to be celebrated perfectly, and
therefore is the Priest bound to consecrate this Sacrament in both kinds by
that command of Christ, saying, [Do this:] nor can this be omitted without
Sacrilege. So they.

If such be the necessity of consecrating in both kinds under the hand of the
Priest, then lies the same obligation upon the Church likewise, for
distributing it in both kinds unto the people, to whom it is to be
administered, in token of Christ his Passion for them applicatorily, both in his
Body and Blood: but the Bread only can no more represent the Blood of Christ in
the mouths of people, in the eating thereof, then it can by Consecrating it in
the hands of the Priest: and consequently the dismembring thereof, as you do,
must necessarily condemn both Priest and People. A Consequence, which your
figment of See hereafter, Sect. 8.
Concomitancie cannot possibly avoid.

A Corroboration of the same Reason, against the Sacrilegious dismembring of
this Sacrament, by the Testimony of Pope Gelasius; and a Vindication of Dr.
Morton, from the Traducement of other your Priests and Jesuits.

SECT. VII.
THe Haereticall Manichees forbear the use of the Cup in this Sacrament, in an
opinion, that wine was not created by God, but by some evil spirit; whom Pope
Gelasius did therefore condemn by his public Decree: which heretical opinion
(as once I Appeal. lib. 2. Chap. 1. page 140.
said) cannot justly be imputed unto the Church of Rome, in her manner of
abstaining from the Cup in the Eucharist. This saying In his Answer to his
Majesty.
M. Fisher the Jesuit, of late, thought good to pervert to his own use, thus.
The Crime wherewith some Protestants charge us, that our receiving under the
sole form of Bread is to iump in the opinion of the Manichees, we may (as D.
Morton confesses) reject as injurious, saying with him, that it was not the
Manichees abstinence from wine, but the reason of their forbearance that was
judged heretical. So he. But this man's march is but slow.

M. Breerly, a Romish Priest, one well esteemed among you, for his (p) In his
Book of the Liturgy of the Mass, Tract. 4.. 4. page 407.
exceeding labor and pains in defending the Romish Cause, to his power; by his
many Books, almost in every particular, comes on more roundly, as follows:
D. Morton himself (says he) shall plead in our behalf, who says that the
Manichees did heretically celebrate the Eucharist only in one kind, in an
opinion that wine was not created by God, but by some evil spirit, and were
therefore anciently condemned for Heretics: but the Romanists are not to be
accused of this Heresy of the Manichees, in their not distributing of both
elements of bread and wine. And to object this against that Church were an
accusation injurious, for it was not the Manichees abstinence from wine, but
their reason thereof which made them heretical, said he. So your Priest; yet
what of all this? So clearly does D. Morton (says he) clear us from the foul
and false imputation urged against us by D. Whitaker, who noted the
Administration but in one kind, now used by the Romish Church, to have had it is
original from the Manichees: and so clearly does he contradict both M.
Whitaker and himself, in one place accusing us, in another excusing us, in one
and the same Respect: of which foul fault of Contradiction in so great a
Rabbin when he cleereth himself, in stead of being Bishop of Litch field, he
shall be unto me ever Magnus Apollo. Thus far M. Breerly. Alas! what will become
of the Doctor, being, as you see, thus fiercely assaulted by two at once, one a
Jesuit, the other a Romish Priest, both conspiring together to make the Doctor
ridiculous?

CHALLENGE.
IT is now about twenty years since the said Doctor (in Confutation of a Book
of Master Brereleys, entitled an Apology) published a Treatise, called the
Protestants Appeal, wherein were discovered many hundred of Master Brereleyes
Ignorances, Falsities, and Absurdities: who ever since has had Master Parson's
itch, (as he himself called his own humor) which received a Salve that
might have cured him of that itch, to be meddling with the same Doctor. Yet the
only Exception, which has since come to this Doctor's ears from your side,
is this now objected point, concerning the Manichees: whereupon you have heard
them both so urgently, and boastingly insist, and not so only, but they have
also divulged this pretended Contradiction in many Counties of this Kingdom,
to his reproach. Will you be so kind, as but to hear an Answer, and then
either wonder at, or hiss, or applaude, or him, or them, as you shall find
just Cause.

Two things there were condemnable in the Manichees, one was their Act and
Practice, in dismembring the Sacrament, by not communicating in both kinds:
the other was their Opinion, which they held, for so doing; which was, as you
have heard, an heretical Conceit that Wine was the Creature of the Devil.
Concerning this heretical opinion, no Protestant (said Protestants Appeal,
lib. 2. Chapter 4. Sect. 3.
Doctor Morton) does charge the Church of Rome: but as for the Act of not-
Communicating in both kinds, In the same Appeal, lib. 4. Chapter 22. Sect. 10.
he called it Sacrilegious, and concluded the Church of Rome, in this respect,
to be as guilty of dismembring the Sacrament, as were the Manichees. And both
these he has done by the Authority of Pope Co^perimus quod quidam, sumpta
tan^ummodo corporis sacri portione, a Calice sacri cruoris abstineant: qui
proculdubio (quoniam nescio qua superstitione doce^tur astringi) aut Sacramenta
integra percipia^t, aut ab integris arceantur, quia divisio unius ejusdemque
mysterii sine gra^di sacrilegio non potest provenire. Gelas. apud Gratia^. de
Consecrat. cap. Comperimu^. D. 2.
Gelasius, who decreed, in condemning the Manichees, First against their
Opinion, saying, Illinescio qua superstitione docentur astringi, etc. (That is)
They are entangled in a kind of Superstition. Then, for the Act of refusing the
Cup, Because (says he) the dividing of the same Mystery cannot be done without
grievous sacrilege, therefore let these Manichees either receive the whole
Sacrament, or else let them be wholly excluded from receiving. So Gelasius.

Seeing then Doctor Morton, and all Protestants, clear the Church of Rome from
the imputation of the Heresy of the Manichees, in respect of their opinion,
and yet condemn them of the Manichean Sacrilege, in respect of the Act of
dismembring the Sacrament; with what spectacles (think you) did your Priest
and Jesuit read that Answer of Doctor Morton, to collect from thence, either
your Churches Justification from a foul fault of Sacrilege, or else the
Doctors foul Contradiction to himself, and that clearly forsooth, in the
same respect? who themselves are now found to have been so subtly witless,
as not to discern Heresy from Sacrilege; an opinion from a fact; or a
no-imputation of that, whereof neither Doctor Whitaker, nor any other
Protestant ever accused them, from a practice condemned by a Roman Pope
himself. Take unto you a Similitude. A man being apprehended in the company of
Traitors, upon suspicion of Felony, is fully and effectually prosecuted for
Felony only; if one should say of him, that he was not convicted or condemned
of Treason, but of Felony, were this either a Contradiction in the party
speaking, or a full Justification of the party spoken of?

You are by this time (we think) ashamed of your Proctors, and of their
scornful insultation upon the Doctor, in the ridiculous terms of Rabbin,
and magnus Apollo: who willingly forbeareth, upon this Advantage, to recompense
them with like scurrility, being desirous to be only Great in that, which is
called Magna est Veritas, and praevalet.

By which Truth also is fully discovered the vanity of the Answer both of
Master Fisher, and of your Cardinal, saying, that Gelasius condemned only the
Opinion of the Manichees; which is so transparant a falsehood, as any one that
has but a glympse of Reason may see through it, by the sentence it self, as
has been proved.

Our second Reason is in respect of the perfect Spiritual Refection,
represented by this Sacrament.

SECT. VIII.
ANother Object, represented in this Sacrament, is the food of man's soul, in
his faithful receiving of the Body and Blood of Christ, which because it is a
perfect spiritual Refection, Christ would have it to be expressed both in
Eating and Drinking, wherein consists the perfection of man's bodily
sustenance: and therefore are both necessarily to be used, by law of Analogy
between the outward sign and the thing signified thereby. Two of your Nam in
alterutra specie sive panis sive vini significatur sufficienter refectio
animae. Bellar. l. 4. de Eucharist. c. 22.. Vtraque p. 639. Est etiam in specie
qualibet tota significatio refectionis spiritualis -- quia unam and eandem
refectionis gratiam spiritualem significat cibus and potus. Valent. quo sup. de
legit. usu Euch. p. 491.
Jesuits (from whom Master Fisher has learned his Answer) seek to persuade
their Readers, that the souls refection spiritual is sufficiently signified
in either kind, whether in Bread, or Wine. But be it known unto you, that
either all these have forgotten their Catechism, authorized by the Fathers of
the Council of Trent, and confirmed by Pius Quartus then Pope, or else Those
their Catechists forgot themselves in teaching, that Optimo iure institutum est
ut separatim duae consecrationes fierent: primo enim ut Passio Domini, in qua
sanguis a corpore divi^us est, magis referatur -- Deinde, maxim consentaneum
suit, ut quoniam Sacramento, ad alendam animam, utendum nobis erat, tanquam
cibus and potus instituetetur, ex qui^us perfectum corporis alimentum constare,
perspicuum est. Catechis. Romans part. 2. de ^uch. number 29.
This Sacrament was instituted so; that two several Consecrations should be
used, one of Bread, and the other of the Cup; to the end both that the Passion
of Christ might be represented, wherein his Blood was separated from his Body,
and because this Sacrament is ordained to nourish man's soul, it was therefore
to be done by Eating and Drinking; in both which the perfect nourishment of
man's natural life does consist.

Aquinas, and your Jesuit Valentia with others are as express in this point,
as they were in the former; who although they (as we also) hold that whole
Christ is received in either kind, (for Christ is not divided) yet do they
Hoc Sacramentum ordiratur ad spir^tualem refectionem, quae conformatur
corporali. Ad corporalem autem refectionem Duo requiruntur, scilicet cibus, qui
est almentu^ si^cum, and potus, qui est alimentum humidum. Et etiam ad
integritatem hu^us Sacramenti duo concurrunt, scilicet, spiricualis cibus, and
spiritualis potus, s^cundu^ illud, Ioh. 6. [Caro mea vere est cibus.] -- Ergo
hoc Sacramentum multa quide^ est materialiter, sed unum formaliter and
perfective. Aquin. par. 3. qu. 73. Art. 2. Etsi negandum non est quin eius
refectionis spiritualis vis and commoditas clarius utraque resimul, scilicet
cibo and potu, atque adeo utraque specie significetur: ideo enim hoc
Sacramentum, quod attinet quidem ad relatione^ individualem, perfectius est in
utraque simu^ specie, quam in altera. Greg. de Valent. Ies. de usu Sacra^.
Euch. c. 6.. Secundu^ p. 491. Hoc est convenie^tius u^ui ^uius Sacramenti, ut
seorsim exhibeatur fidelibus corpus Christi in cibum, and sanguis in potum.
Aquinas quo sup. quaest. 76. Art. 2.
mayntaine that This Sacrament, as it is conformable both to Eating and
Drinking, so does it by both kinds, more perfectly express our spiritual
nourishment by Christ: and therefore it is more convenient that both be
exhibited to the faithful severally, as for Meat, and for Drink. So they.
For although, in the Spiritual Receiving, Eating and Drinking are both one,
even as the appetite of the Soul in hungring and thirsting is the same; as
where it is written, Matthew. 5. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness, etc. yet in this Sacramental communicating with bodily
instruments it is otherwise, as you know. Sub specie panis sanguis sumatur cum
corpore, and sub specie vini sumatur corpus cum sanguine, nec sanguis sub
specie panis bibitur, nec corpus sub specie vini editur: quia ^icut nec corpus
bibitur, ita nec sanguis comeditur. Durand. Rational. lib. 4. cap. 41. page 326
The blood of Christ is not drank in the form of Bread, nor is his Body
eaten as meat in the form of Wine, because the Body cannot be said to be
drank, nor the blood to be eaten. So your Durand, and so afterward your See
hereafter Sect. 10.
Iansenius.

Wherefore you, in withholding the Cup from the People, do violate the
Testament of Christ, who requires in this a perfect representation visible of
a complete and a full Refection spiritual, which is sufficient to condemn
your Abuse, whereby you also defraud God's people of their Dimensum, ordained
by Christ for their use. Concerning this second, Answer to his Majesty.
Master Fisher (one of the society of Jesuits) was taught to Answer, that the
Full causality (as he said) and working of spiritual Effects of the soul
cannot be a wanting to the Sacrament under one kind; because of Christ his
assistance. So he. We should ask whether a greater Devotion and (...) more
plentiful Grace are not to be esteemed spiritual Effects, for the good of the
Soul, which are Secundum Alexand^um de Hales -- Mayor fructus ex perceptione
utriusque speci^i habetur. Salmeron. Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 37.. Neque been. page
303. Per accidens autem non est dubium quin usus utriusque specici possit esse
fructuosior, eo quod potest majorem devotionem commoverein percipiente. Vnde
fiat, ut propter majorem dispositionem consequatur ille verlorem gratiam ex
Sacramento. Valent. Ies. ibid. page 493.. Per accidens.
confessed to be enjoyed by Communicating in both kinds; and why not rather
than by one? For consider (we pray you) that the Assistance of Christ does
especially concur with his own Ordinance, and therefore much rather where
the form of a Sacrament ordained, and instituted by himself, is observed,
then where it is (as of you) so notoriously perverted, and contemned. Yet
because you may think we rest upon either our own, or yet of other your
Doctors Judgment in this Defense, we shall produce to this purpose, the
consonant Doctrine of ancient Fathers.

Our third proof is taken from the manifold Reasons of ancient Fathers, for
Confirmation of the Necessity of the Communicating in both kinds.

SECT. IX.
FOr the proof of the necessary use of both kinds, in the solemn and
public dispensation of this Sacrament, the particular Testimonies of many
ancient Fathers might be produced, but your own Authors will ease us of that
labor, by relating and Satis compertum est, universalem Christi Eccl^siam in
hunc usque diem, Occide^talem autem seti Romanam mill amplius a Christo annis,

tum quia in Sacramento sanguinis peculiarem qua^dam virtut^m and gratiam hoc
vinisymbolo significatam esse credebant: tu^m ob rations mysti^as huius

morrem Domini annunciatis donec venerit.] Item ad significand^m integram
refectionem sive nutritionem, quae ^ibo and potu constat, quomodo Christus
inquit, [Caro mea verus est cibus, and sanguis meus verus est po^us.] Item ad
design^ndam redemptionem and tuitionem corporis and animae, ut corpus pro
salute corporis, and sanguis pro salute animae, quae in sanguine est, dari

tantum sumer^tur, -- tum mortem suam ad alterius salutem valere significaretur.

confessing as much in effect, as we did intend to prove, viz. That the ancient
Fathers were induced to the Continuance of the Custom in both kinds, First, by
the Example and Institution of Christ. Secondly, by some particular Grace,
which they held to be signified by the Cup. Thirdly, for the Representation,
that it had to the Passion of Christ; distinctly and respectively to his Body
and Blood. Fourthly, to resemble the Redemption, which man has in his Body by
Christ's Body, and by his Blood in the soul. Fif^ly, To express by these
Symbols the perfect spiritual Nourishments we have by his Body and Blood.
Sixthly, To understand that this Sacrament does equally belong to People, as
well as to Priests. Seventhly, that the Cup of the Eucharist does animate
souls to receive the Cup of bloody Martyrdom, when the time should be.
Whereunto may be added the Constant profession of the ^raeci dicunt esse
necessario sub utraque specie panisscilicet, and vini communicandum, adeo
quidem, ut qui sub una specie tantum communicate etiamsi laicus sit, peccare
dicatur, quod (ut aiu^t) contra Christi praeceptum agat* qu^ sub utraque specie
communicare praecepit. Prat^ol Elench. Haeret lib. 7. tit. Graeci.
Greek Church, in obeying the Canon of Christ, and holding it necessarily to
be observed of the people also, by receiving in both kinds; and that otherwise
we transgress against the Institution of Christ.

All these Testimonies of primitive Fathers, under the Confession, of your own
Doctors, are so many Arguments of the Consonant Doctrine of Antiquity, for
proof of an obligation of precept upon the Churches of Christ whatsoever, for
the preservation of the perfect form of Christ's Ordinance in the administering
of the Sacrament in both kinds. Upon this Evidence may you justly call your
fellow-Priest Master Brereley to account for his bold Assumption, saying that
Liturg. Tract 4 9. p. 425. at Eighthly.
No Doctor (speaking of ancient Fathers) can be produced either expressly, or
else by necessary Consequence, affirming the necessity of the Laics receiving
under both kinds: Your selves perceiving now not only One, but many ancient
Doctors to have expressed not only One, but many Necessities inferring the
same. And then you may furthermore question him for his next as lavish
Assertion, affirming in his fifth Answer, that The Authorities objected, for
the necessity of both kinds, speak not of a Sacramental, but only of a
spiritual Receiving with the mouth of their hearts. When shall we find
conscionable dealing at this man's hands?

Having thus finished our Assumption, we shall more expeditely satisfy such
your Reasons, or rather Pretenses, which you bring to disguize your
sacrilegious Abuse.

The Romish Pretenses for their Innovation and Alteration of Christ his
Institution, by the public use of but One kind.

SECT. X.
WE hear the Council of Trent pretending (as they say) Just reasons of
altering the primitive Custom and use of both kinds, but naming none, which we
may well think was because they deserved not the mention: surely, such they
were, that your Jesuit had rather that you should believe them, then try and
examine them; It being your part (as Porro causas, quae Ecclesiam moverunt, ut
consuetudinem communicandi sub altera probaret, atque etiam pro lege
observanda^ esse decerneret, non tam nostrum est discutere aut inquirere, quam
ipsi Decreto simpliciter obtemperare, existimareque omnino eas fuisse just as,
ut rectissime ex Conc. Trid. definitum est. Greg. Valent. Ies. de legit. usu
Sacra. Euch. c. 10.. Porro, p. 499.
he says) Rather to think them inst, than to discuss them. But we are not
bound to your Rules of blind Obedience. God will have us to use the sight,
which he has given us, least, If the blind leading the blind, both fall into
the Ditch. And whether the Reasons, which are given by your Doctors, be not
blind Seducements, we are now to try. Some of your Reasons are taken from
extraordinary Cases, some Instances are common to all other Churches Christian,
and some are made as being peculiar to the Church of Rome.

The first kind of Romish Pretenses, from extraordinary Cases.

The first Pretense is thus alleged; Ob inopiam vini, cujus in plerisque
Christianitatis partibus magna penuria. Valent. ibid. and Salmeron Jes. Tom. 9.
Tract. 34.. Ad quintum, page 279. And Roffens. in like manner. Bellar. also
adds another Reason to this: Movit Ecclesiam uniformitas, ut concordia populi
Christiani in Sacramento hoc percipiendo, quod est Sacramentum pacis and
unitatis, propter eos, apud quos vinum inveniri non potest: ut sunt aliquae
provinciae boreales, ubi vinum non invenitur, qui existimarent se Christo curae
non fuisse, aut non ita ut alias provincias, quando Sacramentum instituit. Lib.
4. de Euch. cap. 28.
Many Northern Countries are destitute of Wine, and therefore one kind is to
be used for Concord and Vniformity-sake. Will you be answered from your selves?
Aquinas, making the same Objection of want of Wine, and Wheat in foreign
Countries, Licet non in omnibus terris nascitur vinum aut triticum, tamen ad
omnes terras facile deferri potest, quantum sufficit ad usum huius Sacramenti.
Aquin. part. 3. qu. 74. Art. 1. Sufficit quod Balsamum potest ad omnia loca
transferri. Idem ibid. qu. 72. Art. 2.
Resolves, that Notwithstanding Wheat and Wine may be transported easily to
all parts. Accordingly does he resolve of the want of Balsame, used in your
Consecration, and yet it is far more scarce then Wine or Wheat. Yet what
Northern Country almost can you name, that has not abundance of Wine for
many persons, even unto r^ot, and can they not as well have it in moderate
measure, for a sacred Rite?

But what talk you of Uniformity and Concord, in this Case of Alteration,
(which are your two next Pretenses) wherein notwithstanding the Church of Rome
is dissenting from the Greek, and all other Christian Churches in the World?
Or if this were a necessary Cause, why did not your Church allow the use of
both kinds to the Church of Bohemia, but twice raised a fierce war against
them? for which your Jesuit Bis Principes Germaniae ad Bohemos (quod
Communionem sub utr^que specie communicarent) debellandos arma sumpsere,
hortatore Cardinale luliano S. Angeli, Apo. stolicae sedis Legato doctissimo
pariter and rerum gerendarum prudentia ornatissimo viro: quanquam bellum non
satis feliciter successit. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 35. page 284.
Salmeron seems to be full sorry; marry it was, because that war had not
his wished success. Is their Concord in Hostility? Again, because you
thirdly pretend Uniformity also, why then do your consecrating Priests only
receive both kinds sacramentally, and all the other Priests in Communicating
participate but in one? or how is it that you allow a ^priuiledge to See a
little after at (p.)
Popes, Cardinals, Monks, and noble Personages, to receive in both kinds, and
deny this liberty to others? Is there likewise Uniformity in Disparity?

Your fourth Pretense is because diverse are Multi sunt Abstemij, qui vinum non
ferunt. Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. cap. 28.
Abstemious, and have an Antipathy against Wine, and some sickly persons also
can hardly receive without Irreverent casting it up again. If the particular
reason, which Dice^dum, quod vinum modice sumptum non potest multum aegrotanti
nocere. Aquin. par. 3 quest. 74. Art. 1.
Aquinas gives, saying, That Wine moderately taken of such can do no hurt,
may not satisfy, yet this being also a Cause accidental, and extraordinary,
you ought to be regulated by this general Rule, That extraordinary Cases ought
not to iustle out ordinary Laws and Customs. For, that Command of Christ to
his Apostles, Go preach to every Creature of man, stood good in the general,
albeit many men happened to be deaf. Saint Peter requires of every Christian
of fit years that he be prepared to give an answer of his faith to everyone
that asks; which precept was not therefore alterable, because of multitudes
of many that were dumb. Finally, to close up with you, he that by the rule of
Hospitality is to cheer up his Guests, does not prescribe, that, because some
men's stomachs are queasie, and not able to endure Wine, or else some meats;
therefore all others should be kept from fasting from all meats and Drinks:
and the Eucharist (you know) is called by Saint Paul, The supper of the Lord,
and by ancient Fathers, an holy See above Chap. 2. Sect. 9. in the Chall.
Banquet.

The second kind of Romish Pretenses is of such, which might have been common
to other Churches.

The other Causes abovementioned were common to the primitive Church of
Christ, wherein the use of both kinds was (notwithstanding) preserved and
continued; except that you will say, no Northern Nations were Christians in
those times: and that no stomachs of Christians were disaffected to wine, in
loathing it, etc. But two other Pretenses you have, which you think to be of
more special force, to forbid the use of this Sacrament in both kinds; One is
Because (says your Primo movet Ecclesiam consuetudo recepta and approbata
consensu Gentium and Populorum. Bellar. quosup.
Cardinal) Such is the now-received and approved custom of Nations and
People. So he. But first to argue, that your Church did therefore forbid the
use of both kinds, because she had approved the contrary Custom, is a mere
Nugacitie and Tautologie; and as much as to say, She would forbid it, because
she would forbid it. Secondly, saying, that the Use of but One kind had
indefinitely the Consent of Nations and People, is a flat falsity, because (as
has been confessed) The Greek Church (not to mention Aethiopians,
Egyptians, Armenians, and Others) have always held the Contrary Custom.
Lastly, to justify your Churches Innovation, in consenting to the humor of
People of later times, what can you censure it less than a gross and absurd
Indulgence?

The other Motive, which the Movet Ecclesia^, and quidem vehementer
Irreverentia and profanationes tanti Sacramenti, quae vix evitari possent in
ta^ta fidelium multitudine, si omnibus daretur sub utraque specie. Bellar. ibid.
Cardinal calls a Vehement presumption, and which all your Obiectors most
earnestly urge, is the Cause of Irreverence, lest the blood might be split,
especially in such a multitude of faithful Communicants: and also least any
particle of the Host fall to the ground, says Master Liturg. tract. 4.. 6.
Brereley.

We have but four Answers to this mighty Objection. First, that this was not
held a Reason to Christ, or his Apostles, or to the Church of Christ for many
ages, when notwithstanding the multitudes of Communicants were innumerable.
Secondly, that The Casual spilling of the Cup, says your Vtriusque specici
vsum illicitum esse atque sacrilegium ait. -- falsum est, quod usui Calicis
annexum sit peccatum vel sacrilegiu, propter periculum effusionis: nam si hab
eret adiu^ctum peccatum, neque Christus Dominus, neque Apostoli in primitiva
Ecclesia, nee Orientales modo, nec Occidentales ante Conc. Constantiense, neque
denique Sacerdotes celebrantes eo ut erentur ritu Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract.
37.. Deinde, p. 308.
Salmeron, is no sin, else would not Christ have instituted the use of the
Cup: nor would the Apostles, or primitive Church as well in the West as in the
East, in their communicating; nor yet the Priest in consecrating, have used it.
So he. We might add, by the same reason should people be forbid the other
part also, left (as your Priest said) any particle thereof should fall to the
ground. Furthermore, for the avoiding of Spilling, you (as your Cardinal Alan
Cernuntur hodie ex antiquitate relictae quaedam fistu lae argenteae and aureae
velut canales, calicibus vetustioribus adjunctae, ut per eas sine effusione
hauri^i posset ^anguis e calice, quarum in Ordinario Romans fit mentio. Et adhuc
in Missa solenni Pontificis adhibentur, ubi ministri Cardinales, aut
illustriores personae communicant sub utraque specie, posteriorem speciem
fistula haurientes. sed ista instrumenta non fuisse in usu apud plebem in
parochialibus Ecclesijs plane existimo, sed tantum in sacris Cardinalium,
Canonicorum, and Monachorum Conventibus. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch. cap 47. p. 495.
relates) have provided Pipes of silver, which are used by Popes, Cardinals
Monks, and some other Illustrious lay-Personages. Surely, there being no
respect of persons with God (as said S. Peter) we think that he, who will be
S. Peter's Successor should have taken out with S. Peter that lesson of Christ,
of loving the whole flock of Christ, as well Lambs as Sheep; not to provide
Pipes or Tunnels for himself alone and his Grandes, for receiving this part of
the Sacrament, and to neglect all other Christians, albeit never so true
members of Christ. For this we all know, that 1. Cor. 11. Itaque fratres mei,
cum conven^ritis, invicem expectate.] Dominus ex aequo Tibi and pauperimensam
proprij corporis, and poculum sanguinis t^adidit. Test Salmeron. Ies Tom. 14.
Disp. 19. page 153.
Our Lord Christ prepared his table as well for the poor as the Rich, according
to the Apostles Doctrine, by your own construction, answerable to the Doctrine
of ancient Fathers. And that the pretense of Reverence cannot be a sufficient
Reason of altering the ordinance of Christ, we may learn from ancient
Histories, which evidently declare that the opinion of Reverence has often
been the Damme and Nource of manifold Superstitions.

As for example. The Heretics called Discalceati, in pretense (*) See. 9.
of more humility, thought that they ought to go bare-foote. The (*) See
above. Secto 8. (g)
Encratitae, in pretense of more sanctitity, abhorred marriage. The Aquarij
solam aquam apponendam asserebant, sobrietatis conservandae causa vinum
vitantes. Alfons. a Castro cont. Haeres. Tit. Eucharistia, Haer. 6.
Aquarij, in pretense of more sobriety, used water in this Sacrament. The
Manichees wanted not their pretense of not drinking wine in the Eucharist,
because they thought it was created by an evil Spirit. And yet were these
judged by Pope Gelasius to be Sacrilegious. Yea and what greater defense had
the Pharisees, for all their Superstitions, than that of Reverence? whom
notwithstanding Christ did pierce through with so many Vae's, for annulling of
the Precepts of God, by their Traditions, under the pretense of religious
Reverence and sanctity.

In brief. It was the opinion of Reverence that made S. Peter to contradict
our Lords command, when he said, Thou shall never wash my feet: yet how
dangerous it had been for Peter to have persisted in opposition, the Reply of
our Savior does declare. If I wash not thy feet (says Christ) thou have no
part with me, etc. Upon which Text S. Discamus Christum, prout vult, venerari,
honorato namque iucundissi^us est honor, non quem nos putamus; nam and eum
Petrus honorare putabar, cum sibi pedes eum lavare prohibuit: sed non erat
honor, quem agebat, sed contrarium. Chrysostom. Hom. 60. ad pop. Antioch. Tom. 5.
Chrysostom. reads unto you this Lecture. Let us therefore learn (says he) to
honor and reverence Christ, as he would, and not as we think meet. And sure
we are, that he would that same which he commanded, saying, [Doe this.]
Therefore our next Difference, between our defense and yours, is no other than
obedient Reverence, and reverent, or rather irreligious Disobedience.

As for your Pretense of manifesting hereby a Si sic tanta esset dignitas
Laicorum circa su^ptionem corporis Christi, quanta Clericorum? Gerson. Tract.
de utraque specie.
Greater dignity of Priests than of Laics; it is too fantastical for the
singularity; too harsh for the noveltie; and too graceless for the impiety
thereof: seeing that Christ, who gave his Body and Blood an equal price of
Redemption for all sorts, would have the Sacrament of his Body and Blood
equally administered to People, as Priests; as you have heard the Fathers
themselves profess.

The three Romish Pretenses, which are more peculiar to their own Church, in
two points.

First, because Movit Ecclesiam, ad hunc usum stabiliendum and lege firmandum,
quod videret ab Haereticis, and ex errore oppugnari. Sacramentarij autem non
credunt Co^comitantiam sanguinis Domini cum corpore in specie panis: unde etiam
ij Lutheranorum maxim urgent utramque speciem, qui cum Sacramentarijs rident
Concomitantia^. Bellar. l. 4 de Euch. c. 28. Secundo.
Heretics (says Bellarmine, and meaning Protestants) do not believe
Concomitancie, that is to say, that the blood of Christ is received under the
form of bread: but for this Concomitancie the Church was moved to prescribe
the use of the Eucharist in one kind. So he. And this point of Concomitancie
is that which In his Book dedicated to K. James.
M. Fisher, and In his Liturg. of the Mass page 396.
M. Breerly most labored for, or rather labored upon. And albeit your Roman
Maxim omnium ad convellendam eorum haeresin, qui negabant sub utraque specie
corpus Christi contineri. Catech. Romans par 2. c. 4. nu 50.
Catechism judges this the principal Cause of inducing your Church to
prefer one kind: yet we (whom you call Heretics) believe that the devout
Communicant, receiving Christ spiritually by faith, is thereby possessed of
whole Christ crucified, in the inward act of the Soul: and only deny, that
the whole is received Sacramentally, in this outward act, under one only part
of this Sacrament, which is the present question.

And in this we say no more than your Bishop Iansenius judged reasonable, who
has rightly argued, saying, Verum non facile apparet quomodo aperte exterior
illa sumptio dici possit bibitio: manducatio recte dicitur, quia sumitur
aliquid ibi per modum cibi: sed quomodo bibitio, cum nihil sumatur per modum
potus? non n. diceremus eum and manducare and bibere, qui panem tinctum vino
sume^et, quamvis sumat quod famem tollat and sitim. Proinde, secundum horum
sententiam vider^tu^ omnino dicendum -- cum dicitur manducare, and bibere, non
ratione actus exterioris, qui manducationis tantum speciem habet: sed ratione
actus interioris, nempe, ratione fidei. Jansen. Concord. in Evang. page 457.
It does not easily appear how the outward receiving of Christ, under the
form of Bread, should be called Drinking, but only Eating, being received
after the manner of meats, as that is called Drinking only, which is received
after the manner of Drink. Drinking therefore and Eating are distinguished by
Christ, in the outward Act. So he, even as your own See more expressly in the
testimony of Durand above, Sect. 8.
Durand before him had truly concluded, with whom M. See Book 2. Cap. 2.. 4.
Breerly will bear a part.

Therefore your Concomitancie (if we respect the Sacramental manner of
Receiving) is but a Chimaera, and as great a Solecisme as to say, that the Body
and Bones of Christ are drank, and his Blood eaten: contrary to the
Sacramental representation, in Receiving Bread and Wine, as has been prooved.

Next, when we ask you why only your Church will not reform and regulate
her Custom, according to the Institution of Christ, and the long practice of
the primitive Church? you answer plainly, and without Circumlocution, that the
Reason is, Lest that your Church might seem to have erred in her alteration of
the ancient Custom. And this your Secunda ratio, quia qui Concomitantiam
negant, ex alio pernitioso errore petunt utramque speciem: quia nimirum
existimant iure divino esse praeceptum; and propterea totam Ecclesiam longo
tempore in hac re turpiter errasse. Bellar. qu^ sup.. Secundo.
Cardinal Bellarmine and the Jesuit Rectissime facit Ecclesia, quod ipsa
praxi contraria refu^at little haeresin, qui utramque speciem iure divino
necessariam omnibus esse perperam contendunt. Quae ratio iure optimo inter
coetera considerata est in Conc. Constant. contra Bohemos; and in Conc.
Trident. contra recentiores Sectarios. Greg. de Valent. Ies. Tract. de usu
Eucharist. cap. 10.. Deinde, p. 499.
Valentian use and urge as a necessary Reason for confutation of Protestants,
who held the necessity of public Communion in both kinds. Which Reason your
own Orator Gaspar Cardillo proclaimed (as in a manner) the sole cause of
continuing your degenerated use, Ego existimo, Patres, non solum nullam
legitimam causam esse, sed neque fingi posse, cur de consensu vestro Laici
calicem bibant: neque pa^i ullo modo velitis a more vestro quempiam decedere
latum unguem. -- Inprimis, quoniam Ecclesia illud praecepit, ut alteram tantum
speciem Laicis porrigamus, cui m^rito nobis obtemperandum est, quia nihil agit
sine magna ratione, neque in huiusmodi legibus ferendis errare potest. Denique
si latam legem nulla evidenti necessitate convellatis (Patres) suspicari multis
in mentem veniet, aut vos illam temere nulloque consilio tulisse olim
suscipisseque, aut susceptam cum ratione and servatam diutissime in Christiana
Republica nulla vel causa vel ratione pro nihilo ducere, quo nihil fieri potest

Cardillo Villalpand: Orat. apud* Act. Conc. Trid. page 219, 221, 222.
Least that the Church (says he) may seem to have erred. What can more savor
of an Heretical and Antichristian spirit, than this pretense does? For an
Heretic will not seem to have erred, and Antichrist will profess himself
one that cannot err: which Character of not personal erring was never assumed
of any particular Church, excepting only the latter Church of Rome.

Our Assumption. But the Church of Rome (which will seem that she cannot
possibly err in her not administering the Cup unto Laics) is known to have
erred 600. years together in the abuse of the same Sacrament, by administering
it (in an opinion of necessity) unto Infants, as has been plentifully See
above, Chap. 2. Sect. 11.
witnessed by eminent Doctors in your own Church. Hence therefore arises
another difference, between the profession of our Custom and yours, which is,
between Christ and Antichrist. All this while you do not perceive but that
your opinion of Concomitancie will ruinate the foundation of your Doctrine of
Transubstantiation, whereof In the third Book.
hereafter.

The seventh Comparison is between the manner of Institution, and manner of
Alteration thereof.

SECT. XI.
THe beginning of the Institution in both kinds is known and acknowledged to
have been authorized by him, who is the (...) of the new Testament, even
Christ our Lord, by whom it was established and published among all his
Disciples, at his last Supper: But your Custom of only one kind, How (we
beseech you) came it into your Church? tell us. Nulla praeceptorum vi, sed
consensu quodam tacito tam populi quam Cleri sensim irrepsit dicta consue^udo.

notandum, alterius speciei communionem non tam Episcoporum mandato, quam populi
usu and facto conniventibus tamen Praesulibus, irrepsisse: populus enim ob
varia incommoda paulatim a calice abstinebat. Episcopi propter varia effusionis
sanguinis, aliaque pericula tacendo hanc abstinentiam comprobabant: quae
abstinentia a calice cum tempore* Constantiensis Conc. fere per Europam
universalis esset, non erat damnanda, sed contra Haereticos insurgentes
defendenda. Coster. Ies. Enchirid. Tract. de Com. sub. utraque specie, page

It came not in by any precept, but crept in by little and little, by the
Tacit and silent consent of the Bishops. So your Bishop Roffensis, and your
Jesuit Costerus, and Friar Castro. This confessed unknown manner of Alteration
of this your Custom, as it does utterly refute your common Objection, viz.
That every Doctrine and Custom must be judged ancient and Catholic, the
beginning whereof is not known; so does it more specially put your M. Breerly
to his blush, who durst make the same objection in this very Case, in defense
of the use of but One kind, to prove it to have been from the beginning,
because No first known beginning of our Catholic practice ( Liturg Tract 4 9.
at the end thereof.
says he) can be instanced. And yet behold here no certain beginning of this
Romish Custom; yet notwithstanding confessed to be an Alteration different
from the Custom, which formerly for a thousand years was held a Catholic
Custom.

Was not the Church of Rome then a wise and a worthy Mistress of Churches, trow
you, to suffer her Priests to be guided by the People in a matter of this
nature? what other difference can this make between our Custom and yours, but
that which is between divine Ordinance and popular negligence; or as between a
public Professor, and a Thee^ish Creeper? Heresy is certainly a disease, but
wot you what? the 2. Tim 2. 15.
Apostle notes it to be a Cancer, or Gangrene, which is a disease Creeping by
little and little, from joint to joint, until it have eaten up the vital
parts; such a Cancer was this your Custom, if you shall stand to your own
former Confessions.

Our last Comparison is between the Contrary dispositions of Professors, one
in continuing, and distinguishing; a second in mixing; the third in rejecting
both kinds.

SECT. XII.
THe Comparison, between the diverse dispositions of Professors, none will be
more willing to show than your Jesuit Quod vero attinet ad tempora, triplicem
in coetu Christiano statum, Nic. de Cusano Card. expendit; ferventis nimirum,
calidae and frigentis. Initio n. fuit Ecclesia ad fundendum pro Christo
sanguinem fervens, and tunc data est illi utraque species, ut sanguinem Domini
bibens, sanguinem suum pro illo libenter effunderet. -- In sequenti statu
Ecclesia fuit calida, licet non ita fervens, and tunc non dabatur bina species,
sed panis tantum sanguine infusus, ut ex quibusdam veteru^ Patrum sententijs
Concilijsq colligi potest. Tertius status est Ecclesiae frigentis ac tepidae,
and in ea tantum altera species, panis sc. sine infusione sanguinis Laicis
dispensatur. Salm. Ies. To. 9. Tract. 34.. Quod vero, p. 277.
Salmeron, who will have you out of Cardinal Cusanus to observe three States
of the Church. The first is in her Fervencie; The second in her Warmnes; The
third in her Coldness. In the first state of her Fervencie, when the Christians
affected Martyrdom for the Gospel of Christ, then did the People (says he)
communicate in both kinds. In the second state, which was in her Warmnes
(though not so hot boiling as before) They then used to dip the Host into the
Chalice, and so were made jointly partakers of both, in one. But in the third
state of Coldness, the people were allowed the Sacrament only under one kind.
So he.

CHALLENGE.
IF now Truth may be judged by the different dispositions of Professors, then
may this former Confession witness for us that there is as much difference
between the Primitive and the now Romish Custom, as there is between lively
Fervencie, and senseless Numnes and Coldness, that is to say, Godly zeal, and
Godless indevotion and negligence: yet a negligence not only approved (which
is impious) but (that which is the height of impiety) even applauded also by
your Priests, among whom the Vt nobis locupletissimi testes, atque omni
exeptione maiores retulerunt, in Germania qui eo loci per omnia obediunt Romans
Pontificibus, non solum (Reverendi Patres) calicem vitae non cupiunt, aut
petere audent, etc. Gasp. Card. Villalp. opud Act. Conc. Trid. p. 222.. Accedit.
abovesaid Gaspar Cardillo in the Council of Trent, with exultation told
their Father-hoods (as being a matter of great joy) that they who are under the
Jurisdiction of the Church of Rome, in Germany, do not so much as desire the
Cup of life. So he.

A GENERAL CHALLENGE, Concerning this last Transgression of Christ his Mass.

SECT. XIII.
IN this we are to make an open discovery of the odious Uncharitableness, the
intolerable Arrogancy, the vile Perjury, the extreme Madness, and Folly,
together with a note of plain Blasphemy of your Romish Disputers in Defense
of this one Roman Custom of forbidding the Cup to faithful Communicants. For
what Uncharitableness can be more odious, than when they cannot but confess,
that there is more spiritual grace in the receiving of the Communion in both
kinds, do notwithstanding boast, even in the open Council of Trent, of some
of their Professors, who in obedience to the Church of Rome, do not only ( See
the next testimony above.
their own words) not desire the Cup of life, but also dare not so much as
desire it. Which Vaunt, we think, besides the Impiety thereof, infers a
note of profane Tyranny.

Secondly, when we compare these Fathers of Trent with the Fathers of most
primitive Antiquity, they answer, Tertio loco obijciunt Ecclesiae sapientiam,
antiquitatem, atque potestatem; aiunt enim, Ecclesiam primitivam, quae
antiquior and scientia atque vitae sanctitate praestantior erat, utraque specie
usam fu^sse: nostra igitur illam imitari debet, praesertim cu^ eandem atque
illa habet potestatem in eiusmodi legibus positivis sieve abrogandis sieve
dispensandis. Respondemus, non esse dubium quin Ecclesia primitiva nostrae
maiore charitate, ac proinde uberiori sapientia praecelluerit, nihilominus,
tamen interdum co^tingit minus sapientem in aliquo melius sapere, quam al^^m
absolute sapientiorem. Saepe etiam accidit, minus p^^fectum hominem vitare
aliquem errore^, quem melior non vitat. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 38..
Tertio loco, p. 320.
Although the primitive Church (say they) did exceed ours in Zeal, Wisdom,
and Charity, nevertheless it falls out sometimes, that the wiser may in some
things be less wise then another. Which answer, if we consider the many
Reasons, which you have heard the Fathers give, for the use of both kinds, and
their consonant practice thereof, what is it but a vilifying of the authority
of all ancient Fathers? and indeed (as the saying is) To put upon them the
Fool. The like answer two of their Jesuits made to the Practice of the
Apostles, saying that your Church, having the same spirit, has the same power
to alter the Custom, whereas we have proved that the ground which the
Apostles lay for their Custom was the Institution of Christ. But that which
the Roman Church alleges is merely a pretense of Plenitude of her own
Authority; It is impossible therefore that in so great a Contradiction there
should be the same Spirit. And can there be a more intolerable Arrogancy than
is this, which this Roman spirit bewrays in both these?

Thirdly, upon the Consideration of this their Contempt of Apostolical and
primitive Antiquity, in this Cause, we find that your Romish Priests are to
be condemned of manifest perjurie also; For in the Form of Oath, for the
profession of the Romish Faith, every Priest and Ecclesiasticke is sworn Forma
Iuramenti, per Bullam Pij quarti. Apostolicas and Ecclesiasticas Traditiones
admitto, -- Ego spond eo, and juro, etc.
To admit of all Apostolical and Ecclesiastical Traditions; as also to hold
what the Coetera omnia a Concilio Tr^dent. declarata and confirmata firmissime
^eneo. Ibid. Romanam Ecclesiam Magistram esse Ecclefiar u^do, etc.
Council of Trent has decreed: But this Custom of administration of both
kinds, as has been acknowledged, was an Apostolical Custom, and from them
also remained in an Ecclesiastical profession and practice thorow-out a
thousand years space; which your Church of Rome, notwithstanding, in her
Council of Trent, (whereunto likewise you are sworn) has altered and
perverted: which does evidently involve your Priests, and Jesuits in a
notorious, and unavoydable Perjury.

Fourthly, As for the note of Foolishness, what more mad folly can there be
seen in any, than to take upon them a serious Defense of a Custom, for
satisfaction of all others, and yet to be so unsatisfied among themselves? so
that both the Objections urged by Protestants against that Abuse are fortified,
and also all your Reasons for it are refuted either by the direct Testimonies
of your own Doctors, or by the Common Principles and Tenants of your Church,
or else by the absurdities of your Consequences issuing from your Reasons and
Answers; diverse of them being no less gross, then was your objecting the
Antiquity and Generality of the particular Roman Church, for less then three
hundred years, and to prefer it before the confessed Universal primitive
Custom of above the Compass of a Thousand years continuance before the other.

Fifthly, the last is the note of Blasphemy; for this name the contempt of
Christ his last Will and Testament must needs deserve; and what greater
contempt can there be, than contrary to Christ his [Doe this] (concerning both
kinds) to profess that Sacrilegious dismembring of the holy Sacrament, which
Gelasius the Pope himself had anciently condemned? or if this be not
Blasphemous enough, then, supposing that Christ indeed had commanded
Consecration in both kinds, upon divine right, yet notwithstanding to hold it
very probable (as says your Jesuit Licet Gabriel, and quidam alij sentiant
divini juris esse, ut Sacerdos in utraque specie sacrificet, nihilominus' tamen
opinantur authoritate Romans Pontificis fieri posse, ut in una tantum specie
sacrificet, viz. in consecratione panis fine vino, quia putant multa esse juris
divini, quae remittere and relaxare Potifex queat ob publicam aliquam and
gravem necessitatem: ut videmus votum, iusiurandu^, matrimonium ratum, no^
consummatu^, authoritate Pontificis relaxari and dissolvi. Et ita in hac
quaestione prima puto probabilius and verius esse (ut dixi) iuris esse divini,
ut Sacerdos in duplici specie sacrificet. Et nihilominus existimo valde
probabile, authoritate Pontificia, ob publicam and urgentem necessitatem,
praedictum jus divinum relaxari posse. Sed* quia nunquam est relaxatum, ego
confilium darem ut nunquam relaxaretur. Azorius Ies. Tom. 1. Instit, Moral.
lib. 10. cap. 19.. Tertium page 857.
Azorius) that the authority of the Pope may dispense therewith. But because
Divine right was never yet dispensed with, 1 (says he) would give my Counsel
that it never may be. O Jesuit! thus to deal with Christ his Command. If he
or any other Jesuit had made as bold with the Pope, as this does with Christ
himself, saying unto him; Any of your Decrees (holy Father) may be dispensed
with by any Jesuit of our Society: yet because no Jesuit has taken upon him
hitherto so much, my counsel is that none of your Decrees be ever dispensed
withal. The Pope, we suppose, albeit he would thank this man for his
counsel, for not Doing so; yet doubtless, would he reward him with a welcome
into the office of his holy Inquisition, for his judgment, to think it
lawful so to do: namely, to leave it to the discretion of every Jesuit, to
dispense with his Papal Decrees. And notwithstanding the Jesuits [Suppose]
we may depose, that your Romish license, for but one kind, is a dispensing,
or rather a despising of the Ordinance of Christ.

We are already wearied with citing of the manifold, vilde, odious, and
irreligious Positions of your Disputers and Proctors, for this your Cause; yet
one Pretense more may not be pretermitted, least we might seem to contemn the
wit and zeal of your Jesuit Salmeron, against the use of this Sacrament in
both kinds. The use of both kinds (says Dispensandus non est utriusque,
speciei usus Haereticis, quia non sunt da^da sancta Canibus: nec Catholicis,
quia debent distingui ab Haereticis, qui communicant sub duab. Salmeron Jes.
Tom. 9. Tract. 37.. His pofitis, p. 411.
he) is not to be allowed to Catholics; because they must be distinguished
from Heretics: nor to Heretics, because bread is not to be given unto Dogs.
Now blessed be God! that we are esteemed as Heretics and Dogs, to be
distinguished from them, in this and other so many commanded Acts; wherein they
have distinguished themselves from all Primitive Fathers, from the Apostles of
Christ, and from Christ himself.

An Appeal unto the ancient Popes and Church of Rome, against the late Romish
Popes and Church; in Confutation of their former Transgressions of Christ his
Institution.

SECT. XIV.
THe ancient Popes and Church of Rome were (as all the world will say) in
authority of Command, in synceritie of judgment equal, and in integrity of
life Superior unto the latter Popes of Rome and Church thereof; yet the
ancient held it as a matter of Conscience for the Church, in all such Cases
belonging to the Eucharist, to be conformable to the Precept and Example of
Christ, and of the Apostles. So, you have heard, P. Calixtus. See above Chap.
2. Sect. 9.
Pope Calixtus (An. Christi, 218.) requires all persons present at the Mass
to Communicate. For which reason it was (we think) that Pope P. Greg. Ibid. at
(b.)
Gregory (Anno 600.) commanded every one present at the Mass; and not
purposing to Communicate, to Depart. There is an History related by Aeneas
Sylvius (after, Pope Pius the Second) which shows the reason why another See
above, Chap. 2. Sect. 7. Chall. 5. (a.)
Pope of Rome, with his Consistory, yielded a liberty to the Sclavonians, to
have Divine Service in their National Language; and reports that it was
through the sound of that voice (which is written in the Psalms) Let every
tongue praise the Lord. P. Julius. See above Chap. 3. Sect. 3.
Pope Julius (Anno 336.) was much busied in repressing the sopping of bread in
the Chalice, and other like abuses of the Sacrament in his time: and the
reason, which he gave was this; Because (quoth he) these Customs are not
agreeable to Evangelicall and Apostolical Doctrine: and our Church of Rome
does the same. Where he adds, concerning the manner of Communicating, Ibid.
We read (says he) that both the Bread and Cup, were distinctly and
severally delivered. As if he had meant, with the same breath, to have
confuted your other Romish Transgression in distributing to the people the
Sacrament, but in one of Both: And who can say but that Gregory and Leo, both
Popes, See above Chap. 3. Sect 4.
observing the same use of Christ, had the same Resolution? Sure we are that
Pope P. Gelasius. See above Chap. 3. Sect. 4.
Gelasius (Anno 494.) called the Abuse, in dismembring of this Sacrament, by
receiving but in one kind, A Grand Sacrilege.

We read of a Council held at Toledo in Spain, under Pope Sergius, styled
Synod. Tolet. 16 -- Conc. Generale, sub Sergio Papa. Baron, ad An. 693 This
Council, cap. 6. says, Quoniam quid a^ non panes m^ndos atque integros, sed
crustulam and particulam offerunt -- quod nequaquam in sacrae authoritatis
historia gestum perpenditur; ubi legitur Christum benedixisse and dedi^se
panem, etc. Apud Binium Tom. 3. And this being, by Baronius, a General
Council, could not conclude without the Popes consent, in your judgments.
general, (Anno 693.) reproving those Priests who offered Bread in crusts and
lumpes. But with what reason were they reprehended? Because (says the
Council) that fashion i^ not ^ound in the sacred Story of the Evangelists.
All those ancient Popes, who held the Example of Christ, in his Institution and
Apostolical Customs, to be necessary Directions of Christ his Church in such
points, concerning the ministration of this Sacrament, being so utterly
repugnant to your now Romish opinions and Practices; it must follow, that those
former Popes being admitted for Judges, whom all Christians acknowledged to
have been Apostolical in their Resolutions, the now Romish Church and her
degenerate Profession must needs be judged Apostaticall.

Now, from the former Actual, we proceed to the Doctrinall points.

THE SECOND BOOK,
Concerning the first Doctrinall Point, which is the Interpretation of the
words of Christ's Institution; [THIS IS MY BODY: THIS IS MY BLOOD.] LVKE 22.
The Doctrinall and Dogmaticall points are to be distinguished into your Romish
1. Interpretation of the words of Christ his Institution; [This is my Body;
etc.] 2. Consequences deduced from such your Expositions: such as are
Transubstantiation, Corporal Presence, and the rest.

CHAP. I.
Of the Exposition of the words of Christ, [THIS IS MY BODY.] The State of the
Question in General.

BEcause (as In scriptura explicanda haeresis est manifesta, sicut figurata
proprie accipere, ita quae sunt proprie dicta ad Tropica^ locutione^
detorquere: nam in verbis [Eunuchi sunt qui se castrant propter regnum coelorum
etc.] August. and to the same purpose also, lib. 3. de Doctr. Christ.
Saint Augustine says of points of faith) It is as manifest an Heresy, in the
interpertation of Scriptures, to take figurative speechees properly, as to take
proper speeches figuratively (And such is the CAVEAT, which -- Hoc cavendum,
nisi in manifestum Haereseos scopulum impingere velimus. Salmeron. Jes. Tom. 1.
Proleg. 12. page 227.
Salmeron the Jesuit gives you) it will concern both You and Us (as we will
avoid the brand of Heresy) to search exactly into the true sense of these
words of Christ; especially seeing we are herein to deal with the Inscription
of the Seal of our Lord JESUS, even the Sacrament of his Body and Blood. In
the which Disquisition, besides the Authority of Ancient Fathers, we shall
insist much upon the Ingenuity of your own Romish Authors.

And what Necessity there is to enquire into the true sense of these words,
will best appear in the after-Examination of the diverse See before Book, 3,
4, 5, 6.
Consequences of your own Sense, to wit, your Doctrine of Transubstantiation,
Corporal, and Gratian. Sacramenta Christi suscipiendo, carnem eius and
sanguinem materialiter significamus. De Consecrat. did. 2. C. Quia morte.
Material Presence, Propitiatory Sacrifice, and proper Adoration: All which
are Dependants upon your Romish Exposition of the former words of Christ. The
issue then will be this, that if the words be certainly true, in a Proper and
litterall sense, then we are to yield to you the whole Cause: But if it be
necessarily Figurative, then the ground of all these your Doctrines being but
sandy, the whole Structure and Fabric, which you erect thereupon, must needs
ruin and vanish. But yet know withal, that we do not so maintain a
figurative Sense of Christ his Speech, concerning his Body, as to exclude the
Truth of his Body, or yet the truly-Receiving thereof; as the Third and Fourth
Books following will declare.

That a Figurative sense of Christ his Speech [THIS IS MY BODY, etc.] is
evinced out of the words themselves; from the Principles of the Romish Schools.

SECT. I.
THere are two words, which may be unto us as two keys, to unlock the
questioned sense of Christ's words, viz. the Pronoune, [THIS] and the Verb
[IS.] We begin with the former.

The State of the Question, about the word [THIS.]

When we shall fully understand by your Church (which Conc. Trid. Sess. 13.
cap. 1. Verba illa a Christo commemorata, and a Divo Paulo repetita propriam
significationem prae se ferunt.
holds a Proper and litterall Signification) what the Pronoune [THIS] does
demonstrate, then shall We truly infer an infallible proof of our figurative
sense.

All Opinions concerning the Thing, which the word [THIS] in the diverse
opinions of Authors, points at, may be reduced to Three heads; namely, to
signify either This Bread, or This Body of Christ, or else some Third Thing
different from them both. Tell you us, first, what you hold to be the opinion
of Protestants? Lutherans and all Calvinists (says your Lutherani and omnes
Calvinistae pronomen [Hoc] pro pane positum esse dicunt, quia panem Christus in
manu acceperat, and dixit [Hoc est Corpus meum.] Maldon. Ies. in Matthew. 26..
Hoc omnes -- Lutherus in verba Evangelistae. Habent hunc sensum; Hic panis est
corpus meum.
Jesuit) think that the Pronoune [THIS] points out Bread. But your Roman
Doctors are at odds among themselves, and divided into two principal
Opinions. Some of them refer the word [THIS] to Christ's Body, Some to a
Third thing, which you call Individuum vagum. In the first place we are to
confute both these your Expositions; and after to confirm our own.

That the first Exposition of Romish Doctors, of great learning, (referring the
word [THIS] properly to Christ his Body) perverteth the sense of Christ his
Speech, by the Consessions of Romish Doctors.

SECT. II.
Diverse of your Romish Divines of special note, as well Jesuits as others,
interpret the word [This] to note the Body of Christ, as it is present in this
Sacrament, at the pronuntiation of the last syllable of this speech [Hoc est
corpus meum:] Because they are words See below, let. (k. n. o.) etc.
Practical, (say they) that is, working that which they signify (namely) The
Body of Christ. And this sense they call Most clear: and, in their Judgments,
there can be no better then this. So your [Hoc] designat corpus, ut est

CHALLENGE.
ARe not these Opinators in number many; in name for the most part, of great
esteem; their Assertion, in their own opinion, full of assurance; and
delivered to their Hearers, as the only Catholic Resolution? And yet behold
one, whose name alone has obtained an Authority equivalent to almost all
theirs, your Cardinal Argumentum eorum, qui volunt Pronomen [Hoc] demonstrare
Corpus, est absurdum, quod in huius modi propositionibus, quae significant id
quod tunc fit cum dicitur, Pronomina demonstrativa non demonstrate quod est,
sed quod erit. Et ponunt Exempla, ut si quis dum pingit lineam, aut circulum
dicat, Haec est linea, hic est Circulus. Quomodo etiam exponi debet Pronomen in
illis verbis Domini, Ioh. 15. Hoc est praeceptum meum. -- Haec explicatio non
videtur satisfacere, propter duas causas. Primo quia etsi Pronomen

dum pronomen effert, valde absurdum videtur dicere, pronomine illo non
demonstrari rem praesentem. Atqui Dominus accepit panem, and illum porrigens,
ait, [Accipite, Edite, H. E. C. M.] Videtur igitur demonstrasse panem. Neque

etsi ita est de propositione, quae est ratio quaedam, tamen Demonstratiua

Et sane in illis verbis [Bibite ex hoc omnes] valde durum est, non demonstrari

Bellarmine, who, speaking of the same opinion of referring the word [This] to
the Body of Christ, does in flat terms call it ABSVRD: but not without good
and solid reason, and that according to the Principles of Romish Schools; to
wit, because before the last syllable of the last word [Me-um] be pronounced
the Body of Christ is not yet present: and the word [This] cannot demonstrate a
thing Absent, and therefore can it not be said, This body is my body. A Reason
pregnant enough in it self, and ratified by your public Roman Huius vocis

Decret. and inssu Pij Quinti Pontificis Edit. ut in frontispitio libri c^r.
Catechism, authorized by the then Pope, and Council of Trent; yet
notwithstanding your forenamed Irish Jesuit, hearing this Argument objected
by Protestants, rayleth down right, calling it Accursed, as judged by the
Church Heretical, and indeed Abominable. So he, who with Others, if they
were of fit years, might be thought to deserve the rod, for forgetting their
General Catechism, and for defending an Exposition, which even in common
sense may be pronounced, in your Cardinal's own phrase, very Absurd; else
show us, if you can, but the least semblance of Truth for that Opinion.

Similitudes objected, for defense of their former Exposition, and confuted by
their own fellows.

The Similitudes which are urged, to illustrate your former Practical and
operative sense, are of these kinds, to wit; Even as if one (say Bellar. See
above at let. (k.)
They) in drawing a Line, or a Circle, should say in the making thereof, This
is a Line, or, This is a Circle: or as if the Smith (say Haec locutio, [Hoc est
corpus meum] habet virtutem factivam conversionis panis in Corpus Christi, ut
an Thomas. -- Pro simili, quod rudi intellectui satisfacere valeat, dari
potest, ut si Faber accepto ferro clavum subito motu formans, dicat, Hic est

etc.
Others) in making of a Nail, should say, This is a Nail; So by Christ his
saying [This is my Body] it was made presently the Body of Christ, at the very
pronuntiation of the last word of this Sentence, [This is my Body.] But most
conceitedly your Jesuit Malloune, and that not without scurrility, Master
Malloune in his late Reply, p. 105. This is a Kirtle for my wife, etc.
As a Tailor making a Kirtle, and saying (we shall change only his last word)
This is a Kirtle for my Mistress CONVBINA. So they.

CHALLENGE.
THese kind of Subtilties are frequent in the mouths of most Romish Priests,
as often as they are compelled to show what is demonstrated by the Pronoune,
This. But that these your Similitudes of making Circles, Lines, and Nails, are
no better than Iugling, and Gypsie-trickes of fast or loose, and fond devises
forged in the brains of idle Sophisters, and uttered by your Circulary
Priests, your own Authors are ready to manifest for these Examples of the
Painter's touching a Line, or a Circle (as your Bellar. See above at let. (k.)
Bellarmine shows) making and saying, This is a Circle; Is no true
Proposition, until the Circle be made. And then it is a figurative speech and
not a proper, using the present Tence, Is, for the future, Shall be. So he. In
like manner your Jesuit Profecto propositio non est vera, nisi postquam factus
est Circulus: Sed oration accipitur pro vera, quia ^d quod futurum est,
accipitur pro iam facto, per Tropu^, non iuxta Proprietatem sermonis: in que^
sensum Christus plerunque praesens pro futuro vsurpavit: ut Math. 26. Apud te
facio Pascha cum dicipulis men's, id est, confestian facio Pascha Salmero^. Ies.
^om. 9. Tran. 13.. Secunda. -- Si [est] proptie accipiatur, pro existere, durum
est ut vniat subiectum cum praedicato pro futuro tempore, quia falsa esser
propositio, non solum in orationibus speculativis, and significativis, sed
etiam in practicis and factivis: ut si quis volens facere Circulum, rogatus
quid est Hoc, respondeatque, Hic est Circulus; Profecto propositio non est
statim vera, etc. Salm. Ib. p. 83
Salmeron affirms with a PROFECTO and full asseveration, that the speech of
him, who in drawing a Circle does say, This is a Circle, cannot without a Trope
or Figure, be judged true. So he.

And furthermore, who knows not that every Operative speech does signify not
the Being of a thing; but the Making thereof, and bringing of it unto being?
For although the Painter be so nimble, in drawing a Circle, that his hand may
go before his tongue; yet when the Operative virtue consists not in working,
by the agility of the hand, but in the orderly pronouncing of the words of a
speech with the tongue, so that the Truth thereof depends upon the utterance
of the last syllable; It is impossible but the Priest, in uttering distinctly
these words, [Hoc est corpus meum,] must say, This is, before he come to the
last syllable of me-um: and consequently in his sense notify This to be
Christ's Body, before (according to his own judgment) the Body of Christ can
have there any being at all.

By this is discovered the notable vertigo and dizzinesse of your Jesuit
Maldonate; He, to prove that the Pronoune, This, does relate to Christ's Body,
stands upon the like Operative speculation; God (says Quum Deus ex limo
terrae hominem sinxit recte ver eque dicere potuisset, sumpto in manus limo,
Hic est Homo. Et cum ex costa muliere^ fabricauit, sumpta costa dicere potuit;
Haec est mulier, quamuis cum pronunciasset Pronomen [Haec] nondum fuisset
mulier, ac significasset cum ita locutus fuisset, limu^non esse hominem, and
costam mulierem; sed limum in hominem, costam in mulierem converti. Sic cum
Christus dicit, [Hoc est corpus meum,] significat panem mutari in corpus suum.
Quemadmodum si in Cana Galileae, cum aquam in vinum, etc. Maldon. Ies in Matthew.
26. Ita cum Christus dicit, accepto pane [Hoc est corpus meum] quamvis illud
corpus nondum ille esset, sed futurum erat, illud eo pronomine demonstrat, nec
significat panem, quem acceperat, esse corpus suum, sed mutari in corpus suum.
Idemin Matthew. 26. page 635.
he) in creating man of the slime of the earth, might have truly said thereof,
This is man: Or in framing Woman of the Rib of man, might have rightly said;
This is Woman: or Christ in working his miracle in Cana of Galilee, might have
said, (showing the water) This is wine. So he. When, notwithstanding, he is
enforced in every one to alter the Verb, Is, thus; Slime is changed into Man:
Rib is converted into Woman: Water is made Wine, as he himself confesses;
expounding the words [This is my Body] thus, Not that it was then his Body
(says he) which as yet it was not, but was about to be: nor that he signified
the Bread to be his Body, but to be changed into his Body. So he. As if any
thing could be said properly, to be that, which as yet it Is not. Hitherto of
your first Interpretation.

That the second Romish Exposition, referring the Pronoune [THIS] to
demonstrate a Third thing, called Individuum vagum, or Indeterminate substance,
perverteth the sense of Christ his speech [THIS IS MY BODY:] proved by the
Confession of Romish Doctors.

SECT. III.
A Third thing, differing both from Bread and the Body of Christ, which Romish
Sophisters have lately invented, is that which they call Individuum vagum; by
which is meant, a substance confusedly taken; as when one (to use your own e
example) having an Herb in his hand shall say, This herb grows in my
garden: in which speech the word; Herb, which is demonstrated by the pronoune,
This, is not taken determinately, for that singular Herb in his hand, (for that
does not now grow in his garden) but is taken vage and confusedly, for the
common Species, nature, or kind of that herb. And this opinion is defended by
Sententia haec est, P^onomine illo designari aliquid common Substantiae panis
and corporis Christi; Commune (inquam) non secundum Rem, (illud enim nullum
esse potest) sed secundum ratione^ seu denominationem viz. sub ratione contenti
sub his accide^tibus continetur corpus meum. Ita Guitmundus (where he reckons
up 15. other School men:) vbi Pronomen [Hoc] substantive sumitur, and
demonstrat in confuso Ens, sive substantiam contentam sub illis speciebus -- vt
cum quis dicat, Haec herba nascitur in horto meo: illud Pronomen [Haec] non
significat hanc numero herbam, sed herbam huic similem. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. in
Thom. disp 58.. 7. p 7^5* Secundum rationem Substantiae tum communem tum

Respondemus. p. 377. Quia Sacramenta significant quod efficient, and non
efficitur in hoc Sacramento ut corpus Christi sit corpus Christi, quia ita

efficitur ut sub speciebus illis sit corpus Christi, sub quibus antea etat
panis: [Hoc] non demonstrat panem, vel corpus, sed contentum sub speciebus.

number) as the only sufficient and conclusive Resolution of this point,
touching the proper Exposition of the words of Christ, concerning the Pronoune,
THIS.

CHALLENGE.
Which Subtilty is notwithstanding discussed, disclosed, and exploded by your
learned Archiepisc. Caesar. sive Christopherus de Capite fontium. var. Trac.
Demonstrando corpus in genere, nescio quid -- dictum velis, cu^ non Individua
in Generibus suis, sed Genera in individuis demonstrentur, and Pronominis
natura est sola singularia demonstrare -- Ideo si generi addas Pronomen [Hoc]
demonstras non in genere sed in Individuo rem ipsam, -- Conceptus communis non
latet sub speciebus, nec in manibus portari potest. -- Propositio vera dicitur
ex eo, quod res est vera, velnon est vera: ergo non verborum dispositio
consideranda venit -- Rapiunt isti a rerum consideratione lectorem, ut non res
ipsas, sed intelligibiles formas loquendi contempletur. -- Quibus dixerim,
revertiminiad iudicium, o viri, and duas has tantum res Corpus sc. and panem
considerate, quarum alterum tantum demonstrari necesse est. Quia Pronomen vice
nominis Proprij positum prosolo singulari sumi potest, cum Scriptura duarum
tantum substantiarum, quae demonstrari hic queant, meminerit, viz. Panis, and
Corporis, nescio cur fingunt Tertiam aliquam, quae nec panis sit, nec corpus.
In quo magnam vim Scripturae faciunt, infarcientesilli ex suo cerebro tertiam
illam rem, cujus nullam habent mentionem, and qua posita, propositio esset
fal^a, Archiep. Caesar. quo supra p. 12. Si enim Christus ita loqueretur de

possunt de Pan^ consecrando, quod sit corpus Christi. Ibid. p. 17. Solam illam
substantiam singularem demonstrabat, quae erat in Christi manibus, quae erat
aut panis, aut corpus ejus: Tertiam igitur quaerere vanissimus labor est, and
absurditate plenus. Thus far that Archbishop.
Archbishop of Cesarea, and your Jesuit Vulgata opinio est, illud pronomen
[Hoc] neque demonstrare corpus Christi; neque panem, sed accipi vage, pro eo
quod continetur sub accidentibus, quod prius est panis, deinde corpus Christi.
Quae sententia non videtur mihi probabilis esse, quia etsi vocabula solent
aliquando habere vagam and indefinitam significationem, tamen aliud est loqui
de significatione verbi, aliud de acceptione, quam Dialectici vocant
suppositionem. Illa quae dicuntur Individua vaga significationem habent vagam,
and indeterminatam, sed suppositionem habent semper certam, and determinatam:
nam etsi hoc Pronomen [Hic, haec, hoc,] quantum in se est, non magis significat
hunc hominem, quam illum, tamen cum ponitur in propositione (ut hic homo
disputat) non potest accipi nisi determinate pro hoc homine. Ergo necesse est
ut illud Pronomen [Hoc] accipiatur determinate, autpro pane, aut pro corpore
Christi -- Nulla res potest esse nisi determinate aut haec aut illa; Ergo non
possunt haec Pronomina, si substantive accipiantur, nisi pro hac vel illa re
determinata accipi. Maldon. Ies. de Sacram. Euch. Tom. 1.. Tertius error, page
216. 217.
Maldonate, as an Opinion both false and full of Absurdities. 1. Because
whenever the Pronowne [This] is used in Speech, as, This man disputes, it is
always in proper sense, as determinately taken. 2. Christ spoke of that which
was in his hand, but that was no vagrant, but a singular determinate Substance.
And it is gross, to say a man holds a confused substance in his hand. Which
seemed to your Mr. Harding in his answer to the 24. Article, saying; Learn you
what they mean, and if their meaning be naught, handle you them as you list;
you shall not offend us any whit.
Mr. Harding so uncouth and fond an opinion, that he utterly refuses to
defend the Authors thereof.

This, and much more have they written to the discovering and discarding of
this idle figment, wishing furthermore that the Defendants of this opinion, of
Individuum vagum, may return to their wits again, and cease to offer such
violence to this holy Scripture [This is my Body.] So They. And worthily, for
these two words, Individuum, and Vagum, spoken of Hoc, be terms as
Contradictory, as to call the same thing, singularcommon, or
determinate-confused. As for example, Quidam homo, A certain man is in Logique
Individuum vagum; as when Christ said, A certain man went from Jerusalem to
Hiericho, etc. None of the Disciples hearing this could thereupon point him
out, saying; This man: or know thereby who, or what he was.

We, for further manifestation of your Absurdity in this point, will instance
in your own Example, for your Individuum vagum. The Herb, which a man
holds in his hand, saying, This herb grows in my Garden, how can you say
it is true in the proper sense? for if you take it determinately, the same
Herb numero is not in the man's garden, because it is in his hand, and so it
is yet Hoc Individuum determinatum. And if you speak of it in a confused
Notion, no Abstract Notion can be held in a man's hand, it being the function
of the brain, and not of the hand, to apprehend mental Notions, or Generals;
and so it is not Individuum at all.

But the Text says of Christ his hand, [He took bread, etc.] THIS, which
Christ, in so saying, pointed out with his finger, says your [Hoc est corpus
meum.] Hoc quod Christus digito demonstrabat, cumilla verba protulit. Sand. de
visib. Monarch. l. 7. ad Annum. 1547.
Sanders; but a man will have much ado to point out an Individuum vagum (such
as is an invisible, or a confused Notion) with a visible finger. We would now
conclude in the words of a Parisian Doctor, Pe^rus Picherellus de Missa. cap. 3.
Individui vagi commentum Authori Sco^o (...) relinquo; but that something else
is to be added.

Another may be your Cardinal his own Assertion, which he once made as a
snare to catch himself in; for in your Cum ante Consecrationem dicimus in
Litutgia [suscipe sancte Pater hanc immaculatam hostiam] certe Pronomen [Hanc]
demonstrat ad sensus id quod tunc manibus tenemus, id autem est panis. Bell. l.
1 de Missa, c. 27.. Prima propositio.
Romish Mass, the Priest having the Host in his hand, prays thus; Receive,
holy father, This immaculate Host. If you shall ask him what, in this prayer,
the Pronowne This does demonstrate, he tells you readily and asseverantly
saying; Certainly it demonstrateth unto sense that which the Priest has in his
hand, which is Bread. So he. Now why there should not be the like certainty of
Relation of the Pronounc [This] to Bread in the speech of Christ, as it has in
the prayer of the Priest, none of you (we think) shall ever be able to show.

Lastly, we challenge you to show within the space of a Thousand three hundredth
years after Christ, out of all the Ancient Fathers, any one Testimony that
ever affirmed the Pronoune [Hoc, This] to betoken any Individuum vagum, or
Common Substance; or else to confess that this your doctrine is new,
extravagant, and Adulterate. Nor yet can the Defenders thereof say that this is
all one, as to say, This, that is, that which is contained under the form of
Bread, because this is like as when one showing his purse, shall say, This is
money, meaning that which is in his purse; which is a known figure Metonymia.
Yet were it granted that [Hoc] betokened an Indiuiduum vagum, as (to use your
own Similitude) when one says of an herb in his hand, This herb grows in
my garden; so Christ should have said of bread in his hand; This, (that is the
like kind of bread) is my Body: yet would not this make the Speech of Christ
proper, or not figurative, because Christ's Body could no more be properly
predicated of the kind of wheat- Bread; then it could be of that bread of
wheat then in his hand, as Christ himself has taught us, and as we are to
prove unto you. For speaking of his Body, he calls it (...), the grane of
wheat, Ioh. 12. 24. not This grane; yet Christ's flesh is equally called
improperly The grane, as This grane of wheat: whereof the ancient Father
Theodoret will read you all a Lesson in the sixth Section following. And now
this so open and extreme civil war among your selves, in confuting your own
Expositions, will further and confirm peace among us in that one Exposition,
which we are in the next place to defend, as follows.

The Third Proposition, which is (according to the judgment of Protestants)
that there is a Tropicall and improper sense, in the Pronoune [THIS.]

We reason first Hypothetically; If the Pronoune This demonstrate Bread, then
the words of Christ are necessarily to be taken improperly and figuratively.
But the Pronoune This does demonstrate Bread. Our Conclusion will be; Therefore
the words of Christ, necessarily, are to be taken figuratively. All this will
be proved, confirmed, and avouched by Reasons Authorities, and Confessions,
which will admit no Contradiction. We begin at our proof of the Consequence
of the Proposition.

That it is impossible for Bread to be called the Body of Christ; or Wine his
Blood, without a Figure.

SECT. IV.
THe common Dictate of natural Reason, imprinted by God in man's heart, is a
Maxim, and has in it an universal Verity, which neither man nor Devil can
gainsay, and is Confessed by yourselves, viz. Disparatum de disparato non
proprie praedicatur; That is, nothing can be properly and literally affirmed
jointly of another thing, which is of a different nature, viz. It is impossible
to say properly that an Egg is a Stone, or (to take your own Dispatatum de
disparato non praedicatur, valet ^gitur argumentum: Si hoc est lac, non est
ferrum: ita etiam valebit, si hoc est est corpusnon est panis; cum repugnet,
unam naturam de altera diversa dici, ut hominem esse equum citra tropum, vel
Metaphoram. Salm. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 16.. Primum igitur. p. 109.
example) we cannot call A man an horse, without a Trope or Figure, because
their natures are repugnant. So Salmeron. And this he holds necessary. Or
thus: Ne ipse quidem Deus, qui est summa veritas, un quam efficiet, vt hae
propositiones, vxor Lot est Sal, aqua est vinum, asinus est homo, in sensu
composito sint verae. Archiep. Caesar. d^^ens. (...). de Real. Praes. cap. 58.
God, who is perfect Truth, will never make those Propositions to be true at
the same time, viz. that the Wife of Lot is Salt, or Water is Wine, or an Ass
a man. So your Archbishop. Yea, to come nearer to the point: Obseruandum, cum
dicitur vinum es^ sanguis, docetur esse sanguinem per similitudinem, reipsa
autem and proprie est vinum. Et cum dicitur sanguis est vinu^, intelligitur
vinum esse per similitudinem: nec enim reipsa aut proprie esse potest aut vinu^
sanguis, aut sanguis vinum, cum res sunt ipsae diversae inter se, and termini
ut vocant disparati. Bell. l. 2. de Euch. c. 9.. Observand.
We cannot say that this wine is blood, or that this blood is wine, but by a
Similitude or Representation, because they differ in nature. So Bellarmine;
Adding furthermore that it is Non potest fieri ut vera sit Propositio, in qua
subiectum supponitur propane, praedicatum pro corpore Christi: Panis enim and
corpus res diversissimae sunt. Bellar* l. (...). de. Euch. c. 19. Primum.
Impossible the Proposition should be true, wherein the Subject is Bread and
the Predicate is taken for the Body of Christ. And, Bread and Christ's body
(says your Eodem tempore panis triticeus, and corpus Christi esse non possunt,
quia disparata sunt. Sand. de visi^. Monarch. ad Annum. 1549. [To obi^ct De
Christo (...), Deus est homo, were vain, because that is spoken by reason of
^he Hypostaticall Union whereby Accidit Deo ut sit homo, per hypostaticam
vnionem, non per mutationem, which Unity makes God and man in Christ
reciprocal. And we also mean, Disparata absoluta, not Relata, for thus the
same man is father and son.]
Sanders) cannot be properly affirmed one of another.

And indeed it is as Impossible Bread should be properly a body of flesh, as a
body of flesh to be bread; which is grounded upon our first Maxim, which your
Jesuit Salmeron expresses thus. Quoties verbum [Est] res diversarum
naturarum, quae a Latinis dicuntur disparata, unit, and copulat, ibi necessario
ad figuram and Tropum recurramus. Salm. Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 10. p. 138.
As often as the Verb [EST, IS,] joins things of diverse natures together, we
are necessarily to have recourse to a Trope and Figure. Will you be content
that your Gloss, as the tongue of your Church, may have the last word? Then
hearken to it: Sipanis est corpus Christi, ergo aliquid quod non es^ natum ex
virgin est corpus Christ^: and ita animatum est inanimatum. Gloss. Decret. de
Consecrat. did. (...). can. Quia.
If bread be Christ's body, then something is Christ's body, which is not borne
of the Virgin Mary; and then also the same body must be said to be living, and
not living both at once. So your Gloss, confessing hereby an Impossibility of
this Predication, Bread is Christ's Body, in a proper and literal sense. Our
Proposition then stands firm and infallible; our Assumption will be found as
true.

That the Pronoune [THIS] does as verily notify Bread in the words of Christ,
as if he had expressly said, This Bread is my Body; proved first by Scripture.

SECT. V.
THe Text of the Evangelist, Luc. 22. is light sufficient in it self; [Iesus
took bread, blessed it, brake it, and gave it to them, saying, Take, Eat,
THIS, (namely, which they Took; and they took THIS, which he Gave; and he
gave THIS, which he Brake; and he Brake THIS, which he Blessed; and blessed
THIS, which he himself Took; and THIS, which he took, was Bread, [Iesus
took Bread. We appeal to your own Consciences, who never hitherto could
say, that in all these sayings of Christ there was made any Change or
alteration of THIS which he took, till the last word pronounced by the Priest,
which is Meum; nor yet can you deny, but that he took that, which was
properly, and substantially Bread. At the writing of this Sorites, we light
upon an Answer from one Mr. M. Malloune in his late Reply. p. 200. His
Sorites; That which the Governor of the feast in Cana of Galile tasted, was
the same which the Ministers brought him: that which they brought him was the
same that others drew out: that which others drew out, was the same which
others before them powered into the Pots; but that which others powered into the
Pots was water: Therefore that which the Governor of the feast tasted was
water. So he. [None is so witless but will easily, from the light of the Text,
tell him, that the water was changed into wine, before the Governor of the
feast tasted thereof: whereas, in the tenure ^f Christ his speech, you your
selves could never point out any former change at all, before the last
syllable, Meum]
Maloune, encountering it with another, but a false Sorites invented by
himself, to the discountenancing of this true one; only we entreat you, that
at the reading thereof, you will not laugh at his foolery. See the Margin.

Your Grammatical Objection is Childish.

Cardinal Si [Hoc] accipitur substantive, tum sensus erit, [Hoc] i. e. Haec
res, quod si de Pane dieatur, absurdissima propositio erit, non enim potest
dici Hoc de Re quae cernitur, and aperte cognoscitur, nisi sit generis neutrius
illa -- Nemo enim demonstrans de Patre suo, diceret, Hoc est Pater meus.
Bellar. lib 1. de Euch. c. 10.. Porro.
Bellarmine your chief Master, and also your Schoolefellow Although the word
Bread had not been expressed, yet being present in Christ's hand, and pointed
unto, Hoc could not be taken substantively no more then one should say of his
Father, Hoc est Pater meus. M. Breerlye's Liturgy. p. 137.
M. Breerly, as if they would put Protestants to School, tell them that [Hoc]
taken for a Substantive neuter cannot agree with Panis, it being a Thing then
seen and known, and not being of the neuter gender: no more than for a man to
say, De Patre, Hoc est Pater meus. A strange thing, that great Clerks, when
they take upon them to teach others their Grammar, should be so far over-taken
as to need to be put in mind of their Accidence, (if ever they learned it)
which tells them that The neuter gender will agree with any thing that has
no life, whether seen or not seen. In which respect there might be a
difference between, Hoc de Patre, and Hoc de Pane: for although Priscian would
cry out, if he heard one saying, Hoc lana, or Hoc lapis, wherein [Hoc] is
taken adiectively: yet if a Question being raised concerning the lightness and
heavines of Wool, and of Stone, one showing the Wool in his hand should say,
Hoc est leve; the other pointing at the Stone should say, Hoc est grave, will
any think that Priscian would be offended, for [Hoc] in Latin, more then
others would be for (...) in (...). Exodus 8. 19. (...). 1. Pet. 2. 19. (...).
Genesis 213.
Greek, taken for (...), for (...), for (...)? Not to trouble you with that in
your Summa Angelica. tit. Eucharist. quest. 23. Propofitio esset magis propria,
si demonstr^ndo Cibum diceretur [Hoc est Corpus meum.]
Summa Angelica, wherein [Hoc] neutrally taken, is made to agree with Cibus.

And although Protestants be so inexpert in the rudiments of learning, yet will
you not think that they whom you call Catholics could be so deceived; who
(as your Jesuit witnesses) Dicent Calvinistae, Pronomen illud Graecum (...),
and Latinum Hoc Substantiva esse: quod and multi Catholici dixerunt, ideo opus
non esse ut genere conveniat, sed posse esse, Hoc quod vobis do, est corpus
meum. Test Maldon. Com. in Math. 26. page 633.
were Many, that taught that [Hoc] in the words of Christ, put substantively,
may without any Inconvenience agree with Panis, in [This] meaning [This] which
I give you. Are you not yet ashamed of your Rashness? then must we now put you
unto it.

In your own vulgar Latin Translation, it is said of Evah the the wife of
Adam, Salmer. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 16.. Nec rursus. -- Adam de Eva ex costa eius
desumpta, Hoc nun^ os ex ossibus meis. Genesis 2. 13.
Hoc est os, Genesis 2. what Insobriety then is this in your Disputers, so eagerly
to reach that blow unto the Protestants, wherewith they must as necessarily
buffe^ their own Mother Church, by which the same Translation is made
Authentic; and wound their own Consciences, being themselves bound by Oath
to defend it in all their disputations? Away then with these Puerilities,
especially now being busied in a matter of so great importance, wherein
consists the foundation of all the maine Controversies concerning the Roman
Mass. For, if the Pronoune [This] have Relation to Bread, there needs no
further dispute about the figurative sense of Christ's speech.

We return to the School of Christ, the holy Scripture, to consult (about
Christ's meaning) with his Disciple Saint Paul, where he professes to deliver
nothing, concerning Christ his Institution of this Sacrament, but that which
he had 1. Cor. 11. 23.
Received of the Lord. Him we desire to expound unto us the words of Christ,
delivered by Three Evangelists, and to tell what he gave unto them, and what
he called his Body: and he tells us plainly, saying; 1. Cor. 10. 16.
The bread, which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?
alluding to those words of the Evangelists, He brake it, and that was Bread.
And that you may know that this was Catholic Doctrine in the days of
Antiquity, we adioyne the next Proposition.

That it was Bread and Wine, which Christ called his Body and Blood; in the
Judgment of Ancient Fathers.

sayings we may best know by their own Idiome, and Tenure of speech. The first

Christ to have called bread his Body. The third, that Christ's speech was

same Father, as if he had studied to take away all Scales of doubtfulnesse from

Wheat; [Except the Grain of Wheat die, it brings forth no fruit.] The
ninth, that Christ gave to the bread the name of his Body. The tenth, that
Christ said of the Consecrated bread [This is my Body.] The eleventh, that It
was Wine which he called his blood. The twelfth, that He blessed Wine, when he
said drink. And the last; The bread strengthening man's body was therefore
called the body of Christ. All these so Learned and Ancient Fathers (sufficient
Grammarians we trow) teaching the Pronoune [This] to demonstrate Bread, do as
absolutely confute your Romish Exposition, to prove the speech Figurative, as
any Protestant in the world could do, if he were permitted to plead his own
Cause.

CHALLENGE.
WE will try what a Syllogism will do, that, after your Posall in Grammar,
we may encounter you with Logique.

The Mayor. No Bread can possibly be called a Body of flesh, without a figure.
(This Proposition has had the Universal consent of all Schools, by virtue of
that Maxim of Maxims, See above. 4.
Disparatum de Disparato, etc.)

The Minor. But in these words, [This is my Body,] the Pronoune [This] does
demonstrate Bread. (This has been the general Exposition of Fathers.)

The Conclusion. Therefore the words of Christ, [This is my Body] are to be
taken figuratively. (Except you will contradict, both the General confession
of your own Schools, and Universal consent of Ancient Fathers.)

That it was Bread, which Christ called his Body, is proved manifestly from
your own Romish Positions and Principles.

SECT. VII.
YOur first Position is this; The word [This] must either point out Bread, or
the Body of Christ, or that Third common Substance, which you call Individuum
vagum. But to refer the word [This] unto the Body of Christ, is (as has
been See above. 2.
confessed) Absurd. And that the word [This] should signify your Individuum
vagum, is an Exposition fall of Absurdities, as has been also See above. 3.
acknowledged. It remains therefore that the Pronoune [This] points out
precisely, Bread.

A second Principle you have, to wit; That these words [This is my Body] are
words of Consecration, and Operative, so that by [This] is meant that which is
Consecrated, and (as your Council Council. Trident. Sess. 13. c. 4. Fit
Conversio totius substantiae Panis in Corpus Christi.
of Trent speaks) changed into the Body of Christ. But, by the Decree of the
same Council, not the Body of Christ, nor any Third thing, but Bread only was
then consecrated and changed into the Body of Christ. Ergo the Pronoune [THIS]
has only Relation to the Bread.

CHALLENGE.
A New Syllogism would be had, to put the matter out of question.

Mayor. No Sense, which is Impossible, can be given properly to the words of
Christ. [This is my Body.] (This needs no proof.)

Minor. But to call Bread Christ's Body, properly, is a Sense Impossible. (This
has been your own constant See above. 4.
profession.)

Conclusion. Therefore cannot this Sense be given properly to the Body of
Christ. How can you avoid the necessity of this Consequence? All arising from
the nature of Predication, in this Proposition, wherein the Subject is Bread,
the Copula, Is; and Predicate, Body of Christ. Which because it cannot be
properly predicated either of Bread determinate, as to say, This bread in my
hand is Christ's Body; or of Bread undeterminate (which you call vagum) as to
say, This kind of bread is the Body of Christ, it demonstrately shows that
your Doctors can have no greater Adversaries, in this case, than their own
Consciences, which will appear as fully in that which follows.

CHAP. II.
The Second key in Christ's Words [Hoc est Corpus meum: This is my Body,]
opening the Figurative Sense thereof, is the Verb [EST, IS.]

FOr that [Est] in these words has the same sense, as, Signifies; as if
Christ had said expressly of the Bread, This signifies my Body: and accordingly
of the Wine, This signifies my Blood, may be proved by three Propositions
infringible.

Our first Proposition.

The Verb [EST] being joined with a thing that is a Sign, is always
figurative, and the very same with this word, SIGNIFIES.

SECT. I.
FOr although the Verb (Est) be indeed so absolutely simple, in it is own
nature, that it cannot be resolved into any other word (as all other Verbes may
be in like Case) yet does it (albeit accidentally) necessarily infer a
figurative Sense, and is as much as Signifies, or Represents, whenever it
joins the Sign and the Thing signified together. As for Example, A man
pointing at a sign hanging before an Inn, and saying, This is S. George on
horseback, the Verb Is can infer no other Sense than Signifies. Why? even
because the thing, whereof it speaks, is a Sign signifying Saint George. And
Bread in this Sacrament is in all Catholic Divinity a Sign of Christ's Body.
Therefore the Verb [Is] can have no other sense than [Signifieth.]

The former Proposition confirmed by all like Speeches, whether Artificial,
Politic, or Mystical.

SECT. II.
YOur own Jesuits, and common Experience it self will verify this Truth.
First, in things Artificial, as Meronymia, tropus est in Scripturis
frequentissimus, qua continens pro contento, and contra signatum pro signo
usurpari solet; ut ostensa imagine Herculis, dicimus, Hic est Hercules.
Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. proleg. 12. Can. 15.
To say of the Picture of Hercules, This is Hercules, is a figure. Secondly, In
things Politic, as when a Testamentum saepe sumitur pro Legato, seu Re
testata. Barrad. Ies. Just. l. 3. de Euch. cap. 5.
Legacy, given by Will and Testament, is called the man's Will. So they. And
indeed what is more Common, than for a man to say of his Testament, This is my
Will? Of his name subscribed, This is my hand? And of the wax sealed, This is
my Seal? When as his Will (properly taken) is in his heart, his hand is
affixed to his Arm, And his seal may be in his pocket. Thirdly, In Mystical
and Divine Rites; as in Sacrifice, even among the Heathen, according to that
Example out of Homer, which is notable. The Greeks and Trojans, when they
entered into a league, which was to be ratified by a Sacrifice of Lambs, upon
which both sides were to take their Oaths, this their Act is thus expressed
Salm. Jes. Tom. 9. Tract. 15. Male etia^. [Idem prius habuit noster Beza in
Luc. 22. 20.]
-- (...); that is, They brought with them two Lambs, their faithful Oaths.
Where Lambs, the rituall signs of their faithful Swearing, are called
Oaths. An Example (I say) even among the Heathen, which is as appo e to our
purpose, and opposite against your defense, as can be.

Our Second Proposition, answerable to the first.

All the like Sacramental Speeches, in Scripture, are figuratively understood.

SECT. III.
IN all such like Sacramental Speeches, both in the old and new Testament,
wherein the Sign is coupled with the Thing signified, the Speech is ever
unproper and Figurative, and the Verb [Est] has no other force than
Signifies. This Truth is confirmed abundantly by the Testimonies of your own
Jesuits, and others, who come fraught with Examples. First, concerning the old
Testament, Noting that the Sacrifice of the Pascha significat transitum, quia
Angelus transivit domos Israelitarum: haec ratio nominis redditur, cu^ dicitur,
[Transibit enim Dominus cum viderit sanguine^ in utroque post.] Iansen. Epis.
Concord. in Matthew. 26. [It was therefore more then boldness in Bellarmine, l. 1.
de ^uch. cap. 11.. Quaedam to say; Agnus erat proprie Transitus, Agnus being in
the Predicament of Substance: and Transitus in the Predicament of Action.
Paschall Lamb, being but a sign, was called the Passover, or passing over.
Secondly, that Petra hoc in loco dicitur spiritualis, ex qua Deus eduxit per
miraculum a quam, qui a signum fuit e latere Christi profluentis sanguinis and
aquae. Salmeron Ies. in 1. Cor. 10. [Petra autem erat Christus.] Id est, Petra
significabat Christum: ubi signum appellat nomine rei significatae. Perer. Ies.
Com. in Dan. 2. p. 85. [Petraerat Christus.] Erat autem Christus Petra,
certissima scilicet significatione. Arias Mont. in 1. Cor. 10 and Pinta Ies. in
^s. 51.
The Rock, being but a sign of Christ, was called Christ. Thirdly, that
Circumcisio foedus dicitur, and signum foederis, Bellar. lib. (...). de Euch,
c. 11.. Secundo.
Circumcision, being but a sign of the Covenant, was called the Covenant. So
likewise in the new Testament, both concerning Christus cum Nicodemo
spiritualiter intelligendus. Maldon. Ies. in eum locum Ioh 3.
Baptism, which in Christ his Speech to Nicodemus (being but a sign of
Regeneration) is called Regeneration: And Sepul^i lumus, Romans 6. 4. id est,
Christum sepultum repraesentamus. Tolet. Jes. in eum locum.
Baptizing, which (being a Sign of the Burial of Christ) in the speech of
Saint Paul, is called Burial.

Finally, that the most proper Interpretation of the Verb [Est, Is,] in such
like speeches, imports no more, than [Significat,] your Jesuit Quod vero in
illis Orationibus [Petra erat Christus; semenerat verbu^ Dei, Ego sum Ostium]
verbum substantivum sit interpretandum pro significat, aut figurat; non ei id
accidit ex natura sua, aut per se, sed quoniam Petra illa aliter cum Christo
coniungi non potest, quam per signum -- Inde sit, ut parvireferat sieve dicas,
Petra erat signum Christi, vel significabat Christum. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9.
Tract. 16.. Primum igitur, p. 118.
Salmeron will testify for us: In these speeches (says he) The seed is the
Word, I am the Door, The Rock was Christ; the Verb [Is, and WAS] must be
interpreted for SIGNIFIES, or figureth; not of it is own nature, but because
the word Rock cannot be otherwise joined with Christ, than by a figure or
sign. So he. Even as Master [Petra erat Christus.] Soletita exponi, Petra
significabat Christum, id non ita accidit quod verbum [Est] pro significat, ex
se collocetur, sed quoniam [Petra] illa aliter cum Christo cohaerere, quam per
similitudinem, and signum non potest. Sand. de Visib. Monar. ad Annum 1550. p.
141.
Sanders also is compelled to confess in a like Case.

CHALLENGE.
THus have we argued from Induction and Enumeration of Texts of Scripture, in
all like Sacramental Speeches: which Exposition, by Analogy of Scriptures, was
ever held of all Divines the most absolute and infallible manner of expounding
the Scripture that can be. The Truth whereof arieseth essentially out of the
Definition of a Sacrament, which as well the whole Catholic Church, as your
Romish, has defined to be a visible Sign. But no visible Sign can be joined
to any thing signified thereby, in like Predication, without a Figure, as has
been both copiously proved and confessed.

Our third Proposition, viz.

Many Figurative Speeches are used by Christ, even in his Words of Institution
of this Sacrament; by your own Confessions.

SECT. IV.
FIrst, your Jesuits (who otherwise shame not to call Protestants, in scorn,
Tropists, because they defend a Tropicall and Figurative sense in the speech of
Christ) are notwithstanding constrained to acknowledge many figures in other
words of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament, Lest that otherwise (as
Maldonate and Suarez Si proprie loqui velimus, falsae sunt istae Propositiones,
Corpus Christi manducatur a nobis, corpus Christi teritur, corpus Christi
devoratur, corpus Christi frangitur, quia ipsi modi, qui significantur his
verbis, non convenient corpori Christi; Sacramentalis locuti^ esset, si corpus
Christi dicer^tur frangi, aut dentibus teri: haec enim non possint, nisi
Sacramento tenus intelligi, quia non proprie corpus Christi frangitur, sed
Sacramentum. Mald. Ies. de Sacram. in gener. Tom. 1.. Quapropter p. 144. and
Com. in Matthew. 26. Frangi cum dicitur, est Metaphorica locutio, quia fractio
proprie significat divisionem, and discontinuationem partium, quam constat non
fieri in partibus corporis Christi. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. dis. 47. Sect. 4..
Exempla tertiae. page 577.
confess) the Speeches of Christ should be false: (as for example) When the
body of Christ is said to be broken, or eaten, if they should be taken properly
and without a figure called Metaphora. So they. And so in the words following,
[Body given for you] that is, which shall be offered for you on the Cross. So
your Jesuit Corpus quod pro vobis datur,] id est, quod offeretur pro vobis in
Cruce mactatum. Valent. Ies. l. 1. de Missa. c. 3.. Igitur. [Of the word Eat
literally false, so your Jesuits. See Book 5. C. 4.. 2.]
Valentia. Next, [The blood is shed for you] Matthew. 26. It is not denied (says
your Jesuit Graecus Textus [Effunditur:] Non est negandum morem esse
Scripturae, eam dicere jam esse, quae futurasit, ut hic [Effunditur] quia paulo
post in Crace effundendus. Salmer. Ies. in 1. Cor. 11. p. 154.
Salmeron) but that it is the manner of Scripture, to speak of a thing, as now
done, which is after to be done: as in this place, [Is shed] because very
shortly after it was to be shed upon the Cross. Which is the figure Enallage.
Again, [This Cup is the new Testament in my blood.] Hearken to your Hic Calix
est Novum Testamentu^] Non potest accipi in proprio sensu, sed in eo quem
clariora verba Matthaei and Marci indicant, and exigunt. Sive enim Calix
fumatur pro poculo potorio, five Synecdochice pro sanguine in poculo contento,
non potest consistere ut in ijs verbis sit propria locutio, -- Nemo enim
dixerit propria locutione vasculum illud potorium fuisse Testamentu^ Novum, cum
incertum sit, an adhuc extet illud poculum; at Novum Testamentum est aeternum:
sed nec^sanguis in Calice contentus potest esse novum Testamentum, quia lex
Evangelica in Epist. ad Hebr. dicitur Novum Testame^tum, and apud Matthaeum and
Marcum, sanguis dicitur Novi Testamenti. At vnicum est Novum Testamentum: Ergo
non est Novum Testamentum. Iansen. Conc. in cum locum, page 910.
Bishop; These words cannot be taken properly, whether the Cup be taken for the
vessel used for drinking, which was a temporal thing, and therefore could not
be the Testament of Christ, which is eternal: or else whether you take it for
the matter within the Cup (which is the figure Synecdoche) for, it being the
blood of the new Testament, could not properly be the Testament it self. Yea,
your Jesuit Salmeron points out in the same words a double Figure; Subest in
his duplex Meronymia: 1. quia continens ponitur pro contento, id est, poculum
sieve Calix provino, eo quod vinum in ipso continetur. 2. est, eo quod contentum
in poculo foedus vel Testam entum dicitur Novum, cum sit eius symbolum propter
species -- Testamentum hoc in loco potest sumi prolege Evangelica, quae veteri
legi opponitur, vel vtrem Testamento legatam testatamue significet. Quemadmodum
Haeres dicere solet, Hic fundus est testamentum patris mei, id est, port^o
haereditatis a patre meo legata; in quem sensum loquitur A postolus ad Hebr.
Iefus est sponsor melioris testamenti, id est, haereditatis. Salm. Ies. Tom. 9.
Tract 15.. Tertio p. 98.
A double figure (says he) the Cup being put for the thing contained in the
Cup: and Testament being taken for the Legacy that is granted, and given by the
Testament. With whom your Jesuit Testamentum sumitur prolegato Metonymice.
continens testamentum sumitur pro contento legato, seu haereditate, quae
testamento continetur. Barrad. l. 3. de Euch. c. 5. p. 79. Tom. 4.
Barradius does consent.

Hereunto may be added that in the sixth of John, where Christ calling that
which he gives to be eaten, his flesh, in the same Chapter he calls his
flesh, which is to be eaten of the Faithful, bread: which none of your side
durst hitherto interpret without a Figure. And yet again, the Apostle speaking
of the Mystical body of Christ, which is his Church, assembled at the holy
Communion, to participate of this Sacrament, says of them, 1. Cor. 10. 17.
We being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that
one bread. But why? Even as one bread consists of many corns, so does one
Church of Christ of many faithful persons, says your Sicut vnus panis ex
multis granis, etc. Aquinas in eum locum.
Aquinas.

We may not forget what your Iansenius said of See above Book (...). cap. 3..
8.
Drinking; To whom Master Master Brereley Liturg. Tract. 4.. 8.
Brereley is ready to yield his assent, saying; If we should attend to the
Propriety of speech, neither is his blood properly drunk out of the Chalice,
but only the form of Wine, seeing the blood has the same manner of Existing,
as under the form of bread, to wit, not divided, nor separated from the body,
but included in the veins, and then in the body. Do you not hear? Christ's
Blood is not properly drunk; if not properly, then figuratively; as
figuratively as if one, swallowing the body of Christ, should be said to drink
his Body. We ask Master Brereley, what then is that which is properly drunk
out of the Chalice? and he says, only the form of Wine, that is to say, a
mere Accident. Hardly can it be said that a man properly drinks the Air,
which he breaths, although it be a Substance; And are you brought to believe
mere Formalities, to be truly Potable? But to the point.

CHALLENGE.
REpeat now the Premises; One figure in the word [Bread:] another in [Eat:] a
third in [Given:] a fourth in [Shed:] a fifth in [Cup:] a sixth in [Testament:]
so many words confessed to be so many Figures in the very words of Christ his
Institution; beside other-more of the same equivalencie touching the Body of
Christ, both natural, Ioh. 6. and also mystical, which is his Church, 1. Cor.
10. It can be no less then a matter of great astonishment to us, to see our
Romish Adversaries with such pertinacie to condemn Protestants for holding the
Sacramental speeches of Christ to be figurative, calling them Tropists; when
as they themselves are constrained to acknowledge no fewer then Six Tropes in
Christ his words, as you have heard. Of your Cardinal his Objection, from the
word See hereafter. Book 6. Chap. 1.. 2.
Shed hereafter.

That the figurative sense of Christ's words is agreeable to the Judgment of
the more Ancient Church of Rome.

SECT. V.
YOur old and public Romish Gloss says plainly; Coeleste Sacramentum, quod
vere representat Christi carnem, dicitur Corpus Christi, sed improprie, unde
dicitur suo more, sed non rei veritate, sed significa^te mysterio: ut sit
sensus, vocatur Corpus Christi, id est, significatur. Gloss. Decret. de
Consecrat. did. (...). Can. Hoc est.
This heavenly Sacrament, because it does truly represent the flesh of Christ,
is called the body of Christ, but improperly, not in the truth of the thing,
but in the mystical Sense, to wit, it is called the body of Christ, that is,
it signifies his Body. So your Gloss, which you may not deny to be the gloss
or Tongue of your whole Church, because it has been confirmed by the same
Authority of Pope Gregorius XIII. Papa. In the privilege before the body of
the Canon Law.
Gregory the thirteenth, wherewith your Extravagants and former Decrees of
Popes have been Authorized.

CHALLENGE.
IF all Protestants should meeteat once in one Synod, and should conspire
together, as laboring to prove a figurative Sense in these words of Christ
[This is my body,] I suppose that a more exact, perspicuous, copious, and
ponderous Proof could not be defined, then hitherto has been evinced from
your own Confessions; grounded as well upon sound and impregnable Reasons, as
upon direct Testimonies of holy Scriptures.

That the former Figurative Sense of the words of Christ is agreeable to the
Judgment of Ancient Fathers, of the Greek Church.

SECT. VI.
YOu will needs defend your litterall Exposition by the verdict of Ancient
Fathers, and we appeal to the Venerable Senate both of Greek and Latin
Fathers. The Graeci Patres vocant Eucharistiam (...), quae lunt apud nostros
figurae, Sacramenta, Signa; and haec om^a (...) accepere. Alan. lib. 1. de
Euch. cap. 30 page 383. -- Dionys. c. 1. Eccle. Hier. Theod. Dial 1. Macarius

tropicis locutionibus, dicit Christum Iesum in Parabolis per typicae mensae
apparatum deifica mysteria tradere. Eodem modo Greg. Nazi. orat. 11. vocat
Antitypum pretiosi corporis and sanguinis Domini. Eusebius. lib. 8. Demonstrat. in
fine: Christus discipulos hortatur, ut sui ipsius corporis imaginem
repraesentent: Test Suarez. Tom. 3. in Thom. Quest. 74. disp. 46.. 4. page
547. and 552. -- Theod. dial. 1. cap. 8. Scis quod Deus (...). Luc. 22 (...) --
Ipseigitur Salvator noster (...). Paul^ post interrogando docet; (...).
[Origen. etiam in Matthew. 15. calls materiam panis, Symbolicum Corpus.]
Greek generally calling the Elements of bread and wine in this Sacrament;
Some, Types, Antitypes, and Symbols (that is) Figures and Signs: Some calling
Christ his Speeches Tropicall or Figurative; and his Table Typical: Some
saying that Christ would have his Disciples hereby Represent the image of his
Body. And one as expressly as any Protestant can speak (even Theodoret by
name) that Christ here gave to the Sign the name of his Body, as elsewhere he
gave to his Body the name of the Sign. You cannot deny but these Phrases of
Signs and Symbols are most frequent in the writings of all the Greek Fathers,
which we take to be a convincing Argument, until you can give us some
reasonable Solution hereunto. To this purpose you, leaving the principal
Objections, fasten only upon certain Crotchets, and thereupon you bestirre
your selves.

THE FIRST CHALLENGE,
Against the first Romish Answer, touching the word Type and Antitype, used by
the Greek Fathers.

THree kinds of Answers have been applied, as Three wedges to dissolve this
difficulty; but a knot of wood cannot be loosed with a wedge of wax, such as
every of your Answers will appear to be. The first interpreting Types and
Antitypes not to be taken for Signs, but for Examples, is at the first hearing
rejected by your Prima solutio; Vocem Antitypon non accipi pro signo, sed pro
Exemplari, etc. sed haec opinio facile reijci potest, quia vox ea nunquam
sumitur pro exemplar^. Bell. l. 2. de Euch. cap. 15.
Cardinal, and others.

The Second, alleged out of Damascen, and much insisted upon by some
favorers of your Romish Sense; namely, that the Fathers should call Bread and
Wine Antitypes; but not after Consecration. So they. And if so, then indeed we
should have no cause to oppose. But this Answer is proved to be apparently
false by your Alterasolutio est alioru^, Panem and Vinum Antitypon dici, sed
ante Co^secrationem non postea; it a respondit olim Ioh. Damasc. l. 4. de ^ide
c. 14. Et Epi. in 7. Syn. Art. 6. Tom. 3. sed invenimus apud Basiliu^

C. M.] -- Tamen Theod. apertissime eam sic vocat. Dial. 1. and Macar. Egypt.
Hom. 27. imo Dion. Areop. Eccl. Hier. c. 1. Naz. orat. in Gorgon. Bell. ibid.

Cardinal and others out of the express Testimonies of these Greek Fathers,
viz. Dio^ysius Areopagita, Clemens, Iustine, Macarius, Basil, and Nazianzene.
The third Answer is your Cardinals own, yet but faintly urged, with a
Foratassis Basilius and alij Graeci Patres non vocant typum aut figuram, sed
Antitypa, quia Antitypa non sunt quaelibet figurae, sed illa tantu^m, quae
nihil fere differunt a veritate. Bell. Ibid. quo supra.
Peradventure they called them Antitypes, but not Types after Consecration: and
he is encountered by your Negari non potest quin nonnunquam nomen Typi
inveniatur in Patribus, ut ex Hieronymo paulo ante notavi. Idem reperitur apud
Chrysostom. Hom. 16. ad Hebr. and Bilius apud Nazian. Annot. in or at. vndecimam,
in fine. Quare probabile valde existimo vocem Antitypi in eadem significatione
usurpari hoc loco, quo Typi, seu figurae. Suarez Ies. quo sup. p. 554.
Suarez and Billius, acknowledging that the words Types and Antitypes are used
of the same Fathers in one and the same signification. This our Objection how
strong it is, may be seen by your much, but vain struggling. Your quaintest
device is yet behind.

A SECOND CHALLENGE,
Against the last, and most peremptory Romish Pretense, making Christ in this
Sacrament to figure, and to represent himself, as a King in a Stage Play.

THe Solution, which seems to your Disputers most persuasive, is thus set
down by your Cardinal, and your Jesuit Suarez, viz. Solutio, Eucharistiam
etiam post Consecrationem dici posse Antitypum corporis and sanguinis Domini,
non solum quia species panis and vini sunt figurae corporis and sanguinis
Domini ibi rever a existentium, sed etiam quia corpus and sanguis Domini, ut
sunt sub illis speciebus, signa sunt ejusdem corporis and sanguinis, ut fuerunt
in-Cruce, repraesentant enim passione Christi: and ideo fortassis Basilius and
alij Patres non vocant Eucharistiam figuram aut typum, sed Antitypum etc. -- It
a si Rex aliquis, gravissimo bello confecto, idem ipsum bellum ad oblectamentum
populo in scen a praesens seipsum bellantem representare vellet. Bell. l. 2. de
Euch cap. 15. Antitypa corporis and Sanguinis Christi dicuntur, quia corpus and
sanguis Domini, ut sunt subillis speciebus panis and vini in Eucharistia, signa
sunt corporis passi, and sanguinis effusi in Cruce. Suarez. quo supra page 554.
Graeci Patres cum passim vocant Sacramenta Antitypa, -- nihil aliud sibi volunt
quam habere Sacramenta maximam similitudinem cum ijs rebus, quarum sunt
Sacramenta. Billar. lib. 1. de Sacram. in genere cap. 9.
The Greek Fathers called Bread and Wine Antitypes and Signs of the Body and
Blood of Christ, because the same Body and Blood of Christ, as they are in this
Sacrament under the form of Bread and Wine, are signs of the same his Body
and Blood, as they were on the Cross. Like as a King, who having gotten a
victory in battle, should represent himself in a Stage Play, as in a fight.
So They. But without any Sentence of any Father, for countenancing so egregious
a figment; so far were those Greek Fathers from urging that counterfeit
Testimony, which passes under the name of S. Augustine, as if he had said;
The flesh of Christ is a Sacrament of his flesh: and inferring from hence, that
The Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, is a Sign of it self as it
was upon the Cross.

And they are no small Babes, who vent out this proof; by name Billius com. in
Nazianz. orat. 11. Audiamus quid Augustinus dicit in Prosperi sententijs; Caro
inquit, ^ius est, quam forma panis opertam in Sacramento accipimus; sanguis,
quem sub specie vini potamus; Caro, viz. carnis, and sanguis Sacramentum est
sanguinis; carne and sanguine utroque invisibili, and intelligibili, and
spirituali significatur corpus Christi visibile, plenum gratiae, and divinae
Maiestatis. Gardener. Episc. Winton. Augustini verba, ut litera sonat,
intelligit. Item Claudius Saints Repetit, and allegari ai^, ut corpus Christi

sententiam apertissime tuetur Ro^fcns. and Johan. Hessell. Haec Billius.
Billius, Gardener Bishop of Winchester, Claudius Saints (one of name in the
Council of Trent) Fisher Bishop of Rochester, and Hessell. But how prove They
this? Out of any of the works of Augustine? No, where then? We are required to
seek it in Prosper; where again Trithemius. Ex sententijs Augustini, versibus
hexametris and pentametris mixtum opus prosa pulcherrimum quod prenotare
voluit, Epigramma, sic incipit, Dum Sacris, etc. [But of the other Entitled,

mention; yea, and even in this (as it is now set out among the works of
Prosper) printed Coloniae Agrippinae. An. 1609. apud Arnoldum Crithium, It is
not to be ^ound.]
it is not to be found. Whither next? forsooth it is so cited by Peter Lombard,
and there it appears that Peter Lombard had it out of his supposed Brother
Gratian; we say, Gratian, whose books have been lately reproved, and
condemned by one of your Antonius Augustinus Archiepiscopus Tarracon. De

all is done, if either Lombardus. Attend his diligenter, quia Tropo quodam

Gratian, who are the Relators, may be admitted to be the Interpreters of that
coined Sentence, they will say that the word Flesh, there specified, is taken
for the Shape of flesh; and the word Blood, for the outward form of Blood;
which spoyleth your Play quite: wherein you will have the Flesh of Christ under
the outward forms and shape in this Sacrament, and not the outward forms and
shape themselves, to be the Sign of the same Body on the Cross. So easy it
is for Hunters to pursue their Game with loud cries upon a false sent.

We return to your Cardinal, and to Suarez, who invented the Similitvde of
the Stage Play for their Answer, which is indeed rather a Childish Playing,
then Theological reasoning; yet it is but a mad sport to argue against
Conscience; as this your Cardinal must needs have done, who See above at (c.)
confessing that the Greek Fathers did therefore call Sacraments, Antitypes,
because of the great Similitude they have with the things they represent; yet
now adventureth to say, that the Body of Christ, as it is in the Eucharist, is
a Sign of the same Body of Christ, as it was upon the Cross; notwithstanding
the Body of Christ, as it is in the Sacrament, (according to your own faith)
is so Christi corpus, ut est in hoc Sacramento, nullo oculo humano, vel
intellectu Angelico videri potest. Suarez. Ies* Tom. 3. Disp. 53. Art. 7. 4.

Invisible, that it cannot be seen of Angels; so Indivisible, that it cannot
be parted or divided; and so Unbloody, that there is not the least tincture of
blood to be discerned therein.

Wherefore to persuade your Disciples, that those grave Fathers ever taught that
the Invisible, Indivisible, and Unbloody Body of Christ, as in this Sacrament,
was or could be the Sign of his visible, torn, crucified and bloody Body upon
the Cross, and so to note an Antitype, which is (as you call it) the Sea above
at (c)
Greatest Similitude, is all one, as to find out the greatest Similitude in the
greatest Dissimilitude: which yet is the more intolerable, because it is
against the Confessed Billius. Eucharistiae Sacramentum d^citur Antitypon, and

Common opinion of your own Divines, who have taught that The Sacrament of the
Eucharist is called Type and Antitype, because of the forms of Bread and Wine.
So your Billius. Man you not now discern the notable perverseness of your
Disputers, and that they devised this Stage Play, ad faciendum Populum, to
please and delude their Readers? thereby to fit themselves the better for the
Pageant; whereof we shall be occasioned to say more in the Book 6. c. 5.. 7.
sixth Book.

That the only Objection out of the Greek Fathers, concerning the Pronoune
[HOC] in the Testimony of Epiphanius, advantageth not the Romish Cause.

SECT. VII.
COmpare but Epiphanius his own Epiphanius in Ancorate. Videmus quod accepit
Salvator in manus, veluti Evangelista habet, quod surrexit a Coena, and accepit
haec, and cum gratias egisset, dixit; Hoc meum est, and hoc: and videmus quod
non aequale est, neque simile, non imagini in carne, non Invisibili deitati,
non lineamet is membroram, hoc enim rotundae formae est and insensibile quantum
ad potentiam, and voluit per gratiam dicere, hoc meum est, and hoc: and nemo
non fidem habet sermoni, qui enim non credit ipsum esse verum, excidit a gratia
and salute, Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 20.
words, your Cardinal's Cum docere vellet Epiphan. hominem ve^e factum ad
imaginem Dei, licet non facile appareat in quo consistat similitudo inter Deum
and hominem, cum Deus incorporalis sit, immensus; and dicit multa esse eiusmodi
quae aliud sunt, aliud videntur, ponit exemplum de Eucharistia, quae vere est
corpus Christi, and tamen nihil minus est, quam quod appareat exterius, cum sit
rotundum and insensibile, and proinde valde dissimile corpori Christi. Hic sanc
locus omnino convincit, nam quod dicit, oportet credere ipsum esse verum,
excludit Tropos, praesertim cum addat, excider^ a Salute qui non credit: quod
etiam ad dit credendum esse, licet sensus repugnent, apertissime testatur, non
eum loqui de significatione, sed de reipsa. [words to be observed in the Greek
are these. (...). [The last words show that Insensible is taken according to
power, that is actively]
Objection, and our Answer, and then make your own determination, as you
shall think good. Man is said to be made after the Image of God. Epiphanius,
not able to define what this Image consisted in, whether it be man's soul, or
mind, or virtue; notwithstanding resolves that c All men have the image of
God in them, but yet not according to nature, (namely, that substantial nature
which is in God) because God is Incomprehensible and infinite, etc. This is the
maine point which Epiphanius will now illustrate; but how? By something (says
your Cardinal) which seems to be that which it is not: And Epiphanius
instanceth in the Eucharist, wherein Christ taking into his hands those things
which the Evangelists do mention, he said of the one [HOC] This is mine, viz.
Body; and of the other, This is mine, viz. Blood: hereby understanding (says
your Obiector) The Eucharist, which is truly the Body of Christ, although it
seem not to be so, outwardly, being of a round figure, and Insensible, and
therefore far unlike to be the Body of Christ. So he. who, thinking he has
overcome, does raise up his Io^, and Triumph, saying; This argument is
thoroughly convincent, because Epiphanius adds, He who believes not the words
of Christ, does fall from Salvation: adding further, that they are to be
believed, although our senses gainsay it.

You have heard the Objection, which seeming to so great a Champion so greatly
Convincent, you will give us license to make a full Answer. First, by HOC ET
HOC, THIS AND THIS (by the Interpretation of Epiphanius) are meant, The things
which the Evangelist did mention; and the Evangelist mentioned (as you know)
Bread [He took Bread, He took the Cup:] meaning Wine in the Cup, namely,
according to the Sea above, Chap. 1 6.
former general Consent of the Fathers, HOC signified Bread, in one part of
the Eucharist, and Wine in the other; But Bread neither in the Substance, nor
in the Accidents can be called Christ's Body without a Trope, as has been
See above, Chap. 1.. 4.
Confessed: which is our first confutation of your Cardinal, who concludes
that Epiphanius excludes all Tropes out of Christ's speech of [HOC.] Secondly,
THIS, in the words of Christ, has neither equality of Proportion, nor yet
similitude of form or figure. (being round) with the body of Christ, as
Epiphanius wills us to observe. Which confuteth the Assumption of your
Cardinal, affirming that Epiphanius sought in the Eucharist a similitude of a
Thing, which seemed to be that which it is not; Albeit Epiphanius expressly
shows, that there is no outward similitude between This and This spoken of,
that is to say Bread and Wine, and that which is called, Mine, and Mine,
namely, The Body and Blood of Christ. Thirdly, This spoken of by Christ (in the
Judgment of Epiphanius) as it is Round in figure, so is it (...), Insensible;
but not passively, as not perceiveable by sense, (for then it could not be said
to be Round, which with other outward Accidents are sensible to your selves,)
but actively Insensible, as not having power sensibly to perceive: which
betokening Bread or the Accidents of bread (as you see it does) confirms unto
us the Tropicall speech of Christ, in calling Bread his Body; and consequently
overthrows your whole Cause. Fourthly, the Similitude of Epiphanius must
stand thus; That which is said to be after the Image of God, is such, which
has a substantial being, yet so that it be like, but not the same in nature:
And so is Bread, having a Sacramental Analogy to Christ's Body, the first as
the substantial meat of man's Body, and the other as the supersubstantiall
food of Man's Soul.

Which Conclusion, namely, that Bread, as the sign of Christ's Body, is not
the same in nature with Christ's Body, does dash out the brains of the Monster
Transubstantiation; by the which, Bread (as your Tridentine Faith teaches) is
wholly changed into the substantial nature of Christ's Body. As if you would
have Epiphanius to have said, The Image of God in man, is God in nature. Thus
do you find the Testimony of Epiphanius to be Convincent indeed, but against
your Romish Doctrine, of Error; and against your Cardinal, of a foul
falsity, who says that Epiphanius will have us to believe something herein,
although it be repugnant to our Senses: which word no man of Sense can find in
Epiphanius. He says, indeed, that every man is bound upon his Salvation to
believe the Truth of Christ his Speech; which say we none but an Infidel can
deny, because Christ being Truth it self, therefore all the words of Christ,
whether spoken Literally or Tropically, they are still the Truth of Christ.

That the same Greek Fathers have expressly unfolded their meanings, touching a
Figurative Sense.

SECT. VIII.
THe Judgment of a whole Council of Greek Fathers may well suffice for the
manifestation of the Judgment of that Church; They in Constantinople at
Trullo, alluding to these words of Christ, [This is my Body] saying, Let
nothing be offered, but the Body and Blood of Christ, that is (say In sanctis
nihil plus quam corpus and sanguis Christi offeratur, ut ipse Dominus tradidit,
hoc est panis and vinum, aqua mixtum. Council. Constant. apud Binium [which
Canon was made against the Aquarij (those who would use no wine) Can. 32.]
They) Bread and Wine, etc. If we had not told you that this had been the
speech of Greek Fathers in a Council, you would have conceived they had been
uttered by some Heretic, as your Charity uses to call us Protestants. Neither
may the Authority of this Council be rejected by you, as unlawful in the
point of the Sacrament, both because it is objected by your selves, to prove it
an unbloody Sacrifice (whereunto you are See hereafter in the Sixth Book, C.
5.. 9
answered) as also for that your Binius, in opposing against some things in
this Council, yet never took any Exception against this Canon.

We may not let pass another Testimony used by the Ancient Father See above,.
6. (x.)
Theodoret, namely, That Christ called the Bread his Body, as he called his
Body Bread, Matthew. 12. saying thereof, Except the grane of wheat die, etc.
insomuch that Interchangeably in the one place He gave to the Sign the name of
his Body, and in the other, He gave to his Body the name of the Sign. So he.
As Protestantly as either Calvin or Beza could speak. And you cannot deny, but
that when Christ called his Body Bread, it was an improper and figurative
speech. And therefore, if you will believe Theodoret, you are compellable to
confess, that Christ, in calling Bread his Body, meant it not in a proper and
literal sense. Hitherto of the Greek Fathers.

That the same Figurative sense of Christ's words is avouched by the Latin
Fathers.

SECT. IX.
SOme of the Latin Fathers (we confess) seem in some places to deny all
Figurative sense, but this they do even by a figure called As is afterward
many where is discovered.
Hyperbole, that is, only in the excess of Speech, thereby to abstract the
minds of sensual men from fixing their thoughts upon external Rites, and to
raise them up to a Sacramental and Spiritual Contemplation of the Body and
Blood of Christ. But as for the direct and perspicuous Sentences of these
Fathers, they clearly and exactly teach a figurative sense in the words of
Christ, to wit, Tertull. contra Marcion. l. 4. Id est, figura corporis. p. 291.
Tertullian, [This is my Body:] That is a figure thereof. Cyprian. S^rm de
Vnct. Et significantia, and significata ijsdem vocabulis censerentur.

quas repraesentant, plerunque etiam ipsarum rerum nomina accipiunt; Sicut ergo
secundum quendam modum Sacramentum Corporis Christi, Corpus Christi, and
Sacramentum sanguinis Christi, Sanguis Christi, it a Sacramentum fidei fides
est. -- Sicut de ipso baptismo ait, Consepulti sumus per baptismum in mortem
Christi, non dicit, sepulturam significamus, sed prorsus ait consepulti sumus.
Sacramentum igitur tantae rei non nisi eiusdem rei vocabulo nuncupavit. [And
Interpreting that which he called Fidei Sacramentum, He says, Respondetur,
Parvulum baptizatum credere propter fidei Sacramentum.]
Saint Augustine in many places may be unto Us instar multorum: To eat the
flesh of Christ (says he) is a figurative speech. Again. In the banquet,
Christ gave to his Disciples the sign of his Body. And yet again, Christ
doubted not to say, This is my Body, when he gave a sign of his Body. Lastly
(unanswerably) proving other Sacraments to agree with this, in this point, and
that herein the Eucharist has no Prerogative above the rest; Sacraments (says
he) for the very Similitude and likeness, which they have with the things
whereof they are Sacraments, do often take the names of those things, which
they do signify; as when the Sacrament of Christ's Body (says he) is after a
certain manner called the Body of Christ. But how? He adds (as if he had
meant to stop the mouths of all Opposites,) As it is said by the Apostle of
Baptism [we are buried by Baptism into the death of Christ] He says not, we
signify his burial, but absolutely says, [Wee are buried:] therefore has he
called the Sacrament or Sign of so great a Thing by the name of the Thing
signified thereby. So he, even the same He who will be found like himself in
the following passages of this Book, especially when we shall handle the
manner of Eating of Christ's body, which Augustine will Afterward Chap. 3.. 6.
Challenge to be figuratively meant.

We shall take our farewell of the Latin Fathers, in the Testimony of Bishop
Isid. Hispalen: Panis, quem frangimus corpus Christi est, qui dicit, Ego sum
panis vivus, etc. Vinum autem sanguis eius est, and hoc est quod scriptum est,
Ego sum vitis vera: Sed panis, quia confirmat corpus ideo corpus Christi
nuncupatur, vinum autem quia sanguinem operatur in carne, ideo ad sanguinem
Christi refertur. -- Haec autem sunt visibilia, sanctificata tamen per Spiritum
Sanctum, in Sacramentum divini corporis transeunt. l. 1. de offic. c. 18.
Isidore, who will give you his own Reason, why Christ called Bread his Body:
Bread (says he) because it strengthens the body, is therefore called the
body of Christ, and Wine because it makes Blood is therefore referred to
Christ's Blood: but these two, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, are changed
into a Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ. So he: and so say we.
Accordingly Tertullian; but (least any may Cavil, as some do, at his sentence
above cited) we add his other sentence, wherein he Tert. advers. Marcion. l.
3. p. 180 ^er. 11. [Venite, mittamus lignum in panem eius.] Vtique in corpus,
sic enim Deus in Evangelio, panem corpus suum appellans: ut and hinc iam
intelligas corporis sui figuram panem dedisse, cuius ret^o corpus in panem
Propheta figuravit.
shows that Christ called Bread his Body in saying, [This is my body] as the
Prophet Jeremy called his Body Bread, in saying, Let us put wood upon his
Bread, meaning his Body. So Tertullian, showing them both to be spoken equally
in a figurative Sense.

CHALLENGE.
THese Sentences of these holy Fathers are so fully Consonant to the Doctrine
of Protestans, as that, if the names of these Fathers had been concealed, our
Reader might think that he heard, Bucer, Calvin, or Beza speak. Go you now
and proclaim, that all Ancient Fathers teach your Litterall sense of Christ
his words, and persuade your selves, if you can, that any man of Conscience and
Judgment can be seduced to believe you. They say, indeed, that Bread is the
Body of Christ: and why might they not use the same Tenure of Speech, which our
Lord Christ used before them? But they say also that Bread is therefore called
his Body, as being an outward Sacrament, Sign, and Figure of his Body; seeing
that every Sacrament, being a Sign or Figure, the Sacramental Speech must
necessarily be Figurative; as has been proved by Scripture, as in all other
Sacraments, so likewise in the several confessed Figurative words of Christ
concerning this Sacrament, in six several Instances. This one Argument of it
self has been termed by Master Calvin [Murus ahaeneus,] that is, a brazen
Wall; and so will it be found more evidently to be, when you shall perceive the
same Fathers Lib. 3. throughout.
judging that, which they call Change into Christ's flesh, to be but a Change
into the Sacrament of his flesh, Bread still remaining the same: and teaching
that Melchisedech offered in his Sacrifice the Body and Blood of Christ, when
he offered only the Types of both; in the Lib. 6. Chap. 3.. 2.
Sixth Book. And now we are to with-stand your Paper-bullets, wherewith you
vainly attempt, in your Objections following, to batter our Defense withal.

CHAP. III.
The Romish Objections, against the Figurative Sense, Answered.

The first Objection.

SECT. I.
NOthing uses to be more properly and simply spoken, (say Primum Argumentum
sumitur a materia, est enim materia, de qua hic agitur, Pactum, Sacramentum,
Testamentum Novum: fuisse a Domino institutum patet ex illis verbis [Hic est
calix Novi Testamenti in sanguine meo] -- I am vero nihil solet magis proprie,
simpliciter, aut exquisite explicari quam Testamentum, ne viz. detur occasio
litigandi. Pacta seu foedera sunt etiam ex codemgenero, quae exquisitissime and
proprijs verbis explicantur, nelocus ullus relinquatur cavillis. Sacramentum
hoc effe, de quo agitur, nemo negat, -- Sacramentum autem solere a Deo institui
proprijs verbis, ut in little usu non erretur. Bellar. l. 1. de Euch. c. 9..
Primum and. Deinde. and. Porro Sacramentum.
you) than words of Testaments and Covenants. Ergo this being a Testamentary
Phrase must be taken in the literal Sense.

CHALLENGE.
WHat is this? are Figurative speeches never used in Covenants, and
Testamentary Language? or is there not therefore sufficient perspicuity in
Figures? This is your rash and lavish Assertion, for you your selves do teach
that In ipsa Scriptura dicitur Testamentum and Instrumentum -- Quia pacta Dei
and foedera inita nobiscum continent, ut patet in pacto Circumcisionis cum
Abrahamo. -- Ante omnia praefamur S. Scripturam uti Metaphoris, non solum ob
utilitatem nostram, sed etiam propter necessitatem, a pluribus Patribus
traditur. Sacram Scripturam de Deo, de Trinitate, de Patre, Filio, and Spiritu
Sancto, proprie loqui non posse, -- Quando sermo est de vita aeterna, and
praemio filiorum Dei, claris rebus comparatur, per Tropos est explicandus. --
ut August. ait, Nullogenere locutionis, quod in consu^tudine humana reperitur,
Scripturae non utuntur, quia utique hominibus loquuntur. Salmer. Ies. Proleg.
l. 1. p. 3. and 4. and lib. 21. p. 371, and 227, 229, 231, 234.
The Old and New Testament are both full fraught with multitude of Tropes and
Figures, and yet are called Testaments. Secondly, That the Scripture, speaking
of the Trinity and some divine things, cannot but speak improperly and
figuratively. Thirdly, That Sacramental speeches, as, [The Rock was Christ,]
and the like words are See above, Chap. 2 Sect. 3. (e,)
Tropicall and Figurative. Fourthly, That even in the Testamentary Speech of
Christ, at his Institution of this Sacrament, saying, [This Cup is the New
Testament in my Blood:] there is a Figure in the very word See above, Chap. 2
Sect. 4. (p. q.)
Testament. So have you confessed, and so have you consequently confuted your
own Objection.

Hereto might be added the Testament of Jacob, prophesying of his sons, and
saying, Gen 49.
Reuben is my strength: Judah a Lions Whelpe: Issachar a strong Ass: Danan
Adder in the way. All figurative Allusions. Nay, no man in making his Testament
can call it his Will, or say that he has set his hand and Seal unto it,
without Figures: Namely, that he has given by writing a Signification of his
Will; that the Subscription was made by his Hand; and that he added unto it the
Print of his Seal. These Three, Will, Hand, Seal, every word Figurative, even
in a Testament.

The Second Romish Objection, against the Figurative Sense.

SECT. II.
Laws and Precepts (say Verba Legum and praeceptorum debe^t esse propria.
Bellar. l. 1 de Euch. c. 9.. Sequitur.
you) should be in plain and proper words. But in the Speech of Christ, [Take,
eat you, etc.] are words of Command. Ergo, They may not be held Figurative.

CHALLENGE.
CAn you be Ignorant of these Figurative Precepts, viz. of Pulling out a man's
own eye, of cutting off his hand? Matthew. 5. Or yet of a Penitents Renting of
his heart? Joel 2. Or of not hardening his heart? Psalm. 95. and the like.
Christ commanded his Disciples to prepare for his keeping the Passover with
his Disciples, and the Disciples prepared the Passover as Jesus commanded
them, says the Luc. 22. 8.
Evangelist. In this Command is the word [Passeover.] We demand, The word,
Passover, (which is taken for the Sacrament and Sign of the Passover) is it
taken figuratively? You cannot deny it. And can you deny that a Commandment
may be delivered under a Figurative Phrase? You can both, that is, say and
gainsay any thing, like false Merchants, only so far as things may, or may
not make for your own Advantage.

But (to catch you in your own snare) your Doctrine of Concomitancy is this,
viz. Bread, being turned into Christ's Body, is jointly turned into whole
Christ; and Wine, being changed into his blood, is likewise turned into whole
Christ, both flesh and blood. If then when Christ commanded his Disciples,
saying, [ Matthew. 26. 27.
Drink you All of this,] that which was Drunk was the whole substantial Body
of Christ, either must his Disciples be said to have Drunk Christ's Body
properly, or else was the Command of Christ figuratively spoken. To say the
first, contradicts the universal expression of man's speech in all
Languages; for no man is said to drink Bread or any solid thing. And to grant
the Second, that the speech is Figurative, contradicts your own Objection.
Again, Christ commanded to Eat his Body; yet notwithstanding have Three See
above, Chap. 2. 4. (l.)
Jesuits already confessed that Christ's Body cannot be said to have been
properly Eaten, but figuratively only. What fascination then has perverted
your Judgments, that you cannot but still confound your selves, by your
contrary and thwarting languages?

Your Third Romish Objection.

SECT. III.
DOctrinall and Dogmaticall speeches (say Praecipua dogmata etc. Bellar. quo
sup.. Denota.
you) ought to be direct and literal: But these words, [This is my Body] are
Doctrinall.

CHALLENGE.
A Man would marvel to hear such silly and petty Reasons to be propounded by
those, who are accounted great Clerks, and those who know full well that the
speech of Christ, concerning Castrating or gelding of a man's self, is Abule^
in cum loc^^. Christus non laudat eos qui castrarunt se, sed qui se cast ant,
concupiscentiam abscindedo -- ut Chrysostom. Non membrorum abscisione sed malarum
cogitationum increpatione: maledictioni nempe obnoxious, qui membrum sibi
abscindit. Idem habet Hier. Addit Chrysostom. super Matthew. Abscissis vi^il^bus
non tollitur co^cupiscentia; Concupiscentia inde fit molestior.
Doctrinall, and teaches Mortification; and yet is not literally to be
understood, as you all know by the literal error of Idem. Origines seipsum
castravit, ut posset liberius praedica^e tempore Persecutionis, and s^^urius
esse inter foeminas. Abul. super Matthew. 5. qu. 250. p. 326.
Origin, who did really Castrate himself. And the same Origin, who thus
wounded himself by that literal Exposition, in his youth, He in his Age,
expounding the words of Christ, concerning the Eating of his flesh, said of the
literal sense thereof, that, Origin. Littera hae^ occidit. in Levit. Hom. 7.
It kills. Secondly, these words [This is the New Testament in my blood,]
they are words as Doctrinall as the other [This is my body:] and yet
figurative, by your own See above Chap. 2.. 4.
Confession. Thirdly, the words of Christ, Ioh. 6. of Eating his flesh are
Doctrinall; and yet by your own Verus and literalis Sensus horu^ verboru^ non
est quod caro Christi nihil prodest, sed quod carnalis intelligentia nihil
prodest, ut exponunt Chrysostom. Theophyl. Euthem. Origin. Cyprian, and alij:

distinguitur a spirituali cogitatione. Bellar. l. 1. de Euch. c. 14.. Sed
praeterea.
Construction, are not to be properly understood, but as Christ afterward
expounds himself Spiritually. Fourthly, where Christ thus said, The bread,
which I shall give, is my flesh, Ioh. 6. 51. he says also of his Body, that it
is True bread, Verse 32. and bread of life, Verse 48. and living bread, whereof
whosoever eats lives eternally, Verse 51. All, Divine and Doctrinall
Assertions, yet was his body figuratively called bread. Fifthly, that in those
words of Christ to Peter, Matthew. 16. Upon this Rock will I build my Church;
And, To thee will I give the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; And Ioh. 21. Feed
my Sheep; (In which texts of Scripture you place, although most falsely, your
Doctrinall foundation of Popedom it self:) yet know you all these to be
Tropicall Speeches. Yea and what say you to the first Doctrinall Article, and
foundation of Christian Doctrine, delivered by God unto man, in the beginning,
Genesis 3. 15.
The seed of the woman shall break the Serpents head? Is not the latter part
of the Article altogether Figurative, yet signifying this Doctrinall point,
even the vanquishing of the power of Satan?

Your Fourth Romish Objection.

SECT. IV.
THe Apostles (says your Bell. Apostoli rudes and simplices erarie etc. Lib. 1
de Euch. 6. 9.. Argumentum secundum.
Cardinal) were rude and simple, Therefore needed to be Instructed by Christ
in plain terms, without Figures. So he.

CHALLENGE.
ANd yet Christ, you know, did often speak Figuratively unto them, talking of
Bread, Leaven, Seed, etc. And stiling them the Salt of the earth; yea even in
this Sacrament (as has been confessed) in the words, Eat, Shed, Testament.
Another Jesuit witnesses, that Apostoli a Christo edocti fuerunt, and
illuminati, ut cum summa re^ere^tia Sacramentum hoc susciperent. Suarez. Ies.
Tom. 3. Disp. 46*. 3.
The Apostles were illuminated and instructed by Christ; that they might
receive this Sacrament with all Reverence. So he. Therefore are they but rudely
by you termed Rude; and the rather because They (who being commanded to
prepare the Passover, perceived that by Passover was figuratively understood
the Paschall Lamb, and thereupon prepared the Passover, according to the
Lord's Command) could not be ignorant, that in this like Sacramental speech
[This is my body] the Pronoune [THIS] did literally point out bread, and
figuratively signify Christ's body. Doubtless, if the manner of Christ's
speech in the Eucharist had not been like the other in the Passover, they
would have desired Christ to explain his meaning, as they did sollicitously in
other doubts.

Their last Romish Objection.

SECT. V.
WE are never to let pass the Literal Sense (says your Nunquam dimitcamus
proprium verborum sensum, nisi cogamur ab aliqua alia Scriptura, etc. Bell. l.
1. de Euch, Cap. 9.. Vltimo.
Cardinal) except we be compelled thereunto by some Scripture, or by some
Article of Faith, or by some common Interpretation of the whole Church. So he.

CHALLENGE.
SVrely nor we, without some one of these; but that you may know the grounds of
our persuasion to be more than one, or yet all These; And how bountifully we
shall deal with you, we shall show in the Proposition following.

Ten Reasons, for proof of the Necessity of interpreting the word^ of Christ
Figuratively.

SECT. VI.
FIrst, We have been compellable to allow a Figurative Sense by the consessed
Analogy of Scripture, in all such Sacramental Speeches of both Testaments,
concerning Circumcision, Rock, Baptism; as also that speech of Christ, Ioh.
6. Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, as you have See above C. 2..
3.
heard. Secondly, We are Challengable hereunto by our See hereafter, B. 6.
Chap. 3.. 10.
Article of Faith, which teaches but one natural Body of Christ, and the same
to Remain now in Heaven. Thirdly, We are enforced, for fear of such See
hereafter, B. 8. Chap. 4.
Heresies as have followed in other Cases, upon the literal sense; for it was
not the Figurative but the literal and proper sense of being borne again, by
Baptism, (lob. 3.) that begat the error of Nicodemus; and the like literal
sense of God's Eyes, Hands, Feet, etc. brought forth the Anthropomorphites; And
so was it the literal sense of those words in the Canticles [Tell me where
thou lie at noone] which deluded the Donatists; and of Origin you have heard,
that he by the literal sense of these words, [Some there be that castrate
themselves, etc.] did fondly wrong himself.

Fourthly, We are necessarily moved, to reject your literal sense, by a
confessed Impossibility, taught by that Universal Maxim, See above Chap. 1..
4.
Disparatum de disparato, etc. showing that Bread, being of a different nature
from flesh, can no more possibly be called the flesh or Body of Christ,
literally, than Lead can be called Wood. Fifthly, We are persuaded hereunto by
the former alleged Interpretation of the Ancient Fathers, both of the Greek
and Latin Church, calling the Sacrament a Figure; and expounding [This is] by
[This signifies.] Sixthly, We are urged by the Rule set down by Saint
Augustine, for the direction of the whole Catholic Church; that, Si
praeceptiva locutio flagitium aut facinus videtur iubere, figurata est, ut
[nisi ma^ducaveritis carnem meam] facinus videtur iubere, ergo figura est,
praecipiens passioni Domini esse communicandum, and suaviter, ac utiliter
recolendum in memoria, quia pro nobis caro ^ius crucifixa, and vulnerata ^it,
August. de Doctrina Christ. l. 3. c. 16.
Whenever the precept (says he) seems to command that which is heinous (as
to eat the flesh of Christ) it is figurative. And of this Sacrament does not
Christ say, Take, Eat, This is my body? Seventhly, A Motive it must needs be
to any reasonable man, to defend the figurative sense, by observing the misery
of your Disputers, in contending for a literal Exposition thereof; because
their Objections have been confuted by your own Doctors, and by Truth it
self, even the holy Scriptures. Eighthly, your own Unreasonableness may
persuade somewhat, who have not been able, hitherto, to confirm any one of
your five former Objections to the contrary, by any one Father of the Church.
Ninthly, For that the literal Interpretation of Christ's words was the
foundation of the Heresy of the Capernaites, and has affinity with diverse
other See the last Book Chap. 2.. the last.
Ancient Heresies condemned by Antiquity. Tenthly, Our last persuasion is the
consent of Antiquity against the literal conversion of Bread into Christ's
body (which you call Transubstantiation) against the Literal Corporal
Presence, against Literal Corporal Eating, and Union, and against a proper
Sacrifice of Christ's body Subiectively. All which are fully persuasive
Inducements to enforce a figurative sense, as the sundry Books following will
clearly demonstrate from point to point.

CHALLENGE.
YOu may not pass over the consideration of these points, by calling them
Schoole-subtilties, and Logical Differences, as Master Fisher lately has
done; thinking by this his sly Sophistry, craftily to draw the minds of
Romish Professors from the due discovery of your Romish false literal
Exposition of Christ's words, [THIS IS MY BODY:] the very foundation of your
manifold monstrously-erroneous, Superstitious, Heretical, and Idolatrous
Consequences issuing from thence, whereunto we now orderly proceed.

THE THIRD BOOK,
Treating of the First Romish Doctrinall Consequence, pretended to arise from
your former depraved Exposition of Christ's words, [This is my Body] called
TRANSVBSTANTIATION.

Your Doctrinal Romish Consequences are Five, viz. the Corporal 1. Conversion
of the Bread into the Body of Christ, called Transubstantiation; in this Third
Book. 2. Existence of the same Body of Christ in the Sacrament, called Real
Presence; in the Fourth Book. 3. Receiving of the Body of Christ into the
Bodies of the Communicants, called Real, or Material Conjunction; in the
Fifth Book. 4. Sacrificing of Christ's Body, by the hands of the Priest,
called a Propitiatory Sacrifice; in the Sixth Book. 5. Worshipping with Divine
Worship, called Latria, or Divine Adoration of the same Sacrament; in the
Seventh Book. 6. The Additionals in a Summary Discovery of of the
Abominations of the Romish Mass, and Iniquities of the Defenders thereof; in
the Eight Book.

THese are the Doctrinall Consequences, which you teach, and profess, and
which we shall by (God's assistance) pursue, according to our former Method of
Brevity, and Perspicuity; and that by as good, and undeniable Evidences, and
Confessions of your own Authors, in most points, as either you can expect, or
the Cause it self require. And because a Thing must have a Begetting, before
it have a manner of Being, therefore before we treat of the Corporal
Presence, we must in the first place handle your Transubstantiation, which is
the manner (as we may so say) of the Procreation thereof.

CHAP. I.
The State of the Controversy, concerning the Change and Conversion, professed
by Protestants, which is Sacramental; And by the Papists defined to be
Trans-substantiall.

SECT. I.
First of the Sacramental.

THere lies a Charge upon every Soul, that shall communicate and participate
of this Sacrament, that herein he Discern the Lord's Body: which Office of
Discerning (according to the judgment of Protestants) is not only in the use,
but also in the Nature to distinguish the Object of Faith from the Object of
Sense: The First Object of Christian Faith is the Divine Alteration, and Change
of natural Bread, into a Sacrament of Christ's body; This we call a Divine
Change, because none but the same See hereafter, Cap. 4.. 1.
Omnipotent power, that made the Creature and Element of Bread, can Change it
into a Sacrament.

The Second Object of Faith, is the Body of Christ it self, Sacramentally
represented, and verily exhibited to the Faithful Communicants. There are then
three Objects, in all, to be distinguished. The First is before Consecration,
the Bread merely Natural. Secondly, After Consecration, Bread Sacramental.
Thirdly, Christ's own Body, which is the Spiritual, and Super-substantiall
Bread, truly exhibited by this Sacramental, to the nourishment of the souls
of the Faithful.

Secondly of the Romish Change, which you call Transubstantiation.

SECT. II.
But your Change in the Council of Est conversio totius substantiae Panis in
Corpus Christi, and totius substantiae vini in sanguinem, man^tibus duntaxat
speciebus Panis, and Vini, quam quidem Conversionem Catholica Ecclesia
aptissime Transubstantiationem appellat. Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. (...).
Trent is thus defined: Transubstantiation is a Change of the whole Substance
of Bread into the whole Substance of the Body of Christ, and of Wine into his
Blood. Which by the Bull of Ego N. N* juro hanc Conversionem fieri, quam
Catholica Ecclesia appellat ran^stantiatione^ -- Extra quam fide^ nemo salvus
esse potest. Bulla Pij 4 super forma Iuramenti Prosessionis Fidei.
Pius the Fourth, then Pope, is made an Article of Faith, without which a man
cannot be saved. Which Article of your Faith Protestans believe to be a new and
impious Figment, and Transubstantiationem Protestants esse sceleratam Haeresin
dicunt. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. cap. 11.
Heresy. The Case thus standing, it will concern every Christian to build his
Resolution upon a sound Foundation. As for the Church of England, she
professes in her 28. Article, saying of this Transubstantiation, that It
cannot be proved by holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of
Scripture, overthrows the nature of a Sacrament, and has given occasion unto
MANY SVPERSTIONS.

CHAP. II.
The Question is to be examined by these ground; viz.I. Scripture. II.
Antiquity. III. Divine Reason.

IN all which we shall make bold to borrow your own Assertions, and
Confessions, for the Confirmation of Truth.

The Romish Depravation of the Sense of Christ his words, [This is my Body:]
for proof of Transubstantiation.

SECT. I.
YOu pretend (and that with no small Confidence) as a Truth avouched by the
Council of Vt definitur in Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 4. Ex sola veritate
verborum [Hoc est Corpus meum] vera, ac propria Transubstantiatio colligitur.
Vasquez. Ies. Disp. 176. c. 6. Verba tam perse clara cogere possint hominem non
protervum Transubstantiationem admittere, Bell. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 23. Secundo.
Trent, that Transubstantiation is collected from the sole, true, and proper
Signification of these words [This is my Body.] So you.

CHALLENGE.
Wherein you show your selves to be men of great Faith, or rather Credulity,
but of little Conscience; teaching that to be undoubtedly True, whereof
notwithstanding you your-selves render many Causes of Doubting. For first you
Scotus, quem Cameracensis sequitur, -- Dicunt non extare locu^ in Scripturis
tam expressum, ut sin^ declaratiore Ecclesiae evidenter cogat
Transubstantiationem admittere. Atque hoc non est omnino improbabile, quia an
it a sit dubitari potest, cum homines acutissimi, and doctissimi, qualis
inprimis Scotus fuit, contrarium sentiant. Bellar. quo supra. Cajetanus, and
aliqui vetustiores audiendi non sunt, qui dicunt, panem desinere esse, non tam
ex Evangelio, quam ex Ecclesiae authoritate constare. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch. c.
34. page 419.
grant that (besides Cardinal Cajetane, and some other Ancient Schoolmen)
Scotus, and Cameracensis, men most Learned and Acute, held that There is no one
place of Scripture so express, which (without the Declaration of the Church)
can evidently compel any man to admit of Transubstantiation. So they. Which
your Cardinal, and our greatest Adversary, says See in the former Allegation
at (b.)
Is not altogether improbable; and whereunto your Bishop Corpus Christi fieri
per consecrationem, non probatur nudis Evangelij verbis, sin^ pia
interpretatione Ecclesiae. Roffens. Episc. con. Capt. Bab. cap. 9. page 99.
Roffensis gives his consent. Secondly, (which is also confessed) some other
Doctors of your Church, because they could not find so full Evidence, for
proof of your Transubstantiation, out of the words of Christ, were driven to
so hard shifts, as to [Hoc est] pro Transit, Bonaventura docet. Idem fere habet
Occam, and Holcott, infinuat etiam Waldensis. -- Volunt Propositionem illam non
esse substantive, sed Transitive interpretandam, sc. ut sit sensus [Hoc est
Corpus] id est, Transit in Corpus. -- Sed hoc corrumpit significationem verbi
[Est] quod si permittitur, nulla est vis in huiusmodi verbis ad probandam
realem praesentiam nec substantiam Panis hic non manner. Et ita potuit
Haereticus exponere [Hoc est] id est, Repraesentat Corpus. Suarez. Jes. Tom. 3.
qu. 78. Disp. 58. Sect. 7. A^t. 1. page 754.
Change the Verb Substantive [Est] into a Verb Passive, or Transitive, Fit,
or Transit; that is, in stead of [Is] to say, It Is Made, or, It passes into
the Body of Christ. A Sense, which your Jesuit Suarez cannot allow, because
(as he truly says) It is a Corrupting of the Text. Albeit indeed this word
Transubstantiation imports no more than the Fieri, seu Transire, of Making,
or Passing of one Substance into another. So that still you see
Transubstantiation cannot be extracted out of the Text, without violence to the
words of Christ.

We might, in the third place, add hereunto that the true Sense of the words
of Christ is Figurative, as by Scriptures, Fathers, and by your own confessed
Grounds has been already plentifully * proved, as an Infallible Truth. So
groundless is this chief Article of your Romish Faith, whereof more will be
said in the sixth Section following. But yet, by the way, we take leave to
prevent your Objection. You have told us that See the former Book throughout.
the words of Christ are Operative, and work that which they signify; so that
upon the pronuntiation of the words [This is my Body,] it must infallibly
follow, that Bread is changed into Christ's Body; which we shall believe,
as soon as you shall be able to prove, that upon the pronuntiation of the other
words of Christ [This Cup is the new Testament in my Blood,] Luc. 22. 20. the
Cup is changed into the Testament of Christ's Blood, or else into his Blood it
self.

The Novelty of Transubstantiation examined, as well for the Name, as for the
Nature thereof.

SECT. II.
The Title, and Name of Transubstantiation proved to be of a latter date.

YOu have imposed the very Title of Transubstantiation upon the Faith of
Christians; albeit the word Transubstantiation (as you grant) Fateor, neque
Antiquos Patres usos esse hoc nomine Transubstantiationis. Christoph. de Capite
fontium, Archi^p. Caesar. lib. de reali Praesent. cap. 59. art. 4.
was not used of any Ancient Fathers; and that your Romish Change had not it is
Christendom, or name among Christians to be called Transubstantiation (as your
Cardinal Conc. Lateran ense sub* Innocentio Tertio coactum, ut Haereticis os
obthuraret, Conversionem hanc novo and valde significante verbo dixit
Transubstantiationem. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 34. p 422. As for that objected
place out of Cyrill of Alexandria Epist. ad Coelosyrium [Convertens ea in
yeritatem Carnis:] It is answered by Vasquez the Jesuit; non habetur illa
Epistola inter opera Cyrilli. Vasquez. in 3. T^om. Tom. 3. number. 24.
Alan witnesses) before the Council of Laterane, which was 1215. years after
Christ; nor can you produce One Father Greek or Latin, for a Thousand years,
attributing any word equivalent, in strict Sense; unto the same word
Transubstantiation, until the year 1100. (which is beyond the Compass of due
Antiquity) At what time you find, note, and ^rge Theophylact; who says of
the Bread, that It is Trans-elementated into the Body of Christ. Which Phrase,
in what Sense he used it, you might best have learned from himself, who in
the very same place says that Christ in a manner is Theoph. in Ioh. 6. De
Christo perfidem manducato, [(...)]
Trans-elementated into the Communicant: which how unchristian a Paradoxe it
were, being taken in strict and proper Sense, we permit to your own judgments
to determine.

Neither yet may you, for the countenancing of the Noveltie of this word,
object the like use of this word [(...)] as though it had been in use before
the Arian Controversy began, because the Fathers of the Council of Nice
judged the Objection of the Novelty of that word Calumnious; for that the use
of it had been Ancient before their times, as your Cardinal Calumniam hanc
Patres Antiqui aptissime confu^atunt, atque ostend^runt non inventum fuisse hoc
nomen [(...)] in Concilio Nicaeno, sed fuisse ante in usu Patrum; at illud iam
vocabulum vsur pari, quo sui Maiores usi fuissent. Bellarm. quo supra. c. 3.
Bellarmine himself witnesses.

You furthermore to prevent our Objection (demanding why the Ancient Fathers
never called your fancied Romish Change, Transubstantiation, if they had been
of your Romish Faith, concerning the Substantial Change of Bread into the Body
of Christ) have shaped us this Answer, namely, that Etsi veteres Ecclesiae
Doctores non sint usi vo^^ Tra^substantiationis, tamen usi sunt vocibus idem
significantibus, ut Conversioni^, Transmutationis, Transitionis,
Transformationis, Transelementationis, and similibus. Lorich. Fortalit. fidei
Tract. de Eucharist.. Nota pro solutione Argumentorum. fol. 117.
Although they used not the very word, Transubstantiation, yet have they words
of the same signification, to wit, Conversion, Transmutation, Transition,
Transformation, Trans-elementation, and the like. So your Lorichius, Reader of
Divinity among you; who by his vast and rash boldness might as justly have
inferred from the like Phrases of the Apostle, viz. [ 2. Cor. 3. 18.
(...), we are transformed] that every Regenerate Christian is
Transubstantiated into Christ: or, from the word [ 2 Cor. 11. 14.
(...), He is transfigured] say that the Devil is Transubstantiated into an
Angel of light: or from the word [(...), It is changed] (used by Quicquid
Spiritus Sanctus te^igerit, and Sanctificat (...). Cyrill. Hieros. Catech. 5.
Cyrill) urge that whosoever the Spirit of God does Sanctify, is
Transubstantiated into another thing: or from the word [(...)] in (...).
Nazianz. Orat. 40. p. 643. Edit. Paris.
Nazianzene, conclude that Every Person Baptized is Transubstantiated into
Christ.

Will you have the world imagine that so many, so excellent, and so Ancient
Fathers, with all that Divine and Humane Learning wherewith they were so
admirably accomplished, could not in a Thousand years space, find out either
the Greek word, (...), or the Latin Transubstantiatio, and apply them to this
Change, if they had once dreamed of this your Article of Faith? Will you permit
us to learn a point of wisdom in your Cardinal? Periculosa est vocum nova^um
Libertas in Ecclesia, cum paulatim ex vocibus nov^ eriam res oriantur, cum
cuique licet in rebus Divinis nomina ^ingere. Bell. lib. d^ Sacram. in Genere.
c. 7.. Ex quibus,
Liberty of devising new words (says he) is a thing most dangerous; because
new words, by little and little, b^get new things. So he. Therefore may we
justly place this your new word among those (...), which St. 1. Tim. 6. 20.
Paul will have Christians by all means to avoid; else so new and barbarous a
name must needs engender a novell, and brutish opinion, such as this Article it
self will appear to be; As follows.

The Novelty of the Article of Transubstantiation is examined, and shown not
to have been before the Council of Laterane (namely) not until 1215. years
after Christ.

SECT. III.
THis Aricle has been decreed (as you have See above Chap. 1.. 2.
heard) by your Church, as a necessary Doctrine of Faith; and therefore
presumed to be Ancient.

CHALLENGE.
THe first Imposition of this Article, as of Faith, your Cardinal Bell. l. 3.
de Euch. cap. 23.. Vnum tamen.
Bellarmine notes to have been in the days of Pope Gregory the VIIth. viz.
1073. years after Christ. But surely at that time this could be but a private
opinion of some few, for Peter Lombard (living 67. years after this Pope, and
esteemed the Master of the Romish School) when he had labored to give
Resolution to all doubts, especially in this very Question (whether the
Conversion were substantial, or not) confesses plainly saying: Si quaeratur,
qualis sit Conversio (viz. Panis in Eucharistia) an formalis, an substantialis,
an alterius generis; definire non sufficio. Quibusdam videtur esse
substantialis, dicentibus substantiam converti in substantiam. Lomb. Sent. lib.
4. distinct. 11. lit. (a.)
Definire non sufficio: I am not able to Determine. So he. Anno 1140.

Hitherto therefore this Article was but in Conception only, which caused your
learned and subtle Schoole-man Scotus to descend lower, to find out the Birth
thereof, Scotus dicit ante Council. Lateranense non fuisse dogma fidei
Transubstantiationem. Id ille dixit, quia non legerat. Conc. Romans sub Gregorio.
7. nec consensum Patrum, quem nos produximus. Bellar. lib. 3. de. Euchar. cap.
23.. Vnum tamen.
Affirming that the Article of Transubstantiation was no Doctrine of Faith
before the Council of Laterane, under Pope Innocent III. viz. Anno 1215. whom
therefore your Cardinal does tax for want of Reading. But either were your
Jesuit Coster, and Cardinal Perron as ignorant of Ancient Learning, as
Scotus, or else they gave small Credit to that Council cited by Bellarmine
under Gregory the VIIth. For your Jesuit says, in direct terms, that Ante
trecentos Annos in Conc. Lateran. ad istius rei tam admirabilis clariorem
explicationem usurpatum fuit nomen Transubstantiationis: ut intelligant
Christiani substantiam Panis in substantiam corporis Christi converti. Coster.
Ies. Enchir c. 8.. De Transubstantiatione.
The name of Transubstantiation was used in the Council of Laterane, for
clearer declaration, that Christians might understand the Change of Bread into
the Body of Christ. Can you say then that it was universally so understood
before? But your Cardinal Perr^n more peremptorily concludes that Si nihil
plane ad Doctrinam Ecclesiasticam spectans in Cone. Lateran. ex communi Patrum
assensu Decretum esset sequeretur posse ^t falsum impugnari Articulum de
Transubstantiatione. Card. Per. ensa Harangue au tiers Estats p. 33. As
witnesses our P. Preston alias Widdrington Discuss. Conc. Later. part. 1.. 1.
page 12.
If it had not been for the Council of Laterane, it might be now lawful to
impugn it. So he. A plain acknowledgement, that it was no Doctrine of Faith
before that Council, even as Scotus affirmed before, But we pursue this Chase
yet further, to show,

That the Article of Transubstantiation was not defined in the Council of
Laternae, under Pope Innocentius the III.

SECT. IV.

Historians viz. Platina, Nauclerus, Godfridus Monumetensis, Matthew. Paris, and
others to testify as follows. That many things fell under Consultation in
that Council, but nothing was openly defined, the Pope dying at Per^sium.
Insomuch that some of these Authors stick not to say that This General
Council, which seemed to promise bigg and mighty matters, did end in scorn
and mockery, performing nothing at all. We might add that the supposed Acts
of this Council were not published until more than two hundred years after.
No marvel then if some Scholastici quidam have Doctrinam de
Transubstantiatione non valde Antiquam esse dixerunt: inter quos Scotus, and
Gabriel Biel. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 50. 1.
Schoolmen, among whom were Scotus and Biel, held Transubstantiation not to
have been very ancient. And another, that In Synaxi sero definivit Ecclesia
Transubstantiationem, diu satis erat Credere sive sub pane, sive sub quocunque
modo adesse verum Corpus Christi. Eras. in 1. Cor. 7. page 373.
It was but lately determined in the Church. Nay, M. Breerly (if his opinion be
of any Credit among you) sticks not to say that Mr. Breerly in his Liturgy
Tract. 2.. 11. page 158.
Transubstantiation complete (that is, both for form, and matter) was not
determined until the last Council of Trent; that is to say, not until the
year of our Lord 1560. Do you not see how much licking this ougly Bear and
Beast had, before it came to be formed? and yet it will appear to be but a
Monstrum horrendum, take it at the best; as it is now to to be proved, by the
full discovering of the palpable Falsehood thereof.

CHAP. III.
The Definition of Transubstantiation, in the Church of Rome; and of the
Falsehood thereof.

SECT. I.
THe Council of Trent (says your Conc. Trid. dicit, fieri Conversionem totius
substantiae Panis, id est, tam formae, quam materiae in Substantiam Corporis
Christi. Bell. lib. 3. de Eucharist. Chap. 18.. Si Objicias. Council. Trid.
Sess. 13. Cap. 4.
Cardinal) has defined that this Conversion is of the whole Substance of
Bread, that is, as well form, as matter, into the Substance of Christ his Body.

Our First proof of the Falsehood of the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, by the
Contradictions of the Defenders thereof; whereby they bewray their No-Beleefe
of the Article.

THe Opinions of the Doctors of your Church, concerning the nature of this
Conversion, are by you reduced into these two manners, (namely) that it is
either by Production out of the substance of Bread; or else by Adduction of the
Body of Christ unto the form of Bread.

CHALLENGE.
Whatsoever it is, which you will seem to profess, never shall you persuade
us that you do indeed believe either of the pretended Forms of
Transubstantiation. First, not by Production, because (as the same Productio
est, quando Terminu^ ad quem non existir, and ideo vi Conversionis necessario
producitur, ut aqua in vinum: Adductiva auterm, etc. Bell. ibid.. Secundo
notandum. -- Productiva non est, quia Corpus Domini praeexistit. Idem ibid..
Exhis.
Cardinal truly argues) Conversion by Production, is, when the thing that is
produced is not yet extant; as when Christ converted water into wine, wine was
not Extant before it was Produced out of the substance of water: But the Body
of Christ is always Extant; therefore can it not be said to be Produced out of
the substance of Bread. So he. Which Productive manner of Transubstantiation
could not be believed by your Jesuits De rarione Transubstantiationis non est,
ut Substantia, in quam dicitur fieri Transubstantiatio, producatur aut
conservetur perillam: imo qui hoc modo defendunt Transubstantiationem in
Sacramento, ad quod dam genus Philosophiae excogitatum, potius quam ad verum
and necessarium, rem reducere videntur. Vasq Ies. To. 2. disp. 214. c. 4.
Vasquez, and Praeter Adductiuam Conversionem evidenter refutavimus omnes modos
Conversionis, qui vel dici, vel fingi possunt. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. qu. 7^.
disp. 50. 5. Tertio Principaliter. [M. Fisher in his Reioynder talks fondly
of a Reproduction, as of Careases converted into men, in which Change any One
may see that as much as is Produced is not Extant, for Dust is not Flesh. But
since he cannot apply this Reproduction to Transubstantiation of Bread into the
Body of Christ, his Answer is impertinent, and he may be produced for an idle
Disputer.]
Suarez, by both whom it has been confuted. And if the Change be not by
Production, then it must follow that it is not by Transubstantiation; which is
demonstrable in it self, because the next manner, which they insist upon,
cannot possibly serve your turn.

This Second manner they name to be by Adduction, which your Si Terminus ad
quem Corpus Christi existat, sed non in co loco ubi Terminus a quo (i. e.
Panis) tum ui Conversionis adducetur ad eum locum. Inde vocatur Conversio
adductiva: nam corpus Christi praeexistit ante Conversionem, sed non sub
speciebus Panis. Conversio igitur non facit ut corpus Christi simpliciter esse
incipiat, sed ut incipiat esse sub speciebus: non quod per motum localem e
Coelo Adducatur, sed solum quia per hanc co^versione^ fit, ut quod ante erat
solum in Coelo, iam fit sub speciebus Panis. Nec haec Accidentalis Conversio,
sed substantialis dicta est, quia substantia Panis definit esse, and substantia
corporis Christi succedit Pani. Proinde Substantia in Substantiam transit.
Talis est Conversio Cibi in hominem, per nutritione^; nam anima non producitur
sed tantum per nutritionem fit, ut incipiat esse in ea materia, ubi antea erat
forma Cibi. Bell. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 18.
Cardinal defines to be a Bringing of the Substance of that Body of Christ,
continuing still in heaven, to be notwithstanding at the same time under the
shapes of Bread on the Altar, and therefore called Substantial, but the
Substance of Bread, cease to have any Being, when the Body of Christ
succeeds to be under the outward shapes of Bread. So he. And this is of late
crept into the opinion of some few, whereby you have created a new faith, flat
contrary to the faith of the Council of Trent, which defined a Change of the
whole substance of Bread into the Substance of the Body of Christ. So that
Council, as you have heard. Now by the Change of Substance into Substance, as
when Common Bread eaten is turned into the Substance of Man's flesh, the matter
of Bread is made the matter of Flesh. But this your adduction is so far from
bringing in the Substance of Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body, that it
professes to bring the Body of Christ not so much as unto the Bread, but to be
under only the Outward Accidents, and forms of Bread. Yet had this Figment
some Favorers in your Fuerunt huius sententiae Alens. Bonavent. Marsil --

No Marvel therefore if there arose some out of your own Church, who did
impugn this delusion, calling it (as your Dixi Conversionem Panis in Corpus
Christi esse Adductivam, quod dictum video a nonnullis esse perperam acceptum,
qui inde non Transubstantiationem, sed Translocationem colligunt. Sed dixi
corpus Christi non deseruisse locum suum in Coelo, neque incipere esse sub
speciebus, ut in loco, sed ut substantia sub Accidentibus, remota tamen
inhaerentia. Bellar. Recog. in lib. 2. de Euch. p. 81.
Cardinal himself witnesses of them) a Translocation only, and not a
Transubstantiation; and that truly, if they should not have called it a
Trans-accession, or Trans-succession rather. For who will say, if he put on his
hand a Glove, made of a Lamb-skin, which Lamb was long since dead (and
consequently ceasing to be) that therefore his hand is Transubstantiated into
the Body of the Lamb? yet is there in this example a more substantial Change
by much, than can be imagined to be by your Adduction of a Body under only the
Forms and Accidents of the matter of Bread, because there is in that a
Material Touch between the Substance of the hand, and the Lamb-skin: but in
this other there is only a Conjunction of the Substance of one Body with the
Accidents of another. Which kind of mere Succession of a Substance your
Jesuit Suarez will allow to be no more than a Per solam Adductivam actionem
revera non explicatur vera Conversio Substantialis and Transubsta^tiatio, sed
^an^^m Tra^slocatio quaedam: quando una Substantiasuccedit loco alterius, non
potest proprie dici unam converti in aliam. Suarez. loco citat. p. 639.
Translocation.

We Conclude that seeing Conversion, whether by Production, or by Adduction,
are so plainly proved by your selves to be contrary to Truth: therefore it is
not possible for you to believe a Doctrine so absolutely repugnant to your own
knowledge.

Observe by the way that they, who gainsay the Productive, and teach the
Adductive, yet do all deny Local mutation a Termino ad Terminum: a Paradox
which we leave to your wisdoms to contemplate upon.

Our Second Proof of the Falsehood of the Article of Transubstantiation is from
the Article of our Christian Creed, [BORNE OF THE VIRGIN MARY.]

SECT. II.
TRansubstantiation (as has been defined by your Council of Trent) is a
Conversion of the substance of Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body. Now,
in every such Substantial Change, there are Two Terms, one is the Substance
from which; the other is the Substance whereinto the Substantial Change is
made: as it was in Christ his miraculous Change of Water into Wine. But this
was by producing the Substance of Wine out of the Substance of Water, as the
matter, from which the Conversion was made. Therefore must it it be by
Production of the Substance of Christ's Body, out of the Substance of Bread.
Your Cardinal has no Evasion, but by denying the Conversion to be by
Production, which notwithstanding was formerly the General Tenet of the Romish
School, ever since the Doctrine of Transubstantiation was hatched; and which
is contrary to his own device of Conversion by Adduction: wherein first he
Dico Corpus Christi ex pane fieri, non tanquam ex materia, sed tanquam a
Termino a quo, ut mundus ex nihilo, [then confuting himselfe] e^iam ut ex aqua
vinum (that was not ex nihilo.) In pr^senti negotio, Conversio non est
Productiva. Panis enim co^vertitur in Corpus Christi praeexistens: ergo Corpus
Christi factum ex Pane, and ex Carne est idem. Bell. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 24..
Ad Tertium.
confounds himself, and secondly, his opinion has been scornfully rejected
by your own learned Doctors, as being nothing less than Transubstantiation,
as you have heard. Therefore may you make much of your breaden Christ. As for
us, We, according to our Apostolical Creed, believe no Body of Christ, but
that which was Produced out of the Sanctified flesh of the blessed Virgin Mary,
for fear of Alphonsus de Castro lib. 4. Ti^. Christus. haeres. 2. Manichaei

Heresy.

This same Objection being made of late to a Jesuit of prime note, received
from him this Answer: viz. God that was ableto raise Children to Abraham out of
stones, can of bread transubstantiate the same into that Body of Christ, which
was of the Virgin. And he again received this Reply; That the Children, which
should be so raised out of Stones, howsoever they might be Abraham's Children,
according to Faith, yet could they not be Children of Abraham according to the
Flesh. Therefore is there as great a Difference between that Body from Bread,
and the other from the Blessed Virgin, as there must have been between
Children out of Stones, and Children out of Flesh.

And this out Reason accords right well to the Ancient Faith, professed
within this Land, in the days of Edgar a Saxon King, as it is set out in an
Homily on Easter day, page 35.
Homily of that time, which being published stands thus. Much is between the
body that Christ sufferedin, and between the body of the hallowed Howsell: The
body truly that Christ suffered in was borne of the flesh of the Virgin Mary
with blood, and with bone, with skin, and with sinews in humane limbs; and
his Ghostly body, which we call his Howsell, is gathered of many Corns,
without blood, and bone, without limb, and therefore nothing is to be
understood herein bodily, but all is Ghostly to be understood. This was our
then Saxon's Faith; wherein is plainly distinguished the Body of Christ borne
of the blessed Virgin from the Sacramental (which is called Ghostly) as is the
Body of flesh from the Consecrated Substance of Bread. A Doctrine directly
confirmed by See Book 4. C. 4.. (...). in the Challenge.
Saint Augustine. Wherefore we may as truly say, concerning this your
Conversion, that if it be by Transubstantiation from bread, then it is not the
Body, which was borne of the blessed Virgin; as your own Romish Gloss could
say of the Predication: See above, Book 2. Chap. 1. 4.
If Bread be Christ's Body, then something was Christ's body, which was not
borne of the Virgin Mary.

Our Third Reason is taken from the Existence of Bread in this Sacrament, after
Consecration.

But first of the State of this Question.

SECT. III.
WE wonder not why your Fathers of the Council of Trent were so fierce in
casting their great Thunderbolt of Si quis dixerit remanere Substantia^ Panis,
Anathema sit. Conc. Trident. Sess. 13. Can. 2.
Anathema, and Curse upon every man that should affirm, Bread and Wine to
remain in this Sacrament after Consecration: which they did, to terrify men
from the Doctrine of Protestants, who do all affirm the Continuance of the
Substance of Bread in the Eucharist. For right well did these Tridentines know,
that if the Substance of Bread, or Wine do remain, then is all Faith, yea,
and Conceit of Transubstantiation but a feigned Chimaera, and mere Fancy, as
your Cardinal does confess, in granting that Panis etsi non annihiletur,
tamen manet nihil in se; ut Aqua post Conversionem in vinum. Neque obstat, quod
forte materia manserit, na^ materia non est Aqua. Prima Conditio in vera
Conversione est, utid, quod convertitur, desinat esse. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch.
c. 18.. Igitur. and cap. 24. Ad Alterum.
It is a necessary Condition, in every Transubstantiation, that the thing,
which is Converted, cease any more to be; as it was in the Conversion of Water
into Wine; Water ceased to be Water. And so must Bread cease to be Bread. This
being the State of the Question, we undertake to give

Good Proofs of the Existence, and Continuance of Bread in the Eucharist, the
same in Substance, after Consecration.

Our First Proof is from Scripture, 1. Cor. 10. Saint Paul calling it [Bread.]

SECT. IV.
IN the Apostle his Comment (that I may so call his two 1. Cor. 11. 26, 27. and
10. 16.
Chapters to the Corinthians) upon the Institution of Christ, we read of
Eating the Bread, and Drinking the Cup, thrice; all which, by the consent of
all sides, are spoken of Eating and Drinking after Consecration: and yet has
he called the outward Element Bread. You will say (with some) It was so called
only because it was made of Bread; as Aarons Rod, turned into a Serpent, was
notwithstanding called a Rod. But this Answer is not answerable unto the
Similitude. For first, of the Bread, the Apostle says demonstratively, This
Bread; and of the other, This Cup: But of Aaron's Rod, turned into Serpent,
none could say, This Rod. And secondly, it is contrary to Christian Faith,
which will abhor to say, in a proper sense, that Christ's Body was ever
Bread. Or else you will answer, with others, It is yet called Bread, because
it has the Similitude of Bread, as the Brazen Serpent was called a Serpent.

But neither this nor any other of your Imaginations can satisfy; for we shall
prove, that the Apostle would never have called it Bread after Consecration,
but because it was Substantially, still, Bread. Our Reason is; He had now to
deal against the Prophaners of this Sacrament, in reproving such as used it as
Common Bread, 1. Cor. 11. 21.
Not discerning therein (Sacramentally exhibited) the Lord's Body. It had
therefore concerned him to have honored the Sacrament with Divine Titles,
agreeable to the Body of Christ, hypostatically united to his Godhead, and to
have denied it absolutely to have been Bread, considering that by the name of
Bread the glory of the same Body might seem to be abased, and Ecclipsed; if in
Truth, and Verity he had not believed it to have been (then) Bread.

This Reason we guess you are bound to approve off, who, in your opinion of
the Corporal Presence of Christ his Body, and Absence of Bread, would never
suffer any of your Professors to call it, after Consecration, by the name of
Bread. Whereupon it was that the Greek Archiep. Cabasila. Latini nostros
rehendunt, quod post illa verba [Hoc est Corpus meum] Panem and Vinum nominant,
etc. Exposit. Liturg. c. 29.
Archbishop Cabasila complained of the Romish Professors, for reprehending the
Greek Liturgies: why? Because (says he) after the words of Christ, [This is
my Body] we call the Symbols and Signs Bread, and Wine. So he. Which
bewrays that the very naming of the Sacrament Bread, and Wine is, in the
judgment of the Church of Rome, prejudicial to their Transubstantiation; and
that if Saint Paul himself should deliver the same words he did, at this day,
he should by your Romish Inquisitors be taught to use his Terms in another
style. What need many words? except in the words of Christ the word [Body] be
properly predicated, and affirmed of Bread, farewell Transubstantiation of
Bread into Christ's Body! But that it is Impossible the Body of Christ should
be properly predicated upon Bread, has been the General Confession of your
own Doctors, and the Conclusion of our second Book.

Our Second Proof of the Continuance of the Substance of Bread is from the
speech of Christ, touching the Continuance of Wine, after Consecration, Matthew.
26. 29. by the Interpretation of Antiquity.

SECT. V.
THe same is as fully verified by our Lord and Master Christ himself, in
thesecond Element of Wine, calling it Matthew. 26. 29.
This fruit of the Vine, that is, Wine, after Consecration: where the Pronoune
[This] has relation to the Wine in the Cup. For the proof of this our
Exposition of the words of Christ, we have the Consent of these and thus many
holy Fathers; Origin, Cyprian, Chrysostom, Augustine, Hierome, Epiphanius,
Euthymius, Theophylact, and Bid, as witnesses your Jesuit Origenes,
Cyprianus, Chrysostom. August. Hieron. Epiphan. Beda, Euthym. Theoph. [Genimen
vitis] ad sanguinem Christi referunt -- Maldon. Ies. Com. in eum locum; where
he adds: Persuadere mihi non possum haec verba ad Sanguinem esse referenda.
-- Hoc Patres, sed alio sensu a Calvinistis, qui dicunt Christum vinu^
appellasse, quia vinum erat; sed Patres vocaruntsanguinem Vinum, sicut Christus
Carnem 10. 6. vocabat Panem. Maldo. in eund. locum. Haec, ne illi Calvinistarum
errori affinis esse videatur. Maldon. Ibid.
Maldonate (no one Father produced by him to the contrary) Then answering; But
I (says he) cannot be thus persuaded. So he. Mark this (you great Boasters
of Accordance with Antiquity!) and yet this manner of answering the Fathers is
most familiar with this Jesuit. But he proceeds, telling you that The
Fathers notwithstanding did not call it Wine, as thinking it to be Wine, but
even as Christ did when he called his flesh Bread, John 6. Then he adds;
They that will follow the Exposition of These Fathers are thus to interpret
them. And gives his Reason of this his Advertisement, Lest the other Exposition
(says he) may seem to agree with the opinion of the Calvinists. So he.

For which his Answer Calvinists* are as much beholding to him, as are the
Ancient Fathers, with whom he has made bold not only to reject their
Authority; but also to pervert the plain and evident meaning of their
Testimonies; who declare that they understood Natural and Substantial Wine
(as the Novum promisit, id est, Novum quendam modum sumptionis in regno, id
est, post resurrectionem, quando Cibum sumpsit corporalem. Theoph. in Matthew.

Marginals do manifest) so plainly, as to affirm that It was Wine, which then
Christ drank, and that hereby the practices of the Heretics Aquarij are
confuted, who would drink nothing but Water in the Eucharist. It was the Wine
(says August. de dogmat. Eccles. c. 75 Vinum fuit in redemptionis nostrae
mysterijs, cum dixit [non bibam.]
Augustine) which was used in the mysteries of our Redemption: Even that Wine,
which was blessed (says Clem. Alex. Quod Vinum esset, quod benedictum fuit,
oftendit rursus dicens, [Non bibam de fructu Vitis.] Lib. Paedag. 2. cap. 11.
sub finem.
Clemens Alexandrinus:) and your own Bishop Cum Matthaeus, and Marcus nullius
alterius Calicis fecerint mentionem praeter sacri, quod dicitur [De genimine
Vitis] nullus alius Calix intelligi potest ab ijs demonstratus, quam cujus
meminerant -- Et omnino videtur ex Matthaeo and Marco dictum hoc post
consecrationem. Iansen. Episc. Concord. in cum locum, p. 914 col. 2.
Iansenius does confess that these words of Christ had reference to the Cup in
the Eucharist; and not (as some say) to the Cup of the Passover.

Mark you furthermore the Error of the Aquarij, and the Confutation thereof:
they used only Water in the Eucharist, in pretense of See above, Book 1. Chap.
3.. 10.
Sobriety, which Cyprian confuted only upon this ground, viz. that this
Practice was not warranted by the Sea above, Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 3. And
here above in the Margent.
Institution of Christ, wherein Christ ordained Wine, and not Only Water: and
now tell us, if that your Doctrine of Transubstantiation had been an Article
of Faith, in those days, whether it had not concerned Cyprian to have stood
exactly upon it, for the more just condemnation of those Aquarij, to let them
know, that if they would needs use only Water, than (according to your
Doctrine) their Consecration should be void; and consequently their Adoration
(if it had been then in use) should have been like wise Idolatrous.

The former Proof confirmed by Analogy, between Bread and Christ's Body,
both Natural, and Mystical.

SECT. VI.
IN 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17. [The Bread which we break (says the Apostle) is it
not the Communion of the Body of Christ? for we being many are one Bread and
one Body, in as much as we all partake of one Bread.] In this Sentence the
word [Bread] has a double Relation, the First to Christ his Body Natural.
Thus the joint Participation of the Bread is called the Communion of the Body
of Christ. The Analogy, in this respect, is excellently expressed by Panis
quia confirmat Corpus, ideo Corpus Christi nominatur: Vinum autem, quia
sanguinem operatur, ideo ad sanguinem refertur. Haecautem duo sunt visibilia,
sanctificata autem per Spiritum sanctum, in Sacramentum divini Corporis
transeunt. Isidor. Hisp. de Offic. Lib. 1. cap. 18. See above, Book 2. Chap.
1.. 9. (at x.)
Isidore: Bread (says he) because it strengthens the Body, is therefore
called Christ's Body; and Wine, because it turns into Blood, is therefore
called Christ's Blood: These two are visibles, but being sanctified by the holy
Spirit, are turned into a Sacrament of Christ's Body. So he. This is indeed a
true Analogy, not to be performed by Accidents.

Could any of them, whom you call Calvinists, have spoken more significantly
either in contradicting your Exposition of Christ's words (for he says that
Christ called Bread his Body;) or in declaring the true proper Sense of the
Sacramental Conversion? (for he says, Bread is Changed into a Sacrament of
Christ's Body;) or else in giving the Reason why Bread, and Wine were chosen
to be Sacraments and Signs of Christ's Body, and Blood, by which we are
spiritually fed? (for he shows that it is because of their Natural Effects,
Bread substantially, and therefore not Accidentally, strengthens Man's Body:
Wine turns in Blood.) Which overthrows your third Figment of only
Substantia Panis non pertinet ullo modo ad rationem Sacramenti, sed solum
Accidentia. Beilar. Lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 23.. Respondeo substantiam.
Accidents; as if the Substance of Bread and Wine, were not necessary in this
Sacrament. Say then, does the Accident of Roundnesse and Figure of Bread
strengthen man's Body? or does the Accident, Color of Wine, turn into Blood?
As well might you affirm the only Accident of Water in Baptism to be
sufficient to purge and cleanse the Body, by the color, and coldness, without
the substantial matter thereof.

The Second part of the Analogy is discerned in the Mystical Body of Christ,
which is the Congregation of the Faithful Communicants; [ 1. Cor. 10 17.
We are all one Body, in as much as we are partakers of one Bread.] It stands
thus; As many Granes of Corn make one Loaf of Bread, and many Grapes make one
measure of Wine in the Cup: So, many Christians, partaking faithfully of this
Sacrament, become One mystical Body of Christ by the Union of Faith, and Love.
This Exposition, as it is yielded unto by your Cardinal Vnus Panis, unu^
Corpus multi sumus, nam omnes in uno Pane participamus.] Significatur vnitas
fidei in vnitate Panis, ac unitate Corporis Metaphorice, ad similitudinem
multoru^ granorum, ex quibus con^icitur Corpus vnum. Et attulit Pane^ propter
id, quod dixit [Panis quem frangimus] Caietan. Card. in ^um locum. page 137.
Cajetan, and authorized by your Roman and Tridentine Vnum Ecclesiae corpus ex
multis me^bris compositum est: nulla re elucet ea Coniunctio magis, quam Panis
Vinique elementis. Panis enim ex multis granis conficitur, and Vinum ex
multitudine racemorum existit. Ita fidelis, etc. Catech. Roman. part. 2. de
Euch. page 177.
Catechism, so is it also confessed to be used of Augustinus. Dominus noster
Christus, inquit, Corpus suum in ijs rebus commendavit, quae ad unum aliquod
rediguntur: ex multis enim granis Panis efficitur, ex multis racemis unum
Corpus confluit; ut^ntur hac similitudine Sancti prope omnes Doctores. Test
Bozio de Signis Ecclesiae Tom. 2. lib. 14. cap. 6.
Almost all holy Doctors. He was held a most expert and artificial Painter,
in Pliny, that could paint Grapes so to life, as to deceive Birds; which came
to feed on them: But they are the only Sophistical Doctors, that offer in the
Eucharist only Accidents, as painted Colors in stead of natural, because
where there is not a Real Analogy, there is no Sacrament. You may not say,
that the Analogy consists in the matter before Consecration; because every
Sacramental Analogy is between the Sacrament, and the Thing Signified, but
it is no Sacrament, before it be Consecrated.

CHALLENGE.
SAy now, what Better Author is there than Christ? What better Disciple and
Scholar, than the Apostle of Christ? or what better Commentary upon the words
of Christ, and his Apostle, than the Sentences of Ancient Fathers? calling the
one part Wine, the other Bread, after Consecration, as you have heard.

Our Third Proof, that the Substance of Bread remains after Consecration in
the Sacrament, is taken from the Judgment of Sense necessarily.

First, by the Authority of Scripture.

SECT. VII.
ALthough man's Sense may be deceived, through the inconvenient Diposition of
the Medium, through which he sees, as it happens in judging a straight Staff
to be Crooked, which stands in the Water; and in thinking a White Object to
be Green in it self, which is seen through a Green glass: or Secondly by
the unequal Distance of place, as by conceiving the Sun to be but two feet
in breadth; or the Rainbow to be a Color, and not Light; or Thirdly by some
defect in the Organ, or Instrument of seeing (which is the Eye) whereby it
comes to pass that we take One to be Two, or mistake a Shadow for a
Substance: yet notwithstanding when our Eyes that see are of good Constitution,
and Temper; the Medium, whereby we see, is perfectly disposed; the Distance of
the Object, which we see, is indifferent; then (say we) the judgment of Sense,
being free, is True, and the Concurrence and joint Consent of diverse Senses, in
one arbitrament, is infallible.

This Reason, taken from Sense, you peradventure will judge to be but Natural
and Carnal, as those Terms are opposed to a true and Christian manner of
Reasoning: We defend the Contrary being warranted by the Argument which Christ
himself used to his Disciples, Luc. 24. 39. [Handle me, and see.] Your
Cardinal although he grant that this Reason of Christ was available, to prove
that his own Body was no Spirit, or Fancy, but a true body, even by the only
Argument from the Sense of Touching; Consequentie Christ^, affirmative sumpta,
Hoc pa patur, hoc videtur, Ergo est Corpus, optima fuit, quia sensus non
fallitur Circa proprium Obiectum: itaque necessario quod videtur, and tangitur
Corporale est. At negative; hoc non palpatur, nec videtur, Ergo non est Corpus;
Dominus non fecit, and mala est. Non falluntur Sensus nostri, cum nos album
quid, rotundum, solidum sentire arbitramur, quae sunt propria objecta. Sed cum
Panis Substantiam sub illis Accidentibus latere denuntiant, falluntur. Dominus
solum probare voluit se no^ esse inane spectrum, seu Phantasma, sed verum
Corpus; id quod ex Testimonio sensus Tangendi optime probavit. Illud autem
Corpus esse humanum, idem quod antea fuerat, non probavit Dominus hoc solo
Argumento, ex Tangendi sensu desumpto (quod sine dub^o non erat sufficiens) sed
multis alijs modis, loquendo, mandueando, testimonio Angelorum, miraculo
Piscium, allegatione Scripturarum. Bellar. (...). (...). de Euch. c. 14..
Respondeo.
Yet (says he) was it not sufficient in it self, without other Arguments to
confirm it, and to prove it to have been a humane body, and the very same
which it was. So he.

Which Answer of your Cardinal we wish were but only false, and not also
greatly irreligious: for Christ demonstrated hereby not only that he had a
body (as your Cardinal speaks) but also that it was his own same humane
body, now risen, which before had been Crucified, and wounded to Death, and
buried, according to that of Luke [That it is even I.] Luc. 24. 39. Now because
1. Cor 15.
It is not a Resurrection of a Body, except it be the Same body: Therefore
would Christ have Thomas to Ioh. 20. 27.
thrust his hands into his sides, and feel the print of his wounds, to
manifest the same body; as Two of your Jesuits do also observe, the One with
an Optime Origines, Ostendit se Christus in vero Corpore suo resuscitatum.
Tolet. Ies. in Ioh. c. 20. p. 534.
Optime, the Other with a Probatum est, Christum idem Corpus numero
demonstrasse. Suarez ^es. Tom. 2. qu. 54. 1.
Probatum est. Accordingly the Apostle Saint Paul laid this Argument, taken
from Sense, as the foundation of a Fundamental Article of Faith, even the
Resurrection of the same Body of Christ from the dead; for how often does he
repeat, and inculcate this? 1. Cor. 15. 5.
He was seen, etc. And again thrice more, He was seen, etc. And Saint John
argues, to the same purpose, from the Concurrence of three Senses: 1. Ioh. 1.
1.
That which we have heard, which we have seen, and our hands have handled,
declare we unto you. The validity of this Reason was proved by the Effect, as
Christ averreth, John 20. 29.
Thomas because thou have seen (that is, perceived both by Eye, and hand) thou
have believed.

The Validity of the Judgment of Sense, in THOMAS, and the other Disciples,
confirmed in the second place by your own Doctors.

SECT. VIII.
PErerius a Jesuit confidently pleads for the Sense of Touch: Illud sine
dubitatione dicere non verebor, non posse ab vllo Daemone formari corpus adeo
simile humano, ut siquis cum cura animi and attentione id tangeret, non facile
dignosceret ipsum non esse corpus humanum. Itaque non poterit Demon
similitudine corporis humani oculos fallere: Tactus autem sensum fallere
omnino, non potest, quod qua^^or Argumentis confirmabo -- Hoc ve^issimum esse
patet ex eo, quod Christus dixit discipulis s^is [Palpate and videte:] and
Thomae [Affer digitum, etc.] Perer. ^es. in Genesis 6. number. 78. p. 2.
I fear not (says he) to say, that the Evidence of Sense is so strong an
Argument, to prove without all doubt an humane Body, that the Devil himself
cannot herein delude the touch of man, that is of understanding and
consideration. As for the unbeleeving Disciples, [Christ his Handle me, etc.]
(says your Jesuit Si Discipuli Christi non potuissent Christi vera ossa and
carnes discernere, mollitiem, and duritie^ eorum, non dixisset ijs [Palpate,
and Videre] ac si diceret, Palpate, and Percipite veras carnes and ossa.
Vasquez. Ies. Tom. 2. qu. 51. Art. 2. disp. 184. cap 2. p. 487. Thomas dicit
fingula Argumenta non fuisse per se sufficientia, been tamen coniuncta probari

efficacissimum fuisse ad comprobandam ve^itatem Corporis humani in Christo.
Idem ibid.
Vasquez) was as much as if he had said to them, Perceive you my true flesh? as
being a most efficacious Argument to prove the truth of an humane Body. So he,
yea, and Illud Thomae [non credam, etc.] pertinaciae and obdurationis vitium
erat, and peccatum Infidelitatis. Optime Orig: lib. 2. con. Celsum, vbi docet
Discipulos affirmasse illum, quem viderunt, esse Christum in Corpore vero suo,

solum [Nisi videro, non credam] sed adiunxit, [Nisi infero manum in vestigia
Clavorum.] Tolet. Ies. Com. in Ioh. 20.
Tolet another Jesuit did well discern the case of Thomas to have been an
extreme Infidelity, when he said, [Except I put my finger into the print of
the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.] Which
proves the Efficaciousnesse of the Judgment of Sense, in reducing so extreme
an Unbeliever to believe.

Wherein your Authors are authorized by Saint Augustine, Aug. de tempore. Si
forte, inquit, Diceremus Thomae oculos fuisse deceptos, at non possemus dicere
manus frustratas* de Tactu non potest dubita^i. Et Greg. Pont. Plus nobis

saying, that Although Thomas his Eyes had been deceived, yet his touch was
not frustrate. And accordingly by Gregory Pope of Rome, who sticks not to say
that The Infidelity of Thomas made more for confirmation of Christian belief,
than did the faith of the other Apostles, because his Doubtfulnesse being
convinced by the Sense of Touching, we are thereby freed from all doubtfulnesse
in the faith. And if this were not sufficient to confute your Cardinal, he
may be shackled with his own answer, who, to disable the Infallibility of
the Sense of feeling, said; See above at (b.)
That other Arguments were requisite for the certifying the judgment of Sense:
and among these Other he reckons Christ his speaking, eating, and working
Miracles. All which, what are they else (we pray you) but equally Objects of
Sense? What Vertigo then may this be called in him, to seek to invalidate the
verity of Sense by an Argument, which justifies the certainty of Sense?

A third Confirmation of the Truth of Senses, as sufficient in Divine Causes,
for discerning Objects of Sense, and particularly in perceiving Bread and Wine
to continue the same in this Sacrament; by the judgment of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. IX.
HOw many Heretics of old were there (such as the Valentinians, Montanists,
Marcionites) who denied that Christ had a True, and Essential Body? and how
absolutely were they confuted of Ancient Fathers, by the Evidence of men's
Senses that heard, saw, and felt the Body of Christ? Which shows plainly that
a Demonstration by Sense stands good and strong even in Christian
Philosophy. And to come to the point in Question, to conclude from the
Premises in the former Section; who can deny this Consequence, viz. By the same
Evidence may a Christian man prove Bread to be truly Bread, after Consecration,
whereby Christ proved his Body to be a body of flesh, after his Resurrection?
But this he did from the Infallibility of Sense. Therefore this may be equally
concluded by the same Argument of Sense.

And that there is the same Reason of both these, the Ancient Father Theodoret
shows in the Argument, wherewith he confuted an Heretic by Sense, thus;
Eranistes apud Theod. Quia sicut Panis desinit esse Panis post Consecratione^,
sed mutatur in substantiam Corporis Christi. Ita Corpus Christi post
resurrectionem desinit esse proprie Corpus, sed in Naturam divinam mutatur.
Orthodox. Imo vero, ut te capiam in laqueis his: signa mystica non recedunt a
natura sua, manent enim in priori sua forma, figura, and substantia. Theod.
Dial. 2. Cap. 24.
As after Consecration (says he) Bread remains the same in substance: So
Christ his Body after the Resurrection remained in substance the same. Thus
much of the Analogy. (As for the word [Substance] more is to be spoken thereof
See hereafter, Sect. 12.
hereafter.) Yea, and Saint Augustine will not suffer the Communicant to
blindfold himself, whose Testimony (digested by Beda ex Augusti no, Sermon. ad
Infantes, in cap. 10. ad Cor. fol. 1^9. apud Bedam. Quod vidistis Panis est,
quod oculi vestri renunciant, quod autem fides vestra, etc. Sicut ex multis
granis tri^ici vnus Panis: Ita ex multitudine fidelium, vna as^urgit Ecclesia.
Bid) is this: That which you have seen is Bread, as your eyes do manifest
unto you. And he speaks of Bread, as this Sacrament was a Symbol, and Sign
of the mystical body of Christ, which is his Church, consisting of a multitude
of Faithful Communicants, as one Loaf does of many grains of wheat. So
Saint Augustine. Ergo, It is Bread after Consecration.

Tertullian has a large Plea against the Academici, who denied the judgment
of Sense; wherein he maintayneth the Truth of the Senses, and in proof
thereof he manifests the Perfection of Christ his Senses in Seeing, Feeling,
Tasting, Smelling; and at length he falls upon the point now in Question,
saying that Tertul. de Anima. cap. 7. ad finem. Quid agis, Academice
procacissime? totu^ vitae statum evertis, ipsius Dei providentiam excoecas --
non licet in dubium Sensus istos revocare, ne and in Christo de fide eorum
deliberetur, ne forte dicatur, quod falso Patris vocem audierit de ipso
testificatam, aut deceptus sit, cum Petri socrum tetigit: aut alium postea
vnguenti senserit spiritum, quod in sepulturam suam acceptavit: alium postea
Vini saporem, quod in sanguinis sui memoriam consecravit. Sic enim and Marcion
Phantasma ^um maluit credere, totius corporis in eo dedignatus veritatem: Atqui
ne in Apostolis quidem ludificata natura est, fidelis fuit and visus, and
auditus in Monte, fidelis and gustus Vini in nuptijs, fidelis tactus Thomae:
Recita testationem Iohannis; Quod audivimus, inquit, quod oculis vidimus, and
manus nost^ae contrectarunt de sermonevitae. Falsa vtique testatio, si ^culorum
and aurium, and manuum sensus natura mentitur.
If we yield not to the suffrages of Senses, some may doubt whether Christ
perceived afterward another Sent of ointment, which he received (meaning
another than the natural Sent thereof) before his Burial. And immediately he
adds, (mark we pray you) One might doubt also whether Christ tasted
afterward another taste of Wine, than was that, which he consecrated for the
memorial of his blood. That then, which Christ Tasted, was first Consecrated.
Next, he invadeth the Heretic Marcion, for denying the Truth of Christ's
Body on earth, and confuteth him by the fidelity of the Senses of the
Apostles. Faithful (says he) was their sight of Christ in the Mount,
Faithful was their Taste of Wine at the Marriage, Faithful was the Touch of
Thomas, etc. (then concluding:) which Testifications (says he) had not been
True, if their senses had been Liars. So he in his confutation not only of
the natural Academici, but also of the Heretical Marcionites, who (contrary
to the demonstration of the Apostles Senses) denied the truth of the humane
Body of Christ.

CHALLENGE.
THis Apology of Tertullian, in behalf of the verity of the Senses, does
minister to all Christians four Conclusions. First, not to conceit of
Accidents without Subjects: but to discern of Subjects, and Substances, by
their Accidents. Secondly, that our Outward Senses rightly constituted (more
especially the Sense of Feeling) are Demonstrations of Truth in Sensible
Objects. Thirdly, that this verification of Subjects, by their Accidents, is
common with Christ, his Apostles, all Christians, and with every reasonable
man. And lastly, that Wine is to be discerned to be truly and naturally Wine,
after Consecration, by the judgment of the Senses, because he instanceth in
this very point: teaching that Christ had the same taste of Wine afterward,
which he had before in that, which he consecrated; even as he had also the
same Sent of Ointment after, which he had before his Burial. And all this
even now, when he convinced Marcion of Heresy, an Enemy to the Catholic
Faith, in denying the Truth of Christ's humane natural Body, notwithstanding
the Evidence of Man's Senses.

Here had been a full and flat Evasion for that Heretic to say, what tell
you us of the validity of the Evidence of two Senses, concerning the Truth of
Christ's Body, seeing you your-selves gainsay the judgment of four Senses at
once, in denying the Existence of Bread in this Sacrament? This, we say, they
must needs have replied, if that the Catholics then had been of your now
Roman Belief, to think that all the Senses are deceived, in judging the
matter of this Sacrament to continue Bread or Wine; and so might they have
blown away all this Catholic Confutation of Heretics and Infidels with one
and the same breath.

Come now hither all ye that say we must renounce all Verdict of Senses in
this Case; and tell us whether any Protestant could have been more opposite to
your Doctrine than was Tertullian, in his Defense of this Truth? whereby he
also defends the Catholic Doctrine of the Resurrection of Christ, and was
never hereof questioned by any Catholic, in, or since his days.

Let none of you object that of the Disciples, in their way to Emmaus with
Christ, of whom it is said that [ Luc. 24. 16.
They could not know him:] for the same Text gives this Cause, that their eyes
were holden, lest they should see him: and after, Ib. verse. 31.
Their eyes were opened, and they saw him. So the Evangelist, which is so far
from infringing any thing that has been said, for the Infallibility of Sense,
rightly constituted and disposed, that this thereby is notably confirmed. We
call upon Hierome to witness, saying; Hieron. ad Pammach: contra Err^res
Johan. Ierusal. Episc. Scias errorem fuisse non Corporis Domini, sed oculorum
fuis^e clausorum: nam aperti sunt oculi eorum, and videbant.
The Error of not discerning Christ, when he was in the midst between them,
was not in Christ's Body, but in their eyes, because they were closed that they
could not see. Apply we this unto the Eucharist. Dare any Papist say, that the
Cause, why any of you cannot see Christ in this Sacrament, is not in his Body
(which you believe to be in it self invisible) but in your Eyes, as being shut
up; when notwithstanding you will be known, that these are open enough for
discerning Colors, and forms of Bread and Wine?

Our Fourth Proof, that the Substance of Bread remains, after Consecration,
is taken from the Confessed Sensible Effects.

your selves have discerned to be sometimes in this Sacrament, are these.
First, That the Cup does inebriate, or make drunk. Secondly, The Host taken
in great Quantity does nourish. Thirdly, That, it being poisoned, it poysoneth.
Fourthly, That having been long reserved, It engenders worms, which are bred
out of it; and are also fed of the same. Fifthly, That their matter of
Generation and nourishment is Substantial; and that the Contrary Opinion is
false, and Incredible. Sixthly, That this matter, whereof worms are bred and
fed, is the same Bread, which was taken before Consecration. So your own prime
Schoolmen, Historians, and Jesuits respectively.

If then the Bread, now ingendring worms, be the Same that was taken to be
Consecrated; How say you that being Consecrated it is not still the same, our
Senses giving Testimony thereunto?

THE FIRST CHALLENGE.
HEre you have nothing to answer, but that the Bread, whereof new worms are
Bred, whether it be the same that was, or not; yet being Bread, it is wrought
either by a Quomodo fiat haec materia. -- Thomistae aliquot dicunt per
Conversionem aliquam in ipsum Panem: Alij iterum Creari; and hoc verius.
Suarez. quo supra.
Miraculous Conversion, or by a New Creation. What? you, who every where teach
that none are to conceit of any Miracle in this Sacrament, without necessary
Cause, can you possibly be persuaded that there is, or can be any necessary
Cause, why God should work a Miracle, either of Conversion into, or of New
Creation of Bread, for Breeding, or Feeding of worms? or of Wine, for making
such men Drunk, as should taste too largely of the Cup? yea, or else to poison
our Enemy, were he See above at (n) number. 3.
Emperor, or Platina in vita Victoris. Henrici Regis fraud (ut Martinus
scribit) veneno in Calicem iniecto, dum sacrificat, necatur. See also above at
(n) number. 3.
Pope? Nay can it be less than Blasphemy to say that God works Miracles, for
the accomplishment of vain, wicked, and mischievous effects? But far be it
from us to imagine that the Blessed Body of our Lord Christ, who by his Touch
cured so many diseases, in the time of his mortality, should now, being
glorified, miraculously poison his Guests whosoever they be.

Believe (if you can) that if God wrought (as you say) a Miracle to convert
Accidents into Bread, to engender, or nourish vile worms, that he would not
much rather work a miracle, (if any such miracle were herein to be expected)
to hinder the poisoning of his faithful Communicants. In all this we appeal
again to true Antiquity, and require of you to show, we say not some express
Testimony of Primitive Fathers, but so much as any intimation or insinuation,
were it but by way of a Dream, of a Miraculous Conversion of the Consecrated
Host (when it begins to putrify) by being changed again into Bread; or of
Mice eating the Body of Christ, or that being putrified it should breed worms;
(seeing it were rather a miracle they should not be so bred) or any such kind
of Romish Fancies, and delusions; or otherwise to confess your Obiectours to
be miserable Proctours of a vile, and desperate Cause. Yet lest any of your may
think, that One coming into a Cellar full of new Wine, and made drunk with
the smell thereof, therefore mere Accidents do Inebriate: your Jesuit will
deny this, and tell you that it is the In Cella Vicaria, novis vinis impleta,
solus A^r odore infectus inebriat. Coster. Ies. Christian. Institut. lib. 1. c.
8.
Air infected with the odor which makes man Drunk.

A SECOND CHALLENGE, with a Caution.
YOur Common, and most plausible Objection, to dementate vulgar people, is to
persuade them that you cannot attribute Credit to your Senses in this case
without much derogation from Faith. Therefore, for Caution-sake, be it known
unto you, that we have not pleaded for the Truth of Senses, as holding nothing
Credible, but that, which may be proved by the Testimony of Senses.

This we utterly abhor, as the Gulf of Infidelity, proper to the Athean
Sect: for we accord to that saying of an holy Father, Fides non habet meritum,
vbi Ratio aut Sensus habet experimentum; and also to that other of (...).
Justin. E^posit. Fidei.
Iustine. In which respect we condemn the Incredulity of Thomas, in that he
would not believe, except he should See: yet notwithstanding we, with our
Savior, approve in Thomas, that by Seeing he did believe. For this is a true
Tenet in Divinity; Faith may be (Supra) above right reason, or sense; but never
(Contra) against either. It was never read that God required of any man a
belief of any Sensible thing, which was Contrary to the exact judgment of his
Senses. And therefore your opposition, in this Case, as it is Sensles, so it is
indeed Faithless; as we have already learned from Scripture and Fathers; by
whom the Judgment of Sense has been acknowledged to be, in Sensible Objects,
a notable Ground of Faith.

Our Fifth Proof, that Bread remains Bread in Substance, after Consecration,
in this Sacrament, is by the Judgment of Ancient Fathers. First from due
Inferences.

SECT. II.
TEstimonies of Ancient Fathers infer a necessary Consequence, for proof of
the Existence of Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, as might be proved partly by
the repetition of many Arguments premised, and partly by intimation of other
Arguments afterward expressed. But we shall be content with those few which
do more properly appertain to this present Dispute, concerning the nature of
a Body. First Irenaeus, speaking of the Eucharist after Consecration, as being
not now common Bread, said that Irenaeus lib. 4. cap. 34. Sicut Panis, qui est
a terra, iam non Communis Panis est, sed Eucharistia, ex duabus rebus constans
terrena, and caelesti: Sic Corpora nostra participantia Eucharistiam iam non
sunt Corruptibilia, sed spem Resurrectionis habentia.
It consists of an earthly part, and an heavenly: how? even as the Bodies of
the Communicants (says he) are no more corruptible, having an hope of the
Resurrection to come. Scan these words by the Law of Similitude, and it must
infallibly follow, that as our Bodies, albeit substantially Earthly, are
notwithstanding called Incorruptible, in respect of the Glory and Immortality,
in which (through hope) it has an Interest; Even so the Earthly Substance of
this Sacrament, being Bread, is nevertheless endued with a sacred and Divine
property of a Sacramental Representation of Christ's Body. Which Sacrament
Origin calling Sanctified meat, says that the Origin. in Math. 15. Ille
Cibus, qui sanctificatur per verbum Dei and Orationem, iuxta id quod habet
materiale in secessum emittitur. And after he calls this [Materiale] Materia
Panis, super quem dictus est Sermo. Ibid.
Material part thereof goes into the Draught, or seege: which no sanctified
heart can conceive of Christ's Body, whereof the Fathers often pronounce, that
It goes not into the Draught.

But what is meant by, Material, in this place, think you M. Liturg. Tract.
2.. 11. Subd. 3.
Breerly? namely, Magnitude, and other Sensible Accidents, which in regard of
their Significations, are materials. So he. Very learnedly answered forsooth!
If Magnitudo, that is Greatness, be a Material thing, be you so good as tell us
what is the matter thereof? for whatsoever is Material, has that appellation
from it is Subject matter. Is it the Body of Christ? then must you grant (which
we, with holy Fathers abhor to think) that the Body of Christ passes into
the Draught: or is it Bread? Then farewell Transubstantiation. Nay, will you
say, but they were Accidents; And we Answer, that it was never heard, no not in
your own Schools, that mere Accidents were called (which are Origen's words
in this place) either Meats, or Materials. Yea, and Origin (that he might
be known to understand Material Bread) furthermore calls it now, after
Consecration, Matter of Bread.

S. Ambrose his Comparison is of like Consequence; Ambros. l. 4. de Sacram.
cap. 4. Quanto magis est operatorius sermo Christi, ut sint quae erant, and in
aliud convertantur? -- Tu eras vetus Creatura, pos^quam Consecratus, nova
Creatura esse coepisti.
As one Baptized had been an old Creature, and was made a new one, even so
(speaking of the Bread and Wine after Consecration) they being changed into
another thing, remain that which they were before. But he (you know) that was
baptized remains after Baptism in Substance the same man, although, in
respect of Spiritual Graces, he suffers a Change. Of which Testimone more
See below, Chap. 4. Sect. 2. at the let (c.)
hereafter.

Cyprian is a Father much alleged and urged by you, in defense of
Transubstantiation; but is now at hand to control you. Cyprian. lib. de
Unction. Dedit Dominus noster in mensa, in qua ultimum Convivium cum Apostolis
participavir, proprijs manibus Panem and Vinum: in Cruce vero manibus militum
corpus tradidit vulnerandum, ut in Apostolis secretius impressa sincera veritas
and vera sinceritas exponeret Gentibus, quomodo Panis and Vinum Caro eius
essent and sanguis, and quibus rationibus Causae effectis convenirent, and
diversa nomina, vel species ad unam reducerentur essentiam, ut significantia
and significata eisdem vocabulis conserentur.
Our Lord gave in this Banquet (says he) Bread and Wine with his own hands,
when he pertaked thereof with his Apostles: but on the Cross he delivered up
his Body to the Soldiers to be pierced with wounds, to the end that sincere
verity, and true sincerity having an inward impression in the Apostles, he by
them might manifest to the Gentiles, how that Bread and wine is his Body and
Blood, and by what means there may be agreement between Causes, and Effects;
and how different names and forms might be reduced to one Essence; that things
signifying, and things signified might be called by the same names. So he. A
Catholic Father, as all know; whom if you ask, what Consecrated thing it
was, which Christ had in his hands, and gave to his Disciples, he answers it
was Bread, and Wine; and not absolutely that, which he gave up to be Crucified
on the Cross by Soldiers, (namely) his Body, and Blood. If again you demand
of Cyprian, why Christ called the Bread, which he had in his hand, his Body,
he readily answers saying: The things signifying (or Signs) are called by
the same names, whereby the things signified are termed.

Protestant of admirable learning unfolded unto you the Judgment of Antiquity,
from the Testimonies of diverse Fathers, in saying of this Sacrament, after
Consecration, that The bread, by being divided, is diminished: that, It is
delivered by fragments: that these are so little, that they are to be called
rather Bitts then Parts. Thus they spoke expressly of Bread Consecrated; but to
say that you eat bitts and Fragments of whitenes, of Roundnes, and other
Accidents, who is so absurd among your selves? And to affirm the same of
Christ's body, who is so impious? Somewhat more of this, when we shall appeal
to the Canon of that famous Council of Below in the fourth Book. Chapter 9.
Nice.

Another Inference we may take from Antiquity, in her calling this Sacrament
[Pignus] a Pledge (so Hieron. in 1. Cor. 11. Dominus passionis suae ultimam
nobis Commemorationem, and memoriam reliquit, quemad modum siquis peregre
proficiscens aliquod pignus ei, quem diligit, derelinquat, ut possit eius
amicitias, and benficia commemorate.
Hierome, and Gaudent Tract. 20. Christus crucifigendus istud haereditarium
munus Testamenti eius Novi, tanquam Pignus suae Praesentiae, dereliquit.
Gaudentius) of the Presence of Christ now departed from us. A Perfect Argument
of the Bodily Absence of Christ, by virtue of the Relation between the Person
and his Pledge. The third and last Classis of Fathers may be viewed in the
Section following.

A Confirmation of the same Judgment of the Fathers, acknowledging in express
terms Bread to remain after Consecration, in Substance, the same.

The First Father is THEODORET.

SECT. XII.
THeodoret makes a Dialogue, or Conference between two Parties, being in
Controversy about the humane and bodily nature of Christ; the one is named
Eramstes, upon whom is imposed the person of an Heretic, for Defense of the
Sect of the Eutychians, who (falsely) held, That the Body of Christ, after his
Ascension, being glorified, was swallowed up of his Deity, and continued no
more the same humane and Bodily Essence, as before his Resurrectiit had been.
The other Party and Disputer is named Orthodoxus, signifying the Defender of
the Truth of the Catholic Doctrine; which Person Theodoret himself did
sustain, in behalf of the Catholic Church. In this Dispute the Heretic is
brought in, for Defense of his Heresy, arguing thus; Even as Signs in the
Eucharist after the words of Invocation (or Consecration) are not the same, but
are changed into the Body of Christ: Even so, after his Ascension, was his Body
changed into a Divine [(...),] meaning, Substance of a Divine Essence. Which
both your Romanists and Protestants confess to have been the Doctrine of
these Heretics. This was that Heretic his Objection. The Orthodoxe, or
Catholic (which was Theodoret himself) comes to answer, promising to catch
the Heretic, as he says, in his own Snare, by retorting his Argument of
Similitude against him, thus: Th^^d. Dial. 2. c. 24. Non post sanctificatione^
mystica signa (...). Paulo post. Sic illud Corpus Christi priore^ habet Formam,
Figuram, Circumscriptionem, and (ut summatim dicam) (...)] etiamsi post
resurrectionem immortale, and immune ab omni corruptione.
Nay, But as the mystical Signs in the Eucharist, after Sanctification,
depart not from their former nature, but continue in their former Figure, Form
and [(...)] that is, Substance. So the Body of Christ, after the Resurrection,
remains in its former Figure, Form, Circumscription, and [(...), or
Substance] which it had before. You may perceive that the Assertion, set down
in the name of a grand Heretic, is absolutely your Romish Profession for
Transubstantiation at this day (to wit) Bread is changed after Consecration
into the Substance of Christ's Body; and that also the Assertion of Theodoret,
in the person of the Catholic Professor, being flat contradictory, is as
absolutely the Doctrine of Protestants, defending that Bread after Consecration
remains in Substance the same. Wherefore, if ever, it now concerns your
Disputers to free your Romish Article from Heresy:) which diverse have
undertaken to do by their Answers, but alas! so absurdly, that any reasonable
man must needs laugh at; and so false, as which any man of conscience must as
necessarily detest them.

The Principal Answer is that, which your Non loquitur de substantia quae
distinguitur contra Accidentia, and quam in Categorica posuit Aristoteles; sed
de Essentia, and natura Accidentium. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch c. 27.. Sed me.
Cardinal gives, that Theodoret, in saying that Bread remains the same in
Figure, Form, and [(...); By (...)] meant not Substance properly understood,
but the essence of Accidents. So he. An Answer (by your leave) notoriously,
ridiculously, and heretically False.

First, Notoriously false, because the Argument of Theodoret, being taken from
a Similitude, and every Similitude consisting of two Propositions, the first
called Protasis, and the other Apodosis, it is necessary by the Rule of Logique
(as you know) that the words and terms, betokening the same Similitude, be
used in the same signification in both Propositions. But in the Apodosis of
Theodoret, which is this: So the Body of Christ, after the Resurrection,
remains the same in Figure, Form, and (...); by the word [(...)] was meant
properly Substance, because this was (...), the maine point in Question
between Theodoret and the Heretic; viz. whether the Substance of Christ's
Body continued the same, which it had been in time before his Resurrection
(the Heretic denying it, and Theodoret proving it to be absolutely still the
same in Substance:) and not whether the same only in Quantities, and Accidents;
for these the Apostle teaches to be alterable, 1. Cor. 15. (...).
Corruption putting on Incorruption, Mortality Immortality, and shame Glory.
Therefore in the Protasis and first Proposition of that comparison of Theodoret
(which was this, As the Bread remains the same in Figure, Form and (...))
the word [(...)] can have no other signification than Substance, properly taken.

Secondly, Ridiculously false, because in reckoning Figure and Form, which are
known to be Accidents, and adding [(...)] this necessarily is opposed to the
former Two, as Substance to Accidents. Nor was there (we suppose) ever any so
unlearned, who did add the word [(...),] to Forms, and Figures, but he
thereby meant to distinguish it as a Substance from its Accidents.

Thirdly, Heretically false; for what was the Heresy of the E^tychians? tell
us; They (say Alphonsus a Castro de haeres. Eutych. Negabant Christum habuisse
naturam humanam; tantum i^ eo ponentes natural divinam.
you) held that Christ (namely after his Resurrection) had not an humane
nature, but only Divine. Which word Humane Nature does principally imply the
Substantial nature of Man; and therefore in his comparison, made for the
illustration of that Heresy concerning Bread, after Consecration, in Figure,
Form, and [(...)] the same word [(...)] had the same signification of
Substance, as your Master Brereley afterward is compelled to confess: who, to
the end he may disgrace Theodoret, rudely and wildly takes upon him to
justify the Heretics speech to be Catholic, for proof of
Transubstantiation.

Wherefore Theodoret, in his Answer Retorting (as he himself says) the
Heretics Comparison against him, did by (...) likewise understand Substance,
else had he not disputed ad Idem; but by a shameful Tergiversation had betrayed
his Catholic Cause unto that pernicious Heretic. Much like as if one should
use this comparison following. As the Moone-shine in the water (in the opinion
of the Vulgar) is truly of the same bigness with the Moon in the Firmament;
so a feigned friend is equally as loving as is a Faithful. And another
retorting the same should confute him, saying; Nay, but as the Moonshine in
the water is not of the same bigness with the Moon in the Firmament; even so
a feigned friend is not equally loving as is a Faithful. Here the word [Love]
being taken for Loyal Affection by the Objectour, if the sense thereof should
be perverted by the Answerer and Retorter, to signify lust, the Disputers
might be held to be little better than those Two in Alter hircu^ mulge^: alter
cribram supponit.
Agellius, where such an Obiectour is compared to a man milking an Hee-Goat,
(or if you will, a Bull) and the Answerer to another holding under a Sive.

Here had we fixed a Period, but that we again espied one Master Brerely (a
Romish Priest) coming against us with a full careere, who after that he had

confuted, for urging the former Objection, notwithstanding, concealing the
Answer, he blusheth not to regest the same; albeit, as one conscious to
himself of the futility thereof, he leaves it presently, falling foul upon
Theodoret, as though that Father had been in some distemper, when he so writ:
In his Liturgy of the Mass. Tract. 2.. 2 subd. 3 p. 254.
saying, first, that Theodoret used that his Retortion in his Not so, for he
was now not in a personal dispute, but deliberately writing against the
Heresy of the Eutychians.
heat of Dispute. Then he takes part with the Heretic, saying, It is not
likely that an Heretic should have urged against a Catholic sentence for
Transubstantiation, as for a point of Faith well known, if the same doctrine
had been then either unknown, or else condemned as False. So he, who might
as well have reasoned in the behalf of the Sadduces, condemned by Christ,
saying: It is not likely that they would so expressly have denied that there
are any Spirits, in their Dispute against Christ, if that Doctrine had been
then either unknown, or condemned as False by the Church of God among the
Jews. And yet it is certain that the Heresy of the Sadduces was judged
execrable in that Church. Now if the Eutychian Heretic find such Patronage
at the hands of your Priest, alas! what will become of the Father Theodoret?
Hearken, Theodoret being an Orthodoxe Bishop (says he) could not have
propounded the Heretics Argument, as grounded upon the Churches received
Doctrine of Transubstantiation, had the same been then unknown, and reputed
False. So he, who, if he had not lost his Logique, would certainly have argued
contrarily, saying; Theodoret, being an Orthodoxe and Catholic Bishop, would
never have set down an Objection for Transubstantiation in the name of a rank
Heretic, and after himself impugned and confuted the same, except he had
known it to be flatly repugnant to the Catholic Church in his time.
Wherefore if you be men of Faith, and not rather of Faction, let the miserable
perplexities of your Disputers, discovered both here, and throughout this whole
Treatise, move you to renounce them, as men of prostituted Consciences; and
their Cause, as forlorn of all Truth.

For a further Evidence, take unto you an Answer of your Jesuit Valen^ia to
this and the like Testimonies of Antiquity: It is not to be held any marvel
(says Valent. Ies. lib. 2. de Transub. c. 7. Dabimus aliud breve, and simplex,
and sine ullo incommodo responsum. Enimvero antequam quaestio ista de
Transubstantiatione palam in Ecclesia agitaretur, minime mirum est si unus, aut
alter, aut etiam aliqui minus considerate, and recte hac de resenserint, and
scripserint; maxim cum non tractarent ex instituto ipsam quaestione^.
he) why some Ancients have writ, and thought less considerately and truly,
before that Transubstantiation was handled publicly in the Church, especially
they not handling the same Question of purpose. So he; and this he calls a
brief and plain Answer. And so it is, whereby, in granting that
Transubstantiation had not been so Anciently handled in the Church, he
plainly confuteth your now Roman Church, which judges it to have been
always an Article of Faith: And affirming that the same Fathers Handled not
the point of purpose, it is as plainly confuted by Theodoret, who in this
Dispute did not argue against the Heretic in an extemporall speech
personally, but deliberately and punctually by writing, and therefore of
Purpose.

The Second Father, expressly defending the Existence of Bread in this
Sacrament, after Consecration, is Pope GELASIVS.

SECT. XIII.
THis Author have Protestants called Pope Gelasius, and urged his Testimony.
Your Disputers cavil; First at the name of the Author, calling Protestants
Non fuit hic Papa Gelasius, ut Adversarij impudenter iactant; sed Gelasius
Caesariensis Episcopus. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 27.
Impudent, for stiling him Pope Gelasius. But if he were not that Pope
Gelasius, what Gelasius might he be then? Gelasius Bishop of Caesarea, says
your Cardinal Bellarmine. Contrarily your Cardinal Baronius himself
contendeth that it was not that Pope Gelasius Anno 496. number. 123. etc. yet
coming to answer to the Sentence of Gelasius, does expound the doubtful
words thereof by the Phrases of Pope Gelasius ex Epist. ad Picenos, and
Dardan. Episc. number. 13, 14. which Epistles he before cited, as the true
Epistles of Pope Gelasius. Anno 493. number. 23. and Anno 494. number. 2. And after
Anno 496. number. 17. tells his Reader, saying: Vides, Lector, ex vsu verboru^

esse, etc. Et Anno 496. number. 13. Gelas. in Epist. ad Picen. ait, Peccato
Originali substantiam hominis esse depravatam, cum tamen eadem substantia
mansit, and Accidentia; utpote iustitia originalis, and alia dona erant
corrupta.
Baronius contendeth that he is a more ancient Gelasius, Anno 476. (namely)
Gelasius Citizenus; yet so, as confounding himself, insomuch that he is
forced to expound the speeches of this Gelasius by the propriety of the speech
(as he confesses) of Gelasius Pope of Rome. But what shall we answer for the
Impudent Protestants, as your Cardinal has called them? Surely nothing, but
we require more modesty in him, who has so called them; considering that
Protestants had no fewer Guides, nor meaner to follow than these Gelasius Papa

Historians, viz. Genadius, yea your Bibliothecarie Anastasius, Alphonsus de
Castro, Onuphrius, Massonius, Margarinus la Bigne: all which have entitled
this Gelasius Pope of Rome. Howsoever, it is confessed on all sides, that he
was an Orthodoxe Father, and very Ancient.

Now then, Gelasius said that Gelasius lib. de duab. nature. cont. Eutych.
Sacramenta certa, quae sumimus corporis and sanguinis Christi divina res est,
propter quod per eadem divinae efficimur participes naturae, and tamen non
desinit esse substantia vel natura panis, and vini; and certe imago and
similitudo corporis and sanguinis Christi in Action mystica celebratur. And
again. Permanentin proprietate naturae.
The Sacraments of the Body, and Blood of Christ, being Divine things, yet
cease not to be the nature and substance of Bread, and Wine. In Answer
whereunto, both your foresaid Bellar. and Baron. quo supra. At dicit Gelasius,
In Divinam t^anseunt Spiritu sancto perficiente substantiam, permanent tamen
sua proprietate naturae. [By this it may be seen, indeed, that this Gelasius
was a Latin Author, (but what is this to the Greek Theodoret?) when the
Latin Language was not so perfect, and that he did use the word equivocally,
but yet so, that the matter it self does challenge a proper use thereof, when
he speaks of the Substance of Bread.]
Cardinals here, (as before) by Substance interpret Accidents: one of them
laboring to prove that Gelasius somewhere else called Accidents, Substances.
Were this granted, yet the Argument, which Gelasius has in hand, will compel
the understanding Reader to acknowledge in this his Sentence a proper
signification of Substance. For whereas the Heretic Eutyches taught that
Christ his Body was changed into the Substance of his Divinity, after the
Resurrection, and that the substance of his Body remained no more the same;
Gelasius confuteth him by a Similitude, and Comparison, viz. That as the
Substance of Bread remains after Consecration: So Christ his Bodily Substance
remained after the Resurrection. Wherein if the word, Substance, be not in both
places taken properly, Gelasius should have made but a mad Reason, as any
reasonable man will confess. For albeit Similitudes do not amble always on
four feet, yet if they halt upon the right foot (which is the matter in
Question) they are to be accounted perfect Dissimilitudes.

Master Master Brereley Liturg. Tract. 2.. 2. Subd. 3. p. 259.
Brereley would have you to know, that this Gelasius (whosoever he were)
writes against the same Eutychian Heresy, that Theodoret did; and thereupon
uses accordingly, to his like advantage, the words Substance, and Nature in
the same sense, as did Theodoret. So he. And he says true; and therefore must
we assure our selves of the consent of this Gelasius with us, until you shall
be able to free your selves from our former Interpretation of Theodoret. But
Mr. Brerely opposes against us another sentence of Gelasius, from whence he
concludes that Gelasius held Transubstantiation: so that Gelasius must rather
contradict himself, then that he shall not consent to the Romish Tenet. Whereas,
indeed, he says no more than, in a mystical sense, any Protestant must, and
will allow, viz. that The Sacrament is a Divine thing, and that whosoever eat
spiritually the Body of Christ, are by it made partakers of the blessing of his
Divine Nature, which dwells in Christ bodily, says the Apostle. So Gelasius.

To which saying of Gelasius, touching the Eucharist, is answerable a like
saying of Gregory Nyssen, concerning Baptism, calling it a Greg. Nyssen. Aquam
per benedictionem sic mutari, ut divinum Lavacru^ sit, a quo mirabiles existunt
effectus. Orat. de Baptismo.
Divine Laver, working miraculous effects. Yea, and Dionysius the Dionys.
Hierarch. Eccles. cap. 3. (...).. (...).
Areopagite bestowed the same Attribute, viz. Divine, upon the Altar, the
Symbols, the Priest, the People, and the Bread it self in the Eucharist. If
therefore the Epithet [Divine] must argue a Corporal Change, what a number of
Transubstantiations must you be enforced to allow? Fie upon blind boldness!
This man's falsity, in alleging Chemnitius, I let pass.

It is further worthy your Reflection, to observe your Disputers how earnest
they have bin to prove that this Author was not Pope Gelasius; contrary to the
acknowledgement of your own Historians. May we not therefore suspect that the
Testimony objected was distasteful unto them, when they so greatly feared, lest
this Witness should be thought to have been a Pope and Supreme Paster of
your Church?

Two other Testimonies from Antiquity, for the express acknowledgement of the
Existence of Bread after Consecration, in the Sacrament; Chrysostom, and
Bertram.

SECT. XIIII.
Chrysostom his words are these, that Chrysostom. Ante Consecrationem Panem
vocamus, Divina vero gratia Sacerdotis ministerio sanctificatur, and digna
appellatione Dominici Corporis habetur, etsi natura Panis in ipso permansit.
Epist. ad Caesar.
Bread after Consecration is freed from the name of Bread, being accounted
worthy of the name of the Body of Christ, albeit the nature of it remains
therein still. Your Exception is, that this Epistle is not extant among the
works of Chrysostom. This Answer might satisfy us, were it not that it was
extant sometime in the Libraries of So our Peter Martyr.
Florence, and So your Stephen Gardener, Bishop of Winchester, lib 2. de Euch.
as he is cited.
Canterbury. To whom may be adjoined the Author of that Imperfect work, still
standing under the name of Chrysostom, and by you upon any occasion objected
against us; wherein it is expressly said, that Author operis imperfecti, in
Math. hom. 11. Si ergo haec vasa sanctificata ad priuatos usus transfer sit
periculosum, in quibus non est Corpus Christi, sed mysterium Corporis eius
continetur; quanto magis vasa Corporis nostri, quae sibi Deus ad habitandum
praeparavit?
The True Body of Christ is not contained within these sanctified Vessels. It
seems that your later Parisian Divines were offended with others, who would
have these words utterly dashed out of their last Editions, which were
published in the former; as you have been admonished by one Dr. James in his
Specimen corruptelarum, etc. Haec verba habentur in editione Antwerpiana. Anno
1537. apud Ioh. Steelsium, and in Parisiensi An. 1543. apud Ioh. Roydwey, ut in
Parisiensi alia apud Andraeam Parvum, Anno 1557.

Bertram is our next witness from Antiquity, being about 800. years ago, and
never noted of Error anciently, until these later times of Booke-butchery

he does in his Bertramus. Secundum Creaturarum substantiam, quod fuerant ante

CHAP. IV.
Answers to the Objections of Romish Doctors, taken from the Testimonies of
Ancient Fathers, for Transubstantiation.

Or, an Antidote to expel all their poysonsome Pretenses in that behalf.

SECT. I.
THis our Antidote is compounded of five Ingredients, used for the Discovery of
the Vnconscionablenes of your Disputers, in their Obiecting the Testimonies of
Fathers under False pretenses. First, upon their terming the mystical Act A
Work of Omnipotency. Secondly, their denying of the Eucharist to be Naked,
and Bare Bread. Thirdly, in forbidding the Communicants to rely upon the
Judgment of their Senses. Fourthly, in their mentioning the Change of Bread
and Wine, in this Sacrament, and calling it Transmutation, Transition, and the
like. Fifthly and lastly in forcing of the speeches of Fathers, which may seem
to make for Transubstantiation, as absolutely spoken of the Sacrament of the
Eucharist, which the same Fathers do apply as well to the Sacrament of
Baptism, and also to other sacred Rites, wherein you believe there is not any
Substantial Change at all.

The First Vnconscionablenes of your Romish Disputers, in obiecting the Fathers
speeches of^an Omnipotent Work in this Sacrament, for proof of
Transubstantiation.

SECT. II.
A Work of Omnipotency is attributed by diverse Fathers to the Change, which
is made in this Sacrament, which we likewise* confess. Ambros. Se^ino
Christi, qui potuit ex nihilo facere quod non erat, non potest ea quae sunt in
id mutate, quod non erant etc. De myster. initiand. c. 9 -- At omnipotentia non
requiritur, ad faciendum ut res aliquid significet. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de
Euch. c. 14. Ambrosius ostendit multis miraculis in Eucharistia no^ esse id
quod natura formavit, sed quod Benedictio co^. secravit. Idem. Ibid. c. 24..
Posterior. and Aug. lib. 3. de Tr^tate, cap. 4.
Ambrose compares the Change by Benediction, made in this Sacrament, unto many
miraculous works of God; yea, even to the work of Creation. Ex Cyprian de
Coena Domini.. Secundum. -- Panis iste non effigy, sed natura mutatus
omporentia verbi factus est Caro. Et sicut in persona Christi humanitas
apparebat, and latebat Divinitas* ita Sacramento visibili divina se effundit
essentia. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 9. [whereas Natura mutatus
signifies not the Substance, but the Condition: Et factus Caro, is no more
than a Sacramental and mystical Being of the Body of Christ, as all other
places of Cyprian show.]
Cyprian speaks of a Change in nature, by divine Omnipotency. Aug. de
Trinitate, lib. 3. Non sanctificat ut sit magnum Sacramentum, nisi operante
spiritu Dei, quae per illos cum haec omnia Corporales motus sint, Deus
operatur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 24.. Sed Paulo.
Augustine reckoning it among God's miracles, says that This Sacrament is
wrought by the Spirit of God. Accordingly we hear Chrysostom. hom. 83. Non sunt
humanae virtutis haec opera, quae tune in illa Coena confecit, ipse nunc quoque
operatur, ipse perficit, ministrorum nos ordinem tenemus: qui vera haec
sanctificat atque transmutat ipse est. This is objected by Mr. Breerly, Tract.
2.. 2. Subd. 2. page 111 Liturg.
Chrysostom proclaiming, that These are not works of humane power: He that
changes, and transmuteth now is the same that he was in his last Supper. Each
one of these Testimonies are principally alleged by your Disputers, as the
strongest fortresses for defense of your Article of Transubstantiation; and
being taken altogether they are esteemed as a Bulwark impregnable; but why?
See above in his obiecting of Ambrose.
Because (says your Cardinal) Omnipotency is not required to make a thing to
be a Sign Significant. Se he. We answer first from your own Confessions, and
then from the Fathers themselves.

There are two works observable in every Sacrament: one is to be not only a
Sign of an Invisible grace, promised by God: but also both a Seal and Pledge
thereof, as all Protestants hold; and (as your most opposed Calvin. Semper
memoria repetendum est Sacramenta nihil quam Instrumentales esse conferendae
nobis gratiae Causas. Antid. in Conc. Trid. Sess. 7. Can. 5.
Calvin teaches) an Isntrumental cause of conferring grace to the partakers
of the Sacraments. In both which Respects there is required an Omnipotency of
a Divine work, without which the Element cannot be changed into a Sacrament,
either to signify, or yet to seal, much less to convey any Grace of God unto
man. And (that we may take you along with us)* It is the Doctrine of your
Church, with common consent (says your Roman Solus Deus (communi Consensu)
instituere Sacramenta ex authoritate potest, quae gratiam efficient, aut etiam
infallibiliter significant. Bellar. lib 1. de Sacram in genesis cap. 23.
Cardinal) that God only can by his Authority institute a Sacrament, because
he only can give them power of conferring grace, and of infallible
signification thereof. So he. Well then, as well infallible Signification of
Grace, as the efficacious conveyance of Grace is the work of the same
Omnipotency. To this purpose more plainly your English Cardinal Alan,
speaking (as he says) from the judgment of Divines, Card. Alan. de Sacram. in
Genesis c. 17. (...) 18. Sacramenti Institutionem neque ad Pontificem, neque ad
ullam Creatura^ pertinere: nec hoc solum sed etiam, etc. -- propter solam
significationem Gratiae, quain Sacramentis omnibus Communem diximus, debebant
eriam vetera Sacramenta determinari per appplicationem n^ortis Christi: quia
licet quidem in Creaturis, ad signationem effectuum spiritualium, aptitudo
quaedam sit, t^men ista aptitudo non nisi a divinainstitutione determinatur ad
peculiarem effectum. Habet enim Aqua ex natura sua ut munditiem significet, at
ut determinate purgationem animae a peccato originali significet, and hominis
sanctificationem repraesentet; divinaetantum institutionis est, per quam
elevatur Creatura haec supra naturae consu^tudinem, non solum quoad vim
operandi, sed etiam significandi. Non potest Sacramentum nisi a solo Deo
Ordinari, quia habent Sacramenta Supernaturalem Effectum, ut in veterilege,
quae dabant munditiem legalem. These (he says) that he speaks, Ex
Theologorum Sententia.
tells you that Although there be an apt nes in every Creature to bear a
signification of some spiritall effect, yet cannot the aptnes be determinately
applied unto any peculiar effect, n^ not so much as to signify the outward
Cleannes of man's Body (Sacramentally) without a Divine Institution: much less
to represent man's sanctification, but being so determinated and ordained of
God, the Creature (says he) is elevated above the Custom of nature, not
only in respect of the work of sanctification, but even of signification
also. So he; And that as well as we could wish: for this Omnipotent Change of
a Creature into a Sacrament, and this Isntrumental Cause of conferring
Sanctifying Grace, to the Faithful Communicant, is the General Doctrine of
all Protestants. But what Change shall we think? Of the Substance of Bread
into the Substance of Christ's Body, as you teach? No; but as Book 2. Chap. 2.
7.
before Isidore said, The Change of visible things, by the spirit of God, into
a Sacrament of Christ's Body.

Seeing then that both Divine power, and authority is required in every
Sacrament, to make it either infallibly significant, or else efficaciously
profitable to man; and that it is by the same Divine power that the Element is
Changed, by being Elevated from a common, unto a spiritual and divine property
of a Sacramental Signification, as one of your Cardinals has said: What an
unconscionablenes is it then in your Disputers, from the terms of Omnipotency
and Divine working, which is necessary in all Sacraments, to conclude a Change
of the Element of Bread, by Transubstantiation, as you have heard.

But much more transparent will their Inconsionableness be, if we consult
with the Objected Fathers themselves. For first Ambrose, who observes an
Omnipotency in the Change of this Sacrament, explaineth himself what kind of
Efficacy he meant, viz. such that Ambros. lib. 4. de Sacram c. 4. Si tanta vis
est in sermon Domini, ut incipiant esse quae non erant, quanto magis
Operatorius est, ut sint quae erant, and in aliud conuertantur (...) -- Tu ipse
eras vetushomo, postquam consecratus eras, novus homo esse coepisti.
The things changed into a divine Sacrament are still the same which they were
before (namely) according to their natural property. Which one Clause does so
strangle all conceit of Transubstantiation, that it may seem you have some
reason to wipe this Testimony of Saint Ambrose out of your new These words are
wanting in the Roman and Paris Editions Anno 1603. As Bishop Usher witnesses
in his Answer to the Jesuit.
Editions: notwithstanding, by Gods providence, so much of Ambrose his tongue
is preserved even in the same place, as will convince your Obiectors of wilful
Falsehood, telling you by a Similitude that the Change of Bread in this
Sacrament is like to the Change whereby a Christian Regenerate See above at (i.)
of an old Creature is made a new Creature: which is (as every Christian
knows) not a change in the substantial nature of man, but in the Accidental
properties. So this Bread of of a common bodily Food is made Sacramental. And
the same Father who said of a man, that by Baptism he is made a new Creature,
says also of this Sacrament, that Per Benedictione^ natura ipsa mutatur.
Ambros. De ijs qui mysterijs initiantur. where C. 9. ^e adds, for
Explication; Corpus significatur.
By Benediction Bread is made another nature, (namely) of an Elementall become
Sacramental, as you have heard; and as his own words import, After
Consecration the Body of Christ is signified: and that, which was Wine, Is
called Blood.

In the Testimony of Cyprian you applaude your selves, for to your Lindan
Lindan. Aurea prors^ sunt Divi Cypriani verba -- h^c mihi advigilate,
Evangelici, and Divum Cyprianum orbis totius Doctorem, imo miraculum, iudicem
incorruptibilem audite. lib. 4 cap. 6.
The words of Cyprian appear Golden: and he must needs provoke, forsooth,
all Gospellers to hearken unto them: which also seems to your Hoc Testimonium
nullam admittit Solutionem. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 9.. Secundum.
Cardinal To admit no solution. Our Answer first unto the Author is to deny
it to be the Testimony of Cyprian: may we not? This Sermon of the Supper of the
Lord is by us (says your Master Master Brerely Liturg. Praef. 14 page 51.
Brerely) attributed to Cyprian. Whom of your Side he meant by [Vs] you may be
pleased to ask him; sure we are your Cardinal does tell us that Author illius
de Coena Domini non est Cyprianus, sed aliquis post eum. Bellar. lib. 2. de
Euch. c. 9.. Extet.
The Author of this Book is not Cyprian, but some other after him. But, not
to disclaim your Author; all that he says is that Cyprian. de Coenae Dom.
Panis iste natura mutatus omnipotentia verbi factus est Caro, etc.
Bread is changed by God's Omnipotency not in Figure, but in Nature. This is
all; And all this has been, but even now, quitted by your own Confessions,
granting a power of Omnipotency in every Sacramental Change, where the
natural Element is altered from it is common habitude into the nature of a
Spiritual Instrument and use, both signifying and exhibiting Divine Grace: and
so the word Nature does import. The Schools, distinguishing the Nature of
Accidents from the Nature of Subjects, show that there is an Accidental Nature
as well as a Substantial. Theology teaching that Ephesians. 2. 3. August. Ipsam
naturam aliter dicens: cum proptieloquimur naturam hominis inculpabilis factus
est.
By nature we are the children of wrath; wherein Nature signifies only a
vicious Quality. This saying, viz. Indifferent things in fact Change their
nature, when they are commanded, Master Liturg. Tract. 4.. 6.
Brerely allows of, as for example: a Surplesse being commanded by lawful
Authority, the use thereof becomes necessary, so that the nature thereof is
Changed, yet not in the Substance of the thing, but in the legal necessity of
the use.

But to come nearer, Answer us but this one Question. Whereas all learning
allows this saying, that in Baptism the nature of the Element, and the
nature of the Sacrament are different, whereupon it is said; The word coming
to the Element makes it a Sacrament: when we shall say of the water in
Baptism, that the Nature of it, as of a Sacrament, is more excellent than is
the nature of it, as it is a mere Element, whether does not the word, Nature,
attributed to the Sacrament, justly accord unto the Phrase of Cyprian, in the
case of the Eucharist? and so much the rather, because that Cyprian, in the
words of immediately following the Testimony objected, does fully confute
Transubstantiation by a Similitude, comparing the Humanity, and Deity of Christ
with the Natural and Spiritual parts of this Sacrament, to wit; Et sicut in
person^ Christi humanitas videbatur, and latebat Divinitas; ita Sacramento
visibili ineffabiliter divina se effundit essentia. Author C^n^. Ibid.. Quarto.
As in Christ himself true humanity appeared in his flesh, and his Deity was
hid: (This was the (...), and first part of this Similitude; the (...), and
next part follows) Even so in this visible Sacrament the Divine Essence
infuseth it self. So he, which, by the law of a Similitude, must stand thus:
Even so Bread in this Sacrament is seen, and the Spiritual operation of God's
power therein to the Faithful is Invisible. Like as we may say of the
preaching of the Word of God to the Faithful; The words are audible, and
sensible, but because of the inward working of God's Spirit, for the Conversion
of Man's soul, it is called Romans 1. 16.
The Power of God unto salvation: as likewise Baptism is made the Lavacre of
Regeneration; whereof Greg. Nyssen affirms that Greg. Nyssen. Orat. de
Baptismo. Divinum Lavacrum magnum quid operatur per Benedictionem, and
mirabiles producit Effectus.
It works marvellously by benediction, and produces mavelous Effects. As
for Augustine, and Chrysostom (not to be superfluous) every Protestant does
both believe and profess, namely, a Divine Operation of God, both by changing
the Element into a Sacrament, and working by that Sacrament Spiritual Effects,
to the good of Man's soul.

The second Inconsionableness of Romish Disputers, in abuse of the
Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, is seen in objecting their denial of Common
and Bare Bread in this Sacrament, for an Argument of Transubstantiation.

SECT. III.
TO this purpose Irenaeus, saying that Irenaeus lib. 4. contra Her. c. 34. Non
est Panis Co^munis. Bellar. Obijcit l. 2. de Euch. per totum.
It is not Common Bread: Ergo (say you) not to be properly judged by Sense.
Unconscionably, knowing that Sol. Chrysostom. in Ps. 22. hom. 16. De aqua
Baptismi. Non est aqua Communis.
Chrysostom (and also all other Fathers whom you moreover object) says
likewise of the Sacrament of Baptism, See in this Sect. lit. ((...). h)
We are to behold it not as common water. The second i^ Iustine Martyr,
saying; Bellar. Ob. Justin. Mart. l. 2. Apol. (...), etc. Sol. Ratio. quia
(...), id est, Eucharisticatus, sive sanctificatus Cibus.
We receive these not as Common Bread, or Common Drink. Therefore (say you) we
may not judge them by Sense. Unconscionably; knowing that Iustine Martyr in the
same place shows his Reason, why it is not to be called Common, even because
(says he) it is [(...)] that is, Sanctified meat. And so Water in Baptism is
Sanctified, as you know. The third is Cyril of Jerusalem, saying, Bellar. lib.
2. de Euch. c. 1^. Ob. Cyril. Hieros. Catech. 18. (...). Sol. Idem Catech. 18.
(...).
Consider these, not as Common Bread and Wine: Ergo (say you) not to be judged
by Sense. Unconscionably, knowing that the same Cyril, in the same place, says
the same of the water of Baptism: It is not simple Water. Yea, but he further
says (say Ob Cyri^^. mystag. 3. (...).
you) Think not of it, as of bare Bread (adding) but the body of Christ. Ergo
(say you) not to be judged otherwise by Sense. Unconscionably; knowing that the
same Father in the same place, for explanation sake, says likewise of Sol.
Sequitur: (...). Idem Cat^. Mystag. 3.
Sacred Oil, viz. Even so that holy Oil is not bare and simple Oil (Adding)
but the gift of Grace.

And that your Authors Inconsionableness may be the more notorious, in their
wresting of the Catholic meaning of the Fathers, in this kind, we must tell
you that there is no speech more familiar unto ancient Fathers than to esteem,
as they ought, all Sacramental Signs Sacred; and therefore no more Common, or
bare Elements. Insomuch that Gregory Nyssen, speaking of a Ceremony inferior
to this Sacrament, which is the Altar, or Table of the Lord, he says that
Greg. Nyssen. Altar hoc sanctum, cui adfistimus, lapis est natura Communis,
nihil differe^s ab alijs crustis lapideis, ex quibus pavimeta nostra
exornantur: Sed quoniam Dei cultui consecratur, and dedicatur, and
benedictionem accepit, mensa facta, and Altar immacula^um est. Orat. de Sancto
Baptism. Et ne contemnas divinum Lavacrum, neque id Commune putes, etc.
Although by nature it be but as other stone, wherewith the Pavements are
garnished, and adorned; yet being Consecrated to God's Service, by Benediction,
it is an holy Table and Altar. Yea, and what less does your Church say of your
hallowed Balsome, Beads, and Bells, and the like, all which you distinguish from
Common, and bare Oils, and Metalls, because of their different use; and
service, without Opinion of any Change of Substance at all?

The third Inconsionableness of your Disputers in urging, for proof of
Transubstantiation, the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, forbidding men to
[Discerne of this Sacrament by their Senses.]

And first of their abusing the Testimony of Cyril, by two egregious
Falsifications.

SECT. IV.
WE may not easily pass over your Objection taken out of Cyril, being in the
opinion of your Cardinal so impregnable; Let us first hear your Obiector.
Cyrilli Testimonium vel solum sufficere deberet, est n. huius Sancti, and
antiquissimi, and ex opere eius indubitato, and clarissimum and apertissimum,
ut nullo modo perverti possit; and est in Catechesi, in qua sole^t omnia
proprie and simpliciter explicari, and denique nemo unqua^ reprehendit Cyrillum
erroris alicuius circa Eucharistiam. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 13.
This Testimony of Cyril alone ought to suffice, being the Sentence of an holy
man, and most ancient, out of a work which (unquestionably) was his, yea and
most clear, and plain, as that it cannot be perverted: Besides it is in his
Catechism, wherein the use of all things is delivered simply, properly, and
plainly: Nor was this Father Cyril ever reproved of Error in his doctrine of
the Eucharist. Thus far your Cardinal, you see, with as accurate an oratory
of Amplification, as could be invented. What Protestant would not now, if ever,
expect a deadly blow from this Father to our Catholic Cause? but attend to
the Issue.

First, Cyril. Pro certissimo habeas Pane^ hunc, qui videtur a nobis, Panem non
esse, etiamsi gustus Panem esse senserit, sed esse Corpus Christi -- Rursus.
Christus cui credamus, Panem in Corpus Transmutavi^ -- Nam sub specie Panis
datur tibi corpus: sub specie Vini datur tibi sanguis. Catech. Mystag. 4.
Cyril will not allow a man to credit his Taste, but although Taste says it is
Bread, yet undoubtedly to believe it to be the Body of Christ, whereinto the
Bread is changed. And he is brought in by your Cyrillus aperte ponit
Transmutationem Panis in corpus Christi, and solas species Panis remanere post
Transmutationem, quia dicit Corpus Domini sub spec^e Panis sumi, distinguens
Corpusd Pane. Bellar l^ de Euch. cap. 13. adding; Hoc est Apertissimum
Argumentum.
Cardinal to aver furthermore that The Body of Christ is given under the
form of Bread. And so the Sentence seems to be most manifest, says he. But
for what we pray you? That first (forsooth) the Change is the same with
Transubstantiation: and secondly that there is no more Substance of Bread, but
Accidents under the form of Bread. So he, and Master Liturg. Tract. 2.. 2.
Sub'd. 4. page 116.
Brerely from him, as follows; Cyril says, under the form of Bread his Body
is given, etc. and then dancing in the same triumph, adds; Can any Catholic
of this Age write more plainly? So he. And we answer, could any Iugglers deal
more falsely? For upon due examination it will appear to be a manifest
Delusion, by a false Translation of Cyril's words. The Body of Christ is given
(as your Cardinal does render it) sub specie Panis, under the form of Bread;
whereas it is in the Greek, Cyril. (...). Catech. Mystag. 4. Rursus. Mystag.
5. Non existimetis vos gustare Panem, and Vinum, (...).
Under the Type of Bread: even as he says afterward; Think not that you
taste Bread, but the Antitype of Christ's Body. In both, [(...), or (...)] not,
[(...):] Type, and Antitype, not Form, or Figure of Bread.

Now there is a maine and manifest difference between Form, and Type. For
Accidental Forms are things Real, and the determinate Objects of Sense; but
Types, or Antitypes are only Relatives, and (as such) no Objects of Sense, but
of Reason, and understanding only. As for Example, when a Judge is set in his
Scarlet upon the Bench, the Eye sees nothing but red Scarlet, and the fashion
of the Gown, and outward figurature of his Face, and so may every Child see
him; for these are Outward and Visible Accidents. But to see that man, as he
has upon him the person of a Judge, ordained to try Causes between parties,
is a sight of the mind, which looks upon his Office, to discern him by his
Habit from common Subjects. Even so is it in this Sacrament; As the Bread and
Wine are Round, and White, and Sweet in Taste, our Bodily Senses perceive them;
but as they are Types, and Antitypes, that is, Signs of the Body and Blood of
Christ, so are they spiritually discerned with our understanding only.

As therefore it follows not, that the Scarlet Gown of the Judge, because it
is an Ensign of his Office, should be only Color and Fashion, without the
matter and Substance of the Cloth; no more can any conclude from Cyrill, that
because the Sacrament is a Type, therefore this Type was only Form, and
outward Accidents, without all Substance of Bread. And thus your Cardinal his
first [Apertissimum Argumentum] for proof of Accidents, without the Substance
of Bread in this Sacrament, is proved to be Apertissimum Figmentum, void of all
substance, or almost shadow of Truth.

His next observation is the Change by Transubstantiation, and the error of
Sense, in judging it to be Bread. We call upon Cyrill to decide this
Controversy, who is best able to interpret himself. He therefore that said
of the Eucharist, after Consecration, It is not Bare Bread, but the Body of
Christ, affirmed as much of Consecrated Oil, saying, It is (...) Bare Oil.
But we are answered, that Bellar. Hoc confirmat sententiam nostram. Nam
Cyrillus non eodem modo loquitur de Chrismate, and de Eucharistia. De hac enim
ait, Non esse Panem Communem, sed Corpus Christi: de Chrismate vero dicitur
quidem, non esse Commune Vnguentum, sed non addit Spiritum sanctum, vel Corpus
Christi: sed esse Chrisma Christi sanctificatum oleum. Lib. 2. de Euch. C. 13.
Cyrill, in denying the Eucharist to be Common Bread, called it after
Consecration Christ's Body: but in denying Oil to be Bare Oil, he called it
yet still Chrisme (that is) Sanctified Oil, after Consecration. So your
Cardinal. And so are we posed for ever. But behold another Jesuitical Fraud!
For Cyrill as he called the Consecrated Bread Christ's Body, after
Consecration, so does he call the Consecrated Oil [Charisma] that is, the Gift
of the Grace of Christ; and not [Chrisma] that is, Chrisme, or Ointment, as
your Cardinal renders it.

We say again he calls that Charisma, which notwithstanding he says was,
after Consecration, still Oil, wherewith their Foreheads were anointed. This
must we judge to have been a notable Falsification of Bellarmine, except you
would rather we should think, that when he was now to prove that our Senses
are deceived, in judging of Bread to be Bread, he meant to prove it by seeming
to be deceived himself, in thus mistaking the word Chrisma, for (...). Cyril.
Catc^^. Mystag. 3.
Charisma, and so utterly perverting the Judgment of Cyrill; by whom we are
contrarily taught, that the Sight is no more deceived in judging Bread to be
Bread, than in discerning Oil to be Oil. For neither was the other Bare Oil,
being a Type of a spiritual Gift; nor yet was it therefore changed into the
Spiritual Grace it self, because it is so called; but only is a Type and
Symbol thereof. Which One Parallel of Oil with Bread does discover the
Unconscionable pertinacie and Perverseness of your Disputers, in urging the
Testimony of Cyrill.

The like Romish Objection out of Chrysostom, and as Unconscionable.

SECT. V.
SAint Chrysostom his Testimony may in no wise be omitted, which seems to
your Disputers to be so Convincent, that your Bellar. lib. 2. de Buch. c. 22.
Cardinal placed it in the front of his host of the Fathers, whom he
produces, as able to break through an army of Adversaries alone; and Mr.
Master Brereley, Liturg. Tract. 2.. 4. Subd. 2. page 167.
Breerely reserved it to the last of the Testimonies, which he alleged, as
that which might serve for an Vpshot. I will conclude (says he) admonishing
the Christian Reader with Saint Chrysostom his Saying (you long to hear it,
we think:) Although Christ his speech (says Chrysostom. in Matthew. Hom. 83.
Etiamsi sensui, and cogitationi nostrae absurdum esse videatur quod dicit,
superatque sensum nostrum and rationem sermo ipsius, quaeso, quod in omnibus
rebus, sed praecipue in mysterijs faciamus? non illa quae ante nos iacent
aspicientes, sed verba tenentes? nam verbis eius defraudari non possumus, sed
sensus saepi^ fallitur. Quoniam igitur ille dixit [Hoc est Corpus meum] nulla
dubitatione teneamus, sed credamus, nihil enim insensibile traditur a Christo
nobis, sed in rebus sensibilibus. Omnia vero, quae tradidit, sunt insensibilia;
sicut in Baptismo per Aquam donum illud conceditur -- Regeperatio intelligitur,
quia est: nam si incorporeus esses, incorporea tibi tradisset dona; quoniam
vero anima conjuncta est Corpori, in sensibilibus intelligibilia tibi tradidit.
Chrysostom) may seem absurd unto Sense and Reason, Iexhort you
notwithstanding that especially in mysteries we look not unto that which is
before us, but observe Christ's words: for we cannot be disappointed of that,
which he says, but Senses may be deceived. Wherefore, because he said [This is
my Body] we are altogether to believe it, for he delivers no sensible things
unto us; but all which he delivers in things sensible are insensible: even as
in Baptism the gift of Regeneration granted us is Intelligible. For if thou
were without a Body, then things only unbodily should be given unto thee, but
now because thy Soul is joined with a Body, therefore in things sensible has
Christ delivered unto thee things intelligible. So Chrysostom.

Now what of all this? Chrysostom (says your Bellar. Non po^uisset sane
Chrysostomus loqui clariu's, si Calvinista^ aliquem habuisset, quem hor^ari ad
fidem voluisset. Ibid. quo supra.
Cardinal) could not speak more plainly, if he had had some Calvinist before
him, whom he meant to exhort to the Faith. So he, meaning the Faith of
Transubstantiation, which (as has been confessed) was no doctrine of Faith
until more than a Thousand years after Christ. But to return to Chrysostom,
whose Sentence we may compare to a Nut, consisting of a Shell, and a Kernel:
The Shell we may call his Figurative Phrases: the Kernel we may term his
Orthodox meaning. Of both in the Section following.

Of the Rhetorical, and Hyperbolicall Phrases of Chrysostom.

SECT. VI.
TO begin with the Shell. First, we are to know that Hyperbole is a Rhetorical
Trope, or Figure, which may be defined to be an Excessive speech, signifying a
Truth in an Untruth. As to say, Something is more dark than darkness it
self; which being strictly taken were an Impossibility, and Untrue: but it
does imply this Truth, (namely) that the thing is wonderfully, and extremely
dark.

Secondly, that Chrysostom was most frequent in this Figure Hyperbole, your
own Non sunt Concionatorum verba in rigore accipi^nda, quum primum ad aures
perveniant, multa enim per Hyperbolen Declamatores enunciant: ^^c interdum
Chrysostomo contingit. Senensis Biblioth. Annot. 152
Senensis does instruct you; where giving a general Caution, that Fathers in
their Sermons do use to declame Hyperbolically, he does instance most
specially, by name, in Chrysostom.

Thirdly, that the Excessive Phrases of Chrysostom, upon this Sacrament, do
verify as much, viz. to tell his people, that Dentes Carni suae infigere
Chrysostom. hom. 45. in Ioh. Lingua cruentatur hoc admi^abili Sanguine. Hom. 83.
in Matthew. Turbam circu^fusam rubifieri. Lib. 3. de Sacerdotio.
Their Teeth are fixed in the flesh of Christ: that Their tongues are bloodied
with his Blood: and that The Assembly of the People are made red therewith.

Fourthly, that he is as Hyperbolicall in denying (in the Celebration of this
Sacrament) the judgment of Senses, saying, Number vides Panem? number vinum? ne
putetis Corpus acc^pereab homine, sed ex ipso Sera^hinforcipe ignem. Idem. To^.
3. de Euch. in Encaenijs.
Do we see Bread, or Wine? which is spoken in as great an exuberancie of
speech as are the next words immediately following, saying: Think not that you
receive the Body from a man, but fire from a Seraphin, or Angel, with a pair
of Tongs. You will think (notwithstanding those kind of Phrases) that
Chrysostom thought he saw as well Bread, and Wine in this Sacrament, as he
could discern either Man from a Seraphin, or Spirit; or his own Fingers from a
pair of Tongs.

Fifthly, that the Sentence objected against us is adorned with the same figure
Hyperbole, when he says that No sensible thing is delivered unto us in this
Sacrament, and that our Senses herein may be deceived. Words sore pressed by
you, yet twice unconscionably; both because every Sacrament by your own Church
is defined to be Sacramentu^ est invisibilis gratiae signum visibile. Magist.
Senten. lib 4. did. 1. Sacramentum est res sensibus obiecta. Ca. tech. Trid.
Test Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram. c. 11.
A Sensible Sign; and also for that you your selves confess that Sensus non
fallitur circa proprium obiectum. Sententia vera. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap.
24.
Our senses cannot be deceived in their proper sensible Objects.

Sixthly, that Chrysostom himself well knew he did Hyperbolize herein, who
after that he had said, No sensible thing is delivered unto us in this
Sacrament; notwithstanding he adds immediately, saying of this Sacrament,
that In things Sensible, things Intelligible are given unto us. Thus far of
the Rhetorique of Chrysostom.

Now are we to show his Theology, and Catholic meaning, as it were the
Kernel of his speech. He in the same Sentence will have us understand Man to
consist of Body and Soul, and accordingly in this Sacrament Sensible things
are ministered to the Body, as Symbols of Spiritual things, which are for the
Soul to feed upon. So that a Christian, in receiving this Sacrament, is not
wholly to exercise his mind upon the bodily Object, as if that were only, or
principally the thing offered unto us; No, for then indeed our Senses would
deceive our Souls of their spiritual Benefit. As for Transubstantiation, and
Absence of Bread, Chrysostom, in true Sense, makes wholly against it, by
explaining himself, and paralleling this Sacrament with Baptism: As in
Baptism (says Sicut in Baptismo etc. Chrysostom. See above. 5. at (r.)
he) Regeneration, the thing intelligible, is given by water the thing
sensible, the Substance of water remaining. Which proportion, between the
Eucharist and Baptism, is held commonly by ancient See hereafter at large, in
the 8. Book.
Fathers, to the utter overthrow of Transubstantiation. And that Chrysostom
believed the Existence of Bread after Consecration, See above Chap. 3.. 13.
has been already expressly shown, and is here now further proved. For he
says of Bread after Consecration, that Nos per hunc Panem union coniungimur.
Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. hom. 24.
We are joined together one with another, by this Bread.

And now that you see the Nut cracked, you may observe how your Disputers have
swallowed the shell of Hyperbolicall Phrases, and left the kernel of
Theological Sense for us to content our selves withal. Furthermore (for this
is not to be omitted) the other Testimony of Chrysostom is spun and woven with
the same Art, which says of Consecrating this Sacrament, that Chrysostom. Homil.
50. in Matthew. iuxta Edit. Graec. Ne existimes Sacerdotem esse, qui hoc facit,
sed [(...).] then follows of Baptism, Ibid. Ille non te Baptizat, (...).]
Man is not to think it is the hand of the Priest, but of Christ himself,
that reaches it unto him; seeing immediately after (as it were with the same
breath) it is added: It is not the Minister, but God that Baptizeth thee, and
holds thy head. Thus far concerning the Judgment of Senses, which has
been formerly proved (at large) both by See above. c. 3.. 7.
Scriptures, and Ibid. in the Chapters following.
Fathers; we draw nearer our mark, which is your Transubstantiation.

Fourthly the Vnconscionablenes of your Disputers, in urging other Figurative
Sayings, and Phrases of the Fathers, of Bread Changed, Transmuted, etc. into
the Body of Christ, for proof of a Transubstantiation thereof in a Proper
Sense.

SECT. VII.
SVch words as these, Bread is the Body of Christ; It is made the Body of
Christ; It is Changed, Translated, Trans-muted, Transelementated into the Body
of Christ, are Phrases of the highest Emphasis that you can find in the Volumes
of Antiquity; which if they were literally meant, according to your Romish
Sense, there ought to be no further Dispute. But if it may evidently appear,
by the Idiome of speech of the same Fathers, that such their sayings are
Tropicall, and sometimes Hyperbolicall, then shall we have just Cause to tax
your Disputers of as great Vnconscionablenes (if not of more) in this, as in
any other.

For whenever they find in any Father (as in Eusebius Emiss. Ad est
Substantia Panis, sed post verba Christi est Corpus Christi. Hom. 5. Objected
by Mr. Breerly. Liturg. Tract. 2.. 2. Subd. 2.
Eusebius) these words; The Bread is the Body of Christ, they object it for
Transubstantiation; but Unconscionably. First, seeing that the Fathers do but
herein imitate our Lord and Master Christ, who said of the Bread [This is my
Body:] which has been See above, Book 2. throughout.
proved by Scriptures, and Fathers to be a Figurative and unproper speech.
Secondly, seeing that they use the same Dialect in other things, as Cyrill of
Sacred Oil, saying, this is Charisma, the Gift of Grace; as he called also
the Holy Kiss a (...) Cyrill. sup.
Reconciliation, and others the like, as you have heard. Thirdly, seeing that
you your selves have renounced all proper Sense of all such Speeches, because
things of different natures cannot possibly be affirmed one of another; for no
more can it be properly said Bread is man's Body, than we can say, An Egg is a
Stone, as you have See above, Book 2 c. 1.. 4.
confessed. Again, Some Fathers say, Bread is made Flesh, as Ambros. De Pa^e;
Fit Corpus caro Christi. O^. by Bellar. lib. 2 de Euchar. c. 14. and by others.
S. Ambrose. objected; but Unconscionably, knowing First, that you your selves
are brought now at length to deny the Body of Christ to be Produced out of
Bread. Secondly, knowing the like Idiome of Fathers in their other speeches;
Chrysostom. saying that Chrysostom. Nos secum Christus in unam, ut ita dicam,
massam reducit, neque id fide tantum, sed reipsa nos Corpus suum effecit. In
Math. 26. hom. 83. Ob. by Mr. Breerly. Liturg. Tract. 2.. 2. Subd* 2.
Christ has made us his own Body, not only in Faith, but in deed also: And
Augustine saying that Aug. Ipsi Christiani cum Capite ^uo, quod ascendit in
coelum, vnus est Christus. Enarrat. in Psalm. 127. Etin Psalm. 26. Titulus Psalm^
Omnes in illo, and Christi, and Christus sumus.
Christians themselves with their Head, which ascended into heaven, are one
Christ: yea, and Pope Leo, De homine Regenerato per Baptismum. Vt susceptus a
Christo, and suscipiens Christum, non idem sit post Lavacru^, quod ante
Baptismum fuit, sed ut corpus Regenerati fiat ^aro Crucifixi. Sermon. de
Passione. 14.
Leo, saying of the party Baptized, that He is not the same that he was before
Baptism, by which (says he) the Body of the party Regenerate is made the
Flesh of Christ crucified. Finally, Venerable Bede says; Beda in 1. Cor. 10.
Nam and nosipsius Corpus facti sumus, and quod accipimus, nos sumus.
We are made that Body which we receive. In all which the word [Made] you
know, is far from that high strain of Transubstantiation. We draw yet
nearer to the Scope.

We may not deny, but that the Fathers sometimes extend their voices higher,
unto the Praeposition Trans; as See above C. 4.. 7.
Transit, Transmutatur, signifying a Change, and Trans-mutation into the Body
of Christ. Every such Instance is, in the opinion of your Doctors, a full
demonstration of Transubstantiation it self; and all the wits of men cannot
(says one) Assoyle such Objections. Wherein they show themselves altogether
Unconscionable, as has been partly declared in Answering your Objected
Sayings of See above C. 4.. 2.
Ambrose In aliud Convertuntur; of Ibid. at the Letter (r.)
Cyprian his Panis natura mutatus; of Cyrils Trans-mutavit; and as now in this
Section is to be manifested, in answering your other Objections to the full.

The Father Gregor. Nyssen. Quicquid assumenti conveniens est, and expetitum
sit, ut Apostolus vult, qui hanc mensam nobis praeparavit, in id commutatur;
infirmioribus olus, Infantibus Lac, etc. Lib. de vita Mosis. p. 509.
Greg. Nyssen comparing the Body of Christ with Manna, which satisfied every
man's taste that received it, says that The Body of Christ in this Sacrament is
changed into whatsoever seems to the Receivers appetite convenient and
desired. This is objected by your Cardinal, to prove Transubstantiation; but
First Unconscionably; because it is in it self (being literally understood)
even in your own judgments, incredible: For what Christian will say that the
Body of Christ is Transubstantiated into any other thing? much less into
whatsoever thing the appetite of the Receiver shall desire? No. But as Manna
did satisfy the bodily Appetite: so Christ's Body to the Faithful is food
satisfying the Soul in the Spiritual and heavenly desire thereof. Secondly,
Unconscionably objected, because the same Father expresses his Hyperbolicall
mannet of speech likewise, saying that Greg. Nyss. Corpus illud Christi in
Corpus nost^um ingrediens totum in se transfert. Ob. by Bellar. lib. 2. cap.
10.. Idem Greg.
Christ's Body does change our Bodies into it self, which in the Literal
Sense, according to your arguing, would prove a Transubstantiation of Men's
Bodies into Christ.

Chrysostom is found admiring these mysteries, and is objected by Mr. Mr.
Breerly. Tract. 2.. 4 Subd 2 p. 164.
Breerly, for proof of the wonderful Effects of this Sacrament. Why? what
says he? Chrysostom. Admiranda Mysteria -- ut non solum per dil^ctione^, sed
reipsa in illam Carnem co^vertamur. Hom. 45. in Ioh.
We our selves (says he) are converted and changed into the Flesh of Christ.
Which was the former saying of Greg. Nyssen. Will your Disputers never learn
the Hyperbolicall language of ancient Fathers, especially when they speak of
Sacramental, and mystical things? (more especially Chrysostom, who, when he
falls upon this Subject, does almost altogether Rhetoricate:) but chiefly
when they cannot be ignorant that such words of the Fathers, in the Literal
strain, are utterly absurd. For what greater Absurdity than (as is now
objected) for our Bodies to be Transubstantiated into the Body of Christ? Now
are we past the limits of due Antiquity, you descend lower.

Theophylact will say hard to us, who, speaking of this Sacrament, says indeed
that Theoph. in Mar^. 14. Vocat hanc Conversionem Transelementationem, quae
quidem vox nihil minus significat, quam transubstantiatio: na^ Transeleme^tatio
significat mutationem totius rei -- ad ipsam materiam, quae ab Aristotele
Elementum dicitur. Si mu^atio solius Formae, recte dicitur (...) Transformatio,
and mutatio, externae figurae transfiguratio, cur mutatio substantiae non
poterit recte dici Transubstantiatio? Bella. l. 3. de Euch. c. 23.. Secundo.
The Bread is Trans-elementated into the Body of Christ: which your Cardinal
will have to be, in the same Fathers sense, Equivalent with your
Transubstantiation. Unconscionably, for does not the same Father say likewise
that Theoph. in Ioh. 6. Qui me manducat, quodammodo (...).
A Christian is in a manner Trans-elementated into Christ? Like as Isidore
Pelusiota spoke of Isidor. Pelusiot. l. 3. Epist. 107. De recipiente semen, ut
terra bona: Qui verbu recipit [(...).]
Trans-elementing, in a sort, of the word of God into the good hearer. Again,
Theophylact is objected, as saying, Theoph in Mat. 26. Panis ineffabili modo
transformatur -- Panis quidem apparet, sed ca^^ ^st. Objected by Mr. Breerly
Liturg. Tract. 2. Sect. 2. Subd. 2. As for [est caro] this Phrase has been
already answered. See above at (s)
The Bread is after an ineffable manner Transformed. It is true; He says so:
and so does Hi^rome say that Hier. in Marc. 14. Accepit Jesus Panem, and
benedixit, fregit, Transsigurans corpus suum in Panem: quod est Ecclesia
praesens, quae frangitur in passionibus.
Christ in breaking Bread, did Transfigure, or Transform his Body into his
Church broken with afflictions: and Pope Leo sticks not to say that Leo. Non
alia igitur participatio Corporis, quam ut in id, quod su^imus, transeamus. De
passi^e Sermon. 24.
We Christians, in communicating [Transimus] turn, or are Changed into Christ
his Body. So these ancient Fathers.

Are you not yet out of breath with obiecting Testimonies of Fathers
Unconscionably, and Impertinently? No, for Mr. Breerly, for a Close, desires
to be heard, and to try us with an Objection out of the Greek Church of these
latter times, as follows. Mr. Breerly in his Apologic (of the first Edition)
concerning the faith of the ancient Greek Church.
It appears by a Treatise published by the Protestant Divines at Wittenberge,
Anno Domini 1584. entitled [Acta Theologorum Wittembergensium, and Hieremiae
Patriarchae Constantinop. etc.] that the Greek Church at this day (although
divided from the Latin) professes to believe Transubstantiation. So he of
the Patriarch Hieremias; which Patriarch, if we were alive, would very hardly
conteyne himself from answering this your Brother with some indignation,
calling him both rash and praecipitant; seeing that the same Patriarch
expressly said that Hier. Patriarch. Non enim hic nominis tantum communicatio
est, sed rei identitas: etenim vere corpus and sanguis Christi mysteria sunt;
non quod haec in corpus humanum transmutentur, sed nos in illa, melioribus
praevalentibus. Which is his Answer in this point, to the Doctors of
Wittemberge.
These Mysteries are not changed into humane Flesh.

Mr. Breerly would think it an injury done unto himself, if we should
praetermit his objected Authority of Pope Gregory: for Doctor Humphrey (says
he) does charge Gregory the Great with Transubstantiation. So Mr. Breerly, who
objected this in his Apology many years ago, and had a full Answer in an
Appeal. lib. 1. Chapter 2.. 7. [The testimony it self, cited out of Greg. by Mr.
Breerly, is answered in the first Book, concerning EATING.
Appeal made purposely in confutation of his whole Apology. The Sum of that
Answer is this: Doctor Humphrey did not speak that, as grounded upon any
Sentence of Gregory, but only upon the report of a Romish Legend (supposing it
to be true) which in the judgment of Romish Doctors themselves (whose
Testimonies are there cited) Is unworthy to report the memory of the fact,
being in it self fond, filthy and frivolo^s; the Author whereof may seem to
have a face of Ir^n, and a heart of Lead; and the Obiectour, namely Mr.
Breerly (for grounding his Objection on a Legendary History) A Falsifier of
his own promise. This Answer was home, one would think, and might justly have
provoked him to satisfy for himself; if he could have found any error
therein: yet notwithstanding, for want of better service, brings he in these
Coleworts twice sod.

CHALLENGE.
What greater Inconsionableness could your Disputers bewray, than by so
torturing the Hyperbolicall Figurative, and Sacramental Sayings of Ancient
Fathers for proof of the Transubstantiation of Bread into the Body of Christ?
insomuch that they must be consequently constrained, by the force of some
Phrases, contrary both to the meaning of the same Fathers, and to the Doctrine
of your own Romish Church, to admit of three other Transubstantiations: viz.
First, of Christ his Body into what soever the Appetite of the Communicant
shall desire. Secondly of Christ his Body into the Body of every Christian. And
Thirdly of the Body of every Christian into the Body of Christ; as the
Testimonies objected plainly pronounce. In all which Objections they do but
verify the Proverb: Qui nimis em^ngit, elicit sanguinem.

Fifthly, the like Inconsionableness of your Romish Disputers is unmasked, by
laying open the Emphaticall Speeches of the Fathers, concerning Baptism,
answerable to their Sayings objected, for proof of Transubstantiation in the
Eucharist.

SECT. VIII.
COncerning Baptism we have See above in this Chap.. 3. etc.
heard already, out of the Writings of Antiquity, as efficacious Terms, as you
could object for the Eucharist. First of the Party Baptized, Changed into a new
Creature. Secondly, that no Sensible thing is delivered in Baptism. Thirdly,
that The Baptized is not the same, but changed into Christ his flesh. Fourthly,
to think that It is not the Priest, but God that Baptizeth, who holds thy
head. Lastly, Baptism (says the Council of Book 8. Chapter 2.. 1. Conc. Nicen.
Baptisma non Corporis, sed mentis oculis considerandum. Apud Bini^m. lib. 3.
Decret. Conc^ Nic. de Baptismate.
Nice) is to be considered not with the Eyes of the Body. Of these already, and
hereafter much more in a General Synopsis reserved for the Eight Book.

CHALLENGE.
ONly give us lean to spur you a Question before we end this third Book.
Seeing that Transubstantiation cannot properly be, by your own Doctrine,
except the Substance of Bread ceasing to be there remain only the Accidents
thereof (this Position of the continuance of Only Accidents, without a
Subject, being your Positive Foundation of Transubstantiation) Why is it that
none of all your Romish Disputers was hitherto ever able to produce any one
Testimony out of all the Volumes of Antiquity, for proof of this one point,
excepting only that of Cyril, which See above, Chapter 4.. 4.
has been (as you have heard) egregiously abused and falsified? Learn you to
Answer this Question, or else shame to object Antiquity any more; but rather
confess your Article of Transubstantiation to be but a Bastardly Impe.

We might enlarge our selves in this point of your Inconsionableness in
obiecting Testimonies of Fathers, for proof as well of Transubstantiation, as
of the other Articles abovementioned; but that they are to be presented in
their proper places, to wit in the following Treatises, concerning Corporal
Presence, Corporal Union, Corporal Sacrifice of Christ's Body in the
Sacrament, and the Divine Adoration thereof; so plainly that any man may be
persuaded, our Opposites mean no good Faith, in arguing from the Judgment of
Ancient Fathers.

Hitherto of the First Romish Consequence.
THE FOVRTH BOOK,
Treating of the second Romish Consequence, arising from the false Exposition
of these words of Christ, [THIS IS MY BODY] called Corporal Presence in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist.

THe Sacramental Presence has a double Relation, one is in respect of the
thing sensibly received, which is the Sacrament it self; the other in respect
of the Receiver and Communicant: Both which are to be distinctly considered, as
well for our right discerning of the matter in hand, as also for Method's sake.
The first is handled in this Book: the second in that which follows.

CHAP. I.
Of the state of this point of Controversy:

That notwithstanding the difference of opinion of Christ's Presence be only De
modo, that is, of the manner of Being; yet may the Romish Doctrine be
Heretical: and to hold the contrary is a pernicious Paradoxe.

SECT. I.
IT would be a wonder to us, to hear Any of our own profession to be so
extremely Indifferent, concerning the different opinions of the Manner of the
Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, as to think the Romish Sect
therefore either Tolerable, or Reconciliable, upon Pretense that the Question
is only De modo, (that is) of the manner of Being, and that consequently all
Controversy about this is but vain Iangling. Such an one ought to enter into
his second thoughts, to consider the necessity that lies upon every Christian
to abandon diverse Heresies, albeit their difference from the Orthodoxe
profession were only De modo. As for example, First, The Gnostick taught man's
soul to have it is beginning by manner of Production, from the substance of
God. The Catholics said nay, but by manner of Creation, of nothing. The
Pelagians maintained a free will in spiritual Acts, from the grace of Nature.
The Catholics nay; but by special grace of Christ, freeing the will through
the efficacious operation of his holy Spirit. The Catharists held themselves
pure, in a purity of an absolute perfection: The Catholics nay, but by an
Inchoative, comparative, and imperfect perfection of purity. Furthermore
against our Christian Faith, of believing God to be absolutely a Spirit; the
Anthrepomorphites conceived of God, as of one (after the manner of men)
consisting of Arms and Legs, etc.

Not to be tedious. We come to the Sacraments. The Cataphrygae did not baptize
in the name of the blessed Trinity, after the manner of the Catholics. The
Artotyritae celebrated the Eucharist in Bread and Cheese. To omit many others,
take one poniard, which we are sure will pierce into the entrails of the Cause
(to wit) the heresy of the Capernaits, in the days of our Savior Christ: who
hearing his Sermon, teaching men to Eat his flesh; and conceiving thereby a
carnal manner of Eating, irreconciliably contrary to the spiritual manner,
which was believed by the true Disciples of Christ, departed from Christ, and
Apostated from the Faith. And that the Romish manner of Eating Christ his Body
is Capernaiticall; her manner of Sacrifice sacrilegious; her manner of Divine
Adoration thereof Idolatrous; and all these manners Irreconciliable to the
manner of our Church, is copiously declared in the Books following. For this
present we are to exhibit the different, and contradictory manners, concerning
the Presence of Christ herein.

The manner of Presence of Christ his Body 1. According to the Judgment of
Protestants. 2. In the profession of the Church of Rome.

That Protestants, albeit they deny the Corporal Presence of Christ in this
Sacrament; yet hold they a true Presence thereof in diverse respects; according
to the Judgment of Antiquity.

SECT. II.
THere may be observed four kinds of Truths of Christ his Presence in this
Sacrament: one is veritas Signi, that is Truth of Representation of Christ his
Body; the next is Veritas Revelationis, Truth of Revelation; the third is
Veritas Obsignationis, that is, a Truth of Seal, for better assurance; the
last is, Veritas Exhibitionis, the truth of Exhibiting, and deliverance of the
Real Body of Christ to the faithful Communicants. The Truth of the Sign, in
respect of the thing signified, is to be acknowledged so far, as in the
Signs of Bread and Wine is represented the true and Real Body and Blood of
Christ. which Truth and Reality is celebrated by us, and taught by ancient
Fathers, in contradiction to Manichees, Marcionites, and other old Heretics;
who held that Christ had in himself no true Body, but merely Fantastical,
as you Marcionitae, Manichaei, and alij Haeretici putabant corpus Christi verum
non esse, sed phantasticu^ esse. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 24. Resp.
Argumentum.
your selves well know. In confutation of which Heretics the Father Ignatius
(as your Ignatius (citante Theodoret. Dlal. 3.) Eucharistia est caro Christi.
Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 2. Hoc scripsit Ignatius contra Haereticos, qui
negabant Christu^ habuisse carnem veram, sed tantum visibilem and apparentem.
-- Observandum est Haereticos illos non tam Sacramentu^ Euch. qua^ mysterium
incarnationis oppugnasse. [True, and the Argument of Ignatius was the same
which Tert* used also against the same kind of Heretics. Lib. 4. in Marcion.
[Hoc est corpus meum] Id est, figura corporis mei: Figura autem non fuisset,
nisi veritas esset corpus. See this in the place of Tertullian at large.
Cardinal witnesses) called the Eucharist it self, the flesh of Christ.
Which saying of Ignatius, in the sense of Theodoret, (by whom he is cited,
against the Heresy of his time) does call it Flesh and Blood of Christ,
because (as the same Theodoret expounded himself) it is a true sign of the
true and Real Body of Christ: and, as Tertullian long before him had explained
the words of Christ himself [This is my Body] that is (says he) This Bread
is a Sign, or Figure of my Body. Now because it is not a Sign, which is not
of some Truth, ( See above Book 2. Chap. 2. at (a.)
for as much as there is not a figure of a figure) therefore Bread being a
sign of Christ's Body, it must follow, that Christ had a true Body. This
indeed is Theological arguing, by a true Sign of the Body of Christ to
confute the Heretics, that denied the Truth of Christ's Body. Which
controlleth the wisdom of your Concilium dicit vero contineri corpus in
Sacramento contra Sacramentarios, qui volunt Christum adesse in Signo, and
Figura: signa enim veritati opponuntur. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap 2.
Council of Trent, in condemning Protestants, as denying Christ to be Truly
present in the Sacrament, because, they say, he is there present in a Sign. As
though there were no Truth of being in a Sign, or Figure; which were to
abolish all true Sacraments, which are true Figures, and Signs of the things
which they represent.

A second Truth and Reality in this Sacrament is called Veritas Revelationis,
as it is a sign, in respect of the Typical Signs of the same Body, and Blood
of Christ in the Rites of the old Testament; yet not absolutely in respect of
the matter it self, but of the manner, because the faithful under the Law had
the same faith in Christ, and therefore their Sacraments had Relation to the
same Body, and Blood of Christ, but in a difference of manner. For as two
Cherubins looked on the same Mercy Seat, but with different faces oppositely:
so did both Testaments point out the same Passion of Christ in his Body, but
with diverse aspects. For the Rites of the old Testament were, as Augustine.
contra Faustum lib. 19. page 349. Tom. 6. Delirat, qui dicit mutatis
Sacramentis res ipsas diversas esse, quas ritus Propheticus pronunciavit
implendas, and quas ritus Euangelicus annunciavit im^^^tas. -- aliter res
annunciatur facienda, aliter facta.
Saint Augustine teaches, Prophetical prenunciating, and foretelling the
thing to come: but the rites of the new Testament are Historical, annunciating
and revealing the thing done, the former showed, concerning Christ his Passion,
rem faciendam, what should be; the latter rem factam, the thing done, and
fulfilled. As therefore the Truth of History is held to be more real than the
Truth of Prophecy, because it is a declaration of a real performance of that,
which was promised: So the Evangelicall Sacrament may be said to contain in it
a more real verity, then the Leviticall. Therefore are the Rites of the old
Law called Heb. 10.
Shadows, in respect of the Sacraments of the Gospel; according to the which
difference Saint John the Baptist was called by Christ a Prophet, in that he
Ioh. 1. 15.
foretold Christ, as now to come: but he was called more then a Prophet, as
demonstrating and Ibid. 29.
pointing him out to be now come. Which Contemplation occasioned diverse Fathers
to speak so Hyperbolically of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, in comparison of
the Sacraments of the old Testament, as if the Truth were in these, and not in
them, as Origin. Hom. 7. in Numer. p. 195. Illa in aenigmate designari, quae
nunc in nova lege in specie and veritate complentur. [Calling ours Truth, yet
not simply, but comparatively: for a little after he confesses that they
received Eandem Escam; i. e. Christum] Objected by Mr. Breerley Liturg. Tract.
4. Sect. 2. Subd. 4
Origin did.

Besides the former two, there is Veritas Obsignationis, a Truth sealed, which
makes this Sacrament more than a Sign, even a Seal of Gods promises in
Christ; for so the Apostle called Circumcision (albeit a Sacrament of the old
Law) the Romans 4. 11.
Seal of Faith. But yet the print of that Seal was but dim, in comparison
of the Evangelicall Sacraments; which because they confirm unto the faithful
the Truth, which they present, are called by other ancient Fathers (as well as
by Aug. tom. 4. de Catechizand. rudib. c. 26. Signacula esse visibilia rerum
divinarum.
Saint Augustine) visible Seals of divine things. So that now we have in this
Sacrament the Body of Christ not only under a Sign or signification, but under
a Seal of Confirmation also: which infers a greater degree of real Truth,
thereby represented unto us. This might have been the reason, why Saint
Augustine taught Christ to be Aug. tract. 50. in Ioh. Habemus Christum in
praesenti ad Baptismatis Sacramentum: habemus in praesenti ad Altaris cibu^ and
potum. Tom. 9
Present both in Baptism, and at receiving the Lord's Supper.

A fourth Reason to be observed herein, as more special, is Veritas
Exhibitionis, a Truth Exhibiting and delivering to the faithful Communicants
the thing signified, and sealed, which Christ expressed, when he delivered it
to his Disciples, saying; [Take, eat, this is my Body given for you: and, this
is my Blood shed for you.] Thus Christ, by himself; and so does he to other
faithful Communicants wheresoever, to the ends of the World, by his Ministers,
as by his hands, through virtue of that Royal Command, [DOE THIS.] Vain
therefore is the Objection made by your Athanas. apud Theodoret. Dial. 2. page
330. Corpus est, cui dicit, sede a dexteris meis -- per quod corpus Pontifex
fuit, and dictus est, per id quod tradidit mysterium, dicens; Hoc est corpus
meum. This was objected by Bellarmine l. 2. de Euch. c. 11.
Cardinal, in urging us with the testimony of Athanasius, to prove that Christ
his Body is exhibited to the Receivers; As though there were not a Truth in a
mystical, and sacramental deliverance of Christ his Body, except it were by a
corporal, and material presence thereof: which is a transparent falsity, as
any may perceive by any Deed of Gift, which by writing, seal, and delivery
conveyeth any Land or Possession from man to man; yet this far more
effectually, as afterward will appear. But first we are to manifest.

That the Romish Disputers do odiously, slanderously, and unconscionably
vilify the Sacrament of the Eucharist, as it is celebrated by PROTESTANTS.

object against Protestants, saying, that Their Sacrament is nothing else but a
crust of Bread, and pittance of Wine. And again; A morsel of Bread ill baked,
by which the Protestants represent unto their memories the death of Christ, and
the benefits thereof. A goodly matter! so does a Crucifix: and to make the
Sacrament only a Sign is an ancient Heresy. So they.

But have you not heard the Doctrine of the Protestants teaching the
Eucharisticall Bread to be (more than bare Bread) a Sacramental sign; more,
an Evangelicall sign; more, a sacred Seal; yet more, an exhibiting Instrument
of the Body of Christ therein to the devout Receiver? And have not these
outrageous Spirits read your own Cardinal? witnessing that the Protestants
teach that Doect Calvinus Symbola, and corpus Christi, licet loco inter se
plurimum distent; tamen coniuncta esse, non solu^ ratione signi; quia unum est
signum alterius; sed quia per signum Deus vere nobis exhibet ipsum corpus

c. 1. Et Calvinus affirmat saepius, Christi corpus esse praesens in Sacramento,

enim loquitur, secundu^ substantiam, non modo secundu^ effectum. Et Fortunatus
Calvinista dicit in Sacrame^to corpus Christi versari realissime que percipi.

quidem ore mentis, non dentis, id est, per fidem and coniunctionem, virtute
Spiritus Sancti in animo communicantis: sacramentaliter etiam, ore quidem
corporis sumendo, non ipsum quidem corpus eius, sed signum corporis eius,
panem, and vinum, quae dicit esse sigilla certa, quibus promissio redemptionis
in corpore and sanguine Christi fidelibus obsignatur. Valent. quo supra.
Although the Body of Christ be still in Heaven, yet is it received in this
Sacrament; first Sacramentally by Bodily mouths, in receiving the Bread, the
sign of Christ his Body, and by which God does truly, albeit Sacramentally,
deliver unto the faithful the real body of Christ: and secondly spiritually
to the mouth of the soul by faith, and so they truly and really participate of
the substance of the Body and Blood of Christ. So Bellarmine, concerning
Protestants, which is so plainly professed by Calvin. in his Book entitled,
Defensio Calvini de Sacramento. Augustana Confessio; [In sacra Coena vere dari

Calvin himself, as would make any Romish Adversary blush at your former
Calumnies, who has not abandoned shamefastness it self.

CHALLENGE.
THus may you see that we have not hitherto so pleaded for the Existence of the
Substance of Bread in this Sacrament, after Consecration, as thereby to exclude
all Presence of Christ his body; nor so maintained the propriety of a Sign,
or Figure, as not to believe the thing signified to be exhibited unto us, as
you have heard. With what black spot of malignity and falsehood then were the
Consciences of those your Doctors defiled, think you, who have imputed to
Protestants a Profession of using only bare Bread, which they notwithstanding
teach and believe to be a Sacred Sign of the true Body of Christ, in
opposition to Heretics; an Evangelicall Sign of the Body of the Messiah
crucified, against all Jewish conceit; yea a Seal of Ratification; yea and
also a Sacramental Instrument of conveying of the same precious Body of Christ
to the souls of the faithful, by an happy and ineffable Conjunction; whereof
more hereafter in the In the fist Book throughout.
Book following, where the consonant Doctrine of the Church of England will
likewise appear.

And as your Disputers are convinced of a malicious Detraction, by the
confessed positions of Protestants, so are they much more by your own instance
of a Crucifix: for which of you would not hold it a great derogation from
Christ, that any one seeing a Crucifix of wood (now waxen old) should in
disdain thereof call it a wooden, or rotten Block: and not account them
irreligious in so calling it? but why? only because it is a sign of Christ
crucified. Notwithstanding, were the Crucifix as glorious as either Art could
fashion, or Devotion affect, or Superstition adore, yet is it but a sign
invented by man; And therefore how infinitely more honorable in all Christian
estimation must a Sacramental Sign be, which only the God of Heaven and
Earth could institute, and Christ has ordained to his Church, far exceeding
the property of a bare sign, as you have heard? A Father delivering by
politic assurances under hand and seal a portion of Land, although an
hundred miles distant, and convaying it to his son by Deed, if the son in
scorn should term the same Deed or writing black Ink; the Seal greasy
Wax; and the whole Act but a bare sign, were he not worthy not only to loose
this fatherly benefit, but also to be deprived of all other the temporal
Blessings of a Father, which he might otherwise hope to enjoy? yet such like
have been your Calumnies, and opprobrious Reproaches against our celebration
of the Sacrament of Christ. The Lord lay not them to your Charge.

Now you, who so oppose against the Truth of the mystical Presence, will not
conceal from us that Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ, which your
Church does so extremely dote on.

CHAP. II.
The Romish professed manner of Presence of Christ's Body in this Sacrament.

SECT. I.
Our Method requires to consult, in the first place, in all questions, with
the words of Christ his Institution; but seeing that you can allege nothing
for proof of a Corporal Presence of Christ in this Sacrament, but only a
literal Exposition of Christ's words [This is my Body;] which by Scriptures,
Fathers, your own Principles, and by unanswerable Reasons has been Book 2.
proved to be most grossly false, we shall not need to insist further upon
that; only we shall but put you in mind of Saint Paul's words, in teaching the
use and end of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament, to wit, The showing of
Christ's death until his coming again: meaning corporally, at the last day.
Which word [VNTILL] being spoken of a last day does exclude your coming again
of Christ in his Corporal Presence every day; for the Apostles word is
absolutely spoken of his Bodily Coming, and not of the manner thereof; albeit
other Scripture teaches, that his Coming must be in all glorious Visibility.
We go on.

In the Eucharist (says your Si quis negaverit in sanctissima Eucharistia
contine^i vere, realiter, substantialiter corpus, and sanguinem Christi
Anathema sit. Council. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 1. Nos dicimus Dominum Christum
corporaliter sub specie panis co^tineri. Greg. Valent. Tom. 4. disp. 6. q. 3.
p. 1.
Council of Trent) is contained truly, really, and substantially the Body, and
blood of Christ: and they account him Accursed, whosoever shall not believe
this. By all which is signified a Corporal manner of presence (excepting only
Relation to place) which we say is, in many respects, impossible, as we shall
prove; but first we are to remove a Mil-stone, for so you esteem an Objection,
which you cast in our way of Demonstration of a Corporal Presence, de facto,
from (as you say) Miracles manifesting the same.

The pretended principal Romish Demonstration of a Corporal Presence of
Christ's Body and Blood in this Sacrament, taken from pretended Supremuslocus
detur miraculis; veluti testimonijs ipsius Dei. ^ozius de signis Eccles. l. 14.
c. 7. p. 170.
Miraculous Apparitions of visible Flesh, and Blood, revealed to the World.

SECT. II.
TRue Miracles we shall hold as God's Seals of Divine Truth: if therefore you
shall allege any such, for proof of a Corporal Presence, see they be true,
else shall we judge them, not to be God's Seals, but the Devils Counterfaits.
Your Bozius, one of the number of the Congregation of the Oratory in Rome
(professedly studied in historical learning, and appointed to extract out of
all Authors, whatsoever may make for defense of all Romish Causes) after his
diligent search into all ancient Records, as it were into the Warehouses of
all ^orts of stuffes, having collected a packet of Apparances, uses his best
Eloquence to set forth his merchandise to sale; telling us by the way of
Preface, Hi^ ea tantummodo referemus, quibus est palam factum divinitus in
Eucharistia verum corpus esse, and oculi humani viderunt, and quod est omnium
mirabilissimum videre adhuc possint panem conversum in ipsum carnem Christi.
Bozius de Sig. Eccles. l. 14. c. 7.
that he will report only such Stories, whereby it is made Evident by God
himself, that the Body of Christ is in the Eucharist, even by the Testimony of
men's eyes, that have seen it. A thing (says he) most miraculous, which every
one that has eyes may yet see. So he, even as Coccius Thesaur. Cathol. lib. 6.
de Eucharistia.
Coccius before him in every particular: and after both Master In the place
below-cited.
Brereley thus prefacing; Miracles sent by God confirm the same, wherein at the
breaking of the Host, sundry times great copy of blood issued out, as is
testified by many Writers. We are now attentive to the Relation of your Orator
and Others, and afterward (as you shall perceive) to give that credit unto
them, which the cause it self shall require. We will take their Relations
according to the order of Times.

1. Anno CCCC. Simon Metaphrastes Simon Metaphrastes narrat, etc. Bozius ibid.
(says Bozius) tells in the days of Honorius the Emperor (for the
confirmation of the faith of an Eremite) that the Sacrament being propounded,
presently [Infans visus est] a living Infant was seen by three old men on the
Altar: and whilst the Priest divided the Bread, an Angel was seen, and seemed
to divide, and cut in pieces the flesh of the Child, and so [Senex carnis
cruentae aperte particeps factus est, and resipiscit.] The old Heremite being
made partaker evidently of the Bloody flesh, repented.

2. Anno 600. A woman (as Johannes, and Paulus Diaconus in vita Gregorij
narrat, etc. Bozius ibid. and Coccius Thesaur. lib. 6. de Euch. art. 8. Anno
590. And Master Brerely Tract. 4. Sect. 3. Subd. 1. out of Paulus Diaconus de
vita Greg. lib. 2. c. 41.
Bozius reports, and with him Coccius) had laughed to hear the Bread called
the Body of Christ, which she her self had made with her own hands, and was
observed to laugh by Pope Gregory: who thereupon fell to prayer with the
people, and by and by looking aside upon the Host, behold the forms of Bread
were vanished, and he saw [Veram carnem] true flesh: Then the people wondered,
the woman repented, and the Host, at the prayer of the Priest [in pristinam
formam reversa est] Returned into its own shape again.

3. Anno 800. Ante Annos prope octingentos, ut narrat Pas^asius, quidem
Presbyter, etc. Bozius ibid. and Coccius.
A certain Priest called Phlegis, being desirous to see Christ in the
Eucharist, not that he doubted thereof, but that he might receive some
heavenly comfort [Divinitus] from God, after prayers for this purpose, he saw
(after Consecration, Puerum Iesum, The Child Jesus) in the Host, [and
amplexatus est eum, and post multam deosculationem, etc.] he embraced him, and
after much kissing of him, he desired to receive the Sacrament, and the Vision
vanished, and he received it. So he. These two last, are also alleged by your
Cardinal Bellar. lib. 3. de Each. c. 8. Deus non est te^^is m^ndacij, etc.
Bellarmine.

4. Not many years after a fourth in Italy, Ex Guitmundo, and Lanfranco,
Bozius and Coccius ibid.
A Priest saying Mass, and finding [Veram carnem super Altar, verumque
sanguinem in Calice,] True flesh upon the Altar, and true Blood in the C^p,
fearing to receive it, forthwith reported it to the Bishop, demanding what he
should do; The Bishop consulteth with the other Bishops his Brethren, by whose
common consent the Priest taking the Cup and the flesh, shut them up in the
midst of the Altar, [Haec pro divinissimis miraculis summa cum reverentia
servanda decrevit:] The Bishop decreed, that these should be perpetually
reserved, and kept as most divine Relics.

5. Anno 1050. Tempore quo, vrge^te nefando Berengario, haec in controversiam
sunt adducta, ut Deus adstipulatus intelligatur veritati, and refragatus
errori, etc. Baron^ 1059. number. 20. ex Petro Damiano.
Cardinal Baronius will needs have you know, that Berengarius was confirmed by
a like miracle from God, as the Bishop of Amalphi (says he) witnesses to Pope
Stephen upon his oath; That when he was doubting of the truth of the Body of
Christ, in the Sacrament, at the breaking of the Host [Rubra and perfecta caro
inter eius manus apparuit, it a ut digitos eius ^r^entaret] Red and perfect
flesh appeared betwixt his hands, insomuch that his hands were bloodied
therewith.

6. Anno 1192. Behold an History (says your Quae admiranda hoc seculo in
Slavorum Historia, authore Helmoldo Abbate, huius seculi narrantur fide
dignissima, acc^pe. His ferme diebus, etc. Baron. anno 1192, number. 20, and 21.
Haec de Transubstantiatione: confutavi^ item idem miraculu^ Haeresin nuper
obortam ^egantium aqua^ vino mixtam mutari in sanguinem. Baron. ibid. number. 24.
Cardinal Baronius) most worthy of belief (you must believe it.) At Thuring
after that the Priest had given the Sacrament to a young Girl then sick, and
had washed his fingers in a pot of water, she observing it very diligently,
willed them that were by to uncover the water, for I saw (said she) a piece of
the Eucharist fall out of the hands of the Priest into it: which being brought
unto her to drink, all the water was turned into Blood, and the piece of the
Host, albeit no bigger than a man's finger, was turned [In sanguineam carnem]
into a bloody flesh. All that see it are in horror, the Priest himself,
suspecting his own negligence, fears, and wishes that it may be burned.
After was this made known, and divulged to the Bishop of Mentz. This
Archbishop commands his Clergy to attend upon this, whilst it should be
carried in public procession until they came into the Church of the blessed
Virgin Mary where prayers are made by the Archbishop, that God would be pleased
to retransforme this [in primam substantiam panis, and vini] into the former
substance of Bread and Wine: and so at length it came to pass. Thus far the
Story. This (says the same Cardinal) makes for Transubstantiation, and
confuteth the Heresy of those that deny that water mixed with the Eucharist is
turned into Blood. So he.

7. Anno 1230. Bozius quo supra ex Viliano.
A Priest in Florence looking into the Chalice saw drops of Blood divided into
parts, and joining together again, an Abbatisse lends the Priest a Violl to
put the Blood in, which the third day after appeared to be flesh. This Flesh is
still reserved in a Cristall glass in the Church of Saint Ambrose in Florence:
and although the outward forms thereof be somewhat dark, yet are they to be
seen of all Trau^llers. So he.

8. Anno 1239. Bezi^s quosupra.
In the Kingdom of Valentia [Vere memorabile] a thing truly memorable; In the
time of the wars between the Christians and Mah^metans there was seen of
the Priest in the Altar pieces of the Host enclosed in linen, and sprinkled
with drops of blood, which Host afterward by advise was laid, with all
reverence, on the back of a Mule to be carried to that place, wheresoever the
Mule should make a stand. The Mule (although enticed often by Provande^ to
stand elsewhere) never made stay until he came to an Hospital of Dorchara,
where falling down upon his knees (least he might afterward carry any thing
less noble, and worthy then that Host) protenus expiravit] he suddenly died.

9. Bozius ibid. ex Viliano, etc.
Anno 1258. When the Priest celebrated the Mass in the Kings Chapel at
Paris, and was now in elevating the Host, to show it unto the people, many of
them presently saw [formosissimum puerum] a most beautiful Child; And out of
the Eucharist [sanguis copiosusemanavit] much blood issued out; so that this
cannot be imputed to the Art of the Devil.

10. Anno 1261. Bozius ibid. and Onuphrius in vita Vrbani Quarti. Vivus sanguis
ex hostia manavit, and totam mappa^, quam Corporale vocant, tinxit.
[Illustrissimum illud] The most famous, upon occasion whereof the Feast of
Corpus Christi day was first instituted, which Panvinus mentions in the life
of Pope Urban the Fourth, when there issued out of the Eucharist [sanguis
copiosus] Abundance of Blood. So that it cannot be attributed to the cunning of
the Devil.

11. Anno 1273. Bozius ibid.
A Miracle was seen at Picenum, where a woman reserved the Eucharist, which
she should have eaten, and kept it with purpose to abuse it for recovering the
love of her Husband by Magic; The Host she laid on Coals, and it presently
turned into flesh: She was astonished, but concealed it by the space of seven
years, at length she discovers it to a Priest, he found this flesh being hid
so long in a Dunghill [intactam, and illaesam] perfect, and entire: he
published this Miracle, which moved infinite numbers to come and see it. And
even now, after, it does yet incite men to come and visit it, for the flesh is
seen after so many years incorrupt, to the eternal memory thereof.

12. Anno 1510. Bozius ibid.
At Knobloch, a Village under the Marquisate of Brandenburgh, one Paulus
Formosus on a night stole the Pix wherein the Eucharist was reserved, he sold
it to a Jew, The Jew pierced it through with a Dagger, and blood flowed out,
etc. Most of all these are related by Master Master Brerely in his Book of the
Liturgy of the Mass, page 188. and 399.
Brerely Priest; whereupon he makes this Conclusion: Miracles showed by God
(says he) do forceably confirm the same, for at breaking of the Host at
sundry times great copy and abundance of blood issued out, as has been
formerly testified. So they.

It were pity, when as so many Countries have been graced with such
Miracles, England should be thought unworthy of like honor; nay here also we
hear there was (Anno 950.) at Canterbury Master Fox Acts and Monuments, page
1115. ex Osberno, in vita Odonis.
a Miracle wrought for confirming diverse Clergy men (then wavering) in the
Doctrine of Transubstantiation, by a Bloody dropping of the Host at Mass.

That these were not Apparitions of true Flesh, and true Blood of Christ, by
the judgment of Romish Schoolmen.

SECT. III.
YOur Bellarmine, Baronius, Bozius, Mr. Breerly, and Coccius have, for proof
of the Corporal presence of Christ, insisted upon Apparitions of (as they have
said) true flesh, red flesh, perfect flesh of the Infant Jesus; and the child
Jesus seen, embraced, and kissed in the Eucharist: of wine turned into Blood,
of Drops of Blood, sprinkling drops of Blood, issuing out, and bloodying
the fingers of the Priest, that saw it. But we rather believe your Schoolmen,
of whom (besides many Revera videri Christum in specie pueri, aut carnis
opinantur, sed cum dubitatione, Alensis, Gabriel, Palacius, Suarez. Ies. Tom.
3. Disp. 55.. 2. pa. 710.
that doubted) diverse, together with Thomas Aquinas, with the Thomists, and
other Authors, alleged by your Jesuit, Suarez, denied all this, saying
Dicendum est in huiusmodi apparitione non videri Christum in se: ita Thomas and
omnes Thomistae. Suarez. ibid. Quando apparet talis speci^s, quidam dicunt,
quod est propria species Christi corporis, nec obstare dicunt, quod aliqua
tantum pa^s carnis, aut quod species pueri appareat, quia potest Christus in
qua vult specie apparere in propria sive aliena: sed hoc est inconveniens, quia
species Christi non potest in propria specie videri, nisi in uno loco, in quo
definitive continetur: unde videatur in propria specie in coelis, non videtur
in hoc Sacramento. Legitur quandoque multorum Episcoporum Concilio in pixide
reservatum, quod nefas est de Christo in propria specie sentire. Aquinas. par.
3. qu 76. art. 8. Quis facile credat, quando visus est sanguis ab hostia
sluere, illud esse sanguinem Christi? vel quando Calix visus est repleri
Christi sanguine, ibi esse Christi sanguinem extra venas corporis, ita vt
tangi, aut bibi possit? Et simile est, quando appareat quasi frustum Carnis,
quod illa fit vera Christi caro: nam per sese apparent indecentia, sive multo,
sive parvo tempore duret. Et nulla est necessitas tot multiplicandi miracula.
Experientia docet mutari, and tabescere id quod videbatur caro, and sanguis,
quod non potest ulla ratione carni Christi attribui. Dicendum est id, quod in
huiu^m^di Apparitionibus videtur, non solum non esse ca^nem and sanguinem
Christi, sed non esse verum sanguinem, ^ut veram carnem, sed color tantum, and
figura. Suarez Jesuit. quo supra. And the Jesuit Sillivitius Senensis, Moral.
quaest. Tom. 1. Tract. 4. cap. 4. and 5. Number. 142. and 101. In istis
apparitionibus non videtur caro and sanguis in se, sed tan^um figura and color
illam referens.
That in such Apparitions there is no True flesh, nor true blood of Christ at
all. Their Reasons; First, Because Christ (say they) cannot appear in his own
proper form in two places at once. Secondly, Because it were heinous
wickedness to enclose Christ in a Box, appearing in his own form. Thirdly,
Because Christ's Blood to issue, and sprinkle out of his veins, who can easily
believe? Fourthly, Because it were undecencie to reserve such Relics,
experience teaching that they do putrify. Thus your own Schoolmen
produced, and approved by Suarez the Jesuit, whose Conclusion and Resolution
is, that The flesh thus appearing is not only not the flesh of Christ, but
even no true flesh at all, but only a color, and Sign thereof. So they. Do
you not then see the different faith of your own Historians, and of your own
Divines? namely that those Historians as unclean beasts swallow down at the
first whatsoever comes into their Mawes; but those your Divines, like more
clean creatures, do ruminate and distinguish truth from falsehood, by sound
reason and judgment, and prove the Authors of such Apparitions flat liars; the
Reporters uncredible Writers; and the Believers of them stark Fools.

That the Romish Answer, to free their former pretended Miraculous Apparitions
from suspicion of Figments, or Illusions, is Insufficient.

SECT. IV.
ALbeit in these Apparitions there be not true flesh (say Quamvis non fiat ^t
vera ca^o Christi, vel revera vera car^ (ut respondent Thomistae) sed tantum
color, and figura cius, tamen quod sit ext^ema species, sive imago divinitus
facta, sufficiens est ad confirmationem veritatis. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp.
55. Sect. 2.
some of your Doctors) yet such Apparitions, being miraculously wrought, are
sufficient Demonstrations that Christ's Flesh is in the Eucharist. But why
should not we yield more credit to those Schoolmen? who say Alens. Gabriel,
Palacius dicunt quod miracula fiunt veris, and non apparentibus signis and
figuris -- Asserunt talem apparitionem non esse factam virtute Dei, sed
Daemonis. Suarez. Ibid. [Where he adds; Hoc ab ijs gratis dictum est.]
True miracles use to be made in true signs, and not in such as seem only so
to be; because seeming signs are wrought by the Art of the Devil. And we take
it from the Assurance, which your Jesuit gives us, that Potest Demon
repraesentare figuras quarum libet rerum, ut argenti, auri, ^pularum,
quemadmodum peritissimi Sculptores and Pictores varias formas, and figuras
rerum ita fingunt, ut interdum vere esse videantur. Sed vere and proprie
miraculum id dicitur opus, quod omnis naturae creatae vim atque potentiam
excedit. Et una differentia, qua vera miracula possunt a falsis discerni, haec
est, quod falsa sunt phantastica, and simulata, ideoque non diuturna: vel sunt
plane inutitila. Perer. Ies in Ex^. 7. Disp. 4. Number. 34. and D. 5. N. 36, 38.
Tertia ratio sumi potest ad confirmandam veritatem Corporis, ex dignitate
personae corpus assumentis: quae cum sit veritas, non decuit ut in eius opere
aliqua fictio insit. Aquin. part. 3. qu. 5 Art. 2.
Devils and Painters can make such semblances and Similitudes: and that true
Miracles are to be discerned from false, in that false Miracles carry only a
likeness of things, and are unprofitable. Furthermore, your P Aquinas proves
against the Heretics, from Sense, that Christ had a true Body, Because it
could not agree with the dignity of his person, who is Truth, that there should
be any fiction in any work of his. Thus stand you still confuted by your own
domestical witnesses.

We may add this Reason, why there could be no Resemblances of Truth, because
all the personal Apparitions are said to be of an Infant, and of the Child
Jesus; albeit Christ, at his ascension out of this world Baron. Ann. 34.
was 34. years of age: and yet now behold Christ an Infant 34. years old! as
if your (...) had beheld Christ, with the Magi, in Bethlehem, at the time of
his birth; and not in Bethaven, with his Disciples, at the instant of his
Ascension.

Of the Suggesters of such Apparitions; and of their Accomplices.

SECT. V.
THe first Apparition of flesh abovementioned was not before the days of the
Emperor Arcadius, which was about the year 395. The second not until 700.
years after Christ; nor is it read of any like Apparition in all the days of
Antiquity, within the compass of so long a time; excepting that of one Marcus,
recorded by Irenaeus adversus Haereses. lib. 1. ca. 9. Marcus purpureum and
rubicundum apparere facit, ut putaretur ea gratia sanguinem stillare in Calicem
per invocationem.
Irenaeus, who feigned to Make the mixed wine in the Cup, through his
Invocation to seem redd, that it might be thought, that grace had infused
Blood into the Cup: which the same Father notes to have been done by Magic;
at what time there were daily Proselytes and new Converts to the Christian
Religion, and on the other side diverse Ranks of Heretics, as namely
Valentinians, Manichees, Marcionites, and others, who all denied, that Christ
had any corporal, or Bodily Substance at all. Were it not then a strange thing
that so many Apparitions should be had in aftertimes, in Churches established
in Christian Religion, and no such one heard of in these days of Antiquity,
when there seemed to be a far more necessary use of them, both for confirming
Proselytes in the faith, and reducing Heretics from their Error? (that
Apparition only of Marcus excepted, which the Church of Christ did impute to
the Diabolical Art of Magic.)

As for the Reporters, much need not to be said of them: Simon Metaphrastes is
the first, who was of that small Credit with your Cardinal that, in Answer to
an Objection from the same Author, he said; Bellar. lib. 2. de Pont. cap. 5..
Neque. And Baronius: Si qua fides adhibenda est Metaphrasti, qui nullam hic
meretur fidem. Ann. 44. number. 38.
I am not much moved with what Metaphrastes says. And if the Foreman of the
inquest be of no better esteem, what shall one then think of the whole Pack?
As for the testimony under the name of Amphilochius (objected by your Coccius
Thesaur. Cath. de Eucharistia.
Coccius) writing the life of Basil, and mentioning the like Apparitions of
Flesh, we make no more account of it, then do your two Sed haud dubio falsa,
vel supposititia. Lib. de Script. Eccles. Tit. Amphilochius; and Card. Baron.
ad Ann. 378. Number. 10.
Cardinals, by whom it is rejected as Supposititious and Bastardly. But the
Suggesters of these Apparitions, what were they? (a matter observable)
ordinarily Priests, together with either old men, weomen, and sometimes young
Girls, who (wheresoever superstition reigns) are known to be most prone
thereunto. That we say nothing of the lewd Iugglings of your Pri^sts, who in
other kinds have been often discovered amongst us, and in other Countries.

We conclude. A true Miracle, for Confirmation of Religion (we are sure) is
Divinum opus, the Infidel Magicians being enforced to confess as much,
saying, Exodus 8. 19.
Digitus Dei hic est. And as sure are we that a fained miracle (although it be
in behalf of Religion) is impious and blasphemous against God, who being the
God of Truth, neither will, nor can be glorified by a lie: Job. 13. 7.
Has God need of a Lie? (says holy Job.) We right willingly acknowledge,
that diverse Miracles have been wrought, for verifying the Eucharist to be a
Divine Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ: but to be it self the true
and substantial flesh of Christ, not one. When a Socrat. Hist. lib. 7. c. 17.
Jew, that had been once Baptized by one Bishop, betook himself to another
Bishop, to be again Baptized of him, in hope of profi^, The Water in the Font
presently vanished away. Aug. de Civit. lib. 22. cap. 8. Medicum podag^icum non
solum dolor, quo ultra solitum cruciabatur: veru^etiam podagra caruisse, nec
amplius quamdiu vixisset pedes doluisse.
S. Augustine tells of a Physician, who was vexed extremely with the Gout,
and at his Baptism was freed from all pain, and so continued all his life
long. Baron. Ann. 984. Number. 19.
Baronius reports another of a Child fallen into a little well, prepared for
men of age to be Baptized in, and after that it was held for drowned, in the
opinion of all bystanders, at the prayer of Damascus it arose from the bottom
as whole and sound as it was before. These Miracles happened not for the
dignifying of the matter, which was the water of Baptism, but of the nature of
the Sacrament it self, albeit void of the Corporal presence of Christ. Not to
tell you (which your Tanta fuit Evangelii authoritas, ut etiam codices ipsi
miracula ediderint: ut Greg. Turonensis in vita Patrum narrat de S. Gallo, qui
Evangeliorum codice accepto civitatis incendium restinxit: ut and S. Martinus,
Ecclesia S. Anastasiae slagrante, test Nicephoro, li. 5. cap. 22. Durant. de
Ritib. lib. 2. c. 23. Number. 22.
Durantus will have you to know) of Miracles, wrought by the Book of the
Gospel, for the extinguishing of Fires. This first Obstacle being removed out
of the way, our passage will be so much the more easier in the following
Discourse.

CHAP. III.
That the Romish manner of the Corporal Presence of Christ, in the Sacrament,
is manifoldly Impossible.

SECT. I.
NO sooner do you hear Protestants talk of the Impossibility of your manner
of Presence, which your Church prescribes, but you presently cry out upon
them, as upon Blasphemous Detractors from the Omnipotency of God, as if they
meant Absit ut fidelis quispiam aurem acco^modet impijs Sacramentarijs, qui
excoecata mente omnipotentiam Christi in hoc Sacramento vel comprehendere
detrectant: quod tanquam pestem lethalem vitare, and intellectum nostrum in
obsequium Christi captivare debemus. Theologi Colon in Provinc. Conc. Tract. de
Sacram. Euch. fol. 92.
To tie God to the Rules of Nature, as your Authors are pleased to suggest. We
hold it necessary therefore to remove this scandal, thus cast in the way for
simple people to stumble upon, before we can conveniently proceed to the maine
matter; and this we shall endeavor to do by certain Propositions.

That, by the Judgment of ancient Fathers, some things (by reason of
Contradiction in them) may be called Impossible, without the impeachment of the
Omnipotency of God; yea, with th great advancement thereof.

SECT. II.
THis Proposition accords to the Judgment of Ancient Fathers, showing that
Aug. de Civit. l. 5. c. 10. Dicitur Deus omnipotens faciendo quod vult, non
faciendo quod non vult: quod si accideret, nequaquam esset omnipotens: unde
propterea quaedam non potest, quia est omnipotens: non potest mori, non
peccare, non falli. Ambros. lib. 6. Epist. 37. ad Chromat. Non posse mori, non
infirmitatis est, sed virtutis. Chrysostom. in Ioh. Nihil impotentius quam hoc
posse. Add hereunto Theod. Dial 3. c. 4. Impossibilia sunt omnipotenti Deo,
(...): Sic posse, esse (...). Nazianz. Orat. 36. (...): vel, (...).
God cannot do something, even because he is omnipotent, as not die, not
sin, not lie, because such Acts proceed not from power, but from impotencie,
and infirmity. So the Fathers.

It is not long since you have been taught by an exceeding worthy Scholar,
that in such Cases as imply Contradiction the ancient Fathers noted the
pretense of Gods omnipotency to have been anciently Casaub. Exercit. 3^ ad
Baron. An. 91. Number. 91. Scitum est piorum Patrum, Omnipotentiam esse Asylum
Haereticorum, quo se recipiant, ubi rationibus fuerint victi. Greg. Nazianz.
Orat. 51. (...). Sic Ariani ab Orthodoxis convicti, Christum Deum non esse
(...), eo confugiebant, ut docerent per omnipotentiam Dei hoc esse factum: qui
error confutatur ab Augustino, qu. 79. Vct. and novi Test. Potentia (inquiunt)
Dei haec est, ut falsa sint vera: mendacis est, ut falsum dicat verum, quod Deo
non competit.
The Sanctuary of Heretics. And they give an instance in the Arrians, who
denying Christ to have been God eternal, believed him to have been created
God in time; as if it were possible there should be a made God, whose property
is to be eternal. Their only pretense was Gods Omnipotency, to make false
things true: wherein they proved themselves the greatest Liars. Take unto you a
second Proposition.

II. That the Doctrine of the same Impossibility (by reason of Contradiction)
does magnify the power of God, by the universal consent of Romish Doctors;
and their diverse examples of Impossibility, concerning a Body.

SECT. III.
YOur own Jesuits do lay this for a ground: Dicendu^, Deum omnia posse
facere, quae ullo modo fiant. Omnes Theologi dicunt, Deum esse omnipotentem,
quia potest id omne, quod no^ implicat contradictionem, quae ponit esse and non
esse simul: and proinde si illud fieret, fieret aliquid, cuius esse esset non
esse, etc. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 2. Alio igitur. Idem. Adversarij
convenient in hoc, id non posse fieri, quod implicat contradictionem. Ibid.
Ipsa contradictio co^sistit in esse, and non esse. Si Deus haberet esse
coniunctum cum non esse, non esset Deus: Si non esset Deus, non esset
Omnipotens. Quare posse facere quod implica^ contradictionem, est Deum posse
non esse omnipotentem. Maldon. Ies. Tom. 1. de Euch. qu. 1. p. 153. and Perer.
Ies. in Genesis 17 initio.
All Divines affirm (say they) that God is omnipotent, because he can do any
thing that implies not contradiction; for that Contradiction both affirms
and denies the same thing, making it to be, and not to be that it is. But God,
who is Being in himself, cannot make a thing jointly to be and not to be. This
is a Contradiction, and were not Omnipotency but Impotencie; not an effect,
but a defect. To conclude. Every thing either is, or is not: take away this
Principle (say you) and farewell all learning and knowledge. So you, and that,
without contradiction, most truly.

As your Doctors have taught the truth in Thesi, and Doctrine, so will they
manifest the same in Hypothesi, by examples of Impossibilities, because of
Contradiction: namely, that it is I. Impossible est Deum posse contineri in
aliquo loco. Greg. de Valent. Ies. II. Fieri non potest divina virtute, ut
spiritus existat more corporum divisibiliter. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. cap.
14.. Respondeo ad. III. Non potest corpus praedicari de pane, quia ita
disparatum affirmarctur de disparato; quod implicat contradictionem. Bell. quo
supra. IV. Impossible, idem esse praesens duobus temporibus simul, cum tempora
fluunt. Bell. Ib. V. Rem eandem produci bis, aut ter in diversis locis non habet
duo substantialia, nec substantialiter diversa: proinde non potest to^ novis
productionibus produci. Vasq. Ies. in 1. Thom. To. 2. disp. 76. c. 6. VI.
Impossible est per divinam potentiam quantitati, ut corpus quantum non
sitaptum occupare locum. Suarez Ies. To 3. disp. 48.. 1 p. 583. VII. Fieri non
potest, quod corpus Christi, ut sit in Sacramento, ex uno in alium locum
venerit, ita enim fieret, ut a coelo fidelibus abesset, quoniam nihil movetur,
nisi locum deserat e quo movetur. Catechis. Romans de Euch. nu. 31. p. 187. VIII.
Dicere Deum facta infecta reddere, quis non videt idem esse, ac dicere Deum
posse facere, ut quae vera, non sint vera. Salmeron. Ies. in 2. Tim. 2. Disp. 3.
Impossible for God to be contained in one place: Secondly, for a Spirit to be
divided into parts: Thirdly, for Bread to be the Body of Christ, at the same
instant when it is Bread: Fourthly, for the same thing to be present together
at diverse times: Fifthly, for one thing to be twice produced in diverse places at
once: Sixthly, for a Body, having quantity, not to be able to possess a place:
Seaventhly, It is impossible for Christ his Body, as it is in the Sacrament, to
come from one place into another: Eighthly, Impossible it is to undo that
which is once done; because this were to make that which is true to be false.
So your Jesuits, with others.

III. That the Doctrine of Calvin (who is most traduced in this point)
accords to the former Judgment of ancient Fathers.

SECT. IV.
IT is no new Calumny, which you have against Calvin, as if he had impugned the
Omnipotency of God, in this Question of the Sacrament; which Calvin himself
did refute in his lifetime, professing, that he is far from subiecting the
power of God to man's reason, or to the order of nature; and believing, that
even in this Sacrament it exceeds all natural principles, that Christ does
feed men's souls with his Blood. But his only exception is against them, who
will impose upon God a power of Contradiction, which is no better than
infirmity it self. Calumniatur (Westphalus) a Nobis in dubium vocari Dei
omnipotentiam -- at rerum omnium conversionem fieri posse a Christo, nos quoque
fatemur; verum inde si quis coelum conversum esse in terram colligat, ridiculus
erit veritatis aestimator. Calv. in Admonit. ad Westphal. -- Rursus. Nos ita
addictos rationi humanae esse iactant, ut nihilo plus tribuamus Dei potentiae
quam naturae ordo patitur, and dictat communis sensus. A tam improbis Calumnijs
provoco ad Doctrinam ipsam, quam tradidi, quae satis dilucide ostendit hoc
mysterium minime rationis modo metiri, nec naturae legibus subijci; obsecro an
ex Physicis didicimus Christum perinde animas nostras ex coelo pascere carne
sua, quod naturaliter non fieri omnes dicunt? Dicent; doctrina nostra fidei
alis superato mundo transcendit coelos. Cur (inquiunt) non faciat Deus, ut
corpus idem plura, and diversa loca occupet, ut nullo loco contineatur* Insane,
quid a Deo postulas, ut carnem faciat non carnem? perinde, ac si instes, ut
lucem faciat tenebras -- Convertet quidem quando volet lucem in tenebras, and
tenebras in lucem, sed quod exigis ut lux tenebrae sint, and non differant quid
aliud quam ordinem Sapientiae pervertis? and eadem est carnis conditio, ut in
uno certo laco sit, and sua dimensione constet. Calv. Instit. l. 4. c. 17.. 24.
item Beza adversus Hess^usium.
We (says he) are not so addicted to natural reason, as to attribute
nothing to the power of God, which exceeds the order of nature, for we
confess that our souls are fed with the flesh of Christ spiritually above all
Physical or natural understanding: but that one should be in diverse places at
once, and not contained in any, is no less absurdity then to call light
darkness. God indeed can when he will turn light into darkness; but to say
light is darkness, is a perverting of the order of Gods wisdom. So Calvin,
and Beza accordingly with him.

And so say we, that it is possible for Christ, (as God) if he were so pleased,
to make of Bread an humane body as easily as of stones to raise up Children to
Abraham; for there is involved no Contradiction in this. But to make Bread to
be flesh, while it is Bread, is a Contradiction in it self, and as much as to
say Bread is no Bread; and therefore to the honor of the Omnipotency of
Christ, we judge this saying properly taken to be Impossible.

CHAP. IV.
That the Romish Doctrine of the Corporal Presence of Christ in the Sacrament
does, against that which Christ called [CORPVS MEVM, MY BODY] imply six
Contradictions.

The first Romish Contradiction, in making it Borne, and not borne of a Virgin.

SECT. I.
THe Catholic Faith has always taught, concerning the Body of Christ, That
it was borne of the Virgin Mary: Secondly, that this, so borne, was, and is but
One: Thirdly, that this one is Finite: Fourthly, that this finite is
Organicall, and consisting of distinct parts: Fifthly, that this Organicall is
now Perfect, and endued with all Absoluteness, that ever any humane body can
be capable of. Sixthly, that this Perfect is now also Glorious, and no more
subject to vilification, or indignity here on earth. But your now Romish
Doctrine, touching Corporal Presence in this Sacrament, does imply
Contradictions, touching each of these, as now we are to manifest, beginning at
the first.

Our Apostolical Article, concerning the Body of Christ, is expressly this; He
was borne of the Virgin Mary: which is the ancientest Article of Faith,
concerning Christ, that is read of in the Book of God: The seed of the woman,
etc. Genesis 3. to show that it was by propagation. But your Roman Article, of
bringing the Body of Christ into this Sacrament, is, that The substance of
Bread is changed into the substance of Christ's Body, which infers a Body
made of the substance of Bread, as we have already See above Book 3. Chap. 3..
2. C. 2.
proved, and as all substantial Conversions do show, whether they be
natural, or miraculous. When the substance of Air is naturally changed into
the substance of Water, this water is made of Air: when the substance of Water
was miraculously changed into Wine, the substance of the Wine was produced out
of the substance of water: when the Body of Lots Wife was turned into a pillar
of salt, the substance of that salt was made of the substance of her Bodily
flesh.

CHALLENGE.
Do you then believe your Doctrine of Transubstantiation, that it is the
substantial Change (by the operative words of Consecration) of Bread into a
Body which you call the Body of Christ? then is this Body not borne, but made;
nor by Propagation from the Blessed Virgin, but by Production, and
Transubstantiation from Bread: which differences, Borne of the Virgin Mary, and
not borne of the Virgin Mary, are plainly contradictory. which was the cause
that Augustine (as Bertram. de corpore Domini, page 61. Ponamusunum testimonium
Augustini, quod dictorum fidem nostrorum ponat, in fermone ad populu^: potest
(inquit) animo cuiuspiam cogitatio talis oboriri, Dominus noste^ Jesus Christus
accepit carnem de Virgin Maria, lactatus est Infans, etc. Quomodo panis corpus
eius, and calix sanguis? Is^a, fratres, ideo dicuntur Sacramenta, quiain eis
aliud videtur, aliud intelligitur: quod videtur, speciem habet corporalem, quod
intelligitur, fructum habet spiritualem. Ista venerabilis Author dicens,
inst^uit nos quid de proprio Domini Corpore, quod de Maria n^tum est, -- and
nunc sedet ad dextram Patris, and quid de isto, quod supra Altar ponirur
sentire debemus: Illud integrum est, neque ulla sectione dividitur, Hoc autem
figura, quia Sacramentum.
Bertram shows) distinguished between the Body borne of the Virgin, and that
which is on the Altar, as between Aliud, and Aliud; one, and another thing.
And this Argument has been fortified Lib. 3. Chap. 3.. 2.
before, and is furthermore confirmed by Saint Augustine Lib. 4. Chap. 7.. 6.
afterward.

The second Romish Contradiction, to the overthrowing of that, which Christ
called [MY BODY:] by making one Body of Christ, not one, but many.

SECT. II.
YOur Profession stands thus: Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3.
The Body of Christ, albeit now in Heaven, yet is (say you) substantially in
many places here on earth, even wheresoever the Host is consecrated. So you.
Next your Master M. Brerely in his Book of the Liturgy of the Mass, page 150.
Because Calvin. Instit. 4. cap. 17.. 10. says: Etsi incredibile videtur, ut in
tanta locorum distantia penetrare ad nos possit Christi caro, ut sit nobis in
cibum, etc.
Brerely labors earnestly to draw Calvin to profess a Possibility of
Christ's Bodily presence in diverse places at once, contrary to Master Caluins
plain and express profession in the same Chapter; where he directly confuteth
this Romish Doctrine of Madness, saying thus: The same Calvin in the same
Chap. 17.. 24. Cur (inquiunt) non faciat Deus ut caro eadem diversa loca
occupet, ut nullo loco contineatur, ut modo, and specie careat? Insane, quid a
Deo postulas ut carnem simul faciat esse, and non carnem? perinde ac si instes,
ut lucem simul lucem faciat, ac tenebras. Ibidem. 26. Corpus Christi, ex quo
resurrexit, non Aristoteles, sed Spiritus sanctu^ finitum esse tradit, and
coelo contineri usque ad ultimum diem. Et. 30. Cuius ^rgo amentiae est, coelum
terrae potius miscere, quam non extrahere Christi corpus e coelestisanctuario?
To seek, that Christ his Body should be in many places at once, is no less
madness than to require, that God should make his body to be flesh, and not to
be flesh at one time; whereas not Aristotle, but the Spirit of God (says he)
has taught us, that this his body is to be contained in Heaven until the last
day. Afterward Calvin inveigheth against the folly of your Church, which will
not acknowledge any presence of Christ in this Sacrament, except it be local
on earth, As if (says he) she would pull Christ out of his Sanctuary of
Heaven. And at last, after that he had said, As for the objected sentence, he
explicateth himself,. 31. Christus illis praesens non est, nisi ad nos
descendat, quasi v^ro si nos ad se evehat, non aeque eius potiamur praesentia.
and. 36. ut Christum illi^ rite apprehe^da^t, piae animae in coelum erigantur
necesse ^st. [As untruly also does he allege Bucer, Beza, and Farel p. 237.
who had the same sense with Calvin. Master Fox said that Christ if he list
might be on earth, but he said not so of and in the same time.]
Christ his Body is united to the soul of the Communicant, he so explaineth
himself, that he meant a spiritual Union: so that it does fully appear,
that Master Brerely in this point (as usually in many others) alleges Calvin's
testimony, against Calvin's sense; and his own conscience.

It is irksome to see the fury, wherewith your Disputers are carried against
Protestants, amongst whom we see again your Master See in the former
Allegation.
Brerely imposing upon Beza the same opinion of the presence of Christ's Body
in Heaven, and in Earth at one time. Although, notwithstanding, Fieri posse, ut
Christi corpus possit esse in pluribus locis simul, praeter hunc A postatam
nemoinficiatus est, quod cum ^redere noluit, tollit ab omnipotenti virtute.
Salmer. Ies. tom. 9. tract. 23. page 173.
your Jesuit Salmeron as bitterly taxes Beza, for contrarily holding it
Impossible for one Body to be in two places at once; whom therefore he calls
an Apostata: and whom Beza cum adversarijs congressus, ubi Calvini mysteria non
posse^ defendere, in eam prorupit Blasphemiam, ut Deum neget omnipotentem:
diserte enim scribit, Deum non posse efficere, ut Corpus aliquod, manente
substantia, sit absque ^oco, vel in pluribus locis simul; Illud enim Angeli
axioma [apud Deum nihil est impossibile] non sine exception^ accipiendum esse,
quod factum fieri nequit infectum -- O argutos Philosophos! qui Dei Maiestatem
ad suas physicas regulas non erub^scunt revocare Prateol. Elench. Haeres. lib
2. Tit. Bezanitae.
another terms for the same cause, Blasphemous, as if this were indeed to
deny the Omnipotency of God. Whereas, according to our former Proposition, it
is rather to defend it, because God is the God of Truth (which is but one) and
Truth is without that Contradiction, which is necessarily employed in your
Doctrine of the Local presence of any one Body in many places at once, as in
the next place is to be evinced.

That the same Second Romish Contradiction, holding the Presence of one Body in
many places at once, is proved, by the nature of Being in distinct places at
one time, to be a making One, not One.

SECT. III.
IN the first place hearken to your Aquinas, (the chiefest Doctor, that ever
professed in the Romish School) Catholiciisti cu^ Thoma in quartum distinct.
14. art. 2. ha^c rationem, cur non possit corpus Christi localiter esse, etc.
-- Quod si vero non possit corpus Christi localiter esse in diversis locis,
quia divideretur a seipso, profecto nec possit Sacramentaliter esse eadem
ratione: qui licet dicat hoc non esse per l^ci occupationem, tamen dicit, per
realem and veram praesentiam in pluribus Hostijs, sive Altaribus: quae realis
praesentia in ^ot Altaribus, and non locis intermedijs, non minus tollere
videretur indivisionem r^i. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. page 491. Quidam
Catholici, atque in cis Sanctus Thomas existimant non posse unum corpus esse
simul in diversis locis localiter; quia (inquiunt) unum est illud, quod
indivisum in se est, and divisum a quocunqu^ alio. ^ellar. quo supra.
It is not possible by any Miracle, that the Body of Christ be locally in many
places at once, because it includes a Contradiction, by making it not one; for
one is that, which is not divided from it self. So he, together with others
whom you call Catholics, who conclude it Impossible for the Body of Christ to
be corporally in diverse places at once. Which although he speak concerning the
local manner of being; yet his Reason (as See the former testimony.
your Cardinal confesses) does as well concern your Sacramental manner of
being on earth. And Aquinas his reason being this, [Vnum] One (says he) is
that, which is not divided from it self: but, to be in diverse places at once,
does divide one from it self, and consequently makes it not to be One: which
being a Contradiction, does infer an Impossibility. So he* Earnestly have we
sought for some Answer to this insoluble Argument, as we think: And your
greatest Doctor has nothing to say, but that the Duplex est divisio, una
intrinseca, in se, altera extrinseca, and accidentalis in respectu ^oci. Itaque
cum corpus est in diversis locis, non tollitur indivisio in se, sed extrinseca,
in respectu ^oci, ut ^um Deus sit unus, est in diversis ^ocis, and anima
rationalis est in diversis partibus corporis una. Bellar. ibid.
Being in a place is not the essential property of a thing, and therefore can
be no more said to divide the body from it self, then it can be said to divide
God, who is every where, or the soul of man, which is one in every part, or
member of the Body. So he. We throughout this whole Tractate, wherein we
dispute of the existence of a Body in a place, do not tie our selves every
where to the precise Acception of place, as it is defined to be Superficies,
etc. but as it signifies one space or distinct vbi, from another, which we
call here, and there. we return to your Cardinals Answer.

CHALLENGE.
AN answer you have heard from your Cardinal, unworthy any man of Judgment,
because of a Triple falsity therein. First in the Antecedent, and Assertion,
saying that Being in a place or space is not inseparable from a Body. Secondly
in the ground of that, because Place is not of the essence of a Body. Thirdly
in his Instances, which he insisteth upon (for example sake) which are both
Heterogenies. Contrary to this Assertion, we have already proved the necessity
of the local being of a Body, wheresoever it is; and now we confirm it, by
the Assertion of One, then whom the latter Age of the World has not
acknowledged any more accurate, and accomplished with Philosophical learning;
even Si dicas, corpus est hic, and ibi idem, ipsum quidem distrahas in diversa:
principio primo perse, and immediato prohibetur corpus esse in pluribus ubi:
est autem continui^as affectus co^seque^s immediate unitatem; Contradictiones
enim sunt. Julius Scal. Exercit. 5. qu. 6.
Julius Scaliger by name, who has concluded, as a principle infallible, that
Continuity being an immediate affection, and property of Unity, One body can
not be said to be in two places, as here, and there, without dividing it self
from it self. So he. Certainly, because Place being the Terminus (to wit
that, which does confine the Body that is in it) it is no more possible for the
Body to be in many places at once, than it is for an Unity to be a multitude,
or many. Which truth, if that you should need any further proof, may seem to
be confirmed in this, that your Disputers are driven to so miserable straits,
as that they are not able to instance in any one thing in the world to
exemplify a Possibility of the being of a Body in diverse places at once, but
only Man's soul, which is a spirit; and God himself, the Spirit of Spirits,
of both which See below Chap. 4. 2. and Chap. 5.. 2.
hereafter. Only you are to observe, that the Cardinals Argument, in proving
Space to be separable from a Body, because it is not of the Essence of a Body,
is, in it self, a Non sequitur, as may appear in the Adiunct of Time, which
although it be not of the Essence of any thing, yet is it impossible for any
thing to be without time, or yet to be in two different times together.

The same second Romish Contradiction manifested in Scripture, by an Argument
Angelical.

SECT. IV.
MAth. 28. 6. The Angel speaking to the woman, that sought Christ in the
grave, said; He is not here, for he is risen, and gone into Galilee: which is
as much, as to have said, he could not be in both places at once; an Argument
Angelical. But you answer that it was spoken Morally. How? (we beseech you)
as if one should say (says your Loquitur ad mentem sanctarum illarum mulierum
-- Sed optima est sol^tio, moraliter intelligi, ut si quis dicat, talis homo
non sede^ ad mensam, coenatus est enim. Bellar. lib. 3^ de Euch. cap. 4.
Cardinal) Such a man sits not at table, for he has supped: what fond
trifling is this, and wilful perverting the Truth of God? for this your
Argument, A man sits not at table, for he has supped, is scarce a probable
Consequence, that a man is risen from the table, as soon as he has supped.
Contrarily, the Angel's Logic is not by a Peradventure, but necessary not
imaginary, but historical; not coniecturall but dogmatiticall, and
demonstrative. For better explanation whereof, we may turn the Causall word
(FOR) into an Illative [THEREFORE,] because it is all one (as you know) to say
he is not here in the Grave [For] he is risen out of the Grave, And to say,
He is risen out of the grave, [Therefore] he is not here in the Grave.
Understand then, first, that the matter subject of this Argument being no
moral arbitrary Act of man's will; but the omnipotent Resurrection of Christ
from the dead, (which is a fundamental Article of Christian Faith, yea, and as
it were the foundation of all other Articles, without which, as the Apostle
says, 1. Cor. 15. 14.
Our Faith were vain) the Angel must necessarily be thought to have concluded
dogmatically; which is the reason that he is so instant, and urgent, saying to
the woman, Come, and see the place, where the Lord was laid. Which he adds
(says your Videlz. Ad comprobandum dictum [Non est hic.] Salmer. Jes. Tom. 11.
tract. 9. page 72.
Jesuit) for confirmation of that, which he had said, [He is not here.] And
as much as if he had said (says Anselme) Quasi dicat, si verbo non credatis,
vacuo sepulchro cr^datis. Anselm.
If you believe not my word, give credit to the empty Sepulcher, in satisfying
your own sight. Therefore was it demonstrative. And again, the Angel putting
them to make use both of his ^aying, and their own seeing; Go ye (says he)
and tell his Disciples: And they went (says the Text) to bring his Disciples
word. Therefore was his Argument Doctrinall, such whereby he thought so fully
to persuade them that they might inform others in an Infallible Truth. It were
injury unto you to deprive you of that light which Augustine offers unto you
in commenting upon these words of Christ; Marc. 26. 12.
The Poor you shall have always with you, but me you shall not always have.
The light, which will expel all Romish darkness out of every corner of
exception to the contrary, is, first if you shall say, that Christ did not
speak of his bodily Presence; Aug. tractat. 50. in Ioh. Pauperes habebitis
semper vobiscum, me autem non habebitis] loquebatur de praesentia corporis:
habebitis, secundum providentiam, secundum Maiestatem, and invisibilem gratiam
-- secundum carnem vero, quam verbum assumpsit, secundum id, quod de Virgin
natum est, etc. no^ habebitis. quare quonia^ conversatus est cum Discipulis
quadragin^a diebus aseendit in coelu^, and non est hic.
He spoke (says Augustine) of his bodily presence, in saying, you shall not
have me always with you. Secondly, if you answer, that Christ denied not
absolutely his Corporal presence, but only the manner of his presence on
earth, in his visible shape: Augustine will reform you, showing, that Christ,
in saying You shall not have me; by [Me] meant absolutely his Body, as it is
distinguished from his Godhead, namely, You shall have me, according to my
Majesty, and my providence, and invisible grace (all spiritual:) but according
to my flesh, even that flesh, which was borne of the Virgin Mary [you shall not
have me.] Thirdly, If you reason, saying; But yet is it possible for Christ to
be here on Earth, and there in Heaven at one instant? Augustine will confute
you, who asking, why Christ may not be said to be here in Bodily presence,
gives only this reason, because he ascended into Heaven, and (as alluding to
the former words of the Angel) adds, And he is not here. So raw therefore,
so vain, and perverse is that Answer of Moral, and Civil reasoning, which
your Cardinal obtruded upon his Readers, against an Argument both so
Angelical, and Evangelicall.

That the Romish Objection out of that Scripture, Act. 9. is frivolous.

SECT. V.
CHrist (Acts 9.) appeared to Saint Paul, then Saul, when he was in his way to
Damascus, etc. whence your Cardinal Simul in summo coelo, and in aere vicino
terrae. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3.. Secundum etc.
labors to prove a double presence of Christ, at one instant, (to wit) in
Heaven with the Saints, and in the Air unto Saul. First, because the light in
the Air Struck Saul blind. Secondly, because others in the company of Saul
heard not the same voice of Christ, which he heard. Thirdly, because Saul asked
saying; Lord, who ar^ thou? and heard and understood the voice. Fourthly,
Because Saul was thereby made a witness of seeing Christ risen from the dead.
And therefore (says he) was this Apparition in the Air. Every objection may
receive it is opposition. To the first, thus: Did none of you ever know a man's
eyes so dazzled with the brightness of the Sunbeams on earth, that he could
not see for awhile; and yet did not the Sun remove any whit from his Sphere? So
might the glorious shine of the person of Christ in Heaven work upon Saul on
earth.

To the second, thus. Have you not read of a voice from Heaven, John 12. 29.
which some heard articulately, and said, An Angel speaks, and the common
people said, It thundreth? because (as your Tolet. Ies. in eum locum.
Jesuit confesses) they heard it but confusedly.

To the third, thus: Men hear, and hear not, so far as God is pleased to
reveal, or not to reveal himself, or his word and voice, yea or any sight
unto them; for Saint Stephen saw the Heavens opened, and Majesty of Christ,
when others wanted that sight.

To the fourth, thus: The eyes of Saul beholding Christ in Heaven might be as
good witnesses of Christ his Resurrection, as were the eyes of Saint Stephen,
Acts 7. who saw him; and so much more, because he was both made blind by the
brightness of that sight of Christ, and after healed in the Name of Christ.

If any desire to know the judgment of ancient Fathers, in this Case, your
Cardinal leaves him to seek it where he shall please. Sure we are that Aug.
in Psalm. 54. and Tract. 1. in Ioh. Caput in coelis, cuius membra calcabantur in
terra.
Augustine, Ambros. in 1. Cor. 15. Apparuit ei primo in coelo.
Ambrose, Pope Greg. Moral. Ho^. 34. in Evang. ad finem. Persecutorem de coelo
allocutus.
Gregory the first, and Isid. Pelus. lib. 1. Epist. 409. (...). Et Theophylact.
in in Act. 9. (...), etc.
Isidore Pelusiota do expressly affirm that the appearance of Christ to Saint
Paul was [de Coelo] from Heaven. And if all this were true that has been
objected, that Christ appeared in the Air, yet is your Consequence but lame,
that therefore he was bodily also in Heaven, if we may believe your Jesuit
Lorinus: Potuittantisper de coelo descendisse. Lorin. Ies. in Act. 9.
Because Christ (says he) might for so short a time have descended from
Heaven. By all which you may perceive, that your Cardinal, for all his arguing
about the Air, has been (as the Proverb is) but Beating the Air. And as
lancke and frivolous is his Confirmation of their Assertion by (as he says)
Apparitions of Christ unto diverse here on earth, when as yet he was certainly
in Heaven: for it is not certain, that he appeared personally to any here on
earth, if the position of your Evangelicall Doctor Aquinas may stand for good,
who held it See above Chap. 2 Sect. 3.
Impossible for Christ to appear here on earth, in his proper shape, in two
places at once: which shows that these Apparitions of Christ were rather only
Visions, without any personal appearing. We are not ignorant how much you
attribute to your Cardinal Bellarmine, whom you have heard contending so
urgently for proof of the visible Presence of Christ in diverse places at once;
and what like Esteem you have of your great Professor Suarez, who now comes
concluding as follows. Co^cludo, Christi corpus tantum esse in coelo and in
Eucharistia; seclusoque ^odem Eucharistiae mysterio, non solum non esset corpus
ubique, sed neque etiam esset al^^ubi, nisi in coelo: and contrarium asserere
esse^ magna temeritas fine fundamento, and contra omnes Theologos. Suarez Ies.
Tom. 1. in Thom. quast. 14. Art. 1. Disp. 34.. 4.
The Body of Christ, except it is being in the mystery of the Eucharist, is no
where but only in Heaven: and to affirm the contrary were a great rashness
without ground; and contrary to all Divines. So he. We leave these your two
most eminent Doctors of the Chair, and both of the same Society of the
Jesuits, the one for Rome, the other for Spain, in this their Contradiction,
that we may consult with Antiquity it self.

That the Opinion of the Being of a Body, in many places at once; implies a
Contradiction, is secondly proved by the judgment of Ancient Fathers, thereby
distinguishing Christ his two natures, Godhead and Manhood, one from another,
by Circumscription and Incircumscription.

SECT. VI.
ANcient Fathers judged it Impossible for a Body to be without Determination in
one only place at one time: yea (say you) they did so, but meaning Impossible,
according to the course of nature, but not absolutely Impossible, as if by
Divine Miracle a Body might not be in many places at once. This is your only
Answer, and the Answer of every one of your Answerers, whereat we should
wonder, but that they have given us so often experience, what little conscience
they make, how true their Answers be, so that they may be known to have
answered: otherwise they well know that the Fathers meant an absolute
Impossibility; and that this is most evident by the Heresy which they did
impugn; and also by their manner of confuting the same. The Eutychian
Heretics (you Alf^ns. de Castro c^nt. Haeres. Eutych.
know) confounded the properties of Christ's humane nature with his Godhead,
pretending (as you do) the Omnipotency of Christ, for the patronizing of
their heresy, As thinking thereby (thus says Theod. Dial. 2. Dicunt Christi
carnem spiritualem, and alterius substantiae quam sit nostra caro: ^maginantur
se per haec Deu^ magnifacere, cum tamen falsi veritatem accusant.
Theodoret, out of Amphilochius) To magnify the Lord Christ, whereas this was
indeed (as the same Father says) to accuse God of falsehood. You may hear the
same voice sound out of the Roman Chair. Pope Leo Papa Epist. 13. quae est ad
Pulcher. Aug. Subrepsi^^e in^elligo spiritum falsi^atis, ut dum affirmat se
religiosius de filij Dei maiestate sentire, si ei naturae nostrae veritatem
inesse non dicat, etc.
Leo, speaking of Eutyches, the Author of that heresy, says that He
affirmed, that thereby he did more religiously conceive of the Majesty of
Christ, by denying his humane nature; whom therefore that holy Pope censureth
to have been seduced by the spirit of falsity. Therefore it cannot be but that
the Fathers, in confuting an heresy founded upon a pretense of Omnipotency,
did hold that doctrine absolutely impossible, which they withstood, as will now
more lively appear by the Testimonies of themselves. Theodoret against this
Heretic argues thus: Theod. Dial. 3. l. 3. ex Eusebius. Emis. (Contra eos, qui
dicunt Corpus Christi in Divinitate mutatum esse post resurrectionem.) Hos
di^^re necesse est vel divinae naturae manus and pedes, and alias corporis
parts tributas esse, vel fateri corpus mansisse in suae naturae finibus. Atqui
divina natura simplex est and incomposita, corpus autem compositum and in
multas parts divisum: non est ergo mutatu^ in naturam divinitatis, and quidem
immortale factum, and divina natura plenum; sed tamen corpus, quod propriam
habet Circumscriptionem.
The Body of Christ, being a compounded thing, cannot be changed into a divine
nature, because it has Circumscription. This had been no good reasoning,
except his CANNOT had imported an absolute Impossibility. Vigil. lib. 4. con.
Eutych. Circumscribitur loco per naturam carnis suae, and loco non capitur per
naturam divinitatis suae. Hec fides est confessio Catholica, quam Apostoli
tradidetunt, Martyrs roboraverunt, and fideles nunc usque custodiunt. Et paulo
superius. Quia nunc in coelo est, non est utique in terra.
Vigilius (anciently Bishop of Trent) might have read a Lesson to the late
Bishops at Trent, who against the same Heretic, distinguishing the two
natures of Christ, his humane nature by being Circumscribed in one place; the
divine by being unlocable, doubted not to infer, saying of his Bodily nature:
It being now in heaven is not at all on earth. And, least that any might think
this was but his own private opinion, he averreth saying; This is the
Catholic profession taught by the Apostles, confirmed by Martyrs, and
hitherto held of the faithful. So Fulgentius upon the same distinction makes
the same Conclusion, saying of his Bodily substance, that therefore Fulgent. de
persona Christi, ad Trasmund. l. 2, c. 5. Vnus idemque homo localis ex homine,
qui est Deus immensus ex Patre. Vnus idemque secundum humanam substantiam,
absens coelo, cum esset in terra; and derelinquens terram, cum ascendisset in
Coelum.
Being on Earth it was absent from Heaven; and going to Heaven it left the
Earth. Damascen had to deal with the forenamed Heretic, and professing to
deliver the substantial difference of both natures, he differenceth them by
these contrary Charters, Damascen. de fide Orthodoxa lib. 3. cap. 3. Earum
naturarum, (...) astruimus salvari: nam creatum; mansit creatum; increatum,
increatum: mortale manebat mortale; immortale, immortale: [(...).]
Created, not Created; Capable of mortality, and not capable of mortality;
circumscribed, and not circumscribed; and Invisible in it self, and visible:
which notwithstanding is in the Eucharist, by your doctrine, not Capable of
Circumscription, because whole in the whole host, and in every part thereof,
and to the very Angels of God Invisible.

Let us ascend hither to the more primitive Ages, to inquire of Fathers, who
had conflicts also with Heretics, who gaine-said the Truth of either nature.
Athanasius urged Christ his Ascension into Heaven, to prove that he was truly
man, as God, because his Godhead was never out of Heaven, being Athanas. part.
2. Adversus eos qui nullum non miraculum imminuunt, eo quod carnem negant:
(...).
Vndeterminate in place, and uncircumscribed, even then, when it was
Hypostatically united with the Body, being on earth. Therefore it was his Body
that ascended into Heaven from Earth. His Argument is taken from
Circumscription; even as Nazian. Epist. 1. ad Cledon. Hominem and Deum, (...).
Nazianzene also does Characterize them. Augustine falling upon such
Heretics, as taught a Bodily presence of Christ in the Sun, and in the
Moon, at once, (which you your selves will confess could not be imagined to
be according to the Course of nature) gives them first this Caveat: Aug.
Epist. 57. ad Dardan. [After his Caveat; Cavendum ne ita divinitatem astruamus
hominis, ut corporis veritatem auferamus.] Toll spatium corporibus, and
n^squam erunt, and quia nusquam erunt, non erunt. Et paulopost. Cum carnis
substantijs immortalitatem dedit, naturam non abstulit: Et aliquanto post.
Distantibus spatijs non corpora simul esse possunt. Idem contra Faustum Manich.
lib. 2. cap. 11. Secundum praesentiam spiritualem pati nullo modo Christus
potuit: secundum praesentiam corporalem simul in sole and luna esse non potuit.
You may not (says he) so defend the Deity of Christ, as to defraud the Truth
of his humanity: then he adds (as if none could feign a presence of a Body
without determination in space or place) Bodies cannot be without space. And
again, Ambros. in Luc. 24. Stephanus non super terram te quaesivit, qui te
stantem ad dextram Dei vidit.
A Body cannot be at one time in places distinct one from another. And what
else does that saying of Ambrose imply, spoken as to Christ? Stephen (says he)
who saw thee in Heaven, sought thee not upon earth.

Cyrill of Alexandria is a Father, whose Patronage your Disputers would be
thought often to rely upon; he is now about to deliver his Judgment so freely
and plainly, as if he had meant to stop the mouths of all our Opposites in the
same Answer, which he makes against certain Heretics, who held that God's
nature is a Substance, which can receive division and partition: If God (says
Cyril. Alex. Tom. 2. lib. 2. de Trinit. Si vere Sectionem and partitionem
divina natura (ut illi dicunt) reciperet, and intelligeretur ut corpus: si
autem hoc, and in loco omnino, and quantitate; and si quanta facta esset, non
eff^geret Circumscriptionem. fol. 89.
Cyrill) should be divisible, as a Body, then should it be contained in place,
and then should it have Quantity, and having Quantity it could not but be
Circumscribed. Will you now say (which hitherto has been your only Answer
to other Fathers) that Cyrill meant not that it was absolutely Impossible, that
Quantity should be without Circumscription, but only according to the Course
of nature? then might the Heretics, whom Cyrill confuted, have made the same
Answer, and consequently Cyril's Consequence and confutation had been of no
force. What shall we say? must still the ancient Fathers be made no better
than Asses in arguing, that your Romish Masters (forsooth) may be deemed the
only Doctors, even then, when they prepare the same Evasion for Heretics,
which they devise for themselves? but you must pardon us, if we believe that
Cyrill (seeing he durst say that God himself, if he were a Body, must be in
a place, as a thing having Quantity and Circumscribed) would have abhorred
your now Romish Faith of believing See hereafter, Chapter 3. Sect. 3.
Christ's Body consisting of Quantity, albeit not Circumscribed in place.

CHALLENGE.
THese so many and manifest proofs of the ancient Fathers, concluding an
Impossibility of Existence of a Body without Determination in one place, may be
unto us a full Demonstration that they were Adversaries to your Romish Doctrine
of Corporal Presence, and that all your Objections, out of them, are but so
many forged, and forced Illusions.

We conclude. If Christ himself gave a Caveat, not to believe such Spirits as
should say of his Bodily presence in this world, after his Resurrection; Mat.
24. 23.
Behold here is Christ, and behold there is Christ: then doubtless much less
credit is to be given to your Church, which teaches and professes an Here is
Christ, and a There is Christ, in the same instant; as we shall further more
confirm by like verdict of Antiquity, when we shall hear the Fathers prove
both that See Chap. 5. Sect. 3.
Angels, and all created Spirits are finite Creatures, and not Gods, even
because they are contained in one place: and also that the holy Chap. 6. Sect.
2.
Ghost is God, and no finite Creature, because it is in diverse places at once.
But we must handle our matters in order.

That the Romish Doctors (in their Objections) have no solid proof of the
Existence of one Body in diverse places at once: from the Judgment of
Antiquity.

SECT. VII.
IT is a kind of Morosity, and Perverseness in our Opposites, to object those
testimonies, which have their Answers, as it were tongues in their mouths,
ready to confute their Objections. For Chrysostom. lib. 3. de Sacerdotio; O
miraculum! O Dei benignitatem! qui cum patre ^ursum sedet, and eodem tempore
omnium manibus pertractatur. Obijcit. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 22. not
considering what went before these words, in the same place, where Chrysostom
will not have his hearer believe, that the Priest and People communicating do
not [in terris consistere, sed potius in coelum transferri.] then follows, O
miraculum, etc. -- adest ^n^m Sacerdos non igne^ gestans, sed Spiritum Sanctum.
Chrysostom says not more plainly that Christ, at one and the same time,
sitting with his Father in Heaven, is here handled of Communicants on earth;
than he does say of the Priest and People communicating, that They do not
consist or stay on earth, but are transported into Heaven. And again, a little
after the words objected, The Priest (says he) is here present, not carrying
the fire, but the holy Ghost. These and the like sayings of Chrysostom do
verify the Censure of your See. B. 3. Chapter 4.. 6.
Senensis upon him, that he was most frequent in figurative Amplifications and
Hyperbole's. Another Objection is commonly made out of Chrysostom. ad populum
Antioch: hom. 2. Helisaeus* Melotem accepit (Heliae) erat posthac duplex Elias,
sursum Elias, deorsum Elias. Then applying this to the Sacrament; Helias nempe
melotem Disclpulis suis reliquit: filius autem Dei ascendens nobis carnem
dimisit; sed Elias quidem exutus, Christus autem and ipsam nobis reliquit, and
ipsam ascendens habuit.
Chrysostom, of a double Elias, one above and another below (meaning, by Elias
below, the sheepe-skin, or mantle of Elias, received by Helisaeus,) namely,
that Christ ascending into Heaven, in his own flesh, left the same, but as
Elias did his Mantle, being called the other Elias, to wit, figuratively: so
the Sacrament, a token of Christ's flesh, is called his flesh. Which must needs
be a true Answer, unles you will have Chrysostom to have properly conceited,
as a double Elias; so consequently a double Christ. As for the next Greg.
Nyssen. -- Vnu^ Christi corpus per totum orbem tot fidelium Millibus impertiri,
etc. Alleged by Mr. Breerly, Tract. 2.. 4. Subd. 1. p. 149.
Testimony, it is no more than which every Christian must confess, namely,
that it is the same whole, and undivided Christ, which is spiritually received
of all Christians, wheresoever, and whenever throughout the world: the same
we say Obiectively, although not Subiectively; as the Sixth Book Chap. 6. and.
3. will demonstrate.

That your most plausible Objection taken out of Augustine, concerning Christ
his Carrying himself in his own hands, is but Sophistical.

SECT. VIII.
Aug. Tom. 8. in Psalm. 33. Conc. 1. [Efferebatur in manibus eius] Hoc quomodo
possit fieri^n homine, quis intelligat? manibus alienis portatur quis; suis
autem nemo portatur. Quomodo intelligatur de Davide secundum literam non
invenimus: in Christo autem invenimus, quando commendans ipsum corpus suum,
ait, [Hoc est corpus meum:] fer^bat enem corpus in manibus suis, etc.
AVgustine in expounding the 33. Psalm, and falling upon a Translation, where
the words 1. Sam. 21. are these (by interpretation) He carried himself in his
own hands; says that these words could not be understood of David, or yet of
any other man literally: for [Quomodo fieri potest?] (says he) How could that
be etc. And therefore expounds them as meant of Christ, at what time he said
of the Eucharist, [This is my Body.] This is the testimony which not only
your Obijcit Bell. Vox [Quodammodo] Signi, non propria specie, sed aliena, nee
modo usitato, sed extraordinary: satis est, quod non figurate significatur, L.
2. de Euch cap. 24.
Cardinal, but all other your Disputers, upon this subject, do so
ostentatively embrace, and as it were hug in their arms as a witness, which
may alone stop the mouth of any Protestant; which therefore, above all other,
they dictate to their Novices, and furnish them therewith, as with Armor of
proof against all Opposites, especially seeing the same testimony seems to
be grounded upon Scripture.

Contrarily we complain of the Romish Disputers against this their fastidious
and perverse importunity, in urging a testimony, which they themselves could
as easily have answered as objected; both in taking exception at the ground of
that speech, to show that it is not Scripture at all, and also by moderating
the rigidity of that sentence, even out of Augustine himself.

THE FIRST CHALLENGE,
Showing, that the Ground of that Speech was not Scripture.

PRotestants (you know) allow of no Authentical Scripture of the old
Testament, which is not according to the Original, namely, the Hebrew text;
and the Church of Rome allows of the Vulgar Latin Translation, as of the
only Authentical. But in neither of them are these words, viz. [Hee was
carried in his own hands:] but only that David, now playing the Madman,
slipped, or fell into the hands of others, as your Tostatus Abulensis. [Et
collabebatur inter manus eorum:] Nempe ad modum hominis furiosi ostendebat se,
u^t insanum. Com. in cum locum.
Abulensis truly observes. So easily might the Transcribers of the
Septuagints err, in mistaking (...) for (...): and so impossible it is for you
to ground the objected sentence upon divine Scripture, even in your own
judgment.

THE SECOND CHALLENGE,
Showing, that the Romanists cannot stand to the [QVOMODO] of Augustine.

THis word [Quomodo, How] implying it to be impossible for David, or any other
man to carry himself in his own hands, excepting Christ, as you defend, must
argue either an absolute Impossibility, or not: if it intend an absolute
Impossibility of any man to be carried in his own hands, in a literal sense,
then could not Christ, as man, be carried in his own hands: and if it do not
intimate an absolute Impossibility, then might David or any other man, by the
power of God, have carried himself in his own hands. So that whether thus, or
so, you will make Augustine contradict himself, if his words be taken in the
Preciseness and strictness of that which is a Literal sense.

THE THIRD CHALLENGE,
Showing that Augustine in another word following, to wit, [QVODAMMODO] does
answer Saint Augustine himself to his own formerly objected word [QVOMODO.]

SAint Augustine after he had said Quomodo, How? (a word seeming to signify
an Impossibility) left that it, being taken absolutely, might imply a direct
carrying of himself in his hands at his Supper, he qualifieth that his speech
somewhat after, saying; [Quodammodo, etc.] that is, After a certain manner
Christ carried himself in his own hands. Which is a modification, and indeed a
Correction of the excess of his former sentence. Our next labor must be to
find out the meaning of his [Quodammodo] and what ^his manner of Christ's
carrying himself was, in the judgment of Saint Augustine.

THE FOVRTH CHALLENGE,
Showing Saint Augustine to be an utter enemy to the Romish Cause in all their
other conceited manners, concerning Christ in this Sacrament.

AGainst your manner of interpreting the words of Christ [HOC EST CORPUS MEVM]
properly, you have heard Augustine often pleading for a Figurative sense.
Secondly, against your manner of bringing in the Body of Christ, by
Transubstantiation, he has acknowledged in this Sacrament, after
Consecration, the Continuance of Bread. Thirdly, Against your Corporal
Existence of Christ in many places at once, in this Sacrament, or elsewhere
without dimension of Place, or Space, he has already contradicted you in both,
holding them Impossible: and also by arguing that therefore his flesh is not on
earth, because it is in Heaven. Fourthly, Your manner of properly Eating
Christ's Body Corporally, he will See the fifth Book C. 5.. 2. and C. 6.. 3.
renounce hereafter, as an execrable Imagination. Wherefore Augustine holding
it Impossible for Christ's Body to have any Corporal Existence in this
Sacrament, it is Incredible he could have resolvedly concluded of Christ's
Corporal carrying of his Body properly in his own hands.

THE FIFTH CHALLENGE,
Showing that the [QVODAMMODO] of Saint Augustine is the same manner, which the
Protestants do teach.

Do you then seek after the manner, which Augustine believed? what need you?
having learned it of Augustine himself, by his Secundum quendam modum, (where
he says) this Sacrament after a sort is the Body of Christ: what, literally?
Nay; but (for so he says) August. Sicut secundum quenda^ modum Sacramentum
Corporis, Corpus Christi est; ita Sacramentum fidei fides est. See above. 8. at
(a.)
As Baptism (the Sacrament of Faith) is called Faith. And if you have not the
leisure to look for Augustines judgment in his writings, you might have found
it in your own Book of Decrees, set out by Decret. part 3. de Consecr.
dictinct. 2. C. Hoc est. Sicut ergo caelestis panis, qui Christi caro est, suo
modo vocatur corpus Christi, illius vz. quod, etc. -- vocaturque immolatio
carnis, quae sacerdotis manibus fit, Christi Passio: non rei verirate, sed
significante mysterio. [Observe that in the words, coelestis panis, qui Caro
Christi est, the word caro is by the Gloss in Gratian interpreted Species
panis, at the letter (f) Caro, id est species panis, to avoid the absurdity of
interpreting Christ's flesh to be the Body of Christ.
Gratian, where Augustine is alleged to say, that This holy Bread is after its
manner called the Body of Christ; as the offering thereof by the hands of the
Priest is called Christ's Passion. Dare you say, that the Priest's Oblation is
properly, and literally in strict sense the Passion of Christ? or that Aug.
meant any such a Manner? You dare not, yet if you should, your Glossa. ibid
[Coeleste, etc.] Coeleste Sacramentum, quod vere representat Christi carnem,
Christi caro vocatur: unde dicitur suo modo, non reiveritate, sed significante
mysterio, vt sit sensus, vocatur Christi corpus: i. Significat.
Romish Gloss in that place would presently reprove you saying, that by this
comparison is meant, that The Sacrament, representing the Body of Christ, is
therefore called Christ's flesh, not in verity of the thing, but in a mystery
(namely) as the representation of Christ therein is called his Passion. In a
word rightly might Calvin. Admonit. vlt. ad Westphal. Augustinum totum esse
nostrum, omnes libri clamant.
Calvin say, speaking of these Controversies concerning this Sacrament: All the
Books of Augustine (upon this subject) proclaim that he is of our
profession. Much more, concerning Christ his not being corporally here on
earth, will, by the judgment of Augustine and other Fathers, be found in the
fifth, sixth, and seventh Books; besides that which they affirm in this Book,
in the thirteenth, and sixteenth Sections following.

THE SIXTH CHALLENGE,
In general, concluding the maine Point.

BY this time we think you may discern between plain dealing, and false
iugling: for your Disputers have usually alleged, for defense of your
Transubstantiation, and Corporal Presence in the Sacrament, the sentences of
Fathers used in their Sermons and Exhortations, wherein commonly they exercised
their Rhetoric in Figurative, and Hyperbolicall speeches, as has been
confessed by your own Doctors; and proved by many their like sayings
concerning other Sacramental Rites; but especially of the Sacrament of
Baptism: whereas our proofs arise directly from the testimonies of the
Fathers, which they have commonly had in their sad and earnest Disputations, in
confutation of many, and maine Heresies, where indeed they were necessarily to
make use both of their Logic, for discerning Truth from Error; and also of
Grammar; we mean the Exactness, and propriety of speech void of
Amphibologies, Hyperboles, and Ambiguities, whereby the minds of their Hearers,
or Readers might be perplexed, and the Truth darkened. This one consideration we
judge to be of necessary importance. And thus much concerning the judgment of
ancient Fathers, touching this second Contradiction.

That (thirdly) the Contradiction, and consequently the Impossibility of the
Being of one Body in diverse places at once, is evicted by two sound Reasons;
the first taken from Contradictory Relations.

SECT. IX.
YOu have already See above Chap. 4. 3.
heard of the Antecedent, which was granted by Aquinas, viz. It implies a
Contradiction, to say a Body is corporally in two places at once, because this
makes that one Body not to be one. Which being confessed, you have also heard
your Cardinal making this Consequence, viz. by the same reason it must follow,
that it is absolutely Impossible. But besides, there are Actions and Qualities,
whereof some are Relatives, and have respect to some place, and others are
Absolutes. Of the Relatives you have determined that Vnum corpus in diversis
locis positu^ unum habet esse substantiale, sed multa habet esse localia: ex
quo fit, ut omnia multiplicari debea^t, quae consequuntur esse locale: illa
autem non multiplicantur, quae aliunde proveniunt, Relationes vero ad loca
necessario multiplicantur, propter dime^siones locorum. Itaque erit idem corpus
sursum, and deorsum, propinquum, and remotu^, poterit moveri in locum, and
quiescere in alio loco, nec tamen implicatur ulla contradictio. Illa enim
dicuntur Contradicentia, quae convenient uni respectu eodem, eodem tempore,
modo, loco. Ac ne id mirum videatur, Anima humana, quae tota est in toto
corpore, and quolibet membro Corporis, certe, ut est in capite, est remota a
terra, ut in pedibus propinqua, ut in brachio quiescere dicitur, and ut in
altero motu^ movere. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 4. Ac primum.
One Body (say you) as it is in diverse places at once might be below, and
above, on the right hand, and on the left, behind, and before it self, may
move, and not move, at the same instant, without Contradiction: because it is
so said in diverse Respects, namely of diverse places, as the soul of man in
diverse parts of the Body. So you.

These are but Capriccious Chimera's and mungrell fancies of addle brains, who
disputing of Bodily Locality can find no example, within the Circumferences of
the Vniversalities of Creatures, but only Man's soul, which is a Spirit: which
point is to be discussed in the twelfth Section. In the Interim know you, that
although Relations do sometimes take away Contradictions, where they are
applyable: As namely, for the same Body to be high, and low in respect of it is
own diverse parts, to wit, high in respect of the head, and low in respect of
the heel, wherein there is no comparison of any whole, or part with it self:
yet if any should say as much of the same Body, whether whole, or part, as
thus: The same whole head goes before, and after it self: or, the same one
finger is longer, and shorter then it self; he may justly be suspected to be
besides himself: all such like speeches being as Contradictory in themselves,
(and consequently Impossible) as for a man to say, he is elder, and younger than
himself. You See above Chap. 4.. 3.
will say, (and it is your common Sanctuary) that place is not essential to a
Body, and therefore separable from a Body; so that a man may be in two places
at once. And you may as well say, that because Time is not of the essence of a
man, some man may have a Being without any time, or else in two times at once.
Finally, this your Subtilty would have been judged a palpable absurdity by
ancient Fathers; among whom Theodoret taught this Philosophy, to hold true in
Divinity (to wit) that whosoever has properly one thing on the right hand of
it, and another thing on the left, it is Circumscribed in place. Whereby he
demonstrateth the truth of Christ's Body, because it is Circumscribed: and that
it is circumscribed, because it is written of him, that Theod. Dial. 2: cap.
23. (...).
The sheep shall stand on his right hand, and the goats on the left. Nor do
you your-selves teach, nor yet can you imagine his body to want either his
right hand, or his left, as he is present in this Sacrament. One word more. The
Fathers, who were many, that distinguished the nature of Christ's manhood from
his Godhead, because the first is Circumscribed, and the other is not
circumscribed, would never yield to either of both, that it is both crucified
and not crucified; as you do to Christ's body, teaching it to be at the same
time Circumscribed in Heaven, when it is Uncircumcised, as it is on many
Altars upon earth.

That (fourthly) a Contradiction, (and consequently an Impossibility of the
Being of a Body in two places at once) is proved by absolute Qualities and
Actions, which are void of Relation to place.

SECT. X.
Were it possible, that Actions and Qualities, which have respect to Place,
might avoid the Contradiction; yet of such Actions and Qualities as have no
Relation to place, it will be beyond your imaginations to conceive so, as will
appear by your own Resolutions. For your Cardinal, and your Jesuit Suarez,
with diverse others have thus Corpus Christi, in diversislocis positum, habet
unum substantiale, and quae sunt absoluta in eo non multiplica^tur respectu
diversorum locorum, unde quae recipiuntur a corpore, sive Actiones sint, sive
Qualitates, sive quaecunque alia, non multiplicantur. Ratio, quia corpus unum
est, non multa; ut si corpus Christi in uno loco calesiat, in alio erit
calidum: si in uno loco vulneretur, in altero erit vulneratum. Bellar. lib. 3.
de Euch. cap. 4. Actus contrarij, ut amoris, and odij, assensus, diffensus, non
possunt competere uno subiecto in diversis locis, quia vitales actiones
proficiscuntur ex potentia naturali, ut a principio agente, and eadem potentia
non habet vim naturalem ad efficiendum actus contrarios -- Ratio; inter actus
contrarios -- tantam esse repugnantiam, ut etiam per potentiam Dei absolutam
non possint esse in eodem subiecto, and loco, quia sese omnino destruunt ex
part obiecti, Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. ^8.. 2.. Atque.
determined, that such Actions and Qualities as are real in a Body, without
any relation to place, may not be said to be multiplied in respect of diverse
places, wherein the same Body is supposed to be: (As for example) the same Body
to be hot in some Country, and cold in another at the same time; wounded, and
not wounded; passible, and not passible. And the like may be said of Love, and
Hatred, which are vital Actions, proceeding naturally from the Subject. So
that the Body, which in one place is affected with love, cannot possibly but be
so affected in what place soever. So your own Disputers.

But have they any reason for these points? Yes they have, (See the Margent)
For your Cardinal denying that the same Body, in respect of diverse places, may
be hot, and not hot at the same time, gives us this reason: Because (says
he) it is one Body, and not many. So he. A reason Infallible. Your Jesuit
Suarez also, denying that the same party can love, and hate, consent, and
dissent at the same time, in respect of diverse places, yields this reason;
Because (says he) these repugnant affections belonging to one subject, cannot
by the omnipotency of God be together in the same, because they destroy one
another. Aquinas, and other Schoolmen Quicquid pertinet ad Christu^ secundum
quod in se est, id potest ei tribui in propria specie, and in hoc Sacra mento
existenti, ut vivere, mori, dolere, animatum esse. Aquin. p. 3. q. 81. art 4.
Cum Thoma consentiunt Scotus, Alcisidorus, Aegidius, Petrus a Soto, and huic
favet Innocentius. Suarez quo supra p. 602.
denying that the same Body can be said to grieve, and not to grieve, both at
once, in respect of diverse places of being, propounds the like Reason;
Because Grief being in the same man, as he is a man, cannot be said to be
together with not Grieving in him; lest we should make a man not to be
himself. Lastly, your Cardinal Putatur a quibusdam vetustioribus Theologis
Christum propter varias eius existe^tias simul mortalem, and immortale^,
passibilem, and impassibilem se repraesentare. Alij huic se sententiae
opposuere te^pore Bere^garij, quia viderunt maxim intelligentiae repugnare, ut
idem corpus sit simul mortale, and immortale. Alan. Card. de Euch. Sacram. lib.
1. page 451.
Alan denying that the same Body, in respect of diverse places, can be said to
be Mortal, and Immortal, Passible, and impassible expresses this reason,
which (he says) was used of old: Because these sayings are most repugnant to
the understanding of man. Enough, enough.

CHALLENGE.
WE have in these your Premises received as true Assertions, as sufficient
Reasons, and as absolute Confessions as can be desired, which will be as so
many Poniards sticking fast in the bowels of your Romish Cause, to give it a
deadly wound. As first this: See in this Book Chap. 7.. 3. and 4.
you teach that Christ, as he is in this Sacrament, has no natural faculty,
either of motion, of sense, of Appetite, or of Understanding, all which
notwithstanding he has in all perfection in heaven. But to understand, and
not to understand, to have, and not to have an Appetite, you will confess to
be as absolute Qualities, and Acts Contradictorie, free from respect to place,
as are those which you have allowed, to wit, Grieve, and not grieve, love, and
not love, alive and not alive: because man has an appetite and Desire, an Act
of understanding in himself, not as he is in one place more then in another.
Seeing therefore you have been enforced by infallible Principles of sound
learning to hold it Impossible for one to love, and hate; and to have contrary
passions together, because they are Contradictories, and would infer, that
one man should be, and not be himself. Therefore are you become necessarily
Contradictory to your selves. Can there be a stronger Argument than this, to
persuade Christians, that your Doctors are men delivered up to strong
delusions, to believe lies? of which kind this, of teaching a Body to be in
diverse places at once, is not the least.

CHAP. V.
A Confutation of the first Romish Reason; obtruded for proof of a Possibility
of existence of a Body in diverse places at once, taken from the nature either
of a Voice, or Color.

SECT. I.
MAster In his Book of the Liturgy of the Mass: where he has other as Idle
reasons as this.
Brerely thus: The difficulty may be better conceived, rather then directly
proved, by an example of the same word: the which, being once uttered, is
thereupon at one instant in the several hearing of sundry persons, and that
not as a distinct noise confusedly multiplied in the ^re, but as one and the
same peculiar word, distinguished by the selfsame syllables wherein it was
uttered. So he, and your Doctor Wright In his Book of the Real Presence,
tract. 2. 4. S^bd. 1. p. 149.
before him.

CHALLENGE.
But the Doctor was answered, that the Example is many thousand miles remote
from the Cause, for our Question is of the Presence of the same Body in diverse
places at once. We say, the same Body; but this your Example of Word, or Voice,
which you Both call the same, is not individually the same in every man's
hearing, as is here affirmed, but only the same in kind, by a multiplication
of the sounds, and words uttered, as Philosophy teaches. Like as we see in
throwing a stone into the water, it makes at the first a Circle, and circle
multiplyeth upon circle, till the last come to a large Circumference: Even so
the Verbum, quasi a^rem verberans. Cic.
word, by voice breaking the Air, does make in the Air Circle upon circle,
till it come to the ears of the hearers; every of the parts of the Circle
being articulated through the multiplication of the first form, the diverse
ears doc no more receive the same individual voice, than they do^ the same
individual Air, whereby the voice is conveyed. So that this Example is no
more, in Effect, than to prove the same Body in diverse places at once, by the
sound of a word in many men's ^ares; which is not individually the same, and
serves for nothing rather than to make the Disputer ridiculous.

Thus was that Doctor answered, when he confessed of the voice of the Preacher
in the Pulpit, which is received by multitudes of hearers, and of his other
Example of a color of a red Cow by multiplication of its forms seen of
thousand men's eyes at once, that it is not Numerically the same. Take unto you
a clear Example and Apposite, when in a looking-glass, broken into many
pieces, you see many faces, (all of them being but so many multiplied and
reflected Images of one face) you may see, that every Image in every broken
piece of the glass is not individually the same: wherefore these kinds of
Instances are but Mountebanke tricks, devised to delude men, that love
darkness better then light. It might seem superstitious diligence to confute
such so^tishnes with the serious judgment of any grave Father; otherwise Greg.
Naz. Orat. 51. Vnius corporis locus duorum, aut plurium non est capax: sed
(...).
Gregory Nazianzen is at hand, ready to tell you, that there is as great a
difference between Bodies, and Voices, and Sights; as there is betwixt Bodies,
and Spirits; so that whereas two Bodies cannot be in one place, yet voices, and
sights [(...)] are by an Incorporeall manner apprehended, so that the same Ear
is capable of many voices, and the same sight of many Visibles.

A Confutation of their second, and third Reasons, taken from the Similitude of
man's Soul, or Presence of God, devised to demonstrate a no- Contradiction of
a Body's Being in two places at once.

SECT. II.
TWo other Argumentum sumitur ab exemplis Dei, and animae ratio. nalis. Deus
est unus in infinitis locis indivisibilis, and anima humana est tota in
qualibet par^e corporis. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. c. 3.
Instances you have, whereby to maintain your supposed Bodily Presence in two
places at once; one is in man's Soul, the other in God himself. First, we
will enquire into the nature of the soul. Our exception against a Bodies being
in diverse places at once, is by reason of the distance between place and
place, for it is far less than imaginable that one Body should in one and
the same moment be at Toledo in Spain, and at Paris in France; and yet not to
be in the intermediate Space between both, which divides Toledo from Paris.
But the Condition of the Soul is utterly different, for it is in the Bodily
members, not as a Body in diverse places, but as a form in it is own matter;
nor having Quantity and extension, (the unseperable properties of a Body) but
by a formal perfection, As containing the Body, and not contained thereof,
Anima est in corpore, ut co^tinens, non ut contenta. Aquin. 1. qu. 52. (...).
says your Aquinas. For the Soul is so in the head and foot, that it is
as well in the parts and members between both; and therefore, not being
possibly severed from them, cannot be said to be divided from it self.
Insomuch that if any member of the Body (as for example the hand) should be cut
off, and divided from the Body, the Soul being indivisible cease to be
therein. So utterly dissonant is the Souls being in diverse places.

Nay and your Cardinal having See above Chap. 4. Sect. 3.
confessed already, that It is not possible by any divine power, that a spirit
should be divisible after the manner of a Body; does hereby as fully confute
himself, as if he had said, there is no comparison to be made between Body
and Spirit, in respect of Local being: how much less between it and God the
Father of all Spirits, who cannot be so in many places at once, that he is not
likewise both in every intermediate space, between place and place, and also
in all places without them: this being the property of his infinitenes to
contain all places, and not to be contained of any. And therefore cannot this
manner of presence, without irreligious impiety, be applied to any creature;
which notwithstanding, Quod si quis requirat esse in loco tam circumscriptive
quam definitive, id requirere, ut non sit alibi; dicere possumus daritertium
modum existendi in loco, nimirum, per solam praesentiam, quomodo Deus est in
loco. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. c. 4.. Altero.
your Cardinal blusheth not to do in that manner, as was hitherto (we think)
never imagined by any Divine before him, namely, a manner of being of a Body in
a place, which is neither Circumscriptively, as natural Bodies are, nor
Definitively, that is, so that being in one place, it is not at the same time
in another, as Angels and Spirits are; but a third, how? By only presence after
the manner as God is in place. So he. O golden Divine! for who knows not
that Existence in place only by presence is a property of Divine Infinitenes,
which being attributed to any thing, that is not God, does equal the creature
with the Creator.

A Confutation of the former two Romish Instances in Man's Soul, and God
himself, by Ancient Fathers, in their Doctrine concerning Angels, and Men's
Spirits.

SECT. III.
ANcient Fathers (we trow) were profoundly learned both in Philosophical, and
in Theological Mysteries, who notwithstanding (as your Job 1. 6. [Cum
venissent and astitissent Angeli, etc.] Origin. Athanas. Greg. Nazianz. tanquam
dogma fidei tradunt, Angelos moveri localiter, neque omnibus locis praesentes,
sed esse cuique locum suum, and spatium praefinitum cum illud necessario
requiratur, ut ab uno loco in locum alium veniant. Simili ratione confirmat
hanc veri^atem Tert. Apol. c. 22. Chryso. Hom. in Heb. 1. Ambros. l. 1. de Sp.
S. c. 10. Damasc. l. 2. de fide c. 3. Nazian. Orat. 2. de Theol. Athanas.
Epist. ad Serap. Test Pined^ Ies. in cundem locum Ioh.
Jesuit witnesses) held it as a Doctrine of Faith, that Angels, which are
Spirits, have every one their own definite places and space, and that they
cannot be in diverse places, but by moving from one place to another, which
cannot be said of any Body that (as you say) is without motion in diverse places
at once. Surely, if ever such strange and paraphysicall, nay more then
Hyperphysicall Croche^s had entered into the minds of ancient Fathers, we should
have heard you allege, at least some one of them, if not for proof, yet in
pretext and color of patronizing these your repugnant Paradoxes, concerning a
Body taking the right hand, or left of it self, and the like, -- Velut aegri
somnia vanae finguntur Species.

For your better satisfaction, we shall allege some Testimonies, which may
sufficiently declare their Judgment of an Impossibility of a Spirit's being
in diverse places at one time, whether we consider the Spirits of Angels, or of
men; yea or the humane Spirit or soul of Christ. Of Angels, Damascen;
Damascen. Orthod. fid. l. 1. c. 17. and l. 3. c. 7. Angelus dicitur esse in
loco, (...). Deus autem ubique existens, corpora vero (...).
They are so circumscribed in the place where they work, that they cannot
possibly be in more places at once. Athanasius, Athanas. Tom. 1. Epist. ad
Serap. p. 201. (...).
As the Holy Ghost fills all places, so Angels are contained in a certain
place. Accordingly Ambrose: Ambros. de Sp. S. lib. 1. cap. 10. Seraphim quod
iubetur exequitur, Spiritus quod vult dividit: Seraphim de loco ad locum
transit, non cnim complet omnia, sed ipsum repletur a Spiritu.
Herein do Angels differ from the holy Ghost, which fills all things, that
the S^raphims do move from place to place. Pope Gregory would be heard speak:
Greg. Moral. lib. 2. cap. 3. Angeli, ut and nos, loco circumscribuntur:
comparatione quidem corporum nostrorum Spiritus sunt, comparatione Dei
incircumscripti, corpus sunt.
Angels are c^rcumscribed, being, in respect of our Bodies, Spirits: but, in
comparison of the uncircumscribed God, they are to be esteemed as Bodies. So
they. Our next speculation must be touching the souls of Saints departed. The
Author set out by your selves, in the name of Athanasius, unto this Objection;
How do the souls of Saints so often appear at one moment of time in the
Sepulchers, as they seem to have done? Answers that They are not the same
Saints, but rather visions, and adumbrations of them, by transfigurations of
Angels. He gives his Reason, why he thinks the other impossible, Athanas.
qu^st. ad Antioch. 26. Quomodo (cedo mihi) una existens Petri aut Pauli anima,
(...) apparere in ^^o monumento, and in mill templis per totum mundum, ne^
Angelus potest? (...). Edit. Paris. Anno 1627.
Because it is proper (says he) to God alone to be at one moment of time in
two places at once. So he. And if the Fathers shall say, in effect, as much of
the humane soul of Christ, you (we should think) would require no more.
Tertull^an among his many divine Answers, to prove Christ to be God, he urges
the Arian Heretics with this one, as not the least: Tert. de Trinit. circiter
medium. Si homo tantummodo Christus, quomodo adest ubique invocatus? cum haec
non hominis natura sit, sed Dei, ut adesse possit in omni loco* si homo
tan^ummodo Christus, cur and Mediator invocatur? etc.
Because Christ is present in all places, where he is invocated upon, which is
a power not incident unto man, but proper to the nature of God. So he. How
like you this? And Augustine may not be thought to dissent, when in arguing he
took as granted, that the Aug. Epist. 57. ad Dardan. [M^cum ^ris in Paradiso.]
Non ex bis verbis in coelo existimandus Paradisus, neque enim in ^pso die
futurus erat in coelo ho no Christus, sed in inferno secundu^ animam, and in
sepulch^o secundum carnem.
Soul of Christ, when it departed this life, could not be in Heaven, and in
hell at once.

As for the Being of God in diverse places at once, which was your Cardinal's
instance, for proof of a Possibility of the Being of Christ's Body in many
places, without Contradiction of making One not One, by dividing it from it
self; we know not whether rather to censure it ^gregiously absurd, or
extremely impious; seeing that the Being of God in diverse places at once
without Contradiction arises from the very nature of God's Infinitenes of
Being in whatsoever place: which is (as your own School might have taught
him) so, as Aquinas 1. qu. 52 Art 2.
Containing all places, and not contained in any: which the Fathers have as
fully declared, in making Being in all places, as filling them with his
presence, to be the property of his Deity. Such then is the impiety of your
arguing; by laboring to defend the manner of the Being of a Body, by the
manner of Being of a Soul or Spirit, denied by Nazian. Orat. 51 cont.
Apollinar. Obijcientem: Duo perfecta non continebat Christus, vz. divinitatem
and humanitatem. Resp. (...) (ut vas unius modij non duos modios continet)
(...). etc.
Nazianzene; and manner of the Being of a Creature, by the manner of the Being
of God the Creator, excedeth all Absurdities that can be named. The holy
Fathers have something more to Below Chap. 6. Sect. 2.
say to you; but first we are willing to hear what you can say for your selves.

A Confutation of the Third Romish Pretense; why they need not yield to these
Reasons, whereby their Doctrine is proved to be so grossly Unreasonable.

SECT. IV.
MYsteries of Faith, (says your Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 3. Argumentum
sumitur a mysterijs, etc.
Cardinal) which excede man's understanding, are only to be apprehended by
Faith. Such as are the Articles of the Trinity of Christ his Incarnation, of
the Resurrection, of the Creation, and of Eternity it self; and so ought this,
concerning the Presence of Christ his Body, notwithstanding any Objection from
Reason. So you. We answer. Some of these former Mysteries we confess to be
such as excede man's understanding, yet such again they are, as are not
contrary to understanding, though above it; that is to say, such (and this you
will confess with us) as admit not Contradiction in themselves: for it is no
Contradiction to say of the Trinity there is One God, and Three Persons,
because the Essence of the Godhead is common to each person: or to say in the
Incarnation there is one Person, and two natures; no more than to say, that in
one man there is one person, and two essential parts, one his Body, the other
his Spirit: or in the Resurrection to believe the same that was created, might
be restored to life, more than to believe that one grain of Corn dying, might
revive again: or in the Creation to believe that something may be made of
nothing, than to say that a blind man was made to see. As for the last
Objection, saying that Aeternitas est instans Durationis. Bellar. ibid..
Quin^um.
Eternity is the instant of Duration, it is an atheologicall Paradoxe: for
Eternity is Duration it self, without beginning, or ending; which is
conceived without Contradiction.

In all these your former Pretenses nothing is more considerable than the
miserable Exigence whereunto your Disputers are brought, whilst they are
constrained, for avoiding of Contradictions in things subject to the
determination of Sense, to pose us with spiritual Mysteries, which are Objects
only of Faith, by reason of the Infinitenes of their properties; and therefore
may well exceed the reach of man's wit, and apprehension, without any prejudice
unto Truth, by contradiction: as if they meant to teach men to put out their
eyes, and never any more to discern any sensible things, by sensible means.
By which manner of reasoning all the Arguments used by the Apostles against
Infidels, for proof of the Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ's Body; all
the Reasons of Fathers against Heretics, in distinguishing of the Properties
of the divine and humane nature of Christ in himself, and their former
Testimonies in discerning Bodies from Spirits by Circumscription, and Spirits
from God by Determination in one place; and lastly your own Consequences of
many confessed Impossibilities concerning Place, (as the Impossibility that God
should be contained in Place, as for one Body having Quantity to be incapable
of a Place, and the like) are all utterly made void. For to what end were any
of these, if your Pretenses have in them any shadow of Truth?

CHAP. VI.
The third Romish Contradiction, against the words of Christ [MY BODY,] is by
making a Body Finite, to be a Body not finite.

SECT. I.
IF (as you have said) the Body of Christ is, or may be at one time in so many
places, then may it be in mo^, and consequently everywhere at one instant.
This Consequence your ancient Schoolmen taught, and your Jesuit Quasi non
possit creatura esse ubique hoc (inquam) non obstat, nam omnipotentiam illi
intellexerunt prorsus naturalem, quia si non aliena virtute, sed suapte natura
res existat ubique praesens, haec revera nulli creaturae convenit. Ar nos
altero modo non nisi per absolutam Dei potentiam vbiquitatem creaturae
convenire arbitramur, Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de vera Christi praesent. in Euch.
c. 12.. Quaesane. page 241.
Valentia does seem to avow, saying, What hinders that a Body may be [Vbique]
every where at once, not by it is natural power, but by the omnipotency of
God? So he. This we say is to make a finite infinite; and your old
Schoole-Doctors are hereunto witnesses, who have judged it Veterum Theologorum
apud D. Thomam ratio haec est, si idem corpus possit esse in duobus locis
simul, potest in pluribus, atque adeo ubique -- Et una cum codem Thoma dicunt,
Haereticum esse affirmare, corpus Christi esse poss^ in duobus locis simul,
quia ubique esse, est proprium Deo. Test Suarez Tom. 3. qu. 75. Art. 1. disp.
48. Sect. 4.
Heretical, to say, that the Body of Christ can be in diverse places at once;
because then he may be in infinite. So they. And hear you what your Cardinal
Bellarmine has publicly taught? To say ( Dicere corpus Christi esse, vel esse
posse in Infinitis locis simul, immensitatem divinam requirit. Bellar. lib. 3.
de Christio. c. 18.
says he) that the Body of Christ may be in infinite places at once, is to
ascribe an Immensity and infinitenes unto it (namely, that) which is proper
unto God. So he, and so also your other Doctors, to whom the Evidence of Truth
commands us to assent.

For what greater Heresy can there be against that Article of our Faith,
concerning the Deity, and Godhead of Christ begotten, not made, than to believe
that there can be a made God? for so doubtless do they (whosoever they be)
that think a finite Body may be made Infinite.

CHALLENGE.
YOu understand the Argument, viz. To believe that Christ his Body may be every
where, is a flat Heresy: but to affirm, that the same Body is in many places
at once, does consequently infer that it may be every where (as has been
directly professed.) Ergo your Doctrine of attributing to the Body of Christ an
Existence, in many places at once, is by the confessed general grounds of
Christianity plainly Heretical. And from this our Conclusion your Aquinas will
in no wise dissent, who himself concludes Aquinas 1. q. 52. art. 2. Deus est
essentia infinita, ideo non solum in pluribus locis est, sed ubique. Angelus
quia est virtutis finitae non se extendit nisi ad unum determinatum -- unde
sequitur quod non sit ubique, neque in pluribus locis, sed in uno loco tantum.
That the Angel is not in diverse places at once, because an Angel is a finite
creature, and therefore of a finite power and operation; it being proper to God
to be in many places at once. So he.

That, by the judgment of Ancient Fathers, the Being in diverse places at once
infers an Infiniteness proper unto God: which without Heresy cannot be
ascribed to any humane Body; Proved from the manner of Existence of the Holy
Ghost.

SECT. II.
STill you maintain the Real and Corporal presence of Christ his Body in so
many places, as there are consecrated Hoasts at one time in the whole world, be
they ten thousand times ten Millions of Millions, or how many soever: which,
say we, is to make the Finite Body of Christ Infinite. For Aquinas (as your
Vnum corpus esse ubique affirmare est Haereticum. Thomas. Quia Catholici ex hac
proprietate essendi ubique dicunt antiquos Patres sufficienter probasse
Spiritus Sancti Diviniratem, ut patet ex Augustino, Fulgent. Ambrosio, Basil.
Test Suarez. Ies. To^. 3. disp. 48. Sect. 4. Rat. 1.
Jesuit witnesses) held it Heretical, to affirm One Body to be every where,
because this is a Divine property, by which the Fathers did sufficiently prove
the Godhead of the Holy Ghost, (namely) Augustine, Fulgentius, Ambrose, and
Basil. So he.

But how did the Fathers prove this, think you? it were good, that where your
own Authors be silent, we heard some of themselves speak. Fulgent. ad
Trasimund. lib. 2. page 325. Spiritus Sancti in nobis habitatio non localis
est, inhabitat enim Trinitas in suis fidelibus, sicut tota in cunctis: nec per
separatos homines, and separata loca particulariter separatur.
Fulgentius his reason is, Because the Spirit of God dwells wholly in all the
faithful separated in diverse places. Basil. de Sp. Sancto cap. 22. sub finem.
Reliquae virtutes omnes in loco circumscriptae esse creduntur, nam Angelus qui
astabat Cornelio non erat in eodem loco, quo cum astaret Philippo: neque qui
locutus est Zachariae ab Altari per idem tempus etiam in coelo suam implebat
stationem. At Spiritus (Sanctus) simul and in Abaccuc operatus, and in Daniele
in Babylonia creditus, and in Catarcta cum Ieremia, and cum Ezechiele in
Chobar; Spiritus enim Domini replevit orbem terrarum, [Quo ibo a Spiritu tuo?]
Et Propheta; Quon^am ego, inquit, vobiscum sum, and Spiritus meusstat in medio
vestri.
Basil thus: The Angel, that was with Cornelius, was not at the same time with
Philip, nor was he then in Heaven, when he was with Zachary at the Altar: But
the Holy Ghost was together with the Prophet Daniel in Babylon, with Jeremy in
the Dungeon, and with Ezekiel in Chobar. Ambros. de Spirit. Sancto l. 1. c. 7.
Cum igitur omnis creatura certis naturae suae circumscripta limitibus, siquidem
and illa invisibilia opera, quae non queunt locis and finibus compre^ hendi,
substantiae tamen suae proprietate clauduntur, quomo. do quis audeat creaturam
Spi. Sanctum appellare, qui non habet circumscripta^ and determinatam naturam?
-- Ideo cum Dominus servos suos Apostolos destinare voluit, ut agnosceremus
aliam esse naturam, aliud gratiam spiritualem, alios alio destinabat, quia
simul omnes esse ubique non poterant; dedit autem Spirit. Sanctum, qui licet
separatis Apostolis inseperabilis gratiae mun^s infunderet: quis igitur
dubitat, quin divinum sit quod infunditur, simul pluribus, nec videtur?
corporeum autem quod videtur a singulis, and tenetur.
Ambrose thus: Because the Apostles could not all be every where, Christ
severed them, giving them all the Holy Ghost, which was inseparable in them:
none therefore can doubt but it is a Divine Essence. Aug cont. Maxim. Axian.
Epist. l. 3. c. 21. Cum sic laudetis Sp. Sanctum, ut in sanctific and is
fidelibus ubique praesentem esse dicatis, tamen negare audeatis esse Deum? [The
Vbique spoken of the faithful has the sense of Vbicunque, because the number
of the faithful is but finite, and their places distinct, here and there, and
not absolutely everywhere.]
Augustine confuteth an Arian Bishop, thus: You that praise the holy Spirit, in
sanctifying his faithful wheresoever they are, how can you deny him to be God?
Didymus Alex. lib. 1. de Spirit. Sancto, Hieron. interpret, (extat in
Biblioth. S. Patrum Tom. 6. page 679.) Iose Spiritus Sanctus, si unus esset de
creaturis, saltem circumscriptam haberet substantiam -- Spiritus autem Sanctus
cum in pluribus sit, non habet substantiam circumscriptam. [And he proves it
is Pluribus, idem in Prophetis and Apostolis, etc.]
Didymus of Alexandria (whom Hierome acknowledges as his Master, for the
understanding of Scripture) thus: The Holy Ghost (seeing it is in many places
at once) may not be thought to be a Creature. Lastly upon the same ground
Cyrill of Alexandria makes the same Conclusion: Cyril. Alex. de Spirit. Sancto
(quod non est Creatura.) Quum in loco and circumscriptione intelligant quae
facta sunt, Spi. autem Sanctus non sit, de quo psallit David, Quo ibo a Spiritu
tuo?
The Spirit of God is no Creature (says he) because things created are in one
place, but of the Spirit of God it is written, Whither shall I go from thy
presence? So these holy Fathers, every one Gatholique, without exception.

CHALLENGE.
ASyllogisme from these premises will set all straight. To ascribe to a Body an
Omni-presency, and power of being every where, is Heretical. But to say that a
Body is in diverse places at once, does consequently infer a power of being in
every place (as it does in demonstrating the Holy Ghost to be a divine Spirit.)
Therefore to attribute to a Body, a Being in diverse places at once, is a
Doctrine Heretical, and implies a Contradiction, by affirming a Finite thing
to be infinite. Add but hereunto the former See above Chap. 5. and 6.
Testimonies of Fathers, who have distinguished the humane nature of Christ
from his Godhead, and their denying of all Possibilities of Existence of
Angels in two places at once: and your Consciences must needs tell you, that it
was Impossible for the Fathers to have believed your Romish Article of a
Corporal Presence in every Host consecrated at onetime, on diverse Altars in
your several Churches. What shall we then further say concerning a Being of a
Body in diverse places at once? Surely (that which has been plentifully proved
already) that such an (...) is egregiously (...) as well in Divine, as in
natural Philosophy, because (as this whole Discourse shows) they have
verified that saying of Aristotle, (...).

CHAP. VII.
Of the (fourth) Romish Contradiction against the words of Christ [MY BODY] by
teaching it to be Organicall, and not Organicall; Divisible, and Indivisible.

SECT. I.
THe Question is not now of the Mystical presence of Christ his Body in the
Sacrament, which we with the Fathers, especially Greg. Nyssen. in Orat. Catech.
C. 37. Per totum orbem ^ide liu^ millibus uno die impertitur, totumque cuiusque
per partem evadat, and in seipso totu^ permaneat, etc. Objected by Master
Brereley Liturg. Tract. 2. Subdiv. 1. [Answered before, Chap. 4. Sect. 7.]
Greg. Nyssen confess to be whole, as well in a part of Bread consecrated, as
in the whole loaf; even as the Image of the King may be as perfect in a penny,
as in a shilling. But neither he, nor any Father ever said that a little Host
(which boast you call Christ) is equal with a great Host; No, for the Fathers
in the Council of See below, Chapter 10.
Nice absolutely denied this: nor yet is Christ wholly represented in the least
part of the Host, as your Fathers of See Sect. 3. following.
Trent have taught, because no such part can resemble Totum Christum, whole
Christ Sacramentally, which is not of sufficient bigness to be sensibly eaten in
the nature of nourishment; thereby to resemble the Spiritual nourishment of
our Souls, which is the Body of Christ. So that all you have said makes just
nothing for the Corporal, and material Presence of Christ's Body, which we
further impugn.

That it is necessary the Body of Christ (wheresoever) consist of distinct
members and proportions of a Body.

SECT. II.
THe Body of Christ (as we profess) had perfect Dimensions and Distinctions of
parts, an head exposed to pricking with thorns, a face to buffers, a back to
scourges, eyes to visible noddings and mockings, ears to blasphemies, hands
and feet to piercing with nails. This is that Body which we confess to be the
Body of Christ, and which we celebrate in the use of this Sacrament, in
Remembrance that he had a Body consisting of proportion of diverse parts,
distinct one from another. Two of your Magnitudo and figura unitae sunt corpori
Christi naturaliter and inseperabiliter -- and Christus corpus suum carnem
vocat, Ioh. 6. At certe substantia sine quantitate and complexione quadam
accidentium caro dici non potest -- Denique in corpore Christi eius animainest:
atqui anima in corpore esse nequit, nisi disposito and organizato. Secundo
extensum esse in se, and partem habere extra partem, and proinde situm quendam
intrinsecum and ordinem habere, and dispositionem partium, omnino essentiale
magnitudini est. Quid enim linea nisi extensio in longitudinem? etc. Si tollas
igitur extensionem, and parts, tollis pariter magnitudinem. Bellar. l. 3. de
Euch. c. 5. Tollere partium distinctionem ponit monstrosam corporis
confusionem, ut ibi sit nasus, ubi oculus; and manus, etc. Alan. l. 1. de Euch.
c. 3. p. 444.
Cardinals do both answer that Quantity, magnitude, proportion, and extension
of parts are unseparably united to the Body of Christ in this Sacrament: or
else (says one) If the Nose should stand where the Eye is, and the Eye where
the Nose is, it should be a confused Monster. So they. So necessary it is; even
in your own faith, that the Body of Christ consist of Organicall parts,
distinct one from another.

That the Romish Church has decreed a doctrine of Corporal Presence of a Body
of Christ, withal the parts thereof in the least indivisible point of the
Host.

SECT. III.
THe Canons of that Totus and integer Christus sub specie panis, and sub
qualibet eius speciei part inest. Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 3. Sub quavis
particula. Catech. R^. de Euch. number. 29.
Council of Trent decreed, as a Doctrine of Faith necessary to salvation, to
believe, That the Body of Christ in this Sacrament is whole in every part of
the Host; whereby is meant (says your In singulis partibus continuis, quantum
vis minimis, and ejusdem quantitatis. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. D. 52. Sect. 2. p.
679.
Jesuit) The whole Body of Christ is in every albeit the least part of the
Host. So he. But we demand; how then shall the Body of Christ but want
proportion of distinct parts, which you say are Unseparably united to a Body?
You distinguish, that the Respondeo, quod est difficillimum, ob humani ingenij
imbecilitatem. Dico corpus Domini habere partem extra partem, si vox [extra]
dicat habitudinem ad subiectum, non si dicat habitudinem ad obiectum, non si
dicat habitudinem ad locum. Resp. nego consequentiam, quia distinctio partium
in subjecto est essentialis: at distinctio quoad locum non est essentialis, sed
impediri potest. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. Ca. 7. Negatur esse impossible, corpus
quantum in indivisibili puncto collocari: quin potius impossible est corpus
Christi esse totum in toto, quum sit etiam in punctis and terminis, quibus
parts specierum Sacramentalium continuantur. Suarez quo supra p. ^83.
Body of Christ being in this Sacrament has extension of parts of a Body
distinctly in it self; but in respect of the Place, or of the forms of Bread,
under which it is, the whole Body is without distinction in every least Part
and indivisible Point thereof.

CHALLENGE.
THis is the common Resolution of the now Church of Rome. The exact discussion
of this one point will in it self illuminate the eyes of any Reader, to
discern between the Spirit of Truth, and of Error; namely, to know, that
there cannot be a greater Contradiction (and consequently Impossibility) than
for a Body, consisting of proportionable dimensions of Parts, such as are
Hands, Legs, Eyes, and other Organicall members, to have Being any where
without Extension, Commensuration, and distinct Proportion of the same to the
space, wherein it is, as the Propositions following will prove.

That the former Romish Tridentine Article is new, and contrary to the nature
of an Organicall and humane Body, in the Judgment of Romish Doctors of latter
times.

SECT. IV.
ALbertus, Scotus, Aegidius are recounted amongst your learned, and Ancient
Schoolmen, who (as your Totum Christi corpus in partibus indivisilibus
specierum panis esse negarunt Albertus, Scotus, Aegidius -- quia videtur
impossible, in se corpus extensum, and magnae molis cum tota organizatione,
and figura in puncto collocari. Suarez quo supra. p. 683.
Jesuit testifies) Thought it impossible, that a Body that has extension of
parts, should be contained in an indivisible point. The same opinion is
ascribed by your Jesuits (as ancient) unto Opinio antiqua, quae fuit Durandi,
dixit corpus Christi in Eucharistia non haberequantitate^. Fundamentum huius
opinionis fuit, quod essentia quantitatis est, habere parts extra parts
distinctas inter se, fieri aurem non possit, ut si corpus Christi habeat parts
distinctas, in Euch. sit totum in qualibet part. Test Maldonat. Ies. Tom. 1.
de Euch. c. 8. Arg. p. 180. and Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 5.
Durand, and Occham, and alij dixerunt quidam esse magnitudinem corporis
Christi in Eucharistia: ^ed ita, ut nulla sit figura, nec distinctio partium.
Sic Occham. Bellar. ibid.. At.
Occham. Now what greater injury can there be, than, after that it was lawful
for a thousand, and four hundredth years since the Ascension of Christ, for
any Christian to profess (with your ancient Schoolmen) an Impossibility,
that The Body of Christ is whole in every the least part of the Host; to
impose upon men's consciences, as an Article of Faith, so fond and so palpable
a figment. That which seemed to the abovenamed Durand, and Occham such an
Opinion, whence (as they thought) it must needs follow, that the Eyes must be
where the Nose is, the hand confounded with the legs: which (as your
Cardinal Alan truly said) were to make of the Body of Christ a confused Chaos,
and altogether See above in this Chapter, Sect. 2.
monstrous.

That the Organicall parts of the Body of Christ must be proportionable to the
Dimension of the places, wherein they are; is proved by the confessed Romish
Principle it self.

SECT. V.
THe reason, which your See above, Sect. 2.
Cardinal lays down to prove it necessary, that Christ his Body should have
in it self (according to the nature of a Body, distinct parts of head and
eyes, and other Organs fit for the use of a reasonable Soul, he takes from
Magnitude, which is an Extension of parts into their proportionable length,
breadth, and depth: this (says he) is inseparably united to Christ his Body in
its own intrinsecall disposition, in it self; but not so (says he) in regard
of the place.

CHALLENGE.
THis your own Reason may we justly retort upon your selves, proving, that if
the natural disposition of the Body of Christ be thus proportionably extended
in it self, it must be so likewise in respect of place, and space; because the
three dimensions of the Body of Christ (as you have confessed) stand thus, that
one is an extension in Length, another in Breadth, the third in Depth, and each
of these three are distinct one from another. Well then, The arm must be here,
and thus far longer than the foot, the leg here, and thus far thicker
than the finger, the hand here, and thus far broader than the toe, and
accordingly distinctly in other parts. But Hic, and Hucusque; Here and There,
thus far, and so far, being Relatives of space, and place, do
demonstratively show that that Extension of distinct parts of the Body, which
they have in themselves divisibly, the same they must necessarily have in
respect of the Vbi, place, or space, wherein the Body is. If therefore you will
not Heretically teach a Mathematical, or Fantastical body of Christ, you
must deny the Article of Trent, until you can believe, and make good, that a
part of a divisible Body, longer or shorter, broader or narrower, can be (and
that equally) in one indivisible point.

This is confirmed by the Essence of Christ his glorified Body, (as you
confess it to be) now in Heaven, possessing a Real place in the said
proportion of Spaces of length, and breadth, as it had here upon earth, which
it does by the natural Magnitude, or Quantity thereof. But the said natural
magnitude, or quantity of the said Body of Christ is (according to your own
general Doctrine) in this Sacrament. Therefore must it have the same
Commensuration of Space.

We should be loath to trouble your wits with these speculations, if that the
necessity of the Cause (by reason of the Absurdities of your Romish profession)
did not enforce us hereunto; Therefore must you suffer us a little to sport at
your trifling seriousness, who writing of this divine Sacrament, and seeing it
to be round, solid, broken, molded, in the one kind; and liquid, frozen, and
sowring in the other, do attribute all these to Quantities, and Qualities, and
Accidents, without any other subject at all. So then by the Romish Faith we
shall be constrained to believe, in effect, that the Cup is filled with
Mathematical lines, the Mouse eating the Host is fed with colors, and
forms: that it is Coldness that freezeth, and Roundnesse which weighs
down, and falls to the ground; as if you should describe a Romish
Communicant to be a creature clothed with Shadows, armed with Idaea's, fed
with Abstracts, augmented with Fancies, second Intentions, and Individual
Vagues, and consisting wholly of Chimaera's.

That your Romish Doctrine is contrary to the Judgment of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. VI.
IF this your profession had been a Catholic Doctrine, doubtless Saint
Augustine (who is so devout in his fervent Meditations upon this holy mystery)
would not have oppugned it, as he did, when unto that Question of Volusianus
(whether the Body of Christ before his birth did fill the Body of the blessed
Virgin) he answered, Aug. Nullum corpus potest esse ubique totum, quantumcunque
corpus, vel quantulum^unque corpusculum loci occupet spacium, cundemque locum
sic occupet, ut in nulla eius part sit totum necesse est: long alia natura
est animae, quam corporis, quanto magis Dei? l. 1. Ep. 3. ad Volusian: [Whose
question to S. Augustine was; Vtrum Christus intemeratae foeminae corpus
impleverit?]
That every body, be it greater or less, wheresoever it is, must needs fill
that space wherein it is, so that the same Body cannot be the whole in any part
thereof. So he: which is directly Contradictory to your Article of Trent, for
here is express mention of Relation to place and space.

And whereas for usual color of a Possibility, that the whole Body of Christ
is in every part of the Host, you have objected the Example of Man's Soul,
which is said to be whole in every member and part of the Body: S. Augustine
(as if he had foreseen your mystery of Error) pre-occupateth, saying, In
eo, quod dicitur Deus ubique carnali cogitationi resistendu^ est, and men's ^
Corporis sensibus amovenda, ne quasi spaciosa magnitudine opinemur Deum per
cuncta diffundi, ut aer, aut lux: omnis enim huiusmodi magnitudo minor in sua
part, quam in roto: sed ita potius, ut est magna sapientia etiam in homine,
cuius corpus est parvum. -- Nam si duo fint homines aequaliter sapientes,
quorum alter est corpore grandior, non plus sapiuntambo, quam singuli; sic in
minore corpore non minor est sanitas, cum minora, and maiora corpora tam sana
sint. -- Dispar est profecto in membrorum molibus quantitas: sed par est in
disparatis sanitas -- quae non quantitas, sed qualitas est. Non potuit ergo
obtinere quantitas corporis quod Qualitas. Aug. Ep. 57. ad Dardan.
The nature of a Soul is far different from the nature of a Body. And again
the same holy Father, seeking to find out some Similitude, whereby wholly to
resemble the Existence of God in respect of place, in the end says, that
Quality has a prerogative to make some Similitude hereof: and he does
instance in Wisdom, which (says he) is as great in a little man as in a
great man; but denies that Quantity has any such Privilege, for speaking of
Quantity and Magnitude, In all such Quantity, or magnitude (says he) there is
less in the part, then there is in the whole. And by this same Maxim
(concerning whole in respect of Place) he distinguishes the Godhead from the
Manhood, by which you have confounded them. And yet again elsewhere (as
though he thought this your delusion could never be sufficiently contradicted,
or rather derided) he will further have you not to be so Childish, as not to
know, that Idem. Minor est unus digitus, quam tota manus, and minor est digitus
unus quam duo; and alibi est iste digitus, alibi ille, alibi coetera manus --
Nec solum immobilibus corporis articulis -- sed etiam aeris parts suos implent
locos -- Lucisque pars alia infunditur per hanc fenestram, alia per aliam, and
mayor per maiorem, per minorem autem minor. Idem. To. 6. Ep. fundamenti. c. 16.
The little finger is less than the whole hand, and one finger is less than
two, and that one finger is one where, and the other another where. Upon which
where, and where, being notes of distinct places, we may ask, where are your
Disputers now? Nay yet furthermore, passing from grosser Bodies, he says as
much of Air, yea, and of the most subtle of subtils, the light of the Sun;
one part whereof (says he) comes in at one Window, another at another
window, yet so, that the less passes through the less, and the greater
through the greater.

Moreover, if Saint Gregory once Bishop of Rome had believed that Christ his
Body is whole in every least indivisible part of the Host, he would never have
condemned the Eutychian Heretic for believing Adiungebat (Haereticus) omne
illud, quod in Domino palpari potuit, post resurrectionem in subtilitatem
aliquam esse red actam. Greg. Exposi. Moral. li. 14. c. 31.
The Body of Christ to have been brought into such a subtilty, that is cannot
be felt. But a greater subtilty there cannot be, than for a divisible Body to
be enclosed in every the least indivisible point. Show us this Doctrine taught
by any Catholic Doctor in the Church within the compass of the twelve hundred
years after Christ, and then shall we conceive better of your Cause. And lest
you may talk (as you use) of one body penetrating another, we say unto you,
as Damascen said unto his Reader, that Damascen. lib. 1. de Orthodox. fide. c.
4. (...).
This is impossible, but that either the one or the other must be divided
asunder.

That the Romish Objections, against our former Tenet, are feeble and vain.

SECT. VII.
IT is ordinarily in the mouths of every one of you to object the Miraculous
entrance of Christ into the house, the doors being shut; his coming out of the
grave, when it was covered with a stone; his birth from his mother, her womb
being shut; besides the miraculous passing of a Camel through the Eye of a
needle, spoken of by Christ; all Miraculous indeed, as we, with many holy
Chrysostom. Nazia^z. Aug. Ambros.
Fathers, do willingly Confess. What therefore? Therefore (say you) the Body
of Christ did pass through the substantial dimensions of the Body of the
Doors, Stone, and womb, and consequently confuteth all this, which has been
spoken of the Organicall proportions of a body, in respect of space, or place.
So you. We grant unto you as much as these Fathers speak, in noting each of
these to have been the Acts, and works of Omnipotency, but yet without any
penetration of Dimensions at all, or yet Alteration of the just proportion of
Christ's body. Which penetration of Dimensions seemed to your Durand. Disp. 44.
qu. 6. [Whom you therefore reject.] Test Suarez. Tom. 2. Disp. 48. qu. 54. Art.
4.. 5.
Durand as incredible, as unto us.

The principal Testimony which is insisted upon, concerning the passing of
Christ through the Doors, is the saying of Chrysostom, viz. (...). Chrysostom.
Hom. 87. in Job. 21. [but according to the Latin Edition. Hom. 86. super Ioh.
20. This testimony was objected against P. Martyr in the Disp. at Oxon. fol 60.]
Christ's Body was thin, or small, changed from [(...),] that is, it is
Thicknes, impalpable unto mortal man's hand, but only by divine permission and
dispensation. So he. And this is alleged for proof of a Possibility of his
now Corporal Presence in the Sacrament, void of Palpabilitie: never
considering the Ordinary and confessed Hyperbole's, wherewith Chrysostom
embellisheth his Sermons; insomuch that we may oppose Chrysostom against
Chrysostom, even in the point in question: who elsewhere speaking of this
Sacrament, says that Christ herein Book 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 6.
Gives his Body both to be felt and seen; whereas every Priests hands and
eyes can testify the Contrary. For what? that Christ his Body, in passing
through the Door, should not always have been palpable in it self? The
Fathers of the General Council at Ephesus would have protested against this;
whose Resolution is, that Conc. Ephesians. Tom. 5. C. 1. Anathem. 3. Non alienum
est ab illo corpus, quod sibi univit, quod ubique palpabile, and aspectabile
existit.
The Body which Christ united to his God head is palpable: but you will ask
then, how could it pass through either Stones, or Doors, without penetration
of Dimensions, or else by an extreme tenuity of the Body it self? We answer,
the divine power constrained the Stone and Doors to yield a passage, the
Thicknes of his Body continuing the same. We have Jerome for the first part
teaching. Hier. Creatura cessit Creatori.
The Creature (says he) yielded to the Creator: and ancient I^stin. quaest.
and Resp. ad Orthodox. (...), etc.
Iustine, for the second, saying that The passage of Christ through the Doors
was, by his Divine power, above nature, in his vnaltred Body; which Body
consists of thick parts. He proceeds, showing how; even as was his walking
upon the Water, by divine power working upon the water, without any Alteration
of his Body, more than was of the Body of Peter, who was enabled by the same
power to tread the water.

Each of which sayings of the Fathers, professing a Body of Christ palpable,
whether Thin with Chrysostom, or Thick with Iustine, do confute your
Tridentine Faith in believing a Body of Christ whole in the whole, and whole in
every least part of the Host, as unpalpable to man as you have said it is
invisible to the Angels themselves: which is to bring it to such a Subtilty, as
will draw you whether you will or no into a kindred with the Eutychian
Heretics, who (as your Aquinas. par. 3. qu. 54. art. 2. Respondeo. Vide
corpus Christi non habuisse parts corporis naturales, pertinet ad errorem
Eutychij, qui dicebat corpus nostrum in illa resurrectionis gloria impalpabile,
and ventis aereque subtilius: Et quod Dominus post confirmata corda
Discipulorum palpantium, omne illud, quod in to palpari potuit, in aliquam
subtilitatem redegit, ut Greg. exponit, Moral. lib. 14. cap. 31.
Aquinas will have you know) held the Body of Christ to have been as subtle
as the air, and as the wind impalpable; as did also the Prateol. Elench.
Haeret. Tit. Eunomiani. -- Dicebant corpus nostrum post Resurrectionem
impalpabile esse and invisible; imo aere and vento subtilius: de qua haeresi
Grego^ius Eutychium convincit.
Eunomians, and were therefore condemned by Pope Gregory surnamed the Great.

Some more difficulty you suppose to be in the manner of Christ his Birth,
whereunto when we answer, that Christ in his Birth opened the womb of his
Mother, although without violation of her sacred vessel, we are therefore
presently branded by your Bellar. l^de notis Eccles. cap. 9. Sander. de visib.
Monarch. li. 7. page 321. Maldon. Ies. Com. in Luc. 2. 23.
Disputers with the black mark of the Heresy of those wicked Spirits, who
taught the Corruption of her Virginity. Which objection nothing but personal
malice could make, or Impudency defend, as the Obiecters themselves well knew,
one of them confessing, that diverse Fathers in interpreting that Scripture,
which is by the Evangelist applied to the Virgin Mary, and Birth of Christ,
viz. Every Male child that opens the womb shall be holy unto the Lord; did
teach that Docue^unt -- solum Christum aperuisse vulvam. Mald. in Luc 2.

reckons for this opinion these holy Fathers, Origin, Tertullian, Ambrose,
Gregory Nyssen, Epiphanius, Hierome, Theophylact, Eusebius. So he. A fair
company of fellow Heretics with Protestants, we trow: to whom the same
Jesuit joins diverse Doctors of your Romish Church, whom he calls Docti,
and Catholici. Thus your own spirit of Contradiction, whereas two words might
have quit the Heresy, maintained the Miracle, and defended the Integrity of
that sanctified womb of the Blessed Virgin, (to wit) that the Virginal cell
might be said to open it self, which was shut in respect of other women (who
necessarily suffer violent rupture by the birth) being preserved from all
hurtful violence, either from within or from without; which could not be
without a Miracle.

Furthermore hearken to the answer of some other Doctors of your Church, and
you shall find your own Doctrine to smell rank of the Heresy of the
Marcionites, in the opinion of the forecited ancient Fathers; for your
forenamed Apud Maldon. Ies. in Luc. 2. Id Patres dixisse ardore abreptos
disputationis co^tra Marcionitas, ne Christum corporeum phantasma facere
viderentur, si dixissent matris uterum non aperuisse.
Jesuit tells you of some Doctors in your Church (whom he himself
approves) who taught that The Fathers, who said that Christ did open the
Matrix of his Mother, speak it in the heat of Dispute against the Heretical
Marcionites, who denied that Christ had any true Body; because that else the
said Fathers should seem to make Christ his Body to be no better than an
Incorporeall, and only imaginary thing. So they. Which proves, that in the
judgment of those Ancient Fathers, all your defense, in this Case, is at least
Fantastical. Let Isiodore Pelusiota his suffrage be added to the rest, who in
an Epistle calmly, and as it were in a cool blood, teaches that Ibid.
Pelusiot. lib. 1. Epist. 23. Aperire vulvam (Luc. 2.) non dicitur de quovis
primogenito [(...).
Christ is the only he, who by his birth opened his Mothers womb, and left it
shut and sealed up again. And makes bold to term them unlearned, that
think the contrary: who living above a thousand years ago, is therefore so
much the more competent a witness of the Catholic truth.

As for the entrance of the Math. 19 24.
Camel, (which is said of Christ) to pass through the eye of a needle: the
subtilty of your Objection is not so needle-sharpe, but that it may be easily
blunted, for Christ spoke by way of comparison, and employed as well an
Impossibility as a Possibility, Thus; as it is simply Impossible for a Camel
(be it Rope, or be it Beast) to pass through the eye of a Needle, retaining
the same dimension and property: so is it Impossible for a Rich-man, so long as
he has on him a great Bunch or grossnes of confidence in his riches, and
wordly affections, to enter into the Kingdom of God. Although otherwise, as it
is possible for God, by his miraculous power so to contract the Camel, that it
may pass through the Needles eye; so is it as possible by his omnipotent power
of Grace to abate the swelling Bunch of worldly Confidence in the heart of the
Rich-man, that he, being truly mortified, may repose his whole trust in God
himself, and at length enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

CHALLENGE.
SHall not then the novelty of your Romish Article, which was not so much as
believed of Romish Doctors of this last Age of Christianity? Shall not your
Contradiction to your own Romish Principle? Shall not the express Testimony
of S. Augustine, who as he was universally acknowledged to be a Catholic
Father; so was he never condemned by any other Catholic Father for this his
Doctrine concerning the Existence of Bodily Parts according to proportionable
dimensions of Space? Finally, shall not the affinity, which your opinion bath
with damnable heresies, persuade you of the falsity of this your Romish Faith?

CHAP. VIII.
Of the fifth Romish Contradiction against the words of Christ [MY BODY] as the
same Body is now considered to be most perfect, by making it most Imperfect.

SECT. I.
NOne will think we need to impose any absurd Doctrine upon your Church; the
Absurdities which we have already heard professed therein, under the
testifications of your own Disputers, having been so marvailously and palpably
absurd, as has been shown. Among which we may reckon this, that follows,
as not the least prodigious Consequence of your Romish Corporal Presence (to
wit)

That your Church of Rome allows a Doctrine, teaching a Body of Christ, now
glorified, to be destitute of natural and voluntary motion of Sense, and of
Understanding.

SECT. II.
Catholic Faith never conceived otherwise of the humane nature of Christ,
after the Resurrection, but that he was able naturally of himself, as he was
man, to perform the perfect Acts, which other men can, who are of right
constitution of Body, and of sound understanding; such as are the functions of
Judgment, and reason, and of appetite, sense, and motion, according to the
liberty of his own will. This Doctrine was above 1000. years Catholic. But
your now Roman faith is to believe, as follows in the conclusions set down
by your Jesuit Suarez, Suarez. Ies. Dico secundo corpus Christi, ut est in hoc
Sacramento, potest per se moveri localiter a Deo: loquor de potentia Dei
absoluta. Nam iuxta legem statutam suppono corpus Christi nunquam separari a
speciebus, nec moveri nisi motis illis -- neque in hac conclusione invenies
Theologum ullum aperte contradicentem. In tertiam Tho. qu. 76 Art. 7. disp. 32.
Conc. 2. and Conclu^. 3. Corpus Christi ut est in hoc Sacramento non possit
naturaliter moverilocaliter ab intrinseco a propria anima, and interna virtute
motiua naturali, neque per se, neque per accidens. Loquor de naturali virtute,
non ut est instrumentum verbi operans per virtutem miraculorum effectricem.
Ratio, quia non potest anima movere corpus suum nisi per membra organica, quae
habent extensionem in locum: Sed membra corporis Christi non hoc modo existunt
in hoc Sacramento -- multo minus potest movere species Sacramenta^es, quas nec
physic^ contegere possit, neque ad motum voluntatis movere. Ibid. conclus. ult.
Potest ut est in hoc Sacramento virtute extrinseca moveri per Accidens, quia
possunt Sacramentales species moveri, vt a Sacerdote, Elevando. Sect. 3. De
sensibus exterioribus nominales ci^atidicunt posse Christum, ut est in hoc
Sacramento, ut Deum audire, etc. Alij hoc negant. Sunt nonnulli, quinegant id
fieri posse de Potentia Dei absoluta, ut corpus in extensum a loco aut seipsum
videat, autalia. Dico, non potest nat^raliter exercere actus sensuum
exteriorum; Ita tenet Thomas and alij Authors -- quia sensus cius non potest
recipere has species ab obiectis externis, quia hic actus est materialis, and
extensus suanatura -- Quamvis potentia absoluta potest -- Idem dicendum de
sensibus interioribus and appetitu sentiente, quia non uti phan^asmatibus, nec
actum secundum elicere, quia hic actus est materialis, and nisi a materiali and
extenso principio non potest intellectus eius, secl^so miraculo, -- acquirere
novas species, nec prius exquisitis uti, quia intellectus hoc non potest
facere, nisi simul phantasia operetur cum intellectu: non loquor de speciebus
infusis. Haec Suarez in 3. Tho. qu. 76. Art. 7. disp. 53.. 4. So also
Vincentius Silliuitius Senens. Ies. Moral. quaest. To. 1. Tract 4. 5. nu. 1 39.
and 141. Motus localis non convenit corpori per se, nec possunt actiones
sensuum convenire Christo naturaliter, quia hae exercentur, per species in
substantia divisibili. At Christi corpus est in sacramento indivisibiliter, etc.
without (as he says) the contradiction of any Divine in your Church. First,
that Christ, as he is in this Sacrament, has no power naturally of himself to
move himself. And this your own daily experience has brought you unto;
whilst believing Christ's Corporal presence in the Host, you shut him up in a
Box, where you still find the same lying as destitute of power of motion, as
any other unconsecrated Bread; which being put together with it lies so long,
until they both equally wax moldy, putrifye, and engender worms. Secondly,
that Christ in himself, as being in this Sacrament, has no natural faculty
of sense, nor ability (without a miracle) to hear or see, etc. Thirdly, That
he is void of all sensible appetite. Lastly, that (without some miraculous
power) he cannot possibly apprehend in his understanding any thing present, nor
yet remember any notions past. So he.

That this is a new, brutish, and barbarous Doctrine, destitute of all ancient
Patronage either of written or of unwritten Tradition.

SECT. III.
HAve you any Text, yea or yet pretext either of Scripture, or humane Tradition
for countenancing this so prodigious and monstrous a conception? Certainly
Scripture tells us, that Christ his Body by Resurrection is perfected in
sense, and Agility; and his soul in Judgment, and Capacity. Nor can you show
any Father in the Church of Christ within the Circumference of 1400. years
after Christ, who held this your doctrine so much as in a Dream* or who has
not esteemed the Body of Christ to be of the most absolute perfection: we say
no one Father, or Teacher of the Evangelicall Truth once fancied this
unchristian, and false faith. You must therefore derive this from him, whom
Christ calls the Father of lies. We shall give you good reason for this our
Declamation.

That this Romish Doctrine is blasphemously Derogatory from the Maiesticall
Body of Christ.

SECT. IV.
What is this, which we have heard? Christ his humanity* after his
Resurrection, not to have so much Capacity, as a Child? which is (as he is
here) to understand or imagine any thing done? not the power of a Moale, or
Mouse; which is to hear, or see? not the faculty of a little Aut, so as to
move it self? as if this were not an Antichristian blasphemy against that
all-Maiesticall Body, and humane nature of Christ: which being once 1. Cor. 15.
44.
sown in infirmity, is, (as the Scripture says) since risen in power. Do you
hear? In power, says the spirit of God, showing that Infirmity is changed
into Potencie, in the Body of every Christian: and you have turned power into
infirmity, even in Christ himself, whom you have now transformed into an
Psalm. 116.
Idol having eyes, and sees not, ears, and hears not, feet, and walks
not, heart, and imagines not: and yet this you profess to adore, as the
person of the Son of God. O the strength of Satanicall Delusion!

That this Romish Doctrine contradicts your own Principle.

SECT. V.
REmember your See above Chap. 4.. 10.
former general Principle, which we acknowledged to be sound and true, viz.
All such Actions, and Qualities, which are real in any Body without any
relation to place, cannot be said to be multiplied in respect of diverse places,
wherein a Body is supposed to be. As for Example: The Body of Christ cannot be
cold in one Altar, and hot in another, wounded, and whole, in joy, and grief,
dead, and alive at the same time. The reason. These are impossible (say you)
because of Contradiction: for, that the same thing should be capable of such
contrarieties, it is repugnant to the understanding of man. So you; which is an
infallible Truth, when the Modus, or Manner of a thing is compared to it self,
and not to any thing else: it is necessary that at one and the same time the
Modus be only one, the same Jesuit cannot be sick in Iapan, and sound and in
health at Rome, in the same instant.

CHALLENGE.
NOw say (we beseech you) is there not the like Contradiction to make the same
Christ at the same time, as he is in Heaven, intelligent, and sensitive; and
as on earth ignorant, and sensl^sse? Or powerful to move of himself, on the
throne of Majesty; and absolutely Impotent, as he is on the Altar? because
these Attributes, of Christ being Intelligent, and potent equally have no
Relation to place. Notwithstanding all which you shame not to profess a
senseless, ignorant, and feeble Christ. O come out of Babylon, and be no more
be witched by such her Sorceries!

CHAP. IX.
The sixth kind of Romish Contradiction against these words of Christ [MY BODY]
as it is now most Glorious, by making it most Inglorious.

SECT. I.
BEfore we proceed in discovering the ouglinesse of the Romish Doctrine in this
point, we are willing to hear your In his Book of the Liturgy of the Mass
Tract. 2.. 4. Subd. 1.
Master Brerely his preface in your defense: The carnal man (says he) is not
for all this satisfied, but stands still offended at sundry pretended absurd,
and undecent indignities: Calvin saying, That he rejected them as unworthy of
the Majesty of Christ, And Doctor Willet says: That they are unseemely, and
against the dignity of the glorious and impassible Body of Christ. So he, at
once relating, and rejecting their opinions.

That the Indignities, whereunto the Body of Christ is made subject, by the
Romish Doctrine, are most uile, and derogatory to the Majesty of Christ.

SECT. II.
ALl Christian Creeds tell us, that Christ our Savior sits at the right
hand of God, that is, in perfection of glory. But your Jesuit Suarez
delivers it in the general Doctrine of the Romish Divines; Suarez Ies.

Missals. We thirdly demand whether you think it possible for meat, that is
undigested by reason of man's infirmity, to descend raw through the Body into
the Draught (which in other meats is known sometime to be certain:) you
falling into this speculation, tell us concerning the Egestion, that it is held
A muribus comeditur, quia Denominationes, qua tantum indicant motum local^m per
terminum ^ius, proprietribuuntur corpori Christi, a quocunque fiant, huiusmodi
est commestio. Suarez Tom. 3. qu. 76. Disp. 54. p. 706.
Probable that the Body of Christ does not pass with the forms into the
Draught in that Case. So you: affirming this to be but only Probable, whereas
whosoever shall teach that the Body of Christ is not severed from the form of
Bread, so long as it is incorrupt (which is your Si autem species illae
transeant per stomachum indigestae, per aliquam infirmitatem, tunc sunt extia

general Tenet) they must hold that the same Body in the like case of man's
bodily infirmity does pass by Egestion in like sort into the seege. For if (as
you do also say) the same Body of Christ has been once hidden in a See above
in this Book Chap. 1. Sect. 2.
Dunghill, why may you not as wickedly believe, that it may pass into the
Draught?

That the Romish foresaid Indignities are contrary to holy Scriptures, and
judgment of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. III.
HOly Writ teaches us, that there is as great difference between the
humiliation of Christ, when he was on earth, and his now Exaltation in glory,
in Heaven, as there is between Shame, and Glory, it being now 1. Cor. 15.
Philip. 2 8, 9.
[(...)] A Body of Glory. Now for you to believe and profess the personal
burning, devouring, regorging, yea and the hiding of that glorious Body of
Christ in a dung hill, and the like, are such execrable speeches, as that we
stand astonished with horror to hear them, thinking that we have heard, in
these, the scoffs, reproaches, and blasphemies of some Pagans against
Christian Religion, rather than the opinion of any, that take to themselves one
syllable of the name of Christians.

If this had been the ancient Faith, some Fathers doubtless upon some
occasion, by some one sentence or other would have revealed their Judgment
therein: from whose diverse and copious Volumes neither do you allege, nor we
read any one word of man's spewing up, or Mice eating, or so much as the wind
blowing away the Body of Christ; much less of the other baseness spoken of.

of Christ, and the Bread Sacramental, say That not that Body, but this Bread
goes into the Draught. Which to affirm of Christ's Body, were an Assertion
abominable.

That the Romish Answers, for defense of this their vile and beastly Opinion,
are but false and fond.

SECT. IV.
IT was said of Philosophers of old that nothing was so absurd, but some one or
other of them would take in hand to defend it: the like may be said of our
Romish Opposites, whereof we have given you diverse Instances throughout this
whole Treatise, as in the most particulars, so for the point now in Question.
And although many of your Disputers have for modesties sake passed by it, yet
have two among you (as it were putting on Vizards on their faces) come in with
two fanaticall Card. Bellar. and Master Brerely in places above cited.
Answers. Both which are taken from the condition of Christ his humane Body,
whilst he was in the world: Non nulli vix far possunt Christum quoque modo
includi in parva pixide, cadere in terram, comburi, rodi a bestia -- Annon'
credunt Christum parvulum inclusum in angustissimo utero? cundem potuisse in
via cadere, humi jacuisse, and remoto miraculo a bestia morderi and comburi
potuuisle? si ita pati potuit in propria specie, cur mirum videtur si illa sine
laesione in specie aliena eidem accidere posse dicamus? Bellar. lib. 3. de
Euch. c. 10. Denique.
Many (says your Cardinal) can scarce endure to hear that Christ is included
in a Box, fallen to the earth, burnt, or eaten of beasts: as though we do not
read, that Christ was included in the womb of the Virgin, lay upon the earth,
and might without any miracle have been eaten of beasts, why may not such
things now happen unto him, but [sine laesione] without any hurt at all? So he.

Join with this the Determination of your Aquinas. Etiamsi canis hostiam
consecrata^ manducet, substa^tia corporis Christi non desinit esse sub
speciebus, part. 3. qu. 80. art. 3.
School; That the substance of Christ his Body remains still, although the
Host be eaten with Dogs. But Master Brerely more cunningly, that he might not
disguise your opinions, but also make Protestants odious, (if it might be) for
their exceptions against them, does readily tell us, that Pagans, Jews, and
Heretics conceived Indignities against some mysteries of Christian Religion,
as against Christ his Incarnation, and his Crucifying. So he. Both which
Answers are but mere tergiversations, by confounding the two most different
conditions of Christ: That, then in the state of his humiliation, with This,
which is Now in the highest exaltation of Glory. We therefore reioyne, as
follows.

Your Disputers have so answered, as if Christ his Incarnation in the womb of
a Virgin, his Conversation upon earth, and his Passion upon the Cross were not
objects of Indignity, notwithstanding the Spirit of God, has blazed them to
the world to have been the Indignities of all Indignities, Thus: Phil. 2. 6.
Who being in the form of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equal with
God, yet [(...)] made himself of no reputation, but took upon him the form
of a servant (such was his Incarnation) and became obedient to death, even
(spoken for aggravating the Indignity thereof) The [shamefull] death of the
Cross. Than which never any thing could make more either for the magnifying of
Gods grace, and mercy, or for the dignifying of Christ his merit for man, as it
is written Ioh. 3. 16.
God so loved the world, that he sent his Son, (namely to suffer) that
whosoever should believe in him should not perish, but have life everlasting.
How could your Answerers but know, that it was not the observation of the
indignities, which Christ suffered, that wrought to the condemnation of Pagans,
Jews, and Heretics: but their faithlessenesse in taking such scandal
thereat, as to deprive themselves, by their Infidelity, of all hope of life by
Christ crucified. Hearken furthermore.

That the state of Christ his Humanity cannot be now obnoxious to bodily
Indignities; and that the comparing both the Estates (in your answering) is
unworthy the learning of very Catechumenists and Petties in Christian Religion.

SECT. V.
THis Disproportion between Christ his estate in the days of his flesh in
this world, and his now present Condition at the right hand of God, is as
extremely disproportionable as is 1. Cor. 15.
Mortality, and Immortality, Shame and Glory, Misery and Blessedness, Earth and
Heaven; that being his state of humiliation, and this contrariwise of his
exaltation, as all Christians know, and profess. And although the Body of
Christ now in eternal Majesty be not obnoxious to Corporal injuries, yet may
Moral and Spiritual abasements be offered unto Christ, as well in the
Opinion, as in the Practice of men. Of the opinion we have an Example in the
Capernaites concerning Christ, whenever he should give his flesh to be eaten
carnally: for the Practice you may set before you the Corinthians, who abusing
the Sacrament of the Lord did thereby contemn him, and were made guilty of
high Profanation against the glorious Body of Christ. And what else sounds
that Relative injury against Christ, by murdering his Saints on earth,
complained off by his voice from Heaven; Act. 9. 4.
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

Your Cardinal, in answer to the Objection of Indignity offered to Christ, by
putting him in a Box, and of being Eaten with Worms, and the like; opposed
(as you have heard) saying, Why may not such things now happen unto him but
[sine laesione] that is, without any hurt? We answer that if he should suffer
nothing in his humanity passively to the Laesio corporis, that is, hurt of the
Body; yet should there be thereby, in the opinion of men, laesio dignitatis,
that is a lessening and obscuring of that his dignity, which is set forth in
Scripture, and which our Article of faith, concerning his Bodily sitting at the
Right hand of God in Heaven, teaches us to be in all Celestial glory and
Majesty. This your Aquinas well saw, when in regard of Indignity he judged it
Nefas nunc esset Christum in propria specie in pixide includi putare. Aquin.
part. 3. quest. 76. art. 8.
An heinous wickedness for any to think Christ should be enclosed in a Box,
appearing in his proper form. And what greater difference can it be for a Body
to be Boxed under another form, more than when that one, and the same Person
is imprisoned, whether open faced, or covered, whether in the day, or in the
night, it mattereth not much, for still the same person is shut up in Prison?
Again, if that these Circumstances now spoken of were not Arguments of
Indignity, why do your Jesuits, in a point of Opinion, deny that Christ's
Body is Transubstantiated into the flesh of the Communicant, because of the Sea
hereafter Book 5. Chap. 7. Sect. 1.
Indignity against his Majesty.

Come we to the point of Practice. Let this be our lesson; when there is
Reverence in the use of a thing, then there may be Irreverence, and Indignity
in the abuse thereof. But your Church has provided that the Priests be shaven,
and the Laics abstain from the Cup in a pretense of Reverence. The first,
least some part of the Host (which you believe to be the body of Christ)
should hang on the Priest's Beard; the second, least any whit of Christ's Blood
in the Cup should be split. But how much more indignity must it needs be to be
devoured of Mice, Worms, and sometimes (as your own See above in this Book
Chap. 2. Sect. 2.
stories have related) kept close in a Dunghill? One word more. If these seem
not sufficiently indigne, because there is not Laesio corporis; Hurt of the
Body (this being your only Evasion) what will you say of your framing a Christ
unto your selves, who as he is in this Sacrament, Is (you say) without power of
motion of sense, and of understanding? Why, my Masters, can there be Lamenesse,
Blindness, Deafness, and Impotencie it self, without Hurt of the same
party so maimed? etc. This is worse than your dirty imagination of placing him
in a Dunghill.

THE GENERAL CHALLENGE.
THese above specified Six Contradictions so plainly and plentifully proved by
such forceable Arguments as the light of Divine Scripture has authorized, the
profession of Primitive Fathers testified, Confessions of Romish Doctors
acknowledged, and the Principles of your own Romish learning in most points
confirmed; your Abrenunciation of your so many Gross Errors may be as
necessary, as your persisting therein will be damnable. Before we can end, we
are to consult with the Fathers of the Council of Nice, especially seeing that
as well Romanists as Protestants will be known to appeal to that Council.

CHAP. X.
Of the Canon of the Council of Nice, objected for proof of a Corporal
Prescnce of Christ in the Eucharist.

SECT. I.
THis (as it is delivered by your Concilij verba. Iterum etiam hic in divina
mensa ne humiliter intenti simus ad propositum pane^ and calicem, sed
attollentes mentem fide intelligamus situm in sacra illa mensa agnu^ illum Dei

pretiosum eius corpus and sanguinem vere nos sumentes, credamus haec esse
nostrae resurrectionis symbola. Propter hoc enim neque mulcum accipimus, sed
parum, ut sciamus, non ad satietatem, sed ad sanctificationem offerri, Vt
resert Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 10.
Cardinal, taken out, as he says, of the Vatican Library) stands thus: Let
us not here in this divine Table be in humbleness intent unto the Bread, and
Cup which is set before us, but lifting up our minds let us understand by faith
the Lamb of God set upon that Table: The Lamb of God, which takes away the
sins of the World, offered unbloodily of the Priest. And we receiving truly
his Body and Blood, let us think these to be the Symbols of our Resurrection.
For this Cause do we receive not much, but little, that we may understand
this is not to satisfy, but to sanctify. So the Canon.

The General approbation of this Canon by Both sides.

SECT. II.
SCarce is there any one Romish Author, handling this Controversy, who does
not fasten upon this Canon of Nice, for the countenancing of your Romish Mass.
Contrarily Protestants (as they are set down by our Hunc canonem Conc. Niceni
probatum fuisse Marpurgi Luthero, and alijs. -- Martinus Bucerus dixit; Ita in
Domino sentio: and in hac sententia opto venire ad Tribunal Dei. Manu mea

Bellarmine) in great numbers (among whom are Luther and Calvin) with joint
consent approve of this Canon; one of them (Bucer by name) subscribing unto it
with his own hand, in these words: So I think in the Lord, and I wish to
appear in this mind before the Tribunal Seat of God. So they. The right
Explication of this Canon will be worthy our pains.

The state of the Difference, concerning this Canon.

SECT. III.
THis (as is propounded by your Cardinal) stands thus. Per Agnum omnes
intelligunt Christum, ut distinguitur contra symbola. Bellar quo supra. -- Illi
(Protestants) quasi admoneant, ne quaerendum Christum in Altati lapideo. Sed
mente conscendamus ad coelum, in coelo situm Agnum. -- At vult Concilium, ut ad
sacram ipsam mesam attendamus: sed in ipsa non tam Symbola, quam quae sub illis
latent consideremus. Ibidem per totum.
All (says he) by the Lamb understand Christ as he is distinguished from the
Symbols and Signs upon the Altar. Next. But the Protestants think (says he)
that the Council admonishes not to seek Christ on the Altar, but to ascend
up unto him in Heaven by faith, as sitting at the right hand of God. But we all
say (says he) that the Council would have us to attend unto the holy Table
(meaning the Altar below) yet so, that we see in it not so much the outward
Symbols, and Signs, as that which lies hid under them, viz. The Body and
Blood of Christ. So he. The difference then between him and us is no less
than the distance between Aloft and Under, that is, between Heaven above, and
Earth below. Let us set forward in our progress, but with easy, and even
paces; to the end you may better understand the strength of our Proofs, and
rottenness of your Objections.

That the Nicene Council is marvellously prejudicial to your Romish Defense:
proved by five Observations; Three here.

SECT. IV.
FIve points are chiefly observable in this Canon. First is the nomination of
Bread. Secondly, the mention of two Tables. Thirdly, the admonition to lift up
our minds. Fourthly, the expression of the Reason thereof. Fifthly, the
Confirmation of the same Reason.

First, That, which the Council would that men be not too intent unto, they
call Bread after Consecration; for the Error, which they would have avoided,
was either the too much abasing of this Sacrament (according to your Cardinals
Iubet Concilium ut non inhaereamus speciebus panis and vini; quasi ibi nihil
sit, nisi quod oculi renu^tiant. Bellar. quo supra.
Gloss) and then was it after Consecration, because they needed not to have
persuaded any to have too mean an estimation of the Bread unconsecrated; which
you your selves hold to be a common and profane thing: or else the Error must
have been (as indeed it was) too high a valuation of the outward Element of
Bread, which must needs be so, because it was consecrated, and notwithstanding
it being so consecrated, in the Canon it is called Bread. which your Fathers of
the Council of Trent would not have endured, especially seeing that we find
that your Nic. Cabasila. Latini dicunt eos, qui panem and vinum nominant, and
tanquam nondum sanctificatis precantur sanctificationem post illa verba [Hoc
est corpus meum] rem supervacuam facere. Expos. Liturg. cap. 29.
Latin Church was offended with the late Greek Church, for calling the parts
of the Eucharist by the terms of Bread and Wine after the pronunciation of
these words [This is my Body,] by you called the words of Consecration. Besides
they so call them Bread and Wine, as they name them Symbols and Signs, which
properly they could not be, until after Consecration.

Secondly, the (...), etc. -- (...). Conc. Nicen.
Canon expressly notes and distinguishes two Tables, in respect of place; the
one, as Here; being as much as to say, This Table: and the other opposed
hereunto is instiled, That Table. And, of this Table Here, the Council
forbids Christians to look Too attentively to the thing set before us: But
contrarily, concerning That other Table, they command men to Lift up their
minds aloft. And not thus only, but they also distinguish them in respect of
their different Objects. The Object of the First Table, Here, they name Bread,
and the Cup; the objects of sense: And the other object, opposed to this, is
that on the other Table, expressed to be the Lamb of God, the object of our
minds.

Thirdly, the Admonition or Caution, which the Council gives concerning the
Bread, is, not to be too intent to it: but touching the Lamb of Christ, they
command us to lift up our minds aloft; for so the word (...).
[(...)] does signify, not to be used (we think) for an inward looking into
the sublimity of the mystery of the matter before us, as your Cardinal
fancieth: but for looking up aloft unto the Lamb of God in Heaven, according
to the Catholic fence of those words, See hereafter Book 7. Chap. 4. Sect. 7.
SVRSVM CORDA!

The next two proofs out of the same Canon of Nice, to manifest our Protestant
profession touching the question in hand.

Our next two proofs out of the Canon are these. First is their Reason of the
former Caution: the Second, the Confirmation of that Reason: both are expressly
set down in the Canon it self. Why then did those holy Fathers admonish us
not to be too intent to the Bread and Wine set before us? It follows; Because
they are not ordained to satisfy our natural man, namely, by a full eating
and Drinking: but for a Sacramental participation of the Body, and Blood of
Christ, to the sanctifying of our souls: whereas your Church does attribute to
that, which you eat in this Sacrament, a power of sanctifying the Body by it is
Bodily touch. But much more will the next proof undermine your defense.

To confirm their Reason, why the Sacrament was not ordained for the
satisfying of the natural man, they add saying; For this cause we receive not
much, but little: which one Clause most evidently proves it to be spoken of
Bread and Wine; and not of the Body, and Blood of Christ. As your general
Roman Catechism (if you have not already learned it) will now teach you to
believe, saying that Catechis. Romans Christum Dominum esse in hoc Sacrame^to non
dicimus, ut parvus aut magnus est, sed ut substantia est. Tract. de Euch. number.
36.
Christ is not great or small in this Sacrament. And indeed none ever said of
the Eucharist, that he eat a little of Christ's Body, or a little Christ, but
yet the Sacrament eaten is sometimes more, sometime less. Nor this only, but
the Canon furthermore speaks of taking a little of that, whereof if much were
taken (says it) it might satiate the natural man. So the Canon. But that the
outward Sacrament can truly satisfy the natural man, you your selves will
testify in your Booke-Cases and Missals, See the fifth Book Chap. 6. Sect. 1.
and 2.
acknowledging men Drunk with the Sacrament, even unto vomiting with the one
part thereof; and also making mention of Men, and Mice being fed and nourished
with the other. So then the natural man may be satiated with this Sacrament;
but with what therein? The Body and Blood of Christ? you abhor to think
that; with Accidents? You may be ashamed to affirm it, as from the Judgment
of Antiquity, seeing you were never able hitherto justly to produce one Father
for proof of the Existence of Accidents without their Subjects: or of
nourishing a substance by mere Accidents. Wherefore until you can prove some
one of all these, give us leave to believe, that all were of the mind of that
one Gregor. Nyssen. Quomodo enim res incorporea corpori cibus fiat? In Orat. de
vita Mosis, p. 509.
Father, who held it Impossible for an Incorporeall, or not-bodily thing to be
food to a bodily substance. And so much the rather, because the Fathers have
manifoldly See above Book 3. Chapter 3. Sect. 7. and 10. etc.
acknowledged in this Sacrament, after Consecration, the substance of Bread.
Wherefore the Reasoning of the Council, touching the Eucharist, was like as if
one should say of Baptism; We take not too much, but little, lest it might be
thought to have been ordained not for a Sacramental means of sanctifying the
Soul, but for the clensing of the Flesh. None is so stupid as not to
understand, by Much and Little, the substance of water.

And if you shall need a further Explication of the same sentence of the
Fathers of Nice, you may fetch it from the Fathers in another Council held at
Toledo in Spain, Anno 693. who show this Reason, why they Conc. Tolet. 16.
Anno 693. Can. 6. Integrum panem esse sumendum -- nequo grande allquid, sed
modica tantum oblato, secundum id quod Ecclesiastica consuetudo retentat: cuius
reliquiae aut ad conservandum modico loculo absque aliqua iniuria Sacrificijs
co^secretur; aut si sum endum fuerit necessarium, non ventrem illius, qui
sumpserit, gravis sarciminis onere premat, nec quid indigestice vadat, sed
animum alimonia spirituali reficiat.
Take little portions of the Host (namely, say they) least otherwise the belly
of him that takes this Sacrament may be stuffed, and overcharged; and least
it may pass into the Draught, but that it may be nourishment for the soul.
Hereby plainly teaching, concerning the consecrated matter, that were it so
much as could burden the belly, it would through the superfluity thereof go
into the Draught: whereas, if Less, it would serve as well, or better for a
Sacramental use, to the replenishing of our souls in the spiritually
receiving of the Body of Christ. But you are not so far bereft of your wits
as to imagine that Much, which stuffeth, and after passes into the Draught, to
be Christ's Body; and you may swear that the Fathers meant not mere See
above Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 10.
Accidents. For mere Accidents have not the property of Substance, through the
Muchnesse thereof, either to satiate the natural appetite, in feeding, or to
over-charge the Belly by weight, in pressing it down to the Draught. Never did
any Father father such an Imagination. What can be, if this be not true
reasoning, and consequently a full confuration of your Roman Faith. Therefore
this one Canon of Nice being thus undoubtedly gained, concerning the not
seeking Christ, Here, on this Table, is sufficient of it self to batter down
your Assertion by a five-fold force. First, by proof of no Transubstantiation
of Bread; Secondly, no Corporal Presence of Christ's Body; Thirdly, no
Corporal Conjunction with the Bodies of the Communicants; and (consequently)
Fourthly, no proper Sacrifice thereof; And lastly, no Divine Adoration due unto
it. Therefore ought you to bid all these your Romish Doctrines and Delusions
avaunt.

Your Objections, from the former Canon, answered.

SECT. V.
FIrst you Ob. 1. Cum dicit agnum Dei sicum esse in sacra mensa, and eundem
agnum opponit symbolis, declarat agnu^ proprie esse in mensa: and non solum ut
per symbola repraesentatur. 2. Agnus dicitur a Sacerdotum manibus immolari,
quod non fit in coelo: neque enim tam lo^gas manus habent Sacerdotes, ut ad

cord sed and corpore sumitur, prebatur: quia corpus and sanguis Domini
dicuntur esse nostrae resurrectionis symbola, quia cum nostris corporibus
co^iunguntur. Si autem sola esset animorum coniunctio, solus animus
resurrecturus significaretur. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 10.
Object, that The Lamb is said to be placed on the Table, mistaking what Table
is meant; for the Canon specifying two Tables, one Here, which is of the
Eucharist, and another That Table, namely in Heaven, says that Christ is
placed on That Table, according to our Faith of his sitting at the right hand
of God in Heaven. Secondly, he is said (say you) to be sacrificed by the hands
of the Priest; which cannot be done, as he is in Heaven. The words of the
Canon, truly resolved, do cashiere this Objection, as thus: The Lamb of God
set at that Table (namely in Heaven) is sacrificed by the hands of the Priest
Here, to wit, on the Table below (representatively) as hereafter the Catholic
Fathers themselves will show. And these two may easily consist, without any
necessity of the Priest reaching his hands as far as the highest Heavens; as
your Cardinal pleasantly obiecteth. Thirdly, you allege; We are said to
partake truly of the Body of Christ. As though there were not a Truth in a
Sacramental, that is Figurative Receiving; and more especially (which See
above Chap. 1. Sect. 2.
has been both proved, and confessed) a Real, and true participation of
Christ's Body and Blood spiritually, without any Corporal Conjunction.

But it is added (says he) that These (namely, the Body and Blood of Christ)
are Symbols of our Resurrection; which is by reason that our Bodies are joined
with the Body of Christ: otherwise if our Conjunction were only of our souls,
only the Resurrection of our souls should be signified thereby. So he,
that is to say, as successesly as in the former.

For the word, HAEC, These, (which are called Symbols of our Resurrection) may
be referred either to the Body and Blood of Christ, immediately spoken of, and
placed on the Table in Heaven (which we Commemorate also in the Celebration of
this Sacrament) and in that respect may be called Symbols of the Resurrection
of our Bodies: because, 1. Cor. 1. 15.
If Christ be risen, then must they that are Christ's also rise again. Or else
the word, These, may have relation to the more remote (after the manner of the
Greeks) to wit, Bread and Cup on the first Table, because (as immediately
follows) they are these whereof not much, but little is taken; as you have
heard. Which other See below Book 5. Chap. 8. Sect. 6.
Fathers will show to be indeed Symbols of our Resurrection, without any
Consequence of Christ's Bodily Conjunction with our Bodies, more than there is
by the Sacrament of Baptism, which they call the Earnest of our Resurrection;
as does also your Jesuit Ad futuram resurrectione^, per Baptismi Sacramentum,
ius and pignus accepimus. Coster. Institut. Christ. l. 4. c. 4 See more in the
Book following. Chap. 8. Sect. 6.
Coster call it The Pledge of our Resurrection. (But this our Conjunction with
Christ is the subject matter of the Fifth Book.) Lastly, how the Eucharist was
called of the Fathers a Sacrifice, is plentifully resolved in Chap. 5. Sect.
the Sixth Book.

THE FIFTH BOOK,
Treating of the third Romish Doctrinall Consequence, arising from your
depraved Sense of the Words of Christ's Institution [THIS IS MY BODY:]
concerning the manner of the present Union of his Body with the bodies of the
Receivers, by Eating, etc.

CHAP. I.
The state of the Question.

SECT. I.
A Christian man consisting of two men, the Outward, or bodily; and the Inward,
which is, Spiritual; this Sacrament, accordingly, consists of two parts,
Earthly and Heavenly: as Irenaeus spoke of the bodily Elements of Bread and
Wine, as the visible Signs and Objects of Sense; and of the Body and Blood of
Christ, which is the Spiritual part. Answerable to both these is the double
nourishment and Union of a Christian; the one Sacramental, by communicating of
the outward Elements of Bread and Wine, united to man's body, in his Taking,
Eating, digesting, till at length it be transubstantiated into him, by being
substantially incorporated in his flesh. The other, which is the Spiritual,
and Souls food, is the Body and Blood of the Lord (therefore called
Spiritual, because it is the Object of Faith) by an Union wrought by God's
Spirit, and man's faith; which (as has been professed by Protestants) is most
Real and Ineffable.

But your Church of Rome teaches such a Real Union of Christ his Body and
Blood with the Bodies of the Communicants, as is Corporal; which you call [Per
contactum] by Bodily touch, so long as the forms of Bread and Wine remain
incorrupt in the bodies of the Receivers.

Our Method requires that we first manifest our Protestant Defense of Union to
be an Orthodoxe truth. Secondly, to impugn your Romish Union, as
Capernaiticall (that is) Heretical. And thirdly, to determine the Point, by
comparing them both together. Our Orthodoxe Truth will be found in the
Preparations following.

That Protestants prosesse not only a Figurative and Sacramental Participation
and Communion with Christ's Body; but also a spiritually- Real.

SECT. II.
ALl the Books of the Adversaries to Protestants are most especially vehement,
violent, and virulent in traducing them in the name of Sacramentaries, as
though we professed no other manner of feeding and Union with Christ's body
than only Sacramental, and Figurative. For Confutation of which Calumny it
will be most requisite to oppose the Apology of Calvin. in hijs libris, vz.

Him, who has been most opposed and traduced by your Disputers in this Cause:

I do abhor your gross Doctrine of Corporal Presence. And Signum tantum

I have an hundred times disclaimed the receiving only of a Figure, in this

Our Catechism teaches (says he) not only a signification of the Benefits
of Christ to be had herein, but also a participation of the substance of
Christ's flesh in our souls. And with Swinckfeldius, maintayning only a
Figurative perception, we have nothing to do. If you further demand what is
the Feeding, whereby we are united to Christ's body, in this Sacrament? he
tells you that it is (IV.) Not carnal, but Spiritual, and Real; and so Real,
that the soul is as truly replenished with the lively virtue of his flesh, by
the powerful work of the Spirit of God; as the body is nourished with the
corporal Element of Bread in this Sacrament. If you exact an Expression of
this spiritual Union, to know the manner, he acknowledges it to be Ergo in
coena miraculum agnoscimus, quod and naturae sines, and sensus nostri modum
exsuperat: quod Christi caro nobis fit communis, and nobis in alimentum datur.
-- Modus incomprehensibilis.

If further you desire to understand, whether he were not Singular in this
opinion, he has avouched the judgment of other Protestants, professing not to
dissent one Syllable from the Si nos in consensu, quem continet Augustana

Augustane Confession, as agreeing with him in judgment herein. Accordingly
our Church of England (in the 28. Article) says that To such as worthily, and
with faith receive this Sacrament, The Bread which we break is a partaking of
the Body of Christ, which Body is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only
after a spiritual and heavenly manner, the mean whereby is Faith.

That the Body of Christ, by this Sacrament, was ordained only for food to the
Christian man's Soul.

SECT. III.
What need we seek into the Testimonies of ancient Fathers, which are many,
in this point of Dispute, having before us the Judgment of your Summus

Decree.

That the Spiritual feeding and Union with Christ's Body is more excellent and
Real than the Corporal Conjunction can be.

SECT. IV.
THe soul of man being the most essential and substantial part of man
(because a Spirit immortal) and the flesh of Christ being the most
substantial of all food; and therefore called, as of ancient Ambros. lib. 5.

Trent, Supersubstantiall Bread; it must necessarily follow, that as it is
named by Christ Jo^. 6. 32.
The true Bread, and the Life thereby (which is the effect of the spiritual
Eating thereof) is the most true and Real Life, because Everlasting: So the
Union spiritual, which a Christian has in his soules-feeding, is the most
Real and true Union, as may sufficiently appear by Analogy. To wit, that
Bread and Wine being the most vital nourishments, for the conservation of
man's bodily essence, are therefore chosen (as the Fathers teach) to represent
and exhibit unto him (although, in themselves, but Signs and Symbols) the very
Body and Blood of Christ. Therefore the Body and Blood of Christ are our Real
nourishments in this Sacrament.

And such as is our food, such must be our Union, by feeding thereon; which we
say is by Faith, in this Sacrament: and you may not gainsay it, who, to
comfort your Disciples, are Alanus, and alij ex citatis Authoribus dicunt,
quando re-ipsa non potest suscipi hoc Sacramentum, ad perficiendam hanc

taught to instruct them, that even without this Sacrament the spiritual Union
may be presented to the soul of man, with the Body of Christ; and that as a
sufficient means of uniting him to Christ, by a spiritual manner of Eating.
And this (you say) is To receive Christ his Body truly; albeit this be to
receive him only by faith and desire. So you. Whence you perceive our
Inference, viz. If our spiritual Union with Christ his Body may be really and
truly made by Faith, and Desire, without this Sacrament: then, in our
Sacramental eating thereof, may the Communicant be much more made partaker
thereof by Faith and ardent Desire; the Sacrament it self being a Seal of
this our Christian Faith.

CHAP. II.
That only the Godly faithful Communicants are Partakers of the Body and
Blood of Christ; and thereby united to Christ, in the judgment of Protestants.

SECT. I.
Our Church of England in her 28. and 29. Article says thus: The Body of
Christ is given to be eaten in this Sacrament only after a spiritual manner,
even by faith: wherein the wicked, and such as are void of faith, eat it not;
although they do visibly press with their teeth the Sacraments of the Body
and Blood of Christ, yet are they in no wise Partakers thereof. But your Romish
Church flatly otherwise, as you all know; and therefore has your Sympresbyter
Master M. Brerely Tract. 2. Sect. 5. Sub. 2.
Brereley endeavored to assume some Protestants to be on your side, whom he
has alleged with like faithfulness, as he has cited Master Calvin: then
whom he could not have, in this case, a greater Adversary. For although Calvin
grant, with all Protestants, that the wicked and faithless receive truly, by
way of Sacrament, the Body of Christ; yet does he deny that they have in their
bodies any Corporal conjunction or Union with Christ, because the Union, which
we have ( Calvin. Epist. 372. ^et in the same Epistle he says of Papists,
Da^nantur, qui dicunt Iuda^ non minus corporis Christi participem fuisse, quam
Petrum. In his Institut. lib. 4. c. 17. Non alia quam fidei manducatio.. 8.

says he) is Only spiritual; only with the soul; only with the heart; only
by faith: and although it be offered to the wicked, to be really received, yet
do they not receive it, because they are Carnal. Their only Receiving
therefore is but Sacramental. So Mr. Calvin.

It had been good that your Priest had suspected his Judgment, and (as well
in this Case, as in others) by doubting his own eyesight had borrowed your
Sextum eorum Pronunciatum est, Improbos non suscipere corpus Christi, licet

Cardinal his Spectacles: then would he have clearly perceived that (together
with other Protestants) Calvin held that The wicked, although they receive the
Symbols and outward Signs of Christ's body, yet the body it self they do not
receive. So your Cardinal, of the Doctrine of Protestants. For although,
indeed, Calvin said that The wicked eat the Body of Christ: yet, explaining
himself, he added these two words [In Sacramento, that is, Sacramentally;]
which in Calvin's style is always taken for Symbolically only. As for the
consent of Protestants herein, we put it to your great Cardinal and Champion,
their greatest Adversary, to express. Ex Vbiquitistarum opinione sequitur
corpus Christi non posse veremanducari ore corporali, sed solum ore spirituali
per fidem: est ipsissima sententia Sacr^mentariorum. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch c.
17.. Secundo ex.
He joins Lutherans to the Calvinists in one consent, for denying the Orall
and Corporal Eating thereof; and for believing the Eating of it to be Only by
Faith. Yet left any may say, that in receiving the same Sacrament he does not
receive the thing signified thereby; you may have a Similitude to illustrate
your judgments, as thus: The same outward word, concerning Justification by
Christ, comes to the ears of both Unbelievers and Believers. But the
Believers only are capable of Justification.

That only the Godly-faithfull are Partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ,
and thereby United unto him; in the judgment of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. II.
CHrist, speaking of that which is the most Real Eating, says Ioh. 6. [He
that eats me remains in me, and shall live for ever.] Upon which Text Saint
Hierome concludes; Hieron. in Malach. 1. Immundi mu^dissimum sanguinem bibunt.
[But only Sacramentally, for it goes before in the same place;] Quando
Sacramenta violantur, is, cuius sunt Sacramenta, violatur. But Hier. in Esa.
66. Omnes magis amatores voluptatis, quam amatores Dei; dum non su^at sancti
corpore and spiritu: nec com^dunt carnem Christi, nec bibunt eius sanguinem.
The men that live in pleasure neither eat the flesh of Christ, nor drink his
Blood. Next, Origin infers that Orig. in Matthew. 15. Verbum, caro fa^tum,
verus cibus, que^ qui comedit vive^ i^ aeternum: quem nullus malus potest
edere. -- alioqui nequaquam* scriptum ^uisset, [Quisquis ederit, vivet in
aeternum.]
No wicked man can eat Christ his flesh. And Saint Augustine most peremptorily;
Aug. Tract. 59. in Ioh. Illi manducaba^t panem Dominum, Judas autem panem
Domin^. [Responde^ Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 13. Judas non utiliter edebat,
sicut qui panem comedit, reijci^ rursus, dicitur non comedere. [But it is
plain, that Saint Augustine distinguishes Signum a signato, and says; Judas
did not eat Panem Dominum.] Et Tract. 26. being constant to himself upon these
words; [Qui ma^ducat carnem meam, in me manet:] Qui non manet in Christo^
proculdubio non ma^ducat spiritualem carnem eius nec bibit eius sanguinem,
licet carnaliter and visibiliter premat dentibus Sacramentum tantae rei, and
iudi^ium sibi manducet. To the same purpose Cyril. Alex. lib. 10. in Ioh. c.
13. Sola membra Christi comedunt carnem Christi.
Without doubt (says he) they do not spiritually eat the flesh of Christ,
nor drink his blood, although that they do visibly and carnally press the
Sacrament thereof with their teeth, and notwithstanding eat their
condemnation. So he, thereby distinguishing the inward souls Eating Spiritual
from the outward and Sacramental Eating; as he does man's Spirit from his
Teeth. In which respect he as verily denied that Indas ate his Lord the bread,
as he affirmed him to have eaten The bread of the Lord. Therefore the Bread
Sacramental was not the Bread the Lord. Idem Cyril. Alex. lib. 4. in Ioh.
(Citante Sudrez. Tom. 3. qu 79. Disp. 64. Sect. 3.) Sicuti enim si quis
liquefactae cerae aliam ceram infuderit, al^eram cum altera per totum
commisceat necesse est: ita si quis carnem and sangui^^m Domini recipit, cum
ipso ita coniungitur, ut Christus in eo and ipse in Christo inveniatur.
Cyrill Bishop of Alexandria teaches, that whosoever does truly receive the
body of Christ, Is in Christ, and Christ in him; both so joined, one with the
other, as wax melted with wax is united together.

All these so evident Testimonies of so ancient Fathers do infer this
Conclusion against you, that none do really eat the Body of Christ, who
receive him but only Sacramentally. And See hereafter, Chap. 8. Sect. 4.
afterward other Fathers will be found to join their Consent hereunto: where
they teach that none eat his flesh, with whom Christ has not a perpetual
union. Now, for you to answer, that their meaning is not that the ungodly eat
it not really, but that they eat it unworthily, and therefore unprofitably for
their salvation; is but recoyling and giving back, when you want a shield for
your defense. For the Testimonies alleged, which deny that the faithless and
godless men Eat Christ's Body, speak directly of the Act of spiritual
Eating, and not only of the Effect, as you fancy; Peruse you their
Testimonies, and be you our Judges.

That by Spiritual Eating your Romish Corporal Union (through Sacramental
Eating) is excluded.

SECT. III.
Sacramental Eating and Union professed by your Church is (as you may
remember) said to be Corporal, by Christ's bodily Touch of the body of the
Receiver: but seeing the godly and faithful man only can be partaker of the
body and blood of Christ, and be really united unto it (as the Fathers have
declared) what could these holy Fathers have thought of your Barbarous or
rather Brutish faith, that teaches such a Corporal Union, by a bodily Touch
and Eating, whereby (according to your own Doctrine) Rats, Worms, and Dogs,
and whatsoever vile beast may be as real partakers of the body of Christ, as
Peter, or John, or whosoever the essential member of Christ? Wherefore you
must suffer us to reason as well against your Corporal Conjunction, by bodily
Touch, as Haec sententia sc* de union Corporali) multis Theologis visa est
improbabilis, -- quod non propter corporalem coniunctionem, sed propter
spiritualem, institutum est, dicente Christo, [Verba measunt vita.] Suarez Ies.
Tom. 3. Disp. 64. Sect. 3. p. 822.
Many of your Divines have done against bodily Union, by conjunction and
commixture: but why? even Because the Sacrament was not ordained for a bodily,
but for a spiritual Conjunction. So they. So that we need say no more, but
(foreseeing what you will object) we add the Propositions following.

CHAP. III.
That wicked Communicants, albeit they eat not bodily Christ's Body, yet are
they Guilty of the Lords Body, for not receiving it spiritually (namely)
through their Contempt, for not receiving the Blessing offered thereby.

SECT. I.
THe Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. 27. Whosoever (says he) Eats this Bread, and
Drinks this Cup unworthily, he shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the
Lord And (Verse. 29.) eats and drinks Damnation to himself, not discerning
the Lord's Body.

Your Rhemish Professors (men not the least zealous for your Romish Cause)
obiecting this against the Protestants, call upon you saying first, Rhemists
Annot. in. (...). Cor. 11. verse. 27.
Hereupon mark well, that ill men receive the Body and Blood of Christ, be
they Infidels, or ill livers, for else they could not be guilty of that which
they receive not. Secondly, That it could not be so heinous an offense for any
to receive a piece of bread, or a cup of wine, though they were a true
Sacrament; for it is a deadly sin for any to receive any Sacrament with will
and intention to continue in sin, or without repentance of former sins; but
yet by the unworthy receiving of no other Sacrament is man made guilty of
Christ's Body and Blood, but here, where the unworthy Receiver (as Saint
Chrysostom. Hom. 60. and 61. adpop. Antioc^.
Chrysostom says) does villainy to Christ's own person, as the Jews and
Gentiles did, that crucified him. Which invincibly proves against the
Heretics, that Christ is herein really present. And guilty is he, for not
discerning the Lord's Body, that is, because he puts no difference between
this high meat and others. So your Rhemists.

Your Cardinal also, as though he had found herein something for his purpose,
Bellar. Obijcit Cyprian. Sermon. de Lapsis, de ijs qui post negatum Christum,
sine poenitentia, accedunt; plus eosiam manibus atque orc delinquere, quam cum
Dominu^ negarunt. Deinde Cyprianum recensere miracula facta in vindictam eorum,
qui corpus Christi tantum violant. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 9. [See this
answered in the 7. Section following.]
fastneth upon the sentence of Cyprian, who accounted them, that after their
denial of Christ presented themselves to this Communion, without repentance,
to offer more injury to Christ, by their polluted hands and mouths, than
they did in denying Christ: and besides he records Examples of God's
miraculous vengeance upon those, who violated the body of Christ in this
Sacrament. So he. All these points are reducible unto three heads. One is,
that ill men might not be held guilty of the Body of Christ, except they did
receive it, as being materially present in this Sacrament. Next is the Guilt of
profaning this Sacrament, which being more heinous than the abuse of any other
Sacrament, therefore the injury is to be judged more personal. The last, that
the Examples of God's vindicative Judgments, for Contempt hereof, have been
more extraordinary: which may seem to be a Confirmation of both the former.
Before we handle these points in order, take our next Position for a Directory
to that, which shall be answered in the VI. Section.

That some Fathers understood the Apostles words 1. Cor. 10. spiritually,
(namely) as signifying the Eating of Christ's Flesh, and drinking his Blood;
both in the Old Testament and in the New.

SECT. II.
Upon those words of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 10. v. 4. [They ate of the same
spiritual meat, etc.] The Jews received the same spiritual meat, Aug.
Tract. 26. in Ioh. sup. illa verba Apostoli. 1. Cor. 10. de fidelibus Iudaeis
[Omnes eandem escam spiritualem (in Manna) edebant, and bibebant eundem potu^

spiritualem eandem: aliud illi, aliud nos bibimus, sed aliud specie visibili,
idem autem significante virtute, Item. Eandem quam nos escam; sed Patres
nostri, (nempe fideles) non Patresillorum. Aug. ibid.
says S. Augustine. Yea (says your At eandem interse, non nobiscum eandem.
Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 14.. Quia.
Cardinal) the Jews received the same among themselves, but not the same with
us Christians. So he. Albeit the words of Augustine are plainly thus; The same
which we eat: so plainly, that diverse of your own side do so directly and
truly acknowledge it, that your Jesuit Iudaeos eandem escam spiritualem
edisse nobiscum: exposuit hunc locum de Manna Augustinus, and qui eum secuti
sunt multi, ut Beda, Strabo, and Author Glossae ordinariae -- reprobatum hoc
esse a posterioribus. Ego persuasum habeo, Augustinum, si nostra aetate
fuisset, long aliter sensurum fuisse, omni genti Haereticorum inimicissimum,
cum videret Calvinistas ad eundem fere modum hunc locum interpretari.
Maldon-Jes. in Ioh. 6. v. 50. col. 706.
Maldonate, not able to gainsay this Truth, pleases himself notwithstanding
in fancying that If August. were alive in this Age, he would think otherwise,
especially perceiving Heretical Calvinists, (and Calvin. Inst. lib 4. c. 14..
23. Eandem nobiscum -- Contra Scholasticorum dogma, quo docent, veteri lege
tantum adumbrari gratiam, and nova praesentem conferri.
Calvin himself) to be of his opinion. So he. Was it not great pity that
Augustine was not brought up in the School of the Jesuits! surely they would
have taught him the Article of Transubstantiation, of the Corporal presence of
Christ in the Sacrament, and Corporal Union; against all which there could not
be a greater Adversary than was Augustine: whom Maldonate here notes to have
been the Greatest Enemy to all Heretics: whom Bertram de Corp. Dom. p. 20.
Quaeres, fortasse, quam eandem? nimirum ipsam, quam hodie populus credentium in
Ecclesia manducat. non n. licet -- diversa intelligi, quoniam unus idemque

fuisse: non n. putamus ullum fidelium dubitare, panem illum Christi corpus

Bertram followed in the same Exposition: and, by your leave, so did Eandem
escam spiritualem] Id est, Corpus Christi in signo spiritualiter intellecto:
idem, quod nos; sed aliam Escam corporalem, quam nos. Aquinas in 1. Cor. 10.
your Aquinas also; The same (says he) which we eat. Thus much by the way.
We go on to our Answers.

That the wicked Receivers are called Guilty of Christ's Body not for Eating
of his Body unworthily, but for unworthily Eating the Sacrament thereof.

SECT. III.
THe Distinction used by St. Augustine has been always as generally
acknowledged, as known, wherein he will have us to discern, in the
Eucharist, the Sacrament from the thing represented, and exhibited thereby. Of
the Sacrament he says that Aug. in Ioh. Tract. 26. Sacramentum sumitur a
quibusdam ad vitam, a quibusdam ad exitium: Res vero ipsa, cuius est
Sacramentum, omni homini ad vitam, nulli ad mortem, quicunque eius particeps
fuerit.
It is received of some to life, and of some to destruction: but the thing it
self (says he) is received of None, but to Salvation. So he. No Protestant
could speak more directly, or conclusively for proof, First, That in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist the Body of Christ is as well tendered to the wicked,
as to the Godly. Secondly, that the wicked, for want of a living Faith, have no
hand to receive it. Thirdly, that their not preparing themselves to a due
receiving of it, is a Contempt of Christ his Body and Blood. Fourthly, and
Consequently that it works the judgment of Guiltines upon them.

All which both the Evidence of Scripture, and consent of Antiquity do notably
confirm. For the Text objected does clearly confute your Romish Consequence,
because S. Paul's words are not; He that eats the Body of Christ, and
drinks his Blood unworthily, is guilty of his Body and Blood: but, He that
eats the Bread, and drinks the Cupp of the Lord unworthily, etc. which we
have proved throughout the 2. Book to signify Bread and Wine, the signs and
Sacraments of his Body and Blood, after Consecration. And (to come to
Antiquity) All the Fathers above cited Chapter 1.. 6. who denied that the wicked
Communicants are partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ (albeit knowing, as
well as you, that all such unworthy Receivers are guilty of the Body and Blood
of Christ) have thereby sufficiently confuted your Consequence, which was, that
because the wicked are Guilty of Christ's body, Ergo his Body is Corporally
present in them. But we pursue you yet further.

That a Guiltines of Contempt of Christ's Body and blood is to be acknowledged
in all profane Neglect, by whatsoever person capable of this Blessed Sacrament.

SECT. IV.
GVilty of the Lords Body:] that is, Guilty of the Contempt thereof, as you
well know. Now because Contempt of a good thing is as well seen in a wilful
refusing to receive, as in a contemptuous manner of receiving; the Guiltines by
the same Contempt must (*) See above. Chap. 2. 1.
needs be against the thing offered, whether it be Corporal or Spiritual; and
consequently against the Giver himself. In which respect Christ compares the
Refusers of the promises of the Gospel of Salvation unto beastly Hogs, which
trample under their feet pearls of highest price, even because they would not
believe them; Believing being our spiritual Receiving. From the same guilt of
Contempt follows the Obnoxiousnes to punishment, denounced by our Savior; To
shake of the d^st of their fee^^, for a testimony against them, in not
receiving the Gospel of peace. Therefore is that saying of Hierome common to
every Sacrament, Luc. 9. 5.
Contempt of a Sacrament (says he) is the contempt of him whose Sacrament it
is: As also that other of Rupertus, saying Rupertus in Ioh. 6. Si qu^^
existimat' illo Sacramento se non egere, in eo Ipso, quod manducare and bibere
contemnit, quantumvis Catholicae professionis homo sit, a societate membrorum
Christi, quae est Ecclesia, se praecidit, etc.
The not receiving of the Eucharist (if it be in contempt) does separate the
Contemner from the society of the members of Christ. Hence it was, that
whereas Quemadmodum enim frigide accedere [(...)] -- sic non co^munica^e de
istis [(...)] Chrysostom. inprimam ad Cor. 10. hom. 24.
Chrysostom called man's Indevotion in receiving the Eucharist Dangerous, he
named the Contempt of not participating thereof, Pestilence and death it self.

But not to press you further with other such like speeches of the Fathers,
we shall referr you to your Divines of Collen, who in their Council censured
those, who Contemptuously refused to communicate of this Sacrament, to be but
Conc. provinciale Coloniense fol. 29. can. 14. Qui non tutum hunc panem vitae,
qui de coelo descendit, accipere desiderant, homines solo nomine, Christiani
sunt Capernaitis deteriores, etiam voluntary in filium Dei peccantes, and
Corpori Dominico and sanguini contumeliam inferentes terribili^ quaedam
expectatio iudicijman^t.
only in name Christians, worse (say they) than the Capernaites, offering
contumely (mark we pray you, against your Rhemists) to the Body and Blood of
Christ; and are made thereby obnoxious to the terrible judgment of God. A
Conclusion, whereby is satisfied from your own Doctors your own maine
Objection, even in Terminis Terminantibus, as the School speaks, professing
both a guiltines of Christ's Body in not receiving it, and an obnoxiousnes
thereupon unto Gods Judgment.

As for your objected speech of St. Above.. 4.
Cyprian, it is of easy disgestion, because Comparisons of Magis, and Minus,
(as learning teaches) are altered upon all different respects. Some in
persecution denied Christ, in the extremity of their fear; and some in their
wilfulnes profaned the Sacrament of the Eucharist, instituted by Christ: this
latter is the greater sinner before God, who judges sin not only secundum
actum, aut effectum, according to the wicked deed done; but secundum Affectum,
that is, but much more according to the depraved Affection and Disposition of
the mind of the Doer. In which respect we may well think that Judas his
traitorous, and scornful kiss was more heinous than Peter's perjury. Have you
not read what the Apostle has written against such as Apostate from their
Faith, and vow of Baptism, saying, Heb. 6. 6.
They crucify unto themselves the son of God? which is much more than
Cyprian spoke of the Guilty Receiver of the Eucharist, yet dare not you
conclude that therefore there is a Corporal Presence of Christ in the water of
Baptism. And as in the Guilt of sin; so is it in the Guilt of punishment
also, which follows sin, as a shadow does a Body. In which consideration
A^g^stine does parallel Baptism, and the Eucharist together, saying, Aug.
lib. contra Fulgent. Donatist. Sicut qui manducat, et bibit sanguinem domini
indigne, iudicium fibi manducat, and bibit. Sic qui indigne accipit Baptisma,
^udicium fibi accipit, non salu^em.
As he that drinks the Blood of the Lord unworthily drinks his own
judgment: so does he who receives Baptism unworthily.

By these Premises you will furthermore easily discern, that your other
Romish Doctors have been no less ignorant than they were arrogant, in
concluding it to be an Infallible Consequence, that because Christ receives an
injury in his body and blood, by the abuse of the Sacrament of the Eucharist;
therefore his Body and blood is carnally present therein. As if they would
teach, by the like Inference, that because the Empress Contum elia illata
imagini, ad personam repraesentatam pertinere censetur. Nota est Historia.
Theodorij, de vindicta quam in Antiochenos exercuit, propter deiecta^

in 3. Thom. disp. 54.. 3.
E^docia was (as is confessed) reproached by the Citizens of Anti^ch, in their
despite wrought upon her image; therefore was she personally present in the
same Image.

You seem to be zealously bent against all unworthy usage of this holy
Sacrament; it is well, yet were it better that you saw your own guiltines
herein, to repentance. For inasmuch as every one is an unworthy Receiver (in
the judgment of S. Ambros. in 1. Cor. 11. Indignus est Domino, qui aliter
mysteriu^ celebrat, quam ab ^o traditum est.
Ambrose) who does celebrate it otherwise than was appointed by Christ
himself: your Ten Transgressions of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament
(discovered in the first Book) convinces you of a ten-fold Guiltines, of the
Unworthy Receiving of this Mystery. Your last objection of Guiltines is taken
from the Executions of Gods punishments. We therefore reioyne.

That the Examples of Gods vindicative Justice have appeared against the
Contemners of many holy things, without respect to the Corporal Presence of
Christ therein.

SECT. V.
COme we to the open judgments and punishments of God, upon the Contemners of
this Sacrament, the visible Testimonies of his Justice, and Arguments of the
pretiousnesse and holiness of this mystery. These we believe to be true, and
the Apostle has made it manifest, where (speaking of the great plague, which
fell upon the Corinthians, who had profaned this Sacrament of the Body and
Blood of Christ) he points this out as their sin, saying, 1. Cor. 30.
[Ob hanc causam] For this cause are many sick among you, and many sleep,
etc. Yet was not this for not Discerning the body of Christ to be corporally in
the Eucharist (as your Disputers pretend:) but (to use Saint Hierome's words)
Hier. in 1. Cor. 11. Reus erit corporis and sanguinis Christi, qui tanti
mysterij Sacramentum pro vili desp exerit.
They were guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, because they despised the
Sacrament of so great a mystery; (namely) by their profane behavior at their
receiving thereof, as if they had been at the Heathenish Bacchanals: or as
Primasius yields the Cause, Pri^as. in e^nd^^ locum. Quia acciperent quasi
cibum co^munem.
For that they took it as homely, as their common bread.

All can point at the doleful Example of God's vengeance upon Judas, the first
unworthy Receiver; and therefore the subject of the first Document of Gods
judgment, notwithstanding that he received but the Sacrament only, and not
the very body of Christ, as Saint Augustine observed, saying; See above Chap.
(...). lit. (o)
He received not the bread the Lord, but the bread of the Lord. And how
justly, may we think, did God punish certain Optatus lib. 2.
Donatists, who casting the holy Sacrament to Dogs, were themselves devoured
of Dogs? Neither have these kind of God's judgments been proper to the
Abuse of this Sacrament only, as you have instructed men to believe; for look
into the sacred story, and you shall find the men of 1. Sam. 5.
Ashdod, for meddling with the Ark of God, Afflicted with Emrods: the men of 1.
Sam. 6.
Bethshemesh smitten with a great slaughter, for but peeping into God's Arc.
Also 2. Sam. 6.
Vzzah, no Priest, does but touch the same Arc (albeit with a good intent, to
support it) and he is suddenly struck dead. Levit. 10.

thereon, and both of them were immediately burnt with fire from Heaven, and
perished. Dan. 5.
Belshazzar will needs carouze in the sacred bowls of Gods Temple, in the

peculiar existence of God in these Things. 2. King. 2.
Boys are mocking God's Prophet in Bethel, by noting him for a Bald-pate, and

If sacred stories will not prevail, peradventure your own Legends will
relish better with you: so then your Quidam, qui sancti Anthonij imaginem
abolere cupiebant, non tuleru^t illud scelus impune, sed evestigio peste illa,
quae dicitur Antonij, correpti interierunt. Bozius de signis Eccles. l. 15. c.
12. ex Lindano.
Bozius will tell you of them, Who were suddenly struck with the plague,
called Saint Anthonies plague, only for seeking to pull down and demolish
Saint Anthonies Image. Have you faith to believe this? and can you not conceive
a like right of Judgment against the Prophaners of the Sacramental Image of
Christ himself?

Be it therefore furthermore known unto you, that the Sacrament, which is
celebrated by Protestants, although it contain no Corporal Union of the body
of Christ, yet is it not so bare Bread, as your Doctors have calumniously
suggested unto you, but that God has manifested his Curses upon profane
Communicants and Contemners of this holy Mystery, which has in it a
Sacramental Union of the Body and Blood of Christ. One example, whereof we
read, is of one that being afflicted in Conscience for his Abuse of the
Sacrament, in receiving it but in one kind, Manlius locorum co^munium collect.
Minister cuiusdam Sartoris Lipsiae, Anno 1553. ob temeratam institutionem

A Batchelour of Arts, being Popishly affected, at the time of the Communion
took the Consecrated Bread, and forbearing to eat it, convayed and kept it
closely for a time; and afterward threw it over the wall of the College: but
a short time after, not enduring the torment of his guilty Conscience, he threw
himself headlong over the Battlements of the Chapel, and some few hours
after ended his life. Thus far of this Subject, concerning an Union with
Christ, as it is professed in our Church.

A Confutation of the Romish professed Corporal Conjunction of Christ his
Body with the Bodies of the Communicants.

SECT. VI.
I. That the Error of the Capernaites Ioh. 6. was an opinion of the Corporal
Eating of the flesh of Christ.

MAster Brerely, the Author of the Book of the Liturgy of the Mass (lately
published, and largely applauded by all of your profession) Master Brerely,
Liturg. Tract. 2. Sect. 3.
does bestow a whole Section in explicating the Error of the Capernaites, so
that it must wholly reflect (forsooth) upon the Protestants. It is not needful
we should deny, that in this Chapter of Saint John Christ does speak of the
Eucharist, which if we did, we might be assisted by your own Bishop Iansen.
Concord. in Ioh. 6. per totum.
Iansenius, together with diverse There are reckoned by some these Authors,
Bi^l, Cusanus, Caietane, Tapper, Hesselius: to whom may be added Peter

others, whom your Jesuit Maldonat. in Ioh. 6. verse. 53. Scio doctos, scio
Catholicos, scio religiosos, and probos viros: sed impediunt nos quo minus in
Haereticos acriter invehamur, qui hoc capite de Eucharistia non agi contendunt.
Maldonate confesses to have been Learned, Godly, and Catholic; yet
fretteth not a little at them, for so resolutely affirming that in this Chapter
of Saint John* there was no speech of the Eucharist, because by this their
opposition he was hindered (as the c Jesuit himself says) That he could not
so sharply and vehemently inueigh against Protestants. Let it then be supposed
as spoken of Sacramental eating with the mouth, as some of the Fathers
thought; but yet only Sacramentally, and not properly, as by them will be found
true.

We return to the Discourse of your Romish Priest. Above at (a.)
Christ having spoken (says he) of eating his flesh, and the Capernaites
answering [How can he give us his flesh to eat?] They undorstood eating with
the mouth, yet were (a special observation) never reproved of Christ for
mistaking the meaning of his words, a strong reason that they understood them
rightly, but for not believing them: and Christ often repeating the eating of
his flesh, and drinking of his Blood, and requiring them to believe, and when
he says [The flesh profits nothing, it is the Spirit that quickeneth] it is
not spoken to exclude the Real Presence, or to qualify his former sayings,
but to admonish them not to judge things by carnal reason, and yet more
evidently in the words following, [There are some of you that believe not.] He
said not (says Saint Augustine) there be some among you that understand not:
So plainly did he hereby instruct them not how to understand, but to believe;
for had he, for their better understanding, intended hereby to have qualified,
or corrected his former sayings, as to be meant Eating spiritually by Faith, he
would have explained himself in plain terms, and so have satisfied the
Jews. Upon which premises I do conclude, that because our Savior did reprove
his sorupulous hearers not for want of understanding, but for want of belief,
it does from thence, and other premises abundantly follow that his foresaid
promise was not obscure, and figurative, but plain and literal for our
reciving of him without out our bodily mouths.

Thus far your celebrious Priest, namely so, as in almost all other his
Collections, not understanding the Truth of the matter. His Inferences stand
thus. First, Christ reprehended the Capernaites, for not Believing his words
concerning Eating his Flesh: but not for not for understanding them. Therefore
it follows that they understood his words, of Eating his flesh, right well.
Secondly, They understood his speech: Therefore Christ, in saying The flesh
profits nothing, it is the spirit, that quickneth, did not thereby qualify
his former speech, to instruct their understanding. Thirdly, They needed no
instruction for their understanding; Therefore Christ's words of Eating his
flesh, were not figurative. Fourthly, these his words were not figurative:
Therefore his words of Eating his flesh teach a Corporal Presence thereof in
the Sacrament. Each of these Consequences are delivered as ignorantly, as
confidently. For common learning teaches, that there is a double consideration
of Truth, in every True speech: the one is (...), that it is True; the second
is (...), what is the Truth, or true sense thereof. To the apprehending of the
first is required Belief, whereupon Aristotle gave that Rule to every
Scholar, that intends to learn the principles of any Art (to wit) Oportet
discentem credere: A Scholar is bound to believe. The other point, touching
the Truth, or true sense, what it is, is the object of man's understanding; so
that there is a great difference between both These in the case of a
Reprehension. As for example; the Master teaching the definition of Logic,
saying, It is an Art of disputing rightly, may justly reprove his Scholar for
his not believing it, because his not believing is wilful: so can he not for
his not understanding it, for that he therefore learneth, because he does not
understand; except it be, that being taught he either through careless
negligence, or else affected ignorance will not understand.

This agrees with the Current of Scripture, Ioh. 6. verse. 38. Christ being the
Oracle of Truth, which descended from Heaven to reveal the will of his Father,
might justly exact belief, that whatsoever he spoke to the sons of men was
most true: as it is written, The will of God is, that whosoever believes in
me, etc. Verse. 40. vz. That they must eat his flesh. But his hearers could not
understand (...), what was the true sense of these words, which caused them to
say, This is an hard saying. Therefore (like Scholars of preposterous wits)
would they not believe (...), namely That they were True: hence it was that
Christ reproved them for not Believing only, verse. 64. and not for not
understanding. Because it was as lawful for Christ's Disciples to be ignorant
of his dark Sayings and Parables, (which were therefore so spoken, that his
Scholars might more earnestly labor to know them) as it was after lawful for
them to seek of their Master, (whose precept is to Matthew. 9. 7.
Seek, and promise to Find) how to understand them. As it is written; Matthew.
13. 36.
His Disciples said unto him, Declare unto us the Parable of the seed: and
Christ answered them, He that sows, etc.

That admirable Doctor of Gods Church Saint Augustine will show himself
herein an understanding Scholar of Christ (See his Testimony) requiring of
all the Disciples of Christ, in the first place, Belief of Christ's words,
that they are True, before they did understand what was the Truth thereof:
confirming his Rule by that Scripture; Except you believe you shall not
understand. O, but the Capernaites (says Master Brereley) did understand
Christ's words right well. And Saint August, in Ioh. 7. Tract. 27. [Sunt
quidam in vobis, qui non credunt.] Non dixit, sunt quidam in vobis, qui non
intelligunt, sed causam dixit quare non intelligunt, nempe quia non credunt --
ut Propheta, nisi credideritis, non intelligetis. Aliquanto superius. Illi non
put^runt illum erogaturum corpus suum -- Ille autem dixit, se ascensurum in
coelum -- Certe tunc intelligetis, quia co modo, quo putatis, non erogat corpus
-- [Caro non prodest quicquam] sicut illi intellexerunt carnem, spiritualiter
intellectum vivisicat. And Master Brerely out of Aug. in Psalm. 98. [Nisi quis
manducaverit,] Dixerunt, durus est hic sermo: acceperunt illud stulte,
carnaliter illud cogitaverunt.
Augustine contrary to Master Brerely, expressly answers, They did not
understand the Truth of Christ his speech, but apprehended it foolishly and
literally: nor was there ever any Father, or Author, no not in your own
Romish Church (we think) before one Master Breerley; that thought otherwise.

His second Assertion, touching that speech of Christ, [The flesh profits
nothing, it is the spirit, that quickens,] That it was not spoken by Christ
to Qualify his former terms of Eating his flesh, is very like also to be his
own, being flatly contrary to the same Father, whom he avouched; for Saint
Augustine says that Christ, by these words, taught the Capernaites to
understand his other words of Eating spiritually: a Truth which Master
Brerely's own great Master Cardinal Sed verus and literalis sensus little
verborum est, carnalis intelligentia nihil prodest, ut exponunt Theophyl.
Euthem. nec non Origines. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 14.
Bellarmine has published, alleging for proof thereof the Testimonies of
other Fathers, saying; Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euthemius, and also Origin so
expounds it. So he.

Master Breerly his third Inference is, Therefore the words, speaking of Eating
his Flesh, are not Figurative; which indeed is the maine Controversy, for
never any but an Infidel denied the speech of Christ to be true; nor yet did
ever any, but an Orthodoxe, understand the Truth of the speech, what it was,
that is to say, whether the Truth be according to a Litterall Sense (as Master
Brereley would have it) or else in a Figurative: which has been our defense
and proof throughout the Second Book, from all kind of Evidences of Truth.

Here therefore we are only to deal with Master Breerly, and with his
pretended witness Saint Augustine, to whom he would seem to adhere.
Notwithstanding (that we may believe Master Brereley himself) Master Brereley
Liturg. Book 4.. 8. at Fourthly.
If we should attend to the propriety of speech, Christ's blood is not
properly drunk. So he: albeit Christ his speech was as expressly for drinking
his Blood, as for Eating his Body. And every Schoole-boy will tell him, that
every speech, which is unproper, is figurative. As for Saint Augustine, he
stands as a sworn witness against the proper and literal sense of Eating
Christ's flesh, calling it See. afterward Chap. 6. Sect. 3. in the Challenge.
Flagitious. Besides, rather than we should want witnesses, to aver this Truth,
diverse Jesuits will be ready in the following Chapter to tell Master Brereley
flatly, that if he say the words, Eating Christ's flesh, are properly spoken,
he speaks false.

CHALLENGE,
Proving the objected Saint Augustine to contradict the Romish Doctrine of
Corporal Presence, as Protestantly as can be desired.

MAster Brereley his Conclusion, taken from Christ's speech of Eating, is to
infer a Corporal Presence of Christ in the Sacrament. But Saint Augustine
(cited above in the Margent) thus; Christ, to them that thought he was not to
give his Body to be eaten, said that he himself was to ascend up into Heaven,
and then indeed they were to know, that he meant not to give his Body to be
eaten, after that manner which they conceived, which was carnal, by tearing
and renting it in pieces.

Wherein you may plainly discern the Argument of Saint Augustine to be, that
Christ by his Bodily Ascension would show to the world, that he being bodily
absent from the Earth, his flesh could not be here eaten by Bodily Tearing
asunder. Thus he against the Capernaits, which must as necessarily confute the
Romanists Corporal Eating his flesh, whether it be by Chewing, or Swallowing;
whether visibly or invisibly it mattereth not; because it being the same Body
that ascended, were it visibly, or invisibly, it is equally absent from Earth.
We have no list, after so plain a discovery of Master Brereley his manifold
ignorances, to play upon his Person, but rather do pray that at the sight of
his Errors he may be reduced unto the Truth now, after his (fondly miscalled)
Strong Reasoning to the contrary.

CHAP. IV.
That the manner of Eating the Body of Christ, once professed in the Church of
Rome, was both Capernaitically-Hereticall, and is also still no less, in the
profession of diverse in the same Church.

SECT. I.
THe first member will appear by the faith of the Church of Rome, in the days
of Pope Nicolas, whose faith (about the year 1059.) may be best known by the
Oath, which was prescribed by him unto Berengarius, concerning the Eating of
the body of Christ in this Sacrament. Which oath (as your Baron. An. 1059. number.
11. Eodem Anno Concilium celebratum est sub Nicolao secundo Generale Romae in
Laterano, ad quod reus dicturus causam Berengarius Archidiaconus And ^gavens.

Italiae, Galliae, Germaniae, and ad quaecunque loca, quo fama Berengarij
pervenite potuit. Hactenus Baronius.
Cardinal Baronius does certify you from the stories of those times) Pope
Nicholas and a General Council held at Rome revised, approved, and prescribed
to Berengarius to take, for the abiuration of his error, concerning the manner
of eating the body of Christ: and the same Oath was after published by the
Popes authority throughout all the Cities of Italy, France, and Germany; and
wheresoever the report of Berengarius should come. So he. You cannot now but
expect such a form of an Oath, which must be as truly Romish, as either
Roman Pope, or Roman Council could devise.

Mark then the enjoined tenor of the Oath. I Berengarius Archdeacon etc. do
firmly profess, that I hold that Faith, which the Reverend P. Nicholas and
this holy Synod has commanded me to hold, (to wit) That the body of Christ is
in this Sacrament, not only as a Sacrament, but even in truth is sensibly
handled with the hands of the Priest, and broken and torn with the teeth of
the faithful. So the Oath. The same form of Abiuration is registered in the
public Papal Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. etc. Bulla P. ante Gratian. Extat in
Decret. de Consecrat. Did. 2. C. Ego Berengarius.
Decrees: and the Body of these Decrees has been lately ratified by the Bull
of P. Gregory the thirteenth. The same Faith was embraced afterward of some

and co^iunctum and proprium. Can. loc. theol. l. 5. ca. ult. sub sinem.
Canus asseverantly infers of the Body of Christ, that If it be eaten, then
certainly it is broken, and torn with the teeth. But most emphatically your
Cardinal Tam miro modo corpus Christi connectitur speciebus, ut unum ex
ambobus fiat Sacramentum. -- Ex hoc sequitur, sicut antea per cadem panis, ita
nunc corpus Christi a nobis contrectari, mandu cari, carni nostrae immisceri,
dentibusque teri; and hoc vel illo loco and vase collocari. Quae omnia sive per
se, sive per Accidens corpori Christi in Sacramento competant, nihil refert,
modo certa fide credamus haec tam vere and proprie fieri ac dici circa corpus
Christi, quam si in propria specie esset, and non minus quam sifierent in ipso
pane, non minus quam crucifixio etc. attribuuntur Domino Deo in Scriptura,

cap. 37. p. 435.
Alan. It is said (says he) to be torn with the teeth of the faithful no
less properly, than if it should be said so of the Bread, if it were eaten.
Yea and your Cardinal Hoc Concilium Generale fuit -- Et haec Abiuratio
apertissime significat rem a Concilio definitam sub Anathemate: nec
anathematizantur nisi Haereses damnatae ab Ecclesia. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch.
cap. 21.. Primum:
Bellarmine, for proof of Transubstantiation, has recourse unto the same
Roman Council, which he styles General, and notes the thing defined to have
been the judgment of the Church; and that the same Judgment was delivered
under the Censure of an Anathema and Curse against the Gainsayers: and
therefore he, with his Disciple Mr. In his Reioind. page 270.
Fisher (who also alleges the same) are challengeable to hold it according to
the literal sense thereof; because it will not admit of any qualification, by
any Trope or figure that can be devised. First, because the words are purposely
set down, as a form of Recantation and Abiuration of Heresy: but (as Nullae
sunt exactiores formulae loquendi, in materia fidei, quam eae quibus utuntur
ij, qui Haeresin abiurant. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. sanct. cap. 22.. Secundo
nulla.
you confess) There are no forms of speech more exact and proper in phrase,
concerning the matter of faith, than such as are used by them that abjure
Heresy. And Secondly, for that this form of words, of Tearing with the teeth
the flesh of Christ, was also made purposely for Abiuration, and abandoning all
figurative Sense, for the defense of the literal Exposition of the words of
Christ, [This my Body, etc.] therefore was it taken literally. But what (think
you) will Cavin say to this your (then) Romish form of Profession, in the
literal sense? Calvin. l. 2. defens. Sacram. Nonne centum potius mortes
praeoptandae sunt, quam ut quis tanti Sacrificij monstro se implicet? page 25.
A man should rather wish to die an hundred times (says he) than once to
entangle himself in a Doctrine, so monstrously sacrilegious. Which Censure of
his we now endeavor to make good.

That the former Roman Faith, of Properly Eating the Body of Christ, is
Capernaitically-Hereticall at this day; as is proved by some of your own
Doctors of the now Roman Church.

SECT. II.
YOu have heard of Berengarius his Abrenunciation of Heresy, according to the
faith of the (then) Roman Church, in Breaking the Body of Christ, and tearing
it sensibly with their teeth. Hearken now a little, and you shall hear, in a
manner, an Abrenunciation of that (then) Roman faith, by denying it to be
either properly Broken or yet really Torn, even by the Jesuits themselves.
Caro Christi, Dum in hoc Sacramento manducatur, non dentibus atteritur, quia
tangi nequit, estque immortalis and impartibilis. Manducatio autem realis
requirit contactum rei edendae, ut possit dividi and transmutari. Quod hic de
corpore Christi fieri nequit. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 20. p. 136.
Real Eating (says your Salmeron) requires a real touch and tearing of the
thing which is eaten: but the Body of Christ is not torn with the teeth, or
touched by them that eat him, because he is herein impartible. So he. Your
Jesuit and Cardinal Bellarmine is as it were in a maze, saying and
gainsaying, as you may perceive: yet notwithstanding, whether he will or no,
must perforce confess no less, when he says that Si de ratione ma^ducationis
esset attritio dentibus facta, Dico, Christi corpus vere and proprie manducari,
etiam corpore in Eucharistia, non quod attritio est necessaria ad
manducationem, satis est enim transmissio in stomachum deglutiendo. Sin vero
attritio dentibus facta sit de ratione manducationis: Dico Christi corpus
proprie manducari, non tropice: non enim dicimus corpus Christi absolute
manducari, sed manducatur sub specie panis, quaesententia significat species
manducari visibiliter and sensibiliter, ac proinde dentibus atteri. Bellar. l.
1. de Euch. c. 11.. Respon. corpus.
The Body of Christ is not absolutely eaten, but eaten under the forms of
Bread: and that is to say (says he) the forms of Bread are sensibly and
visibly eaten. So he. If this imported a literal manner of eating, then might
your Cardinal have said as literally of himself; My clothes are torn,
therefore my body is rent in pieces. Not to trouble you with the Cardinal's
Philosophy, that talks of Eating and tearing of Colors. But to the point.

If only the Accidents of Bread be (as he says) Sensibly eaten, then was Pope
Nicolas his Prescription of Eating Christ's body sensibly, in your Cardinal's
opinion, not true. And upon the same ground it is, that your Jesuit Frangi,
metaphorica, and non propria locutioest, colligitur ex Thoma qu. 77. art. 7.
and patet, quia fractio proprie and in rigore significat divisionem and
discontinuationem partium: quae constat non fieri in partibus corporis Christi.
Suarez. in Thom. qu. 75 Disp. 47. Art. 1. Sect. 4.
Suarez, out of Thomas, and other Schoolmen, affirms the word [Broken] to
be a Metaphorical phrase, not properly belonging to the body of Christ;
because it requires that there should be a Separation of the parts of that
which is properly broken. So he; as also your Canus, see in the former Section.
Canus has concluded. And your Si proprie loqui velimus, falsae sunt omnes
istae Propositiones, Corpus Christi ma^ducatur a nobis, corpus Christi
devoratur, corpus Christi fra^gitur, quia ipsi modi, qui his verbis

hae sunt verae, Recipitur a nobis sumitur a nobis. Malden Jes. Tom. 1. de
Sacram. Tract. de Euch. p. 144. Vere sumitur, sed non atteritur. Ibid. p. 143.
Jesuit Maldonate is so bold as to tell you, that these Propositions, The Body
of Christ is eaten, is Broken, Torn with the Teeth, or Devoured of us
(properly taken) are false. Thus your Jesuits, as if they had expressly said,
that to think the Body of Christ to be eaten, torn, or devoured (properly
taken) is a carnal, Capernaiticall, and (as your own Nisi sane intelligas
verba Berengarij, in maiorem haeresin incides quam ipse fuerit. Igitur omnia
referas ad species ipsas etc. Glossa apud Gratian. de Consecrat Did. 2. C. Ego

his blind zeal, Blasphemy: and answers, that you do no more Tear
Christ's flesh, than Caiphas tore his, when he rent his clothes. The Case then
is plain.

That the former Romish and Popish Faith, for the manner of of receiving of the
Body of Christ, is but somewhat altered; yet miserably inconstant and
faithless.

SECT. III.
PRotestants may have in this place just matter of insulation against your
Romish Professors, to prove their infidelity in that which they seem to
profess. As first, that the ground of your Doctrine of Corporal presence is
the literal and proper interpretation of the words of Christ, when he said
[Take, eat, this is my Body:] yet now are you compelled to say that Properly
eaten, is no proper, but a false sense.

Your Second Doctrine is, that the judgment of a Roman Pope, in a Roman
Council, in a matter of faith is Infallible. Notwithstanding Pope Nicolas,
with his Roman Council, is found to have grossly erred in a tenor of
Abiuration, which of all others (as has been confessed) is most literal, and
was therefore purposely devised against a figurative sense of the words of
Christ; and forthwith published throughout Italy, France, Germany, etc. to
direct men in the faith of sensual eating, breaking, and tearing the flesh of
Christ with their teeth: yet notwithstanding, your common Judgment being now
to reject such phrases, taken in their proper signification, and in a manner to
abrenounce Berengarius his Abrenunciation, what is, if this be not an argument
that either you say, you care not, or else believe you know not what? Let us
go on, in pursuit of your Doctrine of the Corporal manner, of eating, which
you still maintain, and it will be found to be Capernaiticall enough.

CHAP. V.
That the now Romish manner of Eating, and bodily receiving of the Body of
Christ, is sufficiently Capernaiticall in three kinds.

TEll us not that no Doctrine of your Church can be called Heretical, before
that it be so judged by some general Council: no, for Rectum est Index sui
and obliqui, and therefore an evident Truth written in the word of God does
sufficiently condemn the contrary of Heresy, as well as light does discover
and dispell Darkness. And this is manifest by the example, which we have now in
hand, of the Capernaites, old Heretics, (as all know) even because they are
set down in Scripture to have perverted the sense of Christ his words of
Eating his flesh; and thereupon to have departed from Christ, John 6.

Your Romish particular manner of Corporal Receiving of the Body of Christ in
this Sacrament is threefold. 1. Orall, in the Mouth. 2. Gutturall, in the
Throat: and (permit us this word) 3. Ventricall, in the Belly of the
Communicant.

That the Romish Orall manner of Receiving Corporally the Body of Christ, with
the mouth, is Capernaticall.

SECT. I.
CHewing the Sacrament with the Teeth was the form of Eating, at the time of
Christ his Institution, as is proved by your own Suarez. See above, Book 1.
c. 1.. 4.
Confession, in granting that the unleavened bread, which Christ used, was
[glutinosus,] that is, gluish, clammie, and such as was to be cut with a knife.
But that the same manner of Eating, by Chewing, was altered in the Apostolical
or Primitive times is not read of by any Canon; yea or yet admonition of any
Father in the Church, whether Greek, or Latin. That also Chewing continued in
the Romish Church til a thousand and fifty years after Christ, is not
obscurely employed in the former tenor of the Recantation of Berengarius,
prescribed by the same Church: which was to eat (as you have heard) By tearing
it with the teeth. And lastly that this has since continued the ordinary
custom of the same Church, is as evident by your Cardinal Alan, and Canus,
See above Chap. 4. Sect. 1. (d. c.)
who have defended the manner of eating by Tearing. Nor was Swallowing
prescribed by any until that the queazie Stomach of your Hostiam saliv a
reverenter liquefactam in corpus dimittat: non est enim dentibus terenda, vel
palato admovenda, sed ante ablutionis sumptionem deglutienda. Coster. Ios.
Institut. lib. 1. cap. 5.
Jesuits, not enduring Chewing, persuaded the contrary. Which kinds of
Eating, whether by Chewing or Swallowing of Christ's flesh, being both Orall,
none can deny to have been the opinion of the Nimis carnaliter intelligebant
(Discipuli Capernaitae) credentes eius carnem comedi oportere, sicut edebantur
animalium carnes, quae dentibus conteruntur. Madridius Ies. de frequenti usu
Eucharistiae, cap. 4.
Capernaites. First of not Chewing; and then of Swallowing in the VI. Chapter
following.

That the Corporal and Orall Eating of Christ's flesh is a Capernaiticall
Heresy; is proved by the Doctrine of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. II.
SOmetime do Ancient Fathers point out the Error of the Capernaites, set
down Ioh. 6. concerning their false interpreting the words of Christ, when he
speaks of Eating his flesh, which they understood literally. But this
literal sense Orig. Hom. 7. in Levit. page 141. Nis^ manducaveritis carnem
meam] Si secundum literam sequaris hoc ipsum quod dictum est, occidit haec
litera: vi^ tibi aliam proferam ex Evangelio literam quae occidit, [Qui non
habet, inquit, gladium, vendat tunicam, and ^mat gladium] si vero
spiritualiter, no^ occidit, sed est in eo spiritus vivificans.
Origin calls a killing letter, that is, a pernicious interpretation, even as
of that other Scripture [He that has not a sword, let him buy one, etc.] but
this latter is altogether figurative, as you know, and has a spiritual
understanding, therefore the former is figurative also.

Athanasius, Athanas. Tract. in illa verba. -- Quicunque dixerit verbum in
filium hominis, etc.] Quod hominibus corpus suffecisset ad cibum, ut* vniversis
mundi alimonia fiere^. Sed propterea ascensionis su^ m^minit, ut ^os a
corporali intellectu abstraheret -- Quae locutus sum (inquit) spiritus sunt and
vita. i. e. corpus in cibum dabitur, ut spiritualiter unicuique tribuatur, and
fiat singulis praeservatio ad resurrectionem.
confuting the Capernaiticall conceit of Corporal eating of Christ's flesh,
will have us to observe, that Christ after he spoke of his flesh, did
forthwith make mention of his Ascension into Heaven, but why? That Christ might
thereby draw their bodily thoughts from the bodily sense, namely, of eating it
corporally upon earth, which is your Romish sense. Tertullian likewise gives
the Reason of Christ's saying [It is the spirit which quickeneth] because the
Capernaites so understood the words of Christ's speech of Eating his flesh, As
if (says Tertul. de Capernaitis. Quia durum and intolerabile existimarunt
sermon^m, quasi vere carnem suam illis edendam determinasset, praemisit,
[Spiritus est qui vivificat.] lib. de Resur. carnis.
Tertullian) Christ had truly determined to give his flesh to be eaten.
Therefore it was their Error to dream of a truly corporal eating. August. in
Job. 6. Non moritur.] Non qui panem premit dente, sed qui manducat in Cord.
Tract. 26. -- Idem in Psalm. 98. Spiritualiter intelligite, non hoc Corpus, quod
videtis, manducaturi estis, and bibituri sanguinem illum, quem fusuri sunt, qui
me crucifigent: Sacrame* tum commendavi vobis, spiritualiter intellectum
vivificabit vos.
Augustine out of the ^ixt of John brings in Christ expounding his own
meaning of eating his flesh, and saying, You are not to eat this flesh which
you see, I have commended unto you a Sacrament, which being spiritually
understood shall revive you. Plainly denying it to be Christ's Body which is
eaten Orally, and then affirming it to be the Sacrament of his Body: and as
plainly calling the manner of Corporal Eating, a Pressing of bread with the
teeth. We say, Bread, not the Body of Christ. For, when he comes to our
Eating of Christ's flesh, he exempteth the corporal Instruments, and requires
only the spiritual, saying, Aug. apud Gratian. de Consecrat. Did. 2. Vt
quid.] Quid paras dentem, and ventrem? creed, and manducasti. Ex Aug. de remed.
Poenitent.. Vt quid.
Why preparest thou thy Tooth? It is then no corporal Eating: and he adds;
Believe, and thou have eaten. Saint Augustine goes on, and knowing that
corporal Eating of any thing does infer a Chewing, by dividing the thing
eaten into parts (as your own Jesuit has See above Book 4. Chap. 7.. 3.
confessed) lest we should understand this properly, he teaches us to say Idem
rursus apud Gratian ibid. Christus manducatus vivit, quia resurrexit occisus:
nec, quando manducamus, parts de illo facimus and quidem in Sacramento id fit:
norunt fideles quemadmodum manducet carnem Christi, per parts manducatur in
Sacramentis, manet integer c^o. Ex Aug. Sermon. de verbis Evangelij.
Christ is not divided into parts. Contrarily, when we speak Sacramentally,
that is, figuratively and improperly, he will have us to grant that Christ his
flesh is divided in this Sacrament, but remains whole in Heaven.

Say now; will you say that Christ's Body is Divided by your eating the
Eucharist, in a literal sense? your own Jesuits have abhorred to think so.
And dare you not say that in Eating this Sacrament you do Divide Christ's Body,
in a literal sense? then are you to abhor your Romish literal Exposition of
Christ's speech, which cannot but necessarily infer a proper Dividing of the
flesh of Christ. Lastly, do but call to remembrance Saint See above Chap. 3 1.
in the Challenge.
Augustines Observation (just the same with the now-cited Testimony of
Athanasius) to wit, Christ's mention of his, Ascension in his Body from earth,
lest that they might conceive of a Carnal Eating of his Flesh; and these
premises will fully manifest, that Saint Augustines Faith was far differing
from the now Romish, as Heaven is distant from Earth. We still stand unto
Christ's Qualification of his own speech, when he condemned all Carnal Sense
of Eating his flesh, saying thereof, The flesh profits nothing etc. For
conclusion of this point, you may take unto you the commandment of Saint
Chrysostom. in Ioh. 6. (Graece) Hom. 47. (Latin) Hom. 46. [Verba, quae ego
locutus sum, spiritus and vita.] Spiritus, hoc est Spiritualia, hoc enim nihil
carnale, nullam consequentiam carnalem habentia: [(...). -- Caro non prodest
quiequam.] Quid hoc? nunc de ipsa carne dixit? absit, sed pro carnaliter audire
deijs, qui car^aliter accipiunt quae dicuntur. -- Quomodo non prodest quicquam
caro, sine qua nemo potest vivere? vide quod non de carne, sed de carnali
auditione dictum est.
Chrysostom, as follows, Did not Christ therefore speak of his flesh? far
be it from us (says he) so to think! for how shall that flesh not profit,
without which none can have life? but in saying [The flesh profits nothing]
is meant the carnal understanding of the words of Christ. And that you may
know how absolutely he abandoneth all carnal understanding of Christ's words,
of Eating his flesh, he says, They have no fleshly, or natural Consequence
at all. So he. Ergo, say we (to the Confutation of your Romish belief) no
corporal touch of Christ in your mouths, no Corporal eating with your Teeth,
no Corporal swallowing down your Throat; how much less any Corporal
mixture in your bellies or guts?

CHALLENGE.
Whether therefore the Capernaites thought to eat Christ his flesh raw, or
roasted, torn, or whole, dead or alive; seeing that every Corporal eating
thereof, properly taken, is by the Fathers held as Carnal and Capernaiticall,
it cannot be that the Romish manner of Eating should accord, in the judgment
of Antiquity, with the doctrine of Christ. Notwithstanding you cite us to
appear before the Tribunal of Antiquity, by obiecting counter-Testimonies of
ancient Fathers; and we are as willing to give you the Answering.

The extreme Inconsionableness of Romish Disputers, in wresting the
figurative Phrases of Ancient Fathers to their Literal and Corporal manner of
Receiving the Body of Christ.

SECT. III.
IT is a miserable thing to see how your Authors delude their Readers, by
obtruding upon them the Sentences of Fathers in a literal Sense, against the
evident Expressions of the same Fathers to the contrary. I. Orig Hom. 5. in
diverse. Script. loca. Sub tectum tuum ingreditur, imitare Centurionem, and dic
non sum dignus, Domine, etc. Obijc. Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 8 No^ vidi
Adversarioru^ respo^sum ad hoc. [Yea, Resp. Orig. ibid.] Intrat nunc Dominus
sub tectum credentium duplici figura vel more, quando enim sancti Ecclesiarum
Antistites sub tectum tuum intrant, tune ibidem Dominus per cos ingreditur, and
tu sic existimes, tanquam Dominum suscipiendum. Then follows the other
figure,] Cum hic sanctus cibus, and incorruptibile ^pulum, etc.
Origin (say you) will have the Communicant to think himself Unworthy, that
the Lord should enter under the roof of his mouth. Right, he says so, but in
the same sense wherein he equivalently said, that He who entertaineth a Bishop
and Spiritual Pastor, must know that now Christ enters under his roof,
namely, Christ, figuratively. II. Chrysostom (who speaks in the highest
strain) says that Chrysostom. Hom. 60. ad pop. Antioch. Multi dicunt velle se
eius formam videre, ipse concedit, non tantum videre, sed and tangere, and
manducare, and dentibus terere. So Chrysostom. ibid. Lingua rubescit sanguine
Christi. Et lib. 3. de Sacerdotio, and Hom. 47. in Ioh. [(...)] spiritualia
sunt.
We see, touch, eat, and tear with our teeth the flesh of Christ. True, but,
to note that he spoke it in a Rhetorical and figurative Sense, he
equiualently says also in the same place; Our tongues are made red with his
blood. And elsewhere, to put all out of question; These (says he) are
spiritual, and contain no Carnal thing. Yet what need you our Comment? Your
Jesuit Maldonate would gladly prevent us: Dentibus teri, quema dmodum
Chrysostom. ^ocutus est, hae^ non possunt nisi Sacramento-tenus Intelligi non
proprie. Maldon* Ies. in Matthew. 26. 2^.
The words of Chrysostom (says he) of tearing the flesh of Christ, cannot be
otherwise understood, than Sacramentally. Even he which concluded but now, that
to say See above Chap. 4.. 2.
we Eat Christ's flesh, properly, is a false proposition.

III. Gaudentius (say you) says; Gaudent. Promisit corpus suum, porrigit tibi
corpus suu^, corpus accipis. Ob. Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 21. [Albeit a little
after upon these words, I Nisi manducaveritis:] Voluit Christus animas nostras
pre^ioso suo sanguine sanctificari, per imaginem pretiosae passionis, quo omnes
fideles populi exempla passionis ante oculos habentes, quotidie gerentes in
manibus, and ore sumentes ac pectore, redemptionis nostrae op' indelebili
memoria teneamus. Gaudent. Tract. 2. De Ratione Sacramentorum.
We receive the body, which Christ reaches. We grant he said so, but he
interprets himself, saying; Christ would have our souls sanctified by the
Image of his Passion. IV. But Aug. l. 2. con. Advers. legis and Proph. c. 9
Christum sanguinem dantem, fideli cord atque ore suscipimus. Ob. Bellar. quo
supra. cap. 24.. In sex to.
Augustine teaches that We receive the body of Christ both with heart and
mouth. Which your Obiector Notandu^. Non cord tantum, sed etiam ore dici, --
Bellar. ibid. [yet it follows immediately in Saint Augustine giving this
general Rule for such sayings,] Agi in omnibus Scripturis secundum sanae fidei
regulam, figurative dictum vel factum si quid exponitur de quibu^liber rebus
and verbis, quae in sacris paginis continentur, expositio illa ducatur, etc.
[Teaching in all other Scriptures (as in this) a figurative sense, wherein any
m^t^er of Horror or Turpitude may seem to be contained.]
notes, as being very notable for the Orall Receiving, Corporally: albeit the
same Saint Augustine immediately expresses, that this and all other such
Speeches are to be understood figuratively and unproperly. V. But Pope Leo is
brought in, saying, [ Leo Sermon. 14. de Passione Christi. Ipsum per omnia and
spirit and carne gustemus. Ob. Bellar. quo supra c. 28. [Gustemus pro
Gestamus; for he speaks of Baptism lawfully administered, whereby we are said
to Put on Christ, Gal. 3. By which (says he) Corpus regenerati fiat caro
crucifixi. [Other places objected out of Leo we grant, as Sermon. 6. de Ieiun. 7.
Men's Ore sumitur, quod cord creditur. And so say we; Ore, Sacramentally.]
Gustamus] We taste with our flesh the flesh of Christ. Nay, but you have
corrupted his Saying, for his word is [Gestamus] We bear or carry it
(namely) by being baptized (as there is expressed) whereof the Apostle said;
You have put on Christ. VI. But Pope Gregory (say you) says, Greg. Papa Hom.
22. in Evang. Qui sanguis super utrumque postem ponitur, quando non solum ore
corpotis, sed etiam ore cordis hauritur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 32.
[But Greg. a little after, Et in superliminare domus agni sa nguinem ponimus,
quia crucem ill^us passionis in front po^^amus.]
The blood of Christ is sprinkled upon both posts, when we receive it both
with heart and mouth. Which (we say) he spoke with the same Improprietie of
speech, wherein he adds equivalently that, The blood of Christ is sprinkled
upon the upper posts, when we carry in our foreheads (by Baptism) the sign
of the Cross. VII. But, Isych. lib. 6. in Levit. cap. 22. Per ignoratiam
percipit, qui nes^it quia corpus hoc and sanguis est secundum veritatem, etc.
Ob. Bellar. quo supra. [yet the same Isych. lib. 1. in Levit. cap. 2.] Carnem
aptam ^ibo fecit post passionem: si enim non fuisset crucifixus, sacrificium
eius corporis minime concederemus, comedimus autem nunc cibum s^men^es memoriam
passionis.]
Non^ receives (says Hesychius) save he that perceives the truth of his
blood. But how? even as he himself there adds, By receiving the memory of
his Passion.

VIII. But Optatus tells us that Optat. Milevit. lib. 6. cont. Parmen. In
Altaribus membra Christi sunt portata. -- Altar seeds est corporis and
sanguinis Christi. -- Immane facinus quando fregistis calices sanguinis
Christi. Obijcit* Bellarm. quo supra. Albeit the same Optatus in the same
Book; Iudaeos estis imitati, illi injecerunt manus Christo, a vobis pas^ est
in Altari.]
The members of Christ are upon the Altar: and that The Altar is the seat of
his Body and Blood: and that it is an heinous thing to break the Chalices of
the Blood of Christ, etc. We grant these to be the Phrases of Optatus, indeed,
which you have objected: but, alas! my Masters, will you never learn the
Dialect of the Ancient Fathers, after so many Examples, as it were lights, to
illuminate your judgments? Wherein (as other Fathers have done) Optatus will
instruct you, for his own language, who in this Book inveighing against the
madness of the Donatists, for their iniuring of the Ministers of Christ; Now
(says he) do you imitate the Jews, they laid hands upon Christ, and Christ
is now beaten by you on the Altar. So he; by the same Hyperbole making as well
the Priest, that ministers at the Altar, Christ; as he did the Signs and
Symboles of the parts of Christ (which are his Body and Blood) the members of
Christ: even as Christ himself said to Saul, the Persecutor of the Faithful;
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

The great Orator Chrysostom is further objected, flowing in his Rhetorike,
and saying of this Sacrament that Chrysostomus in 1. ad Cor. 10. Hom. 24. Non
conspicaris cum tantum, sed tangis, etc.
We see him on the Altar: and that He is held in the hands of the Priest:
(namely) in the same Rhetorical sense, wherewith Aug. Vos estis in mensa, vos
estis in calice. Test Beda in 1. Cor. 10.
Augustine said of all the faithful Christian Communicants; You are on the
Table; you are in the Cup. Or as Chrysostom himself required of persons
baptized in their perfect age, saying, Chrysostom. in Mare. Hom. 14. Tenete pedes
Salvatoris.
Hold you the feet of our Savior. Yet one more.

Augustine doubted not to say of this visible word, the Sacrament of Christ,
that De Consecrat did. 2. Can. Cum frangitur. Dum sanguis de calice in ora
fidelium funditur. Aug.
The Lord's blood is powered out into the mouths of the faithful. And Hierome
is as bold to say of the audible word of God, that when it is preached, Hier.
in Psalm. 147. Quando audimus s^rmonem Dei, caro Christi and sangu^s eius in
auribus fideliu^ funditur.
The blood of Christ (by it) is powered into the ears of the Hearers.

Master Master Brereley. Cyprian de Coena Dom. Christus pincerna porrexit hoc
poculum, and docuit, ut non solum exterius hoc sanguine frueremur, sed and
interius aspersione omnipotenti anima muniremur. Litur. Tract. 2.. 2. Subd. 4.
Brereley would think much not to be suffered to put in his Vie, iu the name
of Cyprian: We are anointed with his blood, not only outwardly, but also
inwardly our souls are fortified with the sprinkling thereof. So Cyprian. What
means this? not only outwardly, meaning in Body (says Master Brereley, and
adds) which convinces our Bodily receiving thereof. So he. From the same
Cyprian, who, in the same place, says in the same style, Cyprian. paulo post.
Cruc^ haeremus, sanguinem sugimus, and intra ipsa redemptoris vulnera figimus
linguam, etc.
We cleave to his Cross, suck his blood, and fix our tongues within the
wounds of our Redeemer, which are all Sacramental, Allegorical, and
Tropolasticall Phrases; as Cyprian will clearly express himself, in respect
of our outward man, and spiritually of the inward.

CHALLENGE.
BY this this time it may appear that all your so serious and exquisite
Collections out of the Fathers, for proof of a Corporal Presence of Christ in
this Sacrament, and Union with the Partakers thereof, do appear, by this
Encounter of just Parallels, to be indeed the idle Imaginations of your
Teachers, and the ^rroneous Intoxications of all their Disciples, who yield
assent unto them. For to interpret the figurative speeches of the Fathers
literally, is all one as to stick Goose-feathers in their Caps, and plainly to
befoole them, by making them of all others the most egregiously absurd (as you
have already heard,) and no less fond in the outward letter then are these
others that follow; to wit, of Gaudentius; Gaudent. Tract. 2. lubemur caput
Divinitatis eius cum pedibus incarnationis manducare.
We are commanded to eat the head of Christ's Deity, with the feet of his
Incarnation. Or the saying of Saint Hierome; Hier. in Psalm. 147. Ego corpus
Jesus Evangelium puto. -- Et cum dicit, [Qui bibit sanguinem meum] licet in
mysterio possit intelligi, tame verius sanguis eius, sermo Scripturarum est.
When Christ said, He that drinks my blood, although it may be understood in
a Mystery, yet the truer blood (says he) is the word of Scripture. Or as,
before him, Origin: Orig. in Numb. 23. Hom. 16. Bibere dicimur sanguinem
Christi, non solum Sacramentorum ritu, sed cum doctrinae eius verba recipimus,
in quibus vita consistit: sicut ipse dicit, Ioh* 6. Verba mea spiritus sunt and
vita.
We drink the blood of Christ (says he) not only by the rite of a Sacrament,
but also in receiving his word, whereof it is said, My words are spirit and
life: So they.

And so just cause have we to complain of the Inconsionableness of your
Obiecters, by their so often abusing the Testimonies of these holy Fathers;
insomuch that you had need of the often Admonition of your own Senensis: Saepe
monuimus non esse Concionatorum verba sempe^ in rigoreaccipienda: multa enim
Declamatores per Hyperbolen enuntiant and inculcant vel occasion personarum
inducti, vel affectuum impctu, vel orationis cursu rapti. Hoc interdum
Chrysostomo contigit. Sixtus Se^ens. Bibli^th. l. 6. Annot. 152.
I have often given warning (says he) that the sayings of Fathers be not urged
in the rigidnesse of their words, because they use to speak many times
HYPERBOLICALLY, and in excess, being either transported by the vehemency of
their Affections, or carried with the C^rren^ of their speech. So he.

CHAP. VI.
The Second Romish Corporal Union of the Body of Christ, with the Bodies of
the Communicants, is with Swallowing it down.

SECT. I.
YOur General Tenet is, That the Body of Christ is present in the Bodies of
the Receivers, so long as the forms of Bread and Wine continue. Next, that
Satis est ut transmissio fiat in stomachum, deglutiendo. Bell. l. 1. de Euc^.
c. 11.
It is swallowed down, and transmitted into the stomach* yet further, that
your Priest in your Roman Mass is enjoined to pray, saying, Missale Roman.
authoritate Concili^ Tridentini, and Pap^ Pij quarti. Ordinariu missae. Corpus
tuum, Domine, quod sumpsi, and sanguis, quem potavi adhaereat visceribus meis.
O Lord, let thy body which I have taken, and blood which I have drunk,
cleave unto my Guts, or Entrails. And a less Missale parvum pro Sacerdotibus
in Anglia, Iuss^ Pa^^i Quinti Papae editum. Deus, qui humani generis vtramque
substantiam praesentium munerum alimento vegetas, and renovas Sacramento,
tribue quaesumus ut little and corporibus nostris subsidium non defit, and
mentibus.
Missall (but yet of equal Authority) teaches all you English Priests to
pray, saying; O God who refreshest both our substances with this food, grant
that the supply and help hereof may not be awanting either to our bodies, or
souls. So that finally, If through infirmity of the eater it pass from the
stomach downwards, it then goes into the Draught and place of egestion. As
has been evicted from your own See above in the fourth Book C. 8.. 2.
Conclusions.

That this former Doctrine is fully and filthily Capernaiticall.

SECT. II.
IN this Romish Profession every one may see, in your Corporal Presence, two
most vile and ougly Assumptions; One is of your Devouring of Christ, and
feeding bodily of him. The other is a possibility of (saving your presence)
passing him downward into the Draught, or Seege; that being as ill, this
peradventure worse, than any Capernaiticall infatuation: for which cause it was
that your Jesuit Maldonate, although granting that you do corporally receive
it into your stomachs, yet See above C. 4. 2
denied, for shame, that you are Devourers thereof.

But, I beseech you, what then means that, which your Romish Instructions,
Decrees, and Missals (as we have Ibid.. 1.
heard) do teach you to do with the Host, in case that any either through
Infirmity, or by Surfeit and Drunkenness shall cast up the same Host out of his
stomach? We demand, may your Communicants be Vomitores, to cast it up again,
and can you deny but that they must first have been Voratores, to have
devoured that which they do so disgorge? Will you believe your Jesuit Osor,
Jes. Tom. 2. Conc. 2. in Ioh. 6. Caro mea verus est cibus etc. Vorare, est sine
masticationeglutire.
Osorius? To Devour a thing (says he) is to swallow it down without chewing.
Say now, do not you swallow the Sacrament with chewing it? then are you
Capernaiticall Tearers of Christ's Body. But do you Swallow it without
Chewing? then are you Capernaiticall Devourers thereof. Say not, that because
the Body of Christ suffers no hurt, therefore he cannot be said by
Corporal swallowing to be Devoured: for his Body was not corrupted in the
grave, and yet was it truly buried; and his Type thereof, even Jonas, without
maceration was swallowed up into the belly of the Whale, and yet had no hurt.
Notwithstanding, he was first caught and devoured, who was after cast up and
vomited.

That the same Romish manner, of Receiving it down into the Belly, is proved
to be Capernaiticall by the Judgment of Antiquity.

SECT. III.
THeophylact Theoph. in Ioh. 6. p. 304. Capernaitae putaba^t, quod Christus
cogeret eos (...), voratores carnis suae esse: nos hic spiritualiter
intelligimus, neque carnium voratores sumus.
noted the Capernaites opinion to have been, that the Receivers of the Body of
Christ are (...), Devourers of flesh, whereas the words of Christ (says he)
are to be understood spiritually, and so will it be known that we Christians
(what?) are not Devourers of Christ. So he. But, that Swallowing, properly
taken, is a Devouring, has been proved: and, if Devoured, then why not also
(that which is the Basest of all Baseness) passed down by ^gestion into the
Seege? whereof the Ancient Fathers have thus determined: Origin, that Origin in
Matthew. 25. [Quod si quicquid in os ingreditur, in ventrem abit, and in secessum
ejicitur.] E^ ille cibus sanctificatus verbo Dei, iuxta id quod habet
materiale, in ventrem abit, and in secessu^ eijcitur. Coeterum iuxta
precationem pro proportione fidei factus sit utilis, efficiens ut perspicax sit
animus. Nec materia panis, sed super eo dictus sermo prodest non indigne
comedenti. Et haec quidem de symbolico corpore: multa por^o and de verbo dici
possunt, quid factum est, caro, verus que cibus, quem qui comede^it vivet in
aeternum.
The material part of this sanctified meat passes into the Draught: which
(says he) I speak of the symbolicall Body, etc.

Here will be no place for your Bellar. Ista omnia recte intelligi possunt de
Eucharistia -- at materiale, quod in sece^sum abit, sunt accidentia, non
respectu formae naturalis, sed sanctificationis and magnitudinis: nam magnitudo
ad materiam potius pertinet quam ad formam -- Et per hoc quod Symbolicum corpus
vocat, intelligit corpus Christi, ut est hic symbolum and signum sui ipsius, ut
erat in cruce. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 8.
Cardinal's Crotchets, who confessing Origin to have spoken all this of the
Eucharist, would have us by Materials to understand Accidents in respect (says
he) of sanctification, which they had, and of Magnitude, which belongs
rather to the matter of a thing, then to the form: and, by Symbolicall Body,
to conceive, that this was meant of the Body of Christ it self, as it is
present in this Sacrament, a Sign, or Symboll of it self, as it was on the
Cross. So he: as if he meant to cross Origen's intention throughout every
part of his Testimony.

For first, That which he called Bread, he calls also meat sanctified:
Secondly, that meat he tea^meth material. Thirdly, This material, he says,
passes into the Draught. Lastly, concluding his speech, concerning the
Sacramental Body, and saying, Hitherto have I spoken of the symbolicall body;
immediately he makes his Transition to speak of the incarnate Body of Christ,
as it is the True souls meat. But first merely Accidents were never called by
the Ancient Fathers Meats. Secondly, never Materials. Thirdly, never Magnitude
in it self, without a Subject, was judged otherwise then Immateriall.
Fourthly, never any Immateriall thing to have Gravitie, or weight in pressing
the guts to make an egestion into the Sea Book 4. Chap. 10.
Draught. If every one of these be not, yet all, as a fourfold cord, may be
of force to draw any Conscionable man to grant, that Origin was of our
Protestants faith. And that which is more than all, he, in his Transition,
expressly shows his faith, concerning Christ's Body, as Spiritual Bread, by
discerning it from the Sacramental, which he named a Symbolicall Body, as one
Body distinctly differing from the other. As for your Cardinals pageant of
Christ's Body in this Sacrament, as being a Sign and Symbol of it self, as it
was on the Cross, it Book 2. C. 2.. 6.
has once already, and will the Book 6. C. 5.. 7.
second time come into play, where you will take small pleasure in this figment.

Again, concerning the Body of Christ it self, Cyrill. Hierosol. Cate.
Mystag. 5. Panis hic (...) etc.
Cyrill Christianly denies it to go either into the Belly, or into the
Draught; and Chryso^t. de Euch. in E^caen. Non sicut reliqui cibi in secessum
vadunt: absit! ne sic cogites.
Chrysostom (as judging the very thought thereof Execrable) denies it with an
Absit! Finally Ambros. lib. 5. de Sacram. cap. 4. Non iste panis est, qui vadit
in corpus, sed panis vitae aeternae, qu^ animae nostrae substantiam fulcit,
Ibid. Supersubstantialis.
Ambrose is so far from the proper swallowing of Christ in this Sacrament,
that distinguishing between Corporal Bread and the Body of Christ, (which he
calls super substantial Bread, and Bread of everlasting life, for the
establishing of man's soul) he denies flatly that this is that Bread which
goes into the Body. If any mouse, which your say may run away with the host,
be wholly fed thereon for a months space, the Egestion of that Creature will
be as absoute a Demonstration as the world can have that the matter fed upon,
after Consecration, is Bread: And why may you not as well grant a power of
Egestion, as confess (which you do) in that Creature a digestion thereof.

Two false Interpretations fell upon the Catholic Profession, concerning the
Doctrine of the Eucharist, in the days of Saint Augustine; both which that
holy Father did utterly explode. The first was by the Manichees, who teaching

that Christ was Hanged on every tree, and tied unto all meats which they
eat, would needs have their Religion to be somewhat agreeable to the Catholic
Profession. An Imputation which Saint Augustine did abhor, namely, that it
should be thought that there was the same reason of the opinion of Mystical
bread, among the Orthodoxe, which the Manich^es had of their Corporal bread.
As for example, that Christ should be Fastened or tied to men's guts, by eating,
and let loose again by their belching. Which Heretical Doctrine how shall it
not accord with your Romish, which has affirmed a passage and Entrance of
Christ's body into, and Cleaving unto men's See Chap. 7. Sect. 1.
Guts by eating? and a Repasse again by Vomitting, albeit the matter, so fast
and loose, in the judgment of St. Augustine, be Bread still, after
Consecration.

The Second Calumniation against the true Professors was by others, who
testified that Catholics in the Eucharist adored Ceres and Bacchus, after the
manner of the Paganes. What answer, do you think, would a Romish Professor
have made in this Case? doubtless (according to your doctrine of Corporal
presence) by saying thus: Whereas some affirm that we adore Bread and Wine in
this Sacrament, yet the truth is we adore that, whereinto Bread and Wine are
Transubstantiated, (to wit) the Body and blood of Christ the son of God. But
S. Augustine, as one fancying nothing less; We (says he) are far from the
Gods of the Pagans, for we embrace the Sacrament of Bread and wine. This is
all, and all this he spoke after Consecration.

Whereupon we are occasioned to admonish our Christian Reader to take heed of
the fraudulent practice of the Romish Sect, because of their abusing of the
Writings of ancient Fathers. Whereof take unto you this present Editio Paris.
Anno 1614. Noster panis -- mysticus fit nobis [Corpus Christi] non nascitur.
Whereas the direct Sense is, that Bread consecrated is not naturally bread (as
were the Spicae, that is, ^ares of corn, spoken of by the Manichees) but made
Mystical and Sacramental by Consecration.
example. The Paris Edition An. 1555. has the Sentence of S. Augustine thus:
Noster Panis -- Mysticus fit nobis, non nascitur. But the last Paris. Edition
Ann. 1614. has foisted in and inserted [Corpus Christi;] albeit the sense be
full without this Addition, to signify that Common Bread is by Consecration
made Mystical or Sacramental (according to S. Augustine his own exposition,
saying that We embrace the Sacrament of Bread, and Cup;) and also the Phrase
of [Panis fit corpus Christi] Bread is made Christ's Bodie] be repugnant to a
common Principle of all Christianity, which never believed a Body of Christ
made of Bread. So that the foresaid Addition is not a correcting, but a
Corrupting of the Text.

CHALLENGE.
HOw might it concern you upon these premises, if there be in you any spirit
of Christianity, to suffer Si praeceptiva locutio flagitium aut facinus videtur
iubere, figurata est, ut [Nisi manducaveritis carnem me^m:] facinus videtur
jubere. Ergo figura est, praecipiens passioni Domini esse communicandum, and
suaviter and utiliter recondendu^ in memoria, quia pro nobis caro eius
crucifixa and vulnerata sit. August. de Doct. Christ. lib. 3. Cap. 16.
S. Augustine to be your Moderator in this whole Cause? who upon the speech of
Christ [Except you eat my flesh] gives this general Rule, That whenever we
fi^d in Scripture any speech of commanding some ^eynous Act, or forbidding some
laudable thing, there to hold the speech to be figurative, even as this is of
eating the flesh of Christ. So he. And what this figurative speech signifies,
this holy Father declares in the next words: It Commands (says he) that
we do Communicate of the passion of Christ, and sweetly and profitably keep
in memory that his flesh was crucified for us. Thus you see he excludes the
Corporal, Sensual, and Carnal Eating, that he might establish the
spiritual of mind, and Memory. If St. Augustine by this his counsel might
have prevailed with your Disputers and Doctors, they never had fallen upon so
many Rocks, and Paradoxes, nor sunk into such puddles of so nastie and beastly
Absurdites, as have been now discovered; which by your Doctrine of Corporal
Presence you are plunged into.

CHAP. VII.
The Third Corporal manner of Union of Christ his Body, by a Bodily mixture
with the Bodies of the Communicants (professed by some Romanists at this day)
is Capernaiticall.

We hear your Jesuit reporting that Multi Catholici his temporibus, in odium

Missal, praying that The Body of Christ eaten may cleave unto your gutts?
just Manichean-wise, as you have heard even now out of St. Augustine.

CHALLENGE.
Confuting and dispelling this foggie mist of Error, by your own more common
confessions.

THis first opinion of mingling the Body of Christ corporally with man's Bodily
parts, what think you of it? your Jesuit calls it Nihilominus haec
sententia improbabilis, and aliena dignitate and maiestate huius Sacramenti,
quod non propter corporalem coniunctionem, sed propter spiritualem
institutumest, dicente Christo [Mea verba Spiritus sunt and vita. Ioh 6.]
Suarez quo sup. page 822.
Improbable, and as repugnant to the dignity and majesty of this Sacrament, See
the testimony above cited. Chap. 6.. 2.
Rash, and absurd. Justly, because if this Doctrine were true, you must
likewise grant that the same Body of Christ, which you say is eaten of myce
and Rats, is mingled within their guts, and entrails; and so such vile
Creatures should be as really capable of Communion with Christ's Body, as the
most sanctified among Christians can be: for which the Beasts themselves, if
they could speak, would (as the Ass unto Bal^am) condemn the foolishnes of
your Prophets, namely those, of whom you have See above at (b.)
heard your Jesuit confessing, that this is the Doctrine of Almost all late
Divines, which is to add one Capernaiticall Absurdity to another.

It only remains to know with what Spirits these your New Divines have thus
written; your See his Testimonies cited a little before, lit. ((...).)
Suarez tells us, saying, That they speak so in hatred of Heretics
(meaning Protestants) against whom they writ. Who would not now magnify the
Profession of Protestants, to observe their Adversaries to be so far
transported with the Spirit of malignity and giddines against them, that by the
just Judgment of God they are become so stark blind in themselves, as that
they fall into opinions not only (as is confessed) Rash and Absurd; but also
Capernaitically-Hereticall? And indeed they who imagined a Corporal Eating,
how should they not as well have conceived a Corporal fleshly Commixtion?

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Romish Objections out of the Fathers, for proof of Corporal Presence,
and Corporal union with the Bodies of the Communicants.

SECT. I.
IT cannot be denied but that many ancient Fathers are See the Testimonies in
the 3. (...) Section following.
frequent in these kind of Phrases; Our Bodies are nourished and augmented by
the flesh of Christ, and his Body is mingled with our flesh, as melted wax
with wax: yea, we have a corporal and natural union with him. These kind of
sayings of the Holy Fathers have been objected, not only by your new Witness
Suarez in the former Section, at (a, b.)
Divines, for proof of a Corporal Conjunction of Christ with the Bodies of
the Communicants, but also by your Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. per totum.
Cardinal, and all other like Romish Professors, for defense of a Corporal
Presence of the Body of Christ in this Sacrament; but with what colored
Consciences (white or black) they have been so objected, comes now to be
scanned by just Process.

That the objected Sentences of Fathers do not intend a Corporal Conjunction,
so properly called, even by the Confession of Romish Divines of best esteem.

SECT. II.
ALl your Obiectors produce the Testimonies of Fathers, for proof of a
Corporal Presence of Christ, as vehemently as the others of them have done for
maintaining of an Union properly and really Corporal. Notwithstanding the most
eminent Cathedral Doctors in your Romish Schools, to wit, Bellarmine, Tolet,
and Suarez do explode that Corporal Commixture. The first Cardinal and
Jesuit now mentioned, singling out these Fathers, who seem most peremptorily
and Emphatically to teach a Corporal nourishing, Corporal Augmentation,
Corporal and natural mixture, and Union of Christ's Body with ours; such as
were Ireneus, Hilary, Nyssen, Cyrill, and others, (as if he had forgot
himself, and meant to answer for us) says: Non est novum apud Irenaeum,
Hillarium, Nyssenum, Cyrillum, and alios, ut Eucharistia dicatur alero corpora
nostra: sed non intelligunt Patres, cum hoc dicunt, Eucharistia nutriri vel
augeri mortalem substantiam Corporis nostri, si^ enim facerent Eucharistiam
cibum ventris, non mentis, quo nihil absurdius fingi possit. Bellar. l. 2. de
Euch. c. 4. ad finem.
The Fathers in so saying are not so to be understood, as if the mortal
substance of our bodies were nourished thereby, for so they should make it
meat for the Belly, and not of the mind, than which nothing can be more
absurd. The Second Cardinal and Jesuit, speaking of Cyrill and Hilarie, Cum
dicunt Hillar. and Cyril. nostra corpora habere vnionem corporalem and
naturalem cum corpore Christi: Doctores hi non sunt ita intelligendi, utvelint
ex Christo sumpto, and sumen^e fieri unum Ens natural (indigna est illis
doctrina) sed hoc dicere voluerunt propter unionem, quae ratione charitatis and
fidei sit, adesse intra nos ipsos vere and realiter Christum ipsum, qui Causa
est fidei eiusdem. Tolet. in Ioh. 6. Annot. 29.
They say (says he) that our Bodies have a natural Conjunction and Union in
this Sacrament w^^^ the Body of Christ, but are not so to be understood, as if
there were a natural Union (which were a Doctrine unworthy of them) but their
meaning is, that for the Vnion-sake, which is of Faith and Charity, Christ is
really and truly within us, who is the cause of faith. So he.

Your Third Jesuit of prime note we Suarez in the Chap. 7.. 1.
have heard already (in Confutation of your new Divines, who collected from
such Testimonies a Proper Corporal Conjunction) terming this Doctrine Rash,
absurd, and repugnant to the dignity and Majesty of the Sacrament.

That the Objected Sentences of Fathers make not for the Romish Corporal
Union; proved by their own Dialect.

SECT. III.
THe express Testimonies of the objected Fathers you may read in the Margent,

Suarez, to wit, Irenaeus, Chrysostom, Cyril Alexand. Grego. Nyssen. Pope Leo,
and Hillarie. The Sum is, The mixture of Christ's Body with ours, by a
Corporal and natural Union in deed, and not only in faith or Affection.

Two kind of Semblances are to be observed, one in their like Hyperbolicall
Phrasing, concerning Baptism; and the other touching our Conjunction with
Christ.

Of Baptism Hilarie the 6. objected says, Christians by Baptism, which is
one, are made one, not only in affection but also in nature. Leo the 5.
objected, says also, that By Baptism the Body of the Regenerate is made the
flesh of Christ crucified. And mark what your Cardinal Tolet has collected
from Augustine, namely that Tolet. Com. in Ia^. 6. Anot. 26. Docet Augustinus
lib. 1. de Pecc. merit. Parvulos per Baptismum participes fieri huius
Sacramanti (Eucharistiae) quod hac ratione fit, nam per Baptismum sunt de

unitatis corporis ^ignum est, and ideo ho^ Sactamento aliquo modo participant,
nemp^ quantum rem significatam, and dici possunt ^arnem Christi manducare and
bibere sanguinem.
Infants by being Baptized, are made partakers of the Eucharist, because they
are memberr of the mystical Body, and are so made in a sort partakers of this
Sacrament, that is to say, of the thing signified, eating his flesh, and
drinking his Blood. So he. By which your Obiector must be enforced to admit a
like Real conjunction, and consequently of a Real presence of Christ in
Baptism, as they have for the Bodily Union and Presence of Christ in and by
the Eucharist.

Yea, and the Fathers with the like accent and Emphasis of speech say as much
of other things: Isidor. Pelus. Verbum Dei [(...).] Lib. 2. Epist. 281. Item
Gregor. Nissen. de Sancto Stephan^; Gratia Spiritus sancti permixtus est and

It is mingled with our souls, so Damascen. Of the participation of the bread
of Idolaters, with the participation of the Sacramental bread of the Lords
Supper; Primas. in 1. Cor. 10. Sicut Salvator dixit [Qui manducat meam carnem,
manet in me] -- Sic Idolorum panis Daemonum participatioest. Et ut multi de uno
pane participantes unum corpus sumus: sic si de ^odem pane manducamus, vnde
Idololatrae, unum cum illis Corpus efficimur.
That as by the one Christians are made partakers of Christ's flesh, so by that
other are men made partakers with Devils. So Primasius.

Wherefore your Disputers, by comparing these Sentences of the Fathers with the
former, if they shall take them as spoken properly, and not Sacramentally and
figuratively, shall be compelled to allow proper Commixtures and nourishings of
man's Soul, by the Word. First, a proper mingling of God's Spirit with Man.
Secondly, a proper incorporating of Man into Christ; and a proper mixture of
Man with Devils. And again upon due Comparison of the Testimonies of Fathers,
objected by you, with these now alleged by us concerning the Eucharist it
self, it will necessarily follow, that by the same reason, wherewith you have
sought to prove one kind of proper Presence of Christ's body, and
Transubstantiation, and Union; you Augustine. Consess. lib. 7. cap. 10.

must allow four more. One of Christ's body into the body of the Communicant:
a Second of a Christian Communicant into Christ's body. A Third of a Natural
bodily Union of Christians among themselves. And fourthly (which is Damascen's)
of Christ's body into men's souls. All which kind of Presences, Unions,
Mixtures, and Transubstantiations, taken in a proper sense, you cannot but
condemn as Atheologicall and senseless, in your own judgment,
notwithstanding all the former alleged Phrases of ancient In Liturg^. (...).

Fathers.

And what talk you of the Eucharist, as being called the Viaticum, and
food-provision for our iourneying through death, by the ancient Fathers? as
though this were an Argument of Christ's Corporal Presence in the Sacrament,
and Conjunction with them that participate thereof; except you meant to make
the same Consequence in behalf of Baptism, wherewith Basil. Exhort. ad
Baptismum* de Baptismo sic mo^e^ Inve^em: (...). Nazia^, Orat. ^0. de Baptismo,
vult Morientem (...) Test C^. in Baronium 16. cap. 52.
Basil exhorts both young and old to be provided, as of their Spiritual
Viaticum.

That the objected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers make against the Romish
Corporal Union of Christ's Body with the Bodies of the Communicants.

SECT. IV.
YOur Romish Corporal Union is distinguished from the Corporal Union spoken
of the Fathers, by two Properties, which are universally believed in your
Church: one is the note of the discontinuance of the Body of Christ, saying
that See above C. 7.. 1. at (c) and (d.)
The Body of Christ continues no longer in the Body of the Communicant, than
whilst the outward forms of Bread and Wine do^ remain incorrupt, The other
is the note of Community, believing that The Corporal Conjunction with the
Communicant is equally as common to the profane and godly Receiver, as are the
outward Symbols, and Signs, which they Sacramentally Eat or Drink. Such are
these your two Principles, concerning Corporal Conjunction, both which are
notably contradicted by two contrary notes of Corporal Conjunction, spoken of
by the Fathers. The first is of the Perpetuity of Christian Conjunction with
Christ, against your Non-residencie thereof. The Second is of the Peculiarity
of this Union, (namely) only unto pious, and faithful Receivers; and both
these by the Testimonies of the objected Fathers, yea even in the most of your
See above. 3. Cyril. Qui manducat, manet in me: Christus in nobis habitat. Hill.
Manet in nobis.
objected Testimonies themselves.

That the Fathers meant by their Corporal Union a perpetual residence in the
Receivers, their own See above. 3. Irenaeus, Cyril, Hill.
Testimonies above cited do declare, noting that it is the Union whereof
Christ spoke, saying, He that eats me remains in me, and dwells in me,
etc. A Truth so apparent, that your best reputed Jesuit Suarez. Si quis
dixeritunionem corporale^ durare solum quamdiu Christi praesentia durat sub
speciebus -- ex hoc contra mentem Sanctorum, Illi enim dicunt, illam Vnionem,
qua totum Ecclesiae corpus Christo, ut capiti, coniungitur -- Et eand^m (...)
^um ^a quae (...) inter ipsos Christianos, ut membra Christi. Et suam
sententiam co^firma^t ex Testimonio Pauli 1. Cor. 10. [Quoniam unus panis,
(...) corpus m^i sumus, qui de uno pane participamus:] quod probat Sanctos
loqui non de transeunte Union, sed de durabili and permanente. In Tho^. 3. qu
79. Disp 64.. 3. Ratione etiam.
Suarez is enforced to confess, that The Corporal* Union, spoken of by the
holy Fathers, is not Tra^sient and Passable, but permanent and durable: which
he proves both from their express words, and also by the ground of their
Speech, which is the Doctrine of Saint Paul, 1. Cor. 10. For we being many are
one Bread, in as much as we are partakers of one bread; which are spoken of a
permanent Union of Christians, as they are members of Christ.

As for the second note of Union, professed by holy Fathers, we have already
See above Chap. 2. Sect. 2.
learned from this their general Doctrine, that the Godly only are truly
Partakers of the flesh of Christ. And that our Union with Christ, by virtue of
this Sacrament, is proper to the Godly and Faithful, is now further confirmed
by the Testimonies See above. 3.
objected. Some expressing the Union to be such whereby Christ abides in us,
and we in him, as you have heard: and some, that whosoever has it, has
spiritual life by it; whereas They who eat the Bread of iniquity, do not
eat the flesh of Jesus, nor drink his Blood, says Hieron. Comedentes cibos
impietatis, non comedu^t carnem Jesus, nec bibunt eius sanguinem In Isa. c. 66.
Hierome; whereas your Popish Union is Suarez. Haec Vnio co^munis est
peccatoribus indigne ma^duca^tibus. Quo supra. Tota haec.
common to both. For, indeed, what is it for Christ his Body to be received of
the wicked, but, as it were, to have him buried in a grave again? And to feed
the ungodly with such precious food, is like as if a man should put meat into
the mouth of a dead Carcass.

The former Assertion being so generally the Doctrine of primitive Fathers, it
is, in it self, a full and absolute Confutation of the Romish Defense,
throughout the whole Controversy, touching the Corporal Union with the Body
of Christ, as properly so taken. Have not then your Disputers, in urging the
judgment of holy Fathers, spun a fair thread, trow ye, whereby they have thus
evidently strangled their whole Cause?

A Determination of this point in question.

I. That the former objected Sentences of Fathers, concerning Corporal Union,
are Sacramentally and Spiritually to be understood, as proper to the Godly and
Faithful Receiver.

SECT. V.
HOwsoever the sound of their words have seemed unto some of you, to teach a
proper Corporal Union with the Bodies of the Communicants, yet the Reasons
wherewith the said Sentences are invested do plainly declare, they meant
thereby a Spiritual Union only; first and principally, because they ground
their sayings upon that of Saint John, Ioh. 6.
He that eats my flesh abides in me, and has life, and I will raise him up
at the last day: He dwells in me, and I in him, which many of your own
Doctors have See above.
expounded to be taken spiritually, as does also your Bishop Ians^nius Concord.
in Ioh, 6. sparsim Dominus non loquitur de manducatione sacramental^, sed de
spirituali, quae est per ^ide^ non mortuam -- per manducare significat credere,
and non secundum primariam intentionem, sed de Sacrame^tali loquutum esse
probatur, 1. quiasupra manducare pro credere sumpsit. 2. tantum manduca^tes
intelligit cos, qui manent in Christo, and Christus in illis -- Certe ita docet
August. l. 3. de Doctrina Christ. c. 16. [Nisi manducaveritis] facinus vel
flagitium videtur iubere, figura est praecipiens Passioni Domini esse
communicandum.
Iansenius, out of Augustine. Secondly, because they make the Union perpetual
to the Receiver. Thirdly, because they hold this Union proper to the spiritual
Communicant, excluding the profane from any real participation of Christ's
flesh. Fourthly, because they taught the same Union, whereof they speak, to be
made without this Sacrament, even by See above. 3.
Baptism; and that Really, as your Jesuit Tolet has said. Fifthly, because
they have compared this Union to the continued-Vnion between Man and Wife.
Good and solid Reasons, we think, to persuade any reasonable man that they
meant no proper Corporal Union.

Whereby, peradventure, your Jesuit Tolet was See above. 3.
induced to grant, that Hilarie and Cyril, by the Corporal Union of Christ's
Body with ours, meant the Union by Faith and Charity. As also, whereas
Damascene says, That by this Communion we are made ioynt-bodies with Christ.
And lastly, Cyril of Jerusalem calls the Communicants, by reason of their
participation of the Body and Blood of Christ, Christophers, that is (being
interpreted) Carriers of Christ; and that hereby we are made partakers of that
divine nature: a Sentence much urged by your Disputers, notwithstanding your
Suarez. Damasc. lib. 4. cap. 14. Hoc sacramento -- nos Christi concorporei
existimus; -- and animo and voluntate copulamur. Cyril. Hierosol Catechis. 4.
Mystag. sumpto corpore and sanguine Christi efficimur comparticipes corporis
and sanguinis, (...) -- cum eius sanguinem and corpus intramembra nostra

efficimur. Hinc Suarez. Vbi propter Sacramentalem susceptionem non agnoscit
altam Vnionem praeter spiritualem per gratiam etc. ^n 3. T^om. qu. 79. Disp.
64. Sect. 3.. Nihilominus.
Suarez sees nothing in it but a Spiritual V^ion by Grace and Affection.
Which two Testimonies we may add to the former Fathers, for proof that only
the Godly have Union with Christ.

II. That the objected Ancient Fathers, without Contradiction to themselves,
have both affirmed and denied a Corporal and perpetual Union of Christ's
Body with the Bodies of the Communicants.

SECT. VI.
THree acceptions there may be of the word Corporal Union, the first Literal,
and proper, which this whole Book proves out of the Fathers to be
Capernaiticall, by Corporal Touching, Corporal Tearing with Teeth, Corporal
Swallowing and Devouring, and Corporal mixture with our flesh; a sense seeming
pernicious to Origin; and to Augustine odious and flagitious, as See above
Chap. 6. Sect. 3. in the Chall.
has been proved. The second is a Corporal Conjunction Sacramental: that as
they called Bread broken the Body of Christ, by reason of the Sacramental
Analogy with his Body Crucified (as has been plentifully demonstrated:) so
have they called the Sacrament all Union with our Bodies the Corporal Union of
his Body with ours; namely, that as the Bread is eaten, swallowed, disgested by
us, and incorporated into our Bodies, to the preservation of this life, so, by
the virtue of Christ's humanity dying, and rising again for us, our Bodies
shall be restored to life in that day. In which respect Bread the Sacrament of
Christ's Body, being so changed into the Substance of our flesh, is in us a
perpetual pledge of our Resurrection to glory.

The last is a Spiritual Union, that as the Body of Christ is immediately
food of the Soul only, so is the Union thereof immediately wrought in the
Soul; and because, in Christian Philosophy, the Body follows the Condition
of the Soul, according to the tenor of Judgment used in the last day, when
as the ungodly Soul shall take unto it self it is own sinful Body, and
carry it into Hell, and the regenerate Soul shall return to it is own Body,
and being united thereunto be jointly raised to immortality and bliss, and
all this by our Spiritual and Sacramental (for they are not divided in the
Godly) Communicating of the Body and Blood of Christ.

This ought not to seem unto you any novell Doctrine, having heard it
professed by your Jesuit, in your public Schools, saying; Suarez. Glori^
corpori^ ^respondet gloriae animae, sicut beartrudo animae respondet gratiae
and Charitati: ut sicut hoc Sacramentum neque haber neque habere potest aliam
efficaciam circa gloriam animae praeter came quam habet circa gratiam and
charitatem, ita neque aliter potest efficere gloriam corporis, qua^ gloriam
animae. Concludit. Hoc Sacrametum non aliam confer vitam and immortalitatem
corporis, quam nutriendo and co^servando gratia^ and charitatem. In 3. Thom.
qu. 79. Disp. 64.. 2.
The glory of the Body depends on the glory of the soul, and the Happiness
of the soul depends on Grace therein, neither does this Sacrament (says he)
any otherwise confer immortality to the Body, than by nourishing and
preserving grace in the soul. So he.

In which respect we concur with the judgment of ancient Council. Nicen. Hoc
Sacramentum Symbolu^ Resurrectionis. Ignatius; Pharmacum immortalitatis. Cyril.
Cibus nutriens ad immortalitatem. Test Suarez Ies. ibid. And Irenaeus contra
Haereslib. 4. cap. 34. Corpora nostra participantia Eucharistia^ ia^^ non sunt
corruptibilia, spem resurrection^s habentia.
Fathers, who call this Sacrament the Symbol and Token of the Resurrection, the
Medicine of Immortality, by which our very bodies have hope of Immortality. So
they. Yea and (which is a further Evidence) as your objected Optatus Bellar.
lib. 2. de Euch c. ^7. ex Optato. Optatus vocat Eucharistiam Pignus salutis,
tutelam fidei, and spem resurrectionis.
called the Eucharist, The pledge of Salvation, and hope of the Resurrection:
so does Basil. Exhort. ad Baptis. Baptismus est virtus ad resurrectionem, and
ar^^abo.
Basil speak of Baptism, tearming it our Strength unto Resurrection (being a
Sacrament both of his death and Resurrection) and the Earnest thereof. Nor can
we desire a more pregnant confutation of your Corporal Presence, than that
the Eucharist is called of the Fathers a Pledge, as you have objected. To this
purpose we are to consult with Primasius; he tells us that Christ dying
left us a Primas. in. 1. Cor. 11. Sa^vator Deus exemplum dedit, ut
quotiescunque hoc facimus in mente habeamus* quod Christus pro nobis mortuus
est, ideo nobis dicitur corpus Christi, ut cum recordati fuerimus, non simus
ingrati gratiae eius. Quemadmodum ^quis moriens relinquat ei, quem diligit,
aliquod pignus, quod ille post morte^ eius quandocunque viderit, numquid potest
lachrymas continere, si perfect dilexerit? and Co^terus the Jesuit. See above
Book 4. Chap. 9.. 5.
Pledge for our Memorandum of him after his death: By which Pledge what
Christian (as often as he shall be put in mind of his death) can then
contain himself from weeping, if he do perfectly love him? The comparison
here is taken from a man, who before his death willeave some thing of worth
with his friend, as a Pledge of his love, and a token of his Remembrance of him
after his death. But the Pledge and the Pledger are two different things in
themselves, and as different in place, the Pledge being a present token of a
Friend absent.

Nothing now remains but some one Father to be Moderator in this Point, and
no-one more fit than he, who is as vehemently objected against us, as any
other, namely, Cyprian. de coena Dom. Ad participation emspiritus, non usque ad
consubstantialitatem sed usque ad societatem germanissimam. -- Nostra and
ipsius coniunctio non miscet personas, neque unit substantias, sed affectus
consociat, and conf^^derat voluntates.
Cyprian; who speaking without all Ambages and Hyperboles says that our
Participation of this Sacrament Works not any consubstantiall Union: that the
Conjunction of Christ with us has in it no mixture of persons (vz. of Christ
and Christians:) that it uniteth not the substances, but joins affections,
and affianceth our wills. After this, he elegantly expresses the Analogy
between the Sacramental, and Spiritual nourishment: Item. Potus and esus ad
eandem pertinent rationem, quibus sicut corporea nutritur substantia, and
vivit, and incolumis perseverat: it a vita Spiritus hoc proprio alimento
nutritur: and quod est esca carni, hoc animae est sides, quod cibus corpori est
verbum spiritui, excellentiori virtute peragens aeternaliter, quam agunt
alimenta carnalia temporaliter. [Idem Cyprian. and alia multa habet contra
Carnalem Coniunctionem, de^oena Dom.
As by Eating and drinking (says he) of the bodily substance our Bodies are
fed and live: so is the life of the soul nourished with this food. So he.

III. That the former Doctrine of the Fathers is consonant to the Profession of
Protestants.

SECT. VII.
IF you take the Corporal Union of Christ's body with ours as you do, by a
Bodily Touch, bodily Eating, Swallowing, and Mixture with our bodies, We
abhor this as much as did the Ancient Fathers in these their precedent
Item's, (to wit) First, Ambrose opposing hereunto Christ's [Noli me tangere,]
Touch me not, which was spoken to Mary. Against your Touch. Secondly,
Augustines [Non dentis, sed mentis] Against your proper eating. Thirdly,
Theophylact's [We devour not his flesh.] Against your Swallowing. Fourthly
Cyprians [We mingle not persons.] Against your Transmitting him into your
Bowels and Entrails. And, for a further Discovery of Romish stupidity in your
Doctrine of Transubstantiation, the Analogy between the Sacrament and Christ,
in the Doctrine of Antiquity, is always of the substance of Bread and Wine,
with his Body and Blood. But we never read in ancient Books of your
Sacramental Eating of Accidents, Drinking of Accidents, or being fed and
living by Accidents. Wherefore muster you all those Testimonies of Fathers,
which speak of the Nourishment, augmentation, and subsistence of our Bodies by
the body and blood of Christ, and all such Sentences will be so many witnesses
of your incredible pervicacie, who seek to prove an Augmentation of our
bodies, by the body and blood of Christ, in the Eucharist: and yet profess
(according to your own Roman faith) that as soon as the Forms of Bread and
Wine eaten and drunk are corrupted (which you know is done in a very short
time) the Body and Blood of Christ has no longer Residence in the body of
the Communicant.

CHALLENGE.
THrice therefore, yea foure-times unconscionable are your Disputers, in
obiecting the former sentences of holy Fathers, as teaching a Corporal and
Natural Union of Christ's body with the bodies of Christian Communicants,
once, because they in true sense, make not at all for your Romish Tenet: next,
because they make against it: then because the Corporal Conjunction, though it
be of the Body of Christ, and Bodies of Christians, in respect of the object,
yet for the matter and subject, it is of Sacramental Bread united with our
own Bodies, in a mystical relation to the Body of our Redeemer: and lastly,
and that principally, because they meant a Spiritual Conjunction properly, and
perpetually belonging to the Sanctified Communicants, and herein consonant to
the profession of Protestants. Wherefore primitive and holy Fathers would have
stood amazed, and could not have heard, without horror, of your Corporal
Conjunction of Christ his Body in Boxes and Dunghils, in Mawes of Beasts, in
Guts of Worms, Mice and D^gges, as you have taught. Fie, Fie! Tell it not in
Gath, nor let it be once heard off in any heathenish Nation to the Blaspheming
of the Christian profession, and dishonouring of the broad Seal of the Gospel
of Christ, which is the blessed Sacrament of his precious Body and Blood.
Before we can proceed to the next Book, we are to remove a rub which lies in
our way.

CHAP. IX.
That the Objection taken from the slanders of Jews and Pagans, against
Christians, by imputing the guilt of Eating man's flesh, unto them, in
receiving of the Sacrament, is but ignorantly and idly urged by your Disputers.

SECT. I.
MAny leaves are spent by Master Breely in his Liturgy Tract. 2.. 2 subd. 4:
page 121. where, in his margent, he cites Vadian, whom he na meth a
Zwinglian: And if so, how far he was from confessing a corporal presence,
the Romish Authors, who condemn him for the contrary opinion, do prove to
be false. See above Cap. 5.. 3.
Master Brereley in pressing this Objection; the strength of his inforcement
stands thus. Iustine Martyr, in the year 130. writing an Apology to the
heathen Emperor, when he was in Discourse of the Eucharist (The reported
Doctrine whereof, concerning the real Presence, was the true and confessed
Cause of this slander) and, when he should have removed the suspicion thereof,
did notwithstanding call the Eucharist, No common Bread, but, after
Consecration, the food wherewith our Flesh and Blood are fed, etc. Then he
proceeds in urging his other Argument, borrowed from the Bellar. lib. 2. de
Euch. cap. 4.
Cardinal, to wit, Iustine his comparing the change in the Eucharist to be a
work of Omnipotency, and for his not expounding the words of Christ
figuratively. Then is brought in In the Margent of Master Brerely ibid.
Attalus the Martyr, whilst he was under the tortures, and torments of his
Persecutors, saying, Behold your doing, [Hoc est homines devorare,] This is a
devouring of men: We Christians do not devour men. To whom is joined
Tertullian, making mention of the same slander of Sacrificing a Child, and
eating his flesh, [Ad nostrae doctrinae notam:] To the infamy of our
Profession. At length Master Brerely concludes as follows; So evidently does
this slander, thus given forth by the Jews, argue sufficiently the doctrine of
Real Presence, and Sacrifice, and for as much as the slander went so generally
of all Christians, it is probable that it did not arise from any sort of one or
other Christian in particular. So he.

THE FIRST CHALLENGE, Against the Ignorance of the Obiector, and the falfe
ground of his Objection.

SECT. II.
THe confessed light of History will discover the mist of Prejudice in our
opposites; for Irenaeus, Augustine, and Epiphanius do all declare, that the
ground of this Slander against Christians, for eating man's flesh, was the
detestable fact of some Heretics, who professing themselves Christians,
notwithstanding in Celebration of the Eucharist, did indeed eat man's flesh,
as your Jesuit Maldonat. Montanistae Peputiani (ut Author est August. lib. de
Haeres. cap. 17. Et Epiph. in Haeres. 49.) Infantem conspersum farina solebant
compungere, and sanguinem ab illa expressum miscere fatina, and ex eo pane^
co^ficere ad Eucharistiam. Vnde credo natam fuisse illam notam, quam Gentiles

Euch.. Sexta Quaestio.
Maldonate, and Cardinal Baronius. Anno. 120. number. 22. vsque ad number. 36. Quae

Baronius do both witness. The former of these fixing a Credo upon it,
against your objected [Probabile] to the contrary.

Again, look but into the Testimones, as they are alleged by the Obiector,
and recorded in the Histories themselves, and it is found, that, that Slander
raised against Christians, was always for eating the flesh of a Child, or
Infant, as their Eucharist, and therefore could not reflect upon any Christian
and Sacramental communicating of Christ his flesh in the Eucharist, wherein
the Body represented (according to our Christian profession) is not of a
Child, but of a man of more than thirty years of age. I say it could no more
refl^ct on them than that other heathenish Gretzerus Jesuita de cruce lib. 1.
cap. 51. Ethinci aliqui mentiebantur Christianos Asinum pro Deo colere, Tert.
Apolog cap. 16. alij Asini caput, and per Iudibrium Christiani appellabantur

Lie, that Christians did worship an Ass or Asses head for their God. So
childishly has your Priest vaunted, in calling his Objection An evident
Argument, which will afterward Book. 6. Cha. 9.. 2.
be encountered with an Argument against your Romish Sacrifice from the Answer
of Cyril of Alexandria unto the Emperor Julian the Apostate, in defense of
Christian Religion, far more Evident than yours was from the Apology of
Iustine to the other Infidel Emperor.

A SECOND CHALLENGE, Against the Insufficiency of the Reasons collected out of
Iustine.

SECT. III.
THe Bellar. supra.
Consequences deduced out of Iustine Martyr have been answered in effect
already. First, He calls the Eucharist Not common Bread, and so does every
Christian speak of every sacred and consecrated thing: you Papists will be
offended to hear even your Holy Water (no Sacrament) to be called
Common-water. Secondly, Iustine said, As Christ was made flesh by incarnation,
so is the Eucharist by Prayer. It were an Injury to Iustine, for any man to
think him so absurd, as, dealing with an Infidel, to prove unto him one
obscure mystery of Christianity by another; And the calling of the Eucharist
Flesh Sacramentally, as being a Sign of Flesh, could be no matter of Scandal
to the Pagans, who themselves, in their Sacramentalls, usually called the Sign
by the name of the Thing signified, one instance whereof you have heard out of
Homer, calling the Lamb sacrificed, (whereby they swore for Ratification of
their Covenants) their faithful oaths. Again, the general Profession of
Christians, so well known to believe that Christ once crucified^, ac cording
to the Christian Creed, set at the right hand of God, in highest Majesty,
might quite free them from all heathenish suspicion of Corporal Eating the
flesh of Christ. Thirdly, that (...), that is, The meat blessed by giving of
Thanks, Iustine calls Christ's flesh, namely, Improperly, which who shall
affirm properly, without a Figure (by the Censure of your own Jesuits) must
be judged See above Book 2. Chap. 1.. 4.
Absurd.

THE THIRD CHALLENGE, Against the Unluckiness of the Obiectors, by their
urging that which makes against them.

SECT. IV.
FOr, first, they have told us of the Martyr Attalius, that he upbraided his
heathenish persecutors, who put him to death, calling them Devourers of men's
flesh, and avouching, in behalf of all true Christians, that they Devour not
man's flesh; which no Romish Professor at this day can affirm; this
Profession, that you swallow and transmit that flesh of Christ into the
stomach; this having been confessed by your own Jesuit to be a Devouring.
So that the Doctrine of that primitive Age (as you now see) was as different
from your Romish Noveltie, as are Corporal, and not Corporal Eating of the
same Body of Christ. Finally, All our premised Sections, throughout this Fifth
Book, do clearly make up this Conclusion, that the Body of Christ, which
Protestants do feed upon, as their souls food, is the Body of Christ once
Crucified, and now sitting in glorious majesty in Heaven: and that Body of
Christ, believed by you, is of Corporal Eating, in deed and in truth of Bread
(as has been proved, and will be further discovered in a general See
hereafter in the Eight Book.
Synopsis.) Wherefore let every Christian study with sincere conscience To
eat the flesh of Christ with a spiritual appetite, as his Souls food,
thereby to have a Spiritual Union with him proper to the Faithful; not
subject to Vomitings, or Corruption, and not common to wicked men, and vile
beasts, but always working to the salvation of the true Receiver: so shall he
abhor all your Capernatticall fancies.

Thus much of the Romish Consequence concerning Union; the next touches the
Sacrificing of the Body of Christ, whereunto we proceed, not doubting but that
we shall find your Disputers the same men, as hitherto we have done,
peremptory in their Assertions, Unconscionable in wresting of the Fathers, and
vain, fantastical, and absurd in their Inferences and Conclusions.

THE SIXTH BOOK,
Entreating of the fourth Romish Consequence, which concerns the pretended
proper Propitiatory Sacrifice in the Romish Mass, arising from the depraved
Sense of the former words of Christ; [THIS IS MY BODY:] and confuted by the
true Sense of the words following, [IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME.]

The State of the Controversy.

WHosoever shall deny it (say your Fathers of Si quis dixerit, non offerri Deo
verum and proprium Sacrificium, aut non esse Propitiatorium, Anathema fit.
Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. Con. 1. and 3. Visibile. cap. 1. Sacramentum vere
propitiatorium. cap. 2.
Trent) to be a true and proper Sacrifice: or that it is Propitiatory, Let him
be Anathema, or Accursed. Which one Canon has begot two Controversies (as you
Prima Controversia est, sit ne Missa vere and proprie dictum Sacrificium.
Secunda, sit ne Propitiatorium. Bellar. Praef. ante Tract. de Missa.
know) One, Whether the Sacrifice in the Mass be a proper Sacrifice. 2.
Whether it be truly Propitiatory. Your Trent-Synode has affirmed both;
Protestants deny both; so that, Proper, and Improper, are the distinct Borders
of both Controversies. And now whether the Affirmers or Denyers, that is, the
Cursers, or the parties so Cursed deserve rather the Curse of God, we are
forthwith to examine. We begin with the Sacrifice, as it is called Proper.

This Examination has four Trials: 1. By the Scripture. 2. By the Judgment
of Ancient Fathers. 3. By Romish Principles; and 4. By Comparison between this
your Mass, and the Protestants Sacrifice, in the Celebration of the holy
Eucharist.

CHAP. I.
Our Examination by Scripture.

SCriptures alleged by your Disputers, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice, are
partly out of the new Testament, and partly out of the old. In the new, some
Objections are collected out of the Gospel of Christ, and some out of other
places. We beginning at the Gospel, assuredly affirm that if there were in
it any note of a Proper Sacrifice, it must necessarily appear either from some
special word, or else from some Sacrificing Act of Christ, at the first
Institution.

First of Christ's words.

That there is no one word, in Christ his first Institution, which can probably
infer a Proper Sacrifice; not the first and principal words of Luc. 22. [HOC
FACITF: DO THIS.]

SECT. I.
WHen we call upon you for a Proof, by the words of Christ, we exact not the
very word Offering, or Sacrifice, in the same Syllables, but shall be content
with any Phrase of equivalencie, amounting to the sense or meaning of a
Sacrifice. In the first place you object those words of Christ, [Hoc facite,
Do this,] from which your Council of [Hoc facite] Tunc, ut a Sancta Synodo
definitum est, Christus Sacerdotes instituit, praecepitque ut and ipsi and qui
successuri cis essent, corpus ejus immolarent. Catechis. Trid. de Euch. number. 58.
Trent has collected the Sacrificing of the Body of Christ: which your
Cardinal avoucheth with his Certum est, probari Sacrificium Missae his verbis
[Hoc facite] etc. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12.
Certum est, as a Truth without all exception; as if [Doe this,] in the
literal sense, were all one with [Doe you Sacrifice.] But why? because,
forsooth, the same word in the Hebrew Original, and in the Greek Translation
is so used, Levit. 15. for Do, or Make, spoken of the Turtle-dove prepared for
an Holocaust, or Sacrifice: and 1 Kings 18. 23. where Elias (speaking of the
Priests of Baal, and telling them that he meant to have a Sacrifice,) said,
Do, or Make. So he, together with some other Jesuits. But vainly,
ridiculously, and injuriously.

I. Vainly, because the word, Do, in those Scriptures did not simply in it
self import a Sacrifice, but only consequently (to wit) by reason of the
matter subject then spoken of, which was a matter of Sacrifice: and are so
explaned by just circumstances, as may appear in the places objected, Levit.
15. where was speech of a Turtle-dove appointed for a Sacrifice. And so
likewise in 1. Kings 18. 23. was there mention of a Bullock to be ordained for
a Sacrifice. Whosoever, having spoken of his Riding, shall command one servant,
saying, Make ready: and after, being an hungry, and having spoken of meat,
shall command another, saying likewise, Make ready, None can be so simple as
to confound the different senses of the same word Make, but knows right well
that the Significations are to be distinguished by the different subjects of
Speech; the first relating to his horse, and the other to his meat, and the
like, wherein the different Circumstances do diversifie the sense of the same
word.

II. Ridiculously. For if the Hebrew and Greek Gnaschah, Heb: the same in
Greek, (...), in Latin, Facio. Iud. 6. 29. Ios. 5. verse. ult. Ioh. 13. 7.
(...), and Marc. 11. 3. Si quis dixerit, (...);
Editions, which signify Do this, do necessarily argue a sacrificing act or
Sacrifice, then shall you be compelled to admit of strange and od kinds of
Sacrifices; one in Gedeon his destroying of the Altar of Baal: another in Moses
his Putting off of his shoes. A third in Christ's washing of his Disciples
feet. A fourth (to go no further) in the Man's Loosing of his Colt. In all
which Instances there are the same original words now objected, by
interpretation, Do, or Make.

III. Injuriously. First, to the Text of Christ, wherein the word is not
indefinite, Do, but determinate, [Doe this.] Next, Injurious to your own many
Authors: for the words, [Doe this] (by the Sea above Book 5. Chap. 2.. 2.
confessions of your own Jesuits and others) have reference to all the former
Acts of Christ his Celebration, then specified; as namely, Blessing, Breaking,
Eating, etc. Yea and, if your Cardinals Answer were held so Certain among
your selves, then would not your Jesuit Maldonate have so far slighted it,
as to say, Maldon. Non quod contendam illud verbum [Facite] illo loco
significare idem quod sacrificare. Lib. 7. de Sacram. Tom. 1. part. 3. de
Eucharist.
I will not contend, that in this place the word [Doe] signifies the same
with, Do sacrifice. Next, Injurious to antiquity, which (as is confessed)
Quod olim dicimus, Missas facere, Veteres quoque dixerunt Divine mysteria
celebrare. Hilar. etc. Ex Cassand. Liturg. cap. 16.
called Doing Mass the Celebration of the Sacrament. Besides, Injurious to
your own Mass, in the Canon inserted by Alexander Papa and Martyr, Passionem
Domini inserens Canoni Missae, ait, [Hoc quotie scunque feceritis,] Id est,
Benedixeritis, Fregeritis, Distribueritis, etc. Id. Cassander ibid. cap. ^9.
Alexander Pope and Martyr, of the Primitive age, in these words; [Doe this as
often] that is, Bless it, Break it, Distribute it, etc. A plain and direct
Interpretation of the words [Doe this.] Lastly, Injurious to S. Paul, who, in
his Comment upon the words of Christ his Institution, does put the matter out
of question, 1. Cor. 11. where, after the words [Doe this, as often as you do
it, in remembrance of me,] verse. 25. immediately expounding what was meant by
Doing, expresses the Acts of Doing, thus: As often as you shall eat this
Bread, and drink this Cup, etc. Which his Command of Doing, by Eating and
Drinking, was spoken generally to all the faithful in Corinth; that you may
not imagine it was wholly restrained to the sacrificing Priests.

Other Romish Doctors also, if they had been so sure of the force of the word
[FACITE,] as your Cardinal seems to be, then surely would they not have
sought to prove it from Virgils Calfe, where it is said; Cum faciam Vitula --
and were therefore noted by Calvin and Chemnitius of bold Ignorance. But these
two Protestants, for so saying, have been since branded by your Operae-pretium
erit imposturam Adversariorum refutare. Calvinus fingit Catholicos ^ira probare
Propositionem nostri argumenti ex Virgilii verbis, Cum faciam vitula, etc.
(...) Kemnitius ridet Catholicos. -- sed errant, nec bon^ fide referunt
argumenta Catholicorum. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, c. 12.
Cardinal with a mark of Imposture, as if they had falsely taxed your Romish
Authors of such fondness. But now what shall we say to such a Gnostick, who,
as though he had known what all the Doctors in the Church of Rome had then
written and ^ented, durst thus engage his word for every one? It may be, he
presumed, that none of them could be so absurd. But your Iansenius will quit
the report of Calvine and Chemnitius from the suspicion of Falsehood, who
witnesses, concerning some Romish Authors of his time, saying; Sunt qui ex
verbo [Facite] Sacrificium ostendere co^antur, quia al^quando accipitur pro
Sacrificare, ut cum Virgilius dicit -- Cum faciam vitula pro frugibus ipse
veni^o. Ianse^. ^oncord* in eum locum. cap. ^31. p. 904.
There are some who endeavor to prove the word [Facere] to be put for
[Sacrificare] by that saying of Virgil, -- Cum faciam vitula. So he. And why
might not they have been as absurd, as some others that came after, yea (by
your leave) Et Poeta, Cum faciam vitula, etc. Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de Sacrif.
Missae, c. 4.. Fatentur. p. 519. Eam vim habet verbu^ Faciendi, ut cum Poeta
dicit, Cum faciam Vitula, etc. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 27. page 205..
Septimo.
Jesuits themselves, of your Bellarmines own Society, who in like manner
have consulted with the Poet Virgil about his Calfe; but as wisely (according
to our Proverb) as Walton's Calfe, which went etc. For the matter subject of
the Poets Sacrifice is there expressed to have been Vitula, a Calfe. You have
failed in your first Objection.

That a Proper Sacrifice cannot be collected out of any of these words of
Christ's Institution; Is GIVEN, Is BROKEN, Is SHED.

SECT. II.
THe Text is Luc. 22. 20. [Which Is broken, Is given, Is shed] in the Present
Tense; and This Is the Cup of the new Testament in my Blood; wherein, according
to the Greek, there is a varying of the Case: whereupon your Disputers, as if
they had cried (...), are commonly more Instant in this Objection than in any
other: some of them spending eight full leaves in pressing this Text, by two
Arguments, one in respect of the Case, and another in regard of the Time.

Of the Grammar point, concerning the Case.

This is the new Testament in my Blood:] Now what of this? Bellarm. de Missa,
lib. 1. cap. 1, 2. In Graeco Textu (...), dicit, Calix qui funditur, non hic
est sanguis qui funditur: itaque indicant sangu^em fundi, ut erat in Calice.
It is not said (says your Cardinal) This is the Blood shed for you, but,
This is the Cup shed for you: Therefore is hereby meant The Blood, which was in
the Chalice, because wine could not be said to be shed for us for remission of
sins. But how gather you this? Because in the (...).
Greek (says M. M. Breely Liturg. tra^^. 3. c. 3. subd. 2.
Breerly) (...) varieth the Case from the word [Sanguine,] and the Genus from
the word [Testamentum,] and agrees evidently with Calix: which drive Beza unto
a strange Answer, saying that this is a Soloe cophanes, or Incongruitie of
speech. So he; which Objection he learned, peradventure, of the Rhemists A^.
upon Luc. 22. 20.
Rhemists, who are vehement in pressing the same; their Conclusion is: This
proves the Sacrifice of Christ's Blood in the Chalice. In which one Collection
they labor upon many ignorances. 1. As if a Soloe cophanes were a profanation
of Scripture by Incongruitie of speech; which (as one Rodolph. Goclenius
Professor Marpurg. Problem. Gram. lib. 5. Demosthenes. (...) -- pro (...). Cic.
2. de Orat. Benedicere autem, quod est perite loqui, non habet definita^
aliqua^ regione^, cujus terminis septa teneatur. Vox [Septa] non congruit cum
(...) Benedicere, sed referenda est ad vocem Eloquentiae. He observes the
like in Plato, Virgil, Homer, page 232, 233, 261, 262.
Protestant has proved) is used as an Elegancie of speech by the two Princes
of Orators, Demosthenes for the Greek, and Tully for the Latin; and by the
two Parents of Poets, among the Greeks Homer, and by Virgil among the Latins.

2. As though these our Adversaries were fit men to upbraid Beza with one
Soloecophanes, which is but a Seeming Incongruitie, like a Seeming Limping, who
themselves confess Sixtus Sen^^sis Biblioth. lib. 8. page ult. Nos ingenue fa^
nonnullas mendas in hac nostra editione inveniri, etiam Soloecismos, and
Barbarismos, hyperbata, etc.
Ingeniously that in their Vulgar Latin Translation (which is decreed by the
Council of Trent to be Authentical) there are mere Solecismes, and
Barbarismes, and other faults, which we may call, in point of Grammar, down
right halting. 3. As if a Truth might not be delivered in a Barbarous speech,
or that this could be denied by them, who defend Solecismes, and Barbarismes,
which had crept into the Translation of Scriptures, saying that Rhemists
Preface before the New Testament.
Ancient Fathers, and Doctors have had such a religious care of former
Translations, that they would not change their Babarismes of the Vulgar Latin
Text, [as nubent, and nubentur] and the like. 4. As if there were not the like
Soloecophanes of Relatives not agreeing with their Antecedents in case, whereof
you have received from D. Fulke against Greg. Martin.
D. Fulke diverse Apoc. 1. 4. and 8. 9. and 3. 12. etc.
Examples. 5. As if this Soloecophanes now objected were not justifiable, which
is defended by the Myrrour of Grammarians Joseph. Scaligeri Notae in novum
Testamentum. Luc. 22. 20. (...): Mera est Antiptosis, pro, (...).
Joseph Scaliger by a figure Antiptosis, and explaned anciently by (...).
Basil. Reg. Moral. 21.
Basil a perfect Greek Father: referring the Participle [Shed] unto the word
Blood, and not unto the Chalice; which marreth your Market quite. And that this
is an undeniable Truth, will appear in our Answer to the next Objection of
Time; for if by Given, Broken, and Shed is meant the time future, then these
words Shed for you, for remission of sins, flatly conclude that hereby is not
meant any proper Sacrifice of Christ's Blood in the Cup, but on the Cross. Let
us proceed therefore to that point.

Of the Time signified by the Participles Given, Broken, Shed.

These words being of the Present time, Therefore it plainly follows that
Breaking, Giving Christ's Body, and shedding his Blood is in the Supper, and
not on the Cross: So your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Miss. cap. 12. Datur, Frangitur,
Funditur, in Praesenti tempore, docet apertissime no^ fusum esse in Cruc^
sanguinem, sed in Coena.
Cardinal: most invincibly say your Rhemists upon Luc. 22. 20.
Rhemists, and M. Breerly, as dancing merrily after their Pipes; M. Breerly,
Liturg. Tract. 3.. 3. subd. 1. p. 319.
This point (says he) is clearly determined by the Evangelists themselves in
their own origin all writings, Broken, Given, Shed. And Ibid. subd. 3. p. 319.
The Evasions, which our Adversaries seek, whereby to avoid this, are
enforced, racked, and miserable shifts. And again, for corroboration sake.
Ibid. subd. 1. p. 317.
The word Broken also, spoken in regard of the outward forms, which are in
time of Sacrificing, is more forcible, because not meant of the Cross: for
when they saw he was dead, fulfilling the Prophecy [A Bone of him shall not
be Broken] they brake not his legs. Ioh. 19. 33. So he, and so they. Alas!
what huge Anakims, and Giants have we to deal withal, no Argument can
proceed from them but most Evident, Forcible, and Invincible; yet may we not
despair of due Resistance, especially being supported by your own Brethren,
as well the Sons of Anak, as were the other: besides some better aid both
from Fathers, and Scriptures, for proof that these words Broken, Given, Shed,
spoken in the Present time, do signify the Future time of Christ's Body being
Broken, and Bloodshed; and both Given up as a Sacrifice instantly after upon
the Cross.

What Authors on your side may satisfy you? whether your Two See above. chap.
2. (...). 4.
choice Jesuits, Salmeron and Valentia? or will you be directed by most
voices, whereby it is confessed (namely) that Iansenius referring it to the
Cup, yet says: [Qui effunditur] communiter intelligitur de effusione facta in
Cruce, and recte. Concord. 131.
By Blood shed, is commonly understood of it shed upon the Cross. But what
need have we of the several members, when as the whole Body of your Romish
Church is for us, rendering the word shed, in the Future Tense [Fundetur,] shall
be shed, as referred to the Cross? What think you by this? say M. Breerly.
Liturg. Tract. 3.. 3. subd. 1.
Our Adversaries are in great straights, when they are glad to appeal from the
Original Greek Text which they call Authentical, unto the Latin Vulgar
Translation, which they call old, rotten, and full of corruptions. This were
well objected, indeed, if that Protestants should allege your Vulgar Latin
Edition, as a purer Translation, and not as a true Translation of the words of
the Text* to teach you that it is meant of the Future Time: and that this were
urged by them, as a ground of Persuasion to themselves, and not rather (as it
were by the Law of Arms) an Opposition, and indeed Conviction upon their
Adversaries, who, by the Decree of your Council of Trent, are bound See
hereafter Book (...).
Not to reject it upon any pretense whatsoever. And to have this your own
Authentical Translation to make against you, is to be in straights indeed,
because all the Decrees of that Council, by the Bull of Pope Pius 4. are put
upon you to be believed under the bond of an Oath.

Is it possible for you to shake off these shackles? Yes, M. Breerly can, by an
admirable Trick of wit: Liturg. in the place above cited.
Nevertheless (says he) I answer in behalf of the Vulgar Interpreter, that
as he translateth in the Future Tense, [which shall be shed] so does he use
the Present Tense in the other words Given, and Broken, to signify that it was
then given in the Sacrament, and afterward to be given upon the Cross, both
together. As if you should tell us in plain English that your Church in her
Vulgar Latin Text does equivocate, teaching that It shall be shed, in the
Future, does signify also the Present Tense Is shed, that is, It is, shall be.
A fit man (forsooth) to inveigh against a Soloecophanes. But how then can
Protestants interpret the Present to signify the Future? We tell you, because
you have in Scriptures, and other Authors thousands of Examples of the Present
Tense put for the Future, to signify the certainty or instancie of that which
is spoken: but was it never heard nor read, that the Future Tense was taken for
the Present Tense, because there is no Course, nor Progress to the time past.
And if Shed be taken not in true sense, then shall it be lawful for every
petty Romish Priest at every Masse-saving to correct your Romish Missall,
authorized by the same Tridentine Fathers, which has it Missale Romans Calix
Sanguinis -- qui effundetur.
Shall be shed.

One word more with M. Breerly, only desirous to know of him, if he allow of
the Tense either Present or Future, whether it was straightness, or
looseness, that occasioned him to deliver it in the Preterimperfect Tense
Liturg. Tract. 3. c. 3. subd. 3. p. 145.
Was shed. But he will expect that we answer his Reason.

He urged the word, Broken, that because this could not be meant of Broken on
the Cross, for that His Legs were not there Broken (according as it was
prophesied) therefore it must infer it to have been Broken at his Supper,
when he uttered the word Broken; which is like his other manner of Reasons,
blunt, and broken at the point, as it became one not much conversant in
Scripture: else might he have answered himself by another Prophecy, teaching
that the word Broken is taken Metaphorically by the Prophet Esaias, chap. 53.
speaking of the crucifying and Agonies of Christ, and saying, He was Broken
for our iniquities: (namely, as two of your Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 3. c.
3. p. 90. Frangitur, i. e. Clavis, Lancea, Flagellis laniandum est. Barradas
Tom. 4. in Concord. c. 4. e Chrysostom. in 1 Cor. hom. 24. quod fiangitur, hoc
est, quod Clavis frangitur.
Jesuits acknowledge) By nails, spear, and whips; and is to be applied to
the Breaking of his sinews, nerves, and veins, as your Bellarm. Vtcunque
possit fractio, etc. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12.. Ad quartum.
Cardinal confesses.

That the words of Christ, [Given, Broken, Shed,] are taken for the Future
Time; proved by the same Text of Scripture, and consent of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. III.
AS for our selves, we, before all other Reasons, and against all opposition
whatsoever, take our light from the same Scripture (immediately after the Text
objected) wherein it is said of Judas, Luc. 22. 21.
He that betrayeth me; and again, Christ of himself, Verse. 22.
I go my way, both in the Present Tense, but both betokening the Future:
because neither Judas at that instant practiced any thing, nor did Christ move
any whit out of his place. Lastly, if ancient Fathers may be held for
indifferent and competent Origin. Hom. 9. in Levit. [Effundetur] Test Bellarm.
lib. 2. de Euch. c. 8. Tertull. l. 3. in Marc. [Tradetur] Test Bellarm. ibid.

Expositors, we have Origin, Tertullian, Athanasius, Basil, Ambrose, Theodoret,
Isidore, Pope Alexander, and Chrysostom, All for the Future Tense, by their
Confringetur, Tradetur, Effundetur. What, my Masters, is there no learning but
under your Romish caps?

That the objected words of Christ, and the whole Text, do utterly overthrow
the pretended Sacrifice in the Romish Mass.

SECT. IV.
AMong the words of Institution, the first which offers it self to our use,
is the formerly-objected word, BROKEN; which word (said your Jesuit See above
Book^ 2. Chap. 2.
Suares) is taken unproperly, because in the proper and exact acception it
should signify a dividing of the body of Christ into parts. So he, and that
truly. Else why (we pray you) is it, that your Roman Church has left out of
her Mass the same word [Broken] used by Christ in the words, which you term
words of Consecration?

Although you (peradventure) would be silent, yet your Bishop Ex qua intellige,
^a verba [Quod provobis frangitur] non esse ad Consecrationem necessaria: sed
consulto a Latinis praetermissa, ne esset locus absurdae intelligentiae, qua
quis existimare possit vere frangi corpus Christi. Iansen. Concord. cap. 131.
in Matthew. 26.
Iansenius will not forbear to tell us, that It was left out, lest that any
man might conceive so fondly, as to think the body of Christ to be truly
broken. So he. It is well.

The word, [Shed] is the next, which properly signifies the issuing of blood
out of the veins of Christ; But, That Blood of Christ (says your Bellarm.
lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12.. Ad secundum. Sanguis Christi reipsa non e^ de
Corpore.
Cardinal, speaking of the first Institution) did not pass out of his Body.
Even as See above Book 4. Chap. 2. Sect. 3.
Aquinas had said before him. But most emphatically your Alphonsus. Alfo^sus
lib. 6. adversus Haeres. Tit. Eucharistia, ^^res. ult. Cum Sanguinem p^o nobis
semel in ara Crucis e^^usum, post resurrectionem nunquam eum fu^urus sit:
convincitur inde etiam, nunquam sanguinem verum il^s integre alicubi e^^e ^ine
ejus corpore vero. -- Sol. Ob. Quamvis sub specie vini totus Christus lateat,
non tamen species illae totum Christum significant, sed solum sanguinem e^^usum
in Cruce, and a corpore separatum.
Christ his Blood was once shed upon the Cross, never to be shed again after
his resurrection, which cannot be perfectly separated from his Body. And
accordingly your Jesuit Coster. Euchirid. cap. 9. de Sacrificio.. Ex quibus.
Christus veram sanguinis effusionem passus in cruce, sanguine ipso a corpore
separato. Hic vero tantum illius mortis repraesentatio.
Coster; The true effusion of his Blood, which is by separating it from the
Body, was only on the Cross. So they.

Hearken now. These words, Blood shed, and Body broken, were spoken then by
Christ, and are now recited by your Priest either in the proper sense of
shedding, or they are not. If in a proper sense, then is it properly separated
from his Body, (against your former Confession, and Profession of all
Christians;) But if it be said to be shed unproperly, then are your Objectors
of a proper Sense of Christ his words to be properly called deceitful
Sophisters, as men who speak not from conscience, but for contention: who
being defeated in their first skirmish, about Christ's words, do fly for
refuge to his Acts, and Deeds; whither we further pursue them.

That there was no Sacrificing Act in the whole Institution of Christ, which
the Romish Church can justly pretend for defense of her Proper Sacrifice;
proved by your own Confessions.

SECT. V.
THere are six Acts of Christ, which your Proctors, who plead for a proper
Sacrifice, do pretend for proof thereof, as being ascribable to the
Institution of Christ, and are as readily and roundly confuted by their own
fellows, as they were by others frequently and diligently fought out, or
vehemently objected: which the Marginals will manifest unto you, in every
particular* to be no essential Acts of a proper Sacrifice. 1. Not Sotus cum

Some think) Is it not of the Essence of a Sacrifice. And why should not they
so judge? (say we,) for many things are Sacrata, that is, Consecrated, which
are not Sacrificata, that is, Sacrificed. Else what will you say of Water in
Baptism, yea of your Holy-water-sprinckle? of your Pots, Bells, Vestments?
which, being held by you as Sacred, are notwithstanding not so much as
Sacramentals. Besides, if Consecration made the Sacrifice, then Bread being
only consecrated, it alone should be the Sacrifice in your Mass. 4. Post

Suarez, accompanied with with seven other of your Schoolmen do gainsay;
because this is Rather proper to a Sacrament, than to a Sacrifice. And for that
also (if it were essential) the People might be held Sacrificers, as well as
Priests. So they, of these Particulars; whereof some are more largely discussed
afterward. (i) Suarez. Sumptionem Sacerdo^alem non esse de Essenti^, t^

CHALLENGE.
COnsider now (we pray you) that (as you All Tota Essentia Sacrificii pendet
ex Institutione Christi. Sua^^z, and Salme^on supra.
confess) The whole Essence of a Sacrifice depends upon the Institution of
Christ. And that Non est in potestate Ecclesiae instituere Sac^^ficium.
Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 28. p. ^19. Idem al^bi, v^de supra at (h)
It is not in the power of the Church to ordain a Sacrifice. Next, that if any
Sacrifice had been instituted, it must have appeared either by some word, or
Act of Christ, neither of which can be found, or yet any shadow thereof. What
then (we pray you) can make more both for the justifying of your own Bishop of
Bitontum, who feared not to publish in your Council of Trent, before all their
Father-hoods, Quidam bitontinus Episcopus in Conc. Trid. (ut Canus and Alii
re^erunt) tentavit defendere, Christum (...) n^cte Coenae non obtulisse
Sacrificium. Suarez q. s^p. disp. 74. Sect. 2. p. 949.
That Christ in his last Supper did not offer up any proper Sacrifice? As also
for the condemning of your own Romish Church for a Sacrilegious Depravation of
the Sacrament of Christ? Upon this their Exigence whither will they now? To
other Scriptures of the new Testament, and then of the old. Out of the new are
the two that follow.

CHAP. II.
That the other objected Scriptures, out of the new Testament, make not for any
Proper Sacrifice among Christians, to wit, not Acts 13. 2. of [(...).]

SECT. I.

Cardinals translate, They sacrificing. But why Sacrificing, say we, and not
some other ministerial Function, as preaching, or administering the Sacrament,
seeing that the words may bear it? They answer us, because 1. This Ministry
is said to be done To the Lord, so is not Preaching. 2. For that the word
[(...)] whenever it is applied to sacred Ministry and used absolutely, it
is always taken for the Act of Sacrificing. So they. When we should have
answered this Objection, we found our selves prevented by one, who for
Greeke-learning has sca^ had his equal in this our age, namely, that Casa^box

Phoenix M. Isaac Casaubon. Look upon the Margent, where you may find the
word, (...), to have been used Ecclesiastically for whatsoever religious
ministration, (even for sole Praying, where there is no note or occasion of
Sacrifice) and he instanceth in the Fathers, mentioning the Morning and Evening
(...) of the Church. But you will not say (we think) that there was any
proper Evening Sacrifice in use in those times.

What can you say for your Cardinal his former lavish assertion, who is thus
largely confuted? Nay, how shall you justify your selves, who are bound by
Oath not to gainsay in your Disputations the Vulgar Latin Translation, which
has rendered the same Greek words [(...),] Ministrantibus eis, that is, They
ministering, and not, They sacrificing? which might be said as well of
preaching, praying, administering the Sacrament; all which (to me^t with your
other Objection) being done according to the will of God, and belonging to his
worship and service, might be properly said to have been done unto God.

That the Second objected place out of the new Testament, to wit, 1 Cor. 10.
cannot infer any Proper Sacrifice.

SECT. II.
1. Cor. 10. 18. BEhold Israel -- are not they who cat of the Sacrifices
partakers of the Altar? then verse. 20, 21, 22. But that which the Gentiles
offer they offer to Devils, and not unto God, and I would not have you
partakers with Devils: ye cannot drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the cup
of Devils: you cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and the table of
Devils. Hence Bellarmine; Postremum Argumentum ex Scripturis habetur, 1 Cor.
10. Ubi primo Mensa Domini comparatur cum Altari Gentilium. Ergo, Mensa Domini
est quoddam Altar, and proinde Eucharistia Sacrificium. 2. Ita vult

Here (says he) the Table of the Lord is compared with the Altar of the
Gentiles: Therefore is the Table of the Lord certainly an Altar, and therefore
it has a Sacrifice. 2. Because the Eucharist is so offered, as were the
Sacrifices of the Jews. And 3. Because he that eats the Eucharist is said so
to be partaker of the Lord's Altar, as the Heathen of things sacrificed to
Idols are said to be partakers of the Idols Altar. So he; following only his
own sense, and not regarding the voice or judgment of any other. If we should
say, in Answer to his first Objection, that your Cardinal wanted his
spectacles, in reading of the Text, when he said that the Apostle compares
the Table of the Lord, whereon the Eucharist is placed* with the Altar of the
Gentiles (which was the Altar of Devils) it were a friendly answer in his
behalf* for the words of the Text expressly relate a Comparison of the Table
of the Lord with the Table of Gentiles, and Devils; and not with their Altar.
And although the Heathen had their Altars, yet (which crosses all the former
Objections) their common Eating of things sacrificed unto Idols was not upon
Altars, but upon Tables, in feasting and partaking of the Idolothytes, and not
in Sacrificing, as did also the Aenaeid. 8. p^st Sacrificium Aenaeas invitat^
estad Epulas.
Gentiles.

The whole scope of the Apostle is to dehort all Christians from communicating
with the Heathen in their Idol Solemnities whatsoever; and the sum of his
Argument is, that whosoever is Partaker of any Ceremony, made essential to any
worship professed, he makes himself a partaker of the profession it self,
whether it be Christian, verse. 16. or Jewish, verse. 18. or Heathenish and
Devilish, verse. 20. And again; the Apostle's Argument does as well agree with
a Religious Table, as with an Altar; with a Sacrament, as with a Sacrifice, and
so it seems your Aquinas. Non potestis Calicem Domini bibere and Daemoniorum
^ul.] Quoad Sacramentum sanguinis. Non potestis mensae Domini participes esse,
quoad Sacramentum corporis, and mensae Daemoniorum. In 1 Cor. 10.
Aquinas thought, who paraphraseth thus upon the Text; You cannot be partakers
of the Table of the Lord, in respect of the Sacrament of the Lords Body, and of
the table of Devils. To an Objector, who avoucheth no Father for his
Assertion, it may be sufficient for us to oppose, albeit but any one. Primasius
therefore, expounding this Scripture, makes the Comparison to stand thus: See
above Book 5. Chap. 8. Sect. 3. at the letter (i).
As our Savior said; He that eats my flesh abides in me, so the eating of
the Bread of Idols is to be partakers of the Devils. But this participation of
Devils must needs be spiritual, and not corporal; you know the Consequence.

CHAP. III.
That no Scripture in the old Testament has been justly produced, for proof
of a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist.

THe Places of Scripture, selected by your Disputers, are partly Typical, and
partly Prophetical.

That the first objected Typical Scripture, concerning Melchisedech, makes
not for proof of a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist.

SECT. I.
The State of the Question.

WE are loath to trouble you with Dispute about the end of Melchisedech his
ministering Bread and Wine to Abraham, and his Company; whether it were as a
matter of Sacrifice unto God, or (as Diverse have thought) only of refreshing
the weary Soldiers of Abraham; because the Question is brought to be tried by
the judgment of such Fathers, who have called it a Sacrifice. Wherefore we
yield unto you the full scope, and suppose (with your Bellarm. lib. 1. de
Missa, cap. 6.
Cardinal) that the Bread and Wine brought forth had been sacrificed by
Melchisedech to God, and not as a Sacrifice administered by him to his Guests.
Now, because whatsoever shall be objected will concern either the matter of
Sacrifice, or else the Priesthood and office of the Sacrificer, we are orderly
to handle them both.

That the Testimonies of the Fathers, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice in the
Eucharist, from the Type of Melchisedech's Sacrifice, are Sophistically, and
unconscionably objected out of Psalm. 110. and Heb. 5.

SECT. II.
SOme of the objected Testimonies (See the Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. ex
Ambrosio. Panem and Vinum obtulit. De Sacram. lib. 5. cap. 1. Quod to^o orb

lib. 10. cap. 19. Visibile Sacrificium. In his Liturgy, Tract. 3.
Margent) comparing the Sacrifice of Melchisedech to the Eucharist, in the name
of a Sacrifice, do relate no further than Bread and Wine, calling these
Materials, The Sacrifice of Christians: such are the Testimonies of Ambrose,
Augustine, Chrysostom, Theophylact, O^cumenius, and Cassiodore, together with
two Jewish Rabbis; promising that at the coming of Christ all Sacrifices
should cease, Except the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine in the Eucharist. This is
your first Collection, for proof that the Eucharist is a Proper Visible
Sacrifice. But first Unconscionably, knowing and See hereafter Chap. 5. Sect. 1.
confessing it to be no better than a Jewish Conceit, to think the Bread and
Wine to be properly a Sacrifice of the new Testament. Wherefore, to labor to
prove a Proper Sacrifice, in that which you know and acknowledge to be no
Proper Sacrifice, do you not blush? How much better had it becomne you to have
understood the Fathers to have used the word Sacrifice in a large sense, as it
might signify any sacred ministration, as Isidore does instruct you? Who, if
you ask what it is, which Christ^ans do now offer after the order of
Melchisedech? he will say, that it is Bread and Wine. Isidor. Victimas jam, non
q^ales Judaei, sed quales Melchisedech offerunt credentes: Id est, Panem and
Vinum. i. e. corporis and sanguinis Sacramen^um. Lib de Vocat. Gent. cap. 26.
That is (says he) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood. Even as Jerome long
before him; Hieron. Epist. ad Evag. Pane and vino simplice, puroque Sacrificio
Christo dedicaverit Sacramentum.
Melchisedech in Bread and Wine did dedicate the Sacrament of Christ:
distinguishing both the Sacrament from a Proper Sacrifice, and naming the
thing, that is said in a sort to be offered, Not to be the Body and Blood of
Christ, but the Sacrament of both.

Your second kind of objected Sentences of Fathers do indeed compare the
Bread and Wine of Melchisedech with the Body and Blood of Christ in the
Eucharist. In this Rank we reckon the Cyprian. lib. 2. Epist. 3. ad Cecil.
Christus idem quod Melchisedech panem and vi^um, idem sc. suum Corpus and
Sanguinem. Eusebius. Caesar. lib. 5. Demonstr. cap. 3. Sacerdotes v^no and pane,
and Corporis and Sanguinis ejus mysteria repraesentant, quae sane mysteria
Melchisedech tanto ante Sp^ divino cognoverat. Hieron. Epist. ad Marcell.
Melchisedech in Typo Christi Panem and Vinumobtulit, and Mysterium Christianum
in Salvator^s sangume and Corpore dedicavit. Et Quaest. in Genes. Melchisedech
obl^to pane and vino, i. e. Corpore and Sanguine Domini Jesu. Eucher. Lugdun.
lib. 2. c. 18. in Genesis Vt O^lationem Panis and Vini, i. e. Corporis and
Sanguinis ejus Sacramentum in Sacrificium Christus inst^r illus [Melchiz.]
offerens, panem and vinum, carnem viz. and sanguinem suum. H^c Bellarm. lib. 1.
de M^ssa, cap. 6.
Testimonies of Cyprian, Hierome, Eusebius, and Eucherius, saying that
Melchisedech himself offered up the Body and Blood of Christ in this
Sacrifice: which Body and Blood of Christ you will All swear (we dare say) was
not the proper Subject matter of the Sacrifice of Melchisedech, who performed
his Sacrifice many thousands of years before our Lord Christ was incarnate in
the flesh, to take unto him either Body, or Blood. And therefore could not the
Fathers understand, by the Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood, any thing but
the Type of Christ his Body and Blood; these being then the Object of
Melchisedech's faith, as the cited Sentences of Hierome and Eusebius do
declare. Which is a second proof of the unconscionable dealing of your
Disputers, by enforcing Testimonies against common sense.

But will you see furthermore the Unluckiness of your game, and that three
manner of ways? First, your ordinary guize is to object the word Sacrifice
out of the Fathers, as properly used, whereas your Allegations tell us that
they used it in a greater latitude, and at liberty. Secondly, and more
principally, wheresoever you hear the Fathers naming Bread and Wine the Body
and Blood of Christ, o then behold Transubstantiation of Bread into Christ his
Body; and behold it is Corporal presence, and that most evidently! this is your
common shout. And yet behold in your own objected Sentences of Fathers, that
which was most really Bread and Wine of Melchisedech, was notwithstanding by
the forenamed Fathers called the Body and Blood of Christ: A most evident
Argument that the Fathers understood Christ's words, in calling Bread his Body,
figuratively.

That the Apostle to the Hebrews, in comparing Melchisedech with Christ, did
not intimate any Analogy between the Sacrifice of Melchisedech, and of the
Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist.

But, Bellarm. Non videtur po^se negari, etc. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6..

you pre-occupate, viz. The Apostle, speaking of Melchisedech, says, [Of whom
I had much to say, and that which is uninterpretable, because you are dull of
hearing.] Chap. 5. verse. 11. Whence it may seem (says vour Cardinal) a thing
undeniable, that the Apostle meant thereby the mystery of the Eucharist,
because it was above their capacity, and therefore he purposely forbear to
mention either Bread or Wine. So your Answerer. To whom you may take, for a
Reply as in our behalf, the Confession of your much-esteemed Jesuit Ribera,
who tells you that Ribera Jes. Id non ideo dixerat, quod sermonem illum
tacere vellet, erat enim id, id quod in hac Epistola agit, valde accommodatum,
sed ut magis illos excitaret studio audiendi, and intentiores redderet -- Non
desperate Paulus quae scripturus est posse ab illis percipi, si animum
attendant, aut certe a nonnullis eorum, qui eruditiores erant, per quos coeteri
etiam paulatim intelligerent. Com. in Heb. 6. number. 1. Where also he has these
words: Cum ^llorum and imbecillitatem and tarditatem accusat, ideirco facit, ut
pudore ad melius intelligenda incitarentur: [Missa nunc faciamus rudimenta, and
ad perfectionem feramur.] Hoc est, Date operam ut mecum intelligatis, quae
perfectis dici solent.
The Apostle naming it a thing Inexplicable, and calling them Dull, meant not
thereby to conceal the matter employed (which was so pertinent to that he had
in hand) from them, because of the want of their Capacity: but did, in so
saying, rather excite them to a greater Attention; showing thereby that he did
not despair, but that they were capable of that which he would say; at least
the learned among them, by whom others might have learned by little and little.
So he, proving the same out of those words of the Apostle, [Passing by the
Rudiments, etc. Let us go on unto perfection:] that is, (says he) Do your
diligence in hearing, that you may attain unto the understanding of these
things, which are delivered unto those that are perfect. This is the Brief of
his large Comment hereupon. Notwithstanding, what our Opposites fail of, in
the point of Sacrifice, They intend to gain from the Title of Priesthood.

Of the Priesthood of Melchisedech, as it is compared with the pretended Romish
Priesthood, out of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

SECT. IV.
The State of the Question.

Aarons Priesthood (said your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. ex Epip^anio.
Sacrificium crucis peractum est, ergo aliud Sacrificium esse oportet, quod
jugiter offeratur -- Ig^ur necesse est in Ecclesia veram Sacrificandi actionem
admittere; quae Christo summo Sacerdoti per Ministros suos tribuatut, qualis

Ibid.. Respondeo autem. Proprie tamen non dicitur Sacrificium aeternum, quod

Cardinal) is transla^ed into the Priesthood of Melchizedech, and this into
the Priesthood of Christ, [A Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedech:]
which, because it is perpetual and eternal, cannot be performed properly by
Christ himself, and therefore must be executed by his Ministers, ^s Vicars on
earth. So he, accordingly as your Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. C. 1. Christus Sacerdos
secundum ordinem Melchisedech; and si semel obtulit in cruce, ut aeternam
redemptionem operaretur: quia tamen p^r mortem ejus Sacerdotium extinguendum
non erat etc.
Council of Trent has decreed. Insomuch that M. Sanders will have the whole
Ministry of the new Testament to issue Novi Testamenti ministerium jam inde a
Melchizedech petitum, jam and Christus voluit secundum ejus ordinem dic^*
Sacerdos, and Presbyteri sunt Ministri Christi, i. e. ejus, qui fuit Sacerdos
secundum ordinem Melchizedech. Sand. de Visi^. Monar^^. lib. 1. page 20.. Quae
cum.
Originally from Melchizedech. This is a matter of great moment, as will
appear; which we shall resolve by o^rtaine Positions.

The foundation of all the Doctrine, concerning Christ and Melchizedech, is set
down in the Epistle to the Hebrews.

That the Analogy between Melchizedech his Priesthood, and the eternal
Priesthood of Christ in himself, is most perfect, and so declared to be, Heb.
5, 6, 7, Chapp.

SECT. V.
THe holy Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, comparing the Type
Melchizedech with the Arch-Type Christ Jesus, in one order of Priesthood,
shows between Both an absolute Analogy, although not in equality of
Excellence, yet in similitude of qualities and offices. As first in Royalty,
Melchizedech is called The King of Justice and Peace. So Christ (but infinitely
more) is called Our Justice and Peace. Secondly, Melchizedech, in respect of
Generation, was without Generation from Father or Mother (according to the
formalitie of Sacred Story:) so Christ, according to the verity of his
Humanity, without Father; and, in his divine nature, without Mother: of whom
also it is written, Who shall declare his Generation? Thirdly, in Time,
Melchizedech a Priest for ever, having neither beginning nor end of Days
(according to the same Historical Tenure:) so Christ an eternal Priest, Chap.
5, 6. Fourthly, in Number, only One, who had no Predecessor, nor Successor. So
Christ, who acknowledged no such Priest before him, nor shall find any other
after him for ever. Fifthly, Christ was Universally King and Priest, as the
Apostle noted, Chap. 7. 4. saying, That the Priesthood was changed from Aaron
and Levi to Christ, in Judah. That is, that Christ's Power might be both Regal,
and Sacerdotall, says Mutatum Sacerdotium de Sacerdotali in Regalem, ut eadem
ipsa sit Regalis and Sacerdotalis. Chrysostom in Heb. 7. Horn. 13. Fuit in
Melchizedech singularis dignitas, quod Sacerdotium administrabatur per Regem.
Test Greg. Valent. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 4.
Chrysostom; which was a singular dignity, as your Jesuit well observes.

That the nature of every other Priesthood (be it of your Romish High Priest)
dissenteth as much from the Priesthood of Melchizdech, as the Priesthood of
Melchizedech agrees with the Priesthood of Christ.

SECT. VI.
IF Comparison might be made of Priesthood, whom would you rather that we
should instance in, than in your entitled Summus Pontifex, that is, the High
Priest, your Pope: who notwithstanding cannot be said to be a King, as
Melchizedech, much less as Christ, Bellarm. Regnum spirituale Christo
proprium: -- item Regnum divinum universale, ratione Hypostaticae Vnionis; item
gloriae in Beatitudine: Temporale terrenum Christo conveniebat. Lib. Recog.
page 28.
Everlasting. Secondly, Much less a King of Peace, who has been reproved by
Antiquity for being Victor, Pacis perturbator. Irenam apud ^useb. Hist. lib.
5. cap. 24.
A Troubler of the Peace of Christ's Church: And generally complained of by
others, as being Non tantum contra Barbaros, sed etia^ ejusdem patriae,
sanguinis, and fidei Principes Domini nostri Dei pacis minus pacifici Vicarii.
Esp^nc. in 1. Tim. digress. lib. 2. cap. 6. page 273.
Nothing less than the Vicar of the God of Peace, because of his raising
hostile wars against Princes of the same Nation, Blood, and Faith: And for
Leodiens. Epist. ad Paulum 2. de Greg. Septimo; Novello schismate Regnum and
Sacerdotium scindeba^. Test Espencaeo q^ sup.
Distracting the Estates of Princedome and Priestdome. Thirdly, not King of
Justice, because some Popes have excited Subjects and Sons to rebel against
their Liege Sovereigns and Parents. Fourthly, not Originally without
Generation, by either Father or Mother; some of them having been borne in
lawful wedlock, and of known honest Parents: albeit of other-some the
mothers side has been much the surer.

It will be no Answer to say, as Pope Non secundum ordinem Aaron, cujus
Sacerdotium per propaginem sui seminis in ministerio temporali fuit, and cum
Veteris Testamenti Lege cessavit: sed secundu^ ordinem Melchizedech, in quo
aetorni Pontificis forma praecessit. Leo Papa Sermon. 2. in. Annivers. die
Assumpt. ad Pontif.
Leo in effect did, viz. that, as Priests, you are not as were the Leviticall;
by natural propagation; but by a spiritual ordination: because a spiritual
Propagation is no proper, but a metaphorical Generation. Fifthly, not without
Succession; seeing that Succession, as from Saint Peter, is the chief tenure
of your Priesthood. Nor will that of Epiphanius help you, in this Case, to
say that Nunc sane non amplius semen secundum successionem eligitur, sed forma
juxta virtutem quaeritur. Epiphaa. cont. H^r^s. 55.
You had no Succession by the seed of Aaron: because although this may exempt
you from the Leviticall Priesthood, yet will not it associate you with the
Priesthood of Melchizedech, or of Christ, whose Characters of Priesthood was
to be Priests soly, individually, and absolutely in themselves.

As little can your ordinary Answer avail, telling us that you are not
Salmeron Ies. Nos in Christo Sacerdotes sumus tanquam Vicarii -- Satis est
nobis illum Principem semper vivere. Com. in Heb. cap. 10. Disp. 19.
Successors, but Vicars of Christ, and Successors of Peter; because, whilst
you claim that the Visible Priesthood and Sacrifice of Christ is still in the
Church, which is perpetuated by Succession, you must bid farewell to the
Priesthood of Melchizedech. But if indeed you disclaim all Succession of
Christ, why is your Jesuit licensed to say, that your Ribera. Successor quidem
Christo Petrus, and reliqui post cum Pontifices in officio gubernandi
Ecclesiam, and pascendi oves Christi Verbo praedicationis, and Sacramentorum
Administratione. At non successit in officio redemptionis, and Pontificis per
se Deum iratum placantis -- in quo non sunt Successores, sed Ministri Christi.
In Heb. 10. number. 8.
Roman Popes do succeed Christ in their Pastorship over the Church, although
not in their Priesthood by offering Sacrifices, expiating sins by their own
virtue? Are not the titles of Pastor and Priest equally transcendent in Christ?
Sixthly, not in respect of the no-necessity of a Succession, which was
Immortality, because the Popes showed themselves to be sufficiently mortal,
insomuch that one Pope maligning another, after death has dragged the Carcass
of his Predecessor out of his Platina in Vitis Sergii 3. Formos^, Stephans,
Christopheri.
Grave; to omit their other like barbarous outrages. Seventhly, not Personal
Sanctity, Heb. 7. 23.
Holy; impolluted, and separated from sins. For whosoever, being merely man,
shall arrogate to himself to be without sin, the holy Ghost will give him
the Heb. 7. 26.
Lie. As for your Popes, we wish you to make choice of whatsoever Historians
you please, and we doubt not but you shall find upon record, that many of them
are noted to have been as impious and mischievous in their lives, and in their
deaths as infamous and cursed, as they were contrarily Bonifaces, Innocents, or
Benedicts in their names. Can there be then any Analogy between your high
Roman Priest and Christ, the Prototype to Melchizedech, in so manifold
Repugnances? Yet notwithstanding, every (*) 1 Io^. 1. 8.
one of you must be (forsooth) a Priest after the order of Melchizedeck.

Nay, but (not to multiply many words) the Novelty of your Pretense does bewray
it self from Lombard. de Ordinat. Pr^sb. Accipiunt etiam calicem cum vino, and
patinam cum Hostiis, ut sciant se accipisse potestatem placabiles Deo hostias
offerendi. Hic ordo a filiis Aaron sumpsit initium. etc. Lib. 4. Distinct. 24.
lit. 1.
Peter Lombard, Master of the Romish School, who Anno 1145. taught (how truly
look you to that) that every Priest at his Ordination, in taking the Chalice
with wine, and platter with the Host, should understand that his power of
sacrificing was from The order of Aaron. Nor may you think that this was his
private opinion, for He (says your P. Lombardus collegit sententias
Theologorum, and Magister Theologorum scholasticorum dici meruit. Lib. de
Script. Eccles. T^t. Petrus Lombardus.
Cardinal of him) collected the sentences of Divines, and deserved to be
called the Master of Schoolmen. Thus far of the Person of Christ, as Priest;
in the next place we are to enquire into his Priestly function.

Of the Function of Christ his Priesthood, now after his Ascension into
Heaven; and your Cardinal his Doctrine sacrilegiously detracting from it.

SECT. VII.
BY the doctrine of your Cardinal, in the name of your Church, Bellarm. Crucis
Sacrificium non est perpetuum, sed effectum ejus -- nec dicitur aeternum quod
non jugiter sacrificatur -- non in coelis jam Sacerdos per solam orationem, nec
mediante oblatione Victimae, quia tum necesse est eum semper offerre. -- Ergo
Eucharistia and Sacrificium quod jugiter offertur -- Oblatio in coelis non est
proprie dictum Sacrificium -- ergo non est vere ac proprie Sacerdos, cum verum
ac proprium Sacrificium offerre non potest. Lib. 1. de Missa, c. 6. sparsim.
And, -- Christus non sacrificat nunc per se visibiliter, nisi in Eucharistia.
Bellar. ibid. cap. 25.. Quod autem. And, Sacrificium crucis, respect Christi^
norum. Ibid. cap. 20. And, Per Ministros suos perpetuo sacrificat seipsum in
Eucharistia: hoc enim solummodo perpetuu^ habet Sacerdotium. Bellarm. ibid.
cap. cod. ad finem.
The old Priesthood of Aaron was translated into the Priesthood of Christ:
Every Priest (says the Apostle) must have some thing to offer, else he were no
Priest. Thus his Priesthood is called Eternal, and must have a perpetual
offering, which was not that upon the Cross. Nor can that suffice, which the
Protestants say, That his Preist-hood is perpetual, because of the perpetual
virtue of his sacrifice upon the Cross; or because of his perpetual Act of
Intercession, as Priest in Heaven; or of presenting his passion to his Father
in Heaven, whither his Priesthood was translated. No, but it is certain that
Christ cannot now properly sacrifice by himself, He does it by his Ministers
in the Eucharist, Because the sacrifice of the Cross, in respect of
Christians, is now invisible, and seen only by Faith: which although it be a
more true sacrifice, yet it is not, as our Adversaries say, the only sacrifice
of Christian Religion, nor sufficient for the Conservation thereof. And again,
His sacrificing of himself in the Sacrament, by his Ministers, is that by
which only ^e is said to have a perpetual Priesthood. Accordingly your
Cardinal Alan. Christus in ipso coelo non aliquid Sacerdotale facit, nisi
respectu nostri Sacramenti, quod ipse per nostrum ministerium efficit continuo
and offert. Lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 8.. Reliqua.
Alan; Christ (says he) performs no Priestly function in Heaven, but with
relation to our Ministry here on earth, whereby he offers. So they for the
dignifying of their Romish Mass, as did also Rhemists. Christ his Priesthood
consists in the perpetual offering of Christ his Body and Blood in the
Church. Annot. in Heb. 7. 17.
your Rhemists; but with what Eclipse of Judgment and good Conscience, is now
to be declared.

If we take the Sacrifice of Christ for the proper Act of Sacrificing, which is
destructive; so was Christ his Sacrifice but One, and Once, Heb. 7. and 8. But
understanding it as the subject matter of the same Sacrifice, once so offered
to God upon the Cross, and after his Ascension entered into Heaven, and so is
it a perpetual Sacrifice presentative before God. For as the High Priest of
the Law, after the Sacrifice was killed, entered into the holy place once a
year, but not without Blood, Heb. 9. 7. so Christ having purchased an eternal
redemption, by his Death upon the Cross, went into the holy place (of Heaven)
with the same his own blood. V. 12. To what end? Always living to make
supplication for us. Chapter 7. V. 3. and 25.

Hence follows the continual use, which the souls of the faithful have, of
his immediate function in Heaven: Having a perpetual Priesthood, he is able
continually to save them that come to God by him. V. 24, 25. Whence issues our
boldness and allconfidence, always to address our prayers to him, or by him
unto God: We having an high Priest over the house of God, let us draw near
with a true heart, infull assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from
an evil Conscience. Chapter 10. 22. The evidence of these Scriptures has drawn
from your Jesuit Ribera (even then, when he professes himself an earnest
defender of your Roman Mass) these Acknowledgements following Ribera Ies. in
his Comment upon the places alleged, Chap. 7. 23. Chap. 8. 2, and 3. Chap. 9.
23. His Book is familiar with you, where you may peruse the places.
viz. upon the Chapter 7. 23. That Christ is a true Priest, and all other do
partake of his Priesthood, in offering sacrifice, only in remembrance of his
Sacrifice: And that he did not perform the office of Priesthood only upon
earth, but even now also in heaven: which function he now discharges by the
virtue of his Sacrifice upon the Cross. He proceeds. No man (says he) will
deny this Position (namely) that Christ now ever exercizeth the office of a
Priest, by presenting himself for us. So he.

This is still Christ's function of Priesthood, whereunto this Apostle
exhorts all Christians, at all times of need to make their address; which
Saint John propounds as the only Anchor-hold of Faith in his Propitiation, 1.
John 2. If any sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous, and he is (what?) The Propitiation for our sins. The which every
faithful Christian does apply, by faith, unto himself, as often as he prays
to God, in Christ's name, for the remission of sins, saying, Through Jesus
Christ our Lord. How therefore can this his function of Priesthood, without
extreme sacrilege, be held Insufficient to his Church, for obtaining pardon
immediately from God, who sees not? As for other your ordinary Objections,
taken from two sentences of the Apostle, speaking of the Examples of things
celestial, and of Purging sins now with better Sacrifices, you should not
have troubled us with them, knowing them to be satisfied by your own Authors

Objected by Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6.
alleged by you, as denying that Christ now offers any thing by himself,
but only in the Church: albeit he says not so, simply; but, that he offers
not in the Church personally, which all confess: for otherwise Theodoret
presently after His words immediately following are these: Et propterea
Sacerdotio fungitus ut homo: recipit autem ea quae offeruntur ut Dens. Offert
autem Ecclesia Corporis and ejus sanguinis symbola. So Theod.
expresses, that Christ exercises his Priesthood still as man. As for the
Church, his words are not, that She offers the Body and Blood of Christ in
Sacrifice, but, The Symbols of his Body and Blood. Therefore is this his
Testimony unworthily and unconscionably objected. But we will consult with the
direct speeches of Antiquity. 1. If you ask of the Offering, Ambrose answers
you, that Ambros. Nunc Christus offertur, hic in Imagine, ibi in veritate, ubi
apud Patr^ Auvocatus p^o Nobis. Lib. 1. d^offic. cap. 48. sub fi^em.
The offering of Christ here below is but in an image: but his offering with
the Father is in truth. If of the Priest, Augustine tells you, Aug. in Psalm
94. Impo^us in ara Sacrificium, quando Deum laudamus: at vero Sacerdotem si
requiras, super coelos est, interpellat p^o te, qu^ terris mortuus est pro te.
The Priest is to be sought for in heaven, even He, who on earth suffered
Death for thee. There is some difference then sure.

As little reason have your Disputers to object that one and only Testimony of
Augustine, Aug. lib. 20. de Civit. cap. 10. Episcopi and Presbyterr (inquit)
sunt proprie Sacerdotes. Bellarm. obji^it. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 17
Presbyteri proprie Sacerdotes: which ho^pake not absolutely, but comparatively
(namely) in respect of Lay-Christians, who in Scripture are otherwise called
Priests. (As your own Duplex Sacerdotium, alterum Interius, omnium fidelium,
qui aqua salutari abluti sunt, Apoc. 1. 16. -- alterum Exterius tantum eorum,
qui externo Sacramento ordinis ad aliquod proprium, sacrumque ministerium
as^untur. Catechis. Romans par. 2. de Ordine, number. 22.
Catechism distinguishes, calling the former the Inward, which only the
Faithful have by the Sacrament of Baptism; the other Outward, by the
Sacrament of Orders.) And with the like liberty does Saint Augustine call the
Sacrifice of the old Testament (although most proper) but a Sign, in respect
of the Spiritual Sacrifice of this work of mercy; which he Aug. ibid. In
Apo^. 20. 6. [Sed erunt Sacerdotes Christi, and regnabunt cum Eo, etc.] Non
utique de solis Episcopis aut Presbyteris dictum est, qui proprie jam vocantur
in Ecclesia Sacerdotes: sed sicut omnes Christianos dicimus propter mysticum
Chrisma, sic omnes Sacerdotes, quia membra unius Sacerdotis, etc. [For there is
a double Reason of naming Christians Priests; one is in general, because of
their offering up spiritual Sacrifices of Prayers, and Praises to God, 1 Pet.
2. 5. And another is in special, by public Function, commending the same
spiritual Sa^es, in public Service, in the name of the Church. And s^,
according to the s^ e^ of terming them properly Priests, wherewith before (as
you have heard) in comparing Alms with the Iew^sh Sacrifice, he called Alms
the true Sacrifice, and the other but The sign of it^ notwithstanding the
bodily Sacrifice of the Jews was, in propriety of Speech, The true Sacrifice,
other but Analogicall.]
calls True, namely in the Truth of Excellency, although not of propriety, as
you may see. And lastly, here you have urged one, than whom there is scarcely
found among Protestants a greater Adversary to your fundamental Article of
your Sacrifice, which is the Corporal existence of Christ in the Eucharist.
All which notwithstanding, the dignity of our Evangelicall function is nothing
lessened, but much more amplified by this comparison.

If furthermore we speak of the Altar, you will have it to be rather on earth
below, and to that end you object that Scripture, Heb. 13. 10. We have [(...)]
that is, an Altar (says the Apostle) whereof they have no right to eat, that
serve at the Tabernacle. This ^s in their A^^otat. upon the place: and M.
Breerly in his Book of the Liturgy Tract. 3. Sect. 3. Subd 4.
some of you greedily catch at, for proof of a proper Sacrifice in the Mass,
and are presently repulsed by your Aquinas. Istud altar ve^ est crux Christi,
in qua Christus immolatus est, vel ipse Christus in quo, and per quem preces
nostras offerimus: and hoc est Altar a^um, de quo Apoc. 8. Com. in hunc locum.
Aquinas, expounding the place to signify Either his Altar upon the Cross, or
else his Body, as his Altar in Heaven: mentioned Apoc. 8. and called The golden
Altar. If we our selves should tell you, how some one affirms that This
Altar, spoken of by the Apostle, is the Body of Christ himself in Heaven, upon
which, and by which all Christians are to offer up their spiritual Sacrifices
of Faith, Devotion, Thankfulness, Hope, and Charity; you would presently
answer, that This one certainly is some Lutheran or Calvinist, the words are so
contradictory to your Romish Garb: notwithstanding you may find all this in
the Antididag. Coloniens. de Missae Sacrificio.. P^sthac. -- [Habemus Altare]
Heb. 13. and Apoc. 8. [Aureum altar,] in q^o, and pe^ quod omnes Christiani
universa Sacrificia spiritual^a fidei, devotionis, gratiarum actionis, spei,
and charitatis Deo Patri debent osterre. -- Atque ita fit, ut Christus sit
altar, Sacerdos, and Sacrificium. August. lib. 10. de Trinitate.
Antididagma of the Divines of Collen. And your Argument drawn from the word
Altar, in this Scripture, is so feeble and lame a Soldier, that your Bellarm.
Quia non desunt ex Catholicis, qui interpretantur hunc locum vel de Cruce, vel
de Christo ipso; non urgeo eum. Lib. 1. de Misso, cap. 14.
Cardinal was content to leave it behind him, because Many Catholics (says
he) interpret it otherwise.

But we are cited to consult with the Ancient Fathers, be it so. If then we
shall demand where our high Priest Christ Jesus is, to whom a man in fasting
must repair, Origin. Jejunans debes adire Pontificem tuum Christum, qui utique
non in terris quaerendus est, sed in coelis: Et per Ipsum debes offerre Hostiam
Deo. In Levit. cap. 16. Hom. 10.
Origin resolves us, saying, He is not to be sought here on earth at all, but
in Heaven. If a Bishop be so utterly hindered by persecution, that he cannot
partake of any Sacramental Altar on earth, Gregory Nazianzen will fortify
him, as he did himself, saying, Greg. Nazian. Si ab his Al^bus me ar^^bunt, at
aliud habeo, cujus figurae sunt ea, quae nec oculis cernimus, super q^od nec
as^ia* nec manus asc^, nec ullum Artificum instiumentum auditum est; sed men^is
hoc opus est, huic que per contemplationem astabo, in hoc gratum immolabo
Sacrificium, oblationes and Holocausta, [(...)] tanto praestantiora, quanto
Veritas un bra. Oral. 28. page 484.
I have another Altar in Heaven, whereof these (Altars) are but signs; a
better Altar, to be beholden with the eyes of my mind, theye will I offer up my
oblations: as great a Difference (doubtless) as between Signs and Things.
This could not he have said of those Altars, if the Sacrifices on them both
were, as you pretend, subjectively and corporally the same. If we would know
how, what, and where the thing is, which a Christian man ought to contemplate
upon, when he is exercised in this our Eucharisticall Sacrifice? Chris^st. in
1. Cor. 10. Hom. 24. ^^ud sane tremenuum Sacrificium, ut cum concordia ad illud
ac^^damus, ut Aquilae sacti ad ipsum coelum evolemus: ubi enim cadaver, ibi
aquilae. Cadaver Domini corpus, propter mortem: Aquilas autem non oportet ad
inferiora trahi aut repere, sed ad superiora volare, and solemn justuiae intuer^
oculo mentis acutissimo. Aq^ilarum enim haec men^a est, non Graculorum.
Chrysostom is ready to instruct him, Not to play the Chough or Iay, in fixing
his thoughts here below, but as the Eagle to ascend thither where the Body is,
namely (for so he says) in Heaven. According to that of the Apostle, Heb. 10.
Christ sitting at the right hand of God. V. 12. What therefore? Therefore let
us draw near with an Assurance of faith. V. 22.

If we would understand wherein the difference of the Jewish Religion and
Christian Profession especially consists, in respect of Priesthood, Aug.
adversus Iudaeos, cap. 9. Nam and Aaron and Sacerdotiu^ jam nullum est, in
aliquo templo, and Christi Sacerdotium est aeternum in coelo.
Augustine tells us that They have no Priesthood; and the Priesthood of
Christ is eternal in Heaven. And the holy Fathers give us some Reasons for
these and the like Resolutions. For if any would know the Reason why we must
have our Confidence in the Celestial Priest, Sacrifice, and Altar; Oecumen. in
Heb. 10. super haec verba, [Cum certitudine fidei.] Cum deinceps nihil visibile
supersit, neque Templum, hoc est coelum; neque Pontifex, id est, Christus;
neque Hostia, quae Corpus illius est, fide deinceps opus est.
Oecumenius and Ambros. in Heb. 10. Cum fiducia, ait Apostolus: nihil enim hic
visibile, neque Sacerdos, neque Sacrificium, neque Altar.
Ambrose will show us that it is because Here below there is nothing visible;
neither Temple, ours being in Heaven; nor Priest, our being Christ; nor
Sacrifice, ours being his Body; nor yet Altar, says the other. Hear your own
Canus: Canus loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. Oblatio, quam Christus in coelis
incruentum fecit. page 421.
Christ offers an unbloody Oblation in Heaven. Thus in respect of the place
of Residence of Christ our high Priest, and his Function, which has been
already confirmed by the Fathers of the first Council of Nice. And thus far
of the place of this Altar the Throne of Grace; something would be spoken in
respect of Time.

That the former Sacrilegious Derogation, from Christ's Priestly Function in
Heaven, is contradicted by Scriptures and Fathers, in respect of the Time of
the execution thereof.

SECT. IX.
CHrist his bodily existence in Heaven (as we have See above Chap. 3. Sect. 9.
heard) is set out by the Apostle in these terms: He abides a Priest for us.
He continues a Priest. He having a continual Priesthood. He, without
intermission, appears before God for us. Thus the Apostle. But what of this,
will you say? Do but mark. Are you not All heard still proclaiming, as with
one voice, that your Romish Sacrifice of the Mass is the only (...), and
Barredas. Quod singulis diebus Christus offert incruente, Hoc juge Sacrificium
est Ecclesiae. Tom. 4. lib. 3. cap. 15. Salmeron. E^^usio sanguinis semel facta
semper prodest, modo jugiter offeratut. In Heb. 10. Disp. 19. Becanus. Juge
Sacrificium Veteris Testamenti fuit figura Missae in novo, ratione
determinationis temporis: sicut ille offerebatur mane and vespere, ita Christus
a principio mundi usque ad finem. Apoc. 13. Agnus occisus -- Lib. de Analog.
utriusque Testam. cap. 13. number. 14.
Judge Sacrificium, that is, the Continual Sacrifice; Continually offered:
Whereof the [Iuge] and Continual Sacrifice of the Law was a sign. So you. But
it were strange that the Judge Sacrificium of the Law, continuing both Morning
and Evening, should be a figure of your Masse-Sacrifice, which is but only
offered in the Morning. As if you would make a picture, having two hands, for
to represent a Person that has but one. But, not to deny that the Celebration
of the Eucharist, may be called a Judge Sacrificium (for so some Fathers have
termed it:) Yet, they no otherwise call it Judge, or Continual, than they call
it a Sacrifice, that is, Improperly; because it cannot possibly be compared for
Continuance of Time to that Celestial of Christ in the highest Heaven, where
Christ offers himself to God for us day and night, without Intermission.

Whereupon it is that Irenaeus exhorts men to pray often by Christ at his
Altar, Irenaeus. Nos quoque Victimas offerre ad altar frequenter. Est ergo
Altar in coelis, illuc etiam prec^s nostrae and orationes dirigendae; and
templum -- ut ex Apoc. apertum est. Lib. 4. cap. 34.
Which Altar (says he) is in Heaven, and the Temple open. Apoc. 11. 19. Greg.
Sine intermissione pro nobis Holocaustum Redemptor immolat, qui sine cessatione
Patri suam pro nobis inearnatione^ demonstrat. Moral. lib. 1. cap. 24. in Job.
Where (says Pope Gregory) our Savior Christ offers up his burnt Sacrifices
for us without intermission: And whereupon your Jesuit Coster, out of Ambrose,
affirms, that Coster En^irid. contro. cap. 9. Solut. ad Object. 1. ex Ambros.
Sicut in coelis Christus corpus suum, olim in cruce vulneratum and occisum,
tanquam juge Sacrificium paternis oculis perpetuo pro nobis exhibet: ita hic in
terris per Ministerium Sacerdotum idem Corpus in specie mortui and exanguis
offert. [That is objectively; for it is the Bloody Body, that is presented by
us in the Eucharist.]
Christ exhibiteth his Body wounded upon the Cross, and slain, as a [Iuge
Sacrificium] that is, a Continual Sacrifice, perpetually unto his Father for
us. And to this purpose serve the forecited Testimonies of Augustine, Gregory
Nazianzen, Ambrose, Chrysostom, and Oecumenius; some pointing out the Altar in
Heaven, as the Truth, Some by Exhortations, and Some by their Examples
instructing us to make our Continual Approach unto the Celestial Altar.

CHALLENGE.
NOw you, who so fix the hearts and minds of the Spectators of your Mass, upon
your sublunary Altars and Hoasts, and appropriate the Judge Sacrificium
thereunto (in respect of Time) during only the hours of your Priestly
Sacrificing; allow your attention but a moment of Time, and you will easily see
the Impiety of that your Profession.

The Judge Sacrificium of Christ, as it is presented to God by him in Heaven,
has been described to be Continual, without Intermission, Always (that is)
without any Interruption of any moment of Time: to the end that all sorts of
Penitents and faithful Suitors, soliciting God by him, might find (as the
Apostle says) (...), that is, Help at any time of need. The gates of this
Temple, Heaven, being ever open: the matter of this Sacrifice, which is the
Body of Christ, being there ever present. The Priest, who is Christ himself,
ever executing his Function. Whereas, contrarily, (you will confess, we dare
say) that the Doors of your Churches may happen to be all locked, or
interdicted; your Sacrifice shut up in a Box, or lurched, and carried away by
Mice; your Priest taken up with sport, or repast, or journey, or sleep: yea,
and even when he is acting a Sacrifice, may possibly nullify all his Priestly
Sacrificing Act, by reason of ( See hereafter Book 7. Chap. 5. Sect. 5.
Confessed) Almost infinite Defects.

Therefore the Sacrilegiousnesse of the Doctrine of your Mass is thus far
manifested, in as much that your own Ministerial Priesthood does so
prejudice the personal Priesthood of Christ, as it is in Heaven, as the Moon
does by her interposition eclipse the glory of the Sun: by confounding
things distinct, that is, (as we have learned from the Fathers) Image with
Truth; The state of Wicked Partakers with the Godly; Matters Visible with
Invisible; Signs with Things; Worse with Better; Iayes with Eagles; and the
like.

Of the second Typical Scripture, which is the Passover: showing the
weakness of the Argument taken from thence, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice
in the Mass.

SECT. X.
FIrst it is meet we hear your Objector speak, even your Bellarm. Immolatio
Agni Paschalis potest quidem dici figura Passionis: nam fi Agnus ille fuit
figura Eucharistiae, Eucharistia autem figura Passionis, quis negat Agnum istum
figuram fuisse and Repraesentationem Passionis? Quare Joh. 19. Videmus
Evangelistam reddere cansam, cur non fuerant crura Christi confracta in
Passione, quia scriptum est de Agno Paschali, [Os non comminuetis ex eo.] Tamen
magis immediate and principaliter Ceremonia Agni Paschalis potius fuit figura
Eucharistiae, quam Passionis. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 7.. Illud. -- Quod
celebratio Agni Paschalis fuit figura celebrationis Eucharistiae, probatur ex
Scripturis, 1. Cor. 5. Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus, itaque epulcmur
in azymis Veritatis -- Dicent Adversarii impletum fuisse hoc in Cruce -- At
constat Apostolos in coena manducasse carnem Christi, -- Verum Agnum Paschalem,
ad cujus epulum nos hortatur Apostolus. 1. Cor. 5. Epulemur, etc. Bellarm.
ibid.. Quod igitur, and. Dicent.
Cardinal, who albeit he confesses the Paschall Lamb to have been the figure
of Christ on the Cross, yet did it in the Ceremonies thereof (says he) more
immediately and principally prefigure the Eucharist than the Passion, which is
proved by Scripture, 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passover is offered up, therefore let us
feast it in the Azymes of Sincerity and Truth.] Which offering up was not
fulfilled on the Cross; but it is evident that the Apostle did eat this true
Paschall Lamb, the flesh of Christ, at his Supper: and this Apostle exhorts
us to this Feast, in saying, [Let us therefore keep our feast, etc.] So he,
bestowing a large Chapter of Arguments, wherewith to bleare our eyes, lest that
we should see in this Scripture [Our Passover is offered up] Rather the
Immolation of Christ on the Cross, than in the Eucharist. We willingly yield
unto his alleged Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, who by way of Allusion, or
Analogy, do all call the Eucharist a Paschall Sacrifice. But yet that the
words of this Scripture should more properly and principally mean the
Eucharisticall Sacrifice (as if the Jewish Passover did rather prefigure the
Sacrifice of Christ in the Mass, than on the Cross) not one.

It were a tedious work to sift out all the Dross of his Argumentations;
Nevertheless, because he puts Protestants unto it, saying us follows,
Bellarm. q^ supra. Dicent etc. Dicent Adversarii Apostolum loqui de Immolatione
in cruce facta: at nos probabimus figuram illam proprie impletam fuisse in
c^^na.
But our Adversaries (says he) will say, that the Apostle, in saying our
Passover is offered up, speaks of Christ's Sacrifice offered upon the
Cross, but we will prove that this figure was properly fulfilled at his
S^pper: (So he) We will now show you that other Adversaries, than Protestants,
are ready to encounter this your Champion.

First, the choicest Chieftaine of his own side, armed with the Authority of
Christ himself, Ioh. 13. 1. [Before the day of the Passover, Jesus knowing
that his hour was come, that he must pass out of the world unto the Father.]
Now when was this spoken? Even then, says Job. 13. 1. [Ante diem Paschae
sciens Jesus, quia venit hora, ut transiret ex hoe mundo ad Patrem.] Hic mortem
Transitum vocat. -- Alludit ad Pascha, ac fi Latin diceret, Ante diem festum
Transitus, sciens quia venit hora ut transiret ipse: Ipse enim Pascha nostrum
immolatus est Christus -- Optimus autem terminus, Transitus ejus ex hoc mundo
ad Patrem. Tolet. Ies. Com. in ^um locum.
Tolet, your Cardinal and Jesuit, When he came to the celebrating of the
Sacrament of his Body and Blood, that is, at his last Supper. But what was
meant hereby? namely, Christ alluded unto the Jewish Passover (says he) in
signification of his own passing over by death to his Father. So he. So also
your Jesuit August. in Psalm. 68. Cum venit Dominus ad Sacramentum sanguinis and
corporis sui, ita loquitur, [Sciens quod ho^a venit, ut transiret ad Patrem de
mundo.] Quibus verbis expressit transitum Paschae Test Pererio Ies. in Exodus
cap. 12. Disp. 8.
Pererius, out of Augustine.

A second Scripture is the objected Text 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passover is offered
up, Christ:] that is, As the figurative paschall Lamb was offered up for the
deliverance of the people of Israel out of Egypt, so Christ was offered up to
death for the Redemption of his people, and so passed by his passion to his
Father. So your 1. Cor. 5. Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus, ergo Epulemur
Azymis sinceritatis, and veritatis. [Aquinas assign^t Rationem, quare fideles
debent esse Azym^: quae quidem Ratio sumitut ex my^ Passionis] -- Sicut Agnus
figuralis immolatus est a fil^s Israel. ut populus liberaretur -- it a Christus
occisus ab Israelitis, ut populus liberaretur a servitute Diaboli. Christus
enim per passionem trans^t ex mundo ad Patrem. Joh. 13. Haec Aquin. Com. in 1.
Cor. 5. And Tollet in his Testimony before cited. So Becanus Ies.
Aquinas. [Our Passover.] Namely, by his Sacrifice in shedding his Blood on
the Cross. So your Jesuit [Pascha nostrum. 1. Cor. 5] Nempe per immolationem
in cruce, and effusionem sanguinis illius, liberatum est genus huma^um. Analog.
utrius^u^ Testam. cap. 13. page 313.
Becanus. And, By this his Passover on the Cross was the Passover of the
Jews fulfilled. So your Bishop Impleta erat figura Paschalis, quando ^erum
nostrum Pascha est immolatus Christus Jesus, and nos per ejus sanguinem
liberati eramur. Iansen. Concord. (...)vang. c^p. 131. page 895
Iansenius, as flat diameter to your Cardinal's Objection as can be.

A third Scripture we find, Ioh. 19. [They broke not his legs, that the
Scriptures might be fulfilled which is written, A bone of him shall not be
broken:] which your Joh. 19 [Cruta non confregerant, ut imple^e^ur quod
scriptum est, Osnon comminuetis ex eo.] Bellarm. q^ sup. yet gaine-saith with
his. Tamen etc.. Illud.
Cardinal himself confesses to relate only to Christ's Sacrifice on the
Cross; and notwithstanding dare immediately oppose, saying, Nevertheless the
Ceremony of the Paschall Lamb did more immediately and properly prefigure the
Eucharist than Christ's passion: wherein, whether he will or no, he must be an
Adversary to himself. For there is no Ceremony more principal in any
Sacrifice than are these two, viz. The matter of Sacrifice, and the Sacrificing
Act thereof. Now the matter of the Sacrifice was a Lamb, the Sacrificing Act
was the killing thereof, and offering it up killed unto God. Whether therefore
the Paschall Lamb did more principally prefigure the visible Body of Christ on
the Cross, or your imagined Invisible in your Mass, whether the slain
Paschall Lamb bleeding to death, did more properly and immediately prefigure
and represent a living and perfect Body of Christ, than that his Body wounded
to death, and bloodshed, Common sense may stand for Judge.

The Ancient Fathers, when they speak of the Sacrifice of Christ's Passion, in
a precise propriety of speech, do declare themselves accordingly. If in
general, then as Origin. Sacrificium, pro quo haec omnia Sacrificia in typo
and figura praecesserunt, unum and perfectum immolatus est C^ristus. Hujus
Sacrificii carnem quisquis tetigerit, sanctificabitur. In Levit. cap. 6. Hom. 4.
Origin: All those other Sacrifices (says he) were prefigurations of this our
perfect Sacrifice. If more particularly, then as Chrysost^mus de Cruce and
Latrone. 1. Cor. 5. Pascha nostru^ immolatus est Christus: ^estivitas ergo etc.
Vides crucis ^ntuitu perceptam laetitiam? in cruce enim immolatus est Christus:
Ubi immolatio, amputatio peccatorum; ubi amputatio peccatorum, reconciliatio
Domini -- novu^ Sacrificium -- nam ipse Sacrificium erat, and Sacerdos;
Sacrificiu^ secundum carnem, Sacerdos secundum Spiritu^, offerebat secundum
Spiritu^* offerebatur secundum carnem -- and altar Crux fuit. Chrys^st. T^^.
3. page 826.
Chrysostom, from the objected Text of the Apostle. 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passover
is offered up, Christ, Let us therefore keep our feast, etc.] Do thou see
(says he) in beholding the Cross, the joy which we have from it? for Christ
is offered upon the Cross, and where there is an Immolation, there is
Reconciliation with God: this was a new Sacrifice, for in this the flesh of
Christ was the thing sacrificed, his Spirit the Priest and Sacrificer, and the
Cross his Altar. In so much that, elsewhere he teaches every Christian how,
as a spiritual Priest, he may (...). Idem. Tom. 5. Sermon. 88. Edit. Savil. page
602.
Always keep the Passover of Christ. What greater plainness can be
desired? and yet behold, if it be possible, a greater from Sacrates Hist. lib.
5. cap. 22. Origenes Doctor valde sapiens cum animadverteret Legis Mosaicae
praecepta ad literam non posse intelligi, praeceptum de Paschate ad divinam
contemplationem traduxit: (...).
Origin, calling the Sacrifice on the Cross the the Only true Passover.
Which saying his Reporter Socrates imbraceth, as a Divine Contemplation. From
Typical Scriptures we descend to Prophetical.

CHAP. IV.
That the objected Prophetical Scriptures of the old Testament are by your
Disputers violently wrested, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice in the Mass.

The first Text is Malachy chap. 5. verse. 1.

THE Texts are two. The first, which is, Mal. 5. 1. is objected by your
Cardinal in this manner: [From the rising of the Sun to the going down of
the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place shall
Sacrifice, and Oblation be offered to my name.] This, says your Cardinal, See
the Testimony following.
Is a notable Testimony for the Sacrifice of the Mass.

The State of the Question.

BE so good, as to set down the State of the Controversy your selves, Insigne
testimonium pro Sacrificio Missae, Mal. 5. 1. in his verbis [Ab ortu solis
usque ad occasum magnum est nomen meum in Gentibus, and in omni loco
sacrificatur and offertur nomini meo Oblatio munda: quia magnum est nomen meum
in Gentibus, dicit Dominus. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. Tota controversia est,
An Malachias loquatur de Sacrificio proprie dicto, quale est in Ecclesia
Eucharistia, an vero de Sacrificio improprie dicto, quales sint lauds and
Orationes, etc. Bellarm. Ibid. Argum. 1. Propheta utitur voce Minhhah, quod est
Sacrificium absolute, absque adjuncto, ut cum dicitur, Sacrificium laudis, etc.
Argum. 2. Vox [Munda] opponitur immundis oblationibus Judaeornm, quae non
dicuntur immundae ex part offerentium tantum, quia opponit illis oblationem:
non enim Munda diceretur in omni loco, cum in pluribus sint mali Ministri.
Argum. 3. Dicitur, [Non accipiam munus a manibus vestris.] Hinc colligimus, non
solum mundam esse hanc nostram, sed and novam. -- Argum. 4. Ex Antithesi.
Contemptus Hebraeorum erat in publicis Sacrificiis, non in privato cultu
tantum. Ergo gloria Oblationum apud Christianos erit in publico Sacrificio.
Argum. 5. Opponit Malachias non omni populo, sed Sacerdotibus tantum veteris
Legis, non omnes Christianos, sed certos homines, qu^ Sacerdotibas succedunt.
Ergo non loquitur de spirituali, sed de Sacrificio proprie dicto.
The whole Controversy is, whether this Scripture spoke of a Sacrifice
properly so called, or of an Improper Sacrifice, such as are Prayers and
Thanksgiving, etc. So you. You contend for a Proper Sacrifice, and We deny it:
and how that we are to grapple together, we shall first charge you with
alleging a corrupt Tr^nslation, as the ground of your false Interpretation.

That the Romish Objection is grounded upon a false Text, which is in your
Romish Vulgar Translation; even by the judgment of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. I.
YOur Romish Vulgar Translation (which was decreed in the Council of Trent to
be the only Authentical, and which thereupon you are enjoined to use in all
your Disputations; and not this only, but bound also thereunto by an Oath in
the Bull of Pius Quartus, not to transgress that Decree) does deliver us this
Text [In every place is sacrificed and offered to my name a pure Oblation,
etc.] without any mention of the word Incense at all: whereas (which your
Cardinal Bellarm. In Hebraea, and Graeca Editione sic leg^mus [Incensum
offertur nomini meo, and Sacrificium mundum.] Quo supra.
confesses) Both the Hebrew and Greek Text has it thus: [Incense is offered
in my name; and a pure offering, etc.] and that More plainly, says your
Septuaginta Apertius. Valent. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 4. p. 526.
Valentia. Which warranteth us to call your Vulgar Translation false, as we
shall now prove, and you perceive, without any far Digression. For we meddle
not now with the general Controversy, about this Translation, but insist only
upon this Particular, that as A Lion is known by his claw, so your vulgar
Translation may be discerned by this one Clause, wherein the word, Incense, is
omitted quite.

If ye will permit us, without being prejudicated by your Fathers of Trent, to
try the Cause by impartial Judges, which are the ancient Fathers of Primitive
Times; especially now, when you your selves are so urgent in pressing us with
multitudes of their Testimonies, for Defense of your Romish Sacrifice, even in
their Expositions of this Text of Malachy: Look then upon the Bellarm. Vocem

Marginals, and you shall find mention of the word Incense (according to the
Hebrew and Greek Texts) in the very same objected Testimonies of Tertullian,
Irenaeus, Hierom, Chrysostom, Eusebius, and Augustine. Notwithstanding, we
should not be so vehement, in condemning your Romish Translation in this point,
if the matter, now in hand, did not challenge us thereunto: the word, Incense,
being sufficient in it self to satisfy all your Objections taken from the
Sentences of Fathers, and urged by virtue of the word, Sacrifice, and Oblation,
as will appear.

That the Text of Malachy does not imply a proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist,
by the Expositions of ancient Fathers.

SECT. II.
TWo words we find in this Prophet, concerning the new Testament: One is,
Incense, in the Text now alleged; the other is the word, Levites. The first in
Chap. 1. verse. 3. [In every place there shall be an Offering of Incense, and a
Sacrifice, etc.] You All affirm of Prayers, Praises, and holy Actions, that
they are Spiritual, and no proper Sacrifices. But the Fathers, by you
objected, (to wit, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Hierome, Chrysostom, Eusebius, and
Augustine) do See the preceding Marginalls.
Expound Incense to signify these Spiritual Duties, which are unproperly
called Incense. Therefore may we as justly conceive, that the word, Sacrifice,
used by them, and applied to the service of God in the new Testament, was meant
Improperly; and that so much the rather, because your Cardinal has no
Objection out of the Fathers for his advantage in the word, Sacrifice, which he
loses not by the word Incense, from point to point.

For the first Objection we oppose, saying, The word Incense, is likewise used
without See in the Testimonies above cited, for it is called absolutely
Incense, and not Incense of Prayer, etc.
Addition. To the second, We accordingly say, Incense was meant also to be
Pure: for you will not imagine, that God would promise to his faithful in
Christ Impure things. To the third; It is as well said concerning Incense, as
of Sacrifice (against the Jews, verse. 10.) I will not receive any offerings at
your hands: Isaiah 1. 13.
Incense is an abominination unto me. To the fourth, The same Godless Jews
did jointly contemn Gods worship made by Incense, as by Sacrifice; except you
shall think it credible, that the same men should be both devout and profane
in one prescribed Service of God. To the last, Malachy in the same sentence
(and as it were with the same breath) equally takes exceptions to the Jewish
Priests, in both Sacrifice, and Incense. Therefore as the word, Incense, so
accordingly the word, Sacrifice, was used improperly of the Fathers. Do you
not now see what reason your Cardinal had, to make choice of a corrupt Text,
wanting the word Incense? which he peradventure foresaw would prove as bitter
as Coloquintida in his Pottage.

The second word in Malachy is [Levite,] I will purge the sons of Levi; which
was spoken (as your Cardinal Bellar. Postquam dixerat Malachias [offertur
nomini meo oblatio munda] Exponit cap. 3. a quibus offerenda sit munda oblatio:
Purgabit, inquit, filios Levi: Vbi, per Filios Levi, non possunt intelligi
Levit^ veteris Testamenti -- sed nostri Sacerdotes. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10..
Quintum.
confesses) of the Ministers of the new Testament. Well then, did the Prophet
call the Ministry and service of the new Testament, Pure Sacrifice? And did he
not in the like manner call the Ministers of the new Testament Purged Levites?
as also some of the Ancient Augustine, Ambrose, Cyprian, Leo.
Fathers (you know) used to do: And as your Church, in degrading of
Archbishop Cranmer from his order of M. Fox Act. Monument. page 2117.
Levitico ordine te privamus.
Deaconship once did. Therefore both alike were used Improperly, in imitation
of this Prophet, and also of that in Isa. 66.
Isaiah, I will send them Priests and Levites.

That the Text of the Prophet Malachy does confute the Romish Pretense of
Sacrifice, even by the objected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. III.
PErmit you us, for brevity sake, to contrive this Section into Ob. and Sol.
your Cardinal's Objections, and our Solutions or Answers. 1. Ob. Sacrifice is
called pure, Ergo, Christ's Body. Sol. And Chrysostom. (who is Chrysostom. in Psalm.
95. (objected) Malachias appellat Thymiama purum, sacras preces.
objected) terms Prayers, Pure Incense. 2. Ob. The word, Sacrifice,
signifies not Prayers, Praises, or Pious Actions, for these are improperly
called Sacrifices, Ergo, etc. Sol. First, Tertull. ob. by Bellarm. lib. 3.
cont. Marcion. ex Psalm. 57. In Ecclesiis benedicite Dominum Deum, ut pariter
concurreret Malachiae prophetia, In omni loco Sacrificium mundum: Gloriae sc.
relatio, and Benedictio, and Laus, and Hymni. [Which words Bellarmine
restrains to Prayers and Praises only, in the Mass; whereas Tertullian
speaks of Prayers in general.] Again, Lib. 4. advers. Marc. a little after
the begiuning. Dicente Malachia, Sacrificium mundu^, s^-simplex oration de
conscientia pura. [Where he expounds Pure Sacrifice to be Prayer.]
Tertullian (objected) expounded the word Sacrifice, to signify Benedictions,
and Praises. And secondly, Eusebius. Demonst. lib. 1. cap. 6. In omni loco
Incensum and Sacrificium, etc.] Quid aliud significat quam orationis Incensum,
and Sacrificium, quod [mundum] dicitur? est enim non per cruores, sed per pias
actiones summo Deo offerendum.
Eusebius (objected) calls this Pure Sacrifice, Pious Actions and Prayers.
Which your Cardinal could not Answer, but with a mavelous and miserable
Illusion. 3. Ob. By the word, Bellarm. Resp. Non quasi Oration sit ipsum
Incensum, seu Sacrificium, sed illud quod per Orarationem, i. e. per verba
Consecrationis perficitur. Solent enim Patres verba Consecrationis orationes,
sen mysticas preces interpretari. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. [First sondly, for
the words of Consecration contain in them no term of Prayer: And secondly
falsely, for the Fathers did not call these words Prayer. Both which have been
amply discussed.]
Sacrifice, were not meant Spiritual Sacrifices, etc. Sol. Yet Hieron.
(objected) Mal. 1. Vt sciant Judaei carnalibus Victimis spirituales
successuras. Thymiama, hoc est, Orationes Sanctorum offerendas, Oblationem
mundam, ut est in Ceremoniis Christianoru^. Bellar. Licet per Incensum
intelligat Orationem, tamen per Sacrificium intelligit Eucharistiam: dicit enim
offerri in Ceremoniis Christianorum. [Be it so, but the Question is, whether
the Action of the Eucharist be not called spiritual, that is (as is confessed)
an Improper Sacrifice.
Hierome (objected) expressly names the Sacrifice, in Malachy, Spiritual.

To come to your Cardinals principal Reason. 4. Ob. The Jewish Sacrifices were
called Unclean, not in respect of the Offerers, but of the Offerings;
intimating thereby, that this Offering in the new Testament can be no less
than the very Body of Christ. Sol. Irenaeus (objected) plainly puts the
difference to be made, by Malachy, between the Sacrifices, as they were the
Offerings of the wicked Jews, and the Sacrifices of godly Christians; and he
gives this Reason, because Irenaeus (^b.) advers. Haeres. lib. 4. cap. 34.
speaking as well of Sacrifices in Judaico populo, as in Ecclesia, says; Non
Sacrificia sanctificant homine^, sed Conscientia pu^a ejus, qui offert etc.
Then of Eleemosynae, which the Apostle calls Hostiam acceptabilem: Oportet
nos oblationem Deo facere in sententia pura. And then, Ecclesia offert
oblatione^ hanc Fabricatori puram, offerens ei cum gratiarum Action ex
creatura ejus. Judaei autem non offerunt, quia manus eorum plenae sanguine etc.
The Jews (says he) offered up their Oblations with wicked hearts, but the
Christians perform theirs with pure Consciences. And that the Jewish
Sacrifices were not rejected for themselves, but for the impiety of their
Sacrificers; your own Jesuit Ribcra Ies. Ad loca Scripturae adducta respondere
Apostoli. Apud S. Clementem lib. 6. Constable. Apost. C. 22. in hunc modu^.
Recusabat Deus populi Sacrificia saepenumero in eum peccantis, atque
existimantis Sacrificiis eum, and non poenitentia placatum iri. Idem docet
Irenaeus, lib. 4. cap. 33. In Hos. 6. number. 24.
Ribera confirms both by the Constitutions of Pope Clement, and also by this
Testimony of Irenaeus. A Truth so evident to your Divines of Collen, that they
presume Antididag. Colon. Tract. de Sacrif. Missae,. De Consecratione. Quis
ignorant vetera Patrum Sacrificia, quae Christum figurabant, vel ob id quod Deus
ea praecepisset, per se munda fuisse? Nihilominus tamen frequentius immunda
vocantur in Scripturis, non ratione sui, sed propter malam voluntatem
offerentium.
None to be ignorant; for that the Sacrifices of the old Testament were all
clean and pure, because God has ordained them, and they became impure by the
wicked hearts of the Offerers. And Tertullian gives the same Observation for
the Reason, why God, in rejecting them, said, Tertull. lib. 3. advers.
Marcionem. Sacrificia rejecta, qui a non secundum Dei religionem celebranda,
sua jam, non Dei fecerant. page 160. And, Sacrificia spiritualia accepta, which
he names above, Cor contribulatum, laudem, etc. Lib. adversus Iudaeos.
I will no more of your Sacrifice, and not of my Sacrifice.

But you will say, Some of the Fathers spoke directly of the Proper Sacrifice
of the new Testament. We answer, that as they apply it to the Eucharist, they
meant no proper Sacrifice, as the Subject, but only as the Object therein,
which was that of the Cross. In which respect Chrysostom. (objected) in Psalm.
95. Ex hostia prima mensa mystica coeleste Sacrificium, summeque venerandum.
Est autem in nobis varia differentia: Lex multas habet Hostias, Gratia nova
unam -- Vis scire Victimas, quas Ecclesia habet? -- quando fit Sacrificium
mundum and immaculatum? audi Scripturam Tibi palam exponentem hanc
differentiam. Et Sacrificium, quod antea dixi spirituale, illud mysticum donum,
in qo Apostolus Ephesians. 5. Christus tradidit se ipsum pro Nobis Deo Sacrificium.
Chrysostom (objected) calls it that Sacrifice, whereof Saint Paul writes,
saying, [Christ gave himself up a Sacrifice for his Church.] Ephesians. 5. Lastly,
Cyprian (objected) calls it the Cypr. (ob.) ex lib. 1. cont. Iudaos, cap. 16.
Novum Sacrificium, Sacrificium Laudis.
New Sacrifice of Praise: which is, you know, a Spiritual, and no Corporal or
Proper Sacrifice. The first Prophetical Text is finished.

The second Prophetical Text (as is pretended) is Psalm. 72. 16. concerning an
[Handfull of Corn in the Top of the Mountains:] objected to prove a Sacrifice
in the Romish Mass; but yet as very Romishly, as were the rest.

SECT. IV.
OF this Corn your Psalm. 72. juxta Heb. [Et erit pugillus frumenti in
summitatibus montium] vulg. Lat. [Et erit firmamentum in terra in summis
Montium.] Galatinus de Arcanis Cath. Veritat^, lib. 10. cap. 5. Hoc est, dicit
Chaldaea Translatio Rabbi Jonathae, Et e^t Sacrificium panis in summis montium
-- Cum ergo ait, Erit placenta frumenti in terra, in capite montium, vult
dicere, quod placenta panis fiet Sacrificium in Capitibus Sacerdoru^, qui sunt
Ecclesia. Haec ibi -- Nec mirum de sapientibus antiquis Judaeorum Messiam
placentam trumenti, and frustum panis iuturum dixisse. The same has Coccius
Thesaur. Cath. lib. 6. Art. 4. page 679. He adds other Authors, (...) wit,
P. Galatinus, Claud. Sanctesius, and Genebrard. in hunc Psalm. Coc^i^s* ibid.
Art. 16. page 763.
Disputers Coccius, Duraeus, Sanctesius, Genebrard, out of Galatinus, and He
out of the Chaldee Translation, and other his supposed Jewish Rabbis, have
observed a Cake on the top of the Mountains. But what of this? This Cake,
forsooth, was by their Doctrine a Prophetical prediction of the Romish
Wafer-Cake, which is heaved up over the head of the Priest for, a Sacrifice.
And this is called, by Master Breerly, M. B^eerly in his Protestants Apol.
noting Duraeus the Jesuit to have urged the same out of Galatini^.
A most strong Argument, in behalf of the said Doctrine. But we must tell
you, that your Galatinus is too credulous, and that his Rabbinicall Abstracts
are no better than the Gibeonites old torn shoes, and mooldy bread, seeming
to have come from far, even from old Rabbis, when as they were invented and
brought from their latter Rabbis and Glozers, as it were from the next
bordering Countries: because your Author Galatinus (who produces the foresaid
Rabbinish prediction of that Cake) is branded, for such like his Conceits,
with the mark of a Vain man, by your judicious Senensis Biblioth. lib. 2..
Traditiones. Non possum satis mirari studium Petri Galatini, qui -- in eam
Vanitatem devenit, ut doceret opera Thalmudica in Latinum verti oporrere, and
public in Scholis Christianorum explicari.
Senensis. And the Chaldee Paraphrase, which talks of your Sacrificed Cake,
is rejected, as being a corrupt Puddle of Jewish Fables, (and fabulous in this
very point) by your great Roman Dictator Bellarm. in Psalm. 71. verse. 16* Scio
quod Paulus Burgensis ex Paraphrasi Chaldaica adferat ad probandum hoc in loco
Sacrificium Missae: sed scio etiam quam multis fabulis Judaicis Pharaphrasis
illa scateat, ideo piget ex lacunis Expositionum Judaicarum hau^, etc.
Bellarmine.

Which we speak not, as being offended to hear any Rabbi calling that, which
is in the hand of your Priest, and above his head, A Cake, which in your Romish
Phrase is called a Wafer-cake: for if it be indeed and truly a Cake, then is
not it Accidents only, but has still in it the substance of Bread. And so
farewell your Helena of Trent, called Transubstantiation. Now because the
Sacrifice can be no better than the matter thereof will permit it, it follows
that the Sacrifice is not properly the Body of Christ, but the Element of
Bread. And thus your Authors (after their laborious kneading and moulding,
their greedy longing, and their sweetly chewing hereof) are at length in a
manner choked with their own Cake.

CHAP. V.
Of our Second Examination of this Controversy, by the Judgment of Ancient
Fathers, showing that they never called the Eucharist a Sacrifice properly.

Our general Proposition.

The ancient Fathers never called the Eucharist properly a Sacrifice: proved by
many Demonstraations.

THE Demonstrations, which we are to speak of, are many; some taken from the
proper, and some from the pretended Subject of the Eucharist; some from the
paritie of like speeches of Fathers, as well in other Sacraments, Acts, and
Adjuncts, as in these which are belonging to the Eucharist.

The first Demonstration is, That the Fathers called Bread and Wine a
Sacrifice; as being the Subject matter of the Eucharist, but Improperly.

SECT. I.
THat Ancient Fathers called Bread and Wine a Sacrifice, even before
Consecration, we have it confessed asseverantly by your own Maldon^^. Ob.
Iren^um lib. 4. cap. 32, and 34. Scribit Christianos Deo offerre pri^itias
creaturatum panem and vinum -- Dicebatur etiam sacrificare homo profanus, qui
Sacerdoti tradebat victimam, ut eam pro se sacrificaret: non quod illa traditio
esset Sacrificium. Ita ^ocuti sunt etiam Christiani antiqui, ut constat ex
verbis Cypriani in Sermon. de Eleemof. Locuples matrona fine Sacrificio in
Dominicum veniens. Nec necesse est (ut Irenaeus ^oquitur) de proprio
Sacrificio, quia nefas est credere Ecclesiam obtuli^^e rem ullam corpoream and
^errestrem Deo post abrogata omnia hujus^d, Sacrificia terrena. Maldonat. loco
ci^at^. Accipiendo Sacrificium pro re, quae sacrificatur, negati non debet,
panem and vinum aliquo modo in Missa offerri, and pr^inde pertmere ad rem
praesentem: na^ cum ante Consecrationem dicimus [Suscipe, Sancte Pater, hanc
tuam immacula^am Hostiam] certe pronomen, Hanc, demonstrat ad sensum id quod
tunc manibus tenemus, id autem panis est. Et similes sunt in Liturgia non
paucae sententiae, quae panem offerri aperte sane demonstrant. Denique veteres
Patres passim idem tradunt, Iren. lib. 4. cap 32. dicit Ecclesiam offerre
Sacrific^^m ex creaturi^. Et Cypr. lib. 2. Ep. 3. Christum obtulisse Calicem
vino and aqua mixtam. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27.. Re^pondeo ut.
Jesuit, where he will have you furthermore to observe, that Bread and Wine,
before Consecration, is called an Immaculate Sacrifice, even in your Roman
Mass. And that the Primitive Fathers called Bread and Wine, Sacrifice, after
Consecration also, we have likewise proved in two full See above Chap. 3. Sect.
2.
Sections: which your Cardinal is bound to acknowledge, who, to prove that
Melchizedech Sacrificed Bread and Wine, produced the Testimonies of Ambrose,
Augustine, Chrysostom, Oecumenius, and Theophylact, to conclude them to have
been Figures of the Eucharist, which we desire you to carry still in mind,
until we end this Section.

Hereupon we demand, whether you think that Bread and Wine, in the Eucharist,
can be called of Christians a Sacrifice properly, either before, or after
Consecration? No (says one Valent. Ies. obj cienti Melchizedechum o^tuli^^e
panem and vinum ca^um. Resp. Sacerdotium Christi secundum ordinem Melchizedech
-- Etiam ratione rei oblatae, non quatenus oblatione illius substantiae
determinatae, sepanis and vini exercebatur. Lib. 1. de Miss, cap. 4.
Jesuit) Because it is not agreeable to our Priesthood. No (says a Bellarm.
respondens quaestioni. An cum solus Panis muta^ur, si proprie sacrificaretur?
Inquit, Id absurdissimum esset: tum haberet Ecclesia Sacrificium inanimum, and
vilius multo quam habuerint olim Hebraei. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27.. Sed haec.
Second) because it were most absurd that the Church of Christ should have a
lifelesse Sacrifice, and consequently more vile than was the Jewish. No, (
Nefas est, credere Ecclesiam obtulisse rem ullam corpoream and terrestrem Deo
post abrogata omnia hujusmodi Sacrificia terrena. Maldon. lib. de 7. Sacram.
Tom. 1. de Euch. part. 3.. Primum Argumentum.
says a Third) because it were an heinous impiety now, after the abrogation of
the terrene Sacrifices of the Jews, to believe that the Church of God should
profess an Offering of Corporal and earthly Sacrifices. No ( Salmeron.
Communis sensus est omnium Christianorum, non esse aliud Sacrificium quam
Corpus and Sanguinem Christi -- At si panis esset Sacrificium, sequeretur, quod
res inanimata sacrificare^tur -- -- Et quod summa Latria esset circa panem and
vinum. Tom. 9. Tract. 29.. Quinta.
says a Fourth) for it is the judgment of all Christians, that there is no
Sacrifice in Christian Religion, but the Body and Blood of Christ: because
otherwise the Act of Sacrificing thereof, being a Divine Worship, should be
exercized upon Bread and Wine. So they. We would be glad to take the Apostle
of Christ to be our Guide, for our better security, he (as is likewise Bellarm.
Apostolus declarat, non esse terrenu aliquid quod offert Christus, si esset
super terrain, ex Heb. (...). 4. Etostendit nunc mellores hostias offerri. Lib.
1. de Missa, cap. 6.. Resp. quid.
confessed) teaches, that God now is not to be worshipped, by way of
Sacrifice, with any outward thing.

Oh that your Divines would exercise their quils in publishing such sound
Truths as this is, we then would wish them Good speed in all their Writings.
Notwithstanding, upon consideration of the Premises, we are enforced to
complain of the Inconsionableness of your Cardinal, who, to prove a proper
Sacrifice in the Eucharist, did (as you may remember) produce the Testimonies
of five Fathers, wherein that, which they called a Sacrifice, they expressed to
be Bread and Wine; which by the joint and consonant Confession of the Cardinal
himself, and other prime Jesuits of his own society, cannot be held to be
proper Sacrifices without Absurdity and Impiety. And the like obliquity of
Judgment you may find in your Romish Divines, in alleging the Testimonies of
Irenaeus, for proof of the Sacrifice of your Mass, which your Jesuit Maldonat
has truly observed to have been spoken of Bread and Wine, even Rhemists
Annot. in Luc. 22. 19.
before Consecration.

One word more. By this you may perceive another proof of the Idiome of
Ancient Fathers, in Extending the word [Sacrifice] beyond it is literal sense:
which (beside the former) the last annexed Testimony of To these former, we
add another objected Testimony of Augustine. Lib. de fide ad Pet. Diac. cap.
19. Nullatenus dubites unigenitum Dei filium obtulisse hostiam Deo pro nobis,
cui nunc cum Patre and Spiritu Sanct^ offerimus Sacrificium panis and vini, in
fide and charitate, in Catholica Ecclesia per universum mundum.
Augustine confirms, showing, that now there is in this our Sacrifice no
other Subject but Bread and Wine. This may serve for the present, concerning
the true and proper Subject of the Eucharist, Bread and Wine. We in the next
place are to examine the pretended Subject, which your Church will have to be
the Body and Blood of Christ. (*) See above at (a).


Our Second Demonstration is, that the Ancient Fathers held not the Body and
Blood of Christ to be the proper Subject matter of the Eucharist, in calling it
a Sacrifice.

SECT. II.
HOw comes the Body and Blood of Christ to be a Proper Sacrifice in the
Eucharist? Your Cardinal will tell us, to wit, Bread and Wine are consecrated,
and by Consecration made the Body and Blood of Christ: so that now Bellarm.
lib. 1. de Missa, (...). 27.. His igitur. -- In Missa Sacrificio requiritur ut
res prophana sit sacra: sic hic, ubi panis convertitur in corpus Christi --.
Respondeo, etc. Non panis sed quod ^x pane factum proprie sacri^^catur. [For
still the Question is that of Lomba^ds; Quae^^tur si quod gerit Sacerdos, sit
proprie Sacrificiu^. Lib. 4. Did. 12. li^. G.]
Not Bread (says he) but the Body of Christ is the Thing sacrificed. This is
plain dealing, and as much as if he had said, If there be in the Eucharist no
Transubstantiation of the Bread into Christ's Body, by Consecration, then
cannot Christ's Body be a proper Sacrifice. But that there is no such
Transubstantiation or Corporal Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament,
has been proved to be the Judgment of Ancient Fathers, by many
Demonstrations thorow-out the third and fourth Books. A stronger Argument
there needs not.

Our Third Demonstration is, because the objected places of Antiquity, for
proof of a Representative Sacrifice, properly so called, do not point out any
where the Body of Christ as the proper Subject, but only as the Object of the
Sacrifice spoken of.

SECT. III.
The necessary use of this Distinction.

Our Distinction is this. These words, The Body and Blood of Christ, as they
are applied to the Eucharist, in the name of Sacrifice, may admit of a double
Acception; one is to take them subjectively, as being the proper Material
Subject of this Sacrament, the other is to understand them objectively: that
is, to account the Body and Blood of Christ, as they were the Sacrifice of
Christ upon the Cross, to be only the proper Object of a Christian
Celebration, according to the Direction and Institution of Christ, saying, Do
this in remembrance of me. Your Romish Church professes the Body and Blood to
be the proper Subject; we nay, but the proper Object of our Celebration. This
Distinction, well learned, will be unto our Reader as an Ariadne's thread, to
wind him out of the Labyrinth of all Obscurities, and seeming Repugnancies of
Ancient Fathers; out of all the confused Subtilties and equivocall Resolutions
of your Romish Disputers; and out of the Perplexities wherewith some
Protestants also may seem (in some sort) to have been entangled.

The Demonstration it self is, Because the Eucharist, being only Commemorative
and Representative, cannot be a proper Sacrifice: answering the Romish
Objection taken from the Sacrifices under the Law.

SECT. IV.
THat it cannot be called properly a Sacrifice, which is only for
Commemoration and Representation, is the Conclusion of your own Bellar. Si
sola repraesentatio Sacrificii crucis, tum non potest di^i oblatio in hunc
modum: Offero tibi Pater, etc. ac a Patribus oblatio dicitur. Lib. 1. de Missa,
cap. 15. Quarto.
Cardinal; although it cannot be denied, but that Improperly it may be called,
as well as you may call the Image of Christ crucified, the Crucifix. But, to
come to your Objection, your Rhemists Annotat. in L^c. 22. and Bellar. Finis
^rat Sacrificiorum praecedentium reptae^entare Sacrificium Crucis, ut futurum,
Et ficut veter^ Sacrificia non amit^ebant verans and propriam rationem
Sacrificii, ex co quod essent representativa^ ita nec Sacrificium Eucharistiae
amittit propriam Sacrificii rationem, propter Commemoratione^. Lib. 1. de
Missa, cap. 12.. Quod vero.
Romish Divines and Romish Cardinal are very earnest and instant in proving
that because the Jewish Sacrifices, being Representations of the passion of
Christ, were notwithstanding true and proper Sacrifices: Therefore the being
Representative, can be no hindrance that the Eucharist should be a proper
Sacrifice. So they. But yet so, as if they had meant to say nothing to the
purpose, because the Jewish Sacrifices, albeit they were Representations of
Christ's Passion, yet were they not only Representations thereof, as the
Eucharist is, but were also beside that Sacrifices in themselves, and so
ordained to be by God; first in their matter, as Bulls, Sheep, Goats; next in
their Sacrificing Act, which was destructive, as to be slain; and lastly, in
their proper and peculiar end, which was (as your Bellarm. Sacrificia illa
Levitica non culpam and poenam aeternam, sed immunditiem legalem, and poenam
temporalem explabant. -- Patet ex Dei promissione de remissione peccatorum; ex
mensura Sacrificii majori^ and minoris pro majore and minore delicto. Levit. 6.
and 4, and 5. At pro peccatis gravioribus, ut blasphemia, homicidio, etc. nulla
videmus instituta Sacrificia. Lib. 4. de Poenitent. cap. 15.. Respondeo. and.
Ex his. Non quoad culpam and poenam Gehennae, nisi quatenus figna erant
protestantia fidem in Christuum, ut docent communiter Theologi. Idem lib. 2. de
effect. Sacram. cap. 17. Et omnia illa erant Sacrifieia vera, and signa^ula
promissionis Christ^ venturi and morituri. Idem lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 24.
Cardinal witnesses) for expiation of legal Pollutions, and remission of
temporal punishments. Each one of these may satisfy your Objection.

The Confirmation of the former Demonstration out of the Fathers first
Explaining of themselves.

SECT. V.
SAint Ambrose setting forth two kind of Offerings of Christ, here on earth,
and above in Heaven, he says that Ambros. Vmbra in Lege, imago in Evangelio,
veritas in coelestibus: ante agnas offerebatur* nunc Christus offertur quasi
Homo, quasi recipiens passionem, and offert sese ipse quasi Sacerdos, ut
peccata nostra dimittat, hic in imagine, ibi in veritate, ubi apud Pattem pro
nobis quasi Advocatu^ intervenit. Lib. 1. de offic. cap. 48.
Christ here is offered as one suffering, and above he himself Offers
himself an Advocate with the Father for us. And this our offering of him he
calls but an Image; and that above he calls the Truth. Clearly showing,
that we have in our Offering Christ's Body only, as it is Crucified, which is
the Object of our Commemoration; But the same Body, as it is now the personal
subject of a present Time, and Place, they behold it in Heaven; even the same
Body, which was once offered on the Cross by his Passion, now offered up by
himself to God, by Presentation in Heaven; here in the Church only by our
Representation Sacramentally on earth.

Saint Augustine deals as plainly with us, where distinguishing three States
of Offerings up to Christ, he August. H^jus Sacrific^ caro and sanguis ante
adventum Christi per victimas similitudinum promittebatur; in passione Domini
per ipsam Veritatem: post Ascensum per Sacramentum memoriae celebratur. Con.
Fau^^. lib. 20. cap. 21. Tom 6. Nonne semel immolatus est Christus, and tamen
in Sacramento quot: die immolatur? He adds, Nec tamen mentitur, qui dicit
Christum immolari: si enim Sacramenta non haberent similitudinem rerum ipsarum,
quas repraesentant, non essent Sacramenta. Ex qua similitudine nomina little
accipiunt. Aug. lib. Epist. 23. S^^ of this above, Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 5.
Andye^ again more plainly in his 20. Book against Fau^tus, Cap. 21. it
follows; Vt Baptismus dicitur sepulchrum; sic, H^c est corpus meum.
says first, that under the Law Christ was promised In the similitude of their
Sacrifices: meaning, his bloody death was prefigured by those bloody
Sacrifices. Secondly, in the offering at his Passion he was Delivered up in
truth, or proper Sacrifice, this was on the Cross. And thirdly, after his
Ascension, The memory of Him is celebrated by a Sacrament, or Sacramental
Representation. So he. For although the Sacrifices of the Jews were true
Sacrifices, yet were they not truly the Sacrificings of Christ. Note you this
Assertion. Again, speaking of his own Time, when the Sacrament of the
Eucharist was daily celebrated, he says, That Christ was once sacrified
(namely upon the Cross) and Is now daily sacrificed in the Sacrament; nor
shall he lie (says he) that says Christ is sacrificed. So he.

No, holy Augustine, shall he not lie, who says that Christ, as the personal
Subject of this Sacrament, is a proper Sacrifice in the literal Sense? (for,
whether Proper or Improper, are the two Seals of this Controversy.) Now
interpose your Catholic Resolution. Say first, why is it called a Sacrament?
tell us; See above Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 8. out of his Epist. 23. ad
Bonifacium.
If Sacraments had not a similitude of things, which they represent, they were
no Sacraments, from which similitude they have their Appellation and name of
the things (to wit) The Sacrament of the Body of Christ is called his Body, as
Baptism is called a Burial. Be so good as to explain this by another, which
may illuminate even a man, in the point of Sacrifice also, although otherwise
blinded with prejudice. Epist. 23. ad Bonifac. Paulo ante verba superiora,
nempe, Pascha Appropinquante saepe dicimus crastinam Domini passionem, cum ille
ant^ multos (...) passus fit, nec omnino nisi semelista passio facta (...),
nempe isto die: (dicin us) Christus resurrexit, cum ex quo resurrexit tot Anni
transierunt, cum nemo ita ineptus sit qui nos ita loquentes arg^at nos esee
men^^tos -- ut dicatur ipse Dies, quia non est ipse, sed similis -- nonne semel
immolatus est Christus? etc.
As when the day of Christ's Passion (faith he) being to morrow, or the day of
his Resurrection about to be the next day but one; we use to say of the former,
To morrow is Christ's Passion; and of the other, when it comes, it is
Christ's Resurrection, yet will none be so absurd as to say, we lie in so
saying, because we speak it by way of Similitude: even so when we say, this is
sacrificed, etc. So Saint Augustine.

Who now sees not, that as the Burial of Christ is not the Subject matter of
Baptism, but only the Representative Object thereof; and as Good Friday, and
Easter Day, are not properly the days of Christ his Passion or Resurrection,
but Anniversary, and Represensative, or Commemorative Resemblances of them: So
this Sacrifice is a Similitude of the Sacrifice of Christ's on the Cross, and
not materially the same. We omit Testimonies of other Fathers, which are
dispersed in this and other Sections. Although this one Explanation might
satisfy, yet shall we adjoyne others, which may satiate even the greediest
Appetite.

The fourth Demonstration, from the Fathers Explanation of their meaning, by a
kind of Correction.

SECT. VI.
ANcient Fathers in good number call that, which is represented in the
Eucharist, and which we are said to offer, The same Host, not many; the same
Oblation, no other; the same Sacrifice, and none but it: but they add by a
Figure (...), that is, a Correction of the excess of their speech, or rather
for Cautionsake, (least their Readers might conceive of the same Sacrifice
herein as properly present) saying in this manner; We offer the same Sacrifice,
or Rather the Remembrance thereof; alluding sometime expressly to the
Institution of Christ, [Doe this in remembrance of me.] The Fathers are these,
viz. Chrysostom. in Heb. 10. Hom. 17. page 1171. [Christus semper suo sanguine
intrat] Ipse Sacrificium Sacerdos, and Hostia: si hoc non esset, multa
oportebat etiam Sacrificia offerri, saep. us oportebat crucifigi. -- Eandem
ipsam Hostiam, quam Christus immolabat, offerimus, [(...),] vel potius
Recordationem ipsisius, etc.
Chrysostom, Theophylact. in Heb. 10. page 885, 886. Nunc and ipsi sine
sanguine immolamus? Ita quide^, Sed Christi tunc reminiscimur obitus: and una
nobis est immolatio, non multae, quandoquide^ and ille semel immolatus est.
Eundem semper offerimus, quin po^s Oblationis illius memoriam facimus, perinde
ac si esset hoc tempore immolatus. Quocirca unum effe hoc nost^um Sacrificium
constat. -- Vnicum est and semel oblatum -- nam and unus est sanguis, and semel
fosus.
Theophylact, Theod. in Hebr. cap. 8. Cumeffecitur alia Sacrificia non essent
necessaria, cur novi Testamenti Sacerdotes mysticam Liturgiam seu Sacrificio^^
peragant? sed clarum est iis, qui sunt in rebu^ divini^ eruditi, nos non aliud
Sacrificium offerre, sed unius illius sal^taris memoriam peragere -- Dixit
enim, Hoe facite in memoriam mei.
Thodoret, Ambros. in Heb. 10 Offerimus quidem, sed Recordationem salutaris
mortis ejus, and una haec Hostia, non multae.
Ambrose, Eusebius. Demonst. Evangelic. lib. 1. cap. 10. Sacrificamus and
incendim^is, a^^as autem magni Sacrificii illius memoriam, (...).
Eusebius, and Primasius in Heb. cap. 10. Quod Deus etc. Offer^^^ quidem
Sacer^^^es nostri, sed ad reco^dationem mortis ejus -- sicut ipse dixit, Hoc
facit^ in Commemo rationem (...) -- Vn^ hostia, non multae -- Corpus unum cum
illo, quod suscepit in utero virginali, non autem multa Corpora, nec nunc
quidem aliud magnum, aliud minu^.
Primasius.

Your only Answer is, that their Exception, here used, was not to note that it
is not the same Body of Christ here Corporally present, which was offered upon
the Cross, but that it is not offered in the same manner by effusion of Blood,
as that was; which is indeed a Part, but not the whole Truth. For survay the
Marginals, and then tell us; If that your Sacrifice were the same Body of
Christ Corporally present, why should Theophylact apply h^s qualification not
to the manner, whether Bloody or Unbloody, but to the person of Christ,
saying,* We offer the same Christ, who was once offered, or rather a Memorial
of his Oblation? And Theodoret applying it directly to the thing, [Non aliud]
We offer not another Sacrifice, but a memorial thereof? why Eusebius, We
offer a Memorial in stead of a Sacrifice? plainly notifying unto it is, that
they meant the same very Body, which was the Subject of the Sacrifice on the
Cross, to be the now proper Object of our Remembrance in the Eucharist, but
not the Subject therein.

Which agrees with that which in the former Section was said by Ambrose, Our
offering up of Christ in an Image; and Augustine his celebrating of this
Sacrament of Remembrance. Semblably, as Hierome speaks of the Priest, who is
said to take the Person of Christ in this Sacrament, so that, He (says Hier.
Tom. 5. lib. 13. Com. in Ezech. cap. 44. Qui offerat Deo Sacrificium, ita ut
verus Sacerdos sit, imo Imitator ejus, qui est Sacer ^o^ secundum ordinem
Mele^izedech. Idem Tom. 9. lib. 4. cap. 26. in Match. Sicut Melchizedech panem
and vinum offerem, ipse quo que veritatem corporis and sanguinis sui
repraesentet.
Hierome) be a a true Priest, or rather an Imitator of him. But a Priest and an
Imitator is not Identically the same that is represented. Master Breeley is not
Christ. Lastly, The same (said Primasius) in all places, which was borne of the
Virgin, and not now great, and now less. So he. But have we not heard you
number your many Hoasts on one Altar, at one Time? and yet the Fathers say, We
offer not many, but the same, which must needs be the same one, as Object; else
show us where ever any Father denied but that upon diverse Altars were diverse
Breads; or that but, according to their outward Demensions, they were now
greater, now less; which no way agrees with the Body of Christ, as has been
proved in discussing the Sea above Book 4. cap. 9. Sect. 4.
Canon of the Council of Nice.

The fifth Demonstration: Because the Body and Blood of Christ, as they are
pretended by the Romish Church to be in this Sacrament, cannot be the
Representative Sacrifice spoken of by Ancient Fathers; against your vain
Instance in a Stage Play.

SECT. VII.
THat the Subject matter of this Sacrament (by you called the same Sacrifice,
which Christ offered up upon the Cross) ought to be Representative, and fit to
resemble the same Sacrifice of his Passion, is a matter unquestionable among
all. In which respect the Fathers have so often called it a Sacrifice of
Commemoration, Representation, and Remembrance; and that the thing to be
represented is his Body crucified, and his Blood shed in that Sacrifice of his
Passion, is a point as questionless, which accords both to the words of
Christ his Institution [Doe this in remembrance of me,] and to the Exposition
of Saint Paul, to be a [shewing fo^th of the Lords death until he come:] yea
and is also consonant to the last mentioned Doctrine of the Fathers, calling it
A Sacrifice of Christ, or rather a Remembrance thereof.

The only Question will be, how This, which you call The same Sacrifice,
meaning the Body of Christ subjectively in the Eucharist, being invisible, can
be said to represent, figure, and resemble the same Body, as it was the
Sacrifice on the Cross? We yielding unto you a possibility, that one thing, in
some respects, may be a Representation of it self. Your Tridentine Fathers to
this purpose say, that Co^. Trid. Christum reliquisse Sacrificium Ecclesiae
suae visibil^, quo cruentum illud in cruce peragendum repraesentaretur. Sess.
22. cap. 1.
Christ left this visible Sacrifice to his Church, whereby his Body sacrified
upon the Cross should be represented. So they. From whom (it may seem) your
Rhemists learned that lesson, which they taught Others, that Rhemists Annot. in
Luc. 22.
Christ's Body, once visibly sacrificed upon the Cross, In and By the self
same Body is immolated and sacrificed under the shapes of Bread and Wine, and
is most perfectly thereby resembled: and therefore i^ most properly
Commemorative; being called the same Sacrifice by the Ancient Fathers. And
again, This nearely and lively resembles that. So they. But this we utterly
deny, because although a thing may in some sort be represented by it self, yet
(say we) there is no Representative quality of any Body and Blood of Christ (as
it is said by you to be in the Eucharist) of his Body and Blood Sacrificed upon
the Cross. And upon the Truth or Untruth of this our Assertion depends the
gaining or losing of the whole Cause, concerning the Question of Sacrifice, now
controverted between us.

Two of yout Jesuits have undertaken to manifest your Representation (by a more
fit example than do your Rhemists) thus; Barradas Ies. Eri tibi stupendam Dei
adinventionem notam facimus. Animo concipiamus Regem aliquem post reportatam de
Hostibus Victoriam, etc. Sic Christi corpus veluti in scena per^onatur, i. e.
speciebus panis and vini velatur, etc. Tom. 4 Concord. Evang. lib. 3. cap. 13..
Optimus. And Bellarmine.
Even as a King (say They) having got a Victory, should represent himself,
after his war, in a Stage Play in sight, etc. So they, even in earnest, which
has been as earnestly, yet easily; confuted by us [See above 2. Book, Chap.
2. Sect. 6. there answered.] Corpus and sanguis Domini sub specie panis and
vini signa sunt corporis ejus passi, and sanguinis effusi, etc. See above also
in the same place, Cha. 3.
already; although, indeed, the Play deserves but laughter: and that so much
the rather, because the Representative part (as your Council of See hereafter,
Cha. 6. Sect. 1.
Trent has defined) is in your Mass a visible Sacrifice, whereby the Bloody
Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross might be represented, as you have heard.

CHALLENGE.
YOu (except you will be Players, and not Disputers) must tell us, where ever
it was seen or heard of a King, as Conqueror; or yet of any other, of what
condition soever, acting himself, and that visibly, perfectly, and truly (as
you have said) yea or else any way semblably representing himself, when as yet
the same King, or party, was to all the Spectators altogether Invisible? If you
can, then show where this was acted, whether it were not in Vtopia? and who was
the Actor, if not (...)? and of what disposition the Spectators were, whether
not like the man of Argos, who is said daily to have frequented the Theater and
Stage alone, void of all Actors, yet seeming to himself to see all Varieties
of Actions, occasioning him to laugh, and applaud at that which he saw
represented to himself only in his own fantastical brain?

Now have you nothing else to answer, but (which you have already said) that
The Body and Blood in the Eucharist are visible, by the visible shapes of Bread
and Wine. Whereas it had been much better you had answered, indeed, nothing at
all, rather than not only to contradict that, which was said by your Fathers of
Trent, (decreeing the Representation to be made By the Sacrifice on the Altar
it self; and more expressly by your See above, at (b)
Rhemists, In and by the same Body in the Eucharist:) but also to expose your
selves to the reproof of your Adversaries, and Scorn of any man of Common
sense; as if you would persuade him his money is Visible to any that will use
his eyes, which he has therefore locked up close in his Coffer, least any man
might see it. But this we have discussed sufficiently in the 2. Book, and 2.
Chapter,. 6.

The sixth Demonstration of the no- Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, because
diverse Epithets objected, as given by Fathers to this Sacrifice, are used also
by them where there is no Proper Sacrifice.

SECT. VIII.
IT is objected by your Cardinal, that Ancient Fathers gave certain Epithets,
and Attributes to the Eucharist, 1. Some calling it a Full and pure; 2. some
terrible Service; 3. some termed it in the plural number Sacrifices and
Victimes; and 4. some Anunbloody Sacrifice. So he, Bellom. lib. 5. de Miss,
cap. 5 Quinto -- Parts ad nomen Sacrificii Epitheta ^ae, e addunt, quae soli
vero Sacrificio convenient, and quae inepte dicerent de ^ola ^^ praesentatione.
Cyp. li. 2. Epist. 3. Plenum and verum Sacrificium. Chrysostom. Hom. ad pop.
Antioch and omnes Graeci, Passion terribile Sacrificium and horroris plenum.
Aug. lib. ^0. de Civit. Dei, cap. 20. Summum verumque Sacrificium. Eusebius. lib.
1. Demonst. Evang. cap. ult. Sacricrificium Deo plenu^. [This last is not
undoubtedly spoken of the Eucharist.] Ibid.. Secundo. -- Si Patres putassent
Sacrificium Eucharistiae non esse Sacrificium nisi repraesentativum, nunquam
dixissent in numero multitudinis offe: ri Deo Victin as, and Sacrificia. Of the
Epithete (Unbloody) in the next Section.
concluding from each of these, that they meant thereby a Proper Sacrifice in
the Eucharist. We encounter all these four kind of Instances with like
Epithets given by the same August. de Civitat. Dei, lib. 10. cap. 6. Verum
Sacrificium omne opus bonum, ut Deo adhaereamus, factum. Tertull. In omni loco

Fathers to other Things (in your own judgment) improperly called Sacrifices;
as namely to Prayers, Praises, giving Thanks, and Hymns, instiled True, Pure,
and Clean, and the only perfect Sacrifices, by Primitive Fathers. Secondly,
they are as zealous concerning the second Cyrill. Apol. Lectio Scripturatum
terribilium. Test I well^ art. 17. Chrysostom. in 1. Corinthians. M^m. 40. De
Baptismate pauld post initi^^, post pronunciationem (...).
point, in terming holy Scriptures Terrible; the Rules touching Baptism,
Terrible words, and Horrible Canons; and the Christian, duly considering the
nature of Baptism, One compassed about with Horror and Astonishment. Whereof
more See Book 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 1.
hereafter. And indeed what is there, whereby we have any apprehension of Gods
Majesty, and Divine Attributes, which does not work a holy Dread in the hearts
of the Godly?

And the third Instance is as idle as any of the rest, because the holy E^seb.
lib. 1 Demonst Evang cap. 10. Po^^o has rursus incorporeas and intelligentia
praeditas hostias prophetica nunciant orac^la. Immola Deo Sacrificium laudis
and Orationes sanctas, etc. Just. Martyr. Dialog. cum Tryphon. page 269.
Supplicationes and gratiarum actiones solas esse charas Victimas Deo.
Fathers named Prayers, Giving of Thanks, and other holy Actions, Sacrifices,
and Hoasts, in the plural number. And is not there in the Eucharist, Prayers,
Hymns, and Thanksgivings? nay, but know, that in as much as the Fathers have
called the Eucharist in the plural number Hoasts, and Sacrifices, it proves
that they were not of your Romish Belief of Concomitancy, to think (with you)
that Bread being changed into Christ's Body, and Wine into his Blood, make but
one Sacrifice; for there can be no Identity in Plurality. The Answer to the
fourth Epithete follows.

The seventh Demonstration of no- Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist: Because
the principal Epithet of Unbloody Sacrifice, used by the Fathers, and most
urgently objected by your Doctors, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice, does
evince the Contrary.

SECT. IX.
IT has been some pains unto us, to collect the objected Testimonies of
Fathers, for this point, out of your diverse Writers, which you may peruse now
in the Margent, with more ease, and presently percelve, both what makes not
for you, and what against you; but certainly for you just nothing at all. For
what can it help your cause, that the Celebration of the Eucharist is often
called (...), that is, An unbloody Sacrifice, a Reasonable and unbloody Service
or Worship?

In the first place three Basil. in his Mass, ob. by Salmero (...), Tom. 9.
Tract. 30.. Sed contutans: and by Lindanus Panop. lib. 4. cap. 53. Nos
app^opinquantes Altari tuo sulcipere, and dignissimos offerre hanc (...),
(Lindanus, non carnis, sed mentis) (...). Salmeron Ies. Absque sanguine
hostiam: and admit (...). [And not till long aster the words of Consecration,
beginning at [Respice, Domine.] Missa Chrysostom. Ob. abe^sdem qo supra. Hanc
nostram supplicationem, tanquam ad Altar, admittere non recuses, and ^ac nos
idoncos qui Tibi (...) nostris prop^^^atis offeramus. Idem Sa^neron. Offerimus
Tibi rationabile and incruencum obs quium. [Which words are in the body of your
Liturgies put before the words of Consecration (Edit. Aatuer^. ex officina
Plantin. 1960. cum privilegio Regis.) but which Lindan will have to be s^t
after Consecration.] The Liturgy of S. ^ames: Pro oblatis, sanctificatis,
pretiosis, immaculatis donis divinis oremus Dominum -- acceptis eis in
supercoeleste, mentale, spirituale Altar, in odorem spiritualis fragrantiae,
etc. Paulo post: Deus Pater, qui oblata tibi dona mera, frugum oblationes
accepisti in odorem suavitatis. [And after follows the words of Consecration:
Sancto, qui in Sanctis, etc. -- Suscipe incorruptum Hymnum in sanctis and
incruentis Sacrificiistuis.]
Liturgies, or (if you will) Masses are objected, to prove that by unbloody
Sacrifice, and Reasonable and unbloody worship, is betokened the Sacrifice of
Christ's body and blood in the Mass; one of Basil, another of Chrysostom, and
(by some others) the Mass of Saint James of Jerusalem. In which Epithet of
Unbloody (say we) could not be signified Christ's body. Our reasons: because
(as the Margent shows) the word Unbloody has sometime Relation unto the
Bread and Wine (both unbloody) before Consecration, called in Saint James his
Liturgy, Gods gifts of the first fruit of the ground: who also reckons Hymns
among unbloody Sacrifices: (But Christ's Body is the fruit of the womb) or
else sometime is it referred to the Acts of Celebration, in Supplication,
Thanksgiving, and Worship of God (all unbloody) naming that Areasonable and
unbloody Service, which they had termed an unbloody Sacrifice, as Lindan your
Parisian Doctor has truly observed. Which Chrysostom also styled Spiritual
(mark you) (...), Service, or Worship. Was ever Christ called (...), who is
himself rather the person to be worshipped?

Secondly, Reasonable, could this point out Christ's Body in the sense of the
objected Fathers? suffer Chrysostom to resolve us. Chrysostom. Hom. 11. Quid est
rationabile obsequium? quod per animam, quod secundum Spiritum offerrur:
quicquid non indige^ corpore, quicquid non indiget instrumentis, neque locis,
in quibus ipse quidem est Pontifex, ut mansuetudo, patientia, etc. Sacrificium
laudis, justitiae, spiritus contribula^i.
Reasonable Service (says he) is that which is performed with the mind,
without Bodily help.

Thirdly, The unbloody Sacrifice is called Spiritual (as you hear) how shall
this be properly applied to the Body of Christ? You will say, not in it is
natural Essence, but in the manner of being Invisible, Impalpable, and the
like. But we demand; the same head of a man's Body, is it more Spiritual in the
dark than in the light?

Lastly, all these terms in these Liturgies of Unbloody Sacrifice, Reasonable
Service, and Spiritual, are spoken before Consecration, when the Body of
Christ, even in your own Faith, as yet can have no being in the Eucharist; and
therefore cannot be the Unbloody Sacrifice here meant by you. Will you have the
full substance of all these Reasons? The word, Unbloody, whether it point out
Bread and Wine, or the Act of outward worship in this celebration, called a
Reasonable Service, and Spiritual Sacrifice, it must betoken a thing void of
Blood, which no Christian Professor dare attribute to the Body of Christ. We
proceed.

Eusebius says indeed, (...). Eusebius. Caesar. l. 4. de vita Constant. c. 45. de
Euth. Al^i sacras literas interpreta^tur: Alii (...), and myst^s
consecrationibus diuinum numen placabant, and supplices preces pro communi pace
offerebant. Et Demonst. lib. 1. cap. 6. Sacrificium mundum.
We offer an unbloody Sacrifice; but what he meant thereby, he does not
express, whether the Signs of Bread and Wine, which he elsewhere with others
(as you have heard) called Sacrifices: or whether, as Basil and Chrysostom
have done, he understood together the public Service in celebrating the Memory
of Christ's Death. This then concludes not for an Existence of the Body of
Christ, as of the Unbloody Subject herein. But whereas furthermore you may
observe that Eusebius (objected) calls Non per cruores, sed per quas actiones
summo Deo offerendas. After, there ^olloneth an Oration of Constant ne, Ad
Sanctorum coetum. Tale Sacrificium peragitur, vacuum languine, and ab omni
violen ia. As ^ob. Dad^us D^ctor Paris. transtateth it.
Godly Actions a pure Sacrifice, and opposes this against Bloody Sacrifices;
and also terms Again, Demonst. Evang. lib. 1. cap. 10. Has rursus [(...)] i.
e. materiae expertia Sacrificia, intelligentia praeditas hostias, Prophetica
nunciant oracula? Immola Deo Sacrificium laudis -- Hymnos and sanctas Orationes
celebrantes.
Holy Prayers [(...)] that is, without Material Substance, as he did the
Celebration of the Sacrament [(...),] that is, Unbloody: These show that
Eusebius meant a Sacrifice void of Blood; which neither the word of God will
permit us; nor your Council of Trent will suffer you to impute to the Body of
Christ, and therefore must needs wound your Roman Oblation of Body and Blood to
the very heart.

Nazianzene (objected) is as directly opposite to your Mass, as East is to
West, and will strike the matter dead, calling it Nazianz. Invect. 1. adversus
Julian. ante med. [(...)] i. e. Ve ab incruento Sacrificio manus elueret, per
quod nos Christo, ipsiusque passionibus, and divinitate communicamus. [Marke,
Incruentum, per quod, is distinguished from, Christo, therefore was not Christ
the Incruentum, objected by the Rhemists Annot. in Luc. 22. 19.]
The unbloody Sacrifice, whereby (says he) we communicate with Christ: Flatly
differencing the unbloody Sacrifice, whereby, from Christ himself, with whom
the Faithful do communicate in this Sacrament.

Ambrose (objected) prays to God, Ambros. lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 6. Sacerdos
dicit, Ergo memores glorios^ssimae ejus passionis, offerimus Tibi immaculatam
hanc Hostiam incruentam, and hunc panem sanctum, and hanc oblationem salutis
aeternae.
To accept of this immaculate, and unbloody Host, which are the very words of
your Roman Suseipias in sublimi Al^i tuo, per manus Angelorum, sicut accipere
dignatus ^s munera Abel, etc.] To be expounded, as Bellarmine does almost the
same words in the Roman Mass.
Mass, and which your Cardinal seeks to justify by S. Ambrose. But this he
cannot do, except their meaning be both the same. Let then your Cardinal but
tell us the meaning of the Canon of your Mass, and you will soon apprehend
the Judgment of Saint Ambrose. In our Mass (says your Accipiendo Sacrificium
pro re, quae sacrificatur, negari non debet panem and vinum aliquo modo in
Missa offerri, ac proinde pertinere ad rem, quae sacrificatur. Nam cum ante
Consecrationem dicimus [Suscipe, Pater, hanc immaculatam Hostiam] certe
Pronomen, Hanc, demonstrat ad sensum id quod manibus tenemus, id autem panis
est. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27.. Respondeo ut. [Because the Cardinal
does often in this and other Chapters justify the Roman term of Mass, by
the like in Ambrose.]
Cardinal) it is said, Receive, holy Father, this immaculate* Host; where the
Pronoune This (says he) does demo astrate Bread and Wine, because spoken
before Consecration. So he. And the Body and Blood of Christ (you know) are not
Bread and Wine. Let Athanasius put Per^od to this Section, who says that
Athanes. Melchizedech dedit Abrahamo vinum meracum addito panis ((...)) frusto
-- hic typus fuit offerendi Sacrificium [(...)] meruentum san^ oblationem.
Hist. de Melchizedeth. ad sinem. Tom. 2.
Melchizedech) in giving ^read and Wine, was the first Type of an unbloody
Sacrifice. But Melchizedech's was Unbloody, negatively, having no Blood at all
in it. So was never the Body of Christ since his Resurrection, according to our
Christian Belief.

CHALLENGE.
WHat a fair piece of service (do you think) have these Objecters done, for
the patronizing of your Roman Sacrifice, out of the Sentences of Ancient
Fathers? whilst they, alleging their words, citing their Books, and quoting
their Chapters, have so handled the matter, as if they had meant, by
prevaricating in their own Cause, to betray it: seeing that it is apparent,
that they have delivered unto us the worship, in stead of the thing worshipped,
out of the Council of Ephesus, Basil, Chrysostom, and Eusebius: Next by the
word, Unbloody, being spoken before Consecration (and therefore concerns not
the Unbloody Body of Christ) they have obtruded the thing, Distinguished from
Christ, instead of Christ, in the Testimony of Nazianzene. But especiaily,
because in the [Doe but examine the places again, and you shall find Basil to
have spoken of Service before Consecration? Chrysostom. Of Blood (...) Wine,
before Consecration: Eusebius in one place is inter preted (by your own Doctor
and Translator) to have spoken of a Sacrifice void of Blood; Nazianzene
speaks of something in the Eucharist, differing from Christ: to whom you may
join Athanasius.]
most, of the Sentences, the word, Unbloody, must needs be taken negatively for
want, or absence of of Blood: and so you may bid your Corporal Presence adi^u*
All which may be strong Arguments unto us, both of the deplorable Consciences
of your Doctors, and of the desperateness of your Cause. Other Testimonies,
wherein there is mention of Christ's Body and Blood, come now to be discussed.

A Confirmation of the former Demonstration, from the use of the word,
Unbloody, in the objected Sentences, wherein the Fathers make mention of the
Body and Blood of Christ.

SECT. X.
THis Objection seems to be of better moment than the former: but only
seems. Clemens Bishop of Rome, the first of that name, calls (indeed) the
Eucharisticall Celebration Clemens Romans Constable. lib. 6. cap. 2^. Pro Sacrifieio
c^uento, Rationale and incruentum; ac illud mysticum Sactificium corporis and
sanguinis Christ^, quod insymbolum more ejus c^ lib. ^Const. cap. 26. Adhuc
agimus Tibi gratias, Pater nost^r, pro pretioso corpore and san^ cuj^ A^typa
celebramus, ut mortem ejus denuntiaremus, per ipsum enim Tibl glori^. Athen.
(...) unbloody Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ. In which sentence
the Unbloody Sacrifice is plainly distinguished from the Body and Blood,
whereof it is a Sacrifice; even as both the Act* and Service of Commemoration
have been oftentimes above, and are hereafter called of the Fathers a
Sacrifice, in respect of the Object thereof, which is the Body and Blood of
Christ on the Cross. This is manifest by two especial Reasons; the first,
because that which he calls Unbloody, he terms also a Reasonable Service.

Secondly, Clemens calls the same Unbloody Sacrifice the Sign and Type of
Christ's Body and Blood, thereby distinguishing them from that Body and Blood
whereof they are but Types. You will then ask, what is this Body and Blood,
whereof they are said to be Types? Yea marry, This being known will set all
straight. And Clemens tells you, that it is his Precious Body, and his Blood
shed, which (properly taken) all Christians profess to be Proper to his Body
crucified, and Blood shed on the Cross, for the proper object of our Typical
Remembrance, as we have formerly proved, and you your selves confessed already.

Tract. 30.
Cyril of Jerusalem does attend upon Pope Clemens, and in a sort treads in
his steps. The manner of our Celebrating the memory of Christ's death, he
calls a Spiritual Sacrifice, and an Unbloody worship; wherein, against the
Jewish Sacrifice, he opposes Spiritual against Corporal, as he does Unbloody
against Bloody. But by, Spiritual, he meant that which wants a Body.
Therefore by, Unbloody, he meant that which was properly void of Blood. So
far was Cyril from signifying thereby the Unbloody Body of Christ, as the
subject matter in the Eucharist. As for the Body and Blood of Christ it self,
which he calls Propitiation, Cyril expounds himself to mean (for so he
names it) Christ slain for our sins, which still we say, and you cannot
deny, is only the Object of our whole spiritual service of Remembrance and
Commemoration. Both these former Witnesses have delivered their Testimonies, as
spoken under a form of Prayer, whereunto whether You or Protestants may more
justly say Amen, judge you.

The eighth Demonstration of the no- Proper Sacrifice of the Mass; Because the
Ancient Fathers called the Eucharist a Bloody Sacrifice, which all you will
confess to be Improperly spoken.

SECT. XI.
TAke but unto you your own Allegations (set down in the Salmeron. Tom. 9.
Tract. 29. page 225. Hesychius lib. 2. cap. 8. in Levit. Dicit Christum cum

Margent) of the Sentences of Antiquit^, and you shall find how the Ancient
Fathers doubted not to say that Christ suffers, is slain, slays himself,
suffers often in this Sacrament: and that His Passion and bloody Sacrifice is
offered herein. Sayings of the highest Accent, as you see, and of no fewer nor
meaner Fathers than these, Alexander, and Gregory both Popes, Chrysostom,
Cyprian, Hierome, Cyril of Jerusalem, Hesychius, Pascatius. What think you of
such sayings? Can Christ be said properly to be Dead in this Sacrament? Quis
unquam Catholicus dixit Christum rursus more? R^bera Ies. Com. in Heb. 10. number.
25.
Never any Catholic said so (says your Jesuit Ribera.) What then could be the
meaning of such words? If you should be ignorant, your Cardinal Alan would
teach you, and he would have you Observandum est Christum ^icet modo
impassibili existat in Sacramento, tamen dici a Pat^ ibus mortalem, imo mortuum
and pass^m in Sacramento, eatenus quidem, quatenus ex modo Consecrationis,
ipsaque vi significationis Sacramentalis mors, and passio Domini commemorantur
atque repraesentantur. Alan. Card. lib. 1. de Euch. cap. 38. sub finem.
Observe what he says: Christ is said by the Fathers to suffer (says he) and
to die in this Sacrament only so far as his Death and Passion is commemorated
and represented herein. And so speaks also your Roman Gloss^ de Consecrat.
Did. 2. Quid sir. Hoc est, ejus Mors repraesentatur.
Gloss.

What now hinders but that whenever we hear the same Fathers affirming that
the same Body and Blood of Christ are Sacrificed in the Eucharist, we
understand them in the same impropriety of speech, that they meant only
Representatively? especially when as we see your other grand Cardinal coming
somewhat home toward us, and to confess as follows; Bellarm. lib. 1. de
Missa, cap. 25.. Respondeo si, etc. Si Catholici dicerent in Sacrificio Missae
vere Christum mori, argumentum Calvini haberet aliquid viriu^: sed cum dicunt
omnes eum non mori, nisi in Sacramento and signo repraesentante mortem ejus,
quam aliquando obiir, tantum abest, ut Missa obliteret Christi mortem, ut
potius efficiat ut nunquam obliteretur.
If Catholics should say that Christ does truly die in this Sacrament, this
Argument might be of some force: but they say he dies not; but in a Sacrament
and Sign representing. So he; which yet alas is too little a Crevase for so
great a Doctor to creep out at. First, because there is as well a Figurative,
as there is a literal Truth; for, If I should say of Easter day (said See
above, chap. 5. Sect. 3.
Augustine) it is the day of Christ's Resurrection, I should not lie, and yet
it is but the Anniversary day, betokening the other. When Christ said of one
part of this Sacrament, [This Cup is the new Testament in my Blood] he spoke by
a double figure, said your Jesuit Book 2. chap. 2. Sect. 4.
Salmeron, yet truly.

Secondly Christ, who is Truth it self, in saying of Bread, This is my Body,
or Flesh, spoke a Truth, as you all profess; and was it not likewise a Truth,
when he called his Flesh Bread? yea, and also Io^. 6.
The true Bread.

Thirdly, the Fathers, as they said that Christ is dead, and suffers (as you
now object) in this Sacrament in a Mystery: so have They also said of his
Body, in respect of the Eucharist, It is sacrificed in an Ambrose, August.
above, Chap. 5. Sect. 5.
Image, in a Sacrament, or Mystery, according to that their general
Qualification, saying, It is the same Sacrifice which Christ offered, or Above,
Chap. 5. Sect. 6.
Rather a Remembrance thereof.

And lastly, the Fathers, who named Baptism a Sacrifice as well as the
Eucharist* doubted not to stretch Baptism up to as high a note as they have
done the Eucharist, saying, Chrys^^t. in Epist. ad Heb. Hom. 16. Baptismus est
passio Christi.
Baptism is the passion of Christ: and Ambros. de P^^nitent. lib. 2. cap. 1.
In Baptismo crucifigimus in nobis filium Dei.
In Baptism we crucify Christ. To signify, that the Body of Christ is the
Represented Object, and not the Representative Subject of this Sacrament.

An Elucidation of the Premises, by a Similitude of a Stage Play, manifesting
how the same Improper Sacrifice might furthermore have been called both Bloody
and Unbloody, by Ancient Fathers.

SECT. XII.
A Similitude, for explanation sake, would be had; give us leave to borrow one
from the Stage Play, for manifesting a Truth, as well as Bo^ke 2. Chap. 2.
Sect. 6. and Book 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 7.
you have done another from thence, for palliating a Falsehood. You may
recognize with us that Tragical end of the Emperor Mauritius, by the command
of one Phocas, (once his slave) that grand Patron of the Popedom, by
privileging the Church of Rome, to be the Head of all Churches, as diverse of
your own Historians do relate. But to the point. By the commandment of this
Phocas (as you See Baren. Anno ^02. etc.
know) were slain two of Mauritius his sons, three daughters, and his wife,
and all these before his own eyes, and at last the Emperor Mauritius himself
was also murdered.

Were now this doleful Spectacle acted on a Stage, might not any Spectator say
(at the horrid sight thereof) This is a bloody Tragedy, namely, in respect of
the Object represented herein? And might he not also say as truly, This is an
Unbloody Tragedy? to wit, in respect of the representative Subject, Action,
and Commemoration it self, wherein there is not shed any one drop of man's
Blood? And from the same Evidence it will be easy to perceive, that the Greek
Fathers used to term the Eucharist [(...)] and the Latins Tremendum, that is,
a Terrible and Dreadful Sacrifice, (namely) for the Semblance-sake, and
Analogy it has with Christ's Death: even as one would call the Act,
representing the cruel Butchering of the Emperor Mauritius, an horrible and
lamentable Spectacle. This is a clear glass, wherein any may discern the
open visage of Truth, from the fained Vizard of Error.

The ninth Demonstration, Because Ancient Fathers likewise called the Sacrament
of Baptism a Sacrifice, for the Representation-sake which it has of Christ's
Death; which is Argumentum a paribus.

SECT. XIII.
WE shall not urge the Antecedent of this Argument, taken from Baptism, before
that we have made known the force of the Consequence thereof. First one of
your Cardinals thus, Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 15. Si Patres
existima^unt Eucharistiam solum ^sse Sacrament^^, and non etiam Sacrifici^,
nulla esset causa cur aliter loquere^tur de Eucharistia, quam de Baptismo.
Nusquam autem Patres Baptismum vocant Sacrificium, nec dicunt* Baptizare esse
Sacrificare, vel immolare. Quo modo igitur possible est Patres in modo l^quendi
nobiscum; in sententia cum Adversariis conveni^^e?. Hic igitur. Ru^sus,
Baptismus est Sacramentum Repraesentationis mortis Christi, Romans 6. Et tamen
nulli veterum baptismum Sacrificium Deo oblatum unquam appellaverunt: non
igitur sola repraesentatio causa esse po^uit, cur actio coenae Sacrificium
appellaretur. Ibid.. Tert. bapt.
If the Fathers had held the Eucharist only a Sacrament, and not also a
Sacrifice, there had been no cause why they should not have called Baptism a
Sacrifice, it being a Representation of Christ's death: But the Fathers do no
where call Baptism a Sacrifice. So he. Another Cardinal thus, Card. Alan.
Patres a^usos esse nomine Sacrificii -- quis possit cum Haereticis vel tenuiter
suspicari, cum hoc solum eo nomine app^llent, nec alteri fere Sacramento unquam
tribuunt? Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 14.
Who can so much as suspect that the Fathers spoke abusively, in calling the
Eucharist a Sacrifice, seeing this is the only Sacrament, which they call a
Sacrifice, and no other. Next, take your learned Jesuit with you, who would
be loath to come behind any in vehemence and boldness, thus; Suarez Ies. In
mu^tis Conc. vocatur hoc Sacrificium incruentum -- Solum est observandum,
propter Hae^eticos, qui hoc etiam ad metaphoram detorquenr nomen, Sacrificium.
Sanctos Patres nunquam vocasse Ministerium Baptismi, aut alterius Sacramenti
nomine Sacrificii, cum tamen Sacrificiu^ M^taphorice sumptu^ in eo conveniet.
Cum ergo Eucharistiam simpliciter and absolutissime Sacrificium vocant, signum
est ^os proprie de Sacrificio loqui. Tom. 3. Disp. 74. Sect. 2. p. 952.
Ancient Fathers never called Baptism or the Ministry thereof a Sacrifice;
albeit they might have so called it Metaphorically: which we note (says he)
because of the Heretics, who pervert the speeches of the Fathers, as if they
had called the Eucharist a Sacrifice Metaphorically, and improperly. So they,
to omit M. Fisher, ^or one.
Others. Now then if there be any sap or sense in these your Objectors, it is
as much as if they had reasoned against us thus; If you Heretics (for so they
call Protestants) could s^ew that the Ancient Fathers did any where name the
Sacrament of Baptism a Sacrifice, which we confess to be only a
Representation of Christ's death, then should we need no other Reason to
persuade us that the Fathers called the Sacrament of the Eucharist a Sacrifice
also Improperly, only because it represents the Body and Blood of Christ
Sacrificed on the Cross. Thus for the Consequence, confessed by your chiefest
Advocates.

The Assumption lies upon us to prove, to wit, that the Fathers called
Baptism a Sacrifice, even from the words of the Apostle, Heb. 10. 20. where,
speaking of Baptism; he says; To them that sin voluntarily there remains
no Sacrifice for sin. Saint Augustine testifies of the Doctors of the Church
Catholic, before his time, that H. b. 10 26. [Voluntarie pecc^ntibus non
relinquitur Sacrificiu^ pro peccato] Qui diligentius pertiactant hunc locum
Apostoli, intelligunt de Holocausto Dominicae passionis, quod eo tempore offert
qui^que pro peccatis suis, quo ejusdem passionis fide baptizatus: Vt sit
sensus, [Non relinquitur Sacrificium pro peccaris] hoc est, non potest denuo
baptizando purgari. August. Tom. 4. Expos. ad Romans Col. 1185, 1186, 1187.
They, who more diligently handled this Text, understood it of the Sacrifice of
Christ's Passion, which every one then offers, when he is baptized into the
faith of Christ. So that holy Father, who is a Witness without all Exception;
yet if, peradventure, we should need any testimony out of your own Schools,
the witness of your Canus may be sufficient, confessing and saving, Melchi^r
Canus. Quaeris quid Causae plerisque Antiquorum fuerit, ut Baptismum Hostiam
appellaverint, ideoque dixerint non superesse Hostiam pro peccato? (Heb. 10.)
quia Baptismus repeti non potest -- Et quia per Baptismum applicatur nobis
Hostia cr^cis. Hinc illi Baptisma translatitie Hostiam nuncuparunt. Loc. Theol.
lib. 12. cap. 12. page 424.
That most of the Fathers by Sacrifice in this place understood Baptism, which
they so called Metaphorically, because by it the Sacrifice of the ^rosse is
applied unto us. So he. Is not this enough for the understanding of the
Dialect, and of the speech of Ancient Fathers, both in calling Baptism a
Sacrifice, and of the Reason thereof, to wit, for Representation sake only;
and Consequently, that the Body and Blood of Christ are not the representing
Subject, but the represented Object of his Sacrifice? What better satisfaction
can the greatest Adversary desire, than to be (as now your Disputers are)
answered according to their own Demands?

The tenth Demonstration: Because the Fathers called the Eucharist a Sacrifice,
in respect of diverse such Acts as are excluded by the Romish Doctors, out of
the Definition of a Proper Sacrifice.

SECT. XIV.
THE Acts excluded by your Cardinal out of the number of Proper Sacrifices,
are Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2.. Sed omissa. Omne Sacrificium est
oblatio, sed non omnis oblatio Sacrificium, hoc fit cum r^s oblata consumitur.
Oblations, or Offerings of any thing thing that is not Consecrated by the
Priest, such as is the Offerings of Bread and Wine by the People, before it be
Consecrated. Next Bellarm. Opera virtutum non sunt proprie dicta Sacrificia.
Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2.. Haec. Non quae in sola action consistant, ut
Psalmodia, genuflexio, and opus quodlibet ad honorem Dei factum. Ib.. Secundum.
Non quae in sola oblatione fita, ut aurum, argentum, etc. Ibid.. Secundo. Non
decimae aut primitiae.. Sed in. Nec Patres appellant Sacrificium, id quod solum
est figura, and commemoratio Sacrificii.. Tertio. Non pia voluntas, quia
invisibilis.. Secundo. Non Eleemosynae, quia non soli Deo oblatae. Tertio.
Nulla reverentia externa, ut genuflexiones, preces, quia actiones transeuntes..
Sexto. Passiones Martyrum, and alia omnia bona opera, largo modo -- non autem
proprie and in rigore, Sacrificia dici possunt. Ibid. cap. 3.. Resp. Martyrum.
All works of Virtue are unproperly called Sacrifices. All works which
consist in Action, being transient, as bowing, singing of Psalms, or the sole
Commemoration of the Sacrifice of the Cross: together with all such Acts
performed to God, which otherwise are yielded to man, as the Gesture of
Uncovering the head in Gods service, Bowing the knee, and all outward signs of
Reverence, yea and all inward and invisible Acts of man in his will and
understanding. All these spiritual Acts are esteemed by him to be unproperly
called Sacrifices. But that all these kinds of Acts, so far forth as they
are exercised in the holy worship of God, are called Sacrifices by the Ancient
Fathers, can never be denied by any that ever was acquainted with their
Writings.

Now our Demonstration is this, that most of these Acts, which are here
confessed to be Improper Sacrifices, being used in the Celebration of the
Supper of our Lord, occasioned the Fathers to call the Eucharist it self a
Sacrifice; and therefore they meant thereby no Proper Sacrifice. As first (by
your own Cassand. Liturg. cap. 22. Ordo celebrandi Missam, secundum Romanos,
celebrante Pontifice, extractus ex variis libellis -- Ibid. cap. 27. Populus
dat Elcemosynas suas, i. e. panem and vinum, tam masculi quam foeminae. Ibid.
De veteri ritu oblationis panis and vini, I^en. lib. 4. cap. 32. Primitias
creaturarum offerentes -- Hanc oblationem Ecclesia sola pura offert
Fabricatori, offerens cum gratiarum action. Ibid. In expositione ordinis.
R^mani, exscriptis Greg. Papae. Oblationes fidelium fuisse tantum panem and
vinum -- Et Collectae in usum Pauperum, veltestitutionem Ecclesiarum, opportuno
tempore, non inter solennia Missarum, -- quae populi donaria, non certe
Sacrificia -- Sacrificium autem, ficut Isidorus, dictum quasi sacrum factum,
quia prece mystica consecratur. Cassand. ibid. Non ignoramus veteres Theologes
appellasse Eucharistiam Sacrificium laudis. Maldenas. lib. de 7. Sacram. Tom.
1. part. 3.. Praeter haec. page 322.
Confession) that the Fathers called The oblations of Bread and Wine, made by
the people, before Consecration, Sacrifices; the Alms, and Collections for the
poor Sacrifices; Our Praises and Thanksgiving to God (whereof the Eucharist
has it is name) Sacrifice: and that many other Circumstantiall Acts are called
Sacrifices, even the Sole Act of our Commemoration, as will appear in our last
Examination concerning the Doctrine of Protestants.

Our Eleventh Demonstration; because the Relatives of Sacrifice, which are
Altar and Priest, objected as properly taken, are used Improperly of Ancient
Fathers.

SECT. XV.
YOur Cardinal his Objection is this; that Priest, Altar, and Sacrifice are
Relatives, and have mutual and unseparable Dependence one of each other. So
he, and truly. But you ought to take with you a necessary Caution, observed by
the same Bellarm. -- Sunt Relata, ita ut Sacrificium proprie (...) sacerdotio
proprie dicto: and Sacrificio improprie dicto improprie dictum sacerdotium
respondeant. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2.. Quintum.
Cardinal, that An unproper Sacrifice cannot infer a proper Priesthood: nor
an unproper Priesthood a proper Sacrifice, etc. otherwise, your Jesuit can
tell you of a Maldonat. Ies. Serpens aeneus fuit Sacrificium commemorativum
futuri Sacrificii Christi, sed tamen non habuit altar. Lib. de 7. Sacram. Tom.
1. de Euch.. Quintum genus.
Sacrifice without an Altar, and your Abulens. in Ios. 22. Altar hoc non
fuerat ad Sacrificium offerendum. Quaest. 9.
Bishop can point you out an Altar without a Sacrifice. Now to take one of
these improperly, and the other properly, were as wild Sophistry, as from a
wooden leg to infer a Body of Flesh. Now what if we shall say of this point of
Appellations, that It was not so from the beginning? Hereunto we claim but
your own common Confessions, viz. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 17.. Neque.
-- Neque obstat quod Ministri Ecclesiastici non dicebantur Sacerdotes, aut
utebantur nominibus Templi, Sacrificii, Altaris, and similibus, quia tempore
Apostoloru^, vigebat Sacerdorium Judaicum, ideo abstinebant ab iisdem vocibus,
ne viderentur cosdem illos ritus innovare.
That the Apostles did willingly abstain from the words of Sacrifice, Priest,
and Altar. So your Cardinal, and Eodem modo Durantus de Ritibus, lib. (...)
cap. 1. number. 7.
Durantus, the great Advocates for your Roman Mass: whereby they have
condemned not only other your Romish Disputers, who See above, Chap. 3. Sect. 8.
have sought a proof of a proper Sacrifice in your Mass from the word Altar,
used by the Apostle Paul, Heb. 13. but also themselves, who from Saint Luke,
Act. 3. [(...)] See above, Chap. 2. Sect. 1.
concluded a proper Sacrifice. As if the Apostles had both abstained and not
abstained from the words of Priest and Sacrifice.

But the Apostles did indeed forbear such terms in their speeches, concerning
Christian worship, whereof these your forenamed Disputers can give us a Reason,
See the former Testimony at (d.)
Least that (say they) the Jewish Priesthood being as yet in force, Christians
might seem, by using Jewish Terms, to innovate Jewish rites. Which is enough
to show, you are persuaded they abstained from the use of these words for some
reason. Yet that this could not be the Reason, you may be sufficiently
instructed in the word, Baptism, this being as fully Jewish, as was either the
word Priest, Altar, or Temple: and yet used of the Apostle without danger of
Innovation of Jewish manner of Baptismes: yea, and if the Apostles had thought
the Altar, Priest, Sacrifices, to be essential parts of Christian Religion,
they neither would nor ought to have concealed the words and names, least
thereby they might have seemed to have abhorred the proper Characters of our
Christian Profession.

We descend to the Fathers. It is not unknown unto you, how the Fathers
delighted themselves, in all their Treatises, with Jewish Ceremonial Terms,
only by Allegorical allusions, as they did with the word Synagogue, applying
it to any Christian assembly; as Arc to the Church; Holocaust, to
Mortification; Levite, to Deacons* Incense, to Prayers and Praises; and the
word Pascha to the day of the Resurrection of Christ. But if any should say,
that these Fathers used any of these words in a proper signification, he should
wrong both the common sense of these Fathers, and his own Conscience. It were
superfluous to urge many Instances, where one will serve. The word Altar,
applied to the Table of the Lord (which anciently stood in the Eusebius. Hist.
lib. 10. cap. 4. Sanctuario hoc modo absoluto, Altarique tanquam Sancto
Sanctorum in medio Sanctuarii sito; ne a plebe eo possit accedi, cancellis ex
ligno fabrifactus circumclusit. Coccius Tom. 2. Tract. de Altari, in vita
Antonii. Altar a multitudine circumdatum. Chrysostom. de visione Angelorum, lib.
6. de Sacerdotio. -- (...) and D^oxys. Hierarch. Eccles. cap. 3. (...). [These
Testimonies verify the same Assertion of Dt. Fulke against Greg. Martin, cap.
17. The Table stood so, that men might stand round about it.]
Midst of the Chancell, so that they might compass it round) was far more
rarely called (...) of the Greeks, or Altar of the Latins, than (...), and
Mensa, that is, Table; which they would not have done, if Altar had carried in
it the true and absolute property of an Altar: no, but they used therein the
like liberty, as they used to do in Aug. quast. super Exodus lib. 2. cap. 9.
Altar est populus Dei. Lib. 1. de Sermon. in money. Altar in interiore Dei
templo, i. e. fides. Lib. 10. de Civitat. Dei, cap. 4. Ejus est Altar cor
nostrum. And other Fathers ordinarily.
applying the name Altar to Gods people, and to a Christian man's Faith and
Heart.

Will you suffer us to come home to you? The Father Gregory Nazianzen, for his
soundness of Judgment surnamed the Divine, comparing this Inferior Altar,
and Sacrifice on earth, with the Body of Christ seated in Heaven, says that
the Sacrifices, which he offers in his Contemplation at the Altar in Heaven,
are Nazian. Orat. 28. -- Esto, ego pellor ab Altari in Ecclesia: at novi aliud
Altar mentis and contemplationis in coelo, ibi adstabo, and Deo offerani
Sacrificia, quae sunt tanto acceptiora, quam ea quae offerimus ad Altar,
quanto pretiosior est veritas quam umbra.
More acceptable than the Sacrifices, which are offered at the Altar below, as
much as Truth is more excellent than the Shadow. So he. Therefore (say we) the
Sacrifice of Christ his Body and Blood are subjectively in Heaven, but
objectively here in the Eucharist; here Representative only, as in a shadow,
but in Heaven presentatively, in his bodily presence. So vainly your Disputers
hitherto (whilst that we required Materials) have objected against us bare
words, phrases, and very shadows.

Lastly, Cyril of Alexandria Cyril Alex. cont. Julian. lib. 9. (Julian. Ob.)
Judaei sacrificant, -- vos autem invento novo Sacrificio -- quare non
sacrificatis? -- illud commune nobiscum habent, etiam Templa, Altaria, etc.
(Resp. Cyril. multo post.) Vitae honestas, and ad meliora propensio est
Sacrificium fragrantissimum -- Et Paulus hortatur nos exhibere corpora nostra
Sacrificium sanctum, rationalem cultum nostrum Deo. -- Igitur etsi Judaei
sacrificarent, ut in umbris praecepta implerent, nos tamen lara via cuntes, ad
id quod rectum est veniemus, nempe spiritualem and immortalem cultum
proficientes. (Julian.) Mosi dicitur, septem diebus azymis vescemini: vobis
parum est abstulisse. (Cyril. Resp.) Impletur Lex a nobis in Azymis, maxim
fide justificatis in Spiritu, mentalemque cultum praeponentibus tali modo. --
Unde scribit. D. Paulus, ut diem agamus in Azymis synceritatis and veritatis.
(Rursus Julian. ibid. lib. 10.) Offerre Sacra in Altari, and sacrificare
cavetis. (Resp. Cyril.) Adnibemus Sacrificia spiritualia, sc. and mentalia: nam
illi ex sanguine offerebant boves, and oves, -- Et ex fructibus similam, eleas,
etc. nos tamen tam crasso ministerio relicto tenue and subtle, at spirituale
perficimus: offerimus enim in odorem suavitatis fidem, spem, charitatem,
justitiam, lauds. Sacrificium enim secundum naturam incorporeum decet Deum.
(Julian.) Et Cain obtulit Sacrificium de fructibus terrae: Abel de carnalibus.
(Cyril. Resp.) Offerimus mel(...)oddam quam illi -- Sacrificamus enim
mentaliter and spiritualiter virtutum fragrantias. (R^^sus Julian. Ob.) Non
circumcidimini, non Azyma, non Pascha servatis. Non possumus, inquiunt, (viz.
Christiani:) pro nobis enim sen el immolatus est Christus, and prohibuit Azyma
-- non Abraham imitantes Altaria erigitis Deo, nec sacrificatoria aedificatis.
(Resp. Cyrill.) Circumcisionem habemus Spiritus -- In Azymis spiritualia quae
habemus. (Et ad Pascha Resp.) Affulsit veritas, Immolatus est pro nobis
Christus Agnus verus.
made an Answer to the Objections then published by Julian the Apostate against
the Truth of Christian Religion. By this conflict between these two wits, as
it were by the clashing of a Stone and Steel together, such a flash of
lightning will appear, as may sufficiently illuminate every Reader, for the
understanding of the judgment of Antiquity thorowout the whole Clause;
concerning Bodily Sacrifice.

The Apostate objecteth (See the Margent) as an exception against Christians
that they are not Circumcised* that they use no Azymes, nor keep the Passover
of the Jews: albeit, Gain, Abel, and Abraham before the Law, and the
Israelites under the Law, and Heathenish Grecians, always without that Law,
offered Sacrifices unto God. But they (says Julian, writing of Christians)
erect no Altars unto God, offer no such Sacrifices as were of old, nor invent
any new, but say that Christ was once offered for them. This Objection (you
see) is pertinent to our Cause in hand, and as consonant will the Answer of the
holy Patriarch Cyril be; who to the other points held it Satisfaction enough to
say (see again the Marginals) That we Christians have the spiritual
Circumcision of the heart: That we observe the Spiritual Azymes of Syncerity
and Truth: And as for the Passover, Christ our Passover was offered up,
namely upon the Cross (for so is it answerable to the words objected by
Julian.) And to the Objection of not erecting Altars, Cyril says not a word.

But what for the point of Sacrifice? Hearken (we pray you) Although (says he)
the Jews Sacrificed to fulfill God's precepts in shadows, yet we doing that
which is right, (meaning the Truth opposite to Shadows) perform a spiritual,
and mental worship, as namely, Honesty, and an holy Conversation. And again,
The Jews offered in Sacrifice Bulls and Sheep, first fruits of the Earth,
Cakes, and Frankincense: but we offer that which is spiritual, to wit, Faith,
Hope, Charity, and Praises; because an unbodily Sacrifice is fit for God. And
yet again, We Sacrifice to God spiritually, and mentally, the perfumes of
virtues. This is the Sum of Saint Cyril his Answer, void of all mention of
any Offering of the Body of Christ, as either Corporally present in the
Eucharist to be Sacrificed by the Priest, or yet of any Corporal Touch thereof
(by eating) with the Bodies of Communicants; no nor any intimation of any
Proper Sacrifice professed by Christians.

Here will be no place for your Answer, to tell us that the Question was of
Bloody, and not of Unbloody Sacrifices: No, for Cyril in his Answer handles as
well the unbloody Sacrifice of Cain, as the bloody Oblation of Abel; and
expresses as fully the unbloody Sacrifice of Cakes and Frankincense, as he
does the Bloody of Sheep, and Oxen.

Nevertheless, we should confute our selves, by objecting this Testimony,
seeing that the Custom of the Primitive Church being then professedly not to
reveal the Mystery of the Sacrament of Baptism, or of the Eucharist, either
to Infidels or Catechumenists, and therefore this silence of Cyril, in not so
much as mentioning the Sacrifice of the Mass, might seem to have been
purposely done, to conceal it from both Julian, the Patron of Heathenish
worship, and all Infidels: So indeed we should have thought, but that then
Julian and Cyril both would as readily confute us; Julian, because he himself
had been more than a Catechumenist in the Church of Christ, even (as namely
Gregory Nazienzene witnesses) once Greg. Nazian. Orat. 3. advers. Julian. (De
Gallo and Iulian^.) Quinetiam in Clerum seipsos ascripserunt, ut divinos quoque

A Reader of Scriptures to the people, not thinking it any Derogation unto him
so to do; therefore was he not ignorant of the then Christian Doctrine,
concerning the Eucharist. And (which is a point as observable) when he
objecteth against Christians want of Sacrifices, by and by, as if Christians
had nothing to say for themselves, but that Christ gave up himself once; he
expresses this their Answer, as that which he held not to be sufficient. And
Cyril also would control us, who in his whole Answer (opposing Spiritual to
Corporal) defends no Sacrifice at all among Christians, but that which he
calls Spiritual and mental; as for example, Godly Conversation, Faith,
Hope, Charity, Praises, etc. All which are S^ hereafter, Chap. 4. Sect. 3.
excluded out of your Definition of Proper Sacrifice.

The Case then is plain. If that the now Romish Doctrine of a Proper Bodily
Sacrifice of Christ's Body, offered up in the hands of the Priest, by an
Elevation, and after in Consummating the same by eating it with his mouth,
which you call a Sacrificing Act, had been Catholic learning in that Age,
then assuredly could neither Julian have challenged Christians for no
Sacrifice, nor Cyril have defended them, by confessing indeed no Sacrifice
among Christians, but only Spiritual and Mental.

CHAP. VI.
Our third Examination, which concerns your Profession of the Romish Mass,
by your Romish Principles.

The State of the Question.

WELL have you discerned of the twofold acception of a Proper Sacrifice, which
(as Bellarm. Sacrificium Missae accipitur proprie pro re, quae sacrificatur:
and etiam accipitur proprie pro action sacrificandi. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap.
27.. Resp. ut.
you say) Is sometime taken for the thing sacrificed, and also for the proper
sacrificing Act. So your Cardinal: and indeed, both these are necessary in a
proper Sacrifice, yet neither of these can possibly be found in your pretended
Sacrifice of your Romish Mass.

That the Thing, pretended to be Sacrificed, is not properly in the Roman
Mass.

SECT. I.
THe things, which your Romish Belief professes to be Sacrificed in your
Mass, is the Body and Blood of Christ, corporally extant therein, as the
proper Subject thereof. But that there is no Corporal existence of Christ's
Body in the Eucharist, was the Conclusion of our second, third, and fourth
Books. And that the same Body and Blood of Christ is not the proper subject
matter of the Sacrifice, used in your Mass, is our Conclusion through out this
whole Book. Of both which you may have a Synopsis and general view in the
last Book. Thus of the thing Sacrificed, now that which follows, concerning
your Romish Sacrificing Act, is a point briefly expedited by two Propositions.

I. That no Act now used in the Roman Mass can truly be called a proper
Sacrificing Act: proved by your own Principles.

SECT. II.
WHatsoever Sacrificing Act your Advocates have held, as Proper to a Sacrifice;
and assumed, as belonging to the Sacrifice of your Mass, have each one been
See above, Chap. 1. Sect. 5.
Confuted by Doctors of your own Church, of singular estimation; and rejected,
as utterly insufficient to prove any proper Sacrificing Act in the Institution
of Christ: to wit, not Elevation, not Fraction, not Oblation, not Consecration,
and lastly, not Consumption of the Eucharist by the mouth of the Priest: Non
licet actum agere, said one, and Non libet, say we. But now are we to discuss
such Properties as are yet awanting in your Romish Execution.

II. That that which is properly a Sacrificing Act, is wanting in the Roman
Mass; proved by your own Principles.

SECT. III.
THree properties are required of you, as necessary to a properly Sacrificing
Act, the first is, that the Action be exercised upon a thing Conc. Trid.
Christus tradebat visibile Sacramentum sub specie panis and vini. Sess. 22. and
Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27.. Secundo.
Visible. Secondly, that the thing sacrificed be of Septimo, ritu mystico
consecratur: nam debet res illa, quae Deo offertur, ex profana fieri sacra.
Idem significat Sacrificare, quod sacrum facere. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa,
cap. 2.
Profane, made sacred by the Act of Consecration. Thirdly, that the Act be a
Bellarm. Octavo, transmutatur, quid ad verum Sacrificium requiritur, ut id,
quod offertur Deo, plane destruatur, i. e. it^ mutetur, ut desinat esse id qod
ante erat, In quo differt a simplici oblatione, quae interdum mystico ritu
elevabatur coram Deo, sed non destruebatur, nisi quando vere sacrificabatur.
Ratio duplex, 1. ^b significationem mortis Christi. 2. ad protestationem
subjectionis nostrae coram Deo -- Ideo requiritur, ut non solum usus, sed etiam
substantia consumatur. -- Sacrificium requirit Consumptionem. Pater, (...), est
a (...), mactare. Matthew. 22. Altilia di^unt (...) occisa, (...), i. e.
Exhalario, in quo differt ab oblatione; Item (...) dicitur a (...), consumo.
Probatur ex Scriptura, ubi omnia Sacrificia destruenda erant, si viventia, per
occisionem; si inanimata solida, per combustionem; si liquida, per effusionem.
Ex inanimis solidis per immolationes, sic dictas a mola, vel molendo, quamvis
vox, Immolare, pro sacrificare sumatur. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. per totum. Et
idem ibid. cap. 4.. Nunc.
Destructive Act, whereby the thing offered be truly destroyed, and cease to be
in substance that which it was. According to your own objected words, (...),
and (...), signifying a Consumption; and therein answerable to the Sacrifices
of the old Law, all which suffered Destruction; things living by slaughter,
things without life, if solid, by burning; if liquid, by pouring out, and
shedding, etc. So you in Thesi, we descend to the Hypothesis.

But before we enter into this Disquisition, we shall desire you to take unto
you the spirits of reasonable men, whilst we reason the matter with you in few
words. First, it cannot be called Properly Visible, which is not Visible in it
self. But the Body of Christ, which you call the thing sacrificed, is not
Visible in it self, but only (as your Council of Conc. Trid. and Bellarm.
above cited,. 3. at a.
Trent has taught) In the form of Bread; and then, how invisible it is, only
blind men can be ignorant. Nor will we think All, among you, to be so blind,
seeing that we hear one (and that a Jesuit) acknowledging his eyesight, and
plainly, without Parables, saying, that Salmeron. Christus cruentus, and
incruentus, non differunt, sed quod ille visibilis, hic invisibilis. Tom. 9.
Tract. 29.. Jam do.
Christ in the Eucharist is invisible. So he. Therefore the first Property of a
proper Sacrificing Subject is wanting in Roman Mass.

Secondly, we will not judge any of you so blasphemous, as to say, that the
Body of Christ, by your Consecration, is of a Profane thing made sacred, which
we are sure your Ancient Romish School did deny; which concluded that Aquinas.
Benedictio sacerdotalis fertur super terminum a quo, non super terminum ad
quem, i. e. super corpus Christi. In 1. Cor. 10.
It is not Christ that is made sacred, by benediction of the Priest, but that
which the Priest first takes in his hands to bless. And so your Act of
Consecration, by defect of the second property, is no proper Sacrificing Act of
the Body and Blood of Christ.

Thirdly, it will be as incredible in your own Judgments, that the Body of
Christ should be properly Destroyed. We say, in your own Judgments, who
therefore are constrained to say, Bellarm. Corpus Christi per consecrationem
accepit formam cibi, and ad comestionem and destructionem ordinatur: and licet
nullam laesionem patiatur in se, neque amittit suum esse natural sed amitrit
Sacramentale Esse, and proinde desinit esse realiter in altari, and definit
esse cibus sensibilis. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27.. Tertio.
That the Body of Christ indeed suffers not herein any natural Destruction,
but only Sacramental, that is, Metaphorical. Ergo, your Romish Mass is
destitute of the proper Sacrificing Act of Destruction. And again, whereas the
word Immolation is taken of Lombardus cum quaeritat quid Sacerdos gerit fit
dicendu^ Sacrificium aut Immolatio, accipit nomen. Immolationis pro occisione,
respondet autem ^ect^ssime, Christum sem^l tantum immolatum, i. e. occisum
suisse, non autem immolari, i. e. occidi in Sacramento and repraesentatione.
Rursus paulo sup^.. Ad hanc. Cruenta Immolatio semel tantum vere and proprie
facta est, nunc autem proprie, sed per Repraesentationem. Lib. 4. Did. 12..
Post haec.
Lombard for being Slain, or suffering by Death; It was most truly said by him
(says your Cardinal) that Christ is not immolated, meaning not slain, but
only in Representation.

Well then, the State of the Question, as your Cardinal himself has set it
down, is (seeing that every Proper Sacrifice requires a Proper Destruction,
and, if it be a living Sacrifice, a Destruction by death) Whether Christ be
properly Sacrificed, or no. Mark, we pray you, your Cardinal's Resolution. His
bloody Sacrifice was but once truly and properly done, but now it is properly
done but by Representation. O Vertigo! For, that which is but once only
properly offered, can never be said to be again properly offered; and that
which is a Bloody Oblation, by your own learning, cannot be Unbloody.

And as great an Intoxication is to be seen in your Disputers, in respect of
the other part of the Sacrament touching the Cup: For your Cardinal Alan
defends a Real Destruction in this manner; Alanus de Eucharist. lib. 2. cap.
13. In carn^s and sanguinis separatione (unde proprie in animalibus r^actatio)
consistit vis hujus mysterii, ut in eo solo cernatur divinae mortis
repraesentatio -- sequitur Christum esse praesentem modo immolatio -- quod
funditur in remissione peecatorum: e^go per modu^ Victimae praesens est, imo
Christus hic praesens induit eum modum, quem habuit ut se offerens in
Sacrificio Ciucis. (Aliquanto post haec) Propter concomitantiam de qua superius
diximus in seipso non moritur.
In creatures living (says he) the thing sacrificed must be slain, and in
this slaying by the separation of blood from the Body does consist all force
and virtue of this Mystery, because Christ is herein, after the manner of
Sacrifice, taking upon him the manner of Sacrificing, which he had in offering
himself upon the Cross, by separation of his Blood. So he. All which does
infer a Real and Proper separation and effusion of Blood; yet immediately
after stands he to the Defense of Concomitancy, which teaches an Union of
Body and Blood together, in as full a manner as it was in Christ his most
perfect estate. But Blood Separated, and United, are as (...) contrary as can
be. How much better would it beseem you to confess plainly and truly with
your Costerus, that Costerus Christian. In stitutionum, lib. 1. cap. 10.
Christus in cruce solus scipsum obtulit per veram sanguinis effusionem and
mortem: hic per Sacerdotem, tanquain ministrum, se offert sine Sanguinis
Effusione and morte, sed per utriusque repraesentationem.
Christ is not offered here with effusion of Blood, but by a representation
thereof.

CHALLENGE.
A Syllogism will quit the Business; as for Example. Every proper Sacrifice
is properly Visible, of Profane is made Sacred, and properly suffers
Destruction. (This is your own Proposition in each part.)

But the Body of Christ, in the Eucharist, is neither properly Visible, nor
properly of Profane made Sacred, nor suffers any proper Destruction. (This
is also your own Assumption.)

Therefore the Body of Christ, in this Sacrament, is not a proper Sacrifice,
nor properly Sacrificed. This (except men have lost their brains) must needs
be every man's Conclusion. And that so much the rather, because it cannot be
sufficient, that Christ's Body be present in the Eucharist, to make it a
Sacrifice, without some Sacrificing Act. A Sheep is no Sacrifice whilst it
remains in the fold, nor can every Action serve the turn, except it be a
destructive Act: for the Sheep does not become therefore a Sacrifice because
it is shorn, nor yet can any destructive Act be held Sacrificing, which is not
prescribed by Divine Authority; which only can ordain a Sacrifice, as has
been confessed. But no such divine ordinance has hitherto been proved.

Is it not then a miserable case which you are in, to suffer your selves to be
deceived by such Mountebankes, who pretend to direct men's Consciences in the
Mysteries of Christian Faith, and particularly concerning this high point of
Proper Sacrifice? and in the end give no other satisfaction than by mere
Riddles of a Visible, not Visible, Consecrated, not Consecrated, Destroyed, and
not Destroyed, with Blood separated, and not separated from the Body; and each
one spoken of the same Body of Christ. Our last point concerning a proper
Sacrifice follows.

CHAP. VII.
Our Fourth Examination is of the Doctrine of PROTESTANTS, in the point of
Sacrifice.

IN discussion whereof, we are to consider first the Acts, which are incident
unto the Celebration of this Sacrament: and then the Object thereof which is
the true and real Body of Christ, as it was Sacrificed upon the Cross. In
respect of the Acts we say,

I. That Spiritual Sacrifices, albeit Improper, are in one respect more true,
and do far excel all merely Corporal Sacrifices according to Scripture.

SECT. I.
WHen Christ called himself the True Vine, the True light, the True Bread; in
respect of the natural Vine, Light, and Bread; He taught us to distinguish
between a Truth of Excellency, and a Truth of propriety, by their different
Effects. That which has the natural property of Bread (although Manna)
preserves but the temporal life, for John 6.
They are Manna, and died: But the Bread of Excellency, which is Christ's Body,
preserves to Ibid.
Immortality. It is a good Observation, which your Canus has, that Canus.
Quia per Sacrificia legis externa res quaeda^ spirituales potiores
praefignabantur, has omnino res Sacrificia, holocausta, hostias sacrae literae
appellant: ut mactationes brutorum animalium figurae erant mortificationis.
Loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12.. In secundo.
Many spiritual things are called Sacrifices, in Scripture, because they were
prefigured by the outward bodily Sacrifices of the Lamb: as the killing of
Beasts were signs of mortification, which is a killing of sin. So he. And
the Thing prefigured (you know) is always held more excellent than the figure
thereof.

First, the Sacrifice of Contrition, Psalm. 51. 17. The Sacrifice of God is a
Contrite heart. Secondly, of Righteousness, by Mortification. Psalm. 4. 5.
Offer the Sacrifice of Righteousness. And Romans 12. 1. Present your Bodies a
living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
Service. Thirdly, the Sacrifice of Prayer and Praise, Hosea 14. 2. We will
render the Calves of our lips. Fourthly, of Almes-workes, Heb. 13. 16. With
such Sacrifices God is well pleased. Fifthly, Sacrifice of Preaching, Romans 15.
16. That I ministering the Gospel, that the offering up of the Gentiles might
be acceptable, being sanctified by the holy Ghost. Sixthly, the Sacrifice of
Martyrdom, Phil. 2. 17. Yea, and if I be offered up upon the Sacrifice and
Service of your faith, etc. Next we say.

II. That all these Spiritual Acts, although improperly called Sacrifices, yet
are they more excellent than all merely Corpoporall and proper Sacrifices; in
the Judgment of Ancient Fathers.

SECT. II.
Upon this Contemplation Ancient Fathers have breathed out many divine
Ejaculations, for the expressing of the excellent Prerogatives of Spiritual
Sacrifices, in respect of Corporal. Of the Sacrifice of Contrition, thus: Non
terrenis, sed spiritualibus est Deo litandum. Tertull. adversus Iud. eos.
Gods wrath is to be appeased with Spiritual Sacrifices. And Erant tum
Sacrificia pro delicto, quae nunc sunt Sacrificia poenitentiae de delicto.
Ambros. lib. 3. Epist. 28.
They were then Sacrifices for sin, which are now Sacrifices of Repentance
for sin. And Spiritus contribulatus. -- Ostendit Deus, se velle Sacrificium,
non trucidati pecoris, sed contriti pectoris. Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. 10. cap.
5.
God shows he will not have the Sacrifice of a slain beast, but of a
contrite breast. Of the Sacrifice of Righteousness thus, Mundo moriens, ipse
est Sacrificium. Idem.
He that dies to the world is for himself a Sacrifice. And Tunc corpora pro
corporibus; nunc non corpora, sed vitia corporis perimenda. Arnob. c^nt. Gen^es.
Then were creatures slain to cleanse men's bodies: but now are men to mortify
their vices: (...), etc. Isid. Pelus lib. 3. Epist. 75.
Every one being made a Priest over his own body, to overruled vices. And Illi
offerebant oves and boves: nos tam craffo praeteriro Sacrifici^ subtle
offerimus, virtutes omnigenas: Sacrificium enim minime carnale, secundum
naturam incorpoream, decet Deum. Ambros. [The same which he has translated
word for word out of Cyril. Alex. cont. Julian. See above, toward the end of
Chap. 5.]
They offered those gross bodies of sheep: but we the more subtle and pure
of virtues, because unbloody things best agree with God. And Chrys^st. in Genesis
Hom. 60. (...).
This is a new and admirable Sacrifice. And Pe^usiota. lib. 3. Epist. 75. (...).
The best Sacrifice is to have a pure mind, and a chaste Body.

Of the spiritual Sacrifice of Prayer and Praises unto God, thus; Praeces and
Gratiarum actiones factae Deo, (...). Justin. Dial. cum Tryphone Iudaeo. And
another upon that Psalm. 68. of David [Canticum laudis plus placet Deo quam
novella] observes in the Hebrew an elegant Allusion, as if it had been said,
Deomagis placet Schir, quam Schior, id est Canticum, quam vitulus. Bellarm.
ibid.
These are most perfect and only Sacrifices acceptable to God. Of Preaching
the word of God thus, Gladio verbi mactans vitia. Hieron. and rursus in Psalm.
26. Hostia jubilationis, hostia praedicationis.
We stay vices with the sword of the word. And of The Function Evangelicall,
Chrysostom. in Psalm. 95. Munus Evangelicum Sacrificium mundum and immaculatum.
It is a pure Sacrifice, and immaculate. And Sacrificium praedicationis omnibus
aromatibus praestantius. Aug.
A Sacrifice sweeter than all Spices. Of Almesworkes thus, (...) dicunt, vel
quod ea Deus prae Sacrificiis placere sibi testatur: haec sancta vestis aromata
Sanctorum est. Chrysostom.
These God testifies to be more pleasant unto him, than all the Sacrifices.
And Vbi scriptum est, [Misericordiam magis volo quam Sacrificium] nihil aliud
quam Sacrificium Sacrificio praelatum intelligi oportet: quoniam quod ab
hominibus appellatur Sacrificium, fignum est very Sacrificii. August. lib. 10.
de Civitat. cap. 5.
This is a true Sacrifice, whereof the other Sacrifices are but Signs. Of
Martyrdom thus, Nos templum Dei sumus omnes, cor nostrum akare Dei, cruentas
victimas ca dimus, quando usque ad sanguinem pro veritate certamus. August.
ibid. cap. 4.
We are God's Temple, our hearts his Altars: we then offer up our bloody
Sacrifice, when we contend for the truth with our blood. In brief, Verum
Sacrificium est omne opus quod agitur, ut Deo in sancta societate haereamus:
relatumque ad illum finem, ut beati esse possimus. Idem. lib. 10. de Civit.
cap. 6.
Every good work done, to the end that we may enjoy God, is a true Sacrifice.
Hitherto of our Proposition, by the Determination of holy Fathers: In the next
place we say, for the Assumption,

III. That Protestants profess in their Celebration diverse Sacrifices of
chief Excellency.

SECT. III.
Corporal and Spiritual Sacrifices are by you distinguished, calling the
first, Proper, and the other, Improper; but the spiritual excels by
infinite Degrees, as you have heard. In which kind, Protestants, in their
Celebration, profess four sorts of Sacrifices. For proof hereof, we may
instance in our Church of In the English Liturgy.
England, most happily reformed and established. First, the Sacrifice of
Mortification in Act, and of Martyrdom in Vow, saying, We offer unto thee, O
Lord, our selves, our souls, and bodies, to be an holy, lively, and reasonable
Sacrifice unto thee. Next, a Sacrifice Eucharisticall, saying, We desire thy
fatherly goodness mercifully to accept of our Sacrifice of Praise and
Thanksgiving. And why may we not, with the Scripture, call this a Sacrifice?
seeing that your Bishop Iansenius held it for an Argument of proving Christ to
have offered a Sacrifice, even Iansen. Christum in coena Sacrificium obtulisse,
primum quidem satis est significatum, cum dicitur Gratias egisse: Gratiarum
enim actio est quoddam Sacrificiu^, a qua Christi action Sacramentum corporis
and sanguinis Domini nomen illud ab initio Ecclesia accepit. Con^ord. cap. 131.
Because he gave Thanks: giving of Thanks being a kind of Sacrifice. So he.
Thirdly, a Sacrifice Latreuticall, that is, of Divine worship, saying, And
although we be unworthy to offer up any Sacrifice, yet we beseech thee to
accept of our bounden duty and service, etc. This performance of our Bounden
Service is that which See above, Chap. 3. Sect. 5.
Ancient Fathers called an Unbloody Sacrifice.

Nor is our Church of England alone in this Profession. This Truth we refer
unto the Report of your Bellarm. Melancthon Eucharistiam Sacrificium esse vult,
-- and Calvinus non solum (...) esse vult, sed etiam (...) and (...). Lib. 1.
de Missa, cap. 2.. Ac primum, and Expendamus.
Cardinal, and of Canus. Lutherani in Apologia Augustana perperam Sacrificium
definiebant esse opus a nobis Deo redditum, ut eum honor afficiamus. Loc.
Theolog. lib. 12. cap. 12.. Quibus rebus. Bell larm. Melancthon, dicit, Missam
dici posse Sacrificium, quatenus sumptio Eucharistiae fieri potest ad laudem
Dei, sicut coetera bona opera. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2.. Ac primum. Et
Calvinus dicit, Sacrificium generaliter acceptum complectitur quicquid Deo
offertur. Ibid.. Expendamus. Kemnitius dicit, Sacrificium a Patribus dici
Oblationem, Immolationem, and Sacrificium, quia est commemoratio and
repraesentatio very Sacrifici^ Christi. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 15.. Aker modus.
Canus, by whom you may understand the agreement between them, whom you name
Lutherans, in their Augustane Confession, and of Calvin; by acknowledging not
some one Act, but the whole work of this Celebration (according to the
Institution of Christ) both in Communication, Commemoration, and Representation
of his Death, with Praise and Thanksgiving, to be a Sacrifice Eucharisticall:
And also (to use the words of Calvin) Latreuticall, and Sebasticall, that is, a
Sacrifice of Worship and Veneration, which every Christian may and must
profess, who has either eyes in his head, or faith in his heart: the
Celebration of this Sacrament, in Remembrance of his absolute Sacrifice of our
Redemption, being the Service of all Services that we can perform to God. Now
wherein, and in what respect we may furthermore be said to offer to God a
Sacrifice propitiatory, improperly, will after appear when we consider
Christ's Body as the Object herein.

That Protestants in their Commemoration offer up the same Body and Blood of
Christ, which was Sacrificed on the Cross, as the Object of Remembrance, and
most absolute Sacrifice of our Redemption.

SECT. IV.
NOw we are come to the last, most true, and necessary point: which is the Body
and Blood, as the Object of our Commemoration. Still, still do you urge the
saying of Fathers, where they affirm that we offer unto God The same Body and
Blood of Christ, on this Altar, even the same which was sacrificed on the
Cross; which therefore you interpret as being the same subject matter of our
Commemoration, As is a King acting himself upon a Stage, as has been See
above, Chap. 5. Sect. 7.
shown.

We as instantly, and more truly, proclaim that we offer (Commemoratively) the
same, undoubtedly the very same Body and Blood of Christ his All sufficient
Sacrifice on the Cross, although not as the subject of his proper Sacrifice,
but yet as the only adequate Object of our Commemoration; as when the same
murder of the Emperor Mauritius is represented in a Stage Play in some manner
of Resemblance: wherein we cannot possibly err, having Truth it self for our
Guide, who said, Do this in remembrance of me, namely, of the same [Mee]
meaning Christ as crucified on the Cross, as the Apostle commenteth, saying,
Hereby you show the Lords Death till he come, even the Same Body, as the Same
Death; whereunto bear all the Fathers witness, thorowout this Treatise.
Whereby it will be easy for us to discern the subject Sacrifice of Christ
from ours, his being the Real Sacrifice on the Cross, ours only the
Sacramental Representation, Commemoration, and Application thereof.

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Second Principal part of this Controversy, which concerns the
Romish Sacrifice, is as it is called Properly Propitiatory.

THis part is divided into an 1. Explication of that which you call
Propitiatory. 2. Application thereof, for Remission of Sins.

The State of the Question of Propitiatory, what it is.

SECT. I.
THe whole Difference stands upon this, whether the subject matter of our
Representation in the hands of the Priest be properly a Propitiatory Sacrifice,
or no. Now Propitiatory is either that which pacifieth the wrath of God, and
pleases him by it is own virtue and efficacy, which (as all confess) is only
the Sacrifice of Christ in his own self; or else a thing is said to be
Propitiatory and pleasing to God, by God's gracious acceptance and indulgence.
The Romish profess the Sacrifice of their Mass to be such, in the proper
Virtue of that which the Priest handles. For the Tridentine faith, concerning
your Propitiatory Sacrifice, is this, viz. Synod. Trident. Sacrificium vere
propitiatorium -- Hujus oblatione placatur Deus, gratiam and donu^ poenitentiae
concedens dimittit peccata, una enim eademque hostia est, idem nam offerens
Sacerdotum ministerio, qui seipsum in cruce obtulit. Sess. 22. cap. 2.
It is that whereby God being pacified does pardon sins.

And least that there might be any ambiguity, how it does pacify God, whether
by his gracious Acceptance, or the Efficacy of offering, your general Roman
Catechism authorized both by your Council of Trent, and the then Pope Pius
the fourth, for the direction of your whole Church, instructs you all,
concerning your Sacrifice of the Mass, that Catechis. Romans (jussu C^ns.
Trident. and Pii Quarti Pont. editus.) Vt Sacrificium est, non solum merendi,
sed and satisfaciendi quoque efficaciam habet. De Luth. number. 55. Osorius Ies.
Conc. Tom. 4. de Missae Sacrificio in Psalm. 4. [Sacrificate Sacrificium.]
Vnicum hoc Sacrificium est Sacrificium laudis, gratiarum actionis, expiatoriu^
and satisfactorium pro peccatis, and impetratorium pro vivis and defunctis. Ita
tradit Conc. Tri^.
As it is a Sacrifice, it has an Efficacy and Virtue, not only of merit, but
also of satisfaction. So they, as truly setting down the true nature of a
Propitiatory Sacrifice, as they do falsely assume and apply it unto the
Sacrifice of your Mass; which Protestants abhor and impugn as a Doctrine most
Sacrilegious; and only grant the Celebration to be Propitiatory (Improperly) by
God's Complacency and favorable acceptance, wherewith he vouchsafes to admit
of the holy Actions and Affections of his faithful.

Trial of all this is to be made by Scriptures, Fathers, by your own Romish
Principles, and by the Doctrine of Protestants. In the Interim, be it known
that our Church of England, in her 31. Article, faith of your Propitiatory
Sacrifice of the Mass, as it is taught by you, that it is A Blasphemous Fable,
and Dangerous Deceit.

That the Romish Propitiatory Sacrifice has no foundation in the Institution
of Christ.

SECT. II.
YOur only Objection is, that Christ, in the words of his first Institution,
said, Take, this is the new Testament in my Blood, shed for you and for many,
for the Remission of sins. Hear your Cardinal, Bellarm. Secundum Argumentum
sumitur ex his verbis Institutionis, quae apertissime docent Christum obtulisse
in coena pro peccatis Apostolorum. Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 2.. Secundum.
These words do most evidently teach, that Christ now in his Supper offered up
his Blood for the sins of his Apostles. So he. But if this his Exposition of
Christ's words be most evident, alas! what a number of other blind Guides, of
great estimation among you, has your Church favored, pampered, privileged,
and authorized, who could see nothing in the words of Christ, but the flat
contrary? (namely) that they were spoken in the Present Tense (Tropically) for
the future, not that it was then shed, but that it was to be shed on the Cross
immediately after; among whom have See above, Chap. 1. Sect. 2.
been reckoned Gregory de Valentia, Salmeron, Barradas, three prime Jesuits,
your Bishop Iansenius, yea and the Author of your Vulgar Translation.

And that you may the better discern, how hard the foreheads of your
Cardinal, of your Rhemists, of Mr. Breerley, and of such others are, who have
made that Objection, you have been likewise advertized, that in the very tenor
of your own Romish Mass it self, the word is expressly [ In the forecited
place.
Effundetur] It shall be shed: We say in the Tenor of your Romish Mass,
published by the Authority of Pope Pius the fifth, repeated by every one of
your selves (you being Romish Priests) and accordingly believed of all the
Professors of your Romish Religion. Which Interpretation was furthermore
confirmed by See above, Chap. 1. Sect. 3.
Fathers, and by Scripture (in the places objected) and by a Reason taken from
your own Confession, granting that Christ his Blood was not really shed in his
last Supper. This is that which we had to oppose unto that your Cardinal's Most
evident Argument, as Sunshine to Moone-light.

That many things are said to pacify and please God, which are not properly
Propitiatory, by their own Virtue, according to Scriptures and your own
Confessions.

SECT. III.
IN Scripture, our Mortification of the flesh is called a Sacrifice
well-pleasing to God. Romans 12. 1. Alms, Works of Charity, are likewise called
Sacrifices, wherewith God is delighted, Heb. 13. 16. Comforting, and cherishing
the Ministers of God, is called A Sacrifice acceptable, and well pleasing to
God, Phil. 4. 18. So the Scripture.

And that Spiritual Sacrifices are more pleasing unto God, than all the
Hecatombs of Corporals could be, is a Confession, which we will take from the
quill of Valentia the Jesuit, saying that Valent. Omne's actiones (...) recte
propi^ Deum aliqua ratione censeri debent. Lib. 2. de Miss^, cap. 5. Ide^m. Pe^
ratione Precibus propi^ vis in Scriptura tribuitur, quaterius beneficia divina
ex misericor^ Dei, per illas impetra^^us. Ibid.
All right and just Actions may be said, in some sort, to be Propitiatory, and
to pacify God. As likewise of Prayer; Scripture (says he) attributes a
Propitiatory force unto Prayers, so far forth as we obtain many Blessings of
God, through his mercy, by them. So he. Which confirms our former Distinction
of Propitiatory, by the merciful Acceptance of God, distinct from your
Propitiatory, which is of meritorious Satisfaction by its own virtue: which
mere man must let alone for ever. Thus of our Examination from Scripture.

The Doctrine of Ancient Fathers, concerning a Propitiatory Sacrifice.

SECT. IV.
ALbeit our Premises in the former part of this Controversy touching
Sacrifice, and proving both by Scripture and ancient Fathers, that the
Eucharist is not properly a Sacrifice, might give a Supersedeas to all your
further contending by their Authority, for Defense of a Sacrifice properly
propitiatory; because that which is not properly a Sacrifice, can no more be a
Sacrifice properly Propitiatory, than that which is not properly a stone can be
properly called a Mil-stone: Notwithstanding, we would be loath to be indebted
unto you for an Answer to your objected Fathers, in this point also. The
Objections, which you use and urge, are of two kinds: some, wherein there is no
mention of the Body and Blood of Christ at all; and the other sort such,
wherein they both are named and expressed.

CHAP. IX.
That the objected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers might well be understood to
call the Celebration of the Eucharist A Propitiatory Sacrifice, in respect of
diverse Spiritual Acts therein, without any Conceit of a Proper Virtue of
Propititiation it self.

SECT. I.
A Propitiatory in God's merciful acceptance we defend, but not in Equivalency
of valor and Virtue in it self. First, as it is an Act commanded by Christ,
in which sense your Jesuit See above, Chap. 8. Sect. 3.
Valentia says, that Every right Act is in a sort Propitiatory. Secondly, as
it is a godly Act, whereby we do affiance our soul August. See above, Chap.
5. Sect. 2.
to God, Every good work, which is done that we may adhere unto Chrysostom. Ibid.
God, is a True Sacrifice. Thirdly, as it is an Act serving peculiarly to Gods
worship, for Religiousnesse is that (said Chrysostom) wherewith God testifies
himself to be well pleased. Fourthly, as it is an Act of Commemoration and
Representation of that only properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ upon the
Cross, we must grant to your Cardinal, that Commemoration alone has not any
Propitious Efficacy in it self: But yet by the Propitiatory Sacrifice of
Christ, resembled thereby, God vouchsafes to be Propitious unto us; in which
respect Origin. in Levit. Him. 13. Siredeas ad illum que^^ Deus proposuit
Propitiatorem per fidem, and fi respicias ad illam commemorationem, de qua
dicit Dominus, Hoc facite in commemorationem mei; ista est sola commemoratio,
quae propitium facit hominibus Deum.
Origin exhorting Christians to resort unto Christ, whom God has made a
Propitiation through faith in his blood, and also to reflect upon the
Commemoration which was commanded by Christ, saying, Doc this in remembrance of
me: This (says Origin) is the only Commemoration which makes God propitious.

If any would say, how then shall we not make Commemoration to be Propitiatory
in it self? We answer, as a man holding in his hand a precious Jewel, which
is enclosed in a Ring of gold, and putting it on his finger to preserve him
from a Convulsion, the Preservative Virtue is not attributed to the Ring, but
to the Jewel; and yet we say, the Ring is the only means to us, which makes
the finger capable of that Virtue. So say we, Christ his own Sacrifice, which
was the only precious subject matter of our Redemption, is made now, by our
Remembering, the Object of our Commemoration, and Application of it, for our
Remission and Justification.

Nor is Origin alone in this, but all they (who were See Cha. 5. Sect. 11.
many) whom you have heard saying that Christ's Death and Passion, yea his
Bloody Body is offered herein. Your own Jesuit Salmeron is witness unto us
(for the Council of Ephesus, Eusebius, and Saint Augustine) that Salmeron.
Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 31. 9. Postremo supe^est. page 238. Quidam Patres judicant
inprimis hac hostia expiari peccata, quod cruentum memoret Sacrificiu^. Hanc
dicendi rationem sequitur Council. Ephesians. in Ep. ad Nestorem. Eusebius. in Demonst.
Evang. lib. 1. cap. 10. August. in Psalm. 75.
They declared us to have expiation of our sins by this Sacrifice, because the
bloody Sacrifice of Christ is remembered and commemorated herein.

That we say nothing of our Supplications and Prayers, by which through the
same Virtue of Christ's Propitiation, we obtain pardon and Remission of sins
(whether for Quick and Dead, belongs not to this Dispute, because whether so
or so, they are but Supplications still) together with many other saying
Blessings from God. Nor of the Act of Thanksgiving, (from which this Sacrament
is called the Eucharist) because this is the destinate end of our Celebration,
and therefore of all our spiritual Sacrifices most acceptable unto God, for
which cause See above, Chap. 8. Sect. 2.
Iustine Martyr called it, by the way of Excellency, (...), that is, The only
grateful Sacrifices. Lastly, in respect of our Application it self, whereof
in the next Section.

That the Ancient Fathers called it a Propitiatory Sacrifice Objectively, for
the Application of the Properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Cross, made of
the faithful in Celebration of the Memory thereof.

SECT. II.
WHen it was asked why the Ancient Fathers called Baptism a Sacrifice, it was
answered, See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 13. at the letter (c).
Because the Sacrifice of Christ's Death was applied unto us thereby. Yet that
Death, truly and only properly propitious, is but only objectively offered in
Baptism. The same may be said of the Eucharist, whereof your own great
Schoole-man, and Bishop Canus. Satis est ut vere and proprie sit Sacrificium,
quod mors Christi ita nunc ad peccati remissionem applicetur, ac si nunc ipse
Christus moreretur, id quod Scriptorum veterum testimoniis confirmatur. --
August. Semel immolatus in seipso Christus, and tamen quotidie immolatur in
Sacramento. Paschatius: Quotidie Christus mystice pro nobis immolatur, and
passio ejus in mysterio traditur. Et Cyrillus in Conc. Ephesians. Athanas. ad
Antioch. Theophyl. in Hebr. cap. 10. Greg. demum Nazian. (ut coeteros omittam)
hanc incruentam Immolati^ne^ vocant. L^c. theol. lib. 12. cap. 12.. Illud. page
422.
Canus says, that It is sufficient that the Eucharist be called a proper and
true Sacrifice, because the Death of Christ is applied thereby, as if he were
now dead. Mark, As if he were now dead, which can be but Objectively only, and
which (as you all know) is not your Priestly Sacrifice.

As for the Ancient Fathers, who in their objected Testimonies talked of Christ
Cyrill. Mys^ag. 5. Christum mactatum offerimus, ut Deum propitium reddamus. Ob.
per Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 2. Greg. Nyssen. orat. 1. de Resur. and
Theophyl. in Matthew. Dicunt mactationem esse in hac oblatione, etc.
Suffering, being slain, and dying in the Eucharist; We Protestants subscribe
to their Judgments with a full faith, in acknowledgement that Christ's Death,
the proper work of our Propitiation, is the only Object of our Remembrance and
faith: which sayings of the Fathers (says your Salmeron. Quod benign
interpretandum -- nimirum, mactationem antiquam Christi in cruce inveniri, non
novam and realem ab e^ distinctam. Si in coena mactatus erat, quomodo ad nonam
horam diei usque sequentis vixit? absurda haec sunt, and aliena a veritate.
Tom. 9. Tract. 31.. Quarto.
Jesuit) must be understood Sacramentally, to signify the real slaughter of
Christ offered by him upon the Cross. So he. Which again proves our
Conclusion, that they understood a Propitiatory Sacrifice only Objectively in
the Eucharist. We will end with the objected Testimony of Ambrose, thus,
Ambros. Hic imago, veritas in coelestibus, nunc Christus offertur, sed offertur
quasi homo, quasi recipiens passionem. O^fert se ipse, quasi Sacerdos, ut
peccata nostra dimittat, hic in imagine, ibi in veritate ubi apud Patrem. Lib.
1. de offic. cap. 48.
Here is an Image offered [Quasi, that is] as it were a man, as it were
suffering a Passion, offering himself as it were a Priest, that he may forgive
our sins. And of his now being See above, Chap. 3. Sect. 8. at the letter (c).
elsewhere he says, The truth is in Heaven, there is He in truth with the
Father. So he. Whereby is confuted your Conclusion of a Subjective Body of
Christ present herein, from [Quasi homo offertur:] for this any one may
perceive to be but a Quasi Argument for a Corporal presence, and to make fully
for our Distinction and Defense thereby. Enough of the Judgment of Antiquity.
Our third Examination follows.

CHAP. X.
Of the pretended Romish Propitiatory Sacrifice, confuted by Romish Principles,
as destitute of four Properties of Propitiation.

THE first is the Imperfection of the Sacrificer. The next, the no- proper
Destruction of the thing sacrificed. The third, the Vnbloodinesse of the same.
And the last, the but- finite Virtue and value, which you attribute unto it.

I. Confutation, from the confessed Imperfection of the Sacrifice.

SECT. I.
FIrst the Reason, why you account your Propitiatory Sacrifice to be but of
finite Virtue, is Bellar. Ratio 2. quare Sacri^ciu^ Crucis sit tanti valoris,
hoc autem finiti, sumitur ex part offerentis: nam Sacrificio Crucis ipse
offerens est filius Dei per se; at in Sacrificio Miss^ est ipse offerens per
Ministrum -- Illa actio immediate producta a divino supposito, ipsa ab humano.
Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 4.
Because it is not immediately offered up by Christ himself, as that was of the
Cross; but by his Minister. And the Reason of this, you say, is, Salmeron.
Ies. Modo Christus in Eucharistia persona^ induit re^ oblatae: and quamvis
Christus offerat per Sacerdotes, ut Administros ejus, tamen virtus and causa
universalis pro ratione causae secundariae operatur. Sacerdos igitur ejus
nomine induit personam offerentis. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. page 266. de Missis
privatis.
Because the Universal Cause works according to the limitation of the second
Causes. So you. Understanding, by Sacrifice, not the Object of your
Remembrance, which is the Body of Christ, as crucified; but the subject matter,
in the hand of the Priest. From whence this Consequence must issue, whether you
will or no, (namely) that Perfection of the Sacrifice being a necessary
property of a true Propitiatory Virtue and efficacy in prevailing with God for
man, it is impossible for any of your Priests (because All are imperfect) to
offer up properly a Propitiatory Sacrifice unto God.

None may hereupon oppose unto us the Propitiatory Sacrifices under the Law,
because they also were twice imperfect; once in respect of the Sacrificer, who
was but a mere man: and secondly, in respect of the matter of Sacrifice it
self, which was some unreasonable beast, and had no Virtue of Propitiation in
it self, for remission either of guilt, or of the eternal punishment of
sin, as has been See above, Chap. 5 Sect. 4.
Confessed; and therefore not properly Propitiatory, but fiuratively; only as
Types of the Sacrifice of Christ.

II. Confutation from the Romish Definition of a Propitiatory Sacrifice.

SECT. II.
SEcondly, in your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. See above, Chap. 5. Sect.
3.
Romish definition, it is required that the Thing propitiatorily sacrificed
suffer a Real Destruction, (so that it cease to be in the substance thereof)
and a Bodily Consumption. Notwithstanding you are absolutely free from the
Blasphemy, to say that Christ his Body does in the Eucharist suffer properly a
real Destruction. Ergo, say we, by your own Principle there cannot be herein
a Sacrifice properly Propitiatory.

III. Confutation from the Apostle's Position, against the Vnbloodinesse
thereof.

SECT. III.
THe Apostles Position is this, that Without the shedding of Blood there is no
Remission, Heb. 9. 22. Your Romish Assumption is; The Sacrifice of the Romish
Mass is unbloody. Our Conclusion necessarily follows, which is this; Ergo,
say we, your Masse-Sacrifice cannot be properly Propitiatory. Your Cardinal,
in Answering first that the Loquitur Apostolus de Sacrifici^s veteris Legis, --
Potest etiam absolute and generatim accipi, quod quotiescunque fit remissio,
fit sanguinis effusio: sed non nisi virtute effusionis sive nunc facta, sive
post futura. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 25.. Ad illud.
Apostle spoke this of the Sacrifice of the old Law, only stands twice
convicted of a foul Tergiversation; first, by the Apostles Explication of
himself, who although he spoke from the observation of the old Testament, Heb.
9. 22. yet does he apply it to the state of the new Testament, in the same
Chapter, verse 13, 14. But much more by his own Conscience, who having spent
some Chapters, in proving that the Sacrifices of the Law were Types of the
Sacrifice in the Mass, does now deny that this Proposition of [No Remission of
sins without shedding of Blood] is to be applied to the Eucharist. He is glad
therefore to add a second Answer, given by your Maldodonate, who finding no
security in the former Refuge, betaketh himself to another, saying that Si
accommodemus ad Evangelium, dicendum est, peccata nunc remitti, non propter
praesentem effusionem, sed per praeteritam. Maldon. Ies. lib. de 7. Sacram.
Tract. de Euch. immediate ante exitum Tom. 1.
Remission of sins is not now for any present effusion of Blood, but for that
effusion which had been. Which Answer (if we may so interpret it) is a plain
Prevarication. The Reason may be this; first, because there was never Bloody
Sacrifice (Christ on the Cross excepted, which only was of infinite virtue, as
well to times past, as to come) but it was always actually by the effusion of
Blood at the time of Sacrificing. These kinds of so ordinary Doubtings and
Turnings, which your Disputers use, as men in a maze, do plainly Demonstrate
either their irresolute Judgments, or else their dissolute Consciences; and in
either of both their desperate Cause.

We have not done yet, but give you further to understand, that as you could
find no proper Sacrificing Act, to make your Mass properly a Sacrifice, so
neither can ye show any propitiating Act, to make it properly a Sacrifice
propitiatory. This we prove out of your Council of Colen, which Si respicimus
corpus Christi, quod continetur in Euch. quis negat esse propitiatorium, non
ratione oblationis, qua^ Sacerdos facit, sed ratione Oblationis factae in
cruce? Conc. Provinc. Colon. de Missa, fol. 105. And a little after. Non
propitia^orium, ratione Sacrificii, quod est situm in action Sacerdotis, seu
Missae communicantium, aut Ecclesiae: sed ratione Sacrificii, quod in cruce
oblatum.
Concludes, that your Masse-Sacrifice cannot be called Propitiatory in respect
of any Act of Oblation of the Priest, or accommodation of the Communicants, or
yet of the Church: but only of the Oblation once made by Christ himself on
the Cross. Which oblation how absent it is, who sees not, that is present
with himself? Thus were those Divines driven to an Objective Act of Oblation.

IV. Confutation from the Romish Disvaluation of that which they call Christ's
Sacrifice.

SECT. IV.
THe last is in respect of the value, for Christ's Sacrifice on the Cross you
do Christianly esteem to have been of Mirum non est, si cum Christus
infinitus extitit, ejus hostia fuit infiniti meriti and satisfactionis.
Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. page 265, 266.
Infinite merit and Satisfaction, because it was offered by himself: and that
otherwise Erat infiniti valoris: nec enim aliter potuit compensari injuria Deo
facta. Ribera Ies. in Heb. 10. number. 19.
He could not have made Satisfaction to an Infinite and Divine Majesty. So
you. But of the Sacrifice of the Mass, what? The common opinion of our Church
(says your Valor Sacrificii Missae est finitus. Haec est communis sententia
Theologorum: in quo distinguitur a Sacrificio Crucis -- quod infinitae virtutis
erat, and nunquam repetitur. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 4.. Quarta P^op.
[And yet it is known that Card. Cajetane, C^nus, and Scotus were of a contrary
opinion.] To this last testimony of Ballarmine add also Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 5.
Tract. 33.. Tertio.
Cardinal) is that it is but of finite value. So he. Notwithstanding it be
impossible for any thing of finite virtue to have power in it self of
remission of an infinite guilt against an infinite Majesty.

CHALLENGE.
A More palpable betraying therefore of a Cause there cannot be, than (as you
have hitherto done) by defending Positions repugnant to your own Definition,
and by obtruding things as proper, which are void of all due Properties. This
being all one, as if you, in the Case of Miracles, would deliver unto us a
Iannes and Iambres, instead of Moses; in Art, Sophistry for Logique; in
Commerce (...), that is, adulterate Coin for current; and in warlike
stratagems, instead of a natural, a Trojane Horse. Oh what a misery it is to
reason with such unreasonable (to speak mildly) men! Thus much of your Romish
Sacrifice, according to your own Explanations thereof.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Romish Application of their Sacrifice.

The State of the Question.

THat the Eucharist was ordained of Christ, for the Application of remission of
sins Sacramentally to all Communicants, is the profession of all Protestants.
That the Sacrifice of Christ's Cross is therein offered up Objectively, by
Commemoration and Supplication, for all Conditions of men, has an universal
Consent among them, without Exception. But that any substantial Body, as
subjectively contained in the Mass, can be the Sacrifice of applying the
merits of Christ for remission of sins, (which is your Conc. Trid. Ut
visibile Sacrificium -- quo cruenti Sacrificii virtus in remissionem peccatorum
applicaretur. Sess. 22. cap. 1.
Tridentine faith) has been hitherto impugned and infringed thorowout our
whole former Dispute. Furthermore our present Opposition is threefold: first,
concerning the sins that are said to be remitted. Secondly, touching the
parties, who have Remission. Thirdly, in regard of your Priests, by whom
Application of Remission of sin is made.

I. That the Church of Rome is not yet resolved of the Extent of the Virtue of
her Sacrifice of the Mass, for remission of sins or Punishment.

SECT. I.
NEver can there be any true Application of the Passion of Christ for remission
of sins (say we) which is not absolute, but only partial. Your Jesuit
Ribera Ies. Quoniam quotidie peccamus, quotidie vi^tutem passionis Christi
participamus, quod Conc. Trid. docuit, quo cruentum illud, semel in cruce
peragendum, repraesentaretur, atque salutaris ejus virtus in remissionem
peccatorum eorum, quae quotidie a nobis committuntur, applicaretur. Et hoc
Catholicis quidem hominibus manifestissimum est, Haeretici negare non possunt,
quoniam Scripturae verbis apertissime comprobatur de virtute passionis, ad
omnia peccata tollenda. Romans 3. and 5. Apoc. 1. 1. Joh. 2. Com. in Heb. 1. 10.
number. 16.
Ribera seems to come on roundly toward us, and friendly to join hands with
us in this point of Application of an absolute Remission of sins, pretending
that this was Decreed in the Council of Trent, as indeed it seems to have
been, and that from the Authority of Scripture; and he adds, that
Protestants (whom he is pleased to grace with the name of See the last
Testimony.
Heretics) do not deny this manifest Truth. So he. Do you mark? a Truth, a
manifest Truth, a Truth said to be confirmed by your last Council, and a Truth
consented unto by the Heretics, as being a manifest Truth.

Who would not now look for a Truth universally professed in your Church
without all exception? But behold (even since that Council of Trent) your
greatly approved Melchior Canus steppeth forth with a peremptory Contradiction,
saying, that to hold Opinio prima. Omnes culpas mortales, and omnia peccata
(post Baptismum commissa) per Sacrificium Altaris -- sic vult Catharinus --
Haec opinio non vera, nisi omnes Theologi fallantur. Ca^^^ loc. theol. lib. 12.
page 432, 433.
All mortal sins to be remitted by the Application of the Sacrifice in the
Mass, is false, except all Divines be deceived. So he, speaking of the Divines
of the Romish Church.

Your Jesuit Valentia notes, among you, another sort of Doctors, maintaining
that your Masse-Application serves only for Vale^t. Ies. Itaque sunt, qui
censeant hoc Sacrificium valere tantum ad relaxationem poenarum, quarum culpa
prius condonata fuit. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 5.. Itaque sunt. page 542.
Remittuntur venialia. Costerus Christien. iustitut. lib. 1. cap. 8.
Remission of such temporal punishment, the guilt whereof was formerly
pardoned. So he.

CHALLENGE.
IF any shall but recollect the Contradictions of your own Doctors, thorowout
out all these former points of Controversy already handled, he will think
himself to be among the people called Andabatae, who first blind-folding
themselves fell a buffeting one another, not knowing whom they hitt; therefore
we leave them in their broiles, and our selves will consult with Antiquity.

That the Ancient Fathers never taught any Application of Christ's Passion, but
that which is for a Plenary Remission of sins.

SECT. II.
Cardinal Alan. Card. Pro iis peccatis, pro quibus Christus mortuus est. Lib.
2. de Euchar. cap. 35. [Wherein he brings the Testimonies of Chrysostom,
Cyprian, Theophylact, and Origin, expounding them of all sins, adding also;]
Ego vero nunquam invenio hujus Sacrificii usum a Patribus ad pauciora restringi
peccata, quam ipsa immolatio crucis. Ibid. page 626.
Alan has put into our hands a consent of some Fathers, for proof of an
Application for remission of all sins, for which Christ died. The Fathers,
whom he produces, are these, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Cyprian, and Origin. If
these will not suffice, you may take unto you these Calix -- sive medicamentum
and holocaustum ad sanandas infirmitates, and purgandas iniquitates. Cypr. de
coena Domini. Vt cum Deo acceptum fuerit peccata dimittantur. August. de Civit.

might be added Justine Martyr, Dial. cum Tryphone, Chrysostom. Hom. 13. in Ephesians.
Orig. Hom. 13. in Levit. besides the Liturgies of Basil, and others that are
extant.]
other, Julius Pope of Rome, Justin Martyr, Augustine, Cyril, and Basil. Do
you require any more? What needs it? seeing that the same Cardinal further
says, There is found no Father to the contrary. Thus much of the Application,
which is to be made by this Sacrament, the next is, For whom.

That the Romish Use of a singular Application of the Sacrifice of the Mass to
Non-Communicants, because of their present Attendance, is repugnant to the
Doctrine of Antiquity.

SECT. III.
THE Greek and Latin Churches anciently made up the whole Catholic Church.
The Greek pronounced an (...), that is, Be-gone, to all Non-Communicants: the
Latin Church also ordained, that the Deacon should proclaim all
Not-Communicants to Depart. From which Custom afterward the word Mass had
it is Orginall; namely from the words, [Ite, missa est] as See above, Book^ 1.
Chap. 2. Sect. 9.
has been confessed. But now the Case is so altered, that if any
Non-Communicant being present shall in Devotion apply himself to your Romish
Mass, your Canon Missa (De Applicatione) -- and omnium Circumstanstantium,
quorum tibi fides cognita est, and nota devotio, pro quibus Tibi offerimus, etc.
Canon of the Mass provides that Application of your Sacrifice be made unto
him for Remission of sins. And that, as your Jesuit teaches, Hinc Suarez
Ies. Quia oblatio hujus Sacrificii est fructuosa ex opere operato: ergo rationi
consentaneum est, ut omnes, qui ad illam vere concurrunt, vel per proprium
actum, se^ concursum moralem participent hujusmodi fructum talis oblationis. I^
3. Thom. qu. 83. Art. 1. Disp. 79.. 8.
The fruit of the Sacrifice [Ex opere operato] redoundeth unto him; and not
this only, but also to be Costerus Christian. Institutionum, lib. 1. cap. 8. de
sacro Missae officio quotidie audiendo. Quotquot adsunt and dign^ ^arant,
spiritualiter corpore Domini reficiuntur per o^ Sacerdotis.
Spiritually refreshed by the mouth of the Priest.

Be you therefore entreated to lend your Attention, but for an Instant of time,
and then tell us whether we speak Reason unto you, or no. All Antiquity
Catholic (as has been generally Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 9.
confessed by your selves) never admitted to that part of the Mass, which you
call a Sacrifice, any but such as were prepared to Communicate, in receiving
the Sacrament, but shut all others out of Doors; which, we say, they neither
would nor could lawfully have done, if they had been of your now Romish faith,
to believe that it is a Sacrifice Propitiatory for all such as devontly attend
to behold it. For, wheresoever there was a Sacrifice of Expiation among the
Jews, under the Law, all persons had liberty to partake thereof. We think
that this Argument sticks fast in the Bowels of this Cause.

That the Romish Church lesseneth the due estimation of Christ's Passion, in
her Applying of it to others, for the increasing of falsly-devised and unjust
Gain in behalf of the Priest; without all warrant of Antiquity.

SECT. IV.
HItherto we have expected some Reasons, which might move your Church so to
lessen the proportion of Christ's Passion, in the Application thereof for
remission either of sins or punishments. And now at length your Jesuit
Salmeron comes to resolve us, saying, Salmeron Ies. Si hoc esset infiniti
valoris, and celebrata esset Missa pro redemptione omnium animaru^, quae in
Expiatorio carcere continentur, totum evacuaret Purgatorium: quod non est
credendum, quia frustra tot Missae pro u^o defuncto celebrarentur. Tom. 9.
Tract. 33. page 268. De Missis privatis.
If the Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood were of infinite value, then one
Mass being said for all the souls in the Dungeon of Purgatory would evacuate
and empty the whole place, and then should it be in vain to say many Masses
for one soul. So he. We may not so far digress, as to enter into this
Controversy of Purgatory, because we are to finish that which we have now in
hand. Else were it easy to show, that the infinite gain, which your
Alchemists work out of your forge of Purgatory-fire, has occasioned this
Heterodoxe and graceless Doctrine of disannulling the infinite efficacy of
Christ's Blood: which is so utterly forlorn of all approbation from Antiquity,
that your Disputers have not alleged so much as one Iota, out of any Father,
for warrant thereof.

Next, in the Sacrifice of your Mass, there is (say Valent. Ies. Quaedam
portio remissionis competit Sacerdoti ministranti, quaedam ei, cui Sacerdos
vult peculiari intention applicare -- Quae intentio non tantum valet pro
pluribus, ac si pro uno solo celebretur. Lib. (...). de Missa, cap. ^l^.. Ac
primum. and Alan. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 34. Vt qui Sacrificium pro Petro
offert, ratione stipendii. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 79.. 9. page 1021.
you) a Portion thereof appropriated to the Priest alone, which is a power to
apply, by his Memento, the same Sacrifice to whom he will, so far forth that
he extend his Memento upon any one, to whom he shall be pleased to intend it,
upon Condition to receive money therefore: in so much that It will be more
availeable for that one, than if it were extended to many. So you. Very well,
but by what Law came your Priests to this peculiar power of dispensing a
Portion for their own advantage? Cardinal Alan. In certaru^ personarum Caus^
certam Sacrificii aestimationem, ac fructus quantitatem definite non tam certa
loquimur, quia ad ista particularia nec Scripturae, nec Patres quicquam
conferunt. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 34. page 635.
Alan (your Advocate) is ready to answer for you, and we are attentive to hear
what he says; There is not either any Scripture (says he) or Father showing
any such thing for such a manner of esteeming the fruit of Christ's Sacrifice.
So he.

In the third place, whiles we are in this speculation, we hear one of you
putting this Case. If the Priest shall receive a stipend of Peter, upon
Condition that he shall apply his Memento and Intention upon the soul of John,
departed this life, and he notwithstanding does apply it unto the good of the
soul of Paul, whether now the Priests Memento should work for the good of the
soul of John, according to the Priest's Obligation upon the Condition made
with Peter, or else for the good of the soul of Paul, according to the
Priest's immediate Intention. Here, although some of you stand for the justice
of the Inquiri potest, an tenetur Sacerdos ex justitia applicare Sacrificium
Petro, ratione ab eo accepti stipendii; nihilominus applicat Paulo: vel cum
jubetur offerre Sacrificium pro tali Defuncto, offert pro se. Quidam dicunt
Sacrificium operati in hujusmodi casibus non secundum voluntatem Ministri, sed
secundum obligationem, qua tenetur pro hoc vel illo offerre. Alii volunt
obligationem tenere -- Sed operatur secundum intentionem Ministri, quatenus est
Christi Minister* Suarez qo supra. [But your Cardinal,] Sed injuste facere.
Alan qo sup. cap. 35. page 640.
Priest's Obligation, yet some others Resolution is, that the Priest's
intention (albeit unjust) must stand for good. We have done.

CHALLENGE.
WHereas it is now evident, that your Romish Mass serves so well for your no
small gain, by appropriating of a Priestly portion to be dispensed for some
one or other soul for money, as it were the Cooks fee, and that but only for
the pains of a Spiritual Intention; yea, though it be to the Injury of the
Purchaser: It can be no marvel, that we hear so often, and as loud shouts for
your magnifying of the Roman Mass, as ever Demetrius, and his fellow
Crafts-mates made for Diana, the Goddess of the Ephesians.

It remains, that we deliver unto you a Synopsis of the Abominations of your
Romish Sacrifice, which we have reserved to be discovered in the eighth Book.
We hasten to the last Examination, which is of Protestants.

CHAP. XII.
That the Protestants, in their Celebration, offer to God a Spiritual
Sacrifice, which is Propitiatory, by way of Complacency.

SECT. I.
CAll but to mind our former See above, Chap. 1.
Distinction of a double kind of Propitiousnesse; one of Complacency, and
Acceptance, and the other of Merit, and Equivalency; and join hereunto your
own definition of Propitiousnesse by way of gracious acceptance, when you
confess that Every religious Act, whereby man in devotion adhereth entirely
unto God, in acknowledgement of his Sovereignty, mercy, and bounty, is
propitious unto God. Now then, Protestants celebrating the Eucharist with Faith
in the Son of God, and offering up to God the Commemoration of his death, and
man's Redemption thereby (a work far exceeding in worth the Creation, if it
so were, of a thousand Thousand worlds) and thereby pouring out their whole
spirit of Thankfulness unto God (in which respect this Sacrament has obtained
a more singular name than any other, to be called Eucharistia, that is, A
Giving of Thanks, and that most worthily, for as much as the end and efficacy
of Christ's Passion is no less than our Redemption from the eternal pains of
hell, and purchase of our everlasting salvation:) All these (I say) and other
Duties of holy devotion being performed not according to Man's Invention, as
yours; but to that direct, and express Prescript, and ordinance of Christ
himself [Doe this,] It is not possible, but that their whole complementall Act
of Celebration must needs be through Gods favor propitious, and well-pleasing
in his sight. Take unto you our last Proposition, concerning the second kind
of Propitiousnesse.

That the Protestants may more truly be said to offer to God a meritoriously
Propitiatory Sacrifice for Remission of Sin than the Romish do.

SECT. II.
BEfore we resolve any thing, we are willing to hear your Cardinals
Determination. The Death of Christ (says Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 3.
Mora Christi est Sacrificiu^ proprie dictum, and perfectiffimum.
he) is a proper, and most perfect Sacrifice. So he, most Christianly: But
after noting the Profession of Protestants, to hold that the same Most perfect
Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross is the only proper Sacrifice of Christian
Religion, he denies this, because (says he) Bellarm. ibid. cap. 20..
Probatur. Sublato Sacrificio Missae, nullum restat in Ecclesia Sacrificium
proprie dictum. Nam si ullum esset, id esset Sacrificium Crucis, illud enim
unum Adversarii assignant unicum esse Christianae religionis Sacrificium. At
hoc commune omnibus veris religionibus, sed semel peractum manet, quoad
effectum, and virtutem.
This is common to all true Religions, and being but once done, cease to be
any more, but only in the virtue and efficacy thereof. And all this he does
for establishing of another properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Romish
Mass, by the hands of the Priest.

But we, believing that That Sacrifice of Christ's death was but once offered
as (according to our other distinction) the only subjective, meritorious, and
properly Propitiatory Sacrifice, therefore it cease to be so any more; but
yet is still objectively perpetual in the Church of God, as the object of our
Remembrance of his Death, Representatively and Commemoratively, both in our
Acts of Celebration, and in our Prayers and Praises offered up to God in the
true apprehension of the Efficacy and Virtue thereof. In which respect (as
Christian Belief professes) Christ is called Apoc. 5. 12.
The Lamb s^aine from the beginning of the world: so is he the same still, and
ever will be until the end thereof; for which Cause our Celebration is called
of the Apostle A showing of the Lord's Death till he come. So that as by the
Bodily Eye, beholding the John 3.
Serpent on a pole in the Wilderness, they that were stung with the deadly
poison of fiery Serpents were healed: even so All, who by Faith, the Eye of the
soul, behold the Son of God lift upon the Cross, shall not perish, but have
everlasting life.

But what is that Propitiousnesse of the Sacrifice of Christ's Body (will you
say) which you Protestants will be said to offer more truly to God, than that
we Romanists do, and wherein does the difference consist? Be you as willing to
hear as to ask, and then know, that first although the whole Act of our
Celebration, in Commemoration of Christ's Death, as proceeding from us, be a
Sacrifice propitious, as other holy Acts of Devotion, only by God's Complacency
and Acceptance; Yet the object of our Commemoration being the Death and Passion
of Christ, in his Body and Blood, is to us, by the efficacy thereof, a truly
and properly propiatory Sacrifice, and Satisfaction, for a perfect remission of
all sins. Thus concerning Protestants. As for you, if we consider your own
outward Acts of Celebration, (where in Ten Circumstances we find Ten
Transgressions of the Institution of Christ, and therefore provocatory to stir
up Gods displeasure) we think not that it can be Propitiatory so much as by
way of God's Acceptance.

Next, when we dive into the mystery of your Mass, to seek out the subject
matter of your Sacrifice in the hands of your Priest, which according to the
faith of your Church is called a Proper propitiatory Sacrifice in it self; it
has been found (besides our proofs from Scriptures, and your own
Principles) by See a Synops^ hereof, Book 8.
Ten Demonstrations out of Ancient Fathers to be Sacramental Bread and Wine,
and not the Body and Blood of Christ. Wherefore the Subject of your Sacrifice
can be no more properly (that is, Satisfactorily) in it self Propitiatory,
than natural Bread can be Christ.

Lastly, in examining the End of the Propitiation by the Mass, We perceive
your Doctors in suspense among themselves, whether you be capable of
Propitiation for Remission of sins, or else of Temporal Punishments due to
such Sinners; or if of Sins, whether of mortal sins, or else of venall
sins only: to wit, such as you think may be washed away by your own
Holy Water sprinckle. Mark now, we pray you, these three: First, what you
offer, namely not to Christ, but his Sacrament. Secondly, by what Acts of
Celebration, to wit, most whereof are not Acts of Obedience, but of
Transgression. Thirdly, to what End, viz. not for a Faithful, but for a
doubtful; not for an absolute, but for a partial Remission, and that also you
know not whether of sins, or of punishments: and then must you necessarily
acknowledge the happiness of our Protestants profession, concerning the
Celebration of the Eucharist, in comparison of your Romish. How much more, when
you shall see discovered the Idolatry thereof, which is our next Task.

THE SEVENTH BOOK;
Concerning the last Romish Consequence, derived from the depraved sense of the
words of Christ, [THIS IS MY BODY;] which is your Divine Adoration of the
Sacrament; contrary to these other words of Christ, [IN REMEMBRANCE OF MEE]

CHAP. I.
WE have hitherto passed through many dangerous and pernicious Gulfes of Romish
Doctrines, which our instant haste will not suffer us to look back upon, by
any repetition of them. But now are we entering upon Asphaltites, or Mare
mortuum, even the Dead Sea of Romish Idolatry; whereinto all their
superstitious and sacrilegious Doctrines do empty themselves: which, how
detestable it is, we had rather prove, than prejudge.

The State of the Question, concerning Adoration of the Sacrament.

SECT. I.
IN the thirteenth Session of your Council of Trent, we find a Decree
commanding thus, Council. Trid. Cultum Latriae, qui vero Deo debetur, in
veneratione huic Sacramento exhibeant. Sess. 13. cap. 5.
Let the same divine honor, that is due to the true God, be given to this
Sacrament. After this warning-Peece, they shoot of a great Si quis dixerit in
hoc Sacramento unigenitum Dei filium cultu Latriae non esse adorandum; Anathema
sit. Ibid. Can. 6.
Canon of Anathema, and Curse against every one that shall not herein worship
Christ (namely, as corporally present) with Divine honor. That is to say,
Suarez Ies. Adoratione Latriae absoluta, and perfecta, qua per se adoratur
Christus -- Non solum Christum sub specie^us, sed to^um visibile Sacramentum
unico Latriae cultu, quia est unum constans ex Christo and speciebus -- Sicut
vostis -- Magna est differentiae inter has species and crucem, quae reipsa
disjuncta est (...) Ch^isto. In 3. Thom. q. 79. Disput. 65.. 1, and 2.
To adore with an absolute divine worship the whole visible Sacrament of
Christ, in the forms of bread and wine, as your Jesuit expounds it; A
worship (says he) far exceeding that which is to be given to the Crucifix.
Whereupon it is that your Priests are taught, in your Missale Romans Sacerdos
prolatis suis verbis [Hoc est corpus meum, etc.] hostiam clevat, ^amque adorat
-- adorandamque ostendit -- post genu slexo ad terram usque ipsam veneratur.
Ritus c^lebrandi Missam. Post genuflectit; inclinatur Sacramento pectus ter
percutiens, dicit, Agnus Dei qui tollis peccata mundi miscrere nobis, etc.
Canon. Missae.
Roman Missall, to elevate the Consecrated Host, and to propound it to the
people to be adored; and adoring it themselves in thrice striking their breast,
to say, O Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world have mercy upon
us. So you.

But what do they, whom you call Sacramentaries, judge of this kind of
worship, can you tell? Bellarm. Omnes Idololatriam appellant hujusmodi
adorationem. lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 29.. Porro.
All of them (says your Cardinal) call it Idolatry. But they, whom you call
Lutherans, are they not of the same Judgment? say, Greg. Valent. Lutherani nos
Idololatras vocant, seu (ut ipsi nugari solent) Artolatras. Lib. 1. de
Idololat. cap. 3.. Sed.
They call us (because of this worship) Artolaters, that is, Bread-worshippers
and Idolaters, says your Jesuit. As for our Church of England, She accordingly
says, that The Sacrament of the Lords Supper was not reserved, carried about,
lifted up, or worshipped.

Our Method must now be to treat first of Christ's Institution, or Mass; next
of the Profession of Ancient Fathers; then of your Romish Mass in it self;
and lastly we shall return again to our own home, to demonstrate the happy
Security, which our Church has in her manner of worship. So that these
contradictorie Propositions, This Sacrament is to be adored with divine
worship, and, Is not to be adored with divine worship, being the two different
scales of this Controversy, the one will preponderate the other, according to
the weight of Arguments, which shall be put into either of them.

Of the Institution of Christ; showing that there was therein neither Precept
for this Adoration of the Sacrament, nor Practice thereof.

SECT. II.
NO outward Adoration of the Sacrament was practiced of the Disciples of Christ
(say we) at the Institution thereof, which you confess with us; and take upon
you to give a reason thereof, to wit, that Coster. Ies. Nec opus erat ut
genuflexo significationem novam honoris darent, sumentes corpus dominicu^, quia
cundem habebant piaesentem, and corpus suum porrigentem, quem mente semper
colebant. Enchir. de Euch. Tit. Adoratio, Answering this Objection: Apostoli in
ultima coena hoc Sacramentum non adorabant.
There was no need that the Apostles should use any outward signification of
honor to the Sacrament, because they had then Christ present and visible
before them. So your Jesuit, which contradicts your own Objection, of
therefore adoring Christ in receiving the Sacrament, because then he Sec
hereafter, Chap. 7. Sect. 2.
Comes under the roof of your mouths; for the nearer our approach is to any
Majesty, the greater uses to be our outward humiliation. But well; no
Practice of outward Adoration by the Apostles at that time can appear, much
less have you any Evidence of any Precept for it. If there had been in the
words of Christ, or in the volume of the new Testament any syllable thereof,
your Cardinal would not have roved so far, as to Deuteronomie in the old
Testament, to fetch his only defense out of these words of God, Bellarm. lib.
4. de Euch. cap. 29. Scriptum est Deuteronomy. 6. Dominum tuum adorabis, etc.. His
praemissis.
Thou shall worship the Lord thy God; (supposing that the Bread which is
worshipped is indeed the Son of God:) which is, as it were, mere Canting,
being the basest kind of Reasoning that can be, and is therefore called of
Logitians, A begging of the point in Question.

We contrarily adhere to the Institution of Christ in all points necessary,
and essential thereunto, and knowing that the Apostle promised to deliver 1.
Cor. 11.
Whatsoever he had received of the Lord, concerning this Sacrament (which you
hold to be the principal part of your Romish Religion) we are persuaded that
he in expressing the other Commands of Christ, touching Consecration,
Administration, and Communication of this Sacrament, never taught that your
Article of divine Adoration, whereof he gave not so much as the least
intimation. The Apostolical times fail you. We shall try if the next, called
the Primitive Age, can any whit advantage your Cause, which is our second
Station.

CHAP. II.
Of the Doctrine of Antiquity, concerning the Adoration of the Eucharist.

SECT. I.
THE Judgment of Antiquity is objected by you, and the same is opposed by us
against you. Let both be put to the Trial; First, by answering of your
Objections out of the Fathers against us: and then by opposing their direct
Testimonies against you. Your Objections are partly Verbal, and partly
Practical; the Verbal are of three kinds, two whereof are specified in the
next Proposition.

That neither the objected manner of Invitation to come with fear, nor of
Association of Angels, spoken of by the Fathers, imply any Divine Adoration of
the Eucharist.

SECT. II.
OVt of Chrysostom. in Mom. ad Cor. 24. Cum horrore accedamus ad Deum. Ob.
Harding etc. I^em Bellarm. lib. 2. d^ Euch. cap. 22. Citati^ locis quibusdam
Chrysostomi, ad hae^ Adversarii neque respondent, neque respondere possint: Si
enim Angeli ad altar astant capitibus inclinatis, and cum horrore ac tremore
vix audent intueri, propter splendorem inde emicantem, quis negare potest aliud
ibi esse quam panem? Et si Angeli adorant, quis homines reprehendere potest si
adorent? Paulo superius ex Hon. 4. (...). ad Coriath Accedimus ad agnum illum
jacentem, and peccata mundi tollen^em deprecantes: ubi apertissime dielt vocari
agnum jacentem, etc. Et Hom. ad Ephesians. 3. Hostiam quam Angeli cum tremore
suscipiunt.
Chrysostom is objected his Exhortation, that Christians in their approach to
this Sacrament, Do come with horror, fear, and reverence. Next, is their
talking of the Angels, being present at this Celebration, holding down their
heads, and not daring to behold the excellency of the splendour, etc. and to
deprecate the Lamb lying on the Altar. These seem to your Cardinal to be
such invincible Testimonies, to prove the Adoration of Christ as Corporally
present, that he is bold to say, They never hitherto were answered, nor yet
possibly can be. So he; taking all Chrysostomes words in a literal sense; whom
notwithstanding your own See above, B^^ke 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3. in the
Challenge.
Senensis has made to be the most Hyperbolizing Preacher of all the Fathers:
and therefore has given unto all Divines a special Caution against his
Rhetoric, in the point of this Sacrament, lest we understand him literally.
Of which kinds you may have some Instances out of the very places Objected,
where Chrysostom. Orat. in Philogon. (...). Idem paulo superius.
Chrysostom says indeed, That we see that Lamb lying on the Altar. And said
he not also, even in the same Oration, We see here Christ lying in the Manger,
wrapped in his clouts; a dreadful and admirable spectacle? So he. But (say)
do you see herein either Cratch or Clothes? or can you talk of Christ's lying
on this Altar, who teach that, as he is in this Sacrament, he has no local
Site, Posture, or Position at all? It is also true of the Angels, he said
[(...)] they stand in dread, and the sight is fearful. And he says no less
of the festival day of Christ's Nativity, that It is most venerable, and
terrible, and the very Metropolis of all others. Yet does not this argue any
Corporal Presence of Christ, in respect of the day. This answer, taken from
Chrysostom, may satisfy for Chrysostom.

We grant furthermore to your Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 15.. Quinto --
Omnes Graeci Patres passim vocant terribile Sacrificium, and horroris plenum.
Cardinal, That all the Greek Fathers call the Eucharist terrible, and full
of dread. But what? As therefore implying a Corporal presence of Christ, and
Divine Adoration thereupon? This is your Cardinall's scope; but to prove him an
ill marke-man, take unto you an answer from your selves, See above, Book 5.
Chap. 2. Sect. 4.
who teach with the Apostle, that All profane comers to this Sacrament make
themselves guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ; in which respect we do
acknowledge it to be Dreadful indeed, especially to the wicked: but yet making
no more for a Corporal presence, than the contempt of Baptism, whereby a man
makes himself obnoxious to God's judgments, (as See above, Book 5. Chap. 2
Sect. 7.
Augustine has compared them) can infer the same. Another answer you may
receive from Ancient Fathers, who, together with the Eucharist, have See above,
Book 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 8.
called the reading of Scriptures Terrible; and so were the Canons of Baptism
called Terrible, even by Ibidem.
Chrysostom himself.

As for your objected assistance of Angels, at the Celebration of the
Eucharist, it is no such a Prerogative, but that the Prayers of the faithful,
and Baptism will plead for the same honor: your Durandus granting of the
first, that Durand. Angeli adsunt semper nobis orantibus. Lib. 7. c. 12.
The Angels of God are present with us in our prayers; and for the second,
Divine Nazianzene teaches that Nazianz. (...). Orat. 40. de Baptism.
The Angels are present at Baptism, and do magnify, or honor it with their
presence, and observance: notwithstanding none of you ever defended either
Corporal presence of Christ in the Sacrament of Baptism, or yet any Adoration
of the consecrated Element of water therein. If these two may not serve, take
unto you this saying of Augustine, spoken of persons baptized, August. de
meritis and de remiss. lib. 11. cap. 18. de baptizatis; Illi cum timore ad
medicum Christum portantur.
They (says he) with fear are brought unto Christ their Physician, that is
(for so he expounds himself) unto the Sacrament of eternal Salvation. Which
one saying of so Oxthodox a Father does instruct us how to interpret all your
objected Testimonies; to with, that Whosoever come to the receiving of the
Sacrament of Christ, they ought to come with fear, as if they were in the
presence of Christ. And thus is your unanswerable Objection answered, so that
this your Cable-rope being untwisted is become no better than loose tow. Now to
your third Objection.

That the most earnestly-objected Phrase [(...)] and Adoration, used of the
Fathers, does not necessarily infer any Divine Worship of the Eucharist.

SECT. III.
WE find not your Disputers more pressing and urgent in any Argument, than in
objecting the word, Reverence, Honor, and especially Adoration, for proof
that Divine Honor is due to the Eucharist, as to Christ himself, whenever
they find the use of that Phrase applied by Antiquity unto this Sacrament. Our
answer is first in General; That the words Reverence, Honor, and Adoration,
simply in themselves, without the adjunct and Additament, Divine, cannot
conclude the Divine worship proper to God. To this purpose we desire you not to
hearken unto us, but to hear your selves speak. M. Breerly. Pon-Pontificales
vestas, and calices coeperunt esse honorandi, Sacramenti causa. Liturg. Tract.
2.. (...). Sub^. 2.
The Pontifical Vestments, Chalices, and the like, are to be honored, say
you, but how? with divine Honor? you will not say it; nor will you hold that
ancient Bid worthy of Divine Worship, albeit you entitle him Venerable, in a
Religious respect. Yea (under the degree of divine worship) we our selves yield
as much to the Eucharist as August. Epist. 164. Baptism Christi ubique
veneramur.
Augustine did to Baptism, when he said, We reverence Baptism wheresoever it
is.

Accordingly of the word Adoration your Cardinal and other Jesuits are bold to
say, that Ribera Ies. in Apoc. 19. Item Viegas Ies. in eundem locum. Nec nos
moveat verbum hoc [Adorare] cum vulgatum sit hoc creaturis tribui, ut Loath cum
vidisset Angelos su^^exit, and adoravit eo^ pronus in terram. 3. Reg. 1.
Inclinaba^ se and adorabat Bersheba Regem prona in terram. Recte igitur
Johannes adoravit Angclum laeta nunci^; Cur Angelus recusavit, Greg. Hom. 8. in
Evang. Angelos ante adventum Christi adoratos, post assump^ humanitatem
adorationem recusasse. Eodem modo Glossa, Hugo, Rupertus, and alii nonnulli,
etc. S^ Suarez T^. 1. D^sp. 54. and Bellarm. Hieronymus non ignorabat
Adorationis multa genera, and alium soli Deo, aliam rebu^ deberi sacris. Apol.
cap. 1.. Primum. [And he reckons A ^oration of Relics, Tombs of Martyrs,
etc.
It is sometimes used also in Scriptures for an honor common to creatures, as
to Angels, to Kings, to Martyrs, and to their Tombs. And although your
Disputers should conceal this Truth, yet would the Fathers themselves inform
us in what a Latitude they used the same word Adoration. Among the Latin
Fathers, one, who knew the propriety of that Language as well as any, viz.
Tertullian, saying, Adoro plenitudinem Scripturarum. Adversus Hermog. post
medium. page 350.
I adore the plenitude of Scriptures; and Gregory Nazianzene, among the Greek,
for his excellency in divine knowledge surnamed the Divine (and therefore may
not be thought to apply words belonging to Divine (c) Greg. Nazianz. (...).
Orat. 40.
Worship preposterously or improperly) instructed the partty baptized to say
thus to the Devil, Fall down [(...)] and worship me. Thus much in General.

Let us proceed, You to your particular Objections; and We to our Answers. 1.
Ob. Ambrose says, that Ambros. lib. 3. de Spir. sanct. cap. 12. Iractans illum
locum Psalm. 98. [Adorate Scabellum pedum ejus.] Per Scabellum terra
intelligitur, per terram autem ca^o Christi, quam hodie quoque in mysteriis
adoramus: and quam Apostoli in Domino Jesus adoraverunt. Ob. 1. per Bell. Apol.
cap. 8. page 107. Hic locus nullam admittit solutionem. Item lib. 2. de Euch.
cap. 14.
We adore in these mysteries the flesh of Christ, as the foot stool of his
Deity. You call this an Argument infallible: nay (say we) but false, because
Ambrose does not say, that we adore the Sacrament, (which is the point in
Question) but that in our mystical Celebration of the memory of Christ his
Passion, we are to adore his humanity, namely as it is hypostatically united to
the person of his Godhead, which all Christians profess as well as you, yea
even in Baptism also. 2. Ob. Aug. in Psalm. 98. Nemo illam carnem manducat,
nisi prius adoraverit. Ob. Bell. Alius locus insignis. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap.
24.. Alius.
None (says Augustine) does eat the flesh of Christ before he adore it. A
Testimony which seems to you Notable: but which we judge to be indeed not
able at all to prove the Divine Adoration of the Sacrament, even in the
Judgment of Saint Augustine, who has everywhere distinguished between the
Sacrament and Christ's Flesh, as between Bread and Christ's Body, as has
been often demonstrated. His meaning therefore is no more but this, that
whosoever shall communicate of this Sacrament, the Symbol of Christ, must
first be a true Christian, believing that Christ is not only man, but God
also, and adore him accordingly with Divine honor, as well before and without
the Sacrament, as at the receiving thereof. Even as Athanas. contra M^ced.
Di^l. 1. page 265. (...).
Athanasius spoke of Baptism, saying that The Catechumenists did first adore
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, before that they were to be baptized in
their names. And is there any of your Priests so unchristian, as not to adore
Christ, before he come to the Communion? A plain Case.

Will you have any more? The places alleged out of Saint Augustine, by you,
are like Bellerophons Letters to confute you; for lest Saint Augustines Reader
might mis-construe the meaning of Christ's words, by perverting them to a
Corporal and Orall eating of his Flesh, Aug. in Psalm. 98. Non hoc corpus, quod
videtis manducaturi estis -- spiritualiter intellectum vivi^icavit.
Saint Augustine adds (bringing Christ speaking to the Jews, concerning the
eating of his flesh) You are not to eat this flesh, which you see: he says
not, You are not to see the flesh which you shall not eat, (which is your
Romish Iuggling.) But thus, You are not to eat the flesh which you see, namely
that, which then was visible when Christ was in the world. This one Testimony
of Augustine may satisfy for the present, until another shall be delivered
fom him, absolutely See hereafter, Chap. 4. Sect. 2.
confuting your Tridentine Faith of the Divine worship of the Host, to prove it
Idolatrous.

Theodoret seems unto you to come off roundly, saying Theod. Dial. 2. Signa
mystica post sanctificationem manent in priore substantia, figura, and ^or^a,
sicut p^ius: Intelliguntur autem ea, quae facta sunt, and creduntur: and
[(...)] adorantur. Ob. Bell. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 27.. Sed apertissime --
asserit praesentiam Domini in Euch. quia p^nis consecratus est vere id quod
intelligitur, Creditur, and Adoratur.
That Symbols and Signs are believed and adored, whereby he most evidently
teaches the presence of Christ's flesh (as says your Cardinal:) even so, as
commonly he uses to do in alleging of other Testimonies, both unconscionably
against his knowledge, and unluckily against his Cause. For with what
Conscience can he urge the word Adoration here, as most evidently noting a
Divine worship of the Sacrament, seeing that he has before confessed the same
word, Adore, to be used of the Fathers sometimes for worship communicable to
Angels, and Saints, and to their Tombs? yea, and when as also Theodoret (which
proves your Cardinal's Objection lucklesse) does expressly say, that The
substance of bread remains, meaning absolutely the proper substance of Bread
(as has been See this discussed to the full, Book 3.
copiously proved) whereunto no Divine worship can be lawfully given, not only
in the Faith of all other Catholic Fathers; but even in the belief of the
Roman Church at this day? And although the Symbols, and Signs (as you fancy)
were mere Accidents, yet dare not you your selves say that they are to be
properly adored with Divine Worship.

Hitherto have we insisted upon the words objected out of the Fathers, by you,
with more eage^nesse, than either with good Judgment or Conscience. Your next
Objections are taken from the Acts, whereunto we address our Answers.

CHAP. III.
That no objected Act out of the Fathers, for proof of an Invocation by Divine
Adoration of the Eucharist, is conscionably alleged; not the first, which is
their prescribed Concealment of this Mystery.

SECT. I.
ACTS insisted upon by you, for proof of Adoration, are these; The Fathers
injoyning a Concealment of this Mystery from some others: their Elevation of
the Host after Consecration: their Cautelousnesse in administering it, without
letting any part thereof fall to the ground: their Bodily Gesture in token of
Humiliation; and their pretended Invocating on it. We acknowledge (that we may
begin with the first) how strictly the Ancient Fathers generally prescribed to
others, (which they observed themselves) that this Mystery should be kept
secret from all persons, who were not initiated by Baptism, and incorporated
thereby into the visible Church of Christ, were they Infidels or Catechumenists
(that is) unbaptized Christians. Upon this our Confession, as the Base, hearken
what a discant your Doctors can chant, saying as follows; Bellarm. lib. 2. de
Eucl. cap. 2. citat Augustine. Sermon. 10. de verbis Apost. viz. Quod corpus dixit
escam, and sanguinem potu^, Sacramentum fidelium agnoscunt fideles -- Et hanc
phrasin [norunt fideles] habet in lo^is infinitis: at profecto non est
fidelibus tantum notum, quod corpus Christi fide percip^atur. Idem objicit
Cla^di^^ de Sanctis ante lib. de Litur^iis Patrum. Rurs^ Bellar. (...) sup.
cap. 15. At cette nulla reddi potest causa, cu^ Eucharistiam ne videri quidem
permitterent Infidelibus, vel etiam Catechumenis, si nihil est nisi signum.
The Fathers said of this mystery of the Eucharist that only [Fideles norunt]
the faithful know it: and therefore we must be persuaded they understood a
Corporal Presence of Christ herein; and consequently a Divine Adoration due
unto it. Master Breerly swells big, in amplifying this Objection; take a
brief of the whole. The Fathers professing to write more circumspectly of this
Sacrament, so as not daring to explain it, as Theodoret, Origin, Augustine,
Chrysostom; this were causlesse, if the Fathers had thought Christ's words
figurative; nor had it been more necessary in this than in Baptism, had the
Fathers acknowledged no other presence in this, than in Baptism, etc. So he.

Well then, by your own judgment, if it may be found that the Fathers
observed alike Circumspection in the manner of uttering, and Cautelousnesse in
concealing the Sacrament of Baptism from Infidels, and Catechumenists; then
must you confess that this your Argument makes no more for proof of a
Corporal Presence in the Eucharist, as you would have it, than in Baptism,
where you confess it is not. And now behold the Fathers are as precise in
conclealing the Mystery of Baptism, from all Persons unbaptized, even in as
express terms as was spoken of in the Eucharist; Chrysostom saying, (against
such Persons) Chrysostom. in Gal. 4. Non natura, sed Dei, promissio Sacramentum
fecit: sic ^enascentia nostra natura quidem nulla est, c^terum verbum Dei,
(...).
The faithful know this. And again, entering into a discourse of Baptism, he
prefaceth saying; And again in 1. Cor. Hom. 40. about to ^ntreat of the words
of S. Paul, [Quid facient ii, qui baptizantur pro mortuis? [(...).
I would indeed speak this plainly, but I dare not, because of them that are
not initiated, or Baptized. And Dionysius, the supposed Areopagite, Dionys.
Hierarch. cap. 2. (...).
Let none that is not a perfect Christian be admitted to the sight of the
signs of Baptism: even as the Council Conc. Arausican. 1. Catechumeni non
sunt ad Baptismum admittendi. Can. 19.
Arausicanum also decreed. Which Cautions are long since antiquated by disuse
in Churches Christian, because all are now baptized that come to behold this
Sacrament. If hereupon any Protestant shall infer a Corporal presence of
Christ in Baptism, and consequently an Adoration of Christ in the same
Sacrament, you your selves (we know) would but hiss at him, in detestation of
his Consequence, as judging it Idolatrous.

But do you ask, why then the Fathers did teach Christians not to speak of
these Mysteries in the hearing of the Catechumenists? Saint Augustine himself
(whom your Cardinal has brought in for defense of Corporal presence) will
resolve us, and witness against him, telling him, that the reason was not the
sublimity of the matter, as though they could not apprehend it, but because
Aug. Tom. 9. Tract. 96. in Ioh. Quid si eis fidelium Sacramenta non
producuntur, non ideo fit, quod ea far non possent, sed ut ab iis tanto
ardenti^s concupiscantur, quanto honorabilius eis occultantur. [Speaking of the
Catechumenists.]
The more honorably the Sacraments are concealed (speaking in general) the
more ardently they would be coveted and desired. As for their not revealing
them unto Infidels, the reason is evident; Infidelity is a mocker, and they
meant to preserve Christ's Sacrament from contempt. Thus your most specious
Objection serves for nothing more than to prove your Disputers to be
wonderfully precipitant in their Arguing.

That the objected Elevation, or lifting up of the Host, and preserving of it
from falling, are no Arguments of Adoration.

SECT. II.
SEcondly, the Elevation of the Host over the head of the Priest is your
ordinary Objection, for proof of a Divine Adoration; although you have Suarez.
See above, Book 6. Chap. 1. Sect. (...). at (a).
confessed, that this was not of prime Antiquity. But supposing Elevation to
have been so ancient, yet was it not to the end it should be adored, no more
than was the Book of the Gospel, in the Roman Church, when it was (according
to the Rite then) Durant. de Ritib^ lib. 2. cap. 23. number. 7. (...) ordine
Romano Diaconus osculan^ Evangelium, levat in manus codicem, and partem ejus in
dextro humero ponens, vadi^ ad Ambonem.
Lift up by the hands of the Deacon, and carried on hi^ right shoulder. What
else will you say of the Priest's Elevation? you would persuade (in the Ida^ d^
Ritib. lib. 2. cap. 40. in Psalm. 7^. In capite montium: hoc est (ait Rabbi
Jonathan) Sacrificium in capitibu^ Sacerdotum. Durand. Rational. lib. 4. cap.
42. number. 54. Elevatur, ut populu^ congressu^ consecrationem factam esse, and
Christum super Altar venisse reverenter prosternatur in terram, and illum ore
adoret. Et Durant. quo supra. Adorationis ergo Eucharistiam in altum attolli,
Durandus and Ivo asserunt, Probabile est.
Margent) by some, that the Priest lifting the Host over his head, was
prophesied of by the Psalmist; And, that the Rite of holding the Host up was
chiefly that the people knowing it to be now consecrated, should understand
that Christ is on the Altar, whom they are to Adore by falling down on the
ground. Whereof albeit some of you speak more confidently, yet the most
principal searcher into Antiquity da^e say no more, than only This is probable.

We contrarily conceive, that that Rabbinish interpretation can be no good
ground to rest upon, which See above, Book 3.
has bin rejected by Bellarmine, as being Idle and Frivolous. 2. That the
Ceremony of Elevation (as has See above, Book 6. Chap. 6. Sect. 5.
been confessed) was neither instituted by Christ, nor yet always in use in
Christ's Church. 3. That the same Elevation, albeit used after Consecration,
does not so much as Probably prove it was for Adoration-sake, because it was as
well in use in your lifting up of the Host before Consecration; as your
objected Missalls published by Claudius Saints a Parisian Dr. Before
Consecration, in the Missall of S. James, Attollens: In the Mass of Basil,
Exa^ans pane^.
Missal's of Saint James, and Basil do manifest. Lastly, that where Elevation
was practiced after Consecration, the objected Authors confute your Assertion,
for in Chrysostom it is read, After Consecration, in the Mass of Chrysostom,
Modicum (...)tollens Sacerdos, dicit Sancta sanctis.
That the Priest did take a portion out of the dish, and held it up but a
little: this is not lifting it over the Head, or very high, as your reason for
Adoration would require. And in your objected Saint In Dionys. Areopag.
relating the form of their Mass, objected by Duran^ de ^iti^. lib. 2. cap.
40. Mysteria, quae ante laudaverat Sacerdos, venerandis oper^a signis in
conspectum agi^, divinaque mu^cr^ reverenter ostenden^, ad Sacram Communionem
convertitur. [Wherein there is no one word of* Venerandis, or Reverenter, but
this.] (...), (...) (...), etc. Dionys. Areopag. cap. 3.
Denis there is no more, but that The sacred celebrated Symbols were brought
into light, which after Consecration he terms Uncovered Bread* divided of the
Priest into many parts. Bread (we say) broken after Consecration; which is the
break-necke of your whole Defense.

Your third Objection is the diligent Caution given by Ancient Fathers, to take
heed* Ter^ll. in lib. de Cor^^^ milit. Calicis a^t panis aliquid in terram
discuti, anxie patimur. Ob. by Mr. Breerly, Liturg. Tract. 2. Sect. 8. Subd. 4.
page 216. And out of Origin. Hom. 5. in Levit. Take heed no little crumme fall
to the ground. Tract. 4. Sect. 6. And Pius Bishop of Rome ordained that ye
consecrated Bread and Wine falling to the ground should be left to the
Sacrificer, and the rest remaining should be burnt with fire unto as^es. So
great a Reverence was then prescribed. Ibid. Tract. 2. Sect. 8. Subd. 4.
Lest that any Crum should fall to the ground, and if any little part thereof
should fall, it should be left to the Priest, and the Remainder of the
Sacrament after the Mass (say you) should be burnt to ashes, and the ashes
laid up. So you. Pharaoh his Butler and ^aker, we are sure, would have been
loath to miscarry in spilling, or letting fall any part of their carriage, when
they were to present their service unto their King; much more carefully ought
every Christian, in executing his sacred Function, to observe the Laws of
Decorum. Mark we, by the way, Master Breerly durst not call the part falling
any thing but a Part, not A part of Christ's Body, that were Impious, not a
part of Accidents that were absurd: what means this childish Fabling trow we,
but that if they should speak out, they should betray their Cause, in calling
that little part a part of Bread, as your objected Dionysius spoke? And when
all is said, we hear no proof of Divine Adoration of the Host. But we leave
you to take your Answer from your Cardinal, who has told you that See above,
Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 10. in Answer to the second Pretense.
Casual spilling of the Cup is no sin.

Only we must again insist in the former Observation, to wit, the frequent
speeches of the Fathers, telling us of Crumbs, Fragments, little parts of this
Sacrament; and of Burning them into ashes, after the Celebration ended. Now
answer us, in good sadness; was it ever heard of, we say not of ancient
Fathers, but of any professing Christianity, were they Catholics or Heretics,
who would not have judged it most execrable for any to say, or think that A
crum, or little part of Christ's body falls? or that by a dash of the Cup,
the blood of our Lord is spilt? or that the Primitive Fathers, in the Remainder
of the Sacrament, Burned their Savior? Yet these must they both have thought,
and said, if (as you speak of Eating, Swallowing, feeding Corporally of
Christ's Body, the Body of Christ were the proper Subject of these accidental
Events.

That the Objection taken from any Gesture, used in the days of Antiquity,
does not prove a Divine Adoration of the Eucharist.

SECT. III.
GEsture is one of the points, which you object, as more observable than the
former, but how? Because Chrysostom will have the Communicant take it with
Chrysostom. in Liturg. Post^a fimiliter Sacerdos s^it sanctu^ pan^, in^ato capit^
ante sacra^ mens^ oran^.
Inclining hit head down before the holy Table. Cyril, by Cyril. Hierosol.
Mys^^g. 5. Accede ad calice^ ^anguinis illius pro^ [(...).]
Bowing after the manner of Adoring. You will be still like your selves,
insisting upon Heterogenies, and Arguments which conclude not ad idem. For
first, the Examples objected speak not of Bowing down to the Sacrament, but
of our Bowing down our heads to the ground, in signification of our
Unworthiness; which may be done in Adoring Christ with a [Sursum corda] that
is, Lifting up our hearts to Christ above. And this may become every Christian
to use, and may be done without divine Adoration of the thing before us.

Nay and that no Gesture, either standing, sitting, or kneeling, is necessary
for such an Adoration, your greatest Advocate does show out of Antiquity, and
affirms this as a Point (as Esp^ncae^s. Nec disputatio super Adorandi gestu,
cum de Adorationis substantia inter omnes semper conven^rit, ac etiamnum
convenit, stantes aut ^edentes, proni aut supini, erecti aut geniculati

Adoratio non tam in externo cult^, quam intimo mentis affectu cernitur. Lib. 2.
de Adorat. cap. 16. initio.
he says) agreed on by all; adding that Divine Adoration consists not in the
outward. Gesture, but in the Intention of the mind. For indeed, there is no
one kind of outward Gesture, which (as you have confessed) is not also
communicable to man: so that although that were true, which is set down in the
Rubricke of The Latin is, Inclinantes Altari: but ^nce I find it in the
Greek (before Consecration) (...); and so thrice the l^ke. After Consecration;
(...). And again; (...). [Behinde the Table bowing down his head.] And
again, (...).
Chrysostomes Liturgy, that the Ministers did use to Incline their Bodies to
the Altar, yet none can be so simple, to think that they did yield divine
honor unto an Altar. Nay, your own great Master of Ceremonies Durant. Peracta
thurificatione, Sacercerdos leviter incurves^it ante Altar -- dum autem
inclina^ Sacerdos, humilitatem Christi significat. -- Sacerdos reflexus ad
Altar, cum paratur Consecratio* Lib. 2. de Ritib. cap. 25.
Durantus has observed the like Bowing down of the Priest in the preparation
of this Sacrament, even Before consecration; and one of your Jesuits reports
your objected Vasquez Ies. Graeca Ecclesia unto Consecrationem reveren^er
adorat, etiam ^i non sit ibi Christus. D^ Adorat. lib. 2. cap. 11. [Falsly
commenting that this was Divine honor, and just.]
Greek Church at this day to Adore the Bread and Wine unconsecrated, albeit
they believe no Presence of Christ herein.

This being known, how can you in any credibility conclude, as you have done,
a Corporal presence of Christ in this Sacrament after Consecration, from a
Reverence which has been yielded to the same Sacrament, before it was
consecrated? In which consideration your Disputers stand so much the more
condemnable, because, whereas they show some Examples of a Bodily Inclining to
the Sacrament, done before Consecration, yet after Consecration they have not
produced any one.

But what news now? We blush, in your behalf, to repeat the Instance which
you have out of your Legends, of a Mr. Breerly Liturg. Tract. 2.. 9. Subd. 3.
[out of Bellarm. and Bellarm. out of Antoninus] -- When (not unlike to the
reproof which God miraculously gave to Balaam by the speech of an Ass) a
bruit-beast for our instruction did prostrate himself in reverence before the
blessed Sacrament.
Brute Beast prostrating it self before the Host, and doing Reverence unto it.
We would have concealed this, but that you seem to glory herein, as being for
your Instruction, like to the reproof given miraculously to Balaam by his
Ass. Well might this Legend have become that latter time of darkness, wherein
it was first hatched, but not these clear days, wherein your mysteries of
Delusions have been so often revealed, and when all Christians almost in all
Countries have taken knowledge of an BA^ HORST ^rding to his Masters own
Relation.
Horse taught by Art to kneel to any person at his Masters command; and once
in France, when, by the Suggestion and Instigation of Romish Priests, his
Master was called into question for Sorcery, he for vindication of his credit
with them, commanded his horse to kneel before a Crucifix, and thereby freed
himself from suspicion of Diabolical familiarity, according to the Principles
of their own superstition. And for any one to conclude this to have been God's
miraculous work in that Horse, (as the other was in that Ass) would seem to
be the Reason of an unreasonable man; because all Miracles always exceed all
power both of Art, and Nature; else were they no Miracles at all. Thus to your
fourth Objection from outward Acts, we pass on to Examples.

That no Example of Invocation, objected out of Antiquity, can infer the Divine
Honor of the Sacrament, as is pretended.

SECT. IV.
YOur Instances are Three; the principal in Gorgonia, the Sister of Gregory
Nazianzen, in whose Oration, at her funeral, we find that Greg. Nazianz.
Orat. 11. de Gorgonia. S^ror Gorgonia adver^a copori^ val^^udine laborabat --
^r^tque prodigiosum mor^i genus, quod n^c Medicoru^ art, nec parentum
lachrymis, nec publicis precibus sanari potuit: desperatis omnibus aliis

She having been troubled with a prodigious disease, after that neither the
Art of Physic, nor tears of her Parents, nor the public Prayers of the
Church could procure her any health; went and cast her self down at the
Altar, invocating Christ, who is honored on the Altar, saying that she would
not remove her head from the Altar, until she had received her health: when
(Oh admirable event!) she was presently freed from her disease. This is the
Story set down by Gregory Nazianzene. Hence your Cardinal concludes, that
Gorgonia invocated the Sacrament, as being the very Body and Blood of Christ,
and calls this An hor and stinging Argument; and so indeed it may be named,
yet only in respect of them, whose consciences are scorched, or stung with
their own guiltiness of enforcing, and injuring the story, as will now
appear.

For first, why should we think that she invocated the Sacrament? Because
(says your Bellarm. Procumben^ ante Altar coram venerabili Sacramento -- Quid
autem super altar colatur, dubium esse non potest, cum ^ihil ibi ponatur nisi
panis and vinum, mutand^ in corpus and sanginem Christi -- Petru^ Martyre^
valde u^^it pupugitque hic locus. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 14.
Cardinal) she prostrated her self at the Altar, before the Sacrament; which
words [Before the Sacrament] are of his own coining, and no part of the Story.
His next reason; Because she is said to have invocated him, who is honored on
the Altar. As though every Christian praying at the Table of the Lord, to
Christ, may not be justly said to Invocate him, who is used to be Honored by
the Priest, celebrating the memory of Christ thereon. Nay, and were it granted,
that the Sacramental Symbols had been then on on the Altar, yet would it not
follow, that she invocated the Sacrament, as betokening a Corporal presence of
Christ (as your Disputers have fancied) no more, than if the said godly woman
upon the same occasion presenting her self at the sacred Font, wherein she had
been baptized, could be thought to have invocated the water therein; because
she was said to have invocated him, who is honored in the Administration of
Baptism. And furthermore it is certain, that the Remainders of the Sacrament
in those days were kept in their Pastophorium, a Ste^ve, Book 1. Chap. 1.
Sect. 10. As further also appears in the Liturgy of Pope ^nt; Accip^ant
D^aco^ reliquias, and portent in Pa^^ophoria (Doub^less^, from the Al^ar to a
pla^e remote.) Test^ Pamel^ Tom. 1. M^ssal. Pa^rum ^atin. page 118.
place severed from the Altar, especially at this time of her being there,
which was in the Night, as the Story speaks.

O! but she was cured of her disease at the Altar. And so were other miraculous
Cures wrought also at the Font of S^e above, Book 4. Chap. 2 Sect. 5.
Baptism But, for a Conclusion, we shall willingly admit of Gregory Nazianzene
to be Vmpier between us. He, in relating the Story, says of the Sacrament of
the Eucharist, (See the Above at the letter (a).
Margent above) that If she had at that time of her invocating held the
Antitypes (or Symbols) of the Body and Blood of Christ in her hands, they had
been mingled with her tears. So he, calling the consecrated Sacrament
Antitypes, or Signs of Christ's Body: thereby signifying, that the Sacrament
is not the Body and Blood of Christ, as has been Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6.
proved unto you at large out of Nazianzene, and other Greek Fathers. Whereas
if indeed he had meant that the Body and Blood of Christ had been there
corporally present, as that which was Invocated; then now (if ever) it had
concerned this holy Father to have expressly delivered his supposition thus,
viz. If the Body and Blood of Christ had been then held in her hands, her
tears had been mingled with them, viz. Body and Blood; and not (as he said)
with the Antitypes, or Signs of his Body and Blood. Thus is your hot and
stinging Reason become chilly, cold, and altogether dronish.

Your second Instance is in Dionysius* the Areopagite, who writing of the
Sacrament B^llarm. Dionys. Ar^op. Hier. cap. 3. part. 3. O divinissimum and
sacrosanctum Sacramentum, obducta ^ibi significantium signorum operimenta
aperi, etc. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 3. Item ipsum invocat Sacramentum, and petit
ab ipso, quae a solo Deo recte peti possunt. And Durant. de R^tib. lib. 2. cap.
11. And indeed who not?
said, O most divine Sacrament, reveal unto us the mystery of thy signs, etc.
which in the ears of your Disputers ringeth a flatt Invocation of the
Sacrament. Contrariwise we confidently affirm, that your Teachers have taken a
figure Prosopopoeia for Invocation; like men who take Moonshine for Daylight,
as we shall manifest by Examples, Confessions, yea and the very Instance of
Dionysius himself.

Prosopopoeia then is a figure, when one calls upon that which has no sense,
as if it had sense; as when in Scripture the Prophet said, Hear o Heavens, and
hearken o Earth, Isa. 1. In like manner, among the Ancient Fathers, one called
upon his own Church Anastasia, whence he was to depart, and saying thus,
Nazianz. Orat. 32. (...).
Oh Anastasia, which have restored our Doctrine, when it was despised! Others
of the Element of Baptism, thus: Oh water that has washed our Savior, and
deserved to be a Sacrament! or thus, Ambros. in Luc. lib. 10. cap. 22. O aqua,
^u aspersum sanguine (Christum) l^visti, Sacramentum Christi esse meruisti, etc.
Oh water which once purged the world! or thus, Optat. lib. 6. cont. Parmen. O
aqua, quae and purum ^eceras orbem, and terram lavisti.
Oh divine Lavacre, etc. Nay, you your selves can sing, and chant it to the
Cross, O salve Crux, ^pes unica! auge piis just^^iam, etc. Est Prosopopoeia.
Vasquez Jes. lib. 2. de Adorat. Disp. 9. cap. 4. page 445.
O Cross our only hope, etc. and in expounding the same, allow no more than a
Prosopopoeia and figurative speech, lest that otherwise your Invocation may be
judged Idolatrous. And whereas in another Romish Anthem it is sung of the
Eucharist, Oh holy Feast! This saying (says another O sacrum convivium! quod
omni Sacramento convenit. Tolet. Jes. Instruct. Sacerd lib. 2. cap. 15 p. 366.
Jesuit) agrees to every Sacrament. Thus have you heard both from Fathers,
and from your selves the like Tenor of Invocation; Oh Church! Oh Water! Oh
Cross! Oh Feast! nothing differing from Dionysius his Oh Divine Sacrament! yet
each one without any proper Invocation at all.

And that you may further understand, that this Dionysius his OH! is as in
voice, so in sense the same which we judge it to be, what better Interpreter
can you require of this Greek Author Dionysius, than was his Greek Scholiast
Pachumeres? who has given his Judgment of this very speech directly, saying
that Pachym. in locum Dionys. (...). Ex Orat. in obitum Gorgon.
It was spoken as of a thing having life, and that fitly, as did Nazienzene
(says he) when he said of the Feast of Easter; O great and holy Feast! etc.
And how should this be otherwise? seeing Dionysius, at the writing hereof, was
not in any Church, or place where the Eucharist was celebrated, but privately
contemplating in his mind upon this holy Mystery. The due consideration of
these your former so frivolous, and so false Objections provokes us to cry
out, saying, Oh Sophistry, Sophistry! when will thou cease to delude the souls
of men? In which manner of speech, notwithstanding, we do not Invocate, but
rather detest, and abominate your Romish Sophistry. And lest any of you should
stumble upon the Attribute, which Dionysius gives to the Eucharist, in calling
it a Divine Sacrament, as if it should imply a Corporal Presence therein, read
but one Chapter of the same Author, and he will teach you to say as much of
many other things, wherein you will not believe any Corporal Existence of
Christ we are sure: for there he equally names the place of Celebration, See
above, Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 13.
Divine Altar; the Sacramental Signs, Divine Symbols; the Minister, Divine
Priest; the Communicants, Divine People; yea and (which may muzzell every
Opponent) the matter of this Sacrament, Divine Bread.

In the third place is objected this saying of Basil; When the Bread is shown,
what holy Father has left in writing the words of Invocation? Thus that
Father, whence your Father Bellarmine thus; Basil. lib. de Spir. sancto, cap.
27. Verba Invocationis, cum ostenditur, quis Sanctorum in scripto nobis
reliquit?] Hunc habemus morem veteris Ecclesiae, ut post consecratione^
oftenderetur populo Eucharistia, quod nunc fieri videmus, and conceptis verbis
invocaretur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 15.. Alterum. And Durant. de
Ritib. lib. 2. cap. 11. Plane ab ipsis Ecclesiae incunabulis post
Consecrationem Eucharistiam in altum tollere, Dionys. and Basil. de Spiritu
Sancto, cap. 27, etc.
Hence know we the Custom of the ancient Church, namely, that the Eucharist is
shown to the people after Consecration: And that Then (as we see now done
among us) it was Invocated upon, even plainly after Consecration, says your
Durantus also, and indeed almost who not? But do you first, if you please,
admire the wit of your Cardinal in so framing his Consequence, and after abhor
his will to decive you, when you have done: for he applies the words spoken by
Basil of an Invocation before Consecration, (when as yet, by your own
Doctrine, Christ is not present) as spoken of an Invocation of the Eucharist
after Consecration, for proof of a Corporal Presence of Christ therein, and
the Divine Adoration thereof, as will most evidently appear. For first it is
not unknown to you, that the Greek Church differs from your Roman in the
form of Consecration at this day, they consecrating in words of prayer, and
Invocation, and you in the repetition of Christ's words [This is my Body]
wherein there is Proved above, Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 3. in the Challenge.
no Invocation at all. And Basil was of the Greek Church. Secondly, your
Archlep. Caesariensseu Christoph. de Capite sontium, Tract. var. Sacerdos
invocando Deum panem consecravit: Hanc alii, ut Tertulianus, Iren. Justin.
Gratiarum actionem hujusmodi Invocatione^ seu benedictionem vocant. p. 34
Alicu^^ Theodoretus, Basil. Cyril. Hierosol. Iren. Damascen. Theoph. Alex.
vocant Eucharistiae formam (...), Invocationem. Ibid. page 33. And be
alleges your Lindanus for a Suffragator in this point.
Archbishop of Cesarea, for proof that Invocation by prayers was a form of
Consecration used primitively in the Greek Church, cites the two most ancient
Fathers, Tertullian and Irenaeus; and of the Greek he alleges Iustine,
Cyril, Damascen, Theophilus Alex. yea, and (by your leave) Basil himself too:
and that Basil was an Orthodox Greek Father you will not deny.

Thirdly therefore (to come home unto you) we shall be directed by the objected
words of Basil himself, appealing herein to your own consciences. For your
Lindanus was, in the estimation of your Church, the strongest Champion in his
time for your Roman Cause; he, to prove that the form of Consecration of the
Eucharist stands not in any prescribed words in the Gospel, but in words of
Invocation by prayer (as See Book (...). Cha. 2.
has been confirmed by a Torrent of Ancient Fathers) says, Paulus non
tradidit formam Consecrationis, quod Basilius ita illustrat, ut sano capiti
nihil ad haec sit ullo modo requirendum amplius, cap. 42. de Spi^. sancto;
Verba, dum ostenditur pani^ (inquit) and poculum benedictionis quis Sanctorum
nobis reliquit? Lindan. Pa^^p. lib. 4. cap. 41.
That the same is illustrated by these words of Basil, saying, What Father has
left unto us in writing the words of Invocation, when the Bread is shown unto
us? adding, That no man of sound Brains can require any more, for the clearing
of the point concerning the form of Consecration. So then, Invocation was an
Invocation by Prayer unto God, for the Consecration of the Bread set before
them, and not an Invocation of Adoration unto the Eucharist, as already
consecrated; which your Cardinal unconscionably (we will not say, unlearnedly)
has enforced.

Look upon the Text again, for your better satisfaction; It speaks expressly
of an Invocation, when Bread is shown: but you deny that Bread is Invocated
upon, until after Consecration. And Basil demanding [What Father before us
has left in writing the words of Invocation?] is in true and genuine sense, as
if he had expressly said, what Father before us has left in writing the words
of Invocating God by Prayer of Consecration of Bread, to make it a Sacrament?
as both the Testimonies of Fathers above confessed manifest, and your objected
Greek Missals do ratify unto us. For, in the Liturgy ascribed to Saint
Liturg. Iac. [Sancte Domine, etc.]
James the Apostle, the Consecration is by Invocating and praying thus, Holy
Lord who dwell in holiest, etc. The Liturgy of Liturg. Chrysostom. [Adhuc
offerimus -- mitte Spiritum, etc.
Chrysostom invocateth by praying; We beseech thee, O Lord, to send thy Spirit
upon these Gifts prepared before us, etc. The Liturgy under the name of
Liturg. Basil. [R^spice Domine.]
Basil consecrateth by this Invocation, when the Priest lifts up the Bread,
Look down, O Lord Jesus our God, from thy holy habitation, and vouchsafe, etc.
All these therefore were (according to the Example of Christ) Invocations, that
is, Prayers of Consecrating the Sacrament; and therefore could not be
Invocations and Adorations of the same Sacrament. And as for any express or
prescribed form or prayer to be used of All, well might Basil say, Who has
set it down in writing? that is, It was never delivered either in Scripture,
or in the Books of any Author of former Antiquity; and this is that which is
testified in your own Decret. part. 1. C. 11. Ecclesiasticorum. Aug. ex
Basilio; Quae scripta nobis, quibus verbis sit Consecratio, commendavit?
Books of Augustine, out of Basil, saying that No writing has delivered in
what words the form of Consecration was made.

Now then, guess you what was in the brains of your Disputers, in objecting
this Testimony of Basil, contrary to the evident Sense; and accordingly judge
of the weakness of your Cause, which has no better supports than such fond,
false, and ridiculous Objections to rely upon. Such as is also that your
Origenes dixit, Domine, non sum dignus, etc. Ergo vel vult adorari and invocari
panem, vel Christum ipsum hic contineri. Bellaram. lib. 2. de Luch. cap. 8..
Alterum.
Cardinal his objecting the words of Origin, concerning the receiving of this
Sacrament, saying, Lord I am not worthy thou should come under the roof of
my mouth: which has been confuted, as unworthy the Sea above, Book 5. Chap.
5. Sect. 3.
mention in this case.

If you would have some Examples of Adoring Christ with divine worship, in the
Mystery of the Eucharist, by celebrating the manner of his death, (as Hierom
may be said to have adored at Jerusalem, Christ in his Crach; or as every
Christian does in the Mystery of Baptism) we could store you with multitudes:
but of Adoring the Eucharist, with a proper Invocation of Christ himself
therein, we have not as yet received from you any one.

CHAP. IV.
That the Divine Adoration of the Sacrament is thrice Repugnant to the
Judgment of Antiquity.

First by their Silence.

SECT. I.
YOU are not to require of us, that we produce the express Sentences of
ancient Fathers, condemning the Ascribing of Divine honor to the Sacrament;
seeing that this Romish Doctrine was neither in Opinion nor Practice in their
times. It ought to satisfy you, that your own most zealous, indefatigable,
subtle, and skillful Miners, digging and searching into all the Volumes of
Antiquity, which have been extant in the Christian world for the space of six
or seven hundred years after Christ, yet have not been able to extract from
them any proof of a Divine honor, as due to this Sacrament, either in
express words, or practice; insomuch that you are enforced to obtrude only
such Sentences, and Acts, which equally extend to the honoring of the
Sacrament of Baptism, and other sacred things, whereunto (even according to
your own Romish Profession) Divine honor cannot be attributed without gross
Idolatry: and never there the less have your Disputers not spared to call such
their Objections Clear Arguments, piercing, and unsoluble.

We therefore make bold hereupon to knock at the Consistory door of the
conscience of every man, endued with any small glimpse of Reason, and to
entreat him, for Christ's sake, whose Cause it is, to judge between Rome and
Us, after he has heard the case, which stands thus; Divine Adoration of the
Host is held to be, in the Romish Profession, the principal practique part of
Christian Religion.

Next, the ancient Fathers of the Church were the faithful Registers of
Catholic Truth, in all necessary points of Christian Faith, and Divine
Worship. They in their writings manifoldly instructed their Readers by
Exhortations, Admonitions, Persuasions, and Precepts how they are to demean
themselves in the receiving of this Sacrament; not omitting any Act, whereby to
set forth the true Dignity, and Reverence belonging unto it; many of the same
Holy Fathers sealing that their Christian Profession with their Blood. It is
now referred to the Judgment of every man, whether it can fall within his
capacity to think it Credible, that those Fathers, if they had been of the
now Romish Faith, would not have expressly delivered, concerning the due Worship
of this Sacrament, this one word consisting but of two Syllables [viz. Divine]
for direction to all Posterity, to adore the Sacrament with divine honor, even
as it is taught in the Church of Rome at this day: and to have confirmed the
same by some Practice, not of one or other private man or woman, but by their
public form of Prayer, and Invocation in their soleme Masses; or else to
confess, that Antiquity never fancied any Divine Adoration of the Eucharist.

Yet two words more. You press the point of the Invocation of the Sacrament
more urgently and vehemently than any other: and we indeed believe that the
ancient Fathers (if they had held, according to the now Roman Church, a
Corporal presence of Christ) would never have celebrated any Mass without an
express Invocation of him, as in your now-Roman Mass we find it done,
saying, O Lamb of God, etc. or some other like form. Yet know now that your
own learned Pamelius has published two large Tomes of all the Masses in the
Latin Church, from Pope Clemens down to Pope Gregory (containing the compass
of six hundred years) we say, Latin Missals above forty in number; in all
which, upon our once reading, we presume to say that there is not one such
tenor of Invocation at all. This our first Reason, taken from so universal a
silence of ancient Fathers, in a case of so necessary a moment, may be (we
think) satisfactory in it self to any man of ordinary Reason. Our second
Objection out of the Fathers follows.

That the Ancient Fathers gainsaid the Corporal presence of Christ in this
Sacrament, and Adoration thereof, by their Preface, in their presenting the
Host, saying, Lift up your Hearts.

SECT. II.
IT was the general Preface of Antiquity, used in the Celebration of this
Sacrament, for the Minister to say, [Lift up your Hearts,] and the People to
Answer, [We lift them up unto the Lord.] This [Sursum Cord^] Calvin. Instit.
lib. 2. cap. 17.. 36. Nec alia causa in antiqua Ecclesia fuisse institutum, ut
ante myster^orum celebrationem diceretur, [Sursum corda.]
Calvin has objected against you; and your Cardinal confessing that This
Preface In omnibus Liturgiis Graecis Jacobi, Basilii, Chrysostom. Et omnibus
Latinis habetur id, quod etiam hoc tempore nos facimus, Bellarm. lib. (...). de
Euch. cap. 14.. Respondeo si.
was in use in all Liturgies of Antiquity, as well Greek as Latin, and
continued in the Church of Rome unto this day; Then answers that Respondeo
[Sur^um corda] non significare e^evationem ad ^ocum corporalem, sed elevationem
a rebus terrenis and curis hujus vitae, ad Deum and res aeternas. Non
respondetur, Habemus ad firmamentu^, sed [Habemus ad Dominum.] Et certe qui
Christum quaerebant in praesepi, in templo, in sepulchro, Sursum corda
habebant, quia illum quaerebant, qui est super omnia Deus benedictus in secula.
-- Et fieri potest ut qui terram intuetur, cor deorsum -- Sic qui in
Eucharistia Christum quaerunt and venerantur, cor sursum habent, si de ipso
Christo, non de negotiis hujus vitae interim cogitent. Bellarm. Ibid.
He that seeks Christ, in the Eucharist and worshippeth him, if he think of
Christ, and not of the Cares of earthly things, he has his heart above. So he.
As though the word [Above] meant, as the Object, the person of Christ in the
Eucharist, and not his place of Residence in the highest Heavens; contrary to
the word in the Greek Liturg. Grac. [(...)]
Liturgies, which is [(...)] Above, wherein the Church alludeth to that [(...)]
of the Apostle, Colos. 3. 1. Seek the things that are above, where Christ is
at the right hand of God, as your own Monet ergo Sacerdos populum [Sursum] i.
e. super se^p^um elevar^co^da ad Dominum, juxta exhortationem Apostoli, Col. 3.
Quae sursum sunt quaerite, non quae super terram. Durand. Rat^n. lib. 4. cap.
33.
Durandus, the Expositor of the Romish Mass, does acknowledge. Saint Augustine
saying, Aug. in Psalm. 148. [Laudate Dominum in excelsis.] Primo de c^lo dicit,
postea de t^rris, lauda^ur enim Deus, quifecit coelum and terram. Nos adhoc in
imo sumus, sed cum cogitamus quomodo illic laudetur Deus, ^oribi habeamus: and
non sin^ causa audimus [Sursum corda.]
It is not without Cause, that it is said, Lift up your hears; He shows the
Cause to be, that we, who are here at the Bottom, might (according to that of
the Psalmist) Praise God in the highest.

This, one would think, is plain enough, but that is much more, which we have
already proved out of the Fathers, by their Antithesis, and Opposition ^etweene
the Altar on Earth, and the other in Heaven; where we have heard S^e abo^e,
Bo^ke 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 8, etc.
Chrysostom distinguishing them that fasten their thoughts upon this Below,
from Them that seek Christ in Heaven, as he does Choughs from Eagles. Ambrose,
as they that behold the Image, from them that contemplate upon the Tra^h. Ibid.
Nazianzene, as they that look upon the Signs, from them that see the Things.
And the Council of Book 4. Chap. 10. Sect. 1.
Nice, as they that stoop down, from them that look up aloft. And we may not
forget the Observation which Book 5.
Athanasius made of Christ in his discourse of Eating his flesh, and drinking
his Blood: purposely making mention of his Ascension into Heaven, thereby to
draw their thoughts from earthly Imaginations, and to consider him as being in
Heaven.

Cyril of Jerusalem is a Father whom you have often solicited to speak for
your Cause in other Cases, but all in vain; shall we hearken to him in this?
He interpreting these words [Lift up your Hearts,] will not have it only to
signify a sequestring of your thoughts from earthly Cares to spiritual and
heavenly (which you say was the meaning of the Council of Nice, as if that
Lifting up their hearts had been only an exercising of their thoughts upon
that in the hands of the Priest, or on the Altar beneath,) No, but he says
that it is Cyril. Hier. C^tech. Mystag. 5. Ob hanc causam ^lamat Sacerdos
[(...)] quia opo^tet sursum habere cor, (...), and non ad terrena negotia
deprimere; Paulo post, 19. (...).
To have our hearts in Heaven with God the lover of mankind: even as did also
Aug. in Psalm. 85. Certe recte admoner, ut Sursum corda habeant: audiant igitur
and faciant, levent ad coelum* quod male est in terra: ibi enim non putrescit
cor, si levetur ad Deum. Test Pamel. Tom. 1. Missal. in Missa Aug. Hippo^ens.
page 527.
S. Augustine interpret this Admonition to be A lifting up of hearts to Heaven.
Whom as you have See above, Book 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 8.
heard leaving our Eucharisticall Sacrifice on this Altar, so would he have us
to seek ^or our Priest in Heaven; namely, as Origin more expressly said, Not on
earth, but in Heaven: accordingly Oecumenius, placing the Host and Sacrifice
where Christ's Invisible Temple is, even in Heaven.

Will you suffer one, whom the world knows to have been as excellently
versed in Antiquity as any other, to determine this point? He will come home
unto you; Tempore veteris Ecclesiae Romanae populus non cursitabat ad videndum
id quod Sacerdos ostendit, sed prostratis humi corporibus, animis in coelum
erectis, gratias agebant Redemptori. Eras. lib. de amab. Eccles. Concord.
In the time of the Ancient Church of Rome (says he) the people did not run
hither and thither to behold that which the Priest does show, bu^ prostrating
their Bodies on the ground, they lift up their minds to Heaven, giving thanks
to their Redeemer. So he. Thus may we justly appeal, as in all other Causes of
moment, so in this, from this degenerate Church of Rome to the sincere Church
of Rome, in the primitive times; like as one is reported to have appealed from
Caesar sleeping to Caesar waking. Our difference then can be no other than was
that between Mary and Stephen, noted by Ambrose, Ambros. in Luc. cap. 24.
Maria, quae quaerebat Christum in terra, tangere non potuit: Stephanus tetigit,
qui quaesivit in coelo.
Mary, because she sought to touch Christ on earth, could not; but Stephen
touched him, who sought him in Heaven. A third Argument follows.

That the Ancient Fathers condemned the Romish worship by their Descriptions of
Divine Adoration.

SECT. III.
ALL Divine Adoration of a mere Creature is Idolatry; hereunto accord these
sayings of August. Tom. 2. Epist. 44. ad Maxim. Christianis Catholicis nihil ut
nume^ adoratur, quod conditum est a Deo. Idem Tom. 8. ^n Psalm 98. Timeo terram
adorare, ne me d^mn^t qui fecit coelum and terram. Nazianz. Orat. 31. Ei (...).
Antiquity: No Catholic Christian does worship, as a Divine Power, that which
is created of God. Orthus, I fear to worship Earth, lest he condemn me, who
created both Heaven and Earth. Or thus, If I should worship a Creature, I could
not be named a Christian. It were a tedious superfluity, in a matter so
universally confessed by yourselves, and all Christians, to use Witnesses
unnecessarily. We add the Assumption. But the Romish Adoration of the
Sacrament is an attributing of Divine Honor to a mere Creature, Bread. For
that it is still Bread, you shall find to have been the Doctrine of Primitive
Fathers, if you shall but have the patience to stay until we deliver unto you
a See Book 8. Chap. 1. Sect. 3.
Synopsis of their Catholic Judgment herein; after that we have duly examined
your Romish Doctrine by your own Principles, which is the next point.

CHAP. V.
An Examination of Romish Adoration of the Sacrament in the Mass, to prove it
Idolatrous, by discussing your own Principles.

The State of the Question.

IDolatry, by the Distinction of your Jesuits, is either Material, or
Formal. The Material you call that, when the Worshipper adoreth something in
stead of God, in a wrong persuasion that it is God; otherwise you judge the
worship to be a formal Idolatry. Now because many of your seduced Romanists
are persuaded that your Romish worship, in your Mass, cannot be subject either
to Material or Formal Idolatry, it concerns us in Conscience, both for the
honor of God, and safety of all that fear God, to prove both. We begin at
that which you confess to be a Material Idolatry.

That the Romish Adoration of the Host in the hand of the Priest, is
necessarily a Material Idolatry, by reason of many hundred confessed Defects:
whereof Seven concern the Matter of the Sacrament.

SECT. I.
IT is a point unquestionable among you, that if the thing, in the hand of the
Priest, be not duly Consecrated, then the matter Adored is but a mere
Creature; and your Adoration must needs be, at the least, a material Idolatry.
The Seven defects, set down in your Roman Missal. Romans page 31. Ubi debita
materia deficit, non conficitur Sacramentum -- Si non sit panis triticcus, vel
fi alioqui corruptus. Et page 32. Si vinum sit factum acetum, vel penitus
putidum, vel de uvis acerbis and non maturis expressum, vel admixtum aquae, ut
sit corruptum, non conficitur Sacramentum.
Missall, and by your Dico, species consecratae perfect^ misceri possunt cum
liquore specie distincto, and tum non manet ^ub eis sanguis Christi. Ita
Thomas. Test Suar. Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 67.. 4.. Dico. Et Durand. Si plus
apponatur aquae quam vini, erit irritum Sacramentum. Lib. 4. cap. 42.
Jesuit, are these; First, If the Bread be not of Wheat; or secondly, Be
corrupt; or thirdly, the Wine be turned Vinegar; or fourthly, of sour; or
fifthly, unripe Grapes; or sixthly, be stinking, or imperfectly mixed with any
liquor of any other kind, the Consecration is void: so that neither Body or
Blood of Christ can be there present; seventhly, yea, and if there be more
Water than Wine. So you. All which Defects how easily they may happen, beyond
the understanding of every Consecrating Priest, let Bakers and Vintners judge.

That there are Six other Missal. Romans in Can. Missae. Sex modis contingere
potest formae variatio (nimirum) per Additionem, detractionem, alicujus vocis
mutationem, vel si una ponatur loco alterius, corruptionem vocis alicuj^s,
detrahendo vel mutando syllabam aliquam, transpositionem, i. e. ordini^
dictionu^ variationem, ac deinde per interruptionem, ut pronuntiando unam
partem formae, ac quiescendo per aliquod spatium, velloqu^^do aliquid
impertinens. Minima variatio destruit integritatem substantial^m, si per^at
sensus. Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram. in Genesis c. 21.. Secunda Prop -- Sacramenta
rata non sunt, si dum conferuntur unum tantum verbum, quod ad substantiam
pertiner, omittatur: imo si uniu^ syllabae omissio sensum verboru^ mutaverit,
a^t corruperit, collatum Sacramentum non valet: ut si Sacerdos dixerit, Hoc est
Cor meum, pro [Corpus meum.] Azor. Ies. Instit. Moral. Tom. 1. lib. 5. cap.
28.. Animadvert. -- [Hoc est, etc.] Si quis diminueret aliquid, aut immutaret
de forma Consecrationis, vel aliquid addat, quod significationem mutaret, non
conficeret Sacramentum. Missal. Romans page 33. Haec sunt necessaria necessitate
Sacramenti, quibus sublatis, tolli^ur Sacramentum, ut nimirum non peccet
Sacerdos corrumpendo verba Consecrationis. Item Alan. de Sacram. ^n Genesis cap.
21.
confessed Defect's, incident to either Element in the Eucharist, which may
hinder the Consecration; and necessarily infer an Idolatrous Adoration, in
respect of the form of Consecrating.

SECT. II.
AS thus; If the Priest fail in Pronunciation of these words [Hoc est corpus
meum:] or in these, Hic est calix sanguinis mei: novi, and aeterni Testamenti:
mysterium fidei: qui pro vobis, and pro multis effundetur in remissionem
peccatorum. Which your Roman Missall, and Doctors say may happen, in either of
both, six manner of ways: first, by Addition; or secondly, by Omission;
thirdly, by Mutation, and Change of any one Syllable, which may alter the sense
of the speech; fourthly, by Interruption of voice, and by too long pausing in
uttering of the words; fifthly, by Corruption of any word; sixthly, by some
Interposition of words between, which are impertinent. Each one of these
faults, (say you) concerning either Element, does so disannull the
Consecration, that The thing Adored is still but Bread and Wine, and therefore
the worship thereof must be a material Idolatry. So you.

And how easy it is for the Priest (that we may use your own Examples) to
say, Hoc est Cor meum; or, Hoc est Cor-pus; or, Meum corpus est; or, Hic Erit
Calix; or, as the Tale goes of a Priest, who (having many Hosts before him to
be Consecrated, lest he might err in his Grammar, in using the singular number
for the plural) Consecrated in these words, Agrippa. Sicut nattatur de
Sacrificulo, sive verum, sive fabula sit, qui cum plures haberet Hostias, (...)
Grammaticam omitteret, in haec verba consecravit, Haec sunt corpora mea.
Devani^. Scient. cap. 3.
Haec sunt corpora mea; These are my Bodies: we say for the possibility of
these and the like Lapses (beside this last from the want of wit) the manifold
infirmities of man's speech, either upon Amazement, or Temulency, or Temerity
and negligence, or imperfection of a Stammering tongue, can give you a shrewd
guess.

That there are Four other confessed kind of Defects, in respect of the
Priest's Intention, whereby the Consecration being hindered, the Romish
Adoration must needs be materially Idolatrous.

SECT. III.
AS for Example, first, Bellarm. Si Sacerdos ^ingit se consecrare, cum non
consecrat, Christus abest. -- Nisi intentio Ministri sit saltem virtualis,
animo faciendi quod facit Ecclesia, non est Consecratio. De Sacram. in Genesis
cap. 27. Si quis non intendit con^icere, nisi delusorie aliquid agere. Missal.
Romans page 33. -- Vel ex oblivio^, cum hostia aliqua lateat, cum non intendit
consecrare nisi quas videt. Vel si habe^s coram se undecim hostias, and
intendet consecrare december, non determinan^ quas december intendit, non consecrat,
quia requiritur I^tentio. Missal. ibid.
If the Priest in Consecrating (says your Cardinal) have no intention to
consecrate at all; or (to speak from your Romish Missall it self) secondly,
If his virtuall Intention in consecrating be not to do a^ the Church does; or
thirdly, If he should consecrate but in mockery; or fourthly, He having more
Hosts before him, than he is ware of; if he intend to Consecrate fewer than
there is before him, and yet not knowing which of them all to omit. Of the
Easines of all these Defects, the possibility of retchlesnesse, of infidelity,
of mockery, and of obliviousnesse in some Priests may sufficiently
prognosticate; each of which infers a confessed Material Idolatry.

That there are Six other Defects able to frustrate the Consecration, by reason
of the person of the Priest himself, as being incompetent for want of due
Baptism.

SECT. IV.
FOr first you have a Decret. lib. 13. Tit. 43. C. 3. Veniens ad gradum
Sacerdotii, camperit tande quod non fit baptizat^s, rite fecimus ipsum
baptizari.
Case of one being a Priest, who had not been baptized; and next concerning
Defects of Baptism, you resolve (as before of pronunciation of the form of
the Eucharist) Bellarm. -- Vel una litera. De Sacram. in Genesis cap. 25.. Secunda
Prop. -- Haec sunt nece^saria necessitate Sacramenti, ut nim^rum non peccet
Sacerdos corrumpendo verba Consecrationis: ut in Baptismo si quis dicat,
Baptizo te in nomine Matris, etc. Ala^. ^ard. de Sacram, in Genesis cap. 21. And
Azorius, See above, Sect. 2. lit. (c).
that if in pronunciation of the words of Baptism [Baptizo te in nomine
Patris, Filii, and Spiritus Sancti] the Minister (whether man or woman) shall
vary one word, which may corrupt the true sense of the words, although but in
one Syllable, or Letter, be it either by adding, removing, changing, or by any
of the six Defects (already spoken of) as in saying, Ego te baptizo in nomine
Patriae, etc. or the like, then the whole Consecration is of no effect. The
possibility of women's erring, in their Ministry of Baptism, Cardinal Pole
may seem to teach in that his Article, whereof it is inquired, M. Fox his Acts
and M^m. page 1969.
Whether Parsons, Vicars, and Curates be diligent in teaching women to Baptize
Children after the manner of the Church.

Take with you another Case, supposed by your selves, the Cos^ Philiarch. de
offic. Sh^erd. Tom. 1. lib. 1. C. 14. Potest dari casus, sicut audivi datum
esse, quod ^ilius alicujus nobilis sit a levatrice baptizarus aqua rosacea,
quia est silius nobilis, etc.
Author delivers it at length, the brief is this: The woman baptizeth an
Infant, because it as the Child of a noble man, in Rose Water, the Baptism is
void; the Child is afterward ordained a Bishop, and he is after that sent by
the Pope into diverse parts of the world, and by him innumerable Priests are
ordained; after the death of the Bishop, the case is made known, but who they
were that had been ordained cannot possibly be known, whose Ordinations are
all invalid, and their ministry and Consecrations of no effect. What remedy
now in this Case? None (says the Author) at all, except there be a Privilege
in the Pope to constitute all them Priests, who had been so irregularly
ordained, only by his word, Dicendo sint Sacerdotes, saying, Be they all
Priests. So he, who notwithstanding had rather think the Case could not
possibly happen, than to trust to this Remedy. How-ever it might be in this
one, the possibility of the other Six Defects neither man nor woman can deny,
every one concluding a Material Idolatry.

That there are manifold confessed possible Defects, disabling the person of
the Priest to consecrate, in respect of his no-due Ordination; whereby is
occasioned a Material Idolatry.

SECT. V.
YOU have furthermore See the pr^ceding Sect. in the Margent.
confessed, that, for want of due Ordination of the Priest, the Sacrament
remains in his former nature only of Bread, and Wine; as if he be an
Incruder, and not ordained at all: or else of the form of Ordination, viz.
[Accipe potestatem offerendi Sacrificium: Et Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, quorum
peccata remiseris, remissa, etc.] As if it has been corrupted, by missing so
much as one Syllable, or letter, by Addition, Detraction, or any of the six
Errors before rehearsed; as Accipe Spiritu Sancto, for Spiritum Sanctum; or,
Accipe potestatem ferendi Sacrificium, for Offerendi; or the like.

That there are many hundred confessed Defects, which may nullisic the
Consecration, to make the Romish Adoration Idolatrous, in respect of
Insufficiencies, which might be incident unto the Prae-ordainers of that
Priest, whosoever he be, that now consecrateth; for causing a Material
Idolatry.

SECT. VI.
IF the Si de^icit o^d^ Sacerdotalis in conficiente, non consicitur
Sacramentum, Missal, Romans page 31.
Bishop that ordained this Priest, which now consecrateth, were not a true
Priest himself, truly ordained, or duly baptized; or else the next Bishop
before him, or yet any one in the same line of Ordainers, until you come to
Saint Peter, for the space now of a thousand six hundred years, whereof your
Jesuit says; Multae sunt causae propter quas non potest accidere, ut Christus
non sit prae^ens: ut ^i Sacerdos non sit baptizatus, vel non sit rite
ordinatus, quod pendet ex multis aliis Causis, quibus ^er^ in infinitum
progredi possumus; ut ex part materiae saepe accidit defectus. Suarez Ies. in
3. Thom. qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 65.. 2.
The Defect of Ordination is seen in many Cases, wherein, Progredi possumus
fere in Infinition (that is) we may proceed almost infinitely. So he. Thinking
belike that if we should in this number of years allow unto every Bishop
ordaining the continuance of twenty years Bishop upward to Saint Peter, the
number of them all would amount to fourscore Bishops; among whom if any one
were an Intruder, or Vnordained, then this Priest fails in his Priesthood.
Now of these kinds your Plena sunt illa tempora Ordinationibus Paparum,
Exordinationibus, Superordinationibus. Baron. An. 908. number. 3. and Ann. 897.
number. 6, and 8. and Ann. 900. number. 6 Platina in vita Ioh. 10. sol. 146. and in
vita Sergii 3. sol. 148.
Historians afford us Examples of your Popes, some dissolving the Ordinations
of their Predecessors, even to the cutting off of one Platina in vi^a St^ph. 6.
de F^rmoso; Abscissis duobus dextrae illius digitis, poti^^imum eis, quibus
Sacerdotes in Consecratione utuntur.
Popes fingers, wherewith he had used to consecrate.

Yet is not this all, for unto these are to be added the other Defects, to wit,
want of Baptism, whether for want of due Intention, being three; or undue
Pronunciation, being six; or the Errors either of Intention or Pronunciation in
Ordination, all which make eighteen: and these being multiplied by fourscore
(which is the number of Bishop-ordainers from this Bishop to Saint Peter) the
total (we suppose) will amount unto a Thousand possible Defects, each one
whereof, if it happen, does quite frustrate and annull the Consecration of this
Priest, whosoever he be, that now says Mass; and leaves to the people
nothing but the substance of the Creatures of Bread and Wine to be Adored in
stead of Christ Jesus, the Son of God. And yet in this Sum are not reckoned
the foresaid Defects concerning the Matter, or Form of Consecration, or of the
Priests Intention therein, or else of his possible Intrusion into this Function
of Consecrating of this one Priest, now supposed to be ordained; every Defect
being of force in it self to infer necessarily a Material Idolatry in your
Romish Mass.

Now rather than you shall call these our Instances odious or malicious, you
must accuse your own Romish Church, because we have alleged no Testimony, but
out of your own public Romish Missall, Cardinal's, Jesuits, and other
Authors privileged in your Church. We are now in the high point of Christian
Religion, even the principal part of God's Royalty, Divine Adoration, not to
be trifled withal. Therefore now, if ever, show your selves conscionable
Divines, by freeing your Romish Mass from a Formal Idolatry in these
forenam'd Respects, concerning your confessed Material Idolatry; and do it by
some grounds of Truth, or else abandon your Profession as most damnably
Idolatrous.

CHAP. VI.
That the Romish Masse-worship is a Formal Idolatry, notwithstanding any
Pretense that by your Romish Doctors has been made to the Contrary.

The State of the Question.

SECT. I.
Upon this occasion, oh! how your Summists, Theologues, and Casuists do
bestirre themselves for the vindicating of your Church from the guilt of
formal Idolatry? The Brief of your Defense is this: Bellarm. Vbi deest vera
Consecratio, nullum est periculum in co, qui bona fide Sacramentum adorat,
adoratio enim potissimum ex intention pendet; quare sicut is, qui panem non
consecratum inju^ia aff^ceret, putans consecratum esse, gravissime peccasset in
Christum: sic etiam contra qui panem eundem adorat, quod certo credat non esse
panem, sed Christu^, is proprie and formaliter Christum adorat, non panem. Lib.

Although (say they, in the Margent) there be no true Consecration, by reason
of diverse Defects, yet in him who upon a Moral certainty, with a sincere mind
and good intention, does adore Bread, it is but Material, and no Formal
Idolatry, so that he have an habitual condition, as being so disposed in his
mind, not to give a divine honor unto it, if he knew it to be but Bread. As
for Example; He that gives an Alms to a Rich man, being probably persuaded
that he is not rich, the Act proceeds from a pious Intention. And, As it was
no sin in Jacob to lie with Leah, because he thought her to be his wife; so
in this case it is no formal Idolatry to worship Bread, being morally
persuaded that it is Christ. Thus they.

Your Pretenses then are three; Moral Certainty, Good Intent, and (at least)
Habitual Condition. But alas! all this is but sowing Fig Leaves together,
which will never be able to cover your foul shame of gross Idolatry. To begin
first with that which you call Moral Certainty.

That the Pretense of Moral Certainty of worshipping of Bread, instead of
Christ, cannot free the Romish Church from Formal Idolatry.

SECT. II.
OUR Confutation is grounded upon diverse impregnable Reasons, one whereof is
taken from the Iealouzie of God in his worship; the second from the Faith
required in a true worshipper; the third from the nature of an Oath; and the
last from the Uncertainty of that which you call Moral Certainty.

First then, although Moral and Conjecturall persuasions might excuse men's
Actions in diverse Cases, yet in an Object of Divine Worship it is utterly
condemnable, even because of the Jealousy of the Almighty, who expresses
himself to be a Jealous God, Exodus 20. signifying, as Ego sum Deus t^us fortis
Zelo^es, Exodus 20 5.] Dicitur Deus Zelo^es, id est, zelum tenens: zelus autem
est amor prvatus, nolens habere consortium in amato. Et ^ic viri dicuntur
habere zelum de uxoribus suis, quia volunt quod uxo^es suae solos illos ament,
and solis illis copulentur. Sic etiam Deus volebat quod Judaei ^um solum
co^erent, and ^um ut Deum cognoscerent: and quando alius coleretur (...) Deus,
dolebat, tanquam ^i vir videat uxor^ suam amantem alium virum. Et ^icut cum
mu^er alteri quam viro suo copulatur, fornicari dicitur: ita qui alterum quam
verum Deum colebat, fornicari dicebatur in Scriptura cum Diis alienis. Abulens.
in Exodus 20. page 273. col 2.
you know, that He will not endure any confort in his worship; his Motto being
this, I am, and there is no Other: even as in the Case of mortal Majesty, when
as a subject, building upon a moral Certainty only, shall question the Title
and Right of his Sovereign established in his Throne, he becomes guilty of
High Treason.

Secondly, all Divine Worship must be performed with a Divine Faith, which is
an Infallible persuasion of the Godhead of that which we honor as God, as it
is written: He that comes to God, must believe that God is, Heb. 11. 6. and
again, You must ask in faith, nothing doubting, Iac. 1. because this is the
nature of Faith, as the Apostle describes it; Faith is the Hyposta^is of
things not seen, Heb. 11. That is, (to take your Grae ci optime interpretantur
Hypostasin per substantiam, quia fides efficit ut ea, quae credit, non m^nus
c^rta habeamus, quam si subsisterent. Ribera Ies. Co^ Heb* 11. page 514.
own Comment) Faith makes those things, which are believed, no less certain
than if they did subsist, whereby we are taught both the nature and necessity
of Faith in Divine Worship. But Moral and Conjecturall Certainty is not
Hypostasis, which impli^th an Infallibility of Truth, but an Hypothesis, and
supposition of that which may be otherwise, and has in it nothing but
Uncertainty at all; of which more Chap. 9. Sect. 4.
hereafter.

Thirdly, God himself commands his people by his Prophet, saving, Thou shall
worship me, and (in Sep^^agints.
Greek, (...)) shall swear by my Name. Swearing then is an Adoration, by
Invocating of God; and his own peculiar Prerogative. Hearken now. By this Law
of God, none may swear by any thing, as God, which he dare not swear is God:
But your Romish Professors, in your Mass, Invocate this Sacrament thus,
Sacerdos inclinatus Sacramento, junctis manibus, and ter pectus percutiens,
dicit, Agnus Dei, qui ^ollis peccata mundi, mis^r^re nobis. Et rursus, Agnus
Dei, etc. M^ssal. Romans page 24. Rursus. Inclinato capite versus Sacramentum,
dicit intelligibili voce, Da nobis pacem: E^rursus secret, Domine Jesu
Christ, etc. Missal. Rom ibid.
O Lamb of God, which take away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us.
And what Romish Professor is there who swears not by the Mass (meaning the
Consecrated Host) as by Christ himself? Notwithstanding, no one of your Romish
Priests (by reason of the manifold Defects incident thereunto, as you have
heard) durst eversweare that this, which is now Consecrated by him on the
Altar, is not substantially Bread, or that it is the Body of Christ. It must
therefore follow, that your Adoration having no better Certainty, than (as you
have confessed) to adore it with an [if it be Christ,] is a faithless
profanation of the name of the Son of God, and of his worship. This point,
concerning Faith in every Worshipper, will be confessed Thorow-out the 7.
Chapter.
afterward.

In the last place (that we may ruinate the very foundation of your Excuse)
your Pretense of Moral Certainty comes to be examined, which you have
exemplified by one giving an Alms to a poor man, who peradventure has no
need; and of Jacobs lying ignorantly with her that was not his wife. These, say
we, are Cases far different from this which we have in hand, because God's
Almoner (you know) is not bound to enquire of a man, whom he sees to appear
to be miserable and poor, whether he be a Counterfeit or no; for Charity is
not suspicious, says the Apostle Saint Paul. Jacob, indeed, was bound to know
only his own wife, but if he had had any probable or Moral Cause of doubt,
would that holy Patriarch (think you) have been so deluded, or overreached a
second, and a third time, to defile his Body by an unchaste Bed? But the Causes
of your Doubtings are set forth and numbered by Threes, Sixes, Twenties,
Hundreds, until you come to a Thousand, and (as your Jesuit has said) Almost
infinite Defects. For indeed if there be (as appears) a Thousand hazards in
every Mass of any one Priest, then in two Priests, as many more, and so
forward; so that if one should hear in his time the Masses of Ten, and Twenty
Priests, what multitudes of thousands of Defects would the reckoning make? But
we need say no more, than has already been confessed of Almost infinite, and
(consequently) as many Doubts of an Idolatrous worship; wherein there cannot be
so much Moral Certainty, as that, in any one generation of men from Christ's
time, each one of that offspring has been chastely borne, whereunto what
Christian is there that dare be sworn?

CHALLENGE.
COnsider (we beseech you, for God's Cause, for we are now in the Cause of God)
whether our God, who will be known to be transcendently Jealous of his own
Honor, would ever ordain such a worship of a Sacrament, whereby men must
needs be still more obnoxious to that, which you call a Material Idolatry, by
many hundredfold, than possibly any can be to any material Parricide, or
material Murder, or material Adultery, or any other heinous and material
Transgression, that can be named under the Sun. Thus much of your first
Pretense for this present, until we come to receive the Sea Chap. 7. thorowout.
Confessions of your own Doctors in this very point.

That the Second Romish Pretense, which is of a Good Intent, cannot free your
Adoration of the Host from Formal Idolatry.

SECT. III.
LET us hear your Cardinal; Bellarm. Sicut is, qui panem non consecratum
injuria afficeret, etc. See above, Sect. 1. (a).
Honor (says he) depends upon the Intention, so that as he, who should
contemptuously abuse the unconsecrated Bread, thinking it to be Conserated,
should grievously offend Christ; contrariwise he, who certainly believing the
Bread to be Christ's Body, shall Adore the same, does principally and formally
Adore Christ, and not the Bread. So he, even with the same Sophistry, from only
such a seeming Contrariety, wherewith you use to plead for Merits: (to wit) if
evil works deserve damnation, then good works deserve eternal life. But will
you be pleased to hear the same Cardinal speak in earnest, from the
Principles of true Logic? Mala intentio vitiat opus: sed perperam inde
colligitur opera mala ex intention bona justificari. Nam opus bonum nascitur
ex integra causa, malum autem ex quovis defectu oriri potest. Bellarm. de
amiss. Great. lib. 2. cap. 4.. Primum enim.
Although an evil Intention does vitiate and corrupt an Act otherwise good,
yet it follows not that a good intent should justify an evil Act, because
no Act is good, except all the Causes thereof be good; but any Act is evil
upon any one Defect. So he; which his Conclusion is held as universally true in
all Schools, whether Christian, or Heathen, as any point of Morality can be.
Wherefore it follows not, that because a man does something to the Contempt
of Christ, in abusing that which he thinks to be Christ, that therefore the
honor, which he does to that, which he falsely believes to be Christ, should
be an Adoration of Christ: as all Heathenish Idolatry, in worshipping stocks
and stones, in an opinion of adoring the true God, do witness to the world,
as your own Chap. 7, and 8.
Confessions will confirm.

CHALLENGE.
DO you not perceive what a patched Cloak of Sophistry your Cardinal cast
upon your Good Intent, in your Adoration, to cover the filthiness thereof, if
it might be? and how by another Position he rent the same in pieces, when he
had done? Again, you stand thus far, furthermore, condemnable in your selves
in this point, whilst as you seek to free your Adoration from Idolatry, by
Pretense of a Good Intent; and notwithstanding hold a Good Intention not to be
sufficient thereunto, except it be qualified and formed with an habitual
Condition, which is your Third and last Pretense; as fond and false as either
of the former.

That the Third Romish Pretense of an Habitual Condition, in the Worshipper,
excuses him not from formal Idolatry; proved first by Scripture.

SECT. IV.
Habitual Condition you have interpreted to stand thus; See above, Sect. 1. at
the letter (a) ad ^nem.
If he that chances to worship only Bread be in that Act so disposed in
himself, that he would not worship the same Bread, as Christ, if he knew it
were but Bread, and not Christ; and by this you teach, that the Act (which you
call a material Idolatry) is made not only excusable but (your own Ibid.
words) honest and commendable also. So you. What execrable Doctrine is this
that we hear? which cannot be justifiable except you will justify the
Murderers of the members of Christ; and of Christ himself? First, of the
members of Christ, we read of one Saul, afterward Paul, breathing out
threatenings, and slanders against them, Act. 9. 1. and persecuting the Church,
1 Cor. 15. and Galath. 1. and drawing both men and women to Death, Act. 22. 4.
And all this, not maliciously, but (as you hear himself say) Ignorantly, 1.
Tim. 1. 13. and with a good Conscience, Act. 23. 1. and in zeal, Phil. 3. 6. A
fairer expression of a Good Intent, in a wicked practice, cannot be, than this
was: and as much may be said for his Habitual Condition, namely, that if he
had then (as afterward) known Christ to have been the Lord of life, and
those murdered Christians, to have been his mystical members, he would
rather have exposed himself to Martyrdom, than to have martyred those Saints
of God. This Consequence directly appears, first by his Answer, in his
miraculous Conversion, saying, Acts 9. 5.
Who are thou, Lord? next by his detestation of his fact, 1. Cor. 15. 9.
I am unworthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church, etc.
then by his Acknowledgement of God's especial mercy, 2. Tim. (...). (...).
But God had mercy on me. Afterward by his labor for winning souls to the
Faith: I have labored more abundantly than they all. And lastly, in that he
was one of those Actors, of whom Christ himself foretold, saying, Ioh. 16. 2.
They shall draw you before Judgment seats, and when they shall persecute you,
they will think that they do God good service. Which also plainly argues,
that their and his persuasion of so doing proceeded from a Moral Certainty.

From these Members let us ascend to our Head, Christ the Lord of Glory; what
think you of the Jews? of whom Saint Peter said, You have murdered the
Prince of life, Act. 3. 15. But did they this Voluntarily, and Knowingly, as
understanding him to have been the Red^er of the world, and indeed the Prince
of life? they did not, for the same Apostle testifies in their behalf,
saying, I know you did it ignorantly, as did also your Rulers, Act. 3. 17. If
this be not sufficient, hear the voice of the person that was slain, Christ
himself, who did so far acquit them, saying, They know not what they do,
Luke 23. 34. Ignorantly then in a Conjecturall Certainty, but yet with Good
Intent; of whom Saint Paul witnesses in these words, I bear them witness
that they have the Zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, Romans 10. But
what for habitual Condition? were they not bent in their own minds (if they
had understood what Christ was) to have abhorred that so heinous a guilt of the
death of the Son of God? questionles, for so says the Apostle: If they had
known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory, 1. Cor. 2. 8. We
Conclude, seeing these Jews, notwithstanding their Moral Certainty, (being
seduced by their Priests) or else their Good Intent of doing God good service
therein; or yet their habitual Condition, not to have crucified Christ, if
they had truly known him, were nevertheless by S. Peter condemned, yea and of
themselves, as formal and verily Murderers of Christ; then (o you Romish
worshippers of the Host) must it necessarily follow that in your Masses you
are equally all formally Idolaters, notwithstanding any of the same three
Pretenses to the contrary.

Wherefore, as Solomon speaks of an Adulterous woman; Prove. 30. 20.
She eats, and wipeth her month, saying, I have done no wickedness; so may
we say of Idolatrous Worshippers, and their Proctours: for what else are these
your three Romish Pretenses, but like such mouth-wipers? or as Anodyna, and
stupifying Medicines, which take away the Sense of the diseased person, but do
not cure the disease? So do you delude miserable people with false Pretenses,
lest they, discerning the grossness and ouglinesse of your Idolatry, might
abhor that worship, and abandon your Romish worshippers.

That the former Romish Pretenses have no warrant from Antiquity.

SECT. V.
THe number of Ancient Fathers, whose works are yet extant (who lived within
Six and Seven hundred years after Christ) are recorded to have been about
200. out of whose monuments of Christian learning your chiefest Disputers could
never hitherto produce any one that justified your Romish worship, by so much
as in distinguishing of Material and formal Idolatry; nor yet by qualifying
any Idolatry under pretense of either Moral Certainty, or Good Intent, or yet
Habitual Condition; and therefore must we judge that they never gave Assent to
this your Sorcery. For we may not be so injurious to the memory of so many, so
famously learned, and Catholic Doctors of the Church of Christ, that they
could not; or of persons so holy, and zealous of Gods honor, and of men's
Salvation, that they would not satisfy men's Consciences, to free them out of
thus many and miserable perplexities, wherewith your now Romish Profession of
Adoration of the Host is so Confessed above, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. by your Jesuit
Suarez.
Almost infinitely entangled.

CHAP. VII.
That the Romish Adoration, notwithstanding your former Pretenses, is formally
Idolatrous; proved by four Grounds of Romish Profession.

The first is your Definition of Idolatry.

SECT. I.
DIvine honor ( Honor est testimoninm excellentiae, quod continetur verbo vel
facto, quae de excellentia alicujus convenientem existimationem illi gignit.
Sic honor divinus est quicquid verboruns aut officiorum omnino accommodatum est
ad gignendam existimationem hujusmodi, quae in divinam majestatem proprie
conveniat. Hoc duplici modo, 1. ut opus sit n^tura sua ita praeclarum, ut quis
illud naturali lumine rationis solum Deum tali hono^e dignum esse judicet,
quale est Sacrificium. Alterum, ut tale sit intention ejus, qui vult de
persons, quam honorat, talem existimationem excitare, quae in divinam
majestatem conveniat, licet honor iste alioqui indifferen sit. Greg. Valent.
lib. 2. de Idol. cap. 3.
says your Jesuit Valentia) is whatsoever word or outward office that a man
does perform, whereby he does intend to beget in others such an estimation of
God, unto that which he honors, which is proper unto the Majesty of God. So
that Idolatry is an Error in the understanding (says your Jesuit Est
Idololatria divini cultus erg^falsum Deum exhibitio: colere enim pro Deo eum,
qui non est Deus, aut ipsum laudando, aut e^ aliquo modo prosternendo,
Idololatrare est. -- Idololatria (quae est falsa Adoratio) non est nisi erro^
in intellectu, quo dignum honor judicamus Deum falsum, cui Idololatrase
prosternit. Tolet. Ies. Instit. Sacerd. lib. 4. cap. 24.. Est igitur.
Tolet) in yielding divine worship to that which is not God, whether by
praising, invocating, sacrificing, or prostrating our selves to that which is
not God. In a word, Idolatry comprehends all religious superstition (says
your Jesuit Idololatria comprehendit omnem superstitiosam religionem, qua
quaelibet res colitur pro Deo, Lorinus Ies. in Acts 17. 16.
Lorinus) in worshipping of any thing as God, which is not God. So they, most
Theologically and truly.

CHALLENGE.
NOw apply you these points of your Distinction unto your Host, in the hand of
the Priest, which by your own Confessions may possibly be, and by our proofs
cannot possibly but be (after Consecration) Bread still, whereunto
notwithstanding he prostrateth himself, swears by, and invocateth upon, as
being in it self the person of Christ; the Priest himself saying, Nos
visibili Sacramento invisibilo corpus Christi praesens, adeoque Christumcipsum
invocamus, and quasi divinum quoddam adoramus, and qua^vivum quiddam
ratiorrabile alloquimur, rogamus [O salutaris Hostia, etc.] Espenc. lib. 5. de
Adoras. cap. 8. fol. 185. and ibid. lib. 2. cap. 9. fol. 25.
O holy Host, etc. O Lamb of God, etc. whereby also, according to your
Definition of Idolatry, you your selves do seek to profess, and thereby to
beget in others an opinion of a Godhead in the Sacrament, as whereunto Divine
honor does properly belong. How then can you free your selves from the Crime
of formal Idolatry, by pretense of Ignorance, and error of true knowledge of
the thing falsely adored, seeing that Idolatry (as you your selves have also
defined) is an Error and Ignorance in the judgment of the worshipper? This
were as if one, defining a disease to be a Distemperature of Humors, should
notwithstanding therefore deny a man to be sick, because his humors are
distempered.

II. That Romish Worship is proved to be formally Idolatrous, by Consequence
taken from a Romish Principle, concerning Coadoration, or joynt-worship of
Christ with Bread.

SECT. II.
COadoration is when any thing is worshipped jointly with God in a Divine
Worship, which worship by the Law of God (which says, Thou shall have no other
Gods but me) is perfectly Idolatry, by your own Idololatria est, non solum cum
adoratur Idolum, relicto Deo, sed etiam cum adoratur Idolum simul cum Deo.
Exodus 20. [Deos aureos, and Deos argenteos non facietis mecum.] Bellarm. lib.
2. de Imag. cap. 24.. Praeterea.
Confessions; and, for fear of this kind of Idolatry, your Claudius Saints
Ne Idololatria co^itteretur, air, (nempe Claudius Saints) cum Christo in
Eucharistia debeatur summus divinusque cultus, non est eo Adorationis genere
colendum sensibile continens, quo contentus Jesus. Test Vasquez Ies. de
Adorat. lib. 2. Disp. 8. cap. 11. page 389.
taught that The signs in the Eucharist are not to be adored with the same
honor as Christ is. And that therefore Panis substantiam, post Consecrationem,
abesse probatur, quia si una cum Domini substantia panis sub eisdem
Accidentibus contineretur, periculum e^^et ne^ populus simpliciter adoraret
panem. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 22. initio. Et Alanus lib. 1. de Euch.
cap. 34. Non posse, ait, in Eucharistiae duplicem existere substantiam, quia
Ecclesia esset in summo periculo Idolalatriae, etc. Ratio est, quia cum
adoramus id quod delitescit sub speciebus panis, si esset ib^ adoraremus.
Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 16. page 109. Contendit Claudius Saints ex
unitate Adorationis absentiam substantiae panis colligere: Etenim si duplex
maneret substantia in Sacramento, una panis, altera Christi, non posset citra
Idololatriam unica adoratio in urramque referri. Vasquez Ies. quo sup.
Bread is not to be adored in the Sacrament with Christ's Body, least that the
People, being not able to distinguish the Body of Christ from Bread, should
fall into Idolatry. And the person communicating orally (as you say) the Body
of Christ, now in his mouth, is not to be adored Regularly, but why? Sacramenta
haec in sumente homine, quia quandiu in eo Sacramentaliter sun^ incertum est,
nec regulariter, ^^c ordinary solent adorari. -- Praeceptor meus D. Joh.
Benedictus, magnum Dominicani ordinis ornamentum, docuit, majua esse
Idololatriae periculu^, si Christus adoraretur in homine, quia homo est
subjectum rationis capa^ (honor est autem praemium virtutis) signa vero sacra
non propter se, sed propter res, quas figurant and exhibent, sunt veneranda, in
iis tantum periculi non inest, quam ^i homines peculiari hoc honor propter
sumptum sacramentaliter, and sic aliquandiu Christum in eis habitantem
prosequeremur. Sic eniur homines paulatim Deos esse putaremus. (...) de Euch.
lib. 1. cap. 6. fol. 14.
Because (say you) man being capable of honor, it might fall out, by little
and little, that he should be honored as God. So your own Jesuits and Others.
Yet (not to do you wrong) in this Contemplation Christ, by reason of the
Hypostaticall Union of his Godhead (being no mere Creature) is wholly
excepted: whom we are taught by the Fathers of a General Conc. Ephes^. Tom. 1.
C. 12.. Pari. Neque hominem cum verbo adorandum dicimus, sed unum eu^demque, ne
illud cum verbo aliquam divisionis imaginationem meriti objiciat. Et Tom. 4. C.
26. -- Adoratione vero non seor^ Deum, nec seorsim hominem, sed unum Christum.
Council to adore, not in both his distinct natures, but whole Christ.

CHALLENGE.
WE suppose that there is not any of your own Romish Sect, albeit most
superstitious, who would worship with Divine Worship either the Signs, or the
Appearance of flesh, or the Priest, whiles the Sacrament is in his mouth,
without at least a Moral Persuasion, viz. that he may so do; nor without a
Good intent, viz. that it is well done; nor without habitual Condition, viz.
not to do so, if he knew they were but Signs, Appearance of flesh, or he
merely a Priest. If therefore there be any Idolatry, in adoring any of these
things with Christ, then certainly much rather (which is your Case) is it
Idolatry to worship with Divine Honor, Bread, it being without Christ.

III. That the Romish Worship is proved to be formally Idolatrous in your
Mass, by a Consequence from Romish Doctrine, touching Canonization of Saints.

SECT. III.

Marginals) you shall find that the Common opinion of your Church directs
you to think, that your Church cannot err in this function, and that all
Christians are bound to believe the same; but how? upon a Moral and
Conjecturall persuasion only? No, upon a Divine and infallible Certitude, and
why? Because (say they) if one Saint may be doubted of, then might also the
Canonization of others be called into Question, so that it would be dangerous
to worship any Saint, lest that we should worship a dead and a rotten, instead
of a lively member of Christ: which were an Error pernicious, seeing that every
lie, figment, and falsehood in religious worship must needs be abominable unto
God. So your Archbishop, with others. You will ask, what makes all this to
the Question in hand? give us leave to tell you.

THE same Archbishop Catharinus Catharin. ibid. qu^ supra. Ob. Doctrina haec

Catharin. Petrus de Palude asserit, nullo modo esse dandam Hostiam fimplicem
pro consecrata, quod esset Idololatria: quoniam cum ministratur, etiam adoranda
proponitur. Et Hier. Ferrar. cui quidam objectabat, quod Hostia, per quam
jurabat, non erat consecrata; Cui respondet, si ita fuisset, secisset populum
Idololatrare, atque ideo tanto magis provocaret in se iram Dei. -- Audi, in
hostia consecrata adoratur Christus ut Deus, non simpliciter, sed ut existons
sub his speciebus. Cumigitur ibi non ex^stat Christus, sed creatura pro Christo
invenitur, cui exhibetur Latria, atqu^deo Idololatria est. Idololatrae enim
etiam hac errant ratione, qui coelum (puta) aut aliquid aliud adorabunt,
putantes se ibi adorare Deum, quem a^imam Mundi dicebant, juxta Varronis
Theologiam. Non igitur excusantur ab Idololatria, quod arbitrarentur se unum
Deu^ colere, sicut vere erat unus Deus: sed quod illum ibi adora^ant, ubi non
erat ^o modo, quo esse existimabant. Ibid. page 134, 135.
deduceth a necessity of an infallible assurance of the Canonization of every
Saint, from the Infallibility which ought to be had concerning the Consecration
of the Eucharist, Thus; If the Worshipper may be deceived in adoring the Host,
by mistaking Bread for the Body of Christ, then should it be I dolatry (says
he) as well in the Heathen, who adored Heaven in stead of God. So he. Do you
mark? as well Idolatry, as that of the Heathen; whom neither Moral Certainty,
nor Good Intent, or habitual Condition could ever free from a formal
Idolatry. Our Argument, from your own Confessions, will be this.

Whosoever may be mistaken, in adoring Bread in stead of Christ's Body, may
therein be held as Formal an Idolater as any Heathen. (This is your Bishops
Proposition.) The Assumption. But any man may manifoldly be deceived, in taking
Bread for Christ's Body. (Which has been your general Confession.) Our
Conclusion must be; Therefore any of you may be a Formal Idolater.

IV. That the Romish Worship is proved to be a Formal Idolatry, by the
Consequence used from the Consecration of your Popes.

prove that all men are bound to believe the new Pope, whenever he is
consecrated, to be the true Pope, not only with a Moral or Humane Assurance,
but with a Divine and infallible faith; as were the Jews bound to believe
Christ Jesus, at his coming, to be the true Messiah: that is (says he) with a
faith that cannot possibly be deceived. We have nothing to do with your
Jesuits Position in this place, concerning the Infallibity of Belief of the
Consecration, and Election of your Popes, which we have else where proved to be
a See the Grand Romish Imposture, etc.
Gross Imposture. But we are to argue from his Supposition, as for Example.

grounded his Assertion of an Infallible faith due to be had, touching the
Consecration of your Popes, upon a Supposition; and his Conclusion upon the
like infallible Belief, which men ought to have concerning the Consecration of
the Eucharist, wherein (says he) if there should be any Uncertainty, so that
our faith should depend upon the Intention of the Priest, in like manner might
every one doubt, whether he may adore the Sacrament, as being not truly
consecrated; as also make doubt of the Priest himself, as being not rightly
ordained. So he; who therefore in all these requires a faith infallible. All
these forecited Confessions of your own Divines, as first concerning your
Definition of Idolatry, next in the point of Coadoration of the Creature,
together with the Creator. Thirdly, in your Belief of the ^anonization of
Saints; and lastly, in the Consecration of the Pope, which are but humane
Institutions, do enforce much more a necessity of Infallibility, in every
Adoration instituted by God.

Now among all the Schisms of Anti-Popes, sometimes of two, sometimes of three
at once, and that for forty or fifty years space together, if any one of those
Popes, in his time, had heard any Papist saying to him: you may not be
offended, although I hold your Adversary (as for example Vrbane) to be the true
Pope, and yield to him all Fealty and Obedience, for I do this to a Good
Intent, in a Moral Certainty, that he is truly elected Pope; and in an
habitual Condition, not to acknowledge him, if I knew him not to be Pope,
wherein if I err, it is but a Material Disloyalty; would not the Pope,
notwithstanding all these Pretenses, judge this man to be formally an
Anti-Papist, and pierce him with his Thunderbolt of Anathema, as Popes have
often dealt with Cardinals, Princes, and Emperors in like Case? yet what is
this Glo-wormes slimy shine to the glory of Divine Majesty?

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Romish manner of Adoration, in Comparison with the Heathen.

That the Romish Adoration; by your former Pretenses, justifies the vilest
kind of Idolatry among the Heathen.

SECT. I.
THere is a double kind of Worship, the one is Direct, and terminate, which
pitcheth immediately upon the Creature, without Relation to the Creator, whereof
your Cardinal Alan has resolved, saying; Dicimus ad plenam resolutionem, cum
cultus terminatur ad ipsas creaturas, Idololatriam esse injustam. Alan. de
Sacram. in Genesis cap. 23.
The terminating and fixing of Divine Honor upon any Creature, is a notorious
Idolatry. The second kind is Relative Honor, having Relation to Christ;
whereof your Cardinal Bellarmine has determined, saying, Latria est cultus
Deo proprius, nec per se deferendus imagini, ratione Relationis, Bellarm. lib.
2. de Imag. cap. 24. Tertio. -- Hic cultus, si exhibetur imagini propter se,
est vera Idololatria. Ib.. Dicet. -- Si idem cultus exhibetur imagini propter
aliud, ut aeque colatur creatura atque Deus, certe est Idololatria: nam
Idololatria est non solum cum adoratur Idolum, relicto Deo, sed ctiam cum
adoratur simul cum Deo. Ibid. ^. Praeterea. -- Imagini non convenit cultus
internus verus Latriae, nec externus proprius, qualis est Sacrificium. Ibid..
Quarta. -- Qui colebant imaginem Christi divinis honoribus, inter Haereticos
numerantur ab Epiphanio, Augustino, and Damasceno. Atque isti cum Christum
colerent, sine dubio imaginem ejus propter ipsum colebant: non igitur imagines
licet divinis honoribus colere, i. e. cultu latriae, etiamsi quis dicat, id
esse facere propter Deum, vel Christum, non propter Imagines. Ibid.. Sexta
ratio. Haec Bellarminus.
When [Latria] or divine worship is given to an Image, because of the Relation
it has to Christ, this is Idolatry, although it be given for Christ, or God,
whether it be internal or else external, as Sacrifice. So he. This we say,
first to put you in mind of Sunt been multi, qui imagines colunt, non ut signa
-- sed magis eis fidunt quam Christo. Polydor. Virgil. Invent. lib. 6. cap. 13.
Very many of your Romish People, who adore Images Idolatrously; which although
you would cloak, yet the Complaints and outcries of your own Romish

ut ad summam Paganoru^ adorationem nil a nostris reliqui fit factum. Cassander

Authors will not suffer it to be concealed, One of them saying, that this your
worship is more manifest than can be denied; even immediately and terminately
given by your people to the thing it-selfe, which they see and adore, and which
all Christian learning teaches to be Heathenish, in an high Degree. And also
note infinite numbers of your Worshippers, who adore Idolatrously, in the same
manner of Relation, that which is here condemned by your Cardinal.

But to the point, your own Jesuits Fuerunt ex Ethnicis, qui simulachra
adorabant, quia ea animata esse credebant divinis spiritibus. Greg. Valent.

lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 13.. Quartum.
report that some Heathen Idolaters did worship Idols, believing that They were
inspired with a Divine Spirit; next that they had four kind of persuasions
for this their Belief, to wit, the Instructions of their Paganish Priests, the
Example of the whole world in their times, the power of Devils, speaking in the
Images; and lastly, the humane shape, which was presented unto them:
nevertheless so, that they sometimes honored not the things themselves, but
the Spirit which they thought them possessed withal. Will you permit us to
compare this with that which you have called but your See above.
Material Idolatry? To this end, we are to try whether there has been any
Pretense for justifying your Romish, which might not as truly excuse and
warrant that Heathenish Worship; which notwithstanding no Christian will deny
to have been most Formally, and properly Idolatrous.

Your Moral, and Conjecturall Certainty would be compared in the first place.
This the Heathens might pretend by the Reasons, by you already confessed, to
wit, the Prescriptions of their Priests, their Idols speaking, and the Example
of almost the whole vast world adoring them. Secondly, you please your selves
with your Good Intent, that, in worshipping the Bread, you think to adore
Christ; and the Pagans (which also the whole world of Idolaters professed of
themselves, and you your selves have confessed of them) in their most Formal
Idolatry, were persuaded they worshipped a True God. Thirdly, you rely upon an
Habitual Condition, namely, that although the thing which you adore, be Bread,
yet your inward Resolution is not to give Divine Honor unto it, if you knew it
were but Bread, and not Christ. But inquire you now into your own Bibles, and
you shall find that the Heathen were not inferior unto you in this
Modification also; for in the History of Bell and the Dragon it is read, that
the King of Babel, and other Babylonians worshipped Bell with Divine Honor,
thinking it to live, until such time as Daniel had discovered it to be but an
Idol: and no sooner had the King perceived the Delusion, but presently
commanded it should be demolished. The Case then is plain. He, and they, who
abhorred, and utterly destroyed that Idol, as soon as they knew it not to be
God, were therefore, before that, habitually in their hearts resolved not to
honor it, if they could have been persuaded it had not been a God. In such
just Equipage do these your Romish, and those Heathenish walk together, that
from these your own Premises, you may take your Conclusion out of the mouth
of your own Archbishop, whom you have heard affirm, that If in the worship
of this Sacrament (says he) we may be deceived, in mistaking Bread, instead of
Christ* then in this worship as madly Idolatrous as was that (*) See above,
Chap. 7. Sect. 2. at (a).
of the Heathen. So he. Which shows your Cause and theirs, in these Respects,
to be all one. We proceed a step further.

That the Romish Worship of that, which may possibly be Bread, may seem to be
in one respect worse than almost the worst of the Pagans.

SECT. II.
ALthough the very title of this Section may seem unto you fully odious, yet
let Truth (in what apparel soever it shall appear) be gracious unto you.
Costerus is a Jesuit much privileged by your Church, who doubted not to
a^^irme, that Talis error est, quo in orb terrarum nunqu^m vel visus, vel
auditus fuit -- tolerabilior enim est error eorum, qui pro Deo colunt statuam
^uream, aut alterius materiae imaginem, quomodo Gentiles snos Deos
venerabantur, vel pannum rubrum in hastam elevatum, quod narratur de Lappis,
vel viva animalia, ut quondam Aegyptii; quam eorum qui frustum panis. Coster.
Jes. Enchirid. de Sacram. Eucharist. cap. 8.. Decimo.
If Christ be not in this Sacrament, but Bread only, the Error (says he) is
more intolerable than was the Error of the Heathen, in worshipping either a
golden Statue, or a Red Clout. So he. What reason he had to speak so broad
Language, we refer to your Inquisitors, to question him for it. But what
Cause we have for the confirming our Title of this Section, we shall not
forbear to impart unto you. It is the profession of your Church to Adore Bread
in the Eucharist with Divine Worship, notwithstanding whatsoever Uncertainty of
the presence of Christ therein, by reason of (as your Jesuit Suarez See above,
Chap. 6. Sect. 6.
speaks) almost infinite Defects, which may possibly happen to cause the same.
Contrariwise the Heathen Idolaters, touching the things which they worshipped,
See in the former Section at (d).
Credebant (said your Jesuit) They believed them certainly to have been Gods.
For although some Heathen would sometime make some doubt of a [(...)] or,
(...)] what, or who the God was, whom they did adore, as they that said, Sive
tu Deus es, sive tu Dea es; Whether thou ^e God or Goddess; And the Athenians
had an Act. 17. 23.
Altar (...), To an unknown God, yet hardly shall you ever find any Example
of the Heathen, doubting [(...)] Whether it were a God, which they worshipped
as God; those of Calecute, and such like Devilish Nations excepted, who are
said knowingly to have Adored Devils, but (as some people sometime do homage
to Tyrannous Usurpers, knowing them not to be their lawful Sovereigns) only
N^^^ceant, for fear of hurt.

So abominable is your Mass worship, being both contrary to express
Scripture, which exacteth of every man Heb. 11. 6.
That comes to God that he must believe, what? [(...)] If he be? no, but
[(...)] That he is God; and also against the light of grace in all Christians,
before the darkness of Popery began; yea and against the light of nature in
the very Pagans. For although you do but seem to symbolize with them in that
one part of Idolatry, thus described by the Prophet, Esaias 44. 15, etc.
He takes wood, burns it, makes Bread, and of a part thereof makes a God,
and falling down before it, prays, Deliver me, for thou art my God: (Like as
is the taking a lump of Dough, baking it, and with part of it to feed our
Bodies, of another part to make a God, worship it, and invocate upon it,
according to your own vulgar Rimes: Non est Panis, sed est Deus, Homo
liberator meus: fit cibus expane, caro Deus exelemento: Qui me creavit sine me,
creatur mediante me) yet notwithstanding do you far exceed them, by adoring
only in an Habitual Condition, If the thing be God, which you worship;
Therefore shall they be your Judges.

CHAP. IX.
Our Examination of the Reverence professed by Protestants, and the Security of
their Profession therein; First, defining and distinguishing the Properties of
Reverence.

SECT. I.
REverence is a due Respect had unto things or persons, according to the good
qualities that is in them. This is either inward, or outward. The inward is
that our Estimation of them, according to their Conditions and Properties: the
outward is our open Expression of our said estimation, whether by words or
Acts. First of the inward estimation, whether Natural, Politic, Religious,
or Divine. Children (for Example sake) are taught by Scripture to honor their
Parents, Wives their Husbands, Husbands their Wives, Subjects their
Sovereigns, People their Pastors; And all, above all, to honor God. Our
outward Manifestation of these, be it either in word, or deed, or Gesture, is
to be discerned and distinguished by the Inward, as the honor to Parents to be
called Natural; of Subjects to Governors, Politic; of People to their
Pastors, Religious; of All to God, Divine, which is transcendently Religious,
and Spiritual. And the Outward is common to each Degree; three only outward
Acts excepted, Sacrificing, Vowing unto, and Swearing by: Homages appropriated
to the Majesty of God; Sacrifice to betoken his Sovereignty; Vowing to
testify his Providence; and Swearing for the acknowledging of his Wisdom in
discerning, Justice in condemning, and Omnipotency in revenging all Perjury,
be it never so secret.

That the Reverence used by Protestants, in receiving this Sacrament, is
Christianly Religious.

SECT. II.
THeir Inward is their religious Estimation of this Sacrament, in accounting
the Consecrated Elements to be in themselves Symboles and Signs of the
precious Body and Blood of Christ, a Memorial of his death, which is the price
of Man's Redemption, and to the faithful a Token of their spiritual Union,
with all the Members of Christ; and by the incorporation of them, in their
flesh, a Pledge of their Resurrection unto life.

Secondly their outward Application, for testifying their inward estimation,
consists not essentially in any one peculiar Gesture in it self, as you will
Conc. Carthag. 6. Can. 20. Quoniam sunt quidam, qui dic Dominico flectunt genua
in diebus Pentecostes: placuit sanctae and magnae Synodo cunctos -- stantes
Deum orare debere. Durant. de Ri^^^us, lib. 3. cap. 2. number. 21. Hoc ipsum
diebus quinquaginta a Pascha usque ad Pentecosten observari consuetu^ veteres
Patres testantur. Ratio ex Ambrosio Sermon. 21. de Pentecoste, quia
Resurrectionem Domini celebremus: and ut Hieron. Proem. in Epist. ad Ephesians. Non
flectimus genua, non curvamur in terra, sed cum Domino surgentes ad alta
sustollimus.
confess from Antiquity, whether it be in Standing, Bowing, Kneeling, or the
like; even because the Gestures of Uncovering, Bowing, and Kneeling, are
outward behaviors communicable to other persons beside God, according to their
natural, moral, politic, and religious respects. Howbeit, any of these
outward Gestures, which carry in them a greater respect of Reverence, may be
enjoined by the Church (whereunto obedience is due) according to the just
occasions inducing thereunto. And where there is no such necessary occasion,
there the public observation of the Rites of Communicating, commanded by
Christ in his first Institution, performed (namely) by supplications, and
praises, is a plain profession of Reverence; and more especially that
Invitation, used in all Churches Christian, of the Priest to the People, Lift
up your hearts; and their answerable Conclamation, We lift them up unto the
Lord.

It will be objected by Some, who pretend to have some Patronage from Calvin,
that Kneeling at the receiving of the Communion is Unlawful. Every such One is
to be entreated to be better acquainted with Calvin, where, speaking of the
Reverence of kneeling, he says, Calvin. Institut. lib. 4.. 37. Jam vero
longius prolapsi sunt (viz. Papistae) ritus enim excogitarunt pro^sus
extraneos, in hoc, ut signum divinis honoribus afficiant. At Christo (inquiunt)
hanc Venerationem deferimus. Primum si in coena hoc fieret, dicerem eam esse
adorationem legitima^ quae non in signo refidet, sed ad Christum in coelo
sedentem dirigitur.
It is lawful, if it be directed not to the sign, but to Christ himself in
Heaven; which is the resolute profession of our English Church, in the use of
this Gesture. But to return unto you, who think it no Reverence, which is not
given by Divine Adoration of this Sacrament, we ask, Do not you use the
Sacrament of Baptism Reverently? you do, yet do you not adore the water with
that [(...)] which you yield unto the Eucharist. All this notwithstanding,
Calvin his estimation of this Sacrament seems but profane to many of you: but
the reason is, you would rather condemn him, than judge him, lest that his
Doctrine, if it come to examination, might condemn you. For albeit he abhor
your Divine Adoration of the Host, yet does he also Calv. defens. Sanct. Doctr.
advers. Westphal. Sive utilitas nostra spectetur, sive dignitas and reverentia,
quam Sacramento deferri par est. page 25. Rursus; Profani, quia sacrae

corporis and sanguinis Christi rei censeantur. Ibid. p. 39.
condemn every Profane man, who shall partake thereof in the state of
Impenitency, To be guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ. Your next Question
will be, after this our Discovery of the manifold Perplexities, wherein you,
by your Romish Doctrine, are so miserably plunged, how Protestants can avoid,
in many of them, the like Intanglements.

That Protestants, in their Profession and Practice, stand secure from the
first two Romish Perplexities, in respect of Preparation of the Elements, and
undue Pronunciation of the words of Consecration.

SECT. III.
Our Church commands that the best Bread and Wine be provided for this best
of Banquets, the Supper of our lord; yet does it believe, that Christ the
Ordainer thereof will not deprive the souls of his guests of their desired
spiritual Blessings, for the negligence of his steward, in being defective to
provide the Material Elements, if so be that there be therein (according to
Christ his Institution) the substance of Bread and Wine. As for Pronuntiation,
you know, Protestants make their Celebration in a tongue known unto all the
people communicating, and in a loud voice, according to the universal Practice
of the Church of Christ in primitive times, as See above, Book 1. Chap. 2.
Sect. 6, 7.
has been confessed. So that the Peoples ears may be their own witnesses,
whether the words of Consecration, either by Prayer, or together with the form
of Repetition of the words of Institution, be truly delivered: which freeth
them from your Romish perplexity of not knowing whether the Priest have truly
Consecrated, by his muttering of the words in an unaudible voice.

The Protestants Security, in respect of the third Romish Perplexity, of
Adoring in a Moral Certainty.

SECT. IV.
Our Profession is to adore Christ with an infallible faith, and not with a
conjecturall Credulity, or Probability, as we are taught by the holy Scripture,
the Canonical foundation of Christian faith; defining Faith to be an Heb. 11.
1.
Evidence of things not seen; namely, a more infallible apprehension of the
mind, than any perception of sight can be; a faith required of every one,
which shall approach in supplication to God: Heb. 11. 6.
He that comes to God must believe that God is. Infallible faith then must
usher Prayer, yea and preaching also any fundamental doctrine of belief, as
it is written, Psalm. 116. 10. and 2. Cor. 4. 13.
I believed, therefore I spoke: yea, without divine Faith, it is impossible to
use any religious Invocation: Romans 10. 14.
How shall they invocate on whom they have not believed? So incredible and
faithless is your Romish Conjecturall Faith of your worshipping, and
Invocating Christ on the Earthly Altar, whereas (according to our Christian
Creed of his sitting at the right hand of God in Heaven) we, because
faithfully, do See the Consent of Fathers above, Chap. 4. Sect. 2.
Catholikely, and comfortably adore him, where he infallibly is upon his Throne
of Majesty in Heaven.

That the Protestants stand secure, in respect of the Fourth Romish Perplexity,
by defect in the Priestly Intention.

SECT. V.
FOr the necessity of the Priests due Intention in consecrating your Bellarm.

Jesuit Salmeron, to the contrary; grounded upon sound Reasons, (among
others, this) that this Perplexity, and doubt, whether the Priest has a Due
intention in consecrating, works to the tormenting of men's Consciences,
injury to Gods exceeding bounty and goodness, contrary to the Judgment of
Antiquity; and in special, against that of S. Augustine; Saepemihi ignotaest
Conscientia aliena, sed semper certus sum de divina misericordia. And lastly,
because of the Affinity, which it has with the heresy of the Donatists. So
he.

All which turns to the condemnation of your Doctrine (teaching a necessary
Priestly Intention) of Novelty, Impiety, and relish of Heresy. We add to this
that saying of the Apostle, Phisip. 1. 18.
If the word be preached, whether of envy, and vain glory, or of good will, I
rejoice, and will rejoice: which proves that the evil Intention of the
Messenger cannot impeach the Benefit of the message of Salvation, and embassage
of God. Now there is the like Reason of the word visible (which is the
Sacrament) as there is of the Audible. Take unto you a Similitude, in the
marginall Testimony of your Jesuit Salmeron, of a Notary public making a
true Instrument, according to the form of Court, in the time when he was
distracted in his wits; nevertheless the same Instrument is of use, and for
the benefit of the party who has it, not through the Intention of the Scribe,
but by the will of the Ordainer, and willingness and consent of the Receiver.

Our fifth Security from your Romish Perplexity, touching Ordination.

SECT. VI.
TO pass over matters not controverted between us, whether the Minister that
consecrateth this Sacrament ought to be consecrated by Ecclesiastical
Ordination to this Function (a matter agreed upon on both sides) the only
question is, if he that ministers happen to be an Intruder, and no
consecrated Minister, whether this his Defect do so nullify his Consecration
of the Eucharist, that it becomes altogether unprofitable to the devout
Communicant. Your Church in this case sends you to inquire after the
Godfathers, Godmothers, Priest, or Midwife that baptizeth, to know whether he
have been rightly baptized; and this not satisfying, she will have you seek
forth the Bishop, by whom he was ordained, and so to the Ordainer of that
Bishop, and so to spur further, and further, until you come to S. Peter, to
see whether each of these were rightly consecrated a Priest, and then to search
into so many Church-bookes, to know the Baptism of each one, without which the
Act of this Priest now consecrating is frustrate, and your Adoration
Idolatrous. Contrari-wise we, in such an indeprehensible Case, wherein the
Actor or Act has no apparent Defect, are no way scrupulous, knowing that
things do work Ad modum Recipientis: as you have heard in the Example of
preaching the word of God, were it by Judas; or if you will a transformed
Devil, yet the seed being Gods, it may be fruitful, (whatsoever the Seed-man
be) if the ground that receives it be capable. Therefore here might we take
occasion to compare the Ordination Romish and English; and to show ours, so
far as it consents with yours, to be the same; and wherein it differs to
be far more justifiable than yours can be: if it were lawful, upon so long
traveling, to transgress by wandering into bypath.

Our Security from the Romish Perplexity of Habitual Condition.

SECT. VII.
Habitual or virtuall Condition (as it is conceived by your Professors)
stands thus; I adore this which is in the hands of the Priest, as Christ, if
it be Christ; being otherwise not willing so to do, if it be not Christ. What
my Masters, Iffs, and Ands in divine worship? These can be no better in your
Church, than leakes in a ship, threatening a certain perishing, if they be not
stopped; which hitherto none of your best Artificers were ever able to do. For
as touching your profane Lecturer Suarez Ies. Simpliciter adorand us est
Christus in Eucharistia, and aliud exigere ex iis esset superstitiosum, and
vanis scrupulis, and superstitionibus expositum: neque enim est consentaneum
ibi trepida^e, ubi non est vel probabilis ratio timendi, sed potius periculum
ne dubitatione devotio animi minuatur. Tom. 3. qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 65. Sect.
2.
Suarez, laboring to persuade you to Adore Christ in the Eucharist simply
without all scrupulizing, saying, It is not fit to fear where no fear is;
when as he himself (as you have heard) has told us that there are possibly
incident See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. at (a).
Almost Infinite Defects, and consequently as many Causes of Doubting, which
may disannull the whole Act of Consecration: there needs no other
Confutation, than this, of his own shameless Contradiction, which (as you may
see) is palpably gross. So impossible it is for any of you to allay the
detestable stench of plain Idolatry. Certainly, if S. Augustine had heard that
a Worship of Latria (which he everywhere teaches to be proper to God) were
performed to Bread and Wine, as the matter of Divine Adoration, he neither
would, nor could have said, in defense thereof, as he did of the Celebation of
the Eucharist in his own time, viz. Aug. Cont. Faust. Ma^b. lib. 20. cap. 21.
Nos a Cerere and Libero Paganorum Diis long absumus.
We are far from your Paganish worshipping of Ceres and Bacchus.

But as for us Protestants, we profess no Divine Worship of God, but with a
Divine, that is, an Infallible Faith, that it is God, whom we worship; who will
not be worshipped, but in spirit and truth. What furthermore we have to say
against your Romish Mass, will be discovered in the Book following.

THE EIGHTH BOOK,
Of the Additionalls: by a Summary Discovery of the many-fold Abominations of
the Romish Mass; and of the Iniquities of the Defenders thereof.

THese may be distinguished into Principals, which are Three, the Romish
Superstitiousnesse, Sacrilegiousnesse, and Idolatrousnesse of your Mass: and
Accessaries, which are These; Obstinacies, manifold Overtures of Perjuries,
Mixture of many ancient Heresies in the Defenders thereof.

CHAP. I.
Of the peremptory Superstitiousnesse of the Romish Mass, in a Synopsis.

SECT. I.
MAny words shall not need for this first point. Superstition is described by
the Apostle, in this one word, Coloss. (...).
(...), that is, Man's will worship; as it is opposite to the worship revealed
by the will of God. What the will of Christ is, concerning the Celebration of
the Sacrament of his Body, and Blood, we have learned by his last will and
Testament, expressly charging his Church, and saying, [DOE THIS:] pointing out
thereby such proper Acts, which concerned either the Administering or the
Participating of the same holy Sacrament. But now comes in Mans's
will worship, ordained in the Church of Rome; as flatly contradictory to the
same Command of Christ, by Ten notorious Transgressions, as if it had been in
direct Terms countermanded thus, [Doe not This] (as has been Book 1.
thorowout.
proved:) notwithstanding the former direct Injunction of Christ, or
conformable Observation of the holy Apostles, or Consent, and Custom of the
Church Catholic; and that without respect had to the due Honor of God, in
his worship; or Comfort, and Edification of his People.

And then is Superstition most bewitching, when it is disguised under the
feigned vizard of false Pretenses (which have been many) devised by the new
Church of Rome, in an opinion of her own wisdom, to the befooling and
vilifying of the Ancient Catholic Church of Christ: which never esteemed the
same Reasons reasonable enough, for making any Alteration; but (notwithstanding
such imaginations) precisely observed the Precept, and Ordinance of Christ.

But that, which exceeds all height of Superstition, is, when upon the
will worship of man are stamped counterfeit Seals of forged Miracles, as if
they had been authorized by the immediate hand of God; whereof your
Legendaries have obtruded upon their Readers Book 4. Chap. 2. and 3.
Thirteen Examples, to wit, of Fictitious Apparitions of visible Flesh, and
Blood of Christ, in the Eucharist: which makes your Superstition Blasphemous,
as if God should be brought in for the justifying of Falsehood; a Sin abhorred
by holy Job, saying to his Adversaries, Job 13. 4, and 7.
You are Forgers of Lies: will you speak deceitfully for God? And furthermore
how Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous your Romish Superstition is, you may behold in
the Sections following.

Of the Sacrilegiousnesse of the Romish Mass, and Defense thereof, in the
point of Sacrifice; comprised in this Synopsis.

SECT. II.
SAcrilege is whatsoever Violation of any sacred Person, Place, or Thing. Now
omitting to speak of your Dismembring the Eucharist, by administering it but in
One kind (which your Pope Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 7. in the Challenge.
Gelasius condemned for Grand Sacrilege) or of the like points formerly
discovered, we shall insist only in your Churches Doctrine of Sacrifice,
wherein your Sacrifice is found to be grossly Sacrilegious in the Tractate of
the Sixth Book.

I. By Creating a new Sacrifice, as Proper, and thereby assuming to her self
that Book 6. Chap. 1. Sect. 5.
Excellency of Prerogative, which is proper to Christ alone the high Priest,
and Bishop of our Souls (namely) the power of ordaining Sacraments; or (if
need were) Sacrifices in his Church. Which Guiltiness we may call a
Counterfeiting of the Seal of Christ.

II. By making this Sacrifice, in her pretense, Christian; but but indeed Book
6. Chap. 5. Sect. 1.
Earthly, and Jewish.

III. By dignifying it with a Divine property of Ibid. Chap. 10.
Meritorious, and Satisfactorie Propitiation.

IV. By professing another properly Satisfactorie and Ibid. and after, etc.
Propitiatory Sacrifice, for Remission of sins, besides that which Christ
offered upon the Cross. As if after one has paid the Debts of many at once,
upon condition that such of those Debtors should be discharged, whosever
submissively acknowledging those Debts to be due, should also profess the
favor of their Redeemer; It cannot but be extreme folly for any to think,
that the money once paid should be tendered, and offered again, as often as One
or Other of the Debtors should make such an acknowledgement, the Surety having
once sufficiently satisfied for all. So Christ having once for all satisfied
the justice of God, by the price of his blood, in the behalf of all penitent
Sinners, who in Contrition of heart and a living Faith apprehend the Truth of
that his Redemption; it cannot but be both injurious to the justice of God, and
to the merit of Christ, that the same satisfactory Sacrifice, as it were a new
payment, ought again, by way of Satisfaction, be personally performed and
tendered unto God.

V. By detracting from the absolute Function of Christ his Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect.
(...).
Priesthood now eminent, and permanent before God in Heaven; and thereupon
stupifying the minds of Communicants, and (as it were) pinioning their
thoughts, by teaching them so to gaze, and meditate on the matter in the hands
of the Priest, that they cannot (as becomes Spiritual Eagles) soar alost,
and contemplate upon the Body of Christ, where it is infallible Residence is, in
that his heavenly Kingdom.

VI. By transforming (as much as they can) the Sacrament, ordained for
Christians to eat with their own mouths, into a Ibid.
Theatricall Sacrifice, wherein to be fed with the mouth of the Priest.

VII. By abasing the true value of Christ his Blood, infinitely exceeding all
valuation, in making it but Ibid. Chap. 10. Sect. 4.
finite; whereas Christ being (...), God and Man in one person, every
propitiatory work of his must needs be (...), and therefore of an infinite
price, and power.

VIII. By denying the Effect of his Ibid. Chap. 11.
Propi^iation for Sin to be plenary, in the Application thereof.

IX. There has been noted (by the way) the Portion appropriated to the
Priest, out of your Sacrifice, and to be applied to some particular Soul for
money: being an Invention, as has been confessed, void of all Ibid. Chap.
(...). Sect. 4.
Warrant, either by Scripture, or by Ancient Tradition. To say nothing of your
fine Art of cheating men's Souls by Priestly Fraud; whereof, as also of the
Rest, we have discoursed at Book 6. (...)* ^ut.
large.

A New Instance, for proof of Romish Sacrilegiousnesse, in the Prayer set
down in the Liturgy of their Mass.

SECT. III.
IN your Missall, after Consecration, it is prayed thus: Missal. Romans Offerimus
Majestati tuae, Domine, Immaculatam Hostiam sanctum panem vi^ae aeternae, and
Calicem salutis perperuae -- supra quae propitro vultu respicere digneris,
sicut dignatus es munera justi pueri tui Abel. And in the next place. Jube hae^
perferri per manus sancti Angeli in sublime Altar tuum coeleste.
We offer unto thy Majesty, O Lord, this immaculate Host, this holy Bread of
eternal life, this Cup of everlasting salvation, upon which vouchsafe to look
with a propitious and favorable Countenance, as thou did accept the gifts of
thy holy servant Abel, and command these to be carried up into thy celestial
Altar, etc. So the Canon of your Mass. Some Protestants, in their zeal to the
glory of Christ, impute unto you hereupon a Sacrilegious Profaneness, whilst
you believing That Host, and That Cup to be the very Body, and Blood of Christ,
and a Propitiatory Sacrifice in it self, yet do so pray God to be propitious
unto it, and to accept it, as he did the Sacrifice of Abel; yielding thereby
no more estimation to Christ, than to a vile sheep, which was offered by Abel.

At the hearing of this, your Cardinal (See the Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa,
cap. 24. Facilis est respensio: Non petimus pro Christi reconciliatione apud
Patrem, sed pro nostra infirmitate: etsi enim oblatio consecrata ex part rei,
quae offertur, and ex part Christi principalis offerentis semper Deo placebat,
tamen ex part Ministri and populiastantis, qui simul etiam offerunt, fieri
potest ut non placeat -- Paulo (...). Comparatio non est inter Sacrificium
nostrum, and Sacrificiu^ Abelis, sed tantum ratione fidei, and devotionis
offerentium, ut nimirum tanta fide offerant, quanta Abel -- quod Sacrificium
Abelis non habetet in se, quod Deo placere, cumque placare possit, quare
dicitur Heb. 11. per fidem obtulit Abel Deo Sacri^ficium melius -- Ratio. Genesis
4. Respe(...) Deus a^^ Abel, and Sacrificium. Post. (...). Porro. -- Deferri

Margent) 1. Prefaceth, 2. Answers, 3. Illustrateth, 4. Reasons. First of
his Preface. The Answer (says he) is easy. As if that Objection, which
seems to us a huge logg in your way, were so little an obstacle, that any
might skip over it. But have you never seen men, in trusting too much to their
nimblenesse, to overreach themselves in their leap, stumble, fall, and break
their limbs?

Sembably he in his Answer (which is the second point,) The meaning of our
Church (says he) is not to pray for Christ's reconciliation, who was always
well pleasing to God, but in respect of the infirmity of the Priest, and
people, that the offering may be accepted from them. So he. But whatsoever the
meaning of the Priest in his praying is, sure we are this cannot be the meaning
of the Prayer; for the matter prayed for is set down to be Holy Bread of life,
and Cup of Salvation, which you interpret to be substantially the Body and
Blood of Christ in the Sacrament; and the tenor of prayer expressly is, [Vpon
which Lord look propitiously] we say, upon which, not upon whom; which point
is confirmed in that which follows.

Thirdly therefore he illustrateth. The Comparison (says he) is not absolutely
between the Sacrifice of Abel, and of Christ, but in respect of the faith and
devotion of the Priest, and people, that they with like faith may offer, as
Abel did. But this piece of Answer is that, which is called in Music
Discantus contra punctum, for the prayer is directly: Look down propitiously
upon these, as thou did upon the gifts of Abel. The Comparison then is
distinctly between the Gifts, and not between the Givers. Yea but not
absolutely so meant (says he:) be it so, yet if it be so meant but in part,
that Christ, who is Propitiation it self, shall be prayed for to be
propitiously, and favorably looked upon by God, the prayer is Sacrilegious in
an high degree.

Fourthly his Reason. It is known (says he) that the Sacrifices of sheep and
Oxen had nothing in themselves, whereby to pacify, or please God, the
Scripture saying, that Abel offered a better Sacrifice than Cain. And again,
God had respect to Abel, and to his Gifts. So he. Which is the very Reason that
persuades Protestants to call that your Prayer most Sacrilegious, because
whereas the Gifts of Abel were but Sheep, etc. you, notwithstanding, compare
them with the offering up of Christ, saying, As thou did the Gifts of Abel.
For although it be true, that the Gift of Abel was accepted for the faith of
the Giver, and not the Giver for his Gift; yet if you shall apply this to the
point in Question, then your Gift (in your Opinion) being Christ, and your
Givers but simply men, (whom you have called Priest, and People) it must follow
that Christ is accepted for the faith of the Priest, and People; and not the
Priest and People for Christ, which makes your Prayer far more abominably
Sacrilegious. And not much less is that which follows, praying God to
command his Angel to carry (if the Gift be He) Christ into heaven; contrary to
the Article of our Catholic Faith, which teaches us to believe his
perpetual Residence in heaven, at the right hand of the Father. He answers:
Bellarm. sup.
It is not meant, that God would command his Angel to carry Christ's Body, but
our prayers and desires, by their intercession unto God for us. So he. Which is
as truly a false Gloss, as the former; for, in the Tenor of your Mass, the
Subject of your prayer is [Holy Bread of life, and Cup of salvation.] The
prayer is plainly thus* Upon which, O Lord, look propitiously: and immediately
after, Command [These] to be carried by thy Angel. Mark, [These] viz. That
Bread of life, and Cup of salvation, even that, which you call, The Body, and
Blood of Christ, as corporally Present: which makes your prayer to be
Sacrilegious still, and your Expositors (that we may so say) miserably
Ridiculous.

That the former Romish Prayer, as it was Ancient, does in the (then) true
meaning thereof condemn the now Romish Church of the former Sacrilegious
Innovation.

SECT. IV.
FOR to think that it should be prayed, that God would be propitious to
Christ, were an Execrable opinion, even in the Judgment of our Adversaries
themselves; who for avoidance thereof have obtruded an Exposition, as far
differing from the Text, as does This from That, or Christ from the Priest, as
you have heard. But whither will he now? Your Cardinal tells you, that the
words of your Romish Canon are ancient, such as are found in the Bellarm. lib.
2. de Missa, cap. 24. Super quae propitio, etc. habentur apud Ambrosium post
consecrationem. Lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 6. R^s^s Bellar. ibid. Haec verba
posita sunt post consecrationem apud Ambrosium lib. 4. de Sacram. cap, 6. in
Liturg^s Jacobi, Clementis, Basilii, Chrysostomi.
Missalls of S. James, of Clement Pope of Rome, of Basil, of Chrysostom, and
of Ambrose. You will hold it requisite that we consult with these Liturgies,
set out by your selves, for the better understanding of the Tenor of your
Romish Mass. The Principal Quaere will be, whether Antiquity in her
Liturgies, by praying to God for a propitious Acceptance, and admittance into
his celestial Altar, meant (as your Cardinal answered) Propitiousnesse
toward Priest, and People, in respect of their faith, and devotion; and not
toward the Things offered distinctly in themselves.

In the pretended Liturgy of S. Liturgia Iacobi ante Consecratienem. Diaconus.
Oremus pro sanctificatis tremendis donis -- ut Dominus acceptis ^is in
super-coeles^e spirituale Altate suum in odorem suavitatis mittat nobis divinam
gratiam. Tum Sacerdos. Deus, ac Pater Domini Dei, and Servatoris -- qui tibi
oblata munera frugum oblationes accepisti in odorem suavitatis -- sanctifica
animas nostras. Post Sacerdos consecra^s verba Consecrationis adhibet: Sancte
qui in sanctis requi^scis -- suscipe hymnum incorruptum in sanctis and
incruentis Sacrificiis tuis.
James (before Consecration) the prayer to God is, To accept the Gifts into his
celestial Altar; even the Gifts, which he called The fruits of the earth. And
then after, for the Parties, as well Priest, as People, To sanctify their
souls.

In the Liturgy of Liturgia Basilii ante Consecrationem. Pontifex -- Suscipe
nos, ut simus digni offerre rationabile illud absque sanguine Sacrificium --
and vide super servitutem nostram^ ^t suscepisti munera Abel, sic ex manibus
nostris suscipe ista ex benignitate tua. Et rursus Diac. Prooblatis,
sanctificatis, and honorificentissimis muneribus Deum postulemus, ut qui
accepit ea in sancto and supercoelesti Altari suo in odorem suavitatis, emittat
gratiam and spiritum nobis, etc. P^st, sequitur Cons^ratis. Po^tifex: Respice
Domine Jesus. Et post Consecrationem; Gratias agimus.
Basil (before Consecration) it is prayed to God, that the Receiving the Gifts
into his celestial Altar, would also (concerning the Parties) send his Gra^e,
and Spirit upon them.

And no less plainly Pope Clement. Constitut. lib. (...). cap. 16. called,
Constitutio Jacobi, apud Binium. Tu, qui Abelis Sacrificium suscepisti -- And
after, Pro omnibus tibi gloria, etc. cap. 17. Benign aspicere dig^eris super
haec dona propo^ita in conspectu tuo -- and complaceas tibi in eis, in honorem
Christi, and mittas spiritum super hoc Sacrificium, testem passionum ejus -- ut
ostendas hun^ panem corpus ejus, etc. Po^ Consecrationem, cap. 19. Etiam
rogemus Deum, per Christum suum, pro munere oblato Domino, ut Deus, qui bonus
est, suscipiat illud pe^ Medistorem Christ^ in coele^^e Altar suum in odorem
suavitatis pro hac Ecclesia, etc.
Clemens teaching (before Consecration) to pray God, who received the Gifts of
Abel graciously, to behold these Gifts propounded to the honor of his Son
Christ; expressly differenceth this Sacrifice done, in honor of Christ, from
Christ himself, who is honored thereby. And after Consecration to Beseech God
through Christ to accept the Gift offered to him, and to take it into his
Celestial Altar; where the prayer to God is not to accept of Christ, but of
the Gift for Christ's sake, and to the honor of Christ, in whom God is
Propitious unto us: we say again, the Gift for Christ, and not Christ for the
Gift, (what can be more plain against all Corporal Presence of Christ in the
Sacrament?) and to receive it into his Celestial Altar, but how? by
intercession of Angels? No, but expressly thus: By Christ the Mediator.

In the Liturgy of Missa Chrysostomi ante Consecrationem. Adhuc o^ferimus tibi
rationabile, and incruentum hoc obsequium, Deposcimus ut mittas Spiritum
sanctum super nos, and super apposita muneta. Sequitur Consecratio. Fac Panem
istum preciosum Corp^s, etc. Post Consecrationem. Adhuc offerimus tibi
rationabile hoc obsequium pro fideliter dormientibus, etc. Post. Dominum
deprecemur, ut qui s^scepit ea in sancto and coelesti Altari suo, mittat nobis
propterea gratiam, and donum Spiritus Sancti.
Chrysostom (before Consecration) God is prayed unto, and supplicated thus: We
beseech thee to send thy Spirit upon us, and upon the Gifts set before us.

Even as A^s. de Sacram. lib. 4. cap. 6. post Consecrationem. Offerimus tibi
hunc Panem ^anctum, (...) Calicem, and petimus ut hanc Oblationem suscipias in
sublimi Altari tuo per manus Angelorum, sicu^ ac^ipere dignatus es munera pucri
tui Abel, etc.
Ambrose explaineth his Supplication (after Consecration) for God, To accept
this Oblation, namely that, which he called Holy Bread, and Cup.

If therefore these former Forms may interpret your Roman Liturgy, as it was
Ancient, the prayer therein to God, desiring him to be Propitious, must have
relation to the things above specified called Holy Bread of life, and Cup of
Salvation, as distinguished from Priest, and People. Wherefore your Roman
Missalls being so Ancient in this one point, in praying God (after
Consecration) to be Propitious to that, which is called the Bread of life
eternal, and Cup of everlasting salvation; lest it might carry a Sacrilegious
Sense, to wit, that the Body of Christ is here the proper Subject of the
Eucharist, and consequently to need a Propitiation to God, by virtue of men's
prayers (thereby greatly derogating from the meritorious Satisfaction of
Christ:) you ought to reduce this your Roman Canon to the Orthodox meaning of
Ancient Liturgies above mentioned; and to understand it Sacramentally only,
(namely) our Objective Representation, Commemoration, and Application thereof
by us, which is our Act of Celebration.

To the former vast heap of Sacrilegious Positions, and Practices, we may
add your other many vile, and impious Book 5. thorowout.
Indignities offered to the all-glorious Son of God, in making his sacred
Body, in your own opinions, obnoxious to the Imprisoning in Boxes, Tearing
with men's Teeth, Devouring, Vomiting it by the Communicants, and the
Transmittance into your guts, together with the Eating, and Feeding thereupon
by Dogs, Mice, Worms, and (which transcendeth, if it may be, all your other
Absurdities) to be deprived of all natural power of Motion, Sense, and
Understanding. O Abominable! Abominable!

A Synopsis of the Idolatrousnesse of the Romish Mass, and Defense thereof; by
many Evidences from Antiquity.

SECT. V.
OUR first Argument is against the foundation thereof, which is your
Interpretation of the Article [HOC] by denying it to have Relation to Bread;
contrary to the verdict of an Inquest of Ancient Fathers, showing that the same
points out Bread, as you have Book 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 6.
heard; whereby the monstrous Conception of Transubstantiation is strangled in
the very womb.

Insomuch that sometimes they expressly Ibid.
interpret it thus; Christ's Body, and Blood, that is, (say they) The Bread, and
Wine: Item, He gave the name of the Sign to the thing signified. Item, Bread
the Sign of his Body: And lastly, Bread is called Christ's Body, because it
signifies his Body.

Secondly (in the point of Transubstantiation it self) they calling the
Eucharist (which you dare not) Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 5. and 11. and Sect. 14.
in Chryso^. and by Cyprian his Confutation of the Aquarii, ibid. Sect. 5. and
Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 3.
Bread, and Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 5.
Wine, after Consecration, and naming them Ibid. Sect. 13.
Earthly materials, and Matter of Bread, and also (as you have heard out of
the Ancient Liturgies) Above in this Book Chap. 1. Sect. 4.
Fruits of the Earth; and yet more plainly, by way of Periphrasis, describing
them to consist of Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 6.
Diverse grains, and Diverse grapes. After, by approving the Suffrage and
judgment of our Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 8, 9, etc.
Senses, in discerning all Sensible things; and in special the Eucharist it
self; and at length affirming, that there remains therein the Book 3. Chap.
3. Sect. 11.
Substance of Bread, and Wine, which are the Subject matter of your Divine
Adoration. All which are other Three Demonstrations of their meanings; every
singular point being avouched by the Suffrages of Antiquity.

Thirdly against your Faith, concerning the manner of Corporal Presence of
Christ in the Eucharist; because so far were the Fathers from believing that
the Body of Christ could be in Book 4. thorowout.
diverse places (as you say in Millions) at one time, that by this property of
Being in many places at once, they have discerned Angels to be Finite Spirits,
and not God. They have distinguished the Godhead of Christ from his Manhood;
and they have proved the Holy Ghost to be God, and no Creature by the same
Reason. Than which Three Arguments none can be more Convincent. Whereunto you
may add the Fathers speeches, contradicting your Dream of a Body whole in
every part, in whatsoever space, or place: by judging it Impossible; and also
concluding Christ his Ascension into Heaven, to argue his Absenc^ from Earth;
all which have Ibid. Chap. 7. Sect. 6. and Book 5. Chap. 3. thorowout.
been discussed from point to point.

Our Fourth General Argument is, that whereas your Corporal Presence must
needs infer Corporal Eating thereof by the Communicants, notwithstanding you
have heard the contrary Sentences of Ancient Fathers, against Book 5.
thorowout.
Tearing, and Swallowing of Christ's Body, and Bodily Egestion: next concerning
the Eaters, that only the Godly faithful are partakers thereof; insomuch that
even the Godly under the old Testament did eat the same. Then, of the
Remainders of the Consecrated Hosts, that they were Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 10.
Eaten (by the ordinance of the Church) by Schoole-boyes, and sometimes Burnt
in the fire: besides they called them Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 11. and Book 7.
Chap. 3. Sect. 2.
Bits, and Fragments of Bread broken, (after Consecration) and diminished: and
lastly in respect of the End of Eating, Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 11.
They held the thing present to be a pledge of Christ's Body absent, and also
Book 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3.
allowed such a Touch of his Body by Faith, that whosoever so touches him is
Sanctified. Which Observations, concerning our Fourth General Argument, do
minister unto us five particular Reasons, which make our Defense to be
Impregnable.

Fifthly, forasmuch as you teach the Subject matter of the Eucharist to be the
Body of Christ, as a proper Sacrifice propitiatory; we, upon due inquisition
into the doctrine of Antiquity, have Book 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. thorowout, and
elsewhere.
found the Ancient Fathers 1. Noting that, which they called Sacrifice herein,
to be Bread, and Wine, saying thereupon that Melchizedech in that his Bread and
Wine offered the Body and Blood of Christ. 2. Such a Subject, which being taken
in great Quantity does Book 4. Chap. 10. Sect. 1.
nourish and satiate man's Bodily Nature. 3. Such as needs prayer to God, that
it may be In this Book 8. Chap. 1. Sect. 3.
Acceptable to God, as was the Sacrifice of Abels sheep. 4. Sonaming it an
Vnblo^dy Sacrifice, as meaning thereby Book 6. thorowout, more especially
Chap. 5. Sect. 9, and 10.
void of Blood, which cannot agree to the Body of Christ now risen from death.
5. So qualifying their other Exuberances, and Excess of speech (wherein they
named it The same Sacrifice of Christ once offered) by an (...), correcting it
thus; Book 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 6.
A Sacrifice, or rather a Memorial thereof. 6. By placing the Sacrifice of
Christ his Body, as now Presentative only in Heaven; and the thing offered on
Earth but a Sign. 7. In all your objected Testimonies, for proof of the same
Body of Christ in the Eucharist, which suffered on the Cross, they understood
the same as the Book 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
Object of our Remembrance, and not as the Subject of Offering, which make up
so many Arguments more. 8. By paralleling In this Book, Ch^ 2. Sect. 2, and 3.
Baptism with the Eucharist, in like tenor of speech, from point to point. 9.
By praying God to be Above in this Book Chap. 1. Sect. 3.
Propitious to that which is offered.

Sixthly, upon the same Doctrine of Corporal Presence you have erected and
fastened the roof of all your Building, which is, Divine Adoration of the
Host: yet notwithstanding have you not been able, by the testimonies of any
ancient Father, to free your selves from Formal Idolatry, by any of your Book
7. thorowout.
Pretenses (devised for your excuse) either of Good Intent, Moral Certainty,
or of Habitual Condition: especially seeing that the Fathers (by that their
universal Invitation, [Lift up your Hearts] abstracted still the thoughts of
the Communicants from contemplating of any Subject present here Below, that
they might be drawn to the meditation of the Body of Christ, as it is in
Heaven.

Lastly, in your own Romish Mass, praying (after Consecration) God to be
propitious to the thing offered, as to Abel's Sacrifice, which was but a
sacrificed Sheep.

Compute all these Particulars, and you shall find about sixteen Arguments,
to prove you to be absolutely Idolaters. We having thus revealed these Three
Principal, and Fundamental Abominations, do now proceed to their
Concomitants and Consequences, which are Mixtures of Heresy in many, Overture
of Perjury in some, and Obstinacy in all. We begin at the last.

CHAP. II.
Of the stupendous Obstinacy of the Romish Disputers, made palpable by their
own Contradictions; and of the Defense thereof, as being Contradictory in it
self.

SECT. I.
ALL your Disputers show themselves in nothing more zealous, than in
maintenance of your Romish Mass, which they contend for by objecting
Scriptures, Fathers, and Reasons: notwithstanding their Expositions of
Scriptures, their Inferences out of the Fathers, their devised Reasons, and
almost all their Confutations are confuted, rejected, and contradicted by their
own fellows, as the Sections thorowout this whole Tractate does plainly
demonstrate. We cannot therefore otherwise judge, but that as Prejudice is the
chief Director, so Obstinacy is the greatest Supporter of your Cause.

How much more when the Defense it self is found to consist upon mere
Contradictories, whereof you may take a Taste out of your Doctrine of Corporal
Presence, and of a proper Sacrifice. In the first, by obtruding on men's
Consciences a Belief (upon due Consequence) of a Body of Christ Borne, and not
Borne of the Virgin Mary; One, and not One; Finite, and not Finite; Divisible,
and not Divisible; Perfect, and not Perfect; and also Glorious, and not
Glorious, as has been Book 4. thorowout.
proved in each point.

2. In a point of properly Sacrificing of Christ's Body, your Music stands
upon the same kind of Discords, of See Book 6. thorowout.
Teaching a Body Broken, and not Broken; a matter visible, not visible; of
Blood shed, and not shed; and of a suffering Destruction, and not suffering
Destruction. Evident Arguments of Obstinacy one would think, and yet behold a
plainer, if it may be.

One Example, in stead of many, of a stupendous Obstinacy, in urging the
Judgment of Antiquity, for Defense of your Romish Mass, in the chiefest parts
thereof; proved by instancing only in their like Sayings concerning Baptism.

SECT. II.
THree chief Jesuits, besides others, have been (as you may Book 6. Chap.
5. Sect. 13.
remember) extremely urgent, and important with Protestants to show, if they
could, the like Phrases of the Fathers in Baptism, as were used of them
concerning the Eucharist, in the question of Sacrifice: as if the just
paralleling of these Two might be a Satisfaction unto themselves, concerning
that one point. We are to deal more liberally with them, and whereas they
assume unto themselves the suffrages of Antiquity, 1. For a Literal Exposition
of Christ's words [This is my Body:] 2. For a Change of Bread by
Transubstantiation into his Body: 3. For a Corporal Presence of the same Body
in the Sacrament: 4. For a Bodily Union with our Bodies: 5. For a Proper
Sacrifice of the Eucharist: And lastly for a Divine Adoration thereof, we
answer them from the Fathers, in their like sayings concerning Baptism
thorowout every particular.

A Synopsis of the Speeches of Fathers, objected in the Defense of the
Masse-points, and paralleled (and consequently satisfied) by the like
Equivalent speeches of the Fathers touching Baptism.

SECT. III.
THe two Proper Sacraments, as the two Seals of the new Testament, Baptism
and the Eucharist, use to go in equipage in the writings of Antiquity. The
Parallel does consist in these two; your Objections, in urging the Fathers
Phrases, and wresting them to your Romish Literal Sense, concerning the
Eucharist: and our Solutions, by the equivalent Terms of the same Fathers
given unto Baptism, and thereby instructing us of their Sacramental and
Figurative Interpretation.

OB. 1. The Fathers, say you, called the Eucharist an Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect.
6. (in the first Challenge.)
Antitype, because an Antitype is not every Sign, but that which differs
almost nothing from the Truth. Ergo the word Antitype does not prove a
figurative Sense. And again they call Bread Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 9.
The Body of Christ.

SOL. The Fathers accordingly call Baptism Cyrillu^ Hieros. my^ag. Catech. 2.
(...).
The Antitype of Christ's Passion. And again they observe that S. Paul calls
it a Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 9.
Burial. Ergo neither of both make for a Literal Sense.

OB. 2. You contend by the Fathers to prove a Corporal Change of Bread into
Christ's Body, because they say of it, after Consecration, Book 3. Chap. 4.
Sect. 3.
It is not now Common Bread. Book 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 3.
Nor are we to consider it as Bare Bread, yea, Ibid. Sect. 5.
no sensible thing is delivered herein: Ibid. Sect. 2.
And it is changed by Divine Omnipotency into another nature. Ergo they meant
a Corporal Presence of Christ.

SOL. Your Consequence is lame, and out of joint in every part, because the
Fathers, speaking of Baptism, have said as much, to wit, Book 3. Chap. 4.
Sect. 3.
We are not to behold this as common Water; Book 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 3.
Nor is it simple Water: Ibid. Sect. 8.
Nor to be discerned with our eyes, but with our minds: Ibid. Sect. 5.
Wherein no Sensible thing is given; seeing the Ibid. Sect. 2.
Water by benediction is made a Divine Laver; working miraculous effects:
whereby the party baptized is made a Ibid.
new Creature, and his Body made the Ibid. Sect. 7.
Flesh of Christ crucified.

OB. 3. You labor to prove a Corporal Presence out of the Fathers, where they
say; Book 4.
Christ is herein (without mention of Presence:) and where they add saying,
Book 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 6.
Think not it is the Priest, but Christ that reaches it unto ^hee.

SOL. As though such Phrases of the Fathers were still Literally meant, or that
you are ignorant of their like sayings, in behalf of Baptism: viz. Book 4.
Chap. 1. Sect. 2.
We have Christ Present at the Sacrament of Baptism; where Book 3. Chap. 4.
Sect. 6.
Not the Minister, but God holds the head of the party baptized.

OB. 4. To evince a Corporal Participation of Christ, in communicating of the
Eucharist, and consequently the Bodily Presence, are alleged the speeches of
the Fathers, of our Book 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3.
Touching Christ's Body, and Book 5. thorowout.
Eating Christ's flesh, of Ibid.
Natural union with his Body, and that the Eucharist is our Ibid. Chap. 8.
Sect 3.
Viaticum, and Pledge of our Resurrection; whereunto is added that Ibid. Chap.
2. Sect. 4.
Contemptuous Communicants do more injury to Christ, than they that denied
him: Book 5. Chap. 3. Sect. 1.
Eating and drinking their own judgment.

SOL. And what of Baptism? concerning Touching; the Fathers teach that we
Book 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3.
Take hold of the feet of Christ: concerning Eating, that the party Baptized
may be said to Hieronymus ad Edi^. Nos in baptismo, sanguine and Corpore
Christi vescimur.
Eat the Flesh of Christ, in respect of the thing it self: concerning Union
with Christ, they add Book 5. Chap. 8. Sect. 3.
We are hereby One with him, not only by assent of will, but even naturally;
and Ibid.
Incorporate in him, Ibid.
made thereby bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh: Even Ibid.
The flesh of Christ crucified. Concerning the Effect, they hold that Ibid.
Baptism is our Viaticum, and the Earnest of our Resurrection, and salvation:
whereunto is added out of the Apostle, concerning the Contemners of their vow
of Baptism, that Ibid. Chap. 2. Sect. 4.
They crucify unto themselves the Son of God. Book 5. Chap. 3. Sect. 4.
And he that receives Baptism unworthily, is guilty of judgment.

OB. 5. To beget an opinion of the proper Sacrifice of the Eucharist, and
consequently a Corpor all Presence of Christ herein, you insist upon such
Phrases of the Fathers as call it a Book 6. thorowout.
Sacrifice, still exacting of Protestants to show, if ever any Father said as
much of Baptism, to name it a Sacrifice; or the Celebration thereof Ibid.
Chap. 5. Sect. 13.
The Immolation of Christ.

SOL. And you have been plentifully satisfied, in both, out of the Testimonies
of Antiquity, often calling Baptism a Ibid.
Sacrifice, and sometimes also the Passion of Christ.

OB. 6. Your last and worst Contention is in Defense of a Divine Adoration of
the Eucharist, and consequently a Corporal Presence of Christ in the same, as
from the judgment of Ancient Fathers, by manifold Arguments, wherein you may
be pleased (for Brevity sake) to let your Ob. for the Eucharist, and our Sol.
for Baptism wrestle, and grapple together. Your first Ob. is taken from their
Reverend Silence, for they instruct Communtcants not to speak of the Eucharist
before Catechumenists, or Insidels, saying, Book 7. Chap. 3. Sect. 4.
The faithful know it; pretending that the like Circumspection cannot be
showed of Baptism. Sol. Even as upon the same Consideration they forbid speech
of Baptism, expressly saying: Ibid.
The faithful know it; and Ibid.
Inhibiting All, except the Baptized, to see it. A second Note of Reverence is
taken from the Ef^ects. Ob. Book 4. Chap. 2. Sect. 2.
Miracles were wrought by the Eucharist, and at it. Sol. Ibid. Sect. 5.
They show miracles wrought about Baptism also. A Third Ob. is grounded upon
Reverence done by Angels, because they are said to be Book 7. Chap. 2. Sect.
2.
Present, and attendant at the Celebration of the Eucharist, Sol. Namely, as
they are likewise said to be Ibid.
Present at Baptism, and to honor it, with their Presence. A fourth Ob. (^o
come to the Communicants themselves) arises from danger of Contempt, even
Book 5. Chap. 2. Sect. 7.
Such, as to eat and drink judgment to themselves. Sol. Ibid.
So they, who receive Baptism unworthily, receive their own judgment. A
Fifth Ob. is (for danger begets Dread) from fear, where with they are moved
to approach to the Eucharist, which therefore the Fathers call a Book 7. Chap.
2. Sect. 1.
Dreadful Sacrament, and causing horror. Sol. To wit, as they call the words
of Baptisime Book 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 8.
Terrible, and it is Canons Dreadful, Book 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 2.
whereunto the Baptized are brought with fear. Ob. 6. But none (say the
Fathers) Ibid. Sect. 3.
Communicates of the Eucharist, before he Adore. And, Ibid.
They first adore Christ (say they, speaking of men of years) who are to be
Baptized in his name. Ob. 7. But the Fathers tell us Book 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 3.
They reverence the Eucharist. Sol. True: even as they say, Ibid.
We reverence Baptism, wheresoever it is. Ob. 8. Lastly they use a form of
Invocation upon the Eucharist, thus: Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect. 4.
Ob Divine Sacrament, reveal unto us, etc. Sol. They do so, but in the same
figurative manner of speech, called Prosopapoeia, wherein they as well use the
same form concerning Baptism, as thus: Ibid.
Ob Water! which have washed our Savior, when he was imbr^ blood, etc.

CHALLENGE.
SO many Testimonies of Fathers, so mainly insisted upon by vour Doctors, for
warrant of such Erroneous, Superstitious, Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous Romish
Doctrines, and each one not more vehemently objected, in the Question
concerning the Eucharist, than easily retorted, and confuted, by instancing in
Baptism; what greater Evidence can any desire to be made of a wi^full
Obstinacy (that we say not madness) than this of your Disputers appears to be?
how much more, if we should point at the other manifold Instances, which we
have prosecuted at large thorowout this whole Volume, wherein their
Inconsionableness has been manifested in all passages to the Conscience of
every indifferent Reader. Yet were this their Guilt not so heinous, it such
their Obstinacy were not infected with some contagion of Perjury.

A Synopsis of manifold Overtures of Perjuries, in Defense of the Romish Mass.

SECT. IV.
EVery Perjury presupposes an Oath; which you have in the Bulla Pii Quarti
super forma Juramenti -- Profiteor omnia declarata in Concilio Tridentino, and
hanc esse fidem veram Catholicam, extra quam nemo salvus esse potest.
Bull of Pope Pius IV. imposed upon every Ecclesiasticke, subject to the Sea of
Rome, for the ratifying of the Belief of the many new Romish Articles
contained therein, as True, Catholic, and without which none can be saved.
The due proof that the same Oath, almost in each new Article, makes the
Swearer obnoxious to Perjury, is a Subject which would require a full Treatise;
for the which we are not altogether unprovided. But we are to confine our
selves to the Observations promised in our former Discourse, in four special
points.

I. Overture of Perjury is in Swearing unto that, which it called The Vulgar
Latin Translation.

THis is decreed in the Council of Synod. Trid. Sess. 4. Decretum de Editione
statuit, ut haec vulgata editio, quae tot saeculorum usu approbata in Ecclesia
in publicis. lectionibus, disputationibus, and expositionibus pro Authentica
habeatur, ut nemo illam rejicere quovis praetextu audeat -- statuit and
decrevit ut haec vetus editio quam emendatissime imprimatur.
Trent to be Authentical, and not to be rejected upon any Pretense whatsoever.
Whereunto (together with all other Decrees, and Declarations of the same
Council) you are sworn by the form of Oath set down in the foresaid Bull of
the Pope. The same Vulgar Translation, professed by you to be Authentical, and
that (as you expound it) it is Sacrobosc. Defens. Decreti Trid. part. 2. cap.
4. Quando in hac Disputatione Authenticam dicimus versionem, nihil aliud
volumus, quam eam esse omnino conformem suo fonti, sive fidelem esse, ac
synceram, etc. Possevin. Bib^th. part. 2. lib. 12. cap. 16. Sane Authenticam
prore certae fidei poni constat. Greg. Valent. Anal. lib. (...). cap. 5. Esse
Authenticam, nihil aliud est hoc in loco quam conformem esse Originali.
Consonant unto the Original, the Hebrew, and Greek Texts; has
notwithstanding been rejected by your Book 6. Chap. 1. Sect. 2.
Cardinal, and the Greek Translation urged for proof of a Proper Sacrifice.
Even as it has been frequently excepted against by other learned Doctors in
your Church, after the Council of Trent, noting Errors therein not only by
fault of Print, but also such as happened by the Negligence, or Ignorance of
the Author thereof, as is Azorius Moral. Tom. 1. lib. 8. cap. 3. Quarto. etc.
Quaeritur an Vulgata in reliquis extra fidem and mores (in quibus pro cerro
habendum, Eam omni vacare crrore,) errorem aliquem contineat. Inter Catholices
dubi^ est; quib^ asserentibus c^m esse a Concilio approbatam, tanquam immunem
abo^i errore in fide and motibus, non tamen ab aliis, and proinde aliqua in ea
esse vitia, item aliqua, quae significantius, proprius, verius, and melius
verri po^: aliqua esse in contrarium and alienum sensum conversa, idque prob^o
C^ (...), qui post Concilium Tridentinum scripserant, viz. Vega, lib. 15. cap.

Scriptorum, sed etiam incuria and neg^ ipsius Interpretis.
confessed; notwithstanding that Inhibition in that Decree, viz. Not to reject
it upon any Pretense whatsoever. Who, to free themselves from Perjury, make
this Comment upon it, that this restraint of Not rejecting it is only in matter
of Faith, and good manners. Which is also your Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei,
cap. 12. Ecclesia tantum hanc versionem appellavit, non ita tamen ut asseruerit
nullos Librarioru^ errores in ea reperiri, sed certos nos reddere voluit, in
iis presertim quae ad fidem and mores pertinent, multa esse in hac versione
Interpretum errata. Eodem modo Sacrebosc. Defens. fid. Trid. and Salmeron. Tom.

Cardinal his Evasion; but is no better than a lurking hole, and so seems it
to be to your two Jesuits Azorius qo sup. Mihi vero verior videtur eorum esse
sententia, qui opinantur vulgatam Editionem non solum in rebus fidei, and
morum, sed in coeteris quoque omnibus omni errore carere: quia licet aliquando
aliqua significantius, proprius, ac latius reddi potuerit; non tamen verius,
aut simpliciter certius.
Azorius, and Greg. Valent. Analys. lib. 8. cap. 4.. Etenim etc. Quod autem
Ecclesia addit: Ne ullus illam quovis praetextu audeat rejicere, id profecto
evidenti argumento est, in omnibus omnino locis, and quod attinet ad omnes
scripturae sententias esse hanc ut Authenticam (i. e. Conformem Scripturae
Originali) a Concilio approbatam. Secus enim praetextus aliquis superesset,
quo, non obstante hac definitione Concilii, posser aliquando ea Editio in
Disputationibus rejici, nempe si diceretur in hoc certe aut in illo loco, non
esse hujus Authorem Editionis Spiritus Sancti mentem assequntum -- In omnibu^s
igitur locis v^t Concilium Eam haberi pro Authentica, exceptis erroribus
Typographorum -- (Vt Judic. cap. 11. pro* Altera Matr^s loctum fuisse Adultera
Matre, ut quidam objiciunt) -- Nam Concilium probavit veterem been Typis
impressam -- Post.. Porro. Nullo modo audiendi sunt it, qui; post Concilium
Tridentinum, contendunt, Editionem Vulgatam aliquibus in locis, quod ad ipsam
sententiam (...); Qui^ (...) ^raeti, and H^ci Codices, siquidem diffideant a
nostra, sunt per eam cornigendi.
Valentia, who think that Oath to be violated, if the Vulgar Latin be
rejected at all, as less true than the Originalls. And your Spanish
Inquisitors finding urged, in one of your Romish Doctors, the Rule of Hierome;
and Augustine, which is, that no Translation Latin, or other be further
allowed than as it agrees with the Originalls, they fair and cleanly wipe it
out, saying that Index. Expurg^ius Hi^ a^ nomen Martinz. -- Quamvis haec, quae
Hieronymus, and Augustinus docuerunt, vera sunt, tamen post Concilii Tridentini
Decretum, non licet Vulgatae Latinae. Testimonia quovi^ (...), (...) in ipsius
Concilii Decreto constitutum est. fol. 145.
Although that, which Hierome and Augustine taught, be true; yet now since the
Council of Trent it is not lawful to reject the same Translation upon any
pretense whatsoever. So they. And so far unsatisfied are your Doctors, in
taking this Oath.

We are furthermore not destitute of matter for a large Consutation (first) of
your assuming S. Hierome as the Author of your Vulgar Latin Translation; to
manifest that it is no more the Translation of Hierome, or yet of any one
Author, than the diverse clothes of a man's body from head to foot, can be
called the work of one singular workman.

Secondly, concerning the Authority thereof, you profess it to be Authentical
(that is, as you have defined) Conformable to the Original Hebrew and Greek:
although it may be as easily proved, not to be that Ancient Vulgar, which had
continued (as the Decree speaks) from diverse ages, than the Ship of Theseus,
which after some ages had been so thoroughly battered and pierced, that at last
the keele and bottom thereof did only remain, which could be called the Same.
But passing by all further Dispute, we shall refer you to the judgment of
the Patrones of the former Rule (so insolently contemned by the Spanish
Inquisitors, as you have heard) by one Instance, which may be sufficient in it
self for trial of the Case now in hand.

The Text of Scripture is Ephesians. 1. 14. in the Latin Translation (even in
that, which is set forth by Pope Clem. Octarus -- In (...) ^ -- (...)
accuratissime mendis purgatus.
Clement, as The most accurate Edition) thus: Ephesians. 1. 14. Lat. Vulg. Spiritu
fignati promissionis, quae est pignus haereditatis. Graece, (...): in quem
locum Hieronym. Pignus Latinus interpres pro Arrhabone posuit: Arrhabo futurae
emptionis quasi quoddam testimonium, and obligamentum datur: Pignus vero pro
mutua pecunia ponitur, and cum illa reddita fuerit, reddenti debitum pignus a
Creditore. Aug. Sermon. de visime Dei, ^om. 10. page 1687. Accipis Codicem ab
amico, cui das pignus, cum reddideris quod accepisti, ille, cui reddis,
habebit, tu pignus accipies, non enim habebit ambas res: sed quando pretium
paras dare pro care, quam tenes bonae fidei contractu; de ipso pretio das
aliquid, and exit Arrha, non pignus, quod sit complendum, non quod sit
auferendum. Sed si Deus charitatem dar, tanquam pignus per spiritum suum, cum
eam rem ipsam reddiderit. qua promissa pignus dedit, auferendum est a nobis
Pignus? Absit! Sed quod dedit, hoc implebit: ideo melius Arrha, quam Pignus --
hoc enim implebitur, cum Arrha data est.
You are sealed with the spirit of promise, which is the Pledge of your
inheritance. But in the Greek it is: You are sealed with the spirit of
promise, which is the Earnest of your inheritance. The Question is, whether of
these is to be preferred; and Hierome, and Augustine are ready to resolve you
herein, both of them correcting the Vulgar Translation in the word Pledge, and
one of them giving an Absit^l against this Sense of it. The Reason of both is,
because he that gives a Pledge takes it again, when the Thing for which it
was pledged, is received. But he that gives an Earnest, will have it continue
with him, to whom it was given. And so God assuring his Chosen, by his Spirit,
does for their greater Confidence give it as an Earnest, and not as a Pledge.
So they. Thereby advancing Gods gracious love, toward man, and man's faith in
God's love. Here will be no corner of Pretense, that this being an Error of
Print, and not of Doctrine, may be rejected by you without Prejudice to your
Oath; no, for Error of Print arises from some affinity of words, (as where
these words; This is a sound reason, being delivered to the print, was returned
from the Press thus; This is a fond reason.) But between Pignus, and Arrhabo,
there is no more Symphony than between an Horse, and a Saddle. Nor will it
avail you to say that the Original Greek was corrupted, for it is the same
Greek word, which Hierome himself, (who as you know used the perfectest
Greek Text) does here avow to be True.

II. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers is in swearing to the Romish
Expositions of Scripture.

THe Tenor of the Oath, in this respect, is: Bulla eadem. Sacram Scripturam
admitto juxta eum fensum, quem Tenuit, and Tenet Matter Ecclesia -- extra quam
nemo salvus, etc.
I admit the sacred Scriptures in that Sense, which the Mother Church has
held, and does hold. By [Mother Church] understanding the Church of Rome, as
without which there is no salvation; which is expressed in the same Oath, as
another Article therein, and which elsewhere we have proved to be a GRAND
IMPOSTVRE, in a full Tractate, from the Doctrine of the Apostles, of General
Counsels, of several Catholic Churches, and from such Primitive Fathers,
whose memories are at this day registered in the Romish Calender of Saints. How
then can the Oath for this point be taken without danger of Perjury? But to
come to the Article, concerning the Expositions of Scriptures According to the
sense of the Church of Rome, which would thereby be thought to Hold no Sense of
Scripture now, which she had not Held in more Ancient Times. We, for Trial
hereof; shall for this present seek after no other Instances, than such as in
this Treatise have been discussed, and for brevity-sake single, out of many,
but only Three; A first is in that Scripture Ioh. 6. Except you eat the flesh
of the Son of man, you cannot have life.

The word [Except] was extended unto Infants in the days of Pope Innocent the
First, continuing (as has been Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 11.
confessed) six hundred years together, when the Church of Rome thereupon Held
it necessary for Infants to receive the Eucharist. Contrarily the now Roman
Church Holds it Inexpedient to administer the Eucharist unto Infants, as you
have heard.

Secondly, Luc. 22. Take, Eat, etc. Your Church of Rome, in the days of Pope
Nicolas, in a Council at Rome, Held, that by the word, Eat, was meant an
Book 5. Chap. 4. Sect. 2.
Eating, by Tearing the Body of Christ sensually with men's teeth, in a
Literal sense. Which your now Roman Church (if we may believe your Jesuits)
does not Hold, as has appeared.

Thirdly the Tenor of the Institution of Christ, concerning the Cup, was Held
in the days of Pope Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 13.
Gelasius to be peremptory, for the administration thereof, to prove that the
Eucharist ought to be administered in both kinds to all Communicants, and
judging the dismembring of them a Grand Sacrilege, as you have heard: whereas
now your Romish Church Holds it not only lawful, but also religious to
withhold the Cup from all, but only consecrating Priests. Upon these (omitting
other Scriptures, which you your selves may observe at your best leisure) we
conclude. You therefore in taking that Oath, swearing to admit all
Interpretations of Scripture, both which the Church of Rome once Held, and now
Holds; the Proverb must needs be verified upon you, viz. You hold a Wolf by
the ear: which howsoever you Hold, you are sure to be Oath-bit, either in
Holding TENVIT, by TENET, or in Holding TENET, by TENVIT.

III. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers, is in swearing to the pretended
Consent of Fathers, in their Expositions of Scriptures.

Hear your Oath. Bulla ^ad. Nec Scripturam ullam, nisi juxta unanimem
Consensum Patrum interpretabor.
Neither will I ever interpret any Scripture, but according to the unanimous
consent of Fathers. Here the word [Fathers] cannot betoken Bishops and Fathers
assembled in a Council, where the major part of voices conclude the less; for
Council never writ Commentaries upon Scriptures, but from Scriptures collect
their Conclusions. And although the word [Vnanimous] does literally signify
the universal Consent (which would infer an Impossibility, because that all
Fathers have not expounded any one Scripture, and very few All) yet that you
may know we press not too violently upon you, we shall be content to take this
word Morally, with this Diminution, For the most part; and hereupon make bold
to aver, that your Iuror by this Oath is sworn to a flat Falsity, because
you cannot deny but that the Fathers, in their Expositions, dissent among
themselves, sometimes a Greater part from the less; insomuch that you your
selves are at difference among your selves, which part to side with: Valent.
Ies. Anal. l^b. 8. cap. 8. Patet nobis via urgendi unum aut alrerum Doctorem
authoritate reliquorum.
With the greater (says Valentia,) nay but sometime with the Canus lo^. theol.
lib. 7. cap. 3. number. 8. Plurium Sanctorum authoritas, reliquis licet
paucioribus reclamantibus, firma Argumenta sufficere, and praestare non valet.
Lesser, (says Canus.) Can you dream of an Unanimity in Disparity? Sometime
there is a Non-Constat, what is the Judgment of the Fathers in some points,
which you call matter of Faith. What then? Valent. quo supra. Quod si per
Sententiam Doctorum aliqua fidei controversia non satis commode componi posset,
co quod de little consensu non satis constaret, sua tunc constet Autoritas
Po^tifici, ut consult is aliis ad definiendum reguli^, de quibus est dict^m,
Ecclesiae proponat, quid sit sentiendum.
Then (says your Jesuit) the Authority of the Pope is to take place, who
being guided by other rules may propound what is the Sense. Behold here the
very ground of that, which we call Popery, which is devising and obtruding upon
the Church of Christ new Articles of Faith unknowen (for ought you know) to
Ancient Fathers. And is it possible to find an Unanimity of Consent in an
Individual Unity, or rather a Nullity? for what else is an ignorance, what the
Sense of the Fathers is, whether so, or so?

Next, that it may appear that this Article, touching the Unanimous Consent of
Fathers, is a mere Ostentation and gullery, and no better than that Challenge
made by the wise man of Athens of all the Ships that entered into the Road, to
be his own: as if you should say, All the Fathers do patronize your Romish
Cause. We shall give you one or two Examples, among your Jesuits, as patterns
of the Disposition of others in neglecting, sleighting, and rejecting the more
General Consent of Fathers in their Expositions of Scriptures. One Instance
may be given in your Cardinal, who, in his Commentaries upon the Psalms,
dedicated to the then Pope, professes himself to have composed them, Bellarm.
Epist. Dedic. Paulo Quints, ante Comment. in Psalm. Psalmorum ego tractationem
magis propria meditatione, qua^ multa librorum lectione composui.
Rather by his own meditation, than by reading of many books; whereas he that
will seek for Unanimous Consent of Fathers, must have a perusal of them all.
In the second place hearken unto the Accents of your Jesuit Maldonate, in his
rejecting the Expositions of the Fathers, as for Example: Maldon. Ies. in
Matthew. 20. Existimant Patres filios Zebedaei temere respondisse, ego vero credo
eos vere esse locutos. Item in Matthew. 16. 18. Non praevalebunt] Quorum verborum
sensus non videtur mihi esse, quem omnes praeter Hilarium, quos legisse memini,
Authors putant. Item in Matthew. 11. 11. Variae sunt Patrum opiniones, sed (ut
libere fatear) in null a carum aquiesco. Item in Matthew. 11. 13. Prophetae and
lex] Omnes fere ve^eres ita exponunt, sed non est apta satis interpretatio.
Item Matthew. 19. 11. Non omnes capiunt, i. e. non omnes capimus: Sic omnes fere
veteres exponunt, quibus equidem non assentior. Item in Job. 6. 62 Sic quidem
expono, and licet Expositionis hujus Autorem nullum habeo, hanc tamen magis
probo, quam illam Augustini, caeterarumque alioqui probabilissima^^ quia hoc
cum CALVINISTARUM sensu magis pugnat.
So indeed said the Fathers, but I believe the Contrary. Item, This seems not
to me to be the Sense of this place, which All, whom I have read, except
Hilary, do think. Item, Their opinions are diverse, I rest upon none of them
All. Item, All Ancients almost do so expound this Text, but this is no fit
Interpretation. Item, Thus I expound this Scripture, and albeit I have no
Author of this Exposition, yet I do approve it rather than that of Augustine,
or of others, although otherwise most probable, even because it is repugnant to
the Sense and Exposition of the Calvinists. So he, and that usually. (O dura
ilia!) With what Stomach could this man swallow that O ath?

Salmeron the Jesuit may stand for the third upon that Text Romans 5. In whom
all have sinned, which teaches the universal Guilt of Original Sin of
mankind. What the Sense of the Fathers was from this Text, your Canus will
certify you; Canus loc. Theol. lib. 7. cap. 3. Sancti omnes qui in ejus rei
mentionem incidere, uno ore asseruerunt B. Virginem in originali peccato
conceptam fuisse. And then he reckons, adding: Et si nullus contravenet it;
infirmum tamen cx omnium autoritate Argumentu^.
All they (says he) who have formerly fallen upon this subject matter, have
confessed, as it were with one mouth, that the Virgin Mary was conceived in
original sin, no one contrarying this opinon. So he of the Judgment of
A^tiquity, which notwithstanding he durst contradict: but we return to your
Jesuit, who premising that this Question does belong to Faith, propounds
Salmeron Ies. in Romans 5. Disp 49. In quo omnes peccaverunt.] Mariam conceptam
in originali peccato, e^si^ non si^ haeresis daninata, nempe tam^ ad fidem
spectat. Item Disp. 51. A qua multitudine Patrum, locum ab autoritate infirmum,
and -- Pauperis est numerare pecus -- Exodus 13. In judicio plurimorum non
acquiesces sententiae, ut a vero demas: and multitudinem multitudini opponimus.
At Devoti erga D. Virg. Resp. Totam Devotionem e^ga illam non consiste^e in
Patribus, ut in Bernardo, etc. At Antiqui. Resp. Quilibet senex laudator
temporis acti: sed and illud asserimus quo juniores, eo perspicaciores Doctores
esse. After he wrangleth, and wresteth some savings of Fathers to his part, In
celeberrima Parisiensium Academia nullus in theologia titulo Doctoris dignus
habetur, qui non primum jusjurandi religione se adstrinxerit ad hoc Virginis
privilegium tuendum.
Objections made out of the Fathers, for proof that the Virgin Mary has the
same Original defect in her own natural Generation, and shapeth Answers full
of regret, and reluctance. For, first, To this Objection; The Fathers did
consen^: He answers thus; The Argument from Authority is infirm. 2. To
this; The Fathers were Ancient: Thus; The younger Divines are more quick of
understanding. 3. To this; The Fathers were many: he answers; He is but a
poor man that can number his Cattle. And again confronting the Ancient
Fathers, and preferring novell Divines, he says; We oppose multitude to
multitude. 4. But The Fathers were Devout: he answers; Yet all Devotion
toward the Blessed Virgin rests not in the Fathers. And when one of the
Devoutest of them (Bernard by name) is objected, who had said of the point now
in Question; Bernard. Epist. 174. Hanc prolis praerogativam B. Mariae tribuere
non est honorare Virginem, sed honori detrah^re. Et Paulo ante -- Nunquid
patribus doctiores, aut devotiores sumus?
To ascribe the prerogative of the Son to the Blessed Virgin is not an
honoring, but a dishonouring her: wherein the same holy Bernard appealeth to
Antiquity, saying, Are we either more learned, or more Devout than the
Fathers? Your Jesuit answering to him by name, casts him off with the Rest.

Here we see an Oath exacting a Consent to the Unanimous Expositions of
Fathers, and hear notwithstanding as plain a Dissent of your Jesuits
opposition unto Unanimous Consent of Fathers which is the ordinary guise of
your Disputers in their expounding of Scriptures: and yet behold you (forsooth)
the native children, and heirs of the Doctrine of Ancient Fathers. Your
Fathers of the Council of Trent have set it down for a Canon, whereunto you
are also sworn, that the words of Christ his Institution, concerning the
giving of his Body, and Blood, Book 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 1.
Have a plain, and proper signification without Tropes; which notwithstanding,
the same words of Christ have been evinced to be Figurative, not only by the
Unanimous Consent of Book 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 6. and Chap. 2. Sect. 6, and 7.
Antiquity, but also by the express Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 4. See also Book
3. Chap. 3. in the words, [The fruit of the Vine.] Sect. 5.
Confessions of your own Jesuits, in the words [Eate, Break, Cup, etc.] and
wherein your selves have acknowledged diverse Tropes. Besides, the whole former
Treatise is but a displaying of your unconscionable wresting of the Testimonies
of ancient Fathers. Ponder you these Observations with your selves, and then
judge whether your Swearing be not Perjury it self.

IV. Overture of Perjury, in the Defenders of the Romish Mass, is in respect
of the pretended Necessity of their Doctrine.

IN the last Clause of the Oath, prescribed in the Bull of Pope Pius IV. you
are sworn that every Article therein is the Sea above in this Sect. 4. initio,
at the letter (a).
True Catholic Faith, without which none can be saved; among which is the
Article already mentioned, swearing to whatsoever was declared in the Council
of Trent; by which Council your now Roman Synod. Trident. Sess. 1^.
Missall, or Masse-booke is approved. Now take a Taste of your Oath in every
Epithet. First, [True:] and hereby are you sworn that in the days of Pope
Innocentius the third, the Administration of the Eucharist to Infants was not
held necessary; which your own Authors have Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 11.
confessed, and proved to be false. Secondly, that the presence of them, who,
at the administration of the Eucharist, do not communicate, is Ibid. Sect. 5.
and Sect. 10.
Commendable, and held a Doctrine Catholic (that is) anciently Universal:
which was generally condemned by Ancient Fathers; and, even in the Church of
Rome it self, abandoned by two Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 9.
Popes.

Lastly, in the point of Necessity to Salvation; To swear that whosoever
believes not that one may be said to Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 5.
Communicate alone, is damned; that whosoever believes not that the Priest in
the Mass, being alone, cannot duly say, The Lord be with you, he is damned; or
that the Sea Book 4.
Body of Christ may not be run away with Mice, and be blown away with the
wind, he is damned; and a number other like extreme foolish Crotchets, set
down in your Missalls, which we willingly omit. The Sum of all these is,
that the same your Oath, made to damn others, does serve chiefly to make the
Swearers themselves most damnable. If peradventure any of you shall oppose,
saying that none of you within this Kingdom (which never admitted of the
Council of Trent, nor of the Bull of Pope Pius IV.) are yet bound to that
Oath, let him know that although this may excuse him from an Actual Perjury,
yet can it not free him from the Habitual, which is, that he is disposed in
himself to take it, whenever it shall be offered unto him in any Kingdom,
that does embrace and profess the same.

Our Last Advertisement follows.

Of the Mixture of many old Heresies with the former Defense of the Romish
Mass.

SECT. V.
THe more odious the Title of this Section may seem to be, the more studious
ought you to show your selves in examining the proofs thereof; that so you may
either confute, or confess them, and accordingly reassume, or renounce your
Romish Defense.

Heresy has a double aspect: One is when it is direct, having the express
terms of Heresy; the Other is oblique, and by consequence, when the Defense
does infer, or imply necessarily the same Heretical Sense, even as it may be
said of Treason. For to say that Caesar is not King, is a Treasonable speech
Directly, in a plain Sense; and to say that Tribute money is not due to
Caesar, is as Treasonable in the Consequence. Thus much being premised, we are
now to recognize such Errrours, wherein your Disputers may seem to have
accordance with old Heretics, which point we shall pursue according to the
order of the Books.

BOOK I. Wherein your Church is found altering almost the whole form of
Christ his Institution, and the Custom of the Catholic Church, descended
from the Apostles; which Presumption Pope Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 3.
Julius condemned in diverse, who sopped the Bread in the Chalice, and squeezed
Grapes in the Cup, and so received them: even as did the Ibid.
Artoryritae in mingling Bread with Cheese, censured for Heretics by your
Aquinas. In which Comparison your Aberration from Christ's Example is so much
greater than theirs, as you are found Guilty in defending Book 1. thorow-out.
Ten Innovations, for one.

2. Your Pope Gelasius condemned the Heretical Manichees, for thinking it
lawful not to receive the Cup in the Administration of the Eucharist, judging
it to be Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 7.
Greatly Sacrilegious: notwithstanding your Ibid.
Church authorizeth the same Custom of forbidding the Administration of the
Cup to fit Communicants.

3. As Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 10.
you pretend Reverence, for withdrawing the Cup; so did the Ibid. Sect. 10.
Aquarii forbear wine, and used only Water, under a pretense of Sobriety.

4. Sometime there may be a Reason to do a thing, when as yet there is no
right, nor Authority for him that does it: We therefore exact of you an
Authority for altering the Apostles Customs, and Constitutions; and are
answered that Book 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 4.
your Church has Authority over the Apostles Precepts. Iumpe with them, who
being asked why they stood not unto the Apostles Traditions, replied that Ibid.
They were herein above the Apostles, whom therefore Irenaeus reckons among
the Heretics of his Time.

BOOK II. It is not nothing, which has been observed therein (to wit) your
Reasoning, why you ought not to interpret the words of Christ [This is my Body]
Book 2. Chap. 3. thorowout.
literally; and why you urge his other saying [Except yo^ eat my flesh] Ibid.
for proof of Bodily Eating; so that your Priest may literally say in your
Mass, that The Body of Christ passes into your bellies and entr^ils, because
(forsooth) the words of Christ are Book 2. Chap. 3. Sect. 2.
Doctrinall. And have you not heard of one Nicodemus, who hearing Christ teach
that every man must be John 3.
Borne again, who shall be partaker of God's Kingdom; and that he expounding
them in a Literal Sense conceited a new Entrance into his Mothers womb, when
as nothing wanted to turn that his Error into an Heresy, but only
Obstinacy? But of the strong and strange Obstinacies of your Disputers, you
have received a full See above in this Book, Chap. 2. Sect. 3.
Synopsis.

BOOK III. After follows your Article of Transubstantiation. I. Your direct
profession is indeed to believe no Body of Christ, but that which was Borne of
the Virgin Mary. But this your Article of Transubstantiation of Bread into
Christ's Body, generally held, according to the proper nature of
Transubstantion, to be by Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 2.
Production of Christ's Body out of the Substance of Bread, it necessarrly
infers a Body (called, and believed to be Christ's) which is not Borne of
the Blessed Virgin, as S. Augustine has plainly Book 4. Chap. 4. Sect. (...).
taught; diversifying the Bodily thing on the Altar from the Body of Christ
borne of the Virgin. Therefore your Defense symbolizeth with the heresy of
Apollinaris, who taught a Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 2.
Body not Borne of the Virgin Mary.

Secondly, you exclude all judgment of Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 9.
Senses, in discerning Bread to be tr^ Bread, as did the Manichaei dicebant
Christum (...) esse verum hominem, sed phantasma quoddam. Pr^l. Ele^ch. Haret.
Manichees in discerning Christ's Body, which they thereupon held not to have
been a True, but a Fantastical Body. Tertullian also challenges the Verity
of Sense, in judging of Wine in the E^charist (after Consecration) in
confutation of the same Error in the Marcioni^es.

Thirdly, for Defense of Christ his invisible Bodily Presence, you profess
that (after Consecration) Bread is no more the same, but changed into the Body
of Christ: which Doctrine in very express words was bolted out by an E^tychian
Heretic, and instantly condemned by Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 12.
Theodoret, and as fully abandoned by Pope Gelas^.

BOOK IV. Catholic Fathers were in nothing more zealous, Ibid. Sect. 13.
than in defending the distinct properties of the two natures of Christ his
Deity, and Humanity, against the pernicious heresies of the Manichees;
Marcionites, E^tychians, and E^nomians; all of them diversely oppugning the
Integrity of Christ's Body, sometime in direct terms, and sometime by
irrefragrable Consequences; whether it were by gaine-saying the Finitenesse, or
Solidity, or else the complete Perfection thereof: wherein ^ow far ye may
challenge affinity or kindred with them, be you pleased to examine by this
which follows.

1. The Heretics, who undermined the property of Christ's Bodily Finitenesse,
said that it was in diverse places at once, (as is Book 4. Chap. 4. Sect. 6.
and Chap. 5. Sect. 3. and Chap. 6. Sect. 1.
confessed) even as your Church does now attribute unto the same Body of
Christ, both in Heaven, and in Earth, yea, and in Millions of distant Altars at
the same time; and consequently in all places whatsoever. Now whether this
Doctrine of Christ's Bodily Presence in many places at once was held of the
Catholic Fathers for Heretical, it may best be seen by their Doctrine of
the Existence of Christ's Body in one only place, not only Definitively, but
also Circumspectively: both which do teach an absolute Impossibility of the
Existence of the same in diverse places at once. And they were as zealous in
professing the Article of the manner of Christ's Bodily Being in place, as they
are in instructing men of the Article of Christ's Bodily Being, lest that the
denial of it is Bodily manner of being might destroy the nature of his Body. To
which end they have concluded it to be absolutely but in one place, sometime in
a Chap. 4. thorowout.
Circumspective Finitenesse, thereby distinguishing them from all created
Spirits; and sometime by a Definitive Termination, which they set down first
by Exemplifications, thus: Ibid. Sect. 6.
If Christ his Body be on Earth, then it is absent from Heaven; and thus, Being
in the Sun, it could not be in the Moon: Secondly, by diverse Comparisons,
for comparing the Creature with the Creator God, they Ibid.
conclude, that The Creature is not God, because it is determinated in one
place; and comparing the humane, and divine Nature of Christ together, they
Chap. 4. Sect. (...).
conclude, that they are herein different, because the humane and Bodily Nature
of Christ is necessarily included in one place: and la^tly comparing Creatures
with the Holy Ghost, they Chap. 6. Sect. (...).
conclude a difference by the the same Argument, because the Holy Ghost is in
many places at once; and all these in confutation of diverse Heretics. A thing
so well known to your elder Romish School, that it confessed the Doctrine of
Existence of a Body in diverse places at once (in the judgment of Antiquity) to
be Ibid.
Heretical.

2. The property of a Solidity likewise was patronized by Ancient Fathers, in
confutation of Heretics, by teaching Chap. 7. Sect. 6.
Christ's Body to be necessarily Palpable, against their Impalpabilitie: and to
have a Thickness, against their feigned subtle Body, as the Air: and
furthermore controlling these opinions following (which are also your
Crotchets) of a Bodies Chap. 7. Sect. 6.
Being whole in the whole space, and in every part thereof; and of Christ's
Body Chap. 4. Sect. 9.
taking the Right hand, or left, of it self.

3. The property of Perfection of the Body of Christ, wheresoever, in the
highest Degree of Absoluteness. This (one would think) every Christian heart
should assent unto, at the first hearing; wherefore if that they were judged
Heretics by Ancient Fathers, who Prateol. El^nch. ^^res. Tit. Philoponus
Alexandrinus. (...) Statuit mor^m resurrectionem esse, viz. rat^onalium
animaru^ cum corruptibili corpore indissolubilem unionem.
taught an Indivisible Union of men's souls with their Bodies naturally, still
subject to corruption after the resurrection; who can imagine that the holy
Catholic Fathers would otherwise have judged of this your general Tenet,
(viz. to believe a Body of Christ, now since his Glorification, which is
destitute of all power of natural motion, sense, appetite, or understanding)
otherwise than of a senseless, and Antichristian Deliration, and Delusion? Yea
and that which is your only Reason you allege, to avoid our Objection of
Impossibilities in such cases, (to wit) Book 4. Chap. 4. Sect. 6.
The Omnipotency of God, the same was the Pretense of Heretics of old, in
the like Assertions, which occasioned the Ancient Fathers to term the Pretense
of Omnipotency, Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect. 2.
The Sanctuary of Heretics: albeit the same Heretics, (as well as you)
intended (as a Father speaks) to magnify God thereby; namely, in believing
the Body of Christ, after his Ascension, to be wholly Spiritual. To which
Heretics the same Father readily answered, (as we may to you) saying, Chap.
4. Sect. 6. at (b and c).
When you will so magnify Christ, you do but accuse him of falsehood: not that
we do any whit detract from the Omnipotency of Christ, (far be this Spirit
of Blasphemy from us!) but that (as you have been instructed by Ancient
Fathers) the not attributing an Impossibility to God, in such Cases of
Contradiction, is not a diminishing, but an ample advancing of the Ibid.
Omnipotency of God.

BOOK V. Your Orall Eating, Gutturall Swallowing, and Inward Digestion (as you
have Book 5. thorowout.
taught) of the Body of Christ into your Entrails has been proved out of the
Fathers to be in each respect sufficiently Capernaiticall, and termed by them a
Sense both Chap. 5. Sect. 2.
Pernicious, and Flagitious. Besides you have a Confutation of the Heretical
Manichees, for their Book 5. Chap. 6. Sect. 3.
Opinion of Fastening Christ to men's guts, and loosing him again by their
belchings: Consonant to your Romish Profession both of Christ's Book 5. Chap.
7. Sect. 4.
Cleaving to the guts of your Communicants, and Book 5. Chap. 7. Sect. 1.
Vomiting it up again, when you have done.

BOOK VI. This is spent wholly in examining the Romish Doctrine of
Masse-Sacrifice, and in proving it to be Sacrilegiousnesse it self, as you
have seen in a former See above in this Book, Chap. 1. Sect. 2.
Synopsis.

BOOK VII. This contains a Discovery of your Masse-Idolatry, not only as
being equal with the Doctrine of some Heretics, but in one respect exceeding
the in^atuation of the very Book 7. Chap. 8. Sect. 2.
Pagans; besides the General Doctrine of the power of your Priests Chap. 5.
Sect. 3.
Intention, in consecrating, has been yoaked, by your own Jesuit, with the
Heresies of the Chap. 9. Sect. 5.
Donatists.

When you have beheld your own faces in these diverse Synopses, as it were in
so many glasses, we pray to God that the sight of so many and so prodigious
Abominations in your Romish Mass may draw you to a just Detestation of it, and
bring you to that true worship of God, which is to be performed in Spirit and
in Truth, and to the saving of every one of your souls, through his Grace in
Christ Jesus. AMEN.

ALL GLORY BE ONLY TO GOD.
