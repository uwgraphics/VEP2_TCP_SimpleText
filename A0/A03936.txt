Here ends the chapytours of the first book. And after follows the first
part of this present volume /
That the Inner having of man's soul should be like the utter Capitulum
primu^
GHostly suster in Ihesu christ I pray the yt in ye calling which our lord
has called yt to his service thou hold the paid. and stondested fastly therein
/ trauaylynge besely with al ye myghtes of thy soul by ye grace of Ihu^ christ
for to fulfill in sothfastnes of good living ye state which thou haste take in
lyknes and in semyng / And as thou have forsake the world: as it were a deed
man turned to our lord bodily in sight of men Right so yt in thyn heart might
be as it were deed to al erthly loves and dredes / turned holy to our lord
Ihu^ christ. For wit thou well a bodily tournynge to god without the heart
following. is but a figure and a lyknes of virtues. and no sothfastnes /
Wherefore a wretched man or woman is he or she that leuyth the Inwardly keeping
of himself / and shapeth hy^ without forth oonly a form and liknes of holiness:
in habyte or clothing / in speech and in bodily works: beholdynge other
men's deeds. and demynge her defawces / wenynge himself to be ought when he is
right not and so begyleth himself / Do thou not so. but turn thy heart with thy
body pryncipally to god / and shape the with in to his lycknes by mekenes and
charity. and other ghostly virtues. and then^e art thou truly turned to him / I
say not that thou so lightly on the first day may be tournyd in thy soul by
fulhede of virtues: as thou might with thy body be closyd in a house. but that
thou should know that the cause of thy bodily closing is / yt thou might the
beter come to ghostly closing / And as thy body is closyd fro bodily
conuersaco^n of men / right so that thyn heart might be enclosed fro the
flesshly loves and dredes of al ecthly things / And that thou might ye beter
come thereto. I shall tell the in this lytyl writing / as me thynkyth.

Of actyflyf. and the works thereof / Caplm ii
THou shate understood that there is in holy church two manner of lives as
saint gregory faith. Greg.
in y^ which christian they should be sauf / That one is called actyf. and the
other conte^plat if / without one of these ii. no man may be sauyd
Actyflyflyeth in love and charity showed outward by good bodily works i^
fulfyllynge of gods commandments / and of the.vii. works of mercy bodily
and ghostly to a man^es even christian. This life longs to all worldly men
which have richesse and plenty of worldly goods for to spend / And so to al
other the which have state office or cure of other men / And have goods for
to spend. lerid and lewd: temporel or spirytuel / And generally al wordly men
are bound to fulfylle it after her might and cu^nynge: as reason and discreco^n
asks / If he much good have / much good for to do / If he lytyl have.
less may he do / And if he naught have / then must he have a good will.
These ben works of actyflyf other bodily or ghostly / Also a great part of
actyflyflyeth in great bodily deeds. the which a man does to himself / as
great fasting. much waking / and other sharp penance doing for to
chastyse the flesh with dyscreco^n for trespace before done / And by such
penance for to refrain lusts and lykynges of it / and to make him buxu^ and
ready to the will of the spyryte / These works though they be^ actyf. they help
right much. and ordeneth a man in the beginning to come to co^templatyflyf /
if they be^ used with dyscrecyon.

Of conte^platyflyf and the works thereof. Caplm iii.
COnte^platyflyflyeth in perfyte love and charity felyd i^wardly by ghostli
virtues and by fothfast knowing and sight of god and ghostly things / This
lyflongeth to hem specially the which for the love of god forsakes al wordly
richesse worshyppes: and outward besynes / and holy yeuen hem body and soul
after her might and cunning to the seruyse of god by ghostly ocupaco^n / Now
then sith it is so that thy state asks for to be conte^platyf / for that
is the^tent of thy enclosynge: that thou might more freely and enteerly give the
to ghostly ocupaco^n. Then behouyth the for to be right besye both night and
day with traueyle of body and of spyrite: for to come to that life as nygh as
thou may by such means as thou hopest were best to the. Nevertheless before
that I tell the of the means: I shall tell the tyrst a lytyl more of this life
conte^platyf: that thou might somewhat se what it is / and sythen set it as a
mark i^ the sight of thy soul: whereto thou shall draw in all thyn occupacyon.

Of the first part of coutemplacyon / Caplm iiii
COntemplatyflyf has three parts / The first lies in knowing of god and
ghostly things geten by reason: by techyng of man: and by study in holy wryt
without ghostly affecco^n and Inly savor felyd. by ye specyal yefte of the
holy ghost / This part have specially lettred men and great clerks which by
long study and trauaylle in holy writ comen to this knowing more or less
after ye subtylte of kyndly wit and co^tynuau^ce of study. of the general wit
yt god yeueth to every man yt has use of reason / This knowing is good / and
it may be called a part of conte^placo^n. in asmoche as it is a sight of
sothfastnes. and a knowing of ghostly things Neue^^theles it is but a figure
and a shadow of very conte^plac^^on / for it has not ghostly savor in god:
ne inwardly swetnes / the which no man may feel but if he be i^ great charity
/ For it is the proper well of our lord / to the which comes none alien.
but this manner knowing is common to good and vadde / for it may be had without
charity: and therefore it is not very conte^placo^n / As often sithes ypocrytes
and flesshly living men have more such knowing than many other cryste^ men.
and yet have these men to charity. Of this manner knowing spykyth saint poul
thus / Si habuero oe^m sciencia^. Cor 13
and nouerim misteria oi^a. caritate^ auce^ no^ habea^. nihil su^. If I had full
knowing of al things. and I knew al preuytees. and I had not charity. I am ryt
naught / Nevertheless if they y^ have this knowing keep hem i^ mekenes and in
charity: and flee worldly and flesshly sins after her might: Greg.
it is to hem a good way and a great dysposynge to very conte^placio^ / if they
desire and pray devoutly after the grace of the holy ghost / Other men y^ have
this cu^nyng and turns it to pride and vaynglory of he^self / or in to
couetyse and desiring of worldly states. worshyps and riches / not mekely
taking it to the praysyng of god ne charitably spe^deth it in ye profit of her
eue^strysten. some of he^ fallen other into heresies and errors / or in to
other open sins / by y^ which they sclau^der he^self and al holy church /
Of this cu^nynge says saint poul thus. Scie^cia in flat. caritas aute^
edeficat / knowi^g alone lyfteth up the heart into pride / but me^ge it with
charity: and then turns it in to edifycaco^n / This knowing alone is but
water unsavory and cold / And therefore if they yt have it would mekely offer
it up to our lord / and pray him of grace / he should with his blessyng turn
the water in to wine / as he did at ye prayer of his mother at the fest of
Archetryclyne / that is for to say / He should turn the unsavory knowing into
wysdom. and the cold naked reason in to ghostly light and brennynge love by
the yeft of the holy ghost /

Of the ii. part of contemplaco^n / Caplm v
THe ii. part of conte^placo^n lies pryncypally i^ affection without light of
understanding o^ ghostly things / and this is comynly of simple and
vnle^^tred men / which yeuen hem holy to devotion. and this is felyd on this
manner / when man or woman in medi^taco^n of god by the grace of ye holy ghost
felyth feruou^ of love and ghostly swetnes by ye mind of crystys passo^^^ or
any of his works in his manhede / or he felyth a gr^^te trust in the goodness
and i^ the mercy of god for the fory^^uenes of his sins: and for his great
yeftis of grace. or else he felyth a dread in his affecco^n with great reverence
of the preuy domes of god / the which he sees not / and of his ryghtwysnes or
in prayer he felyth the thought of his heart draw up fro al erthely things.
strenyd together with all the myght^s of his heart: vpstyeng to our lord by
fervent desire and with ghostly delight And never theles in that time he has no
open sight in understanding of ghostly things ne of pryuytees of holy wryt in
specyal / but only that him thinks for the time no thing lyketh him so
much as for to pray or think as he does. for savor delight and comfort that
he fyndeth there in / And yet can he not tell what it is. but he felyth it well
for it is a yeft of god For out of it spryngen many sweet teres: bre^nynge
desires / and stylle mourni^ges. which scoureth and cleanses the heart fro all
the fylth of sin / and makes it melte in to wonderful swetnes of Ihesu
christ. buxum soople: and ready to fulfill all goddys will / Insomoche that him
thynkyth he makith no charge what comyth of himself / so that goddys will were
fulfilled with such many styrynges mo than I can or may say This feeling may
not be had without great grace / and who so has it for the time he is in
charity / which charity may not be lost ne lessed though the fervor of it
pas^e away: but by a dedely syn / and yt is comfortable. This may be called
ye.ii. part of co^te^placio^ / nevertheless these part has.ii degrees

Of ye lower degree of ye ii. part of co^te^placo^n / ca. vi:
THe lower degree of this feeling. me^ which are actyff may have by grace wha^
they be^ vysyted of our lord as myghtely and as fervently as they ye give hem
holy to conte^platyf life and has this yeft. but this feeling in his fervor
comith not always wha^ a man would ne it lastyth not full long. It comyth and
gooth as he will that yeueth it / and therefore who so has it* meke himself. and
thank god: and keep it preuy* but if it be to his confessor / and hold he it
as long as he may with descreco^n / And wha^ it is withdrawn dread not to
much. but sto^de sadly in faith and in a meke hope / with pacye^ce abydy^ge
till it come again / This is a lytyl tastynge of the swetnes of the love of god /
of the which david says thus in the sawter / Gustate and videte qm^ suauis
est dn^s / Taast P. xxxiii.
ye and se ye the swe^nes o^ our lord /

Of the hyer degree of the ii. part of conte^placo^n. Ca. vii
THe hyer degree of this part may not be had and holden but of hem the which
be^ in great rest of body and soul / the which by grace of Ihu^ and long
traueyle bodily and ghostly felyth a rest of heart and clennes in conscience. so
y^ hem lyken no thing so much for to do as to sy^te stylle in rest of body /
and for to always pray to god. and think on our lord. and to think sometime on
the blessed name of Ihesu which is comfortable and deleccable to hem / that by
the mind of it they felen hem fed in her affecco^n / And not only of ye
name / but al other manner prayers: as the Pater noster and the Auee / or ympnes
or psalms and other devout sayenges of holy church are turned as it were in
to a ghostly mirthe and sweet song / by ye which they are comforted and
stre^gthed against alsynnes. and much releued of bodily desese. Of this degree
spekith saint poul thus. Ephe^. v.
Nolite inebriari vico: sed i^pleamini sp^u sco^. loquentes vobis metip^is in
ympnis and canticis and psalmis spu^alibus. cantantes and psalle^tes in
cordibus vr^is dn^o / Be ye not dronken with wine / but be ye fulfilled of ye
holy ghost saying to yourself in ympnes and psalms and gostly so^ges: singing
and psalmynge in your hertes to our lord / Who so has this grace keep he
himself in lownes / and that he be ever desiring for to come to more knowing
and felyng of god in the third part of co^templaco^n /

Of the third part of contemplacyon / Caplm viii.
THe third part of conte^placion the wiche is perfyte as it may here lies
both in cognyco^n and in affecco^n. That is to say / in knowing and in perfyte
loving of god. And that is when a ma^nys soul first is reformed by fulhede of
virtues to the image of Ihu^ / And afterward wha^ he is vysyted he is taken in
fro al erthly and flesshly affecco^ns: fro vain thoughts and ymagyninges of
al bodily creatures / and as it were much rauysshed out of the bodily wits /
And then by ye grace of the holy ghost is illumined for to see by
understanding soth fastnes which is good and ghostly things with a soft
sweet bre^nynge love in him so perfytly that he be rauysshed of his love / so
the soul is onyd for the time and co^formyd to the image of the trynyte / The
begyn^ynge of this conte^placo^n may be felyd in this life / but the fulhede of
it is kept into ye bliss of heaven. Of this onynge and conformynge to our lord
spekyth saint poul thus / Qui adhe ^t deo. vnus sp^s e^ cu^ illo / that is to
say / Who so by rauysshynge of love is fastened to god: then god and his soul
are not two. but both one / And sothly in this onynge is ye marriage made
betwyxt god and the soul the which shall never be broken.

Of the twyn^ynge of the iii: part of conte^placo^n fro the ii. part of the
praysynge thereof / Caplm^. ix
THe other part may be called brennynge love in devotion / and this bre^nynge
love in conte^placyon. y^ is lower. this is ye hyer. that is swetter to the
bodily feeling / this inwardly feeling better to the ghostly feeling. For it is
more i^warde: more worthy: more ghostly: more wondful / for this is verily a
tastyng so lytyl as is a ernest of the sight of heavenly joy: not clerly. but
half in derkenes. the which shall be fulfilled and openly clered in the bliss
of heaven. i. little. iz.
as saint poulsayth / Uide mus nu^c per spclm i^ enigmate, tu^c aute^ videbimus
facie ad facie^ / We see now god by a myrrour as it were in a derknes / but in
heaven shall we see openly face to face. This is the illuminaco^n of
understanding in delytes of loving as david says in the sawter / Et nox
illu^inacio mea in delicus meis / My night is my light in my delytys. psalm c.
xviii
The other part is milk for children / this is hole mete for perfyte men: the
which have wits assayde to know good fro evil: Hebr^. v.
as saint poul says / perfectorume^ solidus cibus. qui he^nt se^sus
exercitatos ad discreco^em boni and mali / The werkynge of the full use of this
yefte may no man have but he be first reformed to y^ lyknes of Ihu^ by fulhede
of virtues / Ne there may no man living in dedely flesh have it contynuelly
in his fulhede and in the ouerpassynge: but by times when he is vysyted / And
as I conceive by the writing of holy men it is a fulshort time for soon after
he falls in sobyrte of ^odely feeling / and all this work makyth charity /
Thus as I understand says saint poul of himself / Sieve excedimus deo. sieve
sobr^ sumus vobis caritas xp^i vrgit nos / Whether we over pass our bodily
wits to god in conte^placo^n. or we are more sobyr to you in bodily feeling.
the charity of christ streyneth us. Of this part of conte^placo^n and of
reformynge to god spekyth saint poule openly thus / Nos aute^ reuelata facie
glaz dn^ispeclam^ transformati in cande^ ymagine^ a claritate i^ claritate^
ta^quamm a dn^isp^u. And this is thus much for to say Saint poule in ye
person of himself and of perfyte men says thus / We first reformed by
virtues. the face of our soul vnheled by opening of the ghostly eye beholden
as in a myrrour heavenly joy. full shapyd and onyd to the image of our lord fro
clerete of faith into clerete of understanding / or else fro clerete of desire
in to clerete of blessed love / and al this is wrought of the spyryte of our
lord in a mannys soul as saint poule says: This part of conte^placo^n god ye
uith where yt he will / to leryd and to lewd: to men and to wy^ men ocupyed i^
prelacye. and to solytary also / But it is specyal not common and also though a
man which al his life is actyf have the yeft of it by a specyal grace /
nevertheless the fulness of it may no man have but he be solytary and in life
conte^platyf /

How ye showing to the bodily wits and the feeling of hem may be both good
and evil. Ca. x.
BY this y^ I have said may thou so^what vndstonde that vysyo^s or reuelacyons
of any manner of spyryte in bodily aperynge. or in ymaginynge slepynge or
wagynge / or else any other feeling in the bodily wyttys made as it were
ghostly. other in sownynge of ere: or sauerynge in the mouth: or smelling at
ye nose: or else any se^syble hete as it were fire glowynge and warming ye
breast or any other part of the body / or any other thing yt may be felyd by
bodily wit though it be never so confortable and liking / they ben not very
co^te^placo^n / ne they be^ but sy^ple and secu^dary though they ben good in
reward of ghostly virtues and of this ghostly knowing and loving of god / But
al such manner of felyng may be good / wrought by a good au^gel / and they may
be deceyuable / wrought by a wicked au^gel. Wha^ he tra^sfyguryth him in to an
au^gel of light / Wherefore sith they may be both good and evil it seems well
they are not ye best. For wite thou well yt the devil may wha^ he has leave
feyne of bodily feeling the lykenes of ye same things the which a good au^gel
may work / For right as a good au^gel comyth with light: so can the devil /
And so of y^ other wits / who so had felid both / he should well tell which
were good and which were evil But he that never felyd neither: or else but y^
one: may lightly be deceived / They are like in ye manner of feeling outward:
but they are full diverse within / And therefore they are not for to desire
greatly / ne for to receive lightly / but if a soul might by the spyryte of
dyscreco^n know the good fro the evil yt he were not begyled as saint John^
says / Nolite credere om^isp^ui. sed proba re siex deo sit / Saint John^
beddeth us that we should not trust to every spyryte but we shall assaye first
whether he be of god or no / wherefore by one allay I shall tell the as me
thinks how thou shall know the good fro evil.

How thou shall know wha^ the showing to the bodily wyttis and feeling of hem
be^ good or evil. Ca xi
IF it so be yt thou see any manner of light or bryghtnes with the bodily eye /
or in ymaginynge other than every man see / or if thou here any merry wonderful
sownynge with bodily ere. or in thy mouth any sweet soden savor other tha^ of
kind. or any hete i^ thy breast. as it were fire. or any manner delight in any
part of thy body / or if a spyryte bodily aperyth unto ye as it were an aungel
for to comfort the. and teache ye or any such feeling which thou know well
ye it comith not of thyself ne of no bodily creatnre / beware in ye time or
sone after and wisely behold ye styrynge of thy heart: If thou be styrred by
cause of ye liking yt thou felyst to draw out thy heart fro ye mind and
beholding of Ihesu christ and fro ghostly ocupacyon: As fro prayer and thinking
on thy self and thy defawtes / fro thi^warde desire of virtues and of ghostly
knowing and felyng of god / For to set ye sight of thy heart and thy affecco^n
/ thy delight and thy rest pryncypally therein / wenyng yt it should be a part of
heavenly joy and of angels blys / and for thy y^ thi^kith yt thou sholdest
another pray ne think not else but al holy tente thereto for to keep it and
delight therein / This feeling is suspect and of the^mye / and therefore though it
be never so liking and wonderful. refuse it and assent not thereto / for this
is the sleyght of the^mye when he sees a soul that would inteerly give it to
ghostly ocupacyo^ he is wo^derly wroth / For he hates no thing more then for
to see a soul in a body of syn^e to feel verily the savor of ghostly knowing
and the love of god. ye which he without body of sin lost wylfully / And
therefore if he may not let him by open sy^nes. he would hinder him and begile
him hy such vanyte of bodily ^auours: or swetnes in ye wits for to bry^ge a
soul in to ghostly pride and in to a falls sykernes of himself / wenynge yt he
had thereby a feeling of heavenly Joy: and that he were half in paradyse for
delight that he felyth about him: when he is nere at hell yates / And so by
pride and by presu^pcyon he might fall in errors or heresies or faresyes. or
i^ other bodily or ghostly myschenes / Nevertheless if it be so that this manner
of feeling let not thy heart fro grostly ocupacyon / but it makyth the more
devout and more fervent for to pray / it makyth the more wise for to think
ghostly thoughts / And though it be so that it astonye the in ye begyn^ynge
nevertheless afterward it turns and quyckeneth thyn heart to more desire of
virtues / and encrenseth thy love more to god and to thyn even christian / Also
it makyth ye more meke in thyn own sight. By these tokens may thou know that
it is of god made by the presence and the touching of a good au^gel / and that
is of the goodness of god either in comfort of simple devout souls for to
increase her trust and her desire to god for to seek thereby the knowing ye
love of god more perfytly for such a comfort / or else if they ben perfyte that
felen such delight: it semith then that it is an ernest and as it were a
shadow of the gloryfyenge of the body which it shall have in ye bliss of
heaven / I wot not whether there be any such man living in earth / This
preuylege had mary mawdeleyne as it semyth to my sight i^ ye time wha^ she was
alone in the cave.xxx. winter / and every day was borne up with angels and was
fed both body and soul by the presence of hem: thus we read in y^ story of her
/ Of this manner assayenge of werkynge of spyrytes speaks saint John^ in his
pistle thus. and techeth thus / O i^ssp^s qui sol uit thm^. hic non e^ ex deo.
Every speryte y^ losyth or vnknyttith Ihu^. he is not of god / thise words may
be understand in many manners / Nevertheless after one manner I may understand
hem to this purpose that I have said.

What knytteth Ihesu to man's soul: and what loses him therfro / Caplm xii.
THe knyttynge and ye fasting of Ihu^ to a man's soul: is by good will and
great desire to him only for to have him and see him i^ his bliss ghostly /
The more ye this desire is. the faster is Ihu^ knytte to the soul. The less
that this desire is the loslyer is he knytte. The^ what spyryte or what feeling
yt it be yt which lesseth this desire and would draw it down fro the
steadfast mind of Ihu^ christ. and fro ye kyndly styenge up to Ihu^ this spyryte
will vnknytte ihu^ fro ye soul: and therefore it is not of god: but it is the
werkynge of the^mye / Nevertheless if a spyryte or a feeling or a reuelacio^
make this desire more. knytte ye knottes of love and deuocyo^ to ihu^ faster:
and open the eye of ye soul in to ghostly knowing more clerly: and makes it
more meke in it self this spyryte is of god / Here may thou see so^what yt thou
shall not suffer thy here wylfully for to rest ne for to delight holy in no
bodily feeling of such manner co^fortes or swetnes thou they were good. but
thou shall hold hem i^ thy sight nout or lytyl in reward of ghostly desire
and on steadfast thinking on Ihu^ / ne fest the thought of thy heart ouermoche
on he^ /

How and in what things should a conte^platyf man be ocupyed / Calm. xiii.
BUt thou shall ever seek by great besynes in prayers that thou might come to
the ghostly felyng of god: And y^ is y^ thou might know the wisdom of god /
the endless might of him / the great goodness of hy^ in himself and in his
creatures / For this is conte^placyo^ and that other is none. Ep^h. iii.
thus says saint poul / In car^^ate radicati and fu^dati. vt possitis
co^prehe^dere cu^ oi^bus sci^s que sic longitudo and la^itudo. suolimitas and
profu^du^ / Be ye roted and grounded in charity that ye might know he says
neither sou^de of the ere ne sweet favor in ye mouth: ne none such bodily
thing. but that ye might know and feel with all halowes which is the length
of ye endless being of god / the bread of the wonderful charity and the goodness
of god / the heyth of the almighty mageste of him and the groundles depnes o^
the wysdom of god In knowing and ghostly feeling of these should be the
occupacyon of the contemplatyf man / For in these may be understand the full
knowing of al ghostly things This ocupacyon is that one thing the which
saint poul coueyted saye^ge thus / Unu^ que retro su^t obliuisce^s. Phil iii.
in anteriora me extenda^. sequorsi quo modo comp^henda^ supernu^ braniu^ /
Thus much is to say / ^o thing. as hoo says. is best to me for to coueyte /
and yt is yt I might forgete al things yt which ben behyndwarde or backewarde
/ and I shall stretche out mine heart forward for to feel and to grype the
souereyne mede of the endless bliss / Hynwarde are al bodily things / Forward
are ghostly things / And for saint poul would forgete al bodily things: and
his own body also. with that you he might see ghostly things /

How in reason and will virtue begins. and in love and in lykyng it is made
perfyte. Caplm xiiii
NOw I have told you a lytyl of contemplaco^n what it should be: For this
intent that thou might know it and set it as a mark before ye sight of thy
soul and for to desire al thy lyftyme to come to any part of it by grace of
our lord Ihesu christ / This is the conformynge of a soul to god / the which
may not be had but if it be first reformyd by fulhede of virtues turned in to
affeccion. and that is when a man loves virtues. for they ben good in he^self
/ There is many a man that loves virtue of lownes. pacyence and charity to his
euencrysten. and such other only in his reason and will / and has no^ ghostly
delytene love in hem / For of times he felith grutchynge. heaviness and bytternes
for to do hem / And nevertheless yet he does hem only by styrynge of reason
for dread of god / this man has virtues in reason and in will / but not love
of hem in his affection.

But when by grace of Ihesu and by ghostly and bodily exercise reason is
turned in to light: And will into love. Then has he virtues in affection /
For he has so well gnawen on the bitter bark of the notte that he has
broken it: And fedeth him with the kyrnell / That is to say / The virtues
which were first heavy for to do: are now turned into a very delight and
savor: as when a man lyketh ^n mekenes. in pacyens. in clennes: in sobyrte.
And in charity. as in any delytes / Sothlytyll these virtues ben turned thus in
to affec^ion. he may well have the ii. part of contemplacyon / But the three
soth fastly shall he not take /

Of the means that bryngethe a soul to contemplation / Capitulum. xv
Now sythen virtues are dysposinge to contemplatyon. then it behouyth the
use certain means for to come to virtues \ Three means there ben which men
most comynly vsen that yeuen hem to contemplacyon As redynge of holy writ
and of holy techynge. ghostely meditacyon. and besye prayer with deuocyo^. By
medytacyo^ shall thou see as I said ehy wretchydnes / thy sins. and thy
wyckydnes / As pride couetyse. gloteny slothe. and lecherye. and wicked
styrynge of envy. ire. hatred. and malencolye: angrynes. yt byttenes and
unskillful heaviness / Thou shall also se thy heart fulof vain shames and dredes
of thy flesh and of the world / All these styrynges wyllen always boylle
out of thy heart a water will run out of the of the spring of a stynkynge
well. And let the syghte of thy soul that thou may never see ne feel
derely the love of Ihesu christ. For wy^e thou well till thy heart be much
clensyd through stable troth and besye beholdynge of crystes manhede fro such
sins. thou may not have ghostly knowing of god perfytly wytnessynge himself
in the gospel thus. Bti^ mu^do cord qm^ ip^i deu^ videb^t Blessed be clean of
heart. Math v.
for they shall se god Also in medytacyo^ thou shall see virtues which be nedful
to the for to have. as mekenes: myldnes: pacyence. ryghtwysnes: ghogly strength
temperaunce: clennes* pees: and sobernes: faith: hope: and charity* These
virtues thou shall see in meditacyon. how good how fair how profitable they
ben / and by prayer thou shall desire hem and get hem. without which thou may
not be contemplatyf. For Job says thus. Inhabunda^cia i^gredieris sepulcru^.
That is to say* Job. v
thou shall in plente of good bodily werkys and gostly virtues enter thy grave.
that is ye rest in contemplacyon /

What a man should use and refuse by the virtue of mekenes / Cplm xvi
NOw if thou sholdest use wisely gostly works and sykerly travail in he^. the
behouith to begin right low / Three things yt needs to have first. upon the
which as on a siker ground thou shall set al thy work thise iii. are mekenes:
siker faith. and hole intent to god First ye behouyth to have meknes in this
manner / thou shall hold thyselfe in thy will and in thy feeling if thou may
unable to dwell among men. and unworthy to serve god in couersacyon with his
seruauntys unprofitable to thy euencrysten: wantynge both cunning and might to
fulfill good works of actyflyf in help of thy eue^crysten: as other men and
wym^en done. And therefore as a wretch and outcaste: and refuse of al men and
wymmen are sperred in a house alone / yt thou sholdest dear ne grieve no man or
woman by enyl ensampse. sith thou can not profit he^ by good werkyng / Over
this the behooves to look ferder yt sith thou art so unable to serve our lord
by bodily works outward. Tren^. iiii.
how much more behooves the to hold ye unable and unworthy to serve him
ghostly by inward ocupacyon / For our lord is a spyryte as the prophet
layth. Sp^s ante faciemntam xp^s dn^s Before our face a ghost is our lord
christ / and the kyndly seruyse to him is ghostly / as he says hy^self: Ioh.
iiii.
Ueri adorantes adorabu^t pre^m in^p^u and veritate / Sothfast servants shall
worship him in spyryte and sothfastnesse / Then thou that art so boystous. so
lewd: so flesshly: so blind in ghostly things / and namly of thyn own
soul: which the behouyth first to know if thou sholdest come to the knowing
of god / How sholdest thou then^e feel thyself able or worthy for to have
state or lyknes of contemplatyf life / the which life as I have said lies
pryncypally in ghostly knowing: and felyng of god This I say to the: not yt
thou sholdest for think thy purpose. and be myspayde with thy clothinge. but
yt thou sholdest feel this lownes fothfastly in thy heart if thou might / for it
is soth and no lees / And then thou shall desire night and day after thy might
for to come as nere as thou may to ye state which thou haste take. trowynge
steadfastly that it is best to the by the mercy of god. for to traueyle in / And
though it be so that thou may not come to the fulhede of it here in this life.
yt thou might be in the beginning of it. and trust sykerly for to have the
fulhede by the mercy of god in the bliss of heaven / For sothly that is my life
/ I feel me so wretched and so frail and flesshly / and so far fro true
felyng fro that you I speak: that I cannot else but cry mercy. and desire
after as I may with an hope yt our lord will bring me thereto in the bliss of
heaven / Do thou so: and beter after that god yeuyth ye grace / The feeling of
this lownes shall put out of thyn heart vnshylful beholdynge of other men^es
deeds / and it shall drive the holy to behold thyselfe / as there were no man
living but god and thou / And thou shalde me and hold thyself more vile and
more wretch tha^ is any creature yt beryth life. that uneath shall thou suffer
thyself for the gretnes and no^bre of sin and fylthe that thou shall feel in
the / Thus behouyth ye for to feel sometime if thou wylt be very meke. For I
tell the sothly. if thou will be truly meke thou shall think a venyal sin
in thiself more grievous and paynful to the and greter be in thy sight sometime
than great dedly sins of other men / This is soth to the if thou will be
conte^platyf. for this skyl / That thing the which puts the soul or
lettyth it most fro the feeling and knowing of god: owes to be most grievous
and paynful to ye / But a venyalsynne of thyself lettyth the more fro the
feeling and perfyte love of Ihesu christ than other man's sin may do: be it
never so much Seems it then that thou should more arise in thyn own heart
against thiself for to hate and deem in thyself all manner of sin which
lettyth the fro the sight of god / more than against yt defawtes of other men /
For if thyn heart be clean of thyn own sins / sothly the sins of al other
men should not dear the. And therefore if thou will find rest here and in the
bliss of heaven / after the counsel of one of the holy faders say every day
what am I / and deem thou no man /

Who should blame men's defawtes and deem hem. and who not / Caplm xvii
BUt now see thou. how may this be / sith it is a deed of charity for to
blame men of her defawtes / and for to deem hem for her amendynge it is a deed
of mercy / As to this I answer as me thynkith / that to the or to any other
the which has state and purpoos of life contemplatyf it falls not for to
leave the keeping of hemselfe / and for to behold and to blame other men of her
defawtes / but if it were full great need / so that a man should perysshe but
if thou blamyd him / But ye men which are actyf. and have soueraynte and cure
over other as prelates and curates and such other: they are ^ounde by their
office and by way of charity for to see and seek. and deem ryghtfully other
men's desawtes Not of desire and delight for to chastyse hem. but oonly for
need with dread of god and in his name. for love of salvation of her souls /
Other men that are actyf and have no cure of other men. they are bound for to
blame other men of her defawtes by the way of charity only that when the sin
is dedely / and it may not well be corrected by none other man and wha^ he
trowyth that he the sooner should be amended by his vndertakynge Else it is
beter that we cesse. That this is soth it semyth by saint John^ which held
the state of contemplatyf life. and saint peter which had the state of
actyflyf. Wha^ our lord in his last sowper with his dyscyples at the preuy
stirynge of saint peter to saint John^ told saint John^ how Judas should
bytraye him / sayt John^ told it not to saint peter as he askid / but he
turned him and laid his h^ed upon christ is breest. and was arauysshed by love
in to contemplacyon of goddis priuytees. And so medefully to him / that he
forgate both Judas and saint peter / in tokenynge and techynge to other men
which would be cuotemplatyf. that they should dyspose hem to do the same.

Why men should worship other and low hemself in her own heart under al other.
Caplm xviii:
THen see thou here somewhat that thou shall another deem other men / ne
conceive against hem wylfully none evil suspycyon / but thou shall love hem ne
see thou no defawte in hem / and worship hemi^ thy heart such as ledeth in the
world accyflyt / and suffren many tri^ulacyons and temptacyons which thou
sittinge in thy house felyst naught of / And they have full much traueyle and
disese for her own and other men's sustynaunce / and many of hem had well
lever serve god if they might as thou do in bodily rest / And nevertheless
they in her worldly ^esynes flee many sins / the which if thou were in her
state thou sholdest fall in / and they do many good deeds which thou cowde
not do / It is no doubt that many done thus. which they ben. thou wost not \
And therefore thou shall worship al and set hem in thy heart all above the as
thy souerayns / and cast the down under her fete that thou be vylest and
lowest in thyn own sight: for it is no dread ne no peril to the how much
thou may low thyself bynethe al other. though it were so that in goddis sight
thou had more grace than any other. But it is peril to the to hye the and
lift thiself in thy thought wylfully above any other man / though he were the
most wretch: or the most synful cay^yf that is in earth / For our lord
says. Qui se huliat exaltabitur. et qui exaltat huliatur / Who so hyeth
himself. Luc. xiiii.
he shall be lowed. and who so lowyth himself. he shall be hyed / This part of
mekenes the behooves for to have in thy beginning / and by this and by grace
shall thou come to the fulhede of it and so of all other virtues For Who so
has one virtue. he ha^h al other virtues. Asmoche as thou have of meknes.
somoche as thou have of charity. of pacyence. and of other virtues though they
ben not showed outward / Be then besye to get mekenes: and hold it for it is
the first and the last of al virtues / It is the first: for it is the ground
as ^aynt austyn says / If thou think for to bylde an hye house of virtues /
ordeyne yt first a deep ground of mekenes. Also it is the last / for it is
keeping and saving of all other virtues / saint gregory says / He ye gadreth
virtues without mekenes. he is like to him yt which makyth and beryth powder
of spicery in the wind / Do thou never so many good deeds / fast thou wake
thou. ar any other good work do thou / if thou have no mekenes / it is naught
that thou do /

How men should do yt wanten ye feeling of mekenes in affecco^n not dredyng to
much therefore / Caplm xix
Nevertheless if thou may not feel this mekenes in thyn heart with affection as
thou would do as thou may meke thyself in will by reason / trowynge that it
should be so as I say / though thou feel it not: And in that hold the a more
wretch that thou may not feel sothfastly thy self as thou ar^e / And if thou
do so. though thy flesh rise there again and will not assent to thy good
will. be not to much adrad. but thou shall bear and suffer the false feeling of
thy flesh as a pain / and then thou shall despise and repreue that
feeling. and break down that rysynge of thyn heart: as thou would be well
paid for to be trodden and spourned under other mennesfete. And so by ye grace
of Ihu^ christ through steadfast thinking on the mekenes of his precious manhede
shall thou aba^emoche ye styrynges of pride / and ye virtue of mekenes that was
first in thy nakyd will shall be turned in to feeling of affection / without
which vert^e either in true will or in feeling who so dyspose him to serve god
in conte^platyflyf as the blind he shall sto^ble and he shall never come thereto
/ The hyer he clym^yth by bodily penance / and other virtues / and has not
this mekenes Greg.
ye lower he falls / For as saint gregory says / He that can not perfytly
despise himself / he found never yet ye meke wysdom of our lord Ihesu christ /

How ypocrytes and heretykes for lackyng of mekenes hyen hemself in her hret
above al other / Caplm xx
yPocrytes ne heretics feel not this mekenes neither in good wylne in
affeccyo^ / but full dry and full cold arn her hertes and her reins fro ye
soft feeling of this virtue / and in so much the ferder they be^ fro it. that
they wene that they have it / They gnawe on the dry bark without: but the
sweet kernel of it and the inly savor may they not come to / They show
outward mekenes in habyte and holy speech. in lowly berynge / and as it semyth
in many bodily and ghostly virtues / but nevertheless in the will and in
thaffeccyon of her heart where mekenes should be: it is faint / For they deem
and despysen and setten at naught other men that will not do as they done and
teache / they holden hem either foles by vncu^nynge or blinded by flesshly
living And therefore lift they he^self upon hye in her own sight above al
other. wenynge yt they live better than other: and that they have only ye
sothfastnes of good living: and in ghostly feeling and synguler grace of god
both in knowing and in ghostly feeling passing other men / And in this sight
of hemself ryseth a delight in her hertes in the which they worship and praise
hemself: as there were none but they They pray len and tha^ken god with her
lyppes. but in her hertes they stele^ as thieves ye worship and the tha^kyng fro
god. and settyth it in he^self. and so they have another mekenes in feeling ne
in will / A wretchyd caytyf or a sinner which falls al day. and he is sorry
that he does so though he have not mekenes in affection / he has it in a good
will / But an heretic or an ypocrite has neither / For they have the
condycyon of the pharyse / which came as our lord says in the gospel with
the publycan in to the temple for to pray. And when he came he prayed not ne
asked ought of god. for him thought he had no need. but he began to thank god
and said thus / Lord I thank the that thou yeuest me grace more than to other
that I am not as other men be / robbers lechours / or other such sinners / And
he lokyd beside him and saw the publycan which he knew for a wretch:
knocking on his breast only cryenge after mercy / thenue he thanked god yt he
was not such one as he was / for lord he said I fast twyes in the weke / and
I pay truly my tithes / And when he had do. our lord said that he yede home
again without grace as he came. and gate right naught / But now say thou.
wherein trespassyd this pharyse sith he thanked god and was soth that he said /
as to this I answer and say that this pharysee terspassyd in asmoche as he
demyd and repreuyd in his heart the publican which was iustyfyed of god / And
also he trespassyd for he thankyd god oonly with his mouth / but he delyted
preuely and wylfully by a preuy pride in himself of ye yeftes of god. stelyng
ye worship and loving of god. and set it in himself / This same condycyon of
this pharysee sothely has heretykes and ypocrytes / They will not gladly pray
and if they pray: they meke not hemselfe knowlegyng truly her wretchydnes / but
they make hemself by a fenynge for to thank and love god / and spekyth of hy^
with her mouth / but her delight is vain and falls and not i^ god / and yet they
wene not so / they can not love god / For as the wysema^ says / No^ est
specyosalaus in ore peccatoris / It is neither fair ne semely praysynge of god
in the mouth of a sinner wherefore it is profitable to the and to me and to
such other wretches for to leave the condicyon of this pharisee and feyned
loving of god. and follow ye plublican in lownes / asking mercy and
foryeuenes of sins. and grace of ghostly virtues / yt we might afterward
with a clean heart sothfastly thank him and love him / and give him holy the
worship without feynynge / For our lord askith this by his prophet / Super
quem requiescet sp^s meus. Isay. ^^.
nisi super hu^^le^ contritu^ sp^a and trementu^ sermones meos / Upon whom shall
my spirit rest / and he answers himself and says. upon none but upon ye
meke poor and co^tryte in heart and dredynge my words / Then if thou have the
spyryte of god rulynge in thy heart: have mekenes and dread him /

What things me^ owe to believe by a seker faith / Caplm xxi.
THe ii. thing which the behouith for to have is seker troth in all
chartycles of the faith and in ye sacramentis of holy church / trowynge hem
steadfastly with all thy will in thy heart / and though thou feel any styryng in
thy heart against any of hem by suggestion of thyn enmye for to put the in dowte
of hem be thou steadfast and not to much adrad of feeling of such styrynges
but ^orsake thyn own wit without disputyng or ran sakynge of hem / and set
thy faith generally in the faith of holy church / and charge not the styrynge
of thy heart / Which as the semyth is contrary thereto / For that styrynge is
not thy faith / but the faith of holy church is thy faith / though thou never
see it ne feel it / And bear then such styrynges pacyently as a scourge of our
lord / by the which he will cleanse thy heart and make thy faith steadfast / Also
the behooves to love and worship in thy heart all the laws and ordinance made
by prelates and rulers of holy church other in declarynge of the faith or of
the sacraments or in general of al christian men / mekely and truly assent to
hem / though it be so that thou know not the cause of her ordinance / And
though the think that some were vnskylful / thou shall not deem hem ne
repreue hem / but worship hem all though they long but lytyl to the / Ne
receive thou non opinyon ne fa^tasye ne synguler conceyte under color of more
holiness as some done yt are not wise / another by thyn own ymaginynge. ne by
techynge of none other man: Which contraryeth to the the lest ordinance or
general techyng of al holy church. And over this thou shall hope steadfastly yt
thou art ordened of our lord to be saved. as one of his chosen by his mercy /
and styre not fro this hope what so thou heryst or see / or what te^ptacio^
thou be in / And though thou think so y^ great a wretch yt thou were worthy
to sink in to hell for that thou do no good / ne seruest god as thou
sholdest do / yet hold the in this troth and in this hope / and ask mercy.
and al shall be right well / ye and though al ye deuylles of hell apered in
bodily lyknes slepynge or wakyng saying to ye that thou sholdest not be saved
/ or al men living in earth / or all the angels in heaven / If it might be said
to the the same / thou sholdest not leave hem. ne be styred much fro the hope
of saluacyo^. This I say to the / for some be^ so weyke and so simple yt when
they have yeuen hemself al holy to serve god after her cun^ynge if they feel
any styrynge within by thyn casting of the^mye / or else fro without of any
of the deuylles prophetis which me^ callen soth sayers that they should not be
saved / or her state of her manner of living were not p^esaunt to god / they
ben astonyed and styred with such words / and so for vnc^nynge they fall
sometime in a great h^uynes / and as it werein a dyspayr of salvation / wherefore
as me think it is spedfull to every creature which by our lord Ihesu christ
is in full will to forsake sin / and as clerly as his conscience tellyth him he
suffers no dedely sin rest in him yt he ne shriueth him sone thereof. and
make him to ye sacraments of holy church / for to have a trust of salvation /
And much more than they that yeue^ hem holy to god. and fleen venyal sins
after her might / And on the contrary wise as peryllous it is to him which
lies wyttyngly in dedely sin for to have trust of salvation / and i^ hope
of ye trust will not forsake his syn^e ne low him truly to god and holy church.

How a stable intent is nedeful to these yt should plese god / and dyscrecyon
in bodily works. Ca xxii
THe iii. thing which is nedeful to the for to have in thy beginning. is an
hole and a stable entencyon. that is for to say / A hole will and a desire
only for to plese god / for that is charity / without which all is naught
that thou do And thon shall set thin intent always for to search and traueyle
how thou might plese him. no time for to cesse wylfully of good ocupacyon
other bodily or ghostly / Ne thou shall not set a time in thy heart. as thus
long thou would serve god. and sythen to suffer thyn heart wylfully fall
down in to vain thoughts and idle ocupacions / wenynge that it were nedful
for saving of thy bodily kind: leuynge ye keeping of thy heart and good
ocupacyon. seeking a rest and comfort for a time outward by thy bodily wits.
or inwardly vanytees. as it were for recreacyo^ of thy spyryte \ for it should
be more sharper afterward to ghostly traueyle. for I trow it is not soth / I
say not that thou may in deed perform thyn intent. for often sythes thy bodily
need. e^ynge drinking slepyng and spekyng and ye fraylte of ye flesh shall
let the be thou never so besye / and hinder the / But I would that thy will and

idle / but always lyftynge up thy heart by desire to god and to ye bliss of
heaven whether thou ete or drink or any other bodily traueyle that thou use:
asmoche as thou may wylfully leave it not. For if thou have this intent it shall
make the ever quick and sharpei^ thy travail / and if thou fall by fraylte or
neclygence in any idle ocupacyon or vaynspeche it shall smy^e upon thy heart
sharply as a prycke and make yt for to yrke and be weary of al vanytees / and
for to torn aye^ hastly to inward thynkyng of Ihu^ christ. or to some good

etynge drinking and slepynge. and in all manner bodily penance. and in long
prayer by speech or in bodily feeling by great fervor of devotion other in
weeping or such other / and also in ymagynyng of the spyryte when a man felyth
no grace / In all these works it is good to keep discrecyon / for the mean is
ye best But in des^ruynge of syn^e by keeping of thyn her^: and in co^tynue*
desire of virtues. and ye bliss of heaven / and for to have the ghostly
knowing and the loving of Ihu^ christ hold thou no mean / For the more that
it is of this the bettter it is / For thou shall have syn^e and al flesshly
loves and dredes in thyn heart without seeing / And thou shall love virtues and
clen^es: and desire hem without stintynge if thou might. I say not that it is
nedful to saluacyo^ / but I hope it is spedful. and if thou keep it thou shall
profit more in one year in virtues tha^ thou shall without this profit in
vi^. years /

that should be offered to god / Caplm xxiii
NOw I have told the first of end which thou shall behold in thy desire /
and draw toward it as nygh as thou may / Also I have said the of the
beginning what ye needs for to have / as mekenes siker troth / and an hole
intent to god / upon ye which ground thou shall set thy ghostly house by
prayer and by medytacyon and other ghostly virtues / Then^e say. I to the thus

bad by thyn own freilte / or what yt thou felyst see or herest: smellest or
sauerest without forth in thy bodyly wits / or within in ymagynacyon knowing
or felyng in thy reason / bring it al within ye troth and the rules of holy
church / and cast all in the mortar of mekenes / and break it small with a
pestel of dread of god and torugh the powder of all this in the fire of desire.
and offer it so to god / and I tell ye forsooth well shall that offringe like in
the sight of thy lord Ihu^ / and sweet shall the smoke of that fire smelle to
the face of thy lord Ihesu / This is for to say / Draw all this that thou
felyst within the truth of holy church. and break thyself in mekenes / And
offer the desire of thyn heart oonly to thy lord Ihu^ for to have him and
naught else but him / And if thou do thus / I hope by the grace of christ thou
shall never be overcome by thyn enmye / This taught us saint poul when he said
thus \ Sieve ma^ducatis sieve bibitis. i: little io.

shall most use as I have before said arne prayer and medytacyon First I shall
show the alytyl of prayer and after of medytacyon.

Of prayer that is spedeful to get clennes of heart and virtues / Caplm^ xxiiii
PRayer is profit and spedfull to use for to get cle^nes of heart by
destroyenge of sin and receyuynge of virtues / not that thou sholdest by thy
prayer make our lord know what thou desyrest For he knows well enough what
the needs / but for to make the able and ready by thy prayer that thou might
receive as a clean vessel. the grace yt our lord will freely give to the /
Which grace may not be felt till thou be assayd and puryfyed by ye fire of
desire in devout prayer. For though it be so that prayer is not the cause for
which our lord yeueth grace nevertheless it is a way by the which grace freely
yeuen comyth to a soul /

How men should pray / and whereon the point of her thought shall be set in
prayer / Caplm^ xxv
BUt now desyrest thou peraue^ture for to know how thou sholdest pray / And
upon what thing thou should set the point of thy thought in thy prayer / And
also what prayer were best for ye for to use / As to the first I answer and
say thus / That when thou art wakenyd of thy sleep / and ready for to pray.
thou shalt feel thyself flesshly and heavy ever dou^warde to vain thoughtis.
other of dremes or fa^tasyes or of vnskylful besynes of the world or of thy
flesh / Then behooves the for to quycken thyn heart by prayer / and styre it
as much as thou may to some devotion / And in thy prayer that thou set not
thyn heart in any bodily thing / but al thy traueyle shall be for to draw in
thought fro beholdynge of al bodily thing / that thy desire might be as it
were nakyd and bare fro al erthly things / ever upward styenge unto Ihesu
christ. Whom thou may never see bydely as he is in his godhede. ne by bodily
lyknes in ymaginacyon / But thou may chrugh devout and contynuel beholdynge of
the mekenes of his precious manhede feel the goodness of the grace of his
godhede: When thy desire is eased and helped and as it were made free fro al
flesshly thoughtis and affecco^ns and is much lift up by ghostly might in to
ghostly savor and delight i^ hy^ of his ghostly presence. and hold therein
much of ye time of thy prayer so yt thou have no great mind of erthly thing
/ or else ye mind greueth ye but lityl / if thou ca^ pray thus / tha^ can
thou pray well For prayer is naught else but a styenge desire of the heart in to
god: by withdrawynge of the heart fro al erthly thoughts / And so is prayer
lykned to a fire / which of his own kind leueth the lowenes of the earth /
and always styeth up into thayer. Right so desire in prayer when it is to wchyd

Of the fire of love / Caplm: xxvi
AL men y^ speken of the fire of love known not well what it is / for what it
is I can not tell the save this I may tell the: that it is neither bodily. ne
bodily felyd / A soul may feel it in prayer or in devotion Which soul is in
the body / but he felyth it not with no bodily wit / For though it be so that
it work in a soul. the body may torn in to an hete / and as it were chaffed
for liking travail of the spyrite / Netheles the fire of love is not bodily.
for it is only in the ghostly desire of the soul. This is no dowte to no man
or woman that felyth devotion / But some ben simple and wene by cause it is
called fire that it should be hot as bodily fire is and for thy I say that I
have said

That the certain prayer in speech ordened of god and of holy church is best to
he^ y^ be^ new turned to god and to deuocyo^ / Ca xxvii
NOw as for the other for to know what prayer were best for to use / I shall
say as me think Thou shall understand yt there ben iii. manner of prayers. The
first is prayer of speech made specially of god as is the pater noster: and
made also more generally by thordynaunce of holy church as matyns euensonge
and hours. And also made by devout men of other specyal sayenges as to our
lord and to our lady / and to his saints / As to this manner of prayer which
is called vocal me thinks unto the that art relygyous and by custom and rule
art bound for to say mateyns and hours I hold it most spedeful for to say
hem as devoutly as thou may. For when thou say thy mateyns / thou say
also thy pater noster pryncypally and other more / For to styre the to more
devotion was it ordened for to say also psalms and ympnes and such other
which be^ made by the holy ghost as the pater noster is / And therefore thou
shall not say hem hastily and rechelesly as thou were evil apayd that thou art
bound with hem / but thou shall gader thyn affection and thy thought for to
say hem sadly and more devoutly than any othrer special prayer of devotion.
trowynge forsothe that sith it is the prayer of holy church / there is no
prayer so profitable to the which is vocal for to use comynly as that is. And
so shall thou put away al heuanes / and by grace thou shall turn thy need in
to a good will: and thy bond in to a great fredom. yt it shall no lettynge be
to the of ghostly ocupacyo^ And after this thou may if thou will use other. as
thy pater noster. or any such other. and of thise in the which thou felest
most savor and most ghostly co^ for in / yt hold I best to the. this manner of
prayer is spedfull comynly to every man in the beginning of his conuersyon for
to use most of any other ghostely ocupacyon \ For a man in the beginning is
rude and boystous and flesshly but if he have the grace / and can not think
no ghostly thoughts in meditacyon. for his soul is not yet cleansed fro the
old syn^e / and therefore I hope it is most spedful for to use this manner of
prayer. as for to say his pater noster and his aue: and to read upon his sawter
/ and such other For he yt can not run lightly by ghostly prayer. for his
fete of knowing and of loving ben seek for sin. him nedethe to have a syker
staff for to hold him by / This staff is specyal prayer of speech ordened by
god and holy church in help of mennys souls. By the which prayer the soul
of a flesshly man that is always falling dounwarde in to worldly thoughts and
flesshly affeccyons shall be lift up fro hem and be holden by it as by a
staff, fed with shete words of the prayer as a child with milk / and ruled
by it that he fall not in to errors ne fantasyes by his vain meditacyons /
For in this manner of prayer is no deceyte who so will steadfastly and mekely
travail therein /

What peril is to men yt in ye begyn^yng of her torninge to god leueth the
common prayer of thordynaunce of of ^oly church / and yeue^ hem to medytacyo^.
Ca xxviii
THen may thou see by this that thise men if any be such yt in the beginning
of her conuersyo^ or soon after wha^ they have felt a lytyl ghostly comfort
other in devotion or in knowing and are not yet stabled therein: they leave such
prayer vocal to sone and other bodily exercise / and give them holy to
mydytacion they be^ not wise / for oftsythes in her rest for her meditacyons
they ymagyn and think on ghostly things after her own wit and follow her
bodily feeling / and have not yet received grace thereto. and therefore they by
descrecyon oftesythes ouertrauayle her wits. and breken her bodily might. and
so they fall in to fantatasyes and syngler conceytes or in opyn errors: and
letten ye grace that god yeuyth he^ by such vanitees: the cause of all this is
a preuy pride of hemself. as wha^ they have felt a lytyl grace they wene it so
much passing other yt they fall in vaynglory and so they lose it / If they
wist how lytyl it were yt they feel i^ regard of that ye godyeuith or may give.
they should be ashamyd to speak ought thereof but it were in great need / Of
this manner of prayer by speech. shekyth dauyd in the ^awter thus / Uoce mea ad
dn^m clamaui. P. xiiii
voce mea ad dn^m dep^catus sum. Loo david ye prophe^e for to styre other men
to pray both with heart and with mouth said / with thy voys I cried to god. and
with my speech I besought our lord /

Of the ii. manner of prayer yt is in speech not certain but folowyth ye styryng
of deuocyo^. Caplm xxix
THe ii. manner of prayer is by speech / but it is not of any certain specyal al
saying / And this is wha^ a man or a woman felyth grace of devotion by the ye^t
of god. and in his devotion spekith to him as he were bodily in his presence
with such words as acordeth most to his styryng for the time. and as comyth
to his mind after diverse rewards which he felyth in his heart / either
rehersyng his sins and his wretchydnes. or the malice and the sleyghtes of
the enmye / or else the mercy and the goodness of god / And with that he cries
with desire of heart and with speech of mouth to our lord for socour and for
help. as a man that were in peril among his enmyes. or in syknes showing his
^ores to god as to a leche / saying as david said: P. c. iz. con P. xl
Eripe me de inimicis me is deus meus / A lord deliver me of mine enmyes / Or
else thus / Sana ai^am mea^ qr peccaue tibi / A lord hele my soul. for I
have sinned against ye / Or such other as comes to mind / And also him
thinks so much godenes and grace and mercy in god yt him lykith with great
affection of ye heart for to love him and thank him by such words and psalms
as acordeth to ye loving and praysynge of god..P.
as dauyd said. Co^fitemini dn^o qm^ bonus qm^ in sclm mi^a eius. Love ye and
praise our lord. for he is good. and by such other as he is styred to say.

That ye ii. manner of paryer pleseth much god. and makyth a man to have hy^ in
body as he were dronke. and makyth him in soul to be wounded with the sword
of love / Caplm xxx
THis manner of prayer much pleseth god. for it is oonly of ye affeccyo^ of ye
heart / and therefore it goth never vnsped without some grace / this prayer
lo^geth to the ii. part of conte^placyon as I have said before Who so has this
yeft of god reuere^tly / him behouith for the time to flee presence and company
of all men: and to be alone yt he be not let / who so have it hold it while
he may / for it may not long last in the fervor. For if grace come
plenteuously. it is traueylous wonderfully to ye spyrite: though it be likyng /
And it is much wastyng to ye bodily kind who so much use it / For it makyth
the body if grace come myghtly for to styre and turn here and there as a man
yt were mad or dro^ken and cowde have no rest / this is a point of ye passion
of love. y^ which by great vyole^ce and maystry brekyth down al lusts and
lykynges of any erthly thing / and it wou^deth ye soul with ye blysful sword
of love. yt the body falls down and may not bear it This touching is of so
great might yt the most vycyous or flesshly man living in earth: if he were
well towched ones myghtely with this sharp sword / he should be right sad
and sobre a great while after: and loathe al y^ lusts and lykynges of his
flesh: and al erly things which he had most delight in /

How ye fire of love wastes al flesshli lusts. as other fire wastyth hodely
things / Caplm xxxi
OF this manner of feeling spekith the prophet Ieremye thus / Et factus est in
cord meo quasi ignis estuans clausus qm in ossibus meis. Tren^.
and defeci far no^ sustinens / This is thus much to understood: The love
and the felyng of god was made in my heart not fire / but as fire glowyng / For
as bodily fire bre^neth and wastes al bodily thing where it comyth / Right so
ghostly fire / as is yt love of god brenneth and wastes al flesshly loves and
lykynges in a man's soul / And this fire is stokyn in my bones / as the
prophet says of himself. That is for to say / This love fulfyllyth ye
myghtes of my soul. as mind reason and will of grace and ghostly swetnes / as
marow fyllyth full ye bone / and yt within. and not wihout in the wits.
Nevertheless it is so mighty within yt it smyteth out in to the body and makyth
all the body quake and tremyse. It is so fer fro the bodily kind and so
uncouth yt he can no skyll on it. and may not bear it / but falls and falls
down as the prophet says / And therefore our lord temperith it. and
withdraws the fervor: and suffers the heart to fall in to a sobyrte of more
softnes / who can pray thus often. he spedeth soon in his traueyle / He shall
get more of virtues i^ a lytyl time tha^ some man without this or a another as
good shall get in long time. for all the bodily penance yt he might do \ And
who has this. it needs not for to charge ye bodily kind with more penance
tha^ it berith / if he have it often

Of the third manner of prayer that is only i^ ye heart without speech
outward / Caplm xxxii
THe iii. manner of prayer is only in the heart without speech by greece rest
and softnes of ye bodi and of the soul / A clean heart him behooves to have
that shall pray well thus. For it is of such men and wym^en that by long
traueylle bodily and ghostly / or else by such sharp smytynges of love as I
have before said comen into rest of speryte / so that her affeccyo^ is turned
in to ghostly savor / that they mowenygh contynuelly pray in her heart / and
love and praise god withouut great lettyng of temptacyons or of vanytees. as I
have before said in the second part of contemplacyon / Of this manner of prayer
says saint poule thus / Nam si orem lingua: spiritus meus orat. Little xiiii
men's autem mesine fructu est. Quidergo / Orabo et spritu orabo and mente.
psallam spiritu psallam and mente / That is to say / if I pray with my tongue by
the will of spyryte and by traueyle / the prayer is medeful. but my soul is not
fed / For it felyth not the fruit of ghostly swetnesse by understanding What
shall I then do said saint poul / And he answeryth and says / I shall pray by
traueyle and desire of the spyryte / And I shall pray also more inwardly in my
spyryte without travail in ghostly savor and swetnes of the love and ye sight
of god / by the which sight and felyng of love my soul is fed / Thus as I
understand saint poul cowde pray / Of this manner of prayer speaks our lord
in holy writ by figure thus Ignis in altari meo semper ardebit. Leuit. con,
and cotidie sacerdos surgens mane subiciet ligna vt ignis no^ extinguatur /
This is for to say / The tire of love shall ever be light in the soul of a
devout and clean man or woman / the which is the awter of our lord / And
they pressed shall every day at morn lay to styckes and norysshe the fire / That
is to say / This man shall by holy psalms: clean thoughts. and fervent desire
norysshe the fire of love in his heart that it goo no tout in any time / This
test our lord yeuyth to some of his servants as it were a reward of her
travail. and a shadow of the love which they shall have in ye bliss of heaven
/

How men should do that be^ traueyled with vain thoughts i^ her prayers. Ca.
xxxiii
BUt now see thou that I speak over hye to the in this manner of prayer / for
it is no maystry to me for to say it / for it is no mastry to me say that
thou can not pray thus devoutly ne so holy in heart as I speak of For when
thou would have ye mind of thyn heart upward to god in thy prayer. thou
felyst so many thoughts in vain of thyn own deeds before done or what thou
shall do / and of other mene^s deeds / and such many other / lettyng and
taryengne so y^ thou may another feel savor ne rest ne deuocyo^ in thy saying
/ and often sythes the more thou trauaylest to keep thyn heart. the ferder it is
fro the: and the harder: sometime fro the beginning to the last end: that the
think it is but lost all that thou do / And unto this that thou say that
I speak to hye to the of prayer / I grant well that I speak otherwise than I
can or may do / Nevertheless I say it for this intent / that thou sholdeest
know how we ought to pray if we did well / And sythen we may not do so / that
we know then^e our feebleness mekely. and cry god mercy / Our lord bad thus
himself when he said ^Diliges dn^m deu^ tuu^ ex toto cord tuo: Mxxii
ex tota ai^a tua. and exori^bus viribus ^uis / Thou shall love god of al thyn
heart and al thy soul. and all thy might / It is Impossible to any man for to
fulfylle this byddyng so fully as it is said. living in erche / And yet
neuerthekes our lord bad us for to love so for this entenct as saint bernarde
says / that we should know thereby our feebleness / and then mekely cry after
mercy / and we ^hal have it. Nevertheless I shall tell the as me thinks in
this asking / what thou shall pray make thyn intent and thy will in the
beginning as hole and as clean to god as thou may shortly in thy mind / and
then^e begyn^e and do as thou may. And though thou be never somoche let
ayents thy first will. be not adrad. ne to angry with thyself / ne inpacyent
ayents god: that he yeueth the not the savor of ghostly swetnes with devotion
as ye thinks that he yeueth to other creatures / But see thereby thyn own
feebleness: and bear it easily / holdyng in thyn own sight thyn own prayer
feeble as it is with mekeness of heart / trustyng also sykerly in the mercy of
our lord that he shall make it good and profitable the more than thou know
or felest / For wit thou well that thou art excused of thy debt. and thou
shall have mede for it as for an other good deed yt thou do in charity
though thyn heart were not thereupon in the doing / Therefore do that longs to
ye. and suffer our lord to give what he will: and teache him not. And though
thou think thyself recheles and necligent / and as thou were in great defawte
for such things / Nevertheless yet shall thou for this defawte and al other
venyals which may not be eschewed in this wretthyd life lift up thyn heart to
god / knowlegyng thy wretchydnes / and cry mercy with a good trust of
foryeuenes and strive no more therewith: ne hang no longer thereupon as thou
would by mastry not feel such wretchydnes. Leave of and go to some other good
deed bodily or sthostly / and think for to do better a another time / But
though thou fall on a another time in the same ye an hundred times / ye a
thousand times / yet do as I have said: and al shall be well / Ferder more a
soul that never may find rest of heart in prayer / but al her life time is
striuybng with her thoughts and taryeth and trowbleth with hem. if she keep
her mekenes and charity in other sides / she shall have full much mede in heaven
for her good traueyle.

Of medication of synful men afte that they be^ holy turned to god / Caplm^
xxxiiii
NOw of medytacyon shall I tell the a little as me thinks. Thou shall
understand that in meditacyons may not certain rule well be set every man for to
keep / for they are in free yeft of our lord after the diverse dysposinges of
chosen solwles / and after yt state that they ben in / and also after that they
profyten in virtues and in her astate. So he increases her meditacyons both
in ghostly knowing and loving of y^. For who so is every ylike wise in
knowing of god and ghostly things it seems that he wexeth but a lytyl in the
love of god / and that may be showed opynly in tha postles. when they in yt day
of pe^tecost were fulfilled with bren^ing love of ye holy ghost. they were made
neither foles nefoltie / but they were made wonder wise both i^ knowi^g and
spekyng of god and of gostly things / asmoches as man might have in flesh
living Thus spekyth holy wryth of hem / Repleti sunt omnes sp^u sc^o^. et ce
perunt loqui magnalia dei / They were fulfilled of ye holy ghost and they began
to speak yt great merueyles of god / and all that knowing they had by
rauysshenge in love of the holy ghost / Diverse meditacyons there ben / which
our lord puts in a man's heart: So me shall I tell as me thynkyth for this
entente / If thou feel any of them that thou sholdest ye better traueyle in he^
/ In the beginning of co^uercy on of such a man that has be much foiled with
worldly or flesshly synns / comynly his thought is most upon his sins with
great compunccyon and sorrow of heart / with great weeping and many teres of the
eye / mekely and besely asking mercy and foryenenes of god for hem / And if he
be to wchyd sharply for our lord will make him soon clean / him shall think
that his sins are ever in his sight so foul and so horrible that uneath shall
he mow bear himself / And though he shroue him never so clearly / yet shall he
find fighting and fretynge and bytynge of his concyence that him shall think
that he is not shryuen right. And uneath shall he mow have any rest / in
somoche that he should not endure such traueylene were it that our lord of
his mercy comfort him sometime as he will by great devotion of his passion or
of some other as he will give it. Upon this manner werketh our lord in some
men's hertes more or less as he will / And all this is the great mercy of
our lord that not oonly will foryeue the sin or the trespase / but he will
both forgive the trespase and ye pain for it in purgatory for such a lytyl
pain here of bytynge of conscience / And also if he will dyspose a man to
receive any specyal yeft of the love of god / him behouyth first to be scowred
and cleansed by such a fire of conpunccion for all the great sins before done
/ Of this manner traueylle speaks david in many places of the sawter / and
specially in the psalm / Pli:
Miserere mei deus /

That ye meditation of ye ma^hede of christ or of his passion is yeuen freely of
the holy ghost / And how it shall be known when it is yeuen / Caplm^ xxxv
ANd then sometime after this traueyle. and sometime with al. such a man or
else a another the which by grace of god has be kept in Innocence / our lord
yeuith a meditacyon of his ma^hede / as of his birth or of his passion. and of
the compassyon of our lady saint mary / when this medytacyon is made by the
holy ghost / then it is right profitable and gracyous. And that thou shall
wit by this token / When it is so that thou art styred to a meditadyon in god
/ and thy thought is suddenly drawn out fro all worldly and flesshly things
and the thinks as thou see in thy soul thy lord Ihesu in a bodily lyknes
as he was in earth / and how he was taken of the Jews and bounden as a theyf
beten and dispysed / scourged and demyd to death / How lowely he bare ye cross
upon his back and how cruelly he was veyled thereupon / Also of the crown of
thorns upon his head / and of the sharp spear that stycked him to the heart /
and thou in this ghostly sight felyst thin heart styred to so great compassyon
and pity of thy lord Ihesu that thou mornest and wepest and criest with all the
myghtes of thy body and of thy soul / wonderynge the goodness and the love. the
pacyence and the mkenes of our lord Ihesu / that he would for so synful a
caytyf as thou art suffer so much pain / And nevertheless thou felyst somoche
goodness and mercy in our lord that thyn heart rises up in to a love and a
gladness of him with many sweet teres: having great trust of foryeues of the
sins and of salvation of thy soul by the virtue of this precious passion /
that when ye mind of crystes passion or any point of his manhede is thus made
in thyn heart by such a ghostly sight / with devout affeccyo^ answeryng thereto
/ wit thou well then that it is not of thyn own werkyng. ne feynyng of no
wicked spyryte / but by the grace of the holy ghost For it is an openy^ge of
the ghostly eye in to crystis manhede. Bern^.
And it may be called the flesshly love of god / as saint bernarde callyth it /
In as much as it is set in the flesshly kind of christ / And it is right
good and a great help in destroyenge of great sins / and a good way to come
to virtues / and so after to contemplacion of the godhede / For a man shall not
come to ghostly light in contemplacyon of crystes godhede / but if he come
first in ymagycyon by bytternes and by compassyon / and by steadfast thynkyng of
his ma^hede / Thus saint poul did. First he said thus / Nichil indicaui me
scire inter vos. p^. little..con.
nisi Ihm^ xp^m and hunt crucifixum / I showed you right naught that I couth.
but Ihesu christ. and him crucyfyed / As if he had said \ My knowing and my
trust is oonly in the passion of christ / And therefore said he thus also. Gal.
con
Micht aute^ absit gloriari nisi in cruce dn^i nostri thu^ crysti / Forboden be
fro me al manner of Joy and liking but in the cross and in the passion of
our lord Ihesu christ / p^ little i
And nevertheless afterward he said thus / Predicamus vobis xp^m dei vircutem
et dei sapiencia^ / As who says / First I preched of the manhede and the
passion of christ / Now I preche to you of ye godhede / As thus That christ is
the might of god / and the endless wisdom of god /

That the medytacyon of the passion of christ is with drawn fro hem that it is
yeuen to often sythes for dyues causes / Caplm xxxvi
THis manner of medytacyon a man has not always when he would / but when our
lord will give it / Unto some men and wymmen he yeuyth it all their life time
by sythes when he vysyteth hem / As so me men arne so tender in her affection
that when they here men speak / or else that they thynken of his precious
passion. her hertes melten in devotion / And arne fed and comforted against
all manner temptacyons of the enmye / And y^ is a great yeft of god / To some
me^ he yeueth it first ple^teuously / and afterward he withdraws it for
diverse causes. Other if a man wexe proud of it in his own syghte / or for
some other sin / by the which he makyth himself unable for to receive y^
grace / Or else our lord withdrawith it / and al other deuocyons sometime fro
a man or a woman / for he will suffer him to be assayd by temptacyons of his
enmye / And so will he dyspose a man for to know and feel himself more ghostly
/ For he said so himself to his dyscyples / Expedit vobis vt ego vadam / Si
enim non abiero: Ioh. icon
peraclitus non venit ad vos / It is spedeful to you that I go fro you bodily /
for if I goo not the holy ghost may not come to you. For as long as he was
with hem they loved him much / but it was flesshly in his manhede / And
therefore it was spedeful to hem that he should withdraw the bodily form fro
her sight / yt the holy ghost might come to hem / and teache hem for to love him
and know him more ghostly / as he did on ye day of pentecost. Right so it is
spedful to some that our lord withdraw a lytyl the bodily and the flesshly
lyknes fro the eye of ye soul yt the heart might be set and fyxed more
besyly in ghostly desire / and seeking of his godhede

Of diverse temptacyons of the fend. Caplm xxxvii
Nevertheless it behouyth a man to suffer many temptacyons first / And these
temptacyons fallen oftsythes to some men and wymmen after when comfort is
withdrawn / upon diverse manners by malice of the enmye / As thus / when the
devil perceyuethe devotion much withdrawn. that the soul is left as it were
nakyd for a time / then sends he to some men temptacyons of lechery of
glotenye. so hot and so bren^ynge / that hem shall think that they felyd
never none so grievous in all her life time before when they yaaf hem most to
sin. In so much that they shall think it impassyble for to stand long and
suffer that they ne shall needs fall but they have help / and therefore have
they then much sorrow / both for lackyng of comfort and devotion which
they were wont to have / And they have much dread of falling fro god by such
open sins / And all this werketh the devil at the suffraunce of god for to
done hem forthynke her good purpoos and turn again to sin as they were wont
to do / But who so will abide a while and suffer a lytyl pain / and not turn
ayene to sin for no thing the hand of our lord is full nere / and helpyth
right soon. For he kepyth him full sykerly / and the man wot not how as the
prophet david says in the person of our lord. Cum ip^o sum in tribulacyone.
P. con0.
eripiam cu^ and glorificabo eum / I am with him in his tribulacyon / and in
temptacyon I shall deliver him / and I shall make him glorious in my bliss /
Some men he tempts by ghostly sins malycyously. as by mystro wynge of the
faith or of the sacrament of our lords blessed body / Also of despeyre or of
blasphemye in our lord or any of his saints / or lothynge of her life / or
bytternes or vnskylful heaviness / or of to much dread of himself and of her
body if they put he^ holy to goddis seruyse / Some men he tompteth also. and
namly solytory men and wymmen by dredes and vglynes. and quakynges and
shakynges / either apperyng to hem i^ bodily lyknes or else in ymaginyng
slepynge and wakyng / And taryeth hem so that uneath may they have any rest /
And also on many other wyses he tempts. mo than I can or may say /

Of diverse remedies against temptacyons of the fend / Caplm xxxviii.
Remedy to such men and wymmen y^ arne thus traueyled. or any otherwise. may
be this / First that they will put al her trust in our lord Ihu^ christ / and
bring to mind often his passion: and ye pains y^ he suffered for us / and
that they then^e trow steadfastly that al sorrows and traueyle that they suffer
in such temptacyons / which to an vncunnyng man semyth a forsakynge / of god
/ That it is no repreuynge ne no forsakynge / but assayenge for her better /
Either for clensyng of her sins before done / or for great encreasynge of her
mede and disposyng to much grace / if they will suffer a while / and stand
fast that they torn not ayene wylfully to sin / Another remedy is. that
they dread not ne charge not as for a sin. ne set not at heart such
malycyous styrynges of dyspeyre or of blasphemye or of the sacrament. or any
such other that were ugly for to here / For the feeling of these temptacyons
fyleth the soul no more than if they herd an hounde berke. or a flee byte /
They taryen the soul / but they apeyre not the soul if a man wyldyspyse hem.
and set hem at naught / For it is not good for to strive with hem for to put
hem out by maystry / For ye more that they strive with such thoughts. the
more they cleue to hem / And therefore they shallen as much as they may draw
out the thought fro hem / and set it to some other ocupacyo^ / And yet if
they will ever hang upon hem / then it is good to hem that they be not angri ne
heavy to feel hem / but wih a good trust in god bear hem as it were a bodily
pain and a scourge of our lord for clensynge of her sins. as long as he
will for his love / as he was scourged and bare the cross for her love / And
over this it is good to hem for to show her hertes to some wise man in the
beginning before they ben roted in the here / and that they leave her own wit
and follow the counseyle of him / And that they show hem not lightly to none
vncunnyng or worldly man which never felt such te^ptacyons / For they might
lightly bring a simple soul in to dispeyre by vncu^nynge of hemself / Of
these manner of temptacyons by the which a man semyth forsaken of god and is
not In comfort of hem that arne tempted our lord says thus by his prophet /
In modico dereliquite. Isa liiii
and in momento indignacionis me percussite / et in miseracionibus meis multos
congregabote / In a lytyl I forlefte the. That is to say. I suffer the for to
be tarried a lytyl And in a point of my wrath I smote the that is to say / All the penance and the pain y^ thou suffrest here is but a point of my wrath in
regard of the pain of hell or of purgatory And yet in my many fold mercyes
I shall gader together the / when the thinks that thou art forsaken. Job xi.
then shall I of my great mercy gader the again to me / For wha^ thou wenyst that
thou art as it were lost then shall our lord help the as Job says / Cu^te
consumptu^ putaueris: orieris vt lucifer et habebis fiducia^ That is to say.
when thou art brought so low by traueyle in temptacion that the thinks none
help ne no comfort. but as thou were a forloor man / yet stand stefly in
hope and pray god. and sothly thou shall suddenly spring up as the day sterre
in gladness of heart. and have a very trust in god as Job says /

How that god hem that he choseth he suffrth to be tarried and tempted and after
ward comfort hem and stableth hem in grace / Caplm xxxix.
ANd also in comfort of such men yt they should not dyspeyre in temptacyo^. Eec

the wise man says thus of our lord / In temptaco^ne ambular cu^ eo / In
primis elegit eum timorem and metum and approbacionem inducit super illu^. et
cruciabit illu^ in tribulacione doctrine sue donec temptet illu^ in
cogitacionibus suis. et credet anime illius. ad iter directu^ adducet illum. et
firmabit illu^ and letificabit illu^ / et denudabit absconditasua illi. et the
zaurisabit super illu^ sciencia^ and intellectu^ iusticie / This is thus much
for to say / This wise man for he would that no man should dispeyre in
temptacyon. in comfort of hem says thus / In temptacyo^ our lord for saketh
not a man. but he gooth with him fro the beginning in to the last end / For
he says / first he chesyth him / And that is when he drawyth a man to him by
comfort of devotion / And afterward sorrow and dread and assayenge he brings
upon him. And that is. when he withdraws devotion and suffers him to be
tempted / And he says that he turmenteth him in tribulacyon until he have well
assayd him in his thoughts / And until a man will put al his trust in him
fulli. And then after this our lord brings him out in to the right way /
and festenyth him to him and gladdeth him / and sythen she with him his
pryuytees / and yeuith him his tresour of knowing and understanding of right
wysnes / By these words of holy wryt may thou see ye these temptacyons or any
other be they never so ugly to a man y^ by grace is in full will to forsake
sin arne spedeful and profitable if he will suffer as he may and abide goddis
will. and not turn again to syn^e which he has forsaken for no sorrow ne pain
ne dread o^ such te^ptacyons / but ever stand still in traueyl and in prayer
with good hope / Our lord of his endless goodness having pity and mercy of al his
creatures wha^ he sees time he lays to his ho^de and smyteth down the devil
and al his power and eases hem of her traueyle / And puts a way al dredes
and sorrows and derkenes out of her hertes / and brings i^ to her souls
light of grace / and openyth ye sight of the soul for to see that all the
traueyle that they had it was spedeful to hem / yeuynge to hem also a new
ghostly might to ayenstonde all the fondynges of the fend / and al dedely
sins without great traueyle / and ledeth hem in to a sadness of good virtues
living / In the which if they ben meke he keeps hem unto her last end. and
then he takes hem al holy to him / This thing I say to the if thou be tarried
or traueyled with any such manner of temptacyons / be not tomoche adrad / but
do as I have said and better if thou may / And I hope by the grace of our
lord Ihesu christ thou shalt never be over come by thine enmye.

That a man should not give him to ydlenes ne lightly leave the grace yt is
yeuen him of god. Caplm^ xl
AFter this when thou art escaped such temptacyons or else our lord has so
kept ye as he does many by his mercy that thou have not be tarried much with
none such / Then it is good to the yt thou turn not thy rest in to
ydylnesse For there is many a man y^ takyth rest upon him to sone. But thou
shall if thou will begin a new game and a new traueyle / And yt is for to
enter within in to thyn own soul by medytacion for to know what it is / And
by the knowing thereof to come to the ghostly knowing of god / For saint
austyn says / Aug.
By the knowing of myself I shall hete ye knowing of god / I say not that it is
nedful to ye and debt for to traueyle so ne to none other man / but he feel
him styred by grace as he were called thereto / For our lord gives diverse
gifts where so he will / not to one man al / ne to al men one / saaf charity
which is common to al men / and therefore if a man or a woman have received a
yefte of god. as devotion in prayer / or in the passion of christ / Or any
other be it never so lytyl / leave it not to sone for none other / but if he
feel sothfastly a better / But hold that he has and traueyle therein stably /
ever desyryng a better when god will give it / Nevertheless if that be withdrawn
somewhat and he sees a better / And felith his heart styred thereto. Then semith
it a calling of our lord to the better / And then it is time that he follow
after for to get it. And fulfylle it as swyftly as he may /

That a man should know the mesure of his gift that he may desire and take a
better when god will give it / Caplm^ xli
OUr holy faders here before taughten us that we should know the mesure of our
gift / And upon that work not taking upon us by feynyng more than we have in
feeling / We mow ever desire the best. but we mow not ever work the best. for
we yet have not received that grace / An hou^de that ren^eth after ye haar
oonly for he sees other hounds run when he is weary he rests him or
tourneth him home aye^ But if he run for he sees ye haar. he will not space
for werynes till he have gotten it. Right so it is ghostly. who so has grace be
it never so little. and leuyth wylfully the werkynge thereof. and makyth himself
to traueyle in a another which he has not yet. oonly for he sees or hereth
that other men did so. sothly he may run a while till he be weary. And then
shall he turn home again. And but he be ware. he may hurt his fete by some
fantasyes or that he come home But he that werketh in such grace as he has.
And desires by prayer mekely and lastyngly after more. And after felyth his
heart styred for to follow the grace which he desired. he may sykerly ren if
he keep mekenes / And therefore desire of god as much as thou may / without
mesure of dyscrecyon of all that longs to his love or to heaven bliss / For
who so can most desire of god / most shall feel of him / But werkyth as thou
may: and cry god mercy for yt thou may not / Thus it semyth saint poul
said / Unusquisque habet domum suum a deo. p^ little. vii.
Alius autem sic: alius vero sic / ephesians. iiii
Itm^ / Unicutque nostrum data est gracia scdm mensuram donacionis cristi Itm^
Diuisiones gra^rum sunt. p^. little. ir.
Alii datursermo sapiencie. alii sermo sciencie. etc / Itm^ / Ut sciamus que a
deo donata sunt nobis / Saint poul faith that every man has his yeft of god /
one thus. and another thus / For to every man that shall be saved is yeuen a
grace after the mesure of crystes yeft / And therefore it is spedeful that we
know the yeftes which arne yeuen us of god that we might work in he^ / for
by those we shall be saved as some by bodily works: and by deeds of mercy /
some by great bodily penance / some by sorrow and weeping for her sins al her
life time / some by prechynge and techynge / some by diverse graces and yeftes
of devotion shall be saaf and come to bliss /

That a man should traueyle to know his own soul and the myghtes thereof /
and break down the ground of sin therein / Caplm xlii
Nevertheless there is one work which is nedeful and spedeful to traueyle in /
And I hope an high plain way as much as may be in man's work to
contemplacyon / And yt is a man for to enter in to himself for to know his
own soul / and the myghtes thereof / The fayrnes and the foulnes of it / In
this inward beholdynge thou shall mow see the worship and the dygnyte which
it should have by kind of the first making / and thou shall see the
wretchydnes and the myscheyf which thou art fall in for sin And of this
sight shall come a desire with great longyng in thyn heart for to recover again
y^ dygnyte and worship which thou have lost / Also thou shall feel a lothynge
and a grysyng of thyself with a great will for to destroy and bear down thy
self and al things that letten the fro that dygnyte and that Joy / This is a
ghostly traueyle hard and sharp in the beginning who so will quyckely
traueyle there in / For it is a traueyle in the soul ayenste the ground of al
sins lytyl and much. which ground is naught else but a falls mysruled love
of man to himself / Out of this love as saint austen says spryngeth all manner
of sin dedely and venyal. And sothly until this ground be well ransaken and
deep doluyn / and as it were nere dried up by outcastyng of al flesshly and
worldly dredes and loves / a soul may never feel ghostly the brennynge love
of Ihesu christ / ne have the homlynes of his gracyous presence / ne have clear
sight of ghostly things by light of understanding / This is the traueyle that
a man behooves to draw his heart and his mind fro the flesshly love and the
liking of al erthly creatures / fro vain thoughts and fro flesshly
ymagynacyons. And out fro the love and the vycyous feeling of himself / that
the soul shall mow no rest find in no flesshly thoughts / ne erthly
affection / Then in as much as the soul may not find his gholy rest in
the love and in the sight of Ihesu Christ / it behouyth nedelynges to sustre
pain / This traueylle is somdelyche strayte and narowe / And nevertheless I
hope it is the way which christ teched to he^ y^ would he his perfy^e lovers in
ye gospel saying thus / Conte^d^ie i^trare per angusta^ porta^ / qm^ a^^a est
via que ducit ad vita^. Luc. xiii.
et pauci inueniunt ea^ / Strive ye for to enter by a strayte yate / for the
way yt ledeth to heaven is narow. and few men fyndeth it / And how streyte
this way is our lord tells in a another place thus / Si quis vult venire
post me abneget semetip^m and tolat cruce^sua^ and sequa^ me / Itm^. M. xvi
Qui odit ai^am sua^ in hoc mundo / in vitam eternam custoditea^ / That is to
say / who so will come after me / forsake himself and hate his own sou^e. That
is to say / Forsake al flesshly love and hate his own flesshly life / and
vain likyng of al his bodily wits for love of me And take the cross / That
is to say / Suffer y^ pain of this a while / and then follow me / that is
to say. in co^templacyon of my manhede and of my godhede / This is a strayte
way and a narow that no bodily thing may pass thorugh it / for it is a sleeng
of all syn^e as saint poul says Call. iii
/ Mortificate me^bra vestra que sunt super terra^ / immundicia^ libidine^
concupiscencia^ malam / Slay your members upon earth / not the members of the
body but of the soul / as uncleanness lust and vnskylful love of your self and
to erthely things / Therefore as thy traueyle has been here before for to
ayenstonde bodily sins and open temptacions of the enmye as it were fro
without. right so the behouyth now in this ghostly work within thy self for
to destroy and break the ground of syn^e in thyself asmoche as thou may / And
that thou might ye more redyly bring it about / I shall tell the as me
thynkyth /

How a man shall know the wretchydnes and the worship of his soul that it had
first of / And what wretchydnes and myscheyf it is fall in for sin /
Capitulum / xliii
THe soul of a man is a life made of three myghtes mind reason and will. to the
image and the lyknes of the blessed trynyte / In as much as the mind was made
mighty and steadfast by the virtue of the fader almyghtydod. for to hold him
without foryetyng. distractynge or lettyng of any creature / And so it has
lyknes of the fader / The reason was made bright and clear without error or
derknes as perfectly as a soul i^ a body vngloryfyed might have. And so it
has the lyknes of the son / which is endless wysdom / And the love and the
will was made clean brennynge in to god without bestly love of the flesh of
any creature by the souereyne goodness of god and the holy ghost / And so it
has ye lyknes of the holy ghost. which is blessed love / so yt a man's soul
which may be called a made trinyte was fulfilled in mind: sight and love of
ye unmade most blessed trynyte which is our lord: This is the dignyte the
state and the worship of a man's soul by kind of the first making / This
state thou had in adam before the first sin of man. But when adam sinned
chesynge love and delight in himself and in creatures / he lost al his worship
and his dignyte. and thou also in him. and fell fro ye blessed trinyte in to a
foul derke wretchyd trinyte. that is i^ to the foryetynge of god / and
unknowing of him / and in to a bestly liking of himself / And ye skylfully /
For as david layth in the sawter / Homo cu^ in honor esset non intellexit:
Psalmo.
co^peratus est iumentis insipientibes et silis factus est illis / A man when
he was in worship he knew it not / And therefore he lost it and was made like a
best / See now then the wretchydnes of thy soul / For as the mind was sometime
stablyd in god / right so now it has forgoten him / and sekith his rest in
creatures: now from one to an another / and never may find full rest / For he
has lost him in whom is full rest / And right so it is of reason / and the
love also / which was clean in ghostly savor and swetnes / now it is tournyd
into a foul bestly lust and liking in it self / and in creatures / and in
flesshly savors both in the wits as in gloteny and lechery. and in ymagynyng
/ as i^ pride vaynglory and couetise. In somoche that thou may uneaths do
any good deed / but if thou be defoyled with vaynglory Ne thou may not well use
none of thy.v. wits clenly in no creature delectable / but if thy heart be
taken and e^gleymed with a vein lust and liking of it which puts out the
love of god fro the heart as in feeling. and the ghostly savor that it may not
come therein. Every man that lives in spyryte knowith well all this. This is the
wretchydnes of the soul and the myscheyf for the first sin of man / without
al other wretchydnes and sins which thou have wylfully put thereto. And wit
thou well though thou had never done sin with thy body dedely ne venyal but
oonly this that is called orygynal for it is first sin. and that is not else
but lesynge of thy ryghtfulnes which thou was made i^ should thou never have been saved if our lord Ihu^ christ by his precious passion had not delyuerde
the and restored ye again.

How every man may be saved by ye passion of christ be he never so wretched.

ANd therefore if thou think that I have here before spoken to hye to the. for
thou may not take it ne fulfylle it as I have said or shall say. I will now fall

without dout thou shall have it. And for this oryginal syn and al other thou

knowlegyng her wretchydnes: askyng mercy and foryeuenes and ye fruit of this
precious passyo^ only. lowyng he^self to the sacraments of holy church though
it beso yt they have been enco^bred with sin al her lyftyme / and never had
feeling of ghostly ^auour or swetnes or ghostly knowing of god:. they shallen
i^ this faith and i^ her good will by virtue of this precious passion of our
lord Ihu^ christ be saaf and come to ye bliss of heaven. All this know thou
well. but yet it lyketh me for to say it Se here y^ endless mercy of our lord how
low he falls to y^ and to me and to al synful caytyfs. The^ ask mercy and
have it / Thus said y^ prophet in ye person of our lord. Oi^s enim quicu^que
inuocauerit nome^ du^i. Iohi^s..x.
saluus erit Every man what yt he be yt calls ye name of god. yt is to say.
askith saluacyo^ by Ihu^ and his passyo^. he shall be saaf. This certesye of our
lord some me^ taken well and be^ saved thereby / and some men i^ trust of this
mercy and this courtesy lain still in her syn / and wene for to have it when he^
lust: and then mow they not. for they are taken or they were / and so they
dampne he^self / But then say tho^ / if this be soth then wonder I greatly
for yt I find in some holy men's books / Some saye^ as I understand yt he yt
can not love this blessed name Ihu^ ne find ne feel in it ghostly Joy and
delectable with ghostly swetnes. in the bliss of heaven he shall be alyene and
never shall he com thereto. Sothly these words when Ihem red stonyed me and made
me greatly aferde / for I hope as thou say yt by ye mercy of our lord shall be
saaf by kepy^g of ye commandments. and by very repe^tau^ce for her evil
living before done. which felt never gostli swetnes ne inly savor i^ ye name
of ihu^. and therefore I merueyl me ye more yt they say contrari herto as it
semyth / And unto this I may say as me thinks that her saying if it be
well understand is soth / and is not contrary to that y^ I have said. For this
name Ihesu is naught else for to say upon english but heler or hele / Now
every man yt lives in this wretchyd life is ghostly seek. For there is no man
that lives without sin which is ghostly syknes / as saint John^ says of
himself and of other perfyte men thus Si dixerimus qr pccm^ non habemus. Ioh
ip^i nos ceduci mus e^ veritas in nobis non est / If we say that we have no
sin we begyle ourself. and there is no sothfastnes in us. And therefore he
may never come to the Joy of heaven unto he be first made hole of this ghostly
sykenes. But this ghostly hele may no man have that has use of reason: but if
he desire it and love it: and have delight therein. i^ as much as he hopyth for
to get it / Now ye name of Ihu^ is nothing else but this ghostly hele /
Wherefore it is soth yt they say / that there may no man be saaf but if he love
and like in the name of Ihesu / For there may no man be ghostly hole / but if
he love and desire ghostly health / For right as if a man were bodily seek.
there were no erthly thing so dear ne so nedful to him ne so much should be
desired of him as bodily health / for though thou would give him all the
richesse and worshyppes of this world and not make him hole if thou might /
thou plesest him not / Right so it is to a man that is seek ghostly and felyth
ye pain of ghostly syknes / no thing is so dear ne so needful ne so much
coueyted of him as is ghostly health. and that is Ihesu / without which all the
Joys of heaven may not like hy^ And this is the skylle as I hope why our lord
wha^ he took mankind for our salvation he would not be called by no name that
betokenyd his endless being or his wysdom or his ryghtwysnes / but oonly by that
ye betokenyd the cause of his coming. and was the salvation of man's soul /
which salvation betokened this name Ihesu / Then^e by this it semyth soth that
there shall no man be saaf but if he love salvation oonly for to have it through
the mercy of our lord Ihesu: and by the merytes of his passion / which love
he may have that lyuyth and deyeth in the lowest degree of charity / Also I
may say on that other party that he that can not love this blessed name Ihu^
with gostly mirth ne increase i^ it with heavenly melody here / he shall never
have ne feel i^ heaven ye fulhede of souereyne Joy / the which he that might
in this life by abundance of perfyte charity in Ihesu shall feel and have / and
so may her saying be understand / Nevertheless he shall be faaf and have full
mede in the sight of god / if he in this life be in ye lowest degree of chartte
by keeping of goddis commauudementes / For our lord says himself thus / In
modo patris mei mansiones multisunt / In my faders house are many soundry
dwellynges / Some are perfyte souls ye which in this life were fulfilled of
charity. Io^h
and grace of the holy ghost / and song louynges to god in contemplacyon of
him with wonderful swetnes and heavenly savor / These souls for they had most
charity and grace of the holy ghost shall have highest mede in the bliss of heaven
/ for thise arn called goddis derlynge / Other souls that are not dysposyd to
contemplacyon of god. ne had not the fulhede of charity. as apostles and
marters had in the begyn^ynge of holy church. shall have lower mede in the
bliss of heaven / for these arne called goddis friends / Thus calls our lord
in holy writ chosen souls saying thus. Cant.
Comedite amici* et inebriamini carissimi / My friends ete ye. and my derlynges
be ye dronken: As if our lord said thus / ye that arne my friends. for ye
kept my commandments. and set my love before the love of the world / and
loved me more than any erthly thing ye shall be fed with ghostly fode of the
bread of life / But ye yt arne my friends that ye not oonly kept my
commandments but also of your own free will fulfilled my counceylles: and
over that ye loved oonly and enterly with all the myghtes of your soul. and
brenned in my love with ghostly delight as dyden pryncypally ye apostles and
marters. and all other souls yt might by grace come to the yeft of perfyccyon
ye shall be made dronken with the highest and fresshest wine in my celler / yt is

living a figure and a lyknes of the dygnytee that our soul might be reformed
as it were in a shadow by grace to the image of the trinyte / which we had by

conte^platyf unto begin here in that feeling of love. and ghostly knowing of

quench al holy the false vain love in thyself / ne fle al venyal sins yt
they ne will but if they be stopped by great fervor of charity spryng out of
thyn herr as water does fro a stynky^g well / but I would yt if thou might not
fully quench it. yt thou might so^what sleke it. and com to ye clen^es of
soul as ner^ thou may. for our lord behyt ye children of Israel wha^ he lad

And in figure of he^ to al cryste^ men thus / Omne quod calcauerit pestuus

foot of very desire. so here much shall thou have in ye lord of byhest / yt is
i^ ye bliss of heaven wha^ thou come thither /

How Ihesu shall be sought desired / and found. Caplm xlvi
Seek then that thou have lost yt thou might find it / well I wot who so might
ones have an i^warde sight a lytyl of that dygnytee and that ghostly fayrnes
which a soul had by kind. and shall have by grace / he should loathe and
despise in his heart all the bliss. the liking. and the fayrnes of this world
as the stynche of a carry on. and he shall never have will for to do other deed
night and day saving the freylte and the bare need of ye bodily kind but
besyre mourn. and pray and seek how he might come again thereto / Nevertheless
in as much as thou haste not yet seen what it is fully / For thy ghostly eye
is not yet opened / I shall tell the oone word for all the which thou shall
seek desire and find it. for i^ that one word is all that thou have lost /
This word is Ihesu / I mean not this word Ihesu painted upon a wall / or
written by letters on the book / or fourmyd by lyppes in sound of the mowthe /
or feyned in thy heart by traueyle of thy mind / For in this manner wise may a
man out of charity find him. But I mean Ihesu christ that blessed person god
and man son of vyrgyn mary. whom this name betokenith that is al goodness.
endless wisdom / love / and swetnes. thy Joy. thy worship. and thyn everlasting
bliss thy god: thy lord. and thy salvation / Then if it be so thou sele^t a
great desire in thyn heart to Ihesu. either by mind of this name Ihesu. or by
mind and saying of any other word / or in prayer. or in any deed y^ thou
do / which desire is somoche that it puts out as it were by strength al
other thoughts and desires of ye world / and of the flesh that they may
not rest in thyn heart. Then sechest thou well thy lord Ihesu And wha^ thou
felyst this desire to god / to Ihesu. al is one helped and comforted by a
ghostly might / in somoche that it is turned in to love and affeccion
ghostely savor and swetnes / In to light and knowing of sothfastnes / so
much that for the time the point of thy thought is set upon no thing yt is
made / Ne is felyth no styrynge of vayn glory ne of itself another / ne none
other evil affection / for they mow not appear that time / But only is
enclosed: rested. softed. enoynted in Ihesu / then have thou somewhat of
Ihesu. Not him as he is. but a shadow of him. For the better that thou fyndest
him / the more shall thou desire him / Then by what manner prayer or medytacyon
or occupacyon that thou may have grettest and clennest desire to him / and
have most felyng of hy^ by ye ocupacyo^ thou sechest him best and best fyndest
him Therefore if it come to my mind / as it were asking what have thou lost /
and what sechest thou Lift up thy mind and the desire of thy heart to Ihu^
christ though thou be blind and naught may see of his godhede And say y^ hy^
have thou lost / and him would thou have. and no thing but him / to be with
him where he is / None other Joy none other bliss in heaven ne in earth but him
/ And though it be so yt thou feel him in deuocyo^ or in knowing. or in any
other yefte what y^ it be / rest not there as though thou had dest fully
found Ihesu. But for yete y^. y^ thou have found / And always by desyryng
after Ihesu more and more for to find him better / as though thou had
right naught found in him / for wit thou well what yt thou felyst of him: be
it never so much. ye though thou were rauysshed in to the third heaven with
poul / yet have thou not found Ihesu as he is in his Joy / Know thou or feel
thou never so much of him / he is yet above it / and therefore if thou wol
fully find him as he is in ye bliss of loving cease thou never while thou
lyuest / ne of ghostly desiring /

What profit it is to have the desire of Ihesu Caplm xlvii
SOthly I had lever feel and have a sothfast desire and a clean in mine heart to
my lord Ihesu crist. though I see right little of him with my ghostly eye than
^or to have without this desire al ^odely penance of all men living / al
vysyons or reuelacyons of au^gel sapperyng. songs and sowninges. savors and
smelli^ges bren^inges. and any lykynges or bodily felynges / And shortly for to
say. or al ye Joy of heaven and of earth which I might have without this desire
to my lord Ihu^. Dauyd the prophet felt as I say as I understood when he
said thus. P. lxxi^
Quid enim michi est i^ celo and ate quid volui super terra^ Lord what thing
is to me in heaven / or what would I without ye above earth / As if he had said
thus / Lord Ihu^ what heavenly Joy is lykyng to me without desire of y^ whiles
I am i^ earth / or without love of y^ when I come to heaven / as who say: right
none. The^ if thou will feel oni thing of hy^ bodily or ghostly / couey^e not
but for to feel sothfastly a desire of his grace and of his mercyfyl presence: P
yt ye thinks y^ thyn heart may find none other rest i^ no thing but in hy^ /
Thus coueyted david wha^ he said thus / Co^cupiuit anima mea desiderare
iustificaciones tuas i^ om^e te^pore / Lord my soul coueyted y^ desire of thy
ryghtwysnes i^ every time Seek the^ as david did desire by desire / And if
thou may feel by thy desire in prayers and i^ medytaco^ns ye homely presence of
Ihu^ crist in thy soul / bind thyn heart fast thereto y^ it fall not therfro.
And if thou sto^ble. that thou may soon find him again /

Where and with what thing Ihu^ shall be sought and found Caplm xlviii
Seek then Ihu^ who^ thou have lost / He will be sought / and he may then
so^what by founden. for he says himself / Omnes qui querit inueniet. Every man
y^ sechyth shall find / The sekyng is traueylous. but the fyndyng is blysful /
Do therefore after ye counseylle of ye wise man if thou will find hy^ / Si
quesieris quasi pecunia^ sapiencia^ and sicut thesauru^ effoderis illa^: pro^.
xx.
tunc intelliges timore^ dn^i and scie^cia^ inuenies / If thou seek wisdom y^
which is Ihu^ as silver and gold and deluest deep there after thou shall find
it The behouyth for to delue deep i^ thyn heart. for therein he is hylde / and
cast out full cle^ly alloues and lykynges sorrows and dredes of al erthly
things / and so shall thou find wysdo^ Ihu^ / Be thou then like to ye woman
of ye gospel of y^ which our lord says thus / Que mulie^ habens dragmas
dece^. Luc. ih
etc. what woman is yt. y^ has lost a drame yt she ne will light a lantern and
cast her house up so down and seche till she find it / As who say none. And
when she has fou^den it she calls her friends and says to he^ thus / Makyth
mirth with me and melodye. for I have fou^den the drame yt I had lost / This
drame is Ihu^ yt thou have lost / And if thou will find hy^ light up a
la^tern yt is gods word as dauyd says / Lucerna pedibm meis verbu^ tuu^ /
Lord thy word to my fete is a la^tern / By this lantern shall thou see where
he is and how thou shalt find hy^: p^. cxv. iii*
And if thou will thou may with this light up an other lantern. yt is the
reason of thy soul / For as our lord ^ayth / Lucerna corporis tui est oculus
tuus. The la^terne of thy body is thy bodily eye. Right so may be said yt ye
lantern of thy soul is reason. by ye which yt soul may se al ghostly things
By this la^tern may thou find Ihu^ and yt is soth if thou hold up the lantern
fro underneath / the busshel. luc: io:
as our lord says / Nemo accendit lucerna^ and ponitea^ sub mo di^ sed super
candelabru^ There is no man yt lyghteth a la^tern for to set it under a busshel
but upon a candelstycke That is to say / Thy reason shall not be ouerlayd with
erthly besynes ne vain thoughts and erthly affeccyons but aye upward above
al vain thoughts and erthly things as much as thou may. and if thou do so
thou shall see then all the molle and al ye fylthe and small motes i^ thy house
for why he is light / That is to say al flesshly loves and dredes in thy soul
/ Not al. for as david said / Delicta quis i^telliger / who may know al his
trespasses* As who say no man / and thou shall cast out of thyn heart all such
sins and swepe thy soul clean with ye besome of ye dread of god / and with
the water of thyn eye^ wasshe it. and so shall thou find thy drame Ihesu. He
is drame he is penny. he is thine heritage / This drame will not be founden so
lightly as it is said / for this work is not of one hour ne of one day / but
many days and years / with much sweet and swynke of body and traueyle of the
soul / and if thou cease not but seche besely sorrow and syghe deep / mourn
stylly / and stowpe low till thyn eyes water for anguysshe and for pain for
thou have lost thy tresour Ihu^ / at the last when he will well shall thou find
thy drame Ihesu And if thou find him as I have said. that is if thou may in
clennes of conscience feel the homely and the peesful presence of that blessed
name Ihesu christ as a shadow or a glemerynge of him / Thou may if thou will
call all thy friends to the for to make mirth with the and melodye for thou
have founden the drame Ihu^.

Where Ihesu is lost and founden again thorugh his mercy / Caplm xlix
SEe now then the curtesye and the mercy of Ihu^ thou have lost him* but where
/ Sothly in thy house / that is in thy soul. That is to say / if thou had
lost all the reason of thy soul by the first sin thy soul should never have
found him again / but he left to the thy reason. and so he is in thy soul /
and never shall be lost out of it / Nevertheless thou art never the nerer to him
till thou have found him / He is in the though he be lost fro the / But thou
art not in him till thou have found him / Then was this his mercy that he
would suffer him to be lost oonly where he may be found / It needs not to
run to Rome ne to Iherusalem for to seche him there / but turn thy thought
i^ to thyn own soul where he is hid. as the prophet says / Ueretues deus
absconditus. Sothly lord thou art an hid god / and leche him there. Thus
says himself in the gospel / Simile est regnum relorum thesauro absco^dito in
agro. M. iz.
que^ qui inuenit homo abscondit and pregaudio illius dadit. et vendit vniuersa
que habet. et emit agrum illu^ / The kingdom of heaven is lykened to a tresoure
hyd in the field. the which when a man fyndeth for Joy of it he gooth and
sells all that he has and byeth the field / Ihesu is tresour hid in thy
soul / Then if thou might find him in thy soul. and thy soul in him / I am
syker for Joy of it thou would give the lykyng of all erthly thing for to have
it / Ihesu slepyth in thy heart ghostly. as he did sometime bodily when he was
in the ship with his discyples But they for dread of perysshynge wakened him.
and soon after he saved hem fro tempeste / Do thou so. styre him by prayer /
and wake him with great cryenge of desire / and he shall soon rise and help
the /

What lets a man to here and see Ihesu within himself / Caplm^ L
Nevertheless I hope better that thou slepest ofter to him than he does to the /
For he callyth ye full often with his sweet pryue voys / and styreth thyn heart
full stylly y^ thou sholdest leave al other Ianglyng of al other vanytes in thy
soul / and oonly take keep of him for to here him speak Thus says dauyd of
our lord / Audi filia and vide et inclina aurem tuam and obliuiscere populu^
tuu^ and domum patris tui. My daughter here and see and bow thyn ere to me.
and foryete the folk of thy worldly thoughts. and the house of thy flesshly
and kyndely affeccyons / Lo here may thou see how our lord callyth y^ and al
other which will harken to him / what lettyth the then that thou may another see
him ne here him / Sothly there is so much dynne and cryenge in thyn heart of
vain thoughts and flesshly desires that thou may another here him ne see him /
Therefore put away unrestful dynne. and break the love of sin and of vanytee
/ and bring in to thyn heart love of virtues and full charity. and then shall
thou here thy lord speak to the.

That mekenes and charity be^ ye specyallyuerey of Ihu^ through the which
man's soul is reformed to ye lyknes of him / Caplm^ li
AS long as Ihu^ fyndeth not his image reformed in the. he is strange and
the ferther fro ye For thy shape the for to be arrayed in his lyknes / that is
in mekenes and charity / the which arne his lyuereys And then will he homelyche
know the / and show to the his pryuytees / Thus said he himself to his
dyscyples Ioh. xiiii.
/ Qui diligit me diligetur a patre meo et manifestabo ei meip^m / Who so
loves me he shall be loved of my fader and I shall show myself unto him There
is no virtue ne no work that thou may do ye thou may make the like to our
lord without mekenes and charity / for these two arne specially to god most
leyf / And y^ semyth well in the gospel where our lord spekyth of mekenes thus
/ M. ii.
Discite a me quia mitis sum and humilis cord / Learn of me he said not for to
go bare foot ne for to goo into Deserte / and there for to fast forty days /
ne yet also for to chese you dysyples But learn of me meknes / for I am mylde
and meke in heart / Also of charity he says thus. Hoc est peccatum meu^ vt
diligatis inuicem sicut dilexi vos Item / In hoc cognoscent omnes qr discipuli
mei estis. Ioh. ih
si dilexcionem habueritis ad iuuicem / This is my bidding that ye love you
together: as I loved you / for in that shall men know you for my dyscyples / Not
for ye work miracles / or caste^ out deuylles: or prechen or teache. but if
echone of you love other in charity / And if thou will be like to him have
meknes and chayte / That charity is / that thou know dest well / love thyn even

HOw a man shall find the ground of sin within himself / Caplm lii
NOw have thou herd a lytyl what thy soul is. and what worship it had / and
how thou lost it / And also I have told the that this worship might by grace
and besye traueyle somewhat be recovered again in party of feeling / Now shall I
tell febly as I can how thou shalt mow enter in to thyself for to se the
ground of sin. and for to destroy it as mache as thou may / and so shall
thou mow recover a part of the dignite / Thou shall cease for a time fro all
bodily works. fro al outward besynes as thou may well / Then shall thou draw
in to thyselfe thy thought fro thy bodily wits / y^ thou take no keep what
thou herest or see or felest / so that the point of thyn heart be not fyched
on hem. And after this draw in nerer thy thought fro all manner imagining if
thou may fro all bodily thing / and fro all thoughts of thy hodely deeds
before done. or of other men's deeds / This is little maystry for to do when
thou have deuocyo^ / But thou shall do thus wha^ thou have devotion / For then
it is right much the harder / and set thine intent and thy full purpoos as thou
would not seche ne feel ne find but oonly the grace and the ghostly presence
of Ihesu / This is traueyllous / for vain thoughts wyllen prees in to thine
heart thycke for to draw thy thought down to hem / And if thou do thus thou
shalt find somewhat not Ihesu whom thou sekest but only a nakyd mind of his
name. what the^: Sothly but thus thou shall synde a derke image and a paynful
of thyn own soul. which has another light of knowing ne felyng of love ne
lyky^g This ymake if thou be hold wittely is al vmbylapped with black
striky^g clothes of syn / as pride. envy. re Accidye couetise Glotenye and
lecherye / This is not the image of Ihu^. but it is an image of sin / And
saint poul callyth it a body of sin and a body of death / This image and this
black shadow thou berest about with the where so thou ghost. Out fro this
spryngen many great stremes of sin and small also. Right as out of the image
of Ihesu. if it were reformed in the bemes of ghostly light sholden stye up to
heaven / as brennyng desires: clean affeccyons. wise thoughts. and al honestee
of virtues / Right so out of this image spryngen styrynges of pride. of envy.
and of such other the which casts the down fro the honestee of man in to a
bestes lyknes

To what thing is the image of sin like. and what it is in it self Caplm
liii.
NOw perauenture thou beginnest for to think unto what thing this image
should be like / and therefore yt thou sholdest not long study there about / I
tell y^ that it is like to no bodily thing / What is it the^ say thou
Sothly it is naught. and that may thou find if thou will assaye as I have
said to the. Draw in to thyself thy thought fro all bodily things / and then
shall thou find right naught wherein thy soul may rest / This naught is no
thing else but derknes of conscience. a lacking of love and of light / As
syn^e is naught but a wantynge of good / if it so were that the ground of
sin were much abated and dried up in the: and thy soul were reformed right
to thymage of Ihesu then if thou drew in to thyselfe thy heart thou sholdest
not find naught / but thou sholdest find Ihu^ / Not oonly the naked mind of
this name. but thou sholdest find Ihu^ christ in conscience redely techyng y^ /
Thou sholdest find light of understanding: and no derknes of vncu^nyng / Thou
sholdest find love and lykyng of him and no pain of bytternes and heaviness /
But for thou art not reformed therefore when thy soul comes in fro al bodily
things. and fyndeth naught but derkenes and heaviness / him thinks an hundred
winter to he be out again by some bodily delight or vain thought / and yt is no
wonder / For who so comyth home until his house and fyndeth no thing therein but
s^ynke and smoke* and a chiding wife he would soon run out of it / Right so
thy soul when it fyndeth no comfort in it self but black smoke of ghostly
blyndnes / and great chydyng of flesshly thoughts cryenge upon the that thou
may not be in peace / sothly it is soon weary till it be out again / This is the
derknes of conscience /

Who so will find Ihesu him behouyth abydyngly traueyle in ghostly derkenes
against the image of sin Capitulum liiii
Nevertheless in this derke conscience behooves ye to swynke and sweet / That is
to say / The behouyth to draw in to thyself thy thought fro al bodily things
as much as thou may / And then when thou fyndest right naught fro all bodily
things as much as thou may / And then when thou fyndest right naught but
sorrow and pain. and blyndnes in this derknes / if thou will find Ihesu the
pain of this derke conscience the behouyth suffer. and abide a while therein.
And here the behouyth to be waar that thou take Ihesu christ in thy thought
against this each derkenes in thy mind / And by besye prayer and fervent desire
to god / Not sitting the poyne of thy thought in that foresaid naught / but in
Ihesu christ which thou desyrest / Think styfly on the passion and on his
meknes and thorugh might of him tthou shall arise / Do as thou would bear it
down and go through it. Thou shall agryse and loathe this derknes and this
naught right as ye devil: and thou shall despise it and al to breast it / For all within this naught is Ihu^ hid in his Joy whom thou may not find by thy
sechyng / but if thou pass the derknes of conscience. This is the ghostly
traueyle ye I speak of / And this traueyle is cause of all this writing. for to
styre yt thereto if thou feel grace / This derkenes of conscience and this
naught yt I speak of is the image of the first adam Saint poul knew it well /
for he said thus of it / Sicut portauimus ymagine^ terreni hominis. little. iij
ita portemus ymagine^ iam and celestis / As we have here before borne the
image of the erthly man yt is the first adam. Right so that we might now bear
the image of ye heavenly man which is Ihesu ye second ada^ / He bare this
image often full heavy / for it was so comberous to him yt he cried out on it
saying thus / O quis liberabit me de corporis mortis huius / O who shall deliver
me fro this body and this image of death / And then he comforted himself and
other also thus / Gracea dei per thm^ xp^m / The grace of god by Ihesu christ /

What is propyrly the image of sin / and what comyth out thereof / Caplm^. lv
NOw have I told the a lytyl of this image how it is naught / nevertheless if
it be fer fro thy knowing how it might be an image / for naught is but naught*
but so might thou not lightly understand it. I shall tell the more openly of
this image as me thinks This image is a falls mysruled love unto thyself Out
fro this comen al manner of sins by seven Ryuers which arne these / Pride.
Envy Ire. Accidie. couetyse. glotenye. and lechery. Lo this is somewhat yt
thou may feel / By one of these ryuers ren^eth out al manner of syn and puts
the out of charity if it be dedely syn^e / or it lets ye fervor of charity
if it be venial Now may thou grope yt this image is not nout / but it is much
of bad for it is a great spekyng of love unto thyself with such vii. ryuers as
I have said / But now say thou how may this be soth / I have forsaken ye
world / and I am stoken in an house / I meddle with no man / I chyde not / I
strive not / I neither by ne selle / I ne have no worldly besynes but by ye
mercy of god I keep me chaste and with hold me fro delytes / And over this I
pray I wake / I traueyle bodily and ghostly as I may / How should then this
image be so much in me as thou spekest of / As to this I a^swere and grant
to ye / yt I hope thou do al thy se works and moo thereto. and yet may it
be soth as I say. Thou art besye upon thy myt for to stop ye ryuers with oute^
/ but the spryng within on hap thou leuest hole / Thou art like to a man the
which had i^ his yerde a sti^kyng well with many ren^ynges fro it. He yede and
he stopped the renninges and left the spryng hole / and wend al had be syker /
but the water sprange up at the ground of ye well / and stood still somoche y^
it corrupted all the fayrnes of his garden / and yet re^neth no water out /
Right so may it be with ye / If it be so yt thou have by grace stopped y^
ryuers of this image without / so much it is well / but beware of ye spring
within / Sothly but if thou stop and cleanse yt as much as thou may it will
corrupt al y^ flowers of the garden of thy soul / show the never so fair
outward in sight of men. But now say thou / whereby shall I know yt the
ground is stopped / if I traueylle about it / As unto this I shall tell by
assaye how thou shall know this image if it be in the / and how much it is in
the / and thereby shalt thou wit how much it is stopped and how lytyl also
in the / And asmoche as pride is the pryncipal Ryner I shall tell y^ thereof
first /

What pride is. And when it is syn. Caplm lvi
Pride is not else as clerks saye^ but love of thine own excellence. yt is
of thyn own worhyp / Then the more thou love and lykest in thyn own
worship. the more is the pride \ and so the more is the image in yt / If thou
feel in thyn heart a styryng of pride / thon that art holyer. wyser better and
more virtuous than a another is / ye god has yeuen the grace for to serve him
better than other done / and thou thynkest al other byneth ye and the abouen
hem / or any other thought of thyselfe which shows to thy sight of thy soul
an excellence and an ouerpassynge of other me^ or wymmen / and of this styryng
thou felyst love and delight and vain plesyng in thy self that thou art so /
this is a token that thou berest this black image / which if it be preue for
men^es eyes. nevertheless it shows him openly in gods sight. But mow say
thou yt thou may not flee such styringes of pride / for often thou felyst he^
against thy will. and therefore thou hold he^no syn / or if they ben syn they
ben naught but venyal. As to this I say thus that the feeling of these
styrynges of pride or of any other the which spryngen out either of y^
corrupcion of this foul image or by incastynge of the enmye. it is no syn^e in
as much as thou felyst hem. and that is a grace and a pryuylege by virtue of
the passion of Ihesu christ granted to al christian men baptized in water and in
the holy ghost. For so^hly to Jews and sarazyns which trow not in Ihesu
christ. all such styrynges are dedely sins. For saint poul says. O m^e quod
non est exfide pc^m^ est / All that is done withouten truth in christ is dedely
syn / But we christian men have this pryuylege of his mercy that such felynges
are no syn^e. but they are pain of ye orygynal sin / Nevertheless when by
neclygence and by blyndenes of thyselfe this felyng is received unwarily in thy
thought. and turned in to love and liking / then is there sin more or less
after the mesure of the love / sometime venyall / and sometime dedely / when it
is venyall and when dedely / fully can I not tell y^ / Nevertheless a lytyl I
shall say as me thinks /

When pride is dedely sin. And how it is in flesshely living men dedely
sin: Caplm lvii.
THen the styryng of pride is received and turned in to liking somoche that
the heart cheseth it for a full rest and a full delight. and secheth none other
end but oonly lykyng therein / then is this pride dedely syn / for he makyth
and chesyth this delight as his god without aye^ stondyng of reason and of will
and therefore it is dedely sin But now say thou / what fool is he yt would
these pride as his god / no man yt lives would do so / As unto this I say
that I can not tell the in specyal who syn^eth in pride dedely / but in
general I shall say y^ There is two manner of pride / The cone is bodily pride /
the other is ghostly pride / Bodily pride is of flesshly living men Ghostly
pride is ypocrytes and heretykes. These three syn^e dedely in pride / I mean of
such a flesshly living man as saint poul spekyth of thus / Siscdm carne^
vixeritis moriemini / If ye live after your flessh ye shall deye. Then say I
thus that a worldely man which loves and sechyth pryncypally ye worship of
him self. and chesyth the liking of it. as rest of his heart and the end of
his bliss he synneth dedely. But now say thou. who would chese love of his
worship instead of his god As to this I say thus. that he that loves his
worship as for to seem better and gretter of astate than any other / and
traueyleth about it as much as he may if he love it somoche that for the
getynge of it the keeping and the saving of it he brekyth the commandment of
god or brekith love and charity to his even christian. or is ready and in full will
for to break it rather than he should forbere his worship. or lose it either of
his name or of his state or of fulfyllyng of his will: sothly he synneth dedely
/ For he louyth his worship and cheseth it more than the love of god and of his
even christian / And nevertheless the man y^ synneth thus dedely he would say
with his mouth y^ he will not chese pride for his god. But he begyleth himself
for he chesyth it by his deed. Nevertheless a another worldly man that louyth
worship of himself / and pursues thereafter if he love it not so much yt he
would for the getyng or the saving of it do a dedely sin or break charity to
his even christian / he synneth not dedely but venyal more or less after the
mesure of his love and his liking with other cyrcumstaunces /

How pride in heretykes is dedely syn / Caplm lviii
AN heretyke synneth dedely in pride. for he chesyth his rest and his delight
in his own opinion and in his own saying / for he weneth yt it is soch /
which opinion or saying is against god and holy church / and therefore synneth
he in pride dedely for he louyth himself and his own will and wit so much
y^ though it be openly against the ordinance of holy church he will not leave
it but rest him therein as in soch fastnes. and so makyth he it his god / but he
begyleth himself / For god and holy church arn so onyd and accorded together
y^ who so does against that one he does ayenste both / And therefore he that
says he loves god and kepyth his byddynges / and dispyseth holy church. and
sets at naught the laws and the ordynaunces of it made by y^ head and the
sovereign in governance of al christian men / he lies he chesyth not god. but
he chesyth ye love of hy^self contrary to the love of god / and so he syn^eth
dedely / And in that he weneth most to plese god he most dysplesyth him / for
he is blind and will not see / Of this blyndnes and this false restyng of an
heretyke in his own felinge spekith the wise man thus / Est via que videtur
homini recta / et nouissima eius ducu^t ad morte^. prou^xn^
Three is a way which semith to a man ryghtful / and y^ last end of it
brings him to endless death / This way specially is called heresye / For
other flesshly syn^ers that synnen dedely and lain theri^ comynly they suppose
amiss of hemself. and felen bytyng in conscience that they go not in the right
way But an heretyke supposes that he does well and techeth well and yet no man
so well / And so weneth he that his way were the right way / and therefore
felyth he no byryng of conscience ne mekenes in heart / And sothly but if god
send him mekenes of his mercy. at the last end he gooth to hell / And
nevertheless yet weneth he for to have done well and gete^ him ye bliss of heaven
for his techynge /

How pride in ypocrytes is dedely syn / Caplm^ lix.
THe ypocryte also syn^eth dedely in pride / He is an ypocryte that cheseth
vain Joy of himself. as ye rest and the full delight of heart upon this manner
of wise / when a man does many manner of good deeds bodily and ghostly and
then is put to his mind by suggesto^n of the enmye beholding of himself and
of his good deeds / How good how holy he is how worthy in men's dome / and
how high in gods sight abouen other men. he perceyueth this styryng and
receives it wylfullly for he weneth it be good and of god in as much as it is
soth for he does thyle good deeds better tha^ other me^ And when it is received
thus by assent of his will as good year ryseth of it alone and a delight in his
heart of him self yt he so much grace has that it rauyssheth his my^de out of
al other thoughts both ghostly and flesshly for the time and settyth it in
vain Joy of himself as in a rest of his heart / This rauysshynge in ghostly
pride is delectable / and therefore he kepyth it holds it and noryssheth it as
much as he may. For this love and vain delight he prays and waketh: he
fasteth and wereth ye hair and does other afflyccyons: and all this greueth
him but lytyl / He loves he thanketh god sometime with his mouth / and sometime
wryngeth a tere out of his eye: and then^e he thinks al saaf enough / But
sothly all this is for love of himself which he cheseth and receives as it
were love and Joy in god / and in that is all the sin / He chesyth not sin
wylfully as for sin / but he chesyth this delight and Joy that he felyth for
god / as the rest of his soul the which is sin withouten dysplesyng or
aye^stondyng of will / For he weneth it were a Joy in god / and it is not so /
and therefore synneth he dedely Job says thus of an ypocryte / Gaudiu^ ypocrite
ad inster pu^cti / Si accenderit in celum superbia eius. Joy. ^o
and caput eius nubes tetigerit. velut sterquilineum in fine perdetur / The
Joy of an ypocryte is no more than a point / For if he stye in to heaven with
reysynge of heart / and his heued touch the skies at the last end he shall
be casten out as dounge hepe. The Joy of an ypocryte is but a point / For if
he worship himself never so much. and Joy in thymselfe never so much
all his life time / and depeynte himself with al his good deeds in sight and
in loving of the world / at the last it is right naught / but sorrow and
pain / But now say thou that there are few such or else none that is so
blind that would hold and chose vain Joy i^ himself as for Joy in god / As
unto this I can not say ne will not though I cowde / but one thing I tell the
that there are many ypocrytes / And nevertheless they wene that they ben none /
and that be many that drede^ hemselfe as ypocrytes / and sothly they are none /
which is one and which is other god knows / and none but he / who so will
mekely dread. he shall not be bygyled And who so weneth to be syker. he may
lightly fall / For saint poul says / Qui seexistimat aliquid esse cu^ nithil
sit. Ga^l. ^
ipsi se seducit / who so weneth hy^self to be ought when he is right naught /
he begyleth himself /

How styrynges of pride and vaynglory in good me^ ben but venyal sins / Caplm
lx.
Nevertheless a man or a woman which dysposyth him to live contemplatyf / if it
be so that he forsake himself as in will / and offer him holy to god with a
full general will that he would not sin i^ pride wyttyngly. ne have Joy in
himself wylfully but oonly in god if he cowde and might / And after this full
will offered to god he felyth many styrynges of vaynglory / and delyteth in him
for the time for he perceyueth he^ not This liking is but venyal syn^e and
namly if it be so that when he comyth to himself he repreuyth himself and
ayenstondeth this styryng with dysplesyng of will and askyth mercy and help of
god / Then the lykng which before was sin / our lord of his mercy soon
forgyueth it / And yet he shall have mede for his good traueyle in the
ayenstondynge / And yt is a curtesye of our lord granted to al those which
arne specially his servants and more homly of his court / as are al those yt
for his love forsaken in a good true will al worldly and al flesshly syn / and
even he^ holy body and soul unto his seruyse her might and her cu^uyneg / As
done principally ancres encluse and true relygous / the which for the love of
god and salvation of her souls entren in to any relygyon approved by holy
church / Or else if it be so yt they entre^ first for a worldly cause as for
her bodily sustenaunce / or for some other such. if they repent he^ and turn
it in to a ghostly cause as for the service of god / These as long as they
keep this will and pursue it as they may upon her freelte are true relygyous /
Also what man or woman yt he be in what degree he be in holy church priest
clerk or lewd man / wydowe or maiden or wife yt will for the love of god and
saluacyo^ of his soul forsake al ye worshippes and lykynges of this world in
this world in his heart truly and fully betwyx god and him and al wylful
besynes and erthly things to the bare need / And offer his will enteerly for to
be his sernaunt upon his might by devout prayers and holy thoughts / with
other good deeds that he may do bodily and ghostly and kepith his will hole to
god steadfastly / Al these arne specially gods servants in holy church /
And for this good will and good purpoos yt they have of the yefte of god they
shall encrese in grace and in charity here living. And they shall have for
this specyal will a specyal mede in the bliss of heaven before other chosen
souls which offered not holy her will and her body to gods service /
neither openly ne pryuely as they dyden / Al these which I call goddis
servants and of his court more special / if they by freelte and by
vncunnynge when they feel such styrynges of vayn glory for the time delyten
therein / and perceyuen it not for her reason and her wit is let by the
liking yt they feel that it may not see this styryng. They syn not dedely in
this lykyng of vaynglory / For yt will yt they have generally set in her heart
before to plese god / and for to forsake al manner of syn if they knew it
kepyth he^ here in such styrynges and in all other that comen of freelte that
they sin not dedely. And shall keep as long as ye grunde of that will is kept
hole /

How diverse states in holy church shall have dyu^rs medes in heaven / And of two
specyal medes in heaven. Capitulum / lxi
ANd over this I say more in comfort of the and al other having the state of
anchor incluse. and al so by grace of god in comfort of hem all that enter any
relygyon approved in holy church / that al those yt by ye mercy of our lord
shall be saaf they shall have a specyal mede and a singular worship in the
bliss of heaven for her state of living before other souls that had not ye
state in holy church though they ben never so holy / which worship is better
than all the worship of this world withouten comparyso^ / For if thou might se
what it were thou would not for the worship of this world if thou myghtest
have it withouten sin change the state either of anchor or of relygyous. ne
lose that synguler mede in ye bliss of heaven / which mede is called
Accydental mede / Nevertheless that other men mystake not this that I say /
Therefore I shall say it more openly / Thou shalt understand that there are
two medes in the bliss of heaven / which our lord given to chose^ souls /
The tone is souereyne and pryncypall / As is louyuge and knowing of him after
the mesure of charity yeuen of god to a soul living in dedely flesh / This
mede is best and souereyne for it is god himself And it is common to all the
souls that shollen be saaf in what state or degree that they ben living in
holy church more or less / after the quantite and ye mochenes of her charity
in his life what degree he be in. For he ye most loves god in charete. he shall
have most mede in the bliss of heaven / For he shall most love god and know
him and that is the souereyne mede / And as for this mede it shall fall that
some manner of man or woman as a lord or a lady / knight / or squyre /
machaunte / or plough man. or what degree he be in man or woman shall have more
mede than some priest / or friar / monk / chanon / or anchor incluse. And why /
Sothly for he loved god more in charity / An other mede there is / that is
secundary which our lord gives for special good deeds that a man does
wylfully over that he is bounden to / Of three deeds pryncypal doctors of holy
church maken mind / Of marterdome. prechynge. and manhood / These three works
as for an excellence in as much as they passen al other shall have specyal mede
which they callen aureole. And that is naught else but a synguler worship and
specyal token ordained of god in reward of ye specyal deed before other men /
that did not so over the souereyne mede of love of god / which is common to
him and to al other / Right so it is of al other specyal good deeds / the
which if they ben done sothfastly arne specially acceptable to the sight of
god / and in ye dome of holy church they arne excellent / As arne enclosynge
of ankers done by ye auctoryte of holy church / Also entryng i^ to any
relygyon approved: And the streyghter that the relygyon is the more excellent
is the deed in the dome in holy church /

Also after these and byneth these the taking of the order of priest either for
cure of men's souls / and for to mynyster the sacraments of holy church /
Or else for synguler devotion to pleyse god and profyten her eue^ christian by
the sacryfyce of the precious body of our lord Ihu^ christ / Sothly they arne
specyal deeds. and excellent openly showed in the dome of holy church / and in
ye sight of our lord / when they arne done sothfastly for god they arne
excellent / and they shullen have specyal mede each man in his degree in the
bliss of heaven / The state of bishop and prelate is abouen al these deeds as
for this accydentall mede / That this is sothe it semyth by holy writ where
it says thus in the prophet Danyel. danyel
Tu autem vade ad tempus perfinitum et requiesces et stabis in sort tua in
fine dierum / This is for to say thus much / The au^gel when he had showed to
Danyel the pryuytees of god he said to him thus / Goo thou to the rest of thy
bodily death / and thou shall stand in thy sort as a prophet at the last
day / And sothly as Danyel shall stand as a prophet at the last day of
dome and have the worship and the excellence of a prophet over ye souereyne
blessed mede of love and sight of god / Right so shalt thou stand as an anchor
in that sorce / and a relygyous in the sort of relygyo^. And so of other
excellent deeds / and have a synguler worship passing other me^ at the day of
dome /

A short stirynge to mekenes and charity Caplm lxii
NOw by these words thou may if thou wolte trow hem / conceive comfort for
thy degree of living / and also matere of mekenes / for though it be so yt thou
shall have so much mede specially for thy state of liui^g if thou be saaf /
nevertheless it may be yt there is many a wife and many worldlyche woman shall be
nerer god than thou and more shall love god and better know him hta^ thou shall
for all thy state / And that ought to be ashame for the but if thou be beye for
to get love and charity as fully and asperfytly as a worldely man or woman /
For thou may have as much charity of the gift of god as he or she has that
dwellyth stylle in worldely besynes thou shall have as much of ye souereyn
mede as he shall And thou shall over that for that state which thou have taken
have a synguler mede and a worship which he shall not have / Then if thou will
do well meke thyselfe and forgete thy state as it were ryt naught For it is
soth. by it self it is right naught / And ye thy desire be and thy besines for
to destroy sins / and for to get charity and mekenes and other ghostly
virtues / for therein lies al /

How a man shall know how much pride is in him Capitulum. lxiii
I Have nyghe forgoten this image / But now I turn again thereto / if thou
will wit how much pride is therein / Thou may yet assaye thyself thus Look
now wisely / and flater not thyself / if loving praysynge or worshyppynge. or
flesshly favor of worldelymen or of other be lykyng to thyn heart. and torn it
to vain gladness and will payeng of thyself / Think stylly in thine heart that
men sholden praise thy life / reward thy speech more than of other / And also
on contrary wise / if it be so ye men repreue the / and setten y^ at naught
Hold the but a fool or an ypocryte / or if they sclau^der the. or speak evil
of the falsely / or in any other way that they disease the vnskylfully / And
for thy thou felystin thine heart a grievous heaviness against hem / and a great
rysyng in thyn heart with ayenstondyng for to suffer any shame or vylanye in the
sight of ye world / If it be thus with the it is a token that there is much
pride in this derke image seem thou never so holy in the sight of me^ For
though these styrynges ben not but lytyl and venyal / nevertheless they shown
well that there is much pride hid in the ground of thine heart / as ye fox
dares in his den / These styrynges with many moo spryngen out of this image
so much yt thou may uneaths do any good deed but it shall be meddled with some
pride or vain delight in thyself / And so with thy pride thou defowlest al thy
good deeds / and makyth hem loothsom in the sight of thy lord / I say not
that they are lost. for they are meddled with this pride / But I say that they
are not so pleysaunt to thy lord as they should be if they were simple and
truly roted in ye virtue of mekenes / And therefore if thou will have clennes
of heart for to come to the love of god / the behooves not oonly flee the rest
of thyn heart in vaynglory by wylful assentyng to pride / and also the recheles
liking therein of thy freelte if it be a yenst thy will / But also ye felyng of
thy pride thou shall flee and eschew as much as thou may / But y^ thou may
not do but if thou be full quycke and reedy about the kepyuge of thine heart /
as I shall tell after /

Of Envy and ire and of her branches / And how instead of sin mannys
person is often hated / Capitulum / lxiiii
Turn this image up so down / And look well therein / and thou shall find two
members of envy and ire fastenyd thereto / with many diverse branches spryngyng
out of them / The which letten love and charity / the which thou sholdest
have to thyn eue^ christian / The branches of ire and envy are these / Hatrede.
evil suspecyon / falls and vnskylful demynge / malecolye rysynge of heart against
hem / dyspysyng and unkindness. and bacbytynge. and myssayeng / unskillful
blamyng. myslykyng. anguysshe. and heaviness against he^ ye dyspysen the or speak
any evil of the or against the. A gladness of her dysese / a felnes against synful
me^ and other y^ will not do as the thinks they should do with great desire of
thine heart under color of charity and right wysnesse yt they were well
punysshed and chastysed for her syn This styryng semyth good / Nevertheless if
thou ransake it well thou shall find it more sometime flesshly against the
person than ghostly against the sin / Thon shall love the man be he never so
sinful / and thou shall hate the sin in each man what he be / Many are
begyled i^ this / for they set the bitter instead of ye sweet and taken
derknes in the stead of light against the prophet saying Ue vobis que dicitis
malu^ bonu^ and bonum malu^ ponentes lucem tenebras and amaru^ dulce. ysay. ij.
Woo be to hem that sayen good is evil and evil is good and setten light as
derkenes. and bitter instead of sweet. Thus done all tho ye when they should
hate ye syn of her even christian. and love the person / they hate ye person instead of the syn. and wene yt they hate the sin / wherefore it is a craft by
it self who so cowde do it well /

That it is maystry to love men's persons and wisely hate her sins / Caplm
lxv
IT is no maystry for to wake and fast till thyn head ache. ne for to run to
Rome and to Jerusalem upon thy bare fete / ne for to sterte about and preche.
as if thou would torue al men by thy prechyng / Ne it is no maystry for to
make chyrches and chapels: for to feed poor men and make hospytals. but it is
as maystry a man to love his even christian in charity and wisely hate the sin
of him and love the man / for though it be so yt al these deeds before said
are good in he^self. nevertheless they are common to good men and to bad / For
each man might do hem if y^ ^e would and had whereof / And for thy for to do ye
each man may do I hold it no maystry / But for to love his even christian in
charity and hate his sin / may no man it do but oonly good men which have
it of y^ yefte of god and not of her traueyle. To. ij.
as saint poule says / Caritas dei deffusa est in cordibus vestris per sp^m
sccm^ quidatus est vobis / Love and charity is shed and spread in your hertes by
the holy ghost. which is yeuen to you / And therefore it is more precious and
ye more daynte for to come by / All other good deeds withouten this make not a
man good ne worthy ye bliss of heaven. but this alone: and oonly this makes a
man good and al his good deeds medeful / Al other yeftes of god and works of
man are common to good and badde / to chosen and to reproved / But this yeft of
charity is oonly of god and of chosen souls /

That for ye same deeds diverse men shall have diverse medes. Caplm lxvi
A Good man for the love of god fasteth waketh. gooth on pilgrimage / and
forsakyth all the lykynges ye world sothfastly in his heart withouten feynyng
he shall have his mede in the bliss of heaven / And an ypocryte for vaynglory of
himself does the same deeds / and receives his mede here Al^o a very precher
of gods word fulfilled of charity and of mekenes sent of god and of holy
church received if he preche and teache gods word / he shall have a special
mede of god / yt is the aureole for his prechyng / An ypocryte or an heretyke
yt has no mekenes ne charity. ne arne send of god nor yet of holy church /
if they preche they have her mede here / Also a good man in worldly state for
love of god makyth many chyrchis / chapelles: abbeys. hospytals / and does
many other good deeds of mercy / he shall have his mede in ye bliss of heaven /
not for ye deed in it self / but for ye good will and the charity yt he has of
ye yeft of god for to do tho good deeds / An other man for vanytee of himself
and worship and plesynge of the world. and for his own name does the same
good deeds and has his mede here / The cause is in all these that the tone has
charity and y^ the other none which is one and which is other our lord knows
and none but he.

That al men's good deeds shall be aproued that has lyknes of good. saaf the
opyn heretyke and the cursyd man. Caplm lxvii
ANd therefore we should love and worship al me^ in our hertes: aproue examyn
and receive all her deeds yt have the lyknesse of goodness though the doers in
gods sight ben bad save of the opyn heretyke and of the opyn ^ursyd man / Of
these two specially we shall flee and esc^ewe the presence and the coming with
he^. And we shall reprove and refuse her deeds seem they never so good as long
as they arne rebel to god and holy church / As if a worldly cursed man make a
church or feed poor men thou may sykerly hold it naught and deem it as it is
/ Also if an opin heretyke which is rebel to holy church preche and teache /
though he convert a hundred thousa^de sonles / hold the deed as to himself
right naught / For these men are openly out of charity / without which is al
naught that a man does /

That no good deed may make men saaf without charity / And that charity feel
they oonly y^ ben meke Capitulum / lxviii
ANd therefore it is a great maystry a man to cun love his even christian in
charity / All this saying may be openly proved by saint poules words thus. p^.
little. iz.
Si linguis hominum loquar and angelorum / caritatem non habuero. nichil sum /
Et si habuero omne^ fidem ita vt mo^tes transfera^. caritatem aute^ no^ habeam.
nichil su^. Et si nouerim misteria oi^a. et si destribuero om^es facultates
meas in cibos pauperu^ / et tradidero corpus me um igni vt ardeam / caritatem
autem non habuero nichil michi prodest. Saint poul in praysyng of charity says
thus / If I speak ye langage of all men and of angels also / if I have no
charity I am right naught / And if I have so great faith that I may turn
hills and bear hem away / and I have no charity I am right naught And also
though I had al manner of knowing of al pryuytees / without charity I am right
naught / And if I give al y^ I have to poor men and my body to the fire to be
brent. and I have no charity it profyteth me right naught / Here it semyth by
saint poules words that a man may do al good deeds bodily withouten charity /
And that charity is naught else but for to love god and his even cryste^ as
himself. How should then any wretched caytyf living in earth what yt he be have
delight or trust or sykernes in himself for ought that he can or may do with all
his bodily myghtes or his kyndely reason / sith all this is naught worth
withouten love and charity to his even christian / And this charity may not be
gotten with werkynge of himself / for it is a free yefte of god sent in to a
meke soul / as saint poul says. who then dare hardely say that I have
charity or I am in charity / Sothly no man may say it sykerly. but he that
is perfytly and sothfastly meke / Other men may trow of hemselfe / and hope
that they ben in charity by tokens / But he that is perfytly meke felytth it /
and therefore might he sykerly say it. Thus meke was saint poul / and for thy
said he thus himself / Quis seperabit nos a caritate dei. To viii
Tribulaco^ an angustia. etc / who shall depart me fro ye charity of god.
Tribulacio^ or a^guyssh. etc And he answers himself and says / There shall
no creature put me fro the charity of god which I have i^ christ Ihesu / Many
men done deeds of charity and have no charity as I have said. For to reprove a
sinner for his sin to his amendynge and in couenable time it is a deed of
charity* but to hate the sinner instead of the sin: it is against charity /
he that is verily meke can depart that one fro that other. and no man but he /
For though a man had al moral virtues of al philosophers he cowde not do this /
He should cu^ne hate the sin in all other men for he hates it in himself /
But he cowde not love ye man in charity for all his phylosophye / Also if a man
had knowing of al clergy and of dyuinite / and be not sothfastly meke he shall
lightly err and stomble and take the one for that other But mekenes is worthy
to receive a yefte of god the which may not be learned by cunning of man /
And therefore he that is meke can hate ye sin and truly love the man. But now
parauenture thou begynnest to dread for that I have said that charity may not
be gotten by no work that thou may do / How shall thou then do / As unto this
I say that there is no thing so hard to get as charity / this is soth as
within our traueyle. And on the contrary wise I say yt there is no yefte of
god that may so lightly be had as charity: For our lord yeuith no yeft so
freely ne so gladly ne so comynly as he does charity. How shall thou then
have it say thou Be meke and low in spyryte and thou shall have it. And what
is lyghter for to do tha^ for to be meke. Sothly no thing. Then semyth it
that there is no thing that so lightly may be had as charity. and therefore the
needs for to be much adradde Be meke and have it. This said James thapostle.
Deus superbis resistit. hu^ilibus aute^ dat gracia^ / Our lord he says
ayenstondeth proud men / but to meke men he yeueth grace / which grace is
propyrly his charity / for after the mesure of thy mekenes so shall thou have
charity / if thou have mekenes inperfitly oonly in will: not in affecco^n. then
shall thou have inperfyte charity This is good / for it suffyseth to salvation
as dauyd says. Inperfectu^ meum viderunt oculi tui / P.
Lord with thyn eyes of mercy thou see mine inperfeccyo^ / But if thou have
mekenes perfytly then shall thou have perfyte charity. and y^ is best / The
the other behouyth us nedely to have it if we will be saaf. and this should we
desire \ Then if thou ask me who is perfitly meke / thou shall no more have of
me of meknes at this time but this / He is meke y^ sothfastly knowith himself
as he is /

How a man shall wit how much wrath and envy is hyd in the ground of his
heart / Caplm lxix
NOw turn yet aye^ to this image if thou wolt assay how much ire and envy
is hyd in thyn heart that thou felyst not / Look well and behold thyself wisely
when such styrynges of ire and envy against thine even christian spryngen out of
thyn heart / The more styred that thou art by malencoly bitter or wicked will
against him. the more is this image in the / For the more thou gru^chest by
inpacyence either against god for any trybulacyon or syknes or other bodily
dysese sent of god / or against thyn even christian for ought that he does
against the / the less is the image of Ihesu reformed in the. I say not that
such grutchynges or flesshly angrynes arne dedely sins / but I say that
they letten the clennes of heart and pees of conscience that thou may not have
full charity by the which thou sholdest come to life contemplatyf / For that
end is the purpoos of al my saying. yt thou sholdest not oonly cleanse thyn
heart fro dedely sins. but also fro venyal as much as thou myghtest / And yt
the ground of sin might by grace of Ihesu christ somewhat be slecket in the /

By what tokens thou shall know if thou love thin enmye / And what ensample
thou shall take of christ for to love him / Caplm lxx
FOr though it be so yt thou felyst none evil against thyn even christian for a
time / yet art thou not siker that the ground of ire is quenched in ye / ne
yet art thou not lord of the virtue of charity / For suffer him towche the a
lytyl by angry or a shrewde word / and thou shall feel anon if thyn heart be
yet made hole by fulness of charity / The more thou art styred and evil wylled
against the person. the ferder art thou fro charity / And if thou naught be
styred against the person. neither by angry chere outward. ne by no preuy
hate in thy heart for to despise and deem him or for to ser him at naught. but
the more shame or velanye he does to the in word or in deed the more pity and
co^passyon thou have of hy^. as thou would have of a man yt were out of his
mind / And the thynkyth thou can not find in thyn here for to hate him. for
love is so good in himself / but pray for him and help him / and desiring his
amendynge / not oonly with thy mouth as ypocrytes can do. but with affection
of love in thyn heart / then have thou perfyte charity to thyn even christian /
This charity had saint stephen perfytly when he prayed for hem yt stoned him
to deed / This charity cou^seyled christ to those y^ would be his perfyte
folowers wha^ he said thus / Diligite inimicos vro^s ^n^facite hus qui oderunt
vos. etc. M. v.
Loves your enmyes and do good to he^ yt hate^ you / prays for he^ y^
pursuen you. And therefore if thou wol follow christ be like to him in this craft
/ Let for to love thyn enmyes and synful men / for all these arn thy even
christian / Look and bethynke the how christ loved Judas which was both his
dedely enmye and a synful caytyf. How goodly christ was to him. how benygne.
how curteys / and how lowly to him yt he knew dampnable / and nevertheless he
chase him to his apostle: and sent him for to preche with other apostles / He

is as I understand ye techyng of saint Austyn for to depart ye love of the

Lift well up this image and look well about / and thou shall mow see couetyse
and love of erthly things occupye a great party of this image. though it seem
lytyl Thou have forsaken richesse and much honor of this world / and art
spered in a dongeon / but have thou forsaken clenly the love of all this / I
hope not yet / It is less maystry for to forsake worldly good than to forsake
the love of it / Parauenture thou have not for saken thy couetyse / but thou
have changed it fro great things in to small / as fro a pownde unto a penny /
and fro a silver piece unto a dysshe of an halfpeny This is a simple change /
thou art no good merchant / These ensamples arne chyldysshe / nevertheless they
betoken more / If thou trow not me assay thyself / If thou have love and
delight in the having and holding of any thing yt thou have such as it is /
with ye which love thou fedest thyn heart for a time. Or if thou have desire
and yerni^g for to have some thing yt thou have not / with which desyrethyn
heart is traueyled and strouble^ by v^skylful business that the clean desire
of virtue and of god may not rest therein / this is a token yt there is couetyse
in this image And if thou wolte assay better / look if any thing that thou

thou love worldly goods / For thus done worldly men / when her good and her
richesse is taken fro he^ they arn heavy sorry angry and chyding and stryusg
against he^ yt have it openly by word and by deed / but thou do all this in
thyn heart pryuely where god sees and yet thou art in more defawte than a
worldly man. For thou have forsaken in lyknes ye love of worldly things / But
a worldly man has not do so / and therefore he is excused though he strive and
pursue for his goods by lawful ways for to have hem aye^ / But now say
thou yt the behooves for to have thy necessaryes of such things as lo^gen to

Asmoche sorrow as thou have in lesyng of a thing. so much love had thou i^

sothfastly felt desire of ghostly things / and had there with all a sight of
the leest ghostly thing yt is. all ye love and the lykyng of any* erthly thing
thou sholdest set it at naught / it should not cleue upon the / For to love
and for to have more than ye needs skylfully oonly for lust and lykyng it is
a defawte / Also for to fetchen thy love upon yt thing that the needs for it

the needs withouten love of it more than kind or need asks withoute^ which
the thing may not be used / it is no defawte / Sothly in this point as I trow
many yt I have ye state and ye lyknesse of pouerte arn much let and hyndred
fro ye love of god I ne accuse no man ne no state reprove / for in each astate
some arn good and some arne other / But one thing I say to every man or woman
that has taken the state of wilful pouerte whither he be relygious or seculer
or what degree he be in / as long as his love and his affection is bounden and
fastened. and as it were glewed with the love of any erthly thing that he has

that louyth any thing with the / that he loves not for the / For the more
love and couetyse of any erthly thing is with the / the less is the love of
god in thyn heart / For though it be so that this love of erthly thing puts
he^ not out of charity but if it be so much that it strangle ye love of god
and of her even christian / sothely it hyndreth he^ and lets hem fro the
fervor of charity / and also fro ye specyal mede which they should have in
the bliss of heaven for perfyte pouerte / and that is a great loss if they
might se it / For who so might know ghostly mede how good how precious and how
worthy it is / for it is aye lastyng / he would not for the love of al erthly
Joy or hauour of al erthly thing eyf he might have it withouten sin let ne

my heart that if I may not have it in myself as I say. that I might have it
in ye / Or in any other creature which has received more plente of his grace
than I / But see now then sith couetyse in the naked ground lets a man
or a woman so much fro the ghostely feeling of ye love of god how much more
then it lets and combrethe wordly men and wym^en the which by all her
wits and bodily besynes night and day study and traueyle how they might
get riches and plente of worldly good / They can none other delight have but in
worldly things / ne they will not for they seche it not / I say no more of he^

yEt may thouse more in this image though it be derke. and that is flesshly

do for ghostly delight which thou felyst in the soul / I grant ye forsooth
yt thou then synnest right naught therein / for then can thou well ete and sleep
/ Sothly and withoute^ doubt I am full far fro ye knowing and ferder fro ye
werching For to ete I have by kind / but to cu^ne ete I may not but by the
grace of god. Saint poul had by grace this cunnyng as he says himself thus /
Ubique and in oi^bus institutus su^. Phil. iiii.
scio saciari and esurire / habu^dare and penucia^ pati: Oi^a possu^ in eo qui
me comfortat. I am informed and kenned in all things. For I can hunger and I
can ete. I can with plente and I can with pouerte / I may al in him ye
strenghthyth me \ Saint austyn said till our lord thus. Augus.
Lord thou have teched me yt I should take mete as a medycyne / Hunger is a
syknes of kind / and mete is a medicine thereto / Therefore ye lykyng ye comith
with all in asmoche as it is kyndly and nedful it is no syn^e / but when it
passyth into lust and into wylful likyng then it is sin / And therefore
ther^lyeth al ye maystry for to cu^ne depart wisely need fro lust and wylful
lykyng they are so knyt together / and ye one comyth with ye other. so yt it is
hard for to receive that one as ye need and repreue that other as wylful lust
yt which often comyth under color of need / Nevertheless sith it is so yt need
is ye ground of this. and ye need is no syn / for be a man never so holy him
behooves to ete and drink and sleep therefore ye lust and ye liking that
comes under the color of this need and passyth this need is ye less syn /
For a man synneth not dedely comynly in glotenye. but if he be enco^bred with
other dedely sins beforn done / then may he ye lyghtlyer syn^e dedely in this
/ For it is soth he that chelyth ^ust and lyking of his flesh and delytes i^
welfare of mete or drink as full rest of his heart that he would never have
other life ne other bliss but live ever in such lusts of his flesh if he
might. it is no dowte but yt he synneth dedely / for he loves his flesh more
than god / But he that lies indedely syn of pride or envy or such other he
is so blinded by ye devil that for ye time he has no power of his free will /
and therefore he may not well ayensto^de flesshly lykinges when they come but
falls down wylfully to hem as a be does to caryo^ / And in asmoche as he
has no general will before to god pryncipally by cause that he is in dedely
syn. therefore ye lust of glotenye yt which he falls i^ lightly is to hy^
dedely syn / for he makith none aye^sto^dyng general ne specyal. But a another
man or woman which in grace and charity has always a good general will to god
in his soul wheder he sleep or wake ete or drink or what good deed yt he
does / so yt it be not evil in itself by yt which will and desire he chesyth
god above al thing. and has lever forbere al thing of ye world than wrath
his god for love of him / This will though it be but general it is of so great
virtue by ye grace of our lord Ihu^ yt if he fall by freelte in lust and in
lykyng of mete and of drink or of such other syknes. either by excess of
tomoche eting or to often or to gredely or to lustly. and delycatly. or to sone
i^vntyme. it saves hy^ and kepith hy^ fro dely syn^e / And this is soth aslong
as he is in charity by other deeds. and kepyth his general will to al ye he
does. and namly if he know among his own wretchydnes and cry after mercy.
and be in purpose specially to ayensto^de such flesshly lusts for our lord
is good and merciful. and these venyal sins of glotenye he foryeueth right
sone unto a meke soul / For the styryng and ye lykyng of glotenye in asmoche
as they are hardest for to flee by cause of need of ye bodily kind among al
other sins are most exscusable and leest peryllous / And therefore thou shall
not rise against ye ground of this syn as thou shall against all other sins \
for ye ground of this syn is oonly need which may not be escaped but if thou
wylt do worse as slay yt need as many foles done / which sholden slay y^ theyf
and spare the true man / That is to say / They sholden slay vnskylful lust and
yt wylful lykyng. and spare and keep ye bodily kind. and they do not so. But
against al other sins thou shall arise for to destroy not oonly dedely sins
and ye great venyals / but also against ye gounde of he^ as much as thou may
/ See by this skylle / Thou may not live without mete and dri^ke / but thou
may live without lecherye if thou wy, and never but ye better / And therefore
thou shall not flee only ye deed of it which is dedely syn but also wylful
lykyng of it in thyn heart withouten deed which is venyal syn / and sometime it
is dedely / but also thou shall traueyle against ye ground of it for to
destroy ye felyng and the rysyng of flesshly string /

How the ground of lecherye should be destroyed with ghostly traueyle and with
bodily / Caplm lxxiii
BUt this travail against the ground of lecherye shall be ghostly / as by
prayers and ghostly virtues and not by bodily penance. For wit thou well yt if
thou fast and wake and scourge thyselfe / and do al yt thou can / thou shall
never have ye clennes and ye chastyte without ye yefte of god and the grace of
mekenes / Thou sholdest sooner slay thy self than thou sholdest slay flesshly
styrynges and felynges of lust and lecherye either in thyn heart or in thy
flesh by any bodily penance / But by the grace of Ihu^ in a meke soul ye
ground may be much stopped and destroyed and the spryng may be much dried /
And yt is very chastyte in body and in soul / On the same manner may be said
of pride and of couetyse and of such other. for thou myt live if thou were not
proud ne covetous / and therefore thou shall destroy al ye felynges of he^
asmoche as thou may But in glotenye thou shall rise and smite away ye
vnskylful styrynges. and save ye ground hole /

That a man should be besye to put away al styrynges of syn / but more besy of
ghogly sins than of bodily / Capitulum / lxxiiii
ANd therefore he that ryseth against the feeling of flesshly lykyng in mete and
drink more fully and more sharply than of pride or couetise / which for they
semen fayraren not lightly reproved / Or of Envy. or of Lecherye / I say that
he is half blind / For he sees not yet ghostly uncleanness / As of pride and
envy how foul it is in goddys sight / I hope If a man might see with his eye
ghostly how foul pride and couetyse arne in the sight of god / and how
contrary to him / He should more loath a styryng of pride and the vain lykyng
of it / And also he should the more agryse and rise against ye evil will of envy
or ire to his even christian than many a styrynge or liking either of glotenye
or of lecherye / Nevertheless al men wenen not so / For comynly men arn more
eschew for to feel a styring of flesshly sin / and have for it more sorrow
and heaviness than for the great lykynges in vaynglory or in other ghostly
sins / But they arn not wise / For if they will understood holy writ and
doctors sawes thereof / they sholden find as I say / which I ne may ne will
rehearse now / I will not excuse hem ye fall in lykynges of glotenye and lecherye
yt they sin not For I wot well yt all the spyces of hem arn syn^e more or
less after the mesure of the lust of the sin and other lykynges with
wylfull cyrcumstaunces / But I would yt thou knew and charged al / ylke a
sin as it is / more the more / as arn ghostly sins / less the less arn as
flesshly sins. And yet shall thou nevertheless hate and flee al both bodily and
ghostly upon thy might / For wit thou well ye flesshly desires and vnskylful
lykynges in mete and drink Or any lykynges ye longen to ye body passing
reasonable need. though they ben not always great sins to him yt is in charity
/ nevertheless to a soul ye desyre^h clennes and ghostly feeling of god they
arn full heavy paynful and bitter and much for to eschew. For the spyryte may
not feel his kyndly savor within. till the flesh have lost his bestly
savor withouten

That hunger and other bodily pains lets much ghostly werching / ca. lxxv
ANd therefore if thou wolt come to clen^es of heart the behouith ayensto^de
vnskylful styryng of flesshly desires / But against the ground thou shall not
rise. as I have said before / For the ground of it is need. as kyndely hunger
which thou shall nedelynges feel and tent thereto in time / and help thyself
against it by medycyne of mete. as thou would help thyselfe reasonable against
a bodily syknes / yt thou might more freely serve god both bodily and ghostly
/ For wit thou well what man or woman that shall be occupied ghostly in
thoughts / vnskylful pain or hunger wylfully taken or bodily syknes in the
stomach or in ye head / or in other party of the body for ye defawte of good
rulyng of him self. by tomoche fasting. or by any other wise / shall much let
the spyryte / and much hinder him fro ye knowing and beholdynge of ghostly
things / but if he have the more grace / For though it be so that bodily pain
/ either of penance or of syknesse or else bodily occupacyon sometime lets
not the fervor of love to god in devotion / but often encreasyth it /
Nevertheless I hope that it lettyth the faruour of love in contemplacyon the
which may not be had ne felyd sadly but in rest of body and of soul /

as for need: But be well waar of lust that commyth with need / Eschew to much
as well as to lytyl And so when thou haste done / and then it commyth to thy
mind ye bytyng of conscience that thou haste eten to much. And so then
begynnest for to tarry the / and draw to ouermoche bytternes / Lift up ye
desire of thyn heart thy good lord Ihu^ and know thyself for a wretch and a
be / and ask him for gyuenesse. and say that thou will amend it / and
trust of forgyuenesse / Leave of then and tarry no longer with all / ne strive
not much as thou would destroy it utterly / for it is not worth for to do
so / Thou shall never bring it so abowte \ but redely ordeyne the read to
some other occupacyo^ bodily or ghostly / after thou felyst the dysposed that
thou myghtest more profit in other virtues / as meekness and charity. For
wit thou well he that has in his desire and in his traueylle none other
reward to none other thing but to mekenes and charity / aye cryenge after hem
how he might have hem / he shall in that desire / werchynge follow and after
profit and wexe in all other virtues / as in chastyte abstinence and such
other if he have but lytyl reward in hem in a year more than he should
withouten this desire profit in seven / if he strive with glo^enye lechery and

curyous and fair things / and so of other wits / By the unskillful using
of these wits in to vanyte wylfully / thy soul is much let fro ghostly
wits within / and therefore the behooves stoppe^ these wyndowes or spear hem /
but oonly when need asks for to open hem /

That the soul for defawte of knowing of itself gooth out by five wyndowes to
seche outward liking. Capitulum / lxxix.
ANd that were lytyl maystry to yt if thou myghtest ones see thy soul by clear
understanding what it is and how fair it is in his own kind / Ne it were
that it is so ouerlayed with a black ma^tel of this toule image. but for thou
knowyst it not. therefore thou leuest the inly sight of thy self and sechest thy
mete forth withonten as a be unreasonable. thus says our lord ma^nassynge
to a chosen soul in holy writ. Cani. i
Si ignoras te o pulcra inter mulieres. egredere and abi post vestigia gregu^
sodalium tuorum et pasce edos tuos / Thou fair among wymmen if thou know not

the get / and it is thus much for to say. Thou soul fair by kind made to
the lyknesse of god freel as a woman in the body for the first sin by cause
that thou know not thyself / that angels food should be thy delyces therein
/ Therefore thou ghost out by thy bodily wits and sechest thy mete and thy
lykyng as a best of the flock / that is as one repreuyd / and therwyth thou
fedest thy thoughts and thine affeccyons which arne unclean as gotes / It is
a shame to the for to do so /

That a soul should not beg without forth but within of Ihesu that it
needs. Caplm lxxx
ANd therefore turn home again in thyselfe and hold the within / and beg no
more withouten namely swynes mete / For if thou will algates be a beggar ask
and crave within of thy lord Ihesu / for he is rich enough / and gladlyer wol
give yt than thou wolt ask / And run no more out as a best of the flock /
yt is a worldly man or woman that has no more delight but in his bodily wits
/ And if thou do thus thy lord Ihesu wol give the all that the needs / For he
may led the in to his wine celer / and make the for to assay of his wynes
which the lyketh best for he has many tonnes Thus a chosen soul Ioyenge in
holy writ says of our lord / Introduxit me rex in cellam vinaria^ / A king
Cant. con
ladde me in to a wine celer / And that is for to say / In as much as I
forsake the dronkennes of flesshly lusts and worldely lykynges / which arn
bitter as wormode / for thy the king of bliss lord Ihesu led me in / That
is to say / First in to my self for to behold and know myself / And after
he led me in to his celer / yt is to say. abouen myself by ouerpassynge
oonly in till him. and gaaf me assaye of his wine / yt is for to taast a syknes
of ghostly swetnes and heavenly Joy / Thise arn not words of me a wretchyd
caytyf living in synue / but they arne words of the spowse of our lord in
holy writ / and these words I say to the that thou might draw in thy
soul fro withouten / and follow after as thou may /

That ye hole of ymagynaco^n needs to be stopped as well as ye wyndowes of ye
wits / Caplm^ lxxxi
BUt now say thou that thou do so / thou see no worldly things ne
herest none. ne have uone use of thy bodily wits more than need asks / and
for thy tho uart enclosed / As to this I say / If thou do thus as I hope thou
do then have thou stopped a great wy^dow of this image. but yet art thou
not siker. for thou have not stopped the pryue holes of the imagining in thyn
heart / For if thou see me not with thy bodily eye thou may see me in thy soul
by ymagynacyon / and so may thou do of all bodily things / Then if thy soul
be fed wylfully by ymaginacions of vanytees of the world / and desyryng of
worldly things for a wylfull comfort and ease / sothly if thy soul be within
as for ye bodily wits. it is nevertheless full far withouten by such vain
ymaginaco^n / But now ask thou whether it be any great sin a soul for to
occupye him in such vanytees either in wits or in ymagynyng / As unto this I
say that I would ye thou would never ask man this questyon / For he that
will sothfastly love god he askyth not comynly whether this is greter sin or
this / For him shall think what thing lettith him fro the love of god is great
sin / and him shall think noothynge sin but that thing which is not good /
and lets him fro ye love of god / What is sin but a wantynge or a
forberyng of good / I say not that it shall be paynful to him as a dedely sin
or a venyal should ben. ne I say not but that he knows dedely fro venyal and
more flees it /

is to this purpoos / Five yockes of oxen betoken the five wits which arn
beestly as an ox. Now this man that was called to the supper was not repreued
for he boughte these oxen / but for he yede for to assaye he^ and so he would
not come / Right so say I to the / For to have thy wits and use hem in
need. it is no sin / But if thou go wylfully for to assaye he^ by vain
delight in creatures then it is syn / For if thou chese that delight as for a
fynall rest of thy soul. and as a full liking / that thou kepest none other
bliss to have but such manner wordly vanyte then it is dedely / for thou
chesest it as thy god / and so shall thou be put fro ye supper / For saint poul
forbede us yt we should not assay our wyttis so when he said thus / Post
co^cupisce^cias tuas non eas. Thou sholt not go after thy lustis. ne will fully
assaye thy lykynges / A man or a woman yt is enco^bred with dedely sin shall
not well escape dedely sin in this though he see it not / but I hope it
touches not ye Nevertheless if thou by freelte ye delight i^ thy wits and /
such vanytee / but in yt thou kepest the in charity in other sides / and thou
chesest not this delight for a full rest of thy soul but thou set aye god
before al thing in thy desire / this sin is venyal after the cyrcu^staunce
more or less / ne thou shall not for these venyall sins be put fro the
supper in the bliss of heaven / but thou shall want the taastyng and the
assayeng of that dylycate supper living in earth / but if thou be besye with all
thy myghtes for to ayenstonde such veyal sins For though it be so that
venial sins break not charity / sothly they let the fervor and the ghostly
feeling of charity /

How a ghostly man or wnman shall have he^ to hem yt come to hem / Caplm lxxxiii
BUt now say thou that thou may not keep the fro heryng of vanytees. for
diverse men worldly and other come often for to speak with the. and tell the
some tales of vanyte. As unto this I say thus / ye coming with thyn even
christian is not much against ye but helpyth ye sometime if thou werche wisely /
For thou may assaye thereby the mesure of thy charity to thyn even christian
whether it be much or lytyl / Thou art bounden as each man and woman is to
love thyn even christian pryncypally in thyn heart and also i^dede / for to show
hem tokens of charity as reason asks after thy might and after thy knowing /
Now sythen i^ is so that thou owe not to go out of thyn house for to seek
occasyon how thou might profit thyn even christian by deeds of mercy / by cause
thou art encloos. nevertheless thou art bounden for to love hem al in thyn
heart / and to hem that come to yt to show he^ tokens of love sothfastly. And
therefore who so wylspeke with the what that he be. or in what degree yt he be.
and thou know not what he is ne why he comyth / be soon ready with a good will
for to wit what his will is / Be not dangerous ne suffer him not long abide
the / but look how ready and how glad thou would be if an angel of heaven
would come so and speak with the. so ready and so buxome be thou in will for to
speak with thine even christian when he comith to the for thou wotest not what he
is ne why he comyth ne what need he has of y^ or thou of him till thou have
assayed / And though thou be in prayer or in devotion yt the thinks looth for
to break of. For ye thinks thou sholdest no^l eve god for no ma^nys speech /
me thinks not so in this caas / For if thou be wise thou shall not leave god.
but thou shalt find him and have him and see him in thyn even christian as well
as in prayer / But on a other manner thou shall have him than in prayer / If
thou can well love thyn eue^ christian it should not hinder yt for to speak with
hem dyscretly / Dyscrecyon shall thou have on this manner as me thinks / Who
so comyth to the ask him mekely what he will / And if he come for to tell his
dysese and for to be comforted of thy speech here him gladly / and suffer him
say what he will for ease of his own heart / And when he has done comfort
him if thou can gladly. goodly and charitably. and sone break of / And then
after yt if he will fall in to idle tales or vanytees of the world or of other
men's deeds / answer him but lytyl ne feed not his speech / and he shall soon
be weary. and sone take his leave / If it be an other man that comith for to
teache the as a man of holy church here him lowely with reverence for his order
/ And if his speech comfort the ask of him. and make the not for to teache him
/ It talleth not to ye for to teache a priest but in need / If his speech
comfort the not answer little. and he will sone take his leave / If it be a
another man yt comes to give yt his alms or else for to here the speak. or
for to be taught of ye. speak godely and mekely to hem all repreue no man of
his defawtes / it falls not to the but if he be the more homely with the that
thou wotest well that he will take it of ye And shortly to say as thou
conceyuest that should profit thyn even christian namly ghostly may thou say
if thou can and he will take it / And of al other things keep scilence asmoche
as thou may / and thou shall in short time have but lytyl prees that shall
let the / Thus me thinks do better if thou can /

Of the derke image of sin / and of the clothyng there of / Caplm lxxxiiii
BY this that I have said may thou see a lytyl the derknes of this image of
sin / not for I have dyscryued it fully to the as it is for I can not /
Nevertheless by this lytyl thou may see more if thou look well / But now say
thou whereby wotest thou that I bear such an image about with me as thou
spekest of / As on this I can answer / I may take upon me a word said Osee
ir
by the prophet / and it is this / Invent idolum michi That is to say / I have
found a falls image that men callen a mawmente in myself well foul dysfygured
and for shapen with wretchydnes of al these sins which I have shoken of / by
the which I am casten down in many flesshly lykynges and worldly vanytees fro
clennes of heart and feeling of ghostly virtues more than I can or may say /
and that me repents and I cry god mercy / By this wretchydnes that I feel in
myself more than I have said may I y^ better tell the of thyn image / For all
come we of adam and of eve clothed with clothes of a bestes hyde / as holy
writ says of our lord thus. Gen^. 3
Facit deus ade and vxori eius tunicas pelliceas / Our lord made to adam and
to his wife clothes of a bestes hyde / In token that for his sin he was
forshapen like to a best / with which bestly clothes we al ben borne and
vmbylapped and dysfygured fro our kyndely shappe.

Which ben the lymmes of the image of sin / Caplm / lxxxv
Then is this a ugly image for to look upon / The head is pride / For pride
is the first and Ecc. io
pryncypal sin as ye wise man says / Iniciu^ oi^s pcti^ superbia / The
beginning of al manner of sin is pride / The back and the hinder party of it
is couetyse. Phil. 3
as saint poul says / Que retro sunt obliuiscens in anteri ora me extendo / I
shall for yete al worldly things which arne backewarde / and I shall stretche
me forward endless things / The breast in the which is the heart is envy /
for it is no flesshly sin but it is a deuels sin as the wise man says /
Inuidia diaboli mors intrauit in orbe^terrarum. Sap^. r
Imitantur illum oe^s qui ex part eius sunt / By envy of y^ devil death
comyth in to al ye world / For thy al tho that are of his party follow him
there in. The arms of it are wrath in asmoche as a man wreketh him of his
wrath by his arms against cristis bidding in the gospel. M. hi.
Si quis te percusserit super vnam maxillam prebe sibi alteram / If a man smite
the upon the tone cheke with his ho^de. thou shall not smite him again but offer
him yt other cheke. The belly of this image is glotenye as saint poul says /
Esca ventri et venture escis. p^. ccrum..con.
deus hunc and has destruet / Mete serves to the belly / and the belly serves
to get mete / but god shall destroy both belly and mete / That shall be at the
last end in the full reformynge of his chosen and in demynge of reproved / The
members of it are lecherye of the which saint poule says thus / No^ exibiatis
me^bra vestra arma iniquitatis ad peccatum / ye shall not give your members
specially your pryue members for to be arms of sin / The fete of this image
are accydye / Therefore the wise man says to the slow for to styre him to
good works / Discurre festina suscita amicum prou^. con
tuum / That is to say / Run quyckely about unto good works and haast the
soon / for the time passyth / and reyse up thy friend which is Ihesu by
devout prayer and medytacyon / Here have thou herd the members of this image.

Whereof the image of Ihesu is made. and whereof the image of sin / and how we
ben passing for the in ye image of sin. Caplm^ lxxxvi
THis is not ye image of Ihesu it is lyker an image of the devil / For the
image of Ihesu is made of virtues with mekenes and perfyte love and charity but
this is of false flesshly love to thyselfe with all these members festnyd thereto
This image berest thou and enery man what that he be until by grace of Ihesu it
be so^ dele destroyed and broken down / Thus it semith that dauyd says in ye
sawter book / Ueru^ptamen in ymagine pertransit homo. sed in frustra
co^turbatur: Pm viii
This is for to say / Though it be so that a man were made in ye beginning to
the image of god stable and steadfast / nevertheless by cause of syn he
forpassyth living in this world in this image of sin. by the which he is
unstable and trowbled in vain / Also saint poul spekith of this image thus /
Sicut portauimus ymagine^ terreni hominis sic portemus ymaginem celestis / That
is to say If we wol come to the love of god / as we have here before borne the
image of the erthly man. first adam that is the image of sin. Right so now
let us bear the image of the heavenly man Ihesu which is the image of virtues

WHat shall thou then do with this image / I answer the by a word that the
Jews said to pylat of christ. Ioh. icon
Crucifige eum / Take thou this body of sin and do him on the cross / That
is for to say / Break down this image and slay the false love of syn^e in
thyself as cristis body was slain for our sin and our trespaas Right so the
behouith if thou wolte be like to christ ^lee thy bodily liking and flesshly

/ These yt arne crystys folowers has crueyfyed and slain her flesh that is
the image of sin with all the lusts and the vnskylful lykynges of it / Slay
then and break down pride. and set up meekness / Also break down ire and
envy and reyse up love and charity to thyn even cryste^. Also instead of
couetyse. pouerte in spyryte / Instead of accydye. fervor in devotion with

/ ye shall put down the old man that is ye image of sin of the old adam with

What profit comyth of keeping of y^ heart / And how much the soul is. and
what it louyth / Caplm^ lxxxviii.
GAder then thyn heart together and do after the counsel of ye wise man when
he says thus. Om^i custodia serua cor tuum. prou^ iiii
qm^ exip^o vita procedit / With all thy besynes keep thyn heart. for out of it
comyth life And that is sothe when it is well kept / For then^e wise thoughts
clean affeccyons and brennynge desires of virtues and of charity and of ye
bliss of heaven comynour of it / and makyth the soul to live a blessed life /
Also on ye contrary wise if it be not kept / then as our lord says in the
gospel / De cord exiuit togitationes male que coinquinant hominem / Evil
thoughts and unclean affeccyons comen out of the heart the which defoulen man
as our lord says / They either benymme the life of ye soul by dedely sin.
Or else they feeble the soul and maken it syke if they ben venyall / For what
is a man but his thoughts and his loves / These maken a man oonly good or
badde / As much as thou love god and thyn even erysten and know him. so
much is thy soul / And if thou lytyl love him. lytyl is thy soul / and if
thou naught love him. naught is thy soul / It is naught as for good / but it
is much as for syn^e / and if thou wylt wit what thou love look where upon
thou thynkest / For where the love is there is the eye and where the liking is
there is moosty^ heart thynkyng / If thou love much god ye lyketh for to
thy^ke upon hy^ much / and if thou love lytyl / then^e lytyl thou thynkest
upon him / Rule well thy thoughts and thin affection and then art thou
virtuous /

How the image of sin shall be ^roken down / Capitulum / lxxxix
Begin then on and break this image when thou have Inwardely bethought the of
thyselfe and of thy wrecchydnesse as I have said / how proud. how vain. and
how enuyous / how malencolyous / how covetous / how flesshly / and how full of
corrupcio^ / Also how lytyl knowing felyng or savor thou haast of god / and of
ghostly things / How wise. how quycke / and how much savor thou have i^
erthly things / And shortly that the thinks the also full of syn as ye hyde
is full of flesh Be thou not to much adradde though thou think so of
thyself / And when thou haste done thus lift up then the desire of thy heart to
thy lord Ihesu / and pray him of help / Cry to him by great desires and
syghinges that he will help the to bear this great bourden of this image. or
else that he will break it / Think also such a shame it is for the to be
fed with swynes mete of flesshly savors that should feel a ghostly sauonr of
heavenly Joy If thou do thus / then begynnest thou for to arise ayenste the hole
ground of sin in the as I have said / And it may so be that thou shall feel
pain and sorrow / for thou shall understand that there may no soul live
without great pain but if he have rest or delight either in his creator or in
a creator / Then when thou rysest against thyself by a fervent desire for to
feel of thy lord Ihesu / and for to draw out thy love fro al bodily things /
and fro rest in thy bodily felyng / in so much that thou art encombred of
thyselfe / And the thinks that al creatures risen against the / and al things
which thou had delight in before tourneth ye to pain / And wha^ thou
forsakest thus thyself / and thou may not lightly find comfort in god /
nedelynges thy soul shall suffer pain / Nevertheless I hope who so would
suffer this pain a while steadfastly cleuyng upon ye desire and naked mind of
Ihesu christ / and upon desire yt he would not have but his lord and fall not
lightly therfro / ne seche no comfort outward for a time / for it lastyth not
long / Our lord is nyghe and sone shall ease the heart / For he will help to
bear thy body full of corrupco^n / And he wol with his mercyful might of
gracyous presence break down this false image of love in thyselfe / Not al
atones / but lytyl and lytyl till thou be somdele reformed to his lyckenesse /

AFter such an hole rysyng against thyself when it is passyd. thou shall more

That is to say thus / Thou man of my people they that sayen thou art blessed

besyly thou shall by the grace of Ihu^ within short time stop much of the
spring of pride. and much abate y^ vain delight thereof yt thou shall uneaths

ghostly desire to god for to please him / for to love him. for to know him.
for to see him / and for to have him by grace here in a lytyl feeling. and in

yt which is sin and which is not / and which is good and which is better
good / And if thou wolt festen thy thought thereto it shall teache the al yt the
needs / and it shall get y^ al yt the wants / And therefore when thou shalt
rise against ye ground of sin in general or else in any specyal syn^e hang
fast upon this desire. and set ye point of thy thought more upon god whom
thou desyrest than upon the sin which thou repreuest / For if thou do so
then fyghteth god for y^ / and he shall destroy syne^ in y^. Thou shall much
sooner come to thy purpoos if thou do so than if thou leave thy meke desire to
god pryncypally. and will set thyn heart oonly against ye styryng of syn. as

/ Primum
FOr asmoche as thou couetyst gretely and askyst it for charity for to here
more of an image the which I have before times in party dyscryued to yt /
therefore I will gladly with dread fall to thy desire / and helpyng ye grace of
our lord Ihesu christ. in whom I fully trust. I shall open to the a lytyl more
of this image / At ye beginning if thou wylt wit plainly what I mean by this
image. I tell the forsooth that I understand naught else but thyn own soul
/ For thy soul and my soul and every reasonable soul is an image. Gen^. ^
and yt a worthy image / for it is the image of god as ye apostle says / Uir
est ymago dei / That is to say / A man is the image of god and made to the
image and to the lyknes of him / not i^ the bodily shappe without but in ye
myghtes of it with in as holy writ says. Formauit deus hominem ad ymagine^
and similitudine^ suam / That is / Our lord god shope man i^ his soul ^o his
own image and lyknes This is ye image yt I have spoken of / This image made to
ye image of god in ye fyrst^ hapynge was wo^derly fair and bryghtful of
bre^nyng love and ghostly lyt. but thorough sin of the first man adam it was
dysfygured and for shapen into a another lyknes as I have before said. For it
fell fro yt ghostly light and that heavenly fode in to paynful derknes and lust
of this wretchyd life / exyled and flemyd out fro the heritage of heaven that
it should have had if it had stand stylle into the wretchydnes of this earth:
and afterward in to the prison of hel^e there to have be without end / Fro
the which prison to the heavenly heritage it might never have come again but
if it had be reformed to the first shappe and the first lyckenes. But that
refourmyng might not be made by none erthly man / for every man was in the same
myscheyf / And none might suffyse to help himself and so much less a another
man / Therefore it needs to be done by him that is more than man that is oonly
god / and yt was skillful that he should refourme and restore man to bliss if
he should be saaf / which of his endless goodness first shope him thereto How
then it might be reformed. and how it is reformed to ye first lyckenes by
him yt fourmed it by the grace of god I shall tell the / For yt is the entente
of this writing /

How it neded to mankind yt oonly thorough ye passyo^ of christ it should be
restored and reformed ye was for shape by the first sin / Caplm ii
THe ryghtwysnes of god a sketh yt a trespace done be not foryeuen but if
amends be made for it if it may be done / Now it is sooth. mankind yt was
hole in adam the first man trespassed against god so wonder grievously when it
forfeyted ye specyal bidding of him / and assented to the false counsel of
the fend / that it deserved ryghtfully for to have be departed fro him and
dampened to hell withouten end. so ferforth that stondynge the ryghtwysnes of
god it might not be foryeuen / but if amends were first made and full
satysfaccyon therefore / But this amends might no man make that was man oonly.
and comen out of ada^ by kyndely generacyon for this skylle / For the trespass
and vnworshyp was endless great / and therefore it passyd ma^nys might to make
ame^des for it / And also for his skyl He yt has trespassed and shall make
amends him behouyth for to give to him yt he has trespassed unto all that he
owyth though he had not trespassed / And also over that him behouyth give
so^what that he owyth not but oonly for that he trespassed / But mankind had
not where with that he might pay god for his trespaas over that he ought him \
For what good deed that man might do in body or in soul it was but his debt /
For every man ought as the gospel says for to love god with all his heart and
al his soul and all his myghtes / and better might he not do than this / And
nevertheless this deed suffyced not to the refourmynge of mankind / Ne this
might he not do but if he had be first reformed / Then neded it that if
man's soul should be reformed / and ye trespaas made good / that our lord
god himself should refourme this image / and make amends for this trespaas
sythen that no man might / But that might he not do in his godhede / for he
might not ne ought not to make amends by sufferyng of pain in his own kind
/ therefore it neded the he should take that same mankind that had trespassed
and become man. And that might he not by the common law of generacyon. For it
was impossyble goddis son to be borne of towchyd woman / Therefore him must
become man thoroughe a gracyous generacyon by the werkynge of ye holy ghost of
a clean gracious maiden our lady saint Mary / and so was it done / For our
lord Ihesu gods son became man / and thorugh his precious death that he
suffered made amends to ye fader of heaven for man^es gylte / And ye might he
well do for he was god. and he ought not for himself / but in as much as he
was man borne of ye same kind yt adam was that first trespaced. And so though
he ought it not for his own person / for himself might not sin /
Nevertheless he ought of his free will for the trespaas of mankind / the
which mankind he took for the salvation of man of his endeles mercy For soth
it is. there was never man that might yield to god any thing of his own that
he ought not / but oonly this blessed Ihesu. For he might pay god one thing
that he ought not as for himself / and that was naught but one thing. that
was to give his precious life by wylful taking of death for love of sothfastnes
/ This ought he not / As much good as he might do to y^ worship of god in this
life. al were but debt / But for to take death for love of ryghtwysnesse he
was not bound thereto / He was bound to ryghtwysnesse. but he was not boonde
to deye / for death is oonly a pain ordained to man for his own sin / but
our lord Ihesu sinned never ne he might not sin / and therefore he ought not
for to deye / Then sythen he ought not for to deye* and yet wylfully he deyed
/ then paid he to god more tha^ he ought / And sythen that was the best
man's deed and most worthy that ever was done / Therefore was it reasonable
that the sin of mankind should be foryeuen In as much as mankind had
found a man of ye same kind without wemme of sin / that is Ihesu that might
make amends for the trespaas done and might pay our lord god all that he
ought and over more yt he ought not / Then sith that our lord Ihesu god and
man deyed thus for salvation of man's soul. it is ryghtful yt syn should be
foryeuen / and man^es soul yt was his image should mow be reformed and
restored to the first lyknes and to ye bliss of heaven / This passion of our
lord and this precious death is the ground of al ye refourmyng of al man's
soul / without which might never man's soul have be reformed to the
lyckenesse of him. ne come to the bliss of heaven / But blessed may he be in all
his werkynge / Now is it so that thorough the virtue of his precious passion
the brennyng sword of Cherubyn that drove adam out of paradyce is now put
away. and ye endless gates of heaven arn open to every man that will enter in
thereto / For the person of Ihesu is both god and king of heaven in the bliss
to the fader / and as man he is porter at yt yate ready to receive every soul
yt will be reformed here i^ this life to his lycknes / For now may every soul
if yt he will be reformed to ye likeness of god / sith yt the trespaas is for
yeuen / and the amends thorugh Ihesu is made for the first gylte /
Nevertheless though this be sothe al souls have not the profit ne the fruit nf
this precious passion / ne arne not reformed to ye lyckenes of him /

That the Jews and paynyms and also falls christian men be^ not reformed
effectually thorough the virtue of ye passion for her own defawte Caplm iii
TWo manner of men arne not reformed by the virtue of this passion / One is of
hem yt trow it not / An other is of he^ yt love it not / Jews and paynems
have not the benefyce of his passion / for they trow it not / Jews trow not
yt Ihu^ the sone of ye vyrgyn mary is goddys sone of heaven. Also the paynems
trow not yt the souereyne wisdom of god would become the son of man. and in
manhede would suffer the pains of death / And therefore the Jews held the
prechynge of ye cross and of the passion of christ naught but sclaunder and
blasphemye / and the paynems held it naught but fantome and folly / But true
christian men held it the souereyne wysdom of god and his great might / Thus
said saint poul / Predicamus vobis crystu^ crucifixum jude is quidam scandelu^
gentibus autem stulticiam ip^is aute^ vocatis iudeis and grecis xp^m dei
virtutem et dei sapienciam / co rum. i.
That is we preche to you that ye trow that Ihesu christ crucyfyed the son of
mary is goddis son scuereyne virtue and wysdom of god / the which Ihesu to
Jews and paynems that trow not in him is put sclaunder and folly / And
therefore these men by her untruth putten hemselfe fro the refourmynge of her
own soul / and stondynge her untruth shall they never be saaf ne come to the
bliss of heaven / For sothe it is / fro the beginning of ye world unto the
last endyng was there never man saaf ne shall be ^aaf but if he had troth
general or special in Ihesu christ / to come or I come / For right as al
chosen souls that were before the Incarnacyon under ye old testamente hadden
truth in christ that he should come and refourme man's soul / either openly
as patryarkes and prophets and other holy men had / or else pryuely and
generaly as chyldern and other simple and inperfyte souls hadden that knew
not specially the pryuyte of the Incarnacyon / Right so all chosen souls under
the new testamente has truth in christ that he is come / either openly or
felyngly and ghostly men and wise men have / or else generally as chyldern
have that dyen crystned / and other simple and lewd souls have that arne
nourysshed in the bosom of holy church / Sith this is sothe then thinks me
that these me^ greatly and grievously erren / that sayen that Jews and sarasyns
by keeping of her own law may be made saaf though they trowen not in Ihu^
christ / as holy church trowyth / In as much as they wene y^ her own troth
is good and syker and suffysaunt to her saluaco^n. And in that truth they
done as it semyth many good deeds of ryghtwysnes / And perauenture if they
knew that christian faith were better than her own is / they would leave her
own and take it / therefore yt they should be saaf Nay it is not enough so /
For christ god and man is both way and end / And he is medyatour between god
and man / And without him may no soul be reconsyled / ne come to the bliss
of heaven /

And therefore they that trowen not in him that is both god and man may never
be saaf ne come to bliss / Other men also that louen not christ nor his
passion arne not reformed in the soul to the lyckenes of him And these men
arne false christian men the which arne out of charity / and lyuen and deyen in
dedely sin / These men trowen well as it semyth that Ihesu is goddis son / And
that his passion suffyseth to saluaco^n of man's soul / And they trow also
all the other artycles of the faith / But it is an vushaply truth and a
deed: for they love him not ne they chese not the fruit of his passion / but
they lain stylle in her sin and in the false love of this world unto her
last end / And so they ben not refonrmed to the lyckenesse of god. but goon
to the pains of hell endelesly. as Jews and sarasyns done and in to much
more gretter pain than they / In as much as they had ye truth and kept it
not / For that was more trespaas than that they had never had it / Then if
thou wolte wit which souls arne reformed here in this life to the image of
god thoroughe the virtue of his passion / soothly oonly those that trowen in
him / and louen him / in which souls the image of god that was thorough sin
forshapen \ as it were in to a foul bestes lyckenes is restored and reformed
to ye first shape / and to the worthynes and worship that it had in the
beginning / Without which restorynge and refourmynge shall never soul be
faaf ne come to bliss /

Of two manner refourmynges of this image / one i^ fulness another in faith /
Capl'm iiii
NOw say thou how may this be soth that the image of god. the which is
man's soul might be refourmyd here in this life to his lyckenesse in any
creature / It semyth nay. it might not be so / For if it were reformed then
should it have stable mind / clear sight and clear brennynge love in god and
ghostly things euerlastyngly as it had in the beginning / But yt is no
creature as thou trowest living here in this life / For as against thyself thou
can well say the think the full far therfro / Thy mind thy reason and ye
love of thy soul arne so much set in beholding and i^ love of erthly
things / that of ghostly things thou felyst right lytyl Thou felyst no
refourmynge in thyselfe / but thou art so vnbylapped with this black image of
sin for ought yt thou may do / that upon what side thou the tour ne thou
felyst thyself defoyled and spotted with flesshly styrynges of this foul
image: other chau^gyng felyst thou none fro flesshlynes into ghostlynesse
neither in pryue myghtes of thy soul with in ne in bodily feeling with out /
Wherefore ye thynken that it might not be yt this image might be reformed / Or
else if it might be reformed / Then ask thou how it might be reformed /
To this I answer and lay thus. There is two manner of refourmyng of the image
of god which is man's soul / One is in fullness / A another is in party /
Refourmynge in fullness may not be had in this life / but it is delayed after
this life to ye blys^e of heaven / where man's soul shall fully be reformed.
not to that state that it had at the first beginning by kind. or might have
had thorough grace if it had stand hole / But it shall be restored to much
more bliss and much hyer Joy thorough the great mercy and the endless
goodness of god than it should have had if it had never fallen / For then shall
the soul receive the hole and ye full felyng of god in all mightes of it.
without medelyng of any other affection / And it shall see mankind in the
person of Ihesu above ye kind of angels onyd to the godhede / For then shall
Ihu^ both god and man be al in all / and oonly he. Isay. ^
and none other but he as ye prophet says / Dominus solus exaltabitur in illa
die. That is our lord Ihesu in that day yt is everlasting day shall be hyghed
oonly. and none but he / And also ye body of man shall then be gloryfyed / For
it shall receive fully the rich dowary of vndedelynes with all yt longs
thereto / This shall a soul have with ye body / and much more than I can say.
But that shall be in the bliss of heaven and not in this life. For though it be
so yt the passyo^ of our lord be cause of all this full refourmynge of man's
soul / nevertheless it was not his will for to grant this full refourmynge
right anon after his passion to al chosen souls that were living in time of
his passion / But he delayed it unto the last day And that was for this
skylle / Sooth it is yt our lord Ihesu Christ of his mercy has ordained a
certain number of souls to salu^cyo^ which number was not fulfilled in the
time of his passion / And therefore it neded that by length of time thorough
kyndly generyon of men it should be fulfilled / Then if it had so be that as
sone after the death of our lord every soul that would have trowed in him
should by his life have be blessed and full reformed without any other abiding
/ there would no creature that lived then have be that he ne would have
received ye faith for to have be made blessed / And then should generacyon
have ceased. And so should we that arne now chosen souled living and other
souls that come after us not have been borne / And so should our lord have
fayles of his number / But that may not be / And therefore our lord purueyed
much better for us in that that he delayed the full refourmyng of man's soul
till the last end. as saint poul says / Deo pro nobis melius prouidente. De^
br.
ne sieve nobis consu^marentur / That is. Our lord purueyeth better for us in
the delay of our refourmynge than if he had granted it then / For this
skylle that the chosen souls here beforne should not make a full end without
us that come after / A another skylle is this / For sith that man in his first
fourmynge of god was set in his free will and had free chesynge whether he
would have fully god or no. It was therefore reasonable that sith he would not
che^e god then but wretchydly fell from him / If he should afterward be
reformed that he should be set again in the same free chesynge that he was
first in / whether he would have ye profit of his refourmynge or no / And this
may be a skylle why man's soul was not reformed fully as fast after the
passion of Ihesu christ /

That refourmyng in party is i^ two manners. one in faith another in feeling /
Caplm^ v.
ANother refourmynge of this image is in party: and this refourmynge may be
had in this life: and but if he had in this life it may never be had. ne the
soul may never be saaf / But this refourmynge is on two manners / One is in
faith oonly. A another is in faith and in feeling. The first refourmynge in
faith oonly suffyseth to salvation / The second is worthy to have passing
mede in the bliss of heaven / The first may be had lightly and in short
time / The second may not so but thoroughe length of time and much ghostly
traueyle / The first may be had with the feeling of the image of sin /
for though a man feel no thing in himself but all styrynges of sin and
flesshly desires. not ayenstondynge that feeling / if he wylfully assent not
thereto he may be reformed in faith to the lyckenesse of god / But the second
refourmynge puttyth out the liking in feeling of flesshly styrynges and
worldly desires / and suffers no such spots abide in this image / The
first refourmynge is oonly of begyn^ynge and profytynge souls. and of
actyfmen / The second is of perfyte souls and of contemplatyfmen. For by the
first refourmynge the image of sin is not destroyed. but it is left as it
were all hole in feeling / But the second refourmynge destroys the old
felynges of this image of sin / and brings in to the soul new gracyous
felynges thoroughe the werkynge of the holy ghost / The first is good. the
second is better / but the third that is in the bliss of heaven is most
best / First let us speak of that one and sithe of that other / And so we
shall come to the third /

That thorough the sacrament of baptym yt is grounded in the passion of christ
this image is reformed fro orygynal sin / Caplm^ vi
TWo manner of sins makyth a so^le to lose ye shape and the lyknesse of god.
That one is called orygynal yt is ye first syn. the other is called actuel yt is
wylfully done syn. thise ii. sins put away a soul fro ye bliss of heaven.
and da^pneth it to the^dles pain of hell. but if it be thorough the grace of god
refourmyd to his lyckenesse or it pass hens out of this life / Nevertheless two
remedies arne there against these two sins / by yt which a forshapen soul
may be restored again / One is ye sacrament of baptym ayenste orygynal sin
/ a another is the sacrament of penance against actuel syn^e / A soul of a
child that is borne and is vncrystenyd by cause of orygynal sin has no
lyckenesse of god / He is naught but an image of the fend and a bronde of
hell. But as soon as it is crystened it is reformed to the image of god /
and thorugh the virtue of faith of holy church suddenly it is turned fro the
lyckenesse of ye fend and made like an angel of heaven. Also ye same falls to
a Jew or to a sarazyne the which or they ben crystened arne naught but
mancyples of hell / But when they forsaken her error and fallen mekely to the
truth in christ and receive the baptym of water in the holy sthost. sothly
without any more taryenge they arne reformed to the lyckenesse of god so
fully as holy church troweth. that if they might as soon after baptym pass
out of this world. they should straight flee to heaven without any more
lettyng / had they done never so much sin before in the time of her
untruth / and never should they feel the pains of hell ne of purgatory /
And ye pryuelege should they have by the merit of crystis passion /

That thorough the sacrament of penance ye stondeth in contrycyon confession
and satysfaccyon this image is reformed fro actual sin / Caplm^ vii
ALso what christian man or woman yt has lost ye lyckenesse of god thoroughe a
dedely sin brekynge goddis commandments / if he thoroughe to wchynge of
grace sothfastly forsake his sin with sorrow and contricyon of heart. and be
in full will for to amend him / and torn him to good living / And in this
foresaid will receives the sacrament of penance if he may / Or if that he
may not he is in wyltherto. Sothly I say that this man's soul or woman's yt
was forshapen first to the lyknesse of the devil thorough dedely sin is now
by the sacrament of penance restored and shapen again to the image of our lord
god This is a great curtesye of our lord and an endless mercy that so lightly
foryeuyth al manner of sin / and so suddenly yeuyth plente of grace to a
synful soul that askyth mercy of him / He abides not great penance doing ne
paynful flesshly sufferyng or he foryeue it / But he askyth a lothynge of sin
and a full forsakynge in will of the soul for the love of him and a tournyng of
ye heart to him / This askyth he / for this yeuyth he / And then^e when he sees
this without any delayenge. he foryeuyth the sin and refourmyth the soul to
his lyknesse / The sin is foryeuen that the soul shall not be dampened /
Nevertheless the pain detted for the sin is not yet fully foryeuen / but if
contrycyon and love be the more And therefore shall he go and show him and
shriue him to his ghostly rader. and receive penance enjoined for his
trespaas. and gladly fulfill it. so that both the sin and ye pain may be
done away or he pass hens / And that is the skillful ordinance of holy
church for great profit of man's soul that though the sin be foryeuen
thorough the virtue of contrycyon / nevertheless in fulfyllynge of meekness:
and for to make hole satysfaccyon he shall if he may show to his priest plener
confessyo^ for yt is his token and his warraunt of foryeuenesse ayenste al his
enmyes. and yt is needful for to have / For if a man had forfeyted his life
against a king of this earth it were not enough to him as for a fulsykernesse
for to have only foryeuenesse of the king / but if he have a charter the
which may be his token and his warraunt against al other men / Right so may
it be said ghostly / If a man have forfeyted against the king of heaven his
life thorough dedely sin / It is not enough to him to fulsykernesse for to
have foryeuenes of god oonly by contrycyon between god and him. but if he have
a charter made by holy church if he may come thereto And that is the sacrament
of penance the which is his charter and his token of foryeuenes / For sith
that he forfeyted both ayenste god and holy church it is skillful that he have
foryeuenesse for that one and a warrant for ye other / And this oo skylle why
that confession is nedeful / A another skylle is this / For sith this refourmyng
of the soul stondyth in faith oonly and not in felyng / therefore a flesshly
man that is rude and boystouse and can not deem lightly but outward of bodily
things should not mow have crowyd yt his sins had been foryeue^ him but if he
had some bodily token. and that is confession thorough the which token he is
made ^ll syker of foryeuenes if yt he do that in him is / This is the troth of
holy church as I understand it / Also a another skylle is this / Though the
ground of foryeuenesse stand not pryncypally in confession but in contrycyon
of ye heart. and in forthyn king of sin / nevertheless I hope that there is
many a soul that should never a felyd very contricyo^. nor had full forsakynge
of sin if confession had not be / For it fallyth often sythes that in the time
of coufessyon grace of compunccyon comyth to a soul that before never felyd
grace. but ever was cold and dry and ferder fro felyng of grace / And
therefore sith confession was so profitable to the more party of christian men
holy church ordained for the more sykernesse generally to al cryste^ men that
every man and woman should ones in the year at the lest be shryuen of all her
sins that come to her mind to her ghostly fader. though they had never so
much contrycyon before time / Nevertheless I hope well that if al men had been as
besye about the keeping of themself in eschewynge of almaner of sin / And
had common to as much great knowing and felyng of god as some man has / That
holy church should not have ordained the token of confession. as for nedeful
bond for it had not neded / But for all men arne not so perfyte. and
perauenture much of the more party of christian men is imperfect. therefore holy
church ordained confession. by way of general bond to al christian men that
will know holy church as her mother. and wol be buxome to her bidding / If
this be soth as I hope it is then erreth he gretely that generally says that
confession of sins for to show a priest is neither nedeful to a sinner ne
behoful / and that no man is bound thereto / For by that that I have said it is
both nedeful and spedful to al souls that in this wretchyd life are defoyled /
thorough sin / and namely to those yt arne thorough dedely sin forshapen
fro the lyknes of god which mye not be reformed to his likeness but by the
sacrament of penance that pryncypally stondeth in contrycyon and sorrow of
heart / and secundary in shryfte of mouth following after if it may be had
/ Upon this mauere by this sacrament of penance is a synful soul reformed to
the image of god and to his lyckenesse /

How in the sacrament of baptym and of penance thorough a preuy vnperceyuable
worchynge of the holy ghost this image is reformed though it be not seen ne
felt / Calpm^ viii
BUT this refourmange stondeth in faith and not in felyng / For right as the
propyrte of the faith is for to trow yt thou see not. right so it is for to
trow ye thou felyst not. But he yt is reformed in his soul by ye sacrament
of penance to ye image of god he felyth no chau^gynge in himself neither in
his bodily kind without ne in the pryue substance of the soul within other
than he did. for he is as he was unto his feeling / and he felyth the same
styrynges of sin and the same corrupcyon of his flesh in passions and
worldly rysynge in his heart as he did before / And nevertheless he shall trow
yt he is thorugh grace reformed to ye lyknes of god though he another feel it
ne see it / He may well feel sorrow for his sin and a tornyng of his will fro
syn^e to cle^nesse of living if yt he have grace and take good keep of
himself but he may another see ne feel the refourmyng of his soul how it is
wonderly and vnperceyuably changed fro ye fylthe of the fend unto the fayrnes
of an angel thorough a pryue gracyous werchyng of the holy ghost. That may he
not see but he shall trow it / And if he trow it. then is his soul reformed
in truth. For right as holy church trowith by ye sacrament of baptym
sothfastly received a Jew or a sarasyn or a child borne is reformed in soul
to the lyckenesse of god thorough a pryue vnperceyuable werthyng of the holy
ghost / not aye^ sto^dyng al ye flesshly styrynges of his body of syn. ye
which he shall feel after his baptim as well as he did before Right so by ye
sacrament of penance mekely and truly reco^maundement of god / And for that
thou haste mysdone here before ayenste his byddyng thou have shryuen y^ thereof
mekely with full heart to leave it / and art sorry that thou dydest it / I say
then sykerly that thy soul is reformed in faith to the lyknes of god /

That all the souls that lyuen mekely in the faith of holy church / and have
her faith quyckened in love and chary ben reformed by this sacrament / though
it be so ye they may not feel y^ specyal yefte of deuoco^n or of ghostly
feeling / Calpm^ x
IN this refourmynge that is oonly in faith ye most part of chosen souls
leden her life that sette^ her will steadfastly for to flee al manner of dedely
sin / and for to keep hem in love and charity to her even cryste^ and for to
keep the commandments of god after her cu^nynge / And when it so is that
wicked styrynges and evil wylles risen in her hertes of pride or of envy of
ire or lecherye / or of any other head sin they ayenstonde he^ and stryuen
against hem by dysplesyng of will / so that they follow not in deed these wicked
wylles / And nevertheless if they fall lightly as it were against her will
thorugh freelte or vncu^nynge / as soon her conscience greuyth hem and pynyth
hem so grievously that they mow have no rest till they be shryuen and may
have foryeuenesse / Sothly al these souls that thus lyuenin this refourmynge
and ben found therein. In the hour of death they shall be saaf / and come to
the full refourmynge in the bliss of heaven / Though it be so that they
might never have ghostly feeling ne Inward sauoure. ne special grace of
devotion in all her life time / For else if thou say that no soul shall be
^aaf but it were reformed in ghostly felyng that it might feel devotion and
ghostly savor in god as some souls done thorough specyal grace. then should
few souls be saaf in reward of multitude of other / Nay it is not for to
trow that ye for the souls that oonly arne devout. and by grace come to
ghostly feeling. and for no mo our lord Ihu^ should have take mankind / and
suffered ye hard passion of death. It had be a lytyl purchaas to him for to
have come fro so far to so nere / and fro so hye to so low for so few
souls Nay his mercy is spread larger than so / Nevertheless on the contrary
wise if thou trow yt the passion of our lord is so precious. and his mercy
so much yt there shall no soul be dampened. and namely of no christian man do he
never so evil as some fools wene. sothly thou e^rest greatly / Therefore go in
ye mean and hold the in ye mids. and trow as holy church trowith / And
that is that the most synful man yt lives in there if he torn his will
thorough grace fro dedely sin with sothfaste repentance to the service of
god / he is reformed in his soul / And if he deyed in ye state he shall be
saaf / Thus behyght our lord by his prophet saying thus / In quacu^que hora
conuersus fuerit peccator and ingemuerit. E. xx viii
vita viuit and no^ morietur / That is / In what time that it be that the
synful man is turned to god fro sin and he have sorrow therefore he shall live.
and he shall deye endelesly / And on the other side who so lyuyth in dedely
sin and will not leave it ne amend him thereof: ne receive the sacrament of
penance / or else if he receive it he takyth it not sothfastly for the love
of god / that is for the love of virtue and clennesse but oonly for dread or
shame of the world / or for dread only of pains of hell / he is not
reformed to the lyknesse of ceyued a falls christian man yt has been enco^bred
with dedely syn al his life time is reformed i^ his soul within
vnperceyuably. out taken a tournyng of his will thorough a pryue might and a
gracyous werchyng of ye holy ghost yt suddenly werchyth / and in time of a
monent or a twynkelynge of an eye ryghtyth a froward soul. and tourneth it
fro ghostly fylth to fayrnes vnseable / and of a servant of ye fend makyth a
son of Joy / and of ye prisoner of hell makyth a perceyuer of heavenly
heritage not aye^sto^dyng al ye flesshly felyng of this synful image yt is ye
bodily kind / For thou shall understood yt ye sacrament of baptym or of
penance is not of yt virtue for to let and destroy utterly al ye styrynges of
flesshly lusts and paynful passions yt a man's soul never feel no manner
rysyng ne styrynges of he^ no time / For if it were so then were a soul fully
reformed here to ye worship of ye first making. But yt may not be fully i^
this life But it is of ye virtue yt it cle^seth soul fro all the sins before
done / And if it be departed fro ye body sauyth it fro da^pnacyon. And if it
dwell in ye body it yeuyth ye soul grace to ayensto^de ye styrynges of syn /
and it kepyth it in grace also yt no manner of lusty styrynges or of passions yt
it felyth in ye flesh be it never so grievous shall dear it ne depart it fro
god aslo^ge as it wylfully senteth not thereto / Thus saint poul meaned wha^ he
said thus / Nichil da^pnaco^nis in htis q^ no^ scdm carne^ ambulant / That is.
To. viiii
These souls yt arn reformed to ye image of god in feyth thorugh the
sacrament of baptym or of penance shall not be dampened for felynges of this
image of syn^e / if it so be yt they go not after ye styryuges of ye flesh by
deed doing /

That we should believe steadfastly refourmynge of this image. if our conscience
wytnes to us a full forsakyng of sin. and a true tornyng of our will to good
living. Ca. ix
OF this refourmynge in faith spekyth saint poul thus. Hebr^. x
Iustus ex fide viuit / The ryghtwysman lives in faith. That is. He that is
made ryghtful by baptym or by penance he lives in faith / which suffyseth
unto saluacyo^ and to heavenly pees as saint poul says / Iustificati ex fide
pace^ habemus ad deu^ / That is: To. v.
we yt arn ryghted and reformed thorugh faith in christ has pees and accord
made betwyx god and us. naught ayenstondyng yt vycyous felynges of our body of
syn / For though this refourmyng be pryue and may not well be felt here in
this life / nevertheless who so trowyth it steadfastly. and shapyth his works
bysely for to accord to his troth and yt he turn not again to dedely syn^e.
Soothly when y^ hour of death comyth. and the soul is departed fro this bodyly
life then shall he find it sooth yt I say now / Thus said saint John^ in
comfort of chosen souls yt lyuen here i^ faith under ye felyng of this
paynful image / Karissimi. and nunc sumus filii dei: sed non du^ aparuit quod
erimus / Scimus aute^ qm^ cu^ cristus apparuit tunt apparebimus cum eo similes
et in gloria / That is: My dear friends we arn now while we live here ye sons
of god for we arn reformed by faith in christ to his lyckenes But it shewyth
not yet what we arn / but it is al pryue / Nevertheless we know well yt wha^ our
lord shall show him at the last day / then shall we appear with him like unto
him in endless Joy / If thou wolte wit then^e if thy soul be reformed to the
image of god or no / by yt I have said thou may have entree / Ransake thy
conscience. and look what thy will is / For there in stondeth al If it be
turned fro al manner of dedely sin. that thou would for no thing wyttyngly
and wylfully break y^ to / And therefore him needs ever be striuyng and
fighting against wicked styrynges of this image of sin / and yt he make none
accord therewith / ne take no frendshyp to it for to be buxum to his vnskylful
biddynges / For if he do he begyleth himself / But soothly if he stryueth with
hem him needs not much dread of assenting / For strife brekyth pees and falls
accord. It is good that a man have pees with all thing sauf with ye fend and
with this image of sin / for ayenste hem him needs ever fight in his
thought and in his deed till he have geten on hem the maystry. and yt shall
never be fully in this life / as long as he hereth and felyth this image / I
say not but y^ a soul may thornghe grace have the hyer hand over this image
so ferforthe yt he shall not follow ne sent to the vnskylful styrynges of it /
But for to be so clean delyuerde fro this image that he should feel no
suggestyon ne Ianglyng of flesshly affection ne of vain thought no time may
no man have in this life / I hope yt a soul that is reformed in feeling by
rauysshynge of love in contemplacyon of god may be so far fro the sensualyte
and fro vain ymagynacyon and so far drawn out and depart fro the flesshly
feeling for a time that it shall not feel but god / but that lasts not ever /
And therefore say I that every man behouyth stryffe against this image of sin
/ and namely he that is reformed in faith oonly that so lightly may be
dysceyued therewith / In ye person of which me^ says saint poul / Caro
concupiscit aduersus spiritu^ and spu^s aduersus carne^. Gal. v
That is: A soul reformed to ye lyknes of god fyghtyth against yt flesshly
styrynges of this image of sin / and also this image of sin stryueth against
the will of the spyryte. This manner of fyghtyng of this dowble image saint
poule knew wha^ he said thus / Inueni legem in membris meis repugnante^ legi
me^tis me and capitiuum meducente^ in legem peccati / That is / I have found
two laws in myself / One law in my soul within / and another in my flesshly
lym^es without fyghtyng with it yt often ledeth me as a wretchyd prisoner to ye
law of syn By these two laws in a soul I understand this double image / To.
vii
By the law of the spyryte I understand y^ reason of the soul when it is
reformed to ye image of god / By the law of the flesh I understand ye
sensualytees which I call y^ image of sin / In these two laws a soul
reformed ledeth his life as saint poul says / Me^te enim seruio legi dei.
carne enim legi peccati / In my soul that is in my will and in my reason I
serve to the law of god / but in my flessh yt is i^ my flesshly appetyte I
serve to the law of sin / Nevertheless yt a soul reformed shall not dispeyre
though he serve to the law of sin by feeling of the vycyous sensualyte
ayenste the will of the spyryte by cause of corrupcyon of the bodily kind.
Saint poul excusyth it saying thus of his own person / To. vii
Non eni^ quod volo bonu^ hoc ago sed malum quod odi hoc facio. Si aute^ malu^
quod odi hoc facio. no^ ego operor illud sed quod habitat i^ me peccatu^ / I do
not that good yt I would do. That is I would feel no flesshly styryng / and
that do I not / But I do that evil yt I hate. That is. The synful styryng of
my flesh I hate / and yet I feel hem / Nevertheless sith it is so yt I have ye
wicked styrynges of my flesh / and yet I feel hem and often delight in hem
against my will they shall not be reherced ayenste me fro dampnacyon as if I had
done hem / And why / For the corrupcyon of this image of sin does hem. and
not I. Loo saint poul in his person god / And if he deye in yt plyght he shall
not be saaf / His troth shall not save him / for his troth is deed and lackyth
love. and therefore it seruyth him not / But they that have troth quyckened
with love and charity arn reformed to the lyckenesse of god. though it be but
the leest degree of charity. as arn simple souls ye which felen not ye yeft of
specyal devotion ne ghostly knowing of god as some ghostly men done. but trowen
generally as holy church trowyth. and knowyth not fully what yt is. for it
needs not to hem. And in that trowyth they keep hem in love and charytee to
her even christian as they may / and fleen al dedely sin after her cu^nynge /
and dooen ye deeds of mercy to her even christian / Al these longen to the bliss
of heaven / For it is written in the apoc. Apoc. icon.
thus. Qui timetis deum pusilli et magni lau^ate eum. This is / ye that dreden
god both small and great thank him. By great arn understood souls yt arne
profytyng in grace or else perfyte in ye love of god. the which arn refourmyd
in ghostly feeling: By ^male arn understood souls imperfect of worldly men
and wymmen. and other that have but a chyldys knowing of god and full lytyl
feeling of him. but arn brought forth in the bosom of holy church and
nourysshed with the sacrament as chylderne arn fed with milk / Al these
should love god and thank him for salvation of her souls by his endless mercy
and goodness / For holy church that is mother of al these and has tender love
to al her chylderne ghostly prays and asks for hem al tenderly of her
spowse that is Ihesu and geteth hem hele of soul thorough virtue of his
passion And namly for hem that can not speak for hemselfe by ghostly prayer for
her need / Thus I find in the gospel That y^ woman of Chanee asked of our
lord hele to her daughter that was traueyled with a fend / and our lord made
first daungeour by cause she was an alyene / Nevertheless she ceased not for to
cry till our lord had granted her askyng. and said to her thus. Aa woman much
is thy troth be it to ye right as thou wolt / In the same hour was her
daughter hole / This woman betokenith holy church y^ asks help of our lord
for simple vncu^nynge souls that are traueyled with te^ptacyon of ye world /
and can not speak perfytly to god by fervor of deuoco^n ne brennyng love in
conte^placyon / And though it seem that our lord make dau^geour first by
cause that they arn as it were alyened fro him / nevertheless for the great
truth and dyserte of holy church he grants to her al yt she will / And so
arn these simple souls yt trowen steadfastly as holy church trowyth / and
putten hem fully in ye mercy of god / and maken hem under the sacrament and
laws of holy church made saaf thorugh prayer and troth of her mother holy
church /

That souls reformed neden ever to fight and to strive ayenste the styrynges
of sin while they lyuen here And how a soul may know when it assentyth to
ye styrynge. and when not / Caplm^ xi.
THis refourmyng in faith is lightly gotten / but it may not so lightly behold
/ and therefore what man or woman yt is reformed to the lyekenesse of god in
troth much traueyle and business must they have if they will keep this image
hole and clean yt it fall not down again thorugh wekenesse of will to the image
of syn^e He may not be idle ne reklees for ye image of sin is so nere
festnyd to him / and so contynually pressyth upon him by diverse styrynges of
syn / that but if he be right well waar he shall full lightly thorugh assent fall
aye^ there comfort al souls that thorough grace arne reformed in faith y^
they sholden not tomoche dread ye bourden of this image with the vnskylful
styrynges thereof if it so be they sent not wylfully thereto / Nevertheless in
this point many souls y^ arne reformed in truth arne often times much
tormented and trowbled in vain as thus / When they have felt flesshly
styrynges of pride or envy of couetyse or lechery or of any other he desyn^e.
they wot not sometime whether they sent thereto or no. and that is no great
wonder / For in time of temptacyon a freel man's thought is so trowbled and so
over laid yt he has no clear sight ne fredom of himself / but is taken often
with lykyng unwarily. and gooth forth a great while or then he perceive it / And
therefore fallen some in dowte and dwere wheder they syn^ed in time of
te^ptacyon or no / As against this point I say as me think / yt a soul may
have assayeng in this manner whed yt he assente or no / If it be so yt a man is
styred to any manner of sin. and the liking is so great in his flesshly
feeling yt it trowblyth his reason. and as it were with maystry ocupyeth the
affecco^n of ye soul / nevertheless he kepyth him yt he follows not in deed /
ne he would not if he might but is rather paynful to him for to feel the lykyng
of ye sin. and feign he would put it away if he might / And then when ye
styryng is ouerpassed he is glad and well paid yt he is delivered of it / by
this assay may he wit. yt were the lykyng never so great in the flesshly
feeling yt he assented not ne sinned not namly dedely. Nevertheless a remedy
there is syker to such a simple soul yt is marred in itself and can not help
it yt he be not to bold in himself utterly wenynge y^ such flesshly styryng
with lykyng are no syn^eh. for he might so fall in to rechelesnes and into
falls sekernes. Ne also yt he be not to dredeful ne to simple in wit for to
deem hem al as dedely sin nor as great venyals for another is soth. but yt he
hold he^ al as sins and wretchydnes of himself. and that he have sorrow for
he^ and be not to besy for to deem hem another dedely ne venyall. But if his
conscience be greatly grieved y^ he hastily go and show to his confessor in
general or in specyal such styrynges. and namly every styrynge ye begins to
festen any rote in ye heart and most ocupyeth it for to draw it down to
sin and worldly vanytee / And then when he is thus shryuen generally or
specially trow then steadfastly y^ they ben foryeuen. and dyspute no more about
hem that arne passed and foryeuen whether they were dedely or venyal. But yt he
be more besy to keep him better against hem that arne coming And if he do thus
then may he come to rest in conscience But then some arn so flesshly and so
vncu^nyng that they would feel or see or here foryeuenes of her sins as
openly as they might feel and see a bodily thing / And for as much as they
feel it not so therefore they fall often in such weeres and doubts of himself
and never may come to rest / and in that arne they unwise. for faith gooth
before felyng / Our lord said to a man that was in ye palsye when he helyd him
thus / Co^fide sili remiremittu^^ tibi pcca^ tua. M. ix.
That is: Sone trow steadfastly thy sins arn foryeuen y^ / He said not to him
se or feel how thy sins arne foryeue y^ / for ye foryeuenes of sins is done
ghostly and vnseable thorough the grace of ye holy ghost. but trow it Right on
the same wise. every man that will come to rest in conscience him behouyth
first if he do y^ in him is trow without ghostly feeling foryeuenes of his
sins / And if he first trow it / he shall afterward thorough grace feel it.
and understand if it is so. Thus says the apostle / Nisi crederitis no^
intellegitis / That is. Isay. vii.
But if ye first trow ye may not understand / Troth gooth before and
understanding comyth after / the which understanding that I call the light
of god if it be gracyous a soul may not have but thorough great clennesse. M.
v.
as our lord says / Beati mundo cord qm^ ip^i deum videbunt / Blessed be
clean of heart for they shall see god. not with her flesshly eye but with the
Inner eye that is understanding cleansed and lyghted thorough grace of the holy
ghost for to se sothfastnes. ye which clennes a soul may not feel but if he
have stable troth going before as thapostle says / Fide mundans corda eorum.
Act. xv
That is our lord cleanses ye hertes of his chosen thoroughe faith / therefore
it is nedful yt a soul trow first the refourmynge of himself made thorough
the sacrament of penance though he see it not / And that he dyspose himself
fully for to live ryghtfully and virtuously as his tronth askyth / so that he
may after come to sight and to the refourmynge in feeling /

That this image is both fair and foul whiles it is in this life here though
it be reformed / And of dyuersyte of felynges pryuely had between these souls
that been reformed and other yt ben not / Caplm^ xii
Fair is man's soul. and foul is a man's soul Fair in as much as it is
reformed in faith to ye lyckenes of god / But it is foul in as much as it is
medlyd with flesshly felynges and vnskylful styrynges ofth image of syn / Foul
without as it were a be / fair within like to an a^gel / Foul in felyng of
the sensualyte fair in troth of the reason / Foul for the flesshly appetyte.
fair for the good will / Thus fair and thus foul is a chosen soul / saying
holy writ thus / Nigra su^ sed formosa filie Ierlm sicut tabernacula cedar et
sicut pellis salomonis / That is. Cant. i
I am black but I am fair and shaply ye daughter of Ihr^lm as ye tabernacles
of cedar as the skin of solomon / That is ye angels of heaven y^ arne
daughters of the hye Ier^lm wonder not on mean despise me not for my black
shadow / For though I be black without by cause of my flesshly kind as is a
tabernacle of cedar / Nevertheless I am full fair with in as the skin of
solomon. for I am reformed to the lyckenes of god / By cedar is understood a
reproved soul the which is a tabernacle of the devil / By solomon is
understood our lord Ihesu. For he is pees and peasyble By the skin of
solomon is understand a blessed anget in whom our lorded wellyth / And is
hid as is the life hid in the skyn^e of a quycke body / And therefore is an
aungel lyckened to a skin Then may a chosen soul with meke trust in god
and gladenes of heart say thus. Though I be black by cause of my body of
sin as a reproved soul that is one of the tabernacles of the fend /
nevertheless I am within full fair thoroughe truth and good will like to an
angel of heaven / For so says he in a another place / Nolite considerare me quoth
fusca su^. Cant. i
qm^ decolorauit me sol. That is. Behold me not that I am swart for y^ son
has defaded me / The son makyth askynne swarte oonly without and not within
/ and it betokenith this flesshly life / Therefore says a chosen soul thus /
Repreue me not for I am swart for the swartnesse y^ I have is al without of
towchynge and of berynge of this image of sin / but it is no thing within /
And therefore soothly though it be so yt a chosen soul reformed in faith
dwell in this body of sin and feel the same flesshly styrynges / and use y^
same bodily works as does a tabernacle of cedar so ferforth y^ in man's dome
there should no dyfference be bytwyx yt one and that other. Nevertheless within
in her souls there is a full great deuersyte. and in the sight of god there is
full much twynnynge / But the knowing of this which is one and which is
other oonly kept to god. for it passes man's dome and man's feeling / and
therefore we shall no man deem as evil for that thing that may be used both
evil and well. A soul that is not reformed is take so fully with the love of
the world / and so much ouerlayed with the liking of his flesh in all his
sensualyte that he chesyth it as a full rest of his heart. and in his pryue
meaning he would not else have but yt he might ever be syker thereof. He
felyth no lycour of grace styryng him for to loathe his flesshly life ne for to
desire heavenly bliss / And therefore I may say that he bears not this image
of syn^e / but he is borne of it as a man that were seek and so weyke that he
might not bear himself / And therefore he is laid in a bed and borne in a
lytere / Right so such a synful soul is so weyke and so vnmyghty for lacking
of grace that he may neither meue hand ne foot for to do ouy good deed: ne
for to ayenstonde by dysplesynge of will the leest styryng of sin when it
comyth / but it falls down thereto as it were a be upon careyne / But a
soul that is reformed though he use his flesshly wits / and feel flesshly
styrynges / nevertheless he lotheth hem in his heart. for he would for no thing
fully rest in hem / but he flees the rest as the byttynge of an adder / and
had lever have his rest and y^ love of his heart in god if yt he cowde. and
sometime desires thereto / and often grutcheth of the liking of this life for
love of the life everlasting / This soul is not borne in this image of sin
as a seek man though he feel it. but he beryth it / For thorugh grace he is
made mighty and strong for to suffer and bear his body with all the evil
styringes of it without hurtynge or defoylynge of himself / and y^ is in
asmoche as he loves hem not. ne follows he^ not ne senteth not to hem the
which arne dedely sins as a another does / This was bodily fulfilled in y^
gospel of a man y^ was in the palsye. and was so feeble y^ he might not go /
and therefore was he laid and borne in a lytere and brought to our lord / And
when our lord saw him in myscheyf of his goodness he said to him / Surge et
toll grabatum tuu^ et vade in domum cua^ / That is: Ioh. i.
Rise up and take thy bed and go in to thy house / And so he did. and was
hole. And sothly right as this man bare upon his back when he was made hole
the bed that before bare him / Right so it may be said ghostly that a soul
reformed in faith beryth this image of sin the which bare him before / And
therefore be not adradde to much of thy blackenesse that thou haste of berynge
of this image of sin / But as ayenste ye shame and the dyscomforte that thou
haste of beholding of it and also again vpbraydynge that thou felyst in thy heart
of the ghostly enmyes when they said to the thus / where is thy lord Ihesus.
what sekest thou / where is ye fayrnes y^ thou spekest of. what felyst thou
ought but blyndnes of sin / where is that image of god that thou say is
reformed in the Comfort thyselfe and be faithful styfly as I have before said
/ And if thou do so thou shall by this troth destroy all the temptacyons of
thin enmyes / Thus said the apostle poul / Accipe scutum fidei in quo omnia
tela hostis nequissima poteris extinguere / That is: Ephesians. con
Take to the ashelde of steadfast troth thorugh the which thou may quench
all the brennynge darts of thyn enmye /

Of three manner of men of ye which some ben not reformed / and some ben
reformed only in faith / and some in faith and in feeling / Caplm^ xiii
BY this that I have said may thou see that after diverse parties of the soul
arn diverse states of men / Some men arn not reformed to the likeness of god /
and some arne reformed to the lyckenesse of god / And some arn reformed only
in faith / and some arne reformed in faith and in feeling / For thou shall
under stand yt a soul has two parties / That one is called sensualyte and
that is flesshly feeling by the five outward wits / the which is common to
man and to be / Of the which sensualyte when it is vnskylfully and
vnordynatly ruled is made the image of sin / when it is not ruled after
reason / for then is the sensualyte syn^e That other party is called reason
/ and that is departed in two / In the over party and in y^ nether / The over
party is lyckened to a man / for it should be master and souereyne and that is
propyrly the image of god / For by that only the soul knowyth god and louyth
him / And the neither is lyckened to a woman / for it should be burum to the
over party of reyson / as woman is buxum to man / and that lies in knowing
and rulynge of erthly things: for to use hem dyscretly after need. and for to
refuse he^ when it is no need. for to have ever with it an eye upward to the
over party of reason with dread and reverence for to follow it. Now may I say
y^ a soul that lives after lykynges and the lusts of the flesh / as it
were an vnskylful be. and neither has knowing of god ne desire the virtues
ne to good living. But is al blinded in pride / frette with envy ouerlayed
whth couetyse / defoyled with lecherye / and other great sins / Is not
reformed to ye lyckenesse of god / for it lies and rests fully in the image
of sin. that is sensualyte / A another soul that dredeth god / and
ayenstondeth dedely styrynges of the sensualyte / and follows hem not But
lives resonably in ruelynge and governance of worldly things / and sets
his intent and his will for to pleyse god by his outward works is reformed to
the lyknesse of god in faith / And though he feel the same styrynges of sin
as ye other does / it shall not disease him for heresteth not in hem as that
other does / But a another soul that flees thorugh grace al dedely styrynges
of the se^sualyte and venyals also ferforth yt he felyth hem not is reformed
in feeling / for he folowyth ye ouerparty of reason in beholding of god and
ghostly things, as I shall tell the afterward /

How men that been in sin forshapen hemselfe in to diverse bestes lyckenesse /
And they be^ called the lovers of the world / Caplm^ xiiii
A Wretchyd man is he then that knowyth not y^ worthynesse of his soul ne will
not know it / how it is most worthy creature that ever god made out take an
angel whom it is like to* hye above al other kind bodily. to the which no
thing may suffyse as full rest / but oonly god / And therefore he should
nothing love ne like but him oonly / ne coueyte ne seek but how he might be
reformed to his lyknes. but for he knowyth not this, therefore he sekyth and
coueytyth his rest and his liking outward in bodily creatures werse than him
self is / Unkyndly he does and vnresouably he werkyth y^ leuyth ye souereyn
good and euerstyng life yt is god unsought and vnloued unknown and
vnworshypped. and chesyth his rest and his bliss in a passing delight of an
erthely thing / Nevertheless thus done al ye lovers of this world that have
her Joy and her bliss in this wretchyd life / Some have it in pride and
vaynglory of hemself / ye when they have lost the dread of god they traueyle
and study night and day how they mow come to worship and praysynge of the
world / and maken no force how it be so that they might come thereto and
ouerpasse al men either in clergy or in craft in name or fame. In riches or in
reverence. in souerente and maystershyp. in hye state and lordshyp / Some me^
have her rest in riches and in outrageous hauour of erthly good. and setten
her hertes so fully for to get it. y^ they seek not else but how they might
come thereto / Some have her liking in flesshly lusts of glotenye and lecherye
and in other bodily uncleanness / And some in oo thing and some in a another. And
thus wretchydly these y^ done thus forshapen hemself fro the worthynes of man
and torn hem in to diverse bestes lyckenes / The proud man is turned into a
lion for pride: for he would be drade and worshypped of all men / and that no
man ayenstonde ye fulfyllynge of his flesshly will another in word ne in deed /
And if any man would let his mysproude will he weryth fell and wroth. and
woll be wroken of him as a lion wrekith him on a lytyl be / This man that
does thus is no man for he does vnresonably against y^ kind of a man / and so
he is turned and transfourmed in to a lion / Enuyous and angry men arne turned
in to hou^des thoroughe wrath / an envy ye brekyth again her even criste^ and
bytyth he^ by wicked and malycyous words / and greuyth hem yt have not
trespassed with wrongful deeds. harmyng hem in body and in soul against goddis
bidding / Some men arne forshapen in to asses ye arne slow to ye service of
god. and evil wylled for do any good deed to her even christian / They arne ready
enough for to ren^e for worldly profit and for erthly worship or for
pleysau^ce of an erthly man / But for ghostly mede. for help of her own
souls. or for ye worship of god they are soon yrke they wol not thereof / And
if they ought done they goon but a pase and with froward will / Some are turned
in to swyne for they are so blind in wit and so bestly in manners that they
have no dread of god: but folowen only the lusts and lykynges of her flesh
/ and have no reward to the honest of man / ne for to rule hem after the
bidding of reason / ne for to restrain the unskillful styrynges of the
flesshly kind. but as soon as a flesshly styrynge comyth of sin they are ready
for to fall there to and follow as swyne done / Some men are turned in to
wulfes that lyuen and raueyn as falls covetous men done that thorough maystry
and ouerledyng robben her eue^ christian of her worldly goods / Some men are
turned in to foxes as falls men and deceyuable men that lyuen in trecherye and
gyle / Al these and many other moo yt lyuen not in dread of god: but breken his
commandments forshapen hemself fro the lyknes of god / and maken hem like to
bestes. ye and worse than bestes for they are like to the fend of hell / And
therefore sothly these men yt lyuen thus if they ben not reformed when the hour
of death comes. and the souls of hem are departed fro ye bodies: then shall her
eye be opened yt is now stopped with sin / and then shall they feel and
find the pain of her wretchydnes that they lived in here / And for asmoche as
ye image of god was not reformed thorugh the sacrament of penance in hem
neither in faith ne in feeling here in this life they shall be as cursed cast
out fro ye blessed face of our creator / and they shall be dampened with y^
devil in to the depnes of hell there for to be without end Thus says saint
John^ in thapocalipse / Tumidis et incredulis execratis and homicidis
fornicatoribus venificis and ydolatris and om^ibes mendacibes pars illorum erit
in stagno ardenti igne and sulphur. Apoc. ir.
That is. To proud men and mystrowyng men. to cursed and to men sleers. to
lecherous and covetous. to poyseners and worshyppers of mawmentes. and to al
falls liars her dele shall be with ye devil in the pytte of hell brennyng with
fire and brymston If ye lovers of this world would often think on this how all this world shall pass and draw to an end / and how al wicked love shall be
hard punysshed. they should within short time loath al worldly lusts yt they
now most like / and they should lift up her heart for to love god / and they
would besyly seek and traueyle how they might be reformed to his lyckenes or
they pass hens.

How lovers of this world unable hem in diverse manners to the refourmynge of
her own soul / Capitulum / xv.
BUt now says some of hem thus. I would feign love god and be a good man. and
forsake ye love of the world if that I might / but I have no grace thereto. If
I had the same grace that a good man has I should do as he does / But for I
have it not. therefore I may not and so it is not to me to wit but I am
excused / unto these me^ say I^hus So^h it is as they say yt they have no
grace and therefore they lain still in her sin and may not rise out / But that
avails hem not against god. for it is her own defawte / They unable hem by
diverse ways so much that the light of grace may not shine to hem nerest in
her hertes. For some are so fro ward yt they wol no grace have: ne they wol no
good men be. For they wot well that if they should be good men they must needs
forbere the great liking and the lust of this world that they have in erthly
things / and yt wol they not. For he^ thken it is so sweet yt they wol not
forgo it / And also they must needs take works of penance / As in fasting.
wakyng: prayeng / and many other good deeds doing In chastisynge of their
flessh and i^ withdrawyng of their flesshly will and yt may they not do / For
it is made so sharp and so dredful to her thynkyng that they vggen and lothen
for to think upon it / and so cowardly and wretchydly dwell they stelle in her
sin / Some would have grace as it semyth and begynnen to able hem thereto. but
her will is wonder week / For as soon as any styrynge of sin comyth though it
be contrary to the byddyng of god. they fall anon thereto / for they are so
bound thorugh custom by often falling and often assenting to sin before ye
hem think it impossyble for to ayenstonde it / and so feyned herdnes of
perfourmynge weekyth her will. and smytyth it down aye^ Some also felen styryng
of grace. as when they have bytyng of conscye^ce for her evil living. and that
they should leave it But that is so paynful to he^ and heavy that they wol not
suffer it ne abide it: but they fle therfro and foryete it if they may so
ferforth that they seek liking and comfort outward in flysshly creatures. so
that they should not feel this bytynge of conscience within her soul / And
more over some men are so blind and so bestly that they wene there is none
other life but this. ne yt there is no soul other than a be / and yt ye
soul of a man deyeth with ye body as ye soul of a be / and therefore they
say: Ete we. drink we. and make we merry here for of this life we ben syker:
we see none other heaven / Sothly such are some wretches that sayen thus in her
hertes / though they say it not with her mouth / Of the which men the
prophet says thus / Dixit incipie^s in cord suo no^ est deus / That is / ye
unwise man said in his heart: P.
there is no god / This unwise man is every wretchyd man that lives and
loves syn^e. and chesyth ye love of this world as rest of his soul: he says
there is no god / not with his mouth. for he wol speak of him sometime when he
fares well flesshly as it were in reverence when he says blessed be god /
Sometime in dyspyte when he is angry against god or his even christian. and sweryth
by his blessed body or any of his me^bres / But he says i^ his thought yt
there is no god / and that is either for he weneth yt god sees not his sin
or that he will not punysshe it so hard as holy writ says / or that he wol
foryeue him ye sin though he see it not / or else y^ there shall no christian
man be dampened do he never so evil / Or else if he fast our lady fast. or say
every day a certain oryson / or here every day ii. masses or iii* or do a
certain bodily deed as it were in worship of god. he shall never go to hell do
he never somoche sin though he forsake it not / this man says in his heart
that there is no god / But he is unwise as ye prophet says / For he shall
feel and find in pain yt he is a god whom he forgate and set naught by / but
set by the well of the world as the prophet says / Sola vexacio dabit
intellectu^ auditu^ / That is: I. xx viii.
Oonly pain shall give understanding / For he that knowyth not this here ne
wol not know it: shall well know it when he is in pain.

A lytyl counsel how lovers of this world should do if they wol be
reformed in her soul before her partynge hens / Caplm^ xvi
These men though they wot well that they arne out of grace and in dedely sin
they have no care ne sorrow ne thought therefore. But they make flesshly mirth
and worldly solace asmoche as they may / And the ferder they ben fro grace ye
more mirth they make / and perchance some holden hem well paid yt they have no
grace yt they may as it were the more fully and freely follow ye liking of
flesshly lusts. as though god were a sleep and might not see hem / And this is
one of the most defawte yt may be / And thus by her own frowardnes they stop
the light of grace fro her own soul yt it may not rest therein / the which
grace in asmoche as in it is shyneth to al ghostly creatures ready for to enter
in there it is received; as ye son shyneth over al creatures bodily there it
is not let / thus says saint John^ i^ ye ghospel. Iohi^si
Lux in tenebris lucet and ^enebre ea^ non co^prehenderu^t / That is / the
light of grace shyneth in derkenes / that is to me^nes hertes that are derke
thorugh sin / But the derknesse takes it not / That is these blind hertes
receive not ye gracyous light. ne have not the profit of it: But right as a
blind man is vmbi^apped with the light of ye son when he sto^deth therein.
and yet sees it not. ne has no profit there of for to go thereby / right so
ghostly a soul blinded with dedely syn^e is al vmbylapped with this ghostly
light. and yet he is never the better for he is blinded and wol not see ne
know his blyndenesse And yt is one of the most lettynge of grace. that a
wretchyd man wol not be a know of his own blyndnesse for pride of himself or
else if he know it he charge not. but makyth mirth and game as he were over
al syker / Therefore unto al these men that are thus blinded and bound with the
love of this world / and are foul forshape fro ye fayrhede of man I say and
counseyle that they think on her soul. and yt they able hem unto grace
asmoche as they may. and that may they do upon this wise if that they wol /
When that they feel hemself out of grace and ouerlayed with dedely sin: then
that they think what myscheyf and what peril it is to hem for to be put out of
grace and departed fro god as they ben / For there is no thing that holds
hem fro the pytte of hell that they ne should right soon fall therein but a
bare syngyl ^hrede of this bodily life whereby they hang / what lyghtlyer may
be lost than a syngyl threde may be broken in two / For were the breath stopped
in her body: and that may lightly fall. her soul shall pass forth and anon
be in hell without end / And if they would think thus they should quake and
shake for dread of the ryghtful domes of god. and of the herd punysshynge of
sin / and they should make sorrow and morn for her sin and for lacking of
grace. and then should they cry and pray yt they might have grace / and if
they deed thus then should grace fall in and put out de^knesse and hardness
of heart and weyknes of will / and give hem might and strength for to forsake
the false love of this world as much as is dedely sin / For there is no
soul so far fro god thorugh wyckydnesse of will in dedely sin: I out take
none that lives in this body of syn^e that he ne may thorugh grace be ryghted
and reformed to clennesse oflyuynge. if he woll bow his will to god with
meekness for to amend his life. and hertly axe grace and foryeuenes of him /
and excuse our lord / and fully accuse himself / For holy wryt says. Nolo
morte^ pcco^rissed magis vt co^uertat et viuat / That is. Our lord says: I
wol not ye death of a sinner but I wol more yt he be turned to me and live /
For our lord wol that the most froward man yt lives forshapen thorugh sin
if he torn his will and ask grace that he be reformed to his lyknesse /

That refourmyng in faith and in felyng may not suddenly be gotten by grace and
much bodily and ghostly traueyle i^ length of time: Caplm xvii
THis refourmyng is in faith as I have before said yt lightly may be had / But
after this comyth refourmyng in faith and in feeling that may not lightly
begote but thorugh long trauyle and much business / For refourmynge in faith
in common to al chosen souls though they ben in the lowest degree of charity /
But refourmynge in feeling is specially of these souls yt may come to the
state of perfeccyon and that may not suddenly be had but after great plente of
grace and much ghostly traueyle a soul may come thereto / and that is when he
is first helyd of his ghostly syknes / and when al bitter passions and
flesshly lusts and other old felynges arne burnt out of the heart with fire
of desire and new gracyous felynges arne brought Inn with brennynge love and
ghostly light / Then^e right nyghe hygheth a soul to perfeccyon and to
refourmynge in feeling /

For soth it is. right as a man that is brought nigh to death thorough bodily
syknesse though he receive a medicyne by the which he is restored and syker of
his life / he may not therefore anon rise up and go to work as an hole may
for the feebleness of his body holds him down that he must abide and good
while and keep him well with medicynes. and dyete him by mesure after ye
techynge of a leche till he may fully recover bodily hele Right so ghostly. he
that is brought to ghostly death thorugh dedely sin though he thorugh
medycyne of the sacrament of penance be restored to life that he shall not be
dampened / nevertheless he is not anon hole of all his passions and of al his
flesshly desires ne able to contemplacyon / but him behouyth abide a great
while. and take good keep of himself / and rule him so that he might recover
full hele of soul: for he shall langern a great while or that he be fully hole /
Nevertheless if that he take medecynes of a good leche. and use hem in time with
mesure with dyscrecyon he shall much the sooner be restored to his ghostly
strength. and come to refourminge in feeling / For refourmynge in faith is ye
lowest state of al chosen souls / For byneth yt might they not well be / But
refourmynge in felyng is the highest state in this life that the soul may come
to But fro the lowest to ye highest may not a soul suddenly styrte no more than
a man that wol clymbe upon a ladder hye and sets his foot upon the lowest
stele may at the next flee up to ye highest But him behooves go by process one
after a another till he may come to the ouerest / Right so it is ghostly. no
man is made suddenly souereyne in grace: but thorough long exercise and slye
werkynge of a soul may come thereto / namly when he helpyth and techyth a
wretchid soul in whom al grace lies / For without specyal help and Inwardly
techynge of him may no soul come thereto.

The cause why so few souls in reward of yt multitude of other comen to this
refourmg in faith and in feeling. Caplm^ xviii
BUt now say thou / Sith our lord is so curteys of his goodness. and of his
gracyous yeftes so free / wonder it is then that so few sowles as it semyth in
reward of the multitude of other may come to this refourmynge in feeling / It
semyth yt he were dangerous and that is not sothe / or that he took no reward
of his creatures. the which by taking of faith are become his servants /
Unto this I may answer and say as me thinks. that one enchesen is this /
Many that are reformed in faith setten not her hertes for to profit in grace.
ne for to seek none hyer estate of good living thorugh besye traueyle in
prayeng a thynkyng. and other bodily and ghostly werkynge / but hem think it
enough to hem to keep hemselfe out of dedely sin. and for to stand stylle in
that plyght as they are in / For they say that it is enough to hem for to be
saaf and have the leest degree in heaven / They wol coueyte no more / Thus
perchance does some of the chosen souls that leden in the world actyflyfe /
and that is lytyl wonder of hem / For they are so occupied with worldly
business that needs for to be done that they may not fully set her hertes
for to profit in ghostly we tkynge / And nevertheless it is peryllous to hem.
for they fall out al day / and are now up. and now down. and may not come
to the stablenes of good living. Nevertheless they are somewhat excusable for her
astate of living / But other men and wymmen yt are free fro worldly business
if they woll and may have her nedeful sustynaunce without great bodily besynes
specially as relygyous men and wymmen may that bynden hemselfe to the state of
perfeccyon by taking of relygion. and other men also in seculer state that
have much reason in great kyndly wit. and might if they would dyspose hem
there to come to much grace / These men are more to blame. for they sto^de
stylle as they were idle and wol not prouffyte in grace. ne in no ferder
seeking for to come to the love and the knowing of god / For sothly it is
peryllous to a soul that is reformed oonly in says and wol no more seek
profit. ne give him besyly to ghostly traueyle / for he may so lightly lose
that he has and fall again to dedely sin. For a soul may not stand still
always in one state while that it is in the flesh / For it is either
profytynge in grace or peyrynge in syn^e For it fares by him as it does by a
man that were draw out of a pytte. and when he were up he would no ferder go
than ye pyttes brynke / Sothly he were a much fool for a lytyl puff of wind
or an unwarily styryng of hy^ self should soon cast him down again wors than
he was before / Nevertheless if he fle fro ye brynke as far as he may and go
forth on the earth. then though there come a great storm he is the more syker.
for he falls not in the pytte / Right so ghostly. he that is drawn out of ye
pytte of sin thoroughe refourmynge of faith / and when he is our of dedely
sin he thinks himself syke^ enough / And therefore he wol not profit but
hold him stylle as he is by the pyttys brynke as nere as he may sothely he is
not wise / For at the leest temptacyon of his enmye or of his flesh he
falls in to sin again / But nevertheless if he flee fro the pytte. that is
if he sete his heart fully for to com^ to more grace. and for to traueyle
besyly how he may come thereto. and give him hertly to prayeng. thynkyng and
other good works doing / though great te^ptaco^ns rise ayenste him he fallyth
not lightly to dedely sin again / And sothly it is wonder to me yt sythe^
grace is so good and so profitable why a man wha^ he has but a lytyl thereof ye
so lytyl yt he myt no less have yt he wol say ho / I wol no more of this / for
I have enough / When I se a worldly man though he have of worldly good much
more than him needs / yet he wol never say hoo / I have enough I wol no more
of this / But he wol coueyte more and more: and traueyle all his wits and his
myghtes / And never woll stynte of his coueytyse till he may have no more /
Much more then should a chosen soul coueyte ghostely good yt is everlasting
and makyth a soul blessed / And he never should cease of his coueytyng if he
did well* get what he get might / For he ye most coueyteth most shall have /
And sothly if he did thus he should profit and wexe in grace greatly /

A another cause also of ye same. And how wylful bodily customs indyscretly
rewarded and used sometime hyndren souls fro felyng of more grace / Caplm^ xix
ANother enchesen is this. Some me^ that are reformed in faith in the
beginning of her tornyng to god setten hemself in a certain manner of doing
whether it be bodily or ghostly. and thynken ever for to keep that manner of
worchyng forth / and not for to change it for none other ye comith thorugh
grace though it were better. for they wene that yt doing should be best for
he^ always for to hold / and therefore they resten hem therein. and thorough
custom they bind hem so thereto that when they have fulfilled it they think
hem wonderly eased / For they wene that they have done a great thing to god And
perchance if it fall that they be let fro ye custom though it be for a
skilful cause. they ben heavy and angry. and have troublynge of conscience* as
if they had done a great dedely sin. These men hyndren hemself somewhat fro
felyng of more grace. for they set her perfeccyon in a bodily work. and so
they make an end in the mids of the way where none end is / For why bodily
customs that men use in her beginning are good / but they are but means and
ways ledynge a soul to perfeccyon / And therefore he that says his perfeccyon
i^ a bodily work or in a ghostly work that he felych in ye beginning of his
tornynge to god. and he woll no fe^der seek but ever rest therein. he hyndreth
himself greatly / For it is a simple craft that a prentyse is ever in like
wise in / and that can on the first day as much of it as he can thyrty
winter after / Or else if the craft be good and subtyl he is of a dulle wit
or else of an evil will that profyteth not therein / But then it is soth yt of
al crafts that are. the seruyse of god is most souereyne and the most
subtyl: the highest and hardest for to come to the perfeccyon of it / And also
it most profitable and most of wynnyng to him that may soth fastly perform
it / And therefore it semyth that the prentises of it that are ever ylyke
ferforth in learning either are they dulle wytted or else evil wylled / I
repreue not these customs that men use in the state of beginning whether they
ben bodily or ghostly / for I say that they are full good and spedfull for hem
for to use / But I would that they held hem not but as a way and an enter
toward ghostly feeling. and that they used hem as a couenable mean till a
better come / and that they in using of hem coueyted after better / And then^e
if better come that were more ghostly and more drawing in the thought from
flesshlynes and fro the sensualyte and vayn ymagynacion. if that should be
let by cause of her customs yt they leave then her custom when it may be
left without scaunder or disease of other. and follow that they feel / But if
neither let other then that they use both if they may. I mean not of
customs nedeful thorugh bond of law or of rule or of penance / but of other
wylfully taken / Thus techeth us the prophet in the sawter saying thus Etem^
benediccionem dabit legislator ibunt de virtute in virtutem videbitur deus
deorum in syon / That is: p^. lxxx iii.
Sothly the brynger of the law shall give blessyng they shall go fro virtue in
to virtue / and god of goddys shall be see in syon / The brynger of the law.
that is our lord Ihesu christ shall give his blessing / That is: He shall give
his grace to his chosen souls. calling hem fro sin and ryghtynge hem by
good works to his lyckenesse / thorugh which grace they shall proufyte and
wexe fro virtue to virtue till they come to syon / that is till they come to
contemplacyon / in the which they shall see god of goddys. That is: They shall
see well that there is not but one god /

How that without much bodily and ghostly besynes and without much grace and
meekness souls may not be reformed in feeling / ne keep therein after they
come thereto / Caplm^ xx
NOw say thou. Sith it is so that refourmyng in faith is so low and so
peryllous for to rest in by cause of dread of falling again / And refourmynge
in feeling is so high and so syker / who so might come thereto. Then
coueytest thou for to wit what manner traueyle were most spedful for to use /
by the which a man might prouffyte in. and come thereto. Or if there were any
certain traueyle or specyal deed by the which a man might come to that grace
and that refourmynge in feeling / As unto this I say thus / Thou wotest well
that what man or woman wol dyspose him for to come to clennesse of heart and to
feeling of grace him behooves have much traueylle and great fighting in will
and in work lastyngly against wicked styrynges of all the head sins / Not
oonly ayenste pride or Envy but against al other with all the spyces that comen
out of them / as I have said before in the first writing. For why /
Passions and flesshly desires let the clennesse of the heart and pees in
conscience / And him behooves also for to traueyle for to get al virtues Not
oonly chastyte and abstynence / but also pacyence and myldenesse / charity and
meekness and all the other And this may not be done by one manner of work /
but by diverse works and many after sundry dysposycyons of men / As now
prayenge: now thinking now worchynge some good works / now assayenge them
self in diverse wise / In hunger: in thruste: in cold: in sufferyng of shame
and dyspyte if need be / And in other bodily disease for love of virtue and
sothfastnesse / This know thou well / for this redest thou in every book that
techeth of good living / Thus says every man that wol styre men's souls to
the love of god / And so it semyth that there is no specyal traueyle ne certain
deed thorugh which oonly a soul might come to yt grace but pryncypally
thorugh grace of our lord Ihesu. and by many deeds and great in all yt he may
done. and yet all this is lytyl enough / And one skylle may be this. For since
our lord Ihu^ himself is specyal master of this craft: and he is specyal
leche of ghostly lyknes: for without him al is naught. it is therefore reasonable
that after that he techeth and styreth so a man follow and work / But he is a
simple master that can not teache his dyscyple while he is i^ learning but ever
one lesson / and he is an unwise leche that by one medecyne wol hele al sores /
Therefore our lord Ihesu that is so wise and so good for to show his wysdom
and his goodness he techeth diverse lessons to his dissyples after yt they
profit in her learning. and yeueth to diverse souls sere and diverse medycynes
after the feeling of her syknes / Also a another skylle is this: If there were
any certain deed by the which a soul might come to the perfyte love of god
then should a man wene that he might come thereto by his own work and thorugh
his own traueyle as a merchant comyth to his mede by his own traueyle oonly
and by his own work / Nay it is not so ghostly in the love of god. For he
that wol serve god wisely and come to perfyte love of god. he shall coueyte to
have none other mede but him oonly / But then for to have him may no creature
deserve oonly by his own traueyle / For though a man might traueyle as much
bodily and ghostly as al creatures that ever were might he might not deserve
oonly by his works for to have god to his mede: for he is souereyn bliss and
endless goodness and passyth without co^paryson al me^nes deserts. and therefore
he may not be gote^ by no man's specyal works as bodily mede may / For he is
free and yeuyth hymsefe whet^he wol. and when he wol. neither for this ne for
yt / ne this time ne after yt time / For though a soul worche all ye he can
and may al his life time / Perfyte love of Ihesu shall he never have tylle our
lord Ihesu woll freely give it / Nevertheless on that other side I say also I
hope he yeuyth it not but if a man worche and traueyle all that he can and may.
ye till him think he may no more / or else be in full will thereto if he might
/ And so it semyth yt neither grace oonly without full worchynge of a soul that
in it is / ne worchynge alone without grace brings a soul to the refourmynge
in feeling / yt which refourmyng stondeth in perfyte love and charity / But
that one Joined to that other / that is grace Joined to worchynge brings in
to a soul the blessed feeling of perfyte love / the which grace may not
restfully but on meke souls yt ben full of yt dread of god / Therefore may I
say: he yt has no mekenes ne does his besynes may not come to this
refourmyng in felyng / He has not full mekenes yt can not feel of himself soth
fastly as he is / As thus / He that does all the good deeds that he can / as in
fasting: wakyng: weryng of the heir. and al other suffryng of bodily penance
/ or does al ye outward works of mercy to his even rrysten: or else Inward
/ as prayenge: weeping: syghyng / and thynkyng if he rest ever in hem and leave
somoche to hem: and rewards hem so greatly in his own sight yt he presumyth
of his own deserts. and thinks himself ever rich and good holy and
virtuous / sothly aslonge as he felyth thus he is not meke enough / Ne though
he say or think yt all that he does is of goddis yeft and not of himself. he
is not yet meke enough for he may not yet make himself yet naked of al his
good deeds / ne make him poor sothfastly in spyrite / ne feel himself naught
as he is / And sothly until a soul can feel ably thorugh grace naught
himself. and baren him fro all the good deeds that he does thorugh beholdynge
of sothefastnes of Ihesu he is not perfytly meke / For what is mekenes but
sothfastnes / Sothly naught else / And therefore he that thorugh grace may see
Ihesu how that he does all / And himself does right naught but suffers
Ihesu worche in him what him lykyth he is meke / But this is full hard And as
it were Impossyble. and unreasonable to a man that wortheth al by man's reason.
and sees no ferder for to do many good deeds. and then for to ar rette all
to Ihesu. and set himself at naught / Nevertheless who so might have a
ghostly syghte of soch fastnes him should think it full true and full reasonable
for to do so / And sothly he that has this syghte shall never do the less /
but he shall be styred for to traueyle bodily and ghostly much ye more and with
ye better will / And this may be one cause why some men perauenture swinke and
sweet and pyne her wretchyd body with outragyous penance all her life time and
are ever saying orisons and sawters and many other bedes and yet may they not
come to the ghostly felyng of the love of god as it semyth that some done in
short time with less pain. for they have not that meekness that I spoke of
Also on tha other side I say he that does not his business that thinks
thus. whereto should I traueyle / whereto should I pray or think wake or fast
/ or any other bodily penance do for to come to such grace sythen it may not
be gotten ne had but oonly of ye free yefte of Ihu^ / Therefore I woll abide in
flesshlynes as I am. and right naught do of such works bodily ne ghostly
until he give it / For if he woll give it. he asks no worchynge of me what
so that I do. and how lytyl y^ I do I shall have it / And if he wol not give it.
traueyle I never so fast therefore I get it never the sooner / He y^ says thus
may not come to this refourmyng. for he drawyth himself wylfully to ydlenes of
flessheed: and vnableth him to the yefte of grace in asmoche as he puts fro
him both Inward werkynge that stondyth in lasting desire and in longing to
Ihesu and outward werkyng by traueyle of his body in outward deeds. so may
he not have it / therefore I say he that has no true mekenes ne full hertly
besynes other inward only by great fervor and lasting desire and besye
prayer and thought in god. or else both Inward and outward. may he not come
to this ghostly refourmyng of his image /

An entree how a soul shall have her in menynge and worchynge that woll come
to this refourmynge by ensample of apylgryme going to Iherusalem. And of two
manner of mekenes / Caplm^ xxi.
Nevertheless for thou coueytest for to have some manner worchynge by the which
thou might ye rather nyghen to that refourmynge / I shall say as me thinks
by the grace of our lord Ihesu the shortest and y^ redyest help that I know
in this werchyng / And how that shall be I shall tell the by an ensample of a
good pilgrim upon this wise / There was a man that would go to Jerusalem. And
for he knew not the way he came to a another man yt he hoped knew the way
better thither. and asked whyder he might come to that cite / that other man
said to him that he might not come thither without great disease and much
traueyle / For the way is long and peryllous and full of great thieves and
robbers / and many other lettynges there ben that fallen to a man in the going
/ And also there are manysere ways as it semyth ^edynge thyderwarde / But me^
all day are slain and dyspoyled and may not come to that place that they
coueyten / Nevertheless there is one way the which who so takes it and
holds it he wol undertake that he should come to that cite of Jerusalem. and
he should neu^er lose his life. ne be slain ne deye for defawte He should often
be robbed and evil beat and suffer much dysese in the gooynge. but his life
should be saaf / Then said the pilgrim / So that I may have my life saaf
and come to that place that I coueyte to. I charge not what myschyef I suffer
in going / And therefore say me what thou wolt and sothly I behote the for to
do after the / That other man answers and says thus / Lo I set yt in ye
right way / This is the way. And that thou keep the learning that I teache y^
/ what so thou herest see or felyst that should let the in the way abide
not with it wylfully / tarry not for it wylfully. behold it not: like it not /
dread it not / but ever go forth in thy way. and think that thou would be
at Iherusalem / for that thou couetest. and that thou desyrest. and naught
else but that. And if men rob the and dyspoyl the. beat the: scorn the:
pyspyse ye / strive not again if thou wolte have thy life / but hold yt with
the harm yt thou have. and go forth as naught were. yt thou take no more harm
And also if men wol tarry y^ with tales. and feed y^ with lesynges for to draw
yt to myrthes: and for to leave thy pilgrimage: make a deefere and answer not
again / and say naught else but that thou would be at Jerusalem / And if men
profer ye yeftes and wol make the rich with worldly good. rent not to he^
think ever on Iherusalem / And if thou wol hold this way and do that I have
said. I undertake thy life yt thou shall not be slain. but thou shall come to
ye place yt thou coueytest to / Ghostly to our purpose: Jerusalem is asmoche
for to say as a sight of peace / and betokens contemplacyon in perfyte love
of god / For contemplacyon is naught else but a sight of god which is very
pees / Then if thou coueyte for to come to this blessed sight of very pees. and
be a true pilgrim to Ihr^lm ward. though it be so yt I were never there:
nevertheless as ferforth as I can I shall set yt in ye way thyderwarde / The
beginning of ye high way in ye which thou shall go / is refourmyng in faith
grounded mekely in ye faith and in ye laws of holy church as I have said
before / For trust sykerly though thou have syn^ed here before. if thou be now
reformed by the sacrament of penance after ye law of holy church yt thou
art in ye right way / Now the^ sythe^ thou art in ye syker way if thou wol
speak in thy going and make good Iournayes. ye behooves to hold thise ii.
things often in thy mind. meknes and love: and yt is. I am naught I have
nout. I coueyte naught but one / Thou shall have ye meaning of these words i^
thyn intent and in habyt of thy soul lastyngly though thou have hem not ever
specially in thy thought. for yt needs not. Mekenes says. I am naught I have
nout / Love says I coueyte naught but one: and yt is Ihu^ / These two stre^ges
well festned with ye mind of Ihesu makyth good a cord in ye harp of the soul
when they ben craftly towched with ye finger of reason / For ye lower thou
smytes upon ye one ye hyer sowneth ye other / The less thou felyst yt thou art
or yt thou have of thyself thorugh mekenes / ye more thou coueytest for to have
of Ihu^ in desire of love I mean not only of ye mekenes yt a soul felyth in
ye sight of his own syn^e for freelnes and wretchydnes of this life or of ye
wretchydnes of his even cryste^ / For though this mekenes be sothfast and
medycynable. nevertheless it is boystous and flesshly as in regard not clean ne
soft ne lovely / But I mean also this mekenes yt the soul felyth thorugh
grace in sight and beholding of ye endless being of thyn own heart / For it
fares by works and by desire as it does by styckes and by a fire / For the
more styckes are laid to ye fire: the gretter is the fire. Right so ye more
diverse ghostly workynge yt a man has in his thought for to keep hole his
desire: ye myghtyer and more brennyng shall his desire be to god And therefore
look wisely what work thou can best do. and ye most helpyth for to save
hole this desire to Ihu^ if thou be free and art not bound but under ye common
law. and yt do / Bind yt not to wylfull customs vnchau^gably that should
let ye fredom of thyn heart for to love Ihu^ if grace would vysyte yt
specially / For I shall tell the which customs are ever good and nedeful to be
kept / Loo such custom is ever good to hold ye stondeth in getyng of virtue
and lettyng of syn^e. and ye custom should never be lelft / for thou shall ever
be meke: pacyent. sobre and chaste if thou well do. and so of al other virtues
But the custom of a another thing yt lettyth a better is good for to leave when
time is there a man may As thus. If a man have in custom for to say thus many
beedes / or for to think this manner of thought thus long time / or for to wake
or knele thus long or any other such bodily deed. this custom is for to leave
sometime when reasonable cause lettith or else if more grace comith otherwise /

Of taryenges and te^ptacyons ye souls feel by her ghostly enmyes in her
ghostly knowing and going to Ihrlm. and of remedies against hem / Caplm^ xxii
NOw art thou in ye way and woost how thou shall go Now beware of enmyes yt wol
be besy for to let yt if they may / for her entente is for to put out of
thyn heart that desire and ye longing that thou have to the love of Ihu^ and
for to drive the home again to ye love of worldly vanyte / for there is no thing
that greueth hem so much / These enmyes are pryncypally flesshly desires and
vain dredes yt risen out of thyn heart thorugh corrupcyon of thy flesshly
kind and would let thy desire of the love of god that they might fully and
restfully occupye thyn heart / These are thy next enmyes / Also other enmyes
there are / as unclean spyrytes that are besy with sleyghtes and wyles for to
dysceyue the / But one remedy shall thou have that I said before / What so it
be yt they say trow hem not but hold forth thy way and only desire ye love
of Ihu^ / Answer ever thus / I am naught I have naught I coueyte naught but
oonly the love of our lord Ihu^ If thyn enmyes say to the first thus by
styrynges in heart yt thou art not shryuen aryght. or there is some old sin
hyd in thyn heart yt thou know not ne never were shryuen aryght And therefore
thou must torn home again and leave thy desire and goo shryue ye better / Trow
not this saying for it is false / for thou art shriue^ trust sykerly. and yt
thou art in ye way and yt needs no more ransakynge of shryfte for that yt it
passyd / Hold forth thy way and think on Ihr^lm / Also if they say that thou
art not worthy to have ye love of god. whereto shall thou couete that thou may
not have: ne art not worthy thereto / Trow hem not but go forth and say thus /
Not for I am worthy but for I am unworthy. therefore would I love god / For if I
had it. yt should make me worthy / And sythen I was made thereto though I should
never have it yet wol I coueyte it / and therefore wol I pray and think that I
might get it / And then if thyn enmyes see yt thou begynnest to wexe bold and
well wylled to thy work they begin to wexe aferde of the / Nevertheless they wol
not cease of taryenge the when they may as long as thou art going in the
way / what with dread and manassynge on that one side. what with flaterynge
and falls pleysyng on yt other side for to make ye break thy purpose and torn
home again they wol say thus. If thou hold forth thy desire to Ihesu so fully
trauelyng as thou begynnest. thou shall fall in to sykenes or in to fantasyes
or in to frenesyes as thou see yt some done / Or thou shall fall in to
pouertee and bodily myscheyf. and no man shall well help the / Or thou might
fall in to prive temptacyons of the fend that thou shall not help thyself
For it is wonder peryllous to any man for to give him fully to the love of god
and leave all the world. and no thing coueyte but oonly the love of him. for
so many perils may fall yt a man knows not of / And therefore torn home
again and leave this desire for thou shall never bring it to the end and do as
other worldly men done.

Thus sayen thyn enmyes. but trow he^ not / but hold for thy desire / and
say not else but thou would have Ihesu and be at Ihr^lm / And if they
perceive then thy will so strong y^ thou wolt not spare for sin ne for syknes
for fantasyes ne for frenesyes. for dowtes ne for dredes of ghostly te^ptacyons
/ for myscheyf ne for pouerte / for life ne for death. but ever forth thou wolt
with one thing / and no thing but one. and make deefere to hem as though thou
herd hem not. and hold the forth styfly in thy prayer and in thyn other
ghostly works without styntynge with dyscrecyon after counsel of thy
souereyne or of thy ghostly fader / then begin they for to be wroth and to go
a lytyl nerer the. Then they begin for to rob the and beat the and do the all the shame that they can / And that is when they make that all the deeds yt thou
do ben they never so well done are deuyed of other men as evil. and turned in
to the wors party / And what so ever it be yt thou would have done in help
of thy body or of thy soul it shall be let or hyndred by other men. so yt
thou shall be put fro thy will i^ al thing yt thou skyfully coueytes. and all this they done yt thou sholdest be styred to ire or male^coly or evil will
against thyn even christian / But against al these dyseases and al other that thou
may feel use this remedy Take Ihu^ in thy mind and anger the no more with hem
Tarry not with hem. but think on thy lesson yt thou art naught yt thou have
naught thou may nout lose of erthly good thou coueytest naught but ye love of
Ihu^ and hold forth thy way to Ihr^lm with thy occupacyon / And nevertheless
if thou be tarried sometime thorugh freelte of thyself with such vneases that
fallen to thy bodily life thorugh evil will of man or malice of the fend.
as soon as thou may come again to thyself leave of thy thynkyng of thy disease and
go forth to thy work / Abide not long with hem for dread of thyn enmyes.

Of a general remedy against wicked styrynges and paynful taryenges yt fallen to
her hertes of ye flesh and of ye world and of the fend / Caplm xxiii
ANd after this when thin enmyes see that thou art so well wylled that thou
art not angry nor heavy ne wroth ne much styred ayenste no creature for
ought that they may do or speak ayenste the^ but set thy heart fully for
to suffer all that may fall. ease or unease: praysynge or lacking. and that
thou wolt charge no thing with that that thou might keep thy thought and
thy desire hoole to the love of god. then are they much abashed / But
then woll they assaye the with flaterynge and vain pleysynge / And that is
when they bring to the syghte of thy soul al thy good deeds and virtues / and
bear upon the that all men praysen the and speak good of thy holiness / and how
all men love the and worship the for thy holy living / Thus done thyn enmyes
that thou sholdest think her saying soth and have delight in this vain Joy
and rest the therein / But if thou do well thou shall hold al such Iangelynge
falsed and flaterynge of thyn enmye that profereth the to drink venym tempered
with honye / And therefore refuse it and say thou wol not thereof. but thou
would be at Iherusalem /

Such lettynge thou shall feel or else other like. what of thy flesh what
of the world what of the fend moo than I may reherce now / For a man as
long as he suffers his thought wylfully run about the world in beholdynge
of sundry things he perceyueth few lettynges: But as soon as he drawyth al his
thought and his yernynge to one thing oonly for to have yt. for to know that:
for to love that / and that is oonly Ihesu / then shall he well feel many paynful
lettynges For every thing that he felyth and is not that yt he coueyteth is
lettynge to him / Therefore I have told the of some specially as for example /
And ouermore I say generally that what styrynge that thou felyst of thy
flesh or of the fend pleysaunte or paynful / bitter or sweet: liking or
dredful. gladsom or sorrowful that would draw down thy thought and thy desire
fro the love of Ihesu to worldly vanyte. and let utterly thy ghostly couetyse
that thou haste to the love of him. and that thy heart should be occupied with
that styrynge restyngly. set it at naught / receive it not wylfully. tarry
not therewith to long / But if it be of worldly thing ye behooves needs to be
done to thy self or to thyn even christian. speed the soon of it. and bring it
to an end yt it hang not on thyn heart / If it be a another thing yt needs
not or else it to wcheth not the. charge it not. Iangyll not therewith. ne
anger the not dread it not: like it not. but smite out thyn heart redely and
say thus I am naught I have naught. Naught I seek ne coueyte but the love of
Ihesu / Knight thy thought to this desire and strength it. and maynten it with
prayer and with other ghostly works that thou forgete it not: and it shall led
the in thy right way and save the fro al perils. that though thou feel hem
thou shall not perisshe And I hope that it shall bring the to perfyte love of
our lord Ihu^ / Nevertheless on that other side I say also / what work or
what styrynge it be that may help thy desire strength it and nourysshe it.
and make thy thought ferrest fro lust and mind of the world more hole and
hole and more bren^yng to ye love of god whether it be prayenge or thynkyng.
stylnes or speaking: redyng or herynge / on^lynes or comonyng: going or
syttyng keep it for the time and werche therein allonge as savor lastyth / If
it be so yt thou take therewith mete and drink and sleep as a pilgrim does /
and keep discreco^n in thy worchyng after counsel and ordinance of ye
soueryne. For have he never so great have in his going / yet he wol ete and
drink and sleep. Do thou like wise / For though it let the one time. it shall
forther the a another time /

Of an evil day and a good night what it means / and how ye love of the
world is lykened to an evil day: and the love of god to a good night / Caplm^
xxiiii
If thou wolt wit then what this desire is sothly it is Ihu^ / for he makyth
this desire in ye and yeueth it ye / And he it is ye desires i^ ye / and he it
is yt is desired / He is al and he does al if thou might see him / Thou do
naught but suffrest him worche in thy soul / and assentyst to him with great
gladness of heart yt he wouche sauf for to do so in the / Thou art naught
else but a reasonable Instrument wherein yt he worcheth / And therefore when thou
felyst thy thought by to wehynge of his grace take up with desire to Ihu^ with
a mighty devout will for to plese hy^ and love hy^. the^ think yt thou have
Ihu^ for he it is yt thou desyrest / Behold hy^ well for he goth before yt not
i^ bodily lyknes but vnse^seably by prive presence of his might / Therefore see
him ghostly if thou may and festen althy thought and thyn affection to him. and
follow him where so he gooth. for he shall led the ye right way to Ihr^lm.
that is the sight of pees and contemplacyon / Thus prayed the prophet to the
fader of heaven saying thus / P. xlii.
Emitte luce^ tua^ and veritate^ tuam ipa me deduxetunt et adduxetunt in
montemscm^ tuu^ et in tabernacula tua. That is / Fader of heaven send out thy
light and thy sothfastnesse. yt is thy son Ihu^ / anb he shall led me by
desire in me to ye holy hylle and in to thy tabernacles. that is to the feeling
of perfyte love and heyght in conte^placyon / Of this desire speaks the
prophet thus / Memoriale tuu^ in desiderio ai^e me. Isay. ^con.
Ai^a mea desyderauit te in nocte: sed and sp^us meus i^ p^cordiis meis That
is. Lord Ihesu the mind of the is prynted in desire of my soul / For my
soul has desired the in the night. and my spyryte has coueyted the in all
thynkynges And why the prophet says he has desired god al in ye night as a
tymful space bytwyx days two / For when one day is ended a another comyth not
anon / but first comyth night and departs the days sometime long and
sometime short / and then after comyth a another day The prophet meaned not
only of this manner of night but he meaned a ghostly night / Thou shall
understand that there ben two days or two lyghtes / The first is a falls
light. the ^eco^de is a true light / The false light is the love of this world
that a man has in himself of corrupcyon of his flesh. The true light is
the perfyte love of Ihesu felyd thorugh grace in a man's soul. The love of
this world is a false light / For it passes away and lasts not / and so it
perfourmeth not that that it behoteth / This light behyght the fend to Adam
when he styre him to sin and said thus / Gen^. 3
Aperientur oculi vestri et eritis sicut dii / That is / your eyes shall be
opened and ye shall be as goddys / And he said sothe there For when Ada^ had
sinned anon his Inner eye was sperred and ghostly light withdraw. and his
utter eye were opened / and he felt and saw a new light of flesshlh liking
and worldely love that he saw not before / And so saw he a new day but this
was an evil day / For this was it that Job waryed when he said thus / Pereat
dies in qua natus sum / That is: Job 3.
Perysshe the day in the which I was borne / He waryed not the day rennynge
in the year that god made / but he waryed this day that man made. that is the
concupyscens and the love of this world in the which he was borne thorough he
felyd it not.

Then this day and this light he asked of god that it should perysshe and no
longer last / But the everlasting love of Ihesu is a true day and a blessed
light / For god is both love and light. and he is euerlastyngr as saint John^
says / Qui diligit deum manet in lumine / That is: p^ Ioh. ^
He that loves god dwellyth in the light Than what man perceyueth and sees
the lone of this world falls and faylynge. and for that he woll forsake it and
seek the love of Ihesu / He may not as soon feel the love of him / But he must
abide a while in the night / For he may not suddenly come fro that one light
to that other / that is from the love of the world to perfyte love of god /
This night is naught else but a forberynge and a withdrawynge of the
thought and of the soul fro erthly things by great desire and yernynge for
to love and see and feel Ihesu and gholy things / This is the night / For
right as the night is derke and ever hydyng from al bodily creature: and a
restynges of all bodily deeds / Right so a man that settyth him fully for to
think on Ihesu / and for to desire only ye love of him is besye for to hyde
his thought fro vain beholdynge and perceiving. and his affection fro
flesshly lykyng and loving of al bodily creatures / So that his thonght may
be made free and not subget. ne his affection bound ne pyned ne troubled in no
thing lower ne woors than him self / And if he may do so then it is night
with him / for then he is in derknesse. But this is a good night and a light
derknesse and for it is a stoppyng out of the false love of this world. and it
is a nyghynge of the true day And sothly ye derker yt this nyt is ye nerer is
ye true day of the love of Ihu^ / For the more that ye soul may thorugh
longyng to god be hid fro noise and dyn^e of flesshly affeccyons and unclean
thoughts the nerer it is for to feel the light of ye love of him for it is
even at it. Thus semyth it the prophet meaned when he said thus. Cu^ in
tenebris sedeo dn^s lux mea est. That is: when I sit in derknes our lord is
my light / That is: wha^ my soul is hid fro all styrynges of syn^e as it
were in sleep / then is our lord my light: for then^e nygheth he of his grace
for to show me of his light / Nevertheless this night is sometime paynfull /
first when a man is much foul and is not thorugh grace used to be often in
this derknes but would feign have it / and therefore he sets his thought and
his desire to god ward asmoche as he may / he would not feel ne think but
only of him: and by cause yt he may not lightly have it therefore it is
paynfull / For the custom and the homelynes that he has had with sins
before of the world and of flesshly affeccyons and erthly things / and his
flesshly deeds prees so upon him and ever smite in by maystry and draw down
all the soul to he^ that he may not well be hid fro he^ as soon as he would.
Therefore this derkenes is paynful to him / and namly when grace to wchyth not
habundantly / Nevertheless if it be so with the. be not to heavy ne strive not
much as though thou would through maystry put he^ out of thy thought. for
thou may not do so but abide grace: suffer easily. and break not thy self
tomoche / And slyely if thou may draw thy desire and thy glostly beholding to
Ihu^: as if tho would not charge hem. For wit thou well when thou would
desire Ihesu and oonly think on him. and thou may not freely for prechyng in of
such worldly thoughts: sothly thon art outward of the false day. and thou art
entri^g in to this derkenes / But thy derkenes is not restfull by cause of
disease and vncu^nyng and uncleanness of thyself / And therefore use it often and
it shall by process through felinge of grace be more easy and more restful to
the / And that is when thy soul through grace is made so free and so mighty
and so good and so gadred in to itself that it list not to think on right
naught / Then^e is it in a good derknesse / This naught I mean thus that a
soul may thorugh gracebe gadred into itself freely and holy: and not be
driven against the will ne drawn down by maystry for to think or like or love
with cleui^ge of affecco^n to any sin ol vaynly any erthly thing then
thinks the soul nout / for the^ thynkith it of none erthly thing cleuyngly
This is a rich naught / and this naught and this night is a great ease for ye
soul yt desires ye love of Ihesu / It is in ease as for thought of any
erthly thing nevertheless it is full besy for to think on him / What thing
then makyth this derkenes: Sothly naught else but a gracyous desire for to
have the love of Ihu^ / For ye desire and ye longyng that it has that time to
ye love of god for to see him and have him dryueth out of the heart al worldly
vanytees and flesshly affeccyons. and gadreth the soul in to itself. and
occupyeth it oonly for to think how it might come to ye love of him / and ye
time may it freely and devoutly behold Ihu^ whed it wol pray or think. and
so it bryngyth it to this right nout. and sothly it is not al derke ne nout
wha^ it thynkyth thus. For though it be derke fro falls lyt it is not al derke
fro ye true lyt. for Ihu^ yt is both love and lyt is in this derknes wheder it
be paynful or restful / If it be paynful then^e he is in ye soul as traueylyng
in desire and lo^gyng to light but he is not yet a^ resting in love ne as
showing his light: And therefore it is called night and derknesse in asmoche
as the soul is hyd fro the false light of the world. and has not yet fully
feeling of true light: but is in abidyng of that blessid love of god which it
desires / Thene if thou wolte wit when thou at in this syker derkenesse and
when not / thou may assay thus and seek no ferder but thus / When thou felyst
thyn entente and thy will fully set for to desire god. and think only on
him / thou may as it were first ask thyself in thyn own thought whether
thou coueyte for to have any thing of this life for love of itself or for to
have the use of any of thy bodily wits in any creature / and then if thyn
eye a^swere the thus / I would se right naught / and thy mouche. I would savor
right nonght / and after thyn eere. I would here right naught / and thy body. I
would feel right nout / and after if thine heart say I would think right naught
of erthly thing ne of bodily deed / ne I would have affecco^n fastyned
flesshly to no creature but oonly i^ god / and to god ward if yt I cowde / and
wha^ they answer al thus to the and that is done full redily if grace towche
the. then^e art thou entered so^ what in to this derknes. for though thou feel
and perceive gle^tynges and proferynges of vain thoutes and presing in of
flesshly affeccyons. nevertheless thou art in this profitable derknes if it be
so yt thy thought be not fyxed in he^ / For such vain ymagynaco^ns yt fall in
ye heart vnauysedly trowble^ this derknes / and pyneth ye soul so^ what by
cause yt it would be hyd fro hem and may not / but they do not away ye profit
of this derknes / for the soul shall by ye way come to restful myrknes / And
then is this derknes restful when ye soul is hyd for a time fro ye paynful
feeling of al such vayn thoute^. and only is rested in desire and lo^ginge to
Ihu^ with a ghostly beholding of him as it shall be said afterward But ye
lasts but a while hole. Nevertheless though it be but a short time it is full
profitable

How yt the desire of Ihesu feel in this lyghtsom derknes sleeth al styrynges
of sin. and ableth the soul to perceive ghostly lyghtynges fro the heavenly
Iherusalem yt is Ihesu / Caplm^ xxv
THen sithen this derknes and this night is so good and so restfull though it
be short that stondeth only in desire and longyng to the love of Ihesu with a
blind thinking on him how good then and how blessed is it for to feel his
love. and for to be illumided with his blessed vnseable present light for to
see sothfastnes / the which light a soul receives wha^ the night passith
and the day spryngeth / This I hope was the night yt the prophet meaned when
he said: My soul has desired yt in ye nyt / as I have before said. it is
much better to be hyd i^ this derke night fro beholding of y^ world though it
were paynfull: than for to be out in falls lykyng of this world yt semyth so
shinyng and so comfortable to hem yt are blind in knowing of ghostly light /
For wha^ thou art in this derknes thou art mekyl nerer Ihr^lm. than when thou
art in the mids of the false light. therefore apply thyn heart fully to the
steryng of grace: and use for to dwellen in this derknes and be often assayenge
to be^ homely the^in: and it shall sone be made restful to the. and ye true
light of ghostly knowing shall spring to the. not all at onys but preuyly by
lytyl and by lytyl as ye prophet says Hi^tantibus in regione vmbre martis:
lux orta est eis. That is: Isay. con
To the dwelling in the country of shadow of death: light was sprongen. yt is:
light of grace spronge and shall spryng to al hem yt can dwell in the shadow
of death / yt is in this derknes. yt is like to death / for as death sleeth a
living body and al flesshly felynges of it right so desire to love Ihu^ felyd
in this derkenes sleeth al sins. al flesshly affeccyons and al unclean
thoughts for ye time. and than nyghest thou fast to Ihr^lm. thou art not yet
at it / but be small sodeyne lyghtynges that glydern outthorughe small cauys
fro that cite shall thou mow seen is fro far or that thou come thereto / For
wete thou well though that thy soul be in this restful derknes withouten
troublyng of worldly vanytees it is not yet there it should be / it is not yet
clothyd al in light ne turned al in to fire of love. but it felyth well that
there is some what above itself yt it knowith not ne has not yet / but would
have it. and breunyngly desires it. and that is not else but the light of
Ihr^lm without forth. the which is like to a cite that the prophet ezechyel
saw in his vysyons. He says that he saw a cite set upon an hylle heldynge
to ye south. yt to his sight when it was meten was no more of length and of
bread than a rod yt was six cubytes and a palm of length: but as soon as
he was brought in to the cite and looked about him than thought him yt it was
wonder mekyl. for he saw many halles and chaumbrys both open and preuy. he
saw gates and porches. vtterwarde and innerwarde and mekyl more byggyng than I
say now on length and on bread many hundred cubytes thanne was this wonder to
him how this cite within was so long and so large yt was so lytyl to his sight
when he was without / This cite betokens yt pertyte love of god set in the
hylle of cote^placyon. yt which* unto ye sight of a soul yt without the
feeling of it traueyleth in the desire toward semyth somewhat / but it semyth
but a lytyl thing no more than a reed that is vi. cubits and a palm of
length / By vi. cubytes are understood ye perfeccyon on man^es work / And by
y^ palm a lytyl towchynge of conte^placyon / He sees well yt there is such a
thing yt passes ye deserte of al ye worchyng of man a lytyl as the palm
passes the vi. cubits / but he sees not within what it is / nevertheless if
he may come within the cite of contemplocyon / then sees he much more than
he saw first /

How a man shall know falls Illumynacyons feyned by the fend fro ye true light
of knowing ye comyth out of Ihu^ and by what tokens / Caplm^ xxvi
BUt now bewaar of the myddaye fend y^ feyneth light as it came out of Ihr^lm
and is not so. For the ten^e sees yt our lord Ihu^ shewyth light to his
lovers of sothfastnesse / therefore in the ^eceyuing of he^ yt are unwise he
shewyth a light yt is not true under color of a true light and deceyueth he^.
Nevertheless how a soul may know the light of sothfastnes when it shyneth from
god and when it is feyned thorugh ye enmye shall I say as me thinks by an
ensample of the fyrmament / Somtym^ the fyrmament shewyth a light fro the son
/ and semyth ye son and is not / And sometime shewyth ye true son truly / A
knowing of ye one from ye other is this. The feyned son she with him not but
bitwixe two black reyny clouds / Then^e by cause ye son is nere there
shyneth out fro the clowles a light as it were alo^ne and is none / But the
true son she with him when the frymament is clear or much clered fro the
black clouds / Now to our purpose Some me^ as it semich forsakith the love of
the world and would come to the love of god and to ye light of understanding
of him. But they woll not come through this derknes that I have spoken of before
/ They woll know hemfelfe truly ne mekely what they have be^ before ne what
they are yet through syn^e / ne how naught they are in her own kind against god
They are not besy for to entree in to hemself al other things outward left.
and flee al wicked stirynges yt risen in her hertes of pride envy ire or other
sins through lastyng desire to Ihesu in praye^ge and in thinking: in scylence
and in weeping / and in other bodily and ghlostly exercise as deuoutemen and
holy men have done / But as soon as they have forsake the world as it were
outward in lyknesse or else sone after they wene that they are holy and able
for to have the ghostly understanding of the gospel and of holy writ / and
namly if they may fulfill letterly the commandments of god and keep hem fro
bodily sins that they wene yt they love god perfytly / And therefore they wol
anon preche and teache al other men as if they had received grace of
vndersto^dinge i^ perfecco^n of charity through special yeft of the holy ghost
And also there are much more styred for as much as they feel sometime much
knowing as it were sondenly yeuen to hem without great study before had. and
also much fervor of love as it semyth for to preche troth and ritwysnes to
her eue^cryste^ / Therefore they hold it as a grace of god yt vylyteth hem with
his blessid light before other souls Nevertheless if they wol look well about
hem they shall find yt this light of knowing and yt hete yt they feel comith
not of ye true son y^ is our lord Ihu^. but it comyth fro y^ myddaye fend yt
feyneth light and lykneth him to the son. and therefore shall he be known by
example before said Light of cu^nyng y^ is feyned by ye fend to a derke swole
is showed bytwyx two black reyny clouds / The over cloud is presu^pcyo^ and
hygheng of he^self The nether cloud is down puttyng and aloweng of his
enencryste^ Then what light of knowing or felyng of fervor y^ it be y^ shyneth
to a soul which presu^pcyo^ and hyeng of itself and disdeyne of his euencryste^
y^ same time felyd it is not light of grace yeuen of ye holy ghost though ye
knowing in itself were sothfast / but it is either of the fend if it come
suddenly or else of man's own wit if it come by study: And so it may well
be known. yt this feyned light of knowing is not y^ light of ye true son /
therefore they y^ have this knowing on this manner are full of ghostly pride and
seen it not. they are so blind with this feyned lyt yt they hold ye highness
of her own heart and thu^buxo^nes to ye laws of holy church as it were perfyte
mekenes to y^ gospel and to the laws of god / and they wene that the following
of her own will were freedom of spryte / and therefore they begin to reyne as
black clouds water of errous and heresies: for ye words that they she wen by
prechynge so when al to bachytyng and to striuynge and to dyscorde / making
repreuyng of states and of persons / and yet sayen they that all this is
charity and zele of ryghtwysnes / But it is not soth. for saint James thapostle
says thus / Uhi enim zelus et contencio ibi inconsta^cia et omne opus prauum /
Non est sapiencia hec desursu^ desce^dens a patre luminu^. sed est terrena a
i^alis and diabolica / That is: where so envy is and flytynge there is
vnstablynes and all evil work / And therefore that cnnnynge that brings
forth such si^nes comyth not from the sader of light that is good / but it is
erthly beestly and fendly / And so by thise tokens that are pride presu^pcion
vnbuxomnes Indignacyon bacbytynge and other such sins for thise folowen
after. may the feyneth light be known for the crew / For the true sonue
shines and shows him not by specyal vysitacion for to give light of
vnderstnoding or perfyte charity to a soul but the fyrmament be first made
bryghte and clear fro clouds / that is: but if the conscience be made clean
through fire of brennyng desire to Ihesu in this derkenes the which wastes and
brenneth all wicked stirynges of pride. vaynglory: ire envy: and al other
sins in the soul as the prophet says / Ignis ante ipsu^ precedet et inflam
mabit incircuitu iuimicos eius. p^. concon.
Fire shall goo before him: That is desire of love shall go before Ihesu in
man's soul / and it shall bre^ne all his enmyes / that is: it shall waste all
synes / For but if a soul be first smyten down fro the heighte of itself by
dread and mekenes and bewel examined and burnt in this fire of desire / And as
it were puryfied fro all ghostly fylthe by long time in devout prayers and
other ghostly exercyses it is not able to suffer the shinynge of ghostly light
/ ne for to receive the precious lycour of perfyte love of Ihesu / But wha^ it
is purifyed and made subtle thorugh this fire then may it receive the
gracyous light of ghostly knowing and the perfeccyo^ of love that is true
son Thus says holy write / mo^ liiii
Uobis qui timetis deu^ oriet ^ol iusticie: ye true son of rightwysnes yt is
our lord Ihesu shall spring to yo^ that drede^ him / y^ is to meke souls y^
meken hemsel under her euencristen by knowi^ge of her own wretchydnesse and
caste^ he^self down wnder god by noughtynge of hemselfe in her own substance
thorugh reverence dread and ghostly beholding of him lastyngly / for that the
perfyte mekenes / Unto these souls the true son shall spryng. and Illumyn her
reason in knowing of sothfastnes / and kyndleth her affection in brynnynge of
love and then shall they both brenne and shine / They shall thorughe virtue
of this heavenly son brenne in perfyte love: and shine in knowing of god and
ghostly things / for then they ben reformed in feeling / Therefore he that wol
not be deceived I hope it is good to him to draw down himself and hyde him
in this derkenes / First from entermetyng of other me^ as I have said / and
forgete all the world if he may and follow Ihesu with lasting desire offered
in prayers and thinking on him / Then I trow the light that comyth after
this derkenes is syker and sothtaste / and that it shyneth of the cite of
Iherusalem from the true son to a soul that traueyleth in derknes / and
cries after light for to wyssen it the way* and comfort it in traueyle. For
I hope after true derkenes before comyth never teyned light.

That is if a man truly and fully set him to forsake the love of the world
/ And may thorughe grace come to feeling and knowing of himself / And hold
him mekely in that feeling / he shall not be dysceyued with none erroures ne
heresies / ne with fantasyes / For all these comen by the gate of pride /
Then if that pride may be stopped out / then there shall no such syn^e rest
in a soul / And though that they come and profer hem hem they shall not enter
/ For grace that the soul felyth in this meke derkenes shall teache the soul
sothtastnes. and show to him that all such profetynges are o^ the enmyes /

How great profit is it to a soul to be brought thorugh grace into lyghtsom
derknes / And how a man shall dyspose him if he wol come thereto / Caplm^ / xxvii
THere are many devout souls that thorugh grace come in to this derkenes and
felen the knowing of hemself and yet wot they not fully what it is. and ye
unknowing in party hyndred hem / They feel well often her thought and her
aff^ccyon drawn out and departed fro the mind of erthly things and brought
in to great rest of a delectable softnes without pinful trowblyng of vain
thoughts or of her bodily wits / and they feel ye time so great freedom of
spyryte yt they may think on Jhesu peasyble / and offer her psalms and
prayers myghtyly sauourly and swetly to him aslonge as freelte of bodily kind
may suffer it / They wot well yt this feeling is good / but they noot what it
is / Therefore unto all such souls I say as me thinks: yt this manner of
feeling though it be but short and but syldom it is soth fastly this derkenes
that I speak of / For it is a felyng of himself first and a rysynge above
hemselfe thorughe breunynge dysyre to the sight of Ihu^ / Or else if I shall
say more sothly. this gracyous feeling is a ghostly sight of Ihesu / And if
they may keep hem in that rest or bring it thorughe grace in to a custom so
yt they myt lghtly and freely have it when hem list. and hold hem in it / they
should never be overcome by te^ptycyon of the fend ne of the flesh / ne by
errors ne heresies: for they are set in the gate of contemplacyon able and
ready for to receive yt perfyte love of Ihu^. Therefore he that has it. it is
good yt he know it mekely / keep it tenderly / and pursew it fervently yt no
creature let him utterly from it yt he ne follow it when he may / And yt he
forgete and set at naught al thing yt should put him fro this if he be free
of himself / and may do what he wol without sclaunder or disease of his
euencryste^ / For me thynkyth that he may not come to this rest lightly but if
he have great ple^te of grace / and set him for to follow after ye styryng of
grace And yt owes he for to do / For grace wol ever be free / namely fro sin
and worldly besenes. and from al other things yt letten the worthyng of it
though they are no sin Nevertheless a another soul yt has not yet received
this fulness of grace if he desire for to com^ to these ghostly knowing of Ihu^ /
as much as in him is he must able him self to it. and put away al lettynges yt
stoppen grace as much as he may / He must learn for to deye to ye world and
forsake ye love of it truly / First pride bodily and ghostly yt he desire no
worthyp / worldly cunning. ne worldly cratt / benefyces ne richesse / precious
clothi^g: ne worldely array / ne no thing where through he should be worshypes
above other me^ / He shall coueyte none of a thise But if they ben put upon him.
take hem with dread so yt he be poor both outward and In ward / or else
fully Inward in heart / And yt he coueyte for to be forgete^ of ye world ye
men reward him no more be he never so rich ne so cunning than ye poorest man
that lives / Also that he suffers not his heart rest in beholding of his
own deeds or in his virtues / wenynge that he does better than a another / for
he forsakyth the world and other done not so / and therefore sets well by him
self / Also he must leave all rysynge of heart and evil will of ire and envy
against his euencristen / And that he disease no man ne anger him vnskyfully in
word ne in deed / ne give any man matere where thorugh he might skylfully be
angered or styred / so that he mygh to be free fro every man / And also that he
forsake couetyse that he coueyte right naught of erthly goo^ / but oonly ask
his bodily sustenaunce that him needs and hold him paid when god styreth
other men for to give him / And yt he put no manner of trust in hauour of any
worldly good / ne in help or favor of any worldly friend but pryncypally and
fully in god / For if he do otherwise he byndeth himself to the world / And
he may not therefore be free for to think on Ihesu / And also glotenye and
lecherye and al other flesshly uncleanness utterly he must leave. that the
affection be bound to no woman by flesshly homlynesse / For it is no dowte
that such blind love that is sometime atwyxe a man and a woman / and semyth
good and honest for as much as they would notsynne in deed / in the sight of
god is full unclean and well great sin / For it is a great sin that a man
shall suffer his affection that should be festened to Ihesu and to al virtues
and to al ghostly clen^es for to be bound with any flesshly love of any
creature wylfully namly if it be so much that it bears down the thought:
and makyth it unrestful that he may no savor have in god / Thus I hold it
wylfully that a man does it and says it is sin or else is so blinded with
it that he woll not see it / And also that a man coueyte not delyces of metes
and drynkes oonly for lust of his flesh / but hold him paid with such mete
as he may easily have without great besynes namly if he be hole what mete it be
that wol do away hungre / and keep ye body in common strength unto ye seruyse
of god And that he grutche not ne strive not ne anger him not for his mete
though he be sometime not served as ye flesh would / Althyse sins and al
other must be forsake utterly in his will and in deed when he may. And other
things that lets him so that he may dyspose him for to think freely on
Ihesu. For as long as these lettynges and such other hang upon him he may
not deye to the world: ne come in to this derkenesse of knowing of himself /
And therefore that he might come thereto he must do all these. as saint poul
did saye^g thus / Michi mundus crucifixus est et ego mu^do / This world is
slain and crucyfied to me. gal. v.
and I to the world / That is: He yt has forsake the love of the world in
worshippes and riches in all other worldly things before said for the love of
god. and loves not it ne pursewyth not it but is well paid that he has right
naught of it ne would have though be might. sothly to him the world is deed /
for he has no savor ne delight theryn / Also if the world set him at
naught and has no reward to him ne favor ne worship: ne set no price by
him but forgeteth him as a deed man / then is he deed to the world / And in
this plyght was saint poul set perfytly. and so must a another man in party
that would follow and come to the perfect love of god / For he may not live to
god fully but if he deye first to the world / This deyenge to the world is
this derkenes / and it is the gate of co^templaco^n and to refourmyng in
felyng. and none other than this. There may be many su^dryd ways and seere
works lettinge and ledyng sundry soulys to conte^placion / For after diverse
disposynges of men and after sundry states. as are religyous and seculers that
they are in. are diverse exercises in worchyng / Nevertheless there is no gate
but one / For what exercises it be that a soul has. but if he may come by
that exercise to this knowing and to a meke feeling of himself / and that is
that he be mortifyed and deed to the world as in his love / and that he may
feel himself sometime in this restful derkenes / by the which he may be hid
fro vanytee of the world as in his love. and that he may feel himself what
he is sothly he is not yet come to the refourmynge in feeling ne has not fully
contemplacio^ / He is full far therfro / and if he woll come by any gate. he
is but a theyf and a breker of ye wall / And therefore as unworthy he shall be
cast out / But he that can bring himself first to naught through grace of
mekenes and deye on this manner he is in the gate / for he is deed to the
world. and he lives to god / Of the which saint poul spekith thus: Call. 3.
Mortui enim estis et vita vestra abscondita est cum christo in deo / ye are
deed / That is: ye that for the love of god forsaken all the love of the world
are deed to the world with christ in god / That is: ye live ghostly in the
love of Ihesu / But your life is hid from worldly men as christ lives and is
hid in his god head fro the love and the syghte of flesshly lovers / This
gate out lord him self showed in the gospel when he said thus /

m. xi iii
Omnis qui reliquerit patrem aut matrem fraterm autsororem proptet me sentuplum
acciptet et vitam etecnam possidebit /

Every man that forsakyth for my love fader or mother sister or brother / or any
good erthly he shall have an hundredth fold in this life / and afterward ye
bliss heaven / This hundredth fold that a soul shall have if he forsake the
world is naught but ye profit of this lightly derknes / the which I call
the gate of contemplaco^n For he yt is in this derkenes and is hyd thorughe
grace fro worldly vanytee he coueyteth naught of worldly good / he sechyth it
not / he is not tarried therewith / he lokyth not after it / he loves it not /
And therefore has he an hundredth fold more tha^ the king or tha^ he has that
couei^teth most of erthly good / For he yt nonght coueyteth but Ihesu has an
hundredth fold / For he has more rest more pees in heart / more very love
And delight in soul in one day than he that most coueyteth of the world And
has all the well of it under his welthe has in all his life time /

This is then a good derkenesse and a rich naught yt brings a soul to so
much ghostly ease and so stylle softness / P.
I trow dauyd meaned of this night / or of this naught when he said thus / Ad
michilum redactus sum et nesciui / That is: I was brought to naught. and I
wyste not / That is / The grace of our lord Ihesu sent in to mine heart has
slain in me / And brought to naught all the love of the world and I wist not
how / For through no worchynge of myself ne by mine own wit I have it not but
of the grace of our lord Ihesu / And therefore me thynkyth he that woll have
the light of grace and fulsomly feel the love of Ihesu in his soul he must
forsake all the false light or worldly love and abide in this derknes / And
nevertheless if he be adrad first for to won^e therein torn not again to the love
of the world but suffer a while. and put al his hope and his trust in Ihesu /
and he shall not long be without some ghostly light / Thus byddeth the
prophet. Isay. x
Qui ambulat in tenebris et non est lumen ei speret in dn^o and inuitarursuper
deu^ suum / who so gooth in derkenes and has no light. That is. Who so wol
hyde him fro the love of the world and may not redily feel light of ghostly
love dyspeyre not / turn not again to the world but hope in our lord and
leen upon him / that is: trust in god / and cleue to him by desire / And abide
a while and he shall have light / For it falls thereby as it does if a man
had be a great while in the son /

And after that came suddenly in to a derkehous there no son shyneth. He
should be as he were blind / and see right nout but if he would abide a while
he shall mow see sone about him / First great things and sythe^ small / and
after al yt ever is in the house / Right so it is ghostly he that forsakes the
love of the world and comyth to himself in to his own conscience. it is
first derke somewhat and blind to his sight / but if he stand still and hold
forth with besyprayeng and often thynkyng of ye same will to the love of Ihu^:
he shall mow see afterward great things and small yt he first knew not. thus
semyth ye prophet behit say^ng thus / Orietur in tenebris lux tua and tenebre
tue erunt sicut meridies and requiem da bit tibi dn^s deus tuus and implebit
ai^am tuam splendori bus / That is: Light shall spring to yt in derknes. that
is thou that forsakyst sothfastly the light of al worldly love and hydest thy
thought in this derknes. light of blyssed love and ghostly knowing of god shall
spring to the. and thy derknes shall be as myd day. that is thy derknes of
traueylynge desire and thy blind trust in god yt thou have first shall turn in
to clear knowing and i^ to sykernes of love. and thy lord god shall give rest
to ye / yt is thy flesshly desires and thy paynful dredes and doutes and wicked
spyrytes that have contynuelly before time traueylyd the / all thise shall
weyken and lose much of her might / and thou shall be made so strong that they
shall not dear y^. for thou shall be hyd in rest fro hem and than shall our
lord Ihesu fulfill thy soul with shynynges / that is. when thou art brought in
to this ghostly rest than shall thou more esely tente to god and naught else
do but louen him and than shall he with bemys of ghostly light fulfill all the
myghtes of thy soul. Have thou no wonder though I call the forsakynge of
worldly love derknes for the prophet callyth it so seyeng thus to a sole /
Isaxi vii.
Intra i^ tenebras tuas filia caldeorum / Go in to thy derknes thou daughter of
caldee yt is. Thou souse ye art as a daughter of caldee for love of ye world
/ forsake it and go in to thy derknes.

That in refourmynge of a soul yt werkynge of our lord Ihu^ is departed in to
four times. yt is / calling ryghtynge. magnyfyenge and gloryfyenge /
Capitulum / xxviii.
LO I have said to yt a lytyl if thou coueyte for to be reformed in feeling
how thou shall dyspose yt toward in thy forthgoyng / Nevertheless I say not yt
thou may do thus of this elfe* for I wot well yt our lord Ihu^ brings all this to ye end where that he would. For he oonly thorugh his grace styreth a
soul. and brings a soul i^ to this derknes first: p^ cxxx vii.
and sythe^ i^ light as ye prophet says / Sicut tenebre eius ita and lume^
eius That is Right as the light of knowing and the feleng of ghostly love is of
Ihu^ right so the derknes. that is yt for sakyng of worldly love is of him for
he does al: He fourmyth and refourmyth He fourmyth only by himself. but he
refourmyth us with us / For grace yeuen and aplyenge of our will to grace
worcheth all this / And on what manner wise he does that / To viii
saint poul reherceth thus / Quos deus p^scinit fieri conformes ymaginis filii
eius hos vocauit. Et quos vocauit hos iustificauit / Et quos iustificauit hos
magnificauit. Et quos magnificauit hos et glorificabit / Thise ye god knew
before should be made shapely to the image of his son. these he called: these
he ryghted. these he magnyfyed. and these he gloryfyed / Though these words
may be said of all chosen souls in the lowest degree of charity that are
reformed only in faith: nevertheless they may be understand more specially of
these souls that arne reformed in feeling to the which our lord god shewyth
much plente of grace and does much more besynes about hem / For they are his
own sons specially that here the fulshappe and the lyckenes of his son Ihu^
/ In the which words saint poule departs the worchyng of our lord in four
times / First is the time of calling of a soul fro worldly vanyte / and that
time is often easy and comfortable / For in beginning of tornynge such a man
that is disposed to much grace is so quyckely and so felyngly inspyred. and
felyth often so great swetnes of devotion: and has so many teres in compunction
y^ he thynkyth him sometime as he were half in henen / but this softnes passyth
after for a time / And then comyth the second time that is the time of
ryghtynge yt is trauelous / For when he begins for to goo forth myghtely in
the way of ryghtwysnes. and settyth his wylful against al sin without and
within. And stretchith out his desire to virtues and to the love of Ihu^ then
felyth he much lettynge both with himself of frowardenes and hardness of his
own will / and fro without forth through temptacion of his enmye that he is often
in full great tourment / And that is no wonder / For he has so long be crooked
to the false love of the world that he may not be made right / as a crokyd
staff may not be made even but if he be cast and weyked in the fire /
Therefore our lord Ihu^ seenge se^deth what thing is behoueful to a froward
soul suffers it to be traueyled and tarried by sundry te^ptacyons. and for to
be well examyned thorugh ghostly tribulacyons that all the ruste of uncleanness
might be burnt out of it / And that shall be both within of dredes and dowtes
and perplexitees that it shall nere hand fall in dyspeyre and it shall seem as
it were forsaken of god and left all in the hondes of the fend out taken a
lytyl preuy trust that it shall have in ye goodness of god and in his mercy. For
that preuy trust our lord leueth in such a soul goo he never so far fro
it. by the which the soul is borne up fro dispeyre and saved fro ghostly
myscheyf. And also without itself it shall be mortifyed and pyned in the
se^sualyte / either by diverse syknes or by feable tourment of the fend. or
else through a preuy might of god the sely soul by feeling and berynge of the
wretched body shall be so pyned. And it shall not wit how that it shall mow
suffer for to be in the bo^y ne were that our lord Ihesu kept it therein / And
yet nevertheless had the soul lever for to be in all this pyne than for to be
blinded with the false love of the world. for that were hell to such a soul
/ But the sufferynge of this manner pyne is naught but purgatory / and
therefore he suffryth it gladly / and he would not put it away though he
might / for it is so prouffytable / All this does our lord in great
prouffyte of the soul / for to drive it out of the se^sualyte / that it
might receive ghostly light / For after this when the soul is thus mortyfied
and brought fro worldly love in to this derknesse / yt it has no more savor
ne delight of worldly liking than of ye straw / But he thynkye it bitter as
wormode / Then commyth the third time of magnyfieng / And that is when the
soul is reformed in feeling in party. and receives the yefte of perfeccyon
and the grace of contemplacyon / and that is a time of great rest / for then
is Ihesu more homely with a soul / And after this comyth the fourth time of
gloryfyenge / That is when the soul shall be fully reformed in the bliss of
heaven / For these souls that arne thus called fro sin and thus ryghted or
else on other manner like by diverse assayenge both thoroughe fire and water.
and afterward are thus magnyfyed they should be gloryfyed / For our lord shall
then give he^ fully yt they here coueyted / and more than they cowde couete /
for he shall areyse hem above al other chosen souls to the eue^ head of
cherubyn and seraphyn / sythen they passed all other in knowing and loving of
god here in this life / Therefore he that woll come to this magnifyeng dread not
this rightyng / for that is the way / For our lord says by his prophet a
word of great confort to all such souls that are examined with fire of
tribulacyon thus / Puer meus noli timere. Isa. xliii.
Si transieris perignem flamma non nocebitte That is: My child if thou pass
thorugh fire dread not for the flame shall not dear the It shall cle^se the fro
all flesshly fylthe / and make the able to receive ghostly fire of the love of
god / and that needs for to be done first For as I have before said. it may
not else be reformed in feeling /

How it falls sometime that souls begyn^yng at profytynge in grace seem to
have more love as by outward tokens than some have that been perfyte / and yet
it is not so in soth within / Caplm^ xxix.
BUt now say thou how may this be sothe For there are many souls new
turned to god that have many ghostly felynges Some have great compunction for
her sins. and some have great deuocyons and feruours in her prayers. and
often have sundry techinges of ghostly lite in understanding: and some men have
other manner felynges of confortable hete and great swetnes / and nevertheless
thise souls come never fully in this restfull derkenes that I speak of with
fervent desire and lastyng love and thought in god: Then^e ask thou whether
thise souls be reformed i^ feeling or naught / It seems yes. in asmoche as
they have such great ghostly felynges that other me^ that sto^de only i^ faith
feel not of / Unto this I may say as me thynkith that thise ghostly feeling
whether they stand in compunction or devotion or in ghostly ymaginacyon are
not the felynges which a soul shall have and feel i^ the grace of
contemplacion / I say not but they are sothfast and gracyously yeue^ of god /
But these souls that felen such are not yet reformed in feeling: ne they
have not yet y^ yefte of perfeccio^ ne ghostly the brenninge love of. Ihu^ as
they may come to / And nevertheless often it semyth otherwise: that such
souls feel more of the love of god tha^ other that have the yefte of
perfeccyon / in asmoche as the felyng shewyth more outward by great fervor of
bodily tokens. in weeping prayenge knelinge and speaking and other bodily
styrynge. so ferforth that it semyth to a another man that they were ever
rauysshed in love / And though me thynkith it is not so / well I wot that
thise manner felinges and feruours of deuocio^ and compunccion that thise men
feel are gracious ^eftes of god sent in to chose^ souls for to draw he^ out
of worldly love and flesshly lust that has been long time roted in her heart.
fro the which love they should not be drawn out but by such feable stirynge
of great feruours: never theles yt the feruours is somoche in outward showing
it is not only for mochenes of love yt they have but it is for litylnes and
weyknes of her soul that may not bear a lityl towching of god for it is yet as
it were fleshly festned to the flesh and never was yet departed fro ghostly
mortifyeng: and therefore the lest towching of love and the lest sperkyl of
ghostly lyte sent fro heaven in to such a soul is so much and so comfortable
and so delectable over all the likinge that ever it felt before in flesshly
love of erthly thing yt it is overtaken with it / And also it is so new and
sodeyn and so uncouth that it may not suffer for to bear it but brestyth and
shewyth out in weeping sobbyng and other bodily stirynge / Right as the
costrell yt is old when it receives new wine that is fresshe And mighty: the
costrel boyleth out and is in point for to cleue and breast until the wine
has boylled and spourged out al uncleanness / but also sone as the wine is
fined and cleryd then it stondeth still and the costrel hole / Right so a
sonle that is old through sin when it receives a lytyl of the love of god
that is so fresshe and so mighty yt the body is in point, for to cleue and to
break ne were that god kepith it hole / But yet it brestyth out at the eyes by
weping. and at ye mouth by spekyng. and yt is more for weyknes and feebleness of
the soul tha^ for mykylnes of love / For afterward when love has boiled all the uncleanness out of the soul by such great feruours then is the love clear
and stondeth still: And then is both the body and the soul much more in pees
and yet has the soul much more love than it had before though it shewelesse
outward / For it is now al hole in rest within. and naught but lityll in
outward showing of fervor / And therefore I say yt these souls yt fele^
such great hodily feruours though they be^ in much grace are not yet
reformed in feeling but they are gretely dysposed toward. For I trow that
such a man na^ly yt has be greatly defoylled in syn^e shall not be reformed in
feeling but if he be first burnt and purifyed with such great compunccyons
going before /

Another soul that never was much defoyleth with love of ye world but has
ever be kept fro great sins in innoce^ce may lyghtlyer and more pryuely
without great fervor showed outward com^ to this refourmynge / Then is this
soch as I hope that such comfortes and feruours that a soul felyth in the
state of begyn^ynge or of profytyng are as it were his ghostly food sent fro
heaven for to strength him in his trauely / Right as a pilgrim traueyleth al
day meteles and drynkles. and is nerehonde overcome with werynes falls at
the last to a good Inn. and there has he mete and drink / and is well
refresshed for the time / Right so ghostly: a devout soul that wol forsake
the love of the world / and would feign love god / and settyth al his besynes
thereto: prays and traueyleth al day bodily and ghostly / and sometime feleth
no comfort ne savor in devotion / The^ our lord having pity over al his
creatures that it should not perisshe for defawte ne torn i^to heaviness or
grutchynge sends it among his ghostly food and comfort it in devotion as
he wouchith saaf / And wha^ the soul feleth any comfort then holds he him
well paid for all his traueylle and all the disease that it had on the day when
it fares well at even by feeling of any grace The self wise falls it of
other souls that are profitynge and ferforth in grace / They felen often times
gracyous towchynges of the holy ghost in her soul / both in understanding
and sight of ghostly things and in affeccy of love / But yet ben they not
reformed in felyng / ne they are not yet perfyte / for why al such felynges
come to he^ in that state as it were unwarily / for they come or they wit it /
and gooth fro hem or they wit it / And they can not come thereto again. ne wot
not where they shall find it for they have not yet homlynes with he^ of
thought and lastyng desire in Ihu^ / ne the eye of her souls is not opyned to
ye beholding of gostly things. but they nyghe fast toward / and therefore
they are not yet reformed i^ felyng / ne they have not yet ye full yeft of
conte^placio^ /

On what manner a man shall have knowing of his own soul / and how a man
should set his love in Ihu^ god and man one person. Caplm^ xxx
IT needs a soul that would have knowing of ghostly things for to have
first knowing of it self / For it may not have knowing of a kind above it
self but if it have knowing of itself / And that is when the foul is so
gadred i^ to itself / and departed fro beholdynge of al erthly things and fro
the use of bodily wits that it felyth itself as it is in the own kind
without a body / Then if thou coueyte for to know and see thy soul what it
is. thou shalt not torn thy thought with ymaginacion in to thy body for to
seek it and feel it as it were hyd within thyn heart. as thy heart is hid and
holden within thy body / If thou seek so thou shall never find it in itself
/ The more thou secheste for to find and feel it as thou would feel a bodily
thing the ferder thou art therfro / For thy soul is no body but a life
vnseable. not hyd and holden with in thy body as a less thing is hyd and
holden within a more but it is holding and quyknyng thy body much more tha^
thy body is in might and in virtue / Then if thou wolt find it withdraw thy
thought fro al bodily thing outward and fro mind of thyn own body. also
fro al thy five wits asmoche as thou may. and think on the kind of a
reasonable soul ghostly as thou would think for to know any virtue as
sothfastnes or mekenes or any other virtue / Right so think that a soul is
a life vndedely and vnseably / and has might in itself for to see and know
the soueryn sothfastenes. And for to love the souereyne goodness yt is god /
when thou see this then felyst thou somewhat of thyself / Seek thyself in none
other place / but ye more fully and ye more clerly yt thou may think of the
kind and the worthynes of a reasonable soul what it is and what is ye wyndly
werkynge of it ye better see thou thiselfe / It is full har^e for a ^oule that
is rude and much in the flesh for to have syghte and knowing of it or of an
angel or of god / It falls anon in to ymagynacion of bodily shappe. and it
weneth thereby for to have the sight of it self. and so of god and so of
ghostly things / And that may not be / For all ghostly things are seen and
known by understanding of the soul not by ymaginacion / Right as a soul
sees by understanding that the virtue of right wysnes is for to give to every
thing that it owes to have / right so and on such a manner may the soul
see itself by understanding / Nevertheless I say not that thy soul shall
rest stylle in this knowinge / bue it shall by this seek hyer knowing above
itself and that is the kind of god / For the soul is but a myrour in the
which thou shall see god ghostly / And therefore thou shall first find thy
myrrour and keep it bryghte and clean fro flesshly fylth and worldly vanytee /
and hold it well up fro the earth that thou myt see it and our lord therein
also* For to this end traueylen all chosen souls in this life in her meaning
and in her intent though they have not specially the felinge of this. And
therefore it is said before that many souls begin^yng and profiting have many
great feruours and much sweet deuocio^ and as it semith bre^nynge al in love.
and yet have they not perfytly love ne ghostly knowing of god / For wit thou
well feel a soul never somoche fervor / somoche that him thinkyth that ye
body may not bear it. or though he melte al in to weeping. aslonge as his
thynkyng and his beholding of god is most. or al in ymagynacion and not in
vndsto^dyng he come not yet to prrfyte love ne to co^te^placion / For thou
shall vndsto^de yt the love of god is on three manner wise / Al are good. but
echone is better tha^ other / The first comyth only through faith without
gracious ymaginacio^ or ghostly knowing of god / This love is in the leest
soul that is reformed in faith in ye lowest degree of charity / And it is
good: for it suffyceth to salvation: The second love is that a soul felyth
thorugh faith and ymagynacyon of Ihu^ i^ his manhede. This love is better than
the first when the ymagynacyon is styred by grace / for why the ghostly eye is
opened in beholdynge of our lords manhede / The third love that the soul
feleth thorugh ghostly sight of ye god head in the manhede as it may be seen
here / that is best and wooste worthy / and that is perfyte love this love a
soul felyth not unto it be reformed in felyng / Souls beginning and
profytyng has not this love. for they cannot think on Ihu^ ne love him goodly
but as it were almanly and flesshly after the condycyons and lyknes of man and
upon that reward they shape al her worchynge in her thoughts and in her
affeccyons / They dread him as a man and worship him and love him pryncypally
in ma^ly ymagynacyon and go no ferder / As thus: If they have done amysse and
trespased against god they think then ye god is wroth with hem as a man should
if they had trespassed against him. and therefore they fall down as it were to
the fete of our lord with sorrow of heart and cryen mercy / And when they done
thus they have a good trust y^ our lord of his mercy wol foryeue hem her
trespass / This manner of doing is right good / but it is not ghostly as it
might be / Also when they woll worship god they present hem in her thought as
they were before our lords face in a bodily lyckenes. and ymagyne a wonderful
light there our lord Ihesu is / and then they reverence him and worship him
and dread him / and fully put hem in his mercy for to do with hem what he wol /
Also wha^ they wol love god they behold him worship him and dre^e him as a
man. not yet as god in man either in his passion or in some other thing of his
manhede and in y^ beholdinge they feel her hertes much stired to that love of
god / This manner of worchynge is good and gracyous but it is much less and
lower than is the worching of understanding / That is when the soul
gracyously beholds god in man / For in our lord Ihesu are two kinds. the
manhede. and the godhede / Then right as the godhede is more souereyne and
more worthy tha^ is the manhede / Right so the ghostly beholdynge of the
godhede in Ihesu man is more worthyer. and more ghost stlyer. and more medeful
than ne beholding of the manhede alone / whether he behold the manhede as
dedly or as gloryfyed / And right so by the same skyl the love y^ a soul
felyth in thynkyng and beholdynge of the godhede in man when it is gracyously
showed is worthyer ghostlyer and more medeful than the fervor of devotion that
the soul feleth by ymagin^acyon oonly of the man: head show it never somoche
outward / For in reward of that this is but manly / for our lord shows him
not in ymaginacion as he is. ne that he is / for the soul might not that time
for freelte of the flesshhede suffer it so / Neuerthels unto such souls that
can not think of the godhede ghostly that they should not err in her
devotion. but that they should be comforted and strengthed through some manner
Inward beholdynge of Ihu^ for to forsake sin and the love of the world.
therefore our lord Ihesu tempreth his vnseable light of his godhede and
clotheth it under bodile lykenes of his manhede. and she with it unto the Inner
eye of a soul. and fedeth it with the love of his precious flesh ghostly /
The which love is of so great might that it sleeth all wicked love in the
soul and strength it for to suffer bodyly penance and other bodyly disease
in time of need / for love of Ihesu / And this is the shadowyng of our lord
Ihesu over a chosen soul. in the which shadowyng the soul is kept fro
brennyng of worldly love. For right as a shadow is made of a light and of a
bodi: right so this ghostly shadow is made of ye blessed vnseable light of the
godhede and of the manhede ooned thereto showed to a devout soul / of the
which shadow the prophet says thus / Sp^s ante facie^ nostram xp^s dn^s sub
vmbra eius viuemus inter gentes / Our lord christ before our face as a spyrite
under his shadow we shall live among folk / That is our lord Ihesu in his
godhede is a spyryte that may not be seen of us living in flesh as he is in
his blessed light. therefore we shall live under ye shadow of his manhede as long
as we are here But though this besooth yt this love in ymaginacyon be good /
Nevertheless a soul should desire for to have ghostly love in understanding of
the godhede. for that is the end and ye full bliss of the soul / and al
bodily beholdynges are but means ledynge a soul to it / I say not that we
should refuse the manhede of Ihesu and depart god fro man. but thou shall in
Ihesu man behold dread. wonder. and love ghostly the godhede. And so shall
thou without departing love god in man. and both god and man ghostly and not
flesshly / Thus taught our lord mary mawdeleyne that should be contemplatyfe.
Ioh. x
when he said thus / Noli me tangere non du^ene^ ascendi ad patre^ meu^ Touch
me not I am not yet styed up to my fader / That is to say: Mary magdalene
loved well our lord Ihesu before the time of his passion / but her love was
much bodily and lytyl ghostly / She trowed well yt he was god but she loved him
a lytyl as god / for she kouth not then^e / and therefore she suffers al her
affection and al her thought fall in him as he was in form of man / And our
lord blamed her not then but praised it much / But after when he was risen
fro death and appeared to her she would have worshypped him with such manner
love as she did before / and then our lord forbode her and said thus Towche
me not: That is. Set not thy rest ne the love of thyn heart in that form
of man y^ thon see with thy flesshly eye only for to rest therein. For in
that four me I am not styed up to my fader That is I am not eue^ to the fader.
for in that form of man I am less than he: Towche me not so. but let thy
thought and thy love in ye form in which I am even to the fader / that is ye
form of the godhede / and love me: know me. and worship me as god and man
godly. not as a man manly / So shall thou touch me. For sythen I am both god
and man and all the cause why I shall be loved and worshipped is for I am god:
and for I took the kind of man. And therefore make me god in thine heart and in
thine love / And worship me in thine understanding as Ihesu god and man:
souereyne sothfastnes and souereyne goodness and blessed life for that I am /
And thus taught our lord her as I understand and also al other souls that
arne dysposed to contemplacyon and able thereto that they should do so.
Nevertheless other souls that arne not sybtyll in kind. ne are not yet made
ghostly thoroughe grace it is good to hem that they keep for the her own
worchynge in ymagynacyon with manly affection unto more grace come freely to
hem. It is not syker to a man to lene one good thing utterly till he see and
feel a better. Upon the self wise it may be said of other manner felinges that
are like to bodyly / as herynge of delectable song. or feeling of comfortable
hete in the body: seenge of light. or swetnes of bodili savor. These are not
ghostly felynges. for ghostly clyn are felt in the myghtes of the soul /
pryncipally in understanding and love. and lytyl in ymagynacyon / But thise
felynges are felt in the myghtes of the body in ymagynacyon / and therefore
they are not ghostly felynges. But wha^ they are best and most true. yet are
they but outward tokens of the Inly grace that is felt in ye myghtes of the
soul / This may be openly preued by holy wryt saying thus / Apparueru^t
appostolis dispertitelingue ta^qm^ ignis. Act.
sed itque supra singulos eorum spiritus scu^s / The holy ghost appeared to the
apostles in the day of penthecost in the lickenes of brennynge tongues and
enflammed her hertes. and ^et upon each of hem / Now soth it is the holy ghost
that is god in himself vnseable was not that fire ne the tongues that were
seen. ne that brennyng that was felt bodily. but he was vnseabli felt in the
myghtes of her souls / for he lyghtned her reason and kyndeled her affeccion
through his blessed precense so clearly and so brennyngly that they had.
suddenly the ghostly knowing of sothfastnes and ye perfeccyon of love as our
lord behyght hem saying thus / Spiritus sanctus docebit vos omnem veritatem /
That is. Ioh.
the holy ghost shall teache you al sothfastnes / then was that fire and that
brennyng naught else but a bodily token outward showed in wy^nessynge of that
grace that was Inwardly felt / And as it was in hem / so is it in other
souls that are vysyted and lyghtned within of the holy ghost. and has with
that such outward feeling in comfort and wytnessyng of the grace inward /
But that grace is not as I hope in all souls that are perfyte but there our
lord wol / Other Inperfyte souls that have such felynges outward and have
not yet received Inward grace it is not good to hem to rest in such felynges
outward / but in as much as they help the soul to more love. and to more
stablynesse of thought in god / For some may be true and some may be feyned
as I have said before /

How this manner of speaking of refourmyng in felinge of a soul shall be take
And on what wise it is reformed and how it is found in saint poules words.
Caplm^ xxxi.
NOw I have said to the a lityll of refourmynge in faith. and also I have
towched to the a lityll of the forth going fro that refourmynge to the higher
refourmyng that is in feeling. Not in that intent that I would by these words
set goddis worchyng under a law of my spekinge. As for to say thus worcheth
god in a soul and none other wise / Nay I mean not so / But I say after my
simple felinge that our lord worcheth thus in some creatures as I hope / And
I hope well that he worcheth other wise also that passyth my wit and my
felinge / Nevertheless whether he worche thus of other wise by sundry means in
longer time or shorter time / with much traueyle or lityl traueyle / if all
come to one end. that is to the perfyte love of him / then it is good
enough / For if he wol give one soul on one day the full grace of
contemplacyon and with out any traueyle as he well may / as good is that to
that soul as if he had be examined pynyd mortyfyed and purifyed twenty winter
/ And therefore upon this manner wise take in my saying as I have said. and
na^ly as I think to say / For now by the grace of our lord Ihesu shall I
speak a little as me thinks more openly of refourmyng in feeling what it is
and how it is made. and which are ghostly felynges that a soul receives /
Nevertheless first that I take not this manner of speaking of refourmyng of a
soul in feeling as feynyng or fantasye / therefore I shall ground it in saint
poullis words where he says thus / Nolite conformari huic seculo sed
reformamini in nouitate sensus vestri / That is: To. xii
ye that are through grace reformed in faith conform you not hensforwarde to
the manners of the world in pride in couetyse and in other sins. but be ye
reformed in newehede of feeling / Loo here thou may see that saint poul
spekyth of refourmynge in felinge / And what that new felinge is. he expowneth
in a another place thus / Ut impleamini in agnicione volu^tatis eius in omni
intellectu et sapi^a spirituali / That is: we pray god that ye may be
fulfilled in knowinge of goddis will in all understanding and in all manner
ghostly wysdom / This is refourmynge in felinge / For thou shall understand
that the soul has ii. manner of felinges. One without of the five bodili
wits. a another within of the ghostly wits the which are properly the
myghtes of the soul / Mind reason and will / wha^ these myghtes are through
grace fulfilled in all understanding of the will of god and ghostly wysdo^ the^
ne has the soul new gracyous felynges / That this is soth he shows in a
another place thus / Renouamini spiritu mentis vestre and induite nouu^ hominem
qui secu^dum deum creatus est in iusticia: Col. iii
sci^tate et veritate. Be ye renewed in spirit of your soul / That is: ye
shall be reformed not in bodily feeling ne in ymaginacion but in the over
party of your reason / And clothe you in a new man that is shapen after god
in rightwysnes holiness and sothfastnesse / That is: your reason that is
properly the image of god through grace of the holy ghost shall be clothed in a
new light of sothfastnesse / holiness. and ryghtwysnes / And then it is
reformed in feeling / For when the soul has perfyte knowing of god then it
is reformed / Thus faith saint poul / Expoliantes vetere^ homine^ cu^ actibus
^uis induite nouu^ qui renouatur in angnico^ne dei scdm ymagyne^ eius qui
creauit eum / Spoil yourself of ye old man with all his deeds That is cast fro
you ye love of ye world with all worldly manners. Col. 3.
And clothe you in a new man. That is: ye shall be renewed in ye knowing of
god after ye lyckenes of him yt made you / By these words thou may understand
yt saint poul would have men's souls reformed in perfyte knowing of god. for
yt is ye now feeling yt he speaks of gernerally And therefore upon his words
I shall say more openly of this refourmyng as god yeueth me grace / For there
is two manner knowing of god One is had pryncipally in ymagynacyon. and lytyl
in understanding / This knowing is in chosen souls beginning and prouffytynge
in grace yt known god. and louen him al manly. not ghostly with manly
affeccyons and with bodily lyknes as I have before said This knowing is good.
and it is lykned to milk by yt which they are tenderly nourysshed as chyldern
until they ben able for to come to the faders board and take of his hand hole
bread. A another knowing pryncipally feled in understanding and lytyl in
ymagynacyon. For ye understanding is lady and ymagynacyon is a maiden serving
to the understanding when need is / knowing his hole bread mete for profit
souls / and it is reformed in feeling /

How god opens the Inner eye of the soul to see him not al at ones but by
diverse times / And of three manner of refourmynge of a soul by ensample.
Capitulum. xxxii
A Soul yt is called fro the love of world and after yt is ryghted and
assayed. mortifyed and puryfyed as I have before said: our lord Ihu^ of his
mercyful goodness refourmyth it in felyng when he wouchyth saaf He opens the
Inner eye of the soul when he lyghtneth ye reasn^ through towychynge and
shinynge of his blessed light for to se him and know him. not al fully at ones
but lityll and lityll by diverse times as the soul may suffer him / He sees
him not what he is. for that may no creature do in heaven ne in earth: Nor he
sees him not as he is / for that sight is oonly in the bliss of heaven But he
sees him. yt he is an vnchaungable being / a souereyne might: souereyne
sothfastenes: souereyne goodness: a blessed life: an endless bliss / This sees
ye soul and much more that comyth with al not blyndly and nakydly and
vnsauourly as does a clerk that sees him by his clergy only thorugh might
of his naked reason but he sees him in understanding that is comforted and
lyghted by the yefte of the holy ghost with a wonderful reverence and a preuy
brennyng love. and with ghostly savor and heavenly delight more clerly and more
fully tha^ it may be wryte^ or said / This syghte though it be but shortly and
lytyl is so worthy and so mighty that it draws and rauyssheth all the
affeccio^ of the soul fro beholding and the mind of al erthly thing thereto
for to rest therein evermore if it might / And of this manner of syghte and
knowing the soul groundeth al his worchyng inward in all the affeccions / For
then it dredeth god in man as sothfastnesse wondreth him as might / loves
him as goodness / This syghte and this goodness and this knowing of Ihesu with
the blessed love that comyth out of it may be called refourmyng of a soul in
feeling and in faith that I speak of /

It is in faith / For it is derke yet as in reward of that full knowing of
Ihu^ wyih the blessed love that comith onte of it yt shall be in heaven / For
then shall we se him not oonly yt he is but as he is / As saint John^ says /
Tunc videbimus eum sicut est / That is: p^. Io. iiii.
Then shall we see him as he is / Nevertheless it is in feeling also as in
reward of ye blind knowing that a soul has stondynge oonly in faith / For
this soul knowyth somewhat of the very kind of Ihesu god thorughe his gracyous
sight / but ye other knowyth not. but oonly trowith it is soth. Nevertheless yt
thou ye better may conceive what I mean I shall show these three manner
refourmyng of a soul by ensample of three men stondyng inlyt of the son Of the
which three one is blind a another may see but he has his eyes stopped / the
third lokyth forth full sight / The blind man has no manner knowing that he
is in the son^e / but he trowith it if a true man tell him And he betokens a
soul that is oonly reformed in faith yt trowyth in god as holy church
techeth and wot not what / This suffyceth as for salvation / That other man
sees a light of the son. but he sees it not clerly what it is for the lyd
of his eye lets him that he may not see / But he sees thorugh the lyd of
his eye a glymerynge of great light / And he betokens a soul that is
reformed in faith and in feeling / and so is he contemplatyfe. For he sees
some what of the godhede of Ihesu thoroughe grace / Not clerly ne fully. for
the lydde that is his bodyly kind is yet a wall bytwyxe his kind and the
kind of Ihesu god and lettythe him from the clear syghte / But he sees
thoroughe this wall after that grace towchyth him more or less that Ihesu is
god. and that Ihesu is souereyne good nesse and souereyne being. and a blessed
life / and all that other goodness comyth of him / Thus seethe the soul by
grace notayenstondynge the bodily kind. and the more clean and subtyl that the
soul is made. and ye more it is depared fro flesshly head the sharper sight it
has and the myghtyer love of the godhede of Ihesu / This sight is so mighty
that though none other man living would trow in Ihesu ne love him he would
never trow the less ne love him the less for he sees it sothfastly that he
may not vntrowe it / The third man yt has full sight of the son he trowith
it not / for he seeyth it fully / And he betokens a full blessed soul that
without any wall of body or of sin sees openly the face of Ihesu in the
bliss of heaven / There is no faith / and therefore he is fully reformed in
feeling / There is no state above the second refourmyng that a soul may come
to here in this life. for this is the state of perfeccyon and the way to heaven
ward. Nevertheless al ye souls that are in this state are not al like
ferforth. For some has it lytyl shortly and seeldom. and some longer clerer
and oftiner: and some has it best clerest and lengest after ye aboundyng of
grace / and yet al these have the yefte of contemplacion / For the soul has
not perfyte sight of Ihesu al at ones / but first a lytyl and a lytyl / and
after yt it profyteth and comyth to more felyng / And aslonge as it is in this
life it may wax more in knowing and in this love of Ihesu / and sothly I wot
not what were more leyf to such a soul that has felt a lytyl of it than
utterly al other things left and set at naught. Tent only thereto for to
have clerer sight and clenner love of Ihesu in who^ is all the blessed trynyte /
This manner knowing of Ihesu as I understand is the opening of he^en to the
eye of a clean soul of the which holy me^ speak of in her writing / Not as
some wene that the opening of heaven is as if a soul might see by ymaginacio^
through the scyes above the fyrmament how our lord Ihesu syeteth in his mageste
in a bodily light as much as an hundredth sons Nay it is not so. ne though
he see never so high on that manner sothly he sees not the gostly heaven / The
higher he styeth above the son for to see Ihesu god so by such ymagynacio^
the lower he falls bineth the son. Nevertheless this manner sight is
sufferable to si^ple souls that can no better seche him that is vnseable.

How Ihu^ is heaven to the soul. And why he is called fire / Caplm. xxxiii.
WHat is heaven to a reasonable soul / Sothly naught else but Ihesu god / For
if that be heaven only that is above al thing / then ne is god only heaven to
man's soul for he is only above the ki^de of a soul / then if a soul may
thorugh grace have knowing of ye blessed kind of Ihesu sothly he sees heaven
for he sees god / Therefore there are many men that erren in understanding of
some words that are said of god / for they understand them not gostly / Holy
writing says that a soul that woll find god shall lift upward the Inner
eye and seek god above itself / Then some me^ that would do after this
saying understood this word above hemself as for higher setting instead
and worthynes of place as one elemente or planete is above a another in settyne
and worthynes of a bodily place / But it is not so gostly. For a soul is
above al bodily thing that by setting of stead: but by subtyltee and
worthynes of kind / Right so on the self wise god is above all bodily and
gostly creatures not by setting of stead but by subtyltee and worthynes of his
unchangeable blessed kind. And therefore he that wol wisely see he god and
find him he shall not run out with his thought as he would clyme above the
son and part the firmament and ymagyn that mageste as it were of an hundred
sons / he shall rather draw down the son and all the fyrmame^t and forget
it. and cast it beneth him there he is. and set all and all bodily thing
also at naught / And think then if he can ghostly both of him self and of
god also / And if he do thus: then sees the soul above it self / then
sees it in to heaven. Upon this self manner shall this word within be
understand / It is comynly said that a soul shall see our lord within all
thing and within itself / Soth it is yt our lord is within all creatures /
but not on that manner yt a kernel is hyd within the shell of a nutte. or as a
little bodily thing is holdon within a another much / but he is within all
creatures as holding and keeping hem in her being through subtyltee and might
of his own blessed kind and clennes vnseable / For right as a thing that is
most precious and most clean is laid nerest / Right so by that lyknes it is
said that the kind of god that is most precious most clean and most goodly
ferrest fro bodily head is hid within al things / And therefore he that woll
seek god within he shall forgete first all bodily things for all that is with
out. and his own body / and he shall forgete thi^kynge of his own soul. and
think on the unmade kind. that is Ihesu yt made him: quiknith him. holdith
him and yeueth him reason and mind and love the which is within him through
his might and souereyne subtylte / Upon this manner shall the soul do when
grace towchyth it. or else it woll but little avail to se^he Ihesu. And to
find him within it self and within al creatures as me thi^kyth / Also it is
said in holy write that god is light / So says saint John^. p^. Iohi^s
Deus lux i^ That is. God is light / This light shall not be understand as
for bodily light. but it is understand thus / God is light. That is. God is
troth ang sothfastnes for sothfastnes is ghostly light / Then he that most
gracyously knowyth sothfastnes best sees god / and nevertheless it is lykened
to the bodily light for this skill Right as the son shows to the bodily eye
itself and all bodily thing by it / rihht so sothfastnes that is god shows
to the reason of the soul itself first. and by itself al other gostly
thing that needs to ye knowing of a soul / Thus says the prophet / Domine
in lumine tuo videbimus iume^ / Lord we shall see thy light by thy light /
That is: p^. xxxv.
we shall see the that art sothfastnes by thyselfe / On the self wise it is
said that god is fire / Deus nost ignis consumens est: Hebr^. xii.
That is. Our lord is fire wasting / That is for to say. God is not fire
elementare that heteth a body and bre^neth it. but god is love and charity /
For as fire wasted all bodily thing yt may be wasted / Right so ye love of
god bre^neth and wastes all sin out of the soul. And makes it clean as
fire makyth clean all manner metalle / These words and all other that arne
spoken of our lord in holy writ by bodily lyckenesse must needs be
understand ghostly. Else there is no savor in hem / Nevertheless the cause
why such manner words are said of our lord in holy writ is this / For we
are so flesshly that we can not speak of god ne understand of him but if we by
such words first be entered in / Nevertheless when the Inner eye is opened
through grace for to have a little sight of Ihesu / Then shall the soul torn
lightly enough all such words ye which of bodily things in to ghostly
understanding. This ghostly opening of the Inner eye in to knowing of the
godhede which I call refournynge in faith and feeling / For then the soul
the which somewhat feleth in understanding of that thing which yt it had
before in naked trowynge. and that is the begyn^yng^ of contemplacio^ / of the
which saint poul says thus / Non conte^pla^tibm nobis q^ vide^tur sed q^ non
vide^tu^ Quia que videntur temporalia sunt. que autem non videntur eterna sunt
/ That is: S. little iiii.
Our contemplacio^ is not in things that are seen. but it is in things
vnseable / For things that are seen are passing. but vnseable things are
everlasting / to the which syghte every soul should desire for to come to
both here in party and in the bliss of heaven fully / For in that sight and in
that knowing of Ihu^ is fully the bliss of a reasonable soul and endless life
Thus says our lord / Hec est autem vita eterna vt cognoscant te verum deum and
quem misisti Ihesu^ xp^m / That is: John^ vii.
Fader this is endless life yt thy chosen souls know the and thy sone whom
thou haste sent one sothfaste god.

Of two manner of love reformed and vnfourmed what it meanith / And how we be
behold to love Ihesu much for our making / but more for our again byeng / but
althermooste for our saving through ye yeftes of his love. Caplm. xxxiiii.
BUt now wondrest thou sythen this knoweng of god is the bliss and ye end of
a soul? why then have I said here before that a soul should not else
coueyte but oonly the love of god / I spoke no thing of this sight yt a soul
should coueyte this / Unto this may I say thus / that the sight of Ihesu is
full bliss of a soul: and that is oonly for the light but it is also for the
blyssed love that comith out of that sight / Nevertheless for love comyth out of
knowing and not knowing out of love / therefore it is said that in knowing
and in sight pryncipally of god with love is the bliss of a soul and the more
he is known the better he is loved. But for asmoche as to this knowing or to
this ^oue that comith of it. may not the soul come without ^oue / therefore
said I that thou sholdest coueyte love / ^or love is cause why a soul comyth
to this knowing and to this love that comith of it / And on what man^ that is I
shall tell the more openly. Holy writers saye^ ^ soth it is that there is two
manner of gostly love / One ^s called fourmed. a another is called vnfourmed /

Love vnfourmed is god him self the third perso^e in trynyte that is the holy
ghost / He is love vnfour^ed and unmade as saint Io. says / Deus dilecco^ est /
God ^s love: p^. Io. iiii.
That is the holy ghost / Love fourmed is the affeccio^ of the soul made by the
holy ghost of the syghte and of the knowing of sothfastnes that is god. oonly
tired and set in him / This love is called fourmed ^or it is made by the holy
ghost / This love is not god ^n himself for it is made. but it is the love of
the soul ^ellte of the sight of Ihesu and stired to him oonly / Now ^ay thou
see that love formed is not cause why a sou^e comyth to ye ghostly syghte of
Ihesu / And some men would think that they would love god so bre^nyngly as it
were by their own might. that they were worthy for to have the ghostly
knowing of him / Nay it is not so. But love un unformed that is god himself
is cause of all this knowing / For a blind wretched soul is so far fro the
clear knowing and the blessed feeling of his love thorugh sin and freelte of
the bodily kind that it might never come to it. ne were it ye endless mochenes
of the love of god. But then by cause he loves us so much therefore he
yeueth us his love that is the holy ghost / He is the yeuer and the yeft. and
makes us then by that yefte for to know and love him / Lo this the love
that I spoke of that thou sholdest oonly coueyte and dysyre this vnfourmed love
that is the holy ghost / For sothly a less thing or a less yefte than he is
may not avail us for to bring us to the blessed sight of Ihu^ / And therefore
should we fully desire and ask of Ihesu oonly this yeft of love yt he would
for the mochenes of his love so blessed touch our heart with his vnseable
light to the knowing of him and depart with us of his love yt as he loves
us that we might love him again / Thus says saint John^ / Nos diligamus deum
qm^ ipse prior dilexit nos That is: ^. John^.
Love we god now for he first loves us / He loved us much when he made us to
his lyknes. But he loved us more when he bought us with his precious blood
through wylfull taking of death in his man head fro the power of the fend and
fro the pyne of hell but he loves us most when he yeueth us the yefte of the
holy ghost that is love. be yt which we know him and love him. and are made
syker that we are his sons chosen to salvation / For this love are we more to
him bound tha^ for any other love that ever showed he for us. either in our
making or in our ayenbyenge / For though he had made us and bought us: but if
he save us with all? what profyteth it else to us our making or our byenge /
Sothly right naught / Therfo^ the most token of love showed to us as me
thinks is this / That he yeueth himself in his manhood to ou^ souls / He
gaaf him self first in his ma^hede to ^e for our Raunson when he offered
himself to the fader of heaven upon the awter of the cross

This was a right fair yefte and a right great token of love / But what time
he gives himself in his godhege ghostly to our souls for our salvation / And
makes us for to know him. and for to love him / Then louyth he us fully /
For then yeueth he himself to us / And more might he not give us / Ne less
might not suffyce to us /

And for this skylle it is said that the ryghtynge of a sinful soul thorugh
foryeuenesse of sins is are^ted and appropered pryncypally to the worchynge
of the holy ghost / For the holy ghost is love / And in the ryghtynge of a
soul our lord Ihesu shows to a soul most of his love / For he does away
all sin and ^onyth it to him / And that is the best thing that he may do
to a soul / And therefore it is appropred to the holy ghost / The making of
the soul is appropred to the fader. as for the souereyne might and power yt
he shewyth in making of it / The byenge of it is aretted to the sone as for
the souereyne wit and wisdom that he showed in his manhede / For he overcome
the fe^de pryncypally through wisdom and not through strenghte / But the
ryghtynge and the full saving of a soul by foryeuenesse of sins is
approprede to the third person that is the holy ghost / For therein shows
Ihesu most love unto man's soul / And for that chynge shall he be most
loved of us again / His making is comen to us and to all unreasonable creatures
/ For as he made us of naught* so made he hem And therefore is this work
greteste of might. but not most of love / Also the byenge is comen to us and
to all reasonable souls / as to Jews and saracyns and to falls christian men /
For he deyed for all souls ylyke / and bought hem. if they woll have the
perfyte love of it / and also it suffyceth for the bienge of al though it be so
that al have it not / And this work was most of wisdom not most of love / But
the ryghtynge and the halowynge of our souls through the yefte of the holy
ghost. that is oonly in that worchynge of love. And that is not comen to all
but it is a special gift oonly to them which be chosen souls / And sothly
that is most worchynge of love to us that are his chosen chylderne. This is
the love of god that I spoke of which thou should coueyte and desire: for this
love is god himself and ye holy ghost This love unformed wha^ it is yeue^ to us
it wor^heth in our soul all ye good is and all ye longs to godenes / This
love loves us or that we love him for it cle^seth us first of our sins: and
makes us for to love him. and makes our will strong for to ayenstond all
sins / and styreth us for to assaye our self through diverse exercise both
bodily and gostly in all virtues / It stireth us also for to forsake the sin
and flesshly affeccions and worldly dredes / It keeps us fro malycyous
temptacions of the fend. and dryueth us out fro besynes and vanyte of the
world. and fro conversation of worldly lovers / All this does the love of god
unformed wha^ he yeueth himself to us / we do right naught but suffer him and
assente to him. for that is the most that we do that we assente wylfully to
his gracyous worchynge in us / and yet is not that will of us but of his
making. so that me thinks that he does in v^ all that is well done. and yet
see we it not / And not oonly does he thus. but after this love does more.
for he opens the eye of the soul. and shewith to ye soul that sight of
Ihesu wonderfully. and the k^owynge of him as the soul may suffer it thus by
little and by little. and by that syghte he rauyssheth all the affeccion of the
soul to him and then begins the soul for to know him ghostly and
brynnyngly for to love him / Thi^^ne sees the soul somewhat of the kind of
the blessed godhede of Ihesu how that he is all and that he worcheth all. and
that all good deeds the which are done and good thouhtes are oonly of him for
he is all seuereyn might and all souerei^ sothfastnes and al souerein godnes /
and therefore every good deed is done of him and by him and he shall oonly have
the worship and the thank for all good deeds and no thing but he / For
though wretched me^ stele his worchypp here for a while / Nevertheless at the
last end shall sothfastnesse show well that Ihesu did all. And man did
right uoughte of him self / And then shall thieves of gods that are not
acorded with him here in this life for her trespaas be demyd to death and Ihu^
shall be fully worshipped and thanked of al blessed creatures for his worchynge
/ This love is not else but Ihesu himself that for love worcheth all this i^
man's soul. and refourmeth it i^ feeling to his lykenes as I have before said
and somewhat as I shall say / This love brings in to the soul the full head
of all virtues and makyth al clean and true soft and easy. and torneth him al
in to love and in to likynge / And on what manner wise he does that: I shall
tell the a little after ward / This love drawyth the soul fro vain
beholdynge of worldly things in to contemplacyon of ghostly creatures and of
goddis pryuites / fro flesshlihede in to ghostlynes / fro erthly feeling in to
heavenly savor /

How that some soul loves Ihu^ by bodily feruours and by her own manly
affeccions that been styred by grace and by reason / And how some louen Ihesu
more rest fully by ghostly affeccyons oonly styred Inward through specially
grace of the holy ghost. Capitulum xxxv.
Then may I say that he that most ha^h of this love here in this life most
pleseth god. and most clear sight shall have of him / and most fully love him
in the bliss of heaven / for he has the most yeft of love here in earth / This
love may not be had by a man's own traueyle as some wene / It is freely had
of the gracyous yefte of Ihesu after much bodyly and ghostly traueyle going
before For there are some lovers of god yt maken himself to love god as it were
by her own might / for they streyne hemself through great vyolence and panten
so strongly that they brast in to bodily feruours as they would draw down god
fro heaven to hem / And they sayen in her hertes and with her mouth / A lord I
love the and I would love the: I would for thy love suffer death / And in this
manner of worchynge they feel great fervor and much grace / And soth it is me
thinks this worchynge is good and medfully if it be well tempred with mekenes
and with dyscrecion / But nevertheless these me^ love not ne have not the yefte
of love on that manner as I speak of: ne they ask it not so / For a soul that
has the yeft of love through gracyous beholding of Ihu^ as I mean or else if
be have it not yet / but would have it. he is not besy for to strain himself
over his might as it were by bodyly strength for to have it by bodyly
feruours: and so for to feel the love of god but him thinks that he is right
naught. and that he can do right naught of himself. but as it were a deed
thing oonly hangyng and borne up by the mercy of god / He sees well that Ihu^
is al and does all. and therefore asks he naught else but the yefte of love
/

Horly the^ that the soul seth that his own love is naught therefore it would
have his love for that is enough / Therefore prays he and that desires he
that the love of god would towche him with his blessed light that he might
see a little of him by his gracyous presence: for then should he love him / And
so by this way comyth the yefte of love that is god in to a soul / The more
that a soul nough yth itself thorugh grace by sight of his sothfastnes some
time without any fervor outward showed. and the less yt it thynkith that it
loves or sees god. the nerer it nygheth for to precyu^e the yefte of the
blessed love / For then is love master and worcheth in the soul: and makes
it forgete itself. and for to se and behold only how love does / And then is
ye soul more suffrynge than doing. and that is clean love / Thus saint poul
meaned when he said thus. To viii
Quicu^que sp^u dei agunt hii filii dei sunt / All thise that are wrought with
the spyryte of god are gods sons. yt is souls yt are made so meke and so
buxom^ to god that they work not of hemself. but suffer ye holy ghost styre
hem and worche hem in the felynges of love with a sweet cord to his styrynges
/ These arn specially godd is sons most like unto him. Other souls that can
not love thus buttraueylen he^self by her own afflyccyo^s and styre hy^self
through her own thinking of god and bodyly exercise for to draw out of
he^self by mastry ye feli^g of love by feruours and other bodily signs love
not ghostly / they done well and medful if so yt they wol know ^^ekly yt her
werching is not ye kyndly gracyous felyng of love. but it is manly doing by a
soul at ye byddyng of reason / and nevertheless through ye godenes of god by
cause yt the soul does y^ in it is. these ma^ly offecco^ns of ye soul styred
in to god by man's werchyng are ^orned in to ghostly affeccyons. and are
mede^ulas if they had he done ghostly in the first beginning / And this is a
great curtesye of our lord showed to meke souls that torneth all these manly
affeccyons of kyndely love in to the affection and in to the mede of his own
love: As if he had wroughte him all fully by himself / And so these manly
affeccyons so turned may be called affeccyons of ghostely love thoroughe
purchase not thoroughe kyndely bringing fourth of the holy ghost / I say
not that a soul may worche such manly affeccyons oonly of itself without
grace / for I wot well that saint paul says that we may right naught done
think that good is of ourself without grace Non en^iqd sumus sufficientes
cogitare aliquid ex nobis qua si ex nobis. ^ little 3
sed sufficiencia n^a ex deo est / That is* we ye love god wene not yt we
suffyse for to love or for to think good of ourselfe oonly / but our
suffysynge is of god / For god worcheth in all both good work and good will as
saint poul says / Deus est qui eperatur in nobis et velle and perficere
probona voluntate / That is: Phil. ^
It is god that worcheth in us good will and fulfyllynge of good will / But I
say that such affection are good made by the will and mean of a soul after
the general grace that ^e yeueth to al chosen souls / not of specyal grace
made ghostly by towchynge of his gracyous presence as he worcheth in his
perfyte lovers as I said before / for ^n imperfect lovers love worcheth ferly
by the affeccyons of man. but inperfyte lovers love worchyth nerely by her own
ghostly affeccyons: and sleeth in a soul for ye time al other affeccyons both
flesshly kyndly and manly. and yt is propeely the werchynge of love by himself
/ Thus love may be had in a lytyl in party here in a clean soul through ye
ghostly sight of Ihu^. but in ye bliss of heaven it is fulfilled by clear
syghte of his godhede / For there shall none affection be feled in a soul but
godly and ghostly /

That the yefte of love among al other yeftes of Ihu^ is worthyest and most
profitable / And how Ihu^ does all that is weldone in his lovers only for love.
And how love makyth the using of al virtues and all good deeds light and easy
/ Caplm^ xxxvi
Ask thou then of god no thing but this yeft of love that is the holy ghost /
For among al ye yeftes ye our lord yeueth there is none so good ne so
profitable. so worthy ne so excellent as this is / For there is no yefte of god
that is both the yeuer and ye yefte but this yefte of love / And therefore it
is the best and the worthy est / The yefte of prophecye the yeftes of miracles
worchyng. the yefte of the great knowing and cou^selynge. and the yefte of
great fasting or of great penance doing: or any other such are great yeftes
of the holy ghost. but they are not the holy ghost / For a reproved soul and a
dampnable might have al thise yeftes as has a chose^ soul / And therefore al
thise manner yeftes are not greatly for to desire ne much for to charge / But
the yefte of love is the holy ghost god himself. And him may no soul have and
be dampened with al / For that yefte saves it only fro dampnacyon. and makyth
it goddis sone perceyuer of heavenly heritage / And that love as I have before
said is not the affection of love that is formed in a soul: but it is the holy
ghost himself that is love vnfourmed yt saves a soul / For he yeueth
himself to a soul first or the soul louith him / and he fourmeth ye affection
in ye soul: and makes the soul for to love him oonly for himself / And not
only that: but also by this yefte the soul loves itself and al his
euencryste^ as itself only for god / and this is the yefte of love that makith
shedinge atwyx chosen souls and reproved / And this yefte makyth fully pees
atwyxe god and a soul. and only al blessed creatures holy in god for it
makyth Ihu^ for to love us and us him also / And every each of us for to love
other in him / Coueyte this yefte of love pryncypally as I have said / For if
he woll of his grace give it the on that manner wise it shall open and lyghte^
the reason of thy soul for to see sothfastnes yt is god and ghostly things /
And it shall styre thyn affecco^n holy for to see sothfastnes yt is god and
ghostly things / And it shall styre thyn affeccion holy and fully for to love
him / and it shall worche in thy soul oonly as he wol. and thou shall behold
Ihu^ reverently with softnes of love and see how he does. Thus byddeth he by
his prophet that we should do saying thus / Uacate et videte qm^ ego su^deus
/ Cease ye and sees ye I am god / That is. ye y^ are reformed in feeling and
have your In^er eye opened in to sit of ghostly things cease ye some time of
outward worchyng and see yt I am god / That is: See only how I Ihu^ god and
man do / Behold you me for I do al / I am love: and for love I do al yt I do:
and ye do naught / And yt this is sooth I shall show you / For there is no
good deed done by you: ne good thought felt in you: but if it be done through
me / That is. Through might and wisdom. and love my gho^ly. wyttely and lovely
/ Else it is no good deed / But now is it soth y^ I Ihu^ am both might and
wisdom and blessed love and ye naught: for I am god / Then mow ye wel^e that
I do al your good deeds / And al good though see: and al your good loves in
you: and ye do right naught / And yet nevertheless ben al these good deeds
called yours / Not for ye worth hem pryncypally. but for I give he^ to you for
love that I have to you / And therefore sythen I y^ am Ihesu and for love does
all this. cease then ye of the beholdynge of yourselfe: and set yourselfe at
naught and look on me. and see that I am god for I do all this This is somewhat
of the meaning of the verse of dauyd before said / See then and behold what
love wercheth in a chosen soul that he refourmeth in feeling to his lykenes
when ye reason slyghtned a lytyl to ye ghostly knowing of Ihu^. and to ye
feeling of his love / Then brings love in to the soul the full head of
virtues. and torneth him al into softnes and in to liking as it were with out
worchynge of the soul: for the soul stryueth not much for the getynge of hem
as it did before. but it has hem easily and felyth hem restfully oonly
thorughe the yefte of love that is the holy ghost / And that is a well great
comfort and gladness unspeakable when it felyth suddenly and wot never how the
virtue of meekness and pacyence soberte and sadness chastyte and clennes
louered to his even christian. and al other virtues the which we^e to him
sometime traueylous paynful and hard for to keep are now turned into softnes
and lykyng and in to wonderful lyghtnes: so ferforthe that him thynkith no
maystrine no hardness for to keep every virtue but it is most lykyng to him for
to keep it: and all this makyth love

Other men that stonden in the comoetee of charity and arne not yet so
ferforthe in grace. But worche under the bidding of reason they stryuen and
fyghten al day ayenste sins for the getynge of virtues: and sometime they
ben above and sometime bynethe as wrast lees are / These men done full well /
They have virtues in reason and will. not in savor ne in lone: for they fyghten
with hemselfe as it were by her own might for hem / And therefore may they not
have full rest ne fully the hyer hand / Nevertheless they shall have much
mede: but they are not yet m^ke enough / They have not yet put hemselfe al
fully in goddys hand: for they see him not yet / But a soul that has ghostly
sight of Ihesu takethe no great keep of stryuynge for virtues for that time /
He is not besy abowte hem specially but he sets all his business for to
keep that syghte and that beholding of Ihesu that it has for to hold the
mind stably thereto / And bind the love oonly to it that it fall not therfro:
and forgete all other things asmoche as it may / And when it does thus
then is Ihesu sothfastly master again all sins / And bishado with it with
his blessed presence and getyth it all virtues / And the soul is so comforted
and so borne up with the soft feeling of love that it has of the syghte of
Ihu^ that it feleth no great disease outward / And thus sleeth love generally
alsynnes in a soul: and reformeth it in the new felynges of virtues /

How love through gracyous beholding of Ihu^ sleeth al styrynges of pride: and
makes y^ soul for to lose savor and delight in all erthly worship / Caplm^
xxxvii.
Nevertheless how love sleeth sins and refourme: th virtues in a soul more
specially shall I say and first of pride and of meknes that it contrary virtue
thereto / Thou shall understand that there is two manner of mekenes / One is had
by worchyng of reason / Another is felt of the specyal yeft of love / Both
are of love. but that one love worcheth by reason of the soul. but that other
he worcheth by himself / The first is imperfect. ye other is perfyte / The
first mekenes that a man feleth of beholding of his own sins and of his
own wretchidnes through the which beholding he thinks him self unworthy for
to have any yefte of grace or any mede of god. But him thinks it enough that
he would of his great mercy grant him foryeuenesse of his sins / And also he
thinks him by cause of his own sins that he is worse than the most sinner
that lives / and that every man does better than he / and so by such
beholdynge thresteth he himself down in his thought under al men / And he is
besy for to ayenstonde the styrynge of pride asmoche as he may both bodyly
pride and ghostly. and dyspiseth himself so that he assenteth not to the
felynges of pride / And if his heart be taken sometime with it that it be
de^oyled with vain Joy of worship or of cunnyng or of praysyng or of any
other thing / as soon as he may perceive it he is evil paid with himself and
has sorrow for it in heart and asks foryeuenes of it of god. and she with him
to his confessor. and accuses himself mekely. and receives his penance /
This is good meknes. but it is not yet perfyte mekenes for it is of souls y^
are beginning and profytyng in grace caused of beholdynge of sins / Love
worchyth this meknes by reason of the soul / Perfyte mekenes a soul feleth of
ye syghte and the ghostly knowing of Ihu^ / For when the holy ghost lyghtneth
the reason in to the sight of soth fastnes how Ihu^ is al and that he does al /
the soul has so great love and so great Joy in that ghostly sight / for it
is so soth fast that it foryeteth itself. and fully leneth to Ihu^ with all ye
love that it has for to behold him / It takith no keep of no unworthiness of
itself ne of sins before done / but sets at naught itself with all the
sins and al ye good deeds that ever it did. as if there were no thing but
Ihu^ Thus meke dauyd was when he said thus / Et sebsta^cia mea tanqm^ nichilu^
an^ te / That is: P.C xxxviii
Lord Ihesu the sight of thy blessed unmade substance and thyn endless being
shows well unto me that my substance and being of my soul is as naught
anence y^ / Also anence his eue^ christian he has no reward to hem ne demynge
of hem whether they ben better or worse than himself is / For he hold himself
and al other men as it were even ylike naught of he^self anence god. and that
is soth. For all the goodness y^ is done in hamselef or in he^ is only of god
who^ he beholds as al / And therefore sets he al other creatures at naught
as he does himself: Isay. ^
Thus meke was the prophet when he said thus / Om^es gentes quasi non sintsic
sunt coram eo et quasi nichilu^ and mane reputate sunt e^ / Al men are before
our lord as naught. and as vunotefull and naught they are a counted to him /
That is anentes the endeles being and the vnchaungable kind of god mankind
is as naught / For of naught ^^^^^ade and to naught should it torn but if
he kep^e it in the being that made it of naught / This is sothfastnesse and
this should make a soul meke if it might see thorughe grace this sothfastnesse
/ Therefore when love opens the Inner eye of the soul for to see this
sothfastnesse with other cyrcumstaunces that comen with al then begins the
soul for to be sothfastly meke / For then by the syghte of god it felyth and
sees itself as it is / And then forsakyth the soul the beholdynge and the
lenynge to itself: and fully fallith to the beholdinge of Ihesu / And when it
does so. then settyth the soul naught by all the Joy and the worship of
the world / For the Joy of worldly worship is so lytyl and so naught in
reward of that Joy and that lone that it felith in the ghostly syghte of
Ihesu and knowing of sothfastnes. that though it might have it without any
sin he would naught of it / Ne though me^ would worship him praise him and
favor him. or set him at grette state it lykyth him naught / Ne though he
had cunning of all the vii. arts of clergy and of all crafts under the
son: or had power for to work al manner miracles. he has no more deynte of
all this ne: more savor of hem than to gnawe on a dry stycke He had well lever
forgete all this and for to be al one out of the sight of the world than for to
think on hem and be worshypped of al men / For the heart of a true lover of
Ihesu is made somoche and so large through a lytyl sight of him and a lytyl
feeling of his ghostly love that all the liking and all the Joy of al earth may
not suffyce for to fill a corner of it / And then semyth it well that tbyse
wretched worldly lovers that arne as it were rauysshed in love of her own
worsyhppe / And pourse we after it for to have it with all the might and all
the wit they that have / they have no savor in this mek^nes / they are
wonder far therfro. But the (...) of Ihesu has this mekenes lastyngly. And
that not with heaviness and striuynge for it / but with likynge and gladness. The
which gladness it has not. for it forsakyth the worship of the world / for
that were a proud mekenes that longs to an ypocryte / but for he has a
syghte and a ghostly knowing of sothfastnesse and worthynes of Ihesu through
the yefte of the holy ghost / That reuerente sight and that lovely beholding
of Ihesu comfort the love so wonderfully and bears it up so myghtyly and
so softly sothly that it may not like ne fully rest in none erthly Joy. ne it
wol not / He makith none force whether men lack him or praise him / worship
him or dispyse him as for himself / He settyth it not at heart neither for to
be well paid if men despise him as for more mekenes. Ne for to be evil paid
that men should worship him or payse him / He had lever for to foryete both
that one and that other: And oonly think on Ihesu and get mekenes by that
way / And that is much the lykerer way who might come thereto / Thus did
david when he said / P. xiiii
O cul^ mei semper ad dn^^ quoniam ipse euelle^ de laqueo pedes meos / That is
/ Mine eyes are ever open to Ihesu our lord for why: he shall pluck my fete fro
snares of sins / For when he does so then forsakyth he utterly himself and
vndercastyth him holy to Ihesu / and then is he in a syker ward for the
sheelde of sothfastnes the which he holds keeps him so well that he shall not
be hurt thorughe no styrynge of pride as long as he holds him within the
sheelde as the prophet says / Scuto circundabit te verytas eius no^ c^^ebis a
timore noc^uruo. P. x.
Soch fastnes shall vmbyclyppe the with a sheelde. and that is if thou al other
things left oonly behold him / For theu shall thou not dread for the nyghtes
dread. That is: thon shall not dread the spyryte of pride whether he come by
night or by day as the next verse says after thus / A sagitta volante in
die / P. x.
Pride comyth by night for to assail a soul when it is dispysed and repreued
of other men that it should by that fall in heaviness and in to sorrow It comyth
also as an arowe fleinge on the day when a man is worshypped and praised of al
men. whether it be for worldly dooynge or for ghostly that he should have vain
Joy in himself restyngly. and falls gladness in a passinge thing / This is a
sharp arowe and a paryllous / It flees swyftly. and it stryketh softly. but
it wou^deth dedely / But the lover of Ihu^ that stabli beholds by devout
prayers and besy thinking on him is so vmbylapped with the syker sheelde of
sothfastnes that he dredeth not: for this arrowe may not enter in to the soul
/ Ne though it come it hurts not: but glenteth a way and passes forth /
And thus is the soul made meke as I understand by the worchynge of the holy
ghost that is ye gift of love / For he opens the eye of the soul for to see
and love Ihesu / And he kepyth the soul in that sight restfully and sykerly /
And helleeth all the styrynges of pride wonderfully and pryuely and softly: and
the soul wot never how / And also he brings in by that way sothfastly and
only the virtue of meekness / All this does love. but not in all his lovers
ylyke full / For some has this grace but shortly and lytyl as it were in the
beginning of it. and a lytyl assayenge toward for the conscience is not yet
cle^sed fully through grace / and some have it more fully. for they have clerer
sight of Ihesu. and they feel more of his love / And some has it most fully.
for they have the full yefte of contemplocyon / Nevertheless he that leest has
on this manner I have said. I hope so thly he has the yeft of perfyte mekenes.
for he has the yeft of perfyte love /

How love sleeth al styrynges of wrath and envy softly and refourmeth in the
soul the virtues of pees and pac^ce and of perfyte charity to his even christian
as he did specially in the appostles. Caplm^ xxxviii
Love worcheth wisely and softly in a soul there he wol for he sleeth myghtyly
ire and envy and al passions of angrynes and malencoly in it. and brings in
to the soul virtues of pacyence and myldenes peasybilyte and louered to his
euencrysten / It is full hard and a great maystry to a man that stondeth oonly
in worchynge of his own reason for to keep pacyence holy reest and softnes in
heart and charity to his even christian if they disease him vnskylfully and done
him wrong that he ne shall somewhat do again to hem thorugh styrynge of ire or of
malencolye either in speaking or in worchyng or both / And nevertheless though
a man be styred and trowbled ^u himself and made vnrestful. be so that it be
not to moch^ passing over the bonds of reason. and that he keep his hand and
his tongue and be ready for to foryeue the trespase when mercy is asked / yet
this man has ye virtue of pacyence though it be but weyke and nakydly. for as
much as he would have it and traueyleth besyly in refreynynge of his vnskylful
passions that he myt hane it / and also is sorry that he has it not as he
should / But to a true lover of Ihesu it is no great maystry for to suffer al
^his / For why love fyghteth for him and sleeth wonder softly such styrynges
of wrath and of malencoly. and makyth his soul so easily and so peasyble so
sufferynge and so goodly thorugh the ghostly sight of Ihu^ with the felyng of
his blessed love ye though he be despised and repreued of other men: or take
wrong or harm shame or vylany he charge it he is not much styred ayenste
him / He wol not be angered ne styred against him. for if he were much styred he
should forbere the comfort yt he felythe within his soul. but ye wol he not /
He may lyghtlyer forgete all the wrong that is done to him than a another man
may foryeue it though mercy were axed And so he had well lever forgete it. for
him thynkyth it most easy to him / And love does all this. for love openyth the
eye of the soul to the sight of Ihesu. and stablyth it with the liking of
love that it feleth by that sight: and comfort it so myghtely that it takes
no keep what so men Iangle or done eyenst him / It hangs no thing upon him
/ The most harm that he might have were a forberynge of ye ghostly sight of
Ihu^ / And therefore it is lever to him for to suffer al harms than that alone
All this may the soul do well and easily without great trowblynge of the
ghostly sight when disease falls al without forth and towcheth not the body.
as is bacbytyng or scornynge: or spoylynge of such as he has / Al thise
greueth naught / But it gooth so^what nerer wha^ the flesh is towched and he
feleth smerte. then it is harder Nevertheless though it be hard and Impossyble
to the freyle kind of man to suffer bodyly penance gladly and pacyently
without bitter stirynges of ire anger and male^coly. it is not Impossyble to
love yt is ye holy ghost for to worche this in a soul there he towcheth with
ye blessed yefte of love / But he yeueth a soul yt is in ye plyghte myghtily
felinges of love, and wonderfully fastneth it to Ihu^. and departs it wonder
far from the sensualyte through his preuy might and comfort it so swetly
by his blessed presence that the soul felith lytyl pain or else none of the
sensualyte. and this is specyal grace yeue^ to the holy marters / This grace
had the apostles as holy wryt says of him thus. Act. v.
Ibant apostoli gaude^tes a conspectu consilii qm^ digni habiti su^t pro nomine
xp^i co^tumelia^ pati / That is: The appostles yede Ioyenge fro the counseyle
of ye Jews wha they were beten with scourges and they were glad that they
were worthy for to suffer any bodily disease for the love of Ihesu / They were
not styred to ire ne to felnes to be avenged on the Jews that beten he^: as a
worldly man would be when he suffered a lytyl harm be it never so lytyl of his
euencrysten / Ne they were not styred to no pride. ne to hynes of he^self and
to dysdeyne and to demyng of ye Jews as ypocrites and heretykes are ye wol
suffer much bodily pain. and are sometime ready for to suffer death with great
gladness and with mighty will as it were in the name of Ihesu for love oh him /
Sothly ye love and ye gladness yt they have in suff^yng of bodily myscheyf is
not of the holy ghost / It comyth not fro ye fire that bre^neth in the hye
awter of heaven: but it is feyned by the fend enflammed of hell: for it is
fully me^ged with the heyght of pride and of presumpcion of hemselfe and
despyte and demyng and dysdeyne of hem that thus punysshe hem / They wene yt
all this is charity. and that they suffer all that for the love of god: but
they are begyled of ye myddaye fend / A true lover of ihu^ when he suffers
harm of his eue^ christian is so strengthed thorugh grace of the holy ghost and
is made so meke so pacyente so peasyble. And that so sothfastly. that what
wrong or harm it be that he suffer of his even christian he keeps ever mekenes
/ He dyspyseth him not he demyth him not but he prays for him in his heart
and has of him pity and co^passyon much more te^derly than of a another man yt
never did him harm / And sothly better loves him and more fervently desires
the salvation of his soul. by cause that he sees that he shall have so much
ghostly profit of the evil deed of that other man though it be against his will
/ But this love and this mekenes worcheth only the holy ghost above the kind
of man in hem that he makes the true lovers of Ihesu /

How love sleeth couetyse lechyry and glotenye / and sleeth that flesshly
savor and delight in all the v. bodyly wits softly and easily through a
gracyous beholding of Ihesu / Capitulum xxxix
COuetise also is slain in a soul by the worchinge of love: for it makyth the
soul so coueytous of ghostly good and to heavenly riches so ardaunt that it
sets right naught by all erthly things / It has no more deynte in having
of a precious stone thanne a chalk stone / ne more love has he in a hundredth
pound of gold thanne in a pound of leed / It sets al thing that shall
perysshe at one price / No more he charge that one than that other as in his
love / For it semyth well that al these erthly things that worldly men let so
great price of and love so deyntly should pass away and torn to naught both
the thing in itself and the love of it / And therefore he brings it in his
thought by time in to that plyghte that it shall be after. and so acounteth it
as naught / And when worldly lovers stryuen and fyghten. and plede for erthly
good who may first have it / the lover of Ihesu stryueth with no man but
kepyth himself in pees. and holds him paid with that yt he has and wol
strive for no more / For him thynkyth yt he nede^h no more of all the riches in
earth than a skant bodyly sustenaunce for to save the bodyly life withal as
long as god wol. and that he may lightly have / And therefore woll he no more
than skantly him needs for the time that he may freely be dyscharged fro
besynes about the keeping and the dispendyng of it. And fully give his heart
and his sesynes about the seeking of Ihesu for to find him in clen^es of
spirit: for that is al his couetyse / For why: oonly clean of heart shall see
him /

Also flesshly love of fader and mother and other worldly friends hangs not
upon him / It is even kutte fro his heart with the sword of ghostly love that
he has no more affeccion to fader or mother or to any worldly friend than he
has to a another man. But if he see or feel in hem more grace or more virtue
than in other men / Out take this: That his fader and his mother had the self
grace that some other men have / But nevertheless if they ben not so: then
loves he other men better tha^ hem. that is charity / And so sleeth goddis
love couetyse of the world. and brings in to the soul pouerte in spyryte /
And that does love not oonly in hem that have right naught or worldly good
but also in some creatures that are in great worldly state and have dispe^dinge
or erthly riches / Love sleeth in some of hem couetyse so ferforth that they
have more liking ne savor in having of hem than of a straw / Ne though they
be lost for defawte of hem that should keep hem they set naught thereby / For
why the heart of goddis lover is through the yefte of the holy ghost taken so
fully with ye syghte of the love of a another thing that is Ihesu. and that is
so precious and so worthy that it woll receive none other love restyngly that
^s contrary thereto / And not only does love this but also it sleeth the lykyng
of lechery and al other bodily uncleanness And brings in to ye soul very
chastyre. and torneth it in to likynge / For the soul felyth so great delight
in the syghte of Ihu^ that it lykyth for to be chaste and is no great hardness
to it for to keep chastyte. for it is so most ease and most rest / And upon
the self wise the yefte of love sleeth lusts of glotenye and makyth ye soul
sobre and temperaunt^ and bears it up so myghtily that it may not rest in
liking of mete and drink. but it takes mete and drink what it be that leest
greueth the bodyly co^plexyon if he may lightly come thereto Not for love of
itself. but for ye love of god / On this manner wise ye lover of god sees well
yt him needs for to keep his bodyly life with mete and drink aslo^ge as god
wol suffer him to be together / Then shall this be ye dyscreco^n of the lover of
Ihu^ as I understood y^ has felyng and worchynge in the love. yt upon what
manner yt he may most keep his grace hol^ and leest be let fro worchyng in
it thorugh taking of bodyly sustenaunce. so shall he do / That manner of mefe ye
leest lets and lest troubles ye heart and may keep the body in strength
be it flesh be it fysshe be it bread and ale: yt I trow the soul cheseth
for to have if it may come thereby / For all the besynes of the soul is for to
think on Ihu^ with reverent love ever without ^ettynge of any thing if yt it
might / And therefore sythen it must needs so^what be let and hyndred. the
less yt it is let and hyndred by mete or drink or any other thing the
leu^r it is / It had lever use the best mete and most of price under the
son^e if it less let the keeping of his heart than for to take but bread
and water if yt let him more / For he has no reward for to get him great
mede for the pain of fasting. and be put there by fro softnes in heart: but al
his besynes is for to keep his heart as stably as he may in the sight of Ihu^
and in the feeling o^ his love / And sothly as I trow he might with less
liking use ye best mete yt is good in the own kind than a another man yt
worcheth al in reason without the specyal yeft of love should mowse ye worst.
out take mete that through craft of cury osyte is only made for lust / That
manner of mete may he not well acorde with all / And also on that other side if
lytyl mete as only bread and ale most helps and eases his heart and kepyth
it most in pees it is most leyf than to him for to use it so. and namly if he
feel bodyly strength only of the yefte of love withal / And yet does love more
for it sleeth accidye and flesshly ydlenes and makyth the soul to be occupied
in goodness and namly Inward in beholding of him. by the virtue of which the
soul has savor and ghostly delight in prayenge in thinking and in all other
manner of doing that needs for to be done after the state that he is in
without heaviness or paynful bytternes whether he be relygious or seculer Also
it sleeth the vain lykyng of the v. bodyly wits / For the sight if the eye:
that the soul has no lykyng in the syghte of any worldly thing. but it feleth
rather pain and disease in beholdynge of it be it never so fair. never so
precious never so wonderful / And therefore as worldely lovers run out some
time for to se new things for to wonder on hem: And so for to feed her
hertis with the vain syghte of hem / Right so a lover of Ihesu is besye for
to run away and withdraw him fro the syghte of such manner things that the
Inner syghte be not let / For he sees ghostly a another manner thing that is
fayrer and more wonderful and that would he not forbere / Right on the self
wise is it of speaking and heryng It is a pain to ye soul of a lover of Ihu^
for to speak or here any thing yt might let the fredo^ of his heart for to
think on Ihu^. what so^ge or melody or mynst ralsye outward yt yt be if it
let the thought yt it may not freely / And rest fully pray or think on him /
It lykyth him right naught / and the more delectable yt it is to other men the
more unsavory it is to him / And also for to here any manner of spekyng of other
men but it be so^what towchynge the worchyng of his soul in the love of Ihu^
it lykyth him right naught. he is else right sone weary thereof: He had well
lever be in pees and here right nonght ne speak right naught than for to here
the speaking and ye techynge of the grettest clerk of earth with all ye reasons
that he can say to him thorugh man's wits. but if he can speak felyngly and
styryngly of the love of Ihesu for yt is his craft pryncypally / And therefore
would he not else speak: here ne see but that might help him and ferder him
in to more knowing. and better feeling of him / Of worldly speech it is no
dowte yt he has no savor speaking ne in herynge of it. ne in worldly tales ne
in tidings* ne no such vain Iangelyng. that longs not to him / And so it
is in smelling and saueryng / The more yt the thought should be dystracte and
broken fro ghostly rest by ye use either of smelling or sauerynge* or of any
of the bodyly wits the more he sleeth it / The less yt he feleth of hem the
lever is him / And if he might live in the dody without ye felyng of any of hem
he would never feel hem / For they trouble the heart often times / and puts
it fro rest. and they may not fully be eschewed Nevertheless the love of Ihu^
is sometime so mighty in a soul yt it ouercomyth and sleeth all yt is contrary
thereto for a time /

What virtues and graces a soul receives through openyng of yt In^er eye in to
ye gracyous beholding of Ihu^. and how it may not begete only through man's
traueyle but through specyal grace and traueyle also / Caplm^ xl.
THus worcheth love in a soul opening ye ghostly eye in to beholdynge of Ihu^
by inspyraco^n of specyal grace. and makyth it clean subtyl and able to ye
work of conte^placio^. what this openyng of ye ghostly eye is ye grettest
clerk i^ earth ca^ not ymagyn by his wit ne show fulli by his tongue. for it may
not be get by study ne thru man's traueyle only: but pri^cypally by grace of
ye holy ghost and with traueyle of man I dread much to speak out of it for me
thinks I ca^ not / I passes mine assay and my lyppes are unclean /
Neuertherles for I hope love axeth and love byddyth: therefore I shall say a
lytyl more of it as I hope love ^echeth / This opening of ye ghostly eye is ye
lyghty derkenes and rich naught yt I spoke of before. and it may be called
puryte of spyryte and ghostly rest: In ward stylnes and pees of conscience:
hyghnes of thought and on^lynes of soul. a lyftly feeling of grace and pryuyte
of heart. ye waker sleep of the spouse and taastynge of heavenly savor.
brennyng in love and shynynge in light. enter of conte^placo^n: and refourmyng
in felyng / Al these reasons are said in holy writing by dyuersmen for every
of hem spoke of it after his feeling in grace / And though al thise be^ diverse
in showing of words. nevertheless they are al in one sentence of sothfastnes
For a soul that through vysitynge of grace has one: has all / For why a
syghynge soul to see the face of Ihu^ when it towched through specially grace
of the holy ghost it is suddenly changed and turned fro the plyte yt it was in
to a another manner of feeling / It is wonderfully departed and drawn first in
to itself fro the love and the liking of al erthly thing somoche that it
has lost the savor of the bodyly life and of al thing yt is saaf only Ihu^
/ And then it is clean fro all the fylth of sin: so ferforth that ye mind of
it and al vnordeyned affection of any creature is suddenly wasshen and wyped
away. yt there is no mean lettynge betwyxe Ihu^ and the soul but oonly the
bobyly yfe: and then it is in ghostly rest / For why al paynful dowtes and
dredes and all other temptacyons of ghostly enuyes are driven out of the heart
yt they trowble not ne synke not therein for the time / It is in rest fro the
noye of worlly besynes and paynfull taryenges of wicked styrynges. but it is
full besye in the fre ghostly worchynge of love / And the more it traueyleth
so. the more rest he feleth /

This restful traueylle is full far fro flesshly ydlenes and blind sykernes
/ It is full of ghostly work / but it is called rest / For grace loses the
heavy yocke of flesshly love fro the soul and makyth it mighty and free thorugh
the yeft of ghostly love for to worche gladly softly and delectably in all
thing that grace styreth it for to worche in / And therefore it is called an
holy ydlenes and a rest most besy. and so it is in inrewarde stylnes fro the
great crye^ge of the bestly noise of flesshly desires and unclean thoughts /
This stylnes makyth Inspyracyon of the holy ghost in beholynge of Ihu^ / For
why: His voyse is so sweet so mighty that it puts sylenee in a soul to
Ia^glynge of al other spekers: for it is a voys of virtue softly sowned in a
clean soul of the which the prophet says thus / Uox dn^i i^ virtute / That
is / The voys of our lord Ihesu is in virtue / This voys is a lyfely word and
a spedy as the apostle says / Uiuus est sermo dei et efficax et penetrabilior
omni gladio / That is. quycke is ye word of Iu^ and spedy. more perysshynge
than any sword is / Through speaking of this word is flesshly love slain and
the soul kept in scyle^ce fro al wicked styrynges / Apoc.
Of this scilence it is said in the apocalips thus / Factu^ est scilenciu^ in
celo quasi dimidia hora / Scylence was made i^ heaven as it were an half hour
/ Heaven is a clean soul through grace lift up fro erthly love to heavenly
co^uersaco^n and so it is in silence / But for as much as that scylence may
not last hoole contynually for corrupcyon of the bodily kind / Therefore it is
lyckened to the time of half an hour / A full short time ye soul thinks
yt it is be it never so long / And therefore it is but an half hour / And
then has it pees in conscience / For why Grace puttyth out gnawynge
prickynge and stryuynge and flyghtynge of sins / And brings in pees and
accord. and makyth Ihesu and a soul both one in full accordaunce of will /
There is none vpbardynge of sins: ne sharp repreuyng of defawtes made ye
time in a soul / For they have kyssed and made friends. and al is forgiven yt
was mysse done / Thus felyth the soul then with full meke sikernesse and great
ghostly gladness / And co^ceyueth a full great boldness of salvation by this
accord making / For it heryth a preuy wytnessynge in consciency of the holy
ghost that he is a chosen sone to heavenly heritage Thus saint poul says / Ipse
spiritus testimonium pe^hibet spiritui nostro quontam filii dei sumus That is.
The holy ghost berith wytnes to our spyryte yt we are goddis sons / This
wytnessynge of conscience sothfastly felt through grace is ye very Joy of ye
soul as ye apostle says / s. little*
Gloria mea est testimoniu^ conscientie me / That is: my Joy is ye witness
of my conscye^ce and yt is when it wytnessyth pees and acorde true love and
fre^dshyp betwyxe Ihu^ and a soul. And when it is in this pees then is it in
hyghnes of thought / When y^ soul is bounden with love of ye world then is
it byne^h al creatures / For every thing ouergooth it and beryth it down by
maystry yt it may not see Ihesu ne love him / For right as ye love of the
world is vain and flesshly / Rygh so the beholdynge and thinking. and using
of all creatures is flesshly / And that is a thraldom of the soul / But then
through openyng of ye ghostly eye in to Ihu^ ye love is turned / And ye soul is
receysed up after his own kind a boue all bodily creatures /

And then the beholdynge and thynkyng and the using of he^ is ghogly / For the
love is ghostly / The soul has then full great dysdeyne for to be buxom to
love of worldly things. for it is high set above hem thorugh grace / It
sets naught by all the world. for why: al shall pass and perysshe / unto
this hynes of heart while the soul is kept therein comyth none error ne
deceyte of the fend: for Ihesu is fothfastly in sight of the soul that time
and al thing byneth him / Of this ye prophet speaks thus / Accedat ho^ ad cor
altu^ et exaltabitur deus. P. lxii.


Come man to high heart and god shall be highed / That is a man y^ through grace
comyth to the hyghnes of thought shall see that Ihu^ is oonly hyghed above all
creatures. and he in him / And then is ye soul above much strau^ged fro
felyshyp of worldly lovers / Though her body be in mids among hem. full far
ben they departed fro flesshly affeccions of creatures I charge not though it
never se man ne speak with him ne have comfort of him if it might ever be so
in that ghostly feeling / It felyth so great homlynes of the blessed presence
of our lord Ihesu and somoche savor of him that it may lightly for his love
foryete yt flesshly affeccco^n and the flesshly mind of al creatures / I say
not that it shall not love ne think of other creatures. but I say that it shall
think on hem in time and see hem and love hem ghostly and freely. not flesshly
and paynfully as it did before / Of this oonlynes speaks the prophet thus /
Ducam eam in solitudine. oseexii
et loquar ad cor eius / I shall led her in to only stead. and I shall speak to
her heart / That is: Grace of Ihu^ ledeth a soul fronoyous company of flesshly
desires in to oonlynes of thought. and makyth it foryete the liking of the
world and sowneth by swetnes of his Inspyracyon words of love in eeres of the
heart / Oonly is a soul when it loves Ihesu and tentyth fully to him and has
lost the savor and the conforte of the world And that it might better keep
this oonlynes it flees ye company of all men if it may. And sechyth oonlynes
of body: for that much helps to oonlynes of the soul and to the free
worchynge of love / The less lettynge yt it has without of vain Ianglyng or
within of vayn thinking the more free it is in ghostly beholdynge. and so it
is in pryuyte of heart / Al without is a soul whiles it is ouerlayed and
blinded with worldly love / It is as comen as the hye way for every stirynge
that comes of the flesh or of ye fend synketh in and gooth thorugh it / But
then through grace it is drawn in to the preuy chamber in to the syghte of
our lord Ihesu. and hereth his preuy counseyle. And is wonderfully comforted
in the herynge / Of this spekith the prophet thus / Secretum meum michi.
secretum meum michi / My preuytee to me. my preuyte to me / That is. Isay.
xxiiii.
The lover of Ihu^ through Inspyracyon of grace taken up fro outward feeling of
worldely love and rauysshed in to the preuyte of ghostly love yeldeth thanking
to him saye^ge thus / My pryuete to me. That is. My lord Ihu^ thy preuyte is
showed to me and preuyly hid fro al lovers of the world / For it is called
hid nanna. That may lightlyer be asked than told what it is / And that our
lord Ihesu behoteth to his lover saying thus / Dabo sibi manna absconditum
quod nemo nouit nisi qui ac cipit / That is: Apoc.
I shall give manna hid that no man knows but he that takith it / This
manna is heavenly mete and angels fode as holy writ says / For angels are
fully feed and filled with clear syghte in brenuynge love of our lord Ihesu.
and that is ma^na / For we mo we ask what it is: but not wit what it is / But
ye lover of Ihu^ is not filled yet here: but he is fed by a lytyl taastynge
of it whiles he is bounden in this bodyly life /

This tastynge of this manna is a lyfly feeling of gra had thorugh opening of
the ghostly eye / And this grace is not an other grace that a chosen soul
felyth in the beginning of his conuersyon: but it is the same and ye self
grace: but it is otherwise felt and showed to a soul For why grace wexeth with
the soul and the soul wexeth with grace / And ye more clean yt the soul is
far departed fro the love of the world the more mighty is the grace: more in
ward and more ghostly showing in the presence of our lord Ihesu: so yt the
same grace yt torneth hem first too sins: and makyth hem beginning and
profytynge by yeftes of virtue and exercise of good works maken hem also
perfyte / And tha^ grace is called a lyfly feeling of grace. for he y^ has it
felyth it well. and knows well by experyence that he is in grace / It is full
lyfly t^ him for it quyckneth the soul wonderfully and makyth it so hole that
it feleth no paynful disease of the body though it be feeble and sykly / For
why. then is the body myghtyest most hole and most restful and the soul
also. without this grace the soul can not live but in pain: for it thynkith
yt it might ever keep it and no thing should put it away / And nevertheless
yet it is not so. for it passes away full lightly / But nevertheless though the
souereyne feeling passes away and withdraw. the reley fleneth still and
kep^th the soul in sadness. and makyth it for to desire ye coming again / And
this is also the waker sleep of the spouse: Cant v
of the which holy writ says thus / Ego dormio and cormen^ vigilat / I
sleep and my heart wakyth / That is. I sleep ghostly when thorugh grace the
love of the world is slain in me and wicked styrynges of flesshly desires are
deed: somoche that uneaths I feel hem / I am not tarried with hem. my heart is
made free / And then it wakyth. for it is sharp and ready for to love Ihu^ and
see him The more I sleep fro outward things ye more waker I am in knowing of
Ihesu and of In ward things / I may not wake to Ihesu but if I sleep to the
world / And therefore ye grace of the holy ghost sperynge ye flesshly eye does
the soul sleep fro worldly vanytee: and opening the ghostly eye wakyth in to
the syghte of goddys mageste helyd under the cloud of his precious manhede /
As the gospel says of the apostles when they were with our lord Ihesu in
his transfyguracyon / First they slepte / Et euigilantes videru^t magestatem /
They waking saw his mageste / By sleep of the apostles is understand deyenge
of worldly love through Inspyracio^ of the holy ghost. By her walking
contemplacion of Ihesu / Thorugh this sleep the soul is brought in to rest
fro noise of flesshly lust / And through walkinge it is raised up in to the
syghte of Ihesu and gnost^ely ^h^nges / The more that the eyes are spered in
this (...) sleep fro the aperyte of erthly thing. The sharper is the Inner
syghte in lovely beholdynge of heavenly fay^hede This slepynge and this waking
love worcheth thorughe the light of grace in the soul of the lover of our
lord Ihesu /

How specyal grace in beholdynge of our lord Ihesu withdrawyth sometime fro a
soul / And how a soul shall have her in the abs^ence and presence of Ihu^ /
And how a soul shall desire that in it is always ye gracyous presence of Ihesu
/ Caplm^ xli.
Show me then a soul that thorugh inspyracyon of grace has opening of the
ghostly sight in to beholding of Ihu^ y^ is departed and drawn out fro ye lo^^
of the world so ferforth that it has puryte and pouerte of spyrite: ghostly
rest: In ward scylence. and pees in conscience: hyghnes of thought on^lynes
and pryuyte of heart: waker sleep of the spouse. that has lost lykyng and
Joys of ye world taken with delight of heavenly savor. ever threstynge: and
softly shyghynge y^ blessed presence of Ihu^. and I dare hardly pronounce that
this soul bren^eth al in love and shyneth in ghostly light worthy for to come
to the name and to the worship of the spowse: for it is reformed in feeling
made able and ready to contemplacyon / These are the tokens of Inspyraco^n in
opening of ye ghostly eye For why when the eye is opened the soul is in full
feeling of al these virtues before said for that time / Nevertheless it falls
often times that grace withdrawyth in party for corrupco^n of man's freelte.
and suffers then the soul for to fall in to itself in flesshlyhede as it was
beforne / And then is the soul in pain and in sorrow: for it is blind and
unsavory and can no good / It is weyke and vnmyghty enco^bred with the body and
with all ye bodyly wits / It se^heth and desires after ye grace of Ihu^ again
and it may not find it / For holy wry^ says of our lord thus Postqm^ vultu^
suu^ absconderit non e^ qui conte^plat eu^ That is: After when our lord Ihu^
has hid his face there is none that may behold him. when he shows him
the soul may not vnsee him. for he is light. and wha^ he hydeth him it may not
see him for the soul is derke / His hydynge is but a subtyl assayenge of the
soul / His showing is a wonder merciful goodness in comfort of the soul /
Have ye no wonder though the feeling of grace be withdraw sometime fro a lover
of Ihu^ / For holy writ says ye same of the spouse that she fares thus /
Quesiui et non inueni illu^. Cant. 3
vocaui et no^ respondit michi / I seched and I found him not / I called and
he answered not / That is: when I fall down to my frelte then grace
withdraws for my falling is cause thereof. and not his fleeng / But then feel
I pain of my wretchydnes in his absence / And therefore I sought him by great
desire of heart: and he yaue to me no feeble answering / And then I cried with all my soul / Cant. con
Reuertere dilecte mi / Torn again thou my loved / And yet it semyd as he herd
me not The paynful feeling of myself and the assaylynge of flesshly loves and
dredes in this time and ye wantyng of my ghostly strength is a contynuel
cryenge of my soul to Ihesu. And nevertheless our lord makyth strange and
comyth not cry I never so fast / For he is syker enough of his lover yt he wol
not torn again to worldly love fully he may no savor have therein. and therefore
abides he the longer

But at the last when he wol he comyth again full of grace and of sothfastnes.
and vysyteth the soul ye languyssheth in desire by syghynges of love to his
presence. and to wchyth it and anoynteth it full softly with the oil of
gladness. and makyth it suddenly hole fro al pyne: and then cries the soul to
Ihesu in ghostly voys with a glad heart thus / Oleum effusum nomen tuum / Oil
yshedde is thy name / Thy name is Ihesu. Cant. i
that is hele / Then aslonge as I feel my soul sore and syke for sin pyned
with ye heavy burden of my body sorry and dredynge for perils and wretchydnes
of this life. so long lord Ihu^ thy name is oil speryd not oyleshed to me /
But wha^ I feel my sou^e suddenly towched with the light of thy grace heled and
softed fro all the fylthe of sin. and comforted in love and in light with
ghostly strength and gladness unspeakable. then may I say with lusty loving
and ghostly might to the Oil yshed is thy name Ihu^ to me / For by the
affecte of thy grayous vysytynge I feel well of thy name the true expownynge y^
thou art Ihu^ heel. For oonly thy gracyous presence helyth me fro sorrow and
fro syn^e / Blessed is y^ soul that is ever fed in felyng of love in his
presence. or is borne up by desire to him in his absence / A wise lo^er is he
and well taught y^ sadly and reuereutly has him in his presence and lovely
beholds him without dyssolute lyghtnes. and pacyently and easily beryth him
in his absence without venomous dispeyre and over pynful bytternesse / This
chaungabilyte of absence and presence of Ihu^ that a soul felyth is not
perfeccyon of the soul. ne it is not against the grace of perfeccyon or of
contemplacyon but in so much perfeccyon is the less / For the more lettynge
y^ a soul has of itself fro contynuel feeling of grace the less is the
grace: and yet nevertheless is ye grace in itself grace of conte^placyon / This
chaungabylyte of absence and presence falls as well in the state of perfeccyon
as in state of beginning: but in a another manner: for right as there is
dyuersyte of feeling in the presence of grace bytwex these two states. right so
is there in the absence of grace / And therefore he that knows not the absence
of grace is ready to be dysceyued / And he that kepith not the presence of grace
is unkind to ye vysytyng whether he be in state of begynners or perfyte /
Nevertheless the more stablenes that there is in grace vnhur^e and unbroken the
louelyer is the soul and more like unto him in whom is no chaungabylyte as ye
apostles says And it is full ^emely that the spouse be like to Ihu^ spouse in
manners and in virtues full acordynge to him in stablynes of pe^fyre love / But
y^ falls seeldom now here but in the specyal spouse / For he that perceyueth
no chau^gabylyte in felyng of his grace but ylyke hole and stable unbroken and
unhurt as him thinks. he is eytherful perfyte or full blind / He is perfyte
that is sequestyrde fro al flesshly affeccyons and comonynge of al creatures:
and al means are broken away of corrupcyon and of syn^e betwyx Ihu^ and his
soul fully ooned to him with softnes of love / But this is only grace above
mannys kind /

He is full blind yt feyneth him in grace without ghostly feeling of goddys
Inspyracyon. and sets himself in a manner of stablynes as he were ever in
felyng and in worchynge of specyal grace: demyng that al is grace that he does
and felyth without and within. thinking that what so ever he do or speak is
grace: holdyng himself vnchau^gable in specyallyte of grace. If there be any
such as I hope there be none: he is full blind in feeling of grace / Bu^ then
might thou say thus that we should love only in truth. Heb. x.
and not coueyte ghostly felynges ne reward hem if they come / For the apostle
says / Iustus ex fide viuit / That is: The ryghtwysman lives in truth. Unto
this I say y^ bodyly felynges ben they never so comfortable we shall not coueyte
ne reward much if they come / But ghostly felynges such as I spoke of if
they come in the manner as I have said before we should ever desire: yt are
sleenge of al worldly love openyng of y^ ghostly eye: puryte of spi^ite: pees
of conscience: and al other before said / We should coueyte to feel ever the
lyfly Inspyracyon of grace made by ye ghostly presence of Ihu^ in our soul if
yt we might. and for to have him in our sight with reverence. and ever feel ye
swetnes of his love by a wonderful homlynes of his presence / This should be
our life and our feling in grace after ye mesure of his yefte in whom al grace
is. to some more and to some less / For his presence is feled in diverse manner
wise as he wouchith saaf / And in this we should live and worche that longs
to us to worche. for without this we should not cunne live / For right as the
soul is the life of the body. right so is Ihesu the life of the soul by his
gracyous presence / And nevertheless this manner feeling be it never so much it
is yet but troth as in reward of that y^ shall be of these Il^hesu in the
bliss of heaven / Lo this feeling should we desire for eueryche a soul
reasonable o with for to coueyte with all the myghtes of it nyghyng to Ihu^ and
oonynge to him thorugh feeling of his gracyous vnseable presence / How y^
presence is feled it may better be known by experyence than by any writing.
for it is the life and the love: the might and the light / the Joy and the
rest of a chosen soul / And therefore he that has ones sothfastly feled it
may not forbere it without pain he may not vndesyre it it is so good in
itself / and so comfortable / what is more comfortable to a soul here than
for to be draw out through grace fro the vile noye of worldly belynesse and
fylthe of desires and fro vain affection of al creatures in to rest and
softnes of ghostly love pryuely perceiving ye gracyous presence of Ihesu
felably fed with savor of his vnseable blessed face / Sothly ne thing me
thinks / No thing may make the soul of a lover full of myrthe but the
gracyous presence of Ihesu as he can show him to a clean soul /

He is never heavy ne sorry but when he is with himself in flesshlynes / He is
never full glad ne merry but when he is out of himself as he was with Ihesu in
his ghostlynes / And yet is that no full myrthe. for ever there hangs an heavy
lu^pe of bodyly corrupcyon on his soul: and bears it down and much lets
y^ ghostly gladness. and y^ must ever be whiles it is here in this life but
neuerthese for I speak of chaungabylyte of grace how it comy^th and goth that
thou mystake it not. therefore I mean not of the common grace that is had and
felt in troth and in good will to god without the which having and lasting
therein no man may be saaf. for it is in the leest chosen so u^e y^ lives but
I mean of specyal grace felt by Inspyracyon of ye holy ghost in the manner as
it is before said / The comen grace that is charity lasts hole what so ever a
man do aslonge as his will and his entente is true to god without the which
having and lasting that he would not sin dedely. ne the deed y^ he wylfully
does is not forbede as for dedely sin / For this grace is not losts but for
dedely syn^e / And then it is dedely sy^ne when his concyence witnesses with a
vysement that it is dedely sin / and yet nevertheless he does it or else his
conscience is so blinded that he holds it no dedely syn^e al though he do
the deed wylfully the which is forbode of god and holy church as dedely sin
/ Specyal grace felt through the vnseable presence of Ihesu that makyth a soul
a perfyte lover lastyth not euerylyke hole in the hyghnes of felyng. but
chau^gably comyth and gooth as I have said before / Thus our lord says / Ioh.
3
Spu^s vbi vult spirat and vocem eius audis and nescis vnde veniat aut quo
vadat The holy ghost spyreth where he woll and thou herest his voys but thou
wost not wha^ he comith ne whether he gooth / He comyth pryuely some time when
thou art leest waar of him: but thou shall well know him or thou go / For
wonderfully he styryth and myghtyly torneth thin heart in to beholding of his
godenes. and does thin heart melte delectably as wax against y^ fire in to
softnes of his love. and this is the voys that he sowneth / But then he gooth
or thou wot it for he withdrawyth him so^what / naught in all: but fro excess
in to sobirte / The hyghnes passes: but ye substance and theffectte of grace
dwells stylle / And that is aslo^ge as ye soul of a lover kepyth him clean /
and falls not wylfully to recheleshede or dissolucion in flesshlynes ne to
outward vanyte. as somtym^ it does though it have no delight therein for frelte
of itself Of this chau^gabylyte i^ grace speak I of now /

A commendacyon of prayer offered to Ihu^ of a soul contemplatyfe / And how
stablynes in prayer is a syker work to sto^de in / And how every feeling of
grace in a chosen soul may be said Ihu^: but the more clenner the soul is the
worthyer is the grace / Caplm^. xlii.
THe soul of a man while it is not towched with specyal grace is blunt and
boystous to ghostly work and c^ naught thereon / It may not thereof for weyknes
of itself / It is both old and dry. undevout and unsavory in itself / But
then comyth the light of grace. and through towchyng makyth it sharp and
suptyl ready and able to ghostly work: and yeueth it a great fredom and an hole
redynes in will for to be buxom to all the styrynge of grace ready for to worche
after that grace styreth the soul / For by opening of ye ghostly eye it is
applied al fully to grace ready to pray / And how the soul prays then shall
I tell the / The most specyal prayer that y^ soul uses and has most
comfort in I hope is the Pater noster. or else psalms of the sawter / The
pater noster for lewd men. and psalms and ympnes and other service of holy
church for lettred / The soul prays then not in manner as it did before
in common manner of men by hyghnes of voys: or by renable speaking out. but in
full great stylnesse of voys and softnes of heart / For why. his mind is not
trowbled ne tarried with outward things but hole gadred together in itself /
And the soul is set as it were in a ghostly presence of Ihu^. and therefore
every word and every syllable is sowned sauerly sweet and delectably with full
acorde of mouth and of heart / For why the soul is turned then al in to fire
of love / And therefore every word that it preuely prays is leke to a spercle
springyng out of a fire bronde y^ chafeth al ye myghtes of the soul and
torneth he^ i^ to love. and lytneth he^ so co^fortably yt ye soul list ever
for to pray and do none other thing / The more it prays ye better it may ye
myghtier it is / for grace helps ye soul well and makyth al thing light and
easy yt it list right well to psalm and sing the louynges of god with ghostly
mirth in heavenly delight / This ghostly work is fode of ye soul. and this
prayer is of much virtue / For it wastes and brings to nout al te^ptaco^ns
of ye fend preuy and a perte. it sleth al ye mind and ye liking of ye
world. and of flesshly sins. it bears up ye body and ye soul fro paynful
feeling of wretchydnes of this life / It kepyth ye soul i^ felyng of grace and
worchyng of love: and norysshe it ever ylyke hot and fresshe as styckes
norissheth fire / It puttith away alyrkyng and heaviness of heart: holds it i^
smight and i^ ghostly gladness / Of this prayer spekyth dauyd thus / Dirigat
oracio mea sicut insensu^ in conspectu tuo. That is: Dressed be my prayer lord
as ence^ce in thy sight / For right as ensence yt is cast in ye fire makyth a
sweet smell by ye reke styghyng up to the air / right so a psalm sauourly and
softly song or said in a brennynge heart yeuyth up a sweet smelle to ye face
of our lord Ihu^: and to all the court of heaven / There dare no flesh fly
rest upon the pottes brynke boylynge on the fire / Right so may there no
flesshly delight rest upon a clean soul yt is happed and warmed al in ye fire
of love boylytige and blowinge psalms and louynges to Ihu^ / This prayer is
ever herd of Ihesu / It yeldyth grace to Ihesu / And receives grace again /
It makyth a soul homely and felowly with Ihu^. and with all the angels of
heaven / Use it who so may. The work is good and gracyous in itself / And
though it be not al fully contemplacyon. in itself ne the werkyng of love by
itself / Nevertheless it is a part of contemplacyon / For why: It may not
be done on this manner wise but in plentee of grace through openinge of the
ghostly eye / And therefore a soul that has this fredom and this gracyous
feeling in prayenge with ghostly savor and heavenly delight has the grace of
contemplacyon in manner as it is / This prayer is a rich off^ynge filled al in
fatnes of devotion: received by angels and presented to the face of Ihesu / The
prayer of other men that are besy in actyf works is made of two words. For
they often times fourmeth in her hertes one word through thynkyng of worldly
besynes. and sownen in her mouth a another word of ye psalm song or said /
And not for that. if her entente be true yet is her prayer good and medeful
though it lack sauoure and swetnes / But this manner of a man co^templatyfe is
made but of one word. for as it is fourmed in ye heart right so holy it
sowneth in the mouth. as it were naught but one thing that fourmyth and
sowneth / And sothly no more it is / For the soul through grace is made hole in
itself so far departee fro the flesshlyhede that it is master of the body.
and thn^e is the body naught else but as an Instrumente and a tro^pe of the
soul in the which the soul blowith sweet notes of ghostly louynges to Ihu^ /
This is the trompe that Dauyd spoke of thus / P. lxxx
Buccinate in neomenia tuba in insigni die sole^pnitatis vestre / Blow ye with
a trompe in the new moan / That is ye souls that are reformed in ghostly
lift through opening of the Inner eye. Blow ye devoutly sownynge psalms with
the trompe of your bodily tongue / And therefore for this prayer is plesa^nte to
Ihesu and so profitable to the soul: Then it is good to him that is new
turned to god what that he be that would pleyse him / And coueyteth to have
some queynt felyng of grace for to coueyte this feeling. That he might through
grace come to this lyberte of spyryte. and offer his prayers and his psalms to
Ihesu contynuelly: and stably and devoutly with hole mind and brennyng
affecco^n in him to have it nere ho^de in custom wha^ grace wol styre him
thereto. This is a syker feeling and a sothfast / If thou may come thereto and
hold it the dare not run about here and there: and axe questyons of every
ghostly man what thou should do how thou shalt love god: and how thou shall
serve god and speak of ghostly matters yt passen thy knowing as perchance some
done / That manner of doing is not full profitable but if more need make it:
Keep y^ to thy prayers stylly first with traueyle yt thou might come
afterward to this restful feeling of ghostly prayer: and that shall teache the
wisdom enough sothfastly without feynynge or fantasye. and keep it fourth if
they have it and leave it not: but if grace come other wise and woll remove it
fro the for a time and make ye for to worche on a another mane^. then may thou
leave it for a time and after torn again thereto / And he that has this grace in
prayer asks not whereupon he shall set the point of his thought in his
prayer whether upon the words that he says or else on god or on the name of
Ihu^ as some ask: for the feeling of grace techyth him well enough /

For why the soul is turned in to the eye and sharply beholds the face of
Ihu^. and is made syker that it is Ihu^ y^ it felyth and sees / I mean not
Ihu^ as he is in himself in fulness of his blessed godhede. but I mean Ihesu as
he wol show him to a clean soul holden in body after the clennesse that it
has / For wit thou well that every ^he a feeling of grace is Ihesu and may be
called Ihesu / And after that the grace is more or less so felyth the soul
more or less Ihesu / ye the first feeling of specyal gra^e in a begynner that
is called grace of compun^ yon and contricyon for his sins is verily Ihu^:
for whythe makes ye contrycyon in a soul by his presence / But Ihu^ is then
full boystously and rudely felt. full far fro his ghostly subtylte: for the
soul can no better ne may no better for uncleanness of itself then /
Nevertheless afterward if ye soul profit and increase in virtues and in
clennes the same Ihesu and none other is seen and felt of the same soul when
it is towched with grace / but yt is more ghostly nere to the godly kind of
Ihesu / And sothly yt is the most thing that Ihesu loves in a foul that it
might be made godly and ghostly in syghte and in love like to him in grace to
that y^ he is by kind. for that shall be the end of all lovers /

Then may thou be syker that what time that thou felyste thy soul styred by
grace specially in that manner as it is before said by opening of thy ghostly
eye thou see and feleste Ihu^ / Hold him fast while thou may and keep the
in grace: and let him naught lightly fro the Look after none other Ihesu but
that same by feeling of that self grace more godly that it might wexe in the
more and more / And dread the naught thou Ihu^ that thou felyst be not Ihesu as
he is in his full godhede that thou sholdest therefore mow be deceived if thou
lened to thy feeling: but trust thou well if thou be a lover of Ihesu that thy
felyng is true and that Ihesu is truly felt and seen of the thorugh his grace
as thou may se him here / And therefore leave fully to thy feeling when it is
gracyous and ghostly. and keep it tenderly. and have great deynte not of
thyselfe but of it. that thou might see: and feel Ihesu ever better and better
/ For grace shall even techethe by itself if thou wol fall thereto till thou
come to the end / But perchance thou begynnest to wonder why I say one time
yt grace worchyth all this. and on a another tym yt love worchyth or god
worchyth. Unto this I say the yt when I say ye grace worcheth I mean love.
Ihesu: and god. for all is one. and naught but one / Ihu^ is love Ihesu is
grace. Ihesu is god / And for he worcheth all in us by his grace for love as
god therefore may I use what word of these iiii. that me list after my styrynge
in this writynge /

How a soul through the opening of the ghostly eye receives a gracous love
able to understood holy wryt And how Ihesu that is hid in holy wryt shewyth
him self to his lovers Caplm^ xliii
THen the soul of a lover felyth Ihu^ in prayer in the manner before said. and
thynkyth y^ it would never feel otherwise / Nevertheless it falls that sometime
grace puts scilence to vocal prayeng: and styreth the soul to see and to
feel / Ihesu in a another manner / And that manner is first to see Ihu^ in holy
wrytt / For Ihu^ that is al sothfastnes is hid and heled therein wounde^ in a
^ofte sendyle under fair words that he may not be know ne felt but of a clean
h^rte / For why: sothfastnes woll not show itself to enmyes but to friends
that love and desire it with a meke heart. for sothfastnes and mekenes arne full
true systers fastened together in love and charity / and therefore is there no
lenynge of counseylle betwyxe hem two / Mekenes presumyth of sothfastnes and
no thing of itself. And sothfastnes tro with well on mekenes: and so they
accorden wonder well / Then for as much as a soul of a lover is made meke
through inspyracyon of grace by opening of the ghostly eye: and sees that it
is naught of itself / But oonly ha^geth in ye mercy an^ the godenes of Ihu^
lastyngly is borne up by favor and help of him only / and truly desiring ye
presence of him therefore sees it Ihu^ / For it sees sothfastnes of holy
writ wonderly showed and opened above study and traueyle and reason of
man's kyndly wit / And that may well be called the feeling and the perceiving
of Ihesu / For Ihesu is well of wisdom. and by a lytyl heeldynge of his
wysdom in to a clean soul he makes the soul wise enough for to understand
al holy writ. not al at ones in specyal beholdynge: but thorugh that grace
the soul receives a new ablynes and a gracyous habyte for to understand it
specially when it comyth to mind. This opening and this clernesse of wit is
made by the ghostly presence of Ihesu / For right as the ghospel says of ii.
dyscyples going to the castle of Emaus brennynge in desire and speaking of our
lord Ihesu: Luc. xiiii.
our lord appeared to hem presently as a pilgrim and taught hem ye prophecyes
of himself / And as the gospel says / Apperuit illis sensum vt intelligerent
scripturas / He opened to hem clernesse of wit yt they might understand holy
writing / Right so the ghostly presence of Ihesu openyth the wit of his
lover that it brenneth in desire to him: and brings to his mind by
mynystracyon of angels the words and the sentences of holy writ vnsoughte
and unadvised one after a another. and expowneth hem redyly be they never so
hard ne so preuy /

The harder that they ben and ferder fro man's reasonable understanding the
more delectable is the treue showing of hem / When Ihesu is master it is
expowned and declared lytterally: morally: mystyly: and heavenly: if the matter
suffer it / By letter that is lyghteste and most plain is bodyly kind
comforted / By moralte of holy writ the soul is infourmed of vices and
virtues wisely to cunne depart ye one fro that other / By mystyhede it is
illumined for to see the works of Ihesu in holy church. redily for to apply
the words of holy writ to christ our head: and to holy church that is his
mysty body / And the fourth yt is heavenly longs oonly to the worchynge of
love / And that is wha^ all sothfastnes in holy writ is applied to love /
And for that is most like to heavenly feeling therefore I call it heavenly /
The lover of Ihesu is his friend. not for he has deserved it: but for Ihu^ of
his mercy full goodness makyth him his friend by true accord / And therefore as
to a true friend that pseyseth him with love. not serves him by dread as a
thralle: Ioh xv
he shewyth his preuyte / Thus he says himself to his apostles / I am vos
dixi amicos qr quecunque audiui a patre meo nota feci vobis / Now I say that
ye are friends / For I make known to you al things that I have herd of my
fader / To a clean soul that has ye palet puryfyed from fylthe of flesshly
love holy writ is lyfely food and sustenaunce delectable /

It sauoureth wonder swetely wha^ it is well chewed by ghostly understanding /
For why. the spyryte of lyffe is hid therein that quyckenyth all the myghtes of
ye soul / and fylleth them full of swetnesse of he^enly sauoure and ghostly
delight / But sothly him needs to have white teeth and sharp and well pycked
that should byte of this ghostly bread / For flesshly lovers and herytykes may
not towche y^ Inward flower of it / Her teeth are blody and full of fylthe.
therefore they ben fasting fro feeling of this bread / By teeth are understand
the Inly wits of the soul / the which in flesshly lovers and in heretykes
ben blody full of sin and of worldly vanytees / They would and they can not
come by curyosite of her kyndly wit to the sothfastnes in knowing of holy
writ. for her wit is corrupt by original sin and actuell also. And is
not yet helyd through grace. And therefore they do but gnawe upon ye bark
without speak they never so much thereof / The Inner savor within they feel
not of / They ben not meke they ben not clean for to see it / They ben not
friends to Ihesu. and therefore he shows hem not his counsel / The preuyte
of holy wryt is closed under a keye seled with a sygnet of Ihesus finger: yt is
the holy ghost / And therefore withouten his love and his leave may no man come
in / He has only ye keye of cu^nynge in his keeping as holy wryt says / and
he is keye himself / And he lets i^ whom he wolby Inspyracyon of his grace.
and breketh not the selle. and yt does Ihu^ to his lovers / Not to alylyke /
but to hem yt are specially Inspyred for to seek sothfastnes in holy wryt with
great deuoco^n in prayenge. and with much besynes in studyenge going before /
These may come to the finding when our lord Ihu^ will show it / See now
then^e how grace opens the ghostly eye and clereth ye wit of the soul
wonderly above the freelte of corrupt kind / It yeueth ye soul a new
ablenes whether it wol read holy wryt or here or think it for to understand
it truly and sauourly yt sothfastnes of it in ye manner before said / And for
to torn redely al reasons and words yt are bodyly said in to ghostly
understanding. and yt is no great merueyle / For ye same spyryte expownyth it
and declares it in a clean soul in comfort of it yt first made it. and that
is the holy ghost / And this grace may be and is as well in lewd as in lettred
men as anenstes the substance and the true feeling of soth fastnes and the
ghostly savor of it in general though they see not so many reasons in specyal:
for that needs not And when ye soul is thus abled and lyghtned through grace.
then it list for to be alone sometime out of lettyng or comonynge of al
creatures that he might freely assaye his Instrument that I call his reason in
beholdynge of sothfastnes that is contained in holy wryt / And then there fall
to mind words and reasons and sentences enough to occupye him in full ordynate
and full sadly / And what comfort and ghostly delight: savor and swetnes a
soul may feel then in his ghostly work through diverse Illumynacyons: Inly
perceyuynges: preuy knowynges and sodeyn towchynges of the holy ghost by assaye
the soul may wit and else not / And I hope that he shall not err be so y^
his teeth that been his In ward wettes be kept white and clean fro ghostly
pride and fro curyosyte of kyndly wit / I hope that Dauyd felt full great delight
in this manner work when he said thus / little xiii
Qm^ dulcia faucibes meis eloquia tuasuper mel ori meo / How sweet are thy
spekinges lord Ihu^ to my chekes over honey to my mouth / That is: Lord Ihu^
thyn holy words endyted in holy wryt brought to my mind through grace are
swetter to my chekes yt are ye affecco^ns of my soul than honey is to my mouth
Sothly this is a fair work without paynful traueille for to see Ihesus thus
/ This is one manner of sight of Ihu^ as I said before / Not as he is: but
clothed under lykenes of works and of words / Perspeculum in enigmate / By a
myrroure and by a lyckenesse / As the appostle says / Ihesu is endeles might
wisdom and goodness: Right wysnesse: sooth fastness: holiness. and mercy /
And what this Ihesu is in himself may no soul seen here. But by effect of
his worchyng he may be seen through the light of grace. as thus / His might is
seen by making of al creatures of naught. his wisdom inordinate disposynge of
hem: his goodness in saving of hem his mercy in foryeuenes of sins. his
holiness in yeftes of grace: his right wynes in hard punysshyng of sin his
softnes in true rewardynge of good works / And all this is expressed in holy
wrytt. And this sees a soul in holy writ with all other accydentes that
fallen herto / And wit thou well that such gracyous knowynges in holy writ
or in other writing that is made thorugh grace are naught else but sweet
letters se^den and made betwyx a loving soul and Ihesu loved / Or else if I
shall say sothlyer betwyxe Ihesu ye true lover and the souls loved of him /
He has full great tenderness of love to al his chosen chyldern y^ are here closed
in clay of this bodily life / And therefore though he be absent fro he^ high hyd
above in ye boso^ of ye fader fulfilled in delyces of ye blessed god head yet
notwithsto^dyng he thinks upon he^ and vysyteth he^ full often through his
gracyous ghostly presence and comforts he^ by his letters of holy wryt. and
dryueth out of her hertes heuines and werines: dowtes and dredes and makes hem
glad and merry in him truly. trowyng to al his behetynges and mekely abidyng
fulfyllyng of his will Saint poul says thus / To. v
Quecu^que scripta su^t ad nostra^ doctrina^ scripta su^t vt per consolacione^
scripturarum sp^e habeamus / Al ye is written to our techynge it is written yt by
comfort of writing we might have hope of salvation / And this is a another
work of co^templaco^n for to see Ihu^ in scryptures after openyng of the
ghostly eye / The clenner the sight is in beholding. ye more comforted is the
affection in tastynge / A full lytyl savor felt in a clean soul of holy wryt
in this manner before said should make the soul set lytyl price by knowing of al
ye vii. arts. or of all the world / of al worldly cu^nynges / For the end of
this knowing is saluaco^n of a man^es soul in everlasting life. and the end
of that other as for hemselfe is but vanytee and a passing delight. but if they
be turned through grace to this end /

Of the pryuevoys of Ihesu sownyng in a soul whereby it shall be known / And
how all the gracyous Illuminaco^ns made in a soul ben called the spekynges of
Ihu^ / Caplm^. xliiii.
LO these are fair new felynges in a clean soul. and if a soul were
fulfilled with such it mye be laid. And sothly yt is were reformed somewhat in
felyng: but not yet fully / For why: yet Ihesu shows more and ledeth the
soul Inner. And begins to speak more homely and more lovely to a soul
then to follow the styryng of grace / For the prophet says / Quocu^que that
spiritus illuc gradiebantur et rote sequentes cum / Eze. i.
wheder so yede ye spyryte thider yede ye whiles following him / By wheles are
understood ye true lovers of Ihu^ For they are round i^ virtue without angyle
of frowardenes. and lightly whyrlyng thorugh redynesse of will to the styryng of
grace / For after that grace styreth and techeth. so they follow and worche as
the prophet says / But they have first a full siker assaye and a true
knowing of the voys of grace or they may do so that they be not deceived by
her own feynyng or by the myddaie fend / Our lord Ihesu says thus of his
lovers / Oues meevocem mea^ audiunt et cognosco eas et cognoscunt me me / My
sheep heren my voys and I know hem and they know me / The preuy voys of Ihesu
is full true. Ioh. x
and it makyth a soul true / There is no feynyng in it ne fantasye ne pride ne
ypocrysy / But softness: meekness: pees: love: and charity. And it is full of
life love and grace And therefore when it sownyth in a soul it is of so great
might sometime that ye soul ^odeynly lays of hand all that there is.
prayenge. spekyng: redynge or thynkyn in the manner before said. and al manner
bodily work and lystnyth thereto fully herynge and preceyuynge in rest and in
love the sweet steven of this goostly voys as. it were rauysshed fro ye mind
of al erdely things / And then^e some time shows Ihu^ in this pees himself
as an hawtful master and sometime as a reverent fader: and sometime as a lovely
spouse / And it kepyth a soul in a wonderful reverence and in a lovely
beholdynge of him that the soul like^h well then. and never so well as then
/ For it felyth so great sykernesse and so great rest in Ihu^ and so much
favor of his goodness that it would ever be so and never do other work / It
think^th that it touchith Ihu^ and through virtue of ye unspeakable touching it
is made hole and stable in itself reverently beholding only Ihu^. as if there
were no thing but Ihu^ oo thing and he a another. borne up oonly by the savor
and ye wondful goodness of him y^ is that thing y^ he felyth and sees / And
this feeling is often times without special beholdynge of holy wryt. ne but
with few words formyd t^ the heart. naught but thus among fallen in sweet
words according to the felyng. either loving or worshyppyng or wondryng. or
otherwise sownyng as the heart lykyth / The soul is full much departed fro
love or lykyng of ye world through virtue of this gracyous feeling / And also
fro mind of the world much in ye mean time / It takith none head thereof for
it has no tym^ thereto / But then sometime anon with this fallyth in to a soul
diverse Illumynaco^ns through grace. y^ which Illumynaco^ns I call the spekynges
of Ihu^ and ye sight of ghostly things / For wit thou well ye all the besynes
yt Ihu^ makyth about a soul. is for to make it a true perfyte spouse to him
in the hynes and fulness of love. And yt may not be done so suddenly therefore
Ihu^ yt is love and of al lovers the wysest assayeth by many wyses and by many
wonderful means or it may come about / And therefore yt it might come to
theffecte of true spousage he has such gracyous spekynges this manner of a
wower to a chose^ soul / He shows his preuy Jewels. much thing he gives
and more he beheteth. and curteys dalyunce he shewyth / Often he vysiteth with
much grace and ghostly comfort as I before said / but how he does this in
specyal al fully can I not tell the for it needs not / Nevertheless so^what shall
I say after that grace styreth / The drawing of a soul fully to perfyte love
is first by ye showing of ghostly things to a clean soul when ye ghostly eye
is openid not that a soul should rest therein. and make an end there but by ye
seche him and love him only that is highest of al without any beholding of any
other thing than himself / But what are these ghostly things say thou. for
I speak often of ghostly things / To this I auswere and say. that ghostly
thing may be said al y^ sothfastnes of holy writ / And therefore a soul
that through light of grace may see the sothfastnes of it. it sees ghostly
things as I have before said /

How through gracyous opening of the ghostly eye a soul is made wise mekely
and sothfastly to se ye dyuersyte of degrees in holy church as trauelyng / And
for to see angels kind and first of repreued / Caplm^ xlv
Nevertheless other ghostly things there ben also ye which through light of
grace are showed of ye soul. and are these / The kind of al reasonable souls.
and the gracyous worchynge of our lord Ihesu in hem / The kind of angels
blessed and reproved and her worchynge and the knowing of ye blessed trynyte
after ye grace techith / Holy writ says i^ ye book of songs of ye spouse
thus / Surga^ and circuibo ciuitate^ and quera^ que^ diligit ai^a mea / I shall
rise and I shall goo about the cite and I shall seche him that my soul loves /
That is: Cant. ^
I shall rise i^ to highness of thought and go about the cite / By this cite is
understood ye university of al creatures bodily and ghostly ordained and ruled
under god by laws of kind of reason and of grace / go about this cite when I
behold the kinds and the cause of bodily creatures the yeftes of grace and
the blyssis of gostly creatures. and in all thise I seche him that my soul
loves / It is foyre lokynge with the Inner eye on Ihu^ in bodily creatnres for
to see his might: his wisdom and his goodness i^ ordinance of her kind: but
it is much fayrer loking on Ihu^ iu ghostly creatures / First in reasonable
souls goth chosen and reproved to see the mercyful calynge of him to chosen.
how he torneth he^ fro syn^e by light of his grace. how he helps he^ techeth
hem: chastyth he^. confortith hem. he righteth he cleanses he fedeth. how he
makes hem bre^nyng in love and in light by plente of his grace / And thus
does he not to one soul only but to al his chosen after mesure of his grace
/ Also of al reproved how ryghtfully he forsakyth hem and leueth hem in her
sins and does hem no wrong / How he rewards hem in this world suffrynge
he^ to have the fulfilling of her will and after to punyssh hem endlesly / Lo
this is a little beholdynge of holy church whiles it is in trauelyng in this
life to seen how black And how foul it semyth in souls that are reproved:
how fair and how lovely it is in chosen souls /

And all this ghostly syghte is naught else but ^he syghte of Ihesu. Not in
himself but in his merciful preuy works and in his ryghtwyse domes every
day showed and remembered and renewed to reasonable souls Also over this to se
with the ghostly eye the pains of reproved: and ye Joy and the bliss of
chosen sowles it is full confortable For sothfastnes may not be seen i^ a clean
soul without great delight and wonderful softnes of blessed brennyng love /
Also the sight of angels kind: first of dampened and after that of the
blessed. It is a full fair contemplacyon of the fend in a clean soul when
grace brings the fe^de to the syghte of the soul as a clumsid caytyf bounden
with the might of Ihu^ that he may not dear / Then the soul beholds him
not bodyly but ghostly seenge his kind and his malice. and torneth him up so
down and spoyleth him and renteth him all to naught. scorneth him and
dyspyseth him and sets naught by his malice. Thus bids holy writ when
it says thus Uerte impium et non erit / Torn the wicked: prouer. xxii.
that is the fend up so down and he shall be as naught. Much wonder has
the soul that the fend has so much malice and so little might. There is
no creature so vnmyghty as he is. and therefore it is a great cowardnes se
that men dreden him so much. He may no thing do without leave of our
lord Ihesu not so much as enter in to aswyne as the gospel says / Much
less may he do then to noye any man / And then if our lord Ihesu give
hem leave to tarry us it is full worthily and mercyfully done that our lord Ihu^
does. and therefore welcome be our lord Ihesu by himself and by all his
messengers / The soul dredeth no more than ye blustrynge of the ^ende than ye
styrynge of a mows / wonder wroth is ye fend if he durst say nay. but his
mouth stopped with his own malyte. his hondes are boside as a the if worthy to
be demid and hanged in hell / And then^e ye soul accusyth him and rytfully
demyth him after yt he has deserved: little. vi
wond not oi^ this saying. for saint poul meaned ye same wha^ he said thus /
Fre^s nescitis qm^ anglo^s iudicabimus / Brethern wot ye not well y^ we shall
deem angels yt are wicked spyrytes through malice yt were made good angels by
kind / As who says yes / This demynge is fygured before the dome in
coute^platyf souls / For they feel a lytyl tasting in lykenes of all yt shall
be done afterward of our lord Ihu^ openly in sothfastnes shamyd and shent is
ye fe^de greatly in himself when he is thus fared with a clean soul. He would
fayn fle a way and he may not for ye myte of ye hiest holds him still. and
ye greuyth him more than all the fire of hell. wonder mekely fallith ye soul
to Ihu^ then with hertly louinges that he somitly saves a simple soul fro
al malice of so fell a enmye by his great mercy.

How by the same light of grace ye blessed angels kind may be see^ And how
Ihu^ is god and man above all creatures after y^ the soul mage see him here /
Caplm^. xlvi.
ANd then after this by the self light may the soul see ghostly ye fayrhede of
angels ye worthiness of hem in kind. the subtylte of hem in substa unce: the
co^fermynge of hem in grace. and ye fullness of endless blise the sou^dryhede of
orders the dystyncco^ns of persons how they live all in light of sothfastnes
endless. and how they bre^ne al in love of the holy ghost after ye worthynes of
orders. how they see and love and praise Ihu^ in blessed rest without ceesynge
/ There is no sight of body: ne no figure in ymaginacyon in this manner worching
but al ghostly. and of ghostly creatures / Then begins ye soul to have
great aqueyntau^ce of ye blessed spirytes and a great felyshyp / They are full
tender and full besy about such a soul to help it / They are masters to
teache it and often through her ghostly presence and towchyng of her light driven
out fantasyes fro ye soul: and they Illymyn ye soul g^acyously. they comfort
ye soul by sweet words suddenly sowned i^ a clean heart / And if any disease
fall ghostly they seruen the soul and mynystre to it all that it needs / Thus
Hebr^. i
saint poul said of he^ / Nonne oe^s sunt administratorii sp^us missi propter
eos q hereditate^ capiu^t salutis / wot ye not well yt holy spyrites are
minysters sent of Ihu^ for hem yt taken ye heritage of health / These are
chosen souls: as who says yes / For wit thou well yt all this gostly worchyng
of words and of reasons brout to ye mind. and such fair lykenes are made by
the mynistery of angels wha^ ye light of grace abu^dantly shines in a clean
^oule It may not be told by ^o^ge ye felynges ye light nynges ye graces and
the co^fortes in specyal ye clean souls perceive through favorable felyshyp of
blessed angels / The soul is well at ease with hem to behold how they done yt
it would tend to no thing else. But then^e with ye help of ye angel yet the
soul sees more for knowing ryseth above all this in a clean soul / And yt is
to behold ye blessed kind of Ihu^ / First of his gracyous ma^hede how it is
hyghed worthily above al angels kind. and then after of his blessed godhede /
For by knowing of creatures is known the creatur. and then begins ye soul
to preceyue a lytyl of the preuytees of the blessed trynyte* It may well enough
for light of grace goth before. and therefore she shall not err aslonge as she
holds her with the light / Then is it opened sothfastly to ye eye of the
soul the only head in substance and dystyncco^n of persons in the blessed
trynite as it may be seen here. and much other sothfastnes of ye blessid
trinyte pertynent to this matere: the which is openly declared and showed by
writynge of holy doctors of holy church / And wit thou well ye the same and
the self sothfastnes of ye blyssyd trinyte yt thise holy doctors Inspyred
through grace written in her books in stre^gthing of our troth a clean soul
may see in knowing through ye self light of grace / I wol not express tomoche
of this matter here specially for it needs not / wond great love felith ye
soul with heavenly delight in felyng of this sothfastnes wha^ it is made through
specyal grace. for love and light goth both together i^ a clean soul / There
is no love yt rises of knowing and of specyal beholgyng yt may towche sooner
our lord as this love may / For why: this knowing is worchiest and hyeste in
itself only of Ihu^ god and man if it be specially showed by ye light of grace
/ and therefore is ye fire of love flaming of this more bren^yng than it is of
knowing of any creature bodily or ghostly. and al thise gracyous knowynges
felyd in a soul of ye university of al creatures in manner before said. and of
our lord Ihu^ maker and keeper of all this fair university. I call he^ fair
words and sweet spekynges of our lord Ihu^ to a soul yt which he wol make
his true spouse / He shewith preuytees and profereth rich yeftes of his
tresour: and arayeth the soul with he^ full honestly / She need not be ashamed
with ye company of her fel^wes to apere afterward to the face of Ihu^ her
sponse / All this lovely daliaunce of preuy speech bytwyxe Ihesu and a soul
may be called an hid word. Job iiii
of yt which holy writ says thus / Porto ad medcin^i est verbum scondi^um
et ve^as susurru percepit auris mea / Sothly to me is said an hid word and
the veins of his rownynges mine eere has perceived / The inspyracyon of Ihesu
is an hid word. For it is preuyly hid from all lovers of the world and
showed to his lovers through which a clean soul perceyueth redily ye veins of
his rownyng that are specially shewenges of his sothfastnes / for eueryche
gracyous knowing of sothfastnes felt with Inly saudur and ghostly delight is a
preuy rownyng of Ihesu in ye ere of a clean soul / Him behooves to have much
cle^nes and mekenes and al other virtues / and to be half deyf to noys of
worldly Ianglyng that should wisely perceive thise sweet ghostly rownynges yt is
ye voys of Ihu^ / Of yt which dauyd says thus / Uox dn^i preparantis ceruos
et reuelabit co^ de^sa / The voys of our lord ihu^ arayeng hertes and he shall
show thycke / That is: P.
the Inpyracyon of Ihu^ makyth souls lyt as hertes yt sterten fro ther^he over
busshes and breres of al worldly vanyte. and he shows to he^ ye thick yt are
his prenites yt may not be perceived but by sharp eye / Thise beholdinges
sothfastly grounded in grace and i^ meknes makes a soul wise and bre^nyng i^
desire to ye face of Ihu^ / Thise are ye ghostly things yt I spoke of before:
and they be^ called new gracyous feli^ges and I do but touch he^ a little for
wyssinge of ye soul / For a so^le yt is clean stired by grace to use of these
werki^g may se more i^ an hour of such ghostly matere than might be written in
a great book /

This finsshyith this present book which expowneth many notable doctrynes in
co^te^placo^n / which as me semyth right expedyent to those that setten their
felycyte in ocupynge theimselfe specially for their soul health /
This is a devout book co^pyled by master Walter hylton to a devout man in
temperal estate how he should rule^ him /
How a man yt wol be ghostly must first vsen much bodyly exercise in penance
and destroyenge of sin: Capitulum / Primum.
Dear brother in christ two manner of states there are in holy church by yt
which christian souls plese^ god and geten hem the bliss of heaven. that one is
bodyly: and that other is ghostly / Bodyly werkyng longs pryncypally to
worldly me^ and wymen the which lefully vsen worldly goods and wylfylly vsen
worldly besynes. Also it longs to all young beginning men the which comen
new out of worldly sins to the service of god: for to make hem able to
ghostly werkyng and for to break down the vnbuxumnes or the body by dyscrecyon
vsen bodyly werkynge yt it might be suple and ready and not mekyl contraryous to
the spyryte in ghostly werkynge. for saint poul says. as woman was made for
man and not man for woman. right so bodyly werkynge was made for ghostly. and
not ghostly for bodyly / Bodyly werkynge goth before and ghostly comyth after
as saint poul says / Non prius quod spirituale. scilicet quod prius ai^ale
dei^desp^uale / And this is a cause why it behooves to be so. for we are borne
in sin and corrupcyon of the felesshe by the whyehe we are so blinded and so
ouerlayed yt we have neither the ghostly knowing of god by light of
understanding. ne ghostly feeling of him by clean desire of loving and
therefore we may not suddenly sterte out of this derke night of this flesshly
corrupcyon in to ye ghostly light / for we may not suffer it ne bear it for
lyknes of ourself no more than we may with our bodyly eyes wha^ they are sore
behold the light of the syn. and therefore we must abide and work be p^ocesse
of time. First by bodily works bestly till we be dyscharged of this heavy burden
of syn^e which lettyth us fro ghostly werkyng. and till our soul be so^ what
^ensed fro great outward syn^^s and abled to ghostly work By this bodily
werkyng yt I speak of may thou vnderst^^^ almaner of god werkis y^ thy soul
does by y^ wits and y^ me^ bris of thy body unto thyself as i^ fasting waki^g
and i^ restraynyng of flesshly lusts by penance doing. or to thyn euencrste^

of al bodily myscheues for ye love of ryghtwysnes / Al these works done in
truth by charity plesen god: withoute^ which they are naught. Than who so
desires for to be occupied ghostly. it is syker and profitable to him y^ he be
first well asayed a long time i^ this bodily werkynge for these bodily deeds
are a token and a showing of moral virtues withouten which a soul is not able
for to work ghostly / Break down first pride i^ bodily beryng and also within
thin heart thynkyng. bostyng and praysyng of thyself vayn lykyng in thyself of
any thing yt god has sent to the bodily or ghostly / Break down also envy
and ire against thyn euencrysten whether they be rich or pore good or bad that
thou hate him not. ne have dysdeyne of him wylfully neither in word ne in
deed. Also break down couetyse of wordly good y^ thou for ye holdyng. getyng
or saving of it offend not thy conscye^ce ne break not charity to god and to
thyn euencrysten for love of any worldly good. but y^ thou getyst to keep it:
and spend it without love and vayn lykyng of it as reason asks in worship of
god and help of thyn euencrysten. Break down also as mekil as thou may
flesshly lykynges either of accydye or bodyly ese gloteny or lechery. and than
when thou have ben well traueyled and well asayed in all such bodily werkis. than
may thou by grace ordeyne the to ghostly werkyng. the grace and ye goodness of
our lord Ihu^ christ that he has showed to y^ in with drawyng of thyn heart
fro lust and lykyng of worldly vanite and use of flesshly sins. and in that
turnyng of thy will enteerly to his service and his plesaunce brings in to mine
heart mekyl matter to love him in his mercy and also it steryth me greatly to
strength the in thy good purpose and in thy werkyng that thou have begun for
to bring it to a good end. if that I could and pryncypally for god and sythen
for tender affection of love that thou have to me if I be a wretch and
unworthy. I know well the desire of thyn heart that thou desyrest gre^ly to
serve our lord by occupacyon all holy withouten lettynge or troublynge of
worldly besynes that thou myghtyst come by grace to more knowing and ghostly
feeling of god and of ghostly things / This desire is good as I hope and of
god for it is set upon him in charity spyrytually. nevertheless it is for to
refreyne and rulen by dyscrecyon as against outward werkynge after the state
that thou art in. for charity vnrewled turns sometime in to vice and therefore
it is said in holy writ / Ordinauit in me carytatem. that is to say / our
lord yeuynge to me charity. set it in order and in rewle that it should not be
lost through mine vndescrecyon / Right so this charity and this desire that our
lord has yeuen of his mercy to the is for to rewle and ordeyn how thou shall
pursue it after thy degree asks. and after the lynynge that thou have used
before time and after the grace of virtues that thou now have. thou shall not
utterly folowen thy desire for to leven occupacyon and besynes of the world
the which are nedeful to vsen in rewlyng of thyself and of al other that aren
vnderthy keeping and give the holy to ghostly occupaco^n of prayers and holy
medytacyons. as it were a friar or a monk. or an other man yt were not bounden
to the world by children and seruau^tis as thou art. for it falls not to
the. and if thou do so. thou kepest not the order of charity. Also if thou
would leven utterly ghostly occupocyon. namly now after the grace that god
has yeuen to the and set the holy to the besynes of the world in fulfyllynge
of the works of actyfe life as fully as an other man that never felyd devotion
/ thou leuest the order of charity / For thy state asks for to do both. each
of hem in diverse times thou shalt meddle the works of actyfe life with
ghostely works of life contemplatyfe / And thanne dooste thou well. For thou
shalt one time be besye with martha for to rewlen and governed thyn household.
Thy children Thy servants. thy neighbors. thy tenauntes. If they done well
comfort hem therein and help hem / If they done evil for to techen hem a mende
hem and chastyse hem / And thou shall also look and know wysly thy thyngis and
thy worldly goods be ryghtly kept by thy servants. governed and truly
spended y^ thou might ye more plenteously fulfill the deeds of mercy with he^
unto thy euencryste^ / Also thou shall with mary leave besynes of y^ world and
sit down at ye feet of our lord by meknes in prayers and in holy thoughts
and in contemplacyo^ of him as he yeueth the grace. and so shall thou go fro ye
one to ye other medfully and fulfill he^ both: and than kepest thou well the
order of charity /

Unto what manner of man longs actyflyf / Caplm^ ii.
Nevertheless y^ thou ne have no wond of this yt I say therefore I shall tell yt
and declare to ye a lytyl more openly thou shall understand yt there is three
manners of living one is actyflyf an other is conte^platyf ye third is made of
both and yt is meddled. Actyflyf above longs to worldly men and wymen ye
which are lewd in knowing of gostly occupacyon for they ne feel savor ne
deuoco^n by fervor of love as other men done. ne they cu^ne no skyl of it. and
yet nevertheless they have dread of god and of ye pain of hell. and therefore
they fle sin and they have desire for to plese god and for to come to heaven
and a good will have to her euencrysten: unto thise men it is nedful and spedful
to vsen ye werkis of actyflyf as besely as they may in ye help of hemself and
of her even christian: for they cu^ne not else done /

Unto who^ longyth conte^platyflyf / Caplm iii
COntemplatyflyfe longs alone to such men and wymen yt for ye love of god
forsaken al open sins of the world and her flesh and albesynes charges and
governance of worldly goodys and maken hemself pore and naked to ye bare need
of ye dodyly kind and flen fro souereynte of al other men to ye service of
god. unto ^hise men it longs for to trauenylen and occupien he^ inwardly for
to get through ye grace of our lord clennes in heart and pes in conscience by
destroyeng of sin and receyuyng of virtues and so for ^o come to
co^templacio^ wha^che cle^nes may not be had without great exercise of body
and co^tynuel traueyle of ye spirit i^ devout prayers fervent desires and
gostly medytacyons /

Unto who^ longs meddled life / Caplm iiii.
THe third life yt is the meddled life lo^geth to men of holy church as to
prelatys and to other curatis ye which have cure and soueryute over other men
for to teache and rewle he^ both her bodies and her souls pryncypally in
fulfyllyng of ye deeds of mercy bodily and ghostly unto thise men it longs
sometime to vsen works of mercy in actyflyf in help and sustinau^ce of he^self
and of her so gettys and of other also. And sometime for to leave al manner of
besynes outward and yeuen he^ unto prayers and medytacyons as redyng of holy
wryt and to other gostly occupaco^ns after yt they felen he^ dysposed. Also it
longs to some te^perel which han souereynte with mekyll aver of worldly
goods. and haven also as it were lordshyp over other men for to govern and
sustain he^ as a fader has over his chyldr^n and a master over his
seruau^tis and a lord over his tenau^tis. the which me^ han also received of
our lords yeft grace of devotion. and in party savor of ghostly occupacyon.
Unto these me^ also longs meddled life yt is both actyf and co^te^platyf. for
if these me^ stondyng ye charge and ye bond yt they have taken wylen leave
utterly ye besynes of the world: y^ which owes skylfully to ben used i^
fulfullyng of her charge and holy yeue^ he^ to co^te^platyf life they do not
well. for they keep not ye order of charity. for charity as thou know well
lyth both in love of god and of thyn euencryste^. and therefore it is y^ he yt
has charity to use both in werkyng now to ye one / and now ye other. for he
y^ for ye love of god in conte^placyon leueth ye love of his euencrysten and
does not to he^ as he aught wha^ he is bound thereto. he fulfyllyth not
charity. also on ye contrary wise who so has so great reward to work of
actyflyf and to besynes of ye world yt for ye love of his eu^ncrysten he
leueth gostly occupaco^n utterly after yt god has dysposed him thereto. he
fulfyllyth not charity / this is ye saye^g of saint gregory. for though our
lord for to styre some to use this meddled life. took upon himself ye person of
such manner men both of prelates of holy chyr and of such other as are
dysposed thereto as I have said: and yaf he^ ensample by his own werkyng yt
they should use this medlyd life as he did y^ time yt he spoke with men and
meddled with he^ sheweng his dedys of mercy for he^ taught ye vncu^nynge and
unknown by his prechyng. he vysited the seek and heled he^ of her dyseses. he
fed the hungry and o^forted ye sorry neuerthels other times he left the
conversation of al worldly men and of his dyscyples and went in to desert upon
ye hyllys and continued al nyt in prayers alone as ye gospel says. therefore
this meddled lyt shewyth our lord in himself to ensample of all other men yt
have taken y^ charge of this medlyd life. yt they should oo time give he^ to
besynes of worldly things at reasonable need and to the werkys of actyflyf in
profyt of her even cryste^ which they have cure of and an other time yeuen he^
holly to devotion and to conte^placyon in prayers and medytacyons /

How holy bishops used meddled life / Caplm v.
THis life ledden holy bishops which had cure of me^nes souls and
mynystracyon of te^perel goods for these holy me^ leften not utterly ye
minystraco^n and the lokyng and y^ dyspendyng of worldly goods and yeuen he^
holy to conte^placyon as mekyl grace of conte^placyon as they had / but they
leften full often her own rest in conte^placyon wha^ y^ they had well ever have been stylle. for love of her even christian. and enter metyd he^ with worldly
besynes in helpyng of her so gettis and sothly yt was charity. for wysly and
dyscretly they departed her living in two / O time they fulfyllyd ye lower
party of charity by werkys of actyflyf. for they were bound thereto by taking
of her prelacye. and an other time they fulfyllyd the higher party of charity
i^ conte^placyon of god and of gostly things by prayers and medytacyons: and
so they hadden charity to god and to her even christian. both in affeccyo^ of a
soul within and also in showing of bodyly dedys withouten. Other men yt were
only contemplatyf. and were fre fro al curys and prelacye. they hadden full
charity to god and to her even christian but it was only in affection of her
soul: and not i^ outward showing. and in hap so mek ylit was ye more full
inward. y^ they myt not. ne it neded not: ne it fyl not for he^ to show it
outward. but these men y^ were in prelacye and other also y^ were ho^y
temper^^ men hadden full charity in affection within and also i^ werkynge and
yt is properly this meddled life. both of actyf and of contemplatyf life. and
sothly for such a man that is in spyrytuell souereynte as prelatis and curatis
ben: or i^ temperel souereynte as worldly lords and masters are. I hold this
meddled life best and most behouely to hem as long as they are bounden thereto /
But to other y^ are fre not bounden to temperel ministracyo^ne to spyrytual I
hope that life contemplatyf alone if they might come thereto sothfastly were
best / most skedful. most medeful. most fair. and most worthy to hem for to
use and to hold and not for to leave it wylfully for any outward werkyng of
actyflyf. but if it were in great need at great releuyng and comfortyng of
other men either of her bodies or of her souls. and than if need ask it at
the prayer and instaunce of other or else at the byddyng of his souereyn: I
hope it be good to show it to he^ in outward werkys of actyflyf for a time
and in helping of her euern christian /

What life most accordyd to him yt this was written to. Caplm vi
By this y^ I have said a party may thou understand which is one and which
is other. and which accordyth most to thy state of living and sothly as me
thinks this meddled life accords most to ye. sythen our lord has ordained
and set ye in the state of souereynte of other men as mekyl as it is and lent
the abundaunce of worldly goods for to reule and sustain specially al thise
y^ are under thy governance. and thy lordship after thy myt and cu^nyng. and
also therewith thou had received grace of ye mercy of our lord for to know
thyself. and gostly desire and savor of his love I hope that this life y^ is
meddled is best and accords most to the. and that for to depart wisly thy
living. for wit thou well if thou leave nedful besynes of actyflyf and be rekles
and taken no keep of thy worldly goods how they are spended and kept ne make
no force of thy so gettis and of thyn even christian by cause of desire and will
y^ thou have only to give the to gostly occupacyon. wenyng yt thou art by y^
excused. if thou do so. thou do not wysly. For what are al thy werkis worth
whether they be bodily or gostli. but if they be done ryghtfully and resonably
to the worship of god and after his bydding. sothly right noght. than if thou
leave y^ thing yt thou art bound to by ye way of charity of right and reason.
and wylt holy give y^ to an other thing wylfully as it were to a more
plesaunce of god which thou art not fully bound to: thou do not worship
discretly to him. thou art besy to worship his head and his face and to array it
fair and curyously. but thou leuest his body with ye feet ragged and rent and
take no keep thereof and there thou worshypest him not for it is velany and no
worship a man for to be curyously arrayed upon his head with peyrles and precious
stones. and al his body naked and bare as it were a beggar. Ryt so gostly it is
no worship to god to crown his head and leave his body bare. thou shall
understand ye our lord Ihu^ christ: as man his head of his gostly body which
is holy church. y^ me^bres of his body are al christian men. some are arms.
some are feet. and some are other me^bres after sundry werkynges y^ they vsen
i^ her living. tha^ if y^ thou be besy with all thy might for to array his head yt
is for to worship himself by mind of his passion and of his other works i^
his manhed by deuoco^n and medytaco^n of hy^ and foryetyst his feet yt are thy
children thy seruau^tis thy tenau^tis and al thyn even cryste^. and letyst he^
spyl for defaute of keeping vnarayed unkept and not tent to as they out for to
be. thou plesyst him not. thou do no worship to him thou make ye to kiss
his mouth by deuoco^n and gostly prayer: but thou tredest upon his feet and
defoulyst hem i^ as much as thou wylt not tent to he^ for neclygence of
thyselfe. y^ which thou have take cure of. thus thinks me. nevertheless if
thou think yt this is not soth. for it were a fair office to worship ye head of
him. as for to benial day occupied in medytacyon of ye manhed. than for to go
lower to other werkys and make clean his feet as for to be besy both in word
and i^dede about ye help of thyn even christian. think not so for sothly he
will more the thank for ye meke wesshyng of his feet when they are right foul
and stynken upon ye. than for all ye precyons peyntyng and arayeng yt thou can
make about his head by mind of his ma^hed. for it is fair enough and needs not
to be^ arrayed of ye mekyl. but his feet and his other me^bres yt are sometime
evil arrayed and had need to be looked and helped by ye na^ly sythe^ thou art
bound thereto. and therefore will he cu^ne ye more thank than if thou wylt
mekely and te^derly look to hem. for ye more lower service yt thou do to thy
lord for ye love of him or to any of his members when need and right asks it
with a glad meke heart: the more plesyst thou him: thynkyng yt it were enough
to y^ for to be at ye lest degree and at ye lowest state sythen it is his will yt
it be so. for it seems sythen he has put ye i^ ye state for to traueyle serve
other men: that it is well done yt thou sholdee fulfill it after thy might. this
ensample I say to the not for thou do not thus as I say. for I hope yt thou
do thus and better: but I would that thou sholdest do thus gladly and not
think both for to leave sometime gostly occupaco^n and entermete yt with worldly
besynes in wise keeping and spendyng of thy worldly goods i^ good reulyng of
thy seruau^tis and of thy tenau^tis and in other good werkis werkyng to all
thyn even christian after thy might. but that thou sholdest do both werkis in
diverse times and with as good will that one as that other if thou mygh^est. As
if thou had prayed and ben occupied ghostly thou shall after reteyn time /
break of that and than shall thou bestly and gladly occupy ye in some bodyly
occupacyon to thyn even christian / And also when thou have ben besy outward
awhyle with thy seruau^tis or which other men profitably thou shall break of and
torn again to thy prayers and thy deuocyons after god yeueth y^ grace and so
shall thou put away by grace of our lord slothe ydylnes and vain rest that
comes of thy flesh under color of conte^placyon and lets ye sometime fro
medful and spedful occupacyon in outward besynes and thou sha^^^ be aye well
occupied bodyly or gostly and therefore if thou would do well thou shall do gostly
as Jacob did bodyly. holy wryt says yt Jacob when he began to serve his
master laban. he coueytyd rachel his masters daughter to his wife for her fair
head. and for her he served seven year but when he wend for to have had her to
his wife: he had first lya y^ other doughte^ (...) stead of rachel. and
afterward he took rachel and so he had both at ye last. By Jacob in holy wryt
is vnderstonden an ouercomer of sins. by these two wives are understood as
saint gregory says. two lives in holy church actyf life and conte^platyf life.
lya is as much for to say as traueylous. and betokens actyf life. rachel is
as much to say as sight of begyn^yng y^ is god. and betokens life
conte^platyf. lya bare chyl^ren. but she was sore yed. rachel was fair and
lovely. but she was barayn. than right as Jacob coueytyd rachel for her fayrhed
and yet had her naught when he would. but first he took lya and afterward
rachel. Right so each man traueylynge sothfastly in conpu^ccyon by grace for
sins of ye world and of ye flesh to serve god in clen^es of good living.
has great desire to have rachel y^ is for to have rest i^ gostly swetnes i^
deuoco^n and conte^placyo^. for it is so fair. and so lovely. and in hope for
to have y^ life only he dysposed him to serve our lord with all his might / but
often when he wend to have had rachel. y^ is rest in devotion: our lord
suffered him to ben asayed well in tryueyle with lya. y^ is either te^ptacyons of
ye world or else of the devil. or of his flesh. or else with other worldly
besynes bodyly or ghostly in helping of his even christian and when he is well
traueyled with lya and nerhonde onercome. than our lord yeueth him rachel yt
is grace and devotion and rest in conscience and than has he both rachel and
lya. So shall thou do after ensample of Jacob take these two lives actyf and
conte^platyf sythen god has sent ye both and use y^ one with y^ other. By
that ^o life shall thou bring forth fruit of many good deeds in help of thyn
even christian: and is yt by actyf. and by ye other thou shall be made fair
bright and clean. in the souereyn bryghtnes yt is god begynner and ender of al
yt is made: and than shall thou be sothfastly Jacob and ouergoer and ouercomer
of al sins. and after this by grace of god thy name shall be changed as
Jacobs ^ame was and turned in to isrl. Israel is as much for to say as a man
seeing god. the^ if thou be first Jacob and dyscretly wylt use these two lives
in time thou shall after be isrl y^ is very contemplatyf either in this life if
he will deliver the and make the fre fro chargys and besyness is the which thou
art (...)de to: or else after this life full in the bliss of heaven wha^ thou
come thither. A man shall desire contemplatyf for it is fair and medful.
therefore thou shall ay have it i^ thy mind and in thy desire: but thou shall
have in vsyng actyf life for it is so nedeful and so spedful. therefore if thou
be put fro rest in devotion wha^ thou had lever be still thereat. either by
thy children or by thy seruau^tis or by any of thyn even christian for her profyt
or ese of her heart is skylfully asked: be not angry with hem ne heavy ne dredful
as though god would be wroth with the that thou leuest him for any other thing.
for it is not so. leave of lightly thy devotion whether it be in prayer or
medytacyon and go do thy deed and thy service to thyn even christian as lytly as
our lord himself bad the. do so and suffer mekely for his love without
grutchyng if thou may or dysese or trowblyng of thyn heart by cause of
medlyng of such besynes /

That a man shall sometime have the more devotion when he has be lettyd by
outward werkys / Ca / vii.
FOr it may fall sometime yt ye more troublyng y^ thou have outward with actyf
werkis: the more brennyng desire thou shall have to god and ye more clear sight
of gostly things by grace of our lord in devotion when thou come thereto.
for it faryth thereby as if thou had a lytyl cole and thou would make a
fire therewith and make it to brenne. thou would first lay to styckis and
ouerhyle the cole with the styckis nevertheless when thou have abyden a while
and afterward blowest a lytyl. a none shall spring out a great flawme of fire
for the styekis are al turned to fire. Right so is gostly thy will and thy
desire yt thou have to god. it is as it were a lytyl cole of fire in thy soul.
for it yeueth to the so^what of light and of ghostly hete. but it is full lytyl.
for often it waryth cold and turns to flesshly rest and so^time in to
ydelnes therefore it is good yt thou put to styckes that are good werkis of
actyf life and though it be so yt these works as it semyth for a time let thy
desire yt it may not be so clean ne so fervent as thou would be not to
dredful therefore but abide and suffer a while and so blow at ye fire yt is
first goo and do thy werkis and after goo tha^ alone to thy prays and
medytacyons. and lift up thyn heart to god and pray him of his goodness yt he will
accept thy works yt thou do to his plesau^ce. hold he^ as naught in thyn
own sight but only at his mercy be a know mekely thy wretchydnes and thy
feelte and arecte sothfastly thy good deeds to him in as mekyl as they are good
and in as mekyl as they are bad and not done dyscretly with all cyrcu^staunces
yt are nedeful to a good deed for defaute of descreco^n: put he^ to thyself.
and than for this mekenes shall al thy good deeds turn i^ to a flame of fire.
as styckes is laid upon a cole. and so shall thy good deeds outward not hyndre
thy deuoco^n but rather make it more And more over our lord says in holy wryt
thus / Ignis in altari meo se^per ardebit et sacerdos surgens mane subiciet
ligna vt ignis no^ extynguatur / Fire shall ever bren in mine auter and the pressed
rysyng at morrow shall put under styckes yt it be not quenched this fire is love
and desire to god in a soul. ye which loves for to be norysshed and kept by
laye^g to ye sticks yt it go not out. these styckes are so douers matters some
are of o tree and some are of an other. a man that is lettered and has
understanding of holy wryt if he have this fire of devotion in his heart. it is
good to him to get him styckes of holy ensa^ples and devout prayers and
norysshe ye fire with he^. An other man unlettered may not so redely have at
his hand holy writ ne doctors saying and therefore it needs to him for to
do many good deeds outward to his even christian and kyndel the fire of love
with hem And so it is good that each man in his degree after that he is
dysposed that he get him styckes of o thing or of other. either prayers or
medytacions or redyng in holy wryt or good bodyly werkis for to norysshe ye
fire of love in his soul. that it be not quenched for the affection of love is
tender and lightly will vanysshe away but if it be well kept. and by good deeds
bodyly and ghostly contynuelly norysshed. Now chanue sythen our lord has sent
in to thyn heart a lytyl spark of this blyssed fire that is him self as holy
writ says /

Dominus noster ignis consumens est / Our lord god is fire wasting / for as
bodily fire wastes al bodyly thing yt may be wasted. right so ghostly fire yt
is god wastith al manner of syn^e. and therefore our lord is lykned to fire
wastyng. I pray ye norysshe this fire. this fire is not else but love and
charity. this has he sent in to ye earth as he says i^ ye gospel / Igne^ veni
mittere i^ terra^ and ad quid nisi vt ardeat. I am come^ to se^de fire i^to ye
earth. and whereto but yt it should bre^ yt is god has sent fire of love and a
good desire and a great will for to plese him in to man's soul. and unto this
end y^ and man shall know it: keep it and noryssh it and strength it / and
thereby be saved ye more desire yt thou have to hy^ and for hi^ / ye more is ye
fire of love in ye. and the less that this desire is in the. the less is the
fire / ye mesure of this desire how mekyl it is neither in thyself or any other
know thou not. ne no man of himself but god only y^ yeueth it. and therefore
dyspute not with thyselfe as though thou would know how mekyl thy desire is.
be besy for to desire as mekyl as thou may / but not for to wit ye mesure of
desire /

What is desire to god for himself and how in clennes of conscience is very
comfort and swetnes / Ca / viii.
Saint austyn says yt the life of every good christian man is a contynuel desire
to god. and that is of great virtue ^or it is a great cryeng in ye eres of god
ye feruentlyer thou desyrest. the higher thou cryest ye better thou prayest ye
wiselyer thou thynkest. and what is this desire. sothly no thing butlo thing
of all this worlds bliss. of al flesshly liking in thyn heart. a wonderful
loving with a restful yernyng of endless bliss and heavenly Joy. this thing may
be called a desire to god for himself. if thou have this desire as I hope
sikerly yt thou have. I pray y^ keep it well and norysshe it wysly. and when
thou shall pray or think make this desire beginning and endyng of al thy work
for to encrece it. look after none other feling i^ thy bodyly wits. ne seek
after none other bodyly swetnes neither sownyng ne sauouryng / ne wondfullyt ne
angels sight ne though our lord himself as unto thy sight would apere to ye
bodily charge it but a lytyl but that al thy besynes be y^ thou mytest feel
sothfastly thy thout a lothyng and a full forsakyng of al manner of sin and of
all manner of uncleanness with a ghostly sight of it how foul how ugly and how
paynful it is and that thou myghtest have a mighty desyryng to virtues and to
meknes and to charity and to ye bliss of heaven: this thinks me were ghostly
comfort and ghostly swetnes in man's soul as for to have celennes i^
conscience fro wyckednes of al worldly vynyte with stable troth meke hope. and
full desire to god. how so ever that it be of other comfortis and swetnessis me
thinks that swetnes syker and sothfast that is feled in cle^nes of conscience
by mighty forsakyng and lethyng of al syn^e and with inward sight and fervent
desire of ghostly things / Al other comfortis and swetnessys of any manner of
feeling but if they help and led to this end. that is to clennes of
conscience and ghostly desire of god: are not syker to rest on / But now ask
thou whether this desire be love to god: as unto this I say that this desire
is not properly love. but it is a beginning and a tastyng of love. for love
properly is a full cowpelynge of the lover and they loved together. as god and a
soul in to one. this cowpelyng may not be fully had in this life but only in
desire and longyng thereto as by this ensample. If a man love an other man
which is absent: he desires greatly his presence. Right so ghostly as long as
we are in this life our lord is absent fro us yt we may neither se him ne here
him ne feel him as he is: and therefore we may not have ye use of this full love
here in full lykyng. but we may have a desire and a great yernyng for to be
present to him for to se him in his bliss and fully for to be oned to him in
love: this desire may we have of his yefte in this life. by the which we shall
be safe. for it is love unto him as it may be had here. thus saint poul says
Scientes qm^ du^ sumus i^ hoc corpore pegrinamur a dn^o per fide menim
ambulamus and non pec sp^em. audemus and bonam voluntatem he^mus magis
peregrinari a corpore and presences e^e ad deu^. and io^ contendimus sieve
absentes sieve presents placere illi / Saint poul says that as long as we are
in this body. we are pilgrims fro our lord yt is we are absent fro heaven in
this excile we goo by troth not by sight. yt is we live in truth not in
bodily feeling. we dare and we ^^^ue a good will to be absent fro the body and
be present to god. y^ is we for clennes in conscience and syker trust of
saluacyo^ dare desire partyng fro our body by bodily death and by present to our
lord. nevertheless for we may not yet therefore we stryuen whether we be absent
or present for to plese him. y^ is we strive ayens sins of ye world and
lykyng of ye flessh by desire to him. for to bren in the fire of desire all
thing yt lettyth us fro him / But yet ask thou me. may a man have this
desire in his heart co^tynuelly. y^ thinks nay as unto this I may say as me
thinks yt this desire may be had as for virtue and profyt of it i^ heart
co^tynuelly. but not in werkyng ne vsyng as by this ensample if thou were seek
thou sholdest have as each man has a kyndely desire of bodily hele contynuelly
i^ thyn heart what yt thou dedyst whether thou sleep or wake but not aye ylyke.
for if thou sleep or wake and thynkest on some worldly things. than thou have
thy desire in heart only and not in werkyng. but wha^ thou thynkest on thy
bodyly syknes and on thyn hele. tha^ thou have it i^ vsyng. right so it is
gostly of desire to god. he yt has this desire of ye yeft of god if he sleep
or else think not on god. but on worldly things: yet he has this desire i^
heart i^ his soul till yt he syn dedly. but anon as he thinks on god or on
cle^nes of living or of joys of heaven: tha^ werketh his desire to god as long
as he keeps his thought and his intent to plese god either i^ prayers or in
medytacion or in any other good deed. yt al his besynes be for to stere his
desire and use it by dyscreco^n now in oo deed now in an other after he is
dysposed and has grace thereto. this desire is root of al thy we^kynge if it
be medeful. for wit thou well what good deed yt thou do for god. bodily or
ghostly. it is an using of this desire when thou prayest or thynkest doubt not
than if thou desire god. and therefore when thou do a good deed or thynkest
on god: dout not thynkyng i^ thyn heart whether thou desyrest or not. for thy
deed shows thy desire. Some are vncunnyng and wene yt they desire not god but
if they ever be cryenge on god with words of her mouth the hele. lykyng ay
lastyng wysdom. love. pees. worship. sykernes. rest joy. and bliss ynought
ever withouten end / the more fervently shall thou desire the joy and ye rest
of yt blyssed life. Many men are covetous of worldly catel and worshyppes and
erthly riches and think now dremyng now waking how and by what means they
might come thereto. and therefore they foryeten the mind of he^self. and the
peynes of hell and the joys of heaven. sothly they are not wys. they are like
to children yt renne^ after butterflyes and for they look not to their feet.
they fall sometime sone down and breken her leggis: What is all the poupe and the
worship of this world in riches or in iolyte but a butterflye. sothly no thing
ellis. and yet mekyl less. therefore I pray ye be thou coueytous of ye Joys of
heaven. and thou shall have worship and riches yt ever shall last. For at the
last end when worldly coueytous men bring no good in her hondis for all her
worshyppes and al her rychessys are turned into naught sa^ sorrow and pain:
tha^ shall worldly men yt forsake trewly al vayn worshyppes and rychessys of
this world. or else if they have riches and worshyppes they setten naught by
hem. ne they setten not her love ne lykyng in hem but live ever in dread and in
mekenes and in hope and sometime in sorrow and abyden ye mercy of god pacyently
they shall than have fully y^ they he^e coueyted. for they shall be crowned as
kings and stye up with our lord Ihu^ in to the bliss of heaven / Also there
ben many other medytacyons mo than I can say which y^ god puts in to a
man^es mind for to styre the affection and ye reason of man's soul to loathe
vanytees of this world and for to desire the Joys of heaven. These words I
say not to the as I had fully showed the y^ manner of medytacyons as they are
wrought in a man's soul. but I touch he^ to the a little y^ thou myghtest by
this have more understanding /

How a man shall do when he felyth no savor ne comfort in his medytacyons /
Caplm xv.
Nevertheless me thinks it is good to the ye wha^ thou dysposyst the to think
on god as I have before said or on otherwise and perauenture thou felyst no
savor ne devotion in thy thinking but oonly a naked mind and a weyke will: yt
thou would feign think on god. but thou can not than I hope it is good to
the yt thou strive not to mekyl with thyself for thou myghtest so lightly fall
it too more derknes but if thou were more sly in thy werkyng: and therefore I
hold it most syker unto y^ for to say thy pater noster and thyn Aue. or ellis
thy matynes or else for to read upon thy sauter. for y^ seuermore a syker
standarde yt will not fail. who so may cleue thereto he shall not err. and if
thou may by thy prayer get devotion. look than this devotion be only in
affection yt is to say in great desire to god with ghostly delight. hold forth
tha^ thy saying and break not lightly of. for often it fallyth yt prayeng with
ye mouth. getyth and keeps devotion. and if a man cese of saying devotion
vanyssheth away / Nevertheless if devotion of prayers bring in to thyn heart a
devout thought of the manhed of our lord or of any of the other before said:
and this thought should be let by thy saying tha^ may thoncese of thy
saying and occupye the with medytacyon till it pass away /

Where of a man needs ^o be ware i^ medytacon / Caplm xvi.
BUt of certain things the behoneth to beware in thy medytacyons some shall I
tell ye. One is when thou have had a gostly thought or ymagynacyon of the manhed
of our lord or of such bodyly things. and thy soul has been comforted and
fed there with. and it passyth away by theself. be not to besy to hold it still
with maystry. for it is than turned to pain and to bytternes. also if it pass
not away but dwell still in thy mind withouten any traueyle of thyself. and
thou for comfort of it will not leave it. and therefore it reueth the of thy sleep
in nyghtes. or ellis i^ days fro other good deeds. or else for great fervor
of thy body: thy body or thyn head fallyth into great febylnes. than shall thou
wylfully break of wha^ time comes. sometime when thou have most devotion and
were lothest for to leven it as when it passyth reasonable time or else it
turns to dysese of thyn enencrysten. But if thou do so thou do not well as
me thynkith ne wysly neither / A worldly man or woman that felyth not
perauenture devotion twyes in a year. if he feel by the grace of our lord
Ihesu great co^punccion for his sins. or else have mind on the passion of
our lord. if he were put fro his sleep and his rest o night or two or three
until his head work. ^t is no force. for it comes to he^ but seldom. but to
the or to an other man yt has the manner of werkynge in custom as it were each
other day. it is spedful for to have dyscrecyon in your werkyng and not fully
fall thereto for to follow it as mekyl as will comen I hold yt it is good to
the to vsen this manner in what devotion y^ thou be that thou hang not to long
thereupon either to put the fro thy mete or fro thy sleep in time or for to
dysese any other man vnskylfully. the wise man says thus / Oi^a te^pus habe^t
/ Al things han time / An other thing is this y^ the behooves to be ware of
that is when thy thought has be^ occupied in ymagynacyon of the manhed of our
lord or in any such other. and after this thou art besy with all ye desire of
thyn heart for to seek knowing or felyng more gost^y of the godhed. prese not
to mekyl thereon. ne suffer not thy desyrene thi^ heart tarry to long therein.
as if thou were abiding after ome quaynte styrynge or wonderful f^lynge other
tha^ thou have had before time / thou shall not do so it is enough to the and
to me for to have a desire and a longing to our lord and if he will of his
grace freely over this desire send us of his gostly light and open our ghostly
eye for to know more of him tha^ we han had before by common traueyle. thank
we him thereof. and if he will no^ for we are not yet meke enough or ellis we are
not dysposed by clennes of living in other sides to receive yt grace. tha^ shall
we mekely know our own wretchydnes and hold us paid with desire yt we have
to him and with other common thoughtys that mow lightly fall under our
ymagynacyon. as of our sins: or crystes passion or such other. or else with
prayers or of ye sauter or some other. and love him with all our heart yt he wol
give us any part of his grace / And if thou do otherwise thou may lightly be
begyled by ye spyryte of error for thy presumpcyon. for it is great folly a man
