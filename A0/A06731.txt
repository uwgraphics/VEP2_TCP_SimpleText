ENGLANDS LOOKING IN AND OVT. Presented to the High COURT of PARLIAMENT now
Assembled.

By the Author R. M. Knight.

LONDON, Printed by T. Badger for H Mosley, and are to be sold at his Shop at
the Princes Arms in Saint Paul's CHURCHYARD 1640.

The humble request of Sir Ralph Maddison KNIGHT, to the Honorable House of
COMMONS, Die Martis primo Decembris 1640.
THat it would please this Honorable Assembly of the House of Commons, to
take into their consideration the decay of our Kingdoms commodities, and
especially the Wools of this kingdom of late years much decayed in price;
which (if it continue) will assuredly pull down the revenue of King and
subject, to the unspeakeable loss of all in general.

Which your humble petitioner conceives to come by two special or principal
ways or means, both of them worthy of your High and Noble consideration;
namely, the overballancing of Trade in commerce with Strangers, And the
marchandizing Exchange by bills used between us and strangers; both which do
tend to, and in truth do drive out our kingdoms Coin both Gold and Silver
for the making up the unequal and prejudicial balance of Trade, and the
Usurious and Canker-eating contracts daily practiced between us and strangers,
and especially the Bankers the first movers therein.

And because the words (balance of Trade, or commerce and marchandizing
Exchange) must of force be mentioned because they are the words of art of
science well known to many in this Honorable Assembly, who have been versed
by Trade or Travel in foreign parts: Yet because I suppose there be more here
assembled that have not been ver^ed, or given their mind to Marchandizing
business; I humbly crave pardon, if I be bold (for the help of all men's
understanding herein) to explain these words in as few words as I can.

And first, of (Balance) all men do know what it means in buying and
selling at home, but the word (Trade) put thereto, is obscure, till it be
opened.

Balance of Trade then, is the computation, or taking the account or valuation
of all the merchandise exported or imported into this kingdom every year;
which (being cast up) may tell us whether we get or lose, or what loss or
gain comes to the kingdoms Commerce that year the Balance is cast up. And
if it be found that we import more than we export, then that which does want of
making the balance equal, must be fulfilled with our kingdoms stock or
store of money; which (in process of time) will eat up, or consume (to a small
portion) our moneys that should beat or maintain our home-commerce and
markets; (per consequence) lessen the prices of our Woolls, Corn, Lands, and
what not? for this is infallibly true in common sense, that where much money
is, there the prices are greater; and where little money is, there the prices
of all things are less, and go low. Hence it was, and will be said this
proverb, Regina pecunia donat, for money will bear rule in price in despite
of all men that say no. But I do conjecture (as some have said to my self)
some in this assembly will say; How is it possible that all goods or
merchandise, going out of this Realm and coming in should be accounted? This
is a thing that to some wise men does seem impossible. To this I answer, It is
no new thing, that the valuation or rate or price of all goods going out and
into this Realm, has been put into books duly kept in every port of this
kingdom, and once a year at a certain time all brought into the Kings
remembrancers office in the Exchequer, and there to be collected and made up
into one gross sum of all out bound and another gross sum of all in bound
goods; whereby the King might (as in a mirror) see the face of his common
weal whether it grew fat or lean; And this (under favorable correction be it
spoken) was one amongst other causes wherefore custom of old was due to the
King by common reason or law, for maintenance of the officers that attended
this care in every Port, and is so ancient as in Henry the third his time it
was called (the old custom:) before all memory of Record: This may suffice in
brevity for the words, Balance of Trade.

Secondly, the word exchange, all know what it is to make a change;
Marchandizing Exchange is known only to Merchants, and those that in foreign
Travel have used it: And few of either sort do know the par or equal
exchange of Coins between forrainers and us.

Exchange of Merchants was first invented for saving of portage and keeping of
moneys at home in every kingdom, beside the hazard that might befall in
carrying of Treasure (as luggage) from kingdom to kingdom, which otherwise,
upon every several contract (made to be paid forrainly) would be exported;
and every Traveller beyond the Seas should carry his expending money with him.
But now, if by equal or disadvantageous exchange a man deliver an hundred
pounds here to be paid so much like quantity of gold or silver again there
beyond Seas; this both keeps the money at home. But if by unequal exchange a
gain may be had by overvaluing of our money beyond Seas, as now they be
overvalued, especially in France, not only a Merchant making contract as
aforesaid, or a Traveller not knowing the mystery, shall lose ten or more in
the hundred. And the Merchant observer of the mystery, (for the gain had
thereby) export the money in specie, but more especially gold, when visibly
without change of species he may retain ten of those pieces and more in the
hundred, and there with ninety pieces pay the hundred pieces received here; and
this is the overt or open fallacy, now too frequently in France practiced upon
or by the denomination of that coin: But there is another more secret which is
practiced by Exchangers to be considered from the finenesse of the coin;
wherein is to be noted, that all Princes coins are not alike, for some have
more Ailay or Copper mixed with the gold or silver, which were a long discourse
to enter into, and upon agitation of this business of Exchange, will be opened
sufficiently there being only two chief ways of deceit; denomination, or open
deceit; The second, intrinsicke or inward value, consisting in the mixture of
Copper more or less put into the gold or silver.

It is not unknown that there be other great causes which do hinder our
prizes and procure damage to our home commodities; namely, exportation of Gold
and Silver, diversion of bullion and home-consumption of gold and silver,
Inhancing of our moneys Gold and Silver in foreign parts, and especially in
France as aforesaid, and homebred monopolian practices; all which will fall
into consideration upon the handling of the two first causes above said.

Whereupon my humble request is you would be pleased to cause the Balance of
Trade to be truly cast up and presented unto you with all speed, as also to
take notice how the exchange goes between us and foreign Merchants. And (if
both be found prejudicial) to set such convenient remedy as has been
formerly in ancient time used, or by your grave wisdoms be found more
agreeable to these modern times; And he shall ever rest a devoted servant
unto our King and Country, with his hearty prayers for prosperity of both.

R. M.

DREAD Sovereign, and Right Honorable Lords, with the Honourabl House of
Commons: For unto you all, I humbly present these my Labors, (for that it does
concern every one, from the King to the Beggar) expecting neither profit nor
praise for the same, Ministerium oblatum ne sordescat. My single duty bind th
me, (as a member in a Ship in time of distress,) to put to my hand to work in
the same.

One of the Leakes in this Ship or house, is the running out or leaking of our
moneys into other lands by way of overballancing in Trade or Marchandizing
Exchange, or both; the two principal causes of our trades decay, and want of
moneys.

And for that Marchandizing Exchange is mystical, and full of secret deceit,
chiefly nourished and directed by the Bankers or lenders of moneys beyond Seas
for unconscionable gain; and (by secret or close conveyance) to work out and
carry away our bullion or moneys in specie, as it has been diverse years, and
yet is visibly seen in France, and other parts beyond the Seas; Therefore
(imitating herein the wisest of men) I shall seek out plain and easy words
to express the same; not tying my self to the words of Art, thereby
endeavoring to facilitate, and make the difficulty thereof easy to every man's
understanding not versed therein, (if they have a desire:) Wherein I shall
observe the Method of the wisest Instructor, who first created the light to
enlighten the succeeding world, and after manifested the creatures by the same;
So I shall (God willing) first open the use of the Merchant Exchange, and after
set forth some abuses of the same to all men's understanding, and lastly, the
remedy. So, praying to God to prosper your labors in all happiness, I rest
Your humble and devoted Subject and Servant.

Ralphe Maddison Knight.

IN the first place then it behooveth to show the composing of the weight of
silver and gold; Silver weight is thus composed: A pound Troy contains twelve
ounces; an Ounce contains twenty penny weight, a penny weight contains
twenty four grains of wheat, taken out of the midst of the wheat ear, et
e converso, 24. grains taken out of the middst of the wheat ear do make a
penny weight; twenty penny weight do make an ounce, and twelve ounces do make
a pound Troy.

Where note, that a pound Tail is but four ounces, which before King Henry
the Sixth his time, was all one with the pound Troy, he then did raise it by
prerogative to 30. pence the ounce, which caused the price of an ounce of
silver to pass at that price in current payment betwixt man and man; and a
pound weight Troy to pass at 30s which before was but 20s. Thus by dividing
the ounce Troy into so many more pieces, he lost so much in his revenues,
customs, and other duties belonging to him, as he had multiplied the pence in
number, and this is called, raising the Coin in denomination.

And in success of time, between Henry the Sixth, and the beginning of Edward
the sixth his time, the ounce was raised to sixty pence, and so it remained
ever since constant, notwithstanding the raising of it in foreign parts; for
it was found by experience of our former raisings, that raising of the ounce
weight, was but a temporary remedy to keep the moneys at home, and stood no
longer then they raised again beyond Seas; This may suffice for the weight of
silver, consisting now of sixty pence the ounce, twelve ounces to the pound
Troy.

The gold pound being the same in weight with the silver is otherwise composed
in other terms; as thus, The Gold casts away the name of penny weight, thus,
A pound weight of Troy of pure Gold is said to be 24. Carrats, and every
Carrat contains four grains, two Carrats and an ounce are one weight, a
grain and half a quarter of an ounce are one weight.

Next follows in order to know the Composition of the mixture or finenesse of
Gold and Silver; and first, of Silver, because it is the common market man both
at home and abroad.

Here is to be noted that no monyes be made of pure Silver in no Mints, the
reason is, because in its pureness and purity the Silver is as flexable as lead
almost, and therefore not so useful in its purity, as when it is something
hardened with Copper; even so it is with Gold. There is no pure Gold minted in
any place I know of, but has some Allay or Copper, and if it has been
heretofore, it is so ancient that no memory thereof remains to us; and if it
were at any time done so, the alteration began with some Prince that meant and
did deceive others with so doing: for it is a powerful means to fetch his
neighbors Coins from them to be minted in his mints; which being perceived,
his neighbors did mix their Coins also, thinking thereby to fetch theirs home
again by the same means it went away; but (as it is before said of
denomination;) so then and now it falls out to be the same in imbasing the
Coin, as it was or is in denomination; but a temporary remedy and to no
purpose but hurt, as I shall tell you hereafter, when I come to speak of the
inconveniences of raising the Coin by denomination or debasing of it by Allay
or Copper, which be all one in effect and works alike.

So then you having the weights of silver and gold in your understanding and
memory; it remains to let you know that almost all Princes coins do differ
in finenesse or mixture, few do agree just together, insomuch as Spain having
four Mints or more under his command, two in the West Indies Mexico and Perue,
and two in the Continent of Spain, Lisbon and Sivile, yet all four differ in
finenesse one from the other something, for which there is some reason to be
given in its proper time: So likewise there is some difference in finenesse in
other Princes Coins, as between us and France, and the Low Countries,
Arch-Duches, and united Provinces, Lubecke, Hamborough, Stoad, and the
Imperial Cities of Germany.

And for this cause of differences, ours consisting of Eleaven ounces two penny
weight fine, FRANCE of Eleaven ounces fine, Low Countries of ten ounces, and
some of nine ounces-fine in the pound Troy.

It behooves us who have the finest Standard or mixture of silver in our
monyes, to beware that our fine monyes be not drawn out from us to maintain
the baser mints; for if denomination have a power to work that effect; much
more has embasing of Coin being not so easily perceived as the other, and to
watch over them in all places, least we be deceived by any of them.

But some will say; what need we be put to trouble to watch others, cannot
we more easily do as others do?

To this I answer, if there were no harm in so doing at home, yet to alter
with them that alter or may alter, requires a continual watch over all others
with whom we have commerce, or else, how should we know when they alter, or
know what mynt it is that draws our monyes from us? and if we should alter
our mint as often as others may alter, we should ever be altering and have no
rest at home; this, perconsequence must needs bring a confusion in short time,
when once moving our mynt has made great alterations amongst us at home, and
will ever do so when we shall alter; It is the greatest harm to King and
Subjects, as shall be showed (God willing) hereafter.

In the mean time, give me leave to let you know, that in or about the year
of our Lord one thousand five hundred fifty and five, we being in amity with
all Princes and neighbour-mynts, there was a general consent amongst Princes
and States to make a Treaty for the Concord in Mynt affairs, to keep a
paritie in Coins, which treaties were frequent in elder times, but now, (by
reason of wars near hand, in France, Low Countries, and Germany) is omitted.

And in King HENRY the eight, his time, there is mention made of a Treatise
between the KING and the Arch-duches of Austria, wherein it was found that the
difference of an half penny in an Angel of Gold (which now is about three
pence in the pound tale) it would be sufficient to exhaust his treasure out of
his kingdom, and by no means would suffer it.

Then per consequence what do they which at this time do raise both Gold and
Silver, twenty in the hundred above others?

The answer to this is, they do break the Law of Nations, which is a just
cause of War amongst Princes, to go about to draw away their neighbors
coin by inhancing, by denomination, or debasing the finenesse by Allay, for
all make one effect as aforesaid.

But what care they to break the law of nations that purpose to have War?
then this is answered for that; and must we then of consequence have our moneys
exhausted (as they are) or make War, and by the next consequence be undone,
is there none other remedy? There is, but I refer the remedy till another
time and place.

Now I have laid open the composing of the weight and finenesse of Gold and
Silver, I am to show the cause of exporting of our Gold and Silver, before
aremedy can be applied.

And this is a secret to most men to know the cause, and will be controverted
by them that have profit thereby; and if we believe them that controvert it, the
cause is lost; herein is to be noted, what Ecclesiastes (as concerning Merchant
Exchange says: Trust not a Merchant in the business or touching Exchange, a
Labourer, in the point of hyre, nor a soldier in the ending of wars.

Bear in remembrance the weight and finenesse of our own Coin especially,
without which knowing and remembering, you cannot fall upon nor understand the
true cause of exhansting of our monyes, which is the marchandizing Exchange,
nor yet the remedy; Therefore I pray you pause upon that which has been said a
while, unless you have been versed or do understand the mint business, and
composing of Gold and Silver, which has been declared in some measure.

Also take this with you for a principle; moneys can neither be advanced in
denomination, nor a pound Troy or an ounce be made into more pieces of Silver,
nor debased by putting in more Copper or Allay, without general detryment to
the Respublike: A perilous thing to deal withal without doubt, and most
especially in Land Commonweals.

And wherefore more in land common wealths, then in maritime and Marchandizing
Commonweals? I must tell you, or you will not believe.

Maritime and Merchants can immediately change with the Changer, without
detriment; The Merchant can immediately set a price of his Merchandise,
according to the worth of the money; and the Artificer and Labourer set a price
accordingly to his labor or hire; which cannot be done in terraine State, more
especially in our Kingdom; which I forbear for the present, till I show the
inconveniences or mischiefs that would follow the alteration of our mynt, and
will be most pernicious to undertake any such thing.

And for that I have already named the Merchant Exchange to be the efficient
cause of exhausting our moneys in general, thus it is; Merchants Exchange was
first invented for the saving of portage, and keeping of moneys at home in
every kingdom, besides the hazard that might befall in carrying of Treasure
(as luggage) from kingdom to kingdom, which otherwise upon every several
contract (made to be paid forraignly) would be exported; And every traveller
beyond the Seas would carry his expending money with him.

But now, (if by equal or disadvantagoeus Exchange) a man deliver an hundred
pounds here, to be paid so much like quantity of Gold or Silver again there
beyond Seas; this both keeps the money at home, and saves the Traveller a
labor and hazard in carrying the money over.

But if (by unequal Exchange) a gain may be had by overvaluing our moneys
beyond Seas, as now they be overvalued, especially in France; not only a
Merchant making contract as aforesaid, or a Traveller (not knowing the mystery)
shall lose ten or twenty in the hundred: And the Merchant (observer of the
mystery) will (for the gain had thereby) export the same in specie, but more
especially gold, when visibly without change of species, he may retain ten
or more of those pieces; and there with Ninety (or less) of those pieces, pay
the hundred pounds or pieces received here; and this is the overt or open
fallacy by mutation of place, now too frequently used, by the denomination of
that Coin.

But there is another more secret, which is practiced by exchangers, to be
considered from the finenesse of the Coin; wherein is to be noted that all
Princes Coins are not alike, for some have more Allay or Copper mixed with the
gold or silver, as before has bin touched; there being only two chief ways
of deceit; denomination, or open deceit; The second, intrinsecall or inward
finenesse, consisting in the mixture of Copper more or less.

And because our Gold might not be seen too visible, and make too great a show
in France; there is now an ordinance in France to bring the foreign Gold (so
fast as it comes into his Exchequer,) into the myn^ to be there minted into
French Crowns double and treble and quatreble pieces, calling them Lowyzens,
and minteth them after the proportion of fifteen to one of Silver, we holding
in our proportion thirteen to one; which very Mynt is able by that means to
draw all our gold away (even that which is left) so fast as it can be gleaned
up, if remedy be not provided speedily.

And occasion now offers it self to give us to understand this observation
following; that if disproportion between Gold and Silver be not observed
aright; gold may buy silver out of the Realm, and silver may buy gold out of
the Realm, and the Realm deprived of the one by the other; The raising of the
gold here, did cause more gold then silver to come to the Mynt; and by the same
means, it is called from us into France; which plainly shows that the
raising of Gold or Silver, or disproportioning one by another, is but
temporary, and in the end proves no better than a fallacy, as inhancing and
debasing, and they all be; And the truth is, no state stands sure that stands
not of the rules of right.

Here is to be noted that silver prizes gold, and gold prizes not silver; The
reason is, because silver is of more common use, though gold be more esteemed
of rich men, according to the common adage, bonum quo communius, eo melius, it
is also better for the kingdom, that more silver then gold be minted, for
silver is not so hastily nor easily exported, as gold will be: and there will
be always some Canker worms or money brokers to export silver or gold, so
long as trade is; for remedy of which there must be some allowance made in the
balance of Trade.

But something else comes to mind, that hinders me yet for speaking of the
balance a while, which is the inconveniences that befall this our state, when
our moneys are raised or made little; The moving of our mynt must either be in
imbasing the gold or silver, or advancing it in denomination, for back it
cannot be brought when once it is raised, and has obtained Currancy; It is a
dangerous thing to meddle with the Mynt, either in imbasing the money, or
cutting it smaller with the Sheares; for if it be embased, first, it causes
counterfeiting; secondly, that part, or so much as is embased, will carry so
much fine silver out of the Realm; and when it is perceived, the amends is as
evil as the disease. All those in whose hands the base money shall be, shall
be the loosers of so much as is minted within the Realm before it be
decryed, and what grievance would this be? able even to cause the Commonalty
hate the government, and fall into uproares, and unnatural rebellions, as it
has been in times past when the Commons rebelled and wrote these words in
their banner or Standard, Rex est qui been regit.

If the money be made less, it gives so much to the le^^ye or borrower; the
Kings revenue that stands upon constant fees of his Crown, ancient Crown
lands lease, all rent charges, land of the Bishops or Church, and such like
that be leased, shall loose so much; the Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Usurers
shall part with so much in proportion as the money is advanced, so commodities
will be advanced accordingly; So whether moneys be raised or debased, it makes
disturbance most miserable in effect.

Therefore there is no stirring of our mynt neither up nor down, for the
reasons aforesaid, no gain to the kingdom but infallable loss to some part,
heart burning and coffeehouse fit to bring in a foreign enemy will ensue,
the tampering with the Mynt.

Therefore I conclude this point, that there is no safe way, but to stand
constant at home, and change with the changer abroad, to keep our moneys at
home.

And first to prove the Merchant Exchange un-equally carried, is the efficient
cause of exporting our money, give me leave to know whether plenty of moneys
make our prices to rise, and scarcity of money make small prices, Which no man
(I think) will deny, and that commodities are prised according to the
goodness of the coin, or to what end serves fine gold and fine silver, if it
be not to prize all things?

And if in our commerce with other nations, we do give more fine Gold or Silver
then we receive, or undertake our Coins in commerce with others, It is a
sufficient outlet or way to carry out our money or bullion; when thereby those
that perceive the advantage to be had, shall leave the true use of trading in
Merchandise, and turn money Merchants, or exporters of bullion or monyes, for
no laws are prevalent against gain; And if we do not carry an even hand with
forrainers in preserving and increasing our moneys, as forrainers do, we shall
in small time undervalue our commodities for want of money, and consequently
overballance our Trade in price or quality, and continuing the same course,
send out our monyes in change for commodities, and have no more commodities
then we had before; which course will infallibly impoverish the Realm
exceedingly: when there is a want of money or wasting of bullion, the
commodities of the Realm Wool and woollen manufactors, will fall in price;
the commodities falling, rents will fall accordingly; when rents do fall by
such a necessity, the necessity which spreads its self over the land: And
(Tenants having taken leases) at inhanced prices, of Country commodities, not
knowing the efficient cause of this change, will lay the cause upon the
Landlords and grow in hatred toward them, not knowing how to hold their
farms, nor what to do if they give them over; this is a fearful effect that
follows the want of a covenient stock of money to maintain the price, and
to beat or maintain our home Commerce, proceeding from foreign cause, and
not from Land-owners or Tenants at home;

So it follows, that those that look to the homecause; as evil making of
our manifactures, or such like, do not amend the matter nor raise the prices,
so long as there is no more moneys to make the prices any greater; for it is
infallably true, much money much price; little money little price; and it is as
true that the inhancing of our Gold and Silver in France, will draw our money
into France, if remedy be not had; for the open reason aforesaid, namely, the
inhancing of Gold and Silver beyond the Sea, and specially in France, and this
is openly done to the view of all the world.

But there is a more secret way practiced by Merchants and Bankers, which has
long continued a secret biting or Canker-eating Usury, namely, the
marchandizing Exchange, which at the first was devised for a good and moderate
gain to the lender and ready dispatch in their affairs, and for avoiding of
hazard in postage of monyes, which being abused is turned into inestimable
loss and damage to the Prince and kingdom wherein it is not understood by the
Merchants in general that use it.

To avoid the carrying of moneys out of every Princes Realm, and that every
Prince might have the sole use of their own monys within their dominions, and
for the aforesaid causes, a certain exchange was devised; grounded upon the
weight and finenes of the moneys of each Country, just value for value, the
taker or borrower to give the lender usance for the time according to reason,
and so might our exchange of England (grounded upon the same reason) be
continued; and the Law of the land commands the same.

And thereupon the true valuation of our money makes the price of exchange, for
every place wheresoever we have to do; and the want of knowing and putting
into use this mystery of comparing our Coins, with the Coins of others,
value, for value; brings in the abuse, and an inestimable damage to this
kingdom; for we ought to examine and compare our weight aforesaid with the
weight of other Countries; and the finenesse of our Standard aforesaid, with
the finenesse of the STANDARD of the moneys of other Countries; And if we
differ not with them in the proportion between the Gold and Silver, then may
our Exchange run at one price both for the Gold and Silver, the valuation of
each Countries moneys being taken according to weight and finenesse as
aforesaid.

And if the proportion of Gold and Silver of other monyes do differ from ours,
then must we have two distinct valuations, one for the Gold, the other for the
Silver, as now there is difference in proportion in France, from ours in
England; And hereby shall we find how much fine silver or gold our pound
Starling contains, and how much of other moneys of Germany, France, the low
Countries, the East Countries, or elsewhere, we are to have to countervaile
the same in the like weight and finenesse answerable to ours, whether it be by
the Pound, Crown, Ducket, or Doller, giving always value for value, which
amongst Merchants was and is called Parre.

This due and equitable course in Exchange being abused, and through the
ignorance of Merchants of not examining the truth, but taking the price of
Exchange upon Trust, from the Bankers who rule the price of Exchange, this
trade of Exchange is become very deceiveable and damageable to our kingdom;
the Merchant making his account from the price of exchange, as it goes when he
uses it, and not from the true parre or equality required; And from hence
grows the loss of our moneys, and the Exchange is become predominant over
our moneys, as moneys do rule commodities; and is the very efficient cause of
this over ballancing of commodities in price before spoken of, and consequently
of the decrease of our wealth, and exportation of our moneys, when we are
driven thereby to give as much of our native commodities for foreign
commodities as we did before the abuse, and moneys to boot to fulfill the same
quantity.

This exchange is made properly by bills, when money is delivered simply here
in England, and bills delivered or received again for the payment thereof in
some other Country beyond Sea, or when the like is done beyond the Seas, and
money received here in England; And that upon a certain price agreed upon
between party and party, which is termed the price of Exchange, whereof the
merchants, or rather the Bankers have the only and whole disposing, and buy
and sell their commodities beyond the Seas accordingly, without that few or
none of them do look into the nature or inward value of the Exchange, but
only to the prefent object, which is to know how the price thereof goes at
the time when they have occasion to deal there with either in taking up or
delivering out monyes by Exchange; whereas, if they will be true Exchangers
indeed, they must know perfectly the weight and fitness of every Countries
coin, hereby to render every one his just and due proportion as aforesaid; and
this is, par pari refer, with consideration to the lender according to the
time agreed upon.

And because I have heretofore attributed the ruling of the Exchange to the
Bankers, rather then to the general or common Merchants; It behooveth me (for
the enlightening of Your understanding, and illustration of the business of
Exchange, to show what a Banker is. A bank is properly a collection of a great
quantity of the ready monyes of a Province, Common weal or City, into the
hands of some persons, licensed and established thereunto by public authority,
erected with great solemnity in the view of all the people and inhabitants,
showing great store of Gold and Silver, as belonging to the persons so
established, which is to them an attractive to persuade and allure the common
people to bring their monyes into these Bankers hands; So that these persons or
Bankers, do become (as it were) the general servants or Cassiers of that City,
province, or common weal;

The Bankers have their factors or correspondency in the chief places in
Christendom, and do keep account with every man of whom they have received
any money into their Bank. And generally all men of wealth that be merchants,
are desirous to please them, and to bring their moneys into the Bank, in
regard of double and treble credit they give to their compartners, which they
do by assignation without laying any out of the bank.

Such and greater devises have they and many other too long now to recite; the
money (still remaining in the Bankers hands) is employed by them to other uses;
as to the engrossing of foreign commodities, to Englands prejudice, and such
like feats, making moneys to ebb and flow at their pleasure, when they please;
And to that purpose, the heads of every bank do set price and agree upon it
by common consent at their Ferias or general fair for moneys only: And still
their eye or devises tend to the beating down of our English, and raising
their native commodities; which cunning our Merchants do not countermand, as
in old times, when the Staplers that were entrusted with our staple
commodities, were sworn to advance our kingdoms commodities to their power;
as also to bring into the Realm, a fifth part of their exitus in money.

But as concerning the point of Exchange, it is most certain that neither
difference of weight, finenesse of Standard, nor valuation of money can be any
true cause of exporting of our moneys, so long as a due course is holden in
Exchange; But this due course being abused, causes (as aforesaid) our moneys
to be exported, and makes scarcity thereof, which abateth the price of our
home commodities, and (on the contrary side) advances the price of the
foreign commodities, by reason of plenty of money there, increased by ours,
sent thither.

But to this, may be objected; If this be true, as it is very likely, then it
would follow that our commodities would also be dear where the plenty of money
is; True it is, it would be so, but that they have two crafty devises to
prevent the rising of our commodities; one is, our Merchants being takers of
moneys here to pay there, they know they must sell, and do profer the price
according to the goods in bought, which they know as well as they that bought
them; And also they have Toleration of their moneys to pass far above their
value with them, and to the greater transportation of ours, and hinderance of
importation of any to us.

Therefore, to conclude; There is no remedy but in the watch of the Exchange,
to preserve our own at home, and our ample trade of woollen commodities will
advance the balance.

An high Exchange hinders moneys to come from the East, diverts the Rialls of
eight that come from the West, and hinders employment at home.

A low Exchange exporteth our money in specie, for gain; wherefore neither
high, nor low Exchange is advantageous, but prejudicial to us, only now a
medium is the best; giving leave to plenty or scarcity, as necessity or plenty
inviteth, and most agreeable to right and equity to all men; which otherwise
carried, they have three ways of exportation; namely, by commodities, monyes,
and exchange; But there are but two ways of importation; namely, commodities,
and Exchange, whereby comes a notable over-ballancing of foreign
commodities; and be assured, the gains to be sought upon moneys, does
impeach the gains to be had upon our commodities, and beats down our
prices at home, and our commodities being beat down, it is a great cause of
carrying out our moneys to fulfill, or equal the balance.

The moneys exported (as they now be) causes a plenty of moneys beyond Sea,
so that our Merchants buying dear, must sell dear; which brings a
wonderful overballancing, and causes us to feed upon our native soil, giving
the benefit thereof to another nation; whereas we should live by the gains of
our home commodities, being fold to other Nations: and now we are driven to
seek a gain upon foreign commodities, to the great prejudice of our own
Country, wherein, though the Merchants be gainers, yet the king dome generally
bears the loss, and they feed still upon their Mothers belly; whereunto they
are the more instigated through the immoderate use of foreign commodities,
which does not fall out altogether in the quantity, but more in price; the
forraigner growing daily in price, and increasing upon us (within this fifty
years) a fourth part, more than we have increased our moneys still being with
us the self same, and herein consists the over ballancing aforesaid; for if
the foreign commodities, which are soon consumed, and brought (as it were)
to dung, shall amount in value, or cost as much or more, than the solid
commodities of our land; certes that land is very negligent and unprofitable in
every man's judgment.

So then give me leave to intimate this following, that follows by the abuse
or want of observing the true use thereof; That our home commodities are abated
by the abuse of the Exchange four manner of ways.

First, by scarcity of money (which causes home commodities to be good
cheap) caused by the unequal exchange.

Secondly, by the gain sought upon moneys which otherwise would be sought
upon our commodities.

Thirdly, by an high Exchange with us, which causes men to deliver that money
by Exchange, in nature of Trade, which otherwise, by them might be employed
upon our commodities; likewise by a low Exchange which causes exportation of
our moneys.

Fourthly, by rash sale of our commodities by young Merchants, and others, that
are driven to pay money taken up by exchange here in England, to keep them
doing, thereby spoiling the market of others.

Foreign commodities (on the contrary) are advanced four manner of ways.

First, through plenty of moneys in other Countries, which makes generally
things dear; which plenty is increased by our own moneys, transported to our
own hurt every way.

Secondly, by a high Exchange beyond the Seas, whereby men are inclined to buy
foreign commodities, and by a low Exchange, when there are no takers up of
money, and therein our excessive use of them, does encourage them.

Thirdly, by the tolleration of moneys beyond Seas, to go current far above
their value; for by the alteration of moneys, the price of commodities does
alter also; And this tolleration being an hinderance, for the importation of
monyes, causes the greater quantity of foreign commodities to be brought
over at a dearer rate.

Fourthly, for that the principal commodities of Silks, Velvets, Fustians,
and such like, are engrossed by the bankers as aforesaid, that sell them at
their pleasure. These both ways considered, must needs bring an over balance
in our trade, in value to the loss of 500000 a year, at least.

Thus we may consider how the Bankers, and every one of our felves do use or
rather abuse the Exchange, making it a trade for moneys; and makes that a
biting usury, which was invented for speedy commutation, ease, safety, and
moderate gain to the lender, and Merchant borrower indifferently.

Thus you see, Marchandizing Exchange rules moneys, as moneys rules
commodities; and that is fully proved when we shall find visibly that one sum
of money of one sort and kind of Coin, has two prices, and two valuations at
one time, exchanging the place only, or Country, as for example.

You have a piece of twenty shillings, and beyond the Seas you may see the same
species pass between man and man in some place for 22s in some other place at
24s, and in France at 26s, at one and the self same time, and money willingly
goes where it is most made on, and whether they work upon coined money, or
valuing the ounce or pound at an higher price or rate, then their neighbor
Princes; If it be not carefully looked unto, it works the same effect, and
one remedy preventeth both.

Wherefore (seeing our Merchants have no care nor regard of this) it behooveth
our State (which you represent at this present) to have a special regard and
care unto, which I most humbly present to your grave consideration; least the
want of moneys (when you stand most need of it) now flying away from us do
still continue the fall of Woolls, yet lower, with all other commodities, and
your Rents and livelihood to fall, which will be the undoing of your Tenants
(turning up your farms) impoverishing all trades, and handy crafts, in the
whole kingdom exceedingly in general, which (in truth) is the mother of
Rebellion, procured through a general decay of all estates, every man being
ready to strike the next above him or about him; And these be the fearful
effects that follow an unequal Exchange, and (for truth) the cunning course
thereof unknown to most Merchants, and almost all men else, excepting some few
that use it for their private and unconscionable gain, to the kingdoms loss;
like unto the Canker or disease called a Wolf, eating and consuming the bosom
that first bred it.

Give me leave (before I explain the conceived remedy) to inform you, that
if any (to delude time) will oppose or contradict, that an unequal exchange is
prejudicial to our State; it is yielded unto by common assent of all hands,
Merchants and others, that an unequal Exchange is prejudicial to the State,
when is was controverted and determined in King James his time; at what time he
appointed certain Commissioners for trade, to sit weekly in
Haberdashers-HALL. Whereupon it follows, that for the prevention of public
loss to the kingdom, a party or equality of Exchange should be made known
to all men that have occasion to use Exchange; having regard to the
forbearance, according to time and place; which is most just and equal for all
men, both denizens and strangers.

To this exception will be taken, unless I do explain my self, allowing and
granting for truth that plenty or scarcity of moneys to be given or taken up,
does bear a sway, even as it is upon the statute made upon usury.

If there be plenty of moneys, they will be lent under the Statute; and if
there be scarcity, there will be more given for the Loan then the statute
allows, by some covert means or other, for (in ttuth) the good use of
marchandizing Exchange, is none other but a ready way of borrowing for
merchants, without sureties, or delay to be executed; which moderately used,
(without excessive, or biting Usury) is both profitable and commendable for all
merchants to use, as their occasion requires. But if it be unequally and
abusedly carried, may be justly called, the Canker of Englands common wealth.

And let no merchant think but that I am their friend in wishing them ease and
remedy herein, that it be not carried at the will of the Banker, as it is; but
that it may be used according to the ancient Laws of the Kingdom extant for
the same. And the practice of the time of Queen Elizabeth and her proclamation
to that purpose; which Laws and proclamation will appear upon the debate of
this business, if you please to take order therein.

As also the demonstration of the tables mentioned in the Law, one for Gold,
and another for Silver; as I have seen the like made in King Edward the Sixth
his time, respectively expressing the value of every piece of Gold or silver
coin, with whom we have commerce, severally compared with our pound starling,
whereby the equality is demonstrated to every Merchant that will follow the
table of Exchange, to avoid the danger of the Law.

And because foreign Coins are daily subject to alteration in finenesse or
valuation, after the computation is once made; It behooves that there be (and
it is no hard matter) an observant watch, or diligent eye set over those places
of commerce and Mints, to send intelligence hither to the Guardian of the
Tables, to alter the table immediately in that point, and to keep constant at
home; which will be a sufficient guide to defend us from foreign wrong by
any. This Table of demonstration once made, will be far more easy to
understand, then any pen or tongue can express.

This being done and observed, that the foreign Banker or exchanger do us no
harm; in a small process of time, our Balance of Trade will recover it self
again; and we shall have (God willing) a constant thrift to attend our
Kingdoms labors, and not be wrought upon by any biting usury by Shufts or
intervall of time, to wast, or exhaust our treasure, or consume our kingdoms
stock, that should maintain the price of our kingdoms commodities, rents,
and artizens, as sundry times (in my memory) it has done; but what a kingdom
or kingdoms exitus, have we, that is able to bear the loss of so much Coin
as we have lost this three or four years, which amounts near to two
millions of Gold, and undoubtedly our Silver will follow after, (and begins
visibly to go already) if remedy be not had; to the unspeakeable loss of all
the kingdom, as before has been declared.

These tables of Exchange being put in use for our safeguard; it follows then
(as good husbands use to do) that we take account of our kingdoms thrift, to
see yearly how we thrive, also to know by what ways we go about it, and
therein to distinguish what several Trade is beneficial to our kingdom, or
not; and to set redress accordingly (if occasion require it;) which is no new
thing, but an ancient practice, as might be manifested; To begin with that in
general, which must be Examined in every particular trade.

First then, that trade or Merchant that carries out our superfluities, or
those commodities we abound in, and brings in those commodities that we
want, for them; is a good trade, or Merchant, and deserves to be nourished,
countenanced, and maintained therein, and those that do the contrary, better
ordered.

Now, who knows not that we abound in Wool, and woollen commodities, Tynne
and lead, and some other things, which I name not? Who knows not, what we
want of our own, but must have it from without us; namely, gold, silver, Iron,
and steel, which for brevity I name not; per consequence it follows, that
those Merchants that bring in those said commodities we want, are most to be
nourished and favored before others that do the contrary.

But how, or by what means is this trade, or Merchant discovered, but by the
ancient way of balance of trade, of late years almost grown out of use; but
that it was discovered in the latter time of King James, and always observed
by the wise Lord Burley, Lord Treasurer of England. And to what other end was
all the port books of the kingdom brought into the Custom house of London;
and from thence once a year transmitted into the Kings remembrancers office in
the Exchequer; where one gross sum of our kingdoms exitus and introitus might
be known, of all the goods both inward and outward bound, and the value of
both accounted; thereby to know whether we were buyers or sellers; for it
behooveth a father of a family to be a seller, and not a buyer; And if it be
found that we sell more than we buy, we do well; if otherwise, it behooveth us
to look about us.

As in the general a view may be had of our public Thrift; so in every
particular Trade, their walk being observed, it may be known what trade
brings in or forces in money, or such things as we want, for therein lies a
difference to be observed, and thereupon lies our kingdoms thrift. As also
may be found what Trade is hurtful or damageable; This public Thrift or
reformation (as I conceive) would not be held in a mystery, but be made more
common and easy to every intelligent Gentleman, because he is in some sort
interessed in the same, for the advancement of the public good, and therein,
his own particular also.

Therefore I am bold, and humbly commend the general, or theoricall studies of
the Marchandizing Exchange, and balance of Trade, unto your wisdom to be
regarded; and for these purposes, the keeping and the observance of the
balance of trade is useful.

There be also many other things to be met with in the observation of the
Merchant Exchange, and balance of trade, which I forbear to particularize for
avoiding of tediousness and dispute that may arise by them that would
endeavor to frustrate the business; for private gain never wants colors,
and pretexts, to stupisie or inveigle the understanding of such as have not
been versed herein.

Give me leave (lastly) to repeat one thing wice, though the same have in
effect been said before.

It is a sure Tenet or maxim, that it is necessary for our kingdom to keep
constancy in our Mynt at home; So is it as necessary to change with the changer
in all foreign Coins, either Gold or Silver, reducing all foreign Coins
to a par or equality, with our constant coins; and to that end, in ancient
times there was a pair of Tables set forth, expressing the same
demonstratively; The French Crown to answer to fix of our English shillings;
Our unite, to contain three French Crowns, and a third; and so of the Dutch
Rider; although it go but for one and twenty shillings, it is of equal value
to our unite; So all foreign coins severally reduced to our coins, did show
and express, what was to be given and allowed, between strangers and us, in
accounts; which is called the Merchandise Exchange.

This equality being known and expressed, as aforesaid, we may be deceived
three manner of ways;

First, (if we watch not foreign mints) by the sheares in coining, whereby
it may come to want in weight, though it were of equal finenesse.

Secondly, by putting in more Allay or Copper into their moneys, which is not
perceived or discovered, but by Trial in the fire, in melting some part, and
refyning it, and comparing the remainder of pure silver, to the like quantity
of our money refined as theirs was.

The third is without lessening or imbasing, to call any of their species
higher up; a way commonly used in foreign parts, called denomination, which
must be watched and prevented by new expressions, as is aforesaid, (so often as
there shall be cause) by such as the King shall depute for that purpose; most
proper to the Mint master, or other skillful in mint causes; This is a sure way
of preserving our Coins at home; without which the Bankers (both foreign and
domestic) have power to deceive our kingdom, and lessen our kingdoms stock
of Gold and Silver, which will turn to a fearful effect in time, and in few
words not to be expressed, and most of all, when this balance of trade is
against us to our loss; and that Country that gains the balance, gets our
money, be it friend or enemy; And if we loose in the total balance of our
trade; how should we long subsist without home-poverty and consumption; and in
the well governing of the Merchant Exchange, and balance of Trade, consists
our weal or woe, concerning Thrift or wasting poverty.

FINIS.
Imprimatur.
