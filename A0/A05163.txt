God save the Queen.

An advertisement and defense for Truth against her Backbiters, and specially
against the whispering Favorers, and Colourers of Campions, and the rest of
his confederats treasons.
ALthough, at the late arraignments at Westminster of Edmonde Campion, and
other his accomplices condemned there of sundry high treasons, it was manifestly
declared and fully proved, how they all, under prctence of the names of
Jesuits, Seminary Priests, and other persons of like condition, had secretly
come into this Realm by the sending of sundry persons authorized by the Pope,
to move the people by their secret persuasions to change their professions in
the matter of Religion, of long time quietly established in this Realm, and to
be reconciled to the obedience of the Pope, and withdrawn from their natural
allegiance due to the Queens Majesty, and by these means to be ready in
their hearts and minds and otherwise provided, to join their forces as well
with such as their Heads and superiors which sent them, intended speedily to
procure to be sent into this Realm, as with other rebellious Subjects by them
to be thereto also excited, of purpose to deprive her Majesty of her life,
crown and dignity, in like manner as lately has been notoriously attempted
and put in execution by D. Sanders an errant and detestable Traitor, and
whilst he lived one of the said Campions companions, and by other English
and Irish Jesuits and Traitors in Ireland, where they had first by their like
secret means and persuasions, entised a great multitude of people of that
Land, first to change their profession of Religion and to acknowledge the Popes
authority, and to renounce the just authority of her Majesty, and so
departing from their allegiance upon the arrival of foreign forces they did
enter into a manifest Rebellion, against the which Almighty God the just
auenger of Rebels, by his goodness has given her Majesty (through her good
ministers) power to the vanquishing not only of those foreign forces, but
also of a great number of the Rebels there: Yet it is maliciously, falsely, and
traitorously by some of the secret favorers of the said Campion, and other the
said condemned Traitors, whispered in corners, that the offenses of these
traitors, were but for their secret attemptings as Jesuits by exhorting and
teaching, with Shriuing, Massing, and such like acts, to move people to change
their Religion, and to yield their obedience to the Pope as Christ's vicar
(although the same are of themselves offenses very vainous, and seeds of
sedicion not allowable by the Laws of the Realm) whereas in very truth
nevertheless it did manifestly appear upon their Juditements and at their
arraignements by sundry confessions of some of their own companions, and by
many good proofs and witnesses produced and sworn before their faces, that
their factes, whereof they were arraigned and condemned, were such as were in
truth high Treasons committed against her Majesty's most Royal person, and
against the ancient Laws and Statutes of this Realm, which many hundred
years past were in force against like Traitors, and not for factes of
doctrine or Religion, nor yet for offenses against any late or new Statutes,
the same being many conspiracies at sundry times beyond the Seas, at Rome in
Italy, and other places, and lastly at Rheims in France, where there are
nourished by the Popes authority in Seminaries, multitudes of English
Jesuits, Seminary Priests, and Fugitives, whereof their Heads and Governors
use continually in their Sermons and in their Books publicly printed, as
Traitors to declare their traitorous minds, as farrefoorth as they can, to
the deprivation of the Queens Majesty of her life and crown, to which ends
the said Campion and his said Companions, by procurement of their ssaid Heads,
came secretly into this Realm to move the Subjects to renounce their natural
obedience, and according to a Bull of the last Pope Pius published, to persuade
all sorts with whom they durst secretly deal, that her Majesty, by the said
Popes excommunication, was not the lawful Queen of the Realm, nor that the
Subjects were bound to obey any of her laws or Ministers, but that they were
all free and discharged of their obedience and allegiance, and that they might
lawfully, yea that when time might serve, they ought to take arms against her
Majesty, as in the late rebellion in ye North was manifestly by like means
put in execution, and as now also lately was notoriously attempted in Ireland,
by stirring up the people in the Popes name, and under his standerd to an open
general rebellion, and to have brought these things to pass in this Realm,
was the coming into this Realm of the said Campion and his Accomplices most
manifestly tried and proved, as if by Gods goodness by their apprehensions
after their secret wanderings and disguisings of them selves in a great part of
the Shires of the Realm these Traitors had not been now stayed, and by just
punishments ordered to be executed, there would have appeared such mischief as
is lamentable to be thought of, to ye danger of her Majesty's person, and to
the hazard and ruin of the whole Realm, by invasion of the same with foreign
enemies, and by raising of inward war within the Realm, the end and event
whereof, as of all war civil, can not be without great grief mentioned or
imagined.

And to ye further reproof and condemnation of the said Campion and other the
Traitors now condemned, they being all severally and earnestly required at ye
place of their arraignement to declare what they thought of the said Popes
Bull (by which her Majesty was in the Popes intention deprived of the Crown)
and of Doctor Sanders, and of Bristowes traitorous writings in maintenance of
the said Bull, and allowance of the Rebellion in the North, and of Saunders
traiterous actions in Irelande, and being likewise demanded what they did
think if the present Pope should publish the like Bull, none of them all, but
one only named Rushton, could be persuaded by any their answers to show in
any part their mislykings either of the former Bull, or of D. Sanders, or
Bristowes traitorous writings or actions, or of the Pope that now is, if he
should now publish the like Bull against her Majesty, so as they did
apparently show their traitorous hearts still fixed to persist in their deuilish
minds against their natural allegiance: Whereof God give all good Subjects
being true Englishmen borne, grace to beware, and in no sort to give ear or
succor to such pernicious Traitors, howsoever they shall be covered with
hypocrisy, and false and fained holiness of Rome.

God save the Queen, long to reign to his honor.
