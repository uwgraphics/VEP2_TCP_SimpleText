Reader, read ere thou judge: so may thou see
The Popedomes sleightes and fruit of tyranny.
THRICE Illustrious, reverend, generous, magnificent and noble Lords, our
approved good friends and woorthily respected neighbors, with our heartiest
salutation we here offer you all our service.
ALl the world knows that these broils of war and commotions in
government have not without just occasion been stirred up, and that our
enterprise in betaking us to our arms, neither did nor does aim at the
offense of any man: but was only intended for the standing upon our own
guard, and the repelling of so many and so grievous injuries which heretofore
we have been subject unto. Nevertheless fearing least our silence might be a
prejudice unto us and brande us with some blame because of the weale-publike of
Christendom, we thought it convenient, to acquaint you in few terms with the
first motives of these tumults, that (occasion offering it self) you might the
rather excuse and justify our proceedings both to your neighbor Christian
Princes, as also to all others of the foresaid Christian commonweal.

You shall understand then that his sacred Imperial and royal Majesty having
infringed the oath wherein he was bound and obliged unto this realm, having
violated and disanuld all the rights, immunities, liberties and privileges
which for so many especial merits and rare virtues had of a long time been
conferd upon our predecessors by the holy kings of Hungary: has
notwithstanding without either regard of our bodies, our goods, or respect of
justice, nobility or religion, as it were abandoned and prostituted us to the
merciless mercy of his men of war, our bodies for the exercising of their
cruelties, and our spoils for the enriching of their bags: himself lending a
deaf ear to our so pitiful and so many supplications formed and presented
unto him within these 20 years at his Diets and general assemblies in
Possonia: as also he lightly passed over those relations and remonstrances
offered unto him by Ambassadors sent up by the Estates of the realm for the
same purpose. True it is that certain years past his foresaid Majesty sent
to our succor one George Basta accompanied with an army of sundry nations,
and amongst them no few Wallons: but he was so far from employing his force
in our defense, that he granted his soldiers absolute commission to put land
and country to fire and sword; as also to raunsacke, beat down and level
with the ground the new-pilled and lately robbed houses of the Noblemen. And
although he had sufficiently provided for the most of his guard and such as
were nighest about him, yet was there no consideration nor respect had at all:
for the Wallons for all this ceased not to surprise, sack and ruinate whole
Towns, Villages, Burrowes and Noblemens castles, whom they massacred without
respect, as they did also the Ministers of the word of God, fleaing some of
them as yet alive. They likewise seconded their cruelty with all filthiness and
infamous beastliness, raping and forcing women even to death: and without all
manner of regard of either youth or age, they spared neither yongue gyrles nor
(which is more) women now ready to be brought to bed, nay nor those which
now they found in travail, who^ they forced and ravished with a far more than
beastly cruelty. Moreover against all right and justice yawning and gaping for
our goods and possessions, he took counsel of his familiars and best-trusted
friends, of many sleights and tricks of legerdemaine, whereby he might either
snatch and extort, or at leastwise confiscate whatsoever we had. All which
inventions and mischievous practices he wrought by the means of his German
captains, whose service he likewise used in the tormenting of our persons, and
especially of theirs of the Nobility, who poor souls took no rest: for he
casting them into prison for all the torments they endured was never used to
release them, before such times as they bought their liberties full dearly.
And his custom was by the same means for the releasing of their imprisonment
to take of them a great and solemn oath that they would never bethink them of
that excessive wrong they had endured, nor ever by justice, laws or any other
way go about to recover some satisfaction, as likewise they should never
meddle with the recovering of such heritages and reuenews which had been taken
from them and bestowed upon strangers. And which is more, his imperial Majesty
for the space of thirteen years, during which our wars lasted, never deigned
as much as once to honor our Realm with his presence: that after so many
mischiefs he might bestow as it were a breathing space upon so many of his
faithful and poor distressed subjects: who in all their general Parliaments,
renewed every year and very chargeable unto them, had put up unto his Majesty
so many and so earnest petitions and supplications: insomuch as many private
men upon their own costs were feign to make a voyage unto Pragues and there to
cast themselves into his Majesty's arms, beseeching his mercy and craving
justice: but their cries were little regarded, only they were sent to certain
Counselors, who after a formal kind of justice dispatched them in the manner
of an D'uneacquit.
acquiting: so as the most part was feign to return without ought doing, with
strange outcries and complaints for want of justice. His Majesty himself
altogether as often as pleased him, directly against the customs and statutes of
the Realm, caused his judgments to be done and put in execution out of the
limits of the foresaid Realm: to whom who so resisted (howbeit such powers had
been referred to common assemblies or parliaments) was presently punished.
Witnesses be the most honorable Lords, Steeuen Illyeszarye, now banished and
bereaft of all his reuenews upon this occasion: and John Leo, a most honorable
man and a great Iusticier, with their Counselors, Diazy, Bamfy, Sigismunde,
Sarmasagly, Ladistas, Gyolafy, John Imrify, George and Valentine Homelay, as
also the famous George Sabo, who, how they have been dealt withal, all men
know. And making no account or esteem of a natural Hungarian, he invested
strangers with all the offices and estates of the Realm: which is nothing else
but to abastardise and violate the law and liberty of the Realm, a thing most
violent and never put in practice in any country. Lastly, to be brief, our
wives, our children, our brethren, our sisters, our parents and allies and what
else we possessed, lay at their command, and they disposed of it according to
their good will and pleasure. Now with what hart-pearcing grief we endured
all these crosses, we refer to the judgment of those who stripped of all
affections be plain lovers of public honesty and zealous of the law of God.
Yet have we endured all these things with such and so great patience as al our
neighbor Realms held us in admiration: and for all this never enterprised any
thing till we perceived how they of the Clergy against all right and reason
and the ordinances of the Realm, not content with their own limits, wrigold
themselves unto estates and offices, to the great disparagement of the laity,
and snatching the authority of Justice, withdrew to themselves all honors and
dignities: wherewith not satisfied they further pried how to deprive us of our
liberty, and which is worse, have adventured to tempt our Religion, employing
for that purpose diverse persons to quash and quench in us our Orthodoxall and
true confession of faith. Now the Ecclesiastical livings which anciently were
by his Majesty's Father and Grandfather, as also by the Generals of their
armies and principal Chiefetaynes of war, bestowed for the relief of our
public necessities and the maintaining and managing of a continual war,
and thereupon became impledgde and morgagde to our predecessors: are now
become the pray and the booty of Churchmen. Who, by unlawful means, usurp
and snatch them from the true owners and with their proceedings in
Ecclesiastical courts, being both Judges and parties, do infinitely molest
both the Nobility and the common people also, blind-fowlding and enueloping
them with the punishment of excommunication; the only means of absolution
from the which, is to resort fraught with fat and honorable presents, which
in the end brings them to a most miserable poverty.

Moreover in this last Diet, they of the realm having presented certain
articles to Sai serenite, meaning the Archduke.
his Highness (who was there present with all the power and puissance of his
Majesty as representing his person) and his Highness accepting of them, they
of the Church notwithstanding in a manifest disdain both of his Highness and
the rest of the Princes, adding, paring, changing and blotting out many points
contained in that bil of request, did maime and corrupt it altogether.

Furthermore the Wallons set on by some of the Bishops and suffering themselves
to be carried away with their own passions, having, in a manner never heard of
before, tormented the Ministers of the word of God, in the end massacred them
most bloudily: and passing further, fleshing themselves upon their dead and now
interred carcasses: unburied and burnt them starke-naked. And amongst many more,
they spared not the dead bodies of the noble and illustrious Lord George, Earl
of Bathor, his wife and his parents: and it is incredible how inhumanely they
used the dead body of that honorable Count Stephen Bathor. The arms of the
Earl George Bathor found within his tomb are at this instant in the
possession of the above named George Basta, and borne by him. In the end
setting forward to pull down the temple of Cassouia, to banish and chase out
all the Ministers and professors of true religion to seize violently upon all
the goods of the said town, and all this against the advice of John Jacob
Barbian, Earl of Belioyense and Governor of high Hungary: as also of Francis
Torgat, Chancellor and Bishop of Niter. When we saw these stratagems: we, in
the name of all the Realm, met together at the general assembly holden at
Possonia, and there wrought all our endeavors by prayers and supplications unto
his Highness, that he would hinder that resolution and ward of that blow,
humbly beseeching his Serenitie that for the conservation of peace, these
affairs of Religion might be passed over and deferd until some other time:
but for all that we did our utmost deuoir, yet could we obtain nothing at all,
and thereupon at the very same instance we made our complaints with
protestations in the presence of his foresaid Serenite.
Highness and the Estates of the Realm. But in steed of a good and courteous
answer which we promised our selves, his Majesty quite contrary of his own
proper disposition never acquainting the Estates withal: and in mere
misprision of their authority (a thing never heretofore practiced by any King
of Hungary) dared boldly of his absolute power to insert a most pernicious and
horrible Article among the rest which menaced and threatened no less unto us,
than the utter loss and confusion of our substance, our possessions, our
lives, yea and our very souls, with the quite abolishing and rooting out of
all the Hungarian nation. And by this time for an earnest penny and a sure
testimony of his good will, he had already by his most rigorous briefes,
proceeded in the banishing of the Archbishop of Coloarense, that by this means
he might with the greater facility make himself master of the Temple, the
Parish and the University of Lutchenien. Now to delay and allay the current of
so many mischiefs, setting before our eyes all such things as had passed as
also those flames which more began to work our utter ruin and confusion: by
authority of our common assembly called for this purpose in the town of Galred
in the presence of the foresaid Earl of Belioyense and of them of the chamber
of Sepuse, and he himself of whom we spak assisting: we solemnly swore to
persist constantly in that protestation which we had so authentically made in
the Diet of Possonia: and that we would maintain and defend our selves by
those decrees of Andrew, the second, called King of Jerusalem, which he enacted
in the year 12.22. Art. 31. and they be of this substance. Now if either we or
any one of our successors in any time whatsoever, go against this our
pleasure, we license our subjects and give them all power to contradict and
resist us, so as afterward they may never be branded with any note of treason
or infamy for the same.

And in the first Epistle, the ninth Tit. of that Tripartite work of the laws
of Hungary, he says expressly: Let this be the fourth and absolute liberty, if
any of the Kings or Princes happen to derogate from the freedom of the Noble
men etc.

As it follows in the decrees of the foresaid most excellent Prince Andrew
the second entitled King of Jerusalem: and for the more strict observation
thereof, every true King of Hungary, before his coronation is bound and
accustomed to swear the observance of the same conditions: to wit, To permit
and consent that men rise up in arms against him without any note of treason,
in such cases: as when he goes in any thing about to restrain from them their
liberty. But in the Articles of the Diet held at Possonia, 1604. about the end
there is one last of all which has been unlawfully and forcibly added and
couched in, and it goes thus:

Lastly, his sacred Imperial and royal Majesty having understood not without
great displeasure as well by reports worthy of credit, as by two requests by
which the forenamed high prince Mathias Archduke of Austria, his most dear
brother, besought him to take part with them, who termed themselves the better
and sounder part of the estate and order of the Realm of Hungary (of the which
unusual and uncouth kind of speech he much marueiled, as also for their
complaints of troubling their exercises of Religion, wasting their Churches and
revenues in expenses, and chasing away of their Ministers and preachers: of
the which they had heretofore complained to his Highness, both by writing and
word of mouth, as also by ample declarations, and also besought him to be a
mediator unto his Majesty for the restitution of such things as had been
violently taken from them, that so they might hereafter live freely in the
profession of their religion, who notwithstanding solicited by his Highness to
declare more especially, and to specify at large the subject of their writing,
and the authors of the same, could never be brought to say any thing, nor to
give any further declaration either of the profession of their religion, or of
what Churches, what revenues had been taken away from them, of the which they
only complained in general terms, not discending to any particulars) and
that continuing in their male-contentednes, it was impossible to alter this
their opinion: such discord I say, being of no small power to slacken and
weaken the effects of al treatises in the Parliament, besides that it is a
great scandal and an ill example to other States of the realm, could not but
much aggreeue his Highness and his sacred Majesty: who, all astonished cannot
call to mind what injuries or what fasheries they pretend to have received in
matters of religion, nor what Churches, what revenues, especially hereditary
or ancient, could be taken from them. His foresaid Majesty is likewise in doubt
and can hardly be resolved seeing their tumultuous pretenses, which make him
think, nay half persuade him, that by the means of their religion they have
practiced some intelligence with the free cities of the realm, which be the
proper demaines of his imperial Majesty as well known King of Hungary. Now
even as his sacred imperial and royal Majesty in imitation of so many holy
Roman Emperors and Kings of Hungary his ancestors and predecessors,
unfeignedly embraces with ardent zeal the Catholic Roman religion, so in
like manner he purposes and desires above all things, when he has purified
and cleansed it of all false opinions and newfound doctrines, to make it to the
glory and praise of the Almighty God, increase and flourish in all his realms
and provinces: but especially in this realm of Hungary to maintain and defend
it with all his power, as by the bond of his own vocation he finds himself
obliged. Hereupon his facred imperial Majesty of his own proper motion and
of his royal and absolute power does confirm all those ordinances, statutes
and decrees which heretofore have been addressed for the advancement of the
aforesaid Catholic and Roman faith, as well by King Stephen, the Apostle of
the Hungarian nation, as by other devout kings of Hungary his predecessors:
all which constitutions he fully ratifies by this present Article, as if they
had been word by word here specified. And to the end that hereafter in
general Assemblies and Diets where are handled matters of great importance and
consequence concerning realms, no man shall dare presume upon any incident
colored pretext to insert any point or affairs of religion which might
slacken the foresaid public affairs: his sacred Majesty wills and commands
that upon most rigorous pains such a one escape not unpunished: but that
immediately men proceed against him and all such semblable brablers, lovers
and embracers of novelties: and that without any remission or pardon they be
severely chastised and punished, following the decrees enacted against such by
our predecessors, the Kings of Hungary, so that others by their correction may
learn and take example.

But leave we these things as others, which to endure longer is impossible,
judging by the former that there remains no speedier means to rid us of
this insupportable yoke, than the taking of arms, which we will employ upon
such as practicing against our religion and liberty, endeavor to root out the
Hungarian nation. Now to the end men should not take us for Apostates from the
Christian faith, or believe that we of set purpose bandied or employed our
forces against any that professed Christianity, we thought it good to give your
thrice illustrious, respect worthy, Generous, Magnificent, and noble
Lordships, our good and ancient neighbors a taste of our intention and of the
cause of our commotions: to the end you might understand that neither pride,
nor ambition, nor hatred conceived against any Christian prince moved us to the
taking of arms, but an holy desire of protecting and defending our selves
against the oppressors of our freedom and our true and Orthodoxall religion.
As touching the aid we have from the Turk and the Tartar we reserve them for
no other end, but to let the king of Poland and Moldauia see, that we want not
wherewithal to serve our selves in time of need; it being in our power to send
them back again when it shall please us. Now although we know that of all
antiquity the Duchy of Silisie does appertain as an inheritance of the realm
of Hungary, yet were we willing to entertain their good neighborhood, living
in good peace and amity, which heretofore we have kept inuiolably. Wherefore
we thought convenient to inform you rightly of our deed, and likewise to
eertifie you that we persuade our selves you have no sinister opinion of us for
employing our powers in so good and so just a cause, which certainly is yours
also, both being in very deed as it were embarkt in the self same vessel: nay
we further are of this belief, that you calling to mind our ancient league
of amity, will rather commend then dispraise, our just and resolute
enterprise: Concerning which point, we humbly pray you to let us freely
understand of your advise, deferring until some more convenient time to make
you an ample discovery of our deliberation, which neither was nor is to war
upon the kingdom of Bohemia, nor Silesia, nor the Marquis of Morauia, unless
they give us too much occasion: howbeit we know very well they have
heretofore been under the crown of the realm of Hungary. But as heretofore
we have often told you, our desire is to employ all our forces against those
destroiers, firers, murderers and massacrers of our brethren, with which
instruments the house of Ametria, has so long to our great mischief, reard up
his crest. We thought it therefore necessary and convenient (most famous,
magnificent and noble Lords) to certify you of these things in few words to
whom (for a conclusion) we wish all goodness and happiness. Dated at our
royal City of Cassouie, the 24. of April. 1605.

Lordships: Nicholas Signoy, Stephen Egidi, Michael Bengalithi, John Beteoffy,

Sicilia.
