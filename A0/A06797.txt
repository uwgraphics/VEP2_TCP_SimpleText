The poor man pays for all.
This is but a dream which here shall ensue:
But the Author wishes his words were not true.
To the tune of In slumbring sleep I lay.


AS I lay musing all alone,
upon my resting bed,
Full many a cogitation
did come into my head:
And waking from my sleep, I
my dream to mind did call,
Me thought I saw before mine eyes,
how poor men pays for all.
A many objects did behold,
in this my frightfull Dream,
A part of them I will unfold:
and though my present Theme
Is but a fancy you may say,
yet many things not fall
Too true alas: for at this day
the poor man pays for all.
Me thought I saw (which caused my care)
what I wish were a fable,
That poor men still enforced are
to pay more then they are able:
Me thought I heard them weeping say,
their substance was but small,
For rich men will bear all the sway,
and poor men pay for all.
Me thought I saw how wealthy men
did grind the poor men's faces,
And greedily did prey on them,
not pitying their cases:
They make them toil and labor sore
for wages too too small:
The rich men in the Tauernes rore:
but poor men pay for all.
Me thought I saw an Usurer old,
walk in his For-sur'd gown,
Whose wealth and eminence controld
the most men in the Towns:
His wealth he by extortion got,
and rose by others fall,
He had what his hands earned not,
but poor men pay for all.
Me thought I saw a Courtier proud
go swaggering along,
That unto any scarce allowed
the office of his tongue:
Me thought, were not for bribery,
his Peacocks plumes would fail,
He russles out in bravery,
but poor men pay for all.
Me thought I met (sore discontent)
some poor men on the way,
I asked one whither he went
so fast and could not stay?
Quoth he, I must go take my Lease,
or else another shall:
My Landlords riches do increase,
but poor men pay for all.
The second part.
To the same tune*


ME thought I saw most stately wives,
go ietting on the way,
That live delightful idle lives,
and go in garments gay,
That with the moon their shapes do change
or else thei'l chide and brawle,
Thus women go like monsters strange,
and poor men pay for all,
Me thought I was in the Country,
where poor men take great pains,
And labor hard continually,
only for-rich men's gains,
Like th'Israelites in Egypt,
the poor are kept in thrall:
The taskmasters are playing kept.
but poor men pay for all.
Me thought I saw poor Tradesmen
ith'City and elsewhere,
Whom rich men keep as heads-men,
in bondage care and fear:
Thei'l have them work for what they list,
thus weakest go to the wall,
The rich men eat and drink the best,
but poor men pay for all.
Me thought I saw two Lawyers base
one to another say.
We have had in hand this poor man's Case,
a twelue-month and a day.
And yet weel not contented be
to let the matter fall,
Bear thou with me and Ile-beare with thee,
while poor men pay for all,
Me thought I saw a red-nose Oast,
as fat as he could wallow,
Whose carka^sse, if it should be roast,
would drop seven stone of tallow,
He grows rich out of measure,
with filling measure small,
He lives in mirth and pleasure,
but poor men pay for all.
And so likewise the Brewer stout,
the Chaudler and the Baker,
The Mault-man also without doubt,
and the Tobacco-taker,
Though they be proud and stately grown,
and bear themselves so tall,
Yet to the world it is well known,
that poor men pay for all.
Even as the mighty Fishes still,
do feed upon the less;
So rich men, might they have their will,
would on the poor men ceaze:
It is a proverb old and true,
that weakest go toth' wall,
Rich men can drink till the sky look blue,
but poor men pay for all.
But now, as I before did say,
this is but a Dream indeed,
Though all dreams prove not true, some m(...)
hap right as I do read.
And if that any come to pass,
I doubt this my Dream shall:
For still it is found too true a case,
that poor men pay for all.
FINIS.
