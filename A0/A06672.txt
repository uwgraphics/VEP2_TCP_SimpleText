To my very good friend Master T. A. Gentleman of the middle Temple.
SIR, the Author of this Book, willing to shrowde his imperfect work, under
the covert of some such well minded Gentleman, that might defend it from the
greedy gripe of such bolde-faced bussards, as commonly use to prey upon the
works of young wits: and of himself altogether unprovided for that purpose,
has entreated me to make some means for his help herein: at whose instant
request, I have presumed to commit to your self, this imperfect work: which,
please it you but to accept, in part of payment, for that debt of duty,
wherein I stand bound unto you: it shall encourage me when his idle hours shall
better furnish some more substantial subject, to pleasure you with that: who
now am bold to presume upon your patience with this. I cease: being, I am
that I am, and while lliue, will live, to love you.

Yours in all love, C. K.

The life and death of the old Duke The first Chapter.
BEfore the many spacious parts of the wide Roman Empire, had subjected
themselves to the government of one principal head, there lived in those
parts of Italy which now men call Florence, a Duke named Radulpho, one whom
nature had beautified in every external part of the body, and wisdom
adorned with all internal gifts of the mind, who from the first spring of his
happy birth, to the ripe years of his hopeful age, so effectually prospered,
as that he lived no less renowned for his worthy atchieuements abroad, then
admired for his wise government at home, being generally for them both
accounted the principal Peer that then that part of the world did afford: So
that as from the heart the beginning of life proceeds vigore to every
several organ of the body: so from him as the fountain of matchless honor,
daily issued such Crystal streams of magnanimous behavior toward his foes,
and courteous humanity to his friends, as made him the wonder of that world,
being then but newly reduced from the barbarous behavior of the savage
Satires, to the civil government of obedient subjects. This blessed prince in
the prime of his prosperous years, chose to wife a Lady of his own Country
called Dorabella, a woman as virtuous as beauteous, and as plentiously
replenished with commendable behavior, as gloriously adorned with matchless
feature, so that it might be judged how gods and nature had in these two
only exceeded themselves, in affoording none, whose love might counteruail the
matchless liniaments of that more then earthly creature, he only excepted,
nor any beauty of such power as to conquer his maiden affections, if she to
that purpose had not especially been selected. Many sunshine days full of
blessings over their heads, and every year seemed to exceed another, in
heaping still renewing pleasures into their plentiful lappes, walling them
round about with impregnable felicity, that they might proudly oppose
themselves against the hardest brunts of Fortunes extremity. Amongst all
which favors one especially, not the least, though almost the last, was this,
that at one birth, this worthy duchess brought into the world two male twins,
the right patrons of their royal parents, whose coming was not a little welcome
to the secure inhabitants of that very well governed Dukedom. In that heavens,
and their happy stars had so effectually answered their longing hopes, in
the issue of those loving princes. These joyful parents carefully foreseeing,
that their forward children might answer their toward growth in commendable
qualities, fitting such royal pesonages, thought it most convenient, when the
stealing hours of ever running time had made them able to conceive the
principals of learning and knowledge, to provide for them such men of skill, as
well in good letters, as arts and sciences, as also fit directers as might
tutor their tender years, in the timely practice of such worthy exercises, as
are best in esteem with men of so high estate: which done, they spent the
process of their pleasant days, favored of gods, and beloved of men, blessing
that golden age wherein they lived, for that no former days had felt so
fauourale aspects of smiling heavens, to eternish their memory through all
succeeding posterities, until the date of their smiling days began to grow
out, and the forerunners of ensuing death, gins to admonish them of the speedy
end of their so pleasant life, Whenas now the old king, spending those
pleasant hours in melancholy contemplation, as best fitting the humor of gray
heads which he was wonted to ouerpasse in delightsom contentation, fitly
agreeing with the vnripened thoughts of young wits, calls to his drowping mind
the fickle estate of this worldly felicity, of which men persuade themselves
there is no certainty, but this that is uncertain, soon sprowting like a
summers flower, after the spring dew of a pleasant morning, prowdly spreading
the sweet leaves, to the warm beams of the comfortable Sun, and when the
heat of one day is ouerworne, faintly decays, and blots the former show as
though it had never been borne: alluding his former life to the pleasant
travail of a waifaring man, that having ouerpassed a great deal of the day
wandering in a pleasant dale, at last must work up his way to the hie top of a
weary hill, from whose height he may again look at the overcome pleasures of
his forenoones journey. And thus sighing to himself often recites in his aged
memory, the pleasant days of his youthful iolitie: the very thought whereof
had bin sufficient to have drowned himself in a gulf of sorrow, had not his
lively picture perfectly pourtrayed in the youthful behavior of his young
sons persuaded him, that part of his soul was divided into their bodies. And
thus feeding his old conceit with the hope of his forward children, he so
pleasantly spent the painful days of his unpleasant age in the very
remembrance of his succeeding heirs, as though himself had shaken off the
silver cognizance of unwieldy age, and felt again the warm springing blood of
aduenterous youth, til after the revolution of many years, as every beginning
of necessity has his end, every day by course his night, and every spring by
kind his fall of leaf, so attendant upon his life was the all ending time of
too timely death, whose approach prefigured by many infallible tokens, makes him
wisely and warily provide against his uncertain coming, lest at unawares he
might be suddenly taken in his secure living.

And as the first and greatest care that troubled his weary mind, he calls
before him his two sons, the pillars that were after to support the heavy
burden of the good government of that common wealth, which yet lay upon his
own shoulders: who coming to the bed side where their father lay, performing
such duty as naturally belongs to parents from the children: and sorrowful
to behold their old father laboring so earnestly with the weary assaults of
never tired death, swelling sorrow plentifully flows out at the crystal
condites of their star like eyes in pearlelike drops of brinie salt tears.
Which when their old sire beheld, giving charge to some of his attendants there
by to set him up in his bed, for by this had the bloody conflicts of al
deuoring death almost druncke up all the moisture of his sometimes well
moistened members, and using some persuasions to his greeuing sons to desist
from their weeping, he thus begins to dispose of his earthly riches. Since
(quoth he) the common course of continual years in the flourishing and fading
fruits of our mother Earth daily decipher to our therefore greeuing thoughts the
unconstant state of our here abode may sufficiently persuade and induce you to
conceive the occasion that has brought me your old father to be a weak
souldior as here you see in the lists of death, who have past the spring of my
growth, the summer of my flourishing, the Autumn of my fading must now like a
dried leaf fall in the comfortless bosom of cold killing winter, at whose
end you must begin, whose death must be your life, and whose fall the step
wherein you must tread to arise: then take truce a while with the unbridled
course of nature, and learn with patience to loose that which care can not
keep, your many tears may occasion some hurt to you, but were they more then
they are, they could not al help me, when this conquering captain, under whose
cruel hand lies vanquished your sometimes vanquishing father, prowdly
triumphed in the treble victory of your worthy grandsire, to whom my self
was sole heir, he, though rich, yet left me poor, and though I succeeded in
the possession of much wealth, yet was I then but slenderly stored with
wisdom, so that what he had carefully got I at the first as carelessly spent,
til the experience of some few years, though it were somewhat long, yet was it
not too late, enriched me with the one, as he had stored me with the other:
both which I leave more amply to you then I did plentifully receive them of
him. Then taking in hand his crown, this heaven, quoth he, which I like Atlas
have long supported, must I now lay upon your shoulders, and on you two
disloade this heavy burden which has so long been only borne by me. Break
it I may not in twain, whose golden circle closes so many in one, containing
the welfare of as many people within this ring, as the Atlantike sea compasses
in her greedy arms. Division brings forth discord, discord confusion,
confusion desolation which woeful end to prevent by a good beginning, I have
thus contrived: Twins you are both, and therefore in birth equal. Thou (quoth
he) Perseus to his eldest son art a scholar richly adorned with the great
gift of godlike learning, and therefore might challenge a prerogative above
thy brother: but that Theseus speaking then to his youngest son, has as far
exceeded thee in the practice of a soldier, as thou him in the profession of
a scholar: so that being joined together, you would make one perfect man, but
severed, are two maimed members. It is reported of the Pelican, that with her
own blood she revived her dead young, and so I though wanting blood to recall
you from the dead pleasures of young secure delights, yet shall my latest breath
counsel you to the careful desire of virtuous deeds. The Raven so long as she
is able to provide meat for her young, will never let them fly from her sight,
and so fares it with me, willing still to enjoy your desired companies as long
as I might: but since I am now too weak to swim against so great a current as
is this sea of death, that drowneth in eternal oblivion whatsoever the world
has brought forth since her first creation, I must here urged of necessity
leave that which willingly I would prolong. And therefore in a word I bequeath
to you this crown and kingdom, which your forefathers for many years have
royally vpholden, be as one soul in two bodies, two men, but one mind, two
hands governed by one head. Let thy wit direct his weapon, and his weapon
defend thy wit. There is a root in Libia that bears two bulkes, which as
long as they cleave together prosperously flourish, but being severed they
soon fade. Great streams that forcibly break forth of the bowels of mighty
mountains, keeping their course together within compass of two banks, forcibly
prevail against al oppositions, but being separated, their force decreases,
and themselves in the end decay. There are two friendly fishes always keeping
company together, opposing themselves against the mightiest monsters that the
sea affoords, but when by any sinister occasion they are separated, then are
they easily overcome by smaller creatures then themselves. Be not proud least
you be hated, nor too humble, for then will you be despised: hear the
complaints of the poor, and then shall you be beloved, and punish the
misdeedes of the wicked, and so shall you be feared. Surfeit not with drinking
much wine, for that will breed folly, nor accompany with many women, for
thence comes all iniquity. Use your sports in measure, and defer not your
weighty affairs for the love of vain pleasure. Do justice with all
sincerity, and let not your punishment taste too much of severity. Take heed
of the cry of Orphans, for that ascends to heaven, and procures speedy
vengeance: and incur not the curse of widows, for that weyes down to hell,
from whence there is no redemption. Well could I wish that my now decaying
breath were not so sore urged by impartial death, to leave this concaue
castle of my panting breast, that I might more enrich you with that good,
whereof you shall have far more need then of much gold: but what heaven
prouides, cannot by us be prevented, and therefore must I leave you to your
fortunes, which prove as prosperously as your father wishes it heartily. And
so kissing both his sons, and making some signs still of more matter, when
his weak tongue had denied any more to perform his office, and shortly after
turning his face to the wall, ended his days.

The mutual succession of his sons in his Dukedom. The second Chapter.
AFter whose death, his sons carefully prouides to order all things in the
best order for the adorning of their fathers funeral. All which done, the
funeral rites solemnised, and every thing fully brought to end, all which
after, they, according to the solemn custom of their civil country,
sumptuously had performed, they took order for their coronation, which was also
in every part effectually discharged, as they had orderly devised, so that now
it rested for them jointly to go forward in the peaceable government of that
quiet common wealth, which their deceased father had left unto their careful
furtherance. Long time did they mutually agree, and with brotherly love
increaseed, by their more and common accord, as well the obedient duty of their
homeborne subjects, as the admirable love of foreign strangers. Their lives
were delightful objects to every eye, and sweet subjects to the talk of
every tongue, no Country, but imitated to live by them, nor any people were
they never so far distant, that longed not to see them. But as none are more
subject to great falls* then they which travel upon high hills, no tree so
soon smitten with the thunderclap as Jupiters Oak, no, nor any Pine sooner
moved, then they that grow on the mountains: so is there no state likelier to
be trod down with the adverse chance of cruel confusion, then that which
stands above all, if it be not the better supported with the strong props of
prudent advice.

The marriage of the young Princes, and the birth of their children, and the
accidents that followed betwixt their wives and children. The third Chapter.
Soon after these two young Princes were thoroughly seated in the stable throne
of their dead father, matched themselves in marriage with wives fitting their
Majesty's, with whom also they long and very lovingly lived, and in time their
fortunes sorted to such effect, as that Perseus his wife, whose name was
Emelia, brought forth a goodly son which they named Adrian. And not long
after fortune blessed Theseus the other brother with the like good luck, that
Liuia (for so was his wife called) bore to him a fair daughter, naming her
Berea, of whose birth as much joy was hoped, as by the blessed reign of their
fathers and forefathers, happiness of that land had been received. But as
often it falls out in the fairest days, that they are soonest foiled with the
close veil of many clustring clouds: the forwardest spring either burned with
the extremity of great heat, or drowned with the abundance of much wet: so
fared it with the hie puffed up glory of these peerlesse princes. For they
thus prodigally rifling in the treasure of earthly felicity, were soon
bankrouts of their so pleasant prosperity. The envious pride of these two
Queens (a thing as proper belonging to women as death to men) could not content
themselves to divide the even glory of that equal kingdom, but either of them
climbed for superiority, sought to cut the golden thread of their husbands
unity, which when their weak womanish devises could by no means effect, but
that still their ambitious attempts were politikely prevented. Liuia sorting a
fit time when she might take Theseus her husband at the best advantage,
finding hin one time solitarilie walking in a pleasant garden under a high
ouerspred vault of top-spreading vines, gins thus to unfold the pestered
rancour of her malicious swelling heart.

Husband (quoth she) see thou not how envious fates, and our hard bending
stars, has unluckily crossed the springing hopes of our aire-mounting
thoughts in the succession of this kingdom, of which, for our offspring is a
female, and theirs a male, of necessity they must succeed, and our name and
lineal descent lie buried in the mistie forge of slavish obscurity. Then since
there is no hope of equality in our succession, lift up thy Eagle-mounting
thoughts, and challenge some superiority in this present possession, equal thy
brother in blessing, since ye are equal in birth, and enjoy that thy self
whilst thou live, that thy child shall loose when thou art dead. Me thinks
it were but right to thee, and just in the brother, to yield that now to thee,
which he shall afterward enjoy in another. Means have thou many to effect this
thing, time and thy state offer fit occasion, and reason may lead thee to
consider the equity of this cause by my former persuasion. Thee has fortune
richly blessed with the manlike like knowledge of martial affairs, and to thy
custody is committed the tuition of as many men, as were able to ouerrun the
wide face of the spacious world, if but thou would but join thy exceeding
will. Then being fenced with such a force, if induced thereunto with forceable
arguments of persuading truth, he would not consent, thou may forcibly
assail his with conquering arms, which he can no ways prevent.

And thus breaking off her perswasiue oration, she silently attendes to hear
her husbands answer: when the good king not a little grieved to hear the bad
disposition of his wife, thus painted forth by her envious tongue, gins to
persuade her from those traiterous thoughts (as then he called them) which
stirred her up to this inhumaine rebellion.

Ah (quoth he) Liuia, hatred is a thing hated of God above all sin, a fault
betwixt two enemies, a sin betwixt two friends, but betwixt two brethren more
then most wicked. Shall the branches of one bulk better prosper by beating
down each others fruit Can the legs of one body support their burden by
spurning each other? And can the one soul of two brother king, knit fast by
the dying precept of one old father, prosper their well ordered wealth by
disordered war? Wish not our fall for ever, to satisfy thy aspiring mind for a
while: for whilst we mutually accord, both of us shall flourish: but when we
break the golden cord wherewith our old father knit his two sons, then
shall our state soon fall. Leave any further to urge the thought of this thing,
which to think is more sin then many thousand other misdeeds. Never shall his
heavy curse light on my head, that committed this care to my charge.

And thus abruptly* breaking off his disswasiue Oration, in great fury he
leaves the Garden, and cloisters up himself in his private study, giving
straight charge that no man should be so bold as to interrupt his melancholy
meditation, till such time as himself should command the contrary, where for
a while we must leave him, laboring to suppress the still renewing sorrow that
this bold attempt of his wicked wife had brought to his before quiet mind, and
follow the never dying pride of this aspiring woman, who seeing her husband to
reprove her so bitterly for moving a suit, wherein she hoped to have him most
sure, determined with her self, to use other means for the performance of her
intended purpose, though she had thus failed in her first attempt, which long
she studied to bring to effect, fearing to use any other counsel then her own,
least she should be bewraied, and leaving to use any help more then her own,
least thereby she might be betrayed.

The pretended murder of Adrianus by his Aunt and her servants, and what
happened thereof, with his life in the Lions den by whom he was found. The
fourth Chapter.
AFter many confused plots for her purpose, she called unto her an old servant
of hers, in whom, for his age and long dutiful service, she reposed much trust:
and after she had adjured him by all the benefits and good turns that he had
plentifully received at her liberal hands, that he should secretly conceal
and surely effect what she was now about to commit unto his charge: which for
that the slave was as bloudilie affected to perform any vilanie, as she
boldly addicted to devise this treachery, he did not only swear to conceal
this her counsel, and effect her devise, but also offered himself as most
ready to spend limme and life in an^^ sort that might do her service. This
pleasing answer so pleased the working humor of this wicked woman as that
taking aside this ready prepared varlet for the execution of her bloody
devise, begins thus to instruct him in her intent. Many (quoth she) are like to
be the calamities likely to ensue upon our stock and offspring, which in time
to prevent I have thus timely invented a mean to prevent their beginnings, and
so quite remove the fearful event of so unlucky an end as is likely to ensue
thereof. Do thou not (quoth she) observe the unequal hope of our future
happiness in the possession of this present kingdom, I mean in our heirs?
and think thou not I have reason with timely prevention, to resist their
untimely purpose, would it not grieve thee, when the uncertain hour of most
certain death, shall cut the golden thread that holds the lives of these two
kings, to see thy masters, and my husbands daughter, who should equally enjoy
the succession of this crown, disinherited from the possession thereof by our
brothers son. If this so inwardly touch a stranger, ah, would it not much more
grieve me that am her mother. Our sorrows are more then our words are any
wise able to express: And therefore greater then the common help of ordinary
comfort can in any part redress. Woes showed in tears are washed away with
the same sorrow, painted forth by the tongue vanishes to air with the words:
But the incarnate care of almost remediless evil cannot so lively be in
outward action expressed, as in the inward closure of a true sorrowful heart
they are fully possessed: which care the unhappy course of ever ruling heaven
has thrown heavily upon my head, whereof to discharge my self there is no
remedy but one, and no one can effect it but thy self, upon whose trust must
I build as great (...) foundation, as contains the quiet and good end of all this nation. More persuasions and they more perswasiue too then these, could I
use to thee, that might induce thee with more alacrity, to do what I shall
devise: but relying upon the ready endeavor in the execution of this secret
business, I will thus acquaint thee with my purpose. Thou know how heaven has
blessed our brother Perseus with a goodly son, to whom I could wish much good,
if it were not to mine own harm. He, when the course of al outliuing time
shall take away his father, and my husband, must of necessity alone possess
that which they now jointly enjoy, then shall the issue of our bodies live in
subjection to him, who else should perform as much duty to them, which no
ways we can eschew. But, and there she suddenly stopped, as though her faltring
tongue had denied to proclaim the hellish practice she had plotted. Which when
her servant perceived, imagining somewhat should follow that interrupt period,
boldly attempted to continue her almost repentant speech. Nay (quoth he) let
not your Majesty be afraid to commit to my secrecy any thing that shall tend
to your acceptable service. For so fast has the much meriting bond of your
bounteous liberality, tied me to the dutiful obeisance of your Majesty, that
should you impose a greater labor to my performaunce then Juno to her
Hercules, lay a far more heavy burden on my neck, then the heavens to
supporting Atlas, commit a greater charge to my watchful care, then Jupiter to
his all eied Argus, I would spend al my days in travailing with Alcides, my
strength in bearing with Atlas, mine C. eyes in watching with Argos, but I
would fully effect whatsoever you should thus faithfully commit to my diligent
endeavor. So great is the love that I bear both to your self the plentiful
patron of my present estate, and your fair child, of whom I expect as much
succeeding happiness, as I possess present hope, that were it to rid both
your brother, and his hateful son, I should not only think my labor employed
to a good end, but also my toil easy to be performed, and hope my soul
should be everlastingly rewarded, for my no more then dutiful service. At which
words the Queen now fully fleshed to adventure upon his so vilde an endeavor,
begins now in plain words to discover what before under a Curten she had
somewhat colored, vnripping the hidden thoughts of her self-known heart, to
the longing ears of her ready attendant, thus began to inform him in her
fore-plotted mischief.

Then (quoth she) since thou so willingly offerest what I did more then half
fear to ash, and have so rightly met with mine own meaning, I presume upon
thy trust to tell what is the secretest wish of my unquiet will. My brother
(quoth she) has a son, which I wish either he had not, or my self were not:
and yet not hate to him, but love to my self is it that urges me to do that
to him, which else his life would effect in me. His moist blood is the liquour
which only must quench my dry thirst: and the end of his days ad new date, to
the decaying number of my years, which if thou will but effect, as I will
advise, I will clearlie acquit thee of his death, and richly reward thee for
that deed. Remember to what I may prefer thee, from which his life does
defer^e thee: what profit thou may gain by the one, and what misery thou
art like to incur by the other. For assure thy self, that it thou now deny
the performance of my request, when I have uncovered the effect of my drift, I
will not only work thy utter disgrace, but hasten thy shameful decay. At
which words, the fellow standing as one in a trance, loath (as it should
seem) so heynously to offend, though he had rashly made so ready an offer,
would neither affirmatively at the first answer her demand, nor negatiuely
deny her desire, til she waking him out of his drowsy dumpe, asked him if he
would boldly go forward with his fore-pretended purpose, which for that his
promise before past (as he thought) though wickedly concluded, yet could not
well be recalled, made him again (after she had rowsed his drowsy spirits with
the golden sound of rich rewards) make a solemn vow to effect what business
soever she should appoint him. And she taking her time to strike upon an hot
iron, thus followed her fore-purpose.

This night (quoth she) for longer we may not delay it, I have devised ready
means how the boy should be delivered into thy hand, and yet thou never
suspected as any way accessarie to this privy massacre. A Gentlewoman here
attendant upon me, whom I also have sworn to our purpose, shall when the sable
mantle of the silent night couers the lightsome face of all seeing heaven, for
that she is well acquainted, and most familiar with those to whose watchful
charge our careful brother has wholly referred the trustful tutorage of his
child, being in the government of an easy nurse, resort down to the
nurserie, and being there, merrily addicted to spend the long hours of the
winter evening, at her fittest time, when she has busied both the eyes and
ears of those simple people, with some such pleasant conceit, as well she
knows will best fit their vain humor, with the pleasing show of some such
vain delight, as fitliest agrees with the wanton disposition of a harmless
child, draw him forth of the doors, where in a long dark entry adjoining
thereunto, shall thou privily stand to attend his coming. And when she has
allured the child from the sight of his attendants, she shall again return to
her company, and proceed in her former mirth, busying their idle heads with
the vain prattle of some obscure riddle, a thing with such people in great
esteem, whilst thou (like the greedy puttocke) hastily seazing upon that
goodly prey, shall forthwith make al possible speed, to convey him into the
vast bosom of a solitary desert, near adjoining the City. Where when ehou
have brought him, without any remorse by some quick means, make a hasty end
of his betrayed life, and disfiguring his body, leave his dead carkas to be the
hungry prey of some empty beast, whence thou may safely return without the
blushing mark of jealous suspicion. Fear not what may iusue the event of this
action, for that none can accuse thee so much as of suspicion. The speechless
child made breathless by this means, shall never live to learn thy name: and
for all other eyes, the dark sable vale of still silent night, will either lull
them into a secure slumber, or pen them up in the strong enclosure of their
quiet homes, through whose hard flintie walls, the feeble sight of their weak
eyes cannot work.

And thus having intised the seely fool to consent to her folly, after they
had fully agreed upon the time, place, and other necessary circumstances, she
with many fair promises of rich rewards, sent him away, where the cruel
caitife still iterating in his mind the hope of reward, and never respecting
the fear of such punishment, as by the just judgment of the highest heaven,
hang heavy over the sinful heads of so great offenders, spent away all that
day, til the weary Sun having finished his still running journey, and that al
things began now leave their daily labor, and betake themselves to their nightly
rest, he still mindful of his vow, resorted accordingly to the place and time
before appointed, where he had not long attended, before the gentlemwoan
appointed to play the prologue of this sudden murder came by, and having in all
points duly observed she strait charge of her subtle mistress, in the secret
intising forth of the weak limmed child, she at length effected it. And
delivering him over into the bloody hands of this butcherly beast, returns
again her self, to consort her former company: where after they had spent a
great part of the night in such chat as loose tongued women commonly accustom
at their idle meetings, at last, for that the night was somewhat spent, or for
some other occasion, they broke off their talk.

When the betrayed nurse looking for her charge, missed the child, suddenly
using means to enquire al about the house, wherein they spent so much time at
home, that their harmless infant without al contradiction was easily conveyed
abroad. Hard news were these to those woeful parents, that in the midst of
their Summer sun, were so suddenly counteruailed with a winters storm. Much
search was made, many examinations were had, and al other means were used that
might any wise tend to the finding out again of this so strangely lost Prince,
that being safe in his fathers house, strongly guarded with the sure diligence
of faithful servants, carefully kept by the dutiful service of diligent
attendance, notwithstanding in the midst of al his fathers men, the surest
place of his princely house, and in the bosom of his nearest nurse, should be
so strangely conveyed: which what grief it was to those so loving parents, I
leave to their consideration that have tasted the loss of so sweet children.

And now to return again to our more then deceitful Sinon, who by this time
had quite passed the bounds of the City, and tracing up and down the obscured
ways of an unpeopled forest, could find no fit place to execute this
detestable murder, til at the last the pale faced Queen of the shadie night
gins in her silver coach to search the secret corners of the darkest dens,
obscure shadows, when he tracing up and down to find out some fit place for
his purpose, at the length happened upon a thick groan of broad Cypres trees,
the fatal covert of whose envious branches seemed unto him as the fiftest place
he could find for to execute his abominable practice, There setting down the
pretty child. who although his tender years had not yet affoorded him so
much reason, as to guess at the event of this forced journey, yet did the
unacquainted manner of his carriage, the unusual time of the night, and the
unpleasant temperature of the cold air* urge vehement the cries of the silly
infant to yield such dreadful exclamations, from every resounding Echo of
these unpeopled plains, as would have stirred the hateful hearts of
unrelenting savages to have pitied his childish complaints, til this more then
bloody minded beast, stripping the poor infant from the most of his outward
attire, as meaning not only to deprive him of his life, but also to leave his
princely body so naked, that no man should by any outward appearance descerne
what, or from whence he should be conveyed. Long it was or his unaccustomed
hands could find the way to unfurnish the poor infant of his outward attire,
when in the midst of his troublesome business he suddenly heard, as it had
been the furious approach of some hasty beast. When he looking through thin
branches of a young leaued Laurel, might by the light of the Moon, which by
this had climed the highest point of the ^^wling sphere, perceive a hasty
Lioness, secretly searching the hidden bottom of every several bush. For as
it should seem the recovery of some late losses, which by the sequel might
be judged none otherwise, but that some watchful woodman taking the advantage
of her absence, had cunningly conveyed away her young whelps, while she was
iourneying abroad to provide some speedy relief for their sustenance, who
returning back to her desolate den, and finding herself deprived of her
young, was woefully searching what she had unwillingly lost, with fearful
approach so affrighted the guilty conscience of this murdering miscreant, as
that leaving the young child to the greedy prey of this angry beast, made al
speedy haste to save himself from her fearful fury, which he so speedily
performed, that in short time he rid himself from the fear of the forest.
But as every sin cannot escape his several punishment, so had the just
censure of all judging heaven appointed a worthy reward for this his wicked
work. For even at the furthest bounds of the broad plained forest, a hungry
bear seeking sustenance, to relieve her insaciate desire of meat, suddenly
encountered him so near, that though his footmanship was more then ordinary,
yet it nothing prevailed to help him from this extremity. For so near the
bold beast followed his still flying steps, that ere he could get almost my way
from their first meeting place, she had eagrely seized on his now
feare-falling body. And she now as far from mercy, in peecemeale tearing
him, as he from pity in rigorously abusing the other, had in short time buried
in her beastly belly, his sinful members that had justly deserved such equal
measure, remunerating him in this fashion, for the vengeance meriting
transgressio^. By this the woeful Lioness for her unexpected want, had by
traversing round about those spacious plains searching every shadow, and
boldly ransacking ye covered bottom of every bush, egerly following her hot
pursuit, came at length to the place, where the young forsaken infant lay
pitifully complaining and weakly struggling to seek that succor which that
barren place did not afford. Which when the savage beast had suddenly espied,
leaving her further pursuit, began contrary to her kind, quietly to view the
forsaken estate of that forlorn infant, whose pitiful case did, as it should
seem, work more remorce in that reasonlesse creature, then it had done in his
nearest kin: for after she had with her feet in the easiest manner that she
could, turned it up and down sadly ouerlooking this woeful loss, differing
from her natural kind, and forgetting both the sorrow and fear of her own
young, making shift as she could to lap again the child in those clothes
which the fugitive murderer had for fear left behind, made such means, as
that taking up the child by those clothes, she in her teeth conveyed him to a
sorrowful den, meaning to supply her former loss, by this new found spoil,
where we will a while leave Adrianus son to this the forenamed worthy Perseus
in the unkindly covert of a lions den to the tutorage of a wild beast, that
was naturally descended from the offspring of civil men, and return to see
their sorrow at the court for this sudden loss, which was no less grievous
than the thing it self was great. Many posts were every way dispatched to make
inquiry, lest peradventure by the sly deceit of some subtle enemy he might
have been stolen for a pledge: proclamations in every place were made, and
promises of rich reward for them that could bring any tidings of this lost
child, which being without help, perished without hope: wherein when they had
spent much time to small purpose, they surceased their search, hoping that one
day the length of time would discover the effect of this truth.

In the mean while the subtle Queen, by whose means this pretended murder
was thus closely wrought, would be nothing behind in the often resorting to
her sorrowful sister, using much perswasiue counsel, as well to decrease her
grief, as sheading many womanish tears, to seem as it were a great partaker
of her sorrow, thinking by this means to remove the blemish of suspicion from
her self. But that which troubled her most was, that many days being
ouerrunne since the deed was supposed to be done, she heard no word of the
return of her servant, whom to this end she had appointed. But persuading
herself by many circumstances, that the thing it self was effected, she
grounded her conceit upon this, the fellow wisely foreseeing how the hardest
thing hid is the easiest found, surest counsel sometime soonest disclosed, and
faithfullest trust proves many times the foulest treachery, had left this
country, and betaken him self to live elsewhere, where he might be free from
whatsoever calamity might come upon it. From whom she secretly desired to
hear, though she were out of all hope to see him. And thus leaving no
circumstance unsought into, no devise vndealt withal, no plot unperformed, that
might remove from her the envious eyes of jealous suspicion: She spent many
days until such time as this untimely loss was almost forgotten of them all.
Thus having brought every thing to the bent of her own bow, and feeding
herself with successiue hope of her daughter, who now was only heir to that
rich dowry, she determined no more to assay any other assault, for the quick
dispatch of her other brother, thereby the sooner to possess solely to
herself, wherein she was strongly counterchecked by an other. But as in the
fading time of drooping Autumn, no wind seldom rises without more foul
weather, no cloud that brings not with him a present storm, and neither
wind nor storm, but are still renewing, til they have quite disarmed trees of
their leaves, fields of their flowers, and flowers of their fruits: So did the
unconstant course of their maleuolent aspects, power dwne upon them such
winter storms of continuing calamity, as never left their unhappy house, til
it had quite nipped al their flowers, lopped their leaves, and almost rent up
the original roots.

The pretended purpose of Liuia for the murdering of her brothers daughter,
and the event thereof. The fifth Chapter.
Now the same malecontented mind that drove this sister to the deuelish
devising of so damnable an endeavor, began also to work the like in the other.
She now perceiving all her rest quite bereft, her growing hope so soon turned
to dying mishap, and her merry thoughts to mournful sighs, thus spoiled of al
her pleasure, gins devise how she might get a partaker in her pain. Long
wandered her weary thought in the tedious laberinth of many, no less doubtful
then dangerous endeavors, sometimes studying on this thing, another time
standing on that thing, like the unacquainted trauailer, that meeting with the
many windings of several ways, for want of some instruction is half doubtful
where his way lies: so she, seeing with the eyes of her affections many ways,
as good as herself can wish wantes, means to affect them according to her
will, yet as there is nothing so obscure, but with much labor may be learned: no
work so weary, but toil will ouerturne: no time so tedious, but it may be
outworne: so she at length by ouercasting the count of her several cares, found
a means (as she thought) to quiet her conscience, which for that she
certainly persuaded herself of the firm grounded friendship of her well
meaning husband to his best beloved brother, she durst not be so bold as to
whisper a breath of mislike, or word of wrong-dealing against him or his, yet
notwithstanding, intending to act some far-fetched policy, to bring her
brother and sister, now in the bosom of al earthes blessings, to become fellow
mourners with her in these many miseries, she thus wrought means to effect
her long framing form.

These two princes in the beginning of their peaceful reign, had for their
diversity of delight, about some two or three mile from the City, planted a
fair vineyard, where for their disport themselves in the pleasant time of al
pleasing Summer, would oftentimes resort. There besides the pleasant shades of
broad leaued Vines laden with the heavy burdens of cluster bending Grapes,
the apish imitating workmen, chosen from the chiefest parts of all that
country, had cunningly drawn in the many searching streams of near
adjoining rivers bounding each other in their crickling arms, whose gliding
currants full fraught with many sorts of silver colored fishes, and banks
bordered with all sorts of fruitful flourishing trees, plains peopled with the
curious work of mutating art as the luckelesse love of learned Apollo,
compassing within the circle of his art framed arms the transformed substance
of his dearest Daphne curiously out of a laurel bush. By that on the side of a
pleasant hill, under the covert of an artificial rock stands trembling Acteon
viewing ye well fashioned bodies of many naked nymphs, whose lively portrature
shadowed under the transparant substance of the silver colored stream,
affright the wanton fishes at the sudden sight. Many curious conceits, as
forests of wild beasts framed out of the big bushes timorous hares prosecuted
with the speedy course of well fashioned greyhounds, cut out of the sweet
plants of still springing rosemarie, that shaken with the cold breath of a
sweet southern blast beguile the dazeling eyes of the steadfast beholder, as
though the fast rooted trees liuelily followed the artificial frames with their
resembling forces there, upon Hebars swift streams swimmes Orpheus mourning
harp, whose silver strings softly touched with the easy stroke of the cunning
conveyed water with many tragic strokes bewailes the vnfortuuate act of her
masters end, many curious arbours framed of the diverse sorts of ever
springing plants cuninglie joined and closely covered with their broad shady
leaves, and fresh blown buds, whose ground richly spread with the fair wrought
tapistrie of many sweet flowers might ravish ye unacquainted senses of any
mortal beholder: besides the several musickes of sundry birds, seated upon
the tender sprayes that ouerspreades these heavenly houses in this earthly
paradise, whose skill exceeding the artificial form of sweet tuned strings
feeds the loving desire, with continual delight thither. This wily woman,
though envying at another end, yet under color of recreation and desire of
fresh air, persuaded her husband and his brother with all their trains to
resort: who as glad to satisfy her pleasant seeming conceit which not long ago
had sustained the hard brunt of fell misfortune, as also to drive away such
melancholy matter as yet troubled all their moodie minds, soon assented to
her desire, where when they came, she had foreappointed many several kinds of
sundry delights to draw away the earnest affection of their more serious
affairs: as at their first entrance stood a savage satyr trimmed up in the
broad leaves of an oak branch, whose fierce countenance artificially framed,
as though he had meant to affright their sudden approach, naturally
counterfeited what their Art had colored, and thus boldly begins to
entertain their first entrance:

Fair colored frames of fortunes better sort,
Whom Apish art has decked with others plumes,
Drawn with delight, dainties to resort
Unto this sweet balmed aier with earths perfumes,
Where nature formed in fashion of these springs,
Braues coloring skill in richest courts of kings,
How may the hope of countries power content
Feed the self pleasing souls of clownish swains,
When civil kings leaves cities meriments
To solace them upon the pleasant plains?
Where the green beauty of the fading grass
Presents their shades as through transparent glass,
That when they look, their inward souls may see,
Their bodies borne of earth as well as we.
And when the course of nature cuttes the thread
Of this times servant soon decaying state:
Then kings and base borne beggar being dead,
Princes and pesants prized at one rate,
Where, by succeeding ages shall be found,
Al bodies buried in one self same ground:
Whose dust decayed bodies wanting breath,
Tells the sure sentence of impartial death.
Thus as this discontented resembling savage was about to extend the vain of
his satyricall verse: the company as it should seem not affecting that
melancholy method departed. And iournying further into the pleasant walks of
that flourishing field at the turning corner of a music murmuring spring were
suddenly, encountered with a troop of Trytons finely flourishing in their
silver sounding trumpets, till the master Neptune was behind them, egerly
enticing, and strongly struggling with fair Andromeda, upon the senseless
side of a ruthles rock. From this they were conveyed into a spacious Arbor,
situate in the midst of many shady trees, whose sheltering boughs served as a
covering curtain, to keep away the parching heat of the summers sun, then
at his highest meridionall zenith, where was a curious table richly spread and
fully furnished with all manner of several services, where after they were
orderly placed, and had somewhat satisfied their hungry appetites, suddenly
they were presented with the natural show of nine almost naked virgins,
representing the nine Muses, who decently placed upon the sweet side of a
flowerie bank, began tune their solemn instruments unto the sweet strains of
their angelical voices, amongst whom a goodly fair creature, whose more than
earthly semblance containing in her fair countenance, more carnation colored
beauty, than graced all the goddesses in the vale of Ida, when they prowdly
apparelled, set forth the richest forms of their enticing faces, whose golden
tresses curled in cunning knottes, dangling down her cherrie-stained cheeks,
wauing abroad with the sweet blast of the mildely moving air, seeming
cunningly to kiss her vermillian countenance, whose maiesticall moving looks
forcibly drew all the idle eyes of that present assembly, to wonder at that so
welframed beauty, til she with her fingers the delightful organs of al ruling
fancy, sweetly ginnes strike the trembling strings of an iuorie lute, and
ecchoing with her angelical voice to the silver sound of her well tuned
instrument, sung this following Ditie:

The soon enticed Grecian Dame,
Whose lustful love with Priams joy,
Kindled the fire where grew the flame
That after burnt fair blooming Troy,
When brine-salt tears had burnt away
That pleasant bait of sweet delight,
Which made the youthful prince assay
To steal her from her husbands sight:
Looking within a mirrours view
Upon her withered wrinckling skin,
Then all too late gins to renew
The sorrow for her former sin,
And sending out as many showers
Of tears, that swiftly trickled down,
As would have quenched the flaming towers*
Which lighted Pirrhus to the town,
That night when Troy was ouerturned,
And Graecians swanne in Trojans gore,
When Ilions buildings all were burned,
That never felt fires force before.
Then gins she praise a maidens life,
The golden time of all content
Cursing that day made her a wife,
That wrought her this disparagement:
For if (quoth she) I had traced the wood,
With sacred Dians maiden train,
Then had my vestall life been good,
Who now must pine away in pain,
But be my fall a means to move
Those fair borne creatures of my kind,
To shun in time enticing love,
That captiuates a free borne mind,
For if in time I had foreseen
The end my unbridled will,
This dismal day had never been,
And all Troyes towers had then stood still.
Thus as the heavenly harmony of those earthly goddesses had drawn away the
minds of the ravished beholders, a treacherous slave tutored before, by her
unhappy counsel, closely seized upon the other child her brothers daughter,
and being cunningly conveyed from them at a back gate, which led forth toward
the high steep rocks that seuers the neighbor lands from the fierce invasion
of the furious sea, he in all have hied him thitherward, which for that it was
not far distant, he soon attained, and for that the water was then somewhat
low, and that flood had yet covered again the naked bosom of the broad sands,
seeking in the secret bottom of the unsearchable sea, to bury the small body
of this pretty babe, he was forced to go lower down then willingly he would
have adventured, but that of necessity he must do it, to act that which
before he had invented. Near adjoining to that place within the strong
compass of a nature walled cave, hewed out of the hard bosom of a flintie
rock, was the abode of many exiled people, who for that the laws of their
country had denied them the benefit of peaceful living in their quiet country,
by reason of some great offenses by them committed, had there settled
themselves, whereof some being then placed as Sentinels upon the highest
promontorie of all the borderig shore, looking every way to epsy some
passengers, upon whom they might make their prey, at the length espied this
posting companion hasting to the execution of this harmless child, and loath
to let them escape their hands, some who were readier then the rest, in haste
followed down toward him apace, who by this time was come to the water side,
and being busied about the disfurnishing of the babe, and thinking himself
secure from any approaching company, until at length turning his face suddenly
about, whether to lay away some of the clothes, or reach some necessary thing
as he then wanted, he espied this exiled company hastily coming upon him,
whom for that himself was borne within the confines of that Country, he
straightway knew: and being somewhat acquainted with their manners, that they
were bloody minded men, given over to the rigorous desire of unrighteous
living, and bound under the subjection of no law, (...) fearfully leaving the
child half naked, and half clothed, lying sprawling upon the wet sands,
for such was the number of her tender years, that she could neither speak to
implore relief, neither go to ease herself of that unaccustomed order wherein
he had left her: but he swiftly taking the advantage of his nimble legs, made
al possible speed to escape their coming, who in his hasty flight, not
regarding to take the right way that might readiest direct him out of the
danger of those doubtful sands, was ere he were aware, insconsed within the
trustlesse compass of a soft hollow ground which we call quicksands, where he
suddenly sinking down, was by and by buried in the bottom of the salt flowing
sea, a just reward for his so deuilish desert.

Now were the other, who prosecuted this bad attempt of so shameful a sin, come
unto the place where the helpelesse child lay, pitiously betrayed in the sandy
mire of that moist ground, whose hearts although they were closed up in
unrelenting br^^sts, and were men exercised in naught but murders, and
massacres, yet seeing so goodly a forward child, richly adorned with many
garments of much worth, they took more compassion over it then commonly they
used in the like cases, and carefully carrying it home to their cave, took such
order as the child was well relieved again, that with fear and cold was
almost dead. Her must we leave to accompany them in their savage Cel, and
return to the Princes, who now were swimming in all delight in the pleasure of
their Garden.

Of the accidents that happened these Kings after the death of their children.
The sixth Chapter.
THeir dinner being done, she music withdrawing, and al their sport fully
ended, for that the swift paced Chariot of the Sun drawing through the
Crystal skies, with fiery breathing horses, had now well nigh attained the
end of their weary journey, when these merry disposed people gathering
together, al their company intended to leave the country delights, and return
again to their palace, where when al were gathered together ready to depart,
suddenly was missed the young child. Who first for that they imagined she had
been borne forth for delight, by some of their household servants into the
cool shadow of those Summer groves, where with all speed they duly searched,
but in vain, for none could find though almost al of them were busied in
seeking of her, so that at length, hopeless to find what they so unluckily had
lost, they were forced to return home with as many weeping tears, as they
came forth with smiling ioies. Heavy were the discomforted parents for their
lost child, sad the poor subjects for their Princes pain, and generally
these unexpected accidents, did drive all minds into a deep muse, what strange
fortune should so fowly foil the settled estate of these princely peers, two
beautiful babes even in their cradles so cunningly conveyed from the watchful
eyes of their weary nurses, and no means of suspicion apparent, that might
induce any probable conjecture of their escape. Well, to be short, as the
greatest burdens must with patience be ouerborne, the hardest haps with
humility be helped, and the saddest sorrows with some salues be severed: so
these royal personages, considering the chaungeable estate of unstable chance,
that like the fading flourish of an April day, soon laughing, and soon lowering
again, considering that the misfortune of ill chauncing change, often times in
fair florishes presented, though they may be often foreseen, yet are they
seldom prevented, made them patiently to rely upon hope of al helping heaven,
whose ready power would one day either restore them to their former hopes, or
by the just doom of all ending death, restrain them from al future mishaps.

Thus being both of them divorced from of cherishing children, whose pleasing
presence might recreate the melancholy dispositio^s of their world wearied
minds, they sadly spend the weary remnant of their woeful days, abandoning
all means that might move their mirth, refusing all counsel of comfortable
friends, and delighting in nothing but desperate despair, using their tongues
to tell no tale but tragidies, nothing entered into their ears but the harsh
harmony of pitiful pains, frequenting no pleasant places but the dismal
shows of black Cypress shades, from whose concaue bulks bounds the harsh
hellish noise of the ill boading Owl, fasting the days with sad sighs, and
watching the night with sorrowful slumbers, representing by their lives the
true image of liuelesse death.

The still lasting hate of the proud Queens, the means rhey wrought to
separate the love of their husbands, and the event thereof. The seventh Chapter.
WE heard in the beginning of this history, how Lydia wife to this worthy
Theseus, had assayed with urging arguments of some persuading force, to untwine
the wel-spun threede of fast linking love, betwixt these peaceful and princely
brethren, blessed in all worldly wealth, except the unfortunate choice of two
wicked wives. Now as such are the roots, such are the fruits: such as is the
cause, such likewise is the effect: so fares it with the wil-working wits of
these unkindly creatures, both wicked, because both women.

Emelia likewise boldly presuming upon the patience of her impatient husband,
sorting a time when for his melancholy recreation, he had severed himself into
a garden, whether he often resorted: where sitting him down under the broad
branches of a bleeding Mulberie, and supposing himself to be safe from
disturbing approach of misliking company, he taking in his heavy hands a sad
tuned instrument, unto whose tracet strains he solemnly sung this sad song.

Some Poets say there is a hill,
Where sittes the Ladies of delight,
Composed of Musicks sacred skill,
And teaches every man t'indight.
Thence does my mind return again,
For she can find no solemn muse,
Whose discontented tracet strain,
Will fit the Antheme she must use,
They sing of joy, and she of woe,
They of delight, she of unrest,
There let their merry Muses go.
Whom fairer days have better blessed,
A sad tuned hart's my instrument,
Whose strings all out of tune I strain,
Striking great dumps of discontent.
Till all be plucked in two with pain,
My Music is a sorrows song,
Where discords sound is smart delight,
My dittie, life that lastes too long,
To see desire crossed with despite,
Unpleasant harmony God knows,
When out of tune is every string,
Bad sounds that all of discord grows,
And sad the Muse that so must sing,
But some poor souls must merry make,
Whose else dead drooping cheer would die,
Least sorrow should asunder break,
There groaning souls with misery.
Which dittie after he had solemnly sung, and that the trickle tears stopped up
the pleasant passage of his sorrowful song, easily rising from melancholy seat,
gins with sad sigh to reiterate to himself the hard mishaps of his
malecontented life. When turning him back, and seeing his wife hasting toward
him, would fain have shunned her coming, as loath to be disturbed in his
discontent, but she entreating him staid his escape, and thus gins cunningly to
insinuate with his sorrow.

Husband (quoth thee) will thou still suffer this canker of discontent to eat
away in despair, the sweet Summer of thy chiefest days? Sorrow exceeding
cure, must also be past care. Hurts that cannot be avoided, must by means be
amended. Shall the patient let his sore fester, because he cannot abide the
surgeon should search it? And will thou die in despair, because thou suffrest
none to dissuade thee from this discontent? It is an old saying, Nothing is
nearer the tree then the bark: and should there be any thing more dear to a
man than his wife? Therefore was she taken out of his breast, because she
should be always in his bosom. Suffer me to unrip the sore, for I will be a
gentle surgeon, and being ransacked I will minister sovereign salve to mitigate
thy malady: why do thou then this in discontent, turn from me as weary of
my company? who has divorced thy liking from my love, or orawen thy desire
from my delight? Whereat the wearied king faintly answering his dissembling
wife gins thus mildely to answer: My woes (quoth he) more than the sands
upon the shoares, will hardly by counsel be qualified, though it were more then
the drops of water in the sea: the which despair of comfort drives me from
desiring counsel: but if thou can bring any balm that will expel this grief,
any salve that will search this sore, or any thing else that will work mine ease,
I will (for thy sake) hear it, though peradventure I shall not use it. Let me
(quoth she) see thy disease, and then shall thou hear my devise. That (quoth
he) can I in a word, though it be as much as a world, the discontented harm
of an over charged heart, having al things, and yet enjoying nothing, pleased
of al except my self, and by my self displeasing al but my self. Thus have I
shortly (quoth he) told thee my grief, though I despair, by thee to receive
any releef: why quoth she have so many years run over my woeful head, and
think thou I never tasted the sharp dealing of discontent: yes, thy self
can witness to my woe, with what grief I have ouergone the loss of our
chiefest comfort, so strangely taken away which patience did cure in me: but
greater helps have thou for remedy. Is not sour meat disgested with sweet
sauce? cold humors expelled with hot sweates? soft iron filed with hard
steel? and shall not discontentiue despair be dispersed with the sweet counsel
of contented comfort? lets guess (quoth she) at thy malladie, and then I will
give thee a sovereign remedy: loosly have thou let ouerslip the pleasures of
many fair days by thine own neglect. Air unmoved straightwaies corrupts:
and water that stands quickrly stinckes: keen edges not used wax dull: and
good qualities not exercised wax dead. Moathes eat the vnworne garment, and
grass confusedly ouergrowen the untrodden pauement: better had we want wit,
then not use it. The soldier that cowardly keeps fast his weapon when he
should use it against his enemy, were far better have none at al. How I
should compare thy state I know not, except to the miserable estate of a muddie
miser, that having much, will use naught. How great gifts has heaven and thy
forward endeavor endued thee withal? and since then, how little have thou
employed them? Oh there is a branch sprung from thine own root, that had he
but a small quantity of thy qualities, a modill of thy mind, would long ere
this have cured in himself that grief whereon thou now gronest, and long
since have pleased himself by plaguing thee: but that the just God considering
thy quiet contented disposition, that rather desire to suffer injury then to
challenge equity. He is a soldier forsooth: what then? but thou a scholar, a
thing far more in account among men. Did Ajax his big braues ouerbeare Ulysses
his wise words? No. And shall thy brothers furious looks ouerturne thy friendly
dealing? Thy displeasing despair is his delightsome content, and thy passion
his pleasure. Rowze then thy sleeping conceit, shake off the sad earthly
melancholy wight from thy light ayrie spirit, and boldly brave him, that so
basely ouerbeares thee. Happily thou think these words proceed fro some
envious intent forethought by me, but God, and all good men can witness with
me, how I loved and honored him and his. And therewithal sheading a few
womanish tears, which as bountifully fall from their eyes, as words
plentifully flow from their mouths, drew the moodie mind of this malecontented
king into such a laborinth of weary thoughts as had almost quite tired his
melancholy imagination, yet wisely repressing the furious rage of rigorous woes
would not in bitter terms exclaim, but rather determined with himself to
cover the fury of his choler with some show of patience, til time and
opportunity should minister some better occasion, to acquit his intended
injuries, as he then conceived by this persuasion of his perverse wife, and so
showing not withstanding some show of discontent: which not a little pleased
his wife, that she had yet some hope to separate their so sure joined
affections. And thus having ended their parlee, they both departed from thence,
and betook themselves to their private chambers.

How Emelia wife to Perseus wrought subtle means to set at ods the two
brethren, and what insued thereof, with the flight of both the dukes, and the
banishment of their wives. The eight Chapter.
EMelia in the mean time, albeit in some part her bloody thirst of warries was
quenched, yet not so fully satisfied as she earnestly desired, she often times
devised with herself how she might fully effect her long looked for intent, in
the end, privily packing with a servant of hers, whom to such an end she had
long reserved, and bounteouslie rewarded. One morning seeing her brother
Theseus taking the benefit of a private walk, whither he continually every
morning resorted, sent down unto him by her foresaid servant, desiring him as
he conceived any good opinion of her, and favored the welfare of himselfs,
that he would in all secret sort commit himself unto the trust of that her
servant, to be conveyed by him into her chamber, where she had very secret
affairs to impart unto him, such as near touched his credit and estate. This
credulous Prince attributing more affiaunce to his sister then provident
foresight would have permitted, gently condiscends to her cunning contrived
treason. The suspicion whereof was as far from his wel-meaning mind, as the
highest part of heaven from the lowest center of the earth. But as with fair
stales trustful birds are easiest taken: with bright baits the seely fish is
soon deceived: so with the fair flattery of a wicked disposed woman, this
fair prince was fowlie betrayed, to the dishonor of him, to the discredit of
her, and the utter subuerting of that steadfast established common wealth for
ever.

At last following the direction of a subtle slave poynted for the nonce to
betray this peerless Prince, he was innocently brought into a sudden snare.
For coming into her chamber, he found his sister in laws in her bed, a thing,
then which nothing was less looked for at his hands. Which when he saw, he
adventured to go nearer her, supposing her to have been sick, because the
day being somewhat spent, she was not yet got from her nightly resting place.
At whose coming she suddenly starting up, exclaimes with so loud a voice, as
that she was easily heard to the furthest places of the palace. To whom
incontinent flocks a number of diligent attendants, to understand the cause of
her so sudden cry, to whom she feines a forged tale, how her brother, and
their king had boldly adventured to approach the entrance of her Chamber, and
violently assayed to have ravished her in her bed, for which cause she was
constrained to use the means of her tongue, for that the weak force of her
womanish hand, was scarce able to defend his fierce assault. To witness
whereof she calls the false treacherous villain, whom before she had made a
mean to draw him thither. He as subtle as the dissembling Greekish slave,
that enticed the trustful Trojans to their cruel end, thus tells a substantial
discourse, how the king entering the chamber, offered such violence unto his
sister. And then with much counterfeit action, he begins to show the manner of
his behavior.

By this time had the report of these unwelcome news come to his brothers
ears, who hastening to the place where all this assembly were gathered
together: where when he came, he found his wife with blubbered cheeks, and
loose dishouelled hair reiterating her former feined tale, and her hired slave
vilelie affirming the same with many deep oaths, the truth of this
truthlesse treachery, which so incensed his furious mind, as he looking upon
his innocent brother, gins thus bitterly break the sure linked chain of true
brotherly love, which they both till that time had so mightily maintained.

Ah (quoth he) have thou so soon forgotten the good precepts of our dying
father, whose straight charge might have even (as it were) chayned thee from
this foul offense of sensual finne, but the just heavens seeing into the
secret corners of thy dissembling heart, wherein was nothing but deceitful
double dealing, have for thy more then sinful hypocrisy, rewarded thee with
the just punishment of double iniquity, from whom I here before God, and all
these our servants and subjects, disioyne my self, vowing hereafter to be so
far from gracing thee with the friendly name of brother, as that I mean to
prosecute thee with the deadly hate of an enemy, and so I leave thee, that
never means in courtesy again to resalute thee.

When as Theseus, about for to reply in his own defense, was interrupted by
the confused noise of the murmuring people, by whose whole assent he was
generally condemned, as the wicked worker of this villainous practice, who
standing as it were in a swoone to see this unexpected exigent would have
spoken in his own defense, but being interrupted by the means of some of his
enemies confederates, he was forced in silence to depart, who coming down to
his wife, and declaring the whole truth of this treachery, and taking the
advantage of the time, least that delay might again reconcile them, following
on the angry disposition of her husband, for to levy speedy arms, both for
the better fortifying of himself against his brothers fury, as also if in
time he took the matter in hand, he should gather together the chiefest and
best part of the country, whose counsel he with all speed followed.

But his expedition in gathering forces together, was not so great as his
brothers was sudden, so that in few days, betwixt them they had equally
divided both the men and munition, of that their now unfortunate country. And
forceably assailing one another, prodigally consumed the precious blood of
their own countrymen, who were not so blessed before in their peaceful reign,
as they are cursed now in their untimely rage. Which the grave Senators of
that almost dispeopled Country, diligently foreseeing, made of themselves such
means to levy men, and provide munition, as the remnant of their already
gathered forces would afford. Intending either to make some accord betwixt
them again, or else to subvert them both, whose furies were so fierce, that
there was almost no hope of any reconciliation left betwixt them. Which when
they had done, before they would with open alarm proclaim the uncivil sort
of their coming, they sent to them many interchaungeable Heralds, to certify
them of the urging occasions of their gathered forces, which was in the dutiful
defense of their Country, to save as much as in them lay, all, or the most of
that their natural blood, which was like in these civil tempests of homebred
storms to be pitifully spilt. But such was the incensed fury of these two
unkindly foes, as that neither the love of their Country, the threats of
their foes, nor the intreates of their friends, could refrain them from their
resolution of revenge. So that the Country men who were there gathered
together, thought it the best course, both for the safety of themselves, and
the after quiet of their Country, to join battle with both at once, being
more in number then both the kings battles, which determination they
effectually followed. And al confusedly without form rushing together, joined
their disordred battles, where some laboring for ye good of their Country,
other for the hateful hope of bloody revenge, til in the end, the battles of
the kings, by reason of their confusion and disorder, were so impouerished,
that for fear of further danger they were both forced to fly.

After the end of which bloody battle, the Senators gathering together the
bodies of their dead Countrymen, as was their duty, afforded them honorable
burial. And then having rid, as they well hoped, their quiet Country of those
civil dissentions, they again betook themselves to their former several
businesses. Where we must now a while leave them to their own government til
time and their happy stars shall again reduce into the civil form of a
peaceable kingdom.

Old Radulpho after his happy reign in his quiet grave: Adrianus in the Lions
den: Berea amongst the savage Bandettes at the sea side: Perseus after the
slaughter of his men fled for succor to the mountains: Theseus escaping toward
the plain forest, as intending to depart his Country: and their wives by the
just censure of the new judging Senate, banished, to find out the several
husbands. Whom we must leave to their better fortunes, til time and our idle
hours shall again bring them al to their former estate.

FINIS.
