Of actyf life. and the works thereof / Caplm ii
THou shalt understood that there is in holy church two manner of lives as
saint gregory says. in the which christian men should be sauf / That one is
called actyf. Greg.
and ye other conte^platyff / without one of thise ii. no man may be sauid
Actyff life lies in love and charity showed outward by good bodily works in
fulfillyng of goddis commandments / and of the vii. works of mercy bodily
and ghostly to a man^es even christian This life longs to all worldly men which
have richesse and plenty of worldly goods for to spend / And so to all other
the which have state office or cure of other men. And have goods for to
spend. lerid and lewd: temporell or spirytuell / And generally all worldly
men are bound to fulfylle it after her might and cu^nyng: as reason and
discreco^n asks / If he much good have / much good for to do / If he
lityll have. less may he do / And if he nout have / then^e must he have a
good will Thise ben works of actyf life other bodily or ghostly / Also a great
part of actyf life lies in great bodily deeds. the which a man does to
himself / as great fasting: much wakyng / and other sharp penance dooyng for
to chastise the flesh with descreco^n for trespace before done / And by such
penance for to refrain lusts and likings of it / and to make him buxum and
ready to the will of the spirit / Thise works though they be^ actiff. they
help right much. and ordeneth a man in the begi^nyng to come to co^te^platyf
life / if they be^ used with descrecio^

Of conte^platiff life and the works thereof / Caplm iii.
COnte^platyf life lies in perfyte love and charity felyd inwardly by ghostly
virtues and by sothfast knowing and sight of god and ghostly things / This life
longs to hem specyalli the which for the love of god forsakith all worldly
richesse warshippes: and outward besines / and holy yeue^ hem body and soul
after her might and cu^nyng to the seruise of god by ghostly ocupaco^n / Now
then^e since it is so that thy state askith for to be conte^platiff / for that
is the^tent of thy enclosing. that thou myt more freely and enteerly give y^ to
gostly ocupaco^n / Then^e behouyth the for to be right besie both night and
day with traueyle of body and of spirit: for to come to that life as nygh as
thou may by such means as thou hopest were best to the. Nevertheless before
that I tell the of the means: I shall tell the first a lityll more of this
life conte^platyff: that thou myt somewhat see what it is / and sithen set it as
a mark in the sight of thy soul: whereto thou shall draw in all thyn
occupaco^n /

Of the first part of conte^placo^n / Caplm iiii^
COntemplatyff life has three parts / The first lies in knowing of god and
ghostly things geten by reason: by techyng of man: and by study in holy
writ / without ghostly affecco^n and July savor felyd. by the special yefte
of the holy ghost / This part have specially lettred men and great clerks
which by long study and trauaylle in holy writ comen to this knowing more
or less after the subtilte of kyndly wit and contynuau^ce of study. of the
general wit that god yeueth to every man that has use of reason / This
knowing is good / and it may be called a part of conte^placo^n. in asmoche as
it is a sight of sothfastnes. and a knowing of ghostly things Nevertheless it
is but a figure and a shawwe of very conte^placo^n / for it has not ghostly
savor in god: ne inwardly swetnes / the which no man may feel but if he be
in great charity / For it is the proper well of our lord / to the which
comes none alien. But this manner knowing is common to good and badde / for it
may be had without charity: and therefore it is not very conte^placo^n / As often
sithes ypocrytes and flesshly living men have more such knowing than many
other christian men. and yet have thise men no charity. Of this manner knowing
spekith saint poul thus / Si habuero oe^m sciencia^. and no uerim misteria
oi^a. caritate^ aute^ non habea^. nihil su^. Cor i3.
If I had full knowing of all thynges^ and I knew al preuytees. and I had not
charity. I am rit naught / Nevertheless if they that have this knowing keep hem
in mekenes and in charity: and flee worldly and flesshly sins after her
might; it is to hem a good way and a great disposing to very conte^placio^ / if
they desire and may devoutly after the grace of ye holy ghost / Other me^ that
have this cu^nyng and turns it to pride and vaynglory of he^self / or in to
couetyse and desiryng of worldly states. Greg.
worships and riches / not mekely taking it to the praising of god: ne
charitably spe^deth it in the profit of her eue^cristen. some of hem fallen
other into heresies and errors / or in to other open sins / by the which
they sclau^der he^self and all holy church / Of this cu^nyng says saint poul
thus. Scie^cia inflat. caritas ante^ edificat / knowi^g alone lifts up the
heart into pride / but me^ge it with charity: and then^e turns it into
edifycaco^n / This knowing alone is but water unsavory and cold / And therefore
if they that have it would mekely offer it up to our lord / and pray him of
grace / he should with his blessyng turn the water in to wine / as he did at
ye prayer of his mother at the fest of Architriclyne / that is for to say / He
should turn the unsavory knowing in to wisdom. and the cold naked reason in to
ghostly light and bre^nyng love by the yefte of the holy ghost /

Of the ii. part of contemplaco^n / Caplm v.
THe ii. part of conte^placo^n lies pryncipally in affeccion without light of
vndersto^ding of ghostly things / and this is comynly of simple and unlettered
men / which yeue^ hem holy to deuoco^n / and this is felyd on this manner /
when man or woman in meditaco^n of god by the grace of the holy ghost felyth
fervor of love and ghostly swetnes by the mind of cryst^ passo^n / or any of
his works in his ma^hede / or he felith a great trust in the goodness and in
the mercy of god f^^ the foryeuenes of his sins: and for his great yeft of
grace. (...) else he felith a dread in his affecco^n with great reverence of the
preuy ^omes of god / the which he sees not / and of his rightwylnes. Or in
prayer he felith the thout of his heart draw up fro all all erthly things.
strenyd togider with all the myghtes of his heart: vpstyeng to our lord by
fervent desire and with ghostly delight And nevertheless in that time he has no
open sight in vndsto^dyng of ghostly thynges^ ne of preuytees of holy writ in
special / but only that him thynkith for the time no thing likyth him
somoche as for to pray or think as he does. for savor delight and comfort
that he fyndeth therein / And yet can he not tell what it is. but he felyth it
well: for it is a yeft of god For out of it spryngen many swete^ teres: bre^nyng
desires / and stylle mournynges^ which scoureth and cle^seth the heart fro all
ye fylth of syn^e / and makes it melte in to wonderful swetnes of Ihu^ christ.
buxum. soople: and ready to fulfylle al goddis will / In somoche that him
thynkith he makith no charge what comyth of himself / so that goddis will
were fulfilled with such many stirynges moo than I can or may say / This
felyng may not be had without great grace / and who so has it for the time he
is in charity / which charity may not be lost ne lessed though the fervor of
it pass away: but by a dedely sin^e / and that is comfortable: This may be
called the ii. part of co^templaco^n / Nevertheless this part has ii. degrees /

Of the lower degree of the ii^ part of conte^placo^n / ca vi:
THe lower degree of this feeling. men which are actyff may have by grace wha^
they be^ visyted of our lord as myghtly and as ferue^tly as they that give hem
holy to conte^platyf life and has this yeft. but this felyng in his fervor
comith not always wha^ a man would. ne it lastith not full long. It comyth and
gooth as he will that yeuyth it / and therefore who so has it. meke himself.
and thank god: and keep it preuy / but if it be to his confessor / and hold
he it aslong as he may with descreco^n / And wha^ it is wythdrawen dread not
tomoche. but stand sadly in faith and in a meke hope / with pacye^ce abidyng
till it come again / This is a lityl tastyng of the swetnes of ye love of god /
of the which david says thus in the sawter / P^ xxxiii
Gustate and videte qm^ suauis est dn^s / Taast ye and see ye the swetnes of
our lord /

Of the hyer degree of the ii. part of co^templaco^n / Caplm vii.
THe hyer degree of this part may not be had and holden but of hem the which
be^ in great rest of body and soul / the which by grace of Ihu^ and long
traueile bodily and ghostly felith a rest of heart and clen^es in conscience.
so y^ hem liken no thing somoche for to do / as to sit stylle in rest of
body / and for to always pray to god. and think on our lord. and to think
sometime on the blessid name of Ihesu which is comfortable and delectable to
hem / that by the mind of it they felen hem fed in her affecco^n / And not
only of y^ name. but al other manner prayers: as the Pater nost and the Auee /
or ympnes or psalms and other devout saye^ges of holy church are turned as it
were in to a ghostly mirth and sweet so^ge ^ by y^ which they are comforted
and stre^gthed against al sins. and much releuyd of bodily disese. Of this
degree spekith saint poul thus ^olite inebriari vino: Eph^e. v.
sed i^pleamin^ sp^u sco^. loquentes vobis metip^is in ympnis and canticis and
psalmis spu^alibus. canta^tes and psalle^tes in cordibus vr^is dn^o / Be ye not
dro^ken with wine / but be ye fulfilled of ye holy ghost saie^g to yourself in
ympnes and psalms and ghostly so^ges: synging and psalmyng in your hertes to
our lord / who so has this grace keep he himself in lowenes / and that he be
ever desiryng for to come to more knowing and felyng of god in the third part
of co^templaco^n /

Of the third part of contemplacion / Caplm viii.
THe third part of conte^placion the which is perfect as it may here lies
both in cognico^n and in affecco^n. That is to say / in knowing and in perfect
loving of god. And that is wha^ a ma^nys soul first is reformed by fulhede of
virtues to the image of Ihu^ / And afterward wha^ he is visited he is taken in
fro all erthly and flesshly affecco^ns: fro vayn thought and ymaginynges of all
bodily creatures / and as it were much rauysshed out of the bodily wits /
And then^e by ye grace of the holy ghost is illumyned for to see by vndsto^dyng
soth fastnes which is god and ghostly things with a soft sweet bre^nyng love
in him so perfitly that he be rauysshed of his love. so the soul is onyd for
the time and co^formyd to the image of ye trinite / The begyn^yng of this
conte^placo^n may be felid in this life / but the fulhede of it is kept into the
bliss of heaven Of this onyng and conformyng to our lord spekith saint poul
thus / Qui adheet deo. vnus sp^s ^ cu^ illo / That is to say / who so by
rauysshi^g of love is fastened to god: then^e god and his soul are not two.
but both one / And sothly in this onyng is ye marriage made betwix god and the
soul: the which shall never be broken /

Of the twyn^ing of the iii. part of conte^placo^n. fro the ii. part of the
praising thereof / Caplm ix
THe other part may be callid bren^yng love in deuoco^n / and this bre^nyng
love in conte^placion. yt is lower. this is ye hier. that is swetter to the
bodily feling / this inwardly felyng better to the ghostly felyng. For it is
more inward. more wothy: more ghostly: more wondful / For this is verily a
tasting so lityl as is and a ernest of the sight of heavenly joy: not clerli.
but half in derkenes. the which shall be fulfilled and openly clered in the
bliss of heaven: as saint poul says / Videmus nu^c per spclm i^ enigmate. i^
cor^ i3.
tu^c aute^ videbimus facie ad facie^ / we see now god by a myrrour as it were
in a derknes / but in heaven shall we see openly face to face. This is the
illumynaco^n of vndstondyng in delites of loving as david says in the sawter.
Psalm^^ C. xviii
Et nox illu^i naro^ mea in deliciis meis / (...) night is my light in my
delyt^ The Other part is milk for children / this is hole mete for perfyte men:
the which have wits assayd to know good fro evil: as saint poul says /
Pfectorum e^ solidus ribus. Hebr^ v.
q he^nt se^sus exercitatos ad discre^o^em boni and mali / The werkynge of the
full use of this yefte may no man have but he be first reformed to ye lyknes of
Ihu^ by fulhede of virtues / Ne there may no man living in dedely flesh have
it co^tynuelly in his fulhede and in the ouerpassyng: but by times when he
(...) iiii is visited / And as I co^ceyue by the writing of holy men it is a
full short time. for soon after he falls in a sobirte of bodily feeling / and
all this work makith charity / Thus as I vndstonde says saint poul of himself
Sieve excedimus deo. sieve sobrii sumus vobis. caritas xp^i vrget nos / wherther
we ouerpasse our bodily wits to god in conte^placo^n. or we are more sobir
to you in bodily felyng. ye charity of crist streyneth us. Of this part of
co^te^placo^n and of reforming to god spekith saint poul openly thus / Nos
aute^ reuelata facie gliam dn^i speclam^ tra^sformati in eande^ ymagine^ a
claritate i^ claritate^^ ta^quamm a dn^i sp^u And this is thus much for to say
Saint poul in the person of himself and of perfyte men says thus / we first
reformed by virtues. the face of our soul vnhelid by openyng of the ghostli
eye beholden as in a myrrour heavenly joy. fulshapid and ouyd to thymage of our
lord fro clerete of faith into clerete of vndstondyng / or else fro clerete of
desire in to clerete of blessed love / and all this is wrout of the spirit of
our lord in a mannis soul as saint poul says: This part of co^te^placo^n god
yeuyth where yt he will / to leryd and to lewd: to men and to wym^en ocupied
in prelacye: and to solitary also / But it is special not common / and also
though a man which al his life is actyf have the yeft of it by a special grace
/ nevertheless the fulness of it may no man have but he be solitary and in life
conte^platyf /

How the showing to the bodily wyittes and the feeling of hem may be both good
and evil / Caplm.x.
By this that I have said may you so^what vndsto^de that visyo^s or reuelaco^ns
of any manner of spirit in bodily aperyng. or in ymaginynge slepyng or wakyng /
or else any other felyng in y^ bodily with made as it were ghostly. other in
sownyng of ere: or sauering in the mouth: or smellyng at ye nose: or else any
se^sible hete as it were fire glowyng and warmyng ye breast or any other part
of ye body / or any other thing yt may be felyd by bodily wit though it be
never so comfortable and lykyng / they ben not very conte^placo^n / ne they
^en but simple and secu^dary though they ben good in reward of ghostly virtues
and of this ghostly knowing and loving of god / But al such manner of felyng
may be good / wrought by a good angel / and they may be deceyuable / wrought
by a wicked angel. when he tra^sfygurith him in to an angel of light / wherefore
sith they may be both good and evil it semith well they are not the best. For
wit you well that the devil may wha^ he has leave feyne in bodily felyng the
lykenes of the same things the which a good angel may work / For right as a
good angel comyth with light: so can ye devil / And so of the other wits /
who so had felid both / he should well tell which were good and which were
evil / But he that never felid neither: or else but that one: may lightly be
deceived / They are like in the manner of felyng outward: but they are full
diverse within / And therefore they are not for to desire greatly. ne for to
receive lightly / but if a soul might by the spirit of discreco^n know the
good fro the evil that he were not begyled / as saint Ioh^n says / Nolite
credere om^isp^ui. sed probare si ex deo sit / Saint Ioh^n bids us that we
should not trust to every spirit / but we shall assaye first whether he be of
god or no / wherefore by one assaye I shall tell the as me thynkith how thou
shall know the good fro evil

How you shall know wha^ the showing to the bodily wyyttes and felyng of hem ben
good or evil / Caplm xi.
IF it so be that thou see any manner of light or bryghtnes with thy bodily eye
/ or in ymaginynge other than every man see / or if thou here any merry wondful
so wnyng with thy bodily ere. or in thy mouth any sweet soden savor other than
of kind. or any hete in thy breast. as it were fire. or any manner delight in any
part of thy body / or if a spirit bodily aperith unto y^ as it were an angel
for to comfort the. and teache y^. or any such felyng which you know well yt
it comith not of thyself ne of no bodily creature / beware in yt time or so ne
after. and wisely behold ye stiryng of thy heart: If you be stirred because of
y^ likyng that you felist to draw out thy heart fro ye mi^de and the beholding of
Ihesu christ and fro ghostly ocupaco^n: As fro prayer and thynkyng of thiself
and thy defaw^es / fro thi^warde desire of virtues and of ghostly knowing and
felyng of god / For to set the sight of thy heart and thy affecco^n / thy delight
and thy rest pryncipally therein / wenyng y^ it should be a part of heavenly joy
and of angels bliss / and for thy the thynkith that you sholdest another pray ne
think not else but al holy tente thereto for to keep it and delight the therein /
This felyng is suspect and of the^mye / and therefore though it be never so
liking and wondful. refuse it and asse^t not thereto / for this is the sleyght
of the^mye. wha^ he sees a soul that would inteerly give it to ghostly
ocupaco^n: he is wondly wroth / For he hates no thing more then^e for to see a
soul in a body of syn^e to feel verily the savor of ghostly knowing and the
love of god. ye which he without body of syn^e lost wylfully / And therefore if
he may not let him by open sins. he would hynd him and begile him by such
vanyte of bodily savors: or swetnes in the wits for to bring a soul in to
ghostly pride and in to a falls sikernes of himself / weninge yt he had thereby a
felyng of heavenly Joy: and that he were half in paradyse for delight that he
felyth about him: wha^ he is nere at hell yates / And so by pride and by
presu^pco^n he might fall in errors or heresies or fa^tasies. or in other
bodily or ghostly myscheues / Nevertheless if it be so that this manner of felyng
let not thy heart fro ghostly ocupaco^n / but it makith the more devout and
more fervent for to pray / it makith the more wise for to think ghostly
thoughts / And though it be so that it astonye the in the begyn^yng /
nevertheless afterward it turns and quyckeneth thyn heart to more desire of
virtues / and increases thy love more to god and to thyn euencrysten / Also it
makith the more meke in thyn own sight / By these tokens may thou know that
it is of god made by the presence and the touching of a good angel / and that
is of the goodness of god either in comfort of simple devout souls for to
increase her trust and her desire to god for to seek thereby the knowing ye
love of god more perfytly for such a comfort / or else if they be^ perfyte that
fele^ such delight: it semyth then^e that it is an ernest and as it were a
shadow of ye glorifyeng of the body which it shall have in ye bliss of heaven.
I wot not whether there be any such man living in earth / This preuylege had
mary mawdeleyne as it semith to my sight in y^ time wha^ she was alone in ye
cave xxx. winter / and every day was borne up with angels and was fed both bodi
and soul by ye presence of hem: thus we read in ye story of her / Of this
manner assaye^g of werkyng of spyrites spekith saint Ioh^n in his pistle thus.
and techeth thus / Oi^s sp^s q soluit ih^m. hic no^ e^ ex deo. Every spirit ye
loses or vnknyttith Ihu^. he is not of god / Thise words may be vndsto^de in
many manners / Nevertheless after one manner I may vndsto^de hem to this purpose
yt I have said.

what knytteth Ihu^ to man's soul: and what loses him therfro / Ca xii.
THe knyttyng and ye fastenyng of Ihu^ to a man's soul: is by good will and
great desire to him only for to have him and see him in his bliss ghostly /
The more yt this desire is. the faster is Ihu^ knytte to the soul: The less
that this desire is ye loslyer is he knitte: Then what spirit or what feling
yt it be the which lesseth this desire and would draw it down fro ye steadfast
mind of Ihu^ christ. and fro ye kyndly styeng up to Ihu^ / this spirit will
vnknytte ihu^ fro ye soul: and therefore it is not of god: but it is the
werkyng of the^mye / Nevertheless if a spirit or a felyng or a reuelaco^n make
this desire more. knytte the knottes of love and deuoco^n to ihu^ faster: and
open the eye of ye soul in to ghostly knowing more clerly: and makith it more
meke in it self this spirit is of god / Here may you see so^what that you shall
not suffer thy heart wilfully for to rest ne for to delight holy in no bodily
felyng of such manner co^fortes or swetnes thou they were good. but you shall
hold hem in thy sight naught or lityl in reward of ghostly desire and on
stedfaff thynking on ihu^ / ne fest the thought of thy heart ouermoche on he^

How and in what things should a conte^platyf man be ocupied / Caplm xiii.
But thou shall ever seek by great besynes in prayers that thou might come to
the ghostly felyng of god / And that is that you might know the wisdom of god
/ the endless might of him / the great goodness of him in himself and in his
creatures / For this is conte^placo^n / and that other is none. thus says
saint poul / In caritate radicati and fu^dati. Eph^^ iii.
vt possitis co^prehendere cu^ oi^bus sci^s que sit longitu do and latitudo.
sublimitas and profundu^ / Be ye roted and grounded in charity that ye might
know he says neither sou^de of the ere ne sweet savor in the mouth: ne none
such bodily thing. but that ye might know and feel with all halowes which
is the length of the endless being of god / the bread of the wonderful charity
and the goodness of god / the heyth of the almighty mageste of him. and the
grou^dles depnes of the wisdom of god In knowing and ghostly felyng of thise
should be the ocupaco^n of a conte^platyff man / For in thise may be understood
the full knowing of al ghostly things / This ocupaco^n is that one thing: the
which saint poul coueyted saye^g thus / Vnu^ que retro su^t obliuisce^s. in
anteriora me extenda^. sequor si quo mo do comp^henda^ supernum braniu^ / Thus
much is to say / ^o thing. Phil. iii
as hoo says. is best to me for to coueyte / and that is that I might fogete
all things the which ben behyndwarde or backewarde / and I shall stretche out
mine heart ever forward for to feel and to grype the souereyne mede of the
endeles bliss / Hynwarde are all bodily things / Forward are goostly things
/ And for saint poul would forgete all bodily things: and his own bodi also.
with that y^ he might see ghostly things /

How in reason and will virtue begins. and in love and in likyng it is made
perfyte / Caplm xiiii.
NOw I have told you a lityll of co^templaco^n what it should be: For this
intent that thou might know it and set it as a mark before the syghte of
thy soul / and for to desire all thy life time to come to any part of it by ^
grace of our lord Ihu^ christ / This is the conformyng of a soul to god / the
which may not be had but if it be first reformyd by fulhede of virtues
turned in to affecco^n. and that is wha^ a man loves virtues / for they be^
good in he^self / There is many a man that has virtue of lownes. patience and
charity to his eue^crysten. and such other only in his reason and will / and
has no ghostly delight ne love in hem / For oftymes he felith grutchinge.
heaviness and bitterness for to do hem / and nevertheless yet he does hem only by
stiryng of reason for dread of god / this man has virtues in reason and in will
/ but not love of he^ in his affeccyo^ But wha^ by grace of Ihu^ and by ghostly
and bodily exercise reason is turned in to light: and will in to love. then^e
has he virtues in affecco^n / For he has so well gnawe on the bitter bark of
the notte that he has broken it: and fedeth him with ye kyrnell / yt is to say
/ The virtues which were first heavy for to do: are now turned into a very
delight and savor: as wha^ a man likes in mekenes: in patience: in cle^nes: in
sobyrte: and in charity. as in any delytes / ^othly till thise virtues ben
turned thus in to affeccio^. he may well have the ii. part of conte^placo^n /
but the iii sothfastly shall he not take /

Of the means that brings a soul to conte^placio^. Caplm xv:
NOw sithe^ virtues are disposyng to conte^placo^n. then^e it behouith ye use
certain means for to come to virtues Three means there be^ which men most
comynly vsen y^ yeuen he^ to conte^placo^n / As redyng of holy writ and of
holy teching: ghostly meditacio^: and besie prayer with deuoco^n: By meditaco^n
shall thou see as I said thy wretchidnes / thy sins. and thy wyckidnes / As
pride: couetise: gloteny: sloth: and lecherye wicked stirynges of envy / ire:
hatred. and male^colye: angrines: bitterness: and unskillful heaviness / Thou
shalt also see thy heart full of vain shames and dredes of thy flesh and of
the world / All these stirynges wyllen all way boylle out of thy heart a
water will ren^e out of ye spring of a stinki^g well. and let y^ site of thy
soul that you may never see ne feel clearly ye love of Ihu^ christ. For wite
you well till thy heart be much cle^sid thru stable troth and besie beholdi^g of
christ ma^hede fro such sins. you may not have ghostly knowing of god perfytly
witnessyng himself in the gospel thus. Bti^ mu^do cord qm^ ip^i de u^
videbu^t. Math^ v.
Blessid be clean of heart. for they shall see god. Also in meditacion you shall
see virtues which be nedful to y^ for to have. as mekenes: myldnes: patience.
ritwisnes: gostly strength te^perau^ce: cle^nes: pees: and sobernes: faith:
hope: and charity / These virtues you shall see in meditacio^. how good how fair
how profitable they be^ / and by prayer you shall desire hem and get hem.
without wiche you may not be conte^platif. For Job says thus. Inhabu^da^cia
igredieris sepulcru^. Job. v.
That is to say. you shall in^ple^te of good bodily werkis and gostly virtues
enter thy grave. yt is the rest in conte^placo^n /

What a man should use and refuse by ye virtue of mekenes / Caplm xvi*
NOw if thou sholdest use wisely gostly works and sikerly traueyle in he^. the
behouyth to begyn^e rit low / Three things ye needs to have first. upon yt
which as on a siker ground thou shall set al thy work. thise iii. are
mekenes: siker faith. and hole intent to god / First the behouyth to have
mekenes in this manner / you shall hold thyselfe in thy will and in thy felyng
if thou may unable to dwell among me^. and unworthy to serve god in
co^uersaco^n with his servant unprofitable to thy eue^cristen: wa^tyng both
cu^nyng and myt to fulfill good works of actif life in help of thy
euencristen: as other men and wym^en done. And therefore as a wretch and
outcaste: and refuse of all men and wym^en art sperred in a house alone / yt you
sholdest dear ne grieve no man or woman by evil ensample. sith thou can not
profit he^ by good werkyng / ^uer this y^ behouith to look feder y^ s^^h you
art so unable to serve our lord by bodily works outward. Tren^. iiii.
how much more behouyth y^ to hold y^ unable and unworthy to serve him
ghostly by inward ocupaco^n / For our lord is a spirit as the prophet says.
Sp^s ante facie^ nr^am xp^s dn^s / Before our face a ghost is our lord christ /
and the kyndly seruyse to him is ghostly / as he says himself. Very adorantes
adorabu^t pre^m in sp^u and veritate / Sothfast servants shall worship him in
spirit and sothfastnesse / Then you that art so boystous. so lewd: so
flesshli: John. iiii.
so blind in goostly things / and namly of thyn own soul: which the
behouyth first to know if thou sholdest come to the knowing of god / How
sholdest thou then feel thyself able or worthy for to have state or lyknes of
conte^platyf life / the which life as I have said lies pryncipally in ghostly
knowing: and felinge of god. This I say to the: not that you sholdest forthynke
thy purpose. and be mispaid with thy enclosyng. but yt thou sholdest feel this
lowenes sothfastly in thy heart if thou might / for it is soth and no lees / And
then^e you shall desire night and day after thy might for to come as nere as thou
may to yt state which you have take / trowyng steadfastly that it is best to
the by the mercy of god. for to traueyle in / And though it be so that thou
may not come to the fulhede of it here in this life. that you mit be in the
begyn^yng of it. and trust sikerly for to have the fulhede by the mercy of god
in the bliss of heaven / For sothly that is my life / I feel me so wretchyd and
so freyle and flesshly / and so fer^ fro true felyng fro that ye I speak: that
I can not ellis but cry mercy. and desire after as I may with an hope y^ our
lord will bring me thereto in the bliss of heaven / Do thou so. and beter
after that god yeuyth the grace / The felyng of this lownes shall put out of
thyn heart vnskylful beholding of other men^es deeds / and it shall drive the
holy to behold thyselfe / as there were no man living but god and thou / And
thou shall deem and hold thyself more vile and more wretch tha^ is any
creature yt beryth life. that uneath shall you suffer thiself for the gretnes and
no^bre of syn^e and fylthe that thou shall feel in the / Thus behouyth the for
to feel sometime if thou will be very meke For I tell the sothly. if thou wylt
be truly meke thou shall think a venyal syn^e in thiself more grievous and
painful to y^ and greter be in thy sight sometime. than great dedely sins of
other men / This is soth to the if thou will be contemplatife. for this skyll /
That thing the which puttith thy soul or lettith it most fro the felyng and
knowing of god: owes to be most grievous and paynfull to the / But a venyall
sin of thiself lettith the more fro the felyng and perfyte love of Ihesu
christ than any other man^es syn^e may do: be it never somoche Semyth it then^e
that thou should more arise in thyn own heart against thyself for to hate and
deem in thyself all manner of si^ne which lets the fro the sight of god /
more than against the defawtes of other men / For if thyn heart be clean of thyn
own sins / sothly the sins of all other me^ should not dear y^ and therefore
if thou will find rest here and in the bliss of heaven / after the counsel
of one of the holy faders say every day what am I / and deem thou no man /

who should blame men^es defawtes and deem hem. and who not / Caplm xvii.
But now see thou how may this be. since it is a deed of charity for to blame
men of her defawtes / and for to deem hem far her amendyng it is a deed of
mercy / As to this I answer as me thynkith / yt to the or to any other the
which has stat^ and purpoos of life co^templatyf it fallyth not for to leave
the keeping of hemself / and for to behold and to blame other men of her
defawtes / but if it were full great need / so that a man should peryssh^ but if
thou blamyd him / But the men which are actyf^ and have soueraynte and cure
over other as prelates and curates and such other: they are bound by their
office and by way of charity for to see and seek. and deem rightfully other
men^es defawtes / Not of desire and delight for to chastise he^. but oonly for
need with dread of god and in his name. for love of saluaco^n of her souls /
Other me^ that are actyf and have no cure of other men. they are bound for to
blame other men of her defawtes by the way of charity only that when the syn^e
is dedely / and it may not well be corrected by none other man and when he
trowyth that he the sooner should be amended by his vndtakyng / Else it is beter
that he cesse. That this is soth it semyth by saint Ioh^n which held the
state of conte^platyf life. and saint peter which had the state of acty^ life.
wha^ our lord in his last sowper with his discyples at the preuy stirynge of
saint peter to saint Ioh^n told saint Ioh^n how Judas should bitraye him /
saint Ioh^n told it not to saint peter as he askid / but he turned him and
laid his head upon cristis breast. and was rauysshid by love in to
conte^placo^n of goddis priuitees And so medefully to him / that he forgate
both Judas and saint peter / in tokenyng and techyng to other men which would
be conte^platyf. that they should dispose hem for to do the same.

Why men should worship other and low he^self in her own heart vnd al other /
Caplm xviii.
THen^e see thou here somewhat that thou shall another deem other men / ne
conceive against hem wylfully none evil suspico^n / but thou shall love hem /
ne see thou no defawte in hem / and worship hem in thy heart such as ledeth in
ye world actyf life / and suffren many trybulaco^ns and te^ptacyons which thou
sittyng in thy house felyst naught of / And they have full much traueyle and
disese for her own and other men^es sustynau^ce / and many of hem had well
lever serve god if they might as thou do in bodily rest / And nevertheless
they in her worldly besynes flee many sins / the which if thou were in her
state thou sholdest fall in / and they do many good deeds which thou cowde
not do / It is no doubt that mani done thus. which they ben. thou wost not
/ And therefore thou shall worship al. and set hem in thy heart al above the as
thy souereyns / and cast the down vnd her fete that thou be vylest and lowest
in thin own sight: for it is no dread ne no peril to the how much thou may
low thyself bynethe al other. though it were so that in goddis sight thou
had more grace than any other. But it is peril to the to hye the and lift
thiself in thy thought wylfully above any other man / though he were the most
wretch: or the most synful caytiff that is in earth / For our lord sayth^
Luc^ xiiii
Qui se huliat exaltabit. et qui se exaltat huliabit / who so hieth himself. he
shall be lowed. and who so lowyth hymself^ he shall be hyed / This part of mekenes
y^ behouyth for to have in thy begyn^yng / and by this and by grace shall thou
come to the fulhede of it and so of all other virtues For who so has one
virtue. he has al other virtues. Asmoche as thou have of mekenes. somoche have
thou of charity. of pacyence. and of other virtues though they ben not showed
outward / Be then^e besie to get mekenes: and hold it for it is ye first
and the last of all virtues / It is the first: for it is the ground as saint
austyn says / If thou think for to bilde an hye house of virtues / ordeyne
the first a deep ground of mekenes. Also it is the last / for it is keeping and
saving of all other virtues / saint gregory says / He that gadreth virtues
without mekenes. he is like to him the which makith and beryth powder of
spicery in the wind / Do thou never so many good deeds / fast thou: wake
thou. or any other good work do thou / if you have no mekenes / it is naught
that thou do /

How men should do that wanten the felyng of mekenes in affecco^n not dredyng
tomoche therefore / Caplm xix.
Nevertheless if thou may not feel this mekenes in thyn heart with affection as
thou would do as thou may meke thyself in will by reason / trowyng that it
should be so as I say / though thou feel it not / And in that hold the a more
wretch that thou may not feel sothfastly thyself as thou art / And if you do
so. though thy flesh rise there again. and will not assent to thy good will.
be not tomoche adrad. but you* shall bear and suffer the false felyng of thy
flessh^ as a pain / and then^e thou shall despise and repreue that feeling.
and break down that risyng of thyn heart: as thou would be well paid for to be
trodden and spourned vnd other me^nes fete. And so by the grace of Ihu^ christ
through steadfast thinkyng on the mekenes of his precious ma^hede shall thou
much abate the stirynges of pride / And the virtue of mekenes yt was first in
thy nakid will shall be turned in to felyng of affecco^n / without which virtue
either in true will or in felyng who so dispose him to serve god in
co^te^platyf life as the blind he shall sto^ble: and he shall never come thereto /
The hyer he clim^yth by bodily penance / and other virtues / and has not this
mekenes. the lower he falls / For as saint gregory says / Greg*
He that can not perfytly despise himself / he found never yet y^ meke wysdom
of our lord Ihu^ christ

How ypocrites and heretykes for lackyng of mekenes hyen hemself in her heart
above al other / Caplm xx.
YPocrites ne heretykes feel not this mekenes neither in good will ne in
affecco^n / but full dry and full cold arn her hertes and her reins fro the
soft felyng of this virtue / and in so much the ferder they ben fro it. that
they wene that they have it / They gnawe on ye dry bark without. but the
sweet kernel of it and the inly savor may they not come to / They show
outward mekenes in habit and holy speech: in lowly beryng / and as it semyth
in many bodily and ghostly virtues / But nevertheless in the will and in
thaffecco^n of her heart where mekenes should be: it is faint / For they deem
and despisen and setten at naught other men that will not do as they done and
teache / they holden hem either foles by vncu^nyng: or blinded by flesshly
living And therefore lift they hemself upon hye in her own sight above al
other. wenyng yt they live better than other: and that they have only the
sothfastnes of good living: and in ghostly felyng and synguler grace of god
both in knowing and in ghostly feling passing other men / And in this sight of
he^self ryseth a delight in her hertes in the which they worship and praise
hemself. as there were none but they. They praysen and thanken god with her
lyppes. but in her hertes they stelen as thieves the worship and the tha^kyng
fro god. and settith it in hemself / and so they have another mekenes in felyng
ne in will / A wretchyd caytyff or a syn^er which falls al day. and he is
sorry that he does so though he have not mekenes in affecco^n / he has it in a
good will / But an heretic or an ypocrite has neither / For they have the
co^dico^n of the pharyse / which came as our lord say the in the gospel with
the publican into the temple for to pray And when he came he prayed not ne
asked ought of god. for him thought he had no need. but he began to thank god
and said thus / Lord I thank the that thou yeuest me grace more than to other
that I am not as other men be / robbers lechours / or other such syn^ers / And
he lokid beside him and saw the publycan which he knew for a wretch:
knockyng on his breast only cryenge after mercy / then^e he thanked god that he
was not such one as he was / for lord he said I fast twyes in the weke / and I
pay truly my tithes / And wha^ he had do. our lord said that he yede home
again without grace as he came. and gate right naught / But now say you. wherein
trespassid this pharyse sith he thanked god and was soth that he said / As to
this I answer and say that this pharysee trespassid in asmoche as he demyd and
repreuid in his heart the publica^ which was justified of god / And also he
trespassyd for he thankyd god oonly with his mouth / but he delyted preuely and
wylfully by a preuy pride in himself of the yeftes of god: stelyng the worship
and loving fro god. and set it in himself / This same condycyon of this
pharysee sothely has heretykes and ypocrytes / They will not gladly pray /
and if they pray: they meke not he^self knowlegyng truly her wretchydnes / but
they make hemself by a fenyng for to thank and love god / and spekith of him
with her mouth / but her delight is vain and falls and not in god / And yet they
wene not so / they can not love god / For as the wise man says / No^ est
speciosa laus in ore peccatoris / It is neither fair Ecc xv^
ne semely praising of god in y^ mouth of a syn^er / wherefore it is profitable
to the and to me and to such other wretches forto leave the condition of this
pharisee and feined loving of god. and follow the plublican in lownes / askyng
mercy and foryeuenes of sins. and grace of ghostly virtues. that we might
afterward with a clean heart sothfastly thank him and love him / and give him
holy ye worship without feynyng / For our lord askith this by his prophet /
Super que^ reqescet sp^s meus. Isay^ 66
nisi super hu^ile^ contritu^ sp^u and tremente^ sermones meos? Upon whom shall
my spirit rest / and he answers himself and says. upon none but upon the
meke poor and contrite in heart and dredyng my words? Then^e if thou will have
the spirit of god rulyng in thy heart: have mekenes and dread him /

What things me^ owe to bileue by a siker faith / ca xxi
The ii. thing which the behouith for to have is siker troth in all tharticles
of the faith and in the sacrament of holy church / trowyng hem stedfastli with
al thy will in thy heart / And thou you feel any stiryng in thy heart against any
of hem by suggestion of thyn enmye for to put the in dowte of hem be thou
steadfast and not tomoche adrad of felyng of such stiringes / but forsake thyn
own wit wytout disputyng or ransakyng of hem / and set thy faith generally
in the faith of holy church / and charge not the stiryng of thy heart / which
as the semyth is contrary thereto / For that stiryng is not thy faith / but the
faith of holy church is thy faith / though you never see it ne feel it / And
bear then^e such stirynges pacie^tly as a scourge of our lord / by ye which
he will cle^se thy heart and make thy faith steadfast / Also the behouyth to love
and worship in thy heart al ye laws and ordinance made by prelates and rulers
of holy church other in declaryng of the faith or of the sacraments or in
general of al criste^ men / mekely and truly assent to hem / thou it be so
that you know not ye cause of her ordinance / And thou the think that some
were unskillful: you shall not deem hem ne repreue hem / but worship hem al
though they long but lytyl to y^ / Ne receive you none opinyon ne fa^tasie ne
synguler co^ceyte vnd color or more holiness as some done that are not wise /
another by thyn own ymagynyng. ne by techyng of none other man. which
contraryeth to the the lest ordinance or general techyng of al holy church.
And over this you shall hope ^tedfastly yt thou art ordened of our lord to be
saved. as one of his chose^ by his mercy / and stire not fro this hope what so
thou herist or see / or what te^ptaco^n thou be in / And though thou think
so ye great a wretch that you were worthy to synke in to hell for that thou
do no good / ne seruest god as thou sholdest do / yet hold the in this
troth and in this hope / and ask mercy^ and al shall be right well / ye and
though all the deuylles of hell apered in bodily lyknes slepyng or wakyng
saye^ge to the that thou sholdest not be saved / or al men living in earth / or
all the angels in heaven / if it might be said to the the same / thou sholdest
not leave hem. ne be stired much fro the hope of saluaco^n This I say to the /
for some be^ so weyke and so simple y^ when they have yeue^ hemself al holy to
serve god after her cunning if they feel any stiryng within by thyncastyng of
the^mye / or else fro without of any of the deuylles prophets which me^
callen sothsayers that they should not be saved / or her state of her manner of
living were not plesau^t to god / they be^ astonyed and stired with such
words / and so for vncu^nyng they fall so^ time in to great heaviness / and as
it were in a dispayr of salvation / wherefore as me think it is spedful to
every creature which by the grace of our lord ^hu^ christ is in full will to
forsake syn^e / and as clerly as his conscience tellith him he suffers no
dedely syn^e rest in him that he ne shryueth him soon thereof. and meke him to
the sacraments of holy church / for to have a trust of saluaco^n / And much
more than they that yeue^ hem holy to god. and fleen venyal sins after her
might / And on ye contrary wise as peryllous it is to him which lies
wyttyngly in dedely syn^e for to have trust of salvation / and in hope of ye
trust will not forsake his syn^e ne low him truly to god and holy church /

How a stable intent is needful to thise that should plese god / and descreco^n
in bodily works / Ca xxii.
THe iii. thing which is nedeful to the for to have in thy begyn^yng. is an
hole and a stable ente^co^n. that is for to saey / A hole will and a desire
only for to plese god / for that is charity / without which al is naught that
you do And thou shall set thyn intent always for to search and traueyle how
thou might plese him. no time for to cesse wylfully of good ocupaco^n other
bodily or ghostly / Ne thou shall not set a time in thy heart. as thus long you
would serve god. and sithe^ to suffer thin heart wylfully fall down into vayn
thoutes and idle ocupacio^s / wenyng that it were nedful for saui^g of thy
bodily kind: leuynge the keeping of thy heart and good ocupaco^n. sekyng a rest
and comfort for a time outward by thy bodili wits. or inwardli vanitees. as
it were for recreaco^n of thy spirit / for it should be more sharper afterward
to ghostly traueyle / for I trow it is not soth / I say not that thou may in
deed perform thyn intent. for oftsithes thy bodily need. etyng drynking
slepyng and spekyng / and the freiltee of thy flessh^ shall let the be thou
never so besye / and hinder the / But I would that thy will and thy intent were
always hole to traueyle ghostly or bodily. and no time to be idle / but always
liftyng up thy heart by desire to god and to the bliss of heaven whether you ete
or drink. or oni other bodily trauelle that thou use: asmoche as you may
wylfully leave it not / For if thou have this intent it shall make y^ ever quick
and sharp in thy traueyle / And if you fall by freilte or neclige^ce in any
idle ocupaco^n or vainspeche it shall smite upon thy heart sharply as a prycke
and make y^ for to yrke and be weary of al vanytees / and for to torn again
hastly to inward thynkyng of Ihu^ christ. or to some good ocupaco^n / For anence
thy bodily kind it is good for to use descrecion in etyng drynkyng and
slepyng^ and in all manner bodily penance. and in long prayer by speech / or in
bodily feli^g by great fervor of deuoco^n other in weeping or such other /
and also in ymaginyng of the spirit wha^ a man felyth no grace / ^n al thise
works it is good to keep descreco^n / for the mean is the best / But in
destruyng of syn^e by keeping of thin heart. and in co^tynuel desire of virtues.
and the bliss of heaven / and for to have the ghostly knowing and the loving of
Ihu^ christ hold you no mean / For the more that it is of this the better it
is / For you shall hate syn^e and all flesshly loves and dredes in thyn heart
without seesyng. And thou shall love virtues and clen^es: and desire hem
without styntyng if thou might / I say not that it is nedfull to saluaco^n /
but I hope it is spdeful. and if thou keep it thou shall profit more in one
year in virtues than you shall without this profit in vii. years /

Of a lityl rehersyng of things said before / and of making of offryng that
should be offryd to god / Caplm xxiii.
NOw I have told the first of end which thou shall behold in thy desire /
and draw toward it as nygh as thou may / Also I have said the of the begyn^yng
what y^ needs for to have / as mekenes siker troth / and an hole intent to
god / upon the which ground thou shall set thy ghostly house by prayer and
by meditaco^n and other ghostly virtues / Then^e say I to the thus / pray thou
or think thou. or oni other deed that thou do good by grace / or bad by
thyn own freilte / or what that thou felist see or herest: smellest or save
rest wythoutforth in thy bodily wits / or within in ymaginaco^n knowing or
felyng in thy reso^ / bring it all within y^ troth and the rules of holy
church / and cast al in ye mortar of mekenes / and break it small with the
pestell of dread of god / and through the powder of all this in the fire of
desire / and offer it so to god / and I tell y^ forsooth well shall that offryng
like in the syghte of thy lord Ihu^ / and sweet shall the smoke of that fire
smelle to the face of thy lord Ihesu / This is for to say / Draw all this
that thou felyst within the truth of holy church. and break thyself in
mekenes / And offer the desire of thyn heart oonly to thy lord Ihu^ for to have
him and naught else but him / And if thou do thus / I hope by the grace of
christ thou shall never be overcome by thyn enmye / This taught us saint poul
when he said thus / Sieve manducatis sieve bibitis. sieve quicquid aliud facitis.

Of prayer that is spedeful to get clennes of heart and virtues / Caplm xxiiii.
PRayer is profit and spedfull to use for to get clen^es of heart by
destroyeng of syn^e and receyuyng of virtues / Not that thou sholdest by thy
prayer make our lord know what thou desyrest For he knows well enough what
the needs / but for to make the able and ready by thy prayer that thou might
receive as a clean vessel. the grace yt our lord will freely give to the /
which grace may not be felt till thou be as said and purifyed by the fire of
desire in devout prayer. For though it be so that prayer is not the cause for
which our lord yeueth grace / nevertheless it is a way by the which grace
freely yeuen comyth to a soul /

How men should pray / and whereon the point of her thought shall be set in
prayer / Caplm xxv.
But now desire thou perauenture for to know how thou sholdest pray / And
upon what thing thou should set the point of thy thought in thy prayer / And
also what prayer were best for the for to use / As to the first I answer and
say thus / That when thou art wakenyd of thy sleep / and ready for to pray.
thou shall feel thyself flesshly and heavy ever dou^warde to vayn thoughts.

it as much as thou may to some deuoco^n / And in thy prayer that thou set not
thyn heart in any bodily thing / but al thy traueyle shall be for to draw in
thought fro beholding of all bodily thing / that thy desire might be as it
were nakyd and bare fro al erthly things / ever upward styeng unto Ihu^ christ.
whom you may never see bodily as he is in his godhede. ne by bodily lyknes in
ymagynacio^ / But you may through devout and co^tinuel beholding of the mekenes
of his precious ma^hede feel the godenes and the grace of his godhede: wha^ thy
desire is eased and helped and as it were made free fro al flesshly thoughts
and afecco^ns. and is much lift up by ghostly might in to ghostly savor and
delight in him of his ghostly prese^ce^ and hold therein much of the time of
thy prayer so that thou have no great mind of erthly thing / or else the
mind greueth y^ but lityl / if you can pray thus / then^e can thou pray well /
For prayer is naught else but a styenge desire of the heart in to god: by
wythdrawyng of the heart fro al erthly thoughts / And so is prayer lykned to a
fire / which of his own kind leueth ye lowenes of the earth / and always
styeth up in to thayer Right so desire in prayer wha^ it is towchid and

Of the fire of love / Caplm xxvi.
A^ men yt speke^ of the fire of love known not well what it is / for what it
is I can not tell ye. save this I may tell y^: that it is neither bodily. ne
bodily felyd / A soul may feel it in prayer or in deuoco^n. which soul is
in ye body / but he felith it not with no bodily wit / For though it be so
y^ it work in a soule^ ye body may torn in to an hete / and as it were
chauffyd for likyng traueyle of y^ spirit / Netheles y^ fire of love is not
bodily. for it is only in ye ghostly desire of ye soul This is no dowte to
no man or woman that felith deuoco^n / But some be^ simple and wene by cause
it is called fire yt it should be hot as bodily fire is / and for thy I say yt
I have said

That the certain prayer in speech ordened of god and of holy church is best to
hem that been new turned to god and to deuoco^n / Caplm xxvii.
NOw as to ye other. for to know what prayer were best for to use / I shall say
as me think / Thou shall vndstonde that there be^ iii. manner of prayers The
first is prayer of speech made specially of god. as is the pater nost: and made
also more generally by thordynau^ce of holy church. as matins eue^song and
hours. And also made by devout men of other special saye^ges as to our lord
and to our lady / and to his sai^tes / As to this manner of prayer which is
callid vocal me thinks unto the that art religious and by custom and rule
art bound for to say mateyns and hours I hold it most spedeful for to say
hem as devoutly as you may / For when thou say thy mateyns / you say also
thy pater nost pri^cipally and other more / For to styre the to more deuoco^n
was it ordened for to say also psalms and ympnes and such other which be^
made by the holy ghost as ye pater nost is / And therefore you shall not say hem
hastily and rechelesly as thou were evil apayd that you art bound with hem /
but thou shall gader thyn affecco^n and thy thought for to say hem more sadly
and more devoutly than any other special prayer of deuoco^n. trowyng forsooth
that since it is ye prayer of holy church / there is no prayer so profitable
to ye which is vocal forto use comynly as y^ is. And so shall you put away al
heaviness / and by grace you shall turn thy need in to a good will: and thy bond
in to a great fredom. y^ it shall no lettyng be to the of ghostly ocupaco^n.
And after this you may if thou will use other. as thy pater nost. or any such
other. and of thise in the which you felest most savor and most ghostly
comfort in / y^ hold I best to ye. this manner of prayer is spedful comynly to
every man in ye begyn^ing of his conversion for to use most of any other
ghostly ocupaco^n / For a man in the begyn^yng is rude and boystous and
flesshly but if he have the grace / and can not think no ghostly thoughts in
meditaco^n. for his soul is not yet cle^sed fro old syn^e / and therefore I
hope it is most spedful for to use this manner of prayer / as for to say his
pat noster and his aue: and to read upon his sawter / and such other / For he
y^ can not ren^e lightly by ghostly prayer. for his fete of knowing and of
loving be^ seek for syn^e, him needs to have a siker staff for to hold him by
/ This staff is special prayer of speech ordened by god and holy church in
help of men^is souls / By y^ which prayer the soul of a flesshly man that
is always falling dou^warde into worldly thoughts and flesshly affecco^ns shall
be lift up fro hem and beholde^ by it as by a staff. fed with sweet words of
the prayer as a child wc milk / and ruled by it that he fall not in to
errors ne fa^tasyes by his vayn meditaco^ns / For in this manner of prayer is
no deceyte who so will steadfastly and mekely traueyle therein /

What peril is to men yt in the begyn^yng of her tornyng to god leueth the
common prayer of thordynau^ce of holy church / and yeuen hem to medytaco^n*
Caplm xxviii.
THen^e may you see by this that thise men if any be such yt in the begyn^yng
of her conversion or soon after when they have felt a lityl ghostly comfort
other in deuocio^ or in knowing and are not yet stabled therein: they leave such
prayer vocal tosone and other bodily exercise. and give hem holy to meditacion
they be^ not wise / For often sithes in her rest for her meditacyo^s they ymagyn
and think on ghostly things after her own wytt and follow her bodily felyng /
and have not yet received grace thereto: and therefore they by vndescreco^n often
sithes ouertraueyle her wittes^ and breke^ her bodily might. and so they fall
in to fantasies and syngler co^ceytes or in opyn errors: and lette^ ye grace
that god yeuith he^ by such vanitees. ye cause of all this is a prive pride of
hemself. as wha^ they have felt a lityl grace they wene it so much passing
other yt they fall in vaynglory. and so they lose it / ^f they wist how lityl
it were that they feel in regard of that y^ god yeuith or may give. they should
be ashamyd to speak out thereof. but it were in great need / Of this manner of
prayer by speech. spekith david in ye sawter thus / Voce mea ad dn^m clamaui.
P^ xiiii.
voce mea ad dn^m dep^catus sum / ^oo david the prophet for to styre other men
to pray both with heart and with mouth said / with my voys I cried to god. and
with my speech I besought our lord /

Of the ii. manner of prayer that is in speech not certain. but folowith the
stiryng of deuoco^n / Caplm xxix
THe ii. manner of prayer is by speech / but it is not of any certain special
saye^g / And this is wha^ a man or a woman felith grace of deuoco^n by the yeft
of god. and in his deuoco^n spekith to him. as he were bodily in his presence
with such words as acordeth most to his stiryng for the time. and as comyth
to his mind after diverse rewards which he felith in his heart / either
rehersyng his sins and his wretchydnes. or ye malice and the sleyghtes of the
enmye / or else the mercy and y^ goodness of god / And with that he cries with
desire of hert^ and with speech of mouth to our lord for socour and for help.
as a man that were in peril among his enmyes. or in siknes showing his sores
to god as to a leche / saye^g as david said: P^ c. i^^.
^ripe me de inimicis meis deus meus / A lord deliver me of mine enmyes / Or
else thus / Sana ai^am mea^ qr peccaui tibi / A lord hele my soul. P^ xl.
for I have syn^ed against the / Or such other as comith to mind. And also him
thinkith so much godenes and grace and mercy in god that him likyth with
great affection of ye heart for to love him and thank him by such words and
psalms as acordeth to ye loving and praising of god. as david said Co^fitemini
dn^o qm^ bonus. qm^ in scl mi^a eius. P^
Love ye and praise our lord. for he is good / and by such other as he is
stired to say

That the ii. manner of prayer pleseth much god. and makith a man to have him
in body as he were dronke / and makith him in soul to be won^ded with the
sword of love / Cplm xxx
THis manner of prayer much pleseth god. for it is oonly of ye affeccio^ in the
heart / and therefore it goth never vnsped without some grace / this prayer
lo^geth to the ii. part of conte^placo^n as I have said before / who soo^ has
this yeft of god ferue^tly / him behouyth for the time to flee presence and
company of al men: and to be alone that he be not let / who so have it
hold it while he may / for it may not long last in the fervor For if grace
come ple^teuously. it is traueylous wondfully to the spirit: though it be
likyng / And it is much wasting to ye bodily kind who so much use it / For
it makith the bodi if grace come myghtly for to styre and turn here and there
as a man that were mad or dro^ken and cowde have no rest / this is a point
of the passion of love / the which by great violence and maistry brekith down
al lusts and likings of any erthly thing / and it wou^deth the soul with
the blisful sword of love. that the body falls down and may not bear it This
touching is of so great might that the most vicyous or flesshli man lyuinge in
earth: if he were well towched ones myghtly with this sharpelswerde / he should
be right sad and sobre a great while after: and loathe all the lusts and
likings of his flesh: and al erthly thiges which he had most delight in /

How the fire of love wastes al flesshly lusts / as other fire wastyth bodily
things / Caplm xxxi.
OF this manner of feeling spekith the prophet Ieremye thus. Tren^^
Et factus est in cord meo quasi ignis estua^s claususque in ossibus meis. and
defeci far no^ sustine^s / This is thus much for to vndstonde The love and
the felyng of god was made in my heart not fire / but as fire glowyng / For as
bodily fire brenneth and wastes al bodily thing where it comith / Right so
ghostly fire / as is the love of god brenneth and wastes all flesshly loves
and likings in a man's soul / And this fire is stokyn in my bones / as the
prophet says of himself: That is for to say / This love fulfyllith the might
of my soule^ as mind reason and will of grace and ghostly swetnes / as marow
fyllith full the bone. and that within. and not without in ye wits Nevertheless
it is so mighty within that it smyteth out in to the body and makith all the
body quake and tremyse / It is sofer tro the bodily kind and so uncouth that
he can no skyll on it. and may not bear it / but faylith and fallyth down as
the prophet says / And therefore our lord temperith it. and with drawyth the
fervor: and suffers the heart to fall in to a sobirte of more softnes / who
can pray thus often. he spedyth soon in his traueyle / He shall get more of
virtues in a lityl time tha^ some man without this or a another as good shall
get in long time. for all ye bodily penance that he might do / And who has
this. it needs not for to charge ye bodily kind with more penance than it
berith / if he have it often /

Of the third manner of prayer that is only in the heart without speech
outward / Caplm xxxii
THe iii. manner of prayer is only in the heart without speech by great rest
and softnes of the body and of the soul / A clean heart him behooves to have
that shall pray well thus For it is of such men and wym^en that by long
traueylle bodily and ghostly / or else by such sharp smytinges of love as I
have before said comen in to rest of spirit / so that her affeccion is
turned in to ghostly savor / that they mow nygh contynuelly pray in her
heart / and love and praise god without great lettyng of temptaco^ns or of
vanytees. as I have before said in the second part of contemplacyon / Of this
manner of prayer says saint poul thus / Nam si orem lingua: spiritus meus orat.
men's autem mea sine fructu est^ Quid ergo? Cor^ xiiii.
Orabo and spiritu orabo and mente^ psallam spiritu psallam and mente That is
to say / if I pray with my tongue only by ye will of spirit and by traueyle
/ ye prayer is medeful. but my soul is not fed / For it felyth not the fruit
of ghostly swetnesse by understanding / What shall I then do says saint
poul / And he answerith and says / I shall pray by traueyle and desire of the
spirit / And I shall pray also more Inwardly in my spyrite without traueyle
in ghostly savor and swetnes of ye love and the sight of god / by the which
sight and felyng of love my soul is fed / Thus as I vndstonde saint poul
cowde pray / Of this manner of prayer spekith our lord in holy writ by
figure thus / Ignis in altari meo se^per ardebit. and cotidie sacerdos surgens
mane subiciet ligna vt ignis no^ extinguat / Leuit. 6.
This is for to say / The fire of love shall ever be light in the soul of a
devout and clean man or woman / the which is the awter of our lord / And the
pressed shall every day at morn lay to styckes and norysshe the fire / That is
to say / This man shall by holy psalms: clean thoughts. and fervent desire
norysshe the fire of love in his heart that it goo not out in any time / This
rest our lord ye^yth to some of his servants as it were a reward of her
traueyle. and a shadow of the love which they shall have in the bliss of
heaven /

How men should do that been traueyled with vain thoughts in her prayers /
Caplm xxxiii^
But now see thou that I speak over hye to the in this manner of prayer / for
it is no maystry to me for to say it / but for to do it there is the maystry
/ Thou say that you can not pray thus deuoutli ne so holy in heart as I
speak of For when thou would have the mind of thyn heart upward to god in
thy prayer. thou felyst so many thoughts in vein of thyn own deeds before
done or what thou shall do / and of other men^es deeds / and such many other
/ lettyng and tarye^g the so that thou may another feel savor ne rest ne
deuoco^n in thy saying / and oftsithes the more thou traueilest to keep thyn
heart: the ferder it is fro the: and the hardersomtyme fro the begyn^yng to the
last end: that the think it is but lost all that thou do / And unto this
that thou say that I speak to hie to the of prayer / I grant well that I
speak otherwise than I can or may do / Nevertheless I say it for this intent /
that you sholdest know how we ought to pray if we did well / And sithen we may
not do so / that we know then^e our feebleness mekely^ and cry god mercy / Our
lord bad thus hymsel wha^ he said / Diliges dn^m deu^ tuu^ ex toto cord tuoex
tota aia tua. M^ xxii.
and ex oibus viribus tuis / Thou shall love god of al thyn heart and al thy
soul. and al thy might / It is impossible to any man for to fulfylle this
biddyng so fully as it is said. living in earth / And yet nevertheless our
lord bad us for to love so for this intent as saint bernarde says / that we
should know thereby our feebleness / and then mekely cry after mercy / and we
shall have it / Nevertheless I shall tell ye as me thynkith in this askyng / when
thou shall pray make thin intent and thy will in the begyn^yng as hole and as
clean to god as thou may shortly in thy mind / and then^e begyn^e and do as
thou may. And though you be never somoche let against thy first will. be
not adrad: ne to angry with thyself / ne inpacye^t against god: that he yeueth
the not the savor and ghostly swetnes with deuoco^n as the thinks that he
yeueth to other creatures / But see thereby thyn own feebleness: and bear it
easily / holdi^g in thyn own sight thyn own prayer feeble as it is with
mekenes of heart / trustyng also sikerly in the mercy of our lord that he shall
make it good and profitable to the more than thou know or felest / For wite
thou well that thou art exscused of thy debt: and thou shalt have mede for it
as for an other good deed yt thou do in charity though thyn heart were not
thereupon in the doing / Therefore do that longs to the. and suffer our lord
to give what he will: and teache him not And though thou think thyself recheles
and neclygent / and as thou were in great defawte for such things /
Nevertheless yet shall thou for this defawte and all other venyals which may
not be eschewed in this wretchyd life lift up thyn heart to god / knowlegyng thy
wretchydnes / and cry mercy with a good trust of foryeuenes and strive no
more therewith: ne hang no longer thereupon as thou would by maistry not feel
such wretchidnes / ^eue of and goo to some other good deed bodily or ghostly /
and think for to do better a another time / But though thou fall on a another
time in the same. ye an hundred times / ye a thousand times / yet do as I
have said: and all shall be well / Ferder more a soul that never may find
rest of heart in prayer / but all her life time is striuyng with her thoughts
and taryeth and trowbleth with hem / if she keep her in mekenes and charity in
other sides / she shall have full much mede in heaven for her good traueyle /

Of meditaco^n of synful men after that they ben hooli turned to god / Caplm
xxxiiii.
Now of meditaco^n shall I tell yt a lityll as me thinks Thou shall vndstonde
that in meditaco^ns may no certain rule well be set every man for to keep / for
they are in free yeft of our lord after the diverse disposynges of chosen sowles
/ and after the state that they ben in / And also after yt they profyten in
virtues and in her astate. so he increases her meditaco^ns both in ghostly
knowing and loving of him. For who so is ever ylike wise in knowing of god and
ghostly things it semyth that he wexeth but a lityl in the love of god / and
that may be showed opinly in thapostles. wha^ they in ye day of pe^tecost were
fulfilled with bren^yng love of ye holy ghost. they were made neither foles ne
foltis / but they were made wonder wise both in knowing and spekyng of god and
of ghostly things / asmoche as a man might have in flesh living / Thus
spekyth holy writ of hem / Repleti su^t oe^s sp^u scto^. et ceperu^t loqui
magnalia dei / They were fulfilled of the holy ghoost / and they began to speak
the great merueyles of god / And all that knowing they had by rauisshyng in
love of the holy ghost / Diverse meditacyons there ben / which our lord
puts in a man's heart. Some shall I tell the as me thynkith for this intent
/ If thou feel any of hem that you sholdest ye better traueyle in hem / In the
beginning of conversion of such a man that has be much foiled with worldly
or flesshely sins / comynly his thought is most upon his sins with great
compunccion and sorrow of heart / with great wepynges and many teres of the eye
/ mekely and besely asking merci and for yeuenes of god for hem / And if he be
towchyd sharply for our lord will make him soon clean / him shall think that
his sins are ever in his sight so foul and so horrible that uneath shall he
mow bear himself / And though he shryue him never so clerly / yet shall he find
fightyng and fretyng and bitynge of his conscience that him shall think that
he is not shriuen right / And uneath shall he mow have any rest / in somoche
that he should not endure such traueyle ne were it that our lord of his mercy
comfort him sometime as he will by great deuoco^n of his passion or of some
other as he will give it. Upon this manner werketh our lord in some men^es
hertes more or less as he will / And all this is the great mercy of our lord
that not oonly will foryeue the sin or the trespase / but he will both
forgive the trespase and the pain for it in purgatory for such a lityl pain
here of bityng of conscience / And also if he will dispose a man to receive any
special yefte of the love of god / him behouyth first to be scowred and
cleansed by such a fire of compuncco^n for all the great sins before done / Of
this manner traueylle spekith david in many places of the sawter / and specially
in the psalm Miserere mei deus / P^ l.


That the meditaco^n of the manhede of christ or of his passion is yeuen freely
of the holy ghost / And how it shall be known when it is yeuen / Caplm xxxv.
ANd then sometime after this traueyle. and sometime with all. such a man or
else a another the which by grace of god has be kept in Innoce^ce / our lord
yeuith a meditaco^n of his manhede / as of his birth or of his passo^n. and of
the compassyon of our lady saint mary / when this medytaco^n is made by the
holy ghost / then it is right profitable and gracyous / And that thou shall
wite by this token / When it is so that thou art styred to a meditaco^n in god
/ and thy thought is suddenly drawn out fro all worldly and flesshly things
and the thinks as thou see in thy soul thy lord Ihu^ in a bodily lyknes
as he was in earth / and how he was taken of the Jews and bounden as a theyf /
beten and dispysed. scourged and demid to death / How lowely he bare the cross
upon his back and how cruelly he was neyled thereupon / Also of the crown of
thorns upon his head / and of the sharp spear that stykked him to the heart /
and thou in this ghostly sight felyst thyn heart styred to so great compassion
and pity of thy lord Ihesu ye thou mornest and wepest and criest with all the
myghtes of thy body and of thy soul / wo^deryng the goodness and the love. the
pacyence and the mekenes of thy lord Ihu^ / that he would for so sifull a
caytif as thou art suffer so much pain / And nevertheless thou felist
somoche goodness and mercy in our lord that thyn heart ryseth up in to a love
and a gladness of him with many sweet teres: having great trust of foryeuenes of
thy sins and of salvation of thy soul by the virtue of this precious passion
/ That when the mind of crystis passion or any point of his manhede is thus
made in thyn heart by such a ghostly syghte / with deuowte affecco^n answeryng
thereto / wit you well then that it is not of thyn own werkyng. ne feynynge
of no wyckid spirit / but by the grace of the holy ghost For it is an openyng
of the ghostly eye in to crystis manhede And it may be called the flesshly
love of god / As saint bernarde callith it / Bern^:
In as much as it is set in the flesshly kind of christ / And it is right
good and a great help in destroyeng of great sins / and a good way to come
to wertues / and so after to contemplacyon of the godhede / For a man shall not
come to ghostly light in contemplacyon of crystis godhede / but if he come
first in ymagynaco^n by bitterness and by compassion / and by steadfast thynkyng
of his manhede / Thus saint poul did / First he said thus / Nichil indicaui me
scire inter vos. nisi ih^m xp^m et hunc crucifixum / I showed you right naught
that I couth^ p^^ cor. 6*
but Ihesu christ. and him crucified / As if he had said / My knowing and my
trust is oonly in ye passion of christ / And therefore said he thus also / Michi
aute^ absit gloriari nisi in cruce dn^i nostri ihu^ cristi / Gal. 9*
Forbode^ be fro me all manner of Joy and likyng but in ye cross and in the
passion of our lord Ihesu christ / And nevertheless afterward he said thus /
Predicamus vobis xp^m dei virtutem and dei sapiencia^ / As who says / First I
preached of the manhede and the passion of christ / Now I preche to you of the
godhede. p^^ cor. ^*
As thus / That christ is the might of god / and the endless wysdom of god /

That the meditacyon of the passion of christ is wythdrawen fro hem that it is
yeuen to often sythes for diverse causes / Caplm xxxvi.
THis manner of meditaco^n a man has not always wha^ he would / but when our
lord will give it / Unto some men and wymmen he yeuyth it all their life time
by sythes when he vysyteth hem / As some men arne so tender in her affection
that when they here men speak / or else that they thynken of his precious
passion. her hertes melten in devotion / and arne fed and comforted against
all manner temptacyons of the enmye / And that is a great yeft of god / To some
men he yeueth it first plenteuously / and afterward he with draws it for
diverse causes Other if a man wexe proud of it in his own sight / or for some
other sin / by the which he makith himself unable for to receive the grace
/ Or else our lord wythdrawyth it / and all other deuocyons sometime fro a man
or a woman / for he will suffer him to be assayd by temptacyons of his enmye /
And so will he dyspose a man for to know and feel himself more ghostly / For
he said so himself to his discyples / ^xpedit vobis vt ego vadam / Si enim no^
abiero: Ioh^^ 16.
peraclitus non veniet ad vos / It is spedefull to you that I goo fro you
bodily / For if I goo not the holy ghost may not come to you / For as long as
he was with hem they loved him much / but it was flesshly in his manhede / And
therefore it was spedefull to hem that he should wythdrawe the bodily form fro
her sight / that the holy ghost might come to hem / and teache hem for to love
him and know him more ghostly / as he did on the day of pentecost. Right so
it is spedefull to some that our lord wythdrawe a lityl the bodily and the
flesshly liknes fro theye of the soul that the heart might be set and fyxed
more besily in ghostly desire / and sekyng of his godhede /

Of diverse temptaco^ns of the fend / Caplm xxxvii.
Nevertheless it behouith a man to suffer many temptacions first / And these
temptacyo^s fallen oftsythes to some men and wymmen after when comfort is
wythdrawen / upon diverse manners by malice of the enmye / As thus. when the
devil perceyueth devotion much wythdrawen. that the soul is left as it were
nakyd for a time / then sends he to some men temptaco^ns of lechery of
glotenye. so hot and so brennyng / that hem shall think that they felyd
never none so grievous in all her life time before when they yaaf hem most to
sin. In so much that they shall think it impossyble for to stand long and
suffer that they ne shall needs fall but they have help / And therefore have
they then much sorrow / both for lackyng of comfort and deuoco^n which
they were wont to have / And they have much dread of falling fro god by such
open sins / And all this werkyth the devil at the suffraunce of god for to
done hem forthynke her good pourpoos / and turn again to sin as they were
wont to do / But who so will abide awhyle and suffer a lityll pain / and
not turn again to sin for no thing the hand of our lord is full nere /
and helpyth right soon For he kepyth him full sykerly / and the man wot not
how as the prophet david says in the person of our lord. Cum ip^o sum in
tribulaco^ne. P^ 9^.
eripiam eu^ and glorificabo eum / I am with him in his trybulaco^n / and in
temptacyon I shall deliver him / and I shall make him glorious in my bliss /
Some men he tempts by ghostly sins malicyously. as by mystrowyng of the
faith or of the sacrament of our lordis blessed body / Also of despeyr or of
blasphemy in our lord or oni of his saints / or lothynge of her life / or
bitterness or unskillful heaviness / or of tomoche dread of hemself and of her
bodi if they put hem holy to goddis seruyse / Some men he tempts also. and
namly solitary men and wymmen by dredes and vglynes. and quakynges and
shakynges / either apperynge to hem in bodily lyknes or else in ymagyning
slepynge and wakyng / And taryeth hem so that uneath may they have any rest.
And also on many other wyses he tempts. moo than I can or may say /

Of diverse remedies against temptaco^ns of the fend Caplm xxxviii.
Emedie to such men and wymmen that arn thus traueyled. or any otherwise. may
be this / First that they will put all her trust in our lord Ihu^ christ / and
bring to mind often his passion: and the peynes that he suffered for us / and
that they then trow steadfastly that all sorrows and traueyle that they
suffer in such temptacyons / which to an vncunnyng man semyth a forsakyng of
god / That it is no repreuyng ne no forsakynge / but assayenge for her better
/ Either for clensyng of her sins before done / or for great encreasynge of
her mede and disposyng to much grace / if they will suffer a while / and
stand fast that they torn not again wylfully to sin / A another remedy is.
that they dread not ne charge not as for a sin. ne set not at heart such
malicyous stirynges of dispeyre or of blasphemye or of the sacrament. or any
such other that were ugly for to here / For the feeling of these temptacio^s
fyleth the soul no more than if they herd an hou^de berke. or a flee byte /
They tarie^ the soul / but they apeyre not the soul if a man will dispyse
hem. and set hem at naught / For it is not good for to strive with hem for to
put he^ out by maystry / For the more that they strive with such thoughts.
the more they cleue to hem / And therefore they shallen as much as they may
draw out the thought fro hem / and set it to some other ocupaco^n / And yet
if they will ever hang upon hem / then it is good to hem that they be not
angri ne heavy to feel hem / but with a good trust in god bear hem as it were a
bodily pain and a scourge of our lord for clensynge of her sins. as long
as he will for his love / as he was scourged and bare the cross for her love /
And over this it is good to hem for to show her hertes to some wise man in the
beginning before they ben roted in the heart / and that they leave her own wit
and follow the counseyle of him / And that they show hem not lightly to none
vncunnyng or worldly man which never felt such temptaco^ns / For they might
lightly bring a simple sole in to dispeyre by vncu^nynge of hemself / Of these
manner of temptaco^ns by the which a man semyth forsaken of god and is not / In
comfort of hem that arne tempted our lord says thus by his prophet / In
modico dereliqui te. Isa. liiii
and in momento indignaco^nis me percussite / et in miseraco^nibus meis multis
congegabo te / In a lityll I for left the / That is to say. I suffered the for
to be tarried a lityl And in a point of my wrath I smote the. that is to say /
All the penance and the pain that thou suffrest here is but a point of mi
wrath in regard of the pain of hell or of purgatori And yet in my manyfolde
mercies I shall gader together the / when the thinks that thou art forsaken.
then^e shall I of mi great mercy gader ye again to me / For when thou wenyst that
thou art as it were lost: then shall our lord help the as Job says / Cu^
te consumptu^ putaueris: Job xi.
orieris vt lucifer et habebis fiducia^ / That is to say. when thou art
brought so low by traueyle in temptaco^n that the thinks none help ne no
comfort. but as thou were a forloor man / yet stand styfly in hope and pray
god. and sothly thou shall suddenly spring up as the day sterre in gladness of
heart: and have a very trust in god as Job says /

How that god hem that he cheseth he suffers to be tarried and tempted. and
afterward comfort hem. and stableth hem in grace / Caplm xxxix.
ANd also in comfort of such men that they should not dyspeyre in temptacyon.
the wise man says thus of our lord / In temptaco^ne ambulat cu^ eo / In
primis elegit eum. (...) iiii*
ti morem and metu^ and approbaco^nem inducit super illu^. et cruciabit illu^
in tribulaco^ne doctrine sue donec temptet illu^ in cogitaco^ nibus suis. et
credet anime illius. ad iter directu^ adducet illum. and firmabit illu^ and
letificabit illu^ / et denudabit abscondita sua illi: et thezaurisabit super
illu^ sciencia^ and intellectu^ iusticie / This is thus much for to say / The
wise man for he would that no man should dispeyre in temptaco^n. in comfort of
hem saiht thus / In temptaco^n our lord forsakes not a man. but he gooth with
him fro the begyn^yng in to the last end / For he says / first he chesyth
him / And that is when he drawyth a man to him by comfort of devotion / And
afterward sorrow and dread and assayenge he brings upon him And that is /
when he wythdraweth devotion and suffers him to be tempted / And he says that
he turmenteth him in tribulaco^n until he have well assayd him in his
thoughts / And until a man will put all his trust in him fully / And then
after this our lord brings him out in to the right way / and testenyth him
to him and gladeth him / and sythen shewyth him his pyuytees / and yeuyth him
his tresour of knowing and understanding of ryghtwysnes / By these words of
holy writ may thou see that thise temptaco^ns or any other be they never so
ugly. to a man that by grace is in full will to forsake sin arne spedefull
and profitable if he will suffer as he may and abide goddis wyll^ and not
turn again to syn^e which he has forsaken for no sorrow ne pain ne dread
of such temptacyons / but ever stand still in traueyle and in prayer with
good hope / Our lord of his endless goodness having pity and mercy of al his
creatures when he sees time he lays to his hand and smyteth down the devil
and al his power / and eases hem of her traueyle / And puts away all
dredes and sorrows and derkenes out of her hertes / and brings in to her
souls light of grace / and openyth the sight of the soul for to see that all
the traueyle that they had it was spedefull to hem / yeuyng to hem also a new
ghostly might to ayenstonde all the fondynges of the fend / and all dedely
sins without great traueyle / and ledeth hem in to a sadness of good virtues
living / In the which if they ben meke he keeps hem unto her last end / and
then he takes hem all holy to him / This thing I say to the if thou be
tarried or traueyled with any such manner of temptacyons / be not tomoche
adradde / but do as I have said and better if thou may / And I hope by the
grace of Ihesu christ thou shalt never be overcome by thine enmye /

That a man should not give him to ydlenes ne lightly leave the grace yt is yeuen
him of god / Caplm xl
After this when you art escaped such temptacio^s or else our lord has so
kept y^ as he does many by his mercy that thou have not be tarried much with
none such / Then^e it is good to the that thou turn not thy rest in to
ydilnesse For there is many a man that takyth rest upon him to sone But thou
shall yt thou will begin a new game and a new traueyle / And that is for to
enter within in to thyn own soul by medytacion for to know what it is / And
by the knowing thereof to come to the ghostly knowing of god For saint austyn
says / Aug^
By the knowing of myself I shall hete the knowing of god / I say not that it
is nedeful to the and debt for to traueyle so ne to none other man / but he
feel him styred by grace as he were called thereto / For our lord gives diverse
gifts where so he will / not to one man all / ne to al men one / saaf charity
which is common to all men / And therefore if a man or a woman have received a
yefte of god. as devotion in prayer / or in the passion of christ / Or any
other be it never so lityll / leave it not to soon for none other / but if he
feel sothfastly a better / But hold that he has and traueyle therein stably /
ever desiryng a better when god will give it / Nevertheless if that be
wythdrawen somewhat and he sees a better / and felith his heart styred thereto /
Then semith it a calling of our lord to the better / And then it is time
that he follow after for to get it / and fulfylle it as swyftly as he may /

That a man should know the mesure of his gift that he may desire and take a
better when god will give it / Caplm xli.
Our holy faders here before taughten us that we should know the mesure of our
gift / And upon that work not taking upon us by feynyng more than we have in
felinge / We mow ever desire the best / but we mow not ever work ye best. for
we yet have not received that grace / An hou^de that ren^eth after the haar
oonly for he sees other hou^des ren^e when he is weary he rests him or
tourneth him home again But if he run for he sees the haar / he will not
spare for werynes till he have gote^ it / Right so it is ghostly / who so has
grace be it never so lityll / and leuyth wylfully the werking thereof / and
makith himself to traueyle in a another which he has not yet / oonly for he
sees or hereth that other me^ did so / sothly he may run awhyle till he
be weary / And then shall he turn home again / And but he bewaar. he may
hurt his fete by some fantasyes or that he come home But he that werkyth in
such grace as he has / and desires by prayer mekely and lastyngly after more
/ And after felyth his heart styred for to follow the grace which he desired /
he may sykerly run if he keep mekenes / And therefore desire of god as much
as thou may / without mesure or discrecy on of all that longs to his love or
to heaven bliss / For who so can most desire of god / most shall feel of him
/ But werkyth as you may: and cry god mercy for that thou may not / Thus it
semyth saint poul said / Vnusquisque habet donum suu^ a deo. p^ cor vii Ephesians.
iiii p^. cor. ir.
Alius aute^ sic: alius vero sic / Itm^ / Vnicuique nostrum data est gracia
scdm mensura^ donacionis cristi. ^tm^ Diuisiones gra^rum sunt. ^lii datur sermo
sapiencie. alii sermo scie^cie. etc / Itm^. Vt sciamus que a deo donata su^t
nobis Saint poul says that every man has his yefte of god / one thus. and a
another thus / For to every man that shall be saved is yeuen a grace after the
mesure of crystis yeft / And therefore it is spedefull that we know the yeftes
which arn yeuen us of god that we might work in hem / for by those we shall
be saved as some by bodily works: and by deeds of merci / some by great bodily
penance / some by sorrow and weeping for her sins all her life time / some by
prechyng and techyng / some by diverse graces and yeftes of deuoco^n shall be
saaf and come to bliss /

That a man should traueyle to know his owoe soul and the myghtes thereof / and
break down the ground of sin therein / Caplm xlii.
Nevertheless there is one work which is needful and spedefull to traueyle in
/ And I hope an high plain way as much as may be in man's work to
contemplaco^n / And that is a man for to enter in to himself for to knoew his
own soul / and ye myghtes thereof / The fayrnes and the towlnes of it / In
this Inward beholdynge thou shalt mow see the worship and the dignyte which
it should have by kind of the first making / And thou shall see the
wretchydnes and the myscheyf which thou art fall in for sin And of this
syghte shall come a desire with great longing in thyn heart for to recover again
that dignite and worshypp^ which thou have lost / Also thou shall feel a
lothyng and a grysyng of thyself with a great will for to distroye and bear
down thyself and all things that letten the fro that dygnyte and that Joy /
This is a ghostly traueylle hard and sharp in the beginning who so will
quyckely traueyle therein / For it is a traueyle in the soul against the ground
of all sins lytill and much. which ground is naught else but a falls
mysruled love of man to himself / Out of this love as saint austyn says
spryngeth all manner of sin dedely and venyall. And sothly until this ground
be well rasaken and deep doluyn / and as it were nere dried up by outcastyng of
al flesshly and worldly dredes and loves / a soul may never feel ghostly the
brennyng love of Ihesu christ / ne have the homlynes of his gracyous presence /
ne have clear sight of ghostly things by light of understanding / This is the
traueyle that a man behooves to draw his heart and his mind fro the flesshly
love and the likyng of all erthly creatures / fro vayn thoutes and fro fleshly
ymagynaco^ns. and out fro the love and the vicyous felyng of himself / that the
soul shall mow no rest find in no flesshly thoughts / ne erthely
affection / Then in as much as the soul may not find his ghostly rest in
the love and in the sight of Ihu^ Christ / it behouyth nedelynges suffer pain /
This traueylle is somdelyche streyte and narrow / And nevertheless I hope it is
the way which christ teched to hem y^ would be his perfyte lovers in the gospel
saying thus / Conte^dite intrare per angusta^ portam / qm^ arta est via que
ducit ad vita^. Luc. xiii^
et pauci inueniu^t ea^ / Strive ye for to enter by a strayte yate / for the
way y^ ledeth to heaven is narow and few men fyndeth it / And how streyte this
way is our lord tells in a another place thus / Si quis vult venire post me
abneget semetip^m and toliat cruce^ sua^ and sequatur me / Itm^: M^ xvi.
Qui odit ai^am sua^ in hoc mu^do / in vitam eternal custodit ea^ / That is to
say / who so will come after me / forsake himself and hate his own soul.
That is to say / Forsake all flesshly love and hate his own flesshely life /
and vain likyng of al his bodily wits for love of me And take ye cross /
That is to say / Suffer the pain of this a while / and then^e follow me /
that is to say. in contemplaco^n of my manhede and of my godhede / This is a
strayte way and a narow that no bodily thing may pass thorugh it / for it
is a sleeng of all syn^e as saint poul says / Col. iii.
Mortificate me^ bra vestra que su^t super terra^ / immu^dicia^ libidine^
concupiscencia^ malam / Slay your members upon earth / not the members of the
body but of the soul / as uncleanness lust and unskillful love to yourself and
to erthely things / Therefore as thy traueyle has been here before for to
ayensto^de bodily sins and open temptaco^ns of the enmye as it were fro
without. right so the behouyth now in this ghostly work within thyselfe for
to destroy and break the ground of syn^e in thiself asmoche as thou may / And
that thou might the more redily bring it about / I shall tell the as me
thynkyth

How a man shall know the worthiness and the worship of his soul that it had
first of / And what wretchydnes and myscheif it is fall in for sin / Caplm
xliii.
THe soul of a man is a life made of three myghtes / mind reason and will. to
the image and the liknes of the blessed trinyte / In as much as the mind was
made mighty and steadfast by the virtue of the fader almyghtihode. for to hold
him without foryetyng. distractyng or lettyng of any creature / And so it has
lyknes of the fad / The reason was made bright and clear without error or
derknes as perfytly as a soul in a body vnglorifyed might have. And so it
has the liknes of the sone / which is endless wysdom / And the love and the
will was made clean brennyng in to god without bestly love of the flesh or
of any creature by the souereyne godenes of god the holy ghost / And so it
has the lyknes of the holy ghost. which is blessid love / so that a man's
soul which may be called a made trinyte was fulfilled in mind: sight and
love of the unmade most blessed trynite which is our lord / This is the
dignyte the state and the worship of a man's soul by kind of the first
making / This state thou had in adam before the first sin of man. But when
adam sin^ed chesyng love and delight in himself and in creatures / he lost all
his worship and his dignyte. and thou also in him. and fell fro that blessed
trinyte in to a foul derke wretchyd trinyte. that is in to foryetyng of god /
and unknowing of him / and in to a bestly likynge of himself / And that
skilfully / For as david says in the sawter / Homo cu^ in honor esset no^
intellerit: co^peratus est iumentis insipientibus and silis factus est illis /
Psalm^
A man when he was in worship he knew it not / And therefore he lost it and was
made like a best / See now then^e the wretchydnes of thy soul / For as the
mind was sometime stablyd in god / right so now it has forgoten him / and
sekyth his rest in creatures: now from one to an another / and never may find
full rest / For he has lost him in whom is full rest / And right so it is
of reason / and the love also / which was clean in ghostly savor and swetnes
/ now it is tornyd in to a foul bestly lust and likyng in it self. and in
creatures / and in flesshly savors both in the wits as in gloteny and
lechery / and in ymagynyng / as in pride vaynglory and couetyse / In somoche
that thou may uneaths do any good deed / but if thou be defoyled with
vaynglory / Ne thou may not well use none of thy v. wits clenly in no
creature delectable / but if thy heart be taken and engleymed with a vein
lust and likyng of it / which puts out the love of god fro the heart as in
felyng / and the ghostly savor that it may not come therein / Every man that
lives in spirit knowith well all this This is the wretchidnes of the soul and
the mischief for ye first syn^e of man / without al other wretchydnes and
sins which thou have wylfully put thereto / And wit thou well thou thou had
never done syn^e with thy body dedely ne venyal but oonly this that is called
origynall for it is the first syn^e / and that is not else but lesyng of thy
rightfulnes which you was made in should thou never have been saved if our lord
Ihu^ christ by his precious passion had not delyuerde the and restored the again
/

How every man may be saved by the passion of christ be he never so wretched /
Caplm xliiii.
ANd therefore if thou think that I have here before spoken to hye to the. for
thou may not take it ne fulfylle it as I have said or shall say / I will now
fall down to the as low as thou will for my profit as well as for thyn
Then^e say I thus / though thou be never somoche a wretch have thou do never
somoche sin / forsake thyself and all thy works good and bad / cry mercy.
and ask only saluaco^n by virtue of this precious passion mekely and trustly
/ and without dowte thou shall have it / And fro this origynal syn^e and al
other thou shall be saaf. ye and thou shall be saaf as an anchor incluse / And not
oonly thou. but all christian souls which trusten upon this passion. and meken
hemself / knowlegynge her wretchidnes: asking mercy and foryeuenes and the
fruit of this precious passo^n oonly. lowenge hemself to the sacraments of
holy church. though it be so that they have been encombred with sin all her
life time / and never had felyng of ghostly savor or swetnes / or ghostly
knowing of god. they shallen in this faith and in her good will by virtue of
this precious passion of our lord Ihu^ christ be saaf and come to the bliss of
heaven / All this know thou well^ but yet it likes me for to say it. See
here the endless mercy of our lord how low he falls to the and to me and to al
sinful caytyfs / Then^e ask mercy and have it / Thus said the prophet in the
person of our lord. Ioh^is. ^
Ois enim quicu^que inuocauerit nomen dn^i. saluus erit Every man what y^ he be
that calls the name of god / that is to say / askith saluaco^n by Ihu^ and
his passion: he shall be saaf / This certefye of our lord some men taken well
and be^ saved thereby / and some men in trust of this mercy and this curtesye
ly^en still in her sin / and wene for to have it when hem lust / and then
mow they not. for they are taken or they were / and so they dampne hemself /
But then say thou / if this be soth then wonder I greatly for that I find
in some holy men's books / Some saye^ as I vndstonde that he that can not love
this blessed name Ihu^ ne find ne feel in it ghostly Joy and delectable with
ghostly swetnes. in the bliss of heaven he shall be alyene and never shall he
come thereto / Sothly these words when I hem red stonyed me and made me greatly
aferde / For I hope as thou say that by the mercy of our lord shall be saaf
by keeping of the commandments / and by very repentance for her evil living
before done / which felt never ghostly swetnes ne inly savor in the name of
Ihesu / And therefore I merueyle me the more that they say contrari herto as it
semyth / And unto this I may say as me thinks that her saying if it be well
vndstonde is soth / and is not contrary to that yt I have said. For this name
Ihu^ is nout else for to say upon englisshe but heler or hele / Now every man
that lives in this wretchyd life is ghostly seek / For there is no man that
lives without sin which is ghostly syknes / as saint Ioh^n says of him
self and of other perfyte men thus / Si dixerimus qr pccm^ non habemus. John.
ip^i nos seducimus et veritas in nobis no^ est / If we say that we have no
syn^e we begyle ourself. and there is no sothfastnes in us. And therefore he
may never come to the Joy of heaven unto he be first made hole of this
ghostly syckenes / But this ghostly hele may no man have that has use of
reason: but if he desire it and love it: and have delight therin^ in asmoche as
he hopith for to get it / Now the name of Ihu^ is no thing else but this
ghostly hele / wherefore it is soth that they say / that there may no man be
saaf but if he love and like in the name of Ihesu / For there may no man be
ghostly hole / but if he love and desire ghostly health / For right as if a man
were bodily seek. there were no erthly thing so dear ne so nedful to him ne
so much should be desired of him as bodily health / for though you would give
him all the richesse and worshyppes of this world and not make him hole if
thou might / thou plesest him not / Right so it is to a man that is seek
ghostly and felyth the pain of ghostly syknes / no thing is so dear ne so
needful ne so much coueyted of him as is ghostly health. and that is Ihu^ /
without which all the Joys of heaven may not like him / And this is the skille
as I hope why our lord wha^ he took mankind for our saluaco^n he would not be
called by no name that betokenid his endless being or his might or his wysdom
or his ryghtwysnes / but oonly by that ye betoke nyd the cause of his coming.
and was the saluaco^n of man's soul. which saluaco^n betokened this name
Ihu^ / Then^e by this it semyth soth that there shall no man be saaf but if he
love saluaco^n only for to have it through the mercy of our lord Ihu^^ and by
the merits of his passo^n / which love he may have that liuyth and deyeth in
the lowest degree of charytee / Also I may say on that other party that he
that can not love this blessid name Ihu^ with ghostly mirth ne increase in it
with heavenly melody here / he shall never have ne feel in heaven yt fulhede of
souereyne Joy. the which he that might in this life by abou^dance of perfect
charity in Ihu^ shall feel and have / and so may her saying be vndstonde /
Nevertheless he shall be saaf and have full mede in the sight of god / if he in
this life be in the lowest degree of charity by keeping of goddis commandments
/ For our lord says himself thus. John.
In domo patris mei mansiones multe su^t / In my faders house are many soundry
dwellynges / Some are perfyte souls the which in this life were fulfilled of
charity. and grace of the holy ghost / and song louynges to god in
conte^placion of him with wonderful swetnes and heavenly savor / Thise souls
for they had most charity and grace of the holy ghost shall have highest mede in
the bliss of heaven / for these arn called goddis derlynges / Other souls that are not disposid to conte^placo^n of god. ne had not the fulhede of charity. as
apostles and marters had in the beginning of holy church. shall have lower mede
in the bliss of heaven / for thise arne called goddis friends / Thus calls
our lord in holy writ chosen souls saying thus / Comedite amici. et
inebriamini ca^issimi / My friends ete ye. Cant
and my derlynges be ye dronken / As if our lord said thus / ye that arne my
trendes. for ye kept my commandments. and set my love before the love of
ye world / and loved me more tha^ any erthly thing ye shall be fed with
ghostly fode of the bread of life / But ye yt arne my friends that ye not oonly

That a man should be besye to reken again his worthynes / and refourme again in

Nevertheless though this be soth of the endless merci of god unto the and to me

wylfully in our lyuinge / but the more besye for to pleyse him / namly now
sythen we are restored again in hope by the passion of our lord to the dignyte
and the bliss which we had lost by adams syn^e / And though we might never
get it fully here / yet we should desire that we might recover here living a
figure and a lyknes of ye dignytee that our soul might be reformed as it were
in a shadow by grace to the image of the trynite / which we had by kynde^ and
after shall have fully in bliss / for that is the life which is very
contemplatyf unto begin here in that feeling of love. and ghostly knowing of
god by opening of the ghostly eye which shall never be lost ne be taken away.
but ye same shall be fulfilled otherwise in ye bliss of heaven / This behyght
our lord to mary mawdeleyne which was contemplatif / and said thus of her /
Maria optima^ parte^ elegit que no^ auferetur ab ea^ ^
That mary had chose the better party that is the love of god in contemplaco^n

living recover so hole ne so perfyte clen^es and Innocence knowing and
louinge of god as thou hadest first. ne as thou shall have / ne you may not
escape all ye wretchydnes and pains of syn^e / ne thou living in dedely
flesh may destroy and quench all holy the false vain love in thyselfe /
ne flee all venyall sins that they ne will but if they be stopped by great
fervor of charity spring out of thyn heart as water does fro a stynkyng well
/ But I would that if thou might not fully quench it. that you might somewhat
sleke it. and come to the cle^nes of soul as nere as thou may / For our
lord behite the children of Israel wha^ he ladde hem in to the land of byhest

How Ihesu shall be sought. desired: and found / ca xlvi
Seek then that thou have lost that thou might find it / well I wot who
so might ones have an inward syghte a lityll of that dignytee and that
ghostly fayrnes which a soul had by kind. and shall have by grace / he
should loathe and despise in his heart all the bliss. the likyng: and the
fayrnes of this world as the stenche of a carrion. and he shall never have will
for to do other deed night and day saving the freelte and the bare need of
the bodily kind but desire. mourn. and pray and seek how he might come again
thereto / Nevertheless in as much as thou have not yet seen what it is fully /
For thy ghostly eye is not yet opened / I shall tell the oo word for all in
the which thou shall seek desire and find it. for in that one word is all
that thou have lost / This word is Ihesu / I mean not this word Ihesu
painted upon ye wall / or written by lettres on the book. or fourmyd by lips
in sou^de of the mowthe / or feyned in thy heart by traueyle of thy mind / For
in this manner wise may a man out of charity find him. But I mean Ihesu
crist that blessid person god and man sone of virgin mary / whom this name
betokenith that is all goodness: endless wysdom / love / and swetnes / thy Joy.
thy worship. and thyn everlasting bliss / thy god: thy lord. and thy
salvation / Then if it be so that thou felyst a great desire in thyn heart
to Ihesu. either by mind of this name Ihesu. or by mind and saying of any
other word / or in prayer. or in any deed yt thou do / which desire is so
much that it puts out as it were by strength al other thoughts and
desires of the world / and of the flesh that they may not rest in thine
heart / Then sechest thou well thy lord Ihesu And when thou felyst this
desire to god / to Ihesu. all is one helped and comforted by a ghostly might /
in somoche that it is turned in to love and affecco^n / ghostly savor and
swetnes / In to light and knowing of sothfastnes / somoche that for the time
the point of thy thought is set upon no thing that is made / Ne it felyth
no stiryng of vaynglory ne of itself another / ne none other evil affecco^n /
for they mow not appear that time / But oonly is enclosed. rested: softed.
enoynted in Ihesu / then have thou found somewhat of Ihesu / Not him as he
is. but a shadow of him. For the better that thou fyndest him / the more shall
thou desire him / Then by what manner prayer or meditaco^n or occupaco^n that
thou may have grettest and clennest desire to him. and have most feeling of
him / by that ocupacyon thou sechest him best and best fyndest him / Therefore
if it come to thy mind / as it were asking what have thou lost / and what
sechest thou Lift up thy mind and the desire of thy heart to Ihesu christ
though thou be blind and naught may see of his godhede And say that him
have thou lost / and him would thou have. and no thing but him / to be with
him where he is / None other joy none other bliss in heaven ne in earth but him
/ And though it be so that thou feel him in deuoco^n or in knowinge / or in
any other yefte what that it be / rest not there as though thou had fully
found Ihesu. But foryete that. that you have found / and always by desiryng
after Ihesu more and more for to find him better / as though thou had
right naught found in him / For wit thou well what that thou felyst of him.
be it never so much. ye though thou were rauisshed in to the third heaven
with poul / yet have thou not found Ihesu as he is in his Joy / Know thou or
feel thou never so much of him / he is yet above it / And therefore if thou
woll fully find him as he is in the bliss / of loving cease you never while
thou lyuest / ne of ghostly desyryng /

What profit it is to have the desire of Ihesu / Caplm xlvii.
SOthly I had lever feel and have a sothfaste desire and a clean in mine heart
to my lord Ihesu christ / though I see right lityll of him with my ghostly eye
than for to have without this desire all bodily penance of all men living /
all vysions or reuelaco^ns of angels apperyng / songs and so wnynges. savors
and smelles. bren^ynges. and any likings or bodily felynges / And shortly for
to say. or all the Joy of heaven and of earth which I might have without
this desire to my lord Ihesu / Dauyd the prophet felt as I say as I
vndstonde when he sayd^ thus / P^ lxxii.
Quid enim michi est in celo et a te quid volui super terram / Lord what
thing is to me in heaven / or what would I without the above earth / As if he
had said thus / Lord Ihesu what heavenly Joy is likynge to me without desire
of the whiles I am in earth / or without love of the when I come to heaven / As
who say: right none. Then if thou will feel any thing of him bodily or
ghostly / coueyte not but for to feel sothfastly a desire of his grace and of
his mercyful presence: that the thinks that thyn heart may find none other
rest in no thing but in him / Thus coueyted dauyd when he said thus / P^
Concupiuit anima mea desiderare iustificaco^nes tuas in om^i tempore / Lord
my soul coueyted the desire of thy rightwysnes in every time / Seek then as
dauyd did desire by desire / And if thou may feel by thy desire in prayers
and in meditaco^ns the homely presence of Ihesu christ in thy soul / bind thyn
heart fast thereto that it fall not therfro. And if thou stomble^ that thou may
soon find him again /

Where and with what thing Ihesu shall be sought and found / Caplm xliii.
Seek then Ihesu whom thou have lost / He will be sought / and he may then
somewhat be founden / for he says himself / Omnis qui querit inueniet / Every
man that sechyth shall find / The sekyng is traueylous. but the finding is
blysfull / Do therefore after the counseylle of the wise man if thou will find
him / Si quesieris quasi pecunia^ sapienciam and sicut thesaurum effoderis
illam: prouer, xx.
tunc intelliges timorem dn^i and sciencia^ inuenies / If thou seek wysdom the
which is Ihesu as silver and gold and delueste deep thereafter thou shall
find it / The behouyth for to delue deep in thyn heart. for therein he is hid
/ and cast out full clenly all loves and likings sorrows and dredes of all
erthly things / and so shall thou find wysdom Ihesu / Be thou then like to
the woman of the gospel of the which our lord says thus / Que mulier
habens dragmas december. (...)
etc^ what woman is that. that has lost a drame that she ne will light a
lantem and cast her house vpsodowne and seche till she find it / As who say
none. And when she has founden it she calls her friends and says to hem
thus / Makyth mirth with me and melody. for I have founden the drame that I
had lost / This drame is Ihesu that thou have lost / And if thou will find
him / light up a latern that is goddis word as david says / ^s. cxviii
Lucerna pedibus meis verbu^ tuu^ / Lord thy word to my fete is a lantern /
Bithys lantern shalt thou see where he is and how thou shalt find him / And
if thou wylt thou may with this light up an other latern: that is the reason
of thy soul / For as our lord says / Lucerna corporis tui est oculus tuus.
The laterne of thy body is thy bodily eye / Right so may be said that the
lantern of thy soul is reason. by the which the soul may see all ghostly
things / By this lantern may thou find Ihu^ and that is soth if thou hold up
the lantern fro vndneth the busshell. Luc. 10.
as our lord says / Nemo accendit lucernam and ponit eam sub modio sed super
candelabru^ / There is no man that lyghteth a lantern for to set it under a
busshell but upon a candelstycke / That is to say / Thy reason shall not be
ouerlayd with erthly besynes ne vain thoughts and erthly affeccyons but aye
upward above all vain thought and erthly things as much as thou may / And
if thou do so thou shall see then all the molle and all the fylthe and
small motes in thy house / for why he is light / That is to say all flesshly
loves and dredes in thy soul / Not all^ P^ xxiiii
for as dauyd said / Delicta quis intelliget / who may know al his trespasses /
As who say no man / And thou shall cast out of thyn heart all such sins and
swepe thy soul clean with the besome of the dread of god / and with the water
of thyn eyes wasshe it. and so shall thou find thy drame Ihesu / He is drame
he is penny. he is thine heritage / This drame will not be founden so lightly
as it is said / for this work is not of one hour ne of one day / but many
days and years / with much sweet and swynke of body and traueylle of the
soul / And if thou cease not but seche besily. sorrow and syghe deep / mourn
stylly. and stowpe low till thyn eyes watren for anguysshe and for pain for
you have lost thy tresour Ihu^. at the last when he will well shall thou find
thy drame Ihesu / And if thou find him as I have said. that is if thou may in
clennes of conscience feel ye homely and the peesfull presence of that blessed
man Ihesu christ as a shadow or a glemeryng of him / Thou may if thou will
call all thy fre^des to the for to make mirth with the and melodye for thou
have founden the* drame Ihesu /

Where Ihesu is lost and founden again thorugh his mercy / Caplm xlix
SEe now then^e the curtesye and the mercy of Ihu^. you have lost him. but
where? Sothly in thy house / that is in thy soul That is to say / if thou
had lost all the reason of thy soul by the first sin thy soul should
never have found him again / but he left to the thy reason. and so he is in
thy soul / and never shall be lost out of it / Nevertheless thou art never
the nerer to him till thou have found him / He is in the though he be lost fro
the / But thou art not in him till thou have found him / Then was this his
mercy that he would suffer him to be lost oonly where he may be found / It
needs not to run to Rome ne to Iherusalem for to seche him there / but
turn thy thought in to thine own soul where he is hid. as the prophet
says / Vere tu es deus absconditus Sothly lord thou art an hid god / and
seche him there. M^ 13.
Thus says himself in the gospel / Simile est regnu^ celorum thesauro
abscondito in agro. quem qui inuenit homo abscondit and pre gaudio illius
vadit^ and vendit vniuersa que habet. et emit agrum illu^ / The kingdom of
heaven is likened to a tresoure hyd in the field. the which when a man fyndeth
for Joy of it he gooth and sells all that he has and byeth the field /
Ihesu is tresour hid in thy soul / Then if thou might find him in thy
soul. and thy soul in him / I am syker for Joy of it thou would give the
likyng of all erthly thing for to have it / Ihesu slepith in thy heart ghostly^
as he did sometime bodily when he was in the ship with his discyples But they
for dread of perysshynge wakened him. and soon after he saved hem fro tempeste
/ Do thou so. styre him by prayer / and wake him with great cryenge of desire
/ and he shall soon rise and help the /

What lets a man to here and see Ihesu within him self / Caplm L.
Nevertheless I hope better that thou slepest ofter to him than he does to the
/ For he callyth the full often with his sweet pryue voys / and styreth thyn
heart full stylly yt thou sholdest leave all other Ianglyng of al other vanitees
in thy soul / and oonly take keep of him for to here him speak Thus says
Dauyd of our lord / Audi filia and vide et inclina aurem tuam and obliuiscere
populum tuum and domum patris tui / My daughter here and see and bow thine ere
to me. and foryete the folk of thy worldly thoughts. and the housse of thy
flesshly and kyndely affeccyons / Loo here may thou see how our lord callyth
the and all other which wyile harken to him / what lettyth the then^e that
thou may another see him ne here him / Sothly there is so much dynne and
cryenge in thine heart of vain thoughts and flesshly desires that you may
another here him ne see him / Therefore put away unrestful dynne. and break the
love of sin and of vanytee / and bring in to thine heart love of virtues and
full charity. and then shall thou here thy lord speak to the /

That mekenes and charity ben the special lyuerey of Ihesu / through the which
man's soul is reformed to the lyknes of him / Caplm li.
AS long as Ihesu fyndeth not his image reformed in the. he is strange and
the ferther fro the / For thy shape the for to be arrayed in his liknes / that
is in mekenes and charity / the which arn his lyuereys / And then will he
homelyche know the / and show to the his pryuetees / Thus said he himself to
his disciples / John xiiii
Qui diligit me diligetur a patre meo et manifestabo ei meip^m / who so loves
me he shall be loved of my fader and I shall show myself unto him There is no
virtue ne no work that thou may do that may make the like to our lord
without mekenes and charity / for these two arn specially to god most leyf /
And that semyth well in the gospel where our lord spekyth of mekenes thus /
Discite a me quia mitis sum and humilis cord / M. ii.
Learn of me he said not for to goo bare foot ne for to goo in to Deserte / and
there for to fast forty days / ne yet also for to chese you dyscyples / But
learn of me mekenes / for I if you drew in to thyself thy heart thou sholdest
not find naught / but thou sholdest find Ihesu / Not oonly the naked mind
of this name. but thou sholdest tynde Ihesu christ in conscience redely techyng
the / Thou sholdest find light of understanding: and no derknes of vncu^nyng
/ Thou sholdest find love and likyng of him. and no pain of bitterness and
heaviness / But for thou art not reformed therefore when thy soul comes in fro
all bodily things. and fyndeth naught but derkenes and heaviness / him thinks
an hundred winter to he be out again by some bodily delight or vayn thought. and
that is no wonder / For who so comyth home until his house and fyndeth no
thing therein but stynke and smoke. and a chidyng wife he would soon run out
of it / Right so thy soul when it tyndeth no comfort in it self but black
smoke of ghostly blyndnes. and great chidyng of flesshly thoughts cryeng up on
the that thou may not be in peace / sothly it is soon weri till it be out again
/ This is the derknes of conscience /

Who so will find Ihesu him behouith abidyngly to traueyle in ghostly
derkenes against the image of sin / Caplm liiii^
Nevertheless in this derke conscience behooves the to swinke and sweet / That
is to say / The behouith to draw in to thyself thy thought fro all bodily
things as much as thou may / And then when thou fyndest right naught but
sorrow and pain. and blyndnes in this derknes / if thou will find Ihesu the
pain of this derke conscience the behouyth suffer. and abide awhyle therein /
And here the behooves to be waar that thou take Ihesu christ in thy thought
against this each derkenes in thy mind / And by besye prayer and fervent desire
to god / Not setting the point of thy thought in that foresaid naught / but
in Ihesu christ which thou desyrest / Think styfly on the passion and on his
mekenes and thorugh might of him thou shall arise / Do as thou would bear
it down and goo through it / Thou shall agryse and loathe this derkenes. and
this naught right as the devil: and thou shall despise it and al to breast it
/ For all within this naught is Ihu^ hid in his Joy whom thou may not find
by thy sechyng / but if thou pass the derknes of this conscience. This is the
ghostly traueyle that I speak of / And this traueile is cause of all this
writing / for to styre the thereto if thou feel grace / This derkenes of
conscience and this naught that I speak of is the image of the first adam /
Saint poul knew it well / for he said thus of it / Sicut portauimus ymagine^
terreni hominis. Cor^ (...)
ita portemus ymagine^ iam and celestis / As we have here before borne the
image of the erthly man that is the first adam / right so that we might now
bear the image of the heavenly man which is Ihesu the second adam / He bare
this image often full heavy / for it was so comberous to him that he cried out on
it layeng thus / O quis liberabit me de corpore mortis huius / O who shall
deliver me fro this body and this image of death / And then he comforted
himself and other also thus / Gracia dei per ih^m xp^m / To. (...)
The grace of god by Ihesu christ /

What is propirly the image of sin / and what comyth out thereof / Caplm lv
NOw have I told the a lityll of this image how it is naught / Nevertheless if
it be fer fro thy knowing how it might be an image / for naught is but naught.
but so might you not litly vndstonde it. I shall tell ye more openly of this
image as me thinks / This image is a falls mysruled love unto thyself / Out
fro this comen all manner of sins by seven Ryuers / which arne these / Pride.
Envy. Ire. Accidie. Couetise. Glotenye. and Lechery / Loo this is somewhat
that thou may feel / By one of these ryuers ren^eth out al manner of syn^e and
puts the out of charity if it be dedely syn^e / or it lets the fervor
of charity if it be venyall / ^ow may you grope that this image is not naught /
but it is much of bad for it is a great spring of love unto thyself with
such vii ryuers as I have said / But now say thou how may this be soth / I
have forsaken the world / and I am stoken in an house / I meddle with no man /
I chyde not / I strive not / I neither bye ne selle / I ne have no worldly
besynes but by the mercy of god / I keep me chaste and wythholde me fro delytes
/ And over this I pray I wake / I traueyle bodily and ghostly as I may / How
should then this image be so much in me as thou spekest of / As to this I
answer and grant to the / that I hope thou do all thise works and moo
thereto* and yet may it be soth as I say / Thou art besye upon thy might for to
stop the ryuers wythoute^ / but the spring within on hap you leuest hole /
Thou art like to a man the which had in his yerde a stinkyng well with many
rennynges fro it. He yede and he stopped the rennynges and left the spring
hole / and we^de all had be syker / but the water sprange up at the ground of
the well / and stood stylle somoche that it corrupted all the fayrnes of his
garden / and yet ren^eth no water out / ^yght so may it be with the / If it
be so that thou have by grace stopped the ryuers of this image without /
somoche it is well / but be ware of the spring within / Sothly but if thou
stop and cleanse that as much as thou may it will corrupt all ye flowers of
the gardyne of thy soul / show they never so fair outward in syghte of men /
But now say you. whereby shall I know that the ground is stopped / if I
traueylle about it / As unto this I shall tell by assaye how thou shalt
know this image if it be in the / and how much it is in ye and thereby shall
thou wit how much it is stopped and how lityl also in the / And asmoche as
pride is the pryncipall River I shall tell the thereof first /

What pride is / And when it is sin Caplm lvi*
Pride is not else as clerks saye^ but love of thyn own excellence. yt is of
thyn own worship / Then^e the more thou love and likest in thyn own
worship. the more is the pride / and so the more is the image in the / If thou
feel in thyn heart a stiryng of pride / thou that art holyer. Wyser better*
and more virtuous than a another is / that god has yeuen the grace for to serve
him better than other done / and thou thynkest al other byneth the and the
abouen hem / or any other thought of thiself / which shows to thy sight of
thy soul an excellence and an ouerpassynge of other men or wym^en / and of
this stiryng thou felyst love and delight and vayn plesyng in thyself that thou
art so / this is a token that thou berest this black image / which if it be
pryue fro men's eyes. nevertheless it shows him openly in goddis syghte / But
now say thou that thou may not flee such styringes of pride / for often thou
felist hem against thy will. and therefore thou hold hem no sin / or if
they ben syn^e they ben naught but venyall / As to this I say thus that the
felyng of these stirynges of pride or of any other the which spryngen out
either of the corrupco^n of this foul image or by incastyng of the enmye. it
is no sin in as much as thou felyst hem / and that is a grace and a
pryuylege by virtue of the passion of Ihesu christ granted to all cryste^ men
baptized in water and in the holy ghost / For sothly to Jews and sarrazyns
which trow not in Ihesu christ. all such stirynges are dedely sins / For
saint poul says. Om^e quod non est ex fide pccm^ est / All that is done
withouten truth in christ is dedely sin / But we christian men have this
pryuilege of his mercy that such felynges are no syn^e. but they are pain of
the oryginall sin / Nevertheless when by neclygence and by blyndenes of
thiself this felyng is received unwarily in thy thought. and turned in to love
and likynge / then is there sin more or less after the mesure of the love
/ sometime venyall. and sometime dedely / when it is venyall and when dedely /
fully can I not tell the / Nevertheless a lityll I shall say as me thinks /

When pride is dedely sin. And how it is in flesshely living men dedely sin
/ Caplm lvii^
THen^e the stirynge of pride is received and turned in to lykyng somoche that
the heart cheseth it for a full rest and a full delight. and secheth none other
end but oonly likyng therein / then^e is this pride dedely syn^e / for he
makith and chesyth this delight as his god without ayenstondyng of reason and of
will and therefore it is dedely sin / But now say thou / what fool is he
that would chese pride as his god / no man that lives would do so / As unto
this I say that I can not tell the in specyal who syn^eth in pride dedely /
but in general I shall say yt There is two manner of pride / The tone is bodily
pride. the other is ghostly pride / Bodily pride is of flesshly living men.
Ghostly pride is of ypocrytes and heretykes / These three syn^e dedely in pride
/ I mean of such a flesshly living man as saint poul spekith of thus / Si
scdm carne^ vixeritis moriemini / If ye live after your flesh ye shall deye /
Then say I thus that a worldely man which loves and sechyth pryncypally
the worship of himself / and chesyth the likynge of it / as rest of his heart
and the end of his bliss he syn^eth dedely / But now say thou / who would
chese love of his worshypp^ instead of his god / As to this I say thus / that
he that loves his worship as for to seem better and gretter of astate tha^ any
other / and traueyleth about it as much as he may if he love it somoche that
for ye getyng of it ye keeping and the saving of it he brekith the commandment
of god: or brekith love and charity to his even christian. or is ready and in full
will for to break it rather than he should forbere his worship. or lose it
either of his name or of his state / or of fulfillyng of his will: sothly he
syn^eth dedely / For he louyth his worshypp^ and chesyth it more than the love
of god and of his even cryste^ / And nevertheless the man that synneth thus
dedely he would say with his mouth that he will not chese pride for his god /
But he begileth himself for he chesyth it by his deed / Nevertheless a another
worldly man that louith worship of himself. and pursues thereafter if he love
it not so much that he would for the getyng or ye saving of it do a dedely
syn^e or break charity to his even christian / he synneth not dedely but venyall
/ more or less after the mesure of his love and his likynge with other
cyrcumstaunces /

How pride in heretykes is dedely syn^e / Caplm lviii
AN heretyke synneth dedely in pride. for he chesyth his rest and his delight
in his own opinyon and in his own saying / for he weneth that it is soth /
which opinyon or saying is against god and holy church / and therefore synneth
he in pride dedely for he louyth himself and his own will and wit so much
that though it be openly against the ordinance of holy church he will not leave
it but rest him therein as in sothfasnes* and so makyth he it his god / but he
begyleth himself / For god and holy church arn so onyd and acorded together
yt who so does against that one he does against both / And therefore he that
says he louyth god and kepith his biddynges / and dispiseth holy church. and
sets at naught the laws and the ordinances of it made by the head and the
sovereign in governance of all christian men / he lies he chesyth not god. but
he chesyth the love of himself contrary to the love of god / and so he
synneth dedely / And in that he weneth most to pleyse god he most dysplesyth
him / for he is blind and will not see / Of this blyndnes and this false
resting of an heretyke in his own felyng spekith the wise man thus / Est via
que videtur homini recta / et nouissima eius ducu^t ad mortem. pro^^. xiiii
There is a way which semyth to a man ryghtfull / and the last end of it
brings him to endless death / This way specially is called heresye / For
other flesshly sinners that syn^en dedely and lain therein comynly they suppose
amys of hemself. and felen bityng in conscience that they goo not in the right
way But an heretyke supposes that he does well and techeth well and yet no
man so well / And so weneth he that his way were the right way / and
therefore felyth he no bityng of conscience ne mekenes in heart / And sothly
but if god send him mekenes of his mercy. at the last end he gooth to hell
/ And nevertheless yet weneth he for to have done well and gete^ him the bliss
of heaven for his techyng /

How pride in ypocrytes is dedely sin / Caplm lix.
THe ypocryte also synneth dedely in pride / He is an ypocrite that cheseth
vain Joy of himself. as the rest and ye full delight of heart upon this manner
of wise / when a man does many manner of good deeds bodily and ghostly and
then^e is put to his mind by suggesto^n of the enmye beholding of himself and
of his good deeds / How good how holy he is how worthy in men's dome / and
how high in goddis syghte aboue^ other men. he perceyueth this stiryng and
receives it wylfully / for he weneth it be good and of god in as much as it
is soth for he does these good deeds better than other me^ And when it is
received thus by assent of his will as good year ryseth of it alone and a
delight in his heart of himself yt he so much grace has that it rauyssheth
his mind out of all other thoughts both ghostly and flesshly for the time
and settyth it in vain Joy of himself as in a rest of his heart / This
rauysshyng in ghostly pride is delectable / and therefore he kepyth it holds
it and noryssheth it as much as he may For this love and vain delight he
prays and waketh. he fasteth and wereth the hair / and does other
afflycco^ns. and all this greueth him but lityll / He loves he thanketh god
sometime with his mouth / and sometime wryngeth a tere out of his eye: and
then he thinks all saaf enough / But sothly all this is for love of
himself which he cheseth and receives as it were love and Joy in god / and
in that is all the sin / He chesyth not sin wylfully as for sin / but he
che^yth this delight and Joy that he felyth for god / as the rest of his soul
the which is sin wythouten displesyng or again stondyng of will / For he
weneth it were a Joy in god / and it is not so. and therefore synneth he
dedely / Job says thus of an ypocrite / Gaudium ypocrite ad instar pu^cti / Si
ascenderit in celum superbia eius and capud eius nubes tetigerit. Job. 20^
velut sterquiliniu^ in fine perdetur / The Joy of an ypocryte is no more
than a point / For if he stye in to heaven with reysynge of heart / and his
heued touch the skies at the last end he shall be casten out as a dounge hepe
/ The Joy of an ypocryte is but a point / For if he worship himself never
so much. and Joy in himself never so much al his life time / and depeynte
himself with all his good deeds in syghte and in loving of the world / at the
last it is right naught / but sorrow and pain / But now say* thou that there
are few such or else none that is so blind that would hold and chese vain
Joy in himself as for Joy in god / As unto this I can not say ne will not
though I cowde / but one thing I tell that there are many ypocrytes / and
nevertheless they wene that they be^ none / and that be many that drede^ hemself
as ypocrites. and sothly they are none / which is one and which is other god
knows / and none but he / who so will mekely dread* he shall not be bigyled
/ And who so weneth to be syker. he may lightly fall / For saint poul says /
Qui se existimat aliquid esse cum nichil sit. Gal. ^.
ipse se seducit / who so weneth himself to be ought when he is right naught
/ he begyleth himself /

How stirynges of pride and vainglory in good men be^ but venial sins /
Caplm lx
Nevertheless a man or woman which disposyth him to live contemplatyf / if it
be so that he forsake him self as in will / and offer him holy to god with a
full general will that he would not sin in pride wyttyngly: ne have Joy in
himself wylfully but oonly in god if he cowde and might / And after this full
will offered to god he felyth many stirynges of vaynglory / and delyteth in hem
for the time for he perceyueth hem not. This likyng is but venyall sin and
namly if it be so that when he comyth to himself he repreuyth himself and
ayenstondeth this stiryng with displesyng of will / and askyth mercy and help
of god / Then the likyng which before was sin / out lord of his mercy
soon forgyueth it / And yet he shall have mede for his good traueyle in the
ayenstondyng / And that is a curtesye of our lord granted to all those
which arn specially his servants and more homely of his court / as are all
those that for his love forsaken in a good true will all worldly and al
flesshly sin / and yeuen hem holy body and soul unto his seruyse in her
might and her cunning / As done pryncypally ancres encluse and true religyous
/ the which for the love of god and salvation of her souls entren in to any
religyon approved by holy church / Or else if it be so that they entren
first for a worldly cause as for her bodily sustenaunce / or for some other
such / if they repent hem and turn it in to a goostly cause as for the
service of god / These as long as they keep this will and pursue it as they
may upon her freelte are true religyous / Also what man or woman that he be in
what degree he be in holy church priest clerk or lewd man / wydowe or maiden
or wife that will for the love of god and salvation of his soul forsake all the
worshyppes and likings of this world in this world in his heart truly and
fully betwix god and him and all wylful besynes and erthly things to the bare
need / And offer his wyll^nteerly for to be his servant upon his might by
devout prayers and holy thoughts. with other good deeds that he may do
bodily and goostly and kepyth his will hoole to god steadfastly / All these arne
specially goddis servants in holy church / And for this good will and good
pourpoos that they have of the yefte of god they shall encrese in grace and in
charity here living / And they shall have for this special will a special
mede in the bliss of heaven before other chosen souls which offered not holy
her will and her bodi to goddis service / neither openly ne pryuely as they
dyden / All these which I call goddis servants and of his court more
special / if they by freelte and by vnkunnyng when they feel such stirynges
of vaynglory for the time delyten therein / and perceyuen it not for her reason
and her wit is let by the likynge that they feel that it may not see this
stirynge / They sin not dedely in this likynge of vain glory / For that will
that they have generally set in her heart before to plese god / and for to
forsake all manner of sin if they knew it kepith hem here in such stirynges
and in all other that comen of freelte that they sin not dedely / And shall
keep as long as the ground of that will is kept hole /

How diverse states in holy church shall have diverse medes in heaven / And of
two special medes in heaven / Caplm lxi.
ANd over this I say more in comfort of the and of all other having the state
of anchor incluse. and also by grace o^ god in comfort of hem all that enter
any religyon approved in holy church / that all those that by the mercy of
our lord shall be saaf they shall have a special mede and a synguler worship
in the bliss of heaven for her state of living before other souls that had
not that state in holy church though they ben never so holy / which worship
is better than all the worship of this world wythouten comparyson / For if
thou might see what it were thou would not for ye worship of this world if
thou myghtest have it withouten syn^e change the state either of anchor or of
religyous. ne lose that synguler mede in the bliss of heaven / which mede is
called Accydentall mede / Nevertheless that other men mystake not this that I
say / Therefore I shall say it more openly / Thou shall understand that there
are two medes in the bliss of heaven / which our lord gives to chosen
souls / The tone is souereyne and pryncypall / As is loving and knowing of
him after the mesure of charytee given of god to a soul living in dedely
flesh / This mede is best and souereyne for it is god himself / And it is
common to all the souls that shollen be saaf in what state or degree that they
ben living in holy church more or less / after the quantyte and the mochenes
of her charity in his life what degree he be in. For he that most loves god
in charity / he shall have most mede in the bliss of heaven / For he shall
most love god and know him and that is the souereyne mede / And as for this
mede it shall fall that some manner of man or woman / as a lord or a lady /
knight / or squire / marchaunte / or plough man^ or what degree he be in man
or woman shall have more mede thann some priest / or friar / monk / or chanon
/ or anchor incluse / And why? Soothly for he loved god more in charity / An
other mede there is / that is secundary which our lord gives for special
good deeds that a man does wylfully over that he is bounden to / Of three deeds
pryncypall doctors of holy church maken mind / Of marterdome. prechynge. and
manhood / These three works as for an excellence in as much as they passen all
other shull have special mede which they callen aureole. And that is naught
else but a synguler worship and special token ordained of god in reward of
that special deed before other men / that did not so over the souereyne mede
of love of god / ^hyche is common to him and to all other / Right so it is of
al other special good deeds / the which if they ben done soothfastly arne
specially acceptable to the syghte of god / and in the dome of holy church
they arne excellent / As arne enclosynge of ankers done by the auctoryte of
holy church / Also entering in to any religyon approved. And the streyghter
that the relygion is the more excellent is the deed in the dome of holy church
/

Also after these and byneth these the taking of the order of priest either
for cure of men's souls / and for to mynister the sacraments of holy church
/ Or else for synguler devotion to pleyse god and profyten her even christian by
the sacryfyse of the precious body of our lord Ihesu christ / Sothly they arne
special deeds / and excellent openly showed in the dome of holy church / and
in the syghte of our lord / wha^ they arne done sothfastly for god they arne
excellent / and they shullen have special mede each man in his degree in the
bliss of heaven / The state of bishop and prelate is abouen all these deeds
as for this accydentall mede / That this is soth it s^ myth by holy writ
where it says thus in the prophet Danyel / Tu autem vade ad tempus prefinitum
et requiesces ^t stabis in sort tua in fine dierum / This is for to say thus
much / The angel when he had showed to Danyel the pryuytees of god he said to
him thus / Goo thou to the rest of thy bodily death / and thou shalt stand
in thy sort as a prophet at the last day / And sothly as Danyell shall
stand as a prophet at the last day of dome and have the worship and the
excellence of a prophet over the souereyn blessed mede of love and sight of
god / Right so shalt thou stand as an anchor in that sort / and a religyous
in the sort of relygyon And so of other excellent deeds / and have a synguler
worship passing other men at the day of dome /

A short stirynge to mekenes and to charytee / Caplm lxii.
NOw by these words thou may if thou wolte trow hem / conceive comfort for
thy degree of living / and also matere of mekenes / For though it be so that
thou shalt have so much mede specially for thy state of living if you be saaf
/ Nevertheless it may be that there is many a wife and many worldlyche woman
shall be nerer god than thou / and more shall love god and better know him
than thou shall: for all thy state / And that ought to be a shame for the but
if thou be bisye for to get love and charity as fully and as perfytly as a
worldely man or woman / For if thou may have as much charytee of the gift of
god as he or she has that dwellyth stylle in worldly besynes / thou shall
have as much of the souereyn mede as he shall. And you shall over that for that
state which thou have taken have a singular mede and a worship which he shall
not have / Then^e if thou will do well meke thyselfe and forgete thy state as
it were right naught For it is soth. by it self it is right naught / And
that thy desire be and thy besynes for to destroy sins / and for to get
charity and mekenes and other ghostly virtues / for therein lies al /

How a man shall know how much pride is in him / Caplm lxiii.
I Have nyghe forgoten this image / But now I turn again thereto / if thou will
wite how much pride is therein / Thou may yet assaye thyself thus / Look now
wisely / and flater not thyself / if loving praysynge or worshypping. or
flesshly favor of worldly men or of other be likynge to thine hert^ and torn
it to vain gladness and well payeng of thiselfe / Think stylly in thine heart
that men sholden praise thy life / reward thy speech more than of other / And
also on contrary wise / if it be so that men repreue the / and setten the at
naught / Hold the but a fool or an ypocryte / or if they sclau^der the. or
speak evil of the falsely / or in any other way that they disease the
vnskylfully / And for thy thou felyst in thine heart a grievous heaviness against
hem / and a great rysyng in thine heart with ayenstondyng for to suffer any
shame or vylanye in the syghte of the world / If it be thus with the it is a
toke^ that there is much pride in this derke image seem thou never so holy in
the syghte of men / For though these stirynges ben not but lityll and venyall /
nevertheless they shown well that there is much pride hid in the ground of
thine heart / as the fore dares in his den / These styrynges with many moo
^^^^ngen out of this image so much that thou may uneaths do any good deed
but it shall be meddled with some pride or vain delight in thyself / And so
with thy pride thou defowlest all thy good deeds / and makyth hem loothsom in
the syghte of thy lord / I say not that they are lost. for they are meddled
with this pride / But I say that they are not so pleysaunt to thy lord as
they should be if they were simple and truly roted in the virtue of mekenes /
And therefore if thou will have clennes of heart. for to come to the love of
god / the behooves not oonly flee the rest of thin heart in vain glory by
wylfull assentyng to pride / and also the recheles ^ykyng therein of thy freelte
if it be against thy will / But also the feeling of thy pride thou shall flee
and eschew as much as thou may / But that thou may not do but if thou be
full quycke and ready abowte the keeping of thine heart / as I shall tell after
/

Of Envy and ire and of her branches / And how instead of sin man^is
person is often hated / Caplm lxiiii
Turn this image up so wwne / And look well therein. and thou shalt find two
members of envy and ire fastenyd thereto / with many diverse branches spryngyng
out of them / The which letten love and charity / the which thou sholdest
have to thyn even christian / The branches of ire and envy are these / Hatrede.
evil suspecion / falls and unskillful demynge / malecolye risyng of heart
against hem / dyspisyng and unkindness. and bachityng: and myssayenge /
unskillful blamyng / myslikyng. anguisshe. and heaviness aye^ste hem that
dispisen the or speak any evil of the^ or against ye A gladness of her disese /
a felnes against synful men and other that will not do as the thinks they
should do with great desire of thine heart under color of charity and
ryghtwysnesse that they were well punysshed and chastysed for her sin / This
stiryng semyth good / Nevertheless if you ransake it well thou shall find it
more sometime flesshly against the person than ghostly against the syn^e / Thou
shall love the man be he never so sinful / and thou shall hate the sin in
each man what he be / Many are begyled in this / for they set the bitter instead of the sweet. and taken derknes in the stead of light against the
prophet saying / Ve vobis que dicitis malu^ bonu^ and bonum malu^ ponentes
lucem tenebras and amaru^ dulce. ^say^ ^.
woo be to hem that sayen good is evil and evil is good and setten light as
derknes. and bitter instead of sweet. Thus done all tho that when they should
hate the sin of her even christian. and love the person / they hate the
person instead of the sin. and wene that they hate the sin / wherefore it
is a craft by it self who so cowde do it well /

That it is maystry to love men's persons and wisely hate her sins / Caplm
lxv
IT is no maystry for to wake and fast till thyn head ache. ne for to run to
Rome and to Iherusalem upon thy thy bare fete / ne for to sterte about and
preche. as if thou would torn all men by thy prechyng / Ne it is no mayst^^
for to make chirches or chapels: for to feed poor men and make hospitals. but
it is a maistry a man to love his eue^cristen in charity and wisely hate ye
syn^e of him and love the man / For though it be so y^ al thise deeds before
said are good in he^self. nevertheless they are common to good men and to bad /
for each man might do hem if that he would and had whereof / And for thy for
to do that each man may do I hold it no maistry / But for to love his even
christian in charity and hate his syn^e. may no man it do but oonli good men
which have it of the yefte of god and not of her traueile. To* ^
as saint poul says / Caritas dei diffusa est in cordibus vestris per sp^m
sccm^ qui datus est vobis / Love and charity is shed and spread in your hertes
by ye holy ghost. which is yeue^ to you / And therefore it is more precious and
the more deynte for to come by / All other good deeds wythouten this make not a
man good ne worthy the bliss of heaven. but this alone: and oonly this makes a
man good and al his good deeds medeful / All other yeftes of god and works of
man are comin to good and to bad / to chosen and to reproved / but this yeft of
charity is only of godd and of chosen souls /

That for the same deeds diverse men shall have diverse medes Caplm lxvi.
A Good man for the love of god fasteth waketh. gooth on pilgrymage / and
forsakyth all the likings of ye world sothfastly in his heart wythouten
feynynge / he shall have his mede in the bliss of heaven / And an ypocrite for
vaynglori of himself does the same deeds / and receives his mede here / Also
a very precher of goddis word fulfilled of charity and of mekenes sent of god
and of holy church received if he preche and teache goddis word / he shall
have a special mede of god / that is the aureole for his prechyng / An
ypocryte or an heretyke that has no mekenes ne charytee. ne arne send of god
nor yet of holy church / if they preche they have her mede here / Also a good
man in wordly state for love of god makyth many chyrches / chapelles. abbeys.
hospytals / and does many other good deeds of mercy / he shall have his mede
in the bliss of heaven / not for the deed in it self / but for ye good will
and the charity yt he has of ye yeft of god for to do tho good deeds / An
other man for vanytee of himself and worship and pleysyng of the world. and
for his own name does the same good deeds and has his mede here / The cause
is in all these that the tone has charity and the the other none which is one
and which is other our lord knowith and none but he /

That all men's good deeds shall be aproued that has liknes of good. saaf
the opyn heretic and the cursyd man. Caplm lxvii.
ANd therefore we should love and worship al men in our hertes. and aproue
examyn and receive all her deeds yt have the lyknesse of goodness though y^
doers in goddis sight ben bad save of the opyn heretyke and of the opyn cursed
man / Of thise two specially we shall flee and eschew the presence and the
co^minyng with hem / And we shall reprove and refuse her deeds seem they never
so good as long as they arne rebel to god and holy church / As if a worldly
cursed man make a church or feed poor men thou may sykerly hold it naught
and deem it as it is / Also if an opyn heretyke which is rebel to holy
church preche and teache / though he convert a hundred thousand souls /
hold the deed as to himself right naught / For these men are opynly out of
charity / without which is all naught that a man does /

That no good deed may make men saaf without charity / And that charity feel
they only yt be^ meke / ca lxviii
ANd therefore it is a great maistry a man to cun love his even christian in
charity / All this saying may be openly proved by saint poulis words thus / Si
linguis hominum loquar and angelorum / caritatem non habuero. nichil sum / Et
si habuero omne^ fidem ita vt montes transfera^. p^. cor^ i3
caritatem aute^ no^ habeam. nichil sum. Et si nouerim misteria oi^a. et si
destribuero om^es facultates meas in cibos pauperu^ / et tradidero corpus meum
igni vt ardeam / caritatem autem non habuero nichil michi prodest / Saint poul
in praysynge of charytee says thus / If I speak the langage of all men and of
angels also / if I have no charity I am right naught And if I have so great
faith that I may turn hills and bear hem away / and I have no charity I
am right naught And also though I had all manner of knowing of all pryu^tees /
without charity I am right naught / And if I give al yt I have to poor men and
my body to the fire to be brent. and I have no charity it profyteth me ryt nout
/ Here it semith by saint poules words that a man may do all good deeds
bodily wythouten charity / And that charity is naught else but for to love
god and his even cryste^ as himself. How should then any wretched caytit
living in earth what that he be have delight or trust or sykernes in himself for
ought that he can or may do with all his bodily myghtes or his kyndely reason
/ sith all this is naught worth wythouten love and charity to his even christian
/ And this charity may not be gotten with werkyng of himself / for it is a free
yefte of god sent in to a meke soul / as saint poul says. who then dare
hardely say that I have charity or I am in charity / Sothly no man may say
it sykerly / but he that is perfytly and sothfastly meke / Other men may trow
of hemself / and hope that they ben in charity by tokens / But he that is
perfytly meke felyth it / and therefore might he sykerly say it / Thus meke
was saint poul / and for thy said he thus of himself / Quis seperabit nos a
caritate dei? Tribulaco^ an angustia. etc / who shall depart me fro the
charity of god? Tribulaco^n or anguysshe. etc / And he answers himself and
says / There shall no creature put me fro the charity of god which I have in
christ Ihesu / Many men done deeds of charity and have no charity as I have
sayd^ For to repreue a syn^er for his syn^e to his ame^ding and in couenable
time it is a deed of charity. but to hate the syn^er instead of ye syn^e: it
is against charity / He that is verily meke can depart that one fro that other.
and no man but he / For though a man had all moral virtues of all
philosophers he cowde not do this / He should cu^ne hate the syn^e in all
other men for he hates it in himself / But he cowde not love the man in
charytee for all his phylosophye / Also if a man had knowing of all clergy
and of diuynite. and be not sothfastly meke he shall lightly err and stomble
and take the one for that other / But mekenes is worthy to receive a yefte of
god the which may not be learned by cunning of man / And therefore he that is
meke can hate the sin and truly love the man / But now perauenture thou
begynnest to dread for that I have said that charytee may not be gotten by no
work that thou may do / How shall thou then dooo / As unto this I say
that there is no thing so hard to get as charity / this is soth as within
our traueyle / And on the contrary wise I say that there is no yefte of god
that may so lightly be had as charity / For our lord yeuyth no yefte so
freely ne so gladly ne so comynly as he does charytee / How shall thou
then^e have it say thou. Be meke and low in spirit and thou shall have it /
And what is lyghter for to do tha^ for to be meke? Sothly no thing / Then
semyth it yt there is no thing that so lightly may be had as charity / and
therefore the needs not to be much adradde / Be meke and have it / Thus says
James thapostle. Deus superbis resistit^ hu^ilibus aute^ dat gracia^ / Our
lord he says ayenstondeth proud men / but to meke men he yeueth grace /
which grace is propirly his charity / for after the mesure of thy mekenes so
shall thou have charity / If thou have mekenes inperfitly oonly in will: not in
affecco^n. then shall thou have inperfyte charity This is good / for it
suffyseth to salvation as dauyd says Inperfectu^ meum videru^t oculi tui /
Lord with thyn eyes of mercy thou see mine inperfeccyon / But if thou have
mekenes perfytly. P.
then^e shall thou have perfyte charity. and that is best / The the other behouyth
us nedely to have it if we will be saaf. and this should we desire / Then if
thou ask me who is perfytely meke / thou shall no more have of me of mekenes
at this time but this / He is meke that sothfastly knowith himself as he is /

How a man shall wit how much wrath and envy is hyd in the ground of his
heart / Caplm lxix.
NOw turn yet again to this image if thou wolt assay how much ire and envy
is hid in thyn heart that thou felyst not / Look well and behold thyself
wisely when such stirynges of ire and envy against thyn even christian spryngen
out of thyn heart / The more styred that thou art by malencoly bitter or
wicked will against him. the more is this image in the / For the more thou
grutchest by inpacyence either aye^ste god for any trybulaco^n or syknes or
other bodily disese sent of god / or against thyn even christian for ought that
he does against the / the less is the image of Ihesu reformed in the. I say
not that such grutchynges or flesshly angrynes am dedely sins / but I say
that they letten the clennes of heart and pees of conscience that thou may not
have full charity by ye which thou sholdest come to life contemplatyf / For
that end is the purpoos of all my saying. that thou sholdest not oonly cleanse
thyn heart fro dedely sins: but also fro venyall as much as thou myghtest.
And that the ground of sin might by grace of Ihesu christ somewhat be slecket
in the /

By what tokens thou shall know if thou love thyn enmye / And what ensample
thou shall take of christ for to love him / Caplm lxx
FOr though it be so that thou felyst none evil against thyn even cryste^ for
a time / yet art thou not syker that the ground of ire is quenched in the /
ne yet art thou not lord of the virtue of charity / For suffer him towche the
a lityll by angry or a shrewde word / and thou shall feel anon if thine heart
be yet made hole by fulness of charity / The more thou art styred and evil
willed against the persone^ the ferder art thou fro charity / And if thou
naught be styred against the person. neither by angry chere outwarde^ ne by no
preuy hate in thy heart for to dispyse and deem him or for to set him at
naught. but the more shame or vylanye he does to the in word or in deed the
more pity and compassion thou have of him. as thou would have of a man that
were out of his mind / And the thinkyth you can not find in thyn heart for
to hate him. for love is so good in himself / but pray for him and help him.
and desiryng his amendyng / not oonly with thy mouth as ypocrytes can do. but
with affecco^n of love in thyn heart / then^e haast you perfect charity to thyn
even christian / This charity had saint stephen perfitly when he prayed for hem
that stoned him to deed / This charity cou^seyled christ to those that would be
his perfect folowers when he said thus / Diligite inimicos vro^s vn^facite hiis
qui oderu^t vos / etc^ M. v^
Loves your enmyes and do good to hem that haten you / prays for hem that
pursuen you And therefore if thou wol follow christ be like to him in this craft
/ Lere for to love thyn enmyes and sinful men / for all thise arn thy even
cryste^ / Look and bethynke the how christ loved Judas which was both his
dedely enmye and a sinful caytyf How goodly christ was to him. how benygne. how
curteyes / and how lowly to him that he knew dampnable / and nevertheless he
chase him to his apostle: and sent him for to preche with other apostles / He
yaaf him power for to werche miracles* he showed the same to him good chere in
word and in deed as he did to other apostles / He wysshe his fete and fed
him with his precious body / and prechid to him as he did to other appostles /
he wryed him not openly for it was preuy / ne myssaied him not. ne dispysed him
not. ne spoke never evil of him / and yet though he had done all thise. he had
said but soth / And ouermore when Judas took him. he kyssed him and called him
his friend / All this charity showed christ unto Judas the which he knew for
dampnable. in no manner feynyng ne flateryng but in the sothfastnes of good
love and clean charity / For though it were soth that Judas was not worthy for
to have had any yefte of god or any sign of love for his wyckidnes nevertheless
it was worthy and skylfull that our lord should sheew as he is / He is love and
goodness to all his creatures as he did to Judas / I say not that he loved him
for his sin. ne he loved him not for his chosen as he loved saint peter / but
he loved him in asmoche as he was his creature. and showed him tokens of love
if he would have be amended thereby / Follow after so^what if thou may / for
though thou art stoken in an house with thy body^ nevertheless in thyn heart
where the stead of love is thou should mow have part of such love to thyn
even christian as I speak of / Who so weneth himself to be a perfyte lover and
follower of crystis techyng in his living. as some man weneth yt he is in
asmoche as he precheth and techeth. and is poor of worldly good as christ was /
and can not follow criste in this love and charity for to love his even christian
each man good and bad friends and fooes wythouten feynynge flaterynge and
dispisyng in heart against the man. angrynes malicyous repreuyng: sothly he
begyleth himself / The nerer that he weneth he be. the ferder he is / For
christ said to hem that would be his discyples thus / Hoc est preceptu^ meu^ vt
diligatis inuicem sicut dilexi vos / This is my biddyng that ye should love
together as I have loved you. For if ye love as I have loved then^e are ye my
discyples / But now sayste thou. how shalt thou love him that is badde as well
as him that is good / As unto this I say thus. that thou shall love both good
and badde in charity but not for the same cause as I shall tell how / Thou
shalt love thyn even christian as thyself / Now you shall love thyself only in
god or else for god / In god thou love thyself when you art ryghtfull by
grace and virtuous / and love not thyself but oonly for that ryghtwysnesse
and virtues that god yeuyth ye then love thou thyself in god for thou
love not thyselfe but god / Also for god thou love thyself / as if thou
were in dedeli sin and would be made ryghtfull and wertuous. then^e love
thou thyself not as thou art / for thou art vnryghtful but as thou would be
/ Right so shall thou love thyn even christian / If they ben good and rightful
/ thou shall love hem by charity in god oonly for they ben good and ryghtful /
for then love thou god in hem as goodness and ryghtwysnes. more than if they
ben badde in dedely syn^e / as thyn enmyes that haten the or other of the
which thou have full euyde^ce that they are not in grace / yet shall thou love
hem / not as they arne. ne as good men and ryghtfull men / for they arn badde
and unrightful / but thou shall love hem for god that they might be good and
ryghtful / And so shall thou no thing hate in hem but that thing that is
contrary to ryghtwysnesse / and that is sin / This is as I vndstonde the
techyng of saint Austyn for to depart the love of the man fro the hate of the
sin and the love of thyn even christian / He that is meke or would sothfastly
be me can love thus his even crysten^ and none but he /

How a man shall know how much couetyse is hid in his heart / Caplm lxxi^
Lift well up this image and look well abowte. and thou shall mow see
couetyse and love of erthly things occupye a great party of this image.
though it seem lityl Thou have forsaken richesse and much hauour of this
world / and art spered in a dongeon / but have thou forsaken clenly the love
of all this / I hope not yet / It is less maystry for to forsake worldly good
than to forsake the love of it / Peraue^ture thou have not forsaken thy
couetyse / but thou have changed it fro great things in to small / as fro a
pownde unto a penny / and fro a silver piece unto a disshe of an halfpeny This is
a simple change / thou art no good merchant / These ensamples arn
chyldisshe / nevertheless they betoken more / If thou trow not me assaye
thyself / If thou have love and delight in the having and holdyng of any thing
that thou have such as it is / with ye which love thou fedest thyn heart for
a time Or if thou have desire and yernyng for to have some thing that you haste
not / with which desire thyn heart is traueyled and stourbled by unskillful
belynesse that the clean desire of virtue and of god may not rest therein / this
is a token that there is couetise in this image / And if thou wolte assaye
better / look if any thing that thou have be taken away fro the by maystry or
by borowyng. or by any other wise. and thou may not get it again / and for thy
thou art disesed angered and trowbled in thyn heart both for thou want that
thing that thou would have / and may not have it / and also ayenste him that
has it you art styred for to strive and chyde with him for he might restore
the again and will not / this is a token that thou love worldly goods / For
thus done worldly men / when her good and her richesse is taken fro hem they
arn heavy sorry angry and chiding and striuyng against hem that have it openly by
word and by deed / but thou do all this in thyn heart pryuely where god
sees and yet thou art in more defawte than a worldly man. For you have forsaken
in lyckenes the love of worldly things / but a worldly man has not so / and
therefore he is exscused though he strive and pursue for his goods by lawful
ways for to have hem again / But now say thou that the behooves for to have
thy necessaryes of such things as longen to the as well as a worldly man / I
grant well thereto / but thou should not love it for it self / ne likyng have
in the holdyng ne in ye keeping / ne sorrow ne heaviness feel in the lesyng or
in ye withdrawyng of it / For as saint gregory says / Asmoche sorrow as thou
have in lesyng of a thing. Greg*
so much love had thou in the keeping / And therefore if thyn heart were
made hoole / and thou had sothfastly felt desire of ghostly things: and
had there with all a syghte of the leest ghostly thing that is. all ye love
and the likyng of any erthly thing thou sholdest set it at naught / it
should not cleue upon the / For to love and for to have more than the needs
skylfully oonly for lust and likynge it is a great defawte / Also for to
fetchen thy love upon ye thing that the needs for it self / it is defawte
but not so great But for to have and vsen that thing that the needs wythoute^
love of it more than kind or need asks wythoute^ which the thing may not
be used / it is no defawte / ^othli in this point as I trow many that have
the state and the lyknesse of pouertee arn much let and hyndered fro the
love of god / I ne accuse no man ne no state reprove / for in each astate
some arn good and some arn other / But one thing I say to every man or woman
that has taken the state of wylfull pouerte whether he be religyous or seculer
or what degree he be in / as long as his love and his affection is bounden and
fastened as. and it were glewed with ye love of any erthly thing that he has
or would have / he may not have ne feel sothfastly the clean love and the clear
syghte of ghostly things / Augus.
For saint Austyn said to our lord thus / Lord he loves the but lytill / ye
louyth any thing with the / that he loves not for the / For ye more love and
couetyse of any erthly thing is with the / the less is the love of god in
thyn heart / For though it be so that this love of erthly thing puts hem not
out of charity but if it be so much that it strangle the love of god and of
her even christian / sothely it hyndreth hem and lets hem fro the fervor of
charity / and also fro that special mede which they should have in the bliss
of heaven for perfect pouerte / and that is a great loss if they might see it
/ For who so might know ghostly mede how good how precious and how worthy it
is / for it is aye lasting / he would not for the love of all erthly Joy or
hauour of all erthly thing if he might have it wythoute^ syn^e let ne less
the lest mede of the bliss of heaven which he might have if that he would / I
speak ferther than I do. But I pray the do thus as I say by ye grace of god
if thou may or any other man who so will / For that were a comfort to my
heart that if I may not have it in myself as I say. that I might have it in
the / Or in any other creature which has received more plente of his grace
than I / But see now then sith couetyse in the naked ground lets a man or
a woman so much fro the ghostly felyng of the love of god / how much more
then^e it lets and combreth worldly men and wym^en the which by all her
wits and bodily besynes night and day study and traueyle how they might
get riches and plente of worldly good / They can none other delight have but in
worldly things / ne they will not for they seche it not / I say no more of hem
at this time: for in this writing I speak not to hem / But this I say / if
they might see and would see what they do / they should not do so /

How a man shall know when he synneth not in etynge and drynkyng / and when he
synneth venyally / and when dedely / Caplm lxxii.
YEt may thou see more in this image though it be derke. and that is flesshli
love to thiself. in glotenye accidie and lecherye / Thise flesshly likings
maken a man full bestly and far fro the inly savor of the love of god. and
fro ye clear syghte of ghostly things / But now say thou. Sith the behooves
nedelynges ete and drink and sleep. and that may thou not do wythouten likyng
/ therefore the thynkyth this liking is no sin / As unto this I say. that
if thou keep in etynge or drinking and in other needful things of thy body
mesure in thy need / and thou receyuest no more likynge than kind askyth /
And all this thou do for ghostely delight which thou felyst in thy soul /
I grant ye forsothe that thou then synnest right naught therein / for then
can thou well ete and sleep / Sothly and wythouten doubt I am full far fro
that knowing and ferd fro the werchynge / For to ete I have by kind / but to
cu^ne ete I may not but by the grace of god. Saint poul had by grace this
cunnyng as he says himself thus / Vbique and in oi^bus institutus su^. scio
saciari and esurire / habu^ dare and penuria^ pati. Phil iiii
Oi^a possu^ in eo qui me co^fortat: I am informed and kenned in all things.
For I can hunger and I can ete. I can with plente and I can with pouerte / I
may all in him that strenghthith me / Saint austyn said till our lord thus
Lord thou have teched me that I should take mete as a medicine / Augus.
Hunger is a syknes of kind / and mete is a medicyne there to / Therefore the
likyng that comyth with all in asmoche as it is kyndly and nedfull it is no
syn^e / but when it passith into lust and into wylfull likyng then^e it is
sin / And therefore ther^ lies all the maystrye for to cu^ne depart wisely
need fro lust and wylfull likyng they are so knytte together / and that one
comyth with that other. so that it is hard for to receive that one as the need
and repreue that other as wylfull lust the which often comyth vnd color of
need / Nevertheless sith it is so yt need is the ground of this* and that
need is no sin / for be a man never so holy him behouyth to ete and drink
and sleep therefore the lust and the likynge that comyth vnd the color of this
need and passyth this need is the less syn^e / For a man synneth not dedely
comynly in glotenye. but if he be encombred with other dedely sins beforn
done / then^e may he the light liar sin dedely in this / For it is soth he
that chesyth lust and liking of his flesh and delytes in welfare of mete or
drink as full rest of his heart that he would never have other lyffe ne other
bliss but live ever in such lust of his flesh if he might. it is no dowte
but y^ he syn^eth dedely / for he loves his flesh more than god / But he
that lies in dedely sin of pride or envy or such other he is so blinded
by the devil y^ for the time he has no power of his free will / and therefore
he may not well ayensto^de flesshly likings when they come but falls down
wylfully to hem as a best does to karyon / And in asmoche as he has no
general will before to god principally by cause that he is in dedely syn^e.
therefore ye lust of glotenye the which he falls in lightly is to him dedely
sin / for he makith none aye^stondyng general ne special. But a another man
or woman which in grace or charity has always a good general will to god in
his soul wheder he sleep or wake ete or drink or what good deed yt he does.
so that it be not evil in itself by the which will and desire he chesyth
god above all thing. and has lever forbere all thing of the world than wrath
his god for love of him / This will though it be but general it is of so
great virtue by the grace of our lord Ihu^ that if he fall by freelte in lust
and in likyng of mete and of drink or of such other siknes. either by excess
of tomoche etyng or to often or to gredely or to lustly. and delicatly. or
tosone in vntyme. it saves him and kepith him fro dedely syn^e / And this is
soth aslonge as he is in charity by other deeds. and kepyth his general will
to all that he does. and namly if he know among his own wretchidnes and
cry after mercy. and be in purpose specially to aye^stonde such fleshly
lusts for our lord is good and merciful. and thise venyall sins of glotenye
he foryeuyth right sone unto a meke soul / For the stiryng and the likyng of
glotenye in asmoche as they are hardest for to flee by cause of need of ye
bodily kind among all other sins are most exscuable and leest perilous /
And therefore thou shall not rise against the ground of this syn^e as you shall
against all other sins / for ye ground of this sin is oonly need which
may not be escaped but if thou wylt do worse as slay ye need as many foles
done / which sholden slay the theyf and spare the true man / That is to say /
They sholden slay unskillful lust and the wilful likyng. and spare and keep
the bodily kind. and they do not so / But against all other sins thou shall
arise for to destroy not oonly dedely sins and the great venyals / but also
against the ground of hem as much as thou may / See by this skylle / Thou
may not live without mete and drink / but thou may live without lecherye if
thou will and never but the better / And therefore thou shall not flee only the
deed of it which is dedely sin. but also wylfull likyng of it in thine heart
withouten deed which is venyall syn^e / and sometime it is dely. but also thou
shall traueyle against the ground of it for to destroy the felyng and the
risyng of flesshly stiryng /

How the ground of lechery should be destroyed with ghostli traueyle and with
bodily / Caplm lxxiii.
But this traueyle against the ground of lechery shall be goostly / as by
prayers and ghostly virtues. and not by bodily penance. For wit thou well
that if thou fast and wake and scourge thyselfe / and do all that thou can /
thou shall never have ye clennes and the chastity without the yefte of god and
the garce of mekenes / Thou sholdest sooner slay thyselfe than thou sholdeste
slay flesshly stirynges and felynges of lust and lechery either in thyn heart
or in thy flesh by any bodily penance / But by the grace of Ihesu in a meke
soul the ground may be much stopped and destroyed. and the spring may be
much dried / And that is very chastity in body and in soul / On the same
manner may be said of pride and of couetise and of such other. for thou might
live if thou were not proud ne covetous / And therefore thou shall destroy all
the felynges of hem asmoche as you may / But in glotenye thou shall rise and
smite away the unskillful stirynges. and save the ground hole /

That a man should be besye to put away all stirynges of sin / but more
besye of ghostly sins than of bodily Caplm lxxiiii
ANd therefore he that ryseth against the felyng of flesshly likynge in mete and
drink more fully and more sha^ply than of pride or couetyse / which for they
semen fair aren not lyghtely reproved / Or of Envy. or of Lecherye / I say
that he is half blind / for he sees not yet ghostly uncleanness / As of pride
and envy how foul it is in goddis site / I hope if a man might see with his
eye ghostly how foul pride and couetyse arne in the syghte of god / and how
contrary to him / He should more loath a styryng of pride and the vain liking
of it / And also he should the more agryse and rise against that evil will of
envy or ire to his even christian than many a styryng or lykyng either of
glotenye or of lecherye / Nevertheless all men wenen not so / For comynly men
arn more eschew for to feel a styryng of flesshly sin / and have for it more
sorrow and heaviness than for the great likings in vain glory or in other
ghostly sins / But they arn not wise / For if they will understand holy
writ and doctors sawes thereof / they sholden find as I say / which I ne
may ne will rehearse now / I will not exscuse hem that fallen in likings of
glotenye and lecherye that they sin not / For I wot well that all the spyces
of hem arn sin more or less after the mesure of the lust of the sin and
other lykynges with wylfull cyrcumstaunces / But I would that thou knew and
charged all / ylke a sin as it is / more the more / as arn ghostli sins /
less the less arn as flesshly sins. And yet shall thou nevertheless hate and
flee all both bodily and ghostly upon thy might / For wit thou well that
flesshly desires and unskillful likings in mete and drink / Or any likings
that longen to the body passing reasonable need. though they ben not always
great sins to him that is in charity / nevertheless to a soul that desires
clennes and ghostly felyng of god they arn full heavy paynfull and bitter and
much for to eschew. For the spirit may not feel his kyndly savor with in.
till the flesh have lost his bestly savor wythouten /

That hunger and other bodily pains lets much goostly werchynge / Caplm
lxxv^
ANd therefore if thou wolt come to clennes of heart the behouyth ayenstonde
unskillful stiryng of flesshly desires / But against the ground thou shall not
rise. as I have said before / For the ground of it is need. as kyndely hunger
which thou shall nedelynges feel and tent thereto in time / and help thyself
against it by medicyne of mete. as thou would help thiself reasonable against a
bodily syknes / that thou might more freely serve god both bodily and ghostly
/ For wit thou well what man or woman that shall be occupied ghostly in
thoughts: unskillful pain or hunger wylfully taken or bodily syknes in the
stomach or in the head / or in other party of the body for the defawte of good
rulyng of himself. by tomoche fasting. or by any other wise / shall much let
the spirit / and much hinder him fro the knowing and beholdynge of ghostly
things / but if he have the more grace / For though it be so that bodily
pain / either of penance or of syknesse or else bodily occupacyon sometime
lets not the fervor of love to god in devotion / but often encreasyth it /
Nevertheless I hope that it lettith the fervor of love in contemplaco^n the
which may not be had ne felyd sadly but in rest of body and of soul /

What Remedy a man shall use against defawte made in etynge or drynkyng / Caplm
lxxvi.
FOr thy doo^ thou skylfully that longs to the / and keep thy bodily kind
upon reison / and suffer god then send what he will hele or syknesse / take
it gladly / and grutche not against god wylfully / Do thou as I say: take thy
mete as it commyth / And ordeyne for it if need be upon reason / And take it
gladly as for need / But be well waar of lust that commyth with need / ^schewe
to much as well as to lityll And so when thou haste done / and then it
commyth to thy mind the bytynge of conscience that thou haste eten tomoche /
And so then begynnest for to tarry the / and draw to over much byttyrnesse
/ Lift up the desire of thine heart to thy good lord Ihesu / and know thyself
for a wretch and a best / and ask him forgyuenesse. and say that thou will
amend it / and trust of forgyuenesse / Leave of then and tarry no longer
with all / ne strive not much as thou would destroy it utterly / for it is
not worth for to do so / Thou shalt never bring it so abowte / but redily
ordeyne the redi to some other occupacyon bodily or ghostly / after thou felyst
the disposyd that thou myghtest more profit in other virtues / as meekness
and charity. For wit thou well he that has in his desire and in his
traueylle none other reward to none other thing but to mekenes and charytee /
aye cryenge after hem how he might have hem / he shall in that desire /
werchynge folowand after profit and wexe in all other virtues / as in chastyte
abstynence and such other if he have but lityll reward in hem in a year more
than he should wythouten this desire profit in seven / if he strive with
glotenye lechery and such other contynuelly / and beat himself with scourges
each day fro morrow to euensong time /

That thorough by desire and traueyle for meekness and charytee a man comyth
sooner to other virtues than by traueyle in hemself / Caplm lxxvii.
Get to the then mekenes and charytee / And if thou wolte traueyle and
swynke besily for to have hem. you shall have enough for to do in getyng of hem
/ And if you may get hem / they shall rule the and mesure the full pryuely how
thou shall ete and how thou shall drink and socour all thy bodyly need that
there shall no man wit it but if thou wolte / and that shall not be in
perplexite ne in ire ne in anguyssh^nes and heuines ne in lusts ne in
likings. but in pees of glad conscience wc a sad restfulnes. I speak ferder
tha^ I thout to have spoken in this mater^. but netheles do if you may as I the
say. and I hope god shall make al well / by this yt I have said may you somdel
see in this image of sin how much it lets the / The gospel says how
Abraham spoke to the rich man that was beryed in hell on this wise / Chaos
magnum inter nos and vos firmatum est vt hii qui volu^t transire ad vos non
possu^t nec huc transmeare / There is a great chaos. that it to sayen a thycke
derknesse between us and the that we mow not come to the ne thou till us /
This derke image in thy soul and min also may be called a great chaos / that
is a great derknes. for it lets us that we mow not come to abraham which is
Ihesu / and it lettyth him that he woll not come to us*

Of the derknes of the image of sin. And what comyth in by the wyndowes
thereof / Caplm lxxviii.
Lift up thy lantern and see in this image five wyndowes by the which sin
comyth in to thy soul as ye prophet says / ^
Mors ingreditur per fenestras nostras / Death comyth in by our wyndowes / Thise
wyndowes arn the five wits by the which thy soul gooth out fro by himself /
and sechyth his delight and his fedynge in erthely things against his own kind
/ As by the eye for to see curyous and fair things / and so of other wits
/ By the vnskylful vsyng of thise wits in to vanyte wilfully / thy soul is
much let fro ghostly wits within / and therefore the behooves stoppe^
thise wyndowes or spear hem / but oonly when need asks for to open hem /

That the soul for defawte of knowing of it self gooth onte by five wyndowes
to seche outward likynge. Caplm lxxix.
ANd that were lityll maystry to the if thou myghtest ones see thy soul by
clear understanding what it is and how fair it is in his own kind / Ne it
were that it is so ouerlayed with a black mantell of this foul image. but
for you knowist it not. therefore you leuest the inly sight of thiself and
sechest thy mete forth withoute^ as a best unreasonable. thus says lord
manassyng to a chosen soul in holy writ. Si ignoraste o pulcra inter
mulieres. Cant^ 1.
egredere and abi post vestigia gregu^ sodalium tuorum et pasce edos tuos /
Thou fair among wymmen if thou know not thyselfe. goo out and walk after
the steps of the flock of thy fellows and feed thy get / and it is thus
much for to say / Thou soul fair by kind made to the lyknesse of god freel
as a woman in the body for ye first sin by cause that thou know not
thyselfe / that angels food should be thy delyces within / Therefore thou ghost
out by thy bodily wits and sechest thy mete and thy likynge as a best of
the flock / that is as one repreuyd / and therewyth thou fedest thy thoughts
and thyn affeccyons which arn unclean as gotes / It is a shame to the for to
do so /

That a soul should not beg without forth but with in of Ihesu that it needs

ANd therefore turn home again in thyself and hold the within / and beg no
more wythouten namely swynes mete / For if thou woll algates be a beggar ask
and crave within of thy lord Ihesu / for he is rich enough / and gladlyer
woll give the than thou wolt ask / And run no more out as a best of the
flock / that is a worldly man or woman that has no more delight but in his
bodily wits. And if thou do thus thy lord Ihesu woll give the all that the
needs / For he may led the in to his wine seler / and make the for to assaye
of his wynes which the lyketh best for he has many tonnes / Thus a chosen
soul Ioyenge in holy writ says of our lord / Introduxit me rex in cellam
vinariam / Cant* ^.
A king ladde me in to a wine celer / And that is for to say^ / ^ In as much
as I forsake the dronkennes of flesshely lusts and worldely lykynges / which
arne bitter as wormode / f^r thy the king of bliss lord Ihesu led me in /
That is to say / First in to my self for to behold and know myself / And
after he led me in to his celer / that is to say. abouen myself by
ouerpassyng oonly in till him. and gaaf me assaye of his wine / yt is for to
taast a syknes of ghostly swetnes and heavenly Joy / Thise arne not words of
me a wretchyd caytif living in sin / but they arn words of the spowse of our
lord in holy wrytt / and thise words I say to the that you might draw in thy
soul fro wythouten / and follow after as thou may /

That the hole of ymaginaco^n nedyth to be stopped as well as the wyndowes of
the wits / Caplm lxxxi
But now say thou that thou do so / thou see no worldly things ne
herest none. ne have none use of thy bodily wits more than need asks / and
for thy thou art enclosed / As to this I say. If thou do thus as I hope thou
do then have thou stopped a great wyndow of this image. but yet art thou
not syker. for thou have not stopped the prive holes of the ymaginyng in thine
heart / For if thou see me not with thy bodily eye thou may see me in thy
soul by ymagynaco^n / and so may thou do of al bodily things / Then^e if
thy soul be fed wilfully by ymaginacio^s of vanytees of the world. and
desiryng of worldly things for a wylfull comfort and ease / sothly if thy
soul be within as for the bodyly wits. it is nevertheless full far
wythouten by such vain ymaginaco^n / But now ask thou whether it be any
great sin a soul for to occupye him in such vanytees either in wits or in
ymaginyng / As unto this I say that I would yt thou sholdest never ask man
this questyon / For he that wylt sothfastly love god he askith not cominly
whether this is greter syn^e or this / For him shall think what thing lettith
him fro the love of god is great sin / and him shall think no thing sin
but that thing which is not good. and lets him fro the love of god / What
is sin but a wanting or a forberyng of good / I say not that it shall be
paynful to him as a dedely sin or a venyall should ben. ne I say not but
that he knows dedely fro venyall and more flees it /

When the use of the wits ben dedely syn^e. and when venyall / Caplm lxxxii.
Nevertheless some dele shall I say to thy questyon. For thy desire drawyth
more out of mine heart than I thought for to have said in the beginning / Our
lord says in the gospel thus / Homo quida^ fecit cenam magna^ etvocauit
multos and misit seruu^ suu^ dicere inuitatis vt venire^t / Primus dixit.
Villa^ emi. Luc. xiiii
rogo te habe me excusatu^ / Scds dixit / Iuga bou^ emi quinque et eo probare

great supper and called many thereto. And sent his servant at supper time after
hem that were prayed / The first exscused him and said on thy^ wise that he
might not come for he had boughte a town / The the other also excused him that
he might not come for he had boughte five yockes of oxen and yede for to assaye
hem / The third for he had weddded a wife / I leave for to speak of the first
and of the last / and I tell the of the myddelest of him that boughte the
oxen / for he is to this purpoos / Five yockes of oxen betoke^ the five wits
which arn beestly as an ox. Now this man that was called to the supper was
not repreued for he boughte these oxen / but for he yede for to assaye he^ and
so he would not come / Right so say I to the / For to have thy wits and
use hem in need. it is no sin / But if thou goo wylfully for to assaye hem
by vain delight in creatures then it is sin / For if thou chese that delight
as for a fynall rest of thy soul. and as a full likyng / that thou kepeste
none other bliss to have but such maner^ worldly vanyte then it is dedely /
for thou chesest it as thy god / and so shall thou be put fro ye supper / For
saint poul forbede us that we should not assaye our wytt so when he said thus /
Post co^cupisce^cias tuas no^ eas. Thou shall not goo after thy lust. ne will
fully assaye thy likings / A man or a woman that is encombred with dedely
syn^e shall not well escape dedely syn^e in this though he see it not / but I
hope it touches not the / Nevertheless if thou by freelte delight the in thy
wits and such vanytee / but in that thou kepest the in charity in other
sides / and thou chesest not this delight for a full rest of thy soul but thou
set test aye god before all thing in thy desire. this sin is venial after the
circu^staunce more or less / ne thou shall not for thise venyall sins be put
fro the supper in the bliss of heaven / but thou shall want the taastyng and
the assayeng of that delycate supper living in earth / but if thou be besye
with all thy mytes for to ayenstonde such venyall sins / For though it be so
that venyall sins break not charity / sothly they let the fervor and the
ghostly felyng of charity /

But now say thou that thou may not keep the fro heryng of vanytees. for
diverse men worldly and other come often for to speak with the. and tell the
some tales of vanyte As unto this I say thus / that comynyng with thyn even
christian is not much against the but helpith the sometime if thou werche wisely /
For thou may assaye thereby ye mesure of thy charity to thyn even christian
whether it be much or lityll / Thou art bounden as each man and woman is to
love thin eue^ christian pryncypally in thine heart and also in deed / for to
show hem tokens of charity as reason asks after thy might and after thy
knowing / Now sythen it is so that thou owe not to goo out of thyn house
for to seek occasion how thou mite profit thyn even christian by deeds of mercy
/ by cause thou art encloos^ Nevertheless thou art bounden for to love hem
all in thyn heart / and to hem that come to the to show hem tokens of love
sothfastly / And therefore who so will speak with the what that he be. or in
what degree that he be and you know not what he is ne why he comyth / be soon
ready wc a good will for to wit what his will is / Be not dangerous ne suffer
him not long abide the / but look how ready and how glad thou would be if
an angel of heaven would come so and speak with the. so ready and so buxome be
thou in will for to speak with thyn even christian when he comyth to the for thou
woost not what he is ne whi he comes ne what need he has of the. or thou of
him till thou have assayed / And though thou be in prayer or in deuoco^n that
the thinks looth for to break of. for the thinks you sholdest not leave god
for no ma^nys speech / me thinks not so in this caas. For if thou be wise
thou shall not leave god. but thou shall find him and have him and see him in
thyn even christian as well as in prayer / But on a other manner thou shall have
him than in prayer / If thou can well love thyn even christian it should not
hinder the for to speak with hem dyscretly / Dyscrecyon shall thou have on this
manner as me thinks / Who so comyth to the ask him mekely what he will / And
if he come for to tell his dysese and for to be comforted of thy speech here
him gladly / and suffer him say what he will for ease of his own heart / And
when he has done comfort him if you can gladly. goodly and charitably. and
soon break of / And then^e after that if he will fall in to idle tales or
vanytees of the world or of other men's deeds / answer him but litylll ne
feed not his speech / and he shall soon be weary. and sone take his leave / If
it be an other man that comith for to teache the as a man of holy church here
him lowely with reverence for his order / And if his speech comfort the ask
of him. and make the not for to teache him / It falls not to the for to teache
a priest but in need / If his speech comfort the not answer little. and he
will soon take his leave / If it be a another man yt comes to give the his
alms. or else for to here ye speak. or for to be taute of ye. speak godely
and mekeli to hem all. repreue no man of his defawtes / it falls not to the
but if he be ye more homely with the that thou woost well that he will take it
of the / And shortly to say as thou conceyuest that should profit thyn even
christian namly ghostly may thou say if you can and he will take it / And of all
other things keep scilence asmoche as thou may / and thou shall in short
time have but lityll prees that shall let the / Thus me thinks / do better
if thou can /

Of the derke image of sin / and of the clothyng ther^of / Caplm lxxxiiii.
BY this that I have said may thou see a lityll the derknes of this image of
syn^e / not for I have discryued it fully to the as it is for I can not /
Nevertheless by this lityll thou may see more if thou look well / But now say
thou whereby wost thou that I bear such an image about with me as thou spekest
of / As on this I can answer / I may take upon me a word said by the
prophet / (...). 12*
and it is this / Inueni idolu^ michi / That is to say / I have found a falls
image that men callen a mawmente in myself well foul disfygured and forshapen
with wretchydnes of all these sins which I have spoken of / by the which I
am casten down in many flesshly lykynges and worldly vanytees fro clen^es of
heart and felyng of goostly virtues more than I can or may say. and that me
repe^teth and I cry god mercy / By this wretchidnesse that I feel in myself
more than I have said may I the better tell the of thyn image / For all come
we of adam and of eve clothed with clothes of a bestes hyde / as holy writ
says of our lord thus. Fecit deus ade and vrori eius tunicas pelliceas /
Gen^. 3.
Our lord made to adam and to his wife clothes of a bestes hyde / In token
that for his syn^e he was forshape^ like to a best / with which bestly
clothes we al ben borne and vmbilapped and disfigured fro our kyndly shappe /

Which be^ the lym^es of the image of syn^e / Caplm lxxxv.
Then is this an ugly image for to look upon / The head is pride / For pride
is the first and the pryncipall sin as the wise man says / Iniciu^ oi^s
pcti^ superbia / Ecc^^.
The beginning of all manner of sin is pride / The back and the hinder party
of it is couetyse. Phil 3.
as saint poul says / Que retro su^t obliuiscens in anteriora me extendo / I
shall foryete all worldly things which arn backewarde / and I shall stretche
me forward to endless things / The breast in the which is the heart is envy /
for it is no flesshly syn^e but it is a deuels sin as the wise man says /
Inuidia diaboli mors intrauit in orbe^ter rarum. Sap^. 2.
Imitant illu^ oe^s qui ex part eius sunt / By envy of the devil death
comyth in to all the world / For thy all thoo that are of his party follow him
therein. The arms of it are wrath in asmoche as a man wreketh him of his
wrath by his arms against crystis biddyng in the gospel. ^
Si quis te percus serit super vna^ maxilla^ prebe sibi altera^ / If a man
smite the upon the tone cheke with his hand. thou shall not smite him again but
offer him that other cheke^ The belly of this image is glotenye as saint poul
says / Esca ventri et venture escis. ^
deus hu^c and has destruet / Mete serves to the belly. and the belly serves to
get mete / but god shall destroy both belly and mete / That shall be at the
last end in the full reformyng of his chosen and in demyng of reproved / The
members of it are lechery of the which saint poul says thus / No^ exhibeatis
membra ^estra arma iniquitatis ad peccatu^ / ye shall not give your me^bres
specially your pryue members for to be arms of syn^e / The fete of this image
are accidye / Therefore the wise man says to the slow for to styre him to good
works / Discurre festina suscita amicu^ tuum / That is to say / Run quyckly
about unto good works and haast the soon / for the time passyth / prou. ^.
and reyse up thy friend which is Ihesu by devout prayer and meditaco^n /
Here have thou herd the members of this image /

Whereof the image of Ihesu is made. and whereof the image of sin / and how we
ben passing forth in the image of sin / Caplm lxxxvi.
THis is not the image of Ihesu but it is liker an image of the devil / For
the image of Ihesu is made of virtues with mekenes and perfyte love and charity
/ but this is of false flesshly love to thyself with al these members festuyd
thereto This image berest thou and every man what that he be until by grace of
Ihesu it be somdele destroyed and broken down / Thus it semyth that dauyd
says in the sawter book / Veru^p tamen in ymagine pertransit homo. P^ 3viii
sed et frustra conturbat This is for to say / Though it be so that a man
were made in the begyn^yng to the image of god stable and steadfast /
nevertheless by cause of syn^e he forthpassith living in this world in this
image of synne^ by the which he is unstable and trowbled in vain / Also saint
poul spekyth of this image thus Sicut portauimus ymagine^ terreni hominis sic
portemus ymagine^ celestis / That is to say / If we wol come to the love of
god / as we have here before borne ye image of the erthly man. first adam that
is the image of syn^e. Right so now let us bear the image of the heavenly man
Ihesu which is the image of virtues /

How we should crucifye this image of sin. and quycken the image of Ihesu /
Caplm lxxxvii.
WHat shall thou then^e do with this image / I answer the by a word you the
Jews said to pylat of christ. John. 1^.
Crucifige eu^ / Take thou this body of sin and do him on ye cross / That
is for to say / Break down this image and slay the false love of sin in
thyself / as cristis body was slain for our sin and our trespaas / Right so
the behouyth if thou wolte be like to christ slay thy bodily likynge and
flesshely lusts in thyselfe / Gal. ^.
Thus said saint poul / Qui autem cristi sunt came^ suam crucifixerunt cum
viciis and concupiscenciis / Thise that arn cristis folowers has crucified and
slain her flesh that is the image of sin with all the lusts and the
unskillful lykynges of it / Slay then and break down pride. and set up
meekness / Also break down ire and envy and reyse up love and charity to
thyn even christian. Also instead of couetyse. pouertee in spirit / Instead of
accidye. fervor in devotion with glad redynes to all good deeds / And in the
stead of glotenye and lecherye. sobirte and chastyte in body and in soul /
This co^sydered saint poul when he said thus / Deponentes veterem homine^ cu^
suis actibus qui corru^pitur scdm desideria erroris. Ep^. iiii
et induite nouu^ homine^ qui scdm deum creatus est in sanctitate and iusticia
/ ye shall put down the old man that is the image of sin of the old adam
with all his members / for he is rotin in desires of error / and ye shall shape
you and clothe you in a new man which is the image of god by holiness and
ryghtwysnes and full head of virtues / who shall help the. break down this
image / Sothly thy lord Ihesu / In the virtue and in the name of him shall
thou break down this mawmente of sin / Pray him besily and desire. and he
shall help the /

What profit comyth of keeping of the heart / And how much the soul is. and
what it louyth / Caplm lxxxviii:
GAder then thyn heart together and do after the cou^seyl of the wise man
when he says thus / Om^i custodia serua cor tuu^. qm^ ex ip^o vita procedit /
with all thy besynes keep thyn herte^ for out of it comyth life / And that is
soth when it is well kept / For then wise thoughts clean affeccyons and
brennyng desires of virtues and of charity and of the bliss of heaven comen
out of it. and makith the soul to live a blessed life / Also on the contrary
wise if it be not kept / then as our lord says in the gospel / De cord
exiu^t cogitaciones male que coinquinant hominem / Evil thoughts and unclean
affeccyons comen out of the heart the which defoulen man as our lord says
/ They either benymme the life of the soul by dedely sin. Or else they
feeble the soul and maken it syke if they ben venyall / For what is a man but
his thoughts and his loves / These maken a man oonly good or badde / As much
as thou love god and thyn even christian and knowyst him. so much is thy
soul / And if thou lityll love him. lityll is thy soul / and if thou nouhgt
love him. nougte is thy soul / It is naught as for good / but it is much as
for syn^e / And if thou wylt wit what thou love look where upon thou
thynkest / For where the love is there is the eye and where the likynge is
there is most the heart thinking / If thou love much god / the likyth for to
think much upon him / And if thou love lityll / then lityll thou thynkest
upon him / Rule well thy thoughts and thyn affecco^ns and then art thou
virtuous /

How the image of sin shall be broken down / Caplm lxxxix.
Begin then on and break this image when thou have Inwardely bethoughte the
of thyselfe and of thy wretchydnesse as I have said / how proud. how vain.
and how enuyous / how malencolyous / how covetous / how flesshly / and how full
of corrupcyon / Also how lityll knowing felyng or savor thou haast of god /
and of ghostly things / How wise. how quick / and how much savor thou have
in erthly things / And shortly that the thinks the also full of sin as the
hyde is full of flesh / Be thou not to much adradde though thou think so
of thyselfe / And when thou have done thus lift up then the desire of thy
heart to thy lord Ihesu / and pray him of help / Erye to him by great
desires and syghinges that he will help the to bear this great bourden of this
image. or else that he will break it / Think also such a shame it is for the
to be fed with swynes mete of flesshly savors that sholdest feel a ghostly
savor of heavenly Joy / If thou do thus / then begynnest thou for to arise
ayenste the hole ground of sin in the as I have said / And it may so be
that thou shall feel pain and sorrow / for thou shall understand that there
may no soul live without great pain but if he have rest and delight either
in his creator or in a creature / Then when thou rysest against thyself by a
feruente desire for to feel of thy lord Ihesu / and for to draew out thy love
fro al bodyly things / and fro rest in thy bodily feeling. in so much that
thou art encombred of thiselfe / And the thinks that all creatures ryse^
against the / and all things which thou had delight in before tourneth the
to pain / And when thou forsakest thus thyself / and thou may not lightly
find comfort in god / nedelynges thy soul shall suffer pain / Nevertheless
I hope who so would suffer this pain awhyle steadfastly cleuynge upon that
desire and naked mind of Ihesu christ / and upon desire that he would not have
but his lord and fall not lightly therfro / ne seche no comfort outward
for a time / for it lastyth not long / Our lord is nyghe and soon shall ease
the heart / For he will help to bear thy body full of corrupcyon / And he woll
with his mercyful might of gracyous presence break down this false image of
love in thyselfe / Not all atones / but lityll and little till thou be somdele
reformed to his lyckenesse /

How a man shall have him to the stiryng of pride and of all other vices /
Caplm lxxxx.
AFter such an hole rysyng against thyself when it is passyd. thou shall more
sobirly and more easily rule thyselfe / And the more sadly for to keep thy
thoughts and thyn affeccyons for to know hem whether they ben good or bad And
then^e if that thou feel a stiryng of pride in any manner of spyce of it / Be
soon well waar if that thou may / and suffer not it escape lightly away / But
take it in mind and rent it break it and dispyse it / and do all ye shame
that thou may thereto / Look thou spare it not. ne trow it not speak he never
so fair / for it is false though it seem soth as the prophet says / Popule
meus qui te beatu^ dicunt ipsi te desipiu^t et in errorem mittunt / That is to
say thus / Thou man of my people they that sayen thou art blessed and holy.
Isay^ 3.
they begyle and bryngen the in to error / And if thou do thus often besily
thou shall by the grace of Ihu^ within short time stop much of the spring
of pride. and much abate the vayn delight thereof that thou shall uneaths feel
it / And when thou felyst it it shall be so weyke and as it were half deed
that it shall not much grieve the. And then shall thou mow have a ghostly
syghte of meekness how good and how fair it is and thou shall desire it and
love it for the goodness of itself / that the shall lyken for to beholden as
thou art. and if need be for to suffer gladly despyte and reprove for love of
rightwysnes Upon the self manner when thou felyst stirynges of ire and of
male^colye risyng of heart or any other evil will against thyn even cryste^ for
any manner of cause though it seem reasonable and for charity bewaar of it / and
be ready with thy thought for to refreyne it that it turn not in to flesshly
appetite. aye^ stand it and follow it another in word ne in deed asmoche as
thou may / but as he ryseth smite him down again / and so shall thou slay it
with the sword of dread of god that it shall not grieve the / For wit thou well
in all these stirynges of pride vainglory. envy or any other that as soon as
thou perceyuest it and with displeysaunce of thy will and of thy reyson thou
ayenstonde it thou sleest it. though it be so that it cleue stylle upon thyn
heart against thy will and will not lightly pass away / dread it not / for it
lets thy soul fro pees* but it ^^foyleth not thy soul / Right so upon the
same wise shall you do against all evil stirynges of couetyse. accidye.
glotenye. or lecherye / that thou be always ready with thy reason and thy will
for to reprove hem and dispyse hem /

What thing helpith most a man^is knowing and getith to him that he lackith
and most destroys sin in him / Caplm lxxxxi.
ANd that may thou do the better and the more redily if y^ be besye for to
set thyn heart most upon one thing and that thing is naught else but a
ghostly desire to god for to please him / for to love him. for to know him.
for to see him / and for to have him by grace here in a lityll feeling. and in
the bliss of heaven in a full being / This desire if thou keep it shall well
tell the which is sin and which is not / and which is good and which is
better good / And if thou wolt festen thy thought thereto it shall teache the
all that the needs / and it shall get the all that the wants / And therefore
when you shalt rise against the ground of sin in general or else in any
special sin. hang fast upon this desire. and set the point of thy
thought more upon god whom thou desyrest than upon the sin which thou
repreuest / For if thou do so then^e fyteth god for the / and he shall
destroy syn^e in the. Thou shall much sooner come to thy pourpoos if thou do
so tha^ if thou leave thy meke desire to god pryncypally. and will set thyn
heart oonly against the stirynge of sin / as though thou would destroy it
by maystry of thyself / thou shall never so bring it abowte /

How a man shall be shapen to the image of Ihesu / and Ihesu shapen in him /
Caplm lxxxxii.
But do as I have said and better if thou may / And I hope by the grace of
Ihesu thou shall make the deuell a shamed / And all such wicked stirynges
thou shall break away / that they shall not much grieve the / And upon this
manner wise may the image of sin be broken down in the and destroyed: by
the which thou art forshapen fro the kyndely shappe of crystis image / And
thou shall be shappen again to the image of Ihesu man by meekness and charity
and then shall thou be full shapen to the self image of god here living by a
shadow in contemplaco^n and in the bliss of heaven in full sothfastnesse. Of
this shapynge to the lyknes of christ spekith saint poul thus / Filioli quos
iterum perturio donec xp^s formetur in vobis / Gal. iiii
My dear chyldern which I bear as a woman bears her child unto christ be
ayenshape^ in you / Thou have conceived christ by troth and he has life in
the in asmoche as thou have a good will and a desire for to serve him and plese
him / but he is not yet full shapen in the ne thou in him by fullness of
charity / And therefore saint poul bare the and me and other also with traueyle
as a woman bears a child unto ye time that christ has his full shape in us
and we in him /

How a man shall be shapen to the image of Ihesu and Ihesu shapen in him / Caplm
lxxxxii.
WHo so weneth for to come to the werching and to the full use of contemplaco^n
and not by this way / that is for to say not by full head of virtues he
comyth not by the door and therefore as a theyf he shall be cast out / I say
not but yt a man may by the yefte of god have by times a taastyng and a
glemeryng of life contemplatyf / Some man in the beginning / But the sad
felyng of it shall he not have / for christ is the door and he is porter / and
wythouten his leave and his lyuereye may there no man come in as he says
himself / John. iiii /
Nemo venit ad patre^ nisi per me / No man comyth to the fader but by me /
That is for to say / No man may come to the contemplacyon of the godhede but
he be first reformed by fullness of meekness and charity to the kycknesse of
Ihesu in his manhede /

The cause why this book was made. And how she should have her in redynge
thereof that it was made to / Caplm lxxxxiii.
LOo I have told the a lityll as me thinks. first of co^templatyf life what
it is / and sithen of the ways which by grace leden thereto / naught for I
have it in felyng and in werchyng as I have it in saying / Nevertheless I
would by these words such as they aren / first styre mine own necligence
for to do better than I have done / And also my purpoos is for to styre the or
any other man or woman that has taken the state of life contemplatyf for to
traueyle more besily and more mekely in that manner of life by such simple
words as god has give me grace for to say / And therefore if any word be
therein that styreth the or comfort the more to the love of god / thank god.
for it is his gift. and not of the word / And if it comfort the not or else
thou take it not redely / study not tolonge theraboute but lay it beside
the till a another time / and give the to thy prayer or to other ocupaco^n /
Take it as it woll come and not all at ones / Also thise words that I write
take hem not to streytly but there that the thynkith by good auysement that I
speak to shortly either for lacking of english or wantyng of reason I pray
the amend it oonly where need is / Also these words that I write to the they
longen not all to a man that has actyf life / but to the or to any other
which has the state of life contemplatyf /

Here after folowyth the second book of master walter^ Hylton /
That a man is the image of god after the soul and not after the body / Caplm
primum
FOr asmoche as thou couetyst greatly and askyst it for charity for to here more
of an image the which I have before times in party discriued to the /
therefore I will gladly with dread fall to thy desire / and helpyng the grace of
our lord Jesus christ. in whom I fully trust. I shall open to the a lityll more
of this image / At the beginning if thou wylt wit plainly what I mean by this
image. I tell the forsooth that I vndstonde naught else but thyn own soul /
For thy soul and my soul and every reasonable soul is an image. and that a
worthy image / for it is the image of god as the apostle says / Vir est ymago
dei / That is to say / A man is the image of god. ^
and made to the image and to the lyknes of him / not in the bodily shappe
without but in the myghtes of it within as holy writ says. Formauit deus
homine^ ad ymagine^ and similitudine^ sua^ / That is / Our lord god shope man
in his soul to his own image and lyknes. This is the image that I have spoken
of / This image made to the image of god in the first shapyng was wonderly fair
and bryghte full of brennyng love and ghostly light. but thorugh sin of ye
first man adam it was disfygured and forshapen in to a nether lyknes as I have
before said. For it fell fro ye ghostly lyte and that heavenly fode in to
paynfull derknes and lust of this wretchyd life / exyled and flemyd out fro
the heritage of heaven that it should have had if it had stand stylle in to ye
wretchydnes of this earth: and afterward in to the prison of hell there to
have be without end / Fro the which prison to ye heavenly heritage it might
never have come agayen but if it had be reformed to the first shappe and the
first lickenes But that refourmynge might not be made by none erthly man /
for every man was in the same myscheyff / And none might suffyse to help
himself and so much less a another man / Therefore it needs to be done by
him that is more than man that is oonly god / and that was skylfull that he
should refourme and restore man to bliss if he should be saaf / which of his
endless goodness first shope him thereto How then it might be reformed. and
how it is reformed to the first lyckenes by him that fourmed it by the grace
of god I shall tell the / For that is the entente of this writing /

How it neded to mankind that oonly thorugh the passion of christ it should be
restored and reformed that was forshape by the first sin / Caplm ii.
THe ryghtwysnes of god asks that a trespace done be not foryeuen but if
amends be made for it if it may be done / Now it is sooth. mankind that was
hole in adam the first man trespassed ayenste god so wonder grievously when it
forfeyted the special byddyng of him / and assented to the false counseylle of
the fend. that it deserved ryghtfully for to have be departed fro him and
dampened to hell with outen end. so ferforth that stondynge the ryghtwysnesse
of god it might not be foryeuen. but if amends were first made and full
satysfaccyon therefore / But this amends might no man make that was man
oonly. and comen out of adam by kyndely generacyon for this skylle / For the
trespass and vnworshyppe was endless great / and therefore it passyd mannys
might for to make amends for it / And also for this skylle / He that has
trespassed and shall make amends him behouyth for to give to him that he has
trespassed unto all that he owyth though he had not trespassed / And also over
that him behouyth give so^what that he owyth not but oonly for that he
trespassed / But mankind had not wherewyth that he might pay god for his
trespaas over that he ought him / For what good deed that man might do in
body or in soul it was but his debt / For every man ought as the gospel
says for to love god with all his heart and al his soul and all his myghtes /
and better might he not do than this / And nevertheless this deed suffyced not
to the refourmynge of mankind / Ne this might he not do but if he had be
first reformed / Then neded it that if man's soul should be reformed /
and the trespaas made good / that our lord god himself should refourme this
image / and make amends for this trespaas sythen that no man might / But
that might he not do in his godhede / for he might not ne ought not to make
amends by sufferynge of pain in his own kind / therefore it neded that he
should take the same mankind that had trespassed and become man. And that
might he not do by the common law of generation. For it was impossyble goddis
sone to be borne of towchyd woman / Therefore him must become man thorugh a
gracyous generacyon by the werkynge of the holy ghost of a clean gracyous
maiden our lady saint Mary / and so was it done / For our lord Ihesu goddis
sone became man / and thorugh his precious death that he suffered made amends to
the fader of heaven for mannys gylte / And that might he well do for he was
god. and he ought not for himself / but in as much as he was man borne of
the same kind that adam was that first trespaced And so though he ought it
not for his own person / for himself might not sin / Nevertheless he
ought it of his free will for the trespaas of mankind / the which mankind
he took for the salvation of man of his endeles mercy / For soth it is. there
was never man that might yield to god any thing of his own that he ought
not. but oonly this blessed Ihesu. For he might pay god one thing that he
ought not as for himself / and that was naught but one thing. that was to
give his precious life by wylfull taking of death for love of sothfastnes /
This ought he not / As much good as he might do to the worship of god in
this life: all were but debt / But for to take death for love of ryghtwysnesse
he was not bound thereto / He was bound to ryghtwysnesse / but he was not
bound to deye / for death is oonly a pain ordained to man for his own sin
/ But our lord Ihesu sinned never ne he might not sin / and therefore he
ought not for to deye / Then sythen he ought not for to deye. and yet
wilfully he deyed / then paid he to god more than he ought / And sythen that
was the best man's deed and most worthy that ever was done / therefore was it
reasonable that the sin of mankind should be foryeuen / In as much as man
kind had found a man of the same kind without wem^e of sin / that is
Ihesu that might make amends for the trespaas done and might pay our lord
god all that he ought and over more that he ought not / Then sith that our
lord Ihesu god and man deyed thus for salvation of man's soul. it was
ryghtfull that sin should be foryeuen / and man's soul that was his image
should mow be reformed and restored to the first lyckenesse and to the bliss
of heaven / This passion of our lord and this precious death is the ground of
all the refourmynge of of man's soul / without which might never man's
soul have be reformed to the lyckenesse of him. ne come to the bliss of
heaven / But blessed may he be in all his werkynge / Now is it so that thorugh
the virtue of his precious passion the brennyng sword of Cherubyn that drove
adam out of paradyce is now put away. and the endless gates of heaven arn open
to every man that will enter in thereto / For the person of Ihesu is both god
and king of heaven in the bliss to the fader / and as man he is porter at the
yate ready to receive every soul that will be reformed here in this life to his
lyckenesse / For now may every soul if that he will be reformed to the
lyckenesse of god / sith that the trespaas is foryeuen / and the amends
thorugh Ihesu is made for the first gilte / Nevertheless though this be sothe
all souls have not the profit ne the fruit of this precious passion / ne ame
not reformed to the lickenes of him

That Jews and paynems and also false christian men ben not reformed
effectuelly thorugh the virtue of the passion for her owe defawte / Caplm iii.
TWo manner of men arne not reformed by the virtue of this passion / One is of
hem that trow it not / An other is of hem that love it not / Jews and paynems
have not the benefyce of this passion / for they trow it not / Jews trow not
that Ihu^ the sone of the virgyn mary is goddis sone of heaven / Also the
paynems trow not that the souereyne wisdom of god would become the sone of man.
and in man head would suffer the pains of death / And therefore the Jews held
the prechynge of the cross and of the passion of christ naught but sclaunder
and blasphemye / and the paynems held it naught but fantome and folly / But
true christian men held it the souereyne wysdom of god and his great might Thus
said saint poul / Predicamus vobis cristu^ crucifirum iudeis quidem scandalu^.
gentibus autem stulticiam. ip^is aute^ vocatis iudeis and grecis xp^m dei
virtutem et dei sapienciam That is we preche to you that ye trow that Ihesu
christ crucyfyed the sone of mary is goddis sone souereyne virtue and wysdom of
god / the which Ihesu to Jews and paynems that trow not in him is but
sclaunder and folly / And therefore thise men by her untruth putten hemselfe
fro the refourmynge of her own soul / and stondynge her untruth shall they
never be saaf ne come to the bliss of heaven / For sothe it is / fro the
beginning of the world unto the last ending was there never man saaf ne
shall be saaf but if he had troth general or special in Ihesu christ / to
come or I come / For right as all chosen souls that were before the
Incarnaco^n under the old testamente hadden truth in christ that he should
come and refourme man's soul / either openly as patryarkes and prophets and
other holy men had / or else pryuely and generally as chyldern and other
simple and inperfyte souls hadden that knew not specially the pryuyte of the
Incarnacyon / Right so all chosen souls under the new testamente has
truth in christ that he is come / either openly and felyngly and ghostly men
and wise men have / or else generally as chyldern have that deyen crystned /
and other simple and lewd souls have that arne nourysshed in the bosom of
holy church / Sith this is sothe then thinks me that these men greatly and
grievously erren / that sayen that Jews and sarrasyns by keeping of her own
law may be made saaf / though they trowen not in Ihesu christ / as holy
church trowyth / In as much as they wene that her own troth is good and
syker and suffysaunt to her salvation. And in that truth they done as it
semyth many good deeds of ryghtwysnesse / And perauenture if they knew that
christian faith were better than her own is / they would leave her own and take
it / therefore that they should be saaf / Nay it is not enough so / For christ
god and man is both way and end / And he is medyatour betwyx god and man /
And without him may no soul be reconsyled / ne come to the bliss of heaven
/ And therefore they that trowen not in him that is both god and man may never
be saaf ne come to bliss / Other men also that louen not christ nor his
passion arne not reformed in the soul to the lycknesse of him / And thise men
arne falls christian men the which arne out of charytee / and lyuen and deyen in
dedely sin / These men trowen well as it semyth that Ihesu is goddis sone /
And that his passion suffysyth to saluaco^n of man's soul / And they trow
also all the other artycles of the faith / But it is an vnshaply truth and a
deed: for they love him not. ne they chese not the fruit of his passion / but
they lain stylle in her sin and in the false love of this world unto her
last end / And so they ben not reformed to the lyckenesse of god. but goon
to the pains of hell endelesly. as Jews and sarrasyns done / and in to much
more gretter pain than they / In as much as they had the truth and kept it
not / For that was more trespaas than that they had never had it / Then if
thou wolte wit which souls arne reformed here in this lyffe to the image of
god thorugh the virtue of his passion / soothly oonly those that trowen in him
/ and louen him / in which souls the image of god that was thorugh sin
forshapen^ as it were in to a foul bestes lyckenes is restored and reformed
to the first shape / and to the worthynes and worship that it had in the
beginning / without which restorynge and refourmyng shall never soul be saaf
ne come to bliss /

Of two manner of refourmynges of this image / one in fullness. a another in
faith / Caplm iiii.
NOw say thou how may this be soth that the image of god. the which is
man^es soul might be reformed here in this life to his lyckenesse in any
creature / It semyth nay. it might not be so / For if it were reformed
then should it have stable mind / clear syghte and clear brennynge love in
god and ghostly things euerlastyngly as it had in the beginnynge / But that is
no creature as thou trowest living here in this life / For as against thyself
thou can well say the think the full far therfro / Thy mind thy reason
and the love of thy soul arne so much set in beholdynge and in love of
erthly things / that of ghostly things thou felyst right little / Thou
felyste no refourmynge in thyselfe / but thou art so vnbilapped with this
black image of syn^e for ought that you may do. that upon what side you the
turn thou felist thiself defoyled and spotted with flesshly stirynges of this
foul image: other chau^gyng felyst you none fro flesshlynes in to ghostlines
neither in pryue mytes of thy soul wc in ne in bodyly feeling without /
wherefore ye thynken that it might not be that this image might be reformed /
Or else if it might be reformed / Then^e ask thou how it might be
reformed / To this I answer and say thus. There is two manner of refourmyng
of the image of god which is man's soul / One is in fullness / A another is
in party / Refourmynge in fullness may not be had in this life / but it is
delayed after this life to the bliss of heaven / where man's soul shall fully
be reformed. not to that state that it had at the first beginning by kind.
or might have had thorugh grace if it had stand hole / But it shall be
restored to much more bliss and much hyer Joy thorough the great mercy and
the endless goodness of god than it should have had if it had never fallen / For
then shall the soul receive the hole and the full feeling of god in all
myghtes of it. without medelynge of any other affection / And it shall see
mankind in the person of Ihesu above the kind of angels onyd to the godhede
/ For then shall Ihesu both god and man be all in all / and oonly he. and
none other but he as the prophet says Dominus solus exaltabitur in illa die /
That is our lord Ihesu in that day that is everlasting day shall be hyghed
oonly. and none but he / And also the body of man shall then^e be gloryfyed /
For it shall receive fully the rich dowary of vnde delynes with all that
longs thereto / This shall a soul have with the body / and much more than I
can say. But that shall be in the bliss of heaven and not in this life / For
though it be so that the passion of our lord be cause of all this full
refourmynge of man's soul / nevertheless it was not his will for to grant
this full refourmynge right anon after his passion to all chosen sowles that
were living in time of his passion / But he delayed it unto the last day And
that was for this skylle / Sooth it is that our lord Ihesu Christ of his
mercy has ordained a certain number of souls to salvation which nombre was
not fulfilled in the time of his passion / And therefore it neded that by length
of time thorugh kyndly generacyon of men it should be fulfilled. Then if it
had so be that as sone after the death of our lord every soul that would
have trowed in him should by his life have be blessed and full reformed
without any other abidynge / there would no creature that lived then^e have be
that he ne would have received the faith for to have be made blessed / and
then should generacyon have ceased. And so should we that are now chosen
souls living and other souls that come after us not have been borne / and so
should our lord have failed of his number / But that may not be / And
therefore our lord purueyed much better for us in that that he delayed the
full refourmyng of man's soul till the last end. as saint poul says / Deo
pro nobis melius prouidente. ne sine nobis consu^marentur / That is. He^^*
Our lord purueyeth better for us in the delay of our refourmynge than if he
had granted it then / For this skylle that the chosen souls here beforn
should not make a full end without us that come after / A another skylle is
this / For sith that man in his first fourmynge of god was set in his free
will and had free chesyng whether he would have fully god or noo^ It was
therefore reasonable that sith he would not chese god then^e but wretchydly fell
from him / If he should afterward be reformed that he should be set again
in the same free chesinge that he was first in. whether he would have the
profit of his refourmynge or no / And this may be a skylle why man^es soul
was not reformed fully as fast after the passion of Ihesu christ /

That refourmyng in party is in two manners. one in faith a another in feeling /
Caplm v.
A Another reforming of this image is in party: and this refourming may be had
in this life: and but if it be had in this life it may never be had. ne the
soul may never be saaf / But this refourmynge is on two manners / One is in
faith oonly. A another is in faith and in feeling. The first refourmynge in
faith oonly suffiseth to salvation / The second is worthy to have passing
mede in the bliss of heaven / The first may be had lightly and in short time
/ The second may not so but thorugh length of time and much ghostly
traueyle / The first may be had with the feeling of the image of sin / for
though a man feel no thing in himself but all stirynges of sin and
flesshly desires. not ayenstondynge that feeling / if he wylfully assente not
thereto he may be reformed in faith to the lycknesse of god / But the second
reformyng puttyth out the likyng in feeling of flesshly stirynges and worldly
desires / and suffers no such spots abide in this image / The first
refourmynge is oonly of beginning and profitynge souls. and of actyf men / The
second is of perfyte souls and of contemplatyf men^ For by the first
refourmynge the image of sin is not destroyed. but it is left as it were all
hole in feeling / But the second refourmyng destroys the old felynges of
this image of syn^e / and brings in to the soul new gracyous felynges
thorugh the werkynge of the holy ghost / The first is good. the second is
better / but the third that is in the bliss of heaven is moos best / First
let us speak of that one and sith of that other / and so we shall come to the
third.

That thorugh the sacrament of baptym that is grounded in the passion of Christ
this is reformed fro origynall sin / Caplm vi.
TWo manner of sins makith a soul to lose ye shape and the lyknes of god.
That one is called origynall yt is the first syn^e. the other is called actuel
yt is wylfully done sin. these ii. sins put away a soul fro ye bliss of
heaven. and da^pneth it to thendles pain of hell. but if it be thoru the grace
of god reformyd to his lyckenesse or it pass hens out of this life /
Nevertheless two remedies aren there against thise two sins / by the which a
forshapen soul may be restored again / One is the sacrament of baptym
ayenste origynall sin / a another is the sacrament of penance ayenste
actuell sin / A soul of a child that is borne and is vncrystenyd by cause
of origynall sin has no lyckenesse of god / He is naught but an image of
the fend and a bronde of hell. But as soon as it is crystened it is
reformed to the image of god / and through the virtue of faith of holy church
suddenly it is turned fro the lyckenesse of the fend and made like an angel
of heaven. Also the same falls to a Jew or to a farracyne the which or they
ben crystened arne naught but mancyples of hell / But when they forsaken her
error and fallen mekely to the truth in christ. and receive the baptym of
water in the holy ghost. sothly without any more taryeng they arne reformed
to the lickenesse of god so fully as holy church troweth. that if they might
as soon after baptym pass out of this world. they should streyghte flee to
heaven without any more lettyng / had they done never so much sin before in
the time of her untruth / and never should they feel the pay^ne of hell ne
of purgatori / And that pryuelege should they have by the merit of crystis
passion /

That thorugh the sacrament of penance that stond^^h in contricyon confession
and satisfaccion this image is reformed fro actual sin / Caplm vii.
ALso what christian man or woman that has lost the lickenesse of god thorough a
dedely sin brekynge god^dis commandments / if he thorugh towchynge of
grace sothfastly forsake his sin with sorrow and contricion of heart. and be
in full will for to amend him / and torn him to good living / And in this
foresaid will receyuyth the sacrament of penance if he may / Or if that he
may not he is in will thereto. Sothly I say that this man's soul or woman's
that was forshapen first to the lyknesse of the devil thorugh dedely sin is
now by the sacrament of penance restored and shapen again to the image of our
lord god / This is a great curteysie of our lord and an cudeles mercy that
so lightly foryeuyth all manner of sin / and so suddenly yeuyth plente of
grace to a synful soul that askyth mercy of him / He abides not great
penance dooyng ne paynful flesshly sufferyng or he foryeue it / But he askyth
a lothynge of sin and a full forsakyng in will of the soul for the love of
him. and a tournynge of the heart to him / This askith he / for this yeuyth he
/ And then^e when he sees this without any delayenge. he foryeuyth the sin
and refourmyth the soul to his lyknesse / The sin is foryeuen that the soul
shall not be dampened / Nevertheless the pain detted for the sin is not yet
fully foryeuen / but if contryco^n and love be the more / And therefore shall he
goo and show him and shryue him to his ghostly fader. and receive penance
enjoined for his trespaas. and gladly fulfill it. so that both the syn^e and
the pain may be done away or he pass hens / And that is the skylfull
ordinance of holy church for great profit of man's soul. that though the
sin be foryeuen thorugh the virtue of contricyon / nevertheless in
fulfyllyng of meekness: and for to make hole satysfaccyon he shall if he may
show to his priest plener confession / for that is his token and his warraunte
of foryeuenesse ayenste all his enmyes. and yt is needful for to have / For if
a man had forfeyted his life ayenste a king of this earth it were not enough
to him as for a full sykernesse for to have oonly foryeuenesse of the king /
but if he have a charter the which may be his token and his warraunte
against all other men / Right so may it be said ghostly / If a man have
forfeyted against the king of heaven his lyffe thorough dedely sin / It is
not enough to him to full sykernesse for to have foryeuenes of god oonly by
contricyon between god and him. but if he have a charter made by holy church
if he may come thereto And that is the sacrament of penance the which is his
charter and his token of foryeuesse / For sith that he forfeyted both ayenste
god and holy church it is skillful that he have foryeuenesse for that one and a
warrant for that other / And this ^o skylle why that confession is needful / A
another skyll is this / For sith this reformyng of the soul sto^dyth in faith
oonly and not in feeling / therefore a flesshly man that is rude and boystouse
and can not deem lightly but outward of bodily things should not mow have
trowyd that his sins had been foryeuen him but if he had some bodily token.
and that is confession thorugh the which token he is made all syker of
foryeuenes if that he do that in him is / This is the troth of holy church
as I understand it / Also a another skyll is this / Though the ground of
foryeuenesse stand not pryncipally in confession but in contryco^n of the
heart. and in forthynkyng of sin / nevertheless I hope that there is many a
soul that shold^ never a felyd very contryco^n. nor had full forsakynge (...)
if confession had not be / For it fallyth oftsythes that (...) time of
confession grace of compu^ccyon comyth to a (...) that before never felid
grace. but ever was cold and d^y^ and ferder fro felyng of grace / And
therefore sith confession (...) so profitable to the more party of christian men
holy (...) ordained for the more sykernesse generally to all christian men that
every man and woman should ones in the year at the lest be shryuen of all her
sins that come to her mind to her ghostly fader^ though they had never so
much contryco^n before time / Nevertheless I hope well that if all men had
been as besye abowte the keeping of them self in eschewynge of all manner of
sin / And had comen to as much great knowing and feeling of god as some man
has / That holy church should not have ordened the token of confession* as
for needful bond for it had not neded / But for all men arn not so perfyte.
and perauenture much of the more party of christian men is imperfect. therefore
holy church ordained confession^ by way of general bond to all christian men
that will know holy church as her mother. and woll be buxome to her biddynge /
If this be soth as I hope it is then^e erreth he gretely that generally says
that confession of sins for to show a priest is neither needful to a syn^er
ne behofull / and that no man is bound thereto / For by that that I have said
it is both needful and spedfull to all souls that in this wretchyd life are
defoyled / thorugh syn^e / and namely to those that arn thorugh dedely syn^e
forshapen fro the lyknes of god which may not be reformed to his lyknes but
by the sacrament of penance that pryncypally stondeth in contrico^n and sorrow
of heart / and secundary in shryfte of mouth following after if it may be had /
Upon this manner by this sacrament of penance is a sinful soul reformed to
the image of god and to his lyknesse /

How in the sacrament of baptym and of penance thorugh a pryue vnperceyuable
worchyng of the holy ghost this image is reformed though it be not seen ne
felt / Caplm viii.
But this reformyng sto^deth in faith and not in felyng / For right as the
propirte of the faith is for to trow that you see not. right so it is for to
trow that thou felyst not. But he that is reformed in his soul by the
sacrament of penance to the image of god he felith no chau^gyng in him self
neither in his bodily kind without ne in the pryue substance of the soul
within other than he did. for he is as he was unto his felyng / and he felyth
the same stirynges of syn^ and the same corrupcion of his flesh in passions
and worldly rysyng in his heart as he did before / And nevertheless he shall
trow that he is thorugh grace reformed to the lyknes of god though he another
feel it ne see it / He may well feel sorrow for his syn^e and a tornynge of his
will fro syn^e to clen^esse of living if that he have grace and take good keep
of himself but he may another see ne feel the refourmynge of his soul how it
is wonderly and vnperceyuably changed fro the fylthe of the fe^de unto the
fayrnes of an angel thorugh a pryue gracyous werchyng of the holy ghost / That
may he not see but he shall trow it / And if he trow it. then is his soul
reformed in truth / For right as holy church trowith by ye sacrament of
baptym sothfastly received a Jew or a sarrasyn or a child borne is reformed
in soul to the lyckenesse of god thorugh a pryue vnperceyuable werchyng of the
holy ghost / not ayenstondyng all the flesshly stirynges of his body of sin.
the which he shall feel after his baptym as well as he did before. Right so
by the sacrament of penance mekely and truly received a falls criste^ man that
has be encombred with dedely sin all his life time is reformed in his soul
within vnperceyuably. out taken a tournyng of his will thorugh a pryue might
and a gracyous werchyng of the holy ghost that suddenly werchith / and in time
of a monent or a twynkelyng of an eye ryghttyth a froward soul. and tourneth
it fro ghostly fylthe to fayrnes vnseable / and of a servant of the (...)
makyth a sone of Joy / and of ye prisoner of hell makyth a perceyuer of
heavenly heritage not ayenstondyng all the fle^shly feeling of this sinful
image that is the bodily kind* For thou shall vndstonde that the sacrament of
baptym or of penance is not of that virtue for to let and destroy utterly all the stirynges of flesshly lusts and paynfull passions that a man's soul
never feel no manner risyng ne styrynges of hem no time / For if it were so
then were a soul fully reformed here to the worship of the first making /
But that may not be fully in this lyffe / But it is of that virtue that it
cleanses the soul fro all the sins before done / And if it be departed fro
the body sauyth it fro da^pnacion. And if it dwell in the body it yeuyth the
soul grace to ayenstonde ye stirynges of sin / and it kepyth it in grace
also that no manner of lusty stirynges or of passions that it felyth in the
flesh be it never so grievous shall dear it ne depart it fro god as long as
it wylfully sentyth not thereto / Thus saint poul meaned when he said thus /
Nichil dampnaco^nis in hiis qui no^ scdm carnem ambulant / That is. Ro^ viii.
These souls that arne reformed to the image of god in faith thorugh the
sacrament of baptym or of penance shall not be dampened for felynges of this
image of sin / if it so be that they goo not after ye stirynges of the
flesh by deed doing /

That we should believe steadfastly refourmynge of this image. if our conscience
witness to us a full forsakyng of sin. and a true torning of our will to
good living / Ca^ ix.
OF this refourmynge in faith spekyth saint poul thus Iustus ex fide viuit /
The rightwisman lives in faith That is. (...). x.
He that is made rightful by baptym or by penance he lives in faith / which
suffyseth unto saluaco^n and to heavenly pees as saint poul says / Iustificati
ex fide pacem habemus ad deu^ / That is: Ro^ v.
we that arne ryghted and reformed thorugh faith in christ has pees and
accord made betwyx god and us. naught ayenstondynge the vycious felynges of
our body of sin / For though this reformyng be pryue and may not well be
felt here in this life / nevertheless who so trowyth it steadfastly. and
shapyth his works bisely for to accord to his troth / and that he turn not
again to dedely syn^e Soothly when the hour of death comyth. and the soul is
departed fro this bodily life then shall he find it sooth that I say now /
Thus said saint Ioh^n in comfort of chosen souls that lyuen here in faith
under the feeling of this painful image / Barissimi. and nunc sumus filii dei:
sed non du^ apparuit quid erimus / Scimus aute^ qm^ cum cristus apparuit tunc
apparebimus cum eo similes ei in gloria / That is: My dear friends we arne now
while we live here the sons of god / for we arn reformed by faith in christ
to his lyckenes But it shewyth not yet what we arn / but it is all pryue /
Nevertheless we know well that when our lord shall show him at the last
day / then shall we appear with him like unto him in endless Joy / If thou
wolte wit then if thy soul be reformed to the image of god or no / by
that I have said thou may have entree / Ransake thy conscience. and look what
thy will is / for there in stondeth all / If it be turned fro all manner of
dedely sin. that thou woldeste for noothynge wyttyngly and wylfully break the
commandment of god / And for that thou haste mysdone here before ayenste his
biddynge thou haste shryuen the thereof mekely with full heart to leave it / and
art sorry that thou dydest it / I say then sykerly that thy soul is
reformed in faith to the lyckenesse of god /

That all the souls that lyuen mekely in the faith of holy church / and have
her faith quyckened in love and cha^ryte ben reformed by this sacrament /
though it be so that they may not feel the special yefte of devotion or of
ghostly feeling / Caplm x^
IN this refourmynge that is oonly in faith the (...) part of chosen souls
leden her life that sette^ her will steadfastly for to flee all manner of dedely
sin / and for to k^pe hem in love and charity to her even christian / and for
to kep^ the commandments of god after her cunning / And when it so is that
wicked stirynges and evil wylles risen in her hertes of pride or of envy of
ire or lecherye / or of any other head sin they ayenstonde hem and stryuen
against hem by dysplesynge of will / so that they follow not in deed these
wicked wylles / And nevertheless if they fall lightly as it were ayenste her
will thorugh freelte or vncu^nynge / as soon her conscience greuyth hem and
pynyth hem so grievously that they mow have no rest till they be shryuen and
may have foryeuenes / Sothly all thise souls that thus lyuen in this
refourmynge and ben found therein. in the hour of death they shall be saaf /
and come to the full refourmynge in the bliss of heaven / though it be so that
they might never have ghostly feeling ne Inward savor. ne special grace of
deuoco^n in all her life time / For else if thou say that no soul shall be
saaf but it were reformed in ghostly feeling that it might feel deuoco^n and
ghostly savor in god as some souls done thorugh special grace. then^e should
few souls be saaf in reward of multitude of other / Nay it is not for to
trow that that for the souls that oonly arn devout. and by grace come to
ghostly felyng. and for no moo our lord Ihesu should have take mankind / and
suffered that hard passion of death. It had be a lityll purchaas to him for to
have come fro so far to so nere / and fro so hye to so low for so few
souls Nay his mercy is spradde larger than so / Nevertheless on the contrary
wise if thou trow that the passion of our lord is so precious. and his mercy
somoche that there shall no soul be dampened. and namely of no christian man do
he never so evil as some fools wene / soothly thou erreste gretely /
Therefore goo in the mean and hold the in the mids. and trow as holy church
trowyth / And that is that the most sinful man that lives in earth if he
torn his will thorugh grace fro dedely sin with sothfaste repentance to the
seruyse of god / he is reformed in his soul / And if he deyed in that state
he shall be saaf / Thus behighte our lord by his prophet saying thus / In
quacu^que hora conuersus fuerit peccator and ingemuerit. E^ xxviii
vita viuet et non morietur / That is / In what time that it be that the
synful. man is turned to god fro syn^e and he have sorrow therefore he shall
live. and he shall not deye endelesly / And on the other side who so liuyth in
dedely syn^e and will not leave it ne amend him thereof: ne receive the
sacrament of penance / or else if he receive it he takyth it not soothfastly
for the love of god / that is for the love of virtue and clennesse but oonly
for dread or shame of the world / or for dread oonly of pains of hell / he
is not reformed to the lyknesse of god / And if he deye in that plyghte he
shall not be saaf / His troth shall not save him / for his truth is deed and
lackyth love. and therefore it seruyth him not / But they that have troth
quyckened with love and charity arn reformed to the lyckenesse of god. though
it be but the leest degree of charity. as arn simple souls the which felen
not the yeft of special devotion ne ghostly knowing of god / as some ghostly
men done. but trowen generally as holy church trowith. and knowyth not fully
what that is. for it needs not to hem^ And in that trowyth they keep hem in
love and charytee to her even christian as they may / and fleen all dedely sin
after her cu^nynge / and dooen the deeds of mercy to her even christian All thise
longen to the bliss of heaven / For it is written in the apoc^ thus. Qui
timetis deum pusilli et magni laudate (...) This is / ye that dreden god both
small and great thank him By great arn understand souls that arn profytyng
in (...) or else perfyte in the love of god. the which arn refourm^^ in
ghostly feeling: By small arn understand souls imperfect of worldly men and
wymmen. and other that have but a ch^^dis knowing of god and full lityll
feeling of him. but (...) brought forth in the bosom of holy church and
nourysshed with the sacrament as chylderne arn fed with milk / All thise
should love god and thank him for saluaco^n of her souls by his endeles mercy
and goodness / For holy church that is mother of all these and has tender
love to all her chyldern goostly prays and asks for hem all tenderly of her
spowse that is Ihesu and geteth hem hele of soul thorugh virtue of his passion
/ And namly for hem that can not speak for hem self by ghostly prayer for her
need / Thus I find in the gospel. That the woman of Chanee asked of our lord
hele to her daughter that was traueyled with a fend / and our lord made
first dau^geour by cause she was an alyene / Nevertheless she ceased not for
to cry till our lord had granted her asking. and said to her thus. Aa woman
much is thy troth be it to ye right as you wolt / In the same hour was her
douter hole. This woman betokenith holy church that asks help of our lord
for simple vncu^nynge souls that are traueyled with temptaco^n of the world /
and can not speak perfitly to god by fervor of devotion ne brennyng love in
contemplacyon / And though it seem that our lord make dau^geour first by
cause that they arn as it were alyened fro him / nevertheless for the great
truth and deserte of holy church he grau^teth to her all that she will / And
so arn these simple souls that trowen steadfastly as holy church trowyth /
and putten hem fully in the mercy of god / and meke^ hem under the sacrament
and laws of holy church made saaf thorugh prayer and troth of her mother holy
church /

That souls reformed neden ever to fight and strive ayenste the stirynge of
sin while they lyuen here / And how a soul may wit when it assentyth to
the stiryng. and when not / Caplm xi.
THis refourmyng in faith is lightly gotten / but it may not so lightly behold
/ And therefore what man or woman that is reformed to the sickness of god in
troth much traueylle and business must they have if they will keep this
image hole and clean that it fall not down again thorugh weykenesse of will to
the image of sin / He may not be idle ne reklees for the image of sin is
so nere festnyd to him / and so contynually pressyth upon him by diverse
styrynges of sin / that but if he be right well waare he shall full lightly
thorough assente fall again thereto / And therefore him needs ever be stryuynge
and fighting ayenste wicked stirynges of this image of sin / and that he
make none accord therwyth / ne take no fre^dshyp to it for to be buxum to his
unskillful biddynges / For if he do he begyleth himself But soothly if he
stryueth with hem him needs not much dread of assenting / For strife brekyth
pees and falls accord. It is good that a man have pees with all thing sauf
with the fend and with this image of syn^e / for ayenste hem him needs ever
fight in his thought and in his deed till he have geten on hem the maystry.
and that shall never be fully in this life / as long as he bears and felyth
this image / I say not but that a soul may thorugh grace have the hier hand
over this image so ferforthe that he shall not follow ne sent to the
unskillful stirynges of it / But for to be so clean delyuerde fro this image
that he should feel no suggestyon ne Jangling of flesshly affection ne of
vain thought no time may no man have in this life / I hope that a soul
that is reformed in feeling by rauysshyng of love in contemplacyon of god may
be so far fro the sensualyte and fro vayn ymagynaco^n aad so far drawn
out and departed fro the flesshly feeling for a time that it shall not feel but
god / but that lasts not ever / And therefore say I that every man behooves
stryffe ayenste this image of sin / and namely he that is reformed in faith
oonly that so lightly may be disceyued therwyth / In the person of which
men says saint poul / Caro concupiscit aduersus spiritu^ et spu^s aduersus
came^ That is: ^
A soul reformed to the lickenesse of god fightith ayenste the flesshly
stirynges of this image of sin / and also this image of sin stryueth against
the will of the spirit This manner of fighting of this dowble image saint
poul knew when he said thus / Inueni legem in membris me is repugnante^ legi
mentis me et captiuum me ducentem in legem peccati / That is / I have found
two laws in myself One law in my soul within / and a another in my flesshly
lym^es without fighting with it that often ledeth me as a wretched prisoner to
the law of sin / By thise two laws in a soul I understand this double
image / By the law of the spirit I understand the reason of the soul when
it is reformed to the image of god / By the law of the flesh I understand
the sensualytees which I call the image of sin / To. vii.
In thise two laws a soul reformed ledeth his life as saint poul says /
Me^te enim seruio legi dei. carne enim legi peccati / In my soul that is in my
will and in my reason I serve to the law of god / but in my flesh that is in
my flesshli appetyte I serve to the law of sin / Nevertheless that a soul
reformed shall not dispeyre though he serve to the law of sin by feeling of
the vicyous sensualyte ayenste the will of the spirit by cause of corrupco^n
of the bodily kind. saint poul excusyth it saying thus of his own person /
Non eni^ quod volo bonum hoc ago. ^
sed malum quod odi hoc facio. Si aute^ malum quod odi hoc facio. no^ ego
operor illud sed quod habitat in me peccatu^ / I do not that good that I would
do. That is. I would feel no flesshly stiryng. and that do I not / But I do
that evil that I hate. That is: The synful stirynges of my flesh I hate /
and yet I feel hem / Nevertheless since it is so that I have the wicked
stirynges of my flesh / and yet I feel hem and often delight in hem against my
will they shall not be reherced ayenste me for dampnaco^n as if I had done hem
/ And why? For the corrupcyon of this image of sin does hem^ and not I. ^oo
saint poul in his person comfort al souls that thorugh grace arn reformed
in faith that they sholden not tomoche dread the bourden of this image with
the unskillful stirynges thereof / if it so be they sent not wylfully thereto /
Nevertheless in this point many souls that arne reformed in truth arne
often times much tormented and trowbled in vayn as thus / When they have felt
flesshly stirynges of pride or enuye^ of couetyse or lechery or of any other
head syn^e. they wot not sometime whether they sent thereto or no. and that is
no great wond / For in time of temptaco^n a freel ma^nis thought is so
trowbled and so over laid that he has no clear sight ne fredom of himself /
but is taken often with likyng unwarily. and gooth forth a great while or then^e
he perceive it / And therefore fallen some in dowte and dwere whed they syn^ed
in time of temptacyon or no / As against this point I say as me think / that
a soul may have assayeng in this manner whed that he assente or no / If it
be so that a man is stired to any manner of sin. and the likinge is so great
in his flesshly felyng that it trowblith his reason. and as it were with
maistry ocupyeth the affecco^n of ye soul / nevertheless he kepyth him that he
follows not in deed / (...) he would not if he might but is rather paynfull to
him for (...) feel the likyng of that syn^e. and feign he would put it away
(...) he might / And then^e when ye stiryng is ouerpased he is glad and well
paid that he is delyuerde of it / by this assay may he wit. that were the
likyng never so great in the flesshly felyng that he assented not ne syn^ed
not namly dedely. Nevertheless ^ remedy there is siker to such a simple soul
that is (...) in itself and can not help it ye he be not to bold in himself
(...) wening yt such fleshly stiryng with likyng are no sin^es. (...) he myt so
fall into rechelesnes and into falls sikernes^ Ne (...) yt he be not to dredful
ne to simple in wit for to deem (...) al as dedely sins nor as great
venyals for another is soth. but yt he hold he^ all as sins and wretchidnes
of himself. and that he have sorrow for he^ and be not to besy for to deem he^
another deed li ne venial. But if his conscience be greatly grieved that he
haastly goo and show to his confessor in general or in special such
stirynges. and namly every stiryng that begyn^eth to festen any rote in the
heart and most ocupieth it for to draw it down to sin and worldly vanytee
/ And then when he is thus shryuen generally or specially trow then^e
steadfastly that they ben foryeuen. and dispute no more about hem that arn
passed and foryeuen whether they were dedely or venyall. But that he be more
besye to keep him better against hem that arn coming And if he do thus then^e
may he come to rest in conscience / But then^e some arn so flesshly and so
vncu^nyng that they would feel or see or here her foryeuenes of her sins as
openly as they might feel and see a bodily thing / And for asmoche as they feel
it not so therefore they fall often in such weeres and doubts of hemself and
never may come to rest / and in that arn they unwise. for faith gooth before
felyng / Our lord said to a man that was in the palsy wha^ he helyd him thus /
^
Co^fide fili remittu^t tibi pcca^ tua / That is: Sone trow steadfastly thy
sins arn foryeuen ye / He said not to him see or feel how thy sins arn
foryeue the / for the foryeuenes of sins is done ghostly and vnseable thorugh
the grace of ye holy ghost. but trow it / Right on the same wise. every man
that will come to rest in conscience him behouith first if he do that in him
is trow without ghostly felyng foryeuenes of his sins / And if he first
trow it / he shall afterward thorugh grace feel it. and understand it that
it is so. ^say. vii
Thus said the apostle / Nisi crederitis no^ intelligetis / That is: But if ye
first trow ye may not vndstonde / Troth gooth before and understanding comyth
after / the which understanding that I call the light of god if it be
gracyous a soul may not have but thorough great clen^esse as our lord says
/ Beati mu^do cord qm^ ip^i deu^ vide bu^t / Blessed be clean of heart for
they shall see god. M. v.
not with her flesshly eye but with the Inner eye that is understanding cle^sed
and lyghted thoruh^ grace of the holy ghost for to fee soth fastnes. yt which
clen^es a soul may not feel but if he have stable troth going before as
thapostle says / Fide mu^da^s corda eorum. Act^ xv.
That is our lord cle^seth ye hertes of his chose^ thoruh^ faith / therefore it
is nedfull yt a soul trow first ye reformyng of himself made thorugh the
sacrament of penance thouh^ he see it not / and that he dispose himself fully
for to live rightfully and virtuously as his troth askyth / so that he may
after come to syghte and to the refourmyng in feeling /

That this image is both fair and foul whiles it is in this life here though
it be reformed / And of dyuersyte of felynges pryuely had between thise souls
that been reformed and other that been not / Caplm xii.
Fair is man's soul. and foul is a man's soul / Fair in as much as it is
reformed in faith to the lickenes of god / But it is foul in asmoche as it is
meddled with flesshly felynges and unskillful stirynges of this foul image of
sin / Foul without as it were a be / fair within like to an angel /
Foul in feeling of the sensualyte / fair in troth of the reason / Foul for
the flesshly appetyte. fair for the good will / Thus fair and thus foul is a
chosen soul / saying holy writ thus / Nigra su^ sed formosa filie Ierlm
sicut tabernacula cedar et sicut pellis salomonis / That is. ^
I am black but I am fair and shaply ye daughter of Ierlm as the tabernacles
of cedar as the skyn^e of solomon / That is ye angels of heaven that arn
daughters of the hye Ierlm wonder not on (...) ne dispyce me not for my black
shadow / For though I (...) black without by cause of my flesshly kind as is
a tabernacle of cedar / Nevertheless I am full fair within as the skyn^e of
solomon. for I am reformed to the lyckenes of god / By cedar is understand a
reproved soul the which is a tabernacle of the devil / By solomon is
understand our lord Ihesu For he is pees and peasyble / By the skin of
solomon is understand a blessed angel in whom our lord dwellyth / And is
hid as is the life hid in the skin of a quycke body / And therefore is an
angel lyckened to a skin / Then may a chosen soul with meke trust in
god and gladenes of heart say thus / Though I be black by cause of my body of
syn^e as a reproved soul yt is one of the tabernacles of the fend /
nevertheless I am within full fair thorugh truth and good will like to an
angel of heaven / For so says he in a another place / Nolite considerare me quoth
fusca su^. qm^ decolorauit me sol. Cant. i.
That is: Behold me not that I am swart for the son has defaded me / The
son^e makyth a skin swarte only without and not within / and it betokenith
this flesshly life / Therefore says a chosen soul thus / Repreue me not for I
am swart. for the swartnesse that I have is all without of touching and of
berynge of this image of sin / but it is no thing within / And therefore
soothly though it be so yt a chosen soul reformed in faith dwell in this
body of sin^e and feel the same flesshly stirynges / and use the same bodily
works as does a tabernacle of cedar so ferforth that in man's dome there
should no dyfference be bytwyx that one and that other. Nevertheless within in
her souls there is a full great dyuersite^ and in the syghte of god there is
full much twinnynge / But the knowing of this which is one and which is other
is oonly kept to god* for it passes man's dome and man^es feeling / and
therefore we shall no man deem as evil for that thing that may be used both
evil and well. A soul that is not reformed is take so fully with the love
of the world / and so much ouerlayed with the likynge of his flesh in all
his se^sualyte that he chesyth it as a full rest of his heart. and in his
pryue meaning he would not else have but yt he might ever be syker thereof. He
felith no lycour of grace stiryng him for to loathe his flesshly life ne for to
desire heavenly bliss / And therefore I may say that he bears not this image of
syn^e / but he is borne of it as a man that were seek and so weyke that he
might not bear himself / And therefore he is laid in a bed and borne in a
lytere / Right so such a sinful soul is so weyke and so vnmyghti for
lackyng of grace that he may neither meue hand ne foot for to do any good
deed: ne for to ayenstonde by displesyng of will the leest stirynge of sin
when it comyth / but it falls down thereto as it were a be upon careyne /
But a soul that is reformed though he use his flesshly wits / and feel
flesshly stirynges / nevertheless he lotheth hem in his herte^ for he would
for no thing fully rest in hem / but he flees the rest as the bitynge of
an adder / and had lever have his rest and the love of his heart in god if that
he cowde^ and sometime desires thereto / and often grutcheth of the liking of
this life for love of the life everlasting / This soul is not borne in this
image of sin as a seek man though he feel it. but he beryth it / For thorugh
grace he is made mighty and strong for to suffer and bear his body with all
the evil stirynges of it without hurtynge or defoylynge of himself / and that
is in asmoche as he loves hem not. ne follows hem not^ ne se^teth not to hem
the which arn dedely sins as a another does / This was bodily fulfilled in
the gospel of a man that was in the palsye. and was so feeble that he might
not goo / and therefore was he laid and borne in a lytere and brought to our
lord / And when our lord saw him in myscheyf of his g^^odnesse he said to
him / Surge et toll grabatum tuu^ et (...) in domum tua^ / That is: Rise up
and take thy bed and (...) in to thy house / And so he did. and was hole /
And soothly right as this man bare upon his back when he was made hole the
bed that before bare him / Right so it may be said ghostly that a soul
reformed in faith berith this image of sin the which bare him before / And
therefore be not adradde tomoche of thy blackenesse that thou haste of beryng of
this image of sin. But as ayenste the shame and the dysco^forte that you have
of the beholding of it / and also again vpbraydyng that thou felist in thy heart
of thy ghostly enmyes when they say to the thus / where is thy lord Ihu^s. what
sekest you. where is ye fairnes that you spekest of. what felist you out but
blindness of sin / where is that image of god that thou say is reformed in
the / Comfort thiselfe and be faithful styfly as I have before said / And if
thou do so thou shall by this troth destroy all the temptacyons of thyn
enmyes / Thus said the appostle poul. Accipe scutu^ fidei in quo omnia tela
hostis nequissima poteris extinguere / That is: Eph^. 6.
Take to the a shield of steadfast troth thorugh the which thou may quench
all the brennyng darts of thyn enmye /

Of three manner of men of the which some ben not reformed / and some ben
reformed oonly in faith / and some in faith and in feeling / Caplm xiii.
BY this that I have said may thou see that after diverse parties of the soul
arne diverse states of men / Some men arne not reformed to the lyckenesse of
god / and some arne reformed to the lyckenesse of god / And some arn reformed
only in faith / and some arne reformed in faith and in feeling / For thou
shall understand that a soul has two parties / That one is called sensualyte
and that is flesshly feeling by the five outewarde wits / the which is common
to man and to be / Of the which sensualyte when it is unskillfully and
vnordynatly ruled is made the image of sin / when it is not ruled after
reason / for then is the sensualyte syn^e / That other party is called
reason / and that is departed in two / In the over party and in the nether /
The over party is lickened to a man / for it should be master and souereyne
and that is propirly the image of god / For by that oonly the soul knowyth god
and louyth him / And the neither is lyckened to a woman / for it should be
buxum to the over party of reison / as woman is buxum to man / and that lies
in knowing and rulynge of erthly things: for to use hem discretly after need.
and for to refuse hem wha^ it is no need. for to have ever with it an eye
upward to the ouerpartie of reason with dread and reverence for to follow it.
Now may I say yt a soul that lives after likings and the lusts of his
flesh / as it were an unskillful be. and neither has knowing of god ne
desire to virtues ne to good living. But is all blinded in pride / frette with
envy. ouerlayed with couetyse / defoyled with lecherye / and other great sins
/ Is not reformed to ye lyckenesse of god / for it lies and rests fully in
the image of sin. that is sensualyte / A another soul that dredeth god / and
ayenstondeth dedely stirynges of the sensualyte / and follows hem not / But
lives resonably in ruelynge and governance of worldly things / and sets
his entente and his will for to pleyse god by his outward works is reformed
to the lyknesse of god in faith / And though he feel the same stirynges of
syn^e as that other does / it shall not disease him for he rests not in hem
as that other does / But a another soul that flees thorugh grace all dedely
styrynges of the sensualyte and venyals also ferforth that he felyth hem not is
reformed in feeling / for he folowyth the ouerparty of reason in beholdynge of
god and ghostly thynges^ as I shall tell the afterward /

How men that been in sin forshapen hemselfe in to diverse bestes lyckenesse /
And they be^ called the lovers of the world / Caplm xiiii.
A wretchyd man is he then that knowyth not the worthynesse of his soul ne
will not know it / how it is most worthy creature that ever god made out
take an angel whom it is like to. hye above all other kind bodily. to the
which no thing may suffyse as full rest / but oonly god / And therefore he
should no thing love ne like but him oonly / ne coueyte ne seek but how he
might be refourmyd to his liknes. but for he knowith not this. therefore he
sekyth and coueytith his rest and his likyng outward in bodily creatures werse
than himself is / Unkindly he does and vnresonably he werkith yt leuith the
souereyn good and everlasting life yt is god unsought and vnloued unknown and
vnworshypped. and chesyth his rest and his bliss in a passing delight of an
erthely thing / Nevertheless thus done all the lovers of this world that
have her Joy and her bliss in this wretchyd lyffe / Some have it in pride and
vaynglory of hemself / that when they have lost the dread of god they traueyle
and study night and day how they mow come to worship and praysyng of the
world / and maken no force how it be so that they might come thereto and
ouerpasse all men either in clergy or in craft in name or in fame. In riches
or in reverence. in souereynte and mastershyp. in hye state and lordshyp Some
men have her rest in riches and in outragyous hauour of erthly good. and
sette^ her hertes so fully for to get it. that they seek not else but how
they might come thereto / Some have her likynge in flesshly lusts of glotenye
and lecherye and in other bodily uncleanness / And some in oo thing and some in a
another. And thus wretchydly thise that done thus forshapen hemself fro the
worthynes of man. and torn hem in to diverse bestes lickenes / The proud man
is turned into a lion for pride: for he would be drade and worshypped of all men
/ and that no man ayenstonde ye fulfyllyng of his flesshly will another in
word ne in deed / And if any man would let his mysproude will. he we^ith
fell and wroth. and woll be wroke^ of him as a lion wrekith him on a lityll
be / This man that does thus is no man for he does vnresonably ayenste
the kind of a man / and so he is turned and transfourmed in to a lion /
^nuyous and angry men arn turned in to hounds thorugh wrath / an envy that
berkyth again her even cryste^ and bityth hem by wicked and malicyous words /
and greuytgh hem that have not trespassed with wrongful deeds. harming hem in
body and in soul aye^ste goddis biddyng / Some men arne forshapen in to asses
ye arne slow to the seruyse of god. and evil wylled for to do any good deed
to her even christian / They arn ready enough for to run for worldly profit and
for erthly worship or for pleisau^ce of an erthly man / But for ghostly mede^
for help of her own souls: or for the worship of god they are soon yrke
they woll not thereof / And if they ought done they goon but a pase and with
froward will / Some are turned in to swyne for they are so blind in wit
and so bestly in manners that they have no dread of god: but folowen only the
lusts and lykynges of her flessh^ / and have no reward to the honest of man
/ ne for to rule hem after the biddynge of reason / ne for to restrain the
unskillful stirynges of the flesshly kind. but as soon as a flesshly stirynge
comyth of syn^e they are ready for to fall thereto and follow as swyne done /
Some men are turned in to wulfes that lyuen by raueyn as falls covetous men done
that through maystry and ouerledynge robben her even cri^^^ of her worldly
goods / Some men are turned in to foxes as falls men and deceyuable men that
lyuen in trecherye and gyle / All thise and many other moo that lyue^ not in
dread of god. but breken his commandments forshapen hemself fro the (...) of
god / and maken hem like to bestes^ ye and worse than bestes for they are like
to the fend of hell / And therefore sothly (...) men that lyuen thus if they
ben not reformed when (...) hour of death comes. and the souls of hem are
departed (...) the bodies. then^e shall her eye be opened that is now stopped
with syn^e / and then shall they feel and find the pain of (...)
wretchydnes that they lived in here / And for asmoche as the image of god was
not reformed through the sacrament of penance in hem neither in faith ne in
feeling here in this life they shall be as cursed cast out fro the blessed
face of our creator / and they shall be dampened with the devil in to the
depnesse of hell there for to be without end / Thus says saint Ioh^n in
thapocalipse / Tumidis et incredulis execratis and homicidis fornicatoribus
venificis et ydolatris and om^ibus men dacibus pars illorum erit in stagno
ardenti igne and sulphur. Apoc. ^
That is. To proud men and mystrowyng men to cursed and to me^ sleers. to
lecherous and covetous. to poyseners and worshyppers of mawmetes. and to all
falls liars her dele shall be with the devil in the pytte of hell bre^nynge
with fire and brymston / If ye lovers of this world would often think on this
how all this world shall pass and draw to an end. and how all wicked love
shall be hard punysshed. they should within short time looth all worldly
lusts that they now most like / and they should lift up her heart for to love
god / and they would besyly seek and traueylle how they might be reformed to
his lyckenes or they pass hens /

How lovers of this world unable hem in diverse manners to the refourmyng of her
own soul / Caplm xv
But now says some of hem thus. I would feign love god and be a good man^ and
forsake the love of the world if that I might / but I have no grace thereto.
If I had the same grace that a good man has I should do as he does / But for
I have it not. therefore I may not / and so it is not to me to wit but I am
excused / Unto thise me^ I say thus Soth it is as they say that they have no
grace / and therefore they lain still in her syn^e and may not rise out / But
that avails hem not against god. for it is her own defawte / They unable hem
by diverse ways somoche that the light of grace may not shine to he^ne rest
in her hertes. For some are so froward that they woll no grace hauene they
woll no good men be / For they wot well that if they should be good men they
must needs forbere the great likyng and the lust of this world that they have
in erthly things / and that woll they not. For hem thynken it is so sweet
that they woll not forgoo it /

And also they must needs take works of penance / As in fasting. waking:
prayenge / And many other good deeds dooynge: In chastysynge of their flesh
/ And in wythdrawynge of their flesshly will / and that may they not do / For
it is made so sharp and so dreadful to her thinking that they vggen and
lothen for to think upon it / and so cowardly and wretchydly dwell they
stylle in her syn^e / Some would have grace as it semith and begyn^en to able
hem thereto. but her will is wonder week / For as soon as any stirynge of syn^e
comyth though it be contrary to the biddynge of god. they fall anon thereto /
for they are so bound through custom by often falling and often assenting to
syn^e before: that hem think it impossyble for to ayensto^de it / and so
feyned hardness of perfourmyng weekyth her will. and smytith it down again: So
me also felen stirynge of grace. as when they have bityng of conscience for her
evil living. and that they should leave it But that is so paynfull to hem and
heavy that they woll not suffer it ne abide it: but they flee therfro and
foryete it if they may so ferforth that they seek likynge and comfort
outward in flesshly creatures. so that they should not feel this bityng of
conscience within her soul / And more over some men are so blind and so
bestly that they wene there is none other life but this. ne that there is no
soul other than of a best / and that the soul of a man deyeth with the body
as the soul of a be / and therefore they say: Ete we. drink we: and make
we merry here / for of this life we be^ syker: we see none other heaven / Sothly
such are some wretches that sayen thus in her hertes / though they say it not
with her mouth / Of the which men the prophet says thus / Dixit insipie^s in
cord suo no^ est deus / That is / ^ unwise man said in his heart: there is no
god / This vnw^se man is every wretchyd man that lives and loves syn^e. and
^hesith the love of this world as rest of his soul: he says there is no god
/ not with his mouth. for he woll speak of him some time when he fares well
flesshly as it were in reverence wha^ he says blessed be god / Sometime in
dyspyte when he is angry against god or his eue^ christian. and sweryth by his
blessed body or any of his me^bres / But he says in his thought that there is
no god / and that is either for he weneth that god sees not his syn^e. or
that he will not punysshe it so hard as holy wrytt says / or that he woll
foryeue him that syn^e though he see it not / or else that there shall no
christian man be dampened do he never so evil / Or else if he fast our lady
fast. or say every day a certain oryson / or here every day ii. masses or
iii. or do a certain bodily deed as it were in worship of god. he shall never
goo to hell do he never somoche syn^e though he forsake it not / this man
says in his heart that there is no god / But he is unwise as the prophet
says / For he shall feel and find in pain that he is a god whom he forgate
and set naught by / but set by the well of the world as the prophet says
/ Sola vexacio dabit intellectu^ auditui / That is: ^
Only pain shall give vndstondynge / For he that knowyth not this here ne
woll not know it: shall well know it when he is in pain.

A lityll counseyle how lovers of this world should do if they woll be
reformed in her soul before her partyng hens Caplm xvi.
These men though they wot well that they arne out of grace and in dedely
syn^e they have no care ne sorrow ne thought therefore. But they make flesshly
mirth and worldly solace asmoche as they may / And the ferder they ben fro
grace ye more myrthe they make / and perchance some holde^ hem well paid that
they have no grace that they may as it were the more fully and freely follow
the likyng of flesshly lusts. as though god were a sleep and might not see
hem / And this is one of ye most defawte that may be / And thus by her own
frowardenes they stop the light of grace fro her own soul that it may not
rest therein / the which grace in asmoche as in it is shyneth to all ghostly
creatures ready for to enter in there it is received: as the son^e shyneth over
all creatures bodily ther^ it is not let / thus says saint Ioh^n in the
gospel. Ioh^is: 1.
Lux in true bris lucet et tenebre ea^ non co^prehenderu^t / That is / the
light of grace shyneth in derknesse / that is to men^es hertes that are derke
through sin / But the derknesse takes it not / That is thise blind hertes
receive not ye gracyous light. ne have not the profit of it: But right as a
blind man is vmbilapped with the light of the son^e when he sto^deth therein.
and yet sees it not. ne has no profit thereof for to goo thereby / right so
ghostly a soul blinded with dedely sin is all vmbylapped with this ghostly
light. and yet he is never the better / for he is blinded and woll not see ne
know his blyndenesse / And that is one of the most lettynge of grace. that a
wretchyd man woll not be a know of his own blyndnesse for pride of himself or
else if he know it he charge not. but makyth myrthe and game as he were
over all syker / Therefore unto al thise men that are thus blinded and bound
with the love of this world / and are foul forshape fro the fayrhede of man I
say and counsel that they think on her soule^ and that they able hem unto
grace asmoche as they may. and that may they do upon this wise if that they
woll / When that they feel hemself out of grace and ouerlayed with dedely
syn^e: then that they think what myscheyf and what peril it is to hem for
to be put out of grace and departed fro god as they ben / For there is no thing
that holds hem fro the pytte of hell that they ne should right soon fall
therein but a bare syngyll threde of this bodily life whe^by they hang / what
lyghtlyer may be lost than a sengyl ^h^ede may be broken in two / For were the
breath stopped in her body: and that may lightly fall. her soul shall pass
forth and anon be in hell without end / And if they would think thus they
should quake and shake for dread of the rightful domes of god. and of the
hard punysshyng of syn^e / and they should make sorrow and morn for her syn^e
and for lackyng of grace / and then^e should they cry and pray yt they might
have grace / and if they did thus then^e should grace fall in and put out
derknesse and hardness of heart and weyknes of will / and give hem might and
strength for to forsake the false love of this world as much as is dedely
syn^e / For there is no soul so far fro god thorugh wickidnes of will in
dedely syn^e: I out take none that lives in this body of syn^e that he ne may
through grace be righted and reformed to clennesse of living. if he woll bow
his will to god with meekness for to amend his life. and hertly axe grace and
foryeuenes of him / and excuse our lord* and fully accuse himself / For holy
writ says. Nolo morte^ pcco^ris sed magis vt co^nertat et viuat / That is.
Our lord says: I wol not the death of a syn^er but I woll more that he be
turned to me and live / For our lord woll that the most froward man that
lives forshapen through syn^e if he torn his will and ask grace that he be
reformed to his lyknesse /

That refourmyng in faith and in feeling may not suddenly be gotten by grace and
much bodily and ghostly traueyle in length of time / Caplm xvii.
THis refourmyng is in faith as I have before said that lightly may be had /
But after this comyth refourminge in faith and in feeling that may not lightly
begote but thorugh long traueylle and much business / For refourmynge in
faith is common to all chosen souls though they ben in the lowest degree of
charity / But refourmyng in felyng is specially of thise souls that may come
to the state of perfeccyon and that may not suddenly be had. but after great
plente of grace and much ghostly traueylle a soul may come thereto / and yt
is when he is first helyd of his ghostly syknes /: and when all bitter
passions and flesshly lusts. and other old felynges are burnt out of the
heart with fire of desire and new gracyous felynges arne brought Inn with
brennynge love and ghostly light / Then right nyghe hygheth a soul to
perfeccyon and to refourmynge in feeling /

For soth it is. right as a man yt is brout nigh to death through bodily siknes
though he receive a medicyne by the which he is restored and siker of his life
/ he may not therefore anon rise up and goo to work as an hole may for the
feebleness of his body holds him down that he must abide a good while and
keep him well with medicynes^ and dyete him by mesure after ye ^echynge of a
leche till he may fully recover bodily hele. Right so ghostly^ he that is
brought to ghostly death through dedely syn^e though he through medicyne of the
sacrament of penance be restored to life that he shall not be dampened /
nevertheless he is not anon hole of all his passions and of all his flesshly
desires. ne able to contemplaco^n / but him behooves abide a great while. and
take good keep of himself / and rule him so that he might recover full hele of
soul. for he shall langern a great while or that he be fully hole /
Nevertheless if that he take medicynes of a good leche. and use hem in time with
mesure and discreco^n he shall much the sooner be restored to his ghostly
strength. and come to refourmynge in feeling / For refourmynge in faith is the
lowest state of all chosen souls / for byneth that might they not well be /
But refourmyng in feeling is the hiest state in this life that the soul may
come to But fro the lowest to the highest may not a soul suddenly (...). no more
than a man that woll clymbe upon a ladder (...) sets his foot upon the
lowest stele may at the next flee up to the hyeste / But him behooves goo by
process one after another till he may come to the ouerest / Right so it is
ghostly. no man is made suddenly souereyn in grace: but through long exercise and
slye werkyng of a soul may com thereto / namly when he helpyth and techyth a
wretchyd soul in whom al grace lies / For without special help and Inwardly
techynge of him may no soul come thereto.

The cause why so few souls in rewar^de of the multitude of other comen to
this refourmynge in faith and in feeling / Caplm xviii.
But now say thou. Sith our lord is so curteys of his goodness. and of his
gracyous yeftes so free / wonder it is then^e that so few souls as it
semyth in reward of ye multitude of other may come to this refourmyng in
feeling / It semyth that he were dangerous and that is not sothe / or that he
took no reward of his creatures. the which by taking of faith are become
his servants / Unto this I may answer and say as me thinks. that one
enchesen is this / Many that are reformed in faith sentten not her hertes for
to profit in grace. ne for to seek none hyer estate of good living thruh^
besye traueylle in prayenge and thynkyng. and other bodily and goostly werkyng
/ but hem think it enough to hem to keep he^selfe out of dedely syn^e. and for
to stand stylle in that plyghte as they are in / For they say that it is
enough to hem for to be saaf and have the leest degree in heaven / They wol
coueyte no more / Thus perchance does some of the chosen souls that leden
in the world actyf life / and that is lityll wonder of hem / For they are so
occupied with worldly business that needs for to be done that they may not
fully set her hertes for to profit in ghostly werkynge / And nevertheless it
is peryllous to hem. for they fall out all day / and are now up and now
down. and may not come to the stablynes of good living Nevertheless they are
somewhat excusable for her astate of living / But other men and wym^en that are
free fro worldly business if they woll and may have her nedfull sustynau^ce
with out great bodily besynes. specially as religyous men and wymmen may that
bynden hemself to the state of perfecco^n by taking of relygion. and other men
also in seculer state that have much reason in great kyndly wit. and might
if they would dyspose hem there to come to much grace / Thise me^ are more to
blame. for they stand stylle as they were idle and woll not prouffyte in
grace. ne in no ferder seeking for to come to the love and the knowing of god
^For sothly it is peryllous to a soul that is reformed oonly in faith and
woll no more seek profit. ne give him besily to ghostly traueyle / for he
may so lightly lose that he has. and fall again to dedely syn^e. For a soul
may not stand still always in one state while that it is in the flesh / For
it is either profitynge in grace or peyrynge in syn^e / For it fares by him as
it does by a man that were draw out of a pytte. and when he were up he would
no ferd goo than the pyttes brynke / Sothly he were a much fool. for a
lityll puff of wind or an unwarily stiryng of himself should soon cast him
down again wors tha^ he was before / Nevertheless if he flee fro ye brynke as
far as he may and goo forth on the earth. then^e though there come a great
storm he is the more syker. for he fallyth not in the pytte / Right so
ghostly. he that is drawn out of the pytte of syn^e through refourmyng of faith
/ and when he is out of dedely syn^e he thy^^kyth himself syker enough / And
therefore he woll not profit but hold him still as he is by the pyttis brynke
as nere as he may sothly he is not wise / for at the leest te^ptaco^n of his
enmye or of his flesh he falls in to syn^e again / But never theles if he
flee fro the pytte. that is if he set his heart (...) for to com^ to more
grace. and for to traueyle besily how he (...) come thereto. and give him hertly
to prayeng: thinkyng and other (...) works doing / though great te^ptaco^ns
rise against him (...) fallyth not lightly to dedely syn^e again / And sothly it
is (...) to me ye sythen grace is so good and so profitable why a (...) when
he has but a little thereof / ye so little that he might no less have that
he wolle say hoo / I wolle no more of this / for I have enough / When I see a
worldly man though he have of worldly good much more than him needs / yet he
woll never say hoo / I have enough I woll no more of this / But he woll
coueyte more and more: and traueyle all his wits and his myghtes / And never
woll stynte of his coueytise till he may have no more / Much more then

How that without much bodily and ghostly besines and without much grace and
meekness souls may not be reformed in feeling / ne keep therein after they
come thereto / Caplm xx.
NOw sayste thou. Sith it is so that refourmyng in faith is so low and so
peryllous for to rest in by cawse of dread of falling again / And refourmynge
in feeling is so high and so syker / who so might come thereto. Then
coueyteste thou for to wit what manner traueylle were most spedefull for to
use / by the which a man might prouffyte inn. and come thereto. Or if there
were any certain traueylle or special deed by the which a man might come to
that grace and that refourmynge in feeling / As unto this I say thus / Thou
wotest well that what man or woman woll dispose him for to come to clennesse of
heart and to feeling of grace him behooves have much traueylle and great
fighting in will and in work lastyngly ayenste wicked stirynges of all the
head sins / Not oonly ayenste pride or Envy but against all other with all the
spices that comen out of them / as I have said before in the first writynge.
For why? Passions and flesshly desires let the clennes of the heart and pees
in conscience / And him behooves also for to traueylle for to get all virtues
/ Not oonly chastity and abstynence / but also pacyence and myldenesse /
charytee and meekness and all the other / And this may not be done by one
manner of work / but by diverse works and many after sundry dysposycyons of
men / As now prayenge: now thinking now worchynge some good works / now
assayenge them self in diverse wise / In hunger: in thirst: in cold: in
sufferynge of shame and dyspyte if need be / And in other bodyly disease for
love of virtue and sothfastnesse / This know thou well / for this redest you
in every book y^ techeth of good living / Thus says every man that woll styre
men^es souls to the love of god / And so it semyth that there is no special
traueyle ne certain deed through which only a soul might come to that grace /
but pryncipally through grace of our lord Jesus. and by many deeds and great in
all that he may done. and yet all this is lityll enough / And one skylle may
be this. For sith our lord Ihu^ himself is special master of this craft:
and he is special leche of ghostly syknes: for without him all is nou^te. it
is therefore reasonable that after that he techeth and stireth so a man follow
and work / But he is a simple master that can not teache his discyple while he
is in learning but ever one lesson / and he is an unwise leche that by one
medycyne woll he^e all sores / Therefore our lord Ihu^ that is so wise and so
go^e for to show his wysdom and his goodness he techeth diverse (...) to his
discyples after that they profit in her learning. and yeueth to diverse souls
sere and diverse medycynes after the ^^lynge of her syknes / Also a another
skylle is this: If there (...) any certain deed by the which a soul might
come to the p^^fyte love of god then^e should a man wene that he might come
thereto by his own work and through his own traueyle as a merchant comyth to
his mede by his own traueyle only (...) his own work / Nay it is not so
ghostly in the love of (...) For he that woll serve god wisely and come to
perfyte love (...) god. he shall coueyte to have none other mede but him (...)
But then for to have him may no creature deserve (...) by his own traueyle
/ For though a man might traueyle (...) much bodily and ghostly as all
creatures that ever were might. he mygte not deserve only by his works for
to have god to his mede: for he is souereyn bliss and e^dles godenes. and
passith without comparison al men^es desert^. and therefore he may not begote^
by no man^es special works as bodily mede may / For he is free and yeuyth
himself where he woll. and wha^ he woll. neither for this ne for ye / ne in
this time ne after that time / For though a soul worche all yt he can and may
all his life time / perfyte love of Ihesu shall he never have till our lord
Ihesu woll freely give it / Nevertheless on that other side I say also I hope he
yeuyth it not but if a man worche and traueyle all that he can and may. ye
till him think he may no more / or else be in full will thereto if he might /
And so it semyth yt neither grace only without full worchyng of a soul that
in it is / ne worchynge alone without grace brings a soul to the refourmyng
in feeling / the which refourmyng stondeth in perfect love and charity / But
that one Joined to ye other / that is grace Joined to worchyng brings in to a
soul the blessed feeling of perfyte love / the which grace may not rest fully
but on meke souls that been full of the dread of god / Therefore may I say: he
that has no mekenes ne does his besynes. may not come to this reformyng in
felyng / He has not full mekenes that can not feel of himself sothfastly as he
is / As thus / He that does all the good deeds that he can / as in fasting:
wakyng: weryng of the heir. and all other suffryng of bodyly penance / or
does all the outward works of mercy to his eue^crysten: or else Inward /
as prayenge: weeping: sighyng / and thynkyng if he rest ever in hem and lene
somoche to hem: and rewards hem so greatly in his own syghte yt he presumyth
of his own deserts. and thinks himself ever rich and good holy and
virtuous / sothly aslong as he felyth thus he is not meke enough / Ne though he
say or think that all that he does is of goddis yeft and not of himself. he
is not yet meke enough for he may not make himself yet naked of all his good
deeds / ne make him poor sothfastly in spirit / ne feel himself naught as he
is / And sothly until a soul can feel ably thorugh grace naught himself. and
baren him from all the good deeds that he does thorugh beholdynge of
sothefastnes of Ihesu he is not perfytly meke / For what is meekness but so
the fastness? Soothly naught else / And therefore he that thorugh grace may
see Ihesu how that he does all / And himself does right naught but suffers
Ih^u worche in him what him likyth. he is meke / But this is full hard. and as
it were Impossyble. and unreasonable to a man that worcheth all by man^es
reason / and sees no ferder for to do many good deeds / and then for to
arrette all to Ihu^. and set himself at naught / Nevertheless who so might
have a ghostly syghte of sothfastnes him should think it full true and full
reasonable for to do so / And sothly he that has this syghte shall never do
the less / but he shall be styred for to traueyle bodily and ghostly much the
more and with the better will / And this may be one cause why some men
peraue^ture swynke and sweet and pyne her wretched body with outragyous
penance all her life time / and are ever saye^g orysons and sawters and many
other deeds / and yet may they not come to the ghostly feeling of the love of
god as it semyth that some done in short time with less pain. for they have
not that mekenes that I spoke of Also on that other side I say he that does
not his business that thinks thus. whereto should I traueyle / whereto should
I pray or think wake or fast / or any other bodily penance do for to come
to such grace sythen it may not be gotten (...) had but only of the free yefte
of Ih^u / Therefore I woll aby^^ in flesshlines as I am. and right naught do of
such works* bodily ne ghostly until he give it / For if he woll give it he
askyth no worchyng of me what so that I do. and how lityll that I do I shall
have it / And if he woll not give it. traueyl^ I never so fast therefore I get
it never the sooner / He that says thus may not come to this refourmyng. for
he drawyth hi^ self wylfully to ydlenes of flessheed: and vnableth him to the
yefte of grace in asmoche as he puts fro him both Inward werkyng yt
sto^dith in lasting desire and in lo^gyng to Ihu^ and outward werkyng by
traueyle of his body in outward deeds. so may he not have it / therefore I say
he yt has no true mekenes ne full hertly besynes other inward only by great
fervor and lastyng desire. and besy prayer and thought in god. or else both
Inward and outward. may he not come to this ghostly refourmynge of his image
/

An entree how a soul shall have her in menynge and worchinge that woll come
to this refourmyng by ensample of a pilgryme going to Iherlm. And of two manner
of mekenes Caplm xxi.
Nevertheless for thou coueytest for to have some manner worchyng by the which
thou might the rather nyghe^ to that refourmyng / I shall say as me thinks
by the grace of our lord Ihesu the shortest and the redyest help that I know
in this werchyng / And how that shall be I shall tell yt by an ensample of a
good pilgrim upon this wise / There was a man that would goo to Ihrlm. And for
he knew not the way he came to a another man that he hoped knew the way
better thither. and asked wheder he might come to that cite / that other man
said to him that he might not come thyd without great disease and much
traueylle / For the way is long and peryllous and full of great thieves and
robbers / and many other lettynges there ben that fallen to a man in the going
/ And also there are many sere ways as it semyth ledyng thydwarde / But men
aldaye are slain and dispoylled and may not come to that place that they
coueyten / Nevertheless there is one way the which who so takes it and
holds it he wolle undertake that he should come to that cytee of Jerusalem.
and he should never lose his lyffe. ne be slain ne deye for defawte He should
often be robbed and evil beat and suffer much disese in the gooynge. but his
life should be saaf / Then^e said the pilgrim / So that I may have my life
saaf and come to that place that I coueyte to. I charge not what myscheyff I
suffer in going / And therefore say me what thou wolt and sothly I behote the
for to do after the. That other man answers and says thus / Lo I set the
in the right way / This is ye way And that thou keep the learning that I teache
the / what so you herest see or felyst that should let the in the way
abide not with it wyllfully / tare not for it restfully. behold it not: like
it not: dread it not / but ever goo forth in thy way. and think yt thou
would be at Ihrlm / for that thou coueytest. and that thou desyrest. and
naught else but that. And if men rob the and dispoyll the: beat the: scorn
the: despise the / strive not again if thou wolte have thy life / but hold the
with the harm that you have* and goo forth as naught were. that thou take no
more harm And also if men woll tarry the with tales. and feed the with
lesynges for to draw yt to myrthes: and for to leave thy pilgrimage: make a
deef ere and answer not again / and say naught else but that thou would be
at Ihrlm / And if men profer the yeftes and wol make the rich with wordly good
tente not to he^ think ever on Ihrlm / And if thou woll hold this way and do
that I have said. I undertake thy life yt thou shall not be slain. but thou
shall come to that place that thou coueytest to / Ghostly to our purpoos: Ihrlm
is asmoche for to say. as a sight of peace / and betokens conte^placo^n in
perfyte love of god / For conte^placo^n is nout else but a syghte of god
which is very pees / Then if thou coueyte for to come to this blyssed sight
of very pees. and be a true pilgryme to Ihrlm (...)^ though it be so that I
were never there: nevertheless as (...) forth as I can I shall set the in the
way thydwarde / The begyn^yng of the high way in the which thou shall goo /
is ^^fourmyng in faith grounded mekely in the faith and in the (...) of holy
church as I have said before / For trust sykerly though you have syn^ed here
before^ if thou be now reformed by the sacrament of penance after the law of
holy church that you art in the right way / Now then^e sithe^ you art in the
syker way if thou woll speed in thy going and make good Iournayes* yt behooves
to hold thise ii. things often in thy mind. meekness and love: and yt is: I
am naught I have nout. I coueyte naught but one / Thou shalt have the meaning
of thise words in thyn intent and in habytt of thy soul lastyngly though thou
hauue hem not ever specially in thy thought. for ye needs not / Mekenes
sayth^ I am naught / I have naught / Love says I coueyte noute but one: and
that is Ihu^ / Thise two stre^ges well festned with the mind of Ihu^ makyth
good a cord in ye harp of the soul when they ben craftly towched with the
finger of reason / For the lower thou smytes upon that one the hyer sowneth
that other / The less thou felyst that thou art or that thou haste of thyself
through mekenes / the more thou coueytest for to have of Ihu^ in desire of love
/ I mean not only of that mekenes that a soul felith in the syghte of his
own syn^e for freelnes and wretchidnes of this life or of the wretchidnes of
his euencrysten / For though this mekenes be soth fast and medicynable.
nevertheless it is boystous and flesshly as in regard not clean ne soft ne
lovely / But I mean also this mekenes that the soul felyth through grace in
syghte and beholdynge of the endless being and the wonderful goodness of Ihu^
And if thou may not see it yet with thy ghostly eye. that thou trow it / For
through syghte of his being either in full faith or in felyng thou shall hold
thyself not only the most wretch that is. but also as naught in substance
of thy soul though thou had never done sin^e. And that is lovely mekenes
For in reward of Ihesu that is sothfastly all: thou art right naught / And
also that thou think that thou have right naught: but art as a vessel that
stondeth ever to me as naught were therein as of thyself / For do thou never so
many good deeds outward or inward till you have and feel that you have ye love
of Jesus: you have rit naught / for with ye precious licour only may thy soul
be fulfilled and with none other / and for asmoche as ye thing alone is so
precious and worthy therefore what you have or what you do hold it as nout for
to rest in without ye site of ye love of Ihu^. Cast it all behind the and
forgete it that thou myt have that. that is the best of all / Right as a true
pilgryme going to Ihrlm leueth behind him house and land. wife and child /
and makyth himself poor and bare fro all thing that he has that he might
goo lightly without lettyng / right so if thou wolt be a ghostly pilgryme thou
shall make thyselfe naked fro all that thou have. that are both good deeds and
badde and cast hem all behind the that thou be so poor in thine own felyng
/ that there be no thing of thyn own worchynge that thou wolt lene upon
restyngly / but ever desiryng more grace and love / and ever seeking the
ghostly presence of Ihu^ / And if thou do thus then shall thou set in thin
heart fully that thou would be at Ihrlm and at none other place but there /
And that is. thou shall set in thyn heart holy and fully that thou would
no thing have but the love of Ihu^ and the ghostly syghte of him as he woll
show him / for to that only (...) thou made and bought / and that is thy
begyn^yng and thyn endyng thy Joy and thy bliss / And therefore what so ever
that thou have. be thou never so rich in other deeds bodily or ghostly but if
you have that and know and feel that thou have it. hold that thou have right
naught / Prynte well this reason in thy meaning of thy heart. and cleue sadly
thereto. and it shall save the fro all ^^rylles in thy gooynge. that thou shall
never perysshe. and it (...) save the fro the thieves and robbers ye which I
call unclean ^^^rytes. that though they spoil the and beat the through diverse
(...) thy life shall ever be saaf / And shortly if thou keep (...) as I shall
say the you shall escape al perils and myscheues. and (...) to the cite of
Irhlm within short time / Now thou art in ye way and know what the place
hyghte and whyd thou shall draw to / Begyn^e then^e for to goo in thy Journey
/ Thy forth going is naught else but ghostly worchynge and bodily also when
need is. which thou shall use by discreco^n upon this wise / what work yt it
be that you shall do after the degree and the state yt thou stondist in bodily
or ghostly if it help this gracyous desire that thou have for to love Ihesu:
and make it more hole: more easy and more mighty to all virtues. and to all
goodness. that work hold I best: be it prechynge. be it thinking / be it
redynge: be it worchyng / And aslonge as that work stre^gthyth most thy heart
and thy will to ye love of Ihu^. and ferdest drawyth thyn affecco^n and thy
thought fro worldly vanytee it is good for to use it / And if it be so that
through use savor of that lesseth^ and the thinks an other work sauoureth ye
more. and thou felyst more grace in a another / take a another and leave that /
For though thy desire and the yernyng of thyn heart to Ihesu should be ever
vnchau^gable: nevertheless thy ghostly works that thou shall use in prayenge or
thinking for to feed and nouryssh^ thy desire may be dyuers^ and may well be
changed after that thou felyste the dysposed through grace in applyeng of thyn
own heart / ^or it fares by works and by desire as it does by styckes and by
a fire / For the more styckes are laid to ye fire: the gretter is the fire /
Right so the more diverse ghostly workynge that a man has in his thought for
to keep hole his desire: ye mytyer and more bren^yng shall his desire be to god
And therefore look wisely what work thou canste best do. and that most
helpyth for to save hole this desire to Ihu^ if thou be free and art not bound
but vnd the common law. and that do / Bind the not to wylfull customs
vnchaungably that should let the fredom of thine heart for to love Ihu^ if
grace would visyte the specially / For I shall tell the which customs are
ever good and nedeful to be kept / Loo such custom is ever good to hold yt
sto^deth in getyng of virtue and lettyng of syn^e. and that custom should
never be left / for you shall ever be meke: pacye^t^ sobre and chaste if thou well
do. and so of al other vtues But the custom of a another thing that lettyth a
better is good for to leave when time is there a man may / As thus If a man
have in custom for to say thus many beedes / or for to think this manner of
thoute thus long time / or for to wake or knele thus long or any other such
bodily deed. this custom is for to leave sometime wha^ reasonable cause lettith.
or else if more grace comyth otherwise /

whereto shall thou coueyte that thou may not hauene art not worthy thereto.
Trow hem not but goo forth and say thus / Not for I am worthy but for I am
vnworthy^ therefore would I love god / For if I had it. that should make me
worthy / And sythen I was made thereto though I should never have it yet woll I
coueyte it / and therefore woll I pray and think that I might get it / And
then if thine enmyes see that thou begynnest to wax bold and well wylled to
thy work. they begin to wexe aferde of the / Nevertheless they woll not cease
of taryenge the when they may as long as thou art gooynge in the way /
what with dread and manassynge on that one side. what with flaterynge and falls
pleysynge on that other side for to make the break thy purpose and turn home
again they woll say thus. If thou hold forth thy desire to Ihesu so fully
trauelynge as thou begynnest. thou shall fall in to syckenes or in to
fantasyes or in to frenesyes as thou see that some done Or thou shall fall
in to pouertee and bodily myscheyf. and no man shall well help the / Or thou
might fall in to prive temptaco^ns of the fend that thou shall not help
thyselfe For it is wonder peryllous to any man for to give him fully to the
love of god and leave all the world. and no thing coueyte but oonly the love
of hym^ for so many perils may fall that a man knows not of / And therefore
torn home again and leave this desire / for thou shall never bring it to the
end / and do as other worldly men done.

Thus sayen thyn enmyes. but trow hem not / but hold for the thy desire / and
say not else but thou would have Ihesu and be at Ihrlm / And if they
perceive then thy will so strong that thou wolt not spare for syn^e ne for
syknesse. for fantasyes ne for frenesyes / for dowtes ne for dredes of ghostly
te^ptaco^ns / for myscheyf ne for pouerte / for life ne for death. but ever
forth thou wolt with one thing? and no thing but one. and make deef ere to
hem as though you herd hem not. and holdeste ye forth styfly in thy prayer and
in thine other ghostly works without stintyng with discreco^n after counsel
of thy souereyn or of thy ghostly fader / then begin they for to be wroth
and to goo a little nerer the. Then^e they begin for to rob the and beat the
and do the all the shame that they can / And that is when they make that all
the deeds that thou do ben they never so well done are denied of other men
as evil: and turned in to the wors party / And what so ever it be that thou
would have done in help of thy body or of thy soul it shall be let or
hyndred by other men. so that thou shall be put fro thy will in all thing that
thou skilfully coueytes. And all this they done that you sholdest be styred to

IF thou wolt wit then^e what this desire is (...) Ihu^ / for he makith this

naught but suffrest him worche in thy soul / and assentyst to him with great
gladness of heart that he wouche sauf for to ^oo so in the / Thou art
naught else but a reasonable Instrument wherein yt he worcheth / And therefore
when you felyst thy thoute by towchi^ge of his grace take up with desire to Ihu^
with a mighty devout will for to plese him and love him. then^ think that thou
have Ihesu. for he it is that thou desire Behold him well for he gooth
before the: not in bodily lyknes but vnsenseably by pryue presence of his

Thus prayed the prophet to ye fader of heaven saying thus: Emitte luce^ tua^
and veritate^ tua^. ip^a me dedux eru^t et adduxeru^t in monte^ scm^ tuu^ and
in tab^nacula tua: P. xlii.
That is / Fader of heaven send out thy light and thy sothfastnesse. yt is thy
sone Ihu^ / and he shall led me by desire in me to ye holy hylle and in to thy
tabernacles. that is to the felyng of perfyte love and heyghte in conte^placo^n
/ Of this desire spekyth the prophet thus. Memoriale tuu^ in desiderio ai^e
me. Ai^a mea desiderauit te in nocte: ^
sed and sp^us meus in p^cordiis meis. That is: For de Ihu^ the mind of the is
prynted in desire of my soul / for my soul has desired the in the night.
and my spirit has coueyted the in all thynkynges / And why the prophet says
he has desired god all in the night as a tymefull space bytwix days two /
For wha^ one day is ended a another comith not anon / but first comyth night
and departs the days sometime long and sometime short / and then^e after
comyth a another day / The prophet meaned not only of this manner of night:
but he meaned a ghostly night / Thou shall vndsto^de that there ben two days
or two lyghtes / The first is a falls lygte. the second is a true light / The false light is the love of this world that a man has in himself of corrupco^n
of his flesh / The true light is the perfyte love of Ihesu felyd thorugh
grace in a man^es soul. The love of this world is a false light / For it
passes away and lasts not / and so it perfourmeth not that ye it behoteth
/ This light behighte the fe^de to Adam when he stired him to sin and said
thus / Aperientur oculi vestri et eritis sicut dii / Gen^. 3.
That is / your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as goddis / And he said
sothe there. For when Adam had sinned anon his Inner eye was sperred and
ghostly light wythdrawe. and his utter eyes were opened / and he felt and saw
a new light of flesshly likyng and worldly love that he saw not before / And
so saw he a new day but this was an evil day / For this was it that Job
waryed when he said thus / Pereat dies in qua natus su^ / That is: Job 3.
Peryssh^ the day in the which I was borne / He waryed not the day rennynge
in the year that god made / but he waryed this day that man made. that is the
co^cupiscens and the love of this world in the which he was borne though he
felyd it not^ Then^e this day and this light he asked of god that it should
perissh^ and no longer last / But the everlasting love of Ihu^ is a true
day and a blessed light / For god is both love and light. and he is
everlasting as saint Ioh^n says / Qui diligit deu^ manet in lumine / That is:
He that loves god dwellyth in the light Than what man perceyueth and sees the
love of this world falls and faylinge. and for that he woll forsake it and seek
the love of Ihu^ / He may not as soon feel the love of him. but he must abide
awhyle in the night / for he may not suddenly come fro that one light to that
other / that is fro the love of the worl^^ to perfyte love of god / This night
is naught else but a forberynge and a wythdrawyng of the thought and of the
soul fro erthly things by great desire and yernyng for to love and see and
feel Ihu^ and ghostly things / This is the night / For right as the night
is derke and ever hydynge from all bodily creature: and a restynges of all
bodily deeds /

Right so a man that settyth him fully for to think on Jesus / and for to
desire only the love of him is besye for to hide his thought fro vain
beholdynge and perceiving. and his affection fro flesshly liking and loving
of all bodily creatures / So that his thought may be made free and not
subgett. ne his affection bound ne pyned ne troubled in no thing lower or
woors than himself / And if he may do so then^e it is night with him: for
then^e he is in derknesse / But this is a good night and a light derknesse /
for it is a stoppynge out of the false love of this world. and it is a nyghing
of the true day / And soothly the derker that this night is the nerer is the
true day of the love of Ihu^ / For the more that ye soul may through longyng
to god be hid fro noise and dyn^e of flesshli affecco^ns and unclean
thoughts the nerer is it for to feel the light of the love of him for it is
even at it / Thus semyth it the prophet meaned when he said thus / Cum in te
nebris sedeo dn^s lux mea est. That is: when I sit in derknes our lord is my
light / That is: when my soul is hid fro all stirynges of sin as it were
in sleep: then^e is our lord my light. for then nygheth he of his grace for
to show me of his light / Nevertheless this night is sometime paynfull /
first when a man is much foul and is not through grace used to be often in
this derknes but would feign have it. and therefore he settyth his thought and
his desire to godwarde asmoche as he may / he would not feel ne think but
only of him. and by cause that he may not lightly have it therefore it is
paynfull / For the custom and the homelynes that he has had with sins
before of the world and of flesshly affecco^ns and erthly things. and his
flesshly deeds prees so upon him and ever smite in by maystry and draw down
all ye soul so hem that he may not well be hid fro hem as soon as he would /
Therefore this derkenes is paynfull to him / and namly wha^ grace towchith not
habu^dantly / Nevertheless if it be so with the. be not to heavy ne strive not
much as though thou would through maystry put hem out of thy thought / for
thou may. not do so but abide grace: suffer easily. and break not thyself
tomoche And slyely if thou may draw thy desire and thy ghostly beholding to
Ihu^: as if thou would not charge hem. For wete thou well when thou would
desire Ihesu and oonly think on him. and thou may not freely for precyng in of
such worldly thoughts: sothly thou art outward of the false day. and thou art
entryng in to this derkenes / But thy derkenes is not restfull by cause of
disease and vncu^nynge and vnclen^es of thy self / And therefore use it often and
it shall by process through feeling of grace be more easy and more restful to
the / And that is when thy soul through grace is made so free and so mighty
and so good and so gadred in to itself that it list not to think on right
naught / Then^e is it in a good derknesse / This naught I mean thus. that a
soul may through grace be gadred into itself freely and holy: and not be
driven against the will ne drawn down by maystry for to think or like or love
with cleuynge of affecco^n to any syn^e or vaynly any erthly thing then
thinks the soul naught / For then^e thynkith it of none erthly thing
cleuyngly / This is a rich naught / And this naught and this night is a great
ease for the soul that desires the love of Ihesu / It is in ease as for
thought of any e^^dely thing / nevertheless it is full besy for to think on
him / What thing then^e makyth this derkenes? Sothly naught else but a
gracyous desire for to have the love of Ihu^ / For yt desire and that longyng
that it has that time to ye love of god ^or to see him and have him dryueth
out of the heart all worldly vanytees and flesshly affecco^ns. and gadreth the
soul in to itself. and occupyeth it oonly for to think how it might come to
the love of him / And that time may it freely and deuo^tly behold Ihu^ whed
it woll pray or think. and so it bryngith it to this rygh^t naught. and
sothly it is not al derke ne nout wha^ it thinkyth thus For though it be derke
fro falls light it is not al derke fro ye true light. for ihu^ yt is both love
and lyte is in this derknes whed it be paynful or restfull / If it be paynful
then^e he is in ye soul as traueylyng in desire and lo^gynge to light. but he
is not yet as resting in love ne as showing his light / And therefore it is
called night and derknesse in asmoche as the soul is hid fro the false
light of the world. and has not yet fully feeling of true light: but is in
abidyng of that blessed love of god which it desires / Then^e if thou wolte
wit when thou art in this syker derkenesse and when not / you may assay thus
and seek no ferder but thus / When thou felyst thyn entente and thy will fully
set for to desire god. and think only ^n him / thou may as it were first
ask thyselfe in thyn own thought whether thou coueyte for to have any thing
of this life for love of itself / or for to have the use of any of thy bodily
wits in any creature / And then if thyn eye answer the thus / I would see
right naught / and thy mouth. I would savor right naught / and after thyn
eere. I would here right naught / and thy body. I would feel right nout / And
after if thine heart say. I would think right naught of erthly thing ne of
bodily deed / ne I would have affecco^n fastened flesshly to no creature but
oonly in god / and to godwarde if that I cowde / And when they answer all thus
to the and that is done full redily if grace towche the. then^e art thou entered
somewhat into this derkues / For though thou feel and perceive gle^tynges and
proferynges of vain thoughts and precynge in of flesshly affeccions.
nevertheless thou art in this profitable derknes if it be so that thyn
thought be not fyxed in hem / For such vayn ymagynaco^ns that fall in the
heart vnauisedly trowble^ this derknes / and pyneth the soul somewhat by cause
that it would be hid fro hem and may not / but they do not away y^ profit
of this derknes / for the soul shall by that way come to restfull myrknes /
And then^e is this derknes restful when the soul is hid for a time fro the
paynfull felyng of all such vayn thoughts. and only is rested in desire and
lo^gynge to Ihu^ with a ghostly beholdynge of him as it shall be said
afterward / But that lasts but a while hoole / Nevertheless though it be
but a short time it is full profitable /

How that the desire of Ihesu felt in this lyghtsom derknes sleeth al stirynges
of syn^e. and ableth the soul to perceive ghostly lyghtnynges fro the heavenly
Iherusalem that is Ihesu / Caplm xxv.
THen^e sithen this derknesse and this night is so good and so restfull
though it be short that stondeth only in desire and longyng to the love of
Ihu^ with a blind thynkyng on him how good then^e and how blessid is it for to
feel his love. and for to be illumyned with his blessid vnseable present light
for to see sothfastnes / the which light a soul receives wha^ the night
passith and the day spryngeth / This I hope was the nyighte that the prophet
meaned when he said: My soul has desired the in y^ night / As I have before
said. it is much better to be hid in this derke night fro beholding of the
world though it were paynful: than for to be out in falls lykyng of this
world yt semyth so shinyng and so comfortable to hem that are blind in
knowing of ghostly light / For when you art in this derknes thou art much
nerer Ihrlm than when thou art in the mids of the false light / Therefore
apply thine heart fully to the stiryng of grace and use for to won in this
derknes. and by often assayeng to be homly therein and it shall be so ^^e made
restfull to the / And the true light of ghostly knowing shall spring to the.
not all at ones: but pryuely by lityll and by lityll / as the prophet says:
Habita^tibus in regione vmbre mortis. lux orta est eis / That is: To dwelling
in the country of shadow of death light was sprongen / That is: Light of
grace sprongen and shall spring to all them that can won in the shadow of
death / that is in this derkenesse that is like to death /

For as death sleeth a living body and all flesshly felinges of it right so
desire to the love of Ihu^ felyd in this derkes sleeth al sins: all flesshly
affecco^ns. and all unclean thoughts for the time / And then nyghest thou
fast to Ihrlm / Thou art not there yet. but by small sodein lyghtynges that
glidyrth out of small caves fro that cytee shall thou mow see it fro far or
that thou come thereto / For wit thou well though yt thy soul be in this
restfull derknesse without troublynge of worldly vanytees / it is not yet
clothed all in light: ne turned all in to fire of love / But it felyth well
that there is so^what above itself that it knowith not ne has not yet. but
would have it and bren^yngly yerneth it / And that is naught else but ye
syighte of Ihrlm without forth. the which is like to a cytee / yt the prophet
Ezechyell saw in his visyons / He says that he saw a cite set upon an
hylle heldinge to the southe that to his syghte when it was moten was no more of
length and of bread than a reed that is vi. cubytes and a palm of length But
as soon as he was brought in to the cite and lokyd about him then^e thought
him that it was wonder much / For he saw many halles and chambres both open
and pryuee. He saw gates and porches outward and Inward / and much more
byldynge tha^ I say now on length and on bread many hundred cubits / Then
was this wonder to him how this cite within was thus long and so large that so
lityll to his sight was when he was without / This cite betokens the perfect
love of god set in the hylle of conte^placo^n. the which unto the syghte of a
soul that without the feeling of it traueyleth in the desire toward semyth
somewhat / but it semyth but a lityll thing no more than a reed that is vi.
cubytes and a palm of length / By vi. cubits are vndstonde the perfecco^n of
man^es work / And by the palm a lityll to wchynge of conte^placo^n / He sees
well that there is such a thing that passes the deserte of all the worchynge
of man a lityll as the palm passes the vi. cubytes / but he sees not within
what it is / nevertheless if he may come within the cite of conte^placo^n /
then sees he much more than he saw first /

How a man shall know falls Illumynaco^ns feyned by ye fend fro the true light
of knowing that comyth out of Ihu^ and by what tokens / Caplm xxvi.
But now bewaar of the mydday fend that feyneth light as it came out of Ihrlm
and is not so. For the tend sees that our lord Ihu^ shewyth light to his
lovers of so the fastnes / therefore in deceyuyng of hem that are unwise he
shewyth a light that is not true under color of a true light and deceyueth
hem. Nevertheless how a soul may know the light of sothfastnes when it
shyneth from god and when it is feyned through the enmye shall I say as me
thinks by an example of the fyrmament / Sometime the fyrmamente shewyth a
light fro the son^e / and semyth the son and is not And sometime shewyth the
true son^e truly. A knowing of that one from that other is this / The feyned
son shewyth him not but bitwix two black reyny clouds / Then^e by cause ye
son is nere there shyneth out fro the clouds a light as it were a son^e and
is none / But the true son^e shewith him when the fyrmament is clear or much
clered fro the black clouds / Now to our purpose / Some men as it semith
forsakes the love of the world and would come to the love of god and (...) the
light of vndstondynge of him. but they woll not com^ through this derknes that
I have spoken of before / They woll know hemselfe truly ne mekely what they
have been (...) ne what they are yet through syn^e / ne how naught they are
(...) her own kind ayenste god / They are not besy for to entree in to
hemself all other things outward left. and flee al wicked stirynges ye risen
in her hertes of pride envy ire or other sins through lasting desire to Ihu^
in prayenge and in thinking: in scylence and in weeping / and in other bodily
and ghostly exercise as devout men and holy men have done / But as soon as they
have forsake the world as it were outward in lyknesse or else soon after
they wene that they are holy and able for to have the ghostly understanding of
the gospel and of holy writ / and namly if they may fulfill letterly the
commandments of god and keep hem fro bodily sins that they wene yt they
love god perfytly / And therefore they woll anon preche and teache all other men
as if they had received grace of vndstondynge in perfecco^n of charity through
special yeft of the holy ghost / And also they are much more styred for as
much as they feel sometime much knowing as it were suddenly yeuen to hem
without great study before had. and also much fervor of love as it semyth
for to preche troth and rightwisnes to her euencrysten / Therefore they hold
it as a grace of god yt vysiteth hem with his blessid light before other
souls / Nevertheless if they woll look well about he^ they shall find that this
light of knowing and that hete that they feel comyth not of the true sone
that is our lord Ihu^. but it comith fro ye myddaye fend that feyneth light
and lykneth him to the son^e And therefore shall he be known by example before
said / Liyghte of cu^nynge that is feyned by the fend to a derke soul is
showed bitwix two black reyny clouds / The over cloud is presu^pcyon and
higheng of hemself / The nether cloud is down puttyng and a lowenge of his
euencristen / Then^e what light of knowing or felyng of fervor that it be yt
shyneth to a soul with presu^pcion and highenge of it self and disdeyne of his
eue^crysteu the same time felyd it is not light of grace yeuen of the holy
ghost though the knowing in itself were so thefast. but it is either of the
fend if it come suddenly or else of man's own wit if it come by studye^
And so it may well be known. yt this feyned light of knowing is not the
light of the true son / Therefore they that have this knowing on this manner
are full of ghostly pride and seen it not. they are so blind with this feyned
lite yt they hold the hines of her own^ heart and thu^buxo^nes to ye laws of
holy church as it were perfect mekenes to ye gospel and to ye laws of god /
and they wene that the following of her own will were freedom of spirit / and
therefore they begin to reyne as black clouds water of errors and heresies:
for the words that they shewe^ by prechynge sownen all to bacbitynge and to
stryuynge and to discord / making repreuynge of states and of persons / and
yet sayen they that all this is charity and zele of ryghtwysnes / But it is not
so the. for saint James thapostle says thus / Vbi enim zelus and co^tencio ibi
inconstancia and om^e opus prauu^ / Non est sapiencia hec desursu^ desce^dens a
patre luminu^. sed est trena ai^alis and diabolica / That is: where so envy
is and flitynge there is vnstablynes and all evil work / And therefore that
cu^nynge that brings forth such sins comyth not from the fader of light
that is god / but it is erthly beestly and fendly / And so by thise tokens that
are pride presu^pcyon vnbuxomnes Indignaco^n (...) bitynge and other such
sins for thise folowen after. may the feyned light be known fro the true /
For the true son shines and shows him not by special vysitaco^n for to
give light of understanding or perfyte charity to a soul but the fyrmament be
first made bryghte and clear fro clouds / that is* but if the conscience be
made clean through fire of brennyng desire to Ihesu in this derkenes the which
wastes and bren^eth all wicked stirynges of pride. vaynglory: ire envy: and
al other (...) in the soul as the prophet says / Ignis ante ip^m (...) et
infla^mabit incircuitu inimicos eius. Fire shall goo (...) him: That is desire
of love shall goo byfor^ Ihesu in (...) soul / and it shall bren^e all his
enmyes / that is: it shall waste all synes / For but if a soul be first smyten
down fro the heighte of itself by dread and mekenes. and be well examyned and
burnt in this fire of desire / and as it were purifyed fro all ghostly fylthe
by long time in devout prayers and other ghostly exercyses it is not able to
suffer the shinynges of ghostly light / ne for to receive the precious lycour
of perfyte love of Jesus / But when it is purifyed and made subtle thorugh this
fire then may it receive the gracyous light of ghostly knowing and the
perfeccyon of love that is true son / Thus says holy writ: Mal^ iiii
Vobis qui timetis deu^ vrietur sol iusticie / The true son of rightwysnes
that is our lord Ihesu shall spring to you that dreden him / that is to meke
souls that meken hemself under her euencrysten by knowing of her own
wretchydnesse / and casten hemself down under god by noughtynge of hemself in
her own substance thorugh reuerente dread and ghostly beholdynge of him
lastyngly / for that is perfyte mekenes / Unto thise souls the true son^e
shall spring. and Illumyn her reason in knowing of sothfastnes / and kyndleth
her affecco^n in brennynge of love and then shall they both brenne and shine
/ They shall thorugh virtue of this heavenly son brenne in perfyte love: and
shine in knowing of god and ghostly things / for then they ben reformed in
felyng / Therefore he that woll not be deceived I hope it is good to him to
draw down himself and hyde him in this derkenes / First from entermetynge
of other men as I have said / and forgete all the world if he may and follow
Ihesu with lasting desire offered in prayers and thinking on him / Then I
trow the light that comith after this derkenes is syker and sothfaste / and
that it shyneth of the cite of Ihrlm from the true son to a soul that
traueleth in derknes / and cries after light for to wyssyn it the waey. and
comfort it in traueyle. For I hope after true derkenes before comyth never
feyned light*

That is if a man truly and fully set him to forsake the love of the world
/ And may thorugh grace come to felyng and knowing of himself / And hold
him mekely in that feeling / he shall not be dysceyued with none errors ne
heresies / ne with fantasyes / For all these comen by the gate of pride /
Then if that pride may be stopped out / then there shall no such sin
rest in a soul / And though that they come and profer hem they shall not enter
/ For grace that the soul felyth in this meke derkenes shall teache the soul
sothe fastnes. and show to it yt al such proferynges are of the^mye /

How great profit is it to the soul to be brought through grace in to
lyhtsome derkenes / And how a man shall dispose him if he woll come thereto /
Caplm xxvii.
THere are many devout souls that through grace come in to this derkenes and
felen the knowing of hemself^ and yet wot they not fully what it is / and that
unknowing in party hyndreth hem / They feel well often her thought and her
affecco^n drawn out and departed fro the mind of erthly things and brought
in to great rest of a delectable softnes with out pinfull trowblynge of vain
thoughts or of her (...) wits / and they feel that time so great freedom of
spirit ^ they may think on Ihesu peasible / and offer her psalms ^ prayers
myghtily sauourly and swetly to him as long as (...) of bodily kind may
suffer it / They wot well that th^^ feeling is good / but they noot what it is
/ Therefore unto (...) such souls I say as me thinks: that this manner of
(...) though it be but short and but seldom it is sothfastly (...) derkenesse
that I speak of / For it is a feeling of hemself (...) and a rysynge above
hemself through bren^ynge desire to the ^^yghte of Ihu^ / Or else if I shall
say more sothly. this gri^^ous feeling is a ghostly syghte of Ihu^ / And if
they may keep hem in that rest or bring it through grace in to a custom so
that they might lightly and freely have it when hem like and hold hem in it /
they should never be overcome by te^ptacion of the fend ne of the flesh / ne
by errors ne heresies: for they are set in the gate of contemplacyon able
and ready for to receive the perfyte love of Ihesu / Therefore he that has it it
is good that he know it mekely / ^repe it tenderly / and poursew it fervently
that no crature let him utterly from it that he ne follow it when he may /
And that he forgete and set at naught all thing that should put him fro
this if he be free of himself / and may do what he woll without sclaunder or
disease of his euencrysten / For me thynkith that he may not come to this rest
lightly but if he have great ple^te of grace / and set himself for to follow
after the stirynge of grace / And that owes he for to do / For grace woll
ever be free / namely fro sin and worldly besynes. and from all other things
that letten the worchyng of it though they are no sin / Nevertheless a another
soul that has not yet received this fullness of grace if he desire for to
come to this gostly knowing of Ihesu / as much as in him is he must able
himself to it / and putt away all lettynges that stoppen grace as much as he
may / He must learn for to deye to ye world and forsake the love of it
truly / First pride bodily and ghostly / that he desire no worship / worldly
cu^nynge. ne worldly craft / benefyces ne richesse / precious clothing: ne
worldly array / ne no thing where through he should be worshypped above other
men / He shall coueyte none of all these / But if they ben putt upon him. take
hem with dread so that he be poor both outward and Inward / or else fully
Inward in heart / And that he coueyte for to be forgeten of the world that
men reward him no more be he never so rich ne so cunning than the poorest
man that lives /

Also that he suffers not his heart rest in beholding of his own deeds or in
his virtues / wenynge that he does better than a another / for he forsakyth the
world and other done not so / and therefore sets well by himself / Also he
must leave all rysyng of heart and evil will of ire and envy against his
euencristen / And that he disease no man ne anger him vnskylfully in word ne
in deed / ne give any man matere where thorugh he might skylfully be angered or
styred / so that he might be free fro every man / And also that he forsake
couetyse that he coueyte right naught of erthly good / but only ask his
bodily sustenaunce that him needs and hold him paid when god styreth other
men for to give him / And that he put no manner of trust in hauour of any
worldly good / ne in help or favor of any worldly friend but pryncypally and
fully in god / For if he do otherwise he byndeth himself to the world / And
he may not therefore be free for to think on Ihesu / And also glotenye and
lecherye and al other flesshly uncleanness utterly he must leave. that the
affecco^n be bound to no woman by flesshly homelynesse / For it is no dowte
that such blind love that is sometime atwyxe a man and a woman / and semyth
good and honest for asmoche as they would not sin in deed / in the syghte of
god is full unclean and well great sin / For it is a great sin that a man
shall suffer his affection that should be festened to Ihesu and to al virtues
and to al ghostly clennes for to be bound wi^h any flesshly love of any
creature wylfully namly if it (...) so much that it bears down the
thought: and makyth (...) vnrestful that he may no savor have in god / Thus
(...) it wylfully that a man does it and says it is sin (...) is so blinded
with it that he woll not see it / And also (...) a man coueyte not delices of
metes and drynkes only (...) of his flesh / but hold him paid with such
(...) may easily have without great besynes namly if (...) what mete it be
that woll do away hu^gre / and keep the (...) in common strength unto the
seruyse of god / And (...) grutche not ne strive not ne anger him not for his
mete th^ugh he be sometime not served as the flesh would / All these sins
and all other must be forsake utterly in his will and in deed when he may. And
other things that lets him so that he may dyspose him for to think freely
on Ihesu / For as long as these lettynges and such other hang upon him he
may not deye to the world: ne come in to this derkenesse of knowing of
himself / And therefore that he might come thereto he must do all these. as
saint poul did saying thus / Michi mu^dus crucifixus est and ego mu^do / This
world is slain and crucyfied to me: Gal. v:
and I to the world / That is: He yt has forsake the love of the world in
worshippes and riches in all other worldly things before said for the love of
god. and loves not it ne pursewyth not it but is well paid that he has right
naught of it ne would have though he might. sothly to him the world is deed /
for he has no savor ne delight therein / Also if the world set him at
naught and has no reward to him. ne favor ne worship: ne set no price by
him but forgeteth him as a deed man / then is he deed to the world / And in
this plyght was saint poul set perfitly. and so must a another man in party
that would follow and come to the perfect love of god / For he may not live to
god fully but if he deye first to the world / This deyenge to the world is
this derkenes / and it is the gate of contemplaco^n and to refourmyng in
felyng. and none other than this There may be many sundry ways and seere
works lettinge and ledyng sundry souls to contemplaco^n / For after diverse
disposynges of men and after sundry states. as are religyous and seculers that
they are in. are diverse exercises in worchyng / Nevertheless there is no gate
but one / For what exercises it be that a soul has. but if he may come by
that exercise to this knowing and to a meke feeling of himself / and that is
that he be mortifyed and deed to the world as in his love / and that he may
fe^le himself sometime in this restful derkenes / by the which he may be hid
fro vanytee of the world as in his love. and yt he may feel himself what he
is sothly he is not yet come to the refourmynge in feeling / ne has not fully
contemplaco^n He is full far therfro / and if he woll come by any gate. he is
but a theyf and a breker of the wall / And therefore as unworthy he shall be
cast out / But he that can bring himself first to naught through grace of
mekenes and deye on this manner he is in the gate / for he is deed to the
world. and he lives to god / Of the which saint poul spekith thus: Col. ^.
Mortui enim estis et vita vestra abscondita est cu^ xp^o in deo / ye are deed
/ That is: ye that for the love of god forsaken all the love of the world are
deed to the world with christ in god / That is: ye live ghostly in the love of
Ihesu / But your life is hid from worldly men as christ lives and is hid in
his godhede fro the love and the sight of flesshly lovers / This gate our
lord himself showed in the gospel when he said thus / Om^is qui reliquerit
patrem aut matrem fratrem aut sororem propter me centuplu^ accipiet et vitam
etnam possidebit Every man that forsakyth for my love fader or mother suster or
brother / ^
or any good erthly he shall have an hundredth fold in this life / and
afterward the bliss of heaven / This hundredth fold that a soul shall have if
he forsake the world is naught but the profit of this lightly derkenes / the
which I call the gate of contemplaco^n / For he that is in this derkenes and
is hid thorugh grace fro worldly vanytee he coueyteth naught of worldly good
/ he sechyth it not / he is not tarried therwyth / he lokyth not after it / he
loves it not / And therefore has he an hundredth fold more than the king or
than he has that coueyteth most of erthly good / For he that naught
coueyteth but Ihesu has an hundredth fold / For he has more rest: more pees
in heart / more very love and delight in soul in one day thanne he that most
coueyteth of the world / And has all the well of it under his welht has in
all his life time /

This is then a good derkenesse and a rich naught that brings a soul to
so much ghostly ease and so stylle softness / I trow da^yd meaned of this
night / or of this naught when he said thus / Ad nichilum redactus sum et
nesciui / That is: I was brought to naught. P*
and I wyste not / That is The grace of our lord Ihesu sent in to mine heart
has slay ne in me / and brought to naught all the love of the world and I
wyste not how / For through no worchynge of myself ne by mine own wit I have
it not but of the grace of our lord Ihesu / And therefore me thynkyth he that
woll have the light of grace and fulsomly feel the love of Ihu^ in his soul
he must forsake all the false light or worldly love and abide in this derkenes /
And nevertheless if he be adradde first for to won^e therein torn not again to
the love of ye world but suffer awhyle: and put all his hope and his trust in
Ihesu / and he shall not long be without some ghostly light / Thus byddeth
the prophet / Qui ambulat in tenebris et non est lumen ei. ^
speret in dn^o and inuitatur super deum suu^ / who so gooth in derkenes and
has no light. that is: who so woll hyde him fro the love of the world and
may not redily feel light of ghostly love dispeyre not / torn not again to the
world but hope in our lord and leen upon him / that is: trust in god / and
clean to him by desire. and abide awhyle and he shall have lyight ^ For it
falls thereby as it does if a man had be a great while in the son / and
after that came suddenly in to a derke house there no son shyneth. he should
be as he were blind. and see right naught / But if he woll abide awhyle he
shall mow see soon about him / First great things and sythen small / And
sythen all that ever is in the house /

Right so it is ghostly: He that forsakyth the love of the world and comyth
to himself in to his own co^scye^ce y^ is first derke somewhat / and blind to
his syghte: But if he stand stylle and hold forth with besye prayenge and
often thynkyng of the same will to the love of Ihu^ / he shall mow see
afterward great things and small that he first knew not / Thus semith it yt
the prophet behight thus saye^g / Oriet in tenebris lux tua. and tenebre tue
eru^t sicnt merid^es: et reqe^ dabit tibi dn^s ds tuus et implebit ai^am tua^
splendoribus / Light shall spring to th in derkenesse / That is: Thou that
forsakest sothfastly the light of all worldly love and hydest thy thought in
this derkenes / light of blessed love and ghostly knowing of god shall spring
to the / and thy derkenes shall be as myddaye / that is thy derkenes of
traueylynge desire and thy blind trust in god y^ thou have first shall torn
in to clear knowing and in to sykernes of love / And thy lord god shall give
rest to the / That is Thy flesshly desires and thy paynfull dredes and
doubts: and wicked spirytes that have contynuelly before hand traueyled the
all thise shall worche and lose much of her might / and thou shall be made so
strong that they shall not dear y^ / For thou shall be hid in rest fro hem
/ And then shall our lord fulfylle thy soul with shynynges / That is: when
thou art brought in to this ghostly rest then^e shall thou more easily tente
to god and naught else do but love him / and then he shall with bemes of
ghostly light fulfill all the myghtes of thy soul. Have thou no wonder
though I call the forsak^^ge of worldly love derkenes / for the prophet
calls it so ^^ynge thus to a soul / Intra in tenebras tuas filia caldeorum
/ Goo in to thy derkenesse thou daughter of caldee / That is ^ Thou soul that
art as a daughter of Caldee for love of the world. forsake it and goo in to
thy derkenes /

That in refourmynge of a soul the worchynge of on^^ lord Ihesu is departed
in to four times / that is. calling rightynge: magnyfyenge and gloryfyenge /
Caplm xxviii.
LOo I have said to the a lytyl if thou coueyte for to be reformed in felyng
how thou shall dyspose the toward in thy forth gooing / Nevertheless I say not
that thou may do thus of thyselfe / For I wot well that our lord Ihesu
bryngith all this to the end where so he woll / For he oonly thorugh his
grace styreth a soul. and bryngyth it in to this derkenesse first: And sythen
in to light as the prophet says / Sicut tenebre eius. ita and lumen eius /
That is: ^
Right as the light of knowing and the feeling of ghostly love is of Ihu^ /
Right so the derkenes. that is the forsakinge of worldly love is of him for he
does all / He fourmyth and refourmith He fourmyth only by hymself^ but he
refourmith us with us For grace yeuen and aplienge of our will to grace
worcheth all this / And on what manner wise he does that. saint poul reherceth
thus / Quos deus p^scinit fieri conformes ymaginis filii eius hos vocauit. Et
quos vocauit hos iustificauit. Et quos instificauit hos magnificauit. Et quos
magnificauit hos et glificauit / These that god knew before should be made
shapely to the image of his sone. thise he called. thise he righted. thise he
magnyfyed: and thise he gloryfyed / Though thise words may be said of all
chosen souls in the lowest degree of charity that are reformed only in faith:
nevertheless they may be vndstonde more specially of thise souls that are
reformed in feeling to the which our lord god shewith much plente of grace
and does much more besynes about hem / For they are his own sons specially
that bear the full shappe and the lickenes of his sone Ihu^ / In the which
words saint poule departs the worchyng of our lord in four times / First
is ye time of caliynge of a soul fro worldly vanyte / and that time is often
easy and comfortable / For in begyn^ynge of tornynge such a man that is
disposed to much grace is so quyckely and so felyngly inspired. and felith
often so great swetnes of deuoco^n. and has so many teres in co^puncco^n yt he
thynkyth him sometime as he were half in heaven / but this softnes passyth after
for a time / And then^e comyth the second time that is ye time of rightynge
that is trauelous / For when he begyn^yth for to goo forth mytly in the way of
rightwisnes. and settith his will full against all syn^e without and within^ and
stretchith out his desire to virtues and to the love of Ihu^ then^e felyth he
much lettynge both with himself of frowardenes and hardness of his own will
/ and fro without forth through temptaco^n of his enmye that he is often in full
great tourment / And that is no wond / For he has so long be crooked to the false love of the world that he may not be made right / as a crokyd staff may
not be made even but if he be cast and weyked in ye fire / Therefore our lord
Ihu^ seenge se^deth what thing is ^^ houefull to a froward soul suffers it
to be traueyled and ta^^ed by sundry te^ptacyons. and for to be well examyned
thorugh ghostly trybulacyons that all the ruste of vnclen^es might ^^ burnt
out of it / And that shall be both within of (...) dowtes and perplexitees
that it shall nerehande fall in disper^^ and it shall seem as it were forsaken
of god and left all in the hondes of the fend out taken a lityll preuy trust
that (...) have in the godenes of god and in his mercy. For that preuy (...)
our lord leueth in such a soul goo he never so fe^re (...) it. by the
which the soul is borne up fro dispeyre and saved (...) ghostly myscheyf. And
also without itself it shall be (...) fyed and pyned in the se^sualyte /
either by diverse syknes or (...) able tourment of the fend. or else through a
preuy might (...) god the sely soul by feeling and berynge of the wrerched
bo^y shall be so pyned. and it shall not wit how that it shall (...) suffer
for to be in the body ne were that our lord Ihu^ kep^ (...) therein / And yet
nevertheless had ye soul lever for to be in (...) this pyne than for to be
blinded with the false love of ye wo^^de. for that were hell to such a soul /
But the sufferynge (...) this manner pyne is naught but purgatory / and
therefore he suffryth it gladly / And he would not put it away though he
might / for it is so prouffytable / All this does our (...) in great
prouffyte of the soul / for to drive it our of the sensualytee / that it
might receive ghostly light / For after this when the soul is thus mortyfyed
and brought fro worldely love in to this derkenesse / that it has no more
savor ne delight of worldly liking thanne of the straw / But he thynkyth it
bitter as wormode / Then commyth the third time of magnyfieng / And that is
when the soul is reformed in feeling in party. and receives the yeft of
perfecco^n and the grace of contemplaco^n / and that is a time of great rest /
for then^e is Ihu^ more homely with a soul / And after this comyth the fourth
time of glorifyenge / That is when the soul shall be fully reformed in the
bliss of heaven / For these souls that are thus called fro syn^e and thus
righted or else on other manner like by diverse assayenge both thorugh fire and
water. and afterward are thus magnyfied they should be gloryfied / For our
lord shall then^e give he^ fully that they here coueyted / and more than they
cowde co^eyte / for he shall areyse hem above al other chosen souls to the
eue^hede of cherubyn and seraphyn / sythen they passed all other in knowing
and loving of god here in this life / Therefore he that woll come to this
magnifye^g dread not this rightyng / for that is ye way For our lord says by
his prophet a word of great comfort to all such souls that are examyned
with fire of trybulacy on thus / Puer meus noli timere. Si transieris per igne^
flamma non nocebit te / That is: My child if thou pass thorugh fire dread not
for the fla^me shall not dear the / It shall cleanse the fro all flesshly
fylthe / and make the able to receive ghostly fire of the love of god / and
that needs for to be done first For as I have before said. it may not else
be reformed in feeling /

How it falls sometime that souls begyn^ynge at profytynge in grace seem to
have more love as by outward tokens than some have that been perfyte / and yet
it is not so in soth within / Caplm xxix:
But now say thou how may this be sothe / For there are many souls new
turned to god that have many ghostly felynges / Some have great co^puncco^n
for her sins. and some have great deuoco^ns and feruours in her prayers. and
often have sundry techinges of ghostly lite in vndstonding: and some me^ have
other manner felynges of comfortable hete and great swetnes / and nevertheless
thise souls come never fully in this restfull derkenes that I speak of with
fervent desire and lastyng love and thought in god / Then^e ask thou whether
thise souls be reformed in feeling or naught / It semyth yes. in asmoche as
they have such great ghostly felynges that other men that stand oonly in
faith feel not of / Unto this I may say as me thynkith. that thise ghostly
felynges whether they stand in compu^ccion or deuoco^n or in ghostly
ymaginacyon are not the felynges which a soul shall have and feel in ye grace
of conte^placo^n / I say not but they are sothfast and gracyously yeue^ of god
/ But these souls that felen such are not yet reformed in feeling. ne they
have not yet the yefte of perfecco^n ne ghostly the bren^inge love of Ihu^ as
they may come to / And nevertheless often it semyth otherwise: that such
souls feel more of the love of god than other that have the yefte of
perfecco^n / in asmoche as the felyng shewyth more outward by great fervor of
bodily tokens. in weeping prayenge kne^^^ge and speaking and other bodily
stirynge. so ferforth yt it semyth to a another man that they were ever
rauysshed in love / And though me thynkith it is not so / well I wot that
thise manner felinges and feruours of deuoco^n and co^puncco^n that thise me^
feel are gracious yeftes of god sent in to chosen souls for to draw hem out
of worldly love and flesshly lust that has been long time roted in her heart.
fro ye which love they should not be drawn out but by such feable stirige of
great feruours: ne^ theles yt the fervor is somoche in outward showing it is
not only for mochenes of love yt they have but it is for litylnes and weyknes
of her soul yt may not ber^ a lityl towching of god for it is yet as it were
fleshly festned to ye flessh^ and neu was yet deperted fro it by gostly
mortifye^g: and therefore ye lest towching of love and ye lest sperkil of
ghostly lyte sent fro heaven in to such a soul is somoche and so comfortable
and so delectable over al ye liki^g that ever it felt before in flesshly love
of erthly thing that it is overtaken with it / And also it is so new and
sodeyn and so uncouth that it may not suffer for to bear it but brestyth and
shewyth out in weeping sobbing and other bodily stirynge Right as the
costrell that is old when it receives new wine that is fresshe and mighty:
the costrell bolneth out and is in point for to cleue and breast until the
wine has boylled and spourged out all vnclen^esse / but also sone as the wine
is fined and cleryd then^e it stondeth still and the costrel hole / Right so a
soul that is old through syn^e when it receives a lityll of the love of god
that is so fresshe and so mighty that the body is in point for to cleue and
to break ne were that god kepith it hole But yet it brestyth out at the eyes
by weeping / and at ye mouth by speaking: and that is more for weyknes and
feebleness of the soul than for mykilnes of love / For afterward when love has
boylled all the vnclen^es out of the soul by such great feruours then^e is
the love clear and stondeth still: And then^e is both the body and the soul
much more in pees / and yet has ye soul much more love than it had before
though it show less outward / For it is now all hole in rest within: and
naught but lityll in outward showing of fervor / And therefore I say that
thise souls that fele^ such great bodily feruours though they ben in much
grace are not yet reformed in feeling / but they are greatly dysposed toward.
For I trow yt such a man namly that has be greatly defoylled in syn^e shall
not be reformed in feeling but if he be first burnt and puryfyed with such
great co^puncco^ns going before /

A another soul that never was much defoylled with love of the world but has
ever be kept fro great sin^es in innoce^ce may lyghtlyer and more pryuely
without great fervor showed outward come to this refourmyng / Then^e is this
soth as I hope that such comfortes and feruours that a soul felyth in the
state of begyn^ynge or of profytynge are as it were his ghostly food sent fro
heaven for to strength him in his traueyle / Right as a pilgryme traueyleth all
day meteles and drynkles^ and is nerehonde overcome with werynes falls at
the last to a good Inn. and there has he mete and drink / and is well
refresshed for the time / Right so ghostly: a devout soul that woll forsake
the love of the worlde^ and would feign love god / and settyth all his besynes
thereto: prays and traueylleth all day bodyly and ghostly / and sometime
feleth no comfort ne savor in deuocon / Then^e our lord having pity over
all his creatures that it should not perisshe for defawte ne torn in to
heaviness or grutchyng sends it among his ghostly fode and comfort it in
deuoco^n as he wouchith saaf / And when the soul feleth any comfort then^e
holds he him well paid for all his traueylle and all the disease that it had
on y^ day when it fares well at even by feeling of any grace / The self wise
falls it of other souls that are profitynge and ferfor the in grace They
felen often times gracyous towchynges of the holy ghost in her soul / both in
understanding and syghte of ghostly things and in affeccion of love / But yet
ben they not reformed in felyng / ne they are not yet perfyte / for why all
such felinges come to hem in that state as it were vnw^arly / for they come or
they wit it / and goth fro hem or they wit it / and they can not come thereto
again. ne wot not where they shall find it for they have not yet homlynes with
he^ of thought and lastyng desire in Ihu^ / ne the eye of her soul is not
opyned to the beholdynge of ghostly thynges^ but they nyghe fast toward. And
therefore they are not yet reformed in feeling / ne they have not yet the full
yefte of conte^placo^n /

On what manner a man shall have knowing of his own soul / and how a man
should set his love in Ihu^ god and man one person / Caplm xxx.
IT needs a soul that would have knowing of ghostly things for to have
first knowing of itself / For it may not have knowing of a kind above
itself but if it have knowing of itself / And that is when the soul is so
gadred in to itself / and departed fro beholding of al erthly things and fro
the use of bodily wits that it felyth itself as it is in y^ own kind
without a body / Then^e if thou coueyte for to know and see thy soul what it
is^ thou shall not torn thy thought with ymagynaco^n in to thy body for to
seek it and feel it as it were hid within thyn heart. as thy heart is hid
and holden within thy body / If thou seek so thou shall never find it in
itself / The more thou secheste for to find and feel it as y^ would feel a
bodily thing. the ferd thou art therfro / For thy soul is no body but a life
vnseable. not hid and holde^ with in thy body as a less thing is hid and
holden within a more but it is holding and quknyng thy body much more than
thy body is in might and in virtue / Then if thou wolt find it wythdraw thy
thought fro all bodily thing outward and fro mind of thyn own body. also
fro all thy five wits asmoche as thou may. and think on the kind of a
reasonable soul ghostly as thou would think for to know any virtue as
sothfastnes or mekenes or any other wertue / Right so think that a soul is a
life vndedely and vnseably / and has might in itself for to see and know
the souereyn sothfastnes^ and for to love the souereyne goodness that is god /
when thou see this then felest thou somewhat of thyself / Seek thyself in
none other place / but the more fully and the more clerly that you may think
of ye kind and the worthynes of a reasonable soul what it is. and what is the
kyndly werking of it the better see you thiselfe / It is full hard for a soul
that is rude and much in the flessh^ for to have sight and knowing of it or of
an angel or of god It falls anon in to ymagynaco^n of bodily shappe^ and it
weneth thereby for to have the sight of it self. and so of god and so of
ghostly things / And that may not be / For all ghostly things are seen and
known by understanding of the soul not by ymagynacyon / Right as a soul
sees by vndstondyng that the virtue of rightwysnes is for to give to every
thing that it owes to have / right so and on such a manner may the soul
see itself by understanding / Nevertheless I say not that thy soul shall rest
stylle in this knowinge / but it shall by this seek hyer knowing above itself
and that is the kind of god / For the soul is but a myrrour in the which you
shall see god ghostly / And therefore thou shall first find thy myrrour and
keep it bryghte and clean fro flesshly fylthe and worldly vanytee / and hold
it well up fro the earth that thou myt see it and our lord therein also / For to
this end traueylen all chosen souls in this life in her meaning and in her
intent. though they have not specially the feeling of this. And therefore it is
said before that many souls begin^yng and profityng have many great feruours
and much sweet deuocio^ and as it semith bre^nynge all in love. and yet have
they not perfytly love ne ghostly knowing of god / For wit thou well feel a
soul never so much fervor / somoche that him thikith that the body may not
bear it. or though he melte all in to weeping. aslonge as his thynkyng and his
beholding of god is most. or all in ymagynaco^n and not in vndstondyng. he
come not yet to perfyte love ne to conte^placion / For thou shall understood
that the lou^ of god is on three manner wise / Al are good. but echone is be^ter
than other / The first comyth only thruh^ faith without gracyous ymagynaco^n
or ghostly knowing of god / Thi^ love is in the leest soul that is reformed
in faith in the lo^^est degree of charity / And it is good: for it suffices to
salvation / The second love is that a soul felyth through faith and
ymagynaco^n of Ihu^ in his manhede. This love is better than the first when
the ymaginacyon is styred by grace? for why the ghostly eye is opened in
beholdinge of our lords manhede / The third love that the soul feleth through
ghostly sight of the godhede in the manhede as it may be seen here / that is
best and most worthy / and that is perfyte loue^ this love a soul felyth
not unto it be reformed in feeling / Souls begyn^ynge and profityng has not
this love. for they can not think on Ihu^ ne love him goodly but as it were al
manly and flesshly after the conditions and lyknes of man / and upon that
reward they shape all her worchynge in her thoughts and in her affecco^ns /
They dread him as a man and worship him and love him pryncypally in manly
ymagynaco^n and goo no ferder / As thus: If they have done amysse and
trespased against god they think then^e that god is wroth with hem as a man
should if they had trespassed against him / and therefore they fall down as it
were to the fete of our lord with sorrow of heart and cryen mercy / And when
they done thus they have a good trust that our lord of his mercy woll foryeue
hem her trespass / This manner of doing is right good / but it is not ghostly
as it might be / Also when they woll worship god they present hem in her
thought as they were before our lords face in a bodily lyckenes. and ymagyn a
wondfull lyh^yte there our lord Ihu^ is / and then they reverence him and
worship him and dread him / and fully put hem in his mercy for to do with hem
what he woll / Also wha^ they woll love god they behold him worship him and
dread him as a man. not yet as god in man either in his passion or in some
other thing of his manhede and in that beholdynge they feel her hertes much
stired to ye love of god / This manner of worchynge is good and gracyous / but
it is much less and lower than is the worching of understanding / That is
when the soul gracyously beholds god in man / For in our lord Ihesu are
two kinds. the manhede. and the godhede / Then right as the godhede is more
souereyne and more worthy thanne is the manhede / Rygh so the ghostly
beholdynge of the godhede in Ihesu man is more worthyer. and more ghostlyer.
and more medefull thanne beholdynge of the manhede alone / whether he behold
the manhede as dedly or as glorified / And right so by the same skyll the love
that a soul felyth in thinkyng and beholdynge of the godhede in man when it is
gracyously showed is worthyer ghostlyer and more medefull than the fervor o^
deuoco^n that the soul feleth by ymagynaco^n only of the ma^hede show it
never somoche outward / For in reward o^ y^ this is but ma^ly / for our lord
shows him not in ymagynaco^n as he is. ne that he is / for the soul might
not that time for freelte of the flesshede suffer it so / Nevertheless unto
such souls that can not think of the godhede ghostly that they should not
err in her deuoco^n^ but that they should be comforted and strengthed through
some manner Inward beholdynge of Ihu^ for to forsake syn^e and the love of the
world. therefore our lord Ihu^ tempreth his vnseable light of his godhede
and cl^theth it under bodile liknes of his manhede. and shewith it unto the
Inner eye of a soul. and fedeth it with the love of his precious flesh
ghostly / The which love is of so great might that it sleeth al wicked love
in the soul and strength it for to suffer bodily penance and other bodily
disease in time of ne^^ for love of Ihesu / And this is the shadowyng of our
lord Jesus over a chosen soul. in the which shadowyng the soul i^ kept fro
bren^ynge of worldly love / For right as a shadow is made of a light and of a
body: right so this ghostly shadow is made of the blessed vnseable light of
the godhede and of the manhede ooned thereto showed to a deuowte soul / of the
which shadow the prophet says thus / Sp^sante facie^ nostra^ xp^s dn^s sub
vmbra eius viuemus int gentes / Our lord christ before our face as a spirit
under his shadow we shall live a mo^ge folk / That is our lord Ihu^ in his
godhede is a spyryte that may not be seen of us living in flesh as he is in
his blessed light / therefore we shall live under the shadow of his manhede as
long as we are here / But though this be sooth that this love in ymaginacyon
be good / Nevertheless a soul should desire for to have ghostly love in
understanding of the godhede. for that is the end and the full bliss of the
soul / and all bodily beholdynges are but means ledynge a soul to it / I say
not that we should refuse the manhede of Ihu^ and depart god fro man. but thou
shall in Ihu^ man behold dread. wonder. and love ghostly the godhede / And so
shall you without de partynge love god in man^ and both god and man ghostly
and not flesshly / Thus taught our lord mary mawdeleyne that should be
contemplatyfe. Joh^. x.
when he said thus / Noli me tangere non du^ enim ascendi ad patrem meu^ /
Towche me not I am not yet styed up to my fader / That is to say: Mary
magdalene loved well our lord Ihu^ before the time of his passion / but her
love was much bodily and lityl ghostly / She trowed well that he was god but
she loved him lityll as god / for she kouth not then^e / and therefore she
suffered al her affecco^n and al her thought fall in him as he was in form of
man / And our lord blamed her not then^e but praised it much / But after when
he was risen fro death and appeared to her she would have worshypped him with
such manner love as she did before / and then^e our lord forbode her and said
thus / Towche me not: That is. Set not thy rest ne the love of thyn heart in
that form of man that thou see with thy flesshly eye only for to rest
therein: For in that form I am not stied up to my fader. That is I am not even
to the fader: for in that form of man I am less than he: Towche me not so.
but set thy thought and thy love in that form in which I am even to the
fader / that is the form of the godhede / and love me: know me. and worship
me as god and man godly / not as a man ma^ly / So shall thou touch me / For
sythen I am both god and man. and all the cause why I shall be loved and
worshipped is for I am god / and for I took the kind of man / And therefore
make me a god in thine heart and in thine love / And worship me in thine
understanding as Ihesu god and man: souereyne sothfastnes and souereyne
godenes and blessed life for that I am / And thus taught our lord her as I
understand and also all other souls that are disposed to conte^placion and
able thereto that they should do so / Nevertheless other souls that are not
subtle in kind. ne are not yet made ghostly through grace it is good to hem
that they keep forth her own worchynge in ymagynaco^n with manly affecco^n
unto more grace come freely to hem / It is not syker to a man to leave one good
thing utterly till he see and feel a better / Upon the self wise it may be
said of other manner felynges that are like to bodily / as herynge of delectable
song / or feeling of comfortable hete in the body: seenge of light. or
swetnes of bodily savor / Thise are not ghostly felynges. for ghostly felynges
are felt in the myghtes of the soul / pryncipally in understanding and love.
and lityll in ymagynaco^n / But thise felynges are felt in the myghtes of the
body in ymaginaco^n / and therefore they are not ghostly felynges / But wha^
they are best and most true. yet are they but outward tokens of the July
grace that is felt in the myghtes of the soul / This may be openly preued by
holy wrytt saying thus / Apparueru^t aplis dispertite (...) taqm^ ignis.
seditque supra singlos eorum sp^s scu^s / The ho^ly ghost appeared to thapostles
in the day of pentecost in y^ li^kenes of bren^ynge tongues and enfla^med her
hertes. and set upon each of hem / Now soth it is ye holy ghost that is god
in himself vnseable was not that fire ne the tongues that were seen. ne that
bren^ing that was felt bodily. but he was vnseable felt in the myghtes of her
souls / for he lyghtned her reason / and kyndeled her affecco^n through his
blessed precense so clere^i and so bren^yngly that they had suddenly the
ghostly knowing of sothfastnes and the perfecco^n of love as our lord behyght
he^ saying thus / Sp^s scu^s docebit vos oe^m veritate^ / That is. Io^.
ye holy ghost shall teache you al sothfastnes / then^e was ye fire and yt
bren^yg naught else but a bodily token outward showed in wytnessynge of that
grace that was Inwardly felt / And as it was in hem / so is it in other
souls that are vysited and lyghtned within of the holy ghost. and has with
that such outward feeling in comfort and wytnessyng of the grace in ward /
But that grace is not as I hope in all souls that are perfyte but there our
lord woll / Other Inperfyte souls that have such felynges outward and have
not yet received Inward grace it is not good to hem to rest in such felinges
outward / but in as much as they help the soul to more loue^ and to more
stablynesse of thought in god / For some may be true and some may be feyned
as I have said before /

How this manner of speaking of refourmynge in feeling of a soul shall be take
And on what wise it is reformed and how it is found in saint poules words /
Caplm xxxi.
NOw I have said to the a lityll of refourmynge in faith. and also I have
towched to the a lityll of the forth-goynge fro that refourmyng to the higher
refourmyng that is in feeling. Not in that intent that I would by thise words
set goddis worchynge vnd a law of my spekinge. As for to say thus worcheth
god in a soul and none other wise / Nay I mean not so. But I say after my
simple felinge that our lord worcheth thus in some creatures as I hope / And
I hope well that he worcheth other wise also that passyth my wit and my
feeling / Nevertheless whether he worche thus or other wise by sundry means in
longer time or shorter time / with much traueyle or lityll traueyle / if all
come to one end. that is to the perfect love of him / then^e it is good enough
/ For if he wolle give one soul on one day the full grace of contemplaco^n
and without any traueyle as he well may / as good is y^ to that soul as if he
had be examyned pynyd mortifyed and purifyed twenty winter / And therefore upon
this manner wise take in my saying as I have said. and namly as I think to
say / For now by the grace of our lord Ihesu shall I speak a lityll as me
thinks more openly of refourmyng in felyng what it is and how it is made. and
which are ghostly felynges that a soul receives / Nevertheless first that I
take not this manner of speaking of refourmyng of a soul in feeling as feynyng
or fantasye / therefore I shall ground it in saint poullis words where he
says thus / Nolite co^formari huic sclosed reformamini in nouitate sensus
vestri / That is: ye that are through grace reformed in faith conform you not
hensforwarde to the manners of the world in pride in couetyse and in other
sins. but be ye reformed in newehede of feeling / Loo here thou may see
that saint poul spekyth of refourmynge in feeling / And what that new feeling
is. he expowneth in a another place thus / Vt impleamini in agnicio^e volu^tatis
eius in om^i intellectu et sapi^a spu^ali / That is: we pray god that ye may
be fulfilled in knowinge of goddis will in all vndstondynge and in all manner
ghostly wysdom / This is refourmynge in feeling / For thou shall understand
that the soul has ii. manner of felinges One without of ye five bodili wits.
a another within of ye ghostly wits the which are properly the myghtes of the
soul / Mind reason and will / when these myghtes are through grace fulfilled
in all understanding of the will of god and ghostly wysdom then^e has the
soul new gracyous felynges / That this is soth he shows in a another place
thus / Renouamini sp^u mentis vestre et induite nouu^ hoi^em q scdm deu^
creatus est in iusticia: sci^tate and vitate Be ye renewed in spirit of your
soul / That is: ye shall be reformed not in bodily feeling ne in ymaginacion
but in the over party of your reason / And clothe you in a new man yt is
shapen after god in rightwysnes holiness and sothfastnesse That is: your
reason yt is properli the image of god through grace of the holy ghost shall be
clothed in a new light of sothfastnesse / holiness. and ryghtwysnes / And
then it is reformed in feeling / For when the soul has perfyte knowing of
god then it is reformed / Thus says saint poul / Expoliantes vetere^
homine^ cu^ actibus suis induite nouu^ qui re nouatur in agnico^ne dei scdm
ymagine^ eius qui creauit eum / Spoil yourself of the old man with all his
deeds That is cast fro you the love of the world with all worldly manners And
clothe you in a new man: Col. 3.
That is: ye shall be renewed in the knowing of god after the lycknes of him
that made you / By these words thou may vndstonde that saint poul would have
men^es souls reformed in perfyte knowing of god. for that is the new feeling
that he spekyth of generally And therefore upon his words I shall say more
openly of this reformyng as god yeueth me grace / For there is two manner
knowing of god / One is had pryncipally in ymagynacyon. and lityll in
vndstondyng / This knowinge is in chosen souls begyn^yng and prouffitynge in
grace that known god. and louen him all manly. not ghostly with manly
affecco^ns and with bodily lyknes as I have before said / This knowing is
good. and it is lykned to milk by the which they are tendly nouryshed as
childn until they ben able for to come to the faders board and take of his
hand hole bread. A another knowing is pryncypally feled in understanding and
lityll in ymagynaco^n / For the understanding is lady and the ymagynaco^n is a
maiden serving to the vndstondyng when need is / ^rnowyng is hole bread mete
for perfyte souls / and it is refourmynge in feeling /

How god opens the In^er eye of the soul to see him not all at ones but by
diverse times / And of three manner of refourmyng of a soul by ensample / Caplm
xxxii.
A Soul that is called fro the love of world and after that is righted and
assayed. mortifyed and purifyed as I have before said: our lord Ihesu of his
merciful goodness refourmyth it in feeling when he wouchyth saaf / He opens
the Inner eye of the soul when he lyghtneth the reason through towchynge and
shinynge of his blessed light for to see him and know him. not all fully
attones / but lityll and lityll by diverse times as the soul may suffer him /
He sees him not what he is. for that may no creature do in heaven ne in
earth / Nor he sees him not as he is / for that sight is only in y^ bliss of
heaven / But he sees him. that he is an vnchanble being: a souereyne might:
souereyne sothfastnes: souereyne goodness: a blessed life: an endless bliss /
This sees the soul and much more that comyth with al not blyndly and nakydly
and vnsauourly as does a clerk that sees him by his clergy only through
might of his naked reason / but he sees him in understanding that is
comforted and lyghted by the yefte of ye holy ghost with a wonderful
reverence and a preuy bren^nyng love. and with ghostly savor and heavenly
delight more clerly and more fully than it may be written or said / This syghte
though it be but shortly and lityll is so worthy and so mighty that it
draws and rauyssheth all the affecco^n of the soul fro beholding and the
mind of all erthly thing thereto for to rest therein evermore if it might /
And of this manner of syghte and knowing the soul groundeth all his worchynge
inward in all the affecco^ns / For then it dredeth god in man as
sothfastnesse wondreth him as might / loves him as goodness / This ^^ighte and
this goodness and this knowing of Ihesu with y^ blessed love that comyth out of
it. may be called refourmyng of a soul in feeling. and in faith that I speak
of.

It is in faith / For it is derke yet as in reward of that full knowing of
Ihesu with the blessed love that comyth out of it that shall be in heaven / For
then shall we see him not oonly that he is. but as he is / As saint Ioh^n
says / p^. ^^.iiii
Tunc videbimus eum sicut est / That is: Then shall we see him as he is /
Nevertheless it is in feeling also as in reward of that blind knowing that a
soul has stondynge oonly in faith / For this soul knowyth somewhat of the
very kind of Ihesu god through his gracyous syghte / but that other knowyth
not. but oonly trowith it is soth / Nevertheless that thou ye better may
conceive what I mean I shall show these three manner refourmynge of a soul by
ensample of three men sto^dyng in the light of the son^e / Of the which three
one is blynde^ a another may see but he has his eyes stopped / the third
lokyth forth full syghte / The blind man has no manner knowing that he is in
the son^e / but he trowyth it if a true man tell him / And he betokens a
soul that is only reformed in faith yt trowyth in god as holy church
techeth and wot not what / This suffyceth as for salvation / That other man
sees a light of the son^e^ but he sees it not clerly what it is for the lydde
of is eye lets him that he may not see / But he sees through the lydde of
his eye a glymerynge of great light And he betokenyth a soul that is
reformed in faith and in felyng: and so is he conte^platyfe / for he sees
somewhat of the godhede of Ihu^ through grace / Not clerly ne fully. for the
lydde that is his bodily kind is yet a wall bytwixe his kind and ye kind of
Ihu^ god and lettyth him fro the clear syghte / But he sees through this wall
after that grace towchyth him more or less that Ihu^ is god. and that Ihu^ is
souereyne goodness and souereyne being. and a blessed life / and all that other
goodness comyth of him / Thus sees the soul by grace notayensto^dyng the
bodily kind. and the more clean and subtle that the soul is made. and the
more it is departed fro flesshlyhede the sharper sight it has and the
myghtyer love of ye godhede of Ihu^ / This syghte is so mighty that though
none other man living would trow in Ihu^ ne love him he would never trow ye
less ne love him the less: for he sees it sothfastly that he may not vntrowe
it / The third man yt has full syghte of the son^e he trowyth it not / for he
sees it fully / And he betokens a full blessid soul that without any wall
of body or of syn^e sees openly the face of Ihu^ in the bliss of heaven /
There is no faith / and therefore he is fully reformed in felyng / There is no
state above the second refourmynge that a soul may come to here in this life.
for this is the state of perfeccyon and the way to heue^warde. Nevertheless all the souls that are in this state are not all like ferforth. For some has it
lityll shortly and seildom. and some le^ger clerer and oftiner: and some has
it best clerest and lengest after the abou^dinge of grace / and yet all these
have the yefte of conte^placo^n / For the soul has not perfyte sight of Ihu^
all at ones / but first a lityll and a little / and after that it profyteth
and comyth to more feeling / And aslonge as it is in this life it may wax
more in knowing and in this love of Jesus / and sothly I wot not what were more
leyf to such a soul that has felt a lytill of it than utterly all other
things left and set at naught. Tent only thereto for to have clerer sight
and clenner love of Ihu^ in whom is all the blessed trynyte. This manner knowing
of Ihu^ as I vndstonde is the openinge of heaven to the eye of a clean soul of
the which holy me^ speak of in her writing / Not as some wene that the
opening of heaven is as if a soul might see by ymagynaco^n thru^ the skies
above the fyrmament how our lord Ihu^ sytteth in his mageste in a bodily
light as much as an hundredth son^es Nay it is not so. ne though he see
never so high on y^ manner sothly he sees not the ghostly heaven / The higher
he styeth above the son^e for to see Ihu^ god so by such ymagynaco^n. the
lower he falls bineth the son^e. Nevertheless this manner syghte is sufferable
to simple souls that can no better seche him that is vnseable /

How Ihu^ is heaven to the soul. and why he is called fire / Caplm xxxiii.
WHat is heaven to a reasonable soul / Sothly noughteelles but Ihesu god / For
if that be heaven oonly that is above al thing / then^e is god only heaven
toman^es soul for he is only above ye kind of a soul / then^e if a soul
may thorugh grace have knowing of that blessed kind of Ihu^* sothly he sees
heaven for he sees god / Therefore there are many men that erren in vndstondynge
of some words that are said of god / for they understand hem not ghostly /
Holy writing says that a soul that wol find god shall lift upward the
Inner eye and seek god above itself / Then some men that would do after
this saying understand this word above hemself as for higher setting instead and worthynes of place as one elemente or planete is above a another in
setting and worthiness of a bodily place / But it is not so ghostly. For a
soul is above all bodily thing: not by setting of stead: but by subtyltee
and worthynes of kind / Right so on the self wise god is above all bodily
and ghostly creatures not by setting of stead but through subtyltee and
worthynes of his unchangeable blessed kind And therefore he yt wol wisely seche
god and find him he shall not ren^e out with his thought as he would clyme
above the son^e and part the fyrmament and ymagin ye mageste as it were of an
hundred sons / he shall rather draw down the son and all the fyrmament
and forgete it. and cast it beneth him there he is. and set all this and all
bodily thing also at naught / and think then^e if he can ghostly both of
himself and of god also / And if he do thus: then^e sees the soul above
itself / then^e sees it in to heaven. Upon this self manner shall this word
within be understand / It is comynly said that a soul shall see our lord
within all thing and within itself / Soth it is that our lord is within al
creatures. but not on that manner that a kernel is hyd within the shell of a
nutte. or as a lityll bodily thing is holden within a another much / but he is
within all creatures as holding and keeping hem in her being through subtylte
and might of his own blessed kind and clennes vnseable / For right as a
thing that is most precious and most clean is laid inerest / right so by
that lyknes it is said that the kind of god that is most precious most clean
and most goodly ferrest fro bodilyhede is hid within all things / And
therefore he that woll seek god within he shall gorgete first all bodily things
for all that is without. and his own body / and he shall forgete thynkyng of
his own soul. and think on the unmade kind. that is Ihu^ that made him:
quiknith him. holdith him. and yeueth him reason and mind and love the which
is within him through his might and souereyne subtylte / Upon this manner shall
the soul do when grace to wchyth it. or else it woll but lityl avail to
seche Ihesu. and to find him within itself and within all creatures as me
thynkyth / Also it is said in holy writ that god is light / So says saint
Ioh^n. Deus lux est / That is. God is light / This light shall not be
understand as for bodily light but it is understood thus / God is light.
That is. God is troth and sothfastnesse / for sothfastnes is ghostly light /
Then^e he that most gracyously knowyth sothfastnes best sees god / And
nevertheless it is lykened to the bodily light for this skylle / Right as the
son shows to the bodily eye itself and all bodily thing by it / right so
sothfastnes that is god shows to the reason of the soul itself first. and
by itself all other ghostly thing that needs to the knowing of a soul /
Thus says the prophet / Dn^e in lumine tuo videbimus lumen / Lord we shall
see thy light by thy light / That is: we shall see the tha^ art sothfastnes by
thyselfe / On the self wise it is said that god is fire / Deus noster ignis
consumens est: That is (...) lord is fire wasting / That is for to say: God
is not fire elementare that heteth a body and bren^eth it / but god is love and
charity / For as fire wastes all bodily thing that may be wasted / Right so
the love of god brenneth and wastes all sin out of the soul. And makyth it
clean as fire makyth clean all manner metalle / These words and all other
that arne spoken of our lord in holy writ by bodyly lyckenesse must needs
be understand ghostly: Else there is no ^a^our in hem / Nevertheless the
cause why such manner words are said of our lord in holy writ is this /
For we are so flesshly that we can not speak of god ne understand of him but
if we by such words first be entered in / Nevertheless when the Inner eye is
opened through grace for to have a lityll sight of Ihu^ / then^e shall the soul
torn lightly enough all such words of bodily things in to ghostly
understanding / This goostly opening of the Inner eye in to knowing of the
godhede I call refourmynge in faith and feeling / for then^e the soul somewhat
feleth in understanding of that thing that it had before in naked trowynge.
and that is the begyn^ynge of contemplaco^n / of the which saint poul says
thus / Non conte^plantibus nobis que vident sed que no^ videntur Quia que
videntur te^poralia su^t. S. cor iiii*
que aute^ non videntur etna sunt / That is: Our contemplaco^n is not in
things that are seen. but it is in things vnseable / For things that are
see^ are passing. but vnseable things are everlasting / to the which syghte
every soul should desire for to come to both here in party and in the bliss
of heaven fully / For in that sight and in that knowing of Ihu^ is fully the
bliss of a reasonable soul and endless life Thus says our lord / Hec est aute^
vita eterna vt cognosca^tte verum deu^ et quem misisti ih^m xp^m / (...). vii.
That is: Fader this is endless life that thy chosen souls know the and thy
sone whom thou haste sent one sothfaste god /

Of two manner of love reformed and vnfourmed what it meanyth / And how we be
behold to love Ihu^ much for our making / but more for our again byenge /
but all thermooste for our saving through the yeftes of his love / caplm xxxiiii.
But now wondrest thou sythen this knoweng of god is the bliss and the end of
a soul? why then have I said here before that a soul should not else
coueyte but oonly the love of god / I spoke no thing of this sight that a
soul should coueyte this / Unto this may I say thus / that the sight of
Ihesu is full bliss of a soul: and that is oonly for the sight but it is also
for the blessed love that comyth out of that syghte / Nevertheless for love
comyth out of knowing and not knowing out of love / therefore it is said that
in knowing and in syghte pryncypally of god with love is y^ bliss of a soul
and the more he is known the better he is loved / But for asmoche as to this
knowing or to this love that comyth of it. may not the soul come without love
/ therefore said I that you sholdest coueyte love / for love is cause why a soul
comyth to this knowing and to this love that comyth of it / And o^ what manner
that is I shall tell the more openly / Holy writers saye^ and soth it is that
there is two manner of ghostly ^^ue / One is called fourmed. a another is called
vnfourmed / Love unformed is god himself the third person in the ^^^nyte.
that is the holy ghost / He is love vnfourmed and (...) as saint Ioh^n says /
Deus dilecco^ est / God is love: (...) is the holy ghost / Love fourmed is the
affection of the (...) made by the holy ghost of the syghte and of the knowing
(...) sothfastnes that is god. oonly styred and set in him / (...) love is
called fourmed for it is made by the holy ghost / (...) love is not god in
himself for it is made. but it is the love (...) the soul felt of the syghte
of Ihesu and stired to him (...) Now may you see that love formed is not cause
why a (...) comyth to the ghostly syghte of Ihesu / And some men (...) think
that they would love god so brennyngly as it (...) by their own mighte^ that
they were worthy for to have the ghostly knowing of him / Nay it is not so.
But love (...) fourmed that is god himself is cause of all this knowing / For
a blind wretched soul is so far fro the clear knowing and the blessed
feeling of his love thorugh sin and freelte of the bodily kind that it
might never come to it. ne were it the endless mochenes of the love of god /
But then by cause he loves us so much therefore he yeueth us his love that
is the holy ghost / He is the yeuer and the yeft. and makes us then by that
yefte for to know and love him / ^o this is the love that I spoke of that thou
sholdest only coueyte and desire this vnfourmed love that is the holy ghost /
For sothly a less thing or a less yefte than he is may not avail us for to
bring us to the blessed sight of Ihu^ / And therefore should we fully desire
and ask of Ihu^ only this yefte of love that he would for the mochenes of his
love so blessed towche our hertes with his vnseable light to the knowing of
him and depart with us of his love that as he loves us that we might love
him again / Thus says saint Ioh^n / ^os diligamus deu^ qm^ ip^e prior delixit
nos / That is: p^. John.
Love we god now for he first loved us / He loved us much when he made us to
his liknes* but he loved us more when he boute us with his precious blood
through wylful taking of death in his ma^hede fro the power of the fend and
fro the pyne of hell. but he loves us most when he yeueth us the yefte of
the holy ghost that is loue^ by the which we know him and love him. and are
made syker that we are his sons chosen to salvation / For this love are we
more to him bound than for any other love that ever showed he for us. either
in our making or in our aye^byenge / For though he had made us and boughte us:
but if he save us with all? what profyteth it else to us our making or our
byenge / Sothly right naught / Therefore the most token of love showed to us
as me thinks is this / That he yeueth himself in his godhede to our souls /
He gaaf him self first in his manhede to us for our Raunson when he offered
himself to the fader of heaven upon the awter of the cross /

This was a right fair yefte and a right great token of love / But what time
he gives himself in his godhede ghoostly to our souls for our salvation /
And makes us for to know him. and for to love him / Then louyth he us fully
/ for then yeueth he himself to us / and more might he not give us / ne
less might not suffyce to us / And for this skylle it is said that the
ryghtyng of a sinful soul thorugh foryeuenesse of sins is arected and
appropered pryncypally to the worchynge of the holy ghost / For the holy
ghost is love / And in the ryghtynge of a soul our lord Ihesu shows to a
soul most of his love / for he does away all sin and oonyth it to him / And
that is the best thing that he may do to a soul / and therefore it is
appropred to the holy ghost / The making of the soul is appropred to the
fader. as for the souereyne might and power that he shewyth in making of it /
The byenge of it is aretted to the sone as for the souereyne wit and wisdom
that he showed in his manhede / For he overcome the fend pryncypally through
wysdom and not thorugh strength / But the ryghtynge an^ the full saving of a
soul by foryeuenesse of sins is apr^pred to the third person that is the
holy ghost / For therein shows Ihesu most love unto man^es soul / And for
th^^ thing shall he be most loved of us again / His making i^ comen to us
and to all unreasonable creatures / For as he made us of naught. so made he
hem / And therefore is this we^ke greteste of might. but not most of love /
Also the bye^^ge is comen to us and to all reasonable souls / as to Jews ^
^arracyns and to falls christian men / For he deyed for all soule^ ylyke / and
bought hem. if they woll have the perfyte love (...) it / And also it suffyceth
for the bienge of all though it be so^ that all have it not / And this work
was most of wisdom not most of love / But the ryghtynge and the halowyng of
our souls through the yefte of the holy ghost. that is oonly ye worchynge of
love. And that is not comen but it is specyalle gift oonly to chosen souls /
And sothly that is most worchynge of love to us that are his chosen chylderne

This is the love of god that I spoke of which thou should coueyte and desire:
for this love is god himself and the holy ghost / This love unformed when it
is yeuen to us it worcheth in our soul all that good is* and all that longs
to godenes / This love loves us or that we love him. for it cle^seth us first
of our sins: and makyth us for to love him. and makyth our will strong for
to ayenstonde all sins: and styreth us for to assaye ourself through diverse
exercise both bodily and ghostly in all virtues / It stireth us also for to
forsake the syn^e and flesshly affecco^ns and worldly dredes / It keeps us fro
malycyous temptaco^ns of the fende^ and dryueth us out fro besynes and vanyte
of the world: and fro conuersaco^n of worldly lovers / All this does the love
of god vnfourmed when he yeueth himself to us / we do right naught but suffer
him and assente to him: for that is the most that we do that we assente
wylfully to his gracyous worchyng in us / And yet is not that will of us but of
his making: so that me thinkyth that he does in us all that is well done. and
yet see we it not / And not only does he thus: but after this love does
more. for he opens the eye of the soul. and shewith to the soul y^ syghte
of Ihu^ wonderfully: and the knowing of him as the soul may suffer it thus by
little and by little. and by ye syghte he rauyssheth all the affection of the
soul to him. and then^e begyn^eth the soul for to know him ghostly and
bren^yngly for to love him / Then^e sees the soul somewhat of the kind of the
blessed godhede of Ihu^ how that he is all and that he worcheth all. and that
al good deeds yt are done and good thoutes are only of him for he is al
souerein myt and al souerein sothfastnes and al souereyne godenes / And
therefore every good deed is done of him and by him. and he shall only have ye
worship and the thank for all good deeds and no thing but he / For though
wretched me^ stele his worshypp here for a while / Nevertheless at the last
end shall sothfastnesse show well that Ihesu did all* and man did right
naught of him sefe / And then shall thieves of gods good that are not
acorded with him here in this life for her trespaas be demyd to death. and Ihesu
shall be fully worshypped and thanked of all blessed creatures for his
worchynge / This love is not else but Ihu^ himself that for love worcheth all
this in man's soule^ and refourmeth it in feeling to his lyknes as I have
before said and some what as I shall say / This love brings in to the soul
the full head of all virtues and makyth him all clean and true soft and easy.
and torneth him all in to love and in to likynge / And on what manner wise he
does that. I shall tell the a lityll afterward / This love drawyth the soul
fro vain beholdynge of worldly things in to conte^placyon of ghostly
creatures and of goddis pryuitees / fro flesshlihede in to ghostlynes / fro
erthly feeling in to heavenly savor:

How that some soul loves Ihu^ by bodily feruours and by her own manly
affecco^ns that been styred by grace and by (...) And how some louen Ihu^ more
restfully by ghostly affecc^o^s oonly styred Inward through special grace of
the holy ghost* Caplm xxxv.
Then may I say that he that most has of this lo^^ here in this life
most pleseth god. and most clear (...) shall have of him / and most fully
love him in the (...) of heaven / for he has the most yeft of love here in earth
/ The love may not be had by a man^es own traueyle as some (...) / It is
freely had of the gracyous yefte of Ihu^ after moch^ bodily and ghostly
traueyle going before / For there are some ^^uers of god that make^ hemself to
love god as it were by her own might / for they streyne hemself through great
vyolence and panten so strongly that they brast in to bodily feruours as they
would draw donwe god fro heaven to hem / And they sayen in her hertes and with
her mouth / A lord I love the and I would love the: I would for thy love
suffer death / And in this manner of worchynge they feel great fervor and much
grace / And soth it is me thinks this worchynge is good and medfull if it be
well tempred with mekenes and with discrecyon / But nevertheless these men love
not ne have not the yefte of love on that manner as I speak of: ne they ask it
not so / For a soul that has the yeft of love through gracyous beholdynge of
Ihesu as I mean. or else if he have it not yet: but would have it. he is not
besy for to strain himself over his might as it were by bodyly strength for
to have it by bodyly feruours: and so for to feel the love of god. but him
thynkyth that he is right naught* and that he can do right naught of
himself. but as it were a deed thing only hangyng and borne up by the mercy of
god / He sees well that Ihu^ is all and does all. and therefore asks he
naught else but the yefte of love For sythen that the soul sees that his
own love is naught. therefore it would have his love for that is enough /
Therefore prays he and that desires he that the love of god would towche him
with his blessed light that he might see a little of him by his gracyous
presence: for then should he love him / And so by this way comyth the yefte
of love that is god in to a soul / The more that a soul noughtith itself
through grace by sight of this sothfastnes some time without any fervor
outward showed. and the less that it thinkith that it loves or sees god. the
nerer it nygheth for to perceive the yefte of the blessed love / For then is
love master and worcheth in the soul: and makes it forgete itself. and for
to see and behold only how love does / And then^e is the soul more
suffrynge than doing. and that is clean love / Thus saint poul meaned when he
said thus / Quicu^que sp^u dei agunt hii filii dei su^t / All thise that are
wrought with the spirit of god are goddis sons. Ro^ viii
y^ is souls y^ are made so meke and so buxom^ to god yt they work not of
hemself. but suffer ye holy ghost stire hem and worche hem in the felynges of
love with a sweet cord to his styrynges / These arne specially goddis sons
most like unto him / Other souls that can not love thus but traueylen hemself
by her own afflycco^ns and styre hemself through her own thinking of god and
bodily exercise for to draw out of hemself by maystry the feeling of love by
feruours and other bodily signs love not ghostly / They (...) ne well and
medefully if so that they woll know mekely that her werchyng is not the
kyndely gracyous felyng of love. but it is manly doing by a soul at the
biddynge of reason / And nevertheless through the godenes of god by cause that
the soul does that in it is. thise manly affecco^ns of the soul stired (...)
to god by man's werchynge are turned in to ghostly affe^^co^ns. and are
medefull as if they had be done ghostly in ye f^^ste beginning / And this is a
great curtesye of our lord showed to meke souls that torneth all these manly
affeccyons of kindly love in to the affecco^n and in to the mede of his own
love: as if he had wroughte hem all fully by himself / And (...) thise manly
affecco^ns so turned may be called affecco^ns (...) ghostly love through
purchase not through kyndly bryngyng fourth of the holy ghost / I say not that
a soul may worche ^^che manly affecco^ns only of itself without grace / for
(...) well that saint poul says that we may right naught (...) ne think
that good is of ourself without grace / Non (...) sumus sufficie^tes cogitare
aliquid ex nobis quasi ex nobis. (...) sufficie^cia nr^a ex deo e^ / That is.
we that love god wene (...) that we suffyse for to love or for to think good
of ourself^ oonly / but our suffisynge is of god / For god worcheth in (...)
both good work and good will as saint poul says / Deus ^ qui operat in nobis
et velle and perficere pro bona volu^tate / That is: It is god that worcheth in
us good will and fulfyllynge of good will / But I say that such affecco^ns
are good made by the will and mean of a soul after the general grace that he
yeueth to all chosyn souls / not of special grace made goostly by towchynge
of his gracyous presence as he worcheth in his perfyte lovers as I said before
/ for in imperfect lovers love worcheth ferly by the affeccio^s of man. but
inperfyte lovers love werchyth nerely by her own ghostly affeccions: and
sleeth in a soul for the time all other affecco^ns both flesshly kyndly and
manly. and y^ is properly the werchynge of love by him self / Thus love may
be had in a little in party here in a clean soul through the ghostly syghte of
Ihu^. but in the bliss of heaven it is fulfilled by clear syghte in his godhede
/ For there shall none affecco^n be feled in a soul but godly and ghostly /

That the yefte of love among all other yeftes of Ihu^ is worthiest and most
profitable / And how Ihu^ does all that is well done in his lovers only for
love / And how love makyth the using of all virtues and all good deeds light
and easy / Caplm xxxvi.
Ask thou then of god no thing but this yeft of love that is the holy
ghost / For among all the yeftes yt our lord yeueth there is none so good
ne so profitable. so worthy ne so excellent as this is / For there is no yefte
of god that is both the yeuer and the yefte but this yefte of love / And
therefore it is the best and the worthyest / The yefte of prophecy the yeftes
of miracles worchyng. the yefte of the great knowing and cou^seylyng. and the
yefte of great fasting or of great penance doing: or any other such are
great yeftes of the holy ghost. but they are not the holy ghost / For a
reproved soul and a da^pnable might have all thise yeftes as has a chose^
soul / And therefore al these manner yeftes are not greatly for to desire ne
much for to charge / But the yefte of love is the holy ghost god himself. and
him may no soul have and be dampened with all / For that yefte saves it
only fro dampnaco^n: and makyth it goddis sone perceyuer of heavenly heritage /
And y^ love as I have before said is not the affecco^n of love that is formed
in a soul: but it is y^ holy ghost himself that is love vnfourmed that saves
a soul / For he yeueth himself to a soul first or the soul louith him / and
he fourmeth the affection in the soul: and makes the soul for to love him
on^li for himself / And not only that: but also by this yefte the soul loves
itself and all his eue^crysten as itself only for god / And this is the yefte
of love that makyth shedynge atwyx chosen souls and reproved / And this yefte
makyth full pees atwyxe god and a soul. and oonyth all blessed creatures holy
in god for it makith Ihu^ for to love us and us him also: and every each of us
for to love other in him / Coueyte this yefte of love pryncypally as I have
said / For if he woll of his grace give it the on that manner wise it shall open
and lyghte^ the reason of thy soul for to see sothfastnes that is god and
ghostly things / And it shall styre thyn affecco^n holy for to see
sothfastnes that is god and ghostly things / And it shall styre thyn affecion
holy and fully for to love him / And it shall worche in thy soul oonly as he
woll. and thou shall behold Ihu^ reverently with softnes of love and see how
he does / Thus byddeth he by his prophet that we should do saienge thus /
Vacate and vide^e (...) ego su^ deus / Cease ye and sees that I am god / That
is: ye yt are reformed in feeling and have your In^er eye opened in to syghte
of ghostly things cease ye some time of outward worching and see yt I am god
/ That is: See only how I Ihesu god and man do / Behold ye me for I do all /
I am love: and for love I do all that I do: and ye do naught / And that this
is sooth I shall show you / For there is no good deed done by you: ne good
thought felt in you: but if it be done through me / That is. Through might and
wisdom. and love myghtely: wyttely and lovely / Else it is no good deed /
But now is it soth that I Ihu^ am both might and wysdom and blessed love and
ye naught: for I am god / Then mow ye well see that I do all your good
deeds / And all good thoughts: and all your good loves in you: and ye do
right naught / And yet nevertheless ben all these good deeds called yours /
Not for ye worche hem pryncypally. but for I give he^ to you for love that I
have to you / And therefore sythe^ I yt am Ihu^. and for love does all this.
cease then^e ye of the beholdynge of yourself: and set yourself at naught and
look on me. and see that I am god. for I do all this / This is somewhat of the
meaning of the veers of dauyd before said / See then^e and behold what love
worcheth in a chosen soul that he refourmeth in feeling to his lyknes when the
reason is lyghtned a little to the ghostly knowing of Ihu^. and to the feeling
of his love / Then^e brings love in to the soul the full head of virtues.
and torneth hem al in to softnes and in to likynge as it were without worchynge
of the soul: for the soul stryueth not much for the getynge of hem as it
did before. but it has hem easily and felyth hem restfulfully only through
the yefte of love that is the holy ghost / And that is a well great comfort and
gladness unspeakable when it felyth suddenly and wot never how the virtue of
mekenes and patience sobertee and sadness chastyte and clennes louered to his
euencrysten. and all other virtues the which were to him sometime traueylous
paynfull and hard for to keep are now turned in to foftnes and likynge and in
to wondfull lightness: so ferforth that him thynkith no maystry ne no hardness
for to keep every virtue. but it is most liking to him for to keep it: and
all this makyth love / Other men that stonden in the comoetee of charity and
are not yet so ferforth in grace. but worche under the byddyng of reason they
stryuen and fyghten all day against sins for the getynge of virtues: and
sometime they be^ above and sometime byneth as wrastleers are / These men done
full well / They have virtues in reason and will. not in savor ne in love: for
they fyighten with hemself as it were by her own might for he^ / and therefore
may they not have full rest ne fully the hyer ho^de / Nevertheless they shall
have much mede: but they are not yet meke enough / They have not yet putt
he^self all fully in goddis hand: for they see him not yet / But a soul that
has ghostly syghte of Ihu^ takes no great keep of stryuynge for virtues for
that time / He is not besy abowte hem specially but he sets all his besynes
for to keep that syghte and that beholding of Ihu^ that it has for to hold
the mind stably thereto: and bind the love only to it yt it fall not therfro:
and forgete al other things asmoche as it may / And wha^ it does thus then^e
is Ihu^ sothfastly master again all sins: and bishado with it with his
blessed presence and getith it all virtues / And the soul is so comforted and
so borne up with the soft felyng of love that it has of the syghte of Ihu^
that it feleth no great disease outward / And thus sleeth love generally all
sins in a soul: and reformeth it in the new felynges of virtues /

How love through gracyous beholding of Ihu^ sleeth all ^^^rynges of pride: and
makes the soul for to lose savor and delight in all erthly worship / Caplm
xxxvii.
Nevertheless how love sleeth sins and refourmeth virtues in a soul more
specially shall I say. and first of pride and of mekenes that it contrary
virtue thereto / Thou sha^^ understand that there is two manner of mekenes / One
is ha^ by worchynge of reason / A another is felt of the special yefte of love
/ Both are of love: but that one love worcheth by reason of the soul. but
that other he worcheth by himself The first is imperfect: that other is
perfyte / The first mekenes that a man feleth of beholdynge of his ownes
sins and of his own wretchydnes through the which beholding he thinks
himself unworthy for to have any yefte of grace or any mede of god / But him
thinks it enough that he would of his great mercy grant him foryeuenesse of
his sins / And also he thinks him by cause of his own sins that he is
woors than the most sinner that lives / and that every man does better
thanne he / And so by such beholdynge thresteth he him self down in his
thought under all men / And he is besie for to ayenstonde the stirynges of
pride asmoche as he may both bodily pride and ghostly: and dispiseth himself
so that he assenteth not to the felinges of pride / And if his heart be taken
sometime with it that it be defoyled with vayn Joy of worship or of cu^nynge or
of praysynge or of any other thing / as soon as he may perceive it he is
evil paid with himself and has sorrow for it in heart and asks foryeuenes of
it of god. and shewyth him to his confessor* and accuses himself mekely. and
receives his penance / This is good mekenes. but it is not yet perfyte
mekenes. for it is of souls that are begyn^ynge and profitinge in grace caused
of beholdynge of sins / Love worchyth this mekenes by reason of the soul /
Perfyte mekenes a soul feleth of the syghte and the ghostly knowing of Ihu^ /
For when the holy ghost lyghtneth the reason in to the syghte of sothfastnesse
how Ihu^ is all and that he does all / the soul has so great love and so
great Joy in that ghostly syghte / for it is so sothfaste that it foryeteth
itself. and fully leneth to Ihu^ with all the love that it has for to behold
him / It takyth no keep of no unworthiness of itself ne of sins before done /
but settyth at naught itself with all the sins and all the good deeds that
ever it did. as if there were no thing but Ihu^ / Thus meke dauyd was when
he said thus / Et substa^cia mea ta^qm^ nichilu^ an^ te / That is: P^ ^ xxxviii.
Lord Ihu^ the syghte of thy blessed unmade substance and thyn endless being
shows well unto me that my substance and being of my soul is as naught
anence the / Also ane^ce his eue^crysten he has no reward to hem ne demynge
of hem whether they ben better or wors than himself is For he hold himself and
all other men as it were even ylike naught of he^self anence god* and that is
soth / For all the goodness yt is done in he^selfe or in hem is only of god
whom he beholds as al / And therefore sets he al other creatures at naught
as he does himself. Thus meke was the prophet when he said thus / Om^es
gentes quasi non sint sic sunt coram eo et quasi nichilu^ and mane reputate
su^t ei / Al men are before our lord as naught. Isay ^*
and as vnnotefull and naught they are acou^ted to him / That is anentes the
endless being and the vnchau^gable kind of god mankind is as naught / For of
naught it is made and to naught should it torn but if he kept it in the
being that made it of naught / This is sothfastnesse and this should make a
soul meke if it might see thorugh grace this sothfastnes / Therefore when love
opens the Inner eye of the soul for to see this sothfastnes with other
cyrcu^staunces that comen with all. then^e begyn^eth the soul for to be
sothfastly meke / For then^e by the syghte of god it felith and sees itself as
it is / And then forsakith the soul the beholdynge and the lenynge to
itself: and fully fallith to the beholdynge of Ihu^ / And when it does so.
then settith the soul naught by all the Joy and the worship of the world
/ For the Joy of worldly worship is so little and so naught in reward of
that Joy and that love that it felyth in the ghostly syghte of Ihu^ and
knowing of sothfastnes. that though it might have it without any sin he
would naught of it / Ne though men would worship him praise him and favor
him: or (...) him at great state it likyth him naught / Ne though he ha^
cu^nynge of all the vii. arts of clergy and of all crafts vnd the son^e: or
had power for to work al manner miracles. he has no more deinte of all this ne
more savor of he^ than to gnaw^ on a dry stycke / He had well lever foryete all this and for to be alone out of the sight of the world than for to think on
hem and be worshipped of al men / For ye heart of a true lover of Ihu^ is made
somoche and so large through a lytill syghte of him and a little feeling of his
ghostly love that all the likynge and all the Joy of all earth may not suffyce
for to fill a corner of it / And then^e semyth it well that these wretched
worldly lovers that are as it were rauysshed in love of her own worshypp^ /
and poursewe after it for to have it with all the might and all the wit that
they have / they have no savor in this mekenes / they are wonder far
therfro. But the lover of Ihu^ has this mekenes lastyngly. and that not with
heaviness and striuynge for it / but with likynge and gladness. the which
gladness it has not^ for it forsakyth the worship of the world / for that
were a proud mekenes that longs to an ypocryte / but for he has a syghte
and a ghostly knowing of sothfastnes and worthynes of Ihu^ through the yefte of
the holy ghost / That reuerente syghte and that lovely beholding of Ihesu
comfort the love so wonderfully and bears it up so myghtly and so softly
sothly that it may not like ne fully rest in no ne erthly Joy. ne it woll not
/ He makith none force wherther men lack him or praise him / worship him or
dispyse him as for himself / He settyth it not at heart neither for to be well
paid if men despise him as for more mekenes. ne for to be evil paid that men
should worship him or praise him / He had lever for to foryete both that one
and that other: and only think on Ihu^ and get mekenes by that way / And
that is much ye sykerer way who might come thereto / Thus did david wha^ he
said / Ocli mei semper ad dn^m qm^ ip^e euellet de laqueo pedes meos / That is:
P^ xiiii.
Mine eyes are ever open to Ihu^ our lord for why? he shall pluck my fete fro
snares of sin^es / For wha^ he does so then^e forsakyth he utterly himself
and vndcastyth him holy to Ihu^ / and then^e is he in a syker ward for the
sheelde of sothfastnes the which he holds kepyth him so well yt he shall
not be hurt through no stirynge of pride as long as he holds him within the
sheelde as the prophet says / Scuto circu^dabit te veritas eius non timebis a
timore nocturno. P^ x.
Sothfastnes shall vmbiclyppe the with a sheelde. and that is if thou al other
things left only behold him / For then^e shall thou not dread for ye
nyghtes dread / that is: thou shall not dread the spirit of pride whether he
come by night or by day. as the next veers says after thus / A sagitta
volante in die / Pride comyth by night for to assail a soul when it is
despised and repreued of other men that it should by that fall in heaviness and
in to sorrow / It comyth also as an arowe fleinge on ye day when a man is
worshypped and praised of al men. P. x.
whether it be for worldly doing or for ghostly that he should have vain Joy
in himself restyngly. and falls gladness in a passing thing / This is a
sharp arowe and a peryllous / It flees swyftly. and it stryketh softly. but
it wou^deth dedely / But the lover of Ihu^ that stabli beholds by devout
prayers and besy thinking on him is so vmbilapped with the syker sheelde of
sothfastnes that he dredeth not: for this arrowe may not enter in to the soul
/ Ne though it come it hurts not: but gleuteth away and passes forth / And
thus is the soul made meke as I understand by the worchynge of the holy
ghost. that is ye gift of love / For he opens the eye of the soul for to
see and love Ihesu / And he kepyth the soul in that syghte restfully and
sykerly / And he sleeth all the styrynges of pride wonderfully and pryuely and
softly: and the soul wot never how / And also he brings in by that way
sothfastly and lovely the virtue of meekness / All this does love. but not in
all his lovers (...) full / For some has this grace but shortly and lityll as
it (...) in the beginning of it. and a lityll assayenge toward. for the
conscience is not yet cleansed fully through grace / And so^^ have it more fully.
for they have clerer syghte of Ihesu. and they feel more of his love / And some
has it most fully. for they have the full yefte of conte^placo^on /
Nevertheless he that leest has on this manner as I have said. I hope sothly he
has the yeft of perfyte mekenes. for he has ye yeft of perfyte love

How love sleeth all stirynges of wrath and envy softly and refourmeth in the
soul the virtues of pees and patience and of perfyte charity to his
euencrysten as he did specially in the apposles / Caplm xxxviii.
Love worcheth wisely and softly in a soul there he woll for he sleeth
myghtily ire and envy and all passions of angrynes and malencolye in it^ and
brings in to the soul virtues of pacyence and myldenes peasibylite and
louered to his euencrysten / It is full hard and a great maystry to a man that
sto^deth only in worchynge of his own reason for to keep pacyence holy rest
and softnes in heart and charity to his euencrysten if they disease him
vnskylfully and done him wrong that he ne shall somewhat do again to hem through
stirynge of ire or of malencolye either in speaking or in worchynge or both /
And nevertheless though a man be styred and trowbled in himself and made
unrestful. be so that it be not to much passing over the bonds of reason.
and that he keep his hand and his tongue and be ready for to foryeue the
trespase wha^ mercy is asked / yet this man has the virtue of pacyence though
it be but weyke and nakidly. for asmoche as he would have it and traueyleth
besily in refreynynge of his unskillful passions yt he might have it / and
also is sorry yt he has it not as he should / But to a true lover of Ihu^ it is
no great maystry for to suffer all this / For why love fyghteth for him and
sleeth wonder softly such stirynges of wrath and of malencolye. and makyth
his soul so easy and so peasyble so suffryng and so goodly thorugh the
ghostly syghte of Ihesu with the feeling of his blessid love that though he be
despised and repreued of other men: or take wrong or harm shame or vylanye he
charge it not: he is not much styred ayenste him / He woll not be angered ne
styred against him / for if he were much styred he should forbere the comfort
that he felyth within his soul. but yt woll he not / He may lyghtlyer forgete
all the wrong that is done to him than a another man may foryeue it though
mercy were axed / And so he had well lever forgete it. for him thynkyth it
most ease to him / And love does all this. for love openyth the eye of the
soul to the sight of Ihesu. and stablith it with the liking of love that it
feleth by that syghte (...) comfort it so myghtly that it takes no keep
what (...) men Iangle or done against him / It hangs no thing (...) him / The

That is: The appostles yede Ioyeng (...) counseyle of the Jews when they were
beten with (...) and they were glad that they were worthi for to suffer (...)
bodyly disease for the love of Ihu^ / They were not styred (...) ire ne to
felnes to be avenged on the Jews that beten (...) a worldly man would be when

were not styred (...) no pride. ne to hines of he^selfe and to disdeyne: and
to demynge of the Jews as ypocrytes and heretykes are yt woll suffer much
bodily pain. and are sometime ready for to suffer death with great gladness and
with mighty will as it were in the name of Ihu^ for love of him / Sothly that
love and that gladness yt they have in suffryng of bodily myscheyf is not of the
holy ghost It comyth not fro the fire that bren^eth in the hye awter of heaven:
but it is feyned by the fend enfla^med of hell: for it is fully menged with
the heyght of pride and of presu^pcion of he^ self and despyte and demyuge and
disdeyne of hem that thus punissh^ hem / They wene that all this is charity.
and that they suffer al yt for the love of god: but they are begyled of the
myddaye fe^de A true lover of ihu^ wha^ he suffers harm of his eue^cristen is
so stre^ghthed through grace of the holy ghost. and is made so meke so
pacyente so peasyble. and that so sthofastly. yt what wrong or harm it be
that he sufffe of his euencristen he keeps ever mekenes / He dispiseth him
not: he demyth him not but he prays for him in his heart and has of him pity
and compassyon much more tendly than of a another man that never did him harm
/ And sothly better loves him and more fervently desires the saluaco^n of his
soule^ by cause that he sees yt he shall have so much ghostly profit of the
evil deed of that other man though it be against his will / But this love and
this mekenes worcheth oonly the holy ghost above the kind of man in hem that
he makes the true lovers of Ihu^ /

How love sleeth couetyse lecherye and glotenye. and sleeth ye flesshly savor
and delight in all the v. bodily wits softly and easily through a gracyous
beholding of Ihu^ / Caplm xxxix.
COuetyse also is slain in a soul by the worchynge of love: for it makyth the
soul so coueytous of ghostly good and to heavenly riches so ardau^t that it
sets right nough tby all erthly things / It has no more deynte in having
of a precious stone thanne a chalk stone / ne more love has he in a hundredth
pound of gold thanne in a pound of leed / It sets all thing that shall
perysshe at one price / No more he charge that one than that other as in his
love / For it semith well that all thise erthly things that worldly men let
so great price of and love so deyntly should pass away and torn to naught
both the thing in itself and the love of it / And therefore he brings it in
his thought by time in to that plighte that it shall be after: and so
acou^teth it as naught / And when wordly lovers stryuen and fyghten. and plede
for erthly good who may first have it: the lover of Ihu^ stryueth with no
man but kepyth himself in pees. and holds him paid with that yt he has and
wol stryne for no more / For him thynkyth yt he needs no more of all the riches
in earth than a skant bodily sustenau^ce for to save the bodily life with all
aslo^ge as god woll. and that he may lightly have / And therefore wol he no
more than skantly him needs for the time that he may freely be discharged fro
besynes about the keeping and the dispe^dyng of it. and fully give his heart
and his besynes about the seeking of Ihu^ for to find him in clen^es of
spirit: for that to all his couetyse? For why: oonly clean of heart shall see
him Also flesshly love of fader and mother and other worldly friends ha^geth not
upon him / It is even kutte fro his heart with the sword of ghostly love that
he has no more affeccio^ to f^der or mother or to any worldly friend than he
has to a another man. but if he see or feel in hem more grace or more virtue
than in other men / Out take this: that his fader and his mother had the self
grace yt some other me^ have / But nevertheless if they ben not so: then^e
loves he other men better than hem: that is charity / And so sleeth goddis
love couetyse of ye world. and brings in to the soul pouerte in spirit /
And yt does love not only in hem that have right naught of worldly good but
also in some creatures that are in great worldly state and have dispendynge of
erthly riches / Love sleeth in some of hem couetise so ferforth yt they have no
more likinge ne savor in having of hem than of a straw / Ne though they be
lost for defawte of hem that should keep hem they set naught thereby? For why
the heart of goddis lover is through the yefte of ye holy ghost taken so fully
with the syghte of the love of a another thing that is Ihu^. and that is so
precious and so worthy yt it wol receive none other love restyngly that is
contrary thereto / And not only does love this but also it sleeth the lykyng
of lecherye and all other bodily vnclen^es. and brings in to the soul very
chastyte^ and torneth it in to likynge / For the soul felyth so great delight
in the syghte of Ihu^ that it likes for to be chaste and is no great hardness
to it for to keep chastity. for it is so most ease and most rest / And upon
the self wise the yefte of love sleeth lusts of glotenye and makyth the soul
sobre and temperaunte. and bears it up so myghtily that it may not rest in
likynge of mete and drink. but it takes mete and drink what it be that leest
greueth the bodyly complexion if he may lightly come thereto / Not for love of
itself. but for the love of god / On this manner wise the lover of god sees
well yt him needs for to keep his bodily life with mete and drink aslong as
god woll suffer hem to be together / Then^e shall this be ye discreco^n of the
lover of Ihu^ as I vndstonde that has feling and worchynge in the love. that
upon what manner that he may most keep his grace hole and leest be let fro
worchynge in it through taking of bodily sustenau^ce: so shall he do / That
manner of mete that leest lets and leest troubles the heart and may keep
the body in strength be it flesh be it fysshe be it bread and ale: yt I trow
the soul cheseth for to hane if it may come thereby / For all the besynes of ye
soul is for to think on Ihu^ with reverent love ever without lettynge of any
thing if yt it might / And therefore sythen it must nedis so^what be let
and hyndred. the less that it is let and hindered by mete or drink or any
other thing the lever it is / It had lever use the best mete and most of
price vnd the son^e if it less let ye keeping of his heart than for to take
but bread and warter if yt let him more / For he has no reward for to
get him great mede for the pain of fasting. and be put thereby fro softnes in
heart: but all his besynes is for to keep his heart as stably as he may in the
syghte of Ihu^ and in the feeling of his love / And sothly as I trow he might
with less likynge use ye best mete that is good in the own kind than a
another man that worcheth al in reason without the special yefte of love should
mow use the worste. out take mete that through craft of curyosite is only
made for lust / That manner of mete may he not well acorde with all / And also
on that other side if little mete as only bread and ale most helps and
ceseth his heart and kepyth it most in pees it is most leyf than to him for
to use it so: and namly if he feel bodily strength only of the yefte of love
with all / And yet does love more for it sleeth accidye and flesshly ydlenes.
and makes the soul to be occupied in goodness and namly Inward in beholdynge
of him. by the (...) of which the soul has savor and ghostly delight in
prayeng^ in thynkyng and in all other manner of doing that needs (...) be done
after the state that he is in without heaviness or pay^^ful bytternes whether he
be religious or seculer / Also it (...) the vain likynge of the v. bodily
wits / For the sight (...) eye: that the soul has no liking in the syghte
of any (...) thing. but it feleth rather pain and disease in beholding of it
be it never so fair. never so precious never so (...) And therefore as worldly
lovers ren^e out sometime for to (...) new things for to wond on hem: and so
for to feed her heart with the vain sight of hem / Right so a lover of Ihu^ is
besy for to ren^e away and wythdrawe him fro the syghte of such manner things
that the Inner syghte be not let / for he sees ghostly a another manner
thing yt is fayrer and more wondful and that would he not forbere / Right on
the self wise is it of spekyng and heryng / It is a pain to ye soul of a
lover of thu^ for to speak or here any thing that might let the fredom of
his heart for to think on Ihu^. what song or melodye or mynstralsie outward
that it be if it let the thought that it may not freely and restfully pray
or think on him. it likyth him right naught / And the more delectable that it
is to other me^ the more unsavory it is to him / And also for to here any manner
of spekyng of other men but it be so^what towchyng the worchynge of his soul
in the love of Ihu^: it likyth him right naught: he is else right sone weary
thereof / He had well lever be in pees and here right nout. ne speak right
naught tha^ for to here the speaking and the techyng of the grettest clerk of
earth with all the reasons that he can say to him through man's wits. but if
he can speak felyngly and stiryngly of ye love of Ihu^ for that is his craft
pryncipally / And therefore would he not else speak: here ne see but that
might help him and ferder him in to more knowing. and to better feeling of
him / Of worldly speech it is no dowte that he has no savor in spekyng ne
in herynge of it: ne in worldly tales ne in tidinges. ne in none such vain
Iangelynge. that longs not to him / And so it is of smelling and sauerynge
/ The more that the thought should be distracte and broken fro ghostly rest
by ye use either of smelling or sauerynge. or of any of the bodily wits the
more he flees it / The less that he feleth of hem the lever is him / And if
he might live in the body without ye felyng of any of he^ he would never feel
hem / For they trouble the hrete often times / and puttith it fro rest. and they
may not fully be eschewed Nevertheless the love of Ihu^ is sometime so mighty in
a soul that it ouercomith and sleeth all that is contrary thereto for a time /

What virtues and graces a soul receives through opening of ye In^er eye in
to ye gracyous beholding of Ihu^. and how it may not begete only through
man's traueyle. but through special grace and traueyle also / Caplm xl.
THus worcheth love in a soul openyng the ghostly eye in to beholdyyge of Ihu^
by Inspyraco^n of special grace^ and makyth it clean subtle and able to the
work of conte^placyon / what this opening of the ghostly eye is the gretteste
clerk in earth can not ymagyn by his wytt ne show fully by his tongue / For it
may not be get by study ne through man^es traueyle only: but pryncipally by
grace of the holy ghost and with traueyle of man / I dread much to speak out
of it for me thi^keth I can not / I passes mine assaye and my lyppes are
unclean Nevertheless for I hope love axeth and love biddyth: therefore I shall
say a lityl more of it as I hope love techeth / This opening of the ghostly
eye is that lighty derkenes and rich naught that I spoke of before. and it
may be called puryte of spyryte and ghostly rest: Inward stylnes and pees of
conscience: hyghnes of thought and on^lynes of soul: a lyfly feeling of grace
and pryuyte of heart. the waker sleep of the spouse and taastynge of heavenly
savor. bren^yng in love and shynyn^ge in light. enter of co^te^placyon. and
refourmyng in feeling / All thise reasons are said in holy writing by diverse
men. for every of hem spoke of it after his feeling in grace / And though all
thise ben (...) in showing of words: nevertheless they are all in one (...) of
sothfastnes / For a soul that through vysitynge of (...) has one. has all?
For why: a sighyng soul to see the face (...) Ihu^ when it is towched through
special grace of the holy g^^ost it is sodeinly changed and turned fro the
plyte that it was (...) to a another manner of feeling / It is wondfully departed
and (...) first in to itself fro the love and the likyng of al erthly thing
somoche that it has lost the savor of the bodily life and of all thing that
is saaf only Ihu^ / And then^e it is clean fro al ye fylthe of syn^e: so
ferforth that the mind of it and al vnordeynde affection of any creature is
suddenly wasshen and wyped away. that there is no mean lettynge betwyxe Ihu^
and the soul but only the bodily life: and then^e it is in ghostly rest? For
why all paynfull doubts and dredes and all other temptacyous of ghostly enmyes
are driven out of the heart that they trowble not ne synke not therein for the
time / It is in rest fro the noye of wordly business and paynful taryenges of
wicked stirynges. but it is full besye in the fre ghostly worchyng of love /
And the more it traueyleth so. the more rest he feleth This restfull
traueylle is full far fro flesshly ydlenes and fro blind sykernes / It is
full of ghostly work. but it is callid rest. for grace loses the heavy yocke
of flesshly love fro the soul and makyth it mighty and free through the yefte
of ghostly love for to worche gladly softly and delectably in all thing that
grace styreth it for to worche in / And therefore it is called an holy ydlenes
and a rest most besye. and so it is in Inward stylnes fro the great cryenge
of the bestly noise of flesshly desires and unclean thoughts / This stylnes
makyth Inspyraco^n of the holy ghost in beholdynge of Ihu^ /? For why: His
voyse is so sweet and so mighty that it puts scylence in a soul to
Ianglyng of all other spekers^ for it is a voys of virtue softly sowned in a
clean soul. of the which the prophet says thus / Vox dn^i in virtute / That
is: The voys of our lord Ihesu is in virtue / This voys is a lyfely word and a
spedy as the apostle says / Viuus est sermo dei and efficax et penetrabilior
om^i gladio / that is. quycke is the word of Ihu^ and spedy. more perisshynge
than any sword is / Through speaking of this word is flesshly love slain and
the soul kept in scylence fro all wicked stirynges / Of this scilence it is
said in the apocalips thus / Apoc^
Factu^ est scilenciu^ in celo quasi dimidia hora / Scilence was made in heaven
as it were an half hour / Heaven is a clean soul through grace lift up fro
erthly love to heavenly co^uersaco^n and so it is in scylence / But for as
much as that scylence may not last hoole contynually for corrupcyon of the
bodily kind / Therefore it is lyckened to the time of half an hour / A full
short time the soul thinks that it is be it never so long / And therefore
it is but an half hour / And then has it pees in conscience? For why:
Grace puttyth out gnawynge pryckynge and stryuynge and flyghtynge of sins /
And brings in pees and accord. and makyth Jesus and a soul both one in full
acordaunce of will /

There is none vpbradynge of sins: ne sharp repreuynge of defawtes made that
time in a soul For they have kyssed and made friends: and all is forgyuen that
was mysse done Thus felyth the soul then with full meke sikernesse and great
ghostly gladness / And conceyueth a full great boldness of salvation by this
accord making / For it heryth a preuy wytnessynge in conscience of the holy
ghost that he is a chosen sone to heavenly heritage / Thus saint poul says /
Ip^e spiritus testimonium perhibet spiritui nostro quonia^ filii dei sumus /
That is: The holy ghost beryth witness to our spiry^te that we are goddis
sons / This wytnessynge of conscyen^ce sothfastly felt through grace is the
very Joy of the soul as the apostle says / Gloria mea est testimonium
conscienc^^ me / That is: My Joy is the witness of my conscye^ce (...) that
is when it wytnessyth pees and acorde true love and fre^dshyppe betwyxe Ihesu
and a soul / And when it is in th^^ pees: then is it in hyghnes of thought
/

When the soul is bounden with love of the world then^e (...) it byneth all
creatures / For every thing ouergooth it and ^^ryth it down by maystry that
it may not see Ihesu ne (...) him / For right as the love of the world is
vain and flesshly Rygh so the beholdynge and thynkynge^ and the using of all
creatures is flesshly / And that is a thraldom of the soul But then through
opening of the ghostly eye in to Ihesu the love is turned / And the soul is
raised up after his own kind above all bodyly creatures /

And then the beholdynge and thinking and the using of hem is ghostly / For
the love is ghostly / The soul has then full great disdeyne for to be buxom
to love of worldly things. for it is high set above he^ through grace / It
sets naught by all ye world? for why: all shall pass and perissh^ / Unto
this hienes of heart while the soul is kept therein comith none error ne
deceyte of the fe^de: for Ihu^ is sothfastly in syghte of the soul that time
and all thing byneth him / Of this ye prophet spekyth thus / Accedat ho^ ad
cor altu^ et exaltabit deus Come man to high heart and god shall be hyghed /
P. lxiii.
That is: a man yt through grace comyth to the highness of thought shall see
that Ihu^ is only hyghed above all creatures. and he in him / And then^e is
the soul above much strau^ged fro felyship of worldly lovers / Though her
body be in mids among hem. full far ben they departed fro flesshly
affecco^ns of creatures It charge not though it never see man ne speak with
him ne have comfort of him if it might ever be so in that ghostly feeling /
It felyth so great homlynes of the blessed presence of our lord Ihu^ and
somoche savor of him that it may lightly for his love foryete the flesshly
affeccio^ and the flesshly mind of all creatures / I say not that it shall
not love ne think of other creatures. but I say that it shall think on hem in
time and see hem and love hem ghostly and freely. not flesshely and painfully
as it did before / Oseerii
Of this on^lynes speaks the prophet thus / Duca^ ea^ in solitudine. et
loquar ad cor eius / I shall led her in to only stead. and I shall speak to her
heart / That is: Grace of Ihu^ ledeth a soul fro noyous company of flesshly
desires in to on^lynes of thought. and makyth it foryete the liking of the
world and sowneth by swetnes of his Inspyracyon words of love in eeres of the
heart / Oonly is a soul when it loves Ihu^ and tentyth fully to him. and has
lost the savor and the comfort of the world / And that it might better
keep this only nes it flees the company of all men if it may. and sechyth
on^lynes of body: for that much helps to on^lynes of y^ soul and to the
free worchynge of love / The less lettynge that it has without of vain
Jangling or within of vayn thinking the more free it is in ghostly
beholdynge: and so it is in pryuytee of heart / All without is a soul whiles
it is ouerlayed and blinded with worldly love / It is as comen as the hye way.
for every stirynge that comes of the flessh^ or of the fe^de synketh in and
gooth thorugh it / But then through grace it is drawn in to the preuy chamber
in to the syghte of our lord Ihu^. and hereth his preuy counseyle: and is
wonderfully comforted in the herynge / Of this spekith the prophet thus
Secretu^ meum michi^ secretum meu^ michi / My preuytee to me. my preuyte to me
/ That is: The lover of Ihu^ through Inspyraco^n of grace taken up fro outward
feeling of worldly love and rauysshed in to the preuite of ghostly love yeldeth
than king to him saying thus / My pryuete to me: That is* My lord Ihu^ thy
preuyte is showed to me and preuyly hid fr^ all lovers of the world / For it
is called hid manna. yt may lightlyer be asked than told what it is / And
that our lord Jesus behoteth to his lover saying thus / Dabo sibi manna ab^
conditu^ quod nemo nouit nisi qui accipit / That is: I shall give manna hid
that no man knows but he that takith ^ This manna is heavenly mete and angels
fode as holy write says / For angels are fully fed and filled with clear
syghte in brennynge love of our lord Ihesu. and that is manna / For we mow
ask what it is: but not wit what it is But the lover of Ihesu is not filled
yet here: but he is fed (...) by a little taastynge of it whiles he is bounden
in this bodyly life /

This tastynge of this manna is a lyfly feeling of grace had through opening of
the ghostly eye / And this grace is not an other grace that a chosen soul
felith in the beginning of his co^uersyon: but it is the same and the self
grace. but it is otherwise felt and showed to a soul / For why grace wexeth
with ye soul and the soul wexeth with grace / And the more clean ye the soul
is far departed fro the love of the world the more mighty is the grace: more
Inward and more ghostly showing in the presence of our lord Ihu^: so yt the
same grace yt torneth hem first fro syn^e: and makith hem begyn^ynge and
profityng by yeftes of virtue and exercise of good works maken he^ also
perfyte / And that grace is called a lyfly feeling of grace: for he yt has it
feleth it well. and knows well by experye^ce that he is in grace / It is full
lyfly to him for it quyckneth the soul wondfully and makyth it so hole that
it feleth no paynfull disease of the body though it be feeble and sykly? For
why: then^e is ye body mightiest most hole and most restful and the soul
also: with out this grace the soul can not live but in pain: for it thynkyih
yt it might ever keep it and no thing should put it away And nevertheless yet
it is not so. for it passes away full lightly / But nevertheless though the
souereyne felinge passes a way and wythdrawe. the releif leueth still and
keeps the soul in sadness. and makith it for to desire the coming again / And
this is also the waker sleep of the spouse: of y^ which holy writ says thus
/ Ego dormio et cor meu^ vigilat / I sleep and my heart wakith / That is: Cant.
v
I sleep ghostly when through grace the love of the world is slain in me and
wicked stirynges of flesshly desires are deed: somoche that uneaths I feel he^
/ I am not tarried with hem: my heart is made free / And then^e it wakith. for
it is sharp and ready for to love Ihu^ and see him / The more I sleep fro
outward things the more waker I am in knowing of Ihu^ and of Inward things
/ I may not wake to Ihu^ but if I sleep to the world / And therefore the grace
of the holy ghost speryng the flesshly eye does ye soul selpe fro worldly
vanyte: and opening the ghostly eye wakith in to the syghte of god dis mageste
helid vnd the cloud of his precious manhede As the gospel says of the
apostles when they were with our lord Ihu^ in his transfyguraco^n / First
they slepte / Et euigilantes videru^t magestate^ / They waking saw his
mageste By sleep of the apostles is understand deyeng of worldly love through
Inspiraco^n of the holy ghost. by her walking conte^placo^n of Ihu^ / Through
this sleep the soul is brought in to rest fro noise of flesshly lust / And
through walkinge it is raised up in to the syghte of Ihu^ and ghostly things /
The more that the eyes are spered in this manner sleep fro the appetyte of
erthly thing. the sharper is the Inner syghte in lovely beholdynge of heavenly
fayrhede / This slepynge and this wakyng love worcheth through the light of
grace in the soul of the lover of our lord Ihesu /

How special grace in beholdynge of our lord Ihu^ wythdrawyth sometime fro a
soul / And how a soul shall have her in the absence and presence of Ihu^ /
And how a soul shall desire that in it is always the gracyous presence of
Ihesu / Caplm xli.
Show me then^e a soul that through Inspyraco^n of grace has opening of the
gostly syghte in to beholdynge of Ihu^ that is departed and drawn out fro the
love of the world so ferforth that it has puryte and pouerte of spirit:
ghosty ^^ste: Inward scylence. and pees in conscye^ce: highness of thought^
on^lynes and pryuete of heart: waker sleep of the spouse. that hat^ lost
liking and Joys of the world. taken with delyce of heu^^ly sauour^ ever
thristynge: and softly shyghynge yt blessed presen^ce of Ihu^. and I dare
hardly pronounce that this soul bren^eth all in love and shyneth in ghostly
light worthy for to come to the name and to the worship of the spowse. for it
is refourme^ in feeling made able and ready to contemplacion / These are the
tokens of Inspiraco^n in openyng of the ghostly eye? For why when the eye is
opened the soul is in full feeling of all these virtues before said for that
time / Nevertheless it falls often times that grace withdrawyth in party
for corrupcyon of man's freelte and suffers then^e the soul for to fall in
to itself in flesshlyhede as it was beforne / And then is the soul in pain
and in sorrow: for it is blind and unsavory and can no good / It is weyke and
vnmyghty enco^bred with ye body and with all the bodily wits / It secheth and
desires after ye grace of Ihu^ again and it may not find it / For holy writ
says of our lord thus / Postqm^ vultu^ suu^ absco^derit no^ e^ qui
co^te^plet eu^ / That is: After wha^ our lord Ihu^ has hid his face there
is none that may behold him. wha^ he shows him the soul may not vnsee
him. for he is light. and when he hydeth him it may not see him for the soul
is derke / His hidynge is but a subtle assayenge of the soul / His showing
is a wond merciful goodness in comfort of the soul / Have ye no wond though
the feeling of grace be wythdrawe sometime fro a lover of Ihu^ / For holy wrytt
says ye same of the spouse that she fares thus / Quesiui et no^ inueni illu^.
vocaui and no^ respondit michi / I seched and I found him not / I called and
he answered not / That is: Cant. 3
when I fall down to my freelte then^e grace wythdraweth* for my falling is
cause thereof. and not his fleenge / But then^e feel I pain of my wretchidnes
in his absence / And therefore I sought him by great desire of heart: and he
yaue to me no feable answering / And then^e I cried with all my soul / Cant:
6
Reuertere dilecte mi / Torn aye^ thou my loved And yet it semid as he herd
me not / The paynfull felyng of myself and the assaylinge of flesshly loves and
dredes in this time and the wantynge of my ghostly strength is a co^tynuell
cryeng of my soul to Ihu^ / And nevertheless our lord makith strange and
comyth not cry I never so fast / For he is syker ynouh^ of his lover that he
wol not torn again to worldly love fully he may no savor have therein. and
therefore abides he y^ longer But at ye last when he woll he comyth again full
of grace and of sothfastnes. and vysiteth the soul yt languyssheth in desire
by syghe^ges of love to his presence. and towchyth it and anoynteth it full
softly with the oil of gladnes^ and makyth it suddenly hole fro all pyne: and
then^e cries the soul to Ihu^ in ghostly voys with a glad heart thus /
Oleum effusu^ nomen tuum Oil yshedde is thy name / Thy name is Ihesu: Cant. i.
that is hele / Then as long as I feel my soul sore and syke for sin
pyned with the heavy burden of my body sorry and dredynge for perils and
wretchydnes of this life. so long lord Ihesu thy name is oil speryd not
oil yshed to me / But when I feel my soul suddenly towched with the light of
thy grace heled and softed fro all the fylthe of sin. and comforted in love
and in light with ghostly strength and gladness unspeakable. then may I
say with lusty loving and ghostly might to the / Oil yshed is thy name Ihu^
to me / For by the effect of thy gracyous vysitynge I feel well of thy name ye
true expownynge that thou art Ihesu heel / For oonly thy gracyous presence
helith me fro sorrow and fro sin / Blessed is that soul that is ever fed
in feeling of love in his presence. or is borne up by desire to him in his
absence / A wise lover is he and well taught that sadly and reverently has
him in his presence. and lovely beholds him without dyssolute lyghtnes. and
pacyently and easily beryth him in his absence without venemo^^ dispeyre and
over pyneful bytternesse / This chau^gabilyte o^ absence and presence of Ihu^
that a soul felyth is not perfec^^cyon of the soul: ne it is not ayenste the
grace of perfecco^n (...) of contemplacyon: but in so much perfeccyon is the
(...) For the more lettynge that a soul has of itself fro conty^nuell feeling
of grace the less is the grace: and yet neuerthe^les is the grace in itself
grace of conte^placo^n. This chau^g^^^^lyte of absence and presence falls as
well in the state of ^^^feccio^ as in state of begin^yng: but in a another
manner. for ri^^ as there is dyuersyte of feeling in the presence of grace
bytwix thise two states. right so is there in the absence of grace / And
therefore he that knows not the absence of grace is ready to be dysceyued / And
he that kepyth not the presence of grace. is unkind to the vysitynge: whether
he be in state of begyn^ers or perfect Nevertheless the more stablenes that
there is in grace unhurt and unbroken the louelyer is the soul and more like
unto him in whom is no chau^gabilyte as the apostles say the / And it is full
semely that the spouse be like to Ihu^ spouse in manners and in virtues full
acordynge to him in stablynes of perfyte love / But that falls seeldom now
here but in ye special spouse / For he that perceyueth no chau^gabylyte in
feeling of his grace but ylike hole and stable unbroken and unhurt as him
thinks. he is either full perfyte or full blind / He is perfyte that is
sequestyrde fro all flesshly affecco^ns and comonyng of all creatures: and all
means are broken away of corrupco^n and of syn^e betwyx Ihu^ and his soul
fully oonyd to him with softnes of love / But this is only grace above mannis
kind He is full blind that feyneth him in grace without ghostly feeling of
goddis Inspyraco^n: and sets himself in a manner of stablynes as he were
ever in felyng and in worchynge of special grace: demyng that al is grace that
he does and felith with out and within. thynkyng that what so ever he do or
speak is grace: holding himself vnchau^gable in specyalte of grace / If there
be any such as I hope there be none: he is full blind in feeling of grace /
But then^e might thou say thus that we should live only in truth. and not
coueyte ghostly felynges ne reward hem if they come / For the apostle says /
Iustus ex fide viuit / That is: The rightwysman lives in truth / Unto this I
say that bodily felynges ben they never so comfortable we shall not coueyte ne
reward much if they come But ghostly felynges such as I speak of if they
come in ye manner as I have said before we should ever desire: Heb^. x.
that are sleenge of all worldly love opening of the ghostly eye: puryte of
spirit: pees of conscience: and all other before said / We should coueyte to
feel ever the lyfly Inspyracyon of grace made by the ghostly presence of Ihesu
in our soul if that we might. and for to have him in our syghte with
reverence. and ever feel the swetnes of his love by a wondfull homlynes of his
presence / This should be our life and our felyng in grace after the mesure of
his yefte in whom all grace is. to some more and to some less / For his
presence is feled in diverse manner wise as he wouchith saaf / And in this we
should live and worche that longs to us to worche. for without this we should
not cu^ne live / For right as the soul is the life of the body. righ so is
Ihu^ the life of the soul by his gracyous presence And nevertheless this manner
feeling be it never so much it is yet but troth as in reward of that yt
shall be of theself Jesus in the bliss of heaven / Lo this feeling should we
desire. for eueryche a soul reasonable owyth for to coueyte with all the
myghtes of it nyghynge to Ihu^ and oonynge to him through feeling of his
gracyous vnseable presence / How that presence is feled it may better be
known by experyence than by any writing. for it is the life and the love: the
might and the light / the Joy and the rest of a chose^ soul / And therefore
he that has oues sothfastly feled it he may not forbere it without pain he
may not vndesyre it it is so good in itself and so comfortable / what is
more comfortable to a soul here than for to be draw out through grace fro the
vile noye of worldly business and fylth of desires and fro vain affecco^n of
all creatures in to rest and softnes of ghostly love pryuely perceyuyng y^
gracious presence of Ihu^ felably fed with savor of his vnseable blessed
face: Sothly no thing me thinks / No thing may make the soul of a lover
full of myrthe but the gracyous presence of Ihu^ as he can show him to a clean
soul / He is never heavy ne sorry but wha^ he is with himself in flesshlynes /
He is never full glad ne merry but when he is out of himself as he was with
Ihu^ in his ghostlynes / And yet is that no full myrthe. for ever there
hangs an heavy lu^pe of bodily corrupco^n on his soul: and bears it down
and much lets ye ghostly gladness. and yt must ever be whiles it is here in
this life. but nevertheless for I speak of chau^gabilyte of grace how it comyth
and gooth that y^ mystake it not^ therefore I mean not of the common grace that
is had and felt in troth and in good will to god without the which having
and lasting therein no man may be saaf: for it is in the leest chose^ soul
that lives. but I mean of special grace felt by Inspiraco^n of ye holy
ghost in the manner as it is before said / The comen grace that is charity
lasts hole what so ever a man do aslonge as his will and his ente^te is
true to god without the which having and lasting that he would not syn^e
dedely. ne the deed yt he wylfully does is not forbede as for dedely sin /
For this grace is not lost but for dedely sin^e / And then^e it is dedely sin^e
when his conscience witnesses with a vysement that it is dedely syn^e. and yet
nevertheless he does it^ or else his conscience is so blinded that he holds
it no dedely syn^e all though he do the deed wylfully y^ which is forbode of
god and holy church as dedely sin / Special grace felt through the vnseable
presence of Ihu^ that makyth a soul a perfyte lover lastith not ever ylike
hole in the hynes of felyng. but chau^gably comith and gooth as I have said
before / Thus our lord says / Spu^s vbi vult spirat et vocem eius audis and
nescis vnde veniat aut quo vadat / (...). 3
The holy ghost spyreth where he woll and thou herest his voys but thou wost
not when he comyth ne^ whether he gooth / He comyth pryuely some time when thou
art leest waar of him: but thou shall well know him or you goo / For wondfully
he stiryth and myghtily torneth thin heart in to beholding of his godenes. and
does thyn heart melte delectably as wax ayenste the fire in to softnes of his
love. and this is the voys that he sowneth / But then he gooth or thou wot
it for he withdrawith him so^what / naught in all: but fro excess in to
sobirte. The hines passes: but the substance and theffecte of grace dwells
stylle / And that is aslonge as the soul of a lover kepith him clean: and
falls not wylfully to recheleshede or dissolucyon is flesshlynes ne to
outward vanyte. as some time it does though it have no delight therein for
freeltee of it self / Of this chau^gabylite in grace speak I of now /

A co^mendaco^n of prayer offered to Ihu^ of a soul contemplatyfe / And how
stablynes in prayer is a syker work to sto^de in / And how every felinge of
grace in a chosen soul may be said Ihu^: but the more clenner the soul is ye
worthyer is the grace / Caplm xlii.
THe soul of a man while it is not towched with special grace is blunte and
boystous to ghostly work and can naught thereon / It may not thereof for
weyknes of itself / It is both old and dry. undevout and unsavory in
itself / But then^e comyth the light of grace^ and through towchyng makyth it
sharp and subtyl ready and able to ghosty work: and yeueth it a great fredom
and an hole redynes in will for to be buxom to all the stirynge of grace ready
for to worche after that grace styreth ye soul / For by opening of the
ghostly eye it is applied all fully to grace ready to pray / And how the soul
prays then^e shall I tell the / The most special prayer that the soul
uses and has most comfort in I hope is the Pater noster^ or else psalms
of the sawter / The pater noster for lewd men. and psalms and ympnes and
other service of holy church for lettred / The soul prays then^e not in
manner as it did before in common manner of me^ by hyghnes of voys: or by renable
speaking out. but in full great stylnesse of voys and softness of heart For
why. his mind is not trowbled ne tarried with outward things but hole gadred
togider in itself / And the soul is set as it were in a ghostly presence of
Ihu^ and therefore every word and every syllable is sowned sauerly sweet and
delectably with full accord of mouth and of heart? For why the soul is
turned then^e all in to fire of love / And therefore every word that it pryuely
prays is like to a spercle spryngyng out of a fire bronde yt chaffith all ye
myghtes of the soul and torneth he^ in to loue^ and lyghtneth hem so
comfortably that the soul list ever for to pray and do none other thing /
The more it prays the better it may the myghtyer it is. for grace helps the
soul well. and makyth all thing light and easy. that it list right well to
psalm and sing the louynges of god with goostly myrthe in heavenly delight /
This ghostly work is fode of the soul. and this prayer is of much virtue /
For it wastes and brings to naught al temptaco^ns of the fend preuy and
aperte. it sleeth all the mind and the likyng of the world. and of flesshly
sins. It bears up the body and the soul fro paynfull telynge of
wretchydnesse of this life / It kepyth the soul in feeling of grace and
worchynge of love: and nourysshe it ever ylyke hot and fresshe as styckes
norissheth fire / It puttyth away all yrkynge and heaviness of heart* and
holds it in might and in ghostly gladness / Of this prayer spekyth dauyd
thus / Dirigatur oracio mea sicut incensu^ in conspectu tuo / That is: Dressed
be my prayer lord as encense in thy syghte / For right as encense that is cast
in the fire makyth sweet smelle by the reke styghyng up to the air / right so
a psalm sauourly and softly song of said in a bren^ynge heart yeuyth up a
sweet smelle to the face of our lord Ihu^: and to all the court of heaven /
There dare no flesh fly rest upon the pottes brynke boylynge on the fire /
Right so may there no flesshly delight rest upon a clean soul that is happed
and warmed al in the fire of love boylynge and blowynge psalms and louynges to
Ihesu / This prayer is ever herd of Ihesu / It yeldyth grace to Ihesu / And
receives grace again / It makyth a soul homely and felowly with Ihesu^ and
with all the angels of heaven / Use it who so may / The work is good and
gracious in itself / And though it be not al fully contemplaco^n. in itself
ne the werkynge of love by itself. Nevertheless it is a party of
contemplacyon? For why: It may not be done on this manner wise but in plentee

of grace through opening of the ghostly eye / And therefore a soul that has
this fredom and this gracyous feeling in prayenge with ghostly savor and
heavenly delight has the grace of conte^placyon in manner as it is / This prayer
is a rich offrynge filled all in fatnes of devotion: received by angels and
presented to the face of Ihu^ / The prayer of other men that are besy in actyf
works is made of two words. for they often times fourmeth in her hertes one
word through thynkyng of worldly be synes. and sownen in her mouth a another
word of the psalm song or said / And not for that. if her entente be true
yet is her prayer good and medefull though it lack sauoure and swetnes / But
this manner of a man conte^platyfe is made but of one word. for as it is
fourmed in the heart right so holy it sowneth in the mouth. as it were
naught but one thing yt fourmyth and sowneth / And sothly no more it is / For
the soul through grace is made hole in itself so far departed fro the
flesshlyhede that it is master of the body^ and then^e is the body naught
else but as an Instrumente and a trompe of the soul in the which the soul
blowith sweet notes of ghostly loui^ges to Ihu^ / This is the trompe that Dauyd
spoke of thus* Buccinate in neomenia tuba in insigni die sole^pnitatis ^^stre /
Blow ye with a trompe in the new moan / That is ye souls that are reformed
in ghostly life through openyng of the Inner eye. blow ye devoutly sownynge
psalms with ye trompe of your bodily tongue / And therefore for this pray^^ is
plesau^te to Ihu^ and so profitable to the soul: then^e it is good to him
that is new turned to god what that he be yt w^^de pleyse him. and coueyteth
to have some queynt feeling of grace for to coueyte this felynge^ that he might
through grace come to this lyberte of spirit. and offer his prayers and his
psalms to Ihu^ co^tynuelly: and stably and devoutly with hole mind and
brennynge affecco^n in him to have it nere hand in custom when grace woll
styre him thereto / This is a syker feeling and a sothast / If thou may come
thereto and hold it the dare not run abowte here and there: and axe questyons
of every ghostly man what thou should do how thou shall love god: and how you
shalt serve god and speak of ghostly matters that passe^ thy knowing as
perchance some done / That manner of dooyng is not full profitable but if more
need make it / ^repe the to thy prayers stylly first with traueyle yt thou
might come afterward to this restfull feeling of ghostly prayer: and yt shall
teache the wisdom enough sothfastly without feynynge or fantasye. and keep it
fourth if thou have it and leave it not: but if grace come otherwise and woll
remeue it fro the for a time and make the for to worche on a another manner.
then^e may thou leave it for a time and after torn again thereto / And he that
has this grace in prayer asks not whereupon he shall set the point of his
thought in his prayer. whether upon ye words that he says or else on god or
on the name of Ihu^ as some ask. for the feeling of grace techith him well
enough? For why the soul is turned in to the eye and sharply beholds ye face
of Ihu^. and is made syker that it is Ihu^ that it felyth and sees / I mean
not Ihu^ as he is in himself in fulness of his blessed godhede. but I mean Ihu^
as he woll show him to a clean soul holden in body after the clen^esse that
it has / For wit thou well that euryche a feeling of grace is Ihu^ and may
be called Ihu^ / And after that the grace is more or less so felyth the soul
more or less Ihu^ / ye the fyste feeling of special grace in a begyn^er that
is called grace of compu^cco^n and contricio^ for his sins is verily Ihu^?
for why: he makes that contricyon in a soul by his presence / But Ihu^ is
then^e full boystously and rudely felt. full far fro his ghostly subtylte:
for the soul can no better ne may no better for vnclen^esse of itself then^e
Nevertheless afterward if the soul profit and increase in virtues and in
clen^es the same Ihu^ and none other is seen and felt of the same soul wha^ it
is towched with grace. but yt is more ghostly nere to the godly kind of Ihu^ /
And sothly yt is the most thing that Ihu^ loves in a soul that it might be
made godly and ghostly in syghte and in love like to him in grace to that yt he
is by kind. for that shall be the end of all lovers Then may you be syker
that what time yt thou felyste thy soul styred by grace specially in that
manner as it is before said by opening of thy ghostly eye thou see and
feleste Ihu^ / Hold him fast while thou may and keep the in grace: and let
him naught lightly fro the / Look after none other Ihu^ but that same by
feeling of that self grace more godly yt it might wexe in the more and more /
And dread the naught thou Ihu^ yt thou felyst be not Ihu^ as he is in his full
godhede that you sholdest therefore mow be deceived if thou lened to thy
feeling. but trust you well if thou be a lover of Ihu^ y^ thy felyng is true and
that Ihu^ is truly felt and seen of the through his grace as thou may see him
here / And therefore lene fully to thy feeling wh^ it is gracyous and ghostly:
and keep it tendly. and have great (...) not of thyselfe but of it. that thou
might see: and feel Ihu^ (...) better and better / For grace shall even teache
the by itself if tho^ wol fall thereto till you come to the end / But perchance
you beg^^ neste to wonder why I say one time that grace worchyth (...) this:
and on a another time yt love worcheth or god worchy^^ Unto this I say thus:
that when I say that grace worch^^^ I mean love: Ihu^: and god. for all is
one. and naught but (...) Ihu^ is love: Ihu^ is grace: Ihu^ is god / And for
he worcheth (...) in us by his grace for love as god^ therefore may I use wh^^
word of thise iiii. yt me list after my stiryng in this writing

How a soul through the opening of the ghostly eye receives a gracyous love
able to vndstonde holy wrytt / And how Ihesu that is hid in holy writ
shewyth himself to his lovers / Caplm xliii
THen^e ye soul of a lover felith Ihu^ in prayer in ye manner before said. and
thynkith yt it would never feel otherwise / Nevertheless it falls that sometime
grace puts scilence to vocal prayenge: and styreth the soul to see and to
feel Ihu^ in a another manner / And yt manner is first to see Ihu^ in holy writ
For Ihu^ that is al sothfastnes is hid and heled therein wou^den in a soft
sendyle vnd fair words that he may not be known felt but of a clean heart?
For why: sothfastnes woll not show itself to enmyes but to fre^des that love
and desire it with a meke heart. for sothfastnes and mekenes arne full true
systers fastened together in love and charity / and therefore is there no
leynynge of cou^seylle betwyxe hem two / Mekenes presumyth of sothfastnes and
no thing of itself: and sothfastnes tro with well on mekenes: and so they
accorden wond well / Then for asmoche as a soul of a lover is made meke
through inspiraco^n of grace by opening of the ghostly eye: and sees yt it is
naught of itself: but only hangs in the mercy and the godenes of Ihu^
lastyngly is born^ up by favor and help of him only: and truly desiring the
presence of him therefore sees it Jesus: For it sees sothfastnes of holy writ
wonderly showed and opened above study and traueyle and reason of man's
kyndly wit / And that may well be called the feeling and the perceiving of
Ihu^ / For Ihu^ is well of wisdom. and by a lityll heel dynge of his wysdom in
to a clean soul he makes the soul wise enough for to vndstonde all holy
wrytt. not all at ones in special beholding: but through that grace the soul
receives a new ablynes and a gracyous habyte for to vndstonde it specially
when it comith to mind This openyng and this clernesse of wit is made by the
ghostly presence of Ihu^ / For right as the gospel says of ii. discyples
going to the castle of Emaus bren^ynge in desire and spekyng of our lord
Ihu^: our lord appeared to hem presently as a pilgrim and taught hem yt
prophecyes of himself / And as the gospel says / Apperuit illis sensum vt
intelligerent scripturas / ^uc^ xiiii
He opened to hem clernes of wit that they might understand holy writynge /
Right so the ghostly presence of Ihesu openyth the wit of his lover that it
bren^eth in desire to him: and brings to his mind by mynystraco^n of angels
the words and the sentences of holy writ vnsoughte and unadvised one after a
another. and expowneth hem redily be they never so hard ne so preuy / The
harder that they ben and ferder fro man's reasonable understanding the more
delectable is the true showing of hem / When Ihesu is master it is expowned
and declared literally: morally: mystily: and heavenly. if the matter suffer it
/ By letter that is lyghteste and most plain is bodily kind comforted / By
moralte of holy writ the soul is infourmed of vices and virtues wisely to
cu^ne depart that one fro that other By mystyhed it is illumyned for to see ye
works of Ihesu in holy church. redily for to apply the words of holy writ
to christ our head: and to holy church that is his mysty body / And the fourth
that is heavenly longs only to the worchynge of love / And that is when all
sothfastnes in holy writ is applied to love / And for that is most like to
heavenly feeling therefore I call it heavenly / The lover of Ihu^ is his friend.
not for he has deserved it: but for Ihu^ of his merciful goodness makyth him
his friend by true accord / And therefore as to ^ true friend that pleyseth him
with love. not serves him (...) dread as a thralle: he shewith his preuyte /
Thus he says hym^selfe to his apostles / Iam vos dixi amicos qr quecunque
aud^ui a patre meo nota feci vobis / Now I say that ye are fren^des / For I
make known to you all things that I have herd of my fader / To a clean soul
that has the palett puryfyed from fylthe of flesshly love holy writ is
lyfely food and sustenaunce delectable /

It sauoureth wonder swetely when it is well chewed by goostly understanding?
For why: the spirit of lyffe is hid therein that quyckenyth all the myghtes
of the soul / and fylleth them full of swetnesse of heavenly sauoure and
ghostly delight / But sothly him needs to have white teeth and sharp and well
pycked that should byte of this ghostly bread / For flesshly lovers and
heritykes may not to wche the Inward flower of it / Her teeth are blody and
full of fylthe. therefore they ben fasting fro feeling of this bread / By teeth
are understand the Inly wits of ye soul. the which in flesshly lovers and
in heretykes ben blody full of sin and of worldly vanytees / They would and
they can not come by curyosite of her kyndly wit to y^ soth fastnes in
knowing of holy writ. for her wit is corrupt by origynall sin and
actuell also. And is not yet helyd through grace / And therefore they do but
gnawe upon the bark without speak they never so much thereof / The Inner
savor within they feel not of / They ben not meke they be^ not clean for to
see it / They ben not friends to Ihesu. and therefore he shows hem not his
counsel / The preuyte of holy writ is closed vnd a keye seeled with a
sygnett of Ihu^s finger: that is the holy ghost / And therefore wythouten his
love and his leave may no man come in / He has only the keye of cu^nynge in
his keeping as holy writ says. and he is keye himself / And he lets in
whom he woll by Inspyraco^n of his grace. and breketh not the selle. and yt
does Ihu^ to his lovers / Not to all ylike. but to hem that are specially
Inspyred for to seek sothfastnes in holy writ with great deuoco^n in prayeng:
and with much besynes in studyenge going before / Thise may come to the
fyndyng wha^ our lord Ihu^ wol show it / See now then^e how grace opens the
ghostly eye and clereth ye wit of the soul wondly above the freelte of
corrupt kind / It yeuyth the soul a new ableness whether it woll read holy
writ or here or think it for to vndstonde it truly and sauourly the
sothfastnes of it in the manner before said / And for to torn redily all
reasons and words that are bodily said in to ghostly vndstonding. and that is
no great merueyle / For the same spirit expownyth it and declares it in a
clean soul in comfort of it that first made it. and that is the holy ghost /
And this grace may be and is as well in lewd as in lettred men as anenstes the
substance and the true feeling of sothfastnes and the ghostly sauoure of it in
general though they see not so many reasons in special: for that needs not /
And when the soul is thus abled and lightened through grace. then^e it list for
to be alone some time out of lettynge or comonynge of all creatures that he
might freely assaye his Instrument that I call his reason in beholding of
sothfastnes that is contained in holy writ / And then^e there fall to mind
words and reasons and sentences enough to occupye him in full ordynate and
full sadly / And what comfort and ghostly delight: savor and swetnesse a soul
may feel then^e in his ghostly work thruh^ diverse Illumynaco^ns: Inly
perceyuynges: preuy knowynges and sodeyn towchynges of the holy ghost by assaye
the soul may wit and else not / And I hope that he shall not err be so
that his teeth that been his Inward wits be kept white and clean fro ghostly
pride and fro curyosite of kyndly wit / ^ hope that Dauyd felt full great
delight in this manner werk^ when he said thus / Q^^ dulcia faucibus meis eloquia
tua s^per mel ori meo / How sweet are thy spekynges lord Ihu^ (...) my chekes
over honey to my mouth / That is: Lord Ihu^ thy^ holy words endyted in holy
writ brought to my (...) through grace are swetter to my chekes: that are ye
affeco^ns o^ my soul than honey is to my mouth / Sothly this is a fair work
without paynfull traueylle for to see Ihesus thus / This is one manner of
syghte of Ihesu as I said before / Not as he is: but clothed under lyckenesse
of works and of words / Per speculum in enigmate / By a myrroure and by a
^yckenesse / As the appostle says / Ihesu is endeles might wisdom and
goodness: Ryghtwysnesse: soothfastnesse: holiness. and mercy / And what this
Ihesu is in him self may no soul see ne here. But by effect of his
worchynge he may be seen through the light of grace. as thus / His might is
seen by making of all creatures of naught. his wisdom in ordynate disposynge
of hem: his goodness in saving of hem his mercy in foryeuenesse of sins. his
holiness in yeftes of grace: his rightwysnes in hard punysshynge of syn^e.
his softnes in true rewardyng of good works / And all this is expressed in holy
writ. and this sees a soul in holy writ with all other accidents that
fallen herto / And wite thou well that such gracyous knowynges in holy wrytt or
in other writing that is made thorugh grace are naught else but sweet
letters senden and made betwyxe a loving soul and Ihu^ loved / Or else if I
shall say sothlyer betwyxe Ihu^ the true lover and the souls loved of him /
He has full great tendnes of love to al his chosen childern that are here
closed in claye of this bodily life / And therefore though he be absent fro hem
high hid above in the bosom of the fader fulfilled in delyces of the blessed
godhede. yet notwythstondyng he thinks upon hem and vysyteth hem full often
through his gracyous ghostly presence and comforts hem by his letters of holy
writ. and dryueth out of her hertes heaviness and werynes: dowtes and dredes.
and makes he^ glad and merry in him truly. trowynge to all his byhetynges
and mekely abydinge fulfyllyng of his will / Saint poul says thus / Quecu^que
scripta su^t ad nostra^ doctrina^ scripta sunt vt per consolacione^
scripturarum spe^ habeamus / To. xv.
All that is written to our techynge it is written that by comfort of writing
we might have hope of salvation / And this is a another work of co^templaco^n
for to see Ihu^ in scryptures after opening of the ghostly eye / The clenner
the syghte is in beholdynge. the more comforted is the affeccion in the
tastynge ^ A full little savor felt in a clean soul of holy writ in this
manner before said should make the soul set little price by knowing of all
the vii. arts. or of all the world of all woldly cu^nynges / For the end of
this knowinge is saluaco^n of a man's soul in everlasting life. and the end
of that other as for hemselfe is but vanytee and a passing delight: but if they
be turned through grace to this end.

Of the preuy voys of Ihesu sownyng in a soul whereby it shall be known / And
how all the gracyous Illumynaco^ns made in a soul ben called the spekynges of
Ihu^ / c. xliiii.
^O these are fair new felynges in a clean soul. and if a soul were
fulfilled with such it might be said. and sothly that it were reformed
somewhat in feeling: but not yet fully* for why: yet Ihesu shows more and
ledeth the soul Inner: and begins to speak more homely and more lovely to a
soul. and ready is the soul then to follow the sty^yng of grace / For the
prophet says / Quocu^que ibat spu^s i^ luc gradiebantur et rote sequentes eu^
/ whed so yede the spi^yte thider yede the wheles following him / By wheles
are understand the true lovers of Ihu^ / For they are round in virtue without
angyle of frowardenes. and lightly whyrlynge thorugh redynesse of will to the
styryng of grace / For after tha^ grace styreth and techeth: so they follow
and worche as the prophet says / But they have first a full siker assaye and
^ true knowinge of the voys of grace or they may do so th^^ they be not
deceived by her own feynyng of by the mydda^^ fend / Our lord Ihesu says
thus of his lovers / Oues (...) vocem mea^ audiu^t et cognosco eas and
cognoscu^t me me / ^
(...) sheep heren my voys and I know hem and they know me The preuy voys of
Ihesu is full true. and it makyth a soul true / There is no feynyng in it ne
fantasye ne pride ne ypocrysy / But softness: meekness: pees. love: and
charytee. And it is full of life love and grace / And therefore when it so wnyth
in a soul it is of so great might some time that the soul suddenly lays
of hand all that there is. prayenge: speaking: redynge or thinking in the
manner before said. and all manner bodily work and lystnyth thereto fully heryng
and perceyuinge in rest and in love the sweet steven of this goostly voys. as
it were rauysshed fro ye mind of all erdely things / And then^e some time
shows Ih^u in this pees himself as an hawtful master and sometime as a
reverent fader: and sometime as a lovely sponse / And it kepyth a soul in a
wondfull reverence and in a lovely beholdynge of him that ye soul lyketh well
then. and never so well as then / For it felyth so great sykernesse and
so great rest in Ih^u and so much favor of his goodness yt it would ever be
so and never do other work / It thinkith yt it touchith Ih^u and thruh^
virtue of ye unspeakable touching it is made hole and stable in itself
reverently beholding only Ih^u^ as if there were no thing but Ih^u oo thing
and be a another. borne up only by ye savor and ye wondful goodness of him y^
is that thing yt he felyth and sees / And this feeling is often times without
special beholdynge of holy writ. ne but with few words formyd in ye heart.
naught but thus among fallen in sweet words according to y^ feeling: either
loving or worshyppyng or wondryng: or other wise sownynge as the heart lykyth
/ The soul is full much departed fro love or likynge of the world thorugh
ve^^ue of this gracyous feeling / And also fro mind of the world much in the
mean time / It takyth none head thereof for it has no time thereto / But
then^e sometime anon with this fallyth ^n to a soul diverse Illumynacio^s
thruh^ grace. yt which Illumynaco^ns I call the spekinges of Ihu^ and the
sight of ghostly ^hynges / For wit you well that all the besynes yt Ihu^ makith
a ^^ut a soul. is for to make it a true perfyte spouse to him in ^^e hynes and
the fulness of love. And yt may not be done so sode^ ^^ therefore Ihu^ yt is love
and of all lovers the wysest assayeth by many wyses and by many wondful means
or it may come about And therefore that it might come to theffecte of true
spousage he has such gracyous spekynges this manner of a wower to a chose^
soul / He shows his preuy Jewels. much thing he gives and more he
behiteth. and curteys daliau^ce he shewith / Often he visyteth with much grace
and ghostly comfort as I before said / but he hwo does this in specyal al
fully can I not tell the. for it needs not / Nevertheless somewhat shall I say
after that grace styreth / The drawyng of a soul fully to perfyte love is
first by the showing of ghostly things to a clean soul when the ghostly eye
is openid. not that a soul should rest therein. and make an end there: but by
that seche him and love him only that is highest of al without any beholding
of any other thing than himself / But what are these ghostly things say
you. for I speak often of ghostly things / To this I answer and say. that
ghostly thing may be said all the sothfastnes of holy writ / And therefore a
soul that through ^yghte of grace may see the sothfastnes of it. it sees
ghostly things as I have before said /

How through gracyous opening of the ghostly eye a soul is made wise mekely
and sothfastly to see the dyuersyte of degrees in holy church as traueylynge /
And for to see angels kind and first of reproved / Caplm xlv^
Nevertheless other ghostly things there be^ also the which through light of
grace are showed to the soul. and (...) these / The kind of all reasonable
souls. and the gracyous wo^chynge of our lord Ihu^ in hem / The kind of
angels bless^^ and reproved and her worchyng: and the knowing of the bless^^
trynyte after that grace techith / Holy writ says in the book of songs of
the spouse thus / ^
Surga^ and circuibo ciuitate^ and que ra^ que^ diligit ai^a mea / I shall rise
and I shall goo about the cite and I shall seche him that my soul loves /
That is: I shall rise in to highness of thought and goo about the cite / By
this cite is vndstonde the university of all creatures bodily and ghostly
ordained and ruled under god by laws of kind of reason and of grace / I goo
abowte this cite when I behold the kinds and the causes of bodily creatures^
the yeftes of grace and the blyssis of ghostly creatures^ and in all thise I
seche him that my soul loves / It is fair lokynge with the In^er eye on Ihu^
in bodily creatures for to see his might: his wisdom and his goodness in
ordinance of her kind: but it is much fayrer lokinge on Ihu^ in ghostly
creatures / First in reasonable souls both chosen and reproved to see the
merciful callyuge of him to chosen. how he torneth he^ fro sin^e by light of
his grace. how he helps hem: techeth hem: chastith hem. co^fortith hem. he
ryighteth he cleanses he fedeth: how he makes hem bren^ing in love and in
light by plente of his grace / And thus does he not to one soul only but to
all his chose^ after mesure of his grace / Also of al reproved how ryghtfully
he forsakyth hem and leueth hem in her sins and does hem no wrong. How he
rewards hem in this world suffrynge hem to have the fulfillyng of her will
and after to punyssh^ hem endlesly / Lo this is a lityll beholdynge of holy
church whiles it is in traueylyng in this life to seen how black and how
foul it semyth in souls that are reproved: how fair and how lovely it is in
chosen souls And all this ghostly syte is naught else but the syghte of
Ihu^. not in himself but in his merciful preuy works and in his rightwys
domes every day showed and remembered and renewed to reasonable souls / Also
over this to see with the ghostly eye ye pains of reproved. and the Joy and
the bliss of chosen souls it is full comfortable / For sothfastnes may not be
seen in a clean soul without great delight and wondfull softnes of blessed
bren^ynge love / Also the syghte of angels kind: first of dampened and after
that of the blessed / It is a full fair contemplaco^n of the fend in a clean
soul when grace brings the fend to the syghte of the soul as a clumsid
caytyf bounden with the might of Ihu^ that he may not dear / Then^e the soul
beholds him not bodily but ghostly seenge his kind and his malice. and
torneth him up so down and spoylleth him and renteth him all to naught:
scorneth him and dispyseth him and sets naught by his malice / Thus bids
holy writ when it says thus / Verte impiu^ et no^ erit / Torn the wicked:
that is the fend up soodowne and he shall be as naught / ^
Much wond has the soul that the fend has somoche malice and so lityll
might / There is no creature so vnmyghty as he is: and therefore it is a great
cowardnesse that men dreden him somoche / He may no thing do without leave
of our lord Ihu^. not somoche as enter in to a swyne as the gospel says
Much less may he do then^e to noye any man / And then^e if our lord Ihu^
give hem leave to tarry us it is full worthily and mercyfully done that our
lord Ihu^ does. and therefore welcome be our lord Ihu^ by himself and by all
his messengers / The soul dredeth no more than the blustrynge of the fend than
ye stirynge of a mows / wuder wroth is the fe^de if he durst say nay. but
his mouth his stopped with his own malice. his hondes are bounden as a theyf
worthy to be demid and hanged in hell And then^e the soul accusyth him and
ritfully demith him after that he has deserved / wond not of this saying. for
saint poul meaned the same wha^ he said thus / Fre^s nescitis qm^ anglos
iudicabimus / Brethern wot ye not well that we shall deem angels. that are
wicked spirytes through malice that were made good angels by kind / As who
says yes / This dem^ge is fygured before the dome in contemplatyfe souls /
For they feel a lityl tasting in lyknes of al yt shall be done aftward of our
lord Ihu^ openly in sothfastnes / shamid and shent is ye fe^de greatly in
himself. wha^ he is thus fared with a clean soul. He would fayn flee away and
he may not for ye myte of ye hiest holds him still: and yt greuith him more
tha^ al ye fire of hell. wond mekely fallith ye soul to ihu^ then^e with hertly
louinges yt he so mytly saves a simple soul fro al malice of so fell a enmie
by his great merci.

How by the same light of grace the blessed angels kind may be seen / And
how Ihu^ is god and man above all creatures after that the soul may see him
here / Caplm xlvi.
ANd then^e after this by the self light may the soul see ghostly the
fa^rhede of angels the worthiness of hem in kind. the subtylte of hem in
substance: the co^fermynge of he^ in grace. and the fullness of endless bliss*
y^ sou^dryhede of orders the distyncco^ns of persons how they live all in
light of sothfastnes endless. and how they bren^e all in love of the holy ghost
after the worthynes of orders. how they see and love and praise Ihu^ in blessed
rest without ceesinge / There is no sight of body: ne no figure in
ymaginaco^n in this manner worchinge but all ghostly and. of ghostly creatures /
Then^e begyn^eth the soul to have great aqueyntau^ce of the blessed spirytes
and a great felishyp / They are full tend and full besye about such a soul
to help it / They are masters to teache it. and often through her ghostly
presence and towchynge of her light driven out fantasyes fro the soul: and
they Illumyn the soul graciously. they comfort the soul by sweet words
suddenly sowned in a clean heart / And if any disease fall ghostly they seruen
the soul and mynystre to it all that it needs / Thus saint poul said of he^ /
No^ne oe^s su^t administratorii sp^us missi propter eos qui hereditate^ capiu^t
salutis / Heb^ ^.
wot ye not well that holy spirytes are minysters sent of Ihu^ for hem that
taken the heritage of health These are chosen souls: as who says yes / For
wit you well that all this ghostly worchyng of words and of reasons brought
to the minde^ and such fair liknes are made by the mynistery of angels when
the light of grace abu^dantly shinyth in a clean soul / It may not be told
by tongue the felynges the lyghtnynges the graces and the co^fortes in special
that clean sowles perceive through favorable selyshyp of blessed angels / The
soul is well at eace with hem to behold how they done that it would tend to
no thing else / But then^e with the help of the angel yet the soul sees
more for knowinge ryseth above all this in a clean soul / And yt is to behold
the blessed kind of Ihu^ / First of his glorious manhede how it is hygh^^
worthily above all angels kind. and then after of his bless^^ godhede / For
by knowing of creatures is known the creat^ur. and then^e begyn^eth the soul
to perceive a little of the pr^^^tees of the blessid trinyte / It may well
ynough^ for light of grace gooth before. and therefore she shall not err aslo^ge

of the which holy wrytt says thus / Porro ad me dcm^ est vbu^ absconditu^ et

veins of his rowuynges mine eere has perceived / The Inspyraco^n of Ihu^ is an
