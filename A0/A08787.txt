Come worldling see what pains I here do take, To gather gold while here on
earth I rake.
What the Father gathers by the Rake, the Son does scatter with the Forke.


COme, come my brave gold,
Which I love to behold,
come to me and I Will give you rest;
Where as you may sleep,
And I safely will keep
you locked in my iron bound chest;
No thieves you shall fear,
You in pieces to tear,
such care of you still I will take,
Come to me and fly
Gold Angels I cry,
And I Will gather you all with my Rake.
Come silver and all,
When as I do call,
your beauties to me are so bright
I love you so dear,
I pray you come near,
and be you not wavering or light,
Your weight so you have,
Come glistering and brave,
then you I will never forsake,
But heap you together,
Against rainy weather,
And gather you all with my Rake.
Rich Jewels and plate,
By no means I hate,
with Diamonds, Saphirs, or rings;
The Carbuncle red,
Stands me in like stead,
or any other rich things,
The Emerold green,
Like the spring that is seen,
gold chains, or the like I will take,
I have a kind heart,
With my coin I will part,
so I may get all with my Rake.
But yet here me, friend,
No money I Will lend,
without a good pawn you do bring,
But I Will tell to thee,
How a knave cheated me
one time with a base copper Ring,
With me it bred strife,
It near cost me my life,
half a crown on the same he did take
But I Will have more care,
Of such knaves to be ware,
how such copper together I rake.
On leases or lands,
On very good bands,
good security likewise provide,
If we can agree,
Then my coin it flies free,
if not, your could suit is denied,
To foe or to friend,
No money I Will lend,
as they brew, so let them bake,
This rule I observe,
Let them hang or starve,
if I cannot get with my Rake.
And those that do lack,
To the highth I do rack,
I know that they money must have
Some morgage their lands,
Which fall in my hands,
to domineere and to go brave,
^
If they fail of their day,
And have not to pay,
a seizure on all I do make,
Although I go bare,
Yet I have a care,
my gold and my silver to Rake.
Let the poor widows cry,
Let their children dye,
let their Father in prison go rot,
What is that to me,
Their wealth is my fee,
for I have their livings now got,
UUhole Lordships and Lands,
Are fallen to my hands,
and use of them all I will make,
My bags full of coin,
And my purse I do line,
with that which together I rake.
Thus rich usury,
Never thinking to dye,
nor on his poor soul have a care,
With one foot in the grave,
Yet more wealth he does crave,
and his back and his belly does spare;
At whose cost he dine,
With good cheer and wine,
he cares not at whose hands he take,
Not a penny he will spend,
Nor without a pawn lend,
The Devil and all he will Rake.
But now comes grim death,
And cease his breath,
his tree of life is wethered,
This wretch so unkind,
His wealth leaves behind,
and is a poor worm being dead:
But now pray give ear,
To that you shall hear,
his heir what a course he will take;
That day he did dye,
In his grave he did lie,
And the Sexton the earth on him Rake.
London printed for Henry Gosson (...)

Come Prodigals, your selves that loves to flatter, Behold my fall, that with
the Forke does scatter.
To the tune of, To drive the cold winter away.

Room, room for a friend,
That his money will spend,
old Flatcap is laid in his grave,
He kept me full poor,
But now I will roar,
his lands and his livings I have,
The tide of gold flows,
And wealth on me grows,
he is dead, and for that it is no matter,
Great use he did take.
And for me did rake,
which now with the forke I will scatter.
I now must turn gallant,
That have such a talent,
what need I to take any care,
I tell thee good friend,
It Is mine own which I spend,
for I was my Fathers own heir:
No Blade here shall lack,
Give us claret and sack,
hang pinching, it is against nature,
Let Us have all good cheer,
Cost it never so dear,
for I with my forke will scatter.
Let me have a Less
That fair Venus does pass,
give me all delights that I may,
I Will make my gold fly
Aloft in the sky,
I think it will never be day:
Let the welkin roar,
I Will never give over,
Tobacco, and with it strong water,
I mean for to drink,
Until I do sink,
for I with my forke will scatter.
And let music play
To me night and day,
I scorn both my silver and gold,
Brave gentlemen all,
I Will pay what you call,
with me I beseech you be bold:
Dice run low or high,
My Gold it shall fly,
I mean for to keep a brave quarter,
Let the Cards go and come,
I have a great sum,
That I with my forke will scatter.
Let Carouses go round,
Till some fall to the ground,
and here is to my Mistress her health
Then let us take no care,
For no cost we will spare,
hang money, I have store of wealth,
My Father it got.
And now fallen to my lot,
I scorn it as I do mortar,
For coin was made round,
To stand on no ground,
And I with my forke will it scatter,
My Lordships to sell,
I think would do well,
ill gotten goods never do thrive:
Let Us spend while we may,
Each Dog has his day,
I Will want not while I am alive:
Come Drawers, more sack,
And see what we lack,
for money I Will send a porter,
Brave gallants never fear
For we will domineere,
For I with my forke will scatter.
Come, drink to my friend,
And let the health end,
my Coffers and Pockets are empty,
I now have no more,
That had wont to have store,
there is scarcity where there was plenty,
My friends are all gone,
And left me alone,
I think I must now drink cold water:
There Is naught but sad woe,
Upon me does grow,
Because with my forke I did scatter.
Now this is the story,
Of prodigal glory,
who thought that he never should lack
No drink nor no meat,
Now he has to eat,
nor clothes for to put on his back:
His friends they forsake him,
And woe does over take him,
because he was too free of nature,
That never did mind,
How time comes behind,
who mows, though with fork he did scatter.
His leaves they grew green,
But they were not seen,
for Autumn them quickly did kill,
Then let youth beware,
And have a great care,
and trust not too much to their will,
Least a prison them catch,
Or a house without thatch,
and glad of brown bread and cold water
To God thanks lets give,
And in a mean live,
having a care how we do scatter.
FINIS.
