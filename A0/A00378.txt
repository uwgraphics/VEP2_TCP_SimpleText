An exhortation to the diligent study of scripture / made by Erasmus
Roterodamus. And translated in to inglissh.

An exposition in to the seventh chaptre of the first pistle to the Corinthians.

LActantius Firmianus / Christen Reader (whose eloquence sanct Hierome does
greatly avaunce) endeveringe him silf to defend and maintain the chasten
faith and religion / against the craftye and unfaithful gentles / did wish
and desire with fervent affection to attain the eloquence next unto Tullyes /
coun^inge it an high presumptyou (as I think) if he should have desired equal.
How be yt I truly / if that wisshes could any thing avaylle / at the least
while I exhort and entyse all mortal men unto the most holy and wholesome
study of Christian wisdom / and pure Philosop^ye / would hartelye desire an
other manner of eloquence to be geve^ unto me / the^ ever cicero had / all
though not so gloriously painted and colored as his was yet truly of more
power and efficacite / ye soch a vehement persuasion and strength of eloquence
would I desire / as ye fables of old poets have noted in mercurius / who^ they
fained (as it had been with a rod of inch^unteme^t / and a melodious harp)
to cast me^ en to a sode^ and oblivious sleep / and again to reyse the^ at his
own pleasure / depressi^ge some (yt are allected with his heve^ly armonye) in
to ye depthe of plutos i^pery. And bri^gi^ge the^ again out of all ve^acions
Other soch as they ascribed to Amphion and Orpheus / for they imagine that ye
one with his armonious harp did move the stiff stones. And that the other
made to follow hi^ the insensible trees. Other soch as the frenshmen apply to
Hercules Ogmius faini^ge that he leads about all men with his godly
eloquence as it were with certain small chains which are tied unto his tongue
and run through every man's ceres. Other soch as the doo^inge old age did
attribute unto marsyas. O^ else truly (because we will not be long in repetynge
fables) soch as Al^ibiades has granted unto Socrates. And the old comedye
unto pericles / which may not only entyse and delight the ceres with a short
and corruptible delectacion or pleasure. But also may leve perpetual pri^kes
and instigacyons in the minds of the hearers / which may ravysshe and
transform them / and l^ve them in an other mind then they were before. The
noble musicyon Timotheus (as we r^ade^) with his proporcioned armonye was wont
to inflame Alexander the great conqueror with a fervent desire to war. And
there have been in times paste / that have counted nothing of more power and
efficacite then thenchauntementes / which the Greeks call epodas. Now if there
be any soch kind of enchauntement or charm. If there be any strenght in mus^^^
and armonye. If there be any pleasant persuasion / which has power to allecte
man's mind in to here sentence / the same at this ceas^n / would I gladly
obtain to thentent that I might persuade unto all men that thing which is
most wholesome and most profitable unto them. All though it were better / ye and
more convenient to desire that Christ him silfe (whose cause I entreat) would so
tempre the stringes of our instrument / that this song may prosperousl^
entyse and mov^ / the minds of all me^. For this porp^^ ^ewe need but little
the painted argumen^^^ and colored conclusions of ye Rhetori^^^ns / for
nothing so surely can garnisshe and perform that / that we desire as the
truth it silf / which when it is most plain and simple / is of most vehemen^
^fficacite in persuading. Nether do I coun^e it best at this time to revocat^
and call to memory the sorrowful complain to (all though it be not new yet
alas it is to ^^ue / and I think it could never be more iu^tlye verefied then
at this present time) that sith with soch great diligence all men's inve^cyons
are studied and commended / yet only this immortal fontayne of Christ's pure
philosophye / is despised and mocked of so many / ye and cheflye of them
which profess to be the heddes and examples of the Christen / few there are
that seek these wholesome springes of health / And yet they that seek them / do
so vnfruetfully look upon them Adding their own glosses and opinions that they
seame rather to troble and defile these springes of liffe / then to drink of
the^ swetely / that they might have in them silf floddes of livi^ge water /
ru^ninge in to everlastinge liffe / which both should be to the glory of god /
and profitte of the Christen.

We se that in all other sciences which by man's polycy have been invented /
there is no misterye so dark and secret / but that the quyckenes of our
wit has attained it / there is nothing so hard / but that diligent labor
has subdued it unto him. how chau^ceth it the^ yt we embrace not / with
faithful hearts (as it is convenient) this pure philosophy / sith we profess
the holy name of Christ? Platos adherentes / Pithagoras scholars: The
Academikes / Sto^kes Epicures. The fautores of Aristotle and disciples of
Diogenes / know growndly ye and by heart / the traditions of their own sect
/ And fight most fersly for them Redye rather to dye / the^ to forsake their
patron and author. And why do not we much more geve our minds and studyes /
unto our master and prince Christ / who would not count it a foul thing / ice
and a great rebuke to him that professes Aristotle's philosophye / if he be
ignorant what his master judges / concerning the cawses of the thunder / of
the raynbow / of the erthquakes / And of soch othernaturall causes? which
though they were known or unknown / Make not the^ that labor to know them
happy nor unhappy. And should we which are so many ways consecrated / and
with so many sacraments bownde unto christ: think it no shame awhitte / to
be ignorant in his scripture and doctrine / which geve us most sure comfort
and felicite? And which are the anchor of the soul both sure and stable /
preservinge us from perisshinge in all tempests of temptation? How be it / for
what intent use we this comparison / since it is extreme madness to compare
Christ with Zeno and Aristotle / and his hevenlye doctrine / with their tri
felinge traditions.

Let them feign and imagyne unto the captains of their sect as much as they
may / y^e as much as they will. Yet truly. Only this master and teacher / came
from heven / which alone could teach sure things / being the everlastinge
wisdom af the father which alone has taught holsom things / being the
fundation of all man's health: which alone has ful^illed to the uttermost
point / all that he has taught: and which alone may parforme / what so ever he
has promised. If any thing had been brought from the chaldes or the
Aegiptions / we would the more gredelye desire to know it / be cause it came
far / and from a strange contrye (ye it is the more dear and precious that
comethe from a far) And we are often times so grevouslye vexed about the
dream and phantasye of a folyssh fellow (not only with small profute / but also
with great loss of time) that it is shame to rehearse it. I wonder yt this
desire does not likwisse ticle and entyse the Christen hearts / which know well
enough (as the thing is in deed) that this wholesome doctrine came not from
Aegipte or Syria. But from the very heven and sete of god. Why do we not think
with our selves on this manner / It must needs be a new and mervelous kind of
learning / sith that god him silf which was immortal / became a natural man
and mortal / descendinge from the right hand of his father / in to this
wretched world / to teach it unto us / It must needs be a high and excellent
thing / and no trifle / which that hevenlye and mervelous master came ^o teach
openly. Why do we not go about to know / search ^o try out with a godly
curiosyte / this fruetfull Philosoph^e? Since that this kind of wisdom being
so profounde and inscrutable that utterly it damneth and confounds as
folyssh all the wisdom of this world May be gad^r^d out of so small books
(...) out of most pure springes / And that with much less labor / the^ the
doctrine of Aristotle out of so many brawlinge and contentious books / Or of
soch infinite commentaryes which do so much dissent / Be sides the inco^perable
fruit which needs not here to be spoken of. Nether is it needful that thou be
clogged with so many irxome and ba belinge sciences / The means to this
philosophye are easy and at hand / do only thy diligence to bring a godly and
ready mind / cheflye endewed with plain and pure faith Be only desirous to be
instruct / and co^firmable to this meake doctrine / And thou have much
profited. Thy master and instructor (that is the sprete of god) will not from
the be absent / which is never more gladly present with any / then with simple
and plain hearts. Men's doctrines and traditions (be sides the promessinge of
false felicite) do confound many me^nes wits / and make them clean to
despair be cause they are so dark / craftye / and co^tentious / But this
delectable doctrine does apply her silf equallye of all men submittinge her
silf unto us / while we are childer / temperinge her tune after our capacyte /
feadinge us with milk / forberinge / norisshinge / sufferinge / and doing all
things / until we may encreasse / and wex great^er in Christ / And
contrarywisse it is not so low and depressed unto the weak but it is as high
and mervelous to the parfecte / Ye y^ more thou wadest in the tresurs of this
science / the farther thou art from attayninge her mageste. To the childer she
is low and plain / and to greatter / she seameth above all capacite. She
refuses no age / no kind / no fortune / no state and condition.

In so much that the son is not more comen and indifferent to all men / then
this doctrine of Christ. She forbeddeth no man at all: Except he abstain
willinglye / envyinge his own profitte. And truly I do greatly dissent from
those men / which would not that the scripture of Christ should be translated in
to all tongues / that it might be read diligently of the private and seculare
men and women / Other as though Christ had taught soch dark and insensible
things / that they could scante be understand of a few divines. Or else as
though the pithe and substance of the christen religion consisted chefly in
this / yt it be not known. Paraventure it were most expedient that the
councels of kings should be kept secret / but Christ would that his councelles
and mysteries should be sprede abroad as much as is possible. I would desire that
all women should read the gospel and Paul's epistles / and I would to god they
were translated in to the tongues of all men / So that they might not only be
read / and known / of the scotes and yryshmen / But also of the Turks and
sarracenes / Truly it is one degree to good livi^ge / y^e ye first (I had
almost said the cheffe) to have a little sight in ye scripture / though it be
b^t a gross knowledge / and not yet co^su^matte) Be it in case that some would
laugh at it / ye and that some should err and be deceaved) I would to god / ye
plowma^ would singe a text of the scripture at his plowbeme / And that the
wever at his lowme / with this would drive away the tediousnes of time. I would
the wayfaringe man with this pastyme / would expelle the werynes of his journey.
And to be short I would that all the communication of the christen should be of
the scripture / for in a manner soch are we our selves / as our daily tales
are. Let every man prospere / and attain tha^ he may / And declare
effectuously his mind unto his neghburre / Let not hi^ that comes behind
envye the foremoste / Let also the formoste allecte him that follows / ever
exhortinge him not despair. Why do we apply only to certain the profession /
/ which is indifferent and comen to all men? Nether trluy is it me^e (sith that
baptime is equ^lly come^ unto all Christen men / wherin^ consists the first
profession of the christen religion. Since other sacraments are not private /
and to conclude. Since the reward of immortalite partaineth indyfferently unto
all men / that only the doctrine should be banisshed from the seculare / and
possessed only of a few whom the comunalte call devines / or religious parsons.
And yet I would that ^hese (allthough they be but a small company in comparison
to the hole number which bear the name of Christ and are called Christen) I
would (I say) desire with all mine heart / that they were in deed soch as they
are called / for I am a frayde that a man may find some among the divines
which are far unworthy their name and title / that is to say / which speak
wordly things and not godly: ye and among the religious which profess the
poverte of Christ And to despise the world / thou shall find more wordlye
pleasure and vanyte / then in all the world be sides. Him do I count a true
divine which not with craftye and sotle reasons. But that in heart /
countenance / eyes / and lyffe does teach / to despise riches. And that a
Christen ought not to put confidence in the sucker / and help of this world:
But only hole to hang on heven. Not to avenge iniurye. To pray for them that
say evyll by us. To do good against evyll. That all good men should be loved and
norisshed indifferently / as the members of one body. That evyll men if they
can not be reformed and brought in to a good order ought to be suffered. That
they which are despoyled of their goods / and put from their po^^essions^ And
morn in this world / are very blyssed and not to be lamented. That death is
to be desired of the Christen / sith it is nothing else / But a going to
immortalyte. If any man being enspired with the holy ghost do prechand teach
these and soch other things / If any man exhort / entyse / and bolden his
neghbore unto these things / he y^ a very and true devine / though he be a
wever / ye though he dygge and delve. But he that accomplissheth and
fulfylleth these things in his liffe and manners / he verily is a great doctor.
Paraventure another which is not Christen shall more subtyllye dispute / by
what manner the Angels understand: How be it to persuade and exhort / that we
may here lyve pure and immaculate from all vices and iniquites. And to lead an
angels liffe / that is the office and deutye of a Christen and devine. If any
man would obiecte / and say that these are gross / and vnsavery things. To him
would I none other wysse answer. But that Christ chefly has taught these
things. And that the Apostles to these have us exhorted. This learning and
doctrine be it never so vnsaverye has brought us forth so many good christen
/ and so thike swarms of faithful martyrs. This unlearned (as they call it)
philosophy / has subdued under her laws the most noble princes so many
kingdoms / so many nations: which thing no kings power. Another learning of
the philosophers was ever able to bring to pass: Another will I resist the^
but that they may dispute their profounde and sotle questions (if it please
them) among the more perfect / how be it the rude multitude of the christen
may be comforted / be cause truly thappostles did never teach soch things.
Whether they knew them or no I would other men should judge.

But truly if that the princes for their part would remember them selves / and
go about to fulfill with pureness of lyvinge / this humble and rude learning
(as they call it) If the prechers in their sermones would avaunce this doctrine
/ exhortinge all men unto it / and not to their own phantasyes and
imaginacions. If scolemasters would instruct their children rather with this
simple science then with the wittye tradicyons of aristotle and averroys. Then
should the Christente be more at quyetnes. And not be disturbed with soch
perpetual storms of dissentyon and war. Then should thy^ unreasonable desire
of avarice / which appeteth riches insatiablye whether it be right or wrong /
be somedealle aswaged / and cease of his rage. Then should these contentious
pleatinges / which now in all things admixte them selves^have an end. For no
man would resist evyll / and to be short. Then should we not differ only in
title and certain ceremonies from the hethen and unfaithful. But rather in the
pure conversation of our liffe. And no doubt in these three degrees of men /
that is to say. In princes and officers which are in their stead. In bisshopes
and other prestes which are their vicars. And in them that bring vpe the
tender youth / which are formed and reformed even as their master entyseth them
Does chefly consiste the hole power other to encreasse the christian religion.
Or else to restore it again which has long been in decaye^. Now if these
would a while seclude their own private business and lift up their hearts
with a pure intent unto christ seakynge only his glory / and the profit of
their neghbore / we should severely with in few years / a true and godly kind
of Christen spring up in everye place / which would not only in ceremonies /
dispitions / and titles profess the name of Christ. But in their very heart
and true co^versatio^ of levinge. By this armure should we much sooner prevail
against the unfaithful / and ennymyes of Christ / then with strenghte
^violence / and threatteninges. Let us join to gedder all armies / powers /
and might of sword / yet is there nothing stronger the^ the truth. We can
not call any ma^^ a platoniste / unless he have read the works of plato. Yet
call we them Christen / ye and devines / which never have read the scripture
of Christ. Christ says / he that loves me does keep my sainges / this is the
knowledge and mark which he has prescribed. Therefore if we be true Christen
men in our hearts / if we beleve vnfanedly that he was sent down from heven
to teach us soch things as the wisdom of ye philosophers could never attain
If faithfully we trust or look for soch things of him / as no wordly prince
(be he never so rich) can geve unto us: why have we any thing in more
revere^ce and authorite / then his scripture / word / and promise / which he
left here among us to be our consolacyon? Why recounte we any thing of
gravite or wisdom / which dissenteth from his doctrine? Why in this heve^ly and
mis^icall^ learning do we country / and discant runni^ge more at ryote / The^
the comen and porophane intevretors / in the cyville law / or bofes of
Phisike? Wyndinge our selves in it as in a tryfelinge game / or ^atter of
small substance / commentyng^ / ^ossinge and wr^stinge it even as it comet^ to
our tongues end. We apply and draw / this hevenly and unspotted doctrine unto
our liffe. And measure it after our ^^yne conversation according unto the
manner of the lesbes which bend their rule to the facyon of their stone or
tymbre / And cut no^ their stone and ^imb^e to the rule. And because we will
not be seen ignora^te in any thing / but rather that we have read and know
much / we do (I dare not say) corrupt these fruitful springes / but that no
man can deny we appropriatie unto a few men that thing which Christ would have
most come^. And this kind of philosophye does rather consist in the affectes
of the mind / then in sorle reasons. It is a liffe rather then a disputacyon.
It is an inspiracion rather then a science. And rather a new transformacion /
then a reasoninge. It is a seldom thing to be a well learned man / but it i^
lefull forc^ very man to be a true christian. It is lefull for every man to lyve
a godly lyffe / ye and I dare be bold to say it is lefull for everye man to be
a pure divine. Now does every ma^ne^ mind incline unto that which is wholesome
and expedient for his nature. And what other thing is this doctrine of Christ
which he calls the new regeneracyon / But a rest orynge or reparynge of our
nature which in his first creacyon was good? A man may find very many
things in the gentles books / which are a^reable unto this doctrine. All
though no man has showed it so absolutely. Nether yet with soche efficacite as
christ him silf / for there was never soch a rude and gross sect of
philosopye / which did teach that man's felicite rested on monye / there was
none so shamles to affirm ye the cheffe point and ground of goodness consisted
in this wordly honor and pleasurs The stoikes did knowledge that no man might
worthily be called wisse except he were a good and virtuous lyver / nether
that enythi^ge was verelye good and honest / but only virtue. And that nothing
was evil and to be abhorred. But only vice and sin / Socrates (as plato
makes mention) did teach by many reasons / that iniurye ought not to be
avenged with iniurye. Be taught also yt since the soul is immortal / they are
not to be morned for which depart hence / if they have leved well / be cause
they are gone in to a more prosperous liffe. Finally he taught and exhorted all
men to subdue the affections of their bodies. And to apply their souls to the
contemplacyon of those things / which truly are immortal / all though they
be not seen with these bodily eyes. Aristotle writes in his politikes that
there can nothing be so sweet and delycyous to man But that at sometime yt does
displease him only virtue except. The Epicure grants that there can be
nothing delectable and pleasante in this liffe except the mind and conscience
from whence all pleasure spring be clear / and with out grutche of sin /
besides that there have been some / that have fulfilled a great part of this
doctrine. And che^ly of all Gocrates / Siogenes / and Epictetus / how be it
since / Christ him silfe has both taught and also done these things more
consummatly then any other / is yt not a mervelous thing that these things
are not only unknown of them which profess the name of Christ. But also to
be despised of them / ye and to be made a laughinge stock? If there be any
thing that goethe more nere to Christianite / let us then disanulle these
things / and follow them. But since there is no another thing that can make a
true Christen man / Why then do we recounte this immortal doctrine more
abrogate and out of use then the books of Moses? The first point of
Christianite is to know what Christ has taught. The next is to do there after
and to fulfill it as nygh as god g^veth us grace /

Nether think I that any man will count him silfe a faithful Christen /
because he can despute with a craftye / and tedious perplexite of words / of
relatyons / quiddityes / and formalites / But in that he knowledgeth and
expresses in dede^ those things which Christ both taught and accomplisshed.
Nether speak I thy^ to discommende their study and labor / which have
exercysed their wits in these sotle invencyons (for I would offend no man) But
rather be cause I beleve (as the matter is in dead) that the very pure and
natural phylosoph^e of Christ / can be gathered out so frutefully of no place
/ as out of the Gostpels and epistles of the apostle^ / in which if a man will
study devoutelye attendinge m ore to prayer / the^ arguinge) desynnge rather
to be made a new man then to be armed with scriptures unto contention / he with
out doubt shall find / that there is nothing pertayninge unto man's felicyte
/ other clles unto any operacion ex^edient unto thi^ present liffe. But it is
declared / discussed / and absolutely touched. If we go about to learn any
thing / werfore shall an other master and instructor more please us then
christ him silf? If we require a rule and form to lyve after / why do we
rather embrace an other example then the very first copy and pa^trone which is
christ hymsilfe? If we desire an wholesome medycyne against the grevous and
noisome / lusts or app^tytes / of our minds. Why seake we not here the most
fr^tefull remedy? If we appe^e to quycken and refresshe with readinge / our
dull and fayntinge mind. I pray the where shall we find soch quycke and firye
sparkyls? If we covete to withdraw our minds from the redious cares of this
liffe / why seake we any other delectable pastymes? why had we lever learn the
wisdom of Christ's doctrine out of me^nes books / then of christ him silfe?
Which in this scripture does chefly perform that thing which he promised
unto ^s when he said / that he would con^ynew with us unto the end of world.
For in this his testament he speaks / bretheth / and lyveth among us / in a
manner more effectuallye / then when his body wa^ presently conversante in this
world. The Jews nether saw n^ heard so much. As thou may daily both here
and se in the scripture of Christ / there wants nothing / but that thou
bring the hears and eyes of faith where with he may be hard and perceaved.
What a mervelous world is this? We keep the letters which are written from
our frynde. We kiss them / and ^ere them about with us. We read them over
twyse or thryse: And how many thousands are there among the Christen which
are extemed of great litterature / And yet have not once in their lyv^s Read
ove^ ^he Gosple^ and Epistles of the Apostle^. Mahumete^ adhere^tes are all
well instruct in their own sect / And the Jews unto this day even from
their tender age study diligently their Moses / Why do not we soch honor unto
Christ embrasinge his precepts which bring eternal liffe? They that
profess saint Benedictes institution (which is a rule both made of a man that
was but of small learning and also written unto the seculare / rude / and
unlearned) observe their example / learn it by heart / and drink it in to
their hearts. Saint Austyns adherentes are not ignorant in their rule / Saint
Franciskes friars do know observe / and avaunce their patrones precepts / ye
and carye them about with them whether so ever they go Insomoche that they
think not them selves in savete except their book be with them. Why set they
more by their rule which was written of a man then the hole Christente by the
holy scripture / which Christ did equallye preach unto all men / which we have
all professed in baptime? And to conclude / which is most holy among all other
doctrines / and none to be compared with it / all though thou hepe sex hundredth
to gedder / and I would to god y^ as Paul did write that the law of Moses had
no glory in comparison to the glory of the gospel that succeeded after it /
that even so the evangelyes and epistles were extemed of the Christen so holy
or had in soch reverence / that the doctrynes o^ men in respect of them
might scame nothing holy / I am co^te^te that everye man avaunce his doctor
at his own pleasure / let the^ extolle Albarte / Alexander / Saint Thomas /
Aegidius / Richard / and Occam / I will diminysshe no manes fame no glory /
Another yet resist and reprove the old manner of study / Let them be wittye /
sotle / And in a manner above capacyte or angelic all / yet truly must they
needs knowledge that these are most true / undoubted / and fruitful. Paul and
saint Johan will that we judge the spretes of prophets whether they are of
god or not / and Saint Augustyne readinge all other men's books with judgment
/ requirethe none another authoryte to his bokys Only in the scripture when he
can not attain a thing / he submits him sylf unto it / And our doctor
(which is Christ) was not allowed by the scoles of devines / but of the hevenly
father his own and goodly voice beringe wytnes / and that twyse / first at
Iodane as he was baptized / and after in his tra^sfiguratio^ on the mount
thabor / sayeinge / This is my welbeloved son in whom I am pleased / hear
you him O this sure au^horyte: which (as they say) has no co^tradictio^ /
what signifies this / hear you him: Truly that he is only the true teacher
and instructore / and that we ought only to be his disciples. Now let every man
with their hole affection praise their authors as much as they will / yet was
this voice with out^ nay only spoken of Christ our savyoure / upon whom
descended the holy ghost in likeness of a dove which did confirm the
testimonye of the hevenly father. With this ^prete was Peter endued unto whom
the high shepard Christ / committed his sheep once / twyse ye thryse to be fed
and noryss^ed / meaning truly no another thing but that he should instruct
them / with the hevenly fode of Christian doctrine. In Paul / Christ seemed in
a manner newborn again / whom he him silf called a chosen wessel / and a pure
p^eacher of his name and glory. Saint Johan expressed in his learning that
thing which he had souked or drunk out of the holy fontayne of Christ^s
boosome. What like think is there in dun^ (I would not you should think that I
speak it of ennye) what like thing is there in saint Th^mas? how be it I
commend this man's ^olinesse / Ind mervell at the so^le wit and judgment of
the other. Why do we not all apply our diligente study in these great
authors / I mean Christ / Peter / Paul / and Johan? Why bear we not about
these in our bosoms? Why have we them not ever in our hands? Why do we not
hu^te / seek / and search out these things with a curious diligence? Why geve
we a greater portion of our liffe to the study of Averrois / then to the
Eva^gely of Christ? why do we (in a manner) consvine al our age in the decrees
of men / and vain opinions which are so contrary and dissentinge among them
selves? Be it in case they be great devines that made soche const^^utions yet
notwithsta^dinge only in Christ's word consists the exercise / and invrance
/ of him which before god is reputed for a great devine. It is mete that we
all which have professed the name of Christ (at the least if we have promised
with mind and heart) that we be instruct with ^the doc^ryne of Christ / being
yet tender infantes in our parents arms / and wanton child^^n at our nurses
tete / for it is empre^ted most deep / And cleveth most surely / which the rude
and unformed shelle of our soul do the first receave and learn. I would our
first and unformed speech should soun / de of Christ / I would our ignora^te
childhed should be informed with Christ's eva^^elye / and to the^ I would Christ
should be so swetely taught / ye they might be enflamed to love him / And that
after they should proceed by a little and a little crepinge by the grovnde until
that by insensible incrementes they spring up to be strong in Christ. Other
me^nes traditions are soche / that many repent them selves because they have
spente so much study and labor upon them. And often it chances that they
which have most manfully fought through all their liffe even unto the death /
to defend men's doctrines and decrees / Yet in the point of death have cast
away their shilde / and have clean dissented from their authors sect. But
blissed is he whom death assayleth / if his heart be hole occupied in this
wholesome doctrine. Let us therefore all with fervent desire thriste after these
sprituall spriges / Let us embrace them. Let us be studiously conversante with
the^. Let us kiss these sweet words of Christ with a pure affection Let us be
new tranformed in^to them for soche are our manners as our studyes be ye (and
to be short) let us dye in them he that can not attain them (but who is he
that can not if he will him silf) yet at the least let him submit him silfe
unto the^ recountinge the^ very holy / and as ye storehouse / or tresurye / of
gods own mide from whence comes furthe all goodness. If a man would show us a
step of Christ's foot / Good lord / how would we knele and worshuppe it? And
why do we nor rather honor his qwycke and lyvelye image which is most
expresslye contained in these books? If a man would bring unto us Christ's
coo^e whether would we not run hedlynge that we might once kiss it? How be it
if thou bring out his coote / sherte / shoes / and all his house old stuff /
yet is there nothing that does more truly and expressly represente Christ /
then the gospels and epistles. We garnisshe or adorn an image of wod or stone
with gold and precious stones for the love of Christ. But why are not these
things rather garnisshed with gold and gemmes / ice and more preciously / if
so any thing can be more precious then they / sith they represent much more
presentlye Christ unto us / then any image ca^ do? As for images / what thing
can they express but the figure of his body? if they express that. But the
evangely does represent and express the qwicke and levinge image of his most
holy mind / ye and Christ him silf speakinge / healinge / deyenge / rysinge
again / and to conclude all parts of him. In so much that thou couldeste not
so plain and frutefullye see him / All though he were present before thy
bodlye eyes.

Amen.
THe cause why the apostle did write this present chapter was this. The
Corinthia^s which did receave the doctrine of Christ and so did become his
servantes / and specially they which before had followed ye Jews ways / did
observe both the Euangely / and also the law of Moses. Now had Moses
commanded that every man should be married. So that a man by the law of
matrimony should be associate and keep company with a woman / and the woman
with a man^ To lyve several or single was the^ condemned / as a state baren
and unfruitful. The cause was this. God had promised in the old testamente
that Christ should descend of the seed of Abraham. Now did no body yet know
what parsones were the seed that should begette him. It was therefore
necessaryly required that the Hebrews all / which were Jews should be
coniugate in marriage for honor and love of this seed / and to engendre
children until the advente and cominge of Christ.

For this cause did the Corinthyans demand / whether they were bound to
keep the aforesaid law? And whethere yt was ^efulle for them to abide and
lyve unmarried / when they had love and desyer unto chastity? And most
specially for so much as by reasone of the euangely many other laws were
cassate / and anulled / and put unto man's liberty to keep them / or else
not to keep them. Their feeble and weyke consciences cowde uneaths leave the
law of Moses / where unto they had so long time and many ages been
accustomed. Unto this does saint Paul here make them answer saing that this
is not only lefulle / but also good and profitable / if so a man minds to
lyve chaste / and has love and delight to the same. Not with standinge he does
here intr^ate of this matter both diligently and also warely / ^^xtynge and
intermedlinge all ways matrimony.

It is good for a man not to^ touch a woman. Nevertheless to avoyde
fornicacyon. Let every man have his wife. And let every woman have her husband.
Consider well the words / and behold how shortly he breaks of / making
digression from his first sentence. Yt is says he good / if a man do not
touch a woman. But in this he does another bydde / ne forbid any man so for
to do / but incontinent he hyeth him unto matrimony. As if he did fear soche a
good thing to be rare and vnwonte / and that in time cominge would turn and
be changed into fornicacyon. Afferminge that for love of avoydinge fornicacyon
every man ought to have his wife Therefore this is his first sentence or
conclusion. That whosoever in him silfe does not feel this godly and good
thing I mean chastity: but does feel and perceave incontinency / Unto him (I
say) is here commandment gyven / that he be married. And this commaundeme^te
oughteste thou to rec^ave as the commandment of God and not of man. Then here
of does follow that no parsone may make a vow or promise to lyve chaste and
single. And that no parson is bound to keep and perform any such vow once
made / but rather to fordo vnkepe and break them. When in him silfe he does
not find nor feel this precious and goodly gift of chastity / but knows him
sil^e prone to lust and incontinencye. For such a vow is plainly made
against this commandment. But against the commandment of God may no
vow be made therefore if any such vow be made / he that shall observe and
k^pe ^t is damnabyll / ye and by the law of god all redye condemned.

This thouchynge of women have some parsones diffined and compased much
straytly. So yt they dare not touch a woman's hand nor skin. Moreover they
have found and imagined many both statutes and ceremonies / by which they
might keep the^ selves from the company of women. So yt they should another s^e
nor hear them / supposinge that by such meanys they have made royal
provision to lyve chaste / and unmarried. And thus they that first did byld^
monasteryes and abbyes thought that young men might be kept pure and chaste /
if they ware absente from young women / and likewise young women from me^. But
unto what prefe and how fortunatly that thing has come to pass / and what
place th^rby has been geven to Satan / it were horrible both to be spoken /
and also to be heard of.

Such parsones be as men are wont to say commonly more blind then a betle.
They wene that chastyte may be dryve^ in to a man by outward means. When not
whithsta^ding / this high and hevenly gift must spring out from the inner
parts of the heart. For all if yt be manifestly known that lust is inflammed
when man and woman do come to gether / Yet have they therefore not made all
gates so royal a provision against lust / as they pretend / in that they
are kept separate from women / and the women from men / for what avayleth me
to see no woman / ne hear / another yet touch her? if my heart swymme fulle of
them? if in thought it cleveth un to them both day and night? If it ymagine
and purpose more fylthines / then any man is bold to do? And what does it
profit to sperre and close in a young woman / that she can have no liberte
another to see ne hear a young man / when her heart with out ceasinge does
morn and sygh after such one both days and nyghtes?

The heart must be geven unto chastity. Else all our enforsemente labor and
diligence shall be unto us grevous and paynfull as hell and other like
torments. Wherefore this saying of Paul must needs be understand in sorete
and in heart / on this wise. That he shall be said not to touch a woman /
which with desire of his heart / and with his own p^oper will does outwardly
keep his body from women. And not he that is compelled outwardly to abstain or
keep from women / inwardly in heart being fulle of lust and love toward
them. But such are dissembl^rs and hypocrites / whose clennes and chastity
glistereth before the world / but before god it is lost and damnable / ye it
is doble lecherye / for saint paul's saying is freely spretuall. Wherefore it
requires a fre sprete / and in a fre sprete it must be taken and received.
But hypocrytes receave yt grudginly / making thereof a dedde letter / and a
grevous law / that d^yveth and co^pelleth the^. And so they make damnable and
feigned chastity by outward shunni^ge and avoidi^ge from women dolorous and
paynfulle. Mark now whatkyn soulesleers they be which so entise and provoke
folisshe youth to vow outward chasti^e causinge and compellinge them to
norisshe with in them inwardly hydden malice and evyll / taking no
co^syderacio^ with them selves / whether the parsones whom they thus do entyse
and move be like wise with heart and desyer sturred unto the same / that is to
wytt unto chastity or single livinge. But the more hard and paynfull yt is to
man / the more noble and precious do they wene that yt is before god like wise
as yt is wont to be in other exterio: hurtes / da^mages / and vexacio^s of ye
body. And they do not see yt this evil of strayned and vnwill full co^tine^cy
/ and exterior pain or grefe of the body be no less differente then heven and
earth. For as touching other evilles / and gresis they may be endured and
suffered with a meri conscience with out sin / and they do pain the body
only But this evil and troble is subject and in dawnger of sin. Be cause yt
can in no wise be endured with a merry conscience. For yt is sin and unright
wisnes in yt selfe^ Wherefore this evil of vnwilfull chastity can by no
medicine be helped and healed / onles when a man is rid from dawnger ofsinne.
Which can be by no another ways then by the healpe and remedy of marriage. But
other exterior grefes or trobles concerning man's body may be helped by
patience / allthough a man be never rid from them.

And in this manner wills saint Paul that saying to be understand. Yt is
good for a man not to touch a woman etc. So that this word / good / be not
understand ne spoken of merit and deservinge before god. As though an
unmarried body were better a fore him tha^ one yt is married like as before time
saint Hierome has this text expowned. For yt concerns only faith / and no
deed or work. And yt is spoken of temporalle tranquillite / and quietness of
this life. Which a single or unmarried parsone has before one that is wedded
and maried^ For one that is single shall be quite and free from all miseries /
vexacion / and drudgery / that befalle in wedloke or marriage. And for to tell
you shortly yt is a ioyfulle lovely precious and goodly gift (if so a man has
yt verily given him) to ^yve with a glad heart and mind syngle and chaste.
But Paul him sylfe shall here after excelle^tly descrybe unto you what he
entendeth by such goodness. For yt was not syttyng for him that so did
commend virginite and syngle livynge / to leave them with out consolacyon /
which there unto were geven with their very mind and will. Nevertheless this
must you gravnte me / that a wife and married woman may be better before god
thean a vyrgyn. All be yt she in her state do suffer many^ pains tobles and
adversytes / and the virgyn or maid has much joy and tranquillyte /
passing her age in rest and quyetnes.

Therefore this is the sentence or meaning of Paul / Yt is good for a man not
to touch a woman. Another is yt any offense now in the time of the new
testamente to lyve with out a wife and chyldre / as yt was in the time of the
old testamente / but yt is good as here witnesses Paul for a man not to
touch a woman. That is to say. A man unto whom is geve^ of god / that he ca^
gladly with his very heart and will abide syngle / the same man may lead a
quiet life. This does report the common proverbes / that me^ use to speak.
Such as be these / Be thou married o fool (does on say unto an other) and thy
joy shall shortly have an end. Also / marriage is a short joy and a long
sorrow / and such other like. Which all do well agree with this place of
Paul / Yt is good for a man not to touch a woman. Therefore did Moses also
commawnde in the law that a man newly married should be quyte and fre from all
public charges by the space of an whole year / yt he might have joy and make
merry with his wife / another should he be called to goo in warfare / another to
bear any charge or office. As though Moses should say / he shall lyve a year
in gladness / and after he shall suffer troble sorrow and angwysshe.

But if yt be not geve^ a man to lyve with his very heart and mind chaste or
unmarried. Yt is better for him to take a wife to be his co^panyon. Ye there is
no thing else at all left or remayninge / that may ease and healpe the /
except honest and chaste matrimony. Wherefore where it is not geven a man to
enjoy and use the co^modytes of syngle livinge and chastity. It is necessary
to geve him silf unto the troble / pay^^es / and vexations of marriage. For it
is always better to lead a miserable or sorry life with out sin in marriage /
then to lyve joyfully in the foul sin of lecherye unmarried. But there is no
body that will gladly put them selves into such pains and sorinesse. And
therefore does well nygh every man for his part abhor wedlock. Wherefore it
is a common used by word. He must be hardye that shall mary a wife. And with
out fail he had need to be very hardye Another is there / any parsone that
leveth more blessydly or quietly then a pure christian / which being led and
gyded by faith can so fassion him sylfe again trobles and stormy seasons of
aduersyte / that he does no whit complain / another cry / ne blaspheme god and
his word: Like as do the mad and blindewise men of this world.

Thus does saint Paul here mean in this place / when he so suddenly after the
co^mendacion and praise of chastity returns unto marriage saying / but to
avoyde fornication / let every man have his wife / and let every woman have
her husband. What does he entende in that he says / but to avoyde
fornicacio^? No thing verily else / but where as such manner quietness is not
/ that a man can willingly lyve chaste / that then he should wait after no
thing more surely to follow or to come / then fornicacion and lecherye.
Wherefore if the gift of chastity do lack / yt is better to be with out the
pleasure and profytes of chastyte / and to gyve him self unto the miseryes /
trobles / and pains of matrimony / for avoydi^ge of sin. For yt is always
more profitable to have pain grefe / and yrkesumnes / with out sin / then to
have sin with out pa^ne / greve and y^kesumnes. Ye the^ to have sin
jointly to gether with these three.

Take head here un to the words of Paul / which does not hope^that much
castite should be in the Corinthians. Chastity truly is a right good thing /
if so lust and incontinency makes not chastity so vulgar and commone a
thing for all parsonis as we have hitherto used to do / and as yet we do / but
all amiss. But he will that universally all men be coniugate in matrimony. And
yet not with standinge he being endued and inspired with te sprete of good did
without dowte know more parfitely the nature / disposition / power and
inclinacion of man then all the Bishopes that has been since his time which
has stroyed fordone and let this godly institucion and ordinance. So that
this saying of saint Paul with them does bear no place. But in this do they
now rail and B^ble in pulpites. Yt is lawfulle for some men to have wifes /
and for some yt is not lawfulle. Thus do they chawnge the latin word. Quisqzin
to quidam / that is to say every man in to some man. But as concerning this
thing you shall see more plenteously here under. Saint Paul now proceeds
forthe^

Let the man geve unto the wife due benevolence / likewise also the wife unto
the man. The wife has not power over her own body: but the husband. And like
wise the man has not power over his own body / but the wife.
Paul in this place does instruct them that are coupled in matrimony how and
in what manner they on both par^yes should be ordered / and demean themselves in
their state of wedlock / which he does here call due benevolence. It is truly
a thing due / but not with standinge it ought to be willingly done and
performed. In that he says it is due / he tells the cause why God does
permit unto matrimony / and pardone that / which else from with out it / he
does punisshe and condemn.

For in this point is matrimony closed in the laws of love / that another the
ma^ne the wife has power of their own body / but the one is bownde to serve
ye other by ye law of love. Which thing in fornication and advoutry has no
place / where as another party has power apo^ ye other / another is ye one
bownde ne owes any thing unto ye other but both of the^ do seek their own
pleasures. Wherefore also soch unclean and dishoneste love is contrary unto god.
Yt is verily ^ great saying / that another party has power over their own
body. So that if at any time lust and concupiscence does te^pte them the one
is then bownde to assent^ and follow the desyer of the other / and not to geve
them sylves unto any other. In this does manifestly appear how that
advoutrye is the greateste theft and robberye of all that is in the world.
For who so ever does commit^e yt / geveth his lively body / where apo^ he has
no power unto an other: and takes also a way a lively body where upon he like
wise has no power.

More over Paul's words be here manyfeste / and do not need much exposicion.
Another dare I now here search ye pryvetyes of marriage / to write of the^ any
dishonest or unclean thing. A right Christian shall here know by him sylfe /
how yt shall become him to order behave him sylfe measurably. Another makes it
any matter how so ever a wicked and vng^dly body be enflamed and rage Some old
men have used this Paganes by word. He that burns overmoche in love / is
made an adoutrer in his own wife. But by cawse it is a paganes saying /
carnal and lecherous parsones cares not much therefore. And I say verily
that it is contrary un to the truth / for no man does commit advoutry in his
own wife / except he other refuse to have her / or else to use her as his
wife.

And I think that this matter can not be better discussed and entrated of /
then it is here of Paul / which affirms that marriage is only savegarde and
remedy again lecherye. Wherefore that parsone which uses it / to avoyde and do
away fornication I dare suerly say that he has Paul for his advocate and
defender. Her^of may I justly gather that it stands not well to gehter another
is it Christ's learning that the man and the wife (like as we see used in some
places) should abide separate ne come to gether after the example of Toby
until the third night.

I do admit that every man may use ^e same manner / if so he please with the
assent of his wife: but to think that he is bound thereto So that if he do
follow it / he does a meritorious deed: or else if he leave it undone / or do
contrary wise / that is to say / if he do use his wife before that third
night / he should therefore sin / and do amiss. Then I say this man in very
deed thinks evyll and does amiss. Not because he did use his wife contrary
to such a folishe gyse as is before showed: but for that he has a wrong
informed conscience. And finally soche thoughts / and opinions or y^^ginacyons
or scrupulous and void of right beleve / and coming of a conscience evyll
encombred / or as Paul says in the first pistle to Timothe.uij. Marked with
an hot yeron.

For if the example of Thoby be of such great authorite and power / why shall
not the example of Jacob the Patriarch be of more / which did touch / and
know Lya his wife in ye first night? This ought therefore to be fre / and in
mannys lyberty. They dote and play the foles / that in these matters do lay
snarys and make laws or bonds. The wife has power over the husband / but
over her own body she has none. And like wise is yt of the husband. Here
ought men therefore to stinte of their statutes and ordinances maki^ge: for a
better ordinance the^ this can none be brought / ye me^ with out any respect
of soche time shall use there wifes (like as god permits) accordi^ge as they
like and have necessite / forthermore they have exempte certain days as those
which we do call vygilles and holy evyns / also women conceaved with child.

I grawnte well that yt were much profitable and necessary that in all things
were none excess / or any thing done immeasurably: Yet nevertelesse ought he^^
not to be made any vrgente law that should bind men of necessyte to refrain.
And these words of Paul ought to be left true which does afferme that another
party has power over their own body / other in this / or yet in any other
day how so ever god sends it. And by this way has saint Paul ente^ded to
oppress and put down fornication / and to cut away all occasions of the
same. O what a multitude of laws does this little saying of Paul fordo and
anulle / when he says that another party has power over their own bodies?
Ye I say to you more over that it can not suffer nor abide any law. For how
shall any man by any law forbid me from that body that is geven me both by
the law / and also by power divine? The grant of god is more than the
commandments or laws of all men. That which he has geven and granted me
/ ought not saint Peter pulle fro me / and much less our holy father /
which (I put it to your judgment) how rightewesly he reioyseth and clepeth
him self Peter's successor / and vicar / and how directly he follows his
steps or learning.

With draw not your selves one from an other / except it be by co^sente for a
time / for to geve your selves unto fasting and prayer / and afterward come a
gain unto the same thing / lest Satan tempte you for your incontine^cy
That Paul had ^ut little trust at all in the Corinthians / that they should
lyve chaste the cause was this / he did know the devil / his snaris / and
sculkewatche / and also the weakness or frailte of the flesh. Here you se
that married folks are so mightily knitte and coniugate to gether that one
ought not to absente or wythdrawe the^ selves from the other with out they both
consent. No not for cause of fasting nor of prayer. So yt he had rather
prayer and fasting to be let pass and undone / then one of then should
absente their bodies from the other. Prayer vndowetedly is an high and a
precious deed. Nevertheless it must of duty geve place unto this / which (as
it does seame) is so ^^le a deed. And all this does cause ye law of love in
which they be coupled and joined: fasting and prayer owght to be here
understand of fasting and prayer that are taken ordrely and distinctely after
duty required in marriage / as when the husband and the wife after they have been conversante the one with the other and have had to do to gether according
after the course of nature / then do ordeyne with agreabille consent to geve
them selves.iij.iiij.vj. or.xiiij. days unto prayer and abstihence. Like as
also e^very parsone may for himselve take apo^ the^ such fasting for to
chastyse y^ body Else ^hey that are married / as well as other chri^tian people
be bound by the tenor of the Euangely unto fasting and to prayer / for
Christ spoke indifferently unto all people. That they should pray continually
with out cessinge. This fasting is mesurabyll usage of meats and drinks. And
prayer is a criyng sigh / desyer / and morninge.

That in our englisshe text we do here read / withdraw not you selves one
from an other / it sowndeth rather after the Greek and laten examples / if it
should be translate word for word: defraude you not or deceave you not one an
other. Nevertheless our englisshe text does right well and expressly show
the sense and meaning of this place / like as it does excellently well of all
other points. For a man or a woman that is married for avoiding of fornicacyon
has no power over their own bodies. But the wife has power over the body of
her husband / and like wise has the man the same power over his wife. So that
if the one should withdraw them selves from the other / deniyng them their
bodies to use according to natural usage / permitted unto marriage / it is
undoubted that they should so defraude them / and do them wrong.

Also this natural usage of my body is before called due benevolence that
Paul ^ litell before bids every man to geve unto his wife. If I therefore
should wythdrawe me or deny it. I should wythdrawe that is my duty to geve.
And that were no thing else but fraud and deceate. So that you have here
clearly showed before your eyes that such wythdrawing is very fraud / and no
thing else. This have I showed you / that you should not lack any knowledge
other of this place or yet of any other / yt I by the grace of god can help
you unto. And moreover to blanke and confownde our pharisees and enemies of
the truth. Which if they ones hear that I do interpret this place other
wise then it stands written in the englisshe translacyon of the testamente /
should parave^ture begin to rail / sklaunder / and speak evyll (as it is
not unlike but they will / for such both is and ever has been their nature
and demeaner) of me / and of the good man which did it translate saiynge. Lo
they contrary themselves on an other / how mad therefore ar ye to beleve them?
Therefore less yt you should be trobled by such deceavable reasons and
arguments I have showed you by reasons manyfeste / and authorite sufficient
that we do not vary / ne contrary one an other. But that he using this word
wythdrawe / does both well interpret or translate / and by so translatynge
also notably and plainly does expound what is naturally signified by the greek
and laten examples which if they were translate in to englisshe / word for
word should be as I have told you before thus much to say: ^efraude you not
on an other. And this fraud is when a man withdraws hi^ from his wife / or
the wife from her husband.

What the causes of this fraud or withdrawing might be / can I not show you
so well / as they that have had experience. Nevertheless I can lightly beleve
that there be diverse causes / as is sitting for that state / which is ordained
for the time of troble and adversite / and not only for time of pleasure / and
prosperity. In this state does often times arise anger / variance and debate.
And other whil^s does here in reign chosen or angelicast holiness (as saint
Paul calls it) and devocion. But Paul does here show only one cause / why
ye one party maye^ withdraw them from the other for a seasone. And other more
like as I ought not to put / so also ought none other man.

The cause which saint Paul shows / is that two married persons may
consent to abide severalle a few days the one from the other to tame and
chastise their flesh by special or singular ceremonies as fasting and
fervente prayer / specially if so at any time neade does require / for strong
and mighty prayer requires strong and mighty abstinence or fasting. Not wi^h
standinge Paul leaves this free and puts it unto man's will and liberte.
Another does he thereof ordeyne or make any law / but dimitteth^ it unto the
consent of the^ both. Wherefore no man ought to enforse and compelle me^ unto
this fasting and prayer by laws / as they have before time hither to been wont
to do / he does now take for hi^. ii^ states of chastity. The state of widows
/ the state of wedded persons / and the state of maids or virgins. And so
consequently does show / what is necessary in them^to be known saien^e.

This I say of favor / not of co^maundeme^te / for I would that all me^ were
as I my silfe am. But every man has his proper gift of god / one after this
manner / an other after that.
Before he speaks after the manner of a commandment savenge / for to
advoyde fornicacyon let every man have his wife. etc And let a man geve unto
the wife due benevolence. How therefore does he in this place say that he
speaks these things not of commandment / but of favor? With out doubt he
wills marriage to be a free thing so that no man should be compelled to bind
himself there unto / like as they did in the time of the old testame^te.
Wherefore he co^mawndeth no man to be married / but grants yt / unto every man
that lusts to be married. But when ^hey be onys coupled in marriage / he geveth
commawndeme^te that they do the^ geve the one unto ye other due beneuole^ce.
Moreover where as is not the gyf^e of grace that thou may freely geve the
unto matrimony / or not gyve the / that is to say when thou canste not leve
purely unmarried and that both in mind and body / then is matrimony unto the
co^mawnded / ye and more then commawnded.

But what means he in that he says I would that all me^ were as I my sylfe
am. Is not this spoken against matrimony / as though he would have no body
coniugate in the bo^de of matrimony?^ He wyssheth verily yt the precious gift
of chastity were geven unto every body / that they might be void of the
t^oblesome and sorry ^ares angvysshe and vexacio^s of marriage / and inte^de
gladly with their free mind / and all study unto god only and unto his word:
which gift was geve^ unto him. Is there any parsone that would not wysshe
unto every man this gift? For christyan charity wyssheth unto all me^ all good
things both of this world present / and good things of the world to come
And yt has none assygned or certain me^e and bownde of well doing and of well
wysshi^ge. All be yt the thing which yt wyssheth do seem impossible. Wherefore
in ye.ix. chapyter of the pystle unto the Romans he wissheth to be cursyd from
Christ for his b^etherne. But every man (says he) has his proper gift of
god / one after this manner / an other after that. Here he knowledgeth that his
wysshe and desyer can not be fulfilled / and that god will not geve unto every
man this gift. And this text would I that thou shuldeste put and lay up for
store in the inner par^yes of thine heart. Yt comprehends many things / and
commends matrimony no less then chastyte. For if a man compare marriage with
chastyte. Chastyte verily is a more excellen^e gift. Nevertheless matrimony
(as in this passage shows saint Paul (is the gyf^e of god like as is
chastity. The man also is more excelle^te then the woman / nevertheless she is
the work and creature of god / as well as he is. Before god all things be
like and equalle / which notwith standing if they be compared to gether the
one with the other / they be differente and unlike. What so ever thing god did
make / ye same does call him their maker lord and creator. Another does one
thing call and name him so more excelle^tly then an other / be yt little
thing / or else great. Eve^ so ar like in value before hi^ matrimony and
virgini^^ / for either other of them / is the gift and creature of god / all
though the on excels and surmounteth the other / if so a man does lay them
to gether and confer the^ betwyxte them selves.

By this does clearly appear how abhominably they do sin / which make
nonnes swelle in pride / when they babble that there holy religyon is more
precious before god than matrimony / and they feign that every Nonne shall have
a croune / or a garlende of gold and precious stones / and soch like other I
can not tell what prerogatives and dignites do they dream that nonnes shall
have above other parsones. Through which lies do they make such folk proud /
arrogante / wicked and vnfaythfulle / and to put mor trust in their deeds and
ceremonies / then they put faith in Christ and in gods grace / so dispisyng
matrimony as a thing many miles before the sight of god more base / and less
in valewe then chastity. And they do call the^ selves the faithful spo^ses of
our savioure Jesus Christ / ye they be the sponses of Satan / In that they do
use chastity not unto the entente / unto the which only yt was orden^d / that
is to wit / not that a man should be the mor excellent or better before god:
but that it makes the^ ye more ready and more apt to the study and love of the
word of god / and learning ^her of the^ does matrimony.

Forasmoche therefore as both of them is the gift of god. And matrimony is as a
co^mone gift geven unto many. But chastity is a singular and an vnwonte gift
granted unto very few. Yt is here in showed that every man ought to examine
him self / whether he fyndeth whith in him / this co^mone and vulgar or ellis
this selde and singular giste. But because saint Paul does here manifes^ly
conclude that chastity is a gift of god / yt shall be necessary^for us to
knowledge that it is not our power. And therefore ca^ no man another promise ner
vow it / ne keep it. For I ca^ not promise the goods and gifts of god /
onles he before has geven them unto me: or else I be certain of his promise /
that he will geve them unto me / like as Hieremy was certain and assured.
Therefore we read none example at all / of any vow in the scripture / except
in these things which were geven us before or ellis sone after should be geven
/ as it is showed Numeri.xxx. of howses / lands / money / catelle / abstinence
/ and other chastisinges or disciplines of our bodies?

Therefore seeing yt we be end^tyn^e this place / where Paul does so largely
praise and commend matrimony / and calls it the gift of god / we will
entreat of it the more amply and tarry the longer in yt / entendinge to declare
you how that matrimony is of all other the most highest relygion and most
spretuall estate / And more over to prove unto you suerly and clearly that the
sects of all them / whom men use to call relygious / and of all manner
shavelynges are falsely called spretuall ordres. But matrimony is (as they
say) a secul^re and an unholy estate. How be yt that saying or calling ought
to be ch^unged and turned So that matrimony ought to be called (like as in very
deed it is) a right spretuall estate / And other ordres should (even as verily
they are) be called wordly and seculare estates They have brought up nothing
else in the world then perverse abusyons of names and words / wherwyth they
have anointed men's mouths / and begyled all the world: in such wise that
yt / which is secular shall be called spretuall / and a spretuall thing must
be called secular.

First you shall know that yt were profitable and needful that nothing were
called after the name of the sprete / except only the inner life of faith /
which is in the heart / where as the sprete h^th rule and dominyon.
Nevertheless for because that thing is also called spretuall / which is
outwardly wrought / and done by ye sprete of faith in ye me^bres of ye body /
we shall here not only see / but also (as a man would say) manifestly feale
with our hands / yt matrimony ought most rightwisly of all other be called a
spretuall estate. And ye other ordres should be called secular wordly lay (as
they use to say) and unholy estates. I speak of these ordres and religious
parsones / which have suffered themselves to be called and magnifyed by this
name spretuall un tylle this day. But they which walk in the right way by
faith a^^ ar truly spretuall / these have the very state of contynencye.
Moreover this can no man deny that the works / deeds / goods / and
possessions of them which ar called spre^ua^l be like wise exteryo^ /
temporalle / transitory and corporalle / as be the works / and other things
of the married persons. For they be done in like wise by the body and members
or instruments of the same / as be the things before said which belong unto
them that are married. For what so ever thing is done by the body / and lymmes /
or instruments of yt / must needs be corporall^ and exterior / ye and the
cou^selles or thoughts of y^ heart ought by reason of these soche ou^warde and
corporalle deeds both be in very deed and also be called corporalle. But if yt
be co^venye^t yt any state should be called spretualle some other gretter thing
is there unto requisyte / the^ soche exteri^r deeds and ceremonies That is to
wit faith in heart which does come of the sprete / and makes all thing that
is in man / as well with out as with in spretualle.

Consider also now our holy religions / which before time until now have been
famous and magnifyed / and thou shall find / first that they be in the b^ste
wise s^ored and provided for / as co^cerninge things necessary unto their
levi^ge Beside forth they are assured of their rentes / and revenues of meat /
drink / clothes / beddinge / houses / and of all other things / and that
most plenteously / gotten unto their hands by other me^nes sweet and labor /
ye brought home unto them / and put before their nose. So that they another be /
ne will be in any doubt or perille / as concerning for these things. No
parsone is thus spretualle ne minds for to be / except he know before that
he should have abu^dantly / of all these things / and all his life long. O
lord god what an innumerable multitude / and thronge is there in cloisters /
and also among prystes that seek and appete this / that is to say to lyve
welthyly ^asely / without labor in ydelnes (and as they call it) to live like
a gentilman / ye to live fylb^lyes and belly beste^ / farcinge their hyde and
stuffinge their paunches.

What other thing else is this / then to seek that state / wherein is no
labor / and not t^ have need to lift ones their yes up in to heven / to look
after their daily bredde / ne to trust in god that he should norisshe and
feade them? I will tell you at one word / faith in ^hese estates and
conditions of men has no place ne space / ne time / ne work / ne use or
exercise. For they be drouned in ple^te and abundance of poss^ssions and
worldely goods. Another is there any confidence of things which ar hoped for
/ but a certain holding fast and assurance of things present.

But if thou shal^e mary a wife / and be coniugate in matrimony. The first
tentation (where with thou are incontinente assailed) is how thou shalt now
maintene thy wife and bring up thy children? this assaute of tentation endures
all thy life long. So that marriage of the own nature is soche a thing / that
does both teach and also drives the to have respect / and look unto the
grace of god / and in manner enforseth the unto faith. And thus in matrimony we
do see / that if faith be wantinge that it is an hard paynfulle / and a
miserable state / fulle of care angwisshe and labor. And contrary wise how
much the less faith the noble estates spretualle (as they use to call them)
has / the more ioyfulle and blessed days do they lead or live. For they have
royally provided for their belly / and have no need to look unto the hand of
god nor abide his goodness.

Show me therefore whether of these states ought of right to be called
spretualle. Think you no^ that this in which men have need of faith / and in
which faith knows her works / and has her daily exercise and has cause to
trust in god / according to the sentence of yt.ciij. psalm / where is said
in this wise The eyes of all do trust in ye lord / and thou do geve them
meat in time convenient. Thou openeste thy hand and fyllest every lyvinge
creature with thy blessinge?

Therefore only matrimony has these causes / occasions / and ex^rcises to
trust unto god Another can our spretualle estates be known by any of the^ /
for they be so stablisshed founded / and fensed / yt they ca^ utterly feel none
of these occasions. And thus have they driven out faith / and stopped up all
holes / or creues / yt ^t may in no wise come in unto the^. Is it not therefore
a wicked presumpcio^ to boste the^ selves to be spretualle / and to avaunce
their states to be in likewise sp^etualle / in which no^ with standing of
their ^wne nature ca^ verily not ^e yt lest drop of faith? So that the
sprete add such spretuall states has no more agremente / then Christ and
Beliall / the day and the night / the sprete and the flesh / faith and our
senses or reason / for where faith is not / ne place nor ^ccasyon of the same /
there can the sprete not be / but all must needs be carnalle / worldely and
corporalle / like as by experience is manifestly showed in our religious
folk. Agaynewarde they defame matrimony as a worldely secular and carnalle
thing. And they do not mark / that it was so ordened of god that it should as
who would say in manner bring one half by compulsion / and violence unto the
sprete and faith. So that commonly there must needs be a pure sprete / where as
is a good / and p^osperous marriage. For that which is the work or creature of
god is so ordained / that it must proceed in faith and exercise or inu^^nge
the same. which is in s^ff^^a^ce of troble and adv^rsitees But that which is
found / or made by man has always pros^erous fortune and succession by cause
yt is with out faith. For such appeteth always to be certain and in assurance
of things there unto belonginge.

First do thou thus here in see yt matrimony is of soche nature / and
properte yt it in manner straineth / enforseth / and drives one unto the
inward and most spretuall work / that is to wit faith / for no work is
higher / more inward / and more spretualle then faith. It rests and hangs
upon the pure and bare word of God / and is delivered quyte from all thing /
that is not the levinge word of Christ Jesus. But there can be no thing higher
or more inner another in heven / ne inerth then the word of God / which is
verily even God him silfe.

Contrary wise these spretuall estates of their own nature be soche that they
allure a man unto welthe and pleasures / and cause him to spend him silfe all
to gether about the getinge of temporalle and exterior things / yt as
partaininge for his body he may lack nothing. And thus he refuses plainly
to be spretuall / except he might have abundance of outward things / and be
of them assured / less he should at ^nytime misture / and have need of faith
or trust in god. So that thou must plainly confess that this spretuall
estate of the own kind / and nature does belong unto erthly / seculare / and
worldely things / and that i^ ought to be reckened among them. Ye and that
thereto it is verily an heten thing / if it be conferred with matrimony. And
again ward that matrimony is verily an hevenly sp^etuall / and godly estate
compared unto this which men ar wont to call spretualle.

But I speak precysely that matrimony is soche a thing of his own kind and
nature / for many persons do not vs^ it right and accordingly in faith / and
for because of vnbilefe they do turn that / which is good to be unto them
selves evil. Contrary wise it is not ^npossible that a man through the benefit
and goodness of faith may rightly / and well use an estate that is called
spretualle. And by their faith to change that which is evil to be unto them
good. But yet for this better or worse usage can not matrimony be called e^ille
/ nor the spretualle estate be called good / for faith makes all things good
ye eve^ verydeth and all miss happes^ But unbelief or ungodliness causes all
things to be evyll ye both the life and also god him self. Of the usage and
mysusage of estates do I now nothing speak / but of naturalle kind and
proparte that are in estates^ / concludinge and afferminge. That matrimony is
as gold. But the spretu^lle estates as dounge: by cause that the first
promoteth / and brings one to faith / and the other unto unbelief or
wickedness / furthermore matrimony does not only govern the heart / or
inward parts of man before god by faith / but also the body outwardly by
deeds. So that it requires both faith and also works / making p^ovisio^ both
for ye body and for ye soul orderi^ge the^ both well and virtuously /
matrimony (I say) is of soche an inclinacyo^ / that of the own nature i^
requires labor and sweat / and to be maintened by hand warke / and is there
unto properly led or inclined by the wo^de of God / written in the.iij.
chapte^ of Genesis / in this form. In the sweat^ of thy vysage shalt thou
eat thy bread. That they which in it ar coupled must needs put them selves in
perilles and dangers / and abide lokinge whether their labor come well to
pass or no. They must also many times take hurt and loss / suffering many
things in their wife children and householde or familye. But who is he that can
reckene up all the pains / labors and sweat of their face? So that truly as
the body in wedlock is occupied and exercised with labor / care / study /
pains / travayle and misery: In like wise must the heart be occupied and
exercysed with faith / knoweng always that these things be godly cominge of
God / and are to him ioyfulle and pleasante. But our spretualty (which they so
call) is more sle^thfulle / then Asses of Archadye and do not live by their
own labor / nor do any whitte exercise their body / sufferinge other mennys
labor to be turned in to their profit fedinge and pamperinge their gutte of
other mennys sweat and labor / not willinge to take any loss or disprofite
in their own goods. So that here does appear no sweat of their face. But it
fares by them / according as yt is written in the Psalm.lxxij. They be not
in the labor of men / and shall not be scurged or suffer pain with men. And
therefore ar they cloyed with pride / and overwhelmed with iniquite and
wickedness etc. And allthough they be often in their prayers and singing /
doing their spretuall works (so verily will they h^ve them called) yet do no
such works help^ or profit unto the exercise of the body. And all be it
these things all were done so well as is possible: yet were it uncertain
whethere they ^hulde be plesante unto God / or no. But contrary wise for
somoche as they have not the word of God to confi^me the^ / god can not be
pleased in them.

Thou will here obiecte against me: No parsone shall then by this sentence
abide single or chaste: but every man shall contracte matrimony which thing
should be contrary unto this text of Paul. I would that all men were / as I
my silfe am? To this I make answer / that I did now speak of the spretualle
estates compared unto matrimony / and not of syngle lyvinge or chastity. A
spretualle (as they call yt) estate is profitable unto no thing at all: but
very nawgh^ and most damnable. And yt were better that no body should be so
spretuall / but every man to be married. More over syngle and chaste lyvynge be
an other manner thing then a spretualle estate. Of spretuall estates does Paul
here speak no thing at all: But he speaks of true chastity / for no estate
(I report me unto you) is more unchaste ne more prone unto wantonness lecherye
/ or fornycacyon / then is this which we call ecclesiastike or spretualle /
as experience does now a days over much show. But if so be that some of them
do lyve chaste / yet not with standinge they do not use chastity accordi^ge
unto the ordinance and rule of Paul. So that it can not be that chastity /
whereof saint Paul does here make mencyon / for they of chastity do make
avaunsemente of merit / excellencye / and dignite or worthynesse before god
and man. But saint Paul makes it an easiness / and quietness / whereby one
may the morceasely / lightly and quietly / serve in the word of God / gevinge
more head or attendance unto ye same. So that finally in learning thereof he
may grow / and be mo^ested fast in faith.

I say unto the unmarried men and wyddowes / it is good for the^ if they do
abide / even as I do.
Of this may you well gather / that Paul was ones married and had a wife / for
in this passage when he says: I say unto the unmarried and widows / he
speaks only of widdowhode / differringe to treat of virgins until a little
here under / where as he entreats only and distinctly both of them / and of
their estate / life as here he does speak only of widdowers widows and of
their estate / among who^ he reckeneth him silfe.

But in the treatise of virginite he makes of him silfe no mencyon / ne
count^th him silfe among the^. How be it many do wene that ge did continue a
virgen / according as is written in the.ix. chapter of his first pisile unto
the Corinthia^s. Have not we (says Paul) power to lead about a sister to
wife as well as other apostles / and as the brethren of the lord and Cephas?
Other only I and Barnabas have not power this to do? But this does not prove
that Paul did always lyve single / but much more does it rather show that he
had a wife / yet for all that would not he lead her about with him as the
other apostles did lead about their wyfes. So that by this text only / he
showed plainly unto our understanding / yt he now was as an other widdower
with out a wife / and yet nevertheless he had power la^fully to take one.

Moreover it is rygh^ credible that he had a wife. For the Jews (among who^
Paul did lyve / and was brought up from his birth) did abhor and recounte no
thing worse the^ chastity or single lyving / with out a special priviled^e or
exemp^yon And yet as it is testified Philippens.ii. he did continue lyving
among them with out any fault / that man could countrolle him for or fynd^ in
him.

For this purpose does that also well serv^ which is written in the.iiii. to
the Philippyans / where he says / ^e and I beseech ye faythfulle yoocke
fell^we help the women / which labor with me in the gospelle. This yoocke
fellow has many understand to be Paul's wife / and that not with out just
causes. S^yng that he makes no mention of hy: name / And also no man ell^^ys
wont so to speak / calling a woman his naturalle and faithfulle married mate
or fellow / that in greek is called syzyge gnesie which is to say naturalle /
o^ very wife ye bears the same yoocke / and has made with him a special
covenaunte or co^tracte above other / like as they do yt ar knytte i^ matrimony
/ onles she were his lawful wiffe and spouse / and here unto her he commits
and betaketh the ^ure to help other women. According therefore unto this
^igure or manner of speakinge must we say. Other that Paul's wife was
decessed? Or else that by co^sente of them both he did leve and depart from
her for a season / less ^e should lead her about with him (as is showed.j.
Corin. ix) and that in matrimony he did so lyve chaste. But how so ever this
was / whether his wife was dedde / or else by her mind and will she left
him for a seasone for ye gospelles sake / yet is this undoubtedly true / yt he
did live like a wyddower / which a fore time had been married. But unto what
conclusion this matter shall now bring us / I beseech you let us diligently
see.

Some be so farforth brought / that they are enfo^ced ^o knowledge. That prystes
and bisshoppes may be sacred in matrimony / and they which are married may be
pristes and lefully use the office of them / Because ^y testimony of scripture
they see that for ye most part all the apostles and all the bysshopes which
were their successores were married But then they seek how they shall save^ and
defend themselves / saying: We read that before they were chose^ aparte and
segregate unto the office of Apostles / bisshoppes / and pristes / that they
were married But if any of the^ were their unto called before they were married.
Of the^ do we not read that afterward they did mary / And therefore is it not
lefulle for prystes now a days to mary Unto such disputers shall this place
gyve sufficient knowledge.

First. Seeing that vow do confess and grant that married ^olke be made
bishops and prystes / and that they so not only be but also may be: Because
the example of the apostles does so both teach and require. What manner men
then are you / that will now a days no married body admit unto the office of
a pryste? You do not only debar from prystehode the^ that will marie / and
there unto be disposed / but the^ also which allredy have wifes and be married.
Which thing notwithstanding does clearly repugne agaynest Christ and his
Apostles / And moreover against saint Paul: all be yt he hi^ sylfe had lyved
syngle and unmarried. For he says that he ought to be chosen for to be a
bishop / that is the husband of one wife / and that has his chyldre buxum
and obedient. I beseech you / tell me. whom shall we beleve to have more
wisdom and holiness / you? or else Christ? Christ did chose unto him
prystes and apostles that were married / and them does he afterward also
co^ferme by the teachinge of his apostles. But soche do you refuse and
disprove. Wherefore other Christ must be both a fool and vnryghtewes. Or you
your selves must be Antychristes and deceavers. Furthemore ^ welbeloved if so
you had left ^hys part unto us free. That accordy^ge unto the example of the
Apostles / married men might have been made prystes / and had not besydeforth
ordained or decreed / That it is not lefulle for prystes to marye. Men should
not so much have s^ryve^ in the matter ne so grette peril should thereof have
followed. For then should many yt be coupled in marriage have taken and received
prystehode / and a great sort should have first tried and known matrimony.
So that there should not have been so many whoreme^gers and lecherours. But
now you make this pretense and color: That you did never read / that prystes
did marye wyfes / and also do remove and put away universally all marriage from
p^^stes. Contrary unto god / unto nature / unto reason / and unto right / only
of presumption with out all manner of cause. So that you do fylle and
replenisshe all ^he world with whordome / and fo^nicacyon. Why th^rfore have
not you duly another read ne co^sydered this text before rehearsed / taken out
of the.ix. cha^yter of ye first pystle unto the Corynthyane? Is not in yt
plainly noted and showed. That a pryste may laufully be take him sylfe unto
matrimony? For be yt in case that Paul was then other a vyrge^ or else a
wyddower. Yet notwythstandyng he says that yt was la^f^ll and ^yght for him
to lead a b^ute a wife. But say unto me I beseech you / was not Paul then an
Apostle / a bishop / and a pryste? I am suer that you can not shewe^ ne say
the contrary. W^y the^ is he so bold to say that he has power / and
authoryte to marye. Y^ the^ the hygheste state / that is to wi^ of Apostles do
permit / and suffer a married man so stylle to abide / or else afterward (if
so he has no wife before) to mary and ta^e one. W^y do not also the lower
degree or estate of prystes permit / and allow the same?

Moreover seeing that saint Paul does li^^ a widdower / and yet will not be
forfe^ded from power to marye a wife / ne have yt taken a way from him / he is
verily after the popes law digamus. All be it he recketh not therefore: And to
be digamus by the Popes law is a thing so hydeous and detestable / that all
though a man so being were with out a wife / yet should he not be admitted for
to be a pryste. Finally digamus betokens hi^ / that has had two wifes. Such
in the old testamente were those called / that had two wyfes at ones / or to
gether. But the canon law / which is made by the pope / and his clyentes has
translate this word in to an other significacyon. And has made three manner of
digamus. The first is if a man by process of time be twice married / all be yt
other each of the women / whom he did mary were maidens or vergyns. Secondly if
a man does mary but ones / if so she whom he married were a widdowe. Thyrdely
if a man do mary one / that has been defloured in stedde of a maid.

And these be all of the pope called digami / Another may any man after the death
of such wifes be promoted (as they are wont to call y^) unto the ordres of
prystehode. But if one had corrupt / and defiled an hundredth other men^ys
wifes / and had depryved an hundredth maids of their verginite / and beside
that should also keep with him or mayntene an hundredth harlottes or concubines
/ he moughte yet in the best wise both be made / and there to well abide or
continue a priste. Soche an holy thing is their pristehode. There is no sin
/ ne no myschefe in all the world so great ne so diverse and manifold that
can let a man from pristhode / except only divine and godly matrimony. Which
not withstanding they both do call and confess to be a sacrame^te / and
work / or creature of god. And thus may not that only / which is the work
or creature of god stand with their pristehode.

Therefore show me now / if so thou ca^sie / how soche abominable presumpcyon
of making soche wicked tradicyo^s and laws can agree with the doctrine or
learning of Paule^ Which is a widdower / and yet by lawfulle authoryte and
power will mary a wife. And not only being so content / he geveth thereto
power by this text (which we do now i^treate of) unto all both widdowers and
widows / to do the same no man except another priste / ne lay man. what
other answer may we here make / then that soche folk by these ungracious
constitucyons (which so apertly and shame fully do rage against ye word of
god) would make us in understanding like a stock or a block? And make us
beleve that whordome / ad^outry / and fornicacion were better then wedlock or
matrimony? O gracyous lord onles thy mercy were so great / as scripture
thereof does make report / that is to say / infinite / and unmeasurable / how
couldeste thou that art so mighty rightwys / and pure of judgment abide or
suffer this / and such other like wicked presumpsyon and boldenes / soche
stinking whoredom / and uncleanness? What other thing is here sought / the^
that the creature / ordinance / and work of god should be discommended and
reproved. And yt unto whordome should be made an open ca^pe / free passage /
and space to over run all the world? Like as now a days (a lack for pity)
we do see with our yes And as Daniel did prophecy of the kingdom of
Antichriste Yt shall not be touched with regard or care of women / as who
should say: the regard of whores shall only in it bear rometh.

For asmoche therefore as they be compelled to knowledge that the apostles even
after their apostlesshippe did abide still and continue in matrimony I would
feign know why that prystes do not mary? Or else wherefore they may not mary?
Is marriage such a devillysshe thing / if so yt be begone after pristehode /
and so godly if it go b^ore the same? Must it suffer such alteracyon for
going before / and cominge after? Verily all reason must knowledge / and every
man (as is said commonly) must needs feel at his fyngers ends / yt what so
ever thing may be godly with pryste hode and after it / ye very same may be
well begu^ne in pristehode / and before it. Moreover this may right well be
called a shameful iuggkynge and a sore deceavable color / that matrimony
should be called and preached to be a godly thing (as in very deed it is) and
granted of them to be an holy sacrament / and yet may not be admitted that a
godly thing and sacrament should have place with our prystes O miserable and
blind blyndenes / that men not only can not be made beleve that such things
be very tryfles / and delusyons but also yt they be brought in mind to judge
that manner of lyvynge to be of all other most excellent and best / how
myghtever this thing have come to pass / onles ye wrath of god had thus
punisshed the world / and plaged it with blindness?

Let us therefore abide here by Paul / which in no wise shall deceave us. He
does ordeyne that widdowers may lefully marye wifes whether they be prystes /
or no: beside forth that all manner widdowers or unmarried men may mary wifes.
So that it should another hurt ne hinder unto pristehode if one married a
widdowe. Nor any whit help and further / if he marye a maid / and vyrgen. For
there ought to be no such respect of parsons concerning this purpose. But
all soche things among christian me^ ought to be free / and in their electyon
to take whether they lust / other maid / or widdowe to be their laufu^le
wifes / with out any damage or prejudice in any thing / and this thing (that
is to wit yt pristes have authorite to mary wifes / like as have all other
me^ and yt with out any respect of parsones / whether they be mayde^s or else
widows) does saint Paul sufficiently confirm / and approve in this / y^ he
writes this pistle not unto layemen only (as they are wont to call the^) but
unto yt bisshopes also / and prestes and generally unto the all christian me^ of
Corinthe. And because he does separate none estate / ne parsone: yt shall not
be lefulle for us to apply and appointe his word unto lay me^ only / nor yet
unto any other certain estate or parsone.

Saint Paul truly did know fulle well both by the doctrine / and also by ye
ordinance of Christ / yt another ye work of god might be let / or
forbidden / ne his creature fordone and destroyed. Now is man verily the
creature / and work of god / made or create to begette children / and to
multiplye his seade / as appears Gene. i. For asmoche therefore as god which is
always co^stante / like minded / and with out any altera^yo^ made man at the
beginni^ge in this wise / and so would him continually for to be. Think you
surely yt it pleases hi^ not now another for love of pristehode / no nor for
love of his eua^gely (which is of all other things most precious) to make of
a man a stock or a stone. Another to let the work or operacyo^ of man's
nature which of god ar naturally in the^ implanted. But what other thing is
it to say / when a priste is forbidden to mary / then that a man should not be
a man And yt the creature or work of god should ^esse / because of humayne
presumpcyon and laws. Only God which did thus create man / may these things
in him altere and change through his gifts and grace. But free will with all
his powers and enforseme^tes be here very nothing ne can any thing do.
Therefore says Paul.

I say unto the unmarried me^ / and widows: It is good for the^ if they abide
even as I do: But and if they can not abstain / let them mary. For it is
better to marye / then to burn.
It is good verily to abide as Paul did / but in continente he adds wherefore
it is not good and yt it is better to co^tracte matrimony / then to abide in
widdowhode or unmarried. And Paul does here show forth all at ones all the
causes of matrimony / and se^teth abound to mesure or enclose all the glory of
castite / when he says: But and if they can not abstain / let them marye.
This is as much to say. Necessite compels the to mary again. How
excellently so ever therefore chastyte be praised / and how noble so ever the
gift thereof be / yet necessite causes that very few do there unto attain /
for they can not abstain and abide chaste / for all be it yt we are christen /
havinge the sprete of god by faith: yet is not the work and creature of god in
us stroyed and taken away from us / that thou must cesse to be a woman / and
I a man. Another does the sorete bereve from the body his inclinacyon and
naturalle works / but that it may eat / drink / sleep / disgeste / and
disgeftyon avoyde / like as the body of an other man.

In like wise does not the sprete take away from man ne from woman their
shappes / their lymmes / or members / their seade / ne their fruit and
operacyon / for a christen man's body must aswelle norisshe seade / begette
children / and multiplye / as the body of other men of birds and of all bestes
/ and lyvely things. Unto the which purpose it also was create. As is showed
Genesis.i. So that man of necessite must appete naturally a woman / and the
woman a man / onles god wonderfully by a singular and excellent gift do hold
them therfro and delyver them. And thus means Paul here in this place / when
he says: But if he ca^ not abstain / let him mary. As though he should say.
Unto whom god has not geven a singular grace / but leaves in his body the
nature and disposicion of the same: It is good for him / ye it is necessary
that he do mary / forsakinge both verginite and also wyddowhede / furthermore
it is not the mind of god to make a principalle and singular gift common unto
many / but would that marriage should be common to each body: like as he did ones
ordene and create yt / he will not take away his creature from every man / ne
let the operacyon of the same.

Moreover a Christen man is sprete and flesh. By reason of the sprete he
neadeth not of matrimony. But because his flesh has communion and felishippe
with the corrupt flesh in Adam and Eve / and so is fulle of lust and
concupiscence / for this disease and malady has he truly neade of matrimony:
and by his own strenght / or power can he not be with out them / for his
flesh rages / burns / and breadeth seade / as well as does the flesh of
any other parsone. Where as by matrimony / as by a medicine there unto much
necessary and behovable he does not ease / help / quench / and repress yt /
for in the.iij. chapter of Genesi. he shows clearly before our face / what
thing he would suffer in man / when he did not only not take away the
blessinge of multiplicacion /but rather did allow and conferme yt. When
notwithsta^dinge he did know full well / that such blessing could not be
fulfilled and performed of nature (that was corrupt and fulle of
concupiscence) whith out sin.

But that matrimony is comenly had in disdain as a thing that is cause of
many myseries / pains / troble / and hevynes / and so yo^ge people are thereby
persuaded to decline there fro unto vnwylfull chastity: yt is a reason
unprofitable and of no value / but pevisshe and much synfulle. Another have
they so made good the cause of their chastity. For necessite does always
preve^te and stop out this forechaste or provisio^. Which says that yt
another is / ne yet ca^ so be. For no man ca^ ground or set him self fast in
heven: According as here does affirm saint Paul: he that can not abstain
(says he) / let him mary. Again ward that matrimony is hyghly commended as
a thing that is hevynly and godly and most fulle of all goodness. This is like
wysse a reasone of small effect / and prevayleth not. Forthere is no man o^
else very few that would be moved with these good things that come of yt /
to geve their selves there unto. Nature always abhors labor and sweat /
inseparable co^panio^s of honest marriage.

There be also very many other causes of m^ryage. Some do mary for love of money
and worldly goods. A great sort does fall there to for curiosyte to
satisfye their appetite and pleasure that they have to attempt all things.
Some do be take the^ there unto for to get the^ h^yres. Saint Paul shows
only on cause / and that is necessite. It is therefore called necessite / for
nature must needs have an issue / and go forth / that it may increase and be
multiplied. But this will not god admit with out matrimony Therefore has
every man neade to go there unto / necessite so requiringe and constreynige him
to do / if so he will here before God pass his lyve with a good conscience.
And were it not that this necessyte did thus bind / wreste / and dryve me / I
wot not truly what matrimony the other causes should make and stablisshe.
Namely curiosite / which at y^ first moves these foles with lightenese to
begine soche an erneste sobre godly and necessary estate / wherein does sone
come unto them the thing / which they sought.

But what means he by this yt he says it is better to mary the^ to burn?
Every man no fail that with out marriage and a specialle grace at te^pteth to
lyve single or chaste knows right well what this saying is and what it does
mean. Another does he here touch any secret or prevy things: but he speaks
of yt common and manifest experience and feli^ge yt al me^ has / which with
out matrimony or ^ singular grace do labor to lyve chaste or unmarried / for he
does attribute burninge unto all parsones / that with out the high and singular
gift of chastity do lyve unmarried and chaste. Another does he teach any remedy
therefore except only the copulacyon of matrimony. All beyt they use to call
soche burninge prevy troble and affliction. Which proverb should not have
been so vulgar or comone / if so it had been a uery secret or prevy evil.
Another is it any doubt but these also unto whom is geven the gift of chastity
/ do some time feale lust or prickinge / and be there with tempted: but by
cause yt passes / and shortly perisfheth / therefore is not soche a thing in
them called a burninge / Generally burninge is a fervore heat / tikillinge /
preckinge / and yt chenge of the flesh / which restith not / ne blinne^h of
boilinge or raginge / and is a daily inclinacion or dispocision other to a
woman or to a man which is in every body / where is not desire and love unto
chastity. So that there be found so very few that lacks this boilinge and
burninge in the flesh / as there be few that has this sovereign gift of
chastity geven them of god. But with this burninge ar some pained hardly / some
more softely or easily / Some be so sore tormented / that they are feign to
pour out and shede their nature / Which all do belong un to matrimony. In so
much that I dare be bold to say / Where as is now one chaste / there ought
more then an hundred thousand to live married.

Thou canste here in have no better councelle geven the / then that thou
shuldeste follow and lay before the / the example of saint Hierome / which
extollinge chastity with most high / but most perilous lauds and
comendacion: Neverthelesshe he confessheth that he could not tame his flessh
another by any fasting / ne yet prayers. So that chastity was un to him more
than any man can say hard and painfulle. O how much blessed time did he lose
in flesshely thougtes He was of that opinion that he thought chastity might be
gotten by our power and strength / and indged yt to be comone un to all me^.
Behold this holy man being thus infired wi^h heat and burni^^e of ye flesh
/ ought to have married a wife. Here now seist thou what a thing it is to
burn. He was in ye nombre of them that belonged unto matrimony / and he did
injury unto him silfe / which attempted many things / that he should not be
married. Many of these examples shall thou find in a ^oke called de Vitis Patrum.

Therefore this is the conclusion of saint Paul. Where as is not this
surmountinge / principalle / rare / and singular gift of god / there of
necessite must be other burninge / or else matrimony: Now is it much better
to be joined in maryag^ / then to burn. Because that burninge a^ though non
evil deed should thereof ensue / yet not with standinge it is frustrate and
vain chastity / for so much as it is not kept with delight and love / but
with great yrkesomnes / werynesse / grudginly / by enforseme^t / and
unwillingly. So that before god it is esteemed eve^ as incontinencye and
vnchastite Where ye heart is unclean / when the body by violence so ca^ not
be. What avails it therefore thought thou keptiste by great painfulle and
vnpleasante labor vain and unclean cle^nes? Yt were much better for the /
if thou were clearly married / and so to be void or with out this joy or
pleasure as they take it for to be and wene that it is / but all amiss / for
all be / it that in matrimony also is both a^fliction / pain / troble and
angwisshe / yet not withsta^dinge may a man geve him unto all these / and
sometime have pleasure and quietenesse But where as lacks a sovereign grace
with out matrimony / yt can not be that thou maiste geve thy mind unto
chastity / and lyve therein merely or in quietenesse.

Consider also now I beseech the / how mad teachers and rulers they be /
which ^o^pelle youth every where in all cloyster^ unto chastity / teachinge ye
chastity the more hard and painfulle it is for them / and the more that it
stands again there mind / ye more excellent and better it is for them.

All be it yt with other things thou maiste thus play and daly / here
notwithstanding thou must do otherwise with chastity / for it can not be
wylfulle / where as is not ready p^esente a singular grace. Any other thing
may be wilfulle through faith. These manner of men do after the fassyon of the
Jews / which offeringe there children unto Moloch did burn them in the fire.
So that me seameth that Paul for this cause did use this word burning / that
he would touch and signifye this abhominacyon. For what is it else to close
and shute up a young parsone all his lyve long with such a burninge other in
cloys^res / or yet else where / then to offer^ or consecrate them unto the
devylle for honor / that he shall be constrained so to keep miserable and
damnable cha^tite?

I am here compelled for cause of such teachers and rulers to show you of a
thing / which I heard ones told of an honest and a sad man / to
thentente that such rude and blind hedes / if so they will / may feale eve^
with their hand how ^nwisyly they govern and rule One of their faculte which
was a preacher did at a time declare and tell in an open audience / that a man
which would please god / must begin to chastise himsilfe suerl^^ And for an
example he brought forth out of the book called de Vitis patrum one Simeon
which did stand an whole year upon an high pillar on his one foot continually
praying with out interrupcion / vntille that worms did bread in his foot /
which all when they fell down were changed in to precious stones Likewise
(said he) must thou also punisshe and chastise thy silfe / if so thou lust
to serve god. Soche manner of folisshe trifles and toies becomes well soche a
folisshe preacher. Which with out doubt Satan did then ymagine for to moke and
begile Christen people / To thentente that he might for do and destroy the
miracles of holy men / which in yt time were wrought. As though they all did
saver of soche pevisshe mochage and triflinge.

Beside forth this mocker or trifeler took also for his purpose a young child
that went to grammar scole (for so is yt commonly seen that as men are wont to
say / one fool makes ten other) which after a singular wise studing to
serve god kept in his urine that he might so pain and punisshe him silf. In
the fourte day by cause he had made no water / he began to fall sick / And
when he could of no body be persuaded to piss and make water / he minded so
to die / un tille god by inspiracion did put in the mind of a c^rten person /
that he should praise him in his entente or interprise and comfort him as one
that had done well and ver^uo^sly. (For as says Solomon so must men speak
with fools in their matter^) How beit quod he men say that thou do yt for
a vain glory / But if ye do so / then y^ yt nothing worth. When he had ones
heard this / he forsook and gave over his purpose saying / Seeing they do thus
say and interpret the matter in this wise / I will rather do any thing /
the^ perform that / which I have begun. This is truly a rud^ and gross
folly / But yet ought we not to set light their by / or utterly despise yt. For
in yt has god showed as I said before what learning soche preachers and
rulers do teach. Therefore will I entreat of yt in this place somewhat the
more largely. Yt fares verily thus (like as the script^re and all experience
do show) that this life / which man leads here in the earth is miserable /
wretched / and wofulle. What so ever ^state thou shall ^hoese / or take the
unto / ye though yt seame never so bl^ssyd and godly. And yet is there none so
wretched or wofulle^ but if a man by precepte should be compelled to keep in
his urine or his disgestio^ / he would doutelesse rather ^hoese to do any other
thing / then to take upon him to do any soche impossibilite. But because no
body y^ compelled unto this I mean to keep in his urine or disgestio^. No man
verily does consider and esteem how profitable and precious a thing yt is to
avoyde them from him. And yet in the mean season they mark and bewail the
misery of their estates / which not with standinge is ten times less / then
the wo^ and misery before said / if so they should be compared to gether.

In like condition stands yt with this burninge. For they that are knitte in
marriage be at liberty. They may quench that which burns them / another
take they thought or care for that pain and misery (like as a woman which
after that she is delivered / thinks much other wise then when she was in
traveling). Another do they afterward note or regard any thing savinge the
troble and sorynesse of their condition. For like as a good thing when yt is
present is not regarded / eve^ so an evylle wh^^ yt is paste is no more
remembrede. But they which yet do abide in soche heat or burninge / and do
never hope from yt to be rid and delevered / what other thing else can they
do / then skorne and count for fools them / that are wedded? And yet
nevertheless they groone and complain of this which does so vex them. They
are thus compelled to keep that / which ought not to be kept / and that also
in vain / and to lose all their hard and paynfulle labors. Which thing of
all other is most miserable and soroufulle. How much sooner should they suffer
and bear all the burdones and vexacio^s of marriage / the^ soche burninge? And
to tell you shortly. Sorry marriage is better then sorry chastity. And an hard
or paynfulle marriage is better then hard or paynfulle chastity. The reason
hereof is not far to be sought / for soche chastity perissheth and i^ of non
effect: but soche marriage does profit help and is much frutefulle^ And this
do I speak of ye burni^ge of the^ / yt continue chaste / of which be very
few. The great multitude do not suffer this heat / ne continue chaste / but
labor by all means to be delivered from it. Of which thing I will now no
thing write. But so sone as they yt lyve unmarried be here of rid / does
their conscience torme^te and co^de^ne the^ / which among all other pains
is most intollerabl^ / and wretchidfull^ And thus does ye matter in conclusion
come to pass: yt they which without a singular grace / do lyve single and
unmarried / for ye more part be so pained and trobled yt eve^ with their body
they fall unto ribaudry and sin of lechery. But the other few do lyve
outwardly chaste / and inward berybaudes or lechers. So that ye first are
indaunger of damnacyon / and the other must needs live a sorry miserable and
unprofitable life

And where be now both seculare and also ecclesiasticalle rulers and o^ficers
/ that should consider in their hearts and look apo^ these torments of wofulle
and wretched souls? But they them selves by there daily co^pulsion and
requests do promote and help forth the liynge spr^te of error to multiplye
daily these evilles.

The second part. Unto the married command no^ I / but the lord. That the
wife separate not her silfe fro the man If she separate her silfe / let her
remain unmarried / or be reconciled unto her husband again. And let not the
husband put a way his wife.
Hitherto has he spoken of widdowers and widows. In whom of both parties the
one may l^fully be with out the other / ye man with out a woman / and contrary
wise / ye it is profitable that they so be / if they ca^ ly^e severalle a lone.
But this can not be permitted in married folks / for the word of god byndeth
them to lyve in company to gether. But that they that are unmarried and widows
should continue unwedded / it is another commanded of God / ne forbidden: but
is a pure and wholesome councelle of the apostle. And it is granted them frelye
before god other to mary again / or else to abide in widdowhode.

The aposile permits divorsemente unto the man / and unto the wife / but
upon this condicyon / that they both afterward do abide sole and unmarried. In
which thi^^e he does both disanulle y^ law of Moses / by the which a man
might put a way his wife / when he was weary of her / or did hate her / and
mary an other.

And when she was separate might mary with an other / in the.xxiii^. chapyter
of Deuteronomy. Wherefore allthough Moses gave soche a law unto the Jews which
were stubb^rne / froward / styffe minded / and of h^the^ co^dicio^s / yet is
yt not lefulle so for ch^iste^ people to do And therefore does Christ also him
silfe dis^nulle the same law in the.xix. chapter of Matthew. For in the old
testamente were laws that did not only c^^cerne the sprete / but y^ also
regarded worldly policye and civil o^deringe of the como^s In somoche as god
did govern and gyde that same people both spretually and also bodyly. In like
manner as many things be ordened in the Emper^res law / which not with
standinge be not lefulle / for a christen man to use / soche as these are to
withstand or put away violence violently / to sue or keep plee / and other
like.

Laws whereby male factores are chastened and let from there purpose be much
differente from those by which the good people be instruct and ruled. In like
manner was this law institute to punysshe e^yll doer^ / and to stop their
pur^oses / less they happily should kylle their wifes / (...) do that were else
worse. But Christen people must be heartily good (so that soche law is not
necessary for them) and keep stylle their wifes / so long as they shall lyve.
But where right Christen folk are not / there at this hour is yet this law
needful to be used / that should pardone and permit unto them ^or to depart
fram their wyfes / after the gyse of paynemes / and to mary other / less by
dissencyon in levinge to gether / they should twyse purchase selle / that is to
wit both in this life present / and in the other following. But yet ought soche
parsones maki^g so divorse know / yt they in so lyvynge wea^e no l^nger
christian people / but paynemys in a damnable estate.

The Apostle does speak here of one cause of dyvorsemente / that is to wit
anger. When the husband and wife can not company to gether and lyve in
agreme^te or unite / but are let and / pulled away both from prayer and all
other good dede^ through means of hate and anger. This does the text
manifestly show / when he says / Let them be reco^cyled / and let the^
abide to gether vnseparate. But if they will not be reconcyled / but will be
separate / let them abide unmarried. Where now reconcylynge is commaundded /
there dow^elesse is anger and debate showed to be. But soche dyvorsement truly
does the Apostle dissemblinge or twinkelinge / at men's infirmite permit /
when.ij. parsones can not to gether agree with in them selves. Else truly one
had neade to have borne an others burden / and not to depart a sondre in any
wise. And this certes is the cause why he denies unto them that are ^yvorsed
and separate / after that to mary with any other parsone / to thentente that
they should so have occasyon to be reconcyled again the one unto the other and
come again to gether. Ye in yt he binds and co^pelleth the^ to love ^ new
each other and keep company agayne^ For asmoche as parhappes the gift of
chastity is not gyven them.

But what if the one will not love again / or have ^tonement with the other /
and will algate be separate / and the other ^artye not havynge power to
abstain or abide chaste should ^e enforced to chose him ^ wife for his mate /
what shall thy^ parsone do / may not ^e lefully mary with an other wife? To
that I make answer thu^ s^^yng yes doutlesse may he / for seeing that he is
not commanded to abide chaste / another has the gift of chasti^e gyven him /
and beside fo^the his mate unto whom he was before married will no^ voytsave to
be a^one with him / and love him again / but takes away from him her body /
which he can not be with out. These things thus laid to gether and well
esteemed / you shall know that god will not bind him to that thing / which
excedeth his ^ower / for the presump^yon o^ le^denesse of the other party. And
he m^ste do in like wise as his married fellow were decessed. Specially s^ynge
that he did not ^^fuse to be reconciled and brought to atonemente. Again the
which whether so ever ^ar^ye do withstand / the same ought to abide vnwedde /
all be it the other do after mary again. As here does afferme Paul saiy^^.

To the remnaunte speak I and not the lord. If any brother have a wife that
beleveth not. If she be co^tente to dwell with him / let him not put her a
way. And the woman which has unto her husband and infidele / if he consent
to dwell with her let her not put hem a way.
When saint paul records that this part is not his saying / but y^ saying
of y^ lord / he shows yt it is not commanded of god to do other this or
else that / for he divides his saying from the word or saying of God. So
that the saying of god is a precepte and co^mavndemente / but his / is a
counsel. More over his entente is to say thus. To the remnaunte / that is to
wit / where reigns no debate and brawlinge betwyxte married mates. As when two
ar coupled in matrimony. Of which the one is a christian / and the other
havinge no knowledge of christ (like as it was commonly seen when faith was at
the first time preached among the gentilles that one should turn him unto
Christ / and an other turn from him) All be it that in this case a Christen
parsone may depart from one that is not Christen. Yet nevertheless the
councelle of the apostle is that soche should not depart. Inasmoche as his
married mate which is not Christen does accept him and is content with him
And does not let him to cou^terfette and express Christ in manner of lyvinge /
another co^strayneth him to lyve wyckedly or to abjure Christ.

This does Paul signifye in this word if she consent or be content to
dwell with him etc. That is to say if an infidele or vnbelever be content /
and will dwell with him that ha^h married her / and will suffer her to do all
that pertayneth unto a christen body / for matrimony is but a corporalle and an
outward thing which does another hurt ne help / another does hinder ne
further faith: And in which the one may be a christian / and the other an
infidele. As well as one that is sworn unto Christ may eat / dri^ke / bye /
selle / and occupye with a payneme / a Jew or a Turk in all manner exterior
things. Like as ^vyn now a days one may be a ^erfecte and devoute Christian
and the other a wicked and famed or false Christyan. So that matrimony for
cause of byleve or un byleve ought not to be broken and fordone.

But if an infidele would not suffer his married mate to abide Christian / or to
lyve a Christian life / but would persecute and let her. There were it
conveniente time y^ a christen body should use the sentence of Christ / which
says in the.x chapter of Matthew: He that loves his wife or children more the^
me / is not worthy of me. Here begins di^orseme^te. If so divorsemente be /
other must reconcylynge / and attonemente be made / or else the parsone which
refuses reconcilinge must abide unmarried and sole. So y^ yet unto the parsone
which disyreth to have peace and atonemente shall not be denied authorite
afterward to mary an other / as is specifyed before / for Christ which is
the spouse of the soul must be greater / and bear more rome then the
corporalle spouse. If therefore the one will not suffer y^ other to abide and
lyv^ to gether with y^ eter^alle spouse of the soul / Here may a Christen
parsone forsake her first corporalle spouse / and take an other which will
suffer Christ the eternalle spouse abide to gether with him.

So is it likewise co^venie^t and necessary to be used now in these days. If
y^ husband will teach and enforse his wife to do theft / ad^outry / or any
other vngracyousnes against god. In these is y^ same cause and reasone of
divorseme^te / that is spoken of before. So y^ except they be reconciled and
come to an ^^onemente / she may lefully mary an other husband. And in like
case might also the man do / if so his wife did instance him to ^vill / and
would not else ^e content to use him quietly for her husband. Of this
ground and principle comes / that advoutry makes divorse / and geveth power
unto y^ other parsone that lyveth truly according to the ordinance of
wedlock to be married a new to an other / for it was commanded in y^ law /
Deuterono.xiij. That every man should accuse his wife / brother / and most
assured frynde (that moved him to sin against God) before the judge / that
they might be slain. But in the new testamente (where corporalledeth and
slaughter bears no rome) it is sufficient to forsake them and depart away
from them. Of this is gathered. That those be wicked examples. In which we do
find that certain married women by consent of their husbands (which had been
imp^isoned) were defloured and viciate / to thentente that they I mean the
husbands tho^ow soche a vile deed should be delyvered. The precepte and word
of god ought to have been observed and kept / all though the husband or wife
/ body and goods / should have perisshed. Another has any man authoryte to
geve his wife leave to co^my^te advoutry.

The Apostle proceeds forth. For the vnbelevinge husband is sanctified by
the wife: And the vnbelevinge wife is sanctified by the husband. Or else were
your chyldre unclean: but now ar they pure.
This is spoken after the propertye of the hebrew speech / and according after
Paul's manner of speakinge. That unto the pure are all things pure / as he
says Titi. i. And Roma. viij. All thing works for ye best to to christen
people and to the^ that love God So that this is his sentence. A christian
married shall have no need to make divorseme^te. For there is no thing to let
the^ / but that they may abide with infideles / that are associate to them in
marriage / and also begette and bring up vnbelevinge child^e. The reason why is
/ where his married fellow does not compelle him to forsake and renounce
christian lyvinge / faith is so mighty a thing that no hurt can be to it / ne
to the possessioners thereof by lyvinge or company keeping with infideles and
vnbelevers. And it is all one unto them whether the thing be holy or unholy /
pure or else vnpure / yt they do use / for even very death which is of all
things most hydeous and terrible is unto them through faith an holy and a
precyons thing faith does use all things well and accordingly / whether they
be good or else evil / except only vnbileve and the fruits there of / for
they as strayte as a line be contrary unto faith / and thruste it out of place.
Else what so ever does not expelle faith and put it out of place / is by
reason of the same faith harmless / pure / clean / holy / profitable and
wholesome: So that faith may company with them / use them / and finally continue
with them with out any hurt or ieoperde / that may unto it through them
befalle for onles it were thus: No parsone might ever lyve christian / for he
must needs abide and pass the course of his life in ye mids of vnbelevi^ge
evil and wicked people, But when he follows not their manners / but does
ryghtly use the^ / he may well lyve by them / and among the^ / that by his
good behavore and diligence they finally may be stricken with remorse and
compunccio^ of mind and become godly and christian

In this is all the world unto a true christian nothing but holiness /
pureness / profit / and goodness. Contrary wise / All the whole world is
unto an vnbelever or an in fydele vnholynesse / uncleanness / hurt and
destruction / ye eve^ god hi^ silfe with all his vniuersalle goodness. As
Davyd writes in ye xvij. psalm sayng: Thou shalt with holy be holy / and
thou with the good and innocente shalt be innoce^te and good. And with the
chosen shalt thou be chosen / and with the perverse and weywarde shalt thou
be weywarde. And whyr for holy folks and saints / that is to say belevinge
persons do holyly and blessydly use all things. But the unholy and
vnbelevinge or infideles do dismerite or deserve the contrary / that is to say
they misuse / make unclean / and defyle them selves in all things universally
/ and that always. For they can use no thing well or holyly / that yt shall
profit them unto bliss. Thus be also infa^tes holy and clean / allthough they
have not yet received baptism Not because they be in their own person clean
and holy. Of which holiness or cle^nesse is here of Paul made no mention:
But because they be clean and holy to the. For thy holyne^se and cle^nesse may
lyve to gether with the and bring them up / with out defylinge the^ as though
both soche children and you tha^ are their parents were / holy or clean. For in
this wise entendeth here Paul to say / if a christen body should happly have
children with an infidele / which chyldre were grown unto years of discrecion
(as in that time was often seen) and they would not assente to be yet baptized
ne become the servantes of Christ. Then for so much as no person ought to be
constrained unto faith / but there unto to be drawn of god through preachinge
of the eva^gely. Another of ye fryndes should therefore purpose in their mind to
forsake their children / ne deny and take from the^ fattherly or motherly love
and kyndenesse / which they also do owe unto them / as though they did sin
and defyle the^ sylves by abydinge with their vnbelevinge children. But bodyly
they owe to be present with them / overseyng / rulyng / and nurtringe them as
well as they were most holy christianes / for they are not unclean (says
Paul) but holy and pure. That is to say / Thy faith may so be well occupied
and exercised about the^ / that yt shall yet abide both holy and pur^. Like
wise should me^ also do now a days / and at all times If their children would
not receave ye eua^gely / they ought not therefore to be refused and cast away
/ but thou should take dilige^te keep and make provision for them / as well as
if they were most faythfulle or Christian. Their faith commended unto god / so
long as in other points they were buxum / and behaved the^ honestly in
worldly and outwar / de things. For the outward deeds like as the pare^tes
may eve^ so are they also bound to let and inh^bite with punisshine^tes: But
vnbeleve and inward evilles. Another can any parsone let / ne by chastysemente
refrain except god onley. So that this text of saint Paul remains stylle
a mighty and valyant defense for us / teachinge that all things be holy and
pure to the^ that beleve / and have faith.

But and if the vnbelevinge depart / let him depart. A brother or a sister is
not in subjection to soche. God has called us in peace.
In this place Paul delyvereth and sets quyte a christian married parsone
gevinge sentence for him / that when his married mate being an infidele or an
vnbelevi^ge body will depart or else will not grant ye he shall follow
Christ. Then does he geve him liberty to mary again with an other. And that
Paul does here speak of married mate / being an infidele or payneme / the same
ought to be understand also of feigned or false christian. That if one married
mate would e^force the other to wickedness and misbel^ve / ne suffer him in
lyvinge to follow christ: The^ the parsone thus eville enforced should stand
lose / and at liberty to mary with whom he liked. Which thing onles
christ's law did allow to belefulle. A christian should be feign to follow
his married co^panyon being an infidele or misbelever: Or else against his
mind to abide chaste unto great perille of his soul / his nature there
against repininge / and all the powers of the same.

But this does Paul here deny saying. That unto soche is not a brother or a
sister in subjection / ne thraulde. as though he should say: Unto other
parsones o^ in othere causes / where as man and wife do abide to gether with
rendringe one an other due benevolence of matrimony and soche other things
like is the one bound unto the other / and another has power of them selves.
But where as the one will strain the other unto wicked and ungodly lyvinge /
or else they will depart a sondre / In soche points is not a christen body
bound ne compelled to abide with soche mates any longer. If then he stands
not bound / then is he rid and dispatched. And if he be rid and dispatched
he may the^ lefully mary with an other. As though the parsone which is
coupled unto him in marriage were decessed.

But what if the second marriage did not by chance him well / so that the one
would compelle the other / the husband his wife or contrary wise / to lyve
ungodly / and after the fassyon of paynemis / until that he should come
unto.iij. or.iiij. maryages / should yt be lefulle then for a man so often to
marye a new wife as his old were soche one as I have spoke of before? so yt he
had stylle lyvinge ten wives or else more that had left and forsaken him? And
again ward shall yt be lefulle for a woman so to have ten or else more
husbands livinge / which are departed and gone from her? I make answer / We
may not stop saint Paul's mouth / ne stryve against the^ y^ lust to use
(so often as need requires) his teachinge. His words are manifest: That a
brother or a sister is free from the ^onde or law of marriage / if the other
party which with them is married will needs depart / or consent no longer
to tarry with the^ And he does not say that this thing may be ones done: but
he puts vnto^ our liberty ye thing / other to depart or else to abide
so often as soche a thing befalls. For he will have no person put in
ieoperde of incontinencie or fornicacion / that he should be therein intretayned
and intrapped through an other bodies / presumpcyo^ and lew^enesse? What is
that? Ought not a Christian body to tarry for other ye cominge again of his
married fellow / or else her discesse / lyke^ as unto this day has been
observed in comone usage / and also commanded by ye Popes laws? I answer ^
unto that / if soche one please to tarry / yt rests in his good will: for
seeing yt ye apostle does here set him quite and at liberte / he has no need
to abide for his first mate any longer: but he may change his estate and
take an other / if so he like / and yt by ye authorite and power of god And
would to god yt ye cominalte of christian people had used this teachinge of
Paul / or else yt they would yet cause yt to be brought in usage / when so
ever yt chaunseth yt ye man or ye wife runs away / and does for^ake the one
an other: whereof does afterward arise excedi^ge much fornicacio^ and sin
This thing has ye wrecchedde laws of the pope much helped forth / and
promoted / which bi^deth one married person utterly to abide other y^ cominge
again / or else ye decesse of ye other yt was his mate / and now departed and
gone from him And yt under ye pain (o p^esu^^cion / o shameless boldenes) of
everlastinge da^nacion / which (if yt after he do mary) he shall ru^ne in to.
And thus by means of these ungracious laws has y^ pope kept thraulde and
put in subjection chryste^ brethren and systers for ye presumpcion and
trespass of other / yt were / their married co^panio^s / and with out all manner
of causes has cast the^ in to of fornicacyon.

But what if the party that went away alleges that afterward he will
amend his life / shall they then be received and taken in to company again?
I say unto that if so the party which did abide and did / not begin first
to depart does continue in the estate^ that he was in before / and has not in
the mean seasone married with an other / he may then receave his first mate /
which he was joined unto before / but did depart from him / and not only he
may thus do / but also he ought to be cou^celled so for to do / that they may
love each other again and company to gether / like as they did at the first.
But if in the mean space he shall parhappes be married unto an other / then ye
party which did forsake her married companion must utterly with out excepcyon
be put away / ne ever after be received again. And unto this purpose serves
well that is written of Moses Deuteronom ii. xxiiij If a man be married or take a
wiffe / to who^ he casts no favor be cause she has some deformite / he
shall write a libell of divorsement and geve it her in here own hands / and
so shall let here depart from his house And when she is departed and has
married an other husband / if he also hate here and will geve her a lybell of
dyvorsemente / and so demysse her from his house / or else dye: Yet may not her
first husband receave her again for his wife like wise ought also a man to do
in this case / to the end that such runnynge a way or departinge may be
reproved and condemned. For doutlesse if yt were so done all soche dyvorse and
departinge of married couples / should consequently be a bated / dymynisshed /
and left.

But now when the Pope has opened away for soche runners / and defends
their runninge and lewdenesse / gevynge them leave and au^horite to come again
and claim their first married mate / what mervaile is yt / if the world be
fulle of broken forlorn and desolate maryages / ye and replete with
fornycacyon? Which Satan has sought and studied to bring a boute through
these laws. But if both parties be found culpable in soche^ runnynge a way
or departinge: Then yt is right / that each of them do forgyve other their
offenses / and be reconcyled / and dwell again to gether And this doctrine of
Paul extends so far / that yt comprehends all manner of dyvorsemente. As
when the husband and his wife departs a so^dre the one from the other not
only because of Christian faith / but also for what soever other cause / be yt
other for anger or else for any other displeasure. So that in all soche
things the causer of dyvorse ought other to reconcyle him unto his married mate
/ or else abide unmarried: and then the party which is innocente and
fautlesse being dysmyssed and set free / shall have power / if so his mate
will not be pacifyed and come to agremente to change his estate / and mary
with an other. For this is utterly a wicked / ungodly / and hethen manner that
married folks shuld^ be separate / and goo away the one from the other / for
cause of anger or else of any other fylthy and unclean thing / and will not
rather suffer and take part to gether of good and evylle / of sweet and of
sower / like as they are bound to do. Wherefore soche married people be verily
hethen and infideles.

God (says he) has called us in peace / that is to say / that we should
spend our life in reaste and peace. So that a Christyan husband / or a
Christian wife ought not to stryve for cause of faith or vnbyleve / nor yet
depart / or go away: If that the vnbele^er will not violently pulle the
away from godliness. But every parsone ought to be suffered to abide in their
own beleve. The cause thereof referryd unto God. For unto faith no man another
can / ne ought to enforce and strain an other. Only god must draw me^ there
unto by his grace. And it is requisyte that we do teach / exhort / and pray
forth same / but co^pelle any parsone we may not Wherefore a Christian and
belevinge body ought to lyve peasably with his married companion being an
infidele / or of misbeleve as touching the exteriordedes of matrimony and not
to dystroble him another with thretennniges / departinge / ne persecucyon. For
God is not causer of strife / but of peace As is testified Roma.xv. and also in
ye.xiiij chapter of this pistle. Therefore does he not teach strife and
discord / but keeps and preserves us all unto peace. Now saint Paul
proceeds forth.

For how know thou o wo^man whether thou shalt save thy husband or not?
Other how knoweste thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife or not? But
even as god has distributed unto every man.
That is to say / ye ought therefore to keep mutual peace one with an other in
matrimony / and yt also with your wives or husbands being infideles (when they
withsta^de not / ne let you to byleve and follow christ) and not to manace /
thretne / drive and enforse the^ unto faith. For it is not in your power / ne
your deed yt one may come or turn to ye faith of christ ^ut yt comes of god
only. Seeing therefore you do not know whether god will save the^ through means
of you / or else not / you shall nourisshe peace betwyxte your selves / another
shall the husband at any time compel his wife being an infidele or
misbelever unto the right faith of christ / or else stryve with her for cause
of the same: Nea christian wife shall for it contend or braule with her
husband being an infidele. But if it shall please god through you to save the^
/ he there unto shall hel^e and aid you dealinge his grace and gifts unto to
you / which are to soche an effect belonginge. This seameth unto me the very
mind and meaning of Paul in this place: That he would have no parsone
enforced other to ye faith or godliness / but one married mate to ly^e quietly
and in ^eace with an other / vntille the time God shall change and converte
unto him by us / whom he shall please. Which thing teaches well saint
Peter in the.ij. chapter of his first pistle.

Thus must we do with a married mate that is an infidele or misbelever / his
evyll livynge of us must peaseably be suffered / another ought we to constrain
him unto faith and godlynes / but cur^eously bring him there unto with soft
entreatinge and tranquillite / for paraventure thou art unworthy that any
parsone through the should come unto goodness / or wax better: But if thou be
worthy god of his good will shall gravnte gyve the to do it. In the maene
season thou ar^ suer that thou may lefully lyve with a married mate / ye and
that though he be an infidele so long as thou do not follow his vnbylefe or
infidelyte / and evyll lyvinge / ne do there unto consent / and suffereste
not thy silfe to be compelled of him to any ungodliness. But do endure soche
wickedness and injury of thy married pertyner (even as we must suffer them of
all y^ world / and of Satan him silfe) en^reatinge him with mylde words and
peaseable lyvinge / vntille that god shall lend him grace to repent him self
and so be converted.

As the lord has called every parsone / so let him walk. And so ordeyne I in
all congregacyons.
This is the conclusion and sum of this part of matrimony. In which he
entendeth to say thus: Faith and christianite is so free a thing that it is
bound to none estate / but is preferred / rules / and reygneth in the^ all
and over them all. Wherefore a man neadeth to chose none estate for to come unto
bliss. But in what so ever estate / and condicyon / the evangly or faith shall
find the in / be thou no^ adouted but that thou maiste be saved in the same.
Therefore that thou shuldeste forsake wedlock and keep separate thy silfe from
a married mate / for cause of faith or salvacyon / it is not nedefulle.

And contrary wise that thou shuldeste be coupled in matrimony other with a
christian / or else with an infidele for cause of faith or salvacyon / is also
not nedefulle. And to tell you at ones in few words. If thou be weddid other
with a christian / or else with an infidele / thou art therefore another saved
ne condemned. Or if thou be unmarried / thou art like wise therefore another
saved ne condemned. For all these things are here free and indifferent. But
when thou shalt be a Christian / and so lyve / then shalt thou be saved / and
if thou be not a christian / but an vnbelever or an infidele / thou shalt then
be damned.

So do I ordeyne in all congregacyons / that is to say among all Christen
parsones / where I do preach the Evangely. For I do not teach yt they should
forsake their estates / and make troble or debate / but yt they should in them
continue / and pass the course of their life in peace. Mark here well / and
^hou maiste now see that Paul does leve here none estate blessed / except the
estate only of christianite or of a christen body. All other does he make free.
That of them selves they another make for salvacion ne ^et forda^nacio^: but all
they through faith be wholesome / and through vnbylefe hurtefulle or noisome / and
that even when they be best kept. What ca^ now our monks / no^nes / freres
/ and such other cloysterers here say? which do magnifye / boste / and
count their estates as ye gretteste estates of s^lvacio^ above this most
singular estate of faith and Christianite? They be all undoubted utterly
damnable / except they be left free and in mennys eleccyon. So that folks
consciences unto the^ be not bound / and that they be observed / not to
thentente that through the^ me^ should purchase bliss: but inconvenient age to
inv^^ or exercise the body. As in time coming if so god please I shall show
more largely.

If any man be called being circumcised / let him not take uncircumcision. If
any be called being uncircumcised / let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is
no thing / vncirdumcisio^ is no thing: but the kepinge of the commandments
of god is all to gether.
Here does he gather to gether certain examples of his conclusion aforesaid /
that is to wit ye every ma^ne walk acordinge after his calling. The ^irste
example is of a Jew / and of a Ge^tille. And this is ye meani^ge thereof If so
thou be circu^cided and art under ye law / thou shuldeste not deem that to be
tres^^sse and sin / so that thou therefore woldeste go from yt / for faith
does as well excelle circuncisio^ as it does all other laws. So that thou
maiste lawfully be other circuncided / or else vncircuncided. Another do
thou need other of them unto salvacyon / but each of the^ is like wise free
forth to lyve in. And to mary or else to lyve unmarried another is necessaryly
unto the requisyte: but both estates are unto the free / and in thy choice to
take wheth er of the^ thoulykeste. In like manner if thou art a Gentylle
vncircuncided / and with out the law of Moses / thou shuldeste not think /
that it is wrong and vnlaw^ulle for the so to abide stylle / or else that
thou oughteste to be circum^yded: but it is free for the to lyve as thou do
concerning these estates / and soche other / and to use whether of them both
shall please the Only faith makes the ryghtewes / which also only does
fulfylle the laws of god.

These.ij. sayings let not a man take vncircuncision / and let him not be
circuncised / ought not to be so understand as though Paul did forbydde both
circuncysion and vncircuncision. For who can observe or keep both to gether. He
should then do contraryate to be circuncysed / and also uncircumcised. And he
him silfe does heresaye yt circuncision is no thing. Which sentence should be
contrary unto this that he says / let him not chose to be vncircu^cided / for
if he ought not to take vncircucision or be vncircuncided / he ought then to be
circuncided. How may then circuncision be no thing? And by this means / this
saying vncircuncision is no thing should repugne with that he says. Let him
not be circuncided / for if he ought not to be circuncided / he must the^
chose vncircuncision / how therefore shall vncircuncision be no thing? But you
must understand that he does not here inhibite / and forfende the estate of
circuncision o^ else of vncircuncision which be corporalle and exterior
things: but he forbideth in the^ necessyte / co^pulsio^ / and conscience
making / and wills the^ to be free and i^diff^re^te / and another good ne
badde / lefulle ne vnlefulle in them sel^es: but that they be according after
they are used and like as the parsones which have the^ and do lyve in them. So
then should not a man chose to be vncircuncided as though of necessite he ^^ste
not lyve circuncised. Another contrary wise so to take circuncision / as though
by necessite he were so bound to do Another of these is worthy of bliss And
yet both of them may be suffered with out any charge and grefe of conscience.
So that to be borne a Jew or else a Gentille that is to say circu^cided or
else vncircu^cided does another help a man to god ne let him from God. But
this comes only of faith and vnbyleve.

According unto this ought also be said unto owr people. To be wedded is
nothing / and to be unwedded is nothing / To be married with an infidele or
mis belever is no thige / Also to be married with a christian is no thing. He
yt is married / let hi^ abide married / he yt is unmarried let hi^ not desyer
marriage. That is to say / let him not suffer his conscience to be greved / as
thowgh he ought other to lyve married / or else that he ought to abide
unmarried. Moreover to be a monk or a friar is no thing / Also to be a lay
man is nothing: To be a pryste is nothing. And to be a monk is like wise
nothi^ge. He therefore that is a lay man let him not be a monk / And he that
is a monk let him not be a lay man: That is to say let him not think that
he has necessite to be the one / or else the other er make any stickinge or
gradge in conscience by cause he is this or that: but let him abide the man /
that he is / and in the same estate. So that yet ^ys faith do remain pure and
sure. For where as faith ca^ not persever there necessite bi^deth as well a
monk to depart as an other man / which is called away and with drawn from
Christ by his wicked married fellow.

But here may the Jews make objection and lay against Paul. Say thou
that circumcision is nothing worth / but that the commandment of god is
all to gether. Circumcysion is straytly commanded unto us of god: how then
do thou say yt yt is no thing? This is a longer matter / then yt I ca^
now (according as yt is worthy) speak of. but I have of yt sufficiently
written in other places. Notwithstanding have ye yet now again my mind in
few words. All the laws of Moses were written and geve^ until the comi^ge
of christ / he at his coming ought both to teach and also to geve or deal
unto his servantes faith and love. Where as they be / all the commandments
and laws are fulfilled abrogate and made free. So that after the cominge of
Christ no commandment is any longer necessary / onles yt concern faith and
love. Therefore where love shall require / I shall suffer to be circu^cyded /
else I shall let yt pass. Where charity shall require anger / there am I
b^u^de to be angry / else I shall forbere and exchue yt. Where charity shall
demand to swear / there must one swear / else shall I abstain from
swea^y^ge. And so must be done in all precepts / laws / and commandments
/ both gods and man's. What charity is / and how that yt seeks the profit
and pleasure of our neyghbore and also what faith is / has been many times
showed in other places.

Let every man abide in the same state wherein he wascalled Art thou called
being a servante? Care not for yt. Nevertheless if thou may be free / use
yt rather.
He does here repete again his conclusyon / puttyng an other example
concerning the same of a servante and a free man. In that time many were as
one would say not their own men / like as now a days in certain places
besome that has no power over their own body / and are commonly called bo^de
men or flaves / These Paul does here call servantes: Therefore as in matrimony
the one party ought to use them sylfes unto the other / where as also is power
taken a way from them over their own body / evyn so ought also thrawldes and
bond men use them to ward their lord or master / in whose power they are as
concerning their bodies / and are as yt is usually said their lords very
good and possession. But yet he that is called in this state says the Apostle
let thym not care for yt: That is to say / It hyndereth him not from
godliness / ne lets in him Christian faith. Another he therefore neade to
run from his lord or master: but is bound to dwell stille with him /
whether he be a Christian or else ^n infidele / godly or else ungodly / onles
he will draw him a way from Christ and co^pelle him to follow nawghty
livinge. For the^ is yt not vnlefulle for him to depart and pyke him a way to
the^re^t he may the better live and wo^ke tha^ shall be for his salvacion And
all that is spoken a litylle before of a Christian or faythfulle person / how
that he should bear him in wedlock to ward his mate being a misbelever or an
infydele / the same ought to be repetyd / and said again here in this place /
for the behavore of a christian servante to ward his lord being an infidele.
And what soever he does speak here of him / that has no power over his own
body: The same ought also to be understand of all prentyses / iournymen /
handemaydes / women serva^tes / hyerd men / attornayes / laborers / and
generally of all ser^ant^e / touching the accomplisshemente of their masters
commandment. Ye and of all promyses / covenantes / bargenys / and of all
manner ways / by which any person may in any wise be bound unto an other
For in these all / and soche other must they perform their office / service /
duty / and promise / whether the other party be Chrystian or ^ethen good or
evyll / godly or else ungodly / so long as they go not about to pulle us
from the faith of Christ / ne spoil us of Christian livinge. For all soche
states are free / ne any whitte with standing christianite. As if the king of
Pole or Hungary had made a leage with the Turk / they were undoubted bound to
perform yt / and say as Paul does here teach: god has called us in peace.

Nevertheless if thou may be free says Paul) use yt rather
Not so that thou shalt pyke the from thy master or lord prively / and run
away. But that thou shuldeste not understand the saying of Paul / in which
he byddeth that every person do abide in the same state / wherein he is called
/ as though thou myghtest not have power over thine own body / if so thy
master or lord did wittyngly and willingly make the free and gyve the
manumission. Saint Paul will here instruct thy conscience / that thou
may know how both estates are free / whether thou be a serva^te / and
thraulde in body unto an other person / or else a free man and vnthraulde.
And this purposes he / to thente^^e he should not stop the from liberty and
fredome / if so thou may come there by with favore of thy lord and master.
So that yt should be all one / as touching unto thy conscience / whether thou
be a servante and thraulde / or else at liberty and free. If god and his
honor do so suffer and allow yt. For Chrystia^ faith does not invade and
violently take away other mennys goods / but cau^eth us to perform all
covenantes and duties / ye rather then fail to do all that we can or may /
even for them that we be not bound ne beholding unto (except by the law of
love) and to them that have no power over us.

For he that is called in the lord being a serva^te is the lords fre man.
Like wise he that is called being free / is Christ's servante.
This is no more to say / but that yt y^ all one thing before god whether thou
be bo^de or else a freman: Like as circumcysyon and vncyrcumcysion are all one
thing. Another of them does let thy faith and salvacyon: As though I should
say / In faith yt is all one matter whether thou be poor / or else rich / a
young man or an old / fayer or foul / lettred or unlettered / a lay man or
else a spretuall (as is wont to be said) white or else black For he yt is
called being poor is a fore god rich. And he yt is called ^ ionge man is
ancient in the sight of god. And he that, is called being foul and miss
favored / is a fore god fayer and beautyfulle. And he that is called being
unlearned / is before God right coninge and well learned. And be that is called
being a lay man / is before god a pryste. All this is because that faith does
make us all before god egalle and like. Ne does yt suffere division of states or
persons to be of any value. In like wise also here when he says: he that is
called in the lord being a seruante is the lords freeman. This is asmoche to
say / that he is no less recounted a fore god / then if be were free / and no
servante. Contrary wise / he that is called being free / is Ch^istes servante /
yt is to say / he is no better then a servante. Here comes well in place that
Paul says Gala^. iij. Here is another Jew / ne Greek / another bond / no fre
/ there is another man ne woman for all are one thing in Christ Jesus / ye
Christ is all and the whole in all things. We have all one faith / one god /
one inherytance / and all things are egalle and like. Thus mayeste thou
conclude / he that is called being a man / is before god as a woman / and she
that is called being a woman is before god as a man. Wherefore this word
Christ's servante in this place can not be spoken of service that is done to
christ / but yt signifies a servante that is here set under me^ in this
world. Which for so much as he also belongs unto Christ and lyveth under
him is of like reputacion unto god as if he were free. Ye he is even christ's
propre servante / in that he serves his master diligently / and faithfully for
Christ's sake and acordynge unto his commandment.

ye are dearly bough^^^ee therefore ye be not the serva^tes of men.
What means he b^ this? he has showed before / that serva^tes ought to abide
in their states / wherein they are called. And yet does he here forfende / that
we should be servantes. But ye shall know that he does here some what break of
/ and make a little d^gression from his first matter / gevinge as yt were a
generalle proverb or feate sentence against all humayne laws and tradicions.
So that not with sta^dinge this digression is so pety / that yt is in manner no
digression. For he takes occasion unto the same of that which is spoken
immediately before^ He shows before what liberty is granted by the doctrine
of Christ unto Chrystianes as concerning for matrimony / and how that faith
makes all states and things egalle. Which liberty and egalnesse caused by
faith / mennys tradicions do destroy / and avoydinge liberty do combre men's
consciences bringing them in to a strayte. For he that teaches that a
Christen body may not mary with an vnchristyan and so dwell to gether (which
thing the Popes laws are not adouted to do) the same lets and fordoeth
this lybertye that is here ordained and spoken of by Paul / and causes that
people do rather obey them / then God or else his word. And this does Paul
in this place call servyce of men / when he says / be not the servantes of
men. In so doing think the people / that they be the servantes of God / and do
obey serve and honor him. When not with standing they attendinge and
following the doctrine of men are made only the servantes of men.

The same wise did they that preached / that Christen men ought to be
circumcyded / whereby they did infrynge / and spoil exceeding many men of
spretuall liberty / which false teachers he does myghtely improve and blame in
all his Epistles / for the more part: but specially in that which he writes
unto the Galatyans / and in that he writes unto the Romans. Thus did this
blyssed Apostle always dylygently and fyersly fight for the mayntenance of
Christyan lybertye against the snares / trappes / bondage / and imprysonmente
that Jesus is Christ and beleve in thy heart that god has raised bi^ from death
thou shall be saved. Where by confession is meante witnessinge in words and
deeds outwardely / like as in heart we do truly byleve of god / and his words
inwardly. Beside forth in all other things he geveth the liberty that after
thine own will thou may do all things with out all ieoparde of
conscience. In so much that he cares no thing at all / as concerning for
him silfe / all though thou did forsake thy wife / run fro they lord or
master / and should br^ake all manner covenantes that thou makiste with all
men. For what avayleth it him if thou do this thing or yt / or else do
omit and leave them undone?

But for so much as thou art herein bound unto thy neghbore / under whose
power / and dominyon thou art put / God will not that by his lybertye thou
shuldeste invade and spoil an other mannys goods But he will that thou
shalt keep covena^tes / and promyses that are made with thy neghbore / for all
be it that as belonginge unto him silfe he takes small regard for soche
things / not withstandinge he does yet care for thy neghbores sake. And that
is his meaning when he says. Before god. As though he should say / Before
man or before thy neghbore I do not make or set the free^ For I will not
spoil him and takethe away from him which art his proper goods and
possession / v^till^ ye time that eve^ he hi^ silfe shall make the free. But
before me art thou dymissed and made free. So yt thou canste not perisshe or be
damned / what so ever thing thou shall outwardly other do / or else leave vn^
one. Mark therefore this liberte well and divide it accordingly So that thou
vndersta^deste y^^ matter to go otherwise be twixte god / and the then it goes
betwixt y^ / and thy neghbore / for in the first part y^ is to say betwixt
god and the is liberty: but in the second that is betwixt y^ and thy
neghbore is none. God gyveth the this liberty in thine own goods / but not
in ye goods of thy neghbor There is it necessary for the to make division be
twixte thy goods and thy neghbore. For this cause may not a man forsake his
wife / for his own body is not his own / but it be longs unto his wife /
and is hers. And contrary wise as co^cerninge of ye woman. In like manner also
a bond man / or a serva^te has no power over his own body / but is under the
power and authorite of his sovereine or master God as co^cerni^ge for to his
own silfe would not great ly care / if a man did forsake his wife / for ye
body is not bound unto god / but is geve^ of hi^ to man freely unto ye use of
all exterior things. But inwardely in ye heart is man bound to God Bargaynes
and promyses made unto men ought to be universally accomplisshed. The very
conclusion hereof is^ That we owe nothing unto any man / saving love only / and
through love to be servisable unto our neghbore. Where love is / it rules /
and claymeth by authorite (with out all ieoparde of conscience or of sin
before god) to eat to d^inke to be clothed with all manner of garments / to
use this / or else that manner of lyvinge indifferently / savinge^ where they
should hurt my neghbore and be against his profit. Against god in soche
manner of things can not one offend / but thou maiste against thy neghbore /
onles thou do^st use them right. Moreover yt by this word / calling / is not
here signified the state in which every man is called / And as yt is usually
said. Matrymony is thy calling / Thy calling is prystehode / and forth in
rewe of other. Every man has his proper calling of God. Of soche calling
does not Paul speak here / but he notes the Evangelike cally^ge / that is by
the Evangely. So that this sentence / Abide in ye calling ^^^rin thou art
called is thus much to say. In what so ever state ye eva^gely shall take ye
and what so ever manner man yt it shall find the. Se yt in ye same thou do
abide. If it call y^ being married / continue so stille / abidinge in ye same
calling or state / wherein yt did find the. If it called the being a servante
/ abide in the servyce in which thou warte called.

What? If then yt shall take me in a synfulle state / shall I so stille abide
and remain? I answer: if thou be in faith and charity / that is to say if
thou be in the calling of the Evangely. Do what shall please the. Do thou
then sin hardely: But by what ways shalt thou can sin / if thou have
faith and charity? For by faith we must please and serve God / and by charity
our neghbore. Therefore it ca^ not be / that thou shalt be called in a
synfulle state / and there in remain / for if thou do so remain / other
thou art not yet called / or else thou haste not rec^aved thy calling / for
this calling dout^lesse causes that thou must depart from out of a synfulle
state in to an other / that is synles and does altre the in soche wise that
thou canste after do no more sin / all though thou shuldeste abide in the
first state. And all be it that thou be then clearly on all parties free a
fore god / yet a fore men must thou by charity be every bodies servante.

Here do thou see the^ again / that cloisters and monasteryes which are now
a days do fight again right and equity / for they bind them selves unto god
in exterior things / in which they be clearly free / and so do they strive
against god / faith / liberty / and gods ordinance. And again ward
wherein they ought to be bound / and be s^rviable unto every man by charity /
there do they make them selves free / and will use liberty. So that they will
not be servyable ne profit any man / but them selves. In which manner of
doing they resist / and with stand the truth. O what weywarde / and
disordered ordres be these / which will perverte / and destroy all the
ordinances and laws of god / desyringe to be f^ee in y^ they stand bound and
to be bound where they stand free. And yet not withstanding they claim of
presump^yon to have thrones or seats of excellent honor in heve^ /
dysdayninge the places ordained for other comone Christen people. Ye they
shall occupye seats that are appointed for them in the deppe dongone of hell
which so does make of hevenly liberty develisshe bondage / and of corporalle
servitute cursed lybertye.

The third part which entreats of vyrginite. As concerning vyrgins I have
no cammaundeme^te of the lord / yet I do geve councelle as one that has
obtained of the lord to be faithfulle. I suppose that it is good for the
present necessyte / for it is good for a man so to be.
We have hither to hard matrimony ple^teously magnifyed and praised / let us
now hear the pains and trobles thereof / and of the dignite and honor of
virginite. This will I here note unto you first / onles yt had been saint
Paul that here does entreat the^of / yt might greve men that he is soche a
spare prayser thereof / and that he does so slenderly commend yt. First he
says that yt is not commanded of god / no more than is matrimony / that is
to say / yt is left of god free for every person. And in that is taken away
the honor / which our great preachers have there unto a fore this time
attributed. For where is no commandment / there is left before god another
merit ne mede / but a sole liberty. Yt is of like estymacion before god / and
all on matter whether thou be a virgyne or no virgin. And as he showed before:
He that is called being a servante is the lo^des freman. Like wise may be
said here: She yt is called being a maid is before god a wife And she that is
called being a wife / is before god a maid. For all these things before god
are all one another is there any difference of persons / ne merit of deeds /
but only faith which is egalle and like in all / and by all things.

Paul because that virginite is a dear and a precious thing and of great
authorite in the earth spoke this by the holy ghost / to the^tent that no man
for ye preeminence and soveraynte of the state should judge him sylfe better
and more excellent before god then an other simple ch^ysten body: but that he
should continue pure in faith which does make us all egalle in the sight of
god. For ^he corrupt nature of man can not abide / as a man would say to be
vntwynded and to be counted nothing in value a fore god / and therefore the
more excellent that her work shall be / the more excellent reioyseth she to
appear. Wherefore she is so blinded with the goodly glysteringe of virginite.
Seeing that there is no thing more of price / n^ more glorified upon earth. That
she demeth no state to be so soverayne as yt. And so proceeding she thinks in
hyrmide suerly that like as in the world a virgyne does exc^lle a married body
/ even so shall yt be in heven.

Here in have you both uttered / and also overthrowen the dyvelyshe doctrine of
the braynles and dotynge doctores or preachers of the devyll which do forge
syngular coronettes for nonnes and all virginnes in heven / calling them the
spouses of Christ. As though other Chrystyan people were not the spouses of
Christ. miserable and folysshe youth hearing this lewd preachinge runs
who may fasteste covetyng to fylle and replenisshe heven with vyrgines and the
spouses of Christ. In the mean season Christian faith is forgotten and not
cared for / but suppressed and quenchidde. Which notwithstanding all only
does finally obtain this crown / and makes the spouses of Christ. But know
thou well this / and be thou suer that of soche crowned vyrgines (that trust
in these doctrines / and by reason of soche opinions do show and pretend
virginite / dyspysinge / or slenderly regardinge this doctrine of Paul) is not
so much as one found pure or remayninge a virgin / and finally that is a
vyrgyne or else the spouse of Christ.

Furthermore he says according after his faythfulle and trusty advysemente
that virginite is good for this present necessite. This is the first
co^mendacyon that Paul brings of virginite. And here may thou see what
goodness Paul did mean of before in the beginni^ge of this chapter / when he
sayede / yt is good for a man not to touch a woman. For he wrytteth not here
one word of merit / mede / or reward that we shall have in heven.

But he spoke of transitory goodness and co^modites of this life / as here after
we shall see more often. This is then a good cause to continue in virginite
and to eschew marriage which is fulle of troble and miseries. That always over
the shulders of a Christian body hangs ready for love of the Evangely
persecucyon / and he is every hour as men are wont to say set as it were
betwixt ye hammer and ye stethy so yt he must put in ieoparde his goods / his
fryndes / and his life other to be dryven and taken away / or else to be
slain. And this does Paul here call present necessite.

But now where I beseech you shall one can find so much as one virgin in
all the cloysteres of the Popes kingdom (for in soche does he principallye
reygne) yt lyveth a virgin for soche a cause? For then possessions / life /
and company be made so sure / and safe by so many and so great pryvyledges /
and authoritees both of kings / Emperoures / and of Popes that never a fore
unto this day was any people in the world more safe / or more sure. So that
every man must needs knowledge and grant that these do not lyve virgynes for
cause of necessite / or of any ieoparde / but only for love of sykernesse /
assurance / and savetye / and that no necessite should ever touch ne assail
them. Which thing is clean contrary unto the cause alleged here of Paul /
for if everywhere in cloysteres and monasteries necessite / and persecucio^
should be looked for / ye should se expressly that where as now are ready bylded
a thousand and a thousand cloisters / should uneaths be one stock or studde
But what shall I need tarry any longer about to declare you this. It is
plainly set a fore the eyes of all me^ / what necessyte and peril cloysteres
/ their god the pope / with all his officers / mynisters / clyentes / and
accessaries do suffer / other in body / or in goods. They be all in a gross
sum swyne and sowes that are masted / pampered / and fed delicately.

But thou will here obiecte against me Married people ought to be in peril
and necessite for the euangely / as well as virgins or unmarried persons. For
as the euangely is unto all people comone / so must also the cross and
persecucion be. For Abraham was in necessite and to gether also with^him his
wife Sara / which when he had forsaken his father and his goods or substance
was caused to be always put in ieoparde of death? I make answer. Yet for all
that does not Paul command that any person for cause of that necessite
should te bound to abide syngle and unmarried. But he says ye yt is good and
profitable so to abide. This necessite that Paul does here speak of is a
comone thing. But virgyns be in better case to abide and endure yt then are
married folks. For if Abraham had been without his wife Sara / he should have
had less / troble labor / and care / and should in co^clusyon have escapyd
with more ease the perils and ieoperdes yt he was in. A virgyne is onl^ one
body / and has no need to care for any other. But married folks do abide to
gether and are joined the one unto the other. Here in is much troble care
thought and study like as / experience does abundantly show. But at this
thing I think many will be displeased / frown / and wax angry s^yng that
they so long time have causeless kept chastity / and yet before god shall be
no better then all other. But in so doing you shall see yt they be y^ ^olisshe
virgins which did spylle their oil / by cause yt they did lyve and continue
virgins not of pure Christian mind / but for love of mede / reward /
excellency / honor / and glory And they do not recke^ that yt is good so to
abide virgins as Paul does here say and mean yt is good / but they d^eame
yt they shall obtain thereby some good t^inge in the life cominge. And thus
have they made of their virgi^ite marcha^dise / yt they shall there by have
lucre and winninge before god / and will not be co^te^te with ye tra^sitory
goods that do come of chastity and eternalle inheritance purchased by faith.
Wherefore soche must here with be neades offended and displeased For beside yt
they shall be disapoynted of the preeminence that they looked to have had in heven
/ yt was also very ^revous / pain fulle / and laborous for them to keep this
chastity vain and damnable.

Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a
wife? seek not a wife: But and if thou take a wife / thou haste not sinned /
like wise if a virgin marye / she has not sinned: Nevertheless soche shall
have troble in their flesh: but I faver you.
Here haste thou both that it is no sin to mary / ne yet to lyve unmarried.
The Apo / +stle entendeth principally to inform me^nes consciences / and
afterward to show what is most expedient and best for people in this
world. And wherefore to lyve unmarried is good / he does here describe with
words of great gravite sayng: Married folk must have troble in the flesh.
And this is the cry / and noise / that all the world does make / speak / and
write of / touching matrimony / that no man which loves to lyve at ease and
pleasure may gyve him silfe to be married / for in it is much troble vexacyon /
miserye / evyll days / and adversite Which all they that are virgins and
unmarried do not feale / and be with out. But I that am as yet vnexperte. And
that have had none experience of matrimony^ not her will / ne yet can / here
rehearse and reckon ye pains / grefe / and labors / that thereof come.

Nevertheless I gyve here credence unto Paul. And of scripture I have
learned.ij. tribulacions of marriage. The first is when god spoke unto Adam.
Genesis.iij. say^ge. In the sweat of thy vysage shal^e thou ^ate thy bread /
and with the penury or barennes of the earth shalt thou no^isshe the in the
days of thy life. There was misery put apo^ manki^de to mayntene and norisshe
both him silfe and his wife. Here is faith assailed sharply / and put unto no
lytill plu^ge For what a grevous burdon do they bear when they be pinched and
wrong with penury? Beside what a vexacio^ is it for the^ to behold the
misfortunes that be fall both unto themselves / and also unto their householde
and family / with the iopardye yt they do daily stand in / of losinge both
gods and cattelle? Finally what angwisshe do they suffer / seeing and feling
the wilenesse / and falsshede of me^ among who^ they are compelled to lyve
and company with? Thus must he humble hi^silfe most louly / keeping hi^ quiet
and stille / and brouke or disgeste down many evil vexacions / and that
principally because he is bound in wedlock with a wife / which things all
he should lytelle or nothing need to regard / if so he were loose and stood
free. Forthermore the woma^nes myserye and affliction is to bear childer / to
be delyvered of them in pain / and to bring them up in labor and travayle /
to rest or sleep litelle in the night / to be strayte and hard unto her silfe
/ and to forsake all her felicite or pleasure. Which thing she should have no
need to do / if she had lyved a maid. And this beside all experience did God
him silfe show unto Eve in the.iij. chapter of Genesis sayng: In pain shalt
thou bear and bring forth children. The other tribulacyon of marriage is / that
saint Peter touched sayng: That a woman is weacke and a bryttelle vesselle. So
that the h^sbande must fuffer / and forbere many things in her: if so they
will lyve in rest and concord. For fault of this we see that joyful /
matrimony (in which peace does reygne and love) is a seldom found thing.
Again ward the woman ought to be subject and obedient unto her husband / as
thou seys^e Genesis.iij. to go forth after him / to abide and be with him
whersoever it shall please o^ like him. So that she must needs many times
brydelle and break her own will. If beside forth thou desireste to know of
other inco^modites / and troble yt is in mat^imony / thou maiste if so thou ^
will axe of the^ yt have assayed it / or else assaye it thy silfe. I suppose
verily yt these.ij. be wond'fulle great tribulacio^s. And the more great / by
people be chaste in by mennys tradycyons.

That this is here the mind of Paul / confermeth well the other part of his
proverb / when he says you be dearly bought. In which he sygnyfyeth Christ
/ that with his precious blood has redemyd and delyvered us from all sins
and laws / as is clearly showed in his Epistle ^o the Galathyans.v. chapter.
Now was this byeng and redempcyon done not after the worldely fassyon. Another
be here made leages and covenantes / soche as are betwyxte men: soche as be
betwyxte the servante and the master / the wife and her husband. All soche
bargeynes does he let stand stille / willinge that they should be kept / and
observed. But this redempcyon is done inwardlye by the sp^ete in mennys
conscyences: So that no law can any longer bind us or keep us bound: But
here are we all in all wise frank and free. Before we were kept bound and
locked in sin: but now are all sins fordone / broken / and destroyed. But
yet all bondage or lybertye exterior does stille abide and remain / and is
another sin ne goodness or merit: but a certain exteryor order of things in
due frame and proporcio^ of troble and solace / pain and joy / like a^ all
other exterior and outward things be. In which on both sides we may lefully
pass through our life with out sin.

Brethren let every man wherein he is called / theri^ abide with God.
here does he now the third time repete his conclusion of christian lybertye.
That all exterior things before god are free / and that a Christen body may
use them according after his appetite or pleasure / other levinge the^ or
else taking them. And he adds expressly / before god. That is to say as
concerni^ge unto thy silfe and unto God. For thou do not honor unto god in
this that thou art coupled in matrimony / or else that thou abydeste unmarried
/ that thou art a servant / or else that thou art a freman. In that thou art
made this thing or that / or else do eat this meat or yt. On the other
side thou do not displease him / another do thou sin if any of these
things thou shalt do away and leave dndone. And to tell you shortly. Thou
oweste nothing unto god / but faith and confession / when I bear / say
confession. I mean not that whysperinge of sins in to ye prystes ear /
which is called auricular confession / ne yet the confession of thy sins
unto god / but I mean as saint Paul does Roma. x. saye^ge: If thou shall
knowledge or confess with thy mouth / that cause they co^prehe^de in the^ many
other. But yet is all this another sin ne offense before god / but only a
te^poralle inco^modite / vexacion / and misery the which he must needs feel /
ye other lusts or else by necessite is enforsed to be joined in matrimony.
And with out doubt ye apostle has therefore here touched these greves / and
vexacions of matrimony / less any parsone should for cause of the^ despise ye
state / as though it pleased not god or in which god could not be served. Like
as unto this day our false prophets have be^ wont to do. Which have in
manner put all worshuppinge of god / and good deeds / out of this state /
calling married people / secularlaye / worldely / ye and the very world yt
silse / and other that lyve unmarried / but yet not all chaste spretuall
ecclesiasticalle / and the church. As though they only were spretualle and the
church. And the married were not so / but the contrary / ye they call the
unmarried the knights of god / god dys servantes / the spouse of god and soche
other names which it is pitye to se how far they be disagreyng from their
deeds and co^dicions. What else is this then in so avauncinge themselves in yt
they be unmarried to teach that in marriage me^ can not be like? Ne do the same
that they do being unmarried.

Therefore Paul less the virgins and unmarried should by his saing take
occasion so to rouse and magnifye the^ silfes unto the dishonor of marriage /
does here mervelously te^per and modifie his words saing. S^che shall have
troble in their flesh. Mark how expressly he speaks saying troble in
flesh / not in sprete. For troble of ye sprete is sin and evyll conscience.
But troble of flesh is exterior pain / grefe / woo / and vexacion: And yt
Paul after the manner of the hebrew speech does here call the flesh / we
do call the body. So that troble of the flesh is as much to sa^e as troble
of ye body. I mean not that it is in the body as a disease / or malady is in
the body. But that troble is in these / things which we daily occupye / use /
and be co^versante with / and in all that belongs unto the body / as are our
wife / chyldre / householde / house / land / cattelle / and other movable
goods / and all manner matters or busynes that we have to do with men in this
vngracyo^s world.

A man therefore unto whom is geven the gift of chastity has need to keep in
and refrain his curiosite / and beware of matrimony / and not to put him silfe
in soche troble / and miserye. Onles necessite does compelle him / like wise as
Saint Paul does faithfully here geve council and always ought the same to
be stille geven. For it is a very great and excellent fredom and liberty to
be unmarried / exempte from much and many cares / troble / misery / and
vexacyons. Which liberty Paul does forbydde or envye no parsone sayng. But I
gladly do favore you. Behold yt this is to preach virginite truly / not to
bring forth and allege the excellentcy thereof / and mede or deservinge
before god: but to commend the tranquillite and quiet / that thereby does come
in this world. For a man shall find some that of curiosyte only and rasshenes
are copuled in matrimony with out all necessyte / that else might well have
been with out marriage. Which being uncompelled do stryve / wrestyll / and
l^boure to get and obtain mysery. When they have yt thus once purchased and
obtained / they be then truly not vnrighte we^^y dealte with all / but served
acordi^gly

This say I brethren the time is short / yt remains that they which have
wifes be as though they had none: and that they that weep be as though they
wept not: and that they that rejoice be as though they reioysed not: And that
bye / as though they possessed not: And they that use this world / as though
they used yt not / for the fassion of this world goth away.
This is a comone rule for all christian p^op^^ that they should keep and
observe there everlastinge goods and treasure / which they do possess in
faith: and that they might despise and take light regard of this life. So that
they be not drouned over deep in love or pleasures / care / or fylthynes thereof
/ and that they should here lyve / and order the^ silfe as palmers or pilgrymes
of the world vsinge all things while they be in this short passege of life
present / not for voluptuousnes and pleasure / but as is required of
necessite. And this is to have a wife as though I had her not if with desyer of
mi^de I had rather want and be with out her. Nevertheless by cause of
avoydynge sin / she is unto me necessary / and I have need of her. But he
that seeks in her not only necessite / but also pleasure and volupte this man
shall rightewesly be said not to have a a wife: but to be possessed and had of
a wife. The same wise ought a christian man to do in all other things: that is
to wit only case supporte / and succurr^ with them his necessite / and not to
follow his appetite / pleasure / and volupte or and pa^^re / and feed in the^
his old adame

I would have you with out care. The single man cares for things of the lord
/ how he may please the lord: but he that has married cares for things of
the world / how he may please his wife There is difference between a virgyn
and a wife. The single woman cares for the things of the lord that she may
be pure both in body and also in sprete: but she that is married cares for
things of the world / how she may please her husband.
Here is showed an other co^modite and profit yt comes of chastity in this
world. That they may ye more inte^tively care and study to do godly things
and gods service I mean not in reding / soundi^ge of organes / and singi^ge
/ like as now a days supersticious / religious and cloisterers are wo^te to do
among who^ is al y^ very service and honor of god suppressed and que^chidde:
But that by a blisshed quietness a man may stick hard and geve dilige^te
atte^da^ce daily unto ye word of god in redinge prayng / and always talkinge
thereof / and finally in preachi^ge it: according as paul does exhort.i.
Timo. iiii. for a parsone yt is married ca^ not geve hi^ silfe thereunto wholly:
but is distracte therefore and divided / yt is to say: he has need to spe^de a
great part of his life so to order hi^ silfe yt he may acordi^gly live with
his wife: and is like as Martha was / combred and inta^gled with many charges /
and much bussynesse. A maid or an unmarried body is not distracte and so
divided in to diverse charges or cares / but she may wholly geve her silfe unto
godly and divine things:

Yet does not the apostle intend to damn matrimony / though here he say yt a
married parsone does not only take care for the world: but also that he is in a
manner divided from god / and endures much care: So that he can not
continually pray / study / or speak the word of god. For all though truly
soche a parsones care and labor be not evil Nevertheless it had been more
profitable for him if he had abydden loose and free both as concerning for
prayer / and also for treatinge and speakinge the word of god / furthermore in
vtteringe the word of God he may do pro^ite / and conforte many me^ / ye all
christendom. So this ought to be even a very mighty and an excellent cause to
pluck back every parsone that has the gift of chastity from maryynge. But
our spretualle people which another knows the ways to pray ^e yet teaches
ye word of god / but only do torme^te themselves after the form of me^nis
statutes and traditions should do better / the^ they have done before time ye /
and that not a little better / if they were married. And whiles they do now
mu^bylle / houle and singe in chirches / they did diligently inform / nurtre /
order / and rule their wife and their children that they should live according
to the institucio^ of god declared in ye scriptures / and so provide yt they
might have meat / drink / and clotinge aco^dinge for the necessite of their
body.

This speak I for your profit and not to tangle you in a snare: but for that
which is honest and comely unto you. And that you may quietly cleave unto God
with out distraction or separacion.
That is to say I do not command chastity / but I leave it unto your
liberty: another do I s^ councelle it to be received / yt you ^ught to be
ashamed / if you do chose to ^e married rather then to lyve chaste and unmarried.
For I will have no parsone i^tangled there with / or bound there to. I do only
say and afferme ye virginite is a free / a good / and a profitable thing. Be
that will and can take yt may take it / and lyve therein. Here do you see that
in this matter ought to be laid no trappe ne snare: ne no man ought to be unto
chastity strayned and enforced another by commandments or laws / ne yet by
vows and promises. Now is this a suer matter / y^ these words ar w^it^e^ of
Paul unto ^ll Christian people of Corinthe universally / and not only to the
vnlet^red or lay. And yet he alleges no mede nor merit of virginite before
god / but only yt it is good and profitable for people livi^ge in ye world /
and this only does he praise and commend in it / as you have largely heard
showed before.

if enyman think that yt is uncomely for his virgyne if she pass the time of
marriage / and if so need require / let him do what he lists: let them be
coupled in matrimony.
This is a much wonderfulle text / that a man may gyve his virgyne or his
maid to be married only for avoydinge shame or skorni^ge which do thereof grow /
yt in some countrees yt has be thought uncomely / if a man should keep his
virgyne unmarried over long / or beyond time of marriage. Behold here as
saint Paul would have every person in this point free / and to do that
should be good and profitable for them. He says therefore if so need require /
That is to say / if it ca^ be none other wise / and the manner of yowr cowntry
be so / and the custom does with you so require that yt be shame for a man to
reteyne and keep his vyrgine until she wax aged / let him then do what he
lyketh. Let him bestow her in marriage / or else let hi^ dyspice and set
nawghte by shame. And thus to teach is verily not to esteem excedingly of
virginite / ne to recounteyt over greatly dear and precious. For the Apostle
does here ^yve leave unto a man to bestow and put forth his vyrgine to be
married for love of avoydinge a little shame or skorni^ge. I wene he was ygnora^t
of golden dya^^mes and crowns / which god is bound to gyve unto y^ merit of
virginite / like as our masteres do feign / and have ymagi^ed

Nevertheless he that purposes surely in his heart havinge no need / but has
power over his own will: and has so decreed in his heart / that he will keep
his vyrgen / does well.
A lytelle before when he said: if any man think yt yt is uncomely for his
virge^. etc. And also in this place when he says. Nevertheless he yt
purposes and has decreed in his heart y^ he will keep his virge^ / you must
understand yt h^ speaks of pare^tes / fryndes and of tutores in whose ward
and custody the vyrge^s be. In which thing is signified yt me^nys chyldre
ought not of their own rasshe mi^des to bind the^ other unto marriage / or yet
unto syngle lyving and chastity. But yt these persons under whose tuicion and
authorite they be put ought to bestow the^ in marriage / or else to reteyne
and keep the^ therfro. But if so be y^ soche do lack / or else take no keep
or regard of the^ / then may they do as they like. And that he does here
speak and bring in / of the power of his own will / yt ought to be so
understand / that no man has power to reteyne and keep his virgin from
marriage against her will. For when she will not / the^ has he no power over
his own will. In like manner if any other cause were that he should of other
men be enfo^ced to put her forth and bestow her in marriage / as in example if
he should be ashamede that his virgen were over much grown in age / or else
that he should be constrained of his friends / or of some rulers to cause her
to be m^ryed. In all soche causes ought he not to attempt any thing against
her will.

So then he that joins his vyrgen in marriage / does well And he that joins
not his virgen in marriage / does better.
Here again is expressly showed authoryte and power geven unto fathers / and
mothers / tutors / and fryndes over their chyldre / and over them / which are
committed unto there protection / and custody. That the chyldre with out the
will or consent of their pare^tes / and of other which have cure over them /
may nether marye or else abide unmarried / furthermore yt / has been
sufficiently expounded unto you before that this well / and better / which he
does h^re speak of / and that is also spoken of before in this pr^sente
chapter ought to be understand of goodness in t^is world. So that you shall
know matrimony to be good / yt is to say with out sin / acceptable unto god
and free for every person / But yet chastyte / and syngle lyvi^ge is more
quiet / and has more liberty.

The wife is bound unto the law so long as her husband lyveth. if her
husband sleep she is at liber^ye to mary with whom she will / only in the
lord but she is happyar if she so abide in my indgemente. And I think verily
that I have the sprete of god.
This place does he also rehearse Romans vij^ and thereof he makes a spretualle
allegory / which he does here omit / and leave out / but there he declares
yt largely. The end and conclusyon of this chapter is: That matrimony in the
sight of the world is a bo^de and thraulde thing: but before god yt is right
frank and free. Like as he said before of a servante / that h^ is free a fore
god / all be yt that before the world he has no power over his own body. But
syngle and unmarried folk be free both before god / and also the world / and
holden captyue of no man. Therefore he calls the state of so^he letter / or
more blessed / then is the state of the^ which are married: Not because of
coming to eternalle salvacion and bliss / where unto faith only is good and
precious / better and more precious acordi^ge unto y^ mesure thereof / but
touching unto this present life and cause of yt / for so much as in chastity
and syngle lyving is less / business / care / charge / ieoparde / and
labor. Therefore gross and content of this chapter is: It is good not to
mary / except necessite constraneth and causes the contrary. And there is
necessite where as god has not geve^ the noble gift of chastity / for no man
ne woman is create unto chastity: but all ar create / and made to engrendre and
begette issue / and to suffer the troble / and myseries of wedlock / as is
showed Genesis.ij. and.iij. But if any parsone may be reckened / and nombrede
from out of this necessite / that all mankind is create unto him has not
another law ne vow nor yet any purpose of mind exempte therfroe / but the
grace of God only / and his marvelous hand / or power. By which if man be not
made continent and chaste. I do not deny / but they may begin to live
chaste: but it shall never come to a good effect and end. Wherefore they play
the cruelle tyrannes and soul murderers / that do bar in and shut youth up
in cloisters / there keeping them in by vyolence / As though chastity did
consiste in our power / when not withstandinge they both think and also in
themselves feel the contrary. And so they b^i^ge other to that / which they
did never touch so much as with one of their fingers / nor yet ca^ though
they would never so fame^ It is shortly said / Be chaste. But why the^ art
thou o fornicator? It is a gaye matter you may be suer. Thou shalt farse / and
stuff thy body with delicate meats and drinks / in soch^ a manner that yt
shall be a main draffe sack or swylle belly / and then put or enjoin me to
fast all the days of my life / and to keep abstinencye. Finally unto them
that be a^^entyfe and wylling to hear / have I in this treatise said / and
written sufficient: But as concerning them that have no lust but disdain to
hear / what ca^ or else may men say? I beseech god to illumine them / and
lend unto them his light / or else to let and forbydde them that (as a fore
this they have done) here after they may no longer slay and murdre mennys
souls.

Amen.
