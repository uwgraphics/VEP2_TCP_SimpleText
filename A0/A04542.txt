To the Christian reader, grace and peace from Jesus Christ our Lord.
GReat strife there is at this day, about the ministry of the Church of
England, whether it be the same that Christ has ordained in his Testament, or
an other. And many by conference, some also by vvriting, have controverted this
question. There coming to my hands, these two Letters follovving, the one
written in defense of the said ministry, the other as answer thereto, and
disproving the same: I have thought them meet and needful to be published for
thy good (gentle reader) that the truth in this point may appear. Neither will
they that vvrote these things, blame me for thus doing (I trust), seeing the
matter (...) off it own nature publik, and concerns al men: 2. besides both
of them doubtless have set down that which they are persuaded is the
truth, and which they would vvish others with them to receyve and follovv:
3. and sundry copies [especially of the first letter] are already spread abroad
in vvriting unto the hands of many.

The ground and occasion of these letters (as I understand and as may be
perceived also by the writings themselves) was this. The^e was a
gentlevvoman imprisoned, because she would not join with the public
ministry of England in the worship of God. She being much solicited to the
contrary, gave in vvriting, a reason of that her faith and practice, to one Mr
A: H. a minister, and a man very learned. The reason was this (as may also be
seen (...) the letters follovving).

Whosoever he be that deals with the holy things of God and works upon the
consciences of men, by virtue of an Antichristian power office and calling, him
the people of God ought not to receive and join themselves unto.

But all the ministers that stand over the Church-assemblyes in England, deal
with the holy things of God and work upon men's consciences, by virtue of an
Antichristian power office and calling:

Therefore the people of God ought not to receive them, or join themselves
unto them.

Unto this argument Mr H. made answer by a letter unto her which follovveth.
The letter she communicated with some of her friends: they together advised
to get it auns^^ered: which was obtained of one Mr. F: Io. prisoner for the
same cause: who also directed (...) answer to the foresaid gentlevvoman.
Both of these (with some fevv other things) are (...) set forth for thy
benefit (good reader) that comparing one with an other, and vveyghing things
by the word of truth, thou may discern the right, through the help of God
and (...) of his grace, which it shall be thy duty instantly to crave, that so
knovving his heaven* (...)vvil in these things, thou may also be blessed,
doing the same. John. 13. 17.

Farevvell.
Desire the peace of Jerusalem: let them be prospered that love thee.
Let peace be in thy fort, tranquillity in thy palaces.
Because of my brethren and my fellow-friendes,
I will speak now, peace in thee.
Because of the house of the Lord owr God,
I will seek-out good for thee.

set in the Church, as Lord and King thereof: Unto them he gives by his SPIRIT
sufficient diversity of gifts and ablility for the ordinary works of teaching,
exhorting, governing, distributing etc: And being GOD he works by and in them
all, to the praise of his Name and salvation of his elect. 1 Cor 12. 4. 5. 6.
7. 8. 18. 28. and 14. 37. Romans 12. 7. 8. Mat 18. 17-20. and 28. 18. 19. 20.
Ephesians. 4. 8. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. and in the other Scriptures noted before.

Let like evidence and warrant from the Scriptures be showed for the several
offices and functions now had and exercised in the Church of England: Otherwise
all men may know they are not from heaven, but of men.

A few positions briefly containing the sum of the cause and treatise
following.
1 THat Jesus Christ is King and Lord of his Church: and that all which look
for salvation by him are bound to yield obedience to him, as in all other
things which he has commanded, so also in his ordinance of Ministry,
Worship, and Government prescribed in his Testament, and no other. Mat. 28. 19.
20 1 Timothy 6. 13. 14. 15 16. with Heb. 5. 9. and 12. 28. 19. 29. Ioh. 3. 36.
Gal. 1. 8. 9. and 3. 15. 1 Cor. 12. 5. and 14. 37. 38. Act. 3. 22. 23. and 5.
31. Esa. 60. 12. Rev. 22. 18. 19.

2. That Christ as head and lord of his Church has given unto it for the
instruction guydance and service thereof, the offices of Pastors, Teachers,
Elders, ^eacons and Helpers, together with rules for their entrance,
administration, and maintenance. Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 15. 16. Romans 12. 7. 8. 1.
Cor. 9. 14. and 12. 28. Act. 6. 2 -- 6, and 14. 23. 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. The
epistles to Timothy and Titus.

3. That the Primitive Churches were by the Apostles planted in this way and
order, as being the only true way and order appointed by Christ, and to be
observed to the end of the world. Romans 12. 7. 8 1 Cor. 12. 28. and 14. 37. Act.
6. 2. 6. and 11. 30. and 14. 23. and 20. 17. 28. Phil. 1. 1. Col. 2. 5. 1 Pet.
5. 1. 2. 3. Iam. 5. 14. Tit. 1. 5. etc. 1 Timothy 3. and. 5. and 6. 13. 14. with
Rev. 22. 18. 19. Mat. 28. 20.

4. That since the time of the Primitive Churches thus planted, Antichrist that
man of sin (as was foretold) has made departure from this way and order of
Christ, not only in other points of doctrine, but also in the Ministry,
^orship, and Government of the Church. Whereupon is come to pass, that in
stead of the former offices appointed by Christ, have crept in the Locusts of
Antichrist, Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeaeo^s, Chauncelors, Commissaryes,
Parsons, Vicars, Priests, and the rest of that ^ort, together with their new
and strange entrance, administration, and maintenance. 2 These. 2. 3. 4. 7 --
12. Rev. 9. 1 -- 11. and 13. 11 -- 18. and 14. 9. 10. 11. and 18. cap. 1. Tim.
4. 1. 2. 3. compared with the Scriptures alleged in the former positions.

5. That the Nations of the earth, and this among the rest, have been made drunk
with this cup of Babels fornications: Whereof whosoever drunketh, God has
threatened they shall also drink of the cup of his wrath. Rev. 17. 1 -- 5. and
18. 3. 4. 2 These. 2. 10. 11. 12. Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11.

6. That this nation has (to the praise of God, and honor of her Majesty) ben
purged from many of the abominations and false doctrines of Babylon aforesaid,
but not from the Prelacy and other Ministry, worship and government of the
Church by Archbishops, Lordbishops. Archdeacons, Commissaryes, Priests,
Parsons, Deanes, Prebendaryes, Canons, etc. (...) is evident by their present
estate: and by these reasons follovving.

First, if all the false ministry, worship, and tyranny of Antichrist wers in
all other places of the world abolished, yet so long as this Prelacy and other
Clergy and worship aforesaid remains in this land, Antichrist that son of
perdition were not utterly consumed: As the Scripture testifyeth he shall be by
the light of the Gospel before Christ's coming at the great day. 2 These. 2. 3.
8. with Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. and 18. 19. and Ierem. 50. and 51. cap.

Secondly, the Churches of Antichrist cannot be compleet in all the Canonical
functions, Prelacy, and Ministry of Antichrist, if they have not the
functions, Prelacy, and Ministry of Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons,
Priests, and the rest now had and retained in the Land. This is proved by the
Popes Canons and Pontifical, and by their Church constitution.

Thirdly, the Churches of Christ may be compleet in the whole ministry,
worship, and government appointed by Christ to his Church, and yet be always and
altogether without the present ministry, worship, and government by Archbshops,
Lordbishops, Archdeacons, Priests etc. now had and retained in this Land. This
is proved by the constitution of the Primitive Churches planted by the
Apostles: Which (the Scripture shows) were compleet in the former, and yet
never had nor knew these latter. Romans 12. 7. 8. Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 13. Act. 14.
23. and 20. 17. 28. 1. Cor. 12. 28. Col. 2. 5. Phil. 1. 1. Tit. 1. 5 -- 9. 1 Timothy 3. and 5. cap. and 6. 13. 14. 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. 12.

Fourthly, if that which is had in this Land were the true Ministry, worship,
and government ordained by Christ in his Church, then ought all the Churches of
Christ upon earth to use the same (Mat. 28. 18. 19. 20. 1 Timothy 6. 13. 14. 1
Cor. 4. 17. and 12. 5. and 14. 37. Jude. ver. 3. Rev. 22. 16. 17. 18. 19.): But
even the Prelates themselves and their Proctors confess it is and may be
otherwise. VVhitg. in the preface of his last book against T. C. Also the
Answer to the Abst^act: page 58.

Finally, if that which is had in this Land were the true Ministry, worship,
and government appointed by Christ to his Church, then might it be found in the
word of God: But that can it not. If any be otherwise minded, let them show the
several offices, entrance, administration, and maintenance of the Prelacy and
other Ministry of these assemblyes out of the Scriptures and Testament of
Christ.

If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in
them. Esa. 8. 20.

THE ENTRANCE OF THE LETTER. Section. 1.
GIve me leav to apply that to you (whom I take to be a Sister, and whose
vvelfare in the Lord I heartily desire) which the Apostle Iam. 1. 19. 20. 21.
vvriteth to the Brethren, Iam. 1. 19. Let every man be swift to hear, slow to
speak, and slow to wrath. 20. For the wrath of man does not accomplish the
righteousness of God. 21. Wherefore lay aside all filthynes and superfluity of
maliciousnes, and receyv with meeknes the word which is grafted ^^por^, which
is able to save your souls.

Two faults there be that are vvo^nt to make good counsel and advise fruitles
and unprofitable: to high a concey of ourselves, and to base a conceyt of them
that give us advise. Of yourself I beseech you judge thus: you are but a private
member in Gods Church, you are also a woman: and therefore it is no disgrace
to you, if your knowledge be imperfect and your judgment vveak, especially in
such controversyes as these that are betwixt us.

And as for them that have turned you out of the way wherein once you
vval^^ed with us, and unto whose guydance you stll gladly commit your self,
examine (I be^ech you) not who they be, but what they say: Iam. 2. 1.
Have not the faith of our glori^s Lord Jesus Christ in respeckt of persons.
Iam. 2. Let not their zeal and detestation of all corruptions that are amongst
us, not their vvillingnes to endure trouble fortheyr conscience deceyv you:
considering that not the example of any godly man, but the written word of God
only is to be the rule of one life and religion.

Of me if you can not esteem as of a Minister of Christ, yet let me entreat you
to conceyv thus of me: If in these matters I err, I err of ignorance, I err
neither of malice, nor of covetousnes, not of fear of trouble. Glad would I
be to learn of you, or of any much inferior to you, that could make known my
error unto me, and direct me into a better way. That which I shall set down
in answer to the vvriting you gave me, proceeds not from an hear^ desirous
to deceyve you, or to darken and obscure the known truth, or to plead for any
known corruption in my self or others. For alas what should I gain by
seducing or deceyving you, or what should move me to put out the light^ that
shines in mine own conscience? but as of syncerity, but as of God, in the
sight of God; so write I of these things. And as I have made manifest (...)
affection herein unto God, so do I heartily desire that I may make it manifest
unto your conscience, Wherefore lay apart pride and all high conceit of your
own knowledge: lay apart wrath and malice which you have conceyved either
against our whole Church or against men of my calling, or against myself in
particular. And seeing nothing shall be brought to persuade you, but the
vvordvvhich is grafted in you, which is able to save your soul: re^ey^ it
with meeknes I beseech you. Consider what I say, and the Lord give you
understanding in all things. 2. Tim. 2. 7.

Another letter written in answer of the former, and directed to the same party
that it was. SECTION. 1.
Grace and peace be with you in Jesus Christ I have received and read the
letter, sent unto you by Mr. H. (as I understand:) which you and others entreat
me to answer. Very unwilling I am hereunto in diverse respects: And were it not
for the truths sake (which is called into question) I should not by any means
be drawn to write against any, least off all against him who I understood
wrote this letter unto you. For howsoever in these controversies of religion we
do in judgment or practice differ one from another, yet for the knowledge I have
of him, and the good gifts God has given him, I do and shall always love him in
the Lord. Yet notwithstanding seeing by this letter the truth of Christ is
obscured and oppugned, seeing also by this means you and others might be
seduced into error and fall from your own stedfastnes: I durst not in this
case be wanting either to the defense off Christ's truth, or to the strengthening
off you and others thereyn, to the uttermost off my power: Specially
understanding that diverse copyes of this letter are spread abroad to the hurt
of many: and being also earnestly requested to answer it, not by you only,
but by diverse others whom in this case I could not well deny. Besides that mine
own present estate does not a little urge me hereunto for the clearing of my
self, who for this truth have now a long time suffered trouble, as an evil
doer, even unto bonds: But the word of God is not bound. For these causes have
I ben drawn to answer this writing: hoping that the truth will manifest and
approve it self in the conscience of every godly one. And of Mr. H. who wrote
this letter, I have this hope more specially, for the good things I know to be
in him: howsoever he have been overtaken thus to write against the truth, as my
self also hertofore in ignorance have been an adversary unto it. But God had
mercy on me: as I trust he will also on him and many other yet otherwise
minded. To God the Father of mercyes be praise for ever.

In this hope I will nou proceed by the help of God to make answer to this
letter: And first to the entrance of it, then to the rest thereof. Concernig
the entrance of it, these few things only will I note. First that if Mr. H.
had duly considered and compared with their estate the Iam. 1. 19. 20. 21.
words off the Apostle here alleged by him self together with the Vo^. 22.
next immediately following in this place (where it is further said, And be ye
doers of the word, and not heates only deceyving your own selves): He would I
hope neither have condemned the innocent, even you for your obedience of Christ
and his word, neither have suffered his pen by misalledging the Scripture thus
to labor your with drawing from the obedience of faith. But he would rather
have seen and acknowledged that in their Church estate compared with the
ordinance of Christ they neither are doers of the word, but deceyvers of
themselves: neither do themselves lay aside the filthynes and superfluity of
malice, with meeknes to receyve the word which is able to save their souls:
but are in deed become the enemies and persecuters of the truth, and that in
great wrath and subtilty: howsoever in word they profess otherwise, as do even
the greatest papists. Wherein would to God they were not also over^aryed with
to high a conceit of themselves, and to base a conceit of others who advise
them better.

Secondly for yourself, well may you think, as we all ought, that it is no
disgrace unto us, that our knowledge is imperfect, and our judgment weak: seeing
the Apostle says even off himself as of all others, 1. Cor. 1^. 9. 12.
now we know but in part, and now we see through a glass darkely. Yet also
would I desire Mr. H. remember, and you to note it for your comfort, that God
so disposes for his glory, as even 2. Ioh. ver. 4. and 7.
the private members of the true Church, yea women, are found walking in the
truth, as we have receyved a commandment from the Father, when many deceyvers
(though men, and in public office) are abroad in the world and false Church,
which confess not (in truth and in deed) Jesus Christ come in the flesh, that
only Prophett, Priest, and king, whom God has given to his Church forever.

Thirdly, towching them whom God used as his instruments to draw you out off
the bypa^^s of these assemblyes into the way of truth wherein you now walk: as
you have just cause to bless God for them, so I pray you also regard not so
much who they be, as what they say. And in any case take heed that you Iam. 2.
^2.
never have the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ in respect of persons:
neither of Princes, nor prelates, nor any other though otherwise learned, rich,
or famous, any manner way. Neither let the heat of the adversaryes persecution,
nor the coldness of the time servers swallowing up all the abominations yet
abiding among them, nor the love of this present world, nor the colorable
persuasion of any though never so dare unto you, neither any other thing
whatsoever, ensnare you to be wrapped in like error with them: but remember
always (as is here well noted unto you) that the written word of God only is to
be the rule of our Life and Religion.

Lastly, concerning Mr. H. who wrote this letter unto you, as you shall do well
to take it that he erreth of ignorance and not of malice, etc. as he desires
to be taken: so of him I would desire, for the taking away of this veil from
his eyes, that he do heedfully look into the perfitt law of liberty: not only
the better to see the filthynes of their corruptions that he may avoid them,
but to behold also what orders and offices Christ Jesus has set in his
Church, to keep and observe them. To which end he shall do well himself to
Consider that which here he has set down unto you, concerning the written
word of God. According to which if he shall examine the particulars of their
Church-constitution (of which more, God willing, hereafter): I hope he will no
more say in this case, that as of syncerity, as of God, in the sight of God, so
writes he of these things: but will rather acknowledge that whosoever go about
to bring color out of the Scriptures for them, they do therein no other but 2.
Cor. 2. 17.
make merchandise of the word of God: And therefore will either stay his tal^^,
and lay his hand on his mouth: or if he speak, will speak to his own soul, and
Judge. 6. 31.
say, Will thou plead Antichrists cause* or will thou save him? If he be of
Christ, let him plead for himself, against them that by the word of their
testimony destroy his ordinances. Thus much to the entrance of this letter.

The rest of it is spent in laboring to disprove the writing which it seems
you gave him in defense of your separation from the ministry of these
assemblyes. Which after he has well propounded in form of reasoning, he then
brings some show of answer thereunto and of defense of their Ministry.
Wherein although I might in few lines shortly have noted the subtilty and
unsoundness of his answers yet have I chosen rather to write somewhat largely,
both for your sake and his own, and for others also into whose hands these
writings may co^^. And this have I thought to be the more needful, because he
does here so earnestly both protest the syncerity of his affection, and make
promise that nothing shall be brought to persuade you, but the word of God. Now
of the syncerity of his affection I make no doubt, but do vertly thinck that he
writes and walks as he is persuaded. Only where he promises and pretends
to bring the word of God for the persuasion of your soul, and performs it
not in deed: and yet has such objections and pretense off Scripture and
reason, as greater in this case (I thinck) neither have been neither can well be
brought: therefor have I thought it best, for better clearing of the truth, to
prosecute his annswers from point to poyut: And although it will be the more
tedious, yet to take this course therein: first, to set down in his own words
his aunswers to the reason you gave him: and then to examine and take them away
by the light of the Scriptures. For your self, it shall be your part (as he
desires you) to lay apart all sinister affection, and with meeknes to receyv
the word of truth grafted in you, and able to save your soul. Consider
therefore well what is said: and the Lord give you understanding in all things.
Now to proceed, it follows in his letter to you, thus.

Mr. H. his letter. Section. 2.
The sum of the whole vvriting you gave me is a reason to prove the
lavvfulnes of your separation from our assemblyes, because we have no such
minissters as you may lavvfully join vvhithall: and for plainenes, it may
fitly be concluded in this form: Whosoever he be that deals with the holy
things of God, The Reason alleged for separation from the Church ministry of
England.
and works upon the Consciences of men, by virtue of an Antichristian power
office and calling, him the people of God ought not to receyv or join
themselves unto: 2 These. 2. 4 -- 10.

But all the ministers that stand over the Church assemblyes in England, deal
with the holy things of God, and work upon men's consciences by virtue of an
Antichristian power office and calling.

Therefore the people of God ought not to receyv them, or join themselves unto
them.



The first part of this reason as I am not unwilling to yield unto, so do I
affirm that the words of the Apostle written 2. These. 2. 4. -- 10. are for
the proof thereof vv^ested and perverted from the right sense. For the Apostle
there describes Antichrist, nor by his unlawful on^vvard calling or office
that he should exercise in the Church, but first by the false doctrine he
should teach, as appears plainly by the 10 and 11 verses: and secondly by
the authority he should usurp to give laws unto men's consciences, and to
rule in the hearts of men as God, as you may see in the 4. verse. Which two
ma^ks of Antichrist as they may evidently be discerned in the papacy, so admit
all the outvvard calling and offices in the Church of England exercised, were
faulty and vnvvarrantable by the word* yet you in, your own Conscience know
that these marks of Antichrist can not be found amongst the vvorst of our
ministers. For neither do the laws of our Church allow any to teach false
doctrine, and we all profess Christ to be the only law giver to the
conscience, neither is any thing amongst us urged to be done upon pain of
damnation, but only the word and law of God.

Answer to the 2. Section.
Master H. says here, he is not unwilling to yield to the first part of the
reason: Yet afterward in his letter when he has taken some exception against
the prooff off it, contradicting himselff, he In sectio^ 5. in the end of it.
has these words, And this I hope may be sufficient to show how untrue that is
which is affirmed in the first part of the reason, etc. Now to yield to the
first part of the reason (as being true) and to hold that which is affirmed in
it to be untrue, what are these but contradictary the one to the other? But to
let this pass, because it may be I mistake his meaning, or he forgott
himselff: I com to show that the words off the Apostle written 2. These. 2. 4.
etc. do fitly and directly prove the first part off the reason, and therefore
are not for the proof thereof wrested and perverted from the right sense, as he
takes exception. I prove it thus first.

If this 2. These. 2. 4. etc.
Scripture teach that such as receyv or join unto Antichrist that man of sin
in his apostasy, opposition, and exaltation above all that is called God and
that is holy, that such (I say) shall perish because they receyv not the love
off the truth, but are carried with a strong delusion to beleev lies and to
please themselves in that transgression of the laws and ordinances off God:
then it proves that the people off God may not receyv or join unto any which
deal with the holy things off God and work upon men's consciences by virtue off
any off that Antichrists power, offices, and callings: because in so doing they
cannot but have fellowship in that apostasy, opposition, and exaltation off
Antichrist, and thereby stand subject to perish eternally, forasmuch as they
receyv not the love off the truth, but in a strong delusion please themselves
in untruth and unrighteousness, even in Antichrists tra^sgression off the laws
and ordinances off Jesus Christ.

But the former is true: as may appear by comparing together verse. 3. 4. 7. 8.
with verse. 10. 11. 12. Therefore also the latter.

Next for proof hereoff, let us mark how the Apostle describes Antichrist in
this Scripture. Which we find to be by many mo effects and propertyes then Mr.
H. has noted: and such also, as do plainly show that this Scripture proves
the truth of the first part of the reason for which it is alleged:

1. As first, that Antichrist shall make 2. These. 2. 3.
Apostasy and departure from the faith and order off Jesus Christ prescribed to
his Church. Which whether he have not done it in the offices of ministry, in
the entrance into them, in the works and maintenance off them, as well as in
other points off the faith and commandments of Christ, let the things
themselves speak.

2. Secondly, that he shall be Verse. 3.
a man of sin. Where it is to be observed, that as the true Church of Christ
is compared to the body of a man, and together with Christ the head thereof, is
called by the name of Christ (1. Cor 12. 12.) so the false Church of Antechrist
is compared also to the body of a man, and consisting of all the parts together
is called a man of sin: even wholly given and carried to sin and
transgression of the law of God. Which as in other parts it is to be seen, so
also in the offices and functions of that body of Antechrist that man of sin.

3. Thirdly, that he shall Ver. 3. and 7.
first work as it were in secrett, ^n a mystery, by little and little
gaynesaying and corrupting the ^aith and ordinances of Jesus Christ.

4. Fourthly, that Ver. 4. compared with Ver. 3. 6. 7. 8.
afterward, when that which hinders ^s taken away, he shall then be manifested
and at length exalted ^n his throne, being in his ministry, worship, laws and
co^^titutions opposed against and lifted up above the Lord Jesus, and his true
faith, servants, ministry, ordinances, and all holy things he has given to
his Church.

5. Fifthly, that he shall Ver. 4. cempared with Rev. 1^. 11.
thus be exalted, not without ^he Church among the heathen or Jewish infidels,
but in the ^osome of the Church among them that profess Christ: so as he shall
sit in the Temple of God, prete^ding that he is as God, giving ^les and laws
to the consciences of me^ for the service of God.

6. Sixthly, that he shall be Ver. 8. anomos, that is, sav^les, or, lavvbreakes.
A lawles man, who will not (...) tied to the laws and ordinances off Jesus
Christ, but will ^spise and opyugne them, and set up others off his own at ^s
pleasure.

7. Seventhly, that Ver. 9. compared with Mat. 24. 24.
Satan shall set all his power and cunning as to erect and establish, so also
to uphold this throne and kingdom of Antichrist: And that with such power and
lying wonders, as (if it were possible) the very elect should be deceyved.

8. Moreover, that notwithstanding all the power of Satan, au^d the Apostasy,
subtil^y, opposition, exaltation, and iniquity of the man of sin, yet at
length Ver. 3. and 8. compard with Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8.
he shall with all his offices and constitutions be utterly consumed by the
spirit and power of Christ Jesus, appearing in the brightness of his Gospel,
before the last day. Whereupon also he is here called the son of perdition,
being by God foreappoynted to be destroyed and abolished.

9. Finally, that ver. 10. 11. 12. compared with Rev. 14. 9. 10 11.
they which partake in his apostasy and iniquity, shall justly perish: because
they receyv not the love of the truth to obey Jesus Christ, that they might be
saved: but being strongly deluded, beleev and please themselves in the lies and
unrighteousness of Antichrist unto condemnation.

By all which it appears both how vnperfitly Mr. H. has noted down the marks
of Antichrist described in this place, and that Antichrist is here described to
have unlawful calling^ and offices. For otherwise how should he stand 2. These.
2. 3.
in apostasy from the true callings and offices, as well as from the other
ordinances appointed by Jesus Christ? how else should he stand so directly in
Ver. 4.
opposition against, and so proudly in exaltation above all that is called God,
and that is holy? Ver. 8.
how should he else be said to be lavvles, contemning and treading under foot
the laws and commandments of Jesus Christ? Yea; how should he else deceyv the
world so as he does in ver. 10. 11
all deceyveablenes of unrighteousness, if he had not unlawful callings and
offices, wherein to teach and reign over the people ^educed by him: which yet
they beleving lies should count to be lawful, as they do even unto this day?

But to let other reasons alone, and to take the marks of Antichrist, which Mr.
H. has himself here set down. I would ask, first how Antichrist shall teach
his false doctrine (which here Mr. H. notes to be one mark): whether in the
lawful offices and callings ordained by Christ, or in the unlawful offices
and callings devised by Satan and used by this man of sin in his Apostasy?
Secondly, how he shall usurp that authority, to give laws unto men's
consciences, and to rule in the hearts of men as God (which Mr. H. notes as
the^ other mark): whether in the true offices and callings appointed by
Christ, or in false ones devised by Satan and himself? For the very terms and
actions of teaching and of usurping authority, here mentioned by Mr. H. do in
this case imply some offices and callings, lawful or unlawful, wherein to
teach and usurp authority. Now lawful they can not be, because he stands in
apostasy from Christ's way, yea oppositt against it, and even lawles in that
respect. It remains therefore that they are unlawful ones. And being found
not one lyin the papacy, but in the Church of England: it follows that they
are not to be receyved or joined unto in the one any more then in the other: as
also that this Scripture is not wres^ed, but fitly and foundly alleged for the
proof of the first part of the reason.

But because Mr. H. takes exception at the proof, though all in vain: yet for
his better satisfaction, and more strenghtning of the proposition, let him
further consider, first, that as Christ being king and Lord of his Church, has
given unto it the holy things of his word, Sacraments, Censures, Treasury etc.
so he has also as 1. Co^. 12. 5. 28. Ephesians. 4. 8. 11. 12. Romans 12. 7. 8.
with. 1. Tim. 3. cap. and 5. cap. and 6. 13. 14. 15.
Lord and king appointed offices of his own to conti^^e to the end of the
world, to wit, Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons and Helpers, for the due
administration of these his holy things according to his word, being lawfully
called thereunto. So as neither any may meddle therewith by virtue of any
Antichristian power office or calling, nor if they do, may any join with them
therein, least partaking in their sins, they receyv also of their plagues.
Secondly, that 1. Co^. 3. 16. 17. and 2. Cor. 6 16. 17. 18. compared with 2.
These 2. 4. 10.
our consciences are the Temples of the holy Ghost. Wherrvpon it must needs
follow, that we may not suffer Antichrist to fit in them at all: as he does
whenever we suffer them to be wrought upon in the ministry of the word or
any other ways, by virtue of any Antichristian power office or calling. And
this I thought to annexe for the further confirmation of the first part of the
reason: which though in word Mr. H. seems to grant, yet in deed he laboreth
to oppugn.

Now where he says, the laws of their Church allow not any to teach false
Doctrine: although this be not much material towching the point in
controversy, seeing they allow not any to teach true doctrine but in false and
Antichristian callings, which is utterly unlawful to be done: yet we find that
by the laws of their Church many false doctrines are and may be tauht amoug
them. A taste of which leaven of theyrs* I will give in some particulars, as
follows.

1 That there may be in the Church other Archbishops and Lordbischops, then
Jesus Christ, which is contrary to 1 Pet. 5. 3. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 5. Eephes. 4. 5.
Heb. 3. 1. etc. Luke 22. 25. 26. 2 That men may and ^ught to be made ministers
by these Lord Bishops (that is, may enter into the ministry by another way,
then Christ has set down in his word, and by other Lord bishops then Jesus

Ier. 23. 21. Act. 14. 23. with 6. 3. 5. 3 That the Prelates and their

ministers of the Church may be civil magistrates also and exercise civil
authority in the common wealth. Which is contrary to Mat. 20. 25 26. 2 Timothy 2.
4. Romans 13. 1. etc. Rev. 17. 18. 5 That me^ may give the titles of the lord

20. Mat. 23. 8. 9. 10. Job. 32. 21. 22. 2 These. 2. 4. 6 That the Lord Bishops
can give the holy Ghost, and power to retain and forgive sins* As when they
make any Ministers, they say unto them, Receyv the holy Ghost: whose sins
thou do forgive, they are forgiven and whose sins thou do retain they
are retained. Which is contrary to Luk 11. 13. Ioh. 3. 8. and 15. 26. 27. and

These and diverse other false doctrines do the laws of their Church allow to
be taught. And if any among them teach otherwise, they are subject to be
suspended, excommunicated, degraded, deprived by their Lords the Prelates,
their Chauncelours, and Officials. And we, because we teach and walk otherwise,
are haled to prisons and gallows, banished and rayled upon, yea hated of all
men for the truths sake.

Now as you see the laws of their Church allow false doctrine to be taught: so
for their preaching also of the truth, consider I pray you what themselves have
heretofore written of themselves. In an Second admon. to the Parliam. page 6
and 7.
admonition to the Parliament, they say and write of their Church estate, as
follows. We are (say they) so scarce com to the outward face of a Church
rightly reformed, that although some truth be taught by some preachers, yet no
preacher may without great danger of the laws utter all the truth comprised
in the book of God. It is so circumscribed and wrapped within the compass of
such articles, such penaltyes, such Injunctious, such advertissements, such
articles, such canons, such sober caveats, and such manifold pamphlets, that in
manner it does but peep out from behind the skreen. The laws of the land, the
book of common prayer, the Queens Injunctious the Commissioners
advertissements, the Bishops canons, Li^woods provincials, every Bishops
articles in his dioces, my Lord of Canterburyes sober caveats, his licenses to
preachers, and his high court of prerogative or grave fatherly faculties: these
together or the worst of them (as some of them be to bad) may not be broken or
offended against, but with more danger then to offend against the Bible. To
these subscribing, and subscribing again, and the third subscribing are
required: for these preachers and others are indicted, are fined, are prisoned,
are excommunicated, are banished, and have worse things threatened them. And the
Bible, that must have no further scope, then by these it is assigned. Is this
to profess Gods word? Is this a reformation? He that could not abide Lev. ^0.
1. 2.
strange fire in the old law, but burnt them that used it: what will he do to
us in the new law, that erect a new and strange course or word, to rule
his Church by: What did the Pope but so? He did suffer Gods word to have a
course, as far as it pleased him, so that he might have the whole authority
above it. So did the popish Church. But we say Ephesians. 2. 20.
the word is above the Church. Then suerly it is about the English Church, and
above all these books before rehearsed. If it be so, why are not they
ouer-ruled by it, and not it by them?

These are their own words: and that in an admonition to the high court of
parliament. So as (we holding our peace) you may by this perceive in what
estate they stand by the laws and present constitution of their Church.

But Mr. H. adds moreover, that they all profess Christ to be the only law
giver unto the conscience. Is this so in deed? How is it then, that Matthew
Sutcliffe Deane of Exce^er a chief officer in their Church is not afraid nor
ashamed to publish in print, that it Sutclifs. English treatise of eccles
discipline. page 7.
sounds harsh in Christian ea^es, to call Christ a Lavvgiuer? But to let him
alone with his blasphemous contradiction to the Esa. 33. 22. and 42 4. Genesis 49.
10. Act. 5. 31. Gal. 6. 2 Ier. 31. 33. with Heb. 8. 10. Iam. 4. 12.
Scriptures and Spirit of God: let us consider a little the prof^ssion they make
herein. And first, I ask, what if the Papists profess as much? Will such Tit.
1. 16.
profession in word help any thing, when in deed by their works they deny it?
Secondly, let Mr H. remember, that Dem^stra*in the preface to the Reader also,
Declar, of eccses, discip.
some of themselves affirm, vvhiles they profess Christ to be a king, and per
submitt not to the laws he has prescribed in his word, they make him an
Idol, and putt a scepter of reed in his hand. Thirdly, do not they find fault
with the Papists, and prove them to bend true Church though they profess in
word that Christ is the king of his Church, becouse in deed they obey not his
laws, but have invented and use their own canons and constitutions for
government of the Church? Mark well their own words in Gods arrow against A
therists, Papists, etc. cap. 5.
a treatise lately published, wherein they prove the Church of ^ome not to be
the true Church, by this reason following: The Papists in word will not deny,
but Christ is a king, which has all power in heaven and in earth: But in
deed it appears they do exile and banish him out of his kingdom, or at least
leav him but a small portion or rather none at all. For in respect that he is a
spiritual king and the king of his Church, he is also (as James I am. 4. 12.
speaks) the only lavvgi^er thereunto: and therefore by his laws only the
Church is to be governed: Which they cannot abide. For they add their popish
Canous, constitutions, and customs, whereby they will have, the Church
governed: Yea, they will have these take place, though they utterly displace
the word of God for the maintenance of them. These are their own words in that
treatise. Thus they reason against the Papists. And is not this reason (I pray
you) as strong against themselves, and against their own Church, Prelates and
Clergy? Yea, are not their ecclesiastical assemblyes Ezech. 16. 44. with Rev.
17. 5.
daughters of the Church of ^ome in this behalf? Or have the^ more privilege
by their verbal profession, to be ex^mpt from the obedience of Christ and his
laws, then the Papists have? Lastly, seeing Mr H. says they profess Christ to
be the only lawgiver to the conscience: Let him in syncerity of heart, as
before God, answer us these few questions: 1 Whether then obedience be not to
be given to the Lord Jesus in whatsoever he has commanded, and all his laws
and ordinances to be observed, though all the Princes on earth should forbid
it. 2 Why then they abstain from the observation of those Laws and ordinances
which T. C. first reply page 177. Declar. of ^ccles. disipline, etc.
themselves have taught and written to be appointed by Jesus Christ, to be kept
unblameable and without spott until his appearing, yea, though it be with the
loss of wealth, honor, liberty, and life it self. 3 Whether the Lord Jesus
the lawgiver of his Church have not set in his Church to continue to the end of
the world, the offices of Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons and Helpers:
together with their entrance, works, and maintenance: for the administration of
his holy things. 4 Whether the Offices of Archbishops, Lord bisshops, priests,
deacons, vicars, and the rest now had in England, their manner of entrance into
them, their administration of them by their popish canons and book of common
prayer, their maintenance in them by tithes Lordships, Chrismes, offerings and
such like, be appointed by Christ that only Lawgiver to his Church: and in
what places of his Testament. 5 Whether being not prescribed by Christ, but
derived from and belonging to Antichrist, any can either administer or join
unto them in that estate: and yet in truth acknowledge Christ to be the only
lawgiver to the conscience. 6 Finally, whether they which abide one with the
world and false Church, not separating themselves from them according to the
Act. 2. 40. and 19. 9. 2 Cor. 6. 17. 18. Rev. 18. 4. 1. Tim. 6. 3. 4. 5.
commandment of Christ: which administer or receyv the word or Sacraments in
or from a false ministry: which how down unto traditions and false worship
devised and imposed by man: which stand subject to be silenced and
excommunicated by the Prelates, their Chauncelours and Archdeacons: whether
these (I say) can be said in truth to hold Christ to be the only lawgiver to
the conscience? Or whether they receyv not the mark of the Beast, and as yet
stand subjects of his kingdom, submitting to his Antichristian laws and
constitutions.


In the last place Mr. H. adds, that nothing among them is urged to be done
upon pain of damnation, but only the word and law of God. To which I answer,
first, that if this were true, yet it is not to the purpose seeing many things
among them contrary to the word of God are urged to be done upon pain of
imprisonment, confiscation of Goods and lands, banishment, death, and such
like. Secondly, I answer that they do require men to be subject to their
excommunication upon pain of damnation, as Ad salutem animae that is, to the
salvation of the so^le.
their own words in their writs of excommunication do show. Now it is evident
and confessed by the best of themselves, that they have not Christ's power to
excommunicate, but execute it contrary to the word of God, by an Archdeacon or
Lordly Prelate, according to their canons, Whereupon also (to note it by the
way) it follows, that they are not a true Church of Christ. For 1 Cor. 5. 4.
6. Mat. 18. 17. 18. 19. 20. And this Mr H. grants aftervvardrin section. 5.
Christ's Church has always Christ's power to excommunicate: Whereas these
assenblyes have no other power to excommunicate, but by the Archdeacon or
Lordbischop, whose offices be Antichristian. And hereupon it is, that the more
religious any is among them, the more he contemns their excommunication:
Which were a fearful sin, if their Church were a true Church, whose bynding
on earth were such as bound also in heaven. Thirdly, I answer, if their
ministry and worship of God were according to the word and law of God, then
ought all upon pain of damnation to submit and join unto it. Now if they do
not so urge it, themselves do thereby acknowledge, that it is not of God. If
they do so ^rgeit, then they urge upon pain of damnation that which is
contrary to the word and law of God: as has been and shall more be showed
hereafter. Now it follows in his letter, thus.

Mr. H. his letter. Section. 3.
TO which purpose also I beseech you to consider, that althoug there is not the
least part of Christ's ordinances that can be neglected without grievous sin
yet the want or neglect of some of these ordinances of Christ, which concern
the discipline of his Church and the outvvard calling of the ministers, is no
such sin, as can make either the ministers, and governors of our Church
Antichrists, or our Church an Antichristian and false Church. And although
diverse corruptions remain in our Church, which were derived to us from the
Papi^es (the least whereof I will not take upon me to defendt, yet are they
not of that nature that can make us an Antichristian Church.

For first, no one place of Scripture can be found, wherein he is called a^
Antichrist or Antichristian, who holding the truth of doctrine, and professing
those articles of religion that are fundame^tall as you know we do) does
(...) either in judgment or practice from that rule that Christ has given for
the Discipline of his Church. In the prophecy of Daniel, Antichrist is
described by his Doctrine, Dan. 7. 8. 25.

So is he in the epistle to the Thessalonians, 2 These. 2. 10. 11.

And in the epistle to Timothy, 1 Timothy 4. 1. 2. 3.

And in the Epistles of John, 1 Ioh. 2. 22. and 4. 3. and 2* Ioh. 7.

And in the book of Revelation: chap 13. 5. 6.

Neither can you find any Antichrist mentioned in the Scripture, whose
doctrine was sound* Our Savior Christ calls him a true Pastor, and no
hi^^ling who leads the sheep in at the door, Ioh. 10. 2. that is, who
teaches no other means of salvation, but Christ only, who is the door of
the sheep, Ioh. 10. 7. 9.

He affirms also that whosoever beleveth in his heart, and confesses with
his mouth, that he is that Christ and Messiah promised, is a true member of his
Church and built upon a rock, against which the gates of hell shall not
prevail. If then the doctrine of our Church be sound, what vvarrant have you
to call^s Antichrists? If our pastors offer to lead you unto salvation through
no other door then Christ, hovy dare you that say you are Christ's, refuse to
be guyded by them? If our asse^blyes be built upon that rock, hov^ can you deny
them to be true Churches?

Answer to Section, 3.
IT is to be noted here, first that Mr. H. denies not but they stand in
grievous sin, by neglecting Christ's ordinances: secondly, that he grants
they retain diverse corruptions in their Church, which were derived to them
from the Papists. How their case standing thus by his own confession, how can
he peswade you or any other to Rev. 18. 4. and 14. 9. 20.
partake with them in such sins, unless he would have you also to receiv of
their plagnes.

Again it is to be observed, that ^r. H. faith here, he will not take upon him
to defend the least of their popish corruptions: And yet does clean otherwise
throughout this letter, chiefly in his answer to the second part of the
reason. But to omit this, I would desire to have noted down in particular, the
corruptions remaining in their Church, which he confesses were derived to them
from the Papists. And then, let it be judged whether they be Antichristian.

Here also it is to be minded, that the ministry and constitution of their
Church is not charged to be Antichristian, because of this, that they want or
neglect some of Christ's ordinances (as here he may seem to insinuate) but
because they have and submitt unto Antichrists: as will appear in the
discussing of them. In the mean time (to omit many other) let him consider,
first, that their forcing and confounding in the body of their Church all manner
people though never so wicked, to stand members thereof, is merely Rev. 13. 16.
and 18 2
Antichristian, and directly contrary to the order of Jesus Christ, who has
commanded his people to Ad. 2. 40 41. Rev. 18. 4. 2. Cor. 6. 1^. E^ra. 6. 21.
and 9. 14. Psalm. 119. 113 128.
separate willingly from the world and all false ways. Secondly that the
offices of 2. These. 2. 4. Rev. 9. 3. with 1. Cor. 12 5. Ephe. 4. 5. 11 1. Pet.
5. 3. 4.
Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons and their Officials (in whom rests the
chief ecclesiastical power among them) are also Antichristian, and were never
set by Christ in his Church. Thirdly, that the offices, of the Rev. 18. 11.
and 17. 1. etc. and 9. 3. compared with Heb. 7 12. Romans 12. 7. 8 Ephesians. 4. 11.
12. 1. Tim. 5. 17.
Priests, Deacons, Dicars, s^ipendaryes, and the rest of the inferior
ministry among them, their entrance also into their offices, their
administration of them, and maintenance in them, are not found in the Testament
of Christ nor in the Primitive Churches planted by the Apostles, but derived
from and belonging to the aposta^y of Antichrist, and found in his popish
pontifi^all and assemblyes even unto this day.

Next towching their profession he speaks of, I answer: first, that the
verbal profession of the articles of religion that are fundamental, will no
more help them then it does the Papists: who do also verbally and daily repeat
and profess in general the articles of faith, called the Apostles treed, and
the Creed of Athanasius, of Nice, and Calcedon: wherein are briefly and
generally contained the fudamentall points of Christian religion. But what
avayleth this either the one or the other, when otherwise in particular, all of
them in practice, and some in judgment deny Christ to be that eternal Prophet,
Priest, and king of his Church, howsoever in word and general they both do
profess it.

Secondly I answer, that the very strength of delusion, and depth of the
subtilty of Antichrist (by which he deceyveth) stands in this, that he
pretends to be for and with Christ, and teaches many excele^t truths*
otherwise he would soon be espied and forsaken: whereas now it is a mystery
(as the Scripture 2. These. 2. 7. Rev. 17. 5.
says) hardly discerned, and hardlyer avoided. Hereupon it is that among the
Papists, so many of them are deluded, whi^^^ the Pope professes he is not
against Christ, but for him, even his vica^, and Peter's successor: that his
Church is the Catholic Church, out of which there is no salvation, and such
like. And among these in England likewise, whiles their ministers pretend to be
the ministers of Christ, and profess to bring his Gospel with them: when as
in deed they revile and persecute the true and sy^cexe practice of it even unto
death.

Thirdly I ask, whether the ministry worship and government appointed by
Christ for his Church under the gospel, be not as much of the foundation, as
the ministry, worship, and government appointed by Moses for the time of the
law? And if they be, whether they are not as faithfully set down by Christ as
the other were by Moses, and as carefully to be observed by us, as the other
were by the Jews: or rather much more, in as much as Heb. 3 1 2. 3.
Christ the Son is wor^^^y of more glory and honor, then Moses the servant.

Fourthly I ask, what fundamental articles of religion Moses and Aar on with
the rest of the Jews joining with them held, that Number. 16. 1. 2. 3. etc.
Corah, Dathan, Abiram^ and their company held not: differing only from them
concerning the office of Priesthood and Ministry thereof, a matter of the
Discipline, as these men^call it. Yet were they with all that departed not from
their tents destroyed by the just judgment of God. The like may be seen in
other points of the Discipline of the Church, in the examples of Le^. 10. 1 2.
Nadab and Abihu, of 2 King. 16. 10. etc.
^zziah the priest, and of 2 Chronicles, 26. 18. 19.
^zziah the king. Which examples of all sorts are written for our learning,
that people of all estates might know and remember, that 1 Samuel 15 22. 23.
to obey the temmaundements of God in whatsoever thing he has enjoined, is
better then sacrifice, and to hear^en better then the fa^^ of rams; whereas
disobedience and rebellion against the, commandments of God is as the sin
of witchcraft, under what pretense soever it be, and transgression is wickedness
and Idolatry, how lightly soever men account thereof.

Fifthly whereas Mr H. says there is no Antichrist whose Doctrine is sound: I
willingly grant it, and have already showed their case to be such. Yet with
all I wish Mr H. to mark, that even Antichrist that man of ^inne professes
many notable truths and foundamentall articles of religion, as that there is a
God, one in essence, three in persons, the Father, Son, and holy Ghost: that
Christ is God and Man, Prophet, Priest, and king of his Church: that the holy
Ghost is present with the Church of Christ to the end of the world: that there
shall be a resurectio^ of just and unjust, etc. And yet notwithstanding
stands he with all his followers in defection from the truth and obedience of
Christ, even to destruction. By all which is manifest, that the verbal
profession helps little, when men in practice and particulars deny that, which
inword in general they (...) to hold, and thereby de^^ive the world, as if
they held the truth, when indeed they fight against it.

Finally therefore on the one hand understanding by the Discipline of the
Church (as we ought) the ancient and holy order and ordinances, which Christ
Jesus by his last Testament has given to his Church, for the administration of
his holy things, and for the keeping of his people in the obedience of faith:
and considering on the other hand, that 2 The^ 2. 3. 4. Rev. 17. 4. 5.
Antichrist has perverted that holy order, and made apostasy from those holy
laws, advauncing himself and his own constitutions above them, and that also
in the ministry, worship and government of the Church, as well as in other
parts thereof: it does and must needs follow hereupon, that whosoever do not
only not keep that holy order and appointement of Christ, but also bow down to
the confusion and false Ministry of Antichrist, they stand in Antichrian
estate, notwithstanding any truths they teach, profess, or mainteyne. So as
then the Ministry of the Church of England being never ordained by Christ, but
derived from Antichrist that man of (...), it helps them not in this behalf,
that they teach and receiv much truth therein: as we see it helps not the
papists, that their priests teach, there is a God, a Christ an holy Spirit; and
Church, a resurrection, and many other fundamental (...) of Christian
religion, as before has been said.

But now let us come to examine, whether in the Scriptures here alleged by Mr
H. Antichrist be not described to be against Jesus Christ, even in that which
they call the discipline of the Church, as in other things also agreing to them
in their estate. The first Scripture he alleges, is out of the Dan. 7. 8 25.
prophecy of Daniel. The words are these: I considered the horns, and behold,
another home, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns
were plucked away before it. And lo, eyes like the eyes of a man were in that
home, and a mouth speaking presumptuous things,

Dan. 7. 8. And he shall speak words against the most High, and consume the
Saints of the most High, and think to alter the times and law: and they shall be
given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time,

Dan. 7. 25.

Now although this Scripture seem first to be understood of Antiochus Ep^hanes,
and of his pride and tyranny against the truth and people of God: yet may it
also fi^ly be applied further and compared with the description of the beast in
the Rev. 13. Cap. and 9. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.
Revelatio^, and so with the Antichristian prelacy and pri^^^hood from time to
time. For (to omit other things that might here be observed, and to note only
such things as art most evident) we see here that horn of the beast described
to have eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking presumtuous things.
Even so the ministers of Antichrist (who will needs be the eyes of the people
and light of the world) pretend to be the ministers of Christ: and not that
only, but have also (as well as that horn) a mouth speaking presumptuous
things, even against the most High. See it in these particulars following, and
such like which are rise among them: that the true ministry and sincere
practice of the Gospel of Christ, is schism, heresy, fancy, rebellion,
insurrection, sedition, subversion of the State, and what not? that Christ the
Son has been less faithful then Moses the servant, in setting down any
prescript ministry and order for the Church under the Gospel perpetually to
be kept: that Christ who has all power i^ heaven and in ^arth, is not to be
submitted unto in that ministry order and discipline which he has given to
his Church, if Princes on earth forbid or refuse to establish it: that the
ministry of Antichrist is to be receyved and joined unto, being appointed by
Christian Princes for the service of God: that it is lawful for others to be
Archbishops and Lordbishops over the Church and ministers of the Gospel,
besides Jesus Christ: that a priesthood, a stinted number of words and prayers,
tithes, and such like are appointed for the ministry of the Gospel of Christ:
that Christ shall not reign over them by his offices and ordinances prescribed
in his word: that Christ in his soul went down into hell, whiles his body
remained in the grave: whereunto may be added the blasphemous speech of their
prelates to such as they make priests, when they say unto them Receyv the holy
Ghost, as if the holy Ghost were in their power to give to whom and when they
please. Now let all men that have any spark of knowledge or fear of God in
their hearts judge whether these and such like among them be not presumptuous
speeches, even against the most High, and consequently whether this Scripture
be not verifyed of them, that they have a mouth speaking presumptuous things.

But besides their speeches, to come also to their actions noted in this
Scripture: do they not consume the Saints of the most High, in their prisons,
at their gallows, by tossing them up and down, keeping them from their trades,
driving them into banishment, and infinite such calamityes? Do they not think
they may change the times and Law, as Daniel here speaks? Else whence are
come their changing of working days into holy day^s, their fasting da^es also
and forbidding of Marriage in Lent, Advent, and other seasons of the year?
Whence likewise have proceeded their changing and refusing of the Laws of
Christ appointed in his word for the ministry and order of his Church: and the
receyving and practicing of other laws, offices, canons, constitutions,
facultyes, dispensations, and a thousand such like never appointed by God? Thus
we see the testimony of Damel here alleged by Mr H. makes altogether against
themselves, and in a few words effectually describes their most scarefull
estate.

Whereunto upon this occasion we may fitly add other like prophecyes of
Daniel, and apply them also in like manner to this purpose: as for example, Dan.
8. 10. with Rev. 6 13. 14. and 13. 7
their growth and tyranny against the army of heaven, that is, the true Church
and people of God: their casting down to the g^ound some of the army and of the
stars, that is, some of the true Church and ministers thereof: their stamping
upon them in all pride and cruelty: the Dan. 8. 11. ^ith^ 2. These. 2. 4.
exaltation of the preary and other Clergy above the Prince of the army, even
the Lord Jesus Christ and his holy ordinances: their Dan. 11. 31. and 8. 11
(...) Rev. 13. 6. 15.
polluting and casting down of the Sanctuary of strength, even of the true
Church and temple of God: their taking away of the true spiritual worship of
God, sweet in the nos^r^is of God and acceptable to him, as the daily
sacrifice: their setting up of their own abominable in^en^ions, even the
Desolation of Gods true service: and finally their in the Prelacy and other
ministry of this age, notwithstanding that few now dare or will acknowledge it.
Hitherto of the testimony alleged out of the Prophet Daniel: which, as has been showed, is wholly against themselves.

In the 2. These. 2. 10. 11.
epistle to the Thessalo^ans, which is next alleged, the Apostle among other
propertyes and works of Antichrist, describes his coming to be by the vvorking
of Satan, In all deceiveablenes of vn^ighteousnes, among them that perish,
because they receyved not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

And therefore God will send upon them the effectual working of delusion,
that they should beleev^lyes.

2 These. 2. 10. 11.

Of this testimony is spoken In the answer of the second section* Page 6. 7.
8.
before sufficiently. Whereunto now I add only these particulars concerning
this Scripture and their estate to be duly weighed of them. First whether their
Prelacy, ministry, courts and proceedings ecclesiastical be not deceits of
unrighteousness. Secondly, whether their objections, ^avils, and apposition
against the truth be not also of the same nature. Thirdly, whether they receyv
the love of the truth that they might be saved, when as they receyv not that
ministry worship and government of the Church which Christ has appointed
thereunto: who Heb. 5. 9. ^oh. 3. 36 with Matthew. 28. 20. 1. Tim. 6. 13. 14.
is made author of eternal salvation only unto them that obey him. Fourthly,
whether they be not strongly deluded to beleev lies to damnation, when as in
religion they receyv and submitt unto the Prelacy, ministry, worship, and
constitutions of men yea of that beastly man of sin here spoken of: the Rev.
14. 9. 10. 11. Psalm. 119. 21. with Exodus 20. 4. 5. (...)
print of whose ordinances whosoever receives, makes himself subject to
drin^k of the cup of Gods wrath for evermore.

The next place he cites, is out of the 1. Tim. 4. ^. 2. 3.
first epistle to Timothey: The words are these.

Now the Spirit speaks evidently, that in the latter times some shall depart
from the faith, giving heed unto spirits of er^our, and doctrines of devils.

Speaking lies through hyp^crisy and having the consciences burned with an
^^teyron,

Forbidding to marry, commanding to absteyne from mea^s, which God has
created to be receyved with thanks giving, of them which beleev and
acknowledge the truth*

1. Tim. 4. 1. 2. 3. Here we see it was foretold, first that Antichrist should
make departure from the faith. Which bring done by him as well in the ministry
and worship appointed by Christ, as in other points and doctrines of the
Gospel: it can not be avoided, but that the ministry and worship of these
assemblyes being derived from that apostasy, they are also within compass of
this Scripture, notwithstanding they teach and profess many excellent points
of the faith, as do also the Papists themselves not a few.

Secondly, it was foretold, that the followers of Antichrist should give heed
to spirits of error and Doctrines of devils, and speak lies through hypocrisy
having their consciences feared with an hott iron. Which to be verifyed of them
in their constitution and practice, may sufficiently be seen both in their
false doctrines Page 10. 11. 12. 13.
before mentioned to which they give heed, and in that which has been Page 7.
22. 23. 26.
said before concerning Dan. 7. and 2 These. 2. To which I refer you.

Thirdly, it is here foretold, that Antichrist and his followers should forbid
marriage, and meats: towching which, two this only will I say at this time. For
the first, that as it excuses not the Papists from being deciphered in this
Scripture because they suffer marriage to the lay people (as they call them)
when as they forbid it to their priests: so it will but little a veil these,
that they permit it to their ministers, and yet forbid it to fellows of
Colleges in the universityes, and to others mo among them. Besides that they
forbid it to all peole whatsoever in Lent. Rogation week, and such like popish
seasons: And when they do permit it, suffer it only to be solemnized by a
priest, and according to their book: Which is merely popish and never appointed
by God. For the second, that is, the forbidding of meats, let them consider
well with themselves their absteyning from flesch on Saints eves, Ember days,
Fridayes and Saterdayes, more then upon of her days, and in Lent more then
other seasons of the year: let them (I say) consider these things well and see
whether they more agree with the rule of the Apostle here set down, or with the
defection of Antichrist here foretold.

Next he alleges diverse testimonies out of 1 Io^. 2. 22. and 4. 3. and 2
(...). 7.
the epistles of John. The words be these.

Who is a liar, if not he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? this is the
Antichrist, which denies the Father and the Son.

1 Io^. 2. 23. By this shall ye know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that
confesses Jesus Christ come in the flesh, is of God. And every spirit which
confesses not Jesus Christ come in the flesh, is not of God: but this is the
spirit of Antichrist,

1. Ioh 4. 2. 3. Many deceyvers are entered into the world, which confess not
Jesus Christ come in the flesh. He that is such one, is a deceyve^ and an
Antichrist.

2. Ioh. 7. HEre in few words is comprised a most notable direction how to know
Antichrist, and declared also by the contrary in the fourth chapter, as is here
noted down. Where the Apostle teaches us to try and know the spirits of all
men by the confession they make concerning Christ: to wit, by their
acknowledging or derogating from his person, or office. For unto these two
heads he brings the whole matter, the one concerning the person, the other
concerning the office of the Lord Jesus. Towching his person, that he is God
and Man in one and the same person. His Godhead he notes out in these words
[Iesus Christ is come] to wit, the Son of God from heaven: his manhood in
those words [in the flesh]: the uniting and knitting together of these two
natures in one person, when speaking of one and the same Jesus Christ, he
says, he is come in the flesh.

Towching his office, that this Jesus is the CHRIST, that is, the anointed of
God, that should come into the world, to be the only and sufficient Mediator
betwixt God and man. Now as in the time of the law they were wont to annoint
the 1 King* 19. 16.

This have I shortly noted for the better understanding of these Scriptures,
and deciding of the controversy between us and these assemblyes. And this to be
the true meaning of these Scriptures, appears not only by the Argument and
circumstances of the places themselves, but also by the conference of other
Scriptures here quoted in the margent, and infinite such like in the Book of
God. Now before I proceed to any further application of them, let me here again
call to power mind that which has before ben noted, that even the Papists
themselves (whom these men acknowledge to be of Antichrist) affirm in general
words and will die in it against the Jews and Turks, that Jesus Christ is come
in the flesh, the Prophet, Priest, and king of his Church. Yet will not Mr. H.
or any of good knowledge say to the contrary, but the Papists notwithstanding
are by these Scriptures convinced to be of Antichrist, because that although
they profess thus much in general terms, yet when as their estate and
practice is examined by the Scriptures in particular, they are found to
profess that in word which in truth and in deed they do not acknowledge. And
why then may not we so reason from these Scriptures against these assemblyes,
which in their constitution and practice do likewise in deed deny that in
particular, which in general they do profess concerning Christ's prophecy,
priesthood, and Kingdom? Mr. Beza in his notes Beza his notes upon 1 Ioh. 4.
2. 3. and upon 1 Ioh. 2. 22. and 2^ Ioh. 7.
upon these Scriptures, says thus, The Apostle here gives a sure and
perpetual rule to discern Antichrists and Antichristian Doctrine by, to
wit, if the divine or humane nature of Christ or the true vnitiug of them
together be denied, or if never so little be derogated from the office of that
our everlasting high Priest, Prophet, and King. Math this well. Thus does Mr.
Beza understand these Scriptures: and thus he gathers from them: as you may
see in his notes upon the new Testament which are printed in English. And these
Scriptures themselves we see do not point at the Papists alone, as if they
only were culpable herein: but they concern all others whosoever they be that
come within compass of these rules. Now to show in particulars how the Papists
offend in this behalf, denying that in deed concerning Christ, which in word
they do acknowledge, is altogether needles at this time: it being granted on
both parts, I mean, both of us and of them which yet stand in these
assemblyes. It shall be sufficient therefore to show that these assemblyes of
England (as now they stand) do not in this their constitution of Church
ministry, worship, and order receyv and obey* Jesus Christ in his own
ordinance, as their Prophet, Priest, and King: And therefore howsoever in word
generally they profess, yet in truth do not in this their constitution
acknowledge Jesus Christ come in the flesh: And consequently (by the rule and
sentence of the Apostle in these Scriptures) are not of God, but of Antichrist.

First therefore concerning Christ's Prophecey, that they do not receyv and
hearken unto him in his own ordinance as their Prophett, is to lamentably
evident by this, that they do not receyv and submitt unto that ecclesiastical
order, ministry, and government, which Christ Jesus that Prophet of his Church
has revealed from God the Father in his word, and prescribed to his Church to
be kept to the end of the world. This I show two ways: First, by their Church
constitution: then by their own confession.

The present constitution of their Church assemblyes throughout the land is
such, as they stand every one of them subject to the ministry and government
of another Archbishop and Lord bishop then Jesus Christ, of an Archdeacon, and
a parson, vitar, or stipendery, being either priest or deacon, so ma^^ by the
Prelates: also to their devised ^^^ted book worship and administration, to
their ceclesiasticall courts, canons, excommunications, absolutions, and such
other their procedings. Which are not only not found in the Testament of
Christ appointed by that Prophet: but were derived from Antichrist that liar
and deceyver of the world.

Their confession is manifest in their books and writings, wherein they have
published to the view of the world, (...) VVh^^g. defense against T. C. page
658.
there is no certain and perfitt kind of government prescribed in the
Scriptures to the Church of Christ, which must o^ necessity be perpetually
observed. Again, that Ibid. page 389.
the exte^^^ government of the Church under a Christian magistrate must be
according to the kind and form of the government used in the common wealth.
Moreover, that Remo^st. cap. 1. page 11
the Apostles neither (...) vvriting nor practice did ever establish an
uniformity of extema^ Church discipline, and that perpetually to hold. This
they ^^te: and thus they walk. Which is directly contrary to the (...) fice of
Christ's Prophecey, and highly derogatory to his fait^full performance thereof.

But it will be said here, that The forvvard preachers and professors.
some among them are otherwise minded hereyn: and have D^clar. of Eccles.
discrip. page 8. and 9. Demo^str. cap. 1. T. C. first and second reply.
published that Christ is that Prophet like unto Moses, who has plainly and
perfitly declared unto us from God (as all other things which belong unto our
duties, so also) whatsoever is needful for the government of the Church:
whom we ought to hear and obey. And that if they should not acknowledge
thus, they should ^ob him of some part of his prophetical office, or prefer a
servant before the only begotten Son. Which they do, who think that Moses
left all things perfitt, but Christ either began them not, or did not finish
that he began.

Thus I grant some others of the better sort among them have written and
published. But these their books and writings are not allowed among them, but
called in and repressed by publik authority. And that which is more in this case,
such ^^^fession and writing does not only afford them no help in ^heyr
estate, but does rather make their sin the more grie^ous, inasmuch as
professing they know these things, they re^use nothwithsta^ding to walk
accordingly: whereas the Lord Jesus that Prophet, is not only in word to be
acknowledged (...) have left a perfitt order unto his Church, but is also in
deed (...) be hearkened unto and obeyed thereyn, and in no other. For a Deuteronomy.
18. 18 19. with Act. 3. 22. 23
spoke the Lord unto Moses concerning Jesus Christ, ^ying: I will raise them
up a Prophett from among their bre^ten like unto thee, and will put my words
in his mouth, and (...) shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
And ^^hosoeuer will not hearken unto my words which he shall ^eak in my
Name, I will requier it of him. John Baptist li^^wise Ioh. 13. 36. with Psalm.
2. 12.
testified concerning Christ thus, He that believes (...) the son bath
everlasting life: and he that obeys not the ^onne, shall not see life, but
the wrath of God abides on him. ^here is to be observed how the Spirit of God
describes sa^^ng faith by the obedience of Christ: teaching us that they which
obey not the Son in deed, whatsoever profession they ^ake of him in word,
cannot assure themselves they beleev in (...) to eternal life. The same is
taught in the Epistle to the ^^^ewes. Where it is Heb. 5. 9.
said of Christ the Son, that being ^^secrate, he was made author of
eternal salvation to all that (...) him. To which purpose we may also observe
in the Romans 1. 5. and 16. 26. He^. 11. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. etc. 1. Pet. 2* 4. 5. 6.
7. 8. 9.
Scriptures the often joining of these two together, faith, and the obedience
of faith. But this being noted by the way concerning that testimony of John: I
proceed yet further to show that Christ that Prophet requires not only
acknowledgment in word, but obedience indeed to all his ordinances given to his
Church. This we learn both of Christ himself and of his Apostles. Of Christ
himself, in his M^t. 28. 1^. 19. 20.
last and great commission given to his Apostles, when he sent them into the
world, to publish his faith, and plant his Churches therein. In which he
straightly charged them to teach all his people baptized in his name, not to
acknowledge only but, to keep and observe whatsoever he had commanded them:
and that even to the end of the world: not making any exception of Christian
or heathen Magistrates, of their allowance or disallowance, or of any other
worldly respects whatsoever. The Apostles also as they were commanded, so they
performed: both 1 Cor. 4. 17. et. 11. 1. 2. 23. et. 12. 5. 18. 28. et. 14. 33.
37. Col. 2. 5. Gal. 1. 11. 12. Ephesians. 4. 11 12. Tit. 1. 5. Act. 14. 23. et 20.
17. 27. 28. 1 Pet. 1. 13. et. 5. 1. 2. 3 4. 12.
pla^ting the Churches in that faith and order which Christ prescribed them,
and 1. Tim. 6 3. 4. 5. 13. 14. Col. 2. 8. 18. etc. 1 Cor. 14 37. Ephesians. 4. 11.

ver. 3. Gal. 1. 8 9. Rev. 22. 18. 19.
requiring of the Churches so planted and of all other after them to the end of
the world to keep that faith and order wherein they were set, and to admit of
no other whatsoever, but to keep that without spot and unrebukable, until
the appearing of ovvr Lord Jesus Christ. And thus much concerning this matter.
Only I will now add the confession and testimony of these men themselves
concerning this point in hand, This have Dem^ns. cap. 1. pro. 1.
they written and published, From that form of governing the Church, which
together with the offices that are to execute the same, the word of God
perfitly descubeth unto us, no Christian Church ought to svvarue. Now herewith
compare their estate and practice, and you shall find that they do not only
swerve from that form of government appointed by Christ to his Church and so
hearken not unto him as their Prophet: but do also receyv and submitt unto
another, even a false one, derived from Antichrist: as themselves have Admon.
to the Parl. T. C. first and second reply. Sermon on Romans 12.
taught, and therefore have sued to the Parliament to have it removed. Thus we
see how their sin is made far the greater and more fearful, whiles contrary
to their knowled^ they wittingly persist in disobedience against Jesus Christ
that Prophet of his Church: as if he were not come in the flesh, or as if not
he, but man, yea the man of sin we^^ to be hearkened unto. And hitherto
concerning Christ^ Prophecy.

Next for his Priesthood, that towching it they do likewise* will thus appear.
The office of the Priesthood of Christ consists in two things: first, the
Ephe^. 1. 7. and 5. 2. Col. 1. 20 Heb. 9. 28. Romans 8. 34 1 Ioh. 2. 2.
Redemption he has made for the world in the blood of his cross, appearing
once to put away sin, by the sacrifice of himself: secondly, the Heb. 7. 25
and 9. 24. Romans 8. 34. 1. Ioh. 2. 1. 1. Tim. 2* 5.
Intercession he makes with the father, being entered into heaven, to appear
now before the face of God for us. Now towching the first, that is, the work of
Redemption, as if they counted the blood, of the Testa^ent an unholy thing,
they profane ^^in Rev. 14. 9 Number. 16. 40. Ezech. 44. 7. and 2. Ioh. 7. compared
with Ephesians. 4. 11. 12.
administering and receyving the word and Sacraments of that reconcilation in
and from an Antichristian ministry: and more particularly in the Sacraments,
they Lament. 1. 10. Ezech. 16. 19. and 22. 26. Ier. 23. 17. 2. Cor 6. 14. 15.

prostitute that precious blood of the cross of Christ (even of that Lamb
undefiled) unto Atheists, Idolaters, persecuters, whoremongers, drunkards,
sorterers, witches and the most profane of the land and their seed. That it is
thus with them, may be seen not only in their ungodly continual practice: but
even by their own confession and writings. Towching their ministry thus they
Admon. to Parliam. treatise 2. section, 14. 15. 16. 17. 20.
write, We have an Antichristianhierarchy and a popish ordering of ministers,
strange from the word of God never heard of in the Primitive Churches, but
taken out of the Popes shop to the destruction of Gods kingdom. Yet in and
from this ministry they minister and receyv the word and Sacraments. Towching
the other also, thus A plain declaration of Eccles. discip. page 172 T. C.
first ^eply. page 167.
they write of themselves and their estate, whereas in the holy Communion of
the Lords supper, Christ the true Paschall lamb ought to be communicated only
to such (as far as men can judge by their outward profession) to whom Christ
himself belongs: among us the holy Sacraments are communicated with the
Papists; the holy mysteryes of God profaned, the Gentiles enter into the Temple
of God, the holy things are indifferently communicated with clean and
unclean, circumcised and vncircvmcised. And as VVhi^g. defense against T. C.
page 176. 178 639. 646.
another among them sticks not to affirm and mainteyne, that now the Church
is full of drunkerds, whooremougers, Idolaters, superstitious persons, papists
Atheists, and such like. This is their own confession, besides their estate,
concerning the first.

Towching the second, that is, Christ's Intercession with the father, they
profane it likewise two ways: first, by retaining a Book of ordering Priests.
An^ book of common prayer.
priesthood, as an office of ministry, to offer by their public prayers and
other service unto God: which now can be nothing else, but either a continuing
of the Jewish priesthood abolished by Christ, who Heb. 7. 11. 12. 24. and 10.

or else a retayning of the popish priesthood devised by Antichrist: Of which
sort indeed it is, as hereafter will appear, and as Admon. to Parliam.

themselves have heretofore written and acknowleged. Neither will it any white
make for them, that Rev. 1. 6. and 1. Pet. 2. 5.
now all the faithful are by Christ made Priests to offer up spiritual
sacrifices unto God For eve^ by this it appears, that now the ministry and
priesthood differ betwee^ themselves: the one, to wit the priesthood, being
common to all the faithful, the other, that is the ministry, being proper to
such as are according to the word of God set apart thereunto. The second way,
whereby they profane Christ his Intercession, is by offering up in Christ's name
and mediatio^ their devised stinted popish worship and ministratio^ Which Esa.
29. 13. Mat. 15. 9 Deuteronomy. 12. 30. 31. 32. Ier. 7. 30. 31. Mal. 1. 7. 8. Rev. 22.
18. 19.
being never appointed by Christ, but devised by man, is abominatio^ unto God:
whereas on the contrary, Jesus Christ that everlasting Priest, makes 1 Pe^ 2.
5 Heb. 13. 15. Rev. 8. 3. 4.
his people an holy pr^esthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
unto God through himself. This also have the forward preachers and people among
them heretofore avowched, affirming to the Parliament, that Admon. to Pa^liam.
treatise. 2. and T. C. first reply* page 131. etc.
their book of Common prayer (wherein their publik worship and ministration is
set down) is culled and picked out of that popish dunghill the mass book, full
of abominations. Yet do they still offer it up to God in the mediation of
Christ: as is manifest both by the book it self and in their continual
practice. And thus have we seen with what i^piety they carry themselves also
towching the Priesthood of Jesus Christ.

Lasily, concerning his kingdom, howsoever they speak of the guydance of his
Spirit, yet in deed and in truth they refuse to be subject to him as Lord and
King of his Church. And this they manifest to all men, in that they Luke 19.
27. and 22. 25. 26. Mal. 1. 6. mat. 28. 20. with Ephesians. 4. 8. 11 12. Romans 12.

refuse to submite to the offices, laws, and order of government, which he as
Lord and king of his Church has appoy^ted thereunto: and not that only but do
also subject themselves to the ministry, disorder, and constitutions, which
Antichrist that son of perdition has invented and brought into the false
Church. The proof hereof is evident, first in their constitutions and practice:
then by their own confession and writings. Concerning both which first I refer
you to that which was said Page 30
before towching Christ's Pr^phery: as also to that which is spoken of this
matter every where throughout this trea^ise. And then I pray you consider both
the Scriptures quoted in the margent, and these sayings of theyrs in their own
writings, which directly concern the point we have in hand: and see if they
witness not as much themselves as they are charged withal by us.

On the one hand thus they write, that (...) of Eccle. discip. p. ^. 9
they must either confess that Christ has left us an order to live by, or else
spoil him of his Kingly office: That Se^^ ^. on Romans 12. page 17.
Christ the King and governor of his Church, must rule it by his o^n offices
and by his own laws, till his coming at the last day. That (...) cap 1.
reason. 13.
Christ is a king, who has prescribed laws unto his Church for the government
of the same, and will have them tied to no other, neither to disobey them which
he has set down.

Yet on the other hand (as towching their (...) estate they write thus of
themselves: That Admon. to P^lias. trea^ise. 2. Artic. 3.
their wor^^ and works are divorced: That Declar. of eccl^. discip. Page 70.
they do not in deed obey his precepts and laws, whom in words they acknowledge
to be their King: That Sermo. 1 on Romans 12. p. 33. 34. 65. 66. 67. 72. ^3
they do not only want the offices appointed by Christ, to wit, Pastors,
Teachers, Elders Deacons, Attenders upon the poor: but also remain in and
under the confusions and Antichristian offices of Archbishops, Bishops, D^anes,
Archdeacons, Deacons, Chauncelours, Commissaryes, Officials, which be rather
members and parts of the whore and strumpett of Rome, then of the pure virgin
and spouse of the immaculate Lamb: That (...). of eccles. discip. page 15.
the government of their Church is not taken out of Gods word, but out of the
Canon laws and decrees of Popes: Finally, that Dem^s. inpre^. to s^pposed

they reject Christ's yoke, and De monstr. i^ pr^^f. to the Reader.
retain that popish hierarchy first coined in the midst of the mystery of
iniquity, and that filthy sink of the Canon law which was invented and
patched together for the confirming and increasing of the kingdom of
Antichrist. Wherein as great indignity is offered unto Jesus Christ, in
committing his Church unto the government of the same, as ca^ be by mean
underlings unto a king in committing his beloved spouse unto the direction of
the Mistres of the Stevves, and enforcing her to live after the orders of a
brothel house.

These are their own sayings. And therefore even by their own confession it is
to true among them in this respect, which Demo^stra in (...) p^eef^ce a
foresaid.
one of themselves said: that turning out the orders which Christ has
prescribed in his word for the ruling of his Church, they give him the title
of a King, but deny him the authority belonging to the same: and so in truth
make him an Idol, making him to carry a shovv of that he is not, and with the
crucifyers of him putting a reed in his hand in stead of his iron rod, and
crovvning him with thorne^ in stead of the crown of greatest glory.

Thus have we showed, that in their constitution of Christ ministry, worship,
and government, they do not receyv and ^bey Jesus Christ in his own ordinance,
as their Prophet, Priest, and king. And therefore as they say of the papists,
so let them look it be not verifyed of themselves, in this respect, that
howsoever in words generally they profess, yet in deed and verity they do not
acknowledge Jesus Christ come in the flesh, that Prophet, Priest, and king of
the Church: and consequently (by the rule and judgment of the Apostle set down
in the Scriptures here alleged by ^r H.) are in this behalf not of God, but of
Antichrist.

The next Scripture Mr H. cites is from the Rev. 13. 5. 6.
book of Rebelatio^. The words be these, speaking of the beast here described.

There was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and
power was given unto him to do two and forty months.

And he opened his mouth unto blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his Name, and
his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

Rev. 13. 5. 6. This book of the Revelation whosoever reads over with a
single heart, and compares with it the event of things partly come to pass
already, partly morefully yet to be accomplished: considering on the one hand
that Rev. 17. 1. ^. and 13. 16 17.
the whore of Babylon has made all nations of the earth drunk with the cup of
her fornications: that Rev. 14. 8 and 17. and 18. cap.
she has already begun to fall, and daily more and more inclyneth to her full
desolation and destruction, which yet can never wholly be accomplished so long
as the Babylonish offices of Archbis^hops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons, and the
rest, with their courts, canons, worship, and procedings do continue: And on
the other hand that Rev. 14. 6. 7. and 11. 15. and 19. chap with 2. These 2. 8.
and 1. Co^. 15. 24. 28.
the Lord Jesus will by the light and power of his gospel condemn and abolish
that Babilo^ish whore with all her false offices and constitutions, and will
also reign in his Church by his own offices and laws, with his crown of glory
upon his head, and his scepter of righteousness in his hand, until he give up
the kingdom to God even the Father, that God may be all in all. Who so (I say)
reads this book, and considers these and such like prophecyes therein
contained in part already fulfilled, and yet morefully to be effected: shall
plainly see, that this book of all other most plainly deciph^reth and
condemns the Babylonish Antichristian estate and constitution of these
assemblyes, as they now stand under this Prela^y and other false ministry of
the land.

Now in particular for the Rev. 1^. 5. 6.
place of this book here alleged, that it likewise is verisfyd of their
ecclesi^sticall estate and dealings at this day, as heretofore it has be^ in
the Roman Empire and Apostasy elsewhere, may sufficiently be seen by that which
has Page 22. 23.
before ben said towching Daniels like prophetyes, where you may perceyv by the
sp^rialtyes there expressed how these men in their estate at this day have a
mouth that speaks great things and blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his
Lev. 22. 31. 32. Act. 26. 9. 1^ with 2 These 2. 4 mal. 1. 11. 12.
name, in speaking ill of his truth and ordinances: and his Tabernacle, that
is, his 1 Timothy 3. 15. Lev. 26. 11. 12. Ezec^ 37 26. 27. 2 Cor. 6. 16.
Church, which is the house of the living God, and Tabernacle wherein he
dwells among the sons of men on earth: and them that dvvell in heaven, that
is, the Psalm. 83. 3. with Phil. 3. 20. Rev. 11. 19. and 12. 17. Luke 21. 27.
28.
Lords secret ones, whose conversation is in heaven, whiles they live here on
earth keeping the ^^mmaundements of God, and having the testimony of Jesus
Christ, whom they look for from the heave^s for their full redemption. But
these things being before in the handling of Daniels prophery declared in many
particulars, it shall not be needful here again to repeat them. Only in this
place it shall be good to note this moreover, that in this chapter and book Mr.
H. might have set down many other places describing the propertyes of
Antichrist: and that not only in regard of his doctrine and deceit thereof,
but also in respect of his tolourable pretense to be of Christ and for him, yet
forcing all people to stand subject to his own adulterate discipline,
ordinances, and jurisdiction. To which end it is to be observed, that
Antichrist is here described to have Rev. 1^. 11.
two horns like the lamb, pretending his ministry and authority to be of
Christ and for him, but yet shall speak like the dragon, in his false
doctrines, imposed traditions, blaspheming the truth, reviling the witnesses
thereof, and advauncing himself and his own inventions above God and his
commaundeme^ts. Moreover that he shall Rev. 13. 16.
make all both small and great, rich and poor, bond and free, to take his mark
in their forehead and hand, and so to submitt to his ministry, leiturgy,
courts, excommunitations, and the rest of the actions of his usurped authority:
Or else Rev. 13. 10. 15. 17.
kills, banisheth, and imprisoneth all such as refuse so to do, not suffering
them either to enjoy any liberty o^priviledg in the world, or to perform any
worship to God, but according to his own in ventions and apostasy. Which h^w
true they ar^ of the Prelacy and other Clergy of these assenblpes, let their
estate and daily actions be witnesses.

Hitherto also might be referred other scriptures of this book verifyed in them
likewise: for example, that as Rev. 9. 3. 7. 8. 9. 10. Here see the note upon
the third verse of this chapter, in our great English Bibles.
the (...) spoken of in the ninth of this book, were like unto horses prepared
to battle, having on their heads crowns like unto gold, and faces like men,
and hair as women, and teeth as lions, and habergions of iron, and tails as
scorpions with stings in them, having power to hurt for a season: so the
Prelates and other Clergy of Antichrist, are f^erce as horses to fight against
the truth and people of God, having rule and dominion with Lordly titles and
princely dignities, in outward face and show pretending to be the Ministers of
Christ and his Church, but in deed being deceitful entising and lascivious as
harlots, and ravenous cruel poysonfull and singing as Lions and scorpions,
having power to hurt and deceive for a season, albeyt their (...) and malice be
limited and repressed by the providence and power of the most High: Again,
that as Rev. 9. 11
those locusts with men's faces were all of them under Abaddo^ their King the
Angel of the bottomless pit, so the Prelates and other* Clergy of Antichrist
howsoever they pretend to be the Ministers of righteousness, are in deed the
subjects of Satan the Prince of dar^nes, who yet transformeth himself into an
Angel of light. Moreover that Rev. 17. 1. 2. and 18. 3.
they as well as other people and nations of the earth have committed
fornication with that whore of Babylon spoken of in this book: and have
received of her Rev. 17. 3. and 14. 11.
names of blasphemy (such as be the names of Archbishops, and Lord bisshops,
and Priests, when it is ascribed to an office of Ministry of the Gospel:) and
have Rev. 17. 4 and 14. 8.
drunk of her golden cupfull of abominations, whence have proceeded their
Ministry, book of common prayer, book of ordering Priests and consecrating
Archbishops and Bishops, excommunications by Archdeacons and Lordbishops, their
courts, of facultyes, Commissary courts, and such like among them: and fina^^
have been Rev. 17. 7 and 1. 9. 2. and 20. 4.
made drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs
of Jesus. So as these assemblyes in their ecclesiastical constitution and
procedings have showed themselves to be the natural Rev. 17. 5 with Ezech.
16. 44.
daughters of Babylon, that mother of vvhoredomes and abominations of the
earth: howsoever as Rev. 17 5. with 2. These. 2. 7.
a Mystery it ly much hid and is not easily espied, vnle^ Christ Jesus Rev. 3.
18
annoint ovvreyes with ey salve, that we may perceyv it, and Rev. 17. 1 3.
with a. These. 4. 8.
carry us forth as it were into the wilderness in the Spirit, to take a view
of it by the light of his word, and not as it makes show, and is esteemed
among men in the world. And thus much of this place and book of the Revelatio^
here alledge^

Now before Mr. H. comes to any other Scriptures, (...) this conclusion of the
former, that no Antichrist can be shovved whose doctrine is ^ound. Concerning
which I have answered page 1^. 11. 12. 13.
before, first that their doctrine also is unsound, and have showed it in
diverse false doctrines they hold and teach: and then that Antichrist the man of
sin teaches many true doctrines towching God, the Creation, Resurrection and
such like, yet notwithstanding is he an Antichrist, and his followers in
Antichristian estate. Otherwise if the reaching of some sound doctrines would
make such to be no Antichrists as do so teach, what Antichrists have there or
will there ever be in the world? Has there at any time ben any heretic or
Antichrist, that has not held and professed some truth together with his
here^y and Antichristianity? Nay, is not the truth that such a one teaches,
the very means by which his delusion is made the stronger? Then for that
truths sake he ought not the more to be hearkened unto (as these men reason),
but the more to be avoided (as Mr Beza has well Beza against Sa^avia. cap. 25.
page 193.
noted against Sara^ia) least under pretense of hearing the truth from him, we
be de^^pved by him. When the Man. 1. 24. and 5. 7.
devil himself acknowledged and said, that Christ was the Son of the most
High, that holy one of God: or when he does profess and teach it in the
offices 2. These. 2. 9.
he has brought into the false Church: shall we therefore allow such as
lawful ministers of Christ and abide members of such a Church: Or ought we not
rather to know that Christ (...) Mar. 1. 25
rebukes them and bids them hold their peace, has ^lso Rev. 18. 4. and 14.
9. 10. 11.
charged us to depart from all such and not to partake in their sins? It
neither is nor can be unknown (though it be (...) minded of many) that as 2.
Co^. 11 14.
Satan himself is tra^sformed ^^to an Angel of light, so Verse. 15.
his ministers (even such as stand in any false ministry) can transform
themselves as though they were the ministers of righteousness. Which they do no
may more subtly and forcibly effect then by means of the true doctrines
which they teach in the Antichristian offices they have ^^eybed. Thus we may
see, that the honey of some truth being mixed with the poison of their offices,
we can not from them cast the sweetness of the one, but we are withal in
present dain^^t to be destroyed by partaking with the other: and therefore
(...) not in this estate to receyv, but to avoid them altogether. ^itherto of
the Scriptures which Mr. H. has brought about the description of Antichrist:
and of his conclusion inferred therevpo^. The next Scriptures he alleges are
of another sort showing us who be true ministers, and which be true Churches.
The first is out of the Ioh. 10. 2. 7. 9.
tenth of John: where Christ speaks ^hus.

Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that enters not in by the door into the
fold of the sheep, but climeth up another way, he is a thief and a robber.

But ^e thath enters in by the door, is the sheepeard of the sheep Ioh. 10.
1. 2. And again Jesus said unto them.

Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.

All that ever came before me, are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not
hear them.

I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in
and go out, and find pasture,

Ioh. ^0. 7. 8. 9. HEre in deed is a special mark to know ministers by, t^
wit, if they enter in by the door into the sheepfold, that is, up Jesus
Christ into his Church. Now to enter invp Jesus CHrist, is either Gal. 1. 1.
Amo^ 7. 15.
immediately to be called by CHrist himself, as were the Prophets and Apostles:
or else Act. 6. 3. 5. and 14. 23. and 20. 28. Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 1. Tim. 3. Chap.
Tit. 1. 5. 6. etc.
mediately to be called by his Church, to such offices as he has given for the
work of his ministry, according to such rules as he has appointed to that
end. Seeing then the publik ministers of these assemblyes are neither
immediately called by Christ himself, nor mediately by his Church: neither to
such offices as Christ has set in his Church: nor according to such rules as
he has prescribed thereunto: it is manifest they enter not in by the door,
that is, by Jesus CHrist, but climb up another way, to wit, by their Book of
ordering priests and deacons.
deaconry and priesthood receyved of the Prelates and derived from Antichrist.
And therefore are not true ministers appointed by Christ and his Church, but
thieves and robbers belonging to Antichrist and his defection. The further
proof whereof, besides their continual practice and present estate, I refer to
his proper place in that which is to be spoken In the answer to the sixth,
^ight, and ninth, sections.
hereafter towching the second part of the Reason, and in that place towching
their priesthood and entrance into the ministry. In the mean time only I
putt them in mind that they have granted thus much of themselves heretofore,
as I affirm, that is, that Admo^. to Parliam. ^reatise, 2. sect. 16.
they enter not in by Christ, but by a popish and unlawful vocation. These are
their own words. But of this more hereafter.

That in this place Mr. H. translateth Christ's Io^. 10. 2
word^ thus (he that leads the sheep in at the door) albeyt the thing ^e
true that the true pastors do so and that the sheep so led find pasture and
salvation in Christ: Yet his translation here is untrue, and some what subtle,
to the end (as it seems) he might with better color have some defense for
their ministry from this Scripture. For Christ's speech here is not, he that
leads in at the door, but thus, he that enters in by the door, As may be
showed diverse ways: first by the proper signification of the words here used,
whereof the E^serchome. 1^5.
one signifies to enter in or to come in (not, to lead in,) and the Diates
^huras.
other signify, by the door (not, in at the door:) secondly by the contrary
which Christ opposes unto it in the Ioh. 10. 1
former verse, when he says, he that Ana^ain^n.
clymeth (not, he that leads up) another way is a thief and a robber: thirdly
by the several propertyes which here Christ attributes to all false ministers
opposed to the other, as first, that they are Ioh. 10. 1. 8.
thieves and robbers, that is, such as burst into the house an other way then
by the door, and in stead of well ordering the house, make spoil of them that
dwell in it, even making merchandise of their souls and consciences: Next,
that they are Ver. 5.
strangers; that is such whose offices and callings are strange from the word
of God and ordinance of Christ, and therefore ought always of his Church to be
accounted as strangers, and their voice not to be hearkened unto: lastly, that
they Ver. 8.
came before Christ, that is, be such as do not follow after him, way^ing for
his calling, and walking in his way which he has set us, but do intrude
themselves without him and follow another way devised by themselves and never
prescribed by him.

Here also would I ask Mr H. whether one being in no office of ministry, yet
taking upon him publikly to teach, and (as here he says) leading in at the
door, that is, teaching no other means of salvation but Christ only who is
the door of the sheep: whether such a one (I say) were therefore to be reputed
a Pastor and, minister of Christ, lawfully set in that office? I am assured
Mr H. will not say it. For that were both to give allowance of intrusion, which
Christ ^ondemneth: and to open a door to the annihilating of that order with
Christ has appointed his Church for the entrante into his ministry. And now
if such a one were not therefore to be accounted in such office of ministry,
much less will such teaching approve him that stands in an Antichristian
office, to be a Pastor or Minister of Jesus Christ.

It may also further be observed, that Christ in this Ioh. 10. 2.
Scripture speaks of such as be shepeards of sheep: and therefore that it
helps not the ministers of these assemblies, who commonly stand herds of
swyne, their Church being an hold of all foul spirits, and a cage of every
unclean and hateful bird. Besides that they all, even the most religious
among them, so long as they continue members of that Church, stand subject to
their ecclesiastical courts, officers canons, worship, and the rest of their
abominations, and therefore as yet in that respect can not be accounted the
sheep of Christ, hearing his voice and obeying his precepts.

The next and last Scripture here alleged is out of the Mat. 16. 18.
16. of Matthew. Where Christ as king his Disciples whom they said he was: Peter
answered, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. Whereupon Christ
said again, I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I
build my Church: and the gates of hell shall not prevayle against it.

Mat. 16. 18.

Here we are taught upon what rock the true Church and lively members thereof
are built, to wit, upon this confession, that Jesus is the Christ the Son of
the living God. Now here we are to remember that Christ is described both by
his person, and office. Of which I have spoken Page 28. etc. In the explication
of 1 Ioh. 4. 2.
before at large upon like occasion concerning the testimonies alleged out of
the Epistles of John. To which therefore I refer you, not purposing here again
to make repetition thereof. Only thus much concerning this Scripture I will
further note: that as we learned out of Ie^us epistles to discern the Spirit
of GOD from the spirit of Antichrist, so here we are taught how to know the
true Church of God, and so to discer^e it from the false Synagogues of
Antichrist: that is, by considering whether it be built upon the rock Jesus
Christ, that Propher, Priest, and king of his Church. For (as the Apostle 1
Cor. ^. 11.
says) other foundation can no man lay, then that which is laid, which is
Jesus Christ. But as before we showed, so here we are to remember, that a
verbal and general profession of Christ in word being denied in practice,
will not avayle to make either the popish or these assemblyes the true Churches
of God, and not the apostate Synagogues of the man of sin.

The Apostle Peter (to whom with the other disciples this was spoken, although
in the manner of speech Christ alluded to Peter's name, as signifying a stone or
rock) he laying this foundation in the Churches which he planted, Jesus Christ,
that chief corner stone, elect and precious, does 1 Pet. 2. 6. 7. 8.
thus further apply it unto them, saying, Unto you which beleev it is precious:
but unto them that be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the
same is become the head of the corner: and a stone to stumble at, and a rock of
offense even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient. Where he
plainly teaches, it is the obedience of faith; which is required of all such
as are truly baylt upon this rock and corner stone, Jesus Christ.

And this has Christ himself also taught us, when he Mat. 7. 24. 25. 26. 27
like^ed him that hears his words and does them unto a wise man which has
built his house on a rock, against which the rain and floods and wynds
prevayle not to cast it (...): and him that hears his words and does them
not, unto a foolish man which has built his house upon the sand, against which
the rain and floods easily prevayle to beat it down. So in like manner we are
to know for the question in hand, that the true Church of CHrist is as a Pro 9.
1 and 31. 10. 11. 12. Ephesians. 5. 23. 24.
wise woman and faithful wife which harkening to the voice of her husband
yields obedience unto him, and as an Mat. 16. 18. which pro 9. 1.
house built upon the rock, against which the gates of hell shall not be able
to prevayle: Whereas the false Church of Antichrist is as the Pro. 9. 13 -- 18.
and 7. 10 -- 23. Hos. 2. 2.
foolish woman and harlott, which howsoever she pretend to hear the voice of
Christ, yet in deed follows the lust of her own eyes and goes a whoring
after her own inventions: yea and pretending only the name of Christ, but in
deed not receyving him as her Prophet, Priest, and king, is as an house built
upon the sand, which the 2 These. 2. 8. Rev. 18 8 21. Esa. 13. 19.
breath of Christ's mouth and wynd of his judgments will in the end consume and
scatter abroad as the dust. It is not then a verbal profession in general
that will serve, where an actual denial in practice is joined withal. But
the true Church which is built upon the rock does in deed and truth obey the
Lord Jesus acknowledging him to be such as he is revealed unto us in the word
of God.

This the Apostle Paul likewise teaches us, when he Ephesians. 2. 20.
says, the Church is built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,
Jesus Christ himself being the head corner stone. Wherein he gives us to
learn that that is in deed the true Church which is so built upon Jesus
Christ, as the Apostles and Prophets have laid him for the foundation and head
stone in the corner, that is, have taught him to be the Son of God come in
the flesh, the Prophett, Priest and king of his Church for ever. Which
forasmuch as these together with the popish assemblyes do not in deed and
verity acknowledge, howsoever in words generally they profess, as has Page 30.
etc.
before at large ben pro^ed: it therefore follows, that in this estate they
cannot be esteemed truly built upon the rock Jesus Christ: and therefore cannot
be counted the true Churches of God, whiles we try them by the rules given us
by the Prophets and Apostles, and by Christ Jesus himself.

And thus have I showed the several Scriptures here ^i^ed by Mr H. to be so
many witnesses against themselves. Thus also have we seen both their doctrine
to be unsound, and their ministry and Church constitution to be such as was
never appointed by Christ, but derived from Antichrist. And therefore by none
to be continued in, but of all to be separated from, and that upon pain of
everlasting condemnation. For so has the 2 these. 2. 10 11. 12. Rev. 13. 8. 9.
and 14. 9. 10. 11. and 18. 4 5.
Scripture testified.

Hitherto of Mr H. his first exception. Now his second follows in these words.

Mr. H. his letter. Section, 4.
SEcondly, we are able to prove that greater corruptions have been found in
those Churches, unto which the holy Ghost in the Scriptures has given notable
testimony: 2. King. 12. 23. and 14. 3. 4. 2 Chronicles. 20. 31. Matthew. 15. 5. 6.
Luke 3. 2. and 2. 22. 27. Mat. 8. 4. and 23. 2. 3. 2 Cot. 11. 21. 22. and 15.
12. ^^vel 2. 14. 15. 20. 21.

Answer to section, 4.
WE answer, they must first probe their assemblyes to be true Churches set in
the way of Jesus Christ, before these or any Scriptures (which show true
Churches subject to corruptions) can any way help to defend their present
Church estate. Otherwise they do but still beg that which they should prove.
For what though the Churches established in the order of Christ have had and
still shall have diverse corruptions arising among them? Does this therefore
give any warrant or allowance of such assemblyes, whose constitution is
Antichristian? Was Israel in her defection a true Church, because Judah being
the Church of God had some enormityes in her? Or shall the assemblyes in Italy,
England, and such like standing in apostasy he true Churches of God, because in
the Churches of Corinth, Pergamus, Thyatira, established in the order of
Christ, there were found diverse corrup^ions? If this reason were strong, might
not Rome at this day justify most of her abominations? But what says the
Scripture, Israel in her defection was Hos. 2. 2. and 4. 15.
no wife, no true Church, but an harlott, and not to be joined unto:
notwithstanding that Judah being a spouse and true Church had not yet the 2.
Chro. 15. 15. 17 and 20. 31. 32. 33.
(...) places taken away? In like manner shall that Rev. 17. 1. 5. and 10. 4.
whore of Babel standing in apostasy together with all the assemblyes
wheresoever made drunk with the cup of her formications be harlots and to be
departed from: notwithstanding that the Rev. 2. and 3. chap.
Church of Christ being his spouse falls daily into many sins and
transgressions, whiles it is militant here on earth. For these two are of a far
diverse nature and consideration, I mean on the one side, a Church set in the
way and order of Christ, but walking therein weakly and corruptly: and on the
other side, a company of people standing in the defection and disorder of
Antichrist, howsoever perhaps they may walk there in with some show of piety and
religion. The former are Levit. 4. 13. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 2. 11. Act. 15. 1. 2.
Rev. 2. and 3
true Churches, notwithstanding the corruptions arising among them, the
redress of which is duly to be sought: The latter are Rev. 13. 11. and 17. 5.
and 18. 3 4. 2. these. 2. 3. 1. Ioh. 4. 3.
false Churches, and to be forsaken, whatsoever show of holiness they do or can
pretend. Now the^ forasmuch as neither Mr H. nor any other of them has proved
their assemblyes to stand in any other Church-constitution, but such as is
Antichristian: it is evident that the Scriptures here alleged, which speak
only of Churches set in Christ's order and of corruptions in them, cannot any
way fitly belong to these assemblyes, to give allowance of their Antichristian
estate. This being first set down generally concerning all these Scriptures
jointly together for the better understanding of the controversy: let us now
come to consider them more particularly, and see whether as Mr H. has under
taken to prove, so he have indeed performed, that is, have showed greater
corruptions in those Churches unto which the Scriptures give notable testimony,
then be in theyrs at this day.

The first 2 King. 12. 2. 3. and 14. 3. 4. and 2 Chronicles. 20. 31.
three Scriptures here cited are of one sort. These are the words.

Iehoash did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord all his days, that
Ieholadab the Priest taught him.

Notwithstanding the hy places were not taken away: as yet the people offered
and burnt incense in the hy places.

2. King 12. 2. 3. And Amaziah did that which was right in the eyes of the
Lord, yet not as David his Father: he did according to all that Ioash his
Father had done.

Notwithstanding the hy places were not taken away: as yet the people did
sacrifice and burnt incense in the hy places.

2. King. 14. 3. 4. And Iehoschaphat reigned over Judah: and he walked in the
way of Asa his Father, and departed not there from, doing that which was right
in the eyes of the Lord.

Howbeit the hy places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not
prepared their heart unto the God of their Fathers.

2. Chron. 20. 31. 32. 33. All these Scriptures show unto us one thing: which
is, that in the days of Iehoash, Amaziah, and Iehoschaphat, kings of Judah who
did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, yet the hy places were not
taken away: but the people did sacrifice and burnt incense therein. This in
deed was a corruption among those people: concerning which enough is spoken
before in that has be^ said towching these Scriptures generally. Yet this I
add further: first that in those times all the false ministeryes and kinds of
worship before time used were abolished, and this defect only of worshipping
God in the hy places as yet remaining. Now what comparison then is there
between this case, and theyrs who have not abolished but still retain and
join unto a false ministry and worship. Who knows not, that in those days
they might Ios. 22. 23. 29. 2. King. 16. 10. 11. 12.
not form to themselves or receyv from others any other altar or fashion
thereof for sacrifice then God had appointed: much less any new devised
ministry? Yea, the Levit. ^0. 1. 2.
sons of Aaron, though in a true and lawful office, might not offer with
strange fire: much less might they have received or exercised a false
u^lawfull ministry. Corah likewise Number. 16. Cap.
though a Levite, Datha^ and Ab^ram though heads of the Congregation, 2 Chro^.
26. 16* 20.
Dzziah though a king, might not offer up the incense which God had appointed
to be offered, being strangers from the priesthood: much less might they have
offered a false worship in a false ministry, etc. Which is the case of these
assemblyes. These men therefore should compare like things with like, and not
under color of the hy places in Judah, seek to retain and defend what
Antichristian corruptions they please in their Church. Otherwise why might they
not also under the same color still have kept the other popish abominations,
which already (by the mercy of God) are abolished out of the land?

Secondly I take it, the fault of retayning the hy places in Judah for the true
service of GOD which at first were made for false worship and service of Idols,
was such, as if now the false ministry, worship, and other abominations of
Antichrist were abolished out of the land, and yet these Idol temples (they
call them Churches) reserved and used for the true worship of God by a true
ministry. For these two may in diverse respects seem to be like, I mean, those
hy places, and these Idol temples. Both which I take to be with in compass of
Deuteronomy. 12. 2. 3. 4. Exodus 20. 4. 5. compared with 2. king 10. 26. 27. 28 and
23. 8. 13. 15. 19. Act. 19. 17. Rev. 18. 12. 22.
that moral commandment of God, which enioyneth the abolishing of the places
as well as of all the other monuments of Idolatry, either by rasing them quite
downor by defacing and converting them to civil use: and not to turn them to
be places for the public worship of God, though it were by such ministry and
in such manner as he has appointed.

Thirdly, by that which has been said, it is evident these Scriptures show not
that, for which they are alleged, that is, prove not greater corruptions to
have been found in the Churches aproved by the holy Gohst, then be now in the
Church assemblyes of England. I deny not but this sacrificing in the hy places
was a great corruption: And so the Spirit of God notes it, that 2 Chro. 27. 2.
with 2. King. 15. 34. 35.
the people herein corrupted themselves: yea and that they 2. Chron. 20. 33.
had not prepared their heart to the Lord. But for these men by color of this
to defend the re^ayning and using of their Antichristian ministry, in their
seerall offices, callings, administration and maintenance, with their, popish
worship and the rest of their abominations, it (...) not at all: but is rather
wholly against them, inasmuch as in 2. Chron. 15. 8 -- 17. and 1^. 3. 4. with
20. 31. 32. 33. and 26. 4. 5. and 27. 2. 3.
that Church of I^^KH the unlawful priest^ood and worship with other the
abominations in former times used were now taken away (this corruption of the
hy places only excepted, and the true wor^ship of God in place thereof
performed in such ministry and manner as he had ordained. Neither of which is
yet to be seen in this land.

Lastly, in these Scriptures is to be observed, both the different speeches
concerning the Kings and concerning the people in their ages, and that the
testimony which the holy Ghost gives of them is such, as has with it a note
of blemish and default in them: and that recorded to posterity, not to
encourage us to fail in like manner as they did, but to be a warning unto us to
take heed of being so overtaken, as they were.

And thus have I showed (so far as yet I see) the true meaning and use of these
Scriptures, and how they serve not at all to that purpose for which they are
brought: as they have been also and still are wrested by the Papists, to
boulster out their most filthy abominations likewise, though all in vain. For
great and strong is the truth, and will prevayle against all ad^ersaryes of it
in the end.

The next Scripture is out of Mat. 15. 5. 6.
Mat. 15. where Christ reproving the Pharisees for transgressing the
commandment of God by their own tradition, proves it thus: God has
commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother: and, he that curses father
or mother, let him die the death.

But you say, whosoever shall say to father or mother, (It is, or, be it) a A
gift, that is, devote unto God, or an oblation unto him.
gift whatsoever thou might be helped with of me.

And shall not honor his father or his mother, he shall be giltles. Thus have ye
made the commandment of God of no authority by your tradition.

Mat. 15. 4. 5. 6. Here we find a taste of that Mat. 16. 6. 12.
leaven of the Pharisees, whereof our Savior Christ bad his disciples they
should take heed and beware, and not that they should be encouraged thereby to
be more corrupt, as these men reason out of such places. But let us a little
compare this Scripture and their estate together, and see whether is to be
accounted more corrupt, they then, or these now.

First, we see here the disobedience taught by the Pharisees was against the
second Table: whereas the disobedience taught by these men in the points now
controverted is both against the first and the second Table. Against the first,
in teaching the people to Liod. ^0. 4. 5. Deuteronomy. 12. 30. 31. 32. Rev. 14. 9. 10.
11. and 13. 16.
wors^hip God by another ministry and after another manner then he has
appointed: yea by such ministry and in such manner as Antichrist has invented,
and God most straightly forbidden. Against the second, in Exodus 20. 12. Pro. 24.
21. 1 Timothy 2. 2. 1. Pet. 2. 17.
disobeying the Magistrates in deed, whom outwardly in show they would seem to
obey, whiles at their commandment they serve God by a false ministry and
worship imposed by them. For as Act. 4. 19. Dan. 3. 17. 18. and 6. 7. 13. 22.
1. Sam. 22. 17. 18.
true obedience to the Magistrates is always in the Lord: so is it
disobedience rather then obedience unto them, to obey them against the Lord.

Secondly, the Pharisees taught the people to neglect the performance of a duty
which they ought to their earthly parents in honoring of them: But these men
teach the people to neglect the performance of that Mal. 1. 6. 2. Cor. 6. 17.
18. 1 Pet. 1. 17. 18
duty they o^ to their heavenly father, in honoring fearing and worshipping him
as he has commanded.

Thirdly, the Pharisees taught the people to neglect man, under color of
keeping a ^ow, or doing a duty to God, to wit, the vowing or offering of that
as an oblatio^ to God, by which they should have helped their parents: But
these men teach the people to neglect God and his commandments, under color
of yielding obedience to ^an.

Fourthly, among the Jews this disobedience against man was taught by some,
not Mat. 15. 2 and 16. 12. Luke 1. 6. and 2. 25. 38.
receyved by all: But in these assemblyes their disobedience against God is
taught and (...) of them all.

Fifthly, the Pharisees and other Jews at that time (as may appear even by
some Mat. 8. 4 and 23. 2. Luke 2. 21. 27 as also Luke 1 6. 8. 9. 10. Ioh. 1.
19. 2^ and 6. 4.
places by Mr. H. here alleged) had not devised a new publik ministry and
worship, but retained that ministry and worship which God had appointed,
though they walked therein corruptly: But the ministers and people of these
assemblyes at this day have such ministry and worship as was never ordained by
God, but devised by that man of sin: though otherwise they make some show of
holiness and religion therein. So as in this respect there is no comparison
between these two.

Lastly, it is to be observed that the testimony here given concerning them
that so taught as is aforesaid, is not an approbation of them therein, but both
a Mat. (...) 3. 7. 13. 14.
sharp reproof of them, and an earnest admo^ition to others for this cause to
let then^ alone: together with this general sentence of Christ annexed
thereunto, Every plant which mine heavenly father has not planted shall be
rooted up. Let them alone: they be the bl^nd leaders of the blind: and if the
blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. Hitherto of this
Scripture of Matthew. 15. which we see being duly considered, neither proves
that for which it is produced, neither any way iustifyeth but rather condemns
their Antichristian estate.

Next he alleges Luke 3. 2.
Luke 3. 2. where it is thus written, When Annas and Caiphas were the chief
priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

Luke 3. 2.

This Scripture is directly against them. For here first it is plain, that for
the ordinary ministry among them they had not devised a strange new one, but
re^apned that ancient function of priesthood appointed by God (as the mention
of chief Priests does show): And whereas John Baptist did now exercise an
extraordinary ministry among them, it is noted, he did it not without special
warrant from the word of God thereunto. Which is further proved both in the
words Verse. 4.
follow^^^ in this chapter, and else where in Luke 20. 4. 5. 6.
this and the Ioh. 1. 22 23. 25. 33. Mat. 21. 25.
other Evangelists. Now if then they might not have any either ordinary or
extraordinary ministry but such only as was appointed and allowed by the word
of God: muchlesse may we now under the Gospel admit of any ministry but such
only as has been orde^^ed by CHRIST, owr Lord the king of his Church: wh^
being Heb. 3. 3.
the Son is worthy of more honor then Moses the servant. So as first we see
here, his own testimony condemns their present ministry, which is such as
was never prescribed by CHrist to his Church.

But it may be M r. H. meant by this Scripture to insinuate unto us, that there
were two hypriests at that time, whereas by the ordinance of God there should
be but (...) Whereunto I answer, first that it was no new thing, but an
a^^^cyent approved order among the Jews to have two chief priests over the
rest: Yet so, as the o^e of them was principal, and the other the second or
next unto him. Thus we read that 1. Chro^. 24. 2. 3. 2. Sam. 8. 17. with Nnm.
3. 32. and 4. 16. 28.
Zadok of the sons of Eleaz^r, and Ahim^lech of the sons of Ithamar were
together the chief priests in David's time. And afterward 2. King. 25. 18.
when the Jews were led captive to Babylon, Seraiah was the chief priest, and
Zephaniah the second. Where it may be observed, both that there was two
principal priests over the rest: and yet the one chief, and the other the
second.

Secondly, we find that Annas and Cayaphas here mentioned in Luke, were hy
priests the one after the other, to wit, Caiaphas Ioh. 11. 49. and 18. 13. 24.
Mat. 26. 57.
at the time when CHrist was crucified and before, and Annas afterward Act. 4.
6. and 7. 1.
when the Apostles Peter and John were brought before him. As also after this we
read again of one Ananias to be hy priest alone. Act. 23. 2. and 24. 1. and
25. 2.

Thirdly, it is to be minded that the word here used signifies chief priests,
and is spoken oftentimes of others that were chief among the priests, as well
as of the hy priest: and that even then when there was but one by priest. As in
Mat. 14. 53. Mat. 26. 57. Act. 25. 2. 15. and 24. 1. Luke 22. 52. 54.

Finally, the having of the hy priesthood then by course interchaungeably, and
but for a year, and such like, were in deed corruptions crept in among them in
the ordinance of GOD. Yet does not this give any warrant of the present
Antichristian constitution of these assemblyes. For even then we see they had
no new ministeryes, but the priesthood appointed by God, yea and but one hy
priest at once: Which also according to the law, kept in the kindred: whereupon
it is said, they that were of the chief priests kindred. Act. 4. 6. Besides
that in this often change of it, there seems to ly a mystery, God having so
disposed, to declare that now that Leviticall priesthood drew to an end, and
Hebr. 1. 7. 11 -- 25.
another Priest was to rise up after the order of Melchisedech, who because he
endures ever should have a priesthood that can not pass from him to any other.

So then from this Scripture can be gathered no defense at all of the present
estate of these assemblyes, but rather many arguments against it, forasmuch as
now among them they have no other but strange ministeryes inve^ted by man, and
then there was no such new ministry at all either ordinary or extraordinary
receyved among the Jews.

And this has Mr. ^artwright heretofore avowched, when proving the unlawfulness
of the offices of Archbishops and Archdeacons, he T. C (...) reply* page 83
sect. 5. 6. 7.
wrote as follows: First of all (says he) the ministry is by the word of
God and heavenly, and not left to the will of men to devise at their pleasure:
as appears by that which is noted of John, where the Pharisees coming to
John Baptist, after that he had denied to he either CHRIST, or Elias, or
another Prophet, Ioh. 1. 2^
conclude: If thou be neither Christ, nor Elias, nor of the Prophets, why
baptizest thou? Which had be^ no good argument, if John might have been of some
other function then of those which were ordinary in the Church and instituted
of God. And therefore John to establish his singular and extraordinary
function, alleges the word of God: whereby appears that as it was not
lawful to bring in any strange doctrine, so was it Note this.
not lavvfull to teach the true doctrine, under the name of any other function
then was instituted by God Let the whole practice of the Church under the
Law be looked upon, and it shall not be found that any other ecclesiastical
ministry was appointed, then those orders of hy priests, and Levites etc.
which were appointed by the law of God. And if there were any raised up
extraordinarily, the same had their calling confirmed from heaven, either by
signs or miracles, or by plain and clear testimonies of the mouth of God, or
by extaordinary exciting and movings of the Spirit of God. So that it appears
that the ministry of the Gospel, and the functions thereof ought to be from
heaven and of God, and not invented by the brain of men, From heaven (I say)
and heavenly, because although it be executed by earthly men, and the ministers
also are chosen by men like unto themselves, yet because it is done by the
word and institution of God that Note.
has not only ordained that the word should be preached, but has ordained
also in what order and by whom it should be preached, it may well be
accounted to come from heaven and from God. Seeing therefore that these
functions of the Archbishop and Archdeaco^ are not in the word of God, it
follovveth that they are of the earth, and so can do no good but much harm in
the Church.

And a little Page 84. sect. ^.
after he has also these words: Tell me (says he) in the whole volume of the
Testament is there any kind or degree of ministry, whereof God is not the
certain and express author? Was there ever any man (I except Jeroboam and all
such profane men) either so holy or so wise or of such great knowledge, that
ever did so much as dream of instituting of a new ministry? After the long
vvandring of the Arc in the wilderness when it came to be placed in
lerusalem, tell me if any besides the Levites and priests the ordinary
ministers, and the Prophets which were immediately s^irred up of God, were
found to have ordained any office or title which was not commanded: or
whether therevvas at any time any thing added or enjoined to those offices of
priesthood and Leviteship, which was not by the law prescribed.

These are M. Cartwrights words in the places here quoted. By which it is
clear themselves also grant, that in the time of the law in the true Church
there was no new ministry erected: and that there neither might nor may be any
either ordinary or extraordinary, but such as have express appointment and
warrant from God himself. Whereupon is follows that the present ministry of
these assemblyes having no such warrant, these and the like Scriptures give not
any defense of it, but condemn and make against it. Thus much concerning the
testimony alleged out of Luk 3. 2.

Next is alleged Luke 2. 22. 27. Mat. 8. 4.
Luke 2. 22. 27. and Mat. 8. 4. where it is thus written: first in the second
of Luke, concerning Christ: When the days of that is, Mary the mother of Jesus.
her purification after the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought that
is, Jesus.
him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,

(As it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every man child, that opens the
womb shall be called holy to the Lord:)

And to give an oblation, as it is commanded in the Law of the Lord, a pair
of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.

And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon: this man
was just, and feared God, and vvaited for the consolation of Israel, and the
holy Ghost was upon him.

And a revelation was given him of the holy Ghost, that he should not see
death, before he had seen the Lords Christ.

And he came in the spirit into the Temple, and when the parents brought in
the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the Law,

Then he took him in his arms, and blessed God, etc.

Luke 2. 22 -- 27.

And in the Gospel according to Mat. 8. ^
Matthew, Cap. 8. it is thus written towching the leper whom Christ cleansed:
Jesus said unto him, See thou tell no man, but go show thy self unto the
Priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a witness to them.

Mat. 8. 4.

These Scriptures compared together evince that this Church of the Jews had
not rejected but retained the publik ministry, worship, and ordinances
prescribed by God: and therefore wholly condemn the present estate of these
Church assemblyes of England, and are far from proving that for which they are
alleged. In the second of Luke we read, that at Luke 2. 21.
eight days old the child was circumcised, which was according to the Genesis 1^.
12. Levit. 12. 3.
ordinance of God: that Maryes purification, the child's presentation to the
Lord, and the oblation they gave, was (not after any new devised manner, but)
Lev. 12. 6. Exodus 13. ^.
according to the Law of Moses, and, as it is commanded in the Law of the
Lord: Finally, that Sim^o^ fearing God, came in the Spirit into the Temple
whither the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him (not according to
the custom and inventio^ of man, but) after the custom of the Law of God.
Where is to be observed, how often together in these few verses the holy Ghost
notes down that whatsoever was done to and for the child, was according to the
Law of Moses, the Law of the Lord, the custom of the Law, as it is written,
and, as it is commanded in the Law of the Lord. So this Scripture shows,
that the ordinances appointed by God for his worship were then observed. Now if
we join hereunto the Mat. 8. 4.
next Scripture of Mat. 8. we shall there find they had also that ministry
which God had ordained for the time of the Law. For there it is said, Christ
bad the leper being cleansed go and show himself to the priest, and offer the
gift that Moses commanded. Here then they had both the priesthood and
ordinances which God had commanded by Moses his servant. And therefore these
Scriptures are so far from pro^ing greater corruptions to have been in those
Churches, then be in these assemblyes: as they do directly condemn their
Church constitution in the new invented ministry, worship, and ordinances
among them, which God never ordained.

The next Mat. 23. ^ 3.
Scripture Mr H. cites is out of Mat. 23. where Christ spoke to the mulititude
and to his disciples, saying: The Scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses
chair: All therefore whatsoever they speak to you to observe, that observe and
do: but after their works do not: for they say, and do not.

Mat. 23. 2. 3.

This Scripture, teaching that it was lawful to hear the Scribes and
Pharisees that sat in Moses seat, is commonly alleged by the preachers and
professors of this age for their defense: Insomuch as they use it as their
anchor hold in greatest distress. But being well weighed, it will prove the
very shipwreck of their cause. For first, by conference of this Scripture with
Ioh. 1. 19 24. and 3. 1. 10. Mat. 23. 34. 35. 41. Mar. 12. 28. 32. 35. Act. 5.
34. De^t. 17. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.
others appears, that the Scribes and Pharisees which sat on Moses chair,
were priests and Levites, expounders of the Law or such Judges of hard pleas
and co^troversyes as we read of, Deuteronomy. 17. And therefore were not in any
strange ministry invented by man, but in those true offices which God had by
Moses commanded under the Law.

Secondly, the phrase of speech here used, when it is said they late on Moses
chair, Mr Beza. also thus takes it in his treatise against Saravia, Cap. 16.
unporteth and proves thus much. Which also may be gathered from a like manner
of speech used in Nehem. 9. 3. 4. 5.
Nehemiah, where we read that Ieshua, and Bani, and other of the Levites rose
upon the Levites stayre (or hy seat) and taught the people out of the Law, and
worshipped the lord.

Thirdly, Pharisaisme was not any new kind of ministry but only Act. 15. 5
and 26 5. Phil. 3. 5. Ioh. 1. 19. 24.
a sect among the Jews, that is, a sort of people (of So we read that Paul
and his father were Pharisees, of the tribe of Beniami^ Act. 23. 6. Phil. 3.
5. others of the tribe of Levi Ioh. 1. 19. 24.
what tribe soever among them) which seemed to have chosen and in outward show
pretended a more sirict observation of the Law, then others did.

Fourthly the Scribes knew well enough that every true ministry was from
heaven, not of me^: that is, was appointed by God, not devised by man. So far
were they from having themselves any false ministry of man's invention. This we
may see in Luke 20. 1. 7.
their co^sultation which they had among themselves what to answer unto
Christ's question, wh^^e asked them whether the Baptism of John were from
heaven, or of men.

Lastly, we find that the pharisees themselves were careful of not admitting
in that Church any new ministry that God had not ordained: Insomuch as Ioh. 1.
19. -- 27.
they were very earnest upon John Baptist, and urged him to approve his calling
and ministry by thr word of God. Which thing also he did. Ioh. 1. 23. 31. 33.

Now then seeing the Scribes and Pharisees here spoken of were (not in false
but) in true offices and functions appointed by God under the law: seeing they
sat (not on Baals, but) on Moses chair: seeing they knew there was no true
ministry but of God, neither would allow of any other then GODS word did
approve: yea, seeing John Baptist gra^nted thus much unto them, that he might
not have any ministry, but such whereof he could bring warrant from God: who
se^th not, that even this example of the Pharisees so much alleged by them,
plainly condemns the Ministers of these assemblyes, which sit not in Christ's
but Antichrists chair, entering into and executing such offices of Ministry,
as GOD never appointed or approved in his word? Neither is it of any moment, as
towching the point in controversy, to say, the Pharisees were corrupt in
doctrine and co^versation, unless the^ could show by the word of God their
ministers to be Pastors and Teachers in Christ's ordinance, though walking
corruptly therein: as we by the Scriptures show that the Pharisees which sat
on Moses chair, were priests and Levites, according to the Law of Moses,
though otherwise in many things they carried themselves very vngodily with much
hypocrisy.

The last 1 Cor. 11 21. 22. and 15. 12. Rev. 2. 14. 15. 20. 21.
Scriptures here cited by Mr H. are o^t of the Epistle to the Corinthians and
out of the Revelatio^. Which because they are of one sort, towching the
question in hand, therefore will I speak of them together. The words be these:
first in the epistle to the Corinthians, where the Apostle reproving their
abuses about the Lords supper, says thus unto them: Every one when they should
eat, takes his own supper before, and one is hungry, and another drunken.

Have ye not houses to eat and drink in? despi^e ye the Church of God, and
shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? in this
I praise not

1 Cor. 11. 21. 22.

And again to the ^orinthians, among whom some denied the resurrection of the
body, thinking that the soul only should live for ever in the world to come,
the Apostle writes thus concerning that matter, in the place alleged: If
Christ be preached that he is risen from the dead, how say some among you,
that there is not a resurrection of the dead?

1. Cor. 15. 12.

And in the second of the Revelation, first to the Angel of the Church of
Pergainus, Christ thus writes: I have against thee a fevv things, because thou
have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, which taught Balac to put a
stumbling block before the children of Israel, that they should eat of the
things sacrificed to Idols, and commit fornication.

So have thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans: which thing
I hare.

Rev. 2. 14. 15.

Then to the Angel of the Church of Thyatira, thus he says: I have against
thee a fevv things, that thou suffrest the woman Iezabel, which calls
herself a Propheresse, to teach and to deceyve my servants, that they should
committ fornication and eat of the things sacrificed to Idols.

And I gave her time that she should repent of her fornication: but she
repented not.

Rev. 2. 20. 21.

These Scriptures show errors and corruptions in such Churches as were planted
in the faith and order of Christ. Which nothing helps to mainteyne the
Antichristian ^state of these ^ssemblyes: as is Page 45.
before declared at large in the general answer concerning all these
testimonies. We never doubted, but the Lev. 4. 13 14. 1 Chronicles. 15. 13. and 2.
Chron. 30. 18. 19. 20. 1. Cor. the whole epistle.
best Churches on earth have fallen and still are subject to fall into
corruptions and transgressions of the Law of God. And how can it be otherwise,
when as they consist of sinful and mortal men, who both know but in part and
in the knowledge we have, walk with much weakness and imperfection? But what is
this to justify Antichrists apostasy, or to encourage any to partake in his
sins? We must always remember, that as it is one thing, when Romans 7. 19. 20.
Gal. 6. 1.
a true Christian is overtaken with a sin, and another when Romans 8. 13. 1
king. 21 20. Ephesians. 4. 17. 18. 19.
such as pretend to be Christians, live as the heathen and sell themselves to
work wickedness: so also towching a Church, it is one thing when a people are
settled in the order of Christ, but through weakness fall into diverse enormityes,
and another when a people stand in the defection of Antichrist and receyve the
print of his ordinances in their hands and foreheads. Either therefore must
they prove the constitution of their Church to be of Christ, and not
Antichristian, or else these examples in their estate will give them no succor
at all. For it will nothing avayle Babylon or such as comm^^ fornication with
her, to show that Zion has her breaches or her children their infirmityes.

Secondly, in these Scriptures is to be minded, that but some of the
Corinthians, and some of them of Pergamus and Thyatira were infected with the
errors and corruptions here recorded: and not the whole Churches generally. And
this is the lot and trial of the Church of God in all ages, that unto it do
creep men of corrupt mynds, who under a show of holiness often breed schisms
and errors in the Church, and in their lives tur^^e the grace of God into
wa^tonnes through hypocrisy. Thus it pleases God to try and exercise his
Church from time to time, that they which are approved might be known. Henre
it is, that in the Church of 1 Cor. 11 19.
Corinth spring up schisms and heresies: that in the Church of Act. 20. 30.
Ephesus arise men speaking perverse things to draw disciples after them: that
in the Churches of Rev. 2. 14. 15. 20.
Pergamus and Thyatira be found such as hold the doctrine of Balaam, and of the
Nicoiaitans, teaching the people to eat things sacrificed to Idols, and to
committ fornication. (And such also in these days have crept in among us,
under pretense of godlynes, who after a while upon one occasion or other have
manifested their ungodly, contentious, and fantastical spirits: and that
commonly with great trouble of the Church, being authors of grievous schisms
and other impietyes, for which the truth and Church have been and still are
evil spoken of). But these being but the personal sins of some particular
men, not the publik estate and constitution of the whole Churches: what
comparison is there between them and these assemblyes whose very 2 These. 2. 3.
4. 8. Reve. 18. 4. Esa* 52 11. Ier. 51. 6. 45.
constitution is Antichristian, and out of which God has absolutely commanded
all that will be saved to depart? Whereas from the Lev. 4. 13 14. 1 Cor. 1. 11.
and 5. 4. 5 7. Gal. 5. 9. 10 12. Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17.
other separation may not be made; but first redress is duly to be sought,
that such old leaven being purged out, they may still be a new lamp unto the
Lord.

Thirdly, here is to be observed, that it is said, these Churches Rev. 2. 14.
20. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 2
suffered such among them. Which as it manifests what was their sin, so it
shows also they had power, and should use it, for the reclayming or casting
out of such from among them. Whereas these assemblyes have not power to
redress any abominations or to excommunicate any persons (though never so
wicked): but the whole ecclesiastical power and jurisdiction among them is
committed only to the Ordinary, that is, to an Antichristian Prelate, and to
his Chauncelour and Archdeacon. So as by this also appears there is no
comparison between them.

Finally, it is to be remembered, that even in these and the like Churches,
where they do not repent and amend but continue in corruption and iniquity,
Christ has Rev. 2. 5. 16. 22. 23. Mat. 21. 42. 43.
threatened to remove his ca^delstick, and to take his kingdom from among them.
And if God thus deal with his own Churches stablished in his faith and order,
when they come obstinately to persist in sin and impiety: what shall be the
end of the Synagognes of Antichrist which stand in emnity against Jesus Christ
and in apostasy from his truth, and will not be reclaymed? If God will not
spare but come against Corinth, Pergamus, and Thyatira: will he let Babylon
that mother of whoredoms or any of her daughters escape? If Jerusalem for her
sin be made to drink the cup of Gods wrath: shall Edom, Moa^, or Ammon go
free? They shall not: says the Lord of hosts. Iere. 25. 15. 18. 21. 29. And
thus much to Mr. H. his second exception: Now follows his third in these
words.

Mr. H. his letter. Section, 5.
THirdly, if it be a sin for an whole Church to account any private man for
an heathen or publicane though he be known to have grievously sinned Mat. 18.
15. 16. 17.
(Mat. 18) till such time as by despising all lavvf^ll means that can be used
for reclayming him, he shall be found to sin of obstinacy: then must it needs
be a sin for any private members (such as you are) to account an whole
Church and so many famous assemblyes to be all as heathens and publicanes and
Antichrists, before their sin has been manifested unto them and they
proceeded against according to the rule of Christ.

Now this has not ben done unto us: for many there are of the ministers in
England, that are not yet in their judgment persuaded of the discipline: and
many that do yield unto it in judgment and desire heartily the establishment of
it, and the removal of all corruptions, cannot yet see how they may with a
good conscience forsake the callings and rooms they occupy, for the want of
the discipline. If these sin, they sin but of ignorance, and therefore may
not for this sin be accounted for heathens and publicanes.

But admit our sin had been manifested unto us: by whom have we ben ensured
for it? A private member may not be cast out till he have despised the censure
of the Church, though he have despised the admonition and counsel of sundry
private Christians: Then suerly an whole nation may not be cast out of the
Church, though it have not hearkened to the reproof of many private Christians,
till it shall be found to have despised the censure of other more famous Churches
professing the Gospel. And what such Church is there in the world that ^ath
censured us? Nay it is most evident that all those Churches in Christendom
that have in most syncerity receyved and mainteyned the doctrine and discipline
of Christ, have alvvayes accounted our Church for a sister, and given unto her
the right hand of fellowship.

I deny not but a private Christian may ^^islike the corruptions that are
allowed and practiced by an whole Church, he may refuse to subscribe or yield
his consent unto them, he may by prayer and all other good means seek the
reformation of them: but that any one private Christian or some fevv several
assemblyes, vvhereyn also there are some learned men, may account all the
Churches ^^at are in an whole nation to be either as heathens (that is, such
as are destitu^e of the word and Sacraments and service of God) or as
publicanes (that is, such as with whom they may not lavvfully commanicate and
join in the said service of God) that do I utterly deny.

And whereas the chief thing whereof you boast your selves against us, is
that you have Christ's discipline practiced among you, which we want: I
affirm and date bynd my self to prove it, that there is nothing practiced
amongst us so contrary to the discipline, as there is amongst you. For proof
whereof (to omit sundry of your practices and the extreme confusion that is
to be seen in your best reformed assemblyes) let this suffice that has been
already mentioned.

S. Peter Act. 2. 29 and 3. 17.
calls those Jews that had crucified Christ, breth^en. Act. 2. 29. and 3.
17. And Paul Gala. 1. 2 and 5. 2.
accounts the Galathians a true Church, when the errors that they were
fallen into were matters fundamental. Gal. 1. 2. and 5. 2. And this account
did these two holy Apostles make of them, because they had not ben yet
convinced and rejected by the judgment of the Church. And why should you or
any of your company (who for authority you know are not to be compared with
those holy Apostles) disdain to call us brethren, and to account us a Church,
till such time as we have been convinced of error, and rejected by the judgment
of other Churches?

When there grevv controversy in the Church of Antiochia, the brethren Act.
11. 21. 26. and 15. 2. 4. 23.
thought it not fit to proceed in judgment against them of the circumcision
though their errors were far greater then any are in our Church, and though
the belevers there were more in number and of greater graces then ever those
were of your company, Act. 11. 21. 26. and 15. 23. and so might with more
consent and authority have ended the matter at home without seeking further to
other Churches, yea though they had Paul and Barnabas (men better able to
decide and determine the matter then ever you had any in your assemblyes): yet
would they not (I say) proceed, till they had made other Churches, and na^ely
that famous Church of Jerusalem acquainted with the matter, and required their
advise and authority to decide and overrule it, Act. 15. 2. 4. And might it not
asvvell have beseemed those of your company that first intended a separation
from our Church (a matter of so great weight and consequence) to have sought
the advice of the Churches of Geneva, and France, and Germany, and Helvetia,
and Scotland in the matter, and to have stayed their separation till such time
as those Churches had proceeded against us according to the rule of Christ's
discipline? May I not well say, as the Apostle 1. Cor. 14 36.
does to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 14. 36. Came the word of God our from you?
either came it unto you only?

And this I hope may be sufficient to shovv how That which Mr H. says here
is untrue, he yielded unto it before as being true Page 5. Mark this
contradiction,
untrue that is, which is affirmed in the first part of the reason used in
your vvriting, viz: Whosoever works upon the consriences of men by virtue of
an Antichristian office and calling, he is an Antichristian Minister,
whatsoever truth he brings with him.

Answer to Section, 5.
IN this third exception according to their usual manner, Mr H. takes for
granted that which he should prove, to wit, that their ecclesiastical
assemblyes be the Churches of Christ set in his order and constitution: Which
thing we deny. And till they prove it, themselves may see, they can not thus
reason from Matt. 18. 15. 16 17.
this Scripture of Mat. 18. as here he does. For although from thence it may be
gathered, that the Churches of Christ are not for corruptions arising in them
to be forsaken, but first their redress is by all good means to be sought:
yet it follows not therevpo^ that the Synagogues of Antichrist are in like
manner to be proceeded withal, and not forthwith to be avoided. This (I say)
follows not of the other any more then if one should reason thus: A brother
being known to have sinned is not to be accounted as an heathen or publicane,
till being duly proceeded with, he have contemned the voice of the Church:
Therefore also one that is an heathen or publicane, yet notwithstanding is not
so to be accounted, till he have been likewise admonished and proceeded withal.
As there is no consequence in this, so neither is there in the other. The same
1. Cor. 5 12.
Scripture which says, Do ye not judge them that are within? says it not
also, What have I to do to judge them that are without? Now then as we are to
carry our selves after one manner toward particular men that are within, and
after another toward them that are without: so have we also different rules
and courses prescribed by God and to be followed by us, how to walk after one
manner toward the Churches of Christ, when corruptions be found among them, and
after another toward the Synagogues of Antichrist which are fallen into
defection from the way of Jesus Christ.

If you ask, what these rules be that are given to be observed when errors and
enormityes are espied in a true Church: I answer, these and the like, that
Lev. 4. 13. 14. Act. 6 1. 2. 3. 2 Chro. 13. 2 3. with 15. 3. 11. 12. 13.
they which espy them, are not thereupon to forsake the Church, but must first
give the Church knowledge thereof out of the word of God: and that also
according to due order, as first to 1 Cor 1. 11. with Rev 2. 1. etc. Zach. 7.
2. 3. Heb 13. 17.
make it known unto them to whom the oversight of the Church is committed:
who, if they be persuaded, are 1. Cor. 5. 1. 4. 5. and 11 18. etc. Mat. 18. 17.
1 Timothy 5. 17.
then by duty bound to advertise the Church thereof and to see it redressed in
all good manner. If they be not persuaded, then Mat. 18. 16. 17. with 2 Cor.
13. 1. Lev. 4. 13. 14
having taken some others with them and not prevayling, they are afterward to
bring it before the whole Church and to show them their estate, wherein it
swarveth from the rules of Gods Law: who fynding it so to be, are bound to
acknowledge and amend it. Yet if this way they prevayle not, then are they to
use (if they may) the help of Act. 15. 2. etc. 1. Cor. 14. 33. 36. Zach. 7. 2.
3. De^t. 17. 8. 9 10. 11. Psalm. 122. 3 4. 5.
other Churches to advise of the matter and to admouish that Church of their
estate, out of the Scriptutes. Now these things being done as they ought, we
may hope by the blessing of God that issue will follow which the 2 Co^. 7* 8.
11. Act. 11. 18. and 15. 31 Levi^. 4. 13. 14. 15.
Scriptures show has followed upon such proceeding heretofore, that is that
they will not now wilfully stand in known transgression convinced unto them
out of the word of God by so many witnesses: but will rather sorrow for their
sin, and rejoice for the consolation they shall find by receyving the truth
and walking in the way thereof showed unto them out of the Scriptures. But if
they will not amend, the Lord Jesus Christ, who walks in the nuddes of the
golden candelsticks and has all power given him in heaven and in earth, has
Rev. 2. 5, Mat. 21. 43.
threatened to remove the candelstick out of his place, and to take the kingdom
of God from them and to give it to such as will bring forth the fruits thereof:
And then to such as are willing to obey the truth, he has in such cases given
direct Act. 2. 40. Psa. 8. 12. 16.
commandment, to save themselves from such a froward generation: and to bynd
up the testimony, and seal up the Law among his disciples. And these are the
rules (so far as I have observed) given us for our walking in and toward the
Churches of Christ, when errors and corruptions be found among them.

Now towching such assemblyes as stand in false constitution or apostasy from
the way of Christ, the former rules are not given us to be used in and with
them: but concerning such, there is one only rule prescribed by God for our
carriage toward them, which is, Rev. 18. 4. ^os. 4. 15. A^os. 4. 4. 5 and 5.
5. 15. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Rev. 20. 4.
with all speed to separate and depart from them, and in no case to partake in
their sins, but to witness against them even unto death. Forasmuch then as
these assemblyes (how famous so ever he account them) stand in a false
constitution, even in apostasy from that true ministry and from those holy
ordinances appointed by Christ to his Church, it is cl^are as the sun that
the golden rules of such proceeding as is before described belong not unto them
in this estate, but that all men ought upon pain of damnation without delay to
depart out of them, least if they still partake in their sins, they receyv
also of their plagues. By which also appears how the reason here used by Mr
H. out of Mat. 18. belongs not to their assemblyes, as now they stand, and
therefore in this case helps them nothing at all.

Nay furthermore I dare affirm and bynd my self to prove by this Scripture,
that there is not (in their constitution) any ecclesiastical assembly in this
land that can be accounted a true Church, whereyn this rule here given by
Christ can be practiced. And thus I prove it: Every true Church of Christ has
Christ's power here spoken of, to cast out obstinate sinners from among them.

But no ecclesiastical assembly in this land has (in their constitution) this
power of Christ here spoken of, to cast out obstinate sinners from among them.

Therefore no ecclesiastical assembly in this land can (in their constitution)
be accounted a true Church of Christ.



The proposition or first part of the reason is proved by Mat. 18. 17. 18. 19.
20.
this place of Scripture: as also by 1 Cor. 5. 4. 5. and Mat. 28. 20. The
assumption or latter part of the reason I prove thus: First, the power of
excommunication among them rests in the Lordbishop and in his Chauncelor and
Archdeacon, whose offices and authority Christ never ordained in his Church:
therefore can not they (in their constitution) have the power of Christ here
spoken of. Secondly, the offices and authority of the Prelates aforesaid are
Antichristian: therefore also ca^ they not in such estate have this power of
Christ: For 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15.
what fellowship can there be between Christ and Antichrist? Thirdly, let us
suppose, that some of their Church commits a sin, and is admonished to
repent of it by another of them: the sinner repents not, the other takes
with him one or two to admonish and witness against him: the sinner
notwithstanding still persisteth: Now what shall the other do, or whither shall
they go? If to the Prelates and their Officials, who among them have the power
of excommunication in their hands, that is not to follow this rule of Christ,
but to show their subjection to Antichrist: If to that parish whereof the party
is a member (as for example, let us suppose the best among them, as Blackfryers
or Mary Overyes in London, or Ashby de la zouch in Lepcester shire, or Maldon
in Essex, or Coventry in warwick shire, or any other) alas what are they the
nearer? Though they would, yet in their constitution can they do nothing, but
either go themselves or bid the other go and complain to the Lordbishop their
Ordinary, or to his Chauncelor or Archdeacon, who have the government of the
Church committed unto them. Or if they should offer to proceed other wise to
excommunication of the party, they are so far from having power to do it, as
neither were such a one by the Law of their Church to be accounted
excommunicate, and they also whosoever should attempt so to do, were subject
for this cause to be excommunicate themselves, yea and to be imprisoned and
further punished by their Lords the Prelates. Lo here how these assemblyes
(even the best of them) in their constitution can not practice Mat. 18. 15. 16.
17.
this rule of Christ, which he has given unto, and may be practiced by, every
true Church of his. The Lord give them eyes to see it, and hearts to depart
from the tents of such ungodliness.

Thus having showed that there is no more strength of proof in this third
exception, then was in the former: I might proceed to that which follows in
his letter, save that a few things which he has here inserted by the way, seem
needful first to be to wched. As first, where speaking of us, he terms a
Church set in the order of Christ to be private members. Towching which this I
thought to note, that a company of faithful people (though considered apart by
themselves they be private men, yet) being gathered together in the Name of
Christ, and joined together in fellowship of his Gospel, they are a 1. Cor. 12
27. Roma. 12 5. Hebr. 12. 22. 28. Mat. 5. 14. and 18. 17. 20. 1. Cor. 1. 2. and
5. 4. Phil. 1. 1. 5. Act. 2. 41. 42 47. and 17. 4
publik body, a Church, a city, a kingdom, and that of Jesus Christ, who is
present among them to guide bless and confirm what they do on earth in his
Name and by his power. So that like as in a City, the citizens considered
apart are commonly private members, yet jointly together are the corporation
and publik body of that town: so is it also in the Church of Christ, whether it
consist of mo or of fewer, yea though they be but Mat. 18. 19. 20.
two or three: so as they be joined together in communion of the Gospel, and
gathered together in the Name of Jesus Christ, as before is said.

Secondly, where he accounts themselves a true Church, having many famous
assemblyes, and to be proceeded against by the rule of Christ, Mat. 18. I have
already answered and showed that first he must prove their assemblyes to be
set in the way of Christ, before these sayings can be verifyed of them, or
applied to them. Many there are in deed among them famous for their gifts,
learning, wisdom, sobriery etc. but they also stand subject to the same
Antichristian disorder and confusion that the rest do. Neither doubt I but in
the most popish assemblyes there be also many famous for their gifts and
otherwise: which yet can no way justify their Antichristian estate. The Lord in
mercy grant, that such as belong to him, may bring themselves and their gifts
unto Zion for the help and beauty thereof: and no more employ them (as they
have done) to the adorning of Babel, that whore and strumpett appointed to
destruction, with all her ordinances and constitutions wheresoever.

Thirdly where he says, there be many of the Ministers in England that are not
yet in their judgment persuaded of the discipline: I ask, whether he think not
also there be many of the Ministers in Rome, Spain, and else where, that
likewise are not in their judgment persuaded of sundry other most excellent
doctrines of the Gospel? And whether therefore all other that see them, must
stay from acknowledging and observing them, until such also be persuaded of
them. If John wickleff, William Swinderby, Walter Brute, John Claydon, Martin
Luther, John Hus, Jerome of Prage, William Tyndall, John Frith, Robert Barnes,
John Rogers, Hugh Latymer, John Bradford, Rowland Taylour, John Philpott, and
other the faithful servants and Martyrs of Jesus Christ, should in their
several ages have stayed from obeying the Gospel, so far as God revealed unto
them out of his word, upon this and such like pretenses of the ignorance and
error of others: I would know, whether in so doing they had been faithful to
God, as they ought. But besides these, I would also ask, whether it might not
with as great color (if not greater in some respect) have been said to the
Apostles and Primitive Churches, that the Priests and Levites of the Jews were
not persuaded in judgment that Jesus was the Christ? To conclude, is it not
strange that in so great alight, they should still labor with such, fig
tree leaves to cover the nakedness of their filthy abominations?

The next exception he takes (when he says, that other of their ministers do
yield unto the discipline in judgment, and desire heartily the establishment of
it and the removal of all corruptions, yet cannot see how they may with a good
conscience forsake the callings and rooms they occupy, for the want of the
discipline) This exception, I say, which also might be alleged for the
papists, is of like nature with the former: or rather much worse, inasmuch as
he grants they yield to the truth in judgment, and deny it in practice. They
know (by his grant) that Christ has appointed an order of Ministry and
government to his Church, for the administration of his holy things and for
keeping his people in the obedience of faith, with commaundment to observe it to
the end of the world (for this they In all their treat^ses of this arg^m^^^.
do and must understand by the discipline): Yet in their practice they yield
not unto it: for himself says here, they want it. And not that only, but they
submitt also to another ministry worship and government (here called their
corruptions): Which seeing it ca^ not be Christ's, which they want, whose can it
be but the Romish Antichrists, with whose cup of abominations this land as the
other nations of the earth has been made drunck? God give them in time to make
conscience of retayning such Antichristian callings and rooms, that they may
cast of their Zech. 13 4. 5. Rev. 9. 3. 7. and 18. 4. 5. 6 11.
rough garments and false offices, wherein they have so long time deceyved the
people, and may thoroughly see and consider in their hearts how wittingly they
stand in disobedience against Christ: whiles he grants they want that holy
order of ministry and government (here called the discipline) which Christ
has 1. Tim. 6. 13. 14. Mat. 28. 20.
straightly charged to be kept inviolable until his appearing, and whilst they
think there shall be Ier. 51. 26
taken from Babel a stone for a corner or for a foundation in Zion. Whether
this now be a sin of ignorance in them, let themselves examine. Yet if it
were, they must remember that even that Luke 12. 47. 48.
servant that knows not his masters will, and yet commits things worthy of
stripes, shall be beat: though in deed with fewer ^^^pes then he which knows
it, and prepares not himself neither does according thereunto. Let them
therefore look to it and take heed they neither I^r. 9. 6.
refuse knowledge, nor forgett 2. Pet. 1. 5. 6. Ioh. 13. 17.
with knowledge to join obedience: least in the end they feel that which is 2.
These. 2. 8.
written, that God will render vengeance both to them that know him not, and
to such as obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Fourthly where he excepteth, that they havve not ben censured by other
Churches, and therefore are not thus to be refused: besides that which has been
answered before towching their Antichristian estate, in respect whereof they
are to be departed from without any other censuring: Besides this (I say) I
would know, by what Churches the assemblyes in Rome, Germany, France, and
England were censured, when Arnoldus de villa nova, Jerome of Prage, Martin
Luther, John Calvin, William Tyndall, the Baldenses, and the Bohemians, with
many other the servants of God in former ages left and forsook them? Or whether
they should still have remained in Babylon, till by some Churches she had been
censured? Yea, and how there could ever be a true visible Church again upon
the earth after the general apostasy wherein all nations were made drunken
with Babels cup, if the people of God should not at his Rev* 18. 4
commaundment depart out of Babylon, without staying till there were some
Churches to lay open her abominations before her face and to censure her for
them. Every Ier. 50. 8. and 51. 6. 8. 9. with Rev. 18 4. 5.
one of Gods people ought in such case and estate to deliver their own soul,
and to be as an hee-goat before the rest, to lead them the way out of Babel. So
far ought we to be from bringing balm to cure her, or abiding in her under any
pretense: least if we should still take part in her sins, we should in the
end drinck also of the cup of her sorrows. When 1* King. 19. 9. 10.
Israel stood in defection, should Eliah have committed like transgression with
them, pretending they had not ben censured by other Churches? When (...). 8.
11. 16.
Judah stood in apostasy, should the disciples of God, among whom the Law was
sealed up, have walked in the way of the rest of the people, till by some
Churches they had been censured? Finally when 2. T^es. 2. 3. 10. 11.
Antichrist that man of sin has made depar^ure from the faith and obedience
of Christ, should the people of God beleev his lies and please themselves in
the dec^ivablenes of his unrighteousness, till he be censured by others? Suerly
the Scripture teaches, and the people of God in all ages have taken another
course: as we also must do at this day, unless we set light both of obeying Gods
commaundment which charge us to depart out of every false Church, and of
undergoing his wrath which he will power upon all that have spiritual
communion with any such. Hos. 4. 15. Amos. 4. 4. 5. 6. and 5. 5. 2 Cor. 6. 17.
Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11 and 18. 4. 5. Let them therefore either prove the
constitution of their Church to be a true one according to the Testament of
Christ, or else let them know that we must depart from the^, and every false
Church, though they had never been putt in mind by any other Churches or
Christians of their Antichristian estate.

This might suffice though there were no more to be said in this matter. But
now what will Mr H. say to the multitude of Christians in our own country that
have testified against their Antichristian constitution even to imprsonment,
banishment, and death it self? Or, because the testim^ny of our own countrymen
is little regarded with them, what will he say to the publik profession and
practice of the reformed Churches abroad, who thereby have sufficiently
advertised England and all other people so walking of their fearful estate?

And because he says here, the best reformed Churches have not only not
ce^sured the^, but also account their Church a Sister, and give her the right
hand of fellowship, it will be good in this place to consider what the publik
confession and estate of those Churches is: thereby to see whether they and the
Church of England be in deed sisters of one Mother, and joined together in the
fellowship of one faith and obedience of Christ, as Mr H. and others generally
would bear us in hand.

First therefore on the one hand, we find that the reformed Churches do (...)
of Confessions: Sect. 10. Belgic, a^tia. 28. and French, (...) 26.
hold and publikly profess that it is the part and duty of every faithful man
to separate himself according to Gods word from all those which are without
the Church, and to couple himself to the company of the faithful (whom they
describe to be such as submit themselves to the doctrine and discipline of the
Church appointed by Christ) wheresoever God has placed it: yea though the
contrary edicts of Princes and Magistrates do forbid them upon pain of death.
Now on the other hand when we look at the estate of the Church of England,
first we can not find it to consist of a company of faithful people so
separated according to the word of God and the use of the reformed Churches,
but to stand in confusion of all sorts of people, good and bad, even of the
greatest persecuters and most profane of the land, after the manner of
Antichrist and his Babylonish assemblyes: secondly we cannot see that
notwithstanding the prohibition of Princes and Magistrates, they submitt
themselves to the doctrine and discipline of the Church appointed by Christ,
but that they stand in subjection to the ministry and discipline of
Antichrist. Whereupon it follows that in this constitution they cannot justly
be deemed a Sister of the reformed Churches abroad, but of the daughters of the
great Babylon spoken of in the book of the Revelation, chap. 17.

Next, towching the Ministry and government, which Christ has given to his
Church, the reformed Churches In the same book: Section, 11. French and Belgic
confession.
believe and profess, that the true CHVRCH ought to be governed by that
regiment or discipline, which our Lord Jesus has established, to wit, so that
there be in it Pastors, Elders, and Deacons: That all true Pastors in what
place soever they be placed, have the same and aequall authority among them
selves given unto them under Jesus Christ the only head and the chief and
alone universal Bishop: And that the Ministers, Elders, and deacons ought to
be called to those their functions, and by the lawful election of the Church
to be advaunced into those rooms, earnest prayer being made unto God, and
after the order and manner which is set down unto us in the word of God. And on
the other side, In the same book: Sect. 11. Helvetia: the latter confess. Capit.
18.
towching the new ministeryes brought into the Church and devised by men, as
Patriarks, Archbishops, Suffraganes, Metropolitanes, Archpriests, Deacons,
Subdeacons, and the rest of that sort, higher and lower: towching all these
(say they) we pass not a rush, what they have been in times past, or what they
are now: the Apostles doctrine concerning Ministers suffices us. And no man
can by any right forbid us to return to the ancient constitution of the
Church of God, and rather to receyv it then the custom of man. And moreover in
the Church of Geneva they In the form of Confession of faith whereunto all
subscribe that are received to be Scholars in the University of Gaueva.
profess that they detest the Hierarchy, as a divolish confusion stablished as
it were in despire of God, and to the mocking and reproach of all Christian
religion. Thus we see what the reformed Churches profess to be their faith
judgment and practice in these things. With which if we compare the present
constitution of the ecclesiastical assemblyes of this land, wherein are not
only wanting the aforesaid true offices of Pastors, Elders, Deacons, together
with the calling and administration appointed by Christ and acknowledged by the
reformed Churches: but are also remaining the false offices and usurped
authority of Archbisho^s, Lordbishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, Commissaryes,
Parsons, ^icars, Priests, and the rest of that rabble (for which these reformed
Churches profess they pass not at all, and which they have rejected as
Antichristian) together with their popish canons and constitutions: if (I say)
we compare these together, who cannot see that the reformed Churches are in
these things so far from giving to these assemblyes the right hand of
fellowship, as they do rather with the left hand put them over to Antichrist
with whom they communicate and unto whom they belong in this behalf?

Finally, for the whole worship of God, the reformed Churches Harmony of
Confess. Sect. 1. in the Be^gick and French confessions.
profess that the whole manner of worshipping God which God requires at the
hands of the faithful, is in the written word of God most exquisitly and at
large set down: and that therefore it is not lawful for any man or Angel to
teach otherwise, to add or to detract therefrom, it being perfect and absolute
in all points and parcels thereof. So as no other vvritings of men although
never so holy, no custom, no multitude, no ma^s vvisdome, no antiquity, no
prescription of time, no personal succession, no counsels, visions, miracles,
and to conclude, no decrees, statutes, or ordinances of men, are to matched
with or opposed unto the holy Scriptures and bare truth of God: but that all
things ought to be examined and tried by the rule and square thereof. For all
men are by nature ly^rs and more vain then vanity it self. Thus do the
reformed Churches hold and profess. Whereas on the contrary in England the
manner of worship and administration, is not according to the word of God, but
according to their book of common prayer taken out of the Papists Mass book,
together with other their Canons, Articles, and Constitutions, which God has
neither himself appointed in his word nor therein given authority to any other
so to prescribe. And thus have I showed by the publik confessions and judgment
of the reformed Churches themselves, that it is far otherwise then as these men
would bear the world in hand: and that in deed the Church-assemblyes in
England in this constitution can not rightly be counted sisters of the reformed
Churches abroad, but rather daughters of Rev. 17 5.
Babylon that mother of whoredoms and abominations of the earth.

Next where Mr H. shows how a private Christian should carry himself towardan
whole Church towching corruptions, I have before spoken of that matter and
noted two manners of proceeding to be appointed by God, one toward such Churches
as be set in the order of Christ but walk in it corruptly, another toward such
as stand in the apostasy of Antichrist though with some show of holiness. This
therefore being before handled, shall not need to be repeated. By it may appear
how unsound a direction he has here prescribed: besides that what he says,
may with like color be alleged for abiding in any the most popish assemblyes
wheresoever. For might not such allege for themselves, that they mislike the
corruptions in those Churches, that they refuse to subscribe or yield consent
unto them, that by prayer and all other good means they seek the reformation
of them: Yet that being private Christians, or a fevv several assemblyes, they
may not account the Churches that are in an whole nation to be as beathens or
publicanes: and that therefore they will abide in them still? If this be a
sufficient rule, then suerly the Martyrs were deceyved in former ages, and the
godly Christians at this day in Spain, Italy, and such places, which content
not themselves with misliking and seeking redress of the corruptions in their
popish assemblyes, but refuse altogether to have any spiritual fellowship with
them, and choose rather to suffer affliction for bearing witness against them.

Secondly how can they be said to mislike the corruptions, whereunto many of
them subscribe with their hands, and all of them join in their practice? Or
how do they refuse to yield consent to the corruptions, which by word and deed
they receyv, allow, and uphold?

Thirdly where he insinuates that by prayer and other good means they seek a
reformation, I would ask, with what comfort they can come before God in
prayer, when they do not only stand subject to Antichrist (in respect whereof
their Pro. 28. 9. with Rev. 14. 9. 10. Johan. 9. 31. Psalm. 66. 18.
sacrifices of prayer must needs be abominable), but by their continual
practice seem to deal like those Jews of whom we Ier. 42. 2. 5. 6. with
verse. 20. 21.
read in Jeremy the Prophet, that by their requests they made show as if they
would know the will of God to obey it, and yet when they knew it, would not
observe it. If by other good means, he understand their suits to the
Parliament, as it is an Rev. 17. 16 1 Timothy 2. 2. 3. 2 King. 23. Cap.
happy thing and greatly to be desired that the Magistrates would abolish this
false ecclesiastical Ministry, worship, and government: so yet if they do it
not, we must notwithstanding at the Act. 2. 40 41 47. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 17.
18. Psa. 119. 113. 128.
commandment of God leave all false, wicked, and Antichristian ways, and
peaceably yield obedience to Christ in his own ordinance: though we be Mat. 5.
11 12. Luke 21. 12. 16. Rev. 13. 15. and 20 4. Romans 8. 36.
for this cause reviled, imprisoned, banished, and killed all day long, being
counted as sheep for the slaughter. 1. For in this case must always be
remembered, that Act. 4. 19. Rev. 14. 12. Mat. 22. 21.
we must obey God rather then Man: and that the commandment or permissio^ of
the Magistrate makes not the way of God any whit more lawful, but only more
free from trouble. 2. Again, if the laws of men do once enact and establish
the true ministry and ordinances of Christ, then must all be forced to submit
thereu^to, whether it were Christ's or not: So as to withold our obedience from
Christ till the Law enact it, is nothing else but to stay till we be forced by
man to the obedience of God. 3. Furthermore, what if the Magistrates would
never establish that ministry and order which Christ has appointed to his
Church: should we therefore never observe and submitt unto it? To what end then
has Christ Mat. 28. 20.
enjoined us (without any exception of the Magistrates Law) to keep whatsoever
he has commanded, to the end of the world? And why has the Apostle so 1.
Tim. 6 13. 14.
straightly charged Timothy (and in him 2 Timothy 2. 2.
all others) before God and Jesus Christ, to keep the co^maundments which he
has give^ towching the Ministry order and government of the Church, without
spot and unblameable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus? 4. To conclude
this point, if without the Magistrates allowa^ce we might not observe whatsoever
Christ has commanded, what were this else but to Iam. 2. 1.
have the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ in respect of persons? Which
Mr H. Section. 1.
before in the beginning of his leter according to the Apostles counsel
wishes in any case to be avoided. And thus much by the way towching the
obedience which all Christians are bound themselves to yield unto Christ,
leaving the general reformation of the La^d to the Magistrates to whom it
belongs.

Now to proceed, where he expounds accounting as Publicanes to be meant,
accounting them such as with whom communion may not lawfully be had in the
service of God, he seems to mistake the meaning thereof: For we Luke 18. 10.
read that the Publicane went into the Temple to pray as well as the Pha^isee:
and that the special thing wherein the Jews absteyned from company of the
Publicanes was raiher in civil ^onversation, then in spiritual worship: As
may be gathe^ed by this, that Mat. 9. 11. and 11. 19
the Pharisees blamed Christ for eating with Publicanes, and yet both
themselves Luke 18. 10.
admitted them unto the Temple, and Luke 3. 12. 13. and 7. 29.
found not any fault with John Baptist for receyving them to his Baptism,
though he bed them not leav their calling but deal faithfully in it. How well
this was done of the Jews to absteyne from the Publicanes in their civil
conversation whom they admitted to their publik worship, I stand not here to
enquyer. Only this would I show, that whereas Christ's speech (when he Mat. 18.
17.
says Let him be to thee as an heathen and publicane) is taken from the
custom and practice of the Jews, who had no Act. 21. 27. 28. 29.
spiritual fellowship with the heathen, nor Mat. 9. 11. and 11. 19
civil with the Publican^s: therefore the meaning of these words ( Let him be
to thee as a publicane) is that with such as contemn the Churches voice we
should have no familiar civil conver^ation. Which the Apostle also teaches
when he 1 Cor. 5. 9* 11.
requires that with such as are cast out of the Church we should not eat or
company together. So as then Christ's speech being taken from the costome of the
Jews which his disciples could not but know, the meaning of his words when he
said Let him be to thee as an heathen (with whom the Jews had no spiritual
communion) and as a publicane (with whom they had no civil conversation) must
needs be this, that they should neither have spiritual nor civil fellowship
with such as despising the voice of the Church (where Mat. 1^. 18. 19. 20.
Christ is present to ratify what is done according to his word) were therefore
justly put away from amongst them. This I thought good and needful to note
concerning the true meaning of Christ's words in this place both because they
are here by Mr H. some what mistaken, and others among them, namely Bilsons
treatise of the perpetual government of the Church* chap. 4.
Bilson of Winchester, to the e^d they might with any color hide the truth
from the eyes of the simple, have most absurdli and in deed very wickedly
interpreted them: as I doubt not will appear unto any that fearing God shall
compare together this explication of Christ's words which I have here noted from
the Scriptures, and Bilsons sundry expositions of them mentioned in his book:
which are such as if Christ had either in that one speech had three or four
meanings, or had sent his disciples at that time Thus does Bilson interpret
those words of Christ, M^t. 18. 17.
to the Roman Magistrates for help to reclaim one another from sin: and had
not give^ a perpetual rule to his Church (for the casting out of obstinate
sinners from among them) neither made a promise of his continual presence with
his Church, to confirm in heaven that which they should do on earth in his
Name. But this by the way.

Next after this Mr. H. affirms, and byndeth himself to prove it, that there
is nothing practiced amongst them so con^ary to the discipline, as there is
amongst us. For proof whereof having belike good store) he is content, first to
omit sundry of our practices: which it may be if he had named, he perceyveth
they would have been so many witnesses against himself and for us. Secondly he
is content likewise to omit the extreem confusion which he says is to be seen
in our best reformed assemblyes. He says it (I say) but proves it not: which
in so great an accusation should not have been omitted* specially when he
byndeth himself to make proof of that which he affirms. It may be he
perceyved also in this, that if he had noted that down which he calls extreem
confusion, it might have been found to be that holy order which Christ has set
in his Church: and therefore chose rather to omit then to express it. Yet that
the truth in this behalf may better be known, I will upon this occasion show
the order of our assemblyes wherein we walk: and then let the godly minded
judge whether it be an extreem confusion, or not.

First, according to the ordinance of Christ our assemblyes consist of (i) a
company of faithful people, called out and separated from the world and all
the false ways of Antichrist. (k) gathered and joined together in an holy
covenant and fellowship of the Gospel of Christ, by (l) voluntary publik
profession of our ^aith and purpose to live and walk together in the obedience
of Christ according to his word, to the praise and glory of his name (i) 1 Cor.
1. 2. and 5. 12. and 2 Cor. 6. 17. Rev. 18. 4. Ioh. 15. 19. and 17. 6. Act. 2.
40. and 19. 9. (k) Esa. 60. 4. Phil. 1. 5. Act. 2. 41. and 17. 4. Neh. 8. 39.
Col. 1. 2. (l) Psalm. 110. 3. 2 Cor. 9. 13. Esa. 44. 5. Neh. 10. 28. 29. Act. 2.
41. Col. 2. 5. Rom 16. 26. Mat. 18. 17. 20. 1 Cor. 10. 31. Col. 3. 15. 16. 17.

Secondly, being thus joined together we do (m) according to the appointment of
Christ by a free and voluntary election of the Church set apart from amongst
our selves, some to the (n) offices of Pastors and Teachers, for the work of
the ministry: some to be Elders for the oversight and guydance of the Church
together with the Pastors and Teachers aforesaid: and others to be Deacons, for
gathering and distributing the benevolence of the Church according to the
ability and necessity of the Saints, specially taking care that the poor sick
and needy be relieved and helped according to the Churches ability and their
several occasions and necessityes: In respect whereof we purpose, when God
shall give us such as for their years and otherwise are fit to be Widovves
and Helpers of the Church in this behalf, to design and employ them hereunto.
(m) Mat. 28. 20. Heb. 5. 4. Act. 6. 3. 5. and 14. 23. and 15. 22. 2 Cor. 8. 19.
1 Timothy 3. 10. 15. and 6. 13. 14. (n) Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. Romans 12. 7. 8. and 16.
1. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Phil. 1. 1. 1 Per. 5. 1. 2. 3. Act. 6. 5. and 15. 2. and 20.
17. 28. and 21. 18. 1 Timothy 3. Cap. and 4. 14. and 5. 9. 10. 17.

Thirdly, our prayers, preaching of the word, administering of the Sacraments,
exercise of prophecy, use of the Censures etc. is not according to the
inventions, book worship, canons, or constitutions of any men whatsoever, but
only according to the Testament of Christ, as he has dealt to us the measure
of grace. Ephesians. 4. 7. 8. 11. 12. Jude, ver. 20. Rom* 8. 26. 27. and 12 6. 7. 1 Timothy 2. 1. 2. and 3. 15. 1 Cor. 4. 17. and 5. 4. and 11. 23. etc. and 14. Chap.
1 Pet. 4. 10. 11. Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17. and 28. 18. 19. 20.

Finally, we (o) all of us labor to build up one another in our most holy
faith: and when (p) any of us fall either into error in judgment, or offense in
practice, against any article of faith, commandment of God, or public good
order of the Church or Commonwealth, if the sin be private, the party is
admonished thereof by such as are privy unto (...) whom if he hear not then
taking one or two witnesses, they admonish him again and seek to draw him from
his sin: If he hear not them, as also if the sin be public, then is it
brought before the whole Church, whose voice if he despise, he is cast out from
among them: least by (q) retayning of such a little leaven should leaven the
whole lumpeeven them that are within: least also the name of God which is
called upon us should be blasphemed among them that are without: and to the and
that the sinners themselves which are thus cast out of the Church should be
ashamed and repent. Which (^) if they do, the^ is the Church again ready to
receyv them and to confirm their love to them, as before, in the Lord (o) 1
These 5. 11. Jude, ver. 20. 21. 22. 23. (p) Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17. Lev. 19. 17. 2
Cor. 13. 1* 2. Gal. 5. 12. and 6. 1. 1 Cor. 5. 4. 5. (q) 1 Cor. 5. 5. 6. Romans
2. 24. 2 These. 3. 14. 1 Timothy 1. 20. (r) 2 Cor 2. 7. 8. Mat. 18. 18. 19.

And this is that order, wherein by the mercy of God we have receyved to walk:
though we do it with much weakness, through owr own coruption that hangs so
fast upon us. Now if Mr H. or any other will needs account this to be
confusion, yet may not we therefore be likewise minded: any more then Shadrach
Meshach and Abedneg^ were when then were charged with Dan. 3. 14.
disorder because they kept the way of God and would not fall down before the
Idol of Nebuchadnezar: but we must rather with the Apostle Col. 2. 5.
rejoice, beholding such an order and steadfast faith in Christ. Yet do I not
deny, but there have been and still may be among us many hypocrites, ungodly men
creping in under pretense of religion. This has been the lot and estate of the
Church of God in all ages: as upon other occasion has been declared Page 57. 58.
before. And if it were not so, what use should there be of that power and of
those rules which Christ has given to his Church for the casting out of such
from among them, when they burst out into manifest ungodliness. Therefore are we
not to look, that the Church shall wholly be free from such, whiles it is upon
earth. Only this, howsoever with glosing words and shows such hide themselves
from the knowledge of men, yet Ie^. 17. 9. 10. Mat. 13. 40. 41.
God knows their hearts and ways, and in his day will cast them all out of
his kingdom: In the mean time, Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17. Gal. 5. 12. 1 Timothy 1. 19.
20. 1 Cor. 5. Chap.
Whenever the impiety of any such is discovered and certainly known, the
Church has power and is to use it for the purging of such leaven from among
them, that they may be an holy people to the Lord. And this still is order, not
confusion in the Church.

Now here on the other side might I put Mr. H. in mind of the extreem confusion
which is to be seen in their assemblyes: in their constrayning of all though
never so wicked, together with their seed, to stand members of their Church: in
their false Antichristian ministry of Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons,
Priests, Parsons, Uicars, and the rest of that crew: in their stinted popish
Leyturgy, according to which they offer up their prayers, administer their
Sacraments, vi^it the sick, bury the dead, marry etc. in their ordering also
and making of priests and deacons, together with their degradations
suspensions, excommunications, absolutions, dispensations, licenses to marry
without the parents consent: and all these by the Prelates, according to their
popish canons and pontifical: with infinite other such like confusions. But it
may be (with the Papists out of whose cup these were drawn) they take them to
be an heave^ly order, Yet the Scripture witnesses they are no other but the
Rev. 17. 4. 5. with Genesis 11. 9.
abominations of Babel, that is, of confusion: And so the Church of Geneva In
the form of Confession of faith whereunto all subscribe that are receyved to
be scholars in the Vniversyt of Gen^va.
professes that they detest the whole order of papistry called the Hierarchy
as a divelish confusion. These things whenever Mr. H. shall duly consider and
examine by the Scriptures he shall find true among themselves that which
untruly he obiecteth against us, that extreme confusion is to be seen in their
best reformed assemblyes.

His third and main proof whereby he would show that nothing is practiced
among them so contrary to the discipline as there is amongst us, he says, is
that which has been already mentioned: and of this he says also, it may
suffice, thinking belike that it is a very sound proof. Which whether it be so,
I leave to every indifferent reader to judge by that which has been already
answered to whatsoever he has before mentioned. And of Mr. H. himself I
desire either yielding to the truth, or sounder proof of the accusations he
charge us withal.

After this, he laboreth to prove that we should account them brethren and a
true Church, by the example of Peter who called those jews, that had
crucified Christ, brethren, Act. ^. 29 and 3. 17. and of Paul who accounted
the Galatians a true Church, when the errors they were fallen into were in
matters fundamental, Gal. 1. 2. and 5. 2. But Mr. H. should have considered,
for the first, that Peter might call the jews his brethren, as Paul does, for
that they were his kinsmen according to the flesh, Romans 9. 3. and children of
the generation of Abraham, Act. 13. 26. Secondly, because the Romans 9. 4. Act.
3. 25. and 13. 14. 15. 32. 33. Luke 1. 8. 9. and 2. 31. etc Mat. 8. 4. with
Levit. the whole book.
Jews were the Church and people of God unto whom the covena^ts and promises
belonged, who also were set in that order of ministry, worship, and
ministration which God prescribed. In respect whereof Peter was to account them
as brethren, till Act. 2. 40. and 13. 46. and 19. 9.
they had wilfully rejected the Gospel of Christ, whom Act. 3. 17. and 13. 27.
through ignorance they put to death. But what is this to prove that Christians
should account such for brethren as stand in 2 Thel. 2 3. 10. Rev. 17 ^. 2.
apostasy from the way of Jesus Christ, and in respect thereof be children of
the fornications of Babylon? Or wh^ should not John Wickleff, Martin Luther and
the rest in former ages by this reason have accounted the Papists as brethren,
till they had been convinced and rejected by the judgment of the Church.

For the second, that is, Paul's accounting of the Galatians to be a true Church
notvvithstanding some of them erred in matters that were fundamental: Mr H.
should also have remembered, first that it was but some of them that did so
err, and not the whole Church: secondly, that they were a Church established
in the order of Christ, howsoever walking therein, some of them declyned and
fell into heinous errors. So as now in regard of the ordinance of Christ
wherein they stood, they were to be accounted a true Church, and first to be
admonished and convinced before they could be rejected: as already has been
showed at large. But how does this prove, the assemblyes which stand in
Antichristian defection should likewise be accounted true Churches, and
admonished and ce^sured by others before any may forsake them? Is there not a
See for this that which is said in the beginning to the answer to this third
sectio^. Page 61. 62.
diverse account to be made, and a diverse manner of carriage and proceeding to be
used toward the Churches of Christ falling into corruptions, and toward the
assemblyes of Antichrist standing in defection from the way of Christ? Because
the Churches of Christ are to be admonished and redress of their ^ormityes
duly to be sought, must therefore the Synagogues of Antichrist make claim to
the same privileges and manner of proceeding? Or because the members of true
Churches are to be accounted brethren, till having wilfully refused to repent,
they either be cast out, or having leavened the whole lump, the candelstick be
removed from them all: must therefore the members of Antichristian assemblyes
be had in the same account, who never yet were joined to any true visible
Church in fellowship of the Gospel, but stand in confusion with the world and
subjection to the Beast, howsoever in such estate they teach and profess some
points of the truth and Christian religion? Then sure let the Papists also be
accounted brethren, and no longer the Rev. 1^. 5. with Hos. 2. 2. 4.
children of the whores fornications. But to conclude, did not the Apostle in
that epistle to the Galatians Gal. 5. 1. with 1. 8. 9. and 5. 12. and 6. 12.
charge them to stand fast in their liberty and not to be entangled again with
the yoke of bondage, but to abhor all such and count them accursed who should
preach or lead them otherwise, then he had preached and they had receyved,
towching their liberty and freedom by the Gospel from the ceremonies of the
Law? Now if they must abhor and (...) of all such as would bring in again
the abolished ceremonies of the Law, which once were commanded* by God: how
should such be accounted as brethren which retain and enforce the ordinances
of Antichrist, never appointed by God but invented by Satan that Prince of the
children of disobedience?

That which Mr. H. next obiecteth about the handling of the controversy in the
Church of Antiochea, hoth the same answer with the former. Only where he
says, that the errors in that Church were far greater then any be in theyrs,
let him well consider with himself whether the error of urging and receyving
circumcision and other ceremonies of the Law (before time the holy ordinances
of God, and now but newly abolished) was greater then the urging and receyving
of the Apostasy of Antichrist (that great enemy of Jesus Christ) in his
ministry, worship, and government of the Church, which is such as God never
ordained but Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11. and 16. 10. 11 and 17. 1. etc.
straightly forbids upon pain of eternal condemnation.

Lastly for our separation from them (which he so earnestly obiecteth against
us, and contrary to Deuteronomy. 30. 13. 14.
GOds word sends us beyond the sea to enguyre his will ther^about) we have
not only, if need were, that which he so much requires, the approbation of
the reformed Churches of Geneva, France, Belgia, Helvetia, and the rest, as
Page 67. 68. 69.
before has been showed by their own public confessions: but we have also that
which is much more and which alone were sufficient, I mean, the warrant of the
Scriptures, and the like practice of the Churches and people of God in all
ages: first Genesis 6. 2 and 4. 26. with 2 Cor. 6. 17. 18.
before the stood: and then after the flood, both in the Levit. 20 24. 25. 26.
Ezra. 6. 21.
time of the Law; and afterward under the Gospel: and that also first in the
Act. 2. 40. 41. and 19. 9. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18.
Primative Churches planted by the Apostles themselves, and now again in all
the Churches and people which since the apostasy of the man of sin have made
departure out of the spiritual Babylon, as it is Rev. 18. 4 and 14. 9. 10 11.
with 2 These. 2. 3. 4. 8.
written, Go out of her my people, that ye be not partakers in her sins, and
that ye receyv not of her plagues. Now therefore (to omit Mr H. his
unseasonable use of Paul's reproof in this place) may not we well say of these
things, as the Apostle 1 Cor. 14. 37. 38.
does to the Corinthians in the words immediately following those which are
here used, If any man think himself to be a Prophet or spiritual, let him
acknowledge that these things are the commandments of the Lord: And if any
beignorant, let him beignorant.

And thus much in defense of the first part of the reason, which was this,
Whosoever he be that deals with the holy things of God, and works upon the
consciences of men, by virtue of an Antichristian power office and calling, him
the people of God ought not to receyv or joy^e themselves unto: or as M* H.
has here set it down to like effect, he is an Antichristian minister,
whatsoever truth he brings with him. Now it remains likewise to defend the
second part of the reason, which was this, But all the ministers that stand
over the Churchassemblyes in England, deal with the holy things of God, and
work upon men's consciences, by virtue of an Antichristian power office and
calling. Concerning which, and the proof thereof, first let us see how Mr. H.
sets them down and answers unto them generally: then let us come to the
particulars, by which he endevoreth to approve their office and calling of
ministry from the word of God. It follows therefore in his letter, thus.

Mr. H. his letter* Section, 6.
THe second part of the reason is this, But all the ministers in England work
upon the consciences of men by virtue of an Antichristian office and calling.
How is this proved? First, they have no other office in the Church then that
which the laws of the land allow: and they allow none but the Prela^p,
Priesthood, and ^eaconry, which are all Antichristian offices. Secondly* they
all enter upon their office, by the Ordinary the Bishop, whose office is also
Antichristian.

To the first of these reasons I answer, that although the name of Priests
belong not to the true ministers of the Gospel, because it has been generally
in our language given to the popish Sacrificers: and although there be sundry
circumstances and ceremonies appointed by the law to be used at they
ordination which I cannot justify, and many of those good orders neglected
which the Scripture prescribes in this case: yet is that office which the
laws of our land call the office of the Priesthood, the very same in
substance with the Pastors office described in the word: and the manner of
outvvard calling unto that office which the Law allows, is the very same
in substance with that which is set down in the word.

Answer to Section, 6.
THis is Mr H. his general answer to the second part of the reason: which is
needful first to be considered, before we come to the particulars which
follow, that so both the strength of the truth and the subtilty of his answer
may better appear.

First he yields (as needs he must) that they have no other office in the
Church, then that which the Laws of the land allow: For this is alleged in
the proof of the second part of the reason, and is not at all gaynesayed by
him. Yet most of them which are of the better sort among them, when they are
somewhat pressed about their ministry, disclayme their offices and callings
receyved from and by the Prelates (which only are allowed by the Laws of the
land) and fly to I know not what office and calling receyved from some of their
forward Ministers and people: as himself also does in this his writing Section,
10
afterward, where he says, that many ministers in the land have, and all may,
if they will have, these substantial parts of a true calling, examination of
their gifts by the godly and learned, choice of the people, and a right
ordination: for I would ask, why he says many (and not all the) Ministers in
the Land have these, if it be not because he would fly from the calling by the
Prelates to that other devised calling by their Ministers and people. Otherwise
if he affirm these things, of the calling and ordination by the Prelates, then
all (and not only many) of their Ministers have and must have it, seeing the
laws of the Land allow no other: And then also should he have showed these
particulars to be had in that calling of the Prelates: which cannot be done, as
will more appear hereafter. Thus is he driven to fight not only against other
of his fellows, but even against himself, whilst he fights against the
truth: for which I am sorry on his behalf.

Secondly, it is to be noted that he yields (as also needs he must) that the
laws of the land allow no other office in the Church but the Prelacy,
Priesthood, and Deaconry: of which it was and is still affirmed, that they are
all Antichristian offices. Which if he would have taken away, then should he
have proved that they are not such, but are by Christ in his Testament
appointed to his Church. But seeing this neither is neither can be avowched by
the word of GOD, we must needs account of them as they be in deed, even the
brood of Antichrist, never known nor heard of in the Church of Jesus Christ.

Thirdly, it is to be observed that whereas their Prelacy, Priesthood and
Deaconry were all and every of them charged to be Antichristian: he speaks
only in behalf of their Priesthood, and helps not the Prelacy or Deaconry at
all no not so much as with any show of defense, but leaves them on the plain
field to shift for themselves as well as they may. It seems their cause is
very bad, that is so quite forsaken when it is so deeply charged, and that
fyndeth no succor at his hands who has himself be^ Deacon after their manner,
and receyved from that (Prelacy which thus he forsakes) that office of
Priesthood which yet he retayneth.

Fourthly, it can but seem strange that he should by this means grant the
Prelacy and Deconry to be Antichristian, and yet plead for the Priesthood, as
if it were not of the same nature: when as it is no other office but such as is
derived from the Prelacy, and whereunto their Deaconry is a step. As if we
could Job. 14. 4.
bring a clean thing out of filthynes? Or as if we could Mat. 7. 16.
gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Either therefore (as Christ
Man. 12. ^
said) make the tree good and his fruit good, or else make the tree evil and
his fruit evil. Either let them prove their Prelacy and Deaconry to be good
according to the Testament of Christ, or else they cannot plead for the
Priesthood which arises from them: Or if they confess the Prelacy and
Deaconry to be evil and Antichristian, then must they also acknowledge the same
of the priesthood which yssueth from them.

Fifthly, it is to be marked likewise, that Mr. H. grants the name of Priests
does not belong to the true Ministers of the Gospel. whereupon I would ask,
whether the office of Priests belong unto them any more then the name. If he
answer, no, as in deed he must: then will follow, that seeing neither the Name
nor office of Priests belongs to the true Ministers of the Gospel, and yet
himself with the rest of them all have the name and office of Priests, and by
virtue thereof preach and administer the Sacraments, therefore they are not
true Ministers of the Gospel. Now whereas he assigns this to be the reason
why the name of Priests belongs not to the Ministers of the Gospel, because
it has been generally in our language given to the popish sacrificers: this
seems not to be the reason, but rather these which follow: First, because Heb.
7. 11 etc.
the Leviticall priesthood being ceased, Christ has not now instituted any
office of Priests for ministry unto his Church, but remains himself a priest
for ever after the order of. Mel^hisedec, having a priesthood that can not
pass from one unto another. Secondly, because in all the New Testament it is
not read that the name of Priest does note out any of those offices which
Christ has instituted for the instruction and government of his Church under
the Gospel. Otherwise if Christ had either ordained an office of Priests for
the ministry of his Gospel, or if the name Priest were used in the new
Testament to note out the Ministers of Christ under the Gospel: it were no
sufficient cause why the name might and ought not still belong unto them,
because it has been generally in our language given to the popish sacrificers.
The name of Bisshops, Deacons, Baptism, Eu^harist, Excommunication, and such
like have been and are generally in our language given to the false offices,
sacraments, and censures of the Church of Antichrist: Yet do they
notwithstanding belong to the true offices, Sacraments, and censures of the
Church of Christ: Even as in the time of the Law the name of Priests, Altars,
sacrifices, feasts, and such like did still belong unto and were retained in
the true Church of the Jews, notwithstanding 1 King. 12. 31. 32. 33. 2 Chronicles.
1^. 9. 10. Amos. 4. 4 5 and ^. 10. (...)
those names were generally in their language given at that time to the
Priests, Altars, sacrifices, and feasts of the Heathen, and of Israel also in
her defection. But the case stands otherwise now for attributing the name of
Priests to the Ministers of the Gospel: as has been showed before, and is
again upon other occasion more to be towched hereafter.

Sixthly, it is here to be noted that he says there be sundry circumstances and
ceremonies appointed by the Law to be used at their ordination of Priests
which he cannot justify, Yea and that many of those good orders be neglected
which the Scripture prescribes in this case: and yet both Section. 10.
afterward toward the end of his writing he confesses he^ sought and receyved
his calling from the Prelates, and Section, 3. Page 17.
before in the answer of the first part of the reason he acknowledged that the
least part of Christ's ordinances cannot be neglected without grievous sin.
Now lay together these things, which this writing of his and their continual
practice witnesses of themselves: and then see in what woeful case they stand,
and mourn for their misery. Their sin is grievous in their own eyes, yet by
their own confession they do wittingly seek after it and persist in it. They
know aforehand that the Prelates ordering them will commit grievous sin and
so provoke the Lords wrath, yet do they seek to be ordained by them, and plead
in defense thereof what they can. Is not this to Esa. 6. 9. 10.
have eyes, and not to see? or (to make the best of it) is it not Romans 3. 8.
to do evil, that good may come thereon? of whom the Apostle says, the
damnation of such is just. Suerly the Tit. 11. 12. with Ephesians. 5. 11.
grace that brings salvation teaches otherwise, even to deny all ungodliness,
and not to have any fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but to
reprove them rather. So the Apostle 1 Timothy 5. 22.
charge Timothy and in him all Ministers, to keep themselves pure and not to
communicate with other men's sins. And the Lord from heaven has Rev. 18. 4.
commanded all his servants to go out of Babylon, and not to partake in her
sins, that they receyv not of her plagues. Howsoever therefore Mr. H. and the
rest of them account of this their dealing, sure we are that before GOd it is
grievous transgression: and therefore to be shunned of all such as have care to
keep faith and a good conscience, and the contrary to be witnessed in testimony
of the truth of Jesus Christ whose servants we are.

Finally, it is here to be observed how they would bear the world in hand,
that they fail but in circumstances and ceremonies, not in the substance, of
the ministry. Where we may first consider, how these forward preachers are now
driven to the same shift, whereunto they drove the Prelates and Formalists
heretofore. The Admon. to Parl. T. C. his replies.
forward preachers proved this Ministry and worship to be Antichristian: The
VVhitg. B^idges. Some etc.
Prelates and their Proctors pleaded that they failed but in circumstance, and
not in substance. Secondly it is to be noted how they would under the name of
ceremonies and circumstances subtly hide that foul heap of abominations,
which they have taken out of the whores cup of Babylon: many particulars
whereof have Page 19. 30. 77.
before diverse times ben handled, and therefore need not here again be
mentioned. Thirdly, if it were so that they failed but in circumstances and
ceremonies, yet they should remember that the Levit. 10 1. 2. 1 Chro^. 13. 9.
10.
judgment of God overtook Nadab, Abihu, Uzziah and others recorded in the
Scripture, for transgressing in matters of ceremony and circumstance. And what
privilege have they now above others to stand in known and grievous sin
against the Lord Jesus and his ordinances? Or are they 1 Cor. 1^. 22.
stronger then God, that they will thus still provoke him to anger? Fourthly,
it is to be known, and they should do well to set down, what they account the
substance of the Ministry. Mr. H. Section, 10.
afterward speaking of the entrance into the Ministry, sets down three
substantial parts thereof, as he calls them: first a due trial: secondly,
the choice of the people (it seems he means a true visible Church, else he
speaks not to the purpose): thirdly, a right ordinatio^. Of which three seeing
in his own understanding (as appears afterward) he can not himself deny but
most of their Ministers want all, and all their Ministers want some (to wit,
the choice of a true visible Church, and a right ordination) it is evident by
his own grant they want the substance of a true calling to the Ministry, and
therefore fail not only in circumstance as he would pretend.

But that we may the better try out the truth in this point, I will here set
down what I take to be substantial in the ministry. And that is, first that
it be a true and lawful office of ministry which is receyved and, executed,
that is, that it be such as Christ in his Testament has given to his Church
for the work of his ministry: secondly, that there be a lawful calling and
entrance into such office as is aforesaid: thirdly, that the administration
thereof be according to the Testament of Christ. Other things there be also
which are of great weight towthing the ministry: but these three specially I
take to be such as are substantial unto it: Insomuch as none of these can be
wanting to the execution of a true ministry.

For towching the first, that is a true and lawful office prescribed by
Christ, if it might be wanting in a true ministry, to what end were it that
Christ has Ephesians. 4. 11 12. 13.
given to his Church certain and distinct offices for the work of the
ministry to the end of the world? Or how should it be true in this case, which
the Apostle 1 Cor. 12 5. 28.
says of all the offices appointed by Christ, that God has set them in his
Church: and again, that there are diver^ityes of ministeryes, but the same
Lord? Otherwise also what a wide door would be opened to the Tim. 4. 3. with
Exodus 20. 4. 5. Number. 15. 39.
receyving and executing in the Church of any false offices whatsoever, even
for men after their own lusts to get them an heap of teachers, and so to go a
whoring after their own inventio^s in the worship of God? Finally, how should
men for conscience sake 1 These. 5. 12. 13. Heb 13. 17.
honor obey and submitt unto them which have the oversight of the Church, if
they be not over them in the Lord and consequently in true and lawful offices
ordained by Christ?

For the second, that is a true and lavvfull calling and entrance into their
office, if it might be wanting in a true ministry, why says the Heb. 5. 4. 5.
Scripture, No man takes this honor unto himself but ^e that is called of
God, as was Aaron: Yea that Christ did not attribute this honor to himself to
be made the high Priest, but was called of him that said unto him Thou art my
son, this day begat ^ thee. Why also does Christ account them for Ioh. 10. 1.
5.
stra^ngers, thieves, and robbers, which enter not in by the door into the
sheepfold, but clymbe up another way? Or to what end should it be that Christ
so earnestly Ioh. 13. 20. Luke 10. 16.
said, Verily, Verily I say unto you, If I send any, he that receyveth him
receyveth me, and he that receyveth me receyveth him that sent me: and again,
He that despises him despises me, and he that despises me despises him that
sent me. Or why has God by the Ier. 23. 21.
Prophet Jeremy complained against and rejected the false Prophets in this
respect, saying, I have not sent these Prophets, yet they ran: I have not
spoken unto them, yet they prophecy. Lastly, if a true and lawful calling were
not substantial and necessary to the execution of a true ministry, then why
might not men devise new kinds of entrance, or intrude themselves into the
ministry at their pleasure? Both which are unlawful.

For the third, that is a lavvfull administration according to the Testament of
Christ, that it also cannot be wanting the Scripture shows many times and
sundry ways. First in that the Apostle charge Timothy to 2 Timothy 1. 13.
keep the true pattern of wholesome words delivered by the Apostles: and that
if any 1 Timothy 6. 3. 5. 20. and 1. 3. 4. and 4. 7. with Gal. 1. 8. 9. Romans 16.
17. 2 Ioh. 10.
teach otherwise and condescend not to the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus
Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godlynes, they should be
separated from and holden to be accursed. Secondly, in that the Apostle says
that for 1 Timothy 3 14. 15.
this very cause he wrote unto Timothy, and in him to 2 Timothy 2. 2.
all the ministers of the Gospel in ages following, that they might know how
they ought to behave themselves in the house of God which is the Church of the
living God the pillar and ground of truth. And hereupon therefore gives most 1 Timothy 5. 21. and 6. 13. 14. 15. 10.
strait charge before God and the Lord I Esus Christ and the elect Angels, to
keep that commaundment without spott and blameles until the appearing of our
Lord Jesus. Thirdly, in that he teaches that even 2 Timothy ^ 16. 17.
to this end the whole Scripture is given by inspiration and is profitable to
teach to improve to correct and to instruct in righteousness, that the man of
God may be absolute being fully furnished to every good work. Fourthly, in that
the Apostles themselves did account it substantial and of necessity in their 2
Pet. ^. 16. 1 Cor. 11 23. Gal. 1. 10 11. 12.
own administration, not to follow subtle and cunning fables, but to deliver
that they receyved of the Lord: Neither to 2 Cor. 1. 24.
have dominion over the Saints, but to be helpers of their joy. Even as Peter
likewise 1 Pet. 4. 11. and 5. 1* 2. 3.
requires of all others, that they speak the words of God, and that they feed
the flock which depends upon them caring for it not by constraint but
willingly* not for filthy lu^re but of a ready mind, not as though they were
Lords over Gods heritage but as ensamples to the flock. Fifthly, Christ himself
the Lord of his Church has taught this both by practice and commandment. By
his practice, when concerning his own ministration he Ioh. 1^. 49. 50.
says, I have not spoken of my self, but the Father which sent me gave me a
commandment what I should say and what I should speak: and I know that his
commandment is life everlasting: the things therefore that I speak, I speak
so as the Father said unto me. By commandment, when he Mat. 2^. 20.
charged his Apostles they should teach to observe whatsoever he had commanded
them, promising to be with such unto the end of the world. And finally, if it
might be otherwise, what end would there be in the Church of Esa. 29. 13. Man.
15. 9 ^ev. 10. 1. 2. Col. 2. 18. 22. 23.
men's precepts, vain inventions, new ministrations, false doctrines, strange
worship, voluntary Religions, counterfett holiness, usurped tyranny,
Antichris^ian Lordlynes, and such like?

Thus then appears that in a true and lawful ministry it is substantial
and necessary, there be first a true and lawful office, that is, such as
Christ has in his Testament given to his Church: secondly, a lawful calling
and entrance thereunto: thirdly, a lawful administration thereof according to
the said Testament of Jesus Christ. So as to prove that they have the substance
of a true ministry, Mr. H. should have showed out of the Scripture, their
offices, entrance, and administration: their offices (I say) of Archbishops,
Lordbishops, Deanes, Prebendaryes, Archdeacons, Parsons, Uicars, Stipendaryes,
and all other sorts of Priests and Deacons among them: their entrance likewise
by the Lordbishops, according to their popish pontifical, that is, according
to their book of co^secrating Archbishops and Bishops and of ordering Priests
and Deacons, together with their Patrones presentations, their institutions,
inductions, oaths of Canonical obedience to the Prelates, and such like:
finally, their administration of the word, Sacraments, and Censures, by virtue
of the offices before said, and according to their popish book, canons, and
constitutions, together with the performance of such actions as belong not at
all to the duties of the ministry, such as be the Churching of women, the
solemnization of marriage, praying over the dead at burial, and the like. These
(I say) he should have showed by the Scriptures, if he would prove unto us that
they have the substance of the ministry of the Gospel. Which because it
neither is neither ca^ be done by the word of God: therefore can we in no wise
be persuaded that they have the substance of a true ministry and fail but in
circumstance, as he would here bear us in hand. Yet because he pretends as
if he could prove that which he says, let us see what stuff he brings to
this purpose. It follows therefore in his writing for proof of his former
assertion, in this wise.

Mr. H. his letter: Section, 7.
Does the word enjoin the Minister to preach deligently? So by our (...) he
is expressly charged at his ordination to do: and forbidden to teach any thing
as required of necessity unto salvation, but that which he is persuaded may
be concluded and proved by the Scripture: Yea it commands him with all
faithful diligence to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange
doctrines that are contrary to Gods word. Does the word authorize him to
administer the Sacraments? So does our Law. Does the word requier that the
minister should not only publikly teach, but also oversee and look to the
peoples conversation, exhorting, admonishing, reproving, and comforting them
asvvell privately as publikly? Even so does our Law. Lastly, does the word
authorize the minister to execute the censures and discipline of Christ? Our
law does also command the same. So that (although many to whom the execution
of these things appertain do grievously fail in the practice thereof, yet you
see) the office which the Law inioyneth to the Minister, is the same in
substance with that which the word lays upon him.

Answer to Section, 7.
THis is then Mr H. his proof, by which he would persuade us that their Priests
have the same office in substance with the Pastors appointed in the word,
because the Law of the land requires of their Priests the performance of such
things as the word of God requires of Pastors. But this is no sufficient proof.

For first, if he look into the Popes pontifical and Canons he shall find they
require also of their Priests and Bishops to preach diligently, to administer
the Sacraments, to oversee their flock, and to execute the censures and
discipline: And consequently if his reason were good, the most popish priests
and Bishops should have the same office in substance with the Pastors described
in the word. Which doubtless he will not affirm: or if he do let him take heed
least with Mr Giffard he prove himself a Schismatic from the Church of ^^ome,
from whence they have derived their ministry, and yet pretend as if they made
departure from that Church.

Secondly, he should have remembered, that distinction is to be made between an
office, and the actions or duties of an office. For it often comes to pass,
that many perform the actions of an office, who yet have not the office or
substance thereof, as he calls it. To offer incense was a duty belonging to
the Exodus 30. 7. 8. Deuteronomy. 33. 10. 2 Chronicles. 26. 18.
priesthood in the time of the Law. Corah, Dathan, Abiram, men famous in the
Congregation, ^zziah also a king, they take censers and put incense therein to
offer it to the Lord: Yet had Number* 16 40. 2 Chro. 26. 19 20. with Heb. 5 4.
they not therefore the substance of the Priests office, but were punished and
made examples to all such as should afterward attempt to do the duties of the
ministry, being not lawfully called and set in those offices which Christ
has appointed thereunto. The administration of Baptism likewise is a duty
belonging to the Mat. 28. 18. 19. Ioh. 1. 25. 26. 33. 1 Cor. 1. 14. 16. 175. 1.
and 3. 5. 6. 9. with Ephesians. 4. 11 12.
Ministry of the Gospel: Yet women in ENgland do administer it, yea and are
Book of common prayer: in Private Baptism.
by the Law allowed so to do in case of necessity (as they call it): Yet I
suppose Mr H. will not say that women therefore have the substance of the
Ministry: of whom the Scripture 1 Cor. 14* 34. 35. 1 Ti. ^. 12.
says, it is a shame for them to speak in the Church, and therefore does not
permit it unto them, but requires of them to keep silence. So far is it from
accounting or allowing them to have the substance of the Ministry, howsoever
the Laws of men allow them to perform some action^ thereof. The same may be
said of their Deacons, who Book of ordering Priests and Deacons:
by the Law are appointed also to administer Baptism, and (having a license)
to preach the word. Yet have not their Deacons therefore the substance of the
Pastors office, though they perform some of the duties thereof. By this then
is evident that his reason is of no weight to prove that their Priesthood is
the same in substance with the Pastors office, because by Law such duties are
required to be done of it, as by the word are enjoined to the other. As is
said, an office is one thing, and the actions or duties of the office another.
Besides that it seems, the Law at first supposing their Priesthood to be a
lawful office of Ministry, did therefore enjoin it those duties to be
performed thereyn: Whereas now it being found to be unlawful, and altogether
unheard of in the Churches of the Gospel, neither the injoyning nor the
executing of those duties can make it of unlawful to become lawful before God
any manner way.

3. But furthermore, does not the Law of the Land requier these same things of
their Archbishops also? And have they therefore the substance of the Pastors
office? How then will it be true which D. VVhitg Last book against T. G. page
137.
some of them hold and write, that a Bishop is superior both in office and
gifts to a Pastor? or as Defense of eccles. discipl. against Bridges. page 88.
89.
others of them have proved by diverse reasons against Bridges that Archbishops
and Lordbishops are neither Pastors nor Teachers: Nay moreover, that Admon. to
Pa^li. (...). 2.
they rob Christ's Church of lavvfull Pastors, and that these their offices be
Antichristian, Divelish, and contrary to the Scriptures? Or if the Archbisshops
have the Pastors office among them, what is become then of all the rest of the
Ministers of the Land? For by this means there should be but two Pastors in
the Land, seeing there are but two Archbishops. Or if the Lordbishops be the
Pastors, then are there but twenty four Pastors or thereabout in the Land: and
what be the offices then of their inferior Priests? Or if the inferior Priests
be the Pastors (as seems by this writing to be intended) then what office in
the Church have their Lordbishops, Archbishops, Archdeacons, and the rest of
the Clergy among them? Which is needful to be considered seeing Defense of
eccles. disc. against Bridge. page 101.
themselves have written (according as the truth is) that our Savior Christ
has appointed in the Note that the speech is not of the temporary and
extraordinary offices of Apostles, Prophets, Eva^ge lists, which are ceased:
neither of the Civil Magistracy, unto which every soul (even the Apostles,
if they were on earth, a^^ therefore much more all other whatsoever) ought to
be subiecct. Romans 13. 1. But the speech is only of ecclesiastical perso^^ and
that, only in the ordinary guydance of the Church.
ordinary guydance of the Church no office to be exercised by any one *
ecclesiastical person, greater then the office of the Pastors: and has also
made these all equal in every respect of ministry, jurisdiction, and power.
Whereas it is far otherwise in the Prelacy of their Archbischops, Lordbishops,
and the rest, having and exercising jurisdiction and power over the inferior
priesthood and ministry of the land.

Fourthly although the word of God lay the duties aforesaid upon the Pastors of
the Churches of Christ, yet it requires them not at the hands of this
Priesthood or any other false ministry whatsoever. Therefore is it not
material though the laws of all the nations under heaven should enjoin these
duties unto them: so long as the word of God (which is the word of truth and
only rule of religion) requires them not at their hand. Jesus Christ the Mat.
28. 18. 19. 20. Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 12 5. 28. 1 Timothy 3. cap. and 5. 17. and
6. 13. 14.
Lord and King of his Church, as he gave unto it the holy things of his word,
prayer, Sacraments, etc. so has he also given his own Ministers for the
administration thereof according to his Testament. At the hands of Antichrists
priesthood or any other false ministry he requires it not: But rather unto
all such he Psalm. 50. 16. 17.
says What have thou to do to declare mine ordinance, that thou should take
my covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hate to be reformed and have cast my
words behind thee? And Esa. 1. 1^.
again to such he says, Who requires these things at your hands? If Jupiters
priest (of whom we Act. 14. 13
read in the Acts of the Apostles) or if Mahumets priests now in Turkey should
by the laws of their nations be enjoined and thereupon should execute the
ministry of Gods word, Sacraments, and censures: would it follow therefore
that such priests had the substance of the Pastors office? And why then should
this priesthood of Antichrist have more privilege then those, seeing the word
of God has laid these duties no more upon it then upon the other, but has
Psalm. 119 21. 128. Re^. 9. 3. and 14. 9. 10. 11.
left them all with their followers and adhere^ts under the curse.

Fifthly, let him tell us whether by this reason of his, their ^umbe dogs,
unpreaching Ministers, substitutes, non reside^ts, and such like among them
must not be accoounted also to have the substance of the Pastors office: seeing
they have all of them one and the same priesthood, and seeing the Law at their
ordination enioyneth the same things to them all (...)*

Sixthly, where he says their Priests are enjoined at their ordination to
preach the word, administer the Sacaments, and exercise discipline: If it be
asked, by whom they are ordained hereunto, he must answer, by the Prelate a
Lordbishop or his Suffragane (for so besides their practice it is required by
the law he alleges): And then must he either bring warrant for this from the
Scripture (which can not be done) or else he is even in this respect never a
whi^^ the nearer. For (vv) if they speak not according to the Law and
Testimony, the light is not in them. But to let pass their entrance and
ordination till fitter occasion hereafter: let us in this place a little observe
their dawbing and deceitful hiding of most filthy abominatio^s under these
general terms of preaching the word, ministering the Sacraments, and executing
the censures and discipline.

Their Priests (he says) must preach the word. Well: but with what limits must
they do this? Their (...) Statutes, and Articles will tell you. They must not
speak against the Prelacy or other ministry of the Land: nor against their
book of common prayer (though it be taken on^ of the Popes portuis): nor
against their ecclesiastical courts of Arches, Facultyes, Commissary courts,
suspensions, excommunications, absolutions, degradations, or any other their
ecclesiastical procedings. And may not any popish priest (I pray you) thus
preach the word at ^ome, being hedged in with such limits and cautions? But
what if any of our English priests do from Gods word preach against any the
aforesaid abominations or the like? Will the authority of the word (which he
says they are ordained to preach) hear this out among them? No Uerily: But
they shall by their laws and Canons be suspensed, sile^^ed, deprived and
degraded by the Prelates, of whom they took and under whom they execute their
ministry. Besides that they shall be straightly imprisoned, and (if the Prelates
can) be brought within danger of their lives. Take for example the usage of
Mr. Udall, Mr Cartwright, Mr Field, Mr Wiburne, Mr Wigginton, Mr Lord, Mr King,
Mr Chark, Mr Wight, Page^t, Fen, Proudlove, Snape, and many mo of themselves,
some silenced, some deprived, some degraded, some condemned to death. That we
speak nothing here Henri Barrovv: John Grenvvood: John Penry: Elias, Coppin,
etc. The exiled English Church in the lovv Countries. The prisoners for this
cause in London ^urrey, Norwich, Bury, Bristovv Leycester, Northampton,
Sarisbury, I^chester, Gloucester, etc.
of diverse the faithful servants of Christ, who (though they were not priests
or had renounced their false calling) yet for separating from and witnessing
against the abominations aforesaid, have been some most cruelly imprisoned, some
banished, some put to death. But to leave this 2 Chro^. 24. 22. Mat* 25. 44.
45. 46.
unto God who sees and judges: we proceed to the rest that follows.

Their priests (he says) must also drive away all erroneous and strange
doctrines that are contrary to Gods word. How is it then, that by law they may
teach and maynteyne so many false doctrines contrary to the Scripture, as have been mentioned Page 10. 11. 12. 13.
before? Or how is it that they silence, imprison, banish, and kill such as
speak against and labor to drive away the erroneous and strange doctrines yet
retained among them contrary to the word of God?

Next he says their Priests are likewise authorized to administer the
Sacraments. Well: but by virtue of what calling? Is it not from the Prelates
the Lordbishops, who have no power from Christ to give such authority? Of which
more In Section 9. and 10
hereafter. How also must they administer the Sacraments? According to the
Testament of Christ? No: but accordin to their own book (for so the Law
requires) with certain stinted words for prayer, and certain for
exhortation: with Epistles and Gospels: with questions and cross to infants in
Baptism: with other then the words of Christ's institution in the Lords supper,
and with kneeling thereat as when they receyved their maker, and other the like
profanations derived from the Papists. And yet moreover the Sacraments they
administer must be given not to the faithful only and their seed (as Christ
has appointed) but to the most wicked and profane in the land, even to all
within the precinct of their parishes: (...) if 1 Cor. ^. 17.
they that are partakers of one bread were not one body? Or as if Mat. 7. 6.
holy things were to be given to dogs, and pearls to swyne: Or Exodus 1^. 45.
strangers uncircumcised were to eat of the Passover: Or the covenant of God
sacrilegiously to be violated whiles it is Man. ^. 17.
said to the open wicked (in delivering them the seals of Gods covenant) Thou
art righteous: Or as if the Ezech. 13 22.
wicked were to have their hands strenght^ed in their evil ways whilst by
this means life is promised them in their estate: Or finally, as if it were
not 1 Cor. 1^. 21.
the Table of the Lord but a table of devils, or at least that the table of the
Lord were not to be regarded (as they Mal. 1. 7.
said in Malachyes days), neither had through faith communion of the body and
blood of Christ, as the Apostles have 1 Cor. 1^. 16.
taught us.

Lastly he says their priests are required also to oversee they^ peoples
conversation, and commanded to exercise the censures and discipline of Christ.
And is it so in deed? Let him look a little better into their book of ordering
Priests (where they are thus commanded) and he shall find the words to be Book
of o^dering (...) etc.
these, the Prelate speaking to the Priest, Will you give your faithful
diligence always so to minister the doctrine and Sacraments and the discipline
of Christ, an the Lord has commanded, and as this Realm has receyved the
same, according to the commandments of God, so that you may reach the people
committed to your cure and charge, with all diligence to keep and observe the
same. Then he that is to be made Priest answers, I will do so, by the help
of the Lord. Now who sees not that these words (as this Realm has receyved
the same) do so restrain the other words thereunto annexed, as the Priests are
limited and promise no further nor otherwise to Minister the doctrine
Sacraments or discipline of Christ, but as this Realm has receyved them? And
have not the popish priests at ^^ome or wheresoever else in any age, with like
restraint, the same commandment laid upon them? Yet I trow Mr. H. will not
say, they have therefore the substance of the Pastors office. Next let us
consider more particularly how they do and must exercise the discipline. The
book shows, so as is receyved in the Realm: that is, by presentiments to the
Prelates, Commissaryes, and Chauncelours courts, by citations, procurations,
getting the Prelates or their Officals to suspend, excommunicate, absolve.
dispense, give licenses, give orders, degrade, deprive, and the like: and these
also not according to the rules of Christ's Testament, but according to their
Romish canons and constitutions.

Let him not tell us then, that it is but the failing of some in their practice
to whom the execution of these things is committed, and that otherwise they
have the substance of the Pastors office. They do but thus deceyv themselves
and their followers, whiles under those general terms of preaching the word,
administering the Sacraments and discipline (which at first carry a fair show)
they cover most filthy abominations, as has been declared: Even hereby showing
they^ constitution to be part of that 2 These. ^. 7. 9. 10.
mystery of iniquity wherein Satan covertly works in all deceyt of
unrighteousness among them that perish, because they receyv not the love of the
truth that they might be saved.

Hereunto might be added (if there needed further proof) that their priests at
their ordination promise to be subject to their Ordinary (that is, to the
Prelate of the Dioces) and other chief Ministers over them (that is, the
Archdeacon Chauncelor, Commissary etc.) and when they enter into a benefice do
moreover swear to yield canonical obedience to the Prelates: and finally do
themselves together with their people stand subject to their Archbishops,
Lordbishops, and the rest of the Antichristian offices and abominations often
before rehearsed. From all which the true Past^rs and Churches of Christ are
free. Neither do we here tell them of those many duty^s laid upon them by the
Law, as to bury the dead, to Church women, to solemnize marriage, and such like
which by Christ were never appointed for duiyes of his Ministry. Hitherto then
have we showed that their Priests have not the substance of the Pastors office
prescribed in the word, as he did pretend.

Now therefore will we proceed to that which follows, save that first I would
put him in mind of two things, which themselves have published. The one is,
that D. Bridg^^^ writing in defense of the offices of Archbishops and
Lordbishops, when he could not otherwise reliev them as he desired, flies unto
Bridges: in the first book*
this very point, that in the substance of their office they are Pastors or
Teachers in the Church. How soundly this is alleged for their Prelates or
Priests (besides that which is spoken before) let themselves and their own
writings be judges. The other is, that he would a little pawse and take view of
that themselves have published towching their Priests heretofore, for whom now
he pleads: As for example to give him a taste, they Ada^o^to Parlia. first and
2. treatise*
write that their Parsons, Vicars, Parish Priests, Stypendaryes, with the rest,
came from the Pope as out of the Trojane horses belly to the destruction of
Gods kingdom. Also, that the Church of God never knevv them: but that they are
the Prelates new creatures. Yet see how now all of a sodepne Mr. H. would
persuade us they are become Pastors, those ancient officers wh^m Christ
appointed and the Apostles planted in the Primitive Churches of old. Are these
things suitable one with another? Does not their contradiction discover it self?
And do not themselves proclayme to the world their deceytfull dawbing, their
halting, and unfaithfulness? The Lord give them to lay it to heart, and to amend.
Now to proceed, it follows in his writing, thus.

Mr. H. his letter: Section, 8.
T^ll us not then that the same name is given to our office, as to the popish
sacrificers. Do you think the worse of your self because you are called
Brovv^ists? And shall the holy office and calling which is so agreeable to the
word, be misliked because it is called a Priesthood? considering that though
it agree in name, yet it differs in nature and substance as much from the
popish priesthood as light does from darkness.

Answer to Section, 8.
YEs sure, we must tell them again and again, that they are Priests both in
name and office. But be it that they were not Priests by office, yet seeing the
very name of Priests (being applied to a Ministry of the Gospel among men) is
either a calling back of the Leviticall priestho^d (which were to deny Christ
to be come in the flesh) or else a monument and remembrance of that priesthood
of Antichrist which is odious to Christ and all good Christians: with what
conscience can they still retain or plead for so unchristian and abominable a
name? Have they forgotten or do they not regard, that among the marks of that
great whore the Romish Babylon, this is one that she is full of Rev. 17. 3
names of blasphemy? And among these names of hers, is not this of Priest
(being spoken of an office of Ministry among men under the Gospel) one of
them that is most blasphemous, for the reasons before alleged? Has not God
also threatened that they shall drink of the cup of his wrath, and have no rest
day nor might, not only which worship the beast and his image, but even Rev.
14. 11.
whosoever receyveth the print of his name? Let them therefore make as light
account hereof as they please: Yet dare not we but mislike and abhor this and
the rest of the Names of bla^phemy retained among them.

And yet to, we neither do neither need think the worse of our selves because
we are called Brownists. It is one thing to be rayled upon and miscalled by the
adversaryes of the truth: another to borrow from them and retain with them
their names of blasphemy. It is one thing to be reviled by nick^^mes and
sclaunders: another to be called by fit and proper names. It is one thing to
be falsely and unjustly termed this or that: another to be truly and justly so
termed. ^e are reviled and termed Brownists by the enemies of the truth falsely
and unjustly: therefore there is no cause why it should m^ve us. The Apostles
themselves and the Christians with them in the Pr^^itive Churches were likewise
Act. 24. ^ and 28. 2^.
called a sect of Nazarites, and every where spoken against. And at this day by
the sclaunderous papists are the names of Calvinists, Lutherans, Zwinglians,
and the like attributed to them that consent to the doctrine of truth taught by
Calvin, Luther, Zwinglius etc. God knows we hold not this truth we profess,
of Brown or any man whatsoever: but because it is the ^octrine and
commandment of Christ, revealed in his word and given to his Church. We
bless God for any instruments he uses to manifest his truth to the world: but
we 1 Cor 3. 2^.
rejoice not in men, neither their persons nor names. We are baptized into the
^ame of Christ: and are called Christians, as were Act. 11. 26.
the Disciples in the Primitive Churches. The slaund^rous names given to them
in that age, or to us or any other Disciples of Christ in this or any other age
we acknowledge not. It is the malice and subtilty of Satan and his instruments,
by such sclaunders and nicknames to make the truth and servants of God odious
and abhorred of the world. Therefore regard we (...) not: but with the Apostle
we do Act. 24. 14.
freely confess that after the way which they call Heresy so worship we God
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, beleving all things that are written in
the Law, in the Prophets and Apostles: and endevoring our selves to have always
a clear conscience toward God and toward men. Let men therefore call us
Brownists or what they please: it troubles not us, seeing we are so termed
untruly and unjustly.

But for their name of Priests, it is far otherwise. They are truly and justly
so called: and that for these causes following. First for that the Law (whereto
Mr. H. appealeth for their defense) allows no other orders of Ministry in
the land, but of Deacons (which is the way to the priesthood) and of Priests,
so made and ordained by the Prelates.

Secondly, because at their Book of ordering P^iests.
ordination, the Archdeacon presenting them to the Lordbishop uses these
words, Reverend father I present these men unto you to be admitted to the order
of Priesthood.

Thirdly, for that the Prelates, by whom they are ordained, admit them to no
other office. For after the Archdeacon has presented them as is aforesaid,
then the Prelate speaking to the people says In the same book.
thus, Good people, these be they whom we purpose God willing, to receyve this
day unto the holy office of Priesthood.

Fourthly, because their book of ordination both in the The, form and ma^er of
making and co^secrating Bishops, Priests and Deaco^s.
title of it and else where throughout the book shows they receyv no other
office: And therefore calle^h and accounts them priests. As does also their
book of common prayer, and their other books of Articles and Ini^^ctions,
almost i^ every page.

Lastly, because the most popish priests, whether they have been so made
here^ofore in England in ^. Maryes days, or else be so made at Rhemes or Rome
or any suc^ place in these da^es: yet if they renounce only those points of
popery that this land has rejected, are receyved and retained for priests
(without any new ordination) to administer in these asemblyes: to offer up
their prayers, to deliver their Sacrme^ts to them, to preach, to enter upon any
ben^fice in the land, to enjoy the commodityes thereof and to perform the
duties thereunto belonging. Proof hereof we have seen not only in ^: Mary
priests so retained from the beginning of her Maiestyes reign unto this day:
but also in diverse popish priests of this age, as Tirell, Tither, Nichols, and
such other who being made Priests at Rhemes and Rome, were (without any other
ordination then there they had, upon recantation of some popish errors,
receyved for ministers of these assemblyes and inducted into benefices by the
Prelates. Whereas on the contrary such as have been allowed for ministers in the
reformed Churches beyond seas (where the popish priesthood is wholly rejected)
when they come into England are not approved for lawful ministers to
administer in these assemblyes, neither to enter upon any their benefi^es,
unless they be first made Deacons and Priests by some of the Prelates. Proof of
this also we have seen not only in the troubles raised in this behalf against
Mr Whitting^am at Durham in the North, and against Mr Travers at the Temple in
London: but most evidently in Mr Wright (now Parson of Dinnington in Suffolck)
who being presented to that benefice, yet could not (for all the allowance he
had receyved of the reformed Churches in the low countries) be instituted and
inducted into it, till he was made Priest by Scamler Prelate of Norwich now
deceased. Thus (to omit till hereafter how near of kin our English Priests
are to the popish) by these reasons is evident that they are truly and justly
called Priests: Which is the thing that was to be showed.

But they will say, they are not ordained to sacrifice for the quick and the
dead, as be the popish priests. Whereto I might ^unswer, that some of them were
so ordained, and never receyved any other ordination: yet notwiths^anding stand
they priests of these assemblyes, at this day, as was showed In Q: Mary priests
In Tirrell, Tither, etc.
before. But be it that none of them were so ordained: What then? Does it
follow therefore they are no Priests? If so, the the Leviticall priests under
the Law were no priests. For they were not ordained to sacrifice for the quick
and dead: Yet were they priests by office of ministry, and lawfully also at
that time as the Exodus 28 1. Dent. 33. 10. vyith Le. 21. 1. Hos. 9. 4. Deuteronomy.
12. 11. 12.
Scripture teaches. Neither by this reason are Mahumets priests at this day,
or any priests of the Heathen to be accounted Priests. For they are not
ordained (as the popish priests) to offer up Christ, whom they reject: Yet are
they priests notwithstanding by their office (as we Act. 14. 13.
read of Jupiters Priest in the Acts): but false ones as be also the Romish and
English and all Antichristian priests whatsoever.

Secondly, although the Mass (whereto those popish priests be bound) be the
chief and principal, yet is it not the only abominable sacrifice and worship
in the world. To let pass the Heathens sacrifices and priesthood: what may we
think (in this light of the Gospel) of that Idoll-book of stinted prayers and
exhortations, whereto the priests of England be tied to offer it up as their
publik sacrifice and worship unto God? Will you hear what some of themselves
have thought of it, and have advertised the most honorable Court of Parliament
concerning it? Thus then have they (...) Admon. to the Parli^^* tr^atise 2.
written hereof: We must needs say as follows (these are their own words)
that this book is an vnperf^^^t book, culled and picked out of that popish
dunghill the mass book full of all abominations. Lo here* in their own
consciences their book of Common prayer is no other but a pigge of that mezeld
sow the Mass book. Yet this sacrifice do their Priests daily offer up unto God
and are bound thereunto. And that so, as among them this may and does serve
alone without any their sermons or other prayers, whereas these without it in
their constitution are not sufficient. Although then the Priests of England be
not now ordained to say Mass, neither tied to the Mass book in Latin: yet
when in stead thereof they are still bound to such a book and worship, as (by
their own confession) is culled and picked out of that popish dunghill the
Mass book full of abominations: what can this help for their defense? Nay
rather considering the light and measure of knowledge revealed more to them then
to the Papists, is not their sin (though not in it self, yet) in this respect
so much the greater, as they have receyved more light and knowledge of the truth
then the other have done?

Thirdly, neither is sacrificing the only duty of the priesthood in Popery:
but besides it they have, by virtue of their ordination to that office,
authority likewise to read their service book, to preach, to minister the
Sacraments, to bucy the dead, to solem^ize Marriage, to Church weomen after
childbirth, to pronounce absolution when they visit the sick etc. All which
being duties likewise of the Priesthood of England, whereunto in this
constitution they have authority by virtue of their ordination to that office,
as have the Priests in popery: What great matter is it, if agreing with them in
so many several duties of the same office, they should altogether differ from
them in one? The Turkish and Heathenish priests at this day, although they
differ very much both from those at Rome and these of England, yet
notwithstanding are they Priests in a false office, as well as the other.
Hitherto then has been showed that the Ministers of these assemblyes are truly
and fitly called Priests. And Master H. himself who pleads their cause, yet
cannot (you see) deny, but they agree in Name with the popish priesthood.

Now whereas he adds that though their Priesthood agree in name, yet it
differs in nature and substance as much from the popish priesthood as light
does from darkness: it is as true as when he said In Sec^on 6. and 7.
before, their priesthood was in substance the same with the office of the
Pastor described in the word: that is, it is utterly untrue. Which although it
be sufficiently proved In the answer to the 6. and 7. (...).
already, yet for more clearing of the truth and stopping of their mouths, it
shall be good here by way of comparison to set down the agreement of theyrs with
the popish priesthood on the one hand, and on the other the disagreement of
them both from the Pastors office which Christ has appointed.

1 And first of all it would be known what the cause is why they retain the
same name, if they have not the same office with the popish priesthood? As
also, if they have the same office with the Pastors described in the word, why
then they have not also the same name? In the history of Isaac the Scripture
records (as a thing very godly and memorable) that Ge^. 26. 18.
when he dug again the wels of water, which they had dug in the days of
Abraham his father, and which the Philistims had stopped after the death of
Abraham, he gave them the same names which his father had given them. If these
men likewise have recovered again the Pastors office planted by the Apostles in
the Primitive Churches, and since their death stopped up by the Romish
Philistims: why do they not in like manner give it the Ephesians. 4. 11. with 1 Cor.
4. 15
same name that our fathers the Apostles gave unto it? Are these men wiser then
the Apostles of our Lord Jesus? or are they fathers in Christ more then the
Apostles? or do they disdain to tread in the Apostles steps, as Isaac did in
Abraham's? Again, let them tell us why they keep the name of the popish
priesthood, if they have not still the same office? Have they not heard of the
promise made by the Lord to his Church and people when he brings them from
Idolatrous ways Hos. 2. 17.
that he will take away the names of Baalim out of their mouth and that they
shall no more be remembered by their names* Has the Lord said it, and shall he
not do it? or has he promised, and shall he not accomplish it? Now is it then
that these men have the same name, if they have not the same office with the
popish priesthood? Is it because they would manifest to the world, that as yet
in their estate that promise belongs not unto them? Then certainly as yet
they are not the true ministers and Churches of Christ. Or is it because they
would have all me^ know that as yet they Rev. 14. 9 11.
worship the Beast, and receive his mark and the print of his name? Then suerly
as yet they are false Ministers and Churches of Antichrist. Or finally, is it
because they can well like of the Rev. 15. 3. and 18 4.
names of blasphemy written in the whores forehead, neither are afraid to
partake in her sins? Then needs must they look to receyv also of her plagues
whose end is damnation: as the Scripture Rev. 17. 1. and 18. 4 5. and 19. 2.
witnesses. This therefore first is a matter of great weight and consequence
(howsoever they regard it) that in name they both agree with the Priests of
Antichrist, and disagree with the Pastors of Jesus Christ. But we will proceed
to compare them together in other things which themselves account of greater
moment: as in For proof of these particulars followvving, wherein the Popish
and English priests are compared together, besides their constitution and
practice (which alone were proof suf^^cient) see the Popes po^tificall and
Portuis, and compare with the^ the Inglish book of ordering Pri^^^ and
Deacons* and they^ book of Common prayer: Also their C^no^t Articles, (...)*
etc*
these which follow:

2 The office of the popish priesthood is such as before any (...) it they must
first be made Deacons by some Prelate: Such also is the office of Priesthood
receyved and used in England. But such is not the Pastors office appointed by
Christ: Ephesians. 4. 8. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 1^. 28. Act. 14. 23. Tit. 1. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.
Romans 12. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

3. The popish priests are capable of the offices of Archbishops, Lordshops,
Archdeacons, Suffraganes, Deanes, etc. retayning still their office of
priesthood withal: So are the Priests of England. But so are not Pastors whom
Christ has given to his Church. 2. Cor. 6. 15. 16. 17. Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11. 12.
Gal. 2. 18. Romans 12. 7. Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 12. 5. 18. 28.

4. The popish priests may in their constitution (notwithstanding their
ecclesiastical office) take upon them civil offices and callings (as to be
Justices of peace, County Palatyne, Lord President, Lord Chauncelor etc): and
be honored likewise, with the titles of Kings and Nobles (as Grace, Lord,
Honor, Metropolitan, Primate etc): So is it also with the Priests of England
in their constitution. But so is it not with the Pastors ordained by Christ in
his Church: Luke 12. 14. and 22. 25. 26. 1 Pet. 5. 3. Ioh. 5. 44. Romans 12. 7.
2. Tim. 2. 4.

5. The popish priests in their constitution are inferior offices to
Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons etc. So are also the Priests of England.
But so are not Pastors in the constitution and Churches of Christ. Ephesians. 4.
11. 12. Romans 12. 7. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. 1 Timothy 5. 17. Act. 14. 23. and 20. 17. 28.

6. The popish priests must be ordained to their office by a Lordbishop or his
Suffragane: So must also the Priests of England. But so may not the Pastors of
the Churches of Christ: but either by the Eldership or (at the Churches first
growing into order, when yet they have not Elders) by some of the fittest
members, in the Churches name and by the Churches authority appointed
thereunto: 1 Timothy 4. 14. Number. 8. 10.

7. The popish priests at their ordination must be presented to the Lordbishop
by an Archdeacon or his deputy, using also these words of presentation,
Reverend father, I present these men unto you to be admitted to the order of
Priesthood: So likewise must the Priests of England be presented. But so may
not the Pastors appointed by Christ: Rev. 14. 9. 11. 12. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16.
17.

8. The popish priests must be ordained to their office according to their
pontifical devised by themselves: In like manner must the priests of England be
ordained to their office according to their pontifical, that is, according to
their book of ordering Priests and Deacons, of which themselves Admo^. to Parl*
second treatise* (...) 1^.
say, It is nothing else but a thing word for word drawn out of the Popes
pontifical, wherein he shows himself to be Antichrist most lively. But so
may not any be ordained to the Pastors office: but only according to the
Testament of Christ. Ioh. 10. 1. 2. 7. Act. 14. 23. 1 Timothy 3. 10 15. and 4. 14.
Hebr. 5. 4. Rev. 22. 18. 19.

9 The popish priests at their ordination must kneel upon their knees at the
feet of the Lordbishop that ordeyneth them, and he must say unto them (though
blasphemously) Receyve the ^oly Ghost, whose sins you forgive they are
forgiven, and whose sins you retain they are retained: So must the Priests
of England likewise be ordained, humbly kneeling at the Prelates feet, and with
the same blasphemous words spoken unto them by the Prelate. But so may not the
Pas^ors of Christ be ordained. Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11. 1 Co^. 12. 4. 5. 6. 7. etc.
Ioh. 20 22. 23. Esa. 42. 8. with a These. 2. 3. 4.

10 The popish priests are not ordained in and before the Con^regatio^ where
they are to have charge and minister, but in Metropolitan or Cathredrall
citt^es, or at some of the Prelates palaces, or where else he pleases to give
orders (as they call (...)) sometimes 40. or 50. or 60. miles from the place
where they ar^ to minister: So are the Priests of England. But not the Pastors
of the Churches of Christ: For they are and must ^e ordained in the face and
presen^e of the Congregation whe^eof they are chosen Pastors. Act. 14. 23. and
6. 2. 3. 5. 6. and 1. 15. Numb. 8. 9. 10.

11 The popish priests are taken and ordained without fasting and pra^er of the
Congregation where they are to minist^^: So are the Priests of England. But
Pastors not so: Act. 14. 23. and 13. 3.

12 The popish priests taking charge of souls, are not elected by the
Congregation whereof they are to take charge, but are presented by a Patron to
the Lordbischop to be instituted and inducted into a benifice, being Deacons or
Priest before, so made by the Prelates: Thus also are the Priests of England.
Whereas contrariwise the Pastors of Christ are elected by free and voluntary
ch^yse of the Church whereof they are to be overseers. Act. 14. 23. and 6. 2.
3. 5. ^ Cor. 8. 19. Numb. 8. 9. Ezech. 33. 2.

13 The refusal of the whole parish cannot debar a popish priest from having
charge of their souls, when he is presented by the Patron and instituted by
the Prelate: Neither can (...) the Priests in the parishes of England. But so
it is not with the Pastors and Churches of Christ. Act. 14. 23. and 6. 2. 3. 5.
2 Cor. 8. 19.

14 The popish priests may at their pleasure without c^nsent of the people
re^igne or give over their benefices, and com^^nly betake themselves to some
other of greater value: So may also the Priests of England. But Paf^ors may not
give over or leav the flock over which the holy Ghost by the Churches calling
has made them overseers, except it be with consent of the Church and for such
cause as is warranted by the said holy Ghost in the written word. Act. 20. 28.
with 14. 23. Col. 4. 17. Romans 12. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. Esa. 62. 6. 7.
Ezech. 3. 26. 27. with 33. 22. Numb. 8. 25.

15. One popish priest in their constitution may and does ^ake the charge and
commodity of many parishes and benefices at once: So also may the Priests of
England. Wher^as Pastors have but one only flock depending upon them,
whereunto they must attend with all faithful diligence: 1 Petr. 5. 2. 3. Act.
14. 23. and 20. 28. Romans 12. 3 -- 7. Tit. 1. 5. 1 These. 5. 12. 13. 14. Hebr.
13. 17. Ezech. 34. Cap.

16. The popish priests wait not the Churches calling to ^he ministry, but
seek and make suite to some Prelate to be ordained Priests, giving money also
for their letters of orders: So do also the Priests of England. But so do not
Pastors: but stay till the Lord by his Church call them to that office. Hebr.
5. 4. Act. 20. 28. with 14. 23. Esa. 62. 6. 7. Ezech. 33. 2. with ler. 23. 21.
and 2 Chronicles. 13. 9.

17 The popish priests are ordained to their office though they have no flock
to attend upon: Yea commonly 20. or 30. of them are ordained at once, whereof
no one is called to any particular congregation, but they must afterward (like
masterles men) seek and sue for places where to be employed: So is it also with
the Priests of England. Whereas Pastors are always ordained to the attendance
of a certain particular Church for the work of the Ministry thereyn: Act. 14.
23. and ^0. 28. Tit. 1. 5. 1 Pe^. 5. 2. Rev. 1. 20.

18. Such be popish priests and have ^ure of souls amo^ng them as are not at
all able to preach the word: Such be also Pries^s and have charge of souls in
England. But none such be Pastors, but they only that being apt to teach are
lawfully called to that office. 1 Timothy 3. 2. Ephesians. 4. 8. 11. 12. Tit. 1. 7. 9.
Ioh. 10. 1 -- 5. Number, 1^. 5. 40.

19. Of the popish priests that can preach it is required, that besides
ordination to their office they have special li^ence from the Prelates to
preach: So is it also required of the Priests of England. But not of the
Pastors of Christ. Act. 20. 28. 1 Cor. 7. 23. and 9. 16. and 12. 5. 28. Ephesians.
4. 1^. Rev. 14. 9 -- 1^,

20 The popish priests are subject to be silenced, suspended, deprived,
degraded by the Prelates: So are also the Priests of England. But not Pastors:
Rev. 2. 1. and 14. 9. 12. 2 Timothy 4. 1 2. Esa. 62. 1 6. 7. Zach. 11. 17. Ier.
48. 10. 1 Cor. 9. 16. and 12. 28. Act. 4. 19. 20. and 20, 28.

21. The popish priests at their institution must swear to perform Canonical
obedience to the Prelates their Ordinaryes: So must the Priests of England. But
not Pastors: 1 Cor. 12. 5. 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. Rev. 2. 1. and 14. 9. 12. Act.
5. 29. 31. Ioh. 15. 14. Romans 6. 16. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16.

22. The popish priests are tied to a book of s^inted prayers and a prescript
order devised by man, for their worship and ministration: So likewise are the
Priests of England bound to a prescript order of service and book of Common
prayer taken out of the Popes portuis. Whereas the Pastors of the Churches of
Christ are free to use their gifts receyed from Christ for the work of his
Ministry, being ^yed thereyn to no inventions of men, but only to the rule
and order which Christ in his word has appointed ^herevnto: ^phes. 4. 8. 11.
12. 1 Cor. 12. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 11. Exodus 30. 9. with Psalm. 141. 2. and Rev. 8.
^ Esa. 29. 13. Mat. 15. 9. 1 Pet. 4. 10. 11. 2 Timothy 1. 6. 7. Romans 8 26. Ioh. 4.
24. ^ Tim. 3. 15. and 6. 13. 14. with Gal. 3. 15. 2 Timothy 3. 16. 17. Rev. 22.
18. 19.

23 The popish priests are bound in that office to perform such actions as
Christ never appointed for the work of his ministry, as to Church women, to
bury the dead, to solemnize marriages etc. So are the Priests of England. But so
are not Pastors Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. Romans 12. 7. 8. 1 Timothy 3. 15. and 5. 17. and 2 Timothy 3. 16 17. Rev. 22. 18. 19.

24 The popish priests be not of like and equal power degree and authority
among themselves, but are some of them inferior to other hereyn, as Parsons to
Archdeacons, Archdeacons to Lordishops, Lordbishops to Archbishops: So is it
with the Priests of England. But not with Pastors: For they have all of them
like and equal power degree and authority under Christ the only Archbishop
and great shepeard of the sheep. 1. Pet. 5. 3. 4. and 2. 25. Luke 22. 24. 25.

25 The popish priests together with their people stand subject to the
ecclesiastical courts, Canons, citations, excommunications, absolutions, and
other the like jurisdiction of the Prelates and their Officials: So stand also
the priests of England and their people. But so stand not the Pastors and
Churches of Christ: Rev. 14. 4. 9. 12. Mat. 6. 24. and 28. 20. Ioh. 3 35. 36.

26 The popish priests have joined with them in their ^har^e Churchwardens and
Sidemen which are sworn to present to the Ordinaryes court as also to his
Chauncelors and Commissaryes courts all such offenses, faults and defaults as
be committed among them against the Prelates Articles and Injunctions: So is it
also with the Priests of England. But not with the Pastors of the Churches of
Christ: Wherein they are not only freed from all Antichristian bondage, but
have also joined with them Teachers and Elders for the instruction, oversight,
and guydance of the Church according to the ordi^ances of Jesus Christ, and no
other. 1 Timothy 5. 17. and 6. 13. ^4. Romans 12. 7. 8. Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 12.

27 The popish priests with their Churchwardens and people have not the power
of Christ to cast out any from among them, neither have in this or any thing
else in their constitution the keys of the kingdom of heaven to open and shut,
to bynd and loose, to remit and retain according to the word and ordinance of
Jesus Christ: but the chief ecclesiastical power and authority among them is
in the hands of the Prelalates and their Chauncelors Archdeacons and Officials,
to be administered according to their Canons and constitutions, as before is
said: So is it also with the Priests Churchwardens and people of England. But
contrarily with the Pastors Elders and people of the Churches of Christ: Mat.

28 The popish priests must be discerned from the other people by Surplice,
tippet, square cap, etc. So must also the priests of England. But not pastors:

29 The popish priests by virtue of their ordination to that office are capable
of induction and institution to any benefice whereto they are presented, to
receyv the tithes, gleavs, chrismes, oblations, and such like maintenance
belonging thereunto: So are also the Priests of England. But so are not any by
virtue of ordination to the Pastors office: neither is the Pastors maintenance
to be by ti^hes or any other Jewish or popish manner, but only of the Gospel,
as Christ has orde^ned: 1 Cor. 9. 14 Gal. 6. 6. Romans 15. 27. 1 These. 5. 12.
13. with Heb. 7. 5. 12. Col. 2. 17.

new ministry devised by man, even the man of sin, both in the office,
entrance, administration, and maintenance thereof: Such is also the Priesthood
of England. Whereas the Pastors (p) office, (q) entrance, (r) administration,
and (s) maintenance is not any invention of man, but the appointment of Christ
set down in his word. (p) Ephesians. 4. 11. Romans 12. 8. (q) Act. 14. 23. and 6.

administration, and maintenance, as Rev. (...) 16. 1. King. 23. 5. etc. De^t.

Princes and Magistrates may and ought by their authority to abolish it out of
their dominious: Such is also the Priesthood of England in all those
particulars. But such is not the Pastors place and function: Ephesians. 4. 11. 12.

32 The popish priesthood is such in all the particulars aforesaid, as the Lord
Jesus will 2 These. 2. S. Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. and 17. 1. and 18. 20 -- 23. with
Ier, 5^. 60 -- 64. Rev 19. (...)
consume with the brightness of his appearing in the light and power of his
Gospel before his second coming: Such is also the Priesthood of England.
Whereas on the contrary the Pas^ors office and function is to continue to the
end of the world, eue^ till we all meet together in the unity of faith and
acknowledgme^t of the Son of God, to a perfitt man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ: Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 13. Romans 12. 5. 8. Heb. 12.
28. 5. 20. 1 Timothy 3. cap. and Math. 28. 17. and 6. 13. 14.

33 Finally (therefore) the popish priesthood is such as Ioh. 10. 5. Rev. 9 3.
and 14. 9. 10. 11. and 18. 4 Amo^. 4. 4. ^. and 5. 5. Number. 16. (...). 26. Man.
7. 15. Psalm. 119. 113. 128. 2 Cor. 6. 14 -- 1^.
no^e may have any spiritual communion therewith, but all ought to forsake and
depart from it, though all Princes under heaven should command the contrary:
Such is also the priesthood of England. Whereas on the other side the Pas^ors
function is such as is not to be left but to be joined unto in the service of
God, notwithstanding the prohibition of Princes or any other whomsoever to the
contrary: Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 1 Timothy 5. 17. and 6. 13. 14. 15. Romans 12. 4 -- 8. 1
Cor. 12. 5. 28. and 14. 37. Mat. 28. 20.

Hitherto then have we been both the agreement of the Priesthood of England
with the popish and how both of them disagree from the Pastors office appointed
by Chirst. Neither should we make an end, if we would com^are them together in
all things, or dilate at large these particulars afor^ said. This may suffice
to show how untrue it is which Mr. H. affirms, saying their Priesthood
differs in nature and substance as much from the popish Priesthood as light
does from darkness, and, that it is the same in su^stance with the Pastors
office described in the word. Let him that reads consider what has b^n said:
and then judge righteous judgment. Now to proceed, thus it follows in his
writing:

Mr H. his letter. Section, 9.
WE have seen how well our Law agrees with the law of God in the
substance of the Ministers office: Let us consider how like they ^e in the
ma^or of his outvvard calling unto his office. The word ^eq^ireth that he
only should be called to the Ministry, that is a man of unblameable life: If
it would please you to peruse the book of ordering Deacons and Priests, you
shall find it requires the same. The word reqaireth that he should be apt to
teach: So does our Law. The word requires that before he minister he should
be approved: Our law commands that before he be admitted, he be by such as
are learned examined what gifts he hat^ and ability to teach, and by the
people what his conversation has been. The word prescribes that the people
and flock should approve of and choose their Minister: Our Law commands
that none should be admitted to that office but in a solemn assembly, and that
liberty should be granted to any in the congregation to object whatsoever
just impediment that they shall knevv against him. The word requires that by
the imposition of the hands of the Eldership with solemn prayers, the
Minister should be ordained and as it were consecrated to that holy office:
Our law requires the very same. In deed I confess that there is great want
in our Church in the due execution of these things: but that is the fault of
the men, not of the calling. And therefore to your reason that is brought to
prove^s Antichristian usurpers, because we have no other office in the Church
but that which the Law allows, you see I may truly and suffiicienly
answer that although we had no other, yet have we that in substance which
the word prescribes.

Answer to Section, 9.
RAther by that which has been said we have seen such an agreement of their
Priesthood and Law thereof with the popish Law and priesthood, and such a
disagreement of them both from the Law of God and Pastors office prescribed
theyrin, as it can not but be discerned of all (whose eyes are not blinded)
that both the Pastors office differs as much from their priesthood as light
does from darkness, and that their Priesthood in nature and substance agrees
with the popish as daughters of one mother and feathers of one and the same wing.

Now whereas in the next place Mr H. comes to their ouward calling to that
office of Priesthood, and therein refereth us to their book of ordering Priests
and Deacons, that we might peruse and so compare together their law with the
Law of God: it is strange to see how they do themselves discover their own
shame, even when they labor most to hide it. For if any would go about to lay
open the filthynes of their abominations which in the calling to their
ministry they have taken out of the whores cup of Babylon, it can no way
better be done, then by comparing that book of theyrs (whereto he refers us)
with the book and Law of God on the one hand, and with the Popes pontifical on
the other. Evidence whereof we have seen sufficient in the comparison handled
Page 100. etc.
before, and need not repeat it. Yea their own consciences are so convinced
herein as themselves have confessed and published it (in admonition to the
Parliament) that Admo^ to Parl. 2 (...) a^ise: sect. 14.
their Pontifical (thus they call their book) whereby they conserate Bishops
and make Ministers and Deacons is nothing else but a thing word for word drawn
out of the Popes pontifical, wherein he shows himself to be Ant^christ most
lively. And moreover, that In the same book: sect. 20.
they have an Antichristian Hierarchy and popish ordering of Ministers,
strange from the word of God and the use of all well reformed Churches in the
world.

Let these things then be laid together, and well weighed. Now they would
persuade us that their calling to the Ministry is according to the Law of God:
Heretofore they published (as the truth is) that they have a popish ordering of
ministers strange from the word of God. Now they would bear us inhand that
they have the substance of a true calling according to the ordinance of Christ:
Heretofore they said (and truly) that their making of Minist^rs is taken out of
the Popes pontifical wherein he shows himself to be A^tichrist most lively.
Is it not lamenta^le to see these men thus turn the truth of God into aly? as
if Antichrists apostasy were now suddenly become Gods ordinance, or the Popes
pontifical were all one with the Testament of Jesus Christ? Besides this is it
not strange that in this very letter Mr H. should so forget and contradict
himself, as here to say their Law agrees with the Law of God as tovvching the
substance of a true calling to the Ministry: and yet (...) 10.
afterward accounting right ordination to be a substantial part of true
calling, to affirm that the power of ordination is by act of Parliament
committed to the Prelates, and that by the Law of God the Prelates are not
capable of that power and authority? Is it possible to make these things
accord together?

But because they fear not to deal thus doubly in the matters of God: Let us
(besides that which has been said) yet a little more examine their manner of
calling to the Ministry, even by that book of theyrs which he would have us
peruse as being agreeable to the Law of God: and see if God do not by themselves
uncover their nakedness, and make his truth (which they would hinder, yet) more
abound through their untruth unto his glory. It were long to stand upon all the
particulars which out of that book to this end might be alleged: and this
writing is already much langer then at first I purposed. I will therefore but
give a taste of some, by which you may perceyv what smack the rest have.

And first the very That (...) of making and consecrating Bisshops, Priest,
(...).
title of the book (as a mark in the forehead) evidently shows the
unlawfulness both of their office, and of their entrance into it. It is called
thus, The form and manner of making and consecrating Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons. Now if these offices, and this manner of entrance were appointed in the
Testament of Christ: what need or use were there of this book and form of
theyrs? But because they follow not the book of God and the form prescribed by
Christ, therefore have they framed to themselves this book and form out of the
Popes pontifical, and termed it as aforesaid.

Now as is the title, so be also the contents of that book. By it as likewise
by their practice it appears, that their first office of Ministry is the
Deaconship (not that ancient office of Deacons appointed by Christ, but) a
mere invention of man's brain and Antichristian. For first that office is not
employed (according to Act. 6. 2. 4. Romans 12. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. and 16. 1.
compared with Ephesians. ^ 11. 12.
Christ's ordinance) in gathering and distributing the Churches benevolence: but
contrary to the word of God, in reading their books of common prayer and
Homilyes, in administering Baptism, assisting the Priest in divine service, and
(with the Prelates license) in preaching the word. Secondly, at their entrance
and calling into that office, they must be presented by an Archdeacon (an
Antichristion officer) or his deputy. Thirdly they must promise reverend
obedience to their Ordinary and other chief Ministers of the Church, that is to
the Lordbishop of the Dioces, to the Archbishop, Archdeacon, Chauncelor,
Commissary, and the rest of that sort (whose offices also are Antichristian).
Fourthly they must be ordained by a Lordbishop or his Suffragane, whose office
likewise is of Antichrist. Fifthly, they must receyv the Communion with the
Lordbishop that day they are ordered. And thus must they testify that they ar^
of the same ^aith and body with the Prelates, who are known to be deadly
enemies of the truth and persecuters of the people of God. Sixthly, in stead of
true prayer there must be said or sung the Letany and Suffrages, with the
Communion of the Day and a number of Collects and stinted prayers, borrowed
from the Papists. Finally there must be read a Gospel and Epistle (as they
call their shredding of the Scripture): in which they abuse and pervert the
word of God, falsely fathering upon the Apostles an office of Deaconship which
they never ordained: that is, a Deaco^ry whose duties they assign to be, to
read public prayer, to baptize, to assist the Priest in divine service, and to
preach, being licensed thereunto: Whereas neither in the Apostles example nor
doctrine any such duties are laid upon the Deacons, but such as are directly
Act. 6. 2. 3. 4.
opposed to the Ministry of the word and prayer, that is, the having charge of
the poor and Church treasure. Romans 12. 8.
Besides that into that office of Deacons prescribed by the Apostles there is
no such entrance as is aforesaid, but a lawful choice and calling of a true
Church according to the word of God: as is recorded in the election of Deacons
mentioned in the Act. 6. 2 3. 5. 6. 1 Timothy 4. 8. 9 10. 1 Cor. 12. 28 with 2
Cor. 8. 19.
Acts of the Apostles and in other Scriptures. And thus for their first office
of Ministry it is manifest, that neither the office nor entrance into it is
agreeable to the Law of God. Which themselves also have seen and published
heretofore: Affirming that Defense of Eccles. discip. p. 02.
their Deaconship is a mere humane institution, a degree to the Priesthood, and
nothing like the ordinance of God, that Admon. to Parle. first treatise.
though the Name of Deacons be remaining among them, yet the office is fowly
perverted and turned vpside down: finally, that Defense of godly ^^ni^t. p. 108.
it is manifestly contrary to the word of God.

Neither is their calling and entrance to their next office of Ministry, that
is, to their Priesthood, any better. For (as appears both by their book and
practice) before they can be Priests, they must first be Deacons or half
Priests: that is, they must be ordained by a Prelate according to their book to
the false Antichristian office aforesaid. For by their Law it is the first step
to the Ministry, or rather a mere order of Pri^^^hood: as A (...) to (...).
themselves also have confessed heretofore. 2 Then in this Deaco^ship they must
serve a year, unless i^ seem otherwise to their Ordinary. 3 After a years
prentiship thereyn, when the Prelate their Ordinary gives Orders again, they
may be made full Priests: but it must be, of a Lordbishop or his Suffragane
which are Antichristian offices. 4 They must be presented to the Prelate by an
Archdeacon or his ^^pu^y to be admitted to the Order of Priesthood. 5. They
must promise (as before the Deacons did) reverently to obey their Ordinary and
other chief Ministers of the Church, that is, the Prelates and their Officers.
6. At their Ordination must be read over a certain of words of exhortation, of
colle^^^ and stinte^ prayers, with a Gospel and Epistle prescribed in the
book: wherein again they abuse and pervert the Scriptures, as before they did
about the Deaconship: Yea they are so blind, as they then read such As namely,
Ioh. 10. 1 -- 16. and 20. 21. 22. 23. Mat. 28. 18. 19. 20. Act. 6. 2 -- 6. and
20. 17. 27. 28 29. 30. 1 Timothy 3. ca.
Scriptures for their Gospels and Epistles as most plainly condemn this their
manner of entrance and calling. 7. After this, there must be said or sung, Come
holy Ghost etc. And sure they had need desire the holy Ghost to come upon them
and show them a better way: For now doubtless he is not present with them at
such profana^ion of Gods name, word, and ordinance, as is among them. 8. When
all is said and sung that is appointed, till it come to the Ordering of the new
priests, then must they that are to be made Priests humbly kneel upon their
knees at the feet of the Lordbishop. 9. And he with the Priests present lay
their hands severally upon the head of every one that receyveth Orders. 10. And
then the Lordbishop says to every of them (but not without blasphemy) Receyve
the holy Ghost: whose sins thou do forgive they as forgiven, and whose
sins thou do retain, they are retained. Whereupon some of themselves
seeing the impiety hereof, have published that Admon. to Parl. 2. ^reatise: se^.
21.
the Prelates take upon them blasphemously, having neither promise nor
commandment, to say to their new creatures (so they call them) Receyve the
holy Ghost: as though the holy Ghost were in their power to give without
vvarrant at their pleasure. 11. Being thus made Priests, when they enter into a
benefice, it must be by presentation of the patron of the benefice, and by
institution of the Lordbishop of the Dioces. 12. And then moreover must they
swear to yield Cano^icall obedience to the Lordbishop their ordinary and the
rest of that rabble.

Thus do themselves and their ministry stand subject to the Prelates and to
their Antichristian courts and i^cisdiction: diverse particulars whereof have
before often ben mentioned. And this is their manner of outvvard calling unto
their office of ministry, called the Priesthood. Yet have I not here related
all the strange, ridiculous, and abominable things, used at their entrance
into these offices: neither have I spoken at all of their consecration of
Archbishops and Lordbishops, prescribed also in that book whereunto Mr H.
refers us. It would griev any Christian heart to wade through such filthy
myer. And these few things are ynow (yea to many) to show how contrary that
their book and manner of outvvard calling to the Ministry is to the Book and
Law of God.

Now further it is to be minded, that Mr H. tells you not a word of these and
such like abominations used at their intrance to the ministry: but with much
colorable persuasion laboreth to cast a mist before your eyes, that you might
not perceyv the Antichristian wickedness of their estate. Markethe particulars
he notes here, and see how subtly he would ^arry away the matter: not only
passing over the impyetyes aforesaid and such like wherewith their book and
practice abounds: but in those things also which he mentions, under the
color of this, that he says their book requires men of unblameable life, and
aptnes to teach, to be examined, and admitted in a solemn assembly, would
cover and hide their receyving and retayning of men in the Ministry, which be
of most wicked and shameless life, others also that are no more able to preach
then Psalm. 115 5. with zach. 11. 17.
Idols, which have a mouth and speak not: whose examination it may be is soon
posted over, if they can bring with them a dish of apples well filled with gold
angels, or some such ready answer to satisfy the Prelate, and his Lordships
Examiner and other hungry officers. And commonly in their examination of the
best learned, it is but to know if he can answer a question or two in the
Latin toungue: and to see for such and the rest their letters testimonial,
which it may be are from some that are as ignorant and profane as any of
themselves. Is this to follow the 1 Timothy 3. 10.
rule of the Apostles, Let them first be proved, then let them minister, if
they be found blameles? Is this to make 1 Timothy 3. 2 -- 7. with Heb. 13. 17.
trial of his gifts and life so as behooves them to do, that committ their
souls to his watch and instruction? Or is this like the Act. 15. 22 26. 32.
and 16. 2. 3.
testimony that the Church gave to Barsabas, Silas, and Timothy? Or is it like
to the Act. 6. 3 5. 1 Timothy 3. cap. with Tit. 1. 5 -- 9.
diligent search and consideration enjoined by the Apostles and practiced by
the Church in the choice of the Deacons? H^w much more of the Bishop^ and
Elders?

But their Law (he says) commands that none should be admitted to the
office but in a solemn assembly, and that liberty should be granted to any in
Congregation to object whatsoever just impediment they know against him:
Well, yet let him tell us, what the people of Norwich when they stand gazing
upon the Prelate and his Archdeaco^ at his giving Orders, what the conversation
is of those that be ordered, whereof one comes out of Sufolk, another out of
Lincolneshire, a third from Cambridge, another from Oxford, others from Surrey,
Ke^t etc. whom perhaps they never saw nor heard of before, and it may be never
after? Let him also tell us if the Prelates do not often times make priests in
their private chapels, yea and in their closets too: and whether these be not
Priests by the Law, as well as the rest among them? Now then where is the
solemn assembly and Congregation he speaks of: unless he understand it of the
Prelates officers and servitors, who commonly are as wicked and irreligious as
their Lord and Master? Does Mr H. write this as of syncerity, as of God, in the
sight of God, as he professed in the entrance of his letter? Or does he not
rather go about to deceyv the Reader and darken the truth, when thus colourably
he would bear us in hand that the Law of God, which prescribes that the
Church and flock should approve and choose their own Minister, is observed
among them? And yet further let^ him answer, whether they be not commonly made
Priests at their own suite, without any people to attend upon, much less to
approve and choose them? Yea, whether often it be not so, as the people where
they are to minister never saw them before, till they come upon them with the
Patrones presentation and the Prelates induction to the benifice? Which when
they bring, the people are most that can do least, even just nothing at all:
For priests they must and will be there, whether the people will or not. Is
this to have the Churches choice and approbation? Is this to follow the Law of
GOD and to have that in substance which the word prescribes: as here Mr H.
pretends they have?

But above all, it is most strange that he would persuade us their law
requires their Ministers to be ordained by imposition of hands of the
Eldership: when all the world knows that they imprison, banish, and persecute
to death the poor Christians in the Land which follow that rule of God in
their judgment and practice. Yea and Mr H. himself Section, 10.
afterward in this letter confesses, both that the power of ordination among
them is by law committed to the Prelates, and that by the Law of God the
Prelates are not capable of it. How then possibly can this be true which here
he says, that their Law requires ordination to be done by imposition of the
hands of the Eldership, as the law of God does? These must needs be
contradictory the one to the other. But to proceed, if it were so as here he
pretends, why then has he with the rest of the forward preachers and people
so often sued to the Parliament for an Eldership (consisting of Pastors,
Teachers, and Elders) in every Church, if already they enjoy it? Do they sue
for that they have? that were a mockery. Or does not the Law expressly requier
that Book of ordering^ Priests. Also their Canons
imposition of hands among them be done by a Lordbishop or his Suffragane with
the Archdeacon and other Priests present? And are these now of late come to be
an Eldership? How is it then that the Prelates and their followers have
heretofore D. vvhitg last book. page 638. 639
written, that in the Apostles time there were Elders in every Church, but now
it ought not so to be? And that the seekers of Reformation have Admon. to Parl.
first and second treatise.
published, that not only the office of Elders but their Name also is out of
this English Church utterly removed, and that in stead of them in every Church
the Pope has brought in and they in England yet mainteyne the Lordship of one
man over many Churches, yea over sundry shires: Which Lordbishops being not
able (as the Elders) to execute their offices in their own persons without
substitutes, have therefore their under officers, as Suffraganes, Chauncelors,
Archdeacons, Officials, Commissaryes, and such like. Also, that they with their
Canons and Courts are drawn out of the Popes shop, and take upon them which is
most horrible the rule of GOds Church, thrusting away most sacrilegiously that
order which Christ has left in his Church and which the Primitive Church has
used, yea robbing the Church of lavvfull Pastors, Elders, and Deacons. Thus and
much more have themselves written heretofore. Yet see how now Mr H. would
persuade us they have the Eldership prescribed in the word: And, that whereas
there is want of due execution of such things in their Church as the Law of
God commands, that is the fault of the men, not of the calling. As if the
limbs of Antichrist were now become the Eldership ordained by Christ? And the
Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons, with their other priests and Officers
whom the Apostles never knew, were to be accounted those Elders whom the
Apostles planted in the Primitive Churches?

Those Elders had a Act. 14. 23. Heb. 5 4 Tit. 1. 5. with Act. 6. 2. 3. 5 1.
Tim. 4. 14. Number. 8. 9. 10. 2 Cor. 8. 19.

15 ^0. 22. 23. id 20. 17. 28.
administer according to the word of God, in the Church whereof and whereto
they were called: These Prelates and Priests (as has been proved) have an
unlawful calling in a false Church, to a false office never set by Christ in
his Church, which also they are bound to administer according to their popish
Canons, Articles, and Injunctions: besides that many of them have Lordship over
many Churches and sundry shires.

Those Elders performed their office in their 1 These. 5. 12. 13 14 Act. 20. 17.
28. Iam. 5. 14 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. Heb. 13. 7. 17. 24.
own persons: These Prelates and Priests have their substitutes, Vicars, and
under officers.

Those Elders were in 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16.
no office belonging to Antichrist: These Prelates and Priests have the Their
Canons, Po^tificall, and constitution shovv it.
very offices without which no Church of Antichrist (pretending to be Christ's)
can be absolute and complete in all the Canonical functions of Antichrists
ministry and government.

Those Elders had offices which must 1 Timothy 5. 17. 19. with 6. 13. 14. To. 1^.
4 -- 8. Act. 14. 23. and 20. 17. 28. with Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. 13. Rev. 2. 25.
Heb 12. 28. Mat. 28. 20.
continue to the end of the world: yea even then, when Antichrist in all the
parts offices and power of his Ministry and religion shall be consumed by the
Gospel of Jesus Christ: These Prelates and Priests have such offices as till
they be abolished, all the offices of Antichrists Hierarchy are not destroyed:
Which the 2 These. 2. 3. 8. with. Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. and 17. 1. and 18. 20. 21.
and 19. Cap. with Ier. 51. 60 -- 64.
Scripture testifyeth shall come to pass by the Spirit of the Lords mouth in
the light and power of his Gospel.

To conclude then, these Prelates and Priests are as unlike to those Elders, as
darkness is to light, and the forgeryes of Antichrist to the ordinances of Jesus
Christ. Where then is the imposition of hands of the Eldership which Mr H.
would make us beleev their Ministers have? Or is the want now among them not of
the offices of Elders, but only of upright Dealers therein, as here he would
persuade? Thus then you see that their Ministers having no other office nor
calling then the Law allows, have not at all the substance of the office or
calling of Ministers which the word prescribes, whatsoever color he pretend
to the contrary.

And yet (I pray you) what has he said more for the manner of calling to their
Priesthood, then may be alleged for the popish priests? For the Popes
pontifical (out of which their book is drawn) requires the same things at
the entrance to the priesthood, which Mr H. alleges their book does: As, that
they be of unblameable life, apt to teach, examined, allowed, ordered in a
solemn assembly, and such like. Yet I trow Mr H. will not conclude, that the
popish priests have therefore the substance either of a true office or of a
true calling to the Ministry. Or if he should, yet will the consequence never
be proved either for those Priests or for their own.

Neither let any think it strange, that their book and pontifical should have
some things that the Law of GOd has, and yet that this should nothing help
them for having a true calling to the Minist^ry. In the prophecy of Daniel we
read, that Dan. 5. 1. 2. 3.
when king Be^shazar made a great feast to his Princes, he commanded that the
golden and silver vessels that were taken out of the Temple of the Lords house
at Jerusalem should be brought, and the king and his Princes, his wines and his
concubynes drank therein. Now although they had there the vessels of the Lords
house and drank in them, yet was it not therefore a feast of the Lord, but a
feast of Babylon notwithstanding. Even so it fares with the Ministry and
entrance into it, used in England and among the Papists: Towching which
although their book and pontifical have taken some things out of the scripture
(as it were some of the Lords vessels out of his Temple) yet inasmuch as they
are applied by them to a false office, ordination, and ministration never
appointed by Christ but invented by Antichrist (even as it were in a Caldean
banquet), they do no more make their Priesthood or calling unto it to be the
Ministry and calling ordained by Christ, then those vessels taken out of the
LOrds house made that banquet of Babylon to be one of the Lords of which read
Levit. 23.
feasts. Likewise in the prophecy of Ezechiel we are taught that albeit men set
their thresholds by Gods thresholds and their posts by Gods posts (that is,
E^^ch. 43. 8,
their inventions by Gods ordinances) yet it makes them not therefore to be
the house and Temple of God and to have his true worship and ministry among
them: but as the Lord there testifyeth by his Prophet, by this means they set
a wall between God and themselves and defile his holy Name with their
abominations.

This is the account the Lord makes of the joining of his ordinances with man's
inventions: And what then will it help the Priests of England or Rome, that
their book and Law requier some things that the word of God prescribes, seeing
they join and apply them to a false ministry devised by man? It may in deed
make the mist which through their delusions they cast before the eyes of the
people to be far the greater: but it can no way justify their standing or
lessen their sin. Nay rather it does increase it, because thus they prohaue
the word of God and defile his holy Name, and cause them to ^rre that are led
by them. And thus against themselves they verify the 2 These. ^ 7. Rev. 17. 5.
Scripture which calls the apostasy of Antichrist and the working thereof a
mystery of iniquity.

But yet further, if their Law agree in deed with the Law of God as it should,
what need Mr H. coy^e so many excuses for the authority of their Lordbishops
and the calling receyved from them, as Section 10.
afterward he does? For if it agree with Gods Law, it need no excuse: If it do
not (which in deed is their case) no excuses will help: no fig tree leaves
will cover the nakedness of such deformity: Specially now, when by the light of
Gods word it is so discovered, as themselves have see^ it and laid it open to
the view of others: howsoever now they win^ with their eyes that they might not
see, and would also blyndfold others by their pleading to the contrary.
Therefore will I conclude this point with their own testimony wherein Admon, to
Parliam. ^treatise section, 14. 16. 20.
they confess (as the truth is) that their pontifical whereby they make
ministers is taken out of the Popes pontifical: that their ordering of
Ministers is strange from the word of God: that their entrance is not by
Christ but by a popish and unlawful vocation: that when the Bishops have
made them Ministers, either they may tarry in their Colleges and lead the lives
of loytering losels as long as they live, or else go abroad with the Bishops
Bulls like to Circumcellions to preach in other men's charges where they list,
or else get benefices by friendship or money or flattery where they can catch
them, or to conclude, if all these fail, that they may go up and down like
beggars and fall to many follyes, or else (as many have done) set up bills at
Paul's or at the Royal exchange and in such public places, to see if they
can hear of some good Masters to entertayne them into service. This is their
own confession towching their entrance to the Ministry, and this is the
testimony which themselves have heretofore given unto the truth, though now (as
you see) they labor by all means they can to obscure it: even Ier. 51. 8. 9.
58. 64.
wearying themselves in vain, whiles they would cure Babel, and lay plasters
on her sore, which can not be healed. To which end besides all that has been
brought hitherto, yet see what more balm Mr H. brings now also in the
conclusion of his matter: Which is thus as follows, being the last words of
his letter.

Mr H: his letter. Section, 10.
But you will say, which of you all have such a calling as has been said is
prescribed by Law: I answer, that many Ministers in the land have, and all
may if they will have, these substantial parts of a true calling: their gifts
may be examined and approved by such as are learned and godly, upon whose
judgment they may safely rely themselves i^ that (...): they may be chosen and
approved by the people that they are to be set over: they may be rightly
ordained and as it were invested into their office.

But your vvriting affirms they come in by the Bishops who are the limbs of
Antichrist, Whatsoever is unlawful in their callings, I will not go about
to mainteyne: Only I will simply and plainly set down what has moved me
to seek a calling from them, and what persvvadeth me to think that the calling
I have receyved from them is not wicked and unlawful.

First, being persuaded in my conscience that the Lord had a true Church in
this Realm even at the beginning of her Maiestyes reign, which being
assembled out of all the parts of the Land in Parliament, did commit this
authority to ordeyne Ministers unto the Bishops: and knovving out of the word
of God that every true Church has this power and authority to ordeyne
Ministers: I considered with my self that though the Church offended in
committin-this power and authority unto them that by the Law of God were not
capable of it, yet I might without sin seek and take the Churches ordination
at their hands: as I may reverence and take the benefit of the Princes power
and authority which is of God, though it be committed unto and exercised by
men that by the Law of God are not capable of it.

Secondly, seeing it is a thing not to be refused if a man entering into the
ministry might have the approbation of all and every one of the Ministers of
the Gospel in the land: it seems unto me the approbation of that Bishop that
is also a Minister and preacher of the Gospel cannot be deemed to be merely
unlawful.

Thirdly, the authority of the Christian Magistrate (without whose liking and
allowance a Minister cannot be admitted to the Ministry in peace) coming to
the Bishop by Act of Parliament, I may more boldly come to him for his
approbation in regard of the Law: not looking so much unto the Man, as
^^garding with reverence the power of the Law and Christian Magistrate.

Answer to Section, 10.
I Am sorry to see Mr H. thus weary himself in seeking balm for the healing of
Babels sore, which cannot be cured. We need not ask him (as here he devises
an objection with himself) which of them have such a calling as is prescribed
by the Law: For notwithstanding their manifold breaches even of their own Law,
yet we doubt not but ynow and to many of them have the calling appointed by
Law: that is, are made. Deacons and Priests by a Lordbishop, according to their
book taken out of the Popes pontifical, contrary to the Testament of Christ:
and are also presented by the Patrones, and instituted by the Prelates, to cure
of souls: whereof would to God they made not merchandise, as the Rev. 18. 11.
13.
Scripture speaks. The oftener then that he mentions this, he does but so
much the more cast doung in their own faces.

Neither is it to be past over (but well to be observed) that himself here
reckons up and accounts these three to be substantial parts of a true
calling to the ministry, 1. A due examination of gifts: 2. The choice and
approbation of the people that they are to be set over: 3. A right ordination
into their office. These three he says are substantial parts of a true
calling: Wherevpo^ it follows, that none of their Ministers have the
substance of a true calling, seeing they want these substa^tiall parts thereof:
as is proved In the a^nsvver to Section, 6. 8. 9
before and afterward again, and as their own estate testifyeth against them
to their faces. Yea Mr H himself up his own words here imports thus much,
that diverse at least of their ministers want the substance of a true calling.
Else (when he answers to his own objection) why says he, Many Ministers in
the Land have these substantial parts: and says not, that all their Ministers
have them? Many he says, and not all. Thus to uphold some of their Ministers
(if he could), he cares not to smite down others of them to the ground: and
those also such, as have the same Ministry and calling with the rest, which is
prescribed by Law. But compare this with that which he wrote, and see what a
fair thread he has spun for himself. Al their Ministers have not the substance
of a true calling: This he insinuates here, and in his own understanding of
the substantial parts set down by himself cannot deny it if he would. Yet all
their Ministers be made Priests or Deacons, or both, by the Prelates, according
to their book aforesaid: This also he yielded Section. 9.
before, neither if he would can deny it. The conclusion therefore must be
this, that the Priests and Deacons so made by the Prelates according to their
book (such as be all their Ministers) have not the substance of a true calling
to the Ministry. This you see follows upon his own aunswers: Besides that we
omit to speak of their presentations, and of their inductions by the Prelates,
which the Law appoynteth as substantial parts of their calling when they take
charge of souls. Only mark here again his contradictio^ with himself, whiles
he stribeth against the truth.

Now to proceed, let him tell us whom he means here by the learned and godly
whose examination and approbation they are to have, and on whose judgment they
may safely rely in that matter. If he mean the Archdeacon or other Priests
that be examiners for the Prelates (as their Law and use is): how will he prove
that they are such as he says, that is, learne^ and godly? or that their
examination and approbation was ever appointed by Christ, or is to be had as a
substautiall part of true calling to the Ministry? or finally, that any may
safely rely upon their judgment in this matter? But if he mean (as doubtless he
does) the examination and approbatio^ of some of the forward Preachers among
them: himself knows, first that the Law appoynteth it not: whereupon will
follow by his own assertion that all the substa^tiall parts of a true calling
to the ministry are not prescribed by Law, which yet Section 9.
before he labored to prove. Secondly he is not ignorant, and their
constitution and practice shows it, that although secretly (it may be) some
of them are tried and approved by such as here he inte^deth, yet neither is
this general, and those also which have this, have notwithstanding and must
have that other which law binds unto. Now if that after the Law be of Christ,
why have they the other? If it be not of Christ, why receyv they it at all, or
how is it true which he said ( Section 9.
) before, that their Law agrees with the Law of God, as towching the substance
of a true calling to the Ministry? Thirdly, are not these forward preachers
also (as well as the other) Deaco^s and Priests, so ordained by the Prelates as
aforesaid: and therefore have a Ministry never ordained by Christ, but brought
in by Antichrist? And what privilege them have they herein more then the other?
Or how will it be proved for them, any more then for the other, that thus
standing their examination and allowance is an ordinance of Christ, or
substantial part of true calling to the Ministry? Or that any may safely rely
themselves upon their judgment in this matter?

For the next likewise, that is, the choice and approbatio^ of the people that
they are to be set over: if he mean it generally of any people whatsoever,
whether Idolaters, Atheists, Papists, or others standing subject to Antichrist,
or such like: how will he ever prove that such have this power and authority of
Christ, to choose the Ministers of his Gospel? Or if he mean it (as needs he
must if he speak to the purpose) of such people as by the word of God be called
and separated from the world, joined in covenant and fellowship of the Gospel,
being true visible Churches of Christ: then also how will it ever be proved
that their people in this their Church constitution (as now they stand in
confusion and spiritual bondage to Antichrists Ministry, worship, ordinances,
courts, and jurisdiction), are such people and Churches, having the power and
liberty which Christ has given to his Church for trying and choosing their own
Ministers according to the rules of his Testament? Is it possible that they
which stand in subjectio^ to Antichrist, should also be the freemen of Jesus
Christ? Or that the privileges of Christ's Church should belong unto and be
found in the Synagogues of Antichrist? 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16.
Christ and Belial cannot agree together. 2. But yet further what choice and
allowa^ce is it that they pretend to have of the people? Is it not a secret
gathering of the co^se^t of some few in the town or parish? And ca^ this
interest them to the charge of the souls of the whole town or parish, when
most of them neither give their consent nor have it asked. But it may be he
will say, they dare not trust any herein but some few, or that they account
them not to be godly minded. Yet dare they Minister the Sacraments to them all,
and receyv them and their seed as members of the Church, and take maintenance
from them as from the Church. Is this to walk uprightly before the Lord, and to
go with an even foot to the truth of the Gospel, 3. But be it that all the
people gave their consent: yet whom and whereto do they choose? Choose they not
one that either is already, or before he can minister to them must be made,
Deacon or Priest or both by a Lordbishop? who also must in that Ministry
administer to them their holy things according to their book of Common prayer
and other their Canons and constitutions? Now that such a choice and
approbation is a substantial part of true calling, who ever can persuade or be
persuaded? 4. Or does their Law appoint and allow this choice and approbation
of the people for lawful and sufficient? Who is it that knows not the
contrary? For whether it be had, or not, the Law requires and they must have
their ministry from the Prelates, and when they take cure of souls, the
Patrones presentation, and the Prelates induction into the benefice. And this
only is that which stands for sufficient in their* Law and constitution.
Hence therefore again appears even by his own assertion (contrary to that
which Section, 9.
before he would have proved) that the Law appoynteth not the substance of a
true calling to the Ministry, neither agrees with the Law* of God therein:
forasmuch as not only it appoynteth not the peoples choice (which Act. 6. 2 3.
5. and 14. 23. and 1. 15. 23. 26. 2 Cor. 8. 19. Ezech. 33. 2. Number. 8. 9. 1 Cor.
16. 3.
Gods word requires) but in stead thereof enioyneth presentatio^ by a Patron
(be he Papist, Atheist, or whatsoever) and induction by a Lordbishop: which God
never commanded, but was and is retained from the Popes Canons, custom, and
pontifical. 5. Moreover, if the peoples choice and approbation be the true
choice and calling (as here he grants): why then do they take that other of
the Patrones and Prelates, never appointed by Christ, but forged by Antichrist?
Is it because they would have all men know, that in their constitution 2 These.
2. 3. 4.
the man of sin is exalted above God and his holy ordinances? Or because they
would have it seen of all, that they Ezech. 43. 8.
set their thresholds by Gods thresholds, that they may defile his Name? Will
they never learn, that 2. Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16.
Christ and Antichrist, light and darkness, cannot have fellowship and concord
together? To end this point then, seeing the peoples choice (by his own
confession) is a substantial part of true calling to the Ministry (and this
is to be understood of such people only as be the true visible Churches of
Christ, and their people in their estate can not by the word of God be
accounted such, but in deed to stand in spiritiall slavery to Antichrist) it is
evident they neither have, nor as they stand can have, the substance of a true
calling to the Ministry of the Gospel of Christ.

Towching the last substantial part he assigns, which is a right ordination
into their office: if he mean of that which is had from the Prelates (which
only the Law appoynteth) how will he prove it to be a substantial part of
true calling to the Ministry? Specially, it being no ordinance of Christ but
part of Antichrists apostasy, as has been showed Sec (...) 6. 8. 9.
before: and seeing also the power of ordination is such as by the Law of God
the Prelates are not capable thereof: as him self here grants and affirms
in plain words. If he mean of some other besides to be had among them (not
from the Prelates, but) from some of their forward Preachers: then first he is
to mind that here again he crosses himself, beause making this a substantial
part of true calling, and the Law not appoynting it (as it does not), it
follows hereupon that the Law prescribes not the substance of a true calling
to the Ministry: Which before he affirmed. 2. Again, if this be so, what
becomes of all the Ministers in the Land that have not this other ordination,
but that only of the Prelates and Priests present as the Law appoynteth,
neither have the choice of the people, nor examination and allowance of the
Learned and godly he speaks of? All such by his own account have not the
substance of a true calling: and therefore cannot be true Ministers: for these
three he says are substantial parts thereof. Now in the Land there be an
hundred of these for one of the other. Is not their Ministry (think you) well
holy up by this means? 3. Nay and what one of them all that pretend to have
this other, dare stand forth before their LOrds the Prelates, and avow^h their
Ministry by virtue thereof? When they come before them, they can show their
letters of Orders receyved from them: howsoever before their followers (to
mislead them) they color the matter otherwise. 4. Furthermore, have not these
forward Preachers themselves receyved their Ministry from the Prelates and
retain it still unto this day? How then can a right ordination possibly be had
from such? Who can Job. 14. 4
bring a clean thing out of filthynes? Is it (...) 7. 16. (...) 14. 25. 10.
with 2 These. 2. 3.
possible that a lawful ordination should be had from the Ministers and
apostasy of Antichrist? Either is this utterly to leave and forsake (which we
Esa. 52. 11. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 17.
ought) or is it not rather still to cleave unto and retain (which under Rev.
14. 9. 10. 11. and 17. 1. and 18. 4. with 2. These. 2. 10. 11. 12.
pain of damnation we may not) the Ministry and abominations of Antichrist
that son of perdition?

It remains then, that their calling to the Ministry being examined by these
particulars, which Mr H. himself has here assigned to be substa^tiall parts of
a true calling: they neither have, neither whiles they thus stand, ca^ have, a
true calling to the Ministry of the Gospel. Thus well has he reasoned for
their calling, and answered the objection framed by himself.

Now in his writing there follows another objection, with his answer
thereunto: Whereyn he pleads again with as ill success as before. The
objection is this, that it is affirmed they come in by the Bishops, who are the
limbs of Antichrist. The objection suerly is of weight, and had need be
soundly answered. For if the Prelates be the limbs of Antichrist, and they
also come into their Ministry by them, it cannot be avoided but their
Ministry (by virtue whereof they deal with the holy things of God, and work
upon men's consciences) is Antichristian: and therefore not to be receyved or
joined unto: Which is the thing that was to be proved. What is it then that he
says hereunto? Does he deny that the Prelates be limbs of Antichrist, and
prove the contrary by the Scripture? No in deed: but he leaves them as he
found them, the limbs of Antichrist: and seems so astonyed partly at the
truth on the one hand, partly with the unlawfulness of their office on the other
as notwithstanding they are thus deeply charged, yet he denies not the charge
but rather yields unto it, saying, that whatsoever is unlawful in their
callings he will not go about to mainteyne: Yea, that by Law of God they are
not capable of that which is committed unto them by the Parliament. Where
besides that he leaves them without defense against so weighty an accusation,
he does himself also charge them with breach of Gods Law and unlawfulness in
their callings: and so yields us the cause. The Prelates and his fellow Priests
will not thank him for this. And sure if any way it could have been done, now
was it altogether needful to have convinced by evidence of Scripture, both
that the Prelates are not the limbs of Antichrist, and that their offices and
callings are lawful. But the truth is mighty, and will prevayle against all
that withstand it, ^^ll they, will they.

Well then, leaving thus the Prelates to be limbs of Antichrist, what says he
to the other, which is, that the Ministers of the land come into their
Ministry by the Prelates? Does he deny this? No, but grants it also, as
needs he must. For such is their constitution and practice: Besides that if any
standing Ministers of these assemblyes should enter otherwise, they could not
but be intruders and hypocrites. Intruders, because they should thrust
themselves into their Ministry either by no calling, or by other then is
receyved and allowed in their Church: Hypocrites, because ministering in and to
these assemblyes they should seem unto men to do it by virtue of such calling
as is appointed by Law of their Church, when in deed it were otherwise. It
cannot be denied then but they do and must come in by the Prelates, who are
limbs of Antichrist. Now what follows hereupon, let themselves and all that
partake with them well consider and repent, whiles Heb. 3. 7. etc.
it is called To day.

But says Mr H. nothing in this point at all? Yes: though he leave the
Prelates and other Priests to shift for themselves yet for himself he takes a
little pains: saying, he will simply and plainly set down what moved him to
seek a calling from the Prelates, and what persuades him to think the calling
he receyved from them is not wicked and unlawful. Well: but what if the
other Ministers of the Land (who take themselves to have as a good a calling as
he, yet) were not moved neither are persuaded thereunto by these reasons
whereupon he rest^th? what now will he, and what must we account of their
Ministry by this reckoning? Again, what if the reasons he alleges for
himself be not of weight in this case so to move and persuade either him or any
other? How then will he have us esteem of his calling and Ministry? Let us
therefore examine his reasons. But first mark that he says, he sought a
calling from the Prelates and receyved it. He was not the^ sought spyed out,
and called by a Church (as is the Heb. 5. 4. with Act. 6. 2. 3. 5. and 14. 23.
Ezech 33. 2. 2 Cor. 8. 19.
ordinance of Christ) but himself, he says, sought to be called by the
Prelates, and receyved his calling from them. Which manner of calling seeing it
is such as God never ordained, it therefore neither might be receyved of him,
neither may be joined unto by any other. But let us see what moved him hereunto.

FIrst (says Mr H.) being persuaded in my conscience that the Lord had a true
Church in this Realm even at the beginning of her Maiestyes reign, which
being assembled out of all parts of the Land in Parliament did commit this
authority to ordeyne Ministers unto the Bishops: and knovving out of the word
of GOD that every true Church has this power and authority to ordeyne
Ministers: I considered with my self, that though the Church offended in
committing this power unto them that by the Law of God were not capable of
it, yet I might without sin seek and take the Churches ordination at their
hands: as I may reverence and take the benefit of the Princes power and
authority which is of God, though it be committed unto and exercised by men
that by the Law of God are not capable of it.

THis is Mr H. his first and chief reason. Wherein (as also in the rest
following) let this be observed generally, that although in the Section, 1.
Page 1.
beginning of his letter he promised nothing should be brought to persuade, but
the word of GOd, yet now in stead thereof he sets before us the persuasions
of his conscience (Which is a thing very usual among them): as if they were
either divine oracles, or as foroible to persuade as they. Yea, here he seems
to prefer his persuasions before Gods oracles: (Which if he had not done, I
would not thus have noted it). For confessing on the one hand, that he knows
out of the word of God that every true Church has this power and authority to
ordeyne Ministers (and consequently that it is Gods ordinance to have it in and
from a true Church, as he has appointed): yet on the other hand he professes,
that the Parliament committing this power unto such as by the Law of God are
not capable of it, to wit, to the Prelates (and so offending therein), he
notwithstanding upon his persuasion sought and took ordination from the
Prelates hands. Now what was this else, but to regard his own persuasion more
then the word of God? Specially, when he joins withal, that he thought he
might so do without sin. Sure, this is strange divinity. The Scripture
teaches, that we 1 Timothy 5 22.
may not be partakers of other men's sins: And, that 1 Ioh. 3. 4.
the transgression of Gods Law is sin. He notwithstanding thought that he
might partake with others in the breach of Gods ordinance, and yet not sin. I
hope he is otherwise minded since, and so will be every day more and more. In
the mean time it is clear, that though these very things which he would seem
to rest upon were all granted him, yet they make altogether against him: and
so this first reason of his is found in this case to be of no weight. Yet
before we proceed to the rest, it will not be amiss for more evidence of the
truth more fully to consider the particulars here set down.

1 And first where he says he is persuaded the Lord had a true Church in this
Realm at the beginning of her Majestyes reign etc. it would be known whether
he speak of invisible or of a visible Church of God. If he speak of invisible,
he speaks not to the point in question: besides that they could not be
counted an invisible Church, and yet be known to be assembled together in
Parliament. If he speak of a visible Church (as he must if he will speak to the
purpose, and as it seems he means because he says they were then assembled
together) then how does he prove this to be so? In deed we deny not but God had
his flock and Church even a true visible Church in this Land at the beginning
of her Majestyes reign: For we have heard and read that in Queen Maryes days
there was here a Congregation of faithful people separated from the rest of
the Land and gathered into fellowship together to serve the LORD according to
his word, and to keep themselves pure from the abominations of Antichrist: That
this Congregation also choose them Ministers, Elders, and Deacons, to instruct
guide and serve them in the Lord: and that they had their holy meetings, and
showed notable testimonies of their faith and love. So long then as they kept
communion in this way, we deny not but they were a true visible Church: though
(it may be) in some defects through want of further light and instruction. The
like we think also of our countrymen that were then at Frankford, Geneva, and
other where beyond seas. But when Queen Mary dyed, and Queen Elizabeth (whom
God long preserve) came to the Crown, then the Mass and some other
superstitions of popery being abolished, against which these Congregations had
witnessed the truth in much affliction, they hereupon dissolved, and the
several members scattered themselves to their parishes here and there
throughout the Land: commingling themselves in confusion with the rest of the
land that were Idolaters and repented not: and submitting their souls to the
Prelates and to the Ministry receyved from and executed under them: as also to
their courts, canons, excommunications, and other Antichristian jurisdiction
retained in the Land: And so have continued in apostasy from the way of Christ
unto this day. Now these Congregations being thus dissolved, and the members
there of thus standing: they were not now any longer true visible Churches in
the order of Christ, but fallen into confusion with the world and into
spiritual bondage to the Prelates and other Clergy the limbs of Antichrist.
So as from hence for the point in hand Mr H. can derive no help for himself.

But be it that they had remained still visible Churches in true constitution,
and had assembled together and committed this authority of ordination to the
Prelates: Yet this being not warrantable by the word of God, it had bound no
man's conscience, neither ben sufficient warrant for any to partake in their
sins. For the sinful actions of the Church do not bynd or warrant us any
more, then the sinful actions of the world: Neither can all Churches or
Nations under heaven make that lawful, which God by his word makes unlawful.
Though Exodus 32 cap.
all the people of Israel (being the true Church of God) enjoyne and commit
unto Aaron to make a molten calfe to go before them: Yet was not Aaron
therefore bound or warranted thereunto, but sinned in so doing: as they also
did that took part thereyn. Again (for example sake) let us suppose that
which in deed was not, to wit, that Moses and Aaron and all that were famous in
the Congregation, yea that the whole Congregation of Israel (being the true
Church) should have committed to Corah, Dathan, Abiram, and their company,
power to take censers and burn incense thereyn before the LOrd: Number. 16 cap.
yet they being not capable of that power by the Law of GOD, neither might have
taken it, neither might any other have communicated with them thereyn: but all
that would not perish in their sin should have departed from them and their
tents. When 2 King. 16. (...) 16. with Esa 7. and 8 cap.
Achaz King of Judah appointed and Altar to be made after the fashion of the
altar of Damascus (though the disciples and people of God which at that time
were in Judah should have consented thereyn, and committed power to Vryah and
the other Priests to offer upon it burnt offerings and peace offerings, and that
to no other but the true God): Yet should not ^riah or any other therefore
either have done it or partaken thereyn. When 1 King. 12. 20 -- 31.
Jeroboam King of Israeel took counsel with his Princes and people, and made
Priests of the lawest of the people which were not of the sons of Levi (and
therefore not capable of the Priests office) though the ten tribes, having ben
til this time the Church and people of God, consented thereunto: Yet did not
this therefore bynd or warrant any of them either to receyv that office, or to
join unto them in the worship of God. To come nearer our own days, let us
suppose that which himself will think is as likely if not more the^ that he
alleges, to wi^, that in this Land was a true Church at the end of King
Edwards days, which being assembled out of all parts of the La^d in
Parliament in the beginning of Q: Maryes reign, did commit this power and
authority of ordination to the Prelates (whereof by the Law of God they were
not capable): Yet will not Mr H. say, but it was unlawful notwithstanding for
any to seek or receyve ordination from then. Otherwise what impiety is there
that by this means might not be made at least some what tolerable: as may
appear by the examples and insta^ces before mentioned and infinite other that
might be alleged? The same Parliament whereof he speaks, authorizing the
book of common prayer did thereyn (he knows) commit power and authority unto
weome^ in cases of necessity to baptize (whereof by the Law of God they are
altogether incapable): 1 Cor. 14 34 35. 1 Ti. 2. 12. compared with Ephesians. 4. 11.
12. and Mat. 28. 18. 19.
will he therefore say, it is lawful either for women to administer Baptism,
or for any to yield their children to be baptized of them: because they may
reverence and take benefit of the Princes power and authority which is of
God, though it be committed unto and exercised by such as by the Law of God
are not capable of it? Many mo particulars might be alleged of like nature
both out of the Scriptures and Laws of this and other Nations: but for the
matter in hand the former allegations may suffice.

2. Next where Mr H. says, that at the beginning of her Maiestyes reign the
Parliament committed this authority to ordeyne Ministers to the Bishops: he
mistaketh the matter, if he think that then first they receyved it. For the
authority of ordination was not then first committed unto the Prelates, but
continued to them from former times: and ratifyed unto them both at that time
and afterward again in the eight year of her Highness reign, as may appear
by the Anno. 1. Eliz. cap. 1. and 8. Eliz. cap. 1.
statu^es then enacted. Which it seems the Prelates and Priests of the La^d
desired, because their offices and authority being called into question, they
were not able to bring warrant for them out of the Law of God, and therefore
got what strength they could from the Law of Man. The truth then is, that not
at the beginning of her Majestyes reign, but hundreds of years before her
Majesty was borne, the Prelates had this power of ordination in their hands as
much as now they have. For who knows not that both their offices and callings
and this their authority of ordination is part of the 2 These. 2 3. Rev. 9. 1. 2
3.
apostasy of the Man of sin? even part of those Rev. 17. 4. 5. and 18. 3.
abominatio^s wherewith the golden cup of the whore of Babylon is full, and
wherewith she has long syn^e made drunken the nations of the earth, and this
of England among the rest? Many of which abominations we confess have been
swept out of this Land both in the time of King Henry the eight, and of King
Edward the sixth, and of Elizabeth our dread Sovereign: For which we praise
God. Yet notwithstanding (to speak as the truth is) many also of those
abominatio^s of Babylon are remaining in the La^d, from which it was never
purged unto this day: Of which sort are the offices, callings, administration,
and maintenance, both of the Prelacy and other clergy yet retained in the Land,
from the highest Prelate to the lowest Priest, together with their book worship,
canons, compulsion and confusion of all sorts of people whatsoever to be
members of their Church and such like which were long to relate in particular.

So then if Mr H. would have simply and plainly showed unto us the original
of this power and authority in the Prelates, he should have led us, not to the
beginning of her Maiestyes reign (as if it had then begun) but to the apostasy
of the man of sin: from whence it first sprang and spread abroad into this and
other Nations of the earth, many ages before her Highness reign or birth.
Neither has it hitherto ben abolished out of this land, as it ought: but being
found here at the beginning of her Maiestyes reign, was left remaining still,
and is not suppressed but retained eve^ unto this day. Wherevpo^ is come to
pass, that the Prelates and Priests retayning still their calling and
authority, have by the just judgment of God showed themselves to be nothing
behind the Number. 33. 55. Joshua 23. 13. with Judge. 1. cap, and 3. 4.
Cananites, Hivites, Iebusites, and other inhabitants of the Nations whom God
commanded Israel to drive out before them, and they notwithstanding let them
still remain among them: that is, they are become pricks in our eyes and
thorns in our sides, vexing all such as fear God in the Land: and it is to be
feared (if Gods mercy be not the greater) will be a snare and destruction to
the Land, as already they are to the souls and consciences of the people
therein.

The Lord stir up the royal heart of her Majesty, that she may discern their
iniquity and abolish their offices and callings out of the Land, and make them
desolate and naked, eating their flesh, even their revennewes and poffessions,
by converting them to her own civil uses and the weal publik of the Land.
The Same God, the King of Kings, work it also in the hearts of the other Princes
and Magistrates of the world, that they may do likewise within their Dominions:
that so the most wicked Hierarchy and religion of Antichrist may be utterly
consumed from of the earth, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ may have free
passage and be glorified among all nations to the ends of the world: as the
Scripture has said shall come to pass. Rev. 17. 16. and 18. 20. 21. and 14.
6. 7. 8. and 21. 15. 24. 26. with 2 These. 2. 8. and 3. 1. Mat. 24. 14.

3 Thirdly where Mr H. says, he knew out of the word of God that every true
Church of GOD has the power and authority to ordeyne Ministers, and that the
Prelates by the Law of God are not capable of it, and yet that he sought and
took ordination of the Prelates: this is so far from being any defense unto him
in this case, as it does rather manifest his sin to be the greater and far
more grievous: inasmuch as hereby it seems he took ordination of the
Prelates, against the knowledge which he had out of the word of God to the
contrary.

4. Fourthly let it be observed, that here he says the Parliament offended in
committing the power and authority of ordination to the Prelates, that by the
Law of God are not capable of it: and yet before he affirmed, that their Law
agrees with the Law of GOD as towching the substance of a true calling to the
Ministry, of which he made right ordination to be a part. Thus he both
contradicts himself, and again yields the cause. For if they offended
against the Law of God in committing this power to the Prelates (as he directly
affirms) and there is no other Ministry had and all^^ed in the Land but from
the Prelates (as there is not): hence it must needs follow, that their calling
and Ministry is unlawful, and neither to be receyved nor joined unto.

5. Fifthly, where he calls the ordination taken from the Prelates, the
Churches ordination receyved at their hands: and yet before said, the Church
has power to ordeyne, but the Prelates by the Law of God are not capable of
it: here again he forgets and contradicts himself.

6. Finally, it may be observed that in the shutting up of this reason he
speaks of the Princes power and authority committed to men that by the Law of
God are not capable of it, when as before in the former part of the reason he
had spoken of the Churches power and authority committed to such as by the Law
of God are not capable of it. Thus he keeps not to the point in question: but
speaking of ordination of Ministers, one while he caryeth us to the Churches
power and authority committed to men not capable thereof, another while to the
Princes power, so likewise committed: As if the power and authority of Princes
and of the Church were all one and not distinct in the ordinance and
appointment of God: or as if whatsoever may be done in the one, were also to be
admitted in the other. What strange consequences would follow hereupon, let
himself consider. And hitherto of the insufficiency of his first reason. Now
let us see if there be any more wayght in his second: which is as follows.

SEcondly ( says Mr H.) seeing it is not to be refused, if a man entering into
the Ministry might have the approbation of all and every one of the Ministers
of the Gospel in the land: it seems unto me the approbation of that Bishop
that is also a Minister and preacher of the Gospel cannot be deemed to be
merely unlawful.

1. But what if the Bishops and Ministers he speaks of be not the Bishops and
Ministers of Christ, but of Antichrist? not in a true, but in a false
Ministry? not according to Christ's Gospel, but Antichrists apostasy? not
servants of Jesus Christ the only LOrd and head of his Church, but Lords
themselves over the Ministers and people under them? Will it not then seem to
Mr H. that the ordination receyved from them cannot otherwise be deemed but
merely unlawful? But such have they ben proved to be both in this and
Refucation of Mr Gyfford, printed, 1591. Discovery of the false Church, 1590.
Conferenes betvveen certain Preachers and prisoners. Confession of our faith,
etc.
other writings heretofore: to which it shall suffice to refer you and him
towching this matter. Or if for any prejudice against us he will not hear this
of us, let him yet hear and consider what themselves have written and
professed heretofore in this behalf. And let the controversy in this point be
debated between him and Mr Travers, Mr Cartwright, Mr Fenner, Mr Chaderton, and
all other that have sought Reformation.

Mr Travers in his Defense of eccles. discipl. page 88. 89. 90. 91.
book against D. Bridges proves by diverse good and sufficient reasons, that
their Bishops are neither Pastors nor Teachers. And what ordinari Ministry of
the Gospel then do they execute? As for extraordinary, the Prelates were not
known, when they were in the world: besides that they are as unlike them as
darkness is to light.

Mr Cartwright, striking at the chief and strength of their Ministry, that is,
at the Archbishops and Archdeacons, under whom the other Bishops and Ministers
execute their offices, proves that T C* first reply. page 8. and 88.
their functions are not in the word of God, but of the earth, new devised
ministeryes, and such as ca^ do no good Yea that the Archbishops office is the
neck of the popish Hierarchy, come out of the bottomless pit of hell.

Mr Fenner has Defense of godly Minist. against Bridges slanders. Page 111.
published, that if St Paul were now in England, and no greater man then he
was made by Christ, he might not be equal with these Bishops: For they are
spiritual Lords, he was never so: they might send for him by a pursevant, lay
him in the Counter or command him to the Fleet, so could not Paul do the least
Minister of the Gospel. Again he In the same book. page 123.
says, speaking of their offices, Our kind of Bishops, the Commissaryes, the
Archdeacons and such like, we account them no natural members of the body of
Christ's Church because they are of humane addition, not borne with her, nor
grown up with her from the cradle.

Mr Chaderton Sermon on Romans 1^. page 34.
writes that the callings of Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deacons,
Chauncelors, and all such be rather members and parts of the whore and
strumpet of Rome, then of the pure virgin and spouse of the immaculate Lamb.
And that they have no title nor interest in the Church as publik members, but
by the length of their unlawful svvords keep out lavvfull members of the body.

Finally, all the seekers of Reformation have in Admon. to Parlia. 2. treatise.
Sect. 14. 18. 20.
the Admonition to the Parliament professed, that the Names and offices of
Archbishops, Archdeacons, Lordbishops, etc. are together with their government
drawn out of the Popes shop, Antichristian, divelish, and contrary to the
Scriptures: That the Parsons, Vicars, Parish priests, Stypendaryes etc. be
birds of the same fether: And in a word (as has been noted before) that they
have an Antichristian Hierarchy and popish ordering of Ministers strange from
the word of God and the use of all well reformed Churches in the world.

Thus have they thought, and thus have they publisshed heretofore. Let Mr H.
therefore dispute the controversy with them. And if he or any other cannot with
pacyence hear the truth of us, let them yet be content to hear and take it in
good part at the hands of these men of whom they have no such prejudice. And
then see whether it have or can have so much as any color of truth; that the
Prelates should be Ministers of the Gospel: or that ordination may be receyved
from them, who are not members (much less officers) of the body of Christ's
Church: these men themselves being witnesses. (Not to speak here of the
testimony of former times: For which see the Act. and Monum. edit. 4. Page 150.
468. 562. 563. 639.
hystoryes of John Wickleff, William Swinderby, the Lord Cobham, John Claydon
etc.)

2. Secondly, let it hereupon again be noted, how wavering and unstable these
men are in all their ways: as if Jesus Christ were Yea and Nay, and not Heb.
13. 8. with 2 Cor. 1. 19. 20
one and the same yesterday, to day, and for ever. Heretofore they In their
treatises before alleged.
published that the Prelates were not Pastors not Teachers, nor members of the
body of CHRIST'S CHVRCH: but that their offices callings and government were
Antichristian, divelish, and contrary to the Scriptures. But now behold, they
account the PRELATES to be MINISTERS of the GOSPEL. Is it not piteous to see
them thus halt between two opinions: and to use such lightness in the matmatters
of God, as that their word should thus be Yea and Nay, and themselves like
reeds shaken with every wynd and clouds carried about with every tempest? Let
them take heed least whiles thus they dally with the Lord, he take them in
their own crafty^es and bring upon them that which is 2 Timothy 3. 13.
written, The evil men and deceyvers shall wax worse and worse, deceyving and
being deceyved.

3. Thirdly, see here again how they take for granted that which they should
prove: to wete, that the Prelates are Ministers of the Gospel. For this is the
point in controversy: they being charged not only not to be such, but to be
limbs of Antichrist, standing in 2 These. 2 3. 4.
apostasy from the way and Gospel of Christ: yea adversaryes against and
exalted above the Lord and his holy ordinances.

4. Fourthly, if they were true Ministers, yet it were an endless work (and
without all rule or example in the Scripture) for a man entering into the
Ministry to seek the approbation of all and every one of the Ministers of an
whole land. And yet if this were to be had, it would make the more against Mr
H. who would only seek for the approbation of some one (as here he reasonath)
d pass by all the rest of the Land, who notwithstanding by this means should
have as much interest therein as the other.

5 Lastly, it is to be minded here, how he turns away from the question and
matter in hand: telling us of approbation, when he should speak of ordination.
(...) ^rdination carry with it also an approbation of partly (...), yet every
approbation is not ordination: as Mr H. (...) very well. And hitherto of his
second (...) of it. Now follows his third and last: (...) there be any more
strength then in the former. The (...) fare these:

Thirdly ( says Mr. H.) the authority of the Christian Magistrate (without
whose liking and allovva^ce a Minister cannot be admitted to the (...) in
peace) coming to the Bishop by Act of Parliament, I may more boldly come to him
for his approbation in regard of the Law: not looking so much unto the Man, as
regarding with reverence the power of the Law and Christian Magistrate.

THis is Mr H. his third and last reason (as also the last words of his letter
that came to my hands): For answer whereof let it be remembered, how before in
his first reason he confessed (as the truth is) that the P^^lates by the Law
of God are not capable of this power and authority to ordeyn Ministers, which
is committed unto them by Act of Parliament: Yet notwithstanding here he says,
that in regard of the Law and Christian Magistrate he may more boldly come to
the Prelates for it. As if the authority of Man could make that lawful, which
God has made unlawful. What else is this, but to advaunce Man's Law above Gods,
and to exalt flesh and blood above the Lord himself: who is God over al blessed
for ever, Amen. Strange doubtless is that Ministry and fearful is that
standing, which cannot otherwise be vpholden then by making God (by whom
Princes reign) to stoop unto Man, whose breath is in his nostrils. The
Prophets, Apostles, and Christ himself have taught us otherwise, that Psalm. 2.
10. 11. 12. Deuteronomy. 28. 58. Esa. 66. 23. Zech. 2. 13. Luke 12. 5. Heb. 12. 28. 29.
all flesh even Kings and Princes as well as others ought to fear and tremble
before the great God of heave and earth, that all Psalm. 119 21.
they are cursed which do err from his ^ommaundements, and that Esa, 60. 12.
the nation and Kingdom which will not serve him, shall perish and be utterly
destroyed. Therefore should Mr H. either have showed this Law and ordinance of
the Magistrates to be agreeable to the Law and commandment of God (which he
does not): or finding it otherwise as himself confesses it to be, he should
with the Apostles have said and showed in his practice, that Act. 5. 29.
we ought rather to obey God then men. Otherwise if we were to receyve
whatsoever religion or whatsoever thing in religion is ordained by the Law and
Magistrate: what were this else, but to make thery State and kingdom such an
Idol as was Nebuchadnezars golden image and to exalt earthly princes above the
heavenly King and to annihilate the Testament of Jesus Christ confirmed in that
this precious blood?

If he except and (...) to help himself by this, that he speaheth here of
Christian Magistrates only, and not of Magistrates in general, he is
deceyved. For the power and nature of Magistracy (in whomsoever it be whether
Christian or Heathen) is Romans 13. 1 -- 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14. Tit. 3. 1. Mat. 22.
21. Esa. 49. 23. and 60. 2. Rev. ^1. 24.
one and the same: even the ordinance of God, appointed for the punishing of
them that do evil, and for the defense and comfort of them that do well. So
that although a Christian do and cannot but differ from an Heathen as towthing
the faith and religion they profess: yet as towching the nature and authority
of Magistracy they differ not. Neither has the one of them any more power then
the other, in religion to erect any other faith, Ministry, worship, or
constitution of a Church, then God himself who is King of Kings has ordained:
Or if they do, we are not bound to obey either of them thereyn: but always to
remember that we must yield obedience to Magistrates (whether Christian or
Heathen) only in the Lord. and never against the LOrd, Constantine the
Emperor had no greater nor other power and authority of Magistracy when he
became a Christian, then he had before when he was an Heathen: Neither might he
now any more the^ before add to, diminish, or alter the Laws and ordinances
of Jesus Christ. The same may be said of all others likewise. For the receyving
and profession of the faith of Christ gives not to Princes and Rulers any
power to refuse change or break his Laws and ordinances, which he as Lord and
head of his Church has commanded to be receyved therein: but it rather Psalm.
2. 10. 11. 12. Esa. 49. 23. and 60. 3. 2 Chronicles. 29 and 30. and 31. and 34. and
35. cap. Revel. 21. 24.
byndeth them so much the more, both themselves in their own persons to obey
and by their authority to command and draw their subjects also to yield
obedience to the Lord Jesus in his own ordinance, and no other.

Read the historyes of the Kings of Judah professing the faith of God: and see
if their authority of Magistracy gave them power any way to change the
religion and worship of God appointed by him for his Church at that time: And
whether both they and their people were not bound to submit unto it, and no
other. Insomuch as when As Vzziah, Achaz, Manesseh, etc. 2 Chro^. 26. and 28.
and 33. cap.
any of them attempted or did otherwise, they were sharply reproved and
grievously punished from the Lord. And contrarily, when As Asa, Iehoscha. phat,
Hezekiah, losiah, etc. 2 Chro. 15. and 17. and 19. and 20. and 29. and 30. and
31. and 32 and 34 and 35. cap.
they obeyed the voice of the Lord and followed his Laws and commandments
given by Moses, then did they and their kingdoms prosper through the blessing
of God. The same is to be brought and said of Christian Princes and Magistrates
at this day: Yea rather more of these then of the other, inasmuch as Christ
Jesus Heb. 3. 1. 2. 3.
the Apostle and high Priest of our profession has been faithful to him that
appointed him, even as was Moses in all his house: and being the Son is
covnted worthy of more honor the Moses the servant. Neither is it or can be
any disparagement hindrance or dishonor to Princes and Potentates for
themselves and their people to be subject to the Son of God and his
ordinances, who is King of kings and Lord of Lords, set at the right hand of
God the Father, having all power given him in heaven and in earth: But it is
and will be their greatest honor and benefit both in this life and in that
which is to come: even as their disobedience is and will be the contrary: as it
is Psalm 2. 10. 11. 12.
written, And now o Kings be wise, receyv instruction ye Judges of the earth:
Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice in trembling: Kiss the Son, least he be
angry and ye perish in the way when his wrath shall burn but a little:
Blessed are all that trust in him.

Thus have we seen the weakness likewise of this last reason alleged by Mr H.
for defense of his seeking and taking ordination at the Prelates hands. By
discussing whereof appears also, that who so will minister in the Church the
holy things of GOD, must be careful to have such entrance and calling thereto
as he has appointed in his word: And that otherwise to do, though it were upon
the commandment and appointment of all the Princes of the earth, cannot but
be sin against the Lord, who has Deuteronomy. 12. 32.
said, Whatsoever I command you take heed you do it, thou shall put nothing
thereto nor take ought therefrom: And contrary to that strait charge of the
Apostle to Timothy and all Ministers of the Gospel (towthing the Laws and
ordinances given by Christ to his Church) 1 Timothy 6. 13 -- 16.
saying, I charge thee in the sight of God who quickneth all things, and
before Jesus Christ which under Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession,
that thou keep this commandment without spot and unblameable, until the
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: Which in due time he will shovv that is
blessed and Prince only, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

And here now would we end this writing, but that it is needful in a word to
point at some other particulars mentioned by Mr H. in this last reason.

1 One is, that speaking of the ordination he took from the Prelates, he says
here he looked not so much unto the Man as to the Law: And yet in his second
reason before would have us beleev, he looked to the Man, that is, to the
Bishop as being a Minister and preacher of the Gospel, as there he alleges.
Thus still he forgets himself.

2. Another is, that having before in his first reason confessed that the
Prelates by the Law of GOD are not capable of this power to ordeyne Ministers
which is committed unto them by Act of Parliament, yet here he says he came
unto them for it, regarding with reverence the Law and Christian Magistrate.
Now how will he ever persuade this, that he could regard with reverence the
Law and Christian Magistrate, when by his own confession it seems he regard
not with reverence the Law of GOD and Christ himself? The Pro. 8. 15. 16. Rom
13. 1 -- 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. with Act. 4. 19. 1 Samuel 22 17. Mat. 22.
due reverence and obedience of the Magistrate does and cannot but depend upon
the reverence and obedience of God by whom Princes reign, and for whom they
are to be obeyed, not for wrath only but for conscience sake. Where this
therefore is wanting, how can the other rightly be had that depends upon it?
But of this enough has been said already. Only mark still his forgetfulness and
contradiction of himself.

3. Thirdly, where he grants, the Prelates have their power and authority by
Act of Parliament (Yea such power and authority as by the Law of God they are
not capable of): it may appear that themselves see this Prelacy and authority
thereof to be no ordinance of Jesus Christ, but an humane treature, the
ordinance and constitution of Man. Let them therefore as long as they will
plead for it, and for their Ministry receyved from and executed under it: Yet
in the end will be verifyed of it, as of all other the inventions of men in
Gods worship, that which Christ has long since foretold concerning them all
Mat. 15. 13.
saying, Alplanting which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted
up.

4. Finally, where he says that without the Magistrates liking and allowance
they cannot be admitted to the Ministry in peace; he now at length plainly
bewrays what it is indeed that moves them to receyv and join unto another
Ministry and worship then the Lord Jesus has ordained, and so to stand in
transgression against him and his holy ordinances: even the same thing, that
moved the (...) teachers to (...) circumcision among the Gentiles that had
receyved the Gospel, which the Apostle Gal. 6. 12.
says was, only because they would not suffer persecution for the cross
Christ: but would rather have the peace of the world though with brea^h of
Christ's ordinance, then the afflictions of the Gospel by yielding obedience
thereunto against the liking and allowa^^e of men Moses was otherwise minded,
who Heb. 11. 24. 25. 26.
choose rather to bear the rebuke of Christ and to suffer adversity with the
people of God, then to enjoy the treasures of Egypt or pleasures of sin for a
season: And the Apostles likewise, who Act. 5. 40 41. with 4. 18. 19. 20.
refusing to obey the rulers of Jerusalem that commanded them not to preach in
the Name of Jesus, and being therefore beat and ^courged, yet were glad and
rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for his Name: Yea and
Christ himself, who Heb. 2. 10.
being Prince of our salvation was consecrate through afflictions: and
requires likewise of all that will be followers of him, Mar. 8. 34.
saying, Whosoever will follow me, let him forshake himself and take up his
cross and follow me. And thus have the servants of GOD through his grace and
power ben minded and walked in all ages: howsoever these men now would seem to
have found a nearer and more easy way to the Kingdom of heaven. But let them
not deceyv themselves: Whatsoever they do or may think to the contrary,
certain it is as Christ has Mat. 7. 14. Luke 13. 24.
said, that the gate is strait and the way narrovv that leads unto life, and
fevv there be that find it.

Yet do we not deny neither, but it is to be accounted an happy Esa. 49. 23
Act. 9. 31. 1 Timothy 2, 1. 2 with Mat. 28. 20.
benefit and greatly to be desired, that the Church and people of God may have
rest and be suffered to lead a godly life in peace and quyetnes: keeping the
faith, order, commandments and statutes which our Lord Jesus has given and
appointed to his Church. But if this cannot be had in peace without
persecution, yet Psalm. 119 23. 59. 60. 6. 1 Timothy 6. 13 14 with 2 Timothy 2. 3.
12. 1 These. 1. 6. Romans 8. 17. 18. 35 -- 39. Rev. 2. 10. and 14. 12. 13.
must we not therefore refuse or turn from the way and commandment of
Christ, but set our feet therein notwithstanding, and always be ready to walk
through the midst of afflictions with joy in the holy Ghost, by the grace and
assistance of Christ our Lord: Knowing that if we suffer with him, we shall
also reign with him. For the momentane lightness of our affliction causes
unto us a far most excellent eternal weight of glory, while we look not on the
things which are seen, but on the things which are not seen: for the things
which are seen be te^porary, but the things which are not seen be eternal. 2
Cor. 4. 17. 18.

To God be praise and glory for ever.
Amen.

Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11. 12. If any man worship the beast, and his image, and
receyv his mark in his forehead or on his hand, the same shall drink of the
wine of the wrath of God, etc.

Here is the patience of the Saints: here are they that keep the commandments
of God and the faith of Jesus.


Some notes towching that form of prayer commonly called the Lords prayer.
FIrst it is certain, that the treasures of wisdom and knowledge being him in
Jesus Christ who set it down* it is a most perfect form and rule of (...): unto
which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be taken away. Col. 2.
3. Mat. 6. 9. 13. Rev, 22. 18. 19.

2. Therefore also no Angels or Men (who whatsoever they have, receive it of
his fulness) are ever able to atteyne to the setting down of the like Ioh. 1.
16. 1 Cor. 13. 9. Heb. 1. 6. 7.

3. If they do or shall set down any other form, we must not regard or follow
it, but keep our selves only to this rule which Christ our Lord has
prescribed. Mat. 6. 9 -- 13. and 15. 9. and 28. 20. with Gal 1. 8. 9.

4. In this, Christ has taught us, 1. to whom to pray, that is, to God only
and not to any Angel or Saint whatsoever: 2. with what affection, that is,
with faith and confidence of Luke 11. 11. 13.
his willingness to hear and help us as being our Father, and of Psalm. 115 3.
Eccle. 5. 1.
his ability thereunto (together with due regard of his Majesty) as being in
heaven, and therefore full of glory and able to do whatsoever he will: 3. For
what things, whether they concern Gods glory or ourown benefit, according to
the several occasions and necessityes which God ministers and lays upon us:
4. What difference we should make of the things and of our desire after them,
according to their several natures: 5. The end of all, that God in and over
all may be glorified.

All which directions are here comprised in few words, but such as fulls and
plainly teach and comprehend them all, even whatsoever is needful to be
known and observed in calling upon the Name of God, Hereupon it is that all
the prayers recorded in the Scriptures which the men of God upon ^o many
several occasions have offered up unto him are comprised in and may be reduced
to this form of prayer, although they did not use the very syllables and frame
of words here set down. By which also may be gathered, both that this is a most
absolute form and ^^le of prayer, and that the Of this judgment is Mr Calvin,
Beza, Vrsinus, Piscator and those of our own nation which translated the
Bible into English at Geneva: As may be seen in their notes, comme^taryes, and
expositions of this form of prayer, Mat. 6. 9 -- 13.
right use of it is to conceyve and frame all our prayers according to this
rule, and not to be bound to use this number of words, as many now a days in
their ignorance and superstition do imagine.

If it be objected, that Christ Luke 11. 2
said, When ye pray, say, Our Father etc. and therefore that we ought in
prayer to repeat these words: I answer first that the Scripture shows his
meaning was not at all to bynd us to the use of these syllables, but that in
prayer and thanks giving we should follow this direction and pattern which he
gave. So we read in Mat. 6. 9.
Matthew that Christ said, After this manner pray ye, and not (as men now would
habeit) Say over these words.

2. Secondly, seeing this is an absolute form of prayer wherein is no want or
vain repetition, if Christ's meaning were to bynd us to the use of these
words, why then should we use any other? why should we not allway use these,
and these only? Yea what else were it but vain bavling and intolerable
presumption to put other prayers in stead of this which is so absolute and
perfect?

3. Thirdly, it is to be minded that this form of prayer being reco^ded in
Mat. 6. 9. 13. Luke 11. 1. 4.
two places of the Scripture, there neither is all the same word, nor the same
number of words mentioned in both places. Now then, according to which of these
two must we say it? If according to Luke his recording of it, then shall we
offend against that of Matthew: and contraily: if we (...) t^ed to the number
and order of the words, as they are set down.

4. As God in giving the Moral law (albeit he did fully and shortly ^eclare
his will in those Exodus 20. 1^ -- 17. Deuter 5. 6 -- 21.
ten Commandments, yet) did not dynd the Prophets and Priests in their
Ministry to use those very words, but as occasion required according unto them
to show the people what then ought to do or leave undone: so Christ also giving
this foune of prayer (a^beit therein he has fully and shortly taught us all
things needful for prayer, yet) has not bound us in calling upon GOD to use
these words, but in all things according to this rule to make our requests
unto God, with giving of thanks.

5. It is without question, that the Apostles (unto whom this rule first was
given) were careful to keep it according to the true meaning of Christ But
they neither tied Act. 1. 2^ and 4. 24. Mat. 14. 30. 2. Cor. 12. 8. Ephesians. 3. 14.
21 Phil. 1. 9. 10. 11 Rev. 22. 20.
themselves to the sevvords but always prayed as they had several occasions
according to this rule, neither when they wrote unto Phil. 4. 6. Ephesians. 6. 18. 1
These. 5. 17. 18. Romans 15. 30 31. 3^ 2 These. 3, 1. 2 1 Ti. 2. 1. 2. 3. la^. 1.
5. 6. and 5. 13. 1 Pet. 4. 7. 1 Ioh. 5. 14. 15. Jude, ver. 20.
others concerning prayer, did they ever teach them to say over the Lords
prayer (which doubtless they would have done if they had so taken the will of
Christ to be) but they taught and exhorted them still according to their
necessityes and occasions in all things to show their requests unto God in all
manner prayer and supplication in the spirit with giving of thanks, and hereunto
to watch with all perseverance: because this is the will of God in Christ
Jesus.

6. If the Apostles had been bound or might have tied themselves to these or any
other set form of words, then had they not given a sufficient reason who (in
this respect with other) it was not meet they should attend unto the Deacons
office, because they would Act. 6. 2. 4.
give themselves [as to the ministration of the word so also] unto Prayer: For
it had been easy for them either to have said by rote or to have red o^t of a
book this or any other set form of prayer.

7. They which think Christ has tied us to say these words, and that such
saying of the words is true prayer, must reconcile herewith the Apostles speech
when he Romans 8. 6.
says, We know not what to pray as we ought, but the spirit it self makes
request for us with groans that can not be expressed. These men (it seems)
would answer, Yes we know what to pray, to wit, the Lords prayer, which
conteyneth whatsoever we need to ask: And what then need the Spirit to teach
us what to pray as we ought?

8. The Apostle (speaking of prayer in a stra^nge tongue) says 1 Cor. 14. 16.
thus, When thou blessest, how shall he that occupyeth the room of the
unlearned say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knovveth not what thou
speak? Now if they had be^ tied to the use of the words of the Lords prayer
or to any other set sunted words, they might have answered, Yes we know what
he says when he prays or gives thanks, It is the Lords prayer, or some
stinted prescribed prayer which we know aforehand, and therefore unto it though
it (...) spoken in a strange tong^e we can say Amen.

9 If the saying over of these or of any friend words were true prayer, then
might a man have his prayers by rote, or carry them in his pocket, or ^^y them
at the book bynders shop etc. Which were strange to imagine of true prayer,
which is the Romans 8. 26. 27. Ephesians. 6. 18. Jude, ver. 20 1 Samuel 1. 12. 15. lam.
1. 5. and 5. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 5.
work of Gods spirit in our hearts, teaching and enabling us to power out our
souls unto God in all necessityes and occasions, and so to offer up spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

10. Whenas Christ promises that our heavenly father will give the holy Ghost
to them that Luke 11. 13.
ask it of him: And else where speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem Mat.
24. 2^.
says, Pray that your slight be not in the (...), and the like: these things
being to be prayed for, and yet these words not set down in that form of
prayer, shows that Christ has not tied v^ to repeat over those words, but to
pray after that rule according to our wants and occasions.

11 The words are so general, as unless they be some way opened and
particularl^ applied, diverse men will diversely understand them. For example if
these words (Thy kingdom come) be used only in general without any
explication, the Papist understands them of the advauncement of Gods kingdom
in and by their religion, the Protestant understands and intends them of
the clean contrary: And so in the rest. Neither can any man for himself use
them aright without some special application to his particular estate and
occasion: because no one man's faith and understanding can atteyne unto all
things needful for all occasioins times and persons, as those words do
comprehend.

12. If these words (Say ye etc): must be taken and pressed according to the
letter, then would follow that in prayer we should always speak with the tongue:
Whereas there is prayer often in the spirit alone without any words or dis^inet
voice at all: As we Exodus 14. 15. Esa. 38. 14. Neh. 2. 4. 1 Samuel 1. 13. Romans 8.
26. 27.
read that Moses, ^ezekiah, Nehemiah, Annah, and others have so prayed and ben
accepted of God.

13. Christ has given an Luke 11. 2
express commandment (When ye pray say, Our father etc.) whereupon I reason
thus: The commandments of Christ are to be kept, otherwise it is sin:
therefore if Christ have here commanded to use these words in that number and
order, then whosoever pray at any time, and use not these words, they sin.
But already we have seen that the Apostles prayed and used not these words, and
yet sinned not. And so no doubt do other the servants of God daily according to
their diverse occasions and conditions: Not to speak here of the prayers which
the preachers use before and after their sermons, neither of their collects and
other prayers (besides this) prescribed in their books. Otherwise also every
man that blesses his table, or says to another, God be with you, God bless
you, God recover you, good morrow, good night, or the like, should sin in
this, because he prays and yet says not, Our father etc.

14. Yet I doubt not but we may use any of these as well as other words,
applying them to our special case and necessity: As we see that Christ prayed
Ioh. 12. 28.
saying, Father glorify thy Name, And Mat. 26 42.
again, O my Father if this cup can not pass from me but that I must drink it,
thy will be done, Where we may learn by Christ who gave the rule, how to use
it, to wit, not in a superstitious saying over these words, but in praying
according to this rule as our special necessities shall be, whether we use any
of these words or other, or pray with sighs that cannot be expressed.

15. Finally therefore all such as have framed or receyved any other form of
Prayer but this only which Christ has taught, offend against this rule and
commandment of Christ. And thus (not we, but) they who have devised and
follow other forms and books of prayer, are those which deny and (as much as
lies in them) disanull the Lords prayer.

^EVEN QVESTIONS which have been propounded to diverse of the M^inisters of these
assemblyes, with request that they would answer them directly and s^ncerely
from the Scriptures. Which also still is desired at their hands.
^ WHether the Lord Jesus Christ have by his last Testament given unto and set
in his Church, sufficient ordinary offices, with their calling, works, and
maintenance, for the administration of his ^oly things, and for the sufficient
ordinary ins^ruction guydance and service of his Church, to the end of the
world, or no?

2. Whether the offices of Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons and Helpers, be
those offices appointed by Christ in his Testament, as aforesaid? Or whether
the present ecclesiastical offices of Archbishops, Lordbishops, Su^^raganes,
Deanes, Subdeanes, Prebendaryes, Channcelors, Priests, Deacons or half Priests,
Archdeacons, Subdeacons, Commissa^yes, Officials, Doctors, Pro^tors, ^egisters,
Scribes, Apparitors, Parsons, Vicars, Curates, Stipendaryes, Dagrant preachers,
Chapleynes or house priests, Canons, Petticanons, Gospellers, Epistlers,
Chaunters, Virgerers, Queristers, Organ-players, Churchwardens, Sidemen,
Collectors, Clerks, Sertans, and the rest now had in these Cathedral and
parishionall assemblyes, be those offices appointed by Christ in his Testament,
as is aforesaid, or no?

3. Whether the calling and entrance into these ecclesiastical offices last
aforesaid, their administration, and maintenance, now had and retained in
England, be the manner of calling, administration, and maintenance, which Christ
has appointed for the offices of his Church above named, or no?

4. Whethere very true visible Church be not a company of people called and
separated out from the world and the false worship and ways thereof by the
word of God, and joined together in fellowship of the Gospel, by voluntary
profession of the faith and obedience of Christ? And whether the
ecclesiastical assemblyes of this land be such, or no?

5. Whether the Sacraments [being seals of rightuoesnes which is by faith] may
be administered to any other then the faithful and their seed, or in any other
Ministry and manner the^ is prescribed by Jesus Christ the Apos^le and high
Priest of our profession? And whether they be not otherwise administered in the
Cathedral and parishionall assemblyes of England at this day?

6. Whether the book of common prayer with the feasts, fasts, holy days (...)
prayers and leiturgy, prescribed therein and used in these assemblyes, be the
true worship of God commanded in his word, or the devise and in^ention of Man,
for Gods worship and service.

7 Whether all Churches and people (without exception) be not bound in religion
only to receyv and submit unto that (...), worship, and order which Christ as
Lord and King has given and appointed to his Church* Or whether any man receyv
and join unto another, devised by man, for the service of God? And
consequently, whether they which join to the present ecclesiastical
Ministry, worship, and order of these Cathedral and parshionall assemblyes,
can be assured by the word of God they join to the forme^ ordained by Christ,
and not to the latter (...) by (...), for the (...) and service of God?
