The great Cicle of Easter Containing A short Rule.

To know upon what day of the month Easter day will fall, made for the use of
such as would without their book readily find out, and declare as well Easter
day, as the other moveable Feasts in the year: the domincall letter, the
Epact the age of the Moon, her shining and the course of the tide. With other
necessary Tables to learn out the course of the year, By Io, P. 1583.

Ieremi. 10. 2. 3. Learn not the way of the heathen: And be not afraid for
the signs of heaven, though the heathen be a fraide of such, for the customs
of the people are vain. Gene. 8. 22. Hereafter seed time and Harvest, and
cold and heat and Summer and Winter, and day and night shall not cease so long
as the earth remains. Set forth according to the Queens Iniunctiones.

Jmprinted at London by I. C. for Thomas Butter.

To the Right Worshipful, and his special good friend Master William Roe
Alderman of London, John Pett Gentleman, wishes health and peace in Christ,
with increase of Worship. etc.
IT is an usual thing among men of our time, like as they have learned of the
former age, (Right worshipful and my dear friend) to express and make
manifest their good will toward such as they account most dear unto them, by
offering or presenting unto them, some fruit of their labor and study. Among
whom if I had persuaded my self, that the mind of the giver were not more
regarded and esteemed of men, then the moitie of the gift offered, I would not
presume to have any place. But being already sufficiently persuaded of your
good will toward me, diverse times and many ways heretofore expressed,
(though mine insufficiency to requite the least part of your friend ship would
hold me back* I have been bold under your name, as a defense to publishe
this little book, containing. A rule to find out Easter day and other
moveable feasts with the Domnicall Letter for ever. etc. Thereby minding to
witness unto all, how ready I am to show my self thankeful unto my well
willers, and friends Among which I account your worship not the least, by who^
I was also procured to set forth that, which otherwise for the smallnes and
simplenes thereof, I should have wrapped up in a paper, never to have felt the
Press. So that because you seemed desirous, that I should make that common,
which heretofore I had privately acquainted your worship withal. Being
persuaded that it would be well liked and accepted of some men, as you best
know. And also for that (as I perceived by an old table which I sometime found
in Ireland, made to the self same end.) This rule was practiced above 100.
years ago, as well, to satisfy your request as to correct that which was so
long ago attempted, and left very false and imperfect, I am bold to offer the
same unto you in such sort as I could in respect of mine other business,
conveniently rid it

out of my hands. Which is the cause that it is not so large as I had
sometime purposed. The use hereof I will not in many words commend especially
unto you, who knows best how far and to whom it is profitable, even for such
as would ease them selves of being always tied to their Almanake or Kale^der.
And would readelie know the days as well feasts as other, and such like
things, without the help of any Kale^der. And I will only desire you as my
special good friend. To take in good part my good meaning, in token of
thankefulnes toward you and of good will toward those that shall vouchsafe
their pains to peruse. God almighty bless you and yours, in or through his
Christ to whose safe protection I commend you. From my house at Seuenock in
Kent this.

Your friend to his power. Io. P.

To the Reader.
I Have been requested (gentle Reader) long ago to put in Printe this short
rule, for the ease of them, that would be cunning to know the chaungeable
course of the moveable feasts in the year. But being partly hindered by my
affairs in the world, and partly discouraged as well through the simplenes of
the work as also least I should seem to take from other men ye praise due to
their work, by intermedling their labor with my small skill. I have hitherto
slacked my hand, from that which willinglye I would have performed, until now
at the last being overcome with the persuasion and request of some, that
think it a thing needful as well for the ease of them, that always in their
affairs need the use of a calendar, as also for the quickening of the memory
of such young Scholars, as would readily, speak of the changeablenes of ye
years by the altering of Easter day and other festival days from one day of
the month to an other, I have put it forth, not minding to prejudice the work
of any man, who have heretofore published such tables, as hereto are annexed,
nor yet to offend their minds.

Therefore I would request thee (good Reader) to have patience and charitably
to judge of my travel herein, taken in hand for ye benefit of such as shall
employ some small time and labor to learn these few verses and rules without
the book, whom and whose labor I commend in my prayer to the blessing of God,
who turn all our endeavors to his glory. Seuenock this.

Thine in the Lord, Io. P.

A rule to find Easter.
BEfore thou enter into these verses (good Reader) know this, that thou have
no matter to behold in the course of these words. And I am right sorry that I
could not set down some good matter, either civil or divine, (such is mine
unskillfulness in Poetry, and in such things tam curta supellex) to occupy the
Reader withal. I therefore thought good to refer that to the better learned,
whom I would earnestly request to vouchsafe so much pains, as to new pen
these verses, so that the readinge thereof may minister some knowledge to the
dilligent Reader, besides the purpose for which they are now set down. And I
will (God so willinge) bestow the cost of the new printing of the^. Further
more whereas I have feigned some words beginning with K. and with Y. and have
set down and and. 2. for words and letters. Let him that can with better skill
devise some better course and take the commendacions due to his labor. I
shall be glad to see it accomplished. The Lord Jesus preserve us evermore.

A declaration of the meaning of these Verses.
BY these Verses which here are written with letters and figures, directly
placed over every word. You may know Easter for ever, whether it will be hye or
low, you may also know the Dominicall Letter, the leap year and the Prime
for every year, for over every word you shall find the Prime, and under the
Prime the Dominicall Letter, and when you find two letters together over one
word, that signifies the leap year, and the latter Letter is the Dominicall
Letter for that year.

These Uerses, may be called the Cicle of Pascha or of Easter, containing in
it self 532 years. At the end whereof Easter has his recourse to the first,
and so orderly keeps to the end of these Uerses again making hisreuolution
in the said 532. years.

And in this great Cicle of Pascha, may be numbered contained and multiplied
19. commen Cicles of the Sun, of the which every Cicle contains 28 years,
likewise in this great Cicle of Pascha may be contained numbered. and
multiplied 28. common Cicles of the Moon, every Cicle containing 19, years.
And therefore I have thought good to call it the great Cicle of Pascha for when
these Verses are ended and 532. years past and spent. Then must you return
and begin again with the first Verse Grande, Bonum, Tribus, etc. and with
the same number of the Prime and with the same Letter and so forth as you did
before.

Now to understand it more perfectly you must note that, the words of them
selves signify nothing, but the first and last letters of every word are only
to be observed, for the first letter signifies the day of the month. And the
last letter signifies the month. Every word ending in M. notes the month
of March. All other words wherein soever they end, do represent the month
of April, the first letter of every word shows the day of each month, And
because that Easter keeps his course from the 22. of March unto the 25. of
April and passes not those two days, therefore you must reckon the days by
letters thus beginning with. a bed. etc.

For example, when you have any word that represents April (which you must
know by the last letter of the word not being M. as I have showed) then the
first letter of that word if it be A as Amans signifies the first day of
April, if it be B. as Benefactis. it is the second day of April, if it be C.
as Cuius. it is the third of April, if it be T. as Tunc, then it notes the
19. of April. upon which day Easter day will be the next year, 1584.

And because we have 25. days in April to reckon upon, for that Easter day
falls sometime upon every of them. I am constrained to feign words beginning
with K. as Karitas, Karolus, and also with Y. as Ysus. Therefore if you find
Y. or the Greek v. to be the first letter of the word, it signifies the 22.
day of April, or if it be Z. it is always the 23. day of April.

Furthermore when you find and. by it self thus written and. and 2. by it
self so written, as I was constrained to take them for letters to make up my
number of 25. So must you take them for words, and. signifying the 24. of
April, and 2. signifying the 25. of April. And therefore before you, I have
set down my row of letters 25. in number,, with the days of April over
their heads according as each letter does note in the verses going before.

April. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20.
21. 22. 23. 24. 25. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. i. k. l. m. n. o. p. q. r. s. t. v.
x. y. z. and. 2.

As thus you perceive the letters of the Alphabet reckoning them for April, to
go forward: So contrary wise for March, you must reckon them backward, where
we are to reckon but 10. lettters to serve for 10. days of March, that is
from the 22. to the 31.

So that when you find a word signifying March, and that is when it ends in
M. Then if the word begin with A. as Aurum, it notes the 31. day of March on
which day Easter day was this present yaere 1583. if it begin with B. as Bonum,
that notes the 30. day of March, if it begin with C. as Coelum, that shows
the 29. day of March. As this row of letters with the number of the days of
March over their heads according as they signify in the Verses, shall declare.

March. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. k. i. h. g. f. e. d. c. b. a.

Remember always that the word must end in M to represent March, as is showed
you before.

Now the numbers and letters over every word, do show the Prime and the
Dominicall letter, for every year, like as every word includes a several
year, to show Easter day.

Furthermore, when you are come to this perfection by learning, and considering
these verses, that you can show from year to year, upon what day of the
month Easter will fall, and then would be desirous to tell also without book
what is the Dominicall letter any year. I have added here two verses in
Lattin and two in English (either will serve your turn) to help your memory,
to show what letter stands upon the first day of every month, so that
reckoning from the first day of the month unto the day upon which you find
Easter day to fall, you have the Dominicall letter. And so may ye call to
mind, what was the Dominicall letter many years past, to save the labor that
I have known some men to take, trudging up and down for Almanackes of 20. or
30. years past, only to know what was the Dominicall letter such years past.

These Verses are.
January. February. March. April. May. June. July. August. September. October.
Noue^ber. Dece^ber. Alta. Dedit. Dominus. Gratis. Benedicit. Egenis Grandia.
Christ. Facis. Astute. Doemona. Fugas.

Or thus in English.
January. February. March. April. May. June. July. August. September October.
November. December. Adam. Did. Disobediently. Grief. Bring. everlasting.
Grace. Christ. Foordeth. All. men. Diuellishnes. Forsaking.

In each two verses you have 12. words for the 12. months as they are marked
over the word, now every word begins with the same letter that stands
first in the month, as January begins with A. therefore I have said in the
verse Alta. So February with D. as Didit, and therefore in this Table you see
it more plainly.

January. A April. G February. D May. B March. D June. E

Iulie. G October. A August. C November. D September F December. F

To prove the use of this rule, I find in my former verses that the next
year 1584. Easter day will be upon the 19. of April, which I find by this word
Tunc the first word in the second verse, standing for the year. 1584. now I
would learn what shall be the Dominicall letter that year, which I know
stands upon the 19. of April, seeing it will be Easter day.

To know this I call my verse to my remembrance showing me the first letter
in April, which being the fourth in number, is represented by the fourth
word in my verse which is Gratis, so that G. is the first letter, then from
the first I reckon to the eight day and so to the 15. for look what letter is
the first day, the same letter is the 8. and 15. and 22. and 29. on which days
I find G. then from the 15. to the 19. day I reckon A. for the 19. B. for the
17. and C. for the 18. day, then D. standing for the 19. day is the Dominicall
letter because it is Easter day.

And the use hereof is further. As I have promised to be in York the 17. day
of May next coming in Anno. 1584. I would fainde know what day of the week
it is, either Sunday or Monday, etc. To know this I reckon from January to
May, which as I find to be the first month in number or in order, so I find
in like order in my verses that the first word Benedicit, begins with B.
which shows that B. stands in the Calendar for the first of may, then
reckon to the 15. and there B. stands, so that the 16. day is C. and the 17.
day is D. which will be on Sunday, because my former rule has proved it by
finding out Easter day the 19. of April, where D. also stands.

And as thus you may know what letter stands upon any day of any month: so
may you know what day every letter does stand for, etc.

A necessary Table to know Easter for ever.
THis Table I have here added not only for such as can not away with ye
tediousnes of learning my verses, but also, to prove whether these verses do
guide you a right to find out Easter day or no.

And this you must thus prove. Seek out the Prime or Golden number in the
first row or order down wards, for the year in which you desire to know
Easter day, then look out the Dominicall letter for that same year. And
directly underneath the Dominicall letter, and in the order where the Prime
stands, shall you find Easter day. As for example. I desire to know upon
what day Easter day will fall in the year 1585. I find ye Prime will be 9. the
Dominicall letter will be C. the^ underneath the letter and in the row where the
Prime stands I find the 11. of April which will be Easter day that year, in
Anno. 1586. I find the Prime 10. the Dominicall letter B. then underneath and
in the row where the Prime stands I find the 3. day of April for Easter
day, and so you find it out always, hereafter shall follow a rule to find
out the Prime or golden number when I come to speak thereof.

Here follows an other necessary Table, wherein is placed in your sight,
the mooueable feasts with their orderly courses according to the course of
Easter day, which being known the other will be easily borne in memory.
YOu know that there is between Shroue Sunday and Easter day, 7. weeks which
is 50. days. as for example Easter day being the 22. day of March, you must
have 28. more, which being taken out of February there will remain none, then
of necessity it must be the first day of February. Another, If Easter day be
the 25. day of April you must have 25. more which must be taken out of March
which will stretch to the 7. day of March which is Shroue Sunday that year.

This Table serves to know the mooueable Feasts.
IN the orders you have first for the Dominicall letter, in the second is
placed Shroue Sunday. In the third is Ashwednesday the first day of Le^t. In
the fourth order is Easter day. In the fifth is Rogatio^, in the sixth Penticost,
in ye last are numbered the weeks and days between the day of the Nativity of
our Lord, and Shroue Sunday. The use hereof is, when you once know upon what
day of the month Easter will be, which you have learned by your former rules,
the^ find out the same in this Table. And directly in ye same line you have
your move able feasts on both sides. As for example, when I find that Easter
day will be the 22* of March, the^ Shroue sundaie shall be ye first of February,
Ashwednesday shall be the fourth of February.

And as Easter day keeps from the twenty two of March to the twenty five of
April. So Shroue sunday keeps from the first of February unto the seventh of
March. Whitsunday keeps from the tenth of May unto the thirteenth of June. A
thing easily committed to memory if we remember but only the first day, of
each of the rows for what they stand for.

This rule is easily committed to memory, if you will mark it well, this every
one knows, that there is 7. weeks between Shroue sunday and Easter day
likewise from Easter to Whitsunday.

When you are come to the end of these 2. tables you must then beeginne again
as shall be showed.

A declaration of these two Tables.
THe one shows the Dominicall letter for every year, as well past as to come
which I have put down here to help such as cannot commit my former rules to
memory. And here note that when you have ended your course taking the
Dominicall letter in order down this Table, you may begin again, as also you
may go back to find out the yearly Dominicall letter past, which thing my
vearses will easily absolve, having the Prime and the Dominicall letter over
every word, as the years do succeed one an other.

The other Table serves to know the number called the Prime, and the number
called the Epact.

The Prime is a number that begins with 1. and increases yeerlie one tell
it come to 19. And then it begins with 1. again. This Table serves for such
as cannot skill of numeration but of those that have some taste of
Arithmeticke. This number may be found out thus, know the year of the Lord
wherein you would know the golden number. And add thereto one, then divide the
same by 19. take away the nineteenes and the remain is the Prime, if nothing
remain the^ 19. is the Prime. As the year 1584. I would know the Prime, I
add 1. and then is the number 1585. I divide it by 19. and there remain 9.
which is the Prime that year Another way more ready in this, cut of from the
year of our Lord 1500. And take the remain and divide that by 19. and the
remain of that shall be the Prime. As in the year 1580. I reserve 1500 so there
remains 80. I divide it by 19. and 4. remains for the Prime. In Anno. 1588.
I first leave 1500. and I take 88. when I have diuied it by 19. I shall leave
12. which will be the Prime that year.

To know the Epact do thus.
WHen you have found out the Prime or golden number multiply it by 11. and then
divide it by 30. The remain is the number of the Epact which you desire to
know.

And here you may also note that both the Prime and also the Epact make their
reuolutiones in 19. years, yet the Epact rises to 29. the Prime but to 19.
which thing is not to be doubted of though it rise from 1. to 29. and finisheth
his course in 19 years, if you consider this. That certain numbers there are
which never make the number of the Epact, as these 2. 5. 8. 10 13. 16. 19. 21.
24. 27. being in number 10. these never make the Epact. So that if you take
them away, then you shall leave but 19. to make the Epact which are these. 1.
3. 4. 6. 7. 9. 11. 12. 14. 15. 17. 18. 20. 22. 23. 25. 26. 28. 29.

VVhereto the knowledge of the Epact serves.
THe knowledge of the Epact serves to find out the age of the Moon, for when
you know the number of the Epact, you must reckon how many days of ye month
are past, wherein ye desire to know the age of the Moon, reckoning the
present day for one. Then the number of the months past beginning at March,
to the month present, reckoning March for the first, and your month present
for ye last, in which month you would be resolved of the age of ye Moon. Add
these 3. numbers put together vzt the Epact, the days of the month, and the
number of the months past. If these numbers put together arise not to 30.
then that number is the just age of the moon, if it exceed 30. then abstract
30. and the remain shows how many days the Moon is old.

For example I desire to know the age of the Moon, upon Christmas day next
coming, first I find the number of the Epact 17. Christmas day is the 25. of
December, from March to December are 10. Months then add all these. 3.
numbers together. The Epact. 17 The days of the month past, 25 The number of
the months past. 10
These numbers added together do amount to the number of -- 52
from which I substract 30. and the residue is 22, which is the age of the
Moon that day vzt 22. days old. And thus may you do any other time or day.

But if when you have subtracted 30. nothing shall remain, then it is the
chaung day.

Thirty days has November,
April, June and September:
February has twenty eight alone,
And all the rest has thirty and one.

BY this Table it will appear unto you how many hours ye Moon shines
through out the year. In the midst whereof is placed the age of the Moon,
and underneath are set 2. letters H. and M. signifying hours and minutes,
above are set the names* of the twelve months of the year. So that if you
desire to know how many hours the Moon shines at any time of the year.

You must look as well to the age of the Moon as to the month of the year,
wherein ye seek the age of the Moon. And directly you shall find how
many hours and minutes she shines, if the Moon be four days old, in
June for it makes no skill what day of June, then under the title of June, and
in the order or row that you find the Moon four days old you shall find
that she shines two hours, again the Moon being thyrteene days old in
December upon any day of that month, then look under the title of December,
and you shall perceive that she shines fourteen hours and eighteen
minutes. Whether it be the first the second third or last day of December, all
is if the Moon be so old. etc.

This Table might have been made somewhat less if I had placed January and
November together, and Februarye and October together, March and September
together, for that the Moon has a like order in them, but this is the
plainest way.

This declaration serves for the Table before.
Here for the benefit of and ease of such, as use the water to pass by tide
from out of Kent to London, I have in this Table drawn out the times as well of
the full Sea as of the low water. At Grauesende, at Eryth and at London. So
that if you would know the tide at any of these three places, thus must you use
this Table, first learn the age of the Moon: and in the same order ye shall
have the full Sea and low water at the place according to his title, by the
hour of the clock and minute which be also noted with H. signifying the hour
and M. the minutes.

In which Table you may learn what Moon makes the full Sea at the said
places, as at London a Southwest Moon makes a full Sea, at Grauesende South
Southwest Moon, at Erith Southwest and by South.
