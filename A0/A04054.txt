The Interlude of Youth.
Charity.

Youth.



Jesus that his arms did sprede
And on a tree was done to dead
From all perils he you defend
I desire audience til I have made an e^de
For I am come from God above
To occupy his laws to your behoue
And am named Charity
There may no man saved be
without the help of me
For he that Charity does refuse
Other virtues though he do use
Without Charity it will not be
For it is written in the faith
Q^im (...) in charitate in deo move
I am the gate I tell the
Of heaven that ioiful city
There may no man thider come
But of charyty he must have some
Or he may not come iwis
Unto heaven the city of bliss
therefore charity who will him take
Apure soul it will him make
Before the face of God
In the. A.B.C. of books the least
Yt is written deus charitas est
Lo charity is a great thing
Of all virtues it is the king
When God in earth was here living
Of chariti he found none endinge
I was planted in his heart
We two might not depart
Out of his heart I did spring
through the might of the heaven king
And all priests that be
May not live without charity
And charitey to them they do not take
they may not receive him that did them make
And all this world of naught

youth. A back fellows and give me room
Or I shall make you to avoid sone
I am goodlye of person
I am pereles where ever I come
My name is youth I tell the
I florysh as the vine tree
Who may be likened unto me
In my youth and Iolitye
My hearre is royal and bushed thick.
My body plyaunt as a hasel styck
Mine arms be both fair And strong
My fingers be both fair and long
My chest big as a tun
My legs v^foll light for to run
To hoppe and dance and make merry
By the mass I recke not a chery
What so ever I do
I am the heir of my fathers land
And it is come into my hand
I care for no more

Charity Are you so disposed to do
To follow vice and let virtue go

Youth. Ye sir even so
For now a days he is not set by
Without he be vnthriftye

Charity You had need to ask God mercy
Why do you so prase your body

Youth. Why knave what is that to the
Will thou let me to praise my body
Whi should I not praise it and it be goodli
I will not let for the

Charity what shall it be when thou shall flyt
For the wealth into the pyt
Therefore of it be not to boolde
Least thou for think it when ye art old
Ye may be lykened to a tree
In youth floryshyng with royallte
And in age it is cut down
And to the fire is thrown.
So shall thou but thou amend
Be burned in hell without end

Youth. Ye horson trowest thou so
Be ware least thou thither go
Hence caytife go the way
Or with my dagger I shall the slay
Hens knave out of this place
Or I shall lay the on the face
Say thou that I shall go to hell
For ever more there to dwell
I had lever thou had evil fare

Charity A yet sir do by my read
And ask mercy for thy misdede
And thou shall be an herytoure of bliss
Where al joy and myrthe is
Where thou shall se a glorius sight
Of aungeles singing with saints bright
Before the face of God

Youth. what syrs above the sky
I had need of a ladder to climb so hye
But what and the ladder slyppe
Than I am deceived yet
And if I fall I catch a quecke
I may fortune to break my neck
And that ioynte is ill to set
Nay nay not so

Charity O yet remember call to thy mind
The mercy of God passes al thing
For it is written by noble clerks
The mercy of God passes all works
That witnesses holy scripture sainge thus
Miseratio domin^ super omnia opera ^iu^
Therefore doubt not gods grace
There of is plenty in every place

Youth. What me think ye be clerkyshe
For ye speak good gibbryshe
Sir I pray you and you have any store
Soil me a question or ye cast out any more
Least when your conning is all done
My question have no solucion
Sir and it please you this
Whi do me^ eat musterd with salt fish
Sir I pray you soil me this quistion
That I have put to your descrecyon

Charity Thus question is but vanity
It longs not to me
Such questions to assoyle

youth. Sir by god that me dear bought
I se your conninge is litell or naught
And I should follow your scole
Sone ye would make a fool
Therefore crake no longer here
Least I take you on the ear
And make your head to ache

Charity Sir it falls not for me to fight
Nether by day ne be night
therefore do my counsel I say
Than to heaven thou shall have the wai

Youth. No sir I think ye will not fight
But to take a man's purs in the night
Ye will not sai nay
For such holy caitifes
Were wont to be thieves
And such would be hanged as hye
As a man may se with his eye
In faith this same, is true

Charity God save every christen body
From such evil destroy
And send us of his grace
In heaven to have a place

youth Nay nay I warrant the
He has no place for the
we nest thou he will have such fools
To sit on his gaie stools
Naie I warrant the nay

Humily Well sir I put me in good is will
Whether he will me save or spyll
And sir I pray you do so
And trust in god what so ever ye do

youth. Sir I pray the hold thy peace
And talk to me of no goodness
And soon look thou go thy way
Less with my dagger I the slaie
In faith if thou meue my hatte
Thou shalt be weary of thy part
Or thou and I have done

Charity Think what God suffered for the
His arms to be spread upon a tree
A knight with a spear opened his syd
In his heart appeared a wound wid
That bought both you and me

youth. Gods fast what is that to me
Thou dawe will thou read me
In my youth to lose my ioylitie
Hence knave and go thy way
Or with my dagger I shall the slaye

Charity O sir hear what I you tell,
And be ruled of my counsel
That ye might sit in heaven hye
with God and his company

Youth. A yet of God thou will not cease
Till I fight in good earnesse
On my faith I tell the true
if I fight thou will it rue
All the days of thy life.

Charity Sir I se it will none otherwise be
I will go to my brother Humility
And take good counsel of him
How it is best to be do therein

youth. ye mary sire I pray you of that
Me think it were a good sight of your back
I would se your heles hither
And your brother and you together
Fettred fine fast
I wis and I had the kay
ye should singe well away
Or I let you lose

Charity Fare well my masters euerychone
I will come again anon
And tell you how I have done

youth. And thou come hither again
I will send ye hers in the dyuels nam
What now, I may have my space
To iet here in this place
Before I might not stere
When the churl charity was here
But now among all this chere
I would I had some company here
I wis mi brother Riot would help me
For to beat charytye
And his brother to

Riot. Huffa, huffa who calls after me

My heart as light as the wind
And all on Riot is mi mind.
where so ever I go
But wot ye what I do here
To seek youth my compere
Feign of him I would have a sight
But my lyppes hang in my light
God speed master youth by my fate

youth Welcome Riot in the deuels way
Who brought the hither to day

Riot That did my legs I tell the
We thought thou did me call
And I am com now here
To make royal chere
And tell the how I have done

Youth What I wend thou had ben henged
But I se thou art escaped
For it was told me here
You took a man on the ear
That his purse in your bosom did fly
And so in Newegate ye did lie

Riot So it was I be shrewe your pate
I come lately from Newgate
But I am as ready to make good chere
As he that never came there
For and I have spendyng
I will make as merry as a king
And care not what I do
For I will not lie long in prison
But will get forth soon
For I have learned a policy
That will lose me lyghtlie
And soon let me go

Youth. I love well thy discrescion
For thou art all of one condicyon
Thou art stable and steadfast of mind
And not chaungable as the wind
But sir I pray you at the least
Tell me more of that ieste
That thou told me right now
Morouer I shall tell the
The mayre of London sent for me
Forth of Newgate for to com
For to preche at Ty^one.

youth. By our Lady he did promote the
To make the preche at the galowe tree
But sir how did thou escape

Riot Verily sir the rope brake
And so I fell to the ground
And ran away safe and sound
Be the way I met with a courtiers lad
And twenty nobls of gold in his purs he had
I took the ladde in the ear
Beside his horse I called him there
I took his purs in my hand
And twenty nobles therein I fande
Lord how I was merry.

youth. Gods foot thou did enough there
For to be made knight of the colere.

Riot Ye sir I trust to God all might
At the next cessions to be dubbed a knight

youth. Now sir by this light
That would I feign se
And I plight the so God me save
That a surer tolere thou shall have
And because gold colers be so good chepe
Unto the roper I shall speak
To make the one of a good price
And that shall be of warranty se.

Riot. Youth (...) pray the have a do
And to the ^a^^ene let us go

And the cost shall be mine

Yet thou shall have a wenche to kiss
when so ever thou will

youth. Mary Riot I thank the
That thou wylt be stowe it on me
And for the pleasure so be it
I would not charity should us mete
And turn us again
For right now he was with me
And said he would go to Humility
And come to me again

Riot. Let him come if he will
He were better to bide still
And he give the crooked laugage
I will lay him on the visage
And that thou shall se sone
How lightly it shall be done
And he will not be ruled with knockes
We shall set him in the stocks
To heal his sore shinnes

youth. I shall help the if I can
To drive a way that hang man
Herke Riot thou shall understand
I am heir of my fathers land

Does this gear please the.

Charity They please me well in deed
The more sorrow the more mede
For God said while he was man
Beati qui persecucione^ patifitur propter iusticia^
Unto his apostles he said so
To teach them how they should do

Sit down sir and take your ease
Me think these same were full meet
To go about your fair feet

But go hence with a merry song

Pride Let us begin all at once

youth. Now have at it by cocks bones
And soon let us goo

Charity Lo masters here you may se beforn
that the wede ouergroweth the corn
Now may ye see all in this tide
How vice is taken, and virtue set aside
yonder ye may see youth is not stable
But evermore chaungeable
And the nature of men is frail
that he wotteth not what may avail
Virtue for to make
O good Lord it is a pitiful case
Sith G^^ has lent me wit and grace
To chose of good and evil
that man should voluntarily
To such things him self apply
that his soul should spyll

Humily Christ yt was crucified and crowend with thorn
And of a virgin for^ than was borne
Some knoweledge send to me
Of my brother Charity

Charity Dear brother Humility

Where have ye be so long

humili. I shall do you to understand
That I have said mine euensonge
But sit I pray you tell me now
How this case happened to you

Charity I shall tell you anon
The fellows that I told you on
Have me thus arrayed

Humily Sir I shall undo the bands
From your feet and your hands
Sir I pray you tell me anon
Whether they be gone
And when they come again

Charity Sir to the tavern they begone
And they will come again anon
And that shall you see

humili. Then will we them exhort
Unto virtue to resort, and so forsake sin

Charity I will help you that I can
To convert that wicked man

youth. Abacke galantes and look unto me
And take me for your special
For I am promoted to hye degree
By right I am king eternal
Neither duke ne lord, Baron ne knight
that may be likened unto me
they be subdued to me by right
As servants to their masters should be

humyli. Ye be welcome to this place here
we think ye labor all in vain
wherefore your brains we will stere
And kele you a little again

youth. Say thou my brains thou wylt stere
I shall late the on the ear

And brought up at Hogs norton
By m^ faith it seems so
well go knave go

Charity Do by our counsel and our read
And ask mercy for thy misdede
And endeuer the for gods sake
For thy sins amends to make

Riot Hark youth for god auowe
He would have the a saint now
But youth I shall you tell
A young saint an old devil
Therefore I hold the a fool
And thou follow his scole

youth. I warrant thee I will not do so
I will be ruled by you two

Pride Then shall ye do well
if ye be ruled by our counsel
we will bring you to hie degree
And promote you to dignity

humili. Sir it is a pitiful case
That ye would forsake grace
And to vice apply

youth. why knave does it grieve thee
Thou shall not answer for me
when my soul hangs on the hedge once
Then take thou and cast stones
As fast as thou will

Charity Sir if it please you to do thus
Forsake them and do after us
The better shall you do

Riot. Sire he shall do well inowe
Though he be ruled by neither of you
therefore crake no longer here
Least thou have on the ear
And that a good knock

Pride. Lyghtlye se thou avoid the place
Or I shall give thee on the face
Youth I trow that he would
Make you holy or ye be old
And I swear by the rode
It is time inoughe to be good
When that ye be old

youth. Sir by my truth I the say
I will make merry whiles I may
I can not tell you how long

Riot. Ye sir so mote I thryue
Thou art not certain of thy life
therefore thou were a stark fool
to leave mirth and follow their scole

humili. Sir I shall him exhort
Unto us to resort
And you to forsake

Pride Ask him if he will do so
To forsake us and follow you two
Nay I warrant you nay

humili. That shall you se even anon
I will unto him gone
And se what he will say

Riot Hardely go on thy way
I know well he will say nay

youth. Ye sir by God that me dear bought
Me think ye labor all for naught
Wenest thou that I will for thee
Or they brother Charytie
Forsake this good company

Pride. Nay I warrant the
No master I pray you of that
For any thing for sake us not
And all our counsel rule you by
Ye may be Emperor or ye dye

youth. while I have life in my body
Shall I be ruled by Riot and the

Riot. Sir than shall ye do well
For we be true as stele
Sir I can teach you to play at the dice
At the queen's game and at the Iryshe
The Treygobet and the hasarde also
And many other games mo
Also at the cards I can teache you to play
At the triumph and on and thirtye
Post, pinion, and also aumsase
And at an other they call dewsace
Yet I can tell you mor and ye will con me thank
Pinke and drink and also at the blanke
And mane sportes mo

youth. I thank the Riot so mote I the
For the counsel thou haste given me
I will follow thy mind in every thing
And guide me after thy learning

Charity youth leave that counsel for it is naught
And amend that thou have myswrought
That thou may save that God has boughte

youth. what say ye master Charity
what has God bought for me
By my troth I know not
whether that he goes in white or black
He came never at the stues
Nor in no place where I do use
Iwis he bought not my cap
Nor yet my ioylie hat
I wot not what he has bought for me
And he bought any thing of mine
I will give him a quarte of wine
The next time I him meet

Charity Sir this he did for the
When thou wast bond he made the fre
And bought the with his blood

youth Sir I pray you tell me
How may this be
That I know I was never bond
Unto none in England

Charity Sir I shall tell you
When Adam had done great trespass
And out of paradise exiled was
Then all the soles as I can you tell
Were in ye bondage of the devil of hell
Till the father of heaven of his great mercy
Sent the second person in Trinity
Us for to redeem
And so with his precious blood
He bought us on the roode
And our souls did save

youth How should I save it tell me now
And I will be ruled after you my soul to save

Riot What youth will you forsake me
I will not forsake thee

humili. I shall tell you shortly
Kneel down and ask God mercy
For that you have offended
Youth will thou do so Pride

Follow them and let us go
Marye I trow nay

youth. Here all sin I forsake
And to god I me betake
Good Lord I pray the have no indignacion
That I a sinner should ask salvation

Chariti Now thou must forsake pride
And all Riot set aside

Pride I will not him forsake
Neither early ne late
I wend he would not forsake me
But if it will none otherwise be
I will go my way

youth. Sir I pray God be your speed
And help you at your need

Riot I am sure thou wylt not forsake me
Nor I will not forsake thee

youth. I for sak you also
And will not have with you to do

Riot. And I forsake the utterly
Fie on the caytife lie
Once a promise thou did me make
That thou would me never forsake
But now I se it is hard
For to trust the wretched world
Fare well masters euerycheone

Humili For your sin look ye morn
And evil creatures look ye turn
For your name who makes inquisition
Sayt it is good contricion
That for sin does morn

Charity Here is a new array
For to walk by the way
your prayer for to say

humyli. Here be books for your devotion
And keep you from all temptacion
Let no vice devour
When ye se misdoing men
Good counsel give them
And teach them to amend

Youth. For my sin I will morn
All creatures I will turn
And when I see misdoinge men
Good counsel I shall give them
And exhort them to amend

Charity Than shall ye be an heritour of bliss
Where all joy and mirth is

Save all this fair company
Men and women that here be
