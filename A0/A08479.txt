THE ORATION AND PROPOSITIONS made on Barnavelt's and his Fellow Prisoners
behalf, by the French Kings Ambassadors, to the general Estates of the united
Provinces of HOLLAND, etc. at the presenting of his Majesty's Letters unto the
said Estates.
MY Lords, the King our Master commanded us, to recommend unto you the same
which we have heretofore at other times motioned, touching the good, and peace
of your estate: although it has not bin considered according to the
worthiness of the merit of his alliance and amity: but in the present state
of your affairs, his Majesty will not cease to witness unto you, that he
has no less care thereof, then of the peace and tranquillity of his own
Kingdom.

We will therefore proceed to exhort you, to continue steadfast in the union of
your Provinces, as the principal foundation of your estate, and to be
careful, that the changing of Magistrates and Counselors, which has bin made
in diverse of your Towns, do not breed enmities and dissentions among your
Citizens, instead of ceasing them; for that, all mutations and changes of
Magistrates, Laws, and policies are dangerous to public gouernements, if
they be not made upon great necessity, and so profitable for the Commons, that
no man may have cause to dislike them: Therefore it is requisite for you to
take order, that the Magistrates, by their good and just proceedings and
behauiours, may obtain and deserve the good will of the people; and show
themselves so modest toward them that are dismissed, that the inconstant
multitude may have no occasion to repine at such alteration; and that those
that have bin deposed from their charges, should patiently endure and bear
that alteration, as being made for the common good of the state.

The Sinode which you have caused to be assembled, puts us in good hope that it
will be a means to procure peace and concord touching those points of
Religion, which have bred trouble and schism in these Provinces among you: To
make it effectual and fruitful, it is requisite that it should be free, and
secure for all those that shall therein assemble together, and that the points
in controversy should be examined and disputed of, without passion, or for any
other consideration, then only for the honor of God, and the peace of men's
consciences.

And certainly, whosoever takes upon him to interpret, or attain unto those
high mysteries and treasures of divine wisdom, without great humility and
submission; shall find himself as far off from them, as he thinks he
approaches near unto them.

We are likewise to tell you somewhat from the King, touching your Prisoners,
and to show you, how much it concerns the honor and reputation of your
affairs, and generally the peace of your Provinces, and concord among your
subjects, to administer unto them good and speedy Justice. They are accused of
the most inorme and detestable crimes that can be, as of Treason against their
native Country, secret intelligence with your enemies, and for having exposed
your Towns unto the danger of pillage, and effusion of blood.

If they be culpable of these disloyalties, the King our Master gives you
counsel and advise to exercise the rigor of your Laws against them. But as
those crimes are grievous, and worthy of most great punishment; so they have
been reduced to certain points, whereunto good and wise Princes, and well
governed commonwealths would not stretch them.

To the contrary, diverse Princes have showed themselves ready to pardon, even
such enterprises as have bin done against their own persons: and the freest
Commonwealths, always used to spare the blood of their Citizens; and that in
the greatest malefactors; it being one of the principallest signs of liberty
and freedom, not easily or lightly to touch the life of Citizens.

Therefore the crime of Treason ought to be taken and understood in her proper
terms, without drawing it by consequences and inductions to other actions
which are not of the same quality. The contentions which oftentimes arise and
are made in the management of affairs, the iealousies of power and authority,
and ambition which always draws and drives men to enterprise and take more
upon them then they should, are ordinary evils in all states; whereby many
inconveniences and mischiefs ensew. Nevertheless, they were never esteemed
nor held to be treason against the State, because crimes and offenses are
judged by the will and intent, and not by the event.

We doubt not, my Lords, but that in your integrities and wisdoms you make
distinction as you should, of the faith and actions whereof men are accused;
question being made of the lives of your officers and subjects placed in
authority, whereof one is the auncientest Counselor of your state, which is
Monsieur Barneuelt, so much commended for the good and notable services by him
done for these countries, whereof the Princes and States and allies unto the
same are witnesses, that it is hardly to be thought or believed, that he should
have conspired treason against his native Country, for the which you your
selves know he has taken so great pains: nevertheless seeing he is called
in question by order of Law, it imports the security of your estate, that the
truth should be known; which to do, you ought both for him, and the rest also
to appoint Judges that are neither suspected nor passionate, that judge
according to the Laws of the Country, upon clear and evident proofs, as
equity requires, and not upon conjectures and presumptions, which oftentimes
deceive Judges; because there are many things that are apparent and very
likely, which nevertheless are not true; and others that are true, and yet
have no likelinesse thereof: and so by moderate and upright Judgment, you
shall manifest unto the world, that you are worthy of the possession and
commandment of this estate, to the government whereof God has called you.

The counsel which the King gives you, touching these Prisoners, is, not to
use rigor against them; but rather favor and clemency, as most acceptable
unto God, and fit and convenient to win the hearts of the people, and to make
them obedient. It is the security of States, such as yours is, to reunite your
subjects which are divided, and to molefie and appease the dislikes and
bitterness, which is among them; whereunto we have special charge to add his
Majesty's request and recommendation, in respect of the interest which he has
in the preservation of your State, and his knowledge of the great services,
which this Prisoner has done for you; as also of the affection; which he
always bare to the maintenance of the alliance between France and this State,
so notable actions and testimonies of his loyalty and fidelity, that they
seem to exclude all suspicion of treason and disloyalty; and whereof as yet,
his Majesty cannot hold or think him to be culpable, until by evident proofs
you make the crime manifest unto him.

Now after so many good aduises, which are on the Kings behalf propounded unto
you, if you, for your parts, rather choose a rigorous course, his Majesty shall
have sufficient glory and satisfaction, to have, like a true friend and allie,
given you wholesome and sound counsels, whereof the use and event will be as
happy and profitable for your State, as the contrary is hurtful and dangerous:
And his Majesty cannot choose but be much offended at the small respect which
you still make of his counsels, requests, and amity, which thereby may procure
as much slacknesse, as in times past you have found promptness and
fauourablenesse in your need. In the Hague, presented to the States.

Signed, de Thumerie, and, du Morier.

The general States answer to the Propositions, made unto them by the French
KINGS Ambassadors.
THe STATES general of the united Provinces, having in open assembly, heard,
and deliberately perused the Propositions of Messieurs do Boissise and du
Morier, Ambassadors of the most christian King of France, delivered by word of
mouth the 12 of this month, and the next day in writing, by virtue of their
Letters of Credit, bearing date the 28. of November. signify and declare, that
as they have had nothing in more singular recommendation, then by the
vprightnes of their actions and governments, to give all good means and
occasions unto his Majesty, to move him to continue his royal favors and
aides (following the example of the late King, of immortal memory and
incomparable wisdom) unto them, for the good and maintenance of their
Commonwealth: to the which end also, they have always carefully, in their
need, sought for and embraced his wholesome counsels, aduises, and favors,
against the threatenings, devises and powers of their enemies, for the which
they are obliged to give and yield all kind of thanks and gratefulnes unto
his Majesty and kingdom: So they are exceedingly much grieved, to perceive
themselves to be mistaken, and taxed, not to have resolved upon the affairs
done for them upon occasion of these last motions, touching the good of this
State, according to the merit of his alliance and amity, because they cannot
conceive whereupon this complaint of dislike should be grounded; in regard that
they have always had a special care, most exactly to observe and keep all
the points, and Articles of Covenants, which they have had the honor to have
contracted and renewed with his Majesty, not once neglecting any clause
thereof, whereby the least cause or occasion of coffeehouse, or jealousy
might grow or arise; and therefore the said States, assure themselves, that
continuing the same course for the security of their state, which hitherto
they have carefully held and observed, in the strict amity, and confederation
wherewith the two Kings consequently have vouchsafed to honor him, his
majesty will not at this present make any other construction of their wills,
and present carriages, then that which is requisite to be made of a state which
is most thankful for, and memoratiue of, his favors and benefits, and no
less desirous to show the continuance of the most strict bond thereof, in all
respects which shall be thought or found to be profitable for the service of
his Majesty, and convenient for their own security.

Nevertheless the said states, receive and accept of, (as a most great favor)
the good and wholesome counsels which it pleases his Majesty to give them,
in this present estate wherein their affairs now stand, exhorting them to
remain firm and constant in the union of their provinces, because they are
altogether conformable to their intents; for they have always had the same
desire and design, specially to be careful of the means to preserve and
defend their state against their enemies, and to use their friends and Allies
worthily, according to their quallities and degrees.

They also say that they have not without great and good consideration been
moved to change certain of their Magistrates, in some of their Towns: whereof
it may be, the report has been otherwise spread abroad, then the case
requires, seeing that the remedy was most necessary and easy being wisely and
moderately applied, without any violence or danger of bloud-shedding, in such
manner that public authority, union by peace, and assurance against disorders
are entirely established, which certain ambitious and factious spirits would
have much altered, not without great danger, (if longer forbearance and
patience had been used) to overthrow and destroy all the state, and to the
ruin and desolation of good men, and to the prejudice of his Majesty, and the
good of his kingdom.

Besides that, they have only made a necessary change of some certain
persons, not once thereby touching or altering the laws, rights or policies
of their Towns; neither have they had any other intent or meaning in their
elections of new Magistrates, then only to cease the great partialities that
have crept in among them, by the practice of factious persons, which in those
Towns and families proceeded so far as to erect Alter against Alter: and in
the same changes they have placed none but such persons as are well quallified,
faithful, and affected to their Country, who without doubt, by their upright
and just behavior, know full well how to procure and get the good will of the
people, and to preserve and defend the State from all violent alterations or
motions; and that in many Towns the proof of this lenity already appears,
in that the order which has been reeffablished for the protection and defense
of Innocents, against the first oppression, is already notable and pleasing,
whereby all the members of this State conspire and consent together to cast off
and abandon their bad motions, and to raunge themselves under lawful
obedience, by voluntary acknowledging of their superiors: And that if this
proceeding of their factious subjects had drawn them unto any greatextreamity,
they would hopefully have relied upon the ordinary good will of his Majesty,
for their support and means, which might have failed them, by their power to
have redressed those confusions, which by the mercy and goodness of God they
did in time prevent, without trouble or extraordinary charge to their allies.

Touching the Sinode, which has been called and assembled together in these
Provinces, they always certainly believed, that thereby some means of peace
and concord concerning, those points of religion which have bin the cause to
administer trouble in the Churches of some of their Provinces, would be found,
esteeming it the most meet, ancient, and lawful means thereunto, used in the
primative Church, even in the time of the Apostles: But what means soever they
have heretofore used to obtain and publish that convocation, it was never till
now in their power to attain to that holy and wholesome remedy, to rule and
stop the differences in their first birth: And his Majesty may well call to
mind and remember, if it pleases him, the entreaties and humble motions
diverse times made by them unto him, to be aided and assisted in this good
work, by the assistance of some of his subjects, chosen out of the reformed
Churches in his Realm; but were crossed and put off by them, with a small
number of persons, who contrary to all reason and order of government,
neglecting their vocation, outwardly made the just labor of the said States
unfruitful: but now nevertheless that by the goodness of God, and the most
wise and resolute conduction and dexterity of the Prince of Orange, they have
assured their temporal state from present danger, they thought it not
convenient to neglect the care which they ought to have of the Spiritual: To
the which end, the Sinode was freely opened, and began to be holden in the
Month of November last, as they desired, with this only prescription and
clause, not to seek any other thing thereby, then the honor of God, and the
peace of men's consciences, in the purity of his word, wherein there is found
and assembled so great a number of excellent persons, both for piety and
uprightness, chosen and appointed thereunto by their superiors, that the
States have good cause to hope well of their labors; and that also, by Gods
holy grace, the event will testify their just and sincere intentions, to the
contentment of his Majesty, the good and peace of their commonwealth, and the
confusion of the authors of this faction.

Further the said State also esteem, weigh, and think very well of the
reasons and considerations formerly set down by the said Lords Ambassadors,
in favor of the Prisoners, to administer unto them good and speedy Justice,
and to use them favorably, if they have not conspired the ruin of their
State, with their enemies: but for that the said States have been continually
busied about settling the necessary security of their commonwealth, which had
been greatly shaken by the violent proceedings of such as aspired to novelties,
by alteration of Religion, Justice, and fundamental Laws of all polliticke
orders: and that otherwise this conspiracy grew so great, that nothing was
exempted from the infection thereof, they thought it not convenient to run
headlong upon such a process of so great importance, and that first it was
most fit severally to gather and collect all such evidences as might tend unto,
and concern the same, for their full instruction therein, clearly to make
known and manifest the grounds and depth of the cause, and that such delay
could not be any ways hurtful or prejudicial to the Criminells, if they
presumed to have any advantage to justify their innocence. Notwithstanding,
there has not therein bin any loss of time, but things have bin done orderly
and diligently, and have already proceeded so far, that they are persuaded
that judgment shall not long be deferred, and such without doubt, that at the
publication thereof, all their allies, which affect the prosperity of this
State, and specially his Majesty, who is a just and virtuous Prince, will
commend their upright dealing, when they shall be better informed of the state
of the conspiracy.

In the mean time, they desire the said Lords Ambassadors, to assure his
Majesty from them, that they will incline themselves so much to clemency and
favor (whereunto they, and the condition of their government are naturally
addicted) as equity, justice, and the preservation of their State, may in any
wise permit them: Hoping that his Majesty (in regard of the cause) will not be
persuaded to prefer the important and ill-grounded solicitations of certain
particular criminels, or of their favorites, before the general interest of
the dignity and worthiness of this Commonwealth; but to the contrary persuade
themselves that his Majesty will find it more expedient for his service, and
the good of the said Provinces, to refer the same to the said States
government and judgment, which they will take pains to conclude and finish,
with so much equity and clemency among themselves, that the obedience of
their subjects shall by their authority be confirmed, and with so great wisdom
and respect of their allies, that his Majesty shall have occasion to content
himself with the duty which they will show for the observation and maintaining
of his alliance with them, whereof they will truly yield him satisfaction.

Given in the Hague at the general assembly of the said States. Seven

Seven ARTICLES propounded by Adrian du Bourg.
1. THat Originall-sinne, is no sin, but an occasion of Sin. 2. That the
great Mercy of God, is the only cause of man's good, and that he has power to
accept or refuse it. 3. That Faith, by the virtue of Gods great mercy, is the
proper work of man. 4. That Gods providence is such, that it foreseeth all
things, but works not in men particularly, whom he leaves to their
free will. 5. That the faithful or believing Children of God, in this life,
may perfectly accomplish Gods commandments, although they do them not. 6.
That the Children of God may fall from his grace and saving mercy, and so be
damned. 7 That the original cause of Justification before God, is the passion
of Christ, but the works of Obedience are the first original cause of this
Justification.
The Duke D'Espernons revolt and pernicious Designs, truly displayed and
reprehended by one of his Friends.
IT is true, and a common saying, my Lord, that those which use to play, before
they begin, should be sure to make a good match: it is the same advise which
you your self gave to a turbulent spirit, that sought the disquietnesse and
ruin of France: an advise which you suggested to be convenient, by the
knowledge that you had, that those who seek to set upon and conspire against
their King, in the end come by the loss, I mean both of honor and life: And
nevertheless forgetting your own instructions, and the examples which time
has produced; you are now fallen into the same crimes, which formerly you
abhorred, and thereby become disobedient and rebellious: Crimes, so much the
more to be blamed, as they are committed by a person, who not only ought to
shun them, but to the contrary, is obliged and bound by all manner of duties,
to employ both his body and goods against those that enterprise them. I am so
much grieved at your proceedings, that it moves me boldly without difficulty
to tell you, (being culpable as you are) that my advise is, and instantly I
beseech you, to seek out means to cure your malady, and to procure your own
safety, and therein to take my counsel, haueing heretofore given you warning
of your former actions, at the least, I shall discharge my self of the duty
which I owe unto you, for the favors I have received at your hands, and I call
heaven to witness of my sincerity; let me then entreat you, to peruse these
few lines, and suffer the truth therein by me set down, to work some remorse
of conscience in you. Upon what do you think, I beseech you, when you
discharge your arrows against the Kings Majesty, and the peace of his estate?
you that have both the grace and honor to be one of the officers of his
crown, and have as much charge and commodity as any other about him? This is
not the way, by waxing elder, to grow wiser, but rather to counterfeit the Ape,
which the older it grows, the vnhappier it is. What? in a manner having one
foot already in the grave, to damn his own soul, and disobay the King? and
not only to disobay him, but to offend him, in the dearest thing that he has,
and not only to offend him therein, but to take upon you to raise his Subjects
to bear arms against him under light pretenses, as the truth well shows; I
neither know, nor can conceive, how a man esteemed to be wise, whose beard is
gray, and seems to be of a stayed judgment, should fall into so great folly;
pardon me for speaking so freely: A Canker must be lanched and cut away, your
evil is no less, and most dangerous. You are not ignorant, that Kings are the
images of the living God, that their wills and commandments are Laws to be
specially observed, and that no man can dispense therewith, without being
guilty of high treason, both divine and humane, and yet, you have not only
ventred to disobey them, but also by a manner of new interpretation, have
directly withstood his commandments. The King thought your personal presence
to be necessary in Metz, and you thought the contrary, and that your abode
there would not like you, though you were appointed thereunto; his Majesty
desired your service in those parts, and you would perferre certain particular
affairs, to satisfy your own pleasures and inclinations, as if we were at
the Romans Saturnals.

You must grant me this, that there are no examples for your proceedings, and
that if in times past, there were rebels and disobedient Subjects, they always
sought to dissemble, and to cover and hide their pretenses with necessity: you
use not any such means, but are rather more hardened, and seem directly and
openly to oppose your self against his Majesty: What punishment think you
does such a crime deserve? One fault willingly and most commonly draws on
another. What have you done since you came from Metz? You have borne away the
Kings Mother, and carried her to Angoulisme, where you spread the ensigns of
revolt, and there determine upon war, and the subversion of the State? What
audaciousnesse is this, and whatan enterprise have you undertaken, to
circumuent the intents of a good Mother, toward her dear Son; to trouble
and set at variance the harmony and consent of their wills; to shake, and as it
were to break the bond of nature, and violently to pull out of so great a
Princes breast, the love which she owes to her Son, to her King, and to him
that specially loves her? Miserable man, (if I must needs use this term)
what is your pretense? To ruinate his Majesty's affairs, and to overthrow and
subvert the public peace of the Land? It is the conceit of a frantic
brain, governed by the author of malice: Do you not think and persuade your
self, that reason once taking place, but that the Queen will condemn your
pernicious designs, and the proceedings that you have caused her to use? there
is no doubt thereof, your forces cannot altogether break and dissipate the
principal motions of her suggestions, which are Nature and the fear of God,
able and sufficient to drive away the clouds and fictions wherewith you serve
your turn: The common people, manifestly see it, and curse you, as often as
they behold and look into the evils which you bring upon them: They know that
his Majesty is a most Christian Prince, that he loves his Mother perfectly
well, and that he never gave any just cause to procure this evasion: They are
assured and otherwise comforted, that this separation cannot continue long:
Their mutual desire already is to see one another, and to show the effects of
their reciprocal loves: Expect not then to fortify the weakness of your
cause, by the detention of the Queens person; you shall never have the consent
of her heart and will, to the ruin of the State, and her own glory.

But this is not all, I must begin again, and lead you to the execution of
that which this burning fever enduceth in your fantasy. You have disobayed,
and allienated (as you pretend) the Queens intents, you must now blame the
government both within and without the Realm, and in all places proclaim
war, and the desolation of your Country; wherein specially your design
cannot take effect. Foreign Princes honor, and too much desire the amity and
alliance of our Monarch; they have seen miracles, as it were, in his actions,
and that in his young years, with a manly and resolute generositie, he has
danted the monsters of his Realm, and by an admirable care and wisdom,
procured peace to those that had war; which is the cause, that by a general
consent they give him the glorious title of the Arbitrator of Christendom; and
his amity is so desirable and profitable, that such as are admitted thereunto
(how far distant soever they be) sleep and take their rests, without any
apprehension of trouble; how then will they understand your clamours, unless
it be to blame and condemn them?

The peace that we enjoy, is an evident testimony of the piety, justice, and
providence of our King; and therefore it is impossible that your inventions
should destroy the truth, and that which we see with our own eyes, in such
manner, that if in long time, there has been a happy reign in France, it is
now at this present, where all Orders and degrees are seen to flourish; Virtue
therein is commended, and Piety (the true support of the State) particularly
adored, where our King is as it were, a perfect model; Ecclesiastical persons
are reverenced, and called to counsel in his Majesty's most important
affairs, they enjoy and possess their revenues without trouble; the Nobility
are loved and respected; Justice is indifferently and without fear executed;
the Commons are not oppressed nor charged with Subsidies or new impositions;
and all estates together, have nothing so much in recommendation, nor so dear,
as this good King, for whose health and prosperity they daily make their
fervent prayers unto God. How then should they be moved to offense? and that to
accommodate your humors, they should set fire on their houses, and ruinate and
spoil one the other, after that to expect nothing else but misery in this
life, and damnation in the life to come?

I know assuredly, that you specially build your designs upon the inconstancy
of the popularity, as if the consideration of your person, or of any others,
were of more importance unto them, then the Kings, and their own preservation:
Therein you are deceived; the love and obedience that they bear and owe unto
him, are by Gods own finger engraven in their hearts, with a caracter
impossible to be defaced, and your name is execrable, as the sworn enemy of
their good: they openly report and say, that it is impossible that he which is
wicked and cruel against his own children, should ever be good to others; that
he which seeks the ruin and subversion of his native Country, unworthy of
human society: that the poison of your venomous heart has long time
appeared, and that it ought and should be choked in the birth; that the spots
and uncleanness of your soul, and the counsels which your actions have
imposed upon it, makes you play the last act of your Tragedy. To conclude and
be short, they are willing to contribute and give fire and faggot to consume the
author of so many mischiefs. I disscribe all these circumstances unto you
without flattery, to let you see the state whereunto your affairs are reduced.

Tell me now, who has brought you to these extreamities? Is it the
coffeehouse of the Queen? she had no other but that only which you have
procured; and say that she had, does it belong to you to intermeddle with the
difference that is between Princes? It is not like that of yours: The Son and
the Mother would soon have agreed together, and good endeavor would have
reduced all things to their true ends: Therein you are twofold culpable; one
by showing your evil will; the other by seeking to set division between the
Son and the Mother, the Subject and the King, and a love which could not be
broken, but by the impiteous winds of your sinister counsels.

It may be, ye will allege that you are none of his Majesty's
priuie-Counsellours, and your honor is such that you would know all, that you
may enterprise much; let us reason boldly: The counsel which the King now
has, is the same that his Father had, who by his valorous actions, and wise
conduction, was called the wonder of Kings: That great King, made profit of
men's actions, and perfectly understood the minds of his subjects, and yet he
neuer-made you privy to the counsel of his most important affairs: He was
content to do you good, and to continue you in the Offices that you enjoyed;
must you then complain, that the King his son, and successor in his
virtues, follows the same course and counsel, by the aid and dexterity
whereof, he had given us a general peace, and almost a golden world? Believe
me, rather praise and commend that good King, who in a manner had buried in
oblivion the memory of that which you know, and which I dare not touch,
fearing to offend his indulgence: I leave it to the registers of the Court of
Parliament.

Is it possible that you should be discontented, that his Majesty affects,
and does good to some one of his Seruitors, more then to you. I think you are
not at that point; for what other should that then be, but to show your self
unthankful for, and to condemn that which Henry the third did for you? He
loved you most particularly, and gave you all that you enjoy, besides 8000.
Franks yearly reuenews. This your great fortune, was much enuyed, and many men
spoke thereof, to your prejudice, which reason denied: I remember that some in
respect of you said, that men in Kings hands, are like unto Counters which they
make to value as much as they think good: And that there was never any
Monarch, but that showed some proofs of particular affections, which in truth
are Royal actions, worthy of commendation. And it is no small good, to a great
Prince, to make a good choice of, and to have faithful seruitors about him,
with security and familiarity, to whom he may discover and disclose his
heart, and thoughts: Every one of us see it by experience, and find nothing
more pleasing and acceptable, then to impart and unfold our affairs unto, and
with those whose affections and amities are well known unto us. Our King
loves with great judgment, he knows and will acknowledge the merit and
fidelity wherewith he has bin served; I mean, the more he (specially) whom
he loves, has amiable quallities and worthy the estimation of a King. I will
not particularize them, nor proceed further in this subject, only I will say,
that we must hold all that for Law, which pleases the Prince, and that for
their sake, we must love those whom they love, much less ought we to envy
and hate them: It should in truth be a most hard thing, and without all
likelihood or appearance of reason for Subjects to impose laws to their
sovereigns, and to master their pleasures and affections, they themselves
being free in their own particular houses, to love and to do good to those to
whom they will; and I say further, that the favor and fortune whereof we
speak, alters not that which is due unto Princes, neither yet abateth any
thing of the advantage and estimation of the Nobility, nor uses any violence
or evil entertainment toward others, whereby we may truly say, that no man
can nor may dislike or contradict it, but only of mere envy, the sworn enemy
of all good actions, and of the advancement and greatness of virtuous men.

This is the Table or Portraiture which I thought good to set before your eyes,
without dissimulation, to let you see the greatness of your faults, and the
extremity whereinto you are fallen. It may be you will be grieved that I
display them so openly; I protest that I have not set them all down, and that
without doing wrong to you, and to mine own intent, I could not say less. My
purpose is herein to set down sufficient to persuade you to the truth, and to
search the wound to the bottom, to the end, that having any feeling, you your
self may seek how to heal it; you should do it while time serves: This is
the advice which I will give you. A Lamp goes out if you put too much
moisture unto it; acknowledge that your too great estate has reduced you to
this point of great loss, and not yours only, but your childrens, whom you
cruelly drew into your rebellions. Kings have Iron arms; for Gods sake stay
not till our King lifts up his, you will surely be broken in pieces with the
blow; prevent it by humility, certainly his Matesty is just and benign; he
punishes and exterminateth obstinate Rebels, but he pardons those that ask
mercy and forgiveness. It is the only haven wherein you shall find hope of
relief, refer your self with a good heart freely unto his bounty, and you
shall not be deceived in your expectation.

Suffer the Queen to be at liberty to reunite and join her affections with
her Sons; let your children be suerties and pledges of your liberty, let
them fall down at his Majesty's feet, to protest and warrant your amendment,
and your most humble submissions to full fill all obedience in time to come:
Discharge your Soldiers, and let every place sound the praise of so complete a
Prince, and your resolution to die in his service. I am without doubt
persuaded, that this proceeding will be acceptable unto him, and that following
the example of Henry the great, his father, he will embrace and preserve you.
What glory (my Lord) will it be unto you to have appeased the wrath of so
puissant a Prince? To have of your self reobtained his favor? To have
pacified the tumult which you had raised in his Realm? To have procured peace
to your own soul, and rest unto your latest days, and to have reestablished
the state and fortunes of your Children. I beseech God gine you grace earnestly
to think upon these things, and to put them in effect: I desire and wish it
more then any other, that I may see you restored, and have the means hereafter
to say, as I have hither done that I rest

Your most humble and most affectioned servant, L: S. D.
From Paris the 28. of March, 1619. Stilo nouo.
