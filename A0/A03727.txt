The book of Codrus and Mynalcas.

The prologe of the fourth Eglog of Alexander Barcley.
COdrus a shepherde / lusty gaye and stout
Sat with his wethers / at pasture round about
And poor Mynalcas / with ewes scarce fourtene
Sat sadly musyng / in shadow on the grene
This lusty Codrus / was cloked for the rain
And double decked / with hoodes one or twain
He had a pautner / with purses manyfolde
And surely lyned / with silver and with gold
Within his wallet / were meats good and fine
Both store and plenty / had he of ale and wine
Such fulsome pasture / made him a double chynne
His furred myttans / were of a curres skin
Nothing he wanted / longyng to clothe and fode
But by no mean / would he depart with good
Sometime this Codrus / did under shadow lie
Wide opyn pipyng / and gapyng on the sky
Sometime he daunced / and hobbled like a bear
Sometime he pried / how he became his gear
He lept / he song / and ran to prove his might
When purse is heavy / oftyme the heart is light
But though this Codrus / had store enough of good
He wanted wisdom / for naught he understood
Save worldely practice / his treasure for to store
How ever it came / small force made he therefore
On the other side / the poor Mynalcas lay
With empty belly / and simple poor array
yet could he pype and finger well a drone
But sour is m^syke / when men for hungre groan
Codrus had richesse / Mynalcas had co^nyng
For god not gives / to one man every thing
At last this Codrus / espied Mynalcas
And soon he knew / what manner man he was
For old aquayntance / between them erst had been
Long time before / they met upon the grene
And therefore Codrus / down boldly by him satte
And in this manner / with him began to chatte.
Finis prologe.
Here begins the fourth Eglogge / of the behauour of rich men anenst
poets / interlocutours / be Codrus and Mynalcas.


Codrus first speaks. ALhayle mynalcas / now be my faith well met
Lord Jesu mercy / what troubles did ye let
That this long season / none could the here espy
With us was thou wont / to sing full merely
And to lie pipyng often time among the flouers
What time thy bestes / were fedyng among ours
In these cold valeys / we two were wont to bourde
And in these shadows / talk many a merry word
And often were we wont / to wrastell for a fall
But now thoudroupest / and have for gotten all
Here was thou wont / sweet balades to sing
Of song and dytie / as it were for a king
And of gay matters / to sing and to endyte
But now thy courage is gone / and thy delight
Trust me Mynalcas / now plainly I espy
That thou art weary / of shepherdes company
And that all pleasure / thou semest to dispyse
Lothyng our pasture / and feldes in likewise
Thou fleest solace and every merry fytte
Lesyng thy time / and sore hurtyng thy wit
In slouthe thou slombrist / as buried were thy song
Thy pype is broken / or some what else is wrong.

Mynalcas. What time the cock crows / feathers mout and fall
from sight she lurketh / her song is gone withal
When back is bare / and purse of soyne is light
The wit is dulled / and reason has no might
A due endityng / when gone is lyberte
Envy to muses / is wretched pouerte
What time a knight / is subget to a knave
To just or tourney / small pleasure shall he have.

Codrus. What / no man the keeps / here in captiuyte
And busy labor / subdueth pouerte
And often is it better / and much surer also
Assubget to obey / than at frewyll to go
As by ensample / behold a wanton colt
In ragyng youth / lepeth over hill and holt
But while he skippeth / at pleasure and at will
Oftyme does he fall / in danger for to spyll
Sometime on stubbes / his hofes sore he tears
Or falls in the mudde / both over heed and ears
Sometime all the night / abroad in hayle or rain
And often among breres / tangled by the main
And other peryls / he suffers infynite
So mengled with sorrow lis pleasure and delight
But if the same colte / be broken at the last
His sytter rules / and him refrayneth fast
The spur him pricketh / the bridell does him hold
That he can not prau^ce at pleasure where he would
The ryder him rules / and saves from dangere
By which example / Mynalcas it is clear
That frewyll is subget / to inconuenyence
Where by subgection / man voydeth great offense
For man of himself / is very frail certain
But often a ruler / his folly does refrain
But as for thy self / thou have no cause parde
To walk at pleasure / is no captiuyte.

Mynalcas. See thou not Codrus / the feldes round about
Compased with flodes / that none may in nor out
The muddy waters / nere choke me with the styuke
At every tempest / they be as black as ynke
Pouerte to me / should be no disconfort
If other spepherde / were all of the same sort
But Codrus / I clawe often where it does not ytche
To se ten beggars / and half a dosen ritche
Truly me thinks / this wrong particion
And namely sith all / ought to be after one
When I first behold / these feldes from a far
Me thought the^ pleasant / and void of strife or war
But with my poor flock / aprochyng nere and nere
Always my pleasure / did less and less apere
And truly Codrus / sith I came on this ground
Often under flowers / vile snakes have I found
Adders and todes / and many vile serpent
Enfect old sheep / with venym violent
And often be the young / infected of the old
That unto these few / now brought is all my fold

Codrus. In some place / is another venym nor serpent
And as for my self / I feel no grievous sent.

Mynalcas. It were great marueyle / wherso great ground is seen
if no small medowe / were pleasant sweet and clean
As for the Codrus / I may believe right well
That thou no savor / nor stynke of mud dust feel
For if a shepherde / has still remained long
In a foul prison / or in a stynking gong
His poores with ill air / be stopped ^o echone
That of the air / he feleth small sent or none
And yet the dwellers / be badder than the place
The rich and sturdy / does threten and manace
The poor and simple / and such as came but late
And who most knows / him most of all they hate
And all the burden / is on the asses back
But the strong caball / stands at the rack
And such be assigned / sometime the flock to keep
Which scante have so much / of reason as a sheep
And every shepherde / at other has envy
Scant be a couple / which loves parfitely
Ilwyll so reigns / that braulyng be thou sure
Constrained me nere / to seek a new pasture
Save only after / I hope of better rest
Forsmall occasyon / a bird not changes nest

Codrus. Well ere thou granted / that in a small ground
Some plot of pleasure / and quiet may be found
So where of herdes / assembled is great sort
There some must be good / than to the best resort
But leave we all this / turn to our point again
Of thy old balades / some would I here full feign
For often have I had / great pleasure and delight
To here recounted / such as thou did endyte.

Mynalcas. ye other shepherdes / which have enough at home
When ye be merry / and stuffed is your womb
Which have great store / of butter / chese / and woll
your cowes vthers / of milk replete and full
Payles of sweet milk / as full as they be able
When your fat disshes / smoke hot upon yor table
Than laud ye songs / and balades magnify
If they be merry / or written craftily
ye clappe your hands / and to the making hark
And one say to other / lo here a proper warke
But when ye have said / naught give ye for o pain
Save only lauds / and plesaunt words vain
All if these lauds / may well be counted good
yet the pore shepherde / must have some other fode.

Codrus. May thou not sometime / thy fold and sheep apply
And after at leysar / to live more quyetly
Dispose thy wits / to make or to endyte
Renou^syng cures / for time while thou do write

Mynalcas. Needs must a shepherde bestow his hole labor
Inte^dyng his flocks scant may he spare one hour
In going / coming / and often them to tend
Full lightly the day / is brought unto an end
Sometime the wolves / with dogs must he chase
Sometime his foldes / must he new compace
And oftyme them change / and if he storms dout
Of his sheep cote / daube the walls round about
When they be broken / oftymes them renew
And hurtful pastures / note well and the^ eschew
Bye straw and lytter / and hay for winter cold
Often greas the scabbes / as well of young as old
For dread of thieves / often watch up all the night
Beside this labor / with all his mind and might
For his poor house hold for to provide vitayle
If by adventure / his wolle or lambs fail
In doing all these / no respyte does remain
But well to endyte / requires all the brain
I tell the Codrus / a style of exellence
Must have all labor / and all the dilygence
Both these two warkes / be great nere importable
To my small power / my strength is much unable
The one to entende / scant may I bide the pain
Than is it harder / for me to do both twain
What time my wits / be clear for to endyte
My daily charges / will grant me no respyte
But if I follow / endyting at my will
Echone disdayneth / my charges to fulfill
Though in these feldes / each other ought sustain
Clean lost is that law / one may require in vayue
if coin command / than men count them as bound
Else fle they labor / than is my charge on ground.

Codrus. Cornix often counted / that man should fle no pain
His friends burden / to support and sustain
Feed they thy flock / while thou do write and sing
Each horse agrees / not well for every thing
Some for the charet / some for the cart or ploughe
And some for hackeneys / if they belyght and toughe
Each field agrees not well for every sede
Who has most labor / is worthy of best mede.

Mynalcas. After endityng / than gladly would I drink
To reche me ye cup / no man does care ne thike
And often some foles / void of discrecyon
Me and my matters / has in derisyon
And marueyle is none / for who would sow yt field
With costly seeds / which shall no fruits yield
Some wanton body / often laugheth me to scorn
And says Mynalcas / se how thy pyltche is torn
Thy hose and cokers / be broken at the kne
Thou can not sto^ble / for both thy shone may se
Thy berde like bristels / or like a porpos skyn
Thy clothyng shows / thy winnyng is but thyn
Such mockyng tauntes / renews often my care
And now be wodes / of fruit and leaves bare
And frosty winter / has made the feldes white
For wrath and anger / my lyppe and tongue I byte
For dolor I droupe / sore vexed with disdain
My womb all wastes wherefore I bide this pain
My woll and wethers / may scarsly feed my womb
And other household / which I retain at home
Lean be my lambs / that no man will them bye
And yet their dammes / they daily souke so dry
That from their vthers / no lycour can we wring
Than without repast / who can endyte or sing
It me repents / if I have any wit
As for my science I weary am of it
And of my poor life / I weary am Codrus
Sith my hard fortune / for me disposes thus
That of the stars / and plannettes echone
To poor Mynalcas / well fortunate is none
Known is the truth / if it were clearly sought
That now to this time / I still have song for naught
For youth is lusty / and of small thing has need
That time to age / men give no force nor head
Ages condycion / is greatly contrary
Which no we aprocheth / right still and craftily
But what time age / does any man oppress
if he in youth / have gathered no richesse
Than passes age / in care and pouerte
For need is grievous / with old infyrmite
And age is fettred / oftyme with care and need
When strength is faded and man has naught to feed
When strength is faded / than hope of gain is gone
In youths season / to make prouisyon
The little emet / is wise and prouydent
In somer workyng / with labor dilygent
In her small cave / conueying corn and grain
Her life in winter / to norisshe and sustain
And with her small mouth / is busy it cuttyng
Lest in her cave / the same might grow or spring
So man of reason / him self reputyng sage
In youth should puruey / to live thereon in age.

Codrus. Men say that clerks / which know astronomy
Know certain stars / which long to desteny
But all their saying / is nothing veritable
yet here the matter / thought it be but a fable
They say that Mercury / does poets favor
Under Jupiter / be princes of honor
And men of richesse / of welthe or dignyte
And all such other / as have authorite
Mercury gives / to poets laureate
Goodly co^ueyaunce / speech plesaunt and ornate
Inuentyfe reason / to sing or play on harp
In goodly dytie / or balade for to carpe
This is thy lotte / what sekest thou richesse
No man has all / this thing is true doutlesse
God all disposes / as he parceyueth best
Take thou thy fortune / and hold the still in rest
Take thou thy fortune / and hold thy self content
Let us have richesse / and roumes exellent.

Mynalcas. Thou have of richesse / and goods habundaunce
And I have dyties / and songs of plesaunce
To ask my connyng / to couytous thou art
Why is not thy self / contented with thy part
Why do thou enuade / my part and portion
Thou want Codrus / wit and discrecyon.

Codrus. Natso Mynalcas / forsothe thou art to blame
Of wrong enuasyon / to give to me the name
I would no dytie / nor balade take the fro
No harp nor arms / which long to Appollo
But only Mynalcas / I sore desire and long
To give mine ears / to thy sweet sou^dyng song
It fedeth heryng and is to one pleasant
To here good reason / and balade consonant.

Mynalcas. if thou have pleasure / to here my melody
I grant the Codrus / to toye my armony
So I have pleasure / and toye of thy richesse
So gifts doubled / increases love doutlesse.

Codrus. He of my richesse / has joy which loves me
And who me hates / nothing content is he
Enuyous wretches / by malice commonly
Take others fortune / and pleasure heuely.

Mynalcas. In like wise may thou / enjoy of our science
And of our muses / though thou be fro presence
And of our connyng / thou toyest semblably
if ought provoke the / by malice and envy
if I feed thy ears / feed thou my mouth again
I loathe were to spend / my gifts all in vayue
Meat unto the mouth / is fode and susteynance
And songs fedeth / the ears with plesaunce
I have the muses / if thou will have of mine
Than right requires / that I have part of thine
This longs to love / to norisshe charity
This fedeth pity / this does to right agree
This is the pleasure / and will of god above
Of him disposed / for to engendre love
All plesaunt gifts / one man has not parde
That one of other / should have necessite
No man of him self / is sure sufficient
This is prouisyon / of god omnipotent
That one man should need / another assystence
Whereby is joined / love and benevolence.
England has clothe / Butdeux has store of wine
Cornwayle has tynne / and Lymster wolles fine.
London has scarlot / and Bristo we plesaunt reed
Fenne land has fyss hes / in other place is leed.
This is of our lord / disposed so my brother
Because all costs / should one have need of other.
So every tree / has fruit after his kind
And diverse natures / in beestes may we find.
Always when nature / of thing is most laudable
That thing men cou^teth / most good and profitable
And every person / in his own gift has toye
The fool in his babble / has pleasure for to toye.
The clerk in his book / the merchant in richesse
The knight in his horse / harnes and hardynesse.
But every person / of his gifts and art
When need requires should gladly give someperte
Such mean contoyneth / in bond of love certain
England and France / Scotla^de Greece and Spain.
So have thou Codrus / of gold enough in store
And I some co^nyng / though few me^ care therefore
Thou art beholden / to Jupiter truly
And I beholden to plesaunt Mercury.
Join we our sterres / let me have part of thine
Co^corde to cheryss he / you shalt have part of mine
Make thou Jupiter / be frendely unto me
And our Mercury / shall be as good to the.
If thy Jupiter / give me but only gold
Mercury shall give the / gifts manyfolde
His pylsion ceptre / his wings / and his harp
If thou have all these / thou may grathly carpe
And over all these / give the shall Mercury
The knot of Hercules enlaced craftily.

Codrus. Lord god Mynalcas / why have you all this pain
This wise to forge / so many words in vain.

Mynalcas. That vain you cou^test / which may hurt or enlesse
Thy loved treasour / or mynisshe thy richesse
If thou will harken / or here my musessyng
Refress he my mind with confort and lyking
Rydde me fro troubles and care of business
Confort my courage / which now is confortlesse
A clerk a poet / combyned with a boy
To haunt the muses / has but little joy
The wit and reason / is dull or of valor
Like as the body / is called to honor
Whau busy charges / causes a man to groan
The wit than slombreth / and muses all be gone
A dytie will have / mind quiet and respyte
And case of stomach / else can none well endyte
I sighe / I slombre: care troubles often my thought
When some by malice / mine art sets at naught
I heule as a kyte / for hunger and for cold
For thought and study / my youth apaereth old
My skin has wrincles and pomples all about
For cold and study / I dread me of the gout
When sickness comes / than life has breuyte
By false unkindness / and wretched pouerte
If men were loving / benign / and charytable
Than were pouerte / both good and tolerable
But sith charity and pity both be gone
What should pouerte remain behind alone
No man has pity / each dayneth me to feed
I lost have confort / but still remains need
I have no wethers nor ewes in my fold
No silver in purse / I know not what is gold
Nor corn on the ground / have I whereon to fare
Than would thou have me to live void of care
Nay nay friend Codrus / trust me I the assure
Such manner salues / can not my dolor cure
Make thou me ioconde / help me with clothe and fode
Clothe me for winter / with pylt^he / felt / and hode
Avoid all charges / let me sytte in my sell
Let worldly wretches / with worldly matters mell
Socour my age / regard my heeres gray
Than shake thou prove / and se what thing I may
Than shalt thou find me / both apt to write and sing
Good will shall fulfill / my scarsnesse of co^nyng
A plentyfull house out chaseth thought and care
Soiorne does socour there / where althing is bare
The sellar couched with bear / ale / or wine
And meats ready when man has lust to dyne
Great barnes full / fat wethers in the fold
The purse well stuffed / both with silver and gold
Favor of friends / and such as loves right
All these and other do make the full light
Than is it pleasure the young maidens among
To watch by the fire / the winter nights long
At their fond tales / to laughe or when they brall
Great fire and candell / spendyng for labor small
And in the ashes / some plays for to make
To cover wardeyns / for faut of other warke
To tossed white sheuers / and to make prophytrolles
And after talkyng / oftymes to fill the bolles
Where welthe abounds / without rebuke or crime
Thus do some herdes / for pleasure and pastyme
As fame reports / such a shepherde there was
Which that time lived under Mecenas
And Titerus I trow / was this shepherdes name
I well remember / a live yet is his fame
He song of feldes / and tyllyng of the ground
Of sheep / of oren / and battle did he sound
So shirle he sounded / in terms eloquent
I trow his tunes / went to the firmament
The same Mecenas / to him was fre and kind
Whose large gifts / gave confort to his mind
Also this Shepherde by heavenly influence
I trow optayned his perelesse eloquence
We other shepherdes / be greatly dyfferent
Of commen sorts / lean / ragged and rent
Fed with rude frowyse / with quacham or with crudde
Or slymy kempes / ill smellyng of the mudde
Such rusty meats enblyndeth so our brain
That of our favor / the Muses have disdain
And great Appollo / dispyseth that we write
For why? rude wits / but rudely does endyte.

Codrus. I trust on fortune / if it be favorable
My trust fulfylling / than shall I well be able
Thy need to socour / I hope after a thing
And if fortune fall well after my lyking
Trust me Mynalcas / I shall deliver the
Out of this trouble / care / and calamyte.

Mynalcas. A Codrus Codrus / I would to god thy will
Were this time ready / thy promise to fulfill
After the power / and might that thou have now
Thou have enough for both man / god auowe
If thy good mind / according with thy might
At this time present / you should my heart well light
I ask not the store / of Cosmus or Capell
With sylken robes / I coueyt not to mell
No kings dysshes / I coueyt nor desire
Nor rich mantels / or palles wrought in tire
No clothe of gold / of Tyssue nor velvet
Damask nor saten / nor orient Scarlet
I ask no value of Peter's costely cope
Shield of Mynerua / nor patyn of Esope
I ask no palace / nor lodging curyous
No bed of state / of raiment sumptuous
For this I learned of the deane of Poules
I tell the Codrus this man has won some souls
I ask no treasour / nor store of worldely good
But a quiet life / and only clothe and fode
With homely lodgyng / to keep me warm and dry
Enduryng my life / for sorthe no more ask I
If I were certain this lyueng still to have
Avoid of trouble / no more of god I crave.

Codrus. This lyueng have thou / what needs the compain?
Nothing you want / which may thy life sustain
What feel man parde / thy chekes be not thynne
No lack of vitayle / causes a double chynne

Mynalcas. Some be is lusty / and fat of his nature
Though he sore labor / and go in badde pasture
And some be again / still lean and poor is seen
Though it fatly fare / within a medowe grene
Though thou Codrus / still argue till to morrow
I lycke no dysshes / which sauced is with sorrow
Better one small dysshe / with joy and heart lyking
Than diverse denties with murmr and grutching
And men unlearned / can never be content
When scolers common / and clerks be present
As soon as clerks / begin to talk and chat
Some other gloumes / and has envy thereat
It is a tourment a clerk to sytte at board
Of his lernyng / not for to talk one word
Better were to be with clerks with a crust
Than at such tables / to fare at will and lust
Let me have the board of old Pytagoras
Which of temperaunce a very father was
Of philosophers the moderate richesse
In youth or age / I loved never excess
Some bost and promise / and put men in confort
Of large gifts / most men be of this sort
With mouth and promise for to be lyberall
When need requires / than give they naught at all
All only in the is fired all my trust
If thou fail promise / than roll I in the dust
My hope is faded / than shall my song be dom
Like a nightyngale at the solsticium
If thou fail promise my confort clean is lost
Than may I hang my pype upon the post
Shytte thy shop wyndowes for lack of marcha^dice
Or else for because / that easy is the price

Codrus. Mynalcas / if thou the court of Rome have seen
With forked cappes / or else if thou have been
Or noble prelates by richesse exellent
Thou well parceyuest / they be magnifycent
With them be clerks / and plesaunt orators
And many poets promoted to honors
There is abundaunce of all that men desire
There men have honor / before they it require
In such fair feldes / without labor or pain
Both wealth and richesse / you may lightly obtain

Mynalcas. Thou art abused and thynkest wrong doutlesse
To think that I am desirous of richesse
To feed on raw flesh / it is a wolves gyse
Wherefore he weneth all beestes do like wise
Because the blind man / halteth and is lame
In mind he thinks / that all men do the same
So for that thy self / desyrest good in store
All men thou iugest / infected with like sore
Codrus / I coueyt not to have abundaunce
Small thing me pleases I ask but suffisaunce
Grant me a lyueng suffycient and small
And void of troubles / I ask no more at all
But with that little / I hold me self content
If sauce of sorrow my mind not tourment
Of the court of Rome / for sothe I have herd tell
With forked cappes / it folly is to mell
Mycene and Morton / be deed and gone certain
They nor their like shall never return again
O Codrus Codrus / Augustus and Edward
Be gone for ever / our fortune is more hard
The scarlet robes / in song has small delight
What should I traueyle / in Rome is no profit
It gives mockes and skornes many fold
Still cratchyng coin / and gapyng after gold
Fraunde and disceyt / does all the world fill
And money reigns / and does althyng at will
And for that people / would more entende to gyle
Virtue and truth / be driven into exyle
We are commanded to trust for time to come
Till care and sorrow / has wasted our wisdom
Hope of reward / has poets them to feed
Now in the world / fair words be their mede.

Codrus. Than write of batayls / or acts of men bold
Or mighty princes / they may the well uphold
These worthy rulers of fame and name royal
Of very reason ought to be lyberall
Some shall thou find bitwene this place and Kent
Which for thy labor / shall the ^yghtwell content.

Mynalcas. ye / some shall I find: which be so prodigal
That in vain things spend / and clean wastes all
But how should that man / my poverty sustain
Which naught reserueth his honor to me^tayne.
For ancient blood / nor ancient honor
In these our days / be naught without treasour
The coin auaunceth / need does the name deiect
And where is treasour / old honor has effect
But such as be rich and in promocion
Shall have my writing but in derisyon
For in this season great men of exellence
Has to poemys no greatter reverence
Than to a brothell or else a brothelshous
Mad ignorance is so contagyous.

Codrus. It is not semyng / a poet thus to jest
In wrathful speech / nor words dishonest.

Mynalcas. It is no iestyng be thou never so wroth
In open langage to say nothing but truth
If parauenture / thou would have truth kept still
Provoke thou not me / to anger at thy will
When wrath is moved / than rayson has no might
The tongue forgets discrecyon and right

Codrus. To move thy minds / I truly were full loathe
To give good counsel is far from being wroth.

Mynalcas. As touching counsel my mind is plentiful
But need and troubles / make all my reason dull
If I had counsel and gold in like plente
I tell the Codrus / I had no need of the
How should a poet / poor / bare / and indygent
Indyte the acts / of princes exellent
While scant is worth / a knyfe his pype to mende
To round the holles / to cleanse or pyke the end
Behold my whittell / almost has lost the blade
So long time past / is sith the same was made
The hafte is bruised / the blade not worth a straw
Rusty and tothed / not much unlike a saw
But touching this hurt / it is but light and small
But care and trouble / is grievous pain withal
Good counsel helps / making the wits stable
Ill counsel makes / the minds varyable
And breketh the brain / deminysshing the strength
And all the reason / confounds at the length
Great men are shamed / to give thing poor or small
And great they deny / thus give they naught at all
Beside this Codrus / princes and men royal
In our enditynges / has pleasure faint and small
So much power have they / with men of might
As simple douues / when eglys take their flight
Or as great wyndes / cares for leaves dry
They live in pleasure / and welthe continually
In lust their lyking is / and in idleness
Few have their minds / from all vicyousnesse
Pleasure is thing / whereto they must entende
That they most cheriss he / they would have men co^cende
If poets should / their manners magnify
They were supporters of blame and lechery
Than should their writing / be nothing commendable
Containing iestes / and deeds detestable
Of stynking Uenus / or love inordynate
Of rybaude words / which fall not for a state
Of right oppressed / and beestly glotony
Of vice auaunced / of slouthe and injury
And other deeds / in fame and worthy blame
Which were over long / here to recount or name
These to commend / Codrus do not agree
To any poet / which loves chastyte.

Codrus. What / yes Mynalcas / some have been strong and bold
Which have in battle / done acts manyfolde
With mighty courage / having them in fight
And boldly byding / for to maynteyne the right
To the could I now / rehearse welnere ascore
Of lust nor richesse / setting no force ne store
Despisyng soft gold / sweet fare / and beds soft
Which in cold harnes / lie on the ground full often
Closed in iron / which when their wounds blede
Want breed and drink / them to restore and feed
While some has pleasure / in soft gold orient
With cold hard iron / their mind is well content
Such were the sons / of noble lord Hawarde
Whose famous acts / may shame a faint cowarde
What could they more / but their sweet lives spend
Their princes quarrel / and right for to defend
Alas that battle / should be of that rigor
When fame and honor / ryseth and is in flower
With sudden furour / than all to quence again
But boldest hertes / be nerest death certain.

Mynalcas. For certain Codrus / I can not that deny
But some in battle / behave them manfully
Such as in battle / do acts marcyall
Laud worthy poets / and style heroycall
The plesaunt muses / which sounds grauyte
Had help and favor / while these were in degree
But sithe strong knights / have left their exercise
And manly virtue / corrupted is with vice
The famous poets / which ornatly endyte
Have found no matter / whereof to sing or write
The wit thus dies / of poets ancient
So does their writing / and deties eloquent
For lack of custom / thought / care / and penury
These be confounders / of plesaunt poesy
But if some prince / some king / or conqueror
Has won in arms / or battle great honor
Full little they force / for to delate their fame
That other realms / may laud or praise their name
Of time for to come / they force nothing at all
By fame and honor / to live as immortal
It them suffyseth / they count enough truly
That their own realms / their names magnify
And that for their life / they may have laud and fame
After their death / than seek they for no name
And some be untaught and learned no seyence
Or else they disdain / hye style of eloquence
Than stands the poet / and his poem arere
When princes disdain for to read or here
Or else some other / is drowned all in gold
By couetyse kept / in cures many fold
By flagrant ardour / inflamed in such cas
As in time past the old king Mydas was
Than of poemes / full small pleasure has he
Couetyse and clergy / full leudly does agree
Beside this Codrus / with princes commonly
Be untaught courters / fulfilled with envy
Juglers and pykers / bourders / and flatrers
Baudes and ianglers / and cursed auoutrers
And mo such other / of lyueng vicyous
To whom is virtue / aduers and odyous
These do good poets / forth of all courts chase
By thousand manners / of thretnyng and manace
Sometime by frauds / sometime by ill report
And them assysteh / all other of their sort
Like as when curres / light on a caryon
Or stinkyng rauyns / fed with corrupcion
These two all other / away does beat and chase
Because they alone / would occupy the place
For unto curres / is caryon most mete
And also rauyns / think stynkyng things sweet
Another thing yet / is greatly more dampnable
Of rascolde poets / yet is a shameful rabble
Which void of wisdom / presumes to endyte
Though they have scantly / the connyng of a snyte
And to what vices / that princes most intend
Those dare these foles / solemnyse and commend
Than is he decked / as poet laureate
When stinkyng Thays / made him her graduate
When muses rested / she did her season note
And she with Bacchis / her camous did promote
Such rascolde drames / promoted by Thays
Bacchis Lycoris / or yet by Testilys
Or by such other / new forged muses nine
Think in their minds / for to have wit divine
They laud their verses / they bost / they vaunt and get
Though all their connyng / be scantly worth a pet
If they have smelled / the arts trinycall
They count them poets / hye and heroycall
Such is their folly / so folisshely they dote
Thinkyng that none / can their plain error note
yet be they folysshe / avoid of honest
Nothing seasoned / with spice of grauyte
Avoid of pleasure / avoid of eloquence
With many words / and frutelesse of sentence
Unapt to learn / disdayning to be tought
Their private pleasur / in snare so have the^ caught
And worst yet of all / they count them exellent
Though they be frutelesse / rasshe and improuident
To such ambages / who does their mind enclyne
They count all other / as private of doctrine
And that the fautes / which be in them alone
Also be common / in other men echone
Thus bide good poets / oftyme rebuke and blame
Because of other / which have dispysed name
And thus for the badde / the good be clean abject
Their art and poem / counted of none effect
Who wants reason / good to discryue from ill
Does worthy writers / enterprete at his will
So both the lauds / of good and not laudable
For lack of knowledge / become vituperable.

Codrus. In faith Mynalcas / I well allow thy wit
yet would I gladly / here now some merry fytte
Of maid Maryon / or else of Roby Hode
Or bentleys Ale which chaseth well the blood
Of Pert of Norwyche / or sauce of Wylberton
Or buckysshe ioly / well stuffed as a ton
Talk of the botell / let go the book for now
Combrous is co^nyng / I make to god auowe
Speak of some mat / which may refreshe my brain
Trust me Mynalcas / I shall reward thy pain
Else talk of stoutney / where is more brain than wit
Place most abused / that we have spoke of yet.

Mynalcas. Of all these things / langage to multiply
Except I lied / should be but villainy
It is not semyng / a poet one to blame
All if his honor / have won dyffamed name
And though such beestes / pursue me with envy
Malgre for malice / that payment I defy
My master techeth / so does reason and skyll
That man should restore / and render good for ill

Codrus. Than talk of somewhat / lo it is long to night
yet has the son / more than one hour of light

Mynalcas. if I naught common / soundyng to grauyte
I fear to obtain / but small reward of the
But if I common of vice or wantonness
Than of our lord / shall my reward be less
Wherefore my balade / shall have conclusyon
Of fruitful clauses / of noble Solomon.

Codrus. Sing on Mynalcas / he may do little thing
Which to a balade / disdayneth the heryng
But if thy dytie / accord not to my mind
Than my reward / and promise is behind
By man's manners / it lightly does appear
What men desires / that love they for to here

Mynalcas. Though in thy promise / I find no certente
yet of my connyng / shalt thou have part of me
I call no muses / to give to me doctrine
But aid and confort / of strength and might divine
To clear my reason / with wisdom and prudence
To sing one balade / extract of sapyence.

AS meadows painted / with flowers redolent
The sight reioyseth / of such as the^ behold
So man endewed / with virtue exellent
Fragrantly shyneth / with beams many fold
Virtue with wisdom / excedeth store of gold
If richesse habounde / set not on them thy trust
When strength is sturdy / than man is perte and bold
But wit and wisdom soon leyeth him in the dust.
Than man is beestly / which seweth carnal lust
Spend not on women / thy richesse or substance
For lack of vsyng / as steel or iron rust
So rusteth reason / by wylfull ignorance
In fraudefull beauty / set thou but small pleasaunce
A plesaunt apple / is often corrupt within
Ground the in youth / on goodly governance
It is good token / when man does well begin.
Joye not in malice / that is a mortal sin
Man is parceyued / by langage and doctrine
Better is to lose / than wrongfully to win
He loves wisdom / which loves disciplyne
Rass he enterprises / often brings to ruin
A man may contend / god gives victory
Set never thy mind / on thing which is not thine
Trust not in honor all welthe is transitory.
Combyne thou thy tongue / with reason and memory
Speak not to hasty / without aduysement
So live in this life / that thou may trust on glory
Which is not caduke / but lastyng parmanent
There is no secret / with people vyuolent
By beestly surfeit / the life is breuyate
Though some have pleasure / in sumptuous garment
yet goodly manners / him makes more ornate.
Codrus. Ho there Myaclas / of this have we enough
What should a plouman / go farther tha^ his plough
What should a shepherde / in wisdom wade so far
Talk of his tankarde / or of his box of tar
Tell somewhat else / wherein is more conforte
So shall the season / and time seem light and short

Mynalcas. For thou of Hawarde / now lately did recyte
I have a dytie / which Cornir did endyte
His death complaining / but it is lamentable
To here a captain / so good and honorable
So soon withdrawn by dethes cruelte
Before his virtue / was at most high degree
If death for reason / had showed him favor
To all his nacyon / he should have been honor
Alas / bold hertes / be nerest death in war
When out of danger / cowardes stand a far.

Codrus. All if that ditye / be nener so lamentable
Refrain my tears / I shall as I am able
Begin Mynalcas / tell of the bold Hawarde
If fortune favor / hope after some reward.

Mynalcas. I pray the Codrus / my whey is weke and thyn
Len me thy botell / to drink or I begin.

Codrus. If ought be tasted / the remnaunt shall pall
I may not before the / now for to spend out all
We sytte in shadow / the son is not fervent
Call for it after / than I shall be content.

Mynalcas. Still thou desyrest / the pleasure of my art
But of thy botell / naught will thou yet depart
Though you be negarde / and naught wylt give of thine
yet this one time / thou shall have part of mine
Now harken Codrus / I tell mine elegy
But small is the pleasure / of doleful armony.

The discrypcion of the tower of Virtue and Honor / in to which the noble
Hawarde contended to enter / by worthy acts of chiualry.


Mynalcas speaks. High on a mountain / of highness marvelous
With pe^dant clyffes / of stones hard as flent
Is made a castle / or toure most curyous
Dredefull unto sight / but inward exellent
Such as would enter / find paynes-tourment
So hard is the way / unto the same mountain
Straight / hye / and thorny / tournyng and dyfferent
That many labor / for to ascend in vain.
Who does persevere / and to this toure attain
Shall have great pleasure / to se the bylding old
Joined and graued / surmountyng man's brain
And all the walls within of fynest gold
With old hystories / and pyctures manyfolde
Glystring as bright / as Phoebus orient
With marbyll pyllers / the bylding to uphold
About the turrettes / of shape most exellent.
This toure is gotten / by labor dilygent
In it remains / such as have won honor
By holy lyueng / by strength or tournament
And most by wisdom / attain unto this tour
Brefely all people / of godly behauour
By rightwyse battle / justice and equity
Or that in mercy / have had a chief pleasure
In it have rowmes / each after his degree
This goodly castle / thus shinyng in beauty
Is named castle / of virtue and honor
In it eight Henry / is in his mageste
Most hye enhaunsed / as ought a conqueror
In it remains the worthy governor
A stock and fountain / of noble progeny
Most noble Hawarde / the duke and protector
Named of Northfolke / the flower of chiualry.
Here is the Talbot / manfull and hardy
With other princes / and men of dignyte
Which to win honor does all their might apply
Supportyng justice / concord / and equity
The manly Corson / within this toure I se
These have we seen / echone in his estate
With many other / of hye and mean degree
For mercy all acts / with crowns laureate.
Of this strong castle / is porter at the gate
Strong sturdy labor / much like a champyon
But goodly virtue / a lady most ornate
Within governs / with great prouisyon
But of this castle / in the most highest trone
Is honor shinyng / in rowme imperyall
Which unrewarded / of them leueth not one
That come by labor / and virtue princypall.
Ferefull is labor / without favor at all
Dredefull of vysage / a monster vntretable
Like Cerberus lyeng / at gates infernal
To some men his look / is half intolerable
His shulders large / for burden strong and able
His body bristled / his neck mighty and styffe
By stourdy senewes / his joints strong and stable
Like marbyll stones / his hands be as styffe.
Here must man vanquysshe / the dragon of Cadmus
Again the Chymer / here stoutly must he ^ight
Here must he vanquysshe / the ferefull Pegasus
For the golden flese / here must he show his might
If labor gainsay / he can nothing be right
This monster labor / often changes his figure
Sometime an ore / abore / or lion wight
Plainly he seems / thus chaungyng his nature.
Like as Protheus / often changed his stature
Mutable of figure / oftymes in one hour
When Aristeus / in bonds had hymsure
To diverse fygures like wise changes labor
Under his brows he dredefully do the lour
With glystring eyes / and side dependant berde
For thurst and hunger / always his chere is sour
His horned forheed / does make faint hertes ferde.
Always he drinks / and yet always is dry
The sweat distyllyng / worth drops habu^dant
His breast and forheed / does humor multiply
By swetyng shoures / yet is this pain pleasant
Of day and of night / his restyng time is scant
No day ouerpasseth / erempt of busyncsse
His sight enfourmeth / the rude and ignorant
Who dare parseuer / he gives them richesse.
None he auaunceth / but after steadfastness
Of little burden / his belly is and small
His mighty thyes / his vigor does express
His shankes sturdy / and large fete withal
By wrath he rages / and still does chyde and brall
Such as would enter / repellyng with his cry
As well estates / as homely men rural
At the first enter / he thretneth yrefully.
I trow old fathers / whom men now magnify
Called this monster / Mynerua stout and sour
For strength and senewes / of man most comenly
Are tame and febled / by cures and labor
Like as becomes / a knight to fortify
His princes quarrel / with right and equite
So did this Hawarde / with courage valtantly
Tylldethe abated / his bold audacyte.
O happy Sampson / more fortunate than he
Only in strength / but not in hye courage
O cruel fortune / why durst thy cruelte
This flour of knighthode / to slay in lusty age
Thou have debated / the flour of his lynage
If thou had mercy / be wayle his death thou might
For cruel loins / and mo beestes savage
Long time not cessed / sore to be wayle this knight
O death thou have done / against both law and right
To spare a cowarde / without danger or wound
And thus soon to quench / of chiualry the light
O death enuyous / most enmy to our ground
What most aueyleth / thou sonest do confound
Why did not virtue / assyst her champyon
Thou might have aided / for sothly thou was bound
For during his life / he loved the alone.
O god almighty / in thy eternal trone
To whom all virtue / is dear and acceptable
If reason suffered / to the our cry and moan
This deed might impute / and fortune lamentable
Thou might have left us / this knight most honorable
Our welthe and honor / to have kept in degree
Alas why has death / so false and disceyuable
Mankind to tourment / this will and lyberte.
It quenches virtue / sparyng iniquite
The best it stryketh / of badde having disdain
No help nor confort / has our aduersyte
Death daily strikes / though we daily compain
To treat a tyranne / it is but thing in vain
Meekness provoke / his wrath and tyranny
So at our prayer / death has the more disdain
We do by meekness / his furour multiply.
If some fell tyranne / replete with villainy
Should thus have endyng / the deed were commendable
But a stout captain / disposed to mercy
So soon thus faded / the case lamentable
Was he not humble / ioconde and companable
No man dispysing / and first in all labor
Rightwyse with mercy / debollaire and tretable
Mate and companyon / with every soudyour.
Uyce he subdued / by goodly behauour
Like as a ryder / does a wild stead subdue
His body subget / his soul was governor
From vice withdrawn / to goodness and virtue
When pride rebelled / meekness did eschew
Fre mind and alms / subdued auaryce
Always he noted / this saying just and true
That noble minds / dispyseth couetyse.
His death declares / that slouthe he did espyse
By hardy courage / as first in ieopardy
Al way he used / some noble exercise
Such as belongs / to noble chiualry
In him was there found / no sparcle of envy
Always he lauded / and praised worthynesse
Such as were doughty / rewardyng largely
Wrath save in season / he wisely could repress.
Of wine or Bacchus / despised he excess
For minds kyndled to acts mercyall
Sekyng for honor / and name of doughtynesse
Despyseth surfeit / and lyueng beestyall
In him no power / had lust veneryall
For busy labor / and plesaunt abstynence
All corporal lust / soon causes for to fall
No lust subdueth / where reigns dilygence
He was a pyller / of sober contynence
His only treasure / and iowell was good name
But O cursed death / thy wrathful vyolnece
By stroke vnwarned / half blinded of his fame
Who may I accuse? who may I put in blame?
God for death / or fortune / or impotent nature
God does his pleasure / and death will have the same
Nature was mighty / long able to endure.
In fortune the faut is / hold now am I sure
I would if I durst / his tyranny accuse
O cursed fortune / if thou be creature
Who gave the power / thus people to abuse
Thy mutable might / me causes often to muse
When man is plunged / in dolor and distress
Thy face thou chaungest / which did erst refuse
By sudden chances / him liftyng to richesse.
And such as long time / have lived in nobles
Anon thou plungest / in pain and pouerte
Welthe / honor / strength / right / justice / and goodness
Misery / dolor / low room / and iniquyte
These thou rewardest / like as it pleases the
To man's merit / without respect at all
One this day being / in great authorite
Again to morrow / thou causest for to fall.
When man is worthy / a room imperyall
On him thou gloumest / with froward cou^tena^ce
Weyke is thy promise / reuoluyng as a ball
Thou have no favor / to godly governance
No man by merit / thou use to auance
O blinded fortune / oftyme unfortunate
When man the trusts / than falls some myschance
Unwarely chaungyng / his fortune and estate.
Tell me frail fortune / why did thou breuyate
The lyueng season / of such a captain
That when his acts ought to be laureate
Thy favor turned / him suffering to be slain
I blame the fortune / and the excuse again
For though thy favor / to him was rigorous
Such is thy custom / for to be uncertain
And namely when man / is hye and glorious.
But most worthy duke / hye and vyctorious
Respyre to conforte / se the vncertaynte
Of other princes / whose fortune prosperous
Of time has ended / in hard aduersyte
Read of Pompeius / whose pereles dignyte
Again great Caesar / did welthe of Rome defend
Whom after fortune / brought in captiuyte
That he in Egypt / was heeded at the end.
In likewise Caesar / which did with him co^tende
When all the world / to him was subyngate
From his hye honor / did suddenly discende
Murdered in Rome / by chance unfortunate
Cato an Seneke / with Tully Rewreate
These and mo like / for all their sapyence
Has proved fortune / sore blynding their estate
By wrongful sclaunders / and deedly violence.
To poor and rich / it has no difference
Old Polycraces / supposyng peril past
With death dishonest / ended his exellence
Great Alexander by fortune / was down cast
One draught of poison him filled at the last
Whom all the world / erst could not sacyate
What is all honor / and power but a blast?
When fortune thretneth / the life to breuyate
Behold on Pyrrus / the king unfortunate
With a small stone / deed prostrate on the ground
Se Ualeryan brought down from his estate
From his empire / in Percy thrall and bound
Of old Priamus / it is in writing found
How he by* Pyrrus / was in his paleis slain
Paris and Hector / received mortal wound
To trust in fortune / it is a thing in vain.
The mighty Cyrus / a king of realms twain
Was slain and his host / of Thomyrus the queen
Thus is no matter / of fortune to complain
All that new falls / of old time has been seen
This shall be / this is / and this has ever been
That bold hertes / be nerest ieopardy
To dye in battle / is honor as men wene
To such as have joy / in hauntyng chiualry.
Such famous endyng / the name does magnify
Note worthy duke / no cause is to complain
His life not ended / foul nor dishonestly
In bed nor tavern / his lusts to meyntayne
But like as besemed / a noble captain
In sturdy harness / he dyed for the right
From dethes danger / no man may fly certain
But such death is metest / unto a noble knight.
But death it to call / me think it is unright
Sith his worthy name / shall last parpetuall
To all his nation / example and clear light
But to his progeny / most specially of all
His soul is in pleasure / of glory eternal
So duke most doughty / joy may that noble tree
Whose branches honor / shall never fade ne fall
While be is in earth / or fysshes in the sea.
Lo Codrus / I here have told the by and by
Of shepherde Cornir / the woeful elegy
Wherein he mourned / the grievous pain and hard
And last departing / of noble lord Hawarde
