EPIGRAMS and sentences spiritual in verse, of GREGORI NAZANZEN, an ancient
and famous Bishop in the Greek church: Englished by Tho. Drant.

Imprinted at London in fletestreate, near unto S. Dunstones church by Thomas
Marshe. 1568.

To the right honorable, the right reverent father in God Edmonde Bishop of
London, his very good Lord and Master, Tho. Drant wishes grace and peace
with long and joyful life, in the everliving God through Christ our Savior.
PErusing (right honorable) some of the German writers, and delighting in
their pretty and witty verses, which to the texts and common places of holy
scriptures they fitly have applied: I found no sayings in them of a more
quick and godly sense, then those which they bring out of Gregory
Nazanzen, a Doctor of the Greek church very well learned, and very eloquent.
Basil the great has called him the Uessell of election, the profounde
fountain, the mouth of Christ. Baptist Mantuan thus writes in his
commendation.

Nunc Maximus ille Gregorius, cui dat diuina scientia tantum
Nomen, adest, hodie sacros habiturus honores
Praesule patre satus (nam tunc id iura sinebant)
Pastorale pedum gessit post funera patris
By Zantina tulit faustos in menia gressus.
Fama viri traxit varijs ex gentibus agmen
Discipulorum ingens, illic Academica fecit
Gymnasia, and veteres illuc traduxit Athenas
Nam quot erant toto orb viri, qui scire profundos
Scripturarum aditus vellent, and mistica sensa,
Et Cabilistarum latebras, ea littora adibant,
Hieronymum fama est illuc veuisse trilinguem
Et legis didicisse sub hoc arcana magistro.
Amongst the rest his works those sentences, and Epigrams which are called
spiritual, are so in deed as they are called. They move the spirit, in mouinge
delight it, and that with an excellent and choice kind of delectation. Being
thus brought into a book, the book is small: and, a pearl is small likewise,
but if it were much bigger or better, it would make me the gladder. That these
few sayings of Gregory Nazanzen should be to your L. addressed (as the
doings of a learned father to a learned father) that is of congruitie: that
from me to your L. that is of my duty. Neither do I recke, or reckon how
great it is, but how great, and good I would have it to be. Neither is it as a
thing in it self able to show my good will: be it therefore as an argument
that if I had better wherewith, I would have been right willing to have showed
it. This humbly craving I cease to trouble you. The.x. of April.

Your Lordships to be commanded Tho. Drant.

De Gregorio ad Lectores.
GRegorius sanctus pulchri preceptor honesti
Haec cecinit Graia carmina sancta lyra,
Gregorius recte, non ille Gregarius, ergo
Hunc sum summi sic coluere sophi.
Graecia magna suu^ magnu^ nunc versat alumnu^,
Si populo pietas, religioque siet,
Orator, Doctor, Vates, facundior alter
Haud fuit, haud nu^c est, credo nec esse potest.
Vix vidit quidq praeclarius auricomus sol,
Ingenio plenus, plenus and ille deo.
Credit Gregorium (Lectores) versibus istis
Paucis, and paruis plurima magna loqui.
Spectetis numeros, numeris vel numen in ipsis,
Omne tulit punctum, iudiciumque bonum.
Ad Gregorium
Dulces docta modos loqui
Dum Christum celebrat Calliope tua:
Dum tristis querulo temporis, and loci
Defles carmine crimina:
Praestans dum quatitur Chelis:
Dum certas fidibus non triuialibus:
Dum fundis numeros nobilis (O) bonos:
Vincis maxim Gregori.
Primae vos superas viros,
Et Maya genitus, Linus, and Orpheus,
Alcaei taceat barbiton optimum:
Vincis barbiton Alcaei.
Dum pascis domini gregem,
(Est (...) tua sic cignia (...))
Dulcis, dulcior es mellibus Atticis:
Claris clarior omnibus.
Agros flumine dum rigas:
Dum cogis pecudes montibus Israel:
Et dum manna fluit faucibus inclytis:
Fauces mella stipant tuum.
Viuis maxim Gregori,
Laetis, atque bonis aedite saeculis.
Acris, melli fluus, doctiloquus, pius,
Vincis maxim Gregori.
W. C. Doctor, to the translation.
SOme venture far with little skill
On matters great of weight,
Whose stuff is good, but working ill,
They reach above their height.
Some goodly gifts on matters gross
Bestow with busy pain:
Whose metal base the workmen staynes,
Lost is their labor vain.
Sometime fine workmen of the best
Do work in metal puer,
They frame a work of great renown
Which ever shall enduer.
Such is this book: her golden gift
Does work in finest gold,
A worthy work, and workman fine
Here both in one behold.
Two kinds of life, Active, and Contemplative.
Which life of twain does better seame to thee,
That which is bent to outward exercise:
Or that which still contemplative would be?
The one love mo, the other the more wise.
Both this, and that are pleasant like and fit,
But what is fit for the, best like thou it.
Try thy self, before thou intermedle with holy matters.
A ghostly question one of me did ask,
Have thou examined well thy self (quod I)
Else do thou but attempt a sinful task,
I am clean purified (quod he) pardy.
For who is he that has not lost his wit,
New oil to vessels old that will commit?
Trust not lightly nor cavil much.
All manner words, or promis do not trust,
Against each speech, in no wise may thou mell,
But as through time, and place thou rightly must,
Obey thou God, whom thou can not excel.
With mouth all men most egrely do strive:
With manners never one that is alive.
A shame for a teacher to be reprouable.
Or never teach thou any any word at all,
Or else with manners do the same express:
Least one hand build, the other make to fall.
The better life, of words it neades the less:
We judge a Painter so to be of skyll,
Even as his workmanship is good, or ill.
Let Bishops, and Prelates give light.
O you that Lordlike rule so stern, and stout,
Whose wealth, and worship stretches far, and wide:
Take heed your lyncks, and lanterns go not out,
Least wicked Prelates you at last be tryde,
If light be dark, that was so bright, and trim,
What wylbe darkness of it self so dim?
Well doing is better then well saying.
A speacheles deed does pass a deedeles word.
Without good deeds few have been caught up hie,
But those which finest phrase could not aforde,
Do naithelesse alday skale up to the sky,
Not of the babbling speaker god has neade,
But of the soul, that works his will in dead.
An acceptable offering unto God.
Most welcome gift to God is manners pure,
Though thou to him could all the world present,
The gift is not so good, thy self assure,
Before all gifts good life does him content.
Give him thy heart, as do the meake, that quake,
Thy coin (an horishe bribe) God will not take.
Make no vow to God.
Make thou no vow not in the smalest thing,
Thou guyles thy self to crake that that is thine
Which was gods own, before thou diddes it bring.
That from indebted us we should decline,
May warn us well in this our mortal life,
The death of Ananias and his wife.
Man's life a market.
Believe this life to be a very mart,
Great gain there is if thou will plie a while,
Eternal things for vain thou may by art
Exchange: and dearest ware for chaffer vile:
But if thou slougge, and loiter living here,
No other time, hereafter will appear.
The race of Christian life.
Far must we run in this our drery race,
But more shall be our guardon great in time,
Take heed thou have not so the whole timbrace
That of the whole thou mis with note of crime.
The devil that would us all from joy exempt*
On both hands thus does use the good to tempte.
Nor presume, nor despair.
Trust not to much, ne yet to much despair,
The one does make us dissolutely to bold,
That other leads to everlasting care,
Correct the last, and firm the former hold,
Arighte: and freely fare upon thy way
Not envy pale, not malice neade thee stay.
Keep on thy course in virtue.
Proceade in things with good advise begone,
To move at first makes not a good man's state,
But still to move until the thing be done,
For we do count him curste, and worthy hate,
Not who a litil downwarde slippes awry,
But he that falls exalted once on hie.
All occasion of evil is to be shunned.
A pretty spark does raise a mighty flame,
A Uipers seade does pestilently kill,
Instructed well, and warned by this same,
Eschew the smalest blot of any ill:
For being soylde with blemishe very small,
It draws dangers manifold with all.
Know thy self. Good deeds better then gold.
Thine own affairs look rather thou apply
Then to thy neighbors busily attend:
Thy neighbor he may some thing get thereby,
The other would thine own estate amend.
Good deeds are better much then fee, or gold,
The one decay, the other stand, and hold.
Study godliness: Charm thy tongue.
To sacred read thy mind devout dispose,
And to the rules divine of blessed life,
Thy tatling tongue let it not glide, or gloss,
In bablarie, or blablarie too rife,
Which if at random thou permit to walk,
I warrant thee no wynner by thy talk.
Temptation by thy eyes.
Our sight would gladly carry us away.
But by resisting tho it is represt,
We are not booteys for sir Cupides pay,
No idol minds to him we have Idrest:
The bait was fair disguist, but we are gonne,
Of Satan's snares, this certainly was one*
Temptation by the ears.
Against wanton talk thine ears with wax do shitte,
And against all sonneites delicate, and soft,
But what so for an honest man is fit,
That thou respectiuly must very often
Both mark with diligent, and hedie care,
And in thy saws and deeds the same declare:
Temptation by the other senses.
To odours womannishe, and fragrant smell,
Thy self to tender touchinges do not yealde,
If these do master thee, what will thou well
Deserve with hand in battle champion field?
The man has his peculiar proper praise:
The woman hirs by other diffring ways.
Be not to liberal to thy belly.
Still give me, give me, crithe the gredy paunche,
And have thou shall, if well thou can it save,
But if in dunge it passes by the haunche
Eftsoon, what boots it thee so much to have?
If thou do keep it long to make it more:
Of dunge thou do but treasure greater store.
Laughter must be laughed at.
Uaine laughter would be laughed at again,
And wanton laughter wyttely controlde,
Immodest laughter often insueth pain,
To laughe whiles down thy chekes the tears at rolde,
And better is a sad, and pewly face,
Then that which smileth smugge with smirking grace.
Favor and deformity.
True beauty does adorn a godly mind,
And is to it a furniture, (no doubt)
No furniture which time can change from kind,
Nor such as craft of hand can brave set out,
The mind not practisde does deformed lie,
As spieth he which has an inward eye.
Contempt of vanities.
Pensiveness, pleasure, shame, and penury,
Riches, honor, authority of throne,
Fearcenesse, and fear, let them both flitte, and fly,
Without regard to where they would begone:
Such things so tickle, fickle, vile, and vain,
Do nothing move a suerly settled brain.
The highness and humbleness of good works.
Be hie, not in thine own conceit at all,
For that with sudden swaye will cast the down,
If else thou buylst to hie, look for a fall,
Be hie in upright life, that will thee crown:
The more that thou exalted art on hie,
The less stand thou on thy maioritie.
Against vain glory and dissimulation.
Nor thou each praise, nor too much praise pursue,
Its wurst to be accounted then to be,
Fly praise which sprynges by gaie fond facions new
(In case thou know not measure in degree)
An Ape is he not still a very Ape,
Though all men judge he has a Lions shape?
Take not pride in praise, Praise not rashly.
If others praising vardit make thee proud,
Thou shall be thought a prayser for to want,
And rynging out an others praises loud,
His manners having yet seruaid skant,
If his demenour be perceived ill:
Thy credit that will quyte destroy, and spyll.
Pleasure not in deriding an other.
Its better much to bear a scoff, or scorn:
Then thee thy self to skorne, and scoff,
If that vncyuilly thou byst not torn,
Thy vantage is with bourde to bear it of.
So shall this merry mockyng kind of glee,
Unto the mocker most unpleasant be.
Triumph over no man.
Eere that thou commes to port, boast not thy gayle,
For many men upon the very shore,
Have wrecke their ship, and sunk adown their sail:
And many midst thick wrestling waves Ibore
Have safe aryvde upon the sedicke coast,
To laughe at no man's chance is wisdom most.
Better clear conscience in adversity, then fear of judgment in wealth.
So that thou lyvst in righteous manner here,
Though vndersoote, and subject unto throws
Prostrat to God in prayre, and conscience clear,
If that thou byst, and him sincerely knows:
Its better then berest of grace to smart,
Though all the world were framed to thy heart.
Alms measure.
Whatsoever goods thou have the same disburse,
That thou the lord of life may thine possess,
That is not thine which now is in thy purse,
If that thou givst not all give little less,
If so to give do cast thee into care:
Be free of that which safely thou may spare.
Alms dealing.
From mouths, and malice to the neady poor,
If thou at any time doste ought withhould,
Christ is thy debtor it for to restore
Who does his heavenly kingdom (more then goulde)
Give for a curste of bread: and all thy who
Do cladde the poor, do cladde our savior (lo)
As we are affected to the poor, so is Christ to us.
A poor man came to me in miserable case,
And empty went away naught having got,
O Christ I wretched man deuoire of grace,
Do fear lest by the very self same lote
I part from thee, he that does small dispense,
Receives small again departed hence.
Godly poverty is to be relieved.
The substance small does make the heart full light,
The poor man sighs, and sories much his case,
But upon God he bendes his total sight,
This poor man thou dear in thine arms embrace:
The Egle in her neast (we read it often)
A little stranger bird will harbor soft.
Poverty better then ill gotten riches.
Its better still to live in hardest need
Then rich to wax by treachery, and guyle,
So sickness better is then health with speade
That dangerous coms, and flittes within a while.
With hunger no man suddenly does die::
Sin kylleth, and condemns by and by.
A servant is a felovve servant.
Master and man, why do we use to say?
One head, one law we have, and eke one judge,
Thy servant thou thy fellow servant aye
To call and count do then in no wise grudge:
So thou thy self a master frank, and free,
Of freedom thine shall worthy counted be.
No shame to be a servant.
Servants? why not? chiefly gods servants tho
Unto their masters let them truly mean.
A freman, or a servant, ye, or no
By that we know as he does him demean:
Our savior Christ that did infranch is all,
To humble service did him self inthrall.
True nobility.
A shame it is not to be base, but badde,
From those whose since long are lodged in claye
The glory of thy gentry thou have had.
To help thy stock not hurt it, is the way.
Its better thee to be a godly broad,
Then child to those which godly be, and good.
Christ thrists to be thristed after.
Thou only God, and godly things desire,
Who more will give, the more that thou will take,
Full of all gifts what so thou will require,
And thrists for to be thristed for thy sake,
In other things if happily thou do miss,
That do, and keep which just, and measure is.
Cast not always to overcome.
Not always look to overcome thy foe,
Nor there about do beat, and bruise thy brain,
He wynnes sometime that lettes the maistrie go,
And gettes at lenght more full, and noble gain.
The champion often is daunted dead from hie:
And he does line that lurking low does lie.
Some loss bringes vantage.
It vantage think to suffer any loss,
That tree will be more fruitful then before,
That has lost both his thicket bows, and moss:
To goods ill got who still does heap up more,
Let him add fire to timber tunder dry,
Or to his body add a malady.
Forget and forgive.
If unto God thou byst indebted naught,
Thy debtor then in no wise do thou spare.
But if thy debtes by hunderds be in brought,
First to forgive let be thy spedie care.
So God in such a charitable case
Will recompense thee plenty grace for grace.
In injuries call to mind Christ his passion.
If wrong receyvde do wrast thy mind to ire,
Then call to mind his wounds ibroched kene,
What wrong had he unjustly for his hire
That once our master must aloft be seen?
His bleding wounds, and moisture of the same
Will moist, and quench the fearcenesse of thy flame.
The chastning of thy body is a medicine for vice.
Wine, lust, envy, and Satan are all one,
Whom they possess, the same they do oppress*
Tears, hunger, prayers, are deemed fit alone*
And meadsons meet the same for to redress.
So I those griefs do use for to assuage,
So stay I them, and rule them in their rage.
Swear not.
Swear not, how then? how should I then persuade?
With words, and deades which testimony clear
Do bring unto the words which thou have said:
He God denies, which does him self forswear
What neadst thou God profane in mouth so rife?
Make us believe thee by thine upright life.
The sum of the law is charity, and Christ his passion.
What rule of love have we most short and true?
As thou wouldes wyshe thy neighbors be to thee
Such one thy self unto thy neighbors show,
And such a one look plainly that thou be.
Christ's passion wayed well do this conteyne
In full effect, compendious, and plain.
A dear friend is a dear treasure.
Think nothing dearer then a faithful friend,
Not such as thou have won to thee in wine.
But such as trothe in troubles long did lend,
The other will not seek for thee, but thine.
A bridge thine ire, and sone it over send.
Of friendly love seek not to make an end.
Counsailers are necessary.
The eye that all things spies, it self not spies,
If it be blind, then spies it not in deed
It self, nor ought, but blind, and bluntishe lies:
Of counsaylers we then do stand in neade,
For so the hand does (pardie) neade the hand,
And of the foot, the foot in need does stand.
Backbiting, shamefastness.
If thou the good, and godly do obey,
And listened have, and leande to their behest,
Let the ungodly say what they can say,
Blushe not to hear them boldly gibe, and ieste
If any filthy act thou haste in mind,
Think thousands stand before thee, and behind.
Good company.
Prefer the good before the wicked sort,
The godly eke before thee godless route,
Ill shall thou be to ill if thou resort.
A wicked man no good can bring about.
Such one as gettes his goods by wicked ways.
And by expending them does gape for praise.
Fruits of fooes.
Some profit I can take, yea by my foe,
By shunning him, and dreading him each where,
I bear my self more wary where I go.
A bitter medson much we ought to tear,
Yet of the sweat that makes the palate feign,
More cause we have ofttymes for to complain.
Patience breaks envy.
Honor the good, contempne the lawless lewd,
For that they be inormouse lyvde in crime,
Whom praise thou not whilst still they be so shrewde
But them convert in patience, and time,
This is the bounty most, the gift most frank,
That thou can give, and worthy most of thank.
The measure of bounty.
Be liberal to the vtmoste of thy power
In time, and place so far as store will strech,
Unto thy neighbor do thy kind devour
There of the reason is not far to fetch,
To strangers who will think that thou art kind,
When to thine own ungrateful they thee find?
Blame our selves, not the devil.
Why do we blame the Devil? why do we so?
Why do we morn, that he does make us sin?
Our lives at randone louse why let we go?
The fault or hoallie we, or chief are in.
In this our flesh the fire we bear about:
The feende does blow to make the flame flashe out.
Dreams vain.
Believe not dreams, let them not thee deceive,
Nor let each fearful fancy the agriese,
If that thou hap some vision glad to have,
Be thou not proud thereof in any wise,
Such folishe fraud, and fond delightful pelf
From Satan comes, even from his very self.
Hope the best.
To all thy deeds a prosperous end propounde,
For if that God to doings which be ill
No hinderer, but a suffrer often be found:
The act that's good (no doubt) he further will:
Though ill thee good do seame for to appall
Yet ill at length shall find, and feel the fall.
Learning and wisdom.
Wisdom is safer thing then prosperous luck,
Fortune does faune, and sclender stroke does yealde,
But wit, and wisdom give the stronger pluck,
And only they do rule in town and field.
Learning does pass the brightest gift of mind,
A surer treasure shall we never find.
Stoutness, and courage.
Be stout, and stern, but not in deades iniust,
If thou will be gods dearling dear, and child,
But when thy case is good, and needs thou must,
Let dastarde fear, and dreede be quite exilde,
Theirs many ils that's causers of decay,
The hemlocke, and the Scorpion poison pay.
An old man without vvitte, a young without courage.
A young man less of courage then an old,
An old man then a young man less of wit,
Unsitting and unseemly both we hold,
The age does make the virtue kyndly fit.
Let him be wise as soon as he is old,
And him before his age of courage bold.
Work and watch.
Each man in fear, must work his saving health,
So much the more the nearer death does stand,
Old age will eftsoon step on us by stealth,
The trumpet soundes our end to be at hand:
Be ready therefore all both more, and some,
Be ready (O) the dreadful judge does come.
Wisdom better then riches.
A drop of luck before a tun of skill
Give me (so said a bold curmogine chuffe)
Phy (quoth the learned man) thou pratest ill,
And hark how little I esteem thy stuff*
One drop of skyll my heart would better please,
Then of good luck an hundred hudgie seas.
We deny God two vvayes.
In word and deed, our God we deny,
(So shetteth up my little pamflet book)
The Devil does dangerous lurk unto thee nigh,
Not far from thee, but round about the look.
Thy soul to save in present long distress
Give ever thanks to God, and blithe him bless.
FINIS.
Against the Arians, Hipocrites, and disceuers.
O Preistes that unto God
Hold sacred signs in hands,
On whom commission great
And charge of people stands:
Betwixe whose only arms
Gods workmanshippe does swaye,
You which both God, and man
In one partakynge lay,
Ye groundselles of the world,
Of life yelept the light,
Ye workers of the word,
You blessed to all men's sight,
Christbearers that should be.
Now Lords you set aloaft,
With Pantackles, and moilles
Your fete are feanced soft,
To pageanes, and to plays,
Ye sawnter up, and down,
On Theaters ye shine,
The freshest in the town
Pretensed outward shape
Ye conterfeete, and steal
But in Religion true,
Pure inwardly to deal,
You are from that as far,
As miserable stocks,
As most infected sheep
Of all your scabye flocks.
Play on thou careless crew,
As found thou have begun,
With countenance grave pronounce.
Which lightly thou have dunne.
How so ever thou me calls,
A person lewd, and light,
And bids me get me far,
Exiled from thy sight,
And do with arrows thick
Of opprobrie me smite,
Wherein as well I see,
Thou highly do delighte,
Yeat what my mind me gives,
That bouldely will I say,
To the a folk unkind,
My heart I will outlaye*
Even as the water streams,
If stern the whether blow,
Compelled keep beneath,
And down there swellinge throw,
Then brymme again do rise
With murmr, and with heat,
And hie with spreadyng floode
Orwart the feildes do beat:
So I can not inhoulde
This dolor in my breast,
But out it forcing flies
Impacient of rest.
Give good leave for to speak,
Forgive what I auouche,
If I your galled* minds
With words do chance to touch
True pleadges of my teene
Are words, and of my care,
And though they bootlesse fly,
And bussinge beat the air,
Yet practyse proves it plain,
We tell it as we find,
Talk presently does ease,
The payned pensive mind:
Christ's body, and renown,
(His flock spread far abroad)
Was quiet, whilst it void
Of right Relligion boade,
Now gods possession due,
Addicted unto him,
It sperplith here and there,
As waves amydde the brymme.
Or as the Pynetre frame
With wanton Eastwinde strength:
From skies abatinge power
To his Christ came at lenght,
To humanekynde I knytte
He God, and man was hear,
And on his body bold
A dreadful death did bear,
For our outragiouse sins,
Forth lardge his blood did stream,
That with such pension proud,
Our sins he might redeem.
Then ready sheep to dye,
His ministers he sent,
Who through out many realms
His word vpbearinge went.
And sweet accounted death
That came from cruel hand,
For with gods honor high
It seamed well to stand,
That all his servants true
Attendant to his state,
On his word with their word,
On blood with blood should wait.
But who our body shakes?
Whence springs this mischeifes load?
How commes the moon so dark,
That once so brigome boade?
How could that brockishe Boar
Our Harvest so destroy?
Who ardent angrye seeks
Our kindred to annoye.
Since first he Adame wrought
From everlasting bliss,
A forcye ferce assault
To give he does not miss.
Yet totally our kind
(Nathlesse his wilye pate)
He compass not with craft,
Nor stirde them from their state.
The sperklynge word of God,
That candle blasyng bright
Through lands, and countries far
Upheaued by his light.
The eager martires hearts
Were boulned more to die,
The more that they the rage
Of Tirantes dire did spy.
Then Satan slye that spied.
Our souldyers victores still
Amongste their vnderguides
Dissentious seed did spill.
The cheiftane tayne away
The army can not bide,
The ship that fletyng gaie
Upon the surge does ride
(The Pylott if he mysse)
With wind his warped low,
Or wrekyng all her wares
Her self on rocks does throw.
So Cities, houses, flocks,
There absent guides do rewe:
The waganers not skilde
Their wagons overthrew:
Whoseuer hears among us
What myscheifes craule and crepe,
Will therefore blame, and banne
The shepard, not the sheep.
For manquellers were once
Appointed romes to lurcke,
And romes assigned wear
For Pagans Sabott work.
For service of the Iues
Erected was a place,
Which kings, and Rulers stout
Made even with ground in space.
How well I will not say:
Nor do I honor those
That in such wicked acts
Their likinges do repose.
The Lord him self I know
Their Temples does detest,
Those therefore laid it down:
So now the worst and best,
The gentill, and the Iue,
The Turk with us is pressed.
In one Chrucheyarde we lie,
Our Cophins cople near,
And in the Church of Christ
Our service now they hear.
This venerable seat,
This Temple for the wise,
Where in there whilome dwelt
Most perfitt pure precyse,
This pulpet wherein prechde
Right angels of the air,
This chauncel, and this church,
So durable, and fayer.
To where God, and good men
Were wonted to repayer,
This once was very so:
But now it is not rare.
To se how in they rushe.
The door stands open wide,
To intralles all they run,
Not one with out does bide.
I think some blast of trompe.
Has breathed up alowde, A blast of the world to disorder the Church.

And called in such likewise
The multitude to crowde.
Come hither less, and more
That ride on vices back,
Put spurs unto your horse
Beware you be not slack:
Ye filthe, ye bellyes big,
That lardge abroad do stroute,
Ye facelesse shameless beasts
In brows, and forehead stout,
Ye tiplinge vagaboundes,
Ye trouncers with your tongue,
Ye valyant beggars brag,
With wrangling that do wrong:
Ye concyences slye
Addressed to forswear,
Ye suytts of Sattens soft
So solemply that wear,
Ye that with greedy jaws
The people grate, and grind
Ye that do steal the shares
To other men assynde,
Ye iarrers in your house,
Ye breakers of your faith,
Ye wily slylye pates
That love to take no skath,
Ye that to noble men
Can ducke adowne so law,
And over look the poor
As you would eat them raw,
Ye tickle turnecottes, you,
That ligtly will be gonne,
And like the Lopster frame
Your hew to every stone,
Ye rouers in the fylde,
Ye romers in the town:
Ye women's men aright.
To squire them up and down.
Ye mynions fresh, and shene,
Of oders sweat that smell,
In whom all manner sin
Does principally dwell:
Come, come ye bouldly near,
Whatseeuer sort you be
All places in our church
For every man is free.
Take ease with head on hand
And stir not from your stall,
All things that hear we have,
Are common unto all.
Ye shall not neade to doubt
God straight will seende a shower,
And now for your sweet sakes,
He Manna down will power,
Each man may fill his lap
And bear at will away,
He more, he less, and if
You think it for your pay,
On Hoolydayes make bold
The sacred bread to take,
And let it rote at home
And light the matter make:
The air a common thing,
The earth a common thing,
The sky, and stars from hye
Their common light do bring.
The Sea a common thing,
Our seats are common all*
Among the Prophettes sage
There is a place for Saul.
Wherefore come plowghmen rude,
Come wrightes, and cobbers roughe,
Come neat makers, and ye
That strike on stithes toughe,
Let no man have a guide
Let none to pastors hark,
Who has on them in chardge
A sprituall care, and carke.
Its better for to teach
Then ever to be taught,
And he lives beast at ease
That suffrantie has wrought.
Let him cast down at once,
The plowgh all from his hands,
And let him cast away
His hatchett where he stands,
The skynner let him cast
A way his felles and skynnes
The Hunter let him cast
Away his huntyng gins
The blacksmith let him leave
His hammer, and his styth
And now no more thereon
Imploye his pains with pithe,
Come take you romes up all
About our holy table,
Let each man place him best,
As he by force is able,
Come thrust, and eke be thrust,
Maintain a myghtie thronge,
The stronger to the week,
The great to less do wrong,
Come to our preysthoode fast,
Forsake it not for heat,
Thrust whilles the stalles go down,
Thrust hardly whilst you sweat,
The best Preyst that is found,
The most deserving praise,"
The chief in all respects,"
Most holy in his ways,"
Afflicted is in flesh:"
Such one as loves the skies,"
Desyrs the world to come,"
This present does despise.
A servant true to Christ,
Who though he be in stead
Of living creature here,
Yet he in sin is dead.
This is the portrayt first,
This is the portrayt true,
And so in tables old
His lynyamentes they drue:
But he that looks on you,
Should think an other thing,
Thexample of your deades
An other thought would bring,
To paynt you in your kinds,
And fitlye in degree
Your sins, and vices rank
Right profitable be.
Thus did the Trumpett sound.
Example against rashness.
But Moses makes me carcke,
Who he alone did see,
Christ in a figure dark,
And badde all others else
Of great, and less account
So high not to presume,
But bide beneath the mount*
To wash their vestures pure,
And tremblyng tarry still,
To harken to Gods word,
And listen to his will.
Nor mell with flock, except
They would yeald up there bones,
To darts, to cragges, to rocks,
To dashe upon the stones.
So Arons childerns ends
For fear do make me quake,
Who incens for to burn
Did proudly undertake
At hoolye aulters pure:
They felt there dreadful bayne,
The sacred plott of bliss
Became their place of pain.
Though they were Arons sons,
And pleadges to him dear,
Yet destnyes sharp they found,
Presumynge foul so near:
So Helyes case his strange,
And heavy to behold,
For likwyse on his sons
Gods judgments just are rould.
Both for there saucye minds
And beastly longinge lust:
Whilst to the hoolye pottes
Their hands vnpure they thrust.
On Ely also self
Was wrought Gods wrekfull ire,
Of that unworthy seed
The worthy praised sire.
For belly of his sons
He had like bitter smart,
Though bitterly he warnd
Them oftens to convert.
If such offenses small
Have such a soory meede,
How ought outragouse crimes
To quake, and stand in dread
He also myser did
That would with hands profane
The falling Aicke of God
(Uncalde there to) sustain.
God would no ryott rude,
No dealyng so confuse,
And therefore temples cloase
For purpose he did choose,
O Christ, I weep, I morn
Flat prostrat on my face,
And almost is (me thinks)
Uncurable my case,
In that I did forsake
Still in my charge to toil,
Though greuouse were (God wot)
Mine agonye, and broyle:
I fought with rampinge wolfes,
I sought a drery time,
With eatars of their flocks,
With Pastors puffd with crime.
My mind does leave the corpse,
And hie it heuinge vauntes:
Dyseasd with open wrongs
And tossed with raylinge tauntes.
Christ ministers should be
Most simple, myld, and mecke,
But now with huffe and snuff
The prymate seats they seek
They brable, and they braule,
They take outtakynge pains,
They do, and suffer all
For griplenesse of gains.
As in a champion filled
They warrelyke marshe, and men
Right seruitors of Mars
In bickeringes brag, and fell,
Their glory is in bludde,
Their glosyng is of peace,
Would god that Getteys plagues
Upon their pates would cease,
Would God they guardon had.
A another sort disease,
With sects, and frantike scysmes
The east and weasterne seas,
God is not now their God,
But Paul, Apollo, Peter:
Or he is each man's God
To him that seems meter.
For men, and not for Christ
Good judged must we be,
So that our Christ in vain
Displayed was on tree,
And nailed was in vain,
Forth whose thrice blessed bludde,
Issued all our name,
And all our worship good.
Now Lust before our eyes
A clottered cloud has rould,
And in us Christian life
Has caught a crasie could,
Now avarice does raygne,
By stelth she clekes, and glenes,
Now pride does proule for praise
By lewd apparent means,
Now envy clappes her hands
An others hurt to spy:
Although thereby the worth
She win not of a fly.
To what so they do preach
They God protest before
Yet they apertly parts
Maintain, and factions sore:
They speak not as they think,
There saynges, and there mind
Or selde, or never in one.
Contunynge shall thou find.
The woulfe in shepishe tire
A simple soul does look,
They cover for the fyshe
A mortal hidden hoke,
Both those which have no guides,
And those which have such guides,
Without, or with such guids
All into mischeife slids.
Life holy, or profane,
Life dissolute, or strayte,
Gods word, and man's device
Are deemed by one rate.
One custom still we have,
And still is like to stand,
That he that is the worst
Best prosperse in the land.
The Lord confound that soul
That errors did invent,
That hateful head that first
Into the world them sent.
To them the world gives place,
To them gods self gives place,
The wills, and feese of men
They purchase thick in space,
Rewards are all their own.
Which shall be ours at length
Though now we toil in vain.
Ormatchde with steer, and strength.
Our Judges judge it so,
It rules what they say,
Dame justice from our coasts
An outlawe is away,
Alls one, Christ, man, the stars,
The sun, the dark, the light,
Proud Lusifer the black
And heavenly angels bright.
The Trayter Judas has
With Peter one reward,
Samaria is to
Jerusalem comparde.
Gould, silver, stone, and brass
An ownce, and dram are one.
A like the puddles vile
And fountains clear in stone.
All things are now alike,
All things are now confusde,
As matter with out form
Which first (they said) was used
In buildyng of the world.
The Amonittes of yore,
Nor Moabittes might tread
With in the Temple door:
Because they hurt Gods folk:
And they which with their mockes
Disquyeted Gods church
God signd for hewynge blocks.
And tancards for to bear:
Thus did the wicked speed
At Gods indifferent hands
They had no better meede.
But Leaves ofspringe aye
Prehemynence had great
With in the temple they
Were ministers in seat,
The service they sustaynde
The cuers on them did bide
All offices of chardge
Among them they did divide
Within and out the church:
Thus they did practice well
In holy deades devout
As then they did excel.
We, we, (O death) to sin
Do honor much present:
What planctiue Pooet can
These days enoughe lament.
A wake from vice (O world)
Time now for to repent
And God with hearty prayer
Is likly to relent.
You shall have happy health,
You shall have present aid,
If warned by my words
In time you will be staide.
But if my whightlie hears
And sawes you do dispies,
If younkers Rash and bold
Ye judge for to be wise,
If some with deathfull noise
And foolyshe perlouse dynne,
Do sott your sensles heart
And of me conquest win.
Our light I do protest
To darkness that does turn,
And Gods fire puysant hand
That shall make all to burn:
I will not take their part,
I dare not be their mate,
Nor of their read perverse
Once will I know the state.
We come not in one ship,
We sail not in one Bardge,
I will not walk their way
Nor sincke with them for chardge.
Let them post out the race
Which rashly they have run,
And speadely dispatche,
Which lightly they begone.
The helthfull arcke of Noys
I labor to assende,
To skape that is to come
Their doolefull dreadful end.
I will step from their pathe,
And void the shenfull shower,
That grysely hydeous plague
On Sodom that did power,
In this our yearthly corpse
That Sodom has a place,
The visage of the wise
With duste it does deface,
It rangeth up and down,
It does seduce the heart,
And is the motive cause
From path to make us starte.
I hope to take such head
To purge this Sodom out.
That safely I may smyle
At storms which lowdly route.
With fixed intentive mind,
And heaunly meaning will
Purposinge godly things,
Not common with the ill,
Unto the persons three
(One godheade) I will fare,
And to my savior Christ
Which sitts in judgment chare.
Wheare all things shall be open,
And evident in sight
In Gods eauen wayinge hand
The skole shall payse aright.
And vprightlie and just
Shall all be done in sight.
The oath of Nazensen being made Bishop.
BY Christ I swear above.
With God coeternall,
Begot before all worlds
And not begone at all:
His Fathers image true
Most like unto the same,
Which once for man's great love
From skies dissendyng came,
I swear, and swear again,
By Gods allmightful grace,
That I no errors false,
Nor fickle will embrace,
Nor that in other sense
The sentence of the lord,
I Will change, or with my words
Make worse his precious word.
If of the trynall power
The honor I divide,
Or if I freet in neade,
And from thy service slide,
If I for vpmost romes,
Do ever throng, or thrust,
Or if me captyue draw
With cord such longing lust,
If I on mortal man,
My confidence do lay,
And on so weke a help
My flotyue ship shall stay,
If that in waves of wealth,
My mind be pufte with pride,
Or if to soft delights
My wanton heart shall slide:
If I a judge assignde
Right judgment shall renye,
Or if the higher rome
Do make me look more hie,
If I tread not aright,
Or cease from doing well,
If I delight to se
The wicked bear the bell:
If malice freete my flesh,
If I do gibe, or skorne
At any man's myschaunce,
Or at my fooes forlorn,
If fancy make me mad,
If that my breast be blind,
If that my tongue does talk,
And tattle out of kind,
If rashlye I do hate,
Or seek revenge on fooe,
If empty from my house
I let a poor man gooe.
If I feed not those breasts
That thrist for Christ his word:
Then other men regard
And look on them (O Lord)
The labors old, and great
Which me have over loode
Comitt them to the wynds,
To carry them abroad,
This is my law of life,
The which if I embrace,
Nor thought, nor dead is mine,
(O Christ) it is they grace.
A spiritual dompe.
In heuie hard affairs,
The comfort of my grief,
My keeper trusty true,
The prope of my belief
Was aye the Godheade bright
Releude in these our coasts
Ariude at our rude cares,
Whose word amongst us hoasts.
This blessed godhead now
Each wicked wight does tear,
The lay man the fair,
The Churchman in the queere.
Now baudye babble raygnes,
The leachers none do slaye,
Scarce Phinees with his sword
(Alas) their meede could pay.
In name, and courage great.
Who shall Judea aid,
With Statut laws unjust
So reuouse over laid?
Will Moses cumme, and tell
Thegiptians laws are naught?
Amonst the people great
Shall great his praise be wrought?
Before king Pharao
A God shall he up stand
To taunt this godles age,
And Loosells of this land?
The godhead in his heart
Who rightly does conceive?
And does not from the hole
Some deal, or grace bereue?
Who does the furious words
Of enmyes so refell,
That in his heart, and mouth
Still love, and wit does dwell?
Who in this public breche,
For God this eger strife,
Does keep inbroken faith
Among children of this life?
Who does not like the waves
Of Euripus the fludde,
From this bancke unto that
From that to this reskudde.
O godhead bear with me
Whom they with weapons beat,
And of their rampinge rage
Delay the risinge heat,
Give boat to these our broils,
Releue our ruthe with rest,
Let all our sorrows sleep,
And bless us with the best.
A prayer against Iulianus.
WHatseuer fooe external threts
I way it not a rushe,
Though it be black and bluddy to,
I fear no outward pushe.
That fleshborne beast in ugly sin
That fearre our church does chase,
The deuls triumphant lustly lymme,
That plieth in each place,
That top, and tippe of mischeifes all,
Can never make me quake.
Nor all his blades bright brandishing
Can pale my visage make.
Though sword: though fire, though bests,
Do minace headlong fall,
To drown in deapes, though he alone though he,
In outrage vanquishe all
Old tyrannes fell, which bear them brag
Of torments persant keen,
Deuisinge fresh and nouel plagus,
To those which erst has been,
Of this we have to force the less:
Our patience may be more,
A only meadson we do know
And proper for this sore.
One merry victory we have,
Which can not miss the game
Our Christ who so shall dye for him
Will glorify the same.
But inward brech, and cyuill broyle
Do make me to astarte,
And quyt excludes all my force,
And vigor from my heart:
My self know not my self in trothe,
I wot not what to make.
Ne wot I what confections good
For soores unknown to take.
No wit, no reason, no good gift
Of spirit now is left,
No manner armoure against the devil
That thus inuads by theft,
And wynnes by craft, and treachery.
Who shall him now subdue,
Shall Moses preaching on the mount
A broad his hands that threw?
Who leuing them upon the rock
In shadow figurde Christ,
And proud the man of God in god
Of naught to be agrist.
So Almileke confounded was
And all his couraige Laid
Who always against the saints of God
An enemies part had plaide.
Who shall this Moses next succeade
What Joshua? what he
That of Jesus in name and dead
A figure thought shall be?
He ioyninge host with god above
Got ensigns great in war,
And through the name of Jesus he
Was victour near, and far.
With outwhose help we trust in vain:
Then David he succeads,
Or wright he verse, or cast with slinge
An happy man he speads.
Him god to battle troubles fell
In armoure did attire,
And exercisd his holy hands
In bloody banquetts dyre.
Some Samuel we wish for next
At nead to serve our turn,
Upon the alter for the folk
Freishe incence frank to burn.
To knele, and pray upon his knees,
Gods majesty to please,
A king to noynte a conqueror
Thungodly to disease.
Who worthelie with bitter tears
Our dolours can lament?
Sad Ieremye would stand in stead
With sorrows througly spent,
Who writ for Iuishe folk his Threnes
A lamentable verse,
Who prayers for our pardon can
With voice on hie reherce.
O spare us God of heaven thrice blessed,
And graciouse mark our case,
Spare us that fear* spare us thy flock
Replenishd with they grace.
Our wicked proud disdaynfull fooe
Let him not se our shame,
And let no stranger nation us
(Thy chosen people) tame.
Who else for us alive might pray
Job, Daniel, and Noe?
In prayer one, in mind all one
These three as one may gooe.
And pray that all this holy strife
At lenght might pause, and cease,
That we our selfs, might know our selfs,
And joy our own in peace:
That one an other frindly know,
And to an other speak,
And that one lynked people we
Our frindship do not break.
If Israel we have bine one,
And one in says did bide,
To Israel, and Judas now
Our selfs lets not divide.
Roboam and Jeroboam
Among us No more let be,
Jerusalem and Samary
No further let us se,
For he will visit vengfully
Our detestable strife,
We all accuse, but he discerns
Which party syns in life.
Marriage, Redemption, ^eape judgments of God.
THe knittinge best of two in one
Of all that we can find
Is weadlocke, which ingendreth flocks
And long conserueth kind.
The death of some, and birth of some
Upholdes makind in one,
A river stands by that that commes,
And fades in that that's gonne.
But after that all coasts of the earth
And bonds out streched wide
Whence winds from East, weast, North, and Sowth
Procead with puffing pride
The sons of men had over spread:
Our flesh began to frye,
With heat of sin, then plangs came one
And men their skourge did try.
Toungs sundry were distributed,
Then raynd down fiery showers,
Then came the tables, and their texts
The Prophettes shryle out powers.
But all this chaste not sin away,
It to the flesh was tide
Idolatry, wine, Lechery
Their pampringe did abide.
At lengh an other benyfit
To them from hie was sent,
From God the father, and the son
Purposed by intent.
For God which did men's bodies view
And se their heavenly mynds,
Orechargde with yearthly dreggs and dross,
Corruptyng from their kinds,
That man was servant to the feende:
To coule so ferce a fit
To other now the cuers thereof,
No more he would comitt.
Great soores, great salues. him self came down,
(His honor then forlorn)
Of heavenly syer, an heavenly prince
Among men man was he borne.
In sin not man: (which some think not,
A marvel to be spoke)
Ye came flesh forth the virgins womb
Her chastitye not broke.
Both God he came, and man he came,
Both Natures joined in oue,
This spied, that hid: a carnal man
For mortal man alone.
One God, one Christ, one man of God,
(A straungy mixture new)
The first we did despise in him
That first us over threw.
I onc receyud this heavenly soul:
Christ took both corpse, and ghost
First Adame had his will to chose,
Whilst Serpent can to bost
The aplefruyte, for which (alas)
(O hard and sharp reward)
Eternal death for him, and us
Remained still prepared.
For him that should have better seen
With pure, and ayrie light,
And was for holy things a Priest
Appointed in gods light.
Him to redeem our God was glad
In mortal body plain,
The slaughter of the mansleer
To rescue with his bane.
With gall he vanquished gulteny,
With nails the hands iniust,
Exalted hie the vanquished earth
And Adams fruyttre dust.
Old Adame to revive again
So he to quarters four
His arms out strechd and unto him
Drew all men with that power
In that one man, and with his bludde
The coasts of syne skower.
And unto us set open heaven
By conquest great of sin*
That to that holy upright hill
We might have passage in:
O king who can seek out thy sense,
And sentence so profounde?
That knows the winds, the drops of showers
And sands of all the ground.
Who can thy secret steps bewray
Of thy so close advise?
Almighty that do all things se,
And rule in dreadful wise,
Which is in all the world so wide.
Our feeble beams se the
Unperfectly as we the bulk
Of flashing lightnynge se
Which forthwith flitteth in the air:
Yet this we certain hold
That those which certain here to fore
To death and sin were soulde
By the, and by thy preciouse death
Have won a better houlde
The world us wrong and wrapped in toil
In heavy seasons past
The earth obaide their earthly prince
Blown prostrate with his blast
And fannynge fawning flattering puffs.
Now us this heavenly king
In marriage knyt from yearthly soil
To heavenly world will bring,
Of his busye and wordly affayers.
WHilst that with cares oppressed
My parents dear in extreme age,
I tender and look to,
And dolors deape with presence swage,
Me confortinge in that
I excecute mine office due,
And as me Nature binds
Perform my service loyal true.
I se me snaard in sin
For which lies open the pit of hell
And that draws me from god
Which I do think of duty well.
My corpse and pensive ghost
Continual carcking ouergoose,
And pulls me down to earth
Who erst in soul to heaven vproose.
My servants dissolute
Are hartbreake greater then I wist,
They masters hate severe,
They holy use eauen as them list,
To masters shape unkind,
To gentle masters thieves unjust,
Still steeringe up our wrath,
And to revenge excess of lust.
Our Fathers goods at home,
Our Ke^^rs burdens great abroad,
For taxes, and for toules
We pricked are as neete with goade.
With mercments hard exact,
The richemans fredome from him flies,
In thraldom lies his tongue,
A bout his stock the chatchpole plyes.
The judges keep aloaft
Fatt placed soft one benches hie,
Of comynalls a world
For speady justice houle, and cry.
To counteriarring pleas,
Our casis tiede, as ruled law,
The simple they inlincke,
Wide nets they weue, and far them throw.
For this they sweet, and swelt,
For this they taulke, for this they toil,
To tread down truth for gain.
By skules they skudde, and rownyng roll,
The seriaunt sittes at bar
To either part he will be soulde,
The worst man is the beast
If most he have to give of goulde.
Who can go by these trapps?
Who from their snares by sleight can slide,
In these so peruest times,
Unless that god become his guide?
Or to the wicked sort
He must leave wealth, and wicked gain:
Or with the soil of sin
His soul, and self must total stayne.
As if thou stand at fire
Which fast has spread forth pitchy smoke.
Or thereof thou shall smell
Or stifled sent will make the choke.
From Egypt and Babylon to the holy Land.
Fly black Egiptus land,
Fly Pharo, and his godless prankes:
A contry seake above,
Leave captyue fields, and Babills banks,
Delight not near the fludde
In shady places to he found,
Love not that warblinge harp
Ne yet their Musickes doolefull sound.
Thy dame Assiriase yoke,
Abandon bouldly forth of hand.
Make have with swift exployte
To retche the bands of holy land.
A plot at last survey
When long thy temple firm may stand*
That land I whilom lost,
Whilst long I seek it morning soore,
About my head poor wretch
A bushe of hear hanges whitly hoore.
From Sodom to the mount,
WHo runs his race forth right
Thrice happy man of all is he,
Nor Sodom brent to dust
For vggly sin looks back to se
But cuntry soil forgettes,
And postinge hies to mountain rock,
Lest he a block of salt
Be made, and to the world a mock.
Conflict of flesh and spirit
AYe me who unto heaven and saints
So glad, and feign would go
But bide in wouen wrethed still
Within this corpse of woe.
So diverse is this daungrous life,
So raging ruffles sin,
I know of saftye harbowre none
To shrowde my body in.
So soden coursinge cares come on,
With such posthast they speade,
My joy, my comfort and my heart
They eat up as they feade.
But lose my God, and set me free
From these my earthly bonds,
And place me pressed among thy saints
Amide thy heavenly stronds*
A brething to God.
Look up my soul, contemn
That earth which does the so impound,
Least that with pays of sin
My carcass plowng the grouffe to ground
Short is this bliss of life,
As that which dream a sunder knapps.
Time as it tumbles on
Brings heavy heaps of hurtful haps,
A puerer world there is,
Which aye shall be, and ever was,
A liuly life to live,
A place of pleasance sweet to pass*
The world vyolent.
Dear world, not truly dear*
Why roulst thou me arownde so fast,
As though against my will
I whurled were with whurlewind blast.
Much like the little Ante,
Who though it does with stand it stout
By force of greater strength.
Is easy drawn, and dragd about.
My soul comes from above
Compact I was of earth and air,
My corpse comes from beneath,
My ghost from gods mouth yssude fair.
With dangers great I strive
Which partly harm me through my fooes,
And this rebelliouse flesh
Does partly eke increase my wooes.
O world I end my days,
Preserve my flock from ieopardy,
As delphin fysh in land,
So in the air behold I dye.
Better to dye, or to live.
AS in the air the fowls,
As in the sea the shipp,
So run I out my race,
So time away does trippe,
Nothing does certain bide,
But that which we do sin,
Such is the heavy hap
That we are lapped in,
I like it not to live,
As ill I like to dye,
In both respects I quake.
If thou demand me, why?
My sins are grown so great
They ouerlode my head
And worse they would me plague
Alas if I were dead.
This life is such a lump,
So massye to sustain,
And when thou ghost from hence,
Thou ghost to further pain.
Of both sides fear is great,
The beast that I can find,
Is Christ to fly to the
To try thy mercy kind.
Vnlodge the devil.
Away from me all finds
Al spirittes that work my smart,
For God is dinted deape,
And grayled in my heart,
Begone lest I forgooe
Of mind the stedy stay,
Ye masters of the earth
Be trudginge hence away,
Mortifying.
With care, with fastings, prayers,
With watching much and liuelonge toil
These our dysloyall lymmes
We ought to tame and put to foil.
Art thou an honest man?
Thy self to pass contend thou still
Unhonest art thou yet?
Content therefore to be less ill:
But Hypocrites do rain
Those after god will cut away
And for there glosinge life
With pain he will them sharply pay.
The strouted streched flesh
And heavy belly agrauate
Will scarcely get to heaven
So strayt, and narrow is the gate:
The felicity of a Christian is Christ.
LEt others gape for gould
And follow banquet huffinge cheer,
Which in short life is short,
So gliding, sliding, outworne gear?
For pastures, and for paks,
For grownd, and grain let others prodd,
And let them eke command
Their Satin suytes and silks at nodde.
Let me have only Christ,
Whom I in soul may perfitt se,
What sever else their is
I pray the take it world to the.
The life miserable, and sin unquiet.
WHy sends thou me o Christ
Within this flesh my soul to tire,
Into this gastfull life,
And dongeon drent in deadly mire?
If that man be a god
As in some points he is (they say)
Then, god, I am thy lote,
And sole on the my life does stay.
My knees have lost their strength,
Unpuysant are my members all,
Me age, and great disease,
And carcke, and heavy frinds make fall,
Yet sin does not abate
But me it fast pursues apase,
As when to eat their flesh
The dog, the Hare, or heart does chase.
Or gentle stay this grief,
Or me a man forworne sustain,
From warfare me unwind,
And sone acquyt from present pain,
Let darkness good induce
Forgetfulness unto my brain,
The vanity of this lyef A passage unto God.
WHy bore my Mother me,
Why bore she me into this woo.
Into this thorny day
Alas the day, why did she so?
If that she felt no care,
Nor ever in her flesh felt fraye,
An happy one was she,
Begotten in a lucky day.
But if her storms were stearne,
If many times, and soore she fought,
Against her will it was
(I think) that me to world she brought.
All men have now their trades
And sundry lives they thick pursue,
He shreds the earth with share,
And he with shipp, the waters blue,
He hunteth, and he hawks,
And he in cheualry delights,
He learns the muses art
And vaunting verses fresh indites.
And he by plays and prancks
By seafold scorns by terms, and tricks
Aduances him for price,
And fast the fees of men he lickes:
But Christ is my reward,
My fee is long corosyue care,
And soiorning disease
That maks my carcass lancke, and spare.
Care cruche me for a time
Me cruche and crouse, nor on me rue,
In time I shall be well,
And bidd all care and carke adue.
The knowledge of the Trynitie is blesfulnesse:
WHy bore my mother me
That god I can not fully know,
Nor eauen so as I would
His praise I can not full out blow?
The brightsome leamynge light
Of Godhead daseleth quyte my breast,
Thee smalest part thereof
Not fully in my skill does reast,
The light conuayes it self
I morn, nor can it perfect feel,
No more then leven I know
Which down from heaven does headlong reele.
But if above (o Lord)
I face to face shall look on the
I will not blame my dame,
O happy then, and well is me.
O son of god me save
And take me from this bitter mire,
And make me happy with
Of latter life the happy hire:
Where I shall se the plain
And seeing plain tryumphe aloude
And not in parcill wise
Thus still suruay the in a cloud.
A prayer for quiet death.
King Christ the light of men,
And pilloure bright of Gregory,
To me that straggling straye
And wilsom wander far, and nigh
Stay tyrante Pharao,
Do by his hand (o Christ) I pray
Stay those exactinge devils
Which on us tasks so felly lay.
And from this Egypt yoke
And from this mud, that does us soil,
Kidd us, and from this plague,
So full of death, and trudginge toil.
Give us a passage good,
And quiet saffe address our way,
If that our fooe arise,
And give assault to make us stay,
Then to us fearful folk
In have the read sea swift divide,
That on the sands dryshodde
Twixt walls of waves we glade may glyde.
Forth to the holy land,
And cuntry coasts that long shall duer,
Which thou Christ gauste to us
To have, and houlde saffe standing suer.
That true may be thy word,
Wherein we only put our trust,
Then which nothing we think
To be more stable, and more just.
The strangers fountaynes sweet,
And brokes of pleasance them imbarre,
Put by their threatening braggs
And doleful war set from them far.
So when the sacred soil
We shall enjoy reposd at ease,
With carrouls goodly sweet
We ever will the praise, and pleese.
Final repentance All is vanity.
MY end of life is come
A shipman I the main has past,
For me does now remain*
Due for my sins a bitter blast.
The vggly shade of hell,
Fercefyers, and darksome profound night,
Now all my crimes must come
And be detected bare in light.
But in this latest act
Rue on me Christ, and stand me nigh,
And now my neadfull want
(O Savior dear) do thou supplye.
I suffer in my soul,
And troblouse fears do me agrize
That anger thine on me
Should fall in wrekful woofull wise.
Feign would I pass from pains,
That so my heart consume and eat
And carry hence with me,
My busy destnyes dreadful great.
But dying unto you
Which after me survive behind
I do protest with faith,
And tell you truly as I find,
Believe me (dear my frinds)
There is no profit of this life,
The death there of does bring
A lasting life deuoide of strife.
A repulse to the devil A passage to heaven A Farewell to the world
DEpart thou from my breast
A way thou subtle devil, and slye
Depart thou from my life,
And from my body by and by,
Thief, Serpent, Bellyall, Fire,
Beast, gaper Dragon, death, and vice,
Thou Frensy, darkness, night
That into guile do all intyce.
Inchaunter, full of spite,
That do in murder pleasure much,
Our parents that vndost
With sin, and death and pestlence such.
Go get the to the seas
Christ's so commands, or to the rocks
As did the legion once,
Take up thy rome in swinishe flocks.
Forlorn, be faringe hence,
The death of Christ will else the pay,
That death in all my parts
That death in all my heart does stay,
Christ's death before my fete,
The death of Christ is all my joy,
Thou crafty will thou not
Surceasse to work me mor annoye?
Will thou not go aside?
Will thou not fling the headlong down
On Sodom set thine eyes
That now for sin dispeopled town,
To lewd blasphemouse flokes
The Godhead great that proud despise
Begone, and do not vex
My hoary head in tempting wise.
With thy malignaunt thought
Thou makst my mind both black and bloe,
Wilt nether thou for me,
Nor yet for God will thou hence gooe?
Gods will does the discharge
No more thou can be gonne thou pelf,
Thy license is exspirde,
Think not to make me like thy self.
Now must I march to heaven,
Up to the Threshoulds pure, and fine
With fresh, and gloriouse light
My novel life must show, and shine.
To god aloft in skies.
Advance I do my heaued hand,
Receive my god my soul
Among troops of thine where bright thou stands.
I dyinge leave a flock,
And pray that (world) thou would them spare
Fare well to the (o world)
World Fare the well, full freyght with care:
A good beginning, a good endir
That each good act that's well begone
Does luckely fall out,
That does the end advertise the,
When it is brought about.
Constancy is crowned.
A life that had beginning good,
And ends as it began,
Does endid bring an endless life,
And deifye a man,
Hie speakinge.
Be furnished well to speak, or else*
In speech mount not to hie:
The bird will have her feathers first,
Ere she assaye to fly.
Use and Abuse.
The greatest ornament to life
Is knowledge used right.
Abused knowledge is again
Most yrcksome unto sight.
Vain glory.
Let not vain glory move the ought
Or wind the in with wyle
The simplest man the sooner she
Gyues onsett to beguil.
Continuance.
In workynge well contynnue still,
And never look thou back,
The course lies easy unto sin,
If once thou ginne to slack.
Laughter, anger, babbling
Laughe not, control thine anger swift,
To anger be thou slow,
An idle, and unthrifty word
Thy lips let them not know.
Duty to God, parents, priests* and Elders.
Fear god, and to thy parents kind
An humble duty pay,
The priests, and elders reverence
Whose heads with hoare do swaye.
Parents and Children.
The son with syer to be at law,
And brablinge to contend,
That wrightings, and that Natures laws
For bid, and discommende.
Such like.
What thou in no wise can abide
To suffer in an other.
That thou in no wise work, or wish
Unto thy Christian Brother.
Proportion.
Great tortour is not great to him,
That greatly does offend:
The laws do leuye like to like,
And like to like do lend.
The tongue.
A Tongue well spoken utters out
Of hoony words a fludde,
The foolyshe mouth does utter much.
But utters little good.
Language.
Forth out the wise man's witty mouth,
Proceeds language sweet,
Forth bitter chaps full brabling words,
Do inshue matched mete.
Haples frindles.
The rich man's house knows no poor frinde,
Nor frindeth any such.
The rich man's house is frindly aye
To him that has as much.
Drunkenness.
Small single drink does not insoft
The vigor of the mind,
But belly fat* and drunken noule
Does change the from their kind.
VVynde.
Who does suppose unruly winds
To keep a measure just
Which taken eftsons do vprayse
A soft ungodly lust?
A fat belly, a lean wit.
A gorrell paunche, and godly mind
In one may hardly lie,
Things contrary we plainly so
Drive out the contrary
Thriftye diet.
A diet thin does profit more
Then that, thou do devise
Upon they Beade, contriuinge it
In coastly dainty wise.
Fools wise,
The frantike fool, for dreams does think
Him self more wiser man,
Then he which thousands many one
His own distribute can.

I rather wish in will,
Thus am I sole, but so should I
Have company of ill.
A milking sheparde.
The hungry pastor let him milk
(Yea) goots to fill his mawe,
But for sweet milk in strayning hard
Mere blood he shall out draw.
Order.
The hog when he at trowighe does spy
His drafe approchyng near,
Betakes him self unto his rome
And keps no further steer.
Order.
The dissolute, and obstinate
By force of law compel.
That they the laws do right observe,
And what becomes them well.
Order.
Among beasts which grouling feed on ground,
Upon their forage rude,
Among kenell vile of houling dogs
And order their is shewde.
Man, death.
To mortal men cut of by death
The earth is comen grave.
First earth he was, now earth he is,
And him the earth must have.
The good fear not.
Observing law thou may at ease
Set fear of law aside:
For he that bideth in the law,
In fear neads not to bide.
VVisdome vanquisheth.
The practisd Pilote can eschew
Both wrack of wave and wind
Against haples hap the happy wise
Best present help can find.
Perseueraunce.
Those means eschew which lead not to
The right, and perfect way:
For error easy bendes to vice.
And speady works decay.
VVisdome is strong.
Not heavy thumpes, or hamers hard
Do move at all a stithe,
To bear all bruntes a steadfast mind
Has puisance strong, and pithe.
Bugges fraye fools.
Each crackeling lefe the Leueret skars,
And some such fools we find,
That every bushe, and every blast
Does skarre them from their mind.
The poor giving.
Those poor I hate to noble men
Which give their presents gaye.
Who words again, and many words,
And only words repaye.
The lawyer
The wicked Lawyer with his law
The law, and realm does mayme,
The upright Lawier with his law
Does rule and save the same.
The Tutour of the Fatherles.
The neadles chuffe that laugheth at
The Orphans tricklyng tears,
Does laugh at Gods own vengfull ire,
An God his laughter hears.

He goose the redyest way of all
The law for to distroye,
Who does the meaning of the law
And sentence true annoye.
Diversity.
The poor man has to mind his meat.
His stomach for to plye,
The rich has much, and forces not
But still to more does hye.
Instruction of fools.
Instruct a fool persevere still,
Nor ever him forsake,
Though hope be small, such hap may be
Thou shall him wiser make
Chastninge.
By stroke of stele the hardest flynte
Is forcd to flynge out fire,
A stony breast through discipline
To virtue will aspire.
An oath
If thou do swear, or if through the
An other man does swear,
Both thou do ill, and he does ill,
And both the law do tear.
Treasure.
Hurde treasure fast, but treasure such
Which end shall never taste,
All worldly treasure in the end
Shall suffer wrack, and wast.
Short pleysure.
Easteme not that, nor compte of it
Which time to the has brought,
For that which time erected has,
That time will bring to naught
Pleasure chaungable.
Pleasure is pretye for a time
Dilightfull unto all.
But as she came she ouercasts*
As whurlyng as a bal.
Shamefastness in women.
A woman's corpse, nor mannishe moade
Nor mannishe tricks besitt,
There modesties a sober moade,
And shamefastnes does fit.
Health.
In sickness naught more wishd then health,
That happily Nature spies
And therefore hunteth after health,
And after health she hies.
Bablinge.
A madd man's words are veary like
The seas roughe raginge roore,
Which still does beat upon the banckes
But nothing moist the shore.
Bribes.
That wise men arre that's moneys work.
Bribes has their heart in hold,
A bird is caught with twisted hemp,
A man is caught with gould.
A sadd spirit.
Care brings age before his time,
And that which age does bring
Before the time, no tract of time
The same away can wringe.
Riches.
The servant swift of vice is welthe,
All powers with headye swaye,
To mischiues auckward do decline,
And leads to loss away.
Frendeshyp.
A trusty frinde is treasure best
In honor, and distrese,
No person lewd for any cause
In frendshippe do possess.
Care.
The careful breast deuoures the bones,
A merry pleasant mind
Does keep the body fat, and fayer
Conserved in his kind.
Temperance in abundance.
Abundance can not shun excess,
The mean it can not keep.
For fire inflamd, and full in course
A way does swiftly swepe.
Wine.
The mind, and wit is feabled sore
By to much beluyng wine,
For fire the more that it is fed
More fully it does shine.
Fear of judgment.
He that of judgment stands in awe
His wrath does better tame.
For those that judge of wrath it self,
In wrath will judge the same.
Affliction to affliction.
Hard case it is to add more ill
To him whom ills oppress
Yet one ille often by proof we try
An other does redress.
Lasting glory.
Eternal glory, lasting fame
To conquer let us cast,
For that which hear we scrambling k
Ore casts as a blaste.
Anger an il counsailer.
That counsel practice not where to
Thy wrath does the inthrall
For that which wrath does counsel the
No counsel is at all.
Ill women.
The dragon has his noisome ill,
The Adder has his smarte,
The Adders smart, the Dragons ill,
Does dwell in woman's heart.
Mark the end.
The skulles of dead, the heads of quick
Apparent bald and bare,
Do prove that that will us forsake.
For which we carcke, and care.
Such father such child.
A young crabbe if he crepe awrye
With foul untoward pace,
Did not the Breader so likewise
What judge you in this case?
Like of like.
When Nature shall reuelt from kind
And bridle glad her moade,
Then shall the scholmaister that's badde,
Bring forth his scholars good.
Beauty and Pity.
With diverse godly ornaments
Thy corpse, and mind imbroyde,
Despise not thou the fatherles,
Nor let them be distroide
Gods blessyng.
If God do lardgly give increase*
No envy can prevail,
If god withdraw his rich increase,
No travail can avail.
Order and power.
Set more by order then by power,
For order that aright
Uphouldeth power, has in it self,
A greater power, and might.
Dreading, and melling,
They that in other matters mell,
And others chances dread
In dreadinge dangers not there own,
Their proper dread do speade.
The law of like.
Why do thou viper pain abhor
In bringing forth thy young?
Assay what throws had once the womb
Whereof thy self art spronge.
The stout are gloriouse.
None ever yet in any world
Renowned was for fear
For conquests stout, and bargings stout
Do strike up glory clear
Dreams.
The want of sleep ingenders dreams,
Then sleep that can not spy.
A thing it self, in vision sees
A broken fantasy.
Handling of rebels.
Force only rebels can persuade,
Force rebels does restrain,
Force can subdue, and rule prescribe
To hugie Giaunts main
The people a beast of many heads.
The headles people bearyng swaye
Some skilles prince does rain,
The people is of all good things
Confusion platt, and plain.
An idle work.
An Idle work to be a work
Who could or can devise,
Which each wiseman by better right
As foolish will despise?

Man's Rethorique pleads mumme,
For gould can pithily persuade
Though it in speech be dumme.
VVorldly peace.
Hear they may live at their hearts ease.
And take a worldly rest,
Which dote upon the wicked world,
And like her chaffer best.
Frinde and fooe.
A frind by all possible means
His frind will gladly pleasure.
The fooe is he, that hurts his fooe
Without just cause, and measure.
Light shipping.
Swyme balauncd lightly in the sea,
Not over full of freight,
Lest thou an ouerloden barcke
Do sink, or brast for weighte
Musing of death.
Remember ever death at hand
Think still upon thy grave
So thou of death, when she shall strike
The less of dread shall have.
The mind a Temple.
Rear up to God within thy mind
A Temple builded well,
So God the Lord, of Heaven, and earth
At home with the will dwell.
Know thy self.
Know well thy self, and what thou art,
And how thou first began
So shall thou know the ofspringe first
And brittle state of man.
The steadfast mind.
The days turmoyle us swift in vain,
From light to novel light
The man of God theternall light
Has placed in his sight.
Vanyties.
On things which swiftly come and gooe
If thou thy trust repose,
So may thou trust the bubbes of fluddes,
Which swiftly comes, and gooes.
Deades and words.
Like error count it to offend
In living and in talk:
When once thy tongue has troade awrye
Thy life awry will walk.
Holy orders, relics.
Its wickedness that wicked men
Should holy orders take:
Of relics, and relligiouse bones
The worship formde forsake.
The path of virtue.
Tread out the tract of life well lead,
Sincke not but stand up still,
If thou woulds stand stand not within
Their threshoulds who be ill.
Of sevnge: The stepps of the devil.
He sees not, who sees not that
That sin bread smart in space,
We know the devil not by his face,
But note him by his trace*
The sick man feleth not.
The pacient sick his danger deape
If that he will not tell:
Him urgent force of present death
From life will sone expel.
Words and works.
Let words be thine, and works be mine,
The cursed liver vile
Stands neade of praising blasing words,
And pledars pleasant guyle.
Idleness.
Sloth breadeth lust, and therefore thou
Have ever what to do,
Lest that thy light unconstant mind
Do waver to and fro.
Treasure standing.
Be rich in God, those riches vain
Which in this world we find,
Are very like the cobwebbes which
The spiders weak have twinde.
Virtue passing.
This world has naught that worthy is
Why longer we should live,
Except those graces we respect,
Which virtue sole does give.
Faith.
Let us keep close our faith in heart,
Nor vauntingly it sell,
The one is easy washd away,
The other long does dwell.
The mean.
Be not to just, be not to wise,
Extremes of all things fly,
Shun both extremes, and that pursue
Which twixt the twain does lie.
Boldness with discretion.
Except thou rule thy stomach ferce
It never will be stout:
The discret wise most worthy things
Most bouldly bring about.
Law and Lawyer.
The laws of God peruse in breast
So shall thou be in fee:
Retainde of him whose laws and sawes
Of heavenly virtue be.
Please and displease.
Be good thy self, and whom thou oughst
Those franckly do contempne,
And for to please the godles crew
As shameful that condemn.
Wary in praising.
Thy self well lyvde, the wicked sort
Thou can not well commend
For all will think that thine own life
To path unclean will bend.
Duresse tries.
Adversity does try the good
As gold is tried by flames
The well disposed persons hurtes
Do never turn to shame.
Denying of Father.
He that his father does deny
Denies not him alone,
For by the father God did work
As causes ioynde in one.
A good name a good possession.
Mothes eat up all: thy goods with thee
In tumbe shall not be cladde,
At death thine only honor is
A good name to have had.
Spare strangers, and the dead.
Spare strangers much, but more the^ spare
Which hence are gone away,
And left behind them what they had,
Them selfs inclosde in clay.
An other life.
In Gods name, leave and quite forsake
The world and worldly vayles,
And up to skies with course direct
And courage speade thy sails.
The Trinity, the fountain.
The ishue of all honest acts
From God must have their course,
The thrice and most blessed trinity
Of goodness well, and source.
Man's life.
This course of guilfull life
Which flitteth forth of hand
A top is little suer,
And little like to stand,
It rouleth up side down,
It runs without redress,
When most it semes to stay
It so much stays the less,
We hold it but in flight,
It fades when it bides,
It skipping sone is paste,
Yeat hard at last it slides,
It draws, and eke redrawes
With it a stackring state,
We may discriue it thus,
Which realeth in this rate,
This raging reastles life,
So changing eury hour,
A dream, a smother light,
Of grass a fleting flower.
A christian life.
Each Christian man becomes
Tears, watching, toyll* and pain
And rage of strong affectes
In glouing heart do strain,
His belly to imbarre
To Christ him to inthrall,
To mind the latter day,
And trembling quake withal.
FINIS.
