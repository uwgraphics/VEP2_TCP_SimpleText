The book entytuled the next way to heaven the which in true walky^ge or
goy^nge is but three days Journey / and to go or walk every day but three
miles as witnesses moses who says. Ibimus viam trium dierum in solitudinem.

When I behold the estate and life yt I have been of syns yt I could know ye
good and the ill I ne find but sy^nes and time lost and if I any good deeds
have done yet are they not dygne ne worthy of guerdon / for I them have done so
neclygently without love and without advise. And it seems me / and also I doubt
me yt they all ne be^ any thing worth. Alas such am I wherefore I doubt lest
yt I be cut down and cast in to ye fire. That is to say yt I be not after
this present life put unto death and cast in to ye fire of hell with yt deuilles
and with my sy^nes. Alas I have wasted of goods and lost for to norysshe my
caryon more than I have won. Certes I am not worthy to be called man or woman
/ for I have led a right foul life and poor. And for as much I have shame
to live / and also I dare not dye. Alas now should I weep all the time of my
life for to recover the time that I have lost. Alas body sinner what thynkest
thou / know thou not well that one time it behooves yt to dye / and also thou
ne know wha^ ne how. Know thou not well yt ye Judgment of god aprocheth
/ certes yes. O what anguysshe shall that be unto the evil parsones to se a
day full of derknesses of sorrows of trybulacyons / of cryenges / and
brayenges of wepynges / and of waylynges / and of dredes of abasshe mentes of
eclepses and of thonders / of tempest / and of ire / and of other great and
horrible things. O yt there shall be hard tidings and bitter. O what heaviness
/ o what dolor / alas what thy^kest thou slepest thou / or wakest thou what
abydest thou. Alas that thou art on sleep when thou tremblest not to here so
great thonder. Alas dry tree worthy to be cut and put in the fire / tell me
have thou any fruit / ye may thou say much y^ll and roten / for sin is
bitter and stynkynge. Alas here is an evil life where as I have left ye
command mentes of god and have obayed unto the commandments of the world
/ not unto ye world all only / but unto ye world unto flesh / and unto the
devil. God yt created unto his image / and redeemed and governed from day to
day. And promyseth to give unto the his realm / and it is he without whom
thou ne may live / and also thou have done unto him so great dyspleasure wha^
thou have not dayned to obey unto him / but have loved more derly to obey unto
the world / unto the flesh / and unto the devil / A it is no little thing
how be it that it seems un to the so. Alas what shalt thou say at ye day of
Judgment when all ye time that thou have lived shall be demanded how thou have
spent it. For it has be lent ye for to employe in the service of god thy
creatoure. Alas wenest thou that it be now time to go to play to laugh to
bourde to speak trifles / cextes nay / But it is time to plain and to weep and
to enchase and flee from sins and to plant virtues / and to do good works.
And after this life it shall betyme to play / and that is in a fair delectable
place. Now prove I ye than that it behooves to yield account every hour of
every momente of time syns that you were borne till unto thy depatynge. And
there at ye Judgment before god before ye vyrgyn Marye and aungelles / and all
the say^tes and before all the world And there shall be serched and demanded
all that / that thou haste done against the will of god. And also unto ye shall
be showed all the good deeds that you have left undo ne the which thou sholdest
have done if by penance it ne had be pardoned the. And that thou shalt be well
set

The next way to heaven. about with sin / if thou weep them not now by
confession / contrycyon / and satysfaccyon. And than shalt you reknowlege
Justice and mercy and so shalt rest for than prayer / service / promise /
force / gifts excusacyons ne fair speech / ne penance in no wise may help
/ ne no thing ben of valor / and than shall these sinners se the Just Judge
out of mesure wroth and ready to do Justice without mercy. And under shall they
se the deep helles open to engloute them / and more than an hundred thousand
tourmentes the which be made ready unto them And on their right hand they
shall se all their sins whereof they shall have meruayllously great hydour /
and on the left hand they shall se these enemies horrible and much cruel in
their terryble and hydeous form awytynge that the sentence of the Judgment
be yielded and cast upon the sinners to the end that thy may draw them with
them in to hell. And also they shall se the tire enflambed without forth. And
also they shall feel their conscience bre^ne without forth. Alas if thou be
than of the nombre of sinners what cou^tenau^ce shalt you make were may you
hyde the / the which now ne may here the word of god / certes in no
part. But it behooves the to appear will thou or not / and shalt abide the
dolorous sentence. Alas what shalt you than do / thou shalt than tremble / for
now begin our souls to tremble yet dyspayre the not / but return unto him
the which you have wretchedly offended and pray him humbly yt he will have of
the pity and mercy / and that he will give the pardon. And have thou good hope
in his mercy / and he shall receive the with good will / for he receives
gladly the sinners when they return toward him by ye way of penance / ye
which way has three days Journey in length / as ye may here here after in
this present book as says saint Peter of Lucembourgh.

Saint Peter says that we ben all pilgrims in this world here. And we walk
day and night with our resting in to our country the which is in heaven. And for
to have recreacyo^ as these pilgrims the which speken with good will in
walking their way. Also in going unto our pilgrimage / that is paradyse / we
shall speak alytell / for we walk strongly and we have not but three days
Journey to walk ye one of the said three days Journey is co^trycyon / and the
other co^fessyon the third is satisfaccyon. And in likewise says Moses unto
us. Ibimus viam triu^ dieru^ solitudine. The first should be contrycyon / that
days Journey has three leges or miles from thens to walk. The first lege or
mile is dolor of heart of that / that by his sin man has deserved the gybet
of hell. The second mile is called dolor of heart of that / that he has
lost the great Joy of paradyse. The third mile is dolor of heart and great
dyspleasaunce of that / that a man has offended god. Certes these three miles
should be right anon gone unto a good walker or goer. Example / if a man were
taken for any evil yt he has done / as if he had been taken in his theft and
condemned unto ye death and men led him unto the gybet / and that ye king
met him and him demanded friend wheder do they led the. And he answers.
Sir they led me to be hanged because I am a thief. Also I have well deserved
it for the euylles yt I have done. And the king answered unto the thief. I
have pity of the / and if thou will promise me that thou shall do no more so
as you have done in times paste and that thou be sorry of that thou haste
deserved to be hanged I shall deliver the. I believe that he should be right
Ioyefull So should he be anon at the first mile. And other example how a man
ouercomen among thieves the which have robbed him of his goods / and is left
poor. And in that the king meteth him and him demanded Frynde how is it with
the. And he answers right ill for I have been robbed and have lost all my
good. And the king say the unto him / friend be thou sorry of that that thou
have lost thy goods and I shall yield it the and yet more he should be more
glad than before. That is to say that ye sinner should be sorrowful of that
/ that he has lost paradyse by his sins. Now may ye demau^ de me and say /
ye say that coutrycyon yeldeth again all the goods. And I have lost my
vyrgynyte / how shall contrycyon yield it me. Friend I answer the that if you
have lost two grotes or two nobles and if Iyelde unto the again six thou
haste well recovered thy loss. Example a maser of marbyt ye which is broken
has lost his beauty in his ancyente / but it may be in such wise made again
that it shall be more dear than before by ye gold and the silver wherewith it
shall be anourned. And so I say the yt if thou have lost thy vyrgynyte the
beauty of thy vyrgynyte ne may be recovered / but you may so repair it and
aourne it by so noble virtues that it shall be better and more rycher than it
was before. Example of Magdaleyne and of Marie egypcyen the which them anourned
so well and of so noble virtues so rychely that they were more worthy after
tha^ before. Be thou than sorrowful of that that thou have lost thy vyrgynyte
and ye goods of grace and paradyse shall be yielded unto the as it is said. And
this is the sconde mile of this Journey. And other example / a clerk served a
bishop ye which should give him a benefyce / but ye said clerk left his
service of the bishop / and yode to serve an other master and lost the love
of the bishop. And than the bishop said unto the clerk / thou have wrathed
me / but if thou will be sorry thou shalt have my love as thou had before
/ and I shall give the the benefyce ye I have promised to give the / should not
he be anon sorry of that I by leave that yes. And in like wise is it if thou
wrath god by thy sin thou sholdest have contricyon and make thy peace. And
our lord shall give unto the the realm of paradyse. And this is the third
mile of this Journey and in ye end of that here sholdest thou make thy gyste
and rest the / but it suffyseth not to be sorry of that / that thou have evil
done and that thou have deserved to be in hell ne of that / that thou haste
lost paradyse / but for yt / that thou haste lost the love of god thy good
lord. Example if thou haste wrought with Peter and when the even tide shall
come thou go unto John^ to demand thy wages / and John^ shall answer the.
My friend he with whom ye have wrought shall pay the thy wages and not I.
Have thou not herd say / who so set the to work let him pay the. And in
like wise may god say at ye death of the man in Judgment of him / the which
shall be repentau^t only for the dread of hell and for the love of paradyse to
have it all only and shall say my friend go thou in to hell and take there thy
reward for thou leftest not for to do the evil for the love of me / but
witout more for the dread of hell / where our lord shall say / speak unto
hell that he help the and socoure the / if he may / for I am not holden to
help the at thy need for thou ne haste done the good deeds that thou haste
done for the love of me / but you have done them for to have paradyse all only
and for dread of hell / and so than you sholdest do ye good deeds for to get
the love of god / and not for dread above all of thy dampnacyon. And so go thou
the three mile above said / and ye shall rest in ye end of the third. That is
to say that he should be sorry of that / that he has deserved to have hell and
lost paradyse / but in especyal above all things sorry of that / that he has
lost ye love of god by his sin. A man should seek co^trycyon entyerly so that
he may find it. And after to have the love of god his creator. And not to do
as did the man ye which abode to confess him till unto the death / and than he
cried contrycyon contrycyon wheder are ye gone. And so he ne might find it
and know you that it was true Justice of god. For saint Gregory says. It is
good reason yt god forgyte him or her at the death / the which in his life en
health forgyteth god and leueth. Repent we than in as much as we ben in good
health and in life and god shall pardon us with good will / and it is the first
Journey

THe second Journey of paradyse is confession. Few people can well walk that
Journey without going out of the way / And it is no marvel / for how may
he be a good clerk the which ne goes / but one time in the year to the scole
/ and yet right well aduysed ne with great pain may he be a good work man yt
which has his craft. The good clerk ryseth up for to study by night / and
in like wise should we do for to learn this science. And in like wise did ye
holy prophet Dauyd as it is said in the psalter. Media necre surgebam. I arose
up said he at mydnyght for to confess my sins / for to advise me when I
shall goo to confess me. That is against those the which go to confession
without advise. The right enter of co^fessyon is I confess me unto god / unto
the vyrgyn Marye / and unto all the saints of paradyse / and unto you sir ye
which are in gods stead and vycayre. This first word I confess me closes
hell unto the sinner and opens unto him paradyse ye which was shette unto
him by his sin and so has peace with god and shetteth the mouth of ye priest
werof men read unto that purpose an example.

A Rich man fader of the curate of the town spoke vilany unto a poor man /
and the poor man ne might venge him presently / but tarried till that ye rich
man yode unto ye feldes for to se his corns al alone and the poreman ye which
se him come took the coultre of his ploughe and slew the rich man. And after
he yode to lead his ploughe / and no man wist who it should be. Afterward a
great while it happened that the poor man had repentance of his mysdede and
yode to confess him to his curate the which was yt sone of the said rich man
that he had slain. And as he confessed him the curate apperceyued well that he
had some sin in his conscience that he durst not tell / wherefore he said to
hy^ My friend hardely tell all thy sins / for there is none so great but that
god may well pardon after that a man him require mercy / and also in that ye I
may I shall help the and I shall pardon ye. And than said ye poor man, Ha sir
I am the cursed man the which has murdered your fader so by such manner / and
for that cause I confess unto god and unto you sir in requyrynge pardon and
absolucyon. Than the priest changed his blood for nature / but he ne made no
semblaunt and pardoned unto the good man with good heart the death of his father
/ and after ward the curate showed unto the poor man great token of love more
by half than he was wont in so much yt his wife apperceyued it well / and so
him demanded by many times what it was to say that ye curate comes so often
to se the / and that he unto the shows so great token of love. And so
oftentimes him demanded that he told her and compted ye trough wherein he did
as a fool. Now it happened ye he was wroth with his wife and would beat her.
Than she escryed him and lepte in to the mids of the street and said in
cryenge out / out the thyfe the murdrer he would slay me as he has done the
fader of our curate. And than the children and parents of ye deed man when
they herd that / that she had said they ran all with pykes and swerdes for
to slay the poor man. When he them apperceiued he lepte hastly upon a mare yt
he had and fled. And in fleing he met the curate comy^ge on horsbacke ye
which came to ward the town and said unto him / my fair sone how is it with
the / wheder ghost thou so hastly / and the poor man told him shortly ye
cause wherefore he fled. A said ye curate my friend come down from thy mare
anon and lepe upon my horse which goes more swiftly to the end that thou may
escape fro my parents the which follow the. Than the poor man lepte upon the
curates horse and fled. And that hanging his friends came the which followed
the good man ye which said unto him. A falls traytoure you have well hyd the
murdre of your father and he has told it you in confession. A fair lords
said the curate ye have wrong who has told you such thing I know no
thing / but I know well that he is one of the good and well dysposed me^ of
this parysshe^. And they answered velye / ye know it well / but ye have ever
more hydit unto us. And yet now have thou taken unto him thy horse for to escape
from us and from our hands / and also ye have taken his mare the priest
excused him evermore and also excused the poor man / and so much that they
were wroth with him in such wise that they slew the said curate / and so ye
se will by this example how this word I confess me closes the mouth of the
priest. Now ye shall here wherefore a man says unto god almighty unto the
blessed vyrgin Mary and unto all saints. The reason is such. Our lord has
two courts / the one is of Justice and ye other of mercy. And the devil dare
not lay hand on the sinner till unto such time that he be delyuerd unto him
And the devil comes unto the court of Justice for to accuse ye poor and
miserable sinner. And Justice answers. I believe the not for thou art a lier.
Than answers the devil. I have good witnesses dygne of faith and of credence
without any reprofe / that is to know all the trynyte of paradyse / the vyrgyn
Marye and all ye holy saints / and his good angel before whom he has done
his sins / but for me they ne will come hyder / wherefore call ye them your
self / and than when Justice calls god / our lady / all the saints in
witness and ye good angel and found it is that it is so as the devil says
if ye have not enough of witnesses I call his own conscience. And I you pray
that ye co^iure him yt he say troth / and than Justice sees by the counseyle
of the sinner that it is so. And so is it truly I ne can excuse me. Than says
Justice unto the sinner sith that it is so ye god / our lady / the saints /
and thy good au^gel with thyn own conscience have of accord that thou haste
done mortal sin / and that in this sin thou art deed with out repentance
thou sholdest be dampened perdurably for the witness that the devil brings
forth by suffycyent / and it behooves that I cast sentence of dampnacyon upon
the pardurably / for god says by ye prophet. Ai^aque peccauerit ip^a moriet^.
That is to say / that ye soul the which has sinned shall dye and shall be
dampened. So I ne know what counseyle to give but only to appel unto the
court of mercy / and put the and al thy causes in her hand. Than the sinner
should appel unto ye court of mercy the which is in this prensent life / and
he should go hastly to confess him. And first he ought to call the grace of
god / for the enemy shall pursewe him and theder shall send.iiii. advocates
and shall make party for to let this confession. And every man ought to
understand in this wise to confess him and in ye court of mercy. The first
advocate that the devil sends against the sinner that is cursed anger or
displeasure to tell his sin / and shall say in this wise unto ye sinner. Tell
thou not thy sin it should be great shame unto the / if men know that you
haste done such vylayn outrage and abhomynable / unto the which advocate ye
sinner should answer I shall tell it and dyscouer purely and makyngly and
largely without any thing hydynge for it is written who so covers his sin
god shall dyscouer him at ye day of Judgment before ye enemies / before the
vycgyn mary and aungelles / and saints / and before all the world. And wha^
this advocate shall be in such wise vay^quysshed than shall come the other ye
which has to name ypocrysye and shall say thus / tell it not unto thy
confessor for he weneth that thou be a good man / and if thou tell it him he
shall take his heart from ye / and he shall never set greatly by the. Believe not
such an advocate / for it is false / for know you that all good confessors
love better ye sinner or the sinners after the confession than before / and for
as much as he confesses him of the more great sins and abhomynables of as
much loves him the better / as ye have hyrde here above ye co^fessours be of
the nature of aungelles / for as much as the aungelles seen a more great sinner
converted of as much make they the more great Joy in henen / as our lord
says by the euangelystes and also the confessors. Example by ye gospel the
which speaks of one the which had an ho^dred sheep whereof he had lost one he
left the.iiij. score and.xix. and yode to seek that which was lost / and when
he had found him he took him between his arms and bare him in to his house
saying unto his friends and neighbors make Joy with me / for I had lost my
sheep and now have I found hy^. Inlyke wise it is of god when he fyndeth
again the sinner by true confession he makes more great Joy and feast than
he did of ye.iiij. score Just. If you will be than happy and well loved of thy
confessor confess the hardely and dyscouer thy sin plainly / purely / and
clenly. And he shall comfort the and aid the / and shall show more great good
of the than before. And when you haste vaynquysshed this advocate ye devil
theder sended the thyr de that is hope or trust of long life ye which shall
say My friend thou art yet young / thou shalt confess the tymely enough.
Unto whom thou sholdest answer I shall confess me shortly / for I have no
su^rte of the morrow. And when he shall be in such wise vay^quysshed Than shall
come the fourth advocate yt is cursed dread to do great penance / and shall
say in such wise / tell not thy syane for that / that it is to much great /
if thou tell it he shall give the so great penance that thou he may do it /
so sholdest thou be worse than you were before / unto whom you shalt answer.
Solomon say the who so dredeth to do a little penance and to suffer he shall
have so much to do ye there is no tongue the which can tell it for it
behooves that the sins be punisshed or else where. Than tell all thy sins
/ for if you hyde any sins by the counseyle of such an advocate thou lesest
thy cause in ye court of mercy / and if you tell all you art quyte / and to se
the so quyte that god ne our lady ne ye saints which ben in paradyse / ne the
devil that is in hell ne yet none other thing shall never have in my^de ne
have remembrance of thy misdeeds / so says god by the pyhete ysaye. No^
recordabo amplius iniq^tatis sue. Than shall yt sinner be well happy ye which
dare tell his sin unto a man mortal the which is a sinner as he is when in
ye other world before all the court of paradyse it shall be unto him in
reproach ill aduysed shall he be ye which loves better to be in horrible
penance and torment in all times perpetually tha^ to be there one year or two.
or.v. or.viii. or x. or.xx. if thou had wounds mortelles and thou ne
sheweste but.xj. to the surgyon / the.xj. should be heled and the.xij. should
be roten / and should make therein the end to dye. In likewise shall do ye syn^e
that you leuest to tell and shall rote thy soul hydynge the thou shalt dye
spyrtually by that point. Now have ye hetde whefore men say I confess me unto
god / unto the blessed byrgyn marye / and unto all the saints of paradyse /
and unto you sir. Now shall ye understand that this Journey has three miles as
the other has. The first is yt the confession ought to be entyer as it is
said without any thing hydynge. The second yt it ought to be made of good
will without constraynte as David says. Voluntary sacrificabo tibi et
co^fitebor. The third is yt the sinner have a very faith and a trust that god
him may pardon / for as saint Austyn says. God is more ready to pardon us than
we ben to demanded him pardon And in the end of his mile the sinner may rest
him and take hostell and not in the other two. That is to say to rest in
esparau^ce to have pardon and not to do as did Judas ye which said I have
sinned in betrayenge ye holy blood Innocent and Just. He confessed him
voluntayrly and entyerly his mysdede and made satysfacyon for he yielded again
the.xxx. pens. But he yode not by this later mile for he dispeired him. And so
did Cayn which said My sin is more greter than ye mercy of god. But he
should have said. My sin is much great / but yet is the mercy of god more
greter / and tho he cried to god for mercy and he abode the great mercy of god
and he had mercy and so had Judas. Now have ye hyrde the secoude Journey / now
here ye the third***

THe third Journey to walk in to paradise is satysfaccyon without ye which
Journey a man may not come thither. This Journey has three miles as ye other
has. The first is to restore ye theft yt a man has done / for saint Austyn
said yt the syn^e is not pardoned till that the theft be restored. No^
dimitter^ petm^ nisi restituatur ablatu^. Who so than takes from an other hy^
behooves to yield it / and also who so takes from god any good soul and
withdraws it by sin or by his ill example it behooves him to yield it and
to restore it.

Or who so takes from any his renome / and areyseth ill grace it behooves to
restore him unto his good renome Now may some say. I am yo^ge and I am led
by coyntyse wantonness as much as I may / and I have shende my self in the
church and in many other stedes and places before men / and women so much
that many has sinned by my folysshe countenance / werof I have be culpable by
many an ill example or by my draught how may I with draw them from sin / for
I ne know them all And also if I should return toward them parauenture
they should be enflambed in such manner yt I should return unto sin or that
themself there might fall again more strongely. And therefore me seems that
it should be great peril to return toward them / and what shall I there
do than / ye should take from sin those or them yt ye have made to sin /
that is ye most sure and best / but if ye may not put you in pain to with
draw other / and to yield them unto god for to put them in the place of those
that thou have taken from him / so shalt you appease him. For if ye have taken
from a man five shyllynges / it is not of necessyte that I yield unto him
again ye self five shyllynges if I ne may find it / but it behooves yt ye
yield unto him other five shyllynges. And for as much as thou know not how
many people thou haste drawn unto sin / therefore thou sholdest put the in
pain by good examples and by good doctrynes to retracte and withdraw as many
people as thou have made to sin / if thou ne may mo convert unto god and
else if thou ne may convert the people by words or examples at the leest
pray for them often in goodness. Example if a king made a noble dinner and made
to cry over all that who so should have and bring the gretest company should
be best welcome and also should have ye most fairest gift / every man should
pay him to come to dinner and to bring the most of people of his company yt
he might for to have of ye king ye most fairest gift. And in like wise is it
of god for our lord has made a cry over all the world by his messengers that
be the apostles / the prophets / and the doctors / and by the predycacyons
that he ye which shall bring the ye most fairest company unto dinner that is
to know most souls unto paradyse by his examples and doctrine he shall be
most best beloved and unto whom god shall do most great honor. And also in
so doing you shalt do honor unto god if thou pain the so to do and pray
often god in saying. Sir / or lord will thou by thy grace enlumyn my heart
and mine vndersta^dy^ge yt I may have every day remembrance of thy passion and
give me knowledge in what manner I may live for to draw most souls unto the.
And also that I may live unto thy praysy^ge by ye which it may be unto the
salvation of my soul and of many other. Also who so has wretched an other it
behooves to appease him / and to cry him mercy and to ask pardon / and also
thou sholdest restore the good renome and good fame unto him to whom thou have
done ill by thy cursed speech. And if it were so that any had taken any goods
temporal by any cursednes the which worldly goods and temporal ye world
gives better and by more stronger reason the good spyrytuall ye god gives
they should well better by restored And you may demand how a man may that
restore. Where that a man ne may one word brought forth draw back but that
it abydethe spoke. I grant me unto that / but you ne shalt never be quite
till unto that / that with all thy puyssaunce in all manners that thou cannest
and may thou him haste restored / and that thou have said unto all those and
unto all them the which by the cause has sinned or shall sin in yt thing
say yt thou have lied / and that thou have made them so to believe. And for
those thou ne know ye which it may believe thou art holden in the chyrches
to pronounce it in saying that the words that thou have said upon such a
person be not true / and that thou ne know never ne yet saw but good in
him and that cursedly thou haste pronounced it against him / and that it ne was
but for to blame him and so shalt thou have the first lege or mile. The
second mile is to weep and to complain his sins / or to do almysdede or
penance / or other good deeds for to have pardon and soueraynly for the love
of god. And that ought to be done by ye counseyle of his good confessor. And
the third mile is to pardon unto those the which has ill said unto you or
mysoone. Now may some say how may I pardon him ye which has done me damage
and without cause and reason. And yet also they have mocked me before the
streets / and yet I ne did never dyspleasure unto them. Example if there were
aman that ought unto the king a thousand pound / and the king held him in
prison and said unto him / if you pay me not thou shall be hanged / and he had
not whereof to pay. And if ye king would say unto him such a man there is
that owes the.v. shelynges / and I shall give to the that thou oweste me and I
shall let ye go quyte and thou shalt be my right well-beloved / and if thou do
it not thou shalt pay me yt thou oweste me / or I shall make the to be hanged
without remedy / sholdest anon do it I believe that yes. And if he did it not men
would say yt he were a fool. In like wise is hit spyritually to speak / we
ben greatly indetted against the great king that is unto god And it behooves
that we paye^ unto him that that we owe him / or we shall be hanged on ye gybet
of hell / but if the king will do unto us grace saying pardon all that yt men
has mysdone unto you / certes we thereto should well accord for we have a
hundred thousand times more mysdone unto god than man has done unto us. And
therefore should we with right good will pardon and so have ye herd ye three
Iourneys the which it behooves to have to enter in to paradyse wha^ ye sinner
has so much done by the grace of god yt is that he be in the estate of grace
than should he keep him above all things to fall again and to the end yt he
may the better keep him he should take in him a manner of lyuy^ge how he will
live / and also to absteyne him from sin / in like wise as he may well know
that when he does sin yt it displeases god. And so he pleases ye devil ye
which is a great folly. And first thou shalt pray for the church and for
all the prelates of the church and for all princes of the earth / and for all
the people ye which is committee unto him. Afterward you shalt pray for all
those unto whom thou art holden. And after for all creatures the which ben in
trybulacyon soueraynly for those that been departed and deed unto whom we ben
holden / and thou sholdeste think on the euylles of thy self. And on the
glory that thou would have / and on the pains that thou have deserved. And
after on the hour of death and on the hour of Judgment. And go often unto the
church and with good will / as soon as thou art in ye church behold ye
image of Jesus christ where he is crucyfied / and after take holy water / and
knele on thy knees and begin to say. Veni creator spiritus me^tes tuoru^ / or
Pater noster / and after take thy sete in the church the most pryuy place
that thou may. And after thou shalt say pryme / hours / and the letany / in
saying yt for get not the passion of thy creatoure in saying thy hours /
and at every mass that thou herest say thy confiteor softely and all the
times that it shall be feast commanded thou shalt be at the hye mass and at
the euensonge and you sholdest command the unto the saint of whom the feast
shall be / and the remenaunt of ye feast employed in good works spyrytuall.
And you will confess the confess the unto a confessor the which has
science and that he be a man of good conscience / for if he has thought on his
own soul he shall have thought of thyn / and if he be such as I tell ye obey
unto him in all goodness as unto the vycare of god be thou not idle at no time
ne yet arrest ye before thy door in ye street ne yet in thy window / be thou
more often alone than in company. And as unto fasting made by good dyscrecyon
you shalt know yt it is much good and that without discrecyon it is nothing
worth unto him the which fasteth / ne yet almesdede without dyscrecyon is no
thing worth. And in like wise as a lamp without oil ne may have light / even
so is fasting and almesdede without dyscrecyon / and thou sholdest know that
the substance that you drawest in to thy body thou ought to give it for the
love of god unto ye poor / and with that it behooves to eschew fro sin / or
that should be the fast of the devil the which always fasteth and evermore
does ill thou ne shalt ete but two times on the day if thou be not seek /
and ete thou never till that thou have said benedicite before / and after
graces / and speak but little at thy dinner if it be not of god if thou speak
there idle words than repent the. And speak you never words of an other that
thou would not that a man should speak of the. Thou sholdest speak at thy
dinner or think of some good thing to the end that thy soul may feed as well as
thy body / and when you have said graces thou shalt goo into thy chamber and
there you shalt say noon. And afterward you shalt study some good matter or
example / speak as little as you may in any place where so you be for a man ne
may little speak without sin. Go in to the town as little as thou may. And
when thou haste there to do / and if men areson the speak in brefe and humbly
and return in to thy house as soon as thou may / ete but litel out of thy
house be thou pyteous upon ye poor people if thou will that god take the in
good gree and that he have pity on ye give often for the love of god after thy
power yt thou haste. If you have any thing to do which touches the do it by
the counseyle of a good person. And also think that y^ ne may nothing hyd
from god ne keep / but that he sees all yt thou shalt do and say. Ordeyne so
well thy conscience that wha^ thou shalt be seek that you ne have no cause but
for to think on thy creator. And toward ye euentyde thou shalt say
euensonge and vygylles of ye deed if thou can them and pass not the day but
that thou think one time of the day on thy conscience in recordynge thy
sins for to hold the in humylite and thou shalt knele and salewe the holy
trynyte / and thou shalt say at ye leest three times the pater noster / and
after salve ye vyrgyn Marye and reco^maunde the unto god and unto ye virgyn
Marye and make some good prayer unto thy good angel that he be thoughtfull to
keep ye / and after bless the and take holy water and lay the down and sleep
in some good thought Be thou often in orayson be it of mouth or of heart say
things brennynge to have devotion. Three things there ben the which ayedethe
to have devotion. The first is puryte of conscience / in likewise yt when any
would pray a great lord he should take heed yt when he comes before him ye
nothing appear unto him that shall dysplease ye lord. And so is it who so will
go in orayson he ought to eschew yt he ne have any spotte of syn^e in him ye
which should dysplease unto god the which sees the hertes of all the other.
Than saint Bernarde says yt all the times that we go in orayson we enter in to
the court of heaven in the which ye king of glory is. Also aourned with mayny
au^gelles of princes celestyalles and of the gloryus queen of heaven. So we
should appear in great reverence and in great fere and in great humilyte and in
great puryte and in great cle^nes of heart / to the end that nothing appear in
us that should dysplease unto so great a lord as unto god / for saint Johan
says that when thou makeste orayson make that you be such as you ought to be ye
which has to speak with god / purge than thy consyence of all things unto thy
power and meke ye / and afterward make unto god request or else you shall not
be exalted. The second is yt he ought to seek a place secret yt he ne be
seen to the end yt he ne be troubled. And that the wind of vain glory ne take
from him ye fruit of his orayson. Example we have in Jesus chyrst ye which
enlonged him and went far from his dyscyples wha^ he would pray in the
gardyn of olyuete / and moses the which assended in to the mountain. And
also ye angel found Marye alone when he saluted her / and saint Frau^cys had
of custom yt when he would pray god he yode serre of in to a wood that his
fellows ne might here hy^ And of that have we an example of our self / if a
man has to speak with an other he speaks unto him more gladly when he fyndeth
himself all alone. The third thing is yt he should at yt hour cast out of
his heart all dremes and thoughts and afterward to be all in orayson.
The.iiij. thing yt he ought to have with all his heart great entende to pray
ye holy ghost that he give unto him grace of devotion / for orayson without
devotion has no savor / put than pain to houe it do that / that in ye is and
god shall end it. And if god give the grace for to worsshyp him menynge the
pain that you there shall take weep / for teeres ben as right good wine of ye
which ye soul devout wexeth drunk unto god in orayson in such manner yt he
ne can refuse him in that thing yt he demau^deth / in likewise as it appears
by saint Peter / and by magdaleyn ye which wept and god gave unto them that yt
they demanded that was pardon of their sins. Teres ben of right great
profit and of right great virtue / for one only tere may get of god that
that all the au^gelles in heaven ne all ye saints of paradyse ne may do that is
to know when ye sinner wepeth for his propre sins whereof it is written in the
psalter that ye most pleasant sacyfyce that ye sinner may make unto god is
that he be contryte and repentau^te and that he humble him before god in
weeping / for when ye tere of the sinner repentaunt is offered unto god with
humble heart and devout it thrughe perceth ye heaven by her virtue and mou^teth
till unto the throne of the mageste dyuyne / and there ne is angel the which
it may ne dare hold till unto that that it be come before the face of god /
and that it has gotten that that he will for his souls health / for the orayson
the which is made in weeping as says saint Austyn thrughe perseth the heart
of our lord Jesus christ and moves him unto pyty and entreats and enclyneth
to love him and changes ye sentence of Judge and records the sinner
perfytely unto god. The.vj. is that he ought to regard the estate of this
present mysery where there is so many perelles that there is none ye which
may it account / for man is evermore in temptacyon of ye flesh of worldly
vanitees / and of the begylynge of of thyn enemy / other in stepinge or in
waking / or in speaking But he should think yt the world and the flesh ne
vayn quysshe but their friends / and therefore should he well keep him that he ne
be friend of the world ne of the flesh / for all those yt love the world
and the flesh ben the enemies of god as says saint James. Marvel it is how
the world may be Joyous who so well regards ye peril of this world / for
the world is a Iayle wherein we ben in prison for our sins / and we ne know
when we shall goo out of it wheder we shall be saved or dampened Now should it
be agrete nouelte if the these should sing or laughe when men led him to be
hanged / but yet ben we well more out of wycte and more abused than such
thieves for we run all unto the gybet of hell and unto dampnacyon perdurable
all daunsynge and making feast / for we ben in like wise as a vessel in the
hye see with all the sail stretched and hysed with wind at will and we go every
day on great Iourneys to ward hell or paradyse / for we ne know yet in what
part we shall aryue and so all in slepynge / in walking / in drinking / in
etynge in playenge / and in singynge evermore we goo for ward without arestynge
as people the which ben of the sea. And therefore who so well beholds this
world and the great peril he should have better cause to weep than to laughe
/ for if the sinner behold the heaven he sees the country and heritage
eternal where as is perfyte felycyte from ye which he is yet far of by his
sins. And for as much he has good cause to weep. And if he behold the
earth he sees ye matter whereof he has be made and where unto he shall
return at the hour when he shall depart from this world / that is in
the end of this life. And if he look under ye earth he sees hell ye which is
ready to engloute him with mouth open / and to tour meant for his sins. And if
he look on the right hand he sees the prosperitees and the rychesses whereof
all the world it is abused and deceived and drawn unto dampna eyon. And if he
look on the lift hand he sees the ylles and trybulacyons that ye cursed done
unto the good. And if he look behind him he sees the time yt he has lost in
vanytees and in thoughts that he should have dispended in good works. And if
he look before him he sees the death which comes / and yet ne knows wha^ he
shall dye / ne of what death / ne in what place / ne i^ what estate. And if he
look within him he sees his conscience full of sins / and his wit and his
body full of cursed manners / and enclyned in cursed customs. And if he look
without him he fyndeth himself enuyroned and beset about with so many perils
/ and ne knows how he shall escape. And also he sees and knows the dure
and hard sentence of the ryghtfull Judge yt he shall also cast at ye day of
Judgment upon ye sinners of ye which he is one of ye nombre if he amend not
his conscience. We should put our end in teres and in penance / and we should
call ye holy ghost in oraysons that he be unto us in aid and that he defend us
from all our sins and from all our myseryes. The.vij. thing is to regard
the estate wherein he shall be at the death when all our members have lost all
their force and strength / and the soul going forth from the body shall se
our lord out of measure wroth with him for his sins / if he ne be than
truly penytent and repentau^t of all his defautes / and under he shall se hell
open for to engloute him / and his sy^nes he shall se on his right hand yt
which shall accuse him and the enemies on the left hand yt which would bear
hy^ away and horrible shall cry upon him. Thy^ke than often on these things
and without end and I know well if thou understood them that you sholdest
despise lightly all ye vanytees of the world and shall draw yt unto devotion
/ for the vanytees wordely shall more grieve at the death than ne do aid and
than there no ne may aid ne socour / ne friends / ne parents / ne fader / ne
mother / ne almesdede / ne penance / ne prayer of saint holy man or holy woman
/ ne good deed what so ever he be / ne other thing if he be taken in sin
morcall / than every man ought well to pray god yt he will give him grace to
leave well and to do well to put thereto pain for good life ledeth to good
end. And saint Austyn saych / who so has well lived ne shall not dye ill.
The.viij. thing is yt he ought to regard and to record the great humylyte
and pacyence and the passion of Jesus chyrst yt he had in earth for to give us
example / for all be it yt he were lord of heaven and of ye earth / yet would
he be borne for us of a woman and would be poor and deiecte and to sustain so
many persecucyons and pain that a man ne can nombre it / and after yt hour
that he was borne till unto ye hour that he dyed on the cross he ne would have
no richesse / ne none honor / ne any delight / but ever more had pain travail
and pouerte. And i^ yt he gives unto us counsel that he which will go unto
god should more love in this world tribulacyon than delight -- for delytes
nourysshen the vices and led the soul in to hell And therefore a man should
desire for to be hated of the world / for our lord says / ye shall be well
happy when the world shall hate you and curse you and shall repute you for
nothing. And when ye day of Judgment shall come he shall say unto those ye
which in such wise has be mocked in the world / ye be those the which were
with me in the world in these temptacyons and therefore come ye with me / for
your reward is great in heaven. Pray we than god that he give us and send us
tribulacy on in this world and give puyssau^ce to bear it. The.ix. is that he
ought to regard how Jesus christ dyed for us shame fully and with great
confession / and how he was for us be ten / spytte on / bound / mocked / and
crowned with thorns the which entered in him unto the brain. And so in all
his passion to record that he unto us showed more greter pacyence / ne more
greter love / ne might no man show unto his friend than to will dye for him /
whereof saint Bernarde says. If my heart were a see of teres and mine eyne
fountaynes and all my here is stremes and all ran without ceasynge as a river /
ne never ceased ne failed / yet ne might I suffycyently weep ye passion of our
lord Jesus christ that he suffered for me. The ten thing is that he ougte to
fasten his heart and ye eyes of his understanding to behold ye Joys yt god
has apparayled unto those the which love him and he ought to have in
co^templacyon the blessed and glorious virgyn Marye queen of all the world
enuyroned and set about with aungelles / and with archau^gelles with her noble
covent of virgyns all clothed and anourned so rychely and so nobly that heart
ne may think party of the leest beauty of her vyrgyns. And there ben the
prophets / ye apostles / the martyrs / and the confessors the which shall be
all as kings and princes and gretelordes and after the other saints without
nombre. O how that they shall be rychely beseen. And that it shall be great
gladness and Joy to se the king and his company. But what shall it be to se
after ward ye king his mayntayn and his estate whose beauty is so great ye
all the enhabytauntes of heaven ne may never enough marvel ne them fulfill to
behold hy^. Saint Bernarde says that the beauty of ye kings and the beauty
of the noble heaven is so great that if a man were assured to live in this
world here a thousand years evermore young Joyous in great honor and in great
richesse and with that that he were assured to have all ye delytes yt he can
thy^ke / yet should he put all those things as naught for to se without more
one only hour of the leest Joy or beauty that is in beuen. There is ye arber
of delyces / there ben ye songs melodyous / there be^ the lovers varytable
there ben the dysportes pleasant There is all that heart may remember for
person to rejoice. There is glory perpetual without honger and without
amenyssheme^t. Make we us ready than hastily for to go thither. Right dear
brethren and systers above all things / regard well yourselfe / regard what
ye lately have be / and what ye shall be after your death from whens ye come and
wheder ye go and where ye be. Think you what it is of a man or a woman after
the death / for it is but a caryon stynkynge and foul and mete unto worms.
Think often that ye ne be but a poor worm all naked going forth of the earth
and that unto earth it be houeth you to return. Remember you from day to
day / or from one hour unto an other in peril to desce^ de and to fall into
hell for our sins ye go unto the death and unto Judgment as at an hour.
Remember yt ye have be sent in to the world and think and remember you
wherefore and what ye there should do and where ye shall go to lodge the first
night after that we shall be departed from this world / for ye shall go into
paradyse in to purgatory / or in to hell. And if ye goo in to paradyse ye shall
be ashamed yfye be not as well anourned with virtues as those that ye shall
there find. And yfye go in to purgatory charged with sins ye shall suffer
there pain right horrible. And yfye go in to hell ye shall have there shame
and pain perpetual horrible and meruayllous more than man ne may speak. Be ye
than aduyled and certain that ye shall dye / and more sooner than is ne think
or wene. The days of man be short and also pass suddenly as the shadow. Be
ye certain that all that ye found in the world it behooves you to leave
rychesses / honors / delytes we ne shall bear no thing from hens / but our
good deeds and our ill. And in like wise as those the which leave now ben so
has those lived the which ben deed. And in like wise as those the which ben
deed were wont to live / so shall those dye ye which now live. Look well upon
this thing and have yourselfe in a wayete / for ye ne know the hour of ye
death. Learn to be humble and debonayre. And bear all tribulacyons and
aduersytees swetely and in patience for the love of god the which so much
has borne for you. And eschew ye world as much as ye may in all things
worldely / serve ye those the which serve god / and have ye none affyau^ce in
those the which take gladly of an other and the which receive with good will
gifts for gifts blind the wise wen / but have affyaunce in hy^ in whom is
loyalte for in all manner seek your health Be he with good will in the company of
those the which love god so ye shall part with your good deeds / but keep you
from the having of to much great familyaryte with man or woman all be it that
he be good or that it seems unto you that he be good / for many in such wise
has been deceived do ye well unto the poor specially unto those the which
love god / learn the co^mau^ dementes of god and break them not for no thing
that may be. Be you ever a true sayer and verytable and lie thou not for no
thing that may come thereof / yfye have to suffer for to speak veryte your
reward shall be more great in heaven. And you shalt give unto all people good
example. Here every day mass yfye may / be ye often in orayson / and more of
heart than of mouth / brefe oraysons perseth ye heaven / so that it be said with
good heart ne pray thou thing the which is not necessary unto body or unto
soul. Draw all persons unto good by good doctrine / think often on ye
passion of Jesus christ and desire to suffer for the love of him / in like wise
as he has suffered for us / flee the temptacyons that ye ne may goodly
vaynquysshe or overcome. Be you sobre in dry^kynge and in etynge that is the
health of the body and the welfare of the soul / seek evermore the peace of god
/ if al ye world should be worth / for a man ne may please god and the world
together / and if ye fall out of good purpose goo hastly unto confession / what
thing that ye se or here turn all unto the best / and if your entencyon come
to effect think that god does it to assaye you / or the enemy for to tempte
you and for to deceive you / if you hold you well ye shall do unto god pleasure
and if ye fall yet arise again by co^fessyon as soon as ye may in humblynge
you / and purposynge to amend you au other time / if the temptacyou come
again unto you and that ye have the vyctory love ye and praise ye god / and
bear ye amyable that the ill that men has done unto you or spoken. Repreue
all ylnes that men speak unto you or do by good manner without wrathynge you. Be
ye contrary unto those the which ben contrary unto god and unto reason / and
unto all good veryte / love you that god loves / and flee that thing that god
hates / have ye peace with all persons / and syke in all things ye love of
god / purchase virtues in doing good works to the end that ye may come unto ye
glory perdurable*

AMEN.
