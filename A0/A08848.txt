To the right worshipful, Maistresse Isabel Harington, one of the Gentlewomen
of the Queens Majesty's most honorable privy Chamber, Thomas Paulfreyman her
daily Orator wishes (with continuance) the increase of Gods eternal grace and
favor.
AS EXPERIENCE plainly teaches, time truly tells, and nature for the most
part approves the diversity of our humane affects in diet: how not only to
the worshipful or most honorable, but also to the very poorest and of most
base estate, the delicatest, most deintie, svvete and pleasant dishes, are not
alvvayes aptely agreeable, or to content fully their minds, but sometimes for a
shift and to their better liking, desires more ordinary, gross and familiar
fare: vvherby in nature they are the better contented, their appetites often
times more quickened, their minds recreated, yea, and the healthes of their
bodies the better also preserved: even so (right worshipful) touching the
interne part, divine substance or inward affections of the soul: the
heavenly nature also and most christen diet thereof, experience and time bears
likevvyse their sway, effectually to judge and declare the same in truth,
among the sound members of Christ's only immaculate, most preciouse and
unspotted body, to their sufficient contentation, quickening, recreating, and
most healthful preserving. And albeit you are herein for your part, as the
elect of God surely grounded in him of good purpose foreappoynted, and by
grace most happily called, to be in this life (with prepared soul and quiet
conscience) partaker of sundry his heavenly delicates, accustomably norished,
most dayntely sedde, and abundauntly satisfied, to your very well lyking, in
the excellency of such your ioyouse and inward refection: and without over
secret hiding, a known distributor of your good portion to others, for their
both bodily and ghostly comfort at all times in necessity, as the shevver
favorably forth the flowing fruits of faythfulnesse and true piety: yet
presuming upon your virtue and christen clemency, I have now boldly
attempted and most humbly commended unto you (for varieties sake) this most
unworthy, very slender, and over base present, to be at the least by your
godly sufferaunce (as superfluous store among the rest) but a backestander in
your sight, to be looked upon aloof, a long and far off, as it were but by
the way, even with a glauncing eye, and at leisure to be tried for your only
pleasure, what is the effectual and true taast thereof. But not to alienate or
alter by any means, your already well stayed and most happy affections, so
mightily confirmed in you (and that in the best part) by the ineffable power
of Gods most sacred spirit, your only and omnisufficient pillar: but rather
in deed to incitate you (if possibly it might be) to the better estimation of
your own former provision, and most faultlesse fornamed furniture. And truly
great reason why it should be so, that things well known, and of most
excellency, should have condignely their best preferment: for so God him
self with the most godly, would vvishe by justice it should so be, how
soever most commonly they are known to the contrary. And notvvithstanding
the days are now diversely dangerous, very dayntie, and exceed in much
fynenesse, whether in speaking, curiouse devising, exact searching or penning
of matter, touching either divinity or otherwise of Profane descriptions: so
very singular, exquisite, pycked, and tender are men's ears, naturally adjoined
to their flourishing, quick, and ready vvyttes, profounde knowledge and
judgment: and therefore the more hasardefull, and a mean truly to purchase
unto themselves that deal in such cases, rather reprochefull and many
scornful scoffs, than commendation or show of good countenance, unless
they rarely exceed or surmount the well doings of infinite others: and that
also (touching this my present attempt (vvheras the godly in these days, has
most graciously endeavored to set forth already, and that most plentifully,
diverse and sundry works, very divinely, of great excellency, and of
necessity, to quicken and stir up daily to God, the over drousie, slack,
and sick sinful souls, to rejoice also their minds, and to fructify
before him, their unprofitable and baraine hearts: yet as a pore helper, a most
inferior labourer, or well vvilling drudge in the vineyarde of Christ,
humbling my self most gladly, under the correction of the charitable and
friendly, of the godly wise in their known virtue and humbleness, approved
skilfulnesse, vvatchfulnesse, and needy diligence, in that their holy function
appointed: beholding with them the necessity of the time, how the vvilde
vveedes of vvilfulnesse to wickedness, sin and abomination, do daily
abound and reign rankly without sufficient stop, in their very infectuous
and filthy fullness, to choke, to repress and keep low by the ground, the
fragraunte and svveete smelling fruits of virtue: whereby, as with infinite
snares, the Devil entangleth, still daily increases, infecteth, poisoneth,
and hazardeth all the leudly idle, careless and vain children of this so sore
crazed and old stouping world of death (alredie judged, condemned, and at the
brink of death:) in whom, by whom, and during whose time, Satan tempts,
allureth, deceives, plucketh toward him, and tosseth them as it seems
with his cruel clavves, up side down at his pleasure, and dalieth with
them at his will, as with his own possessed, as with those that forsake
God, as in a time of the contempt of god, of hating the clear light of god, of
loving the darkness of the devil to their condempnation more than the light,
of self love, of pride and vanity, of defiled life, and such like: a time
approved of all times, most strange, most monstrous, and therefore the more
dangerous: vvherby satan with his whole rablement of hellike ministers, the
world also it self, and the proud rebellious flesh, mainly bestirreth the^
with their full power together, to make hauock, and to bring altogether under
their servile, most confused and bitter yoke: I have in my most simple
understanding, and as God therein by his grace has directed me, endeavored to
bestow some part of my time, in setting forth sundry godly meditations and
prayers, upon special causes respected, as instruments, to shrub, to root
out, cut down, spoil and destroy, at the least some poisoned evils, from
the most beautiful and lovely vineyard of Christ. And as I have by them
thought most convenient, that our almighty and most terrible God (who
seems to be greatly amongst us forgotten) in every of them should cheefely be
had in remembrance, to be duly reuere^ced and feared, to be called upon and
most highly magnified: so have I for the most part, made mention of our
frailetie, present and most vvretched state, and of the mighty power also of
our forsaid enemies, how politic they are, how puissant, how vvatchful,
how cruel, how accustomably in all estates they do prevail, and that God
therefore by humble suit would sone grant us his mercy, exte^d forth his arm
to strengthen us, and most grationsly in time deliver us: least in the
vvaightinesse of our sins yet daily amongste us increased, we be over sore
pressed, our consciences most fovvly defiled, burdened, depely galled and
vvounded, the judgments of the highest not vvayed, our inward senses
benumbed, our hearts hardened, all divine graces contemned, and so with the
plages of God, the more svviftly by his justice confounded: heaping in the
while vengeance upon our selves, against the day of his wrath and public
declaration, of his proclaimed and just judgment, and to be dampened with the
world, with the Devil, and his Angels for ever: unto whom, by whose
custom, and importune knocking at the doors of our graceless, very vain,
and most frutelesse hearts (the knocking of the Lord Christ vvilfully
neglected) we have subjected our selves, and opened vvide unto him, to let
in both him self, his conjoined companions, and with them all abomination and
vnrightuouseneste, to quicken with more have the flames of Gods fury, to make
ponderous and over heavy, the svvitfe descending balance, of his very
terrible and irrcuokeable justice. To the end therefore, this small and most
simple volume, may (under your godly protection) gather the rather some
estimation and credit, and pass forth for good to the use of the godly, I
most humbly beseech your worship, so to accept it in the simplicity
thereof, and grant thereunto your Christian furtherance, that some good for
Gods glory, may grovve thereby to some, that some lives at the least may be
somevvhat amended, the furies of God the sooner prevented, and the bright
light of the son of god shine with more power amongste us, to overthrow
us in his fear, to beat flat to the earth, our carthie and proud flesh,
and to waste soon or consume, for good and most happy change, our most
damnable works of darkness. I shall (as of bounden duty, for this and for
other the like causes deserved) most humbly pray for you, that God in mercy
may ever bless, both you, your most worthy beloved in Christ, your
offspring, and whole family.

Your humble and daily Oratoure, THOMAS Paulfreyman.

An exhortation to the christen Reader.
BEing mindful (de uout christian) of god thine heavenly father: and as best
beseems thee, an earthly creature, always to remember thy maker, and that by
a quickening spirit in the inward and new man, commended unto thee from
above, thorough the free grace of election in Jesus Christ: by whom thou art
newborn: to whom thou art coupled a quick and a lively member: with whom thou
art partaker of the Heavenly and divine nature: (even the nature of God thine
eternal father:) In whom thine heart is prepared toward him: by whom thou
seek most truly to know him: most earnestly to love him: Whereunto the
eternal spirit stirs the hearts of gods elect.
diligently to seek him: faithfully to serve him: most lowly to honor him:
reverently to fear and obey him: and so forth as his only word of truth most
straightly prescribes and precisely requires of thee, of all people, and in
all estates, thoroughout all generations. In his high magnificence,
almightynesse, etermtie, great power and majesty: to love him in his
benignity, in his myldenesse, tenderness, faithfulness, truth and great
mercy: to fear him in his lordly dignity, princely government, stateliness,
rough countenance, wrathefulnesse, severe justice and judgment: and to offer
daily unto him, the acceptable sacrifice of faithful and hearty prayers, in
the name of his son Jesus Christ, as he himself most healthfully taught
thee: and for whose only sake, promise is made to hear thee, that his mighty
hand may ener preserve thee, uphold thee, keep thee safe, norishe thee,
direct, strengthen, defend and deliver thee, in all places, at all times, and
in all cases of necessity, both of bodge and soul: and to give thee also
thorough Christ, his holy spirit, as a seal of assurance, to certify thee
that thou art the child of God, inwardly to inflame and comfort thee, to
warke true faith into thee, to dispose with cherefulnesse the fruits of true
charity, to quiet thee in all tempests of adversity: yea and to lead thee
still on by the hand (for the time, and from time to time) unto the place of
rest, the cheerful and safe port, the restfull haven or most sure rode of
eternalioy and felicity. If thou desire to enjoy all these and such like
blessings as are most needful for thee (both for body and soul) from the
hand of God, and according to the measure of the gift of Christ: O hearken then
unto the voice of the Lord thy God: Incline bubly thine ear: A preparation to
Prayer.
prepare thine heart: sike him early in holiness: turn thee unto him without
delay: receive him with most pure affection: and lift up sone thy sickely
soul, to behold the glory of his countenance. O bond thy body of earth,
down to the face of the earth. Groan in thy self to God with grief, and lay
open simply before him, the felt secrets of thy sinful heart. Call daily upon
him, and so advisedly try him, as thou have assured trust in him. And before
thou duetifully at temptest thy godly contemplatio^s, prayers, praises, and
thanks giving to God: prepare thee earnestly a sit soul, for the presence of
so high and great a God. Certain special cautes following, that are to be
co^sidied by gods children: whereof they examine the selves before prayer and
receyning of the holy sacramintes, to avoid his heavy judgments.
Forget not before whom thou presentest thy self, and unto whom thou doste
mind to talk. Be not vainly or wiekedly presumptuous, in thine high and great
attempt before him. Abase thy self: tremble in his presence. Remember, god
beholds al disorders in thee, with a piercing, sharp, and revenging eye.

1 Examine therefore thy self before with indgemente. Descend deeply into
thine own bowels, and see there, whether thou be (as of right thou ought)
truly penitent for thy former sins and wickedness.

2 Whether thou determinest (thence forth) from thine heart, not to turn
again unto them, as does a clean washed swine, which newly defiles her
self, in the loathsome and foul stinking mire.

3 Whether thou be in his sight a louble faced or deep dissembling
hipotrite, touching thy dealings with him and the world, as thy book in thee
of records most plainly witnesses unto thee.

4 Whether thou be (as by name thou professest) a zelouse fauorer of the word
of life.

5 Whether thou (with the Prophet David) vnseinedly hate all supersticiouse
vanities, contrary to the word of life.

6 Whether thou (with the said prophet) feel in thy self to be grieved
with the enemies of God, and with all such as rise up against him, or to
suppress the word of life.

7 Whether thou weyest with thy self, that like as thy body, being but of an
earthy and corporal substance, cannot possibly live without the usual
nourishmente of material bread and meat: so the soul, in the spiritual
state thereof, cannot live but be sterued and dye (even the eternal and
everlasting death) without the spiritual nutriment and heavenly sweet taste
of the word of God, which to the soul is the only bread of lyse, and
whereafter thou should hunger, too uphold thy life.

8 Whether thou steadfastly believe to be saved, by the only merits, death and
bloodshed of Christ crucified upon the cross, without thine own and other
men's merits, either their most damnable and idolatrous devised vanities.

9 Whether thou thynkest it not the Dyuels bewytchyng, by his malign mimsters,
to be deprived of so pious and precious a prepared ransom.

10 Whether thou at the receiving of the holy mysteries of Christ's body and
blood, understand them to be his own only ordinance, for the use of his
holy church, and to be witnesses therein of the open and public confession
of the true says which thou haste in him, and to be saved only by his
bodilye death and the bloody sacrifice upon the Cross, once for all offered
unto God his heavenly father, for thine, for mine, and for all the sins of the
whole world, even so many, as have this acceptable says of God in them.

11 Whether thou have regarded by the word of God (touching the Sacrament of
Christ's body and blood) the difference therein, betwixt the Diuelles faith and
thine, either the says of an Hipocritishe and dampnable reprobate.

12 Whether thou have by true says repugned the Devil, The diffrence to be
considered between the true christians faith, the faith of the devil, and the
reprobate
who boldly chale^geth thee (as he thinks he may be bold) and makes equal
compart son with thee of thy says, touching simply the confession of
Christ, as of his Conception by the holy Ghost: of his Nativity and birth of
the virgin Marie: to be also the Son of God lived perfect and undefiled man
upon the earth, his doings to be only omnipotent, most miraculous and
wonderful: suffered most sharp and cruel death: was buried: rose again,
ascended into the heavens, very God and very man: yea, and of his return
also again unto judgment. All these things, the Devils believe and confess
with thee: but yet utterly vnperswaded, to be his only sufficient savior and
redeemer, by his precious blood shed and death: even as those saithlesse
wickedness, which in their unsoundness, stubbornness, and vnstayednesse,
touching the covenant of God in his son Christ, for their salvation, account
the price of his precious blood to be insafficient for them, without the very
absurd and most fond annexing of their own and other men's merits: and so
to make Christ unto them selves, to be at the most, but a mingled, peeced,
botched, and patched Savior.

13 Whether thou have on this manner following considered of Satan's challenge and
comparison with thee, and said thus unto him in the secrecies of thy faithful
soul, The true christian at earnest defiance with the devil: and she weth unto
him for his disco^^geme^t the power of his faith.
for thy defense: O thou very mortal, most cruel and damned enemy, I
unfeignedly from mine heart defy thee: I withstand thee to the face: thou have
naught to do with me, or to make such comparisous with me in my christen and
most holy profession. I know full well thy malice and stoutnesse, which has been
in thee from the beginning, both against the anointed of God and all his.
Experience teaches me, of thy not slumbring, of thy wandering about, and
seeking watchefully to devour and to spoil me of my faith, whereby I must be
saved. I tell thee thou most wicked one, thy travel is all in vayn. I am none
of thine, nor nothing inclined to thine affection or motions. I am Gods I tell
thee, and the persuaded child of God by his spirit of truth, who by grace
possessing me, and by his power mightily working in me, has most graciously
planted in my heart, the fruitful tree of pictie, of true and perfect faith,
fast roted in me, deply stayed, and surely settled, even with the finger of god
my father, touching the dignity, price and true estimation of his son, and
mine only saviors most preciouse body, for mine only health and eternal
salvation. And though I have fallen or fainted, as traitorously thou have
tripped me, yet of frailty have J fallen, and not wilfully of malice, as thou
haste most maliciously tempted me: which God has seen in me, in mercy
therefore has raised me up again, and will still uphold me in spite of thee.
Art thou ignorant of this (thou griseled and foul helly monster) that I am not
such a one as thou art, or as thou would have me, to be doubtefull of my
faith, as the wicked are, to leave the freedom of Gods spirit, and to be
entangled again in thine infernal filthy bands? Think thou, that I being
now called to the light and knowledge of the sweet word of life, whereof I
have truly tasted, and have in detestation mine old conversation, will be
newly again deceived, offer to approach, either once nibble or smell to thy
beslubbered, brackishe, and most filthy embrued baytes? Notest thou me of such
slipperinesse, that having far entrance in the spirit, and feel the
incomparable joys thereof, that I will now end in the greefes and sorrows of
the flesh? to set so little by the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, that taking
hold of the Plough, will now look back again, to be as a Dog, and to
return again to my vomit, or as a beastely Swyne, to beraye my self again
in the mire, to defourme the Image of God, and to defile his holy Temple? No no
Satan thou art deceived, I tell thee truly for thy discouragemente, I am now
better schooled, well armed, and better warned, to let thee go for naught.
Know thou not that I have put upon me to endure for ever, my Lord and God,
my Christ and Savior? Art thou forgetful (O thou enemy) that I in true
faith professing his name, and receiving woorthily his bolye and most blessed
Sacraments, by the only rule of his word, am armed over all, with his only
healthful, and most merciful merits, to strengthen me mightily against thee:
who is made mine with all that he has: and I am only his, hoth body and
soul: one body with him: flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones. Ah
Satan, this certeinty and truth in faith considered, wastefull are thy
wretched wandringes and wylye waightings to wreck and vex my soul. Away from
me, away J say thou cursed and spightfull spirit: or stay if thou lust to
offer boldly unto me (as thou dare) thy very blashlesse and brag attempts
of malignitie. I yet tell thee, they shall not hurt me: neither do I any thing
esteem thee: J regard not thy force: J fear not thy fury: The Lord is my
God: he is the God of my strength and considence: thou have of thy self, no
power at all against me: For what so ever thou attempteste or seek to
perform, therein to thy will thou want power. But that which thou do, is
by his only omnipotent hand and sufferaunce that is my God: whose weight and
mightiness, thy broosed brains has selte, to make thee stonpe for ever, to
hamper thee at his will to thine own irons, to over throw thee soon in thine
own turn, and to blow thee backewarde at will, even with the breath of his
mouth, into the bailesse and deep botomelesse pit: whose bond slave thou
art and a drudge enforced: and in thine outrage by his permission, a known
peerless paricide, a very restless, pitilesse, and most graceless raunging
roge, the only ring leader and infectuouse rank root of all reproach, of all
mischieues and abomination under the son.

14 O beloved Christian: Whether art thou in this wise armed with says too
stand too the face of the Devil, sharply to reprove him, and put him to
flighte?

15 Whether have thou in thine heart through this says, heavenly mirth and
melody, inward reioicing, and thy return with triumph, exalted the name of
thy God, felt in thy self to be doubtless his child, and too love (as thou
lawfully ought) the law of thy dear and most loving father?

16 Whether have thou considered or not, this heavenly mystery aforesaid to be
the Sacrament of true piety, the Character of perfect vnttie, and the most
assured band of frutful and christian charity?

17. Whether thou, being a subject in any estate (borne to be ruled under thy
soueragne and not to rule) bear unto her thy dear and natural Prince as also
to thine native country (by the blood of Gods word) a natural, saithfull,
and true loving heart.

18 And finally, whether thou be christianly charitable, or a clear remitter
of all thy neighbors offenses as thou thy self would of God be clearly
remitted. And so forth in all other things, as best behooves thine holy
profession: least to the contrary (in gods sight) all thy conceived holiness
by orater or whatsoever, being but provbane, hipocritish, childish, mere
darkness and very folly, there be found in thee, but the only title, or
vnauailable bare name of christianity: and therefore very perniciouse,
burifull, and to be turned into sin against thee: and so in stead of
healthful, very delightful, and beautiful blessings (which thou daily
huntest after) the banefull, most bitter, and black curses of God, do
sodeinly fall upon thee. Beware then J exhort thee, look well to thy self:
in time: flatter not thy self vainly or rather dampnablie: be not long a
dalier, in the school house of daliaunce: be not always a fondling, a
weakling, or a suckling, a milkesoppe, or babish infant in Christ: weye truly
the virtue of healthefull, manfull, and strong nourishmente in Christ, attend
to the time: thou shouldeste now be a strong man in Christ: thou art now as
a man most grationsly visited, for the highest do seek thy company: than the
which, what should thou more desire. O remember then, how very reproachful,
how vnma^full, unhealthful, hurtful, miserable, and disco^mendable, is thy
servile state, in such wise to be pind in, not to grow out in time, nor get
from thy rockinges, thy wearisome wrappinges, or swaddling bands of extreme
weakness: but always to be lulde in the arms of untimely tenderness,
whereby thou art barred from thy highest and most chief solicitie. Way warely
by the scriptures, thy due danger and discomme^dation, of such thine
insensibilitie and wearishnesse. Should not thou rather rejoice, to be calde
as a man of strength to the fellowship, ripe age, and strong manhood of Christ,
and to be partaker in his presence, of his most frendefull, healthful,
strengthfull, and heavenly banquet? whereunto, al things are already prepared,
and thereunto art thou now called. God also grant thee, to be in the number of
his elect, that thou may with says set forwards thy foot, hungerly with
zeal to strive for thy place, and to believe by Gods only word, that the lord
of the seast favors thee. Be not hindered, hinder not thy self, let excuses
be far from thee, defer not the favoring of thy souls refreshing, look to
thy turn in time, open to day thine eyes, and be not yet blind to morrow,
least with the blind, in thy will of blindness, thou be sone blindely led,
into the irrecouerable, deep, and most damnable dungeon of blindness,
darkness and horror, with the devil, the Prince of darkness and death
forever. Consider this, he that sees thee (even as in deed thou art) is a God
of most clear sight, bright light, truth and righteousness. Call to mind
toward him, thy true profession and service: turn not th^^ but of true kind:
lean simply (...) truth: join not with the wicke^ which by their questions
dout of that truth, and ask how know you that it is the word of truth: for
both they and thou shall answer to that word of truth: whereby must be
directed, both thy religion and manners: and wherein, thou must be both
mindful, skilful and tha^keful for thy discharge. Jgnoraunce cannot excuse
thee, it shall not excuse thee: thou ought not be ignorant, thou nedest not
be ignorant: what so ever is written, is written for thy learning: thou read
it, thou hear it, or thou may if thou lust: It is not far from thee: It
is before thine eyes and in thine heart, if grace be with thee toward it, and
is most truly pronounced unto thee, by the eternal spirit of truth, and that
most miraculously with all simplicity, by his zealous ministers, inwardly to
pierce thee, to lighten the darkness of thine heart, and to quicken true life
unto thee, if thou haste ears to hear in these days, the days of gods
grace, and of his heavenly visitation. Vain curiosity of faults finding and
complaining, shall not serve thee, in thy respecting of persons, days and
times: they ought not to hinder thee: have thou thine heart prepared, and stick
thou to the graces of god offered. What are slanderous brutes to thee, if thou
be of god and a lover of the truth: of which truth, let thine own conscience
be the judge, if it be not utterly dead, or most damnably benu^med. When thou
hear the truth, in time take hold of truth, let not occasion slip from
thee, with her turned baldness toward thee: for she flies swiftly, and to
call her again back will not help thee: yea, the truth will the^ reprove thie, be
just judge over thee, and condemn thee to thy face, for thy most folishe
and late repentance Jf truth therefore offer her self unto thee, stand most
amiably before thee, and sound most heavenly words unto thine ear: O attend
then to the truth, have good opinion in the truth, sly not from the truth,
fear not the truth join to the truth, be familiar with the truth, believe the
truth, confess boldly the truth, and stand steadfastly to the truth: for
truth is of high excellency a glorious lady, a dame of noble fame and of
great antiquity: she is ever gracious unto the friendly, of full power also, of
great majesty, and familiar with the highest. Think well therefore of truth,
entertain her reverently, she shines with glory unto thee. O let her always
possess thee, rejoice in her company, and use her very friendly, for she will
highly again requite thee, and shen thee sone most freely, her natural usage
and property: which shall be, all inwardly to search thee, thoroughly to purge thee
most clearly to pollish thee, most beutifully to adorn thee to break thy
ba^ds of impiety, to make the spiritually free and prefer thee, through true
says to possess the high presence of the deity. This is truths nature, to
deal kindly with thee, if thou most unkindly, neglectest not her company. Of
which truth, the Apostle thus writes unto thee, that without al contradiction
she must needs be unto thee, either the sanoure of life unto life: or the
sauoure of death unto death. Such judgment will truth have over thee, and
stand in full effect, there will be no mean, but to be either with thee, or
else flatly against thee, as it shall truly find thee, at thy fall from this
life. there will be no dalia^ce: it will for ever save thee, or eternally damn
thee, how so ever thereof thou make thine account, or leanst of will to the
contrary, with thy very blind, wicked, and perverse heart. Fear therefore,
harken to the truth in time, have sure confidence in truth, thine helper is at
hand, be and the truth are one, he is grateful, he is faithful, dout thou not
double not, nor wilfully withstand not, the offered graces of thy mylde master,
thy just Lord, and most loving God: and be not before him, and in the presence
of his holy Angels, unprepared, or a dallier, a man indifferent, a slack
Simme, a drousie one, a lyngrer, a double deaier, a wanton, or a careless one,
among the reiectes and wretches of this world: that in their coldenesse,
darkness, hopeless houeryng, vain devising, wilfulness, tolitie,
forgeifulnesse, contempt of God and Godliness, tempts so high, so
magnificent, terrible and great God of majesty, most deadlily to danger them,
elues: who diversely in a moment, and in the twinkling of an eye, is able by his
justice to destroy thee, to crack suddenly in sunder the thread of thy life,
and to twine strongly the cords of thy perdurable and eternal death. Therefore
as he ought, in his mightiness, of every wighte to be feared: so he should not
of any one, either presumptuously or vainly be tempted. But for thy part, obey
him in his will, and suffer him with all patience, to try thee through
adversity, committing thy self wholely unto his only will and mercy: for
surely he will (beholding in thee the power of says) not suffer thee to be
tempted above thy strength, or yield thee so far to fall, but with his own
right hand, will raise thee quickly up again. And I exhort thee also to take
heed, that thou possess not in his sight at any time, an unstayed, often
wavering, and wind shaken heart, through Satan's blustrings, stormy and
tempestuous blastes, stirred up daily and hourly against thee, and that by
Gods permission for good: least by thine impaciencie, diffidente trembling,
and sore shakes of thine unchristian inconstancy, thou be suddenly turned to
thy shifts, put to thy faulty flight, and so be dispossessed of thy very
healthful, safe, and most sure hold: or else spoiled with reproach of thy
christen armor: or be occasioned by desperate pursuit, to starte from the face
of the ennimie, to stacker fearfully at his offered blows, and in hazard to
take hurt by some dangerous and sudden fal^ greatly to dishonor thee before
Christ thy captain: and with him infinite armies of heavenly soldiors: whose
tents (to encourage thee) are pitched round about thee. I say therefore unto
thee (O Christian) stand thou cherefully to thy charge in all things, and
defend manfully thine own: dismaie thee not J say: for the Lord God him
self will be thy defender and keeper, and will stand by thee to strengthen
thee, and to deliver thee from all dangers. And if legions of devils should
copasse thee, trench thee in round about, plant their power, and be^d forcibly
their shot against thee: well may they threatningly thunder far from thee,
rore, rattle and rumble in the air over thee, tumble terribly about thee,
parche something thy tender skin, and wonderfully in such sort amase thee: yet
shall they not prevail against thee, hurt any member of thee, or once remove
thy fast fixed soote, but shall stand sure fer ever, even as the high,
mighty, steadie, and strong mount Sion: for Gods arm stays thee, who by
his power has overcome the devil, even the great devil Sathanas him self,
he holds him at will by his infernal chains, his whole cursed army also,
hell gates, and all the powers of hell. O praise therefore thine almighty God:
exalt his glorious name for evermore, watch and pray continually: pray with
understanding, pray at al times, and in all places, as his holy spirit shall
move thee, for the upholding of thee, and for the avoiding of the engines,
sleights, and temptations of the enemies: that God himself may be pleased, thy
soul stre^gthned, the devils chased, vanquished, or put to flight. And when
thou prayest, deceive not vaynly thy self: be not blinded with the proud
Pharisie in thine own conceit, boasting of thy righteousness in the presence
of God, neither glorying in any thing: for he thoroughly beholds thee, and
sees that truly in thee, even thy secret and hid sins (a mass of all
abomination) as thou ought chiefly therein to be thine own judge. But
humble thy self before him, with the penitent and poor wretched Publicane,
confessing thy sins and wickedness: and fear not then to attain grace,
through such true faith and hu^blenesse. Moreover, forget not, that as God is
a most high, heavenly and divine substance, and a spirit of al goodness and
truth: so will he also of thee be spiritually worshipped, praised, and prayed
unto, eue^ in the truth, by the word of truth, and from the depth and bocome of
thine heart. This also I put thee in remembrance of (a thing greatly requisite)
that in the time of thy prayers, which thou daily consecratest to god (be they
more or less, long or short) thou be not withdrawn with the snarling
suggestions, secret twitches, inward motions, or wily sleightes of the enemy
Satan, thorough the abuse of thy senses and outward bodily members, as thine
eyes, thine ears, and such like: that whilst thy tongue only often babbleth,
and vaynely wastest much breath: thine heart, which God chiefly respects,
and does very gladly desire, be fardest off, and be most vaynely turned
another way, greatly to displease him, to vex sore thine own conscience, and
to make utterly frustrate al thine attempts, or importune suits of great
necessity. This I say also unto thee: If thou desire to be the child of God,
and void of al doubts so in deed to be, favor from thy heart Christ thy
forerunner and savior, by whose only grace thou art adopted the child of
God. Make not toward him, thy fidelity, crased, mingled, or patched: let it
go soundly and al whole together, both from thy body and thy soul. Let him
always enjoy from thee the whole and perfect man, the man regenerate and newborn, and made by his spirit the child of light, full of agilitie and
liveliness: whose soul mounting with felicity still up to the heavens, is
there resident with Christ the savior, and always conversant in heavenly
things. And let him also be evermore unto thee, thine only, whole, full,
perfect, and sufficient redemer, ear nest petitioner and ready pacifier of the
divine fury against thee for all causes: who with great glory (as thou sholdest
confess) is ascended on high, and sits with almightinesse, power and
majesty, on the right hand of his heavenly father, with open and fresh
bleeding wounds (the many fest marks and impressions before him for ever) of
the purchased and most preciouse redeemed inheritance, even for thee, most
notoriouse and deadly sinner, by the secret testimony of thine own
conscience. These things and such like, of thee thus christenly considered,
thou may be bold with thy most merciful and loving God. But yet again I
say unto thee, hold thee sure unto thy savior christ, swerve not from him, nor
from the virtue of his only merits, whereby thou must be only saved. Cleave
then close to the rock of assurance: lean to no loose nor sandy safety.
Trust not to the rottenness of our humane devises, labor not to languish in a
maze of uncertainty. Bemoyle not thy self in such mire of mortality, and
shun soon such shoures as will wrecke thy souls fidelity. Then cry (as J
said) and cease not to crave pardon of God thy father in his son: name,
'Doubte not of thy suit, what so ever it be, for it shall by good motion be so
upright, so reasonable, so acceptable before him and allowable: and shall touch
therewith so near the tenderness of his mercy, his truth and fidelity, that
of necessity grant must be made unto thee: he will not deny thee the
requests of thy lips: yea, he will so graciously tender thee, that foreseing
thy cause of inward complaynte, he will prepare quickly thine heart most
faithfully to call upon him. Believe therefore faithfully, trust of assurance,
and thou shalt surely obtain thy desire, with great mercy and fanour at his
holy hand. Thy sins shall not be imputed unto thee, thou shalt be blessed
and righteouse in the sight of God all the days of thy life, so happily shall
thine heart be prepared: so mightily shall thy prayers prevail for thee: they
will forcibly pearce the celestial and high heavens: approach near to the
only throne of grace and majesty: cry incessantly for thee, and will not
return from the presence of God, nor once be satisfied, before the full grant
of their humble suit, for thy saving health and commodity. To conclude in all
thy godly attemptes, whether in praying, fasting, giving of Alms, frequenting
the holy Sacraments, or rendering most hearty thanks unto God, for his
infinite Mercies, Graces, Blessings and Benefits bestowed upon thee, and
upon his whole Church, from the beginning until this present day: and what
soever in holiness thou commendest daily unto him: let it always be done
uprightly, orderly, with christian comeliness, and modesty, with peace of
conscience, faithfully, constantly, cherefully, and in charity, as the only
word of God most straitely byndeth thee. Which I pray to God may clearly
shine into thee by the power of his holy spirit: who quicken thee this day, to
morrow, and for ever, and kindle in thee toward him, the fiery flames of his
true love, through his son Christ Jesus: who speedely grant thee the same
signement of his holy hand, and satisfy thee with inward joy, in all thy most
lowefull and divine desires. Amen.

FINIS.
A devout meditation of the godly Christian, with a brief Confession and
Prayer.
WHen I (O heavenly father) through the glory of thine only eternal gracs am
eue^ in the midst of many muses, lamentable mournings, deep sighings, and
inward monings to my self, most happily stirred to the due consideration of my
self, and in what perilous state I ever stand here in this wretched world,
how in the breuity thereof I am compassed with many miseries, with grievous
plagues and punishments, with dreadful calamities, perilles, and dangers, with
diverse maladies sicknesses aand infirmities both of body and mind: The mercy
and grace of God ^n the hearts of his elect, to consider in this life their
dangerous and miserable state for sin.
how by the mighty power also and policy of mine ancient and most deadly
enemy the old subtle serpent, this deceitful vain world, as also mine own
weakness, corruption, apt inclination, and most vile subjection to sin, I am
daily assaulted and tempted to sin, and in committing sin, become the
servant of sin, and must acordingly look for death the just reward of sin:
because diversely therewith and damnably (through disobedience and the breach of
thy law, in thought, word and deed) I have and do most grievously offend the
will of thy Majesty, and am become thereby a very Sathanist, the child of the
devil, to hasten thy furies upon me, that he should use his tira^nie against me
(for so witnesses by accusation my wounded conscience,) whereby my soul is
daily dysquieted, sore clogged, greatly destled, maruelously amassed, made
monstruouse before thee, and hated of thee: whereunto (my freedom and
innocence being lost) of my own concupiscence am accustomably blinded,
Concupiscence and the malice thereof.
drawn and entised: and by the malice thereof, both understanding, heart and
will are holden captive and in deadelie slavery to the devil, The devil the
only author of concupiscence and sin.
the only author and beginner of all evil concupiscence and sin. By which
occasto^, in stead of healthsome and profitable things, I often desire very
noisome, most pernicious and hurtful things. And my soul also which in the
excellency thereof, through reason and the uprightness of the inward man,
should bear the beauty of thy heavenly and most glorious image in perfect
purity and innocence, through the corruption thereof is sowly deformed and
sore blemished, and made accordingly his evil favored and most filthy image,
The souls de formitie through sin.
and so woorthily by thy justice shaken off, and cast from the presence of thy
deity. True faith in the abou^ding mercies of God.
So that hereby (O Lord) thou have yet by the continuance of thy grace moved
me to consider, that if thy mercies did not abound upon me, or that thy
gracious favor, should now or at any time, in this most deadly plight
utterly forsake me, and not rather co^fortably with speedy and most swift sway
turn again toward me, and bring therewith from thine heavenly presence, the
distilling moystures, and large flowing streams of thy celestial dew,
plentifully drawn from the sweet fountains of my savior, to refresh,
comfort, make whole again, cleanse and beautify, my very leprous, most
sinful and sick soul, and of thy mere mercy to reduce her to her
pristinate and former state: The miserable state of the sick Soul, without
true faith in the fre mercy of god.
my case should be most miserable, my bands should be indissoluble, I should
become a cursed reject, and remain a fire brand of hell for ever. But as thy
love (O Lord) is unspeakable, and thy fatherly mercy toward me infinite,
which willest not the death of a sinner, but rather he should fourne from his
wickedness and live, and offrest him time and space to repent and amend: The
feeling of the grace of god.
so haste thou now in mercy remembered me, looked back again upon me, cheared
and comforted me, increased true faith in me, thy spirit has renewed me,
stirred me to call most humbly unto thee, set me free from the ennemie, pitied
my souls deformity, prepared the most healthful remedy: for the blood of thy
son Jesus has cleansed me, whereby thou haste so quickened me, that my soul
reioyseth within me, The humble submission and confession of the faithful
Soul.
with most earnest tears it repents me that ever I sinued against thee, I
fall flat to the earth before thee, confessing my sins unfeignedly, my
weakness and infirmity, for I have most grievously offended thee, my
conscience therein accuses me, and cry yet with true says unto thee: Mercy
good Lord mercy, with thanks giving and extolling thee, for thine infused
grace upon me. A calling unto God for comfort and strength.
And I pray thee most humbly (O my God of all mercy) to continue thy
fatherly affection, the increasing of thy grace, and strength of thy spirit
upon me, to help, to direct and comfort me, unto the end, and in the end in
all my temptations, troubles, weakness and infirmities both of body and
mind: Least satan (as I said) prevail and confound me, the tickling
pleasures of this world deceive me, and the old man my wretched flesh, which
is not yet subject to the spirit, do master me: The fight of the faithful
Soul.
against all which, I must arm my self, stand to the battle, continually
fight, bold out at the swoordes point, offer the prick, drive back, chase,
overthrow, wound and confound, whilst breath shall hold in this wretched
body: yea, I say wretched in deed, being compassed with so many calamities and
infinite miseries: for the which cause, (O Lord) I crave always thy mighty
power, in my weakness I make my moan, haste thee now to help me, O
strengthen me, grant me thy presence, stand by me, encourage me to fight
manfully, that by thee I may amaze the enemies, put them fast to flight, get
the victory, triumph before thee, and extol thee in thy great might and
mercy, now and for ever: through Jesus Christ our Lord: who lives and
reigns with thee and the holy Ghost in all honor and glory world without
end. Amen.

II. To dvvell in the service of God, to have the world, and the pleasures
thereof in contempt, and to strive daily against them with the armor of
righteousness.
FOr as much (O almighty God) as we are all warned by thine holy Apostle
John, not to be lovers of this evil world, nor the vain pleasures thereof,
because both the one and the other come utterly to naught: and that also to
be a lover of the world, is to be an hater of thee, What danger they fall into
that forsake god, and lean to the world and the pleasures thereof.
to slip from thy will, and from the presence of thy majesty, as one that
regards thee not, knows thee not, neither seek to know thee, but startle
aside from thee, forsakes the right way, and enters of will the perrillous
way full of hid thistles, thorns, briers, brambles, venomous worms and
serpents: linking also the^ selves into the amity, league and service, of the
most sleightie, hateful and deadly enemy, the proud Prince of this world,
who for a time by Gods permission is broken lose, and rages in his course,
roareth and fights continually against the Soul of man: who entangleth only
his own to their utter overthrow, with the vain pleasures thereof: even with
the delights in effect but of one hour, and with the increasing of sorrows
for many years: The service of God, what it is.
I beseech thee (O thou king of all holiness) whose service is most high,
most happy, most sure, most healthful, wealthful, heavenly, perpetual,
perfect selicitie and freedom:) which see the weakness, inconstancy,
great misery, and necessity of me thine humble servant: the outrage also
and power of my cruel adversaries: grant me sufficiency of thy grace, and
strength of thine holy spirit, that by virtue thereof, I may be directed in
ye way wherein I should walk, my paths made strait, and my foot steadfast,
always to withstand the evil attemptes of the most wicked, and the outward
glittering gloryes of this sinful and vain world, and not yield my mind to
the pleasures and comforts of the same, as a child of vanity, enclosed therein
for ye time, as in a deep dungeon of danger, and of deadly darkness, The
world, a deep dongeon, wherein the children of vanity are enclosed.
founded upon a sandy and rotten soil, very old, ruinous, sore shaken, and
ready at every momente to fall, through age upon me: but to be otherwise
staide by thine holy and mighty arm, pacientlie in the mean season to abide
thy will, to lay my foundation sure, to be sober and watchful over all
dangers, to stretch forth mine hands to the battle, to strengthen mine
arms like a bow of steel, that under thy protection and power, I may manfully
resist all hurtful euilles, and the assaults of the wicked, and stand stably to
my profession in thy holy service, whereunto through thy grace I am called, to
the end, that by thine only help, I should do the works of righteousness. O
thou rightuous Lord and God of my strength, which haste made me, which have
conserved me, and art most loving and careful over me, I putting mine only
hope and confidence (not in the holy Angels, celestial spirits, blessed
Saints in heaven, or good men here in earth) but only in thee, suffer me not
to be tempted above my strength, or to be overwhelmed of mine own
co^cupisce^ce: but in the midst of temptation, make thou a way for me to escape
with joy. Thou (O God) art only omnipotent, most gracious, full of al
goodness, faithfulness and truth: fulfill therefore thy promises toward me,
most merciful Lord, thou God of truth: Put upon me thine whole armor of
rightuousenesse, Armoure of rightuousenesse.
O thou God of might and true holiness, that by thy power I may be strong
against all adversaries: for I wrestle not (as thou know) against flesh and
blud in this life: but against rule, against power, and against worldly rulers
of the darkness of this world, and against spiritual wickedness in
heavenly things: by whom, without thine heavenly power I stand ever in
hazard to eternal destruction both of body and soul. For which cause (I
say) O my sweet God, arm me strongly, strengthen me in my weakness, and
make me stout, that in this christen chivalry, Christian chivalry.
I may stand perfect in all things before thee, and not slip by cowardice or
inconstancy from thy faithful service: but fight under thy banner until the
last breath, The sight of a christian (...) in the service of god must be
continual and courageous.
courageously putting mine euemyes to flight, and carry away with triu^ph, a
glorious victory over them. So shall it come to pass, that thoroughly running
this so shorfe a race in my holy calling as a puissant warrior in thy most high
and excellent service, with lawful striving, and with violent plucking toward
me thine heavenly kingdom, I shall in the end perfectly see it and possess
it, and shall receive in mine hands a Palm of victory, Palone of victory.
Crown of glory. Hid Manna. And a White stone.
upon mine head, a Crown of glory prepared, the hid Manna also and a white
stone, wherein is written a new name, which no man knows, saving only the
receiver of it: who shall serve thee thou great God of heaven, in the most
sacred state of true holiness, perfect free dome, excellency, dignity, and
equality with thine holy Angels and al blessed Saints, in everlasting
felicity. Grant this mine humble petition (O Lord) for thy great mercies
sake: So shall I here, and in eternal blessedness, extol and magnify thy
glorious name. Amen.

III. For the humble hearing, apt receiving, keeping, and continuing of the
word of God amongst us.
COnsidering (o thou God of al holiness) that the certainetie of our
Christian faith, stands by the Scryptures or immovable word of thy
truth: which, as thy messenger proceeds from thee by thy gracious
inspiration or secreate brething: whereunto, as unto a seast royal, every man of
al nations under heaven are called: The scriptures of God, only received of the
faithful.
but are of thy Church only received and devoutly used, to the instruction,
confirmation, strengthening and establishing of thine only faithful and true
flock: and be, as thy blessed Apostle calls them, sacred and holy: birause
they be heavenly, most precious, divine, healthful, and comfortable to the
soul, excelling all the wisdom of Philosophers, and the vainly wise of this
world, and be therefore (in their high power and majesty) woorthily above all
advanced, segregate, and put aparte by them selves, from all other wrytings of
profane matters and the flitting descriptions of men: not only pertaining to
this present world, and for the use of this temporal life: but also from all
Ethnicke superstitians, Superstitions, false worship pings. etc.
salse woorshippings, wicked sacrifices and erroneous opinions, used contrary
to thy word, and against thee the only eternal and true God: which, by lying,
custom and cruelty, are corruptly crepte into thy Church, to the foul
feeding, filling, defiling, and poisonning thereof, and is yet daily occasioned
thereby wout thy grace, to be sinisterly drawn and seduced, straying from the
right way, and haled to death by will in our selves, from the life that is in
thee, even to eternal death and destruction: we beseech thee most humbly (O
thou gracious God) to enspire us with thy holy spirit of truth, and to kindle
in all our hearts the fire of thy love, light and truth: that by thy power in
them, our faithes may be strengthened, our souls also humbled, rightly led
and instructed, in thy word of love, light, truth, and of eternal life: by
virtue whereof, Our profession in holy Baptism.
at our first entrance to Christ our high Pastor, we may truly understand our
profession and promise in holy baptism, and have it accordingly written with
thy finger of grace in our hearts, to the true knowledge of thy law, and the
spiritual understanding thereof, to love thee most woorthily above all, and our
neighbor as our selves: as also to know the promises of thy mercy in thy
son our Savior Jesus Christ most soundly and purely, as thy holy word
expresses therein: whereby we may be well vpholden, and zealously staide in
our profession, to tread our paths right, to be guided by the true light, to
hear gladly the voice of our shepherd Jesus Christ, to testify his name,
to follow him the only true light, and not to fear the powers of darkness,
but to overcome them by thy might (although even with the loss of our lives)
not only the dalyings, dim devises and vanities of the wicked, and to shun
all such hateful enemics, Enemies of Gods word.
as are usual mockers, daily deprauers, sinful despisers, wilful
impugners, wicked seducers, double dealers, back sliders, and pluckers back
from thy word, but also the sleights of their father Satan, the enticements of
the world, and the filthy motions of the flesh. And to that happy end (O
Lord) we may be constant, and thy word ever abide in us, stir us up to
continual and hearty prayer, quicken our zeal, Hearty prayer to God, makes
us constante in the word of God.
and work in us, a true, lively, quick, and fruitful faith: that it being
a bright shining light in our hearts, to the expelling of all Hypocrisy,
cloudinesse, darkness and error, and also our conversation being answerable
to our profession, the continuance of thy grace may still comfortably shine
upon us, thy holy word may continue amongste us, may be truly preached unto
us, diligently, boldly, and zealously uttered over al, and by all the ministers
thereof, by what occasion, time and place so ever it be: for unto us that shall
be saved, The word of God, what it is, and how of the godly to be considted.
it is a thing most precious and holy: It is the word of life, the word of
reconciliation, the lantern unto our feet, and a light unto our paths, the
fountain of wisdom, the bread of life, the food of the soul, thy mighty
power, and swoorde of the spirit. And for as much (O heavenly father) as thy
words thus to vswarde (come from heaven) are spirit and life, and are not to
be wayed with the vain imagination, policy, wisdom or wit of man, nor yet
to be applied unto the hurtful pleasures of this sinful world, but to be
most holily and highly esteemed, most humbly had in credit, reverently
thought upon, gladly inclined unto, heard with silence, and received with all
modesty and ghostly greediness: we humbly beseech thee, that as thou haste
ever heretofore ben the only gracious director, instructor and teacher of thy
holy Patriarks and Prophets, God the only instructour of all, in all ages.
Apostles and holy fathers from time to time from the beginning, and amongste
al men (for thine electes sake in Jesus Christ) continuest yet so still until
this day: O train us up also in thine heavenly knowledge we pray thee: prepare
our hearts, teach us thy law, and write thy words of life in the tables of
our hearts: that in these our monstrous days of most wilful vanity, An
apt Prayer for these our days.
which in their strangeness cries out (by plagues) to be punished, we may
aforehande be warned, we may be yet better schooled, thy wrath thereby
prevented, our souls more spiritually nourished, filled with thy favor, more
mortified daily from the vanities of this brickel life, guided to more
thristian modesty and tempera^ce, affected solie to the way of holiness,
comforted in all troubles and adversities, boldned manfully against the face of
ye enemies, stayed, well armed and strengthened against all temptations,
stirred up to the increase of all virtues: that thy words (which shall judge
us in the last day) being by thy ministers truly preached, and of us also as
zealously embraced, and by any means not to be despised or slandered, but on
all parts surely holden, and to show for the accordingly the true fruits of
righteousness, we may be called of thee, thy holy disciples, and avoid I say
the sal of thy ve^gea^ce amongst us, thy judgment also to eternal condemnation
and be received in time to everlasting salvation: through thy grace and the
only merits of thy son our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

IIII. For Faith.
BY reading or hearing thy holy word (O blessed savior) we are taught, that
true faith which is thine only gift, is only thereby attained: and that by
the power of thine heavenly spirit it is breathed into the only hearts of all
thine elect, who receive it by measure and quantity according to the will and
power of the same spirit: and with thine eyes beholding it in them, thou
gloriest in them, thou daily blessest them, thou encreasest it in them, thy
countenance shines upon them, thou amiably appearest and she west thy self
unto them: yea so acceptable it is in thy sight (O sweet savior) that thou
being the king of eternal glory and majesty, Faith only breathed into the
hearts of Gods elect.
art espoused to the souls of the faithful, and make them thereby to be
partakers with thee of thine heavenly and divine nature, through the wonderful
operation of thine holy spirit. We are taught by thine holy Apostle, that what
so ever is not of this faith, is sin, and that there is no possibility
without it to please thee, or to find grace by suit at thine holy hand. And
therefore all they that come unto thee, True faith in Christ.
must in deed firmly believe, that thou art very God and very Man: yea, and
such a God of might, of mildness and great mercy above all Gods, as both
can and ever will hear, incline thine ear, and abundantly reward all them,
that with lively and true faith seek thee, and unfeignedly desire to find
thee, or to be relieved by thine holy hand. By this faith (O Lord) we also
obtain of God thy father, all good things: yea, what so ever we crave at his
hand in thy name. Faith justifies.
Through this faith also, so many as believe are justified, made the sons and
heirs of God, and enjoy most certainly thereby the reward of everlasting
life. O Lord Jesus, great is the power and working of this faith, The power of
Faith.
for by it the consciences of the godly are quieted, by it they truly know
thee the only high and eternal God: by it they love and fear thee, be
constant toward thee, strong and pacient in all adversity, their hope is firm
for things to come: by it they conceive boldness to repair to the throne of
thy grace for mercy, to have sure trust in thee, to invoke thine holy name,
to adore and worship it, to confess the truth before thee, to obey it most
gladly, to persevere therein most willingly, to withstand the force of all
tyranny, to yield up in time their spirit, and to go through faith to thine
and their heavenly father. Seeing then (O graciouse God and Savior) that this
virtue is so heavenly, so holy, so mighty, so acceptable and preciouse in thy
sight, that without it nothing can be well pleasing the will of thy majesty,
or to serve happily our own turns: and we also of such frailty can not
attain to this most singular treasure, except it come from above (even from
thee) and infused into our hearts by the grace of thine holy spirit: we most
heartily beseech thee (by the power thereof) to make clean our hearts, to
purge them of all error, darkness, and ignorance, of all mistrust,
infidelity, and unfaithfulness, and to plant most speedely in us, a true,
lively, and undoubted faith, in the blessed and most glorious Trinity: in
God our heavenly father, in thee (O God) our only savior, and in the holy
ghost our most dear and sweet comfortour: by whom alone, we be all highly
blessed, preciously redeemed, and eternally sanctified: and that also for thine
only sake (O blessed savior) thine heavenly father is well pleased with us,
our sins clearly remitted unto us. This faith (O sweet Jesus) daily
increase in us, help most graciously our unbelief, O Lord strengthen us from
faith to faith: that we may at the last through thine accustomed grace, be
made perfectly faithful, constante warriors, and valiant conquerors, in the
defense of thine holy religio, against the power of Satan, the world, and
Antichriste: and in all things to she we our selves in this life, both in our
profession and manners, truly and frutefully faithful, even to the high
exaltation and praise of thy name: which live and raignest, with God the
father, and God the holy Ghost, true and perfect God, our only mediator and
advocate, world without end. Amen.

V. To the attainement of Grace, and for the due examination of such desires
and motions, as are put daily into our minds.
BEholding (O God our maker) the miserable state of ma^kinde in this life, how
diversely therein and in finitely he is continually beset, The miserable state
of man in this life.

among the low shrubbes, lurking stubbes, stumbling blocks, craggie rocks,
dead pits, trappes, catches, snares, grinnes, furious and fierce beasts, in
the wilderness of this world to present destruction: always uncertain and
fearful through danger, whereunto (in his ways) he may lean or trust,
wandering in this desert among doutful chances, void of certain hope, far
off from comfort, forsaken of friends, beset with many enemies, and entised
diversely to sundry desires and motions, and so most greenously perplexed, and
inwardly afflicted in mind, musing before thee (O Lord) in thine heavenly
presence, upon his most wretched state, what shall betide him, knows not
what to do, which way to turn him, whether to flee, not certain of his end,
ignorant, when, how, and where he shall end his days, and leave to earth
his most wretched and earthie carcass: Man posses seth in himself two powers,
and of sundly inclinations.

which is, a willing consent to vain pleasures bredde in the corrupted flesh:
or otherwise, a more apt inclination to the good will and motion of the spirit,
which are both contrary the one to the other, and the one continually warring
or waging battle against the other: whose fight (if there be resistance) are
both very violente to prevail, and stirs daily the soul to great unrest.
Which powers or parts of man (O Lord) in the time of innocence, before the
fall of my first parents, had coupled them together in most blessed

cause of discord.
and cannot live joined together, without contynuall war, ruffeling and
wrangling together as things diverse, although in deed but one: I beseech
thee therefore (O my God the great God and maker of heaven and earth) to
behold with great compassion, my miserable state among the rest in this most
woeful and grievous conflicte, my great frailetie and weakness without thy
grace, my darkness and ignorance, and the power of sin raygning in mine
earthely and mortal members: that as thou art God the author of peace, the
true light and guide, and the only God of my strength, to prevail for me by
thine holy spirit, against the Prince of sedition and darkness, of fraud and
deceit, Prince of sedition.
of error and lies, and the corrupted motions of the sinful flesh: so
grant me the strength of thy grace, a lively and quick feeling faith also
in thy promises through Christ: that thereby my spirit being always
prepared, quickened and directed by thy spirit, it may yield to the only
quickening and good motions thereof: that by the heavenly power of it, I may at
all times be constante in them, and learn perfectly by due examination, The

of thine holy will, I give thine offered grace most gracele sly the slip:
becoming in thy sight but a fugitive, a reage, a runneagate, a corner
creeper, a vain dullarde, gross, earthie, lumpishe and heavy, void of spirit
and life, dark in true judgment, affected to vain desires, most wickedly
falling from thee, forsaken also of thee, given over to my self, wretchedly
wandering at will or at the wild adventure, and stand as a dead pray to the
will of al devouring adversaries: even to ye sleights of the most curssed
serpente, to the sugared baits of this deceitful world, and to the filthy
desires of the rebellious flesh: by whom I shall be most wickedly seduced,
most horribly blinded and fowly corrupted: and so trained on in a short race
to the slaughter, even to the swalowing gulffe of despair, the bottomless
hurlepwle, or most deep sink of destruction. O my god of al mercy and grace,
The power of the spirit of light and truth.
that art the only helper of me in all my necessities, assist and comfort my
soul with thy spirit of light and truth: that I may now and at all times
both truly discern, retain with good will, and follow, the only good motions
thereof, and forcibly withstand the contrary: that no prouocations, venomous
enticementes, or poisoned pleasures of the flesh, be occasions to defile and
hazard my soul. But following the good desires of the spirit (which are most
pure, perfect and godly,) and my soul ever mindful of her celestial nature,
enforsing her self upward to the high heavens before thy presence: there may
spring up unto me (all the days of my life) the good continuance of thy grace,
the blessed tra^quillitie of an innocent mind, the reaped fruits also of a
good spirit, and lastly in time everlasting life, which thou have prepared for
me through thine only mercy and grace, in the merits of thy son and my savior
Iesue Christ. Amen.

VI. For the chastising of the Soul, to keep it low and in subjection.
WE be taught of thee (O thou GOD of heaven) that who so ever will rightly
prosper in this life, The way and mean to plese God in this life.
and go daily forwards in true godliness worthy thy well liking, must taste
substantially of thine heavenly wisedeme, and enter the way thereto with all
lowly subjection, holding still fast thy reverent fear, esteeming unfeignedly
the way of thy testimonies, and be always very watchful, that he offend not
thy sight. It behooves us therefore (O Lord) in the state of our great
weakness and frailetie, and in our darkness and deadly ignorance, to have
daily access to thee (thou God of our power, true light and wisdom) by
prayer and most humble suit, that we may seek by thine heavenly wisdom to
know thee truly, and to have thy fear before our eyes: that in our profession
we may be ever constante, pacient and strong in thee, avoiding through thy grace
al careless security, wa^dring inconstancy and slippernesse: keeping all our
powers under thine holy discipline, Holy discipline.
without repining or murmuring, and not yield up our selves (according to the
will of the flesh) to flying vanities, and the swifte flitting things of this
world: but cleave steadfastly unto thee, and give over our selves wholely,
patiently to abide thy holy will, to the quickening of us in our dullness and
human fearfulness, and to the sweet chastening of our untoward and drousie
souls. Doubtless (O Lord) very great, sweet and pleasant to the godly, is
the commodity of thy chastisements, and the exercises of thy cross, Exercises
of the cross.
to the increase of godliness among thy children, and to suppress the will of
the proud flesh: which, otherwise to the contrary, would be soon overwhelmed
with too much pride, iolitie, forgetfulness, flouth and carelessenesse. Quicken
us therefore (O Lord) with the rod of thy favor, visit at times our
graceless dullness: yt we may feel thereby the touch of thy grace, the
sorrows also of our minds in our offenses, and call our own ways to
remembrance, that we may say with the holy Prophet: It is good for me Lord that
I have been punished, and that to this happy end, that I may learn thy
statutes. Again, before I was troubled, I went wrong. etc. O grant unto us
most loving God, that with thy rod of fatherly correction, we may judge our
selves happy, and rejoice with thy holy prophet least to the contrary, The
inconuenieuce that comes by sufferance and cuill custom.
by sufferance and evil custom, or having our reane of wantonness too much at
liberty, we too too much deceive our selves, and in our forgetfulness, laughe
at our own wickedness, when rather most bitterly we should bewail our
sinfulness, and remember thereby the infinite dangers to the soul, how it is
compassed, suttlely deceived, holden captive and thr^l to the devil. And we
must confess unto thee (O our god) yt we stand not at any time in true
liberty or joy effectual in any thing, unless we possess by thy spirit thy
reverent fear, and that also joined with a peaceable and quiet conscience. O
what a happiness therefore is it to a man, to cast freely from him, al
impedime^ts and lettes of worldly vanities, and yield him self wholely under
thine hand of discipline, He is happy, that humbles him self to discipline.
and to the chastening of his soul. Grant us (O Lord) to be so happy, that
we may daily renounce and put from us, what so ever may stain and burden our
most tender, weak, and simple consciences. Grant unto us in this world of
warfare, strength of thy grace, that we may fight the battle of christian
soldiers, and overcome by custom, the usual supporter of all evil. Grant
us grace (O merciful Lord) that we may stand steadfastly to our charge, yield
with patience to thy will, and in all things to take straight view of our
selves, and cheefely with our own eyes to behold well our selves, that in thy
sight we be all well armed, and so always prevent the warning of others, to
the overthrow of the dedly adversary. Grant this (o heavenly father) with
humbleness of heart we beseech thee, to the quick ening and strengthening of
our souls in all temptations and chastisements: and stir up daily in them,
thine heavenly sparks and sweet motions of comfort, to their most happy
rejoicing, and to the exaltation of thy most glorious name in this life, and
in the everlasting world to come: through thy son Christ our Lord. Amen.

VII. For patience in adversity, and to remember that this world is but a
place of perigrioation, or passing forwards unto an other world.
WHen thou in mercy (O lord) beholdest thine own, and feast them among others
how hazardly unto deadly dangers they daily offer them selves, raunging abroad
at adventure like lost sheep, Man in present danger. God at hand to deliver.
and ready to be torn of every savage and devouring beast: thou by and by of
thy fatherly and tender pity, considerest their miserable state and condition,
and how needful it is for them to be sought out with diligence, to be
brought home again to the fold, or to be pinned in, Pynches to the proud
flesh are sometime necessary.
favorably pinched a while in some bare pasture, and sometime to be kept low
with thy mild touch of calamities and adversities, to abate their courages,
and to let their lively leapes and out girdes: by means whereof, they be often
called again, better to remember them selves, and whereby they may also have
thee the more in mind, and truly to know their own state in this life,
whereunto they are called, and to whose service, to walk in the ways of thy
precepts, to keep them ever within their bounds and that during their short
race, they live here but as exiles or as Pilgrims far from their own home,
not to live here in felicity, Man for a time is but an exile from his home,
and a pilgrim.
not to regard the pleasures of this world, either yet to put their hope and
affiance in them, but to use the^ without abuse (as by the way) and but for
their only necessities homward: we most humbly beseech thee (O thou father of
all mercy) that thou will daily renew thy compassion upon us, that thou will
tender us in our frailty, lustiness and vain iolitie, that in our offenses
thou will with mercy reform us, and not utterly by thy justice confound us: but
seek mildely for us, call us gently home to thy sheepfold, with mercy embrace
us, and keep us together for ever in one, in the sweet unity, fellowship and
amity of thy flock. And if at any time, we shall hencefoorthe wander abroad
and go astray, whereby we shall offond thee, and justly incur thy most heavy
wrath and displeasure: we crave yet at thine holy hand to remember thy mercy,
and so (in the time of correction) to temper it with thy justice: that we thy
children by adoption and grace, may largely taste in that respect, the comfortes
of thy most tender and fatherly goodness: that as we shall for our
disobedience and sin, The Justice of God and sin are not clearly severed in
this life among the children of God.
justly feel some part of thy justice, and have therefore great cause of
inward grief and heaviness, and occasioned daily to groan in our hearts for
our speedy deliverance from thy rod of correction, and to attain again the
bright countinunce of thy favor: so we may also in the mean time, possess a
lively faith, show forth the fruits of the same, pray continually unto
thee, and bear patiently thy holy will with all thankfulness all the days of
our lives: through the only grace of the high pastor and chief shepherd of
our souls, thy son our Lord and only savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

VIII. To be humble in the sight of God.
O My lord God, which art mine only goodness, a God of great Majesty, and to
be blessed for ever: I most poor and wretched sinner, Man but a worm, duste,
and ashes.
most vile woorme, dust and ashes: and of all others most unworthy thy grace
and favor: yet beholding thy great mercy, thy truth and fidelity, thy usual
and approved clemency, toward all humble and penitent sinners: I among the
rest, (but a lump of earth, and shaken by thy power to dust in a moment:) do
prostrate my self upon the earth, bewailing before thee my most sinful
state, crying with the Prophet, peccaui, peceaui, and with repentante tears
call for thy mercy.

O my GOD almighty and my maker, which truly know me thy creature even as
I am, and searchest thoroughly in me, the very secrets of the heart and raines:
If I should in thy sight (being nothing of my self) esteem any thing of my
self or else glory in any thing besides thee under the sun, thou would as
thou might by due justice against me, woorthily reprove me and condemn me
with the rest, as most vain and for naught. Yea, Man most vain and naught.
mine own sins would accuse me unto thee, and my conscience very terribly
cry out against me: for I am before thee but a thing of naught, and my sins
have thou sealed up against me, to the terrifying always of me, and to incur
daily in my mind diverse incommodities and inward anguishes, to mine own
overthrow and confusion. But humbling my self before thee (O my God) and
esteeming of my self, as (in deed I am) but vile duste and ashes, and cast
utterly from me all estimation of my self, being pressed down (as it were) to
nothing: then I trust I shall obtain thy mercy, then shall I hope to possess
the happy peace, Man's humble subjection before God, attayneth the grace mercy
and peace of God.
then shall I feel true joy in my self: for thy presence shall be even at
hand, thy grace shall comfort me, thy good spirit shall quicken me, thy
favorable countinance shall cheer me up, and thine heavenly light approach
near mine heart: whereby it shall most blessedly happen, that where I have
heretofore most vainly esteemed, but the least thing of my self, the same
very vain or small estimation conceived, shall suddenly consume and vanishe to
naught for ever: and shall thencefoorth by the hand of thy majesty, be so
vndor propped and graciously holden up, that I shall never decline from due
consideration of my self, what I am of my self, what I have been, by whom I
have my being, and from whence I am come: namely, of nothing, and from nothing:
and being so left unto my self, I shall be found nothing, but only as a
shadow, or mere infirmity and weakness. Man a thing of nothing.
Therefore, I most humbly beseech thee (O thou father of al mercy) the only
assured stay of thine inheritance, which severely chasest away the vain glory
of man, turn a little toward me, tender me in my weakness, and show me
the strength of thy countenance, that immediately in thee I may be strong, and
newely cheered up with inward and heavenly gladness: that being entered into
most sudden admiration with my self, to see my self in a moment, by thy
fatherly embracement, raised up to heaven; which by mine own pronenesse and
waighte of sin, was before carried down to hell, I may thank thee my most
sweet and loving God, and praise thee with an humble and most lowly heart,
with continual modesty, zealously, religiously and godly, in thought, word
and deed: through thy mercy and grace in thy son Jesus Christ all the
days of my life. Amen. Amen.

IX. Of true obedience and subjection, to such as be in authority, according
to the word of God.
FOr as much (O heavenly father) as it is rather available for men in this
world, to be in subjection to other, It is better for a man to obey, than to
lean to his own sway.
than to lean to their own only sway and leude liberty: and so, much more
safely to obey, than to bear rule, and have all at commandment: with all
humbleness we beseech thee, to direct us with thy spirit of humility and
lowelinesse, and to be always in subjection to authority, according to thy
word by the rule of thine holy Apostle: not only for fear, for necessity,
and therefore painefully: but rather of true love, duetifully, most gladly,
and that for conscience sake.

For otherwise (O Lord) we slip from our Christian profession, true
obedience, and most reuerente subjection, and attaind not the true libertis of
mind, and the showing of obedyence from the heart, and for Gods sake: The
inconvenience that comes by disobedience.
but fall of will most wickedly, and as bond slaves, into the sin of
hatred, contempt, murmuring, grutching, conspiring, rebelling, and into
innumerable such like, as men being wholely given over to a wicked will,
runnyng headlong into all kind of mischeefes: whereby we become as resectes,
and cast awayes from thy glorious favor: we purchase thy displeasure, thou
(...) our treacheries, the curse of the people shall fall upon us, the spoil
of the innocents, and their blood shed shall cry for vengeance against us,
our days shall be shortened, our offspring and family ashamed; utterly
confounded, contempned, and for ever brought to naught. O gracious God, grant
therefore that we may ever regard thy will, be mindful of thy statutes, fear
thy indgements, and consider with our selves, our christian obedience and
duty toward authority, walking humbly in our vocation before thee, to
the vpholdyng of peace, to the contenting of authority, to render unto them
their duty, to the benefiting of our Country, to the blessing of our
posterity, and to remember also with this assured persuasion, that whether so
ever we turn our selves in thus life, we shall not aptly find rest in any
place, if we be seditious, mischeeuously inclined, traitorous, conspirators or
rebellyous: The judgments of God over seditious rebels.
for thy judgments will still follow us, thy swoorde shall devour us, and
cruel messengers shall be sent against us, as of many we have both herd,
read, and often times known amongst us. For thou (O Lord) in the feruor of thy
zeal, neither can nor will suffer the higher powers, so to be disobeyed or
unnaturally spurned against: but thou will by thy justice see it sharply
revenged, as the offense verily committed, against the person of thine
eternal majesty. Give us grace therefore (O heavenly father) we humbly
beseech thee, to way reverently thy will in thy word, and accordingly to live
in all subjection to the higher powers, to pray daily and most heartily for
them, Princes and Magistrates are the most apt Instruments stirred of God, to
further his glory here upon earth.
as for the apt instruments of thy grate, and furtherers of thy glory, at
these days of true light, yt thou will touch daily and deeply all their
hearts, with the finger of thine heavenly grace, that thy principal spirit may
for ever possess them, and that thy blessings also may daily abound both
upon them, upon us, and upon our posterity (as upon the children of true
obedience, peace and humbleness) to our reioying and praising of thy glorious
name, until the end of this life and for ever: through Jesus Christ our
only Lord and Savior. Amen.

X. For the Queens most excellenre Majesty, for her Honorable
Councelloures, her whole Court or family.
O Almighty God and father of all mercy, which graciously gouernest, most
wisely rulest, and abundantly blessest here upon earth, thy great
Congregation, the pillar and ground of truth, the flocks of Christ, thine
holy Church, the Spouse of Christ, the elect vessels of thy mercy, thine
whole householde and family: whose God of mercy thou only art throughoute all
generations, and helper in all our needs and necessities: and haste appointed
therein by thy divine ordinance, temporal rulers, Princes and Magistrates, to
rule and govern thy people, according to equity and the rule of
righteousness, for the advancement of the good, and pumshmente of the evil:
and have also al their hearts in thine holy hand, to direct, sanctiste, and
govern them after thine own will to the godly example of others, and to set
forth (amongste them) thy glory: have mercy upon thy servant Elizabeth, our
noble and most gracious Queen, in the excellency of her most high calling,
holy service, and of great charge before thee in thy sanctified Church: that
as her heart (specially) being truly directed in thy sight by the spirit of
light and truth, to the true knowledge, perfect obedience, and ready
furtherance of thy will, with all christian diligence and seruencie, (as above
all things best behooves her most gracious and royal majesty: that the
rather in all other her necessities, she may at all times be most assuredly
blessed by thee, relieved, comforted, strengthened, mightily defended and
delivered both in body and soul:) so also, the honorable her beloved, grave,
and prudente Counselors, faithful ministers under her and whole family, may
every of them in their degree, christian vocation or faithful service,
duetifully way with them selves, the virtue of their charge, straight band
and profession before thee, seeking truly under her highness (for thy glory
and her honor) the fruteful knowledge of thy laws: that in their state of
great excellency, right worshipful calling, mean state, or inferioure
ministry, (whether of the Clergy, as they are termed, or of the laity)
they may have the fear and true obedience before their eyes, framing
unfeignedly all their affections, their actions and duties, by the only rule of
thy word of life: What it is to imitate christ.
walking uprightly therein, holily, and religiously, in thought, word, and
deed, with undefiled, pure and peaceable consciences, to the daily edifying,
encouraging and strengthening of all others: that thereby her whole Court or
Princely family, being through fullness of virtue and thine heavenly wisdom
wonderful to behold, woorthily noted of all, delighted in of all, and most
highly commended of al, may be of all most dearly beloved, highly esteemed,
joyfully received, thankefully used, practiced and followed, as a most precise
patron of all perfect and true piety: as a very brighte, large, and clear
shining light, deeply piercing, inwardly quickening, far extending and
reaching over al, or as a clear sountaine or quick springing water; descending
from an high, most beautiful to look on, most pleasant to taste on, very
dilectable, most necessary, helthfull and comfortable, common to all, swiftly
running toward all, and embraced of all, and into al parts, belonging to her
highness or round about her: whereby, through the purity, healthfulnesse,
clearness, cleanness, and fullness thereof, al her people (and others) drawing
to the^ selves, and tasting abundantly of ye same, may long be preserved,
healthfully norished, vpholde^ in vortue, in true religion and honesty, all
the days of their lives, that in stead of thy terrible judgments and
wrathful indignations due unto all, for disobedience, contempt and
sinfulness, thy most gracious and fatherly blessings (as sweet dews from
heaven) may always most comfortably, favorably with speed and abundantly,
light both upon her highness, upon her Nobilities whole Court and whole
Country, to thine only honor, praise and glory, even in the sight and faces
of all her and our ennemies: that they may plainly see it, may be ashamed of
their error, of their darkness, wilful madness, great disobedience, wicked
atte^ptes and contemptes, and may be more mindful of thee, thou great God of
righteousness, seek most gladly in truth to know thee, to fear thine holy
name, to be converted unto thee, and to bless with us in righteousness all the
days of their lives, through thy son Jesus Christ, and for his sake, our only
savior, our only mediatoure and advocate. Amen.

XI. Against vain hope and pride.
O Lord, that art only omnipotente, How we should for the great love of God,
lone him again.
mild and merciful, and the only perfect hope of thy beloved inheritance:
upon whom thy grace has most freely abounded, and whose sins thou haste
remitted, by the only oblation, sacrifice and blood shed of thy dear sorme
Christ Jesus: for which purchase and most precious redemption, thou only
requirest of them, but to be beloved again: and that with an upright
staysdnesse, an assured strength and true confidence only in thee: and not
otherwise vainly, in any vain man, or other treatures: and that they be not
hautie in their own eyes, but possess even in thy sight and in them selves,
the spirit of meekness, and of most lowly submission: we most entirely
beseech thee, to strengthen us herein with thine: heavenly grace, to stay us
unto thy self, and to make us humble in our own eyes: that imitating the
steps of thy son, we be not ashamed to bear in thy sight, the contempt of
this wretched world, and to become with all lowliness and mild subjection,
even very slaves to all others, for the loves sake of thy dear son Jesus:
whose rule of Humility we have most truly professed, and thereby promissed
to bear with patience, both poverty and all other afflictions in this vale
of wretched; nesse, where, when, and in what manner so ever it shall please
thee to lay them upon us.

O Lord, so uphold thou us with thine heavenly grace, that we stay not
simply upon our own selves, or put our trust in others: but flee fast
from our selves and from all others, and put our whole and only hope in thee:
endeavoring with all our powers (both of body and mind) to obey thy will,
and trust only in thee, that thou will always be the ready helper of our good
wills, and a most apt furtherer of all our honest meanings. Let thy
mercy (O Lord) so be upon us, that we be not vainly puffed up, or put
confidence either in our own knoweledge, or in the policy of any mortal
manne: but only depend upon thy Divine and fatherly providence, which both
helpest and geeuest thy grace to the humble, and thrustest also down the
lostie and proud. So temper us lord with thine heavenly grace, that we glory
neither in our richesse if we have them, nor yet in our friends if they be
mighty, (for thou most mighty God haste dominion over their power, and when
they are alofte, and exalted in their glory, thou throwest them down, abatest
their courage, and destroyest them with thy heavy hand:) but to glory (as we
ought) only in thee, which do freely minister unto us all things necessary,
and destrest above all, to give thine own self wholely unto us. Thou (O
Lord) haste led us the way to true humility: that whether touching either the
mightiness, Humility.
beauty or comeliness of the body (which being stricken with some light
disease, is by and by overthrown and defaced) we in no wise advance our
selves. And least we stand most vainly in our own conceits, whether for our
own towardness, wisdom, wit, or in other things, judge better of our own
selves tha^ we do of others, we greatly offend and fall into thine heavy
displeasure, and bring thy wrath upon us: because we esteem them not as
thine own proper gifts, and so be thankful unto thee for them. O grant
unto us therefore (most gracious God) thy spirit of meekness and true
humbleness, that we may walk rightly before thee, and have in our selves and
in thy sight, clean hearts, constantelaithe, and most sure hope and
considence: trauing continually thy spirit of romfort, patiently thereby to
bear our cross, to follow the example of our savior Christ, and to bear
with joy the afflictions of this life through his merits, precious death and
pastion. Amen.

XII. Against Covetousness.
IF we (O thou just and terrible God) could now through thy grace, even in
the midst of all our iniquities, heaping daily iniquitis upon iniquity,
remember yet in time, thy certain deter minatio^ and threaiued judgment upon
this world, God threatens the world for sin.
and the plages thereof shortly enstring for the wickedness of end (...)
heart: and as thou haste told: us by thy Prophet Esaias, to lay to (...), to
make the face of the whole earth desolate, and scatter abroad all the
inhabitoures thereof, because they have offended thy laws, changed thine
ordinalires; and made thine ever lasting testament of (...): receiving therefore
with we, their most sharp and bitter portion, the taste of thy divine fury,
utter shame, desolation and swift confusion: O what cause have we then to
remember in these our days (if through grace it might be for good) this most
vile sin abidng ye rest, the outrageous (...) covetousness, The Canker
covetousness how it reigns.
that so diuersty woorketh the disglory of thy name, and spoyleth thy churches
welfare? Which, in the estimation of this world so langely reigns, so
universally; so familiarly, yea, and also mercilesly: ouerfloweth al, deuoureth
al, has al at his beck, and hastneth fast upon this geiteration (an evil and
pitilesse generation doubtless, in the end now of this old rotten world) the
sudden and straight performance of thy hideous and fearful premises. O Lord
our God, most dangerous is our stats, our days are most evil, our deserts
are great, we have sinned grievously, thy plagues are justly prepared, and thy
judgments to condemnation, by thy justice are at hand upon us. For who in
effect ca^ say (from any sin) his heart is clean? or rather most mo^struously
against nature, not to be defiled? either who can in conscience say, that he
feels not in him self (as privately for him self and corruptly,) this most
hurtful and infectuous malady of the soul? which amongst, all other
contagious evils, is most perniceous, and by the devil him self deeply
grafted in us, and is by him so closely crept in unto us, that it has joined
it self, ever to the very secret affections of our hearts, showing it self a
most diligent woorker, Conetousnes how it works.
a busy labourer or minister, to the procuring, breeding, increasing,
norishing and bringing forth of corruption ruption and sins innumerable,
covertly lurking in our filthy flesh, and sowly to the death, issues abroad
in his time. For it is (as says thine holy Apostle) the root of all
mischief: and that all such also as are the Ravens and greedy Gripes or
gutlings of the world, and desirous of the deceiteful riches thereof, fall
without stay into temptations and snares, and into many beastly, foolish, and
noisome lusts, which draw them into temptation and destruction. Covetousness,
the woorshipping of Idols.
Also, he calls it, a woorshipping of idols: it spoileth God of his honor:
and is thereby in every place of the holy Scriptures condemned and forbidden, as
a sin most heinous, horrible, diuellishe and damnable: because it is a most
curssed and venomous evil, tied to ambition, hautie and vaineglorious, full of
maliciousness, full of cruelty, very tirannous, and greeoely hunteth after
blood: the deep set seed doutlesse of the devil, who was a murderer from
the beginning, and has therewith by his subteltie, Covetousness he we it
has prevailed.
maruellously prevailed upon the earth, and brought into subjection, not only
the most unfaithful, very reiectes, and wicked cast awayes from thy favor,
(who being but earthly, set their whole felicity upon earthly things) but
even the very professors also of thy most holy and blessed religion. For in
all estates and degrees, from the most to the least, from the highest to the
lowest, all are defiled therewith, al bend their wits most gracelesly and
inordinately to insatiable covetousness, exceeding far the limits of
necessity, scraping and gathering together, as the children of diffidence and
very worldlings, Children of diffidence.
contrary to the law of nature, contrary to the law of charity, or christen
holiness and purity, whether by right or by wrong, by hook, by crook, by
extortion, by oppression, by flattery, by perjury, sorcery, usury, bribery,
simony, privy co^spiracy against town, city, prince and the whole country:
greedy of vengeance, yea, by what means so ever it be, and often by most wilful
consent to murder, whether of others, or through indigence, lack of
sufficiency, or by some sinister stroke of fortune, desperately destroy
themselves. Such are our wills to wickedness (o lord) yt being void of thy
grace, we sink deeply into al abomination, and are altogether without
moderation or stay of our appetites affectionately grubbing for more and more,
til death cut us short, till our mouths be filled with grauel, Abac. 2.
or til we heap up (as the Prophet says) thick clay against our selves,
feling the justice of the rightuous god, from whom we are fled, and have put
our only affiaunce, in wicked and vain filthy Mammon. To the end therefore (O
most loving God) we may in thee be better staide, our lives in thy fear more
aptly framed, and our faulty faithes more christianly reformed, grant that
by thy word we may truly know thee, obey thy will, put our only trust in thee,
love thee, as our god of mercy, and reverence thee as our Lord of justice.
Grant unto us the influence of thine heavenly grace, that our graceless,
indurate, and most barraine hearts, being thus bewitched and hardened by the
devil, may he by thee most graciously reformed, frutefully tempered, deeply
endued, thoroughly softened, sown with thy celestial seeds, well harrowed
rowed and made truly profitable, that thy holy Church, may thereby be speedely
purged of this very present and most pestilent infection, now reigning with
outrage over all the world. Whereof, because our lives stands not in the
abundance of these vanities which we here possess, thy son Christ left
straighte charge unto us (the professoures of his name) in any wise to beware
of Covetousness. Root out therefore we pray thee (O God) from our hearts,
our insatiable and greedy desires. O incline our hearts unto thy
testimonies, and not to couetousenesse: but yielding to thy will with contented
minds in our calling, we may in all our necessities, cast gladly our cares
upon thy back that art truly rich, almighty, a ready helper, very mindeful
and merciful unto us, for our sufficient relieuement, and to further thereby
thy glory. Prepare us to be charitable, free hearted and liberal, to have in us
the bowels of compassion, to be pitiful always to the poor, to yield to
sufficiency, too neither riches nor poverty, to remember we nakedly entered
this world, that we shall carry nothing out of this world, that we must
forsake the world, for it will forsake us, away needs we must, we are here
but strangers, our years are but few, our calling sudden, death tarieth not,
death spares not, death aresteth, our reckening must be made, our judge is
just, our witness is true, our sentence is determined, our place appointed,
our reward prepared, and most preciously purchased (O heavenly father) for
thine holy elect and obedient children, by the only death and blood shed of
thy son our dear Lord and savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

XIII. Against Adultrie and Whoredom.
Forasmuch (O eternal God) as thou only art most rightuous, pure, holy, and
undefiled, and abhorrest from thine heart, the stinking sin of lust, adultry,
whoredom, fornication and such like: and requirest also of us in the.vij.
precept, that in our lives and conversation we be like unto thee in all purity
and holiness, and in any wise not to defile or once spot our selves, with the
attempts of unlawful lusts or wantonness: Constancy in chastity.
but constantly hold and keep fast, the integrity of our faithful promise
made unto thee our only Lord God, both in the calling of our sole lives,
Sole life.
and in the holy state also of matrimony (which in the sight of thee, is very
honorable, of high perfection, and great excellency) and is amongste men in
thy holy Church, Matrimony a fountain in Gods church.
as it were the lovely fountain or well spring of good life, not only in the
beautifying of them selves through their own clerenesse in chastity, but
flows forth also (by example and doctrine) with most sweet taste to their
own beloved offspring and family, and to the apt seasoning likewise of the
single and unmarried sort: we most humblye beseech thee to take from us in our
weakness and frailty, the violent power of flesh and blood, and to quench
in us continually, The corruption of flesh and blood.
the raging lusts of our unclean and sinful bodies: which inwardly moves
violently stirs, strives, wounds, inflameth, burns, alters sore the
body, amaseth the mind, spoileth the senses, makes men mad, or turns the
unwise of the world quite beside their wits. O God, that art maker of all
makind, thou see all things, thou beholdest al our doings, thou know the
affections of our hearts, and how by nature, we are naturally inclined to
such evil, and given to feel in our weakness, the smarts of our
infections, boiling and soming fumes of the fickle and frail flesh, The power
of flesh and blud, and what they work.
and stirred daily thereby to great abominations and filthiness, to hasten
upon our selves, the heat of thy furious and fierce vengeance, because we have
vowed, as thou haste commanded, such evils to be eschued, and none adultery
or the syke uncleanness to be commicted: for as thou (O Lordo) haste called us,
so have we yielded to thy call, and promised thee, to walk before thee in
purity and holyuesse of life, being made of many members, one body and one
spirit with thee: and therefore from the heart to abhor all uncleanness, and
not to be defiled and made the members of an harlot: for we know, that no
fornicator, filthy adulteror, whoremonger, abuser of himself with mankind, no
unclean person nor weakeling, shall inherit thine heavenly kingdom, O father
of all merey and grace, let not the desues then of such corruption and
vurlenlinesse, faston their root of death upon us, neither to be given over
to an unshamefast and obstinate mind, flying from thy holy will in our
profession, contemning the act ^^table countels of the godly or also neglecte
the terrible examples of thy justice a written for our learning, The pumishe
ments of God for uncleanness of lyse.
and to print with faith in memone, that for such abomination and
wickedness, thou haste plaged the ear the: The old world was drouned, the
Sodomites, the rest of the.v. Cities, and their whole country, with fiery
flames, sulpher and Brimstone from heaven were destroyed: with such other like
the terror of thy vengeance, by sharp plages and punishments upon others,
clearly mentioned in thy holy scriptures, plainly approved in other histories,
and daily both known and felt amongst us. O most gracious and loving father,
create therefore in us we beseech thee, hunble, contrite and clean hearts, renew
within our bowels right spirits, and turn all voluptuousness away from us,
that neither in thought, word, nor deed, we willingly offend the sight of thy
majesty. And grant that whether we live vnmattried, or in the holy state of
Matrimony, we may lead our lives in purity, true holiness and chastity.

And when at any time we feel in our selves to be assalted with temtation, or
stirred by evil lust to commit obhomination, we may then have strength of thy
grace to set before our eyes, thy justice, the reward of sin, the terror
of death, the day and end of this life, the gnawing worm of our conscience,
thy terrible doom, the challenge of the Devil, the everlasting torments, and
the horrible pains of hell. And that we living in our christian calling and
holy profession, in all purity hothe of body and soul all the days of our
lives, we may receive in the end the reward of everlasting felicity, and see
thee face to face in thine eternal and most glorious kingdom, through thy
son Jesus Christ. Amen.

XIIII. A Prayer against swearing and blasphemy.
WHen we (O holy and eternal God) have in remembrance (as we be charged) thy
precise will and commandments, given generally unto us all, and binding us
all from evil: namely among the rest, not to take ye name of thee our god in
vain, nor in any wise to abuse it, To be a blasphemer of Gods name, is rather
the property of an ethnik than a Christian.
as does the wicked Ethuieke, (yt knows not thy name) irreligiously, vainly
and falsoly: but at all times to, consider well: of it, highly to extol it,
and have it in dureuerence, as behooneth the faithful lovers and professors of
the same, least we be (...) of thee accurssed and guilty, and sustain as thou
have threatened, thy most just and sharp revenge: we are here greatly
occasioned to consider our present and most dangerous state, how imperfect,
wretched and dampnable it is in thy sight, through our deadly fall from thy
will in this holy precept, and are now driven cyther to seek remedy at thine
only merciful hand, or to perish in hell eternally: we beseethe thee most
humbly (O thou God of all grace) that as thou beholdest in us, the error of
our lives, and our corrupted inclination to all sin and vanity, The error
of our lives.
contrary to the prescripte rule of thy holy law, and to seek thereby (as
much as ut us lies) the disglory of thy name, and to work our own shame and
utter confusiou: so to grant now unto us, that our souls in their
vnclenlinesse, horriblenesse and blasphemous state, may be truly purged of al
infectio^s, The power of Gods word.
deadly darkness, wilful malice, and ignorance, and the sights of them
refreshed, quickened, made lively and perfect, by the bright light and true
faith in thy holy word, yt they may clearly and comfortably see, know, and
behold ye true glory of thy majesty, and thereby also inwardly feel the
sweet promises of thine heavenly grace, the free pardone also of all our
sins, and the receiving of us into thy grace and favor, not for any thing at
all in our selves, but for thy son Christ Jesus sake: through which only
mercy and great goodness granted unto us in him, thou art, and of right
ever ought to be only estomed of us, only praised, magnified, and highly
reverenced, The mercy of God in Christ.
as thy name (in heaven and in earth) most condignely of all requires: which
is from us, even so much in every respect, as we in deed truly know thee in
thy son Christ: by whom only and through grace in him, we are stirred most
woorthily to extol thy most glorious and holy name: but not so lightly by
custom to profane it, and irreverently abuse it: whether by cruel
blasphemy, contempt of thine heavenly word, true religion and doctrine, or
otherwise in our sinful conversation, or evil manner of living. Take us
therefore we pray thee to thy mercy (O Lord) and that soon, for great is our
sin and iniquity, in this accustomed sin of blasphemy. O set thy fear
speedely before our eyes, and shut not up from us the knowledge of thy truth,
The inconue niece that follows the want of Gods word.
our director to righteousness: but kindle inwardly into our souls, the
light thereof: least in the deadly darkness, pride and great peruersitie of
our wicked hearts, we do daily degenerate, turn from our profession, fall
willingly from thee, become ungrateful, vain, proud and high minded,
contumelious and spiteful, shameless, open enemies, and very blasphemous
against thee, as the only possessors of the devil, and falling like
reprobates, from iniquity to iniquity. Who, for their horrible abuses sake
and profanation of thy name, how they shall be woorthily plaged (thine hand
of justice not being shortened) is plainly evident in thy most sacred and
heavenly word of truth. For thou thy self haste said: that what so ever he
be that is a blasphemer, and uses thy name vainly and unprofitably, The
punish ments and plages of God for taking his name in vain.
shall not escape thy scurges and punishments. And in an other place it is also
written: that who so ever uses much to swear, shall be filled with curssings
and iniquity: and the plage, which is the just bengeance of thy wrath, shall
never depart from his house, but shall in time consume it, and all the
inhabitants thereof. Again, we read out of thy Prophet Zachary, that thou
shewedst unto him flying in the air, a marvelous large and a great book,
even.xx. cubits in length, and.x. in breadth, wherein was contained ye horrible
plages that are prepared for all the^ which contemptuously, maliciously,
vainly, falsely, or rashely, swear by thy blessed and holy name. O Lord of
infinite mercies, and long suffering God, that art to be blessed for ever,
whose mercyes reaches unto the heavens: The necessity of Gods mercy.
if thou in these our days of great abomination, curssed blaspheming, and
taking thy holy name in vain, so carelessy, usually, and by custom for every
small trifle, bisides other deadly and dampnable sins daily committed amongst
us, should in the judgment of thine own cause, flersly rise up against
us, or as thy Prophet David says, extreemely mark what is done amiss, O Lord
how should we abide it? How should we (most sinful wretches) in these days,
abide the terror of thy vengeance, that by thy justice hangs over us, or
should in a moment consume us all like stubble. But thou rewardest us not
according to our sins, thy mercy endures for ever, and therefore to avoid
the terror of thy justice, due unto us most disobedient sinners, we appeal to
the deep fountains of thy mercy, Suit for mercy.
humbling our selves before thy mercies seat, with penitent hearts, for the
remission of our sins, and that you wilt not impute the^ now unto us, but for
the glory of thy name, to mollify, to cleanse, and always to keep clean,
our hard, stony and evil stuffed hearts, with the deep piercing deawe of
thine heavenly grace: that where all those terrible punishments and most
grievous plagues before mentioned, are already devised, prepared, threatened,
and at an instant appointed to fall upon us: we may yet by thy mercy escape
them, extol thee in thine unspeakable goodness, The sanctifying of Gods holy
name.
and magnify thine holy name, from our hearts, and with our tongs and voices,
and fear to profane or abuse it: no, neither yet thy creatures in heaven or
in earth: but most humbly with all ioyfulnesse to attend to thy sons most holy
precept: which is, not to swear at all by any thing, but in our communication
to use, yea yea, nay nay, even from heart and mouth simply, truly, and without
dissimulation: and to pass forth our lives and conversation in our calling,
reverently, sincerely, and incorruptly, as becomes faithful and unfeigned
Christians, the true lovers and professoures of thine only holy name, which is
to be blessed for ever. Amen.

XV. For the possessyng of a peaceable and quiet conscience.
Seeing thy kingdom (O GOD) as thou say, is within us, and that it behooves
as thou haste taught us, to have outward things of this world, and the world it
self in contempt, and to embrace only with good affecte, all inward things,
to the beautifying of the inward man, whereby we shall the more aptly feel in
deed, thine holy kingdom to come into us: which kingdom is thine, most high,
most glorious, The kingdom of heaven.
holy, eternal and everlasting, a kingdom of joy and peace in the holy ghost:
whereof, the wicked has no part in possession, but only thine holy elect
and precious redeemed inheritance. Grant unto us all we humbly pray thee,
such love toward thee, and thine heavenly kingdom, that for thy sake, and
for the love thereof, we may co^tenine our selves, esteem but light of this
life, and set all this world at naught. And being lifted up in spirit above
our selves, and void of all inordinate desires, excelling in our lives in
all heavenly virtues, and be such in deed inwardly, as we seem to the world
outwardly, our souls may be made fit habitacles to enjoy thy glorious presence
with most happy felicity, extolling thy grace, glorying in the works of true
holiness, A quiet conscience.
and in the testimony of a peaceable and quiette conscience, which is in all
men a secret knowledge, The nature of a man's conscience.
a privy opener, inward accuser, a joyful quieter of their minds in all
their doings, and a witness bearer of the truth, even unto the presence and
precise judgment of thee our God.

O grant therefore unto us (most gracious God) so to be directed by thy holy
spirit, that our consciences may be unto us unstained and pure, even as a
very perfect and clear glass, speedely to be looked into, and plainly to
see in time, with a true and perfect sight, not only the most filthy foul
spots and enormious blemishes of our sinful and sick souls, but also
the very smallest or beginnings of diseases, by soon quick touch or sharp
prick of remorse, whereby fear may be conceived of imminet danger, and by
humble suit to flee fast unto thee the most ready, perfect and heavenly
Physician, that we may be soon salued with the ointment of thy divine grace:
Wicked consciences.
and not to be as the wicked, whose consciences are most deeply corrupted,
inwardly rankeled, dead and benumbed, through carelessness and the custom of
sin: that they cannot once feel, see, nor perceive, their own most loathsome
sickness and deformity of soul: until thou (O God) by the stroke of thy
deadly darte, layest them open before their faces, to their own confusion,
sudden and swifte destruction: and so their consciences being now found most
deeply wounded, and the worm thereof terribly gnawing, biting and accusing
them, they fall most damnably into desperation, without regard of thy majesty,
or any hope at all of thy tender mercy. O heavenly father, and the only
fountain of all grace, turn thy face from our sins, deliver us from thy
wrathful indignation, and so strengthen us by the power and light of thine
eternal spirit, that we may be trained to the true knowledge and perfect
obedience of thy will: that we may in all our doings, remember our profession
and promise, possess firm faith, which truly quieteth and sets at rest
the conscience of man, fear thy judgments, live uprightly and worthily
before thee, glory in the testimony of a good conscience, sprinkled and
cleansed with the blood of thy son Christ, The con modity of a quiet
conscience.
enjoy peace and true gladness, not troubled inwardly, but sleep quietly, not
glorying in the praises of men, but rejoice only in thee our God, in thy mercy
and grace, in thy holy truth, in the price of our redemption, and in the
only most happy state of eternal felicity, which thou haste faithfully
promised, which thy son has purchased, which unto us shall be performed,
most happily and in due time, through thine only free grace and love toward
us, in the precious death and blood shed of thine only son our alone
savior, only advocate and mediator Jesus Christ. Amen.

XVI. To have in remembrance the hour of death.
CAlling to mind (O eternal god) the fickle state of humain felicity, Man's
life fickle, and but a vain shadow.
and the swifte passage of this brickle life, how man stands here in a vain
shadow, freshly flourishing like a flower to day, and can to morrow no where be
found, and as quickly forgotten as he is gone: and yields then up by the
dint of death, his swifte passage to God or to the Devil: O how it behooves
us to startle suddenly, to bestirre us, to look about us, and to prepare
speedely for so sudden assault? But how shall we Lord, standing in deed in
such infelicitie, The damnable state of mankind in this frail life.
slumbring in such security, so infected with frailetie, so compassed with
flattery, cloked in hipoerisie, and overwhelmed with vanity, neither yet
feel in our selves any fight or trouble of conscience, prepare us as we
ought, for so conueniente a time? Thou know (O Lord) as by thy wrath we
justly also feel, how sedainly unawares, death cruelly assaileth us, and
strippeth us from our pleasures, vain delectations and delusious of this
deceitful world. We regard nothing at all, the sudden coming of the son
of man: by whose mighty arm (in our forgot fullness) we he woorthily stricken
to the death, and to our mother the earth again: in whose entrails we were
once brod; and out of whose most ponsoned pappes, we have sucked the milk, of
all our deadly delites: and with the brusting draught of our most beastly
excess, we have suddenly overthrown our selves, and have very willingly
fallen, upon thy merciless swoorde of death. Through which judgment, wort and
terrible time, In what case we shall stand at the hour of death.
we shall begin then to think (with late wailing and woe) far otherwise of our
formen lives, than we did before in the lulling days of our carnal delices:
we shall then conswer the greatness and granitie of, all our affences, and be
depely tormonted in insufferable anguishes, (...) forowes, yelling,
lauguistying and the auinosse, for our careless and most graceless
negligence: because (...) our health and tune of felicity, we (...) forgetful
of thee, us we caued not to te^pte thee, we feared not thy threatened vengeance,
neither thy Preachers and Prophets, we were unmindful of the end, we
considered not the way of all flesh, we remembered not death, neither readily
prepared for his sudden coming: The black enfine of death displayed.
whose ensign by thy justice, is openly all black displayed, most ougly
issuing out of his dark sepulcher, to the speedy destruction of all flesh.
Therefore (O Lord) as our lives are wholely in. thine only hand, and are by
thee (when we call upon thee) most graciously directed: quicken our hearts to
prayer, endue us through thy grace, with thine heavenly wisdom, teach us
thereby to number our days, to apply our hearts unto wisdom, to be
mindful of thee our God, not to be forgetful of our wretched and wicked
state, and to remember always thy rightful justice in judgment: that we may
endeavor to be such in deed in our lives, as we would wish most gladly to
be found at our deaths. O heavenly father, so strengthen us with thy usual
and woonted grace, that as we may have this world in most earnest contempt:
so we may also as effectually crave at thine holy hand, the daily prospering
and going forwards in virtue: pray, that our love may abound toward godly
discipline for the form of good living: Discipline works the form of good
living.
yield freely forth the fruits of earnest and true repentance: have ready and
pressed wills to show true obedience both in body and soul: to be humble and
meek in spirit: not to stay at any time the denial of our selves: to
subject our selves to thy holy will and commandments: and so to lean gladly
to the suffering of this worlds calamities: not for our selves, but for the
love of Jesus Christ, and for our brethren (for so shall we be known to be the
children of God.) All which, if we happily possess, use, and put in daily
practice: The sweet fruits of good life against the coming of death.
great shall be the cause of our joy, to have good affiaunce in thy mercy, a
sweet taste of good life, and a sure hope by happy death: becoming in the
mean while, parient Pilgrims in spiritual poverty, and not regarding the
pleasures of this life: that our souls may possess the felicity of thy
freedom: be daily lifted up unto thee in this our short race: that we may
continually pray, with sorrowful sighings, deep sobbings, inward gronings,
and shedding salt tears in our accustomed and most humble suits, bewayling
our miserable state, mourning the delay of this bodies dissolution, and yield
with patience to abide the stroke of death, that when it, which is the last
enemy, shall be destroyed, Paciente abiding of death, brings the soul to
rest.
our spirits may have rest in thine eternal life: therow the only merits of
thy son, our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.

XVII. To have in remembrance the secret judgments of God, and to fear the
withdrawing of his grace.
Having good experyence by thine holy scriptures (O thou rightuous God) that as
thou art most high, most glorious, most holy, The majesty and great power of
God over al flesh.
wise and mighty, and a great God above all Gods, eternal, and from
everlasting: so art thou also a Lord, a ruler, a master, an ouerscer and a
judge over all the doings of men, yea, a severe judge, a straighte examiner,
an upright and just rewarder: against whom, no man may once rowse or advance
him self, stand in his own conceit, or show before thee any proud or
hautie countinance: for it is thou only (O Lord) that art omnipotent, whose
mighty arm reaches over all: which aduancest and bring low, which strykest
and healest, which woundest and make whole, which liftest up and throwest
down again, which dealest in thy judgment, not after the manner of men,
wickedly winking at the sins, generally committed of all, or of a few: but
use uprightness unto all without respect of persons: generally,
particularly, to many, to a few, and to some one alone, when their sins
before thee are full, and waxes ripe unto judgment, apt to fall, and ready to
feel from thy wrathful hand, the sudden stroke of thy vengeance: for
vengeance (annexed to thy power) is only thine and thy just reward: God a God
of vengeance.
whose judgments for sin, are very terrible, fierce, a flaming and
consuming fire, to lick up, catch, burn and deuonre, all or some, as the
cause shall require, and as by thy justice in judgment thou finedest the^ (for
so in all ages, we have both truly heard and known) which examples of thine
(in sundry wise) are all written for our understanding and learning, Gods
judgments are to be remebred, and why.
always to be remembered of us, to put us in good mind, to terrify us, to
bridle our affections, to fear thy majesty, to seek the true knowledge of
thy will, reverently therein to obey thee, and to escape aptly thereby thy just
rigor and vengeance, for vengeance is thine, and you wilt reward, O holy and
just god, which also artmost gracious, which sparest when we deserve
punishment, in thy wrath think upon mercy, and haste vowed compassion upon
the poor penitent, have mercy upon me most wretched sinner: O forgeeue me
all my wickedness past, let thy tender mercy prevent my sins, cast them al
behind thy back, and show me again thy comfortable countinance: for my
sins sore trouble me, they justly accuse me, thy judgments terribly thunder
against me, they sore shake my limbs with fear and trembling, and terrify
out of measure, my sore vexed and contrite heart. And if by thine heavenly
motion (O Lord) I yet wade further in thy judgments, and consider the very
heavens, Gods judgments are terable and thu^ dring.
not to be clean in thy sight, but expecte the day of their renouation, for
further cleerenesse and purity: O how am I occasioned to be the more amazed,
and to bewail my wretched state, in the lothsomnesse of my corruption. The
heavens, the Angels, the^ selves, and the stars fallen from heaven, are all
subject to the judgments of god.
And if in the Angels them selves thou haste found sin, and the desert of
eternal death, and therefore not spared thy judgments over them, O what shall
become of me, earthie, frail, and most sinful wretch? And if also the
glorious stars themselves, have in the excellency of their outward
clearenesse and beauty, fallen down from heaven, and abide likewise thy
judgment: what shall I a mass of darkness, stime and filthe of the earth,
look for at thy wrathful hand, having my very secret sins not hid from
thee, in their most horrible, loathsome, and poisoned apperance? But yet I
beseech thee (O heavenly father) although you be a straighte judge over all
thy creatures for sin, whether of heaven or of earth, celestial, terrestrial
or infernal, subject to thy will, and to abide justly thy judgment: for
thine approved clemencies sake, and tender pity toward me, imprinted still
fresh in my memory, and boldened thereby to approach thy presence, so to
exte^d upon me thy great mercy and grace, that as I now crave the continual
good motion and inward stirring up of my mind by thine holy spirit, to remember
always the burden of my sin, and to fear the terror of thy judgments, for
due punishing of the same: so I make unto thee most humble suit, not to be
destitute of a lively faith, true trust and confidence in thy mercy and grace,
that thou will humble my soul before thee, prepare in me a clean heart, and a
will inclineable to thy testimonies: that how so ever by thy will and justice,
I feel in this world for good thy private judgments, to the purging,
repressing, and keeping under, my stubburne and proud flesh: God at the last
day by his just judgment, rendereth full payment unto all wicked sinners.
at the general judgment day, and in the world to come, that when al works
good and bad, shall be reduced to memory, and when a straight account and
reckening shall be made, and a just reward given, celestial or infernal both
to body and soul. I may yet escape the fullness of thy paime^t due for ever to
the wicked, by their deadly and just deserte. Hear me (O my God of all
mercy) and take thou care over me this day, most graciously direct me,
confirm and strengthen me in thy ways, least in mine own respect I be
found but feeble, and weak, slipping, full of inconstancy, unclean and too
too filthy: for there is no will, no power, nor holiness that avails, no
wisdom, no temperaunce, humility, love, dilygence, chastity, or mine own
keeping to good effect, without the free direction of thine holy hand, daily
government, most gracious preservation, God freely by his grace dyrecteth to
good life.
defending and holy watching. All which, as they proceed only from thee, and
are of thy mere mercy bestowed most bountifully upon me: so grant me grace,
(yea the continuance of thy grace) not to be forgetful of thee, but always to
remember thee with all humility and tha^kfulnesse, euch from the very depth and
bottom of mine heart and soul, all the days of my life, and have thenceforth
the reward of eternal felicity: through thy mercy, and the only merits of
thy son and my Savior Jesus. Amen.

XVIII. The Flighte of the faithful Soul to Christ, in the exuemitie of
temptations, and inward affections of the mind.
IF I, in presenting my self before thee (O sweet Jesus my Lord and only
savior) shall seem by thy gracious permission, some thing to say unto thee,
with heaviness of heart for my sins, which are infinite most damnable by
instice in thy sight, and most plainly also prove by thy word of truth, that
thou art yet bound to be favorable unto me: bound to cast all my sins
behind thy back: bound to bestow thy good graces, thy blessings and
benesites upon me: yea, and bound also in time, to give unto me thine heavenly
and celestial Paradise: I will not do it rashly before thee (my Lord and my
God) upon presumption, or co^temptuously, or for that I bear not a due and
worthy reverence unto the glory of thy divine majesty: neither mean I thereby
(in any thing) to diminish the excellency of thine heavenly power: but rather
to magnify and extol thine only omnipotency and great goodness, and to
stir up my self (even with all humility) to consider in part, the dear
love that thou bear toward me thy most evil and unprofitable servant. O
my sweet Jesus, Christ is challenged, and why?
bear now with me therefore, and first of all remember I beseech thee, thy
perfect knowledge heerin, that thine eterns and most merciful father, did
send thee into this world and vale of great misery, to the end thou should
save me, comfort me in my distress, strengthen me, defend and deliver me
most wretched sinner, in all anguishes, troubles, temptations and miseries,
both of body and soul, and that my sins should not prevail against me,
when I humbly pray and crave thy mercy. Christ's obedience to his father, for
his flock.
Thou (O merciful and loving Lord and savior) was obedient to the will of
thine heavenly father, like a most lowly and mild child: and for the love sake
also which thou had to thy flock, like a most dear loving pastoure,
did offer thy self to die, even the most cruel and shameful death upon
the cross. And also, if in case I did at any time make resistaunce,
rebelliously and wickedly to disobey, to straggle, or stray abroad when thou
calledste unto me, tourning the deaf ear, would not heart thee: he
straightely charged thee, and gave express Commandment unto thee also, that
thou should constrain and compel me home again to the fold: and to be also
his beloved ghest in his heavenly kingdom, at the joyful day of thy marriage.
The cause of christ's death.
O Christ, for this only good purpose, was thou borne unto us: for this cause
didste thou humble thy self among us: and for this most happy end, did thy
father so plentifully enrich thee, and even filled thee with the abundance of
his good gifts and treasures. Therefore, O my merciful Lord Jesus, remember I
pray thee thy tharge, see thou be mindful of thy good and most holy office:
and yield herein to the obedience of thy fathers will, as thou art bound and
woonte to do. The bond of the wealthy in this world
Thou know (O Lord) that all good and just laws, bind those that be rich
and wealthy in this world, to distribute part of their substance, to the
relieuement of poor and needy persons: yea, and the richer they be of the
good gifts of God, and in the greater miseries they find their poor and needy
neighbors, the more are they bound gladly to help and succoure them. Christ
abounds in heavenly riches, chatitie, power, and loyes in comparable.
This I say lord, because I acknowledge thee to be most rich, and of most
excellent power, abounding far above all others, in all joys and treasures
incomparable: where I contrariwise, am in great sorrow and heaviness of heart,
The distressed loule.
oppressed with all care and misery, and with extreme poverty and necessity
both of body and soul. Wherefore (O Lord) I humbly make suit unto thee, Christ
humbly challenged.
and challenge thee to be my speedy helper, for that I know thee to be most
ready, most willing, most able, and most bound to comfort me. And though I
have most grievously offended the eyes of thy majesty, yet because thou art
merciful (and I appealing to thy mercy) thou can not set thy self against
me, Christ bound to help, and why.
or withholde thy compassion from me, but art rather bound with all good
incoragement speedily to help and succor me. And why Lord should I say this?
truly for this cause, the greter (in the excellency of thy holy state) thou
do approuedly find thy self above all other: so much the more art thou
subject and obedient to the indispensable law of charity, and to be therefore
most merciful unto me: and to be obedient thereunto, is the greatest and most
porfecte soueraintie, thou should not be that Christ of God, unless thou
did gladly participate thy dear love to thy brethren. Yea, I say moreover
thou art so much the rather bound to love me, for that thou art mine head, and
I the meaner part and me^ver of thy body. Neither may thou say, thou can
not help me: Christ the head and cow fo^^er of his members.
for although with the flowing fou^taynes of thy grace, thou have bou^tifully
enriched all the Saints that ever were from the beginning: yet notwithstanding

there remains store abundauntly for me, Store remains of Gods grace.
and for all penitent sinners. No no Lord, thou have treasures yet
superfluous, which shall endure for ever: and wilt not thou aid and comfort me
thy poor and wretched creature with the crumbs that fall from thy table, for my
most joyful refection seeing me now in danger and irke to perish? The assured
faith of the thirsten soul.
Shat I think (O Lord) thy compassion so sle^der and so far from me, that I
shall doubt to be refreshed at thy gracious hand? No, God forbid, I will never
think so evil or slenderly of thee, but rather believe, that as thou art
able, so thou will in deed help me, and am thoroughly persuaded why. Am not I
(sweet Jesus) one of thy precious redeemed Iewelles? And have thou not spent,
Faith in Christ's blood.
even thy most precious heart blood for me, suffering for my sake, so many and
so extreme pains and most grievous torments? Yea, and haste thou not given
thine own dear life and soul, to purchase me unto thy self, and to live
with thee in thy fathers kingdom. And now to relieve or recover me out of
danger, should thou show thy self so unkind unto me, that I can not be
partaker of thy superfluous store, thine overplus and thine offalles? Thy
father did so plentifully enriche thee, with so many his worthy graces, to the
end, thou (O Lord) should behold in this world the sickness and great
necessities of thy troubled flock, and largely again to distribute unto the^
in their poverty, and to ease them also of their painfulness and infirmity.
And because (O my Lord and savior) I yield and humbly confess me, to be one
of those poor, miserable, and scabbed sheep: and acknowledge thee also, the
only bountiful, Scabde sheep.
good and free physician: I come therefore boldly, and say thus unto thee:
Christ the physician.
O Christ Jesus, as thy merciful father has freely given thee unto me, with
the fullness of thine incomparable and heavenly treasures, for my ready health,
wealth and strength both of body and soul: so I now flee unto thee, most
toyfully embrasing thee, and in such wise trust in thy mercy, that thou shall
too too much wrong me, if thou stoc from me or forsake me. Yea Lord, I say
unto thee, in consideration hereof, thou ought not, neither can thou
abanbon or cast me out from thee, but retain and embrace me, for my most
joyful and saving health. O Lord Jesus, suffer me yet a little to question with
thee: Was not thou the very same man, Christ humbly challenged.
the same Lord, savior and god, which by favor, having enriched thine holy
Apostles, gave them also in charge, that they should communicate, deal and
divide to others such spiritual riches and heavenly treasures, as thou before
had given unto them. Should, I judge of thee that give commandment to
others in doing good things, that thou thy self will not perform the same?
O Lord, as thou art a god of mercy and truth, and delightest of all men to be
truly so noted, were it possible for thee to alter one jot of thy purity, most
perfect and beautiful clerenesse of thy godly and divine nature, whereby one
sheep of thy flock should quayle or find any light occasion of offense? O
Jesus, as you art righteous, so art not thou a stu^bling block unto the righ
teous. Strong faith in Christ.
And truly my soul trusts in thee: it mou^teth up into the heavens before
thee, and my faith is lively toward thee. O perform therefore faithfully
toward me (as thou art faithful) ye which thou did so justly command unto
thine Apostles and to us. Thou certainly do know that thine heavenly father
(at the beginning) filled thee withal virtues, stuffed thee with all tresures,
poured his graces upon thee with all plentifulnesse: to the end that in this
world thou should not bend nor set thy mind, properly to possess and gather
treasure for thine own self: but that thou should altogether, turn and
apply thine endeavor, to see me and the rest of thy poor brethren comforted,
safely nourished, kept, strengthened and defended in all assayes. And so thou
haste done hitherto, Romans 15.
as S. Paul bears us in hand: for all that thou have pretended, wrought and
suffered from the beginning, Chrysts incarnation, nativity, and so forth, are
al challenged of the faithful soul as his own.
was for me, for thine, and my brethrens sake. Thine holy incarnation
therefore, thy nativity and circumcision, thy baptism, thy fasting and
praying, thy temptations, thy watchings, thy preachings, thy painful
trauellings and dangers, thy shameless accusatio^s, spittings and raylings,
thy bloody sweat, thy woeful and bitter tears, thy cruel and traitorous
apprehension, thy cross and most painful passion, thy blood shed, thy life,
thy death, thy burial, thy resurrection, yea and thy most glorious ascension,
into everlasting life, and all the rest which thou haste done, felt, and
suffered, was all for me, they are all mine, and I now challenge them all at
thine hand, as mine own. Al thy divine treasures are mine: yea, and even thou
thy self art wholely also mine, Romans 8.
Thy father has given thee unto me, and thou also was contented that I should
possess thee, and therefore thou can not now deny thy self to be mine.
Math. 20.
Thou came into this world to take pains for me, and to serve me: and doste
thou not know, that what so ever the servant gets by his travail, he
gains it, not for him self, Christ a servant.
but for the use of him whom he serves. Thou did like a puissant Prince,
triumphantly fight for me, Christ a conqueror.
by waging and winning battle: and therefore the treasures and spoils, the
triumphs and victories, which thou then did get, are altogether mine. It is
not now of late O Jesus, (thou most victorious and noble Prince) since thou, as
with whom were only left these great and precious treasures: and haste thou
now bestowed them all? I will not say thine, but my treasures: wherewith thou
have purchased for me a most pleasant place of rest, even the joyful and
heavenly Paradise? Paradise purchased by Christ.
yea, thou haste also taken possession of it for me: and should thou now go
about to dispossess me of mine own, and to deprive me of mine inheritance
and right? No Lord no, there is in me no possibility at all to believe that:
Experience of Christ's good nature, and his mercy.
for I have (in such wise) both heard, felt, and known, diversely and
innumerable ways, of thy gracious good nature, and of thy perfect charity
and truth, that I must needs confess thy great goodness and liberality
toward me, and so to trust truly in thee. Thou have diligently sought for
me, thou haste offered thy self unto me, thou have so many ways called unto
me, and so diverse and sundry ways allured me to come to thy most royal and
magnificent marriage, promising to accept me, for thy dear beloved gheast:
Math. xj. xxij.
therefore, I am most certainly persuaded and fully assured, not to be
deceived of thee. And thou have said: he that comes to thee, John. 6
thou will not cast him out.

And now that I most gladly and willingly yield unto thee, and of, good
heart come toward thee, will thou turn thy face away from me, and not cheer
me with thy comfortable and sweet countenance? As I am constrained, and by thy
sweet allurementes persuaded, or rather enforced (beholding mine own
imperfection) to come unto thee, that art altogether perfect: even so art
thou (by thy large promises) bound to accept me. Thou did say: Ioho. 12.
If I shall once be exalted, I will then braw all things unto me. Thine
exaltation upon the cross (O Lord) has been (as I believe) long since
performed, as also thy rising again from death, and thine aftention into
heaven. These things therefore, thus truly of thee performed and finished, I
require thee (O Jesus) to draw me unto thee, as thou by thy promise art most
justly bound. I know thou art not angry, or (at the least) not at destance
with me: for seeing thou haste commanded me, that I be not at hatred with mine
enemy: I can not doubt, but that thou thy self also, keep truly this thy
sweet commandment: and so much the rather to be performed of thee, as thou
art more able than I, to express the use of charity. Thou can not say,
that thou art not bound to love me, alleging that I am thine ennemie, Math. 5.
or that I have done thee manifold injuries (which I must needs most truly
confess:) for if by thy precept of charity, thou have straightly bound me to
love mine enemies, to do them good, to help them in their need, and to pray
unto God for them: I know right well that in thus doing, thou art much more
bound than I. Wherefore, if thou will not love me as thy friend, love me yet
(at the least) as thine enemy do me good, help me in my necessities, and
pray to thine heavenly father for me, as thou art in deed most bound to do. I
do assuredly know, that thy virtue, thy goodness, and thine heavenly charity
is not so small, nor so stenderly planted in thee, that it will suffer it self
to be overcome of mine extreme unkindness or naughtiness: no, how greatly so
ever it abounds. Roma. 1.
Thy commandment charge me, that I (in any wise) suffer not my self to be
vanquished, by the malice of my enemies: and will thou suffer thy solfe to be
overcome, by my diffretship and lewdness. This verily has no likeness of
truth in it. Thou have taught and commanded me, that I with doing good to mine
enemies, do overcome and va^quish their malice: and I then require thee (O my
merciful Lord and only sauicure) that thou also thy self, observe this
divine precept and commandment of God thy father, as thy godly nature binds
thee. Pay thy debte I pray thee: that is, Christ's payment, and how.
vanquish my vain stoutnesse, my wickedness and great malice, with the virtue
of gentleness, and with thy most bounteous and plentiful goodness. And if I
have an heart before thee, hardened as the Adamant rock or Diamond: break it
then or mollify it (I beseech thee) with the piercing moisture of thy most
precious blood: O steep mine heart well therein, souple it, make it soft,
and temper it with the moisture of thy grace. O let thy Spirit then for ever
possess me, henceforthe assiste me, and be my most gracious and good guide,
that I may until the end, obey thy most holy will. O work mine heart a
new, after thine accustomed manner, and according to thy good promises of
old.

And if thou answer, Ezech 16.
that thou have many times mercifully for given me: Ezech. 16.
and that thou therefore will look no more upon me, or harken to my suit. I
answer: If thou gave Peter in commandment, Math 18.
that he should pardon his enemies, not seven times only, but seventy times
seven times: that is always, and as often as they shall offend him: It
follows then, that thou also art so much the more bound herein than I, for
as much as thou doste exceed me and all men, in all charity: and specially,
because that I have sinned, Sin of Gods elect.
not of any deadely malice, but through ignorance and frailty, and for that
both I and others, saw not rightly the majesty of him, whom we so offended,
neither could we make a right view of the goods which we did lose, nor of
the evils, in which we daily did incur. But thou peradventure wilt yet say: I
have given thee such plenty of light and true doctrine, by sending my
faithful preachers and ministers these many years unto thee, that thou art now
without excuse, and thy fault inexcusable. Against this do I yet reply: that
even to the Jews (thy peculier people) thou gauost such lights to see, and
such knowledge to perceive what thou was, that they were yet inexcusable, as
thou thy self dyddest say. And notwithstanding this, John. 15.
thou being in triumph upon the Cross, did make their excuse, and
prayed for them, saying: that in putting thee to that cruel death, they knew
not what they did. In consideration of which things, seeing thou art mine only
advocate, mine only Savior, Christ the only savior, the only ad^ocate.
my God and dearly beloved of thy father, my trust is in thee, that thou will
have mercy upon me, and pray for me. O pray for me therefore I beseech thee,
make mine excuse to thine and mine heavenly father: O save thou me, and then
shall I be safe. And if thou will yet lay to my charge (O thou just God)
that I have with earnest stoutnesse and rebellion offended thee: mine answer
again unto thee is (which see the secrotes of mine heart) that in so doing
I have done it, not wilfully and of malice, but rather of frayltie, or through
feruencie of zeal, with all singleness of heart, to seek only thy glory.
Wherein through want of knowledge, and the true light of thy holy Cospell, I
have disobediently and stubbornly committed iniquity: but yet, not in suthe
wise as does the damned reprobate, fixedly, of wylfull malice, Sin of the
reprobate.
or as an hater of thee: who by all possible means seeks thy dishonor, and
falls with all greedynesse from iniquity to iniquity. Therefore I doubt not
but such zeal or frayletie joined with simpleness, is pardonable before
thee, through the gretnesse of thy mercy: yea, it is so much the more to the
furtherance of thy glory (o Christ) rather than the only offenses committed of
mere simplicity, when the largeness of thy mercyes so bountifully flows
from thee. Yea, and I know assuredly, that through thy goodness and fervent
charity, thou act enforced to vanquishe and utterly overthrow my weakness,
wickeonesse, malice and blindness, even to the pardoning of all (from the
first to the last) that has been amiss. For if the just blood of Abell
called to God for vengeance against his brother to his condemnation, and
prevailed, The blood of Abel cried for vengeance.
I know that thy blood much more effectually calls to salvation: Christ's
blood calls to salvation.
and calling, obteineth abundance of Gods mercies for me. Save me therefore
(O my Lord and sweet Jesus) according to thy promyses and bond of great
charity: against the which, neither thou ought nor can resist. O save
me I beseech thee, and take me to thy mercy, sometune one of thy great
enemies, very wicked, very faithless, obstinate, headie and rebellious: but
now thy loving brother, thy faithful friend, thine obediente lover, and a
sound member of thy body. O save me then I say, comfort my soul, guide me
in thy ways, strengthen me, and let not thy spirit depart from me, that I
may hencefoorthe joyfully please thee, and render always unto thy father
(through thee) all due praise, honor, and glory, here in this vale of myserie,
and in the everlasting world which is to come. Amen.
