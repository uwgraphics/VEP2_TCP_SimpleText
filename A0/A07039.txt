Hay any work for Cooper: Or a brief Pistle directed by way of an
hublication to the reverende Byshopps / counselling them / if they will needs
be barrelled up / for fear of smelling in the nostrels of her Majesty and the
State / that they would use the advice of reverend Martin / for the providing
of their Cooper. Because the reverend T.C. (by which mystical letters / is
understood / either the bounsing Parson of Eastmeane, or Tom Coakes his
Chaplain) to be an unskillful and a beceytfull tubtrimmer.

Wherein worthy Martin quits himself like a man I warrant you / in the modest
defense of his self and his learned Pistles / and makes the Coopers hoopes to
fly off / and the Bishops Tubs to leake out of all cry.

Penned and compiled by Martin the Metropolitan.

Printed in Europe / not far from some of the Bounsing Priests.

A man of worshipp / to the men of worship / that is / Martin Marprelate
gentleman / Primate / and Metropolitan of all the Martins whersoeuer. To the
John of all the sir John's / and to the rest of the terrible priests: says have
among you once again my clergy masters. For
O Brethren / there is such a deal of love grown of late I perceive / between
you and me / that although I would be negligent in sending my Pistles unto you:
yet I see you cannot forget me. I thought you to be very kind when you sent
your Purcivaunts about the country to seek for me. But now that you your
selves have taken the pains to write / this is out of all cry. Why it passes
to think what loving and careful brethren I have / who although I cannot be
gotten / to tell them where I am / because I love not the air of the Clinke or
Gatehouse in this cold time of Winter / and by reason of my business in
Pistlemaking / will notwithstanding make it known unto the world / that they
have a months mind toward me. Now truly brethren / I find you kind / why ye
do not know what a pleasure you have done me. My worships books were unknown
to many / before you allowed T.C. to admonish the people of England to take
heed / that if they loved you / they would make much of their prelates / and
the chief of the clergy. Now many seek after my books / more then ever
they did. Again / some knew not that our brother John of Fulham / was so good
unto the porter of his gate / as to make the poor blind honest soul / to be
a dum minister. Many did not know / either that Amen / is as much as by my
faith / and so that our Savior Christ ever swear by his faith: or that
bowling and eating of the Sabbath / are of the same nature: that Bb. may as
lawfully make blind guydes / as David might eat of the Show bread: or that
father Thomas tubtrimmer of Winchester / good old student / is a master of Arts
of 45. years standing. Many I say / were ignorant of these things / and many
other pretty toys / until you wrote this pretty book. Besides whatsoever
you ouerpasse in my writings / and did not gainsay / that I hope will be judged
to be true. And so John a Bridges his treason out of the 448. page of his book
/ you grant to be true. Your selves you deny not to be petty popes. The B.
of sir David's in Wales / you deny not to have two wives / with an hundred
other things which you do not gainsay: so that the reader may judge that I am
true of my word / and use not to lie like Bb. And this has greatly commended
my worshipps good dealing. But in your confutation of my book / you have showed
reverend Martin to be truepenie in deed: For you have confyrmed / rather then
confuted him. So that brethren / the pleasure which you have done unto me / is
out of all scotche and notche. And should not I again be as ready to
pleasure you? Nay / then I should be as ungrateful toward my good brethren /
as John of Cant. is to Thomas Cartwright. The which John / although he has bin
greatly favored by the said Thomas / in that Thomas has now these many years
let him alone and said nothing unto him / for not answering his books / yet is
not ashamed to make a secret comparison / between himself and Thomas
Cartwright. As who say / John of Lambehith / were as learned as Thomas
Cartwright. What say you old deane John a Bridges / have not you showed your
self thankful unto her Majesty / in overthrowing her supremacy in the 448.
page of your book. I will lay on load on your skincoat for this gear anon.

And I will have my penyworths of all of you brethren ere I have done with you
/ for this pains which your T.C has taken with me. This is the puritans craft
/ in procuring me to be confuted I know: I Will be even with them to. A crafty
whoresons brethren Bb. did you think / because ye puritans T.C. did set John
of Cant, at a nonplus, and gave him the overthrow / that therefore your T.C.
alias Thomas Cooper bishop of Winchester / or Thomas Cook his Chaplain /
could set me at a nonplus. Simple fellows / me thinks he should not.

I guess your T.C. to be Thomas Cooper (but I do not peremptorily affirm it)
because the modest old student of 52. years standing / sets Winchester
after Lincoln and Rochester in the contents of his book / which blasphemy /
would not have bin tolerated by them that saw and allowed the book / unless
mistres Coopers husband had bin the author of it.

Secondly / because this T.C. the author of this book is a bishop / and
therefore Thomas Cooper / he is a Bishop / because he reckons him self
charged amongst others / with those crimes whereof non are accused but bishops
alone / page 101. lin. 26. Ha old Martin yet I-see thou have it in thee / thou will enter into the bowels of the cause in hand I perceue. Nay if you will
commend me / I will give you more reasons yet. The style and the phrase is very
like her husbands / yt was sometimes wont to write unto doctor Day of Wells.
You see I can do it in deed. Again / non would be so groshead as to gather /
because my reverence tells Deane John / that he shall have twenty fists about
his ears more then his own (whereby I meant in deed / that many would write
against him / by reason of his bomination learning / which otherwise never meant
to take pen hand) that I threatened him with blows / and to deal by stafford
law: Whereas that was far from my meaning / and could by no means be gathered
out of my words / but only by him that pronounced Eulojin for Enlogeni in the
pulpit: and by him whom a papist made to believe / that the greek word
Enlogeni, that is to give thanks / signifies to make a cross in the forhead:
py hy hy hy. I cannot but laugh / py hy hy hy. I cannot but laugh / to think
that an old soaking student in this learned age / is not ashamed to be so
impudent as to presume to deal with a papist / when he has no grue in his
pocked. But I promise you Sir / it is no shame to be a L. bishop if a man could
/ though he were as unlearned as John of Gloucester or William of Liechfeld. And I
tell you true / our brother Westchester / had as live play twenty nobles in a
night / at Priemeero on the cards / as trouble him self with any pulpit labor
/ and yet he thinks him self to be a sufficient bishop. What a bishop such a
cardplaier? A bishop play 20. nobles in a night? Why a round threpence serves
the turn to make good sport 3. or 4. nights amongst honest neighbors. And take
heed of it brother Westchester: it is an unlawful game if you will believe
me. Foe / in winter it is no matter to take a little sport / for an od cast
braces of 20. nobles when the wether is foul / that men cannot go abroad to
boules / or to shoot? What would you have men take no recreatio^? Ye but it is
an old said saw / enough is as good as a feast. And recreations must not be
made a trade and an occupation / ^a master Martin Marprelate. I tell you true
brother mine / though I have as good a gift in pistle making / as you have at
priemeero / and far more delight then you can have at your cards / for the love
I bear to my brethren / yet I dare not use this sport / but as a recreation /
not making any trade thereof. And cards I tell you though they be without horns
/ yet they are parlous beasts. Be they lawful or unlawful take heed of them for all that. For you cannot use them but you must needs say your brother T.C. his
Amen / that is / swear by your faith / many a time in the night / well I will
never stand argling the matter any more with you. If you will leave your card
playing so it is / if you will not / trust to it it will be the worse for you.

I must go simply and plainly to work with my brethren / that have published
T.C. Whosoever have published that book / they have so hooped the bishops
tubbs / that they have made them to smell far more odious then ever they did /
even in the nostrels of all men. The book is of 252. pages. The drift thereof
is / to confute certain printed and published libelles. You bestow not full
50. pages in the answer of any thing that ever was published in print. The
rest are bestowed to maintain the belly / and to confute: what think you? Even
the slanderous inventions of your own brains for the most part. As yt it is
not lawful for her Majesty to allot any lands unto the maintenance of the
minister / or the minister to live upon lands for this purpose allotted unto
him / but is to content him self with a small pention / and so small / as he
have nothing to leave for his wife and children after him (for whom he is not
to be careful / but to rest on gods providence) and is to require no more but
food and raiment / that in poverty he might be answerable unto our Savior
Christ and his apostles. In the confutation of these points / and the
scriptures corruptly aplied to prove them / there is bestowed above an 100.
pages of this book / that is / from the 149. unto the end. Well T.C. whosoever
thou art / and whosoever Martin is / neither thou / nor any man or woman in
England shall know while you live / suspect and trouble as many as you will / and
therefore save your money in seeking for him / for it may be he is nearer you
then you are ware of. But whosoever thou art I say / thou show thy self to
be a most notorious wicked slanderer / in fathering these things upon those
whom they call puritans / which never any enjoying common sense would affirm.
And bring me him / or set down his name and his reasons that holds any of
the former points confuted in thy book / and I will prove him to be utterly
bereaved of his wits / and his confuter to be either stark mad / or a stark
enemy to al religion / yea to her Majesty and the state / of this kingdom. No
no / T.C. puritans hold no such points. It were well for bishops / that their
adversaries were thus sottishe. They might then justly insence her Majesty and
the state against them / if they were of this mind. These objections / in the
confutation whereof / thou have bestowed so much time / are so far from
having any puritan to be their author / as whosoever reads the book / were
he as blockheaded as Thomas of Winchester himself / he may easily know them
to be objections only invented by the author of the book himself. For
although he be an impudent wretch / yet dares he not set them down / as
writings of any other: for then he would have described the author and the
book by some adient.

The puritans in deed / hold it unlawful for a minister to have such
temporal reuenews / as whereby ten ministers might be well maintained /
unless the said reuenews come unto him by inheritance.

They hold it also unlawful / for any state to bestow the livings of many
ministers upon one alone / especially when there is such want of ministers
livings.

They hold it unlawful for any minister to be Lord over his brethren. And
they hold it unlawful for any state to tolerate such under their
government. Because it is unlawful for states / to tolerate men in th^se
places whereinto the word has forbidden them to enter.

They affirm that our Savior Christ / has forbidden all ministers to be
Lords / Luke. 22.25. And the Apostle Peter / shows them to be none of Gods
ministers / which are Lords over Gods heritage / as you Bishopps are / and
would be accounted. Those things T.C. y^^ should have confuted / and not
troubles your self / to execute the fruits of your own brains / as an
enemy to the state. And in these points / I do challenge you T.C. and you
Deane John / and you John Whi^gift / and you doctor Coosins / and you doctor
Caprase (Cop^^^ (...) your name be) and as many else / as have or dare write in
the defense of the established church government. If you cannot confute my
former assertions / you do but in vain think to maintain your selves by
slanders / in fathering upon the puritanes / the ofspringes of your own
blockheads. And assure your selves / I will so besoop you if you cannot defend
your selves in these points / as all the world shall cry shame upon you / you
think protely to escape the point of your Antichristian calings / by giving out
that puritans hold it unlawful for her majesty to leave any lands for the use
of the ministers maintenance, I cannot but commend you / for I promise you /
you can shift of an heinous accusation very pretily.

A true man brings unanswerable witnesses against a robber by the high way
side / and desires the judge / that the law may proceed against him. O no my
Lord says the thief / in any case let not me be dealt with. For these mine
accusers have given out / that you are a drunkard or they have committed
treason against the state: therefore I pray you believe my slander against the^
/ that they may be executed: so when I come to my trial / I shall be sure to have
no accusers. A very pretty way to escape / if a man could tell how to bring the
matter about. Now brethren bishops / your manner of dealing / is even the very
same. The puritans say truly / that al Lord bishops are pety Antichrists / and
therefore that the magistrates ought to thrust you out of the commonwealth.
Now of all loves say the bishops / let not our places be called in question /
but rather credit our slanders against the puritans / whereby / if men would
believe us when we lie / we would bear the world in hand / that these our
accusers are Malcontents and sottish men / holding it unlawful for the
maiestrat to alott any lands for the ministers portion / and unlawful for the
minister to provide for his family. And therefore you must not give ear to the
accusations of any such men against us. And so we shall be sure to be acquitted.
But brethren do you think to be thus cleared? why the puritans hold no such
points as you lay to their charg. Though they did / as they do not / yet that
were no sufficient reason / why you being pettye popes / should be maintained
in a christian commonwealth. Answer the reasons that I brought against you:
otherwise / Come off you bishops / leave your thousands / and content your
selves with your hundreds / says John of London. So that you do plainly see /
that your Cooper T.C. is but a deceitful workman / and if you commit the
hooping of your bishoprics unto him / they will so leake in a short space / as
they shall be able to keep never a Lord bishop in them. And this may serve for
an answer unto the latter part of your book / by way of an Interim / until
more work for Cooper be published.

Hay any work for Cooper.
ANd now reverend T.C. I am come to your epistle to the reader / but first you
and I must go out alone into the plain fields / and there we will try it out /
even by plain syllogismes / and that I know bishops cannot abide to hear of.

The reverend T.C. to the reader. page 1.
I draw great danger upon my self / in defending our bishops and others the
chief of the clargy of the church of England. Their adversaries are very eger:
the saints in heaven have felt of their tongs / for when they speak of Paul /
Peter / Marye / etc. whom others justly call saints: they in derision call
them sir Peter / sir Paul / sir Marie.

Reverend Martin.
Alas poor reverend T.C. Be not afraid. Here be non but friends man. I hope
thou art a good fellow / and a true subject / ye but I defend the bishops of
the church of England says he / then in deed I marvel not though thy
conscience accuse thee / and thou art sure to be as well fauoredly / thwacked
for thy lalour / as ever thou wast in thy life. Thy conscience I say / must
needs make thee fear in defending them. For they are petty popes / and petty
Antichrists as I have proved / because they are pastor of pastors / etc. thou
have not answered my reasons / and therefore swadled thou shall be for thy
pains / and yet if thou will yield I will spare thee. Thou can not be a good
and a sound subject and defend the hierarchy of Lord bishopps to be lawful /
as I will show anon. Concerning Sir Paul / I have him not at all in my
writings. And therefore the reader must know / that there is a canterbury trick
once to patch up an acusation with a lie or two.

Sir Peter was the oversight of the printer / who omitted this Marginal note
vz. He was not Saint Peter which had a lawful superior authority over the
universal body of the church. And therefore the priest whereof Deane John
speaks was Sir Peter.

And good reverend T.C. I pray thee tell me / what kin was Saint Mary Oueries /
to Mary the Virgin. In my book learning / the one was some popish Trull / and
the other the blessed virgin. But will you have all those / who are saints in
deed / called saints? Why then why do you not call saint Abraham / saint Sara
/ saint Jeremy. If John of Canterbury should marie / tell me good T.C. do
thou not think that he would not make choice of a godly woman. I hope a would.
And T.C. though you are learned / yet you go beyond your books if you said
the contrary: being a godly woman / then she were a saint. And so by your rule
/ her name being Marie / you would have her called saint Marie Canterbury.
But I promise thee / did his grace what he could / I would call her sir Marie
Canterbury as long as he professed himself to be a priest / and this I might
do lawfully. For he being sir John / why should not his wife be sir Marie. And
why not sir Marie Oueries / as well as sir Marie Canterbury? I hope John of
Canterbury whom I know / (though I know no great good in him) to be as honest
a man as M. Oueries was / whom I did not know. Neither is there any reason why
you T.C. should hold M. Oueries and his Marie / because they are within the
diocese of Winchester / to be more honest then M. Canterbury and his wife.
Nay there is more reason / why M. Canterbury and his wife dwelling at
Lambehith / should be thought the honester of the two / then Oueries and his
wife / because they dwell O the banks side. But good Tom tubtrimmer / tell me
what you mean by the chief of the clergy in the Church of England? John
Canterbury I am sure. Why good T.C. this speech is either blasphemous / or
traitorous / or by your own confession an evident proof / that John of
Canterbury is Lord over his brethren. He that is chief of the clergy / is
chief of Gods heritage / and that is Jesus Christ only / and so to make the
pope of Canterbury chief of Gods heritage / in this sense is blasphemous. If
you mean by clergy / as Deane John does page 443. of his book / both the
people and ministers of the Church of England: in this sense her Majesty is
chief of the clergy in the Church of England / and so your speech is
traitorous. Lastly / if by clergy you mean the ministers of the Church of
England / none in this sense can be chief of the clergy / but a petty pope.
For our Savior Christ flatly forbids any to be chief of the clergy in
this sense / Luke 22.26. And none ever claimed this unto him self but a petty
pope. Therefore T.C. you are either by your own speech / a blasphemer or a
traitor / or else John of Cant. is a petty pope. Here is good spoonemeat for a
Cooper. Take heed of writing against Martin / if you love your ease.

Reverend T.C. page 2. Epistle.
But I fear them not / while I go about to maintain the dignity of priests.

Reverend Martin.
Well fare a good heart yet / stand to thy tackling / and get the high
commission to send abroad the purciuants / and I warrant thee thou will do
something. Alas good priests / that their dignity is like to fall to the
ground. It is pity it should be so / they are such notable pulpit men. There
is a neighbor of ours / an honest priest / who was sometimes (simple as he
now stands) a vice in a play for want of a better / his name is Gliberie of
Hawsteade in Essex / he goes much to the pulpit. On a time / I think it was the
last May / he went up with a full resolution / to do his business with great
commendations. But see the fortune of it. A boy in the Church / hearing either
the summer Lord with his May game / or Robin Hood with his Morris dance
going by the Church / out goes the boy. Good Gliberie / though he were in the
pulpit / yet had a mind to his old companions abroad (a company of merry
grigs you must think them to be / as merry as a vice on a stage) seeing ye boy
going out / finished his matter presently with John of Londons Amen, saying /
ha / ye faith boie / are they there / then ha with thee / and so came down and
among them he goes. Were it not then pity / that the dignity of such a
priest should decaie. And I would gentle T.C. that you would take the pains to
write a treatise against the boie with the red cap / which put this Gliberie
out of his matter at another time. For Glibery being in the pulpit / so
fastened his eyes upon a boy with a red cap / that he was clean dashed out of
countenance / in so much that no note could be hard from him at that time /
but this. Take away red cap there / take away red cappe there: it had been
better that he had never bin borne / he has marred such a sermon this day /
as it is wonderful to think. The Queen and the Counsel might well have
heard it for a good sermon / and so came down. An admonition to the people of
England / to take heed of boi^s with red caps / which make them set light by
the dignity of their priests / would do good in this time / brother T.C. you
know well.

Reverend T.C.
You may herby perceive that T.C. is a bishop
The cause why we are so spighted / is because we do endeavor to maintain the
laws which her Majesty and the whole state of the Realm have allowed / and
do not admit a new platform of government / devised I know not by whom.

Reverend Martin.
Why T.C. say Eulojin for Eulogein as often as you will / and I will never
spite you / or the Bishop of Winchester either for the matter. But do you
think our Church government / to be good and lawful because her Majesty
and the state / who maintain the reformed religion allows the same? Why the
Lord does not allow it / therefore it cannot be lawful. And it is the falt of
such wretches as you bishops are / that her Majesty and the state allows the
same. For you should have other / wise instructed them. They know you not yet
so thoroughly as I do. So that if I can prove / that the Lord disliketh our
Church government / your endeavors to maintain the same / show that thereby
you cannot choose / but be traitors to God and his word / whatsoever you are to
her Majesty and the State. Now T.C. look to your self / for I will
presently make all the hoops of your bishoppricks fly assunder. Therefore

Our Church government, is an unlawful Church government, and not allowed
in the sight of God.

Because

That church government is an unlawful church government / the offices and
officers whereof / the civil maiestrate may lawfully abollish out of the church
/ mark my craft in reasoning brother T.C. I say the offices and officers for I
grant that the maiestrate may thrust the officers of a lawful church government
out of the church if they be Diotripheses / Mar-elmes / Whitgifts / Simon
Maugustes / Coopers / Pernes / Kenoldes / or any such like Iudases / (though
the most of these must be packing offices and al) but their offices must stand
/ that the same may be supplied by honester men. But the offices of Archbishops
and bishopps / and therefore the officers much more / may be lawfully
abollished out of the church by her Majesty and our State. And truly this
were brave weather to turn them out: it is pity to keep them in any longer.
And that would do me good at the heart, to see John of London / and the rest of
his brethren so discharged of his business / as he might freely runn in his
cassocke and hose after his bowl / or flourish with his 2. hand sword. O it is a
sweet trunchfiddle.

But the offices of Archbishops and bishops / may be lawfully abollished out of
the church by her Majesty / and the state. As I hope one day they shall be.
Therefore (mark now T.C. and carry me this conclusion to John O Lambehith for
his breakefast) our church government by Arch. and bishops / is an unlawful
church government. You see brother Cooper / that I am very courteous in my minor
/ for I desire therein no more offices to be thrust out of the church at one
time / but Archb. and Bishops. As for Deanes Archdeacons and Chancellors / I
hope they will be so kind unto my Lords grace / as not to stay / if his worship
and the rest of the noble clergy Lords wear turned out to grass. I will
presently prove both mayor and minor of this sillogisme. And hold my cloak
there sombody / that I may go roundly to work. For ise so bumfeg the Cooper /
as he had bin better to have hooped half the tubbes in Winchester / then write
against my worships pistles.

No civil maiestrat may lawfully either maime or deforme the body of Christ /
which is the church / but whosoever does abollish any lawful church officer /
out of the church government / he does either maime or deforme the church.
Therefore T.C. no civil magistrate / no prince / no state / may without sin
abollishe any lawful officer / together with his office / out of the
government of the church / and per consequence, the offices of Archbishops and
Lord bishops / which her Majesty may without sin lawfully abollish out of the
church / are no lawful church officers / and therefore also / the church
government practiced by John Whitgift / John Mar-elme / Richard Peterborow /
William of Lincoln / Edmond of Worcestor / yea and by that old stealecounter
mass priest / John O Glossester / with the rest of his brethren / is to be
presently thrust out of the church. And me thinks this gear cottons in deed my
masters. And I told you T.C. that you should be thumped for defending bishops.
Take heed of me while you live. The minor of my last sillogisme / that
whosoever does abollish the office of any lawful thurch officer out of the
church / he either maimeth or deformeth the church / I can prove with a wet
finger. Because every lawful Church officer / even by reason of his office /
is a member of the body of Christ Jesus / which is the church / and being a
member of the body / If the maiestrate does displace him by abollishing his
office / and leaves the place thereof void / then the maiestrate maimeth the
body. If he put another office unto an officer in stead thereof / he deformeth
the same. Because the maiestrate has neither the skill nor the commission / to
make the members of the body of Christ. Because he cannot tell to what use / the
members of his making may serve in the church. Do you think T.C. that the
maiestrat may make an eye for the visible body of the church. (For you must
understand / that we all this while speak of the visible body) can he make a
foot or a hand for that body? I pray you in what place of the body would you
have them placed? If our Savior Christ has left behind him a perfect body:
surely he has left therein no place or / no use for members of the maiestrates
making and invention: if an imperfect and maimed body / I am well assured that
the maiestrate is not able to perfect that which he left unfinished. But I hope
T.C. that thou will not be so mad / and wicked / as to say that our Savior
Christ / left behind him here on earth an imperfect and maimed body. If not /
then where shall these offices / namely these members invented by the maiestrate
be placed therein.

Would you have the natural eyes put out (as your brethren the bishops have
don in the church of England / ever since John of Canterbury urged his wretched
subscription) and unnatural squint gogled eyes put in their steed: when the
body cannot see with any eyes / but with the natural eyes thereof / displace
them howsoever you may seem to help the matter / by putting others in their
steed / yet the body shall be still blind and maimed. What say you T.C. may the
Maiestrate cut of the true and natural legs / and hands of the body of
Christ / under a pretense to put wooden in their steed. I hope you will not
say that he may. How then comes it to pass T.C. that you hold John of
Canterbury his office / and John Mar-elms to be true and natural members of the
body / that is true officers of the church / and yet hold it laweful for her
Majesty to displace them out of the church. I-cannot tell brother what you hold
in this point. Me think I have disturbed your senses. Do you think that the
maiestrat may displace the true members of the body of Christ / and place
wooden in their steed. Why this is to hold it lawful for the maiestrate to
massacre the body. Do you think he may not? Then may not her majesty displace
John of Canterburies office out of our church: if she may not displace his
office / then either he by virtue of his office / is a lawful Pope above all
civil magistrates / or else the Church government is so prescribed in the word
/ as it is not lawful for the magestrate to alter the same. But John of
Canterbury / as the puritans their selves confess / is no Pope. Puritans
confess John Cant. to be no Pope.
Then either the church government is so prescribed in the word as it may not
be altered / or else the magestrat may abolish a lawful church government / and
place another in stead thereof. If the Church government be so prescribed in
the word / as it cannot be altered / then either our government is ye same
which was therein prescribed / or our Church government is a false
Churchgouerment. If ours be the same which is mentioned in the word: Then Paul
and Peter were either no true Church governors / or else Paul and Peter / and
the rest of Church governors in their time were Lords / for all our Church
governors are Lords. But Paul and Peter / etc. were no Lords / and yet true
church governors. Therefore our Church government is not that which is
prescribed in the word: and therefore a false and unlawful church government.
If you think that the magistrate may displace the lawful offices of the body
/ then as I said before / you hold it lawful for the magistrate to maime or
deforme the body. Because whatsoever he pulls in the room of the true and
right members / must needs be a deformity / and what place soever he leaves
unfurnished of a member / must needs be a maime. And this is the only and
sole office of Christ only / to place and displace the members of his body:
to wit / the officers of his Church / he may lawfully do it / so cannot man.
And therefore the sots (of which number you T.C. and you John Whitgift / and
you Deane John / and you D. Coosins / and you D. Copcot / with the rest of the
ignorant and wretched defendors of our corrupt church government are to be
accounted) which think that the offices of pastors / doctors / elders and
deacons / or the most of them / may be as well now wanting in the Church / as
the offices of Apostles / prophets and Evangelists: do notably bewray their
vile ignorance / but the cause they do not hurt. For the beasts do not
consider that the offices of Apostles / Evangelists and Prophets / were removed
out of the church / not by man / but by the Lord / because he in his wisdom
did not see any use of such members in his body / after the time of the first
planting of the Church. The apostles chose non in fled of James being beheded
as they did in steed of Judas Act. 1. which they would have don if the
apos^olicall calling had been permanent.
I say they were removed by the Lord himself and not by man: because / partly
the gifts wherewith they were endued / partly the largeness of their
commission / with certain other essential properties to them belonging / were
by him abrogated and taken away / which no man could do. Again / the
Apostolical / Euangelical and prophetical callings / were either lawfully or
unlawfully abolished out of the Church / if lawfully / then they were
abolished by the Lord: and therefore they are neither to be called back until
he shows it to be his pleasure that it should be so / neither can the church
be truly said to be maimed for want of them: because he which could best tell
/ what members were fit for his Church did abolishe them. If unlawfully /
then those callings may be lawfully called back again into the church / and
the church without them is maimed / that is / wants some members. For if
their callings were injuriously abrogated / they are as injuriously kept out of
the church: and being members of the church / the church is maimed without /
unless the Lord has showed / that the time of their service in the body is
expired. But they are not injuriously kept out (for so her Majesty should be
said to injury the church / unless she would see Apostles / prophets and
Evangelists / planted therein) neither can the church be said to be maimed for
want of them / because the Lord by taking them away has declared / that now
there can be no use of them in the body: therefore the Lord abrogated them.
Therefore also they may be wanting / and the church neither maimed nor
deformed thereby. Whereas the keeping out of either of the former offices of
pastors / doctors / elders and deacons / is a maiming of the church / the
placing of others in their steed / a deforming. Now reverend T.C. I beseech you
entreat mistress Cooper / to write to M.D. Day / sometimes of magdalins / that he
may procure D. Cooper / to know of him that was the last Thomas of Lincoln /
whether the now B. of Winchester be not persuaded / that reverend Martin has
suffiently proved it to be unlawful / for the civil magestrate / to abolishe
any lawful church officer out of the church. Because it is unlawful for him
to maime or deforme the body of Christ / by displacing the members thereof.
But it may be / your Coopers noddle profane T.C. doubts / (for I know you to
be as ignorant in these points / as John Whitgift / or dean John their selves.)

Whether a lawful Church officer, in regard of his office, be a member of the
body of Christ, which is the Church.

Therefore look Romans 12. verse. 4.5. etc. and there you shall see / that
whosoever has an office in the body / is a member of the body. There also
you shall see / that he that teaches / which is the Doctor: he yt exhorts /
which is the Pastor: he that rules / which is the Elder: he that distributeth
/ which is the Deacon (as for him that shows mercy that is there spoken off
/ he is but a church servant / and no church officer) There I say / you shall
also see / that these 4. offices / of Pastors / Doctors / Eleders and Deacons /
are members of the body: and 1. Cor. 12.8. and 28. you shall see that God has
ordained them. Out of al / which hitherto I have spoken T.C. I come upon you /
and your bishopprickes / with 4. or 5. (yea half a dozen and need be) such
dry soopes / as John of London with his two hand sword never gave the like.
For they answer your whole profane book. First / that the platform of
government / by Pastors / Doctors / Elders and deacons / which you say was
devised you know not by whom / is the invention of our Savior Christ. For God
ordained them / says the apostle / 1. cor. 12.8.28. And therefore unless you
will show your self / either to be a blasphemer / by terming Jesus Christ / to
be you cannot tell whom / or else to be ignorant who is Jesus Christ: you must
needs acknowledge the platform of government / which you say / was invented by
you know not who^ / to have Christ Jesus for the author thereof.

Secondly / that the word of God teaches / that of necessity / the government
by Pastors / doctors / elders / etc. ought to be in every Church / which is
neither maimed nor deformed. This. T. Cooper gainsaieth page 2. of his Epistle.
Because that Church must needs be maimed which wants those members / which
the Lord has appointed to be therein: unless the Lord himself has / by
taking those members away / showed that now his body is to have no use of
them. But as has been said / God has ordained pastors / doctors / elders and
deacons to be in his Church / proved out of Romans 12.6.7.8. 1. cor. 12.8.28.
ephe. 4.12. And he has not taken these officers away out of his church /
because the Church has continual need of them. As of Pastors to feed with the
word of wisdom: of the Doctors / to feed with the word of knowledge / and
both to build up his body in the unity of faith: of Elders / to watch and
ouersee men's manners: of Deacons to look unto the poor / and church treasury.
Therefore / where these 4. officers are wanting / there the Church is imperfect
in her regiment.

T. Cooper says it is / page second / Epist.
Thirdly that this government cannot be inconvenient for any State or kingdom.
For is it inconvenient for a State or kingdom / to have the body of Christ
perfect therein?

Fourthly that every christian magestrate is bound to receue this government /
by Pastors / Doctors / Elders and deacons into the church / within his
dominions / whatsoever inconvenience may be likely to follow the receuing of
it. Because no likelihood of inconvenience ought to induce the magistrate
willingly to permit the church under his government / to be maimed or deformed.

Fifthly that the government of the church by Lord Archbishops and bishops / is a
government of deformed and unshapen members / serving for no good use in the
church of God. Because it is not the government by pastors / doctors elders and
deacons / which as I have showed are now the only true membes / that is the
only true officers of the visible body.

Sixthly and lastly. That they who defend this false and bastardly government of
Archbishops and bishops / and withstand this true and natural government of the
church / by Pastors / Doctors / Elders and deacons / are likely in awhile to
become / Mar-prince / Mar-state / Mar-lawe / Mar-magestrate / Mar-common
wealth. As for Mar-church / and Mar-religion / they have long since proved them
selves to be.

These six points do necessarily follow / of that which before I have set
down / namely that it is not lawful for any to abollish or alter / the true
and lawful government of the church / because it is not lawful for them to
maime or deforme the body of the church.

And I chaleng you T.C. and you Deane John / and you John Whitgift / and you D.
Coosins: and you D. Copcot / and all the rest that will or dare defend our
established Church government / to be tried with me in a judgment of life
and death / at any bar in England in this point. Namely /

That you must needs be, not only traitors to God and his word, but also
enemies unto her Majesty and the land, in defending the established Church
government to be lawful.

You see the accusation which I lay to your charge / and here follows the
proof of it. They who defend that the prince and state / may bid God to battle
against them / they are not only traitors against God and his word / but also
enemies to the Prince and state. I think John of Gloucester himself / will not
be so sensles as to deny this.

But our Archbishops and bishops / which hold it lawful for her majesty and
the state / to retain this established form of government / and to keep out
the government by pastors / doctors / elders and deacons / which was appointed
by Christ / whom you profane T.C. call you know not whom / hold it lawful for
her majesty and the state to bid God to battle against them. Because they bid
the Lord to battle against them which maime and deforme the body of Christ /
vz. the church. And they as ^as declared maime and deforme the body of the
church / which keep out the lawful offices / appointed by the Lord to be members
thereof / and in their steed / place other wooden members of the inuenteon of
man. Therefore you T.C. and you Deane John / and you John Whitgift / and you
the rest of the beastly defendors of the corrupt church government / are not
only traitors to God and his word / but enemies to her majesty and the state.
Like you any of these Nuts John Canterbury. I am not disposed to jest in this
serious matter. I am called Martin Marprelat. There be many that greatly
dislike of my doings. I may have my wants I know. For I am a man. But my
course I know to be ordinary and lawful. I saw the cause of Christ's
government / and of the Bishops Antichristian dealing to be hidden. The most
part of men could not be gotten to read any thing / written in the defense of
the (...) and against the other. I bethought me therefore / of a way whereby
men might be drawn to do both / perceiving the humors of men in these times
(especialy of those that are in any place) to be given to mirth. I took that
course. I might lawfully do it. I / for jesting is lawful by circumstances /
even in the greatest matters. The circumstances of time / place and persons
urged me thereunto. I never profaned the word in any jest. Other mirth I used
as a covert / wherein I would bring the truth into light. The Lord being the
author both of mirth and gravity / is it not lawful in it self / for the
truth to use either of these ways / when the circumstances do make it lawful?

My purpose was and is to do good. I know I have don no harm howsoever some may
judge Martin to mar al. They are very weak one that so think. In that which I
have written I know undoubtedly / that I have done the Lord and the state of
this kingdom great service. Because I have in some sort / discovered the
greatest enemies thereof. And by so much the most pestilent enemies / because
they wound Gods relligion / and corrupt the state with Atheism and loosnes /
and so call for Gods vengance upon us all / even under the coulor of relligion.
I affirm them to be the greatest enemies that now our state has / for if it
were not for them / the truth should have more free passage herein / then now
it has. All states thereby would be amended: and so we should not be subject
unto Gods displeasure / as now we are by reason of them.

Now let me deal with these that are in authority. I do make it known unto
them / that our bishops are the greatest enemies which we have. For they do not
only go about / but they have long since / fully persuaded our state / that
they may lawfully procure the Lord / to take the sword in hand against the
state: if this be true / have I not said truly / that they are the gretest
enemies which our state has. The papists work no such effect / for they are
not trusted. The Atheistes have not infected our whole state / these have. The
attempts of our foreign enemies may be pernicious. But they are men as we
are. But that God / which when our bishops have / and do make our prince / and
our governors to wadge war / who is able to stand against him?

Well to the point / many have put her majesty / the parliament and counsel in
mind / that the church officers now among us / are not such as the Lord
aloweth of: because they are not of his own ordaininge. They have showed that
this falt is to be amended / or the Lords hand to be looked for. The bishops on
the otherside / have cried out upon them / that have thus dutifully moved the
state. They with a loud voice gave out / that the maiestrat may lawfully
maintain that church government / which best fitteth our estate / as living in
ye time of peace. What do they else herein / but say that the magestrat in time
of peace / may maime and deforme the body of Christ his church. That Christ
has left the government of his own house imperfect / and left the same to the
discretion of the magestrate / whereas Moses before whom in this point of
government / the Lord Christ is justly preferred / Heb. 3.6. made the
government of the legal polity so perfcet / as he left not any part thereof /
to the discretion of the magestrate. Can they deny church officers / to be
members of the church. They are refuted by the express text. 1. Cor. 12. will
they affirm Christ to have left behind him an imperfect body of his church /
wanting members at the lest wise / having such members as were only permanent
at the magestrates pleasure. Why Moses the servant / otherwise governed the
house in his time. And the son is commended in this point for wisdom / and
faithfulness before him. Heb 3.6. Either then / that commendation of the son
before the servant / is a false testimony / or the son ordained a permanent
government in his church. If permanent / not to be changed. What then / do they
that hold it may be changed at the magestrates pleasure / but advise the
maiestrate by his positive laws / to proclaim that it is his will / that if
there shall be a church within his dominions / he will maime and deforme the
same. He will ordain therein / what members he thinks good. He will make it
known / that Christ under his government / shall be made less faithful then
Moses was. That he has left the placing of members in his body unto the
magestrate. O cursed beasts / that bring this guilt upon our estate. Repent
Caitifes while you have time. You shall not have it I fear when you will. And
look you that are in authority unto the equity of the controversy / between
our wicked bishops / and those who would have the disorders of our Church
amended. Take heed you be not carried away with slanders. Christ's government is
neither Mar-prince / Mar-state / Mar-law nor Mar-magistrate. The living God
whose cause is pleaded for / will be revenged of you / if you give ear unto
this slander / contrary to so many testimonies as are brought out of his word /
to prove the contrary. He denounces his wrath against all you / that think
it lawful for you / to maim or deform his church: he accounts his Church
maimed / when those offices are therein placed / which he has not appointed
to be members thereof: he also testifies that there be no members of his
appointment in the Church / but such as he himself has named in his word /
and those that he has named / man must not displace / for so he should put
the body out of joint. Now our bishops holding the contrary / and bearing you
in hand / that you may practice the contrary / do they not drive you to
provoke the Lord to anger against your own souls? And are they not your
enemies? They hold the contrary I say / for they say that her Majesty may
alter this government now established / and thereby they show either this
government to be unlawful / or that the magistrate may presume to place those
members in Gods Church / which the Lord never mentioned in his word. And I
beseech you mark how the case stands between these wretches / and those
whom they call puritans.

1 The puritans (falsely so called) show it to be unlawful for the magistrate
/ to go about to make any members for the body of Christ.

2 They hold all officers of the Church / to be members of the body / Romans
12.6. 1. cor. 12.8.28.

3 And therefore they hold the altering / or the abolishing of the offices of
church government / to be the altering and abolishing of the members of the
Church.

4 The altering and abolishing of which members / they hold to be unlawful /
because it must needs be a maime unto the body.

5 They hold Christ Jesus to have set down as exact / and as unchangeable a
church government / as ever Moses did. Heb. 3.6.

These and such like are the points they hold / let their cause be tried / and
if they hold any other points in effect but these / let them be hanged every
man of them.

Now I demand / whether they that hold the contrary in these points / and
cause the State to practice the contrary / be not outrageous wicked men / and
dangerous e / nemies of the state / it cannot be denied but they are. Because
the contrary practice of any the former points / is a way to work the ruin
of the state.

Now our Bishopps hold the contrary unto them al / save the 3. and 2. points /
whereunto it may be they will yield / and cause our estate to practice the
contrary: whence at the length / our destruction is like to proceed. For

1 They deny Christ Jesus to have set down as exact / and as unchangeable a
form of church government as Moses did. For they say / that the magistrate may
change the church government established by Christ / so could he not do that /
prescribed by Moses.

2 In holding all offices of the Church to be members of the body / (for if
they be not members / what should they do in the body) they hold it lawful for
the magistrate to attempt the making of new members for that body.

3 The altering or abollishing of these members by the magistrates / they hold
to be lawful. And therefore the maiming or deforming.

Now you wretches (Archb. and L. Bishops I mean) you Mar-state / Mar-law /
Mar-prince / Mar-maiestrat Mar-commonwealth / Mar-church / and Mar-religion Are
you able for your lives / to answer any part of the former syllogism /
whereby you are concluded / to be the greatest enemies unto her Majesty and
the State? You dare not attempt it I know. For you cannot deny / but they who
hold it and defend it lawful / (yea enforce the magistrate) to maime or
deforme the body of Christ / are utter enemies unto that magistrate / and that
state / wherein this disorder is practiced. You cannot deny your selves to do
this / unto our magistrate and State: because you bear them in hand / that a
lawful church government / may consist of those offices / which the magistrate
may abollishe out of the church without sin: and so / that the magistrate may
lawfully cut off the members of Christ from his body / and so may lawfully
massacre the body. You are then the men by whom our estate is most likely to
be overthrown / you are those that shall answer for our blood which the
Spaniard / or any other enemies are like to spil / without the Lords great
mercy: you are the persecutors of your brethren / (if you may be accounted
brethren) you and your hirelings are not only the wound / but the very plague
and pestilence of our church. You are those who maime / deforme / vex /
persecute / grieve / and wound the church. Which keep the same in captivity
and darkness / defend the blind leaders of the blind / slander / revile and
deforme Christ's holy government / that such broken and wooden members as you
are / may be still maintained / to have the romes of the true and natural
members of the body. Tell me I pray / whether the true and natural members of
the body may be lawfully cut of by the magestrate. If you should say they may /
I know no man would abide the spech. What? May the maiestrat cut of the true
and natural members / of the body of Christ? O impudency / not to be
tolerated. But our magestrate / that is her majesty / and our state / may
lawfully by your own confession / cut you of / that is displace you and your
offices out of our church. Deny this if you dare Then in deed it shall appear /
that John of Canturbury means to be a Pope in deed / and to have the
sovereignty over the civil magestrate. Then will you show your self in deed
/ to be Mar-prince / Mar-law and Mar-state. Now if the magestrate may displace
you as he may then you are not the true members. Then you are (as in deed you
ought) to be thrust out / unless the magestrate would incur the wrath of God /
for maiming and deforminge the body of the church / by joining unnatural
members thereunto.

Answer but this reason of mine / and then hang those that seek reformation /
if ever again they speak of it / if you do not / I will give you little quiet.
I fear you not. If the magestrate will be so ouerseene as to believe / that
because you which are the maim of the church are spoken against / therefore
they / namely our prince and state / which are Gods lieftenaunts / shall be in
like sort / dealt with / this credulity will be the magestrates sin. But I
know their wisdom to be such as they will not. For what reason is this / which
you profane T.C. have used. page 103.

The sinful / the unlawful / the broken / unnatural / false and bastardly
governors of the church / to wit archb. and bishops / which abuse even their
false offices / are spoken against. Therefore the true / natural and lawful /
and just governors of the commonwealth / shall be likewise shortly misliked. Ah
senseless and undutiful beasts / that dare compare your selves with our true
magestrates / which are the ordinances of God / with your selves / that is /
with Archbishops and bishops / which as you your selves confess (I will by and
by prove this) are the ordinances of the Devil.

I know I am disliked of many which are your enemies / that is of many which
you call puritans. It is their weakness / I am threatened to be hanged by you.
What though I were hanged / do you think your cause shall be the better. For the
day that you hang Martin / assure your selves / there will 20. Martins spring
in my place. I mean not now you gross beasts / of any commotion as profane
T.C. like a sensles wretch / not able to understand an English phrase / has
given out upon that which he calls the threatening of fistes. Assure your
selves / I will prove Marprelat ere I have don with you. I am alone. No man
under heaven is privy / or has bin privy unto my writings against you / I
used the advice of non therein. You have and do suspect diverse, as master
Paggett / master Wiggington / master Vdall / and master Penri / etc. to make
Martin. If they cannot clear their selves their silliness is pitiful / and
they are worthy to bear Martins punishment. Well once again answer my resons
/ both of your Antichristian places in my first epistle unto you / and these
now used against you. Otherwise the wisdom of the magistrate must needs smell
what you are. And call you to a reckoning / for deceauing them so long / making
them to suffer the church of Christ under their government to be maimed and
deformed.

Your reasons for the defense of your hierarchy / and the keeping out of
Christ's government / used by this profane T.C. are already answered. They show
what profane beasts you are. I will here repete them. But here first the
reader is to know what answer this T.C. makes unto the syllogismes / whereby
I prove all L. bishops to be petty popes / and petty Antichrists. I assure
you no other then this / he flattly denies the coiclusion / whereas he might
(if he had any learning in him / or had read any thing) know / that every
dunstical logician / gives this for an inviolable precept / that the
conclusion is not to be denied. For that must needs be true / if the mayor and
minor be true / he in omitting the mayor and minor / because he was not able to
answer thereby / grants the conclusion to be true. His answer unto the
conclusion is / that al lord Gb. were not pety popes. Because page 74. Cranmer
/ Ridly / Hooper / were not petty Popes. They were not pety popes / because
they were not reprobates. As though you block you / every petty pope and petty
Antichrist were a reprobate. Why no man can deny Gregory the great / to be a
pettye Pope / and a petty and petty Antichrist. For he was the next immediate
pope before Boniface the first / that known Antichrist: and yet this Gregory
left behind him / undoubted testimonies of a chosen child of God: so might
they / and yet be petty Popes / in respect of their office. Profane T.C. his
1. and 2. reason / for ye lawfulnes of our church government. And what though
good men gave their consent unto our church government / or writing unto
bishops / gave them their lordly titles? Are their offices therefore lawful /
then so is the popes office. For Erasmus was a good man you cannot deny / and
yet he both allowed of the popes office since his calling / and writing unto him
/ gave him his titles. So did Luther / since his calling also / for he
dedicated his book of christian liberty unto pope Leo the tenth. The book and
his Epistle unto the Pope / are both in English. Here I would wish the
magistrate / to mark what good reasons you are able to afford for your
hierarchy.

Thirdly / says profane T.C. page 75. All Churches have not the government of
Pastors and Doctors: but Saxoni and Denmake / have L. bishops. You are a great
State man undoubtedly T.C. that understand / the state of other Churches so
well. But herein the impudency of a proud fool appears egregiously. As
though the testimony of a siely Schoolmaster / being also as unlearned / as a
man of that trade and profession can be / with any honesty / would be believed
against known experience. Yea / but Saxony and Denmark have Superintendents
/ what then? ergo L. Archb. and bishops? I deny it. Though other Churches had
L. Archb. and Bb. this proves nothing else / but that other Churches are
maimed and have their imperfections. Your reason is this / other good Churches
are deformed / therefore ours must needs be so to. The kings son is lame /
therefore the children of no subjects must go upright. And these be all the
good reasons which you can bring for the government of Archb. and bishops /
against the government of Christ. You reason thus. It must not be admitted into
this kingdom / because then Ciuillians shall not be able to live / in that
estimation / and wealth / wherein they now do. Carnal and sensles beasts / who
are not ashamed to prefer / the outward estate of men / before the glory of
Christ's kingdom. Here again / let the magestrate and other readers consider /
whether it be not time / that such brutish men / should be looked unto. Which
reason thus. The body of Christ which is the church / must needs be maimed and
deformed in this commonwealth / because otherwise ciuillians should not be able
to live. Why you enemies to the state / you traitors to God and his word / you
Mar-prince / Mar-law / Mar-magestrate / Mar-church / and Mar-common wealth: do
you not know that the world should rather go a begging / then that the glory
of god by maiming his church / should be defaced? Who can abide this indignity.
The prince and state / must procure god to wrath against them / by continuing
the deformity of his church / and it may not be otherwise / because the
ciuilians else must fall to decay. I will tell you what / you monstrous and
ungodly bishops / though I had no fear of God before mine eyes / and had no
hope of a better life / yet the love that I owe / as a natural man / unto her
majesty and the state would enforce me to write against you: her majesty and
this kingdom / (whom the Lord bless / with his mighty hand / I unfeignedly
beseech) must endanger them selves under the peril of Gods heavy wrath / rather
then the maime of our church government must be healed / for we had rather it
should be so / say our bishops / then we should be thrust out / for if we
should be thrust out / the study of the civil law / must needs go to wrack.
Well / if I had lived sometimes a citizen / in that old and ancient (though
heathenish) Rome / and had heard king D^iotarus / Caesar / yea or Pompei
himself give out this spech / namely: that the city and empire of Rome must
needs be brought subject unto some danger / because otherwise / Catelin /
Lentulus / Cethegus / with other of the nobility / could not tell how to live
/ but must needs go a begging. I would surely / in the love I ought to the
safety of that state / have called him that had used such a speech / in
judicium capitis, whosoever he had bin: and I would not have doubted to have
given him the overthrow. And shall I being a christian English subject / abide
to hear a wicked crew of ungodly bishopps / with their hangones and parasites
/ affirm that our Queen / and our State / must needs be subject unto the
greatest danger that may be / vz. the wrath of God / for deforming his Church
/ and that Gods Church must needs be maimed and deformed among us / because
otherwise / a few Ciuillians shall not be able to live. Shall I hear and see
these things professed and published / and in the love I owe unto Gods
religion and her Majesty / say nothing. I cannot / I will not / I may not be
silent at this speech: come what will come of it. The love of a christian
Church / prince and state / shall I trust / work more in me / then the love of
a heathen Empire and state should do. Now judge good reader / who is more
tolerable in a commonwealth / Martin that would have the enemies of her
Majesty removed thence / or our bishops which would have her life / and the
whole kingdoms prosperity hazarded / rather then a few Ciuillians should want
maintenance. But I pray thee tell me T.C. why should the government of Christ
impouerish Ciuillians? Because says he / page 77. the Canon law by which they
live / must be altered / if that were admitted. Yea but Ciuillians live by the
court of Amraltie / and other courts as well as by the Arches / vz. also the
probatts of Testaments / the controversies of tithes / matrimony / and many
other causes / which you bishops Mar-state / do usurpingly take from the civil
magistrate / would be a means of Ciuillians maintenance. But are not you
ashamed / to profess your whole government / to be a government ruled by the
Popes Canon laws / which are bannished by statute out of this kingdom? This
notably shows that you are Mar-prince and Mar-state. For how dare you
retain these laws / unless by virtue of them / you mean either to enforce the
supremacy of the prince to go again to Rome / or to come to Lambeth. It is
treson by Statute / for any subject in this land / to proceed doctor of the
Cano^ law / and dare you profess your church government to be ruled by that
law. As though one statute might not refer all matters of the Canon law / unto
the temporal and common law of this Realm: and is this all you can say / T.C.

Yes says he / the government of Christ / would bring

The ministers maintenance by tithe / no puritan denies

The inconvenience which you show of the government unto Gods law / if the same
also were established by the law of the land / then to the Popes law and his
Canons. You think that all men are like your selves: that is / like bishops /
such as cannot choose but break the laws and good orders of God and her
Majesty.



T.C. this government seeks no popularity to be brought into the Church: much
less entendeth the alteration of the civil state / that is but your slander
/ of which you make an occupation. And I will surely pay you for it. I must be
brief now / but more warke for Cooper shall examine your slanders. They are
nothing else but prooffes / that as by your own confessions you are bishops of
the Devil / so you are enemies unto the state. For by these slanders / you go
about to blind our state / that they may never see a perfect regiment of the
Church in our days. I say / that by your own confession / you are bishops of
the Devil. I will prove it thus. You confess that your Lordly government /
were not lawful and tolerable in this commonwealth / if her Majesty and the
state of the land did disclaim the same. Tell me / do you not confess this.
Deny it if you dare. For will you say / that you ought lawfully to be here in
our commonwelth whether her Majesty and the Counsel will or no: Is this the
thanks that her Majesty shall have / for tollerating you in her kingdom all
this while / that now you will say / that you and your places stand not in
this kingdom by her courtesy / but you have as good right unto your places /
as she has unto her kingdom. And by this means your offices stand not by
her good liking / and the good liking of the state / as do the offices of our
L. high Chancellor / high Treasurer / and high Steward of England. But your
offices ought to stand and to be in force / in spite of her Majesty / the
Parliament / Counsel / and every man else / unless they would do you injury.
So that I know / I / you dare not deny but that your offices wear unlawful
in our common wealth / if her Majesty the Parliament / and the Counsel would
have them abollished. If you grant this / then you do not hold your offices as
from God / but as from man. Her majesty she holds her office / and her
kingdom / as from God / and is beholding for the same / unto no prince nor
state under heaven. Your case is otherwise / for you hold your offices as from
her Majesty / and not from god. For otherwise / you needed not to be any more
beholding unto her Majesty for the same in regard of right / then she is
bound to be beholding unto other states in regard of her right: and so you in
regard of your Lordly superiority / are not the bishops of god / but as Ierom
says / the bishops of man. And this the most of you confess to be true / and
you see how dangerous it would be for you / to affirm the contrary: namely /
that you hold your offices as from god. Well sir / if you say that you are the
bishops of man. The^ tell me whether you like of Dean John his book. T.C. 38.
O yes says T.C. For his grace did peruse that book / and we know the
sufficiency of it to be such / as the Puritans are not able to answer it.
Well then / whatsoever is in this book is authentical. It is so / says T.C.
otherwise / his grace would not have allowed it. What say you then to the 140.
page of that book / where he says / (answering the treatise of the bishop of
God / the bishop of Man / and the bishop of the Devil) that there is no
bishopp of man at all / but every B. must be either the Bishopp of God / or
the Bishop of the Devil. He also affirms / none to be the bishop of god / but
he which has warrant / both inclusiuely and also expressly in gods word. Deane
John, lib. 4. page 340. line 7.
Now you Bishops of the Devil / what say you now / are you spighted of the
Puritans / because you like good subjects dofend the laws of her Majesty / or
else because like incarnate Devils / you are bishops of the Devils / as you
your selves confess.

Here again / let the Magistrate once more consider / what pestilent and
dangerous beasts these wretches are unto the civil state. For either by their
own confession / they are the Bishops of the Devil (and so by that means will
be the undoing of the state / if they be continued therein) or else their places
ought to be in this commonwealth whether her Majesty and our state will or no:
because they are not (as they say) the bishops of man / that is / they have not
their superiority / and their Lordly callings over their brethren by humane
constitution / as my LL. Chancellor / Treasurer / and other honorable
personages have / but by divine ordinance. Yea / and their callings / they
hold (as you have heard) not only to be inclusiuely / but also expreslie in
the word. What shifte will they use to avoid this point? Are they the Bishopps
of men / that is / hold they their jurisdiction as from men. No says Deane
Gridges / no says John of Canterbury and the rest of them / (for all of them
allow this book of John Bridges) for then we are the bishops of the devil /
we cannot avoid it? Are they then the bishops of God / that is / have they such
a calling as the Apostles / Evangelists / etc. had: that is / such a calling
as ought lawfully to be in a christian common wealth (unless the magistrate
would injury the Church / yea maime / deforme / and make a monster of the
Church) whether the magistrate will or no. We have say they. For our callings
are not only inclusiuely / but also expressly in the word. So that by Deane
Bridges his confession / and the approbation of John Canterbury / either our
bishops are bishops of the devil / or their callings cannot be defended lawful
/ without flat and plain treason / in overthrowing her Majesty's supremacy.
And so Deane Bridges has written / and John Whitgift has approved and
allowed / flat treason to be published.

Is Martin to be blamed for finding out and discovering traitors? Is he to be
blamed for crying out against the Bb. of the Devil. If he be / then in deed
have I offended in writing against bishops? If not / whether is the better
subject Martin or our bishops: whether I be favored or no / I will not cease /
in the love I owe to her Majesty / to write against traitors / to write
against the Devils bishops. Our bishops are such by their own confession. For
they protest them selves to be bishopps of the Devil. If they should hold the
pre-eminence to be from man / If they hold it otherwise then from man / they
are traitors. And until this beast Docter Gridges wrote this book / they never
as yet durst presume to claim their Lordships any otherwise lawful then from
her majesty / yea and D. Bridges about the 60. page says the same. But they
care not what contrariety they have in their writings / what treason they hold
/ as long as they are persuaded that no man shall be tolerated to write against
them. I have once already showed treason to be in this book of the Deane of
Sarum / page. 448. I show the like now to be page 340. Because Deane Bridges
durst not answer me. They have turned unto me in his stead / a beast whom by
the length of his cares / I guess to be his brother / yt is / an Ass of the
same kind. But I will be answered of the Deane him self in this and the former
point of treason / or else / his cloister shall smoke for it. And thus profane
T.C. you perceue what a good subject you are / in defending the established
government. Thus also I have answered all your book in the matters of the
lawfulnes of the government by Pastors / Doctors / Elders and Deacons / and the
unlawfulness of our bastardly Church government / by archbishops and bishops /
where also the reader may see / that if ever there was a church rightly
governed / that is a church without maime or deformity / the same was governed
by Pastors / Doctors / elders and deacons.

when / when / but where have I bin all this while. Ten to one among some of
these puritans. Why Martin? Why Martin I say / have tow forgotten thy self?
Where have ti been / why man / cha bin a seeking for a Samons nest / and cha
vound a whole crew / either of ecclesiastical traitors / or of bishops of the
Devil / of broken and maimed members of the church: never wink on me good
fellow / for I will speak the truth / let the puritans do what they can. I
say then that they are broken members / and I say John of Canterbury if he be a
member of the church / I say he is a broken member / and that Thomas of
Winchester is a Choleric member. Yea and cha vound that profane T. C. is
afraid left her Majesty should give Bishops livings away from them. And
therefore shuts his book with this position / vz. That it is not lawful to
bestow such livings upon lay men / as are appointed by Gods law upon
ministers. But hereof more warke for Cooper shall learnedly dispute.

Reverend. T.C. Admonition page. 1. 2. 3.
We use the Ministers most vile now a days. God will punish us for it / as
he did those which abused his prophets.

Reverend Martin.
Look to it T.C. then. For out of thine own mouth shall thou be judged / thou
unrighteous servant. Our bishops are they which abuse the ministers. Our
bishopps were never good ministers as yet / and therefore they are not to be
compared with the prophets.

Reverend. T.C. Page. 4.
Some men will say / that I do great injury to the prophets and apostles / in
comparing our Bishops unto the^. But we may be happy if we may have tolerable
ministers in this perilous age.

Reverend Martin.
I hope T.C. that thou do not mean to serve the church with worse then we
have: what worse then John of Canterbury? worse then Tom Tubtrimmer of
Winchester? worse then the vickers of Hell / sir Iefferie Jones / the parson of
Micklain / etc. I pray thee / rather the^ we should have a change from evil to
worse / let us have the evil still. But I care not if I abide ye venture of the
change. Therefore get John with his Canterburinesse / removed / etc. (whom
thou acknowledgest to be evil) and I do not doubt / if worse come in their
stead / but the devil will soon fetch them away / and so we shall be quickly rid
/ both of evil and worse. But good T.C. is it possible to find worse then we
have. I do not marvel though thou call me libeller / when thou dare abuse
the Prophets far worse / then in calling the^ libeliers: for I tell thee true
/ thou could not have any way so stained their good names / as thou have
done / in comparing them to our bishopps. Call me Libeller as often as thou will / I do not greatly care: but and thou love me / never liken me to our
bishops of the devil. For I cannot abide to be compared unto those. For by
thine own comparison / in the 9. page / they are just Balaams up and down.

Reverend T.C. page 8. 9. 10.
Though our bishops be as evil as Judas / the false Apostles / and Balaam / yet
because they have sometimes brought unto us Gods message / we must think no
otherwise of them / then of Gods messengers. For God will not suffer devilish
and Antichristian persons to be the chief restorers of his gospel.

Reverend Martin.
First T.C. I have truly gathered thine argument / though thou namest neither
Judas nor the false apostles. Prove it otherwise. Then have thou reverend
Martin / proved thy self a liar. Now secondly then seeing it is so / I pra^e
thee good honest T.C. desire our Iudasses (who was also one of the first
Apostles) not to sell their master for money / desire our false Apostles (who
preached no false doctrine for the most part) not to insult over poor Paul /
and desire our good Balaams / not to follow the wages of unrighteousness. The
counsel is good. For Judas / though one of the first publishers of the gospel
(so were not our bishops in our time) yet hung himself. The false apostles had
their reward / I doubt not. And Balaam / as soon as ever the Israelites took
him / was justly executed for his wickedness. The forced blessing wherewith he
blessed the^ saved him not.

Reverend T.C. page 10. 11. 12. 13.
May coniecturall speeches fly abroad of bishops / as that they are covetous /
give not to the poor / hinder reformation / Simoniacks / etc. but the chief
governors ought to take heed / that they give no credit to any such things.
I trust never any of them / committed idolatry as Aharon did.

Reverend Martin.
Yea / I beseech you that are in authority in any case / not to believe any
truth against our bishops. For these puritans (although the bishops grant
themselves / to be as evil as Balaam) could never yet prove the good
fathers / to have committed idolatry as Aharon did. And as long as they be no
worse then Balaam was / there is no reason why they should be disliked. You
know this is a troublesome world / men cannot come unto any meare living
without friends. And it is no reason why a man should trouble his friend and
give him nothing / a hundred pounds and a gelding / is yet better then
nothing. To b^w^e but seven days in a week / is a very tolerable recreation.
You must know / that John of London / has sometimes preached (as this profane
T.C. has given out to his no small commendations) thrice in a year at Paul's
cross. A sore labor / it is reason that he should bestow the rest of they
care / in maintaining his health by recreation / and providing for his family:
give him leave but to keep out the government of the Church / to swear like a
swag / to persecute / and to take some small ten in the hundred: and truly he
will be loath ever to commit idolatry as Aharon did. I hope / though Judas
sold his master / yet that it cannot be proved since his calling / that ever
he committed idolatry.

Reverend T.C. page 16. 17.
Though bishops should offend as Noah did in drunkenness / yet good children
should cou^r their fathers falts. For natural children / though they suffer
injuries at their fathers hands / yet they take their griefs very mildely.

Reverend Martin.
Bishop Westphaling. But what then? Parson Grauat parson of sir John Pulchres
in London (one of dumb John's housing mates) will be drunk but once a week.
But what then? good children should take linkes in a cold morninge and light
them at his nose / to see if by that means some part of the fire that has so
flashed his sweet face / might be taken away: this were their duty / says
T.C and not to cry read nose / redd nose. But T.C. what if a man should
find him lying in the kenill / whether should he take him up (all to be
mired like a swore) in the sight of the people and ^ary him home on his back
or fling a cover (...) him / and let him there take his rest / until his legs
would be advised by him to carry him home. But me thinks brother T.C. you
defend the bishops but (...) fauoredly in these points. For you do / as
though a chief should say to a true man / I must needs have thy purse / thou
must bear with me / it is my nature / I must needs play the thief. But yet
thou dealest uncharitably with me / if thou blasest it abroad: for though I
make an occupation of theft / yet charity would cover it. So say you / though
our bishops make a trade of persecuting and depriving Gods ministers / though
they make a trade of continuing in Antichristian callings / yet charity would
have their faltes covered / and have them mildely dealt with. As though T.C.
there were no difference / betwixt those that fall by infirmity into some one
sin / not making it their trade / and not defending the same to be lawful /
and our bishops which continue in an Antichristian calling / and occupation /
and defend they may do so. But will they leave think you / if they be mildly and
gently dealt with. The^ good John of Canterbury / I pray thee leave thy
persecuting: good John of Canterbury leave thy Popedom: good father John of
London / be no more a bishop of the Devil: be no more a traitor to God and his
word. And good sweet boys / all of you / become honest men: maime and deform
the church no longer: sweet fathers now / make not a trade of persecuting:
gentle fathers keep the people in ignorance no longer: good fathers now /
maintain the dumb ministry no longer. Be the destruction of the Church no
longer / good sweet babes now: leave your Nonresidencie / and your other
sins / sweet Popes now: and suffer the truth to have free passage. Lo T.C.
now I have mildely dealt with the good fathers / I will now expecte a while /
to see whether they will amend by fair means / if not / let them not say but
they have bin warned.

Reverend T.C. from the 20. to the 30.
Though the bishops be faltie / yet they are not to be excused that find falt
with them for synister ends. And the prince and magistrates / is to take heed
that by their suggestions / they be not brought to put down L. bishops / to
take away their livings / and put them to their pensions. For the putting of
them to their pensions / would discourage young students from the study of
divinity.

Reverend. Martin.
I thought you were afraid to loose your livings / by the courtier Martins
means. But brethren fear it not. I would not have any true minister in the
land / want a sufficient living. But good souls / I commend you yet / that are
not so bashful / but you will show your griefs. Is it the treading under foot
of the glory of God / that you fear good men. No no say they / we could
resonably well bear that loss. But we dye if you deminish the alowance of our
Kitchen. Let us be assured of that / and our Lordly callings / and we do not
greatly care / how other matters go. I will when more work is published /
help those good young students unto a means to live / though they have none of
your Bishopdomes / if they will be ruled by me.

Reverend. T.C. page. 5 36.
There have been within these few weeks. 3. or 4. pamphlets published in
print / against bishops. The author of them calls him self Martin / etc.

R. Martin.
But good Tom Tubtrimmer / if there have bin 3. or 4 published / why does
bishop Cooper name on only / why does he not confute all? why does he invent
objections of his own / seeing he had 3. books more to confute / or 2. at
least then he has touched / nay / why does he not confute one of them
thoroughly / seeing therein his Bishopdome was reasonably caperclawed I have
only published a Pistle / and a Pitomie / wherein also I grant that I did
reasonably Pistle them. Therefore T.C. you begin with a lie / in that you say
that I have published either 3. or 4. books.

Reverend. T.C. page. 38.
His grace never felt bl^w as yet / etc. What is he past seeking will thou tell
me that T.C he sleeps belike in the top of ye roust. I would not be so well
thwacked for the popedom of Canter. as he has borne poor man. He was never
able to make good syllogism since I am sure. He allowed D. Bridges his book
quoth T.C. I pray thee what got he by that / but a testimony against him self
/ that either he has allowed treason / or confessed him self to be the bishop
of the Devil.

T.C. page. 38. He that reads his grace his answer / and M. Cartwrights
reply / shall see which is the better learned of the twoe. So he shall in deed
T.C. and he were very simple which could not discern that. And there is so
much answered already as thou faist / that his grace dare answer no more for
shame. And T.C. you your selves grant T. Cartwright to be learned / so did I
never think John Whitgift to be / what comparison cann you make between them?
But Thomas Cartwright / shall I say / that thou made this book against me /
because T.C. is set to it well take heed of it / if I find it to be thy doing /
I will so besoop thee / as thou never bangedst John Whitgift better in thy
life. I see here that they have quarrelled with thee Water Trauerse / John /
Penri / Thomas Spark / Giles Wiggington / Master Dauison / etc. Nay it is no
matter / you are even well served / this will teach you I trow to become my
chaplains. For if you were my chaplains once / I trow John Whitgift / nor any
of his / durst not once say black to your eyes. And if I had thy learning
Thomas Cartwright / I would make them all to smoke. But though I were as very
an Asschoad as John Catercap is / yet I could deal well enough with clergy
men: yea with old Winken de word D. Prime his self. And i will bepistle you D.
Prime / when I am at more leisure / though in deed I tell you true / that as
yet I do disdain to deal with a contemptible trencher chaplain / such as
you / D. Bankcroft / and Chaplain Duport are. But ise be with you all three to
bring one day / you shall never escape my fingers / if I take you but once in
hand. You see how I have dealt with Deane John / your entertainment shall be
alike. But Thomas Cartwright / thou art T.C. so is Tom Cooper too. The
distinction then / between you both / shall be this: he shall be profane T. C.
because he calls Christ Jesus / by whom the government by Pastors / Doctors /
Elders and Deacons was commanded / to be he knows not whom: and thou shall be
simple T.C.

Concerning Mistress Lawson / profane T.C. is it not lawful for her to go to
Lambeth by water / to accompany a preachers wife / going also (as commonly
godly matrons in London do) with her man: Qui pergit quod vult dicere quae non
vult audiet.
No says T.C. I do not like this in women. Tushe man / Thomas Lawson is not
Thomas Cooper / he has no such cause to doubt of Dame Lawsons going without
her husband / as the bishop of Winchester has had of dame Coopers gadding But
more work for Cooper / will say more for Mistress Lawson.

From whom soever Charde had his protection / his Face is glad of it / for
otherwise he knows not how to get a printer / for the established government
/ because the books will not sell.

Touching the Praemunire / let the Libeller and his / do what he dare. T.C.
page 40.
Why brethren / what wisdom is this in you to dare your betters? do you not
know that I can find you my mind by a Pistle / and then prove you to be
petty Popes / and enemies to the State. And how can you mend your selves. It
is certain you are in a praemunire. If her Majesty will give me leave to have
the law / I will be bound to bring 10000. pounds into her coffers upon that
bargain. And therefore foolish men / dare your betters no more. And here I pray
thee mark how I have made the bishops to pull in their horns. For whereas in
this place / they had printed the word dare, they bethought themselves / yt
they had to deal with my worship / which am favored at the Court / and being
afraid of me / they pasted the word can upon the word dare, and so / where
before they bad me and mine do what we durst: now they bid us do what we can /
hoping thereby to have a frinde in a corner / who would not suffer us to do
what we ought and durst: and so our ability should not be according unto
their demerit. Mark now / ye bishopps of the Devil / whether you be not
afraid of me: I will see you iolled with the Praemunire one day.

The like thing you shall find in the 135. page. For there having said / that
they will not deny the discipline to have been in the Apostles time / they have
now pasted there upon that / That is not yet proved. So that although their
consciences do tell them / that the discipline was then / yet they will bear
the world in hand / that that is not yet proved. Here you see that if this
patch T.C. had not used two patches to cover his patcherie / the bishops would
have accounted him to be as very a patch as Deane John.

A / but these knave puritans are more unmannerly before his grace / then the
recusaunts are / and therefore the recusants have more favor. I cannot blame
them / for we ought to have no popes. The papists likes the Archiepiscopall
Pall / and therefore reuerenceth a petty Pope therein. And though the recusant
come not to hear the sermons / yet he is an informer very often / upon other
men's information.

His grace denies that ever he hard of any such matter / as that the Jesuit
should say / he would become a brave Cardinal / if popery should come again. I
know T.C. that long since he is past shame / and a notorious liar / otherwise
how durst he deny this / seeing Cliffe an honest and a godly cobbler / dwelling
at Battle bridge / did justify this before his grace his teethe / yea and will
justify the same again if he be called. So will Atkinson too. page. 41.
page 46. page. 44.
Send for them if he dare. Ministers of the Gospel ought to be called priests /
says his grace / what say you by that? Then good sir John O Cant. when will thou say Mass at our house. His grace is also persuaded / that there ought to
be a Lordly superiority among ministers. So was Judas persuaded to sell his
master. If you would have these things proved / profane T.C. refers you
to his grace his answer unto simple T.C. and to doctor Bridges. That is / if
you would learn any honesty / you must go to the stews / or if you would
have a good savor / you must go to the sincke for it. Why thou vnsauorly
snuff / do tow think that men know not D. Bridges and John Whitgift. Yea
but his grace also firmly believes / that Christ in soul descended into
Hell. This is the 3. point of his catholic persuasion: but tell him from me /
that he shall never be saved by this belief / and my finger in his mouth. Let
him tell what our savior Christ should do / if he did not harrow Hell. Where
thou say M. Young had only the dealing with Thakwel the popish printer /
without his graces priuitie / thou lie in thy throat: M. Young him self
brought him to his grace / who ordered the matter as it is set down in my
Pistle. But did not I say truly of thee / yt thou can cog / face and lie /
as fast as a dog can trot / and that thou have a right seasoned wainscoate face
of ti nowne / chwarnt tee / ti vorehead zaze hard as horn.

Concerning Walde-graue / its no matter how you deal with him / heez a foolish
fellow / to suffer you to spoil his press and letters: an a had bin my
worships printer / i would a kept him from your clouches. And yet it is pity to
belie the devil: and therefore you shall not belie / him and go scotfree. As
for the press that Walde-graue sold / he did it by order / vz. He sold it to
an allowed printer / I.C. one of his own company / with the knowledge of his
Warden / Henry Denham / etc. And call you this favor / in releasing him after
long imprisonment? But I will give you a president of great favor in deed /
wherein you may see what an ungrateful fellow Walde-graue is to his grace / who
has bin so good unto him from time time. There being a controversy between
another printer and Walde-graue (all matters of printing being committed by the
LL. of the Counsel to his grace) Walde-graue made one of his company his
friend (who could do much with his grace) to deal for him / who brake the
matter to his worship / being at Croydon in his Orcharde: so soon as the
party named Walde-graue / he sweetly answered him / saying: if it had bin
any of the company save him / he would have granted the suite / but in no case
to Walde-graue. Well Walde-graue / obtained the R. H. Lord Treasurers letter in
his behalf to his grace / who when he had read it / said / I will answer my L.
Treasurer: with that Walde-graue entreated for his favorable letter to the
Wardens of his company / which in the end through D. Coosins he obtained
(though late) yet went home at night / thinking to deliver it in the morning:
but before he was ready / the Wardens were with him / and rested him with a
Purciuant upon his graces commandment / Walde-graue telling them there was a
letter from his grace / which he received late the last night at Croidon: who
answered / they knew it well enough / but this is his pleasure now: so they
carried Walde-graue to prison / and in this / his grace was so good unto him /
as to help him with an hundred marks over the shulders. A new revenge for an
old grudge.
If this be your favor / God keep me from you / ka M. Marprelate. Bishops
have justly received according to their deserts / having found greater favor
at my worships hands the^ ever they deserved / being notorious / disobedient
and godless persons / unthrifty spenders and consumers of the fruits / not of
their own labors / (as you say Walde-graue was) but of the possessions of the
church / persons that have violated their faith to god / his church / her
majesty / and this whole kingdom / and wittingly bring us al without the great
mercy of god to our undoing: so that our wives / children and servants have
cause to curse al L. Bb. Lo T.C. you see that I have a good gift in imitation /
and me thinks I have brought your words into a marvelous good sense / where
as before in the cause of Walde-graue / they were ilfauoredly wrested: and as
for his wife and children / they have just cause to curse John of London / and
John of Canterbury / for their tyrannizing over him: by imprisoning and
spoiling his goods / and vexing his poor wife and children / with continual
rifeling his house with their purciuants: who in November last / violently
rusht into his house / breaking through the maine wall thereof after midnight /
taking away his goods / for some of the purciuants sold his books up and down
the streats / to watchmen and others. Ah you Antichristian prelates / when will
you make an end of defending your tyranny / by the blood and rapine of her
majesty's subjects? You have bin the consumers of the fruits of Walde-graues
labors: for have you not sent him so often to prison / that it seemed you made
a common occupation thereof? For as soon as any book is printed in the defense
of Christ's holy discipline / or for yt detecting of your Antichristian dealings
/ but your ravening purciuantes fly city and country to seek for
Walde-graue / as though he were bound by statute unto you / either to make
known who printed seditious books against my L. Face / or to go to prison
himself / and threatened with the rack. O the greatness of his graces favor.
And are you not ashamed to say / that he ever violated his faith? you know well
enough / that he is neither Archb. nor L.B. The case thus stood / after he had
remained a long time in prison / not that time when Hartwell his graces
secretary wished that his grace might never eat bit of bread after he released
him. Nor at that time when you profane T.C. to^^ him / that all puritans had
traitorous hearts. Nor at that time Wald-graue told his grace / that he was
worse the^ Boner in regard of the time. Nor that time when he was straungely
released by one of the Lord of good Londons Swans. Neither was it at yt time /
when his grace (good conscionable noble man) violated his promise / in that he
told the wardens of the staciouers / that if Walde-graue would come quietly to
him / and cease printing of seditious books / he would pardon what was past /
and the wardens promised his wife / that if he were committed / they would lie
at his graces gate til he were released / and for all this / yet he was
committed to the white Lion / where he lay six weeks. Nor it was not at that
time / when his grace allowed Watson the purciuant / to take of Walde-graue /
13. s. 4. pence / for cariyng of him to the white Lion. But it was that time /
when his grace kept him 20. weeks together in the white lion / for printing
the Complaint of the comminaltie / the Practice of prelates / A learned man's
judgment / etc. Means being used for his liverty / his freud who was bound for
him told him / his liberty was obtained in manner following. You must be bound
says he / in a 100. pounds / to print no more books herafter / but such as
shall be authorized by her Majesty or his grace / or such as were before lawfully
authorized: whereunto he answered / that it was not possible for him to contain
himself within the compass of that bond / Whereby it may appear he swore not
to his friend.
neither should his consent ever go to the same (the same will D. Coosins witness
(that maidenly Doctor / who sits cheek by ioll with you) if he will speak a
truth / which words Walde-graue uttered to him / going in the old pallas at
westminster with his keeper before he was released) yet he would gladly have
his liberty if he might lawfully. For said he / I being a poor workman to
my company / cannot possibly observe it. For many books heretofore printed /
had cum priuilegio, and yet were never authorized: and again / that it were
but a folly for him to sue to her Majesty / the office were very base and
unfit for her. And he might be well assured that Caiphas of Cant. would never
authorize any thing for his behoof / and so it fell out. And thus Martin has
proved you in this / as in all other things / to be liars. And what is it that
you Bb. and your hangones will not say by Walde-graue / whom you would hang if
you could. I will be brief in the rest / but so / as reader may perceive that
T.C. was hired to lie by commission.

I will stand to it / that his grace accounts the preaching of the word /
being the only ordinary means of salvation to be an heresy / and does
mortally persecute the same: page. 46.
page. 47.
his appellation to the obedient clergy shall stand him in no steed / when
more work for Cooper / is published. And there I will pay thee for abusing M.
Wiggington / and Master Dauison / whose good names can take no stain / from a
bishops chopps. page. 47.
If his grace rejected Master Euans for want of conformity / why is the quare
impedit gotten against the bishopp of Worcester / by the noble Earl of Warwick
his patron. I hope he will see both the quare impedit, and the praemunire to /
brought upon the bones of father Edmond of Worcester. page. 48. 49.
It is a common brag with his grace his parasites / and with him self / that
he is the second person in the land. More work shall pay his grace for
commending the Apocripha a profane and a lying storye in many places / to be
unseperably joined with the holy word of God. 2: Esdras. 14.21.37. etc.
You grant D. Spark to have set his grace and your self T.C. at a non plus,
page. 50,
for the septuaginta is contrary to the Hebrew / and therefore / you maintain
contrary translations / and require men to aproue both. Martin has marred
Richard patriks market / for otherwise he was in good hope to have a benefice
at his grace his hand / and to be made a minstrell. Shameless and impudent
wretches that dare deny John of Ca^t. to have bin at any time under D. Perne /
but as a fellow of the house / where he was master / whereas all the world
knows him to have bin a poor scholar in that house / yea and his grace has
often confessed / that he being there a poor scholar / was so poor as he
had not a napkin to wipe his mouth / but when he hadd gotten some fat meat of
O the fellows table / would go to the skrine / and first wipe his mouth on the
on side and then O the other / because he wanted a napkin / judge you whether
this be not a meaner state / then to carry a cloakbag / which is not spoken to
vpbraide any man's poverty / but to pull the pride of Gods enemy / an ase lower.
Although we cannot believe D. Perne in the pulpit / yet in this point we will
not refuse his testimony. I am gladd John of London you will not deenie / but
you have the Diars cloth / make restitution then: page. 51. 52. 53. 54.
thou made the porter of thy gate a minister John / and thou might do it
lawfully. Why so I pray thee / why man / because he was almost blind / and at
Paddington being a small people / he could not starve as many souls / as his
master does / which has a great charge. page. 55. 56.
I hope M. Madox will think scorn / to ask John of London forgiveness. The
substance of the tale is true. I told you that I had it at the second hand. Are
you not ashamed / to deny the elmes to be cut down at Fulham? Why her
majesty's taker took them from John of London. And simple fellows / are you
not able to discern between a pleasant frump given you by a counselor / and a
spech used in good earnest. Alas poor John O London / do thou think / that
M. Vicechamberlain spoke as he thought. Then it is time to beg thee for
aswagg. And so it is if thou think we will believe the turncoate D. Perne
speaking unto us in his own name / who like an Apostatae / has out of the
pulpit / told so many untruths. And as it is as lawful to boule / O the
Sabbath / page. 57. 58.
as it is to eat / and for you to make dumb ministers as it was for David to
eat of the show bread page 110. or for the Machabees to fight on the Sabbath /
or for Moses to grant a bil of diuorcement? I perceive these men will have the
good divinity / if it be to be gotten for money. page. 62.
Yea and our Savior Christ / swear by his faith very often. How so good John.
I never hard that before / why says T.C. he said Amen Amen very often / and
Amen / is as much as by my faith / page. 62. horrible and blasphemous beasts /
whither will your madness grow in a while / if you be not restrained. M. Allen
the Grocer is paid all save 10. pound: page. 58.
for the use of that / the executors have John O Londons blessing. And I think
they are reasonably well served. page. 59,
If the tale of Benison be not true / why was John of London allotted by the
counsel / to pay him (I think) 40. pounds for his false imprisonment. John of
London is not dumb / because he preaches sometimes thrice a year at Paul's
cross. Then we shall never make our money of it I see. page. 6. 61, 62.
But I pray thee T.C. how can thou excuse his blaspeemie / of Eli, Eli,
lammasabackthani: there have bin 2. outrageous facts amongst others committed
in the world / by those that profess true religion / the on was the betraying
of our savior by Judas an apostle / the other was the horrible mocking of his
agony and bitter passion / by John Elmar a bishop in this speech. If he had
been in some reformed Churches / the blaspheemer would have hardly escaped
with his life. And is it true sweet boy in deed? Has Leicestorshiere so
embraced the Gospel without contention / and that by Dumb John's means? Little
do thou know what thou have done now / how if Martin be a Leycester shiere
man / have not thou then set out the praise of thine own bane? For martin I
am sure / has wroght your Caiphas Chair more wrack and misery / then all the
whole land beside. And therefore thou see / a man may be so madd sometimes /
that he may praise he cannot tell what. The bishop of Rochester in presenting
him self to a parsonage / did noe more then law allowed him. page. 63,
And do so again good John of Rochester / and it will be for thy credit. Fo /
these puritans would find fault I think with John of Cant. (if he believing
that Christ in soul went to Hell) should hold it unlawful for a man to pray
unto Christ being in hell. And sweet John of Cant. if ever thou praiedst in
thy life for any bodies souls / now pray for thy brother D. Squire and
Tarletons souls. They were honest fellows / though I think dean John's ears be
longer. For why good sweet John / may not your worship do this / as well as
William of Lincoln might pray / that our souls should be with the souls of
professed traitorous papists. page. 63. 64.


The good B. of Winchester did not protest / that at sir M. Oueries which was
laid to his charge / but he spoke some things that way. page. 14. 65. 66. etc.
Well brother Winchester / you confess the most part / and we will believe the
rest for your sake without witness. page. 71.
The B. of Winchester never said that it was an heresy / to hold that the
preaching of the word was the only ordinary means to salvation / but inasmuch
as Penri held that the effect of salvation could not be wrought by the word
read / he said that was not far from heresy: why brother Cooper / what is this
else but open confession. For John Penri as appears in his writings holds
the word read / to be no ordinary means of salvation at al. This I know you will
account an heresy / otherwise your case is damnable / that cause the people to
content themselves with reading / and hold that they may ordinarily be saved
thereby. page. 72. 75.
Yea but T. of Winchester disputed a M. of Art / 45. year ago in divinity.
Here is an old lad once. I hope that disputation was very cholerickly
performed. And he did once as pretty a thing as that came to. For once preaching
at Canter. he was disposed to note out T.C. I mean simple T.C. in his sermon /
his part he played after this sort. He noted 4. great Hidraes of the gospel in
his sermon. 1. Carnal security. 2. Heathnish gentility. 3. Obstinat papistrie
/ 4. says he / when I look in his forehead / I find T. C. written therein /
which I cannot otherwise interpret / then thankles curiosity / thanklesse for
the benefits already received / and more curious then needs in vain and needles
questions. The old stude^t did not know himself to be T.C. when he thus spoke
/ and this is ye thankles curiosity yt has answered Martin. Yea and he saw
martins picture drawn when he was a young man. I perceive then he was not blind
/ as the old porter of Paddington / whom John of London be deaconed and
beminstrelled. Lucian of Winchester himself was Nje painter. Mydas of Cant.
the judge. The one of the 2. women caled ignorance / was the good wife of Bath
/ D. Culpable warden of new college / ye other called ielious suspicion / was
ye fox John of Exetor. The^ came in Winkendeword / allas D. Prime callumniator.
This Winken and his L. of Winchester / drew innotencie: to wit / Martin
Marprelat gentleman by the hair of the head. Then followed Dolus fraus
insidiae. To wit / D. Perne / D. Kenold and D. Cosins. The treader was cankered
malice / his eyes were fiery / his face thinn and withered / pined away with
melancholi / and this was D. Copcoat. Then followed dolfull repentance / yt is
/ dean John / repenting that ever he had written in the Bb. behalf / because
his grace is not as good as his word. T.C. consider this picture until we
meet again. Now my business calls me away / I am traveling toward Banbury /
for I here say that there has bin old ado. For bakers daughters would have
knights whether they would or no. I will learn the truth hereof / and and so I
will post to Solihill / and visiting some parts of Stafford / Warwick / and
Northampton shires / I will make a journey back again to Norfolk and
suffolk: I have a register at Bury / and by that time my visitors will be
come out of Cornwall / Deuon and Hampshire. And now fare thee well good profane
T.C. I cannot now meddle with the long period which thou have in the 33. 34.
page of thy book / it is but 38. lines: thou art longer wided then Deane John
is I see / though he has longer periods then that which I set down. Whereas
thou do complain that the livings of our bishopps are so small / that some
of their children are like to go a begging. There is a present remedy for that.
For to what end else / is John of Cant. unmarried / but to provide for the
bishops children who shall be poorly left. Though in deed / I never said in my
life / that there was ever any great familiarity (though I know there was some
acquaintance) between mistress Toye and John Whitgift. And i will befie em / i will
befie em that will say so of me. And wherefore is Richard of Peterborowe
unmarried / but to provide for other men's children. O now I remember me / he has
also a charge to provide for / his hostess and cousin of Sibson. The peticoat
which he bestowed upon her / within this six months was not the best in
England / the token was not unmeet for her state. Farewell / farewell /
farewell old Martin / and keep thee out of their hands for all that. For
thou art a shrewd fellow / thou will one day overthrow them Amen. And then
thou swearest by thy faith / quoth John of London.
