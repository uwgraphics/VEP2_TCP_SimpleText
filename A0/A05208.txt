The.iiii. leaves of the trueloue

woodcut Hold this a token (...)

for your sake
I shall it take


IN a morning of may wha^ meadows ca^ spry^ge.
Branches and blossoms of bright colors
As I went by a well on my playenge
Through a merry orcharde saying mine ours
Where birds full bysely began for to sing
The bows to borge on board to the brows
I was ware of a may that made morning
She sat and syghed among the fair flowers
so sweet
She made mourning enough
Her weeping did my heart woo
To a derne I me droughe
Her will for to know
Stylly I stalked and stood in that stead
To wit of her will and of her wild thought
Then cast she her kercheffes the call of head
Wrong she her hands and wrothly she wrought
She said mylde mary right thou my read
Of all the welthe of the world would I naught
But send me some solase or sone I shall be deed
A syghte of that selcath I have it long sought
with care
Then spoke the turtyll on a tree
With fair words and free
Bright bird of bewte
Why syghest thou so sore
O fair foul spare not thy speech nor thy spell
They kerpynge does me comfort to harken and bear
All my will and my thought would I the tell
My woe and my wandrynge and thou would come nere
Then he lyghted lovely with her for to dwell
To comfort the comely and ever her chere
She blyssyd his body with book and with bell
And loved our lady that sent her that fere
so fre
When I was sorry
Besought I our lady
And she sent me company
Blessed may she be
O fair foul full of love so mylde and sweet
To meddle on a matter now we may begin
Trueloue I have sought fer by way and bystrete
In many fair orchardes where flowers be in,
So far as I have sought saw I none yet
Full few I have found of more or ot mine
Bright bird of ble my sorrow might thou beat
Would thou me wysshe wisely a trueloue to win
with right
For when I wene sonest
To find love best
Then so feeble is it fest.
And fares all on flight
The wit of wymen is wonder to here
Is all thy sorry syghynge to seek a love true
All thy life days may thou seek and never none be nere
But if thou had counsel of one that I knew
If thou beset to seek trueloue I shall the lere
Where it is spryngynge evermore new
Without any fautynge full fair and full clear
Or casting of colors or chaungynge of hew
full yare
I dare baldly say
Three is no love that lasts aye
Without treason or traye.
But if it begin there
Look where thou fyndest growyng a truloue gresse
That with.iiij. leaves fully is set about
The first lefe we may lyken to the king of bliss
He that wrought all the world with in and without
He made heaven with his hand and all paradyse
And this merry mydell earth without any doubt
All the welthe of the world holly is his
In whom we ought to live and low for to loute
full well
Hold we this in mind
Till we may these felawes find
The true love and kind.
That neuermore shall kele
The second lefe of ye trueloue I lyken to gods sone
That to the first lefe is felawe and fere
The third to the holy ghost together they wone
All hole in a godhede and persons three
They be rulers of water son and of moan
The fourth lefe of price without any pere
When the comely king is set in his trone
Comely of colors and curteyse of chere
with grace
All this world he began
And of wyndes and waters wan
Then he marked man
After his own face
First he made Adam and than he made Eve
He put them in to paradyse in great degree
Forbyddynge nothing to him and his wife
But a grene apple that did grow on a tree
Than sorry sathanas sought them belyfe
To awake our woe cursed might he be
Then took they the apple that styred much strife
The foul fend was glad that sight for to se
for tene
The first leave was woe
When flowers fell him fro
That his friends should to hell go
For an apple grene
Then began the first lefe to mourn for us all
For his holy handy work that was forlorn
Gabryell to him he did call
Forth came he comely and kneled him beforne
He said to mylde mary on message thou shall
To bear her glad tidings of her I will be borne
Thus he sent his sone out of his hye halle
To the mylde maid on a merry morn
and her great
Gabryell with the fair face
Said mary full of grace
Pyerles in every place
With mirth thou art met
Thou salt conceive a child comely and clear
All the bale of the world in the it shall be let
She said yt were a marvel and I a child should bear
For I was never married with no man yet
He said behold to thy cosyn yt has conceived to year
Elyzabeth in her age that long has been led
O lord I am thy maid said mary so dear
And holy in thy service is my heart set
full still
Blyssed be the sweet wight
That gods sone in light
Become man full of might
With the faders will
Now is the second lefe for our love most
Light in the lady that gabryell great
Without any treason true for to tryst
With myrthe in a maid is god and man met
This is the fader and the son and the holy ghost
Three lefes of love without any let
The fourth is a maid chosen for chaste
Such another truloue was never in land set
for bote
The fourth lefe may never fall
But ever they spring shall
So gentely they Join all
On a rich root
Now has the third lefe a sweet fellow taken
For love in lady is our lady light
Joseph her wedded and with her did gone
In the cite of bethelem there builded the bright
Between an ox and an awe pride was there none
A blessed child there was borne on crystmas night
There rose a sterre stabely showed and shone
Three king of colayne thereon had a sight
and sought
They offered to him as they would
Myrre Rykyls and gold
He thanked them many fold
And to bliss he them brought
Unhappy Herod the tidings herd tell
That a child was borne that king should be
He did make messagers and send them full snell
To slay all male children in that country
They left none alive but all did they kill
They spytted the^ on spear points great pity was to se
Joseph with his wedded wife would no longer dwell
But led her in to Egypt with her leaves three
for to save
The children could their death take
For the trueloue sake
More myrthe they did make
For him self would they have
Yet would our lord do more for his friends dear
For his holy handy works to hell would he gone
To give ensample his law for to lere
Saint Johan crystened him in flome iordane
For xxx. pens was he sold through a false fere
Unto the Jews that would him have slain
All he suffered for our sake and himself was clear
By a kiss was he known and sone was be taken
also
It was great pity for to se
When he should blenke of his ble
The second lefe of the three
The fourth was full woo
Pylate was Iustyse and spoke up on hye
For to deem Ihesu that Judas has sold
He said look lords truth for to try
The semly is fautles say what they would
The Iues on pylate began for to cry
He calls himself a king such bourdes be to bold
If thou will not deem him to day for to dye
Loud before the emperor the tale shall be told
for dread
A fury dome he gave him there
And said that he could say no more
I read ye take him there
And forth ye him led
Alas for the fourth lefe was left alone
When her fair fellowship was taken and torn
Beten which sharp scourges body and bone
Sith spread on a cross and crowned with thorn
Through his hands and fete heart nails did gone
A bright spear to his heart sharply was borne
He shed his blood for our love and life leued him none
After and ayzell they gave him for scorn
with gyle
It was great pity for to se
When he was nailed on a tree
The second lefe sycurly
Dyed for us all
The fourth lefe of the look alone she stood
Wryngynge her hands and weeping for woo
With a mourning chere and mylde mode
Her sons color faded and wexed wonder blo
Down by his white sides ran the red blood
Hard roches did ryue and temples in two
Then swowned the fourth lefe and to the ground yode
Alas for the trueloue that it should twyne so
full yare
She saw her dear son dye
Saint Johan stood her by
(...) comfort the lady
That was cast in care
Yet spoke ye noble king that was nailed on the tree
To his mother so mylde that was mournyng that tide
And said leave thy weeping woman mourn not for me
Take Johan too thy sone that wonneth the beside
Johan take mary to thy mother for to myrthe the
To keep and to comfort your bliss for to bide
The hot blood of his sides caused longes to se
That sought by a spear shafte fro his wou^des wide
that day
It was great pity for to se
When he was take of the tree
The second lefe of the three
Was closed in clay
When he was take of the rode and delued full yare
All the welthe of ye world with the iij. leaves lay
The fourth for woo fell and syghed full sare
With truth of the world was with the true may
Though his ma^hede was deed his might was the more
On his holy handy works his heart was aye
The soul with the god head to hell did fare
The body and the man head did bide the iij. day
full yare
All that he with his hands had wrought
And says with his blood bought
Till they were out of bale brought
Him longed full sare
Than said sorry sathanas his solowe was sad
For ye sight of the selcuth he was nothing feign
He said to us comes some bodworde I trow it be bad
What art thou with thy fair face thus did him frayne
King of Joy is my name thy gestes to glad
Let me in for their love thou should not layne
He said wend away with thy might thou make us all made
What should thou do in this pythere is nothing but pain
When they herd the king spoke
All their gates they did shyt fast
Sone the bars did break
And all the bands braste
For his holy handy works there harowed he hell
All the^ brought out of bale that ever had been his
Dauyd his derlynge made myrthe them among
With an herpe in his hand he harped I wysse
All his retenue out could he tell
And of his great mercy forgave them their mysse
He said I was sold for your sake and suffered wou^des wide
And all my good children be brought unto bliss
on the roode
The sothe is not to layne
When they were brought out of pain
To the blyssed body again
The holy ghost yode
The fourth lefe of the trueloue was folden for woe
She was left maid mother and wife
The first lefe full of might his will was so
By the assente of the third lefe was there no strife
They raised up the second between them two
Through might of the godhede from death unto life
He took a cross in his hand and forth he did go
With his flesh and his wounds fyfe
he yode
When he was risen again
He met mary magdalayne
It was no marvel if she was feign
He was her leche good
Forth went mari magdalayne with mirth and with mode
She told the tidings to T^omas of ynde
How christ was risen again that shed his heart blood
(...)this Thomas thou shalt it true find
Then spoke Thomas instead there he stood
Women be talking it comes to them by kind
He would never believe it till christ to him yode
And apered to the apostles so clerks has in mind
He put his hand to his side
He blessed all that time
That byleued on his wounds wide
And saw they never with eye
Forth went the semly the soth for to say
To seek his dyssyples that ever were true
Says to our lady that he had loved ay
All hole in his hurtes of hyde and of hew
She was ever stable and still and failed never faye
The iiij. leaves of troueloue they spring ever new
Our lord assended into heaven on holy thursdaye
Then followed his mother with myrthes ynowe
full even
Before her sone she kneled down
With a good devotion
On her head he set a crown
And made her queen of heaven
The iiij. lefe of the trueloue blessed must she be
She may have Joy in her heart of her gentle child
On his faders right hand her sone may she se
And the holy ghost that to them can bylde
Now be they hole in one godhede and persons three
And she is maid of might and mother full mylde
Such a another trueloue growed never on tree
Who so trysteth on that trueloue shall not be gyled
so hende
Wellis that wight
That may besure of the sight
Where ever is day and ever light
And Joy without end
Thus has the fair trueloue made us all fre
Our souls out of bondage and bought us on the rode
He commanded us to keep and gave pauste
Our souls out of sin for any worlds good
Much sorrow would we have and we our souls myt se
When they be sonken in sin as rysshe in a flode
Then abide we in bondage in bale for to be
He that us boughte with his holy heart blood
to have bliss
He bad axe mercy when we may
And bid our lady for us pray
Or we be closed in claye
Or else of our myrthe shall we mysse
Blessed be the trueloue so meke and so mylde
Sure and steadfast and stable in faye
When we have wrathed iij. with our works wild
The fourth lefe is gracyous and good us to help aye
Then kneleth she down before her dear child
Sore weeping for our sake with her eyes graye
She is ever full of grace alas we were begyled
She wynneth with her weeping many fair pray
for to keep
Sith she is welthe of our well
And all our care would kele
Alas why make ye her to knele
And for our works weep
There is none in this world so doughty nor so dear
King nor queen though he were a crown
Nor no fair ladies of colors so clear
When dreadful death comes it draws all down
Yet list us never leave it for priest nor for friar
Till we feel we fall with swelte and with swowne
When the bare body is brought on bear
Than fails all felawshyp in field and in town
In a clothe be we knyt
Sith put in a pyt
and earth upon us done
Of all the world be we quyt
Forgoten be we soon
For the caytyf corse there is but little care
and we were sure of our souls where they should dwell
But now is now in this world so wise his of lare
Nor no clerk in coming that thereof can tell
How far and how feel our souls must fare
Hardwayes is to heaven and hasty to hell
In purgatory is great pain who so comes there
Of much woe shall they wit that therein shall dwell
so long
What so ever we do here we fare
Before us shall we find there
We may be sure of no more
When pains be full strong
When great fyers grym be made in our gate
Then is there no glosynge but it must we glyde
When we be put in the pain so hard and so hot
We seek after socoure on every side
We cry after kynne folk they come to us to late
Then he have felt the fire faysed is our pride
Then of all our sorrow no sertayne we wate
But trust on the trueloue his mercy to abide
with dread
Now is time to begin
The trueloue to win
That all our bales he may blyn
When he have most need
Of all ye days yt we have lived ones shall we know
When we remember our foul sins sore may we moan
When the great lord above his bemes shall blow
And hye Iustyse shall sit in his trone
And all the folk in the world shall rise on a row
The quycke may quake when the deed shall up rise
We may let for no shame our sins to show
There is no gold nor fee yt may make our maynpryse
and kynne
For then is all our pride gone
Our robes and our rich pane
Save a crysome alone
That we were crystened in
When we be called to ye court us be houeth to here
All shall be there seen bond men and free
The soul and the body that long has sen sere
Be houeth to be present at the semble
Every soul shall be send to seek after his fere
When christ well us gather a greece lord is he
With our flesh and our fell as we in world were
Never more to sonder after that day be
for to know
Our works be written and scorde
In a roll of record
Before the great lord
Full sharply to show
We must seek thither in a simple tyer
Trembling and quakynge as lefe on a tree
When all the world is set with water and fire
There is no wre^che nor no will will wysshe us to fle
When christ is grieved he is a grym syer
So many sinful wretches as he there shall see
Then dare not his mother if she would desire
Not speak to her son so dreadful is he
that day
All to saints in heaven
They shall be still of their steven
They dare not a word meuen
For no man to pray
The werckes of mercy he will reken them seven
When I was thrusty how hardly have ye me fed
When I was thrusty how hardly have ye me given
When I was naked how have ye me cledde
When I was housles harbowred ye me even
Or vysyte me in syknes or sought to my bed
Or comforted me in prison that word I here meuen
Or brought me to buryeng when death has me sted
they say
Or lord when saw we the
Ever in any such degree
He said the leest in the name of me
That thou might pray
He will show us his wounds blody and bare
All he suffered for our sake bitter and wide
Kings and queen's before him must fare
Bysshoppes and barons all must abide
Earls and Emperoures none will he spare
Prestes nor prelates or persons of pride
Iustyse and Iuges of law and of lere
That now be full ryall to rynne and to ride
in land
Their dome shall they take there
Right as they have demed here
When they were of might more
And domes had in hand
Rich ladies that has robes full yare
Riches and rubyes with gowns full wide
Bendes and myrroures and fyllettes full fair
Gold on their garlondes with perre and pride
Kalle and kercheffes that coucheth on their heir
So sharply and shynynge to show by their side
All that welthe is away and mirth much more
But if we win the truloue vnglad may we glyde
for sorrow
Betyme is best to begin
Or were sonken in sin
For then is another kyth nor kynne
Fro bale may us borowe
By lords and ladies all I will not say
But some thing by other folks yt I find full well
The galande gedlynge that kythis gentry
With daynty damoyselles no man may dele
They have purfels and perles and heddes full hye
Though her corse be the myddle of her kattell
If men talk of her kynne away will she wrye
Her fader and mother fair would she hill
and tide
When that day shall begin
No man shall shame with their kynne
All shall shame with their sin
And with their foul pride
The dome of the trueloue full sore may we dread
For then is all the time past of mercy to crave
When every man is demed after his own deed
The^ may not our self sterte and send forth our knave
For he rekeneth by reason so clerks can read
He sets on his right hand ye souls that he will save
The sinful wretches that may not speed
Shall stand on his left hand away for to have
for aye
Then will our lady weep sore
For sorrow that she shall se there
When she may help no more
Great mourning shall be that day
Now is time for to speak for them that will speed
And seek after socoure and folly to flee
And not on domes day when we have most need
Now is much mercy and then will none be
When our dear lady dare not for dread
Speak to her dear sone so dreadful is he
How may we axe mercy for our mysdede
That will not follow to it when it is fre
thore
There is no way but ij.
Wheder that we shall go
To well and to woo
To dwell for evermore
Thus the bright bird taught the true may
And she blessed his body his bone and his blood
To the fourth lefe I read that we pray
That she would our message do with a mylde mode
And speak for the love before the last day
To the third lefe gracyous and good
The love of the iiij. leaves that we win may
That grace grant great god that dyed on the rod.
walking
This I herd in a valaye
As I went on my way
In a mourning of may
When meadows can spring
