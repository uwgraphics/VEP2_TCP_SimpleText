To the right Honorable, Sr SEBASTIAN HARVY Knight, Lord Mayor of the
Honorable City of London, and to the right Worshipful Aldermen and Sheriffs
his Brethren, and to the right Worshipful Mr Recorder, together with the whole
estate of the said City, all true happiness.
Right Honorable, Right Worshipful;
YOur Honor and Worships being (by the good guiding providence of GOD) the
General, Captains, and Liefetenants of this Metropolis, this chief City and
Castle of the Kingdom, wherein (by the same Providence) I am (though one of the
meanest, yet) one of the Watchmen; To whom ought I rather to present these
fruits of my Watchmans function, then unto your Honor and Worships? As duty in
regard of your places, so gratefulness also in regard of your kindnesses,
requires as much. My Father, Grandfather, and other Predecessors, have of old
from time to time been beholding to this Honorable City: the kindness which
they formerly received, is still continued to me. Which as I do with all
humble thankfulness acknowledge, so from my heart I desire the Almighty to
remember your Honor and Worships, together with the whole estate of this
Honorable City, in goodness, and not to wipe out the kindness which is
showed to the Ministers of his Word, and to poor distressed people. Long has
the Gospel been purely, powerfully, plentifully preached in this honorable
City, and great countenance and maintenance has by many therein been given
thereunto. Good orders have within these later years been taken for the
better sanctifying of the Lords Sabbath. Much relief is from time to time
given to the poor. These and such like works of Piety and Charity, are the
beauty, honor, strength, and wealth of this City. I deny not, but that in the
outward politic government of this great Corporation, and the many several
Companies therein, London may be accounted the glory of the earth. But the
things which make it exceed in glory, are, the fair houses of Prayer and
preaching the Word; the great Assemblies of Gods people frequenting the same to
worship God: the spacious Hospitals and places of Charity, together with the
liberal provision therein made for relief of poor children and orphants, of
aged and impotent men and women, of lame and maimed soldiers, and of many
other like succourlesse persons; the thrones of Justice and Judgment, with the
like, wherein London may be compared to Sion the City of God, whereof great and
excellent things are spoken. Right Honorable and Right Worshipful, go on
this way, (which is the only right way) to procure the peace and prosperity of
your City. Let the Ministry of Gods Word be more and more promoted: Let the
Lords Sabbaths have their due observations, let the poor be relieved, and the
oppressed be succored; let profane persons and all evil doers (the enemies of
Christian Policies) be punished: In a word, let Gods Ordinances be advanced,
and right judgment executed, and so shall London be accounted the City of the
great King, where he will delight to dwell, and bestow his blessing. For in
these things is God highly honored: Now God who can and will perform it, 1 Samuel 2. 30.
has said it; Them that honor me, will I honor. It lies much in the power
of Magistrates to procure or hinder the blessing of God in those Cities and
places over which they are set. For they being public persons, their good
deeds are by the wise God publicly rewarded, and their evil deeds publicly
revenged. Right Honorable and Right Worshipful, accept, I pray you, the duty,
and pardon the boldness of your Watchman. And, O Lord of Lords, do good to this
City of thine, continue the peace and prosperity thereof: so prays

Your Honors and Worships in all duty for ever bounden WILLIAM GOVGE.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, RJGHT WORSHIPFVLL, AND OTHER my beloved Parishioners,
Inhabitants of the precinct of Blacke-fryers London, Grace in Christ.
Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, Beloved;
AMong the many great blessings which the Lord has been pleased to bestow on
me, his poor servant, unworthy of the least, I account this to be an high
Favor, that he has put me in his Service, and appointed me to be one of the
Ministers of his Word. Basely is this calling accounted of by the greater, and
vulgar sort of people: but my conscience bears me witness that I receive
such contentment therein, and hold my self so honored thereby, as I prefer
it to all other callings, and am provoked thereby to give some evidence of my
thankful acceptance thereof: which better I know not how to do, then by
employing and improuing to my poor power, the Talent which my Master has
committed to my charge. I am not ignorant how insufficient I am thereunto,
(...).
and that not only in regard of the greatness of the work ( whereunto who is
sufficient?) but also in comparison of other Ministers, 2 Cor. 2. 16.
whom God in great number has raised up in these our days. Yet withal I know
that the great Master accepted the employment of two talents as well as of
fine: Mat. 25. 23.
yea, if he that received but one talent, had employed it, even he also should
have been accepted: for God, the righteous Judge, 2 Timothy 4. 8.
neither exacteth, nor expects more then he gives. If there be a willing
mind, it is accepted according to that which a man has, 2 Cor. 8. 12.
and not according to that which he has not. This is it which moves me, as by
Preaching, so also by publishing some part of my labors in Print, to seek the
edification of Gods Church. I account Preaching the most principal part of my
function: for this is Christ's charge, Mar. 16. 15.
Go preach the Gospel; and this is that Ordinance wherein and whereby God
does ordinarily, and most especially manifest his own power, and bestow his
blessing. This is it therefore which hitherto I have most attended upon, and
intend so to continue as long as God shall afford me ability and liberty. Yet
I doubt not but Gods people do also receive much benefit by sundry Treatises
in diverse kinds published in print. For as Preaching is of power especially to
work upon the affections, so Printing may be one especial means to inform
the judgment. Vox audita perit, littera scripta manet.
For that which is Printed lies by a man, and may again and again be read,
and thoroughly pondered, till a man come to conceive the very depth of that he
reads. Besides, herein is a great benefit of printing, that the gifts and
pains of Gods servants are made much more common then otherwise they could be:
hereby we partake of the labors of those who have lived in former times, or
in other Countries, and whom we could never have heard speak. Now a good
thing, Bonum quo communius eo melius.
the more common it is, the better it is. It cannot be denied but that
knowledge and learning have wonderfully increased by the benefit of Printing.
Whereas there is a common complaint against multitude of Books, it is for the
most part against idle and evil Books, or else an unjust complaint. If it be
said, that there can nothing be written, but what has been written before, I
answer, that though it should be true in regard of the sum and substance of
matters, yet in regard of a more full opening, a more perspicuous delivering, a
more evident proving, a more powerful urging and pressing of points, Aliquid
novus ad^cit Author.
a more fit applying of them to present occasions more and more may be, and
daily is added by sundry Authors, whereby the Church of God is much edified.
But may not the same argument be alleged against Preaching? and do not many
allege it? Howsoever some, too enuiously minded, censure the means which God
in mercy has affoorded for the building up of the body of Christ Jesus, my
desire is every way to do what good I can; and therefore I have been bold to
commit to your eyes and reading, some part of that which I have heretofore
commended to your ears and hearing. I do now make a trial of my pains in
this kind: if I shall observe that Gods Church reapeath any benefit thereby, I
shall be encouraged to take the more pains hereafter, as I shall find any
leisure. I am the servant of Christ, and of his Church; so long as my life,
health, strength, liberty, or any ability is by the good providence of God
preserved unto me, my desire is to spend it in the service of Christ, and of
his Church. Among others I especially entreat you (my beloved Parishioners and
Auditors, of what rank or degree soever ye be) in the best part to interpret,
and with the best mind to accept these my endeauours; whereby, though I have
aimed at a more general good, then I could by preaching (hoping that many whom
I never knew, nor saw, may reap some benefit by my pains) yet especially I
intend your good, whose proper and peculiar Minister I am, and for whose souls
I watch, as he that must give an account. In this trial which I make of
publishing some of my meditations, I begin with the last part of my labors,
because they are freshest in your memories that heard them preached, and
contain points more largely discussed, and, as I take it, of greater use then
any other, which throughout the course of my Ministry I have handled. For the
time of our life being a time of war, a time wherein our spiritual enemies
(who are many, mighty, malicious, sedulous, and subtle) put forth their
strength, and bestir themselves to the uttermost that possibly they can, 1 Pet.
5. 8.
Seeking whom to devour, what can be more behoueful, then to discover their
cunning stratagems and wyles, to declare wherein their strength lies, to
furnish Christ's Soldiers with complete armor and sufficient defense, and to
show how our enemies may be disappointed of their hopes, and we stand fast
against all their assaults? This is the scope of this Treatise. The Analysis
and Tables which I have caused to be set before and after the Book, do point
out the several and distinct points contained therein, so as I need not here
make any repetition of them. I have labored to be as perspicuous and brief
as I could, in handling so weighty matters. I have in many places delivered no
more then the heads of such points as I largely handled in delivering them out
of the Pulpit: which any may well conjecture to be so, that shall know that the
substance of almost an hundred several Sermons is contained in this Treatise.
My desire of breuity moved me to refer the quotation of most places of
Scripture unto the margent, and to leave the Text to be searched out by the
Reader, which I wish thee to do as thy leisure will permit thee. To conclude,
I commend this Treatise to your diligent reading, and favorable acceptance, my
self to your Christian prayers, and all of us to the good grace of God,
Church-court in Blackfriars London, December 31. 1618.
and rest

Your servant in the Lords work, WILLIAM GOVGE.

AN ADVERTISEMENT to the Reader.
CHRISTIAN READER,
THE good entertainment which this Treatise of The whole Armor of God, has
found among Gods people, emboldeneth me again to publish the same. The same it
is for substance which thou had before: for I find no just cause to alter
any part of the substance thereof. Only here and there something has been
added, to make such points as seemed too concise and obscure, more perspicuous.

Some there were, that finding the head of Fasting in the Table, looked for a
distinct and larger discourse of that point, which when they found not (for I
did but briefly by the way touch it, as an help to Prayer) they entreated me
to take a little more pains thereabout. To their good motion I have yielded,
and according to my poor ability, and little leisure, I have more copiously
handled that very-needfull, but too-much-neglected duty of Fasting.

I was further informed that the point of not praying for them that sin
against the Holy Ghost, would much trouble the consciences of some, if they
were not informed in the nature of that sin; and thereupon I have been moved
to annex a Treatise concerning that sin: in handling whereof, lest Sa^tan
should take advantage upon weak consciences, from the fearful issue thereof,
to exclude themselves or others (who have not fallen into that sin) from all
hope of pardon. I have (treading in the steps, and following the path wherein
Jesus Christ has gone before me) with the severity of Gods Justice in
affording no pardon to that sin, mixed the riches of his Mercy, in offering
pardon to all other sins: so as this Treatise affords more matter of hope
and comfort, then of fear and despair.

In this Edition there are for thy help more distinctions of several points
then were before. For that which before was set forth as one Treatise, is now
divided into three several Treatises, and the Treatise of the Sin against
the Holy Ghost, added thereto, makes a fourth.

These several Treatises are also divided into their distinct Parts: and
again subdivided into sundry Sections: over every of which the sum and head
of the matter therein handled, is set. Thus both great light is given for
better understanding, and also a ready way is made for finding out the several
points contained in this Book.

A Table of all these Divisions, and of the distinct heads of every of them is
set before the Book, that if it please thee, thou may at once take a brief
view of all.

That which I especially have aimed at for thee, is thy spiritual edification.
That which I earnestly desire of thee, is the help of thy faithful prayers.

Pray for me

The servant of Christ, and of his Church, W. G.

daunted with their enemies.

The Motive is taken from the danger, in which we are by reason of our
spiritual enemies, whom he describes verse. 12. Every word almost in this
Direction is of weight, and worthy to be searched into.

. 2. The necessity of the point.
THe first point in order is the Manner of the Apostles exhortation,

Which sets forth, 1. The necessity of the thing urged, Finally. 2. The
affection of him that urges it, my Brethren.


The original world translated finally, (...)
signifies, a remainder, Obser. 1.
and implies that yet remained one necessity point to be delivered before he
made an end, The necessary of this Direction.
as if with more copy of words he had thus said; Though I have sufficiently
instructed you in doctrines of faith, and precepts of manners, yet there is one
needful point behind, which being delivered, I may conclude all: there is yet
(I say) a remainder, and the only remainder of all, by which ye may make good
use of all that has been hitherto delivered, without which, all will be in
vain.

Direction so needful a point? a point which may not be omitted? a point worthy
of the last place, as most of all to be remembered? then Hebr. 21.
ought we to give the more earnest heed thereunto, lest at any time we should
let it slip. In hearing we must well heed it: after we have heard it, we must
well keep it, and (...)
not let it slip like water put into a colinder or riuen dish.

. 3. The Apostles affection.
TO urge this point yet somewhat the more forcibly, the Apostle in the next
place manifests his affection in these words, My brethren, which declare both
the humility of his mind, and the gentleness of his spirit.

Brother is a word of equality: Obser. 2.
in calling them Brethren, he makes himself equal unto them, The Apostles
humility.
though he himself were one of the principal members of Christ's body, one of
the eyes thereof, a Minister of the Word, an extraordinary Minister, an
Apostle, a spiritual Father of many souls, a planter of many famous Churches,
yea the planter of this Church at Ephesus: and though many of them to whom he
wrote, were poor mean men, handicrafts men, such as Chap 4. v. 28
labored with their hands for their living: and many also Verse. 5. 8.
servants, and bondmen; yet without exception of any, he terms and counts
them all his brethren, and so Romans 12. 16.
makes himself euall to them of the lower sort. Behold his humility: For if
to affect titles of superiority, as Rabbi, Doctor, Father, be a note of
arrogancy (as it is, Mat. 23. 7, etc.
and therefore Christ in that respect taxes the Scribes and Pharisees) then to
take and give titles of equallitie, is a note of humility. The like notes of
humility may be often noted both in other Epistles of this Apostle, and in the
Epistles of other Apostles; yea and in all the Prophets also.

Well they knew, Reason.
that notwithstanding there were diverse offices, places, and outward degrees,
among Christians: yet they Mal. 2. 10. Ephesians. 4. 6.
all had one Father, and were fellow members of 1 Cor. 12. 12.
One and the same body, and in regard of their spiritual estate Gal. 3. 28.
all one in Christ Jesus.

Account all Brethren.
For Christ, though he were Lord of all, yet for as much as Heb. 2. 11, 14.
he took part with us, and so all were of one, he was not ashamed to call us
Brethren. Who then can disdain to call any Saint Brother? This point of
humility and meekness Christ wills us after an especial manner to Matthew.
11. 29*
learn of him. It is a grace which will highly grace us before God and man. It
makes us amiable in Gods eyes, who Prou. 3. 34.
Gives grace to the lowly: and it makes our company very acceptable to men.
An humble minded man who makes himself equal to them of the lower sort, and
accounts all his brethren, will be sociable and willing to converse with any
for their mutual good. But proud and ambitious spirits are full of scorn and
disdain, so as men cannot well endure their company, and 1 Pet. 5. 5.
God will resist them. Wherefore, to conclude this point, whatsoever your parts
of nature, or gifts of Gods Spirit be, whatsoever your place or calling be,
whatsoever excellency or eminency you have above others, remember that all
Saints have one Father, all are of one body, all are one in Christ, therefore
all account one another Brethren. Let Magi strates, Ministers, and all of all
sorts apply this.

Brethren one to another, This title brother, not to be ^corned.
do they not through those Saints sides strike the Prophets, the Apostles, yea
and Christ himself?

Note further the gentle and mild spirit of the Apostle; Brethren, Obser. 3.
The Apostles mildness.
is a title of kindness and love: My, an attribute which adds emphasis
thereunto. In other places he uses other attributes, which add greater
emphasis, as 1 Cor. 15. 58.
My beloved brethren, Phil. 4. 1.
My brethren beloved and longed for. So like wise other phrases which imply as
great meekness and gentleness, as Gal. 4. 19.
My little children, 1 Cor. 4. 1^.
My beloved children, etc.

It was not want of authority to command that made him thus gently exhort, but
rather an earnest desire that he had to persuade, and even provoke them to do
that which was their bounden duty and tended to their good. Mark how he
deals with Philemon, verse 9, 10, 20, by this meekness he insinuates
himself into them, and shows that he seeks not himself, and his own
good, so much as them and their good.

Enforce exhor tations with evidence of love.
even with evidences of love, with all mildness and gentleness. ( 2 Timothy 2. 24.
The servants of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle toward all men.) Thus
shall you give them a pleasant savor and sweet relish, yea though the things
whereunto ye exhort be unpleasing to men's natural taste, and carnal
appetite. Simil.
When full some potions or bitter pills are sweetened with sugar, they will the
sooner be swallowed, and better digested: so exhottations seasoned with terms
of mildness and gentleness.

Thus much for the manner of the Apostles direction.

. 4. The need of Christian courage.
THe matter follows, the first part whereof is in these words, Be strong in
the Lord, and in the power of his might: wherenote, first, what is required,
secondly, how that which is required may be performed.

The thing required is to be strong, the Apostle here speaks of an inward
spiritual strength, the strength of the inward and new man, and his meaning is
that we should be valorous and courageous in the performance of those
Christian duties which we take in hand.

Christian valor and spiritual courage is a needful grace. Doct. 1.
Note with what variety of phrase the Apostle does exhort hereunto, Spiritual
valor needful.
1. Cor. 16. 13. Stand fast, quit you like men, be strong: hereunto Ios. 1. 6.
7.
God persuades his servant Ioshuah, and 1 Chr. 18. 10.
David, his son Solomon. 1 Samuel 17. 45
David had in him this holy valor and courage, when he went against Goliath,
and Acts 21. 13.
Paul when he was going to Jerusalem. But most valorous and strong did Christ
our Captain show himself, when he was going up to Jerusalem to suffer, Luke 9.
51.
The Evangelist says, he steadfastly set his face, he settled himself fully to
go: though it were to drink a most bitter cup, he would not be drawn from it.
Because Peter labored to dissuade him, Mat. 16. 23.
he sharply rebuked him, and called him Satan.

The reasons why this spiritual valor is so needful, are specially two.

First, Reason 1.
because of our own indisposition, timerousnes, dullness, and back wardnesse
to all holy and good duties. What Christian finds not this by woeful
experience in himself? when he would pray, hear Gods word, partake of the
Sacraments, sanctify the Sabbath, or perform any other like Christian duty,
there is I know not what fearfulness in him, his flesh hangs back, as a
Bear when he is drawn to the stake. Romans 7. 18. (...) etc.
This the holy Apostle found in himself: so that for the rowsing up of our own
dullness we have need of valor.

Secondly, Reason 2.
because of those many oppositions which we are like to meet withal. We heard
before how the flesh would hang back, and so labor to hinder us. The world will
like wise do what it can, either by vain inticements to seduce us (as it drew
away Demas,) or else by reproach, trouble, and persecution, to terrify us, (as
those who forsook Paul) But above all the Devil will be ready to resist us,
(as Zach. 3. 1.
he resisted Iehoshuah) and to hinder us ( 1 These. 2. 18.
as he hindered Paul) yea to buffet us (as 2. Cor. 12. 7.
he buffeted the same Paul.) To omit other instances, most lively is this set
forth in our Head and General Christ Jesus. So soon as he was set apart to
his public Ministry, Matthew. 4. 1.
the Tempter came to him: after he began to execute it, Satan stirred up the
Rulers, Priests, Scribes, Pharisees, and many other to hinder him; yea he moved
Mat. 16. 22.
Peter to dissuade him, and when Christ was about to offer up himself a
sacrifice, then again John 14. 30.
came the Prince of this world to discourage him. The like oppositions are all
Christ's members to look for; so as there is no hope, no possibility of
holding out and enduring to the end without this Christian valor and
magnanimity here spoken of.

Timerousnes taxed.
and undertake such Christian duties as are required at their hands. Hence it
comes to pass that many duties are clean omitted of them, other intermitted
and broken off before they are half done: and as for those which are done, so
untowardly are they done, that little or no comfort can be found in doing of
them. Lamentable experience shows how small matters do discourage many who
know the right way, and are often in conscience moved to walk therein.

Such as want this Christian courage, were better not give up their names to
be Christ's Soldiers, or profess that they intend to fight the Lords
battles: for by their timerousnesse and cowardlinesse they discourage other
Soldiers of the Lord, and hearten the enemy. The Lord would not suffer any
that were Deuteronomy 21. 8. Judges 7. 3.
fearful and faint hearted to fight his battles on earth against earthly
enemies, lest they made others faint like themselves. Can we think that he
will entertain faint hearted soldiers in his spiritual battles against
spiritual enemies, in which combats his own honor, and his childrens
salvation are so deeply engaged?

As for the Enemy he is like a Wolf, if strongly he be resisted, James 4. 7.
he will fly; if timerously he be yielded unto, he will more eagerly pursue
and insult.

Endeavor we therefore to get unto our selves an holy courage and spiritual
valor, shaking off our natural fearfulness, Phil. 1. 28.
that in nothing we fear our adversaries, but (as Christ our General did) Heb.
12. 2.
endure the cross, and despise the shame.) We that will be Christ's soldiers
must duly consider the advice which our Lord gives, Luke 14 13. which is, to
observe what kind of enemies, how many, how mighty, we are to encounter
withal. We shall On verse 12.
hereafter hear how hard a battle we are to undertake, how many, mighty,
malicious, subtle our enemies be: if notwithstanding all this we be minded to
fight under Christ's banner, then be we strong and courageous, bold as Prou. 30.
30.
Lions; so are the Prou. 28. 1.
righteous.

. 5. All strength from God.
But alas, Object.
what are we weak flesh and blood? What strength can there be in us to fight
against such enemies as will set on us?

For removing this scruple, Answer.
the Apostle adds this clause, in the Lord, etc. whereby he shows how we
come to be strong, not by any strength in our selves, but by seeking strength
in the Lord, casting our selves wholly and only on him, and on his power.

The strength and valor whereby we are enabled to fight the Lords battle,
Doct. 2. Our strength is in the Lord.
is hid in the Lord, and to be had from him. For 2 Cor. 3. 5.
all our sufficiency is of God, John. 15. 5.
without Christ we can do nothing. Hence is it that David says unto God,
Psalm. 18. 1, 2.
I love thee dearly, O Lord my strength: The Lord is my rock and fortress,
etc.

It is more evident then needs be proved, that this our Apostle was a strong
and valiant champion of the Lord; but whence had he this strength? Phil. 4. 13.
I am able (says he) to do all things through the help of Christ which
strengthens me. That which in particular he says of himself, he also
affirms of other Saints, who Col. 1. 11.
were strengthened with all might through Gods glorious power.

The Lord has thus reserved all strength in himself, Reasons.
and would have us strong in him: partly for his own glory, and partly for
our comfort.

glory, that in time of need we might fly unto him, 2. Cor. 12. 9.
and in all streights cast our selves on him: and being preserved and
delivered, acknowledge him our Savior, and accordingly give him the whole
praise.

comfort, that in all distresses we might be the more confident. Much more
bold may we be in the Lord, then in our selves. Gods power being infinite, it
is impossible that it should be mated by any adverse power, which at the
greatest is finite: were our strength in our selves, though for a time it might
seem somewhat sufficient, yet would there be fear of decay: but being in God,
we rest upon an omnipotency, and so have a far surer proppe unto our faith,
as we shall hear in the next Doctrine.

Renounce all confidence in the self.
Thus shall we be brought to seek for help out of our selves. They who over
ween themselves, and conceit that they are sufficiently able to help
themselves, will be so far from seeking strength, that they will foully
scorn it, when it is offered unto them Mark what is said of the wicked man,
who is proud in his own conceit, Psalm. 10. 3.
He contemns the Lord: as Prou. 27. 7.
he that is full despises an honey comb, so he that is confident in his own
strength, despises help from any other.

Rest on a sure ground.
our care must be to fly to a sure ground, and rest thereon: so shall we be
safe and sure, yea so may we be quiet and secure. This sure ground, and safe
rock is only the Lord: strong he is in himself, and can both strengthen us,
and weaken our enemies. In this confidence did 1 Samuel 17. 45
David come against Goliath, and prevailed Thus may we be sure of victory:
Romans 8. 37.
Through God we are more then conquerours.

It is vain to trust in ones self.
whose pride at length shall have a fall. Such in regard of outward power were
1 Samuel 17. 8.
Goliath, and Isa. 36. and 37
Senache^ib. Intolerable is this presumption, even in outward strength: note
their end, 1. Sam. 17. 50. and Isa. 37. 36, 37, 38. But more then most
intolerable in spiritual strength, whereof we have not one dram in our
selves, but in that respect are as 2 Samuel 14. 14
water spilt upon the ground. Mat. 26. 35.
Peter was too confident therein: had he not seen his presumption after he
began to be puffed up, and speedily humbled himself, fearful had been the
issue thereof: for nothing more provoke God then spiritual James 4. 6. Or in
any other creature.
pride, because nothing is more derogatory to his glory.

Vain also is their confidence who go from weak to weak, from themselves to
other creatures; like the Isa. 30. 2, 3.
Israelites, who went to the Egyptians for help. Fitly does the Ezec. 29. 6. 7
Gregory 7. surnamed Heldebrand (a very brand of h^^) a Necromancer and a
bloody tyrant.
Prophet compare them to a reed, whereupon if one lean, Boniface 7. and 8.

it breaks and renteth his arm. Such are the si^ly Papists, among whom some
think to be strong in Pope Gregory, Alexander 6. compa^^ed with the diuel^
to be Pope, an incestuous, vn^aciable adulterer.
Pope Boniface, Pope Alexander, and such others, whom without breach of
charity we may think to be very feenes in hell: other in Saint George,
Saint Christopher, and such other who never were: the Histories of them are
mere fictions: other (who think they have a far surer ground of confidence)
in Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and such like holy and worthy Saints: but the
best Saints that ever were, had no strength to help others; they only had a
sufficiency for themselves. Thus it comes to pass, that in their greatest
need, when they seek and look for best help, they are all like those Ier. 14.
3.
who came to the wels and found no water: they returned with their vessels
empty: they were ashamed, and confounded, and covered their heads.

. 6. Gods power most mighty.
THat we may be the rather moved to renounce all vain confidence in our
selves or other creatures, and be bold, valiant, and strong in the Lord,
casting our whole confidence in him alone, the Apostle adds these next words
( in the power of his might) which are a very forceable amplificatio^ of this
former point. Some distinguish these two words, power and might, as the cause
and effect, attributing might to God, and power to the Saints, and so make Gods
might the cause of their power, as if he had said, be strong in that power
which ye receive from the might of God. But I take this distinction here to
be, First too curious, and without good ground. Secondly, impertinent, because
that which the Apostle aims at, is to raise up our faith to God, and to
settle it firm in him, and therefore he sets forth the power of God, as it
is in God himself. Thirdly, not agreeable to the phrase, which is the same in
this clause as in the former, in the Lord, and in the power, etc. which
implies that the power here spoken of, is a power in the Lord, and that as
the Lord himself is without us, and above us, so is this power. The phrase
therefore which the Apostle here uses, I take to be an Hebraisme, which some
for perspicuitie sake translate thus, in his mighty power, and not unfitly.
This very phrase is used Chap. 1. verse. 19.
before, and by most translated his mighty power: this Hebraisme power of
might, adds great emphasis, and implies, that might by an excellency and
propriety belongs to Gods power only; and that all other power in comparison
of it, is mere weakness.

The point hence to be noted is this, that

The power of God whereunto we are to trust, Doct. 3. Gods power is a most
mighty power.
is a most mighty and strong power, a power able to protect us against the
might of al adverse power whatsoever. In this respect the Apostle calls Gods
power, ^Chap. 1. ^. 19.
an exceeding greatness of power. He searches after rare and high phrases to
set forth this power of God, (...).
because of the infinite greatness thereof, which cannot by ordinary and
usual phrases be expressed.

According to Gods greatness is his power, Reason.
infinite, incomprehensible, inutterable, inconceivable: as a mighty wind
which drives all before it: as a swift and strong stream against which none
can swim: as a burning flaming fire which consumes and deuoureth all; so is
Gods power. Whatsoever stands before it, and is opposed against it, is but as
chafe before a strong wind, or bulrushes before a swift current, or stubble
before a flaming fire; for all adverse power, though to our weakness it seem
never so mighty, yet can it be but finite, being the power of creatures, and
so a limited power, yea, a dependant power, subordinate to this power of might,
of his might, who is Almighty, and so no proportion betwixt them.

Gods mighty power a prop to faith.
and a good motive to make us 1 Pet. 1. 13.
perfectly trust unto the power of God without wavering or doubting,
notwithstanding our own weakness, or our adversaries power: though 2 Chr. 20.
12.
there be no strength in us, yet is there power in God: though we be on
every side environed with strong and fierce enemies, our flesh and the violent
lusts thereof, as headstrong rebels and traitors within us; the furious world,
with the potent and raging persecutors thereof, on one side; that fierce Lion
and cruel Dragon the Devil, with all his hellish host, on the otherside; yea
all these banding their forces together continually in arms against us, yet is
there in God a power of might, in comparison whereof all the power of all our
adversaries is but weakness. When we know not what to do, then may we, then
must we with faithful Iehosaphat turn our eyes to God, 2 Chronicles. 20. 12.
and to the power of his might. When we see potent enemies against us, and no
outward means to defend us against them, we are ready to cry, 2. King 6. 15.
Alas how shall we do? and with the Psalm. 78. 19, 20.
Israelites to doubt of the power of God, and say, Can God help in such
straits? can he support such weaklings as we are? can he subdue such and such
enemies as assault us? Against such doubts we are to meditate of this mighty
power of God. Gods power being a power of might, he needs nothing to help
him. The weaker we are, the more is his power manifested: for it is 2 Cor. 12.
9.
made perfect in weakness: neither can Gods power be weakened or hindered by
any adverse power. 1 Samuel 14. 6.
Many and mighty enemies are to him a few and weak ones: 2 Chr. 34. 11.
so that the more mighty his enemies be, Judges 7. 2, etc.
the more honor redoundeth to him in subduing them. Wherefore for strengthening
our faith, that we may be strong in the Lord, pray we that 2 King 6. 17.
God would open our eyes, that we may Chap. 1. v. 19.
see what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe: so
shall we neither fear because of our enemies power, nor faint because of our
own weakness, but Exodus 14. 13.
stand still and behold the salvation of God.

strong in this mighty power. It is no presumption to be confident in Gods
mighty power.
Indeed, if the ground of our assurance rested in, and on our selves, it might
justly be counted presumption; but the Lord, and the power of his might being
the ground thereof, they either know not what is the might of his power, or
else too too lightly esteem it, who account assured confidence thereon,
presumption. No doubt but many so deemed of David's confidence, when he
undertook the combat with Goliath: yea it is manifest that 1 Samuel 17. 28. 33.
his eldest brother Eliah, and also Saul so judged: but David's eye was lifted
up to God, he was strong in the power of Gods might, 1 Samuel 17. 37.
which made him so bold and confident. Thus we with like confidence and
assurance may trust unto the same mighty power, though all the world count us
presumptuous for it. The truth is that our adversaries might well object this
against us, if our confidence were in our own power, or rather weakness: but
being in the power of Gods might, unjustly they slander us, and most
injuriously impeach Gods mighty power.

. 7. The benefit of confidence in God.
TO conclude this first general point of Christian courage and confidence in
the Lord, The benefit of trusting to Gods power.
and in the power of his might, great is the benefit thereof, and that in three
respects especially;

1. It will remove causeless fear, Neh. 6. 11.
as in Nehemiah. Prou. 22. 13.
Solomon says, that a slothful timorous man is loath to step out of doors,
fearing that there is a Lion without, when he has no cause so to fear: and
that Prou. 28. 1.
The wicked fly when none pursue. But he that is strong in the Lord, and in
the power of his might, will make the uttermost trial.

2. It will make bold in apparent danger. Instance the example of Psalm. 3. 6.
David. In this respect Prou. 28. 1.
are the righteous resembled to a Lion.

3. It will recover a man's spirit, though he should by any occasion be
wounded, stricken down and foiled, so as at first he prevail not, yet it
will make him rise up again and renew the battle, like to the Ios. ^. 3. etc.
Israelites:

Thus at length shall we come to be Conquerours. Judge 20. 30.


THE SECOND PART.
The means of standing sure.
Ephesians. 6. 11. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand
against all the wiles of the Devil.
. 1. The heads of those means.
THE second part of the Apostles Direction now follows, which declares how
we may be well prepared against all danger.

Wherein first we are to consider the means whereby we may be prepared.

In the setting down whereof, the Apostle declares 1. What the means be. 2.
How to be used.


The means are expressed under this metaphor, Armor.

And further described, 1. By the kind thereof, Armor of God. 2. By the
sufficiency of it, whole armor.


. 2. Christians are Soldiers.
FOr the metaphor, it is taken from Soldiers, who in time of war, when they
enter the field against their enemies, are subject to much danger and many
annoyances of swords, spears, darts, arrows, bullets, and such like weapons
of their enemies, and therefore for their better safeguard use to be well
provided and fenced with good armor. In that the Apostle exhorts Christians
to put on armor, he gives us to understand, that,

A Christians course of life is a warfare: Doct. 1. Our life a warfare.
for armor, especially the use of armor, is a token of war: armor is not
given to a man to sit with it at a fire, or to lie lazing on a bed, or wantonly
to dance up and down, or follow pastimes and pleasures in it, but to fight: to
this purpose many like metaphors are used. Christians themselves are called 2 Timothy 2. 3.
Soldiers; their course of life 1 Timothy 1. 18.
a fight; they which oppose against them Luke 1. 71.
enemies; the temptations wherewith they are annoyed 1 Pet. 2. 11.
assaults; in a word, this is a difference betwixt the Church in Heaven and in
earth, that this is militant, that triumphant.

Thus has God in wisdom disposed our estate on earth for weighty reasons.
Reasons.


1. The more to manifest his pity, power, providence and truth in keeping
promise: the straits whereunto in this world we are brought, the promises which
God has made to deliver us, and the many deliverances which we have, show that
God pittieth us in our distresses, that he is provident and careful for our
good, and wise in disposing evil to good, that he is able to deliver us, and
faithful in doing it. For this cause did Exodus 14. 17. 18.
God suffer the Israelites to go into Egypt, to be there kept in hard bondage,
to be brought into many dangers, and set upon by many enemies.

2. To make proof of the gifts he bestows on his children. A soldiers
valor is not known but in war: in time of peace what difference is seen
betwixt a valourous man, and timorous coward? by that sore combat whereunto Job
1. 12.
Job was brought, were the graces which God had bestowed on him evidently made
known.

3. To weine them the better from this world: for so long as all things are
quiet in the world, without troubles, oppositions, and assaults, we are
exceedingly prone to delight in it, and to say, Mat. 17. 4.
It is good to be here. Much prosperity makes many to be like that Luke 12.
19.
fool that bid his soul live at ease, etc.

4. To make Heaven the more longed for while we are on earth, and the more
acceptable when we come to possess it. How earnestly does the soldier in
tedious and dangerous combats desire victory? How welcome is triumph after
war? As a safe haven to Mariners tossed up and down in troublesome seas, is
most welcome; so Heaven to Christians, whose life in this world is a warfare, a
sea-fare.

Be like soldiers.
2 Timothy 2. 3: (...). Endure hardness.
accordingly let us carry our selves; a little sleep, a little food is enough
for a soldier, he lies not on beds of down, he pampereth not his body with
delicate cheer: but he watches much, he fares hard, and lies hard. Thus
Christians may not suffer themselves to be overtaken with the vain delights
and pleasures of this world. Note what the Apostle says of a Christian
soldier, 2 Timothy 2. 4.
No man that warreth intangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that
he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier. Who having this armor
think to take their ease, follow their pleasures, embrace the world, they
pervert the maine end of it: for it is given to stand, and to resist; which if
they do not, unworthy they are of armor, and shall be cashired. Ease and rest
is not here to be looked for, but rather temptations and assaults which we
must watch against, and when one conflict is past, look for another, and
resist all as they come: of all things we must take heed of security, and
provide that at any time we be not unfurnished: read the Judges 18. 10. 27.
history of the people of Laish, and make a spiritual application thereof.

Thus much for the Metaphor.

. 3. The use of spiritual graces.
COnsider we now what is meant thereby. It is evident by the Verse 14, 15, 16,
17.
Apostles exemplification hereof, that such spiritual sanctifying graces, as
God indueth his Saints withal, are the armor here meant. In that these are
compared to armor, observe that

The graces of Gods Spirit are for safeguard and defense. Doct. 2. Spiritual
graces for defense.
This is the maine and principal end of armor, as the Apostle himself in
this, and in the 13. verse, plainly shows: for in both places expressly he
says, that we must put on and take to us the whole armor of God for this
very end, to stand against, and to resist our enemies. Thus is righteousness
as a breast plate, hope as an helmet, faith as a shield, al for defense, as we
shall after more distinctly show: in the mean while let this general
observation be noted, both of such as yet have none of those graces, and also
of such as have them, or at least think they have them.

Who want them seek them.
being so needful and necessary? what rest can they give unto their souls,
till they have obtained them? would we not count him a mad man, or at least
weary of his life, who should rush naked without any armor into the field among
his deadly enemies? what then may we judge of those that live in this world,
among the mortal enemies of their souls, utterly destitute of all saving
graces? how many thousands thus live, as it were, weary of their souls, and
Acts 13. 46.
judge themselves unworthy of eternal life?

For the other sort which have these grace, they are to use them for their
defense, as armor is used, and not for ostentation. Who have them, use them
for defense.
Armor is not given to iet up and down in it, and be proud of it, as many are
of apparel. Let those who have no better gifts then such as are called parts
of nature, as wit, strength, beauty, and the like, boast in them, if they list:
these are like light, slight, gay stuffes, which make children and fools
brag. Gods graces are of a more sound and solid substance, and therefore to
be used accordingly, and not made a matter of show and ostentation. Let this be
noted of such as are over conceited, and so proud of their knowledge, faith,
patience, and other graces.

. 4. Christians armor spiritual.
THus having handled the Metaphor, Why armor of God.
and the meaning thereof, come we to the amplification. The first point
whereof is the kind of armor here set forth. It is called armor of God, and
that in four especial: respects, 1. It is Jam. 8. 17.
made of God, even in heaven. 2. It is Psalm. 119. 98.
prescribed of God, even in his Word. 3. It is 1 Cor. 1 4.
given of God, even by his Spirit. 4. It is Heb. 13. 21.
agreeable to God, even to his will.


All these do show that,

The armor wherewith Christians are fenced, Doct. 3. The Christians armor is
spiritual.
is divine, and spiritual. In this respect, says the Apostle, 2. Cor. 10. 4.
The weapons of our warfare are not carnal: by denying one contrary, he
affirms the other: not carnal, that is, spiritual. The several pieces
after mentioned do evidently prove this point.

Our enemies are spiritual, Reason
and their assaults spiritual: must not then our armor needs be spiritual?
What other armor can stand us in stead against such enemies, such assaults? as
good have a sheet of paper on our naked breasts to keep off a musket shot, as
use any other armor then spiritual, against the spiritual assaults of
spiritual enemies.

Man's folly in fencing himself.
as

1. Of Coniurers, Sorcerers, and such like, who imagine that the Devil may be
driven away by charms, and they kept safe from him by spells, circles, etc.

2. Of superstitious Papists, Bellar. de cult. Sanct. li. 3. cap. 7. vtimur
aqua, olqo, etc. ad fugandos daemones.
who think to drive the Devil away with Holy Water, Holy-oyle, Crosses,
Crucifixes, Agnis Dei, etc.

3. Of sottish worldlings, who seek to arm themselves against the spiritual
assaults of Satan by outward means, as against grief of mind and terror of
conscience, by 1 Samuel 16. 16
music, company, gaming, etc. the truth is, that by these means great
advantage many times is given to the Devil: for thus he gets a surer
possession in them*

Not much unlike to these are they, who think by physic to purge away trouble
of conscience: as soon may an Ague be purged away by drinking cold water. All
these are very childish and ridiculous toys, mere scarcrowes, which the
Devil laugheth at.

an armor of God, let us be wise in distinguishing betwixt this and all
counterfeit armor: Learn to discern right armor.
for this end observe we diligently Gods word which describes it, and that so
plainly as we may easily discern it: we have no warrant to use any other:
neither can we safely trust to any other. Having therefore found which is the
armor of God, seek we it James 1. 17.
from above of the Father of lights, from whom it comes down, and Verse 5.
it shall be given. Having received it, give we the praise and glory thereof
to him that has given it, and use it according to his will, so may we
confidently trust unto it.

. 5. Christians armor complete.
THe next point is the sufficiency of this armor, termed whole armor. The
(...).
Greek word is a compound word, and signifies both all manner of armor that
is needful, and also such complete armor as covers all the body, and
leaves no part naked or unfenced. This is thus set down both to commend unto
us this armor, and also See Doct. 6.
to instruct us how to use it. In the first respect I observe, that

The armor of God is a complete armor, Doct. 4. The armor of God is
complete.
every way sufficient: sufficient to defend us in every part, and sufficient to
keep off and thrust back every assault, and every dart of our spiritual
enemies. For the first, if we well note the particular pieces of this armor
hereafter described, we shall find the Christian soldier armed from top to
toe: For the last, Verse. 16.
the Apostle says of one piece, that by it all the fiery darts of the wicked
may be quenched: if by one piece, much more by every piece jointly together,
may all assaults be repelled. Hence it is that the 2 Timothy 3. 17.
Scripture which prescribes this armor, is able to make the man of God
absolute.

This armor being of God, Reason.
it must needs be complete, or else question might be made of his power, as if
he were not able to provide sufficient armor; or of his providence, as if he
cared not to have his soldiers well armed; or of his goodness, as if he were
not moved with the wounds and foyles of his servants, which for want of good
armor they must needs receive: but Gods power, providence and goodness being
without all defect, we may conclude that this armor of God is complete.

Never were any of the Saints so sufficiently armed: Object. 1.
for the Devil has still found some part or other unfenced, even in the best;
and thereby wounded them. Instance, Genesis 9. 21.
Noah, and 19. 33.
Lot, and 16 4.
Abraham, 2 Samuel 11. 4.
David, Mat. 26. 70.
Peter, etc.

Ans. The fault was not in the insufficiency of their armor, but in the
negligent and careless use thereof, as if a soldier which has very good
armor of proof, every way complete, should either not at all, or very
loosely put on his head-peece, or breast plate, or any other piece: and this is
evident, because in such parts where some were wounded, other were well fenced.
Noah and some other failed in the use of their breast plate of righteousness:
Peter failed in holding out his shield of faith. If the fault were in the
armor, either in the weakness or want of this or that piece, then would the
Devil without fail foil every Christian in one and the same part.

Get this complete armor.
if at leaft he have any care of his limbs and life, will not be quiet till
he has got good and complete armor of proof. How careful was Saul well to
furnish David when he was to enter combat with Goliath? rather then he should
want, 1 Samuel 17. 38.
Saul was ready to have afforded him his own, if it had been fit. Lo here
is the complete armor of God, sufficient to keep us safe: let us first
labor to get it.

Be confident in it.
because it is of proof, and complete. It was this armor that made David so
confident against 1 Samuel 17. 45
Goliath, though he had no outward armor on him. They who are well armed, and
yet faint hearted, dishonor him that gave them their armor, abuse the gift it
self, and make themselves ridiculous to all that see or know them.

. 6. The armor of God to be used.
HItherto have we handled the means appointed for our safety: now we are to
declare how this armor is to be used. Put on the whole armor.

Here are two points to be noted, 1. That we put on armor. 2. That we put on
whole armor.


This word put on, is a word of practice, by which the Apostle follows his
former metaphor, taken from soldiers which are in the field: they do not as
householders in the time of peace, let their armor hang on the walls without
use of it, till it rust, but they make use of it by putting it on, wearing it,
and putting it to the proof; so

Christians ought to be well furnished always, Doct. 5. The graces of God to
be employed.
and well prepared with the graces of Gods Spirit: they must ever have them in
readiness at hand to use them, and make proof of them. In this sense is this
Romans 13. 12.
phrase of putting on often used, and Col. 3. 12. 1 These. 5. 8.
applied to many particular graces, yea to Romans 13. 14.
Christ himself, whereby is implied, that we should apply Christ unto our
selves, and so make use of him, and of all his actions and sufferings: yea also
of all those graces, which he conueyeth into us. Other Metaphors are also used
to set forth the same point: 2 Timothy 1. 6. (...).
stir up the gift of God which is in thee (says the Apostle.) The Metaphor
is taken from a fire, which is of little use when it is covered over and
smothered up with ashes, but stirred and blown up, it is of great use. Again,
our Lord uses another Metaphor to the same purpose, Mat. 12. 35.
A good man (says he) brings forth good things. As a wise man that has
store of treasure will not let it lie rusting and cankering in his chest, (this
is a note of a covetous miser, who were as good be without treasure as have
abundance, for he wants in his greatest abundance, because he uses not that
he has) but brings forth and imployeth it for his own and others good: so
does a good man with the treasure of grace which God has bestowed on him.
Excellent Metaphors to illustrate and urge this point.

All the benefit and good of a thing comes from the use of it: Reason.
as armor rusting by the walls side, as fire smothered with ashes, as money
cankering in chests, so are the graces of Gods Spirit, if they be not employed:
though in themselves they be never so excellent, yet to us and others they are
fruitless and unprofitable, without a right use of them. This David, no doubt,
well knew, and therefore Psalm. 40. 10.
hid not Gods righteousness in his heart.

A deceit to think a man may have armor, and yet none seen upon him.
please themselves therein, and yet show forth no practice thereof: knowledge
they have, and well are they able to discourse of the kinds of graces, and of
the differences betwixt current and counterfeit grace, as also of the many
wiles of Satan, and of the means to avoid them, and yet no proof do they
give of the soundness of any grace in themselves. For example, many imagine
that they have very good and sound faith, and yet live altogether by sense: for
while all things go well, according to their desire, they can believe and
depend upon God: but when any cross falls upon them, then their shield of
faith is to seek, every dart pierces them to the very heart. Other conceit
they have a good breast plate of righteousness, and yet no practice of piety,
none of charity, to be observed in them. They are like those of whom Saint
James Iam. 2. 16.
speaks, that can say to such as are naked and destitute of daily food, be
you warmed and filled, notwithstanding they give them not those things which
are needful for the body.

Let us for our parts make proof of the graces we have: what armor we seem
to have, let it be seen on our backs. Make proof of what thou have.
Think we that we have the shield of faith? Let us live by our faith, Heb. 11.
as the Patriarchs did: or the breast plate of righteousness? Job 29. 14.
Let it cover us as a robe: let us be so conscionable in practicing the
several duties thereof, that with the testimony of a good conscience we may
say to God as Nehemiah did, Neh. 5. 19.
Remember me, O my God, in goodness for all that I have done for thy people.
Or the girdle of verity? let us so uprightly and sincerely behave our selves,
as we may with comfort say with honest Hezechiah, Isa. 38. 3.
Lord remember how I have walked before thee in truth. Thus may the general
doctrine be applied in all the particular branches of this Christian armor:
which that we may the rather do, note what is further required: that the whole
armor be put on.

. 7. Every grace to be used.
AS this particle, whole, is annexed to armor, to commend unto us the
sufficiency of the armor of God, whereof we have heard before: so this
compound word, whole armor, is inferred upon that action of putting on, to
teach us, that it is not sufficient to put on some parts and pieces thereof,
but every part and piece, the whole armor must be put on. From the true scope
of the Apostles meaning, I gather that,

The power of every sanctifying grace must be manifest in the life of a
Christian. Doct. 6. Every grace to be manifested.
This was it whereunto he exhorted before, saying, Ephesians. 4. 15. expounded.
Let us in all things grow up, etc. There he uses a Metaphor taken from the
members of a natural body, implying that spiritual graces are to the spirit,
as fleshly members to a body; now if the body grow in some parts only, and not
in every part proportionably, (as if it should grow all in the head, and not
answerably in the legs, or all in the shoulders, and not at all in the thighs)
it would be but a monstrous body: or if it abound with noisome humors, which
make it swel in some parts, those humors will be so far from preserving the
body, that they will rather impair the health, and shorten the life of it. So
if a Christian shall be hot in faith, and cold in love; or have great
knowledge, and show little obedience: or be full of devotion, and empty of
discretion, surely he is a monstrous Christian: the want of some graces make
the other to be of no use. Such professors are a shame and dishonor to others;
they are full of noisome and distempered humors, which will destroy that show
of spiritual life which they seem to have. Fitly may they be compared to Dan.
2. 32. etc.
Nebuchadnezzars Image, whose head was of gold, but his feet of iron and clay:
what was the end of that Image? the feet thereof were smitten, and so all broken
together. Such is like to be the end of al monstrous Christians.

But is it possible that any one Christian should have all sanctifying graces?
Question.


Yea verily, Answer.
it is not only possible, but also necessary that not only any one, but
every one be endued with every kind of sanctifying grace, which appertains
to the essential being of a Christian. For regeneration is as perfect in the
kind thereof, as our natural birth.

Men ordinarily are borne with all the parts and members of a man: if not, they
are either monsters, or at least imperfect: but in the spiritual birth, which
is (...). John. 3. 3.
from above, even and 1. 13.
of God, there is no imperfection of parts, there are no monsters: all that are
borne of the Spirit, have all the essential parts of the Spirit; and thus are
al alike, though not in measure, yet in number of graces. For as the flesh has
corrupted every power of the soul and part of the body, so does the Spirit
renew every power and part of both. The Apostle testifies of the Corinthians,
that 1. Cor. 1. 5, 7.
in all things they were made rich, and not destitute of any gift.

Forceable and weighty motives there are to urge this point, Reasons.
as

God makes nothing in vain.
whole armor must be put on. If a careful and wise Captain should provide
sufficient armor for all his soldiers, and some of them be careless in
putting on every piece thereof, might he not be offended with them, and that
justly? Much more should we provoke God, by neglecting any thing which he in
his good providence has provided for us.

Every grace needful.
we lie open to our enemies, even as if we had put on never a piece: for they
are very subtle, they narrowly view us on every side, and soon can epsy if
any part be naked. What if a soldier have an helmet and want a breast plate, if
a dart light upon his breast, and pierce to his heart, what good gets he by
his head-peece? Or if he have a breast plate, and want a girdle to knit it
close, or tassets and cushes to cover his belly? Thus if faith, or hope, or
righteousness, or verity, or any other part of the Christian armor be
wanting, the Devil can thereby take his advantage to destroy the soul: so as
not only duty to God, but safety of our selves may move us to put on the
whole armor.

Who have not every grace, have never a grace.
is made by the concurrence and meeting of al together. Single graces, that is,
graces which stand alone, are counterfeit graces. Faith without righteousness is
presumption: righteousness without truth is hypocrisy, and so in the rest. Al
come from the same fountain: he that has not all, has none at all.

How needful is it that we follow the counsel of 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, etc.
Saint Peter, Add grace to grace.
to knowledge faith, to faith hope, to hope righteousness, to righteousness
truth, to truth patience, and so in the rest? Thus will it not repent the Lord
to have provided whole armor for us, when we shall use all. Thus shall we give
no advantage to our spiritual enemies; thus shall we have evident proof of
the Spirits abode in us, and be assured that indeed we are borne anew.

. 8. Man's endeavor to be added to Gods assistance.
THe two general parts of the Apostles direction have hitherto been
distinctly handled: now let us consider them jointly together. The first part
is that we be strong in the Lord. The second, that we use those means which
God has appointed for our safety. Whence observe, that

Gods assistance and man's endeavor concur together: Doct. 7. they may not be
severed. Gods assistance and man's endeavor are joined together.
Without Gods mighty power man can do nothing: unless man put on the whole
armor of God, God will do nothing. This the Church knew right well, Cant. 1.
3.
and therefore both prays unto God to be enabled by him ( draw me) and also
promises to do her uttermost endeavor, and follow his direction ( we will
run after thee.) The like we read of Psalm. 119. 31.
David: but most clearly is this point laid down by Ioh. 6. 44, 45.
Christ, who having said, No man can come to me, except the Father draw him,
(whereby he shows that God must enable man to come to him) adds, Every man
that has learned of the Father comes to me, (whereby he shows, that man
enabled of God, adds his own endeavor.)

Why Gods powerful work is necessary, Reasons.
has been showed before on verse. 10. namely, because of our own utter
inabilitie to do any thing of our selves. Ephesians. 2. 5.
Before God quickens us, we are dead in sins, no more able to do any
spiritual function, then a dead corpse to do any natural function: yea,
after we are quickened, we are 1. Cor. 15. 10.
still supported by Gods grace, which works in us: yet being quickened we
must do our endeavor, because of that order which the Lord has in wisdom
appointed to bring us to glory.

For this end does God work in us both to will, and to do, that we should
work out our own salvation, Phil. 2. 12. 13. Non sicut in lapidibus
inse^satis, etc. Deus salutem nostram operatur. Aug. cont. Pel de pec. rem.
lib. 2. cap. 5.
God works not upon us, as upon stocks or stones, but gives to us life and
ability, as when he raised the Widows son, the Rulers daughter, and
Lazarus, he put life into them, and enabled them to move, rise up, walk,
eat, and do other functions of the living.

Papists attribute too much to man's will.
The Papists to establish their own power and strength, hold and teach, that
after the first motion and stirting of the heart, which they acknowledge to be
of God only, Bell, de great. l. 5. c. 29. potest homo absolute per liberum
arbitrium benefacere sivelit.
a man absolutely by his free will may do well if he will. But Christ says
of the branches which were in the vine, whose hearts were stirred up, John 15.
5.
Without me ye can do nothing.

The care which the Apostle has to direct them unto the fountain of strength,
the Lord, even then when especially he urges them to arm themselves, argues
that without continual strength supplied unto them from the Lord, they are not
able to stand of themselves against the assaults of their enemies.

Libertines fall into another extreme, Libertines too careless in doing what
they ought.
they, to pamper their flesh, and pursue their carnal delights, so refer all
to the work and power of God, that they are altogether careless in using any
means themselves, upon conceit that God is able of himself to save them, and
that when God pleases he will save them, do they in the mean time what they
list. But fondly they argue from Gods power, who neglect the means which God
has appointed and revealed, wherein and whereby he will manifest his power.
Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
His revealed will is the ground of our faith and obedience: if we follow the
direction of it, then may we safely trust unto the power of God; otherwise in
attributing all to the grace of God, we abuse it, and Jude verse. 4.
turn it into want onnesse. Were it not necessary for us to do what God
enableth us to do, as well as trust to the power of Gods might, the Apostle
needed not have been thus careful in stirring us up to arm our selves.

Jerusalem; Mat. 23. 37. Totum ex Deo, non tamen quasi dormientes, non quasi vt
non conemur, etc. sine voluntate tua non erit in te iustitia Dei, etc. qui
fecit te fine te, non te iustificat sine te, etc. Aug. de verb. Apo. sermon. 15.
How often would I have gathered thy children together, and ye would not? Be
we not like to them, lest we be rejected as they were: Know we this for
certain, that God will not with cart-ropes by force and violence, against our
wills draw us to Heaven.

To this end does God take out of us that stony and inflexible heart which is
in us by nature, and gives us an heart of flesh which is flexible, that it
being made pliable by Gods Spirit, should apply it self to Gods work, as
David did, Psalm. 119. 112. The truth is, that many Christians are wonderfully
wounded and foiled by the Enemy, because of their own idleness and
security, in that they are backward in putting forth themselves, and negligent
in endeavoring to do what God inableth them to do.

Lo here is complete armor of God provided for our defense and safety; be
we careful in putting it on and well using it.

Thus much for the means to be used.

. 8. The end and benefit of Christian armor.
THe end why this means is to be used, follows in these words; That ye may
be able to stand, etc. In setting down this end, he declares the benefit of
the fore named armor, (...).
which is an ability to stand, amplified by the enemy against whom we stand,
the Devil, and his subtlety, in this word, wyles.

The Apostle still follows and continues his Metaphor taken from Soldiers,
who being every way well fenced and prepared against their enemies, stand
stoutly against them, neither fall down, fly away, nor give ground. (...).
Wherefore this word stand, is a word of safety and freedom from danger; yea,
of victory and conquest, implying, that they which are well prepared with the
armor of God, so long as they well use it, can neither be slain, nor taken
captives, nor beaten down, nor made to fly, nor yet foiled or put back, and
forced to give ground, but stand fast and safe upon their ground, yea stand
fast in the field when their enemies are driven away, and so remain
Conquerors, as we shall Verse 13.
after hear. And this is all the conquest which in this world we can look
for, to keep our selves safe, that we be not conquered or foiled, and that we
give no advantage to our enemies. As for the utter subduing of the Devil and
his host, that belongs to Christ our Captain and Champion.

This safe standing being laid down as the end why this armor of God is
given, and declaring the benefit which follows upon the well using of the
armor, these two Doctrines naturally flow from thence,

1. There is no hope, Doct. 8.
no possibility of remaining safe without spiritual armor.

2. They who well put on the armor of God, Doct. 9. and use it as they ought,
are safe and sure, and so may be secure.

. 9. Who are without armor, can have no hope to stand.
FOr the first, No safety without armor.
that which the Prophet says of one piece of this armor, the shield of faith,
I may well apply to the whole armor, if ye have it not on you, Isa. 7. 9.
Surely ye shall not be established, ye cannot stand.

Without this armor we are naked, Reason 1.
and lie open to every dart and shot of our spiritual enemies: and are no more
able to free our selves from the power of the Devil, then a poor silly Lamb
or Kid from a roaring Lion or ravenous Bear. If being unfenced, we stand safe,
it must be either by reason of the goodness of the Devil, that he pittieth
us, and cannot find in his heart to take any advantage against us; or of his
carelessness and blindness, that he prieth not about us, or observes when,
and where we are fenced or naked; or of his weakness, that he is not able to
pierce and wound us, though we be naked: but such is his malice, his
subtlety, and sedulitie; such also his power (as we shall after hear) that
none can imagine there should be any such goodness, carelessness, blindness,
or weakness in him.

Besides, Reason 2.
by neglecting to use this armor provided of God, we provoke God to cast us
into the power of our enemies, and to give them power over us, 1 King. 22. 20,
21, etc.
as he dealt with Ahab.

Many ouerbold.
they can be as safe and sure, and may be as secure as they who have the whole
armor on them; much like to the seven sons of Sceua, who ouerboldly ventured
to adjure an evil spirit ( Acts 19. 14, 15, 16.) but what was the issue? being
unarmed they could not stand, they were overcome and forced to fly.

Many think there needs no such care about faith, righteousness,
sincerity, etc. as some do take:

For ought they see, Object.
they are most assaulted and most foiled, who are most busy and diligent in
putting on this armor, and fitting it to them.

To grant that they which put on this whole armor of God are most assaulted,
Answer.
because the Devil without any great assaulting, preuailes against such as
have it not on; I utterly deny that they are most foiled: for they who are
without it are clean vanquished, and in the power of the Devil, which the
other never shall be.

Yea but say they, Object. 2.
we find and feel no such matter, we are very quiet, no way molested.

I easily believe it: Answer.
but what is the reason? because the Devil has them in his power, he needs
not eagerly pursue them.

Miserable is that rest and quiet which they have: Simil.
even like to that which the poor Kid has, when it is brought into the Lions
den, or the Mouse when it is in the Cats mouth, the Cat can play with the Mouse
when she has once caught it: and the Lion can let the Kid lie quiet in his
den, while he rangeth and roreth after that prey which is out of his clutches.
But what security of life have these that are so taken? their security is,
that they are sure to be gnawed to pieces and devoured. This is the case of
those who being destitute of the armor of God, yet think themselves quiet and
well. They are fast bound with the chains of sin, and wholly in the Devils
power, where he cease to molest them for a while, but rather dallieth with
them, while he eagerly pursues such as have on this armor, and are out of his
power, and stand manfully against him. Against these he casts all the darts
he can, but all in vain, as the next Doctrine shows.

. 10. Who well use their armor are sure to stand.
THey who well put on the armor of God, Doct. 9.
and use it as they ought, They are safe who well use the armor of God.
are safe and sure, and may be secure. Saint Peter exhorting Christians to
seek after such graces as may be comprised under this armor, expressly says,
2 Pet. 1. 10.
If ye do these things, ye shall never fall. Saint John says of one piece
of this armor, namely faith, that 1 John 5. 4.
it is the victory which overcomes the world. What then may be said of this
whole armor, of every piece of it together? Saint Paul goes yet further, and
says of himself, and of other Christians like himself, who have put on this
armor, Romans 8. 37.
We are more then Conquerers.

The points which have bin before delivered, Reasons.
that this is complete armor, the complete and whole armor of God, do
sufficiently confirm this point.

put on the whole armor of God. This is the maine end which the Apostle aims
at in laying down this end, Be persuaded to use this armor.
to show that as this is armor of proof in it self, so it will sufficiently
defend us, and keep us harmless. If at any time we be foiled, the fault is
our own, we can blame none but our selves, because the Lord gives such
means whereby we may be able to stand. Is it a benefit to stand fast and
safe? Is it a matter to be desired to be kept free from spiritual wounds and
hurts, yea from eternal bondage and slavery under sin, Satan, and other
mortal enemies of our souls? and from everlasting torment and torture that
follows thereupon? (how blind are they which see it not! how foolish are
they which regard it not!) If this (I say) be a benefit, then take notice of
the means whereby we may be enabled to stand fast in that liberty which
Christ has purchased for us, and made free from the forenamed slavery: and
withal make conscience, and give all diligence to use the means aright. It is
a point of notorious folly to be desirous of a thing, and careless in doing
that whereby our desire may be accomplished. Yea, it is a cunning wile of the
Devil in good things to make men separate the means from the end, but in
evil the end from the mean; as to make men desire and look for the good and
happy end of righteousness, and yet be backward in walking in that way that
leads thereto: and contrariwise, eagerly and swiftly to run in the way of
sin, and yet not fear the wages of sin, and the Issue of that course. In
the first kind Balaam was deceived. Numb. 23. 10.
In the second Euah was deluded. Balaam desired to dye the death of the
righteous; but careless he was in leading such a life as brought forth such
a death. Genesis 3. 4.
Euah was persuaded she should not dye, and yet feared not to eat of that
fruit, Genesis 2. 17.
against which death was denounced. Let the fearful end of both these make us
wise against these wiles. Worldly men are wise enough herein, if they observe a
good benefit to be had, they will seek how it may be obtained, and do with
all diligence that whereby it may be obtained. This makes them to pass over
Sea and Land to get such commodities as their own Land affords not: this
makes them when they fear enemies, to have all warlike provision ready; often
to muster their men, to keep continual watch and ward at their chief
port-townes, with the like. To stand.
Now this end here laid down, being a matter of so great consequence (for if
we stand not fast, but suffer our selves to be foiled and overcome, no less
damage and danger follows thereof, then loss of eternal happiness on the
one side, and utter destruction on the other.) Why should we be more foolish in
spiritual matters, then worldlings are in temporal? They indeed are more
sensible of temporal things, whether good, or evil. Let us therefore in
spiritual matters give the better heed to the direction of Gods word: that
faith may make us as wise, as sense makes them.

. 11. Satan our adversary.
THe necessity and benefit of this armor will be better manifested, if we
shall duly weigh who is our enemy, and 1 pt. 5. 8.
what his assaults be?

The enemy, Doct. 10. The Devil ou^ enemy.
against whom we are made able by the whole armor of God to stand, is the
Devil. Thus is he called our 1 Pet. 5. 8.
Adversary, Mat. 13. 39.
Enemy, Matthew. 4. 3.
Tempter, John 8. 44.
Murderer etc. Much might be spoken of the creation, nature, fall, and many
other points of the Devil: but I will content my self with such points as may
most serve for our present purpose, which is to show how fearful and terrible
an enemy he is.

. 12. Satan a terrible enemy.
FOr the better understanding whereof, What Devils were by creation.
know, that the Devils by creation were good Angels, as powerful, wise,
quick, speedy, invisible, immortal, etc. as any other Angels: equal in
every respect, but inferior in no respect to the very best Angels.

When they fell they lost not their natural substance, What they lost by their
fall.
and essential properties thereof, no more then man lost his when he fell: for
as man remained to be not only flesh and blood, but also a living, yea and a
reasonable creature after his fall, so the Devil remains to be a spirit,
invisible, immortal, quick, speedy, etc. as before: only the quality of
his nature and properties is altered from good to evil: as powerful as he was
before to good, so powerful is he now to evil; invisible and quick he is,
wonderful close and speedy in working mischief, he was not more desirous of
good before his fall, then since he is mischievous, and even set upon evil.

There are four especial things which make the Devil very fearful; What
makes them terrible


First, his power. Secondly, his malice. Thirdly, his subtlety. Fourthly, his
sedulitie and speed.

Who fears not a powerful enemy? This made 1 Samuel 17. 11.
Goliath seem so terrible. If an enemy be malicious, even for his malice he
is feared as 1 Samuel 22. 22
Doeg: or if he be crafty and subtle, for which 2 Samuel 15. 31
Achitophel was feared: yea also the enemies of Israel were accounted fearful
in regard of their swiftness, Isa. 5. 26.
That they came hastily with speed. How terrible will all these make an
enemy, when they all meet together? It may be thought that if an enemy be
malicious, and wants power, he may consume himself with malice, and do
little hurt to others: or if he be powerful and malicious, but want wit,
craft, and subtlety, he may like an unbridled Horse run on headlong in
his powerful malice to his own ruin and destruction: or though to his power
and malice, subtlety be also added, yet if he be slow and careless, he is
the less feared, in hope that he may be prevented in all his enterprises. But
where malice is strengthened by might, might whetted on by malice; both malice
and power guided by craft, craft and all stirred up by diligence, sedulitie,
and speed, who can stand against such an enemy?

Now all these do in a very high degree concur in the Devil, as 1 Pet. 5. 8.
Expounded.
Saint Peter does notably set them down in this description of the Devil;
Your adversary the Devil like a roaring Lion walks about, seeking whom to
devour. His name (...)
Devil, and that which he seeks for, to devour, shows his malice. The
beast whereunto he is resembled, Lion, shows his power and craft, and the
attribute, roaring, adds terror thereunto: lastly, his walking up and down,
shows his sedulitie. Of his power, malice and sedulitie, I shall have occasion
more distinctly to speak on the 12. verse.

. 13. The Devils wiles.
Satan's subtlety is here particularly expressed under this word, Satan's
subtlety.
wyles. The Greek word signifies artificial, crafty, (...) etc. Chrysostom.
cunning conueyances of matters, windings up and down, and turning every way
to get the greatest advantage. Fitly is this word used by the Apostle, for his
temptations and assaults are very cunning, full of much deceit, of many
windings, which make him so mightily prevail against the greatest sort of the
world, even against all that are not strong in the Lord, and wise in well using
the whole armor of God.

The titles which in Scripture are given to the Devil, do evidently imply his
great craft. He is termed a Dragon, and a Serpent, which of al other beasts are
counted the craftiest, and Genesis 3. 1. Mat. 10. 16.
wisest: yea to show that he has had long time of experience to make him the
more subtle and crafty: he is called an Reu. 12. 3, 9. (...) quasi (...)
guarus, peritus. Plat. in Crat.
old Serpent, a great red Dragon. There are names in Greek which we ordinarily
translate Devil, that yet further signify his great subtilty, for they note
out his great knowledge and unexperienced skill.

As his names are, so is his practice, full of many windings, full of much
craft. It is an infinite task, a matter of impossibility to discover all his
cunning straragems and subtle devices. He has old tricks, which long he
has used, because by long continued experience, he has found that silly men
are soon deceived with them, and that the harm of some cannot warn others:
and yet does he daily invent new upon new, ever shifting from one to another:
if one will not serve, he has another presently in a readiness. For diverse
persons, diverse conditions, and dispositions, he has diverse temptations.
Sometimes he plays the part of a roaring ravenous Lion: sometimes of a
crafty fawning Fox: sometimes appearing in his own shape, sometimes changing
himself into an Angel of light, doing any thing for his advantage. Because
the Apostle holds himself close to the metaphor taken from war, I will also
follow it, and under it discover some few particular stratagems, leaving it to
the particular meditation of others to find out other.

1. He can well tell how to marshall and set his army in array; Satan's shifts.
he well knows how to order his temptations: For first he uses to make the
onset with light skirmishes and to begin with small temptation; and then by
degrees to follow with greater and mightier forces. Thus came he to Gen 3. 1.
Eve; first only he made a question whether God had forbidden them any of the
trees: and then by degrees he came Genesis 3. 4.
directly to contradict the express word of God. So when he tempted Christ,
Mat. 4. 3. 9.
he began with a doubt whether Christ were the Son of God or no, and lastly
tempted him to monstrous idolatry.

Thus he makes men careless at the first, and his temptation lightly to be
regarded, till he have gotten some advantage; which when he has gotten, he
will follow with all the might and maine that possibly he can.

2 If thus he prevail not, but at first he be put back, he can change his
ranckes and weapons: he can alter his temptations, and begin with fierce and
violent assaults. Thus he set on Job 1. 13. etc. and 2. 7.
Job. If he cannot seduce men by moving them to make light account of sin, he
will persuade them that every sin is most heinous, that their sins are
unpardonable. If he cannot make them superstitious, he will strive to make
them profane: and thus help one temptation with another.

3. If he observe the forces of the Lords Soldiers to be strong and well
ordered and fortified, then his endeavor will be pollitikely to allure some
out of their rancks, and so make a breach; it seems that thus he prevailed
much, and got great advantage in the Church of Corinth. For thus he bred 1
Cor. 1 11.
Schisms and contentions among them. Whereupon the Apostle exhorts Ibid. 7.
20.
every man to abide in the same vocation wherein he was called. Thus in these
our days has he caused must trouble in Gods Churches by the inordinate
walking of many persons; who leaving their own places, have caused divisions,
sects, and separations from the Church.

4. If he observe some provident Captain, watchful over the Lords armies,
and careful to keep his soldiers in good order, animating and encouraging
them, then will the Devil use the 1 King. 22. 31
King of Arams stratagem: all his forces shall be bent against that Captain.
Thus he fiercely set upon our chief Captain Matthew. ^.
in the wilderness, and throughout the whole course of his life; but
especially Mat. 26. 37.
in the Garden, and and 27. 46.
on the Cross. Thus did he desire to Luke 22. 31.
winow the Apostles: Thus does he sorely tempt Magistrates, Ministers, and such
as have charge over others.

5. If he prevail not against them, rather then fail, he will set upon the
weakest. Thus dealt he by the ministry of Heretics, who 2 Timothy 3. 6.
led captive simple weomen. And thus in our days deals he by the ministry
of Papists, Anabaptists, Separatists, and all other Sectaries.

6. If by none of these means he can accomplish his plots, as he desires,
face to face, or force against force, then will he lay some secret ambushments
or other, to set on the Lords soldiers unawares behind their back, like to
that stratagem of Jos 8. 4.
Ioshuah, and of Judge. 20. 29.
the Israelites: as when he suffers Christians to go on in doing the work of
the Lord, and performing such duties as belong unto them, but will come
behind, and cast into their hearts some conceits of merit and pride. Thus he
gave 2 Cor. 12. 7.
Paul a backe-blow. Thus he overcomes the Papists, and many ignorant persons
among us. Sometimes also he will cast lustful and worldly thoughts and cares
into them, and so Mat. 13. 22.
choke all.

7. If the Lords soldiers be so circumspect, as neither by force nor fraud he
can prevail, he will not stick to change his flag: and seem to fight under
the Lords banner, as Ez 4. 4. Neh. 6. 2.
Tobiah, Sanballat, and other deadly enemies of the Jews endeavored to do.
In this respect the Apostle says, that is 2 Cor. 11. 13, 14, 15.
Satan transformeth himself into an Angel of light, and his Ministers into
the Apostles of Christ. Thus oftentimes he prevails with such as are of
tender consciences to make many needless scruples, by accounting such things
to be sin, which Gods word never made sin, and by thinking many things to
be necessary duties, which belong not at all unto them.

Thus have we a taste of some of his wiles, I will not further range forth
into this spacious field, lest I be too tedious.

See Doct. 3. of verse. 10.
and in the power of his might? this enemy having so many wyles, had we not
need be always prepared with the whole arm or of God? assuredly if we be not
strong in the power of Gods might, there is no standing against the Devil. If
at any time we be without the whole armor of God, doubtless we shall soon be
overtaken with some of his wiles.

Devil and his wyles, commend unto us the provident care of God over us, who
keeps us safe from such an enemy, and from such wiles? and how does it set
forth the excellency of the forenamed whole armor of God? Very excellent
must needs that armor be, which is able to keep us safe from so potent and
malicious an enemy, who has so many wiles to deceive us. This shows it to
be very complete and every way sufficient, for while we have it on, well
fitted to us, all the craft of the Devil cannot find a naked place where to
wound us, his strength is not able to pierce it; no though his craft and
strength be both whetted on with malice. Is there not now great reason we
should put it on and always keep it on? that we neither wake, nor sleep, be
alone, or in company without it?

us somewhere unarmed, and sometime unprepared (for otherwise we are safe.)
Gods word is able to afford unto us wisdom enough to avoid his wiles. For
Psalm. 119. 98
David thereby was made wiser then his enemies. Let us therein exercise our
selves, and withal pray with 2 Samuel 15. 31
David, that God would turn the wiles and counsels of the Devil into
foolishness: For 1 Cor. 3. 19.
God catches the wise in their own craftiness.

THE THIRD PART.
The reason why we must be well armed.
Ephesians. 6. 12. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
Principalities, against Powers, against worldly Governors, Princes of the
darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly things.
. 1. The coherence.
IN this verse is laid down the motive which the Apostle uses, to urge the
forenamed direction. It may have a double reference First, general to the
former exhortation, Be strong, etc. yea, and put on the whole armor, etc.
because we have such enemies as are here described. Secondly, particular to
the last clause of the former verse, where he showed that we were to stand
against the Devil, so it serves as an amplification of them: for if the
question be asked, what is the Devil, that we should be so prepared against
him? these words set him forth; not flesh and blood, but principalities, etc.
The first particle ^n.
for, being a causall particle, which intimates a reason, implies the first
reference: the immediate connection of this verse upon the last clause of the
former verse, implies the second. Both may well stand together: for both
import one and the same thing: namely, that because we have so dreadful and
deadly enemies, we ought to be well prepared against them.

. 2. Danger makes watchful.
FRom the inference then of this verse, and from the force of the Apostles
argument, I collect, that The greater danger we are subject unto, Doct. 1.
the more watchful and careful we must be for our safety. The more danger we
are in, the more watchful we must be.
When Christ observed what a sore agony he was to enter into, he did not only
watch and pray himself, but called upon his Disciples to Mat. 26. 38, 40, 41.
watch and pray: and because they did not, he rebuked them for their
sluggishnesse. Saint 1 Pet. 5. 8.
Peter urges this duty of watchfulness upon a like reason; namely, because
we have so fearful an enemy* Ios. 9. 12, etc. and 10. 1, 2, etc.
Outward temporal dangers make natural men watchful and careful for their
temporal estates and lives, as the histories of all times and ages show. Seeing
then that spiritual dangers are much more fearful, ought we not to be much
more careful?

If we be, Reason
we do not only show that we have regard of our souls, and seek the good of
them, but also we shall procure much good unto them, and prevent and keep away
much mischief from them.

clean contrary to this inference of the Apostle, and the wisdom thereby
taught us; and that in two extremes: one of presumption, the other of
despair: for some, when they hear of such enemies as are here described,
they do too vainly, carelessly, and proudly contemn them, like Judges 9. 28.
Gaal: other too meanly, basely, and slauishly dread them, like Isa. 7. 2.
Ahaz.

. 3. Against presumption.
THe former extreme, Presumption arises from
which is presumption, arises partly from too great a conceit of our selves,
and of our own strength; and partly from too light credence and belief of
that which is recorded of the Devil.

That self-conceit makes us fondly imagine that we are well able to resist
all temptations of the Devil, 1. Self conceit.
or any of his instruments: whereupon many are ready to lay (when they are
exhorted to take heed of the Devil, and of his strong temptations) I defy the
Devil and all his wicked crew, he can do no hurt to me: I can (I thank God)
easily avoid his temptations the gates of hell cannot prevail against me; and
yet proud silly fools, they are overtaken and overcome with every slight
temptation. Luke 22. 33. 56. 57.
Peter (though otherwise a man of good gifts) was somewhat too conceited of
himself, and too much inclined to this extreme, and yet when he was to stand
to it, a silly wench daunted him.

Light credence makes us think the Devil cannot be so terrible, 2.
Incredulity
as he is set forth to be; but that the things which are written and said of
him and his wiles, are but as scarcrowes and bugbeares to make men afraid, like
to old tales of the walking of spirits, of fairies, hobgoblins, etc. This
incredulity much hinders the power of such exhortations, directions,
admonitions and rebukes, which are given us for our good. Both Peter and the
other Disciples were somewhat tainted here with: for when Mat. 26. 31. etc.
Christ told them all, Ioh. 13. 36, etc.
that all of them should be offended by him, and that Peter in particular
should deny him, none of them would believe it: Peter says, Though all should,
yet he would never: and again, though he should die, yet would he not deny
Christ: and so said all the Disciples.

. 4. Against Despair.
THe latter extreme which is Despair, Whence arise^h despair.
arises partly from too deep an apprehension of the power of the Devil (as
if his power were infinite, and he were able to do whatsoever his malice led
him unto, and so could do what he would: or unlimited, God letting the raines
loose unto him, and holding him in no further then he list himself, and so he
might do what he could, like an untamed horse that is not curbed and bridled
in) and partly from too light an esteem of that power which is to be had in
God, and of the great help and benefit which the whole armor of God
affords, as if God were not able to make us strong enough, nor that whole
armor sufficient to make us safe.

These two causes of despair made the Israelites often times utter most
desperate speeches against God: for when Number. 13. 29. 33 34.
they heard that in Canaan (the Land which was given them for inheritance) the
people were strong that there were men of great stature, and 14. 3 4. etc
even Grants therein, that the Cities were walled, and exceeding great, they
desperately expostulated with the Lord, why he brought them into that Land to
fall by the sword, and in despair of ever possessing Canaan, whou^d n^eds
return again into Egypt: and another time they plainly made doubt of Gods
power, saying, Psalm. 78. 19, 20.
Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? Can he give bread? As these
Israelites murmured against God, and made question of his power and truth in
performing his promises, in regard of their temporal enemies, whom they judged
to be too strong for them: so do many in regard of their spiritual enemies.
Thus we see how prone we are to pervert those things to our destruction,
which the Lord has set forth for our instruction. Here the Apostle lays
down both the means for our defense; and also the danger to which we are
subject, that we should be the more careful in arming our selves: we either
presumptuously defy our enemies, and care not to use any means of safeguard;
or else are too timerously daunted with our enemies, and think the Lords
defense can do us no good.

Wherefore that in hearing the great danger wherein we are by reason of our
enemies here described, we take not occasion thereby to fall into any of these
extremes, but rather the more carefully avoid them, and keep in the middle
way, which is, so much the more earnestly to fly unto the power of Gods might,
and so much the more carefully to keep fast on the whole armor of God; I
thought good beforehand to deliver this instruction, which naturally arises
from the force of the Apostles reasons.

Now come we more distinctly to handle the words themselves.

. 5. Exposition of the words.
IN this verse is a Description of a Christian combat. Verse 12. Sum.


The parts are two. In the first is noted the kind of combat, wrestle.

In the second are set forth the Combatants, or the Persons, which on either
side maintain the combat. These are on the one side Defendants; on the other
side Assaulters, which are largely described; and that both negatiuely, not
flesh and blood, and affirmatively, but principalities, etc.

The first point in order to be handled, is the kind of combat, implied under
this word wrestle. In the original it is thus set down word for word, (...).
There is a wrestling. We may not think that hereby is meant a matter of
sport, as our English word, wrestling, may seem to imply: for though the (...).
Greek word, as well as the English, be sometimes attributed to a strife of
sport, yet is it also used for a serious and fierce fight and combat. The
Greek word according to the proper (...) dicitur quia corpus (...) i, quatitur.
notation of it, signifies such a strife as makes the body of him that
strives to shake again.

It implies then that the combat here spoken of, is not a light skirmish,
with enemies aloof off, but a grapling with them hand to hand; and in that
respect the more fierce and dangerous. If they were far off from us, and aloof
should shoot or throw their weapons against us, we might think to epsy their
darts before they fall on us, or that they might miss of their aim: But the
combat being, as it were, a grapling hand to hand, all such hopes are taken
away: for they are near us to epsy where to annoy us, and so may assault us
the more fiercely.

. 6. The danger of a Christians combat.
Our spiritual war is a sore, fierce and dangerous war. Doct. 2.
It is a kind of combat which will try our prowess and courage, The
Christians werre a fierce war.
whereby proof will soon be made whether our armor be armor of proof or not,
or whether we have put on this whole armor. Mat. 4. 4. etc.
The truth of this was manifested in Christ our head, whom the devil hurried
from wilderness to pinnacle, from pinnacle to mountain: what the devil did to
Christ outwardly, and visibly, he uses to do to others inwardly and secretly.
The estate and condition of Christ while he lived on earth, is a lively
representation of the estate and condition of his Church in this world. Luke
22. 31.
Peter felt such a wrestling, so did 2 Cor. 12. 7.
Paul, so do all that slauishly yield not themselves to the power of the Devil.

Thus God orders our estate, Reasons.
1. The more to manifest and magnify the power of his might, and the
sufficiency of his armor. For the sorer the fight is, and the more dangerous,
2 Cor. 12. 9.
the greater does that strength appear to be, and the more excellent the
means whereby we are supported.

2. To make us with greater and stronger confidence to depend and rely upon
him, as 1 Samuel 30. 6.
David, and 2 Chr. 20. 12.
Iehosaphat.

3. To use the means appointed more carefully, as the Neh. 4. 16. 17
Jews who while they were working, were prepared against their enemies.

Trial.
that there be no wrestling, no fighting; or if any, now and then a light
skirmish, it is to be feared that our enemies have gotten possession of us, and
we slauishly have yielded to them, and so made Isa. 28. 15.
a covenant with them. Fierce combats do give us more assurance that the Lord
is still our God, and we his soldiers, then light or no assaults: for if the
Devil be our Lord, he can let us be quiet; but if our enemy, assuredly we
shall feel his hand.

The cause of fainting.
for it were no great matter to endure light and easy combats: but when we
come to be shaken indeed, then to stand fast is a token of extraordinary
courage: this was it which proved the Job 2. 3.
patience and courage of Job.

Think not that we have done enough, when we have passed over some light
trials, Prepare for great conflicts
but prepare for greater; we must come to a wrestling. Mark what the Apostle
says of them which had Heb. 10. 32, 36.
endured a great fight, Ye have need of patience; and again, and 12. 4.
Ye have not yet resisted unto blood.

Heb. 2. 14. 15
destroyed him that had the power of death, that he might deliver all them,
which for fear of death were all their life time subject to bondage: he Ephesians
4. 8.
has led captivity captive, and Col. 1. 13.
delivered us from the power of darkness, that we might be free from being
overcome, though not from wrestling.

. 7. None exempted from fight.
THe Defendants who maintain this wrestling are comprised under this particle
we, (...).
which includes himself and all like to himself, together with them to whom
he wrote, and all like unto them: so that

All of all sorts are to wrestle and fight this spiritual combat. Doct. 3.
Neither Ministers, All must fight
nor people, poor nor rich, male nor female, newly planted, nor old grown,
none of whatsoever rank, condition, estate, age, quality, etc. exempted.
Genesis 3. 15.
Whosoever is of the seed of the woman, must look to have his heel bruised.
There is enmity betwixt the two seeds; the Genesis 3. 1.
Devil spared not the woman which was the weaker vessel, and Matthew. 4. 3.
he feared not the head, Christ himself, who was the strongest of all. Who
may think to be spared? who can imagine that Satan will fear to wrestle with
him?

God will have all of all sorts to be tried: Reasons.
and the Devil bears a like hatred against all: 1 Pet. 5. 8.
he seeks whom to devour: so he may devour them, he cares not who they be:
as a Wolf spares none of the flock, ram, sheep or lamb that he can come
by.

All must apply the directions of the word.
Let not the weaker sort put them off upon conceit that fierce combats belong
to strong Christians; Satan having greatest hope to prevail against the
weakest, will not fail to set on them: nor yet let the stronger put them off,
upon conceit that the devil dares not meddle with them: for though there may
be some difference betwixt them and the weaker Christians, yet the strength of
the strongest is nothing in comparison of the devils might, if they come in
confidence of it, and not of the Lords strength, Besides, Satan, knowing that
their fall will prove a discouragement to others, will make the greatest
assaults against them.

Ministers preach to themselves.
which the Apostle here implies: for though his direction were in the second
person ( be ye strong, put ye on) yet he lays down the motive in the
first person ( we) to show that he was in as great danger as they, that he
stood in as great need of help as they; and that therefore the forenamed
directions belonged to him as well as to them. Acts 14. 15.
Ministers are men as well as others, subject to like passions as others. If
they preach not to themselves, what means of edification, of direction and
incourageme^t belongs unto them? Wherefore as people may not imagine that
these matters of spiritual warfare belong only to Ministers, as if they only
were the Lords soldiers, so neither may Ministers put them off from themselves
to the people, as if they were only to look on, and the people to fight; but
every one apply them to themselves.

. 8. Exposition of words.
WE have heard of the Defendants: Who are the challengers and assaulters? they
are set down negatiuely, not flesh and blood. For this particle not, has
reference to this latter clause, as if there were a comma betwixt wrestle and
not, thus, we wrestle, not with flesh, etc.

By flesh and blood, Who are flesh and blood.
are here meant such creatures as have a bodily substance which consists of
flesh and blood: in which respect man is termed Genesis 6. 3.
flesh, and Christ is said to be made John 1. 14.
flesh, because he had a corporal substance: herein a Luke 24. 39.
difference is made betwixt a Spirit, and a body.

Have we not then any enemies that have bodily substances in this spiritual
combat? Quest. 1.
are spirits only our enemies?

Romans 7. 23, 24.
Our own flesh is an enemy unto us. Answer.
Other men also are enemies: there are many adversaries, as infidels,
idolaters, heretics, 1 Cor. 16. 9. and 15. 32.
worldlings, all sorts of persecutors, yea and false brethren.

Why then is flesh and blood here excluded? Quest. 2.


They are not excluded, Answer.
for this negative clause is not to be taken simply, (...).
but

1 Comparatively, (...).
not so much with flesh and blood as with principalities. With these especially
we wrestle. Thus the Apostle forbids servants to Verse. 7.
serve men. Or not only with flesh and blood, but also with spirits: so says
Christ, Luke 14. 12.
call not thy friends to dinner, that is, not them alone, but the poor also.
Or not with flesh and blood alone, as it is in it self, weak and frail, but
set on work, assisted and guided by spirits. As if some English soldiers were
in pay under the Turk or Spaniard, against whom we maintain war, though
they be in battle against us, yet it might be said, we fight not with English
men.

2. By way of exposition, not with such as are weak, frail, foolish, visible
and mortal, as flesh and blood, Thus the horses of the Egyptians are called
Isai. 31. 3.
flesh, that is, weak, opposed to Spirit: so as this phrase not flesh and
blood, implies more, or other then flesh and blood.

. 9. How our spiritual enemies exceed flesh and blood.
Our most mortal enemies are more then flesh and blood, Doct. 4.
more in number, Our enemies more then flesh and blood.
greater in power, craftier in their wiles, of longer continuance, more
envious, malicious, furious, cruel, not so open and visible, but invisible,
close and secret, and in many other respects more fearful and dangerous.

1. Among flesh and blood, none so mighty but may be confronted: as Dan. 7. 3.
etc.
Daniels visions of the beasts shows. The great Monarchs of the world have
bin destroyed one of another, but no flesh and blood can confront the Devil.

2. Among flesh and blood none so politic, but they meet with some that at
length match, yea and out-reach them. Achitophel 2 Samuel 16. 23
whose counsel was counted as an oracle, and 17. 14.
was ouer-matched by Hushai: But all the wit of all the world cannot match the
subtlety of the Devil.

3. Suppose that among flesh and blood some be so mighty, as none mightier
then they, so subtle as none can go beyond them, yet are they flexible, and
may by fair means be persuaded and entreated to allay their fury, as 1 Samuel
25. 33
David by wise Abigail; yea, and wicked and 24. 17.
Saul by David's humbling of himself, and pleading his innocence: but there is
no such flexibility in the Devil, his malice will not suffer him to be moved,
unless for greater advantage.

4. Grant that some among men were implacable, yet their fury might be avoided
by flying from them, as 1 Samuel 21. 10
David avoided Saul's fury, 1 Kings 19. 3
Eliah Iezabels, Matthew. 2. 14.
Joseph and Mary, Herod's: From the Devils we cannot fly, they are every where,
they can soon overtake us.

5. But what if no means of escape could be gotten, but that needs we must be
subject to the rage of flesh and blood, yet in their greatest pride, power and
rage, they may be clean taken away by death, as Exodus 14. 28. etc.
Pharaoh and his host were drowned: Mat. 2. 20.
Herod the great died, and Acts 12. 23.
the other Herod who persecuted the Apostles: but our spiritual enemies are
not subject to death. I might in many other respects make comparison betwixt
flesh and blood on the one side, and Spirits on the other, and show how there
is no comparison betwixt them, that these are not flesh and blood, but much
more fearful.

Prou. 19. 12.
the wrath of a King (a King that is but flesh and blood) be like the roaring
of a Lion: Spiritual enemies are terrible.
if a man mighty in his own strength, as 1 Samuel 17. 11.
Goltah, be fearful: if a subtle man, as 2 Samuel 15 31.
Achitophel, cause doubt and dread: if a malicious man, as 1 Samuel 22. 9.
Doeg, be mischievous: if an host of 2 Kings 6. 15
flesh and blood be terrible; how much more these enemies which are not flesh
and blood?

No outward prowess can daunt them.
it is not outward prowess and courage, not strength of body, dint of sword,
troops of armed men, it is not state-policie, or warlike subtlety that can
annoy them, or keep us safe from them. To oppose wit or power of flesh and
blood against such as are not flesh and blood, is to set dry straw against
flaming fire. 2 Cor. 10. 4.
The weapons of our warfare must not be carnal, but spiritual, and so mighty
toward God, to keep us safe from these enemies. For seeing our enemies are
not flesh and blood, in vain is such armor as can protect us only from flesh
and blood.

. 10. The Devil has his hand in every temptation.
IN combats even with flesh and blood we have especially to do with Satan:
Doct. 5. Satan the principal in all conflicts.
Flesh and blood is but Satan's instrument, he is the General, he the Captain,
he sets flesh and blood on work, he assisteth flesh and blood, so as he is
the author and finisher of the evil which they do: they being but his vassals,
though they seek to annoy us; yet we wrestle not with them, but with an
higher power. Genesis 3. 1.
When the Serpent tempted Euah, she had to do with the Devil; and therefore
the John 8. 44.
Devil is said to be a murderer from the beginning. The Sabeans and Chaldeans
robbed Job, yet Job. 1. 12.
is the deed attributed to Satan. Though a maid and a man brought Peter to
deny his Master, yet therein Luke 22. 31.
Satan winowed him. Mat. 16. 23.
Christ says to Peter who tempted him, Go behind me Satan. The persecuting
Jews hindered Paul from coming to the Thessalonians, yet he says 1. These. 2.
18.
Satan hindered him. Reu. 2. 10.
Satan is said to cast some of the Smyrnians into prison, yet men-persecutors
did it. In this respect he is called 2 Cor. 4. 4.
the god of this world, John. 8. 44.
the father of murderers, Ephesians. 2. 2.
aspirit that works in the children of disobedience: and false Apostles are
called 2. Cor. 11. 15
ministers of Satan, That which is said of flesh and blood, in regard of others
soliciting us to sin, or hindering us from good, may be applied to our selves
in regard of our corruption and evil lusts, which provoke us to evil: Satan
has an hand in them; yea he is the author and finisher of the mischief which
they do, so as in those temptations which arise from our flesh, we have to do
with Satan. Therefore the Apostle dehorting us from anger says, Ephesians. 4. 27.
Give no place to the Devil. When covetousness moved Ananias to lie against
his conscience, Saint Peter said, Acts 5. 3.
Why has Satan filled thine heart? When pride moved David to number the
people, it is said 1 Chr. 21. 1.
Satan provoked him: for as the spirit of God stirs us up to every good
thing, so the spirit of the Devil suggesteth unto us every evil thing.

Aram. In all combats whether against our own corruptions, Fight principally
against the Devil.
or against evil men, as persecutors, seducers, and the like, strive to drive
the Devil away, and that by spiritual armor; 1 Kings 22. 31.
yea, pray to God to rebuke him. Assuredly flesh and blood cannot much annoy
us, if Satan be resisted and withstood. Observe in all histories of all ages,
the records of battles, and ye shall find that if the Generals and Captains
have been conquered, the common soldiers have soon yielded, or been put to
flight.

It is the Devil which blows up in us the fire of lust, pride,
covetousness, and all other vices: he lays before us evil baits, agreeable
to our nature, and so seduceth us: he inrageth persecutors, he blinds
idolaters, he seduceth heretics, etc. If this were well weighed it would make
us pity flesh and blood when it fights against us, rather then envy it: it
would keep us from snarling like a dog at the stone which is flong.

Romans 6. 23.
which is death: but hereof I shall have fit occasion to speak hereafter on
this word, worldly-gouernours.

. 11. Who cannot stand against flesh and blood, can much less stand against
principalities and powers.
THe affirmative part of the description of our assaulters follows, which is
joined to the other part with an aduersatiue particle but: (...).
not with flesh and blood, but with principalities: whereby is further
confirmed that which we have Doct 4.
before proved, and shall yet more evidently be demonstrated in handling the
particular branches of this description, Doct. 6.
that our enemies, with whom we are to wrestle, are much more terrible then
flesh and blood. I will not stand to prove the Doctrine again in this place,
only here observe one use.

Who are qualed by flesh and blood cannot stand against principallities.
He that is terrified with the barking of a little whelpe, will be much more
with the roaring of a Lion: he that in faith cannot say, Psalm. 118. 6.
I will not fear what man can do, can never say, I will not fear what
Principalities can do. Let this be noted of those who are turned out of the
ways of righteousness, and made to fly by man's threatenings, reprochings, and
evil intreatings, let them never look to overcome and reign with Christ. The
Sabeans, Chaldeans, and all that flesh and blood could do, prevailed not
against Job. Wherefore when flesh and blood makes any assault, let us thus
reason with ourselves, There are sorer enemies then these, with whom we must
wrestle: if we shrink from these, how shall we stand against them? Let the
consideration hereof make us the more bold and confident against all that flesh
and blood can do.

. 12. Exposition of words.
NOw consider we the particular branches of this description of our enemies.
There are four distinct branches distinguished by this particle against. (...).
Much ambiguitie and obscurity is in this description. I will therefore as
plainly as I can clear the meaning of the words.

From these several branches many collect diverse and distinct orders of
Devils, one subordinate to another: as among men there be diverse orders, some
Kings, some Dukes, Earls, Barons, etc. Thus they make the Devil, mentioned
Verse. 11.
before, the head and Monarch of all the rest: Principallities under him:
powers under them, and so in the rest. For my part, I think these distinctions
in this place ouer-curious: I deny not an order to be amongst Devils, even as
amongst thieves, pirates, connycatchers, etc. There is an head and Mat. 9. 34.
Prince of them. For mention is made of the Mat. 25. 41.
Devil and his angels. There may be also distinct and several offices among
them (as among the forenamed pirates) as some to tempt, some to accuse, some to
execute vengeance, etc. For if all should do the same thing, how should the
other things be done? but that certain be always tied to one place, person
and function, is both uncertain and unlikely. Further, that here in this
place there should be so many orders and ranckes of Devils, as are distinct
branches, is also uncertain; neither can any such thing by any just
consequence be collected.

I rather take these titles to be used by the Apostle, to set forth their
conditions and effects.

The first title is Principallities, or governments: so termed, because they
have great rule, power, and dominion, not so much over other Devils, as over
wicked men.

The second is powers, to show that their principallitie is not a mere titular
matter, but is armeed with power, so as with their powerful government, they
are able to do great matters.

These two titles, principallities and powers, are In abstracto.
thus set down, rather then In concreto.
powerful governors, to amplify both the one, and the other.

The third is worldly Governors. This I take to be added as an exposition of
the first, or rather as a limitation thereof, showing over whom the Devils are
governors: not over the chosen and called of God; but over the world (For John
17. 9. (...).
Christ makes a direct opposition betwixt these:) therefore the Apostle uses
a compound word, which expresses not only their government, but also their
subjects.

But the John 3. 16.
elect also are counted to be of the world while here they live, Object.
because in the world they were bred, brought forth, brought up, and ended
their days.

They are in the world, Answer.
but not of the world, Ioh. 17. 6, 16. (...).
after that they are effectually called: therefore for more perspi^uitie sake,
the Apostle adds this clause, of the darkness of this world, whereby
particularly he shows whom the Devils govern in this world; namely; such as
are darkness: here again for emphasis sake, he rather uses this word In
abstracto.
darkness then In concreto.
dark: and he understands the darkness of ignorance and wickedness: so
that in plain terms they are the ignorant and wicked men of the world, over
whom the Devils reign.

The fourth is spiritual wickedness. This declares their nature, that they
are spirits, and their condition, that they are evil, and malicious. The
phrase which the Apostle uses is somewhat strange, word for word it is this,
(...).
Spirituals of wickedness, or spirits of wickedness, that is, most monstrous
wicked spirits.

Lastly, is added a phrase somewhat ambiguous, because that whereunto it has
reference, is not expressed: it is this, word for word, (...).
in heauenlies. Here some to make up the sense add places, whereby is implied
that these evil spirits are over us in the air: for there are three places in
Scripture termed Heaven. Mat. 6. 26.
First the air where fowls are. Genesis 22. 17.
Secondly, the firmament where the ^tarres are. Thirdly, that place of glory,
which is called Gods Throne, Matthew. 6. 9.
where Christ in his body, and the souls of the just and perfect men departed
are. This is called the third Heaven, 2. Cor. 12. 2.
the highest Heaven.

Now if the place of spirits be here meant, by heavenly places must needs be
meant the air, which is the lowest heaven: for Reu. 12. 8, 9, 10, and 21. 27.
out of the highest heaven they are excluded. Other add things, whereby is
implied the cause of this combat, which is not any light, fading earthly
trash, but heavenly and spiritual treasure. Of the difference of these
expositions, I shall speak more fully, when I come more distinctly to handle
this clause.

Of these four forenamed branches; two, namely the first and the third do in
the general scope set forth one and the same point; namely the dominion of
the Devils* the fourth contains three distinct points. First, the nature of
Devils. Secondly, their quality. Thirdly, the place, or cause of the combat.

Our enemies then are in this affirmative part described by five arguments; 1.
Their government: 2 Their power: 3. Their nature: 4. Their quality: 5. Their
place of abode, or cause of fight.

. 13. Of Satan's dominion.
FOr the first, this word principallit^es, being meant of Devils, shows that

Our spiritual enemies have a dominion, Doct. 7.
a rule, a government: The Devils have a dominion.
For this title Titus 3. 1.
principallities, is given to men that are in authority, and in this very
respect, because they have rule and government. As for the Devils, they are
expressly called governors in this verse, and in other places, the Devil is
called Chap 2. v. 2.
a prince, 2. Co^. 4. 4.
a god.

Quest. How came the Devils to have a regiment? is their government from God?
ordained of him?

Answ. I may to this question in some sort apply the answer which Christ gave
to Pilat, John 19. 11.
they could have no power at all, Reason 1.
except it were given them from above. So that their dominion is by Gods
permission, Gods permission.
who in just judgment for 2 These. 2. 11.
punishment of the wicked, has given liberty to the Devil to exercise
jurisdiction over them. For as Deuteronomy. 28 48.
God gave the rebellious Israelites into the power of cruel tyrants and
usurpers, Judges 3. 8.
so he gives the world into the power of the Devil.

Yet have they no true right and title to their government, as if it were
properly deputed unto them of God, as the government of lawful Kings and
Magistrates on earth is. For as the Kings of foreign Nations which invaded
Israel, and for a while ruled over them, were but oppressors and usurpers,
(though Esaias 10. 5.
God in justice made them a rod to punish the people) and therefore Judges 3. 9.
when Israel repented, the Lord delivered them, and cast the rod into the
fire: so the Devils. Other reasons therefore there be of the Devils dominion,
and that partly in regard of themselves, and partly in regard of their vassals.

For themselves they have usurped dominion, Reason 2. Satan's usurpation.
they have by tyranny taken principallitie unto themselves, even as one of
their chiefest instruments on earth have done (I mean that man of sin, 2
These. 2. 4.
Who exalts himself above all that is called god, or worshipped, showing
himself that he is God, even that Whore of Babylon, who Reu. 18. 7.
glorified her self.) Thus have these Principallities here spoken of, exalted
and glorified themselves. In regard of this ambitious tyrannical usurpation;
the Devil having showed Christ all the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory
of them, said Luke 4. 6.
This is delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will, I give it.

For the Devils vassals (which are all the wicked of the world) they slauishly
and willingly yield themselves to his government and tyranny, Reason 2.
making themselves subject to these principallities, Man's subjection.
whereby the rather these Devils have taken dominion over them: Judges 9. 6.
as the men of Shechem subiecting themselves to Abimelech, he became their
King: 2 Samuel 15. 13
as the hearts of Israel turned after Absalom, and he became their King: and 1
King. 12. 20.
after that to Jeroboam, and he became their King; and to many others who
became their Kings: in which respect God said, Hos. 8. 4.
They have set up a King, but not by me; they have made Princes, and I knew it
not. That the wicked do willingly and slauishly subject themselves to the
Devil is without question: for it is written Reu. 13. 4.
The whole world worshipped the Dragon which is the Devil.

Ephesians. 4. 27.
how we give any place to the Devil, or yield unto him any whit at all. Where
he gets any entrance, Give no place to the Devil.
there will he set his throne, as Ier. 43. 10.
Nebuchadnezzar did; he is exceeding ambitious, and tyrannical: he will be a
King, or no body: if he get an inch, he will take an ell: if any make
themselves in any thing subject unto him, he will soon take a principallitie
over them. Now consider in how woeful an estate they live, who have earthly I
yrants to rule over them, and withal consider how far the Devil exceeds all
the Tyrants of this world in malice and mischief, and from thence gather in
what misery they lie, who are under the principallity of Satan.

His service is to rule.
at their command, which is the conceit of Witches, Coniurers, Sorcerers and
the like, yea also of many profane and wicked worldlings. Indeed he may, and
does often pretend and make show of service, but it is like the service of him
who styles himself, Dominus Papa* servus seruorum.
A servant of servants: only a means the more to insinuate himself into
them, and to get the more sovereign principallitie and rule over them. They
know not the Devil nor themselves, who think to rule over him.

Subject thy self to Christ
One King cannot brook that another should have principallitie over his
subjects. If Christ be our Lord and King, he will not suffer other Lords,
especially such as are his enemies, to rule and reign over us. But otherwise,
if we be like those who said, Luke 19. 14.
We will not have this man to reign over us: Psalm. 2. 3.
Let us break his bands, and cast his cords from us; then in just judgment
will Christ give us over to the tyranny of Satan For there is no middle
monarchy or regiment betwixt these: whosoever are not Christ's subjects, are
Satan's vassals. Revel. 13. 8.
All that dwell on the earth shall worship the Devil, whose names are not
written in the book of life. Note what was threatened against Israel, Deuteronomy.
28. 47. 48, etc.
Because thou seruedst not the Lord thy God, etc. Therefore thou shall serve
thine enemies, etc. This will be just with the Lord to give them over to
Satan's power, who rebel against him; that so by their hard bondage under him,
they might the better see their folly, and if they have so much grace, bewail
it, and become wiser.

. 14. Of Satan's power.
THe second argument whereby the Devils are described, is their power: this
shows, that

As our spiritual enemies have a dominion, Doct. 8.
so they have power to exercise the same: Devils able to exercile their
domino^. (...).
a power whereby they are able to keep their vassals and captives under them
in subjection. In this respect Satan is called Chap 2 v. 2.
a Prince of power. Many titles in Scripture given unto him do argue as much,
as Luke 11. 21.
strong man armed, 1 Pet. 5. 8.
roaring Lion, Reu. 12. 3.
great red Dragon, 2 Cor. 4. 4.
god of this world. Consider how he dealt with Job, and it will appear that
he is indeed a Prince of power.

The Lord suffers him to be a Prince of such power, Reasons.


1 That his own divine power might be the more manifested, in subduing such a
powerful Prince.

2 That there might be made a greater trial of the courage of his Saints and
children. Thus was Jobs courage and strength manifested.

3 That he might execute the sorer vengeance upon the wicked.

This general point, that the Devil is a powerful and mighty Prince, being
thus cleared, for the better understanding of Satan's power; I will as plainly
as I can resolve their particular questions.

1 Whether the Devils be able to do what they will?

2 If not what they will, then whether they be able to do any thing above the
course of nature?

3 If not above nature, wherein consists their extraordinary power?

4 Whether their power be any whit lessened since their fall?

5 Whether they have always liberty to do what they are able?

. 15. Of the restraint of Satan's power.
1 FOr the first, The Devil cannot do what he will.
The Devil is not able to do whatsoever he will; for this is proper only to
God, whose power is infinite. Were he able to do what he would, God should
have no command of him, no power over him: but he himself is a creature, his
power is a created power: and therefore limited within the bounds of a creature.

2 For the second, Nor do any thing against nature.
He is not able to do any thing simply above, or directly against that course
which the Lord has ordained unto his creatures, which is commonly called, the
course of nature. For God has tied all his creatures thereunto; and has
reserved only unto himself, who is the sole Lord of nature, power to alter it
as pleases him. Which being so, by necessary consequence, it follows that
the Devil, 1. Cannot work miracles, 2. Nor force the will of man, 3. Nor know
the secrets of man's heart, 4. Nor foretell things to come: for all these are
either above, or against the course of nature.

. 16. Of Satan's power in miracles.
1 COncerning miracles, Nor work miracles.
the Devil cannot work any. For Christ by the miracles which he wrought,
manifested himself to be the Son of God, endued with divine power. The
Prophets and Apostles were declared to be the servants God, and assisted with
divine power; yea God was manifested to work in and by them, by the miracles
which they wrought. If the Devil had power to work miracles, miracles had not
been so evident a demonstration of the power of God. The very Sorcerers could
say of the miracles which were wrought by the ministry of Moses, Exodus 8. 19.
This is the finger of God.

Object. Those Sorcer^rs wrought some of the miracles which Moses did.

Ans. The works done by the Sorcerers in Egypt were counterfeit.
Though there were some outward likeness and resemblance betwixt some of those
things which Moses and the Sorcerers did, as turning rods into Serpents, water
into blood, and bringing abundance of frogs; yet in truth there was a very
great and maine difference betwixt them. There is no doubt but the things which
Moses did, were truly and properly miracles: as for the things which the
Sorcerers did, either they might be done by natural means, as the Devil
might secretly conueigh Serpents, and blood, and frogs from other places to
Egypt: or else the things which they did might be mere illusions, only
appearances of things which were not so: and so the Egyptians made to think
they saw Serpents, blood, and frogs, when in truth there were no such things:
this latter is the more likely, as may be gathered by the circumstances noted
in those histories. First for the Serpents, it is said that Exodus 7. 12.
Aarons rod devoured their rods: Evident therefore it is, that Aarons rod was
turned into a true living Serpent, and likely that the Sorcerers rods were
not so, because they made no resistance, but were devoured.

2 For the waters, it is noted, that Exodus 7. 20. 24. 25.
all the water that was in their river was turned into blood, and so continued
seven days, and that they could not drink of that water. But no such thing
written of the waters which the Sorcerers seemed to turn into blood; neither
is it likely these waters were so: for the waters which they seemed to turn
must needs be in Goshen, (which was free from all the plagues) in Egypt all was
blood.

3 For the frogs, those which Moses brought Exodus 8. 14.
were gathered on heaps, and made the Land stink. But what became of those
which the Sorcerers brought?

Objection. Why then went they no further? could they not as easily have made
show of lice?

Answer. God would not suffer them any longer to delude the Egyptians.

Fitly may I apply that 2 These. 2. 9.
title which the holy Ghost attributes to the pretended miracles of
Antichrist, unto all the pretended miracles of Satan, and call them lying
wonders.

. 17. Of Satan's power over Man's will.
2. COncerning Man's will, Nor force man's will* Diabolus ad malum cogere non
potest. Cries. in Mat 4. ho^. 5
the Devil cannot simply and directly force it to yield to any thing: for this
is against that nature which God has given to the will. Take away freedom
from the will, and ye clean destroy the will it self. Therefore God in
converting a sinner forces not his will, but works in him to Phil. 2. 13.
(...).
will.

Object. Satan brings the will of natural Men to his bent.

Answ. This he does partly by fair allurements, and partly by fearful
terrors; by some external means or other, he moves the will to yield unto
him. All at all times yield not unto him. If he could force the will, he
would draw all to his bent.

. 18. Of Satan's power over Man's heart.
3. COncerning Man's heart, Nor search man's heart.
it is as a bottomless pit, of an unsearchable depth, Ier. 17. 9.
deceitful above all things: to search it, and simply to know the secret is
above the reach of nature: Ier. 17. 10.
it is one of Gods incommunicable properties to be a searcher of the heart.
Acts 1. 24.
Hereby John 1 47, 48, 49.
N^thanael gathered that Christ was the Son of God.

Object. Most of the Devils temptations be framed according to the inward
disposition and secret intents of men's hearts.

Answ. Though certainly he know them not, Diabolus non rimatur cordis occulta,
sed ex corporis habitu and gestibus aestimat quid versemus intrinsecus. Hieron.
in Mat. 15.
yet very shrewdly can be guess at them, and that not only by their outward
speech, behavior and carriage, (which he espieth more narrowly then all the
men in the world can) but also by the inward humors, temperature and
disposition of the body, which (being a spirit) he discemeth as easily as the
outward behavior.

. 19. Of Satan's power in foretelling things to come.
4. COncerning things to come, Nor foretell things to come.
a simple foretelling of them, without any help at all from natural causes,
signs, effects, and the like, is also above nature: God Isai. ^1. 23. and 48.
5.
proves himself to be the true Jehovah hereby. Ier. 28. 9.
Hereby he gave testimony to his Prophets to be sent of him, and guided by his
Spirit. Satan cannot do this.

Object. Satan and his instruments have foretold many things to come, 1 Samuel
28. 19
as when he appeared to Saul; and Acts 16. 16.
the divining Maid; yea Deuteronomy. 13. 1, 2
God implies that they may.

Answ. Such things they may foretell, as by natural causes or signs may be
collected, or coniectured: or which by God have any way been revealed. The
Devil is admirably and extraordinarily skillful, and experienced in all the
causes of nature, and can draw one consequence upon another: Simil.
As if one linck of a long chain being in a deep well, appear but a little
above water, by it he can draw up linck after linck, and so at length the
bucket it self out of the water, which otherwise could not have bin seen.
Also he diligently marketh all the secrets which God reuealeth, even so soon
as they are revealed, and so may seem to foretell of himself inch things as
God foretold. There was very great probability of that which the Devil told
to Saul: the things which the divining Maid and such other foretold, might be
such as were gathered by some unknown natural causes. That which God implies
of false Prophets, may be meant of mere conjectures, or of some such instances
as are here named.

. 20. Of the extent of Satan's power.
3 FOr the third, Wherein Satan's extraordinary power consists.
the extraordinary power of the Devil consists in this, that he can do any
thing whatsoever is in the compass of nature, and may be effected by natural
means. For example, Job 1. 16. 19.
he can violently move the air, and cause tempests and storms: Ibid.
he can inflame the air, and cause thunder and lightning; yea, and
extraordinary fire to fall down: he can exceedingly trouble the Seas, and
cause such waves and billows to arise, as shall swallow up ships and men: he
can cause waters to swell over the bancks, and so make great breaches. On earth
he can cause earthquakes, he can throw down the strongest buildings, and
root up the best settled trees, and move all things: he can carry and hurry
up and down even in the air Mat 4. 5. 8.
the bodies of men and beasts: yea, Mat. 8. 32.
he can enter into them, and make them with violence rush and run headlong
hither and thither: Mat. 17. 15.
he can cast them into the fire and water, Mat. 15. 22
grievously vex and torment them, and Job 2. 7.
inflict sore diseases upon them; he can Mark 9. 17, etc.
possess them, make them lunatic, dumb, deaf, blind; make them foame and
roar out, and all to rent them; he can stir up Ephesians. 4. 27.
wrath, pride, covetousness, lust, and the like passions in men; he can know
the disposition of men, and accordingly lay baits for them, or bring them unto
baits; he can 2. Cor. 4. 4.
darken men's understanding, and Mat. 27. 3, etc.
cause much trouble and anguish in their soul and conscience; yea, so much as
they cannot endure it, but are brought to make away themselves; he can incense
man against man, Kingdom against Kingdom, Subjects against Princes, Princes
against subjects, and so cause quarrels, wars, treasons rebellions,
oppressions, murders, etc. Many more strange mischiefs can he work, which
for kind are extraordinarily wonderful, and for number innumerable.

. 21. Of the power of evil Angels compared to good.
4 FOr the fourth, Whether Satan's power be diminished by his fall.
if comparison be made betwixt the Devils and the good Angels, (to whom at
their first creation they were equal in power) it is evident that their power
is somewhat lessened by their fall. For Reu. ^2. 7.
whenever there was any opposition betwixt good and evil Angels, the evil
were always foiled, they could not stand against the good. But in comparison
to other creatures, they still retain so much power over them, as their power
cannot appear to be any whit diminished by their fall: but that still they
remain to be as powerful to do mischief, as they were before to do good:
for all other creatures (except the good Angels) are not able to withstand
their might and fury.

. 22. Of the restraint of Satan's power.
5. FOr the fifth, Satan cannot as he lift do what he is able.
though the word here attributed to the Devils do properly signify (...).
a liberty to do as one list, yet it may not, nor cannot be denied, that that
power which is given them is so limited and restrained by an higher and
superior power, even the power of God, that they cannot as they list
themselves exercise the uttermost of their power, and do what they are able to
do, if they were not held in. Fitly may I apply that to the Devil, which is
said of the Sea, Job. 38. 10, 11.
that God has set bars and doors before him, and said, Hither to shall he
come, and no further. In this respect they are said 2. Pet. 2. 4.
to be delivered into chains, and Jude verse. 6.
reserved in everlasting chains: By which phrases is implied that the Lord
deals with Devils, Simil.
as men use to do with cursed mad ban-dogges, which will fly at the throat
of every one with whom they meet, they tie and chain them up for fear of
doing hurt. For proof hereof, note what God said to the Devil under the
Serpent, e Thou shall bruise his heel: by which phrase is implied a restraint,
namely, that he should not come so high as the Saints head to crush it, he
should only snarle at his heel, and bite it; that is, he should not be able
utterly to destroy their souls, but only annoy them with smaller temptations.

But more clearly is this laid down by many particular instances. Exodus 8. 18.
Satan's power in the Sorcerers of Egypt was restrained; the 1. Sam. 16. 14
evil spirit could not enter into Saul, till God permitted him: for it is
said, God sent him. 1 Kings* 22. 22.
The like is noted of the lying spirit that seduced Ahab. Zach. 3. 1, 2.
Satan stood at Iehoshuahs right hand to resist him, but the Lord reproved him.
Luke 22. 31, 32.
He desired to wi^ow Peter, and the other Apostles, (so as without leave he
could not do it) and yet he prevailed not as he desired. Many other particular
instances might be alleged; but the most famous of all is that which is noted
in the history of Job, Job 1. 11, 12 and 2. 5, 6.
where he could do nothing against Job till he had leave, and when he had
leave, he could do no more then was permitted. Lastly, as an argument from the
less to the greater, and so a more forceable argument, note Mat. 8. 31.
how he could not enter into swine without permission; much less can be do
any thing against man without leave. Mat. 6. 26.
Are not men much better then swine?

Object. But now Reu. 20. 7.
Satan is loosed, and has liberty to do what he can.

Answ. That is spoken comparatively, in regard of former restraint: Simil.
as when a dog has sometime been tied very close, and afterward his chain
is let out further, he may be said to be loosed.

The Lord thus limiteth his power, Reasons. Why God restrains Satan's power.
both in regard of himself, and also in regard of man, who is made after Gods
Image.

For himself: 1. That he might manifest a difference betwixt his own power,
which is infinite, without limits and bounds; and the power of his enemies who
oppose themselves against him. Therefore is his power called Verse 10.
a power of might, as if no other power were mighty but his. 2. That he might
show himself to be an absolute Lord and Commander over all creatures, not
only those who voluntarily subject themselves to him, but also those Mark 1. 27
who obstinately oppose against him.

For man, left the Devil should soon devour all mankind, for that he 1.
Pet. 5. 8.
seeks. If he were not restrained, no creature could resist him, and stand
before him. As the Sea, Simil.
if it had not bounds, would soon ouerwhelme the whole world, so would the
Devil soon turn all topsie turuie, quickly destroy all living creatures,
and bring all to the very depth of hell, where himself is. Therefore though
the Lord for just reasons has given him a very great and mighty power, yet in
wisdom and goodness has he also restrained his power, and set bounds unto
it:

Thus we have heard of the extent, and of the restraint of the Devils power,
both which are well to be noted.

The one, Uses.
that we should not make too light account of him. Make not a tush at Satan.
The other, that we should not dread him too much.

Is the Devil a Prince of such power? Be neither arrogant nor secure; but
know that all the means which we can use, are little enough to keep us safe
from him. Yea, ^ Chi. 20. 12.
let us seek for greater power and strength then is in our selves, Postquam
dixit fortem, postea estendit ligat^^ vt si te audita fortitudo terruerit,
ligari^ eius nunciata consortet. Chrysostom, in Mat.
remembering the exhortation in the tenth verse, and the direction in the
eluenth.

Yet because he is neither able to do what he will, nor has liberty
always to do what he is able, but has his power restained and limited by
God, be not fainthearted, nor despair. Though he may s^rely assail us, yet
assuredly shall he never prevail against us: remember Jobs conflict, 12. Hom.
29.
and Iam. 5. 11.
the end thereof. As we cast one eye on the extent of the Devils power, to
keep us from security: so cast another on the restraint thereof, to keep us
from despair.

. 23. Of the place where Satan rules.
THe next point shows yet a further restraint of the Devils power. For it
declares the parties over whom especially he exercises his power: who are
first implied under this compound word (...).
worldly governors, and then more expressly handled in the next ensuing words.

From the general I collect that, Doct. 9. Satan's rule only in this world.
The government of Devils is only in this world, and over the men thereof. It
can no further extend then to the compass of this inferior world under
heaven; neither can it longer last then the time of this world. Thus the Chap.
2. v. 2.
devils dominion is restrained to the air, and expressly is he termed the 2.
Cor. 4. 4.
god of this world. 1. Cor. 15. 24.
At the end of this world shall Christ put down his authority and power.

It has pleased the Lord to appoint this world, Reason*
and the continuance thereof, the place and time of probation, wherein he will
make trial who are fit for his Kingdom, who unworthy of it^ and for the more
thorough trial of good and bad, to give Satan dominion and power in this world.

the devils have nothing to do: Reu 12. 8. etc.
they are thence cast out. As Christ (who in this world was sorely assaulted by
Satan) Ephesians. 4. 8.
when he ascended up on high, led captiuitiecaptiue, and triumphed over them:
so 2 Tom. 2. 11.
If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. Death, whereby a passage is made
from this war-faring world, to that world of triumph, is the last enemy; the
pangs thereof the last assaults; so as this being well thought of, cannot but
move us with patience to Heb. 12. 4.
resist unto blood and death.

. 24. Of the parties over whom Satan rules.
YEt more distinctly are the parties over whom Satan rules, expressed in these
words, Darkness of this world, whereby are meant such ignorant and wicked men
as have no light of spiritual understanding, no life of grace in them, and
therefore deservedly called darkness.

The Di^els rule and dominion is properly, Doct.
and principally over ignorant and evil men: 10. Ignorant and evil men Satan's
vassals.
even such as are described, Chap. 4. verse. 18. 19. and before that called
Chap. 2. v. 2.
children of disobedience, or of unbelief, for the (...)
original word will bear both. For ignorant men, the Devil is said to be the
2 Cor. 4. 4.
god of them that are blinded. For wicked, 1. Ioh 3. 8.
they which commit sin, are said to be of the Devil.

These resist him not, Reason 1.
but yield unto him: for ignorant persons know not his power, These resist not.
malice, subtlety, sedulitie, mischievous enterprises, with the like: no
marvel therefore that they suffer themselves to be guided and governed by
Satan. 2. Kings 6. 19. etc.
When the men of Ara^^ were stricken with blindness, they were easily without
any resistance, led into the midst of the chiefest and strongest City of
their enemies, Simil.
for they saw not whither they went. So ignorant men not seeing in whose power
they are, suffer themselves there to be.

Wicked persons believe not that the Devil is so cruel a tyrant as he is
reported to be: They think him to be the best Lord, because he suffers them
to do as they list, and his temptations are agreeable to their corrupt humors
and carnal desires: they take most delight in doing the work of the Devil;
yea, as Christ John 8. 44.
says, they will do the lusts of their father the Devil. Virtus Diaboli est
quod homnes mali sunt. Chrysostom. in Mat. 22. hom. 42.
Is it then any marvel that the Devil is their governor?

Neither ignorant nor wicked persons will subject themselves to the Lords
government: Reason 2. They are not subject to Christ.
not ignorant, because they know not the benefit of it: not wicked, because
they think it too strait, too much crossing their licentious humor. Therefore
in justice God gives them over to the rule of the Devil.

Hereby may trial be made whether we be under the rule and power of the
Devil or no. Use 1. Trial if under Satan's power or no.
John 3. 19.
If we love darkness more then light, if we Chap. 5 v. 11.
have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, we are in the
power of the Prince of darkness. Hearken to this O ignorant persons, ye that
are neglecters and despisers of the light of Gods Word, that cry out against so
much preaching: if at least your ears be better then your eyes, and you can
believe that which by others is declared unto you. Hearken to this also, O ye
wicked persons, who pursue so eagerly the evil desires of your hearts, and the
foolish customs of the vain World* if at least your evil hearts will let you
yield to any thing that may turn to your good. Oh, if it were possible, for
these two sorts of persons, to see in what a miserable plight they are by those
governors under whom they live, then would the ignorant learn knowledge, and
sinners enter into a new course. Fondly they think they live in great liberty,
whereas in truth, they live in most slavish bondage. I may justly in this case
take up the complaint of Wisdom, and say, Prou 1. 22.
O ye foolish, how long will ye love foolishness, etc.

Acts 26. 18.
by coming out of darkness into light. How a man may come out of Satan's power.
So long as we live and lie in darkness, there is no hope, no possibility of
freeing our selves from the tyranny of Satan. Col. 1. 13.
God first delivers us from the power of darkness, and then translateth us
into the Kingdom of his Son.

This use affoordeth a good direction to Magistrates, to Ministers, to all that
have charge of others, and to private persons.

To Magistrates, that they take order to establish the Ministry of the Word
in such places as are under their rule.

To Ministers, that they be diligent and faithful in preaching it.

To all that have charge, that they bring such as are under them to the Word.

To private persons, that they be willing to hear, and careful to practice
what they hear.

Note what Christ says of the issue and power of the Word preached by his
Disciples, Luke 10. 18.
He saw Satan fall down like lightning: for by it men's minds are enlightened,
and their hearts converted, so as Satan cannot bear such sway over them, as
he does over ignorant and wicked persons*

That which is in general said of freeing men from the tyranny of Satan, may
particularly be applied to those who are in bondage under his great Viceroy
on earth, How Papists may be abandoned.
even Antichrist, which deceives the greatest part of the world. His kingdom
is a kingdom of darkness: where the light of the Gospel shines forth, the
clouds and mistes of that darkness vanish away. Experience shows, that
where the preaching of the Word is rare, there is greatest number of
Antichrists vassals. God grant this may be duly considered by them, who for
the safety of the Kingdom, and the furtherance of Religion, do treat of
means whereby the number of Papists may be diminished.

For our selves, let us first labor for the light of knowledge to inlighten
us, and then for the light of grace to renew us; so shall we be freed from the
kingdom of darkness. For the attaining hereunto, we must diligently attend
to the light of Gods word, and also pray for the Chap. 1. v. 17.
spirit of revelation and sanctification.

They who have sure evidence that they are Chap. 5. v. 8.
light in the Lord, Use 3. Comfort to such as are light.
may from hence reap comfort, in that thereby they may be assured, that though
they live in the world, yet they are not under the rule of the god of this
world: he is Prince only of the darkness of this world. Live therefore as
children of light, as the Lords freemen: have no fellowship with unfruitful
works of darkness. For 2. Cor. 6. 14.
what communion has light with darkness?

. 25. Of the nature of Devils.
THe third argument whereby the Devils are described, is their nature: they are
here termed (...).
spiritual things, so that

The enemies of our souls are of a spiritual substance. Doct. 11. Our enemies
are spirits.
Often in Scripture are they expressly called spirits, and that both in the old
and new Testament.

They were created spirits, and spirits they still remain to be. Their fall
has not altered their substance: for then could not that nature and substance
which transgressed be punished.

Devils are not qualities.
and teach that they be nothing but bad qualities and evil affections, which
arise from our flesh. The Apostle expressly denies them to be flesh, and
implies that they are much more then flesh: how then should they be thought to
be affections arising from the flesh? If because they are spiritual things
they should be no substances, but only qualities, then neither should the
Eccles. 12. 7.
souls of men, Heb. 5. 14.
nor good Angels, nor John 4. 14.
God himself be a substance: for all these in Scripture are termed Spirits.
But spiritual things may be as truly and properly substances as bodily things,
if not more: it is not any outward property of a body that simply makes a
substance: Things may be sensible, and yet be no substances, as colors,
sounds, smells, etc. But for the Devils, the actions which they perform, the
places where they abide, and from whence they go up and down, the power
wherewith they are endued, the torments and pains which they endure, with many
other like arguments, which out of the Scripture may be collected concerning
them, evidently show that they are truly and properly substances. The contrary
opinion, as it is erroneous, so it is very dangerous, in that it does much
extenuate those fearful things which have been delivered concerning Devils,
yea, it makes them to be but fables. Therefore this error is so much the
rather to be taken heed of.

. 26 Of the advantage which Satan has.
THe spiritual nature of Devils does many ways aggrauate their terror. Use 2.
Spirits very terrible.
For they being spirits, Spirits very terrible.
it follows that they are

1 Invisible: though they see us in every place, and on every side within and
without, yet they cannot be seen of us. And as their nature is, so are their
assaults, such as by the eyes of flesh and blood cannot be seen. Consider what
advantage one that sees has against a blind man. Genesis 19. 9. 11
The Sodomites who so fiercely assaulted Lots house, being stricken with
blindness could do no hurt. 2 Kin. 6. 19.
Elisha himself alone led an Army of his enemies (being made blind) whither
he list. We to spirits are as blind men: we can neither see them, nor their
assaults. I speak of men as they are flesh and blood, natural men. God gives
to them that are borne of the Spirit, spiritual eyes to discern them and
avoid them.

2 Privy to whatsoever we do or speak, whether we be in company or alone,
in light or in darkness: scarce a thought can pass from us, but they can
shrewdly guess at it: soon can they epsy out all our devices against them. 2
Kin. 6. 11.
The King of Aram found it to be a great disadvantage, that his enemy had one
who could disclose the words that he spoke in his privy chamber; and his heart
was troubled for this thing. What great advantage have these spiritual enemies
against us, who are flesh and blood?

3 Not hindered by any bodily impediments: no sensible substance can any whit
stay their course, or slacken their enterprise; they can either pass thorough,
or pass over all such things as would stop and hinder us; as armies of men,
stone walls, iron gates, woods, waters, yea, Seas, and Oceans, with the like.
They need not such space of time to pass from place to place, as we do; but
can on the sudden be in diverse places, which are many millions of miles
asunder. For they have no corporal gravity to hinder them, neither can they be
let by any bodily obstacle. The Sun is not swifter then they: the sight of a
man's eye, the lightning from Heaven is not more quick or speedy. Deuteronomy. 28. 49
This also is a very great advantage.

4 Not subject to any fainting, Diabolus qua^tum ad s nuquam cessaret tentans,
nec (...) habet alium actu^, non manducat, no bibit, no dormit, etc. propterea
infatigabilis e^t in malo. Chrysostom. in Mat. 4. hom 5.
to wearisomnesse, to failing or decaying, and the like, as bodies are: for
they are simple substances, not framed of any external matter, or contrary
qualities, which cause fainting, decaying, etc. Hence it is, that after they
have done many thousand great exploits, they are as fresh and ready to do many
more, as they were at first. They need no resting time, but continually night
and day are assaulting men without intermission, and without ceasing: some
comfort it is to them who are sorely assaulted by bodily enemies, that the
night comes on, 2 Samuel 2. 14. etc.
which usually causes some stay. But in the combat with spiritual enemies,
there is no hope of any such matter. No, they are not subject to death: Genesis 3.
15.
from the beginning of the World they have assaulted man; and to the end of the
World shall they continue: whereby they must needs gather much experience,
which is a great disadvantage.

I might further proceed in setting down other particular points of advantage
which they have against us, in this respect that they are spiritual things.
But these may suffice, and surely these may be enough to discourage many, and
make them say;

. 27. Of the help we have against Satan's advantages.
IF our enemies have such advantages, to what purpose do we resist and
maintain fight against them? Object.


Answ. Though they be spirits, yet God (in the power of whose might we are
strong) is a Spirit of spirits, the highest spirit, every way infinite. God is
invisible even to them, and they as blind as beetles to God: they cannot know
the counsel of God, yet God knows all their devices; God is every where
present, much less subject to decay then they. Yea, God gives to his
soldiers his Spirit to open their eyes, that they may see the Devils
temptations: he discovers all the purposes of the wicked one, and Luke 11.
22.
trusts him out of his hold: he keeps us from fainting: and for our further
encouragement Psalm. 91. 11.
gives his hosts of good Angels a charge to guard us, and keep us in all our
ways.



. 28. Of Satan's evil quality.
THe fourth argument whereby the Devils are described is their quality, which
is wickedness.

Some restrain this to their malice in particular. Their malice Verse 11.
has been in part laid forth by discovering their manifold wiles, and shall
further be declared on the last clause of this verse. Here I will speak of
their wickedness in general, for so I take the extent of this word in this
place.

The Devils are extremely evil: they are wholly and only set upon mischief
and wickedness: Doct. 12. Devils extremely evil.
Therefore as by a kind of exaggeration they are here called spirits of
wickedness, so elsewhere Satan is termed by a kind of propriety Mat. 13. 19.
that wicked one. Many attributes in Scripture are given to them, to set forth
their wickedness, as Mar. 1. 23.
unclean, Luke 8. 2.
evil, foul spirits, with the like.

In many respects may the Devil be accounted most monstrously wicked. Reasons.


1 Because he was the first author of wickedness: Ioh. 8. 44.
that which Christ says of one particular branch of wickedness, may be
applied to the general, he is the father of wickedness, and in that respect
is said to be a murderer from the beginning.

2 Because by nature he is most impure: no jot, no dram of goodness in him.
If that be true of a natural man, Genesis 6. 5.
That all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart are only evil
continually, much more is it true of the Devil.

3 Because he is most willing and forward unto evil, taking delight therein.
Not unfitly may I apply the words of the Psalmist to him, Psalm. 52. 3.
He loves evil more then good, and lies more then to speak truth. He is of
himself so set on mischief, that he needs none to egg him forward:
neither does it ever repent him of any evil that he does.

4 Because evil is his continual practice: what good he can he hinders,
and draws as many as he can to evil: all his temptations are to wickedness.
First he tempted man to sin, and ever since cease he not more and more to
stir him up thereunto, and that not only by himself, but also by his
instruments the flesh, the world, persecutors, idolaters, heretics, profane
men, etc.

Hereby may we take notice of the Devils meddling with us, when he prevails
against us: How to know when the Devil has to do with us.
Whenever we are solicited to any wickedness, then is the Devil at our
elbow; when we commit any wickedness, then has the Devil beguiled us, and
prevailed against us. As by our disposition to righteousness, and the fruits
of holiness, we may know the powerful work of the Spirit on us, so we may
know the rule of Satan in us by the works of wickedness. Ioh. 8. 44.
Christ proves that the Jews were of their father the Devil, because they
did the lusts of their father the Devil. For 1 Ioh. 3. 8.
he that commits sin is of the Devil, Chap. 2. v. 2.
who works in the children of disobedience.

This also may serve as a strong motive to dissuade us from all wickedness,
Use 2. Wickedness a diabolical quality.
because it is a diabolical quality: therein we are like not only to filthy
swine, but even to the infernal spirits. By committing wickedness we make our
selves the Devils instruments, yea, his imps and lims, and we bear his Image.
If it be a good motive (as needs it must be a good motive, for often it is urged
by the holy Ghost) to stir us up to holiness and righteousness, Leu. 19. 2.
because the Lord God is holy, Cha. 4 v. 24.
because that is his Image, 1 Pet. 1. 14.
that beseems his children; then by the consequence of contraries, it is also
a g^od motive to keep us from wickedness, because the Devil is a most wicked
spirit.

Note this all profane men, all impious despisers of God and of his holy
Ordinances, all cursed swearers and blasphemers, all cruel, malicious,
rebellious, riotous, lascivious, beastly persons: in a word all wicked persons
note this; as here you carry the Devils image, so assuredly shall ye in hell
partake of his punishment and torment, if ye repent not.

They who will have nothing to do with these spirits of wickedness, must have
nothing to do with wickedness it self. Whosoever let wickedness reign in
them, let the Devil reign over them. Satan enters not into us but by
wickedness.

. 29 Of the number of Devils.
AS a general amplification of all the forenamed arguments, in this
description of our spiritual enemies, note how every branch is set down in the
plural number, Principallities, Powers, Worldly Governors, Spirits, whereby is
implied, that

The Devils are many. Doct. 13. Many Devils.
If the question be asked how many they be, I answer that it is a needless, a
curious, and doubtful question: there is no ground in Scripture for resolution
of it. If the holy Scripture decide not this question, what Book can decide
it? yea, what need is there that it should be decided? too curious and too
bold they hane been, who have gone about to divide them into nine orders,
opposite to their conceited nine orders of good Angels, and in every order to
place certain millions.

But to let pass these uncertainties, certain it is that there are a very
great number of hellish spirits: for Reu. 12, 7.
they made an Host to fight against Michael and his Angels: yea, we read that
there were not only seven Luke 8. 2. 30.
Devils, but an whole legion in one Man: now a legion is computed to contain
about Hesychi^s.
6666. If at once in one Man there were so many, how many were there in all the
World besides: for we may suppose that no man is free at any time, but has
Devils attending on him to solicit him to evil; so that it is evident, that
though their just number cannot be reckoned up, yet that there is a very great
number, yea (as the Apostle says of good Angels) Heb. 12. 22.
An innumerable company.

Quest. Seeing there be so many Devils, how is it that oftentimes there is
mention made but of Verse. 11.
one whom we are to resist, 1 Pet 5. 8.
and stand against? Iam. 4. 7.


Answer. This shows that they have an head amongst them; Omnes damones de
Satanae veneno malitiae virtutem accipiunt, and sunt vnum in eo. Chrysostom. in Mat.
12. hom. 29.
and that he and they concur in the same mind, and all aim at the same end:
their forces are so united and combined together, as if they were all but one
Devil. Besides, this word Devil is a collectiue word, which compriseth many
under it: as Turk, Spaniard, etc. Thus we say, all Christendom together
raised an army against the Turk: or England sent forth an army against the
Spaniard. Whether therefore we use these words Satan, Devil, etc. in the
singular number, or Principallities, Powers, etc. in the plural number, all is
one. Under one many are comprised, and by many an united power is meant.

The number of Devils makes them the more terrible
what is it to be slaves to an innumerable company of Principallities, who have
such power, are so malicious and mischievous, and are all spirits, and Devils?
One Devil is able to foil many armies of flesh and blood: what then is one
poor man consisting of flesh, to legions of Devils? who have no other hope but
in flesh and blood, have no hope of safety at all, but are in a most miserable
plight. This hellish Host (if it were seen) could not but be much more terrible
to such, then the Host of the Syrians was to him that cried out; 2 Kin. 6. 15.
Alas master, Comfort against the multitude of Devils.
how shall we do? But to us that fight under Christ's banner, there are two
strong props. One, that Ibid. v. 16.
they which are with us, are more then they which are with them. The other,
that 1. Sam. 14. 6.
there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few. 2. Chro. 14. 11.
1. More good Angels then evil.
That there are more with us then against us, is apparent: for all the good
Angels are with us, watch over us, and fight for us. Now it is out of doubt
that there are more good Angels then evil: for the Scripture speaks much
more of the number of those, then of these. As the Devil had an host of evil
Angels with him, so had Reu. 72. 7.
Michael an host of good Angels with him. Mention is made of one legion of
Devils in one man, but Mat. 26. 53.
Christ could have had more then 12. legions of good Angels to guard him (which
amount to about 80000.) Dan. 7. 10.
Daniel mentions a far greater number, as thousand thousands, yea, ten
thousand thousands: yea, yet further, to show that all the set numbers which
we can set, come short of their number, the Apostle terms them, Heb. 12. 22.
A company of innumerable Angels: surely then there are more with us then
against us: for the good Angels Heb. 1. 14.
are all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for their sakes, which
shall be heirs of salvation.

The consideration of this is sufficient to uphold us, 2. God able to save
against many.
notwithstanding the multitude of Devils. But the other prop for our faith is
much stronger and surer; which is Gods infinite power, whereby he is able to
save as well against many as few. For when we consider that thousand thousands
are as one to him, what need the number of millions astonish us, more then
one? So that although the Devils be many ways fearful to them that are out
of the guard of good Angels, and protection of God, yet not to be feared of
such as belong to Christ.

. 30 Of Satan's abode in the Air.
THe fifth and last argument whereby our enemies are described is in the last
clause of this verse, which of all the rest is most doubtful. Most
Interpreters so expound it, as if the place of the Devils were here set down,
The advantage of di^els in regard of their place.
namely, the Air, which is often called Heaven; which being so, hereby is
implied, that they have very great advantage against us, by reason of the place
where they are. For the Devils being in the Air,

1 They are above us, 1. They are above us.
over our heads, every where round about us, and so still ready to annoy us:
this among men is counted a very great advantage: a few men on a hill, or on
high walls and Towers are able to do much mischief to a great Army in a low
valley beneath them.

2 They can espy all things that we do: 2. They ouerlooke us.
so that in this respect we are to be the more circumspect over our selves,
and vigilant against them. They which have envious, malicious enemies, which
ouerlooke them, and so can see whatsoever they do, will be careful that they
do nothing whereby those espiers may take advantage to accuse them, or to
work any mischief against them.

3 They are in their own Kingdom: 3. They fight in their own Kingdom.
for the Devil is Chap. 2. v. 2.
a Prince that rules in the Air: Now amongst men, they which are in their
own Dominion, where they have all at command, where they may have still new
supply, have a great advantage. And they which war in their enemies
Dominions, had need be backed with a far greater power then their enemies
have: but we of our selves are far weaker, and less in power then our
spiritual enemies, and we fight with them in the air, which is their
Kingdom, where they have all at command: have they not then in this respect a
great advantage? have not we need to be backed with a far greater power?

These and such like observations may be drawn from this circumstance of the
place: which I have the rather noted because most do so interpret this clause.

. 31 Of the cause of Satan's quarrel.
But yet freely and ingenuously to make known my own judgment (with
submission to better judgments) I rather think that the Apostle here means
the cause or prize of this combat, for which it is maintained, as if it were
thus translated, In heavenly things. My reasons are these.

1 In the original, places are not expressed, but indefinitely the Apostle
says, (...).
In heauenlies. Now when an adjective is so set alone, most usually the
substantive understood, is thing or things.

2 In other places being thus indefinitely set down, it is taken for heavenly
things, and so translated, as Heb. 8. 5. (...).
They serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things.

3 This word, being often used in the new Testament, at least twenty several
times, is never used in any man's opinion (this place only excepted) of any
aeriall place, or thing, but of those things which are truly heavenly and
spiritual: (...).
the word it self according to the proper notation thereof, signifies the
upper heauenlies: so as most improperly it is taken for the lowest Heavens, the
air.

4 It is not a matter of so great weight and moment for spirits to be in high
places over us, for they can as much annoy us being beside us, within us,
beneath us, as above us: high places may be an help to men who are clogged
with flesh and blood, to spirits they can be small advantages.

5 The words being expounded of heavenly things, this last clause adds as
great weight to the description of our enemies as any of the former, as we
shall see when we handle the Doctrine.

6 Both ancient and later Divines, Chrysostom, Muscul. Perkins on Gal. 2. 11.
and those of good learning and judgment, have thus expounded this clause; so
as it is no new or private conceit of mine.

Objection. This very word is often indefinitely used, as here; and yet it
signifies Places, as Chap. 1. Verse. 3. 20. and 2. 6. etc.

Answer. Though it signify heavenly places, yet not such as are in the lowest
heaven the air, but the highest, which is not the place of Devils; thither
because the Devil cannot come, I expound it Heavenly things.

Object. 2. The phrase will not bear this exposition: for the preposition in,
is never put for the cause.

Answ. Illud in coelestib. est pro eo quod est pro coelestib. Cries.
One of the Greek Fathers, who was very skillful in the propriety of that
tongue, so expounds it. Besides, this particle is so used in other places of
the new Testament: twice in one verse, namely Mat. 10. 32. Whosoever shall
confess me, I will confess him, etc: word for word, in me, in him. c (...).
Here the preposition in signifies the cause, as if he had said; he that shall
make confession before men for my sake, I will make confession before my Father
for his sake. So again, Mat. 11. 6. Blessed is he whosoever shall not be
offended (...).
in me, that is, for my sake: and Mat. 26. 31. All ye shall be offended (...).
in me. The Kings Translators turn it, because of me. So in this my Text, this
last clause having reference to the principal verb, may be thus translated;
We wrestle because of heavenly things.

The Doctrine then which hence I gather is this:

The maine things for which the Devils fight against us are Doct. 14.
heavenly matters. Devils fight to strip us of heavenly matters.
Before I proceed further to prove, or apply this point, I will a little more
fully explain it.

1 By heavenly matters, I mean such as principally respect Gods glory (for God
being himself Heavenly, whatsoever tends to his Honor, is in that respect
Heavenly,) and then such as respect our souls salvation: for as the things
which concern the temporal good of our body are earthly, so the things which
concern the eternal good of our souls are Heavenly: for to Heaven they
aspire, and in Heaven shall they enjoy their happiness.

2 Where (I say) the Devils fight for heavenly matters, Non vt ipsi victoriam
adepti aliquod consequantur, sed vt nos priuent. Chrysostom.
matters, my meaning is, not that they desire to get them, but that they
endeavor to spoil us of them: so that in this combat the prize propounded to
us is heavenly; namely, whether we will serve our Heavenly Father, or the
hellish feene: whether we will let go, or fast hold that heavenly treasure
which Christ has purchased for us, all those heavenly things whereby God is
honored, and our souls are saved.

For proof that they be heavenly things which Satan especially aims at,
observe those several temptations recorded in the Scripture: I will give a
taste of some. Genesis 3. 1: etc.
What aimed he at in tempting Adam and Eve? was it not to deface Gods Image in
them, and to strip them of that happiness wherein God had created them? The
issue shows as much. What sought he in tempting Christ? Mat. 4. 3. 9.
was it not to make him doubt whether he were the Son of God or no? yea, and
utterly renounce God, and worship the Devil? Luke 22. 31. 32.
Was it not Peter's faith that he sought to winow? Does he not blind men's eyes,
2 Cor. 4. 4.
that the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the Image of God,
should not shine unto them? As for earthly things he makes not much account of
them, he can be well content to let men enjoy them, he casts them to men as
baits: we read how Mat. 4. 8, 9.
he offered to Christ all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,
if Christ would have worshipped him.

Object. Job 1.
He deprived Job of his temporal estate.

Answ. It was an higher matter which Satan aimed at, namely, to bring him to
deny God, and blaspheme him to his face; Job 1. 11.
as may be gathered by Satan's answer to God.

He would make all like to himself. Through his pride he is fallen from
Heaven, and utterly spoiled and deprived of all heavenly goodness and
happiness; wherefore he seeks also to deprive man of the like.

Behold here the malice of the Devil: Use. The Devils malice.
it is no good that he seeks for himself by this fierce and long conflict
which he maintains, but our woe and misery. 1 Pet. 5. 8.
He seeks whom to devour. Malice first moved him to assault man, and malice
still whets him on to continue his fight against mankind. Durst he ever have
ventred on Christ Jesus the Son of God, but that malice wholly possessed him?
Not unfitly therefore are many titles given unto him in Scripture to set forth
his malice, as Zac. 3. 1.
Satan, which signifies an adversary; (...). Reu. 12. 9. 10.
Devil, an accuser, Mat. 4. 3. and
Tempter, 13. 19.
Evil one, 25.
Enemy, Ioh. 8. 44.
Murderer, and Father of lies. If the reasons of all these names (which are
not hard to gather) be duly weighed, Use 2. We fight for no small matter.
they will show that he is even made of malice.

Among other motives to stir us up to arm our selves well, Vide quomodo
vires inimici nos excitant eo quod scimus de rebus magnis esse periculum.
Chrysostom.
and constantly to stand and fight against the Devil, this is none of the
least. It is no small matter that we fight for, but a matter of the greatest
weight and consequence that can be. Satan could say ( Job 2. 4.) All that a man
has will he give for his life: yet is life but a temporal and earthly matter.
If all for his life, what for his soul, and the salvation thereof, which is an
heavenly matter? so as there is no comparison betwixt them. Mat. 16. 26.
What then shall it profit a man, though he should win the whole World, if he
lose his own soul? or what shall a man give for recompense of his soul?
Simil.
When wise Captains see that a sore and fierce battle is to be fought,
which with the very rumor thereof may dishearten their soldiers, they use to
hearten and encourage them by bringing to their mind, and setting before them
the prize, or cause of their fight: some will say, Lo, ye fight for whole
Towns, and Cities, and Kingdoms: others, Ye fight not to get that which is
other men's, but to keep that which is your own; ye fight for your Country,
your lands and inheritances, your wives and children: others, It is not honor
and conquest, they are not goods and lands that ye fight for, but liberty and
life: stand to it therefore, if the day be lost, ye are either dead men, or
slaves.

Note how the Philistims encouraged one another, 1 Samuel 4. 9.
Be strong and play the men, O Philistims, that ye be not servants to the
Hebrews. Now all these are but earthly matters; but I may say to the Lords
soldiers, It is the Lord of Heaven whose battles ye fight, his honor is
engaged therein; it is your souls salvation, and heavenly happiness, which is
in hazard: your enemies seek to spoil you of the precious graces of Gods
sanctifying Spirit, and to deprive you of that rich and glorious inheritance,
which Christ by no less price then his own blood has purchased for you: if
ye yield to your enemies, all these ye lose, and become vassals unto your
mortal and malicious enemy the Devil, ye are even firebrarnds of Hell. Be
strong therefore, and of a valiant courage: fear not, but fight and stand it
out to the uttermost; so shall ye be more then conquerers.

The things which especially we ought to look unto, Use 3. Look especially to
th^se things which Satan most seeks to spoil thee of.
to be watchful over, and to labor to keep safe, are the forenamed heavenly
things: and that not only in regard of the excellency and worth of them, but
also in regard of Satan's maine opposition against them. What he in malice does
most assault, we in wisdom must most defend, and set foot to foot against
him: if an enemy bring all his forces against the chiefest Tower of a City,
wise Citizens will thither bring their best munition, and strongest defense: if
thus we deal with Satan, we shall oppose godly wisdom to his wicked
subtilty, and so keep our selves safe from all his assaults. This is the
wisdom which the Apostle here teaches us by those several pieces of Armor,
which follow to be handled: for they are all concerning heavenly things, and
tend to the salvation of the soul.

THE FOVRTH PART.
A repetition of the means.
Ephesians. 6. 13. For this cause take unto you the whole Armor of God, that ye
may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
. 1. Of repeating one and the same thing.
HEre the Apostle returns again to the second part of his former direction,
and repeateth in effect the very same things which he delivered in the 11.
verse: namely, how we may keep our selves safe against the forenamed enemies.

We may not think that this his repetition is vain and idle: Why we are
again and again called upon to put on armor.
for he was guided by Gods holy Spirit, who does nothing in vain. Note what
Joseph says of the iteration of one and the same thing to Pharaoh in two
dreams, Genesis 41. 32.
The dream was doubled the second time, because the thing is established by
God, and God hastes to perform it. Many good reasons may be given why here
the Apostle thus repeateth his direction, as, to show,

1 That what before he had delivered, was upon very good advice delivered: not
rashly, so as he doubted whether he might stand to it or no, but so as he dares
avouch it again and again, as being an infallible truth, which he also knew
to be a truth. Gal. 1. 8. 9.
Like to that thundering denunciation of a curse against all that should preach
another Gospel, which he lays down twice together.

2 That it was a needful, behoouefull, and profitable truth: a most
sovereign and necessary means to keep us safe: necessary for us, in regard
of our own inabilitie to stand fast without it; sovereign in regard of the
sufficiency of the means, which can and will (being rightly used) keep us
safe. Phil. 3. 1.
Mark the reason why it was not grievous to the Apostle to write the same
things, even because to them to whom he wrote, it was safe.

3 That naturally we are backward and sluggish in using this armor: therefore
he thought it not enough once to urge the point, but again presses it. Thus
Pro. 2. 1, etc. and 3. 1, etc.
Solomon often repeateth diverse exhortations. So Captains when they see their
soldiers loath to arm when there is great need they should arm, will call
upon them again and again to arm. Use 1. Weighty points often to be urged.


Ministers may here learn, as just occasion is given, to call their people to
the remembrance of weighty points, especially such as they observe their people
most backward unto. It is not sufficient once to have delivered such a point,
but again, and if need be, again it is to be urged. The Apostle having
propounded Christ a pattern of patience to the Hebrews, because he was a most
worthy and perfect pattern, Heb. 12. 3.
he calls them (...).
again to consider him. Thus shall Ministers show that they make a difference
betwixt points of less or greater need; and that they have respect to the good
of their people.

Objection. Many will say that Ministers want matter, and therefore repeat the
same things.

Answer. The very same may be objected against the repetitions used by the
Prophets, by Christ himself, by his Apostles, and other faithful and able
Ministers. But let Ministers see that they do it not upon idleness, but just
cause, and then need they not fear such cauils.

People must here learn patience, not to snuff, Use. 2. Patiently hear the
same things often.
or be discontent if they hear the same thing again, which before they heard.
This impatiency argues an 2. Tim. 4. 3.
itching ear, which cannot endure a repetition of any thing, and if shows
that they have more respect unto the ear, the^ to the heart: Number. 11. 6.
like the Israelites, which had more respect to their outward taste, then to
their inward nourishment, and thereupon loathed Manna because they had so often
tasted of it. This makes people get them an heap of Teachers. 2. Tim. 4. 3.


In particular concerning the present point in hand, Use. 3. This point of the
Armor of God a weighty point
persuade we our selves, that it is a point worthy to be attended unto with all
diligence, and to be observed with good conscience; that so we may give the
more earnest heed thereunto, and not let it slip. Have we also an holy
jealousy and suspicion over our selves, fearing lest we should be too
careless in using these means for our safety, yea, too incredulous in
believing the good use and benefit of them. Therefore rouse we up our selves:
for where the Spirit is most earnest in urging a point, we must be most
heedefull in marking it.

. 2. Danger must make watchful.
BEfore we come to the particular branches of this verse, note the inference
of it upon the former, which is plainly implied in these words, (...)
For this cause, that is, because ye have such terrible enemies as have been
described unto you, Take the whole Armor, etc. By this inference the Apostle
gives us to understand, that,

The more dreadful and dangerous our enemies be, Doct. The more dreadful our
enemies, the more watchful we.
the more careful ought we to be to stand upon our guard, and to look to our
defense. This is in effect the same that was delivered in the beginning of the
12. verse, we will therefore no longer insist upon it.

. 3. A resolution of the verse.
THis verse may be divided and branched forth as the 11. verse was.

The Sum of it is a Direction to instruct us how to defend and keep our
selves safe against the Devil.

The parts are two. The first shows what are the means of safety. The second
declares the end why these means are to be used.

In the first he declares, 1. What the means be. 2. How to be used.

The means are the very same which were delivered in the 11. verse, namely,
The whole Armor of God. I shall need to speak no more thereof.

For using the means, the Apostle sets down an other word then before:
there he said; Put on: Here take unto you. Both words in general employ one
and the same thing. This latter word is a compound word, and signifies
sometimes, (...)
To take up, or to take unto your selves: Sometimes to take again, or recover.
We are said to take up unto our selves such things as we have not of our
selves, and to take again or recover that which we have lost or let go. Both
significations may be here applied.

. 4. Whence our defense comes.
FRom the first I gather, that,

The graces whereby we are armed, Doct. 1. Our defeece is not from our selves.
are no virtues or qualities which arise from our selves: for then it were
improperly said; Take unto you. These graces are some of those especial gifts
which Iam. 1. 17.
come from above, which we 1. Cor. 4. 7.
receive.

By nature we are borne in our souls as naked and destitute of spiritual
Armor, Reason.
as in our Job. 1. 21.
bodies of outward clothing. Read Ezec. 16. 4. 5. etc.

every perfect gift comes from the Father of lights. Iam. 1.5.
He gives it to such as seek it by faithful prayer in the means appointed
by him, which are his holy word and Sacraments. When there is news of the
enemies coming to invade our Land, and thereupon Proclamations and Edicts sent
forth to charge all to arm themselves: then every one that either regards
his own safety, or his Sovereigns charge, seeks out armor: and to the
Armories do they which have none, resort. We have the same motives to stir
us up to seek spiritual armor.

. 5. Of the repair of Grace.
FRom the second I gather that,

The graces which are decayed in us, Doct. 2. Grace decay ed, may be repaired.
or seem to be lost, may be resumed and recovered. Thus much intimates Christ
unto Peter, saying, Luke 22. 31.
When thou art converted, etc. This cannot be meant of his first conversion,
which long before was wrought in him, but of his recovery. The Prophets often
call upon Gods people, who had made themselves naked, and fallen off from their
Lord and Captain the Lord God, to return again unto him. Very express and
direct for this purpose is the Reu. 2 5.
charge of Christ to Ephesus, Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent,
and do the first works. Psalm. 51. 10. 12.
Was it not the recovery of grace which David so earnestly prayed for? In faith
he prayed, and was heard.

Two strong props there be to strengthen our faith in the recovery of grace.
Reasons.
One without us, which is the Author of grace. The other within us, which is
the seed of grace.

1. It is God who is the author of grace, 1. God is the Author of Grace.
who as in his nature, so likewise in his properties, is unchangeable: so that
the same cause which moved God for to bestow the graces of his Spirit on a man,
Iam. 1. 17.
still remains in him to make him renew his Spirit, and that is his mercy and
goodness, which can no more be turned from his children then the Sun be pulled
out of Heaven. Simil.
A cloud may hinder the bright beams of the Sun, yet still it shines, and
will at length break forth: so the beams of Gods kindness by the clouds of
our infirmities may be kept from us, but still there remains mercy in GOD,
which will at length break through those Clouds. For whom God once loves 1
Ioh. 13. 1.
he loves unto the end: and in this respect the graces of his holy Spirit are
termed (...)
gifts without repentance.

2 The seed of grace is not 1 Pet. 1. 23.
corruptible, 2. The seed of grace is incorruptible.
but incorruptible. 1 Ioh. 3 9.
The Apostle calls it the seed of God: this seed is the holy sanctifying
Spirit of God, which Ioh. 7. 38, 39 and 4. 14.
Christ very fitly compares to a springing well, out of which flow rivers of
water of life, whereby supply and repair of grace, if it fail, may be made.
Now 1 Ioh. 3. 9.
this seed remaining in them who are borne of God, who can doubt but that which
is decayed or impaired in them through negligence, security, pride, or any
infirmity, may be repentance be renewed and recovered?

This highly commends the riches of Gods mercy, Use 1. The riches of Gods
mercy.
who contenteth not himself that once he has well armed and prepared his
soldiers against their enemies, but is still ready to make repair of that
which is battered, shattered, or lost through the violent assaults of the
enemy, or through their own negligence. One would think it sufficient that
once he bestowed on us whole Armor, even such as is sufficient to keep us
safe, if our selves be not in fault. But when through our default any of the
pieces thereof are faulty or missing, to make it all up whole again, much
amplifieth his goodness.

This also shows a maine difference betwixt the Law and the Gospel. A
difference betwixt the Law and the Gospel.
'For the Law leaves no place to repentance, nor affords any means to
resume that which is lost, or recover that which is decayed, but utterly
condemns a man for that which is lost or decayed: for it says; Cursed is
every one that continues not in all things which are written in the Book of
the Law to do them. Gal. 3. 10: But the voice of the Gospel is Mat. 3. 2. and
4. 17.
Repent, Ioh. 5. 14. and 8. 11.
sin no more, Ezec. 33. 11.
Turn you, turn you from your wicked wai^s; for why will ye die? I may in
this respect resemble the Law to 1 Samuel 26. 8. etc.
Abishai, the Gospel to David: Both of them found their enemy: Abishai would
presently have smote him stark dead: but David waketh him, tells him in what
danger he was, admonishes him to look better to himself. Thus the Law
sets forth the rigor of Gods justice, the Gospel the riches of his mercy.

. 6. Why the whole Armor is to be used.
THe end why this whole Armor is to be used, now follows. It consists of
two branches, (...)
First to withstand, which implies a fight. Secondly, to stand fast, which
implies the issue of the fight, victory, and conquest: both of them amplified
with a circumstance of time, but in a differing manner. The first has respect
to the time present ( in the evil day.) The second to the time past ( having
done all.) In setting down the end, he also declares the benefit of this
Armor ( that ye may be able) whereof we have spoken on the 1. (...)
verse.

The word whereby the end in the first branch is expressed, is not altogether
the same that was used in the 11. verse. The word there used was simple (...)
to stand. Here it is compound (...)
to withstand, or stand against. This is a word of defiance and combat, and it
also implies the manner of fight, which is face to face, hand to hand, foot
to foot, not yielding an hairs breadth to the enemy.

. 7. Of manfull standing.
Here then are two duties to be observed of all such as have taken unto them
the whole Armor o^ God.

1 That stoutly they stand against their enemies, Doct. 3. Stand stoutly.
and bid them defiance: Hereof we shall speak more on the first word of the
next verse.

2 That they give no place unto them. Doct. 4. Give no place to the enemy.
This is a duty which the Chap. 4. v 27
Apostle in express words commands. Iam. 4. 7.
Often it is implied under this word that is here used. Mat. 4 3. etc.
A worthy pattern we have hereof in the example of our Lord and General, 1
Pet. 5. 9.
Christ Jesus, who still withstood Satan in every assault, and would not yield
any whit at all in any of his temptations.

Our arch-enemy is both crafty as a Fox, Reason.
and cruel as a Lion: his craft will make him soon epsy and take an
advantage: his cruelty will make him follow it to the uttermost.

Great is their folly who first yield a little, Use Great folly to yield a
little.
and then think well enough to acquit themselves: they much deceive
themselves: for after they have once yielded, they have neither will nor power
to stand, as they had before. For as Satan is subtle, so is Heb. 3. 13.
sin deceitful: who once has tasted of it, will scarce content himself
with a taste, but will still more and more hunger after it. Thousands are
deceived therewith, and by small yeeldings at first, at length clean
overthrown. An especial point of wisdom it is duly to consider our own
folly and weakness together with the Devils craft and power, how in our
selves (without this Armor) there is no comparison betwixt us and our enemies:
yea, also to consider the nature of sin, and our pronenesse thereunto; that
so we may resolutely set our selves against all temptations, not yielding any
whit at all to any. Who almost finds not by woeful experience that a little
yielding has caused a great overthrow?

. 8. Of the evil day.
THe time against which the forenamed Armor is prepared is next to be
handled. It is here termed (...)
the evil day. By evil is meant not so much sin as trouble: and day is put
for any continuance of time. Some take evil day for the whole time of a man's
life, yea for the continuance of this World, all which time Satan assaulteth
us, but no longer.

This I take to be too large an extent of this phrase, for in the original
there is to each word adioined an article, that day, that evil day, which
implies some set and distinct time; wherefore other restrain it to the day of
a man's death: but that I take to be too strict a restraint: there are many
other days and times wherein use is to be made of Armor. Wherefore in the
mean betwixt both, I expound the evil day to be that time wherein Satan
shall any way set upon us and assault us, whether by outward afflictions, or
otherwise. All his temptations tend to evil; and therefore the time wherein he
assaulteth us may well be termed an evil day.

Quest. When comes that day?

Answer. It is no more known before hand then the day of death, or the day of
judgment. Whenever the Lord lets loose the raines to Satan, then is that
evil day. That time wherein the Devil deprived Job of all he had, smote his
body with sore boiles, vexed him by his wife and friends, were evil days to
Job.

. 9. Of Satan's being loose.
IN that the Apostle tells us of an evil day, he implies

There he times appointed wherein the Devil shall be let loose, Doct. 5.
There are times where in the Diue^l shall be let loose.
and have liberty to assault us. This the Apostle expressly foretold, saying, 2 Timothy 3. 1.
There shall come perilous times. Mark the answer that was made to the
souls under the Altar, Reu. 6. 10. 11.
That they should rest till their brethren which should be killed as they were,
were fulfilled. Thereby is declared, that as they which were dead had their
evil days, so the living should have their evil days. The Acts 14. 22.
Apostle makes a necessity hereof, and puts a must unto it, saying; We
must through many afflictions enter into the Kingdom of God. As there are
common times of trial for whole Churches, so for particular persons. There is
small reason for any to doubt hereof, but it is a point of good wisdom for all
to look for it. For who is there that has not felt some experience hereof,
and by his own experience can verify the truth of this point?

The Lord will have all his tried: Reasons.
for so is his own power, mercy, and wisdom the more manifested in his
Saints; and so are his enemies the more confounded. Besides, the Lord will
hereby make a difference betwixt his Church here on earth, and in Heaven.

Be not secure, as if no evil day could or would come: Use. Be not secure.
this is a most dangerous conceit, whereby the Devil gets great advantage,
for thus he suddenly surpriseth many: and yet it is the conceit of too too
many; In their peace and prosperity they think there shall be no alteration,
they shall never be moved: not only Psalm. 10. 6.
careless worldlings, but oftentimes Gods children fall into this conceit, as
Psalm. 30, 6.
David. Take we heed hereof, though for a while we think all well, yet
always it shall not be so: the evil day comes sooner upon some; later upon
others; longer it tarrieth with some, shorter with others, yet it comes upon
all: though it be uncertain when it comes, and how long it tarrieth, yet
most certain it is that it will come.

. 10. Of preparation against trial.
AS another use of this, mark the next point, for in regard hereof the Apostle
counsels us to prepare against it: yea, he makes mention of the evil day,
as of a motive to make us watchful and careful to arm our selves against it.
Now then in that he bids us take armor, that we may stand in the evil
day, his counsel is, that

Preparation must be made before hand, Doct. 6. Preparation to be made against
time of trial.
against the time of trial. Job 1. 5.
The care which Job had for his children before hand, must we have for our
selves. It should seem that he himself looked for the evil days that came
upon him: for he says; The thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, d
Job 3. 25.
etc. And this was it which made him Iam. 5. 11.
so well endure so sore assaults. Very careful was Christ in preparing the
Disciples against his departure, because he knew there were evil days coming
upon them. The last petition of the Lords prayer tends to this purpose.

If preparation be not before hand made, Reason.
we may suddenly be surprised and overcome, Judge. 18.
like the people of Lat^h. But if we be well prepared, we may well be the more
secure.

What is like to be the issue of them who put the evil day far away from
them, Use. Be not careless.
and never think of resisting the evil one till he set upon them? Many thus
plunge themselves into much misery. The children of this world are in this
respect wiser then many Christians: for they use in time of peace to have their
trainings, musterings, tiltings, and many other martial exercises, that thus
they may be beforehand prepared for war.

Let us in the time of our greatest tranquillity meditate of the evil to come:
Use 2. In time of peace meditate of the evil day.
and for our help herein, observe what evil falls upon others, and consider
the like or worse might have fallen, or may afterward fall upon us: and
therefore thoroughly examine our selves, and search what faith, what hope, what
righteousness, what sincerity, what other good and needful graces we have in
us, that we be not to seek of our Armor when the Devil comes to assault
us.

Hitherto of the first branch, concerning the End of arming our selves.

. 11. Of the multitude of trials.
THe second follows, wherein the circumstance of Time is first laid down,
and first to be handled: It is in these words, having done all things; that is,
having well passed over all those brunts, whereunto ye shall be brought, and
well acquitted your selves.

Here first the Apostle implies, that

Many trials are to be undergone, Doct. 7. Many trials to be passed through.
many assaults to be withstood, before we can look to be free and safe. Acts
14, 22.
Through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God. Psalm. 34. 19.
Many are the troubles of the righteous. This was presented unto us in Christ
our head, and in all his faithful members in all ages, in Patriarchs,
Prophets, Apostles, etc.

The ancient Jews were an especial type hereof. Canaan, a place of rest and
quiet was promised unto them; but before they entered into it, they went into
Egypt, and were there bondmen; from thence they came into the Wilderness,
where they were brought to many straites and difficulties; and lastly, many
sore battles fought, before they could have rest in Canaan.

This partly arises from Gods good and wise ordering matters to his own
glory, Reasons. See the reason of Doct. 1. on verse 11.
and his childres good: and partly from Satan's insatiable cruelty, who never
thinks he has assaulted enough, so long as a Christian soldier stands: It
was a sore blow he gave Job when he deprived him of all his goods, and
children; a blow that might have stricken another clean down, yea, stark
dead: but because he stood stoutly, he lent him another blow, which was much
sorer; yea, still he laid on with all his might, till God would suffer him to
strike no longer. The like insatiableness is manifested in his instruments:
Instance Saul's pursuing of David, and the Pharisees persecuting of Christ: they
were never satisfied.

Think not the Christian combat ended when some few battles are fought, Use
1. A few skirmishes finish not the Christians combat:
and that thou art now out of all danger, because through Gods mercy and power
thou have hitherto been delivered; rather expect and prepare for more. No
doubt but Peter thought himself safe enough, when one maid which would have
betrayed him was gone away: but Mat. 26. 69. etc.
we read that a second came to him, yea others also. Wherefore so long as
Satan has liberty, (which will be so long as we, or any other man lives in
this World) let us be watchful, and still prepared for many assaults one after
another. Many stout victorious Monarchs have been overthrown, because after a
conquest they feared no fresh assault, and so have been suddenly surprised. It
should seem that Belshazzar was so overtaken, Dan. 5. 1. 30.
because the same day that he made his royal feast, himself was slain, and
his kingdom taken by Darius.

trials whereunto they are brought, Many are often assaulted, who are not
forsaken.
God has utterly forsaken them, and given them over to the power of their
enemies; this then may serve for their comfort, and as a prop to uphold them,
that God does thus order the estate of his children, that many things must be
done and finished before we can look for rest.

. 12. Of holding out.
THe word which the Apostle uses to set down the time of conquest, (...)
is a word of perfection, and implies a full and final ending of a matter: to
it he adds a very general particle all: (...)
whereby he teaches us that,

It is not sufficient well to begin the fight, Doct. 8. All assaults must be
held out.
and make a good onset, nor yet to hold out the brunt of some assaults, but all
how many soever, and of what kind soever must be held out, all must be finished
before we can look for victory. He that says all, excepteth not any at all.
Heb. 10, 32, 33, etc.
This perfect finishing of all, is it whereunto the Apostle so earnestly
exhorts the Hebrews, and plainly tells them, that yet longer they were to
endure, because Heb. 12. 4.
they had not resisted unto blood, and therefore not finished all. In this
respect says Saint James, Iam 1. 4.
Let patience have her perfect work. This was Christ's care, Joh 4. 34.
to finish all: therefore when he was going to his triumph, he said, and 17. 4.
I have finished the work, etc. and again, and 19. 30.
It is finished. So the Apostle ( 1. Cor. 11. 1.
who would have us follow him, as he followed Christ) 2. Tim. 4. 7.
I have fought a good fight, and have finished my course.

The promises of reward are restrained to this condition, Reasons.
Mat. 10. 22.
He that endures to the end shall be saved. Reu. 2. 10.
Bethou faithful unto the death* and I will give thee the crown of life. To
all those seven Churches of Asia, to which Christ wrote, he promised a reward,
but with a prouiso of Reu. 2. 7. 11. 17 26, and 3. 5, 1^, 21.
ouercomming He that prevails in some conflicts, and is at length
overthrown, cannot properly be said to overcome: so that Gal. 3. 4.
all which is done, is in vain, if all be not done: For mark what the Lord
says; Heb. 10. 38.
If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. Saul fought many
of the Lords battles valiantly; but he withdrew himself, and the Lord forsook
him, so as at length he was overthrown. Was not the glory of all the former
victories utterly dashed hereby? did not the Philistims as much (if not so much
the more) insult over him? So will the Devil.

Be careful to add constancy unto courage, Use. Constancy.
if thou desire the crown of conquest; and though thou have done many things,
yet give not over so long as there remains any thing to be done. Do not so
much consider what conflicts have been endured, as how many are yet still to
be endured. Regard what is to come, rather then what is past. Phil. 3. 13.
This was Saint Paul's mind. Many in all ages, who have done many things, have
lost the crown of glory, because they have not done all. I would the times and
ages wherein we live, did not afford so many examples of backsliding, as they
do. Many have fallen, more are like to fall: the times are evil, men are
weak, all of us prone to faint.

. 13. Of the issue of constancy.
YEt for our encouragement, note the last word of this verse, to stand, wherein
the second branch of the end here propounded, is laid down. To stand, in this
place is a note of victory: it implies that Satan notwithstanding all his
power, malice, subtilty, fury, sedulity, with the like, cannot overthrow them
that are well armed; but as Conquerers, when all the conflicts are ended, they
shall stand safe and sure, even the last in the field. It is here added as the
issue of the former point, as if he should have said; If manfully ye withstand
your enemies, at length ye shall stand as conquerers over them. Doct. 9.
Constancy gets conquest.
The point here to be noted is this, that Courage and constancy brings
assured conquest and victory. The In the reasons of Doct.
promises before mentioned intimate as much. That Iam. 4. 7.
which Saint James lays down as the issue of resisting the Devil, is in
effect the very same which is here laid down. There it is said; the Devil will
fly; here, we shall be able to stand: The Devils flight and our standing do
both imply a conquest. This was the Iam. 5. 11.
end which we know the Lord made at the end of Iohs patience. Hence it is that
the Apostle andv 12.
counts the man blessed that endures tentation.

Gods honor is otherwise impeached, Reasons.
if they which finish all be not crowned as co^querers: 1 Cor. 15. 19.
of all men Christ's soldiers are otherwise the most miserable. Where then is
the privilege of enduring? wherein lies the difference betwixt those which
fight under Christ's banner, and others, if not in prevailing? For the time
Christ's soldiers are commonly much more sorely assaulted. But herein
consists the difference, Heb. 13 5.
that they are never forsaken, 1 Cor. 10 13
that the Lord will give a good issue; that though they are brought unto
temptation, yet they are never cast into it: Psalm. 125 3.
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous.

In all conflicts have an eye to this end; Use. Look to the issue.
though your enemies be many and fierce, yet fear not, ye shall stand when
they shall fly. Patiently wait, and faint not. Isa. 28. 16.
He that believes shall not make haste: for God who alone can end the fight,
stands by: he orders all the assaults, for number, measure, kind,
continuance, and every other circumstance; and knows when and how to
determine all. Therefore courageously withstand your enemies, that ye may
victoriously stand. For Vicisse est aduersari^s non cessisse. Hier. in Ephesians. 3.
to give no place to the devil is to overcome the devil.

THE SECOND TREATISE
Of the particular pieces of Armor.
THE FIRST PART.
The duty of such as have those pieces.
Ephesians. 6. 14. Stand therefore having your loins girt, etc.
. 1. Of the Coherence.
Unto the forenamed general direction the Apostle adds a particular
exemplification of the same, distinctly setting down certain special graces,
whereby as with pieces of Armor we may stand fast. This exexemplification is
set forth in form of an exhortation, wherein note,

1. The duty whereunto he exhorts.

2. The means and manner how it is to be performed.

The duty is in this word (...)
stand. Though this word be the same with that which immediately before is set
down, yet is it not of the same mood, That was of the infini^^ue mood, and
employed an honor and dignity.
nor of the same tence. That was a standing after the battle is ended, and so
a word of conquest: this is a standing in the battle, and so a word of
conflict: this is of the imperative mood, and implyet^ a duty; and not one duty
only, but many duties: for it is a metaphorical word taken from soldiers:
and according to the diverse acceptance of the metaphor, it implies diverse
duties.

. 2. Of a Soldiers standing.
1. A Souldier-like courage: for as white-liuered, fresh water, faint-hearted
soldiers are ready upon every brunt to yield and run away: so valiant
courageous soldiers stand stoutly against every brunt; and will rather stand
and die, then stir and yield.

2 A settled abiding in ones proper place, or standing in his rank, neither
straggling abroad, nor going into any others place. Experienced soldiers well
know what a safeguard it is to have the rancks well kept, and therefore will not
step aside.

3 A watchfulness opposed to luskishnesse and sluggishnesse: an heavy headed,
idle, luskish soldier, is ever ready to lie down, like a tired Ox or Horse;
but a wise watchful soldier stands to receive his enemy whenever he
makes any assault.

4 Perseverance with armor still on the back: faint-hearted weak soldiers
being loath long to bear the burden of their armor, will often put it on and
off: when a skirmish is past, off goes the armor, and so is laid aside till
they be forced again to put it on: but old well experienced soldiers stand
still with their armor, looking for a fresh assault, and for more conflicts.

. 3. Of Christian valor.
1: WE must be of a valorous courageous mind against all our enemies, Duty 1.
Stand stoutly
standing stoutly against them, and bidding defiance to them all, even as 1 Samuel 17. 45
David stood against Goliath. How needful this is in war against flesh and
blood, appears by Ios. 1. 6. 7. 9.
Gods earnest urging of it to Ioshuah: But much more needful it is in war
against Spirits.

For they, though bold enough, Reasons.
yet are daunted with the stout standing of Christ's soldiers; but heartned
with timorousness. Besides, the courage of some valourous soldiers adds
spirits to all their fellows.

That we may with courage stand against our enemies, Grounds of encouragement.
observe these and such like grounds of encouragement.

1 That Ios. 1. 5
the Lord is with us, and will not fail us.

2 That 1 Samuel 17. 45
we fight in his name and power, but our enemies in their own.

3 That Judge. 11. 27. 29.
out battle is most just, and we fight in a just cause.

4 That we fight with Col. 2. 15.
enemies spoiled, whose weapons are blunted, Heb. 2. 14.
whose power is limited.

5 That we have 1 Cor. 10. 13
promise of victory, and so are sure not to be overcome.

. 4. Of keeping our rank.
2. Duty 2. Abide in thy place.
WE must be careful to 1 Cor. 7. 20.
abide in the place where our Lord has set us. For this know, that we have a
doubling calling, one general, as we are Christians. The other particular, as
we are distinguished in Church, Ephe. 4. 1.
Commonwealth, or Family. Accordingly these two points are to be observed.

1 That we remain steadfast in the true Church where the Lords banner is
displaied: that we retain our profession, and start not from it for gain as 2 Timothy 4. 10.
Demas, or persecution, as 16.
they which forsook Paul. Straggling soldiers lose the succor of their
Captain, and help of their fellow soldiers. Such straglers from Christ's
armies are separatists, heretics, time-seruers, and all reuolters.

2 That we be conscionable and diligent in the several functions of our
particular callings: as in the Commonwealth, Kings, Judges, Justices, all
Magistrates, all Subjects also, all of any Office, Trade, etc. In the Church,
Ministers, other Church Officers, and people. In the Family, Masters and
Servants, Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children. For this end are
particular duties prescribed to particular functions in Gods word. Many weighty
reasons there be to urge this.

1 1 Cor. 7. 17:
God has appointed to every one his distinct place. Reasons.
Now it was the commendation of Christ, and of Moses, that they were Heb. 3. 2.
faithful to him that appointed them.

2 Every one shall be called to account for those duties which belong to his
particular calling; according to that which was said to the Steward, Give an
account of thy stewardship. Luke. 16. 2.

3 The order wherein every one is set, is the very beauty of the Church, and
of the body of Christ: as the several places of several members, are the
grace of a natural body; Yea, this order is the strength of the Church, as in
an army: in this respect the Apostle says, that the body of Christ is Cha. 4.
v. 16. (...)
fitly joined together, and firmly compacted.

4 The graces which God bestows on us, as faith, love, obedience, patience,
wisdom, etc: are best exercised, and manifested in our particular callings.

5 In our proper distinct places, we have Psalm. 91. 11.
the Lords promise of protection, but not out of them. Many judgments has God
executed on busi bodies, that entered upon others places; instance Number. 16. 12,
etc.
Corah and his conspiracy, 2 Samuel 15. 2, etc.
Absalom, 2 Chr 26. 16
Vzziah, etc.

Wherefore we are to take good notice of our particular places, and of the
particular duties belonging unto them, and both pray and labor for skill and
ability to perform them. Prou. 14. 8.
It is the wisdom of the prudent to understand his way.

. 5. Of watchfulness.
3. We must be 1 Pet. 5. 8
warchfull, and stand upon our defense against our enemy; he Mat 24. 43.
as a thief will suddenly set upon us; coming when we are not aware of him.
Duty ^. Stand on thy guard.
For the better performance of this duty, we must Luke 21. 3^.
take heed of such things as may breed in us a spiritual slumbering and
drowsinesse, as are earthly delights and pleasures, worldly cares, etc. They
which will watch, 1 Pet. 5. 8.
must be sober.

. 6. Of perseverance.
4. Persevere: Duty 4.
WE must persevere and continue in well employing the graces of Gods Spirit to
our defense: thus may we better stand in the spiritual combat, then in our
outward bodily fight: for our bodies have need to have the armor put off, for
their ease and refreshing: but our souls have no such need. The armor of God
is Mat. 11. 30.
not burdensome to the spirit. Of this duty I spoke more fully in the 12.. of
the fourth part.

Thus much for the duties which this first word stand implies.

THE SECOND PART.
The kinds of the pieces of Armor prescribed.
. 1. Of the several pieces of the Armor of God in general.
THe next point is, concerning the means or manner of standing, in the words
following, having your loins girt, etc.

In the 14. 15. 16. and 17. verses, there are six several graces of the
Spirit, compared to six several pieces of Armor, which are especial means
to make us stand fast. They are these, 1 Verity. Compared to 1 a Girdle. 2
Righteousness. 2 a Brestplate. 3 Patience. 3 Shoes. 4 Faith. 4 a Shield. 5
Hope. 5 an Helmet. 6 Word of God. 6 a Sword.

Out of this particular enumeration of these several graces and pieces of
Armor, I will deliver three or four general observations, and then
distinctly handle them one by one, as they lie in order.

. 2. Of defending our selves.
MOst of these several pieces, Obs. 1.
even all of them but one, are defensive; that one which is offensive, namely
the word of God, The most part of a Christians Armor is defensive.
compared to a sword, is also defensive, as well as the rest: whereby it is
intimated that,

We that are Christians must rather seek to defend our selves, then annoy
others. This was represented in that combat which our Lord fought with the
devil: For Mat. 4. 1. etc.
Christ was led aside of the Spirit into the wilderness, and being there, the
tempter came first unto him, and first set upon him: here we see that there was
a necessity to move Christ to fight, and that in a double respect. First, in
that he was brought into the lists. Secondly, that being there, he was
assaulted. In this fight Christ especially aimed to defend himself, and to
repel his adversaries weapons. Therefore all his answers are framed directly
according to Satan's objections. The like we may observe in his conflicts with
the instruments of Satan, the Scribes, Pharisees, Herodians, etc. as also in
those conflicts, which his Prophets Apostles, and other Saints have had with
Satan, and his instruments.

Hereby we see that we fight in a just quarrel: Reason Our quarrel is just.
for what iuster cause can there be, then for a man to defend himself, and his
own right?

Object. But defendants are often in the greatest blame.

Answ. True, when they keep men from their own right, and make them recover
it by force. But we keep nothing from Satan which is his due: he seeks to
get those from Christ, whom Christ has dearly bought, even with the price of
his own blood. It is therefore a Diabolical property to raise unjust quarrels,
and by force to seek to wring from any that which he has no right^ unto. If
we be thus set upon, lawfully we may defend^ our selves, and with confidence
call for Gods aid, yea also in faith depend upon him,

. 3. Of resisting.
ONe offensive weapon, the word of God, 2 Obs. Repel the enemy.
which is a Sword, is put into our hands, so that just occasion being offered,
we may and ought to do our best to repel and drive away the devil, and his
instruments. Hereof I shall speak more largely on the beginning of the 17. ver.

. 4. Of standing at defiance.
EVery part and piece of this Armor, 3 Obs. No safety in flying.
is for the forepart of a man, never a piece for his back, or hindparts. What
does this imply, but that we should always stand against our enemies face to
face, and never show them our backs, never fly from them? but have Neh. 6. 11.
N^hemias holy resolution, and say, should such as we fly? Often we are stirred
up to fight, wrestle, stand, resist, etc. never persuaded in the whole book of
God to fly, that is, to yield the victory unto Satan. We may wisely avoid his
temptations, and not yield to them, when by them he seeks to draw us from the
service of our Lord, to his slavery; and thus 1 Cor. 10. 14.
we are commanded to to fly from idolatry, to 2 Timothy 2. 22.
fly from the lusts of youth, etc. But timorously to cease from resisting
temptations, and withstanding the Devil, is dangerous to our selves, and
dishonorable to God: it makes Satan even insult over God himself, Diabolus
non opus aliquod aliud operatur, nisivt subuertat: hic est cibus illius, hi^
honor, hoc and gaudium, Chrysostom in Mat. 4. hom. 5.
whose soldiers we are, and get great advantage against us; for flying from
God whom have we to fly unto? being out of Gods protection the Devil will
soon make a prey of us. Let us not think, that if we yield the field, the
Devil will be contented: It is not the glory of conquest that he seeks, so
much as our destruction: 1. Pet. 5, 8.
He seeks whom to deuou^e

. 5. Of the sufficiency of our Armor.
IN this particular enumeration of these several pieces, Obs. 4. Every part
fenced.
I find a Christian soldier armed from top to toe: for here is an Helmet for
his head and face: a Brestplate, together with the tassets and cushes, from
neck to middle, and from thence to the knees: a Girdle to knit them together;
greaues from knees to the soles of the feet; a Sword for the right hand, and a
Shield for the left. Well therefore might the Apostle term it whole Armor.

whole Armor over with any other, and so needlessly clog the soul: yea it is
derogatory to Gods honor and wisdom, and a degree of presumption. Such are
they as acknowledge and believe that the word of God is perfect, and yet think
it no harm to have humane traditions added thereto: or that Christ only is
able to save, and yet the help of Saints to do no harm: or that faith only
is sufficient for justification, and yet no hurt to join works also with
faith, in the office of justifying a sinner, etc.

whole Armor, and every piece of it, and so we may well content our selves
therewith, boldly may we defy our enemies having it on, and not fear what
they can do unto us. These uses have been largely handled, so as I need not now
further insist upon them.

THE THIRD PART.
Girdle of Truth.
Ephesians: 6. 14. Having your loins girt about with Truth.
. 1. Of the diverse kinds of Truth.
THe first piece of spiritual Armor here in order set down by the Apostle,
is Truth. In handling whereof I will show, first what Truth is here meant.
Secondly, how fitly it is compared to a Girdle: Thirdly, what account is to be
made thereof. Fourthly, what wyles the devil has to wrest it from us:

For the first, There is in man a fourfold truth.

1. Of judgment. Four kinds of truth. Truth of judgment.
2. Of heart. 3. Of speech. 4. Of action.

Truth of judgment is, when a man's judgment agreeeth with Gods word, which is
the touchstone of Truth: so as the principles of that Religion which he
professes, and his opinion concerning the same, are grounded thereon, and may
be warranted thereby. When the understanding of man, being enlightened by Gods
Spirit, and informed by his word, remains settled and established in that
doctrine which the word of God teaches, then is there Truth in his judgment:
this Truth was it for which 2. Pet. 1. 12.
Saint Peter commended the distressed Jews to whom he wrote, and which chap.
4. v. 15
Saint Paul exhorts the Ephesians to follow. This is opposed to error.

Truth of heart is the singleness and sincerity thereof, 2. Truth of heart.
whereby a man seeks to approve himself unto God the searcher of all hearts,
and to be accepted of him: Psalm. 51. 6.
this is that truth in the inward affection which God loves, and Isai. 38. 3.
wherewith Hezekiah comforted himself, yea which he pleaded before the Lord,
when he had received a sentence of death. This is opposed to hypocrisy.

Truth of speech is an agreement of the word of a man's mouth both with his
mind, 3 Truth of speech.
and also with the matter which he utters. This is it, whereunto we are
exhorted, Ephesians. 4. verse. 25. speak the truth. And Romans 9. 1.
which the Apostle often affirms of himself. This is opposed to lying, 1 Tam.
2. 7.
when a man speaks against his mind and conscience: and to falsehood, when a
man speaks contrary to the thing it self.

Truth of action, 4 Truth of action.
is a plain, faithful, and honest dealing in all things, whether we have to
do with God, or man; when men neither make show of doing that which indeed
they do not, or of doing it otherwise then they do: Ioh. 1. 47. (...)
this truth was in Nathaniel, in which respect Christ called him an Israelites
in truth. This is opposed to dissimulation and deceit.

. 5. What kind of Truth is here meant.
SOme apply the Truth here mentioned, to doctrine and religion, as if only the
soundnes of it were meant: others restrain it to the uprightness and
sincerity of our hearts and affections: others understand it of the truth of
our words and speeches: and others expound it of the purity and innocence of
our practice and carriage.

But whosoever exclude any of these forenamed branches of truth, come (as I
take it) short of the Apostles meaning; all of them must concur to make up
the strength and beauty of this Girdle. For truth is a general property,
Truth as salt.
which as salt seasoneth every thing, and makes it sauory to God and man: the
whole lump must be leauened with it, I mean the whole man throughout, his
opinion, his affection, his communication, his conversation.

1 Truth of judgment is the ground of all the rest: Truth in judgment the
foundation to the rest.
for though our hearts be never so sincere, our speeches never so true, our
actions never so plain, yet if in judgment we be misled, all is but as straw
and stubble, which when it comes to the fire of trial, will soon be
consumed. It seems that before Paul was instructed in the truth of the
Gospel, he had a kind of truth in his heart, for he Act. 22. 3.
was zealous toward God; yea also in his speeches and actions, for Phil. 3. 6.
he was unrebukable concerning the righteousness which is the Law: yea, Act.
26. 9.
he thought in himself he ought to do what he did: he had not a double heart,
a double tongue; he pretended not what he never intended; yet because he wanted
truth in judgment, all was but Phil. 3. 8.
dross, and loss unto him.

2 To truth of judgment, To truth of judgment, add truth of heart.
must truth of heart be added, or else notwithstanding the soundness of
doctrine which we profess, we make our selves odious and abominable to God:
for God gave man but one single simple heart: if any have Psalm. 12. 2. (...)
an heart, and an heart, the Devil has given him a double heart, it is no
part of Gods Image, God will not acknowledge it. Judas knew the truth of
Religion, and preached it as well as the other disciples, but wanting truth in
his other parts, what good got he thereby, but the witness of his conscience
against himself?

3 But what if a man which professes the true Religion, Where truth of heart
is, there is truth of speech and action.
think he has a single heart, and yet be given to lying, and to deal
deceitfully? Surely he disgraceth his profession, and gives just cause of
suspicion, that he has no honest heart: for the heart is as a fountain. Out
of the abundance of the heart, proceed a man's words and actions: yea the heart
is as a Queen, and has a command of a man's tongue, and of al his outward
parts: so that if there be truth in it, there will be truth in all the other
parts: sincerity in the heart will keep the tongue from lying, and the whole
carriage of a man from dissimulation and deceit. We see then that of necessity
all these four branches of truth must be joined together to make up this
girdle.

. 3. What kind of Girdle is here meant.
how fitly Truth is compared to a Girdle.
concerning the metaphor, and the fit application of this grace of truth. This
speech of (...)
girding the loins, is in Scripture taken in a double sense: one for trussing
up a man's garments, the other for close and fast tying his harness together:
in the former sense the metaphor is taken from travelers or runners: for in
those countries they were wont to wear long aside garments, which if they were
not tucked up, they would hang dangling about the heels of such as traveled or
run a race, and so be a great hinderance unto them. In this sense this
metaphor is 1 King. 18. 46
often used, 2 King 4, 29.
and thereby Gods people were taught Exodus 12. 11.
to remove all impediments in their Christian course and journey, Luke 12. 35.
and to be as well prepared as they could be to perform the work of the Lord.
In the latter sense the metaphor is taken from soldiers, who are wont to knit
their Armor close and fast unto them, and so tie their loins hard, partly to
keep their Armor from loosing and shaking, and partly to keep their body
steady. Job. 38, 3. and 40. 2.
In this sense the Lord said to Job; Job 38. 3. and 40. 2.
Gird up thy loins like a man: That last phrase Like a man, shows that he
speaks to him as unto a soldier, whom he would have to stand steadfast, and
to hearken unto him.

Here it is to be taken in this latter sense, and signifies a souldier-like
girding of the loins: for which purpose, they who wear armor, use to have a
strong fair girdle, commonly called a belt, whereby they knit fast together*
and close unto their middle the upper and lower pieces of their armor, as
their breast plate, and their tassets and cushes. These belts as they were
strong, so they were set with studdes, being fair and large. There is a double
use of them: one to keep the several pieces of armor fast and close
together, and to hold the loins of a man firm, and steady, that he might be
able to stand the surer, and hold out the longer. The other to cover the ioints
of the armor, that they might not be seen. The first use was for strength:
the second for ornament.

. 4. Wherein a girdle is resembled to truth.
THus truth is both an ornament to a Christian soldier, Quid speciosius ips
averitate ad quam omnis spectator peruenire se cupere confitetur, etc. Aug. de
ver. Rel. cap. ^9
and also an excellent means of strength to uphold him. For it does both grace
and honor him before God and man; and also fast holds together other graces
of Gods Spirit, especially in temptation, when they are most shaken, and so
vpholdeth him. This will more evidently appear by the particular branches of
truth before mentioned.

1 What greater ornament and beauty to religion, Truth the best grace to
religion.
then soundness and evidence of truth? This is the very glory and crown
thereof: all other vain glosses, as antiqui ^^e, universality, unity,
uniformity, succession, consent, multitude, pomp, revenues, etc: being
separated from truth, a^ but as so many pearls in a blind eye, Simil.
which make it so much the more deformed: for, the more ancient, universal,
uniform, and pompous superstition, idolatry, or any false religion is, the
more odious, and detestable it is; but the more true and sound it is, the more
excellent and glorious it is.

So for strength, And the greatest strength. Simil.
what can better settle and establish the judgment of a man then truth? Great
is truth, and prevails. It is like a sharp sword in a weak man's hand, which
is able to pierce deep though there be but small strength to thrust it.
Veritas vinci non potest, multitudine hostiu^ non terretur. Hicron.
Truth cannot be overcome, neither is daunted with the multitude of enemies.
This is it which has made Martyrs in all ages to stand to their profession
unto death, and to seal it with their blood, rather then start from it; yea,
though many of them were illiterate men and weak weomen.

The like may be said of the other branches of truth: Truth is a come lines in
every thing.
an upright and sincere heart makes a man amiable before God himself. 1 Kin
15. 3. 4. 5.
David being a man of a single heart, is termed, Acts 13. 22.
A man after Gods own heart. And Genesis 6. 8, 9.
Noach being an upright man, found grace in the eyes of God.

No eloquence or learning can so grace and commend a man's speech as truth: for
lying and falsehood, are parts of that Cha. 4. v. 29.
foul and filthy communication, which the Apostle condemns. Pro. 6. 17.
The Lord hates a lying tongue: and 12. 22.
it is an abomination unto him.

No outward comeliness of body can so commend a man, as plain, faithful, and
honest dealing. 1 Ioh. 1. 47.
This made Nathaniel so gracious in Christ's eyes: but none more odious and
detestable to God and man, then dissembling, and deceitful persons: the
conscience of such makes them to shun the light, and be afraid of Gods
presence, Truth does much strengthen men.
as Gen 3. 8.
Adam. So likewise, truth in all these, does very much strengthen and uphold a
man in time of trial, and keeps him from fainting. Job 27 5, 6, and 31. 5.
This was the ground of Jobs courage and constancy. Isa. 38. 3.
This added an edge to Hezek^ahs prayers. Psalm. 26. 1.
This made David bold to refer himself to Gods trial and examination. 1
Cor. 4. 4.
This vpheld Paul against all that could be laid against him.

. 5. Of getting truth.
Pro. 22, 23. expounded.
Solomon, what account is to be made of truth.
who exhorts to buy the truth, and not sell it. This advice concerns two
sorts of men, 1. Such as have it not: they must labor to get it: 2. Such as
have it, they must hold it fast. That this direction may be the better
applied, we are well to search whether we have this girdle of verity or no.
Fitly may I apply that to truth, which 2 Cor. 13. 5.
the Apostle speaks of faith; Examine your selves whether ye have truth,
prove your selves. There is no grace which makes a more sensible difference
betwixt the children of God and of the Devil, then truth. In this examination
we must proceed in order.

. 6. How trial of truth may be made.
1. Trial is to be made of the truth of our judgment: 1. Search what truth
in judgment.
whether the religion which we profess, and all the principles thereof be
assuredly sound and true. To this tends 1 These. 5. 21
that exhortation of Saint Paul, Try all things; and 1 Ioh 4. 1.
that of Saint John, Try the spirits. For this end, the direction given by
Christ ( Ioh. 5. 39.
Search the Scriptures) is to be observed and followed, Acts 17. 11.
as it was by the men of Berea: for the Scriptures are Iam. 1. 18.
the word of truth, and 2 Timothy 3. 16.
the voice of God, the highest and chiefest Judge: a most perfect, sufficient,
impartial Judge. They who make any other Judge may soon be deceived.

Here see what wrong Popish guides do to their followers, in keeping from them
this touchstone of truth. See what idiots they be who think it sufficient to
believe as the Church does. Such are they among us, whose only ground of faith
is the common received Doctrine, be it true or false. No marvel they be soon
shaken and removed: they want this girdle of truth, which should strengthen
them.

2 If we find truth seated in our understanding, 2 Search what truth in heart.
then are we further to observe whether like the ointment powered on Aarons
head; Psalm. 133. 2, 3.
and the dew that fell on the mountains of Sion, it descend from the head to
the heart: whether the heart be upright before God or no. It appears that
David thoroughly searched his heart for the truth thereof, Psalm. 26. 1.
or else durst he not with such boldness and confidence have referred it to
Gods trial: Ier. 17. 9.
the like I might instance in Job, Hezechiah, Paul, and many others. Great
need there is of through trying the heart: for it is deceitful above all
things, and that not only to others who cannot discern the secrets thereof,
but also to men themselves, if at least they diue not into the bottom of it.
Some be such gross hypocrites, that they cannot but in their hearts condemn
themselves, as Acts 5. 3. 9.
Ananias and Saphira: others so simple as they beguile themselves, Mat. 26. 33.
like Peter and the other Disciples. In all ages many have thought better of
the integrity of their heart, then by proof and event it has fallen out to
be. The best trial of our heart will be by our disposition when we are
alone, or when we can conceal our thoughts and cogitations from all men, yea,
even from the very suspicion and conjecture of men: if then they be upright,
and therefore upright, because we desire to approve our selves to God, Genesis 39.
9.
as Joseph, then may we be assured there is truth in them.

3 From the heart which is a fountain, 3. Search what truth in speech and
action.
we are to proceed to the streams thereof, our speeches and actions; and
search whether from this clear spring there flow forth clear waters, and so
see what correspondency there is betwixt them. Now here we are not only to
observe whether our speeches do agree with our knowledge of the thing we
utter, and with evidence of the thing it self, or whether our actions be
plain, or fraudulent and deceitful; but also whether that true and good
communication which we utter, and those true and honest actions which we
perform, do come Luke 6. 45.
from the good treasure of a true heart. For our help in this trial, note
these few directions.

. 7. Directions for trial of truth in speech and action.
1. What is the ground of truth in our words and actions? 1. The ground of
truth.
what moves us thereunto? whether popular applause ( Mat. 23. 5.
as the Sribes and Pharisees, who did all to be seen of men, Ioh. 12. 43.
for they loved the praise of men more then of God) or credit and estimation
(as 1 Samuel 15. 30
Saul) or profit (as Genesis 34. 23.
the Schechemites) or respect to some men (as 2 Chr. 24. 2. 17.
Ioash and his people) or desire of quiet and avoiding trouble, (as Est. 8. 17.
they which became Jews in Mordecaies time) or company and example of others,
(as Acts 5* 1.
Ananias and Saphira) or intent to work some mischief, (as 1 Kin. 21 9.
Iezabel, and Ier. 41. 6.
Ishmael. These and such other by-respects being the ground and cause of our
actions, do plainly argue that there is no sound truth in them.

2 What is the extent of that truth we make show of? 2. The extent of truth.
whether it be in all things. Heb. 13. 18.
This was the proof of the Apostles good conscience: for truth is a leven 1
Cor. 5. 6.
which seasoneth the whole lump. So as they which at sometimes, and in some
things are watchful over their words and actions, but careless at other times
in other things, want this leven of truth, as Mas. 6. 20.
Herod.

3 What the things are wherein we are most strictt? 3. The object of truth.
whether they be matters of greatest weight and moment? They who pretend much
truth in small and light matters, and are careless and dissolute in great and
weighty matters, have no sound truth in them. Mat. 23. 23.
Such were the Scribes and Pharisees.

4 What order we observe? 4. The order of showing truth.
whether first we begin with our selves, and look to our own speeches and
actions. Mat. 23. 4.
Many will be more forward and zealous in stirring up others to all manner of
truth, then themselves: yea, they will check others for failing in such things
wherein themselves are most faulty: surely there is no sound truth in such.
Mat. 7. 3.
Christ makes this a note of hypocrisy.

. 8. Of buying truth.
THus are we to search our selves thorowout, and if upon this search we
cannot find that we have this girdle of verity, then we must observe the first
part of the Wisemans advice, How to buy truth.
Buy the truth, that is, use all the means which possibly we can, for
attaining unto, and possessing it: yea, though it be with a departing from, and
forsaking of many things which seemed profitable and pleasant unto us, because
they and truth could not well stand together. The Metaphor of buying implies a
letting go of some things, for the attaining of other things. Excellently is
this set forth unto us by two Mat. 13. 44, 45.
parables which Christ uttered, one of a man that bought a treasure, and
another of a Merchant that bought a pearl. Truth is a rich treasure, and a
precious pearl: if the worth of it, and the need which we have of it, were
well known, I doubt not but easily we should be persuaded to part with much
for the getting of it. Veritas propter seipsam diligenda est, Aug. in Gal.
So excellent it is, that for it self it is to be loved.

. 9. Motives to buy Truth.
I Will therefore first lay down some motives to stir up in us a desire of
truth, and then some directions, to instruct us how to get it.

For the first, note the excellency: 2. The necessity: 3. The benefits of truth.

1 Excellent must that needs be, The excellency of truth.
which makes us like to God: but nothing can make us more like to him then
truth: for he is the Psalm. 31. 5
Lord God of truth, Ioh. 14. 6.
his Son is truth, Ioh. 14. 17
his holy Spirit the Spirit of truth, Iam. 1. 18.
his word, the word of truth; Psalm. 11. 9.
his promises, commandments, judgments, ways, works, all truth. Herein do
the glorious Angels and Saints resemble God, Mat. 6. 10.
whom to imitate is an excellent thing: Ioh. 8. 4.
most contrary is the Devil, and all that bear his image.

Besides, Truth is a kind of perfection in all Christian graces; yea, (...).
the greatest perfection that we can attain unto in this life, Genesis 6. 9. and
17. 1.
one and the same word in Hebrew, signifies both integrity or uprightness and
perfection, so as some translate it upright, some perfect. In regard of this
quality, Psalm. 26. 1.
we may appeal to Gods judgment, but not in any other kind of perfection,
^sa. 38. 3.
whether of degrees, parts, measure, or the like, so that in this respect it
has an excellency above all other graces.

2 So needful it is and necessary, 2. The necessity of truth.
as without it no other grace can be of any use. Faith, hope, love, and all
other graces, are as corrupt and putrified meat without it* Therefore the
Scripture commends 2 Timothy 1. 5.
faith unfeigned, Romans 12. 9.
love without dissimulation, Iam. 3. 17.
wisdom without hypocrisy, etc. Yea, also lips unfeigned, innocent hands,
etc.

No knowledge, Mat. 5. 20. and 6. 2. and 23. 14.
no righteousness, no good thing can stand an hypocrite in any steed. What
good got Saul, Judas, Ananias and Saphira, Simon Magus, and such other
hypocrites, Hypocritae ab inspectore cordis Deo mercedem non capiunt, nisi
fallaciae supplicium. August. de sermon. Dom. in morte. lib. 2.
by all those seeming excellent gifts, which they made show of? all they did
was odious before God: Therefore notwithstanding the Pharisees prayed often, gave
much alms, fasted often, duly paid their tithes, with the like; yet Christ
denounces many woes against them, Mat. 23. Hypocrites receive no reward of God
the searcher of hearts, but the punishment of deceit.

3 Such is the benefit of truth, 3. The benefit of truth.
that the least measure of grace seasoned with it is acceptable to God, and in
that respect very profitable to us. It is noted of those which in Hezechias
time came out of Ephraim, and other tribes of Israel, unto Jerusalem to keep
the Passover, 2 Chr. 30. 18, 19, 20.
that they had not clen^ed themselves according to the Law, whereby they
provoked the Lord to inflict some judgment upon them: but Hezekiah putting the
Lord in mind how they came with their whole heart to seek the God of their
Fathers, the Lord healed them. Well might Psalm. 119. 1.
David pronounce the upright blessed, for as Psalm. 51. 6.
God loves truth, so Prou. 11. 20.
the upright are his delight, and Psalm. 84. 11.
he has promised to withhold no good thing from them.

Thus we see what good reason we have to buy truth. Observe now how it may be
gotten.

: 10. Means to get truth.
FOr truth of judgment, How truth in judgment is gotten.
we must resort to the place where it may be had, that is the true Church, 1 Timothy 3. 15.
the pillas and ground of Truth. In it is the fountain of Truth, the holy
Scriptures: in it flow forth the streams of Truth, by the Ministry of the
Word. Be thou one of the members of the true Church, so shall thou have a right
thereunto: Search the Scripture, frequent the Ministry of the Word, so shall
thou find Truth. Rather then go without it, let go honor, wealth, pleasures,
ease, and all thy natural and carnal lusts: let go all. Baul had surely a
good mind to buy the Truth for Phil. 3. 8.
he counted all things loss for the excellent knowledge of Christ.

For truth in heart, How truth in heart, speech and carriage is gotten.
speech and carriage, remember that thou stand always in the presence of
God, and that thou have to do with him whether thou art alone, or in company,
doing any duty that appertains to God or man; and in respect hereof, let thy
care be to approve thy self to God: Thus shall thou get Truth. For mark the
charge which God himself gave to Abraham, Genesis 17. 1.
Walk before me, and be upright. The former part of this charge, is a cause of
the latter: the latter a fruit and evidence of the former, Genesis 39. 9
Joseph had well acquainted himself with Gods presence, which made him so
honest and upright.

This is it which makes men such dissemblers in their words and actions, that
either they know not Gods presence in every place, or believe it not, or think
not of it, or regard it not. Man's presence makes many be faithful, just,
honest, etc. Surely Gods presence must needs work much more, if it were duly
weighed, or else men have Atheistical hearts. Let us set God always before
us, and depart with any thing rather then offend him, and thus shall we come to
be upright.

. 11. Of keeping Truth.
AFter that Truth is gotten, Sell not truth.
our next care must be fast to hold it, and thereby manifest that great
account which we make of it. Sell it not (says the Wise man) by no means upon
any condition, for any respect let it go: for then 2 Pet. 2. 20, etc.
it had bin better for us never to have had it. All the good we reap by verity
and integrity, after it is lost, is this, that another day it will rise up in
judgment, and be an heavy witness against us. Some men make such account of
some Jewels they have, that no preferment, no favor, no wealth, no office,
nothing can purchase them; and yet it may be that their jewels are not worth
the price which is offered for them. Should not we much more esteem of Truth,
for which no sufficient price can be given? The holy Confessors and Martyrs in
all ages have well known the value of this jewel, and in that respect
preferred it before their livings and lives: they would not let go Truth of
doctrine: Genesis 39. 9.
Joseph would not let go Truth of heart and action, for love nor fear.

. 12. How truth of doctrine is assaulted.
THis latter point of fast-holding and safe keeping Truth, IIII. Point. Satan's
wyles to wrest truth from us.
is the rather to be regarded, because the Devil and his instruments (not
ignorant, that if this Girdle be wanting, all other pieces of Armor will stand
us in no stead) have been in all former ages, and still are busy to get it
away from us, sometimes by fair enticements and allurements to draw us from
truth of doctrine: on the one side are brought many plausible arguments,
agreeable to the natural humor and reason of man, (such are most of
theargume^ts which Papists use;) on the other side much trouble and great
persecution is raised. If they c^not clean overthrow Truth, yet they will do
what they can to adulterate it: witness the Prophets and Apostles times, and
every age ever since: I would our age and Country were free from it. Behold
how busy Popish Jesuits, Priests and Friars are: what would they not give?
what would they not do, to dispossess us of the Truth of Religion?

. 13. How sincerity is assaulted.
SO likewise for sincerity, how do profane worldlings seek to wrest it from
us? endeavoring to make us odious to all, because we will not yield to them.
These are as spitefully bent against us for sincerity, Truth and honesty in our
heart, words and actions, as Papists are for verity and soundness of doctrine.
For some hate those that are honest and upright (as 1 Kin. 22. 8.
Ahab hated Micaiah;) some scoff at them (as Genesis 21. 9.
Ismael at Isaac,) saying, plain dealing is a jewel, A cursed proverb.
and he that uses it will die a beggar. Yea they will not stick to brand them
with the odious terms of hypocrisy and dissimulation, though of all sort of
people they are farthest from it: especially, if God suffer any affliction to
fall on them, (as Job 2. 6, and 9.
on his servant Job) then with e Jobs wife and friends, they will be ready to
vpbraid unto them their integrity and uprightness, as if all had been only
in show to bleare men's eyes. But if any that indeed with an hollow heart have
made profession, do fall away, and so be discovered (as Judas, Ananias,
Demas, and such other) their examples shall be cast in the teeth of the most
upright.

And if, notwithstanding all this, they shall remain constant (as Job did) and
not suffer their innocence and integrity to be outfaced, Job 27. 5.
then will they object against them the censure of other men, and say of them,
How soever ye think of your selves, yet others, and those good men too, think
not so well of you: if ye were wise, you would give more credit to other men's
judgment, then to your own: for men are blind and partial in judging
themselves.

Many by these and such like discouragements have been moved to make no
account of Truth, but to leave it to such as better esteem it them they:
Others, to cast it away, and to yield to the times, both for Religion and
conversation, showing themselves as superstitious or profane as the worst. I
will therefore as an antidote against those poisonous objections, discover the
vanity of them, and show how these wyles may be avoided.

. 14. Of the necessity of Truth in Religion.
1* AGainst fast holding Truth in judgment, two things are especially
objected. One, that it is not necessary: The other, that it is dangerous.

Object. 1. They say it is not necessary, Whether a man may be saved in any
Religion.
because a man may be saved in any Religion.

Answ. This is a most salse and impious position, the very bane of true
Religion. The Apostle expressly says, there is Chap. 4. v. 5.
one faith. In that Christ terms himself Ioh. 14. 6.
the Way, the Truth, the Life, does he not imply that he is the only true way
that leads to life? Gal. 1. 8.
That curse which the Apostle thundreth out against all that preached any
otherwise then he had preached, ought to terrify us from yielding to any thing
but the Truth. 2 These. 2. 12
He pronounces them damned which believe not the Truth.

. 15. Of the pretended danger in maintaining Truth.
Object. 2. THe danger which they allege, is either in regard of conspiracies,
treasons and insurrections which Princes and Gouernous are subject unto, if
they be too stiff in maintaining truth of Religion: or persecutions which
subjects are like to fall into, if they be too resolute in professing the Truth.

Answ. For the danger of Princes and Magistrates, God protecteth defenders of
truth.
they need not to fear (...) because they have God to watch over them, and to
be their protector, so long as they maintain the Truth. Not to search after
examples of other ages and places, consider how miraculously God preserved
Queen Elizabeth (of blessed memory) both from invasions of enemies abroad, and
also from many conspiracies of Traitors at home. After 44. years, and 4.
months prosperous Reign, in peace she ended her days, notwithstanding all
dangers whatsoever. Many Treasons, close, cruel Treasons, such, as the like in
all former ages have not been heard of, have also been intended against our
present royal Sovereign: what has been the issue? They which laid the snares
were caught themselves, and he yet remains safe, (and long may he remain
safe.) Surely God has respect to the Truth, which has bin, and still is
maintained in this land. Henry the French King.
Our neighbor King thought to avoid danger by letting go ^he Truth, and
yielding to idolatry: but thereby he cast himself out of the protection of the
God of truth. What followed thereupon? To be persecuted for truth a matter of
joy.
One sorry villain slew him in the midst of his guard.

As for the persecution which is raised against others, Mat. 5. 10, 11*
it is a note of blessedness, Luke 6. 13.
a matter of rejoicing: and in this respect a strong motive to persuade us fast
to hold Truth.

. 16. Of the pretended trouble of conscience, which sincerity is said to cause.
2 AGainst truth of heart, and remaining steadfast therein, are objected, 1.
Vexation of mind. 2. Wearisomnesse. 3. Outward troubles. 4. The judgment of
other men.

Object. 1. The Devil suggesteth to many, that it is impossible always to
keep the heart upright: and that if there be a little failing, the conscience
is so troubled, as it can hardly (if at all) be quieted: and thereupon
infers, that it is best not at all to regard truth of heart.

Answ. Truth keeps from despair.
There can be no better, no more sovereign a preservative against trouble of
conscience then truth of heart. Job 27. 5, 6.
This kept Job from despair: this made Hezekiah bold. Isai. 38. 3.
Truth of heart is a strong prop to a man in the midst of his manifold
infirmities: for it is impossible to keep the heart free from all corruption,
but yet there may be truth in heart. Every corruption, though it argue
imperfection, yet it argues not hypocrisy, if it steal into the heart against
our honest purpose, and against our earnest desire, and being discerned,
causes godly sorrow, and Christian watchfulness, both in purging the heart of
that which is intred in, and also in keeping it that the like enter not in
again. But where there is no truth of heart, it is utterly impossible that
there should be any sound comfort. If such a man's conscience be ever troubled,
it will be overwhelmed and drowned in despair.

. 17. Of the pretended wearisomnesse of Sincerity.
Object. 2. Again, he suggesteth that it is a wearisome thing to keep the
Girdle of Truth always close unto us. None can hold out, the most upright have
fallen away, as Demas and others.

Answ. Truth is easy and sweet.
It seems wearisome only to those who never felt it, never knew it. I may
say of it, as Mat. 11. 30.
Christ of his yoke, It is easy and light. Yea, it is sweet and pleasant to
him that indeed tasted of it. As for those which have fallen, they never had a
grain of Truth in their hearts: all the show they made, was only a show: Mat.
13. 21.
They fell because they had no Truth in them. Had they been upright, 1 Toh. 2.
19.
they would have continued so, Psalm. 37. 37.
for mark the up right man: the end of that man is peace.

. 18. Of the pretended judgments on the upright.
Obiesct. 3. FVrther, he infers that the vprightest are plagued as much, if
not more then others. How then can their uprightness be pleasing to God?

Answ. Gods corrections no tokens of his wrath.
Corections are not takens of Gods wrath, Heb. 12. 5, 6.
but of his love, when they are laid upon his children. The upright have many
judgments inflicted on them for proof of their uprightness, (as Job 1. 11,
12.
Job) and therefore for their good, and for their glory, yea also for the glory
of God.

. 19. Of others opinions concerning a man's sincerity.
Object. Esides he labors to persuade men that they deceive themselves, in
thinking they have truth of heart, when they have none, because other men judge
not so well of them, as they themselves.

Answ. Truth best discovered by a man's own heart.
No other man can so well discern the Truth of heart, as a man's own self: 1
Cor. 2. 11.
For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in
him? As other men may judge an hypocrite to be upright, when the hypocrite in
his own conscience knows himself to be so: so they may judge an upright man
to be an hypocrite. But another man's judgment cannot make the hypocrite to be
upright: why then should it make an upright man an hypocrite? the hypocrites
conscience condemns him, though all the world acquit him: and the upright
man's conscience will uphold him, as Jobs did, though all the world condemn
him. 1 Ioh. 3. 11.
Believed, if our heart condemn us not, then have we boldness toward God. For
Romans 14. 4.
every one stands or falls to his own master.

. 20. Pretended hindrances of plaine-dealing.
3 AGainst Truth in words and deeds are objected, I know not what hindrances
and inconveniences.

Object. 1. Truth is an hinderance, in that it keeps men from much gain: for
some say, there is no living without lying, and using the common secrets of
Trades.

Answ. Gain gotby deceit is no gain.
It were much better to want gain, then to get it by any deceit of word or
deed. Pro. 20. 17.
The bread of deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth shall be
filled with gravel: and 28. 22.
A curse remains upon that gain which is deceitfully gotten.

But this pretext of hinderance is a mere pretext, Truth the best means of
gains
utterly false: for there is not a more sure means of gain then truth in word
and deed: and that in a double respect.

1. Omnes vehementer ne fallantur inuigilant. Aug. de ver. (...) c. 29.
Because most men desire to deal with such: so as they shall have the best
custom: no man is willing to be deceived, but all desire that others should
truly and plainly deal with them, howsoever they deal with others.

2 Because Psalm. 1. 12. 1, 2 etc.
Gods blessing (which brings gain, and Prou. 10. 22.
makes rich) goes with the upright.

. 21. Pretended inconveniences of plain dealing.
Object. 2. THe inconveniences are, that Job 12 4.
the upright are laughed to scorn: they are a byword in every man's mouth,
yea, they are trodden under every ones feet,d they are made a prey.

Answ. All these we may put as flowers into our garland of glory, and rejoice
in them, as we heard of persecution: for Luke 6. 22.
Christ makes them kinds of persecution.

Thus we see that Truth notwithstanding all that can be objected against it,
Veritas multis impugnantibus suscitatur, and crescit. Chryso. hom. 4. de laud
Pauli.
is worth the keeping: all the cauils of the Devil and his instrument are of
no force to make us little regard this girdle of verity, or lightly to let it
go: yea, such is the virtue of Truth, that like the Palm tree, the more it is
pressed down, the more it grows.

. 22. Of holding truth more steadfastly for opposition.
LEt us do with this and other pieces of spiritual Armor, as men do with
their cloakes which cover their bodies: if the wind blow hard against them,
they will so much the faster and closer hold their cloakes. Even so, the more
Satan strives to deprive us of our spiritual robes, the more careful and
steadfast ought we to be in keeping them.

In particular for this girdle of verity, it is so much the more highly to be
accounted of by us, who are the Lords faithful soldiers, by how much the
less reckoning is made thereof by the greater number of people.

In these days all is for show, What little regard of truth most have.
little or nothing in truth. As building, wares, apparel, and the like, are
all of the sleightest stuff, but with the fairest gloss and show that may be;
so our religion and all things else. That religion which outwardly is most
glorious and pompous, is of most embraced, as being the best; whereby it
comes to pass that Popery has gotten such liking of many. Who almost is
careful to set himself always in Gods presence, and as Genesis 5. 22
Enoch to walk with him? Many who seem very devout at Church, seldom or
never have any religious exercise at home in their Family, much less in their
closets before God. For their words, they shall be as fair as may be before a
man's face, but full of falsehood, yea, most bitter and virulent behind a man's
back. And for actions, all are to bleare the purblind eyes of men. All the
care is to keep credit with men: wherein while men think to deceive others,
they do most of all deceive themselves, and their own poor souls, which
shall another day answer for this deceit.

THE FOVRTH PART.
Breast Plate of Righteousness.
Ephesians. 6. 14. And having on the breast plate of righteousness.
. 1. Of Righteousness m general.
THe second piece of our Spiritual Armor is Righteousness, Veritas vbiq,
matter est sanctitatis, Chrylo. hom. 19. in Psa. 118.
compared to a breast plate. Fitly is this inferred upon the former: for truth
is the mother of righteousness, they cannot be severed. In handling this
point, I will show, first, what righteousness is. Secondly, how fitly it is
compared to a breast plate. Thirdly, how this breast plate is put and kept on.
Fourthly, what is the benefit of it Fifthly, what are the wiles of the Devil to
keep us from it.

what righteousness is.
an holy quality wrought in us by Gods Spirit, whereby we endeavor to square
and frame all our thoughts, words, and actions, unto the righteous rule of the
Law of God. It is that which we commonly call (...). Iustitia est virtus qua
sua cuique tribuuntur, Aug. de lib, arb. lib. 1.
Justice, a virtue whereby is given to every one their due, whether it be to
God or man. Righteousness is often restrained to that part of justice, which
respects man, and so is the sum of the second Table; but then either some
other word is joined with it, which has reference to God, as Holiness, Luke
1. 75: or else some circumstance of the place restrains it to man, as Deuteronomy.
24. 13. But otherwise, when there is no other word or circumstance which
restrains it, then it extends it self to the whole Law, as here.

The Law of God is a right and perfect rule, and declares what is due to God
and man, so that a conformity thereunto, is righteousness.

. 2. Of the kinds of Righteousness.
Object. THis is such a piece of armor, as none in this life can attain unto,
but Christ Jesus the true natural Son of God, who by an excellency and
propriety, is called (...). Acts 22. 14.
That just one. Of him it is properly said; Isa. 59. 17.
That he put on righteousness as a breast plate. Indeed at first, Eccle. 7. 31.
God made man righteous, and in Heaven the Saints shall be all Heb. 12. 13.
just and perfect: but on earth Romans 3. 10
there is none righteous, no not one.

Answer. Legal righteousness.
There is a double righteousness mentioned in the Scripture, one legal,
framed according to the exact rule, and strict rigor of the Law. The other
E^angelicall, accepted according to the gracious favor and limitation of the
Gospel. The Law requires two things. First, an absolute perfection in every
part, point, and degree thereof. Secondly, this perfection in that very party
who is justified thereby. Romans 10. 5.
For Moses thus describes the righteousness which is of the Law, that the
man, (even the man himself, in and by himself) which does those things (even
all those things which are written in the Law, according to the uttermost
extent of them) shall live thereby: but Gal. 3. 10.
cursed is every man that continues not in all things, etc.

By the Gospel both those are limited, and the rigor of them mitigated.
Evangelical righteousness.
For there are two parts of Evangelical righteousness, one Romans 10. 6
of Faith, the other of Heb. 13. 18
a good conscience.

The righteousness of faith is Christ himself, Righteousness of faith.
with his righteousness imputed to us, and by faith received of us* in which
respect Romans 10. 4. expounded.
Christ is said to be the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that
believes. The end of the Law is to justify and save those which fulfill it.
Now we, by reason of the flesh dwelling in us, cannot fulfill it. Christ
therefore subjected himself thereto, he perfectly fulfilled it. To them which
believe, his perfect righteousness is imputed; so as they are justified and
saved thereby. Thus is Christ the end of the Law, and that, which by the Law
was exacted of our own persons, by the Gospel is accepted for us in Christ,
who performed it. This Righteousness of Faith is comprised under the fourth
piece of Spiritual Armor, verse 16. Here therefore is especially meant the
righteousness of a good conscience. Righteousness of a good conscience.


. 3. Of that Righteousness which is here meant.
THis Righteousness is a powerful work of Gods Spirit in the regenerate,
whereby they endeavor to approve themselves unto God and man, by performing
what Gods Law requires to be performed unto both.

I term it, First, A work of Gods Spirit, because it is the Romans ^* 11.
Spirit which quickens, and enableth us to do what we do.

2 Powerful, because we are by nature Ephesians. 2. 1.
Dead in sins, and 2 Cor. 3. 5.
not able of our selves so much as to think a good thought

3 In the regenerate, for Ioh. 3. 6.
that only which is borne of the Spirit, is spirit.

4 Acts 24. 16.
Endeavor, for this being true and earnest with the very uttermost of our
power, Heb. 13. 18.
is the greatest perfection which in this World we can attain unto.

5 To approve to God and man, because Mat. 22. 37, 39.
duties are required toward both.

6 What Gods Law requires, because that shows what God does approve, and
what man should approve. Luke 1. 6.
This was that righteousness for which Zac^ary and Elizabeth were commended.

This consists of two branches, First, to abstain from evil. Secondly, to
do good. Psalm 119. 3.
David describing a righteous man, says; Surely he does none iniquity, but
walks in the way of God. Psalm. 34. 14.
Often does the Scripture join those two together, Isa. 1. 16, 17.
as two essential parts of righteousness: except these two do concur, the
breast plate is not sound.

. 4. Of resembling Righteousness to a breast plate.
Righteousness fitly resembled to a breast plate.
(...).
The original word translated breast plate, properly signifies that part of
the body, wherein the vital parts, as the heart, lungs, liver, and the like
do lie: the whole upper part of a man's body before, even from the neck to the
thighs, is comprised under this title. Hence is it, that that piece of armor
which covers this part of the body, has the same name. The use of this piece
is to keep safe the vital parts, and preserve a man from being mortally
wounded, or killed downright.

Thus does righteousness keep the Christian soldier safe and sure, Leo. in
retia saepe lapsus capitur, sanctivero cum ligantur, fortiores siunt. Chrysostom ad
popul^m hom 4
that the Devil with all his assaults cannot pierce his soul, and so utterly
destroy him. A Lion which is strong among beasts, ( Prou. 30. 30.) may be taken
and destroyed (1 Samuel 17. 3. 6.) but so cannot the righteous. This use of
righteousness will yet more evidently appear, Nothing but sin can wound the
soul.
if we consider what it is that does indeed mortally wound the soul, and
draw^forth the vital blood and very life of it. It is sin, and nothing but
sin, that can destroy the soul. By it did Satan first wound and kill our first
Parents. By it has he from time to time prevailed in the World. For sin
first provoked Gods wrath; procured the curse of the Law; brought death and all
the concomitances thereof: 1 Cor. 15 56
The very sting of death is sin. Sin first kindled hell fire, and still
continues to blow up and inflame the same.

Where the breast plate of righteousness is well put on, there sin has no
power. Righteousness is as contrary to sin, as water to fire, and it will
soon quench the heat of sin.

. 5. Of putting on the breast plate of Righteousness.
How Righteousness is put on.
which, according to the proper notation, and true meaning of the (...).
word, is a change of the mind, namely, such a change as brings forth a
reformed life. This true alteration of the mind and heart, first causes a
through detestation of our former wicked course, together with an utter
abiuration, and renouncing of the same: and then an holy resolute purpose to
lead another kind of life, and instead of former sins to practice contrary
duties: as if a man in former times have been profane, to be so much the more
religious for the time to come: if a blasphemer before, more careful to honor
the Name of God; if riotous, so much the more sober, etc. These are Mat. 3. 8.
fruits worthy of repentance. So long as these two fruits of repentance, First,
an utter detestation of all former wickedness, Secondly, a constant
resolution, and faithful endeavor, to perform new obedience, remain in our
hearts, the Devil cannot easily, if at all prevail against us. But if the
mind be not altered, and a through change wrought therein, though there should
be some means to restrain us from sin, and provoke us to do many good
things, yet would the Devil soon get advantage against us. Heb. 3. 13.
Sin is deceitful; 1 Pet. 5 8.
Satan is subtle and busy; if therefore we be not altered in our hearts,
the means of restraint being removed, soon shall we be brought to return
unto our old wicked course, like the 2 Pet. 2. 23.
dog to his vomit, and the sow to the mire: for though the sow be outwardly
washed never so clean, yet because her swinish nature is not altered, so soon
as she comes at mud, she besmeeres her self again by wallowing in the
mire.

. 6. Of the benefits of Righteousness.
The benefit of righteousness.
are many and great.

1 It keeps us from being mortally wounded, as we heard before: for so long
as we retain a true purpose, and faithful endeavor answearable thereto, we
shall never give our selves over to commit sin.

Object. They who have had the most holy resolution have been wounded, and
that very deeply: witness many of the best Saints, as Neah, Lot, David,
Peter, and others.

Answer. 1. At such times as they fell so foully, they forgot their resolution;
their breast plate was laid aside. 2. Though the sins of such seemed gross
and mortal in the kind or outward act, yet were they not so in their manner of
performing them: they did them not with a full swinge and sway of will; their
soul was not (to speak properly) mortally wounded: for all their wounds
(though they seemed very sore and deep) were cured; yea, many times their
slips and falls were like unto the breaking of a man's arm, or leg; which being
well set again, is the stronger.

2 It brings great assurance of our effectual calling, and spiritual union
with Christ, yea even of our eternal election, and salvation. For Chap. 1. 4.
God having chosen us that we should be holy, they that indeed are holy, may
be sure they are chosen of God, and borne of God. To this purpose says Ioh.
2. 29.
Saint John, If ye know that he is Righteous, ye know that every one which does
Righteousness, is borne of him. Being sure of these, how can we be mortally
wounded?

3 It procures a 2 Cor. 8. 18.
good name in Gods Church while we live, and Prou. 10. 7.
a blessed memory after we are dead, 1 Pet. 3. 16.
if any speak evil of us, they shall be ashamed. Thus this Breast Plate
keeps them from many skars and scratches.

4 It confirms the truth of Religion, and so it may be a means 1 Pet. 3. 1.
to win such as are without, 1 These. 1. 6, 7
to strengthen those that stand, and 2 Cor. 9. 2.
to stir up all to an holy emulation.

5 It does highly honor our Lord and captain, whose soldiers we are. Mat. 5.
16.
This motive does Christ use to stir us up to put on the Breast Plate of
Righteousness.

. 7. Whether man's Righteousness be meritorious.
MAny and sundry are the wyles which the devil has against this Breast Plate,
V. Pomt. Satan's wyles against righteousness.
and those either to make it of no use, or to make us either not regard it, or
to wax weary of it.

He draws on some to crack and break this Breast Plate of Righteousness, 1.
Suggest. that righteousness is meritorious.
by beating it out further then the metal thereof will bear it, that is, (to
speak plainly) by making Righteousness to be meritorious. Heerewith he
beguiled the Scribes and Pharisees, and such as embraced their doctrine, and
egregiously has he besotted the Papists herewith.

For avoiding this decent, we are duly to consider what things are required to
cause merit, Answer. What things are required to merit.
and how far short our righteousness comes thereof.

Merit respects both the parties that give and receive the reward, and also
the work for which the reward is given.

He that upon merit rewards, must receive something for that he gives, and in
that respect is bound in Justice, to give the recompense which he gives.

He that meriteth, must

1 Be free, and not bound by duty to do that which he does.

2 Be able of himself, and by himself, even by his own power to do it.

3 Do nothing afterward whereby he forfeiteth that which once he has merited.

The work must both be perfect every way, so as no just fault can be found
with it, and also worth the reward that is given for it.

Our righteousness can attain to the height and pitch of none of these. Man's
righteousness cannot be meritorious.
For

1 It is God who gives the reward. But Job 22. 3.
is it any thing to the Almighty that thou art righteous? or is it profitable
to him that thou make thy ways upright? and 35. 7.
if thou be righteous, what give thou to him, or what receives he at thine
hands? If God receiue^ nothing by our righteousness, what is the bond whereby
he is indebted and obliged to us? Mat. 20. 15. Cum Deus coronat merit a nostra,
aibil aliud coronat quam munera sua. ^ug Epi^t. 105.
Mark the answer of the Lord himself, Is it not lawful for me to do what I
will with mine own? Whatsoever the Lord gives, upon mere mercy and favor he
gives, and in rewarding our righteousness, he rewards his own work.

2 It is man who works righteousness: but Luke 17. 10.
man is a servant unto God, many ways bound to perform all the service that
he can: yet is he not 2. Cor. 3. 5.
sufficient of himself to think any thing as of himself: but his sufficiency
is of God, Phil. 2. 13.
It is God who works in him both to will, and to do. Besides, if it were
granted that a man had at any time of himself, through his own power done any
thing, whereunto he were not bound, yet in other things has he sinned, (for
Romans 3. 23.
all have sinned) and thereby made forfeiture of his former merit.

3 Isai. 64 6.
All our righteousness being as filthy clouts, what show of perfection can
there be: if otherwise it were perfect, yet this conceit of merit would make it
imperfect: for this is not the end why it was commanded. If Adam in his
innocence, had had any conceit of merit, he had thereby stained his obedience:
this conceit does so de face the best work, that it makes it most odious: for
it is directly contrary to the free grace and All sufficient merit of Christ
Jesus. But if notwithstanding all this it were perfect, yet such is the glory
which God g^ueth, that our righteousness Romans 8. 18.
can no way be worthy of it. 2 Cor. 4. 17. (...)
It is a far most excellent and an eternal weight of glory.

If these points be seriously weighed, and if withal we daily take a view of
our righteousness, and compare it with the rule of Gods Law, and be truly
humbled for the defects and imperfections thereof this erroneous and arrogant
conceit of merit will not easily ^eaze upon us.

. 8. Of the use of Righteousness.
IF Satan prevail not that way, 2 Suggest. that righteousness is needless.
he will labor to persuade men that this Breast Plate of Righteousness is
needless, because Christ has wrought a full and perfect redemption, and left
nothing for them to do: by his Righteousness they shall be justified and
saved: so as they which have the shield of Faith, need not this Breast Plate. By
this wyle did Satan beguile many Christians in the Apostles time, taking
advantage by Saint Paul's sound and orthodoxall doctrine of justification by
faith without works: for the redress whereof Saint I ames, and Saint Jude
were moved to write their Epistles. Here* by also has he beguiled many in
these our days, who have been delivered from the darkness of Popery.

For avoiding this, Answer. Righteousness is needful to salvation.
we are duly to weigh what is the end and use of Righteousness. Though it be
not a meritorious cause of salvation, yet is it a means of attaining to
salvation, the way appointed of God for us to walk in thereunto; so that
although we be not saved for our Righteousness, yet we cannot be saved
without it; 1 Cor. 6. 9.
The unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, Heb. 12. 14.
Without holiness no man shall see God. For Ephesians. 1. 4.
God has chosen us that we should be holy: and Luke 1. 75.
Christ has redeemed us that we should serve him in holiness and
Righteousness. For this end appeared the grace of God, which brings
salvation unto all men, Tit. 2. 11, 12.
that we should live righteously. 1 These. 4. 7.
Unto holiness God has called us: and Ephesians. 2. 10.
we are created unto good works. Thus we see how false a suggestion it is,
that Righteousness should be needless; It is clean contrary to the express
charge of the Apostle, Tit 3. 14.
that we should learn to show forth good works for necessary uses.

Whereas it is pretended, Faith and righteousness have their distinct uses.
that the shield of Faith is sufficient, we are to hold it for a ruled case,
that God makes nothing in vain, Mat. 19. 6.
Those things which God has joined together, let no man put asunder. Wherefore
though we saw no diverse and distinct ends of Faith and Righteousness, yet God
having appointed both, both must be used. But there are diverse uses, apparent
to all that will observe them. Righteousness is needful to testify our
obedience and thankfulness to God, to profit our brethren, to prove our faith,
to give evidence of our election, vocation, and justification, and to maintain
our cause against the cauils of profanesse, impiety, wickedness, etc. Faith is
needful to apply Christ's Righteousness, to support us against the
imperfections, and defects of our Righteousness, and for many other good uses,
whereof we shall hear on the 16. verse.

. 9. Of the issue of Righteousness.
A Third slight that the devil has, 3. Suggest. that Righteousness is
likesome.
is to persuade men that this Breast Plate of Righteousness is very combersome
and toilesome, and it will make us weary; for it is against our natural
disposition, and will be an hinderance of honor, wealth, ease, pleasure, etc.
Herewith he beguiled Heb. 12. ^6.
Esau, 2 Timothy 4. 10.
Demas, and many other. I may too truly say it, that herewith he beguileth
most which profess the truth of Religion. Some cast away this Breast Plate for
promotion sake, not caring how they bribe, flatter, please and fawn upon great
men: others for wealth, oppressing, defrauding, and may ways wronging their
neighbors: others for their pleasures, profaning the Sabbath, swearing, eating
and drinking, unto gluttony and drunkenness, using unlawful games,
immoderately pursuing lawful pastimes, attyring themselves in strange
apparel above their estate, unbeseeming their place, etc. Others to avoid
outward reproach, for fear, directly against their heart and conscience (I
speak it with great horror of heart) are profane and unrighteous, Answer. An
eye must behad to the issue of Righteousness.
because it is counted a disgrace to be Righteous.

For avoiding this, we must have more respect to the assured issue of
Righteousness, then to some present seeming inconveniences thereof. We know
that the Armor which soldiers wear on their bodies, is for the time
combersome and heavy: yet for safety they refuse not to wear it: they consider
that it is much better to endure a small burden for a while, then to endanger
their lives, and lose the victory. Now such is the blessed fruit and issue of
Righteousness, that all the honor, profit, and pleasure that can be lost, or
all the reproach or shame that can be endured for it, are not worthy of the
Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge will give unto his
righteous servants. It were almost an infinite task to declare what the
Scripture, the word of Truth has delivered concerning the issue of
Righteousness. Generally it says, Psalm. 11. 7.
The Lord loves Righteousness. Psalm. 58. 11.
Verily there is a reward for the Righteous: Pro. 10. 6.
Blessings are on the head of the Righteous, etc. Particularly for the
righteous person himself in this life, it is said, that Psalm. 34. 15.
The eyes of the Lord are upon the Righteous. Pro. 10. 24.
God will grant the desire of the Righteous Psalm. 34. 19.
The Lord delivers the Righteous out of all trouble. ^sal. 27. 25.
The Righteous shall never be forsaken. Psalm 68. 3.
The Righteous shall be glad. Psalm 92. 12.
The Righteous shall flourish like a Palm tree. Pro. 28 1.
The Righteous are hold as a Lion. Pro. 4. 18.
The way of the Righteous shines as the light, etc. For his death, Pro. 14. 32.
The Righteous has hope in his death. Isa. 57. 1.
The Righteous are taken away from the evil to come. After death, Pro. 10. 7.
The memortall of the Righteous shall be blessed. Psalm. 112. 6.
The Righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. At the resurrection,
Mat. 25. 46.
The Righteous shall go into life eternal. Mat. 13. 43.
The Righteous shall shine as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father. For
their posterity, Psalm. 112. 2.
The generation of the Righteous shall be blessed. and 37. 25.
Their seed shall not beg their bread, etc.

Here we see matter enough to answer all the discommodities that may be
objected against Righteousness. Moses having an eye to the recompense of the
reward, Heb. 11. 24. etc.
forsook the honors, pleasures, and riches of Egypt: three such baits as all
the world most greedily snap at. Christ for the joy which was set before him,
endured the cross, and despised the shame. Heb. 12. 2.
Thus if we set the end and issue of Righteousness before us, O quanta
sanctorum virtus! omnia ipsorum sunt venerabilia. Chrys^st. ad pop. hom. (...).
it will make us to let go all earthly matters to hold it fast: for our souls
find much ease through the burden that the flesh feels hereby. In a word,
great is the dignity, and admirable are the privileges of the Righteous.

. 10. Of the Comfort of Righteousness.
OVt of the answer to his first suggestion, 4 Suggest. that righteousness is
nothing worth.
(if the devil prevail by none of the former) he will seek to persuade us
that this Breast Plate of Righteousness can stand us in no steed: because Isa.
64. 6.
All our Righteousness is as a menstruous cloth: all is but Phil. 3. 8.
dung and loss. Thus he beguileth many weak Christians, and often brings
them to utter despair.

Answ. Righteousness acceptable unto God.
For avoiding this, we are to be informed that though our Righteousness,
considered in it self, and compared with the perfect rule of the law, be
exceeding defective; or opposed to the Righteousness of Christ, be dung and
loss; yet as it is a work of Gods holy Spirit in us, proceeding from an heart
purified by faith, all the imperfections thereof being covered with the perfect
Righteousness of Christ, it is acceptable unto God, and such a thing as we may
receive much comfort in. Therefore though our Righteousness in it self,
afford no matter of boasting, yet in regard of Gods gracious acceptance, it
is a thing much to be labored after; yea also to be rejoiced in.

. 11. Of all the parts of Righteousness united.
IF the devil cannot by any means bring us wholly to reject all
Righteousness, 5. Suggest. that partial righteou^nes is sufficient.
he will endeavor to make us careless in some parts thereof, or at least
negligent in taking the present opportunity: as if it were sufficient only in
somethings to be righteous, because Psalm. 103. 3.
God is merciful to forgive us all our defaults: or upon our deathbeds to
turn from our unrighteousness, because Ezekiel. 18. 27.
When the wicked turns away from his wickedness, he shall save his soul
alive. Herewith in all ages he has beguiled many thousands.

Against the first part of this suggestion, Answer. The parts of righteousness
may not be severed.
we are to know that the several parts and branches of Righteousness, are so
firmly and inseparably knit together, that the parts cannot be severed without
the destruction of the whole. For Righteousness is as a chain of many links,
Qui vnam iustitiam fecerit cunctas virtutes implesse dicatur, quae inuice^ se
sequuntur, and sibi haeren: ^ita vt qui vnam habuerit omnes habeat and qui vna
carucrit cunctis careat. Hier. in Isa. 56.
the several links of this chain, are those several duties which the law
requires to be performed to God and man: let any one of the links be taken
away, the chain is broke; if the chain be broken, that which did ha^g by it
must needs fall down. To this purpose says the Apostle. Iam. 2. 10.
Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet fails in one point is guilty of
all. Righteousness is compared to a Job. 29. 14.
garment, as well as to a Breast Plate. A garment must cover us all over: yea
our Righteousness must be like Ioh. 19. 23, 24
Christ's coat that may not be divided: If it be cut in the middle, it cannot
but make us ashamed, as 2 Samuel 10. 4, 5.
David's servants were when their coats were cut.

Object. If this were so, who should be saved? for Iam. 3, 2.
in many things we sin all.

Answ. Indeed all sin in many things: but all sin not after the same manner.
The righteous when they sin, are drawn into sin either through their own
weakness, or through the violence of some temptation: they take not liberty
wittingly and willingly to nourish any sin, or omit any duty: in which
respect they are said 1 Ioh. 3 9.
not to commit sin: and it is noted as a property of the righteous to 2 Kin.
23. 25. Luke 1. 6.
walk in all the Commandments of God. When a righteous man is thus careful
and watchful in avoiding sin, and doing his duty, then will the Lord be
merciful to pardon him his infirmities: but if any wilfully continue in any
sin, what remains but a fearful looking for of judgment?

. 12. Of the danger of deferring repentance.
AGainst the second part of the suggestion, Man cannot when he list repent.
we are to know that although whenever an unrighteous man truly repents,
he shall be pardoned, yet he cannot truly repent whenever he will. He that
refuses to turn when God calls him, provoke God to give him over to the
hardness of his heart. As for such as think to repent at their death, how
know they what warning they shall have of their death? May they not suddenly
be taken away as Dan. 5. 30.
Belshazzar, and Luke 12. 20.
the rich fool? But what if some sickness come before as Deaths haruinger?
Surely there is little hope that such as before have not, should then turn
unto God: For then commonly is the body weak, the spirits faint, the heart
dull, the mind troubled, and the Devil most busy about us: and God has given
no promise to the unrighteous to succor him at that time, but rather Prou. 1.
27. etc.
the contrary.

Objection. Luke 23. 43.
Christ was merciful to a thief at the time of his death.

Answer. 1. That one example of that kind is recorded, that none should utterly
despair: 2. Only that one, that none should presume: 3. It cannot be proved
that purposely he put off his repentance to that day* 4. It is not safe to make
an extraordinary action (as this was) a pattern: for Christ did then
miraculously work on that thief, to give in that moment of his humiliation an
evidence of his divine power.

. 13. Of being ouer-iust.
LAstly, 6. Suggest. That a man may be oueriust.
he beguileth many by suggesting that they may be Eccl. 7. 18.
ouer-iust, and so makes them the less careful in putting on the breast plate
of righteousness.

Answer. Answer.
For avoiding this, know for an undoubted truth, Who are ouer-iust.
that in true righteousness a man cannot be oueriust: that is, too strict in
avoiding any sin, or too conscionable in performing any bounden duty. For
why? Romans 6. 23.
Every sin is mortal. And of every duty an account is to be given: for they
are the Talents which God has committed to our charge.

But for a man to make a righteousness unto himself which is not grounded on
Gods word, Si quem ^ ad omnia fratrum peccata co^spexeris, hunc scito plus esse
iustum, quam iustu^ est. Hi^r.
and therein to be strict, is to be ouer-iust. To count such things to be
sin, which by Gods Law are not made sin, is to be ouer-iust: to be a
busie-body, is to be ouer-iust: to be censorious without just ground, is to be
ouer-iust, etc. But go along by Gods word, which is the rule of
righteousness, hold close to it, and thou can not be ouer-iust.

Thus we see how Gods word is able to make us wise against all the wiles of
the Devil. Let our care be to make good use of that wisdom.

. 14. A direction for the use of Righteousness.
1. Learn we what is true Righteousness, that we trust not to a counterfeit
breast plate, and be pierced through while we think our selves safe.

2 Acquaint we our selves with the use, end, beauty, benefit, and necessity of
Righteousness, that we may be the more desirous to get it if we have it not:
or if we have it, the more careful in keeping it fast on, and close to us.

3 Let a daily examination be made of our life past, that of all our former
unrighteousness we may truly and soundly repent: and with the true evidences
of our former righteousness, our consciences may be comforted in the day of
trial. Acts 23. 1. and 24. 16.
The Apostle comforted himself in the midst of his troubles with the
testimony of his good conscience. Heb. 13. 18.


4 Let there be an holy resolution for the time to come to walk on in the way
of righteousness, Deuteronomy. 5. 32.
without turning to the right hand or to the left. Behold Psa. 119. 106
David's resolution, and Phi. 3. 13, 1^
Paul's practice.

For the better performance of this most holy resolution,

1 Put on Righteousness with all the parts thereof.

2 Remove all impediments at the first, and give no place to the Devil.

3 Wax not weary, but be constant.

THE FIFTH PART.
Shoes of the preparation of the Gospel of Peace.
Ephesians. 6. 15. And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
peace.
. 1. Of the Grace here meant.
THe third piece of Spiritual Armor is not so plainly and distinctly laid
down as the former. It will be needful 1. To search out what is that
particular grace which is her^ meant. 2. How fitly it is compared to that part
of harness which is here implied. 3. How the grace here meant is gotten. 4.
How needful and profitable it is. 5. How it has her perfect work. 6. What
are the extremes contrary to it. 7. What wiles the Devil uses to deprive us
of it.

1. Because the phrase which the Apostle uses is somewhat doubtful and
ambiguous, there are many discrepant opinions about that which is meant thereby.

Among those many, there are two which come nearest to the point, and are
implied under the description of this grace, though neither of them (as I take
it) be the grace it self. One is Knowledge of the Gospel, the other is Peace
of Conscience. The former is implied under this word Gospel, (for without
knowledge of the Gospel the soul cannot be settled. The Gospel unto him which
knows it not, is no Gospel, of no use at all.) The other is implied under this
word Peace, whereby is meant that Peace of Conscience, which by the knowledge
of the Gospel is wrought in us. But the Preparation here spoken of, is another
grace distinct from both these; even an effect which follows from them both.
Wherefore as the causes of a thing are not the thing it self, so neither of
those graces severally considered in it self, is the distinct piece of Armor
here meant. The Syriach Translator well clears the meaning of the Apostle,
who thus turns it; Calceate in pedibus vestris praeparationem Euangelij
pacis. T^em. interp.
Put as shoes on your feet the preparation of the Gospel of Peace. Under
this word Preparation then (according to the literal and Grammatical
construction, which is the best and surest) is the grace it self comprised:
for it implies a furniture which the Gospel of Peace procures and prepares:
or an heart settled, resolved, and prepared by the Gospel of Peace, to go on
to God through all difficulties. Now the very grace it self which thus setleth
the soul, I take to be Patience: for it is without all doubt, the drift

1. Some take the preparation of the Gospel to be a readiness to preach the
Gospel, thinking that the Apostle alludeth to that prophecy of Jsaiah; How
beautiful are the feet of him that declares peace. Isa. 52. 7.

Answ. Thus this piece of armor should appertain only to Ministers,

whereas it is clear that the Apostle prescribes the whole Armor to all
Christians.

2. Other, to be a promptness to profess the Gospel, agreeable to Saint
Peter's counsel, Be ready (or prepared) to give an answer; etc. 1. Pet. 3. 15.

Answer. This promptness and readiness, is rather an effect of the grace here
meant, then the grace it self, as we shall after hear.

3. Other, to be an Evangelical obedience.

Answer. Thus would it be confounded with the former grace. For Righteousness
is an obedience to Gods word.

4. Other, to be the Gospel it self, alluding to that of David, Thy word is
a lamp unto my feet. Psalm. 119. 105.

Answer. The phrase which the Apostle here uses, shows that not so much the
Gospel it self, as something wrought thereby, is here meant.

and scope of the Apostle, In horum calce^mentorum fig^^ am* and illa
calceamenta in Exodo praecesserunt, quae habere ^ascha vescentibus imperatur,
and his qui ad faciendumpiter pacati sunt. Signu^ s^quidem praeparationis est,
calceatis pedibus comedere, vt corroborati paschali cibo, satam and horribilem
possint eremum pertransire. Hier. in hunc locum.
to arm the Christian soldier against trouble and affliction, by this
particular piece of spiritual Armor here meant: but what grace so fit
thereunto as patience? This was it wherewith Job, to use Christ's phrase ( Luke
21. 19.) did even possess his soul. And this is it which Saint James
prescribes as a means to arm us against trouble, Iam. 1. 3, 4, etc. For
patience is a gift of God, whereby we are enabled to bear those crosses which
God lays upon us. Many were the troubles which the Christian Hebrews endured
for profession of the Gospel: to enable them to endure all those troubles, the
Apostle says; Heb. 10. 36.
They had need of patience. Under this word Patience I comprise all those first
graces of the Spirit, whereby the Gospel teaches that men are prepared to go
with Christ into the field; as the denial of ones self, that taking up of
ones cross, with resolution to follow Christ. It is here called (...).
a preparation, because by it a man is fitted, prepared, and made ready to go
on in his course, notwithstanding all dangers and distresses whatsoever meet
with him in the way to hinder him. It is said to be the preparation of the
Gospel, because it is the Gospel which teaches it, and is the cause thereof:
nothing but the Gospel can prepare a man's heart against trouble. Lastly, this
epithete Peace, is added to show what the Gospel brings unto us, and works
in us, namely, peace to God, as we shall after more fully hear. To conclude
this first point, in brief note, that it is the knowledge of the glad tidings
of reconciliation, which pacify^ng our conscience, prepares our hearts, and
works in them true sound Christian patience, whereby we are ready to march on
in our course against all annoyances.

. 2. Of the resemblance of Patience to shoes.
How fit the Apost^es metaphor is.
is that whereby a soldiers feet or legs are covered: for (...).
feet are here expressed, and the metaphor of (...).
being shod, implies as much. By feet he means legs also: the pieces of
armor that are proper to this purpose, are called greaues, or leg-harnesse,
they are also called soldiers shoes, and boots. The metaphor may either be
generally taken of all shoes, or particularly of greaues. For the general,
we all know that the use of shoes is to keep our feet from sharp stones,
hard clods, with the like: for our feet are naturally tender, insomuch that if
we go abroad barefoot, every hard stone hurts them, every sharp stick and
pricking thorn pierces them: therefore we use not to venture abroad
bare^foote: If any be so foole-hardy as to venture, soon will he wax weary,
and either sit down and go no further, or else turn back again. But if we
have good boots or shoes on, then we think our selves well fenced, and so
with boldness and courage go on, whatsoever the way be.

To apply this. Application of the metaphor.
Stones, sticks, thorns, and the like, are not more grievous to our bare
feet, then troubles, crosses, and afflictions are to our naked heart and
soul. Now then this world through which we must pass to Heaven, being a very
hard and rough way, stony and thorny, full of all sorts of afflictions; if our
souls be naked and bare, not fenced with patience, and so fitted and prepared
well to endure all crosses, we shall either never venture to enter into this
hard way, or at least not endure to hold out therein. But if our souls be
thoroughly possessed with sound and true patience, then shall we with undaunted
courage, pass through all the troubles of this World.

For the particular (which is the rather to be considered, The use of greaues
in war.
because the Apostles whole direction is taken from war) the use of greaues
and leg-harnesse, were to keep the legs and feet from hurts and wounds,
because if they were wounded or broken, a man could no longer stand, but was
overthrown. Such soldiers as stand in the front of the battle, or single
themselves out alone as 1 Samuel 17. 6
Goliath, most commonly have their legs fenced with these. Besides, it being a
stratagem which enemies often use, Caes. Comment.
to stick the way by which they know that the adverse parties must needs
pass, with short stubs and pikes, ends of spears, and such like, of purpose
to gall their feet and legs, and make them weary of going on; soldiers use to
wear boots, and greaues, to prevent such mischiefs. Surely the Devil uses
such a stratagem against Christian soldiers: for knowing in what way they are
to walk to Heaven, he sets many pricks and crosses therein, as reproaches,
disgraces, troubles, vexations, persecutions, by loss of goods, liberties, and
lives; yea, many times grievous torments and tortures: now if our souls be not
fenced with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace, what hope, yea, what
possibility is there of going on, and holding out in that way?

. 3. Of the ground of Patience.
Preparation, how patience is gotten.
this fence and furniture of the soul, namely patience may be gotten, even by
the Gospel of Peace: for it is such a preparation as the Gospel of peace
teaches and works, whence it follows, that the Gospel of Peace, is the
only true ground of this piece of Armor.

For the better clearing of this point, I will distinctly show,

1 What the Gospel is.

2 What Peace is here meant.

3 Why Peace is thus attributed to the Gospel.

4 How the Gospel of Peace effects this preparation.

. 4. Of the Gospel.
GOspel, 1 What the Gospel is.
according to the proper notation of the (...).
original word, signifies a good message, or glad tidings: so it is sometimes
translated, as Romans 10. 15. How beautiful are the feet of them which (...).
bring glad tidings? etc. The same notation may our English word Gospel admit:
for spell in ancient time signified speech: Gospel then is a good speech. Lat
Fren. ^tal. Span. etc
The most elegant and learned languages retain the Greek word.

The good and glad tidings which this word implies, is, that Christ Jesus the
Son of God, is given unto the sons of men. An Luke 2. 10, 11.
Angel from heaven thus expounded this word; for having said, (...).
I bring you gla^ tidings, he adds, that unto you is borne a Savior which is
Christ the Lord. Therefore the Histories which purposely write of Christ Jesus,
declaring his Diety and humanity, his conception and birth, his life and death,
words and deeds, humiliation and exaltation, etc. are by an excellency and
propriety termed Gospels, or to speak as the Scots do, Euangiles, and the
penne-men of them Evangelists. If it be duly considered into what a woe-full
estate man by sin had implunged himself, how no creature in Heaven or earth
was able to succor him, what full redemption Christ has wrought and unto how
excellent an estate he has redeemed us, Euangelium est mare in qu^ diuinae
gratiae plenitudo est. Amb. Hexam. lib. 5. cap. 7.
it will appear, that never the like glad tidings was or could be brought to
mankind then this, that Christ a Savior was given unto them; so that this
message may well be called a Gospel or Euangile. In it is the very fullness of
Gods favor manifested.

. 5. Of that Peace which the Gospel causes.
THe Peace here spoken of, 2 What peace is here meant
is our reconciliation with God. In the beginning God made man after his own
Image, by virtue whereof, there was a sweet harmony and concord betwixt God and
man; God having revealed unto man what was his good will, pleasing and
acceptable unto him; man being both able, and also willing to do that which
was acceptable to God. But long this Peace did not last: it was soon broken,
and that wholly, and only through man's default. For man wittingly sinned
against his Creator, and thereby justly provoked his wrath: thus came enmity
betwixt God and man. Such a breach was made by man's rebellion, that all
creatures in Heaven and earth were not able to make it up. Christ therefore,
the eternal, true, natural, proper, only begotten Son of God, took upon
him to be a Mediator betwixt God and man. He satisfied his Fathers Justice,
pacified his wrath, procured his favor toward man, whereby God was moved to
offer reconciliation unto man; Deus appellatur pacis quia per Christum ei
reconciliati sumus, qui est pax nostra, Hieron. Hedib. quaest. 12.
withal he gave unto man his sanctifiing Spirit, to breed faith in him, that
thereby man might receive and embrace this reconciliation. In this respect God
is called the God of Peace ( Romans 16. 20.) and Christ our Peace, ( chap. 2.
14.) Prince of Peace ( Isa. 9. 6.) And God is said in Christ to reconcile the
world unto himself, (2 Cor. 5. 19.) Thus through the mediation of Christ, God
offering, and man accepting reconciliation, a most perfect and inviolable peace
is made betwixt them, and this is the peace here meant. As fruits of this peace
there flow from it remission of sins, quietness and comfort of conscience,
joy of heart, willingness and ability to do that which is pleasing unto God,
freedom from the dominion of sin, from the power of the Devil, from the
evil of all crosses, from the sting of death, and of the grave, and from the
fear and fire of Hell.

. 6. Why it is called the Gospel of Peace.
THis Peace is so appropriated to the Gospel, 3 How Peace is appropriated to
the Gospel.
that it is called the Gospel of Peace, and that in a double respect, First, of
the matter. Secondly, of the effect.

1 The subject matter of this glad tidings, is the forenamed Peace and
reconciliation betwixt God and man. The Gospel first declared, and still
continues to publish the same: neither the Law, nor any humane writings can
do this: therefore so soon as Luke 2. 10, 11
one Angel had declared this glad tidings, an whole troop of heavenly
soldiers cried out 14.
Peace on earth. It was the Gospel which declared peace to Genesis 3. 15.
Adam, and 7. 1.
Noah, and 12. 3.
Abram, and the rest of the Saints in all ages, before and since Christ's time.
Isa. 52. 7.
They therefore which preach the Gospel, are said to publish Peace.

2 It is a powerful effect of this Gospel, to work Peace in them that hear
it, and believe it. For Gal. 3. 2.
in and by the Ministry of the Gospel, the Spirit of Christ is conveyed into
our hearts: in which respect it is called 2 Cor. 3. 8.
the ministration of the Spirit. This Spirit first moves us to embrace
reconciliation offered in the Gospel, and then it quieteth our conscience, and
so works Peace therein.

How admirably does this commend unto us the love of God, Use 1. Gods love.
and of his Son our Savior? he thought it not enough, that at first he made
al in peace, though he might justly have rejected man for ever, as he did the
Devils, because man willingly and rebelliously broake this Peace; yet to
magnify his mercy toward man, he spared not his Son, but gave him to be our
Peace, who, (to use the Scripture phrase) Cha. 2. v. 16.
slew hatred, and made Peace: yea not so only, but also gave his Gospel,
thereby making open proclamation of Peace, and inuiting men to embrace it.
Excellently is this set forth in the Mat. 22. 2. etc.
parable of the Kings sons wedding; Luke 14. 16. etc.
if we do as they who were invited thereunto, how justly do we deserve to be
deprived of this Peace?

What a blessing is it to have the Gospel preached among us: Use 2. A blessing
to have the Gospel.
the Gospel of Peace, such a Phil. 4. 7.
Peace as passes understanding? Is it not an heavy curse to want this Gospel?
this should be a strong motive to stir up Ministers, diligently and
faithfully to preach the Gospel, and to stir up people earnestly to give heed
and credence thereunto, even as they tender their Peace.

. 7. Of the ground of true Patience.
FRom that which has been delivered of the Gospel of Peace, 4 The Gospel of
peace prepares a man's heart against trouble.
that maine point which we have in hand, by necessary consequence follows,
that the only means of preparing our souls patiently to bear all crosses,
and constantly to go through all troubles in our Christian course, is a right
knowledge of the glad tidings of our reconciliation with God. Genesis 12. 2, 3,
It was this Gospel of Peace wherewith God encouraged Abraham to come out of
his own country, and with a patient and prepared heart to pass over all
these difficulties whereunto he should be brought. This was that glad tidings
which the Lord brought to Exodus 3. 6, 7
Moses, to Ios. 1. 5.
Joshua, to Iud. 6. 12.
Gedeon, and many others for that very end. I might instance this in many
thousand examples, and show how the courage and patience of the Saints, which
has been admirable to the world, has been grounded on this sure foundation
the Gospel of Peace. For the truth is, that all the Prophets all the Apostles,
all the true Christian confessors, and Martyrs in all ages, who have endured
more then flesh and blood could possibly with patience bear, have had their
feet shod, that is, their hearts armed and prepared with assurance of their
reconciliation with God: but having such a cloud of witnesses, I will content
my self with naming two or three.

Many and sundry were the troubles, inward and outward, by open enemies, and
deceitful friends, on Sea and land, which Saint Paul went through, and that
with an invincible courage and resolution: the cause of all is evident to be
that Romans 8 31, 32, etc.
knowledge which he had of Gods love to him, and of his reconciliation with
God. On this ground of confidence he did after an holy manner insult over all
adverse power. Iam. 5. 11.
But Job yet suffered much more, and his patience was so admirable, that the
holy Ghost makes choice of him above all other, as a mark to behold, and a
pattern to follow. What was the ground of his patience? surely many of those
divine speeches which he uttered to his wife and friends, evidently show, that
the knowledge of his reconciliation with God, was it which made him so
confident and patient. There is yet another who far exceeded these and all
other Saints both in suffering and patient bearing, namely Christ: the
assurance of his Fathers love was the ground of his patience, as appears both
by that Ioh 17. 24.
profession which he made thereof, a little before his suffering (saying unto
his Father, Thou louedst me before the foundation of the world,) and also by
those titles which in his most bitter agony he gave unto God, as in the Garden*
Mat. 26. 39.
O my Father, etc. On the Cross, Mat. 27. 46.
My God, my God.

. 8. Of the means whereby Patience is wrought.
THus we see the truth of this point sufficiently proved; The Gospel prepares
our hearts by declaring.
that the Gospel of Peace, is the ground of Patience: now further consider how
it does prepare the soul of man to endure. This it does by persuading man's
mind, and resolving his heart of these two principles.

1 That nothing shall hurt him.

2 That all things shall turn to his good.

For the first, 1 That nothing can hurt us.
most sure it is that nothing can make us miserable, but only sin: Sin is
the very sting of all troubles aed crosses: sin is it which makes them to be
heavy burdens: this makes trouble of conscience to be intolerable: death and
the grave to be most terrible: the devil which has the power of death to be
so horrible: yea, the Law of God, and God himself to be so full of dread and
terror. Let sin be removed, and our conscience assured thereof; then may we,
then will we comfort our selves in all troubles: for then shall we appear
before the Throne of God, as before the mercy-seat of a gracious Father, and
take his Law, as a direction to teach us how to please him. Then shall we
esteem all crosses as corrections of the Lord for our profit, yea, as his
physic to purge out our corruptions, and as proofs of his graces in us. Then
will our conscience rest quiet and well contented: then shall we think of
death, as of a gate to heaven, and of the grave, as of a sweet bed to rest in,
till the day of the consummation of our eternal bliss in body and soul: yea,
then shall we not need to fear the devil, because he can have no power over
us, much less hell and the torment thereof. Therefore does Psalm. 32. 1, 2
David annexe blessedness to remission of sin: so that Mat. 9. 2.
upon this ground might Christ well say to the man sick of the palsy, Son,
be of good comfort.

This being so, the Gospel of Peace which assures us of our reconciliation
with God, and of the remission of our sin, assures us also that nothing can
hurt us, because the sting of every thing, which is sin, is pulled out. If
the forked tongue of an adder, the poisonous teeth of a snake, the sharp sting
of a waspe be pulled out, what hurt can they do?

For the second, 2 That all things shall make to our good.
by the Gospelc We know that all things work together for good, unto them that
love God. For the Gospel assuring us of reconciliation with God, how can we but
be assured that he tendereth us as his children, and with a fatherly affection
seeks our good in all things which by his good providence he brings upon
us. Psalm. 112.
The prosperity of those with whom God is reconciled is a blessing: and 119. 71.
afflictions are for their good: so is Reu. 14. 23.
death and the grave: Mir^ quodam modo etiam ipsum peccatum iufto in iustitia^
cooperatur. Ber. in Psalm. 91. sermon. 2.
yea, I may truly say that the sins of those who are accepted of God, do turn
to their good: not that sin is any way good in it self, being in it self
the greatest evil that is or can be, and the cause of all evil of punishment;
but that God through his infinite power and wisdom (who can bring good out of
evil, ^s at first he caused light to shine out of darkness) does so order
it: like unto a skillful Apothecary, who can so order and temper rank poison,
as it shall prove very medicinable.

Quest. What is that good can come from sin?

Answ. 1 In regard of Exodus 32. 3^ and 34. 6, 7.
God, whose mercy and grace is manifested and magnified in forgiving sin: for
Romans 5 20.
Where sin abounded, there did grace much more abound.

2 In regard of sinners, Nonne coope ratur nobis ille casus in bonu^ vnde and
humiliores efficimur and cautiores? Bern. ibid.
(I mean repentant sinners, for of their sins I speak) it works in them
godly sorrow (a sorrow not to be repented of, because of the excellent fruits
thereof* noted 2. Cor. 7. 10, 11.) It works also an high esteem of Gods free
grace and rich mercy, a longing desire after Christ's righteousness, a diligent
watchfulnes our our selves for the time to come, a Christian readiness to
bear with the slips and infirmities of other, with the like.

These are two such grounds of Patience, as all the writings of all the men in
the world cannot afford the like* It is the Gospel, and the Gospel alone,
which has made them known, and not only so, but also instrumentally works
faith in our hearts: whereby we give credence unto the truth of them, and with
strong confidence, rest and stay our selves thereupon.

. 9. Of the false grounds of Patience.
HEnce learn, Use 1. Counterfeit patience.
that all the pretended patience of heathen men, and others which knew not this
Gospel of Peace, was but a mere shadow of patience: for what were the grounds
thereof? surely no much matter^ as by the Gospel is revealed, but such as man's
natural^ reason invented, as these,

1 It is no part of manhood, but mere childishness and cowardlinesse to be
impatient.

2 Sorrow, mourning, all impatiency, and the like, may much aggrauate our
troubles, but can no way ease them or take them away.

3 Others are subject to troubles: it is a common condition of mankind.

4 There is an inevitable necessity, or (to use the words and phrase) a fatal
destiny, they cannot be avoided.

5 They are not for ever to endure, but will have an end, if by no other
means, yet by death. These and such like may make men bold and hardy, or
stupid and blockish. I may resemble them to Opium, and such like medicines
which stupifie men's senses, and make them the less impatiently bear their
pains, but they bring no true ease.

The Gospel of peace breeds not a sencelesnesse, but Romans 5. 3.
such a patience as is seasoned with comfort and joy.

. 10. Of the manner of working true Patience.
AS we desire true patience, Use 2. How patience may be rightly grounded in us.
so labor we that it be rightly grounded in us. For this end we must
acquaint our selves with this Gospel of peace, and labor for true, saving,
sanctifying knowledge thereof: for the attaining whereunto,

1 The promises of God in his word are to be observed, especially such as
concern our reconciliation with God, and his favor toward us; as Psa. 119.
49. 50.
David did. Without knowledge of Gods promise there can be no sound confidence:
all the show that we may seem to make thereof will prove but mere presumption.

2 The cause of those promises is to be well noted, which is GODS free grace
and mere mercy.

3 The parties to whom they are made, are to be marked, All that shall believe.

4 The properties of such as believe, are also to be noted. Of these we shall
speak on verse 16.

When we come to any that are sick, Use 3. How men may be persuaded unto true
patience
or in any other distress, and desire to persuade them unto true patience; we
must bring them to knowledge of the Gospel of peace, that they having
assurance thereof, may be the more quiet under Gods correcting hand: bring
them to believe that their sins are forgiven, and then may thou well bid
them Mat. 9. 2
Be of good comfort, and patient.

. 11. Of the necessity of true Patience.
The necessity of patience.
is the necessity of this piece of Spiritual Armor. Though it be compared to
legge-harnesse, which may seem to be least necessary, Simil.
yet indeed it is no whit less necessary then any of the rest: we know that if
a man be not well fenced on his legs, he may receive such a blow upon them,
as will clean overthrow him, notwithstanding the other pieces of armor? but
if the way be rough and thorny, and the man barefooted and bare-legged, and in
that respect dares not march on, what benefit reapes he by the furniture of
the other parts? To let the metaphor pass; the gift and grace it self which
now we speak of, Patience, is so absolutely necessary, as without it there
can be no hope of attaining to victory, glory, and rest, where Christ our
chief Captain is. Heb. 10. 36.
The Apostle expressly says, that patience is needful: to show that he
speaks of an absolute necessity, he implies that the promise (meaning
eternal life promised) cannot be received without it: for he had showed V. 6.
12.
before, that the Saints in former times through faith and patience inherited
the promise, and in that respect both that Apostle, and also Iam. 5. 10.
Saint James exhort Christians to follow them.

. 12. Of the troubles whereunto we are subject.
MAny troubles and crosses must be undergone in this World, Reason. Many
troubles to be undergone.
before we can come to enjoy rest and happiness in Heaven. Note Ioh. 16. 33.
Luke 14. 27. Acts 14. 22. 2 Timothy 3. 12. Heb. 12. 6, 7. These places show how
rough, and full of pricks the way to Heaven is.

Experience of all ages does verify the truth of those Scriptures: Quis
Sanctorum sine certamine coronatus est? Abel iustus occiditur, etc. quaere and
inuenies singulos aduersa perpessos. Hier. ad Eustoch.
consider the Histories of Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, their posterity
in Egypt, in the Wilderness, in Canaan; under Judges, under Kings, and in
their captiuities: consider the lives of Christ, of the Prophets, Apostles, and
other Saints; the estate of Christ's Church in the Apostles time, after their
time, and ever since even unto these our days: it were infinite to reckon up
all the persecutions, troubles, afflictions, and sundry kinds of crosses which
Gods people from time to time have been brought unto. In a word, it is as
possible for sheep to ^iue quiet among wolves without hurt, as for the Church
in this world without trouble and persecution.

Object. All ages and times have not been times of persecution: The Church in
Solomon's days, and under the reign of many other good Kings had great peace
and quiet: yea, it is written that in the Apostles times, (which were most
troublesome times) Acts 9. 31.
the Churches had rest: so in Constantines times, and in the time of other good
Christian Emperors: likewise here in this Land under the reign of King Edward
the sixth, Queen Elizabeth, and King James, who now lives.

Answ. Troubles in most peacable times.
Though the Church and children of God be somewhile, for a time freed from
outward public persecutions of the Magistrate, or from open invasions of the
enemy, yet not from all manner of troubles. Many are the troubles of the
righteous, even in the most halcion and peaceable days that ever were. For in
the bosom of the Church (while the Church remains on Earth) there have been
always, still are, and ever will be some borne after the flesh, as well as
some borne after the spirit, which being so, Gal. 4. 29.
persecution there will be, if not with fire and sword, banishment and
imprisonment, outward torture and torment; yet with that which goes as near
to the heart, and pierces thorwo the soul as deeply, namely, ignominy,
reproach, disgrace, and such like Genesis 21. 9.
Ismaeticall persecution.

In the most quiet times of the Church, Isa. 59. 15.
He that refraineth from evil makes himself a prey. Manifold iniubies do
the true Saints receive of their wicked neighbors; they are disgraced and
oppressed of the greater sort, reviled and wronged of the meaner sort: if they
should have peace abroad, yet Mat. 10. 35. 36.
at home, even in their Families shall they find troubles enough, arising from
their Parents, Husbands, or Wives, Children, Servants, Friends, Kindred, and the
like. We read of, hear and see the crosses of others: every one feels his
own, and so best knows them. Show me the man (let it be he that has seemed
to himself and others the most happy) that in truth can say; his life has
been every way so free from all troubles and crosses, that in his own
experience he knows no^ what they mean: If any should so say, I might more
truly say to his face, that either he is of a most stupid, blockish, and
senseless disposition; or else that plainly he lies. But suppose for the
time, that it were possible for a man to be freed from all outward troubles,
has he none within? Is all quiet in his soul and conscience? Had he never any
grief of mind, anguish of spirit, vexation of heart, trouble of conscience?
then never had he any sin, or at least never any sense and feeling of sin.

. 13. Of the Authors of our troubles.
THis is thus brought to pass, partly by the good guiding providence of God,
and partly by the malice of the Devil: God both aiming at, and also bringing
forth good thereby: the Devil aiming at evil, but crossed in his purpose.

That troubles and crosses fall not on us without God, Troubles fall not out
without God.
is evident by many express testimonies of Scripture, as Isa 45. 7. The good
which comm^th from troubles.
Amo. 3. 6. Job 1. 21. 2 Samuel 16. 11. Eze. 20. 3^. Heb. 12. 6, 7. The good
which God aims at, and effects by those troubles he inflicteth on his
children, is manifold: as,

1 2 Cor. 12. 7.
The preventing of some great mischief and evil

2 2 Chr. 3^ 12
The purging out of some festering poysonsome sin. Luk 5. 17.


3 Heb. 12. 10. 11.
The upholding and keeping us safe and steadfast in the right way.

4 1 Pet. 4. 1^.
The proof and trial of such gifts and graces as he has bestowed on his
children.

That the Devil also has his hand in afflicting Gods children, Satan has his
hand in afflicting S^ints.
is clear by these (among many other) Scriptures, Job 1. 9. 10. and 2. 5. 1
Chro 21. 1. Zac. 3. 1. Luke 22. 31.

2 Cor. 12. 7. Re^el. 2. 10. That which the Devil aims at herein, is to Job.
1. 10.
discourage us, and to turn us out of the right way, 1 These. 2. 18
to hinder the progress of the Gospel, and in a word 1 Pet. 5. 8.
to devour us. The Devil well knows how weak and feeble our nature is, how
soon our flesh is quailed, how irksome troubles are to us by nature: this way
therefore he labors by all the means he can, secretly and openly, by
himself, and instruments to annoy us.

. 14. Of the necessity of Patience.
THe point then being so clear, T^lerantia molestiarum omnibusc in ha^ vita
subeunda est, tendentibus ad arborem vitae. Aug. de Genesis l. 2.
that of necessity many troubles must be passed through, before we come to our
heavenly rest, it necessarily follows, that of necessity we must be shod and
fenced with patience. The want of this grace has been the cause that many,
who for a while have made an hot onset in the Christian battle, at length
(when they felt the hard and rough way wherein they marched, and when they
found themselves galled and pricked with the troubles which they have met
withal) have fallen away, and refused to go on any further in their Christian
course: 2 Timothy 4. 16.
as they which forsook Saint Paul.

. 15. Of the benefit of Patience.
AS this grace is necessary, so also is the benefit thereof exceeding great:
for if we be well shod therewith, no trouble will dismay us, or hinder us in
our Christian course: it makes such burdens as seem very heavy to flesh and
blood, to be but light and easy to be borne; and such things tolerable, which
natural men think intolerable, and unsupportable; yea, it keeps us from
being foiled and overcome. Iam. 5. ^0.
This made Job pass over such grievous assaults as never any, that we read
of, ever endured the like.

When the holy Ghost speaks of the victory which the Sainis have gotten, he
says; Reu. 13. 10. and 14. 12.
Here is the patience of the Saints, implying, that through their patience they
overcame all their troubles.

. 16: Of the perfect work of Patience.
James ( Chap. 1. verse 5.) is worthy to be noted; it is this, How patience
has her perfect work.
Let patience have her perfect work. The work of patience is said to be
perfect in respect, First, of the condition. Secondly of the extent. Thirdly of
the continuance.

1 For the condition it must be true, 1 It must be sound.
hearty and sound, not fained and counterfeit. As integrity and uprightness is
a kind of perfection in all Christian graces, so also in patience.

2 For the extent it must reach to all manner of crosses, 2 It must reach to
all crosses.
heavy and light, inward and outward, home and abroad, whether they come from
the Devil, or any of his wicked instruments; or from God himself, and his
own hand, of what kind, quality, quantity soever they be: in this respect,
said the Apostle; 2 Cor. 6. 4
We approve our selves in much patience.

3 For the continuance, 3 It must endure to the end.
it must endure unto the end, so much does the (...).
notation of the word, which the Apostle uses, imply. To the end I say, not
only of that present affliction which lies upon us, but also to the end of
our life: so as we must both patiently bear the present, and also prepare our
selves for future crosses. In this respect Christ ^aith; (...).
He that has patience to the end shall be saved. Mat. 10. 2^. Jobs patience


Among other Saints, Jobs patience had her perfect wo^ke in all these respects:
Had it not been upright and sound, he could not have so stood against his
friends, who suspecting his uprightness, thoroughly sifted him. The many trials
whereunto he was brought, and his patient enduring all (for he was overcome by
none) manifests the extent of his patience: never any (Christ excepted)
endured more, never any (the same excepted) more patiently endured all. The
History it self, Job. 13. 15.
his own testimony, and and 42, 7.
Gods also, and the Iam. 5. 11. The necessity of the perfect woike of patience.
witness of his Apostle, do all verify the continuance of his patience to
the end.

. 17. Of the kinds of crosses.
THat we may the better apply this Apostolical direction, as before in
general we showed the necessity of patience, so here in particular we will
show how necessary it is that patience have this perfect work.

This will appear by the kinds of crosses whereunto we are subject.

1 They are not scar-crowes, troubles in show and appearance only, but such as
pierce both body and soul, and make the stourest to stoop and shrink.
Therefore counterfeite patience will stand us in no steed.

2 The number of trials whereunto we shall be brought, is uncertain: one
calamity upon another (as waves) may fall upon us: Job. 1. 16, 17. 18.
that which is written of Job, how one messenger followed another, all bringing
doleful news, shows what may befall any of us. Now suppose we should as
patiently bear some, as Job, but yet taint under the burden of others; where
is the benefit of that former patience? Some that have endured imprisonment,
banishment, and such like trials, yea who have been ready to endure sword and
fire in time of persecution, have been discouraged and turned out of their
good course by reproach, and disgrace, in time of peace: other that can
patiently pass over public troubles, are so disquieted with private losses,
and crosses at home in their families, that they are made unfit to perform any
Christian duty to God, or man. Other that can well endure pain of body,
sickness and such like crosses, cannot bear vexation of mind, or disturbance
of their passion.

3 It is also uncertain how long we shall be subject to trials, because the
continuance of our life is uncertain. This world is the field of the Lords
battle, so long as we are in the field, the enemies will assault us: now to
yield before the battle be ended, is worse then never to have endured any at
all: the glory of all our former patience is not only lost, but also turned
into shame and ignominy, and Heb. 10. 38.
God provoked utterly to give us over.

This last point is the rather to be regarded, because most fail therein: for
many can endure an heavy burden, and a sore brunt for a while, but if long it
lie upon them, then they faint. This was it wherein the Hebrews failed, Heb.
10. 35. and 12. 3.
for the redressing whereof, the Apostle is very earnest.

. 18. Of too light regard of Crosses.
TWo extremes (whereunto we are very prone to run, VI Point two ^xtreams
con^^^ry to patience.
the Preacher, and which much hinder this perfect work of patience) are noted
by Pro. 3. 11.
and by Heb. 12. 5.
the A^postle: one is, too light regard, the other is, too great fear of such
crosses as God lays on men: for some despise them, as matters not much to be
regarded (so much the notation of the original (...).
words imply:) other faint and sink under the burden of them, as if they were
unsupportable, not to be endured (so much also the notation of the (...).
other original words imply:) They look not to God who smites: these fix
their eyes too fast upon his Justice and wrath. It is commonly stupidity of
mind, or stubbornness of will, that makes men fall into the former. Sunt
nonnulli qui molestiam quidem sustinent, caeterum fructu priuantur Ch^ys. de
Laz. con. 3.
They, who are by nature stupide and blockish, have not a spiritual sense of
crosses, but are like to men dead drunk, ( Pro. 23. 33.) they endure many
troubles, but receive no good by any trouble. Such were those Israelites of
whom I^r 53.
Jeremiah complains: and Exodus 5 2.
Pharaoh was such an one. They who are of a stubborn disposition, despise Gods
corrections, as Pro. 27. 22.
the fool whose foolishness will not depart from him, though thou should
bray him in a mortar, etc. Such were those Israelites of whom Isa. 1. 5
Isaiah complains: and 2. Chr. 28. 22.
Ahaz was such an one* These are two dangerous rocks, at which many suffer
shipwreck: two such stumbling blocks, as cause many to fall, and pitch into
hell. Yet Stoics.
many count the first of these, (namely, so to stand out all crosses, as not to
be moved therewith) a virtue: answerable to this heathenish opinion is the
practice of many, who profess themselves to be Christians. Let public
judgments fall on the land where they live, as famine, plague, sword, etc. or
on cities and towns in that land, as inundations of waters, fires, sicknesses,
etc. or on their own houses, their wives, and children: are little moved, no
though it fall upon their own pates. If they may be freed from them, or
delivered out of them, they think it well: if not, they think it destiny,
they must bear it, and so like beasts, or rather like blocks lie under their
burden: thus many lie on their death beds, without remorse, like 1 Samuel 25. 37.
Naball, whose heart dyed within him, and he was like a stone.

. 19. Of despising Gods corrections.
THe other sort, that through a rebellious will, despise Gods corrections, are
the worser sort: they provoke God to show himself a God of vengeance, even a
consuming fire: for Psalm. 18. 26.
With the froward, he will show himself froward. Read what God threatens, (
Leu 26. 18, 21, 24, 28.) and how he executed those threats ( Amo. 4. 6. etc.)
That in these our days, men carry themselves stoutly against God, is too
evident, both by Gods dealings and men's. For God is very merciful, slow to
anger. What is the cause then that he has of late sent so may judgments one
after another unto this land? we may truly say with Jeremiah unto God, Lam.
3. 12.
We have sinned and rebelled, therefore thou have not spared. For man, who is
bettered by the Lords correcting hand? what sin is left? oh beloved, let us
take heed we provoke not God to lay his tod aside, and to take up a staff, or
if that make us not stoop, to vnsheath his sword, and clean cut us off,

. 20. Of fainting under the Cross.
THis extreme the wickeder sortfall into, into the other fall the weaker sort,
but the better, yea many the dear Saints of God. Psalm. 6. 6.
David seems, by his own confession, to have fainted in his mourning: for
such is the feebleness of our nature, such our forgetfulness of Gods power
and promises, that we often let go from us those stays and props, which the Lord
has afforded unto us, to uphold. The Apostle implies, that even Gods
children, without great watchfulness, and continual observation, are very
ready to wax faint. Experience, as of all other times, so of ours also, does
verify as much. For how is it that there should be such slackenesse in many,
who have been heretofore very forward and zealous, and that men's after
proceedings should be so unlike to their former good beginnings, but that they
faint by reason of that hard way, and those manifold troubles, by which we
must pass unto heaven? Great is the danger and damage of this fainting: it
makes men weary of well doing, it causes them to repent of the good which is
done, and to turn back into an easier course (as they suppose) and so to lose
all the glory of that good which has been done: yea, it often causes fearful
doubting, and despair, and so makes all the help which the Scripture
affords to be in vain.

. 21. Directions to keep men from despising the Cross.
WE ought therefore to be watchful against both these extremes, How we may
be kept from de^pising Gods corrections.
that we fall not into the former, observe these few directions.

1 In all afflictions look (as 2 Samuel 16. 11.
David did) unto him who smites, and know that they come not by chance, but by
Gods wise disposing providence: and that purposely to breed in us true remorse.

Know also that the Lord can add cross unto cross, till he pull down our
stout stomachs, or break our proud backs, and bring us to utter confusion.
Yea, know that his wrath is as his greatness, infinite, unsupportable: on
whomsoever it lights, it crusheth him down to hell: so that though a man
might think he could bear all outward crosses, yet Gods wrath can press him
much more heavily.

2 Take notice of the judgments which other men by despising the Lord, bring
upon themselves: this may work upon thine hard heart. It is an especial point
of wisdom to be warned by other men's harms. This was the wisdom of the
third captain which was sent to Eliah. 2 King. 1. 13. etc.
Note the issue.

3 Make use of the least crosses, and begin speedily to humble thy self. If
thy heart begin to be touched, suffer it not presently to be hardened again,
but more and more humble thy self. Thus will the Lord repent of the judgment
he intended, and turn from his wrath, as he did in the time of Hezekiah. Ier.
26. 18, 19.


. 22. Directions to keep men from fainting.
THat we fall not into the latter extreme, How we may be kept from fain^ing
under the cross.
observe these directions.

1 Cast not both eyes on our selves, and our own weakness, and the weight of
the crosses that lie upon us, but lift up one unto God, and unto his goodnes^
and consider how ready he is to succor in all time of need.

2 Call to mind his manifold promises: both those which respect his gracious
assistance of us in the trial, and his mighty deliverance of us out of it.

3 Remember examples of former times, how he never oppressed the^ that
patiently endured his corrections.

These two extremes are directly contrary to the two branches of this verse,
namely to the preparation here spoken of, and to the ground thereof, the
Gospel of Peace. If we be prepared, we shall not despise Gods corrections: if
prepared by the Gospel of Peace, we shall never faint: that will uphold us, or
nothing.

. 23. Answer to Satan's suggestion against the need of patience.
THe last point remaining to be handled, VII. Point. Satan's wyles to unfurnish
our souls.
is, to discover the cunning devices of the devil, whereby the laboreth to
keep us unfurnished and unprepared against troubles: they are many; I will
discover only four of the principal, by which all the rest may be discerned.

Two of these four are against the furniture it self: the other two against
the ground thereof, The Gospel of Peace.

Against the furniture he suggesteth,

1 That there is no need of it.

2 That if there should be need of it, yet it would stand a man in no steed.

The first he suggesteth before troubles come, to make them fear none, but be
careless.

The second when they are come, to make them despair and sink under the
burden. First therefore to this effect he obiecteth.

Suggestion 1. If ye be Gods children, what needs such ado about
preparation? What need of patience.
Do you think that God will not more tender and respect his then to suffer
them to fall into trobles? you may well enough be secure and fear nothing.
Thus the devil tempts many in their peace and prosperity: it appears that
Psalm. 30. 6.
David was in this manner assaulted.

Answ. Very great need.
Experience of all men in all ages does sufficiently confute the substance of
this suggestion, and plainly discover the falsehood of it (as. 12.
I showed before.) David, who was a while beguiled with this vain conceit,
quickly found out by woeful experience the deceit of it, and thereupon says
unto God, Psalm. 30. 7.
Thou did hide thy face, and I was troubled. It is very likely that then the
Devil beguiled him when his 2 Samuel 7. 1.
kingdom was fully established, and he had rest from all his enemies: observe
the history of his troubles, which came upon him after that, and ye shall find
it to be a very vain and false conceit.

As for the ground whereupon the suggestion is built, God in love and wisdom
corrects.
namely the good respect which God bears to his children, know, that God is
even thereby moved to lay many crosses upon them: for as he is a loving Father,
so he is a wise God: in wisdom he sees that it is needful his children
should be corrected: his very Heb. 12. 6.
love therefore moves him to correct them.

That we may oppose godly wisdom against the wicked policy of our enemy, In
peace be prepared against trouble.
let us have this furniture in a readiness, even in the time of our greatest
peace and prosperity, and so prepare our selves against trouble. To prepare for
troubles in time of prosperity before they come, is an especial means to make
us well bear them in time of adversity when they come. We know that death is
most fearful and terrible to them that least look for it: so are all
afflictions whatsoever.

. 24. Answer to Satan's suggestion against the benefit of Patience.
Suggest. 2. ALl the patience in the world can neither prevent, In what steed
can patience stand us?
nor remove the least cross that falls on man. In what steed then will this
furniture stand him?

Answ. In very great steed.
Though it were granted that patience could neither prevent, nor remove any
cross, yet will it stand us in very great steed. 1 lt enableth ^s to bea^e al
crosses.
For (to follow the metaphor) we know that though shoes and greaues make not
the way plain without stones, stubs and thorns; yet they make a man better
able to tread on them, and pass through, or over them, and keep his legs or
feet from being galled or pricked. So patience enableth us well to bear al^
troubles, and with some quietness to pass them over, and it keeps the soul
from being pierced: 2 It makes many crosses seem lighter.
Yea, it makes great and heavy burdens seem much lighter then otherwise they
would. Horat Leuius fit patientia quicquid corrigere est nefas.
The heathen who were guided only by the light of nature, observed thus much.
I have my self observed two several persons lying under the same cross. What
could make such a difference, but this preparation of the Gospel of peace? Pro.
18. 14.
The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can
bear?

Further I add, 3 It preuenteth and remoueth many.
that this preparation does prevent and remove many sore troubles; as anguish
of soul, vexation of spirit, disquietnesse of mind, distemper in affections,
with the like: which though they often rise from outward crosses, yet they often
prove more heavy burdens then those same from whence they did arise. For
example, a covetous man having a small loss which he might well bear, if he
were shod with this furniture, by his disquietnesse of mind, and impaciency for
that loss brings a much heavier cross upon him. So in sicken^sse, in
outward disgrace banishment, imprisonment, etc. the anguish of soul which
proceeds from an impatient heart, Peior est ^ello timor ipse belli. Senec.
often times proves to be the greatest cross. So the fear of troubles is often
worse the trouble it self: and fretting against the malice of an enemy does a
man more hurt then the enemy himself can. Now this furniture of the soul may
both prevent, and also remove these great and grievous crosses, as anguish of
mind and spirit, needless fears, fretfulnesse, envy, murmuring, with the like.

. 25. Answer to Satan's suggestion against Gods love in corecting.
AGainst the ground of this preparation, which is the Gospel of Peace, Satan
obiecteth one while that there is no reason to rely on it: another while, that
it procures more troubles to them that rest on it.

Suggest. Can there be peace with God while God scourges.
3. Troubles are fruits of Gods wrath: to conceit any peace with God while
troubles lie on us, is to call darkness light, and hatred love. To build
patience on assurance of reconciliation with God, is to cast anchor upon
quicke-sands, or in a bottomless Sea. A man may better hope for life when the
tokens of the plague appear upon his skin, then hope for reconciliation with
God, while troubles, the tokens of Gods wrath, lie upon him. The assaults of
Jobs wife and friends tended much to this purpose.

Answer. God in love corrects.
The ground of this suggestion being applied to the Saints, is directly false,
and contrary to the current of the Scripture, which often testifies that Prou.
3. 12. Heb. 12. 6.
whom the Lord loves he chasteneth. The ends which God aims at in correcting
his children, and the fruits which answerably issue from thence (whereof we
have heard. 13.
before) evidently demonstrate, that the troubles of the righteous are no
fruits of Gods wrath, but rather of his love. Yet a wonder it is to see how
many are deceived with this diabolical suggestion; and they not only profane
and wicked men, but even dear Saints of God, while the cross lies upon them,
as Psalm 79. 5
David. The reason is, because at that time Sense works more then Faith.
Wherefore for the avoiding of this assault, we must let faith have the
predominancy and highest rule in us, even above reason and sense: we must 2.
Cor. 5. 7
walk by faith, and not by sight. Faith rests on Gods word, and believes
what it says, though sense contradict it never so much. Now the word of God
affirming that God corrects whom he loves; if faith bear sway in us, it
will persuade us that in our greatest troubles God loves us, and in love
brings those troubles upon us. Wherefore for the strengthening of our faith,
let us often meditate of Heb. 12. 5
the consolations of the Scripture.

. 26. Answer to Satan's suggestion of the many troubles which Gods love causes.
Suggest. Is not the want of the Gospel the best way to be free from trouble?
THe Devil to show that he cares not which way he prevails, so he prevail
any way, has a contrary fetch. He will grant indeed that God scourges every
son whom he loves; but with all adds, that the more God loves any, ^he
more troubles he brings upon them; and therefore infers, that the Gospel
of peace is so far from being a means to defend us from trouble, that it is
the cause of much trouble; and therefore the best way to be free from trouble,
is to be without the Gospel of peace. Thus was Psa 73. 13. 14
David tempted: yea, thus were the Ier. 44. 18.
Israelites hearts hardened against God in Iere^^ahs time.

Answ. No verily.
It is false that the more God loves any, the more he scourges them: For as
Gods wisdom moves him to correct his children, so his love moves him to
moderate his correction. Besides, the inference, that therefore reconciliation
with God is no good remedy against troubles, is unsound and absurd: for,
assurance of our reconciliation with God, sweetneth all troubles. But for a
more full answer to this suggestion, note these four points concerning the
benefit of our peace with God in the case of afflictions.

1* That it keeps many judgments from us which fall upon the wicked: yea,
which otherwise would fall on us.

2* That it alters the nature of all troubles which befall us.

3. That by it we are assisted and supported in all.

4. That by reason thereof we shall be delivered and freed from all.

These 4 comfortable points I will distinctly prove, because by them all the evil
suggestio^s of Satan may be answered.

1 For the first, observe the threatenings in Gods word, 1 Peace with God
keeps many judgments away.
and ye shall find them made against such as (...).
hate God, and are hated of him. Read the 26. chap. of Leuit. and the 28 of
Deuteronomy. There Gods curses are denounced against the wicked, but his blessings
promised to the righteous: read the 91 Psalm. where David expressly confirms
this point, and shows how they which trust under the shadow of the Almighty,
and so have peace with him, are delivered from many troubles. Note the
Histories of the Jews vnderidolatrous and wicked Kings, and under religious
and good Kings; God being forsaken by them, brought many calamities upon them:
but being loved of these, delivered them from many which their enemies intended
against them: Yea, when general judgments were brought upon the Land, Ezec.
9. 4
God sent forth one to mark those whom he loved, that they might be spared
in the judgment. The reason is clear: for it is sin which causes the most
grievous judgments: Now the Gospel of peace being a means to move God to
for give us the sins which we have committed, and to move us to forsake our
sins, and to seek to please him, it must needs be a means to keep us from
many judgments, which otherwise would fall upon us. Besides, it keeps us
from a reprobate sense, (whereunto the Romans 1. 28.
heathen were given, and the Acts 28. 29.
Jews after they had lost their peace with God:) from despair, whereunto Mat.
27. 5.
Judas fell; and from hell fire, which Mat. 25. 46.
shall torment wicked men. These of all are the most woeful judgments, and
from these does the Gospel of peace wholly free men.

Here note what an egregious point of folly it is to fear to please God, for
fear of troubles; as if a man should fear to put on shoes, left his shoes
should cause stones to lie in his way: yet many fear to be at peace with God,
because it makes men to hate, revile, reproach, scorn, wrong, and persecute
them: not considering that Gods wrath is infinitely greater then man's. Are they
not like the fish that leapeth out of the warm water, into the flaming fire?
Or rather like selfe-murtherers, who to free themselves from some momentany
anguish in this world, cast themselves into hell torments, which is endless,
and easelesse?

. 28. Of the nature of the Saints affliction.
2 FOr the second; 2. It alters the nature of all crosses. (...).
the afflictions which befall the righteous, are called chastisements, and
corrections, even such as tender Parents lay upon their dear children; to show
that the nature of them is altered, the sting is pulled out, the curse is
removed; so that although the original ground of all afflictions was sin,
and they first i^vengeance executed for sin, yet now inflicted on the Saints,
they are not vindict^ue for revenge, but rathe^ medicinable for Physic: for
Christ has paid the ful^ price and ransom for all our sins, he has endured
the full punishment for them, and left nothing to be by way of expiation
endured of us.

Object. 2 Samuel 12. 14 Gods manner of punishing his childeren.
The Saints are punished for sin, as David.

Answer. True it is that God takes occasion from sin, to punish his
children, but not in vengeance for the sin committed which is past, but for a
warning to make them the more careful and watchful over themselves for the
time to come. And herein lies a maine difference betwixt the punishment of a
Judge and a Father: a Judge respects the fact past; if it be against the Law,
though the delinquent party be never so penitent, and though there be never
so great hope of his amendment, yet he denounces the sentence of Law against
the Malefactor: but if a father be verily persuaded that his child will never
commit the like trespass again, which he has committed, assuredly he would
remit the punishment: but when he corrects, it is to prevent the like in the
time to come.

God carries himself as a Judge to the wicked, but as a Father to the Saints:
his corrections are for their instruction, not for their destruction. As Heb.
12. 10.
God aims at his childrens good and profit in correcting them, so also he
gives them a sweet taste of the good they receive thereby, which makes them
Psalm. 119. 71. 75.
acknowledge as much, and he thankful for it; and so carry themselves toward
God, as a good patient toward his Physician, who has prescribed bitter pills
unto him: for the time he digests them willingly, and after he has felt a
kindly work of them, he thanketh them.

. 29. Of Gods assisting his children in affliction.
3 FOr the third, 3. By it, assistance in all troubles is obtained.
1 Cor. 10. 13 Heb. 13. 5.
many faithful promises has God made to stand by his children, to be with
them, and assist them in their several afflictions, and never to forsake them.
Hence is it that the Saints, to the great admiration of others, have patiently
endured such crosses, as many have thought they would have been utterly
pressed down with the heavy burden of them, even as the Barbarians looked when
Paul should have fallen down dead. Acts 28. 6.


. 30. Of Gods delivering his Children out of all afflictions.
4 For the last, 4. And at length full freedom from all cros^es.
Psalm. 34. 19.
many faithful promises has God likewise made to deliver his Children out of
all their troubles. Saint James sets before us the issue of Jobs trial, as
an evidence of this point, (saying, Ye have seen the end of the Lord; and
withal he renders a good reason thereof, Prou 118.
The Lord is very pitiful and merciful, ( Iam. 5. 11.) 1 Cor. 10. 13.


Object. Some lie all their life time under the cross.

Answ. Yet at the end of life, by death shall they be delivered; in which
respect the divine Oracle pronounces them Blessed that die in the Lord, Reu.
14. 13.
for they rest from the^ labors.

Object. So are the wicked delivered by death.

Answ. Nothing so: they fall from one misery to another, from a lighter to a
greater, from an earthly, to an hellish woe: so that herein lies a maine
difference, betwix^ the death of the wicked, and of the Saints. Death thrusts
the wicked from temporal troubles into eternal to^ments: but it delivers
the Saints from all trouble, and brings them to everlasting glory: Breuis est
molestia, aterna erit beatitudo, Aug. in Psalm. 36.
their misery shall soon have an end, their felicity shall never have end.

Thus then we see patience grounded upon the Gospel of peace, to be much
profitable every manner of way.

THE SIXTH PART.
The shield of Faith.
Ephesians. 6. 16. Above all, taking the shield of Faith, wherewith ye shall be
able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
. 1. Of the Apostles manner of pressing the point of Faith.
THe fourth piece of Spiritual Armor is more largely set forth, and more
forcibly urged then any of the rest. For the Apostle contenteth not himself
with a bare exhortation, to stir us up to use it, but with weighty reasons
presses his exhortation, and that on both sides, before and behind: Before,
comparatively, preferring it to all other graces (above all.) Behind, simply,
declaring the virtue and efficacy of it, (whereby ye shall be able to quench,
etc.) By the first he makes way to his exhortation; by the last he knocks it
down fast, even to the head, as we speak.

. 2. Of urging matters of moment:
HEre by the way we may learn a good instruction both for Ministers and
people.

For Ministers, Matters of weight to be pressed of Ministers.
that they observe what points be of greatest weight and by some special item
and memento, to raise up their peoples attention thereunto, yea, and with some
special evidence of reason and argument to enforce the same. Thus because the
observation of the fourth Commandment, is an especial means to bring men to
keep all the other Commandments, the Lord prefixed a memento (Remember the
Sabbath day) and withal uses many strong reasons, the more to stir us up to
keep it.

Thus is an expectation wrought in the hearers, Reasons.
of some point of moment; which will be an especial means to move them the
better to observe it, and to ponder it.

. 3. Of giving heed to weighty matters.
For people, that when they observe any one point above other to be urged and
pressed, they give the more diligent heed thereto: Heb. 2. 1. (...).
for if every duty laid down in Gods word be steadfast, that is, firm, sure,
and inviolable; so as the transgressors thereof shall reap a just recompense
of reward, how shall they escape who neglect those maine and principal duties,
which above others are most earnestly urged? Let that therefore which is most
pressed by the Spirit and Ministers of God, be best regarded by the people of
God.

Object. This especial heed of one point will make men careless of other.

Answ. Nothing less: for the end thereof is not to make us slothful in any
point, but to quicken us up, and make us extraordinarily careful in that which
is so urged. Suppose a master send his servant of a message, and give him many
things in charge to do, Simil.
but gives him an especial item for one, and uses many reasons to make him
careful of it, does he give his servant any occasion to neglect the other? or
will a good servant take any occasion from thence, to neglect them? Such
collections are made only by man's sloathfull flesh; they which gather them,
abuse the wisdom and care of God to help our weakness; they who are guided by
Gods Spirit, will be otherwise minded, knowing that an extraordinary urging of
one point, is to make us extraordinarily careful of that, but careless and
negligent of none.

. 4. The Resolution of the Text.
TWo points are to be noted in this verse. First, the transition, whereby the
Apostle passes from other points to this. Secondly, his exhortation unto the
grace here mentioned.

In his exhortation note 1 The matter thereof. 2 The motive thereto:


That lays down a duty to be performed (Take the shield of Faith.)

This declares the benefit of performing that duty in the last words, that ye
may be able to quench, etc.

In the duty observe, the action required, (take,) and the object thereof:
which is both plainly expressed (Faith) and also illustrated by a metaphor
(shield.)

The motive declares the power, virtue and efficacy of Faith; which is, to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Touching this grace thus set down, I
will deliver these points.

First in general by way of preface and preparation, I will first show how
excellent a grace it is: and then more particularly and distinctly declare,

2 What Faith is.

3 How fitly it is resembled to a shield.

4 How it is wrought.

5 How it must be proved.

6 How it may be preserved.

7 How it is to be used.

8 What it is the benefit, and power of it.

9 What are the wiles of the devil to keep us from it, and how they may be
avoided.

. 5. Of the preheminency of Faith above other graces.
I. I. Point. The excellency and necessity of Faith.
THe excellency, yea and necessity also of Faith is employed in this translation
( above all.) The (...).
original phrase is diversely translated, as thus Hieron. in omnibus. ad omnia.
in all, as if he had said, in all things whatsoever ye do, use the shield
of Faith: and thus, to all, as if he had said, to all other graces, add this:
and thus Beza. insuper, inprimis.
moreover, or especially, or (as we translate it) Eras. super omnia.
above all. All these in effect imply one and the same thing, only this latter
is somewhat more emphaticall, and as proper as any of the rest. This is
somewhat like to Pro. 4. 23. (...)
that Hebrew phrase, which Solomon uses, Keep thine heart above all keepings,
implying thereby, that the heart of all other parts is most narrowly to be
watched over, most carefully and diligently to be looked unto, so is Faith
above all to be regarded.

Quest. Is Faith simply more excellent and necessary, then other saving graces?

Answer. All saving graces are in their kind very excellent and necessary, as
has before been showed of verity, righteousness and patience: neither can a
Christian well spare, and be without any of them: for they are as several
linkes of one chain, whereby a Christian is held out of hell; if but one link
break, the chain is broken, and down falls he that was held thereby: yet
some linkes in a chain may be put to greatest stresse, and so be of greatest
use. Faith serves to bear the greatest brunts, and in that respect may be
counted most excellent, and most necessary; even as the shield of all other
parts of armor is the most needful, as we shall after hear.

. 6. Of pressing the doctrine of Faith.
THe Apostle uses this phrase ( above all) in the beginning of his
exhortation, to set an edge upon it, and to make it the sharper, that so it may
pierce the deeper into us: as if a captain should give diverse directions to
his soldiers, to instruct them to arm, and fence themselves, and among those
several directions, set some special item on one of them, and say, Above all
remember this, would not this item make him the more to regard it? As Gal. 6.
10.
where the Apostle says, Do good to all, especially to them who are of the
household of Faith: does it not make a Christian so much the more to be moved
with compassion, when he sees any of the faithful stand in need of his
help? Hence then I observe that,

Among, Obs. Faith especially to be taught and learned.
and above other po^nts and principles of Christian Religion, and mysteries of
godliness the doctrine of Faith is especially to be opened and urged by Gods
Ministers, and to be learned and observed by Gods people. What point thorowout
the whole Scripture is more urged? all the rites and types of the Law, set
forth the doctrine of faith, Romans 10. 8.
Moses, and the Act. ^0. 43.
Prophets preached it, so did the Act. 19. 4.
forerunner of Christ, Mar. 1. 15.
Christ himself, and his Romans 10 8.
Apostles. For some especial instances of this point, read and observe Ioh.
3. 14. etc.
Christ's conference with Nicodemus, and Paul's Epistles to Romans and Gal.

No other doctrine more sets forth the glory of God, Reasons.
and more makes to the good of his Church and children.

. 7. Of the honor which Faith does unto God.
GOd is then honored, Faith most of all sets forth Gods glory by
acknowledging
when he is acknowledged to be as he is, namely, most holy, wise, true,
powerful, merciful, just, etc. But the believer, and the believer only so
acknowledges him.

1 For God holiness, 1 Gods holiness.
how approaches the believer before God? surely in an utter ab^egation of
himself, and in the mediation of Christ Jesus: for well he knows, that
himself is all over defiled with sin, and that Jesus Christ the Just, is an
advocate with the Father, who by his blood purges us from our sins, and with
his righteousness covers us. This manner of appearing before God, shows,
that the believer acknowledges God to be so perfectly holy, as he cannot
endure the sight of any unclean thing.

2 For Gods wisdom: 2 Gods wisdom.
who are they that subject themselves to God in all estates of prosperity and
adversity? Believers only. Why then? their faith persuades them that God is
wisest, and best knows what estate is fittest for them, and so even against
their own sense and natural reason, faith makes them wholly resign
themselves to Gods wise providence, and in that respect to be thankful in all
things.

3 For Gods truth: 3 Gods truth
he that believes, Ioh. 3. 33.
has sealed that God is true: for what makes men believe, but that they judge
him who has promised that which they believe, to be faithful and true? Faith
then is an acknowledgement, and a confirmation of Gods truth, which is an high
honor given to God, for God makes great reckoning and account of his truth.

4 For Gods power: 4 Gods power.
many of the promises which God makes to his children, are of things which
seem impossible: yet faith gives assent thereunto, and thereby testifies
that God is Almighty, that nothing is impossible to him. Thus Romans 4. 20, 21.
Abram by his faith did magnify Gods power, and so did 2 Chr. 20.12.
Iehosaphat also.

5 For Gods mercy: 5 Gods mercy.
that is the especial and most proper object of Faith. If the poor sinner
were not persuaded that God were rich, yea even infinitely rich in mercy, he
could never believe the pardon of his sins: faith then is it which above all
commends Gods mercy.

6 For Gods Justice: 6 Gods Justice.
what makes believers so strongly trust unto, and wholly rely upon the
sacrifice of Christ? Because on the one side they believe God to be so
perfectly just, that without expiation and satisfaction for sin, there can be
no hope of mercy: and on the other side, the sacrifice of Christ being of such
infinite value, as to make full satisfaction to Gods Justice, they believe that
God will not exact that of them, for which Christ has satisfied, but will
manifest favor to them, because Christ has purchased favor for them. These
are points of Justice, to require satisfaction, to remit that for which
satisfaction is made, to bestow that which is merited and purchased. But Faith
acknowledges all these, and so commends Gods Justice; for it has respect to
Gods Justice, as well as to his mercy.

Object. Sinners (repentant and believing sinners) use to appeal from the
bar of Gods Justice, to his mercy-seate: what respect then has Faith to Gods
Justice?

Answer. In regard of themselves, How faith rests on Gods Justice.
and their own manifold pollutions and imperfections, even in their best
works, they dare not stand to the trial of Gods Justice, but cry for mercy
and pardon: but yet in confidence of the All-sufficient sacrifice of Christ
Jesus, they may appeal to Gods Justice: for God is not unjust to require a
debt that is paid.

In these and other like respects, it is said of Rom 4. 20.
Abrah^^, That he was strengthened in the Faith, and gave glory to God. So does
every believer in some measure: the stronger faith is, the more glory is given
to God. But on the contrary, no sin is more dishonorable to God then
infidelity: for that which is said of one particular, 1 John 5. 10.
He that believes not, makes God a liar, may be applied to the rest, he
makes God unwise, impotent, merciless, unjust, etc.

. 8. Of the good which Faith brings unto man.
IN regard of man's good, Faith of all other graces is the most necessary,
profitable, and comfortable.

It is the first of all saving graces wrought in the soul of a Christian, as
the heart is the first member framed in the body. Yea, it is a mother-grace,
which breeds and brings forth other graces, as the heart being quickened,
sends forth life into all the other parts. Faith the first grace.


That it is the first, Fides est prima quae subiugat animam Deo. Aug. de agon.
Chr. cap. 12.
is evident: for Christ is that fountain in whom all fullness dwells, (Col.
1. 19.) of whose fullness al^ receive, ( Ioh. 1. 16.) without whom we can do
nothing, ( Ioh. 15. 5.) Now it is Faith whereby we touch Christ: By Faith,
Christ dwells in our hearts, ( Ephesians. 3. 17.) The spiritual life which we
live, we live by Faith in the Son of God, ( Gal. 2. 20.) therefore till by
Faith we be ingraffed into Christ, no true, saving grace can be in a man.
Without Faith, it is impossible to please God, ( Heb. 11. 1.)

That also it is a mother grace is clear, Faith a Mother grace.
for from Faith springs repentance, love, new obedience, etc. Repentance is a
change of the heart, as the (...)
notation of the Greek word implies. Now what is it that changes the heart
of a sinner? Is it not the apprehension of Gods infinite love and rich mercy? a
persuasion that a man's sins are pardoned? The apprehension of Gods wrath, and
fear of hell fire, may work some sorrow for sin committed; yea also it may
restrain a man from committing many sins, at least for a time: but that
which alters the natural disposition of the heart, which changes and
reformeth it, is Faith in the remission of sin: Act. 15. 9. Love a fruit of
Faith.
By Faith God purifieth the hearts of men.

True Christian love also is a reflection of Gods love to man: till a man feel
Gods love to warm his heart, and to set it on fire, he can love neither God
nor man. He that loves his brother aright, must love him in and for the Lord,
and so must love God before: but it is not possible for any to love God, except
he believe that God loves him. Can a piece of iron give heat and burn, except
it be first heated by the fire? But our hearts are naturally more destitute of
love to God, then any iron of heat: they must therefore be set on fire by Gods
love, and a sweet apprehension thereof, before they can love God: 1 Ioh. 4. 19.
We love God, because he loved us first: It is Gal. 5. 6.
Faith which works by love. Thus I might further show how all other
sanctifying graces spring from Faith. But what follows from thence? surely
this, that if any sanctifying and saving grace be needful, then is Faith
especially, which is the Mother of all; without it, no grace at all, no life at
all: for the just shall live by his Faith, Fides est vitis, virtus palms:
siquidem nec palms absque vite, nec virtus. sine fide aliquid est. Ber^. sup.
Cant. sermon. 30.
( Hab. 2. 4.) From faith comes the spiritual life of a Christian in this
world. ( Gal. 2. 20.) and eternal life in the world to come ( Ioh. 3. 16,
etc.) Yea, no benefit from Christ without Faith: though Christ Ioh. 3. 34.
received the spirit without measure, and Col. 1. 19.
it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell: yet to such as
have no faith, he is as Ioh. 4 11. Faith profitable.
a deep well, out of which no water of life can be had.

But when a man has faith, what is the profit and benefit thereof? Much every
way. Ephesians. 3. 17.
By faith Christ dwells in our hearts, and so we are united to him. Romans 1.
17.
By Faith we live: by Faith we are and 3 25.
reconciled, and 28.
justified, Act. 15. 9.
sanctified, Ephesians. 2. 8.
saved. It were infinite to reckon up all the benefits of Faith. In regard of
profit and benefit to ourselves, it far surpasses all other graces. By other
graces, as love, mercy, kindness, wisdom, and the like, we may be profitable
to others: but Faith is it which draws and brings in to our selves, bodies
and souls, all the profit.

It is also a grace of admirable comfort: Faith comfortable.
this is it which brings Romans 5. 1.
peace of conscience, Phil. 4^7.
That peace of God which passes all understanding: this vpholdeth in all
troubles, and that many times above and against sense and reason. All comfort
without Faith is in vain: when all other comforts fail, then may faith uphold
us. Thus faith vpheld Job 13. 15.
Job, 1 Samuel 30. 6.
David, 2 Chr. 20. 12
Iehosaphat. When other graces, and the testimony of our conscience fail,
Faith may support us: for the conscience has respect to the man himself, to
his disposition and carriage, which is subject to many temptations, and many
alterations: but Faith has respect to GOD and his promises, to Christ and his
sacrifice, which are props, or rather rocks that never fail. In this respect
is Faith fitly compared to a shield: for as a soldier who has a good shield,
and is able well to use it, will not utterly be discouraged, but stand out in
the battle, though his head-peece be cracked, his breast plate battered, his
girdle loose, etc: So when verity, righteousness, patience, and other like
graces seem to fail, he that has sound faith will not utterly be quailed and
confounded.

Faith being so excellent a grace, as that whereby God is most honored, so
necessary, profitable, and comfortable a grace as has been showed; what point
of Christian Religion is rather to be made known, is more to be pressed,
oftener to be inculcated? about what can a Minister of Gods word better spend
his time, study, and pains? For Faith is the most proper and principal object
of the Gospel, which is therefore called, Romans 10. 8.
The Word of Faith, Gal. 3. 2.
The preaching of Faith, yea, 1 Timothy 1. 19.
Faith it self.

. 9. Of the high account which we ought to make of Faith.
AS Ministers are most to preach this Doctrine, so are people to learn it
above all, to be very well instructed in it, that they may know what true faith
is: yea, to examine themselves whether they have in them this grace or no: if
not, to enquire how it may be gotten, how discerned and proved: if they have
it, to labor well to preserve, increase, and use it: for Faith is a capital
grace. We must therefore in this respect learn wisdom of the Serpent, who
has an especial care of his head: if he be assaulted and cannot fly, he
will cover his head with the rest of his body, and suffer it to be stricken and
wounded rather then his head. We ought to be the more careful of this Head
Virtue, because Satan (who well knows the worth of it) seeks most to
assault it. Is it not good wisdom to look to that most of all, which he most
of all si^teth? Of these points I shall more distinctly speak afterward. This
I thought good to premise by way of preparation unto the discourse following,
taking occasion from the Apostles Preface, above all.

. 10. Of the Papists c^uill against Faith.
IF any popishly minded shall think, Object.
or say, that so much preaching and learning of Faith, is an hinderance to good
works, and makes men careless of all piety and charity.

I answer, Answer. The doctrine of Faith no hinderance to good works.
that if any be so minded, they are 2 Cor. 4* 3. Opera sunt exfide, non ex
operibus fides. Aug. de gr. and lib. ^rb. cap. 7.
blinded by the god of this world, that the light of the glorious Gospel
should not shine unto them. The truth is, that no other doctrine can make men
more conscionable in performing all duty to God and man, then the doctrine of
faith. From Faith proceed all good works: For it is faith in Gods love which
moves a man to love God again, and love to God is it which moves a man to
love his brother, which is made after Gods Image, and stands in Gods room
and steed. Now there can be no stronger motive to stir up a man to any duty
then love: A loving child will much more seek to please his father, then a
servile bond-slaue: and a loving friend will do much more kindness for a
friend, then a stranger, though he be hired thereunto. He that indeed believes
that God so loved him, as he spared not his only begotten Son, but gave him
a price of redemption; that in his Son God has vouchsafed to be reconciled
to him, to give him pardon of all his sins, freedom from hell and damnation,
and to bestow on him all things pertaining to life and happiness* he that is
thus persuaded of GODS love to him, cannot but have his hearten arged to do
what may be pleasing and acceptable to God: no hope of reward, no fear of
revenge can so provoke a man to all good works, as love which Faith works.
Besides, Romans 13. 3. Heb. 11. 6.
whatsoever is performed without Faith and love, is no whit acceptable to God:
God accepts a cup of cold water given in Faith and love, infinitely much more
then thousands of rams, or ten thousand Rivers of Oil given in way of
presumptuous merit, or else of slavish fear.

The objection therefore of our adversaries against the Doctrine of Faith, Quid
fides co^feret emolumeti si vita sincera non fuerit, and pura^ Chrysostom. aduer.
vit. mon. lib. 1.
is a mere cavil and slander. They who take liberty thereby, either to commit
any evil, or to omit any good, turn the grace of our God into wanton^esse, (
Jude 4.) and pervert it to their own destruction. (2. Pet, 3. 16.)

. 11. Of Faith in general.
THus much concerning the Transition. The Exhortation follows: wherein we are
first to consider the thing simply set down, and to show what faith is.

Faith in general is a believing of a thing to be true.; what faith is.
Our English word Faith seems to be taken from the Lattin fides, which
according to the notation thereof is as much as Cic. offic. lib. 1
fi^t dictum, be it so as is spoken. (...)
The notation of the Greek word implies as much: so also of the ^ Hebrew, in
which language one and the same word signifies Truth and Faith, from whence is
derived that common Hebrew word which is usually uttered at the end of our
prayers, Amen; which signifies an assent of the mind to that which is spoken,
as to truth.

. 12. Of the kinds of Faith.
THis assent may be either to the word of the Cre^^^, or of the creature. The
faith of which now we speak, has reference to the Creator and his word, and
may in general be defined a belief of the truth of God. Faith thus taken, is
either common to al, or proper to the elect. That common faith is
extraordinary, or ordinary.

Mat. 17. 22.
Extraordinary Faith, Miraculous faith.
is a belief that some extraordinary and miraculous thing shall fall out. This
is grounded either upon some especial promise, or extraordinary revelation
made to the party in whom it is: and it is given but at some special times, to
some special persons, on some special occasions: Ioh. 11. 10. 51
by it things to come may be foretold, or other Mat. 7. 22.
great works done: It is a gift of the Spirit, but one of those which are
given, rather for the good of others, then of that party which has it; 1 Cor.
12. 9, 10.
so as it may be in a wicked reprobate, Mat. 7. 22.
as in those who shall plead it at Christ's Judgment Seat, but in vain. This
is that which commonly is called a Miraculo^^ Faith.

Ordinary Faith, Historical faith.
is either that which rests only in the mind of a man, or else draws the
will also. The former of these is that Faith whereby an assent is given to the
truth of Gods word. This is commonly called as historical Faith: because
thereby credence is yielded to the History of Gods word, that is, all things
which are written in Gods word, are believed to be true. This may one do which
is not any whit the better affected (...) Gods word, either to love God, or
fear him, or trust in him the more for this faith. For thus the very Iam. 2.
19.
Di^el^ are said to believe.

The latter kind of ordinary faith common to all sorts, Temporary faith.
as well reprobate as elect, is that faith whereby such an assent of the mind
is given to the Gospel, and to the gracious promises thereof, as the heart is
affected with them, and rejoices in them for a season. Acts 8. 13.
This was in Simon Magus, who in regard thereof yielded to be baptized: and in
those Jews who were willing for a season to rejoice in Ioh. 5. 35.
John's light. This is commonly called a temporary Faith, because it lasts not
for ever, but clean fades away, and that for the most part while a man lives
here in this World, especially if he be brought to any trial. Lu. 8. 13.
Christ fitly compares this faith to corn sown in stony ground. I deny not
but that it may continue so long as a man lives, but then with his life it
ends without any fruit, as smoke that clean vanishes away to nothing: in
which respect Pro. 11. 7. Hypocritical Faith.
The hope of a wicked man is said to perish when he dies. This faith is also
called an hypocritical faith, not because he that has it does only make an
outward flourish in show, purposely to deceive men; for then could not the
heart be affected, nor the man rejoice therein: but because it is not sound,
but appears both to the party himself, Two kinds of hypocrisy.
and also to others, to be better and sounder then indeed it is: for there is a
double hypocrisy, one whereby men purposely seek to deceive others, as the
Mat. 23. 14, 25.
Pharisees: another whereby they deceive themselves, as Acts 26. 9. Phil. 3. 6.
Paul. That former arises from vainglory, covetousness, and such by
respects: this latter from ignorance, simplicity, slothfulness, carelessness,
security, and the like, which keep men from trying that grace which appears
to be in them, whether it be sound or no. This faith is called hypocritical,
in opposition to an attribute proper to true ^auing faith, namely 1 Timothy 1. 5.
and 2 Timothy 1, 5. (...)
unfeigned.

. 13. Of the titles given to true Faith.
THe faith which is here meant by the Apostle, Justifying faith.
is a far more precious Faith then any of these: it is proper to the Elect,
and by a propriety called, Tit. 1. 1.
The faith of Gods Elect: for none but the Elect have it, and all the Elect
have it at one time or another: when once they have it, they never utterly or
totally lose it, but it continues with them till it has brought them to the
purchased inheritance, even to the possession and fruition of that which they
believed, at which time they shall have no more need of it. It is therefore
called saving Faith, because Ephesians. 2. 8.
it brings us unto salvation; and justifying Faith, because it is that means
or instrument which Gods Spirit works in us, whereby we apply unto our selves
Christ Jesus, in and by whom Romans 3. 28.
we are justified: and sanctifying Faith, because Acts 15. 9.
by it God purifieth our hearts.

. 14. Of the definition of justifying Faith.
THis true, Definitio.
sound, There are many definitions of true faith given by learned and godly
men, which though they differ in some words and phrases, yet if they be well
examined, they will be found to agree all in substance: some may be more
copious, some more succinct, yet in effect all the same: The Scripture it self
(which was all given by inspiration of God) does often va^^e the phrase, in
setting down this true faith whereof we now speak: as to believe God. Romans 4.
3. ( Credere Deo.) To believe in God. Job. 14. 1. ( credere in Deu^) or in the
Lord Jesus. Acts. 16. 31. To believe in the name of God. Ioh. 1. 12. To believe
the Gospel, etc. Mar. 1. 15. Neither is there any more cause why men should
stumble and be offended with the diverse phrases and words wherewith faith is
defined by several men, then with the diverse manner of setting down the same
Histories of Christ by the several Evangelists.
unfeigned, justifying, sanctifying, saving Faith, whereof we now speak; I
say, this Faith is a belief of the Gospel, whereby Christ and all his benefits
offered therein, are received.

In this definition note the two usual parts of a definition, 1. Genus.
The common matter of it, ( A belief of the Gospel) 2. F^^m^.
The particular form, or difference ( whereby Christ, etc.) The former shows
wherein true justifying faith agrees with other kinds of faith: the latter
wherein it differs from them.

1 It is a belief) this it has common with all kinds of faith; Genus remotum.
where there is no belief, no credence, no assent given, Many leave out this
common genus ( a belief of the Gospel) and in steed of it pu. in genus
remotius, viz. a work of Gods Spirit. But they who leave out either of these,
suppose them to be necessarily understood. Other in the form express Christ
alone, and not his benefits: yet they understand Christ with all his benefits.
Some make this the form of faith, To be persuaded that Christ is his: some
this, To apprehend or lay hold on Christ; some this, To apply Christ unto
himself. These and other like phrases, do in effect imply no other thing then
to receive Christ which word I have the rather used, because it is the very
word and phrase of the holy Ghost. ( Ioh. 1. 12. Heb. 11. 17.) and as proper,
pertinent, and perspicuous as any of the rest: for there is a receiving on the
souls part, as well as on the bodies.
there is no faith at all.

2 Of the Gospel) though the whole word of God be the general object of
justifying Faith, Genus proximum.
yet the Gospel is the special object thereof: by it is the heart of a
believer especially moved, and affected; and this is it which justifying faith
has common with that kind of faith that comes nearest unto it, and is
hardly distinguished from it, namely a temporary faith. What the Gospel is we
have showed Treat. 2. Part 5.. 4.
before. The sum of it is plainly and fully laid down by Christ himself,
in these words, Ioh. 3. 16.
God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, Thus in all
this variety we see there is no contrariety at all: no discrepancy in substance
of matter, but only in circumstance of phrase.
that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.

3 Whereby Christ and all his benefits offered therein.) Again, where some
define faith to be a resting on God, the difference betwixt them and other, is
only in order; for they make a persuasion of Gods mercy in Christ, to follow
upon a man's resting on God: these make resting on God (which is confidence) to
follow upon the forenamed persuasion: this difference therefore implies no
contradiction, or contrariety in matter. This I thought good to note, both to
prevent the cauils of adversaries, and also remove a stumbling block from the
weak.
Christ Jesus is the subject matter, Certum propriumque fidei fu^ damentum
Christus est, Aug. Enchir. cap. 5.
and very substance of the Gospel, and so the proper and peculiar object of
justifying faith. Christ I say, not barely and nakedly considered in himself
(for then were he no Savior) but accompanied with all those benefits, which as
our Mediator and Redeemer he wrought and purchased for us. The Apostle sets
down four of those benefits, 1 Cor. 1. 30.
Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption: under which the other may
be comprised. These are said to be offered in the Gospel.

1 Because of the necessary relation betwixt receiving and offering: for
receiving presupposes an offering.

2 To show the ground of our receiving, which is Gods free offer.

3 To show that all they who receive not Christ, plainly reject him: and so are
justly condemned for rejecting him.

4 Are received) In the act of receiving, the nature of justifying faith
especially consists, for thereby is Christ made a man's own: in this the best
temporary faith that may be, comes short of justifying faith: for all that
joy which temporary believers conceive, arises not from any true possession of
Christ, but only from some apprehension of those great and excellent things,
which in the Gospel are promised. Justifying faith is as it it were the hand
of the soul, a spiritual instrument framed in our hearts by the Spirit of
God, whereby we lay hold on Christ, and apply or take unto our selves, and
receive those things which God in the Gospel offers unto us. Ioh. 6. 53, 54.
This word of receiving, fitly answers that metaphor of eating and drinking,
Mat. 26. 26, 27
so often used in the Scripture to set forth the nature of Faith. Ye know that
all the benefit we receive by food, comes from our eating and drinking it:
though there be set before a man great plenty of dainty and wholesome cheer,
yet if it be not eaten, where is the benefit of it? so in vain is Christ with
all his benefits offered, if he be not received.

Fitly also does it answer another excellent metaphor, Ephe. 5. 32. 2 Cor. 11.
2.
(namely of marriage) which is often used in the holy Scripture, to set forth
that near union which is betwixt Christ and the faithful. God makes offer of
his Son in marriage to mankind: Christ came down from heaven to be a suter,
and to be espoused: Ministers his friends, entreat us in Christ's steed, to
accept him; when in our hearts we accept this offer, and receive this Son of
God to be our husband, then in truth and indeed we believe, and not before.

Thus have I opened this definition of Faith in the several parts thereof: out
of it two especial points are to be noted.

1 That every faithful soul, In Faith there is an assent of mind.
every true believer gives a full assent in his mind to the truth of the
Gospel, that Ioh. 3. 16.
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life: so as here is
excluded, Iam. 1. 6.
a wavering opinion (for belief is a strong persuasion;) and also a
presumptuous conceit, (for the Gospel is Ephesians. 1. 13.
the Word of Truth, which cannot deceive.)

2 That with the assent of the mind, 2 A consent of will.
there goes a consent of the will: soas what the believer conceiueth in his
understanding to be true, he embraces in his will to be good, and so in his
heart joyfully receives that fa^^r which God freely offers unto him, namely,
Christ Ie Jesus, and in, and with him all things needful to salvation.

Thus by Gods offer of his Son in the Gospel, and our receiving of him by
Faith, we come to be espoused to Christ, Cant 2. 16.
as a Bride to her Bridegroom: to be in graffed into him, Romans 11. 24.
as sciences into a stock: 1 Cor. 12. 12.
to be of one body with him, he the head, we the members, and so he and we to
make one Christ. By the Faith here spoken of, Ephesians. 3. 17.
Christ dwells in our hearts, he is ours, and we are his. This, and nothing
but this is it wherewith we shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
wicked.

. 15. Of the resemblance betwixt Faith and a Shield.
NOw further mark how fitly this Faith is compared to a Shield. III. Point.
Faith fitly compared to a shield.


A Shield is a general fence for the whole body, especially for the principal
parts, the head and heart. There are sundry kinds of shields, bucklers, and
targets used in war: some round and small, some square, some like an half
moon, some after one fashion, some after another, and accordingly they have
diverse names. (...)
The Greek word which here the Apostle uses, is taken from (...)
a door or gate: so as it signifies, a long, broad, large shield, wherewith
the whole body was covered. The use of it is both to avoid handy blows, The
use of a Shield.
strokes, foines, pushes and the like, made with Sword, Halberd, Sp^are, and
such like weapons; and also to keep off Darts, Arrows, Bullets, Stones, and
such annoyances as were shot, and flung afar off: so as it is a common
defense against all sorts of weapons, all kinds of assaults.

Of this use is Faith, Application of the metaphor.
able to defend the whole man from al sorts of temptations cast against him by
any of his spiritual enemies, the flesh, world, or devil. By Faith the
believer holds out Christ himself, and the power and efficacy of his
obedience and suffering, against all spiritual assaults: if this defend him
not from all, what can? This will keep us safe from temptations, taken from
the corruption of our nature, imperfection of our obedience, innumerable
number, and infinite weight of our sins, from prosperity, adversity, or the
like, if at least it be well used. Of the well using of it, we shall. 68. etc.
afterward hear.

. 16. Of the meaning of the word Take.
THe next point to be handled, is the Action whereunto we are exhorted in this
word (...).
Take, which is the very same that he used before, verse 13. it is here used
in as large a sense, both to take up, or to take unto one, and also to take
again and recover a thing. Soldiers let not their Shield lie on the ground,
but take it up in their hands, hold it our against their enemies, moving it up
and down every way where the enemy strikes at them; if the enemy continue to
fight, or renew the fight, they still hold it out again and again: yea, if by
their own weakness, or through the violence of any blow, they let it fall, or
slip, they presently seek to recover it, and take it up again.

Thus must we take up and hold forth this spiritual Shield of Faith against
all the temptations of Satan: and if through our own infirmity, or our enemies
fierceness we suffer it to fail and fall away, then recover it again, and
continue to defend our selves with it, so long as we shall have enemies to
assault us.

This point of taking the Shield of Faith, respects diverse sorts of people:

1 Them who have it not; they must labor to get it.

2 Them who doubt whether they have it, or no: they must prove it.

3 Them who fear they may lose it; they must seek to preserve it.

4 Them who are established therein; they must well use it.

I will therefore in order show how faith may be 1 Gotten. IIII. Point. How
Faith is gotten.
2 Proved. 3 Preserved. 4 Well used.


. 17. Of the Author of Faith.
FOr the first, note first the Author of Faith. Secondly, the means whereby it
is wrought.

1 The Author of Faith is, God the Author of Faith.
even Iam. 1. 17.
he from whom every good giving, and every perfect gift comes. Ephe. 2. 8.
Faith is the gift of God. Ioh. 6. 29.
This is the work of God that ye believe etc. Now because this is one of
those works of God, which are said to be ad extra.
without toward the creature, it is in Scripture attributed to all the three
persons, and to every of them. To the first, where Christ says, Ioh. 6. 44.
No man con^^me unto me (i) believe) except the Father draw him. To the second,
where the Apostle calls Heb. 12. 2.
Jesus the Author and finisher of our Faith. To the third, where the Apostle*
Gal. 5. 22.
reckons Faith among the fruits of the Spirit.

. 18. Of the motive and end why God works Faith.
IN declaring why God works Faith, observe, 1 What moves him thereto. 2 What
he aims at therein.


Nothing out of God can move God to work this precious gift in man: Phil. 2.
13.
It is his mere good will that moves him, as Mat. 11. 26.
Christ expressly declares in his thanksgiving to God, saying, It is so, O
Father, because thy good pleasure is such.

The end which God aims at in working this grace is principally in respect of
himself, Ephesians. 1. 6.
the setting forth of his own glory, as we showed before: but secondarily the
Ioh. 3. 16. and 20. 31.
salvation of mankind. Therefore Saint Peter terms 1 Pet. 1. 9.
salvation the end of our Faith.



1 To commend unto you this precious gift of Faith. For how much the more
excellent the Author of any thing is, and the end which he aims at therein,
so much more excellent is the thing it self.

2 To take away all matter of boasting from them who have this gift: though it
be a most precious grace, yet 1 Cor. 4. 7.
it affords no matter of glorying to us in our selves, because we have it not
of our selves.

3 To stir us up to give all the praise and glory thereof to God: upon this
very ground does the Apostle give Romans 11. 33.
glory to God, because of him, and through him, and for him are all things.

4 To show that it is not in man's power to have it when he will; that so ye may
be the more careful in using the means which God affoordeth and appoints
for the attaining thereto. Is it not a point of egregious folly to be careless
in using, or negligently to put off those means of obtaining any excellent
thing, which he who only can work and bestow that thing, has appointed for
the obtaining thereof?

. 19. Of the means of working Faith.
IN laying down the means which our wise God has appointed to work Faith,

I will show, 1 What God himself does. 2 What he requires man to do.


In considering what means God uses, let us all note what order he observes
in making the means effectual.

The means are, Outward. Inward.


The outward means are either such as both work and strengthen Faith, The
means of getting Faith.
as the word of God: or only strengthen it, as the Sacraments. Hereof I shall
speak. 65, 66.
hereafter.

Concerning the Word, Gods word the outward means. Accenditur fidei lampas
igne diuini verbi. Chrysostom. in Mat. 25.
the Apostle says, r How shall they believe in him of whom they have not
heard? and thereupon thus concludes, Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by
the word of God, ( Romans 10. 14, 17.) Of Gods word there be two parts, the Law,
and the Gospel. Both these have an especial work for the working of Faith.
The law to prepare a man's heart for Faith, in which respect it is called Gal. 3
24.
our schoolmasters to bring us to Christ, that we may be justified by Faith.
The Gospel to work further upon the heart so prepared, and to accomplish this
work of Faith: whereupon he terms the Gospel by a propriety, Romans 10. 8.
The Gospel of Faith: and says of the Ephesians, Ephesians. 1. 13.
that they believed after that they heard the Gospel.

Quest. Whether is the Word preached only, or the Word read also a means of
working Faith?

Answ. It may not be denied but that the holy Scriptures themselves, Preaching
the Word is the most proper means of working faith.
and good Commentaries on them, and printed Sermons, or other books, laying
forth the true doctrine of the Scripture, being read and understood, may be the
blessing of God work Faith: but the especial ordinary means, and most
powerful usual means, is the word preached: this is it which the Scripture
lays down Romans 10. 14.
How shall they bele^ue in him, of whom they have not heard? how shall they
hear without a Preacher? 1 Cor. 1. 21
It pleased God by preaching to save, etc. Gal. 3. 2.
Ye received the Spirit by the hearing of Faith.

Thus we see that preaching is Gods ordinance, whereunto especially without
question he will give his blessing. Besides, it is an especial means to make
people to embrace the promises of the Gospel, when Gods Ministers 2 Cor. 5. 16,
20.
to whom is committed the word of reconciliation, and who stand in Christ's
steed, as though God did beseech us, shall pray us to be reconciled to God, and
make offer and tender unto us of all the promises of God.

The inward means (or rather cause) is the sanctifying Spirit of God, Gods
Spirit the inward cause.
who softneth, quickneth, opens our hearts, and makes them as good ground,
so as the good seed of Gods word being cast into them, takes deep rooting,
and brings forth the blessed fruit of Faith. The 1 Cor. 2. 4, 5
Apostle says, that his preaching was in demonstration of the spirit, that
their Faith might be in the power of God. It is noted that Act. 16, 14.
the Lord (namely by his Spirit) opened the heart of Lydia, that she attended
unto the things which Paul spoke. In respect hereof the Apostle terms the
preaching of the Gospel, 2 Cor. 3. 8.
a ministration of the spirit: yea, he uses this phrase, and 4. 13.
the spirit of Faith, because Faith is wrought inwardly by the Spirit.

. 20. Of the Laws work toward Faith.
THe order which God uses is this, The order of working faith
First, he works on the understanding, and then on the will.

The understanding he inlighteneth by his Word, 1 The understanding enlightened.
as in all fundamental necessary points of Christian Religion, so in two
especially: First, in the misery of a natural man, Secondly, in the remedy
thereof. That the Law discovers. This the Gospel reuealeth.

Touching man's misery, Gods Spirit by the Law informs a man's judgment both
of his wretchedness through sin, and of his cursednesse through the punishment
of sin. Man's misery made known by the Law. Perlegem fit cognitio pec^ati and
expraeu^ricatione legis abundantia peccati, Aug. epist. 9 5.
The Law discovers such an infinite multitude of sins, as otherwise man
could not possibly find out. It discovers not only notorious sins of
commission, but many other transgressions which natural men count no sins;
many sins of omission, many sins of thought and heart, yea, the very seed
of all sin, the contagion and corruption of our nature. Saint Paul expressly
says; Romans 7. 7.
I knew not sin but by the Law: for I had not known lust, except the Law had
said, thou shall not lust. The Law also makes known the heinousness, and
greeuousnesse of sin, how it is out of measure, yea, infinitely sinful,
because it is committed against an infinite Majesty, and that also against his
express will revealed in the Law; so as sin being directly contrary to the
pure, holy, and blessed will of God, cannot but make us more odious and
abominable before God then any venomous Toade, Adder, or any other poisonous
creature is in our sight.

Further the Law manifests the punishment of sin, which is Gods infinite
wrath for the least breach of any one branch of the commandments: for it
says, Deuteronomy. 27. 26.
Cursed be he that confirms not all the words of the Law. Now the fruits of
Gods wrath are all plagues and judgments in this world, both outward in our
estates, and on our bodies; and inward in our conscience and soul; in the and
death, which is exceeding terrible to a natural man: and after all, the
torment of hell fire, which is intolerable and everlasting: neither does it
reveal unto us any remedy of help, but rather shows that we are utterly
unable to help our selves, and that no creature in heaven or earth, is able to
afford us help or succor; but vile woeful wretches as we are, so shall we
continually remain.

Thus the Law shows us to be such creatures, as it had been better for us
never to have been borne, or if borne, then to have been any other then such
as we are, wretched cursed men.

. 21. Of the Gospels work in Faith.
But yet by the preaching of the Gospel, The remedy revealed by the Gospel.
the Spirit further enlighteneth our understanding in a remedy which God in
the riches of his mercy has afforded unto us, and in the benefit thereof. For
the Gospel reuealeth Christ Jesus, who being the true eternal Son of God,
even every God, and so able to bear the infinite wrath of his Father, and
procure his favor, took upon him, into the unity of his person man's nature,
wherein he subjected himself to the Law and both fulfilled the righteousness,
and also underwent the curse thereof.

This is the remedy. The benefit hereof is, that God is reconciled to the
world, his wrath being pacified, his favor procured: that remission of sins,
and deliverance from the punishment thereof, both in this world and in the
world to come, are obtained: that all needful blessings for this temporal
life, all needful graces for a spiritual life, and eternal life and
happiness in the world to come, are purchased.

Without knowledge of these points concerning the forenamed misery, and remedy,
it is impossible for any man to have Faith: and yet may men have, and many have
this knowledge who never attain unto Faith: so as this is not sufficient:
Wherefore the Spirit proceeds further to work upon the will of man.

. 22. Of Grief going before faith.
TWo especial works are wrought upon the will: 2 Man's will wrought upon.
one in regard of man's misery, the other in regard of the remedy,

The first is to be pricked in heart, Grief for sin.
grieved in soul, wounded in conscience, and brought, in regard of any hope in
our selves, or any other creature, even to despair: yea, and to tremble again
within and without, in soul and body for our sins, and the punishment due to
them. Thus were Acts 2. 37.
the Jews pricked in their hearts, and and 16. 29.
the Iaylor so terrified with Gods judgments that he trembled again, and
thereby their hearts were prepared unto Faith.

For the measure of grief it is not alike in all, in some it is greater, in
some smaller: yet in all there must be, as a sight of sin, and of the misery
thereof, so a particular sense of that wretchedness wherein we lie by reason
of it, an utter despair in our selves, true grief of soul, and compunction
of heart for it.

. 23. Of Desire going before Faith.
THe second work is to desire above all things in the World, Desire of mercy.
one drop of the infinite mercy of God, and to be willing to give all that a
man has for Christ, accounting him more worth then all things beside in heaven
and earth, as the Mat. 13. 46.
Merchant in the Gospel esteemed the pearl which he found.

This earnest desire is in Scripture set forth by Luke 1. 53.
hungering, Isa. 55. 1.
thirsting, panting, longing, etc. All which imply a very vehement and
insatiable desire; so as they which have this desire wrought in them, will give
no rest to their souls, till they have some sweet feeling of Gods love to them
in Christ, and some assurance that Christ is theirs: whereupon God who has
offered to satisfy the hungry and thirsty, and to satisfy the desire of such
as pant and long after him, by his Spirit works in such as are so prepared,
such an inward assent of mind, and credence unto the promises of the Gospel,
that particularly they apply them unto themselves, and gladly accept the free
offer of God, and so receive Christ with all his benefits. This is that only
ordinary means, and the order thereof, which God for his part has set down
to work faith in man.

. 24. Of man's endeavor to get Faith.
THe means required on man's part, are next to be declared. Here I will show
what man must do that he may believe: and what motives there be to stir him
up to believe.

Two things are to be done of man: one that to his uttermost power he use and
well employ that ability, What man must do to believe.
whatsoever it be, that he has by nature or special gift.

Because God in wisdom has appointed the preaching of his word, to be the
means of working Faith, man must diligently use that means, and constantly
attend thereupon, not giving over till he find the blessed work of Faith
wrought in him. A natural man may go to Church, and with his outward ear
hearken to the Word, and wait upon it. And because prayer is a means to move
God to give his Spirit, and thereby to open man's heart to receive the Word into
it, and to make his word powerful and effectual, he must also as well as he
can, pray to God for his Spirit, and for his blessing on his Word. For a
natural man may pray, though not in Faith; and God does often hear the desire
of such, as he hears Job 39. 3.
the young Ravens when they cry for want of their meat.

The other, Act. 7. 1.
that we resist not any motion of Gods Spirit, like the rebellious Jews, nor
put off from us the promises of the Gospel, as if they belonged not unto us,
and think our selves unworthy of eternal life.

. 25. Of Gods offering Christ.
FOr motives to make a man bold to apply unto himself the promises of the
Gospel, Motives to believe.
there are none at all in himself; he must clean go out of himself, and
duly weigh these three points, 1 The author of the promises of the Gospel. 2
The cause of the promises of the Gospel. 3 The extent of the promises of the
Gospel.


For the first: 1 It is God that made the promise of the Gospel.
It is God that made the promises: he it is that makes offer of Christ Jesus,
and in him of all things belonging to life and happiness. Ioh. 3. 16.
GOD so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, etc. With what
face may the creature refuse to receive that which his Creator offers? Now
that we may not doubt, but be assured that he will make his word good, we are
especially to consider two properties of God. 1. His Power, 2. His Truth.

The one shows, that he is able to do what he has promised.

The other, that he will not fail to do it.

. 26. Of Gods Power to make his offer good.
NO question can justly be made of Gods almighty Power: 2. God is able to
perform his word. Nemo de Deo optime existimat, qui non eu^ omnipotentem,
atque ex nulla part communicabilem credit. Aug. de lib. arb. l. 1
for the Scripture expressly says; With God shall nothing be impossible. (Luke
1. 37.) All things are possible to him. (Mar. 10. 27.) Which is to be noted
against our deadness, dullness, and untowardness to believe, in regard
whereof we may think that a man naturally dead, may as easily eat and drink
as we believe: but when we consider the Power of Gods might, how Man 3. 9.
he is able of stones to raise up children unto Abraham; we may well think
Eze. 36. 26.
that he is able to take away our stony heart, and give us an heart of flesh.
Abraham looked to Gods power, and thereby was moved to believe that God would
perform his promise, though I saacke in whom the promise was made, were to be
sacrificed; Romans 4 Heb. 11.
He did not doubt of the promise, being fully assured that he which had
promised, was also able to do it.

This motive taken from Gods almighty Power, is in Scripture often used to stir
up men and women to believe the promises of God. It was used to Genesis 18. 14.
Sarah, to the Luke 1. 37.
Virgin Mary, to Ier. 32. 27.
Jeremiah, and to the Mar. 10. 27.
Disciples of Christ. And it is the rather to be thought of, because we are
very prone by nature to make doubt thereof: for albeit in our judgments we
are well persuaded of Gods Omnipotency, and with our mouths can profess as
much; yet when we are in great straits, brought to a pinch, and see no ordinary
means for the effecting the thing which we desire, then we think that God
himself is not able to do it: like 2 Kin. 7. 2.
the incredulous Prince; and not he only, but the Psalm. 78. 19. 20.
unbelieving Israelites also, though they had been long nurtured under Gods
special government, and seen many of his marvelous works; yea, Number. 11.
12. 22.
Moses himself was subject hereunto.

. 27. Of Gods truth in making good his offer.
NO more question can be made of Gods truth, then of his power: 3 God is true,
and will perform his promises.
for he is Psalm. 31. 5.
the Lord God of truth, Iam. 1. 17.
with him is no variableness, nor shadow of turning: Ti^us 1. 2.
He cannot lie, Heb. 6. 18.
it is impossible that he should: for 1 These. 5. 24.
faithful is he which promises; the Gospel in which his promises are made,
(...) Ephe. 1. 13.
the word of truth: his Son who declares them, Reu. 3. 14.
(...) faithful and true witness: His Spirit which seals them up, Ioh. 14.
17.
a Spirit of Truth.

This truth of God is to be meditated of, in regard of the greatness of Gods
promises: for when man hears of Christ, and all his benefits offered in the
Gospel, he will be ready to think and say; Oh here are sweet and excellent
promises, but they are too good to be true, I fear they are too great to be
performed. But if that man remember how faithful and true God is that made
them, it will make him think again, and say; though they were much greater,
yet God who is able, assuredly will not fail to perform what he has promised.

. 28. Of Gods free offer.
^ FOr the cause whereby God is moved to offer Christ and all his benefits, 4
Gods goodness moved him to make his promises to man.
it was his own goodness, and nothing else. Now there are two things which
do highly commend Gods goodness. First, the freeness of his grace. Secondly,
the riches of his mercy.

Gods grace is every way so free, 5 Gods grace is free.
that the goodness which he shows to his creature is altogether of himself
and from himself. Ioh. 3. 16.
God so loved the world, that he gave, etc. Romans 5. 10.
When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God. Genesis 3. 15.
When there was none to mediate for us, God offered grace, and gave his Son
to be a Mediator.

This is to be noted against man's unworthiness, for he is ready to look down
upon himself, and say; Ah, I am too too unworthy to partake of Christ: what
can there be in me to move God to beftow his Son on me? and thus keep
himself from believing. But if we consider that God respects his own
goodness, and not ours in giving us his Son; and that his grace is every way
free, that conceit of our unworthiness, can be no just impediment to Faith.

. 29. Of the Riches of Gods Mercy.
AS for the Riches of Gods Mercy, 6 Gods mercy is abundant.
they are unutterable, inconceivable: I may well cry out, and say; Oh the
deepenesse of them! how unsearchable are they, and past finding out? According
to Gods greatness, so is his mercy, it is infinite, and Psalm. 108. 4.
reaches above the Heavens: so as God may well be said Ephe. 2. 4.
to be rich in mercy, and Exo. 34. 6.
abundant in goodness.

This is to be noted against the multitude, and haynousnesse of our sins;
which because they are innumerable and infinite, keep many men from believing
the pardon of them. But the consideration of the infiniteness of Gods mercy,
which is as an Ocean, sufficient to swallow them all up, though they were more,
and greater then they are, will uphold us against that temptation: for no sin
can be greater then Gods mercy: Mat. 12. 31, 32.
The sin against the Holy Ghost, is not therefore unpardonable, because it is
greater then Gods mercy; Genesis 4. 13.
Greater then can be pardoned, as Cain desperately thought of his sin; but
because the heart of him who commits it, is incapable of mercy: as if a
ventlesse vessel be cast into the Sea, Simil.
it cannot take in one drop of water, not because there is not water enough in
the Sea to fill it, but because it has never a vent to receive water.

. 29. Of the extent of Gods offer of Christ.
3 FOr the extent of the offer of Christ, 7 Gods promises are offered to all.
it is so large, so general, as no person can have any just cause to think
himself exempted. The Angel that brought this glad tidings from Heaven, said;
That it was for Luke 2. 10.
all people. Ioh. 1. 6. 7
The man that was sent from God for a witness, bare witness of the light,
that all men through him might believe. When Christ sent his Apostles forth to
preach the Gospel, he bid them Mat 28. 19.
Go, and teach all Nations: And to show that no particular man in any Nation
was excepted, but every mothers child included, Mar. 16. 15.
Saint Mark setting down the same commission, expresses every creature;
meaning every reasonable creature.

I will not here stand to discuss this question, whether the sound of the
Gospel has been heard in every corner of the world, or no: it is sufficient
for our present purpose to know, that whersoeuer the sound thereof co^eth, there
by the ministry of it, tender and offer is made to every soul, of Christ and
all his benefits, even as when the Number. 21. 8.
brazen serpent was lift up, a remedy was afforded to all that looked upon it.
Ioh. 3. 14, 15
Christ resembles this brazen serpent to himself, and makes this very
application thereof. God herein deals with the world, as a King (against whom
his whole kingdom, even all his subjects have risen up, and rebelled) who
causes a general pardon to be proclaimed to all, and every one that will lay
down their weapons, and accept pardon.

This universal offer of Christ, The general offer of Christ a means to draw
all to receive Christ
is an especial means to draw a poor sinner to receive Christ: and it is to
be noted against the last bar, wherewith men use to keep their hearts close
shut from entertaining Christ: for when they be brought to acknowledge that God
is able to perform all his promises; that he is faithful, and will perform
them: that it is not man's unworthiness that keeps him from showing favor
unto man, but that his own goodness moves him thereunto, yea that the number
and weight of many sins cannot damme up, and keep back the euer-flowing
streams of his mercy, they will object and say,

We know not whether we are any of those persons to whom the promises of the
Gospel are intended, Object.
and for whom Christ indeed dyed. But for answer hereunto,

1 I exhort such to learn of God by hearing him, Answer.
and using his means how to know

. 30. That the offer of Christ, is asufficient ground to receive Christ.
2 OF such I would demand what further ground they would have to receive
Christ, then this, that God offers Christ unto them? would thou (whosoever
thou art that disputest against God, and against thine own soul) would
thou climb up into Heaven, and enter into Gods secret closet, where his
records are, to set whether thy name be written in the book of life or not and
then if it be, believe? what a preposterous conc^^ is this, directly thwarting
the unsearchable wisdom of God? God has reserved his eternal counsel,
concerning the election of men, as a secret unto himself; yet has he ordained
and revealed means unto the sons of men, by the right using whereof, they may
come to 2 Pet. 1. 10.
make their election sure: God has also said, Deuteronomy 29. 29.
that Secret things belong unto himself, revealed things to us. Now mark the
preposterous course of these men; curious they are, and ouer-curious in that
which is secret, but ouer-carelesse in that which is revealed. If this be not
to oppose ma^s shallow brain to the bottomless depth of Gods wisdom, I know
not what is. Had it not been notorious folly for any of the Israelites to have
lien burning with the (...) of the fiery serpents till they had dyed, refusing
to look on the brazen serpent, and said, when I know that the serpent was
lifted up for me, I will look upon it? Did not the very lifting up of the
serpent show that it (...) Gods will they should look on it, and looking be
cured so God causing Christ to be lift up by preaching of the Gospel before
thee, shows that he would thou should deft believe, and believing have life
everlasting.

. 31. That a man's unworthiness ought not to keep him from believing.
SAy not therefore, I can see nothing in my self why Christ should belong to
me. Object.


I told thee before, that thou must clean go out of thy self, and look upon
God. Answer.


But for thy further satisfaction herein, let me demand two things of thee.

First, whether any man before he believed, saw any thing in himself why
Christ should rather belong to him then to any other. Quest. 1.
The Scripture says, Romans 3. 33.
There is no difference, for all have sinned, and are deprived of the glory of
God. What then? Would thou be singular, and have a ground of Faith proper
and peculiar to thy self? Is not this a spice of vainglory? would thou not
have something to boast in?

Secondly, whether thou see any thing in thy self why thou should not
believe? Quest. 2.
The offer of Christ is universal to all. Who separateth thee? Object not
thine unworthiness: for who is worthy? nor the multitude and grieuousnesse of
thy sins: for he that has fewest and least, has burden enough to press him
down to the lowest pit of hell, if God be not merciful unto him. But tell me,
is the number and weight of thy sins an heavy burden unto thee? do they
grieve and vex thy soul? art thou pressed down with them? Lo here is a
motive to make thee believe. This is an evidence that thou art one of those to
whom Christ is given: for Christ after peculiar manner inuiteth such to come
unto him, saying, Mat. 11. 28.
Come unto me all ye that are laden and weary, and I will ease you. For Luke 5.
32.
he came to call sinners and thereupon the Apostle with a vehement asseueration
auerreth this point, Tim. 1. 15.
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners.

. 32. Of long waiting.
Object. But many with heavy hearts have long waited upon the means, and
diligently attended to the Word, and yet find no faith wrought in them.

Answ. We may not prescribe any time to God: as he works on whom he will, so
he works when he will: Hab. 2. 3.
Though he tarry, wait: Heb. 10. 37.
for yet a very little while, and he that shall come, Est animi generosi
perdurare quo ad Deus misereatur nostri. Cries. parad Theod.
will come, and will not tarry. God never failed any that continued to wait on
him, At length he satisfied their longing. Remember Ioh. 5. 5. etc.
the history of that poor diseased man that lay so long at the poole of
Bethesda: at length his desire was effected, he was cured.

Let me therefore (in the name of Christ Jesus) provoke every one before whom
Christ is lift up in the Ministry of the Word, and administration of the
Sacraments, to look upon him, and to persuade themselves that he belongs
unto them, and so receive him into their hearts, and believe.

Neither let them say, Object.
that if Christ should not belong to them, Answer.
they sin in believing: for boldly I say again if any upon the forenamed
grounds believe, None sin in believing.
they finne not: no man can sin in believing (in presuming, he may sin,
but there is a great difference betwixt Faith and presumption, as we shall. 88.
hereafter show) Ioh 3. 18.
He that believes shall not be condemned, 1 Ioh. 5. 10.
He has the witnesse^^ himself: So that in believing he sins not. But
whosoever believes not, refuses and rejects Christ, (...) they Mat. 22. 3,
5, 6.
who were invited to the marriage of the Kings for and did not come.

. 33. Of man's sin in not believing.
Object. FAith is not in man's power. How then can a man sin in not believing?

Answ. How man sins in not believing.
1 God gave ability to man (when he created him after his own image) to lay
hold on any promise that at any time God should make unto him: so as God gave
him power to believe. But man through his own default disabled himself. May
not God justly exact what he gave?

2 No unbeliever does what lies in him to believe: but fails in some thing
that he might do. To omit those among whom the sound of the Gospel came not,
(because now we have not to do with them:) Mat. 22. 6.
Some persecute or Acts. 2. 13.
scoff at the Ministry of the Gospel: Acts 13. 45. 1 Cor: 1: 23.
some speak against the means it self, counting it foolishness: Luke 14. 18.
some are careless in coming to it, pretending many vain excuses: Mat. 3. 7.
some come for company, or other by-respects: and 13. 19,
some attend not though they come: 21,
some soon let slip what they hear: 22.
some let the things of this world choke that which they hear: in something
or other all they which believe not come short of that which they might have
done, for attaining unto this precious gift of Faith. And that is it for which
another day they shall be condemned.

3 Unbelief is in a man's power: who distrust and gainsay the promises of the
Gospel, do it of their free will: they wittingly and wilfully refuse and
reject the gracious offer of Christ Jesus. Mark what Christ says of
Jerusalem, Mat. 23. 37:
How often would I have gathered thy children together, and ye would not?

. 34. Of the heinousness of Incredulity.
THus we see that no unbelievers can have just excuse for themselves:
Incredulity a grievous sin.
their Incredulity is truly and properly a sin; yea, it is a most grievous
sin: heinous against God, and dangerous unto man.

As Faith of all graces does most honor God, 1 Dis^honourable to God.
so this of all vices does most dishonor him. It impeacheth the forenamed
properties of God, namely Psalm. 78. 19, 20.
his power, as if God were not able to make good his promise: 1 Ioh. 5. 10.
his truth, as if God were unfaithful, yea, a plain liar, as the Apostle
speaks: Genesis 4. 13.
his mercy, as if it were dried up with the heat of men's sins, and his Psalm.
10 4, 5.
presence in every place, as if he were not ever by us. It makes a man fly
from God as Genesis 3. 8.
Adam did, and contemn his gracious offer of pardon, as desperate rebels and
debtors: it makes Christ to have dyed in vain: yea it is accompanied with a
kind of obstinacy, as in Thomas who said, Ioh. 20. 25.
I will not believe it.

In regard of men, 2 Dangerous to men.
no sin so deadly and dangerous; it stops the current of Gods mercy, it
barreth up heaven gates against men, Filios Diaholi infide litas facit. quod
peccatum proprium vocatur, quasi solum sit, etc. Aug. cont. ep. Pelag. lib. 3.
c. 3
and opens the mouth of hell for them, and makes them Satan's vassals.
Whereas Faith brings an absolution for all sins, this lays all our sins
open to the wrath of God. The truth is, Ion. 3. 18.
He that believes not is condemned already: and why? because he believes not
in the Son of God. God has made offer of his Son, but he will not receive
him. Is not this to reject Christ, and to judge ones self Act. 13. 46.
unworthy of eternal life? Wherefore to conclude this point, seeing there is
so good ground to believe, and that not to believe is so heinous a sin, let
none dare to distrust, or to put off from him the promises of the Gospel: we
may have a godly ieaiealousie over our selves, and use a conscionable care in
trying the truth of our Faith, (as after I will show;) but to reject the offer
which God makes of Christ, we may not dare: if we feel not Faith wrought in
us, we must wait till we feel it.

. 35. Of proving Faith.
THus we see how Faith may be gotten: V. Point. The trial of Faith.
the next point is to show how it may be proved. We have heard how precious a
thing Faith is: it does therefore greatly behoue us thoroughly to try our Faith,
whether it be sound or no. Simil.
If a man go to buy a gold chain, he will not be deceived with a fair
glittering show, but he will have it touched with the touchstone again and
again: but 1 Pet. 1. 7.
Faith is much more precious then gold that perishes.

. 36. Whether Faith may be known or no.
BEfore I show how Faith may be proved, Faith may be known.
it will be needful by way of preparation and prevention, to declare whether a
Christian can know if he have sound true Faith or no: for, many conceit that it
is sufficient to have a good hope (as they speak,) imagining that no man can
say certainly he has a true Faith. If this were so, in vain it were to seek
how it may be proved, who will labor to prove that which cannot be found out?
But against that conceit I avouch, that The true believer may know that he has
a true and found Faith. For the Saints have professed as much: Psalm. 116. 10
I believed says David. Ioh. 6. 69.
We believe and know, say the disciples: and 2. Tim. 1. 12.
S. Paul says, I know whom I have believed.

. 37. Whether ordinary persons may know they have Faith.
Object. THose were extraordinary persons, and had this knowledge of their
Faith, by extraordinary revelation.

Answ. The Act. 8. 37.
Eunuch, and the Ioh. 9. 38.
blind man knew as much, and yet were no extraordinary persons. But to show
that this knowledge came not of any extraordinary revelation, proper to
extraordinary persons, the Apostle speaking of that spirit which David had,
says, 2 Cor. 4. 13.
We have the same spirit of Faith, etc. Paul had the same spirit that David
had, and other Christians the same that he, whereby they might discern their
Faith, and therefore he uses the plural number, We have the same spirit, etc.
yet more expressly he says, 1 Cor. 2. 12.
We have received the spirit that is of God, that we may know the things which
are given us of God. Is not Faith one of those things? yea, it is one of the
most principal of them? Upon this ground the Apostle exhorts us, 2 Cor. 13.
5.
to prove our selves whether we are in the Faith, etc. In vain were this
exhortation, if Faith could not be discerned and proved.

. 38. Of the difference betwixt those who seem to have Faith, and those who
indeed have it.
1 Object. THe heart of man is deceitful above all things, who can know it?
Ier. 17. 9.
how then can the truth of any grace be discerned?

Answ. In natural and wicked men, there is a Psalm. 12. 2.
double heart, whereby it comes to be deceitful: but the faithful have Isa.
38. 3.
a single, simple, honest, upright, perfect heart.

2 Object. Many presume of what they have not: yea, very hypocrites go so
far, as they can hardly, if at all be discerned. Many of them do more
resemble the faithful, then counterfeit coin does current money: for herein
the Devil helps man's wit. Judas was not discerned by the Disciples, till
Christ discovered him. Though they which have no faith, may be deceived, yet
they which indeed have it, may discern it.


Answer. If that which is counterfeit coin be thoroughly tried, if it be brought
to the touchstone, if clipped through, if melted, it will be discerned: so
hypocritical Faith. But suppose some be so (I know not what to say) cunning or
simple, that they deceive others and themselves; yet thereupon it follows
not, that he which indeed has faith, should be deceived, because he which has
it not, is: A man which dreameth that he eats and drinks, Isa. 29 8. Simil.
may for the time strongly be conceited that he does so, and yet be deceived:
Can not he therefore which is awake, and in deed eats and drinks, know that
he does so? He that wants a thing, groundeth his conceit upon mere shows
and shadows: but he that has that which he is persuaded he has, groundeth
his persuasion on sure, sound, real evidences.

Object. 3. Many which indeed have faith, make a great doubt and question of
it, yea, they think and say, They have no faith at all. How then can Faith be
known?

Answer. That is through men's own weakness, Though in a temptation a man
doubt, yet out of it he may have assurance.
or through the violence of some temptation. When they are strengthened, and the
temptation removed, that doubting will be dispelled. But it follows not,
because at some times, some persons are so exceeding weak, and so violently
assaulted, that therefore they should never know that they have faith; or that
other which are not so weak, nor so assaulted, should not be able to know
their own faith. Simil.
In natural matters there may be some, who through long sickness, or some
wound, blow, or bruise on their head, know not what they do: Can not therefore
healthy, sound men know? After David had given many evidences of his assurance
of faith, through some temptations he doubted.

. 39. Whether Faith and doubting may stand together.
Quest. CAn then true Faith stand with doubting? True Faith may stand with
doubting.


Answ. Yea, it can: for what the Apostle says of knowledge, may we apply to
other Christian graces, even to the mother of them all, Faith; 1 Cor. 13. 9.
we believe in part: The man that said, Mar. 9. 24.
Lord I believe, yet doubted: for he added, help my unbelief. This doubting
is not of the nature of Faith, but rather contrary unto it, arising from the
flesh which remains in us, so long as we remain in the World: Fidei
praecipua virtus in eo est, vt non ambigas Chrysostom. in Tit. hom. 3.
therefore the more strength Faith gets, the more is doubting driven away.
Yet as the Spirit in truth may be where the flesh is, so in truth may Faith be
where doubting is: but as we must strive to subdue the flesh, so also must we
strive to dispell doubting.

. 40. Of trying Faith both by the causes, and by the effects:
NOw come we to the maine point, How Faith may be proved and known.

For the true trial of Faith, How faith may be proved.
we must consider both the causes, and also the effects of Faith: how it was
wrought, and how it works; and compare these together. Most do send men
only to the effects of Faith, by them to make trial of the truth of them: but
there is an hypocritical Faith, which brings forth many fruits so like true
Faith; and true Faith is often so covered with the clouds of temptations, that
if respect be had only to the effects, counterfeit Faith may be taken for true
Faith; and true Faith may be counted no Faith. The birth therefore and the
growth of Faith must be considered jointly together, and one compared with
another, that they may both of them give mutual evidence one to another, and
so both of them give a joint and sure evidence to a man's soul and conscience
that he is not deceived.

. 41. Of that illumination which causes Faith.
WE are first to begin with the birth of Faith: Note that many differences may
be discerned in the causes of Faith after Faith is wrought, which cannot be
found before faith.
of the means and order of working Faith, I have spoken before: for the proof
of Faith in this respect, we must apply the several points before delivered to
our own Faith, and examine whether it were accordingly wrought: namely,
whether it were grounded on a true illumination of the mind, in regard of man's
misery, and the remedy appointed by God: and of a right disposition of the
heart, both in regard of true grief for sin, and true desire after Christ.

For Illumination, Causes of Faith.
it is not sufficient that we have a general knowledge of the forenamed
misery and remedy, 1. Illumination.
that such and such are all men by nature, that this is the remedy afforded
unto them; but we must have an experimental knowledge of our own woeful
estate, as Saint Paul had, Rom 7. 7, etc
when he set forth his own person as a pattern of a miserable man, 1 Timothy 1.
13.
and in particular reckoned up his own particular grievous sins: this is it
which will drive a man to Christ: if at least we also understand that the
remedy is such an one as may bring redemption unto our selves.

It is more clear then needs be proved, that what Faith soever ignorant men,
men that live in neglect, and contempt of Gods Word, make show of, has not so
much as a show of sound Faith, but is palpably counterfeit: therefore this
first point may not be left out in the trial of Faith.

. 42: That Grief goes before Faith.
FOr the disposition of the heart, 2 Compunction and grief of heart.
unless first it have been touched with a sense of man's wretchedness, and
grieved thereat, it is to be feared that the pretense of Faith which is made,
is but a mere pretense: for God heals none but such as are first wounded.
Mat. 9. 12.
The whole need not a Physician, but they that are sick. Luke 4. 18
Christ was anointed to preach the Gospel to the poor, to heal the brok^^
hearted, etc.

Object. Many have believed that never grieved for their misery, as Acts 16. 14
Lydia, Heb. 11. 31
Rahab, Luke 23. 42
the thief on the cross, and others, of whom no grief is recorded.

Answer. Who can tell that these grieved not? It follows not that they had no
grief, because none is recorded: All particular actions and circumstances of
actions are not recorded; it is enough that the grief of some, as of Acts 2. 37
the Jews, of and 16. 29
the Iaylor, of Luke 7. 38
the woman that washed Christ's feet with her tears, and of others is recorded.

But the grief of the thief is implied both by reproving his fellow, and also
by acknowledging his own guiltiness, Rahab says, Ios. 2. 11
That their hearts melted.

Object. That which is said of Rahab, is said of others also, who believed not.

Answ. Though the same affection be jointly attributed to all, yet it was very
different in the kind, manner, and end thereof. The heart of others melted for
fear of a temporal destruction: it was a worldly sorrow; but hers a godly
sorrow, because she was an aliant from the common wealth of Israel, and out of
the Church of God, and therefore so earnestly desired to be one of them.

Lydia might be prepared before she heard Paul, for she Acts 16. 13, 14.
accompanied them which went out to pray, and she worshipped God: or else her
heart might be then touched when she heard Paul preach. The like may be said
of Acts 10 44. 45.
those which heard Peter when he preached to Cornelius, and of others.
Certain it is that a man must both see and feel his wretchedness, and be
wounded in soul for it, before Faith can be wrought in him. Yet I deny not
but there may be great difference in the manner and measure of greeuing. Some
1 Samuel 7. 6,
draw water, and pour it out before the Lord: Luke 7. 38.
Their heart pours out abundance of tears. Acts 16. 29
Other tremble and quake again with horror. Other long continue in their
grief. Other are so deeply wounded within, that they cannot express it by
outward tears, but are even astonished, as with a wound that bleedeth inwardly.
Other see in what a wretched and cursed estate they lie, and are grieved, and
even confounded that they can grieve no more: yet it pleases God after he
has showed to some their woeful estate through sin, and touched their heart
therewith, (bringing them thereby to loath their own natural estate, to
despair in themselves, and to condemn themselves, utterly renouncing all
confidence in themselves) presently to stir up their hearts to desire and
embrace the sweet promises and consolations of the Gospel.

Faith therefore is not to be judged by the measure, but by the truth of
grief, which may be known by the causes and fruits thereof.

. 43. How Grief which works Faith is wrought.
FOr the causes, Causes of true grief. 1 Gods word works it.
true grief which works Faith, arises,

1 Acts 2. 37.
From the word of God, whereby sin and Gods wrath for the same is discovered.

Object. The and 16. 26, etc.
Iaylor was humbled with an extraordinary judgment.

Answer. No doubt but he had heard the word of God before: for Paul had been
sometime in that City, so as that judgment was but as an hammer to drive into
his heart the nails of Gods word: for it is the proper use of Gods judgments
to beat down the hard and stout heart of man, and so to make him sensibly
apprehend* Gods wrath denounced in his Word against sinners. So* was 2 Chr. 33.
10, 12:
Manasseh brought to apply the threatenings of Gods word to himself by a great
judgment.

2 From despair of all help in our selves, or any other creature: 2 It
arises from despair in our selves.
This made the Jews and Iaylor say; Acts 2. 37, and 16. 30
What shall we do? So long as man retains any conceit of help in himself,
all his misery, and grief for it, will never bring him to Christ.

3. And from sense of Gods disp^easure.
From our wretchedness and vildnesse by reason of sin, whereby God is
offended, and his wrath provoked; as well as from our cursednesse by reason of
the punishment and fearful issue of sin: Thus was the prodigal child
grieved, because he had Luke 15. 18.
sinned against his Father.

. 44. Of the effects which that Grief that causes Faith, brings forth.
Grief thus wrought, brings forth these and such like effects. Effects of
true grief.


1 Ier. 31. 19
Shame for the evil which has been done.

2 A true and through resolution to enter into a new course: Surely they which
came to John and said, Lu. 3. 10, 12, 14.
What shall we do? were thus minded. Romans 6. 21.


3 A renewing of grief, Vbi dolor finitur deficit poenitentia. Aug. de ver.
pen. c. 13.
so often as occasion is offered. True spiritual grief which works Faith, is
never clean dried up, because sin, the cause of it, is never clean taken
away: Thus the grief which breeds Faith continues after Faith is wrought,
though not in the same manner and measure: for before Faith it cannot be mixed
with any true joy, and sound comfort, as it may be after Faith is wrought.

Many who have no better then a temporary Faith, are at first much grieved, and
wounded in conscience; but after they receive some comfort by the promises of
the Gospel, are so iocund and joyful, that they grow secure again, and never
after let grief seize upon them; no, though they fall into such grievous
sins as might justly renew their grief: they put off all with this, That
once they grieved. David, Paul, and many other faithful Saints of God were
otherwise affected, as is evident by those Psalm. 6, 2, 3, and 32, 3, and 51, 1,
etc.
many grievous groans, sighs, and exclamations which are recorded of them.
Romans 7. 24


. 45. Of that Desire which causes Faith.
THe second thing to be examined in the disposition of a man's heart for the
proof of Faith, 3 Desire of Christ.
is the Desire of it after Christ: grief at our misery without desire of the
remedy, is so far from being Faith, that it causes desperation.

That true desire which works Faith may be known, Proofs of true desire.
1. By the Cause, 2. By the Order, 3. By the Quality, 4. By the Fruits, 5. By
the Continuance of it.

1 It is the Gospel, 1. The Cause.
and nothing but it, that can work in man's heart a true desire after Christ:
because by it alone is Christ revealed and offered.

2 It follows upon the forenamed grief for sin, 2 The Order.
and despair of succor in our selves or others. Acts 4. 12.
The Apostle uses this as a motive to stir up men to believe in Christ, that
there is not salvation in any other.

3 It is both an hearty and true desire, 3 The Quality.
and also a vehement and earnest desire. For the first of these, it is not
only an outward desire of the tongue, but an inward desire of the soul: Psalm.
42. 1. 2.
My soul pants, my soul their steth for God, says David. This inward
hearty desire is best known to a man's own self: 1 Cor. 2. 11.
for what man knows the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in
him?

For the second, it is a greater desire then the desire of any other thing can
be. No man so desires any earthly thing, as the poor sinner desires Christ,
if it be a true desire: therefore the Scripture uses such metaphors to set it
forth, as imply greatest ardency, as hungring, thirsting, etc. whereof we have
heard. 23.
before, Number. 23. 10.
Balaams slight wish could be no cause or sign of Faith.

4. 4. The Fruits.
It makes a man careful and conscionable in Mat. 13. 44.
using the means which God has appointed to breed faith, yea, and earnest in
calling upon God to bless those means, and to be merciful unto him, Luke 18.
10. 13.
as the poor Publican did.

5 It still raises up and preserves an appetite after 5. Continuance.
Christ, Long aberit a siti satietas, long a saetietate fastidium, quia
sitientes saturabimur, and satiati sitiemus. Aug. de Spec. c. 29.
even after we have tasted him. Desire after Christ before we believe arises
from that sense we have of the want of Christ: but after we believe, partly
from the sweet taste we have felt of him, and partly from the want we still
feel of him, so as we can never be satisfied. Hereby is the covetous man's true
desire of money manifested, because he can never be filled, but the more he
has, the more he desires An insatiable desire of Christ is a good
covetousness. 1 Pet. 2. 2.
The Apostle exhorts to desire the sincere milk of the Word, to grow
thereby: not once only to taste of it. If ever a man be satisfied with Christ,
and begin to loath him, he never truly believed in him. For first, Christ is
not like corporal meats, which with abundance may cloy the stomach: the more
he is tasted, the better and greater will our appetite be. Secondly; no man in
this world can receive such a measure as to be filled thereby. If therefore a
man desire Faith, and fall away, that seeming desire which he had, never bred
Faith in him.

. 46. Of joining the effects with the causes of Faith, in the trial thereof.
IF upon that forenamed illumination of the mind, and disposition of the
heart, the Spirit of God has drawn us to accept of Christ Jesus tendered in
the Gospel, then has Faith been kindly wrought, and by this manner of breeding
Faith, a man may have good evidence of the truth of it, especially if he also
find that his Faith does kindly work, and bring forth the proper fruits
thereof. For Faith is operative, Faith is operative as fi^e
even as fire. Where fire is, there will be heat, the more fire the greater
heat: if but a little heat, there is a small fire, if no heat at all, surely
no fire. I deny not but fire may be so covered over with ashes, that the heat
will not sensibly appear, but yet heat there is within, so as if the ashes be
removed, the heat will soon be felt: so surely, where true and sound Faith is,
there will be some holy heat, some blessed fruits thereof: it may for a time,
through the violence of some temptation, be so smothered, and suppressed, as it
cannot be discerned, but when the temptation is over, it will soon show it
self: if not, I dare boldly say, there is no true, living, justifying Faith,
but a mere dead Faith. I have my warrant from an holy Apostle, Absit vt
sentiret vas electionis iustificari bominem per fidem etiamsi male vivat, and
opera bona non habeat, Aug. ^de gr. and lib. arb. cap. 7.
so to say, ( Iam. 2. 20, 26.) It is a working Faith, which is the true
justifying Faith; and this is the constant doctrine of our Church, taught in
our Universities, preached in pulpits, published in print by all that treat of
Faith. That which our adversaries object against the orthodoxall and
comfortable doctrine of Justification by Faith alone, (that we make justifying
Faith to be a naked dead Faith, without all good works) is a mere cavil, and
a most malicious slander: for though we teach that in the very act of
justification, Ephe. 2. 8, 9,
Faith only has his work without works: yet we teach not that this Faith is
destitute of all works, but that it is a Faith Act. 15. 9.
which purifieth the heart, and Gal. 5. 6.
works by love. Thus in regard of the office of Faith, we teach as we are
taught by Romans 3. 28.
Saint Paul, that a man is justified by Faith without works: and in regard of
the quality of Faith we teach, as we are taught by Iam, 2. 24.
Saint James, that of works a man is justified (tha^ is, declared so to be)
and not of Faith only. Wherefor^ for the sound proof of Faith, we must have
also recourse to the fruits of it.

. 47. Of the fruits of Faith.
IT were an infinite task to reckon up all the fruits of Faith. For all the
seurall and distinct branches of piety and charity, if they be rightly
performed, are fruits of Faith. Faith is the mother of all sanctifying graces:
for by it we are ingraffed into Christ, and so live the life of God. Every
sanctifying grace therefore is an evident sign of Faith. But that I may keep
my self within compass, I will draw the principal effects of Faith, whereby it
may be best proved, unto two heads. First, a quiet: conscience. Secondly, a
clear conscience. This has respect to that benefit which we receive by Faith:
That to the author thereof.

. 48. Of a quiet conscience proceeding from Faith.
A Quiet conscience is that which excuses a man before God: What is a quiet
conscience.
so far it is from accusing, that it excuses; whence arises an admirable
tranquillity of mind, Nihil eft quod ita voluptatem afferre solet, atque pura
conscientia. Chrys^n. 2 Cor. ho^^. 12.
which the Apostle calls, Phil. 4. 7.
The peace of God which passes all understanding. It is evident that Faith
breeds this: Romans 5. 1.
for being justified by Faith, we have peace toward God. So soon as a sinner
truly believes, he has some peace of conscience: the more his Faith
increases, and the stronger it grows, the more peace he has in his soul.
From Faith then arises this peace, A quiet conscience ari^seth from Faith.
and from nothing else. For it cannot possibly come from any perfection in man.
Indeed Adams conscience in his integrity did excuse him before God, because
there was nothing in him blameworthy: but so could no man's since his fall: for
besides those palpable evil deeds whereunto every man's conscience is priny,
whose conscience can excuse him in the best works that ever he did? Isa. 64. 6.
Is not all our righteousness as filthy clouts? this David well knew, when he
thus prayed, Psalm. 143. 2.
Enter not into judgment, etc. but Faith (assuring the conscience, that 1 Ioh,
2. 1, 2
We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, that he is
the propitiation for our sins, purging our souls with his own most precious
blood) pacifieth it: so that where this peace of conscience is, there must be a
true justifying Faith.

. 49. Of the difference betwixt a quiet conscience, and a not-troubling
conscience.
Object. THe conscience of many wicked men lies quiet, and troubles them not.

Answ. No wicked ma^^ consci^ence can be quiet.
Their conscience is improperly said to be quiet: it is either a slumbring
conscience, which though for a time it seem to lie quiet, yet when it is
awaked and roused up, it will rage and rave like a fierce, cruel, wild beast,
Mar. 27. 5.
as Judas his conscience did: or else (which is worse) a seared and dead
conscience, which will drown men in perdition and destructiou, before they be
aware of it. 1 Timothy 4. 2.
Such a seared conscience had the ancient Heretics. Now these two maine
differences there are betwixt these nottroubling consciences, and that quiet
conscience. First, they only accuse not: this also excuses. Secondly, they
lie still only for a time, at the uttermost for the time of this life:: this
is quiet for ever, even at the bar of Christ's judgment Seat.

. 50. Of the difference betwixt conscience excusing, and not-accusing.
2 Object. MAny wicked men in doing evil, Acts 26. 9:
have thought they ought to do so: yea that Ioh. 16. 2.
they did God good service therein: their conscience therefore must needs
excuse them.

Answ. Nothing so: for, because they had no sure warrant out of Gods Word for
that which they did, their conscience could not excuse them: only it accused
them not, and that by reason of the blindness of their judgment. It remains
therefore to be a proper work of Faith, gounded on the Gospel, the word of
Truth, to cause a quiet conscience.

. 51. Of Security arising from a quiet conscience.
FRom this quiet conscience proceed two blessed fruits, which are likewise
effects of Faith, and sure tokens thereof. First, an holy security of mind.
Secondly, a spiritual joy of heart.

For the first; Holy security.
a believer having in his conscience, peace with God, rests secure for
salvation, and for all things that make thereunto, so as with Psalm. 4 8.
David he may say, I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep, etc. This
security is ^in regard of the issue, not of the means. For herein lies the
difference betwixt the godly and worldly security: to be secure and careless
in using the means of salvation, which God in wisdom has appointed, is a
carnal, sinful security: but to rest on God for a blessing on the means, and
to be secure for the event, is an admirable work of Faith. This is that 1 Pet.
5. 7.
casting of our care and Psalm. 55. 22.
burden on God, and and 37. 5.
resting upon him, which the holy Ghost often urges: they only who by Faith
have received Christ, and have their consciences quieted through his blood, can
thus securely cast themselves upon God: well and fitly therefore said
Ieho^aphat, 2 Chr. 20. 20.
Believe in the Lord ^our God, so shall ye be established.

. 51. Of joy arising from a quiet conscience.
FOr the second, Spiritual joy.
that spiritual joy is an effect of Faith following upon peace of conscience,
the Apostle shows: for he joins them together, and says, Rom, 5. 1, 2.
Being justified by Faith, we have peace toward God, etc. and rejoice. It is
noted of the Eunuch, that after he believed, and in testimony thereof was
baptized, Act. 8. 39.
he went away rejoicing: and of the Jailer that and 16. 34.
he rejoiced, that he with all his household believed in God: and of the
faithful Jews, that 1 Pet. 1. 8.
they believed and rejoiced with joy unspeakable and glorious. This joy
arises from Faith, in regard of that benefit which Faith brings with it,
which is no less then Christ himself, and in, and with him, all things
needful unto full and complete happiness: so that we may well conclude, where
true spiritual joy is, there is true justifying Faith.

. 52. Of the difference betwixt the joy of the upright, and hypocrite.
Object. MAny Luke 8. 13 Ioh. 5. 35.
that have no better then a temporary Faith, have great joy wrought thereby in
their hearts.

Answ. The joy of hypocrites not sound.
Their joy is no true, sound, solid joy, but a mere shadow and show thereof,
which is evident both by the birth, and also by the death of it. The birth is
too sudden to be sound: that which suddenly sprouteth up, can have no deep
rooting: Mat. 13. 20.
Christ fitly compares such joy to corn sown in stony ground.

The death of it is irreconerable, it clean dries up, and utterly vanishes
away, which, if it had substance, it would never do: therefore Job 20. 5. Mat.
13. 21
the Scripture makes it a property of an hypocrites joy to be but for a
moment: as dew vanishes away by the Sun, so may their joy by persecution.

True spiritual joy which arises from Faith, Notes of spiritual joy.
is wrought by degrees: Fidelis etst timet a iudice, sperat a saluatore, cum
iam in animo eius timor and loetitia obequitent and obuient sibi. Bern in reg.
Not Dom. se^m.
for it follows after a continual affection, namely sorrow; they that mourn
shall be comforted, ( Mat. 5. 4.) As sorrow is lessened by Faith, so is joy
increased: but yet always there remains a mixture of grief and joy, because
there still remains in man cause of mourning and rejoicing, namely, the flesh
and the spirit.

Yet this joy is so fast rooted on a sure ground, which is Christ apprehended
by a true and lively Faith, that it continues for ever, and never utterly
vanishes away. It may be obscured by temptation, as the shining of the Sun
by a cloud: but as light can never be taken from the Sun, so joy never
utterly severed from Faith: he that can and will perform it, has said it,
Ioh. 16. 22.
Your joy shall no man take away from you. Such is the power of Faith which
breeds this joy, that the heat of afflictions cannot dry it up, but often
times it causes it to grow and increase: for Romans 5. 3.
we rejoice in tribulations. Acts 5. 41
The Apostles rejoiced because they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for
Christ's Name. The Heb. 10. 34
Hebrews suffered with joy the spoiling of their goods. This has in all ages
been verified in many Martyrs.

. 53. Of Faith when the fruits of it appear not.
Quest. What if a man cannot find in him these effects of Faith, as peace of
conscience, security of mind, joy of heart, has he then no true Faith at all?

Answ. I dare not so pronounce: for true believers may be much troubled in
their mind, Faith sometimes as a tree in winter.
fearful of their estate, full of grief and mourning, and seem to be, far
from those forenamed signs, both in the beginning, while Faith is as it were
in the bud, and also in the time of temptation, as it were in winter time. But
yet there may be observed in such persons, an inward panting and breathing
(which are signs of life*) namely, a groaning and greeuing that they want those
fruits of Faith, and an earnest desire of them.

Such weak ones are to have recourse to the causes of their Faith, and thereby
to support themselves till the winter season be passed over, and till it please
the Lord to vouchsafe unto them a pleasant spring, wherein their Faith, may
send forth the forenamed fruits: yet in the mean while let them observe such
fruits of Faith as usually are in the weakest, namely, love of God, and Gods
children, desire and endeavor to please God, and fear to offend him, with the
like, which are branches of a clear conscience.

. 54. Of a clear conscience proceeding from Faith.
BY a clear conscience I mean Acts 24. 16. Heb. 13. 18.
a faithful endeavor to approve our selves unto God: What is a clear
conscience.
and that on the one side by doing that which is pleasing and acceptable unto
him: and on the other by avoiding that which is offensive to his excellent
Majesty, and greeueth his good Spirit.

This proceeds from Faith, and that in a double respect.

1 Because Faith is the instrument whereby we draw all that virtue and grace
from Christ our head, which enableth us to keep a good conscience: I live
(says the Apostle, meaning a spiritual life) By the Faith of the Son of God.

2 Because it assures us of Gods love and kindness to us, and thereby
persuades and even provoke us in all good conscience to serve him: the
Apostle therefore who said, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, adds,
who loved me, etc. whereby he implies that the love of Christ made known to
him, moved him to live that spiritual life: for when a sinner once believes
that God has indeed so loved him, as to give his only begotten Son for him,
his heart is so affected, as Psalm. 116. 10, 11.
David's was, thinking what to render unto God; but finding nothing to give, he
seeks what may please God, and sets himself in way of thankfulness to
do that, (as faithful Heb. 11. 5.
Enoch who had this testimony that he pleased God,) being very fearful to
offend him, (as faithful Genesis 39. 9.
Joseph, who being tempted to do evil, said, How shall I do this and sin
against God?) This clear conscience being a proper work and fruit of Faith,
must needs be a sure note and evidence thereof: 1 Timothy 1. 5.
which the Apostle implies by joining them together. They who indeed have a
good conscience, have a sweet, sensible and powerful proof of the truth of
their Faith. I will therefore a little longer insist upon this point, and
distinctly show,

1 What is the ground or fountain of a clear conscience.

2 What the inseparable properties thereof are.

3 What the extent of it is.

These points I will the rather note out, because they are further evidences
and proofs of Faith.

. 55. Of love arising from Faith.
THe groundwork of a clear conscience is love: Love the ground of a clear
conscience.
for Faith gives assurance of Gods love: a sense of Gods love works love to
God: as fire causes heat, so love causes love, 1 Ioh. 4. 19.
We love God, because he loved us first. And this love stirs us up to
endeavor to have a clear conscience before God. I may not unfitly resemble
Faith, love, and a clear conscience, to the sap, bud, and fruit of a tree:
Ioh. 15. 5.
the tree is Christ, the several branches are particular Christians: the sap
which runs through all the several branches, and is the very Hab. 2. 4. Gal.
2, 20.
life of them, is the Spirit: that which receives and conueyeth the sap into
every branch is Faith: the budde which first sprouteth out, is Gal. 5. 6.
Love: the fruit which comes out of that bud, and manifests all the rest,
is that clear conscience which now we speak of: both fruit and budde spring
out of the sap; yet the fruit comes immediately out of the bud: so both love
and a clear conscience come from Faith, but a clear conscience immediately
from love. Our love to God is it which makes us careful to please him,
fearful to offend him. Wherefore first make trial of Faith by love: for
mark what Christ said of the poor penitent sinner, Luke 7. 47.
Many sins are forgiven her, for she loved much. What? was her love the cause
of the forgiveness of her sins? No: it was a fruit, a sign, a proof
thereof: her sins being forgiven, and the pardon of them revealed to her
heart and conscience, she loved Christ, and in testimony of her love washed,
wiped and kissed his feet. 1 Ioh 4. 19.
We love God because we are first loved: yea because the Romans 5. 5.
love of God is first shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, whereby we
have a sense of Gods love to us. Now because God who cannot be seen, has left
us a visible image of himself, even our brother, whom he has set in his own
steed, therefore our love to God moves us also to love our brother, and so
Act. 24. 16.
endeavor to keep a clear conscience before God and men. 1 Ioh. 3. 17. and 4.
20.
Saint John does much press the love of our brother, as an evident fruit and
sign of our love to God. Love of our brother, a note of the weakest faith.
Among other notes of true Faith, this especially is to be observed, as a
trial of the weakest Faith: when other notes fail, this may stand a poor
Christian in great steed. The Faith of many is so weak, that it does not
pacifi^ their conscience, nor breed any joy in them, yet it works love: for
ask one who is a weak, yet a true Christian, and finds not in himself a
quiet conscience, spiritual joy, and such like evident testimonies (whereof I
have before spoken, Pia fides fine charitate esse non vult. Aug. epist. 83.
which argues a strong Faith,) ask him if he love God, he will not deny it,
but say, Oh, I love God with all my heart. If he do deny it, further ask, if
he be not grieved for displeasing God, if his desire and endeavor be not to
please him: or yet further ask if he love not such as he is persuaded love
God. Few that are indeed true Christians, and not overwhelmed with some violent
temptations, will deny these. Now these argue a love to God in them, which must
needs prove that they have Gods love in some measure revealed to them, and that
they believe God loves them, though sensibly they discern it not.

. 56. Of a pure heart arising from Faith.
2 THe next thing which argues a clear conscience to be a fruit of Faith, A
clear conscience is always accompanied with a pure heart.
is an inseparable property thereof, namely a pure heart. 1 Timothy 1. 1. 5
These two does the Apostle ^oyne, and that together with Faith and love: ^ea,
2 Cor. 1. 12.
he ^placeth the testimony of a good conscience in simplicity ^and godly
pureness. Now Act. 15. 9.
from Faith comes purity of heart: for Faith has immediate respect to God
alone, who 1 Samuel 16. 7.
sees not as man sees, but Ier. 17. 10.
searches the heart, and tries the reins, and in that respect causes a man
to walk before him in truth, and with a perfect heart: therefore is true Faith
called unfeigned faith: so as he that in truth dares say, Psalm. 26. 1.
Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity, has a good evidence of
Faith.

. 57. Of keeping a good conscience in all things
3 THe last point is concerning the Extent of a clear conscience, which is
without restraint, and that in a double respect,

1 Of the Heb. 13. 18.
matter, in all things.

2 Of the continuance, Act. 24. 16.
always.

The generality of the matter has reference to the rule of a good conscience,
A clear conscience extends it self unto all things.
which is his revealed will, to whom I desire to approve my self, and that is
Gods word. Because I desire to please God, therefore whatsoever I know to be
his will, I endeavor to do. Thus did 1 King. 15 5
David, 2 Kin. 23. 25.
Joseph, Luke 1. 6.
Zachary and Elizabeth, Heb. 13. 18.
Paul, and many other testify their good conscience to Gods word, and thereby
gave proof of their true Faith.

This extent of a good conscience respects rather the integrity of the heart,
then the perfection of the work: for perfection of the work is a full and
perfect fulfilling of all the commandments of God, whereunto none can attain
in this world.

Integrity of heart is a true and equal endeavor to perform them all, and
that though they seem never so contrary to our corrupt humor: for herein lies
a maine difference betwixt Faith unfeigned and hypocritical. The lusts of an
hypocrite rule him, and prevail over his Faith: Mar. 6. 17, etc.
in such things as cross not his lusts, he can be content to obey, but no
further: loath he is to try himself: he endures not that any other should try
him.

But unfeigned Faith controuleth all natural conceits and worldly desires: it
makes both reason and will to yield to Gods word and will: and so makes a man
ready to do whatsoever he knows to be Gods will: yea, it breeds an holy
jealousy of himself (as Job 1. 5.
Job had of his children,) so as he is very careful in examining his heart and
ways, and willing that others should try him, yea, desirous that God would
sift him, and discover such hidden sins and corruptions as himself cannot
find out. Hence it follows, that

1 For sins past, which by his own, or other men's, or the Lords means are
found out and discovered, he is truly humbled, and gives no rest to his soul
till he have some assurance of pardon, as 2 Samuel 12. 13.
David.

2 For the time present, Psalm. 51
because he finds the flesh still remaining in him, he maintains a strife
and fight against sin, as Romans 7. 15 etc.
Paul.

3 For future times he is watchful, that he be not overtaken as in former
times; as Psalm. 119. 11.
David.

To this integrity of heart, a faithful man may attain. It is that which we
daily pray for in the third Petition: it is all that God exacteth: where it is
found, it is a good evidence of Faith. And it is the rather to be noted,
because it is both an encouragement for a Christian to endeavor to do what he
can, knowing that his honest will shall be accepted: and also a comfort against
his manifold infirmities and imperfections, keeping a man from despair.

. 58. Of the Continuance of a good Conscience.
FOr the Continuance, A clear conscience endures to the end.
a clear Conscience which proceeds from a sound Faith, never decaieth, nor
yet stands at a stay: but rather grows and increases: as Reu. 2. 19.
Christ said to the Church at Thyatira, I know thy love, service, faith,
patience, and works, that they are more at the last then at the first. The
Phil. 3. 13. etc.
Apostle says of himself, That he endeavored to that which was before, and
followed hard toward the mark: and thereupon exhorts others to be so minded.
This must needs be a good evidence of Faith, because Faith is that which
receives, and conueigheth in and from Christ such supply of grace, as makes
the believer grow up thereby, John 7. 38.
He that believes in me (says Christ) out of his belly shall flow rivers of
water of life. By their continuance are many which had only a temporary and
hypocritical Faith discovered, who otherwise before they fell away, would
hardly, if at all, have been discerned.

That conscience which is thus grounded on Love, accompanied with sincerity,
and extends it self to all things which are pleasing to God always, is that
good and clear conscience which is so much commended in the holy Scripture: he
that is assured thereof (as the Apostle was, Heb. 13. 18.) has a sensible
evidence of true Faith.

Thus we have heard how Faith may be gotten, and proved.

. 59: Of the issue of overmuch boldness.
THe third point is how it may be preserved: which point is the rather to be
delivered to prevent two extremes, Two extremes
whereinto many are ready to fail. The one is ouer-secure boldness: 1
Ouer-secure boldness.
the other, ouer-childish fearfulness. For when men have gotten and proved
their Faith, some through the pride of flesh are proane to be insolent, and too
much to boast of it: other through their weakness (which also arises of the
flesh) to fear the decay and loss of it.

The ground of the former extreme is, Object.
that Faith is an immortal seed, which shall never clean utterly decay, and
clean fall away. This they know, and are able to prove by testimony of
Scripture, and evidence of reason.

But though this ground be very sound and orthodoxall, Answer.
yet the collection which is made from thence is unsound, and impious: for it
crosses Gods wisdom, who has ordained and revealed means for the preserving
and cherishing of that which he has appointed to continue to the end:
wherefore we are exhorted Phil. 2. 12.
to work out our salvation (though it be 1 Pet. 1. 4.
in Heaven reserved for us) withfeare and trembling. But, to prevent that
illusion, let it be noted, that a man if he make not the better proof of his
Faith, may be deceived, and take counterfeit for current; a temporary Faith for
justifying Faith: which if he do, then his ground fails: for a temporary
Faith may clean dry away, Luke 8. 13.
as the Corn sown in stony ground: witness Acts 8. 13.
Simon Magus, 2 Timothy 4. 10.
Demas, and John 2. 23.
many that believed in Christ. It is likely that they which are ouerbold, never
thoroughly tried the truth of their Faith: for one note of true Faith is an holy
jealousy, lest Faith should decay.

. 60. Of losing Faith.
2 Though true Faith cannot totally and finally fall away, How far the sense
of faith may be lost.
yet it may to their feeling be so far gone, as it will make them with heavy
hearts to repent their proud boldness, and careless security. For,

1 It may be so covered over and smothered, as it cannot be discerned: they can
for the time have no assurance of it.

2 All the joy and comfort of it (wherewith they were formerly vpheld) may be
clean taken away, and they even faint for want of it.

3 No fruits thereof may appear, but they be as trees in winter: little
conscience of any duty, dull in hearing Gods word, cold in prayer, nothing
remaining but a formal profession, if that.

4 Their consciences may prove a very rack, a grievous torture and torment
unto them.

5 It is not like to be recovered with a wet finger, with a light sigh, and a
groan: but they may call, cry, and roar again and again, before they be
heard.

6 When they recover it, it may be they shall never attain to that measure
which once they had: if to that measure of the thing it self, yet not of the
joy and comfort of it: they may carry the grief of this their folly to their
graves.

. 61. Of the grounds of Scripture against secure boldness.
FOr preventing these fearful effects, they who are tempted to this extreme,
must be very watchful over themselves, and seriously meditate of those
premonitions which tend to this purpose, as 1 Cor. 10. 12.
Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. Romans 11. 20
Thou stand by Faith, be not high minded, but fear. Heb. 12. 15
Take heed that no man fall away from the grace of God. and 3. 12.
Take heed lest at any time there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief
in departing from the living God. and 4. 1.
Let us fear lest at any time by forsaking the promise, any of you should
seem to be deprived. Mat. 26. 41.
Watch and prau that ye enter not into temptation. Heb. 10. 38.
If any withdraw himself my soul shall have no pleasure in him. Not without
just cause are these and such like premonitions much urged and pressed by the
Holy Ghost: for well he knows how prone we are to fall away from grace.
Lead, iron, stone, or any other earthy heavy thing, is not more prone to fall
downward, if it be not continually drawn and held up by some means or other;
nor water more subject to wax cold if fire be not kept under it, then we are
to decay in grace, if we be not watchful over our selves, and careful to
use all good means for nourishing and increasing thereof. Besides, we are
subject to many temptations, which are as water to fire; they will soon quench
the Spirit, if we be not the more watchful and careful to stir it up. Yea,
if once we wax secure, selfe-conceited, and ouer-bold, we provoke God to give
us over to Satan, and our own lusts, 2 Samuel 11. 2.
as for a time he gave David over.

. 62. Of the assurance of Faith.
THe ground of the latter extreme is, 2 Ouer-childish fearfulness.
that they feel the flesh in them, they are very weak and prone to fall away;
and many in all times have fallen away.

Answer. Assurance in Christ.
These that are thus tempted, must know that the cause of our assurance is not
in our selves, but in Christ our head; as we lay hold of him, so he fast
holds us: for there is a double bond whereby we are knit unto Christ, one on
Christ's part, the other on ours. That, is the Spirit of Christ: 1 John 4. 13
Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us
of his Spirit. This, is our Faith: for Ephesians. 3. 17.
Christ dwells in our hearts by Faith: Now though our Faith should let go
her hold, yet Christ's Spirit wo^ld not let go his hold. This ground of
assurance the Scripture expressly declares: for says Christ, Ioh. 10. 27. 28.
I know my sheep, I give unto them eternallife, and they shall never perish:
now mark the reason, There shall not any pluck them out of my hand: My Father
which gave them me is greater then all, and none is able to take them out of my
Fathers hand. Wherefore the Devil and all his adherents can do no more, to
put out the light of Faith, and pluck us from Christ, then all Creatures on
Earth can to extinguish the light of the Sun. For why? The Sun from whence
this light comes, is far above all, they cannot come at it: So Christ on
whom our Faith is founded, is far above all our enemies. Christ must be
plucked out of Heaven, if true Faith utterly fall away.

2 Let the forenamed weak ones consider, The power of Christ's Spirit n the
weakest
that as the flesh is in them to make them weak, so also the power of Christ's
Spirit is in them to make them strong. Though the spirit suffer the flesh
sometimes to prevail; it is not because the flesh is stronger then the spirit,
or the spirit weaker then the flesh; but because the Spirit in wisdom will
have us see our weakness, see in what need we stand of the power of God, fly
to God, depend upon him: and at length the Spirit will prevail, and get full
conquest:

3 As for the falls of other, we know not what they were in truth.

. 63. Of the grounds of Scripture for perseverance.
TO be freed from this last temptation, they which are subject thereunto, must
seriously ponder those scriptures which set forth the certainty and
perseverance of Faith; which are such as these, John 5. 24.
He that believes, has everlasting life, and shall not come into
condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. and 4. 14.
He that drinks of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst: but
the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up
into everlasting life. 1 John 5. 4.
This is the victory that overcomes the World, even our Faith. 1 Pet. 2. 6
He that believes on Christ shall not be confounded. Psalm. 125. 1.
They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed,
but abides for ever. The grounds of this stability of Faith are in the
Scripture noted to be these,

1 The constancy of Gods love, mercy, truth, covenant, calling, gifts, and the
like; which is set forth by these, and such like promises as these be: Ier. 31.
3.
I have loved thee with an everlasting love. Isa. 54. 8.
With everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee. 2 Samuel 7. 15
My mercy shall not depart away from him. Psalm. 132. 11
The Lord has sworn in truth, he will not turn from it. Ier. 32. 40.
I will make an everlasting covenant with them. Rom 11. 29.
The calling and gifts of God are without repentance.

2 The perpetual efficacy of Christ's intercession, manifested in one
particular example, which is to be applied to all his Elect: for what he said
to Peter, ( Luke 22. 32.
I have prayed that they Faith fail not) he performs for all.

3 The continual assistance of the Holy Ghost: in which respect it is said,
That John 14. 16.
he shall abide with us for ever, and that Phil. 1. 6.
he which has begun a good work, will finish it. If well we weigh and
apply these and such like testimonies of Scripture, though we work out our
salvation with fear and trembling, yet shall we not be fearful and doubtful
of the issue.

. 64. Of preserving and increasing Faith.
AS a preservative against those two poisonous potions, and as a means to
keep us in the right way from falling into any of the two extremes, diligent
care must be used to preserve and increase this precious gift of Faith: for if
Faith be kept alive, so as it may bear sway in us, it will keep us both from
boasting and doubting.

Two especial points there be which make to this purpose. VI. Point. How Faith
may be preserved and increased.


1 A conscionable and constant use of the means which God to this end has
appointed.

2 Faithful and hearty prayer for Gods blessing on those means.

The means are two. First, the ministry of Gods Word. Secondly, the
administration of the Sacraments.

. 65. Of using the word for increase of Faith.
We have heard before how Faith was bred by the word; 1. By the word
now the word is like to a kind natural mother, which gives suck to the child
which she has brought forth: whereupon says the Apostle, As newborn babes
desire the sincere milk of the word, ^ 1 Pet. 2. 2
that ye may grow thereby. He had said before, That we were and 1. 23.
borne anew by the word of God: Here he shows that the Word has a further
use; namely, to make us grow. For by the Word the promises of God (which at
first were made known unto us, and whereby Faith was bred) are again and
again brought to our remembrance, the tender and offer of them often renewed; so
as thereby our Faith (which otherwise might languish away through our own
weakness, and Satan's temptations) is not only preserved, but exceedingly
quickened, strengthened, and increased.

. 24.
before that we must attend on the Word, till we find Faith wrought in us.

Here we further learn never to give over, but so long as our Faith has need
to be confirmed and increased (which will be so long as we live in this world,)
to use the Word. We may not therefore think it sufficient that we have had
this benefit of the Word to believe: we must labor for a further benefit, to
be established and confirmed thereby more and more in our most holy Faith.

. 66. Of using the Sacraments for increase of Faith.
THe Sacraments are purposely added for this end, 2 By the Sacraments.
to strengthen our Faith, which they do two ways. First, they are Gods Romans
4. 11.
seals added unto his word, that by two immutable things (Gods promise, and
Gods seal) wherein it is impossible that God should lie) we might have strong
confidence. Secondly, they do as it were visibly set before our eyes the
sacrifice of Christ (which is the groundwork of our Faith) so as in, and by
them Jesus Christ is even Gal. 3 1.
crucified among us. Romans 4. 11.
The Apostle notes, that Abram after he believed, received the sign of
circumcision: and withal renders the reason because it was a seal of the
righteousness of the Faith which he had: therefore it served to the
confirmation and preservation of his Faith. To this end Acts 8. 37.
Philip baptized the Eunuch after he believed.



. 67. Of prayer for increase of Faith.
2 PRayer is that means which God has appointed to obtain all grace, 3 By
prayer.
all strength of grace, yea and a blessing upon all his ordinances (as I will
Treat. 3. part. 1.. 20.
after show) so that it must needs in that respect be a notable preservative of
Faith. Besides, by prayer we make our selves after an holy manner familiar
with God, and so have more and more evidence of Gods love and favor to us,
whereby our Faith must needs be much strengthened. When Satan desired to winnow
the Apostles, what means did Christ use to preserve Peter's Faith: Luke ^2. 32.
I have prayed (says he to Peter) for thee that thy Faith fail not. Thereby
Christ also teaches us what we must do to preserve our Faith. After that once
Faith is bred in us, in Faith we may pray that it fail not, but we cannot so
pray to get Faith. A man that hears the sweet promises of the Gospel, and
withal hears that Faith is that means whereby the benefit of them is
received, may earnestly wish for Faith, and desire God to give it him: but in
Faith (which yet he has not) he cannot pray for Faith, as after he has it, he
may for the preservation of it: therefore faithful prayer is a proper means
to cherish, keep, strengthen and increase Faith.

. 68. Of well using Faith.
THe last point observed out of this exhortation is, VII. Point. How faith may
be well used;
How Faith may be well used.

The Apostle does not simply say, Take Faith, but adds this resemblance
shield, saying, Take the shield of faith: teaching us thereby that we must use
Faith as soldiers use their shield. I showed before how soldiers use to hold
out their shields against all the assaults and weapons of their enemies: to
keep themselves safe, they use to lie under their shields, and so cover and
defend their bodies: thus must we shelter our souls by Faith, holding it out
against all spiritual assaults, and (as I may so speak) lie even under it.
Faith is used as a shield by resting on gods promises
This in general is done by resting on Gods promises, which are the
groundwork and rock of our Faith. For by true Faith we do not only give
credence to the truth of Gods promises, but also trust to them, and build upon
them, assuring our selves that they shall be effected to our good, and 2 Chro.
20. 20
so remain secure whatsoever fall out.

This use is to be made of Faith, both in prosperity, and in adversity.

. 69. Of the use of Faith in prosperity.
IN prosperity Faith has a double use.

1 It makes us acknowledge that it is the Lord which has so disposed our
estate, Two uses of faith in prosperity.
1 King. 8. 20. 24.
as Solomon did, saying, The Lord has made good his word, etc.

For Faith having an eye to the promises of God, and exercising it self about
them, when any good thing falls out, it attributes and applies it to such
and such a promise, and so acknowledges it to be brought to pass by the word
and providence of God.

2 Faith makes us rest upon God for the time to come, that all shall go well
with us, Psalm. 16. 5. etc.
as David did. For it makes a man thus to reason: God has made many faithful
promises never to fail or forsake them that trust in him. He has hitherto
made good his word to me. He still remains the same God, true and faithful.
I will therefore trouble my self with undue fears. I fear no evil; but
believe that it shall ever go well with me. Hereupon also faithful parents
exhort their children to trust in God: yea quietly they commend their own
souls into Gods hands, and commend their children to Gods providence, and that
upon this ground, exhorting them also to depend on God, as David did, 1 Chr 22.
11. and 28. 9.) For Habet fides o culo* suos quibus quodammodo videt verum esse
quod nondum videt. Aug. epist. 85.
faith has eyes whereby it does after a manner see that to be true, which yet
it sees not.

. 70. Of the use of Faith in adversity.
IN adversity it has also a double use.

1 It vpholdeth us in the present distress, when else we know not what do:
instance David (1 Samuel 30. 6.) and Iehosaphat (2 Chr. 20. 12.)

2 It moves us patiently to Ose. 6. 1, 2.
wait for deliverance: for God having promised to give a good issue, Faith
rests upon it, even as if it were now accomplished.

Thus in general we see how Faith has his use always in all estates.

. 71. Of often calling to mind Gods promises.
I Will furthermore particularly show how we come to shelter our souls under
Faith. Two helps of Faith.
For this, two especial things are requisite.

1 A faithful remembrance of Gods promises.

2 A wise and right application of them.

For the first, David h hid Gods promises in his heart: thus it came to pass
that those Remembrance of p^omises.
promises vpheld him in his trouble, Psalm. 119. 11. ^^50.
and he received admirable comfort by them. Assuredly if the believer do call
to mind Gods promise of succor and redress in his distress, it will quiet
him for the time, and make him rest in hope till he enjoy the accomplishment of
that promise. It is dangerous to forget Gods promises.
While a believer well remembers, and duly considers what great and
excellent promises are made, how mighty, faithful and merciful he is that made
them, he thinks that the world may be as soon overthrown, as his Faith.
But the letting of Gods promises slip out of his memory, is that which makes
him faint. The Apostle having Heb. 12. 3, 5.
secretly intimated unto the Hebrews their fainting, declares the cause
thereof, Sicut lucerna nisi ei subministraueris oleum extinguetur, sic fides
nisi assiduis nutriatur meditationibus scripturarum. Chrysostom. in Mat. 25.
by telling them they forgot the consolation: for that which is not remembered,
is as not known. Now Gods promises being the ground and very life of Faith,
what use of Faith can there be, if Gods promises be unknown, or (which for the
time is all one,) not remembered? As a lamp will soon be out, if oil be not
continually supplied: so Faith, if it be not nourished with continual
meditation of Gods promises, will soon fail.

Isa. 50. 4.
God has given the tongue of the learned: yea (among and above all others) of
them whom God has placed in his steed, to whom 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.
he has committed the word of reconciliation: let us use their help for the
finding out of Gods promises, and having knowledge of them, often meditate and
think on them, that so they may be the more firmly imprinted in our memories,
as in a good treasury and store house, and the more ready to be brought forth
for our use; like that Mat. 13. 52.
good householder which brings forth out of his treasure, things both new and
old. As we use our memories, so shall we find them ready to help us in time of
need: Number. 15. 38. Deuteronomy. 6, 7. etc.
God therefore prescribed unto his people diverse helps for their memories.

. 72. Of well applying Gods promises.
IN the second particular help (which is wise and right application of Gods
promises) consists the greatest use of Faith, 2 Right application.
for which we have need of the Spirit of wisdom and revelation.

The promises of the Word are declarations of Gods favor toward man, and of
his providence over him for his good: for it pleased God as to take care of
man, and to provide for him all things needful, so before^ hand to make
faithful promises to him thereof, to uphold him till the time of the
accomplishment of them.

Now for the better application of them, we are to consider both the promises
themselves, and the persons to whom they are made.

In the promises three things are to be observed. First, the matter contained
in them. Secondly, the kind or quality of them. Thirdly, the manner of
propounding them.

The matter of Gods promises, General promises.
is either general, concerning supply of all good things, and deliverance from
all evil: or particular, concerning the several particular estates, and needs
of men.

. 73. Of applying general promises.
THat first promise which God made to man after his fall ( Genesis 3. 15.
He shall break thine head,) was a general promise: for by it is promise made
of Christ Jesus, and of that full redemption which Christ should make of man.
So that promise which God made to Abram ( Genesis 22. 18.
In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:) Here is all
happiness in Christ promised to all the faithful. And that which the Apostle
sets down, Romans 8. 28.
All things shall work together for the good of them that love God, etc. And
again, 1 Cor. 3. 22.
All things are yours: that is, all things tend to your good, and help forward
your happiness and salvation. Many other like general promises there be in
the Scripture, Why general promises are to be observed.
which are the rather to be remembered, because they extend themselves to all
estates, to all conditions, and to all kind of distresses whatsoever; so that
if we cannot call to mind particular promises, fit for our present estate, we
may uphold our selves with these general promises. For example, Genesis 3. 15.
when the devil or any of that serpentine brood shall assault us, remember we
that all that they can do, is but to nibble at our heels, he shall never be
able to crush our head, to destroy our soul: yet his head shall be crushed, he
utterly vanquished. If we be in any misery, remember we that blessedness is
promised unto us, Genesis 22. 18.
and blessed shall we be. If any thing seem to make against us, Romans 8. 28.
this is promised to be the issue, that all shall turn to our good.

. 74. Of applying particular promises.
PArticular promises fit for our particular estates and needs are added to the
general, Why particular promises ^^^dfull.
because we are weak and subject to slip, and cannot well apply, and rest upon
the general promises. These are very many, I will endeavor to draw them to
some distinct heads.

They concern this life, or the life to come. Those for this life are of
temporal, or spiritual blessings. For the life to come, heavenly and glorious
things are promised.

Promises of tempo^all things are to supply things needful. remove things
hurtful.

For supply of things needful, it is said, Psalm. 34. 9.
Nothing shall be wanting. Mat. 6. 33.
All things shall be ministered. Phil. 4. 19.
God shall fulfill all your necessity, etc. Besides, there are other
particular promises fitted to our several necessities: to such as want meat,
drink or apparel, Christ has said, Mat. 6. 25. 32*
Be not careful for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
nor yet for your body what ye shall put on, etc. your heavenly Father knows
that ye have need of all these things. They which desire to have yet more
particulars, let them read Leu. 26. 4, 5. etc. and Deat 28. 3, 4. etc.

In the Scripture are further to be found particular promises for Orphans,
Widows, Captives, etc. likewise for time of war, famine, sickness, etc.

If now we want any needful thing, the use of Faith is to make us rest upon
these and such like promises: for if they be rightly believed, they will make
us cast our care on God that cares for us, and moderate our immeasurable
carking aftet them; moving us patiently to wait for the accomplishment of our
desire, or contentedly to want what God denies.

For removing things hurtful, and delivering us out of troubles, God has
expressly said, Psalm. 50. 15.
I will deliver thee. and 91. 10, 11, 12*
There shall none evil come unto thee: The Angels ha^^ charge over thee, to
keep thee in all thy ways, le^t thou dash the foot, etc.

Here then the use of Faith is this, that if we be in any trouble, these and
such like promises make us rest quiet* patiently expecting the issue that God
will give, and th^^ without prefixing any time (for Isa* 28. 16.
He that believes make^^ not haste,) or prescribing any means to him, (as
faithful Moses when he said, Exodus 14. 13.
Stand still, and see the faluation of the Lord, etc.)

For spiritual matters, we have many most comfortable promises, as that Ier.
31. 33. etc.
God will be our God, we shall be his people, we shall all know him: he will
forgive our iniquities: he will write his Law in our heart: Luke 11. 13*
he will give the Holy Ghost to them that desire him, etc. So there are many
particular promises for particular graces, as for Faith, Hope, Love, etc. And
for growth and increase in these.

The use of Faith here is to uphold us against our manifold defects,
infirmities, and imperfections. For first it gives evidence to our souls,
that the graces we have are the gifts of God, because God promises them.
Secondly, it makes us rest on God for perfecting of that good work which he
has so graciously begun; 2 Timothy 1. 11*
I know whom I have believed (says Saint Paul) and I am persuaded that he is
able to keep that which I have committed to him, etc.

For promises of heavenly things, the Scripture is every where plentiful:
that Luke 23. 43
the soul shall at the dissolution of the body go immediately to Heaven, that
1 Cor. 15. 22
the body shall rise again, and Phil. 3. 21.
be made like to the glorious body of Christ: and we Mat. 25. 34.
enjoy everlasting happiness, with the like.

The use of Faith in regard of these, is to uphold us with the expectation of
that heavenly happiness which is promised, yea, though we be here destitute
of worldly things, and in many troubles and tribulations.

. 75. Of applying absolute promises.
2 FOr the kinds of Gods promises, The kinds of Gods promises* 1. Absolute
promises.
some are absolute which God has simply and absolutely determined to
accomplish even as they are propounded: as before Christ was manifested in the
flesh, Isa. 7* 14.
the promise of the Messiah, and and 2. 1*
of calling the Gentiles: since that time the Romans 11* 26
promise of calling the Jews, and of Mat. 24. 30
Christ's second coming in glory. 1 Cor. 1. 5.
All saving, sanctifying graces, being absolutely necessary to salvation, are
thus promised to all Gods children: and 8.
the continuance and perseverance of them unto the end; and also the end and
issue of all, John 10. 28.
eternal life.

The use of Faith in these, is to uphold us against all fear and doubt, even
when we have not a sensible feeling of them: for God (who is able to perform
whatsoever he has promised; and true and faithful in all his promises) having
absolutely promised such and such things, though all things in Heaven and Earth
should seem to make against them, yet would Faith believe them.

. 76. Of applying conditional promises.
OTher promises are conditional, 2 Conditional promises.
which are no further promised then God in wisdom sees to be most meet for
his own glory, and his childrens good. Thus are promised,

1 All temporal blessings, Luke 16. 20.
which Lazarus an holy Saint wanted.

2 Freedom from all crosses and troubles. What Saint has not had his part in
some of them? who has been freed from all?

3 Freedom from all temptations. As our head was tempted, so have his members
from time to time.

4 Less principal graces, which are called restraining graces, being given
rather for the good of others, then of them who have them. 1 Cor. 12. 8, etc.
These the Spirit distributeth severally, not all to every one, but some to
one, some to another.

5 The measure of sanctifying graces: for though every Saint has every saving
grace in him, yet has he not a like measure: some have a greater, and some a
less.

Admirable is the use of Faith in these conditional promises: The use of Faith
in conditional promises.
for it makes us so to trust to Gods power, as we subject our selves unto his
will; as Mar. 1. 40.
the Leaper, who said; If thou will thou can make me clean; and Dan. 3. 17,
18
those three constant servants of God, who said; Our God is able to deliver us
from the hot fiery Furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King.
But if not, be it known to thee O King, that we will not serve thy gods, etc.
For Faith persuades us that God is wiser then our selves, and that he better
knows what is good for us then we our selves do, and so moves us to resign
up our selves wholly to Gods good pleasure.

This is the general use of Faith in respect of these conditional promises,
it has also other particular uses, as

1 For temporal things, so to rest on Gods promise, as we believe God will
either supply our wants, or enable us to bear them: as God had taught Paul
Phil. 4. 1^.
how to want.

2 For crosses, so to bear them, as being assured that God will either free us
from them, as he delivered Ioh. 42. 10.
Job: or 1 Cor. 10. ^3
assist us and enable us to bear them, Heb. 12. 1^
and turn them to our good.

3 1 Cor. 10. 1^
For temptations that God will stand by us, and give a good issue.

4 For restraining and common graces so to content our selves, as we doubt not
but also to have such sanctifying as shall be needful to our salvation; which
also is to be applied to the measure of sanctifying graces, according to that
answer of God to Saint Paul, 2 Cor. 12. 9.
My grace is sufficient for thee.

. 77. Of applying implicit promises.
FOr the manner of propounding Gods promises, The diverse manner of setting
down Gods promises.
they are either expressly declared, or else by consequence implied. Express
promises are either generally propounded to all: of these we have heard before;
or else particularly applied to some particular persons. Some of these are such
as are not proper to him alone to whom in particular they are directed; but for
the good of others also. If we find such needful for us, it is the use of
Faith to apply them to our selves with as strong confidence as if they had
been directed to us. This Heb. 13. 5.
the Apostle teaches us to do: for where God made a promise to Ioshuah, (
Ios. 1. 9.
I will not fail thee, etc.) the Apostle applies it to all Christians. The
ground of this application is taken from Gods unchangeable and impartial
manner of dealing: the same God that he is to one faithful man, the same he is
to all. If therefore he would not fail I^shuah, neither will he fail any.

By consequence promises are implied, either in the examples, or prayers of
faithful Saints.

In their examples, by those blessings which they have enjoyed. For that which
God bestows on one, he is ready to bestow on every one to whom it is
needful: Gods giving it to one, is a promising of it to all. So as we may with
as strong confidence depend upon God for such needful things, as if God had
expressly promised them. Thus does Iam. 5. 11.
Saint James urge that end which God gave to Jobs troubles, as a ground of our
Faith, to make us wait for a like deliverance in our troubles.

In their prayers, by those things which they have prayed for in Faith and
obtained. Their faithful calling upon God, and Gods gracious hearing of them,
are as much as a promise, that God in such and such things will hear us
calling upon him: thus did David make this a ground of his faith. Psalm. 22. 5.

The use of Faith in these implicit promises is to persuade our hearts that God
will deal with us as he has in former times dealt with his faithful
children.

. 78. Of the true Heirs of Gods promises.
THe last point to be noted for the right application of Gods promises, is the
persons to whom they belong. Here note two points.

1 Who are the righteous heirs and children of Gods promises. The persons to
who^ Gods promises belong.


2 How these heirs are qualified.

1 For the first, Christ Jesus the true natural Son of God, as he was
Emanuel, God with us, our Head and our Redeemer, is properly the heir of all
Gods promises, 2 Cor. 1. 20.
In him they are, yea, and Amen. That is to say; In him they are propounded,
ratified, and accomplished. This is evident by those general promises which
are the foundation of all the rest. Genesis 3. 15.
He, (that is, Christ) shall break thine head. and 22. 18.
In thy seed ( Gal. 3. 16.
that is, Christ) shall all the Nations of the Earth ^e blessed. Now how is
Christ the heir of Gods promises? as a private person? only in himself? No
verily: but as a public person, as the head of a body: for Jesus together with
all the Saints, which were given him of his Father, make but one mystical
body, 1 Cor. 12. 12
which is Christ: so as all the faithful together with Christ are heirs of
the promises; they, and they alone have a right unto them: so as what the
Apostle says of godliness. I may fitly apply to Faith, which is the Mother of
all Godliness, 1 Timothy 4. 8.
Faith is profitable unto all things, which has the promise of the life
present, and of that which is to come. Both general and particular promises,
promises of earthly, spiritual, and heavenly things; conditional, and
absolute promises: all promises belong to the faithful.

. 79. Of applying Gods promises to the right persons.
2 FOr the second, the several conditions and qualities of the persons to whom
several promises are made, are exceeding many. Sometimes they are made to
Faith, sometimes to obedience, sometimes to uprightness, to cheerfulness, to
constancy, to love, to fear; to such as mourn, hunger, are heavy laden; to
such as pray, hear Gods Word, keep his Commandments; to the fatherless,
widows, captives, poor, sick, etc. It is not possible, neither yet is it
needful that I should reckon up all: they are here and there to be found
throughout the Scripture.

The uses of Faith in respect of the persons to whom the promises are made, are
these.

1 To assure us that we are they to whom they appertain.

2 To make us apply them to those several qualities which we find in our
selves, as if we hunger, to believe we shall be satisfied; if we mourn, that
we shall be comforted, and so in the rest.

To make us expect the accomplishment of them, according to our several needs:
as when we are in any trouble, to expect deliverance; when tempted, assistance;
when in want, relief, etc.

Thus (as distinctly as I can) have I showed how the shield of Faith may be
used.

Hitherto of the manner of the Apostles exhortation.

. 80. Of the meaning of the Metaphor.
THe motive whereby he inforceth his exhortation, 8. Point. The benefit and
power of Faith.
follows: wherein is contained the eight general point to be delivered in
this Treatise of Faith, which is the benefit and power of Faith, in these words;

Wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Devil.

THe Apostle here uses another Metaphor. His manner of phrase may at first
sight seem to be improper, That a man should take a shield to quench fire: A
shield is rather to keep off a blow. But if we well note the drift of the
Apostle, and also the manner of framing his speech, we may find that it is not
so improper as it is taken to be. For first, he says not, By the shield ye
quench; but (...).
by it ye shall be able to quench. Again, he says not simply, whereby ye
shall be able to quench darts, that had been improper, but he adds fiery.
Thus because Satan's temptations are as darts, and as fiery darts, he uses the
metaphor of a shield, in opposition to the one, and the metaphor of quenching
in opposition to the other. Thus we see that the Apostles speech is proper
enough, answearing two metaphors in their several kinds: A shield in relation
to d^rts: quenching in relation to fiery.

Besides, A double benefit of Faith.
hereby he declares a double benefit of Faith: one to protect us from Satan's
temptations, that they annoy us not: the other, (if they do pierce and wound
our souls,) to cure the hurt which they have done.

To amplify this benefit of Faith, the Apostle describes our enemy by his
malicious and mischievous nature ( the wicked) (or, (...).
as the original with an emphasis sets it down, that wicked one) and his
temptations, by the kind of them under this metaphor Darts.

Of the nature of this wicked one, I have spoken before on verse 12.

For the metaphor, a Dart is a kind of weapon that is flung, slung, or shot at
a man far off, which if it hit him, will deeply pierce him, and sorely gall
him. I showed before how we were often forced to wrestle with Satan, and to
grapple with him hand to hand. Here is showed that he has also Darts to shoot
at us a* far off, so as he can pierce and wound us when we see him not: he
can send at us, though he come not to us. As when Reu. 12. 15.
the Dragon could not come at the Woman, he cast waters after her. This Woman
is the Church; the red Dragon, Satan; Waters, his manifold temptations or darts.

Thus we see that

The Devil can every way annoy us, Obser. Satan can every way annoy us.
both at hand and afar off: when he is suffered to come to us, and when he is
restrained and kept from us.



That the benefit and power of Faith may be the better discerned, I will show
more distinctly, 1 What these Darts are. 2 How they are kept off. 3 Why they
are called f^^^y. 4 How they are quenched.


. 81. Of Satan's Darts here meant.
SOme take afflictions to be meant by Darts. What are Satan's darts.


Answer. There is another proper piece of armo^ to defend us from the hurt of
them, namely, The preparation of the Gospel of Peace.

Other take all sins and all prouocations to sin, to be here meant.

Answ. This must needs be too general: for thus should the several pieces of
Armor, and their distinct uses be confounded. The Breast Plate of
Righteousness is the proper fence against such temptations.

I take the Darts here spoken of to be those several and sundry temptations
which the Devil uses to draw us to doubt of that help we have in GOD,
Diabolus in varias desper ationis cogitationes nos immittit, quo excludat in
Deum expectationem. Chrysostom. paren. ad Theod.
and to despair: for often he casts sundry thoughts of despair into us, that
he might shut out all hope in God, and so draw into perdition. Thus
afflictions, so far forth as the Devil uses them as means to disquiet and
vex the soul, may be here understood: and likewise all sins and
prouocations to sin, as they tend hereunto. These temptations were they light
and fasten, pierce deep. Satan let store of these fly against Job, they fell
on him as thick as haile-stones: despair was it which Satan sought to bring
Job unto by depriving him of his cattle, goods, children, and all that he had:
by striking his body all over with sore botches and boiles. The contradicting
speeches of Jobs wife and friends (the instruments of Satan herein) tended to
this. These darts also he let fly at David, as appears by the many
complaints of David: yea, he flung some of these at Christ in the Mat 4. 3.
wilderness, in the and 26. 37, etc
garden, and on the and 27. 46.
cross. No darts so wound the body, as these wound the soul where they fasten.

. 82. Of the virtue of Faith against Satan's Darts.
2 THese darts are only kept off by Faith: Faith only keeps off the darts
of Satan.
for Faith alone gives us assurance of Gods love: by it we so rest and repose
our selves on the favor of God in Christ, as nothing can make us doubt of it,
or separate us from it. Job 13. 15.
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him, says Job. Read Psalm. 3. and 91.
and Romans 8. 38, 39. The stronger our Faith is, the better are we fenced against
these temptations: the weaker our Faith is, the deeper do they pierce: yea if
they prevail against us, it is because we want this shield, or at least have
let it fall, and so for the time want the use of it. Therefore 1 P^t. 5. 9.
Saint Peter exhorts to be steadfast in the Faith, while we resist the
devil; as if he had said, Look to your shield, keep it safe, hold it out
manfully against all the darts of the devil.

. 83. Of Satan's fiery darts.
3 THey who by these Darts understand afflictions, What are Satan's fiery darts.
say, they are called fiery, because afflictions are grievous to the flesh;
they who understand sins, because as fire they kindle one another and so
increase.

Answ. But there is an higher matter here meant; for the metaphor is taken from
malicious mischievous enemies who poison the heads of darts, and arrows, and
bullets which they shoot at men: these poisoned things being of a fiery nature,
if they pierce into a man's flesh, lie burning, and tormenting the body, and
continue to inflame it more and more, till they have soaked out the very life
of a man, if in time they be not cured. Thus the forenamed temptations of
Satan, tending to doubt and despair, (if they fasten) vex, grieve and torment
the soul, burning and festring therein, till they bring a man to utter
destruction, if the fire and heat of them be not slaked and taken away. It
must needs be great burning, great anguish and vexation that made David cry
out and say, Psalm. 6. 1, 3, 6
O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath, etc. My bones are vexed: my soul is also
sore vexed, etc. I fainted in my mourning, etc* and 31. 9, 10. and 32. 3, 4.
I am in trouble, mine eye, my soul and my belly are consumed with grief,
etc. I roared all the day. Job 3. 3. etc. and 6. 2, etc.
Much more bitter exclamations did Job send forth, and yet what men were these?
what excellent Worthies of the Lord? If the fiery venom, and burning poison of
Satan's darts so tormented such men, men of admirable Faith, how do they
torment men of weak Faith, yea men of no Faith? Mat. 27. 5.
Judas was so tormented thereby, that his life was an unsupportable burden unto
him, he could not endure it, but made away himself, as many other have done in
all ages.

. 84. Of the virtue of Faith against Satan's fiery Darts.
4 THe only means to cool this scorching hear, By Faith only the fiery
darts of Satan are quenched.
and to assuage this burning, is the blood of Christ: and Faith only is the
means to apply the efficacy of Christ's blood to our souls: by Faith
therefore, and by nothing else, may these fiery Darts be quenched. As balsom,
and such other medicinable oils which Chirurgio^s have for that purpose, being
applied to that part of man's body which is in flamed with the forenamed
poisonous weapons, assuage the heat, drive out the poison, and cure the flesh:
so Faith, which applies the virtue of Christ's Sacrifice to a perplexed and
troubled soul, dispelleth the inward anguish thereof, pacifieth and quieteth
it, and so cures the wounds thereof. The Faith of David did thus cheer up and
refresh his soul after it had been perplexed; in which respect he says unto
his soul, Psalm. 42. 5.
Why art thou cast down and unquiet? Wait^ on God, etc. Thus 11. and
again, 43. 5.
and again he cheereth up his soul: this also drew the fiery poison out of
Jobs soul, as that speech implies, Job 13. 15.
Though he s^lay me, yet will I trust in him.

. 85. Of stirring against despair.
ARe temptations to despair, Use. 1. Yield not to despair.
piercing Darts? fiery Darts? Keep them off as much as possibly may be. As we
fear to drink poison, let us fear to despair. It will be a fiery burning
poison in our soul, that will yield us no rest; as we see in such as are
overcome thereby. Let us not dare to yield unto it; but though God should seem
to be so angry with us as to kill us, yet with Job, to trust in him. For this
end we must suffer Faith to have the upper place in us, even above sense and
reason too. And for this end look unto God, Qui diffidit, summi b^ni bonitatem
maiorem sua nequitia non sentit. Aug. de ver. poen, cap. 5.
and duly weigh both what he promises, and why he makes such gracious
promises to us: and look not to our selves and our own deseruings, but rather
know that Gods mercy is as an ocean in comparison of the drops of our sins:
they that despair, little consider how much greater Gods goodness is, then
their sin.

. 85. Of the need and benefit of Faith.
IN how wretched a condition do they live, Use 2. Wretched are they who want
Faith.
who are destitute of Faith! they lie open to all the fiery, burning,
tormenting temptations of the devil; they have no means to prevent them, none
to quench them when they are wounded in conscience. This fire must needs either
stupifie all their spiritual senses, dry up all the life of the soul, and
take away all feeling: or else torment them intollerably without all hope of
redress, as Caine, Saul, Judas, and such like were tormented. It were much
better for a man not to be, then not to believe.

What an admirable virtue is Faith? Use 3. The virtue of Faith.
what virtue has it in it self? What benefit does it bring unto us? What
Christian soldier (that is wise, and fears these fiery darts,) dares enter
into the battle without this balsom? The maine and principal end, for which
the Apostle here sets down these benefits of Faith, that which especially
he aymeth at, is, to commend unto us this precious gift, so as it may be a
strong motive to urge all the forenamed points concerning Faith, whereof we
have spoken before, and to stir us up diligently to labor and use all the
means we can, First to know what true Faith is, Secondly, to get it, Thirdly,
to prove it, Fourthly, to preserve and increase it, Fifthly, well and wisely to
use it.

. 86. Of spiritual recovery.
BEhold here a sure ground of much comfort and great encouragement, Use. 4.
Spiritual wounds may be cured.
even to such as are weak, and by reason of their weakness, or else through
the violence of some temptation, have let fall their shield, so as Satan's fiery
Darts have touched their conscience, and pierced their soul. Let them not
thereupon utterly despair, and yield themselves over to Satan's power, but know
that yet their Faith may stand them in steed, that yet there is a further use
of it, not only as a shield to keep off, but as balsome to draw out the
fire, to quench it, and cure the wound. (...).
The word which the Apostle here uses, implies (as we have showed) a
recovering, resuming, and taking up again our shield. Let not therefore our
faintings, failings, and spiritual wounds put us out of all hope, as if death
and destruction, without all remedy and recovery, must needs follow thereupon:
But rather let us with all speed have recourse to Gods promises, and to Christ
Jesus the true heir of them, and so renew our Faith, as Luke 22. 61.
Peter renewed his, when he looked upon Christ.

. 87. Of Satan's assaulting our Faith.
THe last point yet remains, IX. Point. Satan's wyles against Faith.
which is, to discover the manifold wiles which the Devil uses against this
heavenly gift, and to show how they may be avoided. We have heard before how
he labors to spoil us of the Girdle of Truth, Satan most of all assaulteth
our faith.
Brestplate of Righteousness, and Shoes of Patience; but his best wit and
greatest force is bent against the Shield of Faith. The first assault made
against Eve, was in regard of her Faith, Genesis 3. 1.
Has God indeed said, etc: so against Christ, ( Mat. 4* 3.
If thou be the Son of God, etc.) Herein did he often tempt the Psalm. 78. 22.
31.
Israelites, yea and Moses Number. 20. 12
also in the wilderness. Luke 22. 32.
This was it for which he desired to winnow Peter; and for which These. 3. 5.
Paul feared lest he had tempted the Thessalonians. Lamentable experience
shows how mightily he prevails by this temptation: in time of persecution
he brings men hereby to renounce their profession: and hereby at all times he
brings many to the very pit of despair.

That which has been before delivered concerning the excellency, Reason.
necessity, use and benefit of Faith, declares the reason, why the Devil so
assaulteth it: for he, being our Adversary walking about, and seeking whom to
devour, espieth that Faith is it which especially preserves us safe from
being devoured; that this is the victory which overcomes both 1 Pet. 5. 9.
himself and his chief agent and instrument the 1 Ioh. 5. 4.
world; and therefore with all might and maine endeavors to spoil us of
this shield. It is therefore needful we should know what are his wyles, and
how they may be avoided.

His sundry kinds of wyles may be drawn to two heads, namely those whereby he
labors either to keep men from Faith, or else to wrest Faith from them. I
will in order discover some of the principal in both kinds, which are these.

. 88. Answer to Satan's Suggestion, that it is presumption to believe.
1. Suggest. FIrst, it is altogether impossible to attain unto any such gift
as Faith is. Secondly, can any man be assured that Christ is his? Thirdly,
whosoever has any such conceit, presumes. Fourthly, to enforce this
temptation the further, he also suggesteth, that the ground of Faith (Gods
word) is uncertain. And fifthly, though that Scripture were the certain Word of
God, yet the Ministry of it by man, is too weak a means to work so great a
work as Faith is thought to be this Suggestion has prevailed much with
Papists.

Answ. First, that which has been before delivered concerning the getting of
Faith, shows that this is a lying Suggestion. Secondly, it has been expressly
proved that a man may know he has Faith. Thirdly, the differences betwixt
Faith and presumption show, that assurance of Faith is no presumption.

1 Faith drives a man out of himself: Differences betwixt faith and
presumption.
because the believer can find no ground of confidence in himself, therefore
he casts himself wholly upon CHRIST.

Presumption finds something in the man himself to make him boast.

2 Faith rests on a sure ground, which is Gods Word, that both commands us
to believe, and promises to perform that which we do believe.

Presumption relyeth only on a man's surmize and mere conjecture.

3 Faith is joined with the use of the means: both of those means whereby it
was first bred, and also of those which God has appointed for the nourishing
of it.

Presumption not only carelessly neglects, but arrogantly contemns all
means.

4 Faith is wrought by degrees: first by knowledge, then by grief, after by
desire, as we heard. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24* and. 41, 42, 43, 44, 44.
before.

Presumption is a sudden apprehension of the mind.

5 Faith makes a man work out his salvation with an holy jealousy, yea with
fear and trembling: often calling upon God, and depending on him.

Presumption is ouer-bold.

6 Faith makes a man depart from all iniquity, and keep a clear conscience.

Presumption is accompanied with much pollution, at least inward.

7 Faith is most sure in time of trial, then is the strength of it most
manifested.

Presumption like a Bragadocha then makes greatest flourish when there is least
danger.

8 Faith continues unto the end, and never falls away.

Presumption is subject to decay totally and finally.

4 Of the certainty of Gods word we shall after speak:

5 For man's Ministry it is Gods ordinance; and thence it has that mighty
power to work Faith: for God who at first brought light out of darkness, can
by weak means work great matters: Besides, 2 Cor. 4. 7
We have this treasure in earthly vessels, that the excellency of that power
might be of God, and not of us.

. 89. Answer to Satan's suggestion of the difficulty of getting Faith.
2 Suggest. IF it be not impossible to get Faith, yet it is so difficult and
hard a matter, that not one of a thousand who seek it, obtain it. Herein
Satan prevails with idle, slothful persons, Pro. 22. 13 and 26. 13.
who in all things which they should enterprise, pretend more dangers and
difficulties then needs, of purpose to find a pretense to their idleness.

Answer. Though it be hard to the carnal careless man, Faith not hard to the
willing.
yet (as Solomon says of knowledge, Pro. 14. 6.) Faith is easy to him that
will believe; not that it is simply in man's power, but that Gods Spirit so
opens his understanding in the mysteries of godliness, so works on his
hard and stony heart, making the one capable, and the other pliable, as thereby
the man is brought like softened wax easily to receive the impression of Gods
seal. Though man in himself be dead in sin, yet Gods word is as powerful to
quicken him, as Christ's was to raise Lazarus. Indeed many seek, and find not,
ask, and have not: but why? Iam. 4. 3
Saint James gives one reason, They ask, and seek amiss. They seek Faith
in themselves, and from themselves: they seek it by carnal and fleshly
devices: they seek it by their own wit and reason. Saint Paul renders
another reason, 2 Cor. 4. 4.
The God of this world has blinded their minds, that the glorious light of the
Gospel should not shine unto them. Because they oppose against Gods truth so
far as it is made known unto them, or wittingly wink at it, or turn from
it, God gives them over in just judgment to the power of Satan, who blinds
their minds. But if we repair to the Author who gives Faith, and to the
spring whence it flows; if we rightly use the right means of attaining it,
and wait at the door of Wisdom till she open unto us, undoubtedly we shall
find Faith and not miss of it.

. 90. Answer to Satan's suggestion of the small need and use of Faith.
3 Suggest. FAith is a needless thing. This conceit the Devil puts into
the mind of two sorts of people: first of proud Pharisaicall Iusticiaries, who
trust to their own righteousness: these think that the breast plate of
righteousness is armor enough: Secondly, of secure, carnal Gospellers, who
imagine that a good hope (as they call it) is sufficient, there needs not
assurance of Faith.

Answer. God makes and ordains nothing in vain: as for the proud
Iusticiary, Great need of Faith.
let him first know, that righteousness severed from Faith, is no
righteousness: though righteousness joined with Faith be of good use, yet
severed from Faith, it is of no use at all. Secondly, that the Breast Plate of
righteousness, which the best men ever in this World had, was full of crackes
and holes, full of many defects and imperfections, through which Satan would
soon have wounded them even to death, if they had not had this shield.

As for the secure Protestant, if ever he feel the fire of Satan's darts, he
will find that all the assurance which possibly he can attain unto, is little
enough. That poor man which said; Mar. 9. 24.
I believe, Lord help my unbelief: And the Disciples which said, Luke 17. 5.
Lord increase our faith, saw that a good hope was not enough.

As a preservative against this poisonous temptation, we must labor for all
the assurance of Faith that we can.

. 90. Answer to Satan's suggestion of the damage arising from Faith.
4 Suggest. FAith is hurtful to a man's credit, honor, profit, pleasure, etc.
Herein Satan prevails with worldlings, whose hearts are only on things here
below.

Answer. First, the price of Faith, Great is the worth of Faith.
yea of one grain of Faith, is of more worth then all the treasure in the
world: this that good Mat. 13. 44.
Merchant well knew, who sold all to buy it.

Secondly, they who are wounded with Satan's fiery darts, would willingly forgo
all credit, wealth, and pleasure that the World possibly can give, for a dram
of Faith.

Thirdly there can be no true credit, honor, etc. without Faith: all are
sanctified by Faith, otherwise they are mere shadows and shows.

. 91. Answer to Satan's suggestion of Man's unworthiness.
5 Suggest. FAith is too good and precious a thing for poor wretched sinners
to have: herein he prevails with distressed fearful Christians.

Answer. Man's unworthiness no hinderance of Faith.
For removing of this, we must remember what was. 28. 29.
before delivered of Gods free grace, and rich bounty, which is not restrained
by our un worthiness.

If the Devil by these, or such like means cannot keep us from getting
faith, he has other wiles to wrest it from us, which follow.

. 92. Answer to Satan's suggestion of man's imperfection.
6 Suggest. THy Faith is not sound, but counterfeit: for it is mixed with many
imperfections, transgressions, weaknesses, doubtings; there is no growth or
increase of it: many weak Christians are brought hereby to stagger.

Answer. Imperfect Faith may be true and sound.
Often prove thy Faith, especially by the causes, and by thy love, and Heb. 13.
18.
true desire to live honestly: Know that every thing here is imperfect, yet
that truth and imperfection may stand together: strive against these
imperfections, and use the means for increase of Faith.

. 93. Answer to Satan's suggestion of trusting to means.
7 Suggest. THere are meet helps afforded for all distresses: why may not men
trust to them? Is it not good to seek to the Physician in sickness? to trust
unto number and prowess of men in war? and to friends in time of need? Thus
he makes many to cast away the shield of Faith, their confidence in God, and
to trust unto outward means, as 2 Ch^. 16 12
Asa.

Answer. All means are subordinate to Gods Providence, and guided thereby:
Subordinate means take not away the use of Faith.
therefore in the use of them we must look unto God, and depend on him, and
call upon him for a blessing: neither supply of meet means, nor want of them,
must any whit lessen our trust in God, but to God must all the glory be given,
whatsoever the means be.

. 94. Answer to Satan's suggestion of apostasy.
8 Suggest. THou can never hold out: thy Faith will not only be in vain,
but thy latter end is like to be worse then the beginning: How many have fallen
away in all ages, and daily do fall away?

Answer. Faith falls not clean away.
There are means to preserve and increase Faith, as well as to get it: let
them be well used, and thy Faith shall never fail: Luke 22. 32.
Remember Christ's prayer for Peter's Faith: as for others, we cannot so well
know the ^oundnesse of their Faith as of our own.

. 95. Direction against Satan's storms.
IF he prevail not by any of these, or such like subtle suggestions, he will
try by all the storms and troubles he can, to shake and overthrow our Faith.

We must therefore be like sound Oaken Trees, which the more they are shaken,
the deeper root they get in the earth; and know for our comfort, the Devil can
raise no greater storms then God in wisdom permits him. Virtus fidei
inper^cutis secura est. Chrysostom. in Mat. 20. hom. 37.
God in the end will turn all to our good, as he dealt with Job, ( Job 42. 10.
etc.) so that if we believe, we shall surely be established. Faith makes men
secure in perils.

THE SEVENTH PART.
The Helmet of Hope.
Ephesians 6. 17. And take the Helmet of Salvation.
. 1. Of the difficulty of a Christian Soldiers Estate.
EXcellent means of defense are those whereof we have heard, especially the
last of them: yet the Apostle thinks them not sufficient, but proceeds to
set forth other pieces of armor, saying, (...) Obseru. from the inference. No
easy matter to be a Christian Soldier.
And take, etc. Whence we may well gather, that

It is no easy matter to be a Christian Soldier, and steadfastly to stand unto
the end against all assaults. Many graces are needful to be added one to
another for that purpose. One might have though that when he had named the
shield of Faith, he need have added no more: but God who knows both our
weakness and pronenesse to faint, and also the power and subtilty of our
adversaries better then our selves, sees it needful that an helmet be used as
well as a shield: our care therefore must be to use this also.

. 2. Of the Spiritual Grace here meant.
THis fifth peace of Spiritual Armor (though it be not plainly expressed)
Some refer these two metaphors, Helmet, Sword, unto the Word of God, and say
that two uses of the word are set down under two metaphors: one to be
defensive as an Helmet: the other to be offensive as a sword.
is necessarily implied to be Hope; Hope the fifth pe^ce of armor.
for 1 These. 5. 3.
in another place where he uses this metaphor, Answer. The sword alone of it
self implies both these uses, for it is an especial means of defense as
well as of offense: these two metaphors being as distinctly set down as any of
the former, there is no reason why they should be referred to one and the same
thing.
he expresses Hope, Put on (says he) for an Helmet the hope of Salvation.
What could more plainly be spoken? and what better interpreter of the Apostles
mind could we have then the Apostle himself? Other say that Christ himself
is here meant by this metaphor Helmet, because he is Salvation, and because the
very word here used ((...)) is in other places attributed to Christ, as Luke 2.
30. and 3. 6.


Salvation is thus applied to Hope, because

1 Salvation is the maine end of our Hope, Why it is called the hope of
salvation.
that which above all toher things we wait for: Answer. It is not properly
attributed to Christ, but tropically, because he is the Author and finisher of
our salvation. It is more proper to take it for the thing it self which Christ
has purchased, eternal life.
when we come to the possession of it, then has Hope her end, and period.

2 It is an especial means of attaining unto Salvation, 2 Though Christ be
here meant by this word Salvation, yet cannot Christ with any fit congruity be
comprised under this metaphor Helmet: for if we read the words plainly, Take
the Helmet of Christ, what else can be meant but the helmet which Christ used,
or which he gives or prescribes to us, as the Armor of God? Thus it will be
the same thing which we mean, namely, Hope: for as Christ is the author and
finisher of our Faith, so also of our Hope.
( Romans 8. 24.
We are saved by Hope.) This is that coard whereby we hold fast to Gods
promises till they be all accomplished, which will not be until we enjoy
salvation.

3 Herein lies a maine difference betwixt the hope of worldlings, and Saints:
their hope reaches no further then to the things of this life; therefore Pro.
11. 7.
when they die their hope perishes, but these 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4.
hope for an inheritance immortal, etc. Therefore Pro. 14. 32.
they have hope in their death: for 1 Cor. 15. 19
if in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most
miserable.

Thus having showed what this Helmet of Salvation is, I will distinctly show,
1. What Hope is. 2 How it differs from Faith. 3 How fitly it is compared to
an Helmet. 4 How necessary it is. 5 How it is gotten, preserved, and used. 6
What are Satan's wiles against it.

. 3. Of the definition of Hope.
HOpe is an expectation of such good things to come, 1. Point. What hope is.
as God has promised, and Faith believed.

1 In expectation especially consists the very nature of Hope; Romans 8. 25.
(...).
If we hope, etc. Psalm. 37. 7.
We wait. David joins hoping and waiting together, as implying one and the
same thing; Psalm. 37. 7.
Wait upon the Lord, and hope in him.

2 Good things are the proper object of Hope: Spes non nisi bonarum rerum est,
nec nisi faturarum. Aug. Enchir. cap. 8.
herein it differs from Fear: We fear things evil and hurtful. I looked,
that is, hoped for good (says Job:) The thing (namely) that evil thing which
I feared, is come upon me? Job 3. 25 and 30. 26.)

3 These good things are to come: not past, nor present, which either are or
have been seen: Romans 8. 24.
Hope which is seen, is no hope: for how can a man hope for that which he
sees?

4 They are also such as God has promised. For the ground of our Hope is the
promise of God, who is faithful and true: we may well wait for that which he
has promised, whatsoever it be. In this respect this true Hope is termed Col.
1. 23.
The Hope of the Gospel: that is, an Hope which waits for those things which
in the Gospel are promised. Luke 3. 26.
This was the ground of Simeons Hope. These promises are of all needful things
in this world, both Spiritual and Temporal; of assistance under all crosses,
and of deliverance from them: and at length of eternal glory and happiness in
heaven, which (because it is furthest off, and includes in it an
accomplishment of all other promises,) is the most proper object of Hope. In
which respect the Scripture does thus entitle it, 1 These. 5. 8.
Hope of Salvation, Tit. 3. 7.
Hope of eternal life, Romans 5. 2.
Hope of glory, etc.

5 The things we hope for, are also such as Faith believed. For there is such a
relation betwixt Faith and Hope, as is betwixt a mother and a daughter: Faith
is the mother that brings forth Hope; and Hope is a blessed daughter which
nourishes Faith. Heb. 11. 1.
Faith is the ground of things hoped for. Till a thing be believed, a man will
never hope for it: Gal. 5. 5.
By Faith we wait: that is, Faith causes us to wait. Again, except a man
hope, and wait for that which he believes, his Faith will soon decay.

. 4. Of assurance and patience of Hope.
THus in general we see what Hope is. Two properties of Hope.
There are two especial properties which the Scripture does often annexe to
Hope, 1 Assurance. 2 Patience.


For Assurance, expressly says the Apostle, 1 Assurance.
Heb. 6. 11.
Show diligence to the full Assurance of Hope. In regard of this property it is
said, Romans 5. 5.
Hope makes not ashamed, that is, disappointeth not him that hops, of the
thing which he waits for, so as he need not be ashamed of his Hope. Fitly
therefore is it termed, Heb. 6. 19.
An Anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast. According to the quality and
quantity of Faith, is the quality and quantity of Hope. What a man believes,
that he hops for: as he believes, so he hops for it: but true Faith does
assuredly believe the truth of Gods promises: therefore true Hope does
certainly expect them, for there are the same props to uphold our Hope, as are
for our Faith, to wit, the goodness, power, truth, and other like attributes
of God: Hope arises not from man's promises, nor is nourished by man's merits.

Our adversaries make uncertainty a property of Hope, Uncertainty no property
of Hope.
and ground it upon conjectures and probabilities: whereby they take away one
main difference betwixt the hope of sound Christians, and carnal Libertines:
and clean overthrow the nature of saving Hope: for though, by reason of the
flesh, the best may sometimes waver in their Hope, as well as in their Faith:
yet is not this wavering of the nature of Hope, but the more Hope increases,
the more is doubting dispelled.

For Patience, 1 These. 1. 3. ^ Romans 8. 25.
that also is expressly attributed to Hope: If we hope for that we see not, we
do with patience wait for it: How needful it is that our Hope be
accompanied with patience, we shall see hereafter.

. 5. Of the agreement betwixt Faith and Hope.
HOpe agrees with Faith in many things: II. Point. Wherein Hope and Faith agree.
for example in these.

1 In the Author.
In the Author and worker of them both, which is Gods holy Spirit, as Gal. 5. 22.
Faith is a fruit of the Spirit, so Romans 15. 13.
we abound in Hope through the power of the holy Ghost.

2 In the matter.
In the common matter, for both are saving and sanctifying graces, as Ephesians. 2. 8.
We are saved by Faith, Romans 8. 25.
so also by Hope: and as Act. 15. 9.
By Faith the heart is purified, so 1 Ioh. 3. 3.
he that has Hope purges himself.

3 In the ground.
In the Ground of them, both of them are grounded on Gods promises as we have
heard.

4 In the properties.
In the forenamed properties Assurance and Patience. The same Apostle that made
mention of Heb. 6. 11.
Assurance of Hope, mentions also and 10. 21.
Assurance of Faith, and as Romans 8. 25.
he that hops waits with patience, so Isa. 28. 16.
he which believes makes not haste.

5 In the continuance.
In continuance, which is only til they have brought us to the possession of
the inheritance promised: in which respect Love, which continues even in
Heaven, is preferred both to Faith and Hope.

6 In the effects.
In many excellent effects: as are a clear and quiet conscience: an utter
denial of a man's self: a casting of himself wholly on Gods grace: a patient
bearing of all crosses, perseverance unto the end, etc.

. 6. Of the difference betwixt Faith and Hope.
THey differ in these things especially. Wherein they differ.


1 In their order: Faith is first, for it brings forth Hope: Heb. 11. 1.
Faith is the ground of things hoped for.

2 In the kind of Object: Faith is also of things Heb. 11. 3.
past, and Ioh. 20. 29.
present: hope only of things to come.

Object. Faith is also of things to come: for we believe eternal life.

Answ. Faith gives (...). Heb. 11. 1.
a subsistence, and present being, to such things as are to come; by it we
believe those good things which are promised to be ours, though the possession
of them be to come.

3 In their nature: Faith believes the very truth of Gods promises, and Ioh.
3. 33.
seals that God is true: Hope waits till God manifest and accomplish his
truth.

Thus we see that Hope is a different and distinct grace from Faith: yea so, as
it may be of use when faith fails: and it serves to cherish and uphold
Faith: needful it is therefore that unto Faith it be added.

. 7. Of the resemblance betwixt Hope and an Helmet.
FItly is Hope resembled to an Helmet, III. Point. How fitly Hope is resembled
to an Helmet.
which, according to the notation of the (...).
Greek word, covers the head all over, so as under it may be comprised the
Beuer, and whatsoever covers the face. The use of this Helmet is to keep and
fence the head safe from Arrows, Darts, Bullets, Swords and other weapons,
whereby it might otherwise be sorely wounded, and the man be killed downright.

He that has his head and face well and safely covered, will be bold and
courageous without fear, lifting up his head, and looking his enemy in the
face, and so boldly go on forward, not fearing Arrows, Darts, or any such
things that shall be shot, or thrown at him. Even so he whose soul is
established with Hope, waiting for Salvation in the end, will with an holy
resolution go on in his course to God, not fearing the manifold assaults of
his spiritual enemies, being assured that they shall not pierce his soul, but
that at length he shall remain a Victorer, when the Devil and his instruments
have shot all their Arrows against him. Hope of Salvation makes a man rouse
up his soul and spirit in the midst of temptations: thus much the notation of
that (...). Romans 8. 19.
word, whereby the Apostle sets forth the Hope and earnest expectation of
the creature, implies. David alludeth heereunto, saying, Vide Beza. annotat.
Unto thee, O Lord, lift I up my soul: And again, I will lift up mine eyes to
the mountain, Psalm. 25. 1. and 121. 1.
from whence my help comes.

Out of all that has been said, may easily be gathered what is the use of
hope, and how needful and profitable a piece of Armor it is.

. 8. Of the use of Hope.
THe use of it is to keep us from fainting, that we be not confounded through
any assaults of our enemies: for Romans 5. 5:
Hope makes not ashamed, but makes bold and confident: Psalm. 27. 13. 14.
David implies that he had fainted, but for his hope, and thereupon exhorts
others to Hope in the Lord. In this respect, Heb. 6. 19.
the Apostle uses another metaphor, and resembles Hope to an Anchor. Sicut
anchora iactata de naui non permittit came circu^ferri, licet venticommoueant,
sed firmam facit, ficet spes. Chry. in Heb. hom. 11
When Mariners have a good sound Anchor fast tied to the ship with a strong
Cable, and fast fixed on firm ground, they dare sleep quietly therein, though
storms and tempests arise: for the Anchor will keep the ship safe and sure,
so as it cannot be carried away of winds, nor beaten against rocks, nor
swallowed of gulfes. Thus does Hope after an holy manner make us secure, and
that though afflictions and temptations like storms, be raised against us.
Psalm. 23. 4.
Though I should walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear
no evil, says David; whereby he manifests his holy security, which also he
does by many other like speeches in his Psalms.

. 9. Of the need of Hope, in regard of the uncertain and long date of Gods
promises.
THis being the use of Hope, IIII. Point. Hope necessary in four respects.
it is very needful, yea necessary, and that in four respects.

1 In regard of the time which God has set down for the accomplishment of his
promises, 1 Time uncertain.
which time is often both unknown, and long dated, though the time be of God
certainly determined, so as it cannot be prevented, (Ioh. 7. 30.) nor shall be
ouerpassed, (Hab. 2. 3.) yet Mar. 13. 32. Act. 1. 7.
it is not always made known unto us. It is therefore needful that we wait
for the time of the accomplishment of them. Such a collection does Christ
himself infer upon such a ground: Mar. 13. 33.
Take heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. And excellently
does he exemplify it by the Luke 12. 36, etc.
parable of the servants that waited while their Master returned from the
wedding.

In wisdom also it pleases God many times to set a long date to the
accomplishment of his promises. When Genesis 12. 7.
Abraham came out of Haran, then God promised seed unto him, and a blessing
upon his seed, yet was and 21. 5.
Abraham an hundred years old before he had a child of Sarah: so there passed
at least twenty five years betwixt the making and performing of this promise,
(compare Genesis 12. 4. and 21: 5.) yet Romans 4. 18.
above Hope, under Hope, did he wait for it. Luke 2. 25, etc.
The promise which was made to Simeon was not accomplished till he was an old
man, ready to die; yet he continued to wait. There passed almost four thousand
years betwixt that time. Genesis 3. 15.
wherein the blessed seed of the woman was first promised, and Luke 2. 1. etc.
wherein he was exhibited. There have passed above five thousand years since
Jude v. 14.
the time that the glorious coming of Christ unto judgment was promised, and
yet is not accomplished, and God knows when it shall be. The date of many
promises, are much longer then the Saints thought of: and they are kept longer
in suspense then they looked for. In this respect there is great need of Hope,
yea of patient Hope. Note the answer given to the souls under the Altar, which
was, Reu. 6. 10. 11 Dei promissis credere debemus etiamsi multum temporis
interfluat. Chrysostom. in Genesis hom. 39.
That they should rest till their fellow servants, and their brethren that
should be killed even as they were, were fulfilled.

The office of Hope, is to make us wait, and still to wait, and that with
patience, though God tarry never so long, Though it tarry, wait, (Hab. 2. 3.)
David waited though his soul fainted. (Psalm. 119. 81.)

. 10. Of the need of Hope in regard of troubles.
2 IN regard of those many troubles and perplexities which do fall out betwixt
the making and accomplishing of Gods promises, 2 Troubles many.
we have a great need of Hope. Exodus 5. 7.
After that God had promised Canaan to Israel, Israel was in miserable bondage
before he possessed Canaan: yea, after God had sent Moses to tell them that the
promised time of their deliverance was come, they were more cruelly oppressed,
before they could get out; and when they were got out, what and how many
streights were they brought unto at the red sea, and in the wilderness before
they entered into Canaan? even such and so many, as of all the men which came
out of Egypt, only two (which patiently waited to the end,) entered into it.
David was promised to have the Kingdom of Israel: but how was he persecuted,
and made to fly the Country before he was crowned? How often were the people of
God made a prey to their enemies, and scorned among the nations before the
promised Messiah was exhibited? What desolations has the Church been brought
unto (it has been like the Moon in the deepest waine) and yet Christ not come?

Thus does the Lord in wisdom dispose of his Church while it is here warfaring
on earth; as for many other just and weighty reasons, so to try if we can
wait, patiently wait, and that Romans 4. 18.
under Hope, though it be above Hope. In regard of these troubles, therefore is
Hope very needful, as Heb. 10. 35. etc.
the Apostle implies, who earnestly exhorts the Hebrews, even in this
respect to wait. It is the office of Hope, to make us wait and abide til God
remove the cross.

. II. Of the need of Hope in regard of the scoffs of the wicked.
3 HOpe is needful in regard of the scoffs and reproaches of the wicked: 3
Wicked scoff.
for if Gods promises be not speedily accomplished, 2 Pet. 3. 4.
they are ready to vpbraide Gods children, and say, Where are his promises? If
afflictions befall them, Psalm. 42. 10.
Where is their God? If afflictions be grievous, and 3. 2.
There is no help for him in God. Is not then Hope necessary to uphold us
against these? David hereby vpheld himself: for when the wicked said, Where is
their God, he said to his Soul, and 42. 11.
Wait on God.

It is the office of Hope to make us look so much the more steadfastly upon
God, and the faster to cleave unto him, by how much the more wicked men do
seek to draw us from the Lord.

. 12. Of the need of Hope in regard of our own weakness.
4 WE have need of Hope, 4 we weak.
in regard of our own weakness, for we are very prone by nature to think
that God forgets us, and remembers not his promises made to us, if at least
it be a long time before he accomplish them; or if he bring us to any
streights, and seem to hide his face from us. David was herewith sorely
tempted, it made him cry out, and say, Psalm. 13. 1.
How long will thou forget me, O Lord, for ever? How long will thou hide thy
face from me? But what vpheld him? himself shows that it was his hope* For
in the same Psalm he says, Psalm. 13. 5.
I trust in thy mercy.

It is the office of Hope in this respect, to make us hope above hope, as Romans
4. 8.
Abraham; and against sense, as Job 13. 15.
Job.

Thus we see that hope is so needful, as there is no living in this world
without it: herein is the proverb verified, If it were not for hope the heart
would break.

. 13. Of getting and preserving Hope.
LEt us therefore in the next place observe how it may be, V. Point. How hope
is gotten.
first, gotten, secondly, preserved, thirdly, well used.

1 It is gotten by the same means that faith is: for it is the daughter of
Faith. See Treat. 2. part. 6. and. 17. etc.
The means which beget faith, do immediately hereupon beget hope.

2 It is preserved by two means especially. 2. How preserved.


1. By a due consideration and full persuasion of Gods properties; which make us
patiently abide for the accomplishment of his promises.

2 By a faithful remembrance of Gods former dealings.

Four special properties of God are for this purpose to be observed. 1. His
free grace. 2. His infinite power. 3. His infallible truth. 4. His unsearchable
wisdom.

For being in our hearts persuaded by faith. 1. Faith in Gods promises
vpholdeth hope.
First, That the same grace which moved God to make any gracious promise, will
further move him to accomplish it. And secondly, That he is able to do it.
And thirdly, So faithful, that not a word which he has said shall fall to the
ground: Yea, and fourthly, That he is most wise in appointing the fittest times
and seasons for all things, so as may most make to his own glory, and his
childrens good; we are thus brought to wait, and to continue waiting on God
(without prescribing any time to him) till he has actually performed what he
faithfully promised.

. 14. Of Experience nourishing Hope.
GODS former dealings both with others, 2 Experience vpholdeth Hope.
and also with our selves being faithfully remembered, work such an Romans 5. 4.
experience as cannot but bring forth Hope: For this experience does evidently
demonstrate what God is willing and able to do. Psalm. 22. 4. and 34. 6. and
143. 5.
Hereby was David's Hope much cherished and strengthened. Iam. 5. 11.
This means does St James use to strengthen the hope of Christian Jews,
bringing to their memories Gods dealing with Job.

For this end, we must acquaint our selves with the Histories of former times,
especially such as are recorded in the holy Scriptures: for Romans 15. 4.
Whatsoever things are written before time (namely in those Scriptures) are
written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
Scriptures might have Hope. It is also good to be acquainted with other
Ecclesiastical Histories: but especially to observe Gods dealings in our own
times.

The Romans 5. 4.
experience which most of all brings forth Hope, is that which we have of
Gods dealing with our selves, whereof we have two notable examples, one of
Jacob, (Ge^. 32. 10.) The other of David, (1 Samuel 17. 37.)

For this end we are well to observe and remember all those gracious favors
which God from time to time vouchsafes to us, and not carelessly let them slip
at the time present, nor negligently forget them in the time past. The
Israelites in the wilderness failed in both these: Psalm. 106. 7.
They understood not Gods wonders, while God was doing them; neither afterward
did they remember the multitude of Gods mercies. This was the cause that they
could not wait till the time appointed for their entering into Canaan was come:
but fainted, and fell in the Wilderness.

. 15. Of meditating on the end of Hope.
TO these may be added as a further means to uphold and cherish Hope, Often
meditate of the end of Hope.
a serious and frequent meditation of the end of our Hope, Si vis sustinere
laborem, attend mercedem. Aug. in Psalm. 36
namely, that rich and glorious inheritance which Christ has purchased for his
Saints, and God has promised unto them. Much might be said to amplify this
point, but I will refer it to the private meditation of the Reader: and let
it the rather be meditated of, because we see the hopes of worldly men to be
sustained with matters which are no way comparable hereunto. Observe what their
hope is in earthly things, which are very uncertain: Iam. 5. 7.
The husbandman waits for the fruit of the earth, and has long patience for
it, until he receive the former and the latter rain. As the Husbandman, so
the Soldier, the Mariner, the Merchant, who not? Their hopes make them vnter
much, and send themselves forth to great dangers, and yet often they fail of
their hopes. Shall Christians of all others cast away their Hope, the end
whereof is more excellent then all things in Sea and Land, which also they are
sure to receive, if they faint not? Heb. 10. 35.
Cast not away your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.

. 16. Of the resemblance betwixt Hope and an Anchor.
3 THe use of hope may fi^ly be set forth by that other metaphor whereunto Hope
is resembled, 3. How hope is well used.
namely, an Anchor. ( Heb. 6. 19.)

1 It must be cast upon a sure ground. 1 Cast the anchor of hope on a sure
ground.
If an anchor becast into a bottomless sea, where is no ground, or on quick
sands, which are no sure ground, it is of no use, the ship may be tossed up
and down, and suffer wrack for all that. The only sure ground of hope is
Gods promise revealed in his Word. That this is a most firm ground cannot be
doubted of, unless the goodness, power and faithfulness of God be called
into question. For as God himself is, so is his* Word, faithful and true,
sure and certain: nothing more firm and stable: Matthew. 5. 18.
Till heaven and earth perish, one jot or title of Gods word shall not escape,
till all things be fulfilled. Psalm. 119. 19.
David cast the anchor of his hope upon this ground. We are therefore to
acquaint our selves with Gods manifold promises.

2 It must be fast fixed on that sure ground. 2, Fast fix it on that ground.
If an anchor only lie upon the ground, and be not fixed on it, as good be
without ground.

Then is hope fast fixed on Gods promise, when his promise is steadfastly
believed: Faith makes a way and entrance for hope. Romans 4. 18, etc.
Abraham first believed Gods promise, and then waited for it.

First therefore labor for true and sound faith in Gods promises, then will thy
hope be sure and steadfast.

3 It must often be settled and fixed anew. 3. Of^ renew, the hold.
If an Anchor loose and slacken after it has once been fastened, a storm may
cartie the ship away: where then is the benefit of the former fastening? Our
hope in regard of our own weakness, and the violence of Satan's manifold
storms, is much subject to loosening, to wavering. It must therefore often be
renewed: Isa. 40. 31.
They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. These words may be
taken both as a promise of God, showing what he will do; and as a duty on our
part, showing what we ought to do.

For this end, again and again meditate on those promises which we have once
known and believed, and often call to mind Gods former benefits and performance
of his promises: (these were David's usual practices.) For these being means
to raise up Hope in us at first, the recalling of them to our minds again,
must needs be means to renew our hope.

. 17. Answer to Satan's suggestion against a sure ground of Hope.
IN the last place, VI. Point. Satan's wiles.
Satan has many ways to spoil us of this piece of Armor also, and that
either by laboring to keep it from us, that we never have it, or to wrest it
from us after we have it.

Because there is a mutual relation betwixt Faith and Hope, so as without
Faith there can be no Hope, he bends what forces he can against Faith to keep
us from it, or deprive us of it. To avoid this, the former Treatise of Faith
is to be observed.

His Suggestions more proper against this grace, are such as these.

Suggest. 1 There needs no such ado to find out a sure ground; if thou hope
well, it is well enough. Thus he prevails with the greater sort of our
people, especially with the more ignorant and ruder sort, who do not only in
their hearts conceive, but with their tongues also are ready to utter such
conceits as these, I hope well, yea, I hope to be saved as well as the best.
Here is their anchor cast out. But ask them, what is the ground of their Hope,
all the answer they can give, is, They Hope well. Many that know not the
fundamental points of Christian Religion, nor the first grounds of Salvation,
(being much worse then the Heb. 5. 12.
Hebrews, of whom the Apostle complains that they had need be taught which
are the first principles of the Oracles of God) will yet say, I hope well.

Answer. To avoid this, all ignorant persons, though they be grown in years,
must be willing to be instructed and even catechized. (...). Luke 1. 4.
Theophilus a Nobleman was so instructed. Ministers must use to catechize and
teach fundamental grounds. Ignorance of people is a shame and dishonor to the
Gospel; it makes them a prey to Satan, and Ose. 4. 1. 2 These. 1. 8.
brings them to the very pit and gulf of destruction.

. 17. Answer to Satan's suggestion of false grounds of Hope.
Suggest. 2. THe best grounds of Hope are, 1. A man's own merits. 2. The
meritorious works of others, even their works of supererogation, 3. A^ man's
own honest dealing and good meaning: 4. A man^ prosperous estate. Thus he
deceives men with fal^ grounds. In the first of these, he prevails with the
prou^der sort of Papists, who trust to their own merits. In the second, with
the more silly and foolish sort, who trust t^ the merits of others: In the
third, with many among^ counted civil, honest men, men of their words, just i^
their dealings, etc. but savor of little piety to Go^ wards: as also in many
of the poorer sort, who think an^ say. They do no man any wrong. In the
fourth, with sottish worldlings; who make Earth their Heaven.

Answer. All these are like quicke-sands, which bring more danger then safety
to a ship.

For the first, see the answer to the first suggestion against righteousness..
7.

For the second, see the 3. use of the 2. Doctrine, on verse 10.. 5.

For the third, remember

1 That all the honest dealing in the World, without Faith, is nothing
acceptable to God, ( Heb. 11. 6.)

2 That good meanings and intentions may stand with most abominable impieties
and iniquities. For proof whereof, read John 16. 2. and Acts 26. 9.

3 That it more beseems fools then wise men to build all their hopes upon
conjectures.

For the fourth, know that outward prosperity, wealth, health, honor, credit,
^auour of friends, and the like, are but Mat. 5. 45.
common gifts which God indifferently bestows on all sorts of people: they
often prove the Devils baits to allure men unto him, and his hooks to hold them
fast, and drown them in perdition.

. 18. Answer to Satan's suggestion of licentious trusting on Mercy.
3. Suggest. STill trust to Gods Mercy, and Hope therein; and in confidence
thereof, take liberty ^othy self to do what seems good in thine own eyes.
Thus he makes carnal Gospellers, Libertines, hypo^rites, and the like, (
Jude; v. 5.
Who turn the grace of God into wan^nnesse) to let their anchor of Hope lie
loose upon the ^re ground of Gods mercy.

Answer. When Gods mercy is wilfully and wittingly abused, his justice is
provoked to take vengeance: Gods grace gives liberty to no sin, Tit. 2. 11.
12.
The grace of God which brings salvation unto all men, teaches us to deny
ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, godly, etc:
This is the end of grace, and this also will be the power and efficacy thereof
in all to whom it belongs: for they who partake of the merit of Christ's
sacrifice to have their sins pardoned, partake also of the efficacy thereof,
to have the power of sin subdued.

. 19. Of Satan's seeking to deprive us of the use of Hope.
IF thus the Devil cannot keep us from attaining true Hope, then will he
labor to quail our Hope, and so spoil us of it, and that by these and such
like means.

1 By making us too careless, and too secure, wherein he somewhat prevailed
with Lot, David, Peter, and such other.

For avoiding this, we must duly consider our own weakness, and the many
fierce temptations whereunto we are subject, and thereby be stirred up to watch
and pray, as Mat. 26. 41.
Christ upon this ground exhorts his disciples.

2 By moving us to despair, by reason of our unworthiness: and here he will
object what we are by nature, what by the multitude and greeuousnesse of our
actual transgressions, and in these respects how unworthy of the salvation
which we wait for.

For avoiding this, we must remove our eyes from off our selves, and cast them
upon the free grace, and rich mercy of God, and upon the all-sufficient merit
of Christ, and remember that the salvation which God has promised, he will
give for his own Names sake.

3 By calling into question the truth of Gods promises, especially when he
seems long to delay the accomplishment of them, or when troubles arise.

For avoiding this, we must be persuaded, that God is wisest, and best knows
the fittest times and means for accomplishing his promises.

THE EIGHTH PART.
The Sword of the Spirit.
Ephesians. 6. 17. And the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
. 1. Of adding a Sword to other pieces of Armor.
THe sixth and last piece of Armor, is not only defensive as all the former,
but offensive also, like a Sword. (...).
Note this copulative particle AND, and the Sword; that is, take the Sword also
as well as other pieces of Armor: Whence observe that

It is not enough to keep off our enemies assaults, Doct. Drive away thy
spiritual enemies.
from annoying us, but our care and endeavor must be to drive them away, and
destroy them. Iam. 4. 7.
Resist the Devil (says the Apostle) and he shall fly. Resist, is a word not
only of defense, but also of offense. This phrase, he shall fly, shows that
our endeavor must be to drive him away, and put him to flight. It implies
both a promise and a duty. To this purpose tend those phrases in Scripture of
(...). Col. 3. 5.
killing our members on earth, (...). Romans 8. 13.
mortifying the deeds of the body, Gal. 5. 24.
crucifying the flesh and the world, Romans 6. 6.
destroying the body of sin, 1 Cor. 9. 27.
beating down the body, and keeping it in subjection. We have a notable
example hereof in our Head and General Christ, Mat. 4. 10.
who put the Devil to flight: likewise in one of his Captains, S. Paul, 1
Cor. 9. 27.
who brought his body into subjection, and Gal. 6. 14.
to who the world was crucified.

If we stand only upon defense, we embolden and hearten our enemies, Reason.
wh^ will never leave assaulting us, till they have preauiled against us,
except they be destroyed; as Saul never left persecuting David, till he
himself was destroyed.

Magistrates must cut off the enemies of the church
heretics, atheists, worldlings, and the like enemies, but that they cut off
and destroy those dangerous and mischievous enemies. For this purpose the sword
of God is committed into their hands: and Romans 13. 4.
They are the Ministers of God, to take vengeance on such as do evil. 2 Kin.
23. 20.
Thus did that good King Josiah, and other good Kings.

Object. This is done by the temporal sword, but what is that to the Sword of
the Spirit here meant?

Answ. 1 It may fitly be applied by way of allusion.

2 It follows by just and necessary consequence: for every one must do his
best to profligate spiritual enemies: and seeing God has afforded to
Magistrates not only the spiritual Sword which is common to all Christians,
but also a temporal Sword which is proper to the^, they must use both.

3 The use of the temporal Sword is a great help to the spiritual, The use
of the temporal sword an help to the spiritual.
and much good may be done thereby: for howsoever Satan himself, being a
Spirit, is no whit danted with the temporal Sword: yet idolaters, heretics,
profane men, and other like instruments of the devil, in, and by whom the
devil much annoyeth the Church of God, are danted, and may be destroyed
thereby, and so Satan put to flight. It is the overthrow and ruin of many
Churches, that the civil Governors suffer the enemies thereof to get head, and
assault the church and people of God.

2 Ministers must resute error, and reprove vice.
instruct in good manners, encourage the upright, but also refute errors, cut
down sin, and endeavor to destroy whatsoever makes against the glorious
Gospel of Christ. Note what the Apostle says in this case, 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6.
The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God to cast down holds, casting
down the imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the
knowledge of God, etc. and having vengeance ready against all disobedience.
That we may not think that this was proper to his Apostolical function, Tit.
1. 9.
he says in general of a Bishop, that as he must be able to exhort with
wholesome doctrine, so to improve them that say against it. There is a two
edged Sword put into the mouths of ministers, they must accordingly use it, to
defend by teaching sound doctrine, and instructing in good manners: to offend by
confuting errors, and reproving sins. Many errors in judgment, and much
corruption in life creeps into the Church for want hereof.

3 Private Christians must subdue their enemies
oppose against the world, subdue their flesh, strike and fight: it is a
foolish pity to spare the enemy, and destroy a man's self. If Satan tempt,
with an holy indignation, bid him avoid: if the world allure, defy it: if the
flesh lust, sub due it.

Thus much for the connection of this Weapon with the former pieces of Armor. I
will now distinctly handle it, and show

1 What this Weapon is.

2 How fitly resembled to a Sword, and why called the Sword of the Spirit.

3 How it may be taken and used.

4 What is the benefit of well using it.

5 What are the sleights of Satan to deprive us of it.

. 2. Of the true Word of God.
THe Weapon here prescribed, 1. Point. What is the Word of God
is expressly termed the Word of God, which is that part of Gods will which in
the holy Scripture he caused to be recorded. It is called (...).
Word, because by it Gods will is manifested and made known, even as a man
makes known his mind and will by his words.

It is also said to be the Word of God in regard,

1 Of the Author, which is 2 Timothy 3. 16.
God himself.

2 Of the matter, which is Ephe. 1. 9.
Gods will.

3 Of the end, which is Gods and 3. 10.
glory.

4 Of the efficacy, which is Gods Romans 1. 16.
power.

This word is properly and truly the right sense and meaning of the Scripture:
Not the letter but the sense is Gods word.
for except that be found out, in many words there may seem to be matter of
falsehood, (as that Mar. 13. 32.
the Son knows not the day of judgment,) of heresy (as that the Father is
greater then the Son) and contradiction, Ioh. 14. 28. ^
as betwixt that which Christ said ( my Father is greater then I,) and that
which the Apostle said, (that Phil. 2. 6.
Christ Jesus thought it no robbery to be equal with God.)

The letter of Scripture may be alleged, and yet the word of God missed, as by
all her etiques. And a man may swerve from the letter, and yet allege the true
word of God, as the Evangelists and Apostles did many times.

Compare Mic. 5. 2 Psalm. 40. 6. with Mat. 2. 6. Heb. 10. 5.




So may diverse translaters differ in some words and phrases* and Preachers in
alleging testimonies of the Scripture may miss of the just letters, and yet
all retain the true word of God, which is the true sense rightly conceived,
and rightly applied.

This therefore is it which we must labor after, Use. Search out the sense of
Scripture. (...).
and that with care and diligence, as Christ implies, where he commands to
Ioh. 5. 39.
search the Scriptures. The word which he uses, is metaphorical, taken from
such as use to search in Mines for silver and gold: they will dig deep, they
will break the several clots of earth all to pieces, to find out the golden
Oar. Singuli sermones, syllabae, apices, puncta in diuinis scripturisplena
sunt sensibus Hier. in Ephesians. 3.
Thus must we deal with the Scriptures, as we are exhorted by Christ, ( Ioh.
5. 39.) and by Solomon ( Pro. 2. 4.) and so much the rather because every
sentence, syllable, letter and tittle in holy Scripture is of moment. Otherwise
if we do not thus search the Scriptures, instead of Gods word we may allege
our own conceits.

. 3. Of the means to find out the true sense of the Scripture.
FOr our help in finding out the true sense of Scripture, there are diverse
profitable means, as

1 Understanding of the original tongues: Vide Aug* de doct. Chr. l. 3. c. 24,
25. etc.
diverse errors and heresies have been drawn from translations. It is likely
that the first thing that moved Papists to make marriage a Sacrament, was the
word Sacramentum which the vulgar translation uses Ephesians. 5. 32. and which the
Rh^mist; translate a Sacrament. But (...).
the original, signifies a mystery, or secret.

Besides, every language has proper kinds of speeches, which being translated
word for word, in other languages would seem obsurd: so that for the true
understanding of the propriety of many Scripture phrases, knowledge of the
original tongues is needful.

2 Skill in the Arts, whereby proper and figurative phrases may be discerned
and distinguished, and whereby the true construction of words, and just
consequence of arguments may be observed.

These especially are for the learned, wherein the valearned, must seek the
help of the learned.

3 Knowledge of the Analogy of Faith, that is, of the fundamental points of
our Christian religion, that no sense be made contrary to any of them. The
literal acceptance of these words, Mat. 26. 26.
This is my body, and the heresy of Transubstantiation grounded thereon, is
contrary to the sixth article of our Creed, He ascended into heaven, and fitteth
at the right hand of God, etc.

4 Observation of the scope, of that place which is interpreted, and of the
circumstances going before, and following after. Thus may the true meaning of
that parable touching the Samaritan, Luke 10. 30. etc
which showed mercy to the man wounded and half dead, be easily found out.

5 Comparing one place with another. Thus the meaning of many types and
prophesies in the old Testament, may be understood by the application of them
in the New. By comparing obscure places with perspicuous places, the obscure
will be made perspicuous.

6 Prayer. Agant orando and quaerendo and been viuendo vt intelligant, Aug. de
Trin. l. 3. c. 17 2 These. 2. 10. 11.
For thereby the Spirit of revelation, whereof the Apostle speaks ( Ephesians. 1.
17.) is obtained* therefore David prays unto God to open his eyes that he may
see the wonders of Gods Law, ( Psalm. 119. 18.)

7 Faith and obedience to Gods word, so far as it is made known: God gives
over such to believe lies, who receive not, or love not the truth.

. 4. Of the resemblance betwixt the word of God and a Sword.
A Sword, II. Point. How fitly Gods word is compared to a sword.
whereunto the word is compared, has a double use: one to defend a man from
the assaults of his enemies; (they who can well use a sword, find a great use
hereof, even in this respect.) The other is to annoy, drive back, and destroy
a man's enemy. 2 Samuel 23. 10
This double use did Eleazar one of David's Worthies make of his sword, (which
he used so long, that it claue to his hand again,) he defended himself and
the Israelites, and destroyed the Philistims therewith.

Thus the word of God is of great use, both to defend ^s from all the assaults
of our spiritual enemies, and also ^o drive away, confound, and destroy them.
It is profita^le for doctrine and reproof, for instruction and correction, (2.
Tim. 3. 16.)

This is evident by Christ's manner of using the Word ^n his conflict with
Satan: by it he did defend himself against the Mat. 4. 4.
first, and 7.
second assault, and 10.
by it in the ^hird, he drove the devil away. Thus he used it afterward in
his conflicts with Scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, and others. When any thing
was objected against Christ, ^sually he Mat. 12. 3, 5.
defended himself with the Scriptures, and with the Scriptures he and 22, 32,
44.
confounded them: so did Act. 7. 1. etc.
Ste^hen, and 18. 28.
Apollos, and all the Apostles.

By the Word also may all carnal and fleshly lusts be cut down and subdued;
Gladius dicitur sermo diuinus quia sicut gladius carnes praecidit. sic and
sermo diuinus concupis^^ntias carnales. Chrysostom. in Mat. hom. 8.
as flesh may be cut in pieces by a sword.

Wherefore as Gentlemen, soldiers, and travelers, always have their swords
by their sides, or in their hands ready to defend themselves, and to spoil
their enemies, so ought we always to have this sword in readiness. Let us
show our selves as wise and careful for the safety of our souls, as natural
men for their bodies.

. 5. Why the Word is called a Sword of the Spirit.
the Sword of the Spirit, as in regard of the 2 Pet. 1. 21.
Author of it, which is the holy Spirit, so also of the nature and kind of it:
for it is Spiritual: and so opposed to a material sword made of metal:
which may be called the sword of flesh. To this purpose, the Apostle says, 2
Cor. 10. 4.
The weapons of our warfare are not carnal: (not carnal, is in effect as much
as Spiritual.) Hence is it that it is so Heb. 4. 12.
lively and powerful, sharper then any two edged sword, piercing even to the
dividing asunder of sou^ and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
discerner of the thoughts, and intents of the heart. Were it not spiritual, it
could not possibly pierce so deep, it could not discern the thoughts of the
heart: neither could it any way annoy the Devil who is not flesh and blood,
(as we have heard) but a spirit.

Behold Gods goodness and wisdom in furnishing us with such a weapon as our
greatest enemies, even they who are not flesh and blood, do dread: and that not
without cause, because it is of power to confound them. So as if we be wise,
skillful and careful in using i^ we 1 Pet. 3. 14.
need not fear their fear, nor be troubled: Phil. 1. 28:
but we shall rather strike dread and terror into them.

. 6. Of the means of well using the Word.
FOr the well using of this Spiritual Sword, 3. Point. Four graces needful
to use the word aright. 1 Knowledge.
four especial graces are needful. First, Knowledge. Secondly, Wisdom.
Thirdly, Faith. Fourthly, Obedience.

1 For Knowledge, In all things that we do, we must by the Word understand and
know what God says; what is his good will, pleasing and acceptable to him: for
which we have both the practice of the Psalmist ( Psalm. 85. 8:) and the
precept of the Apostle ( Rom 12. 2. Ephesians. 5. 17.) For by the holy Scriptures
only and alone we may attain to the knowledge of the whole will of God. Per
scripturas solas potes plenam dei intelligere voluntatem. Hier. ad Demet.
Without knowledge of Gods truth we shall be always wauening, and never
established in any truth, whether it concern judgment or practice; nor yet
with courage resist any contrary corruption.

. 7. Of the means to attain Knowledge by the Word.
FOr this, observe these directions.

(...). 1 Timothy 4. 13
Give attendance thereunto: and that not only with others, but also alone with
thy self, that thou may better observe it. Have set times for this end, and
be constant in observing them: if by any urgent occasions thy task be omitted
at one time, double it another time.

2 Ios. 1, 8
Meditate of that which thou have read. Psalm. 119. 97
Meditati^n is an especial means to help both understanding and memory. A
thing at first reading is not so well conceived (...) when it is seriously
pondered: this serious pondering ^aketh a deep impression of it in our
memories.

3 Attend to the preaching of Gods Word: and bring thereunto a mind willing to
learn. This is Gods ordinance, in the use whereof we may well wait and depend
upon God for his blessing, and that,

1 To enlighten our understanding.

2 To work upon our affections.

3 To teach us how to apply it.

. 8. Of Wisdom in applying the Word.
2 FOr Wisdom; 2 Wisdom.
It teaches us rightly to apply the Word, and that both in the true sense and
meaning of that particular place which we allege, and also according to the
present matter for which it is alleged.

If we miss of the meaning of the place, it is no word of God, but a conceit
of our own brain: 2 Pet. 3. 16.
We pervert the Scripture to our own destruction. If it be not pertinent to
the matter, it is as a plaster or a medicine wrongly applied, which heals
when it should draw, and so causes inward festering: or draws when it should
heal, and so makes the sore or wound much worse. A potion mistaken, often
kills the patient. Even so, if the terrors of the Law be urged to a wounded
conscience, they may dri^ a man into utter despair: or if the sweet promises
of the Gospel be applied to profane Libertines, and carnall^ Gospellers, they
may make them highly and intolerably^ presume. Nothing can be more pernicious
then the wor^ wrongly applied. It is like 2 Samuel 1. 12.
Saul's sword, which never ve^ned empty from the blood of the slain: when it
was held o^ against the enemies, it destroyed them; when Saul himself fell
upon it, it run into his own bowels, it kille^ him. So the Word well used
against our spiritual en^mies, destroys them: if we fall on it our selves,
it m^ be the death of our souls: for it is 2 Cor. 2. 16.
either the savor of death, or the savor of life. Needful it is then that
unto knowledge wisdom be added, that we may rightly apply it.

For this end we must observe, as the true meaning of the place it self, so
the occasion, matter, and end why it is alleged, that so fit and pertinent
places may be alleged. Thus did Christ use the Word: he alleged Mat. 4. 4
a most fit text against distrust, so also against (...)
presumption, and against 10.
idolatry.

. 9. Of Faith in Gods Word.
FOr Faith, the power of Gods Word is restrained thereunto: 3 Faith.
for Romans 1. 16.
it is the power of God to every one that be^eeueth. All knowledge and wisdom
without it is in vain Heb. 4. 2.
The Word which the Jews heard, profited them not because it was not mixed
with Faith in them that heard it. Euah under stood Gods Word well enough, and
wisdom she had enough well to apply it; but because she did not steadfastly
believe in it, but was brought to doubt of it, she lost the use of this Sword;
her enemy came in upon her, and killed her.

For this end the authority of the Scriptures is well to be noted: Quod
diuinarum scripturarum perspicua firmatur authoritate sine vlla dubitatio ne
credendum est. Aug. ep. 1^ 2
they are of divine authority (2 Timothy 3. 16.) Gods oracles are recorded in
them: not one ^ot or ti^^le of them shall escape till all be fulfilled ( Mat. 5.
18.) This known and believed, will bring us to give full assent to the truth
of them.

. 10. Of yielding obedience to the Word.
FOr Obedience, In Religion a man knows no more then he practices. 4
Obedience.
In this respect it is true, that 1 Cor. 8. 2.
If a man think he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to
know: so as without obedience all knowledge is nothing, Iam. 1. 23, 24
as Saint James declares by a fit comparison taken from one that beholds his
face in a glass, and forgets what manner of one he was. This therefore must
be added to all the rest; and herein we must be careful that Deu^. 5. 32
we turn neither to the right hand, nor to the left: neither carelessly neglect
that which is commanded, nor preposterously do that which is forbidden. Thus
John 13. 17
blessed are they which know, if they do the things which they know. In this
experimental knowledge consists the very power of this spiritual Sword: by
it is lust subdued, the world crucified unto us, and the Devil driven away.

. 11. Of the manifold use of Gods Word.
The benefit of well using the word. Non nouimus clios libros ita destruentes
superbiam* ita des^ruentes inimicum, etc. Aug. Confess: lib. 13.
is admirable: for there is no error in judgment but may be refuted, no
corruption in life but may be redressed hereby: Neither is there any true sound
doctrine but may be proved and maintained against all gaine-sayers, or any
virtue and duty but may be warranted by it, and we thereby directed also in
the performance thereof. 2 Timothy 3. 16
The Apostle expressly says of the Word, that it is profitable to all these:
Psalm. 119. 98, 99, 100.
David upon his own experience affirms that by Gods Word he was made wiser
then the Ancient, then his Teachers, then his Enemies. Ancient men who have
much experience of many times, and of many things done in those times, commonly
get much wisdom by their long experience; so as Job 11. 12.
among the ancient is wisdom, and in the length of days is understanding.
Yet Gods Word taught David to understand more then experience could teach the
ancient. Yea, though Teachers commonly know more then Scholars, or learners, (
Mal. 2. 7.
Their lips should preserve knowledge:) yet David by Gods Word exceeded all his
Teachers in knowledge. And though enemies through their continall searching
after sundry points of policy, and inuenting many stratagems and cunning
wyles, as also by prying into the attempts of the adverse parties, grow very
subtle and crafty; yet by this Word of God did David learn more wisdom then
all they. For Gods Word is of a far larger extent then man's wit, wisdom,
learning, and experience can attain unto. Though the Book wherein Gods Word
is contained, be not comparable in multitude of letters, sillables, and words,
to the massy Volumes of many men's works; yet for substance of sound matter,
and variety of several and sundry directions, all the Books in the World are
not comparable to it. Every good thing whatsoever may be justified thereby:
every evil thing whatsoever may be disproued thereby: so as by this Sword
every good thing which is opposed against may be maintained, and every evil
thing whereunto we are tempted, be repelled. There is no cross under which any
man lies, no distress whereunto any is brought, but may be eased, and helped
by Gods Word: from it may sound comfort be fetched, by it may a man be
supported. Psalm. 119. 50
This was David's comfort in his trouble. Art thou afflicted in body, or
troubled in conscience? Are thy Children, kinsfolk, or any other which thou
accountest near and dear unto thee, a vexation unto thee? Is thy estate
decayed? Art thou troubled with evil men, or any other way distressed? Search
the Scriptures: therein shall thou find comfort enough, if rightly thou can
apply them.

In a word, this Word of God is to the blind Psa. 119. 105.
a Light: to them that wander, 9.
a Guide: to them that are in distress, 50.
a Comfort: to them that doubt, 24
a Counselor: to the unlearned Pro. 1. 4.
a Teacher: And what is it not? it is all things to all men.

The word an excellent weapon.
What account ought we to make of it? How expert ought we to be in it?
Whosoever carelessly neglects it, or lightly esteems it, is most ungrateful
to God, who in wisdom and goodness has provided it for him; and most
injurious to himself, in losing the use and benefit of such a weapon.

. 12. Of the wrong which Papists do in detaining the Word.
They are enemies of Gods people, who deprive them of the use of the Word.
who (like the Philistims, 1 Samuel 13. 19. 22.) deprive them of this weapon?
Herein they plainly declare themselves to be servants of Antichrist, and
enemies of Christ. They do even conspire with Satan himself: and so also do
all they which openly or covertly speak against private reading, and public
preaching of the Word; who scoff at that knowledge which lay men and women
have in Gods Word.

. 13. Of neglecting Gods Word.
Who neglect the Word, are enemies to their own soul.
or abuse Gods Word, what enemies are they to their own souls, making way to
their own destruction? too many so do, as

1 They who care not to read it, 1 Who read it not, or hear it not at all.
or hear it at all: of all Books they least respect the Bible. Many will have
Statute Books, Chronicles, yea, Play-bookes, and such like toyish Pamphlets,
but not a Bible in their House or hands: yea, (which is very lamentable) some
Scholars which intend to be Divines, have, and read store of Postils,
Legends, and such like trash, and yet are strangers to the holy Scriptures.
Some use to carry other Books with them to Church, even then to draw away their
minds from hearing Gods Word, when it is read and preached by others. Some go
yet further, and will not suffer their Wives, Children, or other of their
Household to read the Word. And some scoff at such as carry the Scriptures
with them to Church, terming them in reproach, Biblecarriers. All these, and
all other like these, have no sword at all.

2 They who have Bibles, 2. Who seldom read it.
and it may be fairly bound up: but why? only to lie in their house; or to
carry with them to Church: they read it (if at all) as seldom as may be;
their wordly affairs will afford them no time to read the Scripture. How many
be there, that never in their lives read through all the Scriptures, if ever
they read through any one Book? These have a Sword, but to hang by the walls.

3 They who read much; 3 Who search it not.
but only read, never search the Scriptures, to find out the true sense and
meaning of it: much like unto supersticious Papists, who content themselves
with mumbling over at set times a certain number of prayers stinted by their
bead, not regarding what they pray. These have their Sword always in the
scabbard.

4 They who as they read, 4 Who seek not to be edified by it.
so seek for the true sense, but to what end? only to understand the truth of
the History, to reconcile seeming differences, to maintain discourse, or it
may be also to justify the truth of doctrine against gaine-sayers: but not to
be edified in Faith, and to have sin mortified thereby. These draw forth this
sword only to flourish with it.

5 They who in searching out the sense of Scripture, 5. Who neglect the
preaching of it.
trust to their own skill, wit and understanding, and neglect the ministry of
the Word, whereby this sword is (as it were) whetted and made sharp, and they
taught well to use it. These foolish and over bold soldiers care not how
unskillful themselves be, or how blunt their weapon be.

6 They who do all they can to be expert in Gods word, 6. Who use it against
the truth.
but with a traiterous mind to fight against the truth contained therein (as
Heretics;) yea and it may be to overthrow the authority of the word it self
(as many Atheists) These fight with Christ's weapon under Satan's colors against
Christ himself.

. 14. Answer to Satan's suggestion, that the Scripture is not Gods word.
THe chiefest sleights which Satan has to deprive us of this weapon, are
these. V. Point. Satan's wi^es to deprive v^ of the Word.


Sug. 1. There is no such word of God at all: that Scripture which is called
Gods word, was not inspired of God, but so said to be, only to make men to
give greater credence thereto. Thus before Gods word was written, Satan brought
men to doubt of that revelation of Gods will which it pleased God to give to
man, as Genesis 3. ^, 4.
our first parents, and 1. Pet. 3. 19, 20.
the old world. Now it is written, he makes men think it is but as other
writings of man's invention: herewith are not only plain Atheists, but also
many poor distressed wavering souls deceived. 1. Have thy judgment well
informed in the authority of the Scriptures.


Answ. For avoiding this, we must first labor to have our judgments well
informed by what arguments we can, of the divine authority of the Scripture:
many arguments might be alleged to this purpose: but because learned men have
taken good pains herein, Perkins in Prophe, cha. 3. and in cases of consci. l.
2, c. 3.
and published that which they have collected concerning this point, in print,
I will refer the Reader to such books: for they are every where almost to be
had.

Among other arguments this may be one, that not only all sorts of men (as
well wicked and profane, as godly and religious) have an inward fear, and
dread of the Scripture, and bear a great reverence thereunto, but even they
who gainsay the divine authority of Scripture have in their consciences a
secret sting which often pricketh them, and checketh them for it, though they
labor never so much to suppress it

2 We must pray for the Spirit of revelation, or inspiration, 2 Pray for the
spirit of revelation.
which may inwardly testify unto our Spirits and persuade them that God is the
Author of the holy Scriptures. Ephe. 1. 19.
For howsoever many arguments may be brought to euict a man's judgment thereof,
so as in his judgment he cannot gainsay it, yet it is only the inward
testimony of the Spirit, which is able to persuade man's heart thereof, and so
make it willingly embrace and entertain the Scripture as Gods word.

3 We must give no place to doubting about this point, 3 Give no place to
doubting.
but hold it as a principle undeniable. In humane Arts, Audiendi non sunt qui
forte dicerent, vnde scis illos libros vnius very and veracissimi dei Spiritu
esse humano generi ministratos? id ipsum enim maxim credendum erat, etc. Aug.
Consci. l. 6, c. 5.
the Professors thereof teach, that there are some principles which without all
contradiction and question must be taken for granted, so as if any deny them,
he is to be answered with a Cudgel, rather then ^n Argument: for example, if
any deny that the fire is ^ot, it were fitter to thrust his hand or foot into
the (...) while he felt the heat of it, then by reasons ^oue unto him that it
is hot. If any humane Art have ^ch undeniable principles, much more the Art
of ^rtes, Divinity: And in Divinity, of all principles, this is one which least
of all ought to be brought in question, because it is the very groundwork of
all. Wherefore if any such suggestion be cast into our hearts by Satan, let us
with an holy indignation (as Mat. 4. 10.
Christ did when he was tempted to worship the Devil,) bid Satan avoid.

. 15. Answer to Satan's Suggestion of the imperfection of Gods word.
2 Sugg. IT is but a leaden sword, as a nose of wax it may be turned every
way. Pighius, Cusan. in Epist. ad Bohem. 2. and 7.
Heretics, Idolaters, Schismatiques, profane persons, worldlings, yea and the
devil himself turn it to their own turns. Besides, it is so blunt, as it
can neither cut off errors in judgment, nor root out corruptions in life: for
notwithstanding the best application that may be made of Gods word, heretics
remain as perverse in judgment, and wicked men as obstinate in life, as if
this sword had never been used against them. In these has Satan much prevailed
with Papists.

Answ. It is most false that Gods word is either so flexible or so blunt. Gods
word a sure rule.
It is a most Psalm. 19. 7. 8, 9. and 119. 160.
true, right, certain, infallible, undeniable word, always constant, ever one
and the same for ever: so absolutely perfect, as Revel. 22. 18. 19.
nothing can be added to it, or may be taken from it. Gal. 1. 8.
Whosoever teaches any otherwise then it teaches, is accursed. 2 Pet. 1. 19^
Saint Peter terms it, (...).
A more sure word then that divine voice which was heard from heaven at Christ's
tranfiguration: which he does not any whit to extenuate the authority of That,
but the more to commend This unto the Church; so as if a difference could be
made, this written Word of God should have pre-eminence; and so does Ioh. 5.
33. etc.
Christ also seem to prefer it unto the witness of John the Baptist, of his
own works, and of the Father himself.

. 16. Of Heretics falsifying the Word.
THat which Heretics, Haeretici carpunt eloquia scripturarum, et quantum in
se est maculant. Hieron in Ezec. 34.
or other wicked men allege to justify any error in doctrine, or corruption
in life, is only the bare letter of the Word, not the true sense thereof, and
so not the word of God, but conceits of their own brain: for if all the
Scriptures which they allege, be well sifted and thoroughly examined, we shall
find them either mangled, or mingled, perverted or misapplied.

First mangled by leaving out something of moment; Psalm. 91. 11.
as in the text which Satan alleges to Christ, Mat. 4. 6.
he left out this clause, in all thy waves, which had taken away all the force
of his temptation: for it was not Christ's way to fling himself headlong from a
pinnacle, there being other ways and means whereby he might come down: so
Genesis 6. 5.
in the description of a natural man's condition, this word only is left out
in the vulgar Latin translation, whereby they would avoid the text alleged
against their semi-Pelagian opinion of man's being only half dead in sin.
Cuncta cogitatio cordis intenta esset ad malum omni tempore.
So also in Romans 11. 6. this clause is left out, But if it be of works, then is
it no more grace, otherwise work is no work. Which words are a most evident
testimony against merit of works.

2 Mingled, by adding something which may make for them, as the old Latin
copies in Romans 4. 2. added this word ( Legis) of the Law, and thence they
infer that all works are not excluded from justifying a man. And in all the
Latin copies this word Luke 1. 28.
( full) in the Angels salutation to Mary is added, Aue gratia plena.
whence they likewise gather an argument to deify the Virgin Mary.

3 Perverted, and that two ways, First, by taking that literally which is
meant figuratively, as that phrase of Christ in the institution of his last
Supper, Mat. 26. 16.
This is my body, 2 By taking that allegorically, which was spoken properly, as
that speech of Peter to Christ, Luke 22. 38.
Here are two Swords, Bonifac. 8. in extra^.
whereby they would prove that there belongs to the Pope two Swords: the
spiritual Sword of a Pastor: and the temporal Sword of a King.

4 Misapplyed, by turning the places which they allege, to another thing then
was intended by the Holy Ghost. As in that speech of Christ to Peter Mat. 16.
18.
Upon this Rock, etc. Bellarm. de Romans ^ent. lib. 1 ca. 10.
they apply that to Peter, and to the Pope, which Christ meant of himself.
Herein do Separatists and Shismatiques much offend. These Texts Genesis 3. 15.
I will put enmity between thy seed and her seed: Isa. 52. 51.
Depart, depart ye, come out from thence, etc. Reu. 18. 4.
Go out from her my people, with the like, they allege to draw men from all
the assemblies of Gods Saints whither any wicked men do resort.

. 17. Of the sharpness of Gods Word.
Whereas he suggesteth that the Word is a blunt Sword, The Word a sharp
sword.
expressly he crosses Heb. 4 13.
the testimony of the holy Apostle, who says that it is a very sharp and ke^^e
Sword, sharper then any two edged sword, piercing eue^ to the dividing of the
soul and spirit, etc. That Heretics and other wicked men are no whit moved
thereby, it is because their hearts are hardened as Exodus 7. 13.
Pharaohs was, and their eyes blinded as Number. 22. 31.
Balaams: they are Ephe. 4. 19.
past feeling. If ever they come to have any life, and light, and sense, this
Sword will so pierce their souls, as it will utterly confound them, so as they
shall not have what to oppose. In the mean while so sharp is this Sword, that
I doubt not but it makes a wound even in the conscience of the hardest heart.
But what if at all it pierces not such obstinate persons? yet it defends us
from being hurt by their obstinacy, so as this Sword is not altogether without
use.

. 18. Answer to Satan's Suggestion of the difficulty of Gods Word.
3 Sugg. THis Sword is so fast in the scabberd, that it can hardly, if at all,
be pulled out. To speak plainly, it is so hard and difficult, that the true
meaning cannot be found out. Herein also are Papists besotted, who allege to
this purpose the words of Peter, that among those points which Saint Paul
delivered in his Epistles, 2 Pet. 3. 16.
some are hard to be understood.

Answ. If God deserve more credence then Satan, Gods word perspicuous
this Suggestion is directly false. God says that his Psa. 119, 105
Word is a light unto our feet, and a lantern unto our paths: and 19. 8.
that it gives light to the eyes: that it Pro. 1. 4.
gives to the simple sharpness of wit, and to the child knowledge and
discretion: that 2 Cor. 4. 3.
if it be hid, it is hid to them who are lost, in whom the god of this world
has blinded their minds. Scriptura omnibus accessibilis, pauciffinis
penetrabilis.
All these and such like Divine testimonies argue a perspicuity in the
Scripture, Aug. Epist. 3.
so as all may and ought to have free access unto it, but very few can diue
into the depth of it: for it cannot be denied but that in sundry respects the
Scriptures may be said to be hard.

. 19. Of the respects wherein the Scripture is difficult.
FIrst, in regard of the matter: Many profound and deep mysteries are contained
in them, which David calls Psalm. 119. 18.
wondrous things: thus 2 Pet. 3. 16.
many things in Paul's Epistles are hard: yet these profound mysteries are so
plainly and distinctly laid down in the Scripture, that they who are not
ouercurious, ( Romans 12. 3.
presuming to understand above that which is meet to understand, but will
understand according to sobriety) may conceive. For example, the Trinity of
persons in the unity of the Deity, the hypostaticall Union of the two natures
of Christ in one person, with the like, are inconceivable mysteries: yet so
plainly opened in the Scripture, as we may well discern these things (...).
to be so, though we cannot fully conceive (...).
how they should be so.

Secondly, 2 The manner of writing.
in regard of the manner of writing: many abstruse phrases are therein, as
diverse Hebraismes, which it may be were familiar to the Jews, but are obscure
to us, and sundry Metaphors, allegories, and other tropes and figures. Yet
these by diligent study of the Scriptures, and careful use of the means. 3.
beforenamed, may also be found out.

Thirdly, 3 The persons
in regard of the persons who read or hear the Scriptures. 1 Cor. 2. 14.
Natural men are not capable of the things of the Spirit of GOD, they cannot
know them: 2 Cor. 44.
and the God of this world does blind the eyes of wicked men: yet 1 Cor. ^2.
15.
He that is spiritual, discerns all things: for God gives unto him Ephe. 1.
17.
the Spirit of revelation, whereby the eyes of his understanding are opened.
Many despise the Scripture because of the plainnes of it: Quomodo eris
penetrator obscurorum, contemptor mani festorum? Aug. de Fast.
what marvel then that God hide from them the great and divine mysteries of his
Word? how should he conceive that which is hard, who despises that which is
easy?

Fourthly, 4 Manner of searching.
in regard of the manner of searching: for if men cursorily and carelessly read
the Scripture, no marvel if they understand little or nothing; for (...). 2.
4, 5.
the promise of finding is made to those who seek as for gold, and search as
for treasures.

. 20. Of the reasons why the Scripture is in some respects difficult.
IN these and such like respects the Scriptures are indeed hard, which the Lord
has so ordered for just and weighty reasons, as

First to declare unto man his natural blindness, and to suppress all
self-conceit. By the mysteries of the Word, the wisdom of man is found to be
foolishness.

Secondly, to keep holy things from Hogs, and Dogs, and so to make a
difference betwixt the children of the kingdom, and the wicked.

Thirdly, to maintain the divine ordinance of preaching, and expounding the
Scriptures.

Fourthly, to raise up in us an appetite after the Word, and an high esteem of
it, and to keep us from loathing it. Deep and profound matters are much
desired and respected easy things are soon loathed. Magnifice et salubriter
Spiritus it a Scripturas modificauit, vt locis apertiorihus fami o^ curreret,
obscurioribus fastidia detergeret. Aug. de Doct. Chr. lib. 2. ca. 6.
Wherefore the holy Spirit of God has so tempered the holy Scripture, as by
the perspicuity of it we are kept from staruing, and by the difficulty of it
from loathing it.

Fifthly, to stir us up diligently to study and search the Scriptures, and
carefully to use the means whereby we may find out the hidden Treasure in it.

Sixthly, to make us to call upon him who is the Author of the Scripture, to
give unto us the Spirit of revelation, and not to read or hear the Word
without faithful and earnest prayer.

. 21. Of the perspicuity of the Scripture.
But to return to the point. Though the word in the forenamed respects, and
for the forenamed reasons be difficult and obscure, yet is it for the most part
so perspicuous, as with great profit, and to good edification, Scriptura quasi
amicus familiaris sine fuco ad cor loquitur indoctorum atque doctorum. Aug.
Epist. 3
it may be read and heard of the simple and unlearned. And as for all the
fundamental points of Christian Religion, necessary to salvation, they are
clearly and plainly set down, so as the humble and obedient heart may
distinctly, without wavering and gainsaying, conceive and believe them. Greg.
Epist. ad Leand.
Thus not unfitly is the Scripture compared, in regard of the perspicuity of
it, to afoard, over which a Lamb may wade; and in regard of the difficulty of
it, to a Sea, in which an Elephant may swim.

. 22. Answer to Satan's suggestion of the danger of suffering all sorts to read
the Scriptures.
4 Sugg. IT is indeed a two-edged Sword: but too sharp and keen for children.
It is not fit that Laymen, Women, and such as have not skill in Tongues and
Arts, should read it: they often pierce and wound their own souls and
consciences with this Sword, as children hurt themselves with knives. With this
also are the Papists exceedingly beguiled.

Answ. As the Word is sharp in it self, so has Pro. 1. 4. The word sharpens
the wit of the simple.
it an inward power to give sharpnes of wit, and that unto the simple: and to
the child, knowledge and discretion, so as by the word they may learn well to
use the Word. How can that be thought to be unfit for laymen and women to use,
which God has expresiy commanded the^ to use, except question be made of his
wisdom? As the forenamed girdle, brestplate, shoes, shield, helmet, were
prescribed to all of all sorts, so this sword: and Christ, without exception of
any, says to all, John. 5. 39.
Search the Scriptures. God expressly commands, That the Law be read to all,
even men, women, children, strangers, Deuteronomy. 31. 11. 12. And great reason there
is for it: for as every one eats for himself, so he lives by his own
faith: but the Word is the ground of faith. By it therefore must they know what
they believe. Verbum est b^nus gladius, cuius gladij bon^^^ vulnus: vulnerat
dei verbum sed non v^cerat Ambr. de virg. lib. 3.
As for those wounds in conscience which many receive by the Word, they are
good wounds, whereby, such corruption as festred in them being let out, the
conscience is more soundly healed up; the wounds which it makes turn not to
festring sores.

. 23. Answer to Satan's suggestion of the hurt of much knowledge.
5. Suggest. TOo much knowledge is not good, it 1. Cor. ^. 1.
puffs up, it makes people contemn their brethren, neglect Ministers,
loathe preaching. But ignorance is mother of devotion. These things has Satan
taught, not only Papists, but also many other, which pretend an hatred of
Popery, to object against the Word.

Answ. Knowledge in it self is a very good thing, Knowledge of the Scripture
necessary.
a duty expressly commanded: 2. Pet. 1. 5.
Join with virtue, knowledge, says Saint Peter: yea Saint Paul goes further,
and implies that it is our duty to be Col. (...)
filled with knowledge, and to 2. Cor. 8. 7.
abound therein: and on the other side the Prophet complains, that Ost. ^^6.
Gods people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. It is not knowledge, but the
abuse thereof which puffs up, and 1. Cor. 8. 1.
so much does the Apostle imply. Now if the abuse of a good thing should make
us avoid it, what good thing should not be avoided? The cause that Ministers,
or any other are contemned, is not knowledge, but that corruption which is in
man; even as by the venom in a Spider, the sweet juice of a flower is turned
into poison.

But the truth is, Knowledge makes preaching to be had in esteem
that nothing makes the preaching of Gods word to be more highly accounted of,
then knowledge: for

1 They who know something of the great mysteries of godliness, if they know
it aright, find such good thereby, that earnestly they desire to know more.

2. They desire also to have their affections wrought upon, and that which they
know, to be often brought unto their minds: for which end also the preaching of
the Word is ordained. 2. Pet. 1. 13.
This moved S. Peter to write.

3. They who know that to be true which is preached, do in that respect the
better attend unto it, with greater assurance believe it, and more highly
esteem the Preachers of it: because they know it to be the truth of God. Thus
the Thessalonians received the Word preached 1 Thessalonians. 1. 5.
In much assurance, because and 2. 13.
they received it Not as the word of men, but of God. There can be no greater
enemy to preaching and Preachers then ignorance: instance the rude villages of
the Country.

. 24. Of Ignorance: how heinous a sin it is.
The devotion which is pretended to come from ignorance, is mere superstition,
or, which is worse, Idolatry. So much the Apostle affirms, Gal. 4. 8.
When ye knew not God, ye did sernice to them which by nature are not Gods.
Ignoratio Scripturarum, ignoratio Christi est. Hier. in pro^e^^ in Isa.
For ignorance of Gods word is the cause of all error, as Christ implies,
saying, You err, not knowing the Scriptures, ( Matthew. 21. 29.) Yea the
Scriptures being They which testify of Christ ( Ioh. 5. 39.) upon ignorance of
the Scriptures must needs follow ignorance of Christ. Now ignorance being in it
self a most odious vice, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8.
against which Christ will come in flaming fire to render vengeance: and a
mother sin, which brings forth many other notorious sins: how can any
good thing come from it? Certainly this cavil which is raised against
knowledge for ignorance, has sprung, either from Envy, whereby men grieve at
the knowledge and good parts which are in others; or from Ambition, whereby
they seek to be eminent above all other; or from Policy, seeking thereby a
cover for their own ignorance. Number. 11. 29.
Moses (who desired that all the Lords people were Prophets) and Act. 26. 29.
Paul (who wished that all that heard him were altogether as he himself was)
were otherwise minded.

. 25. Answer to Satan's suggestion of the non-proficiencie of many hearers.
5. Sug. MAny who read and hear much are not any whit the more freed from
assaults: the flesh, world, and Devil, bear as great a sway in them, as in
any other.

Answ. It is certain that many are most wrongfully blamed. A more in their
eyes who love the Word, is made a beam: Man's dulnes can be no blame to the
Word.
a molehill, a mountain. If indeed there be any such, as there are too many,
the fault is not in the Word, but in themselves. Though the Sun shine never
so hot, and often on a stone, it softneth it nothing at all. If it shine on clav,
it hardneth it. Stony hearts are no whit bettered; muddie, claiey, polluted
hearts are made worse.

THE THIRD TREATISE.
Of the means to use spiritual Armor aright.
THE FIRST PART.
Of Prayer in general.
Ephesians 6. 18. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the
Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
Saints. 19. And for me, that utterance may be given unto me; etc.
. 1. Of the joining of prayer with the whole Armor of God.
AFTER that the Apostle, How to get and use the Christian Armor.
like a good Captain, had sufficiently, furnished the Christian Soldier from
top to toe with all needful spiritual Armor, both defensive and offensive,
he proceeds to instruct him how he may get and well use this Armor. To all
other graces add Prayer.


The best general means that he could prescribe, is prayer: for that Armor
being spiritual and heavenly, we fleshly and earthly, Some take prayer to be
a distinct part and piece of Christian Armor: whereunto I agree not for two
reasons. First, The forenamed pieces are so complete (for by them a man is
armed from top to toe) that there is no part wanting. Secondly, No outward
piece of Armor is annexed to it, whereunto it should be resembled: therefore
I rather take prayer to be an especial means to help us well to weild and
use the forenamed Armor.
we are as unfit to use it, as a Child to use a Giants Armor.

In setting down this heavenly exercise of prayer, he so sets it down in
the last place after all, as it has a reference to all, and such a reference
as implies a joint use of it with all the rest: for he uses the participle
praying, (...)
as if he had said, put on the whole armor of God praying, take Girdle,
Breast Plate, Shoes, Shield, Helmet and Sword, praying

Hence I observe, Obser.
that To all other means which are used for defense or offense, Prayer must be
added. It must, I say, be added: neither they nor this omitted, but both joined
together. Excellently was this of old set forth by the Israelites manner of
going to battle. Oratione operatio, and operatione fulciaetur oration. Hier. in
Lam. cap. 3.
As the people were to go armed, and to fight, so Number. 10. 9.
the Priests were to go with silver Trumpets, and to sound: this sounding with
silver Trumpets employed hearty and earnest prayer. Note the benefit hereof. 2.
Chron. 13. 14, etc. Thus Exodus 17. 9. etc.
while Joshua and the people were fighting with the Amalakites, Moses stood
lifting up his hand, and Aaron and Hur stayed his hand: This was an outward
figure of their inward powerful prayer. When Moses let fall his hand, and he
left to pray, Amalek prevailed. So while 1. Sam. 7. 9, 10.
Israel fought against the Philistims, Samuel prayed: and while Psalm. 60. 1.
Ioab fought against Aram, David prayed. The like I might instance in 2. Chr.
14. 11
Asa, and 20. 6.
Iehosaphat, and 32. 20.
Hezekiah, and other Saints. If in fighting against flesh and blood, Saints
were thus careful in adding prayer to other means, how much more ought we so
to do in our spiritual combats against spirits? Mat. 26. 30.
Christ in his agony prayed: and 2. Cor. 12. 8.
Paul when he was buffetted of the messenger of Satan, prayed.

God who has appointed means of safety, Reason.
will not cross his own ordinance: without the use of them he will not
protect any. But of himself no man is able to use the Armor aright: it is God
which enableth him. Wherefore because God will do nothing without us, we must
arm our selves and fight, and because we can do nothing without God, we must
pray.

. 2. Of the mean betwixt presuming, and tempting God.
Number. 14. 2.
one while they would not venture to fight, and so tempted the Lord: and 4. 4.
another while they would needs fight of their own head, without seeking help
of the Lord, and so presumed obstinately. Rebellious are they who reject the
means: they clean cast themselves out of the protection of God. Presumptuous
are they who trust to the means, and call not upon God; they provoke God
either Ezech. 16. 15. 39.
to strip them of such things as they glory in, or else to turn them to their
own destruction, 1. Sam. 17. 8* 49.
as he did the strength of Goliath, 2. Sam. 17. 23.
and wisdom of Achitophel. The middle way betwixt the rock of rebellon, and
gul^e of presumption, is, so to show our obedience in using all the means
which the Lord prescribes, as we manifest our confidence in him, by seeking
strength of him. Mat. 19. 6.
Those things which God has joined together let no man put asunder. To all the
forenamed graces add prayer: pray for Armor, pray for strength, wisdom, and
ability well to use Armor, pray for a blessing on the well using it: be
upright and pray, righteous and pray, patient, faithful, sted fast in hope,
expert in Gods word, and pray: pray before the fight, fight and pray; without
prayer no good success can be expected: through prayer we may be assured to be
assisted.

. 3. Of dividing the Word aright.
IN laying down this doctrine of Prayer, the Apostle does so skilfully couch
together many several and distinct points, as every word almost affords a
several doctrine: he contenteth not himself in general to exhort unto the
duty of prayer, but also declares diverse circumstances appertaining
thereunto. Whence observe that

It is a warrantable course of teaching, Obs.
to set forth Principles of Religion in their several and particular branches.
This is one kind of 2. Tim. 2. 15.
dividing the Word aright.

Thus will the understanding of hearers be much informed with a distinct
knowledge of the mysteries of godliness, Reason.
and thus shall they much better discern the great depth of those mysteries,
and the rich treasure that is contained in them. Yea thus also shall their
memory be much helped in retaining them: for several branches distinctly and
in order set down, are a great means to strengthen memory.

Common-place-wise: by particular defining, dividing, subdiuiding, and distinct
handling of particular branches of the Principles of Religion.

Object. The Apostles use to comprise many distinct points compendiously in few
word: but many Preachers spend many words in laying forth one point.

Answ. They laid a foundation only, and therefore were the briefer: these make
up the building, and therefore may and ought to be the more copious. Yet this
gives no warrant to such as spend much time in mere discoursing, without any
distinction of order or matter: or to such as are over curious in multiplying
their divisions, or ouer-tedious in amplifying them. Neither does this tie all
Preachers, at all times to use one and the same method^diuers Romans 12. 6.
Preachers have diverse gifts: and diverse places of Scripture require a diverse
manner of handling: 1. Pet. 4. 10.
Let every man, as he has received the gift, minister the same.

. 4. Of the points to be handled in prayer.
IN these words of the Apostle concerning prayer, note,

1 His exhortation unto the duty it self.

2 His direction for the better performing of it. In his direction observe,

1 The kinds of prayer, all prayer and supplication.

2 The time thereof, always.

3 The ground of it, in the spirit.

4 An help thereunto, watchfulness.

5 The means of prevailing thereby, perseverance.

6 The person for whom.

1 In general, for all Saints.

2 In particular for himself, verse. 19. 20.

That he might the better urge this particular unto them, he declares.

1 What he would have them pray for in his behalf, verse 19.

2 Why he would have them pray for him, verse 20.

The first point to be handled, being the duty it self, I will therein
distinctly show. First what Prayer is. Secondly, why we ought to pray.

. 4. Of the definition of Prayer.
TRue Christian prayer is a right opening of the desire of the heart to God. 1.
Point. What prayer is.


Here note these three points. First that the hearts desire is to be opened.
Secondly, that it is to be opened to God. Thirdly, that it be rightly done.

The very form and essence of prayer consists in the opening and making
known of a man's inward desire, which the Scripture sets forth by a metaphor
of 1. Sam. 1. 15.
Pouring out the soul. Psalm. 62. 8.
Pouring out the heart: and 142. 2.
Pouring out a man's meditation, or complaint.

I call it a desire of the heart. First, because all desires arise from the
heart, that is, the fountain of them. Secondly, to distinguish true pray er
from every s^eight wish, and from lip labor.

These desires are made known by outward and inward means. The outward means
are Psalm. 5. 1.
words or and 123. 1.
signs. Words do most lively and plainly set forth the intent of the heart:
yet signs also, as lifting up the hands, casting down the eyes, stretching
abroad the arms, bowing the knees, ^ostrating the body and the like, do both
manifest a man's ^inward desire, and also stir up his affection. The inward
means are Romans 8. 26.
sighs and groans: by these God discerns ^mans desire, as well as by words
and signs. Psalm. 79. 11.
For 1 Samuel 16. 7.
God is (...) as man, 1 Chr. 28. 9.
he understands all the imaginations of the thoughts.

. 5. Of the object of Prayer, God only.
THus is the desire to be opened, and that to God: which David well knew, and
therefore says, Psalm. 38 9.
Lord, all my desire is before thee: Reasons.
yea to God alone: for Prayer is a principal part of divine service: But Mat.
4. 10.
God only shall thou serve. Often are we in holy Scripture called upon, to call
upon God, Ne quis audeat preces offerre nisi, soli domino Deo etc. Orig. contr.
Cel^. lib. 5.
but never by precept, promise, or any other way warranted to call on any
other. The true Saints, whose prayers have been approved, have ever prayed
unto God, never unto any other. And that upon just and weighty reasons.

First, Ier. 17. 10.
God only knows whether our desire come from the heart within, or from teeth
outward, and so can distinguish whether it be true prayer (even a pouring out
of the soul) or no.

Secondly, God only is Ier. 23. 23.
every where present, in all places, to hear the suites of all persons.

Thirdly, God only is Luke 1. 34.
Almighty, able to grant us what suit soever we shall make.

Object. One creature may be helpefull to another, why therefore may not prayer
be made of one to another?

Answ. Why no creature is to be prayed unto.
First, no creature can of it self be helpefull to any other, further then God
suffers and enableth it.

2. It is not a sufficient ground to move us to call upon a creature, because
it may be helpefull (for then many unreasonable creatures might be prayed
unto, which is a most unreasonable thing for any reasonable man to do) we must
know that he to whom we pray, hears us, and is both willing and able to
succor us. But this can we know of no invisible creature, whether Angel or
Saint departed: we neither know where they are, nor what they can do. In vain
therefore it is to call on them.

3. Difference betwixt divine and civil prayer.
Difference must be made betwixt civil and divine prayer. This is made with
assurance of faith, and persuasion of divine attributes in him to whom we make
it, together with religious adoration, which is Reu. 19. 10.
proper to the divine Majesty, and to be performed to no creature, neither and
22. 9.
Angel, Acts 10. 26.
nor man. And this is it whereof here we speak, and whereof all the question
is betwixt us and our adversaries.

Civil Prayer is that which is made only in civil respects; and that in such
particular things wherein we are persuaded they to whom it is made, can help
us: as to pray Ministers to teach and instruct us in the way to eternal life;
to pray Magistrates to relieve us against the wrongs of unjust men; to pray
Physicians in sickness to help us; and to pray others the like wherein they
are able. Yet so to seek help of these, as of Gods instruments, whom God has
provided to help, and in that respect to call upon God, and depend upon him for
his blessing on that help which man affords unto us. Thus we deny not but
that civil prayer may be made to men living and conuersing with us, to whom
we may make known our desire by outward means. But religious prayer is to be
made to God alone.

. 6. Of the reasons why our desire is to be made known to God.
Quest. What need is there that any prayer should be made to God at all? Psalm
44. 21.
God knows the secrets of our heart, and and 139. 2.
understands our thought a far off.

Aus. Why it is needful to make known our desire to God.
Prayer is made not simply to make known the desire and thoughts of our hearts
to God, so as otherwise God might be ignorant of them, but to testify man's
obedience to that order which God has set down. For it has pleased God in
his unsearchable wisdom, to appoint prayer a means to obtain all needful
blessings at his hands. Were there no other reason to show the equity hereof,
but Gods ordinance and commandment, it were sufficient: but this has God
appointed very wisely for many good reasons: as,

1. That it might appear we understand our own desires, and have a sense of
the thing we want.

2. That we may not only know, but acknowledge God the Author and fountain of
all blessings.

3. That we may manifest our faith in his gracious promises, and good guiding
providence.

4. That when we receive the good thing we have asked, we might ascribe the
praise thereof to God. For the making known of our wants to God, and craving
supply of them at his hands, is a means to make us acknowledge that, that
supply which we have is made by him, and that the praise thereof is due to him.

. 7. Of the things which are requisite to the right manner of prayer.
THe third thing in the definition of Prayer (in this word right) is not
lightly to be passed over: many points are comprised under it: they may all be
drawn to these two heads, 1 The Matter 2 The Manner of Prayer.

The Matter in general must be things lawful and good. How to pray aright.


The Manner respects, 1 The Persons both to whom the prayer is made, and also
who makes it. 2. The thing which is prayed for.

The Person to whom we pray being God (as we heard) two especial properties of
him must be regarded in prayer, 1. His Greatness. 2. His Goodness.

These two are implied in the Preface of the Lords Prayer. The word heaven,
where he is said to be, shows his greatness: the title Father, his
goodness. The Throne of God before which we appear in prayer, is a throne of
glory, and of grace: Gods glory and grace therefore must be duly weighed.

A due consideration of the former will move us,

1. To seek out a fit Mediator.

2. With all reverence to cast our selves before God.

. 8. Of praying in the mediation of Christ.
IF the greatness and glory of God be duly weighed, 1 Pray in the mediation
of Christ.
we shall find it to be so infinite, as no creature, much less weak sinful
man, can endure the brightness thereof. Esaias 6. 2.
It is noted of the Angels, that when they stand before the presence of God,
they cover their faces with their wings. If the glorious Angels cannot endure
the great and glorious Majesty of God, how should vile sinners, to whom God in
himself is Deuteronomy. 4. 24.
A consuming fire? Which being so, there is an absolute necessity of a fit
Mediator. This was prefigured under the Law by the High Priest, Exodus 28. 29.
who did bear the names of the children of Israel before the Lord. 1. Tim. 2.
5.
This Mediator is only one, Quid est dulcius quam genitorem in nomine
vnigeniti innocare? etc. quem. atium. dirigam tibi intercesserem nescio, nisi
bunc qui. est propitiatio pro peccatis nostris. Aug. med. c. 5.
even the man Jesus Christ. No other in heaven or earth was fit for that
office, but only he who was both God and Man, a true, proper, natural Son
of both, and so fit to bring man into Gods presence. Heb. 4. 14.
This, and this alone makes us with boldness appear before the Majesty of
God.

They who pray to God without a mediator, as Pagans, or in the name of any
other mediator but Christ, as Papists, pray not aright in this respect,
neither can they stand with comfort before God, when he shall manifest his
Majesty and jealousy.

But they who by the only begotten Son of God, are brought into the presence
of God, do further in regard of Gods excellency, carry themselves with all
reverence and due respect unto him.

This reverence must first be grounded in the heart, and then manifested by our
words and gesture in prayer.

. 9. Of inward reverence in prayer.
THat in our hearts we may fear God, 2 Pray in fear.
and think of him reverently, we must both before prayer meditate of his
glory and excellency (for so shall we come with hearts raised up from the
dunghill of this earth to the glorious Throne of heaven, as the Prophet says.
Lam. 3. 41.
Let us lift up our hearts, etc.) and also while we are in prayer, hold our
hearts close with God, that they be not carried away with vain thoughts, and
wandering imaginations: for our prayers are then but Esaias 29. 13.
lip-labor, nothing acceptable to God.

. 10. Of words befitting prayer.
Words whereby this inward reverence is to be manifested, 3 Pray with seemly
words.
must be sitting our matter, and neither ouer-curious, nor ouer-carelesse and
loose. Curiosity of style hinders denotion, and argues affectation: it
shows that men in praying seek their own praise, rather then Gods. A loose
style (to say the least) argues too light esteem, and too great neglect of
him to whom we make our prayer.

. 11. Of gesture in prayer.
Our gesture must be Psalm. 95, 3, 6.
reverend, 4 Prayer with reverend and humble gesture.
and Ezr. 9. 5. 6.
humble. Kneeling is the fittest gesture to express both these, and most
proper to prayer. Saint Ephe. 3. 14.
Paul sets forth the very act of prayer by this gesture, and Act. 20. 36.
uses it himself. If conveniently we cannot kneel, then stand. Mark. 11. 25.
This gesture Christ warranteth. Luke 18. 13.
The poor humble Publican stood when he prayed. To pray sitting, leaning,
lying, with hat on head, etc. when no necessity requires, argues little
reverence and humility.

. 12. Of faith in prayer.
THe other property of God to be especially regarded of us in prayer, 5 Pray in
assurance of faith
is his goodness, in respect whereof, we must Heb. 10. 22.
come in assurance of Faith to be heard and accepted. Iam. 1. 6.
For Mar. 11. 24.
Faith is that means whereby a blessing is James 5. 15.
obtained. and 1. 7.
Let not therefore the incredulous person think, that he shall receive any
thing of the Lord. For strengthening our faith in prayer, we must seriously
meditate of the promises concerning such things as we pray for, and of Gods
truth in performing them, as 2. Sam. 7. 27, 28.
David did.

. 12. Of lowliness of mind in him that prays.
FOr the person that prays, two things are requisite in regard of himself.

1 Lowliness of mind.

2 Holiness of life.

Lowliness of mind causes an utter denial of our selves, 6 Pray with
lowliness of mind.
when in truth we know and acknowledge that in us is no ground of confidence,
but altogether matter of despair. Of this mind was David (when he said Psalm.
143. 2.
Enter not into judgment with thy servant, etc.) Dan. 9. 8.
Daniel, and all the best of Gods children: for the better men are, the more
lowly they think of themselves.

For attaining to this grace, How the mind is made lowly.
we must impartially weigh our own balenesse, as Abraham, who said, Genesis 18.
27.
I am but dust and ashes: and our vileness through sin, as Job, who said, Job.
39 37.
I am vile; or rather Psalm. 51. 3. etc.
David, who laveth his sins in order before God. He that duly pondereth with
himself, how his sins for number are innumerable, and for weight infinite,
and how all his righteousness is as filthy rags, defiled with that sink of
corruption which is in him, cannot but utterly deny himself, and so be of a
lowly mind, not pu^t up with any conceit of himself.

. 13. Of holiness in him that prays.
Holiness of life is also very needful: 7 Be holy that pray.
for true is that which the blind-man said, Psalm. 66. 18.
God hears not sinners. John. 9. 31.
Esaias 1. 15.
Though ye make many prayers, I will not hear, says the Lord to the wicked.
Wherefore 1, Tim. 2: 8.
the Apostle exhorts to lift up pure hands, which Psalm. 26. 6.
David professes to do.

Think of this all impious and profane persons, unclean and cruel persons,
all impenitent sinners whatsoever. God will not have his holy name polluted in
your polluted mouths. James 5. 16.
But the prayer of a righteous man avails much.

. 13. Of praying with understanding.
COncerning the things prayed for, 8 Pray with sense of the things prayed for.
it is requisite that we have

1 A true understanding and sense of them:

2 A true and earnest desire of them.

Understanding and sense respects both good things and evil. If we pray for
good things, we must both know they are worth the having: and also sencibly
feel the want of them. Such are those Matthew. 5. 3.
poor is spirit, whom Christ pronounces blessed.

It we pray against evil, we must both know that they are in themselves heavy
burdens, and also feel that they lie upon us, as Psalm. 32. 4. and 38. 4.
David did: otherwise we shall never pray heartily for the one, or against the
other.

. 14. Of our desire in Prayer.
Our desire in Prayer must be both sincere and fervent, even an hungring,
thirsting, longing desire. 9 and 10.
Under these metaphors the desires of the faithful are often set forth. Pray in
sincerity of heart, and with feruency of spirit.
Now hungry and thirsty persons, and women that long, do both in truth, and
also with great earnestness desire that which they desire. If in Prayer our
desire be such, it will pierce the Heavens, and move God to yield unto it: if
it be not a true and sincere desire, but complementall and hypocritical, it is
no prayer of the heart, but mere lip labor, and so no whit acceptable to him
who searches the heart. If it be not fervent, but a cold desire, it cannot
pierce so high as Heaven. For as a bullet flies no further then the heat and
force of powder drives it: so Prayer no further then the fervor of spirit
carries it. Be therefore Romans 12. 11.
fervent in spirit. We heard that the Prayer of a righteous man auatleth much,
but with this Prouiso, Iam. 5. 16.
If it be fervent.

Thus in general we see what Prayer is: whereby we may be directed how to
pray. Now let us see what motives there be to stir us up thereunto.

. 15. Of the first motive to Prayer, Gods command.
I Might here urge Gods express charge and commandment thereunto, Motives to
Prayer 1 Gods charge.
which is often inculcated thorowout the Scripture: a motive sufficient though
there were no other. For Gods Precepts being wilfully contemned, or carelessly
neglected, procure no less penalty then eternal destruction of body and
soul. It should seem that this motive prevailed much with David (for so soon
as Psalm. 27. 8
the Lord said, Seek ye my face, his heart answered, O Lord, I will seek thy
face;) and much will it prevail with all such as desire to approve themselves
to God. But because it is a general motive unto all Christians whatsoever, I
will no longer insist upon it. Particular motives have respect either to God,
unto whom we pray, or unto our selves who pray.

. 16. Of the second motive to Prayer, Gods worship.
FOr God, 2 The most principal part of Gods worship.
First Prayer is a part, the most principal, especial and proper part of Gods
worship. David joins them together, saying, Let us worship and fall down,
etc. That is, by falling down, and calling upon God, let us worship him.

2 Among other parts of Gods worship, Kneeling.
the most reverend gesture is applied, and even appropriated to this.

3 The place of God worship was by an excellency termed, Esaias 56: 7.
The House of Prayer.

4 Prayer is made an essential note of difference betwixt such as worship God,
and such as worship him not. 2 Timothy 2. 19
They are said to call upon God: 1 Cor. 1. 2.
These, Acts 9. 14.
not to call upon God. Psalm. 14. 4.


. 17. Of the third motive, Gods honor.
2 IT is the best and chiefest means of honoring God that can be: 3 Nothing
whereby God is more honored.
by it we acknowledge God

1 To be every where present, and in every place to hear his children, and on
this ground every where we call on him.

2 To be the fountain of all blessing, and therefore when our selves or others
want any blessing temporal or spiritual, by prayer we ask it of God: yea,
when we receive any, we give the praise of it to God.

3 To be a God full of pity and compassion, which makes us to lay open our
griefs and distresses to him.

4 To be an Almighty God, able to give whatsoever we desire.

5 To be a bountiful God, who gives to all liberally, and vpbraideth not.

6 To be a God true of his promises, and therefore we crave the accomplishment
of them.

These and otherlike properties of God does faithful prayer set forth; and so
bring great honor to God, in which respect God himself says, Psalm. 50. 15.
Call upon me, and thou shall glorify me.

. 18. Of the fourth motive, the necessity of Prayer.
FOr our selves, four points there be which commend this holy exercise. 1 The
necessity. of prayer. 2 The utility. of prayer. 3 The efficacy. of prayer. 4
The dignity. of prayer.


1 If any good thing be necessary to a Christian, 4 Absolutely necessary.
prayer must needs be necessary, because it is that means which God has
appointed to obtain every good thing, Mat. 7. 7
Ask and it shall be given you, says the Lord, which gives all: Iam. 4. 3
Ye get nothing, because ye ask not, says his Apostle: we have no good thing
in our selves, or of our selves, all is hid in God: he is the fountain of all
blessing; but he is a deep well: we must have something to draw up water: the
only means is prayer. Is it not necessary that a poor man that has not of
his own a crumme of bread or drop of water, should make his want known to
such as can and will relieve him? How much more necessary is it that Christians
should make their wants known to God, seeing otherwise there is no hope of
receiving relief from him?

. 19. Of the things which men receive without calling upon God.
Object. MAny profane and wicked men who never call upon God, receive many
blessings from God. Mat. 5. 45.
He makes his Sun to arise on the evil, and sends rain on the unjust.

Ans. 1. The things which such receive are even as nothing, not to be spoken
of, because they tend not truly and properly to their good: all that they
receive are either temporal things, or only restraining graces, which tend
rather to the good of others, then of them which receive them.

2 Such persons were much better want all those things then have them: for
because they call not on God, God gives them no grace well to use them, so as
they abuse them to their own destruction: 2 Samuel 17. 23
Achitophels wit, 1 Samuel 17. 9
Goliahs strength, Acts 12. 23.
Herod's eloquence, were the cause of their overthrow in this World: and though
all have not like ends in this World, yet all heap up wrath unto themselves
against the day of wrath. Read Romans 2. 4. 5.

3 That spirit which comes accompanied with all needful saving and
sanctifying graces, is not gotten without Prayer. Luke 11. 13.
God gives the holy Ghost to them that desire him.

. 20. Of the fifth motive, the profit of Prayer.
2 THe vtility or profit of Prayer is much every manner of way. 5. Every way
profitable.
It is profitable,

1 To obtain every good thing, 1. To obtain good things.
as is evident by the promise of Christ ( Ioh. 16. 23.) Verily, verily, I say
unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
Note the certainty of this promise in Christ's vehement asseueration: Note the
generality of it, Whatsoever. Lege in Just. Martyris Apolog 2. Marci
imperatoris epistola ad S. R. de precth. Christianorum.
The Heathen among whom the Christians lived after the Apostles days,
observing so much, said; There was nothing which Christians could not obtain
of God by Prayer. I might here particularly exemplify this by several
instances of all kinds of blessings, spiritual and temporal, public and
private, for our selves and others, concerning this life and a better, and show
how Gods children have by Prayer obtained them: and also declare several
promises made by God for all these. But I have in part declared these Treatise
2: Part 6.. 72, 73, etc.
before, and I shall have fitter occasion to handle them, 2. To prevent or
remove evils.
when I speak of the matter of prayer.

2 Ier. 2^. 19.
To prevent judgments threatened, and Iam. 5. 18
remove judgments inflicted. Note for this purpose the prayer of Solomon. 1
Kings 8. 33, etc.

3 To preserve, 3 To preserve grace.
nourish, and strengthen in us all spiritual graces: Luke 22. 32.
by Christ's prayer was Peter's faith kept from failing: whereby Christ shows
that Prayer is an especial means to be used to that end. So Col. 1. 9, etc.
the Apostle prayed in the behalf of the Colossians, that they might be filled
with knowledge, etc: increasing therein, and strengthened, etc.

4 1 King. 8. 47
To obtain remission of sins: 4 To obtain pardon.
for this is the sum of the fifth Petition; and for this end Peter says to
Simon Magus, Acts 8. 22.
Pray God, that if it be possible the thought of thine heart may be forgiven
thee: whereby he implies that if remission of sins may be obtained by any
means, Prayer is that means.

5 To subdue in us the power of sin, 5 To subdue sin.
which David well knowing, prayed Psalm. 19. 13, and 119. 133.
that sin might not have dominion over him. I dare boldly avouch (and I dout
not but every Christian soul, that is acquainted with this holy exercise of
prayer, can by experience justify the truth of what I shall avouch) that the
more constant and powerful a man is in prayer, the less power sin has in
him; the more sin prevails, the weaker is the spirit of prayer: when Gods
children fall into temptation, and yield unto sin, their souls are entangled
thereby, as a bird whose feathers are besmeared with birdlime, or whose feet
are caught in a snare: they cannot fly up to heaven. If by prayer they keep
their hearts aloft, they are the more free from being entangled by Satan.
Faithful prayer, and purpose to sin, cannot stand together. In this respect I
may not unfitly compare the spirit of prayer, to that spirit and breath which
comes from the lungs of a man, whereby that ouer-great heat, which otherwise
would dry up all his radical and natural moisture, is cooled and allayed,
for it is prayer which cools and allayeth in man the immoderate heat of
lust, anger, malice, envy, etc.

6 To sanctify all Gods creatures unto our use: 6 To sanctify the things we
do, or use.
for as Gods word gives a warrant for the using of the creatures which are
needful, and a direction whereby we are taught how to use them; so prayer to
God obtains a right unto them, and a blessing upon them: therefore the
Apostle joins both these together, and says that the creature 1. Tim 4. 5.
is sanctified by the Word and prayer. For this end Mat. 14. 19. and 15. 36.
and 26. 26.
Christ usually prayed before he used the creature: and all, even they who have
abundance, must pray, Give us this day our daily bread, that they may have a
right unto, and a blessing upon the creatures which they use: the like may be
said of the callings wherein we are placed, of the actions which we do, and of
al things which we have or use, all are sanctified by prayer: who without
prayer do, or use any thing, are usurpers, and can look for no blessing.

To conclude, Prayer is profitable unto all things.

. 21. Of the respects wherein ones Prayer is not heard.
Object. AGainst all that is said of the profit of Prayer, some object, that
the Prayers of many are fruitless: they obtain not the things desired: yea,
that God swears he would not hear Ier. 15. 1.
Moses, Samuel, Ezekiel. 14. 1 Iam. 4. 3
Noah, Daniel, Job.

Answer. 1 Many pray amiss, and so receive not; wherefore that out Prayers may
be profitable, we must learn to pray aright, as we have been directed before.

2 Though God always grant not his servants request instantly, yet afterward
when there is a more seasonable time he does; for God is the Lord of times and
seasons, and best knows which is the fittest season, both for his own glory
and his childrens good to grant their request. For this end did not Christ at
first grant John 2 4. 7
his Mothers request, when she desired supply of wine; nor Mat. 15. 23, etc.
the request of the Cananite which she made for her daughter. Note his answer
to his Disciples: Acts 1. 7
It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put
in his own power.

3 Though he hear them not in that particular, yet in as good, or in a better
thing will he hear them. As 2 Cor. 12, 8, 9.
when Paul prayed against a temptation, God gave him grace sufficient to resist
it; and when Mat. 26. 39
Christ prayed to have his bitter cup removed, God enabled him to drink it;
whereupon it is said, that Heb. 5. 7
he was heard in that which he feared. 2 Samuel 12. 16
David prayed for his child that died, yet was not his prayer in vain; for
first his prayer was a sacrifice acceptable to God. Secondly, Verse 23.
God had mercy on the soul of his child. Thirdly, God gave him another son
of the same mother, a 24, 25.
Solomon, a Iedediah, a Prince of peace, beloved of the Lord, whom God made
King after David. God better knows what is good for us then we do our
selves: accordingly, though he hear us not always to our own will, and grant
what we suppose to be good, yet always he hears us to his own will, and
grants what he knows to be good for us.

4 The Saints well know what God has absolutely promised (as all needful
saving graces, and salvation it self, those absolutely they pray for and
obtain:) and what conditionally, as all temporal things, and such like as may
make sometime to their advantage, and sometime to their damage. These they pray
for with a subjection of their own wills to Gods, as Mat. 26. 39.
Christ unto his Father, Not as I will, but as thou will; and the Leaper to
Christ, Mar. 1. 40.
If thou will thou can make me clean; and David to God, 2 Samuel 15. 26
Behold, here I am, let him do to me as seems good in his eyes.

That which was objected of Moses, Samuel, Noah, Daniel, Job, is but a mere
supposition, not a thing done: besides, it is said; Ezekiel. 14. 14
They should deliver their own souls, so as their Prayers should not be
without profit.

. 22. Of the sixth motive, the efficacy of Prayer.
3 SVch is the efficacy of Prayer; 6. Very powerful.
as nothing can be more powerful: Magna sunt arma o^atio: ipsa bella deuicit,
etc. Chrysostom. in Hebr. hom. 27.
for it prevails over all creatures, whether reasonable, or unreasonable: and
of reasonable, both visible as man, and invisible as Angels, whether evil or
good: yea, it prevails with the Creator himself.

1 Dan. 6. 22.
Daniel by Prayer stopped the mouths of Lions among whom he was cast.

2 By 2 Samuel 15. 31. and 17. 23.
David's Prayer was Achitophels wisdom turned into foolishness. By Genesis 32.
11. and 33. 4.
Iaakobs Prayer was Esaus wrath allaied. By Est. 4. 16. and 10.
Mordichaies and Esthers Prayer was Hamans malice like Saul's sword, turned into
his own bowels. By 2 Kin. 19. 15, 35.
Hezekiahs Prayer was the whole host of Senacherib ouerthrown. One faithful
ma^s prayer is more forcible the^ the power of a whole army: Exodus 17. 11
witness the example of Moses, who lift up his hand while Israel fought against
Amalek.

3 Mat. 17. 21.
By Prayer the Devil when he has gotten fastest hold, and surest possession,
is cast out. It is here in this Text laid down as a means to subdue the
forenamed principalities and powers.

4 Mat. 26. 35.
If Christ would have prayed, he might have had more then twelve legions of
good Angels to guard him. 2 King. 6. 17.
At Elishahs Prayer a mountain was full of horses, and chariots of fire round
about it.

Object. If Prayer be thus powerful with Angls, it is good to pray unto them.

Answ. Dan. 7. 10.
The Angels are pressed only to Gods service, and always behold his face: when
he sends they go, and not when we call them: Now our Prayer moves God to send
them: and thus at our Prayer they come to guide us. Unreasonable creatures by
Prayer are restrained from hurting us, and made serviceable: is it therefore
reason that we should pray unto them?

5 Ose. 12. 4.
By Prayer Iaakob had power over the Angel, (which was the Angel of the
covenant Christ Jesus, true God,) who therefore was called Genesis 32. 28.
Israel, because he prevailed with God. Prayer so far prevails with God, that
ver. 26.
it even forces a blessing from him, (whereupon we are said Romans 15. 30 (...)
^o strive or wrestle in Prayer to God, and * stays, and holds him back
when he is going out in wrath, and 2 Kin. 20. 3. 4.
causes him to repent and reuerse his sentence pronounced.

. 23. In what respects men are said to prevail with God by Prayer.
Object. THis may seem to impeach the immutability, and omnipotency of God. If
man prevail with him, how is he almighty? if he repent, how is he unchangeable?

Answ. Those phrases of prevailing with God, of holding him, of his repenting,
and the like, are spoken figuratively, (...)
after the manner of men, for our better understanding. Voluntarily God
yields to all that he seems to be forced unto: yea he has beforehand
determined so to do; but as he appoints the thing to be done, so the means
whereby it is done: without the means nothing shall be done, upon a right use
of the means all things shall be effected: now prayer being the means
appointed by God of procuring blessing, and avoiding judgment, Prayer may
fitly be said (in regard of that order which God has voluntarily set down) to
be of power with God.

. 24. Of extraordinary effects of Prayer.
MAny admirable, and extraordinary are the things which the Prayers of Gods
faithful children have in all ages effected. Exo. 14. 15, 16.
At Moses Prayer the red Sea was divided asunder. Iof. 10. 12.
At Iosuahs Prayer the Sun stayed his course. Isa. 38. 2, 8.
At Hezekiahs Prayer it turned backward. At Iam. 5. 17.
Eliahs Prayer rain was stayed three years and an half together, infinite it
were to reckon up all particulars. I will bring to your remembrance only one
which among and above the rest is most remarkable, which is concerning Luke 3.
21, 22
Christ's Prayer at his baptism, by the power whereof first the heavens were
cloven. Secondly, the holy Ghost descended down upon him. Thirdly, the Father
gave an evident and audible testimony that Christ was his beloved Son:
whereby is declared that the Prayers of Gods children pierce the heavens, make
the holy Ghost to come into them, and cause God to witness that they are his
children, though not so visibly and audibly, yet as truly and effectually.

. 25. Of the use which we may make of efficacy of extraordinary Prayers.
Object. THese are extraordinary examples of extraordinary persons, who had an
extraordinary spirit: so as ordinary persons can look for no such matters: As
for Christ, he was the true natural Son of God.

Answ. 1 These things are recorded to show the power and efficacy of Prayer.
Iam. 5. 17.
To which purpose Saint James alleges that extraordinary example of the
Prayer of Eliah. And the argument will well follow from the greater to the
less. For if God heard his servants in extraordinary matters, will he not much
more hear us in such ordinary matters as we stand in need of, and he has
promised to give us?

2 Though Christ were the only begotten Son of God, and the proper object of
his love, yet in, and through Christ, God has adopted us to be his children:
and with that love he bears unto Christ, he loves us: so as if we call upon
him in Christ's name, Reu. 8. 3, 4.
he will hearken unto to us as unto his children, and accept of our Prayers, as
if Christ had made them: for he offers them up unto his Father.

Thus we see that Iam. 5. 16.
the prayer of a righteous man avails much.

. 26. Of the seventh motive, the honor of Praying.
4 THere is no one thing wherein and whereby God does more honor his servants,
7 A matter of great dignity
then by vouchsafing unto them this high privilege and savor to pray unto
him. By prayer have the Saints a free access unto the glorious throne of Gods
grace: yea they have a familiar acquaintance with him. It is a great
prerogative, that God in his Word vouchsafes to speak to man; but not
comparable to this, that man should talk with God. God by his Word speaks to
all, even to the wicked and rebellious, but none but Saints by Prayer speak to
him: (the Prayer of the wicked is no Prayer, but mere lip-labor.) We know
that it implies much more familiarity for an inferior freely to speak to his
superior, Esther 5. 2.
then a superior to his inferior. Esther though a Queen, accounted it a great
favor, that she was lovingly and kindly accepted, when she approached into the
presence of a mortal Monarch. Now consider how infinitely far greater the
divine Majesty is, then any humane can be, and this will show how high a
dignity it is to have a free access unto his glorious presence; especially if
withal we consider how full of grace and goodness he is to all that come
before him. The glorious Angels do admire the Saints, in regard of this honor
vouchfafed unto them.

. 27. A Collection of the motives to Prayer.
THus we see what strong motives here be to urge this duty. If either Gods
honor, or our own honor; if to please God, or to supply our own needs, and
necessities; if our own profit and benefit be any motives hereunto, motives are
not wanting. What exercise on earth so heavenly? and yet what, whereunto we are
more dull? O that so rare and excellent a duty, should so rarely and slightly
be performed, as commonly it is! Does not this argue as the great corruption of
our nature, so the subtle malice of the devil? For well he knows the vantage
that man gains, and damage which comes to him by Prayer. Let us be grieved
and humbled for our dullness and carelessness herein. Let us rowse up our
spirits and pray, that we may pray.

THE SECOND PART. The kinds of Prayer.
With all Prayer and supplication.
. 28. Of the general heads, whereunto the particular kinds of Prayer are
referred.
HItherto of the duty it self whereunto we are exhorted: II. Point. The kinds
of Prayer.
we are now to handle the particular circumstances, or branches of the Apostles
direction.

The first is concerning the kinds of Prayer, which are first intimated under
that general particle All, and then exemplified by two particular instances, 1
Prayer, 2 Supplication.

That we may distinctly handle the several kinds of prayer, which are here in
this Text comprised under this word All, and in other places of Scripture more
expressly set down; I will draw them into some order.

Prayer may first be distinguished according to the matter, and manner thereof.

In regard of the matter, the 1 Timothy 2. 1.
Apostle makes four several heads.

1 Supplications, (...)
or deprecations which are for the remouall of evil.

2 Prayers, (...)
which are for the obtaining of good.

3 Intercessions, (...)
which are in the behalf of others.

4 Thanks-giuings, (...)
which are for benefits received.

These four he refers Phil. 4. 6. (...)
in another place to two heads, 1 Requests. 2 Thanksgiving.


Under Requests he comprehends supplication and Prayer, under which also may
be comprised intercession.

Again, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17. 18.
in another place he mentions only two heads.

1 Prayer. 2 Thanksgiving.
By Prayer, he means petition. For when this word Prayer is set alone, it
compriseth all the kinds under it: when it is joined with thanksgiving alone,
it compriseth all kinds belonging to request. When it is joined with
deprecation or intercession, it is restrained to a desire of good things for
our selves.

The most general and usual distinction is grounded on 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17, 18.
which is

Petition.

Thanksgiving.

Petition may be distributed according to the things or persons in respect
whereof it is made.

The things which it respects are either good, to obtain them, which is most
properly Prayer; or evil, to remove them, which is Supplication; so called in
English, because when we are oppressed with any evil, it makes us cast down
our selves as poor suppliants, craving help and redress.

The persons are our selves or others. The forenamed kinds respect our selves.
That which respects others, is intercession: and that is either for them, or
against them.

According to this distribution we shall handle under Prayer, put for Petition,

1 Petition for good things.

2 Deprecation to remove evil things.

3 Intercession for others.

4 Expostulation against others:

. 29. Of the things to be asked in Prayer.
1. FOr Petition, 1 Kind. Petition for good things.
I need not stand to prove the general, that it is lawful to crave good
things: for this of all others is the most principal kind of Prayer. And this
general title Prayer, is most commonly attributed to it. I will rather more
particularly show,

1 What things we are to crave.

2 After what manner we are to crave them.

The things which may be asked, must be lawful and good: for so much implies
Christ where he says, that Mat. 7. 11.
God will give good things to them that ask him. Now those things are lawful
and good which are agreeable to the good will of God: for Gods will is not
only the rule and square of goodness, but the very ground of goodness. A
thing is not first good, and then willed of God; but therefore good, because it
is willed of God: so as Gods will gives the very essence and being unto
goodness. Whereupon Heb. 13. 21.
the Apostle having prayed for the Hebrews, that God would make them perfect
in all good wokes, adds by way of explanation, to do his will. This general
point of framing our petitions according to Gods will, Saint John expressly
lays down, saying 1 John 5. 14.
If we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us. Would we then know
what are those good and lawful things which may be asked? Search the
Scriptures, for in them is Gods will revealed. If we have our warrant from
thence for the good things we ask, then may we boldly ask, and look to
receive them.

. 30. Of the Sum of the Lords Prayer.
But because this is a large field, What good things are to be asked in prayer.
and a wide Sea, Christ has made an epitome, a brief collection of all such
things as are good and lawful to be asked, and comprised them in those few
petitions of the Lords Prayer. Where we may observe two several heads of them.

1 Gods glory, in the three first petitions, wherein praying to God, we say,
Thy Name, Thy Kingdom, Thy will.

2 Our own good, in the three last: wherein speaking of our selves, we say,
Our bread, Our trespasses, Lead us not, But deliver us.

Gods glory, is first of all, and most of all to be desired^ 1 Cor. 10. 31.
nothing is to be craned but that which may make there^unto. If Gods glory and
our salvation could come in^ opposition, that were to be preferred to this, as
Exodus 32. 32.
Moses shows by his own example. Therefore 1 Petition.
that has the first place in the Lords Prayer. As we are to desire it so to
desire 2 Petition.
the means whereby it may be effected, and 3 Petition.
the manifestation of it.

In regard of our own good, we may ask all needful^ things, whether they be 4
Petition.
temporal, concerning these frail^ bodies of ours while here we live: or
spiritual, and that either respecting our 5. Petition.
Justification, the principal part whereof is a discharge of that debt wherein
through sin we are bound unto God: or our 6. Petition.
Sanctification, in keeping us from the pollution of sin, and preserving us
safe from all evil unto salvation. The Scripture affords particular
instances of all these things asked of God by the prayers of the Saints. But
this warrant of the Lords Prayer being so sufficient, I need no longer to
insist upon it.

. 31. Of the diverse manner of asking things absolutely, and conditionally
promised.
Having seen what we must ask, let us see how we must ask.

We have heard before of many graces needful for a right manner of prayer,
which I will not here repeat, but only show how all things must be asked with
subjection of our will unto Gods will. Concerning absolute, and not absolute
promises, See Treat. 2 Par. 6.. 75. 76.
For this end respect must be had to Gods promises. For every acceptable prayer
is made in faith: Faith has an eye to Gods promises, and rests thereon: as
God has promised any thing, so the faithful ask it in Prayer. Things
absolutely promised, they crave absolutely, as Exodus 32. 10 11.
Moses, who would not let God alone, till he had spared his people, but Verse
32.
desired to be raced out of Gods Book, rather then his people should be
destroyed: and why? because God had made an absolute promise to bring them into
Canaan, Verse 13.
which promise Moses pleads unto God in his prayer.

Things not absolutely promised they pray for with subjection unto Gods will
and wisdom. For there are many things which are good in their kind, yet so
far make more or less to Gods glory and man's good, as it pleases God by his
wise providence to dispose them. For example, God has made an absolute promise
of the perpetual continuance of the Church, but not of a continual outward
flourishing estate thereof; for he can turn the persecution of his Church to
the increase thereof, Sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesiae.
and so gain honor to himself, and bring good unto his people thereby. Thus
for the time of accomplishing Gods promises, sometimes a long date, sometimes a
short date, may most make to his glory: and for the means, sometimes one kind
of means, sometimes another, with other like circumstances.

In all these, we must in our Prayers either express, or reserve in our minds
some secret limitations; as these, If God see it to be good; if his good
pleasure be such; if it may stand with his glory, etc.

. 32. Of the evils to be prayed against.
II FOr Deprecation, II. Kind. Deprecation against evil things.
or supplication, we have express warrant in the fifth and sixth Petitions of
the Lords Prayer: and also in the example of Christ ( Heb: 5. 7.
Wh^ offered up supplications with strong crying and tears, and was also heard
in that which he feared;) of Solomon ( 1 King. 8. 33, etc.
who expresses many particular branches hereof in the Prayer which he made at
the dedication of the Temple) and of other Saints in all ages: yea likewise 2
Chr. 7. 13, etc.
in the answer which God gave to Salomons prayer, and Psalm. 50. 15 What evils
are to be prayed against, Malum culpae, malum poen^.
in the many promises which God has made to deliver us from evil.

Here also we are to consider the matter and manner, What we are to pray
against, and how. Evil to be prayed against, is either of fault, or of
punishment.

. 33. Of praying against sin.
Evil of fault is sin. 1 Sin.
This is the first evil that ever was in the World: the greatest of all evils
(a greater evil then the torment of hell) and the cause of all evil of
punishment (for Iam. 1. 15
sin when it is finished brings forth death.)

In regard of this evil, three things are to be prayed against, 1. The guilt
of sin, 2. The power of it, 3. Temptations thereunto.

Against the first we pray in the fifth Petition: against the second and third
in the sixth Petition. In regard of the first David thus prays, Psalm. 51. 2.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. In regard
of the second, thus; and 19. 12.
Let not presumptuous sins have dominion over me. In regard of the third,
Christ says to his Disciples; Mat 26. 41.
Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.

The guilt of sin makes us odious and abominable in Gods sight, whose favor
causes our happiness. The power of sin makes us more and more to provoke
his wrath, which is unsupportable.

Temptations unto sin simply in themselves work neither of those two
mischiefs. For Christ (who was always most amiable in Gods sight, Col. 1. 13
(...)
the Son of Gods love, Isa. 42. 1
in whom his soul delighted, and who never pro^oked Gods wrath; Mat. 3. 17
for God was always well pleased in him) was often tempted to sin, as and 4.
3, etc.
by Satan himself in the Wilderness, by Scribes, Pharisees, and other such
enemies, yea, by Mat. 16. 22.
Peter when he told him of his suffering: but all his temptations could never
make him sin. As a firebrand thrust into the Sea is presently quenched, so
were all temptations cast against Christ. Yet notwithstanding temptations to us
are very dangerous, because of our pronenesse and readiness to yield unto
them. We are by nature to temptations, as tinder; or rather as gunpowder is to
fire. As the least spark of fire does not only soon kindle, but also
suddenly in flame gunpowder, and sets it all on fire: so every little
temptation soon fastneth on us, and inflameth us suddenly with the fire of
sin. Instance 2 Samuel: 11. 2.
David, who at the sight of Bathsheba was inflamed with lust; and Ma. 26. 69.
Peter, who at the word of a silly maid was soon brought to deny and
forswear his master. If these in whom Gods renewing Spirit abode, were by
reason of the flesh so prone to be overtaken by temptations, how can such stand
against them, in whom the flesh reigns, and where is nothing to restrain
them?

. 34. Of the manner of praying against the guilt and power of sin, and
temptations thereto.
AGainst the guilt and power of sin, we must simply, absolutely, instantly
pray, and never cease till God hear us.

That we may with the greater indignation pray against them, How to pray with
indignation against sin.
we must first narrowly and thoroughly examine our selves, and search what sins
we have committed; and amongst our many sins, observe which are the most
odious, which the most dangerous, what sins we are most addicted unto, and
what bear greatest sway in us. Thus when we see what grievous sins we are
slaves unto, we shall with great vehemence, as Ps. 51. 1, etc.
David, and with tears as Mat. 26. 75.
Peter, pray against them. The reason why most so sildome, so coldly and
faintly pray against their sins, is because they never examine themselves:
they see not how vile and wretched they are, by reason of them.

Against temptations we are to pray especially, that we be not given over unto
them, and overcome by them: but that the Lord would either deliver us from the
temptation, or so assist us therein, that it turn not to our destruction, but
rather to our good.

. 35. Of praying against punishments of sin.
Evil of punishment is threefolde,

1. Temporal.

2. Spiritual.

3. Eternal.

Temporal punishments are all outward judgments, 2 Outward Judgments.
miseries and plagues in this World: these are in themselves effects of sin:
from sin they came first: had man never transgressed, none of these had ever
been inflicted upon him. Genesis 2. 17
In the day thou eatest of the tree forbidden, thou shall die the death, says
God to man: All temporal judgments are fore runners of death, and
appurtenances thereof, and so comprised under it.

These may be sanctified, and made medicinable: and so they are, in and through
Christ's suffering, to Gods children: all outward afflictions are Gods physic
to the faithful. Absolutely therefore they are not to be prayed against, but
we are to pray either to have them removed, or else sanctified unto us.

Spiritual punishments, 3 Spiritual punishments of sin.
are slavery under Satan, the World, and the flesh, a seared and a dead
conscience, hardness of heart, blindness of mind, carnal security,
impenitency, infidelity, and such like. These are fearful evils, and to be
prayed against, as hell it self.

The Eternal punishment of sin, Eternal (...)
is such as cannot be expressed: it is set forth by the most intolerable
torments that be, as the gnawing of a Mat. 9. 44.
worm that never dies, Reu. 20. 14
A lake of fire; and 14. 10
yea, fire and brimstone, etc.

This evil causes an irrecouerable and perpetual separation from God: Reu.
16. 9.
and makes men to blaspheme the God of Heaven for their pains: in which
respect it is absolutely to be prayed against: for as sin makes men most
wretched, so this punishment of sin makes men most accursed.

. 36. Of praying for others, For all Saints,]
REspect must be had to others in our Prayers, III. Kind. Intercession for
others.
as well as to our selves: for in the Lords Prayer such Petitions as respect
the good of man, are set down in the plural number, Give us, Forgive us,
Deliver us. Expressly Iam. 5. 16.
the Apostle commands to Pray one for another.

This is to be done in regard of 1. God, Reasons.
to whom prayer is made. 2. Our selves, who make it. 3. Those for whom it is
made.


1 In that we call upon God for others as well as for our selves, 1. It
amplifieth Gods glory.
we acknowledge him to be not only our own Father, but also the common Father
of others; in which respect Christ has taught us to say, Our Father: yea, thus
we acknowledge God to be that only fountain from whence both our selves and
others also receive all needful blessings. So as this makes much to the
honor of God.

2 Hereby we perform a duty of love, 2 It is a duty of love.
one of the most principal duties that be. This Christ plainly shows, where
he makes it a branch of love: for having said, Mat. 5. 44
Love your enemies, he adds, Pray for them. Now Romans 13. 8.
love is a due debt which we owe to our brother: by performing this great duty
of love, we pay a great part of our debt. Thus we see that it is a matter both
of charity and of justice: they which neglect it, 1 Samuel 12. 2.
sin.

3 There is no one thing wherein and whereby we can be more beneficial, 3 It
is very profitable.
and do more good to any, then in and by Prayer. We. 20.
heard that Prayer is profitable unto all things, it extends to the good both
of body and soul, of the temporal and eternal estate of others as well as of
our selves.

. 37. Of those who pray not for others.
Use 1. MOst worthy of much blame are they who are never moved to pray, Such
reproved as 1 Take no notice of others necessities.
but in their own needs and distresses: of these,

1 Some will take no notice of others necessities. The Church of the Jews in
her captivity complained of such, saying; Iam. 1. 12
Have ye no regard all ye that pass by this way? If themselves be well in
their own conceits, they think all other should be well.

2 Some though they take notice, 2 Are not moved therewith.
yet are no whit moved to any compassion: as Lu. 10. 31, 32
the Priest and Leuite which came and looked on the man that lay wounded and
half dead in the high way, but having no compassion, passed by on the other
side. Such were those of whom the Prophet complained, saying; Amos 6. 6.
No man is sorry for the affliction of Joseph.

3 Some though they be moved, 3 Think this a needless ^uty.
yet perform not this duty, because they think it to be an idle frivolous
thing, nothing available or profitable: such were they whom Job brings in
thus speaking, Job 21. 15.
What profit should we have, if we should pray unto the Almighty?

The first sort of these bewray too much selfeloue.

The second sort discover too great sencelesnesse, and plain in humanity.

The third manifest too much distrust in God, and plain atheism.

All of them as they violate that excellent Christian duty of love, 1 Cor. 13.
5.
which seeks not her own things only, but desires and seeks the good of
others also: so they straiten and impair the rich treasure, and large ocean of
Gods goodness and mercy, which extends it self to all of all sorts.

Use 2. For our parts, All provoked to afford others the help of their prayers.
if faith in God and love to our brethren abound in us, they will make us
diligent in observing the needs of others, they will work in us a
fellow-feeling, and move even the bowels of compassion in us, and so provoke us
to commend our brethrens distresses to him whom we know to be able to succor
them. What made Mat. 2. 3, 4
the friends of the palsy man so diligent in bringing him to Christ? or what
made Mat. 15. 22.
the woman of Canaan, and Mar. 9. 22, 24.
the father of the lunaticke child, such importunate suitors to Christ for
their children? was it not their faith in Christ, and their love to those
parties? where this duty is neglected, there is want both of faith and of love.

. 38. Of the Persons for whom we must pray.
THus we have heard that Prayer is to be made for others: We will further show
more distinctly. First, who those other be which are to be prayed for.
Secondly, in what order others are to be prayed for. Thirdly, what things are
to be asked for in prayer for others.

The first point I will first handle negatiuely, and declare who are not to be
prayed for. And then affirmatively, and declare who are to be prayed for.

In general they are not to be prayed for, For whom prayer is not to be made.
whom we know our prayers cannot help. These are

1 All such as are dead.

2 They which sin against the Holy Ghost.

3 They concerning whom God has given an express charge to the contrary.

. 39. Of praying for the dead.
1 Not for the dead.
note what David says, 2 Samuel 12. 23
Why should I now fast? that which was said to ^airus, who sought help of
Christ for his child, Mar. 5. 35.
( Thy daughter is dead, why diseasest thou the master any further,) had been
to purpose, if Christ had not extraordinarily and miraculously raised her from
the dead. But such miracles cannot now be expected; therefore the dead are to
be let alone: for throughout the whole Scripture there is not one title which
sauoreth of any such matter, but rather against it. We read in the Law of many
sacrifices appointed for all sorts of people in all kind of distresses, but of
none for the dead? So also of many prayers prescribed 1 These. 4. 13
where of

Though these be negative arguments, yet are they not lightly to be rejected:
for they plainly show that prayer for the dead, is a newfound doctrine, an
article invented since the Prophets and Apostles times, without warrant of the
Word now the spirit warns that 1 Timothy 1. 3. (...).
none teach other doctrine, auouching that if any do, and 6. 4.
he is proud and mad, and therefore bids Romans 16. 17.
avoid such, yea Gal. 1. 8. (...).
he denounces a fearful curse against them which preach Heb. 11. 6.
otherwise then the Apostles had done. Besides, this being without warrant of
the Word, Qualis exieris de hac vita, talis redderis illi vita. Aug. in Psalm.
36.
how can it be performed in faith? i if not in faith, how can it be acceptable
to God? To say the least against Prayers for the dead, they must needs be vain
and fruitless: for Gods determinate judgment passes on every one so soon as
they die: Reu. 14. 13.
If they die in the Lord, blessed are they: if they die in their sins, they
are irrecouerably cursed, as is employed in the parable of Dives being in hell,
Quousque nobis tempus conceditur recte viuamus, etc. medici post qua^ aegrotus
obijt ne quicquam prodesse potest. Chrysostom. hom. 75. in Mat.
to whom Abraham being in heaven, thus says, Luke 16. 26.
They which would go from hence to you, cannot; neither can they come from
thence to us. Herein is the proverb verified, Where the tree falls, there it
lies: for as life leaves us, so judgment finds us. Prayer therefore for
the souls of the deceased, is as physic for the bodies of the dead.

. 40. Of Purgatory.
AS for Purgatory (which Papists make to be a middle place between heaven and
hell, Primum locum fides Catholicorum diuina authoritate regnum credit esse
caelorum: secundum gehenna^: tertium penitus ignoramus. immo nec esse
inscripturis sanctis in veniemus Aug. contra. Pelag. hypog. lib 5.
where they say all such are as die not in mortal, but in venial sin, and
from whence by the Prayers of the living they may be released,) it is a mere
fixion invented of man's idle brain, and maintained to increase Antichrists
earthly treasures: it is against the current of the Scripture, which
acknowledges but two sorts of people, Mat. 13. 38.
Children of the kingdom, and children of the wicked, faithful and
unfaithful; and accordingly only two places after this life, Luke 16. 23.
Mar. 16. 16.
heaven and hell. The distinction likewise of mortal and venial sin, as
they use it, making some sins in their own nature, by reason of the
smalnesse of them Venial, is against the Word, which says indefinitiuely of
sin (excepting no sin at all,) Romans 6. 23.
The wages of sin is death. Woe to them that after this life enter into any
fire: the Scripture no where mentions any temporary fire after this life, but
Mat. 18. 8.
everlasting and and 3. 12.
unquenchable.

Object. 1 The second petition compriseth the dead under it.

Answ. That petition has not any particular respect to any particular person
departed, so as it cannot justify any particular Prayers for a particular
person deceased, which is the question in controversy. Indeed that petition
respects the whole body of Christ, some of the members whereof are the Saints
now dead: but it follows not thereupon that it is a Prayer for the dead: for
principally it respects the living, and the dead only by consequence.
Besides, it implies no altering of the estate of the souls of the dead, which
is another point in question.

Object. 2. Many prayed for their children and friends which were dead, and had
them restored to life.

Answ. 1 This is nothing to the alteration of the estate of the souls, which
is the point in controversy.

2 Those were extraordinary examples done by extraordinary spirits, and are no
more exemplary then the Israelites passing through the red Sea, or Moses,
Eliahs, and Christ's fasting forty days.

Pray for the soul of A. B. and if any have been bountiful to their Church,
they use to offer up Masses, Dirige and requiem are the first words of certain
prayers for the dead.
and to say dirige, and to sing requiem for their souls from time to time. All
which (to say the least) are toyish and childish.

. 41. Of vain wishes for the dead.
NOt much unlike is the practice of many ignorant and superstitious persons
among us, who, if mention be made of any of their friends departed, use
presently to say, God be with him, the Lord be with his soul, or God have
mercy on his soul, with the like. Mark the persons that most commonly use
these vain wishes, and you shall observe them to be such ignorant and
irreligious persons as never pray for their friends while they are alive: for
if they knew how to pray aright for their friends, they would not make such
unprofitable wishes for them. Wherein note their preposterous course: when true
Prayer is warrantable, acceptable, honorable to God, and may be profitable to
him for whom it is made, being commanded of God, and agreeable to his will,
they impiously neglect it: but when there is no warrant to make it, no hope of
doing any good by it, they superstitiously use it.

Object. Mark their apology, and ye shall find it as foolish, as the thing it
self is toyish. For if any reprove them for it, presently they say, what hurt
is it?

Answ. It is hurt enough that there is no good in it: that it is vain and
idle. Mat. 12. 36.
Of every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account at the day
of judgment. Too many idle words pass from them, who are most circumspect and
watchful over their words. Is it not enough for men to let slip unawares idle
words, but that they must also justify idle prayers? Heb. 11. 6.
All things must be done in faith, 1 Cor. 10. 31
all to Gods glory, and 16. 14.
all in love. Much more Praye^ which is the most excellent and heavenly action
that can be performed. But these wishes cannot be in faith, because they have
no warrant: nor to Gods glory, because they are not agreeable to his will: nor
in love, because they can bring no profit.

Object. 2. Were we not better say, the Lord be with them, then the Devil take
them?

Answ. Is there not a mean betwixt extremes? must ye needs be superstitious,
or impious? seeing Gods determinate judgment is passed upon them, and they are
come to the place of their everlasting abode, why leave ye not them to their
own Master, and pray for the living, who may reap good by your prayers.

. 42. Of not praying for such as sin against the Holy Ghost.
2 COncerning those who sin against the Holy Ghost, 2 Prayer not to be made for
such as sin against the Holy Ghost.
1 Ioh. 5. 16.
we have an express inhibition, not to pray for them; and the reason rendered,
because it is a sin unto death: that is, (as Christ more plainly sets it
down,) Mat. 12. 31, 32.
it shall not be forgiven unto men, neither in this world, nor in the world to
come. Their judgment is as certain as if they were dead, yea and by their sin
manifested to be certain.

This sin is very hardly discerned: there is need of more then any ordinary
spirit to discover it. The ground of this sin is set and obstinate malice
against Christ and his truth made known unto them by the spirit of revelation.
The effect of it is an universal apostasy, an utter renouncing of that truth,
and that with plain blasphemy. Now seeing no man can know what is the spirit
and heart of another by an ordinary spirit, who shall judge a man to have
committed that sin? The Prophets and Apostles could discern them, as 2 Timothy
4, 14 15.
Paul discerned Alexander. Since their times we read only of one who by the
Church has been adjudged to have committed that sin, which was Julian called
the Apostate.

. 43. Of not praying for those who are apparently rejected.
3 FOr those of whom God has given an express charge to the contrary, 3
Prayer not to be made for such as are expressly rejected.
and who are expressly and apparently rejected of God, if any pray, do they not
thwart and gainsay the revealed will of God? we read not that Samuel prayed
for Saul, after the Lord expressly forbade him. 2 Samuel 16. 1.
Had Jeremiah prayed for the people, after the Lord said to him, Ier. 7. 16.
Thou shall not pray for this people, neither lift up cry or prayer for them,
neither entreat me, for I will not hear thee; he had transgressed.

. 44. Of judging the sin against the Holy Ghost.
THough these two last restraints be expressly mentioned in the Scripture, yet
we must take heed how we judge any, either to have committed that sin unto
death, or to be rejected of God: for the one there is need of an extraordinary
spirit, for the other of extraordinary revelation from God.

Quest. What if any shall profess themselves to be such?

Answ. That is no good ground for us to judge them to be such, Al who count
themselves rejected, may not be so accounted.
and to cease to pray for them. For many weak ones in temptation will judge
themselves to have sinned against the Holy Ghost, and to be rejected of God,
and thereupon neither pray for themselves, nor suffer others to pray for them.

These persons commonly have in them great grief of heart, for that wretched
estate wherein they conceive themselves to be, or if their heart be hardened,
they are grieved for that hardness, they have a longing desire to be out of
that estate, yea they have a secret love of God, and zeal of his glory, though
they feel it not, for they cannot endure to hear any blaspheme Gods holy Name
and truth: Now these are evident signs that they never fell into that
unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost.

The best advice which is first to be given unto such persons, is to persuade
them that they are more unfit to judge of their spiritual estate, then Signa
melancholiae sunt existimatio mala, timor fine causa, etc. et plurimum timoris
eius est ex eis quae non timentur secundum consuetudinem Auicen. lib. 3. fen.
1. tract. 4.
a man deeply possessed with melancholy, of his bodily health: and that the
judgment of so weighty and intricate a matter, as the sin against the Holy
Ghost is to be referred to the judgment and censure of the Church, and not of
any one particular man, except he had an extraordinary spirit. But howsoever
they like senseless patients seek their own ruin: yet let us like good
physicians and faithful friends be the more tender over them, and afford them
the best help we can, both by wise counsel and fervent Prayer.

Thus much touching the negative, who are not to be prayed for.

. 45. Of the persons who are to be prayed for.
THe affirmative, For whom prayer is to be made.
( who are to be prayed for,) is very general. For (except those before
excepted,) all of all sorts are to be prayed for. Indeed the Apostle in this
Text names none but Saints, yet simply he excludes not all other, but rather
more forcibly urges this duty for the Saints: as if he had said, whomsoever ye
forget, forget not any of the Saints: let them especially above all be
remembered. In effect so much is here employed, as is expressed. Gal. 6. 10. Let
us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of Faith.

If this place excluded all but Saints, and employed that none but they should
be prayed for, it would thwart and contradict many other places of Scripture
which shall be declared when we prove that such as are not of the Church may be
prayed for. Wherefore because the two later sort who sin against the Holy
Ghost, and who are rejected of God, are not by ordinary spirits discerned, I
may for an ordinary direction say,

All men living on earth are to be prayed for. All in general to be prayed for.
So much the Apostle himself expressly avouches. 1 Timothy 2. 1.
For in direct terms he exhorts that Prayers be made for almen. All I say,
whether they be in the Church or out of it, called or not called, friends or
foes, public or private persons, rich or poor, young or old, male or female,
bond or free, of what estate or condition soever.

I will give particular proofs of these particulars when I declare in what
order they are to be prayed for. In the mean while note these general grounds
and reasons.

1 All are made after the same image of God that we are, Reasons.
all are of the same mould, Isa. 58. 7.
all our own flesh, Luke 10. 29, etc.
all our neighbors, and therefore as other duties of love, so this which is
the most common and general duty of all is to be performed for all.

2 Besides, for ought we know all may belong to the election of God, and so
have a right to the privileges of Gods elect.

Object. Sure it is that every one is not elected, there always have been,
still are, and ever shall be a mixture of reprobats with the elect: Mat. 13. 38,
47.
for this world is Gods field, wherein are tares as well as wheat, a sea wherein
are bad things as well as good. Yea sure it is that the greater sort are
reprobates, for Mat. 22. 14.
few are chosen: and 7. 13, 14.
narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it, but
broad is the way that leads to destruction, It cannot be said of any
particular man that he belongs not to God.
and many there be which go in thereat. Non est desperandum de malis, sed pro
ipsis vt boni fiant studiosius supplicandum: quia numerus sanctorum de numero
impiorum semper auctus est. Aug. in Psalm. 36.


Answ. Though this be most true, yet can we not say of any particular man,
that he belongs not to Gods election. If he be not now called, he may
hereafter. Though he be now a wolf, he may become a lamb, as Paul did.
Wherefore to resolve this point distinctly, al men jointly together may not be
prayed for, because all belong not to Gods election. Yet all men severally
(except before excepted) may and must be prayed for. So as there is not any one
excepted. There is not any Country, any sort or condition of people, any one
man of whom we can say, he is not to be prayed for.

Object. The Pope of Rome is Antichrist, and Antichrist is branded to be 2
These. 2. 3.
that man of sin, which is, a son of perdition.

Answ. We may not conceive any particular man to be Antichrist, but rather
that seat and State where the Pope sits, or that Hierarchy, the head
whereof the Pope is, Reason.
or the succession of Popes one after another. Judicium. charitatis non
infallibilitatis.


The ground of prayer is the judgment of charity, and not of certenty. Now 1
Cor. 13. 7.
charity hops all things. It hops that they which are out of Christ's fold,
may in time be called into it, that very persecutors of the Gospel may prove
professors of the same.

I doubt not but upon this ground, and in the forenamed respect, that clause in
our public Leiturgy ( That it may please thee to have mercy on all men) is
used.

. 46. Of the order of praying for others.
FOr the order of praying for others, In what order others are to be prayed for.
prayer being one of the most proper and principal effects of love, follows
the order of love. Now the proper object of true love, is God, who by a
propriety and excellency is called 1 Ioh. 4. 16.
Love: the liker any are to God, and the nearer they come to him, the more
dearly ought they to be loved, and in love to be preferred before others:
accordingly in our prayers ought they to be preferred, as

. 47. Of praying for Saints.
1 SAints, 1 Saints.
who are here in this Text by name expressed, to show that they must most of
all be remembered. Ioh. 17. 9.
Thus did Christ pray especially for them which were given him out of the
World. And the Romans 1. 7. 1 Cor. 1, 2, 3. 1 Pet. 1. 2.
Apostles remember the Saints by name in their benedictions.

Reason 1. Of all men these are nearest, and dearest unto God, 2 Pet. 1 4.
they do most resemble him in divine qualities, and are best beloved of him.

2 Psalm. 73. 1.
God is especially good unto such; 1 Timothy 4. 10.
for he is a Savior of all men, especially of such as believe.

3 They are knit unto us by the nearest and firmest bond that can be, which is
the Spirit of Christ: 1 Cor. 12. 13
For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body. In this respect we are
said to have all Mal. 2. 10.
one Father, to be Ephesians. 4. 4.
one Body, one Spirit, yea, to be 1 Cor. 12. 12
Christ.

4 The Acts 2. 39. 2 Pet. 1. 4.
promises which are the ground of our prayers, do especially belong unto them:
so as with strongest confidence we may pray for them.

Use. Here see the privilege of Saints, Saints have all the benefit of one
another prayers.
they especially and above all have the benefit of the prayers of all their
fellow Saints. For this being commanded to all, all the Saints will have care
to perform it: yea, the Saint^ alone partake of the benefit of others prayers:
for though many wicked ones be prayed for, yet the benefit returns into their
bosom who make the prayer, as Christ said to his Disciples ( Mat. 10. 13.) If
ye salute an house, and if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

. 48. Of praying for Magistrates.
2 PVblike persons, 2. Public persons.
as Ministers of the Word, (of whom we shall more particularly speak on the
19. verse) and Magistrates, as 1 Timothy 2. 2.
Kings, with all that are in authority, whom by name the Apostle mentions,
where he exhorts to pray for others: and David by name prays for them,
saying; Psalm. 72. 1,
Give thy judgments to the King, O God, and thy righteousness to the Kings
Son. Under these may be comprised all that have any public charge over
others.

1 By reason of their office, Reasons.
they stand in Gods room, and bear Gods image; and in that respect are
called, Psalm. 82. 6.
Gods Sons, yea, Gods.

2 They are of greatest use, and in place to do most good; and in that respect
are ( 2 Samuel 18. 3.
as David's servants said of him) worth ten thousand others. 1 Timothy 2. 2
This reason alleges Saint Paul to urge this duty, that we may lead a quiet
and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty: whereby he implies, that
under God they may be an especial means for us to lead such a life.

. 49. Of praying for Friends.
3 SVch as God has linked unto us by any outward natural and civil bonds, 3.
Kindred and friends.
as Kindred, Alliance, Neighborhood, Friendship, Office, or the like. Now the
nearer ^hese bonds be, the more especially must we pray one for ^other. Genesis 2.
24.
The nearest outward bond is Matrimony, therefore husbands and wives must most
especially pray one for another, as Genesis 25. 21.
Isack for Rebecca: then parents and children, as and 17. 18.
Abram for Ismael: next brothers and sisters, as and 43. 29.
Joseph for Benjamin: and masters and servants, as and 24. 12.
Abrams servant prayed for his Master. and 39. 5.
The blessing which God bestowed on Potiphar for Joseph's sake, shows that
Joseph prayed for his Master: likewise such kindred as are out of the family
one for another, and neighbor for neighbor, friend for friend, countryman for
countryman, etc.

God has knit persons together by those outward bonds for the mutual good one
of another, that they might be more helpful one to another. In which respect
the Apostle calls these bonds, Ephesians. 4. 16.
joints of furniture, or bonds of ministration, that is, bonds whereby the
several parties that are knit together furnish one another, by receiving help
one from another, and conueighing help one to another. Now prayer is the best
means wherein and whereby we may be helpful one to another.

. 50. Of praying for strangers.
4 STrangers, 4 Strangers:
even those with whom we have no acquaintance, and to who^ we are bound by no
other bon^ then that common bond which passes betwixt man an^ man, whereby all
Adams sons are knit together. These are comprised under that general particle
all men. Ps. 67. and 117.
Ind^uers Psalms are Prayers for the Gentiles, Genesis 18. 24.
Abram prayed for the Sodomites.

Love extends it self so far. Reason.
For Leu. 19. 34.
the Law expres^ commands to love the stranger, and to and 23. 22.
be helpful unto (...) And Luke 10. 30.
Christ excellently sets it forth in the example^ the Samaritan, Reason.
that succored the wounded man who^ he found in the way.

. 51. Of praying for enemies.
5 ENemies, 5 Enemies.
even those who hate, curse, hurt and persecute us. This Mat. 5. 44.
Christ expressly commanded and Luke 23. 34.
himself also practiced, for when his enemies had spit out the venom of their
malice against him, Debemus optare etiam ijs per quos flagellarum vt
conuertantur. Aug. in Ps. 36.
and done what hurt they could unto him, he prayed for them, and said Father
forgive them. So did his Apostle, both command it, and practice it: For to
others he said, Romans 12. 14.
Bless them that persecute you. Of himself he said, 1 Cor. 4. 13.
We are evil spoken of, and we pray. While the enemies of Stephen were
throwing stones at him as thick as hail stones, Act. 7. 60.
He kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, Lord lay not this sin to
their charge.

Thus indeed shall we manifest true Christian love to be in our hearts: Reason.
for christianity teaches us to Romans 1^. 12.
overcome evil with goodness. The Scribes and Pharisees which followed the
principles of nature, taught Mat. 5. 43.
to hate enemies. So did the heathen in their best moral Philosophy. Christians
only and those true and sound Christians can attain to his extent of love: it
is impossible for a natural man to love his enemy truly and entirely: none
ever did, or can do it, but those who have the spirit of Christ in them.

. 52. Of men's failing in praying for others.


1 Not only Atheists, but even few of those that bear the title of calling
upon God, Few pray for their enemies
come to this extent of love to pray for their enemies. Many can pray for their
friends, but who for their enemies? I doubt not but many finding this point so
clearly and evidently laid down in the Scriptures, are persuaded that it is a
duty, and thereupon sometimes when their blood is cold, and the wrongs of
their enemies somewhat out of their minds, can say God forgive them: or for
form and custom sake, when they hear the Minister utter this clause of the
Letany, That it may please thee to forgive our enemies, persecuters, and
slanderers, and to turn their hearts, can answer; We beseech thee to hear us
good Lord: but from the heart to pray for them even when they wrong us, or
while their injuries are fresh in our memories (as Luke 23. 34
Christ and Act. 7. 60.
Stephen did) is a rare matter, so rare as few attain unto it: witness that
pronenesse which is in the best (if not openly to curse, and use fearful
imprecations as the worser sort do, yet) inwardly to wish, and imagine many
evils against them. This desire of revenge being one of the lusts of the flesh,
we must labor to maintain a contrary lust of the spirit, which is to love our
enemies, and pray for them: for Gal 5. 17.
The spirit lusts against the flesh. If we be led by the spirit, we shall not
fulfill the lusts of the flesh.

2 If it be a breach of love not to pray for our enemies, Many pray for none
that are strangers to them.
how great a fault is it to refuse, or forget to pray for those who never hurt
us, because they are strangers, unknown, and (as men think) they no whit
beholding unto them? Is this for Gods sake, Christ's sake, conscience sake, and
love sake, without respect of persons to perform this duty? If such knew the
benefit of Prayer, they would be glad to partake of the benefit of their
prayers who never knew them. Is it not then good reason that strangers whom
they never knew should als. partake of the benefit of their Prayers? Some pray
not for those to whom they are bound.


3 If to forget strangers be such a fault, how monstrous, inhumane, and
unnatural a thing is it, to negle^ this maine duty of love, wherein we may do
so much good, and not perform it for those to whom we are bound by particular
and peculiar bonds? not only some kinsfolk afar off, contrymen,
fellow-citizens, townes-men, parishioners, neighbors, friends, and such like,
but many which are very near of blood, of one and the same family,
bedfellowes, with the like, never pray one for another. Not husbands and wives,
parents and children, brothers and sisters, with the like: many Parents other
wise provident for their children, fail in this maine point, whereby it
comes to pass that their providence fails of the issue desired and
expected. 1 Timothy 5. 8.
The Apostle says* If there be any that provides not for his own, he denies
the faith and is worse then an Infidel. What is he then that prays not for
his own? shall not Dives rise up in judgment against such, Luke 16. 27, 28.
who being in hell prayed that Lazarus might go to his fathers house, and to
his brethren to testify unto them, lest they also should come into that place
of torment?

4 The very heathen could say that a man's country is to be preferred before
his family, Some forget their Magistrates, and Ministers.
public persons before private, yet many who profess themselves Christians,
are very unmindful of the Church and Commonwealth where they live, never
calling upon God for Ministers and Magistrates. May we not well think that
this is one cause why there are so few good, why such corruptions in both?
assuredly if God were faithfully, earnestly, instantly called upon, we should
have more store of better.

5 In the last place what may we think of those who pray not for the Saints,
Some pray not for Saints
all of whom above al other ought to be prayed for? can the love of God be in
such? But then what of such, as are so far from praying for any of them as
they curse them, Some curse them.
and wish all evil against them, in this respect, because they are Saints and
upright in heart? there be husbands that curse such wives: parents, such
children: masters, such servants: Magistrates, such subjects: Ministers, such
people: and so on the other side, wives such husbands, children such parents,
etc. So also brothers such brothers, kinsmen such kinsmen, neighbors such
neighbors, etc. Well may we think that they who thus hate whom God loves,
and curse whom God blesses, are neither loved of God, nor shall receive
blessing from him, unless they thoroughly repent. The Apostle says, pray for
all Saints, among Saints excluding none at all* they curse all Saints, even
those that are by outward bonds nearest knit unto them. This their bitter spite
against Saints, whom otherwise they could love, if they we not Saints, argues
that they have no part or fellowship in the body of Christ, nor in other
privileges of the Saints.

. 53 Of the things which we are to pray for in the behalf of others.
FOr the things which we are to ask in prayer for others, in general they
are whatsoever we may ask for our selves: for proof whereof observe the form
of the Lords prayer: in every petition, where we ask any thing for our selves,
we include others: we ask bread for others, give us our daily bread: so
likewise forgiveness of sins, freedom from temptation, and deliverance from
evil. Here therefore I might run over again al those particular points
which were before delivered concerning good things, whether temporal,
spiritual, or eternal, to be prayed for, and evil things whether evil of
fault, or evil of punishment to be prayed against, and apply them to prayers
made for others: but that heedeth not; only here observe this general rule,
that according to the needs of others, are prayers to be made for them.

1 If they be not called, Ideo de terra erectus est Paulus, quia in terra
inclinatus exauditus est Stephanus. Aug. ser. 4 de Stephan.
pray that they may be converted: no doubt but Christ's prayer on the cross was
the cause that so many Jews after his death were converted. The like may be
said of Steuens prayer.

2 If they be called, pray that they may be established, and grow in grace, as
Col. 1. 9.
Saint Paul did.

3 If they have sinned, Iam. 5. 15.
pray that their sins may be forgiven.

4 If they be sick, Iam. 5. 15.
pray that they may be raised.

5 If they be wrongfully imprisoned, Heb. 13. 18. 19.
that they may be delivered, and so according to other needs.

. 54. This Gods will not known, is no sufficient cause to hinder prayer for
others.
Object. THus may we cross Gods determined purpose, by praying for those
things which God does not purpose to grant: as to pray for a man's life, when
his time of departure is come.

Answ. 1. The same might be objected against prayer for our selves: and then
what prayer should be made?

2 Gods revealed will is the rule and ground of our prayers: we are not to
search into his secret counsel: but whatsoever we find warranted in the word,
to pray for.

3 In all prayers for others, we must pray with limitation, and subjection to
Gods will: there is nothing for which we can pray so absolutely in the behalf
of others, as in our own behalf: for we cannot know the estate of others, so
well as of our selves;

. 55. Of imprecations against ones self.
THe fourth and last branch of Prayer is Expostulation, IIII. Kind. Imprecation.
or Imprecation against others, which is a kind of Prayer whereby judgment and
vengeance is desired.

In handling this point, I will show,

1 What the persons be against whom imprecations may be made.

2 In what respect they may be made.

For the persons, No man must pray against himself.
No man may pray against himself: we have no warrant in all the Scripture for
it, and therefore it must needs be a matter of impiety: besides it is against
very nature it self, for Ephesians. 5. 29.
No man ever yet hated himself, and therefore it must needs be matter of
iniquity and injury.

Object. Many of the Saints have made imprecations against themselves, as 2 Samuel 3. 35
David, Solomon, and other, who in their oaths used these and such like words,
1 Kin. 2. 23.
God do so to me, and more also.

Answ. 1. When an oath is taken in Ier. 4. 2.
truth, not falsely, in judgment, not rashly, in righteousness, not
wrongfully, the imprecation expressed or employed therein, is not simply made,
as if he that took the oath desired any such thing to fall upon himself, but
used only for a more vehement testification of the truth to move the hearer
the rather to give credence thereunto; or else to bind him that swears the
more steadfastly to perform his oath.

2 If any of the Saints have used imprecations in an oath falsely, as Mat. 26.
74
Peter* or rashly, as Ios. 9. 14. 15.
the Princes in Ioshuahs time, or wrongfully, as 1 Samuel 25. 22
David; their examples are no good warrant.

Object. 2. A wife suspected by her husband, Number. 5. 22. expounded.
was bound by the Law to make imprecations against herself.

Answ. She was not bound to do so. For if she were free of the crime laid to
her charge, that imprecation wa^ no imprecation: but if she were guilty, then
she ought to acknowledge her fault, and not curse her self. If being guilty,
she assented to that imprecation, it was her own fault and not the bond of the
Law.

Use. How impious are they against God, how injurious against their own
souls, Reproof of usual imprecations against ones self.
who upon every light occasion, yea and that many times falsely (for common rash
swearers are oftentimes falseswearers,) do imprecate direful vengeance against
themselves, as, I would I might never stir, I would I might never eat bread
more, I would I might die presently, I would I might be swallowed up quick, I
would I might be damned. Oh fearefull^ the Jews of ancient time were so
fearful of uttering imprecations, that when in their oaths they had occasion
to use them, they would either express them in general terms, thus, 2 Samuel 3
35.
God do so to me, and more also: or else leave them clean out, and make the
sentence imperfect, as, if I do this or if I do not that, or if this be so, and
there stay. Thus Psalm. 13. 2, 3, 4. (...)
David, If I enter into the Tabernacle of mine house: If I go up into my
bed; If I give sleep to mine eyes: And thus Zedekiah unto the Prophet
Jeremiah: ler. 3. 8. 16.
As the Lord lives which made us this soul: if I put thee to death, If I give
thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life. Yea thus God himself,
Psalm. 89. 35.
I have sworn, if I lie unto David. And again, and 95. 11.
I swear in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest. To show that this is
the right translation of that form of speech, Heb. 3. 11. (...).
the Apostle alleging that form of Gods oath so translateth it. What does
this teach us, but that we should be very fearful to utter any imprecation
against our selves, especially to do it falsely or rashly? the Jews, which
caused Christ to be crucified, and their posterity to this day have felt the
woe and curse of that imprecation which they made against themselves, when they
said to Pilat of Christ, Mat. 27. 25.
His blood be upon us and our children: So has God caused the vengeance of
many others imprecations to fall upon their own necks, and that in just
judgment.

. 56. Of the persons against whom imprecation may be made.
WHerefore lawful and warrantable imprecations, Imprecations against public
and desperate enemies.
are to be made against others, and those other to be enemies (enemies I say,
not our own private enemies in particular causes, betwixt us and them: for
these must be prayed for, as we heard. 51.
before, but public) such as are enemies to God, his Church and Gospel, yea
also obstinate, desperate, reprobate enemies, who neither will nor can be
reclaimed: as were Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, Numb. 16. 15
against whom Moses prayed. Such were those against whom David so earnestly
prayed, Psalm. 109. 67, etc. and Gal. 5. 12.
whom S. Paul wished to be cut off. Such an one was Alexander concerning whom
S. Paul thus prayed, 2 Timothy 4. 14.
The Lord reward him according to his works, meaning his evil works.

1. Quest. How can such be discerned?

Answ. By an ordinary spirit they cannot be discerned, but only by an
extraordinary spirit, even such a spirit as the Prophets and Apostles had, to
whom God by his spirit revealed what such and such persons were against whom
they prayed. Wherefore when the Disciples would have caused fire to come down
from heaven and consume the Samaritans, Luke 9. 54, 55.
Christ said unto them, Ye know not of what spirit ye are.

2 Quest. How then may ordinary persons make imprecations against any?

Ans. No ordinary man can lawfully make any imprecation against the persons of
any particular distinct men: Imprecations may be made in three respects.
Only in these three respects may imprecations be made.

1. 1 Indefinitely.
Indefinitely, against all such public desparate enemies as were noted before,
without any application of the imprecation to any particular persons, no not so
much as in thought: and thus was that general imprecation used when the Arc
went forward, Number. 10. 35.
Rise up Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered. And thus David uses many
general imprecations, as Psalm. 25. 3.
Let them be confounded which transgress without cause. and 122. 5.
Let them all be confounded that hate Sion, etc.

2. 2 Conditionally.
Conditionally, as when we observe any to persist obstinately in persecuting
the Saints, and suppressing the Gospel, to desire, that if they belong to God,
it would please God to turn their heart, or else if they belong not to him, to
confound them: thus may impreiations be directed against particular men.

3. 3 Against malicious deeds.
Without any respect at all unto their persons, lea^uing them unto God, against
their malicious plots and wicked deeds: thus David prayed against the wicked
policy of Achitophel, 2 Samuel 15. 31
saying, O Lord I pray thee turn the counsel of Achitophel into foolishness.

. 57. Of the unlawfulness of usual imprecations.
AS for those usual imprecations, Use. Reproof of usual imprecations.
direful and hateful imprecatio^s, such as my heart abhors to think of, and
my tongue is ashamed to name, which profane and wicked men make against their
neighbors, upon every petty wrong and slight occasion, they can neither stand
with any true fear of God, nor love to man. For to call upon God who is Neh.
9. 17.
A God of long suffering, and great forbearance, Psalm. 103. 8.
full of compassion and slow to anger, to be a revenger of every little injury,
argues little respect of his greatness and goodness. To wish Gods heavy
vengeance to fall upon the body, soul, goods, or any other things which belong
unto our neighbor, discovers much malice, no love. Such were those of whom
David thus speaks. Psalm. 5. 9.
Their throat is an open sepulcher, and 140. 3.
The poison of Aspes is under their lips, and 10. 7.
Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Many men's tongues are so
poisonous and fiery (being Iam. 3. 6.
set on fire of hell) that like mad dogs they spare none, but curse and ban
the most innocent and harmless that be: yea, (which is horrible to hear)
some curse their wives, children, servants, friends, the nearest and dearest
unto them that be, not for any wrong or evil, but because they are, as they
term them, Puritans; but in truth honest and upright hearted, fearful to
commit the least evil, conscionable in doing all duty (so near as they can)
to God and man.

. 58. Of the Popes manner of cursing.
AMong and above all others, he that takes upon him to be the Vicar of Christ,
and successor of Peter, does exceed in hellish imprecations, and devilish
execrations: for he uses, not suddenly and rashly, but deliberately and
advisedly, in and at his solemn serving of God, to curse with bell, book, and
candle, and that to the very pit of hell, no meaner personages then the Lords
Anointed, Kings and Queens, together with their Subjects and whole Kingdoms,
and that for maintaining the true, ancient, Catholic, and Apostolic Faith.

Of him and all other which unjustly and unchristianly use such fearful
imprecations, if in time they repent not, I may use the words of David. Psalm.
109. 17, 18.
As he loved cursing, so shall it come unto him: as he clothed himself with
cursing like a raiment, so shall it come into his bowels like water, and like
oil into his bones.

Hitherto of those several kinds of prayer which are comprised under request.
The next kind is thanksgiving.

. 59. Of Thanksgiving.
Our Apostle gives an excellent direction for thanksgiving, in the twentieth
verse of the fifth Chapter of this Epistle, which because it is so fit for our
present purpose, I will here handle. His words are these,

Ephesians. 5. 20. Give thanks always for all things unto God, even the Father,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

IN this direction are laid down five particular points.

1 The duty it felfe, give thanks.

2 The person to whom it is to be performed, to God, even the Father.

3 The Mediator, in whose name it is to be performed, in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

4 The matter of thanksgiving, all things.

5 The continuance thereof, always.

1 For the duty or thing it self, What thanksgiving is.
Thanksgiving is a grateful acknowledgement of a kindness received.

A kindness done, is the object of thanksgiving, yet unless the kindness
done be accepted, and withal acknowledged to be a kindness, the heart of him
to whom the kindness is done, will not be affected to give him that did it,
thanks for it.

1 Samuel 25. 5, etc.
David did a great kindness for Nabal, as Nabals servants could testify: yet
Nabal acknowledged it to be no kindness; and that made him to be so churlish
and ungrateful to David.

. 60. Of the person to whom all thanks is due.
2 THe person to whom thanks is due, Thanks is to be given to God.
is God the Father. Father has reference especially unto the only begotten
son of God Christ Jesus, as is more plainly expressed in these words, Ephesians. 1. 3.
Blessed be God even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. So as this clause
does note out the first person in Trinity: yet does it not exclude the other
two persons: for thanksgiving belongs to the whole Trinity. S. Paul expressly
gives thanks to 1 Timothy 1. 12.
Jesus Christ: and yet excludes not the Father or the holy Ghost: for what
honor or worship soever is rightly performed to either of the persons, is also
performed to every of them. But here and in many other places, this title
Father (which is propper to the first person) is added, to show how our praises
come to be acceptable unto God, namely as God is the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and in him our gracious and loving Father.

Iam. 1. 17.
Saint James renders a weighty reason to prove that all thanks is to be given
to God, Reason.
and to God alone, for says he, every good giving and every perfect gift
comes from the Father. Good things come from God, God is the author and giver
of them; God therefore is to be praised for them.

Every good thing comes from God: therefore all praise is due to him.

. 61. Of the difference of thanks given to God and men.
Quest. ARe not Creatures to be thanked for any kindness done by them?

Answ. Not in that manner as God is to be thanked. God is simply, in and for
himself to be praised.

Simply, that is without any restraint, with all our heart, with all our soul,
and with all our might, and that for all his works whatsoever.

In and for himself, that is, in respect of no other whatsoever: For God is
the very fountain, the first and only Author, the principal giver of the
good things we enjoy. The things which we receive by the ministry of any
creature, originally we receive from God. Creatures are but the Stewards,
Messengers, Ministers, and as it were Carriers of God: they bring Gods
blessings one to another. Wherefore they are not simply in and for themselves
to be thanked for any thing. The thanks which is given to them (if it be
rightly given) is given them in the Lord, under him, only for their pains and
care in bringing Gods blessings unto us. Simile.
When a personage of great state and place sends a present by his servant,
will he to whom that present is sent, thank the servant that brought it, or
the Master that sent it? Surely I suppose he will both desire the servant to
thank his Master, and also when he has opportunity himself, thank him: if
he thank the bearer, it is only for his pains in bringing the gift, not for
the gift it self: yea, though he reward the messenger for his pains, yet he
gives the thanks to him that sent the gift. Thus is thanks properly due to
the original author of a kindness: all thanks therefore is properly due to
God, from whom every good thing comes.

. 62. Of the Mediator, in whose name thanks is to be given.
3 THe Mediator, 3 Thanks to be rendered to God in the mediation of Christ.
in whose name thanks is to be given to God, is entitled by the Apostle, Our
Lord Jesus Christ.

The first title Lord, implies that Mat. 28. 18.
power and regiment which the Father has given him (as he is Mediator Godman)
over all creatures. This regiment he exercises for the good of us who are of
his Church, and therefore by a kind of propriety he is called Our Lord.

The second title JESUS, which signifies a Savior, sets forth that
all-sufficient, full, and perfect redemption and salvation, which he wrought
for mankind. The reason of this name and title is rendered by an Angel unto
Joseph, in these words; Mat. 1. 21.
Thou shall call his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins.

The third title CHRIST, (which signifies Anointed) implies the three Offices
of Christ, whereunto he was anointed, and set a part of his Father: his
Princely Office to govern and protect his Church; his Priestly Office, to
offer himself a sacrifice, and to make continual intercession for his Church.
His Prophetical Office to instruct, and direct his Church in the way of
Salvation.

In the name of this Our Lord Jesus Crhist, must all the calves of our lips,
all our praises be offered up unto God. Heb. 13. 15.
Let us by him (says the Apostle, speaking of Christ Jesus) offer the
sacrifice of praise. This point was before handled in the general doctrine of
Prayer.

. 63. Of the matter of Thanksgiving.
4 THe matter of thanksgiving is very ample and large, 4 Thanks to be given
for all things.
limited with no restraint, but extended to al things. So that whatsoever the
Lord does, affords matter of praise to the Saints. Often is this general
particle all used in this point; 1 These 5 18
In all things give thanks, says the Apostle in another place: Psalm. 103. 2.
Forget not all his benefits, says David.

Romans 8. 28.
We know that all things work together for good to them that love God: Reason,
If all things work to our good, is it not just and meet that thanks should
be given for all things.

That we may somewhat more distinctly discern the matter of thanksgiving, I
will set down in order some particular branches of this general point.

The matter of Thanksgiving may sundry ways be distinguished.

1 In regard of the nature, or kind of benefits,

They are Good things bestowed. Evil things removed.


2 In regard of the quality of them, They are Spiritual. Temporal.


3 In regard of the manner of bestowing them. They are already given. promised
to be given.


4 In regard of the persons upon whom they are bestowed,

which are Our selves. Others.


Under these general heads there are many particular branches, which I will in
order declare.

. 64. Of the spiritual blessings, for which thanks is to be given.
Spiritual blessings are Bestowed here on Earth. Reserved in Heaven.
Spiritual^ ^lessings.



In the rank of the former kind of spiritual blessings, these particulars
following must be accounted.

1 The ground of them, which is Election. Together with which we are to reckon
the cause thereof, Gods free grace and rich mercy, and also the fruit thereof,
certenty of salvation.

2 The meritorious cause of them; namely, our Redemption, under which we must
comprise, the price of our redemption, Christ's blood, and the special fruits
thereof, as Reconciliation, Adoption, Remission of sins, imputation of
righteousness, etc.

3 The means of applying the benefits of our election and redemption, namely,
the effectual operation of Gods Spirit: under this head are comprised
effectual vocation, regeneration, sanctification, and all those particular
sanctifying graces, which we find and feel to be wrought in us, as Knowledge,
Faith, Hope, Love, Repentance, Patience, new Obedience, etc. together with the
blessed fruits of them, as peace of conscience, joy in the spirit, holy
security, with the like.

Finally the means which the Spirit uses to work, and increase all these
graces, are to be remembered, which are the Ministry of the Word,
Administration of the Sacraments, and other holy Ordinances of God, together
with liberty of the Sabbaths, of good and faithful Ministers, of public
Assemblies, with the like.

Those eternal blessings which are in Heaven reserved for us, 2 Eternal
blessings.
are such, as Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the
heart of man. We cannot in particular reckon them up: yet in the general we
must have our hearts filled with an holy admiration of them, and our mouths
with praise for them.

. 65. Of the temporal blessings, for which thanks is to be given.
Temporal blessings for which thanks is to be given, 3 Temporal blessings.
are such as concern,

1 Mankind in general, as creation, and preservation of Man: Gods providence
over him, and all the fruits and benefits of these.

2 The whole Church thorowout the World: the increase, peace, and prosperity of
it: particularly the Churches in that Land where we live.

3 Commonwealths: and in particular that Commonwealth whereof we our selves
are members: and therein in good Magistrates, good Laws, peace, plenty, etc.

4 Families: especially our own: and therein good Governors, good servants,
good parents, good children, a competency of goods to maintain the state of
it. If God give not only sufficiency, but also abundance, more thanks is to
be given.

5 Our own persons; and in regard of them sou^dnes of mind, health of body,
ability to perform the work of our calling, Gods blessing on our labor and
calling, with the like.

. 66. Ofgiuing thanks for removing evils.
EVils removed, for which thanks is to be given, are Public. Private. both
these Spiritual. Temporal.




Temporal public evils arise from the enemies of the Church, Commonwealth.
Temporal public evils removed,



Thanks therefore is to be given when those enemies are either ouerthrown, or
converted: or when their conspiracies are discovered, and we preserved from
their mischievous practices, whether by wars, invasions, treasons,
rebellions, or privy and secret plots, with the like. To this head may be
referred, deliverance from plagues, famines, fires, inundations, etc.

Spiritual public evils, are common public sins, Spiritual public evils
removed.
maintained by law, or common practice Public sins which use to be in
diverse countries maintained by law, are Idolatry, Superstition, Heresies,
Usury, Play Houses, Brothel-houses, etc. Public sins maintained in many
places by common practice are Swearing, Pro^hanenesse, Drunkenness,
Vncl^anenesse, Pride and bravery in apparel, etc. When and where it pleases
the Lord to afford a^ny means of reforming, and restraining these public
sins, then and there is matter of thanksgiving afforded.

Spiritual private evils, Spiritual private evils removed.
are either such particular sins whereunto our selves are most given, or the
causes of such sins (as the temptations of Satan, or evil lusts, and the vain
allurements of others) or else a spiritual punishment of them (as trouble of
mind, hardness of heart, a tormenting conscience, a seared and senseless
conscience, etc.) They who are delivered out of any of these snares must be
thankful for that deliverance.

Private temporll evils, Private temporal evils removed.
are such outward judgments as God in anger inflicteth on men as punishments
also of sin: such are penury, ignominy, pain, grief, sickness, loss of
goods, loss of friends, and other like crosses. The removing of these is
matter of thanksgiving.

. 67. Of giving thanks for crosses.
YEt are not outward temporal judgments, Temporal judgments not always to
be accounted evils.
whether public or private, always to be simply accounted evils, but many
times to be reckoned and accounted in the number of Gods blessings. For Heb.
12. 5, 6, 7, etc.
God often inflicteth them on his children, and that in love, for their good.
They are indeed grievous, and irksome to the flesh, but many times profitable
to the soul: an heavy burden they are, but they bring forth a good and
precious fruit: wherefore in regard of them, we must wholly refer our selves to
Gods will, as Mat. 26. 39.
Christ did in his bitter agony. If God be pleased to preserve us from them,
or being fallen upon us, to remove them, we are to account this preservation
and deliverance, Outward crosses are matter of thanksgiving.
a blessing and favor of the Lord, and to be thankful unto God for it. But
otherwise if it please the Lord to lay any cross upon us, or when it lies on
us, still to continue it, we are also to take this as a token of love, and to be
thankful. The reason is evident. For God being very wise, and knowing what is
best for us (even much better then we our selves) and withal being a loving
and tender father, Non tantum pro his quae bona putamus, sed etiam quae nos
coartant in Dei praeconium men's laeta prorumpat. Hieron. in Ephesians. 5.
exceeding careful of our good, he does so dispose our estate, as may most
make to our good. When he sees it to be needful, he lays affliction upon
us: when it has lien long enough upon us, then he rem oueth it. In this kind
he deals with his children, as skillful and tender Physicians or Chirurgians
do with their patients, whose cure they seek. Now therefore upon this ground,
we are to think every estate whereunto the Lord brings us to be the best for
us: health to be the best when we are in health, and sickness to be best,
when we are sick: abundance to be best while we have it, and want to be best
when we are in want, and so of other estates. Therefore when the Lord does lay
upon us any outward afflictions, we must put them on the score of Gods
favors: especially the good fruits of afflictions, as true humiliation, sound
repentance, christian watchfulness, righteousness, etc. Now then to conclude
this point, afflictions being tokens of Gods love, tending to the good of the
Saints, they are comprised under this general clause ALL THINGS, and are matter
of thanksgiving.

. 68. Of the proofs of Scripture applied to particular occasions of
thanksgiving.
I Shall not need to enter into any further enumeration of other particulars:
I will therefore aleadge some proofs of these out of Gods word.

1 For all manner of spiritual blessings, note that general form of
thanksgiving used by the Apostle, Ephe. 1. 3. Blessed be God which has blessed
us with all spiritual blessings: read the verses following, and ye shall see
how he reckons up many of those spiritual blessings in particular, as
Election, Redemption, Adoption, Vocation, etc.

2 For temporal blessings we have sundry approved patterns of thanksgiving in
diverse kinds: Ioh. 6 11.
Christ gave thanks for food: 1 Samuel 2. 1.
Annah for a child: Genesis 32 10.
Jacob for riches: and 24. 48.
Abraham's servant for prospering his journey.

3 For blessings on others, note the example of 1. King. 10. 9.
Queen of Sheba, who blessed God for his blessings on Israel: and of the Act.
11. 18.
Christian Jews who glorfied God for the Gospel revealed to the Gentiles.

4 For public blessings concerning the Church, Col. 1. 3. 6.
the Apostle gives thanks that the Gospel came into all the world. And Act.
2. ^7.
the Christians praise God for the increase, and peace of the Church, and and 4
24.
for the liberty of the Apostles.

5 For the commonwealth, the Jews rejoice (which was a public testimony of
their thanksgiving to God) 1. King. 1. 40.
for settling the state, and establishing the crown on Solomon. So again, and
8. 62. 66.
for continuing the peace and prosperity of the Land.

6 For general blessings on mankind Psalm. 8. 1, 6.
David praised God.

7 For Gods blessings on his family, Genesis 35. 7.
Jacob is thankful, and in testimony thereof builds an alter to God.

8 For private blessings, Genesis 39. 5.
Leah praised God that had given her a Son: and Isa. 38. 19.
Hezekiah for recovery of his health.

9 For evils removed, Exo. 15.
Moses and the Israelites blessed God who overthrew their enemies: Psalm. 124. 6.
and David praised God for preserving his people from their enemies: and Gal.
1. 23.
the Christians glorify God for the Conversion of Saul, a mortal enemy of
the Church.

10 For public spiritual evils removed, 2. Chr. 29. 30
praise is sung unto the Lord in Hezekiah^ time when the Land was purged from
Idolatry.

11 For private spiritual evils prevented, 1. Sam. 25. 32
David blessed God, who kept him from auenging himself, and shedding innocent
blood.

12 For adversity Job. 1. 21.
Job blessed God: and Act. 5. 41.
the Apostles rejoice for suffering persecution.

13 Final^y for good things promised and not inioyed, Heb. 11. 13.
it is noted that the Patriarchs received not the promises, but saw them a
far off, and believed them, and received them thankfully.

. 69. Of the abundant matter of thanksgiving.
HEre we see what abundant matter of thanksgiving is offered unto us. If we
should spend our whole time (as the triumphant Church in heaven does) in
lauding and praising God, we could not want matter, considering that ALL
THINGS are matter of thanksgiving.

If I should say we have more matter of thanksgiving then of petition, More
matter of thanksgiving then of petition.
I should not speak amiss: for the blessings which any of Gods children, any
of those who truly believe in Christ, have received already, are much more, and
far greater then the things which they want. God has long since elected and
chosen them to be vessels of mercy and glory: when he created man, as he made
man most happy, according to the image of God, so before he made man he created
all things needful for him, that so he might be destitute of no good thing:
for he made heaven and the whole host thereof, earth and all the fruits of
it, yea the air and water and all creatures in them; in a word God made all
things that were made, for the good of man. The price of man's redemption is
already paid: All true believers are reconciled to God, adopted to be his
children, made actual members of Christ's body, effectually called, and taken
into the kingdom of grace, being perfectly justified even in Gods sight by the
righteousness of Christ Jesus. What are the spiritual blessings which we
want, that may be comparable to these which we have received?

Object. 1. We have not received freedom from, and full victory over all sin.

Answ. How far we are freed from sin.
Sin has received a deadly wound: though it assail us, yet shall it not get
conquest over us. Besides the guilt and punishment of those very sins, which
yet we are subject unto, shall not be laid upon us: they are clean remitted,
and in that respect we fully acquitted.

Object. 2. We want many good and comfortable graces, and fail in the measure
of those we have: our sanctification is not perfect.

Answ. How far sanctified.
All the faithful have al such graces as are absolutely necessary unto
salvation, actually wrought in them. As a child borne of a woman has all the
parts of soul and body, so he that is borne again of God has all the parts of
a new man. No Saint wants any grace that may hinder his salvation, though he
should instantly die. As for that measure which some want, it is not so great
as can justly impeach the truth of grace: that grace which they have is true,
though it may be weak: and their sanctification is sound, though imperfect.
The perfecting of sanctification is not so great and powerful a work, as the
first beginning of it. The most effectual and powerful work of Gods spirit
in the faithful, is their very new birth, the first act of their conversion.
For when a sinner is first converted, he is a new created: of nothing (I speak
in regard of of our spiritual being) he is made something: of a man dead in
sin, he is quickened, and has spiritual life put into him. Now the growth in
sanctification, is but a proceeding from one degree to another in the same
kind: yea the very perfection of sanctification is but an attaining to the
highest step and degree of that which was begun before. It is therefore a more
powerful work to beget a sinner to God, and to work his first conversion,
then after he is regenerate and converted to perfect that good work which is
begun. Whence it follows that faithful Saints have more matter of
rejoicing for the grace they have received, then of mourning for the grace they
want.

Object. We want the possession of our heavenly inheritance.

Answ. How far we are made partakers of heaven.
1. The purchase of it is made: for Christ by his blood has purchased it.

2 We have received the first fruits of it, as peace of conscience, joy in
the holy Ghost, free entrance unto the throne of grace and glory, with
confidence in Christ and the like.

3 We are actually entered into the kingdom of grace, which is a part of the
kingdom of glory, the first step thereinto, and the portall (as I may so say)
thereof: no entering into the kingdom of glory, but through the kingdom of grace.

4 We have the earnest of the spirit, as a pledge and pawn till we come to
the full possession of the purchased inheritance.

5 Christ our head has full and actual possession thereof: Ephe. 2. 6.
whereupon we being members of his body, are in him exalted, and set in
heavenly places.

In these fine forenamed respects we may truly say that the faithful in
Christ have more cause to glorify God for that assurance they have of inioying
their heavenly inheritance, then to murmr or mourn that for a time ^hey want
the full possession of it. Thus we see that in re^ard of spiritual blessings,
we have more matter of praise ^or that we have, then of petition for that we
want. I might here further rank among these spiritual blessings, the liberty
of the Lords Sabbaths, of the Ministry of his word, and administration of his
Sacraments, of the public assemblies of Saints to worship God, with the like,
which we among others plentifully enjoy: I migh also further declare how God
has already caused his whole will to be revealed, and recorded in his word, so
far forth as is needful for our salvation, and expedient for us to know: all
which do much amplify the forenamed point: But I hasten to set forth a view
also of some of those temporal blessings whereof we have been, and are made
pertakers. They are exceeding many, as our Being, Life, Nourishment, Education,
Health, Strength, Food, Apparel, Goods, Friends, etc. Gods blessing on all
these, and on the Church and state wherein we live. Whether-soeuer we turn our
selves, or cast our eyes, either upwards to the heavens, and the whole host of
them, or downward on the earth, and all the fruits thereof: or up and down on
all the creatures in the air, on the earth, and in the waters, on the right
hand or on the left, before or behind, every where the blessings of God do
present themselves to our view and consideration. By this which has thus
generally been spoken, I doubt not but any of mean capacity may observe that
none of the Saints do want so many good things as they have received.

Object. Many of the Saints do want even necessaries to preserve this
temporal life, Luke 16. 21.
as Lazarus.

Answ. Why many Saints want outward things.
1. God sees it to be good for them to want such necessaries.

2 Instead of these outward necessaries, they have inward graces which are much
more valuable and profitable as instead of of outward refreshing of the body,
they have inward comfort of the soul: instead of outward ornaments of the
body, inward graces of the spirit: wanting outward ease, they have sweet peace
of conscience: wanting plenty, they have contentment: In a word, God depriueth
his children of no outward thing, but he supplieth the want of it with some
spiritual recompense: their want therefore causes matter of thanksgiving.

As all the Saints have received more good things then they want, Saints are
freed from more evils then shall ever fall upon them again.
so also undoubtedly are they freed from more evils then justly they can fear
to fall upon them. For believing in Christ, they are freed from the fear of
hell, from the curse of the Law, from the wrath of God, from the sting of
death, from the victory of the grave, from the power of him that has the power
of death, the devil; from the guilt and punishment of sin, from the rule and
dominion of sin, and from infinitely more, both spiritual, and bodily evils.

Object. Many Saints are subject both to many spiritual evils, (as trouble of
mind, doubt of Gods favor, snares of the Devil, fallings into sin, with
the like,) and also to many temporal distresses, as pain, sickness,
captivity, imprisonment, ignominy, penury, etc.

Answ. How spiritual evils may prove matter of thanksgiving.
Those spiritual evils are as desperate physic for the cure of some
spiritual desperate disease, as spiritual security, pride, presumption, etc.
Now who will deny but that it is good in a desperate case to use a desperate
remedy? If the remedy cause recovery, he that uses it shall be commended, and
rewarded? But whenever God suffers any of his children to fall into any of
the forenamed, or other like spiritual evils, he works thereby a recovery
from some more dangerous and desperate evil: therefore the issue and effect
even of those evils affords matter of thanksgiving.

As for temporal distresses, I have showed. 67.
before how they may be put on the score of Gods blessings. To that which was
before delivered, 2. Cor. 4. 16. Christianorum propria virtus est, etiam in iis
quae aduersa putantur refer gratias Creatori. Hier. in Ephe. 5.
let me ad this, that God does always so dispose of the estat of the Saints,
that he makes the decaying of the outward man to be a renewing of the inner
man. In these respects it is a virtue propper to Christians, to give thanks to
God for such things as seem evil.

Besides, Promise of supplying all our wants.
God has faithfully promised to supply in due time whatsoever his Saints want,
and to perfect every thing that fails in perfection, and withal to deliver
them from all evil. Now then add these promises (which are also matter of
thanksgiving) to the abundance of good things which already we have received,
and to the manifold deliverances which we have had from evils, and it will
appear as clear as the light, that of all duties belonging to faithful
Christians this of praise and thanksgiving is most beseeming them, and least of
all to be neglected: It is the least that God deserves, the most that he
requires, and the best that we can give unto him: the best sacrifice in the
kind thereof which we can offer unto God, and that which God does best
accept: for note what God says hereof, Psalm. 50. 23. 22.
He that offers praise, glorifieth me. I might much further amplify and
enlarge these points. But as Painters, when they have many millions, and armies
of men to set down in a small map, Simile.
use only to draw out some number of heads of men and set them together,
leaving the whole number of heads, and all the other parts and liniaments to
the meditation of the beholder: even so am I constrained through abundance of
matter to propound only some general heads of this point of thanksgiving and
to leave the amplification of them to your private meditation.

. 70 Of their blindness who can see no matter of thanksgiving.


To leave men's private practice whereof we cannot so ^ell judge: observe that
which is in more open view. What public prayer books so pleintiful in
thanksgiving (...) in request? What Ministers almost so careful in performing
that, as this? I blame not all without exception: many there be who are
conscionable in this point: but I tax the greater sort. For many of them who
use solemn and ample forms of Petition, commonly include all their
thanksgiving in this, (or such like) short clause, Through Jesus Christ, to
whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be all honor and glory for ever, Amen.

. 71. Of Men's failing in the extent of Thanksgiving.
But to let pass those also that offend in the general neglect of this duty:
there are other who being somewhat careful of the duty in general, 1 Some are
not thankful for spiritual blessings.
fail exceedingly in the extent of it: they give not thanks for ALL THINGS.
Some can be thankful for temporal blessings, as for peace, plenty,
seasonable weather, deliverance from invasions, rebellions, treasons, from
fire, plagues, famine, sickness, etc. But it seems they take no notice of
spiritual blessings: their mouths are very seldom or never opened to bless
God for them. They show themselves to be too earthly minded.

Other can be thankful for private blessings bestowed on themselves, 2 Some
not for public blessings.
or on their families and friends; but regard not public blessings bestowed on
Church or commonwealth: they account general blessings no blessings. These
discover too much self-love, too little sense of the common good.

Other (who it may be) will be thankful for such public blessings as are
bestowed on that Church and Commonwealth, 3 Some not for the good of others.
whereof they themselves are members, never hearken after, nor care to hear of
such as a^ bestowed on the Churches of God in other Countries or if they do
hear of them, very little (if at all) are they affected therewith. Much less
are they affected with an^ blessings bestowed on private Christians, who are
not of their kindred, alliance, acquaintance, with the like. This also shows
that they have no fellow-feeling of the good of the mystical body of Christ,
or of the several members thereof; which might make them fear that they
themselves are scarce sound members of that body: if they were, there would
assuredly be some sympathy betwixt themselves and other members, some mutual
compassion, and fellow-feeling: they would rejoice with them that rejoice. Nay
further, these show (which is worse) what little zeal they have of Gods glory:
for to take notice of Gods mercies on others, as well as on our selves, to
talk of them, to be thankful for them, does much amplify the glory of Gods
works: it makes them to be more famous. How many more the persons be that
praise God for any blessings, so much greater glory redoundeth to Gods name:
therefore Psalm. 118. 1. etc.
David often stirs up others besides himself to praise God for favors
bestowed on himself.

Further, 4 Some not for adversity.
many may be thankful for prosperity, but very few will be so for adversity.
To be thankful for pain, sickness, penury, ignominy, imprisonment, loss
of goods, loss of friends, with the like, is a rare matter. These things cause
rather in most men murmuring, and repining against God. For few consider the
blessed fruit that comes from those things, neither think that they can be
any blessings. These show how they walk by sense, and not by faith.

Finally, among those who are thankful for such blessings as they enjoy, 5
Some not for blessings to come.
how few lift up the eyes of their faith further then the eyes of their body
can reach? how few consider those good things which God has promised for the
time to come? how few can praise God for any good thing, whereof they have not
the present fruition? Most think it enough to praise God for such things as
they have; they little consider that the matter of thanksgiving extends not
only to benefits received, but also to benefits promised. These manifest
little credence to the truth of Gods word: if they were fully resolved thereof,
they would account Gods words to be very deeds.

Thus we see how faulty most are in the performance of this duty, and how
short they come of this general extent of Thanksgiving, which is without
restraint; for ALL THINGS. Let us examine our own souls in this point, and be
conscionable even in this extent.

Because this fourth branch concerning the matter of Thanksgiving, is on the
one side a point worthy to be observed: and on the other side, a point too too
much neglected, I have been bold to insist the longer upon it.

. 72. Of the time of giving Thanks.
THe last branch concerning this point of Thanksgiving, respects the time,
which is expressed under as large an extent as the former branch, concerning
the matter, That was for (...).
ALL THINGS, This is, ALVVAIES. Of this branch I shall not need now in
particular to speak, because it is. 117.
afterward to be handled in the general doctrine of Prayer.

. 73. Directions for Thanksgiving.
BEfore I conclude this point of Thanksgiving, I will add^ some few directions,
which being well observed, will be very helpful unto us in the performance of
this duty.

The first is, 1 Lift up eyes to the author of blessings.
that we lift up our eyes unto the Author o^ all blessings, and be persuaded
that they come from God^ and are brought unto us by Gods good guiding
providence; and not (as the vulgar and ignorant sort of people think and
speak) by chance, luck, fortune, and the like. It was Isreal's fault, Ose. 2.
8.
that she did not know that God gave her corn and wine, etc: which made her
so ungrateful and rebellious against God. Isa. 1. 3.
The like reason is given of Iudahs ingratitude, in which respect she is made
worse then the most brutish beasts that be, namely, the Ox and the Ass: for
the Ox knows his Owner, and the Ass his Masters crib, but my people (says
God) has not understood: what understood they not? namely who bestowed on them
the good things which they enjoyed. The truth is, that most men are like swine,
Simile.
which eat the fruit that falls from the tree, but look not up to the tree
from whence it falls. Many who daily taste of the sweetness of Gods blessings,
never lift up their hearts to the Author of them. An impious thing to attribute
Gods blessings to fortune.
They think it is a good fortune, a good hap or chance that they have what
they have. This is an heathenish conceit, very unbeseeming Christians, yea, an
impious and sacrilegious conceit, derogatory to the honor of God. What a shame
is it then for Christians to nourish it in their hearts, and profess it with
their mouths. For our parts let us duly consider that all good things are by
Gods providence bestowed on us, that so our hearts may be raised up to him, and
we moved to be the more thankful.

The second is, 2 Take particular notice of Gods blessings.
that we take distinct notice of Gods blessings, and in particular acknowledge
them, and accordingly give thanks for them unto the Lord. (Read for this
purpose, Psalm. 103, and 105, and 106.) Particular notice of distinct blessings
makes us the better prize them, and so inlargeth our hearts the more to praise
God for them. A general Thanksgiving, is for the most part a cold
thanksgiving. What life is there in this form, God be thanked for all, when
nothing at all is acknowledged: yet is this general form of Thanksgiving all
the thanksgiving which many yield unto the Lord.

The third is, 3 Accept Gods blessings as tokens of his favor.
that we accept Gods blessings as tokens of his love and favor, and
accordingly rejoice in them. David observed the kindness of the Lord in the
blessings which God bestowed on him, and thereupon says unto God; Psalm. 138. 2.
I will praise thy name, because of thy kindness. Where no sweetness of Gods
blessings is tasted, there can no sound thanks be rendered. Now unless we be
persuaded that God in Love bestows his blessings on us, what sweet relish
can they give unto us? If we feared that Gods blessings were like hot coals
heaped on our heads, given in wrath (as a King was given to Israel) little
devotion could we have to thank God for them: Ose. 13. 11.
nothing more stirs up gratefulness then a persuasion of kindness.

The fourth is, 4 Observe what we have received above others.
that we observe what God has bestowed on us above others, and what others
want that we have: Thus did David amplify Gods mercies showed to Israel,
saying; Psalm. 147. 19, 20.
He has not dealt so with every nation, neither have they knowledge of his
judgments. Thus do Gods children in their forms of thanksgiving use also to
amplify Gods blessings, saying unto him; Such and such favors have thou
bestowed on us, which many more worthy the^ we have wanted. Wherefore let us
not so much consider what others have more then we, (for that will but make us
murmur and repine against God, and envy our brethren) as what we have more
then other: this will make us truly thankful.

The fifth is, 5 Consider our unworthiness of the least blessing.
that we duly weigh how unworthy we are of the very least of Gods favors, even
of the least crum of bread which we eat, and of the least drop of drink
which we take. Genesis 32. 10.
Thus did Jacob, saying to God; I am no^ worthy of the least of thy mercies,
etc. Who will give thanks for that which he thinks of due belongs unto

. 74. Of mental Prayer.
HItherto have we heard of the distinct kinds of prayer in respect of the
matter. What be the kinds of prayer in regard of the manner
There are other distinctions in regard of the manner, as 1 Mental, Vocal. 2
Sudden, composed. 3 Conceived, prescribed. 4 Public, Private. 5 Ordinary,
extraordinary.


1 Mental prayer is an inward opening of the desire of a man's heart to God,
Mental prayer.
without any outward manifestation of the same by word. Such a prayer was that
which Neh. 2. 4.
Nehemiah made to the God of heaven, even when he was talking with the King:
and Exo. 14. 15.
Moses when he was encouraging the people: and 1 Samuel 1, 13.
Annah who is said to speak in her heart.

This may be as fervent as if it were uttered. For in regard of the ardency of
Moses mental prayer, God says, Why criest thou unto me? And Annah says, She
powered out her soul before the Lord. This oftentimes causes the eyes and
hands to be lift up, or cast down, and forces such outward signs.

This is used because God is a searcher of the hearts, Reason.
and knows the secrets thereof, and needs not words to have a man's thoughts
made known to him, as we showed. 4. and 6. Use.
before.

By this we see that nothing can hinder prayer: but that in company, in the
midst of businesses, when we are overwhelmed with temptations, we may pray
unto God: here learn to do it.

. 75. Of vocal prayer.
2 Vocal prayer is that which is uttered with words, 2 Vocal prayer.
as 1 King. 8. 23.
that prayer which Solomon made at the dedication of the Temple.

Quest. Seeing God knows the secrets of the heart, what need words to
express the meaning thereof?

Answ. Reasons Why prayer is to be uttered with words.
First because of Gods ordinance, as was showed. 6.
before?

Secondly, that men might know the desires of one another heart, and so
partake of the mutual prayers one of another: as in public assemblies, in
private families, and when friends meet together for that end. For words do
most lively and plainly set forth the desire of a man's heart, and men can best
and most distinctly understand them.

3 Because words do not only declare, but also stir up and increase the
affection of the heart. For as fire heateth a chimney, and the reflection of
heat which comes from the chimney makes the fire hotter, so the ardency of
the heart provoke words, and words make the heart more ardent and earnest.

4 Words are an especial means to keep the mind in prayer from wandering,
and to hold it close to the matter. A man that prays alone, and that only in
his inward meditation, will often have his meditations interrupted with other
thoughts, and so his prayer stand at a stay, till after some time his former
meditations come to his mind again. Now the uttering of words will be a good
means to prevent that interruption.

5 The tongue wherewith words are uttered, is of all other parts of a man's body
the most proper and excellent instrument of Gods glore. James 3. 9.
Therewith especially bless we God, and therefore by an excellency it is
called glory. As David speaking of his tongue says, Psalm. 16. 9.
My glory rejoices. And again, and 57. 8.
Awake my glory. And again, and 108. 1.
I will sing and give praise with my glory. In regard of these three last
reasons, it is meet to use words even in private prayers when we are alone:
Provided that it be not for ostentation to be known to pray, for that is a note
of hypocrisy Mat. 6. 5.
condemned by our Lord in the Scribes and Pharisees.

. 76. Of sudden prayer.
SVdden prayer is when upon some present occasion the heart is instantly lift
up unto God, 3 Sudden. prayer.
whether it be only by some sighs of the heart, or by some few words uttered.
It is likely that Neh. 2, ^
Nehemiahs prayer was some sudden desire of the heart. For the King offering
speech unto him, gave him occasion to make a suit unto the King, which that he
might obtain, he presently lift up his heart to God.

These sudden prayers are called ciaculations of the heart, Simile.
which are to be used as salt with meat: with every bit of meat we commonly
take a little salt to season it. So when we do any thing, when we confer of
any thing, when we go any whether, upon all occasions we must lift up our
hearts to God.

This argues an holy familiarity with God, Reason.
yea it manifests an heavenly mind, even as those things which are ready upon
all occasions to fly upward appear to be of a light aerial or fiery nature,
Simile.
not earthly, heavy, and weighty.

This kind of prayer must so be used, as it be added to solemn and set
prayers, and not make them to be neglected. No man makes a meal of salt
alone, and refuses other solid meat, because salt is now and then to be eaten.
Much less must these sudden prayers hinder solemn or composed prayers.

. 77. Of composed prayer.
COmposed prayer is when a Christian sets himself to make some solemn
prayer unto God, 4 Composed prayer.
whether it be in Church, family, closet, field, or any other place; whether it
be uttered with words, or only conceived in heart: as the morning and evening
prayer which Christians use to make, or the prayer at solemn assemblies, with
the like. Dan. 6. 10.
Such were the prayers that Daniel used to make three times a day.

God to whom we make our prayer is a great God, Reasons.
of excellent Majesty, not lightly, but with all due reverence to be regarded,
and therefore most meet that we should compose our selves in a solemn manner
to appear before his glorious presence.

. 78. Of preparation before prayer.
THat this kind of prayer may be the better performed, Preparation needful.
preparation is very needful, which the Preacher implies saying, Eccle. 5. 2.
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any
thing before God.

In preparation unto prayer two things are to be performed. First we must
empty our fowls of al such things as may hinder prayer. Secondly fill them
with such things as may be helpful thereunto.

The things that hinder are either wicked or worldly.

Wicked things are against God, or against man.

Against God are all sins, Hindrances of prayer.
and transgressions of his Law. These we must search out, and having found them
out, set our selves with a full and honest purpose of heart utterly to forsake
them. Psalm. 66. 18.
If we regard wickedness, God will not hear our prayer. Whereupon says and 26.
6.
David I will wash mine hands in inocency, O Lord, and compass thine alter.

Against man are wrath, anger, malice, and such like reuengeful affections, in
regard whereof the Apostle exhorts to 1 Timothy 28.
lift up pure hands without wrath. And Mat. 5. 24.
Christ commanded to be reconciled before the gift be offered. In a word then,
that we may empty our souls of al such wicked things both against God and man,
which would hinder our prayers, these two things are needful* First repentance
toward God: secondly, reconciliation with man.

Worldly things are such cares, as concern the things of this life: our
temporal estate, and earthly affairs, which though at other times they may be
warantable, commendable, and needful, yet may be an incumberance and
hinderance unto prayer. This was prefigured under the Law* by that rite Exo. 3,
5. Josh, 5. 15.
of plucking off shoes when men appeared before the Lord. Shoes are lawful
to be worn, yea very needful, yet in approaching before the Lord they must be
put off. So moderate care concerning the business and affairs of this world
are lawful and needful, yet when we go to prayer, they must be laid aside,
and our souls emptied of them. For they are as heavy burdens, and clogs which
will hold down our hearts, and keep them from flying up into heaven. Now note
the counsel of the Apostle, Heb. 12. 1. Helps to prayer.
Cast away every thing that presses down.

If our souls be only emptied of these things, they are like that Mat. 12.
44. 45.
empty house which the unclean spirit finding, enters into with seven other
spirits. Wherefore that we may be prepared to prayer, we must be filled with
such spiritual matters as fit prayer: which are concerning God and our selves.
Gods greatness is to be meditated of, to strike our hearts with reverence: and
his goodness to breed faith in us. Yea also his blessings bestowed to fill our
mouths with praise. Our wretchedness is duly to be weighed, that we may be
truly humbled: and our wants are to be observed, that we may know what to
ask. Thus are we to come prepared to composed prayer.

79. Of conceived prayer.
Conceived prayer is that which he who utters the prayer inuenteth and
conceiueth himself, Conceived prayer.
as are most of the prayers recorded in the Scripture. This kind of prayer the
Saints in all ages have used, It is very commendable, expedient, and needful*
For,

1 It manifests the gift and power of the Spirit, Reasons.
who can give both matter and manner, words and affections: who can suggest
what to pray, and how to pray.

2 Every day we have new wants, new assaults, new sins: Is it not needful
then that our prayers be conceived and framed accordingly, that our petitions
be made according to our present wants, our supplications according to our
particular assaults, our confession according to our several sins?

3 As God daily continues and renews old blessings, so also he adds new
to them. Is it not most meet that notice be taken of those new blessings, and
accordingly thanks be given in particular for them?

Object. This present inuenting and conceiving of prayer, makes prayer to be
confused, and either very defective, or very tedious.

Answ. In them that have not ability to pray, or suddenly and rashly come unto
prayer, it may be so. But if a man have any competent ability, if he
premeditate before hand what to pray, if he set unto himself any good method
and order, such defect, tediousness, and confusion (as is supposed) will be
easily avoided.

. 80. Of prescribed prayer.
PRescribed prayer is, 6 Prescribed prayer.
when a set, constant form is laid down before hand, and either conned by
heart, or read out of a book or paper by him that utters it, and that
whether he be alone, or in company.

Quest. Is a set and prescribed form of prayer lawful?

Answ. Reasons.
Yea verily, and that for these reasons:

1 Number. 23. 24.
God prescribed a set form of blessing for the Priests constantly to use. The
92. Psalm, which is a Psalm of praise, was prescribed a song for the Sabbath
day: and 102. Psalm prescribes a prayer for the afflicted when he is
overwhelmed, and powers out his complaint before the Lord. 2 Chr. 20. 21.
The 136. Psalm was sung after David's time. and 29. 30.
Hezekiah the King, and the Princes commanded the Levites to praise the Lord
with the words of David, and of Asaph the Seer. If a prescribed form of praise
may be used, then also of prayer: for there is the same reason of both.

Besides, Christ himself prescribed an excellent form of prayer which has
been used in all ages of the Church since this time, and is by an excellency
called the Lords Prayer. Saint Paul observes a set form of blessing in the
beginning and end of his Epistles. Thus we see prescribed prayer warranted by
Gods word.

2 Many weak ones who have good affections, but want invention, utterance, and
such like parts, are much helped by prescribed forms: for when they read or
hear words fitting their wants and occasions, their hearts can well go with
their words, yet can they not invent fit words.

3 Prescribed forms of prayer in the public worship is a good means to
maintain uniformity in several Churches.

Object. The spirit is stinted hereby: neither can a man utter that which the
spirit moves him unto, when he has a set form prescribed.

Answ. The spirit in him which prays by a set form, is no more stinted, then
the spirit is stinted in those which hear another pray: for to them which
hear others, words are prescribed. To the hearers it is all one whether he
that prays uses a prescribed form, or conceive, and invent his prayer, for
they go along in their hearts with his words.

They who simply and altogether condemn prescribed prayer, do think too
childishly of God, and deal too injuriously with Gods little ones. They
conceit God to be affected with variety, and make the power of prayer to
consist in copy of words, and nouelty of matter, which is many times an
hinderance to true devotion: for while the mind is too much occupied in
invention, the heart cannot be so free to devotion, as otherwise it might be.
Prayer is not like a nose-gay, which is no longer sweet then the flowers are
new and fresh: For the sweet savor of prayer consists in the sincerity of
heart, and ardency of affection, whereby also the power of the spirit is
manifested.

2 The injury which is done to Gods little ones is this, that they seek to
deprive them of an especial help, whereby their weakness might be supported,
yea to hinder them of the benifit of prayer. For many are not able to conceive
a prayer of themselves, yet if they find a form answerable to their
occasions, they can pray heartily and earnestly.

Thus we see that prescribed prayer is not only lawful, but also needful. So
far forth as we find it an help to devotion, we may use it: but yet we may
not always tie our selves unto it: to say the least, they are very weak
Christians that cannot pray without a prescribed form.

Now it is a shame for any Christian to be a weak one all the days of his
life: it is required at our hands to grow in knowledge, judgment, discretion,
faith, and other like graces.

. 81. Direction to conceive a Prayer.
IF the weakest Christians do but carefully observe the order that others use,
and withal take notice of their own sins in particular, of their particular
wants, and of the particular blessings which God bestows on them, they may
with use and practice come to conceive a good Prayer. And when once in any
competent measure they can pray for themselves, by degrees they come to pray
for others also. But many are too idle and sluggish in making trial: they will
not offer to make experience of the gift of Gods Spirit: but rather utterly
quench it; as a man may do, and too many so do, by tying themselves too much
to set forms.

Though public leiturgies for uniformity sake are to be constantly used in set
forms (provided that there be several prayers fit for diverse, yea, for all
public occasions so near as may be) yet it is not so meet for particular
persons always to tie themselves to one set form. For what can that argue but
that they little observe Gods different manner of dealing with them at several
times.

. 82. Of public Prayer, and of the Ministers function therein.
PVblike Prayer is when an assembly of Saints publicly with one joint consent
call upon God. 7 Public Prayer.


In public prayer, three things are requisite.

1 Meet persons.

2 A fit place.

3 A right manner.

1 The Persons must be a public Minister of the Word and People. 1 The
persons who make public prayer.
I showed before that Prayer was a principal part of Gods public worship. Now
in all public worship there is required a Minister for one party, and People
for the other. A Minister has a double function; one to stand in Gods room,
and in Gods name to declare Gods mind and will unto his people. Another to
stand in the Peoples room, and in their name to declare their mind and desire
to God.

The former he does in preaching the Word and administering the Sacraments. For
God (says the Apostle) 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.
Has committed to us the word of reconciliation: now then are we Ambassadors
for Christ, etc. Expressly it is said, that Ministers are Christ's Ambassadors,
which is in regard of the Word that also they are such in regard of the
Sacraments, is implied in that commission given to the Apostles, Mat. 28. 19
Go teach all Nations, and baptize them in the name of the Father, etc.

The latter he does in making Petitions and giving thanks to God: Joel 2. 16,
17
When the Prophet had exhorted the people to assemble together publicly to
pray: he says; Let the Priests, the Ministers of the Lord say, spare thy
people O Lord, and give not thine heritage into reproach, etc. Ministers
therefore in public Assemblies are to utter the petitions of people: so it is
noted that Neh. 8. 1. 6
when the people were assembled to give thanks to God, Ezra the Priest praised
the Lord. Exodus 30. 7
The incense which under the Law was offered by the Priest to God, did
prefigure thus much.

Thus as in preaching a Minister is Gods mouth to the people, so in praying,
the peoples mouth to God. Wherefore also there must be people to join with
him: for if a Minister be alone, his Prayer is but a private Prayer.

. 83. Of the Peoples consent in public Prayer.
THat which is required of people in public Prayer, is to testify their
consent to that which the Minister utters: for the prayer of the Minister is
their prayer: though for order sake to avoid confusion there be but one voice
uttered, yet the hearts of all present must go along with that voice and give
an inward assent, and not so only, but also it is very expedient to testify
the same, so as the Minister may hear their consent, as well as they hear his
prayer.

The ordinary way, Amen, is originally an Hebrew word, yet used in all
languages: it signifies Truth or Faith: the uttering of it, after a Prayer, in
plieth an assent unto the Prayer, and faith for obtaining that which is prayed
for.
and the best way for people to manifest their consent, is with a distinct and
audible voice to say Amen. Thus the people were commanded to say Amen. Deuteronomy.
27. 15. etc. And accordingly was it practiced. Nehe. 8. 6. It is a sound well
beseeming Gods public worship, to make the place ring again (as we speak)
with a joint Amen of the people. Ad similitudinem caelectis tonitrui, Amen
reboat. Hier. proaem. in 2. lib. comment. ad Gal.
The Jews uttered this word with great ardency, and therefore used to double
it, saying, Amen, Amen. Neh. 8. 6.

. 84. Of the place of public Prayer.
2 THe place must be public: 2 The place of public Prayer. Genesis 4. 26.
such a place as all that ought to meet may know, and have liberty to come
unto: at first this was in some Family, yea, afterward when all the world
almost forsook God, God chose out of the world some peculiar families, who
with their household worshipped God in their houses; as Noah in his time, so
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, in their times. But when Gods people increased in the
wilderness, he caused a Tabernacle to be built; that then was their place of
public worship, afterward a Temple was built, which because it was the place
of public worship, was by a propriety called, Isa. 56. 7.
The house of Prayer. To this place if the people could not come, Dan. 6. 10.
they would at least pray toward it: for which they had their warrant from 1
Kin. 8. 44.
Salomons prayer.

After that Christ came, by whom the partition wall betwixt Jews and Gentiles
was broken down, and both made one people to God, 1 Timothy 2. 8.
all places were sanctified for Prayer: in which respect Christ said; Ioh. 4.
21.
The hour comes when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem
worship the Father. So as under the Gospel no one place is more holy then
another. Yet it being Gods will to be worshipped publicly, needful it is
that there should be places fit for that purpose. Thus 1 Cor. 11. 20
the Corinthians had one place to worship God in.

In Kingdoms and Nations where Gods worship is maintained, are Churches, and
Chapels built for that purpose. These being set apart for Gods public
worship, Ministers and people are to resort unto them.

Yet I deny not but in times of persecution, secret and unknown places
(secret I say, and unknown to haters and persecutors of Religion, but known
to true professors) may be used for public prayer: Acts 16. 13.
as certain Inhabitants of Philippi went out to a Rivers side to pray on the
Sabbath day. Separatists taxed.
Separatists which live in this Land, and other like places, where are public
places for prayer appointed, whereunto all have liberty to resort, commit a
double fault: one in abstaining from such public places, whereby they show
themselves contemners of public Prayer: the other, that they seek private
places, as houses, woods, and boats, for public prayer: whereby (to say the
least) they turn Gods public worship into a private worship. Too near to
these do many Schismatikes come, who though they frequent our Churches to
hear the Word preached, yet will they not be present in time of public
prayer, whereby they deprive God of one part, and that the most principal part
of his public worship.

. 85. Of unanimity in public prayer.
3 FOr the manner of public prayer, 3 The manner of public prayer.
two things are requisite Unanimity. Uniformity.


Unanimity respects the heart and affections, 1 Unanimity.
that all which assemble together, may continue in the Church (as is noted of
the Christians in the Primitive Church) Acts 2. 46.
with one accord. For this end in public worship a voice is necessary: for
how can there be a consent of heart, unless one know another mind? how can
that be known but by the voice? it is the principal end of speech, to make
known a man's mind. A voice used in public prayer must be Audible.
Intelligible.


. 86. Of uttering public prayer with an audible voice.
1 IT must be so loud as all that are present (if it be possible) may hear
it. The Ministers voice must be audible.
For a voice not heard is as no voice to them which hear it not: they can give
no assent, and so pray not: it is noted that 1. King. 8. 55
Solomon Blessed all the congregation with a loud voice.

It is a fault for a Minister in the Church to pray so softly, as all the
people cannot hear him: some that are able to utter a loud voice, and that
preach loud enough, in prayer cannot be heard: is there not as much reason that
people should hear their Minister pray, as preach? other that are loud enough,
in the middle and ending of their prayer, cannot be heard in the beginning: but
every word ought so to be uttered, as it may be heard. It is a fault also in
people so to say Amen, Amen to be uttered aloud.
as they cannot be heard: why should not the Minister as well hear the assent
of his people, as they hear his prayer? it cannot but slacken the ardencie of
a Ministers affection, when he cannot perceive any consent in people to that
which he prays: but a cheerful and evident assent does quicken and cheer
up his spirit.

. 87. Of praying in a known tongue.
2 IT must be such a kind of voice, The Ministers voice must be intelligible.
and so uttered, as all that hear it may understand it: for so says the
Apostle, speaking of public prayer, 1. Cor. 14. 15
I will pray with understanding, that is, so as others may understand me.
Otherwise a loud voice is no benefit at all. If a trumpet should be sounded,
and the sound not discerned, 1. Cor. 14. 8.
who shall prepare himself to battle thereby? That a man's voice may be
intelligible, his language wherein he speaks must be known, and his speech
distinct.

. 88. Of the aberrations contrary to praying with understanding.
IT is utterly unlawful to pray in a strange tongue: Unlawful to pray in a
strange tongue.
1. Cor. 14. 6. etc.
a thing against which the Apostle purposely and copiously disputes. To omit
many other arguments, which might be alleged against prayer in an unknown
tongue, let this one be noted, that an unknown tongue depriueth a man of the
sense of Gods favor in hearing his prayer. For how can he, who knows not
what he has asked, know when his petition is granted. Prayer in a known
tongue has respect both to the party that utters the prayer (he must
understand what he utters, or else his prayer is but a lippe-labour, even
mere babbling, which Matthew. 6. 7.
Christ condemns) and also to them who hear it, their hearing if they
understand not, 1. Cor. 14. 17, 23.
is no hearing, they cannot be edified thereby.

Papists offend in both these.

1 They teach children, women, laymen, such as understand not one word of
Latin, to make all their prayers in Latin.

2 They prescribe their public prayers, whereof all the people partake, to be
made in Latin.

To affect in prayer such uncouth words, 2 To use curious phrases in prayer.
and curious phrases as exceed the capacity of the unlearned, is little better
then to pray in a strange tongue. 1. Cor. 4. 16.
The Apostle shows that prayers must be so uttered, as the unlearned may say
Amen.

Contrary to distinct praying, 3 To tumble over a prayer too fast.
it is for a Minister to mumble and tumble over his words too fast: it argues
want of reverence, it hinders devotion and affection of heart (for when a
prayer is too fast posted over, what time can there be for the heart to work)
it also hinders attention, and understanding in the hearer.

. 90. Of uniformity in public prayer.
Uniformity respects the outward carriage and gesture in prayer. Of reverend
and humble gesture I spoke. 11.
before. The point now to be noted is, that al which assemble together in one
place to pray, do use one and the same seemly gesture, Neh. 8. 5.
which is noted of the people in Ezraes time, when he opened the book to
read, all stood up, verse. 6.
and when he praised the Lord, they al bowed themselves, etc. This outward
uniformity preuenteth a preposterous censuring of one another, and may be a
means of stirring up one another affections: for when one sees others humbly
to kneel down, his heart may be so struck, as he will be moved with reverence to
humble his own soul: but diversity of gestures may cause distractions, and
hinder devotions: uniformity in that which is lawful and warrantable is an
especial part of good order: diversity of gestures causes a kind of
confusion. Now 1. Cor. 14. 33
God is not the author of confusion: wherefore Verse. 40.
all things are to be done decently and in good order. The best general rule
that we can observe to keep order, is, to yield to such commendable, and
warrantable gestures as the Church wherein we live prescribes and practices.

. 91. Of motives to public prayer.
THus having given some directions for public prayer, Motives to public
prayer.
I will lay down some motives to stir us with conscience to perform it.

1 The more public prayer is, 1 It is more honorable and acceptable.
the more honorable and acceptable it is to God. If it be an honor to God for
one to pray, the more do join together therein, the more honorable it must
needs be: it is the more acceptable, because God delights in the joint consent
of his Saints worshipping him: whereupon God promised, Mat. 18 20.
Where two or three were gathered together in his name, to be in the midst of
them.

2 It is also the more powerful: 2 It is more powerful.
the cries of many joined together make a loud cry in Gods ears, and move
him the sooner to open his ears. Hereupon when there was a judgment in the
Land, Joel. 2. 16, 17
the Prophet calls all the people to assemble together to pray: and so did
John 3. 8.
the King of Nineveh, when the ruin thereof was threatened.

3 It is an outward sign whereby we manifest our selves to be of the chosen
and called flock of Christ. 3 It is a sign of communion.


4 It is an especial means of mutual edification: for thereby we mutually
stir up the zeal, 4 It is a means of edification.
and inflame the affection of one another.

5 The neglect of it is a note of profaneness, from which blame Separatists,
5 The neglect of it, is a note of profaneness.
and Schismatiques though they would seem very religious, cannot well acquit
themselues^

These and such other like reasons made Psalm. 122. 1^
David rejoice when he said, We will go into the house of the Lord; and mourn
when he could not come into the house of Prayer. and 84. 1. etc.


. 92. Of private Prayer.
Private prayer is that which is made by some few together, Private prayer.
or by one alone: by few, as when two or three friends go together into some
secret place (as 2. King. 4. 33
when Elisha and his servant were alone in a chamber praying for the Shunamites
child, and Luke 9. 28.
Christ took Peter, and John, and James, and went into a mountain to pray) or
an whole household pray together in the family, as Acts 10. 30.
when Cornelius prayed in his house. This charge especially belongs to the
master of the family. For as he is in his family a Lord to govern, and a
Prophet to teach, so also a Priest to offer up the sacrifice of prayer: as a
Minister in the Church, so he in the house must utter the prayer (or at least
provide one to perform that duty) and withal, cause his whole household to be
present thereat.

. 93. Of prayer in a family.
1 THe family has need of peculiar blessings, Resons for prayer in a family.
which by prayer are to be sought, besides the public and common blessings
which in the Church are prayed for: 1 The need of it.
yea it receives many blessings, for which peculiar thanks are to be given in
the house.

2 A Christians house is made Gods Church, 2 The honor of it.
if Gods worship (a principal part whereof is prayer) be there from time to
time performed, which is a great honor unto a family. Wherefore, for honors
sake, Saint Paul mentions Romans 16. 5.
the Church in the house of Priscilla and Aquila, and Phil. v. 2.
of Philemon.

3 By prayer a Christian brings Gods blessing into 3 The profit of it.
his house (which is a matter of great profit) for where God is called upon,
there is he present to bestow his blessing, as 2. Sam. 6. 11.
he blessed Obed-edom, and all his household, while the Arc was in his house.
Prayer then brings both honor and profit unto a Family.

Unworthy they are to be governors of a family, Use. Reproof of those who
neglect prayer in their families.
who omit this duty therein. They cause Gods curse to lie upon their house,
and deprive themselves of a just right unto all the goods which are therein.
For by prayer they are all sanctified: he that uses any thing without prayer,
is an usurper and a robber; and shall another day dearly answer for it. They
who frequent public prayer at Church, and neglect private prayer at home, are
either superstitious, or hypocritical persons.

. 94. Of secret Prayer.
THe prayer which is made by one alone, 9 Secret prayer.
none being present but God and he which prays, I may call Secret prayer.
This may be in Mat. 6. 6.
a close chamber, or closet, Mark 1. 35.
or on a desolate mountain, Genesis 24. 63.
or in a secret field, or Act. 10. 9.
on any house top, 1. Tim. 2. 8.
or in any other place.

It is very needful that secret prayer be added both to public prayer at
Church, Reasons for secret prayer.
and private prayer in Family, for these reasons.

1 Hereby we may more freely power out our whole hearts unto God: 1. In it we
may most freely make known our whole mind.
it is not meet that any other person should know many things which are known
to God, and cannot be concealed from him. Every one is guilty of such
particular sins, as are to be acknowledged alone before God, and every one
has particular wants to be prayed for by himself. Hereby also we may by
name mention in our prayers to God our dearest friends, which is not so meet
to do in company. I think Saint Paul meant such Secret prayers, when he said,
Romans 1. 9, 10
I make mention of you always in my prayers.

2 This kind of prayer affords the truest trial of the uprightness of a
man's heart: 2 By it truest trial of our uprightness is made.
for a man may long continue to pray in the Church and in a family, and his
prayer be mere formal, even for company sake: but he that alone in secret,
when and where no other man knows, calls upon God, surely makes conscience
of prayer, and has an honest heart (though he may have much weakness, and
many imperfections) or else he would soon omit his course of praying in
secret. For what byrespect is there that should move him to continue it,
unless he be Popish, and think that the saying of a few prayers in secret
is a meritorious work?

3 This argues a great familiarity with God, 3 It argues familiarity with
God.
when a subject uses to go alone to his Sovereign, it argues much more
familiarity, then when he comes with a petition in the company of others.

4 It brings greatest comfort unto a man's heart: 4 It brings much comfort.
for such is the corruption of our nature, that we cannot perform any holy
exercise as we ought ( Romans 7. 21.
When we would do good, evil is present with us) whereby it comes to pass
that the comfort of such holy exercises, which we perform in Church or house,
is taken away. This makes Christians to run to God in secret, to humble
themselves for the imperfections of their public prayers. Christians would
much doubt, and even faint oftentimes, if it were not for their secret prayers.
They which content themselves with Church and family prayers, have just cause
to suspect themselves.

5 Such wives, 5 By it supply is made in want of other prayers.
children, servants and other inferiors, which live in any house under
profane governors, that will not have prayers in their families, may by this
kind of prayer make supply thereof unto their own souls: none can hinder
secret prayer.

Object. We can have neither time nor place to pray secretly.

Answ. Do ye not find many times and places to commit sin so secretly as
none can see you? if you had as great delight in prayer as in sin, you would
find time and place.

This kind of prayer (so near as may be) is to be performed so secretly,
Direction.
as no other may know it, lest the knowledge which others have of it, may
minister occasion of inward pride, Mat. 6. 6.
Shut the door, says Christ. It is not meet to utter secret prayer so loud
as any other should hear it.

. 95. Of extraordinary prayer.
THe last distinction of prayer, is ordinary and extraordinary. All the
forenamed kinds are ordinary, therefore I shall not need to speak of it.

Extraordinary prayer, 10 Extraordinary prayer.
is that which after an extraordinary manner, even above our usual custom, is
powered out before God This consists partly in ardencie of affection, and
partly in continuance of time. Ioh. 3. 8.
The King of Nineveh required an extraordinary ardencie, when he commanded his
people to cry mightily unto God. We have a memorable example hereof in Moses,
who was so earnest in his prayer, that Exodus 32. 32.
rather then not have his petition granted, he desired to be rased out of Gods
Book. Christ's ardencie yet exceeded this; it is noted that he prayed Luke 22.
44.
earnestly, Heb. 5. 7. (...).
with strong crying and tears. Yea his ardency made his sweat to be as great
drops of blood falling down to the ground.

This ardencie is in Scripture set forth by diverse Metaphors, as Joel. 2. 13.
renting the heart, Exodus 14. 15
crying, Romans 15. 30.
striving, Genesis 32. 24
wrestling with God, etc.

Though this ardency be an inward work, yet can it hardly contain it self
within a man: but as thunder, which is an heat conceived within a cloud,
because of the ardency of that inward heat bursteth forth, and causes
lightning, rumbling, and rain; so a vehement and earnest desire of the heart
will some way or other manifest and declare it self. Many ways are noted in
the Scripture, whereby it has been manifested.

. 96. Of the signs of extraordinary ardency.
1 EXtraordinary distemper of the body. Luke 22. 44
Christ's earnestness in prayer stroke him into an agony, and caused his sweat
to be turned into blood. Neh. 2. 2
Nehemiahs ardency so changed his countenance, as the King observed it.

2 Unusual motion of the parts of a man's body: 1 Samuel 1. 13
Annah so moved her lips, as Eli thought she had been drunken. 1 King 8. 22
Solomon spread his arms abroad. Luke 18. 13
The Publican beat his breast. Mar. 14. 35
Christ fell upon the ground.

3 Deep sighs and groans. Psalm. 38. 9
My sighing is not hid from thee, says David to God. Romans 8 26
The sighs of the spirit are such as cannot be expressed.

4 Loud crying. Psalm. 32. 3
David roared all the day. Mat. 27. 46 (...)
Christ cried with a loud voice.

5 Often repeating and inculcating the same Petition. Mat. 26. 39, 42, 44
Christ did once, twice, thrice, return to God in prayer, saying the same
words. 2 Cor. 12. 8
Paul prayed thrice, that is, often, against a temptation. Note how Dan. 9. 18, 19
Daniel doubleth and redoubleth his words, O my God, incline thine ears and
hear, open thine eyes and behold, etc. O Lord hear; O Lord forgive, O Lord
consider, and do it. Defer not, etc. Genesis 18. 24.
Abram prayed six several times together for one thing, namely, for mercy on
Sodom.

6 Tears, Heb. 5. 7
these Christ powered forth. Luke. 7. 38
So did the sinful woman, and 1 Samuel 7. 6
the Israelites in such abundant measure, that she washed Christ's feet with
her tears, they are said to draw water, and power it out before the Lord; Mat.
26. 75
Peter is said to weep bitterly.

. 97. Of tears in Prayer.
Tears are the most usual signs of earnest and ardent Prayer, in which
respect they are powerful with God. Ose. 1. 2. 4
Jacob had power over the Angel, and prevailed; for why? He wept, and prayed.
Heb. 5. 7
Christ was heard in that which be feared. For why? He also offered up prayers
with tears. Isa. 38. 3
Hezekiah wept sore, and was heard. Peter's tears, the sinful woman's tears,
Annahs tears, the tears of Gods children at all times have been regarded,
and accepted. Yea, it is noted that God Psalm. 56. 8
has a bottle wherein he puts the tears of his Saints: and with great
Emphasis says David, Are they not in thy Book? there recorded to be remembered?

Object. Esaus Heb. 12. 17.
tears were no whit regarded, Iud. 20. 23.
nor the tears of the Israelites when they went to fight against Benjamin, no
nor 2 Samuel 12. 22
David's tears when he prayed, fasted, and wept for his child.

Answ. 1 Tears simply in themselves are no whit acceptable unto God, but as
they are signs of true prayer. Esaus tears were not such, they rose from
grief of a worldly loss, and from anger, malice, and indignation against his
brother.

Secondly, If any continue in sin, and repent not, their tears are not
regarded. The Israelites had not repented of their own sins, and yet would
take vengeance of their brothers sin: they wept because they prevailed not,
but they wept not because they repented not of their own sins. Afterward
when in token of their repentance, they fasted, and offered burnt offerings,
and peace offerings unto the Lord, Judge. 20. 26
and so wept, the Lord heard them, and they prevailed against Benjamin.

3 Though God grant not that particular which by tears is craved, yet may the
tears be acceptable to the Lord, as David's were:

Then are tears most powerful and effectual, When tears are effectual.
when they arise from compunction of heart for sin committed against God, as
the tears of the sinful woman, and of Peter. Nothing more moves the true
Christian heart to melt, and eyes to flow forth with tears, then a due
consideration of Gods tender and merciful dealing with man, and his
ungrateful, and ungracious carriage toward God. The fear of Gods wrath, and
judgments, and horror of hell, may strike the heart with astonishment, and
amazement, and make it as Nabals heart, like a stone. But grief for
displeasing a merciful Father, 1 Samuel 25. 37.
and sorrow for loss of Gods favor, is it which especially makes the ^eart
send forth, and the eyes shed tears.

. 98. Of extraordinary continuance in Prayer.
EXtraordinary Prayer further consists in long continuance, when prayer is
held out longer then at usual and accustomed times. Genesis 32. 24
Jacob continued a whole night ^n prayer: 2 Samuel 12. 16
so did David, and Luke 6. 12
Christ. Exodus 17. 12
Moses spent a day ^herein: so did ^osh. 7. 6
Ioshuah and the Elders of Israel. Psalm. 22. 2
David ^alled upon God night and day. No doubt but Jonah lon. 2. 1
spent ^he three days and three nights that he was in the Whales ^elly in
prayer. 12. Expounded.
Dan. 10. 2, 3
It may be gathered that Daniel continued one and twenty days in prayer. (Not
that without any intermission he so long prayed, but that every day in that
time he returned to extraordinary prayer:) for so long he was in heaviness,
and eat no pleasant bread. (Now fasting and sorrow in the Saints are
companions of prayer,) besides the Angel of God came to him at the end of
those three weeks (when his extraordinary prayers are to be supposed to end)
and said to him; From the first day that thou did set thine heart to
understand, and to humble thy self before thy God, thy words were heard. Here
he shows that with Daniels humiliation prayer was joined, else how could his
words be heard. Secondly, that there were diverse days spent therein, else he
would not say from the first day, etc. Now that first day being the beginning
of the three weeks, and the Angel coming at the end of the three weeks, it
is like he continued his extraordinary prayers so long. Psalm. 69. 3.
David indefinitely says, that he cried till he was weary, till his throat
was dry, till his eyes failed.

For extraordinary continuance, Intentio sicut non est obtundenda si perdurare
non potest, ita si perdurauerit, non cito est rumpenda. Aug. Epist. 121
he which prays must consider his own strength and ability, and not
endeavor to go beyond that, for this is to prefer sacrifice before mercy,
Mat. 12 7.
which is against Gods will.

Never must this branch of extraordinary prayer be severed from the other, I
mean continuance in time from feruency in heart. For though prayer may be
extraordinarily fervent, when it is not long continued, as Luke 22. 24
Christ's prayer, yet ought not prayer long to continue, except it be hearty and
fervent; for then will it be no better then that Mat. 6. 7, etc. (...).
much babbling, and p those long prayers which Christ reproves.

Thus having in general showed what is extraordinary prayer; for our better
direction therein, and stirring up thereunto, I will further declare: First,
the occasions thereof. Secondly, helps. Thirdly, motives thereunto.

. 99. Of the occasions of extraordinary prayer.
THe occaseons must be extraordinary, Occasions of extraordinary prayer are, 1
Blessings withheld.
and they may be drawn to two heads, Blessings. Judgments.
For blessings, if they be withheld, extraordinary prayer must be used to
obtain them ( 1. Sam. 1. 11.
thus Annah obtained a son) if they be withdrawn and taken away, to recover
them again ( Psalm. 51. 12.
thus had David the joy of his salvation restored to him) In these two examples
we see both temporal and spiritual blessings, to be occasions of
extraordinary prayer. Besides, when we enterprise any thing that requires an
extraordinary blessing, extraornary prayer is to be used. 2 Public worship.
As when we prepare our selves to sanctify the Sabbath, to partake of the holy
Communion, or to have our child baptized: 3 Weighty affairs.
Likewise when we marry, enter into any weighty calling, or office,
especially when Ministers are ordained, or first set over us. Christ prayed
extraordinarily, when he chose his Apostles ( Luke 6. 12. 13.) so did the
Church when it sent forth Paul and Barnabas ( Acts 13. 3.) And when they
ordained Elders, ( Acts 14. 2.)

Judgments are either sins, 4 Temptations to sin.
or punishments of sins. In regard of sins, extraordinary prayer is to be
made, either to free us from temptations thereunto, (as Romans 7. 24.
Paul prayed with great ardencie, saying, O wretched man that I am, who shall
deliver me from the body of this death: 2. Cor. 12. 8.
and again, he prayed thrice against a temptation: yea Mat. 26. 41.
Christ expressly commands his Disciples to watch and pray that they enter not
into temptation) or to pardon such sins as have been committed, 5 Burden of
sin.
and lie heavy upon our conscience, because they are in their kind notorious,
or we have long continued in them, (this Psalm. 51. 1. etc.
moved David very earnestly to pray, as also Mat. 26. 75.
Peter, and 2 Chr. 33. 13
Manasseth.

Punishments of sin are either threatened, 6 Punishments for sin.
or inflicted. They may by extraordinary prayer be prevented, ( as Ion. 3. 9
the destruction of Nineveh, threatened by Jonah was,) These may be removed (as
2 Chr. 33. 12
Manasses captivity was.)

As ordinary prayer is to be made for others, 7 Others need.
as well as for our selves; so likewise extraordinary prayer is to be made for
others, as just occasion is offered. Exodus 32. 31, 32.
Moses his extraordinary prayer was for the sin of the Israelites, and for
Gods judgment threatened against them; so was Ezra 9. 1, etc.
Ezraes prayer.

. 100. Of the sundry kinds of Fasts.
THe helps affoorded to extraordinary prayer are especially two, Fasting an
help to extraordinary prayer.
Fasting. Vowing.


To Fast according to the notation of the (...).
Greek words, signifies to abstain from food. In this general and large
acceptance, a Fast is diversely taken. For there is a physical, politic,
enforced moral, spiritual, extraordinary, hypocritical, supersticious,
heretical, and religious fast.

1 A physical fast, 1 The sick man's fast.
is when for health sake a man forbeareth food. In many cases Physicians give
direction to their Patients to abstain from eating and drinking for a time.

2 A politic fast, 2 The Statemans fast.
is when sometimes of abstaining from food, are enioined for the preservation
of plenty, and prevention of penury.

3 An enforced and necessary Fast, 3 The poor man's fast.
is when men have not sufficient for ordinary meals: as in a City besieged, or
in a ship on Sea far from Land, provision being very scarce, men are forced
to take but one meal a day, or to make every other day a fasting day. Thus
many poor folk are forced often times to fast, because they have nothing to
eat.

4 A moral fast, 4 The sober man's fast.
is when men eat and drink sparingly, not so much as their appetite desires,
but only so much as may preserve nature, and maintain health and strength,
that their wanton and lustful flesh may not be pampered, but rather kept
under: to which purpose tends this exhortation of Christ; Luke 21. 34.
Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be ouercharged with
surfeiting and drunkenness. This is not properly a fast, because something is
taken, but only respectibly, because something is forborne.

5 A spiritual fast, 5 The sanctified man's fast.
is when men abstain from vice, which is as food to their corrupt nature:
Hereof the Lord speaks, Isa. 58. 6.
where he says; Is not this the fast which I have chosen to loose the bonds of
wickedness? This is called a fast only by way of resemblance.

6 A miraculous fast, 6 The extraordinary man's fast.
is when men extraordinarily assisted by the power of God, abstain from all
manner of food longer then the nature of man is able to endure: such were the
fasts of Moses, Eliah, and Christ, Exodus 34. 28 1 Kings 19. 8.
who fasted forty days together. Mat. 4. 2.


7 An hypocritical fast, 7 The hypocrites fast.
is when men without respect to any occasion of fasting, appoint set times
weekly or monthly, or quarterly to fast. Thus the Pharisees ( Mat. 6. 16.
whom Christ taxes of hypocrisy) fasted Luke 18. 12.
twice in a week; and ^lamed Christ because his Disciples fasted not, not
regarding the occasion, as Mat. 9. 15.
Christ notes in his answer to them.

8 A supersticious fast, 8 The superstitious man's fast.
is when men place Religion and ^olinesse in the abstaining from meat, making
the very ^utward act of fasting to be a part of Gods worship: contrary to that
which the Apostle says both of it, and other like outward exercises; 1 Timothy 4.
8
Bodily exercise profits little.

9 An heretical fast, 9 The heretics fast.
is when men making difference betwixt meats for conscience sake, abstain from
one kind, and glut themselves with another kind, and yet count this a fast.
August. de mor. Manich. l. 2. c. 13.
So did the Manichees of old, and so do the Papists at this day. This the
Apostle reckons up among the Doctrine of Devils. 1 Timothy 4. 1. 3


10 A religious fast, 10 The true Christians fast.
is when men seasonably abstain from refreshing their bodies, to make them
fitter for religious duties.

. 101. Of the difference betwixt a religious fast, and other fasts.
THis religious fast, is the fast which is to be used as a^^ help to
extraordinary prayer. I will therefore more fully unfold the description of it,
and declare first ho^ far we must abstain from refreshing the body.

2 What is the seasonable abstinence here meant.

3 What are the religious duties whereunto we ar^ made more fit by fasting.

A religious fast, is in these three points distinguishe^ from all the other
forenamed fasts.

By the first from a moral, spiritual and heretical fas^ For a moral fast,
though it keep a man from pamperin^ and glutting his body, yet it hinders
not a comfortab^ nourishing, and refreshing of it, as a religious fast do^ for
the time of the fast. A spiritual fast is no whit hind^ red by the bodies
sustenance, if it be moderate. As for t^ heretical fast, therein it is
permitted even to glut the b^dy with fish, sweet meats, and such like
delicates, so fle^ be forborne.

By the second, from a miraculous fast, which is not according to the course of
nature seasonable; and from an hypocritical fast, which for the occasion of it
is not seasonable; whereas the religious fast is both for time and occasion (as
we shall 104. 106
after hear) seasonable.

By the third, from a physical, politic, forced, and superstitious fast: all
which have other ends then a religious fast.

Observe those things which more largely and fully shall be delivered in
explication of the three forenamed points concerning a religious Fast, and
compare them with the descriptions of other Fasts, and the said differences
betwixt a religious Fast, and other Fasts will be easily discerned.

. 102. Of forbearing to eat and drink in the time of a Fast.
Under this phrase of cherishing the Body, I. Point. How far we must abstain
from refreshing the body in a Fast.
is eating and drinking especially meant: for thereby is the body more then by
any other thing nourished and refreshed; nothing so absolutely necessary
thereto as food. Besides, the general nature and matter of a Fast consists
therein especially: and therefore the Scripture most usually expresses
abstinence from food when it mentions a fast. Fast (says Ester) and neither
eat nor drink. Est. 4. 16.
Let neither man nor beast (says the King of Nineveh, when he proclaimed a
Fast) taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water. Ion. 3. 7.
Of David it is also noted, that in the day of his Fast, 2 Samuel 12. 16.
he would not eat meat.

Quest. Whether it be lawful to eat or drink in the time of a Fast.
May not then in the time of a religious Fast any nourishment be taken?

Answ. To resolve this doubt, respect must be had both to the continuance of a
Fast, and also to the persons that fast.

1 There may be occasions to continue a Fast longer then the strength of man is
able to endure; and then so much food as may preserve nature, and maintain
health and strength, may, and must be taken: yet with these two prouisoes.

1 That the food which in such a case is taken, be not delicate, but rather
course; so it be agreeable to his nature that takes it.

2 That it be not taken unto fullness, but rather so sparingly, as the person
which fasteth may feel the want of food; so as no more then needs must for
the preservation of health and strength is to be taken.

Such a Fast as this, Dan. 9. 3.
was that which Daniel kept for three weeks; and with the forenamed prouisoes
was it observed.

2 Among the persons that keep a Fast, some may be of a good and strong
constitution, and able without weakening their bodies to abstain from all
sustenance a day or two: these ought altogether to abstain, though they feel
some want of food. Others are so weak, as if their stomachs be clean empty
of all food, they are unfit for any good duty: yea, if long they continue
empty, they may be so weakened as hardly they will recover their strength
again. Many women when they are breeding and with child, cannot leave
reatching (as we speak) after they rise in a morning, till they have eaten
something. Four and twenty hours fasting may make many aged and sickly
persons so weak, as they cannot be able with comfort to perform any religious
duty. Such persons therefore may so far forth refresh themselves as their
need and weakness require. Though we have no example of this case propounded
in Scipture, yet we have a sufficient ground for it, namely, that rule which
both in the old and also in the new Testament is laid down in these words; I
will have mercy, and not sacrifice. To Fast, Hose. 6. 6.
is not more then Sacrifice, Mat. 12. 7
to succor the body according to the need thereof, is mercy.

. 103. Of forbearing other things beside food in a Fast.
1 AS food is most especially to be forborne in a Religious Fast, 1. Food.
What things are to be forborne in a Fast.
being principally intended under this phrase of refreshing bodies; so are
sundry other things also ^ending thereto implied, as these which follow:

2 Sleep, 2. Sleep.
which is intimated in the direction that the Prophet gives in these words,
Lie all night in sackcloth, Joel 1. 13. Non solum ab eius sed a cunctis
illecebris abstinendum. Hieron.
whereby is intended that either they should all night forbear sleep, or else
that by wearing sackcloth, they should be kept from overmuch sleep (wherein
they that lie in fine linen and soft beds, are prone to exceed.) Thus David
to keep himself from sleep in the time of his fast, would not come into a
bed, 2 Samuel 12. 16.
but lay all night upon the earth. Though those particular rites of wearing
sackcloth, lying on the earth, sitting up all night, with the like, be not
ouerstrictly to be urged, or used, yet the equity of them is still to be
observed; which is, that in the day of a Fast we sleep less, and rise sooner
then at other times, that so the body may be somewhat the more afflicted
thereby, and that the more time may be gained for religious duties. If some
sleep be not forborne, the want of food will not be so much felt, nor the
body so humbled and afflicted as it should be.

3 Soft and brave apparel: 3 Brave apparel.
The Lord expressly commanded his people, Exodus 34. 4, 5.
to put off their costly raiment; and so they did in the day of their
humiliation. It is recorded and commended, Ion. 3. 6.
that the King of Nineveh in the day of a fast laid his robe from him. 2 Samuel
12. 20.
When the time of David's Fast was ended, then he changed his apparel: whereby
is intimated, that in his Fast he did not wear such apparel as at other
times he did. If Kings thus laid aside their royal apparel, much more must
others lay aside brave and costly apparel. The rite of putting on sackcloth
which the Jews used, shows that brave apparel may not be worn; no not
such as at others times is lawful. Our Gentry upon mere fashion retain some
shadow hereof, in that for the time of Lent they lay aside all light colors,
and go in black.

4 Matrimonial benevolence. 4 Matrimonial benevolence.
The exception which the Apostle makes of fasting and prayer, 1 Cor. 7. 5.
when he disswadeth man and wife from defrauding one another, shows that this
in the time of a Fast must be forborne: which also Joel implies, by bidding
the Bridegroom and Bride go out of their Chamber. Joel 2. 16.


5 Ordinary works of our calling: 5 Works of our calling.
for they are expressly forbidden in the Law; and in that it says, that the day
of a Fast shall be a Sabbath of rest; Leu. 16. 29. 31, and 23, 32.
it implies, that as a Sabbath it must be sanctified, and no manner of work
done therein:

6 All pleasant and delightsome things. 6 All pleasant things.
The Jews who at other times were wont to use sweet smelling oil, wherewith
they anointed their head, and other parts o^ their body, did in the time of
their Fast forbear to use it^ as is noted in the examples of David and Daniel:
even s^ ought* 2 Samuel 12. 20.
such delightful things as are in use among us b^ laid aside. Dan. 10. 3.


7 All manner of sports, pastimes, and recreations: 7. Sports.
for creation of the body by sports, is contrary to humiliation. (...) food,
sleep, costly apparel, matrimonial benevolence, works of our calling, sweet
perfumes, with the like, must be forborne, much more recreations, which are not
so necessary as the other, and yet more delightsome.

To conclude, such forbearance of refreshing the body is required in the time
of a Fast, as may be felt, and by the sense thereof the body something
afflicted: so did the Jews, as may be gathered out of this their
expostulation, Wherefore have we fasted, and afflicted our soul? Isa. 58. 3.
which though it were the expostulation of hypocrites, yet of such as in
outward religious exercises imitated the Saints. But more directly is this
proved by a like phrase which Ezra that good and learned Scribe used* saying;
Ezr. 8. 21.
I proclaimed a Fast, that we might afflict our selves before God.

Object. Col. 2 25* Expounded.
This is such a superstitious practice, as the Apostle reproves under this
phrase of not sparing the body.

Answ. Not so^ for then should he condemn his own practice in keeping under
his body, and b^inging it into subjection. 1 Cor. 9 27. Expounded.
There is a great difference betwixt not sparing the body and keeping the body
under. By not sparing the body (to omit the superstitious conceit, which they
whom the Apostle reproves, had of pleasing God thereby) he means such an
excess as weakeneth nature: but by keeping under his body, he means such a
moderate forbearance of the things wherein the body delighted, as the corrupt
flesh, even the old man might be subdued, and not pampered. In the former place
a man's outward body is weakened, and the corrupt flesh not subdued: in the
latter place, the corrupt flesh is tamed, and yet the strength of a man's
outward body not impaired. What contradiction then is there betwixt these two
places?

. 104. Of the occasions of a fast.
THis word, II. Point. What is meant by seasonable abstinence.
Seasonable, in the description of a religious Fast, has respect to the time
of a Fast: under which circumstance both the occasion, and also the continuance
of a Fast is comprised. For that is seasonably and in due time done, which on
just occasion is one, and which is so far done as may stand with a man's
ability to endure, without destroying or impairing nature. Here therefore we
will consider:

1 The occasions of a Fast.

2 The continuance thereof.

The occasions of fasting must be (as we heard. 99.
before of extraordinary prayer) extraordinary, as when any extraordinary
blessing is withheld, or taken away from us: or any judgment is threatened, or
inflicted: or else when any grievous sin is committed, for which there is
cause to fear Gods heavy vengeance, with the like: and that either in our
own behalf, or in the behalf of others.

The blessing for which Annah fasted as well as prayed, 1 Samuel 1. 7.
(for the text says, she did not eat) though it were but a private and
temporary blessing, was extraordinary. So also that deliverance for obtaining
whereof, 2 Cro. 20. 3.
Iehosaphat with the Jews in his time, Est. 4. 16. 17.
and Esther and Mordecai with the Jews in their time fasted, was extraordinary.

The spiritual blessing for which the Church fasted when they sent forth
Apostles and ordained Elders, Act. 13. 3, and 14. 23.
was, extraordinary.

The judgment which was denounced against Nineveh (for preventing whereof they
fasted) Ion. 3. 7. Joel. 1. 13. 14.
and which was inflicted on Israel in Ioels time (for removing whereof they
also fasted) were extraordinary.

The sin, for committing whereof, the Israelites fasted in Samuels time, 1 Samuel 7. 4, 6.
was extraordinary.

The occasions which moved Ezra, Ezr. 9. 2, etc.
Nehemiah and Esther to fast in the behalf of others, Nehe. 1. 4.
were extraordinary. Est. 4. 16,


Read all the fasts recorded and approved in the Scripture, and ye shall find
the occasions of them to be extraordinary.

. 105. Of set times of Fast.
THis is to be noted against the superstitious weekly, monthly, quarterly,
and yearly set fasts of Papists, who having no respect at al to the occasion,
inioyne people for conscience sake to fast every friday, the eues before most
of their holidays, every ember week and the time of Lent: at which times may
fall out occasions of rejoicing. So common a practice of fasting without due
respect had to the occasion, makes it lose the due respect thereof.

Object. Zac. 8. 19. Expounded.
The Jews in the time of the captivity had many set fasts in the year, as in
the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months.

Answ. They had special and extraordinary occasions both to fast in those
months, and also to continue every year to fast in them so long as they did
fast. The occasions were these: In the Ier. 52. 4.
tenth month Jerusalem began to be besieged, which was the first sign of that
horrible vengance, that God by his Prophets had often threatened to take of the
rebellious Jews. In the Ier. 52. 6, 7.
fourth month, the City was broken up, whereby God openly showed that now he
had forsaken that City. In the Ier. 52. 12, 13.
fifth month were not only the Kings house and all the houses of Jerusalem,
but also the house of God, that famous Temple which Solomon built, burnt down
to the ground, whereby the Lord declared that now his presence, and protection
was clean taken away from them. In the 2 King. 25. 25.
seventh month Gedaliah was slain. Ier. 41. 1.
This Gedaliah was appointed a Governor over that remnant of people which were
left in Judea, after the greater sort of them were carried away captives: now
when he was slain, even all that remnant also was scattered, none remained;
which was a further declaration of the extent of Gods wrath against them. Thus
God many ways manifesting his indignation against the Jews, they had just
cause even with fasting to humble themselves all those times: and because they
felt the smart of every one of those strokes all the time of of the captivity,
they continued (as there was just cause) their times of humiliation by fasting,
till the captivity was ended: but after that Gods favorable countenance was
turned to them again, Zac. 8, 19.
they left off those days of fast. Now the Papists can show no such cause of
their forenamed set fasts: so as the example of the Jews can be no warrant to
them.

2 Object. The same days are observed in our Church for fasting days.

Answ. They are retained by us only as politic and civil fasts, for the
better preservation of flesh, but maintained by them as religious fasts.

. 106. Of the continuance of a Fast.
TO know the right and due continuance of a fast, it is needful to put
difference betwixt a fast in whole, and in part. A fast in whole is such a fast
as we have described, wherein there is an utter abstinence (except in case of
necessity) from refreshing the body with any food at all. A fast in part, is
when a man takes some nourishment in the days of his fast: What is a fast in
part.
and this is when there is occasion of fasting longer then a man is able to
forbear all manner of sustenance: for example a man of great use, whose death
is a very great loss, is stricken with a dangerous sickness, and lies
betwixt hope and fear some week or more: their issue being unknown, his
friends earnestly desirous of his life, continue to fast and pray every day,
till they see what issue the Lord will give: now because of the long
continuance of such a fast, every day they take one meal to preserve the
strength of their body. The like fast may be used when a City is besieged, and
the inhabitants enclosed by their enemies on every side. Now because such a
fast may be long endured, and the occasion thereof may be longer or shorter,
no set time can be set for the continuance of it, but only that it be ordered
according to the occasion that God gives.

As for the other more true and proper Fast, a Fast in whole, which was
described *. 102. and 103.
before, and whereof we do now especially speak; a whole natural day is a
fit time for the continuance of it. A natural da^ is a fit time for a proper
Fast.
Our natural day consists of four and twenty hours: Of less continuance a
Religious Fast (as I take it) may not be. In the Law the day of a fast is
called a Sabbath: Leu. 16. 31.
the time of a Sabbath must therefore be allotted unto it: now a Sabbath
contains the seventh part of a week, which is four and twenty hours. Where
Esther inioyneth a Fast of three days, Est. 4. 16.
she mentions the night as well as the days, showing thereby, that the
night must be reckoned as a part of that day wherein a Fast is observed.

In the space of four and twenty hours only one ordinary meal is forborne,
(the Fast beginning at the end of one meal, and when the Fast is ended,
another meal being taken:) but less then one meal in a Fast cannot be
forborne. This therefore is the shortest time, which yet will appear to be
long enough, if a Fast be rightly and duly observed. For the last meal which
is taken before a Fast, ought to be a very moderate and spare meal; so
moderate, as so soon as it is taken, we may without heaviness, drowsinesse,
and dullness, set ouselues to examination, meditation, conference, reading,
prayer, and such like religious exercises in private, as a preparation unto the
more solemn exercises to be performed in a Fast. Most meet it is that this
preparation be in the evening, and the Fast then to begin. From even to even
(says the Law) shall ye celebrate your Sabbath: Leu. 23. 32.
meaning a Fast. So as immediately after a spare supper, all servile works of
our calling laid aside, the forenamed preparation is to begin, and continue
so long as conveniently we can sit up, even longer and later then on other
days we use to go to bed. Then after some sleep is taken, in the next
morning rising sooner then ordinarily we use to do, after some renewing of our
preparation, the rest of the time even till the four and twenty hours from
the beginning of our evening preparation, be ended, is to be spent in the
solemn exercises of Religion appertaining to a Fast. If a Fast be continued,
as has been before set down, two whole days, it is as much as our weak
nature can well endure, without impairing the health and strength of our body.

Object. Paul, Acts 27. 33.
and they which were in the ship with him, fasted fourteen days, and took
nothing.

Answ. They are said to fast, In what sense Paul and his company are said to
fast 14. days.
because being all that time in danger of their lives, much perplexed, and
busied in saving the ship, they had no leisure to take one ordinary meal: so
as that was not a propper Fast, but yet an extraordinary abstinence, no more
taken then was necessary to preserve life: and therefore Paul fearing lest some
of them might faint, exhorted them to take some meat, adding this reason, This
is for your health, as for this phrase ( They took nothing) it is but an
hyperbolicall speech.

2 Object. Esther, Esther 4. 16.
and the Jews in her time fasted three days and three nights together.

Answ. The Jews lived under an hotter climate then we do, and in that respect
could endure to fast longer then we which live in the Northern and colder
part of the world.

. 107. Of Supplication, the most principal end of a Religious Fast.
THe last point noted in the description of a Religious Fast, concerns those
duties of Religion which are the end of a Fast, and for our better fitting,
whereunto a Fast is undertaken. The most principal duty of all is
supplication: whereunto as subordinate to prayer, may be added Examination,
humiliation, mortification, etc. Because extraordinary prayer is the most
especial end of fasting, I have annexed fasting as an help thereunto: for
which I have good warrant by the usual tenor of the Scripture, which ioineth
Fasting and Prayer together. When the Prophets saw cause to use extraordinary
Prayer, they were wont to call upon the people to fast. Joel 2. 15. 17.
Sanctify a Fast (says Joel) when upon an extraordinary occasion he
prescribed a form of prayer for them to use. In like manner says Ezra; Ezr.
8. 21.
I proclaimed a Fast, that we might seek of God a right way, etc. And
accordingly they observed his direction, and joined fasting and prayer
together: for says he, We fasted, and be sought our God, Verse 23.
etc. So says Nehemiah of himself, Nehe. 1. 4.
I fasted and prayed. And of the Church in the new Testament, it is said, when
they sent forth Paul and Barnabas, Acts 13. 3.
they fasted and prayed: and when they ordained Elders, Acts 14. 23.
they Prayed and fasted.

Great reason there is to add Fasting to extraordinary Prayer: Why Fasting is
added to Prayer.
for when there is an extraordinary occasion of Prayer, extraordinary ardency
and continuance in prayer must be used, as was. 95.
before showed. Now fasting does quicken our spirits, 1 Fasting is an help to
Prayer.
and rowse up our dull hearts, and so both sharpen our prayers, adding life and
efficacy unto them, and also make us able to hold out, and continue the longer
in Prayer. For as fullness makes a man drowsy in body, and heavy in spirit,
(so as he can neither pray ardently, nor continue long in prayer) so fasting
makes him fresh and cheerful both in body and spirit. Note the most ardent
and long continued supplications in Scripture, 2 Fasting is a sign of our
earnest desire.
and you shall find them supported by fasting. Besides, as fasting is an help
to prayer, so it is a testification of our vehement and earnest desire of
obtaining that which we pray for: for by our voluntary abstaining from ordinary
food, and other delights of our body, we show that we prefer the thing which
we pray for, before them.

The other duties which were reckoned up among the ends of a Religious Fast, as
Examination, humiliation, and mortification, (as was before noted) subordinate
unto Prayer, and helpefull thereunto: In that fasting therefore is used for the
better performance of them, in the use of them it proves to be a further help
for prayer; which will the better appear, if distinctly we consider how
fasting makes us more fit to perform these duties.

. 108. Of Examination, another end of Fasting.
COncerning Examination of our selves, Examination needful for Prayer.
we cannot be ignorant, but that when any needful extraordinary blessing is to
be obtained, or any judgment to be prevented or removed, it is very requisite
to search whether there be not any sin in us which may make our prayers to be
rejected and not regarded. That which the Lord said of the Army of Israel in
Iosuahs time, Ios. 7. 11. 12.
may be applied to particular persons, namely, that if they did not search, and
find out, and take away the execrable, and excommunicate among them, the Lord
would not be with them any more: Lam. 3. 40, 41.
wherefore the Prophet exhorts first to search, and try our ways, and turn
to the Lord; and then to lift up our hearts with our hands unto God in the
Heavens.

Now by fasting, How fasting is an help to examination.
we both gain more time for examination, (even that time which otherwise would
be spent in sleeping, eating, drinking, and other like things, which in the day
of a Fast are forborne) and also make ourselves more fit thereto, in that our
spirits are cheered, and our hearts rowsed up thereby, as was noted. 104.
before. This the Saints well knew, and therefore were wont in the days of
their Fast to enter into a serious and solemn examination of their own, and
of others sins. Read the Prayer that Ezra made in the day of his Fast, Ezr.
9. 6, etc.
and in it you may observe how he searches out the sins of the Jews in his
time, which had provoked the wrath of God, and sets them in order before
God. So did the Levites in that Fast which was kept in Nehemiahs time. Nehe. 9.
16, etc.


. 109. Of Humiliation, a third end of Fasting.
COncerning Humiliation, Humiliation needful for Prayer.
it is well known, that they which look to prevail by Prayer with God, must
come before him with an humbled heart. To him (says the Lord) will I look
that is poor, Isa. 66. 2. How fasting is an help to humiliation.
and of a contrite spirit. Now by fasting we manifest our unworthiness of the
least of Gods blessings, and so testify great humiliation; yea, the very rites
of a Fast are a means to humble the soul somewhat the more. By laying aside
our best apparel, by our voluntary abstinence from Gods Creatures, by
forbearing some of our ordinary sleep, and by refusing in other respects to
refresh our bodies, we show that we think our selves unworthy of any outward
delights, yea of the least crumme of bread, and drop of water. In old time they
were wont to wear Ion. 3. 5. Dan. 9. 3.
sackcloth in the time of a Fast, to show that the worst clothing was good
enough: and Neh 9. 1. Ios. 7. 6.
to lay dust upon their heads, to show that they thought themselves more worthy
to be under the ground, then to tread upon it. Again, when we fast, because
God is displeased for our sin, and as a token of his displeasure, inflicteth
some judgment upon us, we do not only manifest our great grief for
displeasing God, but also after an holy manner take vengeance of our selves,
which is an especial point of humiliation, commended in the Corinthians. 2.
Cor. 7. 11.


. 110. Of Mortification, a fourth end of fasting.
COncerning Mortification, Mortification needful for prayer.
. 20.
It has been before showed, that the lusts of the flesh, and the wanton
affections thereof, are a great hindrance to fervent prayer: being as birdlime
to the feathers of a foul, which keep it from mounting high. Yea it is more
clear then needs be proved, that they continually fight against the spirit,
and are a means to quench it; so as the spirit is kept from making requests
for us, so long as lust boyleth and domineereth in us. Necessary it is
therefore, that in this respect the body be beaten down, and brought into
subjection. But fasting is an especial means to subdue our wanton flesh, How
fasting is an help to mortification.
and corrupt lusts: for as pampering our bodies adds strength to the old
man, so fasting mortifieth it, and keeps it down. The Apostle, where he
implies, 1. Cor. 7. 5.
that while man and wife give themselves to fasting and prayer, may the better
abstain, intimates that by fasting and prayer lust is subdued.

. 111. Of fasting now under the New Testament.
BY that which has hitherto been delivered in explication of a religious
Fast, we may well conclude, that it is a warrantable, commendable and needful
exercise: Warrantable, because commended: Commendable, because the practice
thereof is commended: Needful, because of the ends. 107. etc.
before Propounded. It is therefore an exercise carefully and conscionably to
be observed of us.

Object. It is no where commanded in the new Testament.

Answ. 1. The commandment of fasting is of perpetual force.
The Apostles and Churches practice thereof in the time of the Gospel, shows
that the Commandments of the old Testament concerning fasting, were not as
other ceremonial ordinances, of force only for the time of the law, but of
perpetual use so long as a Church should remain on earth.

2 The answer which Christ gave to the Pharisees in defense of his Disciples
not fasting, Matthew. 9. 15.
in these words, The days will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken from
them, and then shall they fast, has the force of a precept.

3 The same occasions, and the same ends of fasting which were under the Law,
still remain under the Gospel (what these occasions and ends are, has bin
showed. 104. 107, etc.
before) wherefore, as we make conscience of other duties, so let us make
conscience of this also. As God does manifest his just indignation against us,
by threatening or inflicting any judgment, or by withholding, or taking away
any blessing, so let us manifest our true humiliation by fasting. Motives to
fast.
Fasting added to prayer, makes it extraordinarily powerful, as appears by
these three evidences.

1 By the great and wonderful things which the Saints have obtained thereby.
1. Sam. 1. 5. etc.
Annah, though the Lord had made her barren, obtained a child. The Jews in
Iehosaphats time obtained an extraordinary victory. 2. Chro. 20. 3, 22.
And in Esthers time a memorable preservation. Many like examples are noted in
the Scripture. Esther 4. 16.


2 By that respect which God has had to the fasting of Hypocrites: 1. King.
21. 29.
as is noted in the example of Ahab. If God were moved to stay a temporal
judgment threatened against a wicked man upon his temporary humiliation by
fasting, what will he not do upon the true humiliation of his faithful
children by fasting?

3 By that instance which Christ gives of casting out such a kind of Devil
by fasting and prayer, Matthew. 17. 21.
as by no other means can be cast out. If an extraordidary Devil may be cast
out by fasting and prayer, when he has gotten possession in a man, how much
more may diabolical passions and corruptions be cast out of a man by this
means? No marvel that the Devil so much prevails every where, seeing this
sovereign means of weakening his power is so much neglected. We in this Land
have done our selves much wrong by neglect of this duty:

That which. 115.
afterward shall be spoken of motives to extraordinary prayer, and of our
negligence therein, may in particular be applied to this help of prayer.

. 112. Of Vows.
THe other helps to extraordinary prayer is making of Vows, which is both
expressly commanded, ( Psalm^ 76. 11.) and also has been by Gods children much
practiced. Iaakob vowed a vow to God as he was going to his uncle Laban, Vows
an help to extraordinary prayer.
( Genesis 28. 20. 21.) So did Annah (1 Samuel 1. 11) David ( Psalm. 132. 2.) and
many other Saints.

(...). Ea proprie intelligenda est oration, quam facimus ad votum, id est
(...). August. Epist. 59. Reasons.
Vowing is so proper to praying that the Greek word which in the new Testament
most usually signifies prayer, seems to be drawn from a vow.

1 To vow in praying does much sharpen our prayers, and make us more eagerly
call upon God.

2 It does manifest a very earnest desire of obtaining the thing we desire: it
argues that we are willing to do any thing, or part with any thing to obtain
it.

3 It does as it were set a tutor over us, to call upon us to perform our duty,
to check us when we are slack therein, and to keep us within that compass
that we have set unto our selves.

Object. This was a thing belonging rather to the pedagogy of the Jews, then
to the ripe age of Christians under the Gospel.

Answ. Indeed because the Church before Christ's time was but in her nonage,
in comparison of that manage whereunto since Christ's time it is grown, vows
were then more usual, then they are now. Yea at that time their voluntary
vows were parts of Gods worship, as other rites and ceremonies which were
enjoined them of God were, whereunto we are not now so strictly bound. So as
there is some difference betwixt the time of the Law, and of the Gospel in
this respect. Yet notwithstanding are not all vows, and the use of them
utterly abolished: they still remain lawful and helpful unto us.

For though we are attained to a riper age then that of the Jews, yet are we
not come to a perfect age* we are but children in regard of that measure of
the age of the fullness of Christ, Ephesians. 4. 13.
whereunto the spirits of just and per^ect men in Heaven attain. So as still
we have need of helps: and among other helps, this of vows is needful, and may
be profitable unto us.

. 113. Of the things which concur to the making of a lawful vow.
Wherefore for our direction in using this help, Directions for making vows.
we must observe what things concur to the making of a good and lawful vow:
even those four things whereby every thing is made good, the four causes,
which are, 1. The maker of the vow. 2. The matter of it. 3. The manner thereof.
4. The end.

1 The person who makes a vow, 1 Who may make a vow.
must be both of understanding, and also of power to make it. In vowing we have
to do with God, who must not be dallied withal, nor mocked. They who deal
with him must well conceive what they do; (wherefore Idiots, children, frenzy
persons, and such like, are not fit to vow) they must also have an ability to
perform what they vow (wherefore such as are under the authority and command
of others may not vow, in such cases wherein their Governors may cross their
vow.)

2 The thing vowed, 2 What may be vowed.
must be both lawful and possible. Acts 23. 18.
To vow to commit a sin (as the Jews vowed to kill Paul) is a double
iniquity. To vow that which we are not able to do (as many who vow perpetual
continency) is a plain mockery.

3 In regard of the manner, 3 How a vow is to be made.
a vow must be made freely and maturely. A vow is a kind of spiritual
offering, it must therefore be a free will offering, or else Psalm. 119. 18.
can it not be acceptable to God. It is not meet for Parents to force their
children, or any man to force another to make a vow.

A vow is also a matter of weight, it must be made in judgment upon due
consideration and deliberation, not rashly or unadvisedly. Judge. 11. 30, 31.
Herein did Ieptha (though otherwise a good man) offend. Rash vows canse
either much mischief, or much repentance. In vouendo stultus in reddendo
impius. Hier Ibid.


4 There be two maine ends of a vow. 4 Why a vow is to be made.
One to prevent or redress some sin (as for a man which is of a flexible
disposition, and much drawn away by vain company to vow against such and such
company: or for a man that has a light brain, and is soon made drunken with
strong beer and wine, to vow against these.) The other to hold a man close to
some duty; as to vow every day to read so much, or so much of the Scripture,
morning and evening to pray, to sanctify the Sabbath, etc.

Object. We are bound to perform all these things, though they be not vowed.

Answ. We vow those things which we are otherwise bound to do, in regard of
our own dullness and backwardnes, that so we may by a double bond (one of Gods
law, the other of our vow) be the more provoked to do them. Iaakobs vow made
to God in these words: ( The Lord shall be my God:) was a duty commanded. Genesis
28. 21.

A vow being thus made, we are bound in conscience to perform it: c Pay
therefore that which thou have vowed. It is better that thou should not vow,
then that thou should vow and not pay it.

. 114. Of public and private Fasts and vows.
AS the occasions of fasting and vowing are public or private, so must they
be done publikly or privately. Because there was a public judgment on the
land, Joel. 2. 14.
Joel the Prophet called the people to a public fast. Ezra 10. 3.
So likewise Ezra caused a public vow to to made of all the people. Annahs
occasion was private and particular, accordingly was her f fast and g vow.

A public fast or vow must be appointed by public authority (as were all the
public fasts and vows recorded and commended in the Scripture) and performed
by all that are under their authority, and in their dominion who command it.
When Iehosaphat proclaimed a public fast, it is noted that they came out of
all the Cities of Judah: and when Josiah made a public vow and Covenant with
the Lord: He caused all that were found in Judah, and Beaiamine to stand to it.

The Ministers of the word, ought to put the Magistrates in mind of these
extraordinary exercises, when there is occasion (as Joel did) The Magistrate
ought to appoint them: and Magistrates, Ministers, People, and all observe
them: and for the better observing thereof, assemble together in public
places, and use the public Ministry of the word: for which we have a notable
pattern of the Jews in the time of Nehemiah: for when the people were all
assembled together, with fasting to make a solemn vow: Neh. 9 3.
the Levites read in the book of the Law of the Lord their God, one fourth part
of the day, and another fourth part of the day they confessed, and worshipped
the Lord their God. These two fourth parts, were all the time that passed
betwixt the morning and evening Sacrifice, namely from nine to three.

As for private fasts and vows if they be performed in a family, the Master
thereof who is a King, Priest, and Prophet in his own house, has the ordering
thereof. But every particular Christian has liberty in secret by himself, to
use these extraordinary exercises as he sees just cause; if at least he be not
under the power and command of another, to whom his time and service is due.
When Magistrates are negligent in appointing those public exercises in their
seasons, private Christians may for their parts make some supply thereof in
their families, or at least in secret by themselves.

. 115. Of Motives to extraordinary Prayer.
Weighty motives there be to stir us up to extraordinary Prayer.

1 It shows that we go along with Gods good guiding providence: that we
observe Gods judgments, and are moved with them, and take notice of his
blessings, and are accordingly affected: that as the judgments of God are
greater, so our supplication and humiliation more extraordinary: as his
blessings more needful and scanty, so our petitions more earnest and fervent:
and as they are more excellent and plentiful, so our thanksgiving more
solemn. They who content themselves with their ordinary manner of praying,
(like mil-horses going round in their usual tracke) and never take any
occasion of extraordinary prayer, but think all is well, because they are not
Atheists, which never call upon God, plainly discover how little they regard
Gods dealing with them. If they did, as God dealt extraordinarily with them, so
would they extraordinarily carry themselves toward God.

2 Extraordinary prayer is extraordinarily powerful and effectual, either for
preventing and removing great judgments, or for obtaining and recovering
singular blessings, as we have. 99.
before showed.

3 It is an extraordinary honor done unto God: the more we stoop under his
judgments, and the more highly we account his blessings and favors, the more
we glorify God.

. 116. Of the neglect of extraordinary Prayer.
November 1612. Had extraordinary prayer in time been used, no doubt but many
of these judgments might have been prevented. Would there be so many
insufficient, idle, careless, corrupt Ministers, as are in many places? or
would the diligence and pains of many learned and faithful Ministers be so
fruitless as they are, if extraordinary prayer were more used? What may be the
reason that many marriages, offices, callings, and the like matters of moment
are so unprosperous? that many Christians long lie under sore and grievous
temptations and crosses, that other judgments are inflicted upon their
families, their children, yea, and their own persons, and many needful
blessings denied? Surely this duty is not used as it ought to be. Let it
therefore more frequently and conscionably be used.

Hitherto of the several kinds of Prayer.

THE THIRD PART.
The time of Prayer.
. 117. Of praying always.
THe next branch is concerning the Time, How we may pray always.
which by the Apostle is limited with no distinct time, but indefinitely set
down under this general particle Always.

If this circumstance be simply taken without any limitation, it implies not
only a great inconvenience, but also a plain impossibility. For is it not
inconvenient that we should attend wholly and only on prayer; and so neglect
the Word, Sacraments, and other duties of piety? yea, also all duties of
justice, and charity to our neighbors? Is it possible that always we should
pray, and not eat, drink, sleep, and do such other things as nature
necessarily requires?

Answ. If the true meaning of the Apostles phrase be observed, no such
incongruity or impossibility will follow upon it. In the original it is thus
set down word for word, (...)
In every season.

The Greeks make a difference betwixt (...).
Time, and season: and Acts 1. 7.
in the Scripture they are also distinguished, Time is more general, 1 These.
5. 1.
Season implies that part of time which is fit for doing a thing. This phrase
then being translated in every season, implies that as any just occasion is
offered, we must pray.

Object. The Evangelist uses the word which properly signifies (...). ^. Luke
18. 1. Ephe. 5. 20.
Always, and so does the Apostle in laying down the point of thanksgiving,
and another phrase of the like extent, saying, 1 These. 5. 17 (...).
Pray without ceasing:

Answ. 1. General phrases must be expounded by particular and distinct
phrases.

2 Those Generals do sometime signify no more then very often: so are 1 King.
10. 8.
Salomons servants said to stand ever, or continually before him. So we say of
a Student that is much in his study, he is always or continually there: so of
a woman that tarrieth much at home, she is ever in her house. But more
distinctly to show the meaning of this circumstance,

1 It is to be taken inclusiuely, including every part of time, and excluding
none, neither day nor night, whether we are alone or in company, in the
midst of business, or free from business, at what time soever occasion is
given, we must pray.

2 It signifies a daily and constant performing of this holy exercise: thus
this sacrifice which under the Law was constantly offered up every day, morning
and evening, is said to be offered up Ex. 29. 38, 42
continually, and called a continual burnt offering.

3 It implies that besides our ordinary and set times of prayer, we must take
extraordinary occasions to call upon God.

4 It intimates a continual preparation of the heart always, even every
moment ready to be lift, up to God in prayer. As the air with the least blast
of wind is moved, and a feather with the least motion of air is lifted up, so
must our hearts in petition and thanksgiving.

Thus this phrase being rightly taken, affords no just ground to those
heretics called (...) ab orando sic appellati, isti ita nimis orant, vt hinc
iudicentur inter haereticos nominandi. Aug. haer. 57
Euchitae, who would seem to spend so much time in prayer, as they neglected
all other duties: like to whom were the Heretics called Lege Theodoret. hist.
lib. 4. cap. 11. de Messalianis.
Messalians. But it affords unto us many good instructions for prayer.

. 118. Of praying every day.
1 CHristians ought to have set times of prayer every day. 1 Every day pray.
This is implied in the fourth Petition, where this day, is expressed, to show
that the next day we must pray again, and every day say, this day. This is
also prefigured by that continual burnt offering, whereof I spoke. 117.
before. Psalm. 96. 2.
David exhorts hereunto saying, Sing unto the Lord, praise his name from day
to day: and promises to perform as much himself, saying, and 145. 2.
I will bless thee daily, and praise thy name for ever and ever.

1 We daily stand in need of Gods blessings, Reasons.
both of the continuance of his old blessings, and also of bestowing new
blessings. Needful it is therefore, that every day we should pray for them.

2 The graces of God in us are subject every day to decay: now prayer is as
food, whereby those graces are preserved, revived and increased. Daily we take
bodily food? Daily also let us use this spiritual food.

3 Every day we are subject to assaults of our spiritual enemies, who are
never wearied: and unto many dangers of soul and body. But prayer is the most
principal means to keep us safe from all.

There are also like reasons for thanksgiving always, day after day. Psalm.
68. 19.
For God ladeth us daily with his blessings: every day, yea every hour, both
Gods former blessings are continued and renewed, and also new blessings
bestowed. Is thy life, health, liberty, or any other blessing, matter of
thanksgiving this day? Then if the same be renewed the next day, it is also
matter of thanksgiving the next day, and so day after day. Continual matter of
thanksgiving, requires continual thanksgiving.

. 119. Of the fittest times for daily prayer.
Quest. HOw often a day is it meet we should pray, Singulis diebus qui amplius
non potest, faltem duabus vicibus oret mane scil. and vespere Council.
Constantinop. 6. cap. 7. Vide Cries. exhort. ad matutinas, and vesp. orationes.
Hom. 14. in Romans 8.
and at what times?

Answ. Not to speak of sudden eiaculations, which we shall touch by and by, it
is meet that solemn prayers be made at least twice a day. The fittest time
for which is the morning and the evening. In the morning to praise God for our
rest the night before, and to crave his protection over us, and his blessing
upon us the day following. In the evening to praise him for the blessings
received that day, and to crave his protection in the night when we sleep.
Thus shall this spiritual sacrifice of the Ose. 14. 3.
Calves of our lips be answerable to that Number. 28. 4.
daily outward sacrifice of lambs, under the Law, whereof one was to be
offered in the morning, the other in the evening. This time Psalm. 92. 2.
David prescribes saying to God, It is a good thing to declare thy loving
kindness in the morning, and thy truth at night: yea and 55. 17.
David went further, and says, Evening and morning, and at noone will I pray.
Which times it is likely that Daniel observed, for he prayed Dan. 6. 10.
three times a day. David yet further says, Psalm. 119. 164.
Seven times a day do I praise thee. But that I take to be meant of some
extraordinary occasions, because his ordinary course was set down before: or
else aset number for an uncertain, seven times, that is, oftentimes, and so
meant of sudden prayers.

Against this do they offend, who never pray but at Church upon Sabbath days,
or some other solemn days, or if ever at home, only then when some
extraordinary occasion is offered, as if they, or some of theirs be sick, if
they fear some judgment, or want some great blessing. What hope can such have
to be heard in their great needs, who otherwise would not call upon God.

. 120. Of constant keeping our set times of prayer.
2 SVch set times as are appointed for daily prayer, 2 Be constant in keeping
set times.
would constantly be kept. Else we do not in every season always without
intermission pray. The Lord says of the fore named daily sacrifice under the
Law, Number. 28. 2:
Ye shall observe to offer unto me in their due season mine offering, etc.
implying thereby, that they should not fail nor miss of their due season and
accustomed time. Fear of death could not turn Daniel from his course: he
prayed (notwithstanding the Kings contrary decree) three times a day, as he did
afore-time. This phrase, as afore-time, implies a constant course.

Great reason there is that we should be constant, for

1 There is in us a natural proanenesse to wax cold and faint in prayer.
Reasons.
Water is not more proane to be cold, nor an heavy weight to fall downward,
then we to wax dull in this heavenly exercise. Wherefore as fire must
constantly be put under water to keep it hot, and a weight must constantly be
wound up to keep it from the ground, so must we by constant prayer quicken up
our souls, and keep them aloft.

2 The Devil will take great advantage by once omitting it, and move us to omit
it again and again; and so by degrees bring us to an utter ^is-vse of it.
Assuredly they which once omit their course of praying, shall find the next
time they come to pray, a more then usual dullness thereto: which is partly
through Gods just judgment, who thus punishes our neglect of this duty, partly
through our natural indisposition thereto, and partly through the subtilty and
malice of the Devil, who thus seeks to divert us clean from our course.

. 121. Of Canonical hours.
Quest. What difference is there betwixt this constant observing set times,
and Popish canonical hours of prayers?

Answ. Reasons why Canonical hours unlawful.
1. Their canonical hours are grounded on superstition, as the reasons which
they themselves allege do show: for they appoint seven hours of prayer for
every day. 1. They are grounded on superstition.
The first before day, because Christ was then taken. The second at the first
hour, because then he was led to Pilat. The third at the third hour, because
then he was mocked. The fourth at the sixth hour: because then he was
crucified. The fifth at the ninth hour, because then he gave up the Ghost. The
sixth in the evening, because then he was taken from the Cross. The seventh in
the completory, because then he was buried. These reasons are superstitious, no
good grounds. In other hours we may find other things done to Christ, as his
bringing to Annas, to Caiphas, to Herod, his accusations, scourging, etc. and
so make every hour a canonical hour for prayer. We have better reasons, as
I showed. 120.
before.

2 They place Religion in the very observing of set times. 2. Religion is
placed in them.
We do not so: for we set not the same continuance for all, some may hold out
an hour, same half, some but a quarter, some longer, some shorter. Neither
do we tie all to the same hour. A strong able person that uses to rise
betimes, may pray at three or four, or five of the clock in the morning, as
soon as heriseth. Another that is weak, and notable to rise so soon, may
when he can rise.

3 They content themselves with saying over so many prayers as may be in such
a set time, 3. They are stinted with time.
though their hearts go not with one word: for their prayers being in lattin,
many cannot understand what they pray. We account such prayers mere
lip-labor. Neither do we measure our prayers by a set time, but we measure
our time by our devotion and affection in prayer.

4 They appropriate their canonical hours to ecclesiastical persons only, 4
They are appropriated to certain persons.
as Priests, Munks, Nuns, etc. We make our daily times of prayer common to
all Christians: because prayer is a duty belonging to all.

5 Some of their hours, 5 They are unseasonable.
namely, at midnight, are very unseasonable to be ordinarily and daily
performed: they are neither meet for the health of man (that being the most
seasonable time to rest in) nor for the worship of God, which must needs at
that time be drousily performed. Our times are the most seasonable that may be.

6 Their hours are so many, 6 Too much time is spent in them.
that other necessary businesses must needs be omitted: they afford not time
enough for Ministers to study, and perform other ministerial functions
belonging to their place. Our times are such as may well be affoorded to
prayer, by those that have the most and greatest employments.

7 They are so superstitious on the one side in keeping their number and
stinted hours, 7 Too great strictness in fulfilling the time.
and on the other side so careless in the due time, that they give
tollerations to observe all the seven hours in one part of the day, and none
in the other part. We affood no such tollerations. Evening prayer would not be
performed in the morning, though a double task of the Word may be read at
once.

. 122 Of neglecting times of Prayer.
them. Many suffer every small occasion, the least business, a matter of little
gain, yea, a matter of pleasure and sport to interrupt their course: They are
far from Dan. 6. 10.
Daniels mind. If they could truly feel and discern the sweetness and
comfort of prayer, they would be otherwise minded then they are. For our parts
let us prefer it to all things, and let all things whatsoever give place to
it. Thus shall we manifest our reverend and high account of God, of his
worship, and of his blessing. If in the morning necessary business be to be
performed, let us rise so much the sooner to pray, rather lose of our sleep
then omit that exercise: so at night, if extraordinary business hold thee up
late, sit up a little the longer for prayer sake. They who conscionably and
constantly use it, think not themselves safe in a morning, till they have
commended themselves by prayer to God: they are much disquieted, if by any
occasion it be omitted: some dare not eat, nor drink in a morning till they
have prayed, nor at even go to bed till they have prayed again. A good
religious mind.

123. Of praying in all affairs.
3 Whatsoever we go about, 3 Whatsoever ye do, or whithersoeuer ye go, pray.
or wheresoever we are, we must pray. If we go about any religious exercise,
any work of our calling, any duty of love, any honest and lawful recreation, we
must pray: when we go to meat, to sleep, to walk abroad, to ride a journey
pray, at home, in the field, in our Inn, in prison, on the sea, in a foreign
country, in time of prosperity, in time of adversity, in season, at our times
appointed, out of season, at other times, night and day pray. So much implies
the Apostle 1. Tim. 2. 8.
where he wills men to pray in every place, and these phrases, always, at al
times, continually, without ceasing, imply as much.

1 Prayer sanctifies every thing, Reasons.
every place, as we showed in the fifth branch of the necessity of prayer.

2 We cannot expect a blessing in any thing, except by prayer we crave it.
Psalm. 127. 2.
It is in vain to rise early, and to lie down late without prayer. Therefore
and 90. 17.
Moses prays that God would establish the works of their hands.



. 124. Of continual Eiaculations.
4 Our hearts ought every moment to be ready, 4 Hearts always ready to pray.
and prepared to be lift up to God: even when we have not opportunity of time
and place to utter any prayer with our mouths, in heart we must pray, as Exodus
14. 5. Nehem. 2. 4.
Moses and Nehemiah. This is that mental and sudden prayer whereof I spoke
before. Concerning this kind, if any shall ask (as Peter in another case did)
how often shall I pray in a day; seven times, Psalm. 119. 164.
as David did? I answer (as Christ did to Peter) I say not to thee unto seven
times, Matthew. 18. 22.
but unto seventy times seven times: even every moment, as the least occasion
is offered, and so often as the Spirit of God moves. If we observe our selves
or others to stand in need of any blessing, instantly let our hearts be lift up
to God: when any of Gods blessings come to our mind by the relation of others,
by our own cogitation, by any present fruition, or by any other means,
presently (in heart at least) bless God: learn of the little birds, which
lift up their bills to heaven, so often as they take a little water into them.

. 125. Of giving thanks always.
WE have an excellent pattern hereof in that man that was Act. 13. 22.
A man after Gods own heart, that 2. Sam. 23. 1.
sweet Singer of Israel: as he was very frequent upon all occasions in making
petition to God, so also in thanksgiving: many Psalms he begins and ends
with praise: yea every verse of Psalm. 150.
some Psalms begins with an exhortation hereunto: and every verse of Psalm
136.
other Psalms end with a thankful acknowledgement of Gods mercy: Psalm. 135.
19, 20, 21.
Diverse verses in many Psalms both begin and end with praising God. There is
nothing which that book of Psalms more tumbleth up and down (repeating it
very often again, and again) then this clause, Praise ye the Lord: yea his
Psalms of humiliation, which he begins with sobs and tears, he ends
with praise. A worthy pattern to follow: the more frequent we are in
thanksgiving; the more do we resemble the triumphant Church in heaven, Reu. 4.
8.
which cease not day nor night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.
and 5. 13. and 7. 12.
In the book of Revelation, it is often noted that the heavenly Spirits, so
soon as any occasion was offered, presently fell on their faces and gave glory
to God. and 19. 1, 2, 3, 4
They do after an holy manner rebound up and down this word, (...)
Hallelu-Iah is an Hebrew compou^d word, which signifies Praise ye the Lord.
Hallelu-Iah, one from another. Thus do they always give thanks. It well
beseems them: how can it then but well beseem us? we must endeavor to be
like them: only here lies a difference betwixt them and us, that all tears
are wiped away from their eyes, so as they have not such matter of supplication
as we have: we must mix petition and thanksgiving together: so give thanks
always, as we make supplication always: for to both these parts of prayer is
this extent to be applied: one must not exclude another: neither must either of
them exclude any other duty.

THE FOVRTH PART.
The Ground of Prayer.
. 126. Of the meaning of this phrase in the Spirit.
THe third general branch concerning prayer, is the ground from whence it
arises, and that is the Spirit. Pray in the Spirit, says the Apostle. Some
here understand the spirit of man, which is the soul and heart of a man: and
so is this phrase used, 1. Cor. 14. 15. (...).
where the Apostle says, I will pray with the Spirit, or in the Spirit. Others
understand the Spirit of God, which is the holy Ghost: and so is this phrase
used, Jude v. 20. (...).
f where the Apostle Jude says, Pray in the holy Ghost, Romans 8. 26.
and where Saint Paul says, The Spirit makes request for us. I take it, that
they which exclude either of these, come short of the Apostles meaning: for I
doubt not but he here intends both the Spirit of God and also the spirit of
man, sure I am that both may stand together, yea that both do always concur
together and cannot be severed: for without the holy Spirit of God, man cannot
pray in his spirit and heart: and whenever the Spirit of God helps us to
pray, he stirs up our spirits and hearts to pray. The spirit of man is that
especial place where the Spirit of God has his residencie.

This clause then affords unto us these two instructions.

1 True prayer is a work of the holy Spirit of God, and comes from his
motion.

2 Prayer framed by the Spirit of God, flows out of the very spirit and heart
of a man.

. 127. Of the work of the Spirit in prayer.
FOr the first, Doct. 1. Prayer a work of the holy Ghost.
note what the Prophet says in Gods name to Jerusalem, Zach. 12. 10.
I will power upon them the spirit of supplications. He calls the gifts of
prayer the spirit of supplications, because it is Gods Spirit which works in
us this gift, and inableth us to call upon God: in a like respect, Saint Paul
uses this phrase, 2. Cor. 4. 13.
The Spirit of faith. More plainly is this point proved, by that phrase which
Saint Jude uses, Jude v. 20.
Praying in the holy Ghost: but most evidently by Rom 8. 26, 27. Expounded.
Saint Paul, who lays it down, first affirmatively, saying, The Spirit
helps our infirmities, and makes intercession for us: then negatiuely,
saying, We know not what to pray, etc. What may the Apostle mean by this
phrase, The Spirit it self makes intercession? Does the holy Ghost truly and
properly pray for us, as Christ our High Priest and Mediator, or as one of us
for another? Noe verily: for then should the holy Ghost be our Mediator (which
was one of Arrius his heresies) an office which is never attributed to him, but
appropriated to Christ: 1. Tim. 2. 5.
For there is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Christ
Jesus Besides, then also should God make request to God; for the holy Ghost is
God, but not man also, as Christ was. The meaning then of the Apostle must
needs be this, that the Spirit of God stirs us up to pray, quickening, and
putting life into our dead and dull spirits, yea inwardly, as it were,
suggesteth unto us, and infuseth into us such desires, such sighs and groans,
yea and such words, as are acceptable to God, which for the truth and
sincer^^^e of them, for the vehemency and ardencie of them, for the power and
efficacy of them are (...).
unutterable: they pierce through the very heavens, and enter unto the glorious
Throne of Gods grace, and there make a loud cry in the ears of the Almighty.
Therefore Romans 8. 27.
in the next verse the Apostle adds, he that searches the hearts (that is,
God the searcher of all hearts) knows what is the mind of the Spirit (that
is, what desires, what sighs and groans, what prayers proceed from the work
of his Spirit, being stirred up thereby in our spirits) for Gods Spirit
informs, and instructs our spirits to make prayers to God, according to the
will of God, which otherwise were most impossible for us to do: we neither
could tell what to ask, nor how to ask. Thus plainly and clearly we see,
that true prayer comes from the motion and work of Gods Spirit: which may
yet further be confirmed by comparing, Gal. 4. 6. with Romans 8. 15. in that it
is said, the Spirit in our hearts cries Abba Father: in this, by the Spirit we
cry Abba Father.

The reasons why thus the Spirit prays, Why needful that the holy Ghost
help us to pray.
yea why it is needful that the Spirit should pray, and so we pray in the
Spirit, are these.

1 In regard of our natural estate, Reasons.
we have no ability at all to pray: a dead man can as well crave help of
another man, as a natural man in faith crave succor of God. 2. Cor. 3. 5.
We are not sufficient of our selves, to think any thing as of our selves.
Can we then be sufficient of our selves to pray aright?

2 In our regenerate estate we are no longer able to do any good thing, then
the Spirit helps and assisteth us. Though once we be enabled by the Spirit to
pray aright, vet if the Spirit leave us and continue not in us his powerful
work, all our ability is gone (as a wheel which is turned about with an
hand, if the hand be taken away, the wheel will soon stand still) it is
needful that unto the first grace, following grace be added: for man after he
is regenerate, still needs the present, effectual, continual work of Gods
holy Spirit. It is therefore said, Philip. 1. 6.
He that has begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of
Jesus Christ.

3 Though we knew how to pray, yet would not our prayer be acceptable to God,
except it came from his Spirit: Romans 8. 17. (...).
it is attributed as a proper work to the Spirit, that he makes intercession
according to the will of God (that is, so as is pleasing and acceptable to God)
for as God knows the meaning of the Spirit, so the Spirit knows the will of
God.

1 Here note how the whole Trinity has a work in this holy exercise of
prayer. Romans 8. 26.
The holy Ghost frames our requests. Reu. 8. 3.
The Son offers them up unto his Father. Romans 8. 27.
The Father accepts them thus framed, and offered up.

2 Note the reason, why the prayers of the Saints are so acceptable, and
available, why they pierce through the clouds, and have access to Gods throne:
they are the groans of Gods Spirit: not that the Spirit groaneth, but that our
spirits are made to groan by Gods Spirit.

3 Note what an admirable gift, the gift of prayer is, a singular gift,
peculiar and proper to the Saints, who have the Spirit of God: if 1. Cor. 12. 3.
no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost, surely no man
can call upon God, as his Father, but by the Spirit of God. Romans 8. 15.
We have therefore received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.

4 Note how we may know whether Gods Spirit be in us, and whether we be Gods
sons or no: even by the Spirit of prayer: I mean not an outward formal
uttering of words, but true prayer coming from the heart.

. 128. Of the means to pray aright in the Spirit.
THey who desire to pray aright, so as their prayer should be acceptable to
God, must,

1 Labor for Gods sanctifying spirit, which is gotten by the ministry of the
word, as was set forth by Acts 10. 44.
those extraordinary gifts which God bestowed on Christians while they were
hearing the word preached: and as Gal. 3. 2.
Saint Paul with great emphasis affirms, saying, received ye the the spirit
by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? that is, assuredly by hearing
the Gospel (which is the word of faith) preached ye received the spirit: in
which respect the preaching of the Gospel is called, 2 Cor. 3. 8
the ministration of the spirit.

2 Having the spirit we must go along with him, and follow his good motions:
pouring forth those desires which he suggesteth unto us: Leu. 9. 24.
the fire which God would continually to burn upon his Altar, came out from
the Lord. If sacrifices were offered up with any other fire, that fire was
counted and 10. 1, etc.
strange, and the sacrifices no whit acceptable, but abominable to the Lord:
the heavenly fire whereby our spiritual sacrifices of prayer must be offered
up, is that holy spirit which comes out from God: he carries the very image
of God: we must therefore Mar. 22. 21
give unto God that which is Gods.

3 We must take heed we Ephesians. 4. 30.
grieve not the holy spirit of God: which is done by 1 ^^es. 5. 19
quenching the goog motions thereof through our carelessness, or by Acts 7. 51
resisting the spirit, through our rebellion: hence is it that many of the
Saints are so dull, and untoward to this exercise: by their security and
carnality they have grieved Gods spirit, and he has withdrawn his help and
assistance.

Many hearing that the spirit makes request for us, will be ready wholly to
give over this duty unto the work of the spirit, and so never rowse up
themselves, but say, when the spirit please it will make request for me. These
grieve the spirit, because they stir not up the gift thereof.

. 129. Of prayer coming from the spirit of a Man.
2 FOr the second doctrine, Doct. 2. Prayer wroght by Gods Spirit, comes out
of man's spirit.
that Prayer framed by the Spirit of God, flows out of the very spirit and
heart of a man; it is also clear by Romans 8. 26.
the forenamed place, The spirit makes intercession with groans, etc. Now
groans proceed from the heart, and spirit, not from the tongue and lips: but
more expressly Gal. 4. 6.
the Apostle says, that the spirit which cries Abba Father, is sent into our
hearts. Hence it is that they which pray in the spirit, are said 1 Samuel 1. 15.
Psalm. 62. 8.
to power out their soul and their heart to God. The Virgin Mary (who without
all question praised God in the spirit) says, Luke 1. 46, 47
My soul magnifieth the Lord, my spirit rejoices in God.

1 The heart of man is, Reasons.
as it were, Gods chair of state, whereunto no creature can come: it is proper
to God alone; it is his Palace wherein he most delights: wherefore Gods
Spirit makes his aboade there, and stirs that up to pray.

2 The heart is a fountain whence comes every thing, good or evil:
wherefore the Spirit does especially purify and sanctify it. Yea, the heart
is as a Queen, she has a command of all the powers of the soul, and parts
of the body; and therefore the Spirit gives this gift of prayer to her.

. 130. Of discerning when we pray in the Spirit.
but from the teeth, though it be never so well framed in regard of the form
of words, and though our gesture be never so seemly, sauouring of much
reverence and humility, yet all is nothing: the Spirit of God has no part in
this work, if thy spirit pray not. Herein lies a maine difference betwixt the
manner of persuading God and man. Man may be moved with fair speeches,
enticing words, eloquent phrases, ( Act. 12. 21, 22
as the people of Tyrus and Sidon with Herod's eloquent Oration) but all the
eloquence in the World is no more to God then the lowing of an Ox, or the
howling of a dog, if it come not from the spirit. Hearty and upright prayer
is the best rhetoric to move God withal.

Amen. Yea, how often do they who utter the prayer (Ministers in the Church,
other persons in other places) tumble over words with their mouths, when their
hearts are wandering, so as little assent of spirit, if any at all has been
given to their own words? Can such sacrifices be acceptable to God? let us be
humbled for that which is past; and be more watchful over our hearts for the
time to come.

THE FIFTH PART.
The help of Prayer.
. 131. Of watching unto Prayer.
THE fourth general branch, is concerning the help of Prayer, Which is
watchfulness, noted in this clause,

Watch thereunto.]

The original word according to the proper notation of it, (...).
signifies to awake and abstain from sleep: it is properly attributed to the
body, metaphorically and by way of resemblance unto the soul. Sleep of the
body, is such a binding of outward senses, as they can not exercise their
several functions: as the eye cannot see, the ear cannot hear, and so in the
rest: Watchfulness is contrary hereunto, a keeping of the senses free and
loose, so as readily they are able to perform their functions. Thus by way of
resemblance, when the soul is so possessed and overcome with security and
spiritual sencelesnesse, as it cannot perform the duties of holiness and
righteousness, it is said to be asleep: when it rowseth up it self, and
casts away security, it is said to watch; in this sense says the Apostle, 1
These. 5. 6.
Let us not sleep as do other, but watch.

Most restrain this watching unto prayer, What watchfulnes is here meant.
to the inward spiritual watchfulness of the soul: which I will not deny to
be here especially meant. But yet I cannot think that the watchfulness of the
body is excluded: for if the body be drowsy, the mind cannot be watchful. The
Apostle by this clause would rowse up both body and soul unto prayer. The
watchfulness of the body alone is nothing: It is the spirit, the uprightness,
ardency, and cheerfulness of it, which makes prayer to be acceptable to God,
as we heard before.

. 131. Of Popish Night vigils.
RIght watching unto Prayer, is to be noted against the Night-vigils of
Papists, who place an extraordinary great point of Religion and devotion in the
observing of them. Bellarmin. de bonis oper. lib. 1 cap. 11.
Usually they make three vigils, one at the closing up of the day, and
beginning of the night. Another at midnight. The third at the closing up of
the night, and beginning of the day. In some places they have more vigils, as
some are more superstitious then others. These vigils they ground on this and
other like places, where we are commanded to watch unto Prayer; as if they who
waked to mumble over and over a few set prayers, whilst others slept, observed
this precept. For in the outward babbling of a few prayers, stands the
greatest part of their Religion. I wot well those night prayers are often
performed so drowsily, and sleepily, that it were better they were fast asleep
in their beds, then betwixt sleeping and waking so to mock God.

Object. Psalm. 119. 62.
David says, that at midnight he would rise to give thanks unto God.

Answ. He did not make it a law every midnight to rise, but occasion being
offered, he would even then rise. And so ought every Christian to do: for
this is comprised under that particle Always, or in every season. Thus Acts
16. 25.
Paul and Silas being in prison, Prayed at midnight, and and 20. 7.
Paul afterward preached until midnight: Yet did they not ordinarily use
this, nor appoint it a Law unto themselves, or others. Extraordinary actions
are not to be enjoined as ordinary things: then should we spend every day in
fasting.

I might further show many differences betwixt David, paul, Silas, their
praying at midnight, and papists prayers, but of this I spoke. 121.
before in the point of Canonical hours,

. 132. Of superstitious watching for Christ's coming.
2 RIght watching unto prayer is to be noted against a superstitious practice
of many, A superstitious waking for Christ's coming.
whom I have known to use to sit up all night at certain times of the year,
keeping themselves awake with talking one with another, playing on instruments,
singing and the like, upon a conceit that Christ will come in judgment on some
of those nights of the year, and they would not then be found asleep, but
awake, because Christ said, Mat. 24 42.
Wake for you know not what hour your Master will come.

These err many ways.

1 In that they prescribe certain set times for Christ's coming, Mat. 24. 36.
Whereas no man knows it.

2 In that they conceit he shall come in the night, which is uncertain, for
he may come as well in the day time for ough any man knows. Indeed Christ
speaking of his coming to judgment, says, Luke 17. 34.
in that night: but this word Night is taken senecdochically for day or night,
a part for the whole: and v. 20.
a little before he calls it the day, when the son of man shall be
revealed, and implies, that when he comes, men shall be eating, drinking,
buying, selling, planting, building, which are works of the day time. Yet I
will not deny but that he may come in the night time.

3 In that they imagine that they which are asleep when Christ comes, cannot
be well prepared to meet him. Whereas in truth a man that has repented him of
his sins, and with faithful prayer commends himself to God, and so goes
to sleep, is as fit in his sleep to be awaked and taken up to judgment, as if
he were in the act of prayer.

4 In that they interpret that precept of Christ, Mat. 24. 42.
wake, of bodily waking: and watching here in this text of bodily watching. But
waking and watching in these and such like places, imply not only a keeping of
the eyes, but of the heart also awake and attentive upon that which is done.

. 133 Of watching both in body and in Spirit.
TO let all these and other like erroneous conceits pass, and to return to
our matter. As outward watchfulness of the body is nothing acceptable to God,
unless the soul also be watchful, so the soul cannot possibly be
watchful, unless it have the help of the bodies watchfulness: for the parts
of the body are those Organa.
instruments whereby the powers of the soul are exercised. Wherefore both must
be joined together, as easily may be gathered out of Christ's charge to his
Disciples, Mat. 26. 41.
Watch and pray. That he speaks of bodily watchfulness is clear, for he
found them asleep, and therefore said, Watch. As clear also it is that he
speaks of spiritual watchfulness because he infers this clause, that ye
enter not into temptation: it is not bodily watchfnlnesse alone that can keep
us from temptation. Yet further this metaphor of watching has a large extent:
for it is a military word, and the Apostle still holds on like a wise
Captain to instruct Christian soldiers what to do. In time of war there
are certain appointed continually to watch in some sconce, watch-towre, or
other like eminent place, where they must rowse up themselves thoroughly that
they sleep not, and not only remain awake, but pry and view up and down
every where and discry what may be hurtful or helpful to the army. So as
watching unto prayer implies a diligent observing of all such things as may
help us or hinder us therein. In this sense the Apostle says of Ministers,
that they Heb. 13. 17
watch for the souls of their people, that is, carefully observe what may make
to the good, or what tend to the hurt of their souls.

I might out of the full meaning of this metaphor collect many particular
duties, and distinctly handle them all, but for breuity sake I will draw all
to one doctrine, which is this,

For the better performance of prayer, Doct. Both body and soul to be rowsed
up to Prayer.
both body and spirit of him who prays, is to be rowsed up, and kept from
inward and outward drowsiness, and due observance is to be made of all things
helpful or hurtful thereunto. To this purpose tend those many exhortations
which by Christ and his Diciples are made to watch. When Christ warned his
Diciples of his last Mar. 13. 37.
coming, and Mat. 26. 41
when he was in his agony he bid them watch So Col. 4. 2
Paul, so 1 Pet. 4. 7.
Peter. To this purpose also tends that patheticall speech of David, Psalm.
57. 8
Awake my glory, awake Viol and Harp, I will awake early.

. 134 Of the causes of drowsinesse.
BOth body and spirit are carefully to be rowsed up, Reason. Causes of bodily
drowsinesse.
because of our natural pronenes to drowsines, and heaviness in body and
spirit, two causes there be which cause bodily slumbering. First debility and
weakness of senses, whence it is that young children and old folks, are more
proane to slumbering then lusty strong persons. Secondly, abundance of vapors
which stupifie the senses: for fullness of meat and drink, whence those vapors
arise, Causes of spiritual drowsinesse.
make men sluggish and sleepy. Answerable there be two causes which procure
spiritual sleepiness and slumbring.

1 Weakness of the flesh (as Christ implies when he checketh his Disciples
for their sluggishnesse, 1 Weakness of the flesh.
saying, Mat. 26. 41.
The flesh is weak:) whereby it comes to pass that by nature we are
exceeding drowsy and dull, as to all good and godly exercises, so especially
to Prayer, which is the best of all. I need not further prove this then by
appealing to the conscience of every one that use this holy exercise. Many are
loath to go about it: many when they are at it, fall fast asleep, as Acts 20.
9.
Eutichus. I have heard this direction prescribed, when one cannot sleep; Say
thy prayers, and thou shall sleep: it is commonly the direction of profane
persons, spoken of sluggish prayers, (for if a man pray in the spirit with that
earnestness which he ought, it will rather keep him the longer from sleep)
but yet it shows that men are commonly dull and drowsy in Prayer. Our
spiritual sluggishnesse makes our hearts heavy, and our eyes sleepy: Again,
our bodily sluggishnesse makes our spirits more dull.

2 Abundance of bye, 2 Abundance of by-th^ghts
wandering, vain, earthly, wicked thoughts, cares, lusts, and such other
things, which like vapors arise in our souls, and which the Devil also is
very busy to cast into our hearts in time of prayer. These add much unto our
natural dullness and drowsinesse; so as in these two respects there is great
need of watchfulness.

. 135. Of going drowsily to Prayer.
LIttle do they consider the need thereof, Use 1. Such as go drowsily to
prayer taxed.
who going to prayer, are so far from rowsing up their spirits and bodies,
that they do, as it may seem, purposely set themselves to sleep: some
compose themselves to such gestures as make them sleep, they hang down their
heads, and lean them upon their arms or hands: they sit upon seats, or upon
the ground, they close their eyes, etc: Some never pray till they go to bed,
and so sleep preuenteth them: some again come immediately from their pots and
platters, or from their worldly affairs and businesses, and presently go to
prayers, without any premeditation or cogitation of what business they have in
hand. With what devotion can such prayers be performed? Is this to watch unto
prayer? The truth is, that such do but mock God.

. 136. Directions for Watchfulness.


In regard of the body, 1 Choose fit times.
first choose such times as are freest from drowsinesse; these are mornings:
for our bodies having rested all the night, and by rest being refreshed, are
the more free, ready, and cheerful to prayer. Scholars find it the fittest
times for their studies: Aurora musis amica,
and so may Christians, if they observe a difference of times, find it fittest
for their prayer. If for prayer sake we rise the sooner, we watch unto Prayer.

2 Considering that it is so needful that we pray at evening, 2 Rowse up thy
self.
which is a drowsy time, rowse up thy self before prayer; go not to it half
sleeping, half waking. Learn of the watchful Bird, Virgil. ales. Ovid Simile.
the Cock, who when he is about to crow, especially in the night time,
flappeth hi^ wings, and so beats hi^ body, and rowseth up himself to crow.
Do thou something to drive away drowsinesse stir thy body, walk, meditate,
sing a Psalm before prayer at evening. Use such gest^res as will keep thee
from drowsinesse, kneel upright, or to help thy weakness, stand. Hasten to
prayer, go not to it too late. Who do these things for prayers sake, Watch
unto Prayer.

3 Moderate thine appetite, 3 Moderate thine appetite.
and use a temperate diet, if after meat thou art to pray: sobriety is often
joined to watchfulness, as an especial help thereof. Luke 21. 34, 36.
Christ having given a warning to take heed of surfeiting, drunkenness, and
cares of this World, infers this exhortation, Watch and pray: otherwise we
cannot well watch and pray. Wherefore says Saint Paul; 1 These. 5, 6.
Let us watch and be sober. And Saint Peter, 1 Pet. 4. 7.
Be sober and watching in prayer. Who eat for prayer sake somewhat the more
sparingly, do watch unto prayer.

In regard of the soul,

1 Take heed it be not too much distracted with worldly thoughts, 4 Avoid
distractions.
Mat. 13. 22.
Cares of this World choke the Word, much more will they choke the spirit of
Prayer. He that remembering the time of prayer, disburdeneth his soul hereof,
Watches unto prayer.

2 Most especially be watchful against sin, 5 Take heed of sin.
which (as. 20.
has been showed before) like birdlime will so cling the feathers of the
soul, that it cannot fly up to Heaven. Nothing more dulleth the heart of man
then sin. He that yields thereto can hardly recover himself, and revive
his spirit again in a long time. 2 Samuel 12, 1, etc.
It was three quarters of a year before David was thoroughly recovered after
his great fall; for his child was borne before, and an extraordinary means was
used to recover him, the Prophet Nathan was sent unto him.

It was an admirable and extraordinary thing that Peter was so soon recovered.
Sins do grieve the spirit, and quench his good gift in us: the Spirit being
grieved and provoked to withdraw his presence, will not return again with a
wet finger. Especially be watchful against such sins as by nature thou art
most proane unto: for in them especially will Satan most attempt thee when thou
art going to prayer. If thou be given to lust, make a covenant with thine
eye not to cast it upon a strange woman: avoid wanton company, garish attire,
fullness of bread, and whatsoever may provoke lust: so in anger,
voluptuousness, covetousness, etc. This is an excellent point of wisdom, and
argues great watchfulness unto prayer, if for prayer sake it be done.

3 Take notice of Gods mercies and judgments, 6 Observe Gods dealing with thee.
of his blessings bestowed on thee, and of thy wants, of the estate of others,
and of other points concerning the matter of prayer. Read also some part of
Gods Word before Prayer: Thus shall thou come furnished to Prayer. This is also
to watch unto Prayer.

Many complain of their untoward performance of this heavenly duty, but
observe not the reason thereof, which is this, They watch not unto Prayer.

THE SIXTH PART.
The means of prevailing by Prayer.
. 137. Of Perseverance.
IN the last place is added an especial means of obtaining our desire by
Prayer, which is Perseverance. Pray (says the Apostle) watching thereunto with
all perseverance.

Perseverance is an holding out to do a thing till it be accomplished. What
perseverance is.
The universal particle All, adds emphasis thereunto, and shows that it
must be a patient, constant, unwearied, continued holding out. (...). Themist.
de canibus venat.
The original word is by the learned of that tongue attributed to hunting
dogs, which will not cease following the game till they have got it. A fit
resemblance, if the rule of a similitude be observed, which is to hold close to
the point in hand. To persevere then in prayer is, with long patience to
continue constantly in calling upon God, and not wax weary, or give over till
he hear us. This is manifested two ways,

1 By often praying for one and the same thing. As 2 Cor. 12. 8.
Paul prayed thrice against a temptation, that is oftentimes.

2 By a long holding out at one time, Genesis 32. 24.
as Iaakob wrestled a whole night with the Angel, and would not let him go
till he had blessed him.

. 138. Of the things which we are to ask with all perseverance.
Quest. 1. HOw often or how long must we persevere in prayer, How long we must
persevere
before we give over?

Answ. Noe certain and stint time can be limited. Some things are
continually to be prayed for as long as we live, namely those things which we
stand in need of all the days of our life, whether they respect soul or
body, and those things which shall not be accomplished so long as we live; as
a joyful resurrection and eternal salvation. These are to be prayed for in
our ordinary prayers continually. Other things for which especially
perseverance in prayer is needful, require a more particular and present
answer of God, as a temptation, sickness, or any distress which hangs over
our heads, or lies upon us, or such blessings as we stand in present need of:
these are to be prayed for till we obtain our desire, as Iaakob would not let
the Angel go till he had blessed him: or till we have some better thing in
liew thereof, as Paul prayed against the temptation, till he had grace
sufficient given to him against it, or till there be no hope of obtaining our
desire; that is, till God does evidently declare that it is his will not to
grant it, 2. Sam. 12. 20, 23.
as David continued to pray for his child while it lived, but when it was
departed, he ceased to pray for him, saying, The child being now dead,
wherefore should I now fast, can I bring him again any more?

. 139. Of the difference betwixt praying always, and with all perseverance.
Quest. 2. Was not thus much implied under the forenamed circumstance of
time, always, or in every season.

Answ. Seeing the Apostle does here set down the Doctrine of Prayer so
distinctly and succinctly, we may not imagine that he would twice set down in
one and the same verse, one and the same thing, and that in two differing
phrases. There is certainly a difference betwixt these two branches, which I
take to be especially in these two respects.

1 That is more general, having respect to the whole course of a Christians
life, that he have his set times: constantly observe them, and be ever ready on
all occasions to pray.

This is more particular, having respect to some especial occasions, that in
craving them we should be instant and urgent.

2 That respects the duty and work of prayer, that we be constant in
performing it.

This the issue and event of prayer, or the blessing which flows from it: for
it is the effect and issue of our prayer that makes us more or less
importunate: Longer or shorter to continue in prayer. If it be long before we
receive that which we desire, the longer we persevere and continue in prayer.

. 140. Of the difference betwixt perseuering and much babbling in prayer.
Quest. 3. What difference is there betwixt these many, and long prayers
implied under perseverance, and Matthew. 6. 7.
those vain repetitions, much babbling and and 23. 14.
long prayers condemned by Christ in the Scribes and Pharisees.

Answ. Very much and great: even as great as betwixt white and black, light
and darkness, sincerity and hypocrisy.

1 These many and long prayers here intimated, are proportioned according to
Gods particular dealing with us: if it be long before he grant our request, we
go the oftener unto him, and we hold out the longer in prayer.

Those vain repetitions and babblings are stinted by set and certain periods
of time appointed before hand, without any respect of Gods dealing.

2 These come from the vehemency of desire, and ardencie of affection.

Those only from the tongue and lips.

The Papists are like to Pharisees in both these. The much babbling of Papists
in prayer.
For first they measure the number and continuance of their prayers by their
set times: for which purpose they have both set forms of prayer, and also
chains of Beads to put them in mind when their stint is ended; yea they set
down so great a number of repetitions, as cannot be freed from vain
repetitions.

This name Jesus is above five hundred times set down to be repeated at one
time in their Jesus Psalter. Again, their prayers being in Latin (as I have
showed before) which tongue all that say their prayers understand not, they
cannot come from the heart, but only from the tongue.

. 141. Of holding out in prayer.
THus having cleared the meaning of this clause, Doct. Prayer to be often renewed
and held out.
observe the instruction hence arising, which is this,

Who desire to reap the fruit of their prayer, must both often renew their
prayer, and also hold on without fainting till it be heard. Romans 12. 12. Col.
4. 2.
In the word here used is this duty often urged: but most elegantly and
emphatically does the Isa. 62. 1, 6, 7.
Prophet set it forth in his own example, saying, For Sions sake I will not
hold my tongue, and for Ierusalems sake I will not rest, until the
righteousness thereof break forth as the light, etc. Again, he says of
other Watchmen, All the day and all the night continually they shall not cease.
Further, by way of exhortation, he adds, Ye that make mention of the Lord,
keep not silence, and give him no rest till he establish, and till he make
Jerusalem a praise in the earth. Christ does also excellently set it forth by
two parables, Luke 11. 5.
one of a Friend, and 18. 3.
the other of a poor Widow. The Friend was so importunate, as he was impudent
again: for so much the notation of the (...). Impudentiam, et iniquitatem, et
crudelitate^, and supinitatem frequens vincit oration. Chrysostom. in Heb. hom. 27.
original word implies. The Widow by her importunity so troubled the Judge,
as he feared he should be weary with her often coming. Mark how impudent
beggars will be, they will receive no nay: nor many who petition to the King,
Council, Lord Chancellor, Judges, and the like, and by their impudency often
obtain their suits. Impudency, taken in the best sense, as Christ uses the
word, is such an holy, constant importunity, as will take no denial. This we
may use to God, and if we use it, we shall assuredly prevail: for note what
Christ says, Luke 11. 7.
Shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him, though
he bear long with them? Particular examples of often praying for one thing, and
long holding out in prayer,. 98.
were laid down in the point of extraordinary prayer.

. 142. Of the reasons of Perseverance.
THe ground of this Perseverance is Gods wise disposing providence, Reason. Why
God often seems not to hear our prayers.
who often sets a long date to the accomplishment of his promises, till which
time come, he seems not to hear us, and yet expects that we should
solicit and ply him with our prayers, not because he needs soliciters, and
remembrancers, but for just and weighty reasons,

1 The sacrifice of prayer is a sweet and delight some sacrifice to God. Heb.
13. 15, 16.
The Apostle speaking of the calves or fruits of our lips, which are prayers
and praises, says, with such sacrifices God is pleased. Psalm. 141. 2.
In this respect prayer is called Incense: God is delighted with the prayers of
his Saints, as men with the savor of sweet incense. He loves to hear them
often praying, and long to continue, provided that the prayer come from an honest
heart and true desire.

2 God thus tries the faith and patience of his Saints, Deus idcirco non
celeriter annuit, vt tu diutius inquiras. Chrysostom. in Mat. hom. 24.
whether they can and will continue to depend upon him. Who cease to pray, cease
to wait: they withdraw themselves from God, h Gods soul will have no pleasure
in them. (Heb. 10 38.)

3 By Perseverance prayers wax more earnest and fervent. Christ often praying,
prayed the Luke 22 44. (...).
more fervently. Prayer is like to fire, which if it find fit matter, the
longer it burns, the hotter it burns. But God loves not key cold prayers:
they are as irksome to him as lukewarm water to a man's stomach. Reu. 3. 16.
God will spue them out.

4 God thus moves his children to search their hearts, to see if they can
find any cause in them why God hears them not. This was a means whereby
Ios. 7. 6, etc.
Achans sin came to be found out: yea Judge. 20. 27
by Gods denying once and twice to hear the Israelites, they were brought to
repentance.

5 God does thus commend his blessings so much the more unto us. For good
things much desired, often craved, long expected, are more welcome when they are
obtained, and we moved to be more thankful for them. Things soon obtained
are little regarded.

. 143. Of the damage of not perseuering, and advantage of perseuering.
What a vain conceit is it to think, Use 1: Reproof.
that it is in vain long or often to call upon God, if at first he hear not.
Such was the conceit of him who said, 2. King. 6. 33
Behold this evil comes of the Lord: should I attend on the Lord any longer?
This conceit cannot be free from pride and arrogancy; yea it is a disdainful
and presumptuous conceit. Yet by nature we are all too proane unto it: for we
are ready to prescribe a time unto God, and to say, So long will I continue to
depend upon him, and pray unto him; if by that time he hear not, he will never
hear. This is the cause that often we fail of the fruits of our prayers, and
fall into many temptations, giving our spiritual enemies great advantage
against us.

For our parts, Use 2. Exhortation.
let us learn how to carry our selves when God seems to reject our prayers,
even Mat. 15. 22, etc.
as the woman of Canaan, when Christ at first would not seem to hear, and
after told her plainly he was not sent to her, and the third time compared her
unto a whelpe, yet she continued praying: and what was the issue? her faith
was commended, her request was granted. Never any that perseuered lost their
labor.

As for them who have lain long under a cross, Use 3. Consolation.
let them not think their prayers are not regarded, or themselves not
respected, because at first they were not heard: we here see that God
expects perseverance.

THE SEVENTH PART.
The persons for whom Prayer is to be made.
Ephesians. 6. 19. 20. And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may
open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the Gospel: For which I am
an Ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.
. 144. Of desiring the help of others prayers.
FRom his direction unto prayer, Coherence.
the Apostle proceeds unto an especial request, that they whom he had
instructed, and incited to pray for others, would in particular pray for him:
whence observe, that

As Christians ought to pray for others, Obser. 1. Prayers of others to be
desired.
so to desire the mutual prayers of others for themselves. Seldom did Saint
Paul write to any, of whom he requested not their prayers, whether they were
whole Churches, as in this and many other Epistles, or particular persons; as
Phil. verse. 22
Philemon. This has been the ancient practice of Gods children: 2. King. 19. 4
Hezekiah desired the prayers of Isaiah, H^st. 4. 16.
Hester of the Jews, Dan. 2 18.
Daniel of his three companions: Genesis 20. 7.
God intimated thus much unto Abimelech, that it would be good for him to crave
the prayers of Abram, and Job. 42. 8.
unto Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar, that it would be good for them to seek the
prayers of Job. Did not Saint James exhort hereunto, when he says, James 5. 14
Is any sick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let
them pray for him.

. 145. Of motives to desire others prayers.
THe motives which were alleged to enforce the duty of prayer in general,
might fitly be here again applied, for prayer being a duty whereby God is
much honored, and a thing very powerful with God, and profitable to those for
whom it is made, we ought to take all occasions to stir up others thereunto.
But there are many more particular reasons to urge this doctrine: for by
desiring the prayers of others,

1 We testify our great desire of Gods blessing, Reasons.
and thereupon we think it not enough to pray for it our selves but also seek
the help of others prayers to obtain it. 1. Testifi^ation of the earnestnes
of our desire.


2 We show that we acknowledge a communion of Saints, 2. Acknowledgement of
the communion of Saints
which perform mutual duties one to another.

3 We manifest a sense of our own weakness, for the supporting whereof we
crave the help of others, yea we manifest much humility. 3. Sense of our own
weakness.


4 We maintain mutual love, which consists not only in offering, and doing
kindnesses, 4. Maintaining of mutual love.
but also craving and accepting the like: if a man do not sometimes desire,
and receive good turns at his friends hands, he will make his friend unwilling,
and ashamed to seek and receive any at his hands, and so will intercourse of
love be soon broken off.

. 146. Of the difference betwixt desiring other men's prayers and making them
mediators.
Object THus are many Mediators made.

Answ. Nothing so, for our desire is not that o^ther men should present our
persons, and our prayers to God, and so make them acceptable, which is the
office of a Mediator, but only we use them as companions, and fellow members
in this office.

. 147. Of those who use or refuse to ask the help of others prayers.




And for those who mock and scoff at it in others, what do they but strike
the Prophets and Apostles through their ^oines, whom they scoff at. The time
may come when they would be glad of their prayers, whom in their prosperity
they mocked, even as Exodus 8. 8.
Pharaoh was glad of the prayers of Moses and Aaron, 1. Sam 15. 25
Saul of the prayers of Samuel, and Act. 8. 24.
Simon Magus of Simon Peter's.

. 148. That none too good to seek the help of another prayer.
But for the better clearing of this point, I will more distinctly declare, the
persons both who are to desire this duty, and also of whom it is to be
desired.

For the first, Who are to desire others prayers.
All of all sorts, none excepted, must desire the prayers of others, not only
the younger, meaner, inferior sort, as children, scholars, auditors and the
like: but even the best and greatest, and that of such as are much inferior
unto them. Note the. 144.
forenamed examples, which show that Kings, Queens, Prophets, Apostles,
desired this kindness: what persons more eminent for place, or more excellent
for grace? if it beseemed them, whom may it not beseem?

On the one side, Reasons.
the greatest and best, while here they live are subject to many infirmities,
many temptations: and though they may have some excellent gifts above others,
yet they want many other, which meaner then they have: besides, they are proane
to decay in the graces which they have. On the otherside, the prayers of the
least and meanest Saint are of force with God: Job 34. 19.
God is no accepter of persons: it is the heart, the honesty, sincerity and
ardencie of it, which he most respects, and not the greatness and dignity of
the person who prays. Simile.
In this regard therefore, as the foot may be helpful to the head, and as a
little mouse may be helpefull to a Lion caught and entangled with cords, by
gnawing a cord asunder, so may the least Christian be helpefull to the
greatest by praying for them.

seek this help. 1. Cor. 12. 18 etc.
God in wisdom has so ordered the body of Christ, that the members thereof
should need one another prayers: and that, both to maintain mutual love
among them (for mutual prayers do even knit the souls of the Saints
together) and also to suppress arrogancy, that one should not scorn and
disdain another. If any be otherwise minded, it is to be feared that ambition
has blinded their minds.

If the greater are to desire the prayers of the meaner, much more the meaner
of greater, as children of parents, people of the Ministers, etc.

. 149. Of praying to the living only.
FOr the second, Of whom. prayer is to be desired.
the benefit and kindness of prayer is to be desired of such as we know may
know our desire. These are only the living, who converse among us upon the
face of the earth: to these, whether present or absent, we may make known our
desire: if present, by words or outward signs: if absent, by letter or message

To desire the prayers of such as are departed out of this world, Not of the
dead.
is both in vain, and also without warrant.

1 In vain, because we can neither make sign, speak, write, nor send to
them: nor can they without some such means, know the desire of our heart, it
is Gods property to search the heart.

2 Without warrant, because the whole Scripture affords neither precept,
promise nor good example tending to that purpose; had it been needful,
questionless Christ would have comprised it in his perfect form of prayer.

. 150. Of the Papists arguments for praying to the dead.
Our adversaries make show of sundry places, Arguments for praying to the dead
answered.
but such as make nothing to the purpose, but are wrested clean contrary to
the scope of the Holy Ghost. Their great champion who uses go gather together
what has been, Bellarm. de Sanct. Beat. lib. 1. ca. 19.
or may be alleged: for defense of their superstition, idolatry, and heresy,
quoteth only these distinct places out of the old Testament: Genesis 48. 16
The first is where Jacob says to Joseph, The Angel which delivered me from
all evil, bless the children, etc.

Answ. The Angel there meant, is and 32. 24.
the same with whom Jacob wrestled, which was Christ Jesus, Mal. 3. 1.
The Angel of the Covenant.

The second is that speech of Eliphaz, d Job 51. Expounded.
to which of the Saints will thou turn.

Answ. 1 Question may be made whether every speech of Eliphaz recorded in that
Book be of sufficient authority to justify a point in controversy: Quamuis
haee verba non videantur co^uincere, quia non sunt ipsius scrip toris libri,
sed Eliphaz amici Job, tamen ideo couincu^t, quia indicant tunc fuisse
consuctudinem, etc.
The Author who alleges this argument, denies not but doubt may be made
hereof.

2 The place is meant of Saints living on earth: neither does it imply any
prayer to them, but speaks of a due consideration of their estate, whether
any were like to Job.

3 Exodus 32. 13.
The third is the prayer of Moses, Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Answ. Moses means not any intercession, which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob made
unto God for their posterity; but the covenant which God made with them in the
behalf of their posterity.

Further he heapeth up sundry places both out of the old, and out of the new
Testament, wherein prayers Legimus viuentes a viuentibus inuocatos: ergo
licebit etiam nunc inuocare cosdam sanetos cum Christo regnantes.
of the Saints living are desired; and infers, that if it be meet and
lawful to call upon the Saints while they are upon earth, it must needs be
lawful to call upon the same Saints when they reign with Christ.

Answ. 1. There is difference betwixt desiring Saints to pray for us, (which
this Text, and other like places warrant) and calling upon Saints (which no
place of Scripture does warrant,) whether they be dead, or living.

2 The argument from the living to the dead follows not: because we have
warrant for the one, not for the other; and because we can make known our
desires to them, not to these:

Let us go along with God, and use such means of obtaining the blessings he
has appointed, and then in faith may we depend upon him, and expect his
blessing.

Thus much for this general point of requesting the prayers of others.

. 151. Of praying for Ministers.
OF the persons in general for whom prayer is to be made, we have spoken. 45.
etc.
before. Now we will more distinctly consider the particular person mentioned
in this place, Who are especially to be prayed for.
for whom prayers are most especially to be made: this is set down under the
Apostles person: For me, says he. Saint Paul was by virtue of his calling, a
Minister of the Gospel, even a public Minister unto the whole world, by
reason of his Apostleship: yet more particularly in those places where he
planted Churches, and where his Ministry was powerful and effectual, he was
a peculiar Minister, as 1 Cor. 9. 2.
himself says to the Corinthians, If I be not an Apostle to other, yet
doubtless I am to you: for ye are the seal of mine Apostleship in the Lord.
Among other Churches, that at Ephesus, to whom he wrote this Epistle, was
planted by him: he was the spiritual father of that people, and an especial
Minister unto them. As a Minister of the Gospel (yea and as their Minister) he
requesteth this duty, to pray for him: and so much is clear by that which he
would have them pray for in his behalf, namely utterance, and liberty to
preach the Gospel.

From this particular I may raise this general doctrine.

People are especially to be mindful of their Ministers in their prayers to
God. Ministers are especially to be prayed for.
As Paul and other Ministers have desired this of their people: so we read
that Acts 12. 5.
when Peter was in prison, Earnest prayer was made of the Church for him: and
and 15. 40.
when Paul and Sylas went forth to preach, they were commended of the brethren
to the grace of God; namely, by Prayer. Mat. 9. 38.
This did Christ give in charge, saying, Pray the Lord of the harvest that he
would send forth laborers into his harvest.

. 152. Of motives to pray for Ministers.
VVAighty motives there be to press this duty for Ministers especially.
Reasons. 1 A Ministers calling most excellent.


1 Of all callings, the Ministers is the most excellent, necessary, and
profitable: for it respects the soul ( Heb. 13. 17
for which Ministers watch) yea, the spiritual, heavenly, and eternal good of
body and soul.

2 It is of all the most difficult: 2 Most difficult.
whereupon the Apostle with great emphasis says; 2 Cor. 2. 16.
Who is sufficient for these things? difficult it is in two respects.

1 Of the work it self.

2 Of the persons who are deputed to that work.

The function of a Minister is to quicken such as a^ dead in sin: to raise up
and restore such as are fallen back again; to comfort those that are troubled
in conscience; to strengthen the weak; to encourage the faint hearted; to
confound the obstinate; to stand against all adverse power; together with many
other like things, all which are above humane strain, more then flesh and
blood can do: yet the persons to whose ministry these great works are
deputed, are flesh and blood, Ezekiel. 2. 1.
sons of men; c Acts 14. 15.
Men subject to the like common passions that all other men are, in
consideration whereof, many being called to this function, have sought to
decline it, as Exodus 3 and 4
Moses, Ier. 1. 6
Jeremiah, Ion. 1. 3.
Jonah, and others; and 2 Kin. 2. 9
Elisha, when he was to succeed Eliah, desired that the spirit of Eliah might
be doubled upon him.

3 Of all sorts of men, Ministers are most opposed against.
faithful Ministers are most opposed by Satan and his instruments: Mat. 4. 1,
etc.
so soon as Christ was publicly set apart to perform his ministerial
function, Satan set upon him in the wilderness; and ever after the Scribes,
Pharisees, Saduces, Herodians, and other limbs of the Devil, persecuted him
from time to time. Zac. 3. 1
When Iehoshua stood before the Angel of the Lord to receive his commission,
Satan stood at his right hand to resist him. When the Apostles were to be sent
forth to preach, Luke 22. 31*
then Satan desired to winnow them as wheat. The hystory of the Acts of the
Apostles, shows what storms have continually been raised against the
Apostles, while they were diligently occupied in their ministerial function:
one trouble came upon the neck of another, as wave upon wave. Other hystories
testify as much of other Ministers: our times are not without too evident
demonstrations of this point. As Christ while he lived a private life, so
others live quietly in comparison of the following times, but when they begin
faithfully to exercise their ministry, then arise the storms: for Satan well
knows that if the Zach. 13. 7.
shepherd be smitten, the sheep will soon be scattered; therefore he uses 1
Kin. 22. 31
the King of Arams policy: he bends all his forces against the Captains of
the Lords army.

4 Their failing in their duty is most dangerous. If they perish, 4 The fall of
Ministers most dangerous.
many perish with them. For they are like the Admiral ship which carries the
lantern, whereby the whole fleet is guided: if in a stormy and dark night
that sink, Simile.
whither will the rest of the navy? When Gal. 2. 12, 13
Peter stepped out of the way, many Jews, and Barnabas also went astray with
them. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2.
That very Apostle prophesying of false teachers that should bring in damnable
heresy, says, Many shall follow their damnable ways. How did Arrius in his
time seduce the greatest part of Christendom? Never were there any Ministers
corrupt in life, or doctrine, but many were drawn into perdition with them.

Are not now prayers, Use. Exhortation to pray for Ministers.
hearty and earnest prayers to be made for Ministers especially. Oh pray that
the Lord would send forth faithful Laborers: and pray for a blessing on them
which are sent forth. Do this in public, do it in private; let us your
Ministers never be forgotten. We well know the power of faithful prayer, and
the need we have thereof. You know the benefit of faithful preaching, and the
need you have thereof. We to our poor power are mindful of you. 2 Cor. 6.
11, 13.
Our mouth is opened unto you; our heart is enlarged: Now for recompense in the
same, be ye also enlarged. You reap the fruit and benefit of that blessing
which God bestows on our labors.

Hitherto of the person who is to be prayed for.

. 153. Of the things which are to be prayed for in the behalf of Ministers.
IT remains to show both what is to be prayed for in the behalf of
Ministers, and why.

That which is to be prayed for, is in one word Utterance: which is amplified,
first by the manner; secondly, by the end.

The manner is declared in two branches. First, Opening the mouth: Secondly,
Liberty of speech.

The end is to make known the mystery of the Gospel.

The reasons why the Apostle would have those things prayed for in his behalf,
are two: One taken from his Office: he was an Ambassador for the Gospel. The
other from his present condition: he was in bonds. Hereupon he repeateth again
the thing to be prayed for, (in these words, That therein I may speak boldly)
and the manner (in these) as I ought to speak.

. 154. Of Ministers inability in themselves.
ALL the things which are here set down, the Apostle desires to be given unto
him, because he well knew he had them not of himself: Here then first note,

Ministers have no ability to perform their Ministerial function, 3. Obseru.
Ministers have no ability of themselves.
except it be given them. 2 Cor. 3. 5, 6
For we are not sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves.
Our sufficiency is of God, who has made us able Ministers. Note what Christ
says to his Apostles; John 15. 5
Without me ye can do nothing. Great were the pains which Saint Paul took in
the execution of his Ministry: He labored more abundantly then all the rest:
whereby is manifested that he had a great ability thereunto, yet he says; 1
Cor. 15. 10
It is not I, but the grace of God which is with me. In this respect he says
more indefinitely of all Ministers, and 3. 7,
That neither he which planteth is any thing, nor he which waters.

I showed. 152.
before that the work of the Ministry is a divine work, Reasons.
and that Ministers are but men. Now what is man to that which is divine?

Is not this a strong motive to incite all to pray for their Ministers. Use 1:
Without Gods assistance and blessing they are nothing. Yet 2 Cor. 10. 4.
through God they are mighty.

i Cor. 4. 7.
For who makes thee to differ from another? and what have thou that thou did
not receive? Now if thou did receive it, why do thou glory as if thou had
not received it? Let such as are insolent, take heed that God take not away
their ability from them. God has so dealt with many.

. 155. Of praying for ability in Ministers.
ALL the particulars here set down for which the Apostle would have the
Ephesians pray in his behalf, may be drawn to these two heads: Ability and
liberty to exercise his ministry. Hence arises a double instruction: one for
Ministers, the other for People.

That which Ministers ought most of all to seek for, 4. Obseru.
is, that they may well perform the work of their Ministry.

2 This also is it which people ought to beg of God for their Ministers. 5.
Obseru.


Observe the several places wherein the Apostles desire people to pray for
them, and ye shall find this to be the matter of their requests. When the
Apostles were assembled to pray together, thus they prayed, Acts 4. 29.
O Lord grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy
Word.

For Ministers, Reasons.
their Ministerial function, is that particular work which God has appointed
to them, their proper Talent whereof they are to give a particular account unto
the great shepherd of the sheep: Ioh. 21. 15, etc.
and the means whereby they may best manifest their love to Christ.

For People, the Office of Ministers was appointed to gather them together,
Ephesians. 4. 12, 13.
till they all meet in the unity of faith, and knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man. In a word, Ministers by well performing their ministerial
function, do most good both to themselves, and their people. Mark what Tim.
4. 16.
Saint Paul says to Timothy, In doing this, thou shall both save thy self,
and them that hear thee.

How contrary are the desires of many Ministers to Paul's? Solomon, and say; 1
King. 3. 5.
Ask what I shall give thee, I am afraid that too few would desire ability to
do their work, but rather some great livings; others, places of dignity:
others, applause and praise of people, with the like. For these are the things
which men hunt after.

But are people otherwise minded? do they desire that their Ministers should
be able, faithful, and painful? Surely very few in comparison of the
multitude, who rather desire such as are quiet men, content with any thing,
friendly, and familiar with them, not inquisitiue into them, nor examining what
knowledge, faith, repentance, and such like graces they have: not busy in
prying into their faults, but rather winking at them; suffering every one to
follow their own delights, with the like, which are profitable neither to
people, nor Minister For by such remissness and negligence, Eze. 3. 18.
People die in their iniquity, and their blood shall be required at the
Ministers hand.

Church, or salvation of their own souls, here learn what to pray for in
their Ministers behalf: and if they have Ministers endowed with such gifts,
bless God for them. For what we are to pray for, we must also be thankful
for, when it is bestowed; as 2 Cor. 1. 11.
the Apostle implies, saying, Labor by prayer for us, that for the gift
bestowed upon us for many, thanks may be given by may persons for us. Yea, let
them most esteem, and account of such Ministers, 1 These. 5. 13
Having them in singular love for their works sake. Not like the common sort,
who best esteem good fellows and boon companions (as they speak;) such were
those Israelites of whom the Prophet Mic. 2. 11
thus speaks; If a man prophecy of wine, and strong drink, he shall even
be the Prophet of this people.

. 156. Of Utterance, what is here meant thereby.
NOw come we more distinctly to handle the particular points here laid down.

The first is, utterance.

The word translated utterance, (...).
usually signifies speech. It is taken either passiuely for that which is
spoken and uttered, or actiuely for the very uttering of that which is
couceiued. In the former respect speech and utterance is given, when God
ministers unto his servants matter to speak: according to that which Christ
says to his Disciples, Mat. 10. 19
It shall be given you what you shall speak. In the latter respect, it has
reference both to the speakers inability, (and so implies 1 Cor. 1. 5
an ability and faculty well to utter that which he is to speak) and also to
the opposition which by others is made against him (and so it signifies leave
Col 4. 3
and liberty to speak,) I take the middlemost o^ these significations to be
especially meant, which i^ an ability and faculty to utter that which is to be
spoken, yet so as the other two may not simply be excluded: for fit matter to
be uttered, and a good faculty to utter it may not be severed; abundance of
good matter without ability to utter it, is without profit, it cannot edify
another. Ability to speak well without good and sound matter is mere vanity:
it can but tickle the ear. Again, if a Minister have both these, and want
liberty, his knowledge and gift of utterance are but as candles Mat. 5. 15.
put under bushels.

. 157. Of a Ministers ability to utter what he conceiueth.
HEre then I collect, that,

It is needful for a Minister as to have matter worthy to be uttered, 6.
Obseru. A faculty of speaking is needful for Ministers.
so also a faculty well to utter it. 1 Timothy 3. 2.
He must be apt to teach. It should seem that Moses felt the want of this,
when he said; Exodus 4. 10.
I am not eloquent, but slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. And Jeremiah when
he said; Ier. 1. 6.
I cannot speak. Therefore the Lord gave them utterance.

The matter which a Minister conceiueth is only profitable to himself, Reason.
the utterance of it is that which profits others: for Romans 10. 17.
faith comes by hearing.

Little regard have they to the good of Gods Church, who spend all their days
in the University, or in some such like place of learning, to gather more and
more knowledge and understanding of divinity, but never exercise themselves in
utterance: never pray, nor use any mean, to attain thereto: no, though they
be admitted Ministers, inducted into livings, and have taken upon them the cure
of souls. Though they may know much, yet their people are not edified thereby.

But what may we say of such as want both knowledge and speech? such as the
Prophet complains of, saying; Their watchmen are blind, Isa. 57. 10.
they are dumb dogs, they cannot bark; they lie and sleep, etc. These are
the very bane of our Church, and the dishonor thereof; they take up the places
of better then themselves: they take the fleece of the flock, but feed it
not; they drive away many from our Churches, and offend more that tarry in it:
good they do to none, but much hurt, and heavy is that account which another
day they are to make unto the Lord of the Harvest; it had been better both for
the Church, and also for themselves that they had been made carters, then
Ministers of the Word.

. 158. Of Paul's gift of utterance.
TO return to our Apostle, had not he the gift of utterance? if he had, why
both he make this request? Do men pray for that they have?

Answ. St Paul had excellent utterance.
No doubt but he had an excellent and admirable utterance: for when they
preached at Lystr^, Acts 14. 12
the Gentiles called him Mercurius, whom they accounted the God of eloquence.
The many Sermons of his and Orations, and apologies, which are recorded in the
Acts, are evident demonstrations of his elegant and powerful utterance, as
also of his boldness and freedom of speech.

Object. 2 Cor. 11. 6, Expounded.
He himself confesses that he was rude in speech.

Answ. That was said not simply, but partly by way of supposition, (as if he
had said, many may, and do take me to be rude in speech; well, grant it to be
so, yet none can imagine that I am so in knowledge) and partly by way of
comparison, in regard of the foolish, vain, thetoricall flourish, and show of
eloquence, which other ^alse Teachers, and many heathen Orators made (as if he
had said; In regard of that curious verbal eloquence which many use, I deny
not but I am rude in speech.) In this respect he plainly says, 1 Cor. 2. 1.
That he came not with excellency of speech: Verse 4.
and that his preaching was not with intioing words. But for good and true
utterance, none went beyond him. Wanted he utterance when Acts 24. 25.
he made Felix and Drusilla tremble as he reasoned of righteousness and
temperance, and of the judgment to come? Or and 26. 28
when he caused King Agrippa to break out in the midst of his speech, and say;
Almost thou perswadest me to become a Christian.

. 159. Of praying for gifts bestowed.
YEt he desired that utterance should be prayed for in his behalf, Why Paul
desired utterance.
not without good reason: for well he knew, that

1 That which he had was not so perfect, but it might be bettered.

2 God could take it away whenever it pleased him.

3 He could no longer use it, then God continued to enable him.

4 No blessing could be expected by it, unless God made it powerful.

From the practice of the Apostle, and from these weighty reasons thereof I
gather,

Such gifts as God has once bestowed, Obser. 7. Gifts bestowed still to be
prayed for.
are still to be prayed for. Compare the eighth and seventeenth verses of the
first Chapter of this Epistle together, and you shall find how the Apostle
says, that God has been abundant toward them in all wisdom, and yet prays
God to give them the Spirit of wisdom. Compare the 3. and 9. verses of Colos.
1. and ye may gather as much.

they should be destitute of no needful gift, yet we see prayer is needful
for the gifts we have.

Simile.
are drowned. Many that have good gifts, perish themselves, and are a cause
that others perish with them. For son fall into gross heresies, some into a
vain kind of affectation, some forget that which once they had; some grow very
sots and dolts. By these, and many other ways does God justly punish the pride
of Ministers.

. 160. Of opening the mouth.
THe next point concerns the manner of utterance: the first branch whereof is
opening the mouth; the second boldness, which according to the original may
thus be set down; Pray for me that utterance may be given me in opening my
mouth boldly to publish etc. Or thus, With opening my mouth in boldness. This
opening of the mouth is not to be taken as a mere pleonasme or redundancy of
speech, (as when we say, I saw with mine eyes opened, or h^ard with mi^e ears
(...)) but as a special emphasis, implying a plain, distinct, audible
delivery, and that according to the literal meaning of the phrase. This phrase
is sometimes taken figuratively for a free and bold delivery of a man's mind,
(...) is more plainly expressed in the next (...) again for freedom and
liberty to speak, but that is set down in the next verse. Wherefore I take it
in the literal sense, opposed to an evil unbeseeming shamefastness, which
makes men speak whisperingly betwixt the teeth and lips, as if they were
loath to be heard.

. 161. Of delivering the Word distinctly and audibly.
FRom the meaning of this phrase I gather that,

Ministers ought to utter the Word distinctly and audibly, Obser. 8. Ministers
must preach distinctly and audibly.
so as it may be heard and understood. Isa. 40. 9.
the Prophets were commanded to cry yea Isa. 58. 1.
to cry aloud, and lift up their voice: Ier. ^. 2.
to cry in the ears of the people. Thus did Wisdom, Prou. 1. 20. and 9. 3.
She cried without, and uttered her voice in the streets.

This manifests an holy zeal in Ministers, and shows that they are not
ashamed of their function, but desirous of the good of the people. Reason.
In this respect does the Apostle use this phrase, where he says, 2. Cor. 6.
11.
O Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you. Besides, by this manner of
delivering the Word, is the ear more pierced, and the heart more affected.



As for those to whom God has given ability to open their mouths, who can
speak audibly and distinctly, so as all that are present might hear and
understand them, yet through a misconceiued shamefastness, or (I know not
what) fear of straining their voices, and spending their tongues, speak so
softly and whisperingly as few can hear them (to say the least) they show
little desire of edifying Gods people, preferring their own ease to others
good: yea they make themselves guilty of the loss of that benefit, which they
that cannot hear them might otherwise have received. I will not deny but that
men may, and many do fall into another extreme of needless clamorousnesse,
and without cause spend themselves by opening their mouths wider, and lifting
up their voices higher, then either the number of people present, or the
necessity of the matter delivered, requires: for they will utter in small
assemblies every sentence and word, yea even the quotation of places with the
highest strain of their voice that they can. As in other things, so in this
also, a good mean and moderation, guided with judgment and discretion, is to
be used.

Then especially is the mouth to be opened, when matters of more then usual
note and need are delivered. Most of all when open, notorious, scandalous
sins wherein men live and lie, and whereof they are loath to hear, are
reproved. Isa. 58. 1.
Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgressions,
says God. But the practice hereof I leave to the discretion of each wise
dispenser of Gods secrets, according as their several abilities and occasions
shall require.

. 162. Of a Ministers boldness in preaching.
THe second branch concerning the manner of utterance, is boldness, opposed to
an evil unbeseeming fearfulness. This implies an holy courage and liberty
which a Minister takes unto himself, having respect to his Master that sent
him, and the office deputed unto him, and not to the persons of men, with whose
contradictions and oppositions he is not daunted.

The notation of the original word implies as much: (...) quasi (...) a (...)
and (...)
and it shows that the boldness here meant, is a gift whereby a man dares
freely open his whole mind, and utter any thing.

Boldness, Obser. 9. Boldness needful for Ministers.
courage, and freedom of speech is needful for a Minister in the execution of
his Ministry. Often did God stir up his Prophets hereunto, as when he said to
Jeremiah, Ier. 1. 17.
Arise, speak unto them all that I command thee: be not afraid of their faces:
and to Ezechiel, Ezec. 2. 6.
Thou son of man fear them not, neither be afraid of their words, etc. Mat.
1. 22.
Christ manifested great boldness in his Ministry, for he taught as one
having authority, so as his hearers were astonished: this boldness made him so
freely rebuke Mat. 5. and 6. and 23.
the Scribes and Pharisees, and discover both the errors of their doctrine, and
the corruptions of their life: yea, and thunder out many woes against them.
Such was the boldness of his forerunner John the Baptist, as Luke 1. 17.
he was said to come in the spirit and power of Eliah. Mat 11. 14.
Great boldness did Act. 4. 13.
Peter and John show forth, and the rest of the Apostles.

Many people are impudent, Reason.
stiff-necked, fierce and violent, and will soon quail a Minister if he be
not of a bold spirit. This reason Ier. 1. 17.
God himself renders to his Prophets, to make them the bolder. Ezec. 2. 6.
We see by common experience, how every one will trample on him that is
timorous and faint-hearted? Soon will people perceive whether their Ministers
be timorous or no: if they be, they will surely tread on them. But if
Ministers be bold, men of courage, and freely declare their message, they will
daunt the stoutest hearts. For Gods word has a powerful work in it, if it be
delivered with power and courage. The Prophets and Apostles dismayed their
proudest enemies.

. 163. Of the things wherein boldness is to be showed.
FOr the better application of this point, Wherein boldness is to be manifested.
observe how and wherein this boldness is to be manifested.

1 By an equal and impartial preaching of the Word, without respect of
persons: Christ spared none: not Rulers, Priests, Lawyers, nor any other sort:
but told all of them their duty.

2 By a declaration of the whole truth of God, See more of this point,. 182.
as occasion requires, concealing no part thereof for any by respects of
favor, fear, reward, danger, or the like. Herein did the Apostle show his
boldness, for he says to the Elders of Ephesus, Act. 20. 27.
I have not shunned to declare unto you all the council of God.

3 By a grave, See more of this point,. 183.
plain, free delivery of Gods word, without affectation of popular applause:
seeking more to approve ones self to him of whom he is sent, then to please
them to whom he is sent. With great emphasis does the Apostle set forth his
boldness in this respect, saying, Gal. 1. 10.
Do I now persuade men or God? or do I seek to please men? that is, I am far
from seeking to please men.

4 By reproving sin, and Titus 2. 15.
that with authority, so as transgressors may be brought to shame (if it be
possible) and made to tremble. l Mat. 14. 4.
Thus did the Baptist reprove Herod, and and 23. 13, etc.
Christ the Pharisees.

5 By despising all shame, fear, reproach, and disgrace, which by profane and
wicked persons shall be brought upon us, for performing our calling as we ought:
it is expressly said of Christ, Heb 12. 2.
He despised the shame: and the Apostle says of himself, Romans 1. 16.
I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, and 2. Tim. 1. 8.
exhorts Timothy not to be ashamnd of the testimony of our Lord: God
commands his Prophets Ier. 1. 17.
not to fear. Ezec. 2. 6.


. 164. Of joining courage and wisdom together.
IN these, and such respects is this gift (a most needful gift) to be prayed
for: and Ministers must labor in these respects, to show their holy boldness.
Let us therefore rouse up our dull spirits, and cast off the cloakes of fear
and shame; that in truth we may say, as the Apostle did of himself and his
fellow laborers: 2. Cor. 3. 12.
We use great boldness of speech, provided that it be guided with wisdom:
wisdom and courage must be joined each to other.

Wisdom, that unnecessarily, without the limits of our calling, as
busybodies, we thrust not our selves into such dangers, as we can have no
comfort in bearing: in which respect says Saint Peter, 1. Pet. 4. 15.
Let none suffer as a busie-body in other men's matters.

Courage, that we shrink not from that duty whereuuto God has called us, to
avoid imminent danger: lest by seeking to prevent man's rage, we pull upon our
heads Gods wrath. Dan. 3. 17.
God is able to deliver us from the rage of all men: but all the world cannot
shelter us from the wrath of God.

. 165. Of Ministers seeking to edify the Church.
THe end why the Apostle desires the forenamed gifts is in the last words of
this verse, To make known the mystery of the Gospel. Every word almost
affords a forcible reason to urge them to pray for those gifts in his behalf.

1. To make known (so as they shall thereby attain to knowledge.)

2 The mystery (a thing that is not easily known)

3 Of the Gospel (the best thing that can be learned.)

In general, we may note that the end which the Apostle aimed at, in desiring
utterance, was for the edification of others: for to make a thing known, is to
instruct and edify others. Here observe,

That which Ministers aim at infitting themselves to the Ministry, must be
the edification of the Church: Obser. 10. The end to be aimed at by Ministers,
is to edify others.
1. Cor. 12. 31
they may and must desire and seek the best gifts: yea they may and 14. 12.
seek to excel, but to the edifying of the Church: expressly the Apostle
charge, that all things be done to edifying.

For this end Christ ordained Ministers, even for the edifying of the body of
Christ. Reason.


adue to all pains; and say, it belongs to them which follow them, to take
the pains which they have done. But let those, who seek to approve themselves
to the highest Master, follow this Apostle, 1. Cor. 10. 33
Who sought not his own profit, but the profit of many, that they might he
saved. Herein Romans 15. 3.
he followed Christ, who pleased not himself.

. 166. Of making known what we know.
MOre particularly in this end we may note.

1 The action (to make known.)

2 The object (the Gospel.)

3 A quality thereof ( the mystery.)

The first shows that, Obseru. 11. Things known, to be made known
It is the duty of a Minister to make known what he himself knows. In the
fourth verse of the third Chapter of this Epist^e, the Apostle implies that he
had great understanding in the mystery of Christ (which is the mystery of the
Gospel here spoken of.) Here we see that his desire is to make it known.
Thus much he affirms of himself, saying, Gal. 1. 15. etc.
When it pleased God to reveal his Son in me, immediately I went to Arabia,
namely, to preach Christ. And Christ of himself, saying, John 15. 15.
All things that I have heard of my Father, have I made known to you. As
Christ put this in practice himself, so also he commanded it to his Disciples,
saying, Mat. 10. 27.
What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in the light: and what ye hear
in the ear, that preach ye upon the house ^ops. And Saint Paul to Timothy,
saying, 2. Tim. 2. 2.
What things thou have heard of me, the same deliver to faithful men, which
shall be able to teach other also.

All the understanding of the Gospel, Reason.
which God gives to his Ministers, is a talent given them to occupy and
employ: by making known what they know, they improve their talent, they
approve themselves to their Master, they profit their brethren.

Mat. 25. 30.
an unprofitable servant) and the sentence which passed against him, which was
this, Cast him into utter darkness, etc. Let not us through negligence
conceal our knowledge, like that servant; nor through envy think much others
should partake thereof, like Ios^ah; but rather be of Number. 11. 28. 29.
Moses and Act. 26. 29.
Paul's mind, who were willing all should know as much as themselves.

. 167. Of preaching the Gospel.
THe second point shows, that The Gospel is the proper object of preaching.
Obseru. 12. The Gospel is the proper object of preaching.


What the Gospel is, I showed Treat. 2. part. 5.. 4. page 165.
before: for further proof of the Doctrine, note the commission which Christ
gave to his Apostles, when he sent them out to preach, Mar. 16. 15.
Go and preach the Gospel: in this respect Romans 10. 15.
are the feet of Preachers said to be beautiful, because they preach the Gospel

The end of preaching is the salvation of men's souls: Reason.
for 1. Cor. 1. 21.
it pleased God by preaching to save those that believe. But Romans 1. 16.
the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation: if the Gospel then be not the
object of preaching, preaching must needs fail of the maine and principal end.

Object. The Law also is to be preached.

Answ. It is so, but as a preparatiue unto the Gospel; in which respect, very
fitly says the Apostle of the Law, that Gal. 3. 24.
it was our Schoolmasters to bring us unto Christ: thus is the Law preached
for the Gospels sake; so as it remains firm, that the Gospel is the proper
and principal object of preaching.

Treat. 2. part. 5.. 4. 5. etc.
before delivered of the excellency and benefit of the Gospel, makes much
to the urging and pressing of this point.

. 168. Of the Mystery of the Gospel.
THe third point evidently declares, Obseru. 13. The Gospel is a mystery.
that The Gospel is a mystery: very often is this title and attribute used: in
other places it is called 1. Cor. 4. 1.
The mystery of God: Ephesians. 3. 4.
the mystery of Christ: and 1. 9.
the mystery of the will of God: Ma^ke 4. 11.
the mystery of the Kingdom of God: 1. Tim. 3. 9.
the mystery of faith: 1. Tim. 3. 16.
the mystery of godliness.

For God is the Author, Christ the matter of it: it declares the will of God,
and directs man unto the kingdom of God. Faith believes it: and godliness
issues from it: so as all these mysteries are but one and the same: (...)
sacris initiari.
even the Gospel here spoken: which is fitly called a mystery: for a
mystery is a divine secret. (...) necesse est (...). Steph. ex Eustath.
Mysteria ergo sunt arcana sacra.


Now the Gospel is a secret: for 1 Cor. 2. 8. 9
none of the Princes of this world knew it: it contains the things which eye
has not seen, nor ear heard, neither came into man's heart.

It is also a Divine secret: for first it could not be known, but by divine
revelation: the Apostle expressly says, that Ephesians. 3. 3.
God by revelation showed this mystery unto him, and that Ephesians. 3. 5.
it was opened unto the sons of men by the Spirit, and thus came it to be
Ephesians. 3. 10.
made known by the Church unto principalities and powers in heavenly places:
so as it was above the conceit, not of men only, but also of Angels.

2 Being opened, it seemed incredible unto all, whose hearts the Spirit of
revelation did not persuade of the truth thereof: therefore the Apostle prays
for the Ephesians Ephesians. 1. 17. 18
that God would give them the Spirit of revelation in the knowledge of Christ,
that the eyes of their understanding might belightned, etc.

In a word, of all other things it is the most abstruse: no humane invention
like it: none of the Liberal Arts and Sciences comparable to it in
profunditie. The Law is not such a mystery as the Gospel, for the Law was
ingraued in man's heart: and man does still by nature retain some glympse and
sparkles thereof: for Romans 2. 14. 15.
the Apostle says, that the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the
Law, and show the work of the Law written in their hearts. But the Gospel was
never written in man's nature: it was extraordinarily revealed, and is above
nature: wherefore 1. Tim. 3. 16.
the Apostle contenteth not himself to call it a mystery, but also terms it
a great mystery: intimating thereby, that it is a mystery both of great weight
and moment (the knowledge of nothing else can be more excellent, necessary and
profitable) and also of other things most obstruse, admirable and incredible:
so as it is (...).
without controversy a great mystery: a most certain, sure, infallible,
undeniable truth.

. 169. Of searching into the depth of the Gospel.
THe Gospel being a mystery, Use. 1. It requires study and prayer.
such a mystery as we have heard, it is not lightly, and slightly to be
passed over: it requires our best study and meditation, and it is worth the
best pains that we can take: men naturally are desirous to have knowledge of
deep and profound matters: this makes some scholars to spend much time, and
take great pains in reading the Schoolmen, because they account them
profound Authors, in regard of the many deep questions which they discuss:
others in studying Astrology, Astronomy, Geometry, and other parts of
Mathematiques, because they are accounted deep Sciences, above the common
conceit and capacity of ordinary men: there is no mystery in any Science which
men hear of, but they are very inquisitiue into it, and desirous to know it.
Lo here is a mystery of mysteries, wherein out happiness consists: so as
the knowledge thereof cannot but be most needful and behoouefull. Use we
therefore all the means that possibly we can to understand it, and to all
other means add faithful and earnest prayer to God, to give us the spirit of
illumination, that so we may the better conceive it. In studying it, let us not
measure i^ by the last of our own capacity: for it is a mystery about our
capacity: they which know it best, know it but in part: when it is opened as
clearly as can be by man's tongue, it still remains to be a mystery. Faith
therefore in this respect, must be placed above our reason, and we must
believe more then we can conceive: herein has faith a preheminency above
reason, that it is of an infinite capacity: for whatsoever God reuealeth,
faith believes, though reason cannot fatham the depth of it.

If in the mystery of the Gospel we should believe no more, then by our
reason we can discern the reason of, we should believe little or nothing. Let
us therefore have recourse to Gods word, where this mystery is revealed, and
pray to God by his Spirit to reveal it unto us.

. 170. Of the means of understanding the mystery of the Gospel.
THey who have attained to the greatest understanding of this mystery that can
be, Use 2. The knowledge of it affords no matter of boasting, but of
thanksgiving.
ought not to be arrogant, and boast thereof; as if they were of a greater
capacity, deeper understanding, sharper wit then others. For nothing in man is
available to find out this mystery. They ought rather to be thankful unto
God, who has vouchsafed such knowledge unto them, and every one, say as Christ
did unto God, Mat. 11. 25.
I give thee thanks, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou have
opened these things unto babes. For that and 16. 17.
which Christ said to Peter, may be applied to all that have any sound
knowledge of the mystery of the Gospel, Flesh and blood has not revealed it,
but our Father which is in heaven.

. 171. Of the cause of errors about the Gospel.
LEt not any be offended that so many in all ages have grossly erred, Use 3.
No marvel so many erred in it.
and broached diverse heresies about the Gospel, as Arrians, Aetians,
Ennomians, Eutichians, Mercionites, Manichees, Nestorians, Papists,
Anabaptists, Familists, and many others. For the Gospel being a mystery, it is
no marvel that many who have searched into it by their own wit, have erred
therein. Their errors have not risen from any uncertainty and variableness in
the Gospel, but from the shallowness of their own conceit. God in just
judgment has not vouchsafed to open the eyes of their understanding, but
rather (as Mat. 11. 25.
Christ said) Has hid these things from the wise and men of understanding and
also suffered 2. Cor. 4. 4.
the God of this world to blind their eyes, that the light of the glorious
Gospel of Christ should not shine unto them.

. 172. Of man's preferring other mysteries before the Gospel.
VEry preposterous is the conceit which many have of Gods word, Use 4. A
preposterous conceit to think other books co^tain more profou^d matter then the
Gospel, which is a mystery.
wherein this mystery is revealed. They account it a plain easy book,
wherein no great depth of learning is contained. And thereupon prefer other
books as more profound, to it. Vid. Bez annot. maiores in Mat. 15. v. 2. 3.
The Jews had their Talmuds, and Cabal^, in which they thought much more deep
matter was contained, then in the holy Scripture. The Turks have their
Alcharon, in comparison whereof, they lightly and basely esteem the
Scriptures. 35. Trid. Synod, omnes lib. tam vet. quan noui Test. nec non
traditiones ipsas paripietatis affectu suscipit. Ses. 4. dec. ^ Calvin. Instit.

In like account do Papists hold many of their unwritten traditions, Decrees
of Councels, Edicts of Popes, all which they equal, if not prefer unto the
Scriptures. Anabaptists also, Familists, and such like Enthuliasts, say that
the Scripture is but as milk for young nouices, but the revelations which they
receive (as they pretend) from God, are strong meat. I would this mean and
base esteem of holy Scripture remained only among such Infidels and
Heretics, as are Jews, Turks, Papists, Familists, etc. But too true it is
that it has too great place in the opinions of many both scholars and others.
Some who prefer the study and learning of Postillers and quaint writers, before
the wisdom of God contained in his written word. Thus great mysteries are of
many accounted slight matters, and mere toies are accounted mysteries. 1.
Cor. 2. 14.
The things of the spirit of God are foolshnesse to man. Let us take notice of
this egregious point of folly ( and 3. 19.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God) and know that no
learning can be like the learning contained in the holy Scripture, which
declares and 2. 7.
the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained
before the world unto our glory.

Ephesians. 6. 20. For which I am an Ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak
boldly, as I ought to speak.
. 173. Of well discharging a man's office.
THe reasons which the Apostle uses to enforce his request now follow. The
first is taken from his office, he was an Ambassador of the Gospel, or (...).
for the Gospel, namely to declare and make known the Gospel. This his
office shows that he was after an especial manner deputed, and appointed by
God to preach the Gospel. This charge being laid upon him, very needful it
was that he should have utterance with open mouth boldly to make known the
mystery of the Gospel: and because it was so needful he craves the help of
their prayers to obtain as much. From the force of this first reason I collect.

That charge which God is pleased to commit to any ones charge, ought to make
him careful in seeking, Obser. 14. Every one s^ek^ to discharge his charge.
and using all good means whereby he may be enabled well to discharge it. Thus
God having made Solomon a King, he was moved thereby above all other things to
desire 1 Kin. 3. 7. 9
an understanding heart to judge Gods people. To which purpose tends that
prayer of David, Psalm. 72. 1
Give thy judgments to the King O God, and thy righteousness to the Kings
son. But more particularly to this purpose tends Acts. 13. 2, 3
that practice of the Church, in fasting, praying, and laying hands on Paul and
Barnabas, when God had commanded that they should be separate for the work
whereunto he had called them. For why did they then fast and pray, but that
those Apostles might be enabled to do that work whereunto God had set them
apart? To this end Acts 20. 28
the Apostle exhorts the Elders at Ephesus to take heed of all the flock.
Why? because the Holy Ghost had made them ouerse^rs thereof: and Col. 4. 17
Archippus to take heed to the Ministry which he had received in the Lord: 1 Timothy 6. 20
and Timothy to keep that which was committed to him.

God will require a particular account of that particular function which he
appoints to any man: Reason.
of a King he will require an account of his kingly office, of a Prophet the
discharge of a Prophets office, and so of the rest: witness that Mat. 25. 19.
particular reckoning which was made with them that received several talents.

Wherefore let us every one have an eye to that office and function whereunto
we are deputed: Use. Every one have an eye to his particular office.
and withal observe what is most appertaining thereto, what whereby we may be
best fitted thereunto, and best enabled to perform it acceptably to God, and
profitably to others: those things let us labor after, and pray for: and in
those things let us exercise our selves. In particular for Ministers, let our
calling be always in our minds, remembering that we are Tit. 1. 7
Gods Stewards, 1 Cor. 4. 1
Dispensers of the mysteries of God, Ministers of Christ, and 3. 8, 9, 10
Gods laborers, Planters, Waterers, Builders, 1 Timothy 3. 1
Bishops, Ier. 23. 2
Pastors, Ezec. 3. 17
Watchmen, etc. That the consideration hereof, may make us well note what
belongs to the discharge of those functions, what knowledge, what pains,
what study, what utterance, what boldness, and the like gifts are needful
thereunto, that accordingly we may seek by our own and others prayers,
Obser. 15. A Ministers function is the office of an Ambassador.
and by all other good means how to be enabled well to perform our functions.
Which that we may the better do, let us distinctly consider the nature of a
Ministers function, set forth under the title of an Ambassador.

. 174. Of Ambassadors of the Word.
AN Ambassador is an especial messenger sent after an honorable manner from
some great personage: for mean men use not to send Ambassadors. If it be
demanded who he was that sent S. Paul on his Embassage, himself makes answer
in another place saying, 2 Cor. 5. 20
We are Ambassadors for Christ. Christ the great Lord and king of heaven and
earth was his Master, and sent him: in which respect he often styles himself
the 1 Cor. 1. 1
Apostle of Jesus Christ.

Quest. Was S. Paul the only Ambassador of Christ.

Answ. Other Ambassadors besides Paul.
No verily: for expressly he says in the plural number, we are Ambassadors,
which phrase he uses not as earthly Kings, or other in great place do, for
dignity sake saying, we Leo, or we Gregory command this or that: for when he
speaks of himself alone, and expresses his own proper name, he uses the
singular number, as Gal. 5. 2
I Paul say, Ephesians. 3, 1
I Paul the prisoner, Phil. ver. 19.
I Paul have written, etc.

But when he uses the plural number he speaks of others also, whom he
ranketh in one and the same order with himself, and makes equal to himself.

Quest. Who were those other? any besides the Apostles?

Answ. The Apostles were special ambassadors
The Apostles were especially after a peculiar manner the Ambassadors of
Christ: for they had their commission immediately from Christ, by Christ's own
voice and word were they sent forth: and in this respect the title of Apostle
(which in effect signifies the same thing that Ambassador does, Other
Ministers ambassadors also.
namely, Sent) was appropriated to them: yet may we not think that they were
the only Ambassadors of Christ, for then after their departure Christ should
have had no Ambassadors on earth, none who in his name and steed should offer
reconciliation unto the world, and preach the glad tidings of salvation:
certainly Christ still continued to love his Church as well as ever he did, and
is still as careful to provide all things needful for it as ever he was: he
cannot cast off the care of it. What therefore he did immediately after his
ascension by Apostles, doubtless he continued to do by other Ministers:
Ephe. 4. 11.
for when he ascended up on high, he gave not only Apostles, Prophets, and
Evangelists, who were extraordinary Ministers to continue but a while til his
Gospel were spread al abroad among the Gentiles, but also Pastors and Teachers,
who were by succession one after an other to continue till his glorious coming
unto judgment: and these also are his Ambassadors: so as this title
appertains to all Ministers of the Word, and all are comprised under that
speech of the Apostle, we are Ambassadors for Christ: which is further
evident by this title Reu. 1. 20.
Angel (which signifies a messenger) given to ordinary Ministers.

. 175. Of the dignity of the Ministry.
THis metaphor and title, Ambassador, being applied to the Ministerial
function, sets forth these three things.

1 The dignity of the Ministry.

2 The duties of Ministers.

3 The mercy of God in ordaining them to their function.

The dignity of Ministers function, is in a spiritual respect so great, as no
calling in the world can be comparable unto it. Obser. 16. The dignity of the
Ministry.


The dignity of an Ambassadors place, is greater or less, according to the
excellency of his Master that sends him. An Emperors Ambassador is
preferred before a Kings, a Kings before a Dukes, and so in others.

Now Ministers being appointed of Christ, sent by him, declaring his will, in
his name and his steed, they which know the excellency of Christ may well know
what is the excellency of a Ministers calling. Many other titles in Scripture
are attributed to Ministers, to set forth the dignity of their function, as 1
Pet. 5. 1.
Elders, Heb. 13. 17.
Rulers, Act. 20. 28.
Overseers, 2 King. 13. 14
Fathers, 1 Cor. 3, 8, 10
Planters, Builders, Reu. 1. 20.
Angels, Mat. 5. 14.
Lights, etc. Many excellent things are spoaken of you, O Ministers of the Lord:

. 176. Of the respect due to Ministers.
LEt people hereby learn how to respect Ministers: Instruction for people how
to esteem their Ministers.
we see how Ambassadors of earthly Kings are esteemed and entertained, namely,
with all the respect and kindness that may be, even as their Master should be.
Thus should Christ's Ministers be accounted of. I would not be understood (so
much to speak of outward respect) for our master is heavenly, our calling
spiritual, our message spiritual and heavenly: accordingly must the respect
be which is given unto us: which is diligently to attend unto our message,
willingly to follow our directions, to account our coming welcome, our feet
bewtifull, Gal. 4. 14
in heart to esteem us as Gods Angels, Mat. 10. 40
yea as Christ himself. For this end men must look not on our persons (for so
we are not better then others) but on our Ministry and message (for therein we
excel all others) The honor and good which in this respect is done unto us,
John 13. 20
Christ accounts as done unto himself.

. 177. Of despising Ministers.
AS for those who reproach or disgrace our calling, Use. 2. Reproof of such as
disgrace Ministers.
or abuse our persons for our office sake, they reproach and abuse our Master:
for so says our Master, Luke 10. 16
He that despises you despises me. In this respect God says of the
Israelites 1 Samuel 8. 7
they have cast me away, because they rejected his Prophets: and again, Mal.
3. 8
they have spoiled me, because they deprived his Priests of their Tithes. Can
such despisers of Gods Ministers think they shall escape just vengeance? Kings
will not pass by any disgraces and wrongs done unto their Ambassadors
unrevenged, if at least they can take revenge. But Christ is able to execute
vengeance on all that shall despise him and his, and assuredly he will so do:
Mat. 10. 15
for he has threatened as much: his Ministers are especially in the rank of
those concerning whom he has said Psa. 105. 15
Touch not mine Anointed, for he added, and do my Prophets no harm. Remember
the woeful desolation of Jerusalem, and note the cause thereof, Mat. 23. 37
She killed the Prophets, and stoned them which were sent unto her.

This Land, and the greater sort of people therein, have in these days highly
provoked the Lord by disgracing and abusing his Ambassadors: 1. Cor. 4. 13
For we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things.

. 178. Of the encouragement of Ministers against their despisers.
But let the world judge as it list, Use 3. Comfort and encouragement to Gods
Ambassadors.
according to the corrupt censure thereof, let our eyes be fixed on our Master
that sent us, and on our office deputed unto us: let the excellency of the
one, and the dignity of the other swallow up all the ignominy which the world
can lay upon us, and injury which it can do unto us: therewith we may
comfort our selves against that base esteem which the world has of us, even
for our calling sake, and against the wrong which in regard of our Ministry it
does unto us. If the dignity of our calling were duly weighed, so many would
not shun it, as do; but more would desire it, and labor to fit themselves
for it.

. 179. Of Ministers walking worthy there place.
2 THe duties which are required of Ministers by virtue of their embassage,
Duties of Ministers.
committed unto them, Obser. 17. 1 Worthy walking.
are two: one general, the other particular: that respects their
conversation; this their ministration. The general is, to carry themselves
worthy of the dignity and excellency of their place: we see that Ambassadors
of earthly kings are very circumspect over their carriage, behauing themselves
gravely, soberly, honorably, showing themselves to be men of wisdom, able to
discharge so weighty a function, and that in a double respect, namely in regard
of their own credit, and of their Masters honor. So ought Ministers of the word
to behave themselves as becomes the Ambassadors of the great Lord of Heaven:
all Christians are commanded to walk Col. 1. 10
worthy of the Lord, who has called them, Phil. 1. 27
worthy of the Gospel, whereby they are called, Ephe. 4. 1.
worthy of the vocation whereunto they are called: if all Christians, how much
more Ministers whose particular calling has an eminency above all. To this
purpose tends that exhortation of Saint Paul to Timothy, 1 Timothy 4 12*
Be thou an example of believers in word, in conversation, etc. Otherwise as
they disgrace themselves, and make themselves to be thought unworthy of their
place, yea to be despised, so also they dishonor their Master, as Hophni and
Phinias did; whereupon God said, 1 Samuel 2. 30.
they that despise me shall be despised.

. 180. Of Ministers faithfulness.
THe particular is to be faithful in delivering their message. Obser. 18. 2
Faithfulness.
Solomon implies that an Ambassador ought to be faithful, where he says,
Pro. 13. 17.
a faithful Ambassador is health, that is, procured and preserved safely to
his master, himself, and those to whom he is sent. Heb. 3. 1, 2.
Thus was the greatest Ambassador that God ever did, or could send forth, the
Apostle and high Priest of our profession Christ Jesus, faithful to him that
appointed him: and this testimony God himself gave of his servant Moses, Number.
12. 7.
he is faithful in all mine house: so have all good Ambassadors been: but
not to insist on particulars, note what Saint Paul says of the duty of all
Ambassadors whom he termed Stewards, 1 Cor. 4. 2.
It is required in Stewards that every one be found faithful.

. 181. of holding close to Gods message.
THis faithfulness consists in three especial points. Wherein a Ministers
faithfulness consists.


1 In delivering nothing but what he has received of his Master, 1 Nothing to
be delivered but what is received.
and is agreeable to his will: in this respect Christ said of that which he
delivered, Ioh. 7. 16, 17.
My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me; and further proves that he
spoke not of himself: So the Apostle, 1 Cor. 11. 13.
I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you: The Prophets to
manifest as much to those unto whom they spoke, used to prefixe before their
messages these and such like prefaces; Ier. 14. 1
The word of the Lord, Mal. 1. 1
The burden of the word of the Lord, Isa. 50. 1.
Thus says the Lord, etc. And that it may appear that this is a duty, God
gives this express charge to his Prophet, Ezekiel. 3. 17
Hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me: and Christ this
unto his Apostle, Mat. 28. 20
Teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. The
Scripture notes it as a property of false Prophets, Ier. 23. 16, 21
to speak the vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the
Lord. I have not spoken unto them, says the Lord, and yet they prophesied.

. 182. Of declaring Gods whole will.
2 IN delivering his whole message, 2 Gods whole message to be delivered. See.
163.
even all that the Lord delivers unto him. Thus much God commanded to his
Prophet, Ier. 1. 17
Speak unto them all that I command thee: and Christ to his Apostles, Mat. 28.
20
Teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: Nothing must
be concealed for fear or favor: Of this mind was Michaiah, who being desired
to speak good to the King, as the other Prophets had done, answered; 1 Kin.
22. 14
Whatsoever the Lord says unto me, that will I speak, Ier. 42. 4
and Jeremiah; Whatsoever thing the Lord shall answer you, I will declare unto
you: I will keep nothing back.

. 183. Of the manner of delivering Gods Word.
3 IN delivering his message as the Word of God: Gods Word to be delivered as
Gods Word.
This direction in general is laid down by Saint Peter, who said, 1 Pet. 4.
11
If any man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God.

That Gods Word may thus be delivered, there is required in the dispencer
thereof,

1 Gravity opposed to lightness, 1 With gravity.
and vain affectation: A wise Ambassador will not deliver his message like a
stage player; See. 163.
the respect of him from whom he is sent, the presence of them to whom he is
sent, will keep him from lightness, and childishness. Can lightness then
beseem Gods Ambassadors? Gods word is in it self full of gravity, no
lightness, no vanity in it. Saint Paul expressly requires gravity in Titus,
and not without good reason; for this will breed reverence and due respect to
their message in the hearts of their hearers.

2 Authority opposed to fearfulness, 2 With authority.
and shamefastness. Gods word has in it a divine power, and an admirable
majesty; and therefore must accordingly be delivered. This is it whereunto the
Apostle exhorts Titus, saying; Tit. 2. 15
Speak with all authority: We have an excellent pattern hereof in Christ
Jesus, Mar. 1. 22
who taught with such authority, as made his hearers astonished. That thus we
may deliver Gods Word, we must in the name of our Master, and by that
authority which he has committed unto us, urge and press that which we
deliver: this will smite the consciences of our hearers, and make them 1 These.
2. 13
Receive the Word, not as the word of men, but as the Word of God: and thus
will it work obedience in them that hear it.

3 Sincerity, 3 With sincerity.
opposed to falsifying and adulterating the Word of God, which is to mix it
with our own, or others conceits, or to fashion it to man's humor, so as it
may most please man. This was the fault which the Apostle discovered in false
Teachers, and whereof he clears himself, and his fellow Apostles, showing
withal that they were careful to use all sincerity: for thus he says; 2 Cor
2. 17, Expounded.
We are not as many which corrupt the Word of God: but as of sincerity, but as
of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. The word translated (...).
Pseudopostolos tangit humanum sensum diuinae praedicationi miscentes: vnde
Esayas ait Caupones tui miscent vino aquam. Hieron.
Corrupt or deal deceitfullie with, is a metaphorical word, taken from
deceitful Vintners, who for gain mix water with wine: whereby is showed that
Gods Word ought not to be delivered so deceitfully, but purely, and sincerely;
this is that vncorruptnesse and sincerity which the Apostle requires ( Tit. 2.
7.) For the word is in it self pure and sincere without any mixture: whereupon
Saint Peter terms it, 1 Pet. 2. 2 (...).
Sincere milk: if accordingly it be delivered, it will nourish; if it be
mixed, it may poison.

. 184. Of the end of a Ministers high calling.
1 Timothy 3. 1
If a man desire the office of a Bishop, he desires a good work. A work it
is, and requires pains and diligence: for which end they are called 2 Timothy 2.
15.
Workmen, 1 Cor. 3. 9.
Laborers, Ezec. 3. 17.
Watchmen, Ier. 23. 4,
Shepherds, Cor. 4. 5.
Servants, 1 Cor. 3. 5
Ministers, Tit. 1. 7
Stewards, etc. They who neglect the duties of an Ambassador, can receive
small comfort in the dignity of their embassage: and yet many there be who
seek to be Ministers, only as men seek to be civil Officers, for profit and
promotion sake, as is too evident by their carriage in their Ministry: they
neither care to frame their lives worthy of their place, neither are faithful
in performing the work of their Ministry, whereby they cause this honorable
calling to be vilely and basely esteemed.

. 185. How Man's Weakness is succored by the ministry of Man.
But howsoever some abuse this excellent calling, Obseru. 19. 3 Gods mercy in
appointing Ambassadors.
yet God has manifested his great mercy to his Church, in appointing men to be
his Ambassadors upon earth: for this has God done both to succor our
weakness, 1 Man's weakness succored.
and to support our faith. In regard of our weakness, we are not able to
endure the glorious presence of Gods glorious Majesty. The very Angels are not
able to endure it: whereupon Isa. 6. 2
they are said to have wings to cover their faces when they appear before
God: how then should mortal man endure it? Note the behavior of the
Israelites when they heard God deliver his Law, Exodus 20. 18
They fled, and stood afar off: They said; Deuteronomy. 5. 25
If we hear the voice of God any more, we shall die. Hereupon they made this
suit unto Moses, Verse 27.
Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God says, and do thou
declare all that the Lord our God says unto thee, and we will hear it, and
do it. This motion God well liked, and accordingly appointed sons of men to
be his Ambassadors, and to declare his will unto his people. Thus in regard of
man's weakness, are men (like to all others, Acts 14. 15
subject to the same passions that other are) ordained Ministers of Gods Word.

. 186. How Faith is supported by the ministry of Man.
ANd that greater credence might be given to their message, 2 ^ans faith
supported.
they are after a solemn and peculiar manner (set in Christ's steed, in his
name, even 2. Cor. 5. 20.
as if he himself did it) to preach peace, and to offer reconciliation: the
Gospel is the message of Gods Ambassadors: for the Apostle having relation to
the Gospel, says; Whereof (o^ for which) I am an Ambassador. So that in
respect of this function and place appointed to Ministers, Gods people may with
as strong confidence embrace and receive the glad tidings of salvation thus
brought unto them, as if God himself with his own voice did make offer of it.
Herein lies a maine difference betwixt a Minister and a private man. A private
man may have great knowledge of the mystery of the Gospel, and be able to open
and declare the sense and meaning of it: but a Minister by virtue of his office
has this prerogative and pre-eminence above others, that in Gods steed he
declares reconciliation: so that when a Minister preaches and applies the
promises of the Gospel, he does not only declare and make known Gods mercy
and goodness to poor sinners, but also is an especial means to move sinners
to believe those promises, and to embrace reconciliation with God. Is not this
a strong proppe unto our faith? does it not bring great comfort and peace to
distressed souls?

. 187. Of receiving Gods message by the ministry of man.
Reject not the offer of peace made unto you by Gods Ambassadors, Use. Reject
not the Gospel because it is preached by man*
because they are sons of men; yield not to Satan's suggestions, whereby he
labors to persuade men that whatsoever Ministers say of peace and
reconciliation, God means no such thing: but rather, seeing God has sent
them forth, and set them in his steed, Gal. 4. 14.
Receive them as Gods Angels, yea, as Christ Jesus: and 1 These. 2. 13
receive the Word preached by them, as it is indeed the Word of God, which also
works in you that believe: 2 Chr. 20, 20
Believe Gods Prophets, so shall you prosper. Whosoever lightly esteem their
Ministry, and believe not their message, they put from them the very Word of
God, and judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life.

. 188. Of the manner of Paul's being chained.
THe second reason, whereby the Apostle inforceth his request for the help of
their prayer, is taken from his present condition. He was in bonds, or word for
word, (...).
In a chain. This phrase implies that he had not free liberty, but was
restrained: restrained, I say, so as he could not go from Country to
Country, and from Church to Church, as he had done before times; yet not so as
those which are close held within the walls of a dungeon, or close prison: for
then could he not have performed his embassage, (...).
as here he expressly says he did, ( I do my embassage in a chain) then would
he rather have desired the help of their prayers for his deliverance out of
prison.

It is likely that he has reference to that time (whereof Act. 28. 16, 31.
Saint Luke makes mention) when he dwelt by himself with a soldier that
kept him, and preached the Kingdom of GOD.

Object. But there is no mention made of manicling, fettering, or binding with
chains, which seems hereto be implied.

Answ. At Rome (where Paul was a prisoner) such prisoners as were not closed up
in prisons, How Paul was chained.
but had liberty to go abroad, Lipsius in lib. Taciti 3.
had a long chain, the one end whereof was fastened to their right hand, and
the other end was tied to a soldiers left hand, so as the prisoner could go
no whether without that soldier, who was as a keeper to him. And thus it is
likely that Saint Paul was chained: for he mentions here but one chain in
the singular number: and it is said that Acts 28. 16.
Paul was with a Soldier that kept him.

Here note these distinct points.

1 The Apostles condition; he was in a chain.

2 The declaration of it. He himself makes it known.

3 The cause of his condition, for the Gospel.

4 The connection of his office and condition together.

5 The reason why here he makes mention of it.

. 189. Of the hard usage of Ministers.
1 FOr the first: Notorious malefactors were wont to be chained: Here then note
how

An holy Apostle is used as a thief. Obseru. 20. Christ's Ministers used as
malefactors.
In which respect he says, 2 Timothy 2. 9
I suffer trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds. Thus was Peter dealt
withal, Acts 12. 4. 6.
He was put in prison, and delivered to four quaternions of Soldiers, he was
bound with two chains, and lay between two soldiers, and the Keepers before
the door kept the prison. Yea thus was Christ himself dealt withal: for Mat.
26. 47. 55.
a great multitude came as against a thief with swords and staves to take him.
The like might be exemplied in many other Prophets, Apostles, Ministers, and
faithful servants of Christ: for it has been the common condition of all, in
times of persecution especially.

What might be the reason hereof? Reason.
any notorious crimes which they committed, or any unjust offense that they gave
to their persecutors? No verily. No Christian can imagine any such thing of
Christ, 1 Pet. 2. 22.
Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth. Saint Paul was ready
to do what good he could to all: for Romans 1. 14.
he held himself debtor to all, namely, in love: but hurt he did to none. The
like may be said of others, who have been so handled. They have been as
sheep very profitable and harmless: for the Spirit which comes from above
was in them, which is, Iam. 3. 17.
First pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy, and
good fruits, etc. It is therefore an evil jealous suspicion which the World
has of them, together with an inward inueterate envy and malice which it has
against them, which makes it so handle them, and that because they are not of
the World. Read John 15. 19.

Mary's days, and many that are most vilely used by the Spanish inquisition,
and other persecuting Papists in other places.

. 190. Of Paul's holy glorying in his Chain.
2 FOr the second, the Apostle himself declares and makes known this
condition wherein he was at Rome, and that under his hand by a public letter
sent to an whole Church, which was also to remain unto all Churches, to be
read of all: so that it appears he was no whit ashamed of his chain.

Persecution simply in itself is no matter of shame. Obser. 21. Persecution no
matter of shame.
Expressly the Apostle says, 2 Timothy 1. 8. 12.
that he was not ashamed of his suffering: And he exhorts Timothy not to be
ashamed of him, because he was Christ's prisoner: If any suffer as a Christian
(says Saint Peter) Let him not be ashamed, 1 Pet. 4. 16.
but glorify God in this behalf.

Nothing ought to make us ashamed but only sin, Reason.
which makes us odious before God, because it is a voluntary evil proceeding
from our selves. Now to suffer, in it self is no such matter.

our Christian Magistrates, and give us over to the power of such adversaries,
as should chain, imprison, or any other way deal hardly and ignominiously
with us; let us not thereupon think our selves, our brethren, or the Gospel
disgraced, and thereupon be ashamed of our profession: The Apostle does here
rather boast and glory in it, as some do in a chain of gold: and the
Scripture makes persecution a matter of Mat. 5. 12.
gladness, rejoicing, and Phil. 1. 29.
honor. If we should be ashamed, it would make us start back from our
profession, it would discourage our brethren, and very much hearten our enemies.

. 191. Of the cause that makes persecution a matter of rejoicing.
Quest. HOw can persecution be a matter of honor and joy? can any such thing
be in suffering? Why then should malefactors be ashamed?

Answ. As suffering in it self is no matter of shame, so neither of honor: it
is the cause for which one suffers, which alters the case this way or that
way.

The thieves betwixt whom Christ was crucified, Ibi erat Christus, ^vbi and
latrones. Similis paena, sed dissimilis causa. Aug. ser. 50. de sanc.
suffered one and the same kind of punishment, yet could one of them say; Luke
23. 14
We receive things worthy of that we have done, but this man has done nothing
amiss.

3 The third thing therefore to be considered, is the cause of S. Paul's
suffering, implied under this clause; For which, namely, for the Gospel. For
both the function, and also the condition of the Apostle has reference
thereunto, as he was an Ambassador for the Gospel, so for the Gospel he was
in a chain. Obseru. 22. The cause of persecution is that which honors it.


It is the cause which makes persecution a matter of honor and rejoicing.
Note the Scriptures wherein persecution is commended, Causa non paena facit
martyrem. Aug. epist. 61.
and ye shall find the cause either expressed, or necessarily implied: Note
Mat. 5. 11. Phil. 1. 29. 1 Pet. 3. 14. and 4. 16.

Persecution in it self separated from a good cause, is a punishment, Reason.
and a curse: a thing grievous to the flesh, and to be grieved for.

. 192. Of the things for which Men may suffer with comfort.
Quest. What may be the cause of that persecution which causes blessedness?
What is it that causes comfort in persecution.


Answ. In general Mat. 5. 10
Righteousness; and that either in abstaining from evil, or in performing of
our bounden duty. Genesis 39. 12
Joseph suffered imprisonment for refusing to commit folly with his Mistress:
Heb. 11. 25
Moses chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy
the pleasures of sins. On the other side, Dan. 6. 10
Daniel was cast into the Lions den, for praying unto God. And Mar. 3. 6
Christ was persecuted for doing works of mercy. John 5. 16


More particularly the Gospel which is here set down. The Acts 4. 2, 3
Apostles were persecuted for preaching the Gospel: Acts 9. 2
Others for believing the Gospel. Now because the Gospel is the Doctrine of
Christ, they which suffer for preaching or professing it, are said to suffer
for Christ's Mat 5. 11
sake, and for the name of 1 Pet. 4. 14
Christ: they which renounce it, are said to Mat. 10. 33
deny Christ Jesus.

Try the cause in all persecution.
whether it be indeed of that kind that by Gods Word we may warrantably, yea,
and ought necessarily to suffer for. 1 Pet. 4. 15
Saint Peter implies that there be many causes for which many do suffer,
wherein he would not have Christians to suffer, Let none of you (says he)
suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as a busy body in other men's
matters. Note how he makes not only open notorious sins, but also meddling
with other bodies matters, to be an unwarrantable and unjust ground of
suffering. This therefore is to be observed, not only against traitors,
murderers, thieves, adulterers, idolators, and such like: but also against
Separatists, Schismatikes, and all such contentious spirits, as by raising
troubles in the Church, bring trouble upon their own pates.

2 Timothy 2. 12
If we suffer, we shall also reign with Christ.

. 193. Of the Worlds vile handling of Christ's Ambassadors.
THe fourth point noted, is the connection of the Apostles function and
condition together, though he were an Ambassador, yet was he chained; and
though he were chained, yet performed he his function: for he says; ^(...).
I do my Embassage in a chain.

Hence arise two points to be noted. The first, that

The Ambassadors of the King of Heaven are more hardly dealt withal then the
Ambassadors of mortal Kings. Obser. 23. Christ's Ambassadors worse dealt
withal then others Ambassadors.
We see by experience that all sorts of Ambassadors are kindly used. The most
sauge and barbarous people that be, will not wrong an Ambassador. It is against
the law of Nations to imprison an Ambassador. Though Ambassadors be free in
delivering their message, and though their message be distasteful, yet at least
they are let go free, if not rewarded. But Christ's Ambassadors have in all
ages been very hardly dealt withal. This was it whereof Mat. 23. 37
Christ complained against Jerusalem, saying; O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which
killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee. Acts 7. 52.
And whereof Saint Stephen also complained, saying; Which of the Prophets have
not your Fathers persecuted, etc.

Object. They are not in all places, and at all times so dealt withal.

Answ. When and where it pleases God to raise up Christian Magistrates who
love the Gospel, and defend the Gospel, then, and there the Ambassadors
thereof are kept from public persecution: but yet the greater sort of people
will privately scorn them, and wrong them. And though there be always some,
who knowing and beleeling the excellency, necessity, and benefit of their
function, highly account of them, even as of the Angels of God; yet those some
are but few in comparison of the many which oppose against them. All that are
of the world will do what they can against them: And that in regard of their
message, and of their Master.

. 194. Of the causes why Christ's Ambassadors are hardly used.
1 THeir message is as contrary to the disposition of the world as can be:
Reason 1. Their message irksome.
This Ephe. 5. 8
is darkness, Mat. 5. 14
That is light. Darkness cannot endure light: nothing can be so much against
the hair (as we speak) against the heart of a carnal man, as the Gospel: it
pierces to the quick, and so makes him to fret and fume, rage and rave
against it, and the messenger thereof. For the world has a peace of it own,
wherein it is fast lulled asleep: when it is rowsed up by any messengers of
the Gospel, like a Bear or a Lion it bestirreth it self against him that
disturbeth it, and forgets all modesty and humanity. If it were a Father
that brought this light of the Gospel to a carnal son, the son would hate
and persecute the father for it: so the father the son, and one friend
another: hence it is that Christ Jesus the Author of this Gospel, is said Mat.
10. 35.
to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her
mother, etc. which is not said, to note out the proper end of Christ's coming,
but to show what follows upon the sending of the light of the Gospel to
carnal men, by reason of their wicked and obdurate hearts.

2 Their Master is indeed a great King, Reason. 2. Their Master of another
world.
John 18. 36.
but his kingdom is not of this world, if it were, his servants would surely
fight. Now because he causes none to rise up in arms to execute speedy
revenge, but suffers the wicked till the great day of reckoning, the world
fears him not, nor cares to abuse his Ambassadors.



Acts 20. 24.
the resolution which this Apostle had, they may be as loath to deliver their
embassage, as Ion. 1. 2, 3.
Jonah was.

. 195. Of Ministers using their liberty.
THe other point is, that

Ministers must take and use what liberty they can have. Obser. 24. Ministers
must use what liberty they can.
Saint Paul went as far as his chain would let him: In his chain he
preached. So likewise in prison he Acts 16. 32.
preached. Thus did Christ and his Apostles, though they were persecuted,
continue to preach: when they could not in one place, they went to another.

There is 1. Cor. 9. 16.
a necessity laid upon the Ambassadors of God: Reason.
and woe to them if they preach not the Gospel, when they may. But if
notwithstanding some restraint, they do what lawfully they may, and possibly
they can, as they manifest thereby a great zeal of Gods glory, in preferring
it before their own ease, so great shall that reward be, which their Master
will give them.

. 196. Of Ministers forbearing to preach, being inhibited.
Quest. What if Ministers be inhibited by Magistrates to preach: may they
notwithstanding that inhibition preach?

Ans. Difference must be made betwixt times of persecution (when infidel or
idolatrous, Whether Ministers inhibited may preach.
or any such Magistrates as are open enemies to Christ bear rule, who seek
utterly to suppress the truth of the Gospel, and root out the professors
thereof) and times of peace (when Christian Magistrates, who defend the Gospel,
and seek the progress thereof, govern the Church) The inhibition of infidels,
and idolaters made simply against preaching of the Gospel, because they would
have it utterly suppressed, is in this case no sufficient inhibition to bind
the conscience: it is directly and apparently contrary to Gods word. But when
Christian Magistrates inhibit Ministers to preach, it is because they think
them unfit and unmeet, either for some notorious crimes, or for some erroneous
opinions, to exercise their ministerial functions. In these cases, such as are
so inhibited, so far forth as they are inhibited, ought not to preach. Neither
are particular and private men to judge of the cause of the inhibition, whether
it be just or unjust: but as they who are appointed by the present government
to ordain Ministers, are to judge of their fitness thereunto, so likewise of
their unfitness.

Again, difference must be made betwixt the kinds of Ministers which are
inhibited to preach. Some were ordained immediately by Christ Jesus, and
particularly commanded by him to preach: all the world could not silence such:
though they were inhibited, yet ought they not to be sile^t, if at least they
were not forcibly restrained. Wherefore, we read that Act. 5. 40, 42.
the Apostles notwithstanding they were commanded by the Priests and Rulers of
the Jews to preach no more, yet continued to preach: Amos 7. 12. etc.
the like may be said of the Prophets, who were extraordinarily appointed by
God. Other are ordained by the hands of men, even of the Governors of the
Church. Now as they have power to ordain Ministers, when they judge them fit
for that place, so they have power to deprive Ministers, when they judge them
unfit for that place, and therefore obedience must be yielded to their
inhibition.

. 197. Of Ministers needless forbearing to preach.
But to return to the point, Persecution is no sufficient cause to make a
Minister cease preaching; rather then not preach, he ought, as Paul did, preach
in a chain, if he may have such liberty as Paul had.

How will they answer it unto their Master, Use 1*
who upon mere surmises and needless fears abstain from preaching: not much
unlike to a sloathfull man, that being to go about his business, says, Prou.
22. 13.
A Lion is without, I shall be slain in the street? such ought to be a
Ministers forwardness in performing his embassage, that he do his uttermost
endeavor, till he be directly and necessarily hindered.



. 198. Of praying for Ministers restrained.
5 FOr the last point, the reason why the Apostle here mentions his chain,
is the rather to stir them up to help him with their prayers, that he might
both be assisted by God, in doing what he did, and also, if it pleased the
Lord, have greater liberty to do more good. The word in the former verse, and
in this verse also translated bold speaking, signifies also liberty to speak.

From the force of this reason, I observe,

The more Ministers are restrained, Obser. 25. Ministers restrained to be
prayed for.
the rather ought prayer to be made for them.

It should seem that the Apostle, when he wrote to the Hebrews, was some way
or other hindered, so as he could not then come to them, whereupon having
desired them to pray for him, again he desires them Heb. 13. 19.
somewhat the more earnestly to do so, that he might be restored to them more
quickly: but most clear is this by the practice of the Church, when Saint
Peter was clapped up close into prison, Act. 12. 5.
earnest prayer was made of the Church unto God for him.

Prayer is the best means that can be used in this case: Reason 1.
the most powerful with God, Acts 12. 7. etc.
the least offensive to men. Note the issue of the Churches prayer for Peter.

There is also greatest need of the best means in this case, Reason 2.
and that in regard of the loss which the Church sustaineth by the restraint
of faithful Ministers.



. 199. Of the need of boldness.
THe Apostle having used those two forcible reasons to move them to pray for
him, returns again to the matter, and repeateth the thing which he would
have them pray for in his behalf, namely, that he may speak boldly, which he
amplifieth by the manner, as he ought to speak.

The word which the Apostle uses in this latter place somewhat differs from
the former, that is a (...).
Nowne, this a (...)
Verb: yet in effect they imply one and the same thing. This repetition of
this point shows, that

Boldness and freedom of speech is very needful for a Minster: Obser. 26.
Boldness needful.
The Holy Ghost repeateth not things in vain: wherefore that which has been
delivered concerning this point, is the rather to be regarded. That which the
Scripture again and again urges, we must not lightly pass over, but give
the more diligent heed thereunto.

. 200. Of Paul's jealousy over himself.
IN that upon the mention of his chain Saint Paul renews his desire of this
point, namely, that he may speak boldly, as if he had thus said; Because I am
chained, I do the rather desire boldness of speech: I note four commendable
virtues in him.

1 An holy jealousy which he had of his own weakness. Obseru. 27. Four
commendable, virtues in the Apostle.


2 An earnest desire of well performing his function.

3 An invincible resolution to hold out to the end.

4 A strong affiance in the power of God.

1 For the first, 1 His jealousy of his own weakness.
he was not ignorant that an iron chain, a keeper continually by one,
restraint of liberty, and fear of greater danger, were grievous to the flesh,
( Heb. 12. 11
For no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous) that
they might be means to dant the freest spirit, and to make the most courageous
fearful, that he himself was flesh and blood, that there needed more then
flesh, even Gods Spirit to uphold a man, to make him bold to perform his duty
in a chain: wherefore though yet he were not danted, yet he desires Gods
help in regard of his present affliction to support his spirit, and keep him
from fainting.

. 201. Of Paul's desire well to perform his function.
2 For the second, 2 His earnest desire of well performing his function.
such was his desire of courage and boldness to perform his function as he
ought, that being in a chain, he desires rather still in his chain so to
do, then to be freed from his chain. For one would have thought that being
afflicted, he should most of all have desired the remouall of the affliction:
but he preferred that before this: as is more clear and evident by that which
he said to the Elders of Ephesus, when he took his farewell of them; Acts 20.
24.
I count not my life dear unto my self, so that I may finish my course with
joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the
Gospel of the grace of God.

. 202. Of Paul's constant resolution.
3 For the third, 3 His invincible resolution
though he had suffered much, yet as yet he had not Heb. 12. 4.
resisted unto blood: though his liberty were restrained, yet his blood and
life were preserved; therefore he still continues to fight the Lords
battle, and to maintain his quarrel: In a chain he preached, and still
desires boldly to preach, yea, though it were in a chain. Does he not herein
manifest a brave spirit, an undaunted mind, an invincible courage?

. 203. Of Paul's steadfast Faith.
4 FOr the fourth, 4 His strong affiance.
assuredly he believed that God was able to give him courage and boldness,
notwithstanding his chain, and mauger the fury and rage of all his enemies, or
else would he not have desired boldness, now that he was in the power of his
adversaries: but well he knew that they which chained him, were chained by his
Master Christ Jesus, who Ephe. 4. 8.
led captivity captive: so as they could no further restrain him then his
Master permitted them; and he was not ignorant (for himself said it) that 2 Timothy 2. 9.
though he himself suffered unto bonds, yet the Word of God was not bound:
they chained his body, but they could not chain Gods Word.

. 204. Of the excellency of the four forenamed Virtues.
BEhold here a rare example: Use:
rare for the excellency, and rare for the scarcity of it. Admirable virtues
were these, worthy our imitation.

1 They who maintain in them such an holy jealousy, fearing lest through the
weakness of the flesh they may be danted with affliction, will be the more
watchful over themselves, more earnest with the Lord in prayer to assist and
uphold them, and more desirous of the help of others prayers, as Saint Paul
here was: such have been found to stand out to the last cast steadfastly, when
proud crackers have been quailed.

2 To desire while a man is under the cross, rather to preach boldly, then to
have the cross removed, argues a great zeal of Gods glory, and a true desire
of the progress of the Gospel, and edification of the Church: for thus he
prefers these before his own ease, liberty, yea, and life too.

3 Constancy is that which sets the crown upon a man's head. They who after
they have endured some trials, shrink in their heads, and give over the fight
before their life be ended, loose the glory of their former valor.

4 But to be persuaded, that God is able to enable his servants in all
distresses and difficulties to do that work whereunto he sends them,
notwithstanding their own weakness, and their adversaries power, will make
men not fear what can be done against them, but still hold on unto the end.

. 205. How most men's disposition is contrary to Paul's.
THus we see what rare and excellent virtues these be. But alas they are too
rare and scarce among men: as appears by their contrary disposition: For

1 Many after they have endured some small trials, grow so insolent thereupon,
that they think they can never be moved, and so forget God, and care not to
seek help and assurance from him.

2 If they call upon him, it is rather for deliverance from that present
cross, in regard of their own ease, then for any ability to honor God, or
do good unto his Church: when men are any way afflicted, they account
deliverance from it a great happiness, and therefore above all desire it: Oh
that I were at liberty, says the prisoner: Oh that I were in my Country, says
the captive: Oh that I had health, says the sick man: and I wealth, says the
poor man.

3 So far they are from resisting unto blood, and enduring till death, that
so soon as Mat. 13. 21.
persecution arises for the Gospel, they are presently so offended and
affrighted that they 2 Timothy 4. 16.
forsake their profession.

4 They so dread their adversaries power, and so doub^ of Gods almighty power
and good providence, that they think it in vain to call upon God.

The want of the forenamed graces in most men, ma^keth them to be the more
admirable in them who hau^ them; and it ought to move us to seek the more
careful after them.

. 206. Of the necessity of preaching boldly.
THe last clause is this, as I ought to speak: which some take to be set down
by the Apostle as a further motive to stir them up to pray for utterance and
boldness of speech in this behalf, because it was his bounden duty, necessity
was laid upon him, he ought so to speak: whence may be observed that,

It is not a matter arbitrary for a Minister to preach the Gospel, Obseru. 28.
To preach the Gospel boldly a necessary thing.
and that boldly, but a necessary thing. 1 Cor 9. 16.
Necessity is laid upon me (says the Apostle) and woe unto me if I preach not
the Gospel. As much may be said of all Ministers: Their offices require as
much, the charge is committed unto them. They who do it not, omit their
bounden duty: wherefore every slight occasion should not be an hinderance to
them.

. 207. Of preaching after a right manner.
But I take this clause rather to declare the manner of preaching, then a
motive to preach: and to have reference both to his function, and also to his
condition: that he may so speak as becomes an Ambassador, and so also as
becomes one which was in bonds. Hence first note that,

It is not sufficient for a Minister to preach, Obseru. 29. The Word to be
preached after a right manner.
unless it be done after a right manner: What is required unto the manner of
preaching I showed before: the point in general is again urged by this
Apostle, Col. 4. 4. And by Saint Peter saying, 1 Pet. 4. 11.
If any speak let him speak as the oracles of God. Thus in other functions
does the Apostle require aright manner of performing them. Romans 12. 8.

The same Lord who requires the duty it self, Reason.
has prescribed the right manner of performing it, so as our obedience and
faithfulness is declared by the one, as well as by the other.

In the duties which we perform, let us carefully observe how they ought to
be performed, if at least in the performance of them we desire to be
accepted. Little is this in regard by many: for to insist in the point in hand,
how loosely, how coldly, how trudely do many preach the Word? as if it were
enough only to preach. Again others fall into an other extreme: they preach
the Word too curiously, too conceitedly, too vainly, with too great
affectation and ostentation. Little does God regard such pains: little comfort
can Ministers reap thereby.

. 208. Of a Ministers carrying of himself according to his present estate.
Again, Obser. 29. Ministers must carry themselves according to their present
condition.
the Apostle implies that,

A Minister in bonds must have respect to his present condition, accordingly to
carry himself: as he may not by his timorousness betray Gods truth: so
neither by his indiscreete and ouer-great boldness endanger the same. This
does Christ imply under that general precept, Mat. 10. 16.
Be wise as serpents, and innocent as doves. Doue-like innocence will keep us
from all fraudulent dealing, so as we shall not deceive our Master, and abuse
that trust which he puts in us. Serpent-like wisdom will make us prevent
many mischeefes, which otherwise through rashness we might fall into. Such
wisdom used the Counsel at Jerusalem, when they did forbear to be too
violent against all the rites of Moses Law, because of the multitude of Jews
which believed, and permitted Acts 15. 29.
Abstinence from blood, and from that which was strangled: yea it may be
probably collected that Saint Paul Act. 19. 9, 10.
while he continued, by the space of two years disputing in the school of
Tyranus which was at Ephesus, preached not particularly against Diana, though
in general he persuaded the people that verse. 26.
They are no Gods which are made with hands, and also verse. 8.
persuaded the things which concern the kingdom of God. For certainly there
would have been many tumults raised against him, and the Church (as verse. 24,
25, etc.
through the malice of Demetrius a siluer-smith there was afterward) if by
name he had inueighed against Diana.

That thus we may, Use. Pray for the spirit of wisdom.
when we are in our enemies power, speak as we ought to speak, we are to
Ephe. 1. 17.
pray for the spirit of wisdom, that we may Phil. 1. 10.
discern things that differ, and that we may rightly judge of all
circumstances (as are Time, Place, and Persons, with the like) and accordingly
behave our selves. That promise which Christ made to his Disciples (saying Mat.
10. 19, 20.
When they deliver you up, it shall be given you in that hour, what ye shall
speak: for it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
speaks in you) and that which more generally he made to all that call upon him
aright (namely, that Luke 11. 13.
God will give the Holy Ghost to them which desire him) These and such like
promises may assure Gods faithful Ambassadors, that the Lord their Master
will give them understanding how to deliver their embassage, if at least they
seek to Romans 12. 3.
understand according to sobriety, and be not too preposterous, following the
apprehension of their own conceit, rather then the direction of Gods word.
Act. 4. 29.
O Lord grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy
Word, that so thy name may be the more glorified, and thy Church edified. Amen.

A TREATISE OF THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST.
. 1. Of the occasion that Christ took, to declare the sin against the holy
Ghost.
THE Sin against the holy Ghost, is most plainly and fully laid down by
Christ in his Recrimination, and just censure of the Scribes and Pharisees, who
maliciously slandred and blasphemed the clear evidence which he gave of his
Divine power in dispossessing a Devil, that made the party whom he possessed
both blind and dumb. Matthew. 12. 22.


Their blasphemous slander was, that Christ cast not out devils but by
Beelzebub, the prince of Devils. Verse. 24.


This slander does Christ first remove, by showing that it was neither
probable, nor possible, that by Satan should Satan be cast out.

Not probable either in the thing it self, or in their opinion who said it.

Not in the thing it self, Verse. 26.
because then should Satan be divided against himself: which is no way
likely, for so should he procure his own ruin: as is proved by an induction
of three particulars, one of a Kingdom, Verse. 25.
another of a City, the third of an House, neither of which if it be divided
against it self can stand: so nor Satan.

Now what probability is there, that Satan an old, politic, experienced
Prince, as desirous as any other, to maintain his own Power and Dominion,
should wittingly seek his own ruin and overthrow.

Nor in their own opinion was that which they said of Christ probable; Verse.
27:
because they otherwise thought of other men that cast out devils. Their own
children (men bred and brought up among themselves) that cast out devils, as
Christ did, were not by them thought to cast out devils by the power of Satan,
but by the finger of God. Is it then likely, that in their consciences they
thought that which they uttered with their tongues, that Christ cast out Devils
by the Prince of Devils?

That it was not possible, that by Satan, Satan should be cast out, Verse. 29.
Christ proves by that superior power which he casts one our, must have
over him that is cast out: he must be able first to bind him, and then to
spoil his house. But Satan has not a superior power over himself: It is
impossible that Satan should be stronger then Satan.

Thus our Lord Christ having clean quenched the fire of that blasphemous
slander (for a slander cast on him that is innocent, is as a firebrand put
into water) and by his just apology stopped their black mouths, so as they
had not to oppose against that he said, he sets forth the high pitch of
their impiety, which proceeded to plain blasphemy against the holy Ghost:
and from thence takes occasion to declare the vile nature, and fearful issue
of that sin.

Two Evangelists record the Sum of that which Christ delivered, concerning
the sin against the holy Ghost, I will therefore set down the text out of
them both.

Matthew. 12. 31, 32. Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the holy Ghost, shall not
be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it
shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaks against the holy Ghost, it shall
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come. Mark. 3.
28, 29. Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of
men, and blasphemies, wherewith soever they shall blaspheme. But he that shall
blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, has never forgiveness, but is in danger of
eternal damnation.
. 2. Of the inference of Christ's censure upon their slander.
THE forenamed Recrimination, and censure which Christ gave of the Scribes and
Parisies, is in these words; very sharp indeed it is, but most just. The
reason thereof is intimated by Saint Matthew, in the particle of inference set
down in the first place (Wherefore) and expressed by Saint Mark, (...).
in the reason which he lays down in the last place (because they said he
had an unclean spirit.) Very brazen-faced and impudent they were, that durst
openly utter such a vile slander against all probability and possibility, yea
against their own judgment and opinion, and therefore Christ thought it not
meet to spare them any whit at all. Whence learn, that

As sinners wax bold and impudent in sin, Doct. 1. The sins of impudent
sinners are to be plainly discovered.
so is the hainousuesse and fearful issue of their sin to be discovered.
Isa. 58. 1.
Cry aloud (says the Lord to his Prophet) spare not: show my people their
transgression, and the house of Iaakob their sins. Titus 1. 13.
Rebuke them sharply, says also Saint Paul to Titus. They who are acquainted
with the histories of the Prophets, of Christ, and of his Apostles, cannot be
ignorant of their holy zeal, in laying open the fearful estate of notorious
sinners, even to their very faces.

Thus, Reasons. 1 This may be a means to reclaim them.
if they be not past all recovery, they may be brought to some compunction and
remorse, Act. 2. 37.
as the Jews were upon Peter's laying forth the heinousness of their sin in
crucifying the Lord Jesus. This reason does Saint Paul allege, where he
advises Titus to reprove the Cretians sharply; Tit. 1. 13.
for he adds this clause, that they may be sound in the faith.

If those sinners themselves, 2 Others may be warned thereby to take heed of
the like sins.
whose estate is so laid forth, be obstinate, and will not thereby be any whit
moved, nor brought to remorse, but rather wax more impudent (as these Scribes
and Pharisees, like the Jews their forefathers, Ier. 44. 16.
who said to Jeremiah, As for the word which thou have spoken to us in the name
of the Lord, we will not harken unto thee: and of whom the Lord said to
Ezechiel, The house of Israel will not hearken unto thee, Ezec. 3. 7.
for they will not harken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and
hardhearted) yet may others be kept from going on in their course, and from
growing to their degree of impudency, as is noted of some in Malachies time,
Malac. 3. 16.
who observing the stoutnesse of their fellows against the Lord, feared the
Lord.

If none at all be wrought upon by the knowledge of their sin, 3 They are
made more inexcusable: and God more justified
then are they made the more inexcusable: and Gods severe proceeding against
them is the more justified. Thus much Daniel declares in his confession unto
God, Dan. 9. 5.
where first he says, We have sinned and committed iniquity, and have done
wickedly, etc. then he adds, neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the
Prophets: Verse. 6.
whereby he implies that the Prophets declared their sins, and denounced
Gods judgments against them: and thereupon he infers, Verse. 7.
O Lord, Righteousness belongs unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces.



. 3. Of the resolution and several heads of the text.
TO pass from the Occasion and Inference of Christ's censure, note further the
Manner Matter thereof.



Christ's manner of setting it forth, is with great ardency and authority, noted
in the Preface prefixed before his censure (Verily Isay unto you.) The particle
of asseueration (Verily) declares his ardencie: his auerring of it in his own
name (I say) shows his authority.

The matter of Christ's censure is 1 Generally propounded. 2 Particularly
applied.


In the general proposition is noted 1 The Nature. 2 The Issue. of the sin
censured.



The Nature thereof is declared by the person against whom it is in special
directed, namely, against the Holy Ghost.

The Issue of it is, that it shall never be forgiven.

Both these are amplified by comparing them with the Nature and Issue of other
sins.

Other sins are committed against the Son of Man. This against the Holy
Ghost.

Other sins shall be forgiven.

This shall never be forgiven.

In this comparison is set forth a lively representation of Gods Mercy and
Justice.

Of his Mercy in forgiving every sin committed against the Son of Man.

Of his Justice, in vouchsafing no pardon to the sin against the Holy Ghost.

. 4. Of the truth and weight of the points here delivered.
THe first point to be noted is Christ's Preface: whereby he shows, that what
he delivers concerning this point, is both a certain and infallible truth:
and also a point of weight and moment. Christ auerreth it upon his authority
and credit. I say (says he) I that am a faithful and true witness, I who
cannot lie, I who am the very truth, I say. So as, of what authority our Lord,
the eternal Son of God is, this which he has here delivered is also, namely,
true, Mar. 13. 31.
certain, infallible, unchangeable, Heaven and earth shall pass away, but his
word shall not pass away. With this authority does Christ Mat. 5. 22, 28, 32,
34, 39, 44.
often ratify and confirm that exposition which he gave of the Moral Law: and
opposes it to the light credit of the ancient Doctors of the Jews, saying,
You have heard it said of old, etc. But I say unto you, etc. so as his
authority is more then any others can be, for Christ is the only true Doctor
of the Church: as he himself testifies of himself, Math. 23. 8.
saying, One is your Doctor, even Christ. He has power in his own name, by his
own authority to deliver any thing to his Church: which power is intimated
under this imperial phrase (I say.) And herein his manner of teaching is
different from all others. For the usual phrases of the Prophets were, Isa.
56. 1.
Thus says the Lord: Ier. 2. 1, 4. Mal. 1. 1.
The word of the Lord: The burden of the word of the Lord: with the like. To
make doubt of any thing which Christ says, is to call his authority into
question. If therefore the word spoken by the Prophets was steadfast, how much
more steadfast is the Word spoken by the Lord himself, Christ Jesus?

The particle set by Saint Mark before the clause of Christ's authority, is in
the Greek Amen, and in the Hebrew signifies Truth, and so not unfitly
translated Verily. It is a note of an earnest and vehement asseueration. Hereby
then we are given to understand, that the truth here delivered is a weighty
truth: not lightly to be regarded, and slightly passed over. For he which
gave this commandment (Let your communication be yea, Mat. 5. 37.
yea, nay, nay) would never have added this vehement asseueration, if there had
not been need thereof.

The reason why Christ first used this Preface, was to move them who heard it,
to give the greater credence, and the more diligent heed to that which he
delivered, lest at any time they should let it slip. And it is thus recorded by
the Evangelists, that we which read it, or hear, should know that the points
here delivered are worthy our due and serious meditation: points needful to
be taught and learned.

. 5. Of Gods mercy in forgiving sin.
CHrist having raised up the attention of his hearers, by the forenamed
Preface, in the next place he mollifieth the severity of Gods justice against
the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost, by declaring the riches of his mercy, in
respect of all other sins, in these words, All sins shall be forgiven unto
the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they blaspheme. And
whosoever speaks against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him.

The mercy of God here propounded, consists in the forgiveness of sin:
the greatest evidence of mercy that could be given.

It is further amplified:

1 By the kinds of sin set down both generally (all sins, all manner of
sin) and particularly (Blasphemy).

2 By the persons that commit sin (sons of men) and among them (whosoever).

3 By the person against whom the sin is committed (the Son of Man)

The first and general point here to be noted, Doctr. Sin may be forgiven.
Mat. 1. 21.
is that Sin may be forgiven. A point well known to all that know the end
of Christ's coming, (which was, to save sinners) and the true scope and intent
of the Gospel, 1. Tim. 1. 15.
which was to mitigate the rigor of the Law, that says, Cursed is every one
that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to
do them. Gal. 3. 10.
All the Sacrifices under the Law prefigured the truth of this Doctrine: and
the many promises of the Word both in the old and new Testament, together with
the manifold performances thereof to poor sinners, do abundantly confirm the
same.

The true proper reasons hereof are, Reasons. Ezekiel. 33. 11.
the mercy of God (who desires not the death of sinners) and the Sacrifice of
Christ, whereby the Justice of God is satisfied: in which respect Christ is
said to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. Heb. 9. 26.
So as there is nothing in the sinner to move God to pass by his sins, but
only the sweet concurrence of mercy and justice in God.

Admirable is the comfort which hence arises to poor sinners. Use. Consolatio
to sinners.
Sin makes the creature to be most wretched and cursed. By reason thereof he
is odious in the pure eyes of God: yea he is liable to the infinite wrath of
God, and to all the fearful fruits thereof, which are all the judgments and
plagues which can be inflicted on body or soul in this world, and a cursed
death at the departure out of this world, and eternal torment and torture in
the world to come. Now then what comfort can be ministered to such a creature so
long as he lies under sin? The very thought of the nature and issue of sin
is like that hand writing which appeared to Belshazzer, Dan. 5. 6.
and changed his countenace, and troubled him, so as the joints of his loins
were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. But what comfort and joy
will it bring to the conscience of such a sinner, to hear the voice of Christ
say unto him (as to the poor palsy man which was brought before him) Son be
of good comfort, Matthew. 9. 2.
thy sins are forgive thee? Lo Christ has here indefinitly, without respect
unto any particular person, said, that Sin shall be forgiven.

Let our care therefore be to seek for pardon: Use. 2. Instruction. Seek for
pardon.
and not despair, and sink down under the burden of sin. The pardon is
purchased and granted; let not us reject it, or neglect it. 1. John 1. 9.
If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

Behold here a sure ground of repentance, Use. 3. Admonition. Turn from sin.
and a strong motive to stir us up to forsake our sins. If there were no
hope of pardon, what encouragement could the sinner have to turn from his
sins? for his heart would thus reason, Indeed I am a weefull wretch through
sin: but what will it now boot me to leave my sin? my judgment is past:
there is no recalling of it: there remains no pardon. But assurance of pardon
makes him to alter the case, and thus to reason, Though I have heretofore been
so wretched, as by sin to implunge my self into endless misery, yet I
hear that there is pardon for sinners: surely I will no more continue in this
woeful estate, I will seek pardon for sin past, and be watchful against sin
for the time to come. Were there no hope of pardon of sin, man would no more
care to turn from sin, then the Devil does. This point therefore of the
remission of sin, must be urged as a means and motive to draw men from their
sins, and to work in them true and sound repentance. That repentance which
arises from faith in the pardon of sin, and is performed in way of
gratefulness unto God for his great mercy in pardoning our sins, is the
most kindly wrought, and will prove the truest, and best repentance.

. 6. Of the extent of Gods mercy in pardoning all sins.
SO far reaches the goodness of God in forgiving sin, as there is no
sin (except that only which is here excepted, The sin against the Holy
Ghost) but comes within the Compass thereof. All sins (as Saint Mark has
recorded Christ's speech) All manner of sin, (as S. Matthew has recorded it)
shall be forgiven: not as if in the issue and event, every sin should indeed be
pardoned (for then few men should be condemned, which is contrary to the curret
of the Scripture, that says, Few shall be saved) but because every sin is
pardonable. Mat. 7. 14.
The point then here to be noted, is that (except before excepted) No sin in
the nature thereof is irremissible: original corruption, and actual
transgressions: whether few or many: light or heinous: new bred, or old and
inueterate: only once, or often committed; on ignorance or against knowledge:
voluntarily or by force: of infirmity or presumption: against God or man;
without a man's body, or against his own body: in secret or openly: by
omitting or slightly performing that which is good: all may be pardoned. For a
particular proof hereof, take the example of Manasseh, who (I think) went the
furthest in sin that ever any did since Adams time, and received pardon. Of
his original corruption no question can be made: that his actual
transgressions were many, and those most heinous bloody, crying sins,
committed not on ignorance only, 2. Chro. 33. 1, etc.
but against knowledge, voluntarily, presumptuously, against God and man, the
history recorded of him apparently shows: Verse 13.
and yet were they all pardoned.

The reason hereof may not be sought in the party that sins, Reason.
or in the nature of sin (for every sin is mortal, and deserves eternal
condemnation). Romans 6. 23.
In either of those no reason at all can be found out: But only in the extent
of Gods mercy, and in the all-sufficiencie of Christ's sacrifice. For the mercy
of God is greater, not only then any one, but then all sins whatsoever: and
the sacrifice of Christ is a sufficient price of redemption for all: 1. John 1.
7.
His blood cleanses from all sin. As Gods mercy and Christ's sacrifice are the
cause of pardoning any one sin: so the riches of Gods mercy, and the infinite
value of Christ's Sacrifice, are the cause of pardoning all sins.

Object. Why then is not the sin against the Holy Ghost pardonable?

Answ. Not because it is greater then Gods mercy, or above the price of Christ's
oblation, but because of Gods revealed determination against it, as we shall.
27.
hereafter more distinctly hear.

man's destruction is of himself: Ose. 13. 9.
either because he maliciously despiteth the Spirit of Grace, or wilfully
rejects the offer of pardon. In the order of redemption God has made man's
sin pardonable, but man by his impenitencie makes it not to be pardoned.

fly to the Throne of grace for pardon, how many soever, or how great soever
our sins have been. Note the gracious inuitation of the Lord by his Prophet,
saying, Come now and let us reason together: Isai. 1. 18.
though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow, though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. Whenever the Devil seeks to
bring us to despair, either by the multitude or by the heinousness of our
sins, let us in faith plead this before God, All sins shall be forgiven:
and thereupon apply to our souls the blood of Christ, which cleanses from all
sin: and be moved thereby to turn from all.

. 7. Of Blasphemy, how heinous a sin it is.
THe particular sin, whereby the forenamed mercy of God in forgiving sin,
is exemplied, is Blasphemy. For in Saint Matthew, Blasphemy is expressly added
to all manner of sin that shall be forgiven: and in Saint Mark it is said,
that All blasphemies wherewith soever men shall blaspheme, shall be forgiven.
Whence are offered two Doctrines to our consideration.

1 Blasphemy is a most heinous sin.

2 Blasphemy may be forgiven.

The former Doctrine is implied by the particular mention of it in this place.
For in that Christ gives this as an instance and evidence of Gods rich mercy,
in forgiving al manner of sin, because he forgiueth Blasphemy, he gives us
thereby to understand, that Blasphemy is one of the most notorious sins, a
sin which is most hardly forgiven, which yet notwithstanding being forgiven,
we may well hope that other sins may be forgiven.

The truth of this Doctrine will yet more clearly appear if we consider the
nature of Blasphemy.

Blasphemy (according to the notation of the Greek What blasphemy is.
word) fignifieth (...).
to hurt ones fame, or credit: yea in Hebrew also a blasphemer of God is said
(...) transfigere no men Jehouae.
to strike through the name of Jehovah.

In former ancient times this world, Leu. 24. 16.
Blasphemy, has bin used to set forth the dishonor and disgrace that is done
to man's name and credit, in which sense it is also sometimes used in the new
Testament: as where Saint Paul says of himself, and other Ministers of the
Gospel, Being defamed, (...). 1. Cor. 4. 13. (...).
(or (word for word to translate it) being blasphemed) we pray: and where Saint
Jude says of the wicked in his time, They speak evil of (or they blaspheme)
dignities: Yet now long use in Gods Church has appropriated the word
Blasphemy to an high dishonor done to the great name of God: and that both in
regard of the Matter, and also of the Manner, whereby Gods name is dishonored.

In regard of the matter of Blasphemy, God is blasphemed two ways: either
Priuatiuely, by taking away from God that which is due unto him, and wherein
his honor consists: or Positiuely, by attributing that unto him, which is
unbeseeming his Majesty, and dishonorable to his great name.

The honor due to God is taken from him two ways.

1 Simply, when that which properly belongs unto him is denied him. Thus
because the King of Ashur denied that God was able to save Jerusalem, and to
deliver it out of his hands, 2. Chro. 32. 17.
he is said to blaspheme the Lord God of Israel.

2 By consequence, when that which is proper to the Creator, is attributed to
the creature: thus the Scribes and Pharisees imagining Christ to be a mere
creature, Mat. 9. 3.
and not thinking that he was God, because he took upon him to forgive sins
(which is a power proper only unto God) accused him of Blasphemy: and again,
the Jews went about to stone him for Blasphemy, because (as they allege) he
being a man, Ioh. 10. 33.
made himself God. Though their censure of Christ were most false and
slanderous, yet thereby they plainly show what was accounted blasphemy. But to
make this point more clear, the Holy Ghost expressly says of the Israelites in
the wilderness, that they committed great blasphemies, Neh. 9. 18.
because they said of the molten Calfe which they set up, This is thy God which
brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt, whereby they attribute to the Calfe,
a creature of their own making, that which God the Creator of all things did.

The other kind of blasphemy, in attributing such things to God which are
unbeseeming his Excellency, is noted in those Israelites that caused their
sons to pass through the fire, making God thereby like unto the Devil, to
delight in man's blood: a thing most dishonorable to the Divine Majesty. The
Lord having relation to that Heathenish and barbarous fact of the Israelites,
says to their children, Ezekiel. 20. 27.
In this have your Fathers blasphemed me. Thus it is noted of those on whom the
Vial of Gods wrath was powered out, Reu. 16. 11.
that they blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains: their blaspemie,
without question, was that they impeached God of injustice, unmercifulness,
cruelty and such like things, much unbeseeming his glorious name.

In regard of the manner of blasphemy, when any thing is spoken of God, or to
God ignominiously, reproachfully, disgracefully, contemptuously, or the like.
Gods name is blasphemed thereby: Exodus 5. 2.
as when Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord that I should hear his voice, etc. And
when Iehoram, King of Israel said, 2. King. 6. 33.
Behold this evil is of the Lord, what should I wait for the Lord any longer?
And when Nebuchadnezzar said, Dan. 3. 15.
Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? And when the wicked in
Jobs time said, Job 21. 15.
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we
have, if we pray unto him?

By the several ways wherein men blaspheme God, we may observe that this sin
of blasphemy is directly derogatory to the honor of Gods name, which ought not
to be taken in vain, but rather had in all high account, and therefore a most
heinous sin. Which does further appear by that fear which the Jews had of
naming it. Blasphemy seemed so horrible a thing to them, that when a man was
to be openly accused thereof, they did not say in their public accusation,
such an one blasphemed, but ironically such an one blessed God; under the name
of that virtue comprising the contrary vice. In imitation hereof, Iezabel, when
she would have Naboth put to death, thus frames the indictment against him,
(...) 1. King. 21. 10.
Thou did bless God: and accordingly the witnesses gave this evidence,
Naboth did bless God. (...) Verse. 13.
Both she and they meant that he blasphemed God: and so was their meaning
taken: for thereupon they put Naboth to death.

The capital punishment which by Gods Law was to be inflicted on blasphemers,
does also declare the heinousness of the sin: (the words of the Law are
express, He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord shall be put to death). Leu.
24. 16.
But much more that heinous censure which the Apostle denounces against
blasphemers, 1. Tim. 1. 20.
saying, I have delivered them unto Satan, that they might learn not to
blaspheme. To this purpose says the Canon, Blasphemus secundum legem est
decapitandus, secundum canonem anathematizandus Can. paenit. 3^.
A blasphemer according to the Law is to be beheaded, according to the Canon to
be accursed.

Lastly, the practice of the Devils and other damned in hell, which is, To
blaspheme the great God who cast them in thither: directly contrary to the
practice of the glorious Angels and blessed Saints in heaven, which is
continually to sing Hallelu-iaeh, praise and glory to God, shows that
blasphemers remaining blasphemers without repentance, are far from having a
part in the heavenly society of Saints and Angels, and can expect nothing but
to have a part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone.

Thus by the very nature of blasphemy, as also by the temporal, spiritual,
and eternal punishment of it (all expressly noted in the Scripture) we see that
it is a most heinous sin: so as Christ might well bring this as a pregnant
proof of the riches of Gods mercy in pardoning al manner of sin. For if
blasphemy be pardoned, what sin may not be pardoned?

By the heinousness of this sin, Use 1. Reproof of Papists blasphemies.
learn to judge of that supposed Vicar of Christ, or rather plain Antichrist,
the Pope of Rome, and his parasites. If ever the name of Blasphemy might be
written on the forehead of any, it may be written on the forehead of that
Seuen-headed scarlet-colored Beast, which has opened her black-mouth to
blaspheme the God of heaven, and the Savior of the world, more then ever any
Pagan. What a blasphemous speech was that of Julius the third, to say, If God
were angry with ADAM for eating an apple, might not he be angry with his
Cook for eating his Peacock? And at another time, when his Physician kept away
from him a dish which he liked well, but was hurtful to his health, he said,
Bring me my dish in despite of God. The blasphemy of Leo the tenth was more
odious, because it seems to be more serious, for when Bembo his Cardinal was
speaking of the glad tidings of the Gospel, he answered, What profit does that
fable of Christ bring us? O intolerable blasphemy! But not to insist on
particular speeches of particular men, many of the Decrees made of their Popes
are very blasphemous, whereof take for a taste these particulars.

The Pope of Rome is a God. In Decretal.
Let no man dare say to the Pope What do thou. The Pope may dispense against
an Apostle. The Pope may change the nature of things. The Pope may make
something of nothing. The Pope may dispense above Law. The Pope of injustice
may make instice.

Yea, many of their public Prayers are also in the highest kind blasphemous
against Christ, as where they pray to Christ to bring them to his Father
through the intercession and merits of Peter, Paul, Thomas, Nicholas, Gregory,
and other whom they account Saints: and where they pray to the Virgin Mary to
use her motherly authority over her Son, and to command him to do this, and
that.

The power of Absolution which they give not only to the Pope, but also to
every Priest, is blasphemous: for. 14. De Absol. cap. 6. can. 9.
by the Council of Trent it is decreed, not to be a ministerial declaration,
but a judicial act of forgiving. The conceit of offering up Christ's glorified
body by the hands of a Priest, is also blasphemous: and so is the new
Jesuitical invention of mixing the milk of the Virgin Mary with the blood of
Christ. These and such like blasphemies cannot proceed but from the Impes of
Antichrist.

Blasphemy being so heinous a sin, Use 2. Exhortation to Magistrates to
punish blasphemers.
Magistrates, who are gods on earth, ought to use all the means they can to
suppress it: and therefore they ought both to make severe laws against it, and
also strictly to look to the due execution of those laws: otherwise the unjust
Judges in Ahabs time, 1. King. 21. 13.
who condemned innocent Naboth to death, for a mere pretense, and unjust
accusation of blasphemy; and the Jews who supposing that Christ blasphemed,
John 10. 33.
were ready to stone him, shall rise up in judgment against them: much more
shall that Heathen King condemn the^ who made a decree, Dan. 3. 29.
that whosoever should speak any blasphemy against God, should be drawn in
pieces, etc. Yea their practice in censuring and punishing those who speak
evil of Dignities, and that severely (wherein they do that which is just and
equal) shall condemn their remissness in suffering blasphemies against the
great and glorious name of God to go unpunished.

And let every particular Christian take heed, Use. 3. Admonition to take heed
of blasphemy.
that the Devil never prevail so far over him, as to use his tongue as an
instrument to blaspheme God. For avoiding whereof, let us retain a reverend and
high account of the great name of God in our hearts: and be afraid to conceive
an evil thought, which may tend to the dishonor thereof: much more fearful
let us be of taking his name in our mouths vainly, and of rash swearing by
his name. Common swearing by the name of God, will soon bring us to plain
blasphemy.

Yea, Use 4. Direction to give no occasion to others to blaspheme.
seeing blasphemy is such an high pitch of iniquity, let us give no occasion
unto others to blaspheme Gods name. They who call upon the true God, and yet
depart not from iniquity, who profess the truth of the Gospel, and yet turn
the grace of God into wantonness, who make show of Religion, and yet deny the
power thereof, who severely judge others, and yet themselves do the same
things, cause the name of God to be blasphemed among the enemies of piety and
sincerity. Read for this purpose, Romans 2. 17, 18. etc. whosoever give
occasion to the enemies of the Gospel to blaspheme God, the Author of the
Gospel, for their unworthy walking therein, make themselves accessory to this
great and grievous sin of blasphemy: and accordingly shall be judged with
the judgment of blasphemers.

. 8. Of Gods mercy in forgiving blasphemy.
THough blasphemy be so heinous a sin as has been declared, yet Christ
here expressly says, that Blasphemy shall be forgiven; so as from hence we may
gather, that

Blasphemers are not utterly excluded from all hope of pardon. Doctr. A
blasphemer may be pardoned.
Instance Saint Paul, who thus says of himself; I was a blasphemer, but I
obtained mercy.

Thus the Lord shows that the salvation of man is as dear and tender unto
him as his own name: 1 Timothy 1. 13. Reason.
the piercing and striking through of his own name does not provoke him to cast
the blasphemer into hell, but his pity rather moves him to offer pardon, that
so the blasphemer beholding Gods goodness striving with his wretchedness, may
be ashamed of the foulness of sin, and brought to repentance for it.

Have we not just cause in this respect to wonder, Use 1 Admiration of Gods
mercy.
and say; O the depth of the riches of the mercy of God!

Hearken to this o ye blasphemers of the name of God, Use 2. Exhortation for
blasphemers to repent.
though the great flying Book of Gods curse be gone forth against you, yet may
it be called in again. Note for this purpose what Saint Paul says of Gods
mercy to him, who had been in former times a blasphemer: Zac. 5. 2, 3. 1 Timothy
1. 16.
For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show
forth all long suffering for a pattern to them, which should hereafter believe
in him to life everlasting. Cease therefore to blaspheme any more. Lay hold of
this Gospel, this glad tidings of reconciliation, and be moved thereby to
seek how you may best honor his name, whom in former times you have
blasphemed.

And let all of us herein show our selves children of our Heavenly Father, Use
3. Imitation to bless them that curse us.
in bearing with such as have sought our disgrace. This is an hard lesson to
learn: for man accounts his name more dear the his life, and had rather his
head or heart should be stricken through, then his name and honor. Hence is it
that the least reproach and disgrace causes the greatest revenge that can be
thought of. But this humor arises from corrupt nature. Christ commands to
bless them that curse us: Mat. 5. 44.
which precept the Apostles put in practice; for of himself, and of others
says Saint Paul, 1 Cor. 4. 13.
Being defamed, we entreat.

. 9. Of the principal Object of Gods mercy, Man.
AS the riches of Gods mercy is in general commended by forgiving all manner
of sin, even blasphemy; so in particular it is commended unto Man, by making
him the peculiar object of this mercy of God: for to man does Christ in
special appropriate it, saying; All manner of sin shall be forgiven unto
MEN, (as Saint Matthew records it) To the SONS OF MEN (as Saint Mark sets it
down.) From whence we may gather, that

MAN is the most principal object of Gods mercy. This instance of forgiving
sin, goes beyond all other that can be given to commend the mercy of God;
especially if we consider what was done to effect this.

To discharge man of that debt whereunto he stood bound through sin unto the
justice of God; What was done to obtain forgiveness for man.
the Son of God must come down from Heaven, and become a son of man, and in
man's room and steed he made sin, offering himself up a sacrifice to
satisfy Gods justice for man's sin. And that man might be made partaker of
that which Christ did in this kind, Sons of men must be united to the Sonnne
of God, by the Spirit of God; that as by the former union God and man became
one person, so by this latter union, the sons of men, and the Son of God,
might make one body, 1 Cor. 12. 12.
which is, Christ.

No creature but Man does partake of Gods mercy in this kind: insensible, and
unreasonable creatures are not subject to sin, nor yet to the eternal
punishment of sin, because they have no immortal souls. The good Angels
never sinned, and in that respect had no need to taste of this kind of mercy:
whereupon when an Angel brought the news of Christ's birth, Luke 2. 10.
he says in the second person, To you, is borne a Savior: but when the
Prophet a son of man foretold thereof, Isai. 9. 6.
he says in the first person, To us a child is borne, To us a Son is given.
The evil Angels, that had as much need thereof as sons of men, Jude v. 6.
are reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judgment of
the great day. This mercy is not vouchsafed unto them, in regard whereof it is
said, that Christ took not on him the nature of Angels, Heb. 2. 16.
but he took on him the seed of Abraham. In this respect we may with an holy
admiration cry out, Psalm. 8. 4.
and say; What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
that thou visitest him?

The reason why God should thus respect man above all other creatures, cannot
be fetched out of man. Man has his being from god as well as other creatures;
in his nature there is no such excellency, as for it he should be preferred
before all others: Genesis 2. 7.
for he was made of the dust, and in his substance much inferior to the
Angels; neither can there be any merit or desert in his actions: for in his
best estate he could do no more then what of duty he was bound unto. But
when God afforded him this great mercy, whereof we now speak, he was dead in
sin, a slave of Satan, an enemy of God. It was therefore Gods good pleasure
that made him thus to make choice of man, to make him the most principal
object of his mercy; and in this respect the Apostle uses (...).
a word, which signifies a proper, and peculiar love to man. Tit. 3. 4.


How does this check the sons of men for their ungratefulness against God?
Use 1. Reproof of man's ungrate fullness.
whereas this proper and peculiar love of God to man, should provoke him to
exceed all other creatures in setting forth the honor and glory of God, who
has so respected him: Man for the most part dishonors God more then all
other creatures, except the infernal spirits, who wholly and only set
themselves to dishonor and blaspheme the name of that great God, who reserueth
them in everlasting chains. For if we look into the highest Heavens, there
we shall see the heavenly Spirits stand before the Throne of God, ready to
receive and execute any charge that he shall give them: yea, there we shall
hear them singing continually praise unto the Lord, and rejoicing when God is
any way glorified in Heaven or in earth. Do any of the sons of men so far
exceed the Angels in glorifying God, as Gods mercy has more abounded to us
then to them? What we shall do in Heaven I know not, but how far short the
best of us on earth do come of them, none can be ignorant. Descend we
therefore a little lower into the next heavens, where we may behold the Sun,
Moon, Stars, and whole host of those heavens keep constantly that fixed
order and course which at first their Maker appointed them: yea, the Moon in
her changes, and the very wandering Stars in their wandering, observe the
decree of the Creator, and start not from that order which he has set unto
them; and yet the sons of men daily transgress the Ordinances which the Lord
their God has given them. The very earth which was cursed for man's sake, with
little tillage brings forth all manner of needful and pleasant fruits for
man: yet all the spiritual culture which God uses on the sons of men,
cannot make many of them bring forth good fruit. Read Gods complaint to this
purpose, in the long which was made to the Vineyard of the Lord. Isa. 5. 1, 2.
etc.
The Prophet Isayah notes that the Ox and the Ass (two of the most brutish
creatures that be) take better notice of the kindness of their Masters, Isa.
1. 3.
then the Sons of Men do of the mercies of the Lord to them.

Oh beloved, Use 2* Exhortation to excel all creatures in obedience.
let this perverseness of our nature humble us, and let us endeavor to
answer with gratefulness Gods goodness to us. As he in mercy has abounded
toward us above all other creatures, so let us strive to excel all in
honoring him. Though notwithstanding our uttermost endeavor we come much
short, yet let our true desire mount aloft, and let us still endeavor to go
as far as possibly we can, and even moan again, because we cannot attain
to the perfection of the most perfect. This is that which is intended in the
third petition of the Lords prayer, Thy will be done in earth as it is in
Heaven.

. 10. Of Gods impartiality in offering mercy without respect of persons.
GOds mercy to Man is further amplified by the generality of the Object, which
is first intimated by these indefinite words, Men, and Sons of Men: and then
more expressly noted by Saint Matthew under this general particle ( Whosoever)
whereby we are taught, that

God excludes none from the participation of his mercy.

1 This doctrine is to be understood of Gods outward dispensation and
manifestation of his mercy by the ministry of the Word, Doct. In what respects
pardon is offered to all.
wherein no difference is made betwixt persons, nor exemption of any; so as it
calls not into question the secret counsel, and eternal decree of God.

2 It is to be referred to the several degrees, sorts, and conditions of men,
betwixt which God makes no difference, as honorable, mean, rich, poor,
learned, unlearned, old, young, free, bond, male, female, Magistrate, subject,
with the like.

3 It is to be applied to the all sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, which is
auailable to take away the sins of the most notorious sinners that can be (as
we heard. 6.
before) as well as of any other sinners.

Thus this doctrine rightly taken, is abundantly confirmed throughout the whole
Scripture. Prou. 1 21. and 9. 3, 4.
Solomon brings in Wisdom in the open streets, proclaiming mercy to all: Mar.
16. 15.
and Christ commands his Apostles to Preach the Gospel to every creature:
meaning every reasonable creature capable thereof. But more particularly and
expressly says the Apostle; Romans 10. 12.
He that is Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him. 1 Timothy 2. 4. 6.
And again, God will that all men shall be saved: and Christ gave himself a
ransom for all men.

For with God there is no respect of persons; Reason. 1.
he has not carnal eyes, nor sees as man sees: the souls of the meanest
are as dear and precious to him, as the souls of the greatest: Ezec. 18. 4.
All souls are mine, says the Lord.

. 6.
before, that man's destruction is of himself. No man can justly blame God, who
offers mercy and pardon to every one.

Let every one of what rank or condition soever he be, Use 2 See more nerof 2.
Treatise of Faith.. 29.
be encouraged to apply to himself this glad tidings of pardon: and seeing God
excludes none, let not any of us exclude our selves.

. 11. Of the title SON OF MAN given to Christ.
THe last branch whereby Gods mercy in forgiving sin is amplified, respects
the person against whom the sin is committed in this phrase ( Son of Man).

This title in Scripture is used sometimes indefinitly, To whom this title, Son
of Man, is attributed.
and sometimes determinatly.

Indefinitly, in a double respect.

1 To set forth all mankind in general, 1 To mankind in general.
and so it compriseth under it every son of Adam, every mothers child (as we
speak). In which sense Bildad uses it, where comparing mankind with the
celestial bodies, he says, How much less MAN a worm, even the SON OF MAN,
a worm? Job 25. 6.


2 To design corrupt and wicked men, 2 To wicked men.
in which sense it is opposed to sons of God: as where Moses says, that the
sons of God saw the DAVGHTERS OF MEN: Gen 6. 2.
and David his complaint, I lie among them that are set on fire, even the
SONS OF MEN. Psalm. 57. 4.


Determinately and particularly it is attributed to the Prophets of God, and to
Christ the Son of God.

In the old Testament it is most usually attributed to the Prophets, 3 To
Prophets.
especially when it is expressed in the singular number. Among other Prophets
Ezechiel is most frequently styled with this title, SON OF MAN: he is in his
Prophecy so called almost an hundred times. The reason whereof I take to be
this, He had visions both more in number, and more rare in kind, revealed unto
him, then any other Prophet had: now lest he should be exalted out of measure
through the abundance of revelations, the Lord often puts him in mind of
his estate by nature, that he was but a son of man, a mortal man, even a
worm.

In the new Testament it is most usually attributed unto Christ, 4 To Christ.
and that most frequently in the history of the Evangelists, and when Christ
speaks of himself. Once Saint Stephen terms Christ the Son of Man. Act.
7. 56.


This title has relation especially to the humane nature of Christ, In what
respect Christ is called Son of Man.
in regard whereof he was borne of a woman, and so a true Son of Man: yet is
it not to be restrained only to his Manhood; for it compriseth under it the
person of Christ, God and Man: else how could Christ while his humane nature
was on earth say, The Son of Man is in heaven. 1. Ioh. 3. 13.


The reason why this title is given to Christ, Reason why Christ is called
Son of Man.
is not, (as some too nicely infer, from the singular number) because Christ
was borne of a Virgin, and had but one Parent, and so was a son of MAN, not
of MEN, that is, only of a mother, and not of father and mother both, as
others are: For by the same reason it might be inferred that Ezechiel had but
one parent, because he is called A son of MAN: besides, by this reason
Christ should be called (...).
A son of woman, not a son of man. But other better reasons may be given of
this title, as to show

1 That Christ was true man.

2 That he came of the stock of man, and brought not his humane nature from
heaven.

3 That he descended very low for our sakes, being the Son of God, to become
a Son of Man. If any shall reply against this, and say, The title MAN might
have implied as much, I answer, that there is a far greater emphasis in this
title Son of Man: as, according to the Hebrew phrase it is more emphaticall
to say, a son of disobedience, a son of perdition, then a disobedient and
forlorn man.

To apply that which has been said of this title, it is without all exception
clear, that by the Son of Man, is here meant Christ Jesus. For Christ never
attributes this title to any but to himself. Besides, sin and blasphemy (which
is here said to be committed against the Son of Man) is not properly
committed against a mere man.

In Christ's manner of setting forth himself under this title, Christ's modesty.
Son of Man, note his modesty and his humility.

He does here set himself forth as God, that has power to forgive sins (a
great and excellent dignity) and therefore speaks of himself in the third
Person, as of another. Behold his modesty.

There were many most excellent titles due and proper to him, Christ's humility.
which others attributed to him, as Son of God, King, Lord, Jesus, Rabbi, and
the like, but he himself makes choice of that which of all other was the
meanest, and ministered least matter of ostentation. Behold his humility.

As these graces are to be admired in Christ, so are they to be imitated by us.

. 12. Of the particular respect wherein the title (Son of Man) is here used.
Having spoken of this title, Son of Man, in general, let us now more
distinctly and particularly consider in what respect it is here used.

Many take it here by way of extenuation, as if Christ more largely had thus
said, Considering that the Son of God was pleased to take upon him man's nature,
and in that nature to appear unto men, and in such a shape to appear, as he
could not be discerned, to be any other then a man, they which speak against
him, and blaspheme him, may seem to have some pretext and excuse, because they
knew him not to be the Son of God: and in that respect their sin may be
forgiven them. They who take this title used here in this sense, illustrate
their meaning with the similitude of a Kings son and heir, apparrelled with
a beggars tagged rags: if any of the subjects meeting him, but not knowing
him, should revile him, and otherwise abuse him, that subject should not be
condemned of high treason: his ignorance of the person would extenuate his fact.

Answ. Though that similitude do fitly illustrate the pretended sense and
meaning of the words: yet this sense is not pertinent to the present place and
purpose of Christ.

The maine scope of Christ in this place is to aggrauate the sin against the
Holy Ghost. Post vniuersalem commenmorationem omnium peccatoru^, omnisque
blasphemiae, eminentius voluit exprimere blasphemiam quae fit contra filiu^t
hominis. Aug. Sermon. 15. de verb. Dom.
But to compare it with a small light sin, is no aggrauation. Wherefore, I
rather take this title ( Son of Man) in a contrary sense, not in way of
extenuation, but of aggrauation: whereunto it tends, if this title be taken
as setting forth on the one side the low degree of humiliation, whereunto
Christ descended for our sakes, together with the unspeakable love of God, in
giving his only begotten Son to be a Son of Man; and on the other side
man's light account, or rather plain contempt of Christ's abasement, and of Gods
kindness: as if more largely and distinctly it had been thus said, Though men,
not in thought only, but by word and deed also, dishonor and blaspheme him, who
is not only the Almighty Creator of all things, but also the merciful
Redeemer of mankind, who being the eternal Son of God, for man's sake became
a Son of Man, and from the highest heavens descended into the lowest parts of
the earth, to deliver them, who through fear of death were all their life time
subject to bondage, yet may this sin and this blasphemy be forgiven. To
illustrate this with the forenamed similitude; Simile.
Suppose a Kings subject be a gally-slaue, and to redeem him, the King send
his only son, and this son become a poor slave to deliver that subject,
and yet that subject speak against, revile, and evil entreat this Prince, is
not this more then monstrous ingratitude? And is it not admirable goodness in
the King and Prince to forgive that ingratitude? This is that goodness of God
which is intimated under this phrase, Whosoever shall speak a word against the
SON OF MAN, it shall be forgiven him.

. 13. Of Gods goodness over coming man's ungratefulness
THE Doctrine arising from the forenamed clause, is this:

Man's vngratef^lnesse dries not up the spring of Gods goodness. Doct.


Note how David sets forth Gods goodness in this respect: for after he had
set forth the ingratitude of the Israelites in many respects, Psalm. 78. 38.
concerning God he says, Yet he being full of compassion forgave their
iniquity. And again, after he had showed how they forgate God their Savior,
Psalm. 105. 21, 23. 45.
etc. He adds, that God turned away his wrath, and remembered for them his
Covenant. Ier. 3. 1.
Thou have played the harlot with many lovers (a great point of ingratitude)
yet turn again to me, says the Lord to rebellious Israel. But most evidently
is this proved by that mercy which was showed to many thousands of those Jews,
who euilly entreated the Son of Man, Act. 3. 22* and 3. 14, 15.
a man approved of God among them by miracles, wonders and signs: And denied
the Holy one and Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto them: And
killed the Prince of life.

The Reason is evident. Reason.
Gods goodness arises from himself: and it is answerable to his greatness.
As man's unworthiness hinders not God to show mercy to man at first, when he
is dead in sin: so man's ungratefulness stops not the current of his
mercy when it has begun to flow forth: but like a flood of water it
ouerfloweth all the dammes that are made against it by man's ingratitude: what
God does, he does for his own sake.

As before we had evidences of Gods rich mercy, so here behold long-suffering
mixed with mercy* nothing commends ones patience more then abuse of kindness:
By Gods ouercomming man's evil with his goodness, he shows himself to be
slow to anger, and that he delights not in the death of sinners.

Thou disobedient Israel return, and I will not let my wrath fall upon you,
for I am merciful.

Romans 12. 21.
but to overcome evil with goodness.

THE SECOND PART.
Of Gods Justice.
A General use of all that has been said of the Mercy of God in forgiving
sins, A Transition from Gods mercy to his justice.
even all manner of sins, not blasphemies excepted, committed by any person,
yea though the blaspemie be uttered against the Son of Man, is to justify
Gods severity against the sin and blasphemy of the Holy Ghost. For which
purpose, without question, Christ has here so magnified the Mercy of God, as
the like place is not to be found throughout the whole Scripture. Wherefore
having spoken of Gods mercy in pardoning every sin but one, let us consider
his Justice in affording to pardon to that one sin: which is the sin against
the Holy Ghost.

. 14. Of abusing Gods mercy.
IN that Christ infers the severity of Gods Justice upon the riches of his
mercy, and after he had delivered what he could of the Mercy of God, adds a
BUT ( Every sin shall be forgiven, BUT the sin against the holy Ghost shall
never be forgiven). He gives us to understand, that

Gods mercy and long-suffering may be so far abused, Doctr. Abuse of mercy
causes extremity of justice.
as nothing but extremity of justice can be looked for. Thus much implies the
Apostle, where he says, It is impossible that such and such should be renewed:
And again, There remains no more sacrifice for sin, Heb. 6 4, 6. and 10.
26, 27.
but a fearful looking for of judgment. Leu. 26. 23, 24
The phrases of Gods walking stubbornely against them that walk stubbornely
against him, Psalm. 18. 26.
and showing himself froward with the froward, 1. Sam. 3. 14.
and swearing that the iniquity of men shall not be purged with sacrifice,
nor offering for ever, with the like, do also prove as much.

Gods mercy would be notoriously abused, Reason.
if at some times, and in some cases, the very extremity of justice should not
be executed. It stands much with the honor of God, to show himself sometimes
a God of vengeance, and a consuming fire.

Son of Man, as by degrees fall into the sin against the Holy Ghost. The
fearfulness of which estate follows now to be declared.

. 15. Of the object of the unpardonable sin. The Holy Ghost.
IN handling the sin against the Holy Ghost, we are to consider 1 The Nature
2 The Issue thereof.



The Nature of the finne is set forth under the names given to it. It is by
(...).
Saint Matthew termed the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost, and a speaking against
the Holy Ghost. By Saint Mark, (...).
a blaspheming against the Holy Ghost. In all which phrases are noted forth,
both the Object, and the Quality of that sin.

The Object, against which in special this sin is directed and committed, is
the Holy Ghost. And in this respect Saint Matthew calls it the blasphemy of
the Holy Ghost: not as if it were in the Holy Ghost, which is blasphemy to
think, but because (as the other phrases do expressly declare) it is against
the Holy Ghost. In this sense this kind of phrase is often used: for where it
said that Christ gave his Disciples power against unclean spirits (as it is
well translated according to the meaning of the phrase) word for word it is in
the original Power of unclean spirits. Matthew. 10. 1.
This I have the rather noted, Mark 6. 7. (...).
to mollify the phrase of some, who speaking, preaching and writing of this
sin, style it The sin of the Holy Ghost: which speech being well taken (the
Holy Ghost being conceived to be not the subject, but the Object thereof) it
may safely be used.

Now the Holy Ghost is made the Object of this sin, not in regard of his
Essence, or Person, but in regard of his Office and Operation.

The Holy Ghost, in regard of his Essence, is all one with the Father and the
Son: all the three Persons are one in nature and essence, all one God: in
which respect a sin committed against any one, is committed against every one
of the three Persons.

The Holy Ghost also in regard of his Person, is the Spirit of the Father, and
of the Son, proceedigg from them both, and no way greater then the Father or
the Son: they are all in dignity coequall: so as in this respect a sin
against the Holy Ghost cannot be greater then against the Father and the Son.

But there is an office and operation peculiarly in Scripture attributed to
each Person. The peculiar office and operation attributed to the Spirit, is,

1 To inlighten men's minds with the knowledge of the Gospel, and to reveal
unto them the good will of God, and way to happiness, in which respect he is
called The Spirit of revelation. Ephesians. 1. 17.


2 To persuade their hearts of the truth of those things which he has revealed
to their understanding, by virtue whereof, Heb. 6. 5.
men are said to taste of the good Word of God, after that they are made
partakers of the Holy Ghost.

3 To move them to acknowledge and profess the Gospel to be the Word of
God, which is implied by the Apostle under this phrase of receiving the
knowledge of the truth. Heb. 10. 26.


There are also many other works of the Spirit, but these are the most
pertinent unto our purpose, and will give light unto all the rest.

The sin here noted to be committed against the Holy Ghost, is committed
against him, in regard of the forenamed operations of the Spirit, so as it is
against that truth of God, which the Spirit has revealed to a man, and euicted
and persuaded his heart of the certainty thereof, so as in his heart he cannot
but acknowledge, that it is an evident and undeniable truth, and is often moved
with his mouth to profess as much.

. 16. Of the quality of the sin against the Holy Ghost.
THe Quality (or effect of this sin: for the sin it self is seated
principally in the heart) is speaking against, and blasphemy. This latter word
expounds the former. For it is not every kind of speaking against, but an
ignominious, approbrious, dispitefull speaking against: which is blasphemy.
For blasphemy is here taken in the uttermost extent thereof, and that both in
regard of the matter, which is to deny the evidence of the Spirit, and also in
regard of the manner, which is to do it with disgraceful, and despitefull
speeches, to the open dishonor of God, and of his Gospel, and of the Spirit,
which has given undoubted evidence of the power of God: as the Scribes and
Pharisees, who did not only deny that Christ cast out devils by the finger and
power of God: but also most reproachfully and slanderously said, Matthew. 12. 24.
This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beel-zebub the Prince of devils:
And again, Mark. 3. 30.
He has an unclean spirit.

. 17. Of the definition of the sin against the Holy Ghost.
THe words and phrases whereby Christ sets forth the nature of this sin,
being expounded, we may out of them gather this definition.

The sin against the Holy Ghost is a despitefull rejecting of the Gospel,
after that the Spirit has supernaturally persuaded a man's heart of the truth
and benefit thereof.

The Genus.
general matter of this definition, is, a rejecting of the Gospel.

The Forma.
particular form, whereby this sin is distinguished from other sins, is in
the other words.

For the matter.

The Gospel is it, Of the Gospel, see Treat, 2. part. 5.. 4.
against which this sin in particular is directed, and not every part of Gods
word. By the Gospel, I mean that part of Gods word, which God has revealed
for man's salvation, even after his fall: and in that respect commonly called
the glad tidings of salvation. So as the very object matter, whereabout this
sin is occupied, does in part discover the heinousness thereof, and declare
a reason why it is not pardoned.

To oppose against any part of Gods truth, Of Gods truth, see Treat. 2. part.
6.. 27.
is a monstrous and heinous sin: for an especial part of Gods honor
consists in his truth, which is as dear and precious to him, as any thing
can be: to gainsay it, is to deny him to be God: Psalm. 31. 5.
for he is styled, The Lord God of truth. But to gainsay the Gospel, that
part of Gods truth wherein Jesus who was sent to save his people from their
sins, Matthew. 1. 21.
wherein the riches of Gods mercy, and wherein the (...).
peculiar love of God to man is revealed, and that for man's good, even for his
eternal salvation, is more then monstrous. For this is not only a denying of
Gods truth, but of his mercy also: yea (if we well consider the extent of the
Gospel) of the wisdom, power, justice, and all other properties of God. It
adds unto other sins (to make up the heap of them) ingratitude. It takes
away the means of pardon and life: for in the Gospel, only in the Gospel is
pardon offered, and life to be found; without it, is nothing but death and
damnation. When the Gospel is not received, what hope can there be of pardon?
This is it that brings God (who by a solemn oath has protested, Ezekiel. 33.
11.
that he desires not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked should turn
from his way and live) to complain and say What could I have done any more,
Isa. 5. 4.
that I have not done? If not to receive the Gospel be a deadly and damnable
sin, what is to reject it. To reject a thing is more then not to receive it:
it is to put it away, as the Jews, who in that respect are said to judge
themselves unworthy of everlasting life. Act. 13. 46. Simile.
It is as if traitors and rebels being risen up against their Sovereign, and
he offering pardon unto them, if they would lay down their weapons, and turn
to be loyal subjects; they should reject his gracious offer, and say they will
none of his favor, they care not for pardon: they had rather be hanged,
drawn, and quartered, then be beholding to him for favor and pardon. Does not
this rejecting of favor much aggrauate the crime? Yea, is not this a more
heinous crime then the treason and rebellion it self?

Hereinto all that commit the sin against the Holy Ghost do fall: but yet all
that fall thereinto do not commit that sin. For as none that perish in their
sin receive the Gospel, so all incredulous persons which live under the
Gospel, and ministry thereof, whereby pardon is proclaimed and offered unto
them, do refuse and reject it: so as this part of the general matter of this
sin is common to all that, at least living under the ministry of the Gospel,
believe not.

In the definition of this sin, we further added this word, Despitefull:
which also appertains to the general matter thereof.

To reject the Gospel despitefully, does make the matter much more desperate:
for it implies an inbred hatred against the Gospel it self, the Word of
salvation: whence proceed open blasphemies against God and his Word, and fierce
and cruel persecuting of the Preachers, and professors of the Gospel.

This despitefulnesse added to rejecting of the Gospel, brings a man into a
most fearful and desperate estate: yet all that ascend to this high pitch of
impiety, do not simply therein sin against the holy Ghost: for all this may
be done on ignorance. Instance Paul's example: he was so zealous of the
traditions which the Jews received from their Elders, as he hated the Gospel,
which he deemed to be contrary thereunto: Act. 26. 9.
in which respect, He thought that he ought to do many things contrary to the
name of Jesus: Act. 9. 1, 13, 21
and so he did: for out of his inward hatred He breathed out threatenings and
slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord: he did much evil to the Saints:
he destroyed them that called on the name of Jesus: he compelled many to
blaspheme, Act. 26. 11.
and waxed mad against the Saints: yea, he himself was a blasphemer. 1. Tim.
1. 13.
But all these he did ignorantly: for a man may hate and blaspheme that which
he knows not. Great was that despite which many of the Jews showed against
Christ, and against Stephen: Act^ 7. 55*
They were cut to the heart, and gnashed at Stephen with their teeth: Luke 23.
34.
yet both Christ and Stephen prayed for them: Act. 7. 60.
which they would not have done, 1. Ioh. 5. 16.
if they had sinned the sin unto death, because it is forbidden so to do.

Thus much of the general matter of the sin against the Holy Ghost: wherein
other sins may agree with it.

The particular form whereby it is distinguished from all other sins, is in
these words ( After that the Spirit has supernaturally persuaded a man's heart
of the truth and benefit thereof.) Out of which I gather these conclusions,
concerning the persons that commit this sin.

1 They must have knowledge of the Gospel: their judgment must be euicted of
that truth which they oppose: whereby they come to sin against their own
knowledge and judgment.

2 This knowledge must not only swim in the brain, but also work upon
their will, and diue into their heart: so as their will give consent, and their
heart assent to what their judgment coneiueth to be true. There must be a
persuasion as well as knowledge; whereby they come to sin against conscience,
that judge which God has placed in men's souls to accuse or excuse them.

3 This knowledge and persuasion must be wrought not only by evidence of
undeniable arguments, (for so an Heathen man may be euicted, and persuaded) but
also by a supernatural and inward work of Gods Spirit, whereby they are in
their very souls persuaded that they gainsay the undoubted word of God, and
so sin against the work of the Spirit in them.

4 This inward supernatural persuasion must be of the benefit of the Word, as
well as of the truth thereof: that the Word which they despitefully gainsay,
is the Word of salvation (which, whosoever believes, shall not perish, but
have life everlasting) and the only means of salvation (whosoever rejects
it, shall be damned.) Thus in sinning against the forenamed work of the
Spirit, they sin against their own souls, and bring swift damnation upon
themselves.

Briefly to sum up all that has been delivered of the sin against the Holy
Ghost: It consists of these degrees.

1 A rejecting of the Gospel: Heb. 10. 28, 29.
which the Apostle in his description of this sin evidently notes: for first
he makes an opposition betwixt despisers of the Law, and despisers of that
against which they sin, that fall into this unpardonable sin: now what can that
which is opposed to the Law be, Verse. 29.
but the Gospel? Again, his description of that which is despised, can agree
to nothing so well as to the Gospel.

2 A despitefull rejecting thereof, Ibid.
which the same Apostle notes under these phrases, a treading under foot:
counting an unholy thing; despiting.

Under this clause are comprised malice and hatred of heart, blasphemy of the
tongue, and persecution, in all which the Scribes and Pharisees manifested
great despite against Christ: so have all others that ever committed this
sin. In this respect the Apostle calls them adversaries. Verse. 27.


3 A despitefull rejecting of the Gospel against knowledge: which the Apostle
expressly notes in this phrase, after we have received the knowledge of the
truth. Verse. 26.


4 A despitefull rejecting of the Gospel against conscience: which the Apostle
implies under this word Wilfully.

5 A wilful gainsaying and opposing against the inward operation, and
supernatural revelation of the Holy Ghost: which is noted by the Apostle under
this phrase, Has done despite unto the Spirit of grace. Verse. 29.


6 A despiting of the Spirit in such things as he reuealeth to them for their
own good, even the salvation of their souls: this is comprised under those
phrases of tasting the heavenly gift, Heb. 6. 4, 5.
the good word of God, and powers of the world to come, which they do, as it
were, spit out again.

. 18. Of the difference betwixt the sin against the Holy Ghost, and other
sins.
BY the forenamed definition may the sin against the Holy Ghost be
distinguished from many other sins which come near unto it, as,

1 From many sins against knowledge: yea and against conscience also: for
they may be without malice of heart, which this cannot be. The elect may fall
into them: but not into this. 2. Sam. 24. 4.
David and Peter sinned both against knowledge, Mat. 26. 69.
and also against conscience.

2 From many sins committed on malice against Christ and his Gospel: 1. Tim.
1. 13.
which may be done on ignorance.

3 From blasphemy and persecution: which may be done also Ibid.
on ignorance, 2. Cro. 16. 10
or in passion.

4 From denial of Christ, which may be done on fear (instance Peter's example)
or other like temptations. Mat. 26. 69.
It is an ancient heresy of the Nouatians to deny repentance and pardon to
such as have once denied Christ. Aug. lib. de her. and lib. de quaest.


5 From Apostasy from the faith, and profession of religion, which also may
be done not on malice, but through the violence of some temptation. It is
noted of Solomon, 1. King. 11. 4, 5, 6.
that he continued not to follow the Lord, but turned after other gods, through
the persuasion of his wives. When a Kingdom changes Religion, as England in
Queen Mary's days, many prove Apostates, and fall away from the profession
of the Gospel, and profess idolatry for fear of persecution, or for too
much love of this world, to hold their places and offices, their honors and
dignities, their houses and lands, or else on an infirm and weak persuasion,
that they can keep their hearts pure, and their faith sound, though with their
bodies they outwardly subject themselves to idolatry. The Levites which in the
captivity fell away, Ezekiel. 44. 10. etc.
though they were barred from meddling with the holy things, yet they were
admitted to do other services in the Temple, whereby it is manifest that they
fell not into this unpardonable sin.

6 From Presumption and sinning with an high hand, as Manasseh did. 2. Cro. 33.
13.


7 From Hardness of heart, Ephe. 4. 17. 18
from impudency, and committing sin with greediness. For so did the Gentiles
which had not the Gospel supernaturally revealed unto them.

8 From Infidelity and impenitencie, yea from final infidelity and
impenitencie, whereinto all the reprobate fall. If final impenitencie should
be the sin against the Holy Ghost (as some do take it) then should every one
that is damned sin against the Holy Ghost: yea then could not this sin be
committed till death: and then in vain should the caveat of Saint John be, 1.
Ioh. 5. 16.
concerning not praying for them.

. 19. Of the persons that may fall into the sin against the Holy Ghost.
Having seen what the sin against the Holy Ghost is, Whether the Scribes and
Pharisees blasphemed the holy Ghost, or not.
for application of the point to the parties with whom Christ had to do, we
will in the next place discuss whether the Scribes and Pharisees that
slandered Christ, committed this sin or not.

Many say they did not commit this sin: and to prove their assertion, they use
these two arguments.

1 They never professed Christ.

2 Christ prayed for them. Luke 23. 34.


To the first I answer, that two sorts of people may fall into this sin:
namely, they who profess Christ and his Gospel, and they who never professed
it.

Professors that sin against the Holy Ghost, Who are Apostates.
are called Apostates, that is, departers away, namely, from the faith, or from
the profession of the Gospel (for the Greek word, 2. These. 2. 3. (...).
which according to the notation of it, signifies Apostasy, is translated a
departing, and a falling away) not that all who depart away, and in that
general sense are called Apostates, do commit this sin, as was noted. 18.
before: but because they that fall into this sin, are most notorious
Apostates: denying the truth, not in tongue only, but in heart also: not
through fear, but in malice, utterly renouncing, and bidding defiance to the
faith: not contenting themselves to deny it, but showing themselves deadly
enemies against it, and persecuting all that are friends unto it: having in
that respect a very diabolical property, not enduring that any should reap
benefit by that which they have rejected: such an Apostate was Alexander the
Copper-smith, and Julian. 2. Tim. 4. 14.


They who never professed the truth of the Gospel, They who never professed
the Gospel may sin against the holy Ghost.
may also sin against the Holy Ghost, as they do to whom the Spirit has so
clearly and supernaturally revealed the truth of the Gospel, as their heart
and conscience does inwardly tell them that they ought to make profession
thereof, yet their malice against it, not only keeps them from professing
it, but also makes them to revile it, Tit. 3. 11. (...).
and to persecute the professors of it. The Apostle says of such an one; that
he is condemned of himself. Such were the Scribes and Pharisees which
blasphemed Christ: and such are many of the learneder Papists.

The difference betwixt these two sorts, is that the former has gone a step
further in show of goodness, but thereby have made their fall the more
offensive, and their sin the greater, in that to the sin against the Holy
Ghost, they have added Apostasy, as some add oppression, murder, and the
like.

To the second argument, Whether Christ prayed for them that blasphemed his
works. Luke 23. 34.
to prove that the forenamed Scribes and Pharisees sinned not against the holy
Ghost, taken from Christ's prayer, I answer that Christ prayed not in
particular for these, but for such as were indeed in the outward act
associates, but not of so evil a disposition as they. As among Papists blind
zeal moves many to do that, which deadly malice moves others to do.

I doubt not but we may, Reasons that the Scribes and Pharisie sinned against
the Holy Ghost.
according to the truth of the matter, conclude that the forenamed Scribes and
Pharisees sinned against the Holy Ghost: for

1 The Gospel was preached to them by John the Baptist, Christ, and his
Disciples, yet they received it not, but refused and rejected it.

2 They did it despitefully, as their carriage shows.

3 They blasphemed Christ, as we have heard before, and they persecuted him and
his Disciples.

4 They did all this against knowledge and against conscience: Matthew. 12. 27.
as the instance which Christ gives, of their justifying that in their
children, which they condemned in Christ: Matthew. 21. 38.
yea they could say of Christ, This is the heir.

5 They did all, also, after the Spirit had supernaturally revealed Christ unto
them: for it is noted that Jesus knew their thoughts, Matthew. 12. 25. Verse. 31.
and thereupon he accused them of blaspheming the Holy Ghost: he knew their
thoughts, that is, he knew how far the Spirit had wrought in them, and how they
striued against, and resisted the Spirit, and in that respect accuses them of
this blasphemy.

Lastly, to put the matter out of all doubt, after that Christ had set out this
sin, Saint Mark adds this clause, Because they said he had an unclean
spirit. Mark. 3. 30.
Implying by that inference, that, that blasphemy was in them an evidence of
the sin against the Holy Ghost.

. 20. Of the meaning of these words, SHALL NOT, and SHALL NEVER be forgiven,
THe second general point, noted by Christ, about the sin against the Holy
Ghost, is the Issue thereof:

which is set down Negatiuely: Affirmatively.

Negatiuely, both by Saint Mark in these words ( has never forgiveness) and
also by S. Matthew in these words ( shall not be forgiven unto men) which is
further amplified by a distinction of times, in these words ( neither in this
world, nor in the world to come).

Affirmatively, only by Saint Mark, in these words ( is in danger of eternal
damnation).

The sentence and doom which Christ in all these words and phrases has given
of this sin, is very perspicuous and clear, but that Papists have brought a
cloud of obscurity upon them, by the vapors of their false glosses and
heresies: which we will first remove, and then declare the fearful issue of
this sin.

First, the Papists clean overthrow the maine point here intended, Bellar.
tom. 3. contr. 4. de paenit. lib. 2. cap. 16. Iansen. Concor. Euang. cap. 49.
by interpreting the indefinite negative particle ( not) and the general
negative ( never) to as if a difficulty only, and not an impossibility were
intended, as if Christ had said, the sin against the holy Ghost shall not
easily, but very hardly be forgiven: or, ordinarily and for the most part, it
shall not be forgiven. But the words are more clear, then so to be obscured.
For, Not, Never, Nor in this world, nor in the world to come: are much more
then not ordinarily, not easily, hardly, and for the most part. Besides, if
there were not an impossibility of the pardon of it, prayer might be made for
the party that commits it, 1. Ioh. 5. 16.
which may not be done. But as this text is clear enough to such as have not
contentious and captious spirits, so there are other texts which put the point
more out of all doubt and question: as where the Apostle says, It is
impossible to renew them again: Heb. 6. 4 6. and 10. 26, 27.
And again, There remains no more sacrifice for sins, but a fearful
looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation.

. 21. Of the errors which Papists gather from this phrase, nor in the World to
come.
Again, Papists roue far beyond the scope of Christ in this place, by
inferring from this clause ( nor in the World to come) that some sins which
are not forgiven in this World, Bellar. de Purgat. lib. 1. ca. 4. 11.
may be forgiven in the World to come: whence they further infer, that there
is a Purgatory after this life; and render these reasons of this latter
inference: First, that into Heaven can enter no unclean thing. Secondly, that
out of hell there can be no redemption: therefore (say they) there must needs be
a Purgatory, by which they which die in their sins must be purged, and out of
which they whose sins are forgiven after this life, must be delivered.

Answ. Reu. 21. 27.
The two positions which are laid down for reasons, are sound and true: for
neither can any unclean thing enter into Heaven, nor can any that are once
cast into hell, be ever delivered out of it; for the Scripture terms their
pain everlasting: Mat. 25. 46. Papists make lewd sinners Saints in heaven.
and yet the Papists are not constant in those assertions, but deliver many
points contrary to them both: as that many who for treasons, rebellions, and
such like damnable sins are executed, and die without repentance for them,
die Martyrs, and are immediately carried to glory: is not this to thrust
unclean birds into Heaven. And again, that many who died in mortal sins,
Papists teach that some have been delivered out of hell.
and so by their own positions went to hell, were delivered from thence. Some
of the instances which their own writers have given hereof, are these: Ioh.
Damasc. in orat. de mortuis.
The soul of Falconilla a Pagan, was freed from hell by the prayers of Saint
Thecla, and Ibid.
the soul of Traiane a Pagan Emperor, by the prayers of Pope Gregory, and
Greg. lib. 1. dialog. cap. 12.
a certain lewd man carried by the Devils into hell, was delivered by Saint
Sereus.

But to pass by these lying fables, the consequences which from the forenamed
sound positions they gather, are most unsound, and absurd; namely, that there
is a purgatory, (of which fiction I have spoken Treat. 3. of Prayer.. 40.
before) and that sins may be forgiven after this life: a point which (as was
said before) they gather from this phrase ( nor in the World to come.) Rhemists
on Mat. 12. 32.
) The falsehood whereof is easily discovered by a due consideration of the true
meaning of the words.

. 22. Of the true meaning of this phrase, nor in this world, nor in the world
to come.
THe Greek word, (...) seculum.
and the Latin also, which we translate World, signifies rather time, then
place. By this World, is meant the time of a man's life here upon earth: by the
World to come, all the time from his death proceeding on without end to
eternity. Two Worlds are in Scripture given to every man to be in, one from the
time of his conception, or birth, to his death; the other from thence for ever:
for after death there is no alteration of a man's estate. But because the
manifestation of that perpetual and eternal estate is at the great day of
judgment, when all shall stand before their Judge, and receive their doom,
the beginning of that age, or world to come, is commonly reckoned from the day
of judgment: in which respect Christ joins that world, and the resurrection
from the dead together. Luke 20. 35.
Which being so, it is as evident as may be, that no sin can be forgiven in
the World to come.

. 23. Of the many answers which may be given against the Papists collection
concerning forgiveness of sins in the World to come.
BVtfully to discover the erroneous collection of Papists touching forgiveness
of sins after death, out of this phrase ( nor in the World to come.) Let it
be noted that

1 Saint Mark, Mar. 3. 29. (...)
the best interpreter of Saint Matthew, expounds that phrase by this general
particle, NEVER, or in no age.

2 They cannot show that the world to come is any where taken for the time that
passes betwixt this life ended, and the day of judgment, which is the time
appointed by them for remission of sins in Purgatory: for they hold that at
the day of judgment that fire shall be put out; and Extendere tempora
purgatory vltra diem resurrectionis est error exploratus. Bellar. de purg. lib.
2. cap. 9.
that it is a manifest error to extend the time of Purgatory beyond the day of
the resurrection.

3 If it were granted that by the World to come, is meant the time betwixt
death and judgment, yet may it be applied to the very end or passing away of
the former World, and beginning or entrance into the other World; namely, for
the very moment of death, as if he had said, this sin shall not be forgiven,
either in the time of this life, or at the point of death, when a man is
entering into another World. Thus the Compare Mat. 28. 1. with Luke 24. 1.
evening of the Sabbath is called the first day of the week.

4 The remission here spoken of in the World to come, may be taken for the
manifestation and ratification of that which was granted before: as if he had
thus said, As in this World he shall receive no remission, so in the World to
come when all shall stand upon their trial to be acquitted, or condemned, no
remission shall be pronounced to him, but he shall receive the sentence of
condemnation.

5 This phrase ( shall not be forgiven) may figuratively be put for the effect
that follows upon sin not forgiven, namely, just vengeance, and so the
meaning may be this; Just vengeance shall be executed upon him both in this
world, and in the world to come; as ever has been executed on all such as
sinned against the Holy Ghost.

6 It is no good consequence from a negative to infer the contrary
affirmative. What if Christ had said that Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
shall never be forgiven, neither on earth, nor in hell; would it from thence
follow that some sins may be forgiven in hell?

7 Christ comparing this sin which shall not be forgiven in this world, or in
the world to come, with blasphemy against the Son of Man, by the consequence
which they infer, it would follow that blasphemy against the Son may be
forgiven in the world to come; which is directly against their own principles:
for all blasphemy is a mortal sin; but they say Purgatorium projis tantum
est qui cum venialibus culpis moriuntur. Bellar. de Purg. lib. 2. cap. 1.
that Purgatory is only for them who die in venial sins.

8 If any sins might be forgiven in the world to come, by the order of the
words in this phrase, ( nor in this world, nor in the world to come) it would
follow that the more heinous sins should be forgiven in the world to come:
else Christ would have said, Nor in the world to come, nor in this world.

9 Christ here speaks of remitting the Fault: but by their doctrine only the
punishment is remitted after this life: for they acknowledge that Culpas ipsas.
Catholici omnes Christi san, guine purgari affirmant. Bellar. de paen. lib. 1.
cap. 2.
the very faults themselves are purged by the blood of Christ, and that they
who in this life have not the fault remitted, can have no hope of eternal
life. This place therefore speaking of forgiving the fault, how can they apply
it to the punishment?

. 24. Of the reasons why this phrase (nor in this world, nor in the world to
come) is used.
Quest. IF no sin can be forgiven in the world to come, why is this clause (
nor in the World to come) added?

Answ. Though no reason could be given, yet we may not from thence infer a
paradox, and an error contrary to other places of Scripture. But among other
reasons two especially may be noted to make the phrase the more perspicuous.

1 To aggrauate the terror of the judgment here denounced against such as
sin against the Holy Ghost: for the very consideration of this, that both in
this world, and in the world to come, they lie under the fiery wrath, and heavy
vengeance of God, cannot be but very fearful and terrible.

2 To show the misery of these sinners above others: Difference betwixt sinners.
for,

1 There be some who keeping sin under, and giving raines thereto, but
walking by faith uprightly before the Lord, are neither punished in this world,
nor in the world to come. Genesis 5. 24.
Such an one was Enoch.

2 There be others that are not so watchful over themselves, but through
security suffer sin to get some head over them, for which they are punished
in this world, but truly repenting, 1 Cor. 5. 5.
are not condemned in the world to come. Such an one was the incestuous person,
both excommunicated, and also restored by the Apostle. Such also were many of
those who discerned not the Lords body when they came to the holy Communion. 1
Cor. 11. 30. etc.


3 There be others also, who though they be impenitent sinners, yet through
Gods indulgency are suffered to enjoy outward peace and prosperity in this
world, and feel the smart of their sin only in the world to come. Such were
they whom Job notes to die in all ease and prosperity: Job 21. 23.
and such an one was Dives. Luke 16. 19. 23


4 But they that sin against the Holy Ghost, are made a spectable of Gods
vengeance, both in this world, and in the world to come: Mat. 27. 5.
as Judas, Julian, and such other.

. 25. Of seeking pardon for sin in this life.
THus we have seen what small reason Papists have to gather from this text,
that sin may be forgiven after death.

For our parts let us give no rest to our souls, Exhortation to seek pardon
while we live.
till we have assurance of the pardon of all our sins, applying to our
selves the sacrifice of Christ for all our sins whatsoever, and let us
unfeignedly turn from them all while here we live; Luke 12. 5.
fearing him who after he has killed the body, has power to cast both body
and soul into hell. And let us not fondly dream of mercy (like the five
foolish Virgins) when it is too late. Mat. 25. 11.
The time that the Gospel is preached, and thereby remission of sins
offered, is the accepted time, the day of salvation: 2 Cor. 6. 2.
and the time of this life, the only time of repentance. If the Lord be not
then found, he will never be found. Wherefore seek the Lord while he may be
found; Isay 55. 6.
and to day, while it is called to day, harden not your hearts. Psalm. 95. 7.


. 26. Of the sense wherein it is said that the sin against the Holy Ghost
shall not be pardoned.
But to return to our matter. Notwithstanding the false glosses of Papists on
this Text, it is most evident and clear, both by the words of Christ, and also
by other Texts of Scripture, noted 20.
before, that the sin against the Holy Ghost neither shall, nor can ever be
pardoned. This sin is not only in the issue and event unpardoned, but in the
nature and kind of it unpardonable. And herein stands the difference which
Christ here makes betwixt this sin, and all other sins. In regard of the
issue, many other sins are no more pardoned then this: for if in the event
all other sins but this should be pardoned, many millions which are now in
hell should be saved. But the difference is, that other sins are of that kind
and condition, as through the means which God has afforded to man, they may
be forgiven: but this cannot by any means.

. 27. Of the reasons why the sin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable.
THe reason why the sin against the Holy Ghost neither shall, nor can be
forgiven, is not simply in regard of the greatness and heinousness of it, as
i^ it were greater then the mercy of God, and sacrifice of Christ; so as if
that sin were put into one balance, The general reason why the sin against
the Holy Ghost is not pardoned. Dan. 6. 15.
and Gods mercy with Christ's sacrifice into another, that would weigh down
this: but rather in regard of that order which God has set down, and that
fixed decree and doom (more immutable then the decrees and statutes which the
things of the Medes and Persians confirmed) which he has both established,
and revealed: I say revealed, because his secret decree is established against
every impenitent sinner, but the order is published, and the decree revealed
only against such as sin against the Holy Ghost.

If further we would know reasons of this revealed decree, I answer, that God
is not bound to render man a reason of his orders, Particular reasons why the
sin against the Holy Ghost is not pardoned.
and decrees: But yet it has pleased him to make known some reasons thereof
in his word, for the better satisfaction of men's minds, and justification of
his own proceedings: as

1 Because it is impossible that they who sin against the Holy Ghost, It is
never repented of. Heb 6. 4. 6.
should be renewed again unto repentance. As no sin, whereof the man that
commits it, repents not, is in the issue and event pardoned; so this sin,
because the co^mitter thereof cannot repent, cannot be pardoned.

2 Because they utterly renounce, 2 Means of pardon is rejected.
and clean reject the only means of pardon; which is, Christ Jesus offered
in the Gospel: Heb. 10. 29.
so as, if they be pardoned, either Christ must be offered up again, and
crucified anew; or else there must be some other sacrifice for remission of
sins. Heb. 6. 6. and 10. 26.
But both those are impossible: impossible it is therefore, that the sin
against the Holy Ghost should be pardoned. It falls out with those that
commit this sin, Simile.
as with a man that is desperately and mortally sick of a disease, which
cannot possibly be cured but by one means, and the patient utterly refuses
that means, and will not have it used; would we not say on that ground, that he
is irrecouerably sick, that it is impossible he should be cured?

3 Because they have wittingly so wholly cast themselves into Satan's power, 3
God is utterly renounced.
and utterly renounced to have to do with God, as it cannot stand with equity,
and with the honor of God to receive them again to mercy; they are in a
manner in such a case and estate as the damned in hell, concerning whom it is
said, that betwixt them and the Saints in Heaven there is a great gulf fixed,
Luke 16. 26.
so as there can be no passage from one to another. Besides, it is probable,
that as they who truly believe, and are in grafted into Christ, have an inward
testimony that they are Gods, and that they shall forever abide in Christ, and
^e saved: so they who sin against the Holy Ghost, having as it were
subscribed to be Satan's, and ever to be with him, and on his side, have an
inward certificate in their hearts that they are utterly forsaken of God, and
shall be damned: and thereupon (as the damned in hell) they blaspheme God whom
they have renounced; yea, with all the spite they can they oppugn the Gospel
through an inward hatred of God the Author, of Christ the matter, of the Holy
Ghost the Reuealer thereof; whom because they cannot reach and come at, they
persecute the professors of the Gospel: like the old red Dragon, who, because
he could not touch the woman that was clothed with the Sun, Revel. 12.
the Moon being under her feet, he went to make war with the remnant of her
seed, which keep the Commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus
Christ.

. 28. Of the certainty of his damnation who sins against the Holy Ghost.
HItherto of the fearful issue of such as sin against the Holy Ghost, set
down negatiuely, in that this sin shall never be forgiven.

To aggrauate the terror hereof, Christ further sets forth the issue of the
same affirmatively, as Saint Mark has recorded his words thus,

Is in danger of eternal damnation. Mar. 3. 29.


The (...)
word translated in danger, or (as others) culpable, does not so much imply a
likelihood that he may be damned, as a certainty that he shall be damned: for
it properly signifies to be held fast, as a bird when she is taken in a
snare, or a Malefactor when he is arrested by a Sergeant, or a condemned man
when he is manicled, and fetteted against the day of execution. It implies
that there is no means, no hope of escaping damnation: so as the maine point
here intended, is this; He that sins against the Holy Ghost, shall most
certainly be damned. This the Apostle also implies, where he says, that to
such an one there remains no more sacrifice for sins, Heb. 10. 26. 27
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation.

The reasons 27.
before al^eadged to prove that this sin shall not be forgiven, do also
prove the certainty of his damnation who commits it.

. 29. Of the eternity of Damnation.
YEt further to aggrauate the fearful estate of him that sins against the
Holy Ghost, it is added, that his damnation is ETERNAL. This everlasting
continuance is common to all that are cast into hell, in which respect their
torments is set forth by such like phrases as these, Mar. 9. 43, 44
The worm that dies not, Fire that shall never be quenched, Jude v. 6.
Everlasting chains, Mat. 25 41.
Eternal fire, 2 These. 1. 9.
Everlasting perdition But the certainty of this everlasting damnation, is that
which is proper to them that sin against the Holy Ghost. The doom is
irreuocably passed against them; while here they live, they know they shall be
cast into endless, easelesse, merciless, and remediless torment.

This aggrauation of damnation by the everlasting continuance of it, The
heresy of the Chiliasts refuted.
does evidently refute the heretical position of Chiliasts, or Millinaries, or
(to use our English word) Thousandaries, who held that the Devils and all the
damned in hell should after a thousand years be delivered. Eternal and
everlasting continuance properly taken, as it is in the forenamed places,
admits no date or end of time: which the forenamed heretics observing,
grant that indeed the fire of hell burns eternally; but they further say that
it burns after the damned are delivered out of it: but this evasion will not
help them. It is certain that God makes nothing in vain. If there be fire
burning eternally, it is for some end and purpose. But what other end or
purpose can be imagined, then the just punishing and tormenting of the damned
in hell? Shall there be an hell, and no creature in it? Besides, Christ
expressly says, they shall go into eternal punishment. Mat. 25. 46.
Now the fire of hell is no longer a punishment, then the damned be tormented
therein: eternally therefore they are tormented therein, and can never be freed
from it.

As for their objections taken from Gods mercy and justice, they may easily be
answered, if Gods former dealing with the damned, and the nature of sin for
which they are condemned, be duly weighed.

. 30. Of the answers to the Chiliasts objection taken from Gods mercy.
COncerning Gods mercy, Object. 1. Gods mercy is over all his works.
they say, that it is over all his works, and thereupon they conclude, that
the damned must partake thereof: which (say they) they cannot do if eternally
they lie tormented in hell.

Answ. Answ. 1. Thus devils and damned have been made partakers of Gods mercy.
Surely they have tasted of Gods mercy: for the Devils were made at first
glorious Angels, Angels of light. The damned were also at first created in a
most happy estate, even after Gods image: and many of them had a long time, and
fair means of repentance offered unto them; besides, the many outward
temporal blessings which in this world they have enjoyed. They all have abused
and rejected Gods mercy.

As for their present estate, Answ. 2. Some mercy is manifested in hell.
I might say that it is some mercy that they are not more tormented: for God
could make them feel more then they do.

But we are to know that Gods mercy and justice must go together. Answ. 3.
Gods justice is not satisfied for the damned.
Where justice is not satisfied, no place is left for mercy: but Gods justice
is not satisfied for the Devils and damned: how then should mercy be expected?

. 31. Of the answers to the Chiliasts objection, taken from Gods justice.
COncerning Gods Justice, Object. 2. Unjust to punish a temporary sin eternally.
they say that it cannot stand with Justice to punish a temporary sin, a sin
which was committing in time, with an everlasting punishment.

But sin though in continuance it were not everlasting, Answ. 1. Sin infinite
in nature.
yet is it in nature infinite: for the greatness of a sin is measured
according to the greatness of the person against whom it is committed. We see
in the counts of men that one and the same wrong committed against a mean man,
and a Monarch, is accounted less or greater. That which being done against a
mean man, will scarce bear an action in Law (as we speak) committed against
a King may prove a capital matter, a matter of high treason, and bring a man
to the gallows. Now every sin is a transgression of Gods Law, and committed
directly against the infinite Majesty; and in that respect it is infinite in
nature, and deserves an infinite punishment. But the creature is finite, and
cannot in time bear an infinite weight of vengeance, and therefore it lies
eternally under it. There is then a proportion betwixt the sin of the damned,
and their punishment: both are infinite. Sin in quantity and greatness, the
punishment in time and continuance: what sin wants in continuance, it has in
greatness; and what the punishment wants in weight, it has in continuance.
Thus the sin and the punishment are correspondent each to other, and God is
just in inflicting an eternal punishment on an infinite sin.

Besides, Answ. 2. The will of the damned to sin is everlasting.
though the damned be restrained, or cut off by the hand of God from an
everlasting continuance to commit sin, yet their will and desire is never to
cease sinning. For herein lies a maine difference betwixt such sinners as have
their sins forgiven, and so are saved, and such as are never forgiven, but are
damned. Those men's minds and wills are altered, and they truly repent of their
sins past, and desire and endeavor to sin no more. But these men's minds and
wills unto their very death are set on sin: and if they could always live on
earth, they would always sin on earth. Now it is the mind, will, and
disposition of a man, whereunto God has especially respect.

Again, Answ. 3. The damned never cease sinning in hell.
the damned continue to sin everlastingly in hell. As the glorious Angels and
blessed Saints in Heaven ever continue to praise the God of Heaven, so the
devils and damned in hell continue to blaspheme the same God. Their punishment
therefore endures no longer then their sin.

Lastly, Answ. 4. The damned wittingly pull on themselves eternal punishment.
Simile.
they wittingly and wilfully pull upon themselves that eternal weight of Gods
wrath, and therefore justly lie under it eternally. God has declared before
hand that eternal damnation shall be the reward of impenitent sinners; and yet
they impenitently continue in sin. Suppose a millstone hanging by a coard, a
man should wilfully stand under that mil-stone, and cut the coard, and withal
refuse to have any means to keep the mil-stone from falling down: did not he
by cutting that coard pull death on himself? This is the case of the damned.
Gods wrath is an infinite burden, by Gods law it is held up over men's heads:
sin is a sword, whereby the coard of Gods law is cut: by faith and repentance
Gods wrath is staid from falling on man. The unbelieving and impenitent sinner
refuses the means of withholding and staying Gods wrath. Is it not now just
that this eternal weight of Gods wrath should lie on him?

Thus we see that it is neither against Gods mercy, nor against his justice to
inflict eternal damnation.

. 32. Of the necessity of being pardoned, or damned.
FRom the connection of this affirmative part of the judgment ( shall be in
danger of eternal damnation) with the negative ( shall never be forgiven) I
collect that, The sinner which has not his pardon cannot escape eternal
damnation: or pardon must be obtained, or the punishment must be undergone.
Matthew. 18. 34.
The servant whose debt the Lord recalled, and would not forgive, because of
his unmercifulness, was delivered to the tormenters.

Otherwise men would not care for Gods favor in pardoning sin, Reason.
nor any thing esteem Christ's sacrifice, whereby pardon is purchased.

David know this point, which made him with an holy admiration say, Blessed is
he whose transgression is forgiven, Psalm. 32. 1, 2.
whose sin is covered: Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not
iniquity. On the contrary side we may say, Cursed is he whose sins are
not forgiven. If eternal damnation do make a man cursed, he is cursed.

. 33. Of preventing the sin against the Holy Ghost.
TO return to the point in hand, we have heard what the sin against the
Holy Ghost is, and what the issue thereof is, namely, Impossibility of pardon,
certainty of eternal damnation. Whose heart does not tremble to think of
their estate? The very Devils do tremble to think of their own doom and
judgment. Dives is thought to be in a most miserable plight. That which
ministers any comfort to sinners in this world, is, that they hope the due
vengeance of their sins shall not be executed upon them. This hope can none
have that sin against the Holy Ghost. Though all sins (as before we have
heard) shall be pardoned, yet a man may so grow on in impudency and
obstinacy, as to sin against the Holy Ghost, and make his sin irremmissible,
and himself certain of eternal damnation.

Let us therefore take heed of making any way to this sin, Use 1. Make no way
to the sin against the Holy Ghost.
and of provoking God to cast us clean over into Satan's power, or rather to
suffer us to give up our selves wholly unto Satan. For the preventing hereof,
let the directions here following be carefully observed.

1 Be watchful against every sin, 1 Withstand beginnings.
yea against the very beginnings of sin. Ephesians. 4. 27.
Give no place to the Devil. Take heed left there be at any time in any of you
an evil heart of unbelief, Heb. 3. 12.
in departing from the living God. Especially let us take heed of sinning
against our own judgment and knowledge, against the persuasion of our heart
and conscience, and against the revelation and motion of Gods Spirit in us.
Sin is deceitful, and Satan is subtle. They allure men step by step to
descend, till by degrees they bring us into this irrecouerable downfall of the
sin against the Holy Ghost.

2 Have the Gospel, 2 Set thy heart on the Gospel.
the Word of salvation, in high account. As we have knowledge thereof, so let
us set our heart and love upon it. Love of the Gospel will make men cleave
close unto it, and will keep them from renouncing of it. 2. These. 2. 10, 11.
If men receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved, God will
send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie, and be damned.
Through light esteem of the Gospel, men often come to reject it: and to prove
Apostates.

3 Duly weigh the difference betwixt Christ and the world; 3 Consides the
gain which comes by holding Christ.
how Christ can uphold thee, and preserve, and protect and prosper thee against
the world: but all the world cannot shelter thee from his warth. True knowledge
of Christ, of the benefits we reap by him, of the privileges we have in him,
of the comfort and peace we receive through him, Phil. 3. 8.
will make us account all the things of this world, in comparison of Christ,
but as dung: and it will make us also stand the more resolutely against all the
assaults of the world, and not suffer our selves thereby to be drawn from
Christ. Let us often call to mind that which Christ has said to this purpose,
Matthew. 16. 26.
What is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
or what shall be give in exchange for his soul?

4 If at any time through his own weakness, 4 Persist not in denying the
faith.
or the violence of any temptation, a man be so far overtaken, as to deny the
Gospel, and to forsake Christ, let him not persist therein; Matthew. 26. 75.
but rather (as Peter did) upon the first occasion offered to discover his
folly, let him thoroughly humble himself, and speedily repent. The longer sin
continues, the stronger it grows: and the greater advantage will Satan take
thereby. Simile.
Deadly poison being speedily purged out, may be kept from infecting the vital
parts.

5 After once thou art recalled, 5 Take heed of ^aple.
having before time denied Christ, be the more watchful over thy self, that
thou deny him not again, Luke (...) 26.
and again. If the Devil being once cast out, return again, He will come
with seven other spirits more wicked then himself. 2. Pet. 2. 20.
If after men have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge
of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and
overcome, the latter end is worse with them then the beginning.

6 While thine heart is pliable pray; 6 Pray against this sin.
earnestly, instantly pray, as against all sins, so especially against
presumptuous sins (as David did) and in particular, Psalm. 19. 13.
against this unpardonable sin. See Treat. 3. of prayer.. 20, 22.
Nothing more powerful against sin and Satan, then faithful prayer: without
this all other means are fruitless. This means is to be used as for our
selves, so also for others (as we have Treat. 3. of Prayer.. 36.
before showed). There is nothing against which we ought more earnestly to
pray, then against this sin: for no estate more desperate then theirs who
fall into this sin.

. 34. Of the persons who cannot fall into the sin against the holy Ghost.
AS this Treatise was begun with declaration of Gods Mercy, in forgiving all
manner of sins, so it shall be concluded with application of comfort to the
elect, and that in regard of the nature and issue of the sin against the Holy
Ghost. That which makes this sin to seem as an hot fiery thunderbolt, even
that which makes it most terrible and dreadful, that, I say, ministers
matter of comfort to the elect, namely, that it is impossible it should be
pardoned, and that the committers thereof are sure to be eternally damned.

The comfort is this, The Elect cannot sin against the holy Ghost.
that the elect are absolutely freed from it, so as they cannot fall into it.

The Reasons are evident.

1 When they come to be enlightened, Reasons. 1 When enlightened, they are born
again.
together with their illumination, regeneration is wrought in them. Now they
who are borne again, cannot so wholly give up themselves to sin and Satan, as
to sin against the Holy Ghost. The Apostle (in a more inferior degree and
kind of sinning, then in this kind against the Holy Ghost) says, Whosoever
is borne of God does not commit sin: for his seed remains in him, 1. John 3.
9.
and he cannot sin because he is borne again.

2 All the sins of the elect in the issue and event are Venial, 2 All their
sins are venial.
such as shall be pardoned. For though in the nature and kind of sin, every of
their sins are (as the sins of all other) Romans 6. 23.
mortal (For the wages (and due deserts) of sin (not any one sin excepted) is
death) yet has Christ by his death satisfied for all their sins. All therefore
shall be pardoned to them.

3 All that are elected, 3 They are elected to life
are elected to eternal life: and being elected thereto, they shall assuredly
be made partakers thereof. Gods purpose and decree remains firm and stable,
and cannot be made frustrate. They are not therefore in danger of eternal
damnation: and so cannot fall into that sin.

Yet let no man be presumptuous, or secure in this regard: for first, he may
be mistaken in his election, and think he is chosen, when indeed he is not.
If he be deceived, and mistake the marks of his election, then is he not
exempted from this sin, and the fearful issue thereof.

Again, though he be elected, yet if he be not watchful over himself, he
may fall into so great a gulf of sin, and be so near the pit of eternal
damnation, as he will have cause again, and again to repent his folly, as
we have * before showed. Treat. 2. of Faith.. 60.
Let us therefore work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Unto which
salvation that we may be kept blameless, Phil. 2. 12.
The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, 2. Cor. 13. 14.
and the love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost be with us all. Amen.
