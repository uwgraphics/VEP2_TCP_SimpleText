THE TRIAL of true Friendship; Or perfect mirror, whereby to discern a trusty
friend from a flattering Parasite. Otherwise, A knacke to know a knave from an
honest man: By a perfect mirror of both: Soothly to say; Try ere you trust;
Believe no man rashly. No less profitable in observing, then pleasant in
reading. By M. B.

Imprinted at London by Valentine Simmes dwelling on Adling hill at the sign
of the white Swanne. 1596.

(...) Walter Flude, Gentleman V.S. wishes all happiness.
TO recognize (sir) in multitude of words, how much charged I stand unto your
bounty, were to your wisdom, I know, but frivolous, who better respects
the inward service intended of any one (whereof I humbly beseech you on my part
to stand assured) than an outward behauior, the validity whereof many ways
may be doubted. Yet nevertheless, in that the thoughts of men are only in
word or action to be desciphered, let it, I beseech you, stand with your good
favor, that I may by this little mite of my friends labors confess my self
bound unto you: and for the residue, when it shall seem good unto you to
command me, I will not have life or ability that shall not be yours, in all
it may please you to use me. Thus much to have delivered, may, for the present,
satisfy my mind but thus much to have performed, would content my soul, for
that in all actions of the body inwardly to be effected, the mind is pleased
with speech, and the heart only is replenished by the doing. Much more to have
protested, were no more than sufficient, though more than wherewith your
modesty will be pleased, for which, I remain in heart more than in ability
to answer the same: humbly submitting my poor service to the censure thereof,
and recommending you unto the protection of the Almighty, and to the happy
possessing of your hearts best content.

Yours ever affectionate, Valentine Simmes.

The trial of true Friendship, Or, A Knacke to know a knave from an honest man.
THe gods desirous (as Poets feign) to show forth the omnipotency of their
deity and their incomparable cunnings united in one, to the intent they might
purchase themselves some great commendations and honor upon earth, determined
to carue a piece of some curious perfection, wherein might be expressed the
substance of the gods, and beauty of the graces: whereupon they framed a man
so angelical in form and exquisit in feature, that as for the lineaments of
his face, or the proportion of his body, it was impossible to say the least
thing imaginary to be any where wanting. This demie-god being perfected and
sent upon the earth, when as none could condemn either the creature of want, or
the creators for lack of skill; Momus at length found this fault, that the gods
had not made a window in his breast through which to perceive the inward
thoughts and secrets of his heart (meaning as I conjecture) that as the
glitteringst Diamond being broken distilleth the deadliest poison, as the stone
Ceuranon burns without when it freezeth within, and as the Nightingale has a
most sweet voice, but vnfauourie flesh: so there is none so comely in his
body, but may be corrupt in his mind, none so fine in his feature, but may be
faulty in his faith, nor any so loving in his look, but may be lowering in his
heart. Whereupon I think that Tully in his book de Amicitia, considering the
double dealing of men, how they carried most commonly two faces like Ianus
under one hood, having as well wrinkles in the one to prognosticate mishap, as
dimples in the other to signify prosperity: and like the leaves of the
Seaulpher, to be green and beutiful in love and affection outwardly, when
their roots or hearts were withered and dead in good will inwardly, counsels
Scaeuola and Fannius under the person of Laelius above al other things, as the
cheifest principal belonging to find a friend, that they should first multos
modios salis simul edere, etc. meaning that they should be so far from
choosing a friend at the first sight, that they should neither give any their
hearts, nor hands, until by reason of their long acquaintance and conversation
together they might have had time to have eaten many bushels of salt. For
seeing there is nothing more necessary unto the life of man then to be
environed with faithful and unfeigned friends, into whom he may transport his
affections, repose his secrets, and commit his enterprises, so he ought to
bestow the greatest pains and careful industry in the finding of them,
especially in these our present times wherein flattery is become such a common
art and so much practiced of most men, that almost every rusticall companion
and illiterate pesant can represent like a looking-glass what man's quallities
and conditions he will: So that good cause has every one with Ulysses to fear
the incha^ting harmony of sweet singing Sirens, seeing under the fairest flower
often lurkes the foulest serpent and those that profess most liberal affection
in words, are often proved the deadliest enemies in deed. Wherefore not without
good reason did Darius esteem more of his faithful Zaphirus then of his
conquest of an hundred chiefe-taines of his Babilonian enemies, for kingdoms
may be gotten by policy, and enemies subdued by the sword, but an unfeigned
friend by neither to be obtained, wherefore Zeno the philosopher was of this
opinion that the loss of a friend was only to be lamented: which Agesilans the
Greek seems also to affirm, who being demanded why he did more lament the
heaviness of his friends then the death of his children, made answer, I do not
bewail the want of my wife, the loss of my goods, or the death of my children,
for all these are but parts of my self: but I bewail the death of my friend
which is another my self, whose like I am not likely ever to light upon,
seeing true friendship is so seldom seen, and being seen, so greatly admired,
so that we read of Alexander, who for his noble conquests and spacious
regiment, was surnamed the great, that in all the provinces kingdoms, and
empires, which most victoriously he passed through, he found but one faithful
and unfeigned friend named Calistenes: The like we read of Xerxes, Nero,
Dionisius, and many other renowned peers and potentates in the world, who are
not reported to have had any more then one friend. And if we allow of the
counsel of Seneca a wise and discreet man, if he might have many (as he
cannot) yet will not admit any more then one: for if there be danger (says
he) in enemies, there can be no surety in the multitude of friends, seeing in
respect of their number they breed difference of consent and will, with variety
of conditions: and where is no conformity of manners, there can be no
perfection in friendship. Furthermore one friend ought not to say to another, I
will not, or, I can not, since it is a privilege in friendship to find nothing
impossible: therefore who ioynes friendship with another, binds himself not to
deny the thing that his friend requires him to do, seeing in this consists the
full office of friendship, to owe to our friends our selves and all that we have.
But how can a man that is said to have many friends, execute this office of
true friendship, when in the same instance one friend inuites him to a banquet,
and another sends for him being sick: one requests him to plead his cause
against his adversary at London, and another to ride with him about other
affairs to Dover, where you see he can do his duty to no more but one, and
consequently all the rest do seem to be despised, and their friendship little
or not at al regarded: whereby it appears, that true friendship can be only
in the duall number, namely an unfeigned consent of two men's wills and
affections, and a transportation of two hearts into one body: and therefore a
friend is called alter idem, another moity, or another self. The river that is
divided into many brooks, experience shows us the stream to be very slow
and shallow: so love which is divided amongst many cannot be so great as that
which has but one subject to work on: and therefore Homer speaking of a child
whom his, father entirely loves indeed, calls him Solum, atque in senio
natum, that is, his fathers only son, and borne when his parents were past
hope to have any more. Wherefore seeing thou can have but one true friend,
whose bosom must be a place of retract for all thy counsels, opinions, actions,
and interprises, what care and circumspections ought thou to have in
choosing this one. They that try poison by the taste, destroy themselves
therewith, and he that will admit a friend before he knows him, most commonly
hurts himself whilst he proves him, as the Satire thought the fire to be
some great goddess, by reason of the brightness and warmth that it gave, and
therefore would needs embrace it, and kiss it, having burnt his venturous
lips, Prometheus told him the nature and force thereof: so parasites or
flatterers because their words are pleasant to the ear, many embrace them and
commit themselves and all that they have unto them, til having tried their more
secret operation they begin to cry Cave when their coin is consumed, and to
be chary when they have nothing whereof to take charge, then they can tell
others, that men's hearts and tongues, are no perfect relatiues, and that it is
not always true, that what the heart thinks, the tongue clacketh, and can
verify it with a probatum of their own. It were better to be wise too soon
then repent too late, and to look before we leap, lest we fall into their
ditch, for if we are once down, there are few that will lend us their hands to
help us up again and carry us through all the stormy waves of our distress, as
the dolphin did Arion, but every one almost will answer as they did the young
man in Plautus in his necessity, with a Non est, that is, faith friend you come
to a wrong box, I stand in as much need as your self, or as the crow did the
kite, when it happened the one to be bare of feathers, the other answered, that
to him were no more then sufficed him to fly, and yet they will promise one in
his prosperity never to forsake him, as Peter promised Christ, who in a while
after did utterly deny him, and forswear too, therefore not unfitly did
Pliny compare men unto the fifh Palerna, which being passing white in the
calm, yet becomes black at every storm, and like unto the Heban blossoms,
which open with the dew and shut with the sun: so in prosperity they fawn,
but in adversity they fade, they honor the sun at his vprising with the
Egyptians, but curse him at his going down, yea those on whom we bestow the
greatest benefits, if opportunity serve, will requite us with the deadliest
hate. The Trojans never showed more favor unto any then unto wretched Sinon,
who afterward betrayed their city unto the Gaecians: and none was more welcome
unto Carthage, then straggling Aeneas, and yet he repaied them with most
shameful abuses: Seuerus the Emperor never bestowed more benefits upon any,
then on his servant Plautianus, for he made him copartner with him in thempire,
who shamed not for all this to hire Saturninus trecherously to murder his
friend so faithful and lord so loving, Seuerus: The Babilonians never trusted
any more then the forenamed Zopirus who most villanously betrayed them into the
hand of Darius: And Thraso in Terence, never affected man more then his
parasite Gnatho, by whom he was delivered up as a prey to his enemies, with an
hunc ego comedendum and bibendum vobis propino. But if these and the rest whom
we read to have tasted of the same sauce had prudently pondered the sugered
subtilties of the world, they needed not to have locked the door when the
steed was stolen, nor by their own harms to have learned to beware.
Therefore seeing we perceive the trap, let us not foolishly follow the train,
nor swallow the bait, wherein is shrouded the intent of our bane, neither let us
think with the pike to cast up the hook which we have swallowed, when we
please without prejudice to our persons, for if we have once entertained a
knave we shall not easily be rid of him, but presently he becomes like fulsome
meat which we cannot keep in our stomachs, without hurting us, nor vomit it
up alone as it went in, but mingled with other meat, which would have
nourished and cherished us: So when we have received a counterfeit and harbored
him, with our hindrances we can neither continue with him but he will hurt us,
neither shake him off so clearly, but heiwil go better away then he came,
therefore Principijs obsta, take heed at the first, and thou shall do well
enough, believe not at the first that it is gold because it glistreth, neither
swear that the Polipus is white, because he seemed so once unto thee, nor that
such a one is an honest man, because thou never foundest him otherwise: for
Proteus can turn himself into more shapes then one, and Jupiter if he would
compass the love of a fair lady, can turn himself from a bull, into a
shower of gould to deceive simple Danae: so a parasite has more cranckes in
his budget to deceive then one: he has one for the scholar, another for the
courtier, one for the merchant, another for the yeoman, one for this good
fellow, another for that. If he chance to meet with a scholar in the
University troubled with an heavy purse, presently he calls to mind the
saying of S. Paul, that wills us to bear one another burden, and therefore
without delay whilst the spirit knocks he will open, lest be find not so much
grace at another time, and therefore (because birds of a feather will fly
together, and the scholar will trust or believe the scholar, rather then
another) he begins to be as precise as a knave in a cage: first he puts on the
black cloak and the falling hand, then he walks like Bellona in her
equipage, with his eyelids close, he speaks nothing without Propterea quod,
to conclude, all the day he is in contemplation, or rather meditation how he
may best ease his brother of his burden, but if he perceive that he has met
with a wily brother that has read over Plutarch de discrimine adulatoris and
amici, then off goes the black cloak and the long picardeuaunt, and he must
be cut again according to the fashion, then he makes rimes on Platoes crooked
shoulders, and tries how he can scoff at Aristotle's stammering voice. If he
chance to meet Bias somewhat whitteld in an alehouse as he walks alone, as
Struthias did, he commends him highly for ouercomming so many pewter-Iohns, and
tells him how Alexander is as much famous for his quaffing, as Thales, Solon,
Periander, Cleobulus, Chilon, and Pittacus were for their wisdom, yea as
Mison himself, whom Apollo said to be wiser then him. Furthermore he shows
him that a man is not borne only for himself, but also for his neighbors,
and therefore it is a good deed of charity to help a poor ale-wife away
with a dozen of beer next his heart in a morning, also it is good to increase
blood, to quicken the spirit, and so to speak more wisely, and consequently,
to be more esteemed, and therefore wills him to call in the other half dozen,
till at the last he has brought into his fools paradise (his bed I mean)
where he strips him as clean of his come as an ape of a tail, before drunken
Bias can get out of his memento. Again if he fall acquainted with an idle and
shameful magistrate, which cares not (as they say) which end goes foremost, he
tells him magistracy is but a troublesome toiling in other men's business, and
the most profit that a man shall reap thereby, is but a wind of men's mouths,
and the most busy bodies have least thanks, for their labors, and therefore
it were as good, to neither meddle nor make, as to troble himself and be never
the better, but if he perceive him to be very laborious and painful in his
office, he also begins to change his note, and tells him that it is a
pleasant thing to be idle, but very full of discredit, and a man that has
lost his credit, is half hanged etc. If he company with some liberal serving
creature he can guess at his conditions, which are most commonly to swear,
drink, and hunt after whoores, if he be a young practisioner he teaches him
to swill it in, and swear it out, he reproues him friendly if he swear any
base or beggarly oath, as by faith and troth, and as God shall judge him, he
tells him if he love his credit he must thunder them out like Jupiter, or
else he shames himself and al his friends. If he see him not well at ease, he
wishes him to purge himself, if he understand not this mystery, he tells him
more plainly, that for a piece of money he will fetch him a suppositiue out of
petticoate lane that shall make him purge out all the gross humors in his
body. But if he perceive him better disposed, he tells him that he plays the
part of an honest man, and all that he said was naught, but to try him, and if
he had bin bent that way, friendly to have diswaded him from it, by which
means he wins the love and friendship of al men unto himself. But it were a
world to say as much as might be said, and altogether vnneedeful, seeing we
may gather by Hercules his foot, the greatness of his whole body, and by these
few things that flattery is a mystery, which every fool cannot unfold at the
first. But if thou would know the safest and surest way to escape their
fingers, then harken unto the counsel of Epicarmus saying, Esto sobrius ac
memento nulli temere credere, that is, be wise and circumspect in thy dealings,
and believe no man rashly. Into which counsel before we go any further, let us
look more narrowly: of whom does he bid us beware? What? of our enemies? why
there is none so foolish except he be stark mad (I think) as was Aesops cock
that would believe the fox, to follow his counsel, of whom he knows he is
deadly hated, therefore belike he bids us to beware of our friends,
neighbors, and alies, whom no man mistrusts, every one believes and will swear
for their fidelity. Therefore let us call to mind whether our manifest,
sworn, and professed enemies have done us most mischief, or our supposed
friends, our kinsmen, and allies. Surely if we would search into histories
(witnesses of former times) we shall perceive more castles overthrown, cities
overcome, kingdoms and empires utterly wasted and extinguished, by false
hearted friends, and outwardly sworn brethren, then by the mighty hand of
proclaimed ennemies, as Troy suffered more damage in one night by Sinons
fained tears, then by the power of the Graetians in ten years, and more
complaints in adversity of acquaintance and friends, then accusations of
enemies, for against our enemies we furnish our selves by sea and land, we
erect strong and mighty castles on the bordures, we furnish them with men,
and munition, and al things requisite for the defense of our lives, and living,
and therefore we seldom are assaulted, and if we be, we easily overcome, but
among fellow citizens qui ijsdem sacris ac fames vtuntur, there is continual
iangling and brawling, often going to law, yea between brother and brother,
for injuries offered: so that the miserly father who has bin a scraping
together a little pelf al his life time, caring not which way he came by it,
seems to have lived to have set folks together by the ears at his death;
namely, the devils for his soul, and his children for his goods, what then
should a man do to live a quiet and peaceable life, and safe from the snares
and engines of all men? should he sever himself from the company of all men as
Timon the Athenian did? or else should he have no ears like the picture of
Jupiter in Creet, whereby he might be deceived? should he scratch out his eyes
with the Bishop of Alexandria for fear of Venus charms? or with Jews the
second son of Charles, king of France hide himself in corners, to the intent
he might never be intrapped? rather let him harken to the counsel of
Pythagoras, who wishes one gaudere potius repugnantibus quam assentantibus,
rather to trust his professed enemy whom he knows hates him, then his
trencher-friends and pedantical parasites that seem to love him, which will
praise him as the fox did the foolish crow, and call him a white bird as white
as the driven snow, that they may make him open his mouth to sing after their
pipe that they may deceive him of the meat therein: and when they once have
it, will not stick to say, Nec vocem stulte, nec mentem habes, that is,
friend, you might look better to your goods when you had them, and seeing you
were such a fool to lavish them out so fondly, you are like to have a fools
reward, which is a flap with a fox tail. Think not therefore with the
swallow, every sunshine to be a summers day, and every one that shows thee a
fair face, to bear thee inwardly a faithful heart, but think that the
leaves of the Date tree will change their color if the wind be not always in
the same quarter: that Dedalus images will fly away if they be not always
tied, and that flatterers will fade if thou bind them not daily with the bands
of thy purse strings, therefore Dioscorides compares them to the Celedony
stone, which retains his virtue no longer then it is rubbed with gold, and
unto the Marigold which opens her leaves as long as the Sun shines, but
with the least cold begins to close: So when fortune favors a man, they
laugh, when she frowneth on him, they lowre. In prosperity their love is as
hot as Aetna, but in calamity as cold as Caucasus, therefore truly said
Iuuenal: In pretio precium nunc est, dat census honores,
Census amicitias, pauper vbique iacet:
that is, as long as fortune favors thee, thou shall not want fellows, or
as long as thou have any substance thou shall not want accidental adherents,
which will not leave thee sine interitu subiecti, that is, before al thy
substance be wasted and consumed: therefore not unfitly may their love be
compared to the love of the Iuie to the Oak, the Iuie roundeth it self as it
were for pure love about the oak, and never leaves to creep up til it has
advanced it self to the highest of all, and suckte out the sap leaves, and
dried it up, the green leaves in the mean time make a fair and glorious
show, but in the end when it has clunged close and climed aloft it marreth al
both top and truncke: So whilst thou have any coin thou shall not want
copesmats which will make a show that they love thee as their own souls, but
upon this condition, that they may grow up by thee, and live bravely by thy
means, for they are not every knaves companions, they scorn those poor, base
and beggarly brats which are ready to drown themselves with Theognes because
they have no meat to put in their mouths, and they esteem no more of fine
Thraso without pence, then a horse does a fair stable without prouender, this
is their final scope, which is, primum in intention, the first and
principallest thing they aim at, and therefore they hie themselves thither
where it is to be had, namely, among noble and wealthy personages, who having
their closets watered with the Indian or Pactolian fountains, and stored with
such trees as Aeneas plucked a bough off, when he went to visit his father in
the Elifian meades, these they flatter and sooth up in all that they do, do
they never so bad, about these they swarm as thick as flies about butchers
shambles. What a goodly company of them (think you) had the gold-glutted Midas
waiting at his heels, when he was endued with that spirit-gladding gift of
Bacchus, that al which he touched should turn to gold. I warrant ye Cassandra
striued not half so much to sing unto her father Ileons destruction and Queen
Helens rape, as these thronged and striued, who should be next him, for quid
non mortalia pectora cogit auri sacra fames, what will not the omnipotency of
Gold make a man to do, it is the necessariest thing that a man can have, as
Lisander said, what more requisite in wars, and what more needful in peace?
it has entered those cities which neither the thundering threats of fiery
Jupiter, nor the roaring shot of bloody Mars could ever overcome, it is a
friend to al good arts, and a nurse to all notable exploits, for as Aristotle
says impossible est, vt quis praeclaras res agat, cui facultates desunt, it
is as impossible that a man should do any excellent act or worthy of
commendations without the help of money, as to build a church without stone
or timber, therefore quaerenda pecunia primum, first get money, and then all
things else shall be given unto thee: whereas poverty is an enemy to all
goodness, an enemy to honor, and an enemy to honesty, for what causes so
many now a days to get their living by robbing, and stealing, but only
poverty? what provoke many women to sell their honesty at so low a rate, as
usually they do, but only poverty? what causes the merchant to lie, the coiner
to clip, the tailour to steal, the usurer to oppress, and the parasite to
purloine, but only poverty? name but only poverty, and thou have named
almost the root of al evils, therefore is it shunned as a Basilike of al men,
whose sight presently kills, wherefore few or none at al will lend a look on
a poor and needy man, but will shun his company as near as they can, yea even
the lice the senceles creatures of all will avoid a man when his blood is
gone, and the flesh is cold, which was their food: how then can thou
persuade thy self, that a man which is a reasonable creature will stay thee?
when thy purse is cold, thy cheer is cold, and his entertainment therefore of
necessity is cold. Moreover, it is some men's opinion that the Devil will haunt
such as have no cross about them, how then will thou think that any man will
stay with thee, if thou have never a cross about thee to keep the devil away,
doubt not then but they will leave thee when thy crosses are spent in thy
extremity, and therefore trust them not too much in thy prosperity, when they
flatter and speak thee fair, but remember that after the greatest calm will
follow the suddenest storm, that Nilus is most quietest against a deluge, that
the feathers of the Halciones glister most against foul weather, and that when
men speak most fair, then they intend most mischief. It is not so common a
saying as true, aliquid latet quod non patet, every man is not as he seems to
be, the arrant knave is often taken for the honester man, and Critius sometimes
will choose a gilden box full of bones, before a leaden one full of precious
gems, for men judge only by the outward appearance and protestations of men,
and so choose an empty barrel for his louder sound, before a full vessel of
pleasant liquor, and believe subtle Rodeyan because she can tell the smoother
tale before simple Cordeill, and prefer deceitful Ulysses for his eloquent
tongue before faithful Ajax a mirror of manhood. But as the Trojans bewailed
their rashness in believing too late, when their city was metamorphosed into
ashes, and the Graetians repented their judgment when their valiant captain
was turned into a flower, so unless thou art more considerate then the Trojans,
and less rash then the Graetians, thou may have just cause one day to rue
thy leaping when thou lie in the ditch. Miserrimum est (says one) fuisse
bearum it is the greeuousest thing in the world for a man in his misery to
remember his former felicity, labor therefore to avoid this hellish dolor,
which unless thou take heed, thou art like to fall into. The dear knowing
Tamariske is deadly to his nature, will not come near the tree. The Unicorn
will not brook to rest under the Citron tree, for that it is hurtful unto him,
neither will any beast come near the Panther for all his fair skin, since they
know by experience that he is a murderer, these beasts avoid what nature tells
them is perilous, be not therefore less senceles then the beasts of the field,
but let experience be thy guide when affections persuade the contrary,
remember what credulous Phillis wanne, by believing demure Demophoon, but only
her death, what got Crassus by trusting his parasite Andromachus, but to be
betrayed to the Parthians? and what wanne Catiline by opening his conspiracy,
but the loss of his life and honor? and what are thou like to get by trusting
of flatterers, but the loss of thy goods, the extinguishment of thy arms, the
derision of thy enemies, and the curse of thy posterity? therefore cast them
off from thee as infectious vipers, and salute them a far off, as Hippolitus
did Venus, because he would not be entangled, and if thou must needs company
with them, if their words be like Adamant, whose nature is to draw, then
sprinkle thee with goats blood, which resists his operation: and if their
faces have power to incense thy mind, then take the herb Lupinar to cool thy
desire, if the Sirens allure thee, let the maste withhold thee, if Circes
persuade thee, let reason dissuade thee, if thou would kiss the Be,
because she has honny in her mouth, yet let her alone, because she has a
sting in her tail: if thou would embrace Pallas, because she shows thee
her library, yet be not too bold, because she wears a sword: and if thou
love a man for his affection toward thee now, yet trust him not over boldly
lest he hate thee to morrow, and make open thy secrets: what is more common
then dessentio^ amongst friends, and variance between brethren, so that they
that love to day as truly as Turtles, to morrow upon the least occasion, as if
they had drunk of the fountain of Ardenia, their hot love will be turned to as
cold a liking? We need not borrow examples from former ages or antiquity, for
(alas) every city. town, and village, can lend us whole legions of them, how
one friend has slain another, how the father the children, and children have
slain their fathers, yea they do not only not abstain from murdering their
dearest friends and nearest in blood, but also if they be defeated of their
will, or injured of one of whom they know not how to be revenged, they will not
fear to kill themselves, as Ajax did being defeated by Ulysses of Achilles
armor. Therefore how should we think that they will always love us, when they
will hate themselves, seeing every one loves himself better then another,
according to the old proverb, Near is my petticoate, but nearer is my smock,
I love thee well, but I love my self better: think not then that there is any
such a Gordian knot of unfeigned friendship knit so fast to day, but there may
be an Alexander to cut it in pieces at one time or other: nor any such a
solemn league made between Priamus and Menelaus, but there is a Pandorus
somewheare or other that will break and dissolve it: nor any such a Simpathy of
affections to day, but there may be an Antipathy by some chance or other, ere
the year is gone about. The sea sometimes is so calm and quiet, that the
fearefullest that is will seem to despise and contemn the force thereof; but
therefore have the sailers less need to carry with them their ankors and
cabelles and other things needful, when winds should arise? no surely, for
although Aeolus sleep for a while and will disquiet no man else, and suffers
Phoebus to domineere as sole Regent, yet if he perceived him wax too hot in
his pride, he begins to moderate his affections commonly with a cooling card
or twain, by his tempestuous ambassadors to put him in mind that he is a king
as well as himself, and although sometimes in his anger he roareth and is
testie, yet he will not altogether be shut out for a wrangler. In like manner
they that follow thy humors for a while in flattering thee with the Panther, in
smiling on thee with the Hiena, and weeping with the Crocodile at thy mishaps,
and that are ready to make themselves thy footestoole in lowly obedience as the
Ciprian women were to the Syrian dames, which would cower down and become
footestooles for the Ladies to ascend into their choches (for which cause they
were called Climacidae of Climacha, which the Assirians name a ladder) but when
they see their time they will of steps become steppers, til they are got so high
that they are become as good men as their masters, and then for one taunt will
not stick to give them twain. I cannot resemble them better, then unto the
lake in the farthest part of Africa amongst the people Troglotidae which in
the forenoone is so sweet and pleasant to the taste, that the gods themselves
might seem to loath the celestial Nectar in respect thereof: but when the sun
is gone past, the meridian climate it will be as bitter and unsavory as our
wells are in Nantewich, which are good for naught but to make salt: So whilst
the glorious sun of thy prosperity continues his ascension, whilst riches
increase and fortune looks favorably, they will kiss thee with Judas, and
stoop to thee with dissembling Adrastus: but when the golden beams of thy
beutiful Sun, begin to decrease, and thou art not able any longer to make
the^ stoop unto thee, with the golden scepter with Assuerus, they will begin to
despise thee, and forsake thee, or else lay hands on thee for a vagabond, as
they did on Christ when he walked alone in the dark. Then might he have said
with the Poet:

Qui color albus erat nunc est contrarius albo. Now I perceive when the angels
crowned me with glory and honor in the mount, they were desirous to make their
tabernacles there to dwell with me, and when I rode triumphantly toward
Jerusalem, these plucked off their garments to spread them in my way, and to
run before like heralds crying, Hosanna, Hosanna, blessed be he that comes
in the name of the Lord. But going on foot, my disciples to whom I revealed al
my secrets which I kept from the wise and prudent men of the world, whom I
thought would rather have been rackte to death with Horatius Secundus to have
manifested their constancy, have now either forsaken me, or betrayed me, or
sworn they never knew me: these other spit at me, take my garments from me,
and curse me, or crucify me: so unless thou take the better heed whom thou
trustest, thou may have cause one day to say; those to whom I committed all the thoughts and secrets of my heart, whom I thought would never have bewraied
me, do now seek to kill me if they could, those who flattered me in my
prosperity, and were ready to run through fire and water to get my favor or
good will to grace them, do labor only to disgrace me, those whom I fed with my
goods as long as I could, as willingly as the Pelican does her young ones, with
her own blood, do now tear my heart with taunts like as young Vipers gnawe
their dams guts which bred them. Res est ingeniosae dare, I was an honest
gentleman as long as I had any money in my purse, but now having spent al upon
them, they turn me out of their company as a shake-ragge, as the Athenians
turned Theseus out of Athens which he builded on his own charges and bestowed
upon them, which things do more vex and trouble me, then those grievous gripes
of the Eagle do Tantalus in hell, he was punished justly because he bewraied
the secrets of the gods: but I most unjustly, seeing I never disclosed any
thing which they told me in counsel and put me in trust with, they are not
unlike the stone Siphnius, which being heated in oil waxes hard, but being
let alone becomes soft, so the more I have pleasured them, the more do they
now displease me, and the more I have bestowed upon them, the more is their
hearts hardened against me. Now I perceive that the sweetest musk is sower to
be tasted, the finest pills, most bitter to be chewed, and the flatteringst
friend most fickle being tried: and now I understand that the fairest promises
have least performances, and that words are but wind, and therefore not
sufficient pledges for such an inseparable knot of friendship. But alas, sero
sapiunt Phriges, what good will my salve do me when my sore is incurable? what
avails it me to know a covert, my ship being sunkt, and to discern a
dissembler, when my coin is consumed. Although this be but a fained speech,
yet thou that flourishest now in thy peacocks plumes, and have angels enough to
keep thee from poverty, and have as many friends (as thou supposest) as
Prometheus ever had shapes, and do daily increase like Hidraes heads, yet if
thou take not heed whom thou trust, thou may walk alone one day like a
shorn sheep, bleating forth such a complaint of thine own. Remember the
example of Edward the second, I warrant thee he would once have sworn that he
should never have stood up to the ears in the filthy kennel of Killingworth,
till he was ready to starve for meat, and lastly should have been murdered
so beastly and basely. But his too tender heart toward his yonkers and wanton
flatterers brought him to this, who made him abhor like Rohoboam, the
counsel of his dear friends and grave senators, and so to run headlong
into all vices and villainies, unbeseeming a Prince or governor of a common
wealth who is a rule unto al his subjects, after which they square out their
actions and affections, as the Poet says, Regis ad exemplum totus componitur
orbis, that is as we say, Like master, like man, if the Prince be vicious, al
his subjects (for the most part) are as bad or rather worse, as when Traian was
just al his subjects loved justice, and in Heliogabalus days, al were wanton
and given to gluttony and leachery, in that he was a glutton, and a drunkard,
and one that loved a whore as well as his life: but again to our matter. Let
Edwards example teach us to beware how we listen to any Calipsoes that seek
naught but our downefal, and how we entertain al fair faces that come unto us
like capons, upon sops and sugar, seeing so many an unsavory weed bears a
fair blossom, and a sound look so often couers a hollow heart, but let us
look into the inward man, as Diogenes did into Platoes capon, to see if he
were a man in all respects, which if we do, no doubt we shall find many a wolf
walking in a sheep coat, many a stinking carcass enclosed within a glorious
sepulcher, and many a Tigers heart shadowed over with an Hienaes face. Conon
the Athenian was a courteous gentleman in countenance, yet a counterfeit knave
in conditions: Galba was gentle in show, yet treacherous in proof: and Ulysses
had a saire tongue, but a false heart, wherefore it behooves us to look that
the inside of the cup be clean, as well as the outside, to see that the Amber
stone freeseth not within, when it frieth without, and to try whether a man's
properties be agreeing to his profession, lest like Ixion we take hold on a
cloud when we think to embrace Juno, and choose grapes in show like those of
Darius vine, and loose grapes in substance like those of Vermandois, and abound
with friends in words when we think to be environed with friends indeed. A
man is as his mind is, not that form and figure which may be pointed at, we
see many a proper man's hand strocke off for a traitor, and many more should be,
if we could know them by the faces, but their countenance shall be great, when
their conditions be without grace, they will talk of virtue, when their mind is
about same other villainy, like as our maidens do now a days, which with their
tongues will sacrifice perfumes to Vesta, when their hearts are offering smoking
thoughts to Venus, so that without good trial it is almost impossible to know
of what metal they are made. Zancthus the Philosopher surely bought not Aesop
before Cappadox and Cantor, for his outward perfections, but for his inward
perfection, not for the shape of his body, but for the qualities of his mind,
not for that he was the fairest of the three, but the faithfullest of them all,
not for that he promised much, but that he saw he could perform most: est
virtus placidis (says the poet) abstinuisse bonus, it is better sometimes to
take the rugged Iem, before the pearl, and to buy the fowlest face before the
fairest visage. Perhaps Cantor and his companion were not unlike the Seaster,
whose shell staineth the iuory, but the meat is blacker then Iet: so they were
not so fair without, but they were as foul within, and they had not so comely
countenances, but they had as currish conditions. So choose thou not a friend
by the outward shapes if thou be a Philosopher or a lover of wisdom, but as
nere as thou can by his inward graces, which knowing, thou may see whether
thou can frame thy mind, according unto his mind, wherein consists the
perfections of friendship, which if thou can not, then look for nothing in
contraries but always repugnancie, and in diverse conditions nothing but
variancie. The tygres blood will not be mingled with the wolfes. Zethis and
Amphion will not agree as long as the delight of the one be a despite to the
other. Venus also and Vesta have always bin at strife; and never was good
fellowship long seen ere yet between a virtuous husband and a vicious wife,
but the devils for their likeness do easily agree, and good men with good men do
live together in unity, therefore to discern the inward qualities it is
necessary that thou put off thy Moles eyes, and take unto thee the eyes of the
sharp sighted Linx, else thou shall never discrie with Palamed Ulysses mad
counterfaiting, nor discern Achilles from a chambermaid if he be once decked
with a spindle and a distaffe, nor judge of Androgeni (those flattering
copesinates I mean) that can counterfeit the shape of either kind, who when
they are indeed thy enemies, are in countenance friends, when they are in name
mothers, are in deed murderers, by birth brothers, but in life lothers and
haters one of another. Medea was in name a mother unto her three children, and
oftentimes prayed unto the gods for the prosperous and long life of them al,
yea many times she tormented her self, and tore her hair for very grief when
she perceived them a little sick, but do these things make that she murdered
them not with her own hands? but thou will say she did it in her anger, which
does deprive us of the use of reason, that we do we know not what, therefore
will thou think that he that is now thy friend, may not hereafter be as much
thy foe, seeing there is no man but may be angry if he have any life in him, as
Plutharch says?

Iram non habet, qui mentem non habet. Therefore if mothers become murderers
and butchers of their own children when they are angry, think not but the
hottest love may be soon cold, and he that is now ready to go with thee
through al dangers, as Achates went with Aeneas, and Perithous with Theseus,
yet if they see any preferment to be gotten an other way, they will leave thee
in all thy sorrows as Aeneas did Dido, although he promised never to forsake
her when his ships were vnrigged, and his men without victual, but some man
will say, this man was a stranger unto her, and therefore she was served well
enough to believe on whom she never saw before, but I will believe none but mine
own acquaintance and those that I know. But has every hurt bin offered by
strangers? have none but strangers spoiled thee of thy goods? have none but
strangers murdered and slain one another? have not kinsmen and brothers,
fathers and children, murdered and spoiled one another, was not Atreus brother
unto Thiestes and uncle unto the children whom he slew and caused the father
to feed on? was not Herraclus the Emperor son unto Phocas whom he caused
to be slain? was not Geta the Emperor brother unto Bassianus whom he slew in
the temple in his mothers arms? but if consanguinitie could have prevailed,
these should have loved more then any else: and if consanguinitie could have
prevailed, Artaxerxes should not have bin slain with the whole consent of his
115. children, nor Phrahartes would have slain his father and his 30.
brethren, nor Remu* should have bin slain by Romulus for so small an occasion
as leaping over a wall, nor Clytemnestra would have murdered her husband for
the love of a stranger. But let us pass over these examples, for it is
impossible to reckon up al which histories have notified, but much more
impossible to recapitulate how many unknown Atrei and Bassiani and unnatural
Phrahartes, how many Aeropes, Clytemnestraes, and falshearted Sthuebaeas have
and do daily lurk in the world, when as every town and village is stuffed
almost as full with them, as the Trojan horse was with butchering Graecians.
The world is far changed from that it has bin (if it be true Plutarch
reports) when men would offer violence to none but hurtful beasts, yea and
thought it an heinous offense to lay hands on any other: but in awhile after
they began (says he) to kill the innocent birds, and silly fish, of which when
they had felt the sweetness, they spared not the ox which labored for them,
nor the simple sheep which gave them clothing; so that in the end they began
to lay hands on mankind also, beginning with the worst, as we read: the first
that ever was slain in Athens was one Epitedeus, a most wicked sycophant; such
also were the second and third: but when their hands were somewhat inured
therewith, they slew the virtuous Niceratus, the noble emperor Theramenes; and
the most learned philosopher Polimarchus, and in thend, the son spared not
the father, nor the father the son, the brother the sister, nor ye daughter the
mother, so that use has made them so cunning, that men now adays make it an
occupation, and will glory in the deed with the barbarous Scythians, who are
wont (as Bohemus reports) to make them handkerchefs of the skin which they
flea from the head of man, and of the sculles to make measures or goblets to
drink in, and when any ghest comes, they use to set before him as many sculles
full of wine as they have, and declare it for a great brag of their
valiantness, that so many they have slain. Wherefore seeing consanguinitie is
made such a trifle, how foolish or rather stark mad may we think those men
are, that suppose by the meeting ni the market place, or the communing together
over a pot in an alehouse, a perpetual friendship to be joined from that day
forward between them? They think that vestis virum facit, that a suit of
silks make a right worshipful gentleman, and a Mercurian-glosing tongue a
faithful and unfeigned friend: but they remember not that Simia est simia
etiamsi aurea gestat insignia, that an ape is an ape although he wear a chain
of gold about his neck; and a knave is a knave, although his tongue distilles
nothing but Nectar, they hold it for a general rule that Sermo est animi index,
that a filthy fountain can send forth no pleasant water, and an envious heart
no friendly words, and therefore that the dog never biteth but only when he
barketh, nor the serpent never stings but only when she hisseth, nor that any
man is their enemy, but he that reproues or chideth them for their faults:
which indeed is the property of an unfeigned friend, namely to do that that is
behoueful, to order his words like a skilful physician, does his medicines as
he sees occasion, who sometimes will cut and launch the flesh, and when need
so requires will anoint it with soft and pleasant oil, but both ways
tending to one end, viz. that the patient may be healed: so one friend
sometimes will praise and highly commend the other when he sees him do well
that hereby he may bring him to love, and long after those things which are
honest, and profitable: for honos alit arts (as Tully says) omnesque
incenduntur ad studia gloria, honor and praise are spurs unto virtue, and cause
us to think nothing difficult to be achieved, nor impossible to be performed,
and therefore men undertake so great burdens upon them in the common wealth,
only to get the praise and commendations of men, and to be renowned after
their death, but neglect those things oftentimes which are dishonest, although
they be perhaps far more profitable, and therefore when he sees him do
amiss he reprehends him secretly for it, and lays before him the shame and
dishonor which he should reap if it were known, yea sometimes he separates
himself from him, and will not suffer him to come into his company, as
Menedemus did shut his son out of doors for his riotousnes, until he was
more sober, or Arcesilaus railed on Battus, and bannished him the schools,
because he made verses against Cleantes: but afterward when Battus was sorry
for his fault and made Cleantes amends, he took him into his favor again,
and used him more courteously then ever he did before. Therefore as Agesilaus
could not abide to be praised of any, but of those that would dispraise him
sometimes if occasion required: So is he to be esteemed a true and faithful
friend, which has learned to reprove as well as soothe, and to make us sad, as
well as glad, and therefore we ought to have those in suspicion, which always
are pleasant with us, and sooth us up in all that we say or do, and to have at
our fingers end that saying of the Lacedemonian, Quomodo hic bonus esse potest
qui ne malis quidem acerbus est? how can this man be a friend unto me for my
virtues, and is not an enemy unto me for my vices? This therefore is a mark
to distinguish between a friend and a flatterer, whereas the one is our friend
only in things honest meet and requisite, the other in all things whatsoever
to the intent he may not displease us. But some man perhaps thinks that he
lives so uprightly that he needs none to reprehend him, and therefore to go
the surest way to work, his companion and he will be sworn brothers by some
deep oath which they think no man will wittingly or willingly break, since the
gods themselves as Jupiter said to Semele, dare not in any wise violate their
oath, or go back from their vow which they made to any one. But men nowadaies
are so far to be like the gods, that they are almost as bad as devils, for of
all things that belong to the enlargement of their living they think nothing
more necessary then an oath whereby they may deceive. By this means Phillip
king of Macedonia wanne more cities in a month, then he slew men in the open
field manfully in a year, and therefore was wont to say, that his soldier
Perjury did him more service then al his army besides. The like opinion held
Lisander the Lacedemonian, when any objected against him his cowardly cosoning
of his enemies by oaths, a thing which Hercules nor any valiant man could ever
abide, was wont to answer them Si quo non pertingerit pellis leonina afsuendum
and vulpinam: If I think them too good for me in open field I will put in
practice, my ouer-reaching policy. Yea not only kings and men of the more
dissolute sort do defend and offend in this heinous sin of perjury, but also
priests, prelates, and religious men, yea even Gods vicar himself (the Pope I
mean) who has taken upon him the name to sit in Gods feate (if he do, it is
to keep God out of it) but indeed wears the devils badge or colison, which
is lying and perjury. In their baptism they faithfully promised to stand up
against all the devils in hell, but at receiving their popish degrees, they have
and do daily forswear the verity of God, they have sworn to obey their
temporal magistrates, and civil governors, but when they come to the papal
degree, they break both oath and alleagance to al, whatsoever. Search but the
chronicles and thou shall find as many examples as ever there were popes: but
lest we should say any more then we could prove, let us look into the life
of twain of the godliest that ever were among them, namely Paschalis and
Alexander the third: Paschalis swear most deeply to be true unto Henry the
fourth Emperor, but in a while after when he saw his opportunity, he called a
general sinode, whereas by the help of his spiritual sorcerers breaking both
oath and vow of allegiance, excommunicated the good emperor, raised his son
against him, deposed him, imprisoned him, murdered him, and finally caused his
body to be taken out of the ground at Leodium, and in a profane place to be
buried. The like did Alexander the third, who made the good king Fredericus
Barbarossa his footestoole at Venice, to the ridiculous shame and rebuke of all the world, and the next day to hold his stirrup, and like a page to wait on
his mule, to whom he had once sworn al homage and obedience: but if a man
should reprehend them for it, I think they would have none other excuse but
that of Euripides, iuraui lingua, mentem iuiuratam gero, I swear with my lips,
but not from my heart, and therefore I do not offend, for God only regards
the heart and inward man, believe not therefore any man the sooner for his
swearing, for as it is an infallible axiom that omnis homo est mendax, every
man is a liar, so every liar before he would be found to trip in his tale, will
not stick to uphold it with oaths enough, if it be a matter of importance, and
stand on his bare affirmation or negation. But perhaps thou will object unto me
the example of Regulus, who rather then he would incur that heinous sin of
wilful perjury, would throw himself voluntarily into most miserable
captivity, and to be hewn in pieces by his most savage and unmerciful
enemies. But I think if thou would go forward in recapitulation of
examples, thou would quickly be brought to a non plus, seeing few of these
Phaenixes are to be found in the world, especially in these our present times:
perhaps in former ages some were to be found when laws were made for
punishing swearers, therefore it were good that those laudable constitutions of
penalties which were made in former times, were renewed again, lest custom
grow into nature, and so never be rooted out. King Alonso amongst many other
laudable and notable laws made this also, that knights of the band should
maintain their words and keep fidelity unto their friends: and in case it
were proved, that any knight of the same band had not accomplished his oath,
although it were given to a very base person, and upon a matter of little
weight, yet such a one should go alone in the Court and unaccompanied, nor
should presume to speak or to approach nere any knight of the same band. Henry
the fifth made a law somewhat more general, which touched, not only knights of
the band, but all other degrees and conditions of people within his court
whatsoever: namely, that if he were a duke that did swear he should forfeit for
every oath forty shillings, to the aiding of poor people: if he were a lord or
baron twenty shillings: if he were a knight or esquire ten shillings: if he
were a yeoman ten groates: if he were a page or a slave, to be scourged
naked with a rod or a whip: which being for a while strictly executed, caused
swearing to be greatly abated in the court, but it did no good at all in the
country. And therefore king Edmond decreed, that all men of all degrees, and
of al places whatsoever, which were proved to have sworn, should for ever be
separated from Gods congregation: but Donaldus king of the Scots perceiving
this law to be little esteemed, and for that men then (as they now) cared not
how seldom they went to the church, made this act, that all periurers and
common swearers should have their lips seared with a hot burning iron: which
law saint Lodowike king of France did put in execution at Paris upon a citizen
for blaspheming the name of Christ to the example of all others, and so caused
it to be proclaimed throughout his whole realm for a general punishment. In a
while after Philip earl of Flanders hearing that the French men had banished
swearing clean out of their coasts, thought good that some were made in like
manner in his land for the reformation of his people, and therefore (because he
would not seem to borrowe any of the laws of the French men his professed
enemies in those days) he purposed to ordain some other as grievous as that,
which without delaie he did, which was, that he that did swear or forswear
himself, should loose his life and goods, and his children should be
disinherited: which law if it were kept in these days, I think there should
so many loose their lives that there should be few or none at al left alive to
inherit their goods, that were of age to know what to do with them, but they
are now al laid aside, and we count him no gentleman except he can swear by
creature and creator, the tale shall want his due circumstance if it be not
garnished and polished with oaths and blasphemy. We read that the Jews when
they heard Gods name blasphemed, were wont to tear their hair and rent their
garments for grief, but who now a days shows any token that he is
discontented therewith? the pope himself who would feign be esteemed the
holiest of al, is not only content that men should swear and forswear
themselves, but also when he sees them somewhat flacke, he hireth them to
forswear themselves; as for example he hireth the subjects to break their
oaths of allegiance to their Princes, as Zachary the first hired the French
men to rise up against their loving prince Hildericke, and Honorius the third,
and John the 22. hired the Germans to break their oths which they had made
unto their emperors; and Innocent the third procured the Englishmen to go from
their allegiance which they had made unto their good king John; and of late
days we have oftentimes bin intised with manifold promises, by his damnable
senate and ungodly Catholics, to renownce our oaths of duty and obedience to
our most gracious and virtuous princess that now is (whom God long preserve
and continue amongst us) and has promised by his messengers, as doctor
Harding, and diverse others of late days, that they should have full pardon for all
their sins (which is to be feared he will never get himself) that could by any
means rid her of her life, which caused many of that cursed seed of Cham, as
Westmerland, Northumberland, the duke of Norffolke, Sanders, Bristow Campion,
Parry, Savage, and many other firebrands of hell, to put in practice this
diuilish decree. When he bare the supremacy here in Q. Mary's days, his
persuasions so persuaded them* that the chief sort made no conscience of
swearing, because by their money they thought they might be pardoned when they
would, and the poorer sort following the example of their superiors, lived as
they did, and so like sinful Sodomites lived together in darkness, bringing
forth most plenteously the works of darkness, which were so fast rooted in the
hearts of most men, as they could not to this day be so clean rooted out, but
that their venall sin of blasphemy has flourished to this day, so that now we
are become far worse then the heathen perjured Glaucus, for he went to the
oracle of Apollo, to know if he might forswear the pawn which was delivered
him to keep: but who now adays consults, either with Apollo, or Minerua, or
any god else, about perjury? yea they fear not to swear and forswear
themselves for single money, though the God of gods command the contrary:
therefore believe not any the sooner, for that he swears love and fidelity to
thee, but think that if he could see his opportunity, he would deal no better
with thee then Achilles did with his old companion Licaon, whom he hewed into
as many pieces with his fawchon, as he swear to him oaths of perpetual
brotherhood, by Ceres when they were chamber-fellowes together in Greece, he
had rather quarter him then loose a quarter of so fair a prey, whose example
the false Aegistus imitated, who thought it better to dispatch Agamemnon of his
life, even when he was offering sacrifices to the gods, then his love to
Clitemnestra should be any whit cut off, or diminished, which he did not only
of his own accord, but by the consent of cruel Clitemnestra, who would not
suffer his eyes to be shut, or any other ceremonial rite to be performed: how
far unlike was she unto the women amongst the Indians called Catheis, who
when the husband dies, al his wives assemble before the chiefest judges of the
city, and there each one alleges her well deserving toward him, how dearly
she loved, and how much she tendered and honored him, and she that is judged to
have borne her self best in that behalf decketh her self in the best manner,
and the most gorgeously she can, triumphing and rejoicing, gets herself up
upon the funeral pile where her husbands corpse lie to be burned, where
imbrasing and kissing him, she is burned with him. But Clitemnestra is of a
right contrary opinion, wherefore the poets feign, that Agamemnon meeting
Aeneas in hell, grievously complains of her unnatural fact, and wishes him
never to believe a woman in any wise, neither was Clitemnestra so cruel unto
her husband because she was a woman, but because she was a most wicked and
unnatural woman, therefore we may believe a woman as well as a man: but such as
man's natural condition and quality that he always hates him, and bids
others beware of any thing by which he has bin endamaged or received any
evil, as whom a serpent has stung, he will always fear and bid others beware
of the serpent, and whom a dog has bitten he will always avoid the fawning of
dogs. In like manner are we affected one toward another, have we been hurt
by a woman, then we exclaim against and bitterly ban al woman kind? has our
friend bin murdered or our selves spoiled by our ghests, as Euritus was slain
by Hercules, Lucrece deflowred by Tarquine, and Menelaus robbed of his wife and
goods by Alexander, from that day forward we will scarce lodge any more ghests,
another has bin hurt by his brother, an other by his children. But it is but a
folly to reckon up particulars, seeing not only brothers, and kinsmen,
strangers and acquaintance are wont to endamage and deceive one another, but
almost al men in general. Wherefore if thou be wise mistrust al whatsoever. Do
as the Esseis which were a kind of sects amongst the Jews, who admitted no man
into their sect under a year of probation, and after what time they had
received him, yet had they two years more to prove his manners and conditions:
so make not any of thy counsel over hastily. Does he say he is thy brother? yet
see thou mistrust him, does he tell thee of his honest behavior and virtuous
life? yet see thou mistrust him, have thou found in him some properties of an
honest man, and unfeigned friend? yet take some more time of trial and watch him
never the less narrowly in the mean while: for that which is said of fortune
may be said more fitly (in my opinion) of man, that none knows whether he
shall be like himself to morrow or no. Therefore if a man by trusting another
has received any hurt, he is to be counted a very ass, if he should blame
him that has deceived him, when there is none to be blamed but himself and
his own foolishnes. Thressa might very well have laughed at Thales, when he
fell into the ditch, if he had beaten the stones, or found fault with his feet
when he should have bin angry with himself, that had not an eye unto his
steps: and Darius might justly have scoffed at Goraldus, when he had never a
penney in his purse, if he had laid the fault upon his companions, who
allured him to lavish, when the fault was his own that would not beware of
them. But some man will say, thou seem to bid me live solitary like a beast
void of al company when thou would have me to believe any man? No, I
counsel thee not to leave thy life in solitariness, but to live warily and
circumspectly, as one that has learned to live well and happily: otherwise it
is far better to live in the desert amongst brute beasts, then to live in the
city without circumspection and warines in all thy actions, and affections,
but by these two thou may live as safely as if thou were alone. There is no
herb to perilous which has not some one virtue that is precious, nor no
serpent so infectious, which is not moved with some one quallitie which is
commodious. What is worse to the thirsty then the brinish Sea water, and yet
what more commodious to the painful fishermen? and what more hurtful to the
foolish swains, then the venomous viper? but to the skilful druggiers, what
more profitable? seeing from her they have the most wholesome triacle: so
although company keeping be very hurteful unto some, yet to othersome it may be
very profitable, and a schoolmaster to wisdom. The wise and prudent man when
he sees every one as an enemy ready to devour him, he will then be more wary
and look better about him, and when he sees every one prying like Momus into
his life and conversation, he will then begin to live as uprightly as Io lest
watchful Argus should find him tripping: but the fool mistrusting no man is
quickly eaten up alive amongst them. What is the reason that Saturn of all the
other gods lay bound in the bonds of Briareus, but because he was the most
blockish and witles of all the other, and could scarsely look about him in the
space of thirty years? if thou art such a one, thou will quickly lie ensnared
in the traps of parasites, and lie fast fettered in the chains of penury. If
Acteon have lost the outward shape of a man, his own dogs will devour him,
and if thou have lost the inward shape of a man, which is reason or pollitike
prudence, thine own friends will not spare to devour thee, or spoil thee of
thy goods. Nothing provoke the thief sooner then negligencie: if the
Athenians had tied care and circumspection to their words and actions, they had
neither fallen into the mouths of the Lacedaemonians nor had cause to fear
their malice, and therefore Job says factus sum mihimetipsi grauis, meaning,
that the evils which do happen unto us (for the most part) our selves do
procure them, Phaeton by his own foolishness was stricken from heaven with a
thunderbolt, and Icarus by his own folly was drenched in the Ocean, and the
Scythians by their own unadvisedness in drinking the wines (which Cirus
pretending flight had caused to be left behind him) were in their drunkenes
overcome by the Persians. Vulcanes nets were not made for Apollo, Mercury, or
Pallas, but for heady Mars, and love blinded Venus, these lay quickly entangled
therein, and were made a laughing to all the other gods: so flatterers vaites
are not laid forth to catch wise men and circumspect, but to ensnare fondlings
and idiots, who presume so much of their honesty, that they think it would go
against any man's conscience to eoosin them, but so long goes the pitcher to the
brook that at the length it comes broken home, and so long do they trust, that
in the end they can scant find any one to trust them when they are fallen into
poverty for the worth of a dodkin: the fair promises, which were made them
once, will not any whit profit the^, Pollicitis dives quilibet esse potest,
says Ovid, if promise would make a man the richer, we should have but few
beggars, poor Codrus would frolic it out, as bravely as Craesus, and needy
Thraso when he went a begging should have as many attendants as ever he had
before, but now he perceives that the poet said true, Tempora cum fuerint
nubila solus eris, that no penny, no pater noster, that a man cannot be a free
man in Wales although he has sacrificed a whole bed of Leekes unto saint
Dauie, nor that a man can be entertained in his poverty, amongst whom he has
spent all that ever he had in his prosperity. Dionisius wished that he might
be poor and distressed one year before he died, to try who would prove
constant of al those manifold troops of men, which vowed him such singular
affection; it was to be feared that he should have found as few as Perithous
did when he was persecuted by the Lapithans, namely, one only Theseus, or as
few as Eurialus had when he fell amongst the soldiers of Turnus, many promised
never to forsake him, but only Nisus stood to his word; the rest presently
changed their notes, as the bird Acanthis does her fine white color at the
first storm: they could have bin content to have bin partakers of their
liberty, but not of their bondage: of their wealth, but not of their woe: of
their prosperous success, but not of their distress: wherefore shun the
company of such kind of men, and if thou art acquainted with them unawares,
shake them off presently as Paul did the viper, lest a worse thing happen unto
thee, and stop thy ears against their inticements* as Ulysses did against the
inticements of Circes lest thou be transformed from wealth into woe, from
bliss into bale, and from joy into annoy. Tantalus apples had a gallant show,
but being touched, turned into ashes: and he that shows himself outwardly a
demi-god, who tries him inwardly, shall find him but a solemn saint. Their
lips (says Solomon) drop as an honey comb, and their mouths are more soft
then oil, but the end of them is as bitter as gall, and as sharp as a two
edged sword: and David says, the poison of aspis is under their lips, which
kills a man when it has cast him into a pleasant slumber. But if thou
would avoid this evil, then take away all the occasions: keep not company
with them: company keeping is the occasion of most evils: he which handles
pitch can not choose but be defiled therewith, and he that keeps company with
evil men, can scarce choose but he infected with their manners: God never
appeered unto Abraham as long as he dwelt with the wicked in Hu^, but afterward
when he went to dwell elsewhere, he oftentimes appeared unto him: and Judas
Machabaeus as soon as he entered friendship with the wicked Gentiles, he was
soon overcome: so if thou suffer thy self to be lulled in the cradle of
flattering Calipso, and give thy hand unto every one that flatters thee, be
sure the God of goods will presently forsake thee, and suffer thy wealth in a
moment to be wracked. Yet do I not condemn company keeping altogether with
our enemies: for sometimes we get much good by them, and learn to know our
own imperfections by them, which otherwise we should never have known.
Hierons enemy could quickly smell his stinking breath, and mock him with it,
which made him presently seek a remedy; whereas his wife that had lived with
him many years before could never perceive so much, for amor cecutit in eo
quod amat, love wa^eth in blood in those things that he loves, as two men
walking in a mist, can not perceive that they are in it, but he that is out of
it, may easily perceive that they are in it: so an enemy can more easily
discrie our errors th^^ our friends, and therefore says Tully, it is good to
have enemies in the city. The husbandman grieueth that his (...) should have
a better crop of corn than himself, and therefore ^e rises more early than
otherwise he would, that (...) might be as fruitful as his ennemies: and we
think it again ^lami^^ to be (...) with any vice by them of all others, and
therefore we strain our selves to live more uprightly than otherwise we would
have done, if we had none to emulate. Scipio Affricanus was of no account in
Rome before Cyrus prowess and manhood was blazed in Italy, emulating whose
fortitude (as one angry with himself that his enemy should go beyond him) he
achieved that fame of wisdom and valor as few had attained before him: and
Themistocles was wont to say, that he could never sleep or take any rest,
because the victory which Miltiades got was always in his mind: and Caesar had
never aspired to so great renown, but by emulating the example of Alexander,
whose victories when he read, he presently burst forth into tears, for that
at the same age wherein Alexander lived himself, had done nothing worthy of
memory. Therefore as Alexanders renown was the cause of Caesar's travels, and
Miltiades victory the cause of Themistocles watching: so let our enemies
vigilancie be a spur to rouse us from negligencie and flatterers engines, to
make us more circumspect. Oceamademus had never been honored with so many
triumphs, if he had not always been beset with enemies, for it is said of
him, that when he had subdued al his enemies, he gave commandment that there
should not be above half of them put to the edge of the sword, the rest would
he place near the confines of his camp, which might keep his soldiers from
idleness and security, which caused him to have so many so expert and skillful
soldiers, that not twice he is reported to have ever been overcome.
Therefore we see it is better to live amongst our enemies whom we are sure do
hate us, then amongst flatterers whom we suppose to love us, for we are never
more near drowning then when we sail near the shore, nor never oftener
indamaged then when we think our selves without danger. Sampson lived safely
enough among his enemies the giantly Philistines, but in his wives lay where
he thought himself safest, he was quickly subdued: and Hercules was not so
much tormented by the dragons in Hesperidos, as by the shirt which Deianira had
sent him in token of her faithfulness. Many of Sampsons wives posterity are yet
living in the world, who are in shapes angels, but in qualities devils, that to
work their desires can turn themselves into as many subtilties and sugared
humilities, as the Camelion into colors, or the iuggler into strange devices
to deceive the beholders, that can present a man bread in one hand, and his
bane in the other, a fine shel and a rotten kernel, whose words are like
alminacks that decipher nothing but uncertainty, or like Pithias oracles which
speak one thing, and mean another: as Herod did to the wise man of the East,
who promised to worship Christ, when he purposed to murder him, for if they
had not by a vision been counseled to have turned another way, should have
found under the shape of a Lamb, the substance of a Lion, under flourishing
words dissembling deeds, and under most courteous countenance, most currish
conditions. Therefore to shut up al in a word, seeing the most glittering sands
are found so fickle being tried, the eye pleasing Echates so infectious being
handled, and the greatest promises to have so small performances, that we cannot
safely believe friend or foe, kinsman or aliant, by his word nor his oath, let
us try ere we trust, and prove ere we put in practice, let us go as the snaile
fair and softly, seeing haste makes waste, and the Malt is sweetest when the
fire is softest, so shall we the better discern the true sterling from the
counterfeit coin, the precious medicine, from the perilous confection, the
loyal lover from the fading flatterer, but then let us not sing Medeas song,
which said I see and allow the better, but I will follow the worse: seeing
Pallas gift or Iunoes proffer to be more profitable, let us not give our apple
to flattering Venus, as foolish Paris did lest she be our confusion, nor let us
setle our affections, on fair tongued parasites, lest like lightning they
break our bones, before we can perceive our skin to be hurt, but let us try
ere we trust, after good assurance, let us not trust before we try for fear
of repentance.
