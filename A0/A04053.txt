The^terlude of youth.


Jesus that his arms did sprede
And on a tree was done to dead
From all perils he you defend
I desire audyence till I have made an end
For am come from God above
To occupye his laws to your behoue
And am named Charytye
There may no man saved be
without the help of me
For he that Charytye does refuse
Other virtues thought he do use
^^e^out charity it will ^^t ^e
For it is written in the faith
Qui mane^ in charitate in deo monet
I am the gate I tell the
Of heaven that joyful city
There may no make thider come
But of charyty he must have some
Or ye may not come iwis
Unto heaven the city of bliss
Therefore charity who will him take
A pure soul it will him make
Before the face of God
In the.A.B.C. of books the least
yt is written deus charitas est
Lo charytie is a great thing
Of all virtues it is the king
When God in earth was here living
Of charyti he found none endinge
I was planted in his heart
We two might not depart
Out of his heart I did spring
Through the might of the heaven king
And all prestes that be
May singe no mass without charity
And chary to them they do not take
They may not receive him that did them make
And all this world of naught
youth. A back fellows and give me room
Or I shall make you to avoid sone
I am goodle of person
I am pereles where ever I come
My name is youth I tell the
I florysh as the vine tree
who may belikeneth unto me
In my youth and Iolytye
My heart is royal and bushed thick
My body plyaunt as a hasel styck
Mine arms be both fair and strong
My fingers be both fair and long
My chest big as a tun
My legs be full light for to run
To hoppe and dance and make merry
By the mass I recke not a chery
What so ever I do
I am the heir of my fathers land
And it is come into my hand
I care for no more

charity. Are you so disposed to do
To follow vice and set virtue go

youth. Ye sir even so
For now a days he is not set by
Without he be vnthryftye

charity. You had need to ask God mercy
Why do you so prase your body

youth. Why knave what is that to the
wylt thou let me to praise my body
why should I not praise it and it be goodli
I will not let for the

charity. What shall it be when thou shall flyt
For the wealth into the pyt
Therefore of it be not to boolde
Least thou forthink it when thou art old
ye may be lykened to a tree
In youth floryshyng with royalte
And in age it is cut down
And to the fire is thrown
So shall thou but thou amend
Be burned in hell without end

(...) (...)
Be ware least thou thither go
Hence caytyfe go thy way
Or with my dagger I shall the slay
Hens knave out of this place
Or I shall lay the on the face
Say thou that I shall go to hell
For ever more there to dwell
I had leuerthou had evil fare

charity A yet sir do by my read
And ask mercy for thy mysdede
And you shall be an herytoure of bliss
Where al joy and myrthe is
Where thou shall se a gloryus sight
Of au^geles singyng with saints bright
Before the face of God

youth. What syrs abowe the sky
I hah need of a ladder to climb so hie
But what and the ladder slyppe
Than I am deceived yet
And if I fall I catch a quecke
I may fortune to break my neck
And that ioynte is ill to set
Nay nay not so

charity O yet remember call to thy mind
The mercy of God passes al thing
For it is written by noble clerks
The mercy of God passes all works
That witnesses holy scripture saying thus
Miseratio domini super omnia opera eius
Therefore doubt not goods grace
There of is plenty in every place

youth. what me think ye be clerkyshe
For ye speak good gibbryshe
Sir I pray you and you have any store
Soil me a questyon or ye cast out any more
Least when your conning is all done
My question have no solucyon
Sir and it please you this
Why do men eat mustred with salfishe
Sir I pray you soil me this question
That I have put to your discrecyon

charity. This question is but vanity
yt longs not to me
Such questions to assoyle

youth Sir by god that me dear bought
I se your conning is littell or naught
And I should follow your scole
Sone ye would make a fool
Therefore crake no longer here
Least I take you on the ear
And make your head to ache

charity. Sir it falls not for me to fight
Nether by day ne be night
Therefore do my counsel I say
Than to heaven thou shall have thy way

youth. No sir I think ye will not fight
But to take a man's purs in the night
ye will not say nay
For such holy caitifes
Were wont to be thieves
And such would be hanged as hye
As a man may se with his eye
In faith this same is true

charity. God save every christen body
From such evil destenye
And send us of his grace
In heaven to have a place

youth. Nay nay I warrant the
He has no place for the
We nest thou he will have such fools
To sit on his gaie stools
Nay I warrant the nay

Humilitye. Well sir I put me in gods will
whether he will me save or spyll
And sir I pray you do so
And trust in god what so ever ye do

youth. Sir I pray the old thy peace
And talk to me of no goodness
And soon look thou go thy way
Lest with my dagger I the slaye
In faith if thou mean my heart
Thou shalt be wearye of thy part
Or thou and I have done

charity. Think what God suffered for the
His arms to be spread upon a tree
A knight with a spear opened his side
In his heart appeared a wound wide
That bought both you and me

youth. Gods fast what is that to me
Thou dawe will thou read me
In my youth to lose my ioylytie
Hence knave and go thy way
Or with my dagger I shall the slaye

charity. O sir hear what I you tell,
And be ruled after my counsel
That ye might sit in heaven hye
with God and his company

youth. A yet of God thou will not cease
Till I fight in good earneste
On my faith I tell the true
if I fight I tell the true
All the days of thy life

charity Sir I ^e wen none other wise or
I will go to my brother Humility
And take good counsel of him
How it is best to be do theryn

youth ye mary sire I pray you of that
Me think it were a good sight of your back
I would se your heles hither
And your brother and you together
Fettred fine fast
I wys and I had the kay

charity. Or I let you lose
Fare well my masters euerychone

youth. And tell you how I have done
And thou come hither again
I shall send the hens in ye devils name
What now, I may have my space
To ^et here in this place
Before I might not stere
when the churl charity was here
But now among al this chere
I would I had some company here

For to beat charity

He were better to bide still
And he give the crooked langage

And that thou shall se sone
How lightly it shall be done
And he will not be ruled with knockes

To heal his sore shinnes

youth. I shall help the if I can
To drive away that hang man
Herke Riot thou shall understand

Me think it were best therefore
That I had one man more

youth. yet syrs let this cease

But he labors all in vain.

Riot, Lo syrs look what I bring
Is not this a ioly ringinge
By my troth I trow it be
I will go with of charity
How say thou master charity
Does this gear please the.

charity. They please me well in deed
The more sorrow the more mede
For God said while he was man
Beatiqui persecutione^ patiu^tur propter iusticia^
Unto his apostles he said so
To teach them how they should do

Pride, we shall se how they can please
Sit down sir and take your ease
Me think these same were full meet
To go about your fair feet

youth. By my truth I you tell
They would become him very well
Therefore hye that they were on
Unto the tavern that we were gone

Riot, That shall ye se anon
How soon they shall be on
And after we will not tarry long
But go hence with a merry song

Pride, Let us begin all at once

youth. Now have at it by cocks bones
And soon let us goo

charity. Lo masters here you may see beforne
That the weed ouergroweth the corn,
Now may ye see all in this tide
How vice is taken, and virtue set aside
yonder ye may see youth is stable
But evermore chaungeable
And the nature of men is frail
That he wotteth not what may avail
Virtue for to make
O good Lord it is a pitiful case
Since God has lent man wit and grace
To chose of good and evil
That man should voluntarylye
To such things him self apply
That his soul should spyll

(...) Christ yt was crucified and crowned with thorn

(...) (...)
Forsake them and do after us
The better shall you do

Riot. Sire he shall do well inowe
Though he be ruled by neither of you
Therefore crake no longer here
Least you have on the ear
And that a good knock

Pride. Lyghtlye se thou avoid the place
Or I shall give the on the face
youth I trow that he would
Make you holy or ye be old
And I swear by the rode
It is time inoughe to be good
When that ye be old

youth. Sir by my truth I the say
I will make merry whiles I may
I can not tell you how long

Riot. ye sir so mote I thryue
Thou art not certain of thy life
Therefore thou were a stark fool
To leave myrthe and follow their scole

humili. Sir I shall him exhort
Unto us to resort
And you to forsake

Pride. Ask him if he will do so
To forsake us and follow you two
Nay I warrant you nay

humili. That shall you^ even anon
I will unto him gone
And se what he will ^aye

Riot. Hardely go on thy way
I know well he will say nay

youth. Ye sir ^e God that me ^ere ^^^ght
Me think ye labor all for naught
Benest thou that I will for the
Or thy brother Charytie
Forsake this good company
Nay I warrant the

Pride. ^o master I pray you of that
For any thing for sake us not
and all our counsel rule you by
ye may be Emperor or ye dye

youth. While I have life in my body
Shall I be ruled by Riot and the

Riot. Sir than shall ye do well
For we be true as stele
Sir can teach you to play at the dice
At the queen's game and at the Iryshe
The Treygobet and the hasarde also
And many other games mo
Also at the cards I can theche you to play
At the triump and one and thyrtye
Post, pinion and also aumsase
And at ad other they call dewsace
yet I can tell you more and ye shyll con me thank
Pinke and drink and also at the blanke
And many sportes mo

youth. I thank the Riot so mote I the
For the counsel thou haste given me
I will follow thy mind in every thing
And guide me after thy learning

charity. Youth leave that counsel for it is naught
And amend that thou have mys wrought
That thou may save that God has boughte

youth. What say ye master charity
whath has God bought
By my troth I know not
(...)
He came never at the stues
Nor in no place where I do use
I wis he bought not my cap
Nor yet my ioylie hat
I wot not what he has bought for me
And he bought any thing of mine
I will g^ue him a quarte of wine
The next time I him meet

charity. Sir this he did for the
When thou wast hand he made the free
And bought the with his blood

youth. Sir I pray you tell me
How may this be
That I know I was never bond
Unto none in England

charity. Sir I shall tell you
When Adam had done great trespass
And out of paradise exiled was
Then all the soles as I can you tell
were in the bondage of the devil of hell
Till the father of heaven of his great mercy
Sent the second person in Trinity
Us for to redeem
And so with his precious blood
He bought us on the roode
And our souls did save

youth. How should I save it tell me now
and I will be ruled after you my soul to sau^

Riot. What youth will you forsake me
I will not forsake thee

humili. I shall tell you shortly
Knele down and ask God mercy
For that you have offended

Pr^^^^ Youth will thou do so
Follow them and let us go
Marye I trow nay

youth. Here all sin I forsake
And to God I me betake
Good Lord I pray the have no indignacion
That I a sinner should ask salvation

charity. Now thou must forsake pride
And all Riot set aside

Pride. I will not him forsake
Neither early ne late
I wend he would not forsake me
But if it will none otherwise be
I will go my way

youth. Sir I pray God be your speed
and help your at your need

Riot. I am sure thou will not forsake me
Nor I will not forsake thee

youth. I forsake you also
and will not have with you to do

Riot. And I forsake the utterly
Fie on the caytife fie
Once a promise thou did me make
That thou would me never forsake
But now I se it is hard
For to trust the wretched world

humili. Fare well masters euerycheone
For your sin look ye morn
and evil creatures look ye turn
For your name who makes insicion
Say it is good contricion
That for sin does morn

charity. Here is a new array
For to walk by the way
Your prayer for to say

(...) Here be bedes for your devotion
And keep you from all temptacyon
Let not vice devour
When ye se mysdoing men
Good counsel give them
And teach them to amend

youth. For my sin I will morn
All creatures I will turn
and when I see misdoinge men
Good counsel I shall give them
and exorte them to to amend

charity. Then shall ye be an heritour of bliss
Where all joy and mirth is

youth. To the which eternal
Go bring the persons all
Here being amen.

humili. Thus have we brought our matter to an end
Before the persons here present
Would every man be content
Least onother day we be shente

charity. He thank all this present
Of their meek audyence

humili. Jesus that sytteth in heaven so hye
Men and women that here be
amen amen, for charity.
