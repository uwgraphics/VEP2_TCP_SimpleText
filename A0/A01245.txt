How four merchants met (...) which were of four diverse (...) ^de all to
Paris.
IN the year of our lord (...) happened that four^ (...) out of diverse
country^^ (...) as they were goyn^ (...) ^^^^une they met all together and (...)
^^gyder / for they were all four going (...) in France and for company sake
they rode (...) unto one ynne / and it was about shraftyde in the most joyful
time of all the year and their names were called as here follows. ye first was
called Courant of Spain / ye second was called Borchart of France / the
third was called Johan of Florence / and the fourth was called Ambrose of
Iennen. Than by the consent of the other merchants Borcharde of france went
unto the host and said. Host now is the meryest time of the year and we be
four merchants of four diverse cou^tryes and by fortune we met all together
in one place and out journey is to Paris. And therefore while we be so met let
us make good there together / and ordeyne ye best meet yt ye can get for money
against to morrow and bid also some of your best frindes that you love most
that we may make good there together or that we deparse fro hense / and we
shall co^tente you all your money again. And than the host said that he
would do it with a good will and than went he and bad many of his good friends
and neighbors to dinner and he bought of ye best meet that he could get for
money and brought it home. And on the morrow he dressed it and made it ready
against dinner after the best manner yt he could. And when yt it was dinner (...)
gestes to dinner and the merchants (...) them welcome. Than bad ye mar^^^^^^
(...) ^^at he should bring in the meet and (...) might go to dinner. And than
the (...) ^yll. Than went the host and (...) meet and set it thereon and pray^
(...) ^estes to them and sit dow^ (...) good chere al ye day long with good
honeste^ (...) ^as very late with daunsynge and lepynge. And (...) ^ad done /
the gestes took their leave of the marcha^^^^^ and thanked them for their good
chere. And than every man departed home to his house. And than came the
merchants to the host and prayed him hertely for to come in and thanked him
that he had ordered and done all things so well and manerly.



How two of the merchants / as Johan (...) and Ambrosius of Iennen hyld one
another, v. thou^^^^ gold guldens.
When al ye merchants and the gestes had m^^^^ ^^^rye together all the day
long / at night t^^^ (...) took their leave of ye merchants / and thanked
them for (...) good chere that they had made them / and so departed every one
to their lodging. And when that they were departed every man to their house /
tha^ wexed it late. And tha^ came the host of ye house to the merchants and
asked them if that they would go sleep / and they answered unto their host
yes. And than took he a candel and brought ye merchants into a fair chamber
/ where was. iiij. beds rychely hanged with costely curtaynes that every
merchant might lie by themself. And when that they were all together in ye
chamber / than began they to speak of many things / some good / some bad as it
lay in their minds. Than said Courant of spain. Syrs we have be all this
day merry and made good chere and every one of us has a fair wife at home:
how fare they now at home we can not tell. Tha^ said bourcharde of France to
the other merchants. What ask you how they do^ They sit by the fyere and
make good chere and eat / and drink of the best and labor not at all / and
so get they unto them hot blood and than they may take an other lusty young
man and do their pleasure with him yt we know not of / for we be oftentimes
long from them and for yt cause may ye lenne a lofe for a need secretly to an
other. Than said Johan of Florence / we may all well be called fools and
nydeates that trust our wyfes in this manner as we do: for a womans heart is not
made of so hard a stone but yt (...) will melte / for a woman's nature is to be
unsteadfast and tourneth as the wind does and cares not for us till the time
yt we come again. And we labor daily both in wind and rain and put often
our lives in to pardy and in adventure on the sea for to find them wtall and ou^
wyfes sit at home and make good chere with other good fellows and give them part
of the money that we get. And therefore an ye will do after my counsel / let
every one of us take a fair wenche to pass ye time wtal as well as our wyfes
do / and they shall know no more of that / than we know of them. Than said
Ambrosius of Ienne^ to them. By gods grace that shall I never do while yt I
live. For I have at home a good and a virtuous woman and a womanlye. And I
know^ (...) she is not of that dysposycyo^ / but yt she will eschew (...) of
all such ill abusyons till the time that I com home again. For I know well
that she will have non other man but me alone. And if that I should break my
wedlock than were I but little worth. Than said John of Florence. Fellow ye
set much price by your wife at home and trust her with all that ye have I
will lay with you a wager of. v. thousand guldens if yt ye will abide me here
I shall depart and ride to Iennen and do with your wife my will. Than said
Ambrosius to Johan of Florense. I have delivered to my host. v. thousand
guldens to keep / put ye down as much against it and I shall tarry here till
the time that ye return again from Ie^nen / and if that you by any manner of
menes can get your pleasure of my wife ye shall have all this money. Than said
Johan of Florence. I am content / and than putted he in his hosts hand other.
v. thousand guldens against Ambroses money. And than took he(...)
