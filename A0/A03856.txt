The inquiry and verdite of the quest panneld of the death of Richard Hune
which was found hanged in Lolars tower.

To the Reader.
TO see (most dear Reader) how suttellie the truth is ever persequuted might
seame great wonder / but that the holy gooste has often times showed and
testified in the Scripture that hit should so be. What kind of persequucion has
been unproven? what can be imagined that has not hitherto been practisede
concerning soche things? In some places they heed and afterward burn / in
some places they bring straighte wayse to the fire. When that shift will not
serve / or yt they dare not hurt the person living by cause of his riches or
power etc. yet will they burn him after he died peasablie in his bed / as they
did Wicleffe and Tracie with other / to keep the simple innocent sowles which
they have made blind still to continewe in darkness / sayyng / he was an
heretic who so ever keep his opinions shall be burned living / and so the
burning of that which fealte no pain is a great fear to the ignorant that
seith hit.

Some be cause they be wise and utter the hypocrisye and abominable living of
whorehunters with discrete communicacion / so that no man can gain say or
accuse them but they say trweth be brought in to presone and heresies fained
out of hand that be sparppled abroad to the people with all the appearance of
verity that can be divised to persuade them that the parties be not presoned
undeserved / which if they will not confess and promise to be openly abiured to
their great shame their necks be broken or else they be some other wise
conueyde / and after hanged up / and than said and preached to that they
hanged them sealues / as was this Hune / which to be true thou shall easelie
perceive by the inquiry and verdite of the queest here in this litell treatise
contained. if they be poor and want friends and no evident cause found
wherefore they should suffer / then die they in presone no man knowith how / hit
is straight waise said if any man axe of them that they died of one disease or
other and no mooe words ar made. if a man knowing their malicyouse hertes
get him further from danger in to some other realm / which happily is to
circumspect to be taken by any commune officer or known enemy / straighte
way cause they one or other for money to play Judas part and to make him sealf
great with the party / and as thowghe he favored him singularly to make
much on him till he see his time and than betray him / as they have even now
played with William Tyndal a man of synguler vertuousnes and of no less
lernyng and judgment in scripture and of a rare gentillnes of co^dicions as all
they can testyfie that knew him and used familiarity with him. Summa to keep
up the Kingdom of fornicatours and aduowtrers that they may live in all
pleasure and ydelnes / seruyng their belies only and living more viciouslie
than ever did the hethen / and for the enstablishement thereof to thrust down
virtuous living and true preaching has no sotteltie been unsought for / nor
none shall be I fear me of their parties / until they be yet brought lower / I
speak of the bad / for the good as they have in every place for the most
part to litell so can they not have to much. Thus seist thou their practice
before this time used how they have with all sottelltie persequuted them that
of good zeal and love have frelie spoken the truth / and how they have hyd
and clocked that they did with the appearance of holiness / as thowghe they had
done hit to extinct heresies / for so made they the people to believe. Other
fruits have they hither to not brought forth. So long space violently to have
subdued gods holy word weere as me semyth to much and the time now
counuenient with have to reform them sealues and to prepare their hearts
louynglye to receive the word of their sowles health and wyllynglie to
distribute hit to the simple and ignoraunte people / every man according to
his gift / yet se I not that they be any thing wyllyng thereunto but rather in
mind to rage moare then they did before.

The light is now broken forth (thanks be to the Lord) mager their beardes /
and they brought in no small fear of sudden ruin of their kingdom / yet by
cause they se the world has not fully forsaken their deceyuable doctrine in
all places / they hope of a change / and have their secret conspirisies
devised with all sutteltie to bring that to pas / the good they do they do by
compulsion and for fear of losyng their possessions / hitherto is there no
sign of repentance taken in heart for their abhominacions so long used.
Still live they as they did before / they are no les desirouse of promocion / no
les delited in belly Joy / in wealfaring / in gorgiouse raiment / as ready to
abhor chaste matrimonye and daily to commit whordome and aduoutrie / as loathe
to do the business which they are only bound to as ever they weere / I mean to
preach with synceritie gods wholly word and that for love and zeal that
they have to se christen living florisshe and not for the fylthie lukres sake.
They stand but at a stay till they may find by one mean is or other away to
bring in their old accostomed vices to be counted holiness / as they in times
past have made the world to believe. They do but disseamble in vtwarde
apperaunce / in heart they be infect with their accostomed traterie / ever ready
when occasion shall be given to play their parts a thousand times moare
tyranniouslie than ever they did. So leave they their old furiouse heyte of
ma^kquelling that nevertheless they still intend yet ones a gain to raise hit
up. what hertes have these men? what token of meaknes and sofferaunce is yet
espied in them: what sign of return from their unspeakable malice? which
springs of no another thing than of avarice and desire to live voluptuouslie.
Those yt be good note I not but ye evil nether hate I or would any man should
hate the persons of them but the vices / which I would gladly were amended not
increased. If we touch them never so littell then hear we that we rail on
them / blaspheme them / belie them and speak uncharitably by them* to which
thing I thus answer / if they would indifferently search what is said and
apply hit to the reule of haritie they should find no thing spoken but truth /
no thing so sharply touched as is of their part deserved. Leat every man
which fyndeth him sealf any thing grieved descend in to iugment of his own
conscience and axe what hit says / which if they would often do they should sone
find all that is spoken to be les than the truth / seem hit at the first
never so sharp or rigourose. Nether is every sharp word uncharitable / except
S. John baptist were not well auised when he called the Pharizees and Saducees
the generation of vipers Mat. iij. or our savior Christ out of charity
vsyng the sealf words. Math. xij. And again sayyng to them woo be to you
Scribes pharizees hipocrites. Mat. xxiij. Luce. xi. and in ye viij. of John
calls he them the sons of the devil. Saint Paul also to one Elimas a
socerer was not a ferde to say. O full of sotteltie and deceytfulnes the child
of the devil and the enemy of al rightwisnes thou ceasist not to pervert the
straightwai se of the lord. Acto. xiij. Men may not live as blind as betelles
/ as ignorant as asses / as sottell as foxis / as lecherouse as gootes / moare
beastly than beasts / and look still that God will suffer them either to be
unspoken of or vnpunnysshed / but rather should think that their offenses be
(as the truth is) so hanouse that no tongue can express them no hand endite
them no wit comprehend them and sorrow and repent them and continually pray to
their most merciful father to give them some sparkell of grace wherbie the
may amend them.

Leat falshed give place to the truth. Leat viciouse living be hated / and
virtue had in price. Leat rancor be turned in to love unfeigned. Leat the learned
bear with the ignorant so far as may be suffered / and the ignorant be
obsequiouse to hear the learned: ye leat the learned rather study one to be
comfortable to a another / and one charitablie and indifferently hear a another
/ and dispute with patience not with braunlyng and a gree lovingly with out
scholdyng / every man knowing that he may err and excludyng sealff will and
sinistre judgment and than no doubt but all sharp monicio^s shall cease and in
their stead succeed praise to the eternal God / in whose power hit only
lies this thing to perform and a mongest men great love and concord / and
also thanks geuyng for his inestimable goodness / to whom be all honor and
praise for ever. Amen.

Of their diverse and manyfold facions this be sufficient at this time / now
harken to the inquiry and sentens given concerning the death of the afforsaide
Richard Hune.

Read Reader and judge.

THe.v. and the.vj. day of Dece^ber / in the.vi. year of ye reygne of our
suffrayne Lord King Henry the.viij. Wylliam Barnwel / Crowner of London / the
day and year above said / with in the ward of Castilbaynerde of London
Assembled in a quest whose names afterward do appear / and has sworn them
treuly to enquere of the death of one Richard hune / which lately was fownde
deed in the lolars tower / with in paul's church of London wheruppon all we of
ye inqueste to geather went up in to the said tower / where we fownd the body
of ye said hune hangyng upon a staple of Iron / in a gyrdel of sylcke / with
fair countinaunce / his heed fair kemmyd / and his bonnet right syttyng a pon
his heed / with his eyne and mouth fair closed / with out any staryng /
gapyng / or frowning. Also with out any dreueling or spurgyng in any place of
his body. Where upon by one assent all we agreede / to take down the body of
the said hune / and as soon as we began to heue ye body hit was loose /
wherbie by good aduisement we perceived that the gyrdel had no knot a boue the
scaple / but hit was double cast / and lynckes of an Iron chain which did hang
on the same staple were leyde upon ye same gyrdell whereby he did hang. Also ye
knot of the gyrdel that went about his neck stood under his left ear / which
caused his heed to leyne toward his right shoulder. Natwithstandyng there came
out of his nose turles.ij. small streams of blood to the quantity of.iiij.
drops Save only these.iiij. drops of blood / the face / lips / chynne /
doublet / collar and shurte of the said Hune was clean from any blood Also
we find that the skyn both of his neck / and throat by nethe the gyrdel of
sylcke / was freat and fased away / with that thing which the murtherars had
broken his neck withal. Also the hands of ye said Hune were wrong in the
wrystes: werby we perceived yt his hands hade been bound.

More over we find that with in the said prisonne was no mean whereby any man
might hang him sealfe but only a stole / which stole stood a pon a bolster of
a bed / so ^yckel that any man or be might not touch hit so litell but hit
was ready to fall. Whereby we perceived that hit was not possible that Hune
might hang him sealfe the stole so standing. Also all the gyrdell from the
staple to his neck / as well as the part which went about his neck was to
little for his heed to cum out there at. Also hit was not possible that yt soft
silken gyrdel should break his neck or skin benethe ye gyrdel. Also we find
in a corner / some what be younde the place where he did hang a great percel
of blood. Also we find that upon the leafte side of hunnes Iacket from the
breaste dounwarde be great streams of blood. Also with in the flappe of the
le^te side of his Iacket / we find a great clouster of blood / and the
Iacket foolden down theruppon / which thing the said Hun could never foold nor
do after he was hanged. Wherbie hit aperitith playnlie to us all that the neck
of hune was broken / and the great plenty of blood was shede before he was
hanged. Wherefore all we find by God and all our consciences / that Richard
hune was murdered / also we aquite the said richard hune of his own deeth

Also an end of a wax candel which as John Bellynger says he left in the
presone burning with hune that same sondaie at night that Hune was murdered
which wax candel we found stickyng upon the stockkes fair put out / about
vij. or viij. foot from the place where hune was hangede / which candel after
our opinion was never put out by him / for many likelihoodes which we have
perceived. Also at ye going up of master Chau^celer in to lolars tower we have
good proof that there lay on the stockkes a gown either of murrey or crymson
in grain furred with sha^kes / whose gown hit was we could never prove /
nether who bare hit way. All we find yt M. William horsey chau^celer to my
lord of london has had at his commandment both ye rule and gyding of the
said prisonner / by all the time of his impresonement. Moreover all we find
yt ye said master Horsey Chaunceler has put out charles Joseph of his office
/ as the said charlis has confessed by cause he would not deal and use the
said prisonner so cruelly / and do to him as ye Chaunceler would have had him
to do. Notwithstonding ye keyys deliverance to the Chaunceler by charlis on
the satyrday at night before hunnes deeth / such co^ue^tion^ make they man to
blind ye sy^pel
and charles ryding out of the town on the sunday in the morning ensuyng was
but a conuencion made be twyxt Charlis and the Chaunceler / for to color the
murder / for the same sunday that Charles rode forth he came again to town
the same sunday night and killed richard hune / as in the deposicions of
Julian Lyttel / Thomas Chytcheley / Thomas Symondes / and Peter Torner does
appear

After coloring of the murder be twyxt charles and the Chaunceler conspired /
the Chaunceler called to him one John spaldyng bellrynger of Paul's / and
delivered to ye same bellrynger ye keyys of ye lowlars tower geuyng to the
said belrynger a great charge / saing I charge ye to keep Hun more straytelie
than he has been kept / and let him have but one meal a day. Moreover I
charge ye leat no body come to him without my license / nether bring shurte /
kappe / kercheffe / or any other thing / but yt I see hit before hit come to
him Also before Hune was carried to fulham the Chaunceler commanded to be put
upon hunnys neck a great collar of Iron with a great chain which is to heavy
for any be to were and long to endure.

More over hit is well proved yt before Hunnes deeth the said Chau^celer came
up in to ye said lolars tower and knelyd down before Hun / holdyng up his
hands to him / prayyng him of forgyuenes of all that he has done to him and
must do to him. And on the sunday following the Chaunceler commanded the
penete^sarie of Paul's / to go up to him and say him a Gospel / and make for
him holy bred and holy water / and give hit to him which so did / and after
the Chaunceler commanded that hune should have his dynner / And the same dynner
time Charlis boy was shut in presonne with Hun / wiche was never so before /
and after dynner when the belrynger fet out the boy / the belrynger said to
the same boy / come no moare hither with meat for him until to morrow at
noone / for master Chaunceler has commanded that he shall have but one meal
day and the same night following Richard hune was murdered / which murder
conde not have been done with out consent and licens of the Chaunceler / and
also by the wyttyng and knowledge of John spaldyng belrynger / for there conde
no man come in to the presone but by the keyys / being in John bellryngers
keapyng. No he ^hought (...) he shu^d neu ea^e moare for he had prepared his
dynner against the mon^aye
Also as by my Lord of Londons book does appear John bellrynger is a poor
innocent man / wherefore all we do perceue that this murder conde not be done
but by the commandment of the Chaunceler / and by the wyttyng and knowing of
John belrynger

Charles Joseph with in the tower of London / of his own frewyl and
vnconstreyned said / ye master Chaunceler devised / and wrote wi^h his own
hand / all such herisies as were laid to hunnes charge Reacord / John god /
John truye / John pasmar / Richard Gybson with many other

Also charles Joseph says that when Richard hune was slain / John belrynger
bare up the steyre in to the lolars tower awar candell / having the keyys of
the doors ha^gyng on his arm / and I charles went next to him / and master
Chaunceler came up last / and when all we came up / we found hune lyeng on his
bed / and then master Chaunceler said lay hands on the theffe / and so al we
iij. murdered hune / and then I charles put ye gyrdell about Hunnes neck /
and then John bellrynger and I Charles did heue up Hune and master Chaunceler
pulled the gyrdel over the staple and so Hune was hanged

The deposicion of Julian lyttel late servant to Charles Joseph / by her frewyl
on constrained the xiiij. day of February / in the vi. year of our sovereign
lord King Henry the viij within the chapel of our lady of Bedlem showed to
thynquest
First Julian says yt the wennesdaye of night after the deeth of Richard hune
that Charles Joseph her master came home in to his house at x. of the clock in
the night / and set him down to his supper / then Julian said to him / master
hit was told me that ye were in presone / Charles answered / hit is mearie to
turn the penie / and after spuper / Charles trussed percell of his goods /
and with help of Julian bare them in to mastres portars house to keep / and
that done Charles said to Julian. Julian if thou will be sworn to keep my
council / I will show the my mind Iulia^ answered ye / if hit be nether
felony nor treason / then Charles took a book out of his pursse / and Julian
swear to him theruppon / then said Charles to Julian. I have distroyed Richard
Hune. Alas master said Iulia^ how / he was called a honest man / Charles
answered I put a wyre in his nose / Alas said Julian now be you cast away and
undone / than said Charles / Julian I trust in the that thou will keape my
council / and Julian answered ye / but for gooddes sake master shyft for your
sealffe / and than Charles said / I had lever tha^ a C. lib. it were not done
/ but that is done can not be undone / Moreover Charles said than to Julian /
upon sunday when I rode to my cosynne to baryngtons house / I tarried there
and made good chere all day till hit was night / and yet before hit was
mydnyght I was in London / and had killed Hune / and upon the next day I rode
thither again and was there at dynner / and sent for neyghburs and made good
chere / than Julian axed Charles / where set you your horse that night ye
came to town / and wherefore came you not whom / Charles answered / I came not
whom for fear of bewrayyng / and than Julian axed Charles / who was with you
at ye kyllyng of Hune / Charles answered I will not tell the / and Julian says
that upon the thursdaye following Charles tarried all day in his house with
great fear / and appon fridaye following yerlie in ye morning before day
Charles went forth (as he said) he went to paul's and at his coming in again
he was in great fear / saying hastily geat me my horse / and with great
fear and have made him ready to ride / and bad mastres portars lad lead his
horse in to ye fyld by the back side / and than charles put in to his sleue
his mase or masor with other plate / and borrowed of mastres portar both gold
and silver but how much I am not sure / and Charles went in to the feld after
his horse and I brought his boget after him. Also upon fridaye in christe^n
as weke following Charles came whom late in the night / and brought with him
iij. bakars and a smyth of streat ford / and the same ^ight they carried out of
Charles house all his goo^es by the fylde side to the bell at shordiche / and
yer^y on the morrow conueyyd hit with carts to streat forde

Moreover Julian says that ye saturdaye at night before the death of Hune
Charles came whom / and brought with him a Gurnard sayyng hit was for Hune and
charles boy telled to Julian that there was also ordened for Hune a piece of
freassh salmone which John bellynger had

Also Charles said to the said Julian / war not this an ungracious trouble /
I conde bring my lord of London to the doors of heritiques in London booth of
men and women that been worth M. lib. But I am ferd that ye ungracious
mydwyfe shallbe wraye us all

Also charles said unto mastres porter in like wise / and more larger sayyng
of the best in London / whereto mastres porter answered / ye best in London is
my lord maire / than Charles said / I will not skyll him quite / for he takes
this matter whotte

Where as Charles joseph says he lay at neck hill with a harlot a man's wife
in baryngtons house the same night / and there abode until the morrow at.xi. of
ye clock that Richard hune was morthered / where upon he brought before the
kings council for his purgacion yt forsaide baude baringtonnes wise / and
also thafforsaide Harlot / which purgation we have proved all untrue as right
larglie may appear as well by the deposicyon of Iulia^ littell / as of thomas
chitcheley tailor / and of John^ symons stacioner / with other / as of Robert
johnson and Peter torner

The deposicio^ of Thomas chitcheley tailor
The said Thomas says / the same monday yt richard hune was found deed with in
a quarter of an hour after vij a clock in the morning / he met with Charles
joseph coming out of Paul's at the nether north door / going toward pater

He says the same morning that Hune was found deed / that within a quarter of
an hour after vij. a clock in the morning Charles Joseph came before him at
his stalle / and said good morrow gossep Simons / and the same Symons said
good morrow to him again / and ye wiffe of the same Simons was by him / and be
cause of the deedly countenance and hasty going of Charles the said Thomas
bad his wiffe look whither Charles gooyth / and as she conde perceive Charles

The deposicion of Robert johnson and his wiffe dwelling at the bell in
shordiche / where Charles joseph set his horse that night yt he came to town
to murder Richard Hune.
The said Robert says that Charles joseph sent his horse to his house a pon
a holiedaye at night about.iij wekes before christe^mas by a boy / which
horse was albe sweet / and albe myred: and the said boy said / laet my
fathers horse stond sadelled / for I cannot tell whether my father will ride
again to night or not / and the said horse stood saddelled all night / and
in the morning following Charles came booted and sporred about.viij. of the
clock / and axed if his horse was sadelled / and the servant answered ye /
and the said Charles leapt upon his horse / and prayed the host to let him
out at his back gate / that he might ride out by the fyld side / which host
so did / and by cause he was uncertain of the day / we asked him if he had
herd speak of ye death of Hune at and time or not / and he answered nay: but
shortly after he did. Nevertheless Peter torner Charles son in law which
brought the horse by night in to the bell Robert iohnsons house / confessed
hit was ye same night before that Hune was found deed in the morning

Moreover the frydaie before Hunes death Peter torner said to an honest wooma^
a waxchaundelers wife dwelling before saint Mary's spittel gate / that before
this day seven night Hune should have a mischeuouse deeth. And the same day at
after none that Hune was found deed the said Peter came to the same wife and
told her that Hune was hanged / sayng what told I you

Also James the Chauncelers koke the friday before Hunes death said to v.
honest men that Hune should die or christmas / or else he would die for him and
on the monday that Hune was found deed the said James came to the same women
/ and said / what toolde I you / is he not now hanged.

The words yt my lord of London spoke before the lords in the parliament
chaumber.
Memorandu^ yt the busshop of London said in the parlame^t chaumber yt there
was a byll brought to ye parlame^t to make ye jury that was charged upon ye
deeth of Hune trewmen / and said and took a pon his conscience yt they were
falsse perjured caytiffes / and said furthermore to all ye lords there then
being. For ye love of god look upon this matter / for if ye do not I dare not
keep mine own house for heretics / and said that the said Richard Hune
hanged him sealffe / and ye hit was his own deed / and no man's else. Hit
(...) won (...) yt he took there not bo^th man (...) wiffe (...) is not (...)
manne^ of busshoppes to leat such es^ kaepe (...) it is to be thought tha^ he
said not truth in a much as he pre^soned ^em no
And furthermore said that there came a man to his house (whose wiffe was
apeched of heresy) to speak with him / and he said yt he had no mind to speak
with the same man / which man spoke and reported to ye servants of ye same
busshoppe that if his wife woold not hold still her opinion / he woold cut
her throat with his own hands / with other words moare.
