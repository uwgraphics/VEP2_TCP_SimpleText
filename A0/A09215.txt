Matheu vritis in his last chaiptur that all the power in heuine and in eird is

the virgin Maria (without ^ony corruptione of her virginite in any manner) to
clenge mine and al sinful mennis birth after the will of ye fader I trow that he
hesz suffert al his pain for me and al sinful mannis saik and that their with
he hes blissit al thayme quhilk suffers for his saik and yat all that they
suffer is for their saluatione I trow yat he deit and vesz eirdit to sia mine
and al mannis sinnis that trowis in hyme and ar grawit with hyme fra sine as S.
Paul sais in de vi c. to ye Romans / I trow that he hes slane the deid / and

The third part of faith
I Trou in ye halie spreit / and yat their is ane halie chrissine kirk quhilk

our lord Jesus Christis word and his halie sacrament And he is alanerlie ye
heid of this halie chrissine kirk and na mortal sinful man quhedir he be pape
or patriarch or any oder as money ignorant prechours hes prechit before / Sanct
Paul sais in ye first chaiptur to ye Ephesians / God hes giffine Jesus Christ
to be ane heid to al men quhilk ar his members and ce. I trow yat neyne cane be

Heir after folouis the pater noster vith ane schort declaratione apone the same
THe disciplis desirit at our lord Jesus Christ to leir thaime to pray (as
Ihone did his disciplis) as S. Luc writis in his xi chaiptur in the quhilk ca.
he techit thayme quhat they should pray and quhow they should persiueir and be
constant in prayer / alsua he techit thayme quhow they should pray and quhat they
should pray quhen he prechit the sueit sermond to thayme apone the montane (as S.
Matthew vritis in his vi chaiptur) say and quhen e pray e sal notht haiff money
vordis as ye paganis dwis for they trow to be hard for their money vordis
quhairfor e sal notht dw as they dw forour fader in the heuine knawis quhat e
mister or e desir any thing of hyme quhairfor e sal pray swa Our fader thou
quhilk is in ye heuine / thy nayme mot be hallowit / thy kingdom mot cum (to
vsz) thy will mot be dwne in ye eird as it is in the heuine giff wsz this day
our daily breid / and forgiff wsz our dettis as we forgiff our dettours / and
leid vsz notht in temptatione bot deliver vsz fra ewil Amen / Heir off our
Jesus Christis aune vordis ve leir quhow and quhat ve sal pray / the quhilk ii
thingis ar neidful to wsz to know

Quhou ve should pray
WE sal noth haiff money vordis bot we should haiff our heart and thocht apone that
quhilk we pray / ye fewer vordis ve haif ye prayer is ye better / and ye may
vordis ve haiff without ye heart thairapone ye prayer is ye var / few vordis
vith ane ardent desir of ye heart is ane crissine prayer money vordis vith ye
mwtht vithout ye heart is ane paganis prayier / quhairfor our lord said e sal
notht haiff money vordis quhen e pray as ye paganis dwis / he said alsua to ye
samaritane as sanct Ihone vritis in his iiii chaiptur voman trow me the our is
cum / quhen they quhilk prayis faithfully to the fader sal pray to hime in the
spreit and in verite / to pray in ye spreit yat is said aganis thayme quhilk
prays wtuertlie with ye mutht and notht ye heart / to pray in verite yat is said
aganis ye prayer quhilk is lik to ane schaudou quhilk aperis wtuertlie in ye
air as it var ane oder thing in verite / sua quhen men mwuis the mwtht and the
lippis and the tunge wtuertlie without ye heart and mind their apone / this
prayer aperis vtuertlie be for me^ bot it is notht in verite quhait for it may
be comparit to ane schadow / god said of thayme that prayis to hyme sua / as
the propheit Esaias vritis in his xxix chaip / this pepil virschipis me with
their lippis bot their heart is far fra me / bot the spiritual and very prayer
is vith the inwert desir and mwrning of the heart to God for his help / our
saluiour sais of thayme yat prayis sua / as S. Matthew vritis in his v chaiptur
/ Blissit ar they quhilk murnis for they sal be confortit ye wtuert prayer with
ye mutht (without the heart) be for men is na vorth be for god / bot it makis
falsz wtuert halines and hipocritis and causis thaime to trow yat they haiff
prayit veil quhe^ they haiff bablit lange with the lippis / bot the spiritual
and very prayer makis men godly and frwitful be for God / That is notht
possibil that he cane haiff money vordis that prayis spiritualie with the heart
for quhen he ramembers they wordis with the quhilk he prayis and quhat they
meyn / sua he man leiff the wordis and think quhat yai meyn / or else he man
leiff the mening and think apone the vordis thairfor man nedis notht to reid
and pray vtuertlie with the mutht bot giff that be inuertlie vith the heart and
ane fervent desir swa that the mind follow with the vordis and the menynge their
of / their is money psalmis in the psalter of lowine and thankkis to god and to
pray vith / nevertheless they haiff few vordis in thayme they raisz up the heart
to think and pray and to desir guide of god / part of psalmis ar sewert be this
vord sela that singnifeis rest and piece and this vord is noder red na sung in
any place / bot it singnifeis yat their is ane singlar marklie thing in yat
prayer and that man sal rest their and ramember apone the meninge and lat the
vordis alene salange

Quhat should ve pray
THe wordis should be they quhilk our lord Jesus Christ lerit wsz / our fader
thou quhilk is in the heuine and ce. Sane our lord hime selff maid this prayer
thairfor without any dout it is ye best and may acceptabil to our heavenly
fader for haid our master Jesus Christ knawine any oder prayer mair profetabil
for wsz and mair plesand to his fader / in verite he haid lerit wsz that /
nevertheless na man sal onderstand sua that oder prayers ar ewil or
oneprofetabil quhilk hes noth ye Pater noster in thayme / for money prophetis
and halie men prayit money prayers before that our lord vesz borne and
neuerthelis they var hard with God / bot al oder prayer awalis noth quhilk hes
noth ye same meninge Psalmis ar guide prayers bot they schaw notht sa cleirlie
this prayers meninge as it dwis it selff suppos they haiff that same meninge in
money placis / thairfor it is ane greit folly that any oder prayer should be
co^parit to the Pater Noster or to say or leir oders that their lisz mair
pardone to any oder prayer / as the papis hes dwne giffand sa money thousand
edris to reid ye dremis of me^ and they quhilk redis thayme may deliver sa money
saulis of purgatory / and they sal noth be condannit / ye quhilk is al bot
manifest leinge and haldis ye pepil in error I held mekil alsua before of
siclik praers and pardonis in my blindness quhair in i vesz before quhen i vesz
blindit with ye deuilis doctrine quhilk is ye doctrine of men / quhilk spekis

papis prayers hes beyne haldine mair precious na our lord Jesus Christis prayer
for causz they haiff giffine sic leinge and pardone to thayme ye quhilk hesz
blindit ye pepil and causit thayme to trow mair in the prayers dremit be men
(quhilk ar lears) na in ye prayer maid be our lord Jesus Christ quhilk is ye
euerlestand verite / Money prayis ye psalter of our lady part vith queral bedis
for causz they should their for haiff greit pardone / and oders prais this
Psalter / and makis their of ane fraternite / ye falsz prechours said to ye
simpil pepil yat they vane ye greit pardone for this suposz they prayit this
notht with ye heart bot yat is manifest leinge / siclik as ye oder thingis yat
they said thairof yat yair should be say money thousand eris of pardone for ye
prainge of thayme / siclik prayers ar mair skaithful na profetabil to ye
saluatione of the saul for causz our lord Jesus Christis prayer is thairfor
lichtlit / all that is neidful to the saul and liff of man is habundantlie
contenit in the Pater Noster for all the pardone and blissinge and al oder thing
quhilk is necessar for liff and saul both in this vardil and in the vardil to
cum is contenit in the Pater noster / and it is better to pray ane Pater Noster
with ane fervent mind their apone na to pray all the oder prayers maid be men
with their greit pardone AMEN
