TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, SIMON WORTEDG of Okenberrie in the County of
Huntington, Esquire: health, happiness, and prosperity.
THE general report and consideration (right Worshipful) of your exceeding
courtesy, and the great friendship which my parents have heretofore found at
the hands of your renowned Father do imbolden me to present unto your Worship
these my unpolished Labors; which if you shall vouchsafe to cast a favorable
glaunce upon, and therein find any part or parcel pleasing to your virtuous
mind, I shall esteem my travel most highly honored. The History (I present)
you shall find delightful, the matter not offensive to any: only my skill in
penning it very simply, and my presumption great, in presenting so rude a piece
of work to so wise a Patron; which I hope your Worship will the more bear
with, and account the rather to be pardonable, in that the fault proceeds
from a good meaning.

Your worships devoted, and poor Countryman. R. I.

The Pleasant History of TOM A LINCOLN, the RED-ROSE Knight: for his valor
and Chivalry, surnamed the Boast of England.
CHAPTER. 1. How King Arthur loved fair Angellica the Earl of Londons
Daughter: and likewise of the birth of Tom a Lincoln.
WHEN as King ARTHVR wore the Imperial Diadem of England, and by his chivalry
had purchased many famous Uictories, to the great renown of this maiden Land,
he ordained the order of the round Table, and selected many worthy Knights to
attend his Majesty: of whose glistering renown many ancient Histories do
record, and witness to all ensuing ages.

This worthy Prince, upon a time intending to visit the city of London, with
some few number of his Knights, came and feasted with Androgius, being at that
time Earl of London; whose house (as then) was not only replenished with most
delicate fare, but grat^st with a number of beautiful Ladies: who gave such a
pleasing entertainment to King Arthur and his Knights, that they were ravished
with pleasure, and quite forgot the sound of martial Drums, that had wont to
summon them forth to the fields of Honor: Amongst these glorious troops of
London Ladies, Angellica the Earls daughter had the chiefest praise for beauty
and courtly behavior: for even as the siluer-shining Moon in a Winters fr^sty
night, surpasses the brightest of the twinkling Stars: ^o far Angellicaes
sweet feature exceeded the rest of the Ladies: whereby King Arthur was so
entangled in the snares of love, that by no means he could withdraw his
affections from her divine excellence. He that before delighted to tread a
weary m^rch after Bellonas Drums, was now constrained to trace Cupids
Measures in Ladies Chambers: and could as well strain the strings of a Lovers
Lute, as sound a Soldiers alarm in the field: her beauty like the Adamant,
drew his steeled heart to lodge in the closure of her breast: and no company
delighted so much the loue-sicke King, as the presence of fair Angellica. So
upon a time as he stood looking out of his Chamber window, he espied the
Mistress of his soul sitting in a Garden under a Bower of Uines, prettily
picking the ripest Grapes with her delicate hands, and took such pleasant
pains in that maydenlike exercise, that the well colored blood in her face
began to ware warm, and her cheeks to obtain such an excellent beauty, that
they seemed like two purple Roses intermixed with Hawthorne-buds: whereby King
Arthur grew inamored upon her, and stood for a time senseless through the
extreme passion he took in beholding her be^uty: But at last, recovering his
senses, he spoke to himself in this manner.

Oh most divine Angellica, Natures sole wonder, thou excellent ornament of
Beauty, thy lovely Face painted with a crimson die, thy rosicall Cheeks
surpassing Snow in whiteness, thy decent Neck like purest Iuory, has like a
Fowlers net entangled my yielding heart: whereby it is for evermore imprisoned
in thy breast. Oh that the golden Dresses of thy dainty Hair which shine like
the Rubyes, glittering in the Sun, had never twinckled before my ravished
eyes, then had my heart inioyed his wonted liberty, and my Fancy been free
from Lovers vain imaginations. Thus, and in like manner, complained the King
unto himself, seeking by all means possible to exclude Loves fire from his
breast. But the more he strove to abando^ it, the more it increased: and
feeling no policy might prevail; but that this burning torment must of force
be quenched with her celestial love he descended from his Chamber, and went
bouldly into the Garden; where taking Angellica by the hand as she sat upon a
bed of Uiolets, which as then grew under the Arbor, in this manner began to
court her.

Fair of all faires, (said the King) divine and beauteous Paragon fair Flower
of London, know that since my abode in thy Fathers house, thy beauty has so
conquered my affections, and so bereaved me of my liberty, that unless thou
vouchsafe to cool my ardent desires with a willing grant of thy love, I am
like to dye a lan^uishing death, and this Country England of force must l^ose
him, that has filde her bounds with many triumphant Uictories: therefore
sweet Angellica, if thy hard heart be so obdurate, that the tears of my true
love may nothing molliffe, yet take pity on thy Country, that through thy
cruelty, she loose not her wanton glory, and be made unhappy, by the loss of
her Sovereign: thou see (my divine Angellica) how I, that have made Princes
stoop, and Kings to humble when I have frownde, do now submissiuely yield my
high honor to thy feet, either to be made happy by thy love, or unhappy in
thy hate, that in time to come, Children may either bless, or cu^se thee: Of
these two, consider which thou will perform either with cruelty to kill me or
with clemency to pre^eiue me.

This unexpected request of the King, so amazed Angellica, that her Cheeks were
^tayned with blushing shame, and like a bashful Maiden (for a time) stood
silent not knowing in what manner to answer him, considering he was King of
England, and she but Daughter to an Earl: But at last, when fear and shame
had a while strove together in her heart, she replied in this sort.

Most mighty King (said she) if your entertainment in my Fathers house has
been honorable, seek not the foul dishonor of his Daughter, nor proffer to
blemish the bud of her virginity with the least thought of your unchaste
desires: the loss of which sweet Iemme, is a torment to my soul more worse
then death. Consider with your self (most worthy Prince) the black scandal
that it may bring unto your name and honor, having a Queen a most virtuous
and loyal Princess. Think upon the stain of your marriage bed, the wrongs of
your wedded pheere, and lasting infamy of your own glo^ie, for this I vow (by
Dianaes bright majesty) before I will y^^ld the conquest of my virginity to
the spoil of such unchaste desires, I will suffer more torments, then man's
heart can imagine: therefore (most mighty Sovereign) cease your irreverent
suite, for I will not loose that matchless Jewel, for all the treasure the
large Ocean contains: And in speaking these words she departed thence, and
left the loue-sicke King in the Arthur, complaining to the empty air: where
after he had numbered many determinations together, this he purposed; Never to
cease his suite, till he had gained what his soul so much desired: for
continually at the break of day, when ^irans beauty began to shine, and
Auroraes blush to appears. would he always send to her Chamber window the
sweetest Music that could be devised: thinking thereby so obtain her Love.
Many times would he solicit her with rich gifts, and large promises,
befitting rather an Empress then the Daughter of an Earl, profering such
kindness, that if she had a heart of Iron, yet could she not choose but relent
and requite his courtesies: for what is it that time will not accomplish, having
the hand of a King set thereunto.

Twelve wearydayes King Arthur spent in woing of Angellica, before he could
obtain his hearts happiness, and his souls content: at the end of which
time, she was as plyant to his will, as is the tender twig to the hand of the
Husbandman. But how their secret meaning required a policy to keep their
privy leaves both from King Arthurs Queen, and from old Androgius, Angellicas
Father: and that their secret joys might long time continue without mistrust
of any party whatsoever, this device they contrived: that Angellica should
desire liberty of her Father, to spend the remain of her life in the service
of Diana, like one that a bandoned all earthly vanity, honoring true chastity
and religious life: So, with a den^ure countenance, and a sober grace, she
went unto her Father, and obtained such leave at his hands, that he willingly
condiscended that she should live as a professed Nun, in a Monastery that
the King before time had builded in the City of Lincoln; and so furnishing
her forth with such necessaries as her state required, he gave her his
blessing, and so committed her to Dianaes service.

But now Angellica being no sooner placed in the Monastery and chosen a Sister
of that fellowship, but King Arthur many times visited her in so secret a
manner, and so disguisedly, that no man suspected their pleasant meetings: but
so long tasted they the joys of love, that in the end the Nun grew great
bellied, and bore King Arthurs quittance sealed in her womb, and at the end of
forty weeks, she was delivered; where in presence of the Midwife, and one
more whom the King largly recompensed for their secrecy, she was made a happy
Mother of a goodly son, whom King Arthur caused to be wrapped in a Mantle of
green Silk, tying a Purse of Gold about his neck, and so causing the Midwife
to bear it into the Fields, and to lay it at a Shepherds gate near adjoining
to the City, in hope the old man should foster it as his own: by which means
his Angellicaes dishonor might be kept secret from the world, and his own
disgrace from the murmuring reports of the vulgar people.

This his commandment was so speedily performed by the Midwife, that the very
next morning she stole the young Infant from his Mothers keeping, and bore it
secretly to the place appointed, there laying it down upon a turffe of green
grass: if seemed prettily to smile, turning his crystal eyes up toward the
Elements, as though it foreknew his own good Fortune. This being done, the
Midwife withdrew her self some little distance from that place, and hid her
self closely behind a well grown Oak, diligently marking what should betide
the comfortless Infant: But long she had not there remained, but there
flocked such a number of little Birds about the young harmless Babe, and
ma^e such a chirping melody, that it fell into a silent slumber, and slept as
sweetly as though it had been laid in a Bed of softest Silk.

By this time, the golden Sun began to glister on the Mountain top, and his
sister Luna to withdraw her waterish countenance: at which time, the pleasant
Shepherds began to tune their Morning notes, and to repair unto their foulded
Sheep, according to their woonted manner: Amongst which crew of lusty Swains,
old Antonio approached forth of his Gate with a cheerful countenance, whose
Beard was as white as polished Silver, or like to Snow lying upon the Northern
Mountains: this bonny Shepherd no sooner espied Angelic^es sweet Babe lying
upon the green Hillocke, but immediately he took it up; and viewing
circumspectly every parcel of the rich Uestments wherein it was wrapped, at
last found out the Purse of Gold which the King had tied unto the Child's neck,
whereat the Shepherd so exceedingly rejoiced, that for the time, he stood as
a man ravished with pleasure, and was not able to remove from the place where
he stood: but yet at the last, thinking with himself that Heaven had sen^ him
that good fortune, not only giving him Riches, but withal a Son, to be a
comfort to him in his latter years; so bearing it in to his old Wife, and
withal the Purse of Gold, and the rich Mantle, with the other things: who at
the sight thereof, was as highly pleased as her Husband, when he found it
first: so being both agreed to foster and bring it up as their own, considering
that Nature never gave them in all their life any child, incontinently they
caused it to be thristened, and called by the name of TOM A LINCOLN; (after
the Town where it was found) a name most fitting for it, in that they knew not
whom were his true Parents.

But now speak we again of the Midwife, that after she had beheld how
kindly old Antonio received the young Infant, she returned back unto
Angelicaes Chamber, whom she found bitterly lamenting the loss of her tender
Babe, thinking that some Fayry Nymph had s^olne it away: but such was the kind
comfort which the smooth tonged Midwife gave her in that extremity, whereby her
sorrow seemed the less, and her mistrustfull fear exchanged into smiling
hope: yet neither would the King nor the Midwife at any time whatsoever, make
known unto her what was become of her little Son, but driving her off with
delays and fond excuses, lest having intelligence of his abo^d, she should
(through kind love, and natural affection) go visit him, and so discover
their Loves practices.

Thus lived the most fair Angelica many days in great grief, wishing his
return, and desiring Heaven that the Destinies might be so favorable, that
once again before the fatal Sisters had finished her life, she might behold
her Infants face: for whose presence her very soul thirsted for.

Here will we leave the solitary Lady comfortless and without company (except
it were the King, that sometimes visited herby stealth) and report what
happened to Tom a Lincoln in the Shepherds house.

CHAP. II. Of the manner of Tom a Lincolnes bringing up, and how he first came
to be called the Red-rose Knight: with other things that happened to him.
GReat was the wealth that old Antonio gathered together, by means of the
Treasure he found about the Infants attire, whereby he became the richest in
all that Country, and purchased such Lands and Livings, that his supposed Son
(for wealth) was deemed a fit match for a Knights Daughter: Yet for all this
his bringing up was but mean, and in a homely sort; (for after he had passed
ten years of his age he was set to keep Antonioes Sheep, and to follow
Husbandry, whereby he grew strong and hardy, and continually gave himself to
painful endeauours, imagining and devising haughty and great enterprises: yet
notwithstanding was of honest and vertueus conditions, well featured, valiant,
active, quick and nimble, sharp witted, and of a ripe judgment: he was of a
valiant and invincible courage, so that from his Cradle and infancy, it seemed
he was vowed to Mars, and martial exploits. And in his life and manners is
dec^phered the Image of true Nobility: for though he ob^curely lived in a
Country Cottage, yet had he a superious mind, aiming at state and majesty,
bearing in his breast the princely thoughts of his Father. For on a time
keeping Cattle in the Field amongst other young men of his age and condition,
he was chosen (in sport by them) for their Lord or Knight, and they to attend
on him like dutiful Servants: and although this their election was but in
play, yet he whose spirits were ravished with great and high matters, first,
procuted them to swear to him loyalty in all things; and to obey him as a
King, where, or when it should please him in any matter to command them: to
which they all most willingly condescended. Thus after they had solemnly taken
their oaths, he persuaded them to leave that base and servile kind of life,
seeking to serve in War, and to follow him, being the General: the which
through persuasion they did, and so leaving their Cattle to their Fathers and
Masters, they assembled all together, to the full number of a hundred at the
least: unto whom he severally gave certain Red Roses, to be worn for colors
in their Hattes, and commanded them, that ever after he should be called the
Red-rose Knight. So in this manner departed he with his followers unto
Barnsedale Heath, where they pitched up Tents, and lived long time upon the
robberies and spoils of passengers, in so much that the whole Country were
greatly molested by them.

This disordered life so highly displeased the Parents of these unruly
Outlawes, that many of them died with grief: but especially of all other, old
Antonio took it in ill part, considering how dearly he lou^d him, and how
tenderly he had brought him up from his infancy: therefore he purposed to
practice a mean to call him from that uncivil kind of life, if it might
possible be brought to pass: so in his old days undertaking this tasking, he
traveled toward Barnsedale Heath: into which being no sooner entered, but some
of the ruder sort of these Outlawes ceased upon the old man, and without any
further violence, brought him before their Lord and Captain: who at the first
sight knew him to be his Father (as he thought) and therefore used him most
kindly, giving him the best entertainment that he could devise: where, after
they had some small time conferred together, the good old man brake out into
these speeches.

Oh thou degenerate (quoth he) from natures kind: Is this thy duty to thy
fathers age, thus disobediently to live, ^^cunding thy natural Country with
unlawful spoils? Is this the comfort of mine age: is this thy love unto thy
Parents, who^e tender care has been ever to advance thy estate: Can thou
behold these milke-white Hayres of mine all to rent and torn, which I have
violently martyred in thy absence? Can thou endure to see my dim Eyes almost
sightlesse through age, to droy down Tears at thy disobedient feet? Oh
wherefore have thou infringed the Laws of Nature, thus cruelly to kill thy
fathers heart with grief, and to end his days by thy viti^u^ life? Return,
return dear Child, banish from thy breast these base actions, that I may lay,
I have a virtuous Son: and be not like the viperous brood, that works the
untimely death of their Parents. And speaking these words, grief so exceeded
the bounds of Reason, that he stood silent, and beginning again to speak,
tears trickled from his eyes in such abundance, that they stayed the passage
of his speech: the which being perceived by the Red-rose Knight, he humbly sell
upon his knees, and in this sort spoke unto good Antonio.

Most dear and reverent Lather, if my offense do seem odious in your eyes,
that I deserve no forgiveness, then here behold now your poor inglorious
Son, laying his breast open, ready prepared to receive Deaths remorselesse
stroke from your aged hands, as a due punishment for this my disobedient crime:
but to be reclaimed from this honorable kind of life (I count it honorable,
because it takes of manhood), first shall the Sun bring day from out the
Western Heavens, and the silver Moon lodge her brightness in the Eastern
waves, and all things else against both kind and nature turn their wonted
^^urse.

Well then (quoth Antonio) if thy resolution be such, that neither my bitter
tears, nor my fair int^^aties may prevail to withdraw thy vain folly, then
know (then most ungracious impe) that thou art no Son of mine, but sprung
from the bowels of some vntanted Tiger, or wild Li^nesse, el^e would thou
humbly submit thy self to my reverent persuasions; from whence thou came I
know not, but sure thy breast harbors the tyranny of some monstrous Tyrant,
from whose ^oynes thou art naturally descended. Thou art no fruit of my body
for I found thee (in thy infancy) lying in the Fields, cast out as a prey for
ravening Fowls, ready to be deuowred by hungerstarued Dogs: but such was my
pity toward thee, that I took thee up and ever since have fostered thee as
mine own Child: but now, such is thy unbridled folly, that my kind courtesy is
requited with extreme ingratitude; which sin above all others, the immortal
powers of Heaven do condemn, and the very Devils themselves do hate:
therefore like a Serpent, henceforth will I spit at thee, and never cease to
make incessant prayers to the iustfull Heavens, to revenge this thy monstrous
disobedience.

These words being ended, he gave such an extreme sigh, that his very heart
brake with grief, and he immediately dyed in the presence of the Red-rose
Knight, For whose death, he made more sorrowful lamentation, then Niobe did
for her seven Sons. But in recompense of old Antonioes kind love, that
preserved his infancy from the fury of ravenous Fowls, he intombed him most
stately in the City of Lincoln, whose body he sent thither by certain
Passengers whom he had taken, and withal a thousand pound in treasures, to be
bestowed upon a great Bell to be rung at his Funeral: which Bell he caused
to be called Tom a Lincoln after his own name, where to this day it
remains in the same City: These Passengers being as then rich Merchants of
London having received the dead body of old Antonio, and withal the treasure,
went with all speed unto Lincoln, and performed every thing as the Red-rose
Knight had appointed.

The death of this good old man not only caused a general sorrow through the
whole City, but stroke such an extreme grief to old Antonioes wife, that
she within few days yielded her life to the remorcelesse stroke of the
frowning destinies, and was buried in the same grave where her Husband was
intombed: Whose deaths we will now leave to be mourned by their dearest
friends, and likewise for breuities sake, pass over many stratagems which were
accomplished by the Red-rose Knight and his followers upon Barnsedale Heath,
and return to King Arthur and his Knights, flourishing in the English Court.

CHAP. III. Of the first Conquest of Portingale by the Red-rose Knight, and how
he was the first that ever triumphed in the City of London.
THe report of Tom a Lincolnes practices grew so general amongst the vulgar
sort of people, that at last it came to King Arthurs ears, who imagined in his
Princely mind, that he was sprung of his blood, and that he carried lofty
thoughts of honor planted in his breast, though shrouded under a Country life:
therefore, through kind nature, he purposed to have him resident in Court
with him, that he might daily see his lively sparks of honor show their
resplendant brightness, yet in such obscurity, that he should not know the
smallest motion of his Parentage; therefore he called together three of his
appr^ued Knights, namely Lancelot du Lake, Sir Tristram and Sir ^^^amore, and
gave them in charge, if it were possible, to fetch the Red-rose Knight unto his
Court, of whose aduenturous exployts he has heard so many times reported: and
withal he gave them general Pardon, sealed with his privy Seal, for him and
all his lawless followers.

This Commission being received by the three worthy Knights, they with all
speed armed themselves in rich Corselets, and strong habiliments of War, and
so rode toward Bransedale H^a^h where being no sooner come, and delivered
their message from the King, but the Red-rose Knight gave them an honorable
welcome, and for three days most royally feasted them under large Canuasse
Tents* wherein they slept as securely, as they had been in King Arthurs Court,
or in a strong Castle of war.

After this, Tom a Lincoln selected out a hundred of his resolute Followers,
such as he best liked of, and came with Sir Lancelot, and the rest to the
English Court; where King Arthur not only gave him a friendly entertainment,
but also installed him one of his Knights of the Round-table: and withal
preclaimed a solemn Turniament, that should be h^lden in the honor of this
new made Knight: to which Turniament, assemble* from other Countries, many
Princes, Barons, and Knights of high honor, which behaved themselves most
nobly, and won great commendations of every beholder: but especially the
Red-rose Knight, who for that day, stood as chief Champion against all
comers. In that Turniament, or first days deed of his Knighthood, where
only by his valor and prowess he overthrew three Kings, and thirty other
Knights, all famouzed for Chiualry: whereby he obtained such grace in the
English Court, that he had by the King a pair of golden Spurs put upon his
feet* and generally of the whole assembly, he was accounted one of the brauest
Knights that then lived in the world.

But now mark, how frowning Fortune ended their Triumphs with unlucky News:
for the same day before the Knights had unbuckled their Armours, there arrived
a Messenger, who certified King Arthur, how his Ambassador was unjustly done
to death in the Portingale Court, (which was an Act contrary both to the Faith
of Princes, and the Law of Arms:) For whose death King Arthur grew so enraged,
that he swear by the Honor of his bright Renown, and by the golden Spur of
true Knighthood, the Portingales should repent that inhumane violence, with the
death of many thousand guiltless souls; and that Babes unborn, should have
just cause to curse the first contriuer of that unjust murder: therefore with
all speed he mustered up a mighty Army of Soldiers, and (because he was
continually molested with homebred Mutinies, and treacherous rebellions, the
which himself in person of force must pacify) appointed the Red-rose Knight
as chief General over the Army mustered for Portingale. In which Service,
he accomplished so many famous Exployts, that he was for ever after surnamed,
The Boast of England. For no sooner had he the whole Camp in charge, and
aboard their Ships, but he proved the perfect Pattern of an exquisi^e
Soldier: such a one, as all martial Captains may learn to imitate: for he
so circumspectly ordered his Captains, that in his Camp was never known any
brawle or mu^^nie. ^e was very courteous and liberal, doing honor to all men
according to their deserts. He so painfully and with such care instructed his
Soldiers, that at an instant always (if it were needful) every man by the
sound of a Drum or a Trumpet, was found in his Charge and Quarter. And (to be
brief) his Camp resembled one of the greatest Cities in the world, for all
kind of officers were there found in order: and also a great number of
Merchants to furnish it with all manner of necessaryes. He (...) case
permitted any robberies, privy fighting, force, or violence: but with severity
punished those that were therein found guilty. His desire was, that his
Soldiers should glory in nothing so much, as in Martial prowess, Virtue, and
Wisdom. He evermore gave them their pay without fraud or deceit. He honored,
he praised, he embraced and kissed them, and withal kept them in awe and
subjection: by which means his fame and honor grew so renowned, that his Army
daily increased more and more. For when he first arrived upon the Confines of
Portingale, his Camp grew to be as great as ever was Caesar's, when he
conquered the Western World, and in matchless pro^^esse nothing inferior unto
his. So fortunate were his proceedings, that he made a great part of the
Provinces of Portingale desolate not being intercepted by any, but poyling
every Town and City as he went, until such time a^ the Portingale King had
gathered together a marvelous number os Soldiers, both old, and of much
experience, by reason of the continual Wars that they had with the (...)
Nation adjoining near unto them: But when this Portingale King (like an expert
Soldier) seeing that no way he might resist the English Army, nor expel them
his Country, unless he gave them present Battle, therefore trusting in his
approved Manhood, and the prowess of his Soldiers, he set his Army in a
readiness and so marched forward to meet the Red-rose Knight, and his warlike
followers, which at that time had pitched his Camp in a large Champion Plain,
adjoining near unto the City of ^^shborne, whereas both these Armies met: and
setting them in order (as it became good Captains) there they began (in the
break of the day) she most cruel and terriblest Battle that ever was heard
of, or fought in that age, considering the number of both parties, their
experience and policy, with the valiant courage and prowess of their
Captains.

In great danger continued this fight, till the Sun began to set, with
marvelous ^laughter on both sides; yet remained the victory doubtful,
declining neither to the Portingales, nor yet to the English: but at last
(though long) the Portingales began to saint and fly; more indeed oppressed with
she multitude then for any fear they received in the Eatte^^ for the most part
of them with honor dyed manfully in the Field, some taken prisoners, and the
rest fled for their better safety: but now the Portingale King perceiving his
Soldiers begin to fly, with courage he sought to withdraw them from flight,
resisted in person valiantly the furious rage of the enemy: but in that
enterprise he gained such and so many knockes, that at last he^ was unhorsed,
and for want of reskew, was forced to yield himself as prisoner: whereat the
whole army of the Portingales were discomforted, and the victory fell to the
Englishmen: the which being obtained, the Red-rose Knight with his Army entered
into the City of Lishborne; where the common Soldiers were enriched with
wealthy spoils, and the Kings Palace ran^acked by the Red-rose Knight: where
he took such prisoners as him best liked, and the rest (like an honorable
soldier) he set at liberty, commanding that no violence should be proffered
any way:

After this, setting his Army in a readiness, he marched toward England,
where after some few days (...), he arrived with all his Ho^st, in the
Western parts of Devonshire, and marching toward London, where against his
coming, the Citizens with the Inhabitants of other villages near adjoining,
were that day seen in their most sumptucus and rich attire, every one of them
endeavoring to place himself in some Gallery or Window, that the better and
with more ease they might behold the triumphant return of the Red-rose Knight.
All the Churches in London were on every side set open, hanged round about with
most costly forniture: the streets were also most gloriously beset with green
Boughs, and strowed with Perfumes of no small value: and for the infinite
multitude of people that were seen in the City, there were appointed a
hundred Whiflers most richly attyred to keep the streets plain and open,
whereby the triumphs might have the easier passage: and for that the diversity
of the shows were so many, that they of necessity were constrained to part
them into three several days.

The first day hardly sufficed in good order to bring in the Banners,
Standards, and Ensigns of the Conqueror, the golden Images, and Tables of
price, which were all brought in on C^rts very curiously painted and trimmed.

On the second day, came in the Armor of the Conquered King, as also of all
the other Portingale Lords: and as they were rich, bright, and glittering, so
were they with most cunning ordered and couched in wagons. After these entered
three thousand men, in order, bearing nothing but Money openly to b^e seen,
and that in huge Platters and Uessels of Silver; of which were three hundred
and fifty in number, and four of our men allotted to every vessel: the other
brought in most artificial Tapestry works, beautified with gold and silver.
And thus was the second days Triumph ended, in most pompous s^lemnitie.

Upon the third day, even at the rising of the Sun, with the first Band,
entered (as a joyful sound of Conquest) an infinite number of Flutes, Drums,
and Trumpets, with other like Martial and Warlike Instruments, sounding not
after a most pleasant and sweet manner, but in most terrible sort, as it was
possible to be done, even in such order as they do, when they presently join
Battle. And after them, came a hundred and twenty Kine all white, having
their Horns curiously gilded with Gold, their bodies covered with Uayles,
(which they accounted most sacred and holy) bearing also Garlands of Flowers
upon their Heads, driven by certain young Gentlemen, no less well favored
then gorgeously att^red. After these, followed the Coach of the conquered King
of Portingale, with his own Armor laid thereon openly to be seen of all
men: his Crown and royal Scepter was laid in seemly order upon his Armor.
After his Coach, came Prisoners on foot, with his own natural Children, being
little Infants: and after them followed a great Troup of his Servants and
Officers, as Masters of his Housheuld, Secretaries, Ushers, Controlers,
Chamberlaines, with other Gentlemen of his Court, all in a most sorrowful
manner, seeing themselves brought into such extremity and servitude, that they
moved to companion all such as beheld them. Of the Kings children, there were
two Boys, and one Girl, of age so young and tender, that they had small
understanding of their misfortune and misery.

In this triumph followed the Father his own Children, (after the usage of his
Country) clad in black mourning garments, sorrowing likewise for his hard
misfortune. Then followed sundry of his approved Friends: which, beholding in
that plight their unhappy Prince, brake cut into tears and sighs so bitterly,
that their enemies themselves grieved at their mishaps.

After these, followed one which carried certain precious Stones, that had
been presented to the Red-rose Knight, from some ancient Cities in Portingale,
who immediately followed in person triumphantly in his Iuory Chariot, apparelled
in vestures of purple Tissue, having a Laurel bough in his hand, and a Crown
of the same upon his Head. After him, followed his own Soldiers, both
footmen, and Horsemen, all marching in most decent order, armed with rich
Furniture, holding also each of them a Laurel bough in his hand, their
Ensigns and Banners Souldier-like displayed, sounding Martial Melody in
honor of their triumphant Captain: with many other like presidents, most
royal and magnificent.

Thus in this gallant order marched they to the Kings Chapel, where in the
presence of the King and his Lords, (which came to honor and grace their
Triumphs) they gave thanks to God for their succesfull victory: were after
solemn Service was ended, they departed to King Arthurs Court, where every
one, as well Strangers as others, were most royally feasted.

The Portingale King seeing his kind entertainment in the English Court, where
he was used more like a Friend, then an Enemy, had small care to return home,
but ^rolik'd many a day amongst the English Lords: whose loves unto strangers
be evermore most honorable. But so great were the courtesies that the Noble
King Arthur bestowed upon the Portingales, who for their proffered disgraces,
requited them liberally with honor: and not only sent them home ransomlesse,
but promised to lend them aid and succor from England, if occasion required:
So bearing them company to the Sea side, he most friendly committed them to
the mercy of the winds and waves, which were so favorable, that in short time
they arrived safe in their own Country; where many a day after they remembered
the honorable kindness of the Englishmen, and caused the Chronicles of
Portingale to record the renown of King Arthur, and hi^ ^^^^^ts of the Round
Table.

CHAP. IIII. How the Red-rose Knight traveled from the King of Englands Court,
and how he arrived in the Fayerie-land, where he was entertained by a Maiden
Queen, and what happened to him in the same Country.
NOw, after the Portingales were thus conquered, and sent home with great
honor, the English King and his Lords, rested themselves many a day in the
Bowers of Peace, leau^ng their Armours rusting, and their pampered Steedes
standing in their Sca^les, forgetting their usual manner of wrathful war:
which idle ease greatly discontented the magnanimious Red-rose Knight, who
thought it a stain to his passed glory, and a scandal to his Princely mind to
entertain such base thoughts: and considering with himself how ignorant he
was of his true Parents, and from whence he was descended, he could not
imagine: therefore he purposed to begin a new enterprise, and to travail up
and down the World, till he had either found his Father and Mother, or else
yielded his life to Natures courle in that pretended Journey: so going to the
King, (full little thinking that he was sprung from so Noble a stock) craving
at his Graces hand, to grant him such liberty, for to try his Knighthood in
foreign Countries, whereas yet did never Englishman make his adventure; and so
eternize his name to all posterity, rather then to spend his life in such
homebred practices.

To this his honorable request, the King (though loath to forgo his company,
yet because it belonged to Knightly Attempts) he gave him leave, and withal,
furnished him a Ship at his own proper cost and charges, giving free License
to all Knights whatsoever, to bear him company: amongst which number, Sir
Launcelor du Lake was the chiefest that proferred himself to that Uoyage, who
protested such love to the Red-rose Knight, that they plighted their Faiths
like sworn Brothers, and to live and die together in all extreamities.

So these two English Knights, with the number of a hundred more, all resolute
Gentlemen, took leave of the King, and with all speed went a Ship-boord:
wherein being no s^^ner entered, but the Pylot hoysed Sail and di^an^hored, and
so committed their lives and Fortunes to the pleasure of Neptunes mercy: upon
whose (...) Kingdom the (...) many days sailed, but Ae^^us brazen gates ^u^st
open, and the Winds so violently troubled the swelling waves, that every
minute they were in danger, to end their lives in the bottom of the Seas.

Three months the wind and the waters strove together for supremacy: during
which time, they saw no land, but were driven up and down, to what place the
euer-changing Destenies listed: so at last they sailed beyond the Sun,
directed only by the light of the Stars, not knowing which way to travel
toward land, but in such extrenity for want of Uictuall, that they were forced
to land at a certain Island in the Western parts of the world, inhabited only
by women: where being no sooner on land, and giving God thanks for delivering
them from that mortal peril, but the Red-rose Knight cast up his eyes toward
the higher parts of the Country, and espied more then two thousand women
coming forth at a City gate, all most richly armed with Breast-plates of
Silver, marching in trim array, like an Army of well approved Soldiers: the
which number coming near to the Sea side, they sent two of their Damsels, as
Messengers to the English Knights, willing them, as they loved their lives,
presently to retire again back to the Seas, for that was no Country for their
abode. But when the Red-rose Knight of England had understood the hold message
of the two Damsels, he was sore abashed (considering the number of armed women
he saw before him, and the great dangers they had suffered before on the Sea
for want of v^^^uals) that he knew not in what manner he were best to answer
them: but having a good courage, he at last spoke to the two Damsels in this
sort.

Right Noble Ladies, I have well understood your speeches: therefore I desire
you for to show such favor unto wandering Trauailers, as to tell us in what
Country Fortune has brought us to: and for what cause we are commanded by you
to return to the Sea?

Surely Sir Knight (answered one of the Damsels) this Country whereon you are
arrived, it is not very big, but yet most fertile and commodious; and is
called by the name of the Fayrie-Land: And now to show you the cause why you
are commanded to return, this it is. Not many years ago, there reigned in
this Country a King which had to name Larmos, for wisdom and prowess not
his equal was found in any of these parts of the world. This King had such
continual war against the bordering Ilanders, that upon a time he was
constrained to muster for the same war all the men both young and old which
were found in his Kingdom, whereby the whole Country was left destitute of
men, to the great disconten^ment of the Ladies and Damsels that here inhabited:
whereupon they finding themselves so highly wronged, living without the company
of men, they generally assembled themselves together, with the Daughter of King
Larmos, which is called Caelia, no less in Beauty, then in Virtue and
Wisdom: These Ladies and Damsels being gathered together, with a general
consent, dispatched certain Messengers to the King, and to their Husbands,
willing them to return into their Country, and not to leave their wives and
children in such extremity, without the comfort and company of man. Upon which,
the King answered, that he had besieged his Enemies in their Towns of War;
and before one man should return home till he came with Conquest, his Country
should be lost and made desolate, and the Women given over to the spoil of
his Enemies: Which answer, when the Ladies had received, they took it in such
evil part, that they conspired against their King, and Husbands, and put to
death all the men children that were in the Country; and after determined,
when their Husbands, Fathers, and Friends returned from the War, that they
should the first night of their coming, be slain sleeping in their Beds, and
that never after they should suffer man to enter into their Country. After
this conclusion, they crowned Caelia the Kings Daughter for their Queen: And
so afterward, when the King and his Army returned from his Wars, this bloody
murder was practiced, and not a man left alive, but only the King reserved,
whom Caelia would in no wise against nature murder: but yet notwithstanding,
she delivered him into the hands of her chiefest Ladies, which put him into a
Boat alone, and so sent him to the Sea to seek his fortune. Therefore most
noble Knights, this is the cause, why you may not enter into our Country:
which if you do, and not presently withdraw your selves unto the Sea, the
Ladies will suddenly give you a marvelous Battle.

Now by the Everliving (...) which Englishmen adore, (said the Noble Red-rose
Knight) such extremity have we suffered at Sea, that we are like to perish
and dye with hunger, unless we find some succeur at your hands: and before
we will end our lives with famine, we will enter Battle with those Ladies, and
so dye with Honor in the Field: yet this kindness do we humbly desire at
your hands, to return unto your Queen, and certify her of our poor estate
and necessity, and that we altogether instantly desire her, that if there be
any spark of Virtue, or Nobility harbored in her breast, that she will have
pity upon us, and suffer us not to end our lives by such an unhappy kind of
death.

With this request the two Damsels returned to the Queen and recounted from
word to word the humble suit of the Red-rose Knight, and what extremity they
were in: Which when the Queen understood, and that they were Knights of
England, the fame of which country she had so often heard reports, she
demanded, what manner of people they were, and of what condition? Surely Madam
(answered one of the two Damsels) I never in all my life saw more goodly men,
nor better spo^en: and it is to be supposed, they be the choice of all humane
people, and with their courteous demeanors, are able to draive the merciless
and savage Nation to affect them.

The Queen hearing the Damsels so highly to commend the English Knights,
thinking also upon their request, began (in mind) to have pity of their
misaduentures, and so instantly sent for them, and gave them free liberty to
make their abode in her Country: which incontinently when the English Knights
heard, how they should receive a kind welcome, and a friendly entertainment,
grew so exceeding joyful, as though Heaven had sent them present comfort: so
coming before the Queen and her Ladies, they saluted each other most
courteously, and with great reverence. But when the virtuous Queen beheld
this noble company before her, in all humility, she delivered to a hundred of
her Ladies, the hundred English Knights, and reserved the Princely Red-rose
Knight unto her self: and so were they brought to the Queens Palace, where
every Lady feasted her Knight in most gallant sort, and to their hearts
content. But now when the Queen had the Red-rose Knight in her Chamber, and
had beheld the exceeding beauty of the noble Prince, she took him by the
hand, and led him into one of her Chambers, where the showed him her Riches and
Treasure: and after said unto him in this manner.

Most noble and valiant Englishman, these Riches be all only at thy
Commandment, and also my body, which here I offer up as a gift and Present to
thy divine excellency: and furthermore, there is nothing of value, which I am
Mistress of, but shall be at thy disposing, to the intent that my love may be
acceptable to thy gracious eyes. But when the Red-rose Knight perceived to what
intent she spoke these words, in this manner answered her, saying.

Most dear Princess, and fair Queen of this Maiden country, I give you
right humble thanks for these your courtesies, and by no means possible may I
deserve this high honor you have graced me with.

Oh great Knight (replied then the Queen) the smallest thought of your
honorable mind, is sufficien^ ^o recompense the uttermost of my deserts: yet
let me request this one thing at your noble hands, that never asked the like
favor of any one before, for she that never knew the least motion of love, is
now pricked with a hundred torments: and unless you quench the ardent
affection wherewith my heart is fired, with the pleasant hopes of your
comfortable smiles, I am like to die desperate, and then the world will accuse
you of cruelty, in murdering a consiant Lady: but if it shall please you to
grant me love, and so espouse me according to Himens holy Kites, here shall
you rule sole King, and be the Lord of all this Country.

My right dear Lady (answered then the Red-rose Knight) you have done such
pleasure to me, and to my distressed followers, in preserving us from famine,
as I shall never requite it, though I should spend all the rest of my life in
your Service, And know (most excellent Princess) that there is no adventure so
dangerous, yet at your commandment would I practice to accomplish yet for to
tie my self in Wedlockes bonds, there is no woman in the world shall procure
me: for till I have finished an Adventure which in my heart I have vowed, I
will not link my affection to any Lady in the world. But think not (Madam)
that I refuse your love through disdain: for I swear by the dignity King
Arthur grac^d me with, I should think my self most fortunate, if I had so
fair and noble a Lady, as your divine self.

Most worthy Knight (then answered the Queen) I imagine, that the Gods have
sent you into this Country for two causes principally: The first is, that you
and your followers should be preserved from death by my means: The second is,
that you should inhabit in this Country least it should in short time be left
as a desert wilderness: for it is inhabited only by Women without a King, and
have no other Governor but me, which am their chief Princess: And for so
much as I have succored you, so succor you this desolate City, that it may
be repeopled with your seed: and in so doing, you shall accomplish a virtuous
deed, and win to your names an eternal memory to all ensuing ages.

I confess (quoth the Red-rose Knight,) that you and your Ladies have
succored me and my followers in our great necessity: and in recompense
whereof, we will employ all our endeavors to the repeopling again of this
Country: But in regard of the secret vow my heart has made, I will not yield
my self to your desires; for if I should infringe my oath, mine Honor were
greatly impaired: And before I would commit that dishonorable fact, I would
suffer the greatest torment that man's heart can imagine.

Incontinently, when the loue-sicke Queen heard this answer of the English
Knight, and perceived that he was firm in his purpose, she took leave of
him, and departed for that time, the Red-rose Knight likewise withdrew himself
into his Chamber, pondring in his mind a thousand imaginations. But she for
her part was so troubled in mind, and so wounded with the Darts of blind
Cupid, that when the mistie darkness of night had covered the earth, she laid
her down upon her bed, where betwixt Shame and her Heart, began a ferrible
Battle. Her Heart was encouraged, that she should go and be with him: but
shame began to blush, and withstood that persuasion; by which means the
battle was great, and endured a long time: but at last the Heart was
conqueror, and shame vanquished and put to flight, in such sort, that the
fair Queen arose from her bed, and went and laid her down by her beloved
Knight, where he slept: and being in the bed, she began fearfully to
tremble, for shame still followed her unlawful practices: where after her
quiuering heart began a little to be qualified, with her trembling hand she
awaked him, and after spoke in this manner.

My most dear and affectionat friend, though like a careless wretch I come
unto thee apparelled with Shame, yet let my true Love color this my infamous
presumption: for your Princely person, and Kingly demeanours, like Adamants
have drawn my steeled Heart to commit this shameful act; yet let not my
fervent Affection be required with Disdain: and although you will not consent
to be my wedded Lord and Husband, yet let me be thy Love and secret Friend;
that a poor distressed Queen may think her self happy in an Englishmans
love.

When the noble Knight heard the fair Caelias voice, and felt her by his side
all naked, he was so sore abashed, that he wist not what to do: but yet at
last having the nature and courage of a man, he turned to her, using many
amorous speeches, embracing and kissing each other in such manner, that fair
Caelia was conceived with Child. and wax great of a right fair Son: of whom
she was in process of time safe: ly delivered; as you shall hear discoursed
of large in the following History.

But to be short, during the space of four Months, the Fayery Ladies lay
with the English Knights, and many of them were conceived with their seed in
such sort, that the Country was afterward repeopled with male Children, and
what happened amongst them in the mean season, I will pass over for this
time: for the days and nights (that have no rest) pass on their wonted
course: in which time their Ship was replenished with all necessaries, and
the Red-rose Knight summoned together Sir Lancelot and the rest: and being
assembled, he said unto them.

My good Friends and Countrymen, you know, that long time we have soiorned in
this Country, spending our days in idle pastimes, to the reproach of our
former glories: now my intent is, within these three days to depart this
Country, therefore let every man make himself in readiness: for there is no
greater dishonor to aduenturous Knights, then to spend their days in Ladies
bosoms.

When sir Lancelot and the other English Gentlemen heard the forward
disposition of the Red-rose Knight, they were all exceeding joyful, and
answered him; that with great willingness they would all be ready at the time
appointed.

But now, when the Fayerie Ladies perceived the preparations that the English
Knights made for their departure, they grew exceeding sorrowful, and
complained one to another in most grievous manner: but amongst the rest, the
Queen was most displeased, who with a sorrowful and sad heart came unto the
Red-rose Knight, and in this manner complained to him.

Alas, alas, my dear Lord, have ye that tyrannous heart, to withdraw your
self from me, and to forsake me before you see the fruit of your Noble person,
which is nourished with my blood. Dear Knight, behold with pity my womb, the
chamber and mansion of your blood; Oh let that be a means to stay you, that my
Child (as yet unborn) be not fatherless by your departure. And in speaking
these words, she began to weep and sigh bitterly, and after to whisper
secretly to her self in this order.

Oh you immortal heavens, how may mine eyes behold the departure of my joy!
for being gone, all comfort in the world will forsake me, and all consolation
fly from me: and centrariwise, all sorrow will pursue me, and all misfortune
come against me. Oh what a sorrow will it be to my scule, to see thee floting
on the dangerous Seas, where every minute, perils do arise ready to whelme
thee in the bottomless Ocean! and being once erempted from my sight, my heart
for evermore lie in the bed of tribulation, under the coueriure of mortal
distress, and between the sheets of eternal hewaylings. Yet if there be no
remedy, but that theu wilt needs depart, swear unto me, that if ever thou
do accomplish thy pretended boyage, (what it is I know not) that thou will
return again to this Country, to tell me of thy happy fortunes, and thatmine
eyes may once more be hold thy lovely countenance, which is as delectable to my
soul, as the Joys of Paradise.

When the Noble English Knight understood that the Queen condescended to his
departure, upon condition of his return, to which he solemnly protested, if
the Gods gave him life and good fortune, to perform her request: whereby the
Fayrie Queen was somewhat recomforted: And having great hope in the return of
her dear Love, thee ceased her lamentations. And now (to abridge the Story)
the time came that the valiant Englishmen should go a Ship-boord: upon which
day, the Red-rose Knight and his followers, took leave of the noble Queen and
her Ladies, thanking them for their kind entertainements, and so went to the
Port of the Sea, where they entered their Ships, and so departed from the Fayrie
Land. After this, when Caelia had borne her Babe in her womb full forty
weeks, she was delivered of a fair Son, who came afterward to be called the
Fayrie Knight: which for this time we will not touch, but refer it to the
second part of this History.

CHAP. V. What happened to the English Knights, after their departure from the
Fayrie Land.
WIth a prosperous Wind sailed these English Knights, many a League from the
Fayerie Land, to their great content and hearts desire, where every thing
seemed to Prognosticate their happy Adventures: so upon a day when the Sun
shone clear, and a gentle calm Wind caused the Seas to lie as smooth as
Crystal Ice, whereby their Ship lay floating on the Waves, not able to
remove: For whilst the Dolphins daunc'd upon the silver Streams, and the red
gild Fishes leapt about the Ship, the Red-rose Knight requested Sir Lancelot,
to drive away the time with some Courtly Discourse, whereby they might not
think their Uoyage over long. Unto which, the good Sir Lancelot most willingly
agreed: And although he was a Martial Knight, delighting to hear the
relentlesse sound of angry Drums, which thunders threats from a Massaker, yet
could he like an Dratour, as well discourse a Lovers History: therefore
requesting the Red-rose Knight, and the other English Gentlemen, to sit down
and listen to the Tale that follows.

The pleasant History which Sir Lancelot du Lake, told to the Red-rose Knight,
being a Ship-boord.

AT that time of the year, when the Birds had nipt away the tawny leaves, and
Flora with her pleasant Flowers, had enricht the earth, and encloathed with
Trees, Herbs, and Flowers, with Natures Tapistrie, when the golden Sun with
his glistering Beams did glad men's hearts, and every Leaf as it were, did
bear the form of Love, by Nature painted upon it: This blessed time did cause
the Grecian Emperor to proclaim a solemn Turnament to be holden in his
Covet, which as then was replenished with many worthy and valiant Knights: but
his desire chiefly was, to behold his Princely Son Valentine, to try his
Ualour in the Turnament.

Many were the Ladies that repaired thither, to behold the worthy Triumphs of
this young Prince: amongst which number, came the beautiful Dulcippa, a Maiden
which as then waited upon the Empress, being Daughter to a Country Gentleman
This Dulcippa, like Apollos Flower, being the fairest Uirgin in that company,
had so firmly settled her love upon the Emperors son, that it was impossible
to expel it from her heart. Likewise, his affection was no less in feruencie
then hers: so that there was a just equality in their Loves and liking, though
a difference in their Birthes and Callings.

This Princely Valentine, (for so was the Emperors Son called) entered the
Listes in costly Armor most richly wrought with Orient Pearls, his Crest
encompassed with Sapphire Stones, and in his hand a sturdie Lance. Thus mounted
vron a milke-white Steed, he vaunted forth himself to try his warlike
force: and in prauncing by and down, he many times (through his Beuer) stole a
view of his sayre Dulciopas face: at which time, there kindled in his Breast
two sundry Lamps: the one was to win the honor of the day: the other, to
obtain the love of his Mistress. On the other side, Dulcippa did nothing but
report the valiant arts of his prowess and chivalry, in such sort, that there
was no other talk amongst the Ladies, but of Valentines honorable attempts.

No sooner was the Tournaments ended, and this love begun, but Dulcippa departed
to her lodging, where sighs did serve as bellows to kindle Leaves fire.
Valentine in like manner being wounded to death, still rometh up and down to
find a salve for his stanchlesse thirst: so seeks Dulcippa to restore her
former liberty: for, she being both beloved, and in love, knew not the mean to
comfort her self. Sometime she did exclaim against her wandering eyes, and
wished they had bin blind when first they gazed upon the beauty of Princely
Valentine: Some times in visious the beheld his face cheerful, smiling upon
her countenance: and presently again, she thought she saw his martial hands
bathed all in purple blood, scorning her love and former courtesies. With that
she started from her dreaming passion, wringing her tender hands, till floods
of silver dropping tears trickled down her face: Her golden hair that had
wont to be bound up in threeds of gold, hung dangling now about her Iuory
neck: the which in most outrageous sort she rent and tore, till that her hair
which before looked like burnisht Gold, were died now in purple and Uermillion
blood. In this strange passion remained this distressed Lady, till the Golden
Sun had three times lodged him in the Western Seas, and the silver Moon her
shining face in the Palace of the Crystal Clouds. At this time a heavy
slumber possessed all her senses: for she, whose eyes before in three days,
and as many nights, had not shut up their Closets, was now locked up in silent
sleep, lest her heart ever burdened with grief, by some untimely manner
should destroy it self.

But now return we to the worthy Valentine, who sought not to pine in
passion, but to court it with the best, considering with himself, that a faint
heart never gained fair Lady: therefore he purposed boldly to discover his
love to the fair Dulcippa, building upon a fortunate success, considering
that she was but Daughter to a Gentleman, and he a Prince borne, so attiring
himself in costly Silks, wearing in his Hatte, an In dian Pearl cut cut of
Ruby red. On either side a golden Arrow thrust through a bleeding Heart; to
declare his earnest affection. In this manner went he to his belooued Lady,
whom he found in company of other Ladies waighting upon the Empress: who
taking her by the hand, he led her aside into a Galery near adjoining: where
he began in this manner to express the passion of his love.

Sacred Dulcippa, (quoth he) in beauty brighter then glittering Cinthia, when
with her beams she beautifies the vales of Heaven. Thou art that Cinthia,
that with thy brightness do sight my clowoy thoughts, which have many days
been over cast with stormy showers of Love: Shine with thy beams of mercy on
my mind, and let thy light conduct me from the dark and obscure Laberinthe of
Love. If fears could speak, then should my tongue keep silence: Therefore,
let my sighs be messengers of true Icue. And though in words I am not able to
deliver the true meaning of my desires: yet let my cause beg pity at your
hands. Other wise your denial drownes my soul in a bottomless Sea of sorrow:
one of these two (most beauteous Lady,) do I desire: either to give life with
a cheerful smile, or death with a fatal frown. Valentine having no sooner
ended his loves oration, but she with a scarlet countenance, returned him this
joyful answer.

Most Noble Prince, thy words within my heart, has knit a gordion knot, which
no earthly Wight may untie: for it is knitte with faithful Love, and Tears,
distilling from a constant mind. My heart which never yet was subject to any
one, do I freely yield up into thy bosom, where it for cuermore shall rest,
till the Fatal sisters cut our lives asunder. And in speaking these words,
they kissed each other as the first earnest of their loves. With that the
Empress came through the Gallerie, who espying their secret conference,
presently nursed in her secret hate, which she intended to practice against
the guiltless Lady, thinking it a scandal to her Sons birth, to match in
marriage with one of so base a parentage: Therefore purposing to cross their
loves with dismal stratagems, and dryerie Tragedies, she departed to her
Chamber, where she cloked her treacheries up in silence, and pondred in her
heart how she might end their loves, and finish Dulcippas life. In this
tragical imagination remained she all that night, hammering in her head a
thousand several practices. But no sooner was the deawy earth comforted with
the hot beams of Apollos fire, but this thirsting Empress arose from her
careful bed, penning her self closely within her Chamber, like one that made
no conscience for to kill: she in all have sent for a Doctor of Physic, not
to give Physic to rest^^e health, but poison for untimely death: who being no
sooner some into her presence, but presently she locked her Chamber door, and
with an angry countenance, staring him in the face, she breathed this horror
into his harmless ears.

Doctor, thou know how often in secret matters I have used thy help, wherein
as yet I never saw thy faith falsified: but now amongst the rest, I am to
require thy aid in an earnest business, so secret, which if thou do but tell
it to the whispering winds, it is sufficient to spread it through the whole
world: whereby my practices may be discovered, and I be made a noted reproach
to all hearers.

Madame (quoth the Doctor, whose heart harbored no thought of bloody deeds)
what needs all these circumstances, where duty does command my true obedience?
desist not there, fore gentle Empress, to make me privy to your thoughts: for
little did he think her mind could harbor so vile a thought: but having
coniured most strongly his secrefie, she spoke to him as follows.

Doctor, the love (nay rather raging lust) which I have spied of late betwixt
my unnatural son, and proud Dulcippa, may in short time (as thou know)
bring a sudden alteration of our state, considering that he being borne a
Prince, and descended from a royal race, should match in marriage with a base
and ignoble Maiden, daughter but to a mean Gentleman: therefore, if I should
suffer this secret love to go forward, and seek not to prevent it, the
Emperor might condemn me of falsehood, and judge me an agent in this
unlawful love; which to a void, I have a practice in my head, and in thy hand
it lies to procure thy Princes happiness, and Countries good. Dulcippas father
(as thou know) dwells about three miles from my Palace, unto whose house,
will this day send Dulcippa, about such business as I think best, where thou
shall be appointed, and none but thou to conduct her thither: where in a
thick and bushy grove which stands directly in the midway, thou shall give
her the cup of death, and so rid my heart from suspicious thoughts.

This bloody practice being pronounced by the Empress, caused such a terror
to enter into the Doctors mind, that he trembled forth this sorrowful
complaint.

Oh you immortal powers of Heaven, you guider of my hapless fortunes, why
have you thus ordained me to be the bloody murderer of a chaste and virtuous
Lady, and the true pattern of sobriety: whose vntimelesse overthrow if I
should but once conspire, Dianas Nymphs would turn their wonted Natures, and
stain their hands with my accursed blood: Therefore most glorious Empress,
cease your determination, for my heart will not suffer my hand to commit so
foul a villainy.

And wilt not thou do if then, (repl^ed the Empress with a mind fraught with
rage and blood?) ^ do protest (quoth she) by Heavens bright Majesty, except
thou do consent to accomplish my intent, thy head shall warrant this my
secrecy. Stand not on terms, my resolute attempt is clean impatient of
objections.

The Doctor hearing her resolution, and that nothing but Dulcippas death might
satisfy her wrath, he consented to her request (and purposed cunningly to
dissemble with the bloody Queen) who believed that he would perform what
she so much desired: so departing out of her chamber, she went to the
giltlesse Lady, sending her on this fatal message: who like to hapless
Bellerophon, was ready to carry an embassage of her own death But in the mean
time, the Doctor harbored in his breast a world of bitter woes, to think how
vilely this virtuous Lady was betrayed: and considering in his mind, how that
he was forced by constraint to perform this tragedy; therefore he purposed
not to give her a cup of Poison, but a sleeping Drink, to cast her into a
trance, which she should as a cup of death receive; as well to try her
virtuous Constancy, as to rid himself from so heinous a crime.

But now return we to Dulcippa, who being sped of her Message, went with the
Doctor, walking on the way, where all the talk which they had, was of the
liberal praise of Prince Valentine; who remained in Court, little mistrusting
what had happened to his beloved Lady: and she likewise ignorant of the hurt
that was pretended against her life: but being both alone together in the Wood,
where nothing was heard but chirping Birds, which with their voices seemed to
mourn at the Ladies misfortune, But now the Doctor breaking off their former
talk, took occasion to speak as follows.

Man of all other creatures (most virtuous Lady) is most miserable, for Nature
has ordained to every Bird a pleasant tune to bemoane their misshapps, the
Nightingale does complain her Rape and lost Uirginitie within the desert
Groves: the Swanne does likewise sing a doleful heavy tune a while before
she dies, as though Heaven had inspired her with some foreknowledge of things
to come. Y^^ Madame, now must sing your Swan-like Song; for the pretty Birds (I
see) do drope their hanging heads and mourn, to think that you must die,
Marvel not Madame; the angry Queen will have it so. Accursed am I in being
constrained to be the bloody instrument of so tyrannous a fact. Accursed am I
that have ordained that cup, which must by Poison, stanche the thirst of the
bloody Empress: and most accursed am I, that cannot withstand the angry Fates,
which have appointed me to offer outrage unto virtue. And in speaking these
words, he delivered the Cup into the Ladies hands: who like a Lamb that was
led to the slaughter, used silence for her excuse. Many times lift she up her
eyes toward the sacred Throne of Heaven, as though the Gods had sent down
vengeance upon her giltlesse Soul, and at last breathed forth these
sorrowful lamentations.

Never (quoth she) shall virtue stoop to Uice. Never shall Death affright my
soul: nor never Poison quench that lasting love, which my true heart does
bear to Princely Valentine; whose Spirit (I hope) shall meet me in the
joyful Fields of Elysium, to call those Ghosts, that dyed for Faithful love,
to bear me witness of my Faith and Loyalty: and so taking the Cup, she
said. Come, come, thou most blessed Cup, wherein is contained that happy
Drink, which gives rest to troubled minds. And thou most blessed Wood, bear
witness, that I mix this banefull Drink with Tears distilling from my
bleeding heart. These Lips of mine that had wont to kiss Prince Valentine,
shall now most willingly kiss this Ground, that must receive my Corse. The
author of my death, I Will bless; for she honors me, in that I die for my
sweet Valentines sake. And now Doctor to thee (being the instrument of this my
Death) I do begueath all earthly happiness: and here withal, I drink to
Valentines good fortune: So drinking off the sleeping Potion, she was
presently cast into a trance; which she poor Lady, supposed death. The
Doctor greatly admiring at her virtuous mind, erected her body against an aged
Oak, where he left her sleeping, and with all speed returned to the hateful
Queen, and told her, that he had performed her Majesty's command: who gave him
many thanks, and promised to requite his secrecy with a large recompense.

But now speak we again of Prince Valentine, who had intelligence, how the
only comfort of his heart had ended her life by Poisons violence: for which
cause, he leaves the Court; and converted his rich Attire to ruthful Roabes:
his costly colored Garments, to a homely russet Coat; and so travailing to the
solitary woods, he vowed to spend the rest of his days in a Shepherds life:
His royal Scepter was turned into a simple Sheepehooke, and all his pleasure
was to keep his Sheep from the teeth of the ravenous Wolves.

Three times had glistering Phoebe renewed her horned wings, and decked the
elements with her smiling countenance: Three months were past, three Moons
had likewise run their wonted composse, before the Grecian Emperou mist his
Princely Son: whose want was no sooner bruted through the Court, but he
ecchoed forth this horror to himself.

What cursed Planet thus indirectly rules my hapless course? or what vn^outh
dryery Fate has bereaved me of my Princely son? Jove send down thy burning
Thunderb^lts, and strike them dead that be pro^urers of his want: But, if
(sweet Venus) he be dead for love, houer his Ghost before mine eyes, that he
may discover the cause or his inflictions. But contrariwise, if his life be
finished by the fury of some murtherous mind, then let my exclamations pierce
to the iustfull Majesty of Heaven, that never Sun may shine upon his hated
head, which is the cause of my Valentines decay: Or, that the angry Furies may
lend me their burning whips, ince^santly to scourge their purple souls, till
my Sons wrongs be sufficiently revenged. Thus, or in such a like frantic
humor ran he up and down his Palace, till Reason pacified his outrageous
thoughts, and by persuasion of his Lords, he was brought into his quiet bed.
Mean space, Diana (the Queen of Chastity) with a Train of beautiful
Nimphe^, by chance came through the Wood where Dulcippa was left in her
trance: in which place, rousing the Thickets in pur^uit of a wild Heart, the
Queen of Chastity espied the harmless Lady standing against a Tree, and
beheld her sweet breath to pass through her closed lips: At whose presence,
the Queen a while stood wondering at; but at last, with her sacred she awaked
her, and withal asked the cause of her trance, and by what means she came
thither? Which poor awaked Lady, being amazed both at her sudden Majesty,
and the strangeness of her passed Fortune and distress, with far fetched
sighs, she related what happened to her in those desert Woods. The heavenly
Goddess being moved with pity, with a most smiling voice cheared her up, and
with a Lilly taken from the ground, she wiped the tears from off Dulcippa
tender cheeks, which like to a river trickled from her Crystal eyes. This
being done, Diana with an Angels voice, spoke unto her as follows.

Sweet Uirgine (for so it seems thou art) far better would it befit thy
happy estate (happy I term it) having past so many dangers, to spend the
remnant of thy life amongst my Train of Nymphs, whereas springs nothing but
Chastity and purity of life. Dulcippa, though in her love both firm and
constant, yet did she condescend to dwell with Dianas Nimphs: where now,
instead of parley with courtly Gallants, she sings Songs, Carrols,
Roundelayes: in stead of Pen and Incke, wherewith she was wont to write
Loue-letters, she exercises her Bow and Arrows, to kill the swift-fat Dear:
and her downie Beds, are pleasant Groves, where pretty Lambs do graze.

But now return we again to the raging Emperor, who sifted the matter out
in such sort, that he found the Empress guilty of her Sons want, and the
Doctor to be the instrument of Dulcippas death: who being desperate (like one
that utterly detested the cruelty of the Empress) would not allege, that he
had but set the Lady in a trance, but openly confessed that he had poisoned
her and for that fact was willing to offer up his life to satisfy the Law,
therefore the angry Emperor swears, that nothing shall satisfy his Sons
reuengement, but death: and thereupon straightly commanded the Empress to be
put in prison, and the Doctor likewise to be locked in a strong Tower: but yet
because she was his lawful Wife, and a Princess borne he something sought
to mittigate the Law, that if any on within a tweluemonth and a day would come
and offer himself to combat in her cause against himself, which would be the
appealant Champion, she should have life: if not to be burnt to ashes, in
sacrifice of his Sons death: all which was performed as the Emperor had
commanded.

But now all this while the poor Prince lives alone within the Woods, making
his complaints to the flocks of Seepe and washing their waell with his di^^
ressed tears. His bed whereon his body rested, was turned into a Sun-burnd
bank: his chair of state, covered with grass: his music, the whi^^ling
winds: the Rethoricke, pitiful complaints and means, wherewith he bewailed
his passed fortunes, and the bitter crosses of his unhappy love:

The solitary place wherein this Prince remained, was not far ^distant from
the Grove, where Dullcippa led her sacred life: who by chance in a morning at
the Suns vprising, attyred in green vesiments, bearing in her hand a Bow
bended, and a quiver of arrows hanging at her back, with her hair tied up in
a Willow wreath, least the Bushes should catch her golden Tresses to beautify
their branches: in this manner coming to hunt a savage Heart, she was surprised
by a bloody Satire bent to rape, who with a bloody mind pursued her: and
coming to the same place where Prince Valentine fed his mourning Lambs, he
ouertooke her, whereat she gave such a terrible shrike in the Wood, that she
stird up the Shepherds princely mind to rescue her: but now when the bloody
Satyr beheld a face of Majesty shrouded in a shepherds clothing, immediately
he scudded through the Woods more swifter then ever fearful Dear did run.

But now gentle Reader, here stay to read a while, and think upon the happy
meeting of these Lovers: for surely the imagination thereof will lead a golden
wit into the Laberinth of heavenly joys: but being breathless in avoiding
passed dangers, they could not speak a word, but with steadfast eyes stood
gazing each other in the face: but coming again to their former senses,
Vailentine brake silence with this wavering speech.

What heavenly wight art thou (quoth he) which with thy beauty have inspired
me?

I am no Goddess (replied she again) but a Uirgin vowed to keep Diana
company, Dulcippa my name: a Lady sometime in the Grecian Court, whilst happy
fortune smilde; but being crossed in love, here do I vow to spend the remitant
of my days. And with that, he catching the word out of her mouth, said.

Oh you immortal Gods: and is my Dulcippa yet alive? I, I, alive I see she is:
I see that sweet celestial beauty in her face, which has banished deep
sorrow from my heart: and with that kissing her, he said. So, see, fair of
all faires that Nature ever made, I am thy Valentine, thy unhappy Love, the
Prince of Greece, the Emperors true Son, who for thy lovely sake, am thus
(...), and for thy love, have left the gallant Court, for this (...) and homely
country life. With that, she took him about his manly neck, and breathed
many a bitter s^^h into his bosom: and after with weeping tears, discoursed
all her passed dangers, as well the cruelty of the Empress, as of the
virtuous deed of the good Doctor. And having both recounted their passed
fortunes, they confented (disguised as they were) to travel to the Grecian
Court to see if the Destenies had transformed the state of the Emperor or his
regiment; for now no longer outcries, nor heavy stratagems, or sorrowful
thoughts sought to pursue them; but smiling fortune, gracious delights, and
happy blessings. Now Fortune never meant to turn her wheel again, to cross
them with calamities, but intended with her hand to power into their hearts
oil of lasting peace. Thus whilst Apolloes beams did parch the tender twigs,
these two Lovers sat still under the branches of a shadie Beech, recounted
still their joys and pleasures: and sitting both thus upon a grassy bancke,
there came traveling by them an aged old man: bearing in his withered hand a
staff to stay his benumbed body: whose face when Prince Vallentine beheld,
with a gentle voice he spoke unto him in this sort.

Father, God save you: How happens that you weeried with age, do travel
through the desert Groves, befitting such as can withstand the checkes of
Fortunes sicklenes? Come fair old man sit down by us: whose minds of late
were mangled with grief, and crossed with worldly cares.

This good old Hermit hearing the courteous request of the Prince, safe down
by them, and in sitting down, he fumbled forth this speech.

I come (young man) from yonder City, whereas the Emperor holds a heavy
Court, and makes exceeding sorrow for the want of his eldest Son, and for a
Lady which is likewise absent: the Empress being found guilty of their wants,
is kept close prisoner, and is condemned to be burnt, unless within a
tweluemoneth and a day, she can get a Champion that will enter Battle in her
cause: and with her, a Doctor also is adjudged to suffer death. Great is the
sorrow that is there made for this noble Prince, and none but commends his
virtue: and withal the deserved praises of the absent Lady.

Father (replied then the Prince) thou have told us tidings full of bitter
truth, able to enforce an iron heart to lament: for cruel is the doom, and
most unnatural the Emperor, to deal s^hardly with his Queen.

Nay (quoth the old man) if she be guilty, I cannot pity her, that will cause
the ruin of so good a Prince: for higher powers must give example unto their
subjects.

By Lady Father (quoth the Princely Shepherd) you can well guess of matters
touching Kings; and to be a svitnesse of this accident, we will presently go
unto the Court and see what shall betide unto this distressed Queen. This
being said, they left the aged man, and so travailed toward the Grecian Court:
and by the way, these Lovers did consult, that Prince Valentine attired like a
Shepherd, should offer himself to combat in his Mothers cause, and so to
express the kind leave and nature which was lodged in his Princely breast. But
being no sooner arrived in the Court, and seeing his Father to take the combat
upon himself, presently he kneeled down, and like an obedient Senne,
discovered himself, and withal Dulcippas strange fortunes: whereupon the
Empress and the Doctor were presently delivered, and did both most willingly
consent to join these two Lovers in the bands of Marriage: where after they
spent their days in peace and happiness.

This pleasant Discourse being ended, which Sir Lancelot had told to the
exceeding pleasure of the greatest company, but especially of the Red-rose
Knight, who gave many kind thanks. At this time the winds began to rise, and
blow cheerfully, by which they sailed on their journey succesfully from one
coast to another, till at the last they arrived upon the coasts of Prester
John's Land, which was in an evening when the day began to loose her crystal
Mantle, and to give place to the Sable garments of gloomy night: where they
cast Anchor, unseen of any of that Country Inhabitants.

CHAP. VI. What happened to the Red-Rose Knight, and his company in the Court
of Prester John, and how the Red-rose Knight slew a Dragon with three tongues,
that kept a golden Tree in the same Country: with other attempts that happned.
THE next Morning by the break of day, the Red-rose Knight rose from his
Cabin, and went upon the Hatches of the Ship, casting his eyes round about,
to see if he could epsy some Town or City where they might take harbor:
and in looking about he espied a great spacious City, in the middle whereof
stood a most sumptuous Palace, having many high Towers standing in the air
like the Orecian Piramides, the which he supposed to be the Palace of some
great Potentate: therefore calling Sir Lancelot (with two other Knights) unto
him, he requested them to go up into the City, and to enquire of the
Country, and who was the Governor thereof; the which thing they promised to
do: so arming themselves, (as it was convenient, being strangers in that
Country) they went up into the City; where they were presently presented unto
Prester John, who (being always liberal and courteous unto Strangers) gave
them a royal intertainment, leading them up into his Palace: and having
intelligence that they were Englishmen, and aduenturous trauaileurs, he sent
four of his Knights for the rest of their company, desiring them in the
Knights behalf, to return to the Court, where they should have a friendly
welcome, and a Knightly entertainment.

Thus when the Red-rose Knight had understood the will of Prester John, by his
four Knights, the next evening with his whole company he repaired to the
City, which was right Noble and fair, and although it was night, yet were
the Streets as light as though it had been midday, by the clear resplendant
brightness of Torches, Cressetts, and other Lights which the Citizens ordained
to the intertaining of the English Knights. The Streets through which they
passed to go to the Kings Palace, were filled with people, as Burgomasters,
Knights, and Gentlemen, with Ladies and beautiful Damsels, which in comely
order stood beholding their coming. But when the Red-rose Knight was entered
the Palace: he found the renowned Prester John sitting upon his Princely
Throne, under propt with pillars of Jasper stone: who after he had given them
an honorable welcome, he took the Red-rose Knight by the hand, and led him up
into a large and sumptious Hall, the richest that ever he had seen in all his
life: But in going up certain stayres he looked in at a window, and espied
fair Anglitora the Kings daughter, sporting amongst other Ladies; which was
the fairest maid that ever mortal eye beheld, and I think that Nature her
self could not frame her like: but being entered the Hall, they found the
Tables covered with costly fare ready for supper: when as the English Knights
were set at the Kings Table in company of Prester John and Anglitora, with
other Ladies attending (having good stomaches) they fedd lustily; but Anglitora
which was placed right over against the Red-rose Knight, fed only upon his
beauty and princely behavior, not being able to withdraw her eyes from his
divine excellency: but the renowned Prester John for his part, spent away the
supper time, with many pleasant conferences touching the country of England
and King Arthurs princely Court: the report of which fame, had so often sounded
in his ears. But amongst all other devises, he told the English Knights of a
Tree of gold, which now grew in his Realm, and yearly brought forth golden
fruit, but he could not enjoy the benefit thereof, by reason of a cruel Dragon
that continually kept it: for the conquest of which golden tree, he had many
times solemnly proclaimed through that part of the World, that if any Knight
durst attempt to conquer it, and by good fortune bring the adventure to an end,
he should have in reward thereof his Daughter the fair Anglitora in marriage:
to which many Knights reserted as well of fortaine Countries, as his own
Nation; but none proved so fortunate to accomplish the wished conquest, but
lost their lives in the same adventure: therefore I fully believe, if all the
Knights in the world were assembled together, yet were they all insufficient to
overcome that terrible Dragon.

With that the Red-rose Knight with a bold courage stood up, and protested by
the love he bore unto his countries King, he would perform the enterprise, or
lose his life in the attempt: so in this resolution he remained all supper
time, which being ended, the English Knights were brought into diverse chambers:
but amongst the rest, the Red-rose Knight and Sir Lancelot were lodged near
to the fair Anglitora, for there was nothing betwixt their Chambers, but a
little Gallery: into which being come, and no sooner laid in their beds, but
the Red-rose Knight began to confer with Sir Lancelot in this manner.

What think you (quoth he) of the enterprise I have taken in hand? Is it not a
deed of honor and renown?

Surely (replied Sir Launcelat) in my judgment it is an enterprise of death:
for every man in this country adiudgeeth you overcome and destroyed, if you
but once approach the sight of the Dragon, therefore be advised, and go not
to this perrilous adventure, for you can obtain nothing thereby but reproach
and death: and doubtless they are counted wise that can shun the misuentures,
and keep themselves from danger.

But then (quoth the Red-rose Knight) shall I falsify my promise; and the
promise of a noble mind ought still to be kept: therefore, ere I will
infringe the Uow I have made, I will be devoured by the terrible Dragon, And in
speaking these words they fell asleep.

During which time of their conference, fair Anglitora stood at their chamber
door and heard all that had passed betwixt them, and was so surprised with the
love of this gentle Red-rose Knight, that by no means she could restrain her
affections: and returning to her chamber, casting her self upon her Bed
thinking to have slept, but could not, she began to say secretly to her self,
this sorrowful lamentation.

Alas mine Eyes, what torment is this you have put my heart unto? for I am not
the woman that I was wont to be, for my heart is fiered with a flame of amorous
desires, and is subject to the Love of this gallant English Knight, the beauty
of the world, and the glory of Christendom. But fond feel that I am,
wherefore do I desire the thing which may not be gotten, for I greatly fear,
that he is already betr^thed to a Lady in his own Country. And furthermore
his mind is garnished with Princely cogitations, that I may not enjoy his
Love: and he thinks no more of me, then on her that he never saw. But grant
that he did set his affection upon me, yet were it to small purpose; for he
is resolved to adventure his life in the conquest of the Golden tree, where he
will soon be deuowred by the terrible Dragon. Ah, what a grief and sorrow
will it be to my heart, when I shall hear of his untimely death for he is the
choice of all Nature, the Prince of Nobility, and the flower of worship: for I
have heard him say, that he had rather die honorably in accomplishing his
Uow, then to return with reproach into England. Which happy country, if these
eyes of mine might but once behold, then were my soul possessed with
terrestrial joys. Anglitora with these words fell asleep, and so passed the
night away till the day came: who ^o sooner with his bright beams glistered
against the Palace walls, but the Red-rose Knight arose from his bed, and
armed himself in great courage, ready for the adventure: where after he had
taken leave of the King, and all the rest of his English friends, he departed
forth of the City toward the Golden tree, which stood in a low valley, some
two miles from the Kings Palace:

This morning was fair and clear, and not a cloud was seen, the elements and
the Sun cast his resple^dant beams upon the earth: at which time the Ladies
and Damsels mounted upon the highest Towers in the Palace, and the common
people came up to the battlements and walls of Churches, to behold the
adventure of this valiant Knight, who as then wet most joyfully on his journey,
till he came to the veil of the Golden tree, wherein being no sooner entered,
but he beheld a most cruel and terrible Dragon come springing out of his
hellow Cave. This Dragon was far more bigger then a horse; in length full
thirty foot, the which incontinently as soon as he was out of his Cave,
began to raise his neck, set by his ears, and to stretch himself, opened his
throat, and casting forth thereat most monstrous burning flames of fire: Then
the Red-rose Knight drew cut his good Sword, and went toward him, whereat the
Monster opened his terrible throat, whereout sprang three tongues, ^asting
forth flaming fire in such sort, that it had almost burnt him. The first blow
that the Knight struck, hit the Dragon betwixt the two eyes so furiously that
he staggered: but being recovered, and feeling himself most grievously hurt,
he discharged from his throat such abundance of thick ^^^ing smoke, that it
blinded the Knight in such sort, that he saw nothing: but yet not withstanding
he lifted up h^^ Sword, and discharged it upon the Dragon where he imagined
his head was, and struck so furious a blow, that he cut off his three tongues
close by their roots: by which the Dragon endured such marvelous pain, that
he turned his body so suddenly round, that his tail smote the valiant Knight
a mighty blow upon his back, whereby he fell down upon the Sands; being thus
overthrown, he was in mind most marvelously ashamed, but after a while,
having recovered himself, he ran to the Dragon again, and with his good
Sword smote such a terrible blow upon his tail, that it cut it off in the
middle: the which piece was seven foot in length. The Dragon through the great
pain that he felt, came and incountred the Knight in such a fashion that he
beat him down to the ground, and after stood over him as though he had been
dead: but the Knight took his Sword, and underneath him thrust it up to the
Hilts so far that it pierced his heart: which when the Dragon felt as smitten
to death, began to run away with the Sword sticking in his belly, thinking to
have hidden himself in his Cave but his life departed before he could get
thither. Incontinently, when the Red rose Knight had rest himself, and saw
that the Dragon was dead, he recomforted himself, and went and drew out his
Sword from his belly, which was all to be-stayned with his black blood; and
after took the Daragons three Tongues and ^^ucke them upon his Sword; and
likewise pulled a branch from the golden Tree, which he bore in his hand: and
so in triumph went toward the City: and being come within the sight thereof,
he lifted up the Golden branch into the air as high as he could, that it
might glister in the Sun for the people to behold, (which stood upon high
Turrets, expecting his coming,) who perceiving it, with great admiration began
to wonder. Some there were that gathered green Herbs and Flowers, and
strewed the way whereas the Knight should pass to go to the Kings Palace,
saying: that all Honor ought to be given to so noble and glorious a
Conqueror.

Fair Anglitora amongst all other, was most joyful, when she beheld the
glistering brightness of the Golden branch, and commanded her Waighting-maydes
to put on their richest attyres, to solemnize the honor of that excellent
Uictory.

And to conclude, he was met at the City gate, with the mellody of Drums and
Trumpets, and so conducted to the Kings Palace: where he was right honorably
entertained of Prester John and his Nobles. Surely there is no man so
elloquent, that can discourse by writing the great joy that Anglitora took at
his return: and generally the whole Inhabitants had thereat exceeding pleasure.

But now when the valiant Red-rose Knight had entered the Hall, and had set the
Golden branch upon an Iuory Cupboard richly furnished with costly Plate, the
English Knights and many other Ladies began to dance most joyfully, and to
spend the time in delicious sports till Supper was ready, and then the King and
the Red-rose Knight was set: and with them, the noble and fair Anglitora,
Launcelat du Lake and other English Knights: where (all supper while) there was
no other conference holden, but of the valiant encounters of the Red-rose
Knight: who for his part did nothing but make secret love signs to fair
Anglitora.

What shall I make long circumstances? The Supper passed, and the hour came
that the general company withdrew them into their Chambers, the Red-rose
Knight was conducted to his Lodging by many Noble men and others, which brought
the Golden branch after him, and so bequeathed him for that night to his silent
rest. But presently after the Noblemens departure, Anglitora entered into his
Chamber, bearing in her hand a silver Basin full of warm perfumed Waters, the
which she had provided to wash the Dragons blood from his body: which when the
Red-rose Knight perceived, and thinking upon the kind love that she proffered
him, put off his Clothes, and made himself ready to wash. Fair Anglitora
being attired in a white Frocke without sleeves, turned up her Smock above her
elbowes, and so with her own hands washed the body of the Red-rose Knight.

But now when this gentle Batcheler beheld her lovely Body, her fair and round
Breasts, the whiteness of her Flesh, and that he felt her Hands marvelous
soft, he was so much inflamed with the ardent desire of love, that in
beholding her Beauty, he began to embrace her, and kissed her many times most
courtiously: and so after, when he had been well washed, Anglitora caused him
to lie in his Bed, beholding his well formed limbs, of color fair and
quick, and could not turn her eyes from his sight: Thus as they were
beholding each other without speaking any word, at last the noble Knight spoke
to her in this manner.

Most dear Lady, you know that by this Conquest, I have deserved to be your
Husband; and you, through kind love, to be my Wife; whereby I may say, that you
are mine, and I am yours: and of our two Bodies, there is but one: Therefore I
require you to seal up the first quittance of our loves, which is, that we
two for this night, might sleep together: and so accomplish the great pleasure
that I have so long frished for.

Ah most Noble Knight (answered the fair Lady) what in me lies (that may
bring you the least motion of content) shall with all willingness be
performed: But yet I conjure you by the promise of true Knighthood, that you
will save mine Honor, lest I be made a scandal to my Fathers glory.

There is no man in the world (quoth he) that shall preserve thine Honor more
then I. What if you sleep this night with me in bed, do you any more then
your duty, in that I am your Husband, and best beloved Friend.

My dear love (replied she again) there is no pleasure which I will deny ye:
but for this night, you shall have patience* for I will never yield up the
pride of my Uirginitie, t^ll my Father has given me Marriage: and therefore I
desire you, that to morrow you will request that favor at his hands: which
being granted and performed, then accomplish your content.

When the Red-rose Knight had understood his Ladies mind, he like an
Honorable Gentleman, was content to obey her request. What shall I say more?
but that the night drew on to the wonted time of sleep, which caused those two
Lovers (for the time) to break off company. Here slept the Red-rose Knight
till the next morning: which at the break of day, was presented with a Consort
of Music, which the King himself brought into his Chamber. Their melody so
highly contented his mind, that he threw them a Gold chain, which was wrapped
about his wrist: a gift plainly expressing the bounty that beautified his
princely breast. The Musicians being departed, he arose from his rich Bed, and
went unto the King, whom he found as then walking in a pleasant Garden: of whom
he requsted his Daughter Anglitora in marriage, in recompense of his adventure.
The which request so displeased the King, that all his former courtesies was
exchanged into sudden sorrow, and would by no means consent that Anglitora
should be his betrothed Spouse; and answered: that first he would loose his
Kingdom, before she should be the wife of a wandering Knight.

The noble Red-rose Knight, when he understood the unkind answer of Prester
John (all abashed) went unto Sir Launcelat, and his other friends, and
certified them of all things that had happened: who counseled him, that the
next morning they should depart.

After this conclusion, they went to the King, and thanked him for the high
Honor he had graced them with: and, after that, went and visited their
Ship, where for that day they passed the time in pleasure: and so when the
scouling night approached, the Red-rose Knight went to the fair Anglitora, and
certified her of the unkind answer of her cruel Father: whereat thee grew
sorrowful, and grieved in mind: but at last better considering with her
self, she yielded her fortune fully at his pleasure, promising, that for his
love, she would forsake both Country, Parents, and Friends, and follow him to
what place soever he pleased to conduct her. And it is to be supposed, that
this night the fair Anglitora took all the richest Jewels which she had, and
trussed them in a fa^dle, and so when it was a little before day, she came
unto the Red Rose Knight and awaked him: who presently made him ready, and so
departed secretly from his Chamber, till they came to their Ships: where they
found all the rest of the English Knights ready to depart: So, when they were
all a Board they hoysted Sail, and departed from the Port. To whose happy
journey, we will now leave them for a time, and speak of the discontents of
Prester-Iohn, who all that night was exceeding sorrowful for the unkind
answer, which he had given to the Red-Rose Knight, and so Melancholy that he
could neither sleep nor rest: but at the last he concluded with himself,
that he would go and convey the English Knights (at their departing) unto
their Ships; to the end that being in other countries, they might applaud his
courtesies used to Strangers.

So in the morning he arose and went to the Chamber where the Red rose Knight
was lodged, whom he found departed contrary to his expectation. After that, he
went into his Daughters Chamber, where he found nothing but relentlesse walls,
which in vain he might speak unto: whose absence drove him into such a
desperate mind, that he suddenly ran to the Sea coasts, where he found many
of his Citizens, that showed him the Ships wherein the English Knights were,
which was at that time from the Port or Haven, more then half a mile Then the
King (weeping tenderly) demanded of them, if they had seen his Daughter
Anglitora? To whom they answered, that they had seen her upon the Ship
hatches in company of the Red-rose Knight. At which the King bitterly lamented,
beating his Breast, and tearing his milke-white Hair from his Head, using such
violence against himself, that it greatly grieved the behold^^^.

At that time there was many of his Lords present, who by gentle persuasions,
withdrew him from the Sea coasts to his Palace: where he many days after,
lamented the disobedient flight of his Daughter.

CHAP. 7. How Caelia the Queen of the Fayrie Land was found dead, floting upon
the waves of the Sea: with other things that happened to the English Knights.
MAny days the winds blew cheerfully in such sort, that the English Ships
were within ke^ning of the Fayery Land: at which Sir Lancelat took an occasion
to speak unto the Red-rose Knight, and put him in remembrance how he had
promised Caelia to return into her Country: unto which he answered, and
said: That he would keep promise, if the Destenies did afford him life. And
thereupon commanded the Master Pilot to make thitherward: but the winds net
being willing, raised such a Tempest on the Sea, that the Ship was cast a
contrary way, and the Mariners by no means possible could approach the Fayery
land. At which time, the noble Queen Caelia stood by the sea side upon an high
Rock, beholding the English Ship as it passed by, as her usual manner was
every day standing, expecting her dear Loves return, many times making this
bitter lamentation to her self.

Ah gentle Neptune, thou God of Seas and Winds, where is my desired Love:
bring him again unto me, that day and night we peth for his company. Thus
she complained at the same instant when her Lovers Ship sailed by; for surely
she knew if by the Banners and Ensigns which were displayed in the wind: but
when the poor Lady perceived the Ship to turn from her, she was sore abashed
and dismayed. In stead of joy, she was forced to weep tears: and instead of
singing, was constrained to make sorrowful complaints. In this manner she
abode there all that ensuing night, and caused Fires and great Lights to be
made on the shore, thinking thereby to call the Red-rose Knigh^. unto her.

This order kept she every day and night for the space of six weeks, wayling
the want of him, whom she loved more dear then her own heart: but when the
six weeks were past, and that the Fayerie Queen perceived that she should
have no tidings of her Love, she went from the Rock (all in despair.) into
her Chamber; where being entered, she caused her Son to be brought unto her,
whom she kissed many times, for the love she bore unto his Father: and after
beholding the little Infant, crossing her Arms, with a sigh coming from the
bottom of her heart, she said: Alas my dear Son, alas thou can not
speak to demand tidings of thy Father, which is the brauest Knight, the most
virtuous, and the most valiant in Arms that God ever formed. Oh where is
Nature (sweet Babe) that should enjoin thee to weep, and my self more then
thee, for the less of so brave a Prince; whose face I never more shall see? Oh
cruel and unkind Fortune: my heart has concluded, that I go and cast my
self, headlong into the Sea, to the intent, that if the Noble Knight be there
buried, that I may lie in the same Sepulcher or Tomb with him: where
contrariwise, if he be not dead, that the same Sea that brought him hither
alive, bring me to him being dead. And to conclude, before I commit this
desperate murder upon my self, with my Blood I will write a Letter, which
shall be sewed to my Uestments or Attire, to the intent that if ever my body
be presented to the Red-rose Knight, that then this bloody Letter may witness
the true love that I bore him, to the hour of my death.

Many Ladies and Damsels were in her company whilst thus she lamented her
Knights absence: who hearing of her desperate intended death, made exceeding
sorrow. Some there were that so mightily grieved, that they could not speak
one word: other some there were that sou^ht to persuade her from her desperate
intent: but all in vain. For she presently went from them and with her own
blood writ a Letter, and wrapping it in a Sear-cloth, and then solved it to the
Uestures wherein she was clothed: then taking her Crown, she bound it from
her head with a Golden chain which the Red-rose Knight before time had given
her. Then when she had done all this, she came to her little Sun, and many
times kissed him, and ^o delivered him to the Ladies and Damsels to be
nourished: and so after taking leave of them all, she departed toward the sea,
whether being ^o^te, the went to the top of the high rock, where she began to
look down upon the Sea, and after casting her self upon the Earth, looking
up toward Heaven, she said.

Thou God of my Fortunes, Lord of the Winds and Seas: thou that broughtest
into this country the right perfect Knight, in beauty, manhood, and all
virtues, grant that when my soul has made passage out of this world, my body
may be intombed in his b^ some: which words being said, she turned her eyes
toward her Palace, and spoke with a high voice: Adue my dear Babe, adue you
glistring Towers, my royal Palace: a^ue Ladies and Damsels: and lastly, adue
to all the world, And in saying so, she cast herself into the Sea, and there
desperately drowned her self.

But yet such was her fortune, that the waves of the Sea bore her dead body the
same day to the English Knights Ship, which as then lay in a Road where they
had cast Anchor for to rest that night, and to be short, it so happened at the
same hour when her dead Body was cast against the Ships, the Red-rose Knight
went up the Hatches to take the fresh air: where (looking about) he espied the
dead Lady richly attyred in cloth of Gold, that gorgiously stone in the Water,
the which he presently caused to be taken up and brought into the Ship: where
looking wi^hly upon her, he knew her perfectly well: and after stooping to
kis^e her pale Lips, he found the bloody Letter which he had compeled,
^r^pt in Seare-cloth: so, taking it and reading the contents thereof, his Blood
began to change, and to war red like the Rose, and presently again as pale
as ashes. Whereat Sir Launcelat and the other Knights were greatly abashed, but
especially Anglitora, who demanded the c^use of his grief? Whereunto the
Red-rose Knight was not able to answer a word, the sorrow of his heart so
exc^eded: yet not withstanding, he delivered the bloody letter to Anglitora,
the contents whereof are these that follow.

The bloody Letter of Queen Caelia.
THou bright Star of Europe, thou Chosen of England for prowess and beauty:
When will thou return to fulfill thy promise made unto her, that many a day
has had her eyes planted upon the Seas after thee, shedding more tears in thy
absence, then the Heavens conteineh Stars? Ah my dear Love, make thou no
reckoning nor account of thy promise that thou made to me at thy departure?
know thou not, that every noble mind is bound to keep his word, upon pain
of reproach and shame? but thou have infringed it, and have broken thy oath of
Knighthood: which no excuse can recover. For since I last saw thy Ship
floating on the Seas. I never came within my Palace till the writing hereof,
nor never lay in Bed to take my rest, nor never sat in judgment on my
Countries causes: but for the space of forty days, I stood upon a Rock,
expecting thy return, till famine constrained me to depart. There have I stood
day and night, in rain and in snow, in the cold of the morning, and in the
heat of the Sun; in fasting, in prayers, in desires, in hope; and finally,
languishing in despair and death: Where, when I could hear no news of thy
return, I desperately cast my self into the Sea, desiring the Gods, that they
would bring me either alive, or dead to thy presence, to express the true
affection that I have ever borne thy noble Person: Thus fare thou well. From
her that lived and dyed with an vnsported mind.

Thine own true Lover, till we meet in the Elizian fields: thy unhappy Caelia
Queen of the Fayerie Land.

THus when fair Anglitora had read those bloody lines, she greatly lamented
her unhappy death: and withal, requested the Red-rose Knight, in that she dyed
for his sake, to bear her Body into England, and there most honorably intombe
it: to which he most willingly consented. So causing her body to be inbalmed,
they hoysted sail, and departed toward England: into which Country, they
within four months safely arrived. At whose coming, the Inhabitants and
dwellers, greatly rejoiced, but chiefly the Red-rose Knight and his company,
who at their first ariuall, kneeled down upon the Earth, and gave God thanks
for preserving them from so many dangers and perils, to their high renown, and
triumphant victoryes.

After this, they intombed the body of Caelia most honorably as befitted a
Princess of her calling. This being done, they departed toward Pendragon
Castle, standing in Walls, where as then King Arthur kept his royal Court:
where being arrived, they found the King, and many other Nobles in a readiness to
give them a Princely welcome: amongst whom was fair Angelica the Nun of
Lincoln, mother to the Red-rose Knight; yet kept in so secret a manner, that
neither he, nor she, had any suspicion thereof, but spoke one to another as
mere strangers, The discovery of whom, discoursed at large in the second part
of this History: as likewise the strange fortune of Caelias little Son,
which the Ladies in the Fayerie land called by the name of the Fayerie Knight;
and by what means he came to be called the Worlds Triumph: with many other
strange accidents, etc. But now (to conclude this first part) the Red-rose
Knight and the fair Anglitora were solemnly married together, and lived long
time in King Arthurs Court in great joy, and tranquillity, and peace.

To the Reader.
PRomise is debt, (gentle Reader) I have therefore performed what in my first
Part I promised; which was, to show thee the unfortunate death of the Red rose
Knight, his beloved Lady Anglitoras disloyal affections toward him, his
Childrens Honors, Renownes, and Dignities: and in the period of this small
History, his death both justly, truly, and strangely revenged: The reading of
which (if with good consideration) I doubt not but shall bring unto thee much
pleasure and delight, being (for the quantity thereof) nothing inferior to
the best that has been written of the like Subject (I mean) of Knights
adventures, and Ladies beloved. I therefore dedicate this to thy reason,
knowing that this old Proverb may confirm my expectation, which is; That good
Wine needs no Bush: nor a pleasing History craves no shelter. Farewell.

The second part of the famous History of Tom a Lincoln, the Red-rose Knight,
etc.
CHAP. I. How Tom a Lincoln knew not his Mother, till forty years of his age,
nor whose Son he was: Of King Arthurs death, and his dying speeches, and of
what happened thereupon.
WHen Arthur, that renowned King of England (being one of the nine Worthies of
the World) had by twelve several set Battles, conquered the third part of
the Earth; and being wearied with the exploytes of Marti, all adventures, in
his old days betook himself to a quiet course of life; turning his Warlkie
habiliaments, to divine Books of celestial meditations: that as the one had
made him famous in this World, so might the other make him blessed in the World
to come. Seven years continued quiet thoughts in his breast: seven years
never heard he the sound of delightful Drums; nor in seven years beheld he
his thrice worthy Knights of the Round Table, flourishing in his Court: by
which means his Palace grew disfurnished of those Martial troops, that drew
commendations from all foreign Kingdoms. In this time, most of those
renowned Champions, had yielded their lives to the conquering Tyranny of pale
Death, and in the bowels of the Earth lay sleeping their eternal sleeps, the
royal King himself laden with the honor of many years; and having now
(according to nature) the burden of death lying heavy upon his shoulders: and
the stroke lifted up to divide his body from his soul, he called before him
all the chiefen of his Court: but especially his own Queen, the Red-rose
Knight, and his Lady Anglitora, with the fair Angellica, the Nun of
Lincoln, whom he had so many years secretly loved: and being at the point to
bid a wafull farewell to the world, with Countenance as Maiestical as King
Priam of Troy, he spoke as follows.

First, to thee my loved Queen, must I utter the secrets of my very soul, and
what wanton escapes I have made from any nuptial Bed, otherwise cannot this
my laboring life, depart from my fading body in quiet: Long have I lived in
the delightful sin of Adultery, and polluted our marriage Bed with that vile
pleasure: pardon I beseech thee and with that forgiveness (which I hope will
proceed from thy gentle heart) wash away this long bred evil the Celestaill
powers have grauated me rem^ssion. Then turning to Angellica the Nun of
Lincoln, he said.

Oh thou my youths delight: thou whose love has bereaved my Queen of much
marriage pleasure: thou, and but only thou, have I offended withal, therefore
divine Angellica, forgive me: I like a rauisher spotted thy Uirginitie, I ^r^pt
thy sweet budde of Chastity; I with flattery won thy heart, and led thee
from thy Fathers house (that good Earl of London) to feed my wanton desires:
by thee had I a Son, of whom both then and I, take glory of: for in his
worthynesse remain the true Image of a Martialist; and this renowned Knight of
the Red-rose, is he: He lives: the fruit of our wanton pleasures, borne at
Lincoln, and there by a Shepherd brought up, few knowing (till now) his true
Parente, Ma^^aile not dear Son: think not amiss sweet Queen: for thou my
lovely Angellica: Be not dismayde you honorable States, here attending my
dying hour: for as I hope presently to enter into Elysium Paradise, and wear
the Crown of disertfull Glory, I have revealed the long secrets of my heart,
and truly brought to light those things, that the darkness of oblivion has
covered. Now the Mother knows her Son, the Son the Mother. Now may this
valiant Knight boast of his Pedigree, and a quiet content satisfy all your
doubts. Thus have I spoke my mind, and thus quieted, my soul bids the world
farewell. Adue fair Queen, adue dear son, farewell lovely Angellica; Lords and
Ladies adue unto you all: you have seen my life, so now behold my death: as
Kings do live, so Kings must die. These were the last of Kings Arthurs words:
And being dead, his death not half so amazed the standers by, as the strange
speeches at his lives farewell.

The Queen in a raging jealousy fretted at her Marriage wrongs, protesting in
heart, to be revenged upon the Nun of Lincoln.

The Nun of Lincoln, seeing her wantonness discovered, took more grief
thereat, then joy in the finding of her long lost Son; supposing now, that (the
King being gone) she should be made a scandal to the world.

The Red-rose Knight, knowing himself to be begot in wantonness, and borne a
Bastard, took small joy in the knowledge of his Mother.

Anglitora (Tom a Lincolnes Wife) exceeded all the rest in sorrow, bitterly
sobbing to her self, and in heart making great lamentation, in that she had
forsaken Father, Mother, Friends, Acquaintance, and Country, all for the love
of a Bastard, bred in the womb of a shameless Strumpet: therefore she
purposed to give him the slip; and with her own Son (a young gallant Knight,
named the Black Knight, in courage like his Father) to travail toward the
Kingdom of Prester John, where she first breathed life and her Father reigned.

In this melancholy humor spent they many days, troubling their brains with
diverse imaginations. The Court, which before rung with Delights, and flourished
in gallant sort, now thundered with Complaints; every one disliking his own
estate: Discontent as a proud Commander governed over them, and their
Attendants were idle Fancies, and disquiet Thoughts: and to speak troth, such
a confused Court was seldom seen in the Land; for no sooner was Kings Arthurs
Funeral solemnized, but the whole troops of Lords, Knights and Gentlemen,
Ladies, and others, were (like to a splitted Ship torn by the Tempest of the
Sea) severed, every one departed whither his Fancy best pleased.

The Red-rose Knight conducted his Mother Angellica to a Cloister in Lincoln,
which place she had so often polluted with her shame, there to spend the
remnant of her life in repentance; and with her true Lamentations, to wash away
her black spots of sin, that so grievously stayneth her Soul: and from a
pure Uirgine, made her self a desolute Strumpet.

Likewise, King Arthurs widdowed Queen, like to irefull Hecuba, or the tealous
Juno, kept her Chamber for many days, pondering in her mind what revenge she
might take upon Angellica her Husbands late favorite.

On the other side Anglitora Lady and Wife to the Red-rose Knight, with her
Son the Black Knight, made provision for their departure toward the Land of
Prester John, where she was borne: so upon a night when neither Moon nor
Starlight appeared, they secretly departed the Court, only attended on by a
Negar or Black-more; a Slave fitting to provide them necessaries, and to carry
their Apparel and Jewels after them; whereof they had abundant store: The
Black Knight her Son, (so called rather by fierce courage, then this black
complexion) was all fiered with the ardent desire that he had to see his
Graundsire. Prester John: therefore without taking leave of his Father (being
then absent in the company of his lewd Graunde mother) with a noble spirit
conducted his mother to the Sea side, where a ship was ready then to hoyst
Sail, where of the Pilots they were most willingly received for Passengers.
And in this manner departed they the Land, the Black Knight wore on his Helmet
for a Scutchon, a black Raven feeding on dead men's flesh; his Caparisons were
all of black velvet imbrodered, which most lively figured forth the black
fury lodged in his Princely boosome. Anglitora his Mother, had the attire of
an Amazon, made all of the best Arabian silk, colored like the changeable hue
of the Rainbow: about her neck hung a Jewel of a wounderfull value, which
was a Diamond cut in the fashon of a Heart split asunder with a Turkish
Semiter: betokening a doubt that she had of her Knights loyalty. The slavish
Moore that attended them, went all naked, except a shadow of green Taffata
which covered his privy parts: upon his foot a Morischo Shoe, which is
nothing but a Soale made of an Asses hide, bucklde with small Leathers to his
insteps upon his Head he wore a Wreath of Cypres gilded with pure gold, and a
Plate of Brass about his neck close locked, with the word bond-slaue engraven
about it. In this manner passed they the Seas, and was by these strange habites
wondered at in all Countries where they came: In which travels we will leave
them for a time, and speak of other things pertinent to our Story.

CHAPTER. 2 Of Tom a Lincolnes strange manner of traveling, his woeful
departure from England, and of his sorrowful lamentations for the unkindness
of his Lady.
WHen Tom a Lincoln (the Red-rose Knight) had spent some two months in the
company of his Mother at Lincoln, giving her as much comfort as a Son might,
he left her very penitent for her lives amiss, and returned to the Court,
where he left both his Wife and her Son, the Black Knight, thinking at his
ariuall, to find so joyful a welcome, and so courtious an intertainement,
that all the black clouds of Discontent might be blown over by their happy
meeting: but as ill chance had allotted all things fell out contrary to his
expectation; for he neither found Wife, Child, Servant, nor any one to make
him answer: His Plate and Treasure was deminished, his household Furniture,
imbesselled, and by Thieves violently carried away, he had not so much as one
Steed left in his Stable, for them the Queen had seized on for her use: and
furthermore (by her commandment) a Decree was made, that whomsoever in all the
Land showed him any duty, or gave him but homely reverence, should loose their
heads, for she had entitled him, The base borne seed of Lust, a Strumpets
brat, and the common shame of the dead King. This was the malice of King
Arthurs widow: and assuredly Queen Juno never thirsted more for the confusion
of Hercules then she did for Tom a Lincolns overthrow: But yet this grief
(being cast from a Princess favor, to a vulgar disgrace) was but a pleasure,
to the sorrow he took for the miss of his Lady and Son: No news could he
hear of them, but that they were fled from the fury of the angry Queen:
which was but a vain imagination laid upon the envious time: but far
otherwise did mischief set in her foot, the doting mind of his Lady
Anglitora intended to a further reach, which was to abandon his presence for
ever, and to think him as ominous to her sight, as the killing Cockatrice. The
effect of this his Wives sudden dislike, she had caused (before her
departure) to be carved in stone over the Chimny of his lodging, how that She
deserved damnation to leave Father, Friends, and Country, for the disloyal
love of a Bastard.

Of all griefs to him this was the very spring, the root, the deapth, the
hight: which when he had read, he fell into a sound, and had it not been
for two Pages that attended him, he had never recovered: in this agony the
veins of his breast sprung out into blood, and all the parts of his body
swate with grief: down fell he then upon his knees, and immediately pulled
the King from his finger. which she had given him when they were first
bethrothed, and washed it with his tears, kissing it a hundred times: All that
ever he had from her did he wash in the blood that trickled from his b^esome
and after bound them in a Cypress to his left side, directly where his heart
lay, protesting by that God that created him, and was the guide of all his
passed fortunes, never to take them thence, till either he found his Lady, or
ended his life. He likewise made a solemn vow to Heaven, never to out his
Hair, never to come in Bed, never to wear She, never to taste Food, but
only Bread and Water, nor never to take pleasure in humanity, till he had
eased his grief in the presence of his dearest Anglitora, and that her love
were reconc^led to him.

Being thus strangely resolved, he discharged his Servants and Pages, giving
them all the wealth that he had, and clad himself in tand sheeps skins, made
close unto his Body, whereby he seemed rather a naked Wild man bredde in the
Wilderness, then a sencible creature brought up by civil conversation. Thus
bare footed, and bare legged, with an Iuory Staff in his hand, he set forward
to seek his unkind Wife, and unnatural Son: giving this woeful farewell to
his native Country.

Oh you celestial Powers (quoth he) wherefore am I punished for my Parents
offenses? Why is their secret sins, made my public misery? What have I
mis-done, that my Wife resists me, and like a discourteous Lady forsakes me,
making her absence my present calamity.

Oh thou gracious Queen of Love, I have been as loyal a servant in thy
pleasures, as ever was Hero to her Leander, or Pryamus to his Thisbie: Then
what madding fury, like a cruel commander, has taken possession of my
Anglitoras heart, and placed infernal conditions, whereas the pure virtues of
modest behavior had wont to be harbored? It cannot be otherwise, but the
enraged Queen with her vn^uenchable Envy, has driven her hence; and not only
of one heart made two, but of two seeks to make none; which is, by untimely
death, to work both our confusions: therefore proud Queen, fa^^well: let all
the furies haunt thee, and may thy Court seem as hateful to thy sight, as the
torments of Hell fire to a guilty Conscience. Ungrateful England likewise adue
to thee, for all the honors I have brought into thy bounds, and with the
spoils of foreign Countries, made thee the only Prince of Kingdoms: yet
thou repayest me with disgrace, and load'st me with more contempt, then my
never conquered Heart can inture: so kissing the ground with his warm lips,
that had so long fostered him, and with many a bitter tear, and deep sobbe,
like a Pilgrim, (as I said before) he took leave of his native Country, and
so went to the Sea side; where he heard of his Wife and his Sons departure,
after whom (as soon as the Wind conveniently served) he took shipbord: Where
we will now likewise leave him to his fortune upon the Sea, and speak of the
professed malice the Queen prosecuted against Angellica, the mother of the
Red-rose Knight.

CHAP. 3 Of the woeful death of Angellica, Mother to the Red-rose Knight, and
of the death of the jealous Queen and others.
THe beauteous Angellica, being left by her Son, the Red-rose Knight, (at
his departure) in a Monestarie at Lincoln, there to bewail her former
offenses; and for her youths pleasure, in age to taste the bitter food of
sorrow: the day time she spent in grieved passion (...) night she wasted with
s^ghs and heartbreaking sobbes: she fed on careful thoughts, her drink was
streams of salt tears: her companions, thoughts of her passed wanton
pleasures: her bed no better then the cold earth: her sleeps were few, but her
comforts less: her continual exercise, was with a Needle to work in silk
upon the Hangings of her Chamber, how she was first woed, then won to King
Arthurs pleasures, in what manner their meetings were, their wanton daliances,
his embraces, her smiles: his Princely gifts, her courteous acceptance: and
lastly, the birth of her thrice worthy Son, his bringing up, his honors in
the Court, and his strange discovery: all which she had wrought, as an Arras
work, with silk of diverse colors, in a piece of the purest Holland cloth.
In doing this, twice had the golden Sun run his circumference about the
world, twice had the pleasant Spring beautified the Earth with her changable
mantles, twice had nipping Winter made the Fields barren, and the Woods
leafelesse: and twice had the year showed himself to all mankind: in which
time of twice twelve months, every day made she a sorrowful complaint for
the wrack of Honor, and her Uirginities loss, which so willingly she
surrendered: in this time, so greatly had sorrow and grief changed her, that
her eyes (which had wont like twinkling Diamonds to give light to all
affections) were now sunk into their Cells, and seemed like a hollow Sepulcher
new opened: her Face, wherein Beauty her self dwelt, and her Cheeks the true
die of the Lilly and the Rose intermixed, now appeared old and writhen, like to
the countenance of Hecuba when her husband King Priamus, and all her Princely
Children were slain at Troyes destruction: and her tresses of Gold-like Hair,
which like to Indian Wyers hung over her shoulders, were now grown more white
then Thistle down, the Isickles of frozen Ice, or the white mountain Snow:
all these griefs of Nature had not age changed, but the inward grief of her
careful heart.

But now mark the woeful chance that happened, even upon the day, which by
computation she had in former times yielded up her Maidens pride, and lost that
Jewel that Kingdoms cannot recover: upon that hapless day, came there a
Messenger from the Queen, to bid her make preparation for death; for ^^ that
day should be her lives end, and her fortunes period: which she most willingly
accepted of, and took more joy thereat, then to be invited to a Princely
Banquet.

Be not dismayde (said the Messenger) for you shall have as honorable a death
as ever had Lady: seven several Instruments of death shall be presented to
you for a choice, and your own tongue shall give sentence which of them you
will die by: whereupon this Messenger set this sorrowsull Lady at a round
Table, directly in the middle of a very large room, (whereinto he had led her,
hung all about with black; where being placed as to a Banquet, or some solemn
Dinner of State, there entered seven Seruitours in disguised shapes like unto
Murderers, with seven several deadly services in Dishes of silver Plate: The
first, brought in Fire burning in a Dish, if she would, to consume her body to
ashes: The second brought in a Dish, a twisted Ceard, to strangle her to death:
The third, a Dish full of deadly Poison, to burst her body withal: The fourth,
a sharp edgd Rayzor or Knife, to cut her throat: The fifth, an Iron wrack to
tear her body into small pieces: The sixth, a Dish full of live Snakes, to
sting her to death: And the seventh an impoysoned Garment, being worn, that
will consume both flesh and blood. These seven deathfull Seruitours having set
down their Dishes (the least whereof brings present death) she was commanded
by the Messenger, which of them she should choose to die withal, and to make
speedy choice; for he was sworn to the Queen (on whom he attended) to see it
that day accomplished. At these his words, she fell presently upon her knees,
and with a courage readier to yield to deaths fury, then to the mercy of the
living Queen, said as follloweth.

Oh thou guider of this earthly Globe, thou that gave my weak nature over to
a wanton life, and from a Uirgin chaste, have made me an infamous Strumpet: thou
that sufferedst only a King in Majesty to prevail against me, and with the
power of greatness worm me to lewdness; for which I am now doomed to a
present death, and forced by violence, to bid this tempted world a^ue;
Inspire me with that happy choice of death, as my Soul may have an easy
passage from my body. First, to dye by Fire, to an earthly imagination seems
terrible, and far different from nature: secondly, to die with strangling
cord, were base, and more sitting for robbers, thieves, and malefactors:
thirdly, to die by deadly poison, were a death for Beasts and worms, that
feeds upon the bosom of the Earth: fourthly, to die by cutting knives and
slicing razors, were a death for cattle, fowls, and fishes that dies for the
use of man: fitly by an iron wrack to end my life, were a barbarous death, and
against man's nature: but seventhly, to die a lingering death, which is a life
consuming by wearing of impoysoned garments, (where repentance may still be in
company) will I choose: therefore sweet Messenger of my death do thy office,
attire me in these robes; and the manner of my death I beseech thee make known
unto the Queen: tell her (I pray thee) I forgive her; and may my death be a
quiet unto her soul, for my life is to her ears as the fatal sound of night
Ravens, or the Mermaides tunes.

Uaine world, now must I leave thy flattering intisements, and in stead of thy
pomp and glory, must shortly tread the doleful march of pale death: and this
body that has been so pleasing to a Princes eye, must be surrendered up for
worms to feed upon. Many other words would she have spoken, but that the
commanding Messenger (being tied to an hour) caused her to put on the
impoysoned Roabes which no sooner came to the warmth of her body, but the good
Lady after a few bitter sighs, and dreadful gaspes yielded up the ghost,
being (through the extremity of the infectious Garment) made like unto an
Anatomy; which they wrapped in Sear cloth, and the next day gave her burial
according to her estate and so returned to the enraged Queen, keeping then her
Court at Pendragon castle in Wales, into whose presence was no sooner the
Messenger come, but the angry Queen beyond all measure being desirous to hear
of Lady Angellicas death, in a rage ran and clasped him about the middle,
saying.

Speak Messenger speak, is the vile strumpet dead? Is the shame of womankind
tortured? Is my hearts grief by her death banished my boosome? speak for I am
ouermaistred with doubts.

Most gracious Queen (quoth the Messenger) resolve your self of her death,
for the cold earth has enclosed up her body: but so patiently took she her
death, that well might it have moved a Tigers heart to remorse; for in troth,
my heart relented at the manner of her death, Never went Lamb more gently to
the slaughter, nor never Turtledoue was more meek, then this woeful Lady was
at the message of her death: for the Elements did seem to mourn, closing
their bright beauties up to black and sable Curtains; and the very flintie
walls (as it were) sweat at the agony of her death, so gentle, meek and
humbly took she her death; commending her self unto your majesty, wishing
that her death, might be your souls contentment.

And could she be so patient (quoth the Queen) that even in death would wish
happiness to the causers thereof? farewell thou miracle of womankind, I have
been to thee a savage Lioness: I was blinded at the report of thy
wantonness, else had thou been now alive: all my cruelnesse against thee, I
now deeply repent, and for thy dear hearts blood by me so rashly spilt, shall
be satisfied with the lives of many souls. Hereupon, she in a fury
commanded the Messengers head to be stricken off, and seven Seruitours to be
hanged all at the Court Gate, and afterward caused their limbs to be set upon
high Pooles by the Common high ways side, as an example of her indignation.

Never after this hour (such is the remorse of a guilty conscience) could
she sleep in quiet, but strange visions of this Lady (as she thought) seemed
to appear to her: the least noise that she heard whispering in the silence of
the night, did she imagine to be some Furte to dragge her to Hell, for the
death of this good Lady: the Winds (as she imagined) murmured forth Revenge,
the running Rivers hummed forth Revenge, the flying Fowls of the Air
whistled out Revenge: yea every thing that made noise (in her conceit) gave
remorse for Revenge: and till that her own life had given satisfact on by
death for the rume of so sweet a Ladies life, no food could do her good, no
sleep quiet her brain, no pleasure content her mind, but Despair with a
terrible countenance, did evermore attend her, willing her sometime to throw
her self headlong from the top of a Tower, sometime by poison to end her
days, sometime by drowning, sometime by hanging, sometime by one thing,
sometime by another: but at last in the middle of the night, having her heart
deeply ouermaistred by despair, she took a Girdle of pure Arabian Silk,
which Girdle she first word on her Princely Nuptial day when King Arthur
married her: this fatal Girdle she made a riding knot of, and therewithal
upon her Bed post she hanged her sefle. Thus blood (you see) being guiltless
shed, is quitted again with blood.

The Queen being dead, was not so much pitied of the people, as the good Lady
Angellica, little lamentation was made for her death; for every one expected
the like untimely end: but according to the aleadgeance of Subjects her
Noblemen gave her a Princely Funeral, and set over her an Iron Tomb, in
signification that she had an Iron heart, and Flintie conditions.

Here will we leave the dead to their quiet restes, and return to the Black
Knight, and his Mother Anglitora, with the Indian slave that attends them: sor
strange be the accidents that happen to them in foreign Countries: and
after, we will speak what happened to the Red-rose Knight on the Sea.

CHAP. 4 By what means Anglitora became a Curtizan, and how her Son the
Black Knight lost himself in a wildernesie.
THE Black Knight, his Mother Anglitora, and the Black-(...) slave, having
happily cr^st the Seas, and arrived in a Country very ^ertill to see to,
replenished with all kind of Trees and Fruit, yet were there no Inhabitants to
find, but only an old Castle built of Flui^ stones, the Turrets whereof were
made like the Grecian Piramedes, square and very high: At this Castle gate they
knocked so boldly (each one careless of all accidents that might vappen) as it
rung into the Chamber were the Knight of the Castle lay: who immediately sent a
very low statur d Dwarffe to see who knocked, and if they were strangers, to
direct them up into his Chamber to take such kind courtesies as the Castle
afforded: for indeed he was a Knight of a bountiful condition, and full of
liberality. The Dwarffe no sooner coming to the Gate, and espying people in
such strange disguised attyres, never having seen the like before, without
speaking one word, ran amazedly up to his Master, certifiing him, that a kind
of people of an unknown nation was arrived, and that they seemed rather Angels
(in shape) then any earthly creatures.

The Knight of the Castle hearing this, came down and met them in a large
square Court paued with marble stone, where he kindly gave them
entertainment, promising them both lodging and other needful things they were
destitute of.

The three Travelers accepted of his courtesies, and being long before
weather-beaten on the Seas, thought themselves from a deep dungeon of
calamities lifted to the top of all pleasures and prosperity; thus from this
paued Court the Knight led them up to his own Chamber, wherein was a fire made
of Juniper wood and Frankincense, which smelled very sweet: the walls were
hung about with rich Tapestrie, whereon was writ the story of Troyes
destruction, the Creation of mankind, and the fearful description of the
latter day of Doom: likewise hung upon the said wales, Instruments of all
sorts of music, with such variety of other pleasures, as they had never
seen the like.

Now while these weary Travelers took pleasure in beholding these things, the
good Knight caused his Dwarffe (which was all the servants that he kept) to
cover the Table, made of Cypress wood, with a fine Damask table-cloth, and
thereon set such dellicates as his castle afforded; which was a piece of a wild
Fore, roasted the same morning, with diverse other services of Fowls, whereof
the Country had plenty: Their bread was made of the Almonds mixed with Goats
milk (for no corn grew in this soil) their Drink, of the wild grape,
likewise mingled with Goats milk; which is in my mind, accounted
restoratiue: to this Banquet were the Travelers placed, where having good
stomachs, they quickly satisfied hunger, and after began to chat of their
adventures what danger they endured by sea, and how luckily they arrived in
that Country, giving the courteous Knight great thanks for his kindness.

On the other side, when the Banquet was ended, every one rising from the
table, he took an Orphirian that hung by, and caused his Dwarffe to dance
after the sound thereof: the strings whereof he himself strayned with such
curiosity, that it moved much delight, especially the Lady Anglitora, whose
eyes and ears were as attentive to the Melody, as Helle^s were to the
inchaunting Music of the Grecian Paris. In this kind of pleasure consumed
they most part of the day, till the bright Sun began greatly to decline, then
the Black Knight in a courageous spirit, said.

Sir Knight (for so you seem to be by your entertainment of Strangers) this
Carpet kind of pleasure I like not, it disagrees with my young desires: the
hunting of untamed Tigers, the Tilts and Tournaments of Knights, and the Battles
of renowned Warriors, is the glory I delight in: and now considering no other
aduentrous exercise, may be found in this Country, but only the hunting of
Wild beasts, I will into the Forest and by manhood fetch some wild Uemson
for my mothers supper.

The Knight of the Castle (seeing his resolution) furnished him with a hunting
Iauelin, and so directed him to the Forest, where most plenty of such
pleasures were: God be his good speed, for we will leave the Black Knight in
his exercise, and speak of the wanton affections of Anglitora, and the Knight
of the Castle, that they cast upon each other: a short tale to make, whereas
two hearts make one thought, the bargain is soon made: the Knight of the
Castle having not had the presence nor society of a Woman in seven years
before, grew as wantonly minded, as the Roman Tarquinius, when he ravished the
chaste Lady Lucretia. On the other side, Anglitora having the venom of
disloyalty, grew so pliable to his desires, that at his pleasure he obtained
that love which in former times the Red-rose Knight adventured his life for;
she that in former times was accounted the worlds admiration for constancy,
was now the very wonder of shame, and the Byword of modest Matrons: this was
the first days entrance into their wanton pleasures, which in all daliance
they spent till the Sun had lost the sight of the Earth: then expecting the
return of the Black Knight, from Hunting, they sat as d^murely, as they had
been the chastest livers of the world* not a glance of wantonness passed
betwixt them, but all modest and ^iuill behauiours; in this sort stayed they
attending for the return of the Black Knight, but all in vain: for having a
wild Panther in chase, he followed so far in the unknown Forest, that he
lost himself, all that night traveling to find the way forth, but could
not; sleep was to him as meat to a sick man; his steps were numberless,
like the stars of heaven, or the sands of the Sea: his devises for recovery
little prevailed, the further he went, the further he was from returning:
thus day and night (for many days and nights) spent he in these comfortless
travails; no hope cheered his heart, no comfort bore him company, but his
patient mind: and now at last, when he saw all means fru^rate, he resolved
to live and die in that sollitary Forest: his food he made of the Fruits of
trees, his drink of the clear ruaning water, his Bed was no better then a
heap of Sun-burnd Moss, his Canopies the azure Elements full of twinkling
lights, his Curtains a row of thick branched Trees, the Torches to light him
to his Bed, the Stars of Heaven, the Melody or Music to bring him asleep,
the croakes of Ravens, or the tearefull cries of night Owls: the Clock to
tell the hours of the night, were h^sing Snakes, and Toades croaking in foggy
grass: his morning Cock the cheerful Nightingale, or the cherping Lark his
companions on the day, were howling Woolues, ravening Lyens, and the wrathful
Bo^res: all (as the Fates had decreed) as gentle to him in fellowship, as
people of a civil government: for to say troth, time and necessity had
converted him to a man of wild conditions: for his hair was grown long and
shaggy, like unto a Satyr: his flesh tanned in the Sun as an Indian: the
nails of his fingers were as the tallents of Eagles, wherewith he could
easily climb the highest trees: garments he had not any, for they were worn
out, and as willingly was he content with nakedness, as in former times he
was with rich habiliments.

Thus lived he for seven years in this desolate Forest, by which time he
was almost grown out of the favor of a man: where for a time we will leave
him, and proceed to other accidents, also we will over pass the leawd lives
of Anglitora and the Knight of the Castle, nor speak as yet any more of their
seven years adultery; for numberless were the sins committed by them in
those seven years, in that accursed Castle.

CHAPTER. 5 How the Red-rose Knight found his Lady, and how he was most
strangely murdered, and buried in a dunghill.
THE Blackamore slave (as you have heard) attended upon them, like an obedient
Servant, and showed all duty and love, till Anglitora gave her body to the
spoil of Lust, and from a virtuous Lady converted her self to a hated
Strumpet, which vile course of life when the Indian perceived, he secretly
departed the Castle, greatly lamenting the wrongs of his Master, the Red-rose
Knight, whose noble mind deserved better at her hands. Day and night traualled
the poor slave toward England, thinking to find his Master there, and to
reveal that which hardly he thought would be believed by him: weary and
oppressed with hunger went he this long Journey: many Provinces he passed
through, before he could learn the way toward England; and then was he so
far from it, as at the first, when he departed from the Castle.

The laboring Husbandman grieved not more to see his Corn and Cattle taken by
Thieves: nor the Merchant to hear of his Ships suncke at Sea, then did this
Indian at his vain travels, and wearisome Iourneyes to small purpose: so at
last setting forward again, he came to the sea side, thinking to hear of
some Ship to give him passage over: but alas, one cross falls after
another, one mischief comes upon the neck of another: and one mischance
seldom happens alone; so as this true hearted Negar stood beholding how the
billows of the Sea beat against her banckes, and the Whale fishes lay
wallowing in the Waves: behold such a tempest suddenly arose, that by the force
thereof, the poor slave was cast into the Sea: but by reason of his Silken
veil tide about his middle, and his great skill in swimming, (as most Negars
be perfect therein) kept himself from drowning: and as good fortune would,
the same tempest drove the weather-beaten ship to the same shore wherein the
Red-rose Knight (his master) was, which Ship had been seven years upon the
Sea in great extreamitie, and before this tide could never see land. By that
time the tempest ended, the Ship floted to land, wherein was left but only
the Red-rose Knight in his Palmers weed (for all the rest were starued up for
want of food) who being weak and feeble, ^limbed to the top of the Hatches,
where when he had perce^ued the Negar laboring for life upon the waters, cast
out a long coard, and so saved him: whom when the Red-rose Knight saw, and
perfectly knew, he fell all most into a trance for joy, supposing his Lady
and Son not to be far distant: but recovering his former senses, he spoke
as follows.

Oh blessed Neptune, have thou vouchsafed to deliver me from the depth of thy
bowels, and cast me on land, where once again I may behold my Anglitora, and
my dear Son, the Black Knight. These seven years famine endured on the
Sea, has been a sweet pleasure to me, in that the end brings me to my
desires. Full threescore of my miserable Companions in this Ship, has death
seized upon, and through Famine, have eaten one another, making their hungry
bowels graves for the others Carcases; and though now this belly of mine (like
the Canibals) have been glutted with humane flesh, and this mouth of mine
tasted the blood of man: yet am I as pitiful as the tender hearted Mother,
forgetting her Sons offenses: and to my Anglitora will be as kind, as if
never she had trespassed: nor like the Grecian Helina, left her married Lord:
So taking the Blackamoore by the hand. He demanded of her welfare, and in
what estate his Son remained? The true hearted Negar could hardly speak for
grief, or utter one word for tears: yet at the last with a woeful sigh, he
uttered forth these heart-killing speeches.

Oh my noble Master (quoth he) by you from a Pagan I was made a Christian: by
you, from a Heathen nation without civility, I was brought to a Land of
Princely government; and by you, till my departure, was I maintained in good
manner: there if I should prove perjured slave, and a false Uarlet toward you,
my body were worthy to be made food for hungry Folvles of the Air, and for
the ravening Beasts of the Fields: therefore now considering that duty binds
me to it, I will reveal such woeful chances; and such disloyal tricks
showed by your Lady as will make your heart tremble, your Sinews shake, and
your hair to stand upright. Anglitora your Lady and Wife, has dishonored
your Bed and polluted that sacred Chamber of secretie, which none ought to
know, but only you two: That marriage vow she made in Gods holy Temple, has
she infringed, and untied the knot of Nuptial promise: in a Country far
from hence has she wrought this hated crime: in a Country unpeopled lives
she in a Castle, which is kept up a Knight of a wanton demeanor; there live
they two in adultery, there live they secreatly sleeping in wantonness: and
therefore these seven years has she made her self the child of shame: All
this with extreme grief do I unfold, and with a heart almost kilde with
sorrow, do I breath out the duty of a servant: if I have offended, let my
death make amends: for what I speak is truly delivered from a heart unfeigned.

All this time of this his sorrowful Discourse, stood the Red-rose Knight in a
bitter agony, like one newly dropped from the clouds, not knowing how to take
these discourtesies: one while purposing to be revenged, and with his nails
to tear out the Strumpets eyes: another while, bewayling her weak nature,
that so easily was won to leivdnesse: but at last, taking to him (the virtue)
patience, he resolved to travel to the Castle, and with his meek persuasions
seek to win her former wickedness, and to forget, forgive, and cast out of
remembrance all these her vnwoman-like demeanours, observing the Proverb, That
fair means sooner winnes a woman, then foul, Thus in company of his true
servant the Negar, he took his journey toward the Castle; where (after four
months travel) they arrived; the Red-rose Knight) by the directions of the
Negar, knocked, and in his Pilgrims habit, desired meat and lodging for
himself and his guide.

The first that opened the Gate, was his own Lady, who immediately, upon the
sight of them blushed, as though some sudden fear had affrighted her; yet
dessemblingly (coloring her acknowledge of them) she in a charitable manner
gave them entertainment and conducted them to a by roame at the back side of
the Castle: into which place she sent them (by her Dwarffe) victuals from her
own Table, with a command, that the next morning they should avoid, and
never more trouble that place.

This message sent by the Dwarffe, much disquseted the Red-rose Knight, and
drove such amaze into his mind, that he grew ignorant what to do: And seeing
his appointed time very short to remain there, he now thought fit to strike
whilst the Iron was hot, and to discover what he was: so taking the Scarffe
of Jewels and Kings tied to his left side against his heart (which she knew
perfectly well to be the gifts of her Love) and by the Dwarffe sent them her:
The which no sooner she beheld, but she openly said to thee Knight of the
Castle, that their secret affections were discovered, and her Husband in the
habit of a Palmer made abode in her House conducted thither by the Moore, to
bring their shame to light, and to carry her thence to England, there to be
punished for her sins. Hereupon the Knight and she purposed the same night
to rid themselves of that fear, and by some violent death send the Palmer to
his last abiding. Disquietnesse attended on all sides for that day, and every
hour seemed ten, till night approached; which at last came, though long looked
for. Then Anglitora in company of the Knight of the Castle, like unto
Murderers, rose from their Bedds, even at that hour of night when mischiefs
are acted, when no noise was heard but the barking of Wolves, the howling of
Dogs, and the croaking of Night-owles, all assistance to black actions: In
this manner came they into the Lodging of the Palmer who for weariness of his
Iourneyes, most soundly slept, little dreaming that such cruelty; could be
lodged in the boosome of his wedded Wife: one whose love he had first gained
with great danger, and always esteemed as dear as his own heart blood. All
signs of duty had she obscured, not any remembrance had she of Womanhood:
Marriage Love was forgotten, their passed joys were as things never been: not
any thought of remorse remained within her; but she more cruel then the new
delivered Bear, or the Tiger starued for meat, by the help of the Knight of
the Castle, took the Scarffe of Jewels (sent her from him the same evening)
and by violence thrust them down the Palmers throat: by which means they
bereaved him of life and without any solemnity due to so brave a man, they
buried him in a Dunghill without the Gate, not shedding so much as one tear
for his death: so great was the (...) of this his (...) full Lady. The poor
Negar they set up to the middle in the ground so surely fastened, that by any
means he could not stir from thence, where we will leave him wishing for
death. The Red-rose Knight, or rather the unhappy Palmer, in his unchristian
like Grave, and the Knight of the Castle with the murtheresse Anglitora, to
their surfeiting Banquets of sin, and return to the Black Knight, which had
lost himself in the Woods.

CHAP. 6. How the Black Knight being lost in a wilderness became a wild man?
how his Fathers Ghost appeared unto him, and in what manner he slew his own
Mother.
BY this time the Black Knight grew so natural a Wilde-man, as though he
had been bredde in the Wilderness: for day by day he sported with Lions,
Leopards, Tigers, Elephants, Unicornes, and such like kind of Beasts, playing
as familiarly with them, as in King Arthurs Court he had done with gallant
Gentlemen. But mark how it happened one day above an other: He chaunched to
walk down into a Ually, where he set himself down by the Rivers side, and
in humane complaints bewailed his own estate, how being borne and breed of a
Princely Race, descended royally should thus consume his days in savage sort,
amongst Wild beasts, and by no means could recover his liberty, or free
himself from that solitary Wilderness, Being in this distress of mind, a
sudden fear assayld him, his heart shiuered, his hair stood upright, the
Elements seemed to look dim, a terrible Tempest tore up huge trees, the
Wild Beasts roared and gathered on a heap together, Birds fell liuelesse
from the air, the Ground as it were trembled, and a sudden alteration
troubled each thing above him: in this amaze sat he a good time, maruelling
what would ensue; at last there appeared (as he imagined) the Ghost of his
Fa^he^ new^y murdered with a countenance pale and wan, with hollow eyes (or
none at all) gliding up and down before him casting such fearful frowns, as
might make the stoutest heart in the world to tremble: and at last, setting
himself before the Black Knight, spoke as follows.

Fearenot my Son, I am the Ghost of thy murdered Father, returned from
Plutoes hollow Region: I came from that burning Kingdom where continually
flames an everlasting Furnace; from the fearful Pit* come I to thee for
revenge: Oh thou my Son, if ever gentle Nature were plyant in thy boosome: if
ever thou tookest pleasure to hearethy Fathers honors spoken of; if ever thou
desire to have thy life meritorious in this world, take to thee thy never
failing Courage, and revenge my death upon thy adulterous Mother: thy Mother
now living in the filthiness of shame, making the Castle where she now
remains in, a lustful stews: there was I murdered, and there buried in a
stinking Dunghill; no man gave me Funeral tears, nor any sorrowed for my
death: I that have dared Death in the face, and purchased Honor in many
Kingdoms, was slain by my own Wife, by my nearest Friend, by my second
self, by Anglitora, by her whom the whole world admired for virtue: Rise
(dear Son) rise, and have thee to that Castle polluted with the shame of thy
wicked Mother: Rise I say, and let the Pauements of that Castle, be sprinkeled
with their detested blood, the blood of that Monster that has not only
dispoyled my marriage bed of honored dignities, but like a tyrant to her
own flesh has murdered me. See how the angry Heavens (as it were) do
threaten my Revenge: hark how Hell-Furies do howl and roar for Revenge: my
Wives Adultery at the hand of Heaven deserves Revenge: My bleeding soul (Oh
my Son wandreth in unquiet paths, till thou workest Revenge: my death and
murder cries (^) for Revenge: then fear not (Son) to act it; for duty, love
and nature binds thee to it, By Heaven, and by that great immortal Throane of
happiness: By that low Kingdom of eternal pains; By the huge watrey Seas I
past to follow her: By Earth and by the Souls of all the mortal men that ever
dyed, I command, ^ha^ge, and constrain thee to persevere in this Revenge,
Hence to that foul defamed Castle, defamed by Adultery defamed by Murder;
there to my Soul do thy latest duty: there, wound thy cursed Mothers breast,
there sacrifice her lives blood, there appease thy Fathers Ghost insenst with
fury; so shall my Soul in joy, enter the Fields of fair Elizeum: But if thou
prouest coward-like, and through fear deny to execute my glorious Revenge,
from this day henceforth shall my pale, wan, lean, and withred Ghost with
ghastly looks, and fearful steps, pursue and follow thee. These were the
words of his Fathers Ghost: and having spoken these words, with a grievous
groan, he vanished. At this his sudden departure, the Black Knight cried
with a loud and fearful voice saying.

My noble Father, stay; Oh stay thy hasty steps: once more let me hear thee
speak. Whether flyest thou? Oh let me hear thy voice again: It will not be,
He is vanished; and my Mother lives as a shame to all our generation. Oh thou
stain of woman-hood: Oh thou bloody Lioness: Oh brutish act: Oh beastly
desires: Where shall I now find a place to shed tears in? for my heart is
rent into ten thousand pieces, and the terror of this deed, is too
intolerable. Rest thou in peace, sweet Father: thou in thy life were both
wise and valiant: thy virtue, wisdom, and manhood made the very enemies to
love thee: Oh then, what fortune had thou, to die by the friendly trust of
thy own Wife, my disloyal Mother, thy nearest friend proud thy greatest
enemy; and by a Woman's malice, that heart was killed, that millions of Foes
could never daunt. Oh sweet Red-rose Knight, most happy had thou been to
have dyed ^^ the Fields of bloody War, and sealed thy lives quittance ^mo^est
renowned Soldiers: then had thy death been more honorable, my wicked Mother
had not murdered thee, nor I been inforst to take such bloody vengeance, as I
intend (dear Father) for thy sake: for let me never breath one day longer,
nor view the next Mornings rising Sun: let me never live imprisoned in this
Wilderness, let nothing prosper that (...) I ^ake in hand, and here let the
world end, if I cease to prosecute a mortal Revenge, as the soul of my
Father has commanded. Hereupon he set forward toward the Castle, conducted
by what chance the Heavens has allotted him: not one step he knew aright,
nor what course to take to find the direct way: but it happened, that a^igni^
fatuus (as he thought) or a goeing Fire, led him the right way out of the
Forest directly to the Castle where his dishonest Mother made her abode. But
coming near unto the Gates, he found all close, and near unto the Castle
the Black-moore set half way quick into the earth, having (for want of food)
eaten most part of the flesh from his arms; whom the Black Knight soon
dug up, and kept alive, to be a furtherance to his intended revenge.

The poor Indian, being thus happily preserved from death, revealed all that
had happned in the said Castle; how his Mother lived in adultery, how his
Father was murdered, why himself was set quick in the earth; and lastly, for
the love of his dead Master, he protested to conduct him through a secret
Uault into the Castle, that in the dead of the night they might the easier
accomplish their desired revenge: Thus lingering secretly about the Castle till
the middle of night: a (time as they imagined) to be the fittest for thee
tragical business: at last the midnight hour came, and through a secret Cell
they entered under the Castle into the Lodging where his Father was murthred.
This is the place (quoth the Negar) where my sad eyes beheld thy Father both
alive and dead; so goeing from thence into the Chamber (which by chance, and
as ill luck had appointed) was through negligence left open, he showed him
the Bed where these Adulterers lay secretly sleeping in each others Arms, Oh
doleful sight, This lust, has made me fatherless, and ere long this Weapon
shall make me motherlesse: ^o kneeling down upon his knees, in a whispering
manner he said unto himself. Ye lowering Destinies, now weaue up the Web of
their two lives that have lived too long, You infernal Furies, draw near:
Assist me thou reuengefull God Nemesis, for on this Sword sits now such a
glorious Revenge, as being taken, the world will applande me for a loving
Son. Having spoken these words, he sheathed his Sword up to the hiltes in
the boosome of the Knight of the Castle, who lying in the arms of Anglitora,
gave so deadly a groan, that she immediately awaked: first looking to the
Knight that was slain in her Arms, thou percciuing her Son standing with
his weapon drawn; yet wreaking in the blood of the dead Knight, meanacing
likewise her death, with ^ woeful shrike she breathed out these words,

Oh what have thou done my cruel Son? Thou have ^laine the miracle of
humanity; and one whom I have chosen ^o be my hearts Parramour, and thy second
Father.

Oh Lady quoth the ( Black Knight) for Mother is too proud a title for thee:
what Fury drives thee to lament ^he deserved death of that lewd blood
shedder, and not rather choose with heart-renting sighs, to bewail the death
of my Father, thy renowned Husband, whose guiltless body, even dead, thou
did despise, by buring him wh^^anly upon a ^ounghill; but Heaven has
granted, and Earth has agreed ^etesting both thy misdeedes, and has sent me
to sacrifice thy blood unto the Soul of my murdered Father, Whilst he was
speaking these words, Anglitora arose from her bed, and in her smock which was
of pure Cambr^^ke) she kneeled to her son upon her bare knees, saying.

Oh thou my dear Son, whom once I nourisht in my painful womb, and fed
thee with mine own blood, whom often I choycely dandled in my arms, when with
lullababyes and sweet kisses I rocked asleep: Oh fatre be it from thee (my
loving Son) to harm that breast, from whom thou first receiuest life: Of
thee (my Son) thy Mother begging life. Oh spare the life, that once gave thee
life, with bleeding tears, I do confess my wanton offenses, I do confess
through me thy Father dyed: Then, if confession of faults may merit mercy,
pardon my life. Obscure not thy renown with cruelty, making thy self unkind
and monstrous in murdering of thy Mother. I charge thee, by thy duty that
thou owe me; by all the bonds of love betwixt a Mother and a Son, by all
the kindness showed to thee in thy infancy, let thy mother live that begs life
upon her bare knees: Do not thou glory in my miseries: let not my tears whet
on thy cruellnesse: let not thy mind be bent to death and murder: be no
^^^age Monster: be not unnatural, rude and brutish: let my intreates prevail
to save my life: wound not the womb that fostred thee, which now I termed
wicked, by only fostring thee, what child can glut his eyes with gazing on
his Parents wounds, and will not faint in beholding them.

Hereupon the Black Knight not able to endure to suffer his Mothers further
entreaties, least pity and remorse might mollify his heart, and so grant
her life (which to Heaven to take away he had deeply sworn) he cut her off
with these deadly words.

Lady, I am not made of Flint nor Adamant; in kind regard of calamity, I am
almost struck with remorce: but duty must quite undo all duty: Kind must
work against kind, all the powers of my body be at mortal strife, and seek
to confound each other, Love turns to Hatred: Nature turns to wrath, and
Duty to Revenge: for me thinks my Fathers Blood with agroning voice, cries
to Heaven for Revenge: therefore to appease my Fathers angry spirit, here shall
thou yield up thy dearest blood. Here was he ready to strike, and with his
sword to finish up the tragedy: but that his grieved soul in kind nature
plucked back his hand: whereupon with a great sigh he said.

Oh Heavens; how am I grieved in mind. Father forgive me, I cannot kill my
Mother And now again, me thinks I see the pale shadow of my fathers Ghost
glyding before mine eyes; me thinks he shows me the manner of his murder;
me thinks his angry looks threatens me and tells how that my heart is
possessed with cowardice, and childish fear; Thou do prevail, O Father even
now receive this sacrifice of blood and death; this pleasing sacrifice, which
to appease thy troubled soul, I hear do offer. And thus in speaking these
words, with his Sword he split the dear heart of his mother; from whence the
blood as from a gushing Spring issued. Which when he beheld, such a sudden
conceit of grief entered his mind considering that he had slain his own
Mother, whom in duty he ought to honor above all living women, that he
rather fell into a frenzy the^ a melancholy; and so with a pale countenance
and ghastly looks, with spartling like to a burning Furnace, began to talk
idly.

What have I done? Whom has my bloody hand murdered? Now woe unto my soul
for I am worse then the Uiperous brood that eats out their Dammes womb to get
life unto themselves: they do but according to nature, I against all Nature;
for I have dug up the boosome that first gave me life. Oh wicked wretch;
where shall I now hide my head? for I have slain my self, in killing her: I
have staynde this Chamber here with humane blood The Heavens abhor me for
this deed: The World condemns me for this murder, and Hell Furies will
follow me with shame and terror: The Gods are grieved, Men (me thinks) ^^ie
my company: dead Ghosts arise in my distresses: I see my Mother comes with a
breast bleeding, threatening confusion to my fortunes. Oh thou ugly Spirit, cease
to follow me, torment me not alive, for the wrath of Heaven is fallen upon my
head. Despair, where art thou? I must find thee out, I will go seek thee
through the world: and if in the world I find thee not, I Will saddle winged
Pegasus, and scale he mantion place of love. I will ransake all the corners of
the ^kie. I will throw down the Sun, the Moon, and Stars: then leaving
heaven, I will go seeks for Despair in the loathsome poole of Hell; there in
Plutoes Court will I bind black Cerberus up in Chains, the triple-headed
Helhound, that Porter of Hell gates, because he let Despair pass from
thence. In this frantike sort ran he up and down the Chamber, and at last
with the nails of his fingers he fell to grave upon the Stone walls the
picture of his Mother, imitating Pigmalion, hoping to have life breathed into
the same. Mean while the poor Indian with fleshlesse arms heaued up toward
Heaven, and on his bare knees, made his supplication to the Gods, for the
Black Knights recovery of his wits.

Oh you angry Heavens (quoth he) revoke your heavy doomes, forget this crime,
forgive this unnatural murder: pity the state of this distressed Knight,
and send some means to recover his senses. Thou bright Lamp of Heaven, thou
eternal light, although in justice we have deserved thy wrath, yet let my
prayers, my never ceasing Prayers, my hearts renting Sighs, my deep enforced
Tears, work some remorce from thy incensed ire, that either this Knight may
recover his lost senses, or set him free from death. Thus in a zealous manner
prayed the poor Negar, desi^ing God to lay the Knights fault upon his head,
and reclaim his unbridled rage: which Prayer was soon regarded by Heaven, for
the Black Knight had immediately his madness turned into a sad melancholy;
and in a more gentle manner made his sad lamentations, as you shall heat in
the next Chapter.

But now the Negar, that all the time of Anglitoras murder stood in a trance,
began now a little (considering the fright he took at the Black Knights
madness) to summon again together his natural senses; and perceiving the
unchaste Lady dead, cold, pale, wanne, lying weltering in her goare, and the
blood of her false heart (shed by her own child) all besprinckled about the
Chamber, said as follows.

Now (quoth the Negar, betwixt life and death) have you shown your self a
dutiful Son, and nobly revenged the death of your Father. These were the
last words of the poor Indian; which as then s^nke down, and never after
breathed* Thereupon came f^orth the Dwarffe of the Castle, with great store of
treasure, proffering the same to the Black Knight; who nothing thirsting after
covetousness, refused it, and withal took the Dwarffe in satisfaction for
the Negars death, and crammed the treasure down his throat; and after buried
the two Servants together in one Grave. This being done he dug up his
Fathers body from the Dunghill, and brought it to the Chamber where his mother
lay and after in an Abbey yard belonging to the Castle, he buried them both
likewise, in one Grave. This being done, he kneeled thereupon, and made his
complaint in this manner.

CHAP. 7 Of the Black Knights melancholy lamentations over the grave of his
Parents; and of other things that happened.
OH thric^ happy for euer-more be this ground that contains the bodies of my
unfortunate Parents; for this Earth has received the sweet Darling of Nature,
and the only delight of the whole World; the Sunshine of Christendom, and the
glory of Mankind: Oh thrice happy be the grass, that from henceforth shall
grow upon this Grave: let never Sith touch it, nor crafty ^urking Serpent with
venomous breath, or deadly poison, hurt it: Let no Lions paws, nor Bears
foot, tread upon it: Let no Beasres Horn in any manner abuse it: Let no Birds
with pecking, nor creeping filthy Uermine, no winters nipping Frost, no nightly
falling Dewes, no rage of the par^hing Suns heat, nor Stars, have power
from Heaven: nor fearful Tempest nor horrible Lightning, in any manner annoy
it: Let no Plough-man drive hither his weary Oren, nor Shepherds bring hither
their Sheep, least by the Bulls rage it be harmed, or by the harmless
Sheep it be eaten: but let it for ever grow, that the displaying thereof may
reach to Heaven: and may from henceforth this Grave be ever accounted sacred:
and may the Grass be ever sprinkled with sweet Waters. Some good man upon
this Grave set a burning Taper, that then for every anguish of my heart, I may
beat my Breasts, till my Fistes have stricken the wind from my body; and that
my Soul may bear them company into Elysium. Come you wanton fleshly Satyrs:
Come you friendly Fawnes: Come you Fayries and Dryades, and sing sweet
Epitaphes; lift up your voices to Heaven, and let your praises be in the
honor of my Parents: my self like a wan, pale, and dead man, will bear you
company: I will weary the World with my complaints: I will make huge Streams
with my Tears: such Streams, as no Bank shall bar: such Streams, as no
Drought shall dry. But alas what do I mean to repeat these several
lamentations: since my dear Parents be dead: since from the world they are
parted: since they are buried without solemnity: since my delights are all
enclosed in the Ground: yet will I still here make my complaints, though no
good ease comes thereby, adding tears to tears, and sorrows to sorrows. Oh
frowning Fortune. Oh unlucky Stars. Oh cursed day that ever I did this deed,
for now no sense, nor knowledge, takes their insensible bodies of my griefs:
in this Grave there is no feeling: in Death there is no pity taken. Oh thou
Siluannus thou commander of these Mountains, help me poor helpelesse soul
to shed tears: for my religion, for my devotion and Countries sake help me:
either let me have some comfort in my sorrows, or let me in Death, bear my
Parents company. Thou see what Torments I suffer; how my heart trembles, how
my eyes flow with tears, how my head is with tears possessed, how my Soul is
full of horrible anguish: all this thou see, and yet it little grieves thee
to see it. Oh thou churlish ground, from henceforth cease any more to bear
Fruit: cease to be decked with Flowers, cease to be mantled in Green, for the
purest Flowers are withered. Thy Garlands are decayed: my dear Parents are too
untimely bereft of life: their sweet bodies thou harborest, and in thy womb
deliuere^st them as a food unto Worms. Therefore thou cruel Earth, howl
andmourne, for thou art unworthy of such blessed bodies. And now, oh you
pitiful Heavens, hear my complaints, convey them to the Souls of my
deceased Parents: for my lamentations by the gentle Winds, are blown from the
East unto the West: the dry Land, and the Watery Seas, are witnesses to them:
Therefore no day shall rise, but it shall hear my complaints: no night shall
come, but it shall give ear unto my mo^nes: neither day nor night, shall be
free from my heartbreaking cries. If that I groan, me thinks the Trees are
bended, as though they pitied my tears. The very Ground (for grief) I see
alters her complexion. All that I hear, all that I see, all that I feel,
gives fresh increase to my sorrow. I will never henceforth come in peopled
Town, nor inhabited City, but wander all alone up and down by low Uallyes,
and sleepy Rocks: or I will dwell in dark Dens frequented only by Wild
Beasts, where no path of man was ever seen, or to the Woods I will go, so
dark, and beset so thick with shadow branches, that no Sun may shine there
by day, nor no Star by night may be seen, whereas is heard no voice, but the
outcryes of horrible Goblings, the balefull shrikes of Nightowles, the vnlukie
sounds of Ravens and Crows; there shall mine eyes be made watery Fountains;
there will I make such plaints, as Beasts shall mourn to hear them; such
plaints will I make, as shall rend and riue strong trees, make wild Panthers
tame, and mollify hard flinty stones: And if by chance that sleep oppress
me, on the bare and cold Ground shall these woeful limbs rest: the green
turffe shall, serve as a Pillow for my head: boughs and branches of trees shall
cover me: and then I hope, some venomous Serpent will speedily give me my
deaths wound, that this my poor soul may be released from flesh and blood: by
which means I may pass to those Fields, those fair Elysium Fields, whereas
my murdered Parents daily resort. In this manner complained the Black Knight
upon his Parents grave, three days and nights together, still kneeling upon
the cold ground and could not by any imagination be comforted: every thing his
eyes beheld, renewed fresh sorrow, and drew on new lamentations: but at last,
the Powers of Heaven intending to grant him some ease, cast his distressed
Senses into a quiet slumber: where lying upon his fathers grave, we will let
him for a time rest.

CHAP 8. How the Fayerie Knight came to be called the Worlds Triumph, Of his
ariuall in England, of the two Knights deaths, and of the Prove rbe used of
three Cities in England.
YOu have read in the first part of this History, how the Fayerie Knight the
Son of Caelia, begot by the Red-rose Knight, was committed (by his Mother at
her death) to the keeping of the Ladies of the Land: for then was there but few
Men living, being a Country only of Women: and now being of lusty age, and a
Knight of renowned valor, he betook himself to travel: the only cause to
find his Father, or some of his kindred whom he had never seen.

Many were the Countries he passed: but more the dangers he endured: all which
for this time, we omit: only a little speak of three gifts given him by an
Hermit, that had three exceeding Uertues: For coming to an Island to seek
adventures, it was his chance to save a young beautiful Maiden from rauishing
by a satyricall Wild-man: for he having tied the golden locks of her Hair to
two knoity brambles, and being ready to take his venerall pleasure upon her,
the Fayerie Knight coming by, and seeing that dishonor and violence offered
to so young a Uirgin, with his Sword at one blow, paired away the Wild-mans
head, and so went with the Maiden home to her Fathers house, which was an
Hermitage some mile distant off: where being no sooner come, but the good old
man, having a Head more white then Silver, but a heart more heavier then Lead,
by reason of the want of his daughter, so cruelly taken from him, began at her
sight to be so cheered, that he had not the power (for joy) to speak a good
space, but at last, taking the fayerie Knight by the hand, he led him to an
inward room, where he banqueted him with such cheer as his Hermitage
afforded; and after in ^^ew of his daughters reschew, he gave him three such
Gifts, and of three such Uertues, as the like seldom had Knight. The first,
was a King, which whosoever did wear, should never dye by treason. The second
a Sword; that on what Gate soever it struck, it would presently fly open. The
third and last, a vial of such Drink that whosoever tasted, should suddenly
forget all passed sorrows.

Having received these three Gifts of the good old Hermit, he departed, and
traveled without any adventure till he came and found the black Knight
afleepe upon his fathers Grave: which when the Fayerie Knight had awaked, in
countenance they were so alike, as Nature had made them both one, (for indeed
they were Brothers by the Fathers side, the one true borne, the other a
Bastard) yet at the first sight, such a secret affection grew betwixt them,
that they plighted their ^aythes to each other, vowing never to part
friendships. But when the Black Knight had revealed his birth and parentage,
his Fathers name, and place of birth, the Fayerie Knight resolved himself,
that he had found a Brother, as well in nature as condition: But when he heard
the story of his Fathers life, and the manner of his death, with the murder of
Anglitora his unchaste wife, he could not choose but shed tears, whereof
plenty descended from his fair eyes: whereupon he took occasion to speak as
follows.

Heaven rest thy sweet soul (my unknown Father,) and may the fruit of thee
prove as famous in the World as thou have been; but more fortunate in their
Marriage choice: As for my Stepmother, though her unchaste life baue made her in
famous to all Womankinde, yet this in charity I desire, that when she comes
to Plutoes Realm, that Proserpine may send her to the blessed fields of
Elysium; in remembrance of whom, in this world, (if ever we ariue in that noble
Country of England, where my Knightly Father was borne,) we will there erect
her a stately Tomb: yet no Epitaph) shall show her disloyal life, nor the
cause of her death: only in Letters of beaten Gold, shall remain engraven
upon her Tomb, the name of, Anglitora Daughter to Prester John, and Wife to
the worthy Red-rose Knight. Hereupon he gave his newfound Brother (the Black
Knight) his Wall of Drink which the Hermit had given him: who no sooner had
tasted, but all former greefes were forgotten: he remembered not the death of
his Father, nor the murder of his Mother, nor what sorrow he had sustained in
the Wilderness: but like a ioconde Knight, gyrt his Sword round about him, and
stood on Thorns till he was set forward to seek Martial adventures.
Hereupon these two Knights departed toward England, and performed many noble
deeds of Chivalry by the way; But amongst all others, being in the Turkish
Court (this is worthy to be noted) for with one Box of the ear, the Black
Knight killed the Turks Son stark dead: for which cause, by treason were
their lives conspired, and the following night, had their Lodging entered by
twelve of the Turks Guard, with an intent to murder them: but by reason of
the inchaunted Ring, in the which they put both their little fingers, the Guard
of a sudden fell all fast in a trance: hereupon the two Knights departed the
Turkish Court, But no sooner were they out of the City, but a troop of armed
Knights pursued them, and followed them so nearly, that they were forced to
enter a Castle that stood by the Sea side, wherein no creature had abiding:
coming to the Gate, the Fayerie Knight with his Sword struck thereat, an it
presently opened: wherein being no sooner entered, but the armed Knights of the
Turkish nation closed them fast in, and caused the Gates to be walled up with
Free Stone, and so departed. Now were these two Knights in more danger of
death, then ever they had been in all their lives: and sure they had starued,
had not good policy preserved their lives: for the Castle walls were so
high, that none durst venture down without great danger. As in greatest
extremity, man's wit is the quickest for invention; so the two Knights cut off
all the Hair from their heads which were very long) and therewithal made
along ^oo^sted Line or Cord, with the which they slid from the top of the Wall
to the Ground. But this mischaunce happened; as the Fayerie Knight glyded down,
the Coard broke, and his body took such a violent blow against the stony
Ground, that it struck the breath quite out of his body, no life by the Black
Knight could be perceived, but that his soul was for ever divided. This of
all misfortunes, was held the extremest; therefore in great grief he
breathed forth this lamentation.

Oh you partial Fates (quoth he) Oh you unjust Destinies: Why have you reft
two lives by wounding one? Now let the Sun forbear his wonted light. Let
Heat and Could, let Drought and Moisture, let Earth and Air, let Fire and
Water, be all mingled and confounded together: let that old confused Chaos
return again, and here let the World end. And now you Heavens this is my
request, that my Soul may presently forsake this flesh: I have no soul of
mine own, for it is the soul of the Fayerie Knight, for but one Soul is
common to us both: then how can I live, having my Soul departed, which
spightfull death has now separated? Oh thou my Knightly brother, though the
Fates deny to give thee life, yet in spite of them I Will follow thee. You
Heavens receive this half soul of my true Friend and let not life and death
part us; with Eagles wings will I fly after him, and in Jove's cele^^iall
Throane join with him in friendship. We two in life were but one; one will,
one heart, one mind, one Soul made us one: one life kept us both alive, one
being dead, draws the other unto death: therefore, as we lived in love, so
will we dye in love; and with one Grave we may interre both our bodies: How
glorious and happy were my death, to dye with my beloved friend: Now do I
loath this life, in living alone without my dear Brother: whereupon drawing
his Sword from his side, he said.

Oh thou woeful Weapon, even thou shall be the mean, to rid my soul from
this prison of body. Oh faith unfeigned; Oh hand of sacred friendship: I am
resolved both with the force of Heart, Hand, and Arms, to give my Heart deaths
deadly wound; for now my noble Fayerie Knight, this blood I offer up unto thy
Soul. But being ready with his Sword to pierce his own heart, he saw a
lively blood spread in his friends face, and those eyes that were so dolefully
closed up, began now to look abroad; and the countenance that was so pale and
wan, received a fresh complexion: whereupon the Black Knight stayed from his
desperate resolution, and from a bloody tragedian, became the recouerer of his
brothers life; who after a while, began to be perfect sencible: so binding his
bruzed bones together, they went a Shipboard on a Ship that lay at anchor at
the next Port, making for England, so the next morning (the wind served well)
the Pilots hoysted sail, merrily floting on the waters.

Ten weeks had not passed toward the finishing of a year, before they arrived
on the Chaulkie cliftes of England; upon which they had no sooner set footing,
but with their warm lips they gently kissed the cold earth, This is the Land
of promised glory (said the Fayerie Knight) to find this Land I have endured
many miseries: to find this Land I have passed many Countries, and in this
Land, must I seal up the last quittance of my life, here shall my bones rest,
for I am lawfully descended from the loins of an English Knight: peace be in
my end, for all my days have been spent in much trouble.

In such like discourses left they the shore side, and trauayling further into
the Land, they met with one of King Arthurs Knights, named Sir Launcelat
Dulake, so old and lame that through his bruises in chiualry, he seemed rather
an impotent creature, then a Knight at Arms; yet at the sight of these two
aduenturous Knights, his blood seemed to grow young: and he that before, could
not march a mile on foot for a Kingdom, now went as tiuely as any of the two
other Knights did. First came they to London, where for their fathers sake,
they were (by the Governors) most gallantly entertained: the streets were hung
round with Arras hangings, and Tape, strie works: Pagiants were builded up in
every street, the Cond^nts ran with Wine, and a solemn Holy Day was then
proclaimed to be kept yearly upon that day. To speak of Banquets prepared for
them, the Tilts and Tournaments, and such honorable graces, I think needless.
In London in great content stayed they some twenty days: in which time came
noble messengers from the Court to conduct them to the King that then reigned:
for since the Black Knight and his mother departed the Land, happened three
changes, every one maintaining the ancient honor of King Arthurs Knights of
the Round Table, whereof these two in presence of all the Nobility, were in
Knightly sort created.

After this, the King ordained a solemn Iusting to be kept in his Court, and
held in great honor for forty days: to which Knightly sports, resorted the
chiefest flowers of Chivalry from all Countries, as Kings, Princes, Dukes,
Marquesses, ^arles, Lords, and Knights; and for chief Challenger and Champion
for the Country, was the Fayerie Knight: who for his matchless manhood
therein shown, had this title given him by a general consent, to be called,
The Worlds Wonder.

After this, being desirous to see the City of Lincoln, where the Red-rose
Knight was borne, he in company of his Brother and true friend, the Black
Knight, and old sit Lancelat Dulake, rod thither, at whose coming into the
City, the great Bell (called Tom a Lincoln) was rung an hour, which as then
was seldom shown to any, excepting Kings, and renowned warriors, returning
victoriously from bloody ^attles. Here builded they a most sumptuous Minster,
which to this day remains in great magnificence and glory. Likewise here
builded they a most stately Tomb in remembrance of their Parents: the like (as
then) no place of England afforded.

Thus having left the noble feats of Chiualry, they lived a life zealous, and
most pleasing to God: erecting many Almshouses for poor people, giving thereto
great Wealth and Treasure: And when nature ended their days, they were buried
in the same Minster, both in one Tomb: which likewise was so richly set up
with Pillars of Gold, that above all other Cities, it grew the most famous:
whereupon since that time, has this old Proverb of three Cities gr^wn common,
which is used in these words: Lincoln was, London is, and York shall be.

FINIS.
