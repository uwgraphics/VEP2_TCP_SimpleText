Hereunto are adjoined, sundry pretty practices and conclusions of Cookerie:

At London, Printed by Edward Alde, for Edward White, 1588.

To the Courteous Reader,
THis Pamphlet being written (not many years past as it should seem) at the
earneste request and suite of a Gentle woman in the Cuntrye for her private
use, which by these singular practices has obtained such fame, that her name
shall be remembered for ever to the posterity. The original Copy (by great
chance) was lent me by an especial freende of mine, in the perusing whereof I
found it so furnished with such rare experiments and pritie conceits as the
like are not to my knowledge extant in the English tung. I thought it my duty
for the health and pleasure of many my friends, to set them forth to the veiwe
of the world, to be practiced especially of those that take delight in such
matter, or has any occasion through their defectes to use them for their
healthes sake. This I dare presume to report of the work, that there are
herein included very many secrets, that I know by the Widows own practice,
to be most singular and approved, and though perhapes they are not orderly set
down as many of better skill might have done, I desire you to consider that
this was of the collectione of such a one as never once thought to have made
the^ common: but only to his good friend M*R. This caveat she also gives by
the way, to read them advisedly and practice with discretion, and as you
find commend: and so wi^h all humility concluding, I dedicate unto you this
her Treasure and chief Jewel: desiring you to be a defense as well for her as
for me, from all such as shall in your hearing scorn her, or me for
disclosinge such profitable experimentes.

Fareyou well.
