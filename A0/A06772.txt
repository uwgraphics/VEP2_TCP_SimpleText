honger newlye made for the comfort of poor nedye Christians, by Thomas Becon.

David. P^al. xxxvii. I Have been young, and am old, and yet saw I never y^
rightous forsaken, nor his children beggyng their bread. The ryghtuous is
ever merciful and lends, and yet shall his children have Godds plenty and
enough*

Solomon ^^^ouer.xxx. Two things have I required of the, O Lord, that thou
wylt not deny me before I dye. Remove from vanytye and lies. Give me nether
pouerte nor riches, only grant me a necessary living, least if I be to full,
I deny the and say: who is the Lord? and least I being constrained through
poverty faul unto stealing, and forswere the name of my God.

Christ. Math. vi. Take no thought, saying, what shall we eat, or what shall we
drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed? after al these things seek the Hethe^.
For your heavenly father knows, that ye have need of all these things. But
seek ye first the kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof and al these
things shall be cast unto you.

To the right worshipful Sir Ihon Robsarte knight, Thomas Becon wysheth
continual health both of body and mind from God the father in Christ Jesus our
Lord.
SO often as I behold the wretchid and to much miserable face of this needye and
beggerl^ world, yea so often as I consider the lamentable and pytifull, state of
the poor people, which are now grown unto such a number, that they be
almost innumerable, and so assailed with the cruel darts of poverty and
honger, that they in a manner despair of necessary food and convenient apparel
for the sustentation of their poor wretched karcasses, and by this means for
a redress of these their to manyfolde miseryes part of them, whose brains
are not perfectly settled, whose judgments are not thoroughly stayed in the way
of perfect reason, not patiently bearing the cross of pouertye, contrary to
Christen order and their bounden duty attempt unto the great doloure of al
good men, ungodly and unlawful enterprises, as wicked councels, unjust
assembles, abominable sedicio^s, diuilyshe insurreccions, detestable
conmocions, unrighteous spoylynges of other men's goods, uncharitable
raylynges upon their superiors. Deuteronomy. xxviii, ii. Reg. xvii. Ie^^m. xviii.
Eze^h. iiii. v. iiii. x^ix. xxxii ^xxiii. ^se. ii.
etc. Utterly defacynge, somuche as in them is, the face of the common weal,
not consyderyng this plage of famyn and honger to be sent into the world for
sin according to the ^hreatnynges of God expressed in y^ holy scriptures: I
can none otherwise the^ lament and heartily wysh better and more prosperous
things to the nedy and poor creatures of god universally. For although
according to the common Proverb, Common pro^rbes.


Lyt^el wo^e the full sow that is in y^ s^ye, What the hungrye sow ayleth, that
goes by.

Yet so many as are of God, and led with any natural or human affeccion,
they remember this old saying:

It is merry in hell, When berdes wag al, and can not even in the mids of their
wealth, but repent the mysery of the miserable, the poverty of the poor, the
famyn of the famished, The nature of Charity. romay. xii.
and to y^ uttermost of their power study to re^eue the dystresse of the nedy
both with their goods and council. As a true Christian man ioyeth with them that
are glad, even so soroweth he with them that are sad. Charity seeks not her
own, but both wishes and does well to al men, ^. Corin. xiii
even to her enemies. Charytye puts on the propertye of Christ, which became
poor to make other rich. Charytye ioyeth not at her own joy, ii. Corin. viii
if other sorrow. Charity delyteth not in her own fulness, if other want.
Charity abhors her own reaste if other be disquieted. I am combred daily,
says S. Paul, ii. Corin. xii
and do care for all congregacions. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is
offended, and I am not grieved? Yea Charity refuses almost to be saved, if
other enjoy not the like benefyt. Did not that most excellent prophet Moses
desire God either to forgive the children of Israel their sins Exodi. xxxii.
or else to wy^e him out of y^ book of life? romayne^ ix


Did not blessed Paul wyshe to be accursed from God so that the Israelites his
kynsmen after the flesh, might be saved? Acts. vii.
Did not the glorious Martyr Stephen according to the example of Christ pray
for his enemyts? So wholly does Charity give her self to serve the health and
wealth of other. Luke. xx^^


And as touching the relyefe of the poor and nedy, oppressed with the wa^^ of
worldly things, what good and godly man has not at al times, as occasion and
habylitie has served, sought it? Who being godly minded seeing his Christen
brother or sister in necessity, seeks not al means possible to healye them?
Can a Christian abou^d in worldly wealth and suffer his neighbor to famyshe or
to dye for cold? He has not put on the bowels and render compassion of
Christ, which is not moved with pity toward his nedy neighbor? Hospitality.
O what goodli and notable examples does y^ holy scripture mynyster unto us of
socourynge the socourles? What a myrrou^e to behold is that most reverend
Patriarch Abraham the father of the faithful, Gene. xviii.
unto the faithful? With what alacrity and cherefulnes of mind did he
receive into his house the Angels of God being in men's likeness? With what
diligence prepared he al things necessary for them, as he thought, weary
bodies? When Loath saw the two angels of God, whom he judged to be men, coming
into Sodom at night* how reuere^^ly did he behave him self toward the^, and
instantly desired the^ to come into his house and there lodged y^ night? Gene.
xix.
I beseech you syrs, says he, turn into the house of your servant, and abide
there. Wash your feet, and in the morning ye shall go forth on your journey.
And afterward he made them a feast, says the Scripture. These two godly
ancient fathers thought is not mete to suffer strangers and way farynge men
to pass foreby their houses without relyefe. They did according to Gods holy
will expressed by the prophet, saying. Break thy bread to the hungry^, Esaias.
^viii.
and led the nedye and the way faring into thy house. When thou see a naked
man, cover him, so shall thou not despise thy flesh. Forget not hospitalite,
says S. Paul, for by it, certain vnwars have received angels into their
houses. Hebrews. xii*
How ready pacient Job was to socour y^ socourles, and to relyue the nedy, it
is evident by these his words: When the poor desired any thing of me, Job.
xxxi.
have I denied it them? Have I caused the widow to stand waityng for me in
vain? Have I eaten my porcio^ alone that the fatherles has had no part
with me?

For mercy grew up with me fro my youth, and compassion from my mothers
womb. Have I seen any man peryshe through nakedness and want of clothyng? Or
any poor man for lack of raiment, whose sides thanked me not because be was
warmed with the wol of my sheep? Again he says, I have not suffered a
stranger to lie without, but I opened my doors unto him, that went by the way.
As I may pass over many other examples, contay^ed in the old Testamente,
which declare how merciful diverse godly both men and women were toward
strangers and poor people, Mark. viii.
how tender hearted and full of most loving pity and unfeigned compassion, did
our Savior Christ show him self when he fed so many people with seven
loaves and a few small fyshes? I am inwardelye moved with compassyon toward y^
people, says he, because they have now been with me.iii. days, and have
nothing to eat, and if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they
shall faint by the way. Moreover, as I may let pass diverse other miracles,
which he did for the relief of y^ poor, as turnyng water into wine at the
marriage in Caua Galile, Joan. ii. ^oan. vi.
and feeding five thousand with five barley loa^es and two fishes, did he not
show him self to take great care for the poor, when he gave the rich men
this commandment? When thou make a ^ynner or supper, Luke. xiiii.
cast not thy friends, (...) thy brethren, neither thy kynsmen, nor thy rich
neighbors, least they also bid the again, and a recompense be made the. But
when thou make a feast call the poor, the feeble, the lame, and the blind,
and thou shall be happy, for they cannot recompense the. But thou shall be
recompensed at the resurreccion of the just men. Math xxv.
In the descripcion of the general Judgment, which shall be at the last day,
is not the reward of everlasting life ser forth to the merciful, Jacob. ii.
Math v.
and eternal damnacion to the merciles? The Judgment, says S. James, shall be
without mercy, to the^ that has showed no mercy. Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy. Luke. x^.
Give alms of that ye have, and behold al things are clean unto you, says
our Savior Christ. Luke. xvi.
Was not the rytche glo^to^ damned, because he was led with no piety toward
the poor?

O how diligent were the Apostles after Christ's ascencion to appoint Deacons
to mynyster unto the poor, Acts. vi. xi.
and to provide that they lack nothing? A^tes. xxiiii
How earnest was blessed Paul in exortynge the Christians to make colleccions
for the poor? ^oma. xv.
Yea how wroughte he with his own hands, i. Corin. xv
that he might have whereof to give unto the nedye? ii^ Cor. viii.
What a friendly lesson in ye poor peoples behalf writes he unto Bishop
Timothe to be declared unto the rich worldlynges? Acts. xx.
Command them that are rych (says he) in this world, ii. These. iii
that they be not hie minded, i. Timo. v^.
nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, which gives us
abundantly al things to enjoy the^, that they do good works, that they be
ready to give, and glad to dystrybute, layinge up in store for them self a
good foundation against the time to come, that they may obtain eternallife.
How is Dorcas a noble and virtuous woman commended in the holy Scripture? She
was full of good works and alms deeds, says blessed Luke, (...). ix.
Yea she with her own hands made coats and garments for the poor. ^irrours
(...) Gentle, (...).
An example worthi to be followed of our Gentle women and Ladies now a days,
which in tyringe and garnishynge the^ selves know neither measure nor end, but
of preparynge garments for the poor, they for the most part do not somuche
as once dream. Dorcas could not abide, that she herself should have a rich
waredroppe full of sumtuous apparel, and se her Christen Brethren and systern
go naked and dye for cold, Yea rather then they should want, she will set her
own hands to work, which thing many of our fine whight fingred Gentyl
women, yea and some inferioure to them dysdayne to do.

How instantly did a certain woman named L^dia desire. ^etes. xvi.
S. Paul and his compa^ions to come into her house, and there to have all
things necessary for them? ^reachers vn^rouided.
If ye think (says she) that I believe on the Lord, come into my house, and
abide there. Would God the like affeccion toward the Preache^s of Gods word
were found in our^ men and women at this present, then should not so many
of them be oppressed with poverty, and wander abroad without lyuinges as they
do now, unto the great sclau^der of y^ Gospel, which they preach. Is it not a
shame that they should want temporal things, which minister unto us spiritual
and heavenly things? i Corin. ix.
Has not the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel, should live
of the Gospel? Are not they that rule well, and labor in word and doctrine,
worthy of double honor? Is it not convenient, that the housbandeman which
labors, should first take of the fruits? i. Timo. v.
Are we not forbidden to mosel the mouth of the o^e that treads out the
corn? ii. Timo. ii.
Is not a reward ordained for the workman? i. Timo. v.
If we have sown among you spiritual Math x.
things, i. Corin. ix.
is it a great matter, if we reap your carnal things? Do ye not know that
they, which minister about holy things, Math. x.
live of the sacrifyce? they which wait of the temple, are partakers of the
temple. Even so also did the Lord ordain, i. Timo. iii. Titus. i.
that they which preach the Gospel, should live of y^ gospel, says S. Paul.
The Apostle requires that a Bishop, y^ is, a spiritual minister should
mayntaine hospitality. How unseemly the^ is it for the^ that should feed other,
Papists h^ to fore bet^ provided ^o the^ preaches now.
either myserably to live on other men's tre^chers, or else like vagaboundes to
hunt about for their lyuinge? Neither our au^cestours nor we in times paste
have so dealt with y^ sorcererlyke Sacryfycers, with y^ prat^yng Papists, with the
monstrous Monckes, with the chatrerynge Channons, with the flattering f^yers,
and such other mumryshe mummers, as under the vysar of painted holiness have
deceived almost all the world, ledynge us from Gods blessed word to man's
tryfle inge^radicions, from the way of salvation unto the state of damnacion,
from heaven to hell, from God to the dyuyl. But so has it ever gone for y^
most part with the true Preachers in this wicked and unthankful world. In
the time of king Achab, the true Prophets of God were slain, and the^ that
remained alive, were secre^lye kept in caves and there fed with bread and
water of good Abdy^, which unfeignedly feared God. (...). xviii.
If they had not been preserved by that godly man, they had either been
slain, or else famished. But the Preistes of Baal abounded with all kind of
wealth. Eight hundred and fy^ty, says the scripture, did eat of Iesabels
table.

Who knows not, ^remie. xx. ^viii.
that the Prophet Hieremie was thrown into pryso^, cruelly entreated and like
to dye for ho^ger, when ^hashur. the priests, and such other false prophe^es
even men pleasars, ^ath. xii.
lived in all wealth and abundance of worldly things? With what poverty the
disciples of Christ were grieved, ^athe. viii. (...).
it may easly be known, when they for very honger were compelled to pluck y^
ears of corn and to eat. Joan. xviii. zachary. ^x. Math. xxi.
And how poor Christ was, not a few places of the Scripture do declare, when
in ye mean time Annas, Caiphas, Alexander, ye Scribes, ye Pharisees, Lawers, ye
Bishops, the Priests, y^ sacrificers with al ye rabble of Hipocrites lived in all
pomp and pleasure. This in gratitude, churlishnes and illiberalitie toward y^
ministers of gods word shall not escape unpunished. Luke. x
He y^ despyseth you, despises me, says Christ, and he that despises me,
despises him yt sent me. Luke. x.
But let us return unto our matter. Luke. xix.


What need I rehearse, Acts. ix.
Martha, Zache, Simon the tanner, Acts. xvii.
Jason. Aquila, Philip the Evangelist, Act. ^xi. xxv^^
Publius, Philemon, Gaius, Galath. vi.
and such other, which all showed the^ selves courteous, ge^tyl and
beneficial toward al ye poor, but chefly toward the^ yt were of y^ household of
faith, as s. Paul warns. If we have recourse unto ancient histories, O how
shall we learn of the^ the fatherly pytie and Godly glad affeccio^, O factum
been.
which was in ye Bishops and Deacons toward the poor people when Christ's
church began to florishe. Read we not, that for the comfort of the poor and
oppressed Christians, the godly ancient Bishops did not only sell the
Ornaments, Treasures, and Iewelles of the church, but also the very boxes of
Gold and Silver, wherein the Lords brea^, which we commonly call y^ Sacrament
of the altar, (...) or our By^oppes.
was kept? they had rather keep the Sacrament of Christ's body in a basket of
wyckers, and to fell that they made of gold for the releife of the pore, then
they should want. O godly Bishops and faithful sheppardes, which so
diligently watched for the preservation of their sheep both bodily and ghostly.
Is it not to be thought, that the su^mes of money, which the beneficed me^
yerelye pay to the archedecon of every dioceise, were first of all freely
granted and given of our predecessoures to be distributed among the pore
people of that diocease, as necessity required, and their descrecion served?
But how that money is now abused, who sees not? the office of the
archedecon, The of^yce of (...) Archdeco^.
is yearly to visit eueri paryshe in the diocese, where he dwells, and
diligently to se, what y^ pore people of every paryshe want, and to make
provision for them, and unto that use, as I said before, was that money given,
which every beneficed man pays to the archedeco^ again, to se whither parson
or vicar be resident upon his benefice, and mainetaine such hospytalite, as y^
pore of y^ parish be y^ better for it. But now a days y^ archdco^s ask not
for y^ pore, nor in what co^dicio^ they stand, but whether y^ hosts be well kept
in y^ pyxe from moulding and furring, whither corpraise clothes be clean
washed, whither the Chrismatory besafely locked up, whyther the Priest uses
any unhallowed garments or chalyce in his sacrifisynge, whyther y^ copes,
vestme^tes and albes be sufficiently repaired, whither the Church, Chau^cel, or
Church yard be in case good enough, and such other trifles. God have mercion
us, and se^d us once a redress of these things. Furthermore with what a Godly
pity and charitable affeccio^ did our ancestors burn toward y^ poor
members of Christ, Follow these fore fathers.
which as I may speak nothing of Abbeyes, Colleges, Chau^tries, frechapels.
etc. bilt with their great cost hospitals and such other houses, enduing the
same with yearly revenues for the relife of y^ poor? Men^rie, fathers, fathers,
but the manners of these fathers are clean forgotten. Philip. ii.
All seek their own auau^tage, and not those things which pertain unto Jesus
Christ. Thus se we y^ al good me^ have ever pityed the poor, and sought al
means possible to do the^ good. But the contrary is found among us now a
days. ii. Timo. iii.
For me^ according to s. Paul's prophecy, are the lovers of them selves and not
of the poor. They are covetous to themselves, and not liberal to y^ poor They
heap to themselves, they provide nothing for the poor, there be many signs of
y^ last day to be at hand, but this cold affeccio^, and more cold love, and
most cold lyberalitie toward y^ poor prove evidently y^ it is not far of.
Among mani other signs and tokens, which Christ declares to go before the day
of Judgment, Math. xxiiii.
is not this one of the most evident? For as much, says he, as iniquity shall
abound, the love of many shall wax cold. When did iniquity ever so abound?
when was y^ love of men ever so cold toward the poor? The rich worldelynges
in times paste could build great monasteries for the bellyed Hypocrites, Note.
great Colleges, Chauntries, and Freechappels, for subtle cariars and
Purgatory rakers, but who build somuche as a cotage now for to harbor a
sely poor man? Men in times past disherered their lawful heirs to nouryshe in
ydlenes a number of idle bellies under the pretense of prayer, but who now eue^
of his superfluities does any notable thing for Christ's poor members? A
number of people heretofore has decked Idols and mawmets, with silk, vel^et,
and other precious veslures yea with gold, silver, pearl, and precious stones,
how many now in so great a multitude do cloth y^ poor naked creatures of God
with canuis and rugge? They gave shoes of silver and gold set with rych stones
to dome mawmets, but who now gives shoes of leather to y^ poor? O to^uche
vnmercyfulnes. Can these things escape vnplaged? If the Lord lives, plages
be at hand, except we amend. This our ingratytude toward God, and
unmercifulness toward the poor, will surely accelerate and haste forward the
vengeauns of God to fall upon us. For whether we respect and behold the
spirituality or temporalty, their love toward the poor compared with the love
of our Au^cestoures, is very cold, yea it is almost nothing. But if we compare
their coue^uousnes with the desire of our Elders toward the goods of the
world, Spiritual me^ couetou^
we shall find it so far to excel and surmount, as the hie heavens do the
low earth. How do many of our spiritual men, as they are called, heap
promocion upon promocion, benefyce upon benefyce, deanrye upon deanrie, prebend
upon prebend, and prebe^d for auau^tage? Ah, one ^ylthy belly to devour so
many wealthy lyuinges? O abominacio^. And yet the careless swyne are led with
no pity toward the poor, whose sweat of their brows they lyk up, whose
labors of their hands they cormorantlyke devour. Behold their pain in
teaching, it is very small, behold their hospitality, it is nothing at all.
Woo be unto these shepherdes, says God by the Prophet, that feed themselves.
Should not y^ shepeherdes feed the flocks? Ezech. xxxi^^
Ye have eaten up the fat, ye have clothed you with y^ wol, the best fed have
ye slain, but the flock have ye not nourished. The weak have ye not holde^
up, y^ sick have ye not hea^^d the broken have ye not bound together, y^
outcasts have ye nor brought again, the lost have ye not sought, but
churlishly and cruelly have ye ruled them. Temporal (...) covetous.
Agay^e how do many of the temporal worldlinges join ferme to ferme, office to
office, lordshyp to lordshyp, pasture to pasture, land to land, house to house,
and house for advantage? that the vengeance of God threatened by the Prophets
may come upon the^. ^saye v.
Woe be unto you, y^ join house to house, and couple land to land, so nyghe
one to another, that y^ poor man can get no more ground. Shall ye dwell alone
upon the face of the earth? These things are come up unto my ears, says y^
Lord of hosts. Shall not many great and gorgious houses be so waste that no man
shall dwell in the^? ^ab a^uk. ii.
Again, woe be unto him, y^ heapeth up other men's goods. How long will he lade
him self with the thycke clay? Woe be unto him, y^ couetously gathers evil
gotten goods into his house, that he may set his nest on hye, to escape from
the power of misfortune. Thou have devised y^ shame of thine own house. The
very stones of the wall, shall cry out of it. O how does our savior Christ
thunder against y^ rich worldlings, y^ live al in pleasure, and yet are not
once moved with pytie and co^passio^ toward y^ pore? (...). vi.
Woe be to you, y^ ar rich (says he) which have your co^solacio^. Woe be to y^u
y^ are filled, for ye shall ho^ger. Woe be to you y^ laugh now, for ye shall
mourn and weep. Thus se we what unmercifulness reigns in the world almost
universally. And how all the threatninges of Gods ve^geau^ce can not quench in
y^ wicked worldlynges hearts y^ insaciable thyrst of gathering worldly gooddes,
but that they go still for the to heap up thycke claye against themselves, yea
and that beyond al measure, not consideringe how vain and deceatful y^
possession of temporal things is in this world. He heapeth treasure upon
treasure, Psalm. xxxi^.
says David, and yet knows he not for who^ he gathers these things to
gether. Notable is the histori y^ our savior Christ tells of a certain rich
man in y^ Gospel of. Luke. xii.
s. Luke The grownd of a certain rich man, says he, brought forth ple^tyfull
fruits, and he thought win him self, saying: what shall I do, because I have no
room, where to bestow my fruits? And he said, thus will I do. I will destroy my
barnes, and build greater, and the^ will I gather al my gooddes y^ are growe^
unto me, and I will say to my soul, O soul y^ have much goods laid up in store
for mani years, take thine eas^ eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto
him, y^ fool, this night will they fetch away thy soul again from the. The^
whose shall those things be, which y^ have provided? So is it with him y^ gathreth
riches to him self, and is not rich toward god. What the^ remains, but y^
they which are godl^ri^h, remember themselves to be y^ stewardes of God, endued
with worldly substance, not to spend it voluptuously or after their own
folyshe fansye about trifles, but upon their necessaryes, and that they may
conuenie^tly spare, to distribute unto the poor, which are their brothers in
Christ of the same flesh and blood, and fellow enheritours with them of one
and of the same glory. O blessed is the rich, which is found without
blemyshe, and has not gone after gold, nor hoped in money and treasures.
Eccle. xxxi.
Where is there such a one, and we shall commend him, and call him blessed. For
great things does he among his people. And that the Godly rich may be the
more encouraged to gratify the poor and to do good unto the nedye in this
wretched and begerlye time, let the^ ever set these and such like se^tences of
the holy scriptures before the eyes of Sentences for ^he Godly ^yche to
reme^^er.
their mind. My son defraude not the poor of his alms, and turn not away
thine eyes from him that has need. Despise not an hongry soul, and despise
not y^ poor in his necessity. Grieve not the heart of him that is he
alpelesse, and wythdrawe not the gift from the nedeful. Refuse not y^ prayer of
one y^ is in trouble turn not away thy face from the nedye. Eccle. iiii.
Cast not thine eyes aside from y^ poor for any evil will, yt thou give him
noue occasion to speak evil of the. For if he complain of the in ye bytternes
of his soul his prayer shall be herd, eue^ he that made him, shall hear him. Be
courteous unto the company of ye poor, humble thy soul unto the elder, and
bow down thy head to a man of worship. Let it not grieve the to bow down
thine ear unto ye poor, but pay thy debte, and give him a fre^dli answer,
and that with mekenes. Deliver him that suffers wrong from ye hand of ye
oppressor, and be not faint hearted, when thou fyghtest in judgment. Be
merciful unto the fatherles as a father, and be in stead of an husband unto
their mother, so shall thou be as an obediente son of the hiest, and he shall
love the more then thy mother does. Help the poor for ye commandments
sake, and let him not go empty from the, because of his necessity. Lose thy
money for thy brother and neighbors sake, Eccle. xxix.
and bury it not under a stone where it rusteth and corrupti^h. Gather thy
treasure after the commandment of the highest, and so shall it bring the more
profitte the^ gold. Lay up thy alms in the hand of the poor, and it shall
keep the from al yuyl. A man's alms is a purse with him, and shall keep a ma^s
favor as y^ aple of an eye, and afterward shall it arise and pay every man his
reward upon his head. It shall fight for the against thine enemies better the^
ye shyld of a Giaunt, or spear of y^ mighty. Eccle. xxxv.
Who so is merciful and gives alms, that is the right thank offeringe. Look
what thine hand is able, give with a chereful eye. For y^ Lord reco^pe^ceth and
gives the seven times as much again. ^o^i. iiii.
Give alms of thy goods, and turn never thy face from the poor, and so shall
it come to pass, y^ the face of yt Lord shall not be turned away from the. Be
merciful after thy power. If y^ have much, give ple^^eously, if y^ have little,
do thy diligence gladlye to give of yt little. For so gatherest you thy self a
good reward in ye day of necessity. ^or mercy delyuereth from al syn and from
death, and suffers not ye soul to come in darkness. A great comfort is merci
before ye high god unto al the^ that show it. Eat thy bread with the ho^gry and
poor, and cover y^ naked with thy clothes. ^rouer. xi.
He yt is mercyful, does him self a benefit, but whosoever hurts his neighbor,

y^ people, but blessinge shall light upon his head, ^rou^r. xiiii.
yt gives food. Whosoever despyseeh his neighbor, does amiss, but blessed is he
yt has piti of y^ poor. He that does a poor man wrong, blasphemeth his
maker, ^rouer. xix.
but who so has pity of y^ poor does honor unto God. He y^ has piti upon y^
pore, le^deth unto y^ Lord, ^rou. x^ii.
and look what he lays out it shall be paid him again. He yt is bent unto
mercy, shall be blessed, for he gives of his bread unto y^ poor. He y^ gives

shall suffer great poverty him self. Psalm. x^i.
Blessed is he yt co^sidereth y^ poor and nedy, the Lord shall deliver him in
y^ time of trouble, y^ Lord shall preserve him and keep him, and make him

Lay not up for your selves treasure upon earth, where the rust and moth does
corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. But lay up for you
treasures in heaven, where nether rust nor moth does corrupt, and where thieves do

treasure in heaven.

While we have time, let us do good unto al me^, but chiefly unto them, which

My babes let us not love in word neither in tongue, but in work and truth.

Again yt the ungodly rych may learn somewhat to bridle their covetous affects

There is nothing worse then a couetouse man. Why art thou proud, o thou
earth and ashes? there is not a more wicked thing the^ to love money. And whi?
such one has his soul to sell, yet is he but filthi doung while he lives. He
yt loves riches, shall not be justified, Eccles. xxxi.
and who so follows corruption, shall have enough thereof. Many one are come in

He that trusts in his riches, shall have a faull, but ye righteous shall
floryshe as the grieve leaf, take not over great travail and labor to be
rich, Prouer. xxi
beware of such a purpose. Whi will thou set thine eye upon the thing which
suddenly vanysheth away? for riches make the^ selves wings, and take their
flight like an Eagell into the air. He that gives unto y^ poor, Prou. xxvi
shall not lack, but he yt turns away his eyes from such as are in necessity,
shall suffer great poverty him self. The bread of y^ nedy is ye life of ye
poor he that defraudeth him of it, Eccle. xxxii
is a ma^s^ayer. He that loves monye, will never be satisfied with money, and
who so delyghteth in riches, shall have no profit thereof. Where as much riches
is, Ecclesi. v.
there are many also that spend the^ away. And what pleasure more has he that
possesses the^, sauinge that he may look upon them, with his eyes? a labouryng
man slepeth swetly whether it be little or much that he eats, but the
abundaunce of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. Ye can not serve God and
Ma^mon, Math. vi.
that is, the worldly riches. Uerylye I say unto you, a rich man shall hardly
enter into y^ kingdom of heaven: ^ath. xix.
and again I say unto you, it is easyer for a gable rope to go through y^ eye
of a nedle, then a rich man to enter into y^ kingdom of God. Woe be to you

Woe be to you that are filled, for ye shall honger. Woe be to you, that laugh

Neither thieves, nor couetouse parsones, nor yet extorcioners shall inherit the

Let not covetousness be once named among you, as it becomes Saints. For this
ye know, that no covetous parson which is a worshypper of Idolles, ^phesians. v.

great riches, if a man be content, with yt be has. For we brought nothing

But when we have food and raiment, we must there with be content: they y^ will
be rytch, fall into temptacion and suates, and into many folyshe and noisome
lusts, which drown men into perdicio^ and destruction, for covetousness of

are moth eaten. Your gold and silver is ca^kred, and y^ ruste of the^ shall be a

and shall eat ye flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together in
your last days. Behold the hire of laborers, which have reaped down your
feldes (which hire is of you kept back by fraud) cries, and ye cries of the^
which have reaped, at entered into y^ ears of y^ lord of hosts. Ye have lived
in pleasure on y^ earth, and ben wanton. Ye have noryshed your hearts as in a
day of flaughter, ye have condemned and killed y^ just, and he has not
resisted you. If both y^ godly and ungodly rich would ^et these se^tences
before y^ eyes of their mind co^tinualli, surely it should go much better with ye
pore people, the^ it does at this present For the^ would not y^ rich me^ so
gredily gripe to the^ selves the goods of this world, nor so niggardli keep
the^ after they have gotten the^, as they do now. The^ would not many ge^tleme^,
as they ar called, so grow out of kind from their name by shewi^g little
ge^tilnes to y^ poor, nether by enhau^cing their fermes, by taking fines, by
receaui^g great incomes, nor yet by putting y^ pore out of their houses, and
sufferynge the teneme^tes to faul down, as they do now, then would not the
rich worldlynges join ferme to fearme, and heave other men out of their
lyuinges, as they do now. Then would not many of our spiritual ministers
like insaciable wolves, get so mani ecclesiastical promocio^s into their
hands, as they do now, but having one living and that sufficient, be
content, and remain upon it, teach their flock, led a good life, and
maynetayne hospitality among their Parysheners, yt the poor of their paryshe
in time of need may have bread, broth, befe and bear, as they say. ^alach.

Bring every rythe into my barn, says the Lord, that there may be mea^e

but while al men, as Saint Paul says seek their own, and not Jesus Christ's,
while al, ^ere. vi. viii.
as ye prophet testifies, eue^ from yt lest to y^ greatest give their minds
to couetousness have no regard to y^ poor and to their commodity, y^ poor
live misserably: y^ pore mutter in corners and grudge against y^ rich ye pore
break ye bond of peace, y^ pore rune hedlong into al kind of myscheif, which
thing we of late have seen unto our great sorrow, trouble and disquietnes, yea
some of y^ pore misers for lack of bodeli sustenau^ce fall to pyckyng, robbing,
stealyng and murdering of other, some kyl, drown, hang them selves, because
they do not presently se how they may be able to feed the^ selves, their
careful wives, their lamentable children, and their altogether wretched family,
wishing rather through desperacio^ desperately to end this their nedy, careful
and weary life, then so to much wretchedly for to live. Oh what good man is not
moved with pytye to hear, se, and know these things? Yea what good man
thinks not him self bound even of duty to healpe unto the redress of these
inconuenie^ces, yea pestilences? they are enemies to God, to man, to y^
country, to ye publyke weal, to our posterity, yea to heaven and earth, which
walowing in all kind of wealth like Eth^ysh Epicures, and living al in pleasure
like effeminat Sardanapalus, and heaping y^ goods of y^ world together as
though they should never hence depart are nothing moved with the miseryes of y^
poor miserable people. Woe be to that gloton, which enfarcing his own stinckyng
and draffesaked belly with all kind of pleasure and deintie dishes, suffers his
pore nedy neighbor to perish for ho^ger. Woe be to yt couerous ca^kred churl,
which so joins house to house and land to land, y^ the poor man knows
not, where to hyde his head, nor how to live. Woe be to that wicked worldling,
which deckinge him self gorgiously with sumtuous apparel, suffers his poor
Christian brother to go naked, and to die for cold. Woe be to that rich ravening
raker, which has raked together ple^ti of worldly goods, and yet is
unmerciful to ye nedi members of Christ. Woe be to y^ benificed man, which
having whereof to cherish y^ pore of his parish, is abse^t from his benifice
nothing caring what becomes of the^, so yt he may live pleasa^tly and
wealthely of y^ sweat of other men's brows. Yea and woe be to al the^, which
being able to healpe y^ need of y^ nedi, and to relife ye misery of the
miserable, refuse to do it. Great is their da^nacio^. But forasmuch as every
man godly affected is by y^ order of charity for his power bound to seek and
further a redress in things y^ are amiss. I for my part considering yt
nothing in this world disquieteth a man more the^ pe^siue care and careful
pe^siuenes for a living (if not tomuch, yet co^uenie^) co^sideryng also how
many inco^modities do chance to a man, yt is co^tinualli vexed with grievous
thought taking for y^ provision of y^ belly, I thought it good to gather
together, as time has suffered, certain se^te^ces and histories of y^ holy
sciptures, which declare and setforth unto us y^ unmeasurable bou^tie and
exceeding large liberaliti of god toward al the^ y^ cast their care on him, and
travail according to their vocacio^ and calling, y^ by reading or hearing of
the^, the weak in faith may wax strong in faith, and be fully persuaded, that
y^ god which nourished the^ in their mothers womb, will not leave the^ now
socourles* when they be able through his grace to cleu unto his promises, to call
upon his name, and for their power endeuout the^ selfs by one honest go^l^
means or other, to get their living, ever casting their care on God, and yet
not being idle, but laboring in their vocacio^ according to gods good will and
pleasure. I doubt not, but if they diligently weigh and earnestly po^der these
comfortable se^tences and histories of y^ holy scripture, they shall not only
cease to attempt any unlawful means, but they also shall find great quietness
procure much reast to their minds, and so long as they live, live with a meri
conscience. If I had been as able to redress y^ miserable state of y^ pore with
worldly goods, as my will is to stay their consciences with the word of God, y^
they may not despair of a living, I would have been as ready to do the one, as I
have labored to do y^ other. But seeing froward fortun goth forward to frown
upon me, and daily cease not to pearse me with y^ cruel darts of pouerti, I
must do yt I may, when I may not yt I would, laughing folish fortun to scorn
with al her vanities, and pleasures, thincking my self sufficie^tli rich, solo^g
as I have such a lord, Romay. x.
as is ple^teously rich for so many as call on him solo^g as through gods grace I
am endued with this faith to believe yt while I travail in my vocacion for my
power according to Gods will, I shall want no good thing, yt is necessary for the
either covering or feding of this my mortal body. And would God al me^ could
so quiet the^ selves, and with Democritus the Philosopher laugh this foolish
world with al y^ voluptuous worldlings to scorn, or with the blessed Apostle even
from y^ very heart say, Galath^. vi.
y^ world is crucified to me, and I to the world. This little treatise after I
had once finished it, I thought mete to dedicate unto your right worshipful
Mastershyp, partly for y^ Godly affeccio^ and Christian zele, which both you and
that good virtuous Lady your wife have borne toward y^ pure religion of God
these many years, partly for y^ good report yt both you have among al good
me^ for your charitable liberality, and plentiful alms toward ye poor
people, unto ye notable example of al rich me^, specially of such as profess
y^ Gospel, Gross Gospellers.
whereof many in these our days, alas for pity, have y^ Gospel swi^ming in*
their lips, and yet in their deeds live no part of ye Gospel, but abuse ye
name thereof to cloak their beastli living and to shadow their carnal liberti,
they the^ selves being ye bond slaves of Satan, further from y^ true faith
the^ the very Turks and Jews, more estraunged from al godly works, both of
fasting, praiyng, geuyng of alms, mortifiyng their carnal affectes. etc.
then the very papists, so cotouse, proud, ha^eful, vain glorious, diss^blyng,
bankeryng, liynge, sclaundering, disdainefull, uncharitable, vnmercif^ll,
wicked, and unclean in conversation, that I know not to whom I may justly
compare them. They profess that they know god, Tit. ^.
as S. Paul says, but with their deeds they utterly deny him, being
abominable, bisobediente, and wholye ^straunged from al good works. What shall
we the^ look for, but (except we repent and emende) eue^ as Christ did
prophecy, Math. xxi.
the kingdom of god shall be taken from us, and given to a nation, which shall
bring forth y^ fruits thereof. He loved not blessing, therefore it shall be far
from him, Psalm. xix.
says David. This unthankfulness toward g^d, this unmercifulness toward our
neighbor, this dissolucio^ of life toward our selves, can by no means escape
unpunished. The Lord have merci upon us, and turn our hertes, (...).
that we may serve him in holiness and righteousness all the days of our life.

God which has begone a good work in you, might continue and finishe the
same unto the glory of his holy name, and the profit of his christen
congregation.

Amen.
The Fortress of the faithful.
Philemon. Christopher. Theophile and Eusebius talk together. Philemon. WHO
soever (most dear brethern) with a single eye beholds the corrupt manners of
this most corrupt world, he shall easly perceive that Satan our old enemy
sleapeth not, but as.s. Peter says walks about like a roaring lion, i. Pe^. v
sekyng who^ he may devour. For if a tree may be known to be fruteful by her
grene leaves, flourishing blossoms and plesaunt fruit, if a workema^ may be
proved by his labors and pains not to be idle, if the sun may be
perceived to shine because of his fyrie and glisteringe beams, surely Satan by
the works that he brings forth in the children of this world, may iustlye be
judged not to be idle, not to sleep, not to slack his office, but to behave
him self in all points like very Satan. For when at any time se^ce ye
beginning of his infernal empier brought he forth so large testimonies of his
deuillishe travails, and showed him self so diligent and painful in procuri^g
things mete for the enlarging of his empier as he does in these out days? Let
our time be compared with any age that has been from the beginning (I speak
eue^ of that age which was most ungodly, most wicked) and it shall more right
well seem to be most godly, most virtuous. For although y^ pride, the
covetousness the whoredo^, the unmercifulness, y^ malice, the ba^ketting, the
building the bieng and sellinge. etc. exercised in ye days of Noe, (...). vii.
(...). xxi^^. ^^ke. xvii.
or at any other time, was without doubt great and abominable, and justly
deserved ye ve^geau^ce of god, as it came to pass, yet compared with the
outragiousnes of vices used in this our time, yea and that so universally and
vnmeasurably, they may be judged but trifles saying the number of the^ compared
with the infinite multitude yt now most wickedly live, is almost nothing. The
pride of these our days is lucifer like, y^ covetousness is insatiable, the
whoredom is monstrous, the unmercifulness is bo^herlike, the malice is
immortal, the ba^ketting is tomuch Epicurelike the building is infinite, the
bying and selling is full of falsehead, craft, and dissimulacio^, and soforth
of other vices, which are alread^ growe^ unto such an exceading height, y^ they
ca^ stretcheout their branches no further, i. Iho. ^.
so yt it is truly said of.s. Iho^, the world is altogether set on wyekednes.
They are corrupt and become abominable in their doings Psalm. ^
there is not one that does good, no not one, says David. The lord looked down
from heaven upon the children of men, to se if there were any yt would
understand and seek after god. But they are al gone out of y^ way, they are
altogether become abominable, there is none yt does good, no not one. And
although every christian heart beholding this most ungodly state of the
world ca^ not but lament and bewail the abhominacions used in these our days,
and right hertelye be sorry, yt the ^ares have so ouergrowe^ y^ good wheat,
that vice does so abound that virtue can take no place, yt sin has so
ouerflowed the whole world, y^ true godli^es is not only neglected and
contemned, but also hissed at and utterly abhorred, yet these traitorous
co^spiracies and hellike co^mocions, ^surreccions (...) co^moci^^, come o^
(...) Devil.
which we of late have seen, wherewith also the comune weal of England has
both been disturbed, defaced, and greatly enpouerished, who except an enemy to
al good order, sorowfully sorow^th not? Who if not an adversary to our
succession with large tears lamenteth not? The inferior members to envy the
principal parts of the body? O unnatural disposicion. The servant to rule
the master, y^ inferior to rise against his soueraign, y^ subject to disobey
his governor? O comberous confusion. The brainsicke, yea rather the brainles
head to attempt redres of matters in a common weal, unsent, uncalled? O
preposterous order.


Christo. It can not de denied but diverse of ye commons have gone far beyond
their limits, and taken in hand that has not become them, for as much as they
contrary to (...) calling have presumed to do the office of magistrates, of
men lawfullye called to rule in the common weal.


Theo. Those their rash and disobedient behavior ca^ by no means please god.


Phil. Please? yea it rather most highli displeases god ^or. xiiii.
which is the author of peace, and not co^fusio^, which will al things to be
done semely and in comeli order, (...). xiii. (...).ii
which commands the subject to obey his superioure in all things, not only
for fear of punishment, but also for conscience sake. How greatly god is and
ever has been offended with disobedience and rebellion, with order breaking and
disturbau^ce of a common weal, y^ holy scriptures sufficiently do show. ^ne.
xiii
Was not Ada^ our gra^dfather thrown out of paradise for his disobedience
toward his lord god, ye most high and most excellent magistrate, and both he
and all we his offspring damned for ever, if we had not ben redeemed by the
preciouse ^it. i.
blood of y^ undefiled lamb Jesus Christ? Thus from the be^inninge se we how
greatly god abhors disobedience, though y^ fault in our eyes seems very
little and not to be passed of.


Euse. Truly therefore is it said of Samuel, ^. Reg. ^v.
behold to obey is better the^ sacrifice, and to harke^ is better the^ the fat
of ra^mes. For rebellion is as ye sin of whordo^, and stubburnes is as ye sin
of idolatry.


Phi. But y^ I may declare to you how god in common weals has ever punished
disobedience, Rebellion p^ged.
rebellion, co^spiracies, insurreccio^s, co^mocions. etc against lawful
magistrates, I pra^ you give ear and mark what shall be said. E^odi. xiii,



Chri. We gladly hear.


Phi Ye know right well, y^ when god determined to deliver his people the
Israelites out of Egypt y^ land of bondage and slavery, he made Moses their
gide and ruler under him.


The. Ye sai trut^


Phi. Here was Moses chosen and appointed of god to be the supreme magistrate
and principal governor of gods people. And as he had here by gods
commandment authority to rule, eue^ so were the Israelites bound by gods
word to obey, which thing so long as they did, they right well prospered, they
lived quietly, god favored them, Moses as a loving father cherished the^. But
when they shoke of the yocke of obedience, sought carnal liberty, murmured
against their magistrate, troubled the common weal, oh how did god punish and
plage the^? The lord has heard your murmurings says Moses, (...)
which ye murmr against him. For what are we (he speaks of him self and
Aaron) your murmuri^ges are not against us, but against the lord. The
Israelites murmuring against Moses, murmured against god, whose officer Moses
was. Therefore says the scripture, behold the countenance of the lord was
moved against the people and the lord five the people with an exceading great
Nume. xi.
plage. Psalm xviii*
And as David says, the heavy wrath of god came upon the^ and slew the
wealthiest of the^, yea and smot down y^ chosen men that were in Israel. For
there is no power, says S. Paul but of god, Romans xiii.
the powers y^ be, are ordained of god. Whosoever therefore resists power,
resists the ordinance of god. But they that resist, shall receive to them
selves da^nacion. Nume xi.
With how grievous and horrible leprosy did god stryke Mir Iam for murmuring
against Moses? How plaged god y^ Israelites for murmuringe Number. xxii.
against him and Moses his servant with fyrie serpents, which stonge them
unto death? Corah, Dathan and Abirom, because they did not obeie Moses gods
magistrate, Number. xvi
but disdained that he should reign over them, although appointed of god, were
they not swalowed up of the earth both they, their wives, their children, and
al their goods? Went not they, and all that they had down alive unto hell, and
the earth closed upon the^, and they perished from among the co^gregacio^?


Chri A mete plage for rebellion.


Phi. On the morrow after when the people of Israel murmured against Moses,
saying: ye have killed the people of the lord, and so irreverently rayled on
him, what, escaped they unpunished? The scripture says, there dyed in that
plage.xiiii.M. and.vii. hundred, besides the^ that dyed about the business of
Corah. Thus se we, that in y^ beginning of the Israelites publyke weal, god
by no means could abide rebels and sedicious persons, but punyshed them with
most horrible and notable plages.


Eus. If god so greuouslye plaged the^ which did but murmr against his
magistrate, how extremely will he punish the^ y^ do not only vn^cuere^tly
speak of the hye powers, Take head ye rebels
but also gather unlawful assembles against them and enarme the^ selves on such
manner, as though they should rise against a common pestilence of the publyke
weal? Surely ye end of such must needs be tomuche miserable.


The. These things were done to show how greatly god approves the office and
dignity of a lawefull Note
magistrate, and that he will be avenged of al such as despise his holy
ordinance, again y^ we by these examples may learn to fear the hye powers,
to honor and obey them, and by no means to resist them, except we will
prove the same or worse plages.


Philemon. Well said. Absalom King Dauides son made an i^surreccion
against his father, and through the counsel of wicked Ahithophel wrought most
vilanie (...) Reg. ^v xvi. ^vii. ^. xviii.
against his fathers honor. What followed? was not Absolo^ miserably slain?
Did not his ungodly counselor hang him self? Were there not also.xx.M. me^
slain in battle, ye took Absoloms part? Se to what point sedicion brings
both the authors, cou^cellors, and mainteiners thereof.


Chri. It is therefore wisdom for all men to follow this council of the wisema^,
my son fear you the lord and the Prou. xxiiii.
king, and keep no company with sedicious persons, for their distruccion shall
come suddenly. And who knows the adversity that may come of them both?
Again wish the king no evil in thy thought, and speak no hurt of the rich
in thy privy chamber, E^cle. x.
for a bird of the air shall betray thy voice, and with h^^ feathers shall
bewraye thy words.


Phil. Who knows not that Seba the son of Bichri, which conspired also
against David and dissuaded the people of Israel ii. Reg. xx
from obedience to their liege soueraign lord, had his head cut of?


Euse. A mete death for a traitor.


Phile. Baasa the son of Ah^a co^spired against Nadab king of Israel, iii.
Reg. ^v.
s^ue him, and reigned in his stead. But what followed? though Baasa in the
sight of the world died no shameful death, yet died he in the displeasure of
god, and afterward al his succession with all his iii. Reg. xvi
fre^des and kinsfolk were al destroyed, so that there was not one left alive.
Again zimri co^spired against Ela king of Israel, slew him, and reigned in
his stead. But shortly after he was driven to such misery and strayte, that he
f^ed into y^ kings palace at Thirza, and settinge it on a fire, brent him
self, and so wretchedlye ended his life.


Theo. An end worthy of such a beginning.


Phil. What shall I rehearse unto you the histories of the.ii. sedicious men,
Theudas and Judas of Galile, ^^tes. v.
of whom blissed Luke writes in his book of the Apostels acts? The one
boasted to do great things, and so allured much people to follow him, the
other councelled the Jews by no means to pay tribute to Caesar, but to
maintain their old liberties, and by this means moved great sedicion among
the people. What became of the^? were they not put to death, and so many as
followed them either s^ayne, or else scatered abroad, and so brought to naught?
We read not in all the scriptures, that any traitor or notable sedicious
parson has at any time escaped without notable punyshmente. God ca^ not
suffer his magistrates to be disobeied, his commonweals to be disturbed, his
polltique or civil laws to be contemned^, his godly and honest orders to be
broken. etc. Who soever attempteth any such wickedness, god will be avenged of
him, as it is evident not only in the holy scriptures, but also in the profane
histories. For god, even among the Heathen cannot abide his ordinance to be
despised.


Chri. Would god that al they which either were authors of sedicion, or
consented thereunto at any time in this our realm, had known these things,
then would not they so greatly have forgotten the^ selves and their duty.


Euse. If they had been as well trained up in learning such godly histories, as
they were ^ouseled in hearing popish masses, and such other trifeling
tru^pery, they had raised up no such tragedies. If there had been but the tenth
part of true and learned preachers, y^ there were of popyshe priests among
them, they had never fallen to such disorder. But it is truly said of the
wiseman, (...). xxvi.
when the preaching of gods word fails, the people run out of order,
perish and come to naught.


The. Yet have I heard it reported that these new preachers, Prechers.
as they call them, through their indiscreet sermons, opened a large window unto
dissolucion of life, and by this means caused the common people to aspire and
breath unto carnal liberty, which while they hunted they forgot both them
selves and their duty.


Phil. I will not excuse al preachers. For some, as I have heard, have taken
upon them the office of preachinge uncalled, vnsente, and such disordered
preachers for the most part, bring all things to a disorder, yea to an
utter confusion, mask they with never so pleasant a visare, and babble with
never so painted eloquence in the syghte and ears of the simple and ignorante
people. How shall they preach except they be sent, Roma. x.
says Saint Paul? I have not sent the preachers, says the Lord, and yet
they run. Iere. xxiii
I have not spoken to them, and yet they preached. But as I may speak in the
faythefull and discrete preachers behalf, which are lawfully sent of the hye
powers, and called thereunto by the secret mocion of gods spirit in their
hertes, how soever they be reported, certain I am they never taught such
doctrine, as should minister occasion to godly people to shake of the zeal of
obedience, or to break any good order or pollityke law.


Chri. Yet have I heard some preachers, whom I know to be both prudent and
faithful, sclaundred, that they by their preaching have caused these vproures.


Philem. Ye said well, sclaundred. Were they preachers or rather massemu^gers,
that caused y^ insurreccions in Deuonshyre?


Chri. Massemungers and papi^tes, as it is reported.


Ph^lem. Then are the godly preachers fre from geuinge any occasion of that
sedicion.


Euse. But what of Norfolk?


Phil. Even in Norfolk also or else where, I am sure the very rebels them
selves will confess, as I have partly heard and known that the preachers were
not the authors nor prouokers of their commocion. Can the sermons of them which
teach al obedience, humility, and pacien^e, move men unto disobedience,
hautines of mind, and desire of reuenginge? Can light be the occasion of
darkness, or truth of salsehead? But what is so prudently, godly, and
circu^spect lie spoken, that envy can not wrest and corrupt? Neither is it
strange for the christian preachers to be misreported of the voluptuous world
lynges and couetouse carles. How earnest a setter forth of gods glory was the
Prophet Elias, and yet how was he reported, not only of the baser sort, but
even of the king and of the Queen? Art thou he, says King Achab, iii. Reg.
that troubles Israel? As though he should say: art thou he which through thine
indiscreet and rash sermons mouest the people to sedicion, make the^
disobedient to me their king and to al my officers, causest them unlawfully to
assemble together, and to make havoc of all things? But y^ Prophet boldly
answered. It is not I that have troubled Israel, but thou and thy fathers
house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord, and followed
the way of Baall, as though he should have answered: Do thou O king, lay
to my charge, yt I troubled thy realm, which teach thy subjects to obey the
in all those thy commandments that fight not with gods word? Then
untruly thou accusest me. There is, I grant, in thy realm sedicion and much
hurlye burly: what then? Impute not the fault to me, but corie thy self on the
head, and say: I my self and my wicked progenitors, which have not te^dered
the glory of god, nor loved to hear his blessed word, nor to maintain ye
preachers thereof, but rather have slain them and followed the way of that foul
Idol Baall, and nouryshed his priests at our own table, and have not ruled
the Realm with such justice and equity, with such clemency and gentleness, as
becomes ryghteous and godly rulers, but have polled and pylled our
subjects, oppressed the widows and fatherless, received brybes, condemned
the gyltelesse for gifts, and shed innocente blood like vnmercyful and
Bochercyke tirauntes, we, we are only the occasion of al these tumultes,
sedicions, conspiracies. etc. wherewith this my Realm at this present is so
greatly dis quieted. As I may let pas the other Prophets, Math. v
which for their godly sermons sustained the like displesure at y^ worldly
tirauntes hands, how was the self master of truth, the wisdom of the father,
I mean Jesus Christ our Lord, ^. Pet. (...)
in whose mouth was found no guyle, no disceate, haudeled for his Sermons?

When they brought him before Pilate, ^e. xxiii.
did not his adversaries and accusers lay to his charge, that he sowed sedicion
among the people? that he corrupted and perverted the commons with his
doctrine, that he forbad men to pay tribute to Caesar, and that he said, he him
self was Christ a king? How unjustly Christ was here accused, the holy
scriptures abundantly testify. How could he be the author of sedicion, (...)
which came in to this world to make peace? How could he corrupt and pervert
the people with his doctrine, when he taught nothing, but that which he had
heard of his father? Can heavenly things corrupt y^ minds of mortal men?
^th. xvii. xxii.
Forbad he to pay tribute to Caesar, which him self paid tribute to Caesar and
commanded other so to do? Boasted he him self a king which ^^ed away from the
people, when they would have made him their king? Iho. vi.
Said he not unto Pilate, my kyngedome is not of this world? Ihon. viii.
Was he disobedient to the temporal rulers, Math. xvii.
which disdayned not to be brought before them, to be judged of the^, yea and
to suffer death under them? ^ctes. vi.
Moreover was not the blessed martyr. S. Steue^ accused y^ he spoke
blasphemouse words against Moses and against god? when of God no man ever
spoke more godly, nor of Moses more reverently. Yet must Steue^ to the pot,
and be condemned for an heritike, when Steven deserved rather praise and
promocion. But Steven had offended inoughe, seeing it was the chief priests
pleasure, and the other ravening rabines, that Steven should live no longer.
Again when.s. Paul and Silas came to Tessalonica, Acts. xvii.
and.S. Paul preached in the sinagoge the passion and r^surreccion of Christ,
how did certain of the Jews complain of them unto the heads of the City,
and rushed into the house of Jason thapostels host, and violentlye plucked him
out, saiynge: These that trouble the world are come hither also, whom Jason
has received priuelie. And these al do contrary to the decrees of Caesar,
affirming another king one Jesus. Here are thapostels accused both of sedicion
and treason, and yet were they neither sedicious persons nor traitors. They
troubled not y^ world, except the world here be taken for the deuelishe people
of y^ world, to who^ it is a trouble to hear any thing of Christ, or to hear
their abominable living rebuked. The good people of the world, they quieted
and made the^ merry in their conscience, ^phe. ii. ^olo. i.
for as much as they persuaded by ye word of god, which thapostels preached, y^
they had gotten fre remis^io^ of al their sins through faith in Christ's blud.
Thapostels did not contrary to the decrees of Caesar, if they were not against
gods word, but rather taught me^ to obei the^. And though they preached
Jesus to be a king, yet did this nothing derogate Cesars honor, for they taught
Christ not to be a temporal, but a spiritual king, not to rule with sweard or
polare, but with his spirit and word, not to reign in Princes palaces, but in
the hertes of the faithful. Is not here great sedicion, great treason? Act.
xxi.
When.s. Paul was but seen at Jerusalem in the temple how cried the jews out,
saying: O ye men of Israel, help: this is the man that teaches al me^ every
where against the people, and ^he law and this place, and violently drue him out
of y^ temple, (...) him, and would have slain him if the hye captain had not
come. What had Paul offended? He spoke nothing, he did nothing, bu^ as other
Jews did. It was enough to kill Paul, because he was that Paul which had
preached Christ to be the son of god. At another time when he told the
Jews, that god appointed him to be a teacher of the Ge^tils, how lifted they
up their voices, saying. Away with such a fellow from the earth, Acts. xx^i.
for it is no reason that he should live. Paul must dye, because at the
commandment of god he turns the Gentiles from Idolatry to the true
worshipping of god. And as the wicked world linges cruelly entreated the
Apostels of Christ, so do the worldly tirauntes handle the good bishops and
faithful ministers in the primitive church. If any myschiefe, plage, or evil
chaunsed in the con^^ey where they were, it was straight ^ay laid to their
charge. Even so ^^kewyse does y^ world at this time ^eal with the true preachers
of y^ lor^es word. Dearth, famine, ho^ger, ^lage, pestilence, battle,
insurrecci^ns, co^mocions, treasons, heresies, Epicurisme, licencious living.
etc. all is imputed to the preachers of Christ's gospel. They, they, and ^one
but they, are the occasion of all that naught is, when no kind of people is
farther from doing harm to a common weal the^ they, neither does a commonweal receive mo benefits of any man, then of the godly preacher. If the old
world had heard and obeyed the sermons of Nohe, they had not perished with
waters. If the Sodomites and gomorianes had harkened to the sermons of Loath,
Gene. vii. ii. Pet. ii.
they had not ben consumed with rain, fire and brymstone from heaven. If the
Israelites had given ear to the warninges of the Prophets Gene. xix.
they had not so often be plaged and led away into captivity. If the jews had
received the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, they and their city with all
their posterity had not come to such a destruccio^. But when the lord rayseth
up his Prophets and preachers, to admonish y^ people of their wickedness, and
to exhort them to repentance, and yet they will not amend, but cruelly
entreat them, s^launder the^ persecute the^, kyl the^, then comes destruction.
The lord god of their fathers, ii. Para. xxxv^.
says the scripture, sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes and
sending, for he had compassion on his people and on his dwellinge place. But
they mocked the messengers of god, and despised his words and misused his
Prophets until the wrath of the lord arose against his people, and till there
was no remedy. And so brought he on them the king of Chaldes, which sieve
their young me^ with the swearde in their holy temple, and spared neither
yongman, maiden, old man, nor him y^ stouped for age.


Chr. The scholar is not above his master, Math. x.
nor the seruau^te better the^ his Lord. If ye world hate you says Christ, ye
know it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, ye world would
love the is his. Ihon. xiiii.
But for as much as ye are not of the world, but I have chose^ you from ye
world, therefore ye world hates you.


Eus. Preachers are commanded of god under pain of da^nacio^ to tell the people
their fautes and yet if they rebuke covetousness, the^ the covetous worldlinges
are mad. If they inuey against pride, the proud are displesed. If they condemn
whoredom, whores, baudes, and rufianes are wood.

Look what soever sin they reprove, the gilty can not abide, but malign the
preacher, and seek to do him displeasure. The Gergesens had rather Christ
should never come among them, yea they had rather go to the devil, the^ they
would have their filthy swine drouned. Math. vii^.



Theo. They owe him evil will says the Prophet, that reproves them openly,
(...)
and whosoever tells the plain truth, him they abhor.


Phile. Well, thus se ye it is no new thing for godly preachers to be
sclaundred and burdened with those fautes, wherein they be nothing gylty.


Chri. I have heard it reported, y^ diverse Gentlemen have been y^ occasion of
al these tumultes and sedicions through the great oppressions and wrongs that
they have done to the (...), as by making common pastutes several to them
selves, Of gentlemen
by enclosinge more ground to their own use, the^ heretofore has been
accustomed, and by this means take away the necessary fode from the pore men's
cattle, without the which they can not live: again, by getting so many
farms in to their hands, and letting out their own lands unto their
tenauntes and farmers for so great price, or else take such large fines and
great incommes, that they ca^ never live of it. These and such like things
have I heard.


Phil. Ye have heard my mind of preachers, which were sclaundred (I speak of
the godly) in this behalf. I will now speak sumwhat of gentlemen. As I do not
allow all that be called preachers, so do I not approve the doings of al the^
that be called gentlemen. And as I do not condemn all preachers, so do I not
dispraise all gentlemen. For as they are, which are true preachers in deed,
so likewise are there which are true gentlemen indede. But some abuse the name
of preachers, by teaching papistrie, a nabaptistry, Epicurisme, etc. and are no
prechers in deed, but rather praters and deceivers of the people: so likewise
are there many which are called gentlemen, and are no gentlemen in deed, but
pollers and pillars, rakers and catchers, bribers and extorcioners, yea and
very caterpillars of the common weal. For they abuse the name of a gentleman,
which is vnfeynedlye a name of much worship and great honor, and worthy to
be had in reverence and hye estimacion. Without the true gentleman the common
weal can no more safely be, then the body without eyes. For as the eyes are
the principal co^^forte of an whole body, so likewise are the true gentlemen
of the common weal. And look what the nose is without smelling, the tongue
without speaking, the hands without feling, the feet without going, the very
same is a common weal without them that are true gentlemen: as the wiseman
says. Prou. xi
Where no good council is, there the people decay, but where as many are that
can give good counsel, there is wealth. For such as are true gentlemen, are
fathers of the country, mainteiners of the pore, defe^ders of the widows and
fatherles, socurers of ye nedy, conforters of the co^fortles, and vpholders of
the common weal, in fine, gentlemen both in name and deed. These be pearls
and iuels to a realm, and as necessari for the co^seruacio^ of a public
weal, as fire, water, and heat is for the health of man's bodi. For their
pricipal respect is not unto their own private lucre, and singular commodity,
but their whole study is how they may profit the common weal and do good to
many, as Salomo^ says: (...)
the ryghteous laboreth to do good, but the ungodly uses his increase unto
sin. Not only their goods, but their very life also will they bestow to do
good to other, so far is it of, that for their own advantage they will
enpoueryshe or hinder any man.


Euse. Would god we had many such ge^tlemen.


Phi. We have without all doubt many, although not so many as I would wyshe,
for of good things we ca^ never have enough. Then is there another sort, which
glory in the title of gentlemen also. And they are such, as this common
proverb notes: As ryseth my good, so ryseth my blood. They think al
nobility to consist in the abundau^ce of worldly goods, in wearinge of golden
cheines, and costly aparel, in having fair houses and pleasant gardens. And
to set forth this their gentlema^ry, they poll they pyl, they wake they ^ake,
they sweat they freate, they gripe they nipe, they face they brase, they
semble they disse^ble, yea they move every stonne, as they say, to maintain
and set forth their unnoble nobility, not caringe how they come by it, so
they have it. All is fyshe that comes to the net: it is good to be taking.
Bonus est odor lucri ex re qualiber. These study not as the true gentlemen do,
to profit many, to do good to the country, to maintain the poor, to relieve
y^ socurles, to nourishe the weak, to cherishe their nedy tenau^tes, neither
seek they the commodity of the common weal, but their own private advantage.
They labor to posses much, Eccle. iii
but they distribute nothing. Their hand is stretched out to receive, but shut
when they should give. If they once exe^pe in to a town or vyllage, they for
the most part never cease, till they have devoured and eaten up the whole
town. What soever is pleasant or profitable, must be theirs by hoke or by
croke. It lies handsomlye for them and so nere their nose, though it be a mile
of. If there be either farm or shepeground, upon the which some honest poor man lives, both he and his family, out he must. Had it must be whatsoever
it cost, though the poor man and all his should go a begging, it lies so
co^modiouslye for our newecome gentleman. If they bye any tenement, and let it
out again to the poor man, O how do they rack it, and stretche out the rentes
thereof, almost from a penny to a pound? yea and some of them biynge house and
land in a town, suffer the houses to fall down, and turn the ground unto
pasture, the poor man not having where to hyde his head. Who will be troubled,
say they, with such a sort of shake ragged slaves in a town, which do
nothing but burn up our hedges, eat up the common, fyl the town full of
beggars braules? Who? No man I trow, namely where such fine and longnosed
gentlemen dwell. Some biynge the lordeshyp of a town, handle the inhabitauntes
thereof on such sort, that they lose diverse of their liberties, being in
much worse case then they were before. Thus ye pore people be so wrou^ge of
these ungentle gentlemen, yt the selye souls are like unto dry haddockes. Some
Irishe men beholdynge them, might well think, that they came latelye out of
Saint Patrickes pargatorye. They are so wythered away even to the hard bones
for cold and ho^ger. Against such churlyshe gentlemen speaks god by ye
Prophet, saiynge: O ye heads of the house of Jacob, and ye leaders of the
house of Israel: ^che. iii.
Should not ye know what were lawful and right? But ye hate the good, and love
the euel, ye pluck of men's skins and the flesh from their bones, ye eat
the flesh of my people, and flaye of their skin, ye break their bones ye
chop them in pieces as it were in to a cauldron, and as flesh into a pot.


Theo. These gredy gripes, and hongry horseleches, by vsurpinge the name of
gentlemen, do much obscure the renown, worship and honor of true gentlemen,
and cause the name of a gentleman to be much disdained among the common
people, as we have both heard and seen now of late days. And though they
challenge to themselves never so much the name of a gentleman, by their goods,
by their auncestoures, by antiquity, by the worthiness of their stock, and
many god morowes, yet if they do degenerate and grow out of kind from the
natural manners of a true gentleman, they are no gentlemen in deed, but carles
and churles, yea and in hurtinge their neighbors they are tirantes and
murderers, Eccle. xxxiiii.
as the holy scripture calls them, E^ai. i
and in pollyng and pyllyng them, Miche. ii.
they are thieves, Sopho. iii.
lions, and wolves as the Prophets term them. An ape shall be an ape, though
she be clad in purple and gold. Esops crow was still a crow, even when he
had decked him self with the pleasant and goodly feathers of other birds.
T^^e nobili^^
It is virtue, and not gross flesh and blood, which thing we all are, that
makes the true, noble and ge^tlema^. It is a mind disposed to do good, yea
and does good in deed when occasion serves, and not sumptuous aparell and
golden cheines, that sets forth true nobility. It is justice, mercy,
liberality. kyndnes, gentleness, hospitality for the poor, and such other
godly gifts of the mind, and not the multitude of riches, that declare who is
a gentleman, and who a churl, who is noble, who unnoble. He that can nyest
approach unto lady virtue, and most lively set forth her natural disposicion
in his conversation and behaueoure, he is the best gentleman, be his parents
never so base, and his kindred never so vile in the judgment of the world.


Christo. Socrates the Philosopher beholding a man very rich and wealthy in
deed, but an assehead in the knowledge of goodness, and notwithstanding
gorgeouse and galante in apparel, said: Behold a golden slave. Socrates
nothing estemynge the rich man for his riches and sumptuous rayement, called
him a golden slave, meaning: that though he were laden with never so many
golden cheynes, golden rings, golden apparel, yet so long as he him self is
but filthy in his conversation, and has a mind subject to carnal lusts,
as couetousenes, pride, ambicion. and cete, he is but a very slave, so far
is it of that he is a gentleman. At an other time that same Philosopher seeing
a man both rich and galauntlye appareled, said: Here is a horse trapped in
silver. His apparel showed him to be a gentleman, but his manners and
conditions declared him to be but a horse and a beast. Diogenes hearing a
certain man bragging and boasting of his kindred, riches, beauty, costuous
aparel, and such other worldly visars, knowing not one point of nobility to
be in him, nor ought else worthy of praise, said: loo, here is a sheep with a
golden flese. Cato the elder was wont to say, that the little thieves did wear
fetters, but the great thieves went up and down galauntly appareled with purple
and gold. I pas over diverse other saiyngs of the wise me^, which without any
respect had to carnal nobility, worldly riches, gorgeous aparell. etc. called
the wealthy worldlinges, by such names, as their manners and behaueoure
deserved.


Euse. Would god all they which will be taken for gentlemen were gentlemen in
deed. Then should it go much better with this realm of England.


Christ. This endless encroching of worldly possessions show evidently, y^ they
which use it are not frindlye to the common weal, seeing through it ye poor
commons are brought to beggarie. Solomon has a notable saiynge and would god
all men would learn it. Prou. x^iii.
It is this. The increase and prosperity of the commons, is the kings honor:
but the decay of the people, is the confusion of y^ prince.


Theo. Frindely to ye common weale^ Mary sir they are not frindlye to the king
by Salomons saiynge, that enpouerysheth the commons: if the commons increase,
wealth, and prosperity be the honor of the king, and if the decay and
enpoueryshement of the commons be the confusion and destruction of the prince,
then are they extreme enemies to the king, which without any respect had to
the common weal, seek through their insatiable couetousenes to beggare the
Kings subjects, whereby they shall be the less able both to serve the
king, and to bear for their portion, the charges of the Realm, when time
requires.


Philemon. Certes a King can never be poor, so long as his subjects be
wealthye. And better it is to have many that should healpe in time of need, then
few, and easier is the burden and the gladlier it is borne yt many bear then
few.


Christo. If that same gentleness and liberality were found at this present
among the rich men of this world, that has been here to fore in men of like
degree, the commons should not only at all times be quiet, but also the realm
should floryshe with great wealth, yea and that universally, where as now it
rests in few men's hands. Gentlemen to be enchrochers of Farms, notable
shepemongers, Grasi^rs, Bochers, Clothiers, Weauers, Brewers. etc^. as I may
speak nothing of their parsonages, vicarages, prebendes. etc having otherwise
whereof abundantly to live? O unworthy act. O unseemly sight. O abhominacion.
What is it to beggare the Realm, to famyshe the Kings subjects, to bring
slavery in to this realm, if this be not? Do they not suck the poor men's
blood, that suffer them not to have whereof to live? The wyseman says: Eccle.
xxxiiii.
The bread of the nedy is the life of the poor, he that defraudeth him of it,
is a murderer.


Philemon. Well neighbors, although I doubt not, but that the Kings
majesty and his most honorable council will se redress in these things when
they have convenient leisure, yet if the world should go forth and continue as
it is, and the rich worldlinges more miserably oppress the pore then they
heretofore have done, god forbid that the common people, or any kind of people
should reise up tumultes, stir up sedicions, lift up their hand against the
hye powers.

For that is a sin, which by no means can escape vnplaged, yea they that so
do, run into the danger of eternal damnacion, as ye have heard before.


Chri. I say god forbid also: but ye know the come^ proverbs, the belli has
no ears, honger is sharper then thorn, necessity is an hard darte, need
makes the old wife trot.


Philem. Saint Paul had rather never to Romans xiiii (...). viii.
eat flesh nor drink wine, then he should offend his weak brother* Would he
then think you, trouble an whole common weal, make vproures, raise up
commocions, come armed in the field, assemble a sort of idle brains and
brainles people together, rob men's houses, spoil their goods, break up
their hedges, make several pastures common to all men, hunte carnal liberty,
make a communion, yea con^usion of al things, and al for the belly? Paul
would rather like unto the pore Lazar have dyed for honger, Luke. xvi.
then once violently and unjustly to take away other men's goods.


Chri. Ye se the unmercifulness of ye rich, what, would ye have the pore people
starve for honger?


Phil. Rather starve and die for honger as pore Lazar did, then to trouble a
common weal. As riches, so likewise poverty comes from god: And both are to
be taken thankefully, and not to be grudged at. If oppression be done to the
pore of the rich worldlinges, shall they avenge them selves? God forbid, yea
rather take that cross patiently, and think that they have deserved far
worser things, which have so often deserved hell, and pray to god to give
those rich men merciful hertes, that according to their duty they may be
moved with pytie and compassion toward the pore. Again if they have injuries
done unto them, if they can not otherwise be redressed let them complain to
the Magistrates and officers of the common weal, which are appointed to hear
men's causes.


Christo. If the poor oppressed complain to the Justices of peace or such
like in the country where he dwells, that has the iniurye done unto him,
little redress, as I hear, can be had, one so serves another turn, even
as the Mules scratche one another back.


Philemon. If there be any such parciall officers, which are not
indifferente, but judge for favor, yet remains there another refuge, and
that is, to complain unto the Kings Majesty and his most honorable
council, which without all doubt will both gladlye hear their lamentable
complayntes, and redress their matters according to justice. But who so
leaves godly means, and attempteth wicked ways, both he and his enterprise
must needs come to naught, as we have seen of late days. Math. xxv^.
The lord him self has spoken it. All they that take the sweard, shall
peryshe with the swearde. All they that are private men, and go about with
force and violence to avenge their own cause, and to redress their own
matters, shall surely come unto destruction. For they be order breakers and
despisers of gods holy ordinance, which has appointed magistrates and head
rulers justly to judge between man and man in all matters of controversy, that
peace and quietenes may be maynteined in a common weal.


Theo. If men were christen men in deed, as they profess in word, they would
never for the bellies sake go about to disturb, trouble, and disquiet all the
members of the body. There is a proverb no less true then common, God never
made mouth, but he made meat. And truly I am thus persuaded, that god, which
made me a living soul, and fed me in my mothers womb, will not, after he has
brought me in to this world, suffer me to peryshe for honger, if I hang on his
fatherlye proui^^^e, cast my care on him, seek to please him, and live in my
vocacion according to his word.


Phil. I am glad neybour Theophile this to hear you speak: for as I may tell
you truth, the principal occasion whi I so greatli desire to speak with you and
with my other neighbors here, was to confort and strengthen you against this
solicitude and thought taking for the belly, wherwyth many at this present
are much vexed. For I am not ignorant what importune su^er the bellye is, and
how she is ever craving and castyng doutes, fearinge that she should never have
inoughe, and therefore continually knocks at the door of the mind, to put
him in remembrance to provide for her, saying: Adfer, Infer, bring hither,
bring in. For the idle belly continuallye consumes, wastes, but gets,
provides nothing. Therefore is she full of thought and care for her living,
even as a beggare is, which is so jealous over his drink, that he will not
suffer the little fly to sit upon the brymme of his cup, lest she should
beguyle him of his drink. This belly care causes the Lawers to corrupt the
law, the judge to give false sentence, the officers to be untrue to their
Lords and masters, the Hipocrites to corrupt the holy scriptures, the rich
men to be vnliberall, unmerciful, the Beneficed men to receive much and
distribute little, the Patrones of benefices, to sell to unlearned Priests
their benefices, parents to sell their children like calves and sheep for
money, the papiste to hate the truth of gods word, the marchaunte to for
swear him self in selling his merchandise, the crafts manne to make and
utter false and sleyghty wares, the temporal Lord to raise his rentes, or to
take great fines and incommes, the I^ne kepers to polle and pylle his geastes,
the servant to rob his master, the maid her masters, the syngle or married
woman to pley the whore, the syngle or married manne to play the Rufian, and
the thief, the subject to rise against his superioure. etc. Innumerable euels
does this belly care bring unto men, against the which except they be
well furnyshed both with strong faith in gods holy providence, and also
fortressed with the knoweledge of holy scriptures, wherein lie buried so
great consolations for the faithful, they can not abide y^ importune and
continual futes of the sluggyshe bellye, but must needs despair of satisfiynge
her requests, and by this means not only have an unquiet mind, but also
throw them selves into desperacion, and so to much wretchedly finishe this
their careful life


Chri. This bellye care without doubt is a great temptacio^ to man, and very
much disquieteth him, namely when he sees all things so dear as they be now,
and despair of a redress, for as much as they which should amend this thing,
are the cause of this dearth and famine, I speak of Grasiers, Shep mongers,
and rich fa^mers. Therefore neighbor Philemon, ye can not entreat at this
present in your communicacion among us of a thing more mete for this beggarly
and nedy wretched time, then to declare unto us by the holy scriptures, how
merc^full and bounteous l^de we have in heaven, which will not suffer us to
peryshe for honger, if we hang on his fatherly providence, and cast al our
care on him.


Phil. This your be^te good will to hear, does not a little encourage me to
speak that which I have purposed, yea and that in few words, because I will
not be tedious unto you.


Eusebius. Speak I pray you, we will give good ear.


Phil. That ye may be thoroughly persuaded of gods liberality toward his
faithful servants, I pray you first of all consider gods order in the
provision for his creatures. Before god made man, whom he was determined to
make the high ruler under him over al things in this world, he made and
prepared every thing necessary for him, and for the conseruacion of his body,
y^ he might abundantly have, what soever is expedient for him, and by no means
peryshe for honger and lack of food. First placing him in paradise that
garden of pleasure, he gave man liberty to eat of all the fruit that grew in
the garden, Gene. ii.
except the tree of knowledge of good and ^uel. After the transgressio^ of gods
commandment, when man was justly driven out of paradise, and worthy for his
disobedience not only to starve for honger, but also to be condemned for ever,
if god for his mercies sake, promised in that blessed sede Christ Jesus, had not
favored and forgeuen him. Gene. iii.
God sending forth man into this vale of misery, did not leave him confo^^les
and without provision for his bodily sustenaunce, neither sent he him into a
bareyn, deserte or ^alte ground void of all fruit, but into this world,
where he found plentye and abundance of all things, and gave him liberty
to eat of all fruits and seeds growing in it. Increase, says he, and
multiply and replenishe the earth, and subdue it and have dominion of the
fyshe of the sea, Gene. i.^
and the foul of the air and of every living thing that moves upon the
earth. And god said: Behold, I have given you every herb, sowinge seed,
which is in the upper face of all the earth, and in every tree in the which is
the fruit of the tree, and that sow^the seed, that they may be meat unto
yo^. With this kind of food was Adam and his posteritye content until the
floude of Nohe. After the floude, God purposinge as it were, to repair man
kind, and to be man's good and merciful lord, and no less but much more
bounteous to him, then he was afore^sayed: bring ye forth, and multiplye and
replenyshe the earth. Gene. i^*
The fear of you, and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth,
and upon every foul of the air, and in all such as the earth brings
forth, and in all the fyshes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.
Every thing that moves it self, and that lives shall be meat for you. Even
as the grene herb, have I given you al things. As god before gave man
liberty to eat al kind of herbs, seeds, and fruits that grow upon the
earth, so likewise gives he man authority now to eat all kind of fyshe or
flesh as he lysteth.


Christ. O exceadinge great is the liberality of our lord god, which deals
so fauorablye with wretched manne: Not only to give him liberty to eat all
kind of herbs, seeds, and fruits, bu^ also all manner of flesh and fyshe.
This is with out doubt a singular benefit and great token of gods
inestimable goodness toward man.


Phi. Here even from the beginning and reparing of man does the kyndenes of
god braste out and show forth it self toward man abundantly, so that now all
things are pure, Tit. i.
to them that are pure. Nothing is commune or unclean, neither is any kind of
meat to be refused, i. Timo. iiii.
if it be taken with thanks geuinge. For that which god has purified and
made clean, Acts. x.
ought no man to call vnpure, unclean. And all these things has god given us
to eat. Now that ye may be thorowlye persuaded of gods truth in performinge
his promises, call to remembrance the histories of the holy scriptures,
which do declare and euidentlye prove, Psalm. ^xlv
that god is faithful in all his words, and deals no less fauorablye with
his servants in deed, then he promises in word. GOD commanded Absalom to
get him out of his country and out of his nation, (...). xii.
and from his fathers house unto a land that he would show him. Abraham did
as the lord commanded him. If Abraham had not been fully persuaded of gods
constancy and truth in accomplyshing his promises, would he have forsaken his
native country, and gone out of his own house, where he was qui^tely placed
and wealthily settled, and wandered abroad like a masterles hounde, he can not
tell whither?


Eusebius. A carnal and worldly wise man would have thought it great madness
to leave a thing certain, for that that is uncertain.


Philemon. So judges the wisdom of this world, ^or. iii.
which is folyshenes before God. Notwythstandinge Abraham nothing doutynge of
gods promise, forsook country, nation and house, and obeyed the voice and
commandment of God. Neither was he any thing at all thereby impoueryshed.
The scripture says, he was very rich in cattle, silver, and gold. For his
native country, God gave him a country that flowed with milk and honye, Gene.
xiii
that is, with the abundaunce of al things. For one house, he gave him many
houses. For one nation, he made him a father of many nations. Romans iiii.
So recompenseth God the losses that any man susteineth for his sake.


Theophilus. The like thing is promised of our savior Christ in the
gospel. There is no man says he, that has forsaken house, Luke. xviii.
either father or mother, either brethren, or wife or children for the
kyngedome of gods sake, which shall not receive much more in this world, and in
the world to come, life ever lasting.


Phil. Who even by this one exemple is not greatli encouraged to believe the
promise of god, and to be fully persuaded, that as god dealte with Abraham, so
in like manner will he deal with us if we obey the voice of god, as Abraham did?
For there is no respect of persons with him, (...)
but in all people he that ^^areth him and works ryghteousenes, is accepted
unto him. The promise of god is universal. Whosoever therefore lays hand on
it with strong faith, he shall have of god, whatsoever he has promised. There
is no difference between the Jew and the Gentile, ^oma. x. ^el, ii.
for one is lord of all, which is rich unto all that call upon him. For
whosoever calls on the name of the Lord he shall be safe.


Chri. It is not without a cause, that thapokles prayed: Lord increase our
faith. Luke. xvii.
For if true and undoubted faith were in the hertes of me^, they would nether
distrust y^ promise of God, nor yet despair of convenient lyuinge.


Phil. Faith is much, yea faith is altogether. Whatsoever ye axe when ye
pray, says Christ believe to have it, Mark. x^.
and ye shall have it in deed: as god showed him self faithful in his promise
to Abraham, which is the father of the faithful, Romans iiii.
so likewise did he to other, because no man should doubt of his liberality,
which is comune not to Abraham only, but to all the faithefull in like manner:
ye remember yt Hager was the hand maid of Sara Abraham's wife and because Sara
her self was barre^ and Gene. xvi
childeles, she gave to her husband her maid to be his wife yt she might be
edified by her.


Christo. We remember it well.


Phil. This Hagar brought forth a son called Ismael, by her master Abraham,
which child was a mocker, in so much yt after Sara had brought forth Isahac
her son, ^ene. xxi.
she would not suffer neither the lad nor his master to tari any longer in her
house, but caused Abraham to put them both out.


Eusebi. Ye say truethe.


Phi. Abraham rose up earelye in the morenynge, and took bread and a bottell
of water and gave it unto Hagar, puttyng it on her shulders with the ladde
also, and sent her away. Now marc^^ Hagar is put out of her masters house
with her child. She knows not whither to go. She has no house wherein to
hide her head, but wandreth up and down in ye wyldernes of Ber Seba. To
conforte her no man is bente: For no man is present. As touching her vitaile,
it is al spent. The bread is eaten, the water is drunk up. There remains
now in sight no more but utterly to despair of soucoure, and miserablye to
dye. Which thing Hagar considering, casts the ladde Ismael under a bushe,
goes her way, and sits on the other side a great way, as it were a bow
shote of, because she would not se the death of the child. With how great
sorrows her heart was stuffed, wha^ plenty of tears gushed out of her eyes,
what careful fayntenes occupied her whole body, no man is able to express. A
child to dye for honger, the mother knowinge of it, yea and as it were in her
syghte, in her bosom, O dolor unspeakable. The mother likewise to be
pearsed with the same darte, O in comparable pain. Al things are brought here
to extreme desperacio^ There is no way to escape this present mischief. The
child cries, the mother wepeth: Both look for present death. But what? Is
god untrue, unjust, false in his promise? Stops he his cares, that he may
not hear the lamentable co^plaintes of the to much wretched? Despises he the
tears of the mother, and the cryinges of the child? Yea rather when no remedy
is looked for, god is present, (...). ^on. xiiii. (...).
god conforteth, god helps, because he will be found a god which is faithful
in all his words, which is the self truth and can not lie, which leaves no
man socurles that calls on him. He sends his holy angel to the miserable
woman, (...) xxi.
when no mortal creature is present to help. He conforteth her, and bids
her not fear: for god has heard, says he, the voice of the child where he
ly^th. He shows her a well of water to confort both her and her child
withal, and afterward pr^miseth that the lad Ismaell shall be a noble man, and
great multitudes of people shall rise of him.


Theo. O history full of most sweet consolacion. This is a confortable and
pleasant mirror for all people to behold, specially for them that are
married, and yet se not (such and so great is their poverty) how they may
be able to noryshe them. If the married folk live according to their vocacion,
and travail in their estate in the fear of the lord, though they have never
so many children and great family, yet shall the sea sooner be without water
and fyshe, and the land without grass and cattle, then any of them shall
perish for honger. If god provided for Ismaell and his mother in the
wyldernes, where no sustenau^ce was to be gotten, where no man was present but
brute beasts, and fowls of the air: will he leave the^ socourles, that put
their trust in him, be-being in cities, towns, and villages, and co^uersant
with men, where all things do abou^d?


Chri. If the pore married me^ did earnestly wey, and diligently ponder this
most sweet and confortable history, they should never despair of a living,
neither for the^ selves, nor for their children and family, neither would they
seek any unlawful means, as by stierring up co^mocions, making
insurreccions, spoylynge other men's goods etc, how to avoid their misery: but
rather labor to answer their vocacion, and without ceassing call on the name
of the lord, which will deal no less favorably with the^, then he did with
Hagar and Ismaell. Put thou thy trust, (...) xxxv^i.
says David, in the lord, and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the earth,
and be fed with the best daynties thereof. Delyghte thou in the lord, and
he shall give the thy hertes desire. Commit thy way to the lord, and put thy
trust in him, and he shall bring it to pass. He shall make thy ryghteousenes
as clear as the light, and thy just dealing as the noone day. Hold the
still in the lord, and abide patiently upon him. etc Again: Put your trust
in God always, Psalm. lxii.
O ye people, power out your hertes before him, for he is our hope.


Philemo. In the days of Isahac Abraham's son, there fell a great dearthe in
the land where he dwelte, in so much that he removed from that place, and
took his iourneye toward Abimeleche King of the Philistines, Gene. xxv^
even unto Gerer. And while he was yet in his journey, god spoke unto him and
said.

Go not down into Egipte, but abide in the land which I shall show unto the,
soieorne in this land, and I will be with the, and will bless the. For unto the
and to thy sede, I will give al these contreis. Behold gods careful
providence for his servants. Isahac wyshing to escape the cruel daries of
honger, hunteth about where he and his may conuenie^tlye dwell. And rather
then he would die for honger, he after the example of his father Abraham, ^.
xii.
determines to go down into Egipte. God which is able to feed and to save his
people in every place (for the earth is the lords ^l. xxiiii.
and all that is contained therein) for bids Isahac to go down into Egypt,
wylleth him to tarry still in the country, and promises to bless him, yea to
give to him and to his sede, all the contreis of that land. Isahac obeying the
voice of god, tarried in that country, and waxed exce^ding mighty, wealthy and
rich. For god gave him great abundaunce of corn, of sheep, and of oxen, yea
with a myghtie household did the lord bless him, insomuch that the king him
self came unto him, and desired to make acouenau^t of peace and amity with
him: unto such and so great power was Isahac grown. He which before knew not
where co^modiously to live, and in y^ country which he would have forsaken for
penury and honger, even he now is become so rich, that the king him self
is glad to come to him, and to desire his favor.


Eus. O wonderful works of god.


Chri. Here find we that true, which is spoken by the wyseman: Put thy trust
in god, and abide in thine estate, for it is an easy thing in the sight of
god, Eccle. xi.
to make a poor man rich, yea and that suddenly. The blessinge of god hastes
to the reward of the ryghteous, and makes his fruits sone to florishe and
prosper.


Theo. This in deed was proved true in Isahac. phil. Not in Isahac only, but
in so many as ever obeyed the voice of God, and lived according to their
vocacion. God is the same god to us all, that he was to Abraham and Isahac, if
we by strong faith hang on him and on his fatherlye providence, as they did,
if the same integrity of manners and innocence of life apeareth in us, that
shined in them.


Euse. This beneficence and liberality of god toward Isahac ought to
encourage al men to tarry at home in their own contreis and houses, to be
content with their estate and calling, and not to stray a broad for
liuinges, as many idle brains do now a days, leauinge their wives and their
children in great care and misery, and many of them never returning unto
the^. Neither ought men to doubt, but that god which is almighty, and able to
do what soever his good pleasure is, will as well provide for them at home in
their poor cotages, as in the haulles of Princes. The blessinge of the lord
makes men rich, Prove. x.
as for careful travail it does nothing thereto.


Phil. When Isahac sent his son Jacob to Mesopotamia, Gene. xxviii.
y^ he might take to wife one of y^ daughters of Laba^, Jacob as he passed
forth on his journey, made a vow, and said: If god will be with me, and will
keep me in this journey which I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothes
to put on, so y^ I come again unto my fathers house in safetye, the^ shall y^
lord be my god, and this stone which I have set up an end, shall be gods
house, and of all that thou shalt give me will I give the tenthe unto thee.
Here Jacob desires gods assiste^ce in his journey, that he may go and come
safe. And as touching worldly goods, he desires no more but food and
raiment. And so nothing douting of gods help, he goes forward on his
journey according to the commandment of his father. Now behold the loving
kyndnes of god toward Jacob. God which never leaves them socourles that call
on his holy name, appears unto Jacob in his sleep, and promises that he will
give him and his seed the land that he slepeth upon, and that his posterity
shall be great and many, that they shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall
spread abroude to the weaste, to the east, to the north, and to the south, yea
and that in his sede all kinreds of the earth shall be blessed.


Chri. Here are mo benefits promised to Jacob, then he asked.


Phil. Yea mo then he durst have required of god


Euse. But what of the requests co^cerninge his journey?


Phil. Ye shall hear. Where as Jacob desired god to be with him, and to keep him
in his journey, god said unto him on this manner: Behold I am with the and will
be thy keeper in all places whither thou go, and will bring the again into
this land, neither will I leave the until I have made good all that I have
promised the. According to gods promise Jacob had a prosperous journey
trauailynge into Mesopotamia. Of whose coming, when Laba^ heard, unto whom he
was sent of his father, Gene. xxi^.
Laban for very joy ran to mete him, enbrased him, and kissed him, and
brought him to his house


Theo. This was good luck.


Chri. Good luck in deed.


Phi. So works god for his servants, which has all men's hearts in his
hand.


Theo. But what entertainment had Jacob afterward?


Phil. Jacob tarried with Laban twenti years: in the which time, God did not
only send him bread and clothes according to his request, but also such
wives as his heart desired, with many goodly children. Yea God so blessed
Jacob, that he was exceeding rich in gold and silver, in maid servants and
men servants, in sh^pe, Camels, Asses, Gene. xxxi.
goats, kyne. etc. And afterward God brought him home again into his contreye
both saffelye and wealthely. Who will now distrust the promise of such a
Lord, so liberal, so bounteous so beneficial?


Euse. This history is greatly comfortable for all godly traua^lers by
co^treies, hereof may they learn, y^ god will not forsake the^ nor leave the^
socourles, but se^d the^ al things necessary in their journey, defend them
from their ennemies, and safely bring them who^ again, if they call on his
holy name and cast their care on him.


Chri. So says the Psalmographe, Psalm. xci.
he shall give his Angels charge over the, to keep the in all thy ways. They
shall bear the in their hands, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.
God shall defend the under his wings, and thou shall be safe under his
feathers. His faithfulness and truth shall be thy sheld and buckelar. Thou shall
not be afraid for any terror by night, nor for y^ arrowe y^ flye^th by y^ day.
Psalm. cxx^.
Again, my help comes even from y^ lord which has made heaven and earth. He
will not suffer thy foot to be moved, and he that keeps the, will not sleep.
Behold he that keeps Israel shall neither slomber nor sleep. The Lord him
self is thy keeper, the Lord is thy defense upon thy right hand.

So that the sun shall not burn the by day, neither the moon by night. The
Lord shall preserve the from all evil, yea it is even he that shall keep thy
soul. The Lord shall preserve thy goinge out and thy coming in from this
time forth for evermore.


Theo. Thes^e be sweet and comfortable scriptures


Phil. I grant to the faithefull, which depend altogether on God and on his
fatherlye providence. But the unfaithful, which trust on them selfs, on
their own wisdom, and policy, feel no savor nor swetnes in them, as saint
Paul says: a natural man perceaueth not the things that belong to the
spirit of god (...)
for they are folyshnes unto him. But let us behold mo histories, which shall
declare and set forth gods hi^ providence and singular liberalite toward his
servants, y^ we may learn perfectli to ha^ge on the lord our god. Ye read
in the first book of Moses, that in the time of Jacob whom we spoke of a little
before, Gene. xli.
there was a great dearth in all contreis, in so much that in the land of Canaan
there was no vitaile to be gotten for money. Now behold the providence of god.
God aforeseyng this plage of famine, to the entente that his servants should
not peryshe in time of honger for lack of fode, Gene. xxxvii.
wonderfully sent Joseph before into Egipte. And although his brothers sold him
in to a strange land, by this means sekyng his destruction, yet god turned
this his servitude unto his honor, and the euel that they did to their
brother, unto their profit, wealth, Gene. iiii.
and commodity. For god exalted Joseph, and set up his honor above all the
lords and princes of Egipte: even next unto the King was he in dignity, in
so much that he had the rule of all the kings dominions, and did what seemed
him good in his own eyes, such favor found he in the sight of the king
through gods working. Now when this dearth was also felt in the land of
Canaan, and Jacob with his family in great danger thereof, ^ene. xlii.
Jacob hearing that corn was to be sold in Egypt (for through Iosephes
wisdom was there corn inoughe laid up in the store houses of every City
in Egipte) ^ene. xli.
sent his sons thither to bye corn for their money, that they might live
and not die. To be short, seeing the history is known, when the sons of
Jacob came thither for vitaile, there was Joseph their brother in hie
authority, who^ they judged either to be dead, or else to live like a bond
slave and drudge, not able either to do him self good or any other. In few,
they had vitailes home with them, and their money also, with many precious
gifts, and at the last a commandment given them y^ they should bring their
father and his Gene. xlii ^ ^. xiv.
household with all that he had, and provision should be made for them even in
the best parts of the land of Egipte. Yea the king him self sent char^ttes
out of Egypt to fetch Jacob and all his family, and bad them not regard
their stuff, for the good of all the land of Egipte is youres, says he.
Jacob and all his were honorablye brought thither, liberally and gently
enterteyned of the king, Gene. x^v^.
quietely and wealthelye placed in the land of Egypt. And all this came to
pass by the providence of God, which before seeing things to come, works
wonderfullye for the sauegarde and health of his servants.

For the cause that Jacob and his children found such favor in the sight of
king Pharao, was not fortune, nor chance, but gods providence: again, that
Joseph was exalted unto such dignity, the cause thereof was not Iosephes fair
face, nor yet his goodly personage, but gods good will, which gave him such
wisdom, as none had the like in all Egipte, neither was there any in all the
dominions (...)
of king Pharao found like unto Joseph, whom the king might make governor
over his realm. And al these things wrought god for the preseruacio^ of his
servants as Joseph himself said to his brethren: (...) xlv.
I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold in to Egipte. Now therefore be not
grieved therwyth, neither let it seem a cruel thing in your eyes that ye sold
me hither. For god did send me before you into Egipte for your wealth, and to
save your lives. For this is the second year of dearth in the land, and five
mo are behind, in which there shall be neither earing nor heruest. Wherefore
god sent me before you to make provision, that ye might continue in the earth,
and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So now it was not you that
sent me hither but god, which has made me a father unto Pharao, and lord of
all his house, and ruler through out all the land of Egipte. God him self
also spoke unto Jacob in a vision by night, saying: I am god, the god of thy
father, fear not to go down into Egipte, for I will there make of the a
great people. I will go down with the into Egipte, and I will also bring the
again.


Chri. O the unspeakable good will of god toward all them that trust in him.
What other nation, says Moses, is so great that gods come so nigh unto,
^eut. iiii.
as the lord our god is nigh unto us in all things, so often as we call unto
him? The Lord our god is a merciful god, he will not forsake us, neither
destroy us, nor forget the appointement of our fathers, which he swear unto
them. The lord our god cherysheth us even as a father does his son. Will a
mother forget the child of her womb, says god, (...). xlix.
and not pity the son, whom she bare? And though she does forget, yet will
not I forgette the. Behold I have written the up upon my hands. etc.


Theo. The last history which you rehearsed, neighbor Philemo^, is very
comfortable, and teaches us that although the plage of famine be cast upon
any realm, and the wicked thereof peryshe for honger, yet will god so provide
for them that fear him, and call on his holy name, that they shall want no good
thing.


Phil. Well noted neighbor Theophile. So would I have you both hear and read
the histories of y^ holy scriptures, y^ ye should persuade your self that what
soever confortable history ye find in the sacred bible, is there written for
your comfort. And to prove your saying true, Esa^. l^v.
hear what god says by the Prophet. Behold my sernauntes shall eat, but ye
shall honger. Behold mi servants shall drink, but ye shall suffer thirst.
Behold my servants shall be merye, but ye shall be confounded. Behold my
servants shall rejoice for a very quietness of heart, but ye shall cry for
sorrow of heart, and complain for vexacion of mind.


Eusebius. The saying of King David does not much differ from this. Psalm.
xxx^i^i.


Behold the eyes of the lord are upon them that fear him, and upon them that
trust in his mercy, that he may deliver their lives from death, and noryshe
them in time of honger. Prove. x.
Solomon also says: the lord will not let the life of the ryghteous suffer
honger.


Phil. After god had delivered the Israelites out of Egipte with an out
stretched arm, and brought them into the wyldernes of Sin, where they saw
neither meat nor drink (for god was determined to prove them whether they were
faithful or not) they grudged against Moses and Aaron, Exod^. xvi.
saying: would to God we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of
Egypt, when we satte by the flesh pottes, and when we did eat bread our
bellyes full. For ye have brought us out into this wilderness to kill the
hole multitude with honger.

Ye se the vnthanckefulnes of this people for who^ God had wrought so many
wonders, and to whom God had showed so great tokens of loving kyndenes, even
as a father does to his child. Ye have heard how they murmured against Moses
and Aaron Gods laweful ministers, which is nothing else then to murmr
agenst God him self. Ye se their unfaithfulness, and how they are altogether
swarued from God and from his holy providence, so that they are worthy no
benefit at the hand of God: but what the^? Is God false of his promise? yea
rather eue^ for his promis sake (where unto God has ever chief respect)
which he made to their fathers Abraham, Isahac and Jacob, he wonderfullye
sent them down meat from heaven, eue^ ma^na, and so fed the^ as y^ wise man
says: you have fed thine own people with angels food, and sent the^ bread
redye from heaven without their labor, ^^pi. xvi.
being very pleasant and good of taste. And to show the riches and swetnes
unto thy children thou gave every one their desire, so that every man might
take what lyked him best.


Theo. If God for his promise sake fedeth the unfaithful and no les
vntha^ckefull Israelites from heaven, we that believe his promises, and ha^ge
only on him and on his fatherlye providence, may be sure not to want but
abundantlye to have what so ever is necessary for us, ^sal. cxliii.
as ye Psalmographe says: The eyes of all things look and wait upon the O
Lord, and thou geueste them meat in due time. Thou openest thy hand, and
replenishest all things living with thy blessing.

Ageine: They that fear the Lord shall have no scarsenes. ^sal. xxxiiii.
They which seek the Lord, shall want no^ good thing.


Chri. God shall sooner cease to be God, then such as unfeignedly trust in him,
shall peryshe for honger.


Phil. As ye Israelites murmured for meat, so likewise did they for water. Exodus
xvii.
They came to Moses and chide with him, yea they were almost redye to stone him,
and said. Give us water to drink. Wherefore haste thou brought us out of
Egipte to kill us and our children and cattalle with thyrste? The Lord God
still con^^derynge his promyses, and not weyinge their in fidelity nor
vnthanckefulnes, wo^derfullye and against all natural and humayne
expectacio^, gave them plentye of sweet waters out of the hard stonye rock.


Euse. O the maruelouse worckes of God. He is not called almyghtye without a
canse. For he does what so ever his good pleasure is.

It is truly said of David: Psalm. cxlvii.
great is our Lord, and great is his power, yea his wisdom is infinite. Who
will now doubt of necessari food, seeing God so meruelously fedeth the
unfaithful, vntha^ckefull and disobediente people?


Phi. At a another time the rascal people yt was among them, being wearye of
the meat sent down from heaven, fell a lustynge, and turned the^ selfs and
wept (even as did also ye children of Israel) and said: who shall give us
flesh to eat? We remember the fyshe which we did eat in Egipte for naught,
and ye cucu^bers, and melons, lekes, onions and garlecke. But now our soul
is dried away, ^ume. xi. and. xxi
for we can se nothing else save Manna. And our soul lotheth this light
bread. Ye see that these people are still like them selfs, that is,
unfaithful, vntha^kefull, disobediente. O froward and crooked generacio^, Deuteronomy
xxxii.
says Moses, do ye so reward the Lord, O ye folyshe people and unwise?


Chri. It is not without a cause, that saint Stephen called that nation
styfnecked, Acts. (...).
uncircumcised hearts and ears, and such as always resyste the holy ghost.


Phil. Well yet note: Notwithstanding their infidelity, vnthanckefulnes, and
disobedience God continued still just in his promises, faithful in his words,
and true in his dealings, for according to their desire for his promise sake,
he would not suffer them to want, but gave them whatsoever they lusted for.
There went forth a wind from the Lord, says the scripture, Nume. x^.
and brought quails from the sea and let them fall about the host, eue^ a days
iournei round about on every side of ye host, and they did fly in the air as
it were two cubits hye over the earth.

And the people stood up, and all that day, and all that night, and on the
morrow they gathered quayles. And he that gathered a little, gathered ten homers
full. And they spread them abroad round about the host. Thus se ye how God
for his promise sake, cheryshed the Israelytes although unfaithful,
unthankful and disobedient, even as ye Nurse does her sucking babe, and
fed them by the space of.xl. years in ye wilderness without their pain, care,
trayuayle or labor.


Theo. If God showed such gentilnes to the vnfaithefull and disobediente for
his promise sake, how much more will he show him self a gentle and loving
father to them that fear him, believe in him, love him, and for their powers
labor to walk in his holy pathwaies?


Phil. Such shall never want. Now marcke what follows. As god provided meat
for the Israelites, so in like manner suffered he them not to go naked, nor to
peryshe for cold, but all that time of fortye years, when they were in the
wilderness, he so preserved their clothes, that they waxed not old, and so
saved their shoes that they were not worn: but both garments and shoes so
whole at the forty years end, as they were at their first coming into
wilderness. Deu. xxix.
I have led you forty years in the wilderness, says god: and your clothes
are not waxed old upon you, neither are the shoes of your feet, worn. Ye
have eaten no bread, nor drunk wine, or strong drink, that ye might know
that I am the Lord your god. Moses also says: god humbled the, and suffered
the to honger, and fed the with Manna, which neither thou nor thy fathers knew
of, to make the to know that man does not live by bread only, Deute. viii.
but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord, does a man
live. Thy rayement waxed not old upon the, neither did thy foot swell those
forty years. Here of may ye perceive, how bountiful God is in geuynge food
and apparel, to them specially yt fear him, and keep his holy
commandments. Who will now be careful either for the bellye, or for the
back, as they say? God made the^ both, God will nourishe them both


Eus. These histories do so set forth the kindenes of God toward man, that
none except very infideles have just occasion to despair of Gods
liberality, if they call on his name and travail according to their vocacion.


phil. There is no thing more certain. But lest any man should thyncke, that
this kyndnes of god ceased in them, of whom I have hitherto spoken, I will
rehearse one or two histories mo out of the old testamente, and then allege
certain out of the new, whereof ye may learn that other proved the like
kyndenes at the hand of god even as well in the new testament as in the old,
that by this means ye may be perfectlye persuaded god to be the Lord of the
same liberality now, that he was before, and alike kind to his servants in
all ages. Who knows not y^ Elias was an excellent Prophet of god, fervent in
spirit, vehement in word, and ielous for the glory of god?


Chri. The scriptures testify no less of him. Eccle. xlviii.



Theo. Elias stood up as fire, says the wiseman, and his word brent like a
cresset. While he lived he was afraid of no Prince, and no man might overcome
him. Of his praise writes Jesus the son of Syrache.


Phil. This man of God lived in the time of Achab king of Israel, in whose
days God sent a great dearth into the world, for it rained not upon the earth
by the space of iii. years and.vi. months. In this plage of famine, whereof
innumerable without dyed, se how God provided for his servant Elias. First
when the waters began to be dried up, Reg. xvii.
God sent him to the brook Cherith, where he promised to give him drink,
which thing he unfeignedly performed: so that when other perished for lack of
drink, he had Gods plentye and inoughe, as they use to say. Now as
touching his meat, behold the wonderful power of God, which commanded the
Ravens to feed him and to bring him meat. The Ravens, says y^ scripture,
brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and likewise bread and flesh in
the eueninge, and he drunk of the broke. Behold and mark well, how god
provides for his servant. He makes the fowls of the air to be Elias
cooks, and to bring him meat, and god him self is butler and geuith him drink
at ye broke Cherith. O what a god have the faithful, how tender and gentle,
how louinge and kind is he to al the^ that put their trust in him? Rather
then his servant should die for meat, he makes the fowls of the air to
bring him things necessary for the sustenau^ce of his body. O behold and
di^^gently mark ye fatherli care, which the lord god has for his servants
Even as a father pitieth his own children, Psalm. ^iii.
eue^ so is the lord merciful to the^ y^ fear him. It is truly said of y^
Psalmograph: Psalm. xlv.
The lord is at hand to all the^ that call on him, yea to all the^ that call on
him in truth.


Theo. Elias might right well say, as Dauyd wrytethe of him self. ^^al.
xxlil.
The Lord fedethe me, therefore can I lack nothing. He shall feed me in a
gre^e pasture, and lead me for the beside the waters of conforte.


Eus. As God dealte with Elyas and David, so will he deal with us, if we
labor to please him as they did.


Chri. So I trust, for there is no respect of parsones with God. ^m. ii.
And what so ever is written, is written for our learning, ^es. x.
yt through patience and comfort of ye scriptures ^^o ii.
we may have hope. ^ma. v



Phil. Ye say truethe. Neither did the care of God cease for his servant
Elias with that benefyte, whereof ye have hitherto heard. For God is no
chaungelinge, whom he loves, he loves to the end. Therefore when the brook
was dried up because there fell no rain upon the earth, ^ Reg. xvii.
God, which never leaves his servants socourles* said to Elias, up and get
the to Sarepta, which is in Sidon, and dwell there, behold I have commanded a
widow there to sustain the. So he arose, and went to Sarepta. And when he
came to the gate of the city, the wydowe was there gatheryng styckes. And he
called to her and said: fet me I pray the a little water in a vessel, yt I may
drink. And as she was going to fet it, he cried after her, and said: Bring
me I pray the a morsel of bread also in thine hand. She said: As truly as
the Lord thy God lives I have no bread redye, but even an handefull of meal
in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse. And behold I am gatherynge two
styckes for to go in, and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat and
dye. And Elias said unto her: fear not, come and do as thou have said, but
make me thereof a little cake first of al, and bring it unto me, and
afterward make for the and thy son. For thus says the Lord God of Israel:
the meal in the barel shall not be waked, neither shall the oil in the cruse be
diminished, until the Lord have sent rain upon the earth. And she did as Elyas
said. And she and her house did eat a good space, and the meal wasted not out
of y^ barrel, neither was the oil spent out of the cruse according to the word
of the lord, which he spoke by the hand of Elyas. Here again ye se what
prouysyon God made for Elyas, and how benefycyall he also was to Elyas
hostess, and to her householde, because she entertained him so gentyllye and
did what so ever he commanded.


Theo. These be comfortable hystories.


Euse. And written for our conforte.


Phil. At another time when he fled from wicked Iesabel king Achabs wife,
(...). Reg. xi^
which swear that she would surely sley him, because he had killed all Baals
priests, whom she full deintely nouryshed at her own table, how did god, even
when he was a sleep, send his Angel unto him with a loaf of broyled bread,
and a vessel of water, and bad him eat? For thou have yet, says he, a great
journey to go. And in the strength of that meat, says the scripture, walked
he forty days and forty nyghtes, even unto Horeb the mount of God. Here se
ye, that when we sleep, god watches and cares for us, even as he cared for
Peter, Acts. xii.
and sent his Angel to deliver him out of prison, when Peter was in a
sound sleep, and thought nothing at all of the matter. Behold says the
Psalmographe, Psalm. cxxx^
he that keeps Israel, shall neither slomber nor sleep. Note agein, that
with one meals meat God is able to preserve us forty days and forty
nyghtes, as he did the Prophet Helyas, yea all our life time, ^ute. viii.
if it be his pleasure, so that it is truly said, man shall not live with
bread alone, but with every word, that comes out of y^ mouth of God: And
as God made prouysion for Elias even so stoored he up Abdia Governor of wicked
king Achabs house to petye his Prophets and to provide for them: (...) Reg.
xviii.
which when diuilishe Queen Iesabel destroyed the Prophets of God, took an
hundred of them, and hyd them, fyfti in one cave, and fyftye in a another, and
provided bread and water for the^: such and so great is the care, which the
Lord takes for his servants universally.


Chri. It is therefore truly said of the Princelyke Prophet, Psalm. xxxiiii.
they y^ seek the Lord shall want no good thing. Ageine: I have been young and
am waxen old, Psalm. xxxvi^.
and I have not seen ye righteous forsaken, nor his children beggynge their
bread on the earth.


Theo. These be comfortable histories for christian and Godli preachers, whom
for the most part the wicked and unthankful world neglects, despyseth and
set naught by, yea and makes les provision for them, then for their malte
horses and bandedogges. Here may the true Prechers se, yt although the world
regards them nothing at all, and suffers them so much as in them is, not
only miserable to live, but also to peryshe for honger, yet God, whose
ministers they are, whose word they preach, will not suffer them extremelye to
want, but will either wonderfullye feed them him self, as he did Elyas, or
else store up some good Abdie to make provision for the^, as this Abdi did for
the Prophets of the Lord, when they hyd them in the caves from the tira^ny of
queen Iesabel, and provided things necessary for their living.


Phil. We read also that a certain woman of y^ wives of the Prophets came
unto Heliseus the Prophet, iiii. Reg. iiii.
declaringe unto him, that her husband was dead, and that for debt which she
ought and was not able to pay, the creditour was come to fet her.ii. sons to
be his bond men. This woman was a Prophets wife. Her husband is dead, which
left her both pore and in debt. Comfort has she none, but only the company
of her.ii. sons which also the creditour would take away and make his bond
men, because she is not able to discharge the debt. O in what miserye is this
careful woman? She has nothing at al in her house, but a pitcher of oil.
But what is that to the dispatche of the debt. And if that be gone, there
remains nothing whereof she and her sons may live. What is then to be done?

Det must be paid. Her substance will not reach so far. To make her children
bond slaves, should be to her present death. This therefore remains. The
sorrowful widow lame^teth first of all her cause secretly in her heart unto
god, which is the helper and patron of all true wyddowes and fatherless
children, and afterward utters the same to Elizeus the Prophet of god,
which through gods blessinge of one pytcher of oil, fills so many empty
vessels full of oil, that she sellinge part of the same, was not only able to
pay her dettes at the uttermost, but also had enough of the rest to find her
and her children.


Eus. O notable miracle. Here find we true yt holy Thoby said to his son:
^obi. iiii.
My son, be not afraid.

Truth it is, we lead here a poor life, but great good shall we have, if we
fear god, and depart from al sin, and do well.


Chri. This woman's husband was a Prophet, and feared the lord, therefore could
not she and her children remain long confortles. For god has promised to be
a husband to such widows, and a father to such godly men's children. Psalm.
xxxvii.
I have not seen the ryghteous forsaken, nor their children begging their bread
on the earth, Psalm. cxii.
says the Psalmographe. Again: Blessed is the man that fears the lord, he
has great delyght in his commandments. His sede shall be myghtie upon
earth, the generation of the faithful, shall be blessed. Riches and
plenteousenes shall be in his house, and his ryghteousenes endures for ever.


Theo. This is a confortable history for such godly women as are christen
preachers wives. Hereof may they learn, that though their husbands be never so
poor, when they depart out of this world, yet if they remain faithful, and in
the fear of god, and diligently call on his blessed name in their adversity,
he will neither suffer them nor their children to lack necessaries for their
living, but by one means or other send them all good things, so that they
shall not want. Iosu. i.
I will not fail the, nor yet forsake the, Psalm. clv.
says god. The lord gives meat to the hongry. Psalm. xxxiiii.
Behold the eyes of the lord are upon them that fear him, and upon them that
trust in his mercy, that he may deliver their lives from death, and nouryshe
them in the time of honger. God despises not the desire of the fatherles nor
the wydowe, Eccle. xxxv.
says the wyseman, when she powers out her prayer before him. Does not god
se the tears that run down the chekes of the widow? or heateth he not the
complaint over such as make her to weep? For from her chekes do ye tears go
up unto heaven, and the lord which hears them, does accept the^.


Phil. At a another time also we read, yt thaforesayd Prophet in the time of
dearth fed the Prophets children, iii. Reg. iii^.
and with a few loaves norished a great number of men, in somuche that they did
not only eat enough, but also left much of ye bread, so greatly was it
multiplied through ye blessing of god, which is able of a little to make much,
seeing of nothing he made al. Give unto the people, yt they may eat, says ye
Prophet. The minister answered: What, should I set this before an hundred men?
Set it before the people, says he, and let them eat, For thus says the lord:
They shall eat and leave. And he did set it before them, and they did eat and
leave according to the word of the lord. Se ye not here, what the blessyng of
the lord is, and how al things increase and abound, Psalm. cxlv.
when the lord opens his hand? If we depend on gods goodness, he will
surely increase our vitayle in our store houses, upon our table, yea in our
mouths and bellies.

The Prophets servant though it not possible, that so great a number of men
could be sustained with so few loaves. Math. xix.
But that which is impossible with men, Mark. x.
is possible with god. Luke. xviii.


Who therefore will doubt any more of gods liberality, have he much, or
have he little? It is all one before God to feed with much, or to feed with
little.

If god bless us, we can not want, but if Gods blessinge be taken from us, we
must needs peryshe.


Euse. So says the Psalmographe: Psalm. iiiii.
All creatures depend upon the O lord, that thou should give them their meat
in due time. For thou giving it them, they take it, and thou opening thy hand,
they are well satisfied. But you hidinge thy face, they are sorrowful, and thou
taking away their breath, they are but dead, and turned into the earth, that
they came of.


Phil. How wonderfully did God feed Daniel the Prophet, when he was cast in
to the Lions den of the hye rulers, because he said that the great Dragon,
whom they of Babylon worshipped as god, was not god? ^an^. xiiii.
Did not the Angel of the lord take the Prophet Abacucke by the top, when he
was goinge in to the field to bear meat to the mowers, and carried him by the
herre of the head, and through a mighty wynd set him in Babylon, upon the
den, where Daniel was? So carye thy meat, says the Angel, that thou haste
into Babylon unto Daniell, which is in the Lions den. And when Abacuch eryed
and said: O Daniell thou servant of God, have take thy breakefaste, y^ God
has sent the. Daniel answered: O god have thou thought upon me? well:
Thou never fayleste them that love the. What a lively example is this of gods
singular providence and fatherly care, which he has for his servants?
Notable and worthy to be written in letters of gold, is this saying of
Daniel. Thou never faylest them that love the.


Chri. This history is very confortable for all the^ that suffer inprisonment
for the glory of god, and the confession of his truth. Hereof may they learn,
that god will not lean them socourles, nor destitute of help, as David says:
The lord is my light and my health, ^al. xxvii.
who^ then shall I fear? The lord is the defender of my life, of whom then
shall I be afraid? When mine enemies came upon me to eat up my flesh, they
stoumbled and fell. Therefore though an host of men were laid against me, yet
shall not my heart be afraid, yea and though there rose up war against me,
yet will I put my trust in him.


Phil. As I may leave of the historyes of the old Testament, and rehearse
certain out of the new, that we may learn gods liberality toward his
servants to be one and the same at all times, and in all ages, let us call
to remembrance the wonderful miracles that Christ wrought for the
sustenaunce of his people. Read we not that our Savior Christ at a certain
time fed almost five Math. xiiii.
thousand men beside women and children with five loaves and two fyshes?
Mark. vi.
And yet when they all had eaten inoughe, Luke. ix.
they gathered up so much of the fragmentes that be left, John. vi.
as filled twelve baskets full. At a another time, when the people had been
with Christ three days, and were ready to depart, having nothing to eat,
and some of them had far to go, so that if they had gone away without
meat, they should have faynted by the way, what a fryndlye care had Christ
for them? I have compassion on the people, says he, because they have
continued with me three days, Math. xv.
and have nothing to eat. Mark. viii
And I will not let them depart fasting, lest they peryshe by the way.

And when his disciples said: whence should we get so much bread in the
wiloernes, as should suffice so great a multitude, and told him that they had
but seven loaves, and a few little fyshes, he commanded the people to sit
down on the ground, and took the seue^loaues and the fishes, and geuyng
thanks, brake them, and delivered them to his disciples, and the disciples to
the people, and they all did eat and were filled.

And they took up of ye broken meat that was left, seven baskets full. And
yet they that did eat were.iiii. thousand men besides women and children. Here
se ye, that the loaves and fyshes were multiplied in the hands of the
disciples, and in the mouths and bellies of them that did eat through Christ's
blessing, so mighty is he to preserve the lives of his servants in the time
of need.


Theo. This is a confortable history for all them that love to hear the word
of god, and to frame their life according to the same. Such may be sure not to
want the liberality of god in their necessity, which, i. Timo. vi.
as S. Paul says, gives us all things abundauntly to enjoy the^.


Chri. This affirms that princelyke Prophet, Psalm. xxxiiii
saying: The rich shall want and suffer ho^ger, but they which seek the lord,
shall want no good thing.


Phil. When Christ and his mother with his disciples were at the marriage in Cana
a city of Galile, John. ii.
ye know that ye gestes wanted wine. What, spared he his liberality from them?
Yea rather did he not command the seruitoures to fill the water pottes with
water? And when they had filled even unto the bryme.vi. water pottes of sto^ne,
containing.ii. or three fyrkins a piece, did not he turn all y^ water in to
sweet wine? Certes they can want nothing, which have Christ present with them.
Let us provide that we have Christ among us, and we may be sure to have
abundau^ce of al good things.


Euse. This history is very confortable for all married persons, which mary in
ye lord. Al such that so mary, and continue in the fear of god, may be sure,
that the water in their wells shall sooner be turned into wine, and the stones
of their walls in to bread, and the claye of their flores into meat, and ye
thatch of their houses in to cloth, then they shall extremely want necessary
things, either for them selves or for their family.


Chri. Would god al me^ believed this. Then should they have merrye and quiet
minds, where now through infidelity they be miserablye disquieted with the
care of worldly things.


Theo. Lay thy care on the lord, says David, ^sal. lv.
and he shall noryshe the. i. Peter. v.
Also. S. Peter: Cast all pour care on god, for he cares for you.


Phil. Again, Math. x.
how did our savior Christ provide for his disciples, when he sent them forth
to preach, without money or meat? as he him self says in the gospel of
Luke. Luke. xxii.
When I sent you without wallet, and scryp and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And
they said: No. The disciples according to their vocacion, went forth and
preached the gospel, nothing doutyng but he that sent them, would provide
for them. For what master can find in his heart to se his servants lack?


Chri. This is very confortable for the true Preachers of gods word. Hereof
may they well be asserteined, that if they do their masters message
faythfullye, they shall not want, though the wicked world be never so
unthankful and nyggardely unto them.


Phil. O how confortable are these words of our savior Christ to a
faithful christen man: Math. vi.
I say unto you, be not careful for the life, what ye shall eat, or what ye
shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more
worth then meat, and the body more of value then raymente? Behold the fowls
of the air, for they sow not, neither reap, nor yet carye into the barnes,
and yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are ye not much better then they?

Which of you (though he took thought therefore) could put one cubite unto his
stature? And why care ye then for raiment? Consider the lylies of the fyelde,
how they grow. They labor not, neither spyn. And yet for all that I say unto
you, that even Solomon in all his royalty was not arrayed like unto one of
these. Wherefore if god so cloth the grass, which is to day in the field, and
to morrow shall be cast into ye furnace, shall he not much more do ye same unto
you, o ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought saying: what shall we eat,
or what shall we drink, or where with shall we be clothed? After all these things
seek ye gentiles. For your heavenly father knows that ye have need of all
these things. But rather seek ye first the kingdom of god, and the
ryghteousenes thereof, and all these things shall be cast unto you. Behold
what goodly and natural examples our savior christ brings forth here, that
he may allure us to trust only on gods providence, and not to be careful for
the necessaries of this life, which are not gotten by painful travail, but
received of gods mere liberality. And because we should not be careful for
meat, he first sets before our eyes the fowls of ye air for an example,
who^ seeing god the father feeds so plenteouslie yt they want nothing, when
they neither sow nor reap, nor cari in to the barnes, much more will he
feed us, and send us what soever is necessary for the preseruacion of this
our natural life, if we call on his holy name, and live according to our
vocacion. If he fedeth the birds because they be his creatures, which
notwythstandyng so once dye, that they never live after, much more will he
provide for us, which are not only his creatures, but also created after his
own Image, endued with an immortal soul, and made unto this end, that we
should set forth his glory, praise his blessed name: and after the general
resurreccion, our bodies and souls being knytte together, live with him in
glory worlds without end, as his lawefull heirs, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. And as touching our apparel, to dissuade us from thought taking for
that, he byddeth us consider and diligently mark the lylyes and flowers of
the field, which although they neither labor nor spynne, are so clothed with
fine and pleasant colors, that not King Solomon in all his royalty and
glory was apparelled like unto one of them. If God so decketh the transitory
flower, which this day is in the field pleasauntly growing, and to morrow
shall be cut down and cast into the furnace, how much more will he send us
conueniente apparel for our bodies, which though they once dye, yet shall
they rise again, and for ever live with God in eternal glory?

Christ therefore concludes, that all these things shall be cast unto us, if we
seek the kingdom of god and the ryghteousnes thereof. Let us seek heavenly
things, and things worldly shall abunde unto us. Let us labor to garnishe
our minds with virtues, and god will not suffer our bodies to peryshe for lack
of transitory things. Psalm. cxxxvi.
For god is the lord which gives meat to al flesh. Psalm. cxlvii.
He gives, as the Psalmographe says, fode to the cattle, and fedeth the young
ravens that call upon him. He fedeth ye Turk, the Saracen, the Jew, and all
the rabble of Infidelles for their creacion sake, and for his mercies sake. He
therefore will not leave them that be his faithful people unprovided, socourles
and destitute of help. He gives the vile worms of ye earth not only their
being, but also where of to live: he therefore will not se the faithful man lack,
which is made like unto his own similitude and image. Let us therefore never
despair either of fode, or of apparel. God gave us the life, god will preserve
the life. God gave us the body, god will clothe the body. Away therefore with
careful pensiuenes, and pensive care. Let us cast our eyes on gods most holy
and infallible providence, which is certain and never fails. Luke. xii.
Take heed and beware of covetousness, says our savior christ, for no man's
life stands in thabundaunce of the things, which he possesses.


Euse. I beseech god give us all grace so to do.


Theo. Amen good lord, I most heartily beseech the.


phil. Furthermore that we should be certain of corporal necessaries, Math.
vi.
Christ our Savior has commanded us in that prayer which we co^momlye
call the Pater noster, and so likewise taught us, that we should axe our
bodily sustenance of our heavenly father. This would he not have done without
doubt, if he had not ben certain, that according to our requests our heavenly
father will deal with us, and give us our desires.


Chri. Of whom should the child crave but of his father?


Phil. Again to make us thorowli assured of this thing, what comfortable
promises have we in ye holy scriptures? (...). vii.
Axe and it shall be given you: Seek and ye shall find: Knock and it shall be
opened unto you. For who soever axeth receives, and he that seeks, finds,
and to him that knocks it shall be opened. Is there any man among you, which
if his son axed him bread, would offer him a stone? Or if he axed fyshe, would
he profer him a serpente? If ye then which are evil, can give to your children
good gifts, how much more shall your father which is in heaven, give good
things to the^ that axe him? Mark. xi
What soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye shall have it, and it shall
be done unto you. John. xvi.
Uereli, verily I say unto you, what soever ye shall axe the father in my name,
he will give it you. Axe and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. The
lord is at hand, Philip. iiii.
says. S. Paul. Be not careful, but in all things show your peticion unto
god, in prayer, and supplicacion, with geuinge of thanks. Many other most
sweet and confortable promises have we in the holy scriptures, wherbi we be
assured to obtain of god, what soever we axe of him being agreeable to his
most holy will. i. Ihon. v.



Euse. To axe necessaries for our living, is according to gods will.


Phile. Truth. For God has commanded us so to do, and promised that he will
hear us.

Jacob and Solomon, ^ene. xxviii.
as the scripture witnesses, ^roue. xxx.
axed of god necessaryes for their living, and were heard.


Chri. Although we ought to depend on gods providence, and by strong faith
and fervent prayer look for all good things at his hand, yet may not we be
idle, and lie wide open, gapyng when godwyll put meat into our mouths like
careless swyne.


Phil. God forbid. (...). v.
For as the holy man Job says: A man is borne to labor, eue^ as the bird is
to fly. From the beginnynge, god appointed man to labor, ^ene. iii.
saying: In the sweet of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread, until thou
return unto the earth, whence thou wast taken: For earth thou art and unto
earth shall thou return. ^sal. cxxviii.
David also says: Thou shall eat the labors of thine own hands. ^essa. iii
The holy apostle Saint Paul gives a commandment, that if any man will not
labor, the same should not eat, and gives a charge that all men work with
quietness, and eat their own bread. We beseech you brethern, says he, that ye
study to be quiet, ii. Tessa. ii^^
and to meddle with your own business, and to work with your own hands, as
we commanded you. Ephe. iiii.
Again, let him that stole, steal no more, but let him rather labor with
his hands some good thing, that he may have to give unto him that needs.
Saint Paul calls it theft for any man to live of the labor of other men's
hands, idelly and without any certain vocacion, and commands that all such
should labor and get them some honest occupacion, whereby they may be the more
able both to find them selves, and also to distribute unto other, Gene. iii.
that have need. Our first father Adam toyled in the earth according to gods
commandment, and so ga^ his living. ^nt. iiii.
Cain was a plowman. Abel was a shepeheard. Iuball exercised musycke.
Thubalcain was a smyth, and a grauer in metal. No he was a planter of
vineyardes. Abraham, ^^ne. ix.
Lot, Isaac, and Jacob were plowmen and shepeheardes. Joseph was a Magistrate,
(...) xiii. xxvi. (...). x^^.
and a public minister in the common weal of Egipte under king Pharao. ^odi.

Moses was a Shepehearde, and kept the sheep of Iethro his father in law,
^od. i.
Priest of Madian. The Children of Israel got their living with hard and
paynfull labor in Egypt under King Pharao. Reg. xvi
David before he was anointed King of Israel was a shepeheard. All the
Priests and Levites of the old law, ^od. xxviii.
every man according to his vocacion labored by geuynge attendaunce in the
temple, by kyllinge of beasts, and offering sacrifices, Luke. i.
by studyinge the Scriptures of God, Mala ii.
and teachinge the same unto the people. Amos. i.
etce. Amos the Prophet, was one of the shepeheardes at Therna. Daul. xiiii.
Abacuch the Prophet travailed in husbandry. Mark. vi.
Christ him self was a carpenter. Math. iiii.
The Apostles of Christ were fyshers. Paul labored with his own hands, and
gat both his own living, Acts. xx.
and others that were with him. Saint Luke was a Physician, Collo. iiii.
and as some writes a Paynter also. Aquila was a maker of tents, of the which
occupacion Saint Paul was. Acts. xviii.


Simon, Acts. x.
Sayncte Peter's host was a Tanner. Acts. ix.
Dorcas that virtuous womanne made garments with her own hands, and gave
them to the poor.

There was no good and godly man even from the beginning of the world, which
has not practiced su^what to get his living, and lived in some certain
honest and godly vocacion, wherein he might with a good conscience eat his
bread.

The Magistrate is called of god to rule with the temporal sword, to be
gouernoure of the people, to promote gods word, to noryshe the preachers of
the same, to exercise justice, to defend the wydowe and fatherles, to conserve
the common weal, to banyshe all false religion out of his realm, and to seek
the quietenes and commodity of his subjects, even as a father seeks the
health and profit of his natural son. The spiritual minister is appointed
of God to rule with the sword of the spirit, which is the word of god, to
rebuke sinners with the law, yea and to excomunicate them, if they be obstinat
and will not repent, to conforte and cheryshe the weak with the sweet promises
of the holy scripture, to encorage the strong, and to exhort them to go
forward until they wax ancient, and be perfect in Christ's religion, to
minister the sacraments, to make colleccions for the pore, to mayntein
hospitality, for the relief of the nedie. The subject is called of god to
obey, and to be in subieccion unto his superiors, and every one of them is
bound by the commandment of god, to live in their vocacio^. The Lawer, in
pleadyng and defending poor men's causes: The Shomaker, in making shoes, the
Tailour, in making garments, the Merchaunt, in occupyinge merchandise
faythfullye and truly, the Scholemaster, in bringing up his scholars godly and
virtuously, the Father of the household, to provide for his family, the Mother
of the household, to look upon things perteyning to the house, and to see her
family well governed, and so forth in all other persons, in what soever state
God has called them. Every man in his vocacion ought to labor, and by no
means to be idle. And who so does, God will bless his labors, and send
him wherewyth abundauntlie to live.


Theo. The wise manne says: the slugherde ploweth not for cold, ^roue. xx.
wherefore he beggeth in herueste, and gets nothing. He that gathers in
heruest, is a wise son: but he that is idle in somer, is the son of
confusion. Again: He that tylleth his field shall be satisfied, but he that
is idle, shall suffer honger. ^ro. xxviii.



Philemon. God in deed has promised to feed us, but yet so, that we our
selves labor for our living. God has promised us salvation in Christ
Jesus, yet so, that we believe his promise, and labor to the uttermost of our
power, to frame our lives according to his blessed will.

David says not only, Psalm. xxxvii.
Spera in domino, trust in the Lord, but he adds unto it, et fac bonitatem,
and do good. All our affiaunce and trust, must be reposed in God, and all
good things must be looked for at his hand, yet must we do that lies in our
power concerning all those things that we desire to obtain of God.

Therefore Christ says: Math. vi.
Take no thought. He says not, labor not. The pensive care and thought
taking for our living, wherwyth the Heathen be so greatly disquieted, we must
cast away from us, and lay it upon God, which cares for us: but as for
labor, which is laid upon us of God as a Cross for our sin, and
disobeience in Adam, we may not refuse, every man in his vocacion, but
ioyfullye take it upon us, and give god thanks, that by such means without
our care and thought taking, he will feed us according to his word. For what
are all our pains, labors, and travails, if god bless them not? sal.
cxxvii.
as the Psalmograph says: Except the lord build the house their labor is but
lost that build it. Except the lord keep the city, he watches but in vain
that keeps it.


Chri. Me think the occasion of this dearth, wherwyth we are now oppressed, is
not so greatly to be ascribed unto the covetousness of certain gredye gripes,
as unto our own selves, unto our ungodliness and dissolucion of life, which
so live, as though there were no God at all, so behave our selves, as though
there were neither heaven nor hell. They which have the gospel swymminge in
their lyppes, so live clean contrary to the doctrine of the gospel, as though
there were no gospel at all. In ambicion, in pride, in covetousness, in envy,
in malice, in wa^tonnes of life. etc. they give place to none. Another sort
are so drowned in papistry, in supersticion, in hypocrisy. etc. and burn with
such an immortal hatred against gods word, that they can neither abide that
(otherwise then it shall serve their fancy) nor the preachers of it, nor yet
such as a uaunce it. Can God do any otherwise then send his plages, where
such impiety and ungodliness reign? It comes from gods great mercies, that we
be not consumed, and handled as Sodom and Gomorre. But our own damnacion
slepeth not, if we do not both shortly and earnestly repent and amend.


Phil. Truth it is in deed, that god many times sends the plage of famyne
into the world for sin, as it came to pass in the time of that most wicked
an idolatrous king Achab, and at diverse other times. ^ute. xxviii.
And Moses that most excellent Prophet of God, says: If thou will harken
diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god, to observe and do al his
commandments, which I command the this day, the lord will set the up on
hie above all nations of the earth. And all these blessings shall come on
the, and overtake the, if thou wylt harken unto the voice of the Lord thy god.
Blessed shalt thou be in the town, and blessed in the fields. Blessed shall
be the fruit of thy body, the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy
cattle, the fruit of thy oxen, and thy flocks of sheep. Blessed shall thy
almerye be and thy store. Blessed shalt thou be both when thou go out,
and blessed when thou come in. etc. The Lord shall command the blessinge to
be with the in thy store houses, and in all that thou setteste thine hand to.
etc. The Lord shall make thee plenteouse in goods, in the fruit of thy body,
in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground. etc. The Lord
shall open unto thee his good treasure, even the heaven, to give rain unto thy
land in due ceason, and to bless all the labors of thine hand. etc. But
and if thou will not harken unto the voice of the Lord thy god, to keep and
do all his commandments and ordinances, which I command thee this day,
then all these curses shall come upon the, and overtake the. Cursed shalt thou
be in the town, and cursed in the field. Cursed shall thine almery be, and
thy store.

Cursed shall the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land be, and the
fruit of thy oxen, and the flocks of thy ^hepe. And cursed shall thou be when
thou goeste in, and when thou go out. And the lord shall send upon the
famine, honger and going to naught in all things that thou set thine hand
to, until thou be destroyed and brought to naught quyckely, because of the
wyckednes of thine inuencions, in that thou haste forsaken the lord. And the
heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under
thee, Iron. And the Lord shall turn the rain of thy land unto powder and
duste, even from heaven shall they come ^oune upon thee, until thou be brought
to naught. etc. Thou shalt carrye much sede out in to the field, and shalt
gather but little in: For the vermin shall destroy it. The Prophet Esai also
says: Esai. i.
If ye be loving and obediente, ye shall eat the good things of the earth.
But if ye be obstinate and rebellious, ye shall be devoured with the swerd. For
thus the lord has promised with his own mouth. These sentences, with many
other in the holy scripture ^d^ euidentlye show, that the plage of famine and
honger is sent unto us of god for our sins.


Euse. It is convenient therefore, that we all harken to the admonicion of God
given by the Psalmographe, Psalm. lxxxi.
which is, that there be no strange God among us, nor that we worship any
other God, but him alone, which only is the lord our god that delivered us
out of the spiritual Egipte, that is, from the servitude and tirannye of
Satan. If we so do, God promises that he will give us what soever we ask of
him. He will feed us with the finest wheat flower, yea and satisfy us with
honey out of the stony rock. But to obtain of God this abundaunce and wealth,
we may worship, and have no strange gods. These strange and new found
gods, are not only idolles and maumettes made of wood or stone, which in times
past the simple and folyshe ignorant people worshipped as gods, but the
abominable vices, which reign so commonly now among us, I mean covetousness,
pride, ambicion, glotonie, lechery, malice. etc. These are strange gods.
These must we put out of our breasts, if we will have god merciful and
liberal unto us.

For is this reasonable for us to serve strange gods, and to give over our
selves as bond slaves to them, and yet to require our wages and reward of the
true and only living God? What fellowship has righteousness with
unrighteousness? ii. Cor. vi.
What company has light with darkness? What concord has Christ with Belial?
Either what part has he yt believes with an infidel? How agrees the temple of
god with idolles? Roma. vi.
Know ye not says.s. Paul how that to whom soever ye commit your selves as
servants to obey, his servants ye are to who^ ye obei, whether it be of
sin unto death, or of obedience unto ryghteousnes? Every one yt does sin,
is the servant of sin, John. vii^
says Christ. We must first of al be gods servants, before we flatter our
selves with the obteyning of the good things promised by god, or else we
deceive our selves. If we be once the servants of god, and faithfully continue
in his service, then may we be bold to axe of him our wages, and to persuade
our selves, that all the confortable Histories and sentences, which we read
in the holy scriptures, perteine unto us, otherwise we have no more to do with
them, then the Turcke or the Jew. And if we receive any good thing at the
hand of god being not his servants, we receive it as all other Infidelles
do, unto our damnacio^.


phil. I confess neighbor Eusebius all this to be true, which you have now
spoken. Neither meante I by talking so much of gods gentleness and liberality,
and by alledgeynge all these confortable histories and sentences, to stablyshe
the Idolaters in their Idolatry, the wicked in their wyckednes, the covetous
worldlynges in their couetousenes, the proud in their pride, the lecherous in
their lechery, the idle bellies in their idleness. etc. and yet notwythstanding
to look for all those good things at the hand of god, which belong unto his
sernauntes, as he witnesses by the Prophet, Esai. lxv.
but to declare for your conforte and mine, that so many as give them selves
over to God, believe in him, fear him, serve him, and live according to their
vocacion, shall never peryshe for honger, but at all times have what soever is
necessary for them. And if any should chance to famishe (which seldom or
never happens) God suffers them so to do, partly that he may the sooner call
them unto his glory, partelye, that their death may turn unto the greater
dampnacion of such unmerciful monstures, as suffered the servants of god to
peryshe for honger.


Theo. We know your godly entente, brother Philemon, neither does our
neighbor Eusebius otherwise take the matter. And I for my part thank you
right her tely for your godly admonicions, freely confessinge that I am much
edified by your talk, and strongly enarmed against the darts of poverty and
honger, when soever they shall go about to oppress me.


Christo. We all confess no less.


Euse. I spoke that I spoke, to this end, that men should not flatter them
selves with the sweet and confortable promises of god, when they live in all
wyckednes, and abhominacion, which promises perteyne not unto them, but unto
the faythefull servants of god, which shall enjoy no less at the hand of
god, then he has promised. If they will enjoy the like commodity, they must
do the like seruise. They must away with their strange and new found gods,
I mean, pride, couetousenes, gluttony, whoredom, malice. etc. and serve the
only true, and living God.


Philemon. Well neighbors, to knyt up our talk with few words, ye have
heard how beneficial God is to them that put their trust iu him, and live
according to their vocacion: so that those that be faytheful need not to
despair of comfort, seem the scarsenes of things so great, that it brings
present death almost with it. For in that dearthe and penurye, the faytheful
man that casts his care on God, and hangs wholly on his fatherlye
providence, Psalm. xxii.
may well say with the Psalmograph. If I walcke in the mids of the shadow
of death, I will not be afraid of any evil, for thou art with me. God is
ever present with his people in all their tribulacion, Psalm. xci.
and he will undoubtedly deliver them, and save them harmles. This now
remains, that when ye come among the poor neadye Christians, ye conforte
them with these sweet scriptures that ye have heard, which without all doubt
shall greatly stir and quiet their minds, and refrain them from attemptyng
any unlawful redress of things after this. Again, according to your
ability, releue their poverty with your riches.

Exhort your rich neighbors likewise to be beneficial to the poor, as the
faithful stewardes of God, remembrynge that unto that end god has endued them
with their possessions. Pray unto god that he may give unto the couetouse
worldlynges, a merciful and liberal heart, that after this they may no less
wyllynglye seek the profit of their neighbors, then hitherto they have
sought their own private lucre, and singular commodity. To conclude, pray
unto god, that every one of us may so live, and so frame our life according
to his will, that he may vouchsafe to bless us, and send us necessaryes for our
living, that we may the more frelye, and with the more quiet minds, serve him
in holiness and ryghteousnes all the days of our life. Luke. i.
Well neighbors, I pray you take the pains to come into the parlour with
me. Ye shall take your part of such homelye fare as I have. And I pray yon
be no strangers: The ofter ye come the more welcome shall you be.


Euse. We thank you most gentle neighbor Philemon, and praised be the lord
for your godly and confortable exhortacions. Chri.


AMEN.
Give the glory to god alone.
