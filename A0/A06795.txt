The discontened married Man. OR, A merry new Song that was pend in foul
weather, Of a Scould that could not keep her lips together.
To the tune of, She cannot keep her etc.




A Young man lately wedded was
To a fair and comely creature;
She was a blithe and bonny Less
As ere was framed by Nature.
With rolling eye,
And forehead high,
And all good parts Nature could give her:
But she had learned such a note,
She could not keep her l. together.
A lusty youth of Cupids strain,
That might the Queen of Love contented:
Came unto her, her love to gain,
And freely she her love consented.
But to be short,
In Cupids Court,
He usde her well when he came thither:
And played his part in such an art,
She could not, etc.
When her Husband he heard tell
Of her tricks with true relation,
He complained to himself
Very sadly in this fashion.
Quoth he, I would give twenty pound,
That's ten more then I had with her,
Her mother would take her home again.
And make her keep her, etc.
Son be thou of patient mind,
Let not thoughts thy fancies trouble:
For I to thee will still prove kind.
And her portion I will double.
Time and age
Will assuage,
And the fairest flower will wither,
And I such counsel will her give,
Shall make her keep her l. together.
Henceforth therefore Ille forsake her,
And her mother shall her take:
And for shame let her better make her.
Or I again will never take her.
Pure modeshy she does defile,
Besides she is fickle as the weather:
And her scoulding plainly shows,
She cannot keep her l. together.
Then I Will leave off to find another,
Though It may add unto my luster,
For brave spacious England wide
I am sure affords a cluster.
Good and bad,
Are to be had,
Jove speed me well though long I tarry
For ere that I Will have such a Mate,
I never more intend to marry.
The second part to the same tune.


She is gone a wandering forth,
Wanton wenches will be ranging
With two gallants of great worth:
Such as they affect a changing.
She is bent
To consent
For to go she knows not whether
They will teach her such a trick,
She will not keep her l. together.
To the Dancing-schoole she goes,
There she spends her hosbands treasure,
On each Shoo she wears a Rose,
For to show she is fit for pleasure.
And resort,
To Cupids Court,
And no sooner she comes thither,
She learns so much of that same sport
She cannot keep her l. together.
To the Tavern she repaires,
Whilst her husband sits and muses,
There she domineeres and swears,
It Is a thing she often uses.
And being fine
She for wine,
Will both pawn her hat and feather,
Which does show that it is true,
She cannot keep her l. together.
He Is a Coxcombe that does grieve
And knows not how to court this creature,
For he may pin her to his sleeue,
She is of so kind a nature.
She will play
Every way.
And is as nimble as a feather
But she will often go astray,
She cannot keep her l. together.
Thou that have a wife that's civil,
Love her well and make much of her,
For a woman that is evil
All the town thou see will scoff her.
Love thy wife
As thy life
Let her not go thou know not whither,
For you will always live in strife,
If she keep not her l. together.
Maidens fair have a care,
Whom you love, and whom you marry,
Love not those that jealous are
Longer you had better tarry.
For offense.
Springs from hence,
You will go you know not whether,
Till you lose both wit and sense,
And cannot keep your l. together.
LONDON, Printed for Richard Harper in Smithfield.
