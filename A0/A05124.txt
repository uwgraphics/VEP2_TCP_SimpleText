The fyftene Joys of marriage.



SOmer passed / and winter well begone
The days short / the dark nyghtes long
Have taken season / and brynghtnes of the son
Is little seen / and small birds song
Seldon is herd / in feldes or wodes ronge
All strength and ventue / of trees and herbs sote
Dyscendynge be / from croppe in to the rote
And every creature by course of kind
For socoure draws to that country and place
Where for a time / they may purchase and find
Conforte and rest / abiding after grace
That clear Appolo with bryghtnes of his face
Will send / when lusty ver shall come to town
And give the ground / of grene a goodly gown
And Flora goddess both of white and grene
Her mantell large / over all the earth shall sprede
She wynge her self / apparayled like a queen
As well in feldes / wodes / as in mede
Having so rich a croune upon her head
The which of foures / shall be so fair and bright
That all the world / shall take thereof a light
So now it is / of late I was desired
Out of the french to draw a little book
Of.xv. Joys / of which though I were hired
I can not tell / and yet I undertook
This entrepryse / with a full pyteous look
Remembrynge well / the case that stood in
Living in hope / this winter to begin
Some Joys to find that be in marriage
For in my youth / yet never acquayntaunce
Had of them but now in mine old aege
I trust my self / to forther and auaunce
If that in me / there lack no suffysaunce
which may dyspleasyr / clearly set a part
I want but all / that longs to that art
yet will I speak / though I may do no more
Fully purposynge / in all these Joys to trete
According to my purpose made to fore
All be it so / I can not well forgete
The pain / travail / besynes and hete
That some men have after they wedded be
Because their wives / want humylyte
who shall I pray / to help me to endyte
Cupyde or Uenus / which have me in dysoayne
And for my feebleness / in great dyspyte
For years passed / may not return again
Now may I speak / and show in words plain
when youth is gone / and comen is stoupynge age
Then worldly Joys / must go on pilgrimage
If I should pray / unto ymeneus
The god of wedding / to help me in this charge
Then will he bydde me go to Morpleus
The god of sleep / for he has ways large
which with his rod of leed does stere his barge
To bring for the age / unto his slepy cave
Pray him of rest / and nothing else crave
I know right well / it is but vanyte
All worldly Joy / meddled with bytternes
Therefore these feigned gods I let them be
And me betake to god / whose stedfastnes
May never fail / neither his sothfastnes
Besechynge him / that for his moders sake
He will me teache his little book to make
And with good will I shall me soon apply
This treatise out of french to translate
Of.xv. Joys / and if I might thereby
Purchase but one / my self though it be late
I would be glad / for old pains I hate
Trusty^ge to Joy / now somewhat in mine aege
As does a bird that syngeth in a cage
Now to theffecte of this translacyon
with great desire shortly well I proceed
But speak I must / by protestacyon
Touching this matter / or else good forbede
whom I beseech lowely to be my speed
Praynge also / each other manner wight
Take no dyspleasure with my words light
Here ends the prologue of the translatoure.
And the prohemye of the auctour begins.
Mine auctour writes in this prohemye
That many men / have trauayled here tofore
To she we by reason and auctoryte
That it is great wit / and wisdom more
For every manner wight / of woman bore
To live in fraunchyse / at his lyberte
Than servant to him self / and thrall to be
without constraynt / but of his neclygence
His will to folo we / and his unclean delight
As lusty folk in their adolescence
Have such desire / and so great appetyte
On Uenus bridle / for to champe and byte
Till they with love be stryken to the heart
whereby full / often they suffer pains smerte
Unto whose reason / and opinion
It may be said / and answered thus again
Man has no good wit ne entencyou
In his young time / when nature does conssrayne
Saving in Joys / and delytes vain
Of this frail world unsure and transytory
None other thing is in his memory
As thus when men in youth couragyous
with fre will end wed and lustynes
Of their desire / and mind outragyous
withouten need / but of their folysshenes
From well to woe / from Joy to heaviness
Convey them self / from all their lyberte
Nothing content with their felycyte
For where as they may freely ride or go
And at their choice / dysporte them over all
I you ensure these young men will not so
when they leest wene / than sodanly they fall
And vnconstrayned make their bodies thrall
Like to a wight that in to prison deep
without cause / all hastily does crepe
So do they often for lack of kyndely wit
And when they be within this prison strayte
The gayler comes and fast the door does shytte
which is ofyren strong / and in a wait
Helyeth often / for dread that through desayte
By night or day some should escape out
Right besyly he pryeth all about
He barreth doors / and makes sure all the locks
The strong boltes / the fettres and the chain
He sercheth well / the holes and the stocks
That woe be they / that lies in the pain
And out thereof / they shall not go again
But ever endure / in weeping care and sorrow
For good ne prayer / shall them never borowe
And specially men may call him assoted
Far from reason / of wisdom desolate
That thus his time mysse used has and doted
when he had herd / such prisoners but late
weeping waylynge / and with them self debate
Lyenge in prison / as he has passed by
And put him self therein so folysshely
This auctour says / by cause mankind delyteth
Always to have fraunchyse and lyberte
without the which / nature of man dyspyteth
Right thus in plain words speaks he
That many lords great / the which have be
And lord ships have be lost and overthrow
For taking fredomes from their subgets low
He she weth eke in manner semblable
That great cytees / with many an other town
And common people of mind unreasonable
Have been dystroyed / and suddenly cast down
Against their princes / taking opinion
Desiring fredomes / mo than here tofore
Their elders had / and thus they have be lore
By reason whereof / batayles great and werre
Have been / and many folks also slayue
Sith Ihesus deyed / was never thing bought derre
When poor subgettes on folly will pretayne
Against their prince / or else their sovereign
To move matters / not being obedynge
Such by the law ben execute and shent
Sometime the noble realm and men of France
Exempte were / and utterly made fre
By their great / prowes and valyaunce
Of the emperors / of Rome the cite
As of trybutes / for which batayles have be
Between them / and the Romans long ago
In which days I find it happed so
Upon a time / for cause that they ne were
Of france in puyssaunce / able to withstonde
The great army and the mighty powere
Of an emperor entered in their land
But for as much / as they ne would be bond
Them were lever go from that regyon
Than to remain under subgeccyon
Serving this emperor / and trybute pay
So of high courage / and their great nobles
All suddenly / these nobles went away
Conquerynge countries / such was their worthynes
And afterward returned nevertheless
Home to their land / in great prosperyre
Which they till now have hold in lyberte
Unto their own use / prouffyte and avail
Wherefore folks of many a nacyon
Living in seruage / constreyned with travail
Desired to have their habytacyon
In france / and there under domynacyon
To live in well / lyberte / and rest
Whereby it grew / sometime the noblest
Realm of the world / that known were or found.
Most fair in building / and inhabyte best
The which in treasure / and science did habounde
Then for asmoche / as they be fre at leest
Prudent in faith / in living holiest
They should their subgets / in frau^chyse keep and use
After their law / and never to refuse
Against all truth / and inconuenyent
It is certain / and nothing charytable
God knows well / the lord omnypotent
A man to have / a custom reasonable
Only for him self / right prouffytable
And for his neighbor / use it otherwise
Such usage should / all well dysposed men despise
Herofit grows that lyberte is lost
In people void / of reason and science
And thus vices and sins reygneth most
Some give to virtues little reverence
Wherein to god / do they right great offense
The common well / in generalyte
All men should love of perfyte charity
Why it is thus / a man may reason make
Who loves not his well pertyculerly
Has but a little wit I undertake
When he may have a prouffyte syngulerly
Hurtynge none other creature thereby
And will not help him self when he so may
But wylfully does cast his grace away
A fool is he / that wyttynge will go
Into a cave / a dyche / or else a pytte
Which is above / both narowe and strayte also
And all within / full wide and deep is it
So that when he therein / is fall and shytte
Out may he not / for there he must abide
As wild bestes do in forestes side
Trapped and taken / right so this crature
In like wise / through his own neclygence
Is in the dyche / where as he must endure
Like as these bestes / which gladly would go thens
Seeking the ways with all their delygence
Out to avoid / but so it will not be
Time is not then / forth of the dyche to fle
Thus one may say / and thereupon conclude
By such as in to marriage be brought
And herupon to make a symylytude
Unto the fysshe which has his pasture sought
And in a lepe / that is often wygges wrought
Is take / and out can not escape net win
But ever dwell / and tarry still therinne
The fysshe that swymmeth in the river clear
As it shall fall him often by adventure
To rail about / in places here and there
Fyndeth this lepe / the which without mesure
Beholds he with all his besy cure
And he therein / the fysshes and the bayte
Does se / supposing well in his consayte
They be in Joy and pleasure at their lust
And all about the lepe he gooth round
With great desire / having a very trust
To come to them / and when that he has found
The enter / in he gooth glad and Iocounde
And to the shynynge bayte / he hyeth fast
Whereof anon / he takes his repaste
To go again / he thinks but a Iape
For the of the lepe / assaynge besyly
A way to find / how he therout may escape
And thens depart / to other company
He boreth with his byll all hastily
His besynes / and labor is in waste
Abide a while / he shall for all his haste
Therein to dwell in woe and heaviness
And where as he has demed certainly
Before to have had Joy / and lustynes
There shall he pass his time right heuely
By men it falls thus most comenly
That put them in to marriage all day
Experyence will witness as I say
Though it so be / that folks se before
These wedded men / within the lepe enclosed
In point to droune and drenche / yet not therefore
Will they forbere / ne till they be innosed
As hounds be of bones / it is supposed
There is not one / by other can be ware
Till they be take / and holden in the snare
Thus what by folly / fortune or destene
A man may se the people every day
Demean themself / forsakynge lyberte
And shortly after that / repents they
Desiring it to have / but they ne may
At any time / unto such grace attain
And all to late / for them is to complain
Much more hereof / mine auctoure does declare
In his prologue / or that he will begin
To she we these.xv. Joys / but I must spare
By loss of time / there is nothing to win
But pouerte / vnthryftynes / and sin
Wherefore in words rude to make an end
And of these Joys to write now I entende
Some men do call these Joys sorrows great
But yet they take them well in pacyence
For of necessyte they must forgete
The care / trouble / sorrow / pain and offense
The which they suffer at the reverence
Of their wives / which they may not forsake
And though they often / mysse use their eloquence
Little regard thereto a man should take
Here ends the proheme of the auctour.
And here begins the first Joy of marriage


THe first Joy of marriage is this
As when a man oftenderyeres is
Flourynge in youth / pleasant fresshe and gay
Then in this world / nothing may him dysmay.
He other mind / desire nor appetyte
Conforte / liking / pleasure / Joy / ne delight
Has he except / how he may tie his points
To cause his hose / to sit well on his Joints
And make his vysage / and his lymmes fair
He brussheth often his goune / and other gayre
His head he combeth smothe right as him lyketh
Whereof the here is / pruneth he and pyketh
And makes him as clenly as he can
That folk may say / there gooth a goodly man
So will he sing / dance / and balades make
And upon him / mo entrepryses take
That he can do / or may atchyeue perchance
Thinking thereby / him self so to enhaunce
The fairest creature that he can espy
He will behold / with right a lusty eye
As vysynge well / where he such one may find
A Iolynet according to his mind
And when he has her fast in his demayne
Joyous he is / right merry / glad and feign
For paraduenture so the case may stand
That by his faders / or his moders land
Or by their other goods he may mayntene
His Iolynets / and go right well besene
Living in rest and ease habundauntly
Beholdynge other folks certainly
In to the bond of marriage ybrought
Than in his mind he casts and his thought
Like as the fysshe beheld the lepe / so he
Demeth / these wedded men in bliss be
Having the bayte / and pasture at their will
Whereof they may / their appetyte fulfill
Right well he sees the beatute of their wives
Supposing that they have so merry lives
With them so well appointed and arrayed
For which the sely husband has not paid
It may so be percase / at many season
Some folk will say / and she we this man by reason
That so her own fader / or hermoder
Her has arrayed / and demeth he none oder
And so this young man / torneth him about
The lepe / wherein of wedded a route
Enclosed be / and then he does enquere
Of marriage / a little here and there
Soon here upon / aryseth such a wind
And smoke / that he thereof is made so blind
That he un ware / in to the lepe is cast
Wherein he shall be kept and holden fast
And where as he was wont in time before
To sing and dance / that may well be forbore
Of points byenge / purses / or things like
Hereof shall he not need / whiles he may pyke
Upon the bayte / till he thereof be full
His besynes may cause him to be dull
Now Ioyeth he a while / and him delyteth
To do pleasaunce / right well he him acquyteth
Newly so entered / in to the foresaid gin
And for a time nothing dysmayed therein
Supposing out to go / but there yet still
He must abide / and dwell maugre his will
And to repent / there is no time ne hour
For with the sweet mete / the sauces sour
Contynuaunce will cause him to assay
Sith he can not escape by any way
And for to put his wife in such degree
As appertains of necessyte
It him behooves honest to save
Andlo may be / his wife an heart may have
Right good / desiring to be fresshe and gay
For peradventure / she this other day
Was at a feast / where she did well advise
Women of her degree / all otherwise
Than she / appointed / clothed / and arayde
Within her mind / than to her self she said
That by her birth / she ought as well as they
To be apparayled and in as good arey
So she compaceth / casting in her mind*
The day and hour / out craftily to find
To her good man / this matter to declare
But her intent to show / yet will she spare
Till she with him / at night be gone to bed
For there these wives trust well to be spedde
Of such petycyons / as they require
According to their wylles and desire
When that this wife / in bed is laid thus
Sadly she says / for love of christ Ihesus
Sir let me be in rest / for evil at ease
I am / and he which gladly would her please
Answers and says / tell me wherefore it is
That greueth you / she says great cause y wys
Have I / for ye care nothing what I say
Or show to you / in ernest or in play
He says than / why speak ye in such a wise
By god and all his saints in paradyse
She says / no myster it is that ye it knew
For when I speak to you but words few
Little account thereof or reckoning
ye make certain / demynge for other thing
Such words I have / and yet it is not so
Which causes me / often times to be woe
Truly says he ye shall tell your disease
Than answers she / sir sith it may you please
For so the I shall you tell / this is the cas
This other day at such a feast I was
The which in troth / me plased nothing well
And wherefore I shall tell you every dele
When I there was / I think it verily
There was no wife arrayed so symply
Though she were never of so low degree
As I was than / ye may believe well me
How be it sir / surely I say not this
For praysynge of my self / but so it is
I thaynke god of his mercy and grace
That I am comen / of as good a place
As any gentyl woman that was there
I me report / to such as known where
My lygnage and mine ancestres but late
Abiding were / and for mine own estate
This say I not / saving I am ashamed
That ye or else / my kynne shall be defamed
Nothing care I / of clothing what I have
So that always / your honor ye may save
And than says he / in what estate were they
At thylke feast / now tell me I you pray
Now by my troth / sith ye will know algate
She says / there was not one in her estate
Egall to me / but she a new gown had
And was than better besene and clad
Of what clothe were / these gowns says he
Of scarlet fine / of grene or perce says she
Furred right well / with menyuer or gray
With traynes long / and sleues large / so they
Had eke of read / or grene / all gyrdelles good
Hanging unto the ground / and by the rode
Their gowns were made of the newest gyse
And of the best manner / one could deuyse
But there had I upon my wedding gown
Well over worn / and of the old facyon
Which over little / and to short for me
Is waxen as ye may perceive and se
For I am grown more / sith it was made
Than at my marriage / when I it hade
For when I given was to you alone
I was but young and little of person
And so much wasted am I now for pain
Which I of late have had / that in certain
I seem now well a mother for to be
To her that might be mother unto me
And in good says so sore asshamed was I
When that I was among this company
That I ne could ne durst make countenance
And yet had I more pain and dyspleasaunce
When that a lady there / of such a place
Before them all would say unto my face
Great shame it was my clothes were so bad
And wondered why that I no better had
For which they took to me but little head
Unneth they turn them would / so god me speed
To ward me / save of their gentylnesse
Of very pity and of lowelynesse
The good man than her husband answered tho
ye know right well that we have much to do
Wherefore my love now harken what I say
Remember ye the same time and the day
When in to marriage we entered were
Plente of money / plate or other gere
We had but small right well herofye know
For which your self ye may suppose and trow
That it he houeth us now for to bye
Beds and other things hastelye
And at this time syluerne gold in store
Little have we how be it ferthermore
yet must we bye / for winning and encres
Kyne and other catelles nevertheless
In such a place / for our prouysyon
Also this other day there fell a down
The pygnon of our house / for couerture
It lacks / wherefore dame I you assure
Made must it be in haast of very need
And also other matters for to speed
I have / for which great money shall I spend
Or I may bring my works to an end
And over this certes within short space
Unto thassyse holden at such a place
For me to go it is well necessary
Because of such a plee I may not tarry
That for your land I have to pursue there
Of which as yet I may say this and swear
I have had little prouffyte or avail
But spend my goods / labor and travail
A sir she said / now wot I well that ye
None otherwise can speak but repreue me
Of my lands / this may I not abide
And in her bed / unto that other side
All hastily she turns with a groan
Saying / for gods love let me alone
For never shall I speak to you aga^^^
What devil says this man why do y(...)layne
And are so wroth / without cause resonab^^
I am not fyr / the say th / ne yet culpable
Though ye but little had / when ye me took
For diverse to me spoke / that I forsook
Of.xx. places / which would no good crave
So that they might only my body have
In marriage withouten gold or rent
My person was to them suffycyente
But so it was / that ye often came and went
And many a messenger unto me sent
By such subtle manner craft and mean
So that all other I refused clean
And had no will / any to have but you
For which great blame and maulgre have I now
Both of my lord / my fader be ye sure
And of my mother / out of all mesures
Whereof I may have hate and great dysdayne
And sir this questyon I ask again
If any woman / at this said feast there
In such a wise cladde or arrayed were
As I being to me / in like estate
Nay sir not one / I was unfortunate
Thither to come / for by saint Johan I say
The symplest gowns / that they gave a way
Unto their chamberers / were better cloth
Than is the gown / which on my body goth
On londayes / or on the holy day
So wot I not hereof what is to say
Much people good out of this world depart
Whereof great damage is / but for my part
I say / if god were pleased I should decesse
To you it would be little heaviness
For no dyspleasure / would ye for me take
But hastily get you an other make
By god says he / that is nothing well said
Such simple words / might aparte be laid
For there is nothing that I for you do
But well ye ought to take regard thereto
Turn you to me / and what thing ye like best
I shall perform / for gods sake let me rest
Says she / now sothly nothing alyeth me
And would our lord / that in like caas were ye
But never shall ye touch me after this
No shall says he / no sir she says y wys
To make all well / than thinks he and says
If I were deed I know it by my faith
Unto an other / soon would ye married be
Nay sir by him that dyed on a tree
Touching such pleasure / as I unto this day
Have had in marriage / I swear and say
During my life / that never mouth of man
Shall touch to mine / and she to weep began
Saying these words / to god I make auow
If that I knew to live here after you
I should so deal / that I before would go
The teeres fell down fro her eyes two
Thus he demands her with words fair
All be it so / she thinks the contrayre
The good man demeth than / he is all eased
But yet again / in mind is he dyspleased
Supposing / that of nature she is cold
Of body chaste / and deal with no man would
Also he troweth that she him loves well
Thus he in heart is eased every dele
Because he sees her some what weep before
He trusts that she loves him the more
Whereof he has a pyteous heart and mind
And can not be in rest till that he find
The ways how he may her content and ease
All that he can / he does her for to please
In diverse wise / with labor and travail
But all for naught / it may nothing avail
For she always a wayteth for to pyke
Upon the stroke that she before did stryke
That is to say / a new gown would she have
The which for cruel stomocke nolde she crave
She passes time / and no good will she do
But at such hour as she was not wont to
Up ryseth she / and after all that day
A cursed angry there makes she always
And not one fair word than will she speak
So in her breast the malice does she steke
Soon after this comes the second night
That she to bed must go as is it right
With her good man / and when that she is laid
In bed / than he which is not well apayde
Beholds well looks and takes keep
On her to know / whether that she wake or sleep
He well aduyseth if her arms both
Be covered well and surely with the clothe
And heleth them if need or master be
Where with anon such countenance makes she
As though she were out of her sleep a waked
Sleep ye says he / I thought ye had been naked
Nay sir she said / what be ye not appeased
Says he / no sir mine heart is little eased
Syghynge says she I thank god of his sound
I have yuoughe to live upon the ground
By god says he / dame we shall have ynowe
Of worldly goods / and nere to her he drowe
Saying I have be thought me of a thing
ye shall be at my cosynnes wedding
And ye shall have ordained as goodly gere
For you as any gentyl woman there
Certes she says / all though ye say the best
Of all this year / I will go to no feast
Now by my faith he says but yet ye shall
And what ye will demand have gown and all
What I demand she says / that is right naught
For sir so god me help that all has wrought
I ask not to be Ioly for envy
Glad would I be forsothe if never I
Out of your house but unto church should pass
Matyns to here even song and mass
I say it not ne yet no ways seche
Saving only for such ungoodly speech
As was among other which I knew
By my gossyp / whom I find ever true
For she the words hard all openly
The which she showed me full secretly
Than thinks much this poor new wedded man
And in his mind to compace he began
Considering in what caas that he stood
A new husholde having little good
And much to do he had by many a way
Not purueyed well great sommes to pay
And fyfty scutes or syxty for this gown
He must bestow / and shortly lay it down
And in his thought / cast a cheuysaunce
For there may be none other way ne chance
But that this gown nedely must be had
Wherewith and other gere she shall be clad
For he perceived has / by his advise
His wife a woman is / both good and wise
He thanketh god / the lord of heaven bliss
So fair a Iuell / to give him as she is
From one side to an other / he turns often
In bed he slepeth not though he lie soft
And it may happen so / his wife this sees
Which subtle is / and she within her teeth
Will laughe / when that she knows his conceyte
whom she has overcome / with her deceyte
After this night / when comen is the morrow
Aryseth up this good man full of sorrow
All overcome with syghes / that he has take
The night before / for his good wives sake
And in adventure to the market gothe
With pawn or credence / for to by the clothe
And straytly unto merchants he him byndeth
Or else to them such Iuelles as he fyndeth
Whether they be of silver / or of gold
Which he sometime had / of his fader old
Then sells he / or else.x. pound or more
Of rent in mortgage lays he therefore
Shortly this man / does so his matters speed
That he has all such things as in that need
Where with he comes home all spedyly
And to have thank he demeth verily
She syenge this / made semblaunt him before
As though such cost might well have been forbore
And that nothing / she set by gown ne gayre
That he home brought with him for her repair
Cursynge all them with tongue / and not with thought
That first so great estate and port up brought
And when she knew that thing was sure she said
To her good man and him besought and prayed
He never should reprove her of the day
That she had made him spend for her array
His money or his goods / and neuermore
Her to rebuke / or else vmbrayde therefore
For by the gown set I nothing she says
So that I may me keep from cold in faith
And always have one penny in my purse
Which will suffyse to me though it were worse
Anon was made this gown / and eke an hood
Also a gyrdell which was rich and good
And now are comen the terms and the hours
when that he must content his credytoures
And this poor man not able is to pay
Because his gold and silver ben away
And longer will they not forbere this man
But execute in all the haast they can
They curse on him / and she the same perceyueth
And thereof all the circumstaunce conceyueth
And perauenture before this curse proceed
Or else after the law does him sorbede
In church to be / wherefore his company
Men will esche we and grudge all utterly
Having dysdayne with him to drink and ete
And he but little has and none can get
Of money out of danger him to bring
God wot what Joy he has in his living
His wife goth cryenge in the house about
Where with a noise she makes and a showte
And thus she says / ha cursed be the hour
That I was ever in my moders boure
Forth brought or borne / alas it had not happed
That in the cloth / wherein I was first lapped
I had be buried / for never so great shame
Betydde to any woman ne dyffame
As to me and my kynne / now shall belayd
Alas I labor sore / and fast she said
And all the labor business and cost
That I have done of many a day is lost
In twenty places or moo I had be married
If I so would / but like a fool I tarried
For where I might great honor and avail
Have had / and richesse / thereof now I fail
I know how that their wives be bysene
That would have married me / which does me
And therefore have I heaviness and woe
That death the life nyll take my body fro
Thus she complayneth her withouten care
Of her husband / or how the good man fare
For holy she has set her mind upon
Her own estate / and shortly she is gone
Unto this marriage / and where she should
Have thought upon her husband she ne would
But to this poor man puts all the wit
Like as an horse that can both plain and byte
This woman does / and she is cause of all
For she this man has made so bestyall
Some what for sorrow / or else wise by play
That well nygh wasted is his wit a way
So that he will not understand ne know
That she is in defaute / will he not trow
And though he se the matters euydent
yet of necessytee he is content
But of the thought and sorrows to enquere
It is but waast / sith ye the causes here
Of this man which can neither rest ne sleep
That thinks every hour and takes keep
How that he may in ease this woman set
And find some remedy to pay his debt
But yet is he more angry for his wife
Which curses him / than all that other strife
Thus soroweth he / in pouertee down fall
And from that pain recover never shall
Prycked he is / but smarte can he none feel
That all is Joy / to him it seems well
Thus is this man within the lepe yclosed
And parauenture so he is dysposed
That he nothing thereof does him repent
For if that he out of the same were hent
Soon would he go again in to that gynne
And all his pain and woo newly begin
yet should he never be in so good cas
As he has been before he married was
And there this poor man shall use his life
Ending his days in wretchedness and strife
Thus ends the first Joy of marriage.
Here begynnes the second Joy of marriage.


AS for the second Joy of marriage
It is when yt this wife of her courage
Feleth that she so rychely is arrayed
In such a wise as here tofore is said
And knows well enough yt she is fair
Than will she go from home to take the air
To many feestes and assembles eke
And also holy saints for to seek
On diverse pylgrymages will she go
All though the husband be not pleased so
Her Journey enterpryseth she to ride
With her cosyon and gossyppes at a tide
And specially for her kynnesmannes sake
Her pylg^^^^^ devoutly will she take
And perauenture yet it may so be
That this man is as nyghe kynne unto we
As unto her / but so him for to call
wont and accustomed is she ouerall
It may be thought for some intent or cause
She calls him so / but there I leave a clause
Her mother than seeing her business
Comes sometime to this man I guess
And as a woman can begin to clatter
She says his heart to tycle and flatter
This foresaid man / her cosyn is of blood
For her to go with such a company is good
And other while the husband is loathe
That she should go / says sadly by his oath
How he none horses has ne other thing
Her to convey to feast or gaderynge
Than shall the gossyp or her cosyn say
I am right loathe by god and by this day
To go / for mine house so god me speed
Much thing have I to do of very need
And were it not honor to you and me
Speak would I not as now so mote I the
For sir so god me help I know it well
your wife to go is pleased never a dele
She is a woman leest that loves waast
Of any living / for ever she does haast
Home ward when she at any place is out
For your expense and charge she has such doubt
So this good man / whose wisdom is to seche
And sore abused with their flaterynge speech
Demands who goth in this campany
Of men and other / and she says certainly
My cosyon and my godfader also
My god mother and many an other mo
your mother in law / which is your wives mother
My good cosyn your wife / and diverse other
Also the wives of such a place in deed
And your cosyn and hers have ye no dread
Other there be mo / dwelling in your street
I dare well say this company is mete
A kings daughter for to be among
And be ye sure she will not tarry long
So is this sely man on honor set
That in no wise will he this vyage let
And perauenture she that thus does speak
Shall have a go wne or other things to break
The matter that the person may be played
And thus it falls often as it is said
He says this company is good and fair
But she much has to do / and great reparre
At home how be it / for to goo as than
She has a license given by this man
which to her says / be ware how by the days
ye be demeaned trauaylynge on your ways
Also take heed at night ye lodge you sure
And god you keep from evil adventure
The good wife than / which does perceive and here
That she has leave / makes countenance and chere
At home for to abide yet had she lever
Than forth to ride / and from her home dysseuer
She says my love this time no cause have I
Out for to goo with such a company
I pray you that I may not goo this season
Her cosyn than was nyghe herynge that reason
Answered and said / what cosyn ye shall goo
your gentle husband will that it be so
The good man than a little abacke does draw
And thus he says unto his mother in law
Ne were it for the trust I have in you
She should not go / this make I god auow
Ha my good sone she says by heaven king
That made this world / and every other thing
ye may as surely and withouten dread
Suffer her to go as for to say your creed
Thus they depart and on their way be gone
And as they go / these words than says one
Unto an other he has some Ialousye
It seems well he dredeth Ieopardye
Thus is he mocked by these women's art
For now come galauntes forth on every part
which at the feast before by adventure
This foresaid work have made and put in ure
And there awaytynge ben upon their need
For to conclude and so forth to proceed
But how this wife now fested is and served
For love of her good man all undeserved
And god wot how she does herself apply
To revel dance / and for to sing on hye
Also she makes good and merry chere
But god wot how she prayseth her bedfere
The husband left at home while she is out
And sees herself so praised among the route
Certes these galauntes than her do advise
And se she is apparaylled in such wise
Perceiving well her chere and countenance
Shortly to hex each one him does auaunce
One profreth much / an orher offreth more
Hard is to me the cause to tell wherefore
The Ioly chere the praty trotte and pace
with the demeanynge of a woman's face
Will give these lovers cause and hardynesse
To sewe for grace unto their worthynesse
One to her words gracyous does say
And other come^th asnygh her as he may
And sets his foot a lofte on hers plain
Eke by the hand quyckly he does her strain
Also an other his look casts a side
Full pyteously and sharply for a tide
An other than unto her does present
A dyamonde right fair and oryente
Or else a rich rubye with a ring
Which she receives with some other thing
By which things may she well understand
Of their intent / and feel it with her hand
If she have any reason brain or wit
And other whiles by fortune happeth it
That from her chair alyght will she adown
To do some works of devotion
Or unto Uenus to do sacrefyse
But how can I not say ne in what wise
This sely man at home in poor degree
Is made and brought unto necessytee
For thylke estate that his wife does pretend
The matter thus has driven to an end
And made her go to gaderynges and feestes
Among a wicked company of gestes
For unto her they yolden be in trust
To have their pleasures appetytes and lust
Upon none other thing do they aweyte
But how they may do this poor man deceyte
The stroke whereof he has without escape
Which comynly is called but a Iape
So he is causer of his propre shame
None other wight thereof is for to blame
And thus it happeth by contynuaunce
That what by sygnesspeche or countenance
Troth of the thing whereof he was in doubt
All openly reported is about
Whereby he falls Ialouse in a rage
Out of the which there is no wight so sage
That him can move / for who that fervently
Of woman feleth the cruel malady
There is no medycyne that may him cure
The sickness is so sharp without mesure
Than will he beat her bytterly and curse
Whereby the works makes he much worse
For chastyce can he not by day ne night
His wife but by his betynge makes light
And hot the love bytwne her and her friend
Thus dryueth he the matter to an end
And so he other whiles fortune may
One of her lymmes break or kytte a way
Whereby his castle or his pyle he loses
Than as a mased be he him dysposyth
Withouten care and all he sets at naught
Thus has he found ye pain which he has sought
And never after will she love him more
Because that he has beten her so sore
But for to pass the time and make a she we
And of fair words speaks she but few
There this poor man in turment pain and woe
Lives and yet he thinks not so
And all these soro was / he for Joys does take
So in the lepe he is I undertake
Enclosed deep / and yfhe were without
Yet shortly would he in withouten doubt
There uses he his life in pains always
And wretchedly / thus ends he his days
Thus ends the second Joy of marriage.
Here begins the third Joy of marriage.


ANother Joy which named is the thrydde
Of marriage in no wise may be hid
The which I purpose shortly to dclare
According to mine auctour and not spare
The which is when man in youth does wedde
A young maid / and when they both in bed
Have had their pleasures largely and desire
And well aswaged is the brennynge fire
The hoot heruest is well ouerblowe
As it with me and other is I trow
Soon after this her belly does arise
And waxes great / as is the common gyse
Whereof the husband always has the name
And perauenture he nothing to blame
Is of the deed / for so it happeth often
As some men say in preuy counseyllsofte
And thereat meryly will laughe or hum
But this is de secrets mulierum
The husband than in to such thought does fall
And turmentes that he run and trotte shall
To get the wife all she shall need
Forth on his Journey swyftely does he speed
And if he tryppe or stomble by the way
He may fall in the mire by night or day
And great adventure shall be if he bring
Uytaylles that may be good to her liking
All though he has done never so great pain
Whiles he was out / till he came home again
And often it happeth so that for such mete
As comynly she used has to ete
Both lust and appetyte from her do pas
Because her stomach is not as it was
Than she desires to have things strange
And noueltees her dyerte for to change
For which this poor man must trotte on foot
Or else ride there is none other bote
Both night and day / to get where he may find
Such delycates as may content her mind
And in this turment seven years and more
Is this good man / and yet she evermore
Nothing will do but play the wanton so
That thereof pity has this husband tho
Which of the house always the charge does bear
And se all things well ordered every where
Erly to rise / and late to goo to bed
He must and se all matters be wellspede
And on his husholde / after such estate
As he is of remembers he algate
Now does the time approach of trauaylynge
And she a child in to the world shall bring
God faders than in haast / god moders eke
As she will order / besyly to seek
He has great thought and out goth in an hete
The nourysses and gossyppes for to get
Which must her keep of child while she lies in
What time his double sorrow does begin
For so they drink the wine in every hour
As in to old botes one did it pour
Now lyenge in her travail pain and woe
This wife auoweth twenty way and mo
On pilgrimage to go for her good speed
To be put out of her great pain and dread
This poor man auoweth eke for toryde
Unto all halowes / and now on every side
The gossyppes come / and this good man must get
Such vytayles as they may well drink and ete
So that they may in such a wise be eased
As they shall hold them well content and pleased
This done / the wife and gossyppes talk together
And fast they carye in for dread of weder
All be it so / this good man has the pain
That travail must in wind snow hayle or rain
And when he is forth passed on his way
One of the gossyppes will these words say
Alas my gossyp which now is without
An hard fytte has / that am I out of doubt
A foul and evil weder now it is
No force an other says so have I bliss
He is right well at ease / and so be we
But if it fortune so / sometime that he
Fail of such thing as were unto their pay
One of the gossyppes to the wife shall say
Gossyp I marvel much / and so does all
This felawshyp / that it so is befall
And we have wonder what it may amount
That your husband does make so little count
Of you or of your young child here in truth
A gentle heart would pity have and routhe
Behold it well / conceive what he would do
if ye had children five or six yet mo
It does appear he leuoth you but lyte
Whereof both ye and we may have dyspyte
Consydred where ye lust him for to take
He has more honor truly for your sake
Than ever any of his lygnage bore
Have had in days passed heretofore
By god I say / that is our lord Ihesus
Rather than my husband served me thus
I had well lever / either he were deed
Or else that he none eye had in his heed
Than says an other / gossyp find some bote
Let not this man thus cast you underfoot
For he shall do to you when ye be laid
As much again or more / now have I said
An other says / my cosyon I marvel
ye take no more regard to your avail
Consydred / ye be wise of good lygnage
And he not like to you / though marriage
Has coupled you and all men high and low
How ye him suffer understand and know
And he does you so great damage always
Than does the wife answer again and say
Truly my dear gossyppes what is the best
To do as in this caas so have I rest
Nothing know I ne ways find I can
To help my self he is so evil man
An evil man he is / one of them says
But I shall tell you truly by my faith
My gossyppes that be here / they know well when
I was first married to mine husband than
Men said he was so diverse of his will
That it was wonder but he would me kill
By god my gossyp though he so were named
I thank our lord he is now right well tamed
For he had lever fall and break his arm
Than me to do dyspleasure hurt or harm
But first when we together married were
To speak than he began with angry chere
And for to stryke as does a carlysshe mon
But by the sacrament of god anon
Fast with my tethe I took the brydell so
That he me bette no more, but times two
Wherein he played the very fool and more
For after was I much wors than before
And he has told my gossyp sykerly
That he in me could put no remedy
Now may I speak and do all that I will
And be it right or wrong untruth or, skyll
Always with me the last word shall remain
So when he speaks I chekke him up again
There is no game like it / which is to play
With players and put business away
For gossyp never man yet was so hard
I you eusure but yfhe be answarde
Well by his wife she shall soon make him fre
And debonarye / if that she wytty be
An other says / my cosyn be well ware
ye speak to him / and for no dread ye spare
When he comes home / and say the best ye can
And in this wise / governed is this man
Than drink they fast and say saint John^ to borowe
And take their leave unto the next moro we
What time again they will return to se
The manner all / how she shall governed be
But when this poor man comes home again
With vytaylles and with other thing certain
And sees there is great waast made in his house
Of gods and he is inly covetous
Than salleth he heaviness and pain
For thought that him does by the heart constrayne
An hour or two by night he does aryue
For he has comen far to se his wyue
And for to understand yet ferthermore
How that she does / he coueyteth right sore
Whether she be hole / or how it with her is
In any wise to know will he not mys
One night from home he dare not lodge without
Of his expense he has such fere and doubt
In to his house with Joy entered is he
And all his servants there in their degree
Instructed be and taught in such a wise
Like as the good wife list before deuyse
For else though never so good and true were they
They should not tarry there well halse a day
Now he demands how the good wife does
And thereof will he understand the soth
Than says her chamberer which does her keep
Sir she is very seek and may not sleep
Sith ye departed hens ete might she not
But little she amended is god wot
Than is this man all sorrowful and sad
Which has been wette with reyne and hard bestadde
For oftentyme by him and other moo
Parauenture it may well happen so
That he is faynte and his horse at assaye
For he has passed by an evil way
And they percas of all the day before
Have neither drunk ne eten less ne more
And yet will not this poor man ete a bytte
Till time that he may understand and wit
How his wife does / and than the chambrerere
Old matrones / and the nouryse drawn nere
And servants which enfourmed ben how they
After their charge shall them demean alwey
They she we their personages as they were wroth
Than will not he abide / but up he goth
In to the chamber / coming her again
And at his enter / softely she does plain
Upon the bed before her leneth he
Saying my bestbyloued how do ye
Right seek she says my lord / and than he there
Demands how in what a wise and where
My love says she / ye know well that oflate
I am made feeble / and in poor estate
Than answers he to her as in this wise
Have ye not ordained so that some colyse
Of a fat capon for you may be made
Now sir so god me help / right so I had
She says of late / but they it can not make
In faith quod he love I shall undertake
To make you one full well and holsomly
The which shall no man touch but ye and I
And ye shall ete it for the love of me
She says my love I will well it so be
This good man than goth to the coke in have
He stampeth fast and ordained herrepast
Fast chydeth he / and says they be but bestes
For they can dyght no metes at requests
Than hastily he does this soupynge bear
Unto this wife / and when he comes there
With prayer he enforces her to take
Somewhat thereof and ete well for his sake
And so she does and says sir good it is
But so was not that they have made or this
For it was nothing worth a simple fle
And with that word from her departs he
To souper / and adowne he does him fette
And thereupon the vytaylles be forth fette
None of the delycates that gossyppes ete
The day before / which were not for him mete
Not perauenture of the messes che^e
He had but of the fragmentes and belefe
Whereof the old wives have take their fill
And god wot in what wise they drank theyrtyll
Thus was this weary man at souper fed
Where with he is content and goth to bed
All sobrely with heaviness and soro we
And when that comen is the next inoro we
Unto his wife he gooth / and in this wise
He says / my love time is ye a wake and rise
And go to mass for we so much do spend
That all our money nygh is at an end
This cost is great / we may not bear out it
And she answers a sir it is not yet
No while sith I was laid / and so great pain
I have that yet I can not well sustain
Myself / but now I wot it and believe
Ye thing it long / and sore it does you grieve
That I ne labor in the house again
In such a wise as though I should be slain
I understand it is your mind and will
That iu this wise I should my self do kill
Alas I se in time to come that I
Right much shall have to su^^^e certainly
If that I should have x or xii. yet mo
Children / but god defend that it be so
For if it might him please I would be glad
That never one after this time I had
And please it to god that I more child have never
But his commandment be performed ever
In me and all his will lowly obeyed
Ha said this man / alas what have ye said
Ye moan yourselfe without cause or encheson
For I dare say and make it good by reoson
Was never poor man yet of mine estate
That suffer has so much as I of late
From hens forth in it shall me like and please
That when ye will ye arise or take your ease
Than says she thus / my counseyll is that one
Go straight unto my gossyppes all anon
And say to them they come no more to me
For I am evil dysposed in certaynte
My love says he they shall come and have all
Such things as may them please in special
Sir than says she / no more let me be still
And do ye all things as it is your will
Than comes a matrone with a wryngled face
An old kepster with whom is little grace
And to the good man out her mind does break
Pease sir she says / no mo such words speak
For to a woman that is void of brain
And feeble / and so tender in certain
Great peril is to speak so in her pain
And there withal she draws the courtayne
So does this man live sorowfully always
And wretchedly so shall he end his days
Here ends the third Joy of marriage.
Here begins the fourth Joy of marriage.


THe fourth Joy of marriage to tell
Is as to go front purgatory to hell
For it is when he which has married be
Keeping an household after his degree
where he has dwelled still.viii. years even
And has of young children ^^r^ or seven
Passing full many an evil night and day
Unhappely as ye have herd me say
whereof he has had many an evil end
Thus is his youth gretely made cold and spend
And it were time for him sore to re^^^te
If that he could / as sinners should in lent
But of his house which he must keep algate
He is so inly weary and so mate
That what someuer the wife will speak or do
Naught cares he / ne takes head thereto
For he as hard and dull is as an ass
which for no prycke ne sporre will faster pass
This poor man daughters has yet one or twain
The which may fortune would be married feign
They ready be and on the hour they tarry
Awaytynge fast who will come them to marye
They be in Ioye*and it may happen to
The man is poor / and lives in care and woe
Nygh moneyles / and has no great substance
For marriage to make his cheuysaunce
Also unto his sons he must bye
His daughters and his other small meynye
Doublettes hosyn kyrtels and vytayle
And many an other thing withouten fail
His said daughters he must repair and keep
All honestely and gaye / else will they weep
And for three things this nedely must be done
One is because they may be asked sone
Of diverse galauntes dwelling them about
An other is withouten any doubt
All were it so that this good man ne would
yet so to be / for nothing it ne should
For why the wife has passed the same ways
And she ne will it suffer by this day
Also there is an other reason why
Because they have good minds and hertes hye
And are accustomed to be fresshe and gay
For otherwise will they not be ne may
And in adventure if they otherwise
Entered were / anon they would practyse
To have their Iolynettes / for help and ease
But there an end / of that I hold my pease
So is this man on every part dysmayd
These charges berynge / as before is said
And perauenture so he is bestadde
That symplely and poorly he is cladde
Of which array yet cares he nothing
So he may have a pass time and living
And this suffyseth well to him always
As to the fyss he does in the lepe to play
Whiles he may have a time and suffraunce
Therein to live and languysshe ni penance
And yet thereby abbredged ben his days
So fares it by such a man always
The which in to the lepe of housholdynge
Is put where he shall suffer such turmentynge
As I have said / and other innumerable
And thus he sees these things so chargeable
That all he set at naught so he live may
As does an horse morfounded by the way
Which none account does set by sporre ne thing
That may to him be done in trauaylyage
This not withstondynge / wheder he will or not
Forth him behooves for to goo and trot
To govern land and lyuelode which is his
Right after such estate as he of is
And perauenture he has horsest wayne
The which be lene and poor for lack of grain
And it so fortune may he has but one
Or yet not one / but forth he gooth anon
And.xx. mile or forty from his place
He trauaylleth / within a little space
Unto the parlyament / or to thassyse
Where he has for to sewe in diverse wise
For such a cause*as other things among
Has been dependant in the law there long
A pair of botes well of three years old
Or four he has to keep his legs from cold
The which full often have mended ben allow
Right craftily for dread it should be know
So that part which was sometime on the kne
Amyddes the shynne must nedely used be
Full often they changed have their former face
And that has brought them from above so bace
A rustye pair of sporres he has eke
Whereof one of the rowelles be to seek
Also of.x. years old he has a gown
Not of the newest gyse ne facyowne
The which for dread that he should it appear
Except on high feestes he nolde it were
Or else when he from home should go or ride
All other times it was laid clean a side
The cause why it was of so old a shappe
May be for so it fallen is by hap
That gowns be made all in a new gyfe
But this to him does well enough suffyfe
And in his ways if that he se or here
Any Instruments or plays ay they answer
As seems him by so wynge in his ere
Of his household because his mind is there
He lives hard and poorly by the ways
So do his horses / and his page always
Which page is all to ragged and to rent
As pluto was that rode to parlyament
Upon his side a rustye sword and bad
He ware the which his master gotten had
In flaunders at a bataylle / also he
Those bowges carried that were wont to be
Often used to conueye both nygh and far
His leg harneys always in time of war
Sortely to speak / he does all that he may
With little cost to travail by the way
For he at home enough has for to spend
Also these advocates to him offend
Sergeauntes gryffyers / and such a company
So largely take of him that he does hye
Home ward as fast as he his horse can drive
And perauenture when he comes to his wyue
It is nygh the morning as the night
And when he is at home he does alyght
Where he no souper find can ne espy
Because his wife and other company
Unto their beds were gone some what before
Or he came home / but he dare say no more
But takes all in pacyence and gree
For here unto accustomed has he be
And if it hap that he come in good hour
Weary and sad with travail and labor
Pensyfe heavy / and of his charges grieved
Supposing to be welcomed and releued
How be it many times he has had
And he does think right evil chere and bad
The good wife chydeth than and clappeth fast
As though a tempest were or thonder blast
Within the house / and if that this good man
List to command / or bydde his servants than
To get him any thing that he would have
There is not in his house so lewd a knave
That makes account thereby ne will obey
So by their dame before taught ben all they
Wherefore to speak he loses time and pain
But she there with be pleased in certain
And if his ladde in any wise demand
Mete for him self / or for his horse prouande
He shall be checked and rebuked so
That he shall not dare speak such words mo
Also this poor man that is so lage
Will make no noise for hymn for his page
But takes all in pacyence and says
Dame ye do well / and yours in good faith
There with she answers him all hastily
ye have more lost and spent now folyly
Than ye will win of all these yerest way
I told you late in twenty deuylles way
ye should have made ourhenhous close or now
A martron eten has this tell I you
Three of mine old hens ye shall perceive
What harm we have thereby / thus ye deceive
By god I know yfye may live your age
ye shall be poorest man of your lygnage
Fair dame says heno mosuche words say
I have enough / and so shall have always
Our lord I thank / and if it do him please
I am content / and think me well at ease
For of my kynred there ben full right good men
In your kynred / hase now / says she then
By saint Mary / I know not where they be
And at the leest I could them never se
Dame by my faith he says / some be right good
Of my lygnage / I would ye understood
The which be worth as much or more than ye
What they / she says / be they like unto me
ye dame says he / nay sir by god says she
I tell you well your deeds were but small
without my friends help in especyall
Now fair dame / for gods love says he
Have pacyence / and let such words be
Certes she says / if that my friends were here
And you such / words had / they would answer
you well enough / then he the matter feres
Leest it by her / should come unto their eres
Wherefore to keep all things in pacyence
No more says he / but rests with silence
And here with all / begins for to weep
A little child / that can not go but crepe
And she anon / a rod takes in her hand
And in dyspyte / of this good poor husband
More than for other cause or chastysynge
Upon the buttockes / she does it beat and dynge
This little babe / and than he says no more
Beat it fair dame / and waxes wroth therefore
And she begins for to chyde and cry
In all the deuylles names of hell on hye
To govern them / she says ye have no pain
They cost you naught / but I have cause to plain
For always upon them I must attend
God give it shameful death / and evil end
Ha fair dame says he / that is foul said
with that the nouryce shortly does out brayde
And says a sir / full little do ye know
The sorrow that here is among us I trow
And what pain that it were to you / if ye
Should keep and nourysshe them so as do we
Now by my troth / than says the chamberere
It is great shame to you sir / will ye here
For when that you come home / we should be feign
Of your coming / but ye make noise and plain
And all your house / ye set in great debate
This man seeing this / and there with is chekmate
How he on every side is prycked sore
And he can get no remedy therefore
All weary gooth he souperles to bed
And if he soupe / god wot how he is fed
Or eased / after he to sleep does lie,
And hereth all the night his children cry
For wytyngly the nouryce and the mother
Do let them cry / they will it be none other
In great dyspyte of him which all the night
Does pass in sorrow / unto the days light
All these tourmentes / he for Joy does hold
For why / none otherwise he live ne would
Therefore he is / and always shall abide
In sorrow thought / and care on every side
And wretchydly his days in pain and woe
He shall endure / and make an end right so
Here ends the fourth Joy of marriage.
Here begins the fyfth Joy of marriage.


OF marayge for to declare or write
The fyfth Joy / now god would I were quyte
So little fruit or pleasure stante therein
That I am weary falfe or I begin
Which is when yt the good man which is married
Long time in travail has / and woe tarried
And many a pain endured has before
Whose youth is gretely over drawn therefore
And he is very weary faynte and mate
But by adventure it may so be algate
He has a wife more greter of lygnage
Then he / and eke more younger of heraege
The which be two great and doutfull things
To meddle with / and namely in weddynges
For better none can do himself to waste
Than in these twain / to lap or put in haste
His body / and well understand it why
For two repungnaunce / they be truly
Wherefore agaynge nature it were and right
They should accord by day or else night
And other whiles so is that he and she
Some child may have / or else that none there be
This not withstanding she is nothing set
To pain / for why / the good mau will not let
But she be kept in pleasure ease and well
Wherefore he traueyleth / and does every dele
Which is to mayntene such a Ioly state
And costyous / as she wyllkepe algate
And if she would have thing that there is not
That she may have it / he will go or trote
For she will not make lo were ne empeyre
Her lygnage by her dyete ne her geyre
The husband takes all this for honor
And thanketh god entyerly of that hour
In which he of his grace / her has him sent
So what she does or says he is content
And often time it happeth at a tide
When they begin / to vercyfy or chyde
She says to him by manner of manace
Ye know right well / of what an house or place
I comen am / and was not given to the
A drabble or else a dreuyll for to be
She says as soon / as I will send or write
Unto my kynne and friends of this dyspyte
Anon they will come hyder for tose
How I do here / and therefore dare not he
For any cause / ones touch her with his hand
With staff ne stycke / for all his goods and land
Though he with mouth / great words has ysayd.
As still he is / and muet as a maid
In bondage great / me seems that he is
And so it may well be that she or this
Had by her friends married ben aforne
Unto / a rycher man / and better borne
Than he / and in a higher state be set
If that in her had been no fault ne let
But for there was before some little Iape
That in her yought fortuned for to escape
To cole her thryst / as diverse folks well trow
She had not else ben married hafe so lo we
Whereof the husband had no knowlegynge
Or perauenture he has herd some thing
But this good man / of such faith and believe
Is made / that this thing little does him grieve
For he has herd it, said / and so worn or then
Of many folks / and of right good men
That all such cursed langage was contryued
Against his wife / and he the same believed
They say it is bostynges and auauntes
Made by the means of Ioly frsshe galauntes
And other sklaundrers that speaks shame
Of women good / and falsely them defame
When they togyders in the streets walk
Thus of good men and women will they talk
What time that they nothing may else do
Unthryfrely thus speak they ever mo
Wherein god wot / great sy^ne do they and wrongs
In such ungoodly wise to use their tongues
And if so be this wife behold and se
Her husband being in so lo we degree
That he all Joy has left / dysporte and play
Thinking to make a cheuysaunce some way
Upon her land / or else it may be fall
Of cheuysaunce he has enough at all
And is a very nygarde / and a chynche
That will not freely spend / but spare and pynche
The which no pleasant thing is to the wife
That purposes to live a lusty life
Because that she in seasons of the year
Will have these noueltees / though they be dear
As well in vytayle / gounes as atyre
Grydels and other things at her desire
Like as she sees her felawes use and were
At feestes and daunces every where
There as her cosyns / and her gossyppes be
And with an other man / that always she
Uses to call her cosyn euermo
And peradventure yet he is not so
Also somtymes well it fortune may
That for the great pleasures ease and play
She has / and sees in many a sundry wise
Dysdayne her husband she will and despise
And make a friend / such as she will desire
Her hasbande then / in water or in fire
May lie / for she will love him neuermore
Some folk would deem she were to blame therefore
But ye must take the matter otherwise
For all is long upon his couytyse
And he is sad / and in perplexyte
But she is light / and in prosperyte
Not entered into thought ne negardy*
She is but young / and so she will apply
Her youth in pleasure / lusts and delight
Aege is not mete unto her appetyte
So loving is she / to her love and kind
That to such place / as she demeth him to find
Often will she take / her Journey forth and walk
Or secretly / and softly forth will she stalk
Unto her friend / that lusty is and fresshe
For very love her lymmes to refresshe
And it may happen many times that she
Saving her worship / seldon may him se
Then for to speak her good name and honor
Her messenger she sends at an hour
That he shall come / and se her hastily
The which is done right well and honestly
Soon after this / when comen is the night
And this good man and she withouten light
Be laid in bed / and he somewhat would play
With her / whose mind is with her friend away
This gentle galaunt / whom of.viii. days and mo
She has not seen / and yet it may be so
That on the moro we he will come for his wage
All hot and hasty / hongry in a rage
For perauenture he has such a tatche
That he has morned sore / and keped watch
Both in the gardyns / also in the street
And they ne might yet of long times mete
Ne speak to gyder / but on the moro we when
This man shall come / he will be hasty than
His appetyte and h^nger to aswage
Great and wonder is / to speak of his courage
And it may fortune otherwise I trow
That they have had leyser enough to know
And so such pleasure / as a man may think
But I dare neither speak ne look but wynke
Mine auctour writes / but so will not I
That she demeaneth her right wantonly
He says an hundred things she can make
That toucheteth love / for her good friends sake
And many a token will show and sign
Of love / / the which I can not well deuyne
She makes eke melancolyes among
Which to her husband made she not of long
Also her love does besynes and pain
To do her pleasure / as he can again
So many praty Iapes he will begin
That she great Joy / and conforte has therein
And those such manner Iapes ben or play
That wedded men can not / ne will assaye
And if the can / before or that they wedde
Those they forbere / and set at naught in bed
Wherefore to she we it to a wife or teache
The which more able is to read or preche
Then for to learn percase much more than he
The good wife can in her necessyte
Therefore he will not teache her in that guyse
For she / than he more conning is and wise
Now when this wife / her love has at her will
And they have time / and leaser to fulfill
Their appetytes / such Joys as they show
Together / men have herd of but a few
For there no wight is / that can tell or say
The pleasure that have been between them twaye
And so she has had such dysporte and speed
That nothing prayseth she her husbands deed
After the which pleasures / Joy and game
As great delight / and pleasure takes the dame
Of her good man / as one that tastes wine
Which has reboyled / and will never fine
After he has drunk good wine or yopocras
And other while yet / thus may stand the case
A drynker good which has a fervent thyrste
And drynketh small and musty wynes first
He thinks them good enough / his thyrst so great
Is / and the dryenes of his mouth and hete
But after he thereof has drunk his fill
He fyndeth a cursed tarage and an ill
And if that he should draw again and taste
yet though he might / he nolde unto it haste
But in defaute of better wene it were
Right so know ye that this good wife does here
The which her lover / always has at need
At her desires / such matters for to speed
And takes a taste sometime at request
Of her husband / for lack of her good gest
To pass the time and drive the night away
But other while / when he has lust to play
And she not so / she says let me be still
Abide / and toward morning doyour will
Nay certes dame / so will I not says he
Wherefore I pray you / torn you unto me
Nay love she says / by god and by saint Mayre
ye shall do me great pleasure for to tarry
Unto the moro we / and then he torneth away
And dare not touch her ne no mo words say
So all the night / he lies still in rest
And slepeth metely well at her request
Then this good wife / that on her love does thing
Not carynge whyder her husband flete or sing
Entendeth for to se upon the morn
Hero wne love / whom she has long forborne
Says to her self / for she is not alone
My husband shall not yet touch my person
Tomoro we / and therefore erly she arose
And left her husband / routynge in the nose
And makes such a countenance as she
A houswyfe good / and houssholder should be
And peradventure the husband is in bed
Whiles that his wyfes meters is well spedde
By her good love / and she has her desire
And he content is / with his wage and hyre
Thus all that day / she is so well apayde
That neither servant needs she ne maid
In every place / so ordreth she the house
And skyppeth about / as qnyckely as a mouse
She clappeth to the doors and the wykket
And is as merry as it were a crykket
And sometime it may fortune other wise
When that she will not from her bed a rise
But like a wanton or nycet play
Then will she plain / a little before the day
And this good man does ask her what she eyleth
In truth she says / I think my heart me feyleth
Within my side / I have so great a pain
And in my belly which do me sore constrayne
That it is marvel / but as Christ me save
I deem sir that the same sykenes I have
The which wont was before time me to take
And namely when I ouermoche did wake
Torn you to me says he I you require
By god says she / I am as hot as fire
For this night have I had so sore a fytte
That little have I slepte / or nothing yet
Then this good man her clepeth with his arm
And feleth well that she is very warm
He says then / troth now say ye certainly
But she has other manner malady
Of fevers / than that she will tell or she we
For peradventure / this false wyle shre we
Thought that she was with her love in her dreme
Which made the swetynge from her body streme
Then this good man / her feeling in this hete
Does cover her from wind / lest that the sweet
Should in ward pass / all so daynly or drink
Which were a peryllous thing as he does thing
To her says he / dame keep you well and sure
Lie still in bed / while your sweet does endure
And I shall cause such works to be done
As needful is / and up he ryseth soon
Perchance withouten fire or candell light
Some what before the day / within the night
And when he so is up all hastily
He makes a fire for her / which easily
Lies in her bed / and laugheth by her self
That in the derke / he walks like an elfe
An other time / if this good man play would
With her / as I here to fore have told
She well excuses her / in luche a wise
Full often / as ye have herd me late deuyse
To escape a way / ever will she find a mean
For she his deed / not prayseth worth a been
And yet has he / great besynes y wysie
At many a time / her for to coll and kiss
But god wot how she is eased therefore
If she be such one / as is said to fore
Unto this man / the good wife will say thus
I would that it might please our lord Ihesus
ye neuermore should do / ne yet assay
Such things as ye or this have herd me say
ye should forbere / and how what would yet not
Do it your self says he / nay god it wot
Says she / for if yt ye such thing would spare
B oath ye and I should much the better fare
If I had known this or ye did me wedde
I never would have gone unto man's bed
what say ye dame / now speaks this good man
For what encheson did ye mary than
I note quod she / but when I was a maid
So as my fader and my mother said
I did / and thought she spoke such words waste
yet peradventure before she took a taste
what thing is this to say / the good man says
I found you never before this by my faith
To says truth in your entencyon
But always fast in this opinion
I wot not by my soul she says my love
This knows well the mighty lord above
Ne were it not / for your pleasure alone
Now never would I do it by saint Ihone
This man well eased is / as god it would
And to him self he says / my wife is cold
whereof he makes none account ne tale
And peradventure she is white or pale
Of nature feeble / and complexcyon
But he has her / in his subieccyon
And her he clepeth / and he kysseth so
That all his pleasure / has he or she go
And this good wife / which for the time is there
Thinks on other things and else where
She would she were / and god wot heuely
Is she content / but well and womanly
She keeps her kill / and does him as rioche good
As cast a stone against a pyece of wood
For help him self / can he not ne socoure
And she nothing is glad of his labor
How be it other did right well before
And she aside turns her chere therefore
A little / for that time / so stant the cas
For this is not / the good wine ypocras
which she before at other times had
This does her sore anoye / for it is bad
My love she says / ye make me all a fool
Better it were for you upon a stole
To sytte / and of such besynes you rest
This good man which all takes for the best
Keeps him as well / and derely as he may
That he of long time will by no way
Do her dyspleasure / trespace or offense
The pain he does endure with pacyence
He doubts lore the good wife to dysplease
And so he rests / some what for his ease
For he believes well / that of the game
Nothing she would / in any wise attame
So puts he him self in such dotage
That he supposes well it were damage
To her complexyon she is so low
And simple eke such words for to know
Because percase / that lately of her hew
She is dyscoloured in a manner new
wherefore the matter better he believes
And it may fortune after thus it preueth
That this good wife a goune or other thing
Of her husband would have to her liking
She knows well by his condycyon
when time is best to make a mocyon
Aduysynge in her mind him to begyle
To have all her desire / and on this wyle
Remembers she / that when they and no mo
In chamber be / and it does fortune so
That they in pleasures and delytes be
And in her mind / she does perceive and se
That he with some thing would have to do
Then will she put her good will there unto
And to make him such dalyaunce and chere
That it is meruaylous to tell or here
For why / a woman learned in that art
A thousand things new upon her part
Can do / to make good chere and dalyaunce
To whom she lust / such is the guyse of fcaunce
So in this deed the good man is well eased
For he is not accustomed to be pleased
with so good manner chere / and contenaunce
She clepeth him with all the cyrcumstaunce
And on the vysage / kysseth she him often
where as she lyketh / with her lyppes soft
Then this good man in this manner does say
I deem ye will ask some thing by my fay
Of me / and she says nay my trende as now
Nothing but make good chere I crave of you
For if it pleased god / I would deuyse
To have none other Joy ne paradyse
Than evermore between your arms twain
To be / whereby exyled were my pain
Truly my love / and also god me save
None other bliss would I desire to have
For my mouth touched not ne never shall
No man's mouth / but yours in special
Saving your cosyns and mine / well may ye wit.
And not but when ye list to command it
Sir I believe so gracyous and sweet
There is no man as ye / ne to me mete
My love says he / if it a squyre were
I would believe you for to be your fere
By / god she says / when ones I did you se
Far of / the same sight so rauyshed me
And yet I did you but behold a lyte
Than ye had all mine heart / love and delight
I would have had none other by my choys
Though it had been the dolphyn of vyennoys
I think almighty god / will it so be
That I shall live with you / and you with me
For why / my fader and my mother both
Dyspleased were with me / and wonder wroth
Because to have such one I nolde accord
But never would I by our blyssed lord
Though that one would have stayne me with a knyfe
yet thought I ever for to be your wife
And I ne know what thing that this may be
Saving I think it is our destyne
Than does this man his pleasure as him lyketh
And she is yelden therwithall and pyketh
A countenance and says / now wot ye what
I will demand / my love refuse not that
To promise me I you beseech and pray
The good man says / I will it not denay
if that it be such thing as I may do
Right well dysposed will I be thereto
My love she says / the wife of such a man
A furred goune with myneuers had on
This other day / and if that I durst crave
I would pray you / that such one I may have
Sir by my soul / for pride or for envy
I say it not / ne for to be Ioly
But for by cause sir / that I think ye be
As able as her husband to keep me
And of more sustaunce / if I should not lie
To maynteyne me / both well and honestlye
And she is not to make comparyson
That know ye well / as unto my person
Ne sir to have honor / pray or laud
I say it not for gyle / deceyte / ne fraud
But for this woman has so great a pride
I would be gladds that she laid it aside
And for none other thing so have I blys
Than this good man / which perauenture is
A great nygarde / thinks in his entente
That she of gounes has suffycyente
And so a while he rests in a thought
And says my love if that it be well sought
Have ye not gounes ynowe you to suffyse
Of diverse sorts furred in goodly wise
yes sir she says / for if I but a goune
Had and no mo / though it were a russet broune
I would not recke / and yet it were great shame
Than says this man / now care ye not good dame
Now let them speak / and talk enough with sorrow
For we of them / nothing do beg ne borowe
By god ye say the trout he / but will ye here
I am not like unto a chamberere
Of theyrs / and not so well cladde ne besene
As is my sister / ne as other been
And yet of years / more old I am than she
which is a foul / and an evil thing to se
Then peradventure / will this man consent
That shortly she shall have all her intent
And what she will desire in such a rage
which unto him / is nothing but damage
For when that her demand / and her request
She has / for to be fresshe than is she pressed
To go where feestes / and these daunces be
whereof no manner prouffyte geteth he
Peradventure she shall her dress and paynt
And have so little virtue and restraynt
That she in such unthrifty wife shall preue
And never man suppose would ne believe
And if this gown her please not / wy^^ ye know
She has an other love / ye may well trow
which peradtenture has no riches great
And is a galaunt fresshe / and can not get
More than to hold / and maytene his degree
And therefore soon / advise herself does she
Upon an other galaunt stout and gay
The which a dyamounde this other day
when that she was / at such a manner feste
Unto her would have given as a geste
And sent unto her / by her chamberere
well twenty scutes / in his best manner
Or thyrty / but so soon she ne them took
How be it / she gave a goodly look
All though she gretely / did refuse as than
whereby such comfort / took this gentylman
That he spoke to her chamberere again
whom he met going / to ward a fountain
Or else where / and to her thus he said
O Jane my very love / come hyder maid
I have to speak some things with you now
well sir says she / when that it pleases you
Good Jane he says / ye know right well the love
That I unto your maystresse have / above
All other creatures / now I you pray
Tell me if ye have herd her of me say
Any words / sir by my faith says she
Nothing certain / but good and honest
And she would you none evil / hurt ne harm
with that he takes her softely by the arm
Saying good Jane my love remember me
That I to her may recommaunded be
And in good faith here a goune I you give
with all my heart / and service while I live
Now certes says the chamberere again
That ready is to take the goune and feign
which he to her presents as I say
Sir I will not receive it by no way
By god says he fair Jane / but yet ye shall
It is god wot / a simple gift at all
And then he says unto the chamberere
I pray you that to morrow I may here
Some news of you / and thus god be your guide
Fare well sith ye / no longer may abide
Than to her maystres straight she gooth / and says
Folks have I found / in good point by my faith
what be they says her maystresse / tell me now
The same it is / the which right well ye know
And he as yet / is in good cas and plyte
For he is taken / with the fevers white
In such a wise / that what is best to do
He knows not / love does constrayne him so
The wife says than / a goodly man he is
And gracyous / ye say full sothe y wys
The chamberere than says for in my days
Such one I never knew at all assayes
He is most fair full rich / and well y shape
Most true of love withouten deceyte or Iape
And he can do enough / his love to please
A lady might / with him be well at ease
O Jane she says / by god I can not have
No such things of mine husband as I crave
And yet if he me hate / he plays the fool
For we shall bring him / in to an other scole
By god my Jane / I have so loved long
This gentylman / though I have kept my tongue
That to none other / could I give mine heart
So am I take / that I can not asterte
And this great folly is / by god above
For any woman thus to set her love
On any man / that in this world is here
And I shall tell you why / Jane will ye here
For when these men / on women lords be
All sodoynly in most necessyte
Causeles theo will forsake them and betraye
And thereof make / a tryfle or play
Then comes this galaunt or that other part
And to the chamberere he speaks a part
Saying in this manner / with hands up
Together Joined / close as any cup
My fair love Jane / ryghthumbly I you pray
Tharye will do / and help all that ye may
So that my work ye well achyeue and speed
And I shall never fail you at your need
So ye my maystresse / shall be euermo
Then answers she / and says if I might so
Sir for your love / I would speak what I might
But never meddled I by day ne night
Of things such / alas my love says he
What shall I do / for gods love counceyle me
By god she says / best is for you to speak
your self / and unto her your stomach break
All well to point / the matter comen is
For of her husband / has she late or this
A goune desired / only but of clothe
Which he denayed her / and she is wroth
I counceyle you / tomorowe that ye be
Tymely at church / where as ye may he^se
And when it happeth you / with her to mete
So as it lyketh you / ye may her great
There may ye show / your matter and intent
And such as ye will / give to her present
All be it so / that she it will not take
yet more she will you praise I undertake
your largess and your bounte shall the le
Alas my love / me lever were that she
Take it that I will give her / than refuse
Now sir says Jane / she will make her excuse
But I shall say you / what thing ye shall do
After that ye / have offered her unto
That thing the which / ye would her give indede
And she refuse it / than your cause to spedde
Deliver it to me / and at the lest
To cause hex take it / I shall do my best
For Ianone / can know her mind and feel
Now truly gentle Jane / ye say right well
Then gooth the chamberere / in Crystes name
And when she comes home / she says madame
A long time it is / if it you please
Or that some folk be brought to hertes ease
And who is that good Ia^e / tell me anon
y wys medame / ye know the same mon
What do away / I pray you tell me how
It is fair Jane / what tydynge with you now
Certes madame / he will not fail tomorowe
In church to speak with you / and all his sorrow
Unto you will he show / so as he can
ye may be sure / he is a gentylman
But well and wisely / govern you always
And make it strange / so as ye goodly may
Not over much of straungenes ne dysdayne
Use may ye not / but so between twain
Demean yon womanly / in hope that grace
Thereof shall grow within a little space
Upon the morrow this wife gooth to kyrke
As when a thing shall be / needs must it wyrke
So does this galaunt / which three hours and more
In good devotion god wot before
Passes the time / and draws to a place
Where he the holy water / in her face
May cast / and for to keep all thing from shame
He unto other women does the same
The which with her / be present than and there
And they thanken him in their best manner
But this poor man / would do them more service
If he so might / and does him well advise
That this good wife / still testeth in her sete
Living in hope / some grace of her to get
And says his bedes demeanynge him with all
As swetely as an image in a wall
And god wot / she is dressed proprely
After her power / which he well does espy
Beholdynge how she kneleth in her pewe
So well apparayled / with so fresshe a hew
And unto her / anon he draws nere
Where at their leyser / they do speak in fere
But nothing will she say / but herkeneth still
Unto the time / that he has spoken his will
Ne nothing of him / then will she receive
But so she answers him / that he perceive
May well / that she him loves peramoure
And that she dredeth not / but dyshonoure
Whereof he is well eased / and ago
From her / and from the chamberere also
And so he walks forth his stacyon
Then entren they in to collacyon!
That is to wete / the maystresse and her maid
Remembrynge well / such words as were said
And shortly / so conclude upon their deed
How that their work / they may perform and speed
And then the chamberere says secretly
Madame I know well / he has great envy
To speak to me but I will to him say
That ye nothing for him / by any way
Will do / and therefore wroth I will me make
For pure pity / the which I on him take
And I shall to him say / our sire is out
So he at night may come withouten doubt
Into your chamber secretly I trow
I shall him let / as though ye did not know
And I shall show as I were wroth / wherefore
He shall you pray / well better and the more
And sith he afterward / shall longer tarry
The same thing I will do bring and carry
Which he would give you / for I know that he
Tomorowe will deliver it to me
And I to him shall say / so god me save
That ye it neither / will receive ne have
And when it happeth shall / that after soon
The process and the acts be well done
Wherefore the goune / he gives you in reward
The which before he put in to my ward
Then ye therefore / shall chyde me fast and blame
Before him / saying / damoysell fie for shame
Wherefore did ye / this thing with you retain
Why would not ye deliver it again
But how someuer it come to pass / know ye
That I shall put all thing in certaynte
For some there be that have right many a wyle
Whereby innumerable they begyle
Of women good / and never can be still
Now Jane / from this day forward do your will
Forth gooth this galaunt than / and so does mete
The chamberere / somdele without the street
And asks her / what news the has brought
Of her maystresse / by god says she right naught
I have her found / so dangerous and strange
That sore I dread shame will make her to change
But for because I meddled have so far
Thinking no time is / longer to defer
This matter / I shall say you what is best
That ye may do / to bring your mind in rest
Thither shall ye go this night to work and speed
your matters / and yet have I so great dread
That she will to her husande me accuse
Or to her friends / but I think and muse
That if she will receive / such things as ye
To her would give / your deed soon spedde shall be
And yet by god / I shall prove and assay
To cause her take it shortly if I may
For well it is / at point to bring about
The matter / for her husband ryden out
Is now / and has denied her utterly
A goune / whereof she has so great envy
That it is marvel / and this galaunt tho
Twenty scutes / or thyrty / else mo
Delyuereth unto her / and Jane says than
By god ye be an honorable man
But well ye se / how I advise me
And yet I dread that troubled shall I be
For never did I thus / for man or now
As I for you have done / I make auowe
And will ye know / how great daungere that I
Have put me in / and I shall tell you why
For if so be / that known were one word
That any thing I should do by our lord
Herin / I should have ever such a blame
That never after / might I look for shame
But for because I trust you perfytely
I shall me put / in this great Ieoperdy
Knowing that she / you loves well at all
And that our sire is out / wherefore ye shall
This same night / come fair and honestly
Unto her chamber / and I secretly
Will let you in / for neither harre ne lock
Shall cause you either / for to call or knock
And thus at.xii. hours within the night
ye must walk in the derke withouten light
For that time sadly / does she sleep always
And there is but a little child in say
To her in bed than shall ye go and lie
For I can se / none other remedy
And peradventure your deed shall be good
Now when a man / all naked is by the rode
In bed with her / that naked is and bare
A full great thing it is and she unware
And when she sees none other choys ne read
As still she lies then / as she were deed
So sore she dredeth shame and vylany
That in the derke she may not se to cry
For though she answer straungely on the day
At such a sudden country she ne may
O Jane my love / this gentle galaunt says
I never shall have penny by my faith
But ye thereof that one half and well more
Shall have always / so well ye do therefore
When night shall come the galaunt gothe a pace
As Jane him has / aduysed to the pleace
And she unto her maystresse secretly
Has showed all the process manerly
And when this galaunt comen is and crepte
Into the bed / she lets as she slepte
This galaunt there / her shortly does embras
Then starteth she and says / who is there alas
My love says he / no more for it is I
A by the sacrament of god I cry
She says it shall not come to pass yet so
And thinks for to call / on Jane which tho
No word to her again answerde or said
Ha now I se it well / I am betrayed
Mine auctor says / the fight together both
In diverse wise / and she is passing wroth
And fast she pants / both for fere and ire
Wheihe is as angrye / as the brennynge fire
And sore abashed of this reckoning
ye may well know / it is a pyteous thing
A woman only when she lacks help
No more of strength is then a little whelpe
But if it had not ben for dread of shame
More high she would have cried in gods name
Then she did than but all was for the best
That she to save her honor so did rest
Was never fythyll / shalmeulx / pype ne rote
That better did accord in every note
Of musyk / or in gemetrye then they
Which enterprise / good time again to play
Thus for the husband that time being onte
Right well to point ye work they bring about
Now has this wife ye gown that was denayed
By her good man / and she is well apayed
And for because he nolde it to her give
It shall cost him full dear if she may live
All be it so that he in times before
Well more then it was wroth has paid therefore
And this good wife / all things to excuse
And because no wight her of should muse
Her mother will she cause with dylygence
This goune to give her in his presence
All boubtes to avoid that he may have
Thus honestly she can her worship save
And she her mother makes to believe
That this clothe she has bought as she can preue
Of those little things which she sold
Whereof her husband yet she never told
So he thereof does vnderstende no dele
Or parauenture he may know it well
And so it happeth often with her and mo
After this goune another comes also
That is to wit / a new thing must be had
For her that she / may honestly be clad
Also of gyrdels harneysed two or three
Of silver gylte / else angry will she be
Or other things / whereof her husband than
Will be as sore dyspleased as he can
The which is very melancolyous
Or like to Naball auarycyous
As I have said before / and he does doubt
Or narowly he pryeth and looks out
So that he well perceive has some thing
Wherein he took no pleasure nor liking
Or unto him it has be told or showed
Or her good love / this galaunt all be shrewed
By some fast friend of his this has he known
For at long rennynge out it shall be blown
Then entreteth he in rage of Ialousy
And puts him in to an agony
Anon he makes semblaunt to go out
And comes at night / staring all about
Full suddenly supposing in his mind
Out of array some folks to find
The which is not so easily to be done
Then hydeth he him in his chamber sone
And by adventure / some thing does espy
Wherefore he chydeth and she can well replye
She feleth that she wylye is and sage
And that she comen is of good lygnage
This sely man remembers him again
Of his friends how they have spoken plain
So they in riot and great debate
And sorrow and care / shall rest upon his pate
For Joys shall he never have in deed
Fro that time forth / but ever gnawe and feed
On heaviness / and ever among a lie
Shall cast be in the vysage prately
His cheuysaunce / shall lessen suddenly
Also his pore body shall be dry
So shall he cesse of works and business
And never live in well nor lustynesse
Thus closed in the lepe / abide shall he
These pains taking for prosperyte
For if that he this lepe were not within
yet never would he / tarry rest ne blynne
Unto the time that he thereto might crepe
And put him self in to the same more deep
Thus he ne would that otherwise he were
Right so this poor man / as ye may here
Shall ever languysshe in captyuyte
And deep within the lepe shall barred be
So wretchely his days shall he end
Fro such adventure god us all defend
Here ends the fyfth Joy of marriage.
Here begins the syxte Joy of marriage.


THe syxte Joy of marriage it is so
That he which was wedded long ago
Endured has the trauayles / and the pain
As I before have said / all or certain
Of them / and has a wife especyall
Diverse of her condycyons at all
A very subtle falfe and wyle shrewe
She is / as I here after shall you show
Cautelous wylfull / and eke malycyous
Fro ward / wanton / nyse and dysdaynous
And her husband a good man is and plain
The which her loves well / and she again
Loves him I trow / wherefore always he
So as he may by possybylyte
Does unto her / all pleasures that he can
For she of body is a good woman
How be it holly her entencyon
Is set so fast and her oppynyon
That ever by some craft or subtyllyte
Fail will she not to have the soueraynte
And or her husband works will she know
wheder he of his degree be high or low
So will she meddle often answer and speak
if myster be / and many matters break
Such is of her the dysposycyon
And after nature the condycyon
Of all wives / what husbands so they have
Or at leest / the maystrye will they crave
For tho this wife be well and want ryt naught
yet ever will she set her mind and thought
To bring her husband / into woe and care
And make him think and muse / evil fare
And otherwhyles it may fortune so
That he and she in chamber and no mo
Be all the night and some what of the day
In their delytes Joy dysporte and play
And they together kiss and make good che
But he aryseth first that their dynere
May ready be / and also he must think
Do other things mo then mete and drink
The house about and when time is to dyne
He calls her but she will not enclyne
Unto his speech but sends down anon
Her little child or of her servants one
which unto him then shall these words say
Sir in good faith she will not dyne to day
well says the good man / go again in have
And bid her come anon to this repast
Then gothe the servant or the child and says
My master byddeth you come now by my faith
To dinner sone for he will nothing eat
Till ye be come and set with him at mete
Go say to him I will not dyne says she
Upon which answer straight to her gothe he
And says to her what ayleth you my dear
She speaks not / wherefore he draws nere
And says what chere my love and is dysmayde
How be it he has seen such pagentes playde
Before that time / but for request ne word
That can be said she nyll go to the board
But play right so / and perchance in no wise
will dyne that day for thing he can deuyse
Another time / under her arm a side
He ledeth her as though she were a bryde
And they to dinner go / but cold is all
The vytaylles on the table great and small
For so long has she saused them to tarry*
Thus often times will she do contrayre
To reason / and such countenance and chere
with manners will she make at her dyner^
That no thing will she ete / ne bytte
For which so dull and mate he is of wit
And like a mased be for well the more
He loves her / and has her dear therefore
For such melancolyes she does him give
In thought and heaviness to cause him live
wherein right well she does and cunnyngly
Sith he will suffer it so curteysly
For why a woman for to get the grace
Of him whom she has bounden in her lace
Has not to do / sith that he loves her well
With heart / body / mind and every dele
And does her all the pleasures that he may
Her needs not / with such one for to play
But she must set her thought holy to get
The love of him / the which her does for yete
And by her sets / none account ne tale
She should assay to make such one auale
Unto her hand by chere and countenance
By pleasant speech / with all the cyrcumstaunce
A fair deed / she thinks to have wrought
When she her husband / in to care has brought
It happeth other while this man gooth out
Her works / and his besynes about
And when he home ward does return again
With him he brings of his friends twain
In to his house / by cause he has to do
With them / or else right well it may be so
That they of him have perfyte cognysaunce
Or else they be of his acquayntaunce
When he without is / as is said before
His yoman or his page / he sends before
Unto his wife / and prays her hertely
For to make ready / well and honestly
The houses all about / and other thing
For such friends as he would with him bring
Because to them / he gretely is behold
Also he prays her hastily that she would
Ordain vytayles to make them well at ease
For what he can / he will do them to please
And he with them percase has for to do
Now gooth this messenger his wife unto
And salueth her and says / madame truly
My master comes / and in his company
Two of his friends / men of good estate
For to be lodged here this night algate
Wherefore he prays you right specially
To se the souper dyght be / and ready
And she does answer saying / what have I
And do with / feestes / or of his company
Why comes he not himself to se it dyght
I wot not says the servant by this light
But thus to say / he has commanded me
Thon art accursed knave by god / says she
This fela we than holds his peace anon
And she in to a chamber is a gone
Such one she is / which does none otherwise
And wors is / she has a praty guyse
For all the servants here and there about
Both one and other / shortly she / sends out
And over this / if chamberere there be
Or of her daughters / one / or two / or three
The which at home abide / be taught how they
Unto the good man of the house shall say
When he comes home / and now he comen is
And calls upon a daughter first of his
Or else a chamberere / and says is all
Things ready made / the which we need shall
In faith she says / my maystresse is full seek
Your servants and your meyny be to seek
And certainly as yet / nothing is done
Wherewith the good man waxes angry soon
How be it / both his friends forth withal
He brings them curteysly in to the hall
Or in to other places else wh^re
As they be of estate / and fyndeth there
Nothings ready for to make them glad
It is no need to alke / if he be sad
For perauenture his friends which he brought
Perceive right well enpryntynge in their thought
That where he sent his servant or his page
Before unto his wife on his massage
They might well think that his commandment
Was not so sure as act of parlayment
This good man then does call his folks on hye
But none of them he find can nor espy
Except a pore knave or else a maid
That naught can do / and then he in a brayde
Gothe to his wives chamber suddenly
And her to speaks high and hastily
Wherefore have ye not done I you demand
As by my messagere I did comaunde
A sir she says so many things ye
Command / that by the holy trynyte
One shall not understand ne know well how
What for to do / o saint Mary now
Then says this man / clawynge fast his head
Now of this world / the most vngodely deed
And evil have ye done and vncurteysly
Se here the folks / that I most specially
Am bound unto / how may I do thereto
Says she / what would ye sir that I should do
Now with your cosyns much to do have we
It she weth well an unwise man be ye
Do as ye will after your guyse for I
Care not thereof a rysshe / nor yet a fly
Fair dame says he I you demand wherefore
Ye have sent out / your servants here tofore
Knew I quod she / that ye such business
Had daken on hand / how be it nevertheless
She sent them for the / in dyspyte wyttyngly
Of this good man / before all by and by
Then he the which will suffer and obey
Unto her fault / does no mo words say
But fro her gothe with care and heavy chere
For parauenture such his gestes were
That he had lever / an hondreth scutes and more
Have spente but she / nothing does care therefore
She has him seen and knows he will not byte
And that before he was not wont to smite
Shortly to speak he torneth him about
And of his folks gadreth in a route
Such as he fyndeth and does the best he can
To wells of work he demands than
Fair / fine / white and other naperye ware
Of dyapre and byddeth that they none spare
And table clothes or they to souper go
But of the good wife / he is answerde so
To waylles she says right good and fine there be
And for much better men / in their degree
Then be these folks / and of as good a place
They get none other as ever have I grace
These other clothes in vessels ben to stepe
As washing tubbes / laid in the water deep
How be it for the to waylles I say not this
For erly have I lost the kayes y wys
Of the doors / se how the chamberere
Does seek them besyly both here and there
And of the bed she torneth to and fro
The straw / also the good wife thus says tho
I wot not what I have done of late so bad
My wit and eke my heed is made so mad
With besynes / and mased is my brain
That where for to run / I ne wot certain
Truly says he / I am begyled well*
The coffres shall I break now every dele
A fair thing do ye than / the good wife says
And I shall tarry with you by my faith
I would ye had them all in pyeces broken
So that they never should be shytte ne loken
Such thing sometime a man may do in haste
That after ward he shall repent the waste
Than how to do / he knows not what is best
But for all this / he is in peace and rest
Supposing that she she weth him the truth
And forth with all / without any slouthe
Unto the table go they for to suppe
Of fresshe pypes / then to fill the cup
Great need it were for wine whereof they spend
Gooth low / and draws fast unto an end
And it as now / is neither good ne able
Well for to serve these gentylmen at table
And though that he bid one for to go
He geteth none / because she will not so
And as for these fruit or other thing
At his commandment / or else bidding
None can be had / for if he will them have
Unto his neighbor he must send his knave
Before the table his page and theyrs stand
And them among they compte and understand
Seeing the wives cursed look and chere
They say because our masters comen ben here
The wife is wroth but after souper then
Time does approach yt these good gentylmen
Shall go to bed / and this man does entrete
His wife for shetes white / but he can get
None good ne fine / because erly that day
Before the good wife lost has every kay
Hedshetes would he have / and pylowes white
And she them keeps from his ghestes quyte
In comen shetes so all that night they ly
But erly in the morning hastily
These friends arise / and hom ward them auaunce
Which have well known the wives countenance
Their pages by the way have comynynge
Whereof the man's page made reckoning
To them before and laughen by the way
Nothing content the which together say
They will not theder come again of long
Such comenynge these pages have among
Better had been this good man to have lost
Much of his good then to have been their host
And so to bring them theder to his shame
Whereof the wife all holly was to blame
The same moro we / I marvel much says he
Unto his wife / o benedycyte
Of your manners / for why I know not how
I shall demean or govern me with you
Ane maria / with me is much to do
She says. I nourysshe chekyns duckes pigs also
And evermore I labor and I spynne
And do all that I may some thing to win
yet can I not one hour have on the day
Ofrest ne ease / and ye travail always
About nothing / but ever wast and spend
And of our goods destroy and make an end
Upon such men with which I nothing have
To do / thus ye will neither get ne save
With them says he / yes these good men be they
That both us help / anoye or hyndre may
Then sadly he remembers in his mind
How that his wife so gentle is and kind
That when a galaunt comes he does think
Anon she will cause him to ete and drink
And upon him no good thing shall be spared
Wherefore to her has said and declared
That he will not this galaunt come more there
And there upon he byddeth her forbere
To draw him to her house / for he nothing
There has to do / and she says I shall bring
Him when me Just and cause him to comeynne
Where with great noise between them does begy^ne
The good man angrye then these words says
Wherein he shows well the fool he plays
Now by the sacrament of god if I
After this time can find or else espy
He with you speak / I shall make you more wroth
Then ever ye were / all be you leave or loathe
Now by my faith she says nothing I recke
All though he were hye hanged by the neck
But now I se right well / it is full sothe
A good woman the which no sins does
Shall have asmoche reprove / and more dyffaine
Then she ye which does wyckednes attain
She says if that I such a woman were
Which did her govern evil in manner
I had no need then for to be dysmayde
For much better she had done she said
Then I now do / and thus he and the wyue
Together make a noise / and so they strive
This in adventure / by the malice great
Of him or her / in such a fume and hete
They fall / that they will not together ly
Of long times in this melancoly
And that it is / that she desires sores
For this squire / of whom he spoke before
Shall perauenture come within the night
In at the back door out of his sight
Or else clyme in at a wyndowe hye
And to the wives bed go secretly
Not for to sin / ne do her hurt ne harm
But in her good man's stead to keep her warm
For other body she was good and true
As it is said before / or else of new
Mine auctor baryeth somewhat in his tale
And takes a knkko for the nyghtyngale
After all this the thing is well appeased
And for because the good wife shall be pleased
This good man does begin her for to flatre
And she can suffer him to speak and clatre
For ever would a woman flatred be
And lightly / troweth it in certaynte
if it in praysynge be of her godenesse
Of beauty bounte / or of / gentylnesse
Thus passes he the time till at the last
His wife he fyndeth sometime speaking fast
Unto this foresaid squyre in his place
Or in the church / or else where as she was
At such a feast and in to Ialousye
He enters in his mind / more feruentlye
Then ever a days before he did
By mean whereof so now it is betyde
Of worldly Joy he does himself defayte
And enters in to the thought and awayte
He lies and requereth subtylly
Her to espy or take with some folly
Wherein he plays the very fool always
Because the noble heart of man ne may
Ne ought of women's works to enquere
For yfhe should / the fault know and here
Ones of his wife / he might fall in such plyte
That medecyne never should him hele ne quyte
And then his shame / he sercheth in his mind
Enquerynge fast and he the same does find
Good reason is that he endure thereby
The shame which he before sought besyly
As in this case I count him cast away
And lost / for on his body and goods always
Great peril renneth and aege comes him upon
So is he folysshe like a beestly man
In every thing by reason of the play
And he within the lepe I dare well say
Yclosed is / in sorrow and heaviness
Which he does take / for Joy and gladness
Seeing that he / ne would but it were so
Thus shall he dwell in pains euermo
And so shall end his days wretchydly
Sith he will find / none other remedy
Here ends the.vi. Joy of marriage.
Here begins the.vii. Joy of marriage
THe.vii. Joy of marriage to know
Is as I find it written on the row
When that sometime / the man which married is
Has found a wife / as I have said or this
Which is a fellow good / at every season
And never will refuse nor forsake reason
When it is proffered her / but know ye may
Though she be good / as ye have herd me say
And of her body chaste or other wise
Yet ever has she such manner guyse
The which a rule is named general
In marriage and used over all
For every wife byleueth verayly
And holds this oppynyon sted fastly
That her husband the weykest creature
And most wretch is and leest work may endure.
As in regard / unto the secret craft
Of all other which in the world be lafte
And so it happeth often / and has bensene
That when a young lusty man and grene
Does marye him unto a good true maid
And they their pleasures take and be apayde
In such a wise that maruayle is to here
And take all that he may within a year
Of their dysporte / or else in two or three
Or mo in diverse wise so may it be
Whereby their youth is greatly waxen cold
But yet the good wife by an hundredth fold
Her wastes not so much / as does the man
In no manner for she so wisely can
Her body keep / fro business and pain
With labor will she not herself constrayne
Nor yet with pensyfnesse to say the sothe
With care ne sorrow / so as the good man does
And though they did but play / and make solace
Yet would she not waste in so short a space
As her good man does in this secret plays
Where with then he / she bettre may away
But truth it is / when women chyldrebere
And they be great / living in dread and fere
When they draw nere their time of chyldes birth
They suffrs peynes great withouten myrthe
Mine auctor says that it is to accounte
To man's pain / the which all does surmounte
He says the husband peynes be well more
The which must think / and care all things fore
About his household / as he has to do
He suffers anger trouble pain and woe
But of the sorrow / and the anguysshe great
Of chyldes birth / all does he clean forgete
How be it many words does he speak
Which in his breast he might well shyt and steke
For I will not those words put in ryme
But hold my tongue / and speak when it is time
He says these husbands belly be to get
But wives do no good / but drink and ete
And after this it falls saunce fail
That for such thoughts / labors and travail
The husband gretely wasted is and spent
Wherefore his mind he sets and intent
Some else where / applyenge not the game
More then of custom / for to please our dame
And also yfhe would the fayte assay
For lack of power / perchance he ne may
Perform his appetyte / desire and will
Wherefore as in that case / he holds him still
But this good wife / yet leueth not the craft
Her lust / ne courage be not her byrafte
As hot she is as ever she was before
And so it is that he may do no more
Then for be cause / her lyueree / and her fee
Of her delytes daily mynysshed be
Which she was wont to have of her good mon
In noise riot both they fall anon
Like as her leuere / mynyssheth lyte and lyte
They so begin to gren as they would byte
And though this lyuere / will her not suffyce
Yet evil does she not / for she is wise
But she ne leueth of deem / that he
In power is / much wors then other be
And she the more belueth it by reason
Because before she never in her season
Non other man / but him only assayed
Of whom she neither was content ne paid
And he to her was in suffycyente
Without her lyuere often she came and went
And yet by reason / and the ordinance
Of holy church / it is a suffysaunce
One man unto one woman to be knyt
But other while / the wife will Ieoparde it
For to assaye of other / two or three
If they so simple as her husband be
And then she which / ye craft so dare assaye
Parauenture believes it always
More certainly then she has done before
And such a fela we takes she therefore
That of the craft / ye which she does begin
But if it be for dread / she may not blynne
Or else / with plente / she be satysfyed
She will not be content / ne pacyfyed
For when this felawe comes happyly
He is enfamyned wherefore meruaylously
Does he / and she her husband thinks on
Reputing him / a very semple mon
And of right little power she byleueth
The better for so surely she it preueth
For such things as sometime comes by stelthe
Is better for a sykely wives health
Then such as she at home has but a lyte
Having thereto no lust nor appetyte
And thus she is in fast believe and sure
Experyence always does her assure
And sometime so fortuneth it that she
Another gossyp / which has married be
And knows reason / when it is to her showed
Good in her manners being and well thewed
The which byleueth eke that her husband
As does that other / for she can understand
And parauenture she has taken assaye
Of other mo as ye have herd me say
Whereof well gretter is the work and deed
Then of the good man having little mede
Which gives not him self to so great pain
For why he knows well / that for certain
Nyghe him always good plente shall he find
But knoweye well / that many meu by kind
Use contrary to this that women do
For surely they byleuen euermo
What manner women so they have and wedde
They be most wise / and best for them in bed
Of all other / but this rule other while
Do fail / and that is by deceyte and gyie
Among rybauldes living in despeyre
To whom no wit ne reason does repair
Often it is seen / that married men will praise
The manners of their wives and vpreyse
And every verture which they in them find
They show supposing / surely in their mind
That better women / be there none then they
Ne like to them none can be found they say
In goodness far all other they excede
Such appetyte to them have they at need
Thus does mine auctor speak of wedded men
And forth withal thus he declereth then
Saying / that gladly often it has been seen
That when a woman / has a wydowe been
Then shortly to another will she marye
And other whiles she nyll abide ne tarry
A month but she will her wedde again
For to assaye and prove in certain
if that another of his power be
So simple in his works as was he
The which out of this world of late is past
And thus in wedlock she is bounden fast
Wherein she keeps neither truth ne faith
But wastes folyly mine auctor says
Loses and gives much goods a way
For which her husband many a weary day
Has had in loboure / or yt they have been gotten
After his degree / but all has she forgoten
By many manner ways does she spend
As well upon her lemman / or her friend
As old baudes / and on her confessor
A friar prechour / or else a lymatour
Which yearly has of her alpensyon
For she of him has absolucyon
Such folks have great power of the pope
For to absoyle / enserche / and for to grope
The conscience of wydowes and of wives
And them to teache how they shall led their lives
This man her husband on yt other side
As warely / as he can does him gyde
Withouten great expense or else cost
And casts account / what he has won or lost
Of marchaundyses / after such degree
As he is of / and shortly fyndeth he
That in his gods he gothe fast abakke
And knows well enough there is great lakke
Then he ta syghe / and sorrow does begin
And when that he / his compter is withynne
Unto his wife / the which he loves more
Then that he does him self he speaks therefore
And thus he says mine own love verayment
I know not how our goods be waste or spent
Or where they be become I can not tell
Gold or silver wherewith / we bye and selle
Wine corn / and other marchaundyse
And yet always I take heed and advise
The beast wise that I can look or espy
And have to every thing / as good an eye
As is possible unto me to have
Our goods for to govern rule and save
So that one gown / that good is for my corce
I dare not have / A sir she says no force
And when that he is / in a secret place
Unto his wife he speaks / this percase
Truly / but late it has be showed to me
Some words which dyspleasaunt to me be
By god my love right so it does appear
For of long time ye have made evil chere
She says / I have been sore affrayed and dradde
That ye some hurt or heaviness have had
Or that some of your friends had been past
To god / or had been kept in prison fast
With english men / ytake at some affray
Nay nothing so / but much wors than ye do say
It is / Aue maria says she than
If it please you / tell me good gentylman
What thing it is / feign would I that I knew
Certes says he / my faithful friend and true
Has showed me / that such one maynteneth you
And other things he has said ynow
Then she begins for to cross and blis
And many meruayles makes she of this
Demurely she begins for to smyle
My love she says / meke no wors chere a while
Of all my sins / as quyte I would I were
And eke toward almighty god as clear
As I of him am / and she there withal
Her hands lyfteth / and lets them fall
Upon her heed / and says mine own heart dear
By this all only will I not now swear
But to the devil give I all at ones
Under my hands / all be it flesh and bones
If ever man's mouth yet touched mine
Except your mouth / your kynnesmen and cosyne
And never but at your commandment
The which ye know was but in good intent
Fie / fie says the / what manner is it
I am right glad that ye dome to wit
I doubted it had been some other thing
But now I know from whens comes this lesynge
And all these words unto you showed ofnewe
But for what cause would god that ye knew
He has it said to you for by my faith
Right sore abassed would ye be she says
For so much as he makes him your good friend
But I right well am eased in my mind
For he awaked has / the slepynge catte
My love says he now tell me what is that
Sir care ye not thereof she says but lyte
An other time I shall do you to wit
Truly says he I will know it anon
By god my love ye be an hastly mon
She says I was right wroth be cause that ye
Made him to come so often for to be
Within your house / but I forbere to say
Be cause that ye loved him so well always
Tell me says he / certes my love as now
She says no need it is to tell it you
I pray you she it me so as it is
He says. And the then swetely does him kiss
And clyp saying my dear love and mine lord
Ha that fall traitor which make would dyscorde
Byt wexte vst weyne / and do you evil or gryfe
God give him very vengeance and myschyefe
Tell me my love says he / what manner wight
He is that thus would do / and what he hight
Now in good faith my lord whom I love best
Above all things that in this world do rest
That false traitor and that sclaunderour
Has prayed me to be his paramoure
The which ye trust and louen so entyer
This has he ben about more then two year
But I always have him full well refused
With great pain / and manners that I used
And when he came in to your house ye thought
It for your your love had been / but it was naught
For with his false flattering words gay
He came for no cause / but you to betray
Ne never ceased he till time that I
Say hd tat I would tell you it certainly
Nothing her of to me was charge ne cure
For of my self always was I so sure
And though I such unthrifty manners hate
yet would I not make noise wrath ne debate
Bet wene you thus and him / me thought no need
It was / because I kept him from the deed
Alas there was no fault in him truly
For to have done you shame and velony
A saint Mary says the good man tho
He is a traytoure that I trusted so
For never had I of him any doubt
By god she says / if he come in and out
And that I know that he does with you speak
Or dele then up / our household may we break
For after that I shall none with you hold
If ye so do / for silver ne for gold
She says / in faith ye need not me to guard
I am suffycyent my self to ward
If it please god / I will not now begin
Against his laws to do / or use a sin
With hands Joined / to god almyght I pray
That fire from heaven above descend may
And brenne my body all to naught and spyl
Well rather than I should be in such will
Then the clepeth him in her arms twaye
And says my lord / harken what I say
Over false I were / if I should evil do
To you that be so fair and good thereto
For what I will / my love ye will the same
But if I loved you well I were to blame
I will that ye so god me save and mende
Your house from him forbede would and defend
With whom your friend / me falsely has accused
And you deceived thus / and sore abused
Now be it freely do I give or sell
My soul unto the foulest fend of hell
If ever he to me spoke less or more
But not withstanding yet by christ therefore
I will not that he come in place where I
Shall happen for to be in company
Than she to weep began right tenderly
And this good man appeased her spedely
Promising her with oaths great that he
Would keep and hold all things which that she
Before had said / except he nolde defend
This felawe from his house / and there an end
All be it in his heart with some remors
He shall be charged sore / but yet no force
For so it happeth in conclusyon
That such dyspleasure and deuysyon
Bet wene him and his friend hereof does fall
That he the gretest ennemy of all
To him shall be / the which for love him told
Has all the truth / whom he beleuene would
So this good man a very be is made
Such Joys of the husholde he has had
And in the lepe he is yclosed deep
Out of the which he shall not lightly crepe
And this good wife much better in her guyse
Shall do / then ever she did or could deuyse
And never man of her shall tell him thing
For he will not believe such reckoning
And he the which this velony has done
The best beloved friend shall be then sone
That he shall have / and thus aege him upon
Shortly does fall / and pouerte anon
Where with perchance so sore he may be grieved
That never after shall he be releued
Such is the pleasure / which this man has found
Within the lepe / and yet folks on the ground
Will speak to him after their fantasy
One says of him / thus as he passes by
He is good Johan / an other makes a she we
With his finger / an other unthrifty shrewe
Says that it is great damage for to se
This sely man in such perplexyte
Another says / no force of him in fay
It is nothing but good right of the play
So lives he / with pain in pacyence
And all these sore was does him none offense
The which for Joys always takes he
Because he will that it none other be
So shall he evermore dwell in dystres
And end his days in pain and wretchedness
Here ends the seventh Joy of marriage.
Here begins the eight Joy of marriage.


UNto the.viii. Joy sith I must go
Of marriage / know ye that it is so
As when a man such mean has found and skyft
Thus he un ware in to the lepe is left
Wherein he has had great felycyte
Taking his pleasures / years two or three
And has so besy ben to repe and sow
That well the hot heruest is over blow
Then other men's work will he assay
No man at base ne bars may sport always
And peradventure he has had greuaunce
enough of trouble / and of dyspleasaunce
Whereof enfebled gretely than is he
So that regard takes he none to fle
Perchance his wife / has children three or mo
And great with child again she gooth also
But she more seek is or this child be borne
Than she of all these other was beforne
Wherefore the good man is in thought and dread
To get her such thing as she must have need
But this good man / does his auowes make
To diverse holy saints for her sake
And also she auoweth in that hour
Unto our blessed lady of Rochemadoure
So happeth it / as god will after this
And saint Mary that she delivered is
Of such a fair child and goodly thing
As might be well the sone unto a king
She lies long in bed / now in this wise
The gossyppes to her come / as is the guyse
And makes arete / andtt merry syynge up
Where besely gooth round about the cup
And so it falls she has two or three
Gossyppes / the which abide with her / and be
Within the house to rule merely
With her / and gossyp in her company
And so shall peradventure be that they
May talk of tryftles / which I will not say
And more goods spend they in such wise
Then for to find the household would suffyse
The new time approaches her / and she
Is puryfyed with solempnyte
Unto the feldes then / to roue and play
She and her gossyppes take the ride way
Where as they speak to go on pilgrimage
And fast they entrepryse for their vyage
For what thing so the husband has to do
They care nothing / ne have regard thereto
Then this good wife of whom we speak of now
Says to her gossyppes I wot never how
I may have license to perform this deed
And they her answer saying have no dread
Good gentle gossyp / for we have no doubt
But ye shall bring your purpose well about
And we shall go and us dysporte together
When god well send time and merye weder
Now have they entreprysed as I say
This forlayd vyage and depart away
One from an other a mile two or more
And then this wife of whom we spoke before
Comes to her house. And when she draws nere
Unto her housbande she makes evil chere
And he is lately comen from the town
Or else from other works and sets down
And her demands how it with her is
Ha sir says she I am right wroth y wys
Our little child is evil at ease and seek
Whereof the good man is as angrye eke
And sorrowful and comes it to see
When he it sees / the teres fall in his eye
For pure pytye / and then comes night upon
And when they be in secret place allone
The wife begins for to sygh and say
Truly my love ye me forgete always
And how says he think ye not on says she
When that I was in great infyrmyte
Of our young child / and that I made auowe
Unto our lady of rochemadoure / and now
Thereof it seems ye take little head
O god he says / my love ye know what need
There is / and how much that I have to do
Good sir she says. I put case it be so
yet never shall I be at ease ne glad
By god till I this pilgrimage have made
And by my faith because we do not seek
These saints therefore is our child so seek
My love says he god knows well your good will
And mine also. Ha sir she says be still
For certainly if it please god and you
I will according unto mine auowe
Go with my cosyns and my gossyppes als
Unto our lady I will not be falls
Then this good man the matter myndeth sore
And peradventure has not all in store
That to this vyage should be requysyte
According to his wyfes appetyte
Now is he brought to such encombraunce
That nedely must he must he make a cheuysaunce
Of horses / and perchance for them shall pay
A certain hyre to travail by the way
After such port / estate or else degree
As he is / and it behooves that she
A new gown have to ride in honestly
And peradventure in that company
A gentle galaunt is / the which shall do
With right good will some service her unto
Also this good man percase with her gothe
On pilgrimage all be he never so wroth
if he so do / much better were that tide
For him at home to tarry or abide
Always so sore she will him chyde or chekke
That he shall bear the stones upon his nekke
And never can she be content ne feign
But when that he has hurt myschefe or pain
Now in that Journey / as she sytteth soft
Upon the horse / she her complayneth often
Anon she says / one styrope is to long
Another is to short and lacks a thonge
Also she says / her horse does trotte to sore
And eke to hard / and she is seek therefore
Then from her horse she must alyght anon
And she again shall set be him upon
This good man then / for he shall not be idle
Over such a bridge / must led her by the bridle
Or else a peryllous path / or a narowe way
And when they come be from this Journey
If he thereby have had well or dysporte
That it of her long / she will report
And if that any loss / or evil fall
She chydeth and says / on him it is long all
So thus and other wise his goods wafte
His household eke / and his expense in haste
Then mynysshed be / and she says him beforne
How by his children which that she has borne
She greatly wasted is / and this man so
yclosed is within the lepe also
In sorrows great / and pains sharp and sore
And takes them for Joys evermore
In which always he shall be and remain
And wretchedly his days end in pain
Here ends the eight Joy of marriage.
Here begins the nynth Joy of marriage.


THe nynthe Joy of marriage is when
One of these young lusty and fresshe men
Is put in to the prison or the lepe
Of husbandry and can not go ne lepe
Out of the same / and great pleasure has had
which newely has be found in days glad
And peradventure evil is his wife
As many be / whereby aryseth strife
And he a man is of good governance
The which none evil iuffre will perchance
How be it diverse arguments have been
And other whiles strokes them between
So in such war / well thyrty or more
They have continued / and ye may know therefore
He has had much to suffer and sustain
For so may be that he has had certain
Great part of sorrows / and aduersytees
The which before be said / in their degrees
And many other such as ben contained
Here after in this little book unfeigned
But nevertheless / he does remain always
Uyctoryous / what ever she do or say
And has not ben in shame and velony
Though much to suffer he has had thereby
And for to think upon because that he
perchauce has daughters fair / well two or three
which wisely he has married here and there
To put them out of Ieoperdy and fere
So happeth it that in a little space
Such fortune has this sely man and grace
That for the evil nyghtes and the days
And cold which he has taken many ways
A cheuysaunce to make / this man does fall
In sekenes of the gout / then forth withal
Or else for aege / he is un weldy so
That he can neither up arise ne go
And when that he is set in such a place
As he shall in remain his lyfes space
In evil manner turned is the chance
For than the war is ended and dystaunce
And wors it is for diverse times a day
Of very hate she will unto him say
She is right well assured in certain
How for his sins / he has all that pain
And one may think / when she before him is
Thus will he to her say / my love y wys
ye be the thing that I owebest to love
Of all the world / except our lord above
And ye also of duty ben ybounde
To love me most of all that live on ground
But wit ye well / my love that it is so
Some things be / that folks unto me dos
wherewith I am not well content says he
ye know of right I am and so shall be
The lord and master of this house whiles I
May live / but yet folks do not like truly
To me / for if that I a poor man were
which should go fetch his bread both far and nere
Men would not do to me as is done now
And ye my love may understood how
That I have done great pain and dylygence
To make a cheuysaunce for our expense
your doings to sustain / and your estate
And all our children which to me of late
Behave them self full symply as ye se
Ha what would ye that one should do says she
To you is done the best we can or may
And ye wot not what we demand or say
Now says this man / hold your peace good dame
And keep your tongue in rest for worldly shame
The sone also to him does speak and rail
So what this good man says may not avail
And thus she and the sone depart him fro
His heritage emperynge euernio
And for the good man / no prouysyon
Is made / and thus they in conclusyon
Agree and make accord between them both
That never creature / which comes or gothe
Shall with him speak / and then the sone anon
The governance presume will him upon
And take the rule more than he did before
And well content his mother is therefore
For she so does supporte him and maytene
Also they make well every man to wene
That he is fall in to a frenesy
Or is returned to his Infancy
Thus unto every wight says she and he
And this good man must take it all in gre
For other remedy none may be had
Among them so hard he is bestadde
And as to me I well believe certain
This is one of the greatest erthely pain
And sorrow / that on the ground a man may feel
Thus this good man his penance does right well
And so shall be in morning evermore
Endrnge his days wretchedly and sore
Cursynge the time that in the lepe he came
To be enclosed / and in this wise made tame*
Here ends the nynth Joy of marriage.
Here begnneth the tenth Joy of marriage.


THe tenthe Joy of marriage to wit
Is as I find it in a book y write
When that he which in to the lepe is brought
Because that he has seen so as he thought
Other fysshes them baynynge in the same
Which to his demynge / had a merry game
And so he trauayled has till time he
In to the lepe has found the right enter
And one may say that he by subtylte
Made was to come / in to that gynne and be
Of marriage / like as a fouler old
These birds takes in the winter cold
With other birds which he before has had
And for that feate has them well taught and made*
And bears them about upon his back
Within his panyer or else a sack
Which with a threde be teyed by the foot
For to remain there is none other bote
Much eased were these poor birds if they
Might be at lyberte and fle away
As other do from a river or a dyke
Unto an other where they might feed / and pyke
Of every manner vytayle / for them mete
When other se these birds by the fete
Yteyed fast / they haste unto the gynne
And suddenly they be taken therein
But if it be some wyle birds that have
Experyence them to preserve and save
From such daungere / and wisely can be ware
Surely to keep them from the net or snare
For they in time before have herd and seen
Of other birds which in that case have been
This not withstanding they that wydded are
Of which we show the pass time and declare
Have them aduysed of this craft / and they
But little evil thought in it always
Or else percase without advise in haste
In to the gynne one has his body cast
Where as in Joys demed he to tarry
Nevertheless / he fyndeth the contrary
And other whiles it may fortune so
That for such things as showed are them to
By totelers or flatterers that use
To cause descorde / and falsely folk accnse
The wife shall never more for erthely thing
Her husband love / unto her last ending
Then will she say unto her mother thus
Or to our cosyn / by our lord Ihesus
When I with him in bed am laid adoune
His flesh it stynketh like a caryoune
And he to her shall never plaesure do
Ne love / but ever live in malice so
And often it happeth / many men that he
In such estate / of high and low degree
And women both yet will they not live chaste
But ease them self by other means in haste
And when that she a while has been away
With her good love / for to dysporte and play
And largely has her part had of the game
Then her to keep from velony and shame
Some of her friends good / will she entrete
Peace with her mother shortly sor to get
The which by color / and craftily can say
That she within her house has been always
The poor daughter pryuely is gone
For she so sore her dredde / that her good mon
Would her have bet / as he has done or than
Wherefore unto her moders house she ran
And he has wonder where that she may be
But so it was that afterward he
Within her moders house / soon does her find
To whom he speaks with an hasty mind
What devil brought the hyder / and for why
Departed thou from home so suddenly
Sir by our lord she says / for dread that ye
Withouten cause / sore would have stryken me
Then says the mother / certes me were lever
That ye sone / and my daughter should dysse^
And that ye leave her here with me to keep
Then for to beat her always till she weep
For I know well / my daughter has not done
Defaute to you / but ye be angry sone
Behold this matter / look thereon and se
If she of evil governance had be
She had be lost / but ye may se here
From shame and mysrule for to keep her clear
Straight unto me she came / for she ne had
None other help / whereof ye may be glad
And she by right / her may repent and rewe
That she to you / has been so kind and trwe
And it may fortune other whiles that they
Demand to be departed bysome wey
Wherefore the husband does accuse the wife
And she again / as sharp as sword or knyfe
Unto the husband quyckely does the same
ye may be sure / her tongue shall not be lame
So are they in the lepe / and would be out
But so it may not be withouten doubt
It is no time them to repent / for why
Then is none other way ne remedy
Before the law / fast do they plede their cause
And by their advocates she we many a clause
But other while allegge they no cause why
They should have their entente so hastily
Than says ye Judge right plainly in Judgment
Unto them thus by good aduysement
The law it will that ye together hold
In company your lives and household
And here unto the Judge them does advise
But so to do / yet be they not so wise
For why / such goods as they had before
They have mysse used evil spente and lore
And yet they be not werye but endure
In their oppynyons stydfaste and sure
So mokke and skorne them folks far and nere
Which of the matter / understand or here
And other whiles / causes reasonnable
One does allege / and things acceptable
For which the Judge departs them a sondre
All be it so that folks upon it wondre
Then one of them or other folysshely
Will use them self in living vycyousely
Some time the woman gothe fro twone to town
And in to the mennys chambres up and down
Where she her pleasures takes of the game
And parauenture he will do the same
Supposing they ben at their lyberte
Out of the lepe of marriage and free
But yet be they in wors cas then before
And thus this man him wastes more and more
Of what astate so ever that he be
And in the same manner / wastes she
For never after may they wedde again
During their lives by the laws plain
Of france but yet in england other wise
They use and have a custom and a gyse
Which is an other for to take and wedde
Man or woman / where best they can be spedde
Men think in france / such shamed be for ever
As in that wise continue and perserue
And namely if they be of high parentage
Borne or descended / for a good lynage
For parauenture a galaunt openly
Within his house shall keep her shame fully
So shall he be within the lepe adowne
In sorrow care and lementacyon
Where he always in pains and dystresse
Shall live and end his days in wretchedness
Here ends the.x. Joy of marriage
Here begins the.xi. Joy of marriage


THe.xi. Joy of marriage to say
Is when a young lusty man and gaye
A gentle ioly galaunt wyllgo out
For his dysporte / the countrees him about
Into right many places all the year
And in especyall he will go where
These ladies and the gentylwomen be
After thestate condycyon or degree
That he is of / and for that he is young
And amerous / he preceth them among
No charge has he of any other thing
So that he may continue his living
In pleasures which by nyghtes and by days
Right many profres makes and assayes
And if it fortune so that he may find
A lady or a gentylwoman kind
With whom he has some thing to do or say
His mind and will applies he always
And does his best / her for to please and serve
To that entente he may her grace deserve
And sometime comes he in such place
Where as a maid he fyndeth fair of face
And parauenture not so great is he
Of lygnage / ne of noble as is she
And for that she so goodly is and fair
These supplyauntes sometime to her repair
And them among one is that does entrete
Her for to have / and profereth gifts great
Whom she but lyte refuses or denies
For every gentylwoman her applies
The which debonayre is and has pity
Compassyon to have in that degree
On such as them / humbly beseech and pray
In goodly wise / they ought not to denaye
if their petycyon be resonnable
Withouten vylonye / an(...)ourable
Torn we again to this fair damoysell
That of her manners somewhat I may tell
Of her conceytes and dysposycyon
which by constraynt or else oppressyone
Of such a poor fellow is forlayne
And never shall she* find ne get again
That she has lost / for where she was a maid
So has this homely fellow her betrayde
That she is great with child / ye which her dame
Perceyueth well / for she knows of the game
And in that craft she wylye is and felfe
For so it fortune may / that she has alse
Sometime ben / in like condycyon
The better can she find prouysyon
And never shall this fellow touch her more
Nor come to her as he was wont before
The wife this matter will / so rule and gyde
This counseyll keeping closse on every side
All things must be taken as they be
Of reason / wisdom / and necessyte
This poor damoseyll with child / is great
which of conceyuynge / has the time foryete
For of herself knows she but lyte
How she was brought in to such ease and plyte
And she nothings knows of that art
Ne what it is she took so little part
But if it please our lord god she shall know
How seeds grows after they be sow
The mother auyseth well and sees her hew
which knows the old testament and new
And calls her into a secret place
She says come hyder with an evil grace
Have I not said to the before this hour
That thou have lost thy worship and honor
To do as thou have done thus folyly
But when a thing is done what remedy
That thou art great with child I know it well /
Tell me the truth and dread the never a dele
Now fair mother I wot not as ye say
To tell you truth wheder it be so or nay
Then says the mother / it seems me always
when that the morrow comes every day
I here the coughe / and pytously forbrake
And diverse other countenaunces make
Now truly so it is she says madame
Ha says her mother hold thy pease for shame
Thou art with child / tell it not all about
Ne to none erthely person break it out
And always take a good respect and head
To do as I the shall command and bid
Madame so shall I do in every thing
And lowely you obey / and your bidding
The mother then says to her daughter tho
Have thou not seen so often come and go
Into our house such a young squire often
And she says yes madame with words soft
Now then advise the well for incertayne
Tomorowe heder will he come again
Then take good head that thou make him good chere
In godly wise and in thy best manner
And when that other gentylmen and me
Thou see together talk / then cast an eye
On him always / and this good mother so
Her daughter techeth well how she shall do
Also I the command and charge if he
Of any manner things speak to the
Harken him well / and answer curteylly
And swetely rule thy speech and manerly
And if he speak of love / or things like
Then other whiles softely give a syke
And thank him hertyly / but say y wys
Thou know not yet / what manner thing love is
Ne it to learn / thou will not the apply
Rule and demean the well and womanly
And gold or silver if he proffre the
Then take it not in have / but harken me
if he the proffre Iuell cross or ring
Gyrdell bracelet owcheor other thing
Refuse it gracyouesely / but at the last
if he it often offer the and fast
Receive it then / in goodly wise and take
For love of him / saying that for his sake
Thou will it keep / thykynge no vyllonye
Shame ne deceyte / that shall ensuye thereby
And when he takes leave of the to go
Then him demand or he depart the fro
if one shall see him hastyly again
whereof say that / thou would be glad and feign
Here is this galaunt come which shall be cast
ynto the lepe / and therein holden fast
For why the dame will cause him for to wedde
Her daughter sone / and with her do to bed
if that she can by any carfte or wyle
This galaunt she porposeth to be gyle
For he much has / of heritage and rent
And is / but simple and an Innocent
Now comes he this damoysell to see
In have for over well at ease is he
Right many galau^tes bent have their engyne
To take this damoysell / and undermine
The lady takes a squire by the hand
Or else a knight and other sytte or stand
which Ioyeously together talk and rail
This galaunt eke draws to the damoysayle
And by the hand he does her take and hold
Saying fair damoysell good god it would
That ye my thought well knew and understood
And how may I she says for any good
Know it / but if ye will it to me say
what do ye think such things as ye ne may
Tell me / nay by my faith I would that ye
Knew it so that It were not said by me
Truly she says and laugheth pratyly
ye tell a thing to me / so meruaylousely
which to be done it is as / in possible
As for to cause an horse walk in vysyble
if it had lyked you this glaunt says
And no dyspleasyr taken in good faith
I would have plainly showed you my thought
Now sir says she tell on and spare it naught
So much of you know I that by the rode
ye will not say / ne show thing / but all good
Maystresse he says / ye know right well that I
Am but a poor gentylman for why
I wot I am un worthy / and unable
To be your love / or with you compaygnable
For ye be gentle fair and gracious
And of all virtues full and beauteuouse
And if it pleased you to do to me
Such honor that your lover I might be
I durst maste mine avaunt that with good will
I should do all the pleasyrs you until
That any man / by possybylyte
May to his lady do in soueraynte
I shall you serve / and eke your honor keep
More then mine own whether ye wake or sleep
Grant mercy sir then says this damoysell
But for the love of god speak never adell
Of such things unto me after this
For I know not what manner thing love is
Ne yet I will not learn it ferthermore
For it is not doctrine ne the lore
The which my mother has me taught always
Then says this squire damoysell in fay
My fair lady of whom ye speak is good
But I would not yet that she understood
Such things as be said be twexte us twaye
A sir she says if you I have herd say
This other day / that ye should married be
Whereof I maruayle and ye come to me
And speak such ydell words / and then he
Says damoysell Obenedycyte
Now by my faith if that it please you
I shall never other wedde I make auowe
While that I live / so that ye will me take
As for your servant and I undertake
That with my service ye shall be content
What would ye have me deshonoured and shente
She says / nay yet me lever were to dye
Says he / then for to do you vyllonye
For goods love be still and speak no more
Hereof and I shall tell you sir wherefore
if that / my / mother it perceive or wit
I shall destroyed be I know well it
And parauenture the mother makes a sign
That of her speaking she shall cesse and fine
And then this galaunt gives her a ring
Under her hand or else some other thing
Saying to her / fair lady I you pray
Take this and keep it / for my love always
Certes says she I will not take no
Alas my love he says / why say ye so
I pray you hertely / and in her hand
He puts it again so as they stand
And she it takes and says / this I receive
To have your love as you may well perceive
Without thought of thing / but all honor
I take wytenesse unto my sauyoure
The lady of that house thus speaks then
In curteyse wise unto the gentle men
To moro we must I go with gods grace
Unto a blyssed lady of such a place
On pilgrimage to such a town here by
Truly madame they say / right virtuously
And well ye speak / and forth withal they go
To souper / and this galaunt euermo
Anenst this damoysell is put or set
That he to her may talk withouten let
And she so well can make her personage
In such a wise / that he half in a rage
With love is take of her that was so bright
And beauteuous as seemed to his sight
The moro we comes this company must ride
On pilgrimage / and longer not abide
And all men say they can not se ne find
An horse among them all yt bears behind
Except this galau^tes horse there by saint loy
Whereof great pleasure takes he and Joy
For one the damoysell behind his back
Does set upon his horse / and he no lack
Fyndeth therein / and she clyppeth him fast
To hold her on the horse / that he ne cast
Her down / and god wot there with he is eased
As an hawk which has an heron seized
Now draws he nyghe the lepe withouten bote
They do this foresaid vyage god it wot
With perfyte mind / and good entencyon
And home return / as made is mencyon
Where merely / they set them down to mete
With such vytayles as they can find and get
And after mete the lady fair and well
Gooth to her chamber / and this damoysell
To whom she says / when thou spekest with this man
Say unto him as sadly as thou can
That there is one / which spoken has to the
Of marriage but thou ne will accorded be
As yet / and if he offer the to take
Thank him / and say that he must means make
To me / and put the matter to my will
And that I do therein thou shalt fulfill
On my behalf / and say that there is none
Living in this world I except not one
That thou love half so well in certaynte
As him / so as may stand with honest
And all they after walks twain and twain
Together arm in arm to the gardeyne
Where as among the herbs / and the flowers
They smell and taste the holsom sweet odoures
And playenge take the flowers by the stalk
Which to their nose they put so as they walk
One takes a gelofer or vyolere
An other plucketh of the englentere
And every one of them as they espy
Take herb or flower after their fantasye
This galaunt squyre with the daughter gothe
And tells her every thing / but she is wroth
Alas she says / speak no more so for I
Shall if ye do / forsake your company
What would ye do me seems ye suppose
To cause me / mine honor for to lose
Have ye not herd of late days ysayde
That one to mary me has spoke and prayde
Now by my soul he says I can not blame
Him / though to mary you / he would attame
But I think that of mine habylyte
I am as good in value as is he
And eke as able / service you to do
As is the man of whom that ye speak so
Now by my faith she says than with a syke
I would that he were to your person like
Grant mercy fair damoysell he says
For of your great curteysy in faith
Well more than I am worthy / ye me praise
But ye mine honor gretely may up raise
if ye would take me as your man to grace
To do you service all my lives space
And she says sir grant mercy there withal
This must be spoken in especyall
Unto my fader sadly and my mother
And to my kynne / and friends diverse oder
Than says he thus / if I might know yt they
Should be content / I would both speak and prey
A sir she says / be ware that ye ne say
That ye to me have spoken by any way
For rather would I suffer death / than ye
Should any words she we of preuyte
That has be said in any manner wise
Byt wene vst wayne / nay that is not my guyse
Says he / which to the mother speaks soon
And as god would in such point was the moon
when he unto the mother made request
That he all his desire had at the leest
For she and other have them trouthes plyght
And peradventure caused them at night
To gyder / for to lie in bed and sleep
Now is this poor squyre plonged deep
within the lepe / and spedely they make
The wedding / for this gentyl woman's sake
And hastily they do this matter speed
Because her friends have great doubt and dread
Lest any let may come in this matere
For in the wind the weder was clear
The night is come after they be wedde
This damoysell with man must go to bed
And knoweye well / the old wyle dame
will teache her daughter / some what of the game
How she right may denly shall her demean
As though she were an holy vyrgyn clean
Mine auctour says her mother does her teache
That when her husband will unto her reche
She shall for dread tremble / quake and cry
And him withstand / and how that she shall lie
In many manner wise as should a maid
Upon the night when she first is assayde
Also the mother does her well enfourme
How she shall her demean / and in what form
when that this galaunt her would enforce or stryke
Also suddenly than shall she sterte and syke
As though she wrre cast in cold water deep
Up to the breasts / also she shall weep
But in conclusyon as to the deed
She playneth metely well when she must need
And yet the fader and the mother both
For love and pity angry be and wroth
which that they have upon their daughter young
Supposing that this man has done her wrong
And causes them in presence to be brought
Now has this squyre found that he has sought
Here may ye se one of the gretest pain
For she which with aladde has been forlayne
Or months three may pass and come about
Shall have a baby lapped in a cloute
Oftymes a go then Joys and pleasaunce
To heaviness be turned and penance
And peradventure he shall her after beat
And manace curse and chyde with words great
And never after shall good household keep
So in the lepe he put is for to stepe
And out thereof he never shall depart
Of soro we and heaviness he shall have part
And ever more abide shall in dystres
Ending his days in care and wretchedness
Here ends the enleueth Joy of marriage.
Here begins the twelfth Joy of marriage.


THe twelfth Joy of marriage for to say
Is when ayonge man by many a day
In such a manner comen has and gone
That he in to the lepe has found anon
The straight enter / and also ferthermore
He has her found whom he demanded fore
And he some other might percas have had
But for no thing he would / and he is glad
Of this / for as him seems he has sete
His love so well / that no man could do beat
And that he was so happy her to find
which so good is / and mete unto his mind
And peradventure such a man is he
As by her council will well ruled be
So that when any wight has for to do
with him / he says I shall go speak unto
The good wife of our house / and if she will
It shall be done / and if so be she nyll
In no wise shall the matter take effect
As pleases her she will grant or reiecte
And here it comes to the point anon
I put the case he be a gentylmon
And that his prince an army do prepare
with which he is commanded for to fare
Then if the wife it will for the shall he go
And if she do replye / he shall not so
Unto the wife / thus may he say perchance
My love I must me spedely auaunce
Straight to the kings army well arrayed
And she shall say sir / be ye not afraid
what will ye go and cause you to be slain
How should we do yfye come not again
ye think but lyte what shall become of me
And in good point / than should your children be
But shortly for to speak / if it her please
He shall go forth / and sometime for her ease
Ofhym the house she can deliver clean
when that her lyketh best / here what I mean
For whyder it pleases her him out to send
He shall go quyckely forth / and there an end
Unto such saints as she auo we has made
which to perform for her he will be glade
And whyder yt it be wind / snow hayle or rain
Upon her bidding shall he go certain
And so may be a galaunt herynge this
The which her lemman or her lover is
And knows the entres of the house about
Well understanding that this man is out
Desiring with her for to speak and talk
Withouten taryenge will to her walk
For longer in no wise may he abide
But on the night / when come is the tide
In to her house he enters secretly
And where as the good man was wont toly
This homely galaunt boldly lies him down
Which has god wot a great devotion
For to accomplysshe his desires and will
And this good wife her keeps close and still
The which dysdeyneth for to cry or call
Right well in paeyence she takes all
For when some woman sees a man does take
Great pain and labor only for her sake
Of pity never will she him refuse
And though that she should deye he shall her use
She has a bow that by her stands bent
And he artyllery that must be spent
It happeth often he in the house abides
And in a corner preuyly him hydeth
When that a little dog does at him bay
And if the good man / what is that will say
The wife will answer / sir it is a ratte
That he does bark / or else at the catte
For often times before he has done so
Thus will she say with many words mo
So shortly for to speak this man is trapped
And in the lepe he closed is and lapped
She makes him the children for to bear
When they would play / and dady here and there
Also she causes him to take and hold
Her spyndell and the thredes to unfold
Upon the saturday / when she does rele
And she will chyde if he do not well
Now has he found a thing which he has sought
And upon him newly does fall a thought
For war begins in that regyon
And every man unto the strongest town
Will draw that he can find to save his life
But he at home abide must with his wife
And may not leave her wherefore he perchance
Is take prisoner / and great fynaunce
Then must he pay / or else in prison dwell
This can this man of care and sorrow tell
Which in his husholde keeping he has found
For night and day he must trotte on the ground
Uytayles to get / or for some other need
And shortly for to say so does he speed
That his poor body never shall have rest
Unto the time he put be in his chest
Then falls he in sykenes and in aege
Whereby with him is past lust and courage
Well less than prayed shall he be always
And like a foulecouer be cast away
Which is not wroth to occupy that craft
So is all Joy and pleasure him beraft
The wife has daughters two or three or mo
Which would be married / and they be not so
Wherefore they praise this good man but a lyte
But have him in dysdayne / and great dyspyte
In to the gout he falls seek and sore
And help himself so shall he never more
For evil pains such as he has had
Which with his wife / has thus ben ouerlad
Than may this poor man his sins weep
Within the lepe / where he is closed deep
Out of the which he never shall depart
But still remain / and ever take his part
Of Joys such as be in marriage
Which he from youth has found unto his aege
And yet him fallen is more heaviness
For he ne dare cause for to sing a mess
Ne make his last will and testament
But if his wife there unto will consent
For he to her so buxome is and bond
That body and soul he puts in her hand
Thus vsyth he his life in languysshynge
Always / and eke a sorrowful ending
He shall sustain and wretchedly his days
This man shall end withouten mirth or plays
And all is the cause of his good wife
That causes him so to be caytyfe
Here ends the twelfth Joy of marriage.
Here begins the.xiii. Joy of marriage


The.xiii. Joy of marriage is so
That when that he which wedded is also
Within the lepe has been and dwelled there
With his good wife well six or seven year
Or else peradventure more or less
The certaynte whereof I do but guess
And demeth he is sure by his advise
That he has found a woman good and wise
With whom he rested has in great pleasaunce
And he a gentylman may be perchance
Which for to get him worship and honor
Would put him forth / to do his best devour
Then to his wife he will declare and say
My love I must ride out on my Journey
To such a land nyghe to the realm of france
Where I may win great fame and valyaunce
And she there with often would him clyppe and kys
Weeping and syghynge / and say O what is this
Alas my love will ye depart so soon
Leuynge me here with all this charge to done
And in no wise ye understand certain
If ones or never ye shall come home again
Both night and day she does upon her side
All that she can to cause him to abide
My love says he. I must of very need
This Journey take on me how so I speed
Or else shall I lose / both the fees and wage
All that I have and eke mine heritage
The which I hold / and with gods grace
I shall come home again in little space
And in adventure he gooth over the se
With such a prince or in a great arm
To get him honor / or for chyualry
So of his wife than takes he congye
Which makes all the dole that one can make
At such departing for her husbands sake
For if he be such one as loves honor
There is no wife love ne peramour
That from the deed of arms may him hold
If he an hardy person be and bold
Turn we again to this noble man anon
The which upon his vyage forth is gone
And unto god he recommaundeth all
His wife and his children in especyall
It happeth that he over the sea gooth clear
And where his enemies are he draws nere
His fortune may so by adventure vary
That years three or four he shall out tarry
How he is deed the wife than has herd say
Whereof she makes sorrows night and day
So great that for to here it is marvel
But always may she not so weep and wayle
For blyssed be god / she does appece at last
And so it happeth that she is married fast
Unto an other man / and does forgete
Her old husband / and all the Joys great
And love / that she unto him bare in her mind
Here may ye se / that she can torn and wind
For now the solace and the pleasures old
And fervent love with her be waxen cold
Which to her husband she was wont to make
And reason why / for she a new has take
The folks then / such as before have seen
The manner of the delynge them between
Says that this new man she loves more
Than that she did her husband here to fore
But so it is as fortune does constrayne
Her other husband comes home again
Which old and feeble grown is to se
For always at his pleasure was not he
And when he to his country draws nere
Of news hastily he does enquere
Both of his wife / and of his children all
Great doubt he has / how it is with them all
Supposing they be deed or else grieved
Some otherwise which he would were releued
And prays god them for to save and keep
Full pytously well nigh in point to weep
And it may happen well in the same hour
That this man prayed devoutly foro socure
He which the wife so wedded late again
Enbraceth her fast in his arms twain
Than hereth he how that they married were
But how he pleased is such news to here
I trow the sorrow of Abraham and the pain
Was not so great / which his sone should have slain
Ne yet the sorrow of Jacob and his sone
To his were like / ne none under the son
For Tantalus which cheyned lies in hell
Can not of greter pain and sorrow tell
Than this poor man which does him self so cast
In such a sorrow as shall endure and last
Perpetuelly / which he shall not recure
Ne yet forgete / but in the same endure
And other while the children have great shame
To se their mother / brought in such defame
And never shall they mary one ne other
Of many a year / for mysrule of the mother
It fortune may / sometime that in battle
As it does often / some man does not prevail
But at askarmysshe / slain is cruelly
Or in a field mine auctour says / for why
Often happeth it / that he which has the right
Shall vaynquysshed be / or else put unto flight
I put case that this man gooth to his wife
And in his ire will make debate and strife
With her and with her husband wedded new
Now what a vengeance hereof may ensewe
He comes home with swerdes snarpe and bright
And peradventure late within the night
Which fyndeth them together both in bed
Than swereth he by the blood that Ihesus bledde
They shall be slain withouten any remedy
And they arise both all hastily
A fore that he the doors can up break
And right pyteously to him does speak
Alas my love she says / what do ye now
I wend ye had been deed I make auow
By many a man it has benshewed and said
That ye were slain and in your grave ylayde
But for that I would know the certaynte
I was unmarried more than years three
And such a sorrow made I night and day
That all my wit and reason fill away
Helples I was / long time in woe and care
And god it wot full evil did I fare
That ye were deed / each man said out of doubt
And I ne could well bring ye world about
Wherefore my friends aduysed me to mary
And so I did / for what cause should I tarry
Ye never sent me word / how that ye did
But ye always your counceyle fro me hyde
And as this wyly woman stood and talked
The newly wedded husband / softely stalked
And took a bow in hand / and did it bend
And boldly said / he would his place defend
Than said the wife unto her husbands both
Good gentle syrs / yfye would not be wroth
But well agree / I trust you both to please
My self / and you at every time well ease
The old husband thus knowy^ge of their deed
Departs suddenly / for he must need
With shame enough / and hastes him away
And they within the house fast laugh and play
And after this so seek he is and sad
That he within a while is waxen mad
Wherefore I say / he that may fortune so
As did this man which would for honor go
The way in to the lepe of marriage
Straight has he found as bird in to the cage
How be it he before was not so wise
Of so great Ieoperdyes to take advise
So shall he led his life and him enable
To be a sole / and mete to bear the babble
And at the last in pains grievously
He shall his days end / and wretchedly
Here ends the.xiii. Joy of marriage.
