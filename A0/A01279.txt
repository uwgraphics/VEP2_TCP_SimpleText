The Revelation of Antichrist.

father the (...).

Richard Brightwell unto ye christian read Philip.

GRace / mercy and the peace of god passinge all vndsto^dige which is the jure
confidence of remission of sin in the blood of Christ / and perfaite trust
of the heretage of everlasting liffe in the same Christ our lord be with the
Christen Reader / and with all that call upon the name of Jesus. All be it
there was nothing that Christ spoke being present among us in this mortal
liffe but it had a quicknes sprete / and conforte: Ioannis. vi^
yet chefly of all this warning precessed (in mi^iudgeme^t) all other words /
where he exhorted us / while we had light to beleve in the light / that we
might be the children of light. And again / yet a little while / Joan. xi^.
is the light with you walk while ye have light lest the darkness come on you:
for he ye walks in ye dark wo^teth not whether he goes / who is this light
that we are exhorted to beleve in? truly it is Christ as saint Ioa^ does
testifye. He was ye true light yt lighteneth all me^ / which come in to ye
world. Joan. ^
To beleve in this light makes us ye children of light / and ye sure
i^heritours with jesus christ. Eve^ now have we cruel adversaryes which set up
their bristles sainge / why then shall we do no good works? To these we answer
as Christ did to the peeple in the.vj. of saint Joan. Joan. v^
Which axed him what they should do that they might work / the works of God?
Jesus answered and said un to them. This is the work of god / yt ye beleve on
him / whom he has sent and after it follows / verily verily I say unto you /
be that beleveth on me has everlastinge liffe. To this also co^dessendeth
saint Joan in his epistle sainge. i, Ioannis. v^
These things have I written un to you that beleve on the name of the son of
God / that you may surely know / how that you have eternal liffe / what is the
name of the son of god? Trvely his name is Jesus that is to say a savior /
therefore thou must beleve that he is a savior. But what a vayleth this? ^ovi.
ii.
The devils do thus beleve and tremble. They know that he is the son of god.
^ath. viii.
And said un to him crying. O Jesus the son of god / what have we to do with
the They know that he has redeemed mankind by his passion / and labored to let
it / ^ath. xxvii.
for when Pilate was set down to geve judgment / his wiffe sent un to him
saying / have thou nothing to do with that just man / fore I have suffered
many things this day in my sleep about him. No doubt she was vexed of the
devil to thentent that she should persuade her husband to geve no sentence upon
him / so that the longer Satan over mankind might have had jurisdiction. They
know that he has supressed sin and death / as it is written / death is
consumed in to victory. ^. xiii. ^re. ii. ^in. xvi
Death where is thy stinge? hell where is thy victory? the stinge of death is
sin. The strength of sin is the law. i. Joan. v^^
But thanks be un to god which has geven us victory / through our lord
Jesus Christ / Roma. viii.
which by sin damned sin in the flessh / for god made him to be sin for
us (that is to say a sacryfice for our sin / and so is sin taken in many
places of the.ij. testamentes) which knew no sin / ii. Corinth. v*
that we by his meanis / should be that rightewesnes which before god is allowed.
It is not therefore sufficient to beleve that he is a savior and redemer: but
that he is a savior and redemer unto the / and this can thou not confess /
except thou knowleg thy self to be a sinner / for he that thinks him silf no
sinner / neadith no savior and redemer. Mathei. ix.
And of these Christ says I came not to call rightewesmen (that is to say them
that think the^ selves no sinners / Psalm. xxxiii. Roma. iii.
for in very deed there is none righteous / no not one) but sinners to
repentance. For they which are strong have no nead of a physician / Math. ix.
but they that are secke. There fore knowledge thy silf a sinner yt thou may
be justified. Not that the enumberinge of thy sins can make the rightewesse.
But rather a greater sinner / ye and a blasphemer of ye holy name of god / as
thou may se in Cain which said that his sins where greater then that he
might receave / Gene. iii^.
forgevenes of God and so was reprobate. Thou must keep therefore an order in
thy justification / first co^sideringe what the law requires on the / which
truly binds ye now to as much as though thou were in the state of innocencye
/ and commands the to be with out concupiscence which is original sin.
Condempninge the infantes (that are not baptized in his blood) for this
original sin (yet could not they do with all) which God of justice would not
do / except they had transgressed his law and were bound to be with out this
co^cupisce^ce / if thou woldist reason / why God does thus / take Paul's
answer. Roma. ix.
O man what art thou which disputest with God? Know this that it is god which
geveth the sentence with who^ is none iniquite but all justice and mercy. How
be it if thou ask me / why he binds us also (which are come to perfaite
understanding) to that which is impossible for us to accomplysch? Thou shall
have saint Augustyns answer / which says in the second book that he wrote to
Hierome / that the law was geve^ us / that we might know what to do and what
to eschew / to the^tent that when we se our selves not able to do that which
we are bound to / nor avoyde the contrary yt then we may know what we shall
pray for and of who^ we shall ask this stre^gthe so yt we may say unto our
father. Good father command what so ever it pleases ye And geve us the grace
to fulfill that thou co^maundest. And when we perceave that we cannot fulfill
his will / yet let us confess yt the law is good and holy / and that we are
sinners and carnal sold under sin / Roma. vij
but let us not here stick for now are we at hell gates / and truly should fall
in to utter desperatio^ except God did bring us again shewinge us his
Gospel and promise / saying fear not little flock for it is your fathers
pleasure to geve you a kingdom. Luce. xij.
If we receave the witness of men / ye witness of god is greatter / for this is
ye witness of god / which he testified of his son. He yt beleveth on the son
of god has ye witness in hi^ silf. i. Ioannis. v
He yt beleveth not god has made hi^ a lyare be cause he beleved not the
record that God gave of his son. And this is that record / how yt God has
geven unto us eternal liffe / and this liffe is in his son / j. Pet. ij.
Esate. liij. Philip. ii.
which was made our best / bearinge our sins upon his own back / made
obedient unto the death offeringe up our iniquites (as a sacrifice) un to his
father / being our mediator and Atonement betwixt his father and us. i.
Joan. j ^. Corin. i^.
Made of God for us / wisdom / rithtewesnes / holiness / and redemption /
fulfillinge the law for us. So that sin has no power over us nether can
condemn us / for our satisfaction is made in Christ which died for us yt were
weked / Roma. ^^
and naturallye ye children of wrath even as well as ye other. But god which is
rich in mercy through the great love where with he loved us / even when we were
dead through sin / has quyckened us with Christ / and with him has raised
us up / and with him has made us sit in hevenly things through Jesus
Christ / for to show in times to come ye exceading riches of his grace in
kindness to us ward through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye made safe through
faith / and that not of your selves / for it is the gift of God / and comes
not of works / lest any man should boste him silf. Ioannis.l.
But of his fulness we have all received / and favor for favor / that is to
say / the father of heaven has favored us for his sons sake / and not for
our own deservinges (as when we se a man favored and loved for an other
man's sake) And has promised unto us freely the enheritance of heven. Iacobi.
i.
This promise must we beleve with sure trust and waver not / for he that
douteth is like the waves of the sea / toste of ye wind and carried with
violence. Nether let that man think that he shall receave any thing of god
This gospel and promise must we look after with unfeigned hope / Hebre. vj.
wherein be cause we should nothing doubt / God has added an oath unto his
promise / to show unto ye heirs of promise ye stablenes of his counsel / yt by
those two i^mutable things (in which it was impossible that god should lie) we
might have perfect consolacion which have fled for to hold fast the hope that
is set forth before our faces / which hope we have as an ancre of the soul
both sure and steadfast. For this promise must we pray daily unto our father
desyringe to be loosed from this body and to be with Christ / Philip. i. ii.
Corin. v.
for we sigh in this bodey desyreng to be clothed with our mansion which is
from heven. i. Joan. iij. Joan. xij.
And we know that then we shall be like him / for we shall se him as he is /
and shall be the perfect children of lighe. Hebreo.ij.
Therefore dear brothren we ought with all mind and affection to attend unto
tho things which we have hard lest we be spilt / ij. Petri.ij.
for if god spared not the Angels that sinned but cast them down in to hell /
and put them in chains of darkness there to be kept unto judgment. And every
transgression and disobedience / Hebro.ij.
received a just recompense to reward / how shall we escape if we despise so
great health? Hebreo.iij.
Take heed dear brothren / that there be in none of you an evil heart in
vnbeleve / yt he should depart from the lyvinge God / but exhort one an other
daily / left any of you were hard hearted and be deceaved with sin. Remember
yt Christ exhorted us to walk while we have light lest that the darkness come
upon us / Joan.xij.
for he that walks in the darkness / Joan.xi.
knows not whether he goes. If a man walk in the day he stombleth not /
because he seith the light of this world / if ama^ walk in the night he
stombleth be cause there is no light in him This day and light (as we have
said before) is christ which says / I am come a light in to the world /
Joan. x^.
that woe so ever beleve on me should not bide in darkness / who is this
darkness? truly ye Philosophers sey yt if a man know on of ye co^traryes he
must needs know the other / but the light and the darkness are contrary / and
Christ is the light therefore it is necessary that ye contrary to Christ (that
is to say Antichrist should be the darkness. And there are diverse Antichrists
and adversaryes to god ye father / to christ / and to their sprite / Gen ^.iij.
as ye devil / ye flessh / and the world. The devil was ye first and tempted
Eve in paradise which co^sentinge to his temptation persuaded Adam to eat of
the fruit which god sorbade the^ / and so was he the author of ye co^de^pnation
of all Adams posteryte / and there god co^de^pninge the devil gave a promise
of our redemption in christ fayng I will put enmyte be twe^ the and the woman
betwe^ thy sede and her sede. And her sede shall depresse and all to break thy
head / and thou shall lie watchinge the sole of his foot. To this agrees sanct
Peter saying / ^. Petri. v.
your adversary the divill as a roringe lio^ walks about sekinge who^ he
may devour / who^ resist steadfast in ye faith reme^bringe yt ye do but
sulfill ye same affilictio^s which are appointed to your brethren ye are in the
world. This confirms Christ him silf saying unto Peter. Simo^ simo^ / behold
satan has desired you / Luce. xx^.
to sifte you as it were wheat but I have prayed for the yt thy faith fail
not. Nether is it mervell though he do us thus assail / sythge presumed to
t^pte chaste our lord in ye wilderness. ^ath.iiij.
Let us not geve place in this te^ptacio^ / but keep faithfullye our
profession for our high priest (christ Jesus) Hebreo. iil^.
cannot but have co^passio^ on our infirmites / for he was in all points like
tempted / but yet with out sin / let us therefore go boldly unto the seat of
grace yt we may receave mercy / and find grace to help in time of nead / that
we be not tangled with his fair flateringe and delicious entyseme^tes yt
bring eternal da^nacio^ / but yt we be strong in faith prayesinge the
glorious name of god which delyvereth us from all evils. The second is ye
flesh where of it is written. The flesh lusts contrary to ye sprete /
Gala. v:
and the sprete contrary to ye flesh. These are contrary one to ye other so
yt ye ca^ not do yt which ye would. The flesh is called not only ye desires
of the flesh but all things that we do / think or speak / ye our hole
body / soul reason / with ye cheffe and highest powers of them / if they be
not led and gowerned with the sprete of God. The sprete is every outward and
inward work that a man havinge faith and cherite) which are the fruits and
gifts of the sprete) Gala. v.
does work seakinge spiritual things. This sprete bears witness unto our
sprete that we are the children of god / Roma. viij.
for he that has not this sprite of Christ / is none of his kingdom. But is
the bo^d servant of sin / under which he is subdewed and remains captive
under the law. ij. Pet. il. Roma. vi. Roma. vij
But ye dear brothren are made dead as concerning the law / by the body of
Christ / that ye should be coupled to him that is risen again from death / that
we should bring forth fruit unto god / for when we were under the law / the
lusts of sin which were sturred up by ye law reigned in our members / to
bring forth fruit unto death. But now are we delivered from the law / and
dead from it / where unto ne were in bondage that we should serve in anew
conversation of the sprete / and not in the old co^uersatio^ of the letter. We
know that the flesshly mind is enmyte against God. Roma. vij.
For it is not obedient to the law of God nether can be / so that they which
are geven to the flessh can not please god. We know that every man is tempted
/ drawn away / and entyesed of his own concupicence / Iaco. j.
and when this concupiscence and lust has conceaved / she brings forth sin
/ And sin when it is fine sched brings forth death. We know that as long
as we lyve in this world we carye about with us the old man of sin / which
(with out he be with contynuall diligence suppressed and mortifyed) beseageth
the new man with his venom and concupice^ces (which is original sin) planted
as natural ye in him as venom in a serpe^ts toth / sith the^ we can not be
with out this old man of sin (for the which / no man shall be justified in the
sight of god / i. Joan. j
for which Yff we say that we have no sin we are liars / and the truth is
not in us. For the which also / if we profit never so high / yet must we ever
say forgeve us / Math. vj
father our trespases) yet let us do our diligence / calling for the sprete
of god / that this concupiscence reign not in our mortal body ever
knowleginge with a mild heart our iniquites to our father which is in heve^
/ Io. vi
for he is faithful and just / i. Joan. j
to remitte us our sins / and to purge us from all iniquite / through the
blood of Jesus Christ his son.

The third which other alone / or else chesly is counted Antichrist / because he
resists ye personal coming of Christ in the flesh for our redemption /
is the world / of the which it is writhen. If the world hate you / ye know
that it has hated me before you / if you were of the world / the world would
love that yt is his own because ye are not of ye world but i have chosen you
out of the world / therefore hates you the world / and sanct Joan exhortteth
his brothers like a faithful minister of Christ saying. i. Joan.ij.
Se that you love not the world / nether ye things that are in ye world / if
any / man love the world the love of the father is not in him / for all that is
in ye world (as the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes / and the pride
of this lyffe) is not of the father. but of the world. The world in this place
is understand for the^ that are carnal and carnally minded / for these truly
are Antichrists. But how shall we prove that / since sanct Joan seameth
contrary / i. Joan. iiijj
where he says / Derely beloved beleve not every sprete / but prove ye
spretes whether they are of god or no / for many false prophets are gone out
i^ to the world / hereby shall ye know the sprete of god. Every sprete that
confesses that Jesus Christ is come^ in the flessh / is of god And every
sprete which confesses not / that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of
god / and this is that sprete of Antichriste / of whom you have hard how that
he should come / and eve^ now all redye is he in the world what shall we now
say / Does the world confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh? ye
verily / how shall they the^ be Antichrists? Joan. ^.
Truly by sanct Paul's expounding of this place where he says / They confess
yt they know god / but with deeds they deny him / And are abominable / and
disobedient / and unto all good works discommendable. Do they say yt they
know him and deny him in works? ye truly / let us then also note what
sancte Ioa^ says / he yt says I know hi^ / i. Joan. ^.
and keeps not his co^mau^dme^tes / is a liar and the verite is not in him To
know the lord is to have perfect faith in him. And perfect faith has with hi^
sure hope and cherite / and of these follows ye fulfillinge of the
co^mau^dmites necessarylye / Eve^ as the light follows the fire / how be it
here had we n^de to make a division / for ye world has two sorts of
Antichrists. The one sort are in great power and authorite / ye other in
subjection. The one obdurate and reproved / ye other wa^deringe out of the
right way until it shall please the father to draw the^ unto grace. Joan. vi.
The one resisti^ge for subbornesse knowing the truth and so sin against ye
holy ghost / the other only for ignora^cye transgress the precepts / and
these will I not speak of because there come not so great ioperdyes and perels
of the^ / co^mittinge the^ only unto the provision of god / desyringe hi^ /
that his will be fulfilled and to show his glory in them. The first I will
thouch some whate. i. Joan. ij.
Not for to teach them which are chosen of god for they have an oynteme^t of ye
holy ghost and know all things. And need not yt enyman teach the^. But only to
monyssh the^ of yt which ye sprete has taught the^ and that christ him silf
has sewed the^. Math. xxiiij
Christ said yt there should arise salse prophets and false christ's (yt is to
say false anointed) and should deceave many / Man. vi^
and gave his disciples a mark to know the^ sainge he ware of false prophets
which come in shepes clothinge / but in wardly they are raveninge wolves / what
means he by shepes clothinge / truly nothing else but that they should come in
his name / pretendinge great humilite / Math. xxiiij
but what are they in deed? verily raveninge wolves / that is to say bestes of
the belie for their belie is their god / and why come they to you? Philip. iij
truly to dispoyle and rob you / of your goods / promisinge vain pardons /
and delivera^ce from the popes / purgatory / to thente^te that they might lyve
idelly / and in the lusts of the ^^essh by your labors / how shall they be
known. Christ says / By their works shall you know them / Mat. vi^
lay their works to the scripture / and ye should lamente their abominable
lyvinge. But alas you can not / for they will not suffer you to have it / they
keep yt meryard from you yt you should rule al things with all They burn ye
gospel of god ye and very Christ him self / for he is nothing but his word as
he testifies him silfe sainge. Joan. vii.
I am yt which I speak unto you / and again. Joan. j.
In the beginning was the word / and the word was with god and god was the
word. And why do they hyed this word of light from you? Joan. iij
No doubt be cause their works are evil for every man that does evil hates
the light / nether comes to ye light / lest his works should be reproved / but
he that works the verite / comes to te light / yt his works may be openly
seen because they are done of God. They pretend to keep it from you for pure
love / be cause you should take no hurt of it / nether fall in to heresye /
Gala. iiii.
but they are gelyous over you amysse / ye they would clean exclude you from
Christ and make you follow them. And because they would the more easyly bow you
to their yoke they begin be times / compellinge you being very children
of.xij. years to keep their fastes which they prescrybe / and if you eat ij
meals in these prescripte days then must you to a pressed and confess a great
transgression / fromittinge youreselves on to him / what so ever he will
enjoin unto you and call it penance necessary / for your soulle health. O
lord God what sotle illusions have they invented to reign in men's
consciences / ye and to begine so sone with them / truly this was a far cast
of belly wisdom if it were not the devil him silf that imagened it. ii. Timo.
iij
Paul reioyseth in Timothe (exhortinge him to stond stiffly in those things
which he has learned) that of a child he has known the holy scripture which
may instruct hi^ unto health through the faith which is in Christ Jesus /
shewinge the fruit and profit of it saying. All scripture which is enspired
from god / is profitable to instruction / to reprovinge and correctinge and to
the bringinge vpe / which is in rightewesnes / so that the man of god may be
hole and consummate / prepared unto every good work. If it be thus profitable
I mervell why they do not suffer men to have it / how be it they know very well
that when a cloked lie comes to the light it vanisshethe a way / and even so
their colored kingdom if scripture were known would sone be disparsed lik
vapore and most vanite. In the mean ceason. I will show the an evide^t reason
that thou may know with out doutinge which is the very Antichriste and this
argument may be grounded of their furious persequution / which Paul does
confirm writing to the Galathians. Gala. iiij.
We (dear brethren) are the children of promission as Isaac was / not the
sons of the bond woman as Ismael / but even as he that was borne after ye
flesh did persequute him that was borne after ye sprete eve^ so now. Mark
Paul's reason / by Isaac are signified the elect / and by Ismael the
reprobate. Isaac did not persequute Ismael / but contrary Ismael did
persequute Isaac. Now let us make our reason. (...)
All they that do persequute are Ismael / the reprobate / and Antichrists. But
all the Popes / Cardinals / Busshopes and their adherentes / do persequute.
Therefore all the Popes / Cardinals / Busshopes and their adherentes / be
Ismael / the reprobate / and Antichrists. Mayor
I wene our sillogismus be well made and in the first figure. The mayor is
Paul's saying. Even as he that was borne after the flesh / Gala. iiij
did persequute him that was borne after the sprete / eve^ so now And of this
may thou have many examples in the testamentes / as Jacob and Esau Jacob was
the chosen / Roma. ix Malach. j Genesi. xxvij.
and Esau was forsaken / and did persequute his brother Jacob / and not the
contrary / likwisse David was chosen of God / and fled from Saul / ye and
from his own son Absolon. i. Regum xix ji. Reg. xv
Here might Ienumbre all the Prophets which did never persequute / but ever
were persequuted ye and many of them killed / It was never read that the chosen
did persequute any.
let us descend unto Christ / and we shall se that he was no sooner borne / then
persequuted of herod and compelled to fle in to Aegipte / Math. ij
and his persequution never ceased until he was brought to death / the
apostles were all persequuted / beten / presoned / and at the length killed. And
I think verily that so long were the successors of the apostles good
christen / when they were persequuted and martyred / and no longer. So
impossible it is yt the word of the cross should be with out affliction.
Simeon prophesied and said unto Marye the mother of Christ / behold this child
is put in to ye destruction / Luck. ij.
and in to the resurrection of many of Israel. And in to ye sign which shall be
resisted and spoken against. Not that he should resist them / but that he should
be resisted and ever caused to fly / for the world was never so faithful /
but the more part were weked. Math. xiii.
I wonder they fear not the parable of Christ where he gave commandment they
should suffer the wedes to grow among the corn until the hervest expoundinge
ye wedes to be the children of Satan and reprobate persons / for now a days
if a man beleve not as they will have him / he shall be burned / be it in case he
were the very adversary of Christ (but I know none of them that will go to the
fire) should they then burn him and Christ say nay? Ye forsooth / for they
can set Christ to scole / and say this is better / ywes Paul had never been
good corn / if he had been destroyed when he was wedes and the adversarye of
Christ. Let them beware lest they be ordered as Saul was / ij. Regum. xv
which was commanded to destroy the king of Amelech and all his goods / how
be it he spared the kings liffe and ye fairest goods and catelles making
sacrifice with them unto God / which if belly wisdom were any thing worth should
seame a mervelous good dead / how be it / it did displease God so sore that he
said unto Samuel / he repented that he had made Saul king because Saul had
forsaken him and had not in deed fulfilled his words. And therefore he was
depryved of his kingdom and ran far in to the indignation of God. Even so I
fear me these Antichrists which presume to contrary Christ's words will lose
the kingdom of glory which was prepared for the faithful before the
foundations of the world were cast. Ephesi. i.
Now let us prove the minor for of these.ij. parts follows the conclusion of
necessyte.

The minor is / that all Popes / Cardinals / Busshopes and their adherentes
do per sequute. Minor
Needs this any probation. I think some of you have proved it. I ensuere you
they are as merciful as the wolf is on his pray they were ordened to bliss
men. ii. Corinth. x i. Corin. xiij
But they curse as the devil were in them. Paul says that he has power in
to edifyinge and not in to destruction. But I wot not of whom these bloody
bestes have their authorite which do so much rejoice in cursinge / and
destruction. i. Corin. v
We read how Paul did excommunicate the Corinthia^ (and treuly for a great
transgression) to thentent that he might be ashamed of his iniquite. And
desired again the Corinthia^s / to receave him with all cherite / ij. Corin.
ii.
but that the Apostles did curse any man truly we can not read in scripture /
for Christ commanded them to bliss those that cursed them / and to pray for
those that persequuted them / sainge unto them. In this world you shall have
affliction / and in me you shall have peace. Joan. xvj.
But the Popes / Cardinals / with all their ragma^s roolle have none
affliction. Therefore other they are none of Christ's flock / or else Christ him
silf is a liar. ^i. Timo. iij
Sancte Paul says that all which will godly lyve in christ shall suffer
persequution / but the Pope with his adherentes suffer not / but rather
persequute. Therefore they lyve not godly in christ or else Paul thou art a
liar for thou exceptest none. I think our minor be sufficiently proved / how
be it thou may not say so / for truly they will separate you from their
sinagoges ye to this furyous madness are they come ye if they kille you (as
christ prophesied) they will think them selves / Joan. xvj
to do honor and pleasure to god / and this shall they do unto you because
they have not known my father another me / Math. x
how be it let us not fear them that kille the body and have no farther power
/ but rather him that after he has filled the body has power to cast the soul
in to everlastinge fire. And to him let us pray with one accord that he will
shorten ^hese parylous times / ^. Timo. iiij
and all though we be sinners / worthily abiecte / and clean unworthy this
godly deliverance / Danie. ix
for we have sinned and committed iniquite / and have departed / lord / from
thy co^maundmentes. Yet consider good father thy holy testament and promise for
thou art rightuous be we never so weked and must needs fulfill thy promise for
thy truth sake. Psalm. lxxiij
Arise good lord and avenge thine own cawse forgete not these abominable
blasphemes which this folisshe and bestly people clean ignorant of thy justice
/ and sekinge their own righteousness / do cast upon the continually / they are
thy enymyes. And speak odyous and weked words against thy glorious son
Jesus christ whom thou have geven us / and whom thou haste made our
satisfaction / iustificacion / and redemption) vaynly presuminge upon their
own works and merits. Extend thy hand (oh lord) against their presumptuous
mi^des How greatly have they prevayled against thy holy son? How long shall
thine enimye provoke the? Shall he continue resistinge thy name perpetuallye?
Remember ye holy congregation whom thou have chosen from the beginning. ii.
Timo. ^^
Suffer them not to be brought in to this strong illusion which for aboundence
of sin thou have sent in to the world / that they might be condemned / which
have not beleved the truth but had pleasure in iniquite. Selyver the souls of
thy chosen from these bestes / that thou may be known to be very god / and
that thy name may be glorified through all the world / that they which by thy
sufferance and lenite have not be brought unto repentance / Roma. ij.
may feall thy scourge and be compelled (as Pharao was) to dimitte thy chosen
children / Exodi. xvi
and to knowledge thy power and omnipotencye. And that we may serve the with a

Danielis. viij. ANd after their kingdoms. Transgressio^ and sin invadinge
and cominge upon the^ / there shall sto^d a king mighty in faces / and
understanding rydles and his power shall be strengthed and not in his own power
and might. And he shall corrupt mervelous things. And he shall prospere and
do / and shall corrupt strong things / and the people which are holy. And he
shall be after his own opinion. And deceate shall be directed and prosper in his
hand. And he shall be exalted in his own heart. And in his prosperity he shall
corrupt many / and he shall resist the prince of all princes. And shall be
consumed with out hand.
FIrst they are not to be allowed that understand this and soche other places of
the prophets / and would have them only verefied upon one person. For they are
clean ignorante of the prophets manner / which are wont by one person to
signifye the hole body of a realm. And therefore evyll they do apply this
Antichriste (who^ Paul do the call the man of sin / i^. These. ij
and the son of perdition) to one person / sith that he would that by
Antichriste should be meanyde the hole body and multitude of wicked me^ with
all their succession and imperye / for so in the.viij. of Daniel a ram does
signifye the kingdom of the Perses. And a got the kingdom of the Grecyans.
Danie. vli^
Where as he says that after the end of four kingdoms (of the which the
last is the Romans mighty with sword) this king shall rise / trewly he
towchyth that / that the tyranny of the Pope did begin after that the
imperye of Rome began to decay / ye of the imperye of Rome and in the imperye
it is spronge. And is succedyd and entered / in the stead of the imperye / as
it is evydent by all stories / and this present experience does also show it us
/ which also the apostle did prophecye before in the.ij. of the second pistle
to the Tessalonyans saying. Only he ye holds let him now hold / ^. Thessalonians. ii
until it be taken out of the way / and then shall that wicked be vtteryd and
so furthe. The name of the imperye of Rome was translated to the Germans /
when there was no imperye in deed / how be it this was an occasion by the which
this man was elevatyd and set up / above all kings / above all Busshopes /
above heven and earth / and so fixed and stablisshed his kingdom in his own
hand and power / cownterfeytinge (to stablisshe this lie) a bull both false
and folyssh which was of the gift of Constantine. Danie. viij


Tra^gression and sin invadinge and comi^ge apo^ the^ / that is (as Sanct
Hiero^ did say) when iniquyte and vice do increase / teachinge manyfestly that
this is a kingdom of the furye of God / and shall come for sin. And Paul
for the same cawse bringith in the son of perdition / saying they have not
receavid the love of the truth / that they might have been saved. ij. Tess. ij*
And therefore God shall send them strong delusion that they should beleve lies:
that all they might be damned / which beleved not the truth but had pleasure
in unrighteous / the apostle does sufficiently express in these words what
manner of vnrightewesnes and offenses they are / which also Daniel in the hebrew
does call peschaim / Danie. viij
which word has a notable propertye and secret signification / for it does
signifye a brekinge of the commandment / an offense / and a departinge from
the faith / iiij. Reg. i
as in the.j. of the fourth book of kings. Moab departyde from ye faith of
Israel. Esaie. j.
And in the first of Esai I have norysshid up and exalted children / and they
have transgressed my commandment As it is also said in the.v. Psalm, Psalm. v
According to te multitude of their ungodliness / and vices / expel them. x.
These. ii
And Paul in this place copiously does say that they will not receave the
love of truth / and also that they will not beleve the truth / but beleve
lies. Ever meaning the vice of doctrines / opinions / and departinge from the
faith / as he said before / except there come a departinge first. j. Timoth.
iiij
And in the.iiij. to Timothe. The sprete speakyth evidently that in the latter
tymys / some shall depart from the faith / and shall gyve head to spretes of
error / and again They shall turn their hearing from the truth. The
truth in this place (according unto his manner) he callyth ye faith of Christ
which also the hebrew tongue does / devydinge the truth by contradiction from
hypocrisy and faynid godliness / Ephesi. iiij.
as in the.iiij. to the Ephesians let us follow the truth in love and in all
things grow in him. And again / put on that new man which after a goodly
wise is shapen in rightewesnes and true holiness: reprovinge the rightewesnes of
vanyte and glorious superstition.

Danie. viij
Daniel therefore callyth not this word / ^eschaim any manner of sin / but those
special and cheff sins which resist / and fight against the truth and the
faith / as are the trustyng in works / superstitiousnes / and ceremonyse by
the which we decay from the faith / which alone does truly iustifye and make
holy / as Paul does warn before in ye.iij. to the Collossians / and in many
other places. Collos. iij
And shows that he prophesid before that they would not receave the love of
truth that is to say / ii. These. ij
they shall not love the truth which is in faith / Exodi. xvi Psalm. cv^
but with the children of Israel they shall abhor this light meat / and
desire flessh / that is to say / they shall be tournyd to fables and men's
traditions / wherefore we can apply these iniquites to none of the old
heretics. But only to the traditions of men / and wicked justice for the old
heretics did contend and strive in the holy scripture. But this king shall
regne with out scripture by his own traditions and doctrines. Danie. viij
Therefore Daniel says that transgressions shall darken them. And all the hole
scripture / chefly Paul / does impute this blindness / darkness / and
ignorancye / to nothing else but to the ungodly and wicked presumption of our
own justice and works as it is evident to them which read his epistles.
Ioannis. iii.
And Christ for that cawse callyth him silf the light that the faith in him
does lighten and justify all men.

Therefore it is clear that this king should be after christ was preachid / and
against the lighteni^g of the gospel / with the which the world was illuminate
/ for where he says that they should be darkened with trangressions / it is to
be supposid that thy should be lightenyd before which can not be verefied in
those kingdoms that were before Christ / for they could not be darkenid which
were never lightened / another could they decline from the right way which
never walked in it. But it is meanid of those times in the which Christ also
did prophesye abomination to come / in a manner with the same words / saying.
D^^ / xxiiii.
Be cawse iniquite shall have the upper hand / the love of many shall abate.
ij. Cess. ij
And Paul says / that all they might be damned which beleved not the truth /
But had pleasure in vnrightewesnes. ij. Petre ii
And Petre in the.ij. of his second pistle does reprove with most sharp
words the returninge again of them to their vomet which shall be in the last
times. And almost he only of all the other does expound and declare what
iniquite it is that shall abound / and with which men shall be darkenyd sayng.
There were false prophets among the people even as there shall be false
teachers among you which prevely shall bring in damnable sects / even
deniynge the lord that has bought them / and bring on their ^wne heddes
swyfte damnation / and many shall follow their damnable ways / by which the
way of truth shall be evil spoken of / and through coveteousnes shall they with
fained words make Merchandyse of you. Truly here Petre towchith the master
shuppes / Bisshoprekes and (as they call it) the administratyon and offices of
the church / and shows that this mischeff shall come by their ministeringe
which sit in the stead of God / and ought to ruel the people in his word.
Therefore we have the princes and heddes of the chirch the authors of these
evylles.

Trewly this is the plage of God to send operacyons of error / and false
prophets for it is the scourge of mercy to send pestilence / batell / hunger /
and soch other bodily evilles. But to take away the word of health / and to
send the veno^ of error / that is the most extreme and last token of the
wrath of god. Danie. viii
Daniel might seem to have spoken of ye Turk in whose impery / vice and
iniquite have darkenyd ye people / ii. Pet. ij.
except yt Peter had tawght us to understand it of ye rule and lordshuppe
which is exercised in the people of god / and of the^ which sit in the stead
of doctores and bisshopes. Dani. ix
As also Daniel does she we afterward yt he speakyth of soch / as in the old
people were the false Prophets. These things do nothing parteyne unto ye
Turk which despisinge baptime and the gospel is another the people of god /
another yet cownted among the^ / as they are which have Busshopes ruelinge
among them / let this then be our first supposition / that this king shall
be as greatt / as other the king of the Perses / or of the Grecyans / or of
the Romans. And that the shall regne in teachinge men in the people of Christ
contrary to the lighteninge of the gospel.

For our enteringe in to this vision let us co^sidere the words of Petre. And
who seith not that these iniquites in every point do agree with the shepardes of
the chirch of Rome? ij. Pet. ij.
To whom should Peter speak but to his own Romans / of who^ his books were
received / and where his authorite was of most value? Did not Moses and the
Prophets speak un to their own people? As Saint Paul says in the third to
the Romans / Roma. iij.
we know that what so ever the law says / he says it to them which are
under the law. And he says there shall be among you / whom meanith he but the^
which hear him and know him. Therefore these words touch us / which are under
the Babylon and captivity of Rome / and in us it must be fulfillid that Daniel
/ Christ / Petre / Paul / Judas / and Joan in the Apocalipses did prophesye.

Have we not now many years suffered false teachers / which suppressinge the
gospel have thaught us their own traditions and learninges? All Bisshopes /
Shepardes and Devines / are here noted which all are run in to one madness /
to exalt the Decrees of the Pope and to teach them un to men / with what a full
and notable signification does he speak these words / which prevely shall
bring in damnable sects / ij. Petri. i^
ye Greek word has a great mystery / for it signifiyth that under the
doctrine of godliness (which they shall feign) they shall being in ungodliness /
mingelinge by their secret deceites their own traditions with the gospel /
for they shall not deny the gospel but they shall so wrest it by their
inventio^s glosses and additions / and bring up soch statutes / and
constitutions / by a little and a little that it be not perceaved / that they
shall clenelede the people out of the high way of faith / in to sects of
works with the which they shall destroy and corrupt the gospel / that at the
length it shall be clean un profitable to teach the faith. So in time past the
false Prophets did not deny the name of the lord / but rather did come in
his name / whom Christ paintith in ye. xxiiij of Matthew on this manner. Dat.
xxiiii.
There shall rise false Prophets and false Christ's / and shall deceave many.
Many shall come in my name sainge. I am Christ. And again / if they say behold
here is Christ or there beleve them not. What signifiyth here and there but
sects of perdition? What is this perdition / (...) the destruction of the
faith and the gospel? Ephe. iiij.
So also Paul in the.iiij. to ye Ephesians does call these sects and
doctrine of works where by they lay a wait for us to deceave us / as it were
a deceitful cominge to deceave / because that the wickede which go about to
deceave come un to the people with crafty and sotle sermones / by the word of
god other wrested into their porposse / or else darkenyd by their own doctrines
and sclawnders which are set in the way / soch as the woman in the.ix. of the
Proverbes does figure sitting in the hige place of the city. Proverb. ix.


And Paul in the last to the Romans says. Roma. xvj
Mark them which cawse division and geve occasions of evil covnterfettinge
the doctrine which ye have learned: what are these divisions but those which
Petre callith sects. ij. Petri. ij Dat. xxiiii.
And Christ him silf / behold here is Christ / Roma. xvj ij. Petri. i^ Math.
xxiiiij. Roma xvj ii. Pet. ij.
behold there is Christ? What meanith this / evil occasions / but that which
Petre callith perdition / and that Christ hi^ silf callith deceavinge and
seductio^? what signifies this cou^tersettinge of doctrine but that which
Peter callith ye prevely bringi^ge in of sects. And Christ callith it ye
comi^ge in his name? Mark the proper and sure words of this prophecye
co^cerninge ye abominatio^ of these false speakers / he says yt they take not
away ye doctrine of Christ / Roma. xvj
another deny ye learning of the gospel (if thou yt sider the outward face)
but that they set to it evil occasions and dissentions with the which in
process they everrunne and distroy the hole way and gospel of the lord
reserving it only by name and title. So not we se all these things fulfillid?
since yt the chirch of Rome does abound through all ye world with so many sects
of works and relig^o^s which desever among the^ silf with extreme f^erye and
madness by the which is expelled and put out the right way which bringith men
to faith and charity? What feign they in these sects but high and pure
godliness? Do not we also praise these ways and avance the^ unto heven? Are we
not here taught to stick and put our confidence in our own merits / and
not in the pure faith of Christ? ye in so much ye we have begone to selloure
meretes to other? Is not the faith and gospel transgressid and in manner
destroyed? Therefore these ought not to be vndersido^ of heretics but of
Busshoppes / Shepardes and religiouse with their infinite variete and diversnes
of sects and works / which deceave and destroy them silf and the people /
with a false and clokyd hope / teachinge nothi^ge less then faith all
stycking to their own works. And they (blind them silf) are the leaders of
blind me^ What meanith this yt he does not say they shall deem the lord / but
the lord which has bought (...). With out doubt he prophesies that Christ
shall be denied of them as touching justification / not because they shall
plainly deny him (for then they should not be false doctores / nether prevely
bring in sects of perdition / counterfettinge the doctrine of truth) But
(reservinge the titles and names) will go a boute to be saved by their own
sects / and not by the faith in Christ Jesus / for Christ bought us with his
own blood / that by the faith in him we might be justified. But the infinite
diversite of religions / works / and sects / goo about to persuade us / that
we must satisfy God with our acts / and deserve the kingdom of heven. All
these sects the Pope makyth full of cloked hypocrisy / and very noisome by
his confirmation / while he does stablish them as holy orders / and holsom
rueles to live after / and makith men to put confidence in them. And again that
holy father of his best beloved childer full blessidly is strengthed and
stablisshed in his tyra^nie. Proverb.
And (as Mules do) in course one clawyth the other So though they confess in
words the lord to be Christ yet they deem him in deeds. Of whom they make
unto us a another Moses for he bought us not with shedi^ge his blood / that
only he might teach us to live well But to thentent that he might live and
reign with in us / and that he might be our lord workinge in us all our
works / and this is done by only faith in him. But they which now teach us
the gospel make Christ our master / as a servante which should tarry with our
and teach us good / and not rule with in us and work our good deeds.

But it is well that they shall bring apo^ the^ selves swifte perdition / ii.
Pet. ij. math. xxiiij.
for those days shall be shortenid / or else no flessh should be saved / which
shortly we trust shall be parformed. Many shall follow their pernicyouse
doctrine. And few shall be saved from their perditions / wherefore Christ in
the.xxiiij of Matthew does council that they fly to the montaynes / and
return not again in to their howses. j. Juno. i.
And Paul calls them parelous times for this clokid hypocrisye and famed
holiness. But they object / the statutes and ordinances are good / holy me^
did make them / as Augustine / Benedicte / Barnarde / Francisce / Dominice /
and soch other To this I answer. That is eve^ it that christ and the apostles
mean / that these works should be like to those things which are taught in
the gospel / for that they call counterfettinge of the doctrine / and prevelye
banginge in. By cause they take only of the fathers examples of works / and
leve the faith And so they ru^ne hedli^ge with out any judgment into all those
things which the fathers (sumtyme erringe) have made and ordened (and no
mervell for it is prophesed that if it be possible ye very chose^ shall be
brought in to error) and follow even the utter cloak and face of this error
/ Math. xxiiij.
for a good way / and so are conveied away from the gospel and faith by a
sotle and insensible deccite. And chefly when the authorite of the Pope has
approved and allowed those ways and has confirmed and stablisshed that me^
should put confidence in them / ye and makith them necessary bonds / which the
fathers did another make nor keep but with ye liberty of the sprete / binding
no man pepetually to them / for if they did / with out / doubt they erred
according to man's fragilite.

ij. ^^th i^ij.
By whom the way of truth shall be blasphemed / which is the way of truth? Is
it not that which is contrary to the outward face / cloak / and hypocrisye of
works? Trewly the apostles did never institute and orde^ any sect of religion
/ But tawght to every man the only comen way of Christen faith The way
therefore of trveth is to beleve in Christ. Who are blasphemars? truly they
which deny ye lord. And do not they which through the authorite of the Pope
crake on their leving. Bost their sects / and praise their orders / as holy /
right / and wholesome / take away the praise and glory of ye way of truth /
and apply the same unto their orders? has not his blasphemye so prevayled
that the only clargye / and chefly the religiouse be counted for the christen?
and the other are called openly seculare and wordly / and are counted for comen
Iackes as they were clean out of ye way of health. And he that enterith religion
/ is craked / and belevid to go clean out of the world / finally it is
persuaded comenly / that who so ever will be saved ought to enteare religion Is
not this a plain blaspheminge of the way of truth? Math. xxiiij.
Is not this to teach that Christ is here and there? Is not here the way of
faith despised and left and in his stead taken / the sect and superstition of
works? Is not this the way that teaches us to forsake the faith in Christ
and to cleve and put confidence in our own works? Do not soch hypocrites so
shine and here rule in the world / that the simple christen in the faith are
counted (in comparison to them) but durte and filthe of the street?

But let us go a little farther / if any man would rise and presume to reprehend
these ways chosen of men / or as the apostle callith them in the.ij. to the
Collossyans / chosen holiness / Col. ij.
and would teach that they were the pernicious ways of sclawnder / confirmed of
the Pope and avaunsed of them / to destroy the faith / to evacuate and set at
naught the gospel / to seducie and deceave the souls of the christen. And
that the christen faith is only the way of health / what think you they would
do to him? Should he not be called sexhondenth times hercrike / a thousand
times Antichrist / Satan / Sevill / schismatike / and soch other? yees truly /
there were no name of hate / punyshmentes and blasphemy / enough for this
mischevouse ennimye of the chirch / this folissh hardye despisare of the
fathers / this pestilent deceaver of the people. And yet this is no another but
that Petre does say / by whom the way of truth shall be blasphemed. ^^. Petri.
ij
Wherefore? Psalm. ix
For the way of their vanite is commended / as the.ix. Psalm does say.
Because the weked is praised in the desieres of his soull / and the unjust
reioysinge in him silf has blasphemed the lord. How effectuously does this
chirch of the Pope full fill this prophesye now adays / which also
accomplisshith all things that were written in the prophets / of sotle false /
and lieinge prophets / masters / shepardes / iustitiares / which have infinite
other names. And these should have the cheffe ruell and imperye toward the
end of the world.

ii. Petri. ii
And through covetousnes shall they with fained words make merchandise of you.
This is so evidently done / by bullys / Pardones / Decrees / Prestes / and soch
other / that this place neadith no gloss / what is now a days the office and
administration of the hole clergy / But covetousnes? And yt with
dissimulation. Not only pretendinge a cloak of godliness / but also defiling by
abvsion the holy and pure words of God / for they do all abuse these words /
God / Christ the Sprete / ye Chirch / Righteousness / good works and Merits.
For they do not apply the^ to faith / but to their own actyo^s / so yt ye
people vndersto^dith the^ fare otherwise the ye scripture meanith. It is fained
what so ever they preach / for they preach not faith / if they did preach
faith / their sects should sone decay and vanissh away. In the mean ceasone
they have deceaved the people / and brought them clean out of their minds by
their clokyd illusions / and despoile them of all their goods and possessions.
And live them silf with full stuffed belies / idle / rich / mighty / full of
honor / and very gloriouse. And yet the holy name of god must serve these
monstres / for they must be called holy and religious But let us return to
Daniel / where we shall here moare of this abominable kingdom / for this
shall be sufficient for a prohemye. And truly he does declare us a mervelous
and monstrous kingdom / which utterly can be applied to none of the kingdoms
that ever have been in the world / nor shall be. Bycawse that he prevailith with
soch armure and strength / as has not be hard of / goinge a boute new things.
And trewly all that he does are new and mervelouse.

There shall stond a king mighty in faces.
Herome did translate it / vnshamefacyd but the hebrew does say mighty in
faces. A king shall stond / he meanyth not one parson but a hole kingdom /
another vnderstondith he a short ceason of that kingdom / But a great and
long succession of kings / for Christ says / Math. xxiiij
when ye shall se abomination stonding in the holy place / that is to say /
fixed / stablisshed / and stre^gthyde by many adherentes. And Paul makith the
son of perdition not to goo / but to sytte in the temple of god.

Here is a mervelous power of this mo^struous king / which is mighty not with
horns / another nails / another swerd / nor armure. But with faces / fare
unlike all other kings. Another says he mighty with one face / but with many
faces Wherefore this prophecye can not be applied to the Turk another to any
kingdom which is gotten with strength and armure / for soch are figured by
tethe / horns and nails. Another is it ye kingdom of Christ / which (clean
with outen outward face) co^sistith in ye sprete. And fig^ the with a
spiritual home / which is ye word of god. So that this kingdom shall nether
bespirituall another seculare / another gotten by any soch providence. Wherewith
the^? ^rewly with faces / yt is to say by outward clokinge / apperance / and
po^pe / and to use few words with superstitions / customs and ceremonies
which are showed ovtwardly. In clothinge meats / persons / houses /
behaveours / and soch life. Among all these faces and apparences /
superstition and hpocrisye (which is a cloak of godliness and a face of
religion) is most mighty and acceptable / and therefore it is most noisome / for
ye wordly faces and buetes / whether they be of maids / young me^ / riches /
fre^des / plays / or what so ever they are / do not so draw / take / and hold
me^. But these their ceremones / by cause they cou^terfet godly things and
pretend ovtward tokins / of things everlastinge / they take and deceave the^
yt are most wise / holy and mighty / ye and sometime the very chosen children
of god. There fore it is very plain and evide^t yt this king shall be
Antichrist / yt is to say an adversarye to christ / and his ki^gdome / for
Christ is a ki^ge mighty in truth / an extreme adversarye to faces and clokes
/ as we se in ye gospel. And this king is mighty in faces / an extreme
adversary of ye truth / therefore it is not with out a great cawse yt the
apostles Petre and Paul / do so often remember us of this word / truth / and
fear us from ye faces for so Paul did prophesye in ye second pistle ji.
Timeth. iii
to Timothe expounding this place. ^i. Timoth. iij
Men shall be lovers of their own selves / it folowith havi^ge a similitude of
good livi^ge / but have denied ye power there of. The first face.
Now let us consider the kingdom of the Pope / and first ye face of the
persons / tell me if thou ca^ what impery ever had soch and so many clean decte
and appareld fellows / first look on the Pope him silf so proud and glorious
with his iii. crowns / with his mervelouse pomp and apparel / and noise of
his howsolde / then ye Cardinals with their pomp and riches / which are not
fare be hind ye other / for this most wretched kind of me^ makith him silf
equalle with kings. After them consider / the Patriarchas / Primates.
Archbusshopes / suffragames / Provostes / Deanes / Canones / Vicares /
Officialles / Scribes. And who is able to number that sower sorts and orderes
of the religious. And these are they in whom men boste that the state and
health of the chirch does consiste / here behold the most holy decrees of
our holy father ye Pope and whereof they entreat / do they not all entreat of
this to stablissh their own profit and kingdom? They say them self that they
are so necessary that with out them the church ca^ not be rueled Nevertheless
Christ and his apostles did rule it with the truth and that falwell. Another se
I any profytte yt comes by the^ other to ye chirch or to ye word of god but
rather much hurt Understand you now what is this king mighty with faces?
The^ understand you also. What is the abominatio^ sto^dinge in ye holy place /
Danie. viij Math. xxiiiij.
if so be you compare together their clokinge and hypocrisye with the truth
and godliness of the apostles

And the Hebrew word that signifiyth mighty / does properly mean a natural
strength / and not a violent and outward power by the which we defend our
own goods or persequute other. But even as we speak of the strength and
power of herbs signifiyng his natural might in operation. Even likewise the
natural power of this king is nothing else but a cloak / a face and a vicsar
/ which is multiplied and increased by infinite means / of the which thing
Judas ye apostle did prophesye on this manner They have men in great reverence
be cause of avantage. And James in the.ij. Jude. j.
have not the faith of our lord Jesus Christ in respect of persons. And
again Judas / Jacob. ij
there are certain craftily crepte in of which it was written a fore time unto
soch judgment / Jude. i
they are ungodly and turn ye grace of our lord god unto wantannes / and
deny god the only lord. And our lord Jesus Christ. Nether here will I
improve and forsake saint Hiero^s tra^slatio^ which calls him vnshamefaced /
for there he plainly declarith ye presumption of these hypocrites / for scant
any man can beleve / how sure / bold / and presumptious this face and cloak of
godliness does make them / for they cownt them self / above all men most
worthy heven and (as the prophet says) they set their neste among the
sterres / Psalm. lxxiij.
finally they are come to soch vnshamefacednes that they have compassion of the
other multitude / and (devoueringe their possessions and howsses) communicate
and sell un to them their merits. And some (as the Pharise did to the
Publicane) do crake on them silf revilinge the poor people. Luce xviij.
In this sense semede he to speak which translated the.xxj. Prouer. xxj
of the proverbes on this manner. A weked man does boldly and with out shame
stablissh his countenance / which in the Hebrew is thus. A weked man is mighty
in his face / and a righteous man does direct and order his way. As thowgh he
should say the weked man is sure and pu^teth all his confidence in his outward
face of godliness. But the rightuous man does ever proceed and go forward to
that yt is be for him / as th^ppostle teaches. Philip. iij.
And his securite is well described in the x. Psalm. x.
Psalm where as it is said. The weeked man said in his heart I shall not be
moved from one generation in to an other. I shall be with out evil. And again.
Thy iudgme^tes are taken away from his face / soch a saing has Esaias in
the.xxviij. Esaie xxviij
and speakith it on the wecked that were in his time which had made a bargane
and a greament with death and hell.

Let us now consider certain other faces which stablissh the power of this
kingdom. The second face.
Here present them silf. Thenches of the chirch / the patrimony of Christ and
spiritual goods / for the power of this kingdom does make temporal goods
spiritual / wordly goods the tresures of the chirch. And bodily goods
hevenly / with these is their chirch endewed / garnisshed and glorified / in so
much that the greatist part of their clokes and faces consiste in these / show
me what emperor ever had soch abundance of richese. Every man knowith that
more then half the richesse of the world are possessed of the spiritualte / so
many cytes / castelles / dukedomes / kingdoms and countres are incorporate to
this king. The imperye of Rome did only take a tribute / and custom of his
subjects. But this king chalengith ye hole goods and substans of the^ which
are subdewed under his majesty to be his private / and at his pleasure / which
of the co^soulles that ever reigned in Rome may be compared / to one of these
Cardinals / or archbusshopes? Trewly there is no impery that has so many
punces / so many lords / soch abounda^ce of riches / soch superfluite and soch
glory / how be it they not satisfied not co^te^t with all this (which is as we
have said the half of the christente) presume to claim the seculare riches /
goinge about to despoyle them of their rucles / powers and offices / at their
pleasure / and subdew to them self Countres / provinces / Cytes / Castelles
and towns / by their own authorite / finally to rule in every place where it
plesith the^ / and if any men resist them / they wroppe them to gether in
batelles and other trobles. Other with their own sodyars / or else they stir
princes and officers to distord against them / and will never leve them /
until they have had their plesures.

Another yet is this kingdom of faces content that he has obtained all the
riches of the hole world to be his own but bether he has proceeded that he
has brought to pass to claim all things justly / how often and many times
as he list / for the Pope sucketh ye sweet from the Busshopes. And the
Busshopes search the Curattes purses / pretendi^ge infinite titles to rob
them / as institution and induction / the first fruetes / sinage / and proxsy
with soch other. This can not they pay except they dispoyle the people / and
by cause their theft shall not be openly known / they cloak it under gods
law. And say they must pay open tithes and prevey tithes / and sell them the
sacraments. And by cawse their falshod should not come to light / they keep
them from lokinge on the scripture. So the Curattes and the religious do swalow
vpe the people that they mayfill the Busshopes and their selves. And this
crafty theft does the Pope exercise by the which he has stolen half the
goods that are in the church / the other part has he ravisshed with Pardons
/ Bulls / Confessionalles / Privileges / Dispensations / and who is able to
number ye titles that he has craftelye invented to delude and blind the people
/ that he might the more freely / dispoylle them. And all these things do these
faces work ye and be increased continuallye / yt they may so work from day
to day. These are the holy / meake / and faithful offices of Curattes and
heedes of the chirch / with the which they shine as the lights of the world be
is holden a cursed which says not that these are good and well done / and
sufferethe them not to engrosse all things for to increase / garnisshe / and
strength their holy chirch / trewly these pass the superfluites of the Perses,
The riches of ye Romans are nothing / if thou consider these golden sees and
floudes of silver. And I pray the what profit comes on the^? Wherefore serve
they? Are they distribueted among the poor and nedye? Nay treuly / but rather
in to the vices of zodom and Gomorrha / and soch other abominable offenses /
how be it why bring I in soch light examples? for the thing itself passithe
all beleve / all sense / and all words.

And yet to stablissh and strength this kingdom of faces these help much.
Insomoch that it is a lighter offense to kille / to do advoutry / and to stelle
/ tut what for these trifulles? I say it is lighter to blaspheme the name of
god / to be perjured / to have denied ye faith / all though these are counted
but games to the^) then (through the entiseme^t of yt devil) to have hurt a
clerk / or to have diminisshed his goods to ye value of one / halfpeny / so
holy are their abominable theftes it is openly spoken with a terrible an
ferfull noise that many have suddenly perisshed and chefly princes / and that
no man escapith with out sclawnder / which has other touched any of their
possessions / or else has not honored them accordingly. They understand not
that these are works of error in the signs and false miracles of satan /
since that therefore evil chawnseth to them that touch these / not that they
are holy / but rather by cause they are so cursed and venemouse which are gotten
by soch myschevous crafts and horrible theftes / that it is very noisome / ye
death to a goodma^ to touch the^ / all tough they be prosperouse and great
solas / to the^ that stele them / to them which consent to the theft / to
them which support this robbers / and to them that are partakers of this
pillage / for they fare well / and live voluptuously. They are full gloricus.
And after their death / they are bueryed with all solemnite and pomp / with
graven signs and images / founding perpetual memorials to obtain heven with
all which they hade no leisure to geate will they were a live / for the in
great besines in these their holy matters / and so in the mean ceason against
their will are compelled to go to hell.

After these glories and honors of ye church / The third face.
that is to say the faces which are prepared full religiously for the praise of
god there folowith an other face which is of houses / palaces / and soch
bildinge / for as the face of riches does garnisshe the faces of the persons /
with out which ye persons should seem but vile. Even so the face of bildinge
does setfurthe the riches / for the riches are cownted of no reputation /
except according to them their places befaire / clean / and glorious. Tell me
here also if you can What nation is so proud so glorious / so high minded /
and so prodigal in bildinge / or who has so many habitations / as this
kingdom of faces? Is not the most fruerfull ground theirs? Are not the best
places / the strongest holds / and most pleasante dwellinge houses in their
hands? What delicates or daintes / what shininge and clenlines in all the
world may be compared to theirs? They bild / as thowgh they went about to
prepare a perpetual paradise for them selves in this world. Consider the
palaces of the most reverend Cardinals which they possess for the glory of
god / and honor of the church. And thou shall be a shamed to compare the
palaces of kings un to them. And it is no mervell for they be the successors
of the Apostles and the true chirch of god / and therefore they must be equal
with kings / ye their superiors for the Apostles were fischers But let us
pass these things / and touch other that are not so holy / for these three /
apparellinge / riches / and palaces / are counted most holy things / for what
a mvltitude of laws be there concerning dignites / preferme^tes / prebendes /
iugme^tes / courts / privileges and soch other / which as well agree with the
chirch / as Christ does with belial. ij. Corin. vi


The fourth face.
The fourth of these faces / is their vesture clothing and garments. By the
which this weked abomination does chefly of all defend him silfe / for who is
he / that this read cape this.ij. horned myter / and purpull hatte / do not
make proud / holy / and worshupfull? how say you to their mules trapped i^
gold / their gowns set and adorned with ge^mes / and all precious things?
And their variete in all points with which they have separate the^ self from
the seculare and comen clothing of the christian as from a profane and unclean
thing? And it is the greateste offense that can be to touch their shaven hedde
/ and their hands which are consecrated with that blissed oil / of their own
halowi^ge / happy is he that is found worthy to be admitted to kise them. And
as for the habites of the religiouse thowgh they do stablissh this face greatly
/ yet they them self do in a manner abhor them. Here may thou se / if one
offend in these habittes and vesturs what great sins spring of it / what
scrupulosyte of conscience / and what cases reserved. What fornication thinkist
thou may be compared to this transgression / if one of their shavelinges go not
to the barbar / in a hole month? what murder / if he minister at ye altar /
with out a stole / with out a phannen / or want any piece of the garment
depueted to his office? O this is a worthy religion / and a mete honor / to
soch sanctes. Here laws / statutes manners and customs / dispensations /
irregularites / and soch other abominatio^s (which would cawse a man to cast his
gorge in remembering them) have their full ruell and impery / here in /
consists the godliness of the christen. These be the holy and pure chirch of
god. Among them the sprite continues we must beleve that these can not err /
and for no another cawse but that they are shave^ / and so clothed / and carried
about on mules and charettes / all thowgh thy be never so weked never so
ignorant in scripture / ye thowgh they lack their comen senses / and be moare
rude the^ asses of archadie. This face does so bolden them that they dare
presume to do all things.

Ye se how the successors of thappostles / and the vicars of god in the earth /
take their cross upon them / and follow Christ.

The.v. face
The fifte. This is a goodly craft to lose and consume money / in bilding /
settinge up garnishing / and making rich Monasteryes / Chapelles / Temples /
Altares and soch other works / for here the most holy laws of ye Pope /
Bulls / and seals (not one way) grant heven to them that put to their
helpinge hands / and to the foundars / here are ye taught to trust in your
works. Here are in numerable tresures gadered to gether for ye house of god /
here the greater / the more gorgeous / the richer / and better garnisshed
houses they bild / the more christ they are. And they do better (as they say)
which geve their alms to that / the^ they which distribute it to the poor and
nedy. Another bild they that it may be a mete place to here ye word of god. But
that they may be seen of god and men. They bild a house for god which since that
ons he did deny by sanct Stepha^ in the.vij. of the Acts / Acts. vij. (...)
^e. ^i^i
and long before him by Natan and David to dwell in temples made with man's
hand / yet now (like an outlawe) he beggeth of us houses for him silf and his
sanctes. And our most holy father the Pope with his Busshoppes does not only
confirm the vain and folish minds of the people with his halowinges /
blissinges / fredoms and protections. j. Timot. iiij.
But also pursues / and condemned / with curses and imprecations with
threatninges / and great sentences them that violate / despise / and abuse
these pha^tasyes / as it well decu^meth the godliness of these faces. Thus he
moves and entiseth men to it. Out of this springs not a small part of his
most holy law which vexes the world with folish and scrupulous co^scie^ces
marked with an hort yero^ In the mean ceason what is done concerning the word
of god and ye faith? Let god take heed to that in his kingdom of truth As for
this king must se his kingdom of faces well ordered / and see it a loft with
all ye crafts and strength he may. Tell me what is worshuppi^ge of wodde and
stones if this be not it? truly god commanded not these superstitious
ceremonies / but rather these things that he commavnded by these are
transgressed and destroyed. The.vj. face
The sext is not one face but a hole foreste of faces / touching all ye holy
works that are done in the temples for lukere / and ava^tage. Here are mate^s
/ prime / and hours / rored out and mumbeled up with great labor / so that
they are never prayed. How be it they are increased daily with other hours of
the blessed virgin and of the holy cross / and with the noise of those verses
which god in ye prophet said he would not hear. Amos. v
There is no end / and who ca^ rehearse with how many laws (that is to say
authors of sin) and scrupulosite of conscience this one work vexes and is
vexed? There are added voices and songs of infinite kind and variete. For ye
organes and all i^strume^tes of music serve for this face. I will not speak of
chaleses images / and vessels that they use of gold silver wodde / then /
vailes / copes and vestimentes and soch other orname^tes with out mesure and
number. Lights / lamps / and soch like. The sacraments are increased.
And to be short here have they increased the sacraments / Confirmation /
Orders / Matrimonye / and Anelinge / good lord / what a whorlepole have they
made to devour money / and me^nes souls / who can bear in memory the laws
which are made that these things may be exequuted religiously? And these
things think they so expediente and needful to the Christen / that they will
sooner forgeve advoutrye then one of the offenses which is committed against the least of their holy laws and faces. If our most holy father hade left these
and all ye other faces fre and accordi^ge to ye gospel had left us all equal
/ we should have had none of these i^numerable sins / for where is ^o law
there is no tra^sgression But now he (abvsinge our scrupulous consciences)
has ordened and made infinite laws / and through them infinite sins and
condemnations / and this is the cawse that Paul calls him the man of sin /
ij. Tess. ij.
and son of perdition / that is to say a wilful maker of laws / and most
ungodly in things that were made fre by Christ to all faithful. Here shall I
be condemned of the sodiars and company of this holy father and shall be called
a fautor of Walde^ and Wiglefe / how be it Daniel conforteth me which says in
the.xj. against Antichrist on this manner / Dani. xi
he shall worship in his bildinge the God of Maozim / and the god whom his
fathers did not know shall he honor with gold silver / precious stones and
other glorious riches. And he shall labor to stablish Maozim with the strange
god whom he knowith not / and he shall increase glory / and geve the^ power on
many things / and shall divied the earth freely. It is sufficient for me to know
that all these things are fre and not necessary for my health / and therefore
that they are another necessary precepts another yet profitable / but only so
fained by most cruel wekednes and tyra^nie of Antichrist to the^tent that
sins and co^de^nations might be multiplied / they are but faces and not ye
very body:

The seventhe face may be called the hole abuse of the mass with his
sole^nites / The.vii. face The abuse of the mass.
with vigilles / with year minds / foundatio^s / bu^rialles / and the hole
besines that is done for the dead / for what is in it but a face and cloak of
godli^esse which deceaveth ye people and swaloweth up their money? we have now
adays no mass for thentent to be partakers of the altar and to hear the
gospel / and yet this is the cheffe cause of the mass / but we use the^ as
good works rather for them that are departede then for the qwicke / reserved
that qwicke prestes get them a substa^ciall levinge by this office / finally
we use it as thowgh it pertayned no thing to communion. They keep the
sacrament / after mass to ministre to the seake / and bear it a boute in
mynion pixes as thowgh it were a thing to wonder at. All these are the
inve^tio^s of man and were never commanded of god / another are they necessary
/ but rather weked and forbed / chefly those that pertayne to the mass But
this most holy fontayne of sin / and perdition causes them to be necessary.
In so much that he shall be counted an heretic that will once qwinche against it.

The viij. face Fastes
The.viij. face / is the choice of meat and fasting which are indifferent for
each day. But now a days men fast on ye manner not that ye flesch should be
mortified / but bicawse it is a good work to have fasted this day / and to
have abstayned from meat this day / and that day / so that they may deserve
heven what thing is this but a weked face? Thimoth. iii.
of whom Paul prophesied in the.iiij. of the first pistell to Timoth.
commanding to abstain from meats / which god has created. Gala. iiij
And in the.iiij to the Galathya^s / ye observe ye days / and mo^thes / and
times / and years. I fear of you lest I have bestowed on you labor in vain

The.ix. The. ix face
face I count this mischevous multiplication and encreasinge of these weked
holy days / Holy days
for now a days our most holy father teachith men through idelnes to serve god
/ yt is to say as he expounds it him self By intermission and ceasing from
all bodly works. And yet all days of god are ordened fre both to labor and
cease from labor indifferently. Among these / festes / some are principale /
some duble and so forth / as ye fest of corpus Christi / of ye Visitatio^ /
and Co^ceptio^ / of our lady and of ye apostles / and soch other / if any
presume to break these / or else keep the^ with a grutchi^ge heart (thowgh they
be in dead but folish / unprofitable / and vain precepts) they will geve
sentes and affirm boldly / yt they sin grevously / and bri^ge their souls
in to utter destruction.

The tenth is the excellent ( The.x. face ^lowinge o^ chast^es
al thowgh it be fained) kepinge of virginite and chastity of ye religions /
which trewly seems in ye face a godly and heve^ly thing. But it is a develish
of ye which it is spoken in ye.iiij. of the first pistell to Timothe.
forbiddinge to marye ij. Timot. iii
where as again our most reuernde father / makes that thing necessary that
Christ would have fre / whereof Daniel in the.xi. speaks he shall be desirous of
women. ^anie. xj
Here Daniel meanith that he shall refuse and abstain from marriage for a cloak
of godliness / and not for love of chastity.

The xi. face.
The.xj. is the worshuppinge of relickes / trewly this is a proper and most
fruerfull cloak of avantage. Relickes
Out of this were indented innumerable pilgrimages / Pilgrimages
with the which the folissh and unlearned people might lose their labor / money
/ and time / nothing in the mean ceason regardinge their house / wiff / and
children / contrary to the commaundme^t of god / or else might do much better
deeds to their neighbueres / which is ye precepte. As for the worshuppinge or
visitinge of relickes is nothing but even the very mind and affection of me^.
They would make sanct Hierome / the beginner and author of this thing / which
writing to vigilantius ente^ded nothing but that men should not rebuke and
despise relickes. How be it they do so fare abyse his authorite / that they
will have no mesure in worshuppinge them / they will have no work prefared
above this. They will have none compared un to it. And it has so prevailed /
owe^.
that it is come to vows which can not be dispensed with not of ye Pope him
silf (except thou have a bag of money) But what a folissh vow is it that is
thus made against the precepte of god. This painted and be wtifull face does so
fare deceave men that it is not cownted an offense to leve the charge of his
wiffe and children / but rather a great merit. O what a blindness is this. In
this face I may number the sects of brotherheddes which were invented by the
singular provision of satan to destroy the noble and cheffe brotherhed of
faith and cherite / Brotherheddes.
for these also are confirmed and stablisshed / under the names of sanctes /
and in ye reverence and worshupe of relickes. Of their ab^se it is spoken in a
another place / and need it were to make a hole book upon this monster. The.xii.
face


The.xij. and last (for I will leve the residew to other men's coniecturinge)
is the very confused cloud and opened gate of hell / which has a mervelous
and pleasant face to look apo^. These be the vniversites in the which perjury
and the abose of the name of god are the enteringe in / Vniversitee.
and afterward their conversation is most fre and at liberty unto every
mischeffe / yet under these sins and perditions / there is promised science
and wisdom / with titles and degrees prescribed unto them instead of a
reward. And what perform they at the length? First the most cleneste and
quick witted young me^ of the christente here are defiled and defloured / and
cast in to the wide throat of hell / so that I judge yt this perdition was
figured by ye idolle Moloch / to whom men were wont to do sacrifice with their
deariste and best beloved sons and daughters. After yt the most christian
wits are occupied / ye blinded and oppressed with Aristotle and other
gentiles and me^nes learning. Aristotle.
And for the word of god / the traditions of the Pope are taught and handeled.
In so much that utterly to subverte and put down the gospel Satan cowld
never have found a more sotle and craftye invention / another yet of more power
and value / then to bild up vniversites / where as under the title of
christian learning is nothing taught but that which is most repugnante and
against the christen faith / whereof we would speak very many things if time
and leysuer favored us* And out of these caves and dens are they called to
be governers and curattes of chirches / when they seem to chouse the best. And
treuly unto me this last face and cloak does appear most noisome of all / for
this only has ye title and name of the word (and all the other have only the
title of example) and plainly is the scole of hid of yt is to say of suttell
disputations / of the which we will speak anon. And the most hurt and
damnage consistithe under the title of the word / and for to teach other
things in his stead and name / for since ye face of example is formed and
stablisshed apo^ ye face of ye word it would sone decay if ye true word did
purely reign. Besides yt the face of examples does only deceave ye manners /
but the cloak and face of ye word does overturne and destroy the faith. And if
ye through the grace and provitio^ of god / the vniversites should receave his
word / good lord / how sone should the Popes imperye with all his faces decay
and perissh / for this one cloak and face is the very up holder / Bones / and
hole power / of all this kingdonme of faces.

This visare and cloked face as I think was prophesed in the.ix. Aocalip. ix
of the Apocalipses whose words are worthy to be rehearsed / and some deall to
be interpreted / for he says. And the first angel blewe / and I saw a
star fall from heve^ un to the earth / and to him was geve^ the kaye of the
botto^lesse pytte here will I sumwhate take mine own mind and exposition. It
is evident that angels through all the apocalipses do signifye ye busshopes of
the chirches as it apereth by the second and.iij. chapter / where it is written
to tha^gell of Ephesus / and to the angel of Smirna / and to soch other.
Apoca. ij
Now ye other kind of angels that blow the trompettes / which (as it is
showed in ye. viij. has seve^ heddes can be applied to none but to the Pope of
Rome for it is not written that any other do blow trompettes / Apoca. viij
for to blow a trompett (as the agreinge of the place / and the textes
folowinge do specify) can be nothing else. But to make decrees / which thing
no man has taken upon him at any time / but the Pope of Rome / Another is it
written with out a great cause that they prepared them selves to blow for these
only Popes have ever hade an impatient furye / and vnquiett tyranny / to make
laws and subdew other under them. But let us return unto our fyfte Angel
which is the first of the three that should bring in.iij. wooes / apo^ the earth
this is he which first did ordene and stablissh vniversites whom it is not easy
for me to name / the stories do so differ and dissent. But who so ever he was
let him be the star that fell from heven to the earth / whether he were
Alexander of hales / or else (which I sooner beleve) sanct Thomas / Saint Thomas
de aquino.
which after the vniversites approved and the trompett of this Angel other was
the first / or else ye greatist author to bring in philosophye among the
christian / being a subtyle and very craftye disputer (ye very Aristotel him
silf) into whom as in to the earth he fell from Christ in heven / grounding him
silf upon the authorite of the most ungodly and weked Angel which did approve
soch manner of study / he took the kaye of the bottomless pit / and opened
it / and brought out unto us philosophye which a Collo. ii.
little before was dead and comdemned by the apostles / and from thense did
assend the smoke of this pit that is to say very words and opinions of
Aristotle and other philosophers as it hade been the smoke of a great furnace
/ Apocalx^
for philosophy so did prevail that he made Aristotle equale with Christ as
concerning authorite and faith / where with was darkened the bright son (of
righteousness and truth Christ / for in the stead of the faith were brought in
moral virtues / and for the truth infinite opinions) and the air / by the
reason of ye smoke of this pit / that you might understand / that it was not
an eclipse of the sone / but a darkness both of the son and of the air
through the smoke that ascended from beneth / that is to say through men's
traditions and learning / Christ and his faith (which are the air and sprete)
be oppressed and darkened. And there came out of the smoke locustes upon the
earth. Locustes.
This is the people of the vniversite which is rootide and brought vpe in
philosophye and are called with a propre name locustes / By cause they follow
the Angel of the bottomless pit / which is ye Pope clean forsakinge their
king (Christ) and fly on swarms / as it is said in the.iij. of the
Proverbes. Prouer. iij
And then they despoile / and burn vpe all that is grene / in that part where
they sit so that the gramarians suppose that they are called locustes a loco
vsto which signifies a burned and wethered place. So this people burns and
consumes the hole grene spring of Christ / yt is to say / the fructe of
faith, And to them is geven power / as the scorpions of the earth have power /
that is to say to wond the conscience / for after that the grene and
florisshinge fruit of faith which heals the co^co^science is whethered and
destroyed / the conscience cannot but be hurt And it was said unto them yt
they should not hurt the grass of the earth another all the grene nether all the
trees / that is to say the chosen / for they shall not hurt all men. Another
natural locustes do hurt all grene / The seall of god.
but some certain place / like wisse here / but only (he says) those men
which have not the seal in their forheddes / that is some grass / and the^
which have not faith which is the seal of God that we bear in a pure
conscience and fre conversation.

And to the^ was commavnded that they should not kille them / Moral philosophye
but that they should be vexed.v. months. And this as I suppose was spoken of
moral philosophy / which sith it does not teach the true knowledge of sin it
does not kille as the law of God does / but only with vain affections does
vex and prike them. ij. Timo. iij
Ever learning and never attayninge the knowledge of truth / for they that are
killed with the law are quickened again with the everlastinge sprete / and
are not vexed.v. months / that is to say through all the time of their sensual
lyffe / in the which moral virtues rule. And we se all moral divines to have
a parelous and weked conscience / full of scrupulosite / and never quiet which
another ca^ attain good nor evil. Therefore it follows / and their pain was
as the pain yt comes of a scorpione when he has stonge a man / be hold the
prikinge of the conscience / he expounds that / which he spoke of. That they
are not holsomly killed / nether quickened spiritually. And in these days shall
men seake death and shall not find it / they shall desire to deye and death
shall fly from them / that is the death of sin which reigns and is over
quick / stikinge in the conscience / and yet is it not known to the point as
it ought to be / for if it were well known it should sone perissh and deye.
But this is not the office of the Etikes of Aristotle / but of the law and
sprete.

And the similitude of the locustes was like unto horses prepared unto batell /
Batell*
that is of sotle disputations and brawlinge scole matters / which in an
allegory are called batell for they are ready to dispute on this side and that
/ with it and against it. And on their heddes were as it were crowns / like
unto gold / they be / names and titles of degrees. Our noble master / humble
and unworthy professor of divinite and so furthe. And their faces were as they
had been the faces of me^ / Faces
for their doctrine and liffe was not governed with the sprete of faith / but
with the rightinge and information of their ^^^e natural reason. Aristotle the
light of nature lighteninge them. And thy had hears as the hears of women.
Philosophy brings forth weke and effeminate prestes / Heare^
which are all geven to pleasurs and superfluites / in whom reigns nether
sprete nor manlye wisdom in Christ / for hears do signifye prestes as in
the.lxvij. Psalm / and in the iij. of Esai / and other places. Psalm. lxvij
Esai^ iij
Nether is it lawful to be a divine except he be soch a priest first. In so
much that devines are comenly evil spoken of among the come^ people. And their
teth were / as the teth of lions. Tethe
Consider duns men among all other devines whethere they be not bytars.
Checkers / sclawnderers and devourars / of all these that speak against
Aristotle's divinite how be hit it is no mervell / for the duns men / and sanct
Thomas me^ which are now adays would them self devour each other / and sharpen
their teth as ferse as lions. Nether is there any kind of men which would fight
moare cruelly and with moare hate / then these sects of devines. In so much
that every one of them desiringe the others destruction would feign reign alone.

And they hade harbergions as it were harbergions of yeron. Harbergio^s.
This is the pertinecyte / stiffnes / and sure presumption of every sect
concerning the stabilite / and truth / of their own opinions / with these
their yeron brestplates they can not be overcome. And these are the principles
in every sect. And the sound of their wings was as the soundes of charectes
when many horses rune to gether to batell. Wings
The wings be the words of these brawlinge disputars with the which they
fight and run at each other / violently / checkinglye / and with great noise.
As we se in the contentious brawlinge of these disputars both in words and
writing / where as none will geve place to the other / but remain invincible
stickinge still to his opinion be it right or wrong. This stubburne mind and
affection in disputations is signified by the runninge to gedder of charactes
and horses. Tails
And they had tails like un to scrorpions and there where stinges in their
tails. And their power was to hurt men.v. months. He expounds that which
he spoke of before / shewinge that the fructhe / end / and effect of this
divinite is nothing else but to vex evil consciences through all their
sensual liffe. But to them that are spiritual this divinite is abomination /
for they are separate from these.v. months / in the sprete of liberty.

King
And they had a king over them which is thangell of the bottomless pit whose
name in the hebrew tongue is Abadon / but in the greek tongue Apollyon. Here let
us consider the most general rulare of act vniversites. Not Christ / not the
holy ghost / not the angel of the lord / but thangell of the bottomless
pit / and of them that are dead and damned / whom means he then? Truly the
light of nature Aristotle (which well may be called Apollion that is to say a
destroyer and corruptoure of the church) reigns in the vniversites. Another
was he worthy in scripture to be named by his own name, we said that this
angel did signifye a doctor and teacher in the chirch. And it is evident that
Aristotle dead and damned / is now a days the instructore of all vniversites /
moare then Christ / for Aristotle commended by the authorite and diligence of
sanct Thomas is set a loffte and reigns Raisinge again and stablisshinge
fre will / teachinge moral virtues / and natural philosophye / and may be
called three hedded Cerberus / or rather Geryon with three bodies. Cerberus


Behold the first woo that the chirch has received of the Pope of Rome through
the help and means of sanct Thomas. It had been their duetes most of all to
have forbed and suppressed these things / and they chefly have brought it up
and stablisshed it. Tell me christen reader. Are not these faces and clokes
counted the hedde tail / and all to gedder? Are not these the ground and
substance of the Canon law? Canon law
What do the weked canonistes learn. But the observation and fulfillinge of
these clokes and faces / invented and ordened by ungodly men which partaineth
nothing to god or ye chirch? Tell me if thou find one good work in them that
God commanded. Read over the hole Canon law / and show me one place where the
Pope or any Busshope is moved to the office of the Gospel. All is decreed of
jurisdictions / and nothing of the word of God / all thowgh there be need of
no other thing in the church but of his word. But that is left to
chappellayns and hegge prestes / and to them that are most rude and unlearned.
O woe be to the thou Pope: woe be to you Cardinals: woe be to you Busshopes: woe
be to you prestes woe be to you relligious persons / and to all the orders of
Satan's Sinagoge / who shall teach you to fly from the vengeance which shall
come and is now at hand? Math^ iii.
What shall you answer / for the office of the word which you have taken upon
you / and have not fulfilled it? Think you that he will accept yower.iij.
crowns / hattes / myters / ringes / gold / purpull / and all yower clokes and
faces? This sentence is sure and stable he looks not upon the face of men.
Wherefore he that can / let him hear the counsel of christ where he teaches
in ye.xxiiij. Math. xxjiij.
of Matthew to fly un to ye montaynes and not return again in to our houses.
Let him forsake the world that may / let him go in to ye wilderness yt is fre.
Desire not / desire not man who so ever thou art / to have a B^sshoprike / a
Canonrye / an Abbottes coulle or any orders of presthode / for there is sin
and perdition in them all / as the forsaid faces do show the. Or else if thou
have a great mind or be compelled to take orders / Orders.
then despise these faces of Antichrist / and do thy diligence purely to serve
the gospel / other by thy self teachinge it / if thou have that gift / or else
assistinge / helpinge / and servinge them which have the grace to teach / as
the Apostles did testifye them selves yt they had many By sides this desire god
hartelye with pure prayer for then crease of the gospel. Beleve me / except
thou do thus / thou takist thi^ orders to thy da^natio^ / ye thowgh thou do
miracles / and commit thy silf to the fire to be burned. There is but one
specialle office yt pertayneth to thine orders / and that is to preach ye word
of god / if thou do not this / thou art not anointed inwardly with ye holy
ghost / but only vtwardly for a cloak. But lord / how has this most holy ki^ge
prevailed that he has clean suppressed ye gospel? And why shall I not curse
this cursed abominatio^-The lord Jesus Christ destroy these idolles of the
world / yower Popedoms and Cardinalshuppes / with all yower clokes and faces /
in to ye depth of hell for ever Amen. Now I think thou vnderstondist what it
means yt this king is mighty in faces. It follows.

And understanding rydles.
Soch a king / soch a law. Danie. viij.
Soch a law / soch people. Soch people / soch manners / soch manners soche
studies and affections. Sillogismus
But ye king is a very cloak / face / and idolle Therefore his law must needs
be a stark lie and fa^tasye / as Petre did prophesye. ij. Petri. ij.
There shall be false teachers among you / which through covetuousnes with fained
words shall make marcha^dise of you. ij. Timoth. iij
And in the fourth of the first pistell to Timothe. which speak false through
hypocrisye. And how can he teach the truth which is nothing him self but a
cloak and lie / for he that is endewed with that opinion that he will count
these f^ces substantial things in erneste / he will not only speak lies /
but he shall not be able to sustain nor abide the truth: Is not this a
notable / ye an abominable lie to teach ceremonies for the faith of Christ /
for the sprete / to orde^ traditions and learninges of men? Does not the Pope
with his laws avaunce and bost him silf yt he governs and fedeth the chirch
of god? does he not commend as good deades those things which are done by
fulfillinge his law? does he not persequute and condemn those yt obey not him
al thowgh they observe and keep all the hole gospel? O this weked and cursed
abomination. Here is the sainge of Paul fulfilled / which is an aduersarye and
is exalted above all that is called god / ij. Thessa. ij.
or that is worshupped / so that he shall sit in the temple of god and show him
silf as god. Does not he sit in the temple of god which says and professes
him self to be the master in the hole chirch? what is the temple of god? Is it
stones and wodde? does not Paul say The temple of God is holy which temple are
ye? j. Corint. iij. ij. Co. in. vj.
Nether in the time of paul was there any house which was called the temple of
god as we now call the^ What means this sittinge / but raigninge teachinge /
and iudginge? Who since the beginni^ge of the church / durst presume to call
him self the master of the hole chirch But only the Pope? None of the holy men
/ none of the heretics / durst ever let escape them soch an horrible voice of
pride. Paul bosted him self to be the master of the gentiles in faith and
truth but not the master of the chirch / does he not avaunce him self as he
were god while that for the words of Christ he teaches his own / and for the
righteousness of the faith he stablissheth his own righteousness? May he
naturally be exalted above god? ij. Thessa. ij.
Nay truly / but above all that is called god says the apostle / that is to
say above the word of god preached / for he is called god when he is preached
and beleved in how be it above this god the Pope a great while has been
exalted and sits still / for in the faithful hearts in ye stead of
preachinge and belevinge god / he preaches him silf and his own constitutio^s
/ and so is preferred (as ye greek word does signify which the Apostle
reherseth) both above the honor and worshupe of god / and also above god which
is worshupped. As thowgh he should say in ye heart of man he shall be preferred
above god / yt is to say / his word shall more be feared then the word of god
/ and they shall more obey him and more worshup him / the^ very god him silfe
Does this agree with any man but with the Pope? In every place the word and
precept of God is despised / But every man fears the word of ye Pope. Trewlye
there is no god nether in heven nor earth whose word is reccaved with soch
obedience as is the Popes word which thing experience does so clerly show and
derlare unto us / that he which lacks half his wit can not deny it.

Forthermore who did ever say that he came in ye name of Christ / but only ye
Pope / for he only and the first of all men does boste him silf with
intolerable blasphemye / The pope is the vicare of (...) on earth
and pride to be the vicare of Christ and the vicare of god in the earth. What
signifies the vicare of god. But to sit in gods stead? what is it to sit
in gods stead. But to show him silf as thowgh hewere god? Dowtest thou yet
whether the prophesye of Paul be fulfilled since these two are so like to be the
vicar / of god / and to show him silf as thowgh he were god? Therefore Christ
did well prophesy / yt these Apostles of Antichrist should come in his name /
for the other heretics all thowgh they did cou^terfet and dissemble the truth
/ yet they never pretendid to do it under the name of Christ / but that was
only reserved to Antichrist. Wherefore Christ in the xxiiij. of Matthew not
content to have prophesied that they should come in his name / did add and
expownd him silf. Sainge that I am Christ / as thowgh he should say / They shall
take mine own name upon them / Math xxiiij
which is Christ. And say that they be Christ. And that they have obtained /
for of ye Pope and Christ with their chatteringe they have made one / sainge
that they are so annexed and co^ioyned to gedder / yt Christ ca^ not be
separate from ye Pope nether ye Pope from him. O what a furyous and malicious
blasphemye is this? A weked and wretched bawd / vsurare / theffe and cruel
tyra^ne / is mingled and joined with the lord Christ / and is made one with
him. Come lord Jesus Christ and perscribe some order / or else finishe and make
an end of this horrible and blasphemous abomination.

Yet I pray you what does this vicare of god settinge in ye stead of god? Does
he fulfill and teach the co^mavndmentes of his prince? Nay trewly / what does
he the^? Only teach his own constitutions / and yet does the^ not him self.
How be it if he did teach ye co^ma^ndmentes of god / yet should not he be ye
vicare of god / for a vicare is there as ye prince and hedde is absent.
Therefore / where / as his vicare reigns / there is no god / for where god is
present / there neadeth no vicare / but only ministers / as thapostles called
not the^self ye vicars of god / but only his ministres. Therefore is ye sainge
of Paul fulfilled. When se the man of sin and son of perdition / sittinge
in the temple of god / ij. Thessa ij
shewinge him silf as thowgh he were god / being an adversary / and exalted
above the word of god and all his worshupe. What is more contrary to the truth
of the gospel the^ these faces and clokes and their doctrine? how be it / it
is worshupped / feared and observed above all ye word of god / and that under
the name of him and his learning / but let us retvrne unto daniel (...)

Danie. viij.
This word hidoth which Daniel does put in the hebrew tongue does signifye a
problem a ryed all / and a dark se^te^ce / which deceaveth ye sense if a man
look but on the words. So in ye first of Iudicu^. judicum. j.
I will propound un to you a ryedell. (...). xlviij.
And in ye.xlviij. psalm I will open in a song my dark sentence. Therefore he
is called wittye in these sotle reasons and rydels / which ca^ with dark
words / deceave ye hearers / so yt they may hear one thing and understood a
another. And it is not thus taken yt he should be wittye in ryedles for to
understood that that other men shall speak / but that he is apt and mete to
deceave other by his own words. I will put an example. When this ki^ge of
faces / The Church
in his decrees does use this word the chirch for him silf and his adhere^res
(be they never so ungodly and weked) and goth about to persuade all men yt
what so ever they co^stitute and ordene / it is done of the chirch (as they
have now prevailed / ye and triumph by the obtaining of this word) thikest
thou that he has not propounded a proper rydle / sith that ye chirch does not
signifye / but the holy congregation of faithful which live and are led with
the sprete of god / which are the body and fulfillinge of Christ / as Paul
says. Colo. i^
What lies shall not this man ground and set forth What obedience shall not he
obtain? what law shall not he stablisshe when he has so fare prevailed that
both the hearers and he that speaks do understand the Synagoge of Satan for
the chirch of god? Wh^^ to he that would not obey the church of god? we may
perceave by this word that this ki^gdome of faces differith from the manera^d
condition of all other kingdoms by cawse he contendith not with armure / but
with words. Not with plain and simple words as the kingdom of Christ and
the impery of this world is used and ministered / for the impery of this world
in man's laws determe of temporal things with evide^te words / which of
every man sone are understand. And the kingdom of Christ is rueled by the sure
and plain word of the gospel But this kingdom does undermine me^ and deceave
the^ with dark and duble words which sound one thing and mean an other.
Nether does he teach (that a man may perceave) other wordly things or
spiritual / but he faineth to teach spiritual / and in very deed they are
wordly and te^porall And in this craft they are so wittye / sotle / and apt
(through sathanes help) that they seduce and being in to error (as Christ
prophesied) ye very chosen nether ca^ they be judged but of them which are
spiritual. Danie. viij.
Therefore Daniel calls him sotle and wittye / and his laws ryedles / by
cause he should deceave all men / which sharply and with great diligence do not
mark and take heed of them. Make a proffe thy silf. If thou be taught to
abstain from / me ates / ^^thinges / places / persons / and certain ^ther
things / and to use soch or soch garments / behaveoure / meat / place and
persons Being in this opinion / that by those means and labors / thou shall
do good works and obtain righteousness / And after (when thou come to thy
self and haste the true understanding) doste perceave that thou have labored
but in temporal things which make no more for righteousness / then other
occupations and labors of lay men / would thou not say that thou had
been properly begyled? And had thou not in very deed been deceaved through
fair words? And I pray the are not all that the Pope commands even soch
phantases? Does he not in his decrees and statutes entreat / and de term of
places / meats / vesture / or persons? Where in consists no more iustes then
if thou should go plowe a field / or weve / or spinne. But who plays the
husbond man thinkinge to be justified if he do his work / or to sin if he do
it not / all though it be a profitable and necessary work? And thou art
commanded to labor in that work which is another necessary to the liffe nor
yet profitable for any thing (hopinge to find righteousness in it / and to
sin if thou tra^sgres) for what does it profit other thy liffe or substance
to were a black or a russer cot^ to cate milk or flesh / to be shave^ or
^nshaven / to live in this place or in that? A^ ye^ in this trifelinge and
unprofitable thinge^ thou art commanded to be justified and hallowed / or else
to sin and offend. Are not here problemes / and ryedles propounded craftily
to the? And truly all the world / is replenesshed with this false and
deceitful doctrine. These be the consciences marked with hot yerons / i.
Timo. iiij.
for as all that they do be very clokes and faces / even so all that they teach
be sotle reasons and fained ryedles / so that both in the things and in the
words / are nothing else but clokes and faces / and yet they make a fearful
and scrupelous conscience with out any cause or authorite.

Observe and note with what sober and meke words the sprete does handell these
cruel and odious monstres / for he calls ye abominable pomp and hypocrisye
nothing but faces / which thou can sufficiently and worthily defame with no
word. And he names this pestilent deceavinge of antichrists dottrine. And
this mischevous foxy wiliness to delude men / nothing but rydles. Danie. viij.
This clerly does Daniel in the.vij. prophesye / where he writes that after
the terrible best that had ten horns (which by the consent of all men is the
imperye of Rome) he considered and saw an other little horn spri^s ginge out
of the mids of them (that is ye impery of the Pope which as we said is
spron^^e in the mids of the imperye of Rome* ^^d behold there were eyes like
men's (...) this horn / and a mowth speakinge great and mervelous things.
These eyes be the rydles / and the sotle understanding of these ridles / is
the wisdom of the flesh / and the blasphemous mowthe against Christ.

Ephe. iiij.
Paul in the.iiij. to the Ephesians does much more fersly entreat of these
rydles sainge / let us hence forth be no more children wavering and carried with
every wind of doctrine by the wylynes of men and craftenes where by they lay
away te for us to deceave us. But the two greek words which thapostle uses
have much more mystery then here can be expressed / for the first signifies
not only wylines / but also castinge at dyse / and the second is both a
craftenes / and sotle illusion as it were of iuglers which with their sportes
and pastimes deceave me^nes senses. So these weked masters castinge the words
of god as they were dyse according to their own mind and pleasure / and with
their trifeling ceremonies / deceave us and make us unstable / vndermininge us
with these sotle crafts to make us fall and err / this is their hole intent
that they use their words and deceytfull ceremonies / to vndercrepe us
craftily / and prevely deceave us or we be ware. So he monissheth us in the.ij.
to the Collossians. Collo. ij.
Be ware lest any man come and spoil you through philosophye (...) deceatfull
vanyte / through the trad^^ (...) of men and ordinations after the (...) after
Christ. And a little after even ^s pointinge with his finger to this hidoth and
belly wisdom / does say. After the co^maundmentes and doctryns of men / which
thenges have a similitude of wisdom in chosen holiness and humblenes and in
that they spare not the body / and do the flessh no worshupe un to his need.
Mark how their hydoth has a similitude of wisdom and is but very
superstition and hypocrisye. ii. Petri. jii
And Peter in the.iij. of his second pistell says. There shall come in ye last
days deceatfull mockers which will walk after their own lusts Does he not
here touch both the deceate and the illusion (by cause they deceave in words
and mock and illude in clokes and faces) imputinge the one to the doctrine /
and the other to the works / even as Paul did meaning no nether thing by
this deceate and illusion / Ephe. iiij
but that which Daniel signifies by this word hydoth.

This also must be observed and noted yt this word / understanding / does
pertain unto the mind and affection / for Daniel in the xi. speakinge of the
same monsire does say. Danie. xi^
And he shall have no vndersto^dinge) that is to say mind and affection) to ye
god of his forefathers / another to ye desire of wives / another to any god /
where it is evident that ye word (...) signifye affection / and regard / for
he sha^^ not be so ignorante / not to know what (...) is / what a woman is /
what a wiff is / that it means to desire a woman or a wiff but he shall not
regard them / but make statutes contrary to god and matrimonye / taking no
thought how impossible it is to bear and suffer this bourden of matrimony /
and wedlock which is denied the^. Eve^ so Daniel when he calls this king
wittye / Danie. viij.
and understanding rydles / uses the same manner of speakinge and means
rather the affection and mind / then the understanding. And truly there was
never thing ordened in the world more folisshe and vnsaverye then the Popes
laws. In so much yt they are gested at / ye and abhorred of the very
Canonistes which read and profess them / Proverb.
for they have a proverb among them silf yt a pure Canoniste is a great Ass
/ forther more the world had never imperye whose princes were redyare and
maddere to make laws then the Popes of Rome / so that in their decrees is as
much want of learning as superfluite of folisshe hardenes / and both are above
mesure. What does the Pope in the church bu^daye by day hepe vpe and
accumulate moo new laws / which he stablisshith and cancelleth / confirms
and disanunlleth / chau^geth and rechaungeth / without any cause with out any
reason / eve^ as it comes to his wits end / be ^e drunk or furious. And no
doubt uses and ^^^eth our weke and wretched conscience. Eve^ as they were
dyse / which (when he plays) for his pure pleasure he casts and turns
hither and thethere as he list him silf / ye sometime to his bawdes and
herlottes. O this is a worthy reward for our vnfindnes. ii. Thessa. ij.
Be hold us which would not receave ye love of truth that we might be saved /
are worthily committed in to the hands of this man of sin / and son of
perdinon which through trifeling / lawghinge / and gaminge has laid sins and
perditions upon us / with an incredible and malicious furye.

And to be short we may perceave copiously by the forsaide faces / these sotle
ridles for sith the hole Popes law does nothing else but order these clokes
and faces And sith in the faces is nothing but mockinge and deceavinge by the
which the truth of the faith in the gospel is suppressed it is evident enough
(which experience does teach us) that the Popes doctrine is mockinge and
deceatfull / for he gothe not about to make us serve / obaye / and beleve in
god But only to serve hem and to be subdewed under his jurisdiction. And truly
it were impossible if he were of God / but that he should entreat / move / and
entyse us to the gospel with all his might and power. And teach us plainly
that all things are fre / and that (...) can not sin in vsinge clothinge /
meats / places / parsones / or any soch things / for sin consists not in
the use of things / but in the inordinatte desire or hate of the^ / but the
pope puts sin and righteousness only in the vsinge / therefore he is the man
of sin and son of perdition / filling ye world with these folisshe and
vain / sins and justices. And yet (by cause he fears ye co^scie^ces under
the title and pretense of Christ's name) he makes of those things which in
the^ self are no sins / very grevous offenses. For he that beleveth that he
does sin / if he eat flesh on the Apostles eve / or say not matens and
prime in the morninge / or else leve undone any of ye Popes precepts. No doubt
he synneth. Not by cause the deed which he does is sin / but by cause he
beleveth it is sin and against this folissh belefe and conscience / offe^deth
/ of the which folyssh conscience only the Pope is hedde and author / for a
another doing ye same deed / thinkinge yt he does not sin trvely offends
not. And this is ye cause that ye sprete of Paul co^plaineth that many shall
depart from the faith. ij. Timo. iiij.
And for this folissh conscience / men's tradititions be pernicious and
noisome / the snares of souls / hurtinge the faith / and the liberty of the
gospel / if it were not for this cause they should do no hurt. Therefore the
devil through the Pope abvseth these co^scie^ces to stablissh ye laws of his
tyranny / to suppress ^^e with and liberty / and to replenisshe (...) world
with errors / ungodliness / sins and perditions.

And well does Paul call those consciences marked with an hot yero^ / by
cause they are not so of their own nature / another yet of the sprete / but are
marked against nature with the hot yeron of man's traditions and doctrines /
Paul teaches that there is nothing to be refused. i. Timot. iiij.
And the vicare of Christ says / yes butyre / and whitmeates most be refused
ever on certain prescripte days. Christ in the.x. of luke said. Luc. x
Latinge and drinkinge soch as they have. But his vicare says / ear no flessh
nor eggs. Christ suffers all manner of garments freely and indifferently. But
his vicare commands one manner of raiment to the lay men and takes a another
manner to him silf and his adherentes / and that under deadly sin and precepte
of the church And in all these things they make them self a scrupulous
conscience as though they did well in kepinge them and sinned deadly in
transgressinge / though it be nothi^ge so Therefore truly soch consciences are
violently made / yet nevertheless they be sore hurt (as we have said) in the
transgression of these pain precepts. for soch a king / soch a law. Soch a
law / soch sin and merit and soch a conscience also reserved that (as I
said) of a folishe and vain sin is made a true sin / through the error of
the conscience / and this is the hort yeron which does mark him. It follows.

And his strength shall be stablisshed / and not in his own might and power.
Danie. viij.

This third propertye of this mo^struous kingdom is also mervelous and unlike
all other imperies / by cawse it shall be stre^ghted and stablisshed with a
strange power. For who has hard any soch thing in all other ki^gdoms? The
imperye of Rome was gotten / increased / and mayntened through his own
strength. The hole scripture does rebuke the horses and flessh of Aegipte and
other kingdo^s / in the which the Jews did put their trust and confidence /
forthermore the kingdom of Christ does more consist in his own power then any
of the other. For ye truth of it silf is strong ynowgh. And only this
ki^gdome is stablisshed with others strength Strength in this place does
signifye ye power / which our philosophers do call ye power to work vtwardly
/ which is not of the soul / iii. Reg. xix. Gene. xxxj.
but of the members So Ezechias in the xix. of the fourth book of kings. The
children came to the birth / and the mother had no power to deliver them. And
in the xxxj. of Genesis. I have served your father it (...) all my power. And
Job. I counted f^^ hinge the power of their hands / thu^^ to say that they
were able to do. In the Hebrew tongue it was called ^uth / and the Apostle in
the greek tongue calls it energeran. And the interpreter called it in the
latin tongue / efficaciam / and in the englissh tongue it must be called might
and power as in the.ij. to the Galathians / he that was mighty in Peter in the
apostleshippe over circunsition / the same was mighty in me among the ge^tils.
Gala. ij.


Therefore the power of this king since it sto^deth not in armure / nor in the
gospel of Christ / must needs be raised up by his own doctrines and
stablisshed by the power of other. Mark this goodly order / first are faces.
And then laws / and both are fained and clean alien at from the truth. After
the^ comes his power / which is not sta^lisshed by him silf. But with other
strange powers and strenghtes / for truly a lie can not endure by his own
power. And so has the ki^gdome of Antichrist of Rome prospered / that even in
the apostles time it began to lene and stick to works. Afterward the chirch
(as they call it) was endewed and garnisshed with certain ceremonies. And at
ye length the Pope patched the^ all to gedder and made aswere sauce / and
through them suppressed all liberty / turninge the^ into most strayre and (...)
laws In so much that it is with out (...) ^^re a greater offense to
transgress these laws and ceremonies / then the precepts of god. So of these
faces are spro^ge laws / of the laws the strength / and of ye strength great
power and authoryte as it shall follow / for as manners make a law / so of the
law ryeseth a strength to confirm the manners. And of the strength springs
power and authoryte. Therefore let us consider with what power this king of
perdition is strengthed and stablisshed.

ij. Thessa. ij.
The Apostle in the.ij. of the second pistell to the Thessalonya^s does
attribute and apply it unto satan sainge. Whose cominge shall be through ye
operation of Satan in lyeinge and mervelous signs / for eve^ as Christ did
truly stablissh the faith and his word by signs and miracles through his own
virtue and power. Even so this counterfettinge Ape / and adversarye of Christ /
shall stablissh his faces and lewd laws / through lyeing signs of others
(that is to say Satan's) power. The first operation of Satan in his signs and
illusions is this / that the chirch of Rome has had perpetual contention with
the chirch of ye Grecia^s / and yet being weked and unjust has ever prevailed
(though it were defended / with false causes and wrested scriptures) and so
prevailed yt she has exalted and confirmed her self to be the lady mestres of
the faith and mother of all chirches. Besides (...) subderved all men with
mervel^^^ good chance and prosperyte (were he next also great / learned and
holy) which ever has resisted her laws / statutes / judgments and glorious
pleasurs. Who will not judge yt these were mighty signs and mervelles / that
no man did ever attribute to any / but to god which did fight for ye holy
chirch of Rome. As though god did not utterly abhor this abominable and
pernicyous doctrines of men with ye arrogante pride of these faces.

Now to this point is it brought that kings / princes / and Bisshopes / which
other hurt the holy decrees / libertes or patrimonyes of the chirch of Rome or
else do not honor and prefere them above the precepts of god / shall perisshe
by the stroke of the terrrible swerd of excommunication. Excommunication.
In so much that ye hole world is in a great fear to hurt the Pope or in any
thing to contrary his will. And of this springs the fearful lightninge
which is joined and annexed to ye end of everye bill. If any man through
folissh hardenes presume to contrary or resist our bull and authorite. Let
him knove that he shall run in to the indignation of almightye God and of his
blessed Apostles Peter and Paul. Nether has our savior Jesus Christ in all
his gospel worked soch signs or caused soche fear in the world as has the
pope only in the end of one of his bulls. What is it in the world that ye
pope may not break / change / do / and obtain / since that with this power he
may suppress and put down kings and princes? paraventure these are the
sti^ges of the locustes of the which it is written in ye.ix. of the Apocalipses
/ Apoca. ix.
Did he not set up a new impery at Rome through the power of his laws /
bringinge it (as he says him silf) from the Grecians to the Germans? which
among all the other works of Antichrist was the principal and most mervell /
who thought not that these great signs and works / had comen of god? and yet
they were the most mighty and deceatfull tokens of Satan. We have all seyn the
signs and tokins / but no man took head of the counterfed lies / for in these
the chosen and holy have been deceaved / all though it be clerer then the day
that hey were never done for the gospel and faith / but to confirm the faces
rydles and laws of this king. And by this argument they might sone have been
known. There was never man which prospered / if he rebelled against the Pope
as all the Italian stories make mention / and truth it is that they say (if
thou consider the infelicite of this liffe / name / and loss of goods) In so
much that ye martyrs so were unhappy / ye and chefly Christ himself / But the
Popes sprete (which is (...)) has persuaded that these be the (...) ^eme^^es
of damnatyon / and of the wrath of god although they rather were the signs and
tokens of grace. So has he prevailed with his lyeing merve^s ab^singe our
weak and scrupulous consciences / lest any man should let and withstond the
kingdom of these faces and rydles.

Read the stories / read the decretales / and all which write on these things
/ and se if in any place the Pope and his adherentes complain of kings /
princes / and bishopes by cause they have despised the faith and gospel or else
have offended against god. There is but one complainte / by cause they have not
defended the holy and Apostolic sete of Peter / or have offended it / or hurt
it / in the head / or in the me^bres / so that there is never question for any
thing but for their faces / laws and rydles. And they the^ silf also do
confess (lyeinge with great impudencye) that they did transpose the imperye
to Rome for no another cause / But that the emperor of the Grecyans did to
little defend / the holy sete of Petre* And here may they be convicte through
their own testimony / because they desired not to be defended of Christ but of
a man. Even the^ beginning to depart from the faith / of yt which it is
spoken. Psalm. cxlv.
Trust you not in princes / nor in the ^^^^es of men in whom is no health. And
^^^ine. Psalm. cxvii.
It is better to trust in the lord / the^ to trust in princes / how be it the
Pope unto this day (forsakinge Christ and his tuition) does Crown the emperor
to be the tutor and defender of the chirch* O what a wylye fox is this king of
faces and rydles / he knew well enough that his kingdom could not have
continewed so long (which is clean void vf the sprete and truth) except it
had been defended by the hand and power of man.

It greatly for thinks me and makes me a shamed / ye and to lament for
sorrow / as often as I remember what foles and lawghing stocks the Pope has
made him of the kings / princes / and hole nation of inglonde. Good lord / how
boldly and at his pleasure has he mocked them / leding and tossinge them as
though they had been unreasonable and brute bestes / whom he might abuse to
murder / extorsion / fraud and deceate / ye and to any thing else / that
Satan would entyse the Pope to move and exhort them. Calling them in the mean
ceason the defenders of the faith of Christ. And the beloved children of the
church? O this is a worthy reward by the which they are persuaded to serve
Satan. And yet in all these signs and miracl^ (...) than he has so prevayled
/ that (...) thing which he entendeth to do / (...) be bold to execute it / ye
and he bring^ to (...) to pass prosperously / which he could never do with out
he were helped and so c^^ured by the great works and miracles of Satan. But
what is their intent and what seake they in all these things? Seake they the
glory of Christ? The health of souls? Or the Gospel and faith? Nay forsouth
But only faces and rydles. Only the holy chirch of Rome / and the Apostolyke
seat. The patrimony of Christ crucified / and goods of sanct Peter are the
hole cause and matter of all this troblesome besines. We feall these signs and
tokens well enough And yet through the so^le operation of Satan we can not se
and perceave the lie which is cloked under them / Antichriste has so dymmed
and blinded our eyes / through the holy names of God / Christ / Peter / the
chirch / and soch other / with the which a weak and unlearned conference / ye
and sometime the very chosen / are sone taken and deceaved.

Who is able to number the monstrous mervels / only of them that are departed.
Good lord / what a see of lies has envaded us / of aperinges / coniur^^^^
(...) answers of sprites by the which (...) brought to pass / that the Pope
(...) the king of them that are dead an^ ^^igneth in purgatory / The pope
reigns in purgatory.
to the great disprofite of his prestes (if he continue) which have all their
livinge / riches / and po^pe (...) of purgatory / how be it they should have
less / if they did so well reach the faith of them that live / as they do
ridles of them that are dead. Nether was there since the beginning of the world
any work found of so little labor and great avantage / for truly to this
purposse were gathered almost the possessions of all princes and rich men. And
through these riches sprang up all pleasures and idelnes / and of idelnes came
very Babylon and Sodoma. The sacrament of the altar.
Satan hated the sacrament of the altar / and knew no way how to suppress /
and disanull it. Therefore he found this craft / that the sacrament (which
Christ did only ordene to norissh and stablissh the faith of them that live)
should be counted for a good work and sacrifice / and bought and sold. And so
faith is suppressed / and this wholesome misterye is applied not to the quick
but unto the dead / that is to say another to the quick / another yet to the
dead. O this incredible furye of god. Behold this was the purposse of those
weked sprites which axed masses and fained them selves to be redeemed There are
infinite examples of this monstre / (...) the which we that are the rude mul^^^
(...) out judgment / with out sprete / (...) ^^^linge / as solissh bestes in
to the snare. Nothing consideri^ge these sotle lies / all tough god have not
utterly forsaken us / but in many places has declared manifestly these
illusions. How be it they serve to stablissh this kingdom of faces and rydles.
And so suffers he them to be of some strength.

And though some of a good zele do pray for the dead / yet that the Pope should
reign over them / and that the sacrament of the altar should be his laughinge
stock I utterly defye it and abhor it / and I would to god I might enough
weep at it. Another are these signs / to thencrease of the faith and gospel
(for they are rather against the faith and gospel) But they are done to
stablissh the tyranny of these faces and rydles / and to set up and confirm
the trust in works. How be it concerning faith and the sacrament / we have
spoken copiously in a another place. Among these illusions / are those miracles
to be reputed / which are showed in visitations / pilgrimages / Miracles.
and worshuppinges of sanctes / as there are plenty now adays which the Pope
confirms by his bulls / ye and sometime does canonise the sanctes that the
knows not. Now behold what is the operation of Satan in lies signs / and
what this means that the power and efficacite of these faces and rydles / are
not stablisshed in their own strength.

Be sides these lyeing signs that are wrought by Satan's own administration
There is also a another power which favoreth and vpholdeth this curious king.
And it may be divided in to two members. The one is of the Clerks / and the
other of the lay people. The clerks ministre unto the Pope with their wits
and tongues to stre^gthen his faces / ridles and laws / for he blabbeth the^
out with out any fear And orders his faces with high presumption. Many
times speaking things contrary to hi^silf to his great dishoneste / ye and
sometime (which is most weked) contrary to god / for nether he nor his
adherentes do cast in their minds what good and true things they shall
speak. But only to blabbe out what so ever comes to their wits end /
presuming upon / and abvsing the folissh persuasion of men / which beleve that
the Pope can not err / and therefore sometime his decrees are like the dreams
of drunk and furious men / for he ^reaketh clean with our fear and regard /
and that with soch rechles confidence / and presumptuous pride / that this
detestable and cursed abomination / does sore vex and burn meake hearts /
therefore they that are most learned / quickest of wit / and most religious
being persuaded that this king of faces can not err / do take the dregs /
spitell / and abominable excrementes / of his rydles and laws (and that with
soch affection and honor that a man would wounder at it) and though it be
necessary that a fool mvst speak folisshlye / yet do they commit them silf
unto a miserable pain and labor to gloss / order / make agree / defend / and
to draw this way and that way / what so ever he (with out any regard or
dronken) has belched out of his stomach. Therefore it was well said that he is
not stablisshed with his own power / for he being rude and unlearned / can by
no means defend his own doctrine / with out he had other wits bound un to
him.

Therefore he takes no tought. Nether needs he to be mighty through his own
power / let him but speak a thing in his sleep / and by and by / we have an
article of the faith confirmed through the hole chirch / by other men's
diligence. And there are soch abominable words / of his own motion and
science / and of the fulness of his power and authorite / that we wretched
christen are almost compelled to worshupe for Christ's Gospel / and farte of
this monstres belly.. So does this power stre^gthen and confirm the might and
authorite of this coward / and sleuthfull idolle. Thou may nether read nor
hear any thing of his doing with judgment but all with honor and obedience.
And this persuasion with out doubt is the work of the devil / which occupies
and abvseth our rude minds that he might stablish thorowos (by his souteltye)
the power of his idolle. For if they should be read with judgment / as sometime
men have proved / they should not co^tinew one hour / since in many places they
are clean with out learning / ungodly / and weked / which never can be able to
sustain the judgment and light. This is the point that Satan labored for
in these most holy decrees / to bring it to pass that no man should judge on
the Popes acts. And that it should only pertayne un to him to enterprete the
scripture / and declare the faith / lest that his wickedness and abomination
should be revelated / if a another begine to expound the faith and scripture.

Here of springs the glorious titles / thanks / and Apostolic blissinge /
on all them which defend the holy Apostolic sete / scakinge the good estate
of the Pope / and the privileges of the Chirch of Rome. And contrary wisse he
is so cruel against them that offend and resist / that his fersnes may be a
manifest argument / that he is led with the sprete of Satan / which fears
lest his councels should at any time be opened. A sprete has nether flessh
nether bones and therefore he cannot be fealt. And a lie hates the light /
fearing to be reproved. How beit / it is stablisshed in this king of faces /
al though it be said of all other that the truth is strongest of all things /
and / that no fained thing can long co^tinew / for this monstre is the
greatiste and last of all hydeous monstres.

The seculare power does also serve to this might and authorite / The seculare
arm
and is called the secvlare arm. For the Pope exalted and set vpe above all
princes / powers and imperyes If he can not appresse them that resist him with
his faces / rydles / iudgme^tes and curses (nether does he contend / with
reason / wit / or scriptures since it is re most unnatural and rudest best
geven all to the belly / and much less with faith / patience / prayer / which
are the true Apostolic armure) the^ will he command them to the seculare
power. And sometime he sturreth kings / princes / realms / and nations to
war one against the other wropping the world in blood and murder until he
obtain (not that the faith and gospel would) but that his own faces and
clokes desire. And he prevails in these things so prosperously. Blissinge
them that obey him with the Apostolic benedictio^ / and cursinge them that
rebelle with the apostolic malediction. I pray the how could this
abomination prospere / except Satan's souttellye reigned in ye mids of it?
Some have stablisshed kingdoms with wit and scripture. Some with riches and
strength / how be it this weak and wretched monstre / is mighty / nether with
wit nor wepon / But only with faces with the which he so prevayleth that all
men's wits / learninges / riches / and strength be subject to his pleasure
with soch honor and obedience / that he may play / mock / and order them as
he will. Nether yet does he norysshe the^ with his own stipendes / nor feadeth
them with the true doctrine / But only keeps them in bondage / by the false
illusions of his faces / In so much that they thike them silf to obey god / and
the holy Church of God / Not perceavi^ge that they serve a wretched hog /
and the abomination of the hole earth.

Consider the affection and obedience of kings and princes toward the Pope /
Consider the minds and dispositions of Bisshops / Colleges / and of the
infinite blake cloud of them / that lyve in monasteryes / how that the princes
are ready in armure / And the Bishopes with their company bestow their labors
and wits for the Pope / Not for the faith and word of God (for that is
nothing spoken of) but only to defend these faces / rydles / and laws /
lokinge for no another reward / But that they think that they serve god / and
please him in so doing. The^ shall thou perceave what it means that the
power of this wretched monstre / must be strengthed / by another power and not
by his own. And truly this abomination was not so mete for any time as for
the end of the world / for what is more abominable and mo^struous / then that
soch a kingdom should be of most might / whose prince is most wretched /
sleuthefull / and unprofitable?

But this king is more vicious then Sardanopalus / more delicate then the
Sybarites / Only borne to ryeate and idelnes Not mighty in war policye /
armure nor learning. Nether in the gospel / faith / prayer / nor manners (but
rather abominable in their contraryes). And yet through one face and rydle
rueleth imperyes / kingdoms / and all powers / havinge in his jurisdiction our
goods / bodies / and souls to use and abuse / them to his wretched pleasure /
Geving nothing again / but thanks / and the benedictio^ of the apostolic
feate / that is to say the smoke and vanite of all vanites and trifelles.

Forthermore (that any man would mervell at) Other princes which reign with
war and strength are beloved faithfully of their subjects. Likwisse masters
/ and teachers which are excellent in wit and learning / are honored of
their disciples / but to this wretched and most rude mo^stre every man wissheth
a mischeffe. There is no man but he abhors this his great power There is no
man / but he curses his superfluite of riches countinge them set in a weked
place. And yet they are deceaved by the illusions of these faces and rydles /
and are feared with signs and monstrous lies / and so abstain. There is no
man / but he seith that the Pope and his adherentes refusinge the faith /
gospel / pacyence / and other armure spitituall / lyve under superstitious
faces / and deceatfull rydles / and that after ye most wordly manner and yet
they perceavinge this / and fealinge evidently that Christ is farther from them
/ the^ the west from ye est / dare not affirm and say that they think. For
the religious persons and the other faces of the Pope / do object like bold
champyons / that we ought to obey the imperye all though the prince be evil /
as though we speak only of the Popes person and not much rather of the
iniquite of the popedom and office it silf. It is a another kind of impery that
the Pope does exercise / and far unlike the powers of this world which
whether they be good or evil hurt nothing if they be suffered / how be it
the popedom is soch a power that it suppresseth the faith and gospel.
Settinge up in their stead faces and rydles / the faces instead of faith / and
rydles for the gospel. Therefore he is an adversarye to Christ / which is
mighty in the sprete of faith / against clokes and faces. And in the word of
truth against deceatfull rydles. Therefore the malice and iniquite of the power
and office is reproved and not of the prince / for the power is soch that it
ca^ not be administered by a good prince / but by the adversarye of Christ
which yaninge and routinge most observe his faces and ridles / against the
faith and word of god.

And therefore it is called abomination that with out strength and with out
learning. Only by the idell pomp and pride of faces / he oppresses all
men's wits. So that he may / and does all things / which could not be
brought to pass nether with the strength of any kingdom / nether yet with the
diligence of any wit / ye soch things as Christ him silf never did / with
his word among men. Were it not a foull abomination / if that a sow should
rule the good man of the house / and all that are in the house. Doing nothing
else / but lie on the dunghill and deceave men's sight by some illusion /
Apperinge as he were a noble man and did speak certain things as men do / as
we have read that idolles of wodde and stone / have done among the gentiles?
Even so the Pope under the pretense of the name of god (whose name every man's
conscience does fear / love / and honor) does easily draw men from the faith
in to superstitious and most pestilent abominations / ye the greatest kings /
and best learned men. And yet he him self (even like a sow) walowinge up and
down in the filthy durte of his shamfull and wretched life / is nether learned
/ nether mighty in armure / no not worth on hawe.

ij. Petri. ij.
And in this matter let us hear thapostle Peter speakinge most sharplye in
the.ij. of the second epistle / where he painteth the popedom and sets it
out with his colors to the uttermost point / for after that he had prophesyed
that false masters should come which in covetuousnes with fained words should
make marchaundise of the people of Christ / which should bring in sects of
perdition. And draw many after them / Eve^ deniyng Christ that has bought
the^ / the^ does he fear them with.iij. notable examples. Of the Angels. Of
the floude that was in the time of Noe. And of the Zodomites. And he says
that all these were / punisshed of god / for thexample of the weked which should
come / the^ he prosequutinge his matter (as concerning these weked mastres)
does say Namlye the^ that wall after the flessh in the lust of uncleanness /
and despise the ruelars / Presumptuous are they and stubborn / and fear not to
speak evil of them that are in authorite / Peter speaks not of them that do
not obey Bisshoppes / but (as he began) of the weked mastres them silf / that
is to say of Bisshopes / Cardinals / and the Pope / for these are they that
this epistle speaks of. First who seyth not that the Popes sect above all
other walks after the flessh in the lust of uncleanness? For since they are
forbidden matrimonye / and abound in riches and idelnes / what should they do
but walk after the flesh? They labor not / as other men do / therefore their
iniquite springs with their fat / Nether can thou assign me any masters
and ruelars of the people / which do thus / but only the papists. The clerks
are daily increased / and matrimonye forbid (and both through the rule and
authorite of the Pope) and every man may perceave what profit comethe unto the
chirch by it / for alas where as by matrimonye many women might be good and
please god livinge chastlye / they are now compelled to be harlottes / and that
for.ij. causes the one is ye misshevous entyesinge through gifts and fair
words that these venomous locustes use. The other is yt their is soch scarsnes
of clean men out of his orders that they are not sufficient to the hole nature
of women. So that if this should long continue it would be the destruction of the
hole world.

Besides that / they despise rulars / who does so but the Popedom / and the
sect of papists? What calls he the ruelars and powers / but princes and
worldly officers? For the Bisshopes and successors of thapostles have not
rueles and powers / but services and administration. And are called the
servantes of ye Chirch of Christ as Paul says in the first to the
Collosya^s. Colo. ^.
Is not this the dispisinge of powers and rueles / to exempte hi^ silf by his
own authorite from tribuetes / subjection / and all bourdens of ye commonwealth? Paul commands in the xiij. to the Romans to geve tribute / custom
and honor to them / ^ Petri. ii.
that it is dew to. And Peter will that we be subject un to kings / and to
all manner ordinances of man / how be it the Pope contrary wisse does exempte
his own person and possessions / ye and all his adherentes promulgatinge
serse and cruel laws / condemninge them (no^ to one hell) that will hear the
voice of Paul or Peter / and to bring his shawelinges in to an order /
requiringe and exactinge tribuete / honor and their duetye. And now is he so
far from honouringe of these powers / that he will tell skorne to admit them
to kiss his holy feate. forthermor he exalts every pressed and monk though
they be as rude as stocks / and more weked the^ any baude / above all the
nobles and princes of the world / by cause he is marked with his worshupfull
sign and character. Crakinge in his most weked rydles and laws / of maiorite
and obedience. That the Pope excels the emperor as the son does the moon.
Insomoch that of those most wretched dregs of men / which are avaunced by the
Popes mageste / the powers are despised / ye and compelled to honor those
idolles of whom they ought to be honored them silf. And I pray you in what
ruele and power reign not these clouds of abominable men?

It is a mervelous thing how aptly Peter calls them / ii. Petri. ii.
presumptuous and stubborn for after they have obtained this yt they them silf
only are called spiritual / and all the other seculare and temporal (as even
now they abuse the words at their own pleasure) there is nothing but they
dare behold to take it apo^ them under the name of this spiritual sect /
forthermore if they have presumed to take any thing on hand / how invincible /
stiff / and hard hearted they are / until they have prevailed so fare that
they may with full authorite and with out regard blaspheme the gloryes and
powers Does not the pope being but a small worm of the earth (how be it
enflamed with ye sprete of Satan) Curse / excommunicate / and rebuke with all
kinds of checkes the highest kings and ruelars when he list? All though he
was ordened only to bless the^. Nether yet does he that by cause the kings
resist the Gospel and the faith. But because they can not suffer and maintain
the superfluous riches of these shavelinges and holy chirch of Rome with their
most weked manners and intolerable tyra^nye / or else that they resist the Popes
ungodliness and iniquite. And this means ye Apostle when he says / they fear
not to speak evil of the^ that are in authorite. ii. Petri. ii.
Nether is the Popedom counted in the name of power and mageste. Nether yet (if
it were so counted) has it suffered any soch thing. Since that no power hither
to has prevailed against him. But contrary he has so prospered against the
powers / that he may sport and play him not only in the matters of inferior
people / but also in the powers and magestes as is will lies / transposinge
them. Puttinge in and out / ad Chaungeinge them as often as he thinks best.
Do not the stories of the kingdoms / of France / Greece / germanye / Neapoles
/ Sicilye and soch other imperyes thus resufye? Did not l^^ ye tenth (which of
him silf was a good man) being deceaved by the councels and examples of his
adherentes Assaute with this tyranny the dukedo^s of Italye / which was
expulsed from vrbine / and often beseaged Ferraria? And the Cardinals and
Busshopes do counterfete him full nobelye / for the Cardinals are made
superiores to kings / and Bisshopes to princes. O this most wretched kind of
men / which is scante worthy to feade hogs / thus they honor ye powers /
thus they bless ye magestes / thus seake they other me^nes profittes
displeasing them silves / thus put they away presumptuous boldness / and walk
in the fear of God / woo be to them.

Of these Judas (following Peter) does say likewise these dremers (that is to
say deluded by dremers) defile the flessh / Jude. i.
despise ruelars and speak evil of the^ yt are in authorite. And a little
before. There are certain craftelye crepte in of which it was written before
time un to soch judgment. They are ungodly / and turn the grace of our lord
God un to wantannes / and deny god the only lord and our lord Jesus Christ.
According to that which Peter says. They shall craftily bring in their own
traditions / and sects of perdition under the cloak of the gospel of Christh
with the which the true faith of the gospel of Christ shall be suppressed. And
Christ (though they retain his name) shall in very deed be denied to be ye
only lord and king in righteousness and truth. And under his name shall they
serve their belie pleasures / and wanton desires / finally / ye pistle of Jude
which sometime seamed to me unprofitable. Now do I knowledge yt it was extracte
out of the pistell of Peter / and only written to declare the Pope. And both of
them show / that they shall prevelye crepe in / that is to say. Bring in their
own tradito^is under the gospel / as Peter says. They shall craftily bring
in sects / openinge plainlye their sotle and deceatfull illusions / by the
which (reservinge the name of the Gospel of Christ) they preach and stablissh
their own doctrines.

ij. Petri. ii.
But let us go forth with Peter sainge / when the angels which are greater
both in power and might / receave not of the lord raylinge judgment against
them / but these as bruete bestes (for the papists now adays no doubt beleve
not that the soul is immortal and specially at Rome) naturally made to be
taken and destroyed (O what a similitude is this) speak evil of that they
know not / that is to say / condemning the doctrine of Christ / for their own
inventio^s likewise says judas. They blaspheme those things which they know
not to their own destruction. And also as Judas says. Jude. i^
In tho things that they know naturallye (as bestes which are with out reason)
they corrupt them selves. So shall they perissh receaving the reward of their
unrighteousness (which they call high justice / as obeyinge of the chirch. And
observinge of religions) Reputinge it a great pleasure to use for a day this
delicious and deintye world (that is to say / they are bestes servinge the
belie which count this thing for the cheffe and best / if they have abundance
in this short liffe / for there is in a manner another Bisshope / pressed / nor
religious man made / but to thentent that he may lyve well in idelnes and
devour (not laboring them silf) that which the poor get and yerne with much
swett and labor. ii. Petri. ji^
They are filthye spots (for these men are nothing but sclaunderous and
weked spots among the people of God / since they are clean unprofitable /
fed up and fatted with delicious plesurs / and vices in the chirch / and so
serve them silf and their belyes. ii. Petri. i^
And of ^oue they make a laughinge stock / feastinge to gedder in their
deceavable ways. This place seems some deall to be corrupt. for Judas
recieteth the same on this manner. Jude. i^
These are spots which of your kindness feast to gedder with out fear
fedinge the^ selves / for he describes ye delicate liffe of bisshopes /
prestes / and religious persons which spend and pour out with all prodigalite
ye substance / yt has be geve^ and is encreassed daily through the godly
devotion and charity of ye faithful. Nether fearinge the sight of god nor man.
Nether yet any thing moved by gevinge evil occasion to the weak / nor fore
the hate of good me^. They take curious head to the^ silf. And feed the^ silf
daintelye. And are nothing else / but spots filthiness / sclaunder / and a
burden to the chirch where as they should be the highest and most beutefull
garnisshi^ge / lights and pillars. So not we se all these things verefied?
Therefore the faing of Peter (Of you they make a mockinge stock feastinge to
gedder in their deceaveble ways) must be understand / that they feast with
your riches / ii. Petri. ij.
or as Judas shows / Jude. i
with your kindness and charity / for they abose both you and your goods to
their own po^pe and wa^ta^nes / with out any fear. And as I think it is the
fault of the prenter which did put it so / for ignorance / because ye words
and letters in the greek are so like.

ii. Petri. ii.
It follows / havinge eyes full of advoutrie. Good lord / with what sharp and
vehement words does thapostle inveye against the^. He does attribute un to
the^ the eyes of and come^ woman / ye is to say insatiable. And we se yt
their lust ca^ never be sa^^at and fulfilled) And yt ca^ not cease to sin
(yt is to say) who^ no man ca^ dissuade from i^iquites / for they will vex
and persequ^te the^ with most weked and unequal judgments / which will
complain of the defilinge of their own wises or daughters / for they ab^se by
violence whom they lift. Eve^ as we read of the Gigantes in the.v. of Genesis
before ye floude. Genesis. v.
Nether is it lawful to resist the^ / nor to call them in to the court /
nether yet to speak against them / for they are spiritual and exempt)
Begilinge unstable souls ( ij. Petri. ij
for through their pestilent example thye draw many that are weak from the
faith) ij. Petri. ij.
Hertes they hare excersised with covetuousnes (Can thou have any thing more
aperly spoken against the court of Rome and the clergy? Who is able to number
the crafts that through their covetuousnes they have invented? ij. Petri. ij.
They are now well excersised / and have a proper custom to despoile / deceave
/ and pluck away) They are cursed children / and have forsaken the right way
and are gone astraye / folowi^ge the way of Balam the son of Bosor. (I am in
doubt whether this place be also corrupt / or else whether purposly Peter did
call him the son of Bosor / who^ Moses in the.xxij. of Numeri called ye son
of be or except ye Balams father had.ij. Nume. xxij.
names both Bosor and Beor / both of them encreasse thabominatio^ of this
misshevous example / for Bosor does signify the flessh. And Beor a fool. And
where as Peter says / that ye mad folisshnes of the prophet was rebuked of
the Ass / he touches this word Beor but in that he loved the reward and luker
/ he noted bosor. And balaam (or as the truth of the hebrewe has Bileam) does
signify the people of no reputation / or the pain people / or they that are
not counted for people All these sainges are sharp and ferse against the
covetousnes / wantannes / and ungodliness of Bisshopes and prestes / which are
made folissh and carnal / and are wexed gross / forsakinge to be the people
of god. Another only for this cause does he liken them to Balam / but also that
they are cursed chldre^ as he was / which geving council to the Moabites /
through the ydoll Beelphegor did greatly corrupt and destroy the Israelites.
Nume. xxiiij Nume. xxv.
And this hole storye here does Peter apply unto the bishops / which
reysinge up the idol of their own doctrines and traditions. And havinge to do
with the harelottes of ye Madianites (that is to say with the delicious and
voluptuous plesurs of this world) begile unstable souls / and besides ye do
speak evil (as it is said before) of ye way of truth and glory. Eve^ as
he went about / to curse the people of god.

Which loved the reward of vnrightewesnes. ij. Petri. ij.
But was rebuked of his iniquite / the tame and dome beast speakinge with
man's voice forbade the folishnes of the prophet (behold the covetousnes and
folishnes of bisshoppes which are geven so hedling to covetuousnes / that they
are more insensible then brute bestes) These are wells with out water (by
cause they have the shape and name of sheperdes with out the work and office /
as Zacharias in the.xi. says. O thou sheperd and idol) And rackes carried
about of a tempest (Rackes are like clouds / but they geve no rain. Even so
these are carried under the title / and in the place of shepardes / and they
teach nothing / but rather are tossed through their wordly affections unto
every motion of satha^s will) To whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever
/ good lord / how fearful are these things? Who would not fear to be counted
among the number of these shave linges / against whom all these things are
prophesied with a hole and full sprite? ii. Petri. ij.


For when they have sownded the swellinge words of vanite / they begile with
wa^tannes through the lusts of the flessh them yt were clean escaped. It is
mervell if this place do not chefly pertain to vniversites and studyes of the
canon law / for we se with what pride Antichrist sou^deth in everye place of
his decrees / where he says / we Command / bedding and Commanding you
straytlye / and soch other proud words he has / with ye which he does
occupye all schools. So ye Peter does well call the not speakers / but sounders
/ for they are nothing but very voices / and the teachers of most vain vanite
/ And yet with these infections they have entised and seduced ye more noble
part of ye faithful / which studcige this vain and trifelinge doctrine /
apply and follow their own pleasure and desires. For who is in these
uniuersites which studieth not for the^re^t of luker and glory / or yt
afterward he may live ye more idellye? yet will I not speak of yt / how many
souls do perish by ye lascivious life / and lice^s of these universities.
Breflye to conclude. The cano^ law causes ye people of Colleges and schools
to be geven only to vanite / riot / wa^ta^nes / idelnes / po^pe and pride. And
yet with an incredible noise ye presumptuous pope with his Apostles does bost
and co^me^d in his decrees / their state / riches / and hypocrisye. So that
Peter may truly call ye cloak and out ward face of godliness / religion / and
co^ninge (wherewith this people is so greatly bolne) ye swellinge words of
vanite / for they are in very deed drenched and destroyde in voluptuous
pleasurs. This se^ce does Judas help sainge / whose mouths speak proud
things wo^deringe at faces / Jude. j.
and having the^ in revere^ce be cause of ava^tage / here calls he faces /
the persons / clokes and po^pes which we spoke of before / for this king of
faces / displayeth his noble titles / privileges / libertes and soch other. ij.
Petri. ij.


And he does very well adioyne / Them that were clean escaped / but now are
wropped in errors. As I think thus it means That what thing so ever was
clean delivered from sin through baptime and ye word of god / after it had
grown and increased a certain ceason was drowned and suppressed under their
laws and doctrines. So that they are compelled to be wropped in errors (all
though through Christ they have escaped clean) which is done while they run
hedelinge from faith in to ceremonies / from the sprete in to persons / from
grace in to works / from the truth in to cloked hypocrisye / and the hole
pomp of faces / through the most weked decrees of their presumptuous vanite.
They promise them liberty and are themselves the bond servantes of corruption.
This does both pertain to pardons / and to all the deceatfull illusion by the
which they commend their cloked faces and say they are good / Affirminge that
who so ever walk in them / should be cownted to walk holelye and godly. For so
are the orders of prestes / monks / and of the hole clargye avaunced / that
they only are counted to be in the state of health / and all other are reputed
wordly and seculare / forthermore / they fell their labors / merits / and
masses / And promise forgevnes of sins. How be it they are the bo^d servantes
of corruption / that is to say they teach nothing but vain and corruptible
things (and that he thoucheth in the.ij. to the Collosyans sainge) Col. ij.
which all perish with ye vsinge of them / and are after the commaundmentes and
doctrines of men. And yet be cause they teach men to put confidence in them /
through that are they the authors of eternal corruption and damnation.

How be it the tenor and concordance of the scripture does so lie / that it
compels us to take and understand the bond scroantes of corruption / for
them that are the subtectes of sin. So that the sense is / sith they them
selves with their weked hypocrisye and manifest vices do perish then presume
they to profit other and bring them to health cmmunicatinge unto them their
brotherheddes and pardons. And it folowith. For of whom so ever a man is
overco^ / un to the same is he in bondage. ij. Petrij. ij
So we not here daily / that ye Pope (though he be a mischevous and weked man)
does presume to dispe^ce the merits of Christ and of his saincres and open
heve^ with his fayes to who^ he will? And the hole multitude of this clergy
follow him. So a weked mand chalengeth ye treasure / of the chirch into his
own hand / And he him self being the bond servant of corruption goth abuote to
delivere other. ij. Petri. ij.
Therefore Peter does conclude that the chirch of Rome with his Pope is returned
to worse gentilite / then it was before / sainge / for if they (after they have
escaped by faith from the filthiness of the world through the knowledge / Math.
xij.
of the lord and of the savior Jesus Christ / are yet tangeled again therein /
and overcome / then is the latter end worsse with the^ / the^ the beginning /
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of rightewesnes
(that is to say of faith) then after they have known it / to return from the
holy commandment geven un to them (which is of faith in Christ) It is
happened unto them according to the true proverb. Prover. xxvi
The dog is turned to his vomet again. And the sow after she is washed is
/ returned to her wallowinge in the mire. Eve^ so do wese that in the Popes
kingdom faith is extincte. And that we now are worse gentilles / then ever we
were. And for this we may thank the abominable rydles and laws of this king
of faces / which Peter and Judas (as we se) have described and painted
effectuouslye / with his saces and exterior powers. Now follows the fruit and
final work / of them.

Danie. viij.
And he shall corrupt mervelous things.
This word / mervelous / in the hebrewe is called niphlaoth and in other places
is translated / great / mystical / and secret / as in the xj. of Daniel /
Danie. xi.
He shall speak great words against the god of gods / And this word /
Gene. vj.
corrupt / signifies here as it does in the.vj. of Genesis where it is written
that ye earth was corrupt / and that all flessh had corrupt / their way / and
that god would corrupt / or destroy them with the earth. So that parave^ture we
might say better in this place /

And he shall corrupt great things.
And Daniel is indifferent to be taken.ij. ways. Other to understand those
great and mervelous things / which this king shall invade to corrupt them.
Or else his works that he does / exercise in corruptinge other things /
signifiinge that his acts be mervelous and incredible / And this latter sense
does our interpreter follow / whom also we will follow / all though the first
sense be even as true / for / no doubt / they are great and mervelous things
which he does corrupt / but they are only known and attained by faith.
Therefore the sense shall be / He shall corrupt mervelouslye / and shall be as a
great and incredible corruptor / he does not describe what evil good things /
shall suffer of him / But what great abominatio^ he should work against good
things / shewinge his fortune and prosperity.

Therefore he speaks not of violent corruption and destruction / as tyrants
spoil and destroy kingdoms and contres through wars and violence of armure /
for soch a king as he is / soch a destroyer is he also / that is to say he
shall do all things with faces and rydles / which shall not be stre^ghthed by
armure / wit / nor learning / but through a strange and outward power as the
next verse does specifye / which says. And he shall prosper / and shall do /
and shall corrupt strong men / and the people that are holy / and deceate
shall prosper in his hand. It follows therefore that he destroys not Cytes
and provinces / but rather those things which are wont to be suppressed of
these faces / rydles / and deceates / and which are clean contrary to them
that is to say the truth and word of truth the sprete and plain symplenes /
which is the faith in Christ / and kingdom of good consciences / and that
Christ calls the kingdom of God / the kingdom of heven and the kingdom of
truth. For so before pilate he confesses and knowlegeth that his kingdom is
the kingdom of truth for he says every man which is of the truth hears my
voice. Joan xviij.
Wherefore this ki^ge which is the destroyer of the kingdom of heven / and
corruptour of the simplicite which is in Christ Jesus (as it is said to the
Corinthia^s) is no another but very Antichriste teaching in sted of the faith /
works / for the truth / a cloked vysare / for secreat mysteryes / outward
faces / for the gospel / laws and rydles / for pure clennes sotle crafts /
and for the word of god / their own traditions and decrees / so destroing the
consciences / and corruptinge the sprtte.

Let us now judge whether the pope fulfill this part. First this is evide^t
that through Christ all sins were so damned and taken away / i. Timo. j.
that also the occasion of sin (which is the law) did not remain / but was
supp^essed / for through the faith he made all things / fre. So that a christen
should work nothing by the co^pulsion of the law / but all through the sprete
of liberty / as Paul says in the.j. of the first epistle to Timothe. The
law is not geven to a righteous man / for what so ever is done by compulsion
of the law is sin / for it is not done with a glad and willinge sprete / but
with a contrary will and rebellinge against the law / and this truly is
sin. ij. Co. in. iij.
Therefore in the.iiij. of the second epistle to the Corinthia^s he calls the
preachers of the new testament the ministers of the sprete and not of the
letter because they teach grace and not the law. Wherefore in the hole new
testament are there no urgent and grevous precepts. But only exhortatio^s to
observe those things which were very necessary to our health. Nether did
Christ and his apostles at any time compel any man. And the holy ghost was for
that cawse called paracletus / that is to say an exhorter and co^forter. And
here is theffecte of the hole matter / yt they are the people of Christ / which
willingly do hear and follow him / not for any fear of the law / but only
entysed and led with a gracyous liberty and faithful love / Not doing any
thing be cause it is commanded / but because it is pleasant and acceptable
unto them / though it were not commanded / for they ye would do otherwisse
should be counted the people of the law / and synagoge / wherein the
transgressers were killed. Wherefore in the.xix of Matthew / he speaks
co^ditionally / Math. ^ix.
if thou wilt enter keep the commaundmentes. And in the.v. of Matthew he says
not / Dat. v.
I will that you be poor but he exhorts them ge^tyll ye saying / blessed
are the poor in sprete / and so forth. And to be short in the new testament
are all things declared which we ought to do and leve undone / what reward is
ordened for them that do and leve undone. And of whom to seake / find and
obtain / help and conforte to do and leve undone. But no man is compelled
(Every man is suffered other to perissh or to be saved) but accordinhe to their
own will. Therefore in the.xviij. Math. xviij.
of Matthew he theacheth that a rebellion should not be kilde / but avoided and
put out of cumpanye / like a gentill.

So he has not delivered us from the law / but from the power and violence of
the law / which is the very true losinge / gevinge all men liberty at their
own peril to do other good or evil. But for all that he has not taken a
way from the powers and officers their right / swerd / and authorite to
punisshe the evil / for soch pertain not to his kingdom until they are made
spiritual / and then freely and with a glade heart serve god. And since these
things are so in the precepts of god (much more they are of value in the
ceremonies / which are clean vanisshed away) so that we can not offend against
them / let us thank our father which has plucked this yoke from our necks.
And desire faith of him / which faith only is most sufficient un to our
justification / but since this king of faces the Pope does nothing but command
and compel in all his decrees / and that in the sted and name of God / it is
evident enough how that he is the adversarye of Christ / and the corruptor of
the new testament / ye and the Enimye of the Christen lybertye. Compellinge
me^ against their wills to do ye works which he commands them / through the
which tyranny he is the author of so many sins be cause the works are done
of no glad mind / for while they think that they are bound to his
commandments / they have a blotte in their scrupelous consciences if they
omit any thing / and yet be cause they do it with an evyll will truly they
offend in their hearts / where as they should not have offended / through their
resistinge and hati^ge will of the law / if he had commanded nothing / but
only exhorted and desired. And contrary wisse to them that obey him / he is the
author of false feigned righteousness / for while they beleve that they have done
well / and repute their obedience for justice / they are brought to this
blindness that they think they are good / not through the faith of Christ / but
by these laws and works. And thus truly does he corrupt the faith and
truth / both multiplye and encreasse evyll consciences / and make feigned good
co^sciee^es. And since he does so through all the world / it is evident what a
corrupter and dispoylare he is / for even so many he corrupts / as he has
subdewed and led under his laws and imperye. And who is be in the world that
is not subject under him. Except they be infantes or paraventure some simple
persons / which are reserved by the inscrutable council and provision of god?
O thou man of sin. O thou son of perdition. O thou abomination. O thou
corrupter. O thou author of evil consciences. O thou false master of good
consciences. O thou ennimye of faith and christen liberty / who is able for to
rehearse / ye or contain in his mind the infinite waves of this monstrous
kings evilles?

How be it the end of these mischevous evils are not yet come. If he had
ordened these his laws / in those works of virtues that are commanded in
the.x. precepts / or else in soch as the philosophers and natural reason did
describe / as are justice / strength tempera^ce / Chastity / mildnes / truth /
goodness / and soch other. Paraventure they should only have made a Sinagoge / or
else have ordened in the world a certain civil justice / for through these also
faith should have been corrupted / as it was among the Jews / how be it now he
keeps not him silf with in these bonds / but rvnneth ry^ot more at large
raysinge infinite tempests of mischeffe (yet are we compelled to say he does
no hurt) for he entyseth and drives us to cerimonyes and his own feigned
traditions / as to places persons / clothinge / meattes and days / and binds
us (like asses / and ignorant foles / ^ee and stocks) un to them with an
indissoluble bond enduringe our hole lives / so that it makes me sorye and
asham^ of this pernicious abomination / and makes me utterly abhor it un to
death / for Christ (as I have said) taking away all laws to make us fre and
at liberty / did most of all suppress and disanulle the ceremonies which did
consist in places / persons / garments / meattes days and soch other / so
that their use should be to all men most fre and indifferent / nether
addressinge the conscience to sin / nor yet to justice which is obtained
through only faith in Christ. How be it the Pope not content / at the lest with
those places / meats / clothinges / and days / which were prescribed in the
law of moses. Does werye corrupt / and destroy / the christian congregation
with new observations / other invented by his own pregnant wit / or ^ls by
the sotle imagination of his adherentes / which also he does encreasse daily
and command after his own lust / and that you may perceave this the more
evidently / we will use certain examples after the manner of an induction to
rote and stablissh it in you.

Christ taking away the difference of all places will be worshupped in every
place. Nether is there in his kingdom one place holy / and an other profane
and with out holiness But in everye place all things are indifferent. Nether
can thou more heartily and better / beleve trust / and love god in the temple
qwire / altar / and chirch yerd / then in thy barn / vineard / kichen / and
bed. And to be short the martyrs of Christ have honored him in dark dongeons
and presons. And sancte agnes. In the s^ues for gat not her redemer. But the
Pope does consecrat Churches gevinge great pardon and privileges un to the
halowinge. Making strait laws to condemn their consciences / ye other in
sport or else in ernest do violate the house that they have hallowed / which
should nothing offend if they had hurt their own houses or any other man's.
Be sides that if thou obey the Popes commaundmentes / thou art made a
religious man / and an obedient and faithful son of the church / thou have
found a conscience of a good and rightuous weak Now compare Christ and the
Pope to gedder. Christ says. There is no sin committed through the vsinge of
any place except it be to the hurt of thy neghbour. The Pope says. It is
sin if thou do any bodily work in the chirch. Or else if thou count it not
to be more holy then a comen house. Does not the Pope here make sin in vsinge
of those places / in ye which christ makes none but dimitteth us fre? Does not
ye Pope make a scrupelous conscience / where as Christ sets us at liberty?
Does not ye pope orde^ through his doctrine / bondage / fear / captivite /
snares and ioperdeys where as christ settethe sure co^fide^ce and fredo^. Is
not the^ the Pope Antichrist / ye author of sin and consciences / by his
tryfelinge / folissh / unprofitable / and weked laws? what needs any christian
these laws and observa^ces unto justice? O this deceauinge and childissh
illusio^ which is worthy to be laughed (...) and yet is it of soch strength and
might that it causes great sin and perdition.

Christ teaches ye justice or his worshupe consists not in these places.
Actuum. vii. Ioannis. iiij.
But ye pope says ye it is justice and worshupe of god to bild chirches / to
halow the^ / to prefer the^ above come^ houses for ye holiness which is geven
unto the^. O what a worthy religion is this for this idolle? how mete and
co^veniently did Christ provide / yt the co^secratio^ of chirches and belles
should only pertain to bisshopes? truly it is even a mervelous mete office for
a bisshoppe.

For soch as the bisshopes are soch should also their works be. And they are
nothing but idolles / and visars (while that they set aparte their office of
preachinge) and are only Bisshoppes in titles and apparel. Therefore it was not
convenie^t that they should sancrifie the faithful souls (that is to say the
very chirch of God) with their word and prayer / but rather to anoint and
sprintell with holy water belles / wodde / and stones / in which myse / spiders
/ and birds might dwell / and not Christ. So a stock does consecrate stocks
/ a stone stones / a block blocks / a painted visare / visars / and an ydolle
idolles / and in all points he him silf is like that he haloweth. And yet in
reachinge / kepinge / and garnisshinge these things / good lord / what laws
and glosses are there / inve^ted / what scrupulosite of conscience what cases
reserved / what penance and satisfactions are there imagined for the
tra^sgression of the^. And our most revere^d father does very hardly forgeve
these feigned sins. I tell you not with out monye / he will sooner a great
deall remitte advoutrye and the most mischivous offenses that ca^ be against
god / ye and rather then fail maynte^ you in the^. forthermore with what
great pardons does he reward these justices. And it is very well ordered / for
soch sinners are worthy soch remissions. And soch rightuousmen ought to be
crowned with soch rewards so yt the indulgences and absolutions must be as
true / as are the sins and justices. O this abominable abomination.

Likewisse. Christ did put no difference in mea^tes and days as the apostle
teaches in many places. Galath. iiij.
Nether would he that in the use of any meat or any day there should be sin /
for in the gospel the use of meat is not reproved / but only the
concupiscence of meat. But this most holy adversarye of Christ / nothing
regardinge the concupiscence does forbed through the authorite of god and under
his name / the use of flesh / Milk / eggs / butyre and soch other / through
all the lent / and other certain days which he has prescribed to be fasted
/ making and ordeninge his folisshe fast not in refrayninge the concupiscence
/ but in forbeddinge the use / i. Timo. iijj.
as Paul in the.iiij. of ye first epistle to Timothe did prophesy upon him
saying. Forbigginge to mary / and co^maundinge to abstain from meattes /
which God has created to be received with gevinge thanks. wherefore here also
are sins made through the weked will of this man of sin / where as of their
nature they were fre and with out sin. And he binds to these things /
men's consciences / and vexes them with folisshe laws. In so much ye the
rude people now a days do abhor nothing so vehemently as the transgression
of these fasting days. And put their confidence so much in no thing as in
this fast of the Pope / for they count it a thousand times less fault / to
kille to do adoutrye and to stele / then for to have eaten eggs / but^re /
milk or flesh in the lent ceason. Nether is this master of the chirches /
the fontayne of laws and righteousness / the shepard of the hole congregation /
and head of the catholic chirch / moved any whitte to mercy and co^passio^ /
by cause the faith is thus suppressed / and weke co^scie^ces thus wickidly
brought in to errors / but rather reioyseth in this destruction of souls /
and corruptinge of faith / ye and calls upon them and constr^yneth the^to it
Nether will he ever forgeve the transgression of one of his laws until he be
well moyned.

Since the^ the pope does make sin / where Christ takes it away / and
ordeneth justice where Christ says is none. And does bind and snare
co^scie^ces where Christ does set the^ fre. And does all things clean
contrary / puttinge sin in the stedde of grace and the law in sted of the
faith / do thou yet doubt whether he be the very antichrist and abomination
standinge where it ought not stond? Are not these contarye / Christ says here
is no sin / the pope says yes here is sin. Christ says here is no
justice / b^th the pope says yes here is justice. If he would suffer them
indifferent or else only would exhort men un to them / he should not be
antichrist / but now be cause ^e commands it in in the name of Christ
(though he lie) and does exact it under the pain of dedly sin / he does
utterly corrupt ye chirch / suppress ye faith / avaunce sin and destroy the
consciences of the christen.

Of this kind are all the worshuppinges of vesturs / vessels / and relikes /
where of spring a fayer sort of sins. If a nun / ^ouch the superaltare or
the corpores / as they call it) there is a sin committed / to touch the
chalice it is a great transgression / to say mass with an unhallowed chalice
is a grevous offense / to do sacrifice in vestimentes which are not consecrated
is a careful crime / It is also reputed for a sin if in ministeringe any
sacrament / he lack any orname^t that pertayneth thereunto. If he call a child
or speak in the words of the canon He offends also that does stammer or
stutte in the words of the canon / he synneth that touches the holy relikes
of saints / And he that touches the sacrament of the altar other with hand
or singer though it be for necessite to pluck it from the rouffe of his mouth
commits soch vilonous iniquite / ye they will scrape and shape of / the
quick flesh of the part which did touch it / so that very madness it self
can not be more out of order and resone / I think at the length they will flee
the tongue / the rouffe of the mouth the throat / and the belly because they
touch the sacrament. But to hurt thy neghbure / or prevelye to convay away any
of his good / or not to help him in his need / is in a manner nether counted
for sin / nor yet regarded / But what needs me to rehearse any of these
abominations / since the hole world is replenisshed with his iniquite? What
mo^struous abominatio^s does not he with his adherentes bring to pass / which
are not only superstitious / But also de^sye in the head furious / and foles of
extreme madness.

Finally / through the authorite of the pope in a manner all the creatures of god
and all the use of them is made sin / for Christ would that in none of these
should be any sin another yet justice / the cause was parave^ture be cause he
only was holy. How be it it was co^venient for the most holy vicare of Christ
/ that he resistinge Christ should here multiplye and encreasse sins and
justices / and replenisshe the world (corruptinge the christen liberty and
suppressinge the faith) with folisshe / fearful / erromous and perisshinge
consciences. Behold now who is the man of sin and son of perdition. Nether
yet have I enumbered the thick swarm / and infinite host that depend on him
/ as cardinals / bisshoppes / prestes / monks / friars / nuns / decanes /
subdecanes / and other shavelinges which bost the^ silf fre from the law. For
these through their shavinges / vesturs / hours / and behaveours / abound with
as many sins / as the duns me^ with relatio^s / or thomistes with their
realites / and yet put they so many of them in every thing / as there are
creatures in the world / and consideracions in them. Good lord / All this
wretched multitude of men is nothing but sin / for he is counted a very
apostata and breker of his religion / which is not shaven / if he read not his
prescribed hours / if he be not clothed with a prestly color / if he were not
a hode or a coule / if he be not appareiled with purpull and silk / or else
change any of those things which are appointed him to do / who would not judge
a religious man to be an apostata / if he went in a lay man's aparell / or
would not be shaven in due time? But for to play the apostata and depart from
the faith is nothing regarded / In tra^sgressinge the high decrees the popes
own dispensationis scant counted enough / though it be redeemed with never so
much monye (all though for a little try full he will remitte any offense to
wards god / ye and sometime offer the remission for naught) So deep enters
the tyranny of his law in to our wretched consciences Therefore Daniel does
very well say / that he shall corrupt mervelous things / for what is it that
he leveth incorrupt? ye and so he does corrupt them that they can not be
repaired / for the consciences are so weaked and brought into bondage. In so
much that I am in doubt / if the pope would abrogate all his laws / whether yt
by those means this scrupulosite might he weded out of men's hearts / so that
their consciences might be heled / so cruel and incurable is this plage of the
people / which is sown among them (If I may use Esaias words) of this king
Assure. ^^e. x.


Here have thou the fruete of these faces and rydles / which is the corruption
/ of the church / of the faith / of Christ's liberty / of the sprete and
truth / and of all the goodness which are geven us of god / This is ye true
Antiochus in ye.viij. of Daniel / which there was named to be a figure / of
this kings faces / Danie. vij.
This is he which was exalted against the strength of heven / and did cast
done of the streght / and of the sterres / and did trede them under his feate
/ and prevailed until he came unto the prince of strength / and took of him a
great sacrifice (that is to say faith) And cast down his holy place (that is
me^nes consciences) he hade stre^ght geve^ him against ye great sacrifice
because of sin / and ye truth in the earth shall be felled and cast down / And
he shall prosper and do. Does not ye pope fulfill all these things avauncynge
his faces and ridles against ye truth and faith? Mark well what satan
speaks by their moutes / They say that all things were not set in a
perfayte order of Christ but were left to the judgment of the Chirch to be
ordered / sith Christ ordened that there should be no sin but vnbeleffe and no
justice but faith. As he says in the xvj. of Joan. he shall rebuke the world
of sin / because they beleve not in me / And again. He that beleveth not
shall be condemned / All things that are with out a man do not defile man but
are clean fre / except we offend against them with an evil concupiscence which
comes from with in. How be it the Pope defiles the hole world by these
outward things / and is nothing moved with the inward pollusio^s. Be hold how
plain Christ's words are / and yet we will not se this his adversary and
corrupter of the faith.

Besides these manners of sins and perditions / the pope has ordened other
tra^sgressions. first ye false trust of soch works / which is duble iniquite /
for they which obey ye pope in his precepts / and eschew soch things as ye
pope co^mawndeth / do think with high presumption (ye and also are counted
of other) yt they have done well and des^roed heve^. And this is ye other
pernicious instrument of corruption which rages through ye hole world / Be
cause ye with this trust and co^fide^ce ye faith of Christ ca^ not consist /
forthermore be cause they are so oppressed and lade with ye multitude of laws
/ yt they fulfill them only with ye outward work for their wills are clean
contrary and would resist them / As we se by experience in ye trobleous besines
/ of vigilles / masses / and hours which both must be said and song / In the
which they labor with soche weryenes / that now adays no labor is more
tedyous. Yet nevertheless the heddes masters and cruel exactores of these
most hard works compel us to work soch things with out ceassinge / which
before god are nothi^ge but grevous sins / all though before men they be good
works / and counted for the service of god / here are inve^ted thentismentes
of the senses through organes / music / and diversite of songs / but these are
nothing to the sprete / which rather is extincte through these wa^tan trifels
Ah Christ / with what violence / with what host and power are they driven
heddelinge to sin and perisshe / through ^his abomible abomination / It is an
^^^rible / tremblinge and fear to look in ^o these cruel whorlp oules of
consciences / which perisshe with soch great pains and labor. xi. Reg. xxi.
O what light and childisshe offenses are these / wherein Manasses and other
weked kings sinned by doing sacrifice with their own children and progenye.
Truly the cursed sacrifices of the most rude gentiles / no not of the
lestrigones / Ma^h. xij.
may be compared un to ours / The sayeinge of Christ may be verified in us
seven more weked spretes make the end worsse then the beginning / for I say
that we gentiles are worsse seven times the^ we were before we knew Christ.

And that we may be short concerning this corruption / and that thou maiste
perceave that there is nothing in ye pope but sin and perdition. Mark well /
not only his laws are synes / but also all the works that follow them (and not
those alone which are fained and done with werynes as I said before) ye and
the rewards are the greatest sins of all / So that the less sins are
rewarded with the greater. Thou will axe me how? I will tell the. They are not
content to bind and destroy Jesus but also they let go Barrabas the theffe /
that is to say / he does exempte through his privileges the hole multitude of
his clargye / from the burde^s and labors of all men / that they may lyve in
idelnes and riches / regardinge nothing to commit the abomination of Zodom
and Gomorrha. Nether is it lawful for any man to reprove / accuse or correct
them when they transgress. But only the pope / which nether will do it /
nether yet ca^ if he would. here spri^ge out of fat their iniquites. By these
means abound / defloueringe of virgins / advoutrye / fornication / uncleanness /
covetuousnes / soreltye / deceate / and the hole cloud of wekednes / ye and
not only abound / but also reign unpunished / with out fear of god or man.
And if any man rebuke or check the^ he is reputed a weked transgressor of ye
popes privileges / and is giltye for hurtinge his mageste. To this pertain the
most holy laws and decrees / de foro competenti. And all those in the which
the clergy is exempte from the accusation / judgment / and punishment of the
lay men: ye and their possessions. finally / this most holy adversarye of
Christ has made vsurye / sotiltye / and rape / lawful un to them / while that
he does admit to the encreasse of the honor and worshuppe of God / unjust
restoringes unlawful bargaynes / and despenseth graciously with pety bryebrye
/ geving thapostles benediction to be pertaker with them. As for the
abstayninge from matrimonye we have spoken of it bot / he how Satan was the
author that it was forbede / and what sins and perditions are entered / ye
and daily encreassed through the forbedinge of it.

Have we any end of this bottomless pit and hell? Were not only the oaths
where with he binds / bisshopes / prestes / monks / princes and vniversites
/ sufficient to make him the man of sin and son of perdition? For who is
able to recite the periuryes / sith there is in a manner no man that swereth
with his will / and yet is he compelled to swear / where as is no necessite of
the faith or of his neghburs profit / wherefore thou takist the name of god in
vain / for that which is not done with the affect and mind of the heart / is
done vaynly and with sin. So that this kingdom of faces has not only
prevayled to corrupt the faith / but also to destroy good manners. In so much
that he has left nothing. But it is attaynted and in a manner putrified. And
yet has he cloked and covered these cursed mo^stres with soch a fine and
beutyfull color of faces / and has so defended the^ against every power both
of virtue and wepon / that this king of faces was most mete to be the last
monstre in the end of the world / prepared against the great cominge of Christ
/ that Christ might show his great virtue and power / in the greatness of this
monstre / here speak I nothing of the infinite evilles by the which he
transgresses the.iiij.v.vij. and viij. commaundmentes / for he takes away
thobedience which the children owe to their parents / sturringe up and arminge
the sons against the fathers as it is seen en He^rie the.iiij. and many
other / Henry the iiij. emperor.
for he will that he be hard above / and before all other Also that he
replenissheth the world with blood and murder / making debate at his own
pleasure be twixte kings and princes / being the occasion of great wars and
co^tentions. So that a man may doubt / whether satan him silf (if he reigned
presently among us) might bring soch things to pass as the Pope does. Now
does this mighty these invade and subdew hole kingdo^s and dukedoms. And
devoreth bisshoprickes benefices / and all the goods movable and immovable in
ye hole world / through subsidyes bulls / and other infinite crafts very sotle
/ craftye and lyeinge / knittinge / and vnbindinge all things / according to
his pleasure. And this man of sin and son of perdition / conveyeth his
matters on that facyon / that he denies them to be sins / ye and affirms
that it is sin if any man resist or laughe at them. And that so abominable
sin that no hell is sufficient to punissh it. And he has drawn un to him in
to this weked mind and sentence (all though not the hole world) yet truly at
the lest the hole hepe of the clergy / and a great part of the lay people /
destroyng them that consent unto him perpetuallye / so that not by one manner
of way / but by all ways he corrupts and destroys all things / and may
well be called a corrupter of mervelous things.

The sacrament of the altar.
But let us proceed to the greatest and most abominable mischeffe of all other /
concerning the sacrament of the altar and baptime or repentance. First he
has taken from the chirch the holy misterye of the mass. And so has corrupt
it concerning the lay people that he has clean taken away the one part from
them / and not only takenie away / but also made it sin / ye and extreme
heresye if any man according to the ordenance of Christ use both the kinds. O
lyvinge and immortal god / what presumptuous boldness has this weked
abominatio^? If Christ had forbeden any of the kinds / he had been an heretic
yt had received both but now since he does not forbed it / and so ordeneth no
sin in the receavinge / but rather does orden both parts to be received /
his vica^e in a thing not forbed / but lawful and fre / ye and ordened of
Christ hi^silf / has made not only sin but also high heresye. Nether so is
Antichrist known / but is yet worshupped / as the vicare of God. O the
rowghnes of the wrath and furye of god Plainly I think that the hole is taken
away since I se manifestly on part gone (for the bred and the wine is but one
sacrament) the other is left only for a laughinge stock / for he that in one
part offends against god is giltye in all / except paraventure god by his
secreate judgment has reserved it in the faith / with out any outward
receavinge of the sacrament. Therefore it were better to rece^ve nether of the
parts then the one alone / for so we might the more suerly eschew the
tra^sgression of that which Christ did institute.

Yet he not satisfied with this his furye setting a most cruel and deadly
snare to tangle the consciences / suffers not the use of this sacrament to be
fre. But compels all to gedder on one certain day ons in the year to
communicate. Here I pray the good Christian brother / how many do thou think
do excommunicate only by the compulsion of this precept which truly in their
heart had lever not to communicate? And all these sin (for they do not
communicate in sprete / that is to say nether in faith nor will / but by the
compulsion of this letter and law) sith that this bred requires a hungery
heart / and not a full / and much less a disdayning and hateful mind. And of
all these sins the Pope is author constrayning all men by his most cruel
law to their own destruction / where as he ought to leve this communion fre
to every man / and only call and exhort them un to it / not co^pelle and dryve
them to it. Consider well / whether by this occasion the world be not
replenisshed with sins vpe to heve^. And with this floude enough destroyed.
So he does not only despoyle us of our sacrament / but also that which he
leveth us / he orders on that manner / that through the occasion of it he
fulfilleth the world with sin / and so brings us unto destruction.

How be it he does much more mock and illude the prestes for first he turns
the mass which is a sacrament and testament / to be reputed for a benefit and
good work by the which prestes should make sacrifice for sins / and should
help the qwicke and dead in all tribulations. Chalenging un to him filf by
this feigned lie all riches / glory / and powers of the world. So that now the
mass is clean unprofitable un to our health / and is only of value for luker
under this incredible perversite and ungodliness / forthermore they make a
sacrifice of it / By the which they do well and geve thanks unto God / as
though he had need of our goodness / of whom we receave all things / plainly
this weked perversite passes all sense and words / and yet has it beseaged /
ye and oppressed the hole world. Thierdly / he makes a private thing of a
comen / for the mass in both parts never ought to be suffered un to one man /
since that Christ would have it comen / so that the pressed executinge should
communicate both parts un to some congregation gadered un to him. How be it
now the pressed celebratinge does communicate only to him silf both parts. And
yet in the mean ceason he does communicate and apply spiritually, the fruere
of the mass un to who^ so ever he will (that is to say he dreameth yt he does
communicate some thing) as though it were a good work and sacrifice. And so
where it ought to be received come^lye / he only does receave it / and yet not
as the gift of god to possess it / but as his own gift to offer it. O what
profund sees of sins / abound in this one sacrament. Good lord / how few /
or rather none are there which use it lawfullye as Christ did orden it / and as
his apostles kept it.

Auriculare confession.
The same and like madness does corrupt all things in the auriculare confession
of our sins / for first / since this confession is a thing very holesume /
it ought to be fre for our new law (which is the gospel) will not suffer any
law of compulsion / but only of council and exhortation. But so many sins
does the Pope make / and so many souls does he condeme / as are confessed
against their wills how often so ever it be / for when they confess through
the compulsion of the Popes law their mind resists his law. And so do they
sin / belevinge in their weke and wretched conscience that they are bound of
necessite to confess them selves / and yet confess they against their wills
/ and knowledge their sins with their mouths and not with their hearts / that
is to say faynedly. And so offend grevouslye. Now consider substantiallye what
surges and waves the Pope has excitate in the world by this one law of
compelled confession. How many is there yt with a glad and fre heart confess
them selves? Yet no man does think yt this is sin / in so much ye all men
perissh or they beware through this same son of perdition and abominable man
of sin.

And to thentent that this profoundite of sins and perditions should be
greatter / he compels also that the offenses which are committed against his
law should be confessed / ye and that chefly of all / with all the differences
of sins / kinds / natures / daughters / nesys / branches / circunstances /
and infinite other abominations / in so much yt the most spiritual man of all
/ should here begyne to sin and perisshe / that is to say confess against his
will / for this sentence sto^deth firm and stable / he that does a thing
against his will does it not. And again. Compelled servises please not god.
Since the^ the Pope has no need of these laws / but only to stablissh and
encreasse his tyranny it is evident that he is the author of infinite sins
and infinite perditio^s / while that by his laws / he geveth a great occasion
of evil to weak and froward consciences / which think them self to be bound
un to the fulfilling of his laws / for if a man beleve yt he is bound / and
does not fulfill that which he thinks him silf bound to with heart and mi^de
/ he does sin with out c^asinge as Paul says in the.xiiij. Roma. xiiij.
to the Romans he that makes conscience is damned if he eat / for what so
ever is not of faith the same is sin. But this beleve ye pope requires in
his laws / and yet ca^ he not geve the mind to do it. And truly so little
necessite and authorite has he to exact it / as he has power to geve the
mind to fulfill it. So that there is no e^use but even / his pure pleasure
which replenischeth the world with these sins and perditio^s / and devoreth
ye Christen / ij. Petri. ii.
as Peter does say / they which were clean escaped / of them are again
wropped in erroures. therefore Christ would not call him abominable / But the
very abominatio^ it silf. And Paul entending to publish his mischeff called
it not the sin of the man / and perdition of the son / ij. The. ij.
but called him the very man of sin / and weked son of perdition /
signifyinge yt there was nothing of value in him but all sin and perdition.
And truly this we se fulfilled in the pope / Insomoch yt except Christ do
shorte^ these days no flesh should be faved / And who knows whether that
these days which were spoken of to be shortened pertayne unto the infantes
which dye before the time / that they know this weked abomination?

Satisfaction.
The laws also of satisfactions (o Christ our savior) how many souls do they
destroy. Who ca^ attain to know these passions / vexatio^s / and deaths of
consciences? For first of all (in publisshi^ge his laws) he does not only
take away our liberty in this thing / but also makes a conscience to every
man to make satisfaction / which thing sith no man does it freely / he is
compelled (through this weked law and erroneous conscience agreing in one) to
sin with out ceasinge. Yet does he not prescribe in his laws / how much the
satisfaction shall be / As he determeth of ye sacrament of ye altar / and of
confession, but even as his lyeing heart geveth him / and as his vain pleasure
is / thou shall satisfye / geve / and suffer so much / as he and bis adhere^tes
will / or lack monye. And so satan does here spote and and play him / in
vexing our co^scie^ces / to acco^plisshe all his malice Here does he challenge
ye victories of martyrs / And fights with ye sede of the^ which cast hi^ out
of heve^ / havinge a great wrath / as we may se in ye apocalipsis. And so does
heswage and pacyfye his wrath / yt he sporteth and lawgheth in our perditio^s /
as it were in a most vile thing / and of no reputation / Oh we wretches that
thus sleep and rought / out of ceason. If so be ye pope would suffer all these
things fre / not snaringe our co^scie^ces / the^ should he work no sin and
perdition. How be it / it would turn in to ye destruction of his facye kingdom
/ therefore it were better yt ye hole word should perissh / then his kingdom
should decay / So thou may se / how that Christ is the author of justice /
Never ordeninge / law sin and perdition / but rather calling and
deliveringe us from the laws and constitutions / And contrary how the pope is
author of sin / in every thing making laws / corruptinge justice and
health / Drivinge and constrayninge all men to be subdewed under his laws / he
is not called holy / but most holy / Not the minister of Christ but his
vicare. Not the equalle fellow and companion / but prince of prelates / And head
of all shepardes / woo be to the. It follows.

^^ie. viij.
And he shall prospere and do.
That is through his faces and rydles / sith there is nothing of more
efficacite and might to deceave and destroy then the cloak of godliness /
chefly of all since it is avaunsed under ye name of god / Nether yet so should he
have profited except he had been help with the operations of satan / after
that god for the abundance of sin had forsaken the world. For what natural
reason does not perceave what folyssh and weked things the Pope many times
does command and do / ye with out any cloak. And yet these things have so
prevayled / that hole grecye has resisted him in vain. How many times also
have the emperors of germanye? how often have other kings / how often have
many bisshoppes? how often have many good and well learned men resisted this
monstre? how be it / they are all overcome / suppressed / and extincte / The
operation of error has prevayled / and they are so swollen with presumptuous
pride / yt they may boldly bost that they are to be feared / as though Christ
him silf did work with the^ defendinge his Chirch. These things are well
known to the^ that have read the stories / in the which they are so plainly
perceaved / that the stories of italye / which corrupt al things to flatter
and avaunce the popes highness / could not cloak and keep secret much of his
mischeffe / So ye tenore of his acts which were wropped and involved under so
many colors and clokes of lies / and covered by the disgysinge and flaterye of
parasites / does at ye length put forth his abomination / and revelate their
author / to his great rebuke and sclaunder (be these flaterers never so much
against it) Plainly declaringe that the popes have resisted and fought against
the gospel / Nether do these wretched parasites obtain any thing through
their lies / but that the pope for his chirch (which is his tyranny) has
manfully / fought / despoyled ravisshed / killed / and replenisshed the world
with murder / blod / and other miserye / And how these things differ from the
gospel (how so ever they please the blondes / platines / and soch like) he is
a very stock yt understands not / be he never so rude. For peace and the
ministerye of peace / the care and regard of spiritual things and that with
all affection and desire / pertayneth unto the pope / But thistoriographes of
Italye praise ye popes be cause they have vexed imperyes / kingdoms /
bisshoprikes / and dukedoms / and have schratched them to them selves through
violence and deceate / as though they were due un to them by right. Therefore he
has prevailed and prospered in all his wills being a lewed adversary of god.
And so has done and fulfilled / that which he has desyered all men resistinge
him in vain / both godly and ungodly / holy and profane / rude and learned /
and that is fulfilled which follows.

Danie. viij.
And he shall corrupt strong things and the people which are hoyle.
The same thing does Daniel in ye.viij. prophesye upon Antiochus which was the
figure of ye pope. Danie. viij.
And he did cast down the sterres of heve^ and did trede the^ under his
feate. And Christ in ye.xxiiij. of Matthew does prophesye / Mat. xxiiij.
yt the very chosen shall be brought in to error. And Paul says that there
shall cume strong delusion. ij. These. ij.


Truly if I should follow mine own mind and take the hebrew words in that sense
to expound / for strong men / stre^gthes. And for the holy people /
thapostles and evangelists whereto the words do also incline / the^ should the
sense be / that the pope should be soch one that should corrupt / destroy and
suppress / ye holy scripturs (which are the only strength of the chirch) and
the holy people that is to say thappostles and evangelistes / be cause he
will be taken and helden with no authorite of scripture / but wresteth /
despoyleth / corrupts / and destroys (which is very true) all scriptures at
his own pleasure. If we take it / in this sense / the^ follows the next verse
mervelous accordingly and to the purposse. For this is the cause that he will
not be subdued vnderscripture / and brought in to a good order / for he would
that all things should be done / said / taught / understand / and expounded /
after his own will and mind This purposse to obtain he corrupts in a manner
all things / vainlye and presumptuously expounds them / rather then he will
geve place to a another man's judgment (though it be truee) or else seem to
have erred and done amysse. And this may be declared by many examples in his
decrees where as in every place he does corrupt the sainges of scripture / of
Christ and his Apostles according to that which now follows.

And he shall be after his own opinion. Danie. viij.

The hebrew says / ve al sichlo / which signifies. And after his own mi^d /
vndersto^dinge the verb shall be / or shall do / or soch like. Here is the
prerogative of ye popes kingdom touched / whereby the pope is elevated above all
other / and is declared to be subject to no man's judgment. For he will
judge every man / and will be judged of no man as the weked papists do crake
with a loud and schrile voice / that the thrones and courts of them that must
geve judgment / must of this sete receave their se^te^ce / Grou^dinge him upon
this he runs ryote in his decrees like a mad man that the inferior sete
shall not judge the superior. To this intent pertayneth the chapter Cuncta per
mundu^ nouit ecclesia / Where in it is determed that it is not lawful to judge
of the sentence of the chirch of Rome. I pray the what may be spoken or hard
more abominable / the^ this blasphemous and wretched voice. This is it that
Peter does speak of in the.ij. of. ye.ij. epistle / ij. Petri. ij
Presu^ptuous they are and stondinge well in their own conceate. Is not this
an incredible presumption that one weked and wretched man / which is oppressed
with all iniquite and mischeff / most rude and unlearned / should take upon him
to be judged of no man / to err in nothing / to judge all men? This is it
that they meaned / when they did reach with most cursed blasphemye that the
pope was above the counsel. And that it belongs only to him to expound the
scripturs / and that his judgment must be preferred above the hole
congregation. Nether have they so much brain as to judge that the congregation
(ye and every faithful in Christ) has ye holy ghost / to whose judgment the
very angels ought to obey / and much more this weked and unlearned man / which
is compased about and instruct only with soch as he is him silf.

And this is it that again Peter does prophesye of in the.iij. of the second
epistle saying yt there should come certain / i. Petri. iij.
which should walk after their own lusts / what signifies that to walk after
their own lusts. But even as Daniel does say that all thing shall be done of
this king after his own sense / opinion and will? for sichel in the hebrew
does signifye the mind / sense / opinion will / and desire of the flesch /
which in the greek tongue is called nous and pronoia / as in the.viij. to the
Romans. They that are carnal are carnally minded / and again / The desire of
ye flesch is death. This desire this mind and opinion (as they call it) does
Daniel touch. Which we se so vehement in the pope that (despisinge scripture)
he dare presume of his own brain / to pronounce and diffine / only puttinge
his confidence in the greatness of his tyranny / out of this springs it /
that he calls him silf the chirch / and suffers no iudgeme^te. But to be
laboreth ye master / teacher / and head of all chirches / making hi^ silf the
rule of ye faith being far from it and unfaithful him silf / and yet this
weked man is praised in his desires. Behold now what it means to do all
things after his own mind. Can there any thing be thought more abominable /
then that the chirch which lives and is led with the holy ghost / should geve
place in expoundinge the sense of scripture to wretched / weked and unlearned
men / which presume only upon the violence of their tyranny? And yet is this
bosted now adays for a high article of the faith. Nether is there any
heretic counted more pernyciouse / then he which but with a beck does seame
to doubt in this one point. Truly the kingdom of Satan / is now come to an
end / for while this folish fellow goth about so curiously to confirm his
impery and make men obey it. It chances in the mean ceason by the high
provision of God / that he betrayeth him silf like a shrewd and unfaithful
patron. And through no another means / but by his diligent labor and curiosite
while he sets great hereses in trifelinge matters / and holds his peace
patiently if a man would deney god utterly / or were endewed with all iniquite /
as we may se in the bisshopes / for if they were led with the sprete of god /
they would first and most of all seake those things which partaine to God. Now
because they seake their own profit nothing regardinge that which pertains
to god / it appears plain enough with what sprete they are carried.

Wherefore it is necessary that Paul in the.xiiij. of the first epistle to the
Corinthia^s be suppressed and destroyed by this king of faces and rydles /
which will do all things after his own mind / and admit nothing to the
judgment of scripture / for he says if any revelation be made to a another yt
sits by let the first hold his peace / i. Corin. xiiii.
and again. Let the prophets speak.ij. atonce or three atonce / and let other
judge. What says the Pope? There is nothing (he says) revelate to any that
sits / but I alone shall speak first / let the other hear. And again /
let not the other judge / but I will prophesye and other shall be judged. for I
am the master / the prophet / and the vicare of God. It belongs unto us to
speak / or else as it is said in the.xj. Psalm. We shall exalt our tongue /
our lips be our own / Psalm. xj.
who is our lord? And so does this weked / more presumptuous then proud
Pelagius / avaunce him silf in his decrees / saying. Where as is the maiorite
/ there is the authorite of commau^dinge / as for the other of necessite must
obey. Tell me if thou canste whether any of the kings which ever have been sith
the beginning of the world / have commanded and exacted their laws with soch
pride swellinge / arrogancye / boldness / stubbornes / standi^ge so well in
their own conecate / with soch imperious a voice / folisshe hardenes / and
presumption / as only this one Pope? Truly god him silf did never exact his
precepts with soch imperious mageste and power. Is he not therefore a worthy
successor of Peter which taught in the.v. of his first epistle. i. Petri. v.
Submit your selves every man / one to a another / what means that but to
geve place one to the other / and not to be stubborn in his own opinion? And
Paul in the xij. to the Romans says. Make your self equal to the^ of the
lower sort / Roma. xij.
be not wysse in your own opinions. And Solomon. Put a measure in thy
wisdom. And again stick not to thine own wisdom. And paul did write
cheflye to the Romans when he exhorted them not to be wise in their own
opinions. Even as Peter did also when he prophesied yt there should come
stubborn me^ which should stond well in their own co^ceat and walk after
their own lusts.

Nether yet only in judging does he follow his own opinion / but also in
teachinge and livinge / behold the hole face of the chirch / and show me if
thou can / in what profession / sect or part / they live according to he
precepts of God / do they not teach y^^ and live / Collo. ij.
after chosen holiness (as the apostle calls it) Doing soch things as they
think them silf holy and right / as though there were no king in Israel / as
it is said in the.xxj. of iudicum. And the Pope does praise and confirm all
these things / Iudic. xxj^
all be it the law in ye.xij. Deutero. xij.
of the Deuteronomye does instantly and sharply forbed those propre opinions.
And in the.iiij. of Amos. Amos. iiij.
Sacrifice you of leven / praise / and call un to you / and show your wilful
oblations / for this has been your desire you children of Israel. And paul
does reprove ye inventors and finders of new things / how be it this
detestable folisshe hardenes of our / own mind and opinion is utterly
condemned by the most godly example of Iosue / where as after the sprete had
exhorted him and faithfully promised him that he should pass over Iordane / yet
would he not that he should be directed and ordered by his awn^ opinion / but by
the judgment of scripture ^aynge in the first chapter. Be of good comfort /
and very strong that thou may keep and do all my law / which Moses my

truly they can not be known what they are if they be done after our own
opinion with out ye law of god / for we know not whethere they pleace God or
nay / we beat the air with our fiste / and labor with out certaynte / ye

blissed is he therefore which has not walked in the council of ungodly men.

How be it our Pope does so glory and rejoice in his own opinions /
despising the law of God / that he does avaunce him silf to be the chirch /
and incredible council. Nether does he consider that this Iosue had no less
of the sprete of God then any Pope ever had. And yet will the sprete that
nothing should be done of him / which was not expressly rehearsed in the
scripture. In so much that much more the Chirch ought not to be of his own
opinion / but rather to stick and lene to the judgment of god and testimonies
of scripture. O thou Pope.

How be it the stubborn fellow that sto^deth over much in his own conceat /
will mock and think sone to dissolve this reasone / puttinge a difference
with a fained distinction and most craftye illusion to escape fre / betwext
jurisdiction and charity / affirminge that the forsaide textes of scripture
should be understand of the office of charity / not of the tyranny of
jurisdiction (which is the high hierarchye and impery of the chirch) clean
ignorant that jurisdiction in the chirch is nothing else / but the
administration of charity / seperatinge by weked / and folissh hardenes / the
office which is ministered in the chirch from charity / suffillinge that which
follows.

Danie. viij.
And deceate shall be directed and prospere in his hand.
For this cause cheflye do the purposses of Antichrist prosperously prevayle /
be cause he him silf has deceaved the chosen children of god. As Christ says.
There shall arise false christen and false prophets / Math. xxiiij
and shall geve great signs and wonders. So greatly that if it were possible /
even the chosen should be brought in to error. And here does he monissh us
that the elect shall not be brought in to error (all though they be deceaved)
that is to say that error shall not utterly subdew them / and hold them
perpeally / but that at the lest in death they shall be redeemed. Like as in the
pater noster it is not the will of god that we should not be tempted with
diverse temptations / but that we-shall not be brought in to temptations / that
is to say that we should not be overcome / and holden perpetually under
temptation / for the righteous man falls.vij. times / how be it he lies not
still / but ryseth as often again. Even so I doubt not but that sanct Barnarde
/ Francisce / Dominike and many other holy men and women have erred as
concerning the Pope not perceaving his kingdom of faces / and so approvinge
many of his acts / or else they would have resisted them with the word of God /
how be it his time was not then come. In this number I count also Bonave^ture
which passes all other with out comparison (in the veheme^cye of sprete) which
have been reserved of all vniversites. Among these may be numbered saint Thomas
aquinas / if he be a sa^cte / for truly I doubt of it greatly / because he
savoreth nothi^ge of the sprete of god. I say all these holy men have been
deceaved / folowinge the abominatio^ of the pope / how be it / it was with out
pertinacite and stubbornness / and were delivered from it / at the lest in
death. Therefore if he deceave and corrupt the chosen / all though he can not
retain the^ in his pernicyous illusion / what shall we think is done of the
other which are not only deceaved / but also stobbornlye defend their error
for godliness? O what a weak argument is this which the papists do gether of
the deeds and works of holy me^. Sotinge after their old manner / sith that
Daniell does prophesye that he shall corrupt strong men / and the people
which are holy / he speaks not of fained saints / for Christ expoundinge
him calls the^ the chosen. Therefore we must put confidence in no man vsinge
an example of the holy me^ / but only stick to the suer testimony of
scripture / and un to the truth / he has destroyed Joan husse / and Hierome /
and I can not tell what other / but I know not whether I may refarre that unto
this place / be cause he destroyed only their bodies and not their souls / for
I think he speaks here of spiritual corruption.

And how should not painted visars / clokes faces / and other deceatfull
illusions (as Paul says) and hypocrisye of his own traditions / rather
prospere in his hand then the truth of ye gospel / since he corruptinge the
strength of ye scripture / and of all ye good authors of it / is only
stablisshed by ye example of a few sanctes sto^dinge on his side? what may not
he prosperously bring to pass / since yt now not only his faces and rydles /
ye is to say his deceates / but also they whom thou knowledgest to be sanctes
make for his purposse? who dare here once qwinch / against him / since yt his
lyeinge cloak is help with ye truth / his hypocrisye with holiness / his
deceat with simplicite / And his iniquite with godliness? O this parilous times
/ most worthy for the last days / where as to the reprobate parsons all
things are turned in to evil / ye though they seame never so good As
contrary to the chosen all things work for the best / though they seame
never so evil / and this is done through the sprete of god / even as the first
is done through ye spret of Satan as the apostle prophesyed. Let him now go
(that dare) and live with out any regard trustinge in the sainges and deades of
his forfathers / No doubt / here Daniell means Satan / when he says that
deceate shall prospere in this kings hand / for he is not mighty in his own
power / Nether shall his own hand order and direct his deceate / but Satan
shall led his hand and so shall deceate be directed in his hand. How could he
better have described the kingdom and works of the pope? which is nothing
but very deceate and yet prevails so prosperously / that even with open lies
and tryfels he blinds and deceaveth the folissh world / as it is evident
enough though it were but only in the pardons / for what so ever the Pope dare
take upon him / be it never so abominable a lie / it prospers effectuously.

Therefore the deceate which is in his hand does chefly pertayne unto the
corruptinge of the scripture / for here he has cast down the sterres of heven
/ and trod them under his feate / and in his deceate how fortune has favored
him / experience does plainly bear wittnes. For what so ever he would have /
that spoke he in expoundinge scripture. And what so ever he said in his
exposition / that was counted for an oracle of god / and so is reputed unto
this day. In so much that it is not lawful nether with reasons / nether with
scriptures / another yet with manifest experiences to affirm any thing against
it / on till it have taken away the comen sense of man's nature from all men
/ and has attemted soch things / which if the gentiles in ye old time should
ever have done / me^ would have said that they had been stark mad. Now after
that all these things did prosper luckely with him / so that nether faith /
nether the sprete / nether yet the authorite of the scripture might resist him
the^ what remained but that which follows.

^anie. viij.
And in his own heart he shall be exalted.
For there is no man but now ye pope prefers him silf above him / There is
no man but he dare be bold to command him all things / he will subdewe all
things underneath him silf. Sca^t admitti^ge high emperors and kings to the
kiss of his blessed feate Nether is there any man whom he will have equal with
him in the earth be he never so holy and well learned. Finally he being no
apostle but a very bisshoppe (if he be that) fare under the dignite of the
apostles / makes him silf equal with sanct Peter. The prince of all men. The
emperor in all spiritual (as they call them) and temporal things. The lord
of the world. For in Peter he will that he has received the right and
authorite / of the erthly and hevenly emperye. And that do his.iij. crowns /
pride / and wa^tonnesse / testifye which pass all the vain presumptions in
the world. Thus does the vicare of poor Christ / and successor of Peter /
present their parsons and images. For he depresseth and puts down / kings
/ princes / and bisshoppes / and every power in the world / for his pure
pleasure / more exalted / ye and made more wordly then the world it silf. And
of this thing we have spoken sufficiently a fore expoundinge the mind of Peter
and Judas which prophesyed that he should despise and speak evil of gloryes
and powers / Snatchinge and subdueing unto him silf the goods and possessions
/ of all men. For if he would be constrained and holden by scripture /
declininge some deall from his own mind and opinion Not violatinge and
corruptinge scripture by his deceatfull interpretation / he might some what be
with drawn from the presu^ption and high pride of his heart / And so might be
called again to the administration of the gospel / and to the tuition (as his
duetye is) of the poor. How be it ye scripture must needs be fulfilled that he
should have rule of all / and should be exalted in his own opinion above all the
things of the world. It was not for naught that Daniel said / yt he shall be
exalted in his own heart / for he is not so elevated before god / or in the
will of god. But in his own heart / in his own opinion / through his own
folissh hardenes / by deceates / faces / rydles / and other strong illusions.

Another yet is this weked abomination co^te^ted to rule the highest of all and
greatest in the earth (as he is called ye highest and greatest Bisshope) but he
has begone also to extend his hands and power in to purgatory. And has also
presumed to command angels / and to sit and reign in every man's
conscience. So that there should be nothing / but that the great presumption of
his heart should be bold to invade it. This incredible abomination plainly
passes all men's capacite. It follows

Danie. viij.
And in this luckye prosperity he shall corrupt very many
He calls this prosperity / the abounda^ce of all things. For after that the
word / the faith and the scripture are trodden under his feate. And all mennnes
possessions subdued unto him / truly he must needs abou^d with all things.
For who has soch abounda^ce of riches / soch pleasures / soch honors as the
pope and his sect or adhere^tes? Are not all the cheffe and best things in
the world theyrs? And do they not possess the^ most quietly? Do they not use
them most at their pleasure in to all pomp / wantonness / pride? and what shall
I say? If the hole world be compared to the popes imperye / it should seame but
vile / and truly should not appear to be the world. For what should he do else
(sith he is another subject to the word another yet regards the scripture) but
command and expound all things / after his own pleasure and opinion? Who
they are / yt this prosperity does corrupt and destroy / I had lever commit
it to other men's judgment / then to diffine it my silf. For the Cardinals
/ bisshoppes / monks / and hole multitude of prestes / what are they else / but
the people of the pope which are destroyed / with idelnes / riches / bankettes
/ wa^tonnes / lust / and vncarefulnes. Corruptinge this bodily liff / with out
end / with out the word / with out scripture / with out labor / and with out
any care? These truly does this noble king of faces norissh and encreasse in
his orders / making them by his deceates and lies / of spiritual and
faithful seven times carnal and wordly / which walk under the cloak of
godliness and religion.

It follows.

And he shall resist the prince of princes. Danie. viij.

This is the su^me of the hole / that he shall resist Christ / and suppress his
word / exaltinge his own word in the stead of Christ's / as thapostle does
say / he shall sit in the temple of god showing him silf as though he were god.
And again / which is an adversarye and is exalted above all that is called god
or ye is worshupped. To this place pertayneth it that the pope did condemn
the truth of the word of god openly at constantie In Joan husse / perseveringe
un to this present day in the same stubbornnes / of contrarying and
co^dempninge the word of Christ / for he can not withsto^d / the person of
Christ / but he shall withstond that is to say diffine things conttarie to
Christ / And this is his end. For. when he hade suppressed the word / and
corrupted ye faith / despoilinge the scripture / and the doctrine of the
apostles / Exaltinge him silf above the angels and commanding them. there was
nothing remayninge / but that he made gross / and well stuffing his belie /
should also rise against his lord and god, and hyer he would presume if there were
any thing hyer. But since there is nothing hyer the^ god / It is necessary
that this abomination here stick and remain still / that he may receave his
end / as it follows.

^anie. viij.
And he shall be consumed with out hand.
So says also thapostle / ij. These.
whom the lord Jesus shall consume with the sprete of his mouth / and shall
destroy with the apperance of his coming. Therefore the lay people shall not
destroy the pope and his kingdom / al though the wretches be fore a ferd of it
(for they are unworthy this mild stroke and punisshment) but they art reserved
unto the cominge of Christ whose extreme and cruel ennimyes they be and long
have continewed for so should he perissh which exalts himsilf and ryseth
against all things / Noth wtth man's hand / but with the contrary sprete /
so that one sprete may destroy an other / and that the truth may revelate ye
deceate / which revelation is a very destruction. For the revelation of a lie
does utterly destroy it / Let us therefore pray that god and the father of our
lord Jesus Christ at the length may come again and visitte us in his glorious
power and mageste / And that he may show the joyful day / and coming in
glory of his son whom he has promised / so that this weked man of sin /
and son of perdition may be destroyed / that the operations of errors through
Satan may be finisshed / by the which (alas) every minette many thousand
souls are corrupt and cast hedli^ge in to hell / onley through ye presumptuous
powers of this abomination / and tyranny of the sete of Rome. Let all men say
Amen. AMEN.

Here ends the Revelation of Antichriste / which (although it be some deal
ferse against the pope and his adherentes) yet good christian brother read it
cheritably. move not thy patience. Overcome the^ rather with thy good and
virtuous lyvi^ge the^ with force and extert or power. So shall thou be the true
sone of thy father which is in heve^ / to who^ only be all glory. Ame^.

Antithesis,
WE have annexed (Christen Reader) unto the end of the Revelation / a little
tretyse after the manner of an Epitome and short rehersall of all things that
are examined, more diligently in the aforsayd book / wherein their false and
cloked hypocrisye is abundantly opened / by the co^payringe of Christ's acts
and theirs togedder / Mathe. vij
for Christ's rule can not be deceavable / which says yt we should know thy by
their works / ij. Corin. xj
for Paul says that soch false Apostles are weked workers which be
tra^sfigured in ^o christ's apostles. And no mervell for satan him silf / is
sometime tra^sfigured in to an angel of light / therefore it is no great thing
/ if yt his ministres do take upon / them a similitude / as though they were ye
ministres of justice / whose end shall be according to their works. Christian
men should mark soch and fly away from them for soch serve not christ but
their own belyes. And by sweet preachinges / and flateri^ge words deceave the
hertes of the innoce^tes. And eve^ as Ia^nes and Iambres withstode Moses / eve^
so these resist the truth / ij. Timo. iij. Exod^ viij
me^ they are of corrupt minds / and lewead as concerning the faith / but
they shall prevail no longer / for their madness shall be uttered unto all men as
theirs was. Thus the people be blinded fallinge in to vnbelesse. And are
deceaved through the sleghtye co^veyance of Antichrist and his adherentes. Sanct
Joan said that there were many antichrists in his time no wonder if now be
moo / Ioannis. iiij.
how be it by their works they shall be known / and also by their words / for
they shall contrary Christ both in liffe and learning / whom they profess to

The Pope and Bushopes have feigned penance / and command men to fast bred and
water / to go barefote / with out a sherte / and to offer to certain idolles
monye or catell / some masses must be song for the^ be cause their confessors
should have some profit / Some must go about the chirch / and chirch yard /
with a taper borninge in his hand. And ever some be punisshed by the purse /
though they offend not.

Christ sent to preach seventye and and two disciples / which promised freely
heven to them that would beleve in the name of Christ.

The pope and Busshoppes send aboule.iiij. sects of beggars to geve pardon
under their master Antichrist. And to sell heven to whom so ever they list /
the Apostles knew no soch things.

xl. Christ was buried in a garden in a poor monument with / out any funeral
pomp. Joan. xix.


The Pope and Busshopes are buried in tombs well gilt with many a torch and
great sole^nyte / with Angels gloriouslye portered that here their souls to
heve^. Not withstondinge it is to be feared that they go to supper with the
devil.

xli. Christ says if thou will be perfect go and sell all thye goods and
gev^^^ unto the poor for then shall thou have a (...) in heven. Math. xix.


The Pope says if thou will be perfect geve me thy money and I will geve the a
pardone that shall absoile the clean a pena et culpa I will for thy monye geve
the / ye kaye of heven gates.

Luce. xxii
xlij. Christ said unto his Apostles ye kings and princes of the gentles have
ruell and power our them / but you shall not so have.

The Pope says all emperors / kings and lords be my subjects / This is
daily read in his bulls / wherein he commands the nobilite / like as a
master does his servant.

Mat. xxiij Marci. ix
xliij Christ says he that among you will be greatest / let him be all your

The Pope says / The emperor must swear / and oath unto me as unto his lord

Matthew. xv.

silf. ca. Siomnes. distinct. xix.

Joan. xiilj.
xlv. Christ says I am the way and ye truth follow me in my learning And
rule you by the scripture for that shall be your judge.

what so ever I will. did. xix. cap. Si romanorum.

xlvi. Christ says he that beleveth and is baptized / he shall be saved / but
he that believes not shall be damned. Marci. xi


The Pope says he that geveth much money for my pardon shall be absoyled a pena
and a culpa. And then must he neades be saved / And he ye teaches otherwise is
an heretic / this testifies his bulls and pardons.

xlvij. Christ promisseth forgyvnes of sin. Matthew. iiij
And the kingdom of heven unto them that repent and will amend their lyves.

The Pope says / that no man can be saved except he be first shreve^ of
his prestes and friars / for they bring in money. ca. omnes.

xlviij. Christ says you shall love your ennimyes / and shall do good unto
them that hate you. Math. v


The Pope says they yt be ennimyes / to me and my cardinals / be cursed
with the great excommunication / and can not be absoyled with out much monye /
this is evident enough.

xlix. Christ commanded his disciples not to resist evil / but if a man
strife them on the one cheke / that they should offer him the other also.

The Pope says we may avenge and dryve away force with force. Desen. exco.

Peter put up thy sword in to the shethe / for he that strikes with sword
shall perissh with sword.

The Pope says / you Emperors / Kings / Princes / and Lords / take swerdes

will not obey my tyranny. This must an Emperor do or else he must be
perjured. After this manner has Julius the Pope slain.xvj. thowsande men in
one day / was not that well pastored? Did not he well nouressh the sheep which
Christ did commit unto his tuition?

liiij Christ said. Math. xxvj
Drink you all of this cup for this is the blood of my promise.

The Pope says I will not grant this for my prestes alone shall drink of
it (be cause it may cry avengeaunce on them alone) ye other shall not drink
of it in the pain of heresye.

lv. Christ says, Joan. xv

The Pope says all monks / friars / and nonnes shall vow and swear chastity
be it geven them or not / my prestes also shall not be wedded / but as for to
keep hores and ravyssh other men's / daughters and wyves / shall be despensed
with all. I will se no soch things / for my Bisshopes have yearly great monye
by it like as bawdes be wont to have.

Math. xv. Roma. xiiii Collo. ii Titum. j
lvij. Christ says all meats that man takes with thanks staineth not the
soul / for all things are pure to them that are pure.

The Pope says he that eats / eggs / butyr / or flessh in these days that
I have commanded to be fasted / does not only stain his soul with sin /
but also is to be denounced an heretic. Did. iiij. ca. Statuimus. this
agrees with christ even as the light does with the darkness. And yet have we
been thus blinded long / that we could never perceave this Antichrist till now
in the last days.

lviij. Christ said unto his disciples / that you bind in earth shall be bound
in heven / and that you lose in earth shall be losed in heven. Math. xvi Math.

The Pope chalengeth greater authorite for he will lose souls out of
purgatory / and command the angels to fetch them out and all for monye /
with out monye you get nothing /

lix Christ says when you have done all things that I have commanded you
yet faye that you are unprofitable servantes. Luce. xvij


The Pope says do those things that I command the / and take a sure
conscience unto the that thou art a just and a religiouse man / and that thou
have deserved heve^ And as for I my silf. Oh ab^mination.
If I do wrong in everye thing / and bring many thousands with me in to

lx Christ teached us to fulfille the works of mercy to the poor / ever
co^mendinge mercy above offeringes and sacrifice. Math. xxvi. Osee. vj Math. ix


The Pope teaches us to geve our monye for pardons / masses / direges / to
images and chirches / so that we may offer unto their be lies. And he that
says it is better to geve our cherite to the poor (as Christ says) is
counted half an heretic / be cause he goth about to mar the Popes markette.

Roma. iiij Joan. xi
lxj. Christ suffered death for our sins and arose for our justification /
or else we all should have perisshed.

The Pope says if thou bye my pardon / or else be buried in a graye friars
cote thou must needs be saved / so yt Christ has suffered in vayn / sith a
friars cote will save a man.

lxij. Christ only is our mediator which makes unite be twixte his father and
us / how be it the prayer of a just man is very good and profitable. Iacobi. v


The Pope says. The greatest power and salvation next to christ is mine.
Did. lx. ca. Si papa. I mervell then why he is so curious to cause us worshupe
the sanctes that are a sleep. And not rather him silf / sith he chale^geth a
greater power then ever they did while they lyved.

Math. v
lxiij Christ says / who so ever break one of my list commandments / shall
be called the lest (that is to say none) in the kingdom of heven.

The Pope says / what pertains his law unto me. I am subject to no laws.
xxv. q. i. ca. Omnia. therefore does the Pope but seldom right. And is all
ways against right ye and against his own laws / as often as men do bring
him money / for that loves he above all things.

lxiiij. Christ's law is suffilled through charity. Roma. xiij


The Popes law is fulfilled by money / if thou have no monye to geve them / thou
shall carye a fagott / though thou offend not / monye them and they se the not
/ do what thou will.

lxv. Christ is the head of the church as ye apostle does testifye. Ephe. i
Collo. j j. Corin. x
And also the stone whereon the chirch is bilded. And this chirch is the
congregation of the faithful and the very body of christ.

The Pope says I am the head of ye chirch. Did. xix. ca. Enim vero. And the
sete of Rome is the stone whereon the chirch is bilded. Dis. xix. Ita dominus.
Can any thing be more contrary unto the honor and glory of god / then thus
to despoyle him of his kingdom / which he so dearlye has bought shedinge his
precious blood for it? ij. Petri. ij ii. Timo iij


lxvj. Christ's law which is the holy scripture came by the enspiringe of the
holy ghost which did enfuse it aboundantlye in to the hertes of the apostles /
and of the same sprete has it his endewrance and interpretation.

The Pope says I am lord of ye scripture to allow and disalowe it / for of
me does it take his full authorite. ca. Si oe^s. And for a token of this / is
the scripture of christ / laid under his fete when he is at mass.

Titum. i
lxvij. Christ's apostle says / that a Bisshope ought to be so well learned /
that he with the scripture / be able to overcome all them that he against the
faith.

The Pope and Bisshopes will dispute inscripture with no man / but cast them
first in preson / and proper engynes they have invented to wringe their fingers
so sore / that the blood shall braste out at their fingers ends / they pyne
them / and scorge the^ with infinite other torments payninge them / to forsake
the truth. And after make the^ swear on a book that they shall tell no man of
it thus cruelly do they entreat them against justice. And if they can not
subdue them to their wills / then do they commit them unto the seculare
power to burned.

Ioa^nis. xix
lxviij. Christ's accusation / and cause why he was condemned unto death / was
written over his head in hebrew / greek / and laten / that all men might know the
cause / this was an argument that they used justice (all though they condemned
him unjustly) sith me^ might se the offense and judgment Joined togedder.

The Pope and Bisshopes condemn men and commit them unto the seculare power
/ that they should exequute the sentence But this is a mischevous abominatio^ /
that they will not suffer the seculare power / to know the cause why they put
men to death. worshupfull / dis divines / Master doctor / O you gentle nobilite
pondre this matter indifferently. Be ware how you do exequution except you
know the cause why. Think you the blood shall not be required on you / if
for a nothers pleasure you destroy the work of God? They will say un to you
/ as the Jews said unto Pilate co^cerninge Christ / if he were not an evil
doer we would not have delivered him unto you. Trust not their words / for (no
doubt) they are lyares / know the cawse your selves. And hear the matter
unfeignedly. Think you they would not let you know the cause and judgment. If
they did justice and not tyranny? Be therefore no longer boys to the^ / which
ought to be your serva^tes / god has geven you his sprete / grace / and
vndersto^dinge / hyde not the talente that God has geven you / but do your
diligence to se iustes exequuted secludinge all tyranny / for that is your
office appointed you of God. Luce. vj^


lxix Christ says blissed are ye when me^ hate you / curse you / and
excommunicate you for the righteousness / that is to say / you no thing gyltye
nor worthy soch affliction.

The Pope and Bisshopes say that their curse is sore to be feared / ye and
that it makes men as blake as a cole in the sight of God though they have not
offended. Insomoch that they must neades be dampened except they absoile them
ageine / how be it Christ says / that they are blessed / wherefore other
Christ is false / or else they are most vain liars.

Luce. xiiij.
lxx. Christ said when thou make a dinner or feast call not thy frindes
kinsmen / and negheburs that are rich / but the poor / lame and blind /
which are not able to recompense the then shall thou be happy / for it shall
be rewarded the in the resurrection of the just.

The Pope and Busshopes will call none soch / for they think it great shame /
but they call men of great authorite and riches-which will receave the^ with
an other feast / they had lever have their belyes well stuffed in his world /
then to tarry for the promise of Christ They think it long acomynge.

Math. v Luce. vj
lxxi Christ says other make ye tree good and his fruit good also / or else make
the tree naught and his fruit naught also / Meaning that the tree first should be
good / and the^ bring forth good fruit / ye fruit makes not ye tree good. But
ye tree makes ye fruit good / al though we ca^ not know yt ye tree is good / but
by his fruit (for we can judge nothing but by his outward operation) yet god
seyth the quickenes in the rote / which in the time yt god has appointed him /
shall bring forth his fruit. And approves the tree to be good / although he
seem dead unto (...)* The tree is faith which is the mother of all good works /
which ever works by charity when he seyth occasyon.

The pope and Bisshopes say that the fruit makes the tree good / clean
contrary to all scripture and reason / And thus tvrne they the trees and the
roots upward while they affirm that faith springs and is made good of
works. And not the contrary / even as a man would say / the fruit brings
forth and makes good the tree / And not the contrary. O what madness is this?
They would make men beleve if they should long continewe / that the moon is made
of a grene chese.

lxxij. Christ says / I am the door of the fold he that enters not in by
the door but by some other way is a thief and murderare and regards not the
sheep.

The Pope / ye and all the clargye (for the most part) enter not in by Christ
/ but they run in and are not called nor sent of Christ / One enters by a
bag of monye / wherewith he byeth a fate benefyce. A another enters by
servi^ge great me^ / and coryinge favell A another / by cause he is a great
man borne / must be made a cardinal / or else a bysshope Some have ^ysons of
abbayes and other places / to speak a good word for the to yt ki^ge or other
great me^. Some enter through their curious singinge / and minyon dawnsinge /
few or none for virtue and learning.

lxxiij. Christ says I am a good shepard A good shepard geveth his lyffe for
his sheep.

The Pope and Bisshopes say also that they are good shepardes / how be it they
pille and shere their sheep so nighe / that they leve not one look of wolle on
their backs. And in all points may be likened unto the shepardes that
Zacharias prophesied of / which says / I shall reyse up a sheparde in the
earth / which shall not visit tho things that are for saken / and shall not
seek that which is gone astraye / another yet heal the discased / nor norysche
and maintain that which stondeth / but soche a sheparde that shall norysh him
silf and not the sheep and cries out of him saying O thou sheparde and idol
/ think you that this sheparde will geve his lyffe for his sheep?

Math. xxiij
lxxiiij. Christ says / Desire you not to be called master for you have but
one master which is Christ / And all you are brothers.

The Pope will be called most holy / his Cardinals / most reverend / his
Busshopes reverend / his Abbottes and Priors most and other glorious titles
have t^^y / that pass / master far. And except thou call them by those
names and titles thou shall run fare in to their indignation. Let Christ say
what he will.

lxxv. Christ commanded his disciples that they should callen^ ^han father on
the earth / Mathe. xxiij
shewinge them that they hade but one father which is in heven.

The Pope must be called most holy father / if you geve him not that name he
will excommunicate you out of his sinagoge / reason not with him / you may show
him the scripture / but it avayleth not / for he will wrest it and wringe it in
to a thousand facions / And will never leve it until he have brought it unto
his own purposse.

lxxvi. Christ's faithful serva^t Stephane / Actuum. vij
said that god almightye dwells not in temples that are made with man's
hands / according unto the prophets sayeinge / Heven is my sete and the earth
is my footestolle. Esai. lxvi ij. Reg. vii
What house will you bild for me says the lord? which is the place of my
rest? Did not my hands make all these things?

The Pope and his adhere^tes say that he dwells in this place and that place
/ the friars say we have hi^ / you must bye him of us the monks say / he is
with us / be good to our monasterye / and you shall besure to have him. A^^^o
run the selye souls from Herod to Pilate. But they find not christ / for
he dwells in no place but in the heart of a faithful man / which is the
very temple of god. j. Corin. iij


Actuum. xvij
lxxvij. Christ's Apostle Paul says. We ought not to think that God is like
gold / silver / karved stones / or any soch thing as man imageneth.

The Pope and his adherentes say that he is like a stock and a stone / and
cawseth men to make images of him / Exodi. xx
though God commanded contrary saying. Thou shall make no graven image /
another any manner of similitude af those things which are in heven above or on
the earth beneth. Another of tho things which are in the water / ^^ under the
earth / another shall thou honor or worshupe them. Joan. v.
Good christen be ware of these idolles as saint Johan councelleth the / truly
