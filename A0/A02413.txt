The Country-mans new care away. To the tune of, Love will find out the way.


IF there were employments
for men, as have been,
And Drums, Pikes, and Muskets
inth' field to be seen,
And every worthy Soldier
had truly their pay,
Then might they be bolder,
to sing, Care away.
If there were no Rooking,
but plain dealing used,
If honest Religion
were no ways abused,
If pride in the Country
did not bear sway,
The poor, and the Gentry
might sing, Care away.
If Farmers considered
the dearness of grain,
How honest poor Tradesmen
their charge should maintain,
And would b^te the price on it
to sing, Care away.
We should not be nice on it,
of what we did pay.
Af poor Tenants Landlords,
would not rack their rents,
Which often is the cause of
their great discontents:
If again good house keeping
inth' Land did hear sway,
The poor that sits weeping,
might sing, Care away.
If to live uprightly
all men were concurring,
If Lawyers with Clients
would use no demurring,
But kindly would use them,
for what they did pay;
They need not sit musing,
but sing, Care away.
If Spendthrifts were careful
and would leave their follies,
Ebriety hating,
Cards, Dice, Bowling-Alleyes,
Or with wantons to dally
by night or by day,
Their wives might be merry,
and sing, Care away.
The second part. To the same tune.


IF Children to Parents,
would dutiful be,
If Servants with Masters;
would deal faithfully,
If Gallants poor Tradesmen
would honestly pay,
Then might they have comfort,
to sing, Care away.
There is no contentment,
to a conscience that's clear,
That man is most wretched,
a bad mind does bear,
To wrong his poor Neighbor,
by night or by day,
He wants the true comfort
to sing, Care away.
But he that is ready,
by goodness to labor,
In what he is able
to helps is poor Neighbor,
The Lord will ever bless him
by night and by day,
All joys shall possess him
to sing, Care away.
Would wives with their husbands,
and husbands with wiue,
In love and true friendship
would so lead their lives,
As best might be pleasing,
to God night and day,
Then they with hearts easing,
might sing, Care away.
No cross can be greater,
unto a goodmind,
Than a man to be matched
with a woman unkind,
Whose tongue is never quiet,
but scolds night and day,
That man wants the comfort
to sing, Care away.
A virtuous woman
a husband that has,
That Is given unto lewdness,
to envy and wrath,
Who after wicked women,
does hunt for his prey,
That woman wants comfort,
to sing, Care away.
Were there no resorting,
to houses of vice,
Or were there no courting
a wench that is nice,
Yet ere she will refuse it,
the wanton will play,
Poor men might be merry,
and sing, Care away.
Like true subjects loyal,
to God let us pray,
Our good King so Royal,
to preserve night and day:
With the Queen, Prince and Nobles,
the Lord bless them aye:
Then may we all have comfort,
to sing, Care away.
