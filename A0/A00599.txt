A PARALLEL: OF NEVV-OLD Pelagiarminian Error.

Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Math. 7. 16. LONDON,
Printed for Robert Milbourne. 1626.

THE TRANSLATOR to the Reader.
Christian Reader,
THere fell lately into my hands, a Latin Copy, of the ensuing Parallel
drawn, (as I am given to understand) by two English Divines, at the request,
and for the satisfaction of a foreign Minister of State: At the first view I
laid it aside, as an evidence whereof I conceived the truths advocates,
especially in this Kingdom, had no present use. But afterward reuiewing it
more fully, and finding it very particular and punctual in this kind: and,
that on the by, it gave much light to the Disquisition of some points now in
agitation. I thought fit to translate it, for more public use. For as
Zanchius complains with much regret of the Lutheran Vbiquitaries, that he
found them vbique, every where to vex and molest him: So it is to be feared,
that the error of the Vniuersalists is too universally dispread. Many men have
too much free will, and take to themselves too free liberty now a days to
advance and maintain free will. I would to God more had the power of grace to
contend for special and saving grace, and resolutely to defend her Supremacy
above corrupt Nature. The errors touching these points, of no less consequence
then difference, are here briefly set in view in a two leafed Tablet,
representing on the one side the old, and on the other the new Pelagianisme
varnished over with a fair gloss by the pensil of Arminius, and his
Scholars. The occasion of drawing this Tablet, as I find in the Latin
Preface, was this. Acacius Baron of Dona residing some months in England, to
solicit the recovery of the Palatinate, was often set upon, and much laid at
by a stranger there named Roerghest, a man deeply engaged in the Arminian
party, who, though he could not draw him from the truth to that side, yet he
cast such mists of doubts before him, that his Lordship for better clearing,
desired the conference of some English Divines, versed in controversy of this
Nature. And opportunely meeting with two at once, after kind and respective
salutation, he demanded of them why the Divines of England so generally
distasted the doctrine broached by Arminius. Their answer was, That albeit
those tenets were plausible to corrupt reason, and set out to (...) best
advantage, by the wit and Art of the patrons thereof (...) the sacred Scripture
(to which Natural reason must bow (...) strike sail) thoroughly searched, and
impartially scanned, gave no support at all to this new model of Gods counsels
framed in man's brain, And that the prime Fathers of most eminent note in the
Church above 1^00. years ago, at the first birth of those misshapen Brats,
^^shed them against the stones, and consequently that by the same Orthodoxe
ancient Church, the new reuiuers of those er^^rs at this day were then before
hand condemned in lumbis parentum, in the loins of their parents, the whole
and half Pelagians. The Baron somewhat affected with this answer, as it should
seem, taking it indignly that Roerghest should offer thus to delude him with
false shows.

What say you, quoth he? The Doctrine so much strouen for, and so highly
extolled by some, is it nothing but old heresy new furbished over? Certesi
Arminius Pelagium refodit, merito vos Arminium defoditis. Verily if it be so,
as you affirm, that Arminius diggeth Pelagius out of his grave, you have all
reason to bury Arminius deep, that he rise not again. It was not long that
this Honorable personage, was again encountered by this solicitor Roerghest,
and further urged upon his former motives. Whereupon the Baron acquainted him
with the English Divines answer, which like strong Physic wrought presently
with his queasie stomach, and brought forth from him the Catalogue ensuing,
with a challenge, Quid tandem Arminio cum Pelagio? What kindred or
neighborhood has Arminius with Pelagius, or with the Demipelagians? This
Catalogue being then sent from him, and received by those two Divines, they
judged not complete enough to set out the bounds of the question; but thought
needful thereunto to take in more ground out of the larger fields of those
Fathers that entered into the lists of this combat. Accordingly partly out of
that Catalogue, and partly out of the ancient Fathers, they make up a kind of
list of the old errors: and as for the new, they take them out of the
Treatises of some principal Belgique Writers of that side: which, collected
into a small map, they exhibit to the Baron to be delivered to the confident
chalenger. Who upon the receipt thereof, undertook to return forthwith a
direct and punctual answer. But this Dutch Champion quitting the field, took
Sea, and returned into Holland, casting his promise to the same winds, that
filled his sails. So is his forthwith drawn forth now diverse years, and his
answer in vain expected.

So divine and admirable is the course of grace, that it reaches an helping
hand even to those who through error join hands and pens against it, and
enlightens the understandings even of those that cast mysts to dim the light
thereof. There may therefore be hope, that as Pighius endeavoring to euert
Caluins writings in point of Justification, was in that point converted
himself by them: so this Challenger considering of this answer, though with
intent to refute the same, was himself confuted by it, and rectified in his
judgment. For in this (...) of both gross and refined Pelagianisme, any m^n
that looks not through a Jesuits spectacle, may (though in small model)
behold the true shape and temper of Pelagius his frenzy in Arminius his
fancy, and resolve, as St. Jerome did, in a like case, Aut Plato Philonizat,
aut Philo Platonizat, Either the Pelagian predestination was ex praenisa fide
Arminij, out of the foreseen faith of Arminius, or Arminius his devise out of
the fore-read faith of Pelagius.

If any, after he has viewed this table, cast a scorn upon it, as composed
by some gloating Puritan, and condemn Criminis inauditi, of a new found
crime, namely of doctrinall Puritanisme all those that give any credit to such
Parallells, or differ from him in those points, I will give no sentence against
him, but refer him to read it in Tully, Cic. de Orat.
Aut est ex ijs, qui illos non norunt, aut ex ijs, qui iudicare non possunt,
Either he knows not the parties whose tenets are here set one by the other,
or he wants judgment to compare, and for defect thereof, Cosens himself with
Mountebanke wares. The proverb is, Inter caecos luscum regnare posse, That
among blind men, a purblinde or blinkard may dominere, and put tricks upon
them. But, God forbid, that any of the Seers of Israel should mistake old
heresy new coined, for current truth. At the first setting of the Mint on work
by James Harman at Leyden, when a piece new stamped was transported, and
presented to King JAMES, our late Sovereign, of most blessed memory, upon the
very first cast of his eye, he discovered it to be no better then an half
faced groat of the Semipelagian alloy. Et statim perfodit stylo Regio, and
forthwith stabbed it through with his Royal pen, and branded the Master of the
Mint with the title of the enemy of God. And that the same judicious King
persisted in this his judgment, both of the Coin and Coyners even to the end,
to me it is a thing most evident, by a faithful and allowed relation, which I
have seen of diverse remarkable directions and instructions given by his
Majesty to two Divines, about a month before his death, questioned before him
about a book then published, touching the Doctrine of St. Austen.

In that discourse, his Majesty having occasion to touch upon the Treatises of
St. Augustine, that are extant in the seventh Tome, (which he might seem
prophetically to recommend as a sovereign antidote against an evil vpcreeping
since his death) he styled them St. Austins Polemicall tracts against the
heretics that agree with our Arminians: and presently calling to mind their
proper name, termed those heretics (from the Author of that Sect) the
Pelagians. Which Paraphrase of his Majesty, because it gives much life to the
ensuing Tablet, and this Tablet light to his Majesty's speech, I have made bold
to borrow the Character of the Press, to imprint both more deeply in thy
memory: and to express to thee my desire to serve as a voluntary, (as did that
excellently learned and zealous Archbishop Bradwardin) In causa Dei contra
Pelagianos, in Gods cause and quarrel against the Pelagians.

A CATALOGVE OF THE PELAGIAN DOCtrines, condemned by Ancient Fathers, and
Counsels.
1 THe sin of Adam is not imputed to his postetitie.

2 Adam by his sin endamaged only himself properly, but his Posterity
only by his example, so far forth as they imitate him.

3 There is no Original sin, or corruption of humane nature.

4 Every man is borne in the same perfection wherein Adam was before his fall,
save only the perfection of age, which in his posterity wants the use of
reason, when they are newborn.

5 Temperall death is from the necessity of nature, and did not come upon all
the posterity of Adam, for the first sin of their first Parent.

6 Adam himself should have dyed by the necessity of nature, though he had
not sinned.

7 Much less did Adam bring upon his Postritie the guilt of eternal death for
his sin.

8 Children in Baptism do not receive remission of Original sin.

9 Those who maintain the Doctrine of Original sin, condemn Marriage.

10 By Grace is meant Nature endued with Reason and Will.

11 Supernatural grace consists in the Doctrine of the Law, and pardon of
sins.

12 Forgiveness is not necessary for all. Because all do not sin: or at least,
some may be without sin.

13 Those, who have sinned, may by the power of nature repent, without inward
grace from the spirit.

14 The grace of Christ is not elsewhere to be sought for, then in the
Doctrine, and life, or example of Christ.

15 If there be any inward help received from the Holy Ghost, the same
consists only in the enlightening of the understanding. But as for the Will,
that needs no inward grace.

16 Man by his natural inbred faculties is able perfectly to fulfill the Law.

17 Grace is profitable for the fulfilling of the Law, but not necessary
thereto.

18 Man of himself is able to resist the strongest temptations: though indeed,
he does it with more facility, if he be helped by grace.

19 By the works of nature man promeriteth (or gayneth) the aid of grace.

20 That which proceeds from forgetfulness, or ignorance, has not in it the
property of sin.

21 In the New Testament all kind of oaths are forbidden.

22 Rich men, unless they fell their goods, and give them to the poor cannot
be saved.

23 The well using of free will, and of natural powers is the cause of
Predestination.

24 Christ dyed not for all men: at least not for Infants; because they are
without sin.

The Errors of the Semipelagians or Massilians.
1 THe beginning of Faith, and the desire of conversion is from our selves, the
increase is from grace.

2 Man, if not always, yet sometimes preuents God, by the preparation of his
own will. By which endeavor of nature God is moved to bring, through the aid
of his Spirit, to the grace of regeneration the Will so prepared.

3 For perseverance in Faith and Grace there is no need of new and special
grace. What we have by nature, or have formerly gotten by the spirit of grace,
suffices for such perseverance.

April. 1. 1621. In the name of God, and to the praise of the glory of his
grace. Ephesians. 1. 6.
A brief answer, by way of Parallele, to the foregoing Catalogue, and to the
Demand therewith sent; What affinity is there between PELAGIANS, or
DEMIPELAGIANS on the one side, and the ARMINIANS one the other.
THe Index of the Pelagian assertions, consisting of 24. Propositions, had
need of an Index expurgatorius, a purging Index, The last of them is no
Doctrine held by Pelagius, but an absurdity, or inconvenience, inferred upon
his Tenets by some; yet by him constantly denied in direct terms. Which this
gatherer might have learned of Gerard Vossius, Histor. Pelag. lib. 2. por. 2.
These. 4. from whom he took upon trust this Catalogue. Moreover to what end is
here raked together the draffe of so many herefies, whereof the greater part
was renounced by the Father, that begat them? As appears in many places of
St. Austens Treatises against his heresies. Lastly, how impertinent are those
proposions concerning oaths, rich men's goods, and the mortality of Adam in
the state of Innocence, etc? Who ever, so much as by dream, did think to
fasten this upon the Aminians? So that of the 24. Pelagian Positions here
rehearsed, six only may look this way; namely, the third, seventh, tenth,
fifteenth, nineteenth, three and twentieth. The rest needed not to have been
pressed for this service.

1. Of Original Sin.
Pelagians.
PPropos. 3. There is no Original sin.

Out of St. Aug. de Nuptijs. Man is not borne with original sin. Original
sin is no sin: because not voluntary.

Propos. 7. Adam did not bring upon his Posterity the guilt of eternal death
for his sin.

Out of the Epistle of Gelasius. It seems not just, that Gods creature,
without any action of his own, should be borne guilty of sin, or entangled
in sin.

Item ibid. That children dying without baptism cannot be damned for Original
sin only.

Arminians.
ARnoldus Coruinus against Tilenus, page 388. Arminius teaches, that Original
sin has not the nature of sin, or fault, properly so called.

Arminius himself, to the 9. question, page 174. It is wrongfully said, that
Original sin makes a man guilty of Death.

Arnold. Ibidem page 391. Arminius indeed holds, that no man is damned for
only Original sin.

Note also, that both these endeavor to strengthen this their opinion with
arguments concluding not only that none are actually damned for Original
sin, but also that none justly can be. For if so, then

1 God should deal more rigorously with such men, then he does with the
Devils.

2 That which is a punishment of sin, cannot deserve eternal punishment. For
then would there be endless process, if one punishment should still deserve
another.

2 Of the meaning of the word Grace.
Pelag.
PRopos. 10. By the word Grace is meant, nature endued with reason and will.

Out of Aug. Epist. 105. Pelagius by that Grace which he acknowledged to be
given without any foregoing merits, did mean the nature of man, wherein we
are created. Forasmuch, as before we had any being, we could merit that we
should have a being.

Armin.
ARnoldus Ibid. page 158. The Gentiles by nature do the things of the Law. And
how little soever that be, which a man in the estate of Corruption can do,
God wills that he should do it, and when man does this, he uses grace well.

Item page 157. Upon demand whether a man in the estate of corruption can
rightly use the light of reason: he presently resolves, that it is required,
that a man in the estate of Corruption do rightly use that grace, which he
has, and perform whatsoever he can, by that Grace given him.

It need not seem strange that the Arminians make Nature to be Grace, who
maintain that there is a general grace imprinted in all men without
exception. Which what can it be else but Nature, and her endowments? Now if
any shall object, that this in effect is nothing but an idle strife about
words, let him consider, that this is the hidden spring of the most pestilent
poison of Pelagins. For out of this may they wash away and put off any thing,
that is brought by the maintainers of Grace. If allegetion be made against him,
that We are saved by grace. Their answer is ready. True. To wit by nature,
which is the first and general grace. By grace I am that I am. True. By grace,
that is by nature, whereof God is the free Donor. Faith is the gift of God.
True. Because out free will, by which we ascent, is the gift of God the
Creator. And if St. Austen himself shall press against them, that Grace only
discernes a believer from an unbeliever. Why may they not answer. True sir.
That is, only Free Will, which is most freely given us by God.

3 Of the cause of the increase of Grace.
Pelag.
PRopos. 19. By the works of nature a man promeriteth, or gains the aid of
grace.

Out of the Counsel at Diospolis. Grace is given according to men's merits.

Out of Saint Austen in his Treatise of Perseverance. Three points there are
which the Catholic Church does principally maintain against the Pelagians.
Whereof the first is, that Grace is not given according to our merits.

The same Aug. Grace (according to Pelagius) is given though not according to
the desert of good works, yet according to the desert of a good will. His
reason is: Otherwise God should be an accepter of persons, if he should have
mercy on whom he will, without any foregoing merits.

Armin.
ARminius Exam. page 218. Tell me Sir, in this speech of Christ, To him that
has shall be given, Is not that promise contained, by which God engages
himself to enlighten with supernatural grace him, who well uses the light of
nature, or at least uses it less ill?

Arnoldus against Tilen, page 165. The cause why the Gospel is revealed to
babes, is because they show themselves ready to learn. The rule is general,
which teaches without limitation that, To him that has, that is, well uses,
God will give grace.

4 Of the aid of Grace in conversion.
Pelag.
PRoposit. 15. If there be any inward help received from the holy Ghost, that
consists only in the enlightening of the understanding. But as for the Will,
that needs no inward Grace.

Out of Saint Aug. ad Bon^f. 4. cap. 5. We receive from the Lord the help of
knowledge, whereby we know those things which ought to be done, but not the
inspiration of Charity, that we may with an holy love perform those things we
know, which is properly Grace.

Armin.
THe Hage Conference set out by Bertius, page 279. Infusion of holiness has
no place in the will. In as much as the Will in its own nature is free to will
good or evil. -- In the spiritual death, the gifts, properly called
spiritual, are separated from the will of man, because they were never in it;
but only a freedom of doing well, or ill.

Ibidem, page 272. God will give a new heart. We think that by heart is meant
the soul of man; and that it is called new; both in regard of the infusion of
new light and knowledge, and also in respect of new works of conversion,
which it self brings forth.

5 Of the cause of Predestination.
Pelag.
PRopos. 23. The well using of Free well, and natural powers is the cause of
Praedestination.

The Arminians do not deny, but that the decree of Gods Election depends
upon the foreseen free assent of man's will, even then when all the helps of
saving grace being afforded, it may yet dissent by its own natural and inbred
liberty: as hereafter appears. Why therefore may they not climb to the very
top of Pelagianisme, and so auow, that the good use of our natural freewill
does poise down the even balance of Gods Praedestination, and determine the
otherwise wavering decree of God? Howsoever they decline the name of Cause in
election, and hold forth in stead thereof the attribute of a foregoing
condition, yet in effect they must needs hit against this rock, at which
Pelagius suffered Shipwreck.

As for Demipelagianisme, there are but three heads of that Hydra put forth in
this Catalogue; the other lie hidden, and pulled in, like the horns of a
Snaile being touched. Which here (by the help and hand of the most found
Fathers) are to be drawn forth, and to be clapped on the shoulders of those, who
in these times act the same parts.
1 Of Election upon foreseen Faith.
Demipelagians.
OVt of Saint Prospers Epistle to Saint Austen. That God foreknew before the
foundation of the world, Who would believe, and persevere in that faith, which
in process should be helped by grace. And that he Praedestinated those to his
Kingdom, whom, being freely called, he foresawe would become worthy of his
Election, and depart this life making a good end.

Out of the Epistle of Saint Hilary to Saint Austen extant in the seventh Tome
of Austeus Works. They (the Demipelagians or Massilians) will have
Predestination to reach no farther then this, that God Praedestinated, or
foreknew, or decreed to elect those that would believe.

Arminians.
HAge Conference, page 62. Bert. God before the Foundations of the World were
laid appointed to save by Christ, those out of mankind, who by the grace of
the spirit would believe, and persevere in that faith and obedience by the same
grace.

Item. Ibid. The purpose to save those, that persevere in faith, is the whole
entire decree of Election.

Item page 90. That precise and and absolute decree, whereby God is said in
Electing to consider these, or those men, no otherwise then as singular
persons, and to have had no respect unto the good qualities, which he foresawe
-- such a Decree cannot stand with the nature of God, or with the Scriptures.

Arminius against Perkins, page 221. I deny that Election is the rule of giving
or not giving Faith.

Hage Confer. page 38. We profess openly, that Faith in Gods foresight and
consideration is before Election to salvation, and does not follow Election, as
a fruit thereof.

2 Of the uncertain number of the Elect.
Demipelagians.
PRospers Epistle to Saint Austen. They would not yield that the number of the
Praedestinated cannot be increased or diminished.

Hilar. Arelatens. to Saint Austen. Likewise they will not admit the number to
be certain of those, that are to be elected, and those that are to be rejected.

Faustus. That there are not of men some deputed to life, others to
destruction, but that men may pass from salvation to perdition, and from
perdition to salvation.

Arminians.
GRevinchov. in his Theses exhibited, page 137. and others. Vncomplete Election
may be interrupted, and sometime is. And those, that are vnco^pletely elected.
are truly Elect. Yet may they become Reprobates, and perish. And the number of
the Elect may be increased and diminished.

Item. No man as long as he remains in this life, is peremptorily elected:
But he only is peremptorily elected, who dies, or rather is already dead, in
faith and obedience.

(So by this reckoning no man living is an Elect)

3. Of the universality of Grace and calling.
Demipelag.
OVt of Prospers Epistle to Saint Augustine, extant in Saint Austens seventh
Tome. They say, that all men universally are called to salvation either by the
Law of Nature, or the written Laws, or by the preaching of the Gospel.

Armin
ARnold against Tilen. page 397. God by his Spirit, effectual in the Law,
works after some manner, and in some degree in all men; to the end, that by
little and little they may be brought to the faith of Christ, whom God for his
part is ready to reveal to all men.

4 Of works of Praeparation.
Demipelag.
THe first Proposition. The beginning of Faith and desire of Conversion is from
our selves, the increase is from Grace.

Out of Prosper. Even after the fall there remained in Adam certain seeds of
Virtues, which by the Creators gift, are sown in the mind of every man.

Item. That we must beware least we so far refer unto God all the good
works of the Saints, that we ascribe nothing unto man's nature, but only that
which is evil and perverse.

Item: Therefore a man receives, finds, enters, because using well the good
of nature, by the help of this initiall grace, he has obtained to come saving
grace.

The second Proposition. Man, if not always, yet sometime preuenteth God by
the preparation of his own will. By which endeavor of nature, God is moved to
bring, through the aid of his Spirit, to the grace of Regeneration the Will so
prepared.

Arminians.
ARnoldus page 403. Man in the state of Corruption, has some relics of
spiritual life, to wit, some kind of desire of the good, which he knows.

Arminius against Perkins, page 137. It is false, that an unregenerate man is
wholly flesh, that is, that there is nothing in him but flesh.

Arnoldus page 158. Arminius thinks, that God in this manner will give more
and greater gifts to him that well uses grace. (That is, the light of nature,
as before appears in the third Article of Pelagius.)

In the Epistle ad Walachros, page 45. Those, who are amended by the natural
knowledge of the Law, and by the better use of common grace, are by God deemed
somewhat worthy to receive a further grace, and that by the gifts and good
pleasure of God.

5 Of the Wills freedom in conversion.
Demipelag.
OVt of Hilar. to Aug. They affirm the Will to be so free, that it can of it
own accord admit or refuse cure or medicine.

Out of Prosper. As for the Wills fredome, (they say) that life is laid hold on
by those, who believe of their own accord, and entertain the aid of grace,
by the merit, or act, of their credulity.

Faustus. It is of the mercy of God, that men are called: but the following
that call, is referred to their own Will.

Petrus Diaconus contra Faustum. They babble vainly, who say. To Will to
believe is mine, or from me; but to help is of Gods grace. Whereas
contrariwise, the Apostle testifies, that the very believing it self is given
of God.

Cassianus. The whole is not so to be ascribed to grace, but that free Will is
to have some share of commendation of the forwardness thereof.

Item. Two things there are which work man's salvation, Gods grace, and and
man's obedience.

Faustus lib. 1. Expounding Christ's words, No man comes to me, unless my
Father draw him; says, that to draw is nothing else, but to preach, to stir
up with comforts of the Scripture, to deter by reproves, to propound things
desirable, to represent things dreadful, to threaten judgment, to promise
reward.

Armin.
ARnoldus. page 337. Grace does not so furnish a man with new strength, but
that it always remains in a man's pewer to make use of that strength, or not.

Hage Confer. page 282. A man may hinder his own Regeneration, even then, when
God will regenerate him; or does will to regenerate him.

Arnold. against Bogerman, page 263. All the operations, which God uses to the
conversion of man, being already performed, yet this conversion still remains
in man's power: so that he can convert, or not convert himself, believe, or
not believe.

Arminius against Perkins, page 223. The whole or entire cause, why this man
believes, and that man believes not, is the will of God, and man's freewill.

Arnold. against Tilen. page 136. It is not absurd, that a man by his own
will should discern himself from an unbeliever.

Hage Conference, page 315. The discerning a man self from another man, may
be attributed unto man.

Grevinchove against Am. page 297. Nothing hinders, but that only moral grace
may make natural men spiritual.

Arminius against Perk. page 2^3. Faith is so from the mere will of God, that
Gods will does not use an omnipotent and irresistable motion to beget faith, in
men, but a gentle swasion, and accommodated for the moving of man's will
according to the nature of its freedom.

Item, page 220. The Author of grace intends by grace to move man's will, to
assent by a gentle and sweet swasion; which motion does not only not take
away the free consent of freewill, but also establishes it.

Hage Confer. page 291. Is not that the most noble manner of working upon man,
which is performed by inducements and monition? Would not the working be
strong enough, if it were such as Satan uses?

6 Of Perseverance.
Demipelag.
PRopos. 3. For Perseverance in Faith and Grace, three needs no new and
special grace. What we either have by nature, or have formerly gotten by the
spirit of grace, suffices for such Perseverance.

The Proposition should rather have been thus formed.

Out of Saint Austin in his Treatise of Perseverance. That Perseverance to the
end is in our power, and is not the gift of God.

Out of Hilar. to Aust. Neither will they yield, that such perseverance is
given to any man, from which he is not suffered to revolt, but such, as from
which he may by his Freewill fall away.

This Proposition cannot be be fairly prescribed for the true state of the
question, much less for the whole question of Perseverance. For the
Demipelagians did not deny the aid of new Grace for perseuering, as is evident
by Prospers words forecicited, God foresaw, who would believe, and persevere in
that Faith, which in process should be helped by Grace.

Armin.
HAge Confer. page 62. of the latter part. Perseverance is ill called a gift.
It is an act of the Will, which may admit, or despise the motion of the spirit.

The Remonstrants Theses exhibited. All things being forelayd, which are
necessary and sufficient for perseverance, it remains still in the power of
man to persevere, or not persevere.

7 The common clamorous Objection.
Demipelag.
PRrosper of the calling of the Gentiles. They object, that it is in vain to
labor to obtain the worth and excellency of good works, in vain to be
instant in Prayers, whereby God is entreated to grant our requests, if so be
that the election unto Christian grace depend upon the unchangeable purpose of
of God.

Prosper in his Epistle to Austin. They vpbraid, that all care of rising out of
sin is taken away from those that are lapsed: that to holy men is ministered
an occasion of lukewarmenesse; inasmuch as the Elect cannot fall away by any
negligence, howsoever they behave themselves. That all industry is laid aside,
that virtues are taken away, if Gods determination prevent man's will.

Anstin of Perseverance Chap. 12. The Pelagians object, That we tie Gods grace
to Destiny. See also ad Bonifac. lib. 1. cap. 5.

Prosper. Ibidem. They say, that under the name of Praedestination, fatal
nececessity is brought in.

Armin.
HAge Conference, page 12 etc. the latter part. This Doctrine in it self, and
of it self, is an hinderance to godliness, and also to good manners, both to
the teachers and hearers. It leads to carnal security, it takes away true
sorrow for sins committed, as also the watchful care of rising up from
sin, and the fear of being hardened in sin in process of time.

It takes away Prayers, Obsecrations, Obtestations, Admonitions, Threatenings,
Promises, Commands, Counsels, Commendations, and Rewards.

This Doctrine brings into the Church Manichisme, Stoicisme, Libertinisme,
Epicurisme.

To the Arminians book (of their Acta Synodalia) this Emblem is prefixed, An
armed Lion (the Arms of Holland) with a Capp (the badge of Liberty) over which
is written this triumphant Motto,

DESTINY DESTROYED, OR The overthrow of Fate. When Demipelagianisme was
objected against Arminius, Armin art^culo 10.
he ingeniously answered, that it might be a good Q^aere, why Demipelagianisme
should not be accounted true Christianisme.

But Prosper demonstrating upon substantial g^ou^ds, that the Pelagians, and
Demipelagians stick together in the same mire, does cage them both in the same
Parallel, Prosp cont. Coll torem Cap. 41.
in these words. The budds are of the same kind, which come from the same
seed, and that which is couched low in the root, appears in the fruit. We
are not therefore to skirmish against these men with new levied forces, nor to
enter into a special list, as against unknown enemies. These mean Engines were
then shattered in pieces, then they fell to the ground in their Companions, and
ringleaders of their pride, when Innocentius, of blessed memory, smote the
heads of this abominable error with the dint of the Apostolic Sword, when the
Synod of the Bishops of Palestina compelled Pelagius to pronounce sentence
against himself, and his followers.

If we tie this misshapen monster with the bands of a Syllogism, Proteus being
fast manacled will utter his concealed Oracle thus, Demipelagianisme is true
Christianisme ( Arminius sticks not at it)
But Demipelagianisme is Pelagianisme (Prosper avowes it)
Therefore Pelagianisme is true Christianisme (though Catholic doctrine cry it
down.)


With which close we sum up this our Parallel.

LONDINI, Impensis ROBERTI MYLBOVRNE. 1626.

Salutem in ipso, qui fons Gratiae.
AMice noster, veritatis magis. Quem per Epistolam repetito flagitabas,
Parallelum, una cum ejusde^ conscribendi caussa necessaria, ad te per notum
Hermetem, licet aliquanto serius, jam transmitto. Tu quaeso inter legendum
amict sepone personam, indue judicis: and, si quid titubatum sit, pro tuo
candore, ac liberate, moan; eo redibit gratior, quo obeliscis tuis
compunctior. Absit ut Arminianis ideo stupescant dentes, quia labruscas
comederat Pelagius, aut delicatiores Pelagii nepotes, nisi constiterit
Arminianos itidem acidum inde expressum plena hausisse amphora, and aliis avide
etiamnum propinare. In hac (...) ad geometricam normam composita, sancte
profiteor, imprimis cautum, ne quid distortum, inversum, aut depravatum
affingeretur, quo facilius, aut speciosius antiquis erroribus novi quadrare
viderentur. Verum ut in picturis nimis exiguis, aut speculis minutioribus
vultus integros vix datur distinct intueri; in tabella isthac adeo contracta
singulos gemini istius Monstri artus and articulos conspici posse hand quidem
sperandum. Haec tantummodo ad synopsin, and specimen properata potius, quam
maturata.

Opportunum forte, hic tertiam adstrui columnam, quae sententiam orthodoxam
singulis erroribus recto ordine oppositam representaret. Quorsum vero tibi, vir
doctissime, hanc praeire facem; utpote in Augustini, Patrumque reliquorum
eandem doctrinam luculenter asserentium, solid ex Scripturis confirmantium
scriptis versatissimo? Neque certe mihi hic quicquam de navo aggredi visum; sed
hoc tantum, quod in usum unius privatum olim postulatum est, ac conscriptum,
denuo recognoscere, tibique in peculium transcribere. Quod tui juris esto,
prout etiam ipse, a quoprius hoc promissum, jam missum.

CVm abhinc quasi triennio Honoratissimus Dominus Acacius Baro de Dona
recuperandi Palatinatus negotium promoturus aliquot menses in Anglia
versaretur, a quodam extero philologo Roerghesto solicitatur in parts, quae
vocantur, Arminianas. Quem licet ab orthodoxa integritate deflectere non
potuerat ille Belga, nebulis tamen quibusdam offusis ita veritatem ei
obscuravit, ut ad glaucomam hanc dispellendam collyrium aliquoties expeteret a
Theologis quibusdam Anglis. Quos simul duos opportune salutatos and colloquio
privato adhibitos interrogat, Quid tandem caussae quod ad Anglorum stomachu^
non faciant Arminii fercula. Ab illis responsum, ea dogmata, ut ut corruptae
rationi allubescant, and patronoru^ subtilitate excolantur, ac splendescant, si
tamen ad Scripturae sacrae normam redigantur, facile internosci, ac sordescere:
ipsa esse, quae a Patribus orthodoxis in Ecclesia nominatissimis a primo ortu
statim profligata sunt: adeoque hodiernos eorundem instauratores in lumbis
parentum olim damnatos. Itane vero, inquit? Haeccine, pro qua tam fervide a
nonnullis dimicatur, doctrina nil aliud est, quam haeresis antiqua de novo
limata, ac polita? Certe si Pelagium refodiat Arminius, merito vos Angli
Arminium defoditis. Paulo post eide^ Roerghesto iterum se obtrudenti, and
antiquum occinenti, responsum Theologorum impertit Donanus. Quo nonnibil
perstrictus Belga, antiquas illas haereses anquirit, catalogum consarcinat:
eoque in D^i Donani manum tradito, binos hosce Theologos in arenam provocans,
Quid Arminio, inquit, cum Pelagio, aut Semipelagianis? Acceptum hunc Catalogum
iidem Theologinimis arctum judicarunt, qui quaestioni illi justos limits
describeret; ideoque ulterius pergendum in Patrum hosce impugnantium campos
latiores. Inde ipsum horum errorum nidum depromunt; dogmata autem Arminiana e
Batavorum quorundam libellis eruunt: ac utrosque inter se (...) componunt.
Descriptum exemplar statim Donano tradunt deferendum in manus Roerghesto
provocatori. Qui, accepto hoc rescripto, se ad singula punctim confestimque
responsurum pollicetur. Sed pelago deportatur Pelagii pugil.

Hunc querimur ventis and vela, and verba dedisse.
Vela liquet reditu, verba carere fide.
Eo quippe in Hollandiam reverso, adbuc toto triennio promissum illud non
exoluitur, confestim illud ampliatur.

1 PEccatum Adami posteris ejus non imputatur.

2 Sibi soli Adamus peccans nocuit proprie; posteris non nisi exemplo, quatenus
imitantur.

3 Originale peccatum, sive naturae humanae corruption nulla est.

4 Quilibet homo eadem perfectione nascitur, qua fuit Adam ante lapsum, dempta
perfectione aetatis, quae in posteris recens natis usu rationis caret.

5 Mors temporalis est a necessitate naturae; minimeque propter primi parentis
primum peccatum redundavit in posteros.

6 Ipsemet Adam lege and necessitate naturae moriturus erat, etiamsi non
peccasset.

7 Multo minus aeternae mortis reatum induxit posteris Adam peccato suo.

8 Parvuli in Baptismo non accipiunt remissionem peccati originalis.

9 Qui tuentur dogma de peccato originali, damnant nuptias.

10 Gratia significat naturam ratione and voluntate praeditam.

11 Supernaturalis gratia spectatur in doctrina Legis, and condonatione
peccatorum.

12 Haec posterior, puta condon: pecc: non omnibus est necessaria. Quia non
omnes peccant, saltem possunt carere peccato.

13 Qui peccarunt, possunt ex naturae viribus resipiscere absque interna gratia
Spiritus sancti.

14 Gratia Christi non alibi quaerenda, quam in doctrina, and vita, seu exemplo
Christi.

15 Si quod hic obtingit auxilium internum Spiritus sancti, illud in sola
intellectus illuminatione est positum. Nulla autem voluntati opus est gratia
interna.

16 Homo viribus ex creatione sibi insitis legem penitus implere potest.

17 Gratia ad ligis impletione^ utilis quidem est, non ite^ necessaria.

18 Homo etiam gravissimis tentationibus per se potest resistere, licet
facilius id praestet, si adjuvetur a gratia.

19 Per opera naturae homo promeretur auxilium gratiae.

20 Quod ab oblivione, vel ignorantia proficiscitur, non habet rationem peccati.

21 In novo Testamento omne juramentum est vetitum.

22 Divites, nisi bona sua vendant, and pauperibus dent, non possunt servari.

23 Bonus usus liberi arbitrij, and virium naturalium est causa

peccato.

2 Homo, si non semper, saltem aliquando praevenit Deum praeparatione propriae
voluntatis; quo naturae conatu movetur Deus, ut voluntatem ita praeparatam
auxilio Spiritus sancti ad regenerationis gratiam perducat.

3 Ad perseverantiam in fide and gratia non opus est nova and speciali gratia:
sufficit ad hoc, vel quod natura habemus, vel quod semel per spiritum gratiae
adepti sumus.

ASsertionum Pelagianaru^ Indiculus Propositiones 24 continens, eget Indice
Expurgatorio. Vltima plane non est Pelagij dogma, sed tantummodo (...) quoddam,
quo urgebatur a quibusdam Pelagii sententia, ab ipso tamen constanter negatum.

Deinde vero quorsum colluvies illa tot haeresum, quarum (saltem majoris partis)

Pelagianos passim. Denique illa quam (...) de Divitibus bona vendentibus, de
Iuramento, de Adami integri mortalitate? Quis haec unquam Arminianis vel per
somnium cogitavit imputanda?

Adeoque ex Pelagii placitis 24 hic recensitis sex tantum huc videntur
spectare, nempe 3. 7. 10. 15. 19. 23. Reliqua valere jubemus.

1 De peccato originali.
PELAGIANI.
Propos. 3. Originale peccatum nullum est.

Ex Aug. de nupt. Homo non nascitur cum originali peccato. Peccatum originis
non est peccatum: Quia non est voluntarium.

Propos. 7. Multo minus aeternae mortis reatum induxit Adam posteris suo
peccato.

Ex Epist. Gelasii. Iustum non videtur, quod factura Dei sine ullis propriis
actionibus cuiquam peccato nascatur obstricta.

Ite^ ex Ep. Gelasii. Parvulos sine Baptismo decedentes non posse pro solo
originali peccato damnari.

ARMINIANI.
Arnoldus Corvinus cont. D. Tilenum page 388. Arminius docet peccatum originis
nullam culpae proprie dictae rationem habere.

Arminius respons. ad quaest. 9. page 174. Perverse dicitur, peccatu^ originale
reum mortis facere.

Arn. Corv. ib. page 391. Equidem Arminius statuit neminem propter solum
peccatum originis damnari.

Hanc sententiam argumentis propugnant uterque concludentibus, non tantum actu
non damnari, sed nec just posse damnari.

Si enim, tum Deus long rigidius cum talibus ageret, quam cum Diabolis.

Item. Quod est poena peccati, non meretur aeternam poenam: Quia tune esset
processus in infinitum, si poena poenam mereretur.

2 De significatu Gratiae.
PELAG.
Propos. 10. Gratia significat naturam ratione and voluntate praeditam.

Ex Aug. Epistola 105. Gratiam illam, quam volebat Pelagius sine ullis
praecedentibus meritis dari, esse humanam naturam, in qua conditi sumus. Neque
enim antequam essemus, mereri aliquid poteramus, ut essemus.

ARMIN.
Arnold, Ib. page 158. Gentes natura faciunt, quae sunt legis. Quantulum vero
sit, quod homo corruptus potest, hoc vult Deus ut faciat: and, hoc dum facit,
Gratia recte utitur.

Item. Page 157. Quaesito, an homo corruptus recte possit uti lumine naturae,
statim explicat, requiri, ut homo corruptus, gratia, quam habet, recte utatur,
and faciat quodcunque per gratiam sibi collatam potest facere.

Nec vero mirum, Arminianis Naturamesse Gratiam, qui Gratiam generalem omnibus
ubique terrarum hominibus insitam tuentur. Quae quid quaeso distat ab ipsa
Natura, ejusque dotibus? Quod si quis obstrepat, hanc levis esse momenti (...),
cogitet pestilentissimi veneni Pelagiani fontem hunc esse occultum. Hinc enim
facile eludent atque eluent omnia, quae a Gratiae assertoribus afferuntur,
Quidni regerant scilicet, Gratia salvi facti estis. Certe: nempe natura, quae
gratia prima, and universalis. Dei gratia sum quod sum. Hoc est natura, cujus
gratis author Deus. Fides donum Dei. Plane. Nam ipsa, qua credimus, libera
voluntas est donum creatoris Dei. Denique si instet Augustinus, Sola Gratia
discernit fidelem ab infideli. Quidni respondeant? Certe. Nempe sola voluntas
libera, quae gratis and (...) a Deo data est.

3 De progressus Gratiae causa.
PELAG.
Propos. 19. Per opera naturae homo promeretur auxilium gratiae.

Ex Concilio Diospolitano, Gratiam Dei secundum hominum merita dari.

Ex Aug. de bono persever. cap. 2. Tria sunt, quae maxim adversus Pelagianos
Catholica defendit Ecclesia. Quorum est unum, Gratiam Dei non secundum merita
nostra dari.

Ex eodem Aug. Licet non secundum merita bonoru^ operum, tamen secundum merita
bonae voluntatis datur gratia. Ratio Pelagii est. Alioqui Deus esset acceptor
personaru^, si sine ullis praecedentibus meritis, cujus vult, miseretur.

ARMIN.
Armin. exam. page 218. Vide mihi, annon isto dicto Christi, Habenti dabitur,
promissio ista contineatur, qua Deus spondet se gratia supernaturali
illuminaturum, qui lumine naturae recte utetur, aut saltem utetur, quantum
poterit, minus male.

Arnold. contra Til. page 165. Caussa, cur parvulis reveletur Evangelium, est
quod Deus eos illuminet, qui dociles se praebent. Generalis est sententia, quae
docet in genere, Deum habenti, hoc est, been utenti additurum gratiam.

4 De auxilio gratiae in Conversione.
PELAG.
Propos. 15. Si quod hic obtingat auxiliu^ Spiritus Sancti internum, illud in
sola intellectus illuminatione est positum. Nulla autem voluntati opus est
gratia interna.

Ex Aug. ad Bonif. 4. cap. 5. A Domino adjutorium cognitionis habemus, quo ea
quae facienda sunt, novimus, non susspirationem dilectionis, ut cognita sancto
amore faciamus; quae proprie gratia est.

ARMIN.
Collat. Hag. Bert. page 279. In voluntate locum non habet sanctitatis infusio,
ut quae natura sua libera est ad volendum bonum aut malum. Ite^, In morte
spirituali non separantur proprie dona spiritualia ab humana voluntate, cum ea
nunquam in illa fuerint; sed libertas duntaxat been, aut male agendi.

Ibidem page 272. Dabit Deus cor novum. Nos arbitramur, hic per Cor significari
posse animam humanam: eamque novam vocari, tum ob novi luminis and novae
notitiae infusionem, tum ob nova conversionis opera, quae ipsa profert.

5 De caussa Praedestinationis.
PELAG.
Propos. 23. Bonus usus liberi arbitrii, and virium naturalium est caussa
Praedestinationis.

Non diffitentur Arminiani Divinae Electionis decretum pendere ex praeviso
libero voluntatis humanae assensu, etiam tune cum possit omnibus gratiae
salvificae auxiliis positis, dissentire pro innata and naturali suae liberate:
prout infra patebit. Quidni ergo altius ad ipsum hunc Pelagianismum aspirent,
De bono usu liberi arbitrii Praedestinationis aequilibrium hanc in partem
inclinante, ac determinante pendulum decretum Dei? Vtcunque nomen quidem
caussae hic declinent, and substituaent praecedaneae conditionis larvam, in
hunc tamen Scopulum re ipsa impingunt, ad que^ olim Pelagius naufragiu^ fecit.

Ad Semipelagianismum quod attinet, nobis in Indice proposito tria tantum hujus
Hydrae capita oftentantur. Reliqua occultantur, and, quasi limacis cornua,
intus retrahuntur. Quae, admota orthodoxorum Patru^ manu, nunc extrahenda, and
personatis hodiernis ejusdem fabulae histrionibus induenda.

1 De Electione ex praevisa fide.
SEMIPELAGIANI.
Ex Prosperi Epist. ad Aug. Qui credituri sunt, quique in ea fide, quae
deinceps per gratiam Dei sit juvanda, mansuri sunt, praescisse ante Mundi
constitutionem Deum: and eos praedestinasse in Regnum suum, quos gratis vocatos
dignos futuros electione, and de hac vita bono fine excessuros esse praeviderat.

Ex Hilarii Epistola. Praedestinationem ad id valere contendunt, ut eos
praedestinaverit, vel praesciverit, vel eligere proposuerit, qui fuerant
credituri.

ARMINIANI.
Collat. Hag. Page 62. Deus ante jacta mundi fundamenta statuit ex genere
humano eos per Christum salvare qui per gratia^ Spiritus credituri, in eaque
fide et obedientia per eande gratiam essent perseveraturi.

Item ibid. Perseverantes in fide velle servare, est totum and integrum
decretu^ Electionis.

Item Page 90. Decretum praecisum, and absolutum, quo Deus dicitur in eligendo
non aliter considerasse hos, aut illos, quam ut personas singulares, neque
respexisse ad bonas cujusqua^ qualitates, quas ante praevidit, non potest vel
cum natura Dei, vel cu^ Scripturis consistere.

Arm. contr. Perk. page 221. Negat Electionem divinam esse regulam fidei
dandae, vel non dandae.

Collat. Hag. page 38. Fatemur aperte fide^ in consideratione atque intuitu Dei
priorem esse electione ad salute^, and non ea^ instar fructus alicujus co^sequi.

2 De Electorum numero incerto.
SEMIPEL.
Prosp. Epist. ad Aug. Non acquiescebant, praedestinatum Sanctorum numerum nec
augeri posse, nec minui.

Epist. Hilar. Arelatens. ad Aug. Illud pariter non accipiunt, ut eligendorum,
rejiciendorumque esse definitum numetum velint.

Faustus. Non esse hominum alios ad vitam, alios ad perditionem deputatos; sed
de salute ad perditione^, and de perditione transiri posse ad salutem.

ARMIN.
Grevinchov. These. exhibit. page 137. and Remonstr. alii. Electio incompleta
potest interrumpi, ac interdum interrumpitur: suntque incomplete electi vere
quidem electi; sed possunt fieri reprobi, ac perire: numerusque electorum
potest augeri, ac minui.

Idem ibid. Nemo in hac vita est peremptory electus, sed ille demum
peremptory eligitur, qui moritur, vel mortuus est in fide, and obedientia.

3 De universalitate Gratiae, and vocationis.
SEMIPEL.
Ex Prosperi Epist. ad Aug. Tom. 7. Ad salutis donum omnes homines
universaliter vocari, five per naturalem, sive per legem scriptam, sive per
Euangelicam praedicationem.

ARMIN.
Arnold. cont. Til. page 397. Deus per Spiritum in lege efficacem in omnibus
aliquo modo and gradu operatur, hoc fine, ut ad fidem Christi omnes paullatim
perducat: quem Deus ex part sua paratus est omnibus revelare.

4 De Operibus praeparatoriis.
SEMIPEL.
Propos. 1. Initium fidei, and conversionis desiderium est ex nobis:
incrementum a gratia.

Ex Prospero. Etiam post praevaricationis lapsum mansisse in Adam -- quaedam
virtutum semina omni animae beneficio Creatoris inserta.

Cavendum est nobis, ne ita ad Dominum omnia Sanctorum merita referamus, ut
nihil, nisi id quod malum atque perversum est, humanae ascribamus naturae.

Ideo homo accipit, invenit, intrat, quia bono naturae been usus, ad istam
salutarem gratiam initialis gratiae open meruerit pervenire.

Propos. 2. Homo si non semper, saltem aliquando praevenit Deum praeparatione
propriae voluntatis: quo naturae conatu movetur Deus, ut voluntatem ita
praeparatam auxilio Spiritus Sancti ad regenerationis gratiam perducat.

ARMIN.
Arnold. page 403. Homo in statu corruptionis habet reliquias vitae
spiritualis, scilicet -- in affectu ad bonum cognitu^ aliquale desiderium.

Armin. cont. Perk. 137. Falsum est, hominem non regenitum totum esse carnem,
hoc est, nihil in illo esse, nisi carnem.

Arnol. page 158. Hoc pacto gratia sua (i. lumine naturae, ut prius patet)
utenti Deum plura and majora dona largiturum sentit Arminius.

Remonstrantes contra Walachros. page 45. Per naturalem legis notitiam, and
meliorem gratiae communis usum correctos, nonnihil idoneos judicat Deus, quos
ulteriore gratia, idque ex been placito suo, donet.

De hi^ vide plura in Pelagianismo. Arto. 3.

5 De liberate arbitrii in conversione.
SEMIPEL.
Epist. Hilar. ad. Aug. Arbitrium ad hoc liberum asserunt, ut velit, vel nolit
admittere medicinam.

Ex Prospero. Quantum autem ad arbitrii libertatem, ab his vitam apprehendi,
qui sponte crediderint, and auxiliu^ gratiae merito credulitatis exceperint.

Faustus. Dei miserationis est, ut vocentur homines: sed ipsorum voluntati
commissum est, ut sequantur.

Petrus Diaconus cont. Faustum. Frustra garriunt, qui dicunt, Meum est velle
credere, Dei autem gratiae est adjuvare: cum ipsum credere nobis a Deo dari
testetur Apostolus.

Cassianus. Non esse ita totum tribuendum gratiae, quin aliqua laus industriae
sit servanda libero arbitrio.

Item, Duo sunt, quae humanam operantur salutem, Dei gratia, and hominis
obedientia.

Faustus lib. 1. Dictum Christi, Nemo venit ad me, nisi Pater traxerit, ita
exponit, ut nihil aliud sit attrahere, nisi praedicare, scripturarum
consolationibus excitare, increpationibus deterrere, desideranda proponere,
intentare metuenda, judicium comminari, praemiu^ polliceri.

ARMIN
Arnold. page 337. Gratia non ita instruit hominem novis viribus, quin semper
maneat in hominis potestate iis uti, vel non uti.

Collat. Hag. page 282. Potest homo regenerationem suam impedire, etiam tum,
cum Deus vult hominem regenerare.

Arnold. adv. Bogerm. p. 263. Positis omnibus gratiae operationibus, quibus
Deus ad conversionem utitur, manet tamen ista conversio in hominis potestate,
ut seipsum possit vel convertere, vel non co^vertere, credere, vel non credere.

Armin. page 223. Totalis caussa, cur hic credat, ille non credat, est voluntas
Dei, and liberum arbitrium hominis.

Arnold. contr. Til. Page 136. Absurdum non est, ut homo sua voluntate se
discernat a no^ credente.

Collat. Hag. page 315. Discretio sui ab alio potest homini tribui.

Grevinchovius contra Am* page 297. Nihil obstat, q ^^ minus vel sola moralis
gratia homines animales reddat spirituales.

Armin. contra Perk. p. 223. Fides ita est merae voluntatis Dei, ut voluntas
illa non utatur omnipotenti et irresistibili motione ad fide^ ingeneranda^ in
hominibus: sed leni suasione, and accommodata ad movendam voluntatem hominis
pro modo libertatis ipsius.

Item page 220. Gratiae author statuit per gratiam suam homines ad assentiendum
leni and suavi suasione movere: qui motus liberi arbitrii liberum consensum non
modo non tollat, sed stabiliat etiam.

Collat. Hag. pa. 291. Annon nobilissima actio circa hominem, quae fit per
inductionem and monelas? Annon satis vehemens foret operatio, si ralis esset,
quali Satanas utitur?

6 De Perseverantia.
SEMIPEL.
Propos. 3. Ad perseverantiam in fide and gratia non opus est nova and speciali
gratia: sufficit ad hoc vel quod natura habemus, vel quod semel per Spiritum
adepti sumus.

Potius sic formanda erat haec sententia.

Ex Aug. de bono Persev. Perseverantiam in finem esse in nostra potestate, and
non esse Dei donum.

Et ex Hilario ad Aug. Nec cuiquam talem dari perseverantiam, a qua non
permittitur praevaricari, sed a qua possit sua voluntate deficere.

Minus candide obtrusa haec propositio pro statu questionis, nedu^ integrae, de
Persevera^tia. Neque enim negaru^t Semipelagiani novae gratiae auxiliu^ ad
perseverantiam: prout constat ex Prosperi verbis prius citatis, nempe, Qui in
ea fide, quae deinceps per Dei gratiam juvanda sit, mansuri.

ARMIN.
Collat. Hag. Page 62. Partis ultimae. Perseverantia male vocatur donum. -- Est
voluntatis actus, quae motionem and actionem Spiritus potest admittere, vel eam
spernere.

Remonstrant. These. exhibit. Synod. Dordr. Positis omnibus, quae ad
perseverandum necessaria and sufficientia sunt, manet tamen semper in hominis
potestate perseverare, vel non perseverare.

7 Decantata Objectio.
SEMIPEL.
Prosp. de voc. Gent. Dicunt superflue ad acquirenda bonorum* operum merita
laborari; frustra etiam orationibus, quibus Deus exorandus paratur, insisti, si
ex incommutabili proposito ejus Christianae gratiae subsistat electio.

Prosp. in Epist. ad Aug. Dicunt lapsis curam resurgendi adimi, and Sanctis
occasione^ teporis afferri, eo quod electi nulla negligentia possint excidere
quoquo modo se egerint.

-- Removeri omnem industria^, tollique virtutes, si Dei constitutio humanas
praeveniat voluntates.

Aug. de bono Persever. c. 12. Pelagiani nobis objiciunt, quod fato tribuamus
Dei gratiam. Vide Aug. ad Bonifa. l. 1. c. 5.

Prosp. ibid. Sub hoc Pr^destinationis nomine fatalem quandam induci
necessitatem.

ARMIN.
Collat. Hag. de 5. Art. p. 12. partis ult. Doctrina ista in se, and ex se,
verae pietati, and bonis moribus officit, tum iis qui eam docent, tum iis, qui
eam audiunt.

-- Movet ad securitatem carnalem, verum dolorem ex commissis peccatis aufert,
simulq^ue sollicita^ illam curam resurgendi ex peccatis, et metum, ne quis
tractu temporis in peccato obduretur.

-- Tollit preces, obsecratines, obtestationes, commonefactiones, minas,
promissiones, mandata, consilia, laudationes, and praemia.

utrosque in eundem Parallelismi carcerem compingit, his verbis,

Paria sunt unius seminis germina, and, quod latebat in radicibus, manifestatur
in fructibus. Non ergo cum istis nova acie dimicandum est; nec quasi contra
ignotos hosts specialia sunt ineunda certamina. Tunc istorum machinae fractae
sunt, tune in superbiae sociis and principibus corruerunt, quando beatae
memoriae Innocentius nefandi erroris capita Apostolico mucrone percussit,
quando Pelagium ad proferendum in se suosque sententiam Palestinorum
Episcoporum Synodus coarctavit.

Deforme hoc Monstrum si constringamus nexu Syllogistico: ligatus Proteus
arcanum effundet oraculum.

Semipelagianismus est verus Christianismus (non diffitente Arminio)

At Semipelagianismus est Pelagianismus (statuente Prospero)

Ergo Pelagianismus est verus Christianismus (vel reclamante Catholicismo)

Quo cum epiphonemate desinit hic noster Parallelismus.
