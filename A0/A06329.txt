A Sermo^d spoken before the king his majesty at Grenwiche, upon good
friday: the year of our Lord.M.CCCCC xxxvj. by Johan Longlo^d byshope of
Lincoln.

Ad laudem and gloriam Christi, and ad memoriam gloriosae passionis eius.

ET IPSE REDIMET ISRAEL ex omnibus iniquitatibus eius. Psalm. 129.
This day which we do solempnyse and keep holy in remembrance of the te^dre,
paynfull, and most glorious passion of our savior Jesus Christ, is called the
good frydaye. And not without a cause. For as upon this day, god did somoche
good for us, that more good cowd not be done. For as upon this day, Christ the
sone of god, suffrede for us, he suffrede passion and death, death of the
cross: the most pa^guyouse, paynfull and cruel death that ever was
suffrede. By which passion and death, he redeemed the world: by which passion
and death, most hyghely he pleased god the fadre, which was from the fall
of Adam unto the time of this passion, utterly displeased with man: by which
passion and death, he reconcyled man to god, and brought him again into favor,
and restored him to grace. And why did god the fadre suffer this his sone, Love
caused the fadre to send his sone to dye for us. E^he. 2.
under this manner to dye? Surely for love, for love that he bare unto us, love
was the cause, love caused him so to do. Propter nimiam charitate^ (says
thapostle) qua dilexit nos deus, cu^ essemus mortui peccatis, co^uiuificauit
nos CHRISTO. For that grette exceeding charytie and love yt the fadre of heaven
loved us with all, where we were sinners and dead in sin: he did quycke^ and
revive us aye^ by his sone Christ. Loo here may you se the cause why god did
this grette good unto us. The apostle says, it was for his grette abundant
charytie, for his marvelous exceeding love: not for our merytes, not for our
deserts, but for love. What love? For the love he bare to him self? Nay, nay.
It was for the inestymable love he bare unto us, Propter nimia^ (inquit)
charitatem qua dilexit nos. What did he by this love? Conuiuificauit nos
CHRISTO. He reuyued us again in Christ, scorn death to life. How? Christo.
In Christ and by Christ. Christ was the doer, in Christ his passion, in
Christ his blood, whose virtue remains in the sacrament of baptism, were
we purged, cleansed, and made holle: not from oon, two, three, or four sins:
but ab oi^bus iniquitatibus nostris. From all our sins, he reuyued us by
this passion, not only from sin, but also from the death yt was due for
sin, from death eternal.

And how did the fadre warke this redempcyo^? In Christo. In Christ, and by
Christ. How by Christ? Roma. 8.
Proprio filio suo non pepercit (says thapostle) sed pro omnibus nobis
tradidit illu^. Quomodo no^ etiam cum illo omnia nobis donauit? This was ye
manner how he wrought our redempcio^, he spared not his own propre sone which
was and is consubstanciall and coeternall with him, of on substance with the
fader, of on being, of on power, of on knowledge: on with him in substance,
on in being, on in power, on in knowledge: in all things oon with the fadre.
Thus his only sone he spared not: but would he should be borne of a virgyne and
become mortal, and to suffer death for us. And that is it that thapostle
says, Pro omnibus nobis tradidit illu^. He gave him for the and for me, and
for this man and for that man. For any moo? Ye Pro omnibus nobis. For us all:
for all man kind. And he says, Tradidit. He did traade and give him. This
tradere, is more than dare. For dare, is to give, but Tradere, is dare in
potestatem. Tradere is to give in to a man's power, to use the thing yt is
given at his or their own pleasures to whom it is given, to do with it even
what they will: as ye will say, to make or mar, to use at liberty. And so
did the fadre of heaven for our sake, he gave his sone Christ into the hands
and power of the Jews, to use him and do with him what they would: to handle:
to treat, to haale, to lugge, to beat, to scourdge, to cut, to mangle, to
crucifye, and cruelly to putto death. And so for this cause Tradidit illum. He
put him holly into their hands for our salvation, to do with him what they
would, and so they did.

And he yt gave us so great a treasure, The fadre gave us with his sone all
goodness.
his own sone, which is his treasure, his wisedo^e, his sapie^ce, his power:
which is ye glory of heaven, in who^e angels does glory, in whom angels
desires to behold, in whose vysage stands ye glory of heaven, the felicitye
and fruicion there: he that gives us so grette a gift, his own sone, will not
stick to give us smaller gifts with this great gift, he will not stycke to
give us all good things with his sone. For he did give to us with him, much
goodenes, much profit, much comfort. He gave to us with him the gift of
faith, ye gifts of hope, charity, pacie^cye, te^perancye, peace,
lo^ganimitye, goodness, benignity, meknes, te^perancy, prudence, wisdom,
chastity, obedience, modesty, contynency, strenghe of soul, good will,
promptitude and redines, a ply aunt good will to live well. He gave with him
Dona spiritus, gifts of the holy gooste. To this man the gift of
understanding, to that man the gift of wisdom, to this man the gift of
pitye, to that man the gift of fear toward god, fortitude and strenghe of
soul to labor in god, to resist sin, to do good deades. He gave us with
this grette gift, grace: grace to be co^trite and repentaunt for our sins,
grace to do penance, grace to morn, weep, and lame^te our wicked lives. He
gives us with his sone, remission of our sins. And will give us ye glory of
heaven with him self, if we will live accordingly and like unto Christianes.
Love caused the sone to dye for man.


And the fadre did not this only of his high charity, thus give his dear
darlynge, his sone for us: but his merciful sone also did give him selffe for
us. Thapostle says. Qui dilexit me, Galat. 2.
tradidit seipsum pro me. He that loved me, did give him self for me. But why
did he so? what had we done for him, that he should so do to us? was it of
our deserts? had we deserved that he should so do? Nay. We were wretched
sinners, we were miserable lyuers, the enemies to god, and out of favor: and
yet he gave himselffe into the hands of his enemies for us. But why did he
so? Certaynely for love. Dilexit me, says thapostle. He loved me. Love was the
cause, love moved and styrred him to give him selffe to the death for us. What
love? The love which I spoke of a fore, the love that he bare to the, to me,
and to all mankind. What gave he for the? Money? gold? precyouse stones?
lands? or goods? Nay. He gave a more precyouse gift than so. Tradidit
scipsum. He gave him selffe. Him self, his body. And not only his body, but
also his soul, his liffe, his death, and his godhede. He gave his body for
the to the Jews, to handle, to treat, to beat, to scourge, to turmoyle, to
kill, to slay, to crucifye, to do with it what they would: and so did they,
even to their own dampnacyo^, he gave so his body in to their hands to redeem
and byethe. He gave for us also his body being a live to the cross, being
dead to the sepulture, that thy body being a live, might live clean: and
being dead, might and should rest in the sepulture, and at that day of god
to rise again, to be gloryfyed and reign with him in glory. He gives to the
aye^ this his most precious body now risen from death to liffe, in that
most holy sacrament of the Euchariste, the sacrament of the aultre. He gives
him selffe unto us, both body and blood: soul, and godhede, now raignynge
in glory and sitting on the right hand of his fadre, Roma, 8.
Vbi postulat pro nobis, as thapostle witnessyth, and is there a petycioner for
us to god the fadre. Christus Jesus qui mortuus est qui and resurrexit, qui est
ad dextera^ dei, interpellat pro nobis. Christ Jesus which dyed, which rysse
from death to liffe, which is on the right hand of the fadre, he makes
peticyon and intercession for us. He daily does show to god the fadre, his
manhood which he took upon him, and the greuouse manner of his death and
passion which he suffrede for us: so to move the fadre to mercy and pytie, so
to procure mercy for man: whose peticyon cannot be contempned but gracyously
hard. Barnard. Christ and Mary his modre, does daily intercede for us to God
ye fadre.


Here says saint Barnard in contemplacio^ of this merciful intercession of
Christ being in dextera patris, Securum habes accessum o homo ad deum, ubi
habes apud patrem, filium intercessore^: apud filium, matrem: matter ostendit
filio, pectus and ubera: filius patri, latus and uulnera: ibi nequit esse
repulsa, ubi tot ostenduntur charitatis insignia. O man thou may surely goo
and sue to thy lord god by petycyon, by desyour and prayour for thy
necessities of soul. Where thou have an intercessour for the. Before the sone,
thou haste his modre Marye. And to procure grace and mercy, to move god to
pytie, she does show to her sone Christ, her breast and pappes: the sone
does show to his fadre, his side and wounds: there can be no repulse, no
denial of our peticions, where are showed and alleged so many tokens of love
and charytie.

The showing of this breast and pappes, What betokens the showinge of ye
breast and pappes of Mary^ and the (...) wondes of Christ.
is no more but a remembrance of the great infinite mercy of god the sone,
which he showed to man, whenne he took manhood for us* borne of a maiden,
being an infant, and suckynge his modres breasts. As who say, that mercy,
that pity and compassion that thou show to man in this doing, show now
unto him in his myserie of sin, have compassion on him, show thyn old
mercy, grant thou him his just peticio^ and humble suyte, remytte his sin,
give him grace, take him to thy favor.

In like manner does god ye sone show to ye fadre his wound in his side, and
his other wounds, to move him to like mercy: which was so merciful to send
down his sone, to suffer these wounds and death for man. Postulat pro nobis,
he makes petition and desyor to the fadre for us. 1. Joan. 1.
Again saint Ioha^ says. Si quis peccauerit, aduocatu^ habemus apud patrem,
Iesum Christu^iustu^, and ipse est propiciatio pro peccatis nostris: no^ pro
nostris tantu^, sed etia^ pro peccatis totius mu^di. If any man by frayltie
does offend and sin let him not despair, for he has an advocate in heaven
before the fadre, his sone Jesus Christ. Aduocatum iustum, a just advocate.
For he prays, not for every sinner that will cry and call and never rise
from sin: but for veraye true penytentes, for them that are displeased with
them selves and with their sin: let the^ cry, let them call, and anon he
callythe with them, and makyth peticyo^ for the^: anon he hears, he helps,
and he then intercedeth to the fadre for them. Iustum, a just advocate, he
promoteth none evil causes. Iustum. He takes no rewards, no gifts, no
brybes. He does not accept any personage but after his living. He regards
not blood nor birth, kythe nor kyne, strength nor wisdom, beawtie nor
fayrenes, riches nor poverty. He regards only the Christian and virtuous
liffe of man. And after his deeds he does accept or repel. Iustum. He is a
just advocate.

Three times Christ prayed for us. Joan. 17.
And three times I read that he did show him selffe a vocate, a peticioner for
us. Ones before his passion, whenne he says to the fadre. Ego pro eis rogo,
non pro mundo, sed pro his quos dedisti mihi, quia tui sunt. I pray for them
and not for the world, I pray for those that thou haste given me, for they be
thyn. Secondaryly in Pater ignosce illis, Luc. 23.
quia nesciunt quid faciunt. Fadre forgive them, they wot not what they do.
Thyrdely after Aduocatum habemus, and caetera. The first intercession was by
word. The soconde was by effusion of his blood. The third is by his daily
showing to the fadre his wounds, so to move him to mercy and pytie, to have
compassion on the world.

Of this grette and infinite charytie writes the apostle Paul in an othec
place sainge. Roma. ^.
Vt quid enim Christus pro impijs mortuus est? uix enim pro iusto quis moritur.
Nam pro bono quis audeat mori? Commendat autem deus charitatem suam in nobis,
quoniam cum adhuc peccatores essemus, Christus pro nobis mortuus est, in cuius
sanguine iustificati sumus, in cuius sanguine salui erimus ab ira. What moved
Christ to dye for wicked sinners? Scante we shall find one that will dye for
a just man. No man will dye for an other, not for his frynde.
And where shall we find him that dare dye for a good man? Our lord god has
showed a commendable and laudable charytie toward us, for where that we were
sinners, wretched lyuers, abhomynable in the sight of god: Christ dyed for us.
In whose blood, we be justified and made rightuouse: in whose blood, we
shall be saved from the ire and wrath of god. Live thou never so well, live
thou never so holyly, let se if thou were in the case now to dye, unless thou
should get one that would dye for the, where should thou have one? where
should thou find him that would do so much for the, by whose death thou
should escape death? Now thou being a sinner, a mysseliuer, let see who
will dye for the? Any one? Not the fadre for the sone, Christ dyed for his
enemies.
not the sone for the fadre. Yet thou being a sinner, an enemy to god: he
dyed for the. Freely, without queste. Freely, not hired, not required, but of his
own, mere, merciful goodenes offrede him selffe thereunto, only for the love
he bare unto the. And that is it the apostle says. Commendat deus charitatem
suam in nobis, quoniam cum adhuc peccatores essemus, and caetera. He showed a
meruelouse laudable charytie to us, in that we being horrible sinners, ye
before we were renate or borne the children of god by baptism, before we were
justified by faith, ye before that we were borne or known to the world,
Mortuus est pro nobis, he diet for us, not required, not desyored, not hired
thereunto: Gala. 5.
but gratis and sine argento redimimini, freely of his own mere mocion, of his
own goodenes, he offrede him selffe voluntarily to the death. In cuius
sanguine iustificati sumus, and caeteta. In whose blood, we be justified,
purged, washed, and made clean. In whose blood we shall be saved at that grette
day from the grette wrath of god, if we live thereafter. That we may be
parteners of this gloryouse passion and blood of Jesus Christ, let us pray.
Oremus. Et ipse redimet Israel ex omnibus iniquitatibus eius. Litera.


The English of these words is, Christ has redeemed Israel from all his
iniquyties*
He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquyties, He shall redeem Israel from
all his iniquyties. Not from a patche or a piece, not from one, two, three or
four iniquyties, but from all. From all there iniquyties, from all there
sins, from oryginall and actual, from venial and deathly, from all. And
whenne the prophet wrote these words, this passion was to come, and therefore
said Redimet, he shall redeem. And now it is paste, and true quod redemit. He
has verily suffrede passion and death, and has redeemed Israel from all
his imiquyties, from all his sins. How and under what manner the fadre did
warke this redempcyon, the prophet shewethe in an other psalm, sainge. Psalm.
^^
Notam fecisti in populis uirtutem tuam, redemisti in brachio tuo populum tuum,
filios Jacob and Joseph. Thou lord god fadre of heaven, thou have declarede,
made open, and manyfestly showed thy virtue emonges thy people. Thou haste
redeemed thy people in thyn arm, Jacob, Joseph quid significa^t?
the children of Jacob and Iosephe. Jacob is called Israel, and signyfieth the
people of Israel, the Israelytes. Joseph is interpretate augmentum sieve
crescens, an augmentacyon or a growing: and signyfieth the gentiles which
were added and joined to the Israelites in faith, and elect to be with them
the veraye people of salvation, and to be redeemed by Christ, for he redeemed
all. In these words, Notam fecisti uirtutem tua^ the prophet shows the
grette power of god which he showed in our redemption, Christ is callid the
virtue, power and wisdom of ye fadre
saying. Thou haste good lord opened and showed* thy power, thy virtue, thy
wisdom unto the world. What is this virtue, power and wisdom of God? The
apostle showed to the Corynthes, 1. Cor. 1.
where he callithe Christum dei uirtutem and sapientiam. He calls Christ
incarnate, ye virtue and wisdom of god the fadre. He is called the virtue and
power of the fadre, the wisdom of the fadre: for by him, the fadre maade the
world of nothing, by him he governs ye world, by him he protecteth,
contynueth, and holds up the world, by him he punyshethe ye world: in
some place one punysheme^t, in some place an other. By him he redeemed and saved
ye world, and by him he shall judge the world. This and all other things,
does the fadre warke by his sone Jesus Christ, which is called his virtue,
his power, and his wisdom. This virtue the sone of god, God was known to the
world or he ca^e to ye prophets, but not to all.
was known to the world many thousand years before he came. For the prophets
almost at the beginning of all, wrote that he should come in to the world,
and that he should be borne of a virgyne, and yt he should rebuke the world
for their sin, and teach truth, and warke miracles, make holle the lame and
sick, cleanse lepres, give sight to ye blind, raysse to life dead bodies,
remytte sin, redeem man: with much more as is open in the books of the
prophets and in the psalms. He came according unto the prophets sainges, and
fulfilled all things written of him by the^, yet would the world not know
him. ^
In mundo erat and mundus per ipsum factus est, and mundus cum no^ cognouit. He
was in the world, ye world was maade by him, and yet the world knew him not.
And so whenne the time was come, written by the prophets, Christ would show
him selffe, and came down from the heuens, conceived by the holy ghost, borne
of a virgyne, taking very manhood upon him, Angell^ shepar^des, ye ore and
ass, ye ster, ye.iij. kings, witnessyd Christ to be god.
and began plainly to open him selffe to the world. At which time he sent
his angels to the shepardes watchynge their sheep, gyuynge to them knowledge
that he was borne and comen in to the world. The shepardes came to the place
where he was, they saw him there skrawlynge and liynge in a crybe between an ox
and an ass. He sent an other testymony from ye heue^s that he was come, a
flamynge sterre, to monyshe the three kings of the Este partys of the world, to
testyfye his coming. They came to him from far countries. They offrede to
him, gold, myrre, and sens as to their lord and god. He showed him selffe
at.xij. years of age in the temple disputynge there with doctors and learned men
of their laws, proving and showing by the sayenges of their own prophets,
that god was borne and come^ in to the world. And yet the world knew him not
^ yet he was to ye world Deus absconditus. A hyde god, not known.' And to
show him selffe more openly, he went out of Nazareth and Galyley into
Jordan, to be baptized of Johan baptiste, Ioha^ baptiste witnessyd Christ to
be god.
which Johan knew him to be god, of a mekenes did utterly refuse the thing,
judging him selffe to be far unworthy to touch his master Christ, which
was veraye god and man: of whom he said before, that he was not worthy to
vnlachet, nor to beir his shoys. Math. 3.
And said to Christ, Ego debeo a te baptizari, and tu uenis ad me? I ought to
be baptized of the lord god, and thou come to me? O lord what meaneste thou?
Thou that purgest the world, thou that washeste all, commeste thou to me to be
washed? I thy creature, and thou my creator? I thy servant and thou my
master? I a sinner and thou he that purges sin? I ought to be washed of
the and thou come to be washed of me? O Lord god what means this? Christ
answerede., Sine modo, sic enim decet nos implere omne^ iustitia^. Ioha^,
Johan, Christ taught ye world to submitt them selfs to the sacrame^tis of his
church.
suffer at this time, thou know not the mysterye of this thing, thou
know not what this thing means. For under this manner, it besemeth us to
fulfill all justice, all justice id est omne^ humilitate^, al humylite. Here
christ taughtt all ye world humblye to submytte them selves, unto the
sacraments of his church, what degree so ever they be of: ye and to fulfill
all virtue to him belo^gyng. For this justice co^teyneth in him self all
virtue, as says saint Ambrose. Vbi iusticia, ibi cunctarum uirtutum
concordia. Ambrosius. The fadre and ye holy ghost witnessid Christ to be God.
Where justice is, there is an unity, a concord, a gadrynge to gether of all
virtues. And so did Johan obey his masters will, and baptized him. And then
did the fadre of heaven open and manyfeste his sone Christ to the world. Not
only by the warkes of Christ, but also by testymonye of his own word. For
whe^ne Christ was thus baptized, and went out of the water, Math. ^.
the heuens opened, the holy ghost descended in a corporal likeness of a dove,
and stude upon him. The fadre spoke from heaven with a loud voice, saying. Hic
est filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi co^placui. And Mathewe writing of his
transfiguracyon, added more and seyde, Ipsum audite. Matthew. 17.
This is mine entere beloved sone, this is mine veraye sone. Math. 17.
Filius meus dilectus, mine own beloved sone in whom I delight, here him. He
shall teach the world, he shall preach truth, Ipsum audite, here him. He
shall prove him selffe to be very god, he shall prove by his warkes, to be the
veraye prophet that shall save ye world. He shall redeem man, he shall
remytte sin, he shall send down the holy gooste, he shall judge ye world:
Ipsum audite, here him, follow him, obey his word, keep his commandments,
follow that he byddeth you follow, do that he byddeth you do, he is my sone,
Ipsum audite, here him. What more testimonye need we to have of Christ to
prove him to be the savior of the world then this? then the testimonye of the
fadre? the testimonye of the holy ghost, his own warkes and wonders? Here was
open wytenes, here was prove enoughe, to prove that he was the sone of god. And
yet he was as Esaias does say, ye hid god, unknown to the world. Vere tu es
deus absconditus, Esaie. 45. Deus absconditus. The hidd God.
inquit. Thou art the hid god, hid unto the world not known to man, the
world yet would not know him.

For as it is open in Mathewe, After that Christ was baptized and went into
wyldernes, there ouercomynge the grette enemy of man ye devil by that again
proving him selffe to be god: and after went abroad all Iudee, declarynge him
selffe as well by his living, his preaching, as by miracles doing, to be
veraye god, as Nichodemus said unto him, Joan. 5.
Nemo potest haec signa facere quae tu facis, nisi fuerit deus cu^ eo. None
may do these signs yt thou doeste unless god were with him. And yet he was
Deus absconditus mundo. He was god, and hid to the world, not known. Yet to
make him more manyfeste and known to the world, he asked his disciples, Quem
dicu^t homines esse filium hominis? What does ye world say of Christ? Math.
16
who^e does they call him? They answered, Some does call the Johan baptiste,
some calls the Helyas, some Heremye or one of the prophets. Christ said,
whom do you call me? Simon Petre answered. Tu es Christus filius dei uiui.
Peter did witness Christ to be God.
Thou art Christ the sone of the living god. Loo, here was an other
testimonye and witness that he was god.

Again it was prouyd that he was god, in his transfiguracion in the mount of
Thabor: whenne he showed him self glorious between Moses and Helyas, to Petre,
James, and Ioha^: they herynge the fadre from heaven raynge as before, Hic est
filius meus dilectus, and caetera. Where Petre desyored ever to dwell there,
thinking he had been in heaven and said. Domine bonum est nos hic esse:
faciamus tria tabernacula: tibi unu^, Mosi unum, and Heliae unum. Petre saw
such a glory, yt he desired to a bydde there and never to return again unto ye
world. Christ witnessyd of him self, to be God, by his works Joan. 5.
Christ many ways she wyd him to be god cheffly in his passion resurrection and
ascencion. Virtus dei. Christ is callid the power of God, the wisdom, the arm
and ye right hand. Brachium dei.

The arm of god


And christ in an other place wytnessed hymselffe yt he was god, openly saying
to ye Jews, Opera quae ego facio, testimoniu^ per hibent de me* Remyttynge
them to his warkes, yt by his warkes and miracles, they moughte verily know
what he was. My warkes said he, does wytenes what I am. And emo^ges all his
warkes, he cheffely proved hymselffe to be god, by the warkes he showed in his
passion, by ye warkes he did in our redemption. In this passion, he showed and
plainly opened him selffe, and gave euydent notes and knowledge to the world,
that he was veraye god. In this passion he showed him selffe to be Virtus and
sapientia patris, to be the virtue and power, the sapie^ce and wisdom of the
fadre. In this passion, the fadre would the truth thereof should be showed and
openly known. Here in this passion Notam fecit dominus in populis uirtutem
suam. He showed his virtue: he showed openly to his people, yt this his sone
was his virtue: and that by this his sone and by his passion, he would warke
virtue, and that the redemption of man should be wrought by him, by his passion
and death, and by his precyouse blood which shuldbe shed in the same. And
that is it that follows in the same verse. Redemisti in brachio populum tuu^.
Thou haste in thine arm, redeemed thy people.

What is this arm of ye fadre? Ueryly ye, that before he called Virtutem, his
virtue, Christ his sone. For in an other psalm ye prophet says. Sed
dextera tua and brachiu^ tuu^, Psalm. 43. Three names of Christ, dextera /
brachiu^ / illuminatio. Dextera dei.

The rigt hand of God. (...)


and illuminatio uultus tui, quoniam placuerunt in eis. Where ye prophet does
describe Christ by three names. He calls him Dexteram, brachium, and
illuminationem. The right hand, the arm, and the light of the vysage of the
fadre. First he called him Dexteram, the right hand of the fadre. For Christ
incarnate is signyfyed by the right hand. And the reason after Ysodore is, for
that, Dextera dicitur a dando. The right hand is called the right hand of
dando of giuynge, because that of old, the token of peace was and yet is,
given by the right hand. Demus dexteras hominibus istis, said the Machabees.
Let us strike hands with the^, ^
let us give hands each to other, which is a token of truyse and peace. And
the reason may be, for yt the philosopher says. ^
Pars dextra est principium motus, and membra dextera sunt fortiora sinistris.
The right (...) is redi^^ and stro^ge^ than ^s ye lift
In the right side is the origynall beginning of all the mocions and mouynges
of the body: and all the right parties and members on the right side, are
naturally stronger than the lift. For we se the right hand, the right arm,
ye right foot, is more ready in any thing to do, then is the lift. And is
set and goes before ye other almost in all things. And is more qwyuer, more
quyke, more strong and far more ready and apt to the doing of any thing
then is the lift. And we se by experience, whenne friends that has be
long a sondre mete to gether, they take hands to gedre eueryche with other,
not the lift hands, but the right hands. Whenne they also depart, they
bydde fare well and shake hands, not the lift hands, but the right. Whe^ne
they make bargaynes to gether in token of performaunce of there bergaynes, they
strike hands together, not the lift hands, but the right hands. Whenne men
has been at variaunce, and ar again made atone, in token of truyse and
peace, they take hands together, not lift hands, but ye right hands. So
forasmoche as the righthande, is the chief hand ye man warketh with, and is more
ready, more ha^some and stronger of the two: god ye fadre wrought all, by
Christ his right hand: he governs all, by Christ his right hand: and
shall judge all, by Christ his right hand. And where he was in displeasure
with man, and afterward took truyse and peace with him, in token of a fyrme
peace, he gave man his right hand, his son Jesus Christ. Whe^ne? Uerily
when he sent him down to take our nature upon him: in toke^ that he gave his
strenghe unto us, and would no more strike us with that hand unless he be to
fare prouok^d. Of this hand writes the prophet in an other psalm, Psalm.
6^. Dextera dei.

The righthand of godde se^dith us


saying Me suscepit dextera tua. Thy right hand took me. Thou tokest me with
thy right hand. Whenne? Surely whenne thy son Christ took my nature,
whe^ne thy sone took me into his favor, whenne thy sone made ye grette peace
between the and mankind. He took me, he took me then into his protection, to
defend me, to protecte me, and to save me in all persecucions, in all
temptacio^s and suggestions that we are here daily troubled with by the devil
and his angels: by the world, and by our own frail fleshy body. Whedre itt
be in fleshly desiour, in carnal affection, in worldely vanitye, in arrogancye
or pride, in malice or displeasur, in inordinate desiour of lucre, in gule or
luxus lyuinge, or any other inordinate behavior. For every way the devil
assauteth us hy his craftye subtle means. Every way he assay the how he
may over throw us by his temptacions which are so secrette, so sotle, so
craftye, so busye, so importune, so manyfolde, so hydly done, and so vehement:
that and this hand do not help us, itt lies not in us to resist. We live
here in continual persecution. We have here continually inward an spiritual
enemies: vut being strong in God, being strong in faith, in hope, and in
love of him: we need not to fear. For the devil is but weak where the power
of God is. Dominus fortis est and pote^s, Psalm. 2^
dominus potens in praelio. God is mighty, strong, and of infinite power.
God is strong, God is full of might and power, strong and mighty in
batell, mighty in power, mighty in creation, mighty in protection of these
that apperteynithe unto him: mighty in governance, mighty in redemption.
Mighty to do all things, in heaven, in earth, and in hell, as shall appear in
the process. God the fadre gave therefore this his right hand, his sone, unto
us: in sign and token of peace, and of truyse. And in token thereof, the angels
at this truyse making, at the coming of christ first into this world,
Luc. 2.
sange, Gloria in excelsis deo, et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.
Glory be to God in heaven, and peace be to all men in earth that are of good
will. So that ye gyuinge of this right hand Christ, was a suffycient and a
convenient token of peace and attoneme^t taken and made between god and man.

And because we should be the more in assurance of this peace, god the fadre
suffrede this his right hand to be bounden. To be bounden to the pyllour with
ropes, God strykyth sometime with his right hand, and sometime with his left hand.
to the cross with nails. If thou therefore do fear the justice and
severity of God, hold him fast by the right hand. If then he stryke the,
itt shall be with the left hand, and shall be but an easy stroke. He strikes
with the left hand whenne he punishes temporally. Whenne he strikes thy
body with plage or syckenes, with infirmity or disease, with trybulacyon or
aduersytye. He stryketh with his left hand, whenne he takes away thy wyffe,
thy husband, thy child, thine heir, thy goods, thy worldely comfort that
thou haddeste so much pleasure in. Thou haddeste so much pleasure in these
things, that it pulled thy love and heart, thy service and feoty from God:
whereby, thou moughtest have run into eternal dampnacio^. God therefore
stryketh with his left hand, and takes away thyn inordynate love thou
had to this world and worldely things. He takes away the occasion of
thy damnacion. Which taken away, When do the God stryke with his right hand.
(...)
thou may more liberally apply thy love, thy mind, thy service and duty,
toward him. He stryketh with his right hand, whe^ne he stryketh the sinner
with eternal damnation. For itt is written by Solomon. Longitudo dierum in
dextera eius, and in sinistra illius diuitiae and gloria. In his right hand
is that celestial and eternitye of lyffe: to give, or to take away from whom
and to whom he will. And in his left hand, he has this temporal riches
and worldely glory, to dispose, to give or to withdraw, at his pleasure, to
whom and from whom he will. And this stroke is called, but a touch, a
philippe, a tryfull as ye will say in comparison of the the other. Manus domini
tetigit me, says Job. Job. 19. The hand of God is dradfull, and to be fearyd
The hand of god has touched me. Whenne said he so? Uerily whenne the
Sabeis violently took from him five hundrede yoke of oxen, five hu^drede
asses. whe^ne the Chaldeis took from him four thousa^de Camels, whenne they
slew his seruaundes, whenne a vehement wind came and ouerthrewe the house
where his children were, being merye eatinge and drinkinge, and slew them.
Whenne a flamynge fire came from above, and brante his seven thousand sheep
with their kepers. Whenne his own body was stryken with soores and plages so
grievously, that no part of his body was untouched: but all soore, all foul,
all filthy, all materouse, noisome and ogle to behold. This hand straake

from his realm into deserte where he liuyd.vij. years and a half eatinge

grase and hay with beestis. And all this and such other temporal
punyshmentes, are called but Tactus manus domini, the touching of the hand of
god. But whenne he stryketh, he stryketh soore. When he strykyth, he stryketh
with the right hand: of which stroke the prophet speaks in his psalm,
Percussit inimicos suos in posteriora: obprobrium sempiternum de dit illis. He
has stryken his enemies, the grett sinners of the world and there posteritye
yt does foloo them in there sin and yt is he says Percussit inimicos in
posteriora. Psalm. 77. 1, Regu^. 56
And there has they Obprobrium sempiternum, everlasting shame, obprobry and
pain. And a yen the same prophet says, Psalm. 20.
Dextera tua inueniet omnes quite oderunt Thy right hand lord god shall
find all those that does haate the, all those yt has neglected thy
commau^deme^tes, al those yt has despised thy precepts, yt has contempned
thy laws and ordinances that are disobedient unto the. But whe^ne shall he
thus find them? And how shall he find the^? verify, Ibidem. The dradfull hand
of God.
Quando ponet eos ut clibanum ignis in tempore uultus sui, quando in ira sua

suffer, suffer damnation eternal.

and go not from him. How shalt thou bind this hand of God? By deuo^te
prayour, by inteare peticion, by continual intercession, by true faith, by
perfytte hope, by fervent love and charytie, by godly and christian living.
Read ye.xxxii. chapter of Exodi: And there shalt thou see how Moses bound
this hand so fast, Exodi. 32.
that he moughte not stryke. Whenne the Israelytes, (Moses being in the
mount with god and had received the laws) had made them a calfe of gold
and honored itt for their god. God showed it to Moses, saying that he would
therefore destroy them. And Moses maade intercession for his people besekynge
god to spare them. And God said to Moses, Dimitte me, ut irascatur furor meus
contra populum istum ut deleam eum. Moses, said God, Moses, Suffer me, Suffer
me Moses to extend my furye ane^ste these stubburn people. Suffer me to
stryke, Suffer me to destroy them. To whom Moses said, O Lord, O marcyfull
god, Quiescat domine iam ira tua and esto placabilis super malitiam populi,
Lord, cesse thy displeasure, hold thy hand, contented, have compassion on thy
people, forgive them their iniquitye. And itt follows in the lettre. Placatus
est dominus. God was pacyfyed of his displeasure and spared his people at ye
request and instans of Moses. Loo christian people here may you see, how Moses
by prayour, stayde the high displeasure of God, and held him yt he could not
stryke: else would not he have said: o Moses suffer me, Suffer me Moses. Thou
seeste now Good catholic man the grette pythe and virtue of true prayour.

Pray therefore to thy lord god yt he may stay his stroke of vengeance,
that he may be merciful unto the and to his people, yt he may withdraw his
punishynge hand, that he may spare his subjects. Hold him by prayour, bind
him by peticion, pacyfye him by intercession, stay his wrath by intear desyour
and sewte. This hand does punyshe and dampne the sinner: This hand does
save the penytente, this hand does reward the good man, this hand does
crown ye ryghtuouse person in the heue^s. And yff we live well and christianely
this right hand shall defend, protecte, guyyd, and save us: so yff we live
not christianely, itt shall punyshe, Christ is callid ye arm of God. Brachium
destroy, and utterly dampne us. This sone of God is not only called dextera
the right hand of god the fadre: but is also called Brachium the arm of the
fadre. Which word brachium in scripture is many times taken Pro potentia and
fortitudine, for power and strenghe, and for the sone of god. For the first
part, Videlicet de potentia and fortitudine, Psalm. ^8.
itt is written Tu humiliasti sicut uulneratum superbum. In bra chio uirtutis
tuae dispersisti inimicos tuos. Thane thou lord god, thou haste brought ye
proud man as low, as a man that is woundid. And haste skaterd and dispersyd
thyn enemies in the arm of thy virtue, in thy sone. And as God does bring
down by this hand and arm the proud wretched sinner, and disperse and putto
flighte his enemies: so does he again with his hand exalte, extol and promote
his humble seruandis, though not at all times in this world, yett he will do
itt in heaven, Where he will auanus him with the felicity and sight of god,
And that is itt that before the prophet calls, Illuminatio uultis tui the
clear sight of the godhede. Wherein stands ye heavenly joy, the felicity
and glory of the fruycyon there. Here now apperithe the grette virtue and power
of this hand and arm of God. When that he in his passion did dysparge,
conuicte and utterly overcome all his enemies, death, sin, and the devil,
and has spoiled the helles, and victoriously rose from the death to lyff.
Sic notam fecit dominus uirtutem suam. So under this manner, god has showed and
opened to the world his virtue, his wysdom, his hand, his arm, his power,
his omnipotency, his sone Jesus Christ. And especially emo^ges all other
things, he declared him self to the world, to be veraye god by his dolorouse
passion.

Did not he show and prove him self to be veraye god in his grette soper and
maundye? Christ by his passion every way^ declary^ hymsel^^ to be god
whe^ne he showed the secrettes of Judas mind and purpose de traditione, how
he should betraye him? whe^ne he gave him self, his own veraye body and
blood, to his disciples in form of bread and wine, to eat and drink? did
not he show himself to be veraye God whenne he in his prayour upon the
mount, swette both water and blood? Whenne he did prostrate and ouerthrewe
the Jews with a word? Who can tell the secrettes of man's heart but oonly God?
Who can give his body in form of bread and his blood in form of wine but
oonly god? who can sweet blood with water but god? who ca^ overthrow an
army of men with a word but God?

Judas was ouertrowen.
Whenne Christ met Judas with a grette multitude of the Jews with lanterns,
torches, fire brandes and other lyghtes: with staves, swords, with other
wepons, and in armure, to apprehende and take him, and knew him not whenne
they met him, for that god had taken away their knowledge: and Christ
asked them, Quem queritis? whom seek you? They answered Iesum Nazarenum. Joan.
1^.
We seek Jesus of Nazareth. And Christ said, Ego sum. I am, At which word,
Judas and they all stayde, went back and fell to the earth. He pausyd a
lyttyll, and suffrede them a yen to rise. He asked them a ye^, whom seek you?
They answerede, Jesus of Nazarethe. Christ said, did not I tell you, Quia ego
sum? That I am he? If ye seek me, suffer these my disciples to goo saaf, un
touchid, hurt the^ not. And so put him self voluntarily into his enemies
hands, and saved his disciples. For he had said before to his fadre, Quos
dedisti mihi, Joan. 1^.
non perdidi ex eis quenque. I have not lofte oon of those that thou haste
given me to keep, butt have preserved them all.

He showed himself to be god thus in his taking whenne he was apprehended.
Also in healynge Malchus, whose ear was cut of from his hedde by Peter. He
proved him self God in all his words, in all his behauyours, in all his
doings, in all his answers made before the judges, and in his meruelouse
pacie^cy, showed both before them and the Jews, whenne he was scourged, when
he was beaten, when he was bound to a pyller, crowned with thorn, blyndfeld
bobbed, and when he was every way most cruelly entretyd. Which he could not
have done yff he had not been god, And yet the world knew him not. Yett was
he to the world, Deus absconditus, a hyyd good. And how by farther process in
his passion, did show him self more plainly to the world, itt shall appear
by a breue epylogacion and rehersall of ye same. For yff we do call well to
our remembrance (as we ought to do) how effectuously, how compe^diously,
and with how breue, Triano tanda.

Three things to be notyd in this passion of Christ.


how pythy and effectual words, the four evangelists has with a maruelouse
dyligencie truly and faythefully gadrede and written this passion of our
savior christ: we shall find the same most preciouse passion to stand
princypally in three things: which does instruct and teach us three
necessary lessons, for our souls health.

The first part of his passion, 1. Christ was spolyd of his garments and
maad nakyd.
stood In rerum suarum ablatione and corporis denudatione, in yt his clothes
were taken from him and he left naked. For after he had been brought
before so many judges, where he was deryded, accused, and by false testimonye
condemned to death, to the death of ye cross: he was first scourged,
beat, and bare his cross thorough ye City, to ye place of passion called
Golgatha in the mount of Caluary: where the Jews which were appointed to putt
him on the cross, spoiled him from all that he had, from his clothes and
from his apparel. They took all from him, and left him bare and naked
without ragge or bratte, annethe they left upon him femoralia, any clothe
about the neither parts of his body. And if they left somoche as that upon
him, we read itt not in the Gospel. Nor yett we read that any thief or
malefactor has been so nakydly spoiled, so nakydly left whenne he should
suffer, as Christ was whenne he should dye. For they took from him not oonly
his outeward apparel, but also they spoylyd him of his secrette coote, and
took from him, tunica^ inconsu tilem, a coote which was without seem,
which cote they would not deuyd as they did his other garmentis, but cast
lotte who should have it hoole. Psalm. 23.
Diuiserunt sibi uestimenta mea, and super uestem meam miserunt sortem. They
divided emo^ges them my garmentis, and cast lotte upon ye oon coote said God.
Loo man, See how thy lord god was thus ignomyniously left naked and baare,
and cried not at itt, grudged not with itt, murmured not for hy^. He
Complained not, but suffrede, and patiently held his peace, wherein we
Christian people be taught to remember paciencie in our adversity, to
remember, Job. 1.
Quod nihil in hunc mundum intulimus, nec qui^que auferre possumus. That we
brought nothing in to this world with us, nor shall bear any thing away
whenne we shall depart. The same Job sayethe, Nudus egressus sum de uentre
matris meae, and nudus reuertar. Idem. Rich (...) pour cu^myth nakyd in to
this world* and nakydly shall depart.
I was borne and came into this world baare and naked, and baare and naked I
shall go from itt. Be all folkys so borne? does all folkis so baarly go owte?
be all borne naked and baare? Ar Emperors and Kings borne naked? and goo
nakyd out? Ye both Emperors and kings, Queen's and ladies, lords and
gentylme^, rich and poor. All, All, All are born nakyd and baar, and as
baarely shall they again depart this world? Baare, naked, without clowte or
clothe: unless itt be that the grette man shall percase have a fyner wynding
shete then shall the poor man, but both be mortal, both shall dye, both
shall rotte, both shall be forgoten, both be Terra and cinis, ^
puluis and esca uermium, quos hereditabunt serpe^tes. This fair body of thyn
yt you makeste somoche of, yt you dekkest so p^ciously, yt you settyste somoche
by: itt shall away, itt is butt terra and cinis, puluis and esca uermiu^ It is
but earth, ashes, duste, and worms meat. Serpents haereditabunt illud.
Serpents shall enheryte thy body, as thou doeste naturally enheryte thy fadre
his lands. Even so serpentis, worms and toodes, shall enheryte thy body.
Serpents, worms, and toodes, shall naturally ingendre and bread of thy body.
Serpents, worms, and toodes, shall gnawe, eat, and devour thy beawtyfull
face, thy fair nose, thy clear eyes thy white hands, thy gudly body.
Remember this thou lord and laid. Remember this thou Christen man and woman.
Remember this ones a day. Quia nunque peccat, qui se semper cogitat mo
riturum. He shall never sin deadly, that ever has in remembrance that he
shall dye. He yt will therefore overcome this frail world, let him leave the
delectacion thereof, Et nudus cum nudo Christo crucem ascendat. And let him
nakedly with naked Christ, Let him poorly with poor christ, ascend and goo
up upon the cross. And how? I shall anon show the.

.2. How Christ was contemnid and derydyd.
The second part of this passion, stood In summo contemptu and irrisione: in
grette horrible contempt and derisio^, which yt Jews put Christ unto. I
think no earthely man ca^ rehearse ye oon part of the manifold and open
contemptuouse derysions, obprobryes, mockes and scorns, which they did unto
Christ as upon this night paste and this day: reputing and taking him for
a spectacle, for a mocking stock, Spectaculu^ quid?
for a malefactor, for a contemptuouse person, and for an abbreacher of the
law. For whenne they came to take him, they came as Christ him self
witnessythe, Marc. 14.
Tanque ad latronem existis cum gladiis and lignis comprehendere me. Whenne ye
came to take me, ye came as the manner is to take a theffe: with armure, with
swerdes and battes, in the night time. And whenne I was daily emonges you in
the temple teaching, ye took me not, ye laid no thing to my chardge. Thus
vylenously they took Christ, they lugged him to and froo: they struck him,
they buffetted him, they bound him, they pulled him by ye hear, they spytte
upon him, they gave him buffattes and strokes to to beyond home. They scourged
him with out pytye or compassion, they clothed him in purple color in derisio^,
they crowned him with thorn, they blyndefelde him, they mocked him, they put
in his hand a reed in stedde of a cepture, And in mockage struck him by
course, and cried, Tell us who stryketh the now. And likewise struck him
about the hedde, cryynge, tell us now who struck the? swapte him upon ye
face, cryynge who was yt struck the now? who was that? And kneled down before
him salutynge him in derision, cryinge, Aue rex iudaeorum, Aue rex iudaeorum.
Hayle king of Jews, Hayle king of Jews. As so say, thou take thy self
to be king of Jews, and now thou art served like a king, now thou art
crowned, now you haste a ceptre in thy hand, now thou syttest in thy throne,
in purpul colors, Now we honor thefor our king, Aue rex iudaeorum, Hayle
king of Jews. Undre this manner outragiously and beyond all estymacyo^ of man,
they deryded and mockyd him.

The insaciable cruelty of the Jews.
And yett not being this content, they had him forth again in praetorium, into
the ye yeldhall before Pylate, never ceasynge but cried, Judge him, condemn
him to the death, he is gyltie and wurthy to dye, let him be crucified, let
him be hanged upon the cross: let him dye a shame full death, deliver unto
us Barrabas and condemn Jesus. Pylate hyring this raage, Answered I find no
cause in him why he ought to dye. Take you him and crucifye him for I ka^ not.
They said a yen, we have a law, and after our law he ought to dye. And yff
thou let him thus goo, thou art not friend unto Cesare. Whenne Pylate hard
that, he sat down, he gave judgment and sentens anenst Christ, he committyd
him to their hands to crucyfye. They took him, they put of his purple
garment, and put on again his own apparel, yt he might the better be known to
ye Jews, to his shame and rebuke. They putt a grette hudge cross upon his
back, they led him and haalyd him through the city, they brought him to
the place of execution, they gave him aysell and gall to drink. They faryd so
ungoodly with him, that I think the Evangelists (which were most discrete
and soobur in their pen) would not for shame express all the ungoodly and
shameful manner of their ludibryes, of their wicked behauiours in this behalf
toward Christ. But with as breue, pure and chaste pen as they could they
expressed, not the nombre of their evil doings, but only in part expressid
Modum and formam, the manner and fasshyon of their doings, of their derysions
and conuiciouse words, of there outrageous behauyours toward Christ. So under
this manner was christ our savior on every be halffe skornefully and
mokkyshely handlede, unmercifully treatyd: In such wise, as the prophet Esaias
does say. Vidimus eum, Esaie. 5^
and non erat in ipso nec species, nec decor, tanque nouissimu^. Reputauimus
^um quasi leprosum and percussum a deo, and humiliatum. We looked upon him, and
there appeared another beawty nor favor in him, but as a man out cast of all
men. We reputed him as a lepur, as a man out of the favor of God, as a man
most vile in reputacion, and as an abiectt of the world. The pacyency of
Christ. Ibidem.


And what did he in all this trouble, in all thies turmuyllys? hitt follows.
Sicut ouis ad occisionem ducitur, and quasi agnus coram tondente obmutuit, non
aperiens os suum, In all this aduersitye, he used himself like unto ye
propertye of a sheep, which whenne he is brought to the shamuls to be slain,
And likewise the lamb that is under the hand of him that does shere him, The
sheep cries not, the lamb complayneth not: ye sheep is put to death and
strogleth not, the lamb loses his fleese and some times a piece of his skin
and flesh, and yet complayneth not. So Christ, in all these his pangnes, in
all these his pains and iniuryes, rebelled not, complained not, murmured not:
but pacie^tly as a lamb suffrede all such iniures, wro^ges and payns that the
Jews did putt unto him. Wherein we be taught, patiently to suffer all
obprobryes, all iniuryes, wrongs, or dyspleasures done unto us by our enemies,
in the cause of God. Patiently to suffer hytt for the name and love of God,
which suffrede so many wrongs, so many Iniuryes and rebukes for us. Of this
virtue of patience itt is written, Eccle. 1.
Vsque ad tempus sustinebit paciens, and postea erit redditio io cunditatis
illius. The pacient man suffrethe for a while, till the time yt God shall
reward all things good and badde: and then shall he have his reward of
joy and gladness therefore. So now the seruaundes of god suffrethe derisio^s,
rebukes, wrongs, iniuryes, trybulacion, reproach, aduersytye, sykenes,
infyrmytyes, hungre, famyne, thyrste, pouertye, myserye, dysdayne as men
utterly abiecte and out cast of all the world: as Paul wytnessythe of the
apostles, of the martyrs, confessors, The patiency of ye apostils. 1. Cor. 4.
Expo
and preachers of the word of God, saying, Spectaculum facti sumus mundo, and
angelis and hominibus. Nos stulti propter Christum, infirmi, ignobiles:
esurimus, sitimus, nudi sumus, colaphis cedimur, instabiles sumus, maledicimur
and benedicimus, persecutionem patimur and sustinemus, blasphemamur and
obsecramus, tanque purgamenta huius mundi facti sumus, omnium peripsema usque

Spectaculum, as a spectacle. Spectaculum quid?
A spectacle is a thing that me^ do set up openly in derysyon, to be
wondrede at, to be gased on. So was christ here maad a Spectacle, set in hye
place to be wondered at, as luke rehersyth. Omnis turba qui simul adera^t ad
spectaculu^ istud and uideba^t quae fieba^t, ^
percutientes pectora sua reuerteba^tur. All the people yt were present at this
spectacle, at this passion of xp^e, and saw what was done, they turnyd
backward, knokkynge there breasts, and went there way. This was Christ maad a
mokkynge stoke, and so war his disciples. And therefore they say in letter a
fore recitid, Stulti.
Stulti facti sumus propter Christu^. We be reputed of ye world as fools, for

Facti sumus peripsema. We are had in reputacion of the world Abiectissimi,

worldely myseryes and shames, they pacie^tly suf^rede for christ his sake, for
the love of god, lokynge for that reward that God has ordained for those
that patiently does suffer aduersytye and tribulacio^ for him. Remembringe
that the rewards of our pains patiently suffrede here for God are of such
excellencye, that they passes all our deserts, all our good deeds, and
shall be more then kane be esteemed. Quia non sunt condignae passiones huius
temporis ad futuram gloria^ quae reuelabitur in nobis. Roma. 8. The passions
her can not be cownturwyll with the glory yt is ordeynyd for them.
For if thou dyddest ^ulfyll all the precepts of the old law and of the
new, and suffredeste all kinds of torments:: enprysonement, death on the
gybett, thy flesh to be rent and torn with instruments, torture or fire: ye
if thou shuldyst be crucyfyed, lapidate, fried, broyled or bre^te: All this is
not to be wayde nor pondryd to the glory and reward that thou shalt have in
heaven for hit. Patiently therefore such aduersityes as chauncheth, are to be
suffrede for the love of God, which taught us in his yassion, patiently to
suffer for him, which suffryd so patiently for us.

The third part of this passion, stood In summa corporis poena and
afflictione,.3. The inestimable payns and afflictions that christ suffrid
In so horrible and exceeding pains, which were so manifold and grette,
that all the martyrdomes off martyrs, ca^ not be compared unto them. His body
was so tender, his complexion was so pure, his nature was so clean, his
afflictions were so great and manifold, having no comfort in his pangues,
left even post alone, comforteles, without any consolacion or refrygery,
without any aid or help without any cu^forte or refreshynge, without any
mytigacio^ or releffe, left utterly to his enemies hands to do with him even
is they would: and so they did, aslonge as the soul was in the body. They
scurgyd him bownden to a pylleur, Joan 19.
they crowned him with sharp thorn. Matthew. 17.
They crucified him, they nailed him through hands and feet to the cross.
They extended, haalyd and strayned, his blyssyd body so extremely on the
cross, Psalm. 21.
that his synous and veins crakket: yt thou moughtest have no^bred his bones
and Joints. They gave him aysell and gall to drink whenne he cried Sitio, I
am a thyrste. Joan. 19. The tytil set oon ye cross of Christ Joan. 19.
They set this title upon the cross He braice, Greece, and latin, both in
Hebrewe, Greek and laten Jesus Nazarenus rex iudaeorum, Jesus of Nazarethe,
king of Jews. They lift up this cross on heyghe and rushed it down to
the mortes where itt should stand with such a vyolence, Matthew. 27.
that all his blyssed body was in a new tormente, in a new passion. They
hunge on every side of him a theffe in despyte, and to make the people believe,
that he was warse than they, and that he had deserved to dye.

Ibidem
The people stood gasynge upon him, they derided him, they blasphemed him, they
shoke their hedes on him, And mokkishely some said, he has saved other, now
let him save himselffe. Some said, he made him self the sone of God, let god
now help him if he will. Some said Vah qui destruis templum etc Fie on the
that saydest thou would destroy the temple of God and build itt up a yen in
three days. Some said, Ibidem.
if thou be the sone of god as thou make thy self, Ibidem
loose the naylys and come down from the cross, and we will believe in the.
The rulers of the prystes, the scrybes, and the pharysees did as other did,
deryde and blaspheme him: and so did the two thieves that were crucified with
him. See how the storye of this passion agrethe with the saying of the
prophet many years before written: where he says. Ego sum uermis and non homo,
obprobrium hominum and abiectio plebis. Psalm. 21. How vilie christ was reputyd
Omnes uidentes me deriserunt me, locuti sunt labiis and moueru^t caput. All ye
looked upon me (says christ by his prophyte) derided me waggi^ge their
heddes, mouinge their lyppes, speaking blasphemously, and reputed me as no
man, regardyd me no better then they wuld regard a worm, I was had in ye
obprobrye of all men, and taken as the abiecte of the world. This reproach was
so grette, these pangues were so intense, this pallion was so paynefull: that
the prophet Ieremye seeing it long before in spryte, cried in the person of
Christ, O nos omnes qui transitis per uiam, attendite and uidete si est dolor
sicut dolor meus. Tre^^^
O all ye people of the world that shall happen to come by this way, behold
and see how I am wounded how I am crucified, deryded, disdayned, scorned,
vylypended, and despised: under such a fashyo^, as never was seen. Look ye
dylygently and co^sydre, whedre ever any doloure and passion was or is, like
unto this my dolor and passion.

And after many circumstances, christ spoke diverse words hanginge on the
cross, which showed his horrible pains to increase more and more. For the
narre he drew to his death, the more increased his pangues. And yett in all
his torments, he forgate not to pray for those that did crucifye him, and for
the residue of the unlearned ignorante Jews, which conse^ted to his death
saying, Luce. 2^.
Pater ignosce illis, quia nesciunt quid faciunt. Forgive them fadre, forgive
them: for they woot not what they do. They knew him not, they knew not what
they did, therefore he cherytably prayed for them. He cried also to his father,
aledgyd there ignora^cy for there excuse, heloi heloi lamazabathani? my god, my
god,' why do thou forsaake me? Math. 27.
Shaoynge by these words the grette excessive pain that he was in, being
lest barely without any comfort, without any help or socour: And for
veraye pain cried, Sitio, I am a thyrste: Commendinge also his modre to the
custody of saint John, Joan. 19.
a vyrgine to a virgyne: And did forgive the theffe, Luce. 2^.
promysinge him to be in paradyse with him that self same day: And commended
his own soul to his fadre saying. Ibidem.
In manus tuas domine eo^ mendo spiritum meum. I commend and bequayue my soul
and spyryt in to thy hands fadre. Teaching us by that ensample, to give and
bequayue our souls in to the hands of God, when we shall dye.

And for a fardre knowledge and contemplacion of this glorious passion, Quinque
notan^^. Five thigis did augmentyd the payns of this passion.
ye shall understand that five things there war which specially augme^ted the
pains of his passion, videlicet Locus, te^pus, persona a qua sustinuit,
persona passa, and persona pro qua passus est. The first was Locus. The place
where he suffrede, which was Jerusalem, a regal city, a metropolyke city, a
city of magnifycencye, a famous and a populose city: to which City was the
comen course and haunte of all the world..^. Locus.
In which city whenne he went through bearinge his cross to his passion,
his countenance was so pituouse, he was so weak and feeble, the streets being
full of people, they weep in every corner, to see that dolorouse syghte, to see
that panguyous body. Luce. 2^. Expo. Xp^e exhortid ye, people to weep oon the^
selves and oon their children
To whom Christ said, Nolite flere super me, sed super nos ip sos and super
filios uestros. Weep not for me, but weep for yourselues and for your children,
For your selves and for your children, weep not for me. For I shall rise
shortly a yen and show comfort to the world. Weep upon your selves, weep
upon your wicked lives: for for your wretchedness, you and your city shall
perish, weep therefore upon your selves, and weep upon your children. What war
his children, and whose were these children. Certeynly eueriche of them had
children. The children that christ meant, were there wicked deeds. The children
that ye bring forth, are Opera uestra, your warkes. Weep your wicked warkes,
weep your wicked deeds, weep your sins. Thou haste been a proud vain
gloriouse man, full of pride and arrogancye, full of pomp and vain glory,
full of dysdayne and inobediencie: weep this thy pride, weep thy vain glory,
thy pomp and thy arrogancye. Thou haste committed aduoutrye, fornication,
inceste and other carnal filthy lyuynges: weep and utterly repent the for
thyn abominable aduoutrye, for thy viciouse fornicacio^, for thy foul
incestuouse living, for thy caronouse voluptuouse mysse usinge thy body. Weep
these and all thy other damnable children: sin I mean, which thou haste
noryshyd and brought in to this world. Weep thy disobedience to god, thy
malice and glotonye, thy covetousness and lecherye, thy oaths and periurye, thy
vsurye, symonye and blasphemye: with such other thyn abominable deades. These
are thy children, weep these, lamente thy sin and sorrow, Peter. Mary
Magdalen.
thy wretched lyffe. Peter, thryse forsook his master christ, and wept, and
was forgouen. Mary magdalen, abhomynablye lived after a fleshely manner: and
wept, and was forgeuen. David, David. Latro.
lamented his aduoutrye, his murdre and pride, and was forgeuen. The good
theffe, this day sorowefully repented him of his mysselyuinge, and was
forgeuen. weep thoue with them, and thou shalt have mercy, remyssion and
forgyuenes as they had. Luce. 2^
Flete super nos and super filios uestros. Weep upon your selves and upon your
children. Matthew. 2^.
He was led extra portam, out of the yates, into the place called Golgotha in
the mou^te of caluary, a filthy stenchiouse place, a place where comenly the
offenders of the law were put to execucion, as ye will say here in England,
Tyborn, a rebukefull and a slaunderouse place, mete for homycides, for
murderers and felons. And there were present his kynsfolke and friends, his
moore, his disciples, and acquayntaunces with other: whose presens also did
augment his pains.

The second thing that augmented the pains of this passion, was Tempus,.2.
Tempus.
the time of his passion. For it was done in the grett solemn feast of the
Jews, in the feast of Pashe. At which time for the reverence of their pashe
and of their temple, there resorted thidre out of all ye contreys of Iudee, and
of all other nations a bowght. And they being then present in the city, ra^ne
in multitudes to this spectacle, to this show, to this sight. Before whom
openly christ was hanged up Pro ludibrio, for a mocking stock, and how
they deryded him there hanginge, ye have hard.

The third cause of augmentynge the pains of this passion was persona a
qua..3. Persona a qua.
A qua susti nuit. The person of whom and by whom he suffrede. For itt was
not done by straungior nor by every neighbor, butt bye his nighe
acquaintance, by his nighe friends, by his domesticalls and nyghe neighbors,
by his bredren the Jews, of whom he lynyally descended, and was borne of
their stock, lynyally descendinge from king David. And for this cause Christ
this day cryethe by his prophet, Esa^. ^.
Filij matris meae pug nauerunt contra me, and quos nutriui and exaltaui, ipsi
spreuerunt me. My modres children foght faytis a ye^ste me, and those that I
have nourished, brought up, and have promoted: despysethe me. Psalm. 97.
A yen. Amici mei and proximi mei aduersum me appropinquauerunt and steteru^t,
Et qui iuxta me era^t, de long steterunt and uim faciebant qui querebant any
mam meam. This he spoke, to show cumulum misery sue, to show ye hepis and
abundancy of his misery, to show how ye every way his payns dydd increase,
whenne they that ought to love him, forsook him. For all his disciples fled:
when he was taken: Peter denied him thrys^: the syke forsook their physician,
the seruaundes their lord, the creatures their creator, the sinners their
savior. The gentyles and Jews drew nigh to him, not to comfort him, not to
help him, but to noye him, and wryste him to more and more pain And they that
of congruence ought to have be^ cheffly his friends (as the Jews): most
were a yenste him, and laid vyolente hands upon him, and put him to all this
passion.

The fourth thing yt augmented the pain of his passion, was Persona
passa..4. Persona passa.
The person that suffrede, which was him self, Christ itt was yt suffered,
which was of him self an innocente, pure in heart, chaste in body, clean in
thought word and deed. In cuius ore non erat dolus, Esaie. 5^.
nec peccatum fecit, says Esaias. Never evil word passed his mouth, never
evil thought in his heart, he never committed sin: he itt was that dydd
create heaven, earth, the Sees, and all yt is therein. He it was that holdethe
up ye world with his hand that staythe hit, that gouernethe hit, that mouith
and sterithe hytt this way and that way, up and down, to and froo at his
pleasure, he hytt is that does rule, govern and order, all at his will. He
it was that sees all, yt knows all, the sone of god, veraye god, veraye man,
most of might, highest of power: and omnypotent in all his warkes, he it is
that came in to this world to save all mankind, to redeem man, and so did:
and washed us in his blood. And yett most unnaturally, they did put him to
cruel death. He lamentablye therefore does cry by his prophet Ropule meus
quid feci tibi, Michee. 6.
aut quid molestus fui: responde mihi. O my people, what have I done to the?
have not I done ye good? have not I helped the? have not I been beneficial
unto the? have not I don for the more good then thou canste devise? Quid
debui tibi facere quod no^ feci? Esaie. 5. The reproff of falls chryste^ peopel
Responde mihi. What ought I do for the, that I have not done? Show me oon
Jot. Aut quid molestus fui? have I ever ben molestious or grewus unto ye? have
I ever done any grefe to the? any injury? any hurt or wrong? Responde mihi.
Answer, answer ye or nay, spoke to me. If I have done to the so manyfolde
benefytes, and never did the hurt: why art thou so unkind unto me, as this
cruelly to crucifye me? Responde mihi. Answer me: I brought the out of
Egipte, Exodus 20.
out of thraldom,' out of thyn enemies hands, dry foot throghe the sees.
I destroyed thyn enemies. I fed the in deserte fortye years with manna and
coturnices, Exodus 16.
with all dayntye food, and gave the water out of the hard stone. Ibidem. 17.
I gave the terram fluentem lac and mel, the land of beheste: wherein was
abundancye of all pleasures. Exodus 30.
What ought I to do for the, that I have not done? Responde mihi. Show me.
Hiere. 2.
I planted the my beawtefull vine yard. I chose de to be mine elect children,
mine holy people, people chyeffely and a for all other chosen. I came down
unto the, I was conuersaunte with the, I fed the with my word, I fed the
with meat, I healed thy sick and soore, I gave the blind syghte, the deffe
hearing, ye dome speech, the lepurs cle^nes, ye laame their lymmes, and lyffe
to chose yt were dead. What could I do more butt I dydd hytt for the? And yet
thou unkindly doste arredye a cross for me, and doste crucifye me upon hytt.

O Christen man and woman, thynkeste thou that god will not leye annenste the
at that day his manyfolde bountuouse benefits that he has showed unto the
the? and a yen thyn outragiouse unkindness which thou sheweste unto him?
Christen man, christen man, every oon of you look in your selves, whedre god
has done any thing for you or not? look a yen how unkindly ye have
recompensed him. Consider his goodenes, consydre your wykednes. For he daily
cries out unto you and to us all by his prophet, Popule meus quid feci tibi,
Michee. ^.
aut quid molestus fui, responde mihi. Ye Christen people, what have I don unto
you, that ye should thus vnientylly use your selves toward me? Can ye say
any thing to it? Respo^de, speak, let me here what ye can say hereunto? I
do the daily good, and ye daily doste crucifye me, by this abominable lyuinge,
by thy outeragious pomp and pride, by thy wicked malice and envy, by thy
beestly glotonye and voluptye, by thy fylthy lecherouse and carnal life, by
thy heinous peryurye and blasphemye. O Christen man, Quid feci tibi? What have
I done to thy? what occasyion have I gouen,' why thou shuldeste this entreat
me? thus to crucifye me with thy synnefull living? thus to give me aysell and
gall with thy carnal behavior? thus to lance me to the heart with ye spear
of thy blasphemouse tongue. Thyn abominable lyuinge greues me more then did ye
cross, then did the nails, the^ did the aysell and gall, then did the spear,
then did the crown of thorn and the scurges. Thy sinful lyff greues me more
then did all the torments that were putt unto me. O christen man, Q Quid feci
tibi? Quid male feci? Responde mihi. Show me if thou can, any occasion of
unkindness on my behalf done unto the. And thou with out cause thus cruelly
to entreat me? O unkind christen man, what shalt thou ley for thyn excuse
at ye day of judgment whenne this shall be laid annenste the? whenne thy
judge god shall ley this unto thy chardge. When he shall show the, the crown
of thorn, the scurges, the buffates, the strokes, ye cross the naylys, the
aysell, the gall, the sharp spear, the wounds and all the artilery and arms
of his passion: when he shall ley to thy chardge, that you ware the doer of
hytt, that thou war the cause and occasyon of his passion and death? Then
shall he say unto the, Responde mihi. Sinner, make a^swere hereunto. What
answer will thou then make to thy dradfull Judge god? how will thou excuse
the? Excuse there, will not serve: our wicked warkes will then condemn us:
Qua^do unusquisque recipiet prout gessit in corpore suo, sieve bonum sieve malum.
2. Cor 1.5. After our deades we shall be taken.
Wherein as our deeds the^ be: so shall we receive: good or badde, Joy or
pain, heaven or hell, comfort or dampnacion.

Have therefore compassion on thy lord God, and heir his lamentable
complaynte. Show pytye upon him, putt not this heuye cross to him again to
bear, ease him of his heuye burden, Suffer with Christ, bear this cross with
him. Suffer patiently for his sake such aduersytye as he does send, whedre
itt be syckenes or pouertye, myserye or hungre, thyrste, contumelye or shame:
whedre itt be rebuke of the world, tortures, passions, aduersyties, or other
pains. Suffer, Suffer with him. He was an innocente and deserved it not, thou
art a sinner and doeste deserve itt. He entrede the heuens with pain, and
thynkest thou to come thydre with Joy and worldely pleasure? Hieron*
Nemo potest hic gaudere in mu^do, and regnare cum Christo in caelo says
saint Jerome. No man may have here continual Joy, and Joy in heaven: heaven
here and heaven. Worldely glory, is not the way to heaven. Heaven is not wonnen
with eatinge and dr^nkynge, with dalyinge and playnge, with sportinge and
hoytynge: but with pain and penance, with mysery and pouertye, with
aduersitye and tribulacio^. Non est regnum dei esca and potus, Roma 14.
says the apostle. And a yen. Oportebat Christum pati, and sic intrare in
regnum dei. Marc. 8. Christ sufferi^ge pain, entered ye heuens. Actu. 14.
It was behoueable Christ to suffer, and so by sufferaunce and pains to enter
ye heue^s. Much more we ought to suffer, For christ taught us, that Per
multas tribulationes oportet nos intrare in regnum dei, that we must enter ye
heuens by tribulacion and aduersitye. So christ taught us, that penance is
the veraye redye way to heaven, the way by the which Christ and all his
folowers came thidre: Matthew. 4.
There for he said, Poenitentiam agite: appropinquabit regnu^ dei.' Do ye
penance and that shall bring you to ye kyngedome of God.

.5. Persona pro qua passus est.

Christ techythe us her cheritye.


The fyfte thing that augmentyd the pain of this passion of our savior Ihesu
christ, was Persona pro qua passus est, ye person for whom he suffrede. He
suffrede for us sinners, for us unprofitable wretches, for us unkind people,
for us his enemies, being out of ye favor of God, sta^dinge in state of
da^pnacyon: and yett he suffrede for us. What more love kowde i^ this world be
showed, then a man to dye for his enemies as ye hard before? Here be we
taught love and cherite, here we be taught to open our bowelles of mercy to
our poor neighbors in time of necessity, to suffer pain for their
comfort, to suffer death rather then their souls should peryshe. God gave us
ensample. Christus passus est pro nobis, 1. Petri. 2 Expo.
nobis relinque^s exe^plu^, ut sequamini uestigia eius. christ suffrede for
us, leuynge you ensample, how ye should follow his steps. Passus est, he
suffrede. Passus, he suffered. Why suffered he? he was no malefactor, he was no
sinner, he did no iniurye, he profeted every body. Why did he then suffer?
Passus est pro nobis. He suffered for us, why for us? because we were sinners,
and borne the children of wrath and of damnacion. He suffrede therefore for
us, for our redemption, to redeem us from sin, to deliver us from ye
dewell, to save and bring us into ye favor of God. And for this did he
suffer. Did he suffer for any other thing then this? ye forsothe.
wherefore? Vobis relinque^s exemplu^. To give us ensample. what ensample? Vt
sequa mini uestigia eius. That we may follow his steps, that we may walk
the way he walked, yt we may live the lyffe he lived, as nyghe as the
frayltye of nature will suffer. To suffer whe^ne itt shall fortune aduersitye,
tribulacion, mysfortune, displeasure of the world, pouertye, myserye to
chance: or such other. To suffer for him, for he suffrede for us. He is our
hedde, we be his members. Therefore we ought to conform our selves to our
hedde, christ. And for ye purpose Christ says in the Gospel, Matthew. 16.
Expo.
Qui uult uenire post me, abneget semetipsum, tollat crucem suam, and sequatur
me. He that will come after me, must deny himself. He must take his cross
and follow me. And here ar four things taught. Quatuor notanda Thoue must
forsake thy selffe.


First the veraye follower of God must forsake himself, which is a grette
thing to do. Ye but there is a grette reward follows there of. How shalt
thou forsake thy self? It is impossible to goo from thy self. Who can follow
this council? Yes, god does another commau^de another counsel any thing, but
that that is easy of hytt self to do. Math. 11.
For he says Iugum meu^ suaue est and onus meum leave. My Iooke is pleasau^te
and my burden is light. Iugum dei quid?

What is the Iooke of god Onus dei quid?

What is ye burden of god Luce. 1.


What is this Iooke, and what is this burden? This Iooke is the commandments
of god, which does yooke and couple god to man and man to god. This burden is
penance, which is to some, thought to be veraye heuye and burdenouse, and
yett is ytt veraye light, very easy and ientyll, Hominibus bonae uoluntatis,
to them that are well willing. Itt is no mastrye to forsake thy self, to goo
from thy self, if thou list. Itt is no mastrye to forsake thy froward will,
thyn own appetyte, thy sensual desiours, thy fleshely lusts, ye pleasure of
thy body, ye worldely vanytie if you will thy self, if you will follow Xp^e,
if you will committee thy will to his will: And he yt this does, does forsake
himself. Christ whenne he was in most pangues and pains, whenne he was in
his praye^ in the mount, being in that horrible conflicte between sensualitye
and reason: the tone would oon thing, the other would an other. When christ
cried Transeata me calix iste, Fader put away this chalis of death:
Sensualytie would live, Reason would dye: the body would live, the spyryte
would he should dye: Butt christ gave over his will and the sensual appetyte
of the flesh, and said to his fadre, Pater non sicut ego uolo, Luce. 2^.
sed sicut tu uis, fiat uoluntas tua, Not as I will fadre, butt as thou will:
thy will and pleasure be fulfilled. So thou good christen man, if any such
conflycte be in the, follow not sensualitye: follow reason, pray to god for
help and assistans, repress thy carnal will, coarce thy body, desiour god
for grace, call to him for strength in all te^ptacion, desyour his comfort in
all aduersitye and tribulacion, And say with christ, Pater no^ sicut ego
uolo, sed sicut tu uis, fiat uoluntas tua. Fadre of heaven itt shall not be as
the body would, as the flesh desyrethe: butt as thou will lord, thy will be
ever fulfilled.

Secondarily the veraye follower of God must bear his cross. Whose cross?.^.
penance is ye cross of xp^e which you must bear.
The cross of Christ. What is the cross of Christ? Penance. Thou must do
penance. Thou must punish that body that has offended. Punish thy proud
body with low submission to god and with mekenes. Punyshe thy malice, thy
rankor and hatrede, with love, zeal and charity: thy slouthe and
sluggyshenes, with true labor, toil and good warkes: thy glotonye and
bankettinge, with te^perancye, fasting and prayour: thy couetousenes and
wrong doings, with alms, liberalytye and warkes of pytie, thy lecherye and
voluptuouse lyuinge, with fasting, abstinencye, prayour and good occupacion.
This to labor thy body in such pain, trybulacyon, aduersitye, godly watch,
prayour, study, contemplacion. fasting* abstinencie, paciencie, and
sustaynynge stoutgly such other payns is, ye veraye vearinge of the cross of
Christ.

But thou must veare thyn own cross, Cruce^' suam says christ,.5. Thoue
must veaer thyn own cross.
non alienam: thyn own cross not an other man for the. Do thyn own penance,
let not an other man do penance for the. What shall this man's humblenes
proufett thy pride? What shall his pytie proufett thy cruelnes? his fasting
thy glotonye? his labor thy slouthe? his chastytie thy lecherye? his faith
thyn infydelitye? what dydd the humblenes of ye publicane prouffett the proud
pharisey? what did the abstinencye of poor Lazare, help ye rich gloton? What
did the penance and passion of christ prouffett the impenitencie and
disperacion of Judas? The publicane his mekenes, did condemn the proud
pharisei. The miserye of Lazar, dydd confound the rich dyues. The penance of
Christ, shall condemn the obstinate sinners of ye world. For christ bare
his own cross: Lazar, his own cross: the publicane, his own cross: And yett
we dysdayne to bear our own crosses. We are ashamed to humble our selves to
God, to our superiors, to ye laws of christ his church, to the
aduertisemente of the word of God, to the counsel of our goostely fadres. We are ashamed to do penance, ashamed to take pain, ashamed to punyshe ye body
with fasting, prayour, or otherwise. We are ashamed to ask forgiveness of those
that we have offended, or to forgive the offender, or to do any point of
penance. O sinner, whereof comes this but of obstinacye? of disdain? of
pride of heart? of lack of grace? O Sinner, Sinner: bear thyn own cross, do
thyn own penance, punish thyn own body. For christ says in Mathewe, Qui
no^ baiulat cruce^ suam, no^ est me dignus. ^
He that bearithe not his own cross, he that does not penance in his own
person, he is not worthy for me. Tollat crucem suam. Let every man therefore
bear his own cross, and do his own penance, if he look to have remyssion of
his sins. And saint John says. 1. Joan ^. Expo. How the xp^en man owght to
walk
Qui dicit se in Christo manner debet sicut ille ambulauit, and ipse ambulare.
He that says that he that does dwell in Christ, he ought to walk as
Christ did walk. Christ walked in humilitye, christ walked in obedience, in
chastytie, in prayour, in fasting, temperancye, love, charity, penance, and
in such other virtuous. Do thou so thou christen man.

Fourthely, therefore he says in ye former letter of Matthew a for rehearsed,.4.
How you owghtest to foloo Christ
Sequatur me. He must follow me says Christ, Follow thou thy mastre christ
in these and in all such other like virtues. For the former letter of Peter
says, Vt sequamini uestigia eius. And in the the other lettre Et sequatur me.
Here is the veraye form and rule of a christen man and woman, to follow the
steps of Christ, to follow the lyff of Christ, to follow the ensample that
Christ gave us. He says, Joan. 13.
Exemplum dedi nobis ut quemadmodum ego feci, ita and nos faciatis. I gave you
ensample how to live, how to do: yt ye should walk as I walkede, live as I
lyuid, do as I did. Why, how walked christ? how lyuyd he? how dydd he? Omnia
been fecit, Marc. 7. ^. Petr. 2.
and again? Peccatum non fecit, nec est inue^tus dolus in ore eius. He did all
things well, he did no sin, there was no gyyl in him, no dole, no frawd nor
suttyltye, no dobulnes, but truth. He was an innoce^te, he deserved not to
dye, not to be punished, and yet he would suffer, yett he wuld suffer pain,
suffer passion and death. He wuld give his soul and liffe for his people: to
instruct us sinners what we should do, in seeing this innocente so
voluntarily and with out cause to suffer: so to instruct us voluntary lie to
sustain pain for our sins, to instruct us that the veraye true and suere
way to heaven, is by pain, by pain and sufferynge, as a for is rehersyd.
Marc. 8. Expo.
Oportebat Christum pati and sic intrare in regnum coeloru^, in gloriam suam.
It was behoueable Christ for to suffer, and so to enter the heuens. This
word, Sic, is added, Actu. 14. Presu^pcion of synes.
to show the veraye manner and form, to show the veraye strayt rule and high
way to the sinner, how to attchyue and purchays the glory of God. And a yen
for our part says, Per multas tribulationes oportet intrare in regnum dei.
The veraye way to heaven, is to live in much trouble and aduersitye, to suffer
much pain and mysery.

Let no man therefore, be so suere of him self to say. Christ has
suffrede for me. Christ has shed his blood and washed me. Christ has
paid my rawnsome, he will not loose this grette price: how ever I live, he
has redeemed me: how ever I live, I shall be sauede, I need not to do any
penance for my sin, for Christ has satisfied for me. My syne is washed
away, Itt is consumed and sowped up by virtue of this blood. And such
other presu^ptuous words they have to mayntayn there fleshely and carnal
lybertye, to there own confusion and dampnacion. O meruelouse God what a
presumpcion is this emonges us Christen people? what a blyndenes reigns
emonges us: yt have receued the light of grace and knowledge of the laws of
God? Thoue christen man and woman I tell ye, that God is full of mercy, ye god
is as full of mercy as we have spoken of, and I assure the again, he is even as
just oon ye the other side. God that here will remytte the sin of ye penytente,
there will condemn to death ye presumptuouse sinner, the unpenitent person,
the wretchid liver. This just judge god does require of the besides the price
of his blood, penance: mercy toward thy neighbor, fear and dred of god,
he requirethe of the a sinner repentans, soroo, contricion, confession, he
requyrethe of the a true faith, a constante hoope, a ferue^te charithe, and
faithefull charitable warkes. He requyrithe of the, the obseruacion of his
laws, and to be a true feloer of him. He requyrethe of the, to live in his
obediency, in humilitye, in simplicite of heart, in cle^nesse of that kind of
chastity that thou art called unto, he requyrythe of the to be constante in
him, to flee syne, to resyste temptacion, to love virtue, and to walk in that
calling that thou art callid unto, to live cristianly. Scripture plainly
does show all this and much more yt is requyrid to a christen man to do,
The places where, are manyfeste.

He gave us an other ensample. For itt follows in the former lettre Qui cum
malediceretur, 1. Petri. 2.
non maledicebat: cum pateretur, non comminabatur. Christ gave her an ensample
of charity.
Whenne the Jews said evil by him, in blasphemynge him, rebukynge him
saying, Reus est mortis, Crucifigatur, Vah qui destruis templum, desce^de de
cruce and credemus tibi, Salua te ipsu^ si potes, dae moniu^ habes: And such
other scornful, rebukefull and blasphemouse words: Yet No^ maledicebat, he
gave noon evil answer, but prayde for the^, and keep him in a muette, in a
charitable silence: And all was to give ye and me knowledge, how to follow him
in his steps, in his living, in his ensample, Vt sequamini uestigia eius. To
have you follow his steps, and to tell you of all his steps, of all his
ensampulis, time will not suffer. The some of the hooll tale is, that he
showed and proved him self in all his doings to be veraye god. And yett was
he deus absconditus, A hid god to the world, the world knew him not.
(...) Christ dyinge cryid. Caelum. Angeli. Sol. Luna. Stellae. Velum. Terra.

Therefore to give them more experience of his godhedde, he would dye, Et cum
clamore ualido expirauit. With an horrible houge cry, he gave up his soul,
he yielded up his spyryte, he departed the world. At which howdge voice,
all ye creatures of the world were astoned and moved. The heue^s tremulde. The
angels wept. The son, ye moan, the sterres, lost their light. The veil
in ye temple rent in two pieces. The earth through the world quauyd. The
stone braste in so^dre. Sepulcra. Mortul. Centurio. Matthew. 27.
The graves opened. The dead bodies rose and appeared to diverse in ye City.
Centurio and those yt were with him, seeing this grette terrible tokens, cried,
Vere filius dei erat iste'. Undoubted this was the sone of God. This was the
veraye sone of god. Marc. 15.
Other cried. Hic homo iustus erat. This was a just man, this was an
innocente, alas, what have we done. They were dysmayde, they were abashed, they
wyste not what would come of itt, they feared vengeance and the grett stroke
of god, they tremuld in their hearts, they hylde down their heddes as men
dismayde, they cried inwardely, alas what have we done. They knocked their
breasts, they returned with heuye hearts to their houses, Luce. 23.
Percutie^ tes pectora sua reuertebantur. And were in such horrible drade and
fear, that in ye world they wiste not what to do: but syghed and sobbed,
wept and lamented, and went their way. Lokynge for some grette stroke and
punisheme^t to fall upon them, for this grette abominable dead they had don.
This our savior Christ, did for his people dye: Et ipse redemit Israel ex
omnibus iniquitatibus eius. This he has redeemed Israel his people from all
there iniquities. Litera* Expo.
Which people? The Israelites, the gentyls: ye all the world. From which
iniquities? From this and that? ye from this and from that, and from all.
From all iniquytyes. From iniquity original and actual: actual venial,
and actual mortal.

The prophet many years before this redemption was wrought, being in assurans
of hytt veraly to come, spoke these words in the future tens, in the time to
come, saying Redimet Israel, he shall redeem Israel. But now we may say '
Redemit Israel, in the time that is paste, he has redeemed Israel from all
his iniquyties and sin. And how, ye have hard: by this his dear dolorouse
death and passion.

And whenne he was dead, Joan. 19. Joseph.
Venit Joseph ab arimathia and petijt corpus Jesus a Pylato etc. Joseph of
Arymathy, of that city, came boldly unto Pylate, and asked licens to take
down the body from of the cross and to burye itt, And had leave so to
do. Nicodemus.
And with him came Nichodemus an other secrette disciple of Christ, both
just and good men. And in mean time whiles they were asking this lyce^s,
came certain soldiers of the Jews, deputed to keep this body that itt
should not be taken away: and braake the sha^kebones of their legs that
were crucified with Christ. And whenne they came to Jesus and saw him dead,
they braake not his legs: butt a soldier with a spear, opened his said,
and lau^ced him to the heart. And streyghte forth gowshed out blood and
water, Exiuit sa^guis and aqua.
blud in our redemption, water in our purificacio^: blud in remission, water in
mundifyinge and washinge: blud in price, wator in baptysme, bludd and wator
rane out of his heart and syyd. Then Joseph with Nycodemus took down this
most preciouse body, and reverently laid itt in a fine sindone, in a fine
fair lynyn clothe: as ye wuld say, Syndon. Myrre. Aloes.
clothe of rayns, clothe of the fyneste soorte. And they sprynkelede the body
plentifully with myrre and aloes, allmooste to the mou^tenance of a.C. pounds.
And wrapped this body in ye clean fine Syndon and clothe honorably, Syndon
Nouu^ sepulchru^.
and putt him into a new sepulcre, wherein never body was buried before. A
strange sepulcre, not his own, and laid a howdge stone upon ye mouth of the
sepulcre, Lapis.
where he lay dead.xl. hours: which was three days inclusiue. Oon part of
the frydaye, the saterdaye hoolle, and part of the sunday. And thus was he
buried with honor, and reuerens, kept with angels, with their diligent
obsequye and service, with grett reverence and custodye. Angeli. How they took
Xp^e from the cross and buryd him.


O thou christen man, learn how to burye thy lord and God. First take him
reverently down from ye cross. But how shalt thou take him from the
cross? Suerly by having in thy devout and pituouse remembrance, his death.
To remember particulerly, every part of his passion, his mawndye which he
made to his disciples, the washing of their feet, ye panguyouse prayer he
made in the mount. To remember his betrayinge, how he was taken, how bette
and bobbed, how he was brought tofore diverse judges, how falsely he was
accused. To remember how he was scourged and beaten, crowned with thorn:
blyndfelded, deryded, bobbed and bette, condemned to death: and how he baare
his cross to the place, where he dydd suffer. To Remember the naylinge, the
crucifyinge, the derydynge, the blasphemye, the scorns and mockes, which the
Jews dydd unto him. To Remember the mercy he showed whe^ne he prayed for his
tormentours, the aysell and gall he tasted, the lamentable complaynte he made
to his fadre of the excessive pains he had as a man left alone without all
comfort. To Remember how tenderly he had his modre in remembrance in that
deathely pangues whe^ne he deputid her in to ye custody of his disciple John
to remember a yen how he thirsted, how he forgave ye theffe and promised him
paradise. How he commended his soul in to his fadres hands, how he showed
that he had fulfilled all things that was written of him by the prophets. To
Remember how that at his cry whenne the soul departed, all the creatures in
heaven, earth and hell, was astoned and moved to pity and to compassion: and
in their manner, lamented and wept his death. This ought thou euerry day
to remember. For this is the spyrituall taking down of Christ from the
cross. To have his passion and every particular and singular part of the same
in thy continual remembrance.

How you shall lay christ in his wyndynge sheett.
Then lay him in a clean fine Syndon, in a clean wyndinge shete. That is,
to see thy conscience to be pure and clean. Clean without weme of sin.
Clean, that nothing therein remain, whereby God moughte be offended, yt there
be in the another delight unto sin nor consent, nor act, nor custom, nor
bloot, nor spote, nor smake, nor taste: let no color nor defense of sin be
within the, despair nor presumpcion: but a hool faythefull true trust and
affiaunce in the high mercy of God.

How you shalt dress the body of christ with myrre and aloes. Myrre. Iudit 10.
Fear of God, Eccle. ^3.
Then sprynkle and cast upon him plentyfully, both myrre and aloes. Myrre is
bittur, and is a dryer and a consumer of humores and a preserver from
corrupcio^. Vnxit me mirrho optimo,' He anointed me with most preciouse
myrre. And signifies Timorem domini, ye fear and dread of God, which dries
up the humor of sin,' which defends man from thacte of iniquytye and
preserves him in grace and in favor of God. Timenti deum non occurrent mala,
sed in tentatione deus illum conseruabit, and liberabit a malis No evil nor
hurt, no dangiour of sin shall chance to him that fears god: but God
shall preserve him in time of temptacio^, and will deliver him from all evil.
And a yen. Timor domini expellit peccatum, and qui sine timore est, Ibidem. 1.
no^ poterit iustificari. The fear and dradde of God does expel sin. And
he that is without fear of God, ca^ not be justified. Have thoue therefore the
fear and dread of God.

Then take aloes, which is also bittur of it self: but it is pleasant in
savor, Aloes.
pleasant in smelle. And likewise purges humores and conserueth the body
from putrefaction: and sygnifyeth veraye contricion, which though itt be of
it self bittur and displeasaunte, yett itt does merueloussely purge and
cleanse man from the humor of sin, and conserueth him graciously in the
favor of God, and preserves him from all inconveniences of the soul. Date
uinum his qui amaro sunt animo, faith scripture. Pra^er ^^ Vinum. Expo.
Give the^ wine that are this sorowefull in their hearts for their sins.
Comfort them that are inwardely aggreuyd with themselves and repentaunte for
there sins. Date uinum his, give them wine. what is this wine, but a
spiritual inward comfort? And so does god inwardely comfort ye veraye true
contryte penitent person. He is not alive that can tell nor declare, the
special inward comfort, the secrette Joy and gladenes, that the true
penitent has by twen god and him. For though he weep openly, though he
mourn and lamente outwardely: noon can tell but only god and the party, what
inward conforthe the weeping penitent has. Videmus cruces ^orum, sed non
unctiones says sint Barnard. We see there crosses, we see there soroo and
lamentinge, we see there fasting, abstinency, wache, study, contemplacion and
prayour. We see the pacie^cy in pouertye, we see ye mysery and pain they do
suffer for god: But we see not the vertuousnes of the holy gooste, we see not
the conforte, ye Joy they have in god inwardly, we see not that heavenly
visions, that swett dremes, nor that angelyke cumforte they have. This ought
y^ to wrappe and ley up this blyssed body of christ and God.

Sepultura How thoue shaltt lay criste in the sepulture. Lapisquid significat.
Consta^tia Perseuera^tia.
Then put this body in to the sepulture, this sepulture is thy soul, thoue
puttyste him in to the sepulture, whenne thou doeste receive him, burye him in
this sepulture of thy soul, keep him there, let him rest within the, lay a
stone upon this sepulcre. This stone is constantia, perseuerantia, the virtue
that is called co^stancye, perseueraunce, to be constaunte and permanente in
that godly penitent lyffe that thou haste now taken upon the, and to continue
in virtue. For thapostle co^fortinge good people to continue in virtue, says,
Fratres stabiles estote and immobiles, habundantes in omni opere domini semper,
scientes quod labor uester non est maius in dn^o. 1. Cor. 15.
Bredren in Christ, be you always growinge and increasynge plentyfully in
every good warke of God. Waver not, let not every wind nor every light word
call you from your virtuous conversation that ye have taken on you. For itt
is not he that begins in virtue, but he that perseuereth and continues,
that shall be crowned. Esto fidelis usque ad mortem, Apoc. ^*
and dabo tibi corona^ uitae says god. Be thoue a faithefull servant and
continue in virtue unto thy death, and then I will give the ye crown and
reward of glory. And the euangeliste Mathewe wytnessythe the same saying, Qui
perseuerauerit usque in finem, Matthew. ^^
hic saluus erit. He that does persevere and continue in virtue to his lives
end, he shall be sauyd. Many there be that begins well, but few does
continue. Judas began well, but endyd naught. Paul begane nawght, but endyd
well. Itt is not the begynner, but the continuer in virtue yt shall be rewarded
and saved. Lap^^.
This stone sygnifyethe also Firmu^ propositum non relabendi: A stedefaste
purpose no more to fall, but constantly to stand and continue in thy godly
purposse, in thy godly lyffe of penance.

This with honor Christ was buried, and rested in his sepulture three days
exclusive, ^
and was obsequyously and reuerentely kept with angels. And this he showed
him self to ye world, as well by his lyffe time as by his death, that he was
veraye God. And yet he was to the world, ' deus absconditus, a hydd god, ^
and not known to ye world. For as Mathewe shewethe after he was buried, ye
pryncis of the prystes and the pharyseis came to pylate sainge, Sir, we
remember we ell that this deceiuer of the people said whe^ne he was a live,
that he would arise after the third day from death to lyffe. Command ye
therefore that his sepulcre be kept and watched till the third day be paste,
lest peradventure his disciples will come and stele him away, and tell the
people that he is risen from death to lyffe. And then shall the opynion of
the people be warse then ever itt was before. Pylate said, ye know right
well how to keep him, ye have kepers enoughe, Christ desce^dyd to ye helles
and was ^her whilis ye body lay in the sepulture, and what his desce^cio^
thither did profet us? Joan. 12. Expo.
do as ye list in that. They went their way, and set kepers abowte the
sepulcre to watch the same. And sealed the grette stone that was laid on the
mouth of ye said sepulcre, that no man should open the same but it should be
known and punished.

These three days whiles this body lay dead in the sepulcre, the soul of
Christ Joined to his godhede, descended to the helles, not as oon yt was
gyltye, not as oon worthy to go thedre, not as oon there to be enprysoned: butt
as a victor, as a noble captain, as a conqueror which tryumphed and had
victoryously overcome his enemies, and conquered all under his hand. For he
said long before this. Si exaltatus fuero a terra, omnia traham ad me. If I be
exalted and lift up from the earth, I will draw all unto me. And mente,
that whenne he was lift up upon the crose, that then he would draw all his
people unto him, and cause all the people the^ to know him, and so did.
Did not he draw unto him, by a marvelous admyracio^ of his death, passion,
and asce^cion, the heaven? the angels? when they said, Quis estiste qui uenit
de Edo^ tinctis uestibus de Bosra? Who is this that cu^mithe from Edom and
Jerusalem so victoriously in blody apparel? dydd not he draw unto him by
admyracion of this passion the sone? the moon? the sterres? the veil? the
graves? the dead bodies? ye stones? the earth? did not he draw unto him the
hearts of Centurio and of those that were with him cryinge, Vere hic filius dei
erat? dydd not he draw unto him the hearts of those that went away from
the cross lamentinge and weeping? And now he descended in to ye helles to
pull unto him ye resydue, the captives that were there? He drew unto him all
that were his electes in hell, whom the dewell tirannously did possess. He
drew unto him all, Omnia (inquit) ad me traha^. I will draw all unto me, of
every kind of people some, of every nation some: of every degree, of every
state, of every sex. He left noon behind him that was his by faith and good
living.

He had promised a fore by his prophet, utterly to spoil hell and to sleye
death: Osee. 13. Expo.
saying, Ero mors tua o mors, ero morsus tuus inferne. O thou death, I shall be
thy death, and thoue hell, I will byyte the. Christ was ye death of death,
christ slew and overcame death: Christ bytte ye hell whenne he took all
with him that was his: and left those behind that appertayned not unto him.
We see that, that a man killethe, he destroyethe itt utterly, so that itt
shall have no more being, and that, that a man bytethe, he takes part away
and part he leauethe. Therefore forasmoche as Christ did utterly slaye
death in his electes, he was mors mortis, death to death. And for yt he took
part owte of hell, and part left there: he did not utterly slay or kill
hell, but dydd byte itt: he took away part and left part: he took away the
good and left the badde, he took away the electes and left the da^nates.

Then and there at the coming of our lord Jesus Christ to hell, The
exclamacion and murmur of ye d^uels in the cumminge of Christ to ^ell.
the boltes losed, the locks and yates opened, he bound ye prince of
darkness, he troublede the legions of dewelles, he losed ye just people, he
delivered the captives, he putt them to liberty, he gave light to those that
were in darkness. He showed him selffe there gloriouse to his electes, terrible
to the tartaria^s, to the dewelles and to the dampened sort. Which said
within them selves, what dradfull and horrible lyght^ is this that is come here
in to this our darkness? who is this that so tryumphuously does invade us? he
is an Inuador and not a suter, he comethe to take away and not to tarry, he
comethe as a conqueror and not as a prisoner, he comethe as a judge and not
as oon yt should be judged, he comethe to deliver and not to bring prisoners.
If he were gyltye, he would not be so bold, nor come so tryu^phusly as he do
the. And if he be god, what does he here in hell, and wherefore comethe he? If
he be man, why presumethe he so boldly? If he be man, why comethe he so
strongely? If he be God, what does his body in the sepulcre? If he be man,
how is ytt that he does loose these our prisoners? We know well that he was
betrayede, we know well that he was taken, bounden, illuded, deryded, mocked,
scourged, bobbed, beete, crucified, and dyed: And yett here he lyuethe, here he
shewethe his high power. For never man came hydre before now, that did put
us in this fear and subjection. Never man before him, took away our power. For
ye which they made an owte cry anenste their prince Sathanas, saying, what
haste thou don? Is not this he in whose death thou most reioycyddyste? Is
not this he in whose cross and death y^ thoughtyste to have subdued all the
world? And loo, he breaks all thy prysones, he lettythe to lybertye all thy
captyues, he loose the all thy prisoners, he turnethe their sorrow into Joy,
their darkness into light, their bands into lybertye, their pains into
pleasure. O sathane what haste thou don? that treasure that thou brough test
in by the tree in paradyse, thou losyste by ye tree of the cross. Our comfort
is gone, our Joy is turned into sorrow. For whe^ne thou dyddeste cause this
christ to be hanged on ye cross, thou dyddeste loose thy possessions her in
hell.

And after all these complayntes of ye dewelles, streyghte and out of hand,
all the holy fadres there, dydd welcome Christ their lord god, who^ they so
long had looked for, in whom was their trust and expectacion, their hope and
Joy, their lyffe and comfort. For he was their lyffe, their solace, their
consolacion and Joy. In this his cominge, our ba^des brake, our darkness
fled, our death dyed, our pain surceased, our lyffe is restored.

Resurrectio Christi.

The effect of ye resurrection of Christ.


This pray in hell under this manner taken, the soul of christ returned unto ye
dead body, unto the body that lay dedd in the sepulture: ye body reuyued, he
raised him self to lyffe by his own godly power, and rysse out of the
sepulcre a live. He appeared unto Mary magdalen, and called here by her name,
Maria. He appeared unto diverse of his disciples many times, and many ways, to
approve his resurrection and to putt itt out of doubt, he appeared unto the^
all to gether and showed the wounds of his hands and of his side. And to putt
away all suspicion, he badde saint Thomas putt his fyngers into his wounds,
and his hand into his side. He eat and drank with them, and many ways prouid
that he was verily ryssen. Thus his death was our lyffe, his buryall, was our
quyetnes after our death till the body shall rise a yen. His descencyo^ into
hell, delivered us from thens. His gloriouse resurreccion, shall reyse us
from death to ye lyffe. His ascencion shall be the cause of our ascencion into
the heuens.

And of what effect his death was, the apostle she with where he says

reconciliati sumus deo per mortem filij eius. We are iustyfyed in the blood
of christ. And where we were his enemies, we are reconcyled to god and
brought in to his favor by the death of his sone. So that his blood and
death was our iustificacion, our redemption, our remyssion, our
sanctificacion, our lyffe and salvation.

that shall arrayse all that shall be then dead, and call to gether all the
hool world, is called tuba, a tru^pe. In this tru^pe of god, in this voice of
tharchaungell, Christ shall descend from heaven, christ shall manifestly and
openly come to judge ye world. In which resurreccion, all thaduersaryes of
God, the Jews, the paganes, the false Chryste^ people, shall be condemned: and
the veraye true Christen man and woman, shall receive there reward and glory,
of whom itt is written. Beati qui habe^t partem in resurrectione mortuoru^.

Blessed be those that has their part in the resurreccion of just people
that are dead. Uppo^ this gloriouse resurrection of Christ, all the some of

tyranny of the devil: by this resurreccion, we be delyuerede from eternal
death: by this, we shall rise to ye everlasting lyffe: by this, we shall
enter into the enheritau^ce of God, into ye everlasting glory, and reign in
ye everlasting felicitye.

glad your minds, he shall be your inward coforter, your inward solace. He
shall pull and rauishe your minds into God, he shall make you despise this
world, he shall fyxe and anchore your minds and love in me. He shall purge
and cleanse your souls, he shall fill you full of grace, and shall make you ye
^eraye temples and vessels of god. Loo, loo. Here may ye see the grette
prouffett of the passion of Christ, of his buryall, of his descencio^ into
hell, of his resurreccion, and of his ascension into ye heuens. Thus our most
blyssed savior Jesus Christ showed and proved himself every ways both in
his nativity, in his lyffe, in his death, in his passion, in his burial, in
his descencion unto hell, in his resurreccion, in his asce^cion, and in
sendinge the holy gooste in to his church for our co^fortes, to be veraye god.

Let us therefore Christen people for whom Christ has thus shed his
blood, give thanks for his passion, let us joy in his resurrection, let us
laud him for his ascencio^, for all ye hoole catholic church thrughoute the
world does rejoice therein: besechinge him that did this much for us, that
he will of his merciful godenes bring and make us tascend in to this his
glory. Let us Christen people rejoice ye cryite was borne, to teach us, that
he died, to heal us. For his cross was death to him, and to us lyffe. His
nativity was joy to all the world. His lyffe and doctrine was to us light
and comfort: his passion and death was to us lyffe and solace: his
resurreccion was to us joy and glory. Ad (...)*
For after he was dead and went to the helles, he reuerted again to the world
and tryumphed. For he appeared to saint Thomas and said, putt thy fingre in to
the wounds of my side, touch my wounds, see how that out of them ran
blood. Look thomas upon ye price of ye world, look upon ye signs of the
nails, for in those wou^des shalt you find remeadye and health for all ye
sores of thy soul.

And to you ye Jews, scrybes, and pharysees: behold you this sepulcre, Ad
Iudaeos and pharisaeos.
and recognice your sacrilege committed annenste your lord God, behold you
the grette cross, behold you ye roughe nails, behold the sharp spear.
Behold the soore greuoouse woundyd body, which ye prykled, which ye
scourged, which ye wounded and enuiously entreated. Behold you ye sepulcre in
which he was buried. It is void, the body is risen and ascended to the
fadre, to your confusion and dampnacion. For Christ reseruethe fixuras
clauoru^, the marks and scarres of the nails and wou^des, to show unto you
at that great day, your facrilegiouse tyra^nye which ye have done unto ye
body, yt ye may there see your deades, that ye may there see your myscheuouse
acts, your abominable doings, to your own confusion, shame, and dampnacion.
O pharyses, scrybes, and Jews: consydre your malice: consydre your malignitye
committed annenste your maker christ. Revoke your malice, putt away your
enuiouse hearts, do ye penance, weep and wayle your sins, cry to this
crucyfied christ that he may remytte and forgive you your offenses.

And you chryste^ people, come ye nere, Joy ye and comfort your selves in this
christ and god, in this savior of the world. Study you to live in him, to
live in a sobrenes, in a clennes and chastitye, to live chrystianely, godly and
virtuously.

Christen man thou haste hard now, how many ways criste has opened and
showed him self to the world, and proved him self veraye god. And namely in
his passion and death, in his desce^cion to hell, in his resurreccion: and
principally whenne he ascended unto the heuens bodily, and there sytteth in
dextera patris on the right hand of the fadre.

which gave them veraye knowledge of christ to be god. They went then
straight forth abroode and preached christ, and taught him to the world. At
whose words the people came in, they ran to penance, they took baptysme,
they began to smake of god, they lamented their sins, they cried for
mercy, they began a Chrystian lyff. And to declare Christ abroad to all the
world, the disciples divided the^ selves into sundry parts and countries:
Petrus. Paulus. Mattheus. Thomas. Bartholomaeus. Andreas. Johannes. Iacobi.
Peter into Jerusalem, Antioche, and Rome. Paul into Rome, Damask, Atheyns,
Galathy, Corynthy, Sythia and Tracy. Mathewe into Ethyope, Thomas into India
Inde. Bartholomewe into the other India. Andrewe into Achaia and Jerusalem,
John into Asia. Both the James, in terra^ Jude into the land of Jude. And the
residue of the^ after there lymytacion and lotte: some into oon country, and
some into an other: so to edyfye christ his faith, so to buyld his church,
so to show god to the world. And annon Christ grew in knowledge to the
world, annon the people began to know him: to smake and savor of him: butt
not in all parts. For after that Paul was converted and went abroad
preachinge christ, Act. 17.
he came into the cite of Athenes. And as his custom was, ever whenne he came
into a City or town, he would first vysyte the temple or church, and so
dydd there, and walked about their temple, and behylde the manner of their
sacrifyce and culture of their gods: where he saw many ymagies and aulters.
And upon every altar was a title set up to show in whose honor itt was
dedicated. Some altar was dedicate as appeared by the scripture to the gods
of Asia, some to the goddis of Europe, some of Aphryca. Some to Iouis, some to
Mercury, to ye Son, to Mars, to the Moon, and to such other. And over oon
altar was written for the title to whom that aultre was dedicate, these words*
Ignoto deo. This altar is consecrate in ye honor of the unknown god, Ignoto
deo.
Ignoto deo, to ye unknown god. And Paul seeing this, cried to the people, O
uiri Athenie^ses, per omnia uideo nos superstitiosos. O you people of Athaynes,
Act. 17.
I see you almost in all things concerning your rytes and customs in your
temple, to be superstitiouse. I se your aultres dedicate, some to oon god, some
to an other. Unto those that are no gods but creatures, symulacres and dead
things. And oon of your aulters is made and sanctified Ignoto deo, to an
unknown god. Quem ergo ignorantes colitis, Ibidem.
hunc ego annuncio nobis. I am no p^acher nor teacher of new goddis. I do not
faint any new gods, but I do show you the old god, the god of Gods, the
God everlasting, the god that is without beginning, and shall be with out
ending, the only god of heaven and earth, which ye yett know not, and yet
ye worshipe him in your temple at oon of your aulters: where is written Ignoto
deo, Dedicat to an unknown god. Et quem ignorantes colitis, hu^c ego annuntio
nobis. I preach this god unto you that ye do worshipe and know not. Ye
worshipe a god at this altar, and know not whom ye worshype, nor what God,
I preach him unto you. This is he that mad heaven and earth and all that is
therein. This is the lord of all. Of him all things has their beynges. This
is he yt maade the first man of nawght, and of that oon man, all man kind.
This is he that took ye same nature oon him, so to be known to the world. And
that is itt that the philosopher says, and rehersid by the appostul, Ipsius
enim and genus sumus. A^atus poeta. (...)
He took our nature and became man. In ipso viuimus, mouemur and sumus. In him
and by him we live and have our being, our mouynge, our lyff, and all that we
have. This is he yt ye have putto death and passion, This is he yt suffrede
for you, yt dyyd oon the cross. Christ is now declared unto all ye worlld.
He is the price of the world, he has washed you in his blood. He was the
sacryfyce for ye hool world, he made thattonme^te between god and man. He is
the mediator that procurethe remyssion of sin. And he shall come a yen and
judge ye world. Hunc ego annu^tio nobis. This god I show and preche unto you
and to all ye world. This is he that was unknown, that now is known to all
ye world to be God. And though the Jews and pagans, though the Sarysons,
infydelles, and Turks, will not yett know him, worshype him, now take him
for their god: at the day of judgment whenne he shall come again, then
shall they see him, the^ shall they feale him and know him. The^ shall they
know ye high might and power of this lord and god. Then shall they know yt he
is veraye god. The^ shall he show hi^ sylf to ye world as he is, Esaia. 3.
Apoc. 1. Christ shall come in a majesty.
god and man. Ecce ueniet cu^ nubibus and uidebit eu^ oi^s oculus and qui cum
pupugerunt. Et plangent se super eum omnes tribus terre, etiam Amen. He shall
come in ye clouds and (as Mathewe does say) he shall come in a grette
majesty, and every eye, every person, ye all man kind shall then see him,
ye and they that has pryked and provoked him to wrath and to displeasur and
they that has crucified and wou^dyd him. All shall see and know him then.

Then shall see him in a majesty all the unfaithful nations and false
Chryste^ people. Then shall see him in a majesty the Jews and ministres of
Pylate, whom they did deryde, scorn, prycke and crucifye. They shall then
see him to their greatte discomfyte, shame, and reproach: to their grette
sorrow, heaviness, fear, and confusion. ' Et plangent se super eu^ omnes tribus
terrae. Then shall be ye grett weeping.
All the trybs and nations of ye world shall then weep the^ selves upon him.
Also say, Though in this world be meruelouse wepi^ges, heuines, and sorrows,
for such myseryes as here ar: yett in comparyson of ye wepinge that shall be at
that day: all these wepinges, sorrows and lamentinges, ar but tryfles,
fantasies, and shadows.

There shall weep the infydeles that would not believe in Christ, ye dydd putt
Christ to death. Infidel^
There shall weep the gentyls that worshyped false ydols and committed
ydolatrye, Gent^l^ Falsi chri^stiani*
There shall weep the false Christen man that has broken his faith and
promise made to god in his baptysme: he shall weep the abbreache of the
faith, yt he has broken. He shall weep the grace that he has lost, ye
good deeds that he has omytted, the sin that he has committed, the heaven
and Joy that he has lost, the hell and pain yt he shall have. There shall
they weep this passion of Christ whose merits they have lost. There shall
weep the cruel Jews, Iudaei. Jews.
which wuld not believe in Christ, but cruelly crucified him to the death.
Tunc aspicient ad eu^ que^ confixerunt and plangent cum planctu quasi
unigen^tum, and dolebunt super cum ut doleri solet in mor^e primogeniti. In die
illa erit planctus magnus. Then shall they see and behold him that they did
crucify and faste^ to ye cross, and shall weep and sorrow him, as men ar
wont to weep ye death of their child whe^ne they have but oon. In that day
there shall be much wepinge, much sorrow and wonderful heaviness: syghinge,
sobbing, and extreme lame^tacions.

Weep therefore thoue Christen man whiles thou lyueste, weep thy sin, sorrow
thy missededs, lamente thy wretched lyffe. Call to thy merciful lord god,
yondre he is, in yondre sepulcre he lyethe, resort unto him, sue for mercy,
call for grace, ask forgyuenes, enter into his wounds by a secrette
meditacion, by a devout remembrance. Humbly besekinge him yt thou may be
pertener of the meritis of his glorious passion: that his blood may washethe,
that his body may feed the, that his wounds may heel ye, that his passion
may save the, that his death may quicken the, that his passion may
bryngethe to his glory and joy eternal.

Knele down every man and woman in y^ place ye stand in: and under this
devout manner of conte^placio^ say eueryche of you.v. pater noster, v. Aues,
and oon credo, in honor of these wounds, in honor of this death, in
honor of this blood, in honor of this our lord God, which lyethe in
yondre sepulture. And if thou do this with an inteare love and with a high
deuocyo^, It is not I that can express the inward solace and comfort that
thou shalt have, nor ye grette grace that shall ensue: Thou shalt feel itt
thy self within the, but thou ca^ste not express hit. Thoue shalt feale a
lyghtnes in thy heart, a gladness in thy stomach, a joy in thy soul, a flamynge
love with in ye, a desiour to be with god: and god shall be with the. And the
more thy love and desyour is knyt in him ye more surely, thou haste him, the
more shall be thy inward unctions, ye more grace is with the, the ner god is unto
the. And the more thy love is in him, the more shall be thy devotion: the more
shall be thy comfort, ye more shallbe thy Joy, the more shall be thy reward:
her by grace, there by glory, which Jesus, that is veary love, that for love
of the, this has suffrede: grant the and us all the glory that he has
bought us unto by this his glorious passion. Amen
