Loves Solace; OR
The true lovers part,
and in his conclusion he shows his constant heart.
He still does praise her for her beauty rare,
And says there is none with her that can compare.
To a new Court tune called the Damask Rose.


THe Damask Rose nor Lilly fair,
the Couslip nor the Pancy,
With my true Love cannot compare,
for beauty love and fancy,
She does excel the rarest Dame,
in all the world that may be,
Which makes me thus extol her fame,
so sweet is the Less that loves me.
If I should speak of my true Love,
as I am bound in dnty;
She does surpass the gods abone,
in each degree for beauty,
Juno, Pallas, nor Venus fair,
shine not so bright and lovely,
There Is none with her that may compare,
so sweet is the Less that loves me.
When first I saw her peerless face,
I did admire her beauty,
And I did seek with heart and voice,
to offer her all duty,
Which willingly she did accept,
so kind and loving was she,
Which makes me thus with all respect,
say sweet is the Less that loves me.
Mars though he be the god of war,
could not so deeply wound me,
As Cupi^ with a little skarre,
which I have plainly shown you,
Boreas with all his blustering storms,
never pierst so sorely:
Cupids Arrows prick like thorns,
so sweet is the Less that loves me.
For her sweet sake I Will undertake,
any thing she requires,
To sail the Seas like Captain Drake,
whose deeds there is some admireth
What ever she commands is done,
so much her love does move me,
She is a precious Paragon,
so sweet is the Less that loves me.
Bright Cinthia in her rich Robes,
my Love does much resemble,
whose beauteous beams such rares affords
that makes my heart to tremble,
Yet is the Saint so chaste so rare,
which unto fancy moves me,
And makes my joys without compare,
so sweet is the Less that loves me.
Diana and her Darlings dear,
that lived in woods and valleys:
And spent her time so chaste and rare,
she with no mankind dallies:
Yet is she not more chaste than my Love,
I hope none can disprove me,
O no my mind shall nere remove,
so sweet is the Less that loves me.
Sweet Love adieu I pray be true,
and think of what is spoken,
Change not thy old friend for a new,
let not thy vow he broken,
Sweet Love I leave thee for this time,
for so it does behoue me,
But still my heart does me combine,
to say sweet is the Less that loves me.
The second part, To the same Tune.
The Maidens kind answer wherein she does agree,
That he shall be her Love, and none but only he.


MY love, my life, my ducke my dear,
now will I yield unto thee,
All thou have said I well did hear,
and now thy words does move me,
For to reply in answer kind,
and so thy self shall prove me,
I will not change like to the wind,
so sweet is the Less that loves thee.
Be thou my lovely Pyramus,
I Will be thy constant Thysbe,
And I am now resolved thus,
never to displease thee.
True love surpasses Craesus gole,
it is not thy wealth that moves me,
Hereafter let my love be bold,
and say sweet is the Less that loves me.
I Will prove as chaste unto my Love,
as ever could be any,
No fond inticements me shall move,
although I am urged to many,
I will endure for ever kind,
as it does best behoue me,
A truer Mate thou shall not find,
so sweet is the Less that loves thee.
My daily care shall always be,
only for to delight thee,
And I my self still will be she
that shall with joys unite thee,
I will shine bright at noone and night,
if I may so content thee,
Like Cinthia I will shine bright,
unto the Lad that loves me.
Do not despair my only dear,
let not vain thoughts torment thee,
Of my true heart have thou no fear,
nor do not thou absent me,
I will remain for ever sure,
though I a while did prove thee,
Till death depart I Will thine endure,
so sweet is the Less that loves thee.
No gold nor gain shall me obtain,
to fancy any other,
All those that seek my Love to gain,
their wishes I do smother,
I answer them unto their kind,
for so it does behoue me,
I will not change like to the wind,
so sweet is the Less that loves thee.
So Love adieu I pray be true,
I am thine own for ever,
The next time that I meet with you,
We Will not so soon dissever,
Although we part I leave my heart,
with him that dearly loves me,
It Is Hymen's bands must ease my smart,
and I am the Less that loves thee.
O my sweet love and only dear,
thou have renewed my pleasure,
Thou in my sight do more appear
than any earthly treasure;
I do rejoice much in my choice,
and so it does behoue me,
I Will sing thy praise with heart and voice.
so sweet is the Less that loves me.
