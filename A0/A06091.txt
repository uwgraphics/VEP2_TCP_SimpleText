1
AL England now be glad at ones,
With one heart mind and voice:
For now have we ye greatest cause
To sing and eke rejoice.
2
For God has brought his servant true
From troubles sore and great,
Put down the proud, and has the meek
In their just places set.
3
The Lord has turned his wrath and ire,
From us, out of his mind:
Beeholding us with countenance
Moast loving sweet and kind.
4
That God which might have rightwisely,
Destroyde us every one,
Has showed him self moast mercyful,
To healp us al alone.
5
He has regarded equity,
Treuth, justice, law, and right:
And overthrown and vanquisshed
The wrongful dealers might.
6
We looked al for pestilence
And vengeance at his hand,
And eke innumerable plagues
To come upon the land:
7
But now has he sent down his grace
And mercy from above,
And showed us undoubtedly
A token of his love.
8
We have full justly looked heeare
For death and ruins rife.
And now do we beehold and trust
A good and joyful life.
9
Yea, we that wear moast sorrowful,
Without a spreet or heart:
Within a quarter of an hour
Did quicken and reuert.
10
We which wear brought by servitude,
Vntrewth and wrong tobey:
Do truth and justice execute,
And put that wrong away.
11
We for our own great variaunce
Did forayne strangers fear,
Lest they through our discension hear
Might rule among us bear:
12
But now we shall with unity
Be able to withstand,
And vanquish al our enemies,
And drive such from our land.
13
Our kingdom which divided so
Could never long abide:
shall now in unity be kept,
And treason be espide.
14
And we that only looked for
Gods vengeance to us bent:
Have now his greatest benefyte
Which he to us has sent.
15
He doothe beehold us meryli,
And will continue still,
If we as servants to his truth,
Obey unto his will.
16
He saw that wickedness arose,
And bare his truth despite:
And now will he out of the land
Destroy the workers quite.
17
When time that none durst speak for truth,
Then he him self, so good
Has stepped forth, and opend al,
Tauenge the gyltlesse blood.
18
He sets and establyssheth
His servants in their right:
And overthrows the wicked sort,
For all their strength and might.
19
It is not armoure, harneyse bright,
Nor any weapon strong,
The strength that to the hands of men,
Or hoorses does belong:
02
Nor any power on the earth
That can prevail or stand,
But only God the Lord him self
Will have the vpperhand.
21
What can a fortress, castle strong,
Or bulwark else prevail:
Against the Lord that makes al?
In need these things will fail.
22
The lord beeholdes the hearts and minds
Of godly men full plain,
Which only seek that ryghtwysenesse
And equity may raygne.
23
How wondersly doothe God with us
His people England deal?
Such joy as we scarce looked for
Among us to reveal.
24
He healps ye captives out of prison,
Breaks the walls of stone:
And riddes his chosen from the death,
And peryls every one.
25
Our comfort is come near, and eke
Our prayer heard, I trust:
Of God which in the heaven dwelles,
And fyghteth for the just.
26
For he has set and stablysshed,
Our worthy soueraygne:
And our liege Lady, Marie Queen,
On us by truth to raygne.
27
He has us sent a comforter,
To be our healp and guide:
With pity and with virtues al
Endewd on every side.
28
The lawful, just, and rightuouse,
Of England, head, and Queen:
To be the true enheritoure,
As has her brother been.
29
Not clayming by collusion,
Nor cloking it by sleyght:
But by her birth, descending from
Her godly father straight.
30
She being eldest sister right
Unto our sovereign Lord,
King Edward late the syxt by name,
Whose strength was gods true word.
31
For which moast godly impe and bud
Of Iessees stock and root,
Though we have almoost cause to sighe,
And sorrow be our boot:
^^
^Yet are we comforted again,
Lift up, and eke erect:
^ycause the Lord has placed thus
His chosen and elect.
^^
Which being our moast godly Queen,
That seeks our preseruacio^:
No doubt will strongly buyld upon
Her brothers good fondacion.
34
The ground work he has laid him self,
And she is left a lon,
To buyld the house, and fortress up
Of true religion.
35
O England now continue still,
In mirth and joy therefore:
For God will strengthen day by day
Your gladness more and more.
36
Our soueraygne and rightioyse Queen
Will vice and syn depresse:
Will cheafly love the church of God,
And punysh wickedness.
37
The Lord almighty grant that she
May prospere to succeed:
To have on us moast quiet raygne,
And healp her in her need.
38
The Lord destroy her enemies,
And make her foes bewrayde:
To be soon catched in the snare,
That they for her have laid.
39
Defend her, Lord, and eke al those,
That bear to her good heart:
And grant that from thy holy word,
She never swerve ne start.
40
Then doubtless al, both old and young
Shall praise thy name for ever:
And sing in Psalms to thee on earth,
Which do forsake us never.
41
Lord save our Queen moast graciouse
From euel and from fear:
The Lady eke Elizabeth,
Her godly sister dear.
42
Lord God preserve the noble men,
From dangers il and crime:
And send us peace and quietness,
In this same later time.
43
Al glory be to God therefore,
The father and the sone:
And also to the holy ghost,
In deitye but one.
44
As it has been from al beginninges
Unto this before:
As now it is, and from this time,
Shall Be for evermore.
A godly Psalm in meetre
by. T.B.
Psalm. 145.
1
O Praise the Lord (my soul and spreete)
So will I while I live,
Yea, sure as long as I remain,
I will him praises give.
2
Which healpeth them unto their right,
That bide and suffer wrong,
That feeds eke the hongry men,
And those that thirsted long.
3
The Lord from prison loses men,
And gives the blind their sight
The Lord doothe healp them up that fall,
And loves well the right.
4
He cares for strangers, widows he
Defendes and fatherless:
And ouerturnes the ways of all That work ungodliness.
Psalm. 146.
5
The Lord settes up and lifts those
That meek in heart are found:
And brings down thungodly men
From high unto the ground.
6
The legs of men delight him not,
Nor any horses strength
But those that fear him, and do trust
To have his grace at length.
Psalm. 148.
7
O praise the Lord ye kings and people
Dwelling on the earth:
Ye Princes and ye judges al,
Rejoice at ones for mirth.
8
Young men and maids, you aged men,
And children being young,
Exalt his name, and also let
His praises be your song.
FINIS.
