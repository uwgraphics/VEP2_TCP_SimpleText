The book to the Reader.
ALl ye that true catholyks be
And love our mother holy Church /
Make haste and come hither to me
I will teach you godly to wourche.
Doctrine both old and ancient
Of father Duns and friar Thomas /
Shall ye here find / if ye be bent
To believe in the blessed mass.
Of Christ and his holy Gospel
Of true faith / hope and charity /
I have nothing at all to tell
For that does not belong to me.
Of the mass is my whole matter
And of what great virtue it is /
If to know that / ye do desyer
Here in me ye shall it not mysse.
Away with your Communion
And with all your English service /
Come to mass with good devotion
For that will bring you to heavens bliss.
In that ye shall se your maker
Which made both heaven and earth so round
Come therefore with all humble manner
That good Catholyks ye may be found.
Joan. 3. This is condemnacion / that light is come into the world / and men
have loved darkness more the^ light.
The resurreccion of the Mass.
The Mass speaks.
Esurrexi and adhuc sum tecum
May I now sing maugre mine enemies /
For to England again am I now come
After a most goodly and princely wi^e.
O^ / as one all dead and long hid in grave
And as one bayred from all honest company /
Yea / as a capon long pent up in the cave
Exiled have I been miserably.
From Rome I came / I can it not deny
A city in times paste most florishyng /
Of the famous Gods Idolatry
Had I without fail my first beginning.
Popes manny were my fathers / as stories tell
Eyghte hundred years they were in begetting me /
My mother thought my a daughter full fell
Seeing in so long time / she could not be free.
My mother Idolatry was common
To many a Pope in the mean while /
Yet trustye and true to that shaven nation
Was she always / and never them begyle.
And although so many holy fathers
Had to do with her at their pleasure /
Yet be ye certain that of none others
Was she known / so faithful did she endure.
As the holiness is incomparable
Of all my fathers at every hour /
So likewise great and inestimable
Is my mothers honesty / worship and honor.
Thus of noble parents was I at the last
Brought forth as a Goddess perfect and pure /
My virtue in all places did I forth cast
Of their salvation making men sure.
There is no disease in all the contrie
Whyther it be pockes / pyles / or other sickness /
But to heal it I have ability
Helping all kind of people in their distres.
Messeied swyne and mangye horses likewise
Do I cure / and chickens that have the pyppe /
A wynchester goose to heal is my gyse
No kind of disease do I ouerhyppe.
If ought be lost / I am very profitable
To bring it again to the true owner /
To give rain or fair weather / I am able
When soever to me men make their prayer.
If the housband be weary of his wife
Or else the wife weary of her housbande /
I cause the one to have but a short life
That each to other may be no more band.
Again / if that the maids do want husbands
Or young men's wives at any season /
They need not lope over many streets or lands
But haste to me with all expedicion.
I give housbandes and wives at my pleasure
to all people except my smered shauelynges /
Them by no means to marrye / can I endure
But to run a whoring above al things.
They may live / Sinon east, tamen cause
Like great common Bulls in every town /
From marriage therefore / I will have them fre
That their holy order may not come down.
Nothing defyleth me / but honest marryage
Whordome and adultery / I can right well abide.
I will therefore that my massers of every age
Do fle from matrimony at every tide.
My thorelynges to Rune / at large I think best
And their children to sit by other men's fire /
For so shall they always find most rest
And be most mete to serve my desire.
Moreover / to bold baudes and lusty lawyers
To rufflyng ruffyns and drousye dronckardes /
To Matthew make shifte / and such others
As depely love / both dyce and cards.
To Peri^rers / thieves and murtherars
To stinking Sodomites and adulterers /
To pollers / pyllers and usurers
Am I loving / kind and gentle euers.
I refuse (so gentle am I mo kyn^de of people
Be they never so wicked and ungodly /
Chiefly / if they will come to the sign of the steple
And like ghostly children hear mass devoutly.
The worse for God / the better for me
I am as common as the Barbours chair.
The trompet and I are like in each degree
The best of us / both can not lightly appayre.
Come to me who list / and they shall be sure
To have good success in all their doing /
For my virtue is great / if it may^ endure
And far surmounteth all earthely thing.
Thus ye se of what great excellencye
I am in every kind of matter /
There is no disease or maladye
But I have a salve for it ever.
And as I am for diseases profitable
And for all other things of the body /
So to help all kaynde of people I am able
If to come to me / they will them selfs apply.
Gold / silver / richesse / glory and honor
Fame / renoune / and worldly felicite /
House / land / lordshippe / village / town and bowr^
Do I give to all them / that come unto me.
Whatsoever in this world is contained
Is mine to give at mine own pleasure /
Fall down and worship me with hearts vnfayne^
And ye shall want no wordly treasure.
Therefore my Chaplens and servants dear
If these gifts ye will enjoy at my hand,
Look that ye every day mass do here
For it is good / I will you to understand.
Se that ye rise betimes in the morninge
With an heart defyrous to honor me /
And as soon as the Sexten does the bell ryng^
Look that in the church streyghtwayes ye be.
Take holy water / and cross your self in the forehea^
Make curtesy mannerly / and knele down devoutly.
Draw as nigh to the aultare as can be devised
And in all points behave your self solemnly.
Give good ear to that my chapleyn does faye
Although ye understand nothing at all /
Shake your head / and lift up your hands always
And fet che syghes also both great and small.
Be ever prayeng of your Aue Mary
For that is a prayer fullgracious /
Look that at the Gospel ye stand up manerly
And make curtesye at the name of Jesus.
The Gospel ended / knele down again
As wise as ye were before ye stood up.
For to stand long it were to much pain
Chiefly if it were late / when ye did suppe.
But when my Chaplei^ come to the heauing
Of that little great God above his head /
Look that then mekely ye fall to crouching
Lifting up your hands with heart unfeigned.
Cry out O my Lord and my Savior
In the alone is all my confidence /
I will magnifye the at every hour
For thou art a God of most excellence.
Look that ye honor this God above all things
Which is halden up between the priests hand /
For he is a God of Pope Innocents making
The third of that name / I do you to understand.
Pope Nicolas also and pope Urban
Did much help to the perfection of it /
So did friar Thomas that pratye man
And many other mo / as it is fyt.
Think that these words, Hoc est corpus meum
Be of so great strength / virtue and power /
That they are able to make Gods own son
To come from heaven in the minute of an hour.
And although ye both se / feel and tas^e bred
Yet must ye needs believe the contrary
For holy Church has full determined
That it is Christ's natural body.
And though it be worm eaten / furyed or moulde
And so ^ryncke / that noman can it abide /
Yet our mother holy church would
Ye should believe it God both back and side.
And although it be against the nature
Of the Sacrament to be Christ's natural body /
Yet must ye believe it both steadfast and sure
According to pope Innocents decree.
And albeit Christ and holy writ do say
That Christ's real body is in heaven only /
Yet se that ye be s^oute / and say always
That in the Sacrament it is really.
And albeit it fights with the verite
Of Christ's body real and natural /
In many places at one time to be
Yet the contrary believe you shall.
And although Christ and his Apostles all
With the old Doctors and reason does persuade /
That it is not Christ's body natural
Yet say ye / it is very God that all made.
And steke you strongly to the determinacion
Of our mother holy Church Catholycke /
And if any be of contrary opinion
Burn him out of hand like an heretycke.
Se that ye continue always in this faith
That the Sacrament is Christ's natural body /
Flesh / blood and bone / as pope Nicolas says
And in this faith remain till ye dye.
And what if you for thus believing
Go to the Devil my great gra^dde father /
Fear ye not / my Chaplens for you shall sing
And never leave till they you deliver.
For I am so mighty that I am able
Even damned souls to dispatche out of hell /
Craianus storye prouyth this veritable
Which by me was releued / as they do tell.
Therefore ye my dear and loving massehunters
When soever my chaplens holy and devout /
Heave up that little great God / se that ye euers
Fall to knocking and kneling round about.
Again / when the chalice / bleste might it be
Is holden up above the priests head /
Lift up your hands and eyes / that all may s^
Ye be devout people and well disposed.
In the holy chalice ye shall understand
Is Christ's very true and natural blood /
Therefore to honor that also are ye bond
For the holy Popes have so thought it good.
After that ye have seen that godly syghte
Fall to prayer again devoutly.
Serve some good saint with all your might^
Either with a Pater noster or Aue mary.
But hear ye? when the second sacrye comes
And your God is da^dled about the chalice /
Look that then ye starte up with good devotion
And to honor your God most humbly deuyce.
Look upon that new found God earnestly
Worship him / honor him / and reverence him to,
Believe him to be your Savior only
Your redemer and mediator also.
Again / when the Paxe is carried about
Se that ye kiss it with all humilite /
All the mass time look ye appear devout
That ye may seem good Catholykes to be.
When the priest comes to s. Ihons Gospel
And blesses him as he were wood /
Do ye so likewise / for I plainly you tell
Against wicked sprites it is very good.
When the priest has once said, Deo gracia^
And kys^e the aultare in s^ead of a woman /
Than may ye well know / that done is the mass
And home may ye go / as wise as ye came.
But before out of the Church ye depart
Look ye take holy water fool devoutly /
Sprynckle your self with that from the very heart
And make a cross in your forehead solemly.
All these things once done with good devotion
Ye may do that ye will all the day after
For ye have offered to God such an oblacion
That ye can not anger him in any matter.
Now may ye fall to bollyng and bibbing
To dysing / to carding and to whorehunting /
To polling / to pilling / and to falls brybing
To quarelling / to fighting / to scolding and chydinge.
What ye list / that do / and be not afraid
For amends is made by hearing of mass
All things aforehande be all ready paid
Fear not / for I have set you in a good case.
Let this than be your daily exercise
First in the morning to hear mass devoutly.
And afterward whatsoever ye practice
It shall come to pass / I warrant you / luckely.
My power is wonderfull^ my virtue is great
My dignite passes all things mortal /
In me / in me alone is all goodness ^et
Therefore now unto me let all men fall.
Thus have I declared to you partly
What profytes ye massehunters get by me /
But know ye / that not for the body only
But for the soul also I serve in each degree.
The souls that lie burning in Purgatory
Miserably puling for want of soccure /
By me they are redeemed spedely
And brought out of their pain in half an hour.
The mass of Requiem is of great strength
When for a soul it is either song or said /
It always helps without fail at length
Though the soul with sin / be never so decade.
A trentall of masses is very profitable
For a soul departed at every season /
For that unto glory without any fable
Will bring the soul with all expedicion.
But not for purgatory souls only
Am I profitable and stond in s^ead /
The souls also / which in hell fire do lie
Are often by me from their pains redeemed.
Unto the very helles does my virtue pearce
When for any soul I am song or said /
Satan that tyraunte / both cruel and fearce
Is of me and my power greatly afraid.
My noble presence makes the deuell to rore
And all the flames of hell shortly to quench /
My royal presence causes evermore
All the infernal pains quickly to stenche.
Yea / from the dongeon of hell to heaven so hye
Do I cause the damned souls for to ascend /
To me / to me therefore let all men apply
If to come to glory they do intend.
By me the souls of saints in heaven also
Are lauded / praised and magnifyde /
As the mass of Gaudeamus omnes in domino
Does right well declare at every tide.
God and our Lady with the good saints all
Apostles / martyrs / confessors and virgins /
With all the holy Angels seraphicall
By me do rejoice / as most loving twynes.
Thus ye se in Purgatory / heaven and hell
I raygne as a most tryumpha^t Empress /
So that to them / that in those places do dwell
My virtue does extend both more and les.
What shall I speak of my beneficence
Toward the souls of them that be mortal /
To save their souls / I am of great excellence
When soever on me they earnestly call.
My Chaplens / through me offer daily
For all such as with money do them hyre /
An holy sacrifice propiciatory
And so deliver their souls out of the mire.
The sins of the whole world / through me
Are clearly remitted and put away /
My mighty power is to make them all fre
Which for remission of sins, money do pay.
Whatsoever sin is committed
Be it pride / whordome / theft or blasphemy /
By me it is utterly dispatched
And the sinners made both pure and holy.
For clensyng of the soul / noman does need
To seek after any other Physician /
Be that list unto me / for to make speed
Shall have of me a sufficient purgacion.
As men daily do grievously offend
So must they have a daily sacrifice /
To be rydde of your sins / if ye entend
To haste unto me / ye must needs device.
For in me / my marked merchants each on^
Offer up Christ the son of God daily /
They crucifye him again / though he be go^^
And offer a sacrifice Propiciatory.
And the sacrifice that they do offer
Is of so great efficacy / might and pour
As that which Christ offered to his father
When he hanged on the Cross at the last houre^
By Christ's death / the sin original
Was only put away / as many hold
But I dispatche all sins universal
As witness my Chaplens / both stout and bold.
Folish are they therefore / that take thought for sy^
As though it were a burden intolerable /
^eyng for a little money they may win
Forgyuenes of sins / and become vnculpable.
When the mass begyues / they may be synnefull
But before the mass be perfectly ended /
My smered Chaplens / all sin from them shall pull
And make them to be thoroughly saved.
For the blessed mass is not so sone said
Of the massinge Chaplens at the altar /
But all the debtes for sins are wholly paid
And they brought again to Gods fauer.
Thus in heaven / earth / hell and Purgatory
I rayg^e as a most triumphant Goddess /
All things are blessed by me / and made wealthy
Delivered from sorrow and all discresse.
Again / what a number of idle bellyde priests
Besides monks / heremites / Chanons and friars
Do I feed / to be makers of Christ's
Which otherwise should fall into the briars.
I make them to be had in reputatcion
I make them to sit highest at the table.
I make them to be called Syrs / every one
I make them worshipful and honorable.
I make them in their apparel to be
Galaunte and pleasant in every man's syghte
I make them greatest in every degree
I make them makers of God almighty.
I make them to walk in goodly long gounes
With typpet^es of sarcenet about their necks
I make them to wear forked cappes on their shaue^ crounes
I make the^ to do what they list without checkes.
I make them of the labor of other men's hands.
To live idely like men of great substance /
I enryche them with gaye houses and lands
I make them to live all in pleasance.
I make them in love with other men's wives
I make their children to sit by other men's fyres /
I make them to lead pleasant and wealthy lives
Even according to their hartye despres.
I make them searchers of all men's secrets
Through holy auriculare confession /
I make them to play many praty feats
And yet few spy their abhominacion.
By me alone they maintain their whoring
Their horses / their hauckes / their hondes and their spa^nels /
By me alone have they their pleasant living
Bunning here and there / or where they list else.
I make the order of priesthood honorable
I only / am the s^aye of all massemongers /
It is I that make the mass priests able
To match with the best / and to be called masters.
If I were not / they should have many euel happes
If I were not / their gouns should sone be threde bare
If I were not / their hair should grow through their carpes.
If, were not / they should have both carcke and care.
I would therefore that noman should marvel
Though massingpriestes do stoutly hold with me /
For they are certain / and do know right well
That the best flower of their garlande I must be.
Therefore when ye hear the^ loud lie at Paul's cross
As many in their sermons have done of late /
Blame them not / for they have had a longlosse
Therefore it is now hye time for them to prate.
Masses / Purgatory and prayeng for the dead
Are the chief pyllers of their popish kingdom /
If these three things were once abrogated
Then come they streyghtwayes unto confusion.
I wolde^ therefore / that my chaplens should prate hard
For these three things above all other /
Or else their kingdom shall never go forewarde
By sweet saint Mary / Christ's own mother.
For holy auriculare confession
I would have them also prate hard / hard / hard
For if they have not that popish inuencion
Their market will be altogether marde.
By that they shall know all men's secrety
By that / they shall sit as Gods in men's conscience
By that they shall bring the people wonderfully
Into all submission and obedience.
By that they shall make Lords to the^ for to lout^
Ladys and gentlemen shall they bring under /
By that as Gods they shall raygne round about
And know where stuff is against the next year.
Thus have I told you part of my virtues
And what I am able to do in every place /
I suppose ye think them very strange news
Yet shall ye find them true by our Lady of grace^.
My massing chaplens and the massehunters
Know these things too be true that I have spoken /
Their diligent coming to the mass euers
Is hereof a very manifest token.
Oh / sometime here in England gloriously
I raygned as a Goddess supernal /
Till Gods word / in the time of king Henry
Began to be known in places over all.
Through the scripture and other treatises
With the sermons of diverse learned men /
To be espied began my fantasies
So that many to me did not greatly lean.
Yet through the s^outenes of some prelates
Which ever loved me for my fathers sake /
I still continued among my pyldepates
And the most part of men did me well take.
Notwithstanding / my people religious
As monks / chanons / heremites / nonnes and friars /
Began among the people to be odious
And were called hypocrites and liars.
Their hypocrisye and feigned holiness
Came to light every day more and more /
Their unchaste chastity also certes
Made all good people them to abhor.
Their abominable life was so manifest
Besides all their wicked Idolatry /
That all godly men together thought it best
All their houses to suppress utterly.
Suppreste they were unto my great discomforte
And both the I and they at the doors thruste out /
Few had we then / that would us supporte
So were we compelled to range about.
Yet in paryshes and churches cathedral
In colleges also was I s^yl mayntayned /
There I found favor / what soever did befall
And among them was I greatly commended.
Yet was my courage wonderfully slain
To se me out of the monasteries exiled /
For I thought always / I should have been feign
Out of this realm shortly to have fled.
For many began my iugling to perceive
And what an enemy I was to Christ's blood /
They said I should no longer them deceive
Therefore to banishe me / they thought it good.
And without doubt so had it come to pass
If the stout prelates had not styked hard to me /
But they humbly kneled before the kings grace
And said / it were ^etie, it should so be.
Many reasons out of duns and dorbel
They brought forth in the parliament house /
But out of Gods word never a deal
No / not so much as was worth appylde lous.
Yet their reasons went for payment amo^nge them
And I found by act of parliament /
To be necessary ad salutem
For the quick and dead / a godly intent.
At the making of the.vi. articles done was this
A right good parliament for my shauelinges /
If that might remain / we should never do amys
But evermore rule like Lords in all things.
Now was it made both burning and hanging
To speak against me or that little great God /
No better could I have had it by wishing
Than for these new fellows to have such a rod.
Now thought I my self in a goodly case
And so sure / that I should never decay /
Every mancalled me the most blessed mass
And waited on me like a Goddess always.
Iraygned / I rule / I was in my ruff.
I was song / I was said in every cost /
Man / wife and child called me pure good s^u^fe
And magnifyed me to the vttermoste.
Well was I till certain of the new learning
Began to sturte up after their old fashion /
Against me and the little great God speaking
Calling us both horrible abhominacion.
Then began my buttocks for fear to quake
I thought my destruction to be at hand /
But the prelates did the matter up take
And those heretykes stoutely withstand.
For shortly they burnt them / as their wont is
So vehement and whote is their charity /
Thinking by this means to do hye service
Unto Gods most excellent majesty.
Somewhat chered again after that I was
And rayned like a Goddess most nobly /
Yea / I was in a wonderful good case
Till the death of that mighty king Henry.
After his death I began to wax faynte
For I that before was taken for a goddess /
Could not now be admitted for a saint
An Idol to call me / they did not cease.
A sacrifice propiciatory
Was I before / both for the quick and dead /
Yea / and that no salutem necessary
By act of parliament adjudged.
Now am I proved no sacrifice at all
But a plain enemy to Christus passion /
A Maum^t and Idol they do me call
Worthy to be brought unto utter confusion.
In the beginning of king Edwardes raygne
They called me first to examination /
My self I did so slenderly maintain
That all men might se my weak foundation.
For of Gods word I have no ground at all
That plainly does condemn me the truth to tell /
At Rome had I my first original
Of a number of Popes / as it befell.
Clouted and patched like a beggars cloak
Was I / God knows / foul evil fauoredly /
Rags they brought out of their popish poke
And cobled them on me after their fansy.
What mine own name mean / I can not declare
No / the papists them selfs can it not define /
Although herein they have taken full great care
And would very gladly the truth out fine.
This word missa has been diligently sought
And yet can they not find / whereof it come /
They study about a matter of naught
This am I certain / that I came from Rome.
First when I was at the bar arraygned
A certain simple maid / called the communion /
Before all the company / me grievously accused
And laid to my charge much abhominacion.
She called me a thief and a God robber
An harlot and a spiritual whore /
Saying that I and my massers together
Had utterly driven Christ out at the door.
Ye take upon you / quod she / to offer sa^^ifice
For the sins / both of the quick and the dead /
Which only pertayneth to Christ's office
As by the scriptures it is clearly proved.
Ye corrupt the words of the Lords supper
And add of your own imaginacion /
Ye rehearse them also in hocker mocker
That the people have no edificacion.
Ye set up a strange God to be worshipped
Made of bread / like unto a waffer cake /
Of wicked pope Urban / this have ye learned
And thus the true living God do ye forsake.
The Sacrament of Christ's body and blood
By you Antichrists is defiled utterly /
Marchandyse ye make of it / as ye were wood
And daily to your chapmen ye sell it for monye /
The congregation / by Christ's appoyntement
In perfect love should receive it together /
But to eat it alone is your intent
Standing like filthy swyne at the altar.
To the good plain people ye turn your backs
And play many a pratye iugling cast /
Brandon the iuglare had never goodlyer knackes
Than ye have at your mass / both first and last.
At your mass ye mock ye mow / ye breath / ye blow
At your mass ye kiss / ye lycke / ye knele / ye knock /
At your mass about the chalice your God ye throw
And dandle him up and down lyken Robyn Rodocke.
At your mass / like charmers and coniurers
Ye make your crosses for fear of sprites /
At your mass ye bless often with your greasy fyngers
I think it be for avoiding euel syghtes.
At your mass ye stand nodding in your meme^to
Like Bedlem iackes / clean out of your wits /
At your mass like shackled geese ye hoppe to and fro
Now standing / now kneling / as it come by fyttes.
At your mass like chuffes ye eat and drink alone
Clean contrary to Christ's institucion /
The people look upon you / but they kan get none
Which doubtless / is a great abhominacion.
At your mass / ye suppe and suppe / and still ye suppe
Till that ye leave nothing at all behind /
Than bless ye the people with an emptye cup
And send them home / both ignorant and blind.
At your mass / God is openly blasphemed
At your mass / Christ's blood is dishonored /
At your mass / all Idolatry is committed
At your mass / the Lords supper is defiled.
At your mass / the simple people are blinded
At your mass / many blasphemies are done /
At your mass / all good men with sorrow are filled
At your mass / the deuels in hell have delectation.
All good men utterly abhor the mass
All good men will not be present at it /
All good men cry out upon her and alas
All good men wish her hence for to flit.
Where the mass is / there is no true religion
For it is the head spring of all Idolatry /
Where the mass is / there is all supersticion
Wickedness and abominable hypocrisy.
None is to be found so common an whore
So notable an harlot / so stout a strompet /
As the mass is / though she go from door to door
With thousa^des in one day to meddle / she will not let.
Who therefore wayeng these abhominacions
Will not consent to ba^nish the mass /
Seeing she is so full of supersticions
And set Gods people in so damnable a case.
If ye love God / his word and Sacrament
Bannishe this whore away from among you /
Let her no longer be here permanent
Lest worser plagues do here after ensew.
Bannishe her / and away with her aulters
Down with the pyxs that hang sohye /
Your copes and vestimentes with all such matters
Away with them as things of vilanye.
After she had on this wise told her tale
To bannishe me all with one voice did consent /
I spoke / but nothing could I prevail
To conclude / unto Rome streighwayes I went.
Pope Paul welcomed me very heartily
So did the Bishops and Cardinals each one /
To whom / when I had told my matter playul^
Aue Maria / they made wonderful moan.
Full suerely they culled and kyssed me
And badde me be on a good conforte /
Though the whole world / daughter do forsake the
Yet will we / said they / still the supporte.
Their words / I tell you / warned me at the heart
As though it had been gynger of the best /
I was glad / those fathers did not from me starte
For with them yet I thought / I should have rest.
After this came monckes / chanons and friars
Nonnes / heremites / anckers and anckresses /
All these welcomed me with goodly attyers
And made of me even as if a goddess.
Moreover / bold baudes and lusty lawers
Ruffling ruffyns / and drousye dronkardes /
Pollers / pyllers / thieves / and murders
With all such as love both dyce and cards.
Periurers / usurers / brybe takers also
Papists / sodomytes / hypocrites likewise /
With all the rabble of noughtye packes to and fro
All these swarmed about me after their old gyse.
They welcomed and welcomed me again
Joyful they were to behold my visage /
Many of them said / I had taken great payn^
Seeing I had come so long a viage.
In Rome I tarryed a certain space
To se what favor the people bare to me /
With the godly wise I had but little grace
They judged me a very Idol to be.
I hear also / that in France and Italy
Such as to the studies Theological /
Do their minds unfeignedly apply
Set by me and my chaplens nothing at all.
In Polelande also / Portingale and Spain.
In Flaunders / Scotland and in many realms mo /
I am like shortly to have but little gain
For many of them begin from me to go.
What shall I speak of Denmark and Germany
With many noble contryes and cities beside /
They all have forsaken me utterly
And are gone from me / both far and wide.
They that the Gospel truly understand
And by the light thereof espy my iugling /
Will no longer unto me be bond
But fle from me / as from a pestilent thing.
So that besides mine old customers
Which to you heretofore I rehearsed /
I have neither friends nor yet lovers
That favor me with hearts unfeigned.
And yet as I hear / some of my old acquayfau^ce
Begin to fall from me daily more and more /
Which is to me certes a great greuaunce
And will hereafter prove to a foul sore.
The end I before see evidently
I shall surely be bannished at / the last /
For many do now myiugling espy
So that out at the doors I must be cast.
Every plant that my heavenly father
Has not planted / says Christ in the Gospel /
Shall be plucked up by the roots for ever
Though the world be never so wood and fell.
Of God am not I planted without doubt
A daughter I am of the Popes begetting /
Therefore must I also be rooted out
When the time does come of Gods appoyntinge.
Even as other fantasies of men are gone
So must I follow / will I / nyll I /
We shall all trudge by one and by one
That God alone may have all the glory.
We may through the help of hypocrites
Flourish daily / and prosper for a while /
But yet shortly shall we not be worth.iij. mytes
Be judged of the people in every isle.
Remembringe these things / it makes me agaste
And so does it all my smered shorelinges /
No maruayle / for then is all our glory paste
And we may walk like a sort of staruelinges.
Thus was I in a great perplexit^e
Although at Rome among my holy fathers /
Fearing always some great calamity
To chance unto me and to my mas^ers.
Yet how friendly the deuel was to me / marcke
Being in great trouble / not knowing where to stand
One came post haste to me / and said harcke / harcke
O good news / good news out of England.
I stood still / what is the matter qood^?
Edward the syxte / king of England is dead /
Which bannished wicked Idolatry^
And all popish abhominacion suppressed.
Being astonished with these sudden news
I asked of him / if these tydinges were true /
Yea / that they are / quod he / by the king of Jews
And that shall the Gospelers shortly rue.
A sort of the preachers are cast in prison
Some in the tower / and some in the marshal seas /
Some in the flete / and some in the dongeon
But from preaching / all sort of them doceas.
None preach now but papists with their shaven crounes
They bear the route in every pulpet /
They tru^ge up and down in their long gounes
And making merry / in every tauern they sit.
And whereof do they prate / preach I would (...)
Not of Christ nor of his holy Gospel /
But of the little great God they prate alway^
Which among them / chiefly bears the be^.
The Sacrament of the aultare / says each one
After the words of consecracion /
Is Christ's own body / flesh / blood and bone
But how^ye may not ask such a question.
It is enough that the church catholic
Has so determined the matter /
Who says the contrary is an heretyke
And remediles must be brent with fire.
They talk also of pick put se purgatory
Declaring what aterrible place it is /
And have all men's souls must therein frye
Before they can come to heavenly bliss.
The hypocrites again stoutely do prate
Of prayeng to saints in our aduersite /
As though Christ were not an able advocate
To help as in all our misery.
Of images to be lay men's kalenders
They babble very often in their sermons /
Wys^hing them to be set up as teachers
In all temples and congregacions.
Against the marriage of priests they prate hard
But clean without the holy scripture /
They would gladly have that go backwarde
That in their whordome they might still endure.
For holy aurieulaxe confession
They all take on / as though they were wood /
In must this come with all expedicion
Dr else / say they / we shall never do good.
What shall I hold you / said the tidinges bringer /
With many words or with a long tale /
There was no kind of papistrie ever
But in England it is like to have good sale.
Therefore Lady mass / if ye will do well
Make haste into England with all speed /
Friends shall ye have plentye / I you tell
Which will stand by you in all your need.
Ye shall have ready against your coming
Aulters bylte up in most goodly wise /
And your priests ready to fall a iugling
After their old and accustomed gyse.
For long before my coming away
Masons were sent for in every place /
Lyme / sand / mortar / stone and claye
Were fetched into the churches apace.
Aultare clothes / corporasses and cruettes
Copes / vestementes / albes / book / bell and chalice /
Candelstickes / pare / and such other trynckettes
Be in a redines after the best wise.
Therefore haste / post haste / and haste for your life
Never stynte / till that England yese /
The papists shall ye there find very ryfe
Which will receive you with sport and gle.
To the holy father I hasted a pace
To take my leave of him with all humilite /
Whom I found in a very homely place
As me thought / not semely for his degree.
I perceive well / all is not gold that thine
Many speak against priests matrimony /
Which do them selfs to much leudned incline
Like stinking Sodomites most fylthie.
But let this thing pass / I boldly stepte in
As a daughter / worthy such a father /
To declare the matter / I did begin
After a most humble and obedient manner.
My tale told / he greatly rejoiced
As one that had much noble treasure found /
Once again to his play fellow he turned
And said / all our things will be well and sound.
Is England come to this cases to this case?
Which heretofore did us so greatly despise?
What / will she have aga^n our daughter mass?
Salve festa dies / I like well this gyse.
My Indulgenses and pardons shortly
Will take place / I trust / with toties quoties,
My bulls / my wax / my lead and such pelfrye
To bring us home monye / shall not now cease.
If I might once again be admitted
Supreme head of the church of England /
Will they / nyll they / by me they should be ruled
I would make them peasauntes / and unto me ba^de.
Well daughter / make haste / and to England go
Commend me to my friends / both loving and dear /
Apply your matters both to and fro
That shortly good news I may from you here.
Thus I departed from his holiness
And went to other of mine acquaintance /
Whom my newse did so wonderfully please
That it filled their hearts with joy and pleasau^ce.
Biddinge them fare well / to England I hasted
Oh / what oratoure is able to expres /
How joyful I was here received
Welcome / welcome / they cried with great gladness.
Bishops / priests and quondam religious
I mean monks / nonnes / chanons and friars /
With all other people supersticious
Were as glad as birds upon briars.
All papists and all hypocrites again
And all godles people made wonderful sport /
Of my return / they were maruelously feign
Saying: my sight did them greatly conforte.
There was tossing of pottes / and maki^g good there
Dancing and leaping for the best game /
Drouncelettes were heard both far and nere
And many parts playde clean out of frame.
Mass is come / mass is come / they openly cryde
Of souls and bodies the alone savior /
Let us now rejoice on euerysyde
And the holy mass / both worship and honor.
Thus of my coming / all degrees were glad
I mean all those that love the pope of Rome /
Only the Gospellers seemed to be sad
And like people that were utterly undone.
Streyghtways was I had to this and that aultare
Where I was honorably entreated /
All papists came to me both nere and far
But the true Christians me utterly abhorred.
They can not abide the sight of me
But call me fylthie Idol and Maumette /
From me / as from the pestilence they fle
And as many as they can also let.
But as for my old former acquayntaunc^
They be all mine both whole and sound /
If they may do ought / I have good affiaunce
That I shall never fall unto the ground.
Thus I that in sight lately was dead
Am risen again most triumphantly /
Christ's communion is n^w exiled
And I in place set as a goddess most hye.
My priests that before with hair were ouergrowen.
Are now both smoth and smircking shorelinges /
Their gotishe beardes be now away thrown
And their Cai^like crounes tri^med with shaueui^ges
Their py^de and threde bare gounes are away cast
Their greasy forked cappes are laid aside /
To se them so gaye / men are greatly agas^e
In all places now they so pleasantly glyde.
Money in their purses they have plentye
To mask / to mass they are so desired /
The Catholics for masses still do cry
By this means / my priests are greatly enryched.
As for the godly ministers certain
They are trounsed in every place /
Specially / if they be married men
Such find but little mercy and grace.
Fylthie whoring does the papists well please
Holy matrimony they can not abide /
To be married / they think it a disease
Not semely for priests at any tide
I doubt not / but my praters at Paul's cross
And other champions taking their part /
Will so from post to pillare them toss
That they shall have little ease at their heart.
I trust we shall so handle the matter
That priests from their wives shall be separate^
We also will them so spoil and beggar
That we shall bring them to a poor state.
Honest matrimony I can not abide
Massinge / and that can not agree together /
Married priests shall put their wijues aside
Or else be handled after an homely manner.
All preachers and favorers of the Gospel
We will surely bring as low as we may /
But all such maskers as masses do sell
We will promote and make them gaye.
I and my champions shall bear all the route
The protestants may go pycke a sallet /
We papists shall rule the roste round about
And no man so hardye against us for to set.
Thus shall I rule as a most noble goddess
We shall all people both worship and honor /
To extolle me my papists shall not cease
Speaking good of me at every hour.
But of one thing I must here give warning
To all my lovers / both faithful and dear /
That they be diligent in this one thing
To darcken the Gospel / that it shine not clear.
In siead of Christ's Euangely
Preach the real presence and transsubstantiacion /
Talk of pylgrimages and purgatory
Of images and saints intercession.
Preach iustificacion of works and fre will
Preach aurieulare confession likewise /
Preach that Gods law we are able to fulfill
Preach the masses / propiciatory sacrifice.
Preach ceremonies / holy bread and holywater
Holy wax / holy flax / and holy relics /
Holy oil / holy cream / and holy as^hes ever
Holy candels / holy fire / and holysalow sticks.
Preach against / at the least corrupt alway^
Whatsoever is found in the scripture /
That does the popish law against say
Though it be never so good / true and pure.
Against the alone justification of faith
Preach stoutely / and put will works thereunto /
Or else whatsoever the scripture says
Tell them / unto heaven they can not go.
To Christ's blood join the popes purgatory
Tell them / that after this life they must also /
Be purged therein from all their vilany
Or else unto heaven / bliss can they not go.
And here exhort all men of each degree
To pray devoutly for the souls departed /
With solemn Placebo and Dirige
And a mass of Requiem thereunto added.
Tell them it is very meritorious
And a good deed / so for the souls to pray /
Masses and Diriges make them full joyous
And cause their pains greatly to decay.
Tell them that Christ is not so our mediatoure
But we have need of some good saint also /
To be unto God our intercessoure
Or else unto heavens bliss can we not go.
Tell them / that auriculare confession
Devised by pope Innocent the third /
Is so necessary unto salvation
That without it / sins can not be remitted.
Tell the^ / that priests have power to forgive syn
When so ever they say, Ego absoluote,
Therefore / their sins to confess let them begin
And from all their sins / they shall sone be fre.
Tell them / that the gylding of images
And paynting of tabernacles also /
Has been greatly praised in all ages
And opens a way unto heaven for to go.
Tell them / that pylgrimage going likewise
Is very profitable for the soul /
Exhort them to bring in again that gyse
And to drink of s. Edmundes pardon boulle.
Tell them / that to be burried in s. Fraunces coule
Is very good for the souls salvation /
Though it be never so lousy or foul
As in their holy rule is made mention.
Tell them / that works done of a good insent
Avails no les unto salvation /
Then things appointed by Gods commaundeme^^
To be done of the Christen congregracion.
Tell them / whatsoever holy church bid
Though to the scripture it be clean contrary /
That of all men must be fulfilled
And never ask any question why.
Tell them / they must it think it sufficient
That holy church has so ordained /
And though it be not Gods commandment
Yet tell them / it must needs be obeyed.
As the Idolatrous priests in times paste
Cried / the temple of the Lord / the temple of the Lord /
So to cry / let it ever be your cast
The holy church / the holy church with one accord.
Deface the doctrine of the fore preachers
So much as ye can / to the vttermoste /
By calling them cobblers / tynckers and taylers
And unlearned asses in every cost.
But look ye call your selfs master doctor
And Graduate of the university /
Preach in your hoode / and set forth your honor
And so declare what learned men ye be.
As for Dorbel / Duns / Thomas and Tartar
Gabriel / Lombarde / master of the sentence /
Gorram / Alberte / and other of that se^te
Sa^e / ye have seen them though many years ^e^ce.
Tell them / that the doctrine which ye teach now
Is catholycke / old and old again /
Holy church did it always allow
And in their counsails ever it maintain.
Again I would have you like stout Nemroth
Cryeout at Paul's cross against the Printers /
Say / that they are the cause / that the world goes
So euel with our mother holy church eue^s.
Say / with their books they mar all the market
And fill the whole realm with heresye /
For to read those books / all the world is set
And to holy church will not them selfs apply.
^aye / that all the books that have been printed
Here in England / by the space of six year^ /
Are all with great heresies infected
And well worthy to be set on a fire.
The Catechismes / and the book of comm^ praye^
The Homilies and Articles also /
With all other books entreating of the scripture
Are worthy into the fire for to go.
Crieout / that all such books may be condemned
Either by an act of parliament /
Or else by proclamacion incalled
And so afterward to be shortly brent.
This thing shall auaunce my kingdom greatly
And set both you and me in a goodly stay /
Therefore I would have you the matter to apply
That it might be dispatched out of the way.
Furthermore / if there do any arise
Speakinge against me and my kyngedome
To lay hand on him streightwayes devise
And cruelly cast him into prysonne.
Manace him with words / both fearce and fell
Threaton him with faggot / fire and halter /
And to put it in use / ye shall do well
That other thereby may learn to fear.
I would not have you dispute with the scripture
But rather with halter / fire and faggot /
For these arguments are so strong and sure
That none of them all can undo that knotte.
By far means again / se what ye can do
Promise them a benefice or prebend /
Say / ye will be their hearty friends also
If they will become conformable and amend.
Thus by foul or fair means prove mas^rise
Though it be clean against your conscience /
And evermore / let this be your devise
To maintain me and my magnificence.
If ye will do after this mine advertisement
So shall both you and I right we^ prosper /
But if ye begin to be negligent
Then shall we sone perish altogether.
Therefore / if ye tender my dignite
My worship / my honor and my excellen^e /
Look that in these things diligent ye be
So shall ye long enjoy my presence.
Otherwise / I shall surely be so hunted
Of the protestants my fo^s mortal /
That to fle again / I shall be compelled
As a slave / both miserable and thraul.
And then shall ye also come down / down /
And ^e had no more in estimacion /
Laughed to scorn shall ye be with your shaue^ croune
And utterly brought unto confusion.
The cause why / I give you such a charge is this
It was told me of a friend sense my coming /
That the mass should be dryue^ out of England twice
And the second time shall be past all helpinge.
The mass at the first time shall recover
Her bannishment right well / quod that my friend^
But the second time shall be for ever
For bannished shall she be unto the end.
Again / ye know Christ's prophecye
Every plant that God has not planted /
Shall Be plucked up by the roots utterly
And be cast away / as a thing feigned.
Of God ceries have not I my foundation
But of a sort of popes patched together /
Therefore must I needs come unto confusion
Because my foundation is so slender.
I know also / there are a great number
Which come to me with very hollow hearts /
Wishing at the deuel / both me and my masses
For playeng such popish and iugling parts.
Such I tell you / are not to be trusted
Although outwardely they bear a fair face /
They do but look / when I shall be confounded
Then will they cry / down with her apace.
Furthermore / it stands you also in hand
To look upon this matter diligently /
For I do you all to understand
The cause is yours also and not mine only.
The papists / quod my friend / shall twice have a fall
In this realm of England certainly /
The first right well recover they shall
The second shall be without remedy.
They shall then of the people be so hated
That none shall vouchsafe to have the^ at their bourde
Yea / of them selfs they shall so be ashamed
That they shall cover their crouns with a cowtourd.
And then said he / is their utter destruction come
For after that time shall theey never more rise /
But Christ's gospel / even unto the dome
Shall in this realm florishe in most goodly wise.
Of our first fall / we have had experience
Of that we may well judge what shall follow.
Let us therefore takehede with all aduertence
For when that come / then begin our sorrow.
Watch therefore my chaplens and cha^pions stout
Take time / while the time have ye may /
Prye / spy / and diligently look about
For I tell you truth / the time will away.
Remember the lessons / that I have given you
Profitable they are for my kingdom /
Look that those diligently ye ensue
Than to good fortune may we hap to come.
We shall yet for a while triumph and raygne
We shall bear the rout / and donn with the Gospellers
We shall pleasantly our estate maintain
And of al men be counted ioly rufflers.
You as gentle men shall raygne in all contrise
I as a goddess shall be of great renown /
And by this means to sing I may devise
Resurrexi and adhucsum tecum.
Valete and Plaudite.
