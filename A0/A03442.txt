(...) Made by Antony Holborne Gentleman and Servant to her most excellent
Majesty

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL AND VIRTUOUS GENTLEMAN SIR RICHARD CHAMPERNOWNE
KNIGHT.
IN a continued observation of your virtuous constancy to the love of Music,
I have long and with great increase of reason honored you most gentle Sir: for,
even but part of my poor labors speaking in their kindly voice, from the
experience of many years can feelingly witness and sing with what grace-full
favors they have been nourished at your hands. With this regard, J have
distinctiuely bundled them up into a catologue volume, accompanied with a more
liberal and enlarged choice then has at any time as yet come to your refined
ears: and withal, have now made bold to present them as things not altogether
unnecessary to do you pleasing service, but also to live and dwell with you
under the protection of your good allowance, and the testimony of my
euer-bounden thankefulnes. And as they are in number many, so are they of
nature variable to please variable natures: and yet do they al meet in
consent hermonical deseruinglie to win your only good acceptance and
liking: wherein I shall hold my self richly satisfied, and ever rest.

Yours in all love and due reverence, Antony Holborne. Ni merear moriar
