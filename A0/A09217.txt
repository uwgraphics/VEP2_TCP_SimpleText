THE PREFACE.
IN Pablis town sum time as I heard ^ell,
The formest day of Februare befell:
Thrie Priests went unto collatioun,
Into ane privy place of the said town*
Quhair that they sat richt soft and vnfutesair,
They luifit not na rangald nor repair.
And gif I sall the suith reckin and say,
I traist it was upon Sanct Bryds day.
Quhair that they sat full easily and soft,
With money loud lauchter upon loft:
And wit e weil their thrie they maid good cheir,
To them their was na dainteis than too deir
With thrie sed cap^ns on a speit with creis^he,
With money v^her sindrie diverse meis:
And them to serve they had nocht bot a boy,
Fra cumpanie they keipit them sa coy,
They lufit nocht with la^ry nor with lown,
Nor with trumpours to travel throw the town:
Bot with them self quhat they wald tell or crak,
Vmquhyle sadly, vmqu^yle jangle and jak.
Thus sat their thrie beside ane fel^^^n fire,
Quhil their capons war rois^ic lim and lyre:
Befoir them was sone see a Roundel bricht,
And with ane clean claith fynelie dicht.
It was ouirset and on it bre^ was laid,
The eldest than began the grace and said
And blissit the breid with Benedice^e,
With Dominus Amen, sa mot I the.
And be they had drunken about a quarte,
Than spak ane thus that Master was in Art:
And to his name their callit Iohne was he.
And said senwe ar heir Priests thrie,
Syne wan^s nocht be him that maid the Moon,
Til us we think ane tail sold cum in tune:
Than spak ane other to name hecht M. Archebald,
Now be the hiest Heuin quod he I hal^.
To tell ane tailm^ think I sold not tire,
To hald my fute (...) of this fellou^ fire.
Than spak the third to name hecht S. Williame
To grit clargie I can not count nor clame.
Nor it I am not trauell^t as ar e,
In money sundry Land beond the Sea.
Thairfoir me think it nouther shame nor sin,
Ane of ow two the first ^ail to begin.
Heir I pr^^est than sp^^k. master Archebald,
Ane tau^l ^it Clark suppois I be called:
Presumpteouslie I think not to presume,
As I that was never trauellit bot to Rome.
To tell ane tail bot eirar I suppone,
The first tail tald mot be Master Iohne:
For he has been in money uncouth Land,
In Portingale and in Civil the grand.
In five kinrikis of Spane al hes he been,
In four christin and ane heathin I wene:
In Rome Flanders and in Venice town,
And other Lands sundry up and down.
And for that he spak first of ane tail,
Thairfoir to begin he sold not fall.
Than speiks Master Iohne now be the Rude,
Me to begin ane tail sen e conclude:
And I deny than had I sair offendit.
The thing begun, the sooner it is endit.
The first taill tald be Master Iohne.
A King their was sumtyme and eik a Queen
As money in the Land befoir had been:
This King gar^ set ane plane Parliament,
And for the Lords of his kinrik sent:
And for the weilfair of his Realm and gyde,
The thrie Estaits concludit at that tide*
The King gart call to his Palice al thrie,
The Estaits ilkane in their degrie.
The Bishops first with Prelates and Abbottis,
With their Clarks servants and Varlottis:
Into ane hall was large richt hie and hugde,
Their Prelates all richt lustily couth ludge.
Syne in ane hal full fair farrand,
He ludgit all the Lords of his Land,
Syne in ane Hal was under that full clean,
He har bourit al his Burgessis rich and been
Sa of their thrie Estaits al and sum,
In their thrie Hals he gart the wysest cum,
And of their merry cheir quhat make I mair,
They fuir als weil as onie folk micht fair.
The King himself come to this Burgessis been.
And their words to them carps I wene
And says welcum Burgessis my be^ld and blis,
Quhen e fair weil I may na mirths mis.
Quhen that our ships halds hail and sound,
In riches, gudes and weilfair I abound:
Ze ar the cause of my life and my cheir,
Out of far Lands our Marchandice cums heir.
Bot ane thing is for short the cause qu^y,
Togidder heir ow gart cum have I.
To ow I have ane questioun to declair,
Quhy Burges bairns thryues not to the third air.
Bot casts away it that their eldars wan,
Declair me now this questioun gif e can.
To ow I gif this questioun al and sum,
For to declair again the morn I cum.
Unto his Lords than cumen is the King,
Dois glaidlie al he said both ald and ing,
My lusty Lords my Leiges and my life,
I am in sturt quhen that e ar in strife.
Quhen e have peace and quh^n e have plesance,
Than I am glade and derflie may I dance,
And heid dow not on body stand allane,
For out members to be of micht and mane.
For to vphald the body and the heid,
And sickerlieto gar it stand in steid.
Thairfoir my Lords and my Barrouns bald,
To me al hail e ar help and vphald.
And now I will e wit with diligence,
Quhairfoir that I gart cum sik confluence:
And quhy e Lords of my Parliament,
I have gart cum I will tell my intent.
Ane questioun I have e mon declair,
That in my mind is ever mair and mair:
Quhairfoir and quhy and quhat is the cais,
Sa worthy Lords war in mine elders dayis,
Sa full of fredome worship and honor,
Hardy in heart to stand in every stour:
And now in ow I find the hail contrair,
Thairfoir th^^ dout and questioun e declair:
And it declair under the hiest pane,
The morn this time quhen that I cum agane.
THAN till his Clergy came this nobil King,
Wel^um Bishops he said with my blissing:
Welcum my be^dmen, my bless and al my beild,
To me e ar both Helmes Speir and Scheild.
For richt as Moy^es stude upon the Mont,
Prayand to God of Heuin as he was wont,
And richt sa ^y our deuoit Orisoun,
Mine enemies lould put to confusioun.
Ze ar the gamest ga^t and gyde to God,
Of al my Realm e ar the reul and rod:
It that e do me think it sold be done,
Quhen that e shrink I have ane sun^e sone.
Thus be ow ay ane e^ample men tais,
And as e say than al and sundry sayis:
It that e think richt or it ressoun,
To that can I nor na man have chessoun.
And that e think vnressoun or wrang,
We al and sundry sings the sam^^ sang:
Bot ane thing is I wald e understood,
The cause into this place for to conclude.
Quhairfoir and quhy I gart ow hidder (...),
My Clargie and my Clarks al and sum:
To ow I have na other tail nor theme,
E^cept and to ow Bishops a probleame.
Quhilk is to me ane questioun and dout,
Out of my mind I wald e put it out*
That is to say quhairfoir and quhy,
In auld times and days of ancestry.
Sa money Bishops war and men of Kirk,
Sa grit will had ay good warkes to wirk:
And throw their prayers maid to God of micht,
The dum men spak, the Blind men gat yair sicht.
The Deif men heiring, the Crukit gat t^air feit,
War nane in bail, bot weill they culd them beit.
To seik folks or into sairnes syne,
Til al they wald be mendis and medicyne.
And quahairfoir now in our time e wary,
As they did than* quhairfoir sa may not e,
Quhairfoir may not e as they did than,
Declair me now this questioun gif e can.
To the Burgessis.
UPON the morn after service and meat,
The King came in and sat down in his sait:
Into the Hal amang the Burges men,
With him ane Clark with ink paper and pen.
And bad them that they sold foroutin mair,
His questioun reid assole and declair:
And the Burgessis that this questioun weil knew,
Hes ordaned ane wise man and ane true.
The question to reid foroutin fail,
And he stude up, and this began his tail.
The ansvveir to the first questioun.
EXCELLENT hie richt michty prince and King,
Zour Hienes heir wald feign wit of this thing:
Quhy Burges bairnis thryuis not to the third air
Can never thryue bot of al baggis is bair.
And ever mair that is for to say,
It that their Eldars wan they cast away:
This questioun declair full weill I can,
They begin not quhair their fathers began.
Bot with ane hiely heart both daft and derft,
They ay begin quhair that their fathers left:
Of this matter largely to speik mair,
Quhy that they thryue not to the third air.
Because their fathers purelie can begin,
With hap and halfpenny and a Lambs skin:
And purelie ran fra town to town on feit,
And than richt often we^shod werie and weit.
Quhilk at the last of many smals couth make,
(...) bonte pedder ane good fute pak^*
At ilkane fair this chopman ay was fund,
Quhil that his pak was with forty pund.
To beir his pak quhen that he faillit force,
He bocht full sone ane mekil stalwart horse:
And at the last so worthelie up wan,
He bocht ane Cart to carry Pot and Pan:
Both Flanders Coffers with Counters and Kissed
He wox a grund rich man or onie wist.
And syne unto the town to sell and by,
He held a chop to sell his chaffery,
Than bocht he wol and wyselie couth it wey,
And after that sone saylit he the Sey:
Than come he hame a very potent man,
And spousit syne a michtie wife richt than.
He saylit over the Sey sa often and often,
Quhil at the last ane semelie ship he coft.
And worcester sa full of warldis wealth and win,
His hands he wish in ane silver Basin.
Forout^^ gold or silver into hurde,
With thrie thousand pund was his Copburde:
Rich was his gowms with other garments gay,
For Sunday silk for ilk day grene and gray.
His wife was cumlie cled in Scarlet reid,
Scho had na dout of derth of Ail nor breid.
And after that within a twenty eir,
His Sone gat up ane stalwart man and steir*
And after that this Burges we of reid,
Deit as we mon do al indeid.
And fra he was deid than come his sone,
And enterit in the wealth that he had wone.
He steppit not his steps in the streit,
To win this wealth nor for it was he weit.
Quhen he wald sleip he wantit not a wink,
Fra they be al puir that are them under,
Thocht they be puir, our Lords is na wonder:
For rich Husbands and tennants of grit micht,
Helps ay their Lords to hald their richt.
And quhen our Lords ar puir this to conclude,
They selthair Sons and aires for gold and good.
Unto ane mokrand Carle for derest pryse,
That wist never it of honor nor gentryse.
This worship and honor of lineage,
Away it weirs thus for their disparage:
Their manheid and their mense this gait they murle
For Marriage thus unity of ane churl.
The quhilk wist never of gentrice na honor,
Of fredome, worship, vassalage nor valor.
This is the cause dreidles for without in dout,
Fra al our Lords how honor is al out.
And thus my Lords bade me to ow say,
How honor, fredome and worship is away.
THAN spak the King our conclusion is quaint
And their a^tour e make to us a plaint:
And in our sentence thus e meine to say,
Leil men ar hurt and theifis gets away.
And thus me think e meine justice is smuird,
Zour tennants and our leill husbands ar puird,
And quhan that they ar (...), t^an ar e pure,
The quhilk to ow is both charge and cure.
That e for gold ^aith wed and wage,
Ze sell our Sons and aires Marriage:
To cairls of kind and bot for their riches,
In quhom is na nurture nor nobilnes.
Fredome, worship, manheid nor honor,
The quhilk to us and ow is dishonor.
In same kill thus shortly I conclude,
As e that are discendand of our blude.
For the quhilk thing I will e understand,
With Gods grace we tak it upon hand:
To se for this as ressoun^ can remeid,
In time to cum thairof their be na pleid.
With our justice their salpas ane Doctor,
That lufis God his saul and our honor:
The quhilk salbe aue Doctor in the Law,
That sal the faith of verity well know.
And fra hence forth he sal both heir and se*
Both theif puneist and leil men live in lie.
For weil I wait their can be na war thing,
Than Cou^eyce in Justice or in King.
After this tail in us e sal not taint,
Nor it of our Justice to make ane plaint:
And afterward sa did this King but chessoun*
On him micht na man plenie of ressoun.
Syne had his Clark but onie variance.
Wr^te this in his Buik of rememberance.
THAN to the Clergy came this nobill King,
Of his questioun to heir the absoluing.
And they as men of wisdom in all wark*
Had laid their speich upon ane cunning Clark.
The quhilk in vain in scule had not taken grie,
In all science seuin he was ane Aper se:
And in terms short and se^^^^ce fair,
The questioun began for to declair.
That is to say quhairfoir and quhy,
In auld times and days of ancestry.
Sa money Bishops war and men of Kirk,
Sa grit will h^d ay good warkes to wirk:
And throw their prayers maid to God of micht,
The dum men spak, the Blind men gat yair sicht.
The Deif men heiring, the Crukit gat their feit,
Was nane in bail, bot weil they could them beit.
And quhairfoir now all that cuir can wary,
Me think e mean quhairfoir sa may not we:
And thus it is our quodlibet and dout,
Ze gave to us to reid and gif it out.
The answer to the third question.
THIS is the cause richt michtie King at short,
To our Hienes as we sal thus report:
The Lawit folks this Law wald never ceis,
Bot with their use quhen Bishops war to cheis.
Unto the Kirk they gadred auld and ing,
With meik heart fasting and praying:
And prayit God with words not in waist.
To send them wit down be the halie Gaist.
Quhan them amang was onie Bishop deid,
To send to them ane Bishop in his steid.
And it amang us ar fund wayis thrie,
To cheis ane Bishope after ane other die:
That is to say the way of the halie Gaist,
Quhilk takin is of micht and vertew may.
The second is be way of Electioun,
Ane Person for to cheis of perfectioun:
In that Cathederal Kirk and in that se,
In place quhair that Bishope should chosen be.
And gif their be nane abil their that can,
That office weil steir, quhat sal they than?
Bot to the third way to ga for thy,
Quhilk is callit ( via scrutiui.)
That is to say in all the Realm and Land,
Ane man to get for that office gainand:
Bot their thrie wayis withoutin any pleid,
Ane sold we cheis after ane vthers deid.
Bot sit now the contrair we find,
Quhilk puts al our heaviness behind:
Now sal their nane of their wayis thrie,
Be chosen now ane Bishope for to be.
Bot than our micht and Majesty will make,
Quhat ever he be to loife or it to lak:
Than heyly to sit on the Rayne-bow,
Their Bishops cums in at the North window,
And not in at the dur nor it at the et.
Bot over Waine and Quheil in will he get:
And he cummis not in at the dur,
God pleuch may never hald the fur.
He is na Hird to keip they sely sheip,
Nocht bot ane Tod in ane Lambskin to cre^ip:
How sold be kyth mirakil and he sa evil,
Never bot bythe dysmel or the Devil:
For now on days is nouther rich nor pure,
Sal get ane Kirk al throw his literature.
For science for vertew or for blude,
Gets nane the Kirk, bot both for gold and good.
Thus greit excellent ^ing the halie Gaist,
Out of our men of good away is chaist.
And war not that doutles I ow declair,
That now as than, wald hail both seik and sair.
Sic wickedness this world is within,
That Symonie is countit now na sin.
And thus is the cause both al and sum,
Quhy blind men sicht, na heiring gets na dum.
And thus is the cause the suich to say,
Quhy halines fra kirkmen is away.
Than quod the King, weil understand I ow,
And heir to God I make ane aith and vow:
And to my Crown and to my Cuntrie to.
With Kirk-gude sal I never have ado.
I^ to dispone to lytil or to large,
Kirk men to kirk, se^ they have all the charge:
Than had this nobil King lang time and space,
And in his time was mekil luk and grace.
His Lords honor it him after their degrie,
The Husbands piece had and tranquillity.
The Kirk was fry quhil he was in his life,
The Burges Sons began than for to thryfe.
And after lang was never king more wise,
And leuit and deit, and endit in Gods seruise.
And than spak all that fellowship but fail,
God and Sanct Martyne quyte ow of our tail.
And than spak Master Archebald fallis me,
Good tail or evil, quhider that ever it be:
Thus as I can I sal it tell but hyre,
To hald my fute out of this felloun fire.
The second taill tald be M. Archebald.
A King their was sumtyme and eik a Queen,
As money in the Land befoir had been:
The king was fair in persoun fresh and fors,
Ane feirie man on fute or it on horse.
And nevertheless feil falts him befell,
He luifit over weil ong counsel:
Zong men he luifit to be him neist,
Zong men to him they war both Clark and Priest.
He luifit nane was old or full of age,
Sa did he name of sad counsel nor sage.
To sport and play quhyle up and quhylum down,
To al lichtnes ay was he ready boun.
Sa ouir the Sey, cummin their was a Clark,
Of greit science, of voice, word and wark,
And bressit him with all his besynes,
Thus with this king to make his recidens.
Weil saw he with this kiag micht na man bide,
Bot they that wald al sadness set on side.
With club and bell and party cote with eiris,
He feineit him ane fule fond in his feiris.
French, Dutche and Italy it als,
Weil could he speik and Latin feine falls.
Unto the kirk he came befoir the king,
With club and cote and money bell to ring.
Dieu guard sir king, I did nocht hald in hiddil,
I am to ow als sibas seif is to ane riddil,
Betwi^t us two mot be als mekil grace,
As frost and snaw fra Zule is unto Pace.
Watt ee how the French man sayis syne,
Null bon he sayis monsieur sans pyne.
With that he gave ane loud lauchter on loft,
Honor and eis, sir quha may have for nocht.
Cum on thy way sir king, now for Sanct Iame,
Thou with me, or I with the gang hame.
Now be sant Katherine quod the king and smyld,
This fule hes money waver and word and wyld,
Cum hame with me thou sal have drink ynouch.
Grand mercy quod the fuill agane and leuch.
Now quod the king fra al dulnes and dule,
We may us keip, quhil that we have this fuil,
He feineit him a fuil in deid and word,
The wyser man the better can he bourd.
Quhil at the last this fuil was callit always,
Fuil of fuiles, and that ilk man wald say.
Thus was this fuil ay still with the King,
Quhil he had weil considderit in all thing.
The conditions, use, manner and the gyse,
And coppyie weil the king on his best wise:
Sa fell it on a day this nobil king,
Unto ane Cietie raid for his sporting,
This fuil persauit weil the King wald pas,
Unto ane other Cietie as it was:
He tuke his club and ane babble in his hand,
For to preuene the time he was gangand.
Sa be the way ane woundit man faude he,
And with this fuil war runners two or thrie,
Sum of the Court and sum of the kitchene,
And saw ane man but Leiche or Medycene.
Sa sair woundit micht nouther ga nor steir,
At him this fuil can all the cause speir:
He answered and said reuer and theif,
Thou hes me hurt and brocht me in mischief.
With that his wounds war fillit full of fleis,
As ever in byke their biggit onie beis:
Than ane of them that had pity can pray^*
That he mot skar they felloun fleis away.
Than spak the fuil and said lat them be now man*
For they ar full the hunger will cum than:
For their dois nocht bot sits as thou may se,
For they ar als full as they may be.
Be their away it is evil and na good,
The hungry fleis will cum and souk his blude:
The ofter that their fleis away be chaist,
The new fleis will mair of his blude waist.
And draw his blude and souk him syne sa sair,
Thairfoir lat them allane, skar them na wair:
The sair man him beheld and ^im he demes,
And said he was not sik a fuil as he semes.
Sone after that ane lytil came the King,
With money man can gladelie sport and sing.
Ane cow of birks into his hand had he,
To keip than weil his face fra midge and fle.
For than war money fleand up and down,
Throw kind of eir and hait of that Regioun*
Sa lukit he ane lytill by the way,
He saw the woundit man quhair that he lay:
And to him came he rydand and can fraine,
Qu^at ailit him to ly and fairly grain
The man answered I have sik sturt,
For both with theif and reuer I am hurt
And it suppois I have all the pyne,
The falt is owris sir King and nathing mine.
For and with ow good counsal war ay chief
Than wald e stanche weill both reuer and theif,
Have thou with the that can weil dance and ^^ng
Thou taks nocht thocht yi realm weip and wri^g
With that the King the bob of birks can wave,
The fleis away out of his woundis to have:
And than began the woundit man to grane,
Do nocht sa sir allace I am slane.
How sayis thou, thou tell me quod the King,
Quhy thou sayis sa I ferly of this thing:
And sa said al his men that stude about,
Thou wald be haill and they war chasit out
The sair can say be him that can us save
Your fule sir King hes mair wit than e have.
And weil I ken be his phis^omie,
He hes mair wit nor al our cumpanie.
My tung is sweir my body hes na strenth,
Frane at our fule he can tell ow at lenth:
I am but deid and I may speik na mair,
Adieu sir, for I have said weil mot e fair.
Fra this sair man now cummin is the King,
Hauand in mind greit murmr and moving:
And in his heart greit hauines and thocht,
Sa wantonly in vane al thing he wrocht.
And how the Cuntrie throw him was misfarne,
Throw ong counsel and wrocht ay as abarne.
And it as he was droupand thus in dule,
Of all and al he fer let of his fule.
Quhat kind of man this fuil with him sold be,
And quhat this sair man be this fuil micht se.
And quhat it is the cause quhairfoir and quhy,
He was wyser than all his cumpany.
Quhan cummin was the king to that City,
Full fast than for his fule frainit he.
And quhan the king was set down to his meit
Unto his fuill gart make ane semely seit:
Ane Rowndell with ane cleine claith had he,
Neir quhair the king micht him both heir and se^
Than quod the king a lytill wie and leuch,
Sir fuill e ar lordly set aneuch:
Quhan e ar full quhat call they ow and how,
Sa hamely as e ar with me now.
Sir to my Name they call me fule Fictus,
Befoir ow as e may se me sit thus:
And of this Cuntrie certes am I borne,
With luck and grace and Fortoun me beforne:
Schir fuill tell me gif that e saw this day,
Ane woundit manly granand by the way.
Ze sir forsooth sik ane man couth I sie,
And in his wound was money felloun fly:
Now quod the king sir fuill to me e say.
Quhy skarrit e not they flies all away:
Thocht e it was ane deid of charity,
In seik man's wound for to leif ane fly,
Sir trow me weill full suith it is I say,
Better was still they fleis than skarrit away.
For gif sa be the fleis away e skar,
Than after them cums hungriar be far.
Thairfoir war better let them be but dout,
For the full fleis hal^s the hungry out.
The hungry fly that never had been tahir,
Scho souks the man's wound sa wonder sair:
And quhen the fleis ar full than bide they still,
And stops the hungry beis to cum thairtil.
Bot sir allace me think sa do not e,
Ze ar sa licht and full of vanity,
And sa weil ^ufis al new things to persew,
That ilk sessioun e get ane servant new.
Quhat will the ane now say unto the other,
Now steir thy hand mine awin deir brother:
Win fast be time and be nocht lidder,
For wit thou weil Hal binks ar ay slidder.
Thairfoir now quhither wrang it be or richt,
Now gadder fast quhil we have time and micht.
Se na man now to the King e^rand speik,
Bot gif we get ane bud or ellis we sal it breik.
And quhan they ar full of sic wrang win,
They get their leif and hungryar cums in:
Sa sharp ar they and narrowly can gadder,
They pluck the puir as they war powand Hadder.
And taks buds fra men both neir and far,
And ay the last ar than the first far war:
Justice, Crounar sariand and justice clark,
Remoues the auld and new men ay they mark.
Thus fla they all the puir men belly flaucht,
And fra the puir taks many felloun fraucht:
And steirs them and wait the tide will gang,
Syne after that far hungrier cums than.
And thusgait ay the puir folk ar at under,
This World to sink for sin quhat is it wonder?
Thairfoir now be this exampil we may se,
That ane new servant is like ane hungry fle.
Than quod the King quhat say e to ou^ fule,
Suppois that he had been ane Clath at scule.
To God now quod the King I make ane ^ow,
Ze are not sik ane fule as e let ow:
Thus wonderit all the King that sat about,
And of this fule had f^rly dreid and dout.
Thoche he was fule in Habit in all feiris,
Ane wyser sperk they hard never with their (...).
Thus ferlyit al their was both he and he,
Quhat manner of ane thing micht this be.
And like to ane was nocht into Rome,
Zit than his word was full of al wisdom.
For he as fule began guckit and gond,
And ay the wyser man ne^rar the end:
And thus the ^ing and al his cumpany,
Upon this fuil had wonder and ferly.
Of the slaying of the man.
SYNE after this ane Gentelman percace,
Had slane ane man al throw his raklesnes:
And to the Court he come and tald this thing,
Unto ane man was inward with the King.
And said sir lo, I am in the Kings grace,
That hes ane man slane in my fault a ^lace.
And will e gar the King to that consent,
For it I sal ow pay and concent.
This Coueteour held on this to the king,
And tald him all this tail to the ending.
And than the king for his lufe and instance,
Bad bring the man that happened that mischance
Unto the king his tail quhen he had tald,
Full sharply to this man he could behald,
Ane semely man of make sa semit he,
To s^ay that man he thocht ane greit pity:
And bad him pass quhair he lykit to ga,
And be good man and after slay na ma.
Sone after that within half a eir,
Ane other man he slew withouttin weir.
Of the second slain man.
THAN to the Court he cummin is agane,
Unto this man befoir his gold had taken:
And said sir I have s^aue allace,
Ane other man throw misfortune and case:
And wald e help me befoir as e have done,
Ane sowme of silver e sold have full sone.
Another sowme I sall give to the king,
Me hartlie to forgive into this thing.
Help me now for Gods awin deid,
Nane other buit at ow bot I get remeid.
This Courteour him answered thus agane,
This deid to do I am vncertane.
Quhen that thou slew bot ane throw racklesnes,
Of that thou micht have gotten forgiveness,
Sa may it nocht quhen thou hes slane thus two,
Notwithstanding I will for the ga.
The for to help I sal get sik assay,
And for the do alsmekil as I may.
Unto the king than come this Courteour,
And lukit weil both to his time and hour.
He lukit quhan the King was blyth and glad,
And nocht quhen he was heavy nor sad*
Full lawlie sat h^ down upon his kne,
Lo sir he said, ane thing of greit pity:
The man that e forgave syne half ane eir,
Another man now hes he slane but weir.
Ane certane sowme of gold thus sal e get,
And e wald all our crabitnes foret.
He wepes and he sichs now sa sair,
That he sik miss will after do na mair.
In all our Realm their is na wichter man,
Greit pity is it for t^ tyne him than.
Ze may him have and of his gold and geir.
He will stand ow in steid in time of weir,
Suppois he hes slane two better it is that e,
Have two men slane than thus for to sla thrie.
Thairfoir heir I beseik ow in this case,
That e wald tak him in our gudelie grace.
The King bad than bring him to his presence,
And him forgave all fault and offense.
And bad him ga and do sik miss na mair,
Thus tuke this man his leif and hame can fair.
Syne efterward this man that we off reid,
The third man hes he slane ic in deid.
Of the thride slain man.
THAN to the Court agane maid his repair,
Sik grace to get agane as he did air:
Sa come he to the Courteour to tell,
His fortoun and his case how it befell.
This courteour to speik wald not spair,
For ow forsooth sir dar I speik na mair.
Sa often and often e have done sik mischief,
I dar not speikit to king for grief,
Now be my saul and sa not I do weill,
Is na remeid als far as I can feill.
Or quhither that e sal live the Land allace,
Or put ow it into the Kings grace.
This Courteour agane unto the King,
Now cummin is and tald hail this thing:
And how the man befoir the two had slane,
The third man thus hes he slane agane.
With that the King quhen that he hard the taill,
In grit grief than wox he wan and pail.
And sweith he said bring him now heir to me,
Sal neither gold nor good let him to die.
Get he my pity than God put me out of mind,
And he wald gif me all the Golden Inde:
Syne gait he bring to him the samyn man,
Set dotin to Judge to Heid or to Hang.
This man that was sa cumbred of this case,
On kneis fell and askit the Kings grace^
The King plainly all grace can him deny,
And tald to him the cause and ressoun quhy.
With that upon ane lytil bony stule,
Sat Fictus that was the Kings fule.
And said now and e gar not Heid or Hang,
This man for them that he slew it war wrang.
The first man weil I grant he slew,
The other two in faith them slew ow.
Had tho^ him puneist quhan he slew the first,
The other two had been leuand I wist.
Thairfoir allace this tail sir is over true,
For in good faith the last two men e slew.
Blessit ar they that keips Judgment and Justice, etc.
THE Psalms sayis David wa^ and wise,
Blist mot they be that keips Law and Justice.
Thairfoir I wald that e sold not presume,
Na to have count upon the day of Dome.
For man's body their to give ane eild,
Quhome to e sold be sickar Speir and shield*
Of all the Realm quhom off e beir the Cronn,
Of lawit and leirit, rich pure, up and down.
The quhilk and they be slane with man's hand,
Ane count thairof e sall gif I warrant.
Less than it be throw sum grit negligence,
Quhairin his mercy or in his defense:
And on the day of Dome be Sance Paull,
The Bishops mon ay answer for the Saull.
Gif it be lost for fault of Priest or preiching,
Of the richt treuth it haif na chesing.
In sa far as the Saull is for thy,
Far worthier is than the blait body:
Many Bishops in ilk Realm we se,
And bot ane King into ane Realm to be.
Thus hes the Saull mair wark and cure,
Than the body that is of na valor.
Be this was said the King sayis wa is me,
For I am fule of fules weill I see,
I se weill I have lytil part of scule,
That thus sold be informit with ane fule.
I se weil be this taill this fule can tell,
That I had greitly neid of wise counsel.
To send for all my Lords I consent,
I desire this to be in Parliament.
And it be true my fule hes said me heir,
I sal weil rewaird him withouttin weir:
And be it falls and full of fantasy,
Ane fule he is and fule him hald sal I.
And throw this fule this manslayer did get,
Unto the Parliament perfyte respet:
And after quhan their Lords al can cum,
Unto this Parliament both al and sum:
Be all the thrie Estaits it was found,
Considderand all the matter crop and ground,
This Fictus that was callit the fule,
Was wise in word th^cht he was Clark inscule,
The King bad all the thrie Estaits that they,
Sold sit down al and sie a ganand way:
Quhat man in house war meit with him to dwell,
Of wisdom for to gif him counsel:
And for to make be his Estaits thrie,
Into this Realm concordant unity.
And quhen that all this deid was dewlie done,
The King sweit be his Sceptour and his Croun*
That he sold never gif mercy to nane,
That slauchter in his Realm committit than.
Aganis his will bot throw his negligence,
Or ellis that it be fund in his defense.
And lik ane rew^l maid he into his Land,
That luck and grace in it was ay growand.
And than this nobill King all lichtnes left,
All bot ane thing that was not fra him reft:
The quhilk for ill toungs lang had been,
Ane stit strangnes betwixt him and his Queen.
He beddit nocht richt often nor lay her by,
Bot throw lichtnes did lig in Lamenry.
SA happenit throw case into the Town,
Unto ane Burges Iuins he maid him boun,
Ane lytill wie befoir the feist of Zule,
In cumpanie bot five sum and his fule,
This Burges had ane dochter to him deir,
Ane bonie wenche sho was withouttin weir.
The King on her he casts his lusty Eine,
And with hit feign wald in ane bed haif been:
He wist full weill that nane had he,
That was sa subtle as Fictus was and flee.
He callit him and privily can say,
Sik fantesie hes put me in effray:
I am sa full of lust and fantesy,
With this Modyn on benk that sits me by*
For gold, for good, for wage or it for wed,
This nicht I wald have her to my bed.
Than quod the fuill I understand ow weill,
I tak on hand to do it every deill.
Sit still now sir will e let me allane,
Be me this eirand sall be vndertaue.
Sone after quhan they war at sport and play,
The fule came to this bonie pre^tie may,
And said Madyn wist e of the degrie,
How pleasant it is to God virginity:
Tak exampill S. Margaret and Katrine,
And mo^e other Sa^ts that are sine:
In Heuins bless that hes sik joy and grie*
With Croun on heid for their Virginity.
I wait for all the gold into this town,
Of Madynheid e wald not tyne the Croun.
Bot ay the king wont he had besie been,
Of the matter that was their two between,
And to the Virgin ong thus spak the king,
Quhat my fule sayis I trow be na lesing:
Sir quod sho his saw was suffisand,
And as he sayis I sall do God willand.
Be that the kings Stewart cummin is,
To have the king to his supper I wis.
The king said to his fule in priuetie,
Of the eirand Fictus how sal it be.
Now hard e not hirself consent thairto,
That as I said to ow sho hecht to do.
Bot ane thing have I hecht sickerly,
That nane sal cum about her sir bot I:
The Virgin is bot ong and thinks shame,
And is full laith to cum in ane ill name:
And quhan the kings supper was at end,
Fictus the fule unto the Queen can wend.
And to her said do my counsel Madame,
To ow it sall be nouther sin nor shame:
A Burges dochter to her Father deir,
This nicht the king thinks to have but weir:
And tald her all the case and manner how,
Her for to have he gart the King weil trow.
Bot that be God that with his blude us bo^ht,
With her to gar him sin was never my thocht:
The King commands to his chief Chalmerlane,
Quhan ever I cum with her I be in taken.
And in his bed sal privily in creip.
Quhil that the king sal cum their and sleip.
And privily thus be the day agane,
Away with me the Madyn sal be taken.
Thairfoir Madame for God be not aghast,
About our heid our cloak clenlie cast:
Quhairfoir sold e dout or be a dred,
Is nane bot e sold bruik the Kings bed:
The warst may fall suppose it wittin war,
Me thocht he hang ow will he never skar.
And thus is my counsel Madame e do,
In faith quod sho and I consent thairto:
All thus and thus befoir as e have hard,
The Queen is brocht unto the kings bed.
The quhilk all nicht in vthers arms lay,
Quhat man to tell of al their sport and play:
The king thocht never nicht to him sa short,
Sa lykit he that nichts play and sport.
And on the morn a lytil befoir day,
The Fule come in and tuke the Queen away.
And thus and thus after nichts thrie,
With his awin Queen grit gaming had and glie
And weil he wend that it had been but weir,
That with him lay the Burges dochter deir.
Quhome throw he had sik joy and sik plesance,
Quhilk maid him ay the Fule for to auance:
Sa was the King sa amorat of his Fule,
Beside himself ay sat upon a stule.
Was never it mair joy and plesance seen,
Than the king hes in bed with his awin Queen:
And that was na grit ferly to befall,
For sho was fair and good and ong with all.
And thus the Fule quhen he persauing had.
How that the king sa joyful was and glade:
Unto the king he came in priuitie,
And said now sir ane thing that e tell me*
Quhair foir it is the case fane wit wald I,
Qu^y that e have in ow sik fantasy:
To ly with women and of law degrie*
Aganis our Quens will and Majesty.
Considder and weil that sho is fair and good,
With ilkane other beauty to conclude.
Or quhy at her e have all this dispyte,
And quhy e find in vthers sik delight.
Or quhat plesance e had their nichts thrie,
With our awin Queen in bed than mair to be.
The King answered and said now sikarly,
I can not tell the ressoun cause nor quhy:
Ficcus my fule with the na mair to flyte,
Bot wantonly ay follows my appetyte.
And quhan that my delight is upon other,
Thau money folk will cum and with me fludder.
And sum will tell il ^ailes of the Queen,
The quhilk be her war never hard nor seen.
And that I do they say al weil is done,
Thus falls clutterars puts me out of tone.
And thus because I am licht of feirs,
And heirs evil tails and lichtly lendis my eiris,
And thus of her I have na appetyte,
And of al others ay have I grit delight.
Sir quod the fule will e not consent,
Their thrie nichts that e war weil content:
Ze that I grant be God that is of micht,
Had never nane mair plesance on the nicht.
God quod the King sen my fortoun had been,
Sen sho I had their nichts thrie war Queen.
Quhat will e gif me, than speiks the fule,
Suppose I be na cunning Clark in scule:
Within thrie days to make it well seen,
With Gods Law for to make her our Queen.
And thairto do sal na man say agane,
And do I not my heid sal be the pane.
Than quod the king thairto I hald my hand,
Thou sal have good gold, Lordships and Land.
Or cast fra the thy cote and be tho^^ wise,
Ane Bishoprik sal be thy benefyse.
Than quod the fule without feineing or fabil,
Hald up our hand to hald this firm and stabil:
The King thairto swore often and often,
And their he hes his hand haldin on loft:
And now quod the fule it fallis to na King,
To brek his vow or it his oblissing:
And it that I have hecht thus sone sal be,
Scho is our Queen e had their nichts thrie:
That quod the king be him that deid on Rude,
Sir fule I trow e may not make that good.
Sir I pray ow be not evil payit nor wraith.
After sa strait ane oblessing and aith*
And gir that she plesit ow their nichts thrie,
Fra hyneforth now quhairfoir may not sa be.
Richt now e wald have had her to our wife,
And their in now with me e make ane strife.
Quhat quod the king be him that was borne in Zule
Thou art ane auld scoller at the scule.
I farly quhair sik Soph^e thou hes fund,
That with my awin band thou hes me bund.
Notwithstanding I am hartly content,
To my awin Queen I will hartly consent:
And mair attour I sweir the be the Heuin,
I sal her never displeis for od nor euin.
With thy that she may preif that it was sho,
Their nichts thrie with quhom I had ado:
And with that word forouttin mair carping,
Unto the Queens Chalmer come the King.
And simply to her presence can persew,
And tempit her with takens good and true
And sickarly he fand that it was sho,
With quhome they nichts thrie he had ado.
Than joyful was he in his hearts spleen,
Of the plesance he had with his awin Queen:
Than on his kneis he askit forgiveness,
For his licht laytes and his wantones.
And sho forgave him meiklie this full ^yte,
That he had done throw lichtnes of dely^e:
For weil sho saw that al was fantesy.
That he vsit and richt grit folly.
And thus the King and Queen into this case,
Thankit their God for their weilfair and grace,
And syne this fule they thankit of al,
That caused sik concord amang them ^al.
And off his coat they ^irli^ be the croun,
And on him kest ane side clarkly goun:
And quhen this side goun on him micht be,
Ane cunning Clark and wise than semit he.
Syne after sone ane Bishop their was deid,
Full sone was he maid Bishop in his steid:
And to the King and Queen he was full leif,
And of their inwart counsel ay may chief.
And God sen si^ e^amples ay were seen,
To ilk ane King that luifit nocht his Queen.
God gif us grace and space an eird to spend,
Thus of my tailnow cummin is the end.
And than spak all the fallowship thus syne,
God quyte ow sir our tail and saut Martyne.
Sir Williame than sayis now fallis me*
To tell ane tail thocht I be of ow thrie:
The febillest and leist of literature,
Zit than with all my deligence and cure:
To tell ane tail now sik ane as I have,
Of me, me think e sold na other crave.
The third taill tald be Master Williame.
A King their is and ever mair will be,
Thairfoir the KING of kings him call we
Thus he had a man as he hes money,
Into this Land als rich as other any,
This man that we of speik had friends thrie,
And lufit them nocht in ane degrie.
The first friend quhil he was laid in delf,
He lufit ay far better than him self.
The nixt friend than alsweil luifit he,
As he him self luifit in all degrie.
The third friend he luifit this and swa,
In na degrie like to the the other two.
Suppois he was ane friend to him in name,
To him as friend it wald he never clame.
The the other two his freindis war indeid,
As he thocht quhen that he had any neid.
Sa fell it on ane day sone after than,
This he did send about this rich man.
And sent to him his Officer but weir,
Thus but delay befoir him to compeir.
And with him count and give reckning of all,
He had of him al time both grit and small,
With that this Officer past on good speid,
And summond this rich man be of reid:
And all the case to him he can record,
That he in haist sold cum to his awin Lord.
This rich man he he had hard this tail,
Full sad in mind he wo^ both wan and pail:
And to him self he said sichand full sair,
Allace how now this i^ ane haisty fai^:
And I cum their my taste it will be taggit,
For I am red that my count be ouir raggit.
Quhat sal I do now may I say allace*
A cumbred man I am into this case.
I have na other help nor it supply,
Bot I will pas to my friends thrie:
Two of them I luifit ay sa weil,
But any fault their freindship will I feil.
The third friend I leit lichtly of ay,
Quhat may he do to me bot say me nay.
Now will I pas to them and preif them now,
And tell them all the cause and manner how.
To the first friend.
THVS came he to his friend that he,
Lufit better than him self in all degrie:
And said lo friend my heart thou ever had,
And now allace I am full straightly stad:
To me the king his Officer hes send,
For he will that my count to him be kend:
And I am laith allane to him to ga,
Without with me ane friend be ane or two.
Thairfoir I pray ow that e tell me now to*
In this matter quhat is the best ado.
And thus answered this friend agane that he,
Over all this world lufit as A per C.
The Devil of Hell he said now mot me hing,
And I compeir befoir that crabit King.
He is sa full of justice, richt and ressoun,
I lufe him not in ocht that will me chessoun.
He lufis not na riches be the Rude,
Nor hilynes in heart, nor evil won good.
Than evil won good to gar men gif agane,
Their may be na war use now in ane:
Agane him can I get na good defense,
Sa just he is and stark in his conscience.
And al things in this world tha^ I call richt,
It is nocht worth ane ^g into his sicht.
And it that is my lyking (...) eis,
To him always will neither play nor pleis:
And that to me is both joy and gloir,
As fantasys iudgit him hefoir,
And thus he is aganis me ay and ever,
And weill I wait thairfoir he lufit me never,
He hes na lyking lufe nor lust of me.
Na I to him quhill the day I die.
Quhairto thairof sold I make any mair,
I cum nocht to the King I the declair:
Fra time that thou art under now a reist,
Of the in faith I have but little feist.
Be me I trow thou art but lytill meind,
^as on thy way and seik another friend:
Now is this man sair murnand in his mind,
Sayand allace my friend is over unkind.
Quhome I wend was support and supply,
And now allcae the contrair now I sie:
Away ^e wend sayand in wordis wild,
I grant be God that I am all begylde.
The second friend.
UNTO this the other friend cummin is this man,
That as him self befoir he lufit than:
And said lo friend the King hes send for me
His officer and biddis that I be:
At him in haist and cum sone to his call,
And to him make my count of grit and small.
That I of him in all my dayis had,
And I sie richt I am sa straightly stad:
Now as my friend I hidder come to the,
Quhome as my self I lufe in all degree.
For quhan I am in strife or it in sturt,
Into my heart me think thou sold be hurt.
Thairfoir I pray that thou wald vnderta,
With me unto on King that thou wald ga.
This friend answered and said to him agane,
I am displeisit and ill payit of thy pane:
Bot I am nocht ready in onie thing,
With the for to compeir befoir that king.
Thocht he hes send for the his Officer,
I may not ga with the quhat will thou mair,
Sa with the I bid nocht for to lane,
I am full red that I cum never aganc.
Quha sal me mend and of my bail me beit,
To tak the sower and for to leif the sweit.
Quhat I have heir daily in faith I feill,
And their quhat I sall have I wait not weil.
Thairfoir this tail is true into al tide,
Quhair ane fair is weil the langer sold he bide.
Thairfoir me thin^ that I sold be to sweir,
Befoir on king with ow for to appeir.
Bot a thing is to say in terms short,
With ow my friend I will ga to the port.
Trust weil of me na mair of mine e get,
Fra e be anis in at the kings et.
And thus shortly withow for to conclude,
Mair nor is said of me e get na good.
With that the man that thus charged his friend,
He said allace I may na langer leind.
Sen I my two best friends couth assay,
I can nocht get a friend it to my pay
That dar now tak in hand for onie thing.
With me for to compeir befoir on king.
Quhasaeuer may Vennome or Poysoun taist,
That be the hands in quhom their traist is may*
Me to begyle quha hes mair craft and gin,
Than they in quhome my traist ay may is in.
Quhat ferly now with nane thocht I be meind,
Sen thus falsely now faileis me my friend:
Now weil I se and that I vnderta,
Than feineit friend better is open fa.
Als suith it is as ships saillis over watters,
And weil I wait al is not gold that glitters.
Now is over lait to preif my friend in deid,
Quhan that I have sik mister and sik neid.
Better had been be time I had over taken,
To preif my friend quhen mister had I nane.
Allace quhat sal I say, quhat sal I do,
I have na ma friends for to cum to:
Bot ane the quhilk is callit my third friend,
With him I trow I w^l be lytil meind:
To ga to him I wait bot wind in waist,
For in him I have lytil troth or traist.
Because to him I was sa often unkind,
And as my friend he was not in my mind:
Bot helely and lichtlie of him leit,
And now to him thus mon I ga and gr^it.
How sold I murne or make my mane him to,
Befoir with him I had sa lytil ado.
Suppois to me he was ane friend in name,
Zit than as friend to him wald I never clame,
Of him I had full lytil joy or feist,
Of al my friends in faith I lufit him leist,
Quhat may he do to me bot say me nay,
Thairfoir I will ga heir quhat he will say.
Quhat ferly is I be not with him meind,
I held him nocht bot for a quarter friend.
To the third friend.
NOW cummin is the man that we of reid,
Unto this third friend quhen he had neid:
And tald him the manner and the case,
How on him laid ane Officer his mace:
And summond him and ^ad he sold compeir,
Befoir the King and gif ane count perqueir.
And to him make ane sharp count of al,
He had into his life haith grit and small.
And thus answered his friend to him agane,
Of the in faith good friend I am full fane,
Of me altyme thou gave bot lytil tail,
Na of me wald have ^ant nor dail.
And thou ^ad to me d^^e onie thing.

Of him that played, etc.
IT fortunit that in a market Town in the county of Suffolk their was a stage
play, in the quhi^k play one called Iohne Adroynes, quhisk dwelled in another
village two miles from th^nce played the devil. And quhen the play was done,
this John Adroynes in the evening departit from the said market Town, to go
hame to his awin house. And because he h^d their no change of clothing, he went
forth in his Devils apparel, quhilk in that way coming hame ward, he came
throw a warren of co^es belanging to a gentilman of the village, quhair he
himself dwelt. At quhilk time it fortuned ane Priest a Vicar of a Kirk thereby
with two or thrie unthrifty fellows, had brocht with them a horse a hey and a
Ferit, to the intent their to get conyes. And quhen the ferit was in the eirth
and the hey set over the path way quhair this John Adroines sold cum, this
priest and his other fellowis saw him him come in the Devils raiment
considdering that they were in the devils service and steiling of conies, and
supposing it had been the devil in deid, sor feir they ran all away. This Iohne
