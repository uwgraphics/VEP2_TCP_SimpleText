THE OVERTHROW OF the Gout / Written in Latin verse, by Doctor Christopher
Balista.

IMPRINTED AT London by Abraham Ueale dwelling in Paul's Church yard at ye
sign of ye Lamb. 1577.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, his very good Friend M. RICHARD MASTERS Doctor in
Physic, and Servant to her excellent Majesty.
SIR, I SEND you here a short treatise of the Gout, written by one Balista a
Frenchman, and dedicated to a great Physician in France.

It came by Fortune (being as I think not any where else to be had) into my
hands, which for the benefit of diverse my friends troubled with that disease,
and partly for mine own recreation, that was something delighted with the
writer (in as good manner as I could) I Englished. The verse in Latin is not
very eloquent, and therefore no meruail though the translation be rude and
unpleasant.

But sure his Method and order is not in mine oppinio^ to be dissalowed, but
rather much to be commended. I have noted him in such places as I thought
convenient, and would have farther augmented him but that I thought it not good
to be to curious in an other man's woork.

Such as it is: I send it you and commit it to your good allowance and
protection.

Your very loouing friend. B. G.

The Overthrow of the GOVTE.
AGainst the Gout with al her force
my mind desires to go:
And with a valiant hand to fling,
my darts at this my foe.
Long time this beast has now presumed,
her wicked force to bend:
Against that good old man that does,
the Sedun flock defend,
Diseased sore he lies and able,
not to stir a limme:
So has the wretch benomd his Joints
and so has plagued him.
That still he is inforste to keep his house,
as does the Snaill:
O pitious hap and great mischaunce,
that each man ought to waill.
It greeues me to the heart to se,
the torments that he bears:
Her cruelty Constrayneth me,
to stain my cheeks with tears
My sorrows does command ye doutfull hap
of Mars to try:
Why stand I still? I will assail,
the monster presentlye.
Draw near O sweet Redeemer of,
the World before undone:
Of that most glorious majesty,
the true and only son.
Uouchsafe to give thy speeding darts,
in this my quarrel just:
And cause that I with them may throw
this monster in the dust.
And thou O noble Phillip, by all
the Gods abooue that be:
I thee require to show thy self,
a man in each degree.
Hope well for hope avails much,
In driving greef away:
I dout no whit, but shortly thou
shall see a fairer day.
More hapeneth in an hour sometime,
then in a thousand year:
And many great commodities,
in smallest time appeer.
I trust to drive the Gout unto
the loathsome pit of hell:
And that thou shall good Phillip have
thy feet again full well.
Do you no more but bear in mind,
the words that I shall say:
And these my lessons that I give,
do carry well away.
The subtle shackles that this Beast,
does bind the feet withal:
Podagran all the learnd of Greece,
have ever used to call.
Hence sprang at first the hateful name,
of this so painful greef:
That suddenly the feet unwares,
assaileth like a thief.
At first it rages in the joints,
and then assaults the toes:
And straight from thence with hasty course
unto the heel it goes.
And sometimes to the buckle bones,
where as it swelles and shows:
With pain while as abundance great,
of humors thither flows.
Sometime the Cod beside, that both
the stones incloseth round:
Does swel withal and hanging low,
it oftentimes is found.
The causer of this great disease,
not evermore is one:
Often times the parents are the cause
it falls the Child upon.
When as the seed but feeble is,
whereof the fruit is wrought:
For since the root such weakness has,
the plant must needs he naught.
Besides to vehement exercise,
the Gout does often breed:
Of service long in Venus court,
it likewise does proceed.
The very frame of all the limbs,
is shaken with this game:
Each Sinow eke enfeebled is
by using of the same.
And Bacchus thou that wunted art,
the spirits to revive:
Do use to hurt the feet of such,
as in thy service strive.
Of Martial acts in stately style,
did Ennius always write:
And in his cups did blase the deeds,
of many a worthy knight.
Yet of the Gout at last he dyed,
nor could his verses save:
(With all the sweetness that they had)
their master from the grave.
Great hurt beside unto the joints,
does evermore arise:
Of cold, excessive Idleness,
and to much exercise.
The heart with fury once inflamde,
does kindle presently:
And fireth all the humors straight,
that in the body lie.
Whereby unbridled all, they rome
and raunge in every place:
And paining all the Senous sore,
they vex in pitious case.
Often times of thick and clammy fleume,
this vile disease does breed:
Sometime again, of both the sorts
of Choler does proceed.
And tomuch blood while as it does,
the tender joints oppress:
Is many times the only cause,
of this unquietness.
Most grieved with this disease are men.
the women not so much:
The cause is plain and evident,
who lists it to touch.
One reason is because that heat,
in man does more exceed:
Which causes that the humors pearse,
the senowes more with speed.
Most subject to the gout are those,
that greatest age have seen:
And such as with some sickness great,
have long tormented been.
And cares of mind and sorrows great,
do breed this grievous sore:
And want of wunted exercise,
as has been said before.
Let this suffice to show the spring,
of such a ^^^lish sprite:
Now time it is my weapons for,
to show and fall to fight.
And first I will begin with herb,
with Juice and metals bright:
And then of stones that serve the turn,
I crave the aid and might.
Then Beasts and Birds I set in rank,
and cause them to restore:
The weak and wearish limbs of those
that lamed were before.
And last of all my Tables do
I spread with meat and Wine:
And there the perfect diat for
this sickness do assign.
First Toutsane unto thee I give, Not our common Toutsane but Dioscorides his
Panacaea reed Mathiolus.

the cheifest place before:
That do derive thy worthy name,
of bealing every sore.
Thou beaten small and mingled well
with reasons good and sweet:
In plaster made applied well,
do heal the feeble feet.
An herb there is that in the Sun, Mary Goldes.

does woundrously delight:
And after him does evermore,
direct her course aright.
That when be once begins to rise,
does spread and open wide:
And mourning hangs down her head,
when Westwards he does slide.
This meddled well with sewet of
a Got, does drive away.
The Gout, the like does Balm stamped
if to the feet you lay.
And Ueruen sod in water does
the feet from sickness save:
Which herb the noble Romans wont
in great account to have.
The alter fair of Jupiter,
with this they used to sweep:
And therewith every corner of
their houses sprinkled deep.
Beside the Herald when he gave,
defiance to his foe:
Commanded was with Garland all
of Ueruen clad to go.
Coleworts in this disease are good,
being sodden specially:
The broth whereof refuse not thou,
to drink for remedy.
Put Coliander to the Cole,
and Salt and Rewe beside:
And flower fine of Barley that,
by grinding small is tried,
A Pultise made of these, if to
the aching joints ye lay:
It greatly does the pains assuage,
and drives the Gout away.
And if the Gout be such as in
his rage it does not swel:
The Radish root will help, if that
in Wine you sees it well.
The noble Radish that our fathers
old, did greatly love:
And did indeed the same esteem,
all other meats abooue.
At Delphus was it then decreed,
it should be grau'd in Gold:
The Beet in silver to be framde,
the Raape in leaden moulde.
This to the Gout is to be laid,
the Juce of Woodbinde thick:
And mingle there withal the meal
or Flower of Fenugrick.
And Nettel roots well bruised in
the strongest Uinager:
The leaves beside being pouned with The leaf and the seed with Beres Grease.

the tallowe of a Bear.
And stinking Assa faetida,
in spunges well applyde:
Will like wise help the grievous Gout,
and Fever sore beside.
If thereunto you put the War,
that is from Cipresse brought:
And see that with the suet of
a Got it well be wrought.
Plantain being pouned well with salt,
and Lens with Pap made with Barley
Polent good:
The water Betany, besides
Hemp roots, and Sothernwood.
The Juice of Henbane mixed with meal,
that from the Mil does fly:
And war, with Gum Armoniack
in equal quantity.
And boiled well in Uinagre.
the branch of Poplar small:
With Herb that bears his name of Age,
that Grounsil we do call.
To this it needful is to put,
the grease of fatted Bore:
And mingle wax with Willowe leaves,
that well have sod before.
An Herb there is that in the Sea, Phicus marina Sea weed.

does always wind about:
Which (if it be not over dry)
will heal the painful Gout.
Who would believe that heaps of Corn,
should drive the Gout away,
And bring the feeble foot his force,
to stand without a stay?
As Sextus searching of the Barnes, Sextus Pompeius

was taken with the Gout:
He laid him down in heaps of Wheat,
that closde him rownd about.
When suddenly he felt him self,
as well as any man:
And rising up with joyful heart,
to walk about began.
For all the humor out was drawn,
and dried by this releef:
That was the head, the fountain and
the cauie of all this greef.
For such a force is in the Wheat,
as that it has been seen:
The vessels full in shortest time
to draw and dry up clens
To Elder leaves. the Sewet of
a Got put orderly:
This laid unto the feet will be
a present remedy.
Forget not that same herb beside
that green does always grow: Houseleek or Singre.

It heals those same angry Goutss,
that red and fiery show.
The Gourd that grows wild his rine,
is thought to do the same:
Which also helps the head that does
with fiery humors flame.
The like being sod in Uinagre The wild Cocumber.

the Cocumber will do:
So will the Cole, the surging Seas
that grows near unto. Sea Colwort it grows under the Clyfts besides
Seaforde in Sussex

And Purslain pounded well with Salt,
does heal this painful rage:
And likewise does the fiery heat
of shingles soon assawge.
It Is very strange that rust of Iron,
will heal the grievous Gout:
The wound beside with Lancel made,
will let the poison out.
When Telephus with staf of fierce
Achilles wounded was:
And never a Surgion there about:
could bring the cure to pass.
They took aduisement of their Gods,
Apollo answered thus:
Achilles Sword (quoth he) shall save,
the life of Telaphus.
With joyful mind went Telephus,
to meet his enemy:
Who striking gave him with his wound,
a present remedy.
The treacle good beside, that cures
the deadly poison strong:
Is souerain to be used against
the Gout retained long.
What should I here of Salt entreat
Nature that all things spun:
Created nothing needful more
for man then Salt and sun.
With salt we savor all our meat,
and do preserve our food:
Take Salt away our bankets loss,
no Uiands seems good.
Salt makes strong and lusty Joints,
example good may be: A Bag of Salt beaten small wet in boiling wine and laid to
the feet. Or salt very fine beaten with Oil of Camomil made in an Ointment.

The tough and sturdy limbs of horn,
in Fishers that we see.
Salt with his fretting force, does enter,
pearce and through spring:
Dissolueth, eats, burns up
and fineth every thing.
With Honey, Oil, and meal being mixed
and beaten as it ought:
It makes good the feet again,
that feeble were and naught.
And if you list my poor advise,
in this disease to take:
Go get you to the Sea and bathe,
your feet when they do ache.
It Is good in Brimstone bathes sometime
to wash your self beside:
Which will refresh your crased limbs,
and stop a stormy tide.
Take water with Salt Peeter mixed
and Brimstone, let them boil:
And wash your legs, or if you list,
with Lees of sodden Oil.
And now for stones, let three suffice,
the Jet as one of those:
From whence a stinking sulphur asre,
ascends to the nose.
The smell whereof do Serpents shun,
wherewith what soever you write:
In brittel vessel made of Earth,
will never out of sight.
Lay this unto your Gout, the stone
that Iron up does take:
Does tame this mad unruly beast,
and quickly out does shake.
Beat small a Medstone, mix it with
the Milk of such a wight:
As at her first delivery brings
a pretty Boy to light.
This will assuage the Gout, if that
you lay it thereunto:
And bring the Senowes to their force,
to do as they should do.
You worthy creatures that have life,
with haste your selves address,
And let me have your helping hands,
in this my business.
The bones of man to ashes burnt,
and made in powder sine:
Being drunk, is not of littie force,
against this foe of mine.
And woman's milk, if that you join
the Humlock therwithall:
Applied to the feet does heal,
the raging torments all.
Put Goosegrece heerunto and ad
green Isop to the same:
Or Opium wherwithall you may,
a parfect medicine frame. Opium the Juice or Gum of black Poppey.

With greece of swine, join woman's hear
and this shall do you good:
Being laid unto the aching feet,
that rage with angry mood.
Refuse not thou to bath thy feet,
with Urin of a man:
Provided that the party be,
as helthy as ye can.
The right foot of an Egle, to
your right foot look you lay:
And to your left leg lay the left,
to drive the gout away.
Sometime again with Horseleaches,
beset your feet about:
That Blood suckers are termed of
the rude and common rout.
These never will forsake the legs,
whereto they cleave and pull:
(So great desire they have to blood)
til all their skin be full.
But all the vilest humors that,
they in those parts do find:
Which were the causers of this greef,
they drink with greedy mind.
And when they once have fiid them selves,
as full as they may be:
They leave the place and fall away,
as beasts that drunken be.
But if they chance to cleue to fast,
and will not leave their hold,
Then sprinkle beaten Salt thereon
burnt wul or ashes cold.
It holsom is beside to open in
thy feet some bleeding vain:
Whereby the humor passes out,
that breeds all thy pain.
An aged Cock well stewed in broth,
being drunk does pleasure great:
In filling all the ioints and limbs
with sweet and pleasant heat.
The milk of Asses drunck does heal,
the gout with raging mood:
So does the flesh thereof if that,
you vss it for your food.
The Owl that has a body fat,
you sees in water stall:
And often eat the tender flesh
and drink the broth withal.
The Greece of Swine, with Ashes mixed
of dung that Gates do make:
Is very souerain, if therewith Gotes du^g mingled with Barley flower and
Uinagre, a good Pultis. So is the root of marsh malowes mingled with Ducks
grease, for old swelling goutes

you noynt the feet that ache.
O worthy Grease of Swine that do,
deserve so great a praise:
What good unto the joints of man,
thou bring sundry ways.
When as the limbs and members all,
with cold congealed be:
Their natural heat again, and warmth
they straight receive from thee.
Thou supplest stifned parts and such
as weak and feebled be:
Restorste to health and sores do heal
that loathsome are to see.
Thou driu'st the Gout from hand and foot,
what should I utter more?
In few words will I speak at once,
thou healest enery sore.
Such force to thee the helthful roots,
of noble herbs do give:
Wherewith the wandering herds of Swine
in pleasant pastures live.
The Romans, that by valor all
the world did once subdue:
Had thee in honor great for this,
thy virtues that they knew.
With thee the gladsome Bride, when as
the house she enter should
Of her new married mate, the posts
and thresholdes cover would.
Here of the wife first took her name,
because in times before:
The charge to her committed was
of noynting of the door.
For they supposde this Grease would put
all troubles unto night:
And that for ever after, no
misfortune enter might.
But to my Gout again, The Dung
of Kites and ashes fine:
Of Snailes and Wesel burned both
will heal this Gout of thine.
Let Legs that thus diseased be,
be bathed with Wesels blood:
The Sewet like wise of a Calf,
for this is very good:
To this may also added be,
the flesh of fearful Deer:
And there withal the Broth wherein, A For fleaed cut in small Gobbits
destilled with Oil of Camomil, Oil of Rue, oil of worms, of each (...).
ounces, a quantity of Aqua vite. A good water to anoint the joints.

the Hare has boiled clear.
With case of crafty Fox let all
thy foot well wrapped be:
And for to anoint them with the Grease,
of Reynard helps thee.
And good it is in skins of D^gs,
to keep and wrap them well:
And with the grease of them to anoint,
the painful feet that swel.
Moreover take a Crow and quick
put him in Horsedung deep:
And close him so that he may have,
no place away to creep.
When four days once be full expirde,
go take him from his grave:
And burn him straight, then mingle Wax
with the Ashes that you have.
This laid unto the feet, does drive
this monster quite away:
And makes the poor diseased man,
to go without a stay.
And Iunoes bird, the Peocock helps
if that his dung you take:
And plaster wise apply it to,
the lamed limbs that ache.
Anoint thy feet with drippings hot
of greasy roasted Cat:
And take the Beauers stones beside,
and mingle well with that.
To Ashes burn the Mullets head,
that in the sea does swim:
With pleasant Honye mingle it,
and anoint thy crased lim.
Go take the crauking Frog, and with
thy knife, go quarter out
His members all, and lay his feet
unto the painful Gout.
So that the right do touch the right
and that the left do lie:
Upon the left, so shall thou find
a present remedy.
But leaving now these creatures here,
though many more there be:
Of like effect, for who can write
of all in each degree?
I will thee straight ways show how thou,
thy table shall prepare:
And in what sort for thine auail,
thou shall appoint thy fare.
Great Gluttony and surfeiting,
the limbs does quickly lanie:
And therefore would I soberly,
thy diet thou should frame.
First see thy bread be baked well,
that thou at Table have:
And neither black nor yet to white,
but pleasant in the taste.
All trifles banish from thy board,
and meal with honye made:
As Custards, Pyes and Florentines,
and other of this trade.
All Salt and slimy meats, and flesh
that long does poudred lie:
And fish in Salt preserude, all such
I warn thee for to fly.
Both Garlic, Rue and Onions sour
expel them far from thee:
Although the fond Egiptians do:
suppose them Gods to be.
Abstain from Pepper, Raapes and Grapes
that in the spring time be:
From Apples, Pears, and such like fruit
as winter gives thee.
Nor suffer thou the deadly Beans
to come upon thy board:
Which once the wise Pithagoras
condemned by his word.
With this the holy Preests durst never
deal in all their rites:
It longs unto Goblins and
to black and fearful sprights.
It does the sense and wit of man,
both dull and dampish make:
And rayseth in the night such dreams,
as makes the heart to quake.
Both Peason, Nuts and Chestnuts gross
despise thou in this case:
And take thou heed that at thy board,
no Cheese have any place.
Let these suffice for food, the Hen
and Chanticlere the bold:
The Wether and the lusty Steer,
who never yet was cold.
The Cunny, Hare, the Partridge, and
the Egg that's roasted rere:
And all the smallest Birds beside
that tender limbs do bear.
Such Fishes small I like, as in
the running Rivers fleet:
And such as have no scales, for to
refuse I think it meet.
The Lamperns shun, that licking of
the rock was wunt to lie:
And therwithall the Crab that sidling
seeks her self to wry.
Let not the Eele thy Table touch,
a clamy humor still:
Does from this fish proceed, that all
the ioints of man does fill.
The Lamprey long agone was had,
in estimation great:
And taken for his dainty taste,
to be a Princes meat.
Antonia (Drusus wife) was wunt,
the Lamprey for to feed:
And set her out with rings of gold,
the farther to exceed:
A Lampry dead Hortensius did
bewail with many a tear:
Such was the favor of the great
goodwil that he did bear.
But meddle not with it whosoever
thou art that have the gout:
For why, it does increase thy pains,
and brings thy greef about.
In few words for to make an end,
For who can all things touch:
In this disease much helthsomer
is flesh, then fish by much.
Take for your drink the mildest wine,
and cleerest you can get:
And mingle it with water well,
the fume away to fet.
What quantity you ought to drink,
I need not here define:
Your own discretion heerin best,
a measure may assign.
But this I only warn you of,
that when you leave your meat:
You leave with some desire to drink,
and some desire to eat.
Then feed on Coliander seeds,
when thus you well have fed:
To make a merry heart and keep
the vapors from the head.
Give not thy self to too much sleep,
nor watch not all the night:
And let some distance be betwixt,
thy sleep and supper light.
Lie not upon the back for this
is for the body naught:
But very seldom use to ride,
take never any thought.
Sometime it shall be good awhile,
to pass the time away:
To hear the pleasant instrument,
of such as well can play.
Nothing then Music, more our greef
and sorrows banish can:
It glads the mind, and merry mind
does make a helthy man.
Far from thee look thou ever have*
all grim and sollemne Syers.
All louring lumpish looks that loathe,
bequeath them to the Friars.
Make choice of such companions, as
be wise and sweet withal:
Whose talk delightful is to hear,
and void of any gall.
Whose gravity is poudred with,
an honest pleasant mind:
Not tedious to the hearer, nor
vain waster of his wind.
Take such into thy company,
eschew the fleering mate:
The flatterer, and such as where
they come do so we debate.
Use alwaes wholesome exercise,
thy feet to walk assay:
This exercise consumes and wastes
the humors il away.
For long and slothful Idleness,
decays the members all:
And does disgrace the body quite,
And causes it to fall.
And like as Iron rusteth straight,
with loathsome Canker vile:
If that you suffer it to rest
and use it not a while.
So are our bodies straight defilde,
and unto mischeef fall:
If that we let them idle be,
and woork them not at all.
Beside a pitious sight it is,
a lamentabie case:
In see the King of Creatures all
lie lame and not have grace.
Nor will to exercise him self,
but Idle still to be:
And through his own great fault and blame,
to want his liberty.
By little and little try thy strength,
with certain rule and rate:
Which force with labor will increase,
so it be moderate.
Avoid the air that flameth still,
with ouerscorching heat:
And that which ouercolde the members all
does il entreat.
If these my rules you do observe
I trust you soon shall see:
This cruel raging Gout, as she
deserves destroyed to be.
Enough now have we tried the feelde,
the Trumpet bids retire:
Here stands the bownds of mine exployt
and end of my desire.
Soli Deo honor et Gloria.
FINIS.
A Dialogue betwixt the Gout and Cri. Balista.
Gout. ALas poor wretch alas, which way
now shall I turn my sight:
whil as so great a storm of darts
do full upon me light?
O hapless wretch whom lews aspects,
of hateful stars have torn:
Accursed be the loathsome day:
that ever I was borne.
All pearst with darts I am and know
not how my self to save:
My joints are all benumbed so,
and never a foot I have:
What favor more has nature showed,
to beasts then unto me:
That has ordained them a mean
to keep their liberty?
Often times the Stag does laugh to scorn
the Hunter and his Hound:
The Bore does laugh and every beast,
that in the woods are found.
And why? for trusting to their feet
they escape the dangers all:
Good feet does many times prevent,
great mischeefs that would fall.
But I alas more slowly move,
then any Tortoise great:
And lame and feeble as Ilye,
the darts upon me beat.
What now remains? but that to hell
pale death me down does cast:
And make an end of this my life,
that may no longer last.
Alas and shall I dye?

B. Thou shall.

G. Who^e do I hear?

B. Me.

G. Whom?

B. Thy greatest fo.

G. What is thy name?
what Region camst thou from?

B. My name Balista is.

G. Why do
thou shoot thy shaftes at me?

B. To make thee dye.

G. I not deserve
so great extremity.

B. A thousand Gallowses thou do,
a thousand Fires with all:
A thusand racks, a thousand wheels,
and after death does fall.
A thousand Helles thon do deserve,
I have not long to tell:
The sundry sorts of torments that
thou have deserved well.

G. Tell me the cause.

B. The cause is this
that men of worthy fame:
Thou with thy mischeeuous disease,
have plagued and stricken lame.

G. Who^ have I plagued?

B. Who^e? it were
to much for me to tell:
Alas I am not able for
to stay from weeping well.
Besides a number that thou wretched
beast, bast lamed quite:
While in tormenting of their joints,
thou shewds thy cruel spite.
The good Sedunian Bishop thou
haste caused down to fall:
And overcome, do keep him yet
in prison, as thy thrall.
Whose worthy life does glister like,
the Sun with blasing beams:
Him have thou in thy shackles shut,
and tied up in thy teames.
And therefore dye you shall.

G. For pity yet
show favor unto me:

B. That can I not.

G. Thou art no steel,

B. I will be unto thee.

G. O spare me yet I thee beseech,
thy Philip shall be free:
And well shall have his health again,
and walk at liberty.

B. I more deman^d.

G. What Is that?

B. That thou
foul beast, do never tuch:
The limbs of any virtuous man,
nor trouble any such.

G. To this I grant.

B. I warn thee look,
thou keep thy promise well:
Thy members else asunder will,
I tear and send to hell.

G. Whom will thou license me, with
shackels sharp to take and bind?

B. For that these words that I shall say
to thee lay up in mind.
First set thy shackels upon such,
as always fight and brall:
And murder on an other still,
for every trifle small.
Whose feet are ever forward, for
to rome unto the sword:
Contrary to the sweet decree,
of Christ our saviors word.

G. But may I be so bold to touch,
the feet of mighty Kings?

B. Yea hardly for thence the roof,
of all this mischeef springs.
what Region can you find where Mars,
his Banner has not spread?
What Cuntrie now that is not with
the blood of Christians red?
For what so ever the ambitious minds,
of Princes forth does bring:
Lis we poor souls that feel the smart,
it is we that only wring.
Go fetter thou their feet with bolts,
that never will away:
Except they cease their madness soon,
and from their follyes stay.

G. And whom besides shall I attempt?

B. The burston bellyed lout:
To him that scarce for fat can bear,
his loathsome guts about.

G. I never meddle with the paunch,

B. The paunches such I call:
As feed them selves until they be,
as fat as Ox in stall.
And nether feed with word nor life,
the sheep they ought to serve:
But slothful beasts do leave their flock
for hunger like to sterue.

G. And shall I touch no more but these?

B. Yes, such as use to swear:
Whorehunters, thieves and surfetters,
their joints in sunder tear.
And for avoiding many words,
I thus conclude with thee:
For bear the virtuous and the good,
plague those that wicked be.

FINIS.
