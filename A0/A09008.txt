The precepts teaching a prince or a noble estate his duty / written by
Agapetus in Greek to the emperor Justinian / and after translated into Latin /
and now in to English by Thomas Paynell.

To the right excellent and noble baron / my lord Montioy / lord Chamberlayne
to the queen's grace Thomas Paynel gretyng.
But that I hitherto have marked excellent baron / both by philosophers /
laweers / orators / poetis / and divines / accustomably to have been used / that
when so ever any of them did either make work / or translate any excellent
man's work: are wont for ye defense thereof / exquisitely to chose some one well
learned or noble parsone / to whom they should vow and dedicate their labor:
I at this time musyng to whom I should ascryue this my rude translation /
should not before many other have chosen your excellence. Than if I use an
honest / old / and approbate custom / who will blame me? If I chose an
excellent learned man (I mean your excellence) and borne of high blud / who will
not approve my doing? If I dedicate my small peynes to you my especial good
lord and patron / who can reprove me? Nor the smalnes of this work shall not
withdraw me to ascriue hit to your magnifice^ce: for often times in small and
compe^dious rules / are wount to be enclosed great wisdom and learning / as
says Beroaldus in these verses: Sunt hec parua quidem fatcor: sed magna
subinde
Esse solent paruis deteriora bonis.
Hoc adamas / gemineque docent: que corpore parno
Oblectant reges / diuitibusque placent.
Nos contra horremus magnos persepe gygantes.
Terremur magnis sepe voluminibus.


And of a man of my degree and fortune / what other thing might be offered to
your excellence so rich / so high in dygnite? Statius writes for Rutilius
Gallus / Sepe deis hos inter honores.
Cespes / et exiguo placuerunt farra salino.


Farthermore if master Agapetus abashed not to write this his little book
unto ye emperor Justinian / I without blame may dedicate ye same to your
goodness. I confess hit a small thing / but than I say hit is a book of great
wisdom and lernyng / co^teynynge all these precepts / by the which not
only a prince / but all other estates may learn to do justice / may learn
how by humanite and gentylnes to order their subjects / ad servants. Is
this small book tha^ unworthy to be much made of? unworthy to be dedicate to
your excellence? unworthy to be accepted? unworthy often to be turned? Is it a
light thing for a prince / to learn justly how to rule his people / and to
tempre every thing by Justice? Let them therefore that will dispreise this small
work because it is small / but my trust is / that your excelle^ce / not
considering the smalnes thereof / but the brefe preceptis of greatte wisdom
and learning therein contryued: will not only preyse hit / but also (by goddis
grace) still contynually ensewe the same. Thus I commend (...) to your
excellence / desyryng your ge^tylnes gentylly (as ye be accustomed to do) to
accept this my rude translacion.

The precepts of Agapetus to the emperor Justinian.
Considering o mighty Emperor thou have the highest and honorableste dignite
of all dignites: thou should honor and worship hy^ above all other / which
has reputed the worthy of such honor. For why / god in likeness of his
celestial empere / has delivered to the / the scepter and governance of this
world / to instruct and teach thy subjects to keep justice / and to punyshe
them / which persuade the contrary / following and obeyenge his laws and his
preceptis / and ordering thy subjects as right and equite requirethe.

ii. As the governor of a ship in tempest does watch diligently both for
his own sauegarde and his: so an emperor must keep such diligent watch /
that equite and justice be in surete: and so strongely repelle the vehement
wawes of iniquite / that the ^^ot of his worldly co^monwelth be not frushed and
broken with the wawes of wickedness.

iii. Therefore we mortal men specially are taught and i^structed with holy
scripture / to know our self. For who that knows him self / shall know
god: and he yt knows god / shall be likened to god: truly he shall be likened
to god / that is goddis servant: he is goddis servant / that does nothing
contrary to goddis commandment / but that he thinks be perteynynge to god:
he speaks as he thinks / and does as he speaks: which thing no man may
do effectually / with out perpetual contynuance in goodness.

iiii. No man should glorify or delight in the nobilite of his kyndrede. For
why / both rich and pour be engendered of earth. Therefore no man ought to
exalte and praise his vile and erthly kyndrede / but only glorify and rejoice
in good and godly manners.

v. O man look and know thou / that the higher thou art by goddis help in
dignite: so much thou art more in his debt: therefore thank thy benefactour
thereof / which acceptethe that is due to him as merit / and for frendshyppe
does frendshyppe: god is always the first that gives / and yet as he were our
detter / he quiteth again our goodness to him showed. only requirynge for his
gentylnes and kyndenes to us / effectual love and thanks.

vi. Truly there is nothing that makes a man so commendable or preyse worthy /
as to do / that he desires to do: and to will and do / that is good and
rightous. Considering than that this power is given the by almighty god / of
the which in our be half thou had great need: thou shalt will and do
nothing / but as god (that has given the such faculte and power) wylleth and
commands. For truly nothing is more pleasant both to god and man / than to
do justice.

7. The unsteadfastness of these worldly riches ensue and follow the course of
flowyng waters / which riches he shall possess and enjoy but a while that
thinks hy^ self of them most sure. For shortly after / with the falling
water / they will leave him and enriche some other. Therefore good and merciful
deeds be to man most sure and steadfast: for the merit of them returns
evermore to the profit of the good deed doers.

viii. Because of this high and worldly empere thou art hard to be spoken with
all: and yet by reason of such power thou should humiliate thy self: and
therefore ye spedilier admyt pour me^ to thy speech and presence. Thou shalt
therefore the sooner (following goddis rules) listen to pour men / that god may
in thy necessite both kyndly harken to the / and also help the. For look how
we order other / so of god we shall be ordered.

ix. The pe^s;iful and troubled mind of an emperor must be evermore as pure
as the glass / that so hit may by divine and godly light / continually glyster
and shine: and also that he by quietness of mind may learn distinct and true
knowelege of things. For truly there is nothing yt causes man so well to
mark and be hold what is to be done / as a quiet mind and clear conscience.

x. Like as the mariner / a little going out of course / hurts and is noyfull
to those that sail with him: and as the ship by negligence of the governor
peryssheth and goes to wrack: even so do the citees. For if a subject do
amys / he hurts him self more grievously than the wealth publyke: but when the
ruler / the governor / or prince mysdoeth / he hurts ye holle co^munalte:
Therefore for as much as he must give a strayte count if he rule not well: hit
were needful that he with exquysite diligence both speak and do every thing /
and so avoid all danger.

xi The cercle and whele of these worldly things be often times turned / the
which are turned sometime this way sometime that way. Truly in these things is
no equalite: for in them is neither consta^ce nor yet any sure fu^dacio^.
Therefore o most mighty emperor among these changeable mouynges / and
vnstedynes of things / look that thou have a steadfast thought and mind /
with true feythe and pity.

xii. Thou shall fly and withstand the entycyng co^municacion of flatterers /
as thou woldeste eschew a sort of ravening crows. For crows pecke out the
corporal eyes: but flatterers blind the understanding of man's soul / when
they will not suffer him to perceive the truth of things: for either they
preyse things that are worthy to be dispreised / or else dispreise things most
worthy to be preysed: so that one of these two must needs follow / that is /
either ye commendacion and laud of ill and wicked caytyues / orels the
contempt and dispreyse of good men.

xii. An emperors mind must always be constant. For why / to change with every
wauery^g and unsteadfast thing / is a token of an inconstaunt mind. Therefore
thou should cleue and affixe thy self to good and virtuous men / which
shall stablishe and make steadfast thy kingdom and empere. Nor thou should
not proudly eleuate thy self / nor yet without reason to much submytte thy
self: but prudently after the use and custom of wise men / surely to ground
the inconstance. For who so ever grondely thynkethe upon the disceitfulnes of
this life: and will also behold the vileness and shortness thereof: considering
farthermore the bodily fylthines / he will never wax proud / be he in never
so high a dignite.

xiiii. Above all other precious ornamentis that any kingdom has / ye crown
of pite and of divine service does most hight and ornate a kyngis and an
emperors majesty. For why / erthely richesse / favor of the co^munalte /
laud and preyse do soon vanishe away / but the glory of good and virtuous
life / is immortal / and shall never be forgotte.

xv. Me thinks hit much inconvenient / that the poor man and the rich
should suffer like harm by contrary and diverse causes: the rich by abundance
and great welfare are corrupted: ye pour perish through famyne and scarsite.
Farther more the rich possesses all the world / the pour man has not where
he may set his foot. Therefore / to the intent that they both may be help /
they must be ruled by deduction / that is / the rich must give to the pour:
and so the inequalite shall be brought to equalite.

xvi. The time and season of prosperous life / which certain old prophettis
did pronosticate should come / when wise men should govern and rule / or
kings wax philosophers / is now manifested and opened: for truly you
gyuynge now and appliyng your self to philosophy and wisdom / are esteemed
worthy to be rulers: but specially when in your auctorite and governing / ye
decline not from reason and wisdom. For if to love wisdom makes the
philosopher / and the beginning of wisdom is the fere of god / which ye must
ever more remember: who can say / but my writing is true / and as clear as true?

xvii. For certain we affirm the to be an emperor / saying thou wylt
overcome and subdue thy voluptuous pleasures. and than thou art crowned with
the ^^^deme of Chastity / and tha^ thou show thy self arrayed with the ^urpul
robe of Justice. As for all other things vanishe away: these virtues be
immortal: al other pleasures and worldly dignites peryshe: but as these
virtues be fer from al perell / so they be everlasting.

xviii. If thou wylt be beloved and honored of all men / look thou help all
men. For certeynly there is nothing that causes a man to be beloved and honored
so soon / as to help and succor pour me^: for ye capping and knelyng that
is done for fear / is fucate and figured flattery of feyned honor.

xix. Thy empere by all right and reason is therefore the more worthy to be
honored and preysed / that it fears and keeps his e^nemies under: and
showing to his subiectis al kyndnes keeps them in good prosperity. Therefore as
it ouercometh his e^nmies by strength of arms / so his subjects by charity
and good love surmou^t and overcome his gentylnes and goodness: truly between
these.ii. kinds of humanite and love is no more difference / than is between
the tame sheep and other wild beastis.

xx. Though an emperor i^ body be like all other / yet in power he is like god
/ and master of al men. For in earth he has no pere. Therefore as god be thou
never chafed or angry / as man be thou never proud. For though you be like god
i^ face / yet for all that thou art but earth: which thing techeth the to be
egall to every man.

xxi. Accept and favor them ye give the good counsel / but not those that
flatter the: good cou^seilers consider what ought to be done: flatterers
consider what may please me^ of might: which flatterers are like men's
shadows: for they gaynesay nothing / but allow and preise what ever is said.

xxii. Be so to thine / as thou would that god should be to the. For as we
here other / so we shall be hard / and as we favor other / so god will favor
us. Therefore let us first show mercy and be merciful / that in like manner we
may opteyne mercy.

xxiii. As a fair glass expresses the very true fisnomy of man / that is of
goodly and beutifull persons their beutifulnes: and of ill favored their ill
favor: so the rightousnes and equite of god is likened to our deeds. For after
our deeds / god will reward us.

xxiiii. Do that y^e entende coldly / but yet do hit spedily yt ye purpose to
do. For folishe hastynes in every thing is very perilous. Truly who yt
marketh diligentely / what mischief ryseth of hastynes / shall soon perceive
and like wise understand the co^modite of good cou^seile / as sick folk aft
their sickness understand the pleasure of health. Therefore most prudent prince
with sage cou^seile and devout prayers made to god / look thou diligently
search and inquere what shall be profitable for the / to rule and govern this
world.

xxv. Thou shall best govern thy noble empere / if thou ouerse al things thy
self / and suffer nothing neglige^tly to pass. Nor it is not a small thing
in the / that in comparison of thy subjects appears to be small. For the
leest word of an emperor / is among all folks right highly esteemed / and of
great auctorite.

xxvi. Because there is no erthly man that can co^straine the to observe and
keep thy laws / enforce thy self to use and keep them. For if thou diligently
observe them / thou shall manifestly show / that the law is worthy to be
observed / and the breker of hit / worthy to be punyshed.

xxvii. It is one thing to syn / and not to chastise sinners. For who so ever
dwells in a cite / and there in suffers wicked livers / before god he is an
ill liver. Therefore if thou wylt be esteemed to be indifferent / honor them yt do
well / and punyshe them that do ill.

xxviii. I think hit very expedient to eschew ill company. For who yt is
co^uersant with ill lyuers / shall either suffer harm / or learn some ill. But
he that leads his life among good and honest company / either he shall learn
to follow honesty / orels to diminishe his fautes and vices.

xxix. Since it is so yt god has given to the rule of all the world / look you
use no ill officers. For he that promoteth them shall answer for their offenses.
Therefore great offices must be delige^tly given / and well and wisely bestowed.

30. I esteem these two things to be like ill / to be chafed with ye leude
deling of our e^nemie / or to be mollified with the pleasant sweet wordis of our
fre^des. For we ought to resist and with stand them both / that is / never to
decline from comelines / another in reue^gyng the unreasonable ill will of our
foos / nor in rewarding the feyned beniuolence of our friend and lover.

31. Esteem not those thy feythful fre^des / that will preyse al things that
thou spekest: but those / which with out any feyning / do all that they can
for the: and be glad and rejoice / when thou say or do any thing well /
and again be sorry and heavy / if thou do or say ill. For certain these
betokens of friendship aborryng all fraud.

32. Let not the greatness and might of this thy erthly empere change thy noble
mind / but ruling thy frail empere / and subject to diverse fortunes / have
among these mutable things a steadfast and i^mutable mind / not lifting up
thy self by to much joy / nor yet hurty^g thy self by to much heaviness and
sorrow. For like as gold though it by craft and wit of man be turned now
thus now other wise / and wrought in diverse fashions of ornaments: yet hit
remains gold still nor will not be changed from his nature: so thy self most
noble emperor / though from grice to grice haste borne one office after an
other / and art come to the most highest honor / yet thou remaynest ye same
thing thou were. Keep you therefore among these diuersites of things an
inalterable and a constant mind / the which from this worldly empere / shall
bring the to perpetual blys and joy everlasting.

33. If thou wylt have ye dominion of thy empere commended / deem thine own
offenses as worthy punyssheme^t as ye defautes of thy subiectis. For in this
world no man / but only thyn own conscience can punish the.

34. He that opteyneth high power and dignite should ensue and follow as nere
as he may / ye gyuer thereof. For if the emperor represent god / lord of al
thing / and by his liberalite has the governance of every thing: he than
(but namely i^ this point) shall follow him / and esteem no erthly thy^g so
precious / or so much of man to be desired / as to be mylde and merciful.

35. Above gold and precious stone we should lay up as treasure ye riches of
well doing. For they in this p^sent life / through hope of the fruicion to come
will delight us: and in ye life to come / by experience and taste of everlasting
joy / they shall be to us sweet and pleasant. These worldly things / ye seem to
us pleasant / should be eschewed and utterly avoided / as unmeet / and nothing
perteyninge to us / yt they by enticement disceyue us not.

36. Look thou quite them with gay rewards / which with good will do thy
co^mandeme^tes. For by ye mean thou shall encreace ye courage of good men / and
teach ye yldoers to lament their offenses. For it were to much unjust deling
to reward alike as well them ye deserved not as deserved it.

37. Than truly the empere excedeth all other things / when ye ruler thereof
enclyneth not to indiscreet cruelnes / but to amiable equite and justice /
fleing beastly cruelnes / and ensuyng godly kyndnes.

38. As Well thou shall judge rightfully thy e^nemy as thy friend / not fauory^g
thy friend for frendshyp / nor hurtyng thy e^nemy for hatred. For it is a like
inco^uenie^ce and offense / to help thy friend desiryng that is against eqte /
as it is to hurt thy e^nemy demanding justice: ye misdede in both cases is
like / though ye persons be diverse.

39. Iuges must diligently harken to their causes. For hit is a very hard
thing breuely to perceive ye truth / the which from negligent persons soon
skapeth. But if a rightful judge will leave the feyned eloquence of attourneis /
and considering the true ente^cio^ will fly ye likelyhod of causes / he shall
shortly perceive ye troth. And farthermore avoid.ii. diverse fautes / that is
/ they shall neither do / nor yet permit any other to do against honesty.

xl. Though thou have as many virtues / as be sterris i^ ye firmament / yet
thou shall never overcome the goodness of god. For what so ever we offer to god
/ we offer to hy^ but his own. And as no man can go fro or before his shadow
in ye son / always going before or nere following him: so ye goodness of god is
insuperable / and can not be exceded with good warkes of any man.

xli. The treasure of liberalite is infinite. For who that liberally spe^deth
gets / and spending his goods other gether them. Look than most liberal
emperor: yt thou mind those things: and that thou give largely to pour men.
For when the time of rewards and thanks shall come / tha^ for this thy
liberalite / thou shall have infinite thanks and great luker.

xlii. Seeing thou haste opteyned and gotten thy kingdom by god / follow thou
him in all good warkes / that men may know thy liberalite. For thou art of the
number of them that may do good / and not of pour me^ and those that covet to
be helped. For god therefore has given the so abunda^t riches to help and
succor pour men.

xliii. An emperor is no otherwise ordained to rule the world / tha^ man's
eyes to rule and watch for the sauegarde of his body. He is deputed of god to
ministre those things / that may be profitable for man. Therefore an emperor
ought to do none otherwise for all men / than he would do for him self: that so
by his tuicio^ they may avoid al dangers / and prospere in goodness.

xliiii. Think thou the most sure defense of thy prosperity / to hurt nor to
injury no man. For he that offe^deth no man / suspecteth no man. If than to
injury no man does cause good custody and sauegarde: then truly by liberalite
thou shall ye sooner opteyne hit. For as liberalite gets and enge^dreth
defense: so it co^serueth good and honest love. For if we do that is honest /
men will love and keep us.

xlv. Be thou (o most mekest emperor) to thy subjects through thy excellent
power / terrible: and by thy liberalite and goodness be thou amiable. Nor you
should not by to much favor / set at light and nothing regard thy high
power: nor yet regarding to much thy power / despise favor. But kepy^g a mean
/ thou shall as well show lovely kyndnes to thy subjects / as by asperite and
sharpnes chastise to great familiarite.

xlvi. Such things as you by word do p^scribe to thy subjects / look by
example of pure life thou acco^plishe. For if thou do reason / and with reason
doste live as thou say / every man shall greatly commend the.

xlvii. Love them most noble emperor / that mekely desire thy gifts / more
than those / which diligently desire to give ye gifts. For these thou art
bound to thank / and also to reward them: the other truly shall assine god to
thank ye / which reputeth to be given to him / and for his love / what so
ever is given or done for pour men.

xlviii. The virtue of the son is to illuluminate the world / themperours
virtue is to be merciful / and to help pour men. Truly a meke and a merciful
prince excedeth ye brightness of ye son: for ye son gives place to ye night but
a good virtuous prince suffers no extorcio^ / but by ye light of truth and
justice / he castiseth iniquite.

xlix. Thy predecessors have greatly ornated their empere / but thou truly by
thy humanite and affabilite / not esteming thy ryal and mighty power / have
much more greatly ornated it. Wherefore al they yt need mercy ru^ne to thy
grace / which delivered from their pouerte and aduersite / do highly thank
the.

l. Look how much thou excellest al other in power and dignite / so much ye
more you shuldst endeuer the / by noble and virtuous deeds to excelle and shine
above all other. For high power reqreth great honesty. God also will require /
thou help (after thy power) needful and honest persons. Therefore if you desire
to be truly preysed / and to be by god / as it were by a tro^peter declared a
co^queror: join you to ye crown of thy invincible e^pere / by helping ye
pour) ye crown of everlasting joy.

li. Er thou co^mande that right and equite persuadeth / look thou well upon it.
For verily so thou shall evermore co^mande that right is. Man's tongue is a very
slippery instrument / ye which has brought many one i^ to great peril and
danger. Therefore if you prefixe to the forsaid instrument yt is goodly and
honest / hit shall sou^de only yt is pleasant / and right to be executed and
done.

lii. A prince i^ al things must be subtle and wise / but namely in iuginge
of great and weighty causes / seldom angry / and not to be angry without a
great cause. But because never to be angry is not laudable / an emperor to
refrain the furiousnes of misdoers / and yt men may purge their fautes / shall
measurably use his anger.

liii. Look you be dilligent to know perfetly the manners and co^dicions of thy
servants / and of all those / which charity enforces the to love. And also
be you diligent to know those / which disceitfully do flatt ye. For often times
disceitful lovers and flaterers do great hurt.

liiii. When so ever thou herest such co^municacion or counsel / ye may
profit / do not only here hit / but also follow it. For truly ye emperors
majesty is than ornated / when he him self co^sidereth / what is necessary to
be done: and despises not other men's profitable inuecions and counsel / and
is not ashamed to learn / and quickly executes that he has learned.

lv. As a castle / which by reason of his strong walls is invincible / and
sets light by his e^nemies: so thy empere / well walled with liberalite and
fortified with devout prayer / is inui^cible / and by goddis help shall
triumph of his aduersares and e^nemes.

lvi. Use so this inferior kingdom / that it may be to ye a way to ye kingdom
of heaven. For who so ever governs well this erthly kingdom / is esteemed
worthy to opteyne celestial joy and pleasure. He ruletth this world
rightfully / that charitably loves his subjects / and of his subjects is
duly honored and dredde / and wha^ he procures / that none occasion of ill be
among them.

lvii. Liberalite and charitable deeds is a perpetual and incorrupt garment.
Therefore who so ever will raygne charitably / must ornate and clothe his soul
with such goodly vesture and apparaile. For who that helps ye pour men /
shall opteyne joy everlasting.

lviii. Co^sidring that god has given the / ye imperial scepter / look thou
endeuer thy self utterly to please him. And because he has preferred ye above
al other: thou must honor him above al other. Truly god estemeth hit the most
singularst benefit yt thou can do him / to defend his creatures as thy
self / and liberally to help them as bound thereto.

lix. Every man yt desires his health must call upon god / but specially the
emperor / which labors for the wealth of al men. And he defended by god /
shall as well overcome his ennemies as defend his subjects.

lx. God needs nothing. An emperor has only need of god. Therefore follow him
yt has no need / and show mercy abu^da^tly to them yt ask it. not rekening
straightly thy expe^ses of house hold: but rather help every man yt desires to
live. For it is better to help ye vnworthi for honest men's sakis tha^ for ye
vice of ye unworthy to defraude the worthy of that they deserved.

lxi. As you would have forgyuenes of thy sins / so forgive other yt the
offe^de. God forgyueth them yt forgive. and where forgiveness is / there is god.

lxii. A prince yt would demene hy^ fautlesly / must diligently take heed / yt
his people be vtuous / and yt he be ashamed to syn / and yt he give no open
example to other to do am^s / and yt he absteyne privately lest he offend
openly. For if subiectis be ashamed to do amys / much more yeir ruler ought to
be ashamed.

lxiii. It is a private ma^s vice to do ill and live viciously / but a prince to
forget his own wealth and honesty is much more vicious. For ye abstine^ce
from ill does not justify man / but ye doing of honesty and goodness.
Therefore no man should only absteyne from ill / but also endeuer him to do
justice.

lxiiii. Death dredeth neither king nor emperor / but egally deuoureth every
man. Therefore before his fearful coming / let us gether our riches in heaven.
For no man can carry worldly riches thither / but all left in ertthe / he shall
there naked give aco^pt of his life

lxv. As an e^peror is lord of al me^ / so with all other he is goddis servant.
And shall tha^ be called a lord / wha^ he by vtue of chastity ouercometh his
sensual lustis / and with an inui^cible my^de despises the transitory
pleasures and joys of this world.

lxviii. As ma^s shadow follows the body / so syn follows ye soul: which
soul ones separated from ye mortal body / shall give arekening to god of his
good and ill deeds. Nor tha^ is no time to deny any thing. For every man's deed
shall bear witness / not by word but representinge and openinge every man's deed
/ as he did hit.

lxix. As a ship having wind at will bri^geth ye passagers often times into ye
haue^ sooner tha^ they would a thought so ye swift time of this mortal life
passes away / and we aproche to our end: Therefore let us leave to love worldly
things / which this world estemeth so much / and let us studi how to get to
ye port of heaven / where is no wayling / but eternal joy and pleasure.

lxx. No man by reason of his dignite should be haute and proud / but
considering ye substance of ye flesh / should repress the swelling pride of
heart. For though he be made a prince i^ earth / yet he must my^de / he was
engendered of earth: and yt from earth he ase^ded to ye seat royal / and from
ye seat roial he shall again desce^de to vile^ earth and ashes.

lxxi. Be never careless prince most excellent. and as they yt go up a ladder
stint not til they come to ye highest ro^ge or grice: so you desiring to have
vtu / shul dest never cesse till you come to ye kingdom of heaven. Which thing
Christ / ye keeper and encrecer of all thing (whose name me^ shall glorify and
preise etnally) grant the and ye empress thy wife.
