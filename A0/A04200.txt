A STRANGE AND TRVE RELATION of a Ship of BRISTOL named the JACOB, of 120.
Tons, which was about the end of October. last 1621. taken by the Turkish
Pirates of Argier: and how within five days after, four English Youths did
valiantly overcome thirteen of the said Turks, and brought the Ship to SAINT
LVCAS in SPAIN, where they sold nine of the TVRKES for Galley-slaues.
AS all Relations of any goodness that befalls to men, or of any evil that
they are defended or delivered from, are manifest declarations of Gods power in
man's weakness, and the richness of the Almighties mercy graciously extended to
our poverty and misery, wherein from time to time in all ages the
omnipotency of the Creator has protected and regarded the impotencie of his
creatures, thereby to stir us up to the love, fear and obedience of his
eternal Majesty.

Omitting therefore to fill up this discourse with many old examples, or to
delay the Readers expectation with impertinent stuff, I will here relate
briefly and in succinct and plain manner, the strange and true deliverance of
a ship and four English Mariners: in which report I doubt not, but God will be
glorified, and those that read or hear it well satisfied.

Near the latter end of October last, 1621. a ship belonging to the City of
Bristoll, being about the burden of 120. Tons, was met withal and set upon
by Turks or Pirates of Argier, where after a long and sharp fight (being in
the mouth of the Straits of Gibraltar) the English ship being oppressed with the
multitude of their enemies, was taken, their Ordnance, Cables, Anchors, Sails,
Ship and men pillaged, ransacked, and at the mercy of the insulting Barbarians,
who to make their work the surer, took all the Englishmen out of the ship,
except four youths, whose names were John Cook, William Ling, David Jones,
and Robert Tuckey, into which ship the Turks did put thirteen of their own
men to command the English, and to bring the ship as a prize to Argier; amongst
which one of the Pirates was appointed Captain, being a strong, able, stern,
and resolute fellow.

These four poor youths being thus fallen into the hands of merciless
Infidels, began to study and complot all the means they could for the
obtaining of their freedoms: First they considered the lamentable and
miserable estates that they were like to be in, as to be debard for ever from
seeing their friends and Country, to be chained, beaten, made slaves, and to
eat the bread of affliction in the Galleyes all the remainder of their
unfortunate lives, to have their heads shaven, to feed on course diet, to have
hard boords for beds, and which was worst of all, never to be partakers of the
heavenly word and Sacraments. These and the like heavy and sad cogitations
were like so many whetstones to sharpen their wits, to devise means for their
deliverance, and withal their desperate cases were spurs to rowse their
courages to attempt any dangerous exploit for their enlargement, for they did
consider wisely that death was better then bondage, and that noble resolutions
were the begetters or forerunners of worthy actions, which made them resolve
rather then they would suffer a slavish life, to try the hazard of a memorable
death.

Thus being quite hopeless, hapless, and for any thing they knew, for ever
helpless, they sailed five days and nights under the command of the Pirates,
when on the fifth night, God in his great mercy showed them a means for their
wished-for escape, for in the dead of the night the wind began to rise, and in
short space it blew so stiff that they were enforced to strike both their top
sails; and at last it increased to such a gust or storm, that they must take
in their maine Sail, and being unable to do it themselves, John Cook and
William Ling did call to the Turks for help: whereupon the Captain himself
came to help them; who standing by the ships side, between the aforesaid John
and David Jones, lending his hand to hale in the sail, the said John and David
suddenly took him by the breech and threw him over board, but by fortune he
fell into the bunt of the sail, where quickly catching hold of a rope, he
(being a very strong man) had almost gotten into the ship again: which John
Cook perceiving, leaped speedily to the Pumpe, and took off the Pumpe brake
or handle, and cast it to William Ling, bidding him knock him down, which he
was not long in doing, but lifting up the wooden weapon he gave him such a
palt on the pate, as made his brains forsake the possession of his head, with
which his body fell into the Sea.

An Objection may be made here, why the Turk cried not to his fellows at
first for help, or how these things could be done but the rest of his company
must either see or hear it: to which I answer, that at Sea a Gust, Flaw, or
Storm, has many times a louder voice then a man; besides when Mariners do
hale or pull any thing, they do make a noise, as it were crying ha woet hale
men hale, which with the noise of the wind whizzing and hizzing in the shrowdes
and cordage, would overcome and drown the voice or cry of any man whatsoever.
Besides, his companions were all busy, some at the mizen, some at the
spritsaile, some to trim the fore-saile, and the night exceeding dark, all
these things concurring, and chiefly God graciously assisting, thus these brave
Lads began the business luckily.

Nor must I forget Robert Tuckey, who was imployd all this while in a place of
maine importance, for he stood at the Helm, and in all the weather guided the
ship; now after the Captain was thus cashierd, John Cook ran hastily up the
half deck to the Masters Cabin, near which were standing six or seven
Turks, but he being nothing daunted or discouraged for them, slipped roughly by
them, and gat out two good cuttleaxes, or short swords, one of which he
delivered to William Ling, withal saying, Courage my fellows and country
men, God strengthen and assist us; with that they laid about them so manfully,
that they drove the Turks from place to place in the ship, and having coursed
them from the Poope to the Forecastle, they there valiantly killed two of them,
and gave another a dangerous wound or two, who to escape the further fury of
their swords, leap't suddenly ouerboord to go seek his Captain. Thus four
of the thirteen Turks being made sure for doing any harm, they chased and
followed the other nine so close, that they (to save themselves) being also
many of them sore hurt and wounded, ran between the ships decks; whereupon the
English men fastened the decks to keep them under: the Turks, not knowing how
to be revenged, ran aftward toward the helm, and vnshipt their whipstaffe, or
as some call it a whipstocke, (which is the staff that a Mariner holds in his
hand, when he guides or steeres a ship) by which means the English men were
in some distress, by reason the ship lay tumbling and rolling unguided in the
raging and boystrous billows of the Sea: at last John Cook and William Ling
got each of them a Musket, which they quickly charged, and went down where the
nine Turks were, making offers to shoot at them, at which they were much
terrified; whereupon they quickly shipped their whipstocke again, delivering
the helm to Robert Tuckey, and then presently they stowed all the Turks under
the hatches, where they kept them close till the next morning, and then as they
had occasion to use them, they would call up two or three of them at a time, to
hale and pull sheets, tacks, braces, and boleins, to hoyse and strike sails,
or any such necessary and laborious employments, in all which the English made
the Turks attend them, and directing their course for the Port of Saint Lucas
in Spain, they in short time (by Gods aid) happily and safely arrived at the
said Port, where they sold the nine Turks for Gally-slaues, for a good sum
of money, and as I think a great deal more then they are worth.

Thus have I set down a true relation and description of these men's Captivity,
and joyful deliverance, in which the Reader may see the instability of humane
accidents, and that the supernall power and providence has a ruling hand to
dispose all the purposes of men to his own glory, and the good of those that
depend upon him. For what expectation of redress or comfort could these
distressed youths have, they being but four in number, their enemies being
their masters, and thirteen to the dozzen, strong, lusty, able, and merciless
Turks: In the reason of man, the poor men's case was desperate and past
recovery; but see, Gods arm is not shortened, he that overcame Pharaoh with
Lice, Grasshoppers, Froggs, and Caterpillars, to make Gedeon victorious with the
breaking of Earthen Pitchers, to cause Foxes with firebrarnds to consume the
Corn of the Philistims; to make Sampson kill a thousand men, with a silly
Asses saw bone, to strengthen David (being but a young Lad, and a Shepherd)
that with his own hands he slew a raging Lion, and a ravening Bear, and after
that with a sling and a stone, to conquer and kill a mighty Giant: Innumerable
are the examples that I could recite in this kind, but they are so manifest
and frequent, that with admiration and adoration, our humane reason is struck
blind and dumb, whilst our faith with thankfulness should ascend to the
author of our happiness.

Nor can I forget to commend unto memory the good and well bestowed courage of
these four young men, for as a wise man said, the talk of a soldier ought to
hang upon the point of his sword, and courage cannot justly be called courage
but where the cause is just, and their cause being good, they thought it more
courage to dye free, then to live slaves, they contemned all dangers, they
despised all miseries, and they with fortitude conquered their Conquerors: How
many dejected slaves would have sat whining like whelps, and like vassals
have put their necks into the noose of perpetual servitude, crying only, God
help, but never endeavoring to use the means that God has given them, whilst
these brave sparks and spirits, the darlings of valor, to their own long
lasting fame and their countries never dying honor, makes Bristoll famous,
Britain glorious, their reputations precious, and the Turks contemptuous.

Had John Cook been some Collonell, Captain, or Commander, or William Ling,
some nauigating Lord, or David Jones some gentleman of land and riches, or had
Robert Tuckey been one of fortunes minions, to have had more money then wit, or
more wealth then valor, oh what a triumphing had here been then, what rare
Muses would have toyld like Mules, to have gallopt with their flattering
encomiums, beyond the 32. points of the compass; whilst these 4 rich caskets
of homespun valor and courage, have no pen to publish their deserved
commendations, no invention to emblazon their saltwater honor, but the poor
lines and labors of a freshwater Poet.

Nor do I write this to the intent that any man should presume that their own
strengths, valor, or courage is sufficient to do these or the like actions,
for they are not ordinary, and therefore man is but made the ordinary
instrument of an extraordinary power, and he that shall attribute such things
as these to the arm of flesh and blood, is forgetful, ungrateful, and in a
manner Atheistical.

One John Fox an expert Mariner, and a good approved and sufficient Gunner, was
(in the reign of Qu. Elizabeth) taken by the Turks, and kept eighteen years
in most miserable bondage and slavery, at the end of which time, he espied his
opportunity, (and God assisting him withal) that he slew his keeper, and fled
to the seas side, where he found a Gally with one hundred and fifty captive
Christians, which he speedily waying their Anchor set sail, and fell to work
like men, and safely arrived in Spain, by which means he freed himself and a
number of poor souls from long and intolerable servitude, after which the
said John Fox came into England, and the Queen (being rightly informed of his
brave exploit) did graciously entertain him for her servant, and allowed him a
yearly pension.

Captain Nicolls with a ship of London called the Dolphin, fought a long and
bloody fight, with many of the Turkish men of war at one time, at which time
he sunk some of them, slew many of their men, and having his own ship
exceedingly rent and torn with the enemies great shot, yet at last it pleased
God to deliver him from them, so that he safely arrived at home.

Master William Malam of Rotherhith, within these three years was set upon by
these Rouers, and after a long fight, being much hurt by the Ordnance of the
Turks, (the night coming on) which made the fight to cease, when the General
of the Pirates past his word, and bound it with an oath, that if M. Malam would
come aboard his ship all night, that he should well and safely be set aboard
again his own ship the next morning, upon which word and oath M. Malam went
aboard the Turk and a Merchant with him; but first before he went commanded
his Mate to watch his opportunity, and steal away with the ship in the night
if he could, which fell out as he wished, whereby all the Merchants goods were
saved, and the ship safely arrived here at London: but in the morning, when
the Turks did perceive the English ship was gone, then would they have put M.
Malam and the Merchant that was with him to death, whereupon he urged him with
his oath and promise, which was that he should come and go safely, and that if
a Christian had made him or any man such a promise, and bound it with a vow,
he would have kept his word. And that (for any thing he knew) his ship being
so dangerously hurt by them might be sunk in the night, and not escaped away
as he imagined. Now whilst they were in this discourse, presently came a sail
in sight, which afterward they found to be a small Scottish ship bound for
England, whom the Turks quickly took, and pillaged at their pleasure, taking
from them their Sails, Cables, Anchors, and all things necessary for their use
or preservation, and having robbed and rifled the poor Scot in that manner,
they put Mr. Malam and the Merchant into her to try their fortunes, either to
sink or swim, but it pleased God they safely arrived in the west part of
England, where they came home by land sad and disconsolate because they could
not hear any news of the ship: but the same night that he came home, before
day there was happy tidings brought of the ships safe arrival into the river
of Thames.

All these things are true upon mine own knowledge, and these worthy Mariners
that have been so delivered, do, and ever did, attribute all the means of
their deliverance to the mighty hand of God; and they are so far from taking
any of these things to their own praise or glory, that some of them have ever
done their best to suppress them from being printed. But as it were a mere
vanity to boast or brag, so I hold it a great pity, that either Gods mercies,
or man's benefits received, should be concealed.

Here is matter sufficient related, to persuade men that as they should not
presumptuously ascribe Gods honor to themselves, so on the other side here are
maine motives and examples to keep men from despair in their greatest
distresses: for as you see here when all man's help failed, then Gods help
prevailed, to whom alone, as it is due, be ascribed all the honor.

FINIS.
