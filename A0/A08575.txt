The Oppugnation and fierce siege of Ostend, by the Archduke Albertus his
Forces, commanded by the Duke of Ossuna, who came before the said Town, the
fifth day of July last past (after their writing) 1601. showing what has happened
since the time of the said siege.
OStend is a town situated on the Flemish coast, lying on the arm of the
river Ype^le, through which the weast Sluice lately ran into the sea, and
has there made a sufficient tide haven, which (like as, for the most part, all the rest of the Flemish havens, do ebb and flow: and cannot be used but with
an high water, or at the least wise, at half flood) does notwithstanding
continually hold, and contain the ditches of the Town full of water, by
reason of Dammes and Sluices made to that end and purpose, which (forasmuch as
it might be in the same course continued, returned, or perhaps by the ennemy
diuerted) they of the Town have, of themselves, stopped the course thereof,
whereby they of the Country of Flaunders, have heene forced to carry and convey
the same by the Forte of Albertus, and so by a new current into the Sea.

In times past, it was but an open village, yet reasonable great, and well
peopled. First, after the coming of Don John d'Austria, in the beginning of
the now wars, for the fit and commodious situation thereof, it was made a
Town, and environed with strong walls: And afterward, this Town only, and
none others among all the rest of the sea towns of Flaunders remained, and at
this present does remain in the possession or amity of the united provinces
of Holland and Zeland, howbeit, it lies in the middle (as it were) of the
ennemies Country, and far from her friends. And yet maugre all the forces,
and power of her enuirouing foes, has many times been valiantly defended
against sundry besiegings and attempts.

For in the year 1583. although the duke of Parma, with his victorious host
(after he had taken Dunkerk, and Newport, the next adjoining sea Towns
westward) did in most furious manner besiege it, using all warlike means he
could possible to conquer it, was forced to give place, and after that he had
continued his siege five days, saw how bootelesse it was for him to spend any
longer time about it, and therefore departed, not effecting any thing agreeable
to his wished attempts.

Afterward, in the year 1585. although Monsieur la Motte Governor of
Graueling, did, with great force and difficulty win the old Town by the
Strand or sea side, which at that time was only defended with a simple wall,
or Raueling and Pallisados, with purpose there presently to entrench and defend
himself, was again with all his forces, like sheep driven out of the same,
leaving behind him forty of his principallest Captains and Commanders with
all their furniture and provision.

This Town, without all question, is a place of great advantage, and
importance, yea of such moment, that it serves as a bulwark and strong
defense, for the whole province of Zeland, and so contrariwise, if it should
fall into the enomies hands (as God forbid) he should thereby command a more
fit and commodious haven for shipping, than any other sea Town now in his
possession can yield him. Yea our intolerable losses, not to be recovered do
teach us, and as it were, with a finger point unto us, what inestimable damage
might redound unto the united Provinces, if the enemy should command in this
Town.

Further, it is to be noted, that the Country of Flaunders, being in peace, in
all taxations of the seauenteene Provinces did leuy the third penny: whereunto
they have been forced by this Town, not only during the time of these wars,
but also, the greatest part of the maine land has been constrained many
years, to pay toll and contribution, and to be under our devotion.

For which causes, this Town has with great care and mighty charges of the
united Provinces bin daily fortified, and continually strengthened, and
especially in the year last past 1600. as also in the fore part of this
present summer: many works, I say, have been devised to withstand, and
prevent the cruel attempts of the bloody ennemy, as bulwarks, counterpoynts,
and Rauelings to the landward, neither has that part lying to the Sea been
forgotten, but has been made also very defencible with heads, banks, and
ditches, and especially on the east side of the Town where (by means of the
weakness of the banks) the sea, with great force is mightily broken into the
land, where it has skowred, and pierced a great depth; so that the chanel of
the new haven (when the water is lowest) is near two, pikes deep: and does
daily wax deeper and deeper, without all doubt, the determinate work of God,
for the great strengthening and plain defense of the Town.

They of Flaunders generally finding what annoyaunnes and great discommoditie
this Town threatened daily unto them, have solicited and by all means possible
importuned their Governors, to besiege, and conquer this Town of Ostend,
their daily eie-sore: as of late years (yet fresh in memory) in the year
1596. after that the Archduke Albertus had taken the Town of Callice, in
France, they required him then to take in hand this piece of work, promising
to give him twelve hundred thousand gilderns within three months time (which
in sterling money is one hundred and twenty thousand pounds) whereunto, after
his Highness had made show to yield, and promised to fulfill their desire, he
got some part of the sum aforesaid into his hands. But doubting the event
of the attempt, or knowing how hard a matter it was, to take it by force of
arms, or how difficult it would be to constrain the soldiers thereof by
hunger, or otherwise, thought it sufficient to show himself before the Town
with his forces, and so quietly to depart.

They of Flaunders herewith nothing at all pleased, and grieved with the
continual vexations and incursions of the ranging soldiers, and payment of
contributions, to prevent the same, in the year of our Lord 1599. while our
forces were employed in the defense of Bommel, had good leisure to make sundry
forts and bulwarks, for the strengthening, and defense of the ways and
passages about the town of Ostend, thereby (as it were with a small kind of
siege) continually to trouble the Town, and to hinder the incursions of the
garrison: which device was put into their heads, and the plotte laid down by a
certain Corporal of the Town called Noel, who having before long served in
the town, and having good experience of the secrets thereof, upon some
coffeehouse received, forsook the Town, and ran to the service of the
enemy.

But as the experience of the last year gives sufficient proof, that all the
strength of these Fortes is not able to hinder, or defend the entrance of an
Host, so also it is most manifest that by the continual charge of the
Garrisons of these Fortes, the Country has received more damage and
discommoditie, then before it did by the contribution to their enemies, and
Town of Ostend; wherefore they have been forced to renew their Importunate
suit unto his Highness, and to solicit him again to the besieging of Ostend,
and especially at this instant, knowing our forces to be removed far from
them, and to be sent into Dutchland lying at the siege of Berck, where they
should (as they imagined) have long work: And for the better persuading, and
more easily drawing of the Archduke to harken to this their suit, have promised
to pay him extraordinarily, three hundredth thousand gilderns Monthly (which is
30 thousand pounds sta^rling) during the time of the siege, and after the
taking of the town to pay him farther (for the space of two years) ninety
thousand gilderns every month (which is 9000. l starling.

Hereupon tha^rchduke gathred together al his soldiers: yea such as were about
the river of Ryne and the Mase, for the succor of Berck were sent for, to make
their repair into Flaunders and to serve under the command of the Duke of
Osluna, who not long since was to that end sent for out of Spain, by reason
that the Archdukes camp (through the long imprisonment of the Adinirant of
Arragon, and the last overthrow in Flaunders) was wholly left destitute and
unprovided of a sufficient Commander, and experient Leaders, and for that the
natural Lords of the land, are in no wise respected nor trusted.

Upon the sift day of June (after the new style) the enemy came before Ostend,
about noone, with eight regiments of footmen, which were eight thousand men
strong, desides the horsemen (notwithstanding the Spaniards generally disliked
of this enterprise, and counseled the contrary, who (as is reported) do wholly
dislike of this siege: and among the rest, two common soldiers that had
been the last year prisoners in Ostend, obstinately maintaining the
invincible strength of this Town, were presently taken and hanged: for the
extreme want of the three hundred thousand gilderns, to be paid monthly, as
before is said, coming very fitly for the payment of the mutined soldiers,
and also the hope to draw our forces from the siege of Bercke, into Flanders,
for the better furnishing of him self, and preventing of such wants as might
happen to Ostend: and perhaps thinking suddenly, and with all his force to
ouercharge the town before it should be succored, have bin the resons to bring
th Archdukes forces now before Ostend.

The Duke of Ossuna presently sought to pacisie the garrison of Issabella,
which had before mutined for their pay: and the next day following, being the
fixed day of July, mounted six pieces of ordonance against the east side of the
town upon the Downs, and with the same began fiercely to play upon the
Town.

There were then in the town in garrison one and twenty Ancients of sundry
Regiments, and one company of Burgers, or Townsmen, all under the direction
and command of Captain Vander Noote. These presently prepared themselves to
their defense, making harmless, and displacing some of the enemies
artillery: And laboring hard, to make a new way or haven, between the heads,
to the end the passage of boats and shipping might be freeed from the
ordonaunce of the ennemy.

And the ninth day of July, after that they had sent away the most part of
their wives and children, they received into the town (out of Zeland) 28.
companies of soldiers, with great abundance of victuals, and all other
provision of war.

The tenth day sir Frances Vere, with eight companies of Englishmen entered into
the Town also, who presently issued out of the Town with his people,
entrenching himself on the dry plottes of ground next unto the walls, on the
west side, from whence the enemy might have endomaged the town, and battered
the walls.

The thirteenth day of July, the said sir Frances Vere, with great force and
resolution sallied upon the enemy with eight hundred men, on the west part of
the town, and set upon the Camp, which lay far off divided from each other,
with waters and marish grounds, and can not easily, or in short time come to
aid each other. In which sally, the ennemy lost (as was certified by Letters
from Antwerpe) above eight hundred men, and among the same, one cornet of
horsemen: and, if the whole force of the ennemies horsemen, had not the sooner
come to their aid, it was most apparent to all men's judgments, that sir
Frances had drouen the footmen to great confusion, and taken from them their
Ordonance.

The five and twentieth day sir Frances Vere did again issue out of the Town
with fifteen hundred men, and began to entrench between Issabella and
Grootendorst, on a high ground, which in times past was an old Churchyard,
where they of Issabella and Grootendorst were accustomed to bury their dead,
and is a very fit and apt place, to separate and cut off these two Fortes
from each others help, and to open a fair way to those of Ostend, to the
flat and plain land. To which place of burial, the next day, being the
five and twentieth day of July, the ennemy came with three thousand men, and
after he had been thrice repulsed, and put to the woorst, took the place,
but was presently with great force and dexterity driven from it again.

The same day ten companies of soldiers arrived at Ostend, and were received
into the Town, which were sent thither by her Majesty from London, so that
now the Town was furnished (within the walls and without) with sixty and
seven companies, which made up near the number of seven thousand men: these
ten companies aforesaid, were presently employed against the enemy, who
showed themselves very valorous, and did, both then, and since, passing good
service, although many men were of opinion, that they would prove vnsitte for
any service by reason they were raw, and had not been trained.

On the other side, the Arch duke daily strengthens and increases his Camp,
as well with soldiers, as with ordonance, playing continually on the west side
with 26. pieces, and on the east side with nine pieces of ordonance, but most
of his shot liteth upon the houses, whereof many are defaced and beaten
down: For, this six and twentieth day of July, and before, there had been
discharged upon the Town sixteen thousand shot, and against the ennemie from
the Town had been counterchanged six thousand.

Moreover, there were also received into the Camp some part of the new
soldiers which came out of Italy, and had been appointed for the succor of
Berke, for first there arrived eight hundred men of those companies, and
afterward five and twenty hundred more were sent for, part Italians, and part
Spaniards: and besides these, xx. men more out of all the other Ancients under
the government of the Erie of Barlamont and Bucquoy, who, for this cause, were
forced to discharge their wagons, and other provisions, before by them taken
up, and meant to be used in raising the siege before Bercke.

There are eighteen companies appointed every night out of the Town, to guard
sir Frances Veres trenches on the south west part of the Town, who daily
falls out upon the ennemy, with other soldiers of the Town, and have
oftentimes slain many of the ennemies, and wounded more, which have been sent
to Bruges from the Camp, so that their Hospitalles are full of wounded
soldiers, and many Captains, and men of great account, as well Spaniardes,
Italians, and others, have been slain in these conflictes, and amongst the
rest, a Colonel of the Spaniardes was brought to Dunkerke, and there first
buried in his armor, and afterward taken up again, and put into the earth
in a Friars weed, with great solempnitie.

On Sunday, being the six and twentieth day of July last past, was a great
skirmish with the ennemy, which continued very long, and was with great fury,
valor, and resolution maintained on both sides, the ennemy supplying his
soldiers with fresh companies, bringing three, four, and five companies at a
time, and they of the Town seconding their part continually with new
supplies, and with like numbers, so that in the end, it seemed rather a little
battle, than a skirmish, sometime our people being ouermatched with the fresh
companies of their ennemies, were forced to give ground: but presently again,
with their new supplies from the Town, courageously pressed into the thickest
of the enemies, making them likewise to retire into their trenches: and thus it
continued long, sometimes the one part, and sometimes the other giving ground,
until the ennemies horsemen came in, to succor their footmen, whereupon our
men returned into their trenches, and into the Town, after they had slain and
spoiled many of their enemies both horse and foot. But if our men had been
furnished with horsemen, the ennemy had lost many more men than he did, both
in this skirmish, and all others before: but herein, the enemy has had the
vantage of us during this siege, notwithstanding it has been written from
Callice, that after this fight, there were carried out of the Camp to Bruges
three score and ten wagons laden with wounded men, and in every wagon was ten
men at the least: but when they were brought to Bruges, they of the Town
would not receive them, saying that they had their Hospitalles already full,
and could receive no more, and therefore required that they might be conveyed
to some other towns. It was afterward reported, that the ennemy lost in this
shirmish 450. men, besides those that were wounded: neither was this attempt
accomplished, without loss on our side.

Saturday, being the first day of this present month of August, they of the
Town issued again upon the ennemy, and with great fury (after they had
continued skirmish some half hour) forced them to retire to their trenches,
slaying some 80. of their enemies, as near as could be judged: but the
horsemen of the enemy coming in upon our soldiers, they returned into the
Town, with small loss on our part.

It is reported by some that came very lately from Callice, that on wednesday
last, being the fifth day of this present month of August, there was a great
Skirmish begun by those of the Town, to hinder the enemies approach unto the
walls, which was with fierce resolution long continued on both sides, and that
they of the town (with great slaughter of their enemies) had taken three or
five pieces of ordonance, and brought the same into the Town, but how certain
this is (being but a report) I cannot write, the truth thereof will he
hereafter better known.

Sir Frances Vere without the Town does daily fortify his trenches: and the
Governor within the Town, with earth raises the walls, thereby to avoid
the danger of the enemies shot, which his Highness spares not, but bestows
so liberally upon the Town, as if he found shot and powder aboundauntly in the
Downs, or sand-hilles: and withal, laboreth to raise a new Cauallirie, with
bauen and earth, thereon so plant more ordonaunce, and to shoot into the
Town, on the south southwest side. Thus they are earnestly busied on all
sides, the one, nor the other sparing any cost or labor to annoy their enemy,
and to defend themselves, and that thing which to day is not thought upon, is
the next day put in practice, with new devises and warlike stratagems, the one
raising up, the other with his ordonance beating down his ennemies works, that
the same may not be finished, or brought to perfection.

It is also written from Antwerpe, that the Infanta is in person come into the
Camp, and that the Archduke is in Ondenburgh, to the end he may himself in
person give order in these affairs: time will teach us to know what profit
he shall reap by these his travels and inestimable charges.

But at her return from the Camp to Bruges, she brought with her sundry
Companies of Soldiers, but they of the Town denied to receive them, saying
they had no need of any new Garrison, but if it pleased her highness to come
into the Town with her accustomed train, she should be welcome: but as for
her Soldiers, they were not minded to take them into the City.

Such as have come out of Ostend very lately, and likewise from Vlushing,
report for certain, that within the Town of Ostend, there wants not any
thing, fit for the defense thereof, and that all victualles are very
plentiful, English beer is sold for two stiuars the kanne, great measure,
for which there is no excise paid. Sir Frances Vere gives the enemy daily so
much to do, and keeps him so well occupied, that he knows not well which
way to turn him, or what he may well begin to annoy the Town: and it is
thought by many men of good judgment, that he wishes he had not come to
besiege Ostend, seeing he finds so small hope to carry it, but would rather
be with his camp from thence, if he knew how with credit to depart.

Lately the enemy removed nine pieces of his ordonance, from the east to the
weast side: his ordonance made it very dangerous to enter by the accustomed
haven, except it were in the night time, but since the making of the last, or
middle haven, all things are carried in and out without any danger of the
enemies shot. And on the southwest side the ennemy brings great store of
brush and bauen fagots toward the trenches of sir Frances Vere, thinking by
that means so to mount some ordonaunce, that he may beat sir Frances from
his trenches, and so bring his battering pieces nearer unto the walls, or
else, to beat the Town on the south southwest side.

On the south side, the ennemy has raised a mount, from whence he beats the
houses, but specially the Church and Steeple, which is wholly defaced,
otherwise, he does small annoyance to the Town, sometimes with his shot
killing a man: but such as come out of the Town affirm, that for every one
the Town loses, the enemy loses five or six. They of the Town, have
themselves, vntiled and taken down many houses, and also vnpaued the streets,
to shend the same might with the enemies shot, the less annoy them.

The Governor and sir Frances are not idle, but employ all their labor and
industry, both within the Town and without, to raise mounts, and to finish
such other works, as are most behoouefull for the strengthening of the Town
against the enemies forces, and to that end, such soldiers as will work, and
employ their time that way, either by day or night, have xii. d. the day, and
xii. d. the night.

And because the enemy shall the better be kept from approaching the walls,
they of the Town have cut the Sea banckes, so that the Sea water enuironeth
the Town on the south side, from the east to the weast part, in so much that
the town seems to stand in an Island, which threatens great hurt to the land
and country thereabouts, and may (in time) grow very dangerous.

The enemies perceiving them of the town to be very still, and those likewise
of sir Frances Veres trenches to hold them selves more quiet than they had bin
accustomed, sent out a soldier to epsy their doings: one of the soldiers
that came from London spying this stragler, demanded of such as were next him in
the trenches, what he meant thus to approache their trenches: it was answered,
they knew not, except he came as a spy: then quoth the English soldier, I
will go out and talk with him: presently he made toward this stragler, and
making but few words, they sell to blows, and so continued a good space, the
camp on the one side, and the town on the other, beholding them, and noting which
did best: In the end they were both wounded, and so departed: the Englishman
brought with him his enemies hat, and a staff or half pike, which he
valiantly won, and brought into the trenches.

Since the besieging of this Town, the five Galleys of Sluice were at sea, and
(meeting with two ships laden with merchandise, which came from Doit in
Holland, having a ship of war for their conuoy and defense) there began a
hot fight on both sides, and it continued long: the ship of war bestowed
his shot so well, that he did great spoil to the Galleys, and slew many of
their men, but in thend, the Galleys boorded the ship, (and firing her) did,
without mercy, put seauentie six men to the sword, and saved only ten
persons, which, for the most part, are shorn, and made slaves. It was reported,
that this ship of war was, by oversight, set on fire with their own
powder: but by Letters out of Holland, it seems to be otherwise, for it is
writcen from thence, that it pleased God to save one man very myraculously,
who (committing himself to the mercy of God, and of the merciless Seas,
upon a piece of a Maste) rather than he would fall into the hands of his
bloody ennemies: after he had so floated upon the waves of the Sea an hour or
two, he was taken up by an other ship, which (by Gods providence) had spyed
the man thus driving on the water. This man (after his coming into Holland)
made true report hereof, as is above declared.

Within the Town, near unto the west end, they have raised a mount, whereon
is planted twelve cannons, and six demi cannons, wherewith they beat down,
and deface the ennemies works without.

Lastly, such as came on wednesday last out of Ostend, being the fifth day of
this present month of August, (notwithstanding the former report from Callice)
affirm that thenemie has these viii. days layne still, and done nothing, and
affirm, the soldiers of Ostend to be of an invincible courage, not esteeming
any force of the enemy, and that there is no cause of fear, nor want, for all
things are daily in most plentiful sort brought unto them, assuring
themselves, that the ennemy shall (in the end) be forced to depart with shame
and dishonor, and perhaps with greater loss than he now thinks upon, which
God for his mercies sake grant, Amen.

SInce the former Impression of this Pamphlet, we have not heard of any to be
come from Ostend, neither have any Letters been received from Zeland. But from
Callice it is written, by the Post, which came thence with the Antwerpe
Letters, three days past (namely the thirteenth day of this month of August)
that it is generally reported by those that come out of Flaunders to Callice,
that the ennemie begins to wax cold, hopeless in his attempts before
Ostend: and all men which are not partial, judge al his labor lost, and his
excessive charges to be spent in vain. And further, it is said for certain,
that upon friday being the seventh day of this month of August, the wind
blowing a great gale from the northwest, brought such plenty of water upon the
Flemish coast, that the ennemy stood above their knees in water, in some of
their trenches, and that the Sea washing and undermining the foundation of the
last mount, made by the enemy on the south west side of the Town, the same
sunk, and is wholly defaced: at what time they of Ostend issued out, and making
great slaughter of their enemies, brought one piece of ordonance into the
town. But some do report that the enemy lost then five pieces, and that the
rest which lay upon the said Mount (being four pieces more) were, by our
soldiers, so choked and nailed, that in long time the same cannot be made
again serviceable.

Furthermore, on friday last being the foureteenth day of this present month
of August, there arrived here in the Thames, two small Pinckes which came
with fish from Terueare in Walkerland, who report that the twelve hundred men
(of the number of the last two thousand which were pressed, and sent by her
Majesty) are in safety arrived at Vlushing, where they as yet remain, for that
in the town of Ostend they have sufficient forces, as well to defend the Town,
as to guard their trenches without. And also, that the County Maurice was come
into the Haege in Holland, most of his footmen being in Zeland, and his
horsemen at Bergen ap Zome, expecting his coming thither: but, where he meant
to use his forces (as good reason is) was unknown. At their coming from
Terueare, it was generally imagined, that they should be employed in the land
of Waste, which is the most fruitful and fertilest part of all the Province of
Flaunders, and where his Excellency may most endomage the enemy. Time will
manifest the truth, God grant him good success in all his attempts, and to
those of Ostend, courage and magnanimity, valiantly to resist the forces of
their bloodthirsty enemies, Amen.

FINIS.
