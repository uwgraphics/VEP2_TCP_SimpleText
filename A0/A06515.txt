Here after ensues a propre treatise of good works.

The preface.
IT is not unknown to all men (good christen reader) but that the true and
sincere teachers of the infallyble truth of our savior Jesus Christ, ben
falsely defamed unto the unlearned people, and their good name defaced to the,
no little hynderaunce and reproach of the same truth / in yt they (as they be
borne in hand unjustly) should in their wrytynges and sermons, allure and
withdraw the foresaid rude people from penance, from prayer, from fasting,
from watchynge, from pains, from labors / and finally from all good works.
But what they ben and their works also which reprove, sclaunder, calumpnyate,
and falsely impeche the pure, sincere, and true word of god pronounced by the
mouths of those his good and virtuous servants / it is now (thanked be god)
right metely well perceived / ye and for what intent, truly for none other,
tha^ for the mayntenaunce of the god their belyes, their ambycyon, their
symony, their pride, their promocyon, their treason, their treachery, their
glotony, their lecherye, their murdre, with all their vngracyousnes. God
therefore most good and almyghtye of his exceeding and bountefull mercy and
grace, to declare and set forth his infinyte goodness toward his elect, most
well-beloved and faithful servants / that they to their great conforte and
consolacyon, may be proved innocent of this most untrue accusacyon wrongfully
laid unto their charge / and chiefly to the garnysshynge and deckynge of his
emperyall glory, and mayntenau^ce of his vndoubtable truth, has sent the
here (O reder) a right famous and excellent work, wherein is comprehended what
good works be / how we may please god in all our works / and how our
works do not please him, and out of what fou^tayne they ought to spryng and
flow, if they should please his godhede: truly out of the fresshe and living
fountain of an undoubted faith and trust / that his most benygne petye,
swetnes, and gentylnes, which is the father of all mercyes, and the god of all
consolacyon and conforte / does love the, favor the, petye the, accept the.
And thy works also done at his commandment, for the blood, passion,
redempcyon, and satysfaccyon of his most dear and well-beloved sone Jesus Christ
/ in whom, by whom, and for whose sake thou art thus entyerly loved,
favored, and accepted. As wytnessed our father of heaven him self at the
baptysme of our savior Jesus Christ, saying. This is my well-beloved sone, in
whom or for whose sake I am well pleased, that is to say, appeased and swaged
of my wrath, immedyately here him, that is to say, believe, trust him, stycke
and cleave hard to him by faith. For it is he for whom I delight in you, love
you, favor you, petye you, and accept both you and your deeds. This is the
fountain, out of the which all the works of a christen man ought to proceed
/ so that what soever buddeth out of the tree of this faith, is accepted and
pleasant before god / and else it is but sin and not accepted. As saint
Paul writes in the xiiii. chapter to the Romans / what soever (says he)
is not of faith is sin. And in the.xi. chapter to the Hebrews, without
faith it is impossyble for any man to please god. The reason why is this,
albeit thou bestow never so much in alms / fast never so much, pay never so
much, watch never so much / yea albeit thou had done as many good deeds as
all the world. Yet if thou have not the faith before rehersyd / that god for
the blood of his sone does accept the and thy works / love the, favor the,
petye the / yea and that entyerly and as his own son and heir by adopcyon,
all that ever thou doste can not please god / but is abomynable sin and
dyspleasyth him utterly. For how is it possible that thou should please him,
when thou art but a Judas unto him and doste bear two faces in one hoode /
doing one and thinking another. In thy deeds thou woldeste seem to be his
servant, and in thy heart thou do neither love him, nor trust that he
loves the. And albeit he has made never so many and great promyses of
salvation, mercy, love, pety, and favor, in the blod of his sone to all that
repent and doubt not thereof / but assuredly trust unto it, yet thou (what
soever thou art that haste not this faith) like an hethen hounde, and an
vnfaythfaull myscreaunt, by thy infydelyte and false heart do make no better
of him but a liar, and false of his promise / a tyraunte, and a butchers curre
delytyng in blood, and neither doste thou love him, trust him, nor favor him.
For how should thou love him, when thou acco^ptest no better of him than I
have said. And again how is it possible that he should love the, favor the,
petye the, accept other the or thy works, seeing thou doste first abiecte
him by thy synful dyspayre and incredulytie. Yea what worldly prince would keep
such a wretch in his house if he knew him / how much less than would he
love him, favor him, accept him, or any of his service. Against such
works it is that the true and faithful mynysters of Christ's word have
foughten, as done in most false hypocrysye and deuelysshe despair, which
otherwise they have and do hyghely praise and commend, as when they be done in
true faith and love toward god and his commandments, as thou shalt se and
find in this most goodly and excellent volume of good works / which (I
beseech god never to favor me) if any of those untrue men / I will not say,
false deceyuers, did ever write to teach any thing half so good in their
lives. But it is an old proverb that a good thing will praise it self /
wherefore I commytte it unto thine own judgment (good reader) to praise it,
ever as thou shalt find cause / So bold I am of the goodness thereof. And if
thou find my words to be true, that good works be here of our auctor
required, taught, praised, and commended to the uttermost, (as the truth is)
then I beseech the (most gentle and indyfferent reader) to take and admytte
all false back byters and sclaunderers of gods true mynysters evermore
hereafter as they be, and not to think the contrary, but yt as they most
deadely belie those good men in this behalf / so they do also in other
things, as I trust in god it shall more plainly appear / both to the
(gentle reader) and thereto to all the world in time coming. And that as I
believe unfeigned to the great glory of the living god, the inestymable solace
and comfort of his elect children, and the utter confusyon of the children of
Antechrist? So be it.

Here ends the preface of this present work.
dieu et mon droit De bonis operibus.
Here begins the book of good works.
IT is first of all to be known yt there is no good work / but yt which god
has commanded / and again, What sin is.
that there is no sin / but that which he has forbyden and prohibyted.
Therefore he that will know or do good works, needs but the knowledge of
gods commandments. For so says Christ. Math. 16.
Mathewe the xvi. If thou wylt enter into life / keep the commandments. And
also to the young man / that asked him what he should do to be saved. Christ
showed nothing, but the ten commandments. Wherefore it is necessary that we
learn the dyfference of good works, not by the utter show greatness or
multitude of ye works in the^ self / no truly neither after the oppynyon or
judgment of men / neither after the manner of laws, tradycyons, or inuencyons
of man / or by any reason appearing unto our sight, (as we have done
hitherto). For so should it be through our blyndenes, to the great dispysyng of
gods commandments.

THe first and chief and most excellent of all good works, is faith in
Christ. Even as he him self says John^ the.vi. John^. 6.
For to the Jews asking him what they should do to work the works of god.
He answered, this is the work of god / that ye believe in him, whom he has
sent. But we other hearing or preaching this thing / pass over it lyghtlye,
thynkyng it but a tryfle and easy to be done / when notwithstanding we ought
here to make a stay, and faythfullye to remember in our mind. For of this
work and faith must all other good works spring and take their influence of
goodness / and that men may the better perceive this thing / I shall declare it
more grosely. A man shall find many that fast, pray, and do this thing and
that thing, and live a good life, to se to before men? whom if thou do ask /
whether they be sure yt they please god or no, because they do so live. They
will answer that other they know not, or else that they doubt. Moreover there
be some doctors which corrupt and deceive the people / saying it is no need
that they be sure of this thing / and yet they teach us nothing else but good
works. Behold all such works, proceed without faith. For such as is their
conscience and faith toward god / such ben the works that run out of
them. But where as is no faith nor good and a certayned conscience toward god
/ there lacks the head of good works, and all their life and goodness is
nothing worth at all before god. Upon this it comes, The author is falsely
condemned of hypocrytes.
that whiles I praise and make so much of faith / and do cast away (as of
no value before god) the works of such unfaithful / there be some which
blame and accuse me, as though I did forbydde and condemn good works. How
be it in the mean time I desire no thing more vehementlye / than that I
might teach truly the good works of faith.

Moreover if thou ask the^, whether they judge and esteem this for a good
work or no / when they labor their craft with their hands, when they
stand. Go, eat, drink, sleep, and do all other manner of works / other
appertaynynge to the sustentacyon of the body, or necessary for the common
wealth / and whether they believe yt they please god in these things or no. Thou
shalt find some that will say nay / and that will conclude good works in so
little space, and defyne them so straytely / that they will take no thing for
good works / but only prayenge in the temples / fasting, and helpyng the
poor with alms / demynge all other things to be void and vain / and such
as god settyth not by. And so by their da^pnable vnbyleue / they mynysshe,
deceive and abbreuyate gods service and worship, to whom serves / what so
ever is done or can be thought in faith. So teaches the wise man / saying.
Ecclesiastices. 9.
Go therefore and eat thy bread in myrthe, and with joy drink thy wine / for
thy works please god / let thy clothes be white at all times / and let not
thy head lack oil / use gladlye thy life with thy wife, whom thou love in
all ye days of thy life of unstableness, which be given to the all the time of
thy vanyte. Our clothes to be white at all times / is all our works to be
good / what name so ever they be called by indyfferently. But than they be
white, wha^ I am sure they please god. And having this affyrmytie I shall never
lack ye oil of a merry and joyful conscience from the head of my soul / so
said christ. John^ the.viii. chapter. I do always those things which please
him, meaning of the father. John^. 8.
How did he always those things / did he not at all times conuenyent, both
eat, drink and sleep: whereupon saint John^ says By this know we / that we be
of the truth / and will before him put our hertes out of doubt / for if our
heart conde^pne us / god is greater tha^ our heart / and knows all things /
and we have trust toward god / yt what soever we ask of him, we shall have it
/ because we keep his commandments and do those things which be pleasant
before him. To be borne of god, is to believe and trust in god.
Also he that is borne of god, yt is to say / he yt byleueth and trusts in
god, synneth not / another can he sin. Also ye xxxiii. Psalm / all that trust
in ye shall not do amysse. ye in the ii. psalm / blessed be all men yt trust
in him / which sayenges if they be true, what soever they do must needs be
good / or at ye least if they do syn^e, it must be and be forgyuen and
perdoned. Behold here again how greatly I do extolle faith / to yt which I
will refer al good works / but I reiecte what soever is done, yt comes not
from thense.

HEre may every man lightly consydre and perceive / when he does good / and
when he does ill / for if he find his heart instruct with this faith that
he byleueth that he pleases god / than is his work good / ye though it be so
little or so vile, This faith and conscience must be grounded upon the word
of god / which we must have to show for us, that we do nothing but that, yt
is his godly will and pleasure. For with out this word, we can not be sure, what
he would have done or undone, and must therefore consequently stand in despair
of our deeds, whether they ben good or no / which saint Paul calls sin.
as to take up a straw / but if there lack other trust or hope in god / then
the work is naught / ye if he should raise up all dead men / and suffer him
self to be burned / so taught saint Paul saying / that what soever is not of
faith / is sin. For of faith and of none other work / we be ornate by this
name / that we be called chrystyanes / as of the chief work. For as for all
other works / every hethen Jew, turk and syn^er may do them. But to trust
and believe stedfastely that our works please god / is not possible / but to a
chrystyan, illustrate and stablisshed by the grace of god. But such teaching
as this, is very scante. And therefore I am accused to be an heretyke / the
cause whereof is, yt men following blind reason and gentylles doctrine / have
put faith not above, but nyghe unto other virtues / attrybutynge unto it a
peculyer and propre work separated from all other works of other virtues.
Notwithstanding that faith only, does make all other works good, acceptable,
and worthy, in that / that it trusts in god, Ones again remember that this
faith must be builded upon the word of god and forget it no more, for so
means thauctor.
and doubts not / but what so ever a man does / it is well done in the sight
of god: ye they have not suffered faith to remain as a work / but (after
their manner of speaking) have made it a vain qualytie / all though all holy
scripture do attrybute / ye name of godly goodness to faith only and no work
else. Wherefore it is no marvel that they them selfs be made blind and the
leaders of the blind. For as this faith does bring with her charity and
peace, so does she joy and hope / for who so ever byleueth and trusts i^ god
/ to him straight way god gives the holy ghost / witness saint Paul to the
Galatiens saying. Ye have received the spyryte, not by your good works / but
because ye have byleued the word of god.

IN this faith al works be made like and equal / and one as good as another.
In this faith also falls away all dyfference of works, For without faith
it is impossyble to please god, as says Paul ye xi. chapyter to the Hebrews.
whether they be great or little, long or short, many or few / for ye works
be pleasant to god not for them selfs but for faythes sake / which only and
specially and without any dyffere^ce works, quyckeneth, and makes
acceptable, all and synguler works how many and sondrye so ever they be /
none otherwise, than as all the members of a man's body, live, work, and
have their name, by the goodness and virtue of the head. And without ye head,
no membre can live, work, or have the name of a living membre / of the which
thing it follows more largelye / that a chrystyan living in this faith, has
no need of a techer of good works / but to do all thing that comes to his
hand. And all things be well done / as holy Samuel said unto Saul / thou
shalt be changed into another man when the spyryte of ye lord shall come into
the / than do what soever comes to thy hand / god is with the. So read we of
holy Anne Samuels mother / when she byleued Hely the priest, promising her the
favor of god / she went home merry and pacyfyed, neither after that changed
her countenance, that is to say, all things were afterward unto her one and
equal, what soever fortuned unto her. Also saint Paul said, all things be
free there as the spirit of god is / for faith suffers not her self to be
bound to any works / nor again any works, to be taken from her / but even
as it is written in the first Psalm / she gives her fruit in due season /
that is how so ever it comes or chaunseth.

Which thing we may se by a gross and carnal example, after yt a man or
woman has conceived a much special love, and a synguler mind and favor
one of the other, and steadfastly by leueth the same / who shall than teach them
how to behave the^ self one to the other / or what they ought to do to leave
undone, to say / to keep close, or to think? for this only and special
trust / that one has in the other / teaches them al things and more than is
necessary. And than there is no dyfference in works / but either of them
does great works, long works, and many works, as gladly as small works,
short works, or few works. And that with a merry, pacyfyed, and quyete
heart, and utterly of a fre mind / but after yt there is any doubt, than
rise and grow in ye mind diverse ymagynacyons what shall be best to do. And if
it be the man, than he begins to appoint him self with the dyfference of
works, whereby he may obtain favor, and yet even tha^ he comes almost like
a prisoner with a heavy heart, and great trouble, and more than half lost, and
desperate / and often times among these things plays the fool. So a
christen man living in this hope and trust toward god / knows all
things, may do all things / goes about to do all things, and he does all
things merely, and frelye / not to heap and gather together many merytes and
good works / but that it is delight and pleasure to him so to please god well,
and purely and freely to serve god / being content with this only thing that
he pleases god. And of the contrary party, he agrees not / nor is at one
with god by faith / which doubts of him / and which seaketh and busely
cares how he would satisfye and move god by many works / and than he ronneth
to saint James, to Rome, to Iherusalem / hither and thither, this way and that
way / says saint Brigettes prayers / says this and says that / he
fasteth this day and that day / he confesses him here, he confesses him there
/ he asks this man and that man / and yet in all this time he fyndeth no
rest nor quyetenes / doing all these things with great pain, doutfulnes,
indygnacyon and sorrow of his heart / in so much that scripture calls these
good works in the Hebrew tongue / Aueu, Amall. Which we call in our tongue
werynesse and labor. How be it truly they be not good works / but all
lost, void and vain, which ben done in such doubt and dotage. Wherefore
many men otherwhyles have so doted in these / that for sorrow they have fallen
in to many troubles / of whom it is said / we be werye in the way of iniquytie
and perdycyon, Sap. 5.
we have walked hard ways / but the way of the lord we have not known, and
the son of ryghtwysenes has not shyned to us.

Because that faith yet now and then appears in our works right small,
feeble, and weak / let us ask moreover them / that be oppressyd with any
trouble and aduersytie / either of body, or of goods, or of honor, or of
friends, or of any other things that they have / whether yt than they believe,
that they please god / and whether they think, that their trouble and
aduersyties be mercyfully put to them by the very favor of god or no / and
here they will say, that god shows him self wroth and angrye / when
nevertheless even in such vexacyons and trouble a true chrystyan has
steadfast trust / and persuadeth far better things unto him self of god /
that he bears much better good will and favor than appears. For in such
case he is hyd, even as the spouse says in the cantycles? Behold he stands
behind ye wall, and sees me through the creastes / that is to say, in
vexacyons and aduersyties, which are like almost to depart us from him, as a
wall or a bulwark / he stands hid, and yet lokynge upon me he forsakes me
not / for he stands and is redye to help me in grace, sufferynge him self
to be seen by the wyndowes of dark faith. And Hyeremye in the book of Threnes
/ he has loved us after his heart / and has cast down the sons of men /
this faith they know not but think they be forsaken of god, and that god is
enemy to them. Yea and they rather impute such ylles to men and wicked
deuylles / so that they have no trust at all in god. And for this cause, their
troubles and suffrynges even as they be sclaunderous to them / so be they
hurtful. And yet in that while they go forth doing good works after their
own judgment / lokynge nor carynge nothing at all for this true faith. But
to the^ that believe in god / and that in such ylles and troubles have a
steadfast trust that they please god / such ylles and aduersyties be precious
merytes and most noble of all works, Faith makes al things precious.
above all men's estymacyon / for faith and trust to god makes al things
precious, which ylles be dampnable / the which thing is written even of death
/ the.115. psalm / the death of his saints is precious in the syghte of the
lord / for the more better, higher and stronger that the faith and trust is /
so much more the sufferynges in the same faith, pass all works in faith /
And so between works and such passions, there is an inestymable dyffere^ce of
better place co^dycyon and price.

Moreover ye highest degree of faith is when god ponyssheth our conscience not
only with temporal hurtes and persecutyons / The highest degree of faith.
but with death, hell, and sin / and seems in a manner to deny his grace
and mercy, as though he would perpetuallye dampne us / the which thing very
few men perceive / as David co^playneth the.vi. psalm / lord correct me not
in thy angres / for to believe then that we please god / is the chief work
that may be done of or in any creature / of the which these iustytiaryes and
holy workmen and benefactours know nothing at all / He calls them
iustitiaries, which trust of forgyuenesse of their sins and of saluacy on by
their own works and holiness.
for how would they here promise or persuade the goodness and mercy of god to
the^ / when they be uncertain in their works / and doubtful and waueryng,
yea in the least degree of faith. Behold thus have I always spoken and thus
have I always praised faith / and thus have I reiecte al works done without
such faith / to the end yt I might bring men from this false, feigned, shynyng
pharysaycall and unfaithful good works (whereof all Abbeyes, temples, houses,
and al degres and states both high and low be full and replenysshed with) to
most and true good and faithful works even from the ground / in the which
thing no man stryueth or goes against me / but unclean beasts whose feate
be not cloven (as hit is in ye law of Moses) not sufferyng ye dyfference of
good works. But they rousshe out so unadvised that when they have only
prayed, fasted, founded this chauntrye or that / confessed them / and done
satisfactyo^ after their own judgment / they would by and by have all these
doings good / all though in all these things they have no trust of the
lyberalytye or gentylnes of god / but rather they than specially esteem them
for good works / when they have done many / great, and long works / and so
they regard not the grace of god another his pleasure in their works / but put
all their trust in their works / and so build upon the gravel and the water
/ wherefore at the last / they must neades have a great fall. As Christ
says / Mathewe the.vii. chapter / but this good will and pleasure of god the
father toward us upon the which stands our trust / ye aungelles showed from
heaven that night that our lord was borne / syngyng praise be to god above /
peace in the yerthe / and to men good will.

Behold now this is ye work of the first commandment / whereby it is
commanded that thou should have no strange god / which is asmoch to say as
thus. For asmoche as I am only god / thou ought to put all thy trust,
hope, and faith, in me and none else / for it is not to have one god / if thou
name him with thy mouth outwardelye, or worship him with knelynge, or other
such gestures / but if thou trust in him ^^th heart and mind promysyng to
thy self all goodness, grace, and good will of him / as well in persecucyon and
aduersytie / as in prosperyte / no less in death than in life / as well in
bitter and hard things / as in pleasant and easy / like as our lord Christ
/ said to the woman of Samarytan / god is a spirit / and they which worship
him / must worship him in spyryte and truth. And this trust, hope, and
faith of ye heart / is the true full living of the first commandment
without the which, there is no work at all that may satysfye this
commandment / and like as this commandment is chief / highest and best of
all other / and out of the which all other come / in the which all things
proceed / and after ye which, all things must be ordered and reweled / so
this work / that is to say, hope and trust in the grace of god, is chyef /
highest and best of all other works / out of ye which all other grow and
come forth / be orderyd and governed. All other works therefore compared to
this work / stand (without the fulfyllyng of ye first commandment) as
nothing worth / and as though there were no god. S. Augustyne.
wherefore saint Augustyne said excellentlye / that the works of the first
commandment, be / to believe, trust, and love. Moreover we said before that
such faith and trust, bryngen with them charity and hope / ye and if thou
wylt well consydre the matter / charity is first at the least equal with
faith / For I can not trust in god / oneles I think that he is gentle /
merciful, meke, and kind to me / whereby I am moved to love him again, and to
trust to him with all my mind utterly determined with my self that he will do
all things for the best to me.

Now thou see that all they, which believe not always in god, and promise
not to the^ selfs the grace, favor, and good will of him, in all their
works and vexacycyons, life, or death / but seek it about other things or
else in them selfs / keep not this commandment of god / but truly use
ydolatrye / ye though they did the works of all the other commandments / ye
in so much if they had cast in one heap together / the prayers, fastings,
obedyence, sufferaunce, chastyte, and innosencye of all saints / for there is
not the pryncypall and head work / without the which all other works be
nothnyge at all / but fair shynynge outward shows, and colors / of ye
which our lord has warned us before. Mathewe the.vii. chapter / beware of
false prophets which come to you in shepes clothing / wtin they be rauysshyng
wolves / of the which sort be they / which go about to get ye favor of
god (as they speak) with many good works and him their frynde, as though
they should bye his grace and favor / as though god were a broker, seller,
and a merchaunte / which would not freely give his grace in good will. These
ben ye most frowardes of all the men in the world / And which either hardely
or else never be converted to the true way. Likewise be those which in their
trouble and aduersitye, run hither and thither up and down / sekyng
counsel, help and conforte, and let god alone / of whom oonly they be
commanded to seek such things / whom the prophet Esaye rebukes after this
manner. My people is folysshe / and has not turned again to him that stroke
him / that is to say, the lord has stryken them, and send to them all
manner of trouble vexacyons, and aduersytie that they might run to him and
trust to him / but they ro^ne from him to men now in to Egypt, now in to
Assiria / ye and sometime to ill deuylles / of the which Idolatrye, there be
many things read, both in the same prophet Esaye / and also in the book of
kings / and so do now a days all our holy Ipocrytes / that when they be
troubled with any aduersytie / they ro^ne not to god but fly from him /
thinking this oonlye / that they may be delivered out of this trouble either
by them self, or else by man's help / and yet in all these things not
oonlye judging them self good, but sufferynge all other so to repute and
judge them.

THis is the mind of saint Paul in many places, where he attrybuteth so much
to faith. A right wise man lives by his faith / for faith is the self same
thing / for ye which a man is counted ryghtwyse before god / therefore if
ryghtwysenes be in faith / it is clear ye the same faith only fulfylleth
all the commandments of god, and makes ryghtwyse all their works / in as
much as no man is ryghtwyse / but if he fulfill all the commandments of god
/ and again works without faith iustyfye no man. And therefore saint Paul
with a full mouth rejects works / and so greatly commends and prayseth
faith that many being offended with his words said, than let us do no good
works. But saint Paul rebukes them / as erronyous and folysshe, and so it
is now a days / that when we reiecte these great and shynynge works done now
a days with out faith / they say than we must only believe and do no good /
for now they call the works of the first commandment to sing / to read, to
play on the organce / to say service or to celebrate / to say mattens,
euensong, or other canonycalle hours / to found churches, alters,
monasteryes, and to honor them and heap them up with belles, vestementes and
such other treasure, to god, to Rome and other saints upon pilgrimage.
Moreover to were this garment or that knelyng of their knees / saying the
Rosary or psalter of our Lady doing al these not before an ydole. But before
the holy cross of god / the images of saints / and this they call the
worshyppyng and prayenge to god / which things both vserers / adulterers /
and all manner of sinners do and may do daily. Now where as these be done with
such a faith that we believe that they please god, thanne they be praised, not
for their own virtue, but for the faith sake, for the which all manner works
(as is said before) be equalle. But if we either doubt, or judge god not to
be gentle, or merciful unto us, or not to please god, or if we presume to
please god, by or after these works, than be they nothing / but very gyles,
dyssymulacyons, and dysceytes outewardlye to worship god, and inwardelye to
put him for an Idol. This therefore is the cause / why I have so often spoken
and cast away such works, pompes, bostynges, and multytudes of them / And
because it is open and manyfeste / that such works be done, not only in
doubt, and without such faith / but also among a thousand men there is
scante one that puts not all his trust in them / thinking surely that so
he shall obtain the grace / or favor of god / And that he shall prevent his
grace / and so to make merchau^dyse with god, the which thing god can not
suffer / which has promised his faith freely / he would that we should begin
at his grace / through faith / and in the same to fynysshe all our works, what
so ever they be / and by what name so ever they be called.

OF these thou thy self perceyueste, how greatly these two differ / to fulfill
the first commandment with outward works / and withinwarde faith / for the
one makes us the true living sons of god / the other makes the worste
ydolatrye and most hurtefull hypocrytes of the world / bringing many men in
to ye ways by the great shynynge, and yet sufferyng them to remain with out
faith / and so wretchedlye deceive the^ styckyng in the outward voice and
apparau^ce / of whom Christ speaks. Mathewe.xxiiii. Than if any man shall
say unto you: lo here is Christ or there is Christ believe it not. Also in
John^ the.iiii. chapter / woman trust me ye hour comes when ye shall
neither in this mountain, nor yet at Iherusalem worship the father / but the
hour comes, and now is / when ye true worshyppers, shall worship the Father
in spyryte and veryte / for verylye such the Father requires to worship him.
These and such other saints as they have moved me / so they ought to move
all other to cast away this great pomp with Bulls, sealles, baners, and
pardons / wherewith the miserable people be moved to build temples, to give and
found abbayes, and such like, and in ye mean time faith is suppressed and
put to syle^ce, yea rather utterly oppressed But where faith has no
dyffecence bytwyxte works, there is no work pompous and proud better one
tha^ another after her. And of a truth it is, ye faith only will be ye true
worship and service of god, not suffryng any such name or praise to be given to
one work or other / but as far forth as she does vouchesalfe / which thing /
she than does / when the work is done in and of her. But this ill was fygured
in the old testament / when the Jews forsook to offer in the temple, and
offered in other places / as in wodes and in hills / even so do they, which be
busye and ready to do all things, and never do this head work of faith.

WHere be they now which ask what be good works, what they ought to do, or
how they might be good? ye where be they which say that we so preche faith
that we teach no good works, and that there ought none to be done? Does not
this first commandment make us more busynes / than any man can fulfill? For
if one man were a thousand me^ / ye all men or all creatures / yet here he had
enough to do / and more than he might away with, whiles he is commanded to
live and continue always in faith / and trust to god / and to put trust in no
other / and so to have one true god / seeing than that man's life, can not be
one moment without deed, fault, trouble, or flyghte / for the life of man as we se
never rests / let him yt would be good and full of good works begin to be
always in this faith, let him learn often time to do and leave undone all
things in such trust / for so shall he find how great busynes he has to
do / and how all things stand in faith / and that faith can not be ydell /
and that ye self same ydelnes is sometime the exercise and work of faith. And
to be short / there is nothing yt can perysshe or lose to us that believe yt
all our works please god / for tha^ they can not be / out good and merytoryous
/ so says saint Paul / 1. Corin. 10.
whyther therefore ye eat or drink / or what soever you do / do all to the
praise of god / it can not be done in ye same name / but if it be done in the
same faith / Also to the Romans / for we know well that all things work
for the best to them that love god. Therefore the saying of them that say that
we forbyde good works and preach only faith / is like as I should say to a
sick man / if thou had health / thou should have all ye works of thy
members without the which / the works of ye me^bres be nothing / of this he
might understand. That I forbid the works of the members / when my meaning
is that he must have health, and than work all the works of all his members
/ so faith must be the chief craftesman buylder and capytayne in all works /
or else the works be utterly naught.

But if thou say / why have we than so many Laws, both spyrytuall and
temporal, so many cerymonyes of churches, monasteryes, and abbeys, to move
cause and provoke men to good works / if faith do all things after the first
commandment? I answer for no cause, but that we al another have nor set by
this faith / for if we all had this faith / we neded no laws / but every
one of us should do always good works as the same faith do teach him. There
be four manner of men / the first now named, which neade no law, of whom
says saint Paul.i. Timoth.i. The law is not given to a ryghtwyse man / ye
is, to a faithful man. For such manner of men, do all what so ever they know
or may, with a free mind, regardyng this only with a sure and stable faith,
that the grace and benevolence of god helps them in all things. The second
sort or kind of me^ ben they / which will mysse use this liberty / and
falsely styckynge and being bold of it wax slow / of ye which, speaks
saint Peter in his first epistle, the.ii. chapter / saying for so is ye will
of god / that with well doing / ye should stop the mouths of al ingnorau^t
me^ / as fre, and not as though you took liberty for a cloak of malicyousnes
/ but even as the servants of god / as though he should say / liberty of
faith gives no license to sin, another cloketh it / but gives power to do
all manner of works / and to suffer all things / how soever they come to
hand / so yt no man is bound peculyerly to one work, or to some works. As
saint Paul says to ye Galatianes ye first chapter. Brethren ye were
called into liberty / only let not your liberty be an occasyon unto the
flesh / but in love serve one another / these men therefore must be compelled
by laws and kept with doctrynes and warnynges. The third sort be wicked men
/ ever redye to sin and vice / which must be compelled both with spyrytual
and temporal laws / even like wild horses and dogs / and if they amend
not / let them be punysshed with extreme ponysshement by the te^porall sword,
as saint Paul says to the Romans the.xiii. chapter / for rulers are not
to be feared of good doers / but of ill / will thou be without fear / of the
power? Do well than / and so shall thou be praised of the same. For he is the
mynyster of god for thy welthe / but if thou do ill / thou fear / for he
bears not the sword for naught / for he is the mynyster of god, to take
vengeance of them that do ill. The fourth kind of men be they / which be yet
wyld, weak, and children in the understanding of faith and spyrytuall life /
which must neades be intysyd and tyckled as chylderne with outward words and
cerymonyes, with adournyng the churches with organnes / and what soever is done
in the temple / with prayer, fasting, and what soever is used, other in the
temples, or abbeys / unto they learn to know faith / how be it here is a
great fault / that rulers and officers (alas for sorrow) be so accustomed and
weryed in these cerymonyes and outward works, and faith let alone, which
they ought to have always to teach above these works, like as the mother
gives ye child with milk, other meat, until the child it self may eat
stronger meat by it self.

But for as much as we be not al equal and like / such manner of men must be
forborne and suffered / and we must observe and bear those things / which
they observe and bear / and not despise them / but teach them the true way
of faith / as teaches saint Paul to the Romans / xiiii. chapitre / him
that is weak in the faith / receive unto you and learn him / the which thing
he did him self / the first epistle to the Corinthyanes the.ix. chapter.
And unto the Jews (says he) I became as a Jew, to win the Jews, to them
ye were under the law / was I made as though I had been under the law, to win them that were under ye law. And Christ in Mathewe the.xvii. chapter
/ when he should pay trybute / which he ought not to do / reasoned with Peter
saying / of whom do kings of ye earth take trybute or poole money? of their
chylderne or of strangers? Peter said unto him of strangers / than said
Ihesus unto him again, than are the children fre / nevertheless least we
should offend them / go to the sea / and cast in thy angle / and take the
fysshe / which first comes up / and when thou openeste his mouth / thou
shalt find a peace of twelfe pens, that take / and pay for the and me / here
we se that as all works / so all things be free to a christen man through
his faith, and yet he does suffer and observe with the faithful that / that
he is not bound to do. And that he does upon his liberty, being free, and
nothing doubting, that he so does please god / and he does it gladly /
taking it frelye as any other work that comes to his hand, without his
own chosyng or purpose, and here he does only desire and requires nothing
else but that he may so work to please god with his faith. But in as much as
we purposed to teach in this book which be very true good works, and we now
speak of ye highest work of all / it is manifest ye we speak not of ye
second, third, or fourth sort of men / but of the first, to whom all
the other must be like in conclusyon, and in the mean while, be taught, and
suffered of the first. And so such men of weak faith / ready always to do
good and to learn better / and yet not able to perceive and understand all
things, be not to be despised i^ their cerymonyes. Blame therefore their
folysshe blind teachers, which never taught them faith, but have drawn
the^ so deaplye in to works, That is to wit from that confydence yt they
may be saved by their works / for else they make a god and sauyoure of their
works, whch is high ydolatrye, and utterly concludes that the blod of christ
is shed in vain, for if our works can save us what neded christ to dye and
this is thautors meaning when so ever he says fran works.
therefore they must be gentlye brought up by a little and little fro works
to faith / as men do handell a sick man / and they must be suffered to lean
to some works a while, for their own conscience until they embrace faith a
right / lest whiles we go about cruelly and sharply to pluck them from their
works, their conscience be confounded or troubled, and err and waver about
uncertain / and so they another keep faith nor works. But styffe necked men,
holding styffelye in their works / not regarding what is spoken of faith /
ye in so much they strive against it / must be let alone / that the blind
may lead the blind / as Christ both taught and did.

But peradventure thou will say, how should I think for a suertye yt al my
works please god, otherwhyles speaking, eating, drinking, and slepynge to
much, or in any other way swaruynge from ye right, the which is impossible
for me to exchue? I answer, that this questyon proves / yt thou yet take
faith no other ways than thou doste other works, another doste thou esteem it
above all other works / for no other cause is faith ye chief work, but for
because it remains and quenches these venyall and daily sins, because she
byleueth yt god favors the, and imputes not such daily falls and fautes,
ye moreover if the fall be dedely / which thing happens seldom or never to
them ye live in faith toward god / yet faith ryseth again, and doubts
not but yt by and by all his sins shall be weared away, as it is in the
first epistle of John^ the.ii. chapter. My little children these things write
I unto you, that you should not sin, and if any man sin: yet we have an
advocate with the father, Ihesus Christ, which is ryghtwyse / and he it is
that obtayneth grace for our sins / not for ours only, but also for all the
sins of all the world. And the wise man the.xv. chapter. If we do sin we
be thine knowing thy greatness. And the.xxiiii. chapter of ye proverbs seven
times in a day the ryghtwyse man falls and ryseth again / ye this faith and
trust must be so high and strong that a man may know that all his life
and deed is no other thing but da^pnable sins in the judgment of god as it
is written ye 142. psalm / there shall no living man be iustyfyed in thy syghte
/ but we should rather so dyspayre in our works / that we should believe that
they can not be good / but by this faith thinking yt we shall have no
judgment of god, but pure grace, favor, good will, gentylnes, and mercy /
as it is in the.xxv. Psalm / thy mercy is before my eyes / and I have delyted
in thy truth: and in the.iiii. psalm. Thy light is marked upon our face (that
is ye knowledge of thy grace by faith) and by ye thou have given mirth in my
heart / for as thou byleuest and trusts, so shall come unto the. Lo thus by
the mercy and grace of god, and not by their own nature, these vain and
void works be without sin / and so by faith: labourynge with the same mercy
they be good / And so for our works we may be a frayed / but for the mercy of
god we may be comforted / as it is written, in the.146. psalm / the lord
delyteth in them that fear him / and in them that trust to his mercy / so we
pray with full trust our father which is in heaven, We be sinners as concerning
our works and our own life, but in respect of christ's works, his
satysfaccyon and blood we be just and no sinners, for because we clean whooly
to him by faith, for the which we be accepted as no sinners.
nevertheless to forgive us our sins. We be his sons, nevertheless
sinners. We be acceptable, and yet have not made satysfaccyon. But faith
confyrmed and stablysshed in the trust of god shall do all these things.

But if thou ask where faith and trust may be found, and from whense they
come truly, that is most necessary to be known. First of all without doubt:
they come not of thy works or deservings, but only, frelye, by ye gift and
promise of Ihesus christ, as Paul writes to the. Rom^. the.v. chapyter. Here
may thou fern of saint paul from whens faith does spri^g, and why thou
may committee the wholly unto Christ, and doubt nothing i^ him, albeit thy
sins be never so great.
God, sets out his love that he had toward us / seeing that while we were
sinners / Christ dyed for us / as though he should say / shall not this thing
cause us to have a strong and vnouerco^med faith that chyrst is dead for our
sins before we asked it / and for the which we yet cared not, ye even than,
when we were contynuynge in sin / where after it follows. Much more than
now (seeing we be iustyfyed in his blood) we shall be preserved from wrath
through him / for if when we were enemies, we were reco^syled to god by ye
death of his sone. Much more seeing we be reco^syled / we shall be preserved
by his life / lo how thou ought to ymagen christ in ye, and how god has
set forth and showed his mercy to ye in him. Without all thy deservings going
before that out of ye same image of his grace / thou should draw both faith
and trust of forgyuenes of al sins: wherefore faith begins not of works
another is it made by works / for faith is a work that ronneth and flows out
of the blood, Faith.
wounds, and death of Christ. In the which thing when thou see god so
merciful unto the / that he would give his sone for the, thy heart must neades
wexe sweet / and so thou must neades love him again and so does spryng the
trust of ye mere grace of god toward the / and of his good will, and again of
thine toward him / for we never read that the holy ghost was given to any
man for workynge, but always to them, that here the gospel and mercy of
Christ and believe it, out of the which word and none other thing at this
day should faith come forth / for Christ is the rock, out of the which as
Moses says / Deuteronomi. 3.2. butter and honey be sucked.

The second commandment.
LO hitherto we have entreated of the first commandment / and that shortly,
grosely, and in such have / yt there may many mo things be spoken of them.
Now therefore by the commandments ye follow, we shall more largely seek
these works. Therefore the second and next work unto faith, is the work of
the second commandment, that we should honor the name of god, and not use it
in vain / the which no more than all other works can be done without faith.
For if it be done without faith it is utter lie naught, but Ipocrysye, and an
outward show. Next unto faith we cannot do a greatter thing, than laud, set
forth, sing, and by all manner of ways extol, and magnyfye, The aucthor said
before, yt there is no dyfference in works, which he here declares more
largely, and says nothing but ye truth and therefore mysreporte him not, as
many have done to ye co^de^nacyon of their own conscience.
the laud, honor, and name of god / And though I said before (as it is true)
that there is no dyfference in works, where faith is, and works, yet yt is
to be understand when the works be compared to faith / but comparynge work
to work, they have dyfference, and one is higher than an other, for as the
me^bres of the body, as perteynynge to health, have no dyfference, and health
works as well in one as in another, and yet nevertheless the works of the
members be diverse and sundry / and one higher nobler and more profitable than
another / even so here / to praise the name and glory of god / is better than
the works, of other commandments, and yet it must no less than all other
good works proceed, and be done, in the same faith. He means that it must
be done with such a sure faith yt we believe undoubtedly yt god is therewith
all utterly well pleased, and that he unfeignedly enbraseth both us and our
works, for ye merytes of christ's blood, wherein and wherefore we make us so
assured.
But I know that this work is little made of / yea it is all utterly unknown
/ therefore let us look upon it more dylygently, content to have said, that
this work ought be done in faith, and trust, if it shall please god / ye
forsothe there is no work / in the which thou shalt more euydentlye, or
myghtelye perceive the vehemence of trust and faith, than in the worshyppynge
of gods name. And it is a wonderful help, both to then creasyng and
stablysshynge of faith, how be it all good works profit to that purpose. As
says saint Peter in his.ii. epistle, the first chapter. Wherefore brethren
give ye more dylygence to make your calling and eleccyon sure by gods
works.

AS the first commandment forbyddeth us to have strange gods / so it
commands us to worship the self same one and true god by faith / trust,
good will, hope, and charity / which only be the works, wherewith we may
have, worship, and serve god. For god can be another obtained nor lost by any
work, but only be faith or vnbyleue / by trust or desperacyon. For there is
no other work that touches god / and so is forbyde in this second work, yt
we take not the name of god in vain / The which yet is not enough / but here
is also commanded / that we worship / call upon / preach and praise his
name. And truly it is not possible / but yt the name of god must needs be
irreuere^tly taken, where it is not reverently worshypped. For all though it
be honored with the mouth / with knealynge, with kissing, or with such
other gestures / yet if it be not from the heart by faith and trust in god,
it is nothing / but an outward show and color of ypocrysye and
dyssymulacyon. Now take heed how many good works a man may do at all times
in this commandment, and never to be without ye good works of this
commandment, if he will, so that suerly he neadeth not to go far of
Pilgrimage / or vysyte holy places. And that to make more plain, show what
momente or time, may so soon pass over / in the which without any
interrupcyon / we either receive not goodness of god / or else suffer ill
aduersytyes / and what other things be the benefytes of god, or aduersyties /
but contynuall warnynges and prouocacyons / to laud, worship, and praise god /
and to call upon him and his name / and so albeit thou be clean without all
business / haste thou not yet enough to do, in this commandment, to bliss,
praise, laud, and worship god? for unto what other purpose be ye tongue, voice,
sound, and mouth made? as it is in ye psalm / lord open my lyppes / and my
mouth shall show forth thy praise / Also my lyppes shall praise the. What
work is there in heaven / but of this second commandment, as it is red in
the.8.4. psalm. Lord blyssed be they that dwell in thy house, for they shall
praise the for ever. So David in the.33. plalme. his praise is always in my
mouth / and saint Paul to the Coryntheans / the first Epistle the.10.
chapyter / whyther therefore ye eat or drink, or what soever you do, do all to
the praise of god / Also to the Collossyans the.3. chapter. and all things,
what soever you do in word, or dead, do in ye name of the lord Ihesus
Christ, gyuyng thanks to god the father by him. So that and if we kept this
work, we should here in earth, have ye kingdom of heaven, and we should have
enough and enoughe to do, as have the blessed in heaven.

FRom hence comes the meruaylous and right judgment of god, ye other whiles
the nedy and poor man, whom no man regards / has many and great works
with him / and at home at his house by him self, be other prayseth god merelye
in his prosperyte / or else calls upon him in aduersytie / and in that,
doing a greatter and more acceptable work / than another that fasteth much,
prays, buyldeth churches, goes pylgrymages, and weryeth him self hither and
thither with many works. And so hence it comes to this fool, that he gapeth
and ganeth for such great works, so utterly blind, that he never observes
the other most excellent work of the poor man / so that to praise god is but
a little work in his eyes, in comparyson of these great images, ymagened by
his own works, in the which peradventure he prayseth him self more than god
/ or at ye least takes more pleasure in them than in god. And so by his good
works he resysteth the second commandment of god and his works. The
publycane, and the Pharysie, that be in the gospel ben a figure of all these.
Where the sinner calls upon god in his sins, and preaseth him, touching
the two high commandments, faith, and the honor of god, but the Pharysye
accustomed to neither of these bosteth him self in other good works, by the
which he rejoices not in god, but in him self, trusting more in himself,
than in god. Wherefore the one was worthelye reiecte, and the other chosen of
god, ye which thing makes all to this point, that the higher and better, that
the works seem, so much less they stablysshe a man's faith. And to these
every man presumes, that he may easily do these works, for we se that no man
seems so much to praise the name and glory of god, as they which never do
it. So that when souer the heart is without faith, it causes the precyousnesse
of the work to be despised. yea saint Paul doubts not to say plainly that
they did cheyflye blaspheme the name of god, which bosted them self of ye
law of god. For it is but an easy thing to name / the name of god, or to
paynte his honor in paper or cloth, or upon a wall / but to praise him from
the heart / to thank him in his good gifts, and boldly to call upon him in
his aduersyties, These trewelye be very selde, and the cheyfe of all works
next to faith. In so much, that if we might se how few there be of these
in Chrystendome, we might dye for sorrow. And yet in the mean time, these
high, fair, and shynynge works inverted by man, be ever increased, which i^
deed outwardlye be like unto these true works, but within and in the ground,
they be without all faith and trust and have no goodness in them at all. So the
prophet Esaye the.4.7. chapter rebuked the people of Israel. Ye that be of
the house of Iacobe yt be called Israel and have come out of the stock of
Judah, which do swear in the name of the lord and god of Israel / ye remember
him another in veryte nor in truth / yt is to say, they did these things
another in faith nor trust, which is the true veryte and ryghtwysenes / but
they trusted i^ their own self, in their own works, and in their own
power, and yet they called upon the name of god and praised it outwardelye, the
which things do agree to many now a days.

Wherefore ye first work of this commandment, is to laud god for his
benefytes which be excedynglye many, in so much that there ought to be no
ceasynge or end of such laud or gyuyng of thanks. For who can praise him
enough, for this natural life, albeit I let pass over all the temporal and
everlasting goodness that we may receive of him? Thus is man over whelmed and
heaped with good works, by the only beginning of this commandment, which
if he use with true faith he shall not be here Idle / Again this precept
offend no men more than they that seem holy, that stand in their own
conceyte, yt gladly Augustyne says, that all other vices be done in ill
works, except desire of honor and pleasure, which is done in and of good
works, wherefore if a man have no other thing to do, but the second work of
this commandment yet he has busynes and labor all his life to strive
against this vice, it is so subtle, obstynate, importunate, and stryuynge
against him that would cast it out. But now all these good works set a part,
we excercyse our self in other vyler works, ye rather we subuerte and forget
these right works, by other works only good by our own judgment. And so the
holy name of god is take in vain and irreverently counted, through our
cursed name / pleasure, and desire of honor, which only is to be honored,
and worshypped, ye which sin is more grievous in the sight of god, than other
ma^slaughter or adulterye, but his poison is not so clerelye seen, as be
adulterye and manslaughter / for the hyghnes of it, for it is not committed in
ye gross flesh, but in ye spyryte.

THere be some that think it profitable for youth to exhort and move them
to do well and live well, by praysynge, honor, and laud, again to dyswade
him from ill, by shame, and sclaunder. For there be many that do good for love
of honor, and of praise, and leave ill, for fear of sclau^der / or else they
would another do the goodness, nor leave ye ill undone / whom I leave to their
own judgment. But we do search how good works, should truly be done / to
the which thing who soever be ready they need not to be moved, other by fear
of shame, or desire of honor / but they have and ought to have a more nobler
mocyon, that is, the commandments of god / the pleasure of god, and their
faith and love toward god. They that have not this mocyon nor care not for it
/ sufferynge them self to be moved, by honor, or laud, receive their
reward here. As Mathewe says the.vi. chapter. And such as is the mocyon /
such be the work and the reward, and neither of them good but in the syghte
of the world. I would judge it as easy to use and move a young man, by the
fear and commandments of god, and nothing else, but wha^ this profyteth not
/ we must neades suffer them to good for praise, and leave ill for sclaunder
/ as we be bound to suffer ill and vnperfytte men / of whom I speak before.
There is nothing that we should do more in this / but that we say unto them
/ how that their dead is not suffycyent or right in the sight of god / so
sufferynge them to their own manners, till they may learn to do well for god
/ as children be provoked by gifts and promyses of their fathers and mothers
to fast, to pray, and to learn, the which is not good to do, thoroughe all
their life, and never to learn to do well for the fear of god, much more
worse than is it, if they be used to do well for praise or honor.

YEt nevertheless it is sitting that we have good name and praise / therefore
let every man so show him self, that there can no ill be spoken of him,
another that any man be offended in him. As saint Paul says to the Romans,
ye.xii. chapyter prouydyng good things, not only before god, but before al
men. And to the Corynthians the.ii. epistle, and the iiii. chapter. We report
our self to every man's conscience in the sight of god. But here is need
both of great delygence and wisdom, lest that such honor and good name,
should make us proud, and cause us to have love and pleasure in them. For here
proceeds the saying of Solomon: as fire does prove gold in the fournace /
so a man is proved with ye mouth of him that prayseth him. Therefore there ca^
be but few so high and spyrytuall men, which co^tynewe fre, and up right in
such praise and honor, setting not by them, nor having any pleasure in them /
but wholly abydyng fre and void from all spyrytuall pride / ascribing all
their honor and name to god only, referryng to him, what soever excelle^ce
they have / another vsyng them otherwise than to the glory of god and the
profit of their neighbors, and to nothing less, than to their own pryuate
welthe and prerogatyue / so that they presume nothing of their honor another be
proud of it, but can live as the most vylest and fylthestes of ye world But
let the^ knowledge the^ selfs to be ye servants of god / ye gyuer of such
honor, to serve god and their neighbor, none otherwise tha^ if he had
committed certain of gold to the^ to be distrybuted to ye poor people i^ his
name. So he says Mathewe ye.v. chap. So let your light shine before men yt
they may se your good works and praise your father which is i^ heaven / he
said not yt they might praise you but your works and yet yt they might serve
to a more better profit yt by the^ they may praise god both in you and in
the^. For this is ye true use of good name and honor, when god is praised by
them to ye profit of other men. But such men as would praise us / and not god
in us and our deeds / let us not suffer in any wise, but forbydde and fly such
praise with all our might and strength / as the most grievous of all sins and
robberye of the honor of god.

HEnce it comes, that many times by the sufferaunce of god, a man falls in
to grievous sins / and lies wrapped in them, in so much that he appears a
grievous sinner as well in his own syghte, as before other men, or else he could
never be saved, for the stop and let of this exceeding vice of vain
glory, if he should never fall, but contynewe in great gifts and virtues. For
god must withstand this sin, with other great sins / that his holy name
may abide in honor. So one sin is remedy and a medecyne for another /
because of our froward malycious nature not only doing all ill, but also
abusing all goodness. Now mark how great busynes he has, that will do good
works which come to his hands by great heaps / with the which when he is
compassed about on every side, and has enough commanded him to do / yet (alas
for sorrow) he seaketh and follows other after his own mind and will, and
lets them lie undone / so yt no man can speak enough against this ill /
another exchue it enough. With this sin had the prophets much to do / and
were slain / Chosen works of man's own fantasye ben forbidden.
for because they rejected and dampened such chosen works, invented and taken
up by man's own mind / prechynge only the commandments of god / of the
which works speaks Hyeremie the.vii. chapter / these things says ye lord
of hoostes of Israel / put your sacryfyce to your offrynges, and eat the
flesh / for I speak not with your fathers / another commanded them one word
of sacryfyce and offrynges / that day that I brought them out of the land of
Egypt / but this word I commanded them, saying. Here ye my voice, and I
shall be unto you a god / and you shall be unto me a people, that is to say /
here ye not that, which seems right and just to you / but that which I have
commanded you / and walk you in all the way, which I so bydde you / yt you
may do well. And the.xii. chapter of Deuteronomye / do only to the lord, yt
which I command the, do thou another put to, nor take away any thing. These
and innumerable such sentences of scripture be spoken to pluck a man / not
only from sin, but also from the good and just works of their own opinion
/ and only to bring them by this plain sentence to gods commandments /
that they may greatly regard, and keep them only. As it is said, Exodi
the.xiii. chapter. It shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as a remembrance
before thy eyes / yt the law of god may be always i^ thy mouth. And in the
first psalm / he shall muse in his law day and night / for we have busynes
enough and more than enough, to fulfill the commandments of god. For he
has given us such commandments, yt if we did understand them / we should
not truly be ydell, the twynkelyng of an eye / and lightly forget all other
works. But the ill spyryte which rests not until he pulle us on the lift
hand, into ill works / looks ryghtly unto these chosen and shynynge works /
against the which god commands, Deuteronomie the.xxvii. and Iosue
the.xxiii. chapter. Be ye only strong and busy, that you may keep all things
that be written in the book of Moses law, and do you not bow from it, another
on the right hand, nor on the lift hand.

The third work of ye second commau^deme^t.
THe third work of this commandment, is to call upon the name of god in all
trybulacyo^s / for by this god judges his name to be hallowed, magnyfyed, and
worshypped / if we name him, and call upon him in persecucyon and necessytie.
And for to be short, this is the very cause why he does not only punysshe us
with so many necessyties, suffrynges, persecucyons, ye and death / but also
suffers us to live in many ill and sinful affeccyons / that by them he may
move man to run to him / to cry to him, and to call upon his holy name / and
so to fulfill the work of the second commandment, as he said the 4.9.
psalm. Call upon me in the day of thy trouble / And I shall deliver the, and
thou shalt honor me. Offer to god the sacryfyce of praise, and thou shall
honor me. And this is the way, whereby thou may come to health. For by this
work a man may perceive and prove what the name of god is, how mighty and
full of power it is, to help the^ that call upon it / by the which spryngeth
meruaylouslye trust and faith / whereby the chief and first commandment is
fulfilled / the which thing Dauyd had proved when he said the.53. psalm. I
shall wyllyngly offer to the / and I shall praise thy name, for it is good. For
thou haste delivered me from all trouble / and my eye has looked over all my
enemies. And in the.90. psalm god says Because he has trusted in me, I
shall deliver him, and I will defend him / because he has known my name.
Now therefore mark, what man there is in the world / that has not busynes
enough all his life / in this one work / for who lacks temptacyon, ye the
space of one hour? Albeit in the mean time I pass over, and speak in thing
of the temptacyon of troubles, which be infynyte. To this add that the most
peryllous temptacyon of all is this, when there is no temptacyo^, nor trouble,
but that al thing gothe after a man's mind lest that he forgette god, and
be the more cruel and mysuse this prosperyte and fortunable seaso^s. yea here
has he ten times more neaed to call upon ye name of god than in aduersytye, as
it is red the.90. psalm there shall fall a thousand upon thy right hand.
Moreover we se clerer than the day, by daily experyence of men, that there be
more grievous vices and sins committed in peace / in welthe of goods, and in
prosperous time, Co^tynuall prosperyte is most dangerous.
than in war, pestylence, syckenes, and in all manner of troublous. In somoch
that Moses feared that his people should forsake ye commandments of god /
for no other cause, but that they were more full sacyate / and quyete, than was
expedyent, as he said Deutronomie the.32. chap. And Israel waxed corsye and
kycked, waxed corsye, thycke and smothe / and let god go ye made him and
despised ye rock ye saved him, wherefore almighty god suffered him to have many
other enemies, who he would not put away, yt they should have no rest, but
excercyse them self to keep the commandments of god, as it is read
the.iiij. chapter of Iudyth. Thus he handeleth and punyssheth us with all
manner of aduersytie / he is so careful for us, to drive and teach us to call
upon his name / to desire faith and trust in him / and so to fulfill two the
first commandments.

HEre therefore folysshe men do peryllously / and specyallye these holy works,
which challenge any syngularytie to them self, one lerneth to bliss him self
/ ye other to defend him self, with letters / some ronneth to charmers,
prophesyers, and sothe sayers / this man seeks this, and this man that / and
all that they might be safe without aduersytie. Neither can it be told how
might lie the deuyls wytchecraftes reygne against this commandment by
charmynge and coniuryng with superstycyous, which be all done for this cause /
that they should have no neade in the name of god. By ye which things there
is much irreverence had to the two first commandments, because that such
things ben sought of ye devil, man, or other creature, which ought only to
be sought and found of god / by pure, plain, and bare faith and trust, with
a merye boldness / and by calling upon his holy name. Doste not thou thy
self therefore feel at thy fyngers ends, that it is a great folysshenes, to
believe the devil, man, and creature / and look for good things of them? And
yet without such faith and trust in them, it helps or profyteth nothing
to call upon them. What disceyte tha^ shall there be i^ ye good and faithful
god? or what should let us to trust and believe of much, yea and far more in
him as in man or devil? When that god does not only promise us succor, and
sure help, but shows it us by all manner occasions, dryuynge us to put such
faith and trust i^ him. Is it not a pyteous thing, and to be bewailed, that
the devil or man co^maundyng no thing another compellynge, but only hyghtynge
and promising should be set above god, which promyseth, compels, and
commands. Yea and more to be given to the devil than to god? we may well be
ashamed / if we take but even take example of them that trust in ye devil or
in man. For if the devil (although he be an ill and a lyenge spyryte (keep his
promise with them that come in to his felowshyppe / how much more will god
only mekest and truest keep promise with them that trust in him? The rich man
trusts and is bold in his riches, and money, and that profyteth him and will
not we trust and be bold in the living god? that he will and may help us?
it is a common saying / riches makes man bold, and it is true. As Barucke
writes the third chapter. Which treasure up silver and gold / in the
which men trust, and there is none end of their getting. But he is much
more bold that is moved by the high and everlasting good / in the which not
men / but only ye sons of god be bold and trustye.

But if no such aduersyte or trouble did compel us to call upon the name of
god, and to trust in him / yet only sin is suffycyent to exercise and styre
us to this work / for sin besegeth us with three strong hoostes Of the
which / the first is, our own flesh. The second, the world, the.iii. the
devil, by whom we be co^tynually provoked, styred, and grieved / for ye flesh
seeks pleasure and rest, ye world looks for riches / power and honor, the
devil seaketh pride, bostynge, and love of him self / and despysyng of all
other men / which be so mighty, that every one of them alone is strong
enough to oppress and overcome a man, the which truly we can never overcome
/ but by calling upon ye holy name of god, in sted fast faith. As Solomon
says the.xviii. chapitre of the proverbs. The strongest tower is the name of
god / the ryghtous man ronneth unto it, and he shall be lift up / so Dauyd in
the.115. psalm, I shall take the cup in the tha^kefull fyste, for ye help
brought me, and I shall call upon the name of ye lord. Also the.xvii. psalm: I
magfyed and worshypped the lord, and so was I saved from my enemies. These
works, and the power of the name of god, be unknown unto us / and that for
because we have not used them, nor ever fought gladly with our sins, as
thinkyng that we had no neade to call upon the name of god. And this fortuneth
because we be only exercysed in our propre works, which we do by our own
power.

ALso the works of this commandment be / yt we should not swear, curse, lie,
deceive, and charm, by ye holy name of god another exercise any other mysuses,
the which be so great that they be known vnyuersallye to all men. For these
sins be only (for the most part) preached and showed in this
commandment / in the which is also comprehended that we should forbydde
other men to swear, to lie, to deceive, to curse, to charm, or by any other
means to sin, with the name of god, by ye which as there be many causes
given to do good deades / so there be to let ill. The chyefe cu^mau^deme^t of
this precept.
But the chyefe and most weyghtye work of this commandment, is to defend
the holy name to god against all the spyrytuall mysuses. and to set that
forth among all men. For it is not enough that for my self and in my
self, I praise and call upon the name of god as well in aduersytie as in
prosperyte / but I must neades show this name for the, and lade my self with
the hatered of all men for the glory of this name / as Christ said to his
discyples, you shall be hated of al men for my name. Here we must dyseplease
father, mother, and our best friends, here we may withsta^de our officers, and
segnyours both spyrytuall and temporal, and we must be rebuked as stubborn
and dysobedyent. Here the right and great learned men, and they that seem holy
with the all worldly men must be against us. And though they be chyefelye
bound to do these things, to whom is committed the chyefe of preaching /
yet every Christen man is bound to the same, when time and place requires it
/ for we ought to pay and to give all that we have or may do, for the name of
god, and to prove in deed that the name, honor, and laud of god is derer to
us, than al other things, and to trust in him above all things / and to look
for all goodness of him, and so to profess him that we take him for ye highest
good of al / and for whose name we be redye to leave and forsake all other
things.

Here we must withstand all iniuryes and wickedness, where as other the
treuthe or right be in danger, or sufferyth vyolence, or necessyte. Neither
should be here have respect to any person, as many men do, greatly stryuynge
for wrong done unto the rich mighty men, and to their friends, but where as
any such things fortune to the poor and subject men, or to their enemies /
they rest and let them alone / such men look not upon the name of god in
them self, but through a painted wyndowe measurynge the veryte and right
after the respect of persons. They find never out their own false eye,
which look more upon the person than the cause. These be very flaterers and
hypocrytes / having no thing to defend the truth with / but clokynge and
coloring. For they know very well that there is no ieoperdy to favor the
rich, mighty, and conning men, and their friends, of whom they may receive
thanks, be defended, and honored again. With such easynes may a man
withstand wrongs done to bysshoppes, kings, princes, and other great men /
for to help and defend them, every man stryueth to be best. O how preuye
is this disceytfull Adam with his wit / which goodlye cloketh the
covetousness of his profit with ye name of verytie, and uistyce, and with the
name fo god. But wha^ any such thing happens unto a neadye or poor man /
than this false eye fyndeth not so much profit, though he perceive never so
well, the hate of the rich men, and so forsakes the poor manne, carynge
for nothing less / thanne to help him that is in trouble. Who can nombre the
multitude of this sin that is in Chrystendome? So says god, the.81. Psalm.
How long will ye judge wrong fullye and take upon you the face of ungodly
men? Se that you deliver in judgment the poor and young fatherless / set
the troubledde and oppressyd men in their right / avenge the poor
forsakenne, and neadye / and to delyuere them fromme the hands of the
ungodly. But for as much as they do none of these, it follows, that they
another know nor perceive any thing, but stycke in the respect and persons of
men, that be of great power, how vnryghtous soever they be, and know not the
pore men, be they never so rightwyse.

LO here might a man do many god works. For ye greattest part of men of
power, rich men, and our friends, do wrong and exercise vyolence, and
tyrrannye, in the nedy, poor, and adversaries. And ye geratter a man is, ye
worse he is commonly. Wherefore there as thou canste not let such vyole^ce, and
help the truth / yet show it in words, and another assente nor favor to ye
vnryghtwyse, but speak ye truth plainly. For what I pray you, profyteth it a
man to do all good works, run to Rome, and to all other holy places / to
build and found churches and colleges, to purchase all pardons, and yet
find him self fawty in the name and honor of god? because that his name
being hyd / and suppressed they set more by their own goods, honors, and
favor of their friends / than they did by the truth / which is the name and
very honor of god / yea what man is he / that has not such good works,
daily and hourelye coming home to his doors and house? that he needs not to
run farther, or inquyre much for good works. For if we would look upon the
life of man, and mark with how little regard all things be done both here /
and every where / we should be compelled to cry with ye prophet saying / every
man is a liar. Of a truth all men be false liars and deceyuers / All men be
liars.
for the cheyf true and pryncypall work set a part, they garnysshe and
paynt them selves / with the least and vile works / and yet they would be
counted good, and clym^e to heaven with a sure quyetnes, and rest. But
perauenture some man will say, wherefore does not god help the pore alone,
seeing that he knows and may help every man? I answer that he knows and
may help and do it, but he will not do it alone / for he will work together
with us / and by us / But albeit we refuse to do him this honor. Yet
nevertheless / he will perform it, helping the pore, and dampne such with ye
vnryghtwyse, as will not help them, but despise the great honor of his
work, as men that favored the vnryghtwyse. And albeit he be blyssed alone,
yet he gives us the same honor, because he will not be blyssed alone, but
will have us blyssed together with him. And moreover if god should do all these
things alone, his commandments should be given in vain no man having a
cause to exercise him self, in the great works of his precepts. Nether should
any man have any sure proof or experyence, whether he trusted faithfully in the
name of god or no, An innocent life, and good works ben five tokens of a
right faith.
and allowed it for ye highest good that is or no. And whether that he will put
him self in all ieoperdyes for him or no.

IT pertayneth also to this work to resyste all false, perverse / deceyuable
erronyous doctrine and heresies / and all ye abuse of the spyrytuall and
ecclesyastycall power, the which is a merueylouse high thing / for they
straytelye withstonde the name of god / with the name of god / Wherefore it
seems to be great Ieoperdye to gaynesaye them, when they cloak them selfs,
saying. Who soever resysteth them, resysteth god and all his saints / whose
stead they be in, and whose power they do use, saying that it was spoken to
them by Christ. He that hears you, hears me / and he ye despysyth you,
despysyth me / to the which words they stycke styffely and be fyerce and
bold to command to do and leave undone what so ever they will / to
exco^munycate, curse, take a way, sleye / and do all other wyckednes, rebukes,
and shames after their own pleasur without any let, but Christ did not think
them to be obe^yed in all thing which they speak and do / but only when
they put forth unto us the word of the gospel, and not their own word / or
else how should we have known to avoid their lies and sins? for we must
neades have a rule, to show wherein they must be obeyed and followed / which
rule must be given to us not of them but of god, to the which we must order
and use our selfs / as we shall here in the fourth commandment. Thus
therefore must it be / that in the spyrytuall degree / the more part be false
doctrine, prechynges, and the abuse of the Ecclesiastycall power, to the end
that we may have cause and occasyon to do the works of this commandment,
and that we should be proved / what we will do, or leave undone, for the honor
and glory of god / against the ungodly blasphemers of him and his name. O I
would to god / that here we were as we ought to be. How often than should the
false offycyalles set forth, both the popes and the bysshoppes
exco^munycacyon in vain? how greatly then should ye thundrynges of Rome /
faint and decay? how often should he hold his peace / whom all the world is
compelled to here? how few prechers should than be found in Chrystendome. But
this myschefe has so long prevailed that, what soever they ordeyne must be
just and right. Here is no man that will strive for the name and glory of
god. Truly I believe that there is no greatter syn^e / another more committed by
the outward works / then in this commandment. For it is higher then that
many can understand and perceive it / and so ornate with the name and power of
god / that it is ieoperdye to touch it. But the prophets were ones chief /
craft masters in this thing, and after them / the Apostles / and specyallye
saint Paul another regarded nor cared, whether the high priest, As it
appears ye.2. chapter to the Galatyens where Paul rebukes peter openly,
for his dyssymulacion.
or the low priest said it / whether he did it in the name of god / or that
he did it in his own name / for they marked the words and the deades, and
compared them with the commandments of god / not lokynge whether great
John^ / or little Nycholas spoke or did either in gods name or in man's. And
for this cause they were put to death / of ye which thing, much more / might be
spoken now in our time, wherein all things be done out of frame. But Christ
and paul must hyde these things, with their holy names, all though there can
be no more shamfull a cloak of sin in the world / than the most holy and
blyssed name of christ Ihesu. Wherefore a man may abhor this life / only
for the abuse and blasfeme the holy name of god / And if these thing continue
any longer, I am a frayde lest, for god / they shall worshype the devil. Our
holy and spyrytuall men do all things with such abhomynable boldness / and
without any shame. Therefore it is high time / that we pray hertely to god /
that he will sanctyfye his name. But ye must be with the blood of them that
set in ye goodness of martyrs, He means that we be saved by the word,
wherefore the martyrs shed their blood.
and which be gotten and saved with their blood. And eue^ they them selves
must be martyrs again / of the which thing / we shall speak more an other
time.

The third commandment.
WE have now seen how many good works, be in ye second commandment, of
god / which be not good in them selves / except they proceed out of faith /
and trust of the love of god toward us / I would to god therefore we kept only
this commandment so that we were not so occupied and busye with other works
/ that we utterly forget this work / now than follows ye third
commandment. Keep thy sabbath day, ye thou sanctyfye it / as ye lord thy god
has commanded the / In the first it is commanded how yt our heart ought to
be before god in thoughts. In ye second both in heart and also in mouth with
words. In this third is commanded how we should give our selfs to god by
works / And this the right and first table of Moses / in the which these
three commandments be written, rulynge man on the right side / yt is to say /
in such things as perteyne unto god / without the mean of any creature. The
first works therefore of this precept be gross and sensyble / which the most
part we call divine service, as to here mass, to pray, to hear sermons, upon
the holy days / and after this opinion: there be but few good works in this
commandment. And yet these except they ron out of ye love, grace, trust, and
faith of god / be nothing at all as I said before. Wherefore it were well if
there were less holy days / in asmoche as now a days / the works done in
such holy days ben commonly worse than the works of feryall or workye days
by Idelnes, eating, drynkyng, playeng and such other ill deeds. Moreover the
masses be herd without any profit, and the prays said without any faith. For
ye most perte thus it is / that we think we have done enough / when we have
seen mass with our eyes / prayed with our mouth / passing over these things
outwardlye, not thinking that we should conceive some thing of the mass in
to our hertes / that we should get some lernyng out of ye sermo^de / and that
we should desire / ask, and look for some thing in our prayers. Albeit here is
ye greattest fault of bishops, and prestes, and of them to whom the office of
preaching is enjoined, in that, that they preach not the gospel, and teach
not men / how they should se mass, here sermondes / and pray / wherefore we
will declare these three works in few words.

IN the mass it is necessary / that we be there present in heart / How ye
mass ought to be herd and what to be done thereat of ye hearers.
and than be we present in heart / when we exercise faith in our heart, here we
ought to nombre and weye the words of Christ: whereby he ordained ye mass,
saying / Take and ete / this is my body which is given for you / likewise over
the cup / take and drink of this all / this is ye cup of the new
Testament / in my blood / which for you and many shall be shed / so often as
you shall do this / do it in the remembrance of me. By these words / Christ
ordained Diriges and year minds / daily to be kept for him / through out
all Chrystendome And made solemn, lawful / rich, and so great a testament /
in the which he bequethed, no rentes monye, or temporal goods / but
forgyuenesse of all sins, grace, mercy / and everlasting life / that who
soever come to these diriges / may have this testament. And upon this he dyed /
whereby this testament was made sure fyrme and stable, and never to be revoked.
And in a token of yt / in the stead of a writing and seal / he has left
here his proper body under bread and wine. Here now therefore is neade / that
a man exercise well ye first work of this commandment / yt he doubt
nothing: but that this is for a suertye, and that he suffer and believe the
testament to be certain unto him / lest he make christ a liar. For what other
thing is it / if thou, standing at the mass and another think nor believe / ye
christ has bequethed and given the / by his testament forgyuenes sins /
than as if thou should say, I know not or believe not that it is true / that
forgyuenes of all my sins is here bequethed and given unto me. O how many
masses ben there now in ye world? and how few that hear them / after this
faith and manner? whereby god is grievously offended. Wherefore there is no man yt
hears mass profytablye / except other yt he be in aduersytie, temptacyons,
and desiring ye grace of god / or else which would gladlye be rydde of his
sins, or else if he be in an ill mind, and yet change it in the mean time /
and attain the desire of the testament. And for this cause the common and
open sinners, wear not suffered in times paste to come to mass. Therefore this
faith, going right forth after her manner / it can not be / but the heart of
man / made merye with this testament must wax hoote and melte in ye love of
god / and than follows praise and gyuyng of thanks with a sweet heart / upon
this in ye greek tongue / the mass is called Eucharistia / that is to say,
Eucharistic.
kyndnes or gyuynge of thanks / because we praise god, and give him thanks /
for such a comfortable, rich and blyssed testamente, even as he / whom a
notable and faithful friend has bequethed a thousand pou^des or more /
prayseth, gives thanks / and is merye. But it happens often times to christ
/ as it does to some other / which by their testament make them, that they
bequethed unto, rich / which never after remember them / another praysynge nor
gyuynge unto them thanks. So be our masses done now a days / yt we in the
mean time / another know nor be sure what they profytte us / or wherefore they
be done / which thing is the cause / that we another praysyng, another gyuyng
thanks / nor dylygent / but dry and hard, continue at mass / content with
our own prayers and small deuocyons / of the which I shall speak more an
other time.

Preaching should be none other thing / Preaching.
but the declarynge of this testamente / but who can here, when no man does
preach? for now truly they understand not this testament / whose duty it is
to preach it / and prechynges also for the most part go a broad / and at
large into tryfelyng tales nothing worth / and so whiles Christ is forgotten /
it happens to us as it did to them in the.iiii. book of kings, the.vii.
chapter / thou shalt se / and thereof thou shalt not eat / because that we
seeing our good, do not use it / of ye which speaks Ecclesiastices. This is a
great myschyefe, ye god has given riches to man / which he suffers him not
to use. So we se innumerable masses, and yet ignorau^te in ye mean time
whether the mass be a testament or no / or rather some other thing / as
though it were a good work by it self. The mass is no good work of it
self, that is to wit, it profyteth not when it is herd or said without the
faith thereunto, necessarely requesyte, and this is thauthors mind.
O good lord / how utterly blinded be we? But where as this thing is well
preched / it must neades be delygentlye hard, received, often times spoken of
/ and so shall the faith be strengthed against te^ptacyons of sins, past,
present, and to come. Lo this is the only ceremony, and the only exercise
ordained of Christ / in ye which we ought all to be gathered together, come
together, exercysed, and be agreed. The which ceremony is not yet, as other
bare ceremonies ben / but he has put in it an excellent rich treasure / to be
delivered and given to all the^ yt believe in this testament / with such
preaching should the sinner be provoked / that he being sorye for his sins /
may be kyndell with the desire of this treasoure / therefore it is a great sin
of the^, that here not the gospel / and regard not such treasoures, and so
rich a feast / to ye which they be called / but it is a greatter sin not to
preach the gospel, and to suffer so many people / desirous to here the
gospel, to peryshe, notwithstanding the strayte commandment and ordenaunce
of Christ to the contrary which will no mass to be done / but that even than
the gospel also should be preached / The gospel ought to be preached at every
mass.
as he himself said / so often as you shall do this / you shall do it in my
remembrance / wherefore it is a fearful and abhomynable thing / to be a
bysshope / a curate / a parysshe pressed / or a precher now adays / for there
is no man yt less knows this testamente I tell not, how few there be that
preach it. And yet this is their special office and only duetye / How
hard account / therefore shall they make for so many souls lost / for the
lack of such preachynges.

WE must pray / Prayer.
not as it is co^menlye used, to mu^ble up many leaves, or bedestones, but to
take in our hands some present troubles / and handel them with all our desire,
and in them to exercise our faith and trust toward god / that we doubt not
but that we shall be hard. Saint Bernarde.
So saint Bernarde taught his brethren to pray, saying / dear brethren
despice not your prayers / for I tell you for a truth before you have ended
your words, your prayer is written i^ heaven / and one of these two / may you
be sure of upon god / that ones your prayer shall be fulfilled / or if it be
not fulfilled / it should not be for your profit / that it were fulfilled. So
is prayer, a synguler exercise of the faith / which faith makes the prayer so
acceptable to god / that other it shall be fulfilled / or else better shall be
given tha^ is asked. So said saint James / By James words every man may
perceive the great force and strength of a sure faith.
if any that is among you lack wisdom / let him ask of god, which gives to
all men abundantly / and casts no man in the tethe with his benefyces, and it
shall be given him / but let him ask in faith and waver not / for he that
doubts is like the waves of the sea, toste of the wind and carried with
vyole^ce / another let that man think, that he shall receive any thing of god.
Is not this a plain and clear sentence / as it promyseth to him that byleueth
/ He that byleueth not receives no benefyte.
so it denies to him that byleueth not, that he shall another obtain that
which he desires, nor no better. And to stir up this same faith / Christ
him self said. Mark ye.xi. chap. Therefore I say unto you / what soever you
desire wha^ you pray / believe yt you shall have it, and it shall be done unto
you. And Luke the xi. And I say unto you / ask and it shall be given you / seek
and you shall find / knock and it shall be opened unto you / for every man
that asks, receives / and he that seeks, fyndeth / and to him that
knocks, shall it be opened / if ye sone axe bread (says Christ) of any of
you which is his father / will he profre him a stone? or if he ask fysshe /
will he give him a serpent? if ye than which are evil / know how to give
good gifts unto your children / how much more, shall your father celestyal
give a good spyryte to them yt desire it of him.

WHo is so herd or so stonye, when such mighty and strong words can not
move to pray merely and boldly with all trust? But now how many prayers were
it need to reform, if we should pray a right? Be not al churches and abbeys
full and replenysshed with prayers and songs? And how is it, that there
comes so little profit of them? Yea that it is every day worse and worse?
Certeyse there is no other cause, but that that saint James shows, saying /
ye ask, and ye receive not / because ye ask it evil / for if this trust and
faith in prayer want, the prayer is dead / and nothing else, but a
paynfull labor and werynes / for ye which, if there be any thing given / it
is naught but temporal profit / without any good help of the soul / yea
rather they be great hurtes and blyndynges of the souls / in the which they
proceed, mumblyng much with the mouth / not regarding to trust to obtain
yt, which they desire / and so they co^tynue styffelye in such vnfaythefulnes
/ as in most the worste custom that can be against the use of faith / and the
nature of prayer. Whereof which that follows / that he that preaches truly
/ doubts not, but that his prayer is for a surety accepted and hard / yea
though he obtain not that, that he desires. For in our prayer we may set
our trouble before god, but yet we can appoynte him no manner of measure, mean,
end, mark, or place to help us / but permyt all unto him / which will give
other that / or better than we can ymagyne or think / As saint Paul says
to the Romans, the.viii. chapter / and to the Ephesianes the.iii. chapter.
And god works more profoundely and better / than we perceive and understand
/ so that there must be no doubt, but that the prayer is herd and accepted.
Provided always that the time, place, manner and end, be fre to god / which
knows best how to end the matter / as it is most conuenyent. These be the
true worshyppers / which worship the father in spyryte and truth. For
whosoever believe not their prayer to be herd, do sin upon ye lift hand,
against this commandment, bowynge to much from it by vnbyleue. But they
that set god a mark or measure, sin upon ye right hand, coming to nyghe
by temptyng of god. But god has forbyden / yt we should swerve from his
commandment, either upon the right hand, or upon the lift hand / that is,
that we should not sin, another by vnbyleue, nor by temptyng of god / but
abiding in the plain and straight way of faith / we should trust in him /
and not set him any term to help us.

SO we se, yt as the second commandment / so this ought to be nothing else,
but the exercise and workynge of the first commandment / that is to say, of
faith, trust, boldenes, hope, and love toward god / so that the first
commandment is the ruler and captain in all the other commandments / and
faith is ye chyefe work and life of all other works / without ye which (as
it is said before) they cannot be good. But and if thou will say / what and I
can not believe that my prayer is hard and accepted / I answer specyallye for
that cause / faith, prayer, and all other good works be commanded, yt thou
may know what thou canste do / and what thou canste not do / but and if
thou find thy self, that thou can not believe and do / than do thy dylygence,
to humble thy self before god / making thy complaynte, and beginning, in
this weak sparkyll of faith / stablysshe and comfort it every day more and
more / by use in all thy life, and in all thy works. For there is no man in the
world, which lacks not a great part of faith / that is of the first and
chyefe commandment. Yea the holy apostels in the gospel / and specially
saint Peter, were weak in the faith / so yt they prayed Christ saying.
Lord increase faith in us / and he also rebuked them / because they had weak
faith. Therefore thou ought not to dyspayre / leuynge as they say (hand
and foot) when thou perceyuest that thou byleuest not so stronglye in thy
prayer or other works / as thou ought and would / yea than thou ought to
thank god, with all thy heart / that he has showed thy weakness unto the /
teaching and warning the by that / how necessary it is for the to exercise
and daily stablysshe thy self in faith. For how many doste thou se /
fasting, prayeng, singing, redynge, workynge, shynynge, as though they were
meruaylous holy and good / and yet never coming so far, that they know
how yt faith is ye chyefe work of all other / whereby they be blinded and
deceived / both them selfs and other / also thinking them selfs well enough
and buyldyng upon the gravel of their own works without all faith. And not
trustyng upon ye favor and promise of god by sure and pure faith. And thus
thou see that we have enough to do all our life / to do ye works of the
first commandment and faith, ever learning and contynueng scolers / for no
man knows, how great a thing it is, to believe only in god / but he that
begins to practyse it.

Now se again / if there were no other work commanded / than prayer, were
it not only enough to exercise in faith, all the time of man's life? for the
which purpose specially were ordained holy ordres / and in time past, some holy
fathers prayed both night and day / yea there is no man at all, but yt he
has to pray at al times without ceasyng. But I speak of spyrytual prayer / yt
is no man is so payned with his labor (if he will) but he may also speak to
god in his heart / and set before him, other his own troubles, or other men's
/ prayenge and besechyng for help / and in all these exercise and strength his
faith / for this is it that our lord would. Luke ye.18. saying we must pray
without ceasynge / all though Mathewe the.vi. he forbid many words and long
prayers / in the which he rebuked ye Pharyseis and hypocrytes / not that vocal
and long prayers be evil / but that it is not the true prayer which must be
done always / and which without ye inward prayer of faith, is naught worth /
for ye outward prayer must be used also at times / specially at mass, as it
is required by this commandment / and not only than, but also at any other
time where soever it shall profit to thynwarde prayer and faith / whether ye
be at home, in ye fylde, or in any other work. Whereof now it is no time to
speak more / for it pertayneth to ye Pater nr^ / in the which al peticyons
and vocal prayers be comprehended in short words.

WHere be they now yt desire to know and do good works? What soever they be,
let the^ set only prayer before them / and they shall find this true / that
holy fathers have said / there is none so great labor, as it is to pray / it
is but a light thing to mumble with thy mouth / Here haste thou descrybed
whatte true prayere is.
but to put out the words sadlye with thy heart, with inward godliness, and
devotion. That is with desire and faith, that the heart may ernestly ask that
thing / that ye words pretend / doubting not but that it shall be herd.
This truly is a good work in ye sight of god / and to let this, the devil
stryueth and wrasteleth with all his might. O how often would he let our
pleasure in prayenge / and suffer us another time nor place / yea often times
make us dyspayre / whether a man be worthy to pray to so high a majesty as
god is / and so provoke man, yt he can not tell / whether that it be in erneste
or no that he prays / whether it be possible / that this prayer be accept or
not / and many such other thoughts, cast the devil to us / for he knows
how mighty, strong, and profitable to all men / is the prayer of a faithful
man. Wherefore he would not gladly suffer us to pray. Here a man must play the
wise man / and not for this cause to dyspeyre / yt other our selfs or our
prayers be unworthy in the sight of the exceeding majesty of god / nor to
labor by his own worthynesse / nor to live by this unworthiness / but we
must mark the commandment of god, and lay that against him / and to
preuente the devil / saying as I will begin nothing by my own worthynesse
/ so I will omytte nothing for mine unworthiness. For I do only pray and
work for this / yt god of his pure mercy and grace, has promised hearing
and grace to all men / though they be unworthy / yea he has not alonly
promised / but also most ernestly commanded under the pain of his everlasting
indygnacyo^ and anger / to pray, to be bold, and to receive. If therefore it
was no little thing to so high a majesty / to bind so greatly such his
unworthy worms / to pray, to trust i^ him, and to receive of him / how
should it be a little thing to me / to take such a commandment with all joy /
whether I be worthy or unworthy? Thus the suggestyon of the devil / must be
overthrown, by the commandment of god / for so wol he leave us, or else never.

The causes and necessytyes yt should move us to pray.
But what be ye causes and necessyties / yt should be put and complained upon to
almyghtye god in prayer / to exercise faith? I answer first of all / ben
pryuate troubles, temptacyons, and aduersyties of a man's own / of the which
speaks Dauyd the.31. psalm. Thou art my defender from trybulacyon, thou
shall keep me / and make me glade excedyngly for my delyuerau^ce. Also the.141.
psalm. I cried unto the lord / before ye lord I fell down and made my prayer
/ before him I powered forth my heavy medytacyon / before him I laid my strayte
anguysshe. So ought a christen man to remember him self before mass / what he
thinks what he lacks, or what he has to much / and to power that freely
out before god, weeping, mourning, syghynge / and that as pyteously as he can
/ as before his most trustye father and most ready to help him. But and if thou
another know, nor perceive thy necessyties / or if thou lack temptacyon, or
persecucyon / tha^ think thy self in an evil case. For this is the greattest
persecucyon / if thou feel thy self / so blockysshe, so herd, so dull, that
thou art moved by no persecucyon. There is no better glass / The glass, in
the which we may se our necessyties, is the commandment of god.
wherein thou may behold thy necessyties / than the.x. commandments of
god / in the which thou may find, what thou want, and what thou
ought to seek / and so thou shalt find in thy self weak faith /
sclender hope, little love toward god / and that thou do another praise nor
worship him / but love thine own praise and bostyng, and set much by
the favor of men / not glad to here mass, and sermons / slow to pray, in
which things, every man fails and does amysse / Such defautes, thou
ought to regard more, than all corporal damages / of fame, of honor, or
of body, in so much that they are more to be sorowed, tha^ death it self, or
all bodily dyseases. Which all thou ought to lay before god with
reverence, fear, and faith, complaining and cryenge for help, with all
trust / lokynge surely to be herd, and that he will grant the socoure and
grace. And of this facyon, going further in the second table of the
commandments of god / take heed how dysobedyent thou haste ben / and yet
art, to thy father and mother, to the officers, and superyours / how thou
haste offended thy neighbor with anger, hate, and checkes / how that
wantones, couetyse, and vnryghtwysenesse has tempte the / both in word and
deed / and than without doubt, thou shalt find thy self full of trouble and
myseryes / that thou should have cause enough (if thou myghtest) to weape
tears of blood.

But I know many, that be so folysshe, yt they will not pray and desire such
things, before they find them selves clean / thinking that god hears
none yt is in sin / the which thing all togythers false prechers have made /
which teach that we must begin / not at the grace of god and faith / but
at our own works. Now behold thou wretched man / if thy leg be broken /
or if thou be brought in to any other bodily ieoperdye / thou call upon god
or upon this saint or that / and taryeste not until thy leg be hole or thy
ieoperdy be past. Another art thou so folysshe, ye thou will think, that no
man shall be herd that has a broken leg / as in ieoperdy of death. Yea thou
thynkest than to be most specyallye herd of god / when thou art in most
ieoperdye and sorrow. Wherefore tha^ art thou so folysshe here / where is most
necessytye and greattest hurt / that thou will not first pray / for faith,
hope, love, humylytie, obedience, chastetye, gentylnes, peace, and
ryghtwysenesse / before thou be without all vnbyleue, wa^tones, couetyse, and
vnryghtwysenes / wha^ that the more thou fyndest thy self a sinner i^ these
things / the more largelye thou ought to pray and call to god. We be so
blind, that i^ bodily troubles and sins we ron unto god / but in the
syckenes of our souls we run from him, not wyllyng to come to him, except we
be hoole and perfyte before / as though god were not always one in helpyng the
body and ye soul / or as though we could help our self in spyrytuall
trouble / which is greatter than bodily dyseases, in the which we can not
help our self. This is a deuelysshe counsel and purpose. Therefore (O man) do
not so / for if thou be wyllyng to be helped of thy sins / thou must not
withdraw thy self from god / but much more boldelye run and preyse unto
him / tha^ if bodily trouble and persecucion come upon the. God refuses no man
but if he refuse him first by unfaithfulness.
For god is no enemy to syn^ers / but to unfaithful / ye is to them ye knowledge
not their sins, and will not compain and seek to god for help, but of their
own pride and presu^pcion first do purge them selfs / as men yt will not
stand need of his grace / and as men, not sufferyng god to be with the^ / which
gives to al men freely, and receives nothing again.

ALl these things be spoken of ye prayer, both for thine own trouble and also
for common trouble / but prayer properly pertaynyng to this commandment, To
this commandment pertayneth common prayer, for all chrystendome.
is called the work of the holy day / much better and greatter to be done for all chryste^dome for ye troubles of al me^ / for enemies and friends, specially
for them ye be i^ every man's parysshe or dyoces / and so said saint Paul to
his dyscyple Timothe, in his first epistle the.ii. chapter saying, I exhort
therefore ye above al things prayers, supplycacyons, peticyons, and gyuynge of
thanks / be had for all men / for kings and for all that are had in
prehemynence / ye we may live a quyete and peasable life in all godliness and
honestye / for yt is good and accepted in the sight of god our savior. And
Heremie the.xxix. chapter / he commanded the people of Israel to pray to god
for the city, and for the country of Babylon / because that the peace of
Babylon, was thieves also. And Baruche the first chapter. Pray you for the
life of Nabugodono for king of Babylon, and for ye life of Balthazar, his sone
/ that their days may be as the days of heaven upon earth / and that the lord
would give us virtue and light our eyes / that we may live under the shadow
of Nabugodonosor king of Babylon / and under the shadow of his sone Balthazar
/ and that we may serve them many days, and find favor in their syghte. This
commune and public prayer is most precious and effectuous, for the which
also we come together. Also upon this the temple is called the house of prayer
/ that there all together we should set our eyes / both upon our own trouble
/ and the trouble of all other, and show them unto god / calling for grace.
But this must be ernestlye done / and which true compassyon that we moved by
such trouble and evil of al men / and by clear petye upon them / we may pray
for them in true faith and trust. Where therefore such prayer, is not done at
mass / it were surer and better not to be at mass. Against private prayers.
For how does it agree / that we come boldly all together in the house of
prayer / whereby is sygnifyed, ye we should invoke and pray openly for the
universal company of all faithful people / and in the mean time, we so
scatter and deuyde our prayers / ye every man prays only for him self no man
caryng or busye for other / another pyteynge other men's trouble / how tha^ can
this prayer be called profitable / good, acceptable, common, or ye work of ye
holy day, and coming together / as they make it / wha^ every man keeps his
own propre prayer / this man prayeng for one thing / and yt for another /
having nothi^ge but prayers / serving for their own private profit, which
god hates.

OF this common prayer, after the old custom / is this argument left us / yt
in ye end or in some other time of the sermonde, We have a toke^ yet left in
the church of the common prayour.
is the beads rehersyd / and they pray for all chrystendome / and the company
there gathered together. But they should not live here as though ye matter were
ended, as the manner and use is now / but there ought to be a warnyng yt they
should pray all ye mass time / for such troubles as ye precher shall put us in
remembrance yt we be indau^gered to. And yt we may pray worthily / he warns
us before of our sins, to make us low / which must be don with few words,
yt the people may al together by the^ self, show their sins to god / so
prayeng i^ faith for all men / even from ye heart. Oh, I would to god yt some
company might here mass and pray after this manner, ye openly and in ye company
might arise a clear cry from ye heart, and asce^de to god / how inestymable
virtue and help should follow of such a prayer / what thing may be more
fearful to all evil spyrytes? what greatter work can be done in the world
/ by the which so many good men may be preserved, and so many sinners
converted? for the congregacyon of Christ in earth / has no greatter power or
greatter work / tha^ such open and common prayere / against al aduersytie /
that may happen unto it. And that the devil knows well / and therefore he
goes about to let this prayer. Here he suffers us to build goodly
churches / to found many chauntryes / to blow and play upon ye organs, to
read, to sing, to say many masses / and to exercise innumerable such other
ceremonies, which he fears not / yea he so furthereth them / that we judge
such for the best / and think the matter is well ended with such worshyppynge.
But among all these, when this common strong and profitable prayer is
subverted / and by this manner letten alone / he has that he would. For this
prayer laid aside or banysshed away / no man can take any thing fro the
devil, or strive against him. But he will watch if we use any such prayer /
Yea and if it be in our cotage, or poor thackyd house / truly he will not
suffer it (if he may) to proceed / but fears it, much more / than all the
high, great, and godly churches / towers, belles, where soever they be / if
there be no such prayer in them: truly it makes no matter, in what places or
buyldynges we come together / but all the pythe is i^ this inuyncyble prayer /
that we all universally do it well / and that we care that it may come to god.

The virtue of a devout and faithful prayer.
WE may conjecture ye might and power of this prayer / up on this / that
Abraham prayed us for the five cities / Sodoma, Gomor. etc. And he prevailed so
much, that if there had been ten ryghtwyse men in them / that is in every
one of them two / god would not have dystroyed them. What than shall be done
by this prayer / where many in one congregacyon / and trusting in the true god
/ call hertely upon him / as saint James says / pray ye one for another, that
ye may be healed / the prayer of a ryghtwyse man avails much if it be
fervent / that is to say / not leaving to pray more and more / yea though
he obtain not by and by that, that he asks / as do some men that be weak
spyryted / of the which he brings an example and says. Helyas was a man in
danger to trybulacyon, as we are / and he prayed in his prayer / that it
might not rain / and it rayned not on the earth, by the space of.iii. years
and six months / and again he prayed, and the earth brought forth her
fruit. There ben many such sayenges and examples mouynge us in scripture. But
yet this prayer must be done with grauyte, faith, and from ye heart / as says
Dauyd / the eyes of ye lord be upon ryghtwyse men / and his ears upon their
prayers. And also the lord is nyghe unto them / that call upon him / to all
that call upon him in truth / why did he add to them / that call upon him in
truth? because yt there is another prayer nor inuocacyon / where ye mouth
only mumbleth. The only mumblynge with ye lyppes is no prayer.
What than will god do with the / when thou co^mest with thy book, with thy
mouth, with thy beads / and thynkest no other thing / but yt thou may
end thy prayer and fulfill thy nombre? so that if thou be asked what was the
cause / or wherefore thou purposedest to pray / thou know not thy self /
another dyddest thou consydre or regard to put forth this or that unto god / or
to ask any thing of him. This is the only cause / that this and so many
prayers be enjoined unto the / this will thou keape and no more. What marvel
therefore is it / that the churches be often times set a fire with lightening
and thundre from heaven / Churches set a fire.
seeing that of the house of prayer / we make ye house of mocking and
yllusyone? shall we say that we pray / wha^ we another set forth any thing,
nor ask any thing. But we should do as they do / that ask any thing of a
greatter prince / which do not only purpose to clatter with the mouth many
words / (for than ye prince would think that they mocked him / or yt they
were mad) but they that shall go unto such princes / consider their matter
well before, and declare well and dylygentlye their trouble / and yet they
permytte all to his grace / trustyng that they shall be herd / so must we do
with god / with a sure and indoubted accyon / expressing some troubles by name
/ showing the^ by his favor and good will / doubting nothing but yt we
shall be hard / for he has promised yt he will here such a prayer, the
which no other erthely god has promised.

When we be let with bodily trouble / than we know perfyghtlye this manner of
prayer. For when we be taken with syckenesse / we call upon saint Chrystofer
in this place / and saint Barbara in that place. Here we vow to saint James,
there to a another saint. Than pray we with heart and mind / than is our trust
good / and all the condycyons of prayer requisyte ben present. But when we come
in to ye church to mass, we stand like images / and can remember nothing /
another show or compain any thing / there our beade stones makes a noise,
and our leaves sound / and our mouth mumbleth, and nothing else do we. And if
thou wylt ask, what thing thou should put forth or complain of / if thou
be not learned, open thy eyes, and look upon thy life / and the lyfes of other
christen men / and specially of the state of the spyrytualtie / and thou shalt
than find, how yt faith, hope, charytie, obedyence, chastytye, and to be
short / all other virtues be banysshed / and all manner of vices now reygne.
Thou shalt se how great a lack is of good prechers / how yt there be none
that rule, but vain persons, women, boys, and foles. Than thou shalt find,
that it is necessary for all ye world to pray every hour with blodye tears
/ that this excedyng indygnacyon of god, cease / for this is true / yt it was
never more need of prayer than now, and shall be hereafter to the worlds
end. Wherefore if thou be not moved to pytie and complaynte, by so many
troubles and myseryes / se that thy own condycyon, state, degree, thy own
good work or prayer, corrupt or deceive the not / yea to be plain thou have
no point of a christyan in the. How good soever thou thynkest thy self. But
it was prophesyed long before that all these things should happen, and that
god being most anger / and the christen people sufferynge many troubles /
there should be no intercessours or prayers for them to god / as Esaye says
weapyng, the.64. there is none that will call upon thy name, or that might rise
and hold the. Also Ezechiell the.2.2. chapy. I have sought for a man among
them, the which may set a hedge, and stand against me for the earth / Behold
here the wrath of god and learn to fere it.
that I should not destroy it / but I found none / and I have powered my
indygnacyon upon them. And I have wasted them in the fire of my wrath / by
the which words god shows, how that he would we should resyste him / and
prevent his ire / as it is often read of the prophet Moses / which often times
by prayer held god / that he powered not his wrath upon the people of Israel.

But where shall they abide / which not alonlye care not and bewail not such
calamyte of christen people. But also they laughe standing in their own
conceyte / judging evil speaking, backebytynge, singing and speaking of
their neighbors fautes / and yet they be so without fear and shame / that
they doubt not to come into ye church to hear mass and pray, and to reken
them selfs good christen men. These men have need of twyse asmoch prayer as
they / whom they judge, mock and condemn. It was showed that such men
should come, by the thief that hanged on the lift hand of Christ which checked
Christ in his passion and trouble. These men also be like unto them that
blasphemed Christ upon the cross, what time they ought chefelye to have
helped him. O god how blind, ye how mad be we all christen men made. O
heavenly father when shall there be an end of this ire? ye we may ones make no
more blaspheme / and judge the sorrows of christen men / for ye which we should
come into ye church to mass / and gather together, to pray god to take the^
away. This makes our folysshe insensybilytie and grosenesse. For the Turk
pyllynge cities / countries, and men, we think that chrystendome has a great
loss / here we morn, here we call for help both kings and princes / but
that faith is lost / ye charytie waxes cold / yt the word of god is left of
/ ye all manner of sins prevail / here is no man at all yt ones thinks of
fighting against them / but rather ye Pope, bysshoppes, priests, and monks,
be much worse than the Turks / and they be the capytaynes and standerberers
of such Turks and deuelysshe hoostes / whom it would be seem to be ye guydes /
banerbearers, and rulers of this spirytuall wars / against these spirytuall
enemies. And as Judas was the guide to them that took Christ. (For it was
necessary that he should be an apostell / bishop, priest, or one of the
chyefe that should go about to oppress Christ). Even so chrystendome, must
be subverted of them / which ought to defend it. And yet they being in their
own opinion so strong / manly and wise / that they would eat up the Turk /
leave the fold and house of god kyndelyd and set a fire of their own selfs,
with ye sheep and all that is in it / not regarding to persecute the wolf
that lies hid in the grass. This therefore is the time and reward, more
mete and worthy for our unkindness / tha^ the favor of god, which Christ
got for us frelye by his precious blood / grievous labor and most bitter
death.

LO where be now these ydell men, which know not how they ought to do good
works? where be they ye run to Rome and to saint James? set before thine
eyes this one good work, the mass / lokynge upon the trouble and myserye of
thy neighbor / have pytie of his state / complain that unto god, and pray
to god for him / doing the same for the trouble of all chrystendome / and
especyally for all princes, prelates, and rulers / whom god suffers to fall
and to be synfully corrupt for our intolerable pain and punysshement. And if
thou do this delygently from the heart / be thou sure, yt thou art one of the
best warryours and capytaynes / not only against ye Turks / but also ye
deuyls and powers of hell. And I pray the, if thou do not this / what profit
is it to the, to do all ye miracles of all saints? to kill all Turks / and
yet be found coulpable and gyltie, as not regarding the sorrow of thy
neighbor / and by ye means, synnynge against the right. For Christ at the
last judgment, will not ask ye how much thou haste fasted, prayed, gone
pylgrymages, or done this or that, for thy self. But how much good thou have
done to other / yea yt were poor. And without doubt there be mo poor me^
oppressyd with sin / spirytuall poverty, Spirytuall poverty.
prison and need, than with bodily trouble. And therefore take heed to thy self
/ for our chosen works, and peculyar purposes, do bring us above our selfs /
so that we only seek for our own profit and welthe. But the commandments
of god / compelle us to our neighbors / and to serve for their welthe only /
by the example of Christ upon the cross, prayenge not only for him self /
but for us / saying, father forgive the^ / for they wot not what they do. So
must we one pray for another. Of this every man may know, how froward and
wicked this people is / which backebyte, judge rasshelye / and do none other
but despise the^ for whom they ought to pray / in the which vice, no man
stycketh so deapelye / as they that weary them selfs in these peculyer and
chosen works / which appear much shynynge and beautefull before men, for
their goodlye and outward life, with their manyfolde good works.

The saboth day.
AFter the spirytuall sense / this commandment has a more excellent work /
co^taynynge the hole nature of man. Saboth, in Hebrewe signyfyeth / holy,
rest, and quietness.
Here therefore must be known / that ye Saboth day after the Hebrewe tongue /
sygnifyeth, holy or rest / because that god rested and ceased the seventh day
from all his works / which he create ye six days before. Genesis the
second chapter. Therefore god commanded, that we should sanctifye the saboth
day / and cease from all our works / which we work ye six days. This
saboth day is now changed into the sunday / and the other days be called
profane or workedayes. But the sunday is called, the day of quietness or
rest, or the holy day. And I would to god, that there were no holy day i^
chrystendome but the sunday / so that the feasts of our lady and al other
saints were changed into the sunday / for so should much vice be exchued and
left through ye workedayes / and the countries should not be so oppressed
with penury. But now we be so laden with ye multitude of holidays / that it
is dystruccyon / both of souls, body, and goods / of the which many things
might be spoken. Furthermore this rest from works is two manner of ways /
There ben two manner of sabotes.
bodily and spirytually / so this commandment is here understand / two manner
of ways / for the bodily saboth day or rest / The bodily saboth.
is, of the which / we have spoken before / as the ceasynge fro our craft or
labor / in time conuenyent to se mass / to here the word of god / and to
pray all together for the common welthe of all men / ye which bodily saboth
day is not commanded to christen men / in so much that the apostell to ye
Collossyans the.ii. chapter, says. Let no man therefore trouble your
conscience about meat or drink / or for an pease of an holy day, as the holy
day of the new moon / or of the sabothe day / which are nothing but
shadows of things to come / but the body is Christ. Now verily the truth
is fulfilled / so that every day is holy day / as Esaye says the. 6.6.
chapter. And the month shall be of the month / and the saboth day / of the
saboth day. And again all days be profane and workedayes. But yet this
saboth day is necessary and ordained of christen people / for the profane
and lay men / for crafts men / laborers and hired servants / that they may
come together / to here the word of god / for as we se / the priests and
monks daily sacryfyce and say mass / pray every hour / and exercise them
self in the word of god / by studyeng, readyng, or hearing. For the which
cause they be without labor in comparyson to other / their rentes and pensyons
increased and provided for / having daily holidays, daily doing the works
of ye holidays / without all work days / and to whom all days be
indyfferent. So if we were all perfyte, and knew the gospel / we might daily
ayther work and labor / or if we would rest and keep holy day if we might /
for the saboth day is not now necessary nor commanded / but to learn the
word of god, and to pray.

The spirytuall saboth which ought to be hallowed every day
THe spirytuall holy day, which god has specially commanded in this
commandment is / that not only we labor not, and leave our occupacyon / but
much more that we suffer god only to work in us / workynge nothing of our
own, in all our power / but how should that be? Thus it is, man corrupt with
sin / has much evil love and desire to al sins / as the scripture
says. Genesis the.viii. cha. All the thought of man's heart is given to
evil at all times / that is, to pride, dysobedyence, The spirytuall saboth is
to rest and cease from all ye works of our old Adam, to mortefye thapetytes
of our corrupt nature, and to put on Jesus Christ, and all his works.
ire, hate, couetyse, uncleanness. And to be short in all things yt he does or
leaves undone. He seaketh more his own profit and pleasure / than the glory
of god or his neighbor / so that al his works, all his thoughts, and all his
life / is ill and not godly. Therefore to the end yt god may work in him / all
these vices and malyces must be dystroyed and plucked up / yt here may spring
the rest and ceasyng of our works, thoughts, words, and life, that
hereafter, not we / but as saint Paul says to the Galatianes the first
chapter. Christ may work, live and speak in us. But this is not done with
pleasant days / but we must do vyolence to nature, and suffer / ye vyolence
be done unto it / for here begins the battle between the spirit and the
flesh / here the spirit wrasteleth against ire / voluptuousnes, and pride /
the flesh willing to flow full of pleasure, honor, ydelnes, and rest /
of the which speaks saint Paul to the Galatianes / the.v. chapy. They that
be of Christ, has crucyfyed their flesh, with appetytes and lusts. Out of
this saboth therefore follow good works / to fast, to watch, to pray, to
labor / of the which, many men speak and write so much, and yet they know
another the begynnnge nor end of them. The spirytuall saboth is kept two manner
of ways.
And therefore at this time we shall speak of them. This holy day which god
works in us, when our works cease / is kept two manner of ways. First by
our own exercise / seco^darely by another outward exercysynge or mocyon.
Therefore our exercise must be so ordered / that first we se whereunto our
flesh is given / and to what our will and reason provoke us / and that we
resyst them and follow them not / as the wise man says, do thou not go after
thine own lusts and appetytes / and Deuteronomye the.xii. chapter. Do that
only that I command the / and thou shalt put nothing to the lord, nor
take nothing away. Here a man must have the prayers ever in use / which
Dauyd prayed, saying. Lord bring me in the way of thy commandments / and
not into couetyce. Item show me thy ways / and teach me thy paths / yt my
steps be not moved, and such many / the which all this prayer conteyneth.
Lord let thy kingdom come / for there be so many and so manyfold appetytes
and lusts / and sometime so subtle and goodly by the suggestion of the evil
spirit / that it is impossible for a man to rule him self in his life. Let
him therefore forsake hands and fete, and put him self / to the rule of god /
trustyng nothing in his own reason / as Hieremye says. Lord the way of man
is not in his own power. And that was fygured, when ye children of Israel went
out of Egypt / where they had no way / no meat, no drink, nor help. Therefore
god went before them by day time in a clear cloud / but at night in a fyerye
pyllar / nourysshyng them with aungelles food / from heaven / so keeping their
shoes and clothes / that they were not torn / as it is red in the books of
Moses. And therefore let us pray / lord let thy kingdom come / that thou
may rule us, and not we our selfs / For there is nothing more perilous i^
us / than our own propre will and reason. And this is the cheyf and highest
work / of god, and the best exercise to leave our own works / and to be
void fre and idle from all our own will and reason / committing our self to
god in all things / specially / where as spirytuall and good things appear.

AFter this spirytuall exercise follows the exercise of the flesh / to kill
his evil and gross desires / to make rest and quietness, which we must
kill with fasting, Here learn of fasting, watchyng, with other labors and
exercise of ye body, wherefore they serve, and for what intent they should be
done.
watchyng, and labor. Out of the which ground we learn how much / and
wherefore we ought to fast, watch, and labor. For there be many blind men
(alas for sorrow) that fast, watch, and labor, only for this cause / that
they think they be good works in them self / and that they deserve many
things in them / and so contynuynge in such things so long / that
otherwhyles they dystroye their own bodies, and make them selfs desye in the
heads. But yet they be more blind / which measure not only their fast after
their multitude or greatness / but also after ye meats thin king that it is
much better if they eat not flesh, eggs, or butter. And yet of all other
they be worse / that fast for saints and chose days / as wha^ one fasteth
wednysday, and another saturdaye / and he fasteth for saint Barbara, and
another for saint Sebastyan, and such other. All these seek none other thing
in fasting, but the work in it self / by the which they think they do well.
I here wyttyngly pass over many, which so fast fro meat / that yet they
drink till they be dronken / some eat fysshe, and other deintyes so costly
when they fast / yt they might eat flesh, eggs, and butter far better
cheap / but such manner of fasting / is no fasting / but rather a mock both
to fasting and to god / therefore I would ye every man should chose what day,
what meat, and how much he would fast / after his own mind / so yt he
there rest not / but let him mark the state of his flesh / and so fast
watch and labor / that he tame the fearsnes and wantones of it / and never
the more that the pope / bishop / church / goostly father, or any other man
commanded it / For the manner and rule of fasti^g watchynge and labor / is to
be taken of no man / another after ye multitude of meats or days / but after
the increasynge or dyscreasynge of the concupyssence and outragyousnes of ye
flesh / and for to kill and oppress them / fastings / watches / and labor
was ordained / and for none other cause / for if there were no such desires,
it were as good to eat / as to fast, to sleep, as to watch, to be ydell, as
to labor / and one as good as another, without all dyfference.

IF therefore a man perceive and find / that there grows more fearsnesse in
his flesh, by eating of fysshe / than by eggs and flesh. He than ought
to eat flesh and no fysshe. And again if he feale his head to be corrupt,
and his body and his stomach to be weak with fasting / or that he has no
neade to oppress the fearsnesse of his flesh let him leave fasting,
eating, slepynge, resting, as much as he has need for ye health of his
body / not lokynge whether it be against the commandments of the church /
her order or decre / for there is no commandment of the church, nor
constytucyons of any order / that may ordain and prescrybe fastings,
watchynges, and labor, more straytelye, than they profit to tame and
mortyfye the voluptuous desires of the flesh. But where soever (without this
purpose and end) they command fasting, meats, sleep, and watches, more
hardely than the flesh may suffer / or more than is neade to the killing of
the lust of the flesh / so that nature is corrupt and the head lost / than
let no man think that he has done a good work / excusing him self, other
by the commandments of the church / or else by the constytucyons of his
order / for he shall seem to have wanted to him self / and as much as lay in
him to be a mansleyer and stryker of him self. No truly, the body is not
given to kill his natural life or work / but only to oppress his fyersnesse
/ except the fyersnesse be so great / that it can not be resysted without the
hurt and loss of natural life. And as I said before, in the exercysynge of
fasting, watchynge and labor / a man must have an eye not to the work in it
self, not to ye days, multitude, or meats / but only to the fyers and
wanton Adam / so that the wantonness and fyersenesse may be taken from him.

OF these we may perceive how wyselye or folysshelye some woman great with
child do / and how sick men should be entreated. For folysshe women stycke
so to fastings, yt they will rather put both their birth, and them selfs
in ieoperdye / than they should not fast equally together with other me^ /
having conscience there where is none / and again, there as is conscience
having none. The cause of the which thing be prechers / prechynge, fastings,
so rasshelye and folysshelye / that they show never the truth / use, manner,
profit, cause, or end of it. So we should suffer the sick to eat and drink
daily what soever they will. And to be short, when the fearsnesse of the
flesh cease by and by / cease all the cause of fasting, watchynge,
labourynge, eating this meat or that, another is there / any other
commandment that co^pellyth or byndeth us to fast. And of the other side, we
must take heed least by this liberty / there grow a unlusty slothfulness of
ye flesh. Truth it is yt our old Adam is passing subtle in seeking his own
ease and pleasure, pretendynge ever this disease, or that disease to avoid
fasting, as ye ache of the head, weakness of body with such like. As there
be some / babbling that it is not necessary / that we should fast and
absteyne, willing yt we should eat this or yt without any fear at all times
/ as though they had been long / and much exercysed in fasting / and yet
truly they never tasted it. And no less we ought to avoid sclaunders before
them / which be not instruct and wise enough / but take it for a great
sin, if we do not both fast and eat together with them after their manner
and custom. And in deed such men should be instruct and taught swetely and
not dispysed cruellye / nor we should eat this or that for the dysdayne or
hate of them / but we must show a reason / why this may be well and laufull
ye done / and so they also by a little, and little, may be brought unto the
same understanding. But if they be so stubbornely froward yt they will here no
man. Than let them alone. and let us do that that we know to be good and right.

THe latter exercise which happens unto us, is wha^ we be hurt, other by
me^ or by ye devil, wha^ we be spoiled other of goods, or riches, when the
body is sick / when honor is taken from us / and what seeuer moves us to
impacyency, wrath, and unquietness. For as ye work of god rules in us after
his wisdom, and not after our own reason, after his clennes / and not after
the fyersnes of our flesh. For charity and wisdom be the works of god / but
folysshenesse and uncleanness be our works, from ye which we must absteyne
/ so he ought to rule in us after his peace, and not after our ire, impacyence
and war For peace also is the work of god / but impacyency is yt work of
our flesh, which must be left and mortyfyed. Wherefore to mortyfye such our
works and the old Adam / god lays upon our necks many aduersyties /
mouynge us to wrath / many passions provoking us to impacyence / and at last
death and sclau^der of the world / seeking no other thing by this means, but
that ire, impacyence and war driven out of us, he might come to his work,
that is to say / to peace in us. So says Esaye ye xxviii. chapter. His
work is strange, that he may work his work, that is to say / he sends us
passions, war, and debate that he may learn us to have pacyence and peace. He
commands to dye that he may quycken / until a man be so exercysed, so
pacyfyed and so quyete / that he be nothing moved in prosperytie nor in
aduersytie, whether he live or dye / whether he be honored or sclaunderyd /
than there works god only / thanne is there no man's work / than this shall
be called the true sabothe day / tha^ a man is not led of him self / than he
follows not his own will, than is he troubled in no thing / but god his
self guydeth him. Than there is plainly the will of god, peace and myrthe with
all other good works and virtues.

GOd settyth so much by these works / that he commanded not only the saboth
to be observed and called saboth day / but that it should be sanctified or
judged holy / so showing that there is nothing better, nothing more precious /
than to suffer al troublous. For they be the relyques, the holy things that
consecrate or holowe a man from his own works / to the works of god / as the
temple is consecrate from all natural works to the worship of god. And
therefore let a man knowledge the^ as worshypfull relyques / ioynynge and gyuyng
thanks to god if they come. For wha^ they come / they so sanctifye a man, that
he does the co^maundent of god / and is made safe and de^yuerde from all his
sins, so says Dauyd / ye death of his saints is precious in the sight of
the lord. And to ye end that god might bolden and quickenvs to these things
/ he has not only commanded us the keeping of the saboth day (for it is
greatly against nature to dye and to suffer to rest and be dead from her own
works). But also he comforts us by manyfolde words in scripture / saying
to us the.89. psalm. I shall be present with him in trybulacion, I shall
defend him and indue him with dygnytie. Also ye.xxxiii. psalm full nyghe is
the lord to men broken i^ the heart / he saves the contryte in spirit / nor
he was content with this / but he has given us a mighty and strong example /
his only sone Jesus our lord / which all the hole sabothe day lay void,
and without al his works / as pertaynyng to ye manhood / and first of all men
fulfilled his co^mau^dment / for no need of him self, but only for our
comfort / that we in all our sufferynges / yea even in death / might be quyete
and at rest / and having peace, lokynge upon Christ / reased up again after
his rest and sabothe day / day thensforth living in only god, and god in
him. And so we after the mortyfyenge of our Adam / which shall not be fully
until the honor of death, shall be raised up in god / yt god may work and
live in us for evermore. Lo these be the three parts of man / reason, pleasure,
and heaviness / in the which all his works go forth / which must be mortyfyed
by these three exercysynges / ye rule or gouernyng of god / our chasty synges
and outward hurtes / that so we keeping a sabothe day spirytuall, may give pla
/ ce to the works of god.

But such works and sufferynges must be done in faith and good trust of
gods love / A recapulacyon of all yt is gone before, which concerns the
first table of commandments.
yt all works may abide in ye first commandment and faith, as is said before
/ and ye faith may exercise and strength her self in them / for the which
thing be all the other works and commandments ordained. Mark therefore how
goodlye a gold ring is made / of these three commandments / and their
works / and how out of the first commandment and faith, ronneth the second
in to the third / and again ye third by the second / enters in to the
first / for the first work is to believe, and have a good heart and trust in
god / out of this spryngeth the second good work / which is to praise the
name of god, to confess his grace, and to ascrybe and give all glory to him
only. Than after follows the third work / yt is the worshype or service of
god / to exercise thy self in prayer / in hearing of sermondes, in remembryng
the benefytes of god. Also to chastyse him self and to tame his flesh. The
devil therefore seeing such faith, glory, and worshype of goo / waxes mad,
beginning persecucyon coming upon our body, goods, honor, and life / and
puts unto us syckenes, sclau^der, and death / god so sufferyng and ordeynyng
him. Lo than begins ye ii. work, or.ii. saboth day of the iii.
commandment / whereby faith is meruaylouslye proved, even as gold in a
fornayse. For it is a great thing to keep good trust to god / yea wha^ he
sends death, sclau^der, syckenes, and poverty: and yet nevertheless in such
a fearful Image of death to count him for a most meke and gentyl father / the
which thing must be in the work of this third commandment / where
sufferyng co^pelieth faith, to call upon the name of god, and to praise him in
such sufferynges / and so again turns the third commandment in to ye
second. And by the praysyng and calling upon ye name of god, ryseth faith /
coming again in to her self / and stablysshyng her felfe by two works of
the second and third commandment / so faith goes out in to works, and by
works comes again to her self. Like as the son rysynge i^ the East,
goes to the Weest / after that retouryng again to the East. Day.
For the which cause the day in holy scripture is properly lykened unto the
works of a quyte and peasable life. Night.
But the night is lykened to ye sufferynge life, oppressed with trouble and
aduersytie. And so faith lives and works in both these lives / goes out
and comes in, as Christ says in the.vi. chapi. of John^.

Se here how the order of the.x. commandments ben observed in our Pater
noster.
WE pray for this order of good works in our Pater noster, in ye which, the
first thing that we say, is our father which art in heaven, which be the
words of the first work of faith / which by the tenoure of the first
commandment doubts not / but yt she has a good and merciful father in
heaven. Secondely, hallowed be thy name / by the which, faith desires the name,
praise, and glory of god to be showed / calling upon the name of god in all
aduersytie. Thyrdly, let thy kingdom come, whereby we do pray / for the true
and laufull saboth day / and rest from our works, that the work of god be
only in us / and that Christ may so reygne in us / as in his kingdom, as he
him self said. Verily I say unto you / the kingdom of god is no where but
within you. The fourth peticyon is. Thy will be fulfilled, in the which we
pray, that we may keep and do the seven commandments of the second table /
in the which and by the which, faith is exercysed to our neighbors / as in
these three first / she is exercysed in works toward god. And these three
prayers, in the which ben these pronounce / thou thine / seek nothing else but
that, that belongs to god, but al other prayers say, ours, to us and for us.
etc. For we pray there for our gooddes and for our health. Hitherto have we
spoken of the first table of Moses / and truly the more grosely to show the
chyef good works unto the simple. Now therefore follow the second table.

The first commandment of the second table / honor thy Fyther and thy
mother.
WE learn of this commandment, ye next the high works of the.iij. first
co^maundeme^^es / there is no better work than obedyence and service unto them
which be ordained to be our superyours. And therefore disobedyence is a
greatter sin tha^ manslaughter, uncleanness, theft, and disceyte / and what
soever may comprehend in it. For we can know no better ye difference of
sins, How to know the greatness of one sin above another.
which is greatter one tha^ the other / than by ye order of gods
commandments. Howbete one and every co^mu^deme^t by him self has
distere^ce i^ his work / for who is he yt knows not / yt to curse and ba^ne,
is more grievous than to be angrye / and to stryke is worse tha^ to curse / and
to stryke father or mother / is worse, than to stryke any other of ye common
people? Therefore these.x. commandments teach us how we ought to exercise
good works to uore neighbor / and first to our supery ours. The honor of
father and mother.
The first work is to honor our bodily father and mother The which honor
stands not in this only, that we show our selfs godly in our gesture / but
that we apply and obey them and have their words reverently in our iyes,
setting much by them, and regarding them, following the^, holdyng our peace
and sufferynge them, how soever they entreat us, when it is not against the
three first commandments. And moreover if they have need we must provide
the^, meat, clothyng, and house. For it is not for naught yt god said, honor
them / he said not love the^ / how be it that love is also required / but
honor is higher tha^ syngle love, Honor is above love.
for it has a certain fear growing together with love, causyng a man to
fear more the displeasure. tha^ the punysshement. Even as we worship
relyques with fear / and yet we fle not fro them as from punysshement / but
rather approach more nyghe them / such fear myngled with love is true
honor. What honor is.
For there is another fear without love, to those things which we dispyce or
fle from. As from manquellers or punyssheme^t, and there is no honor. For it
is fear without all love / yea it is a fear joined with hatred and envy / of
the which is a proverb of saint Hierome, saying / that, that we fear we
hate? with such fear will god another be feared nor honored / nor yet our
father nor mother / but with ye first fear, to whom is love and trust joined.

THis work seems light and easy, but few esteem it worthily. For where as
the father and mother be good, loving their children, not with carnal love /
but as they be bound to holiness and the worshyppyng of god, bringing them
up / and teaching them in the three first commandments: there is always the
chyldes own will broken. So that he is compelled to forsake and to suffer
that, that his nature would not / whereby he fyndeth a cause to despyce his
father and his mother / and to grudge against them / or to go about and do
worse things. There than goes away both love and fear, except the grace
of god help. Likewise wha^ the father and mother correct and chaste their
children as they deserve / yea other whiles more than they deserve (the which
thing yet is no let to the souls health) than the froward nature takes such
chastesynge with dysdayne. Moreover there be some of such ungracious
disposicyon / that they be a shamed of ye poverty, love, birth, deformytie,
or sclau^der of their father and mother, sufferyng them self to be moved more
with such things / than with this high commau^deme^t of god / ye is above all
thing / which by his great counsel, has given the^ such father and mother to
prove and exercise the^ in his commandment. But this is much stronger wha^
ye children be at lyberte / for tha^ love going down, there is much love
taken away from ye father and mother: whatsoever is commanded and said of our
father and mother / that must be understand also of them yt be in ye stead of
our father and mother when they be dead or absent / as be our kynsfolke, our
godfarthers / temporal rulers, and spirytuall fathers. For every man must be
ruled of other men, and be under them. Wherefore we se here also, how many good
works is taught in this commandment / in as much as all our life is subject
unto other men. Hense it comes, that obedyence is so greatly praised, and
that it comprehe^deth all virtues and good works in it.

Against evil bryngyng up of children.
THere is another sclaunder against the father and mother, much more subtle and
peryllous than ye first / which is garnysshed and set forth for right and true
honor. And that is when the child lives after his own mind and will / his
father and mother sufferynge him to do it. Here is honor, here is love, but it
is but beastlye of both pertyes. Here the father and the mother please the
child, and the child again pleases the father and the mother. This
punysshement is so open and common, that there be very seldom examples seen
of the first sclaunder / which thing happens because that the father and
mother be blinded, and another know nor worshype god in the first
commandments. And for this cause, they can not se what thing their children
lack / and how they should be taught and brought up. And so they bring the^
up to profane and worldly honors and riches / yt they may only please men /
and by all means to be exalted and made great men. This thing is pleasant to
ye children / into this they be obedyent without any gain saying. So the
commandments of god, under ye color of goodness go to wreake / and yt is
fulfilled: which is written by ye prophets, Esaye, and Hieremye / that the time
should come, when ye children should be dystroyed by their own fathers and
mothers. After the example of king Manasses which suffered his sone to offer,
do sacryfyce, and burn beasts to ye ydoll Moloch. For I pray you, what other
thing is this / than the child to do sacryfyce and offer to an ydolle / when
the father and mother bring them up more to ye love of the world, tha^ of
god / sufferyng the^ to be carried after their own will, in the pleasures of ye
world / to be set a fire with the love, mirth, goods and honor of this world
/ and the love and glory of god, and the pleasure of everlasting goods to be
quenched and clean put out in the^? O how great ieoperdye is it to be a father
and mother, where as nothing reygneth but flesh and blood? For it stands
holy i^ this commandment / yt the three first and six last be known and
kept. In as much, as it is commanded to ye father and mother to teach their
children those things as it is in ye.77. psalm. He gave his commandment
unto Iacobe / and put his law into Israel, wha^ he commanded the fathers to
declare these things to their children / yt their posteryte might know them
/ and yt their children when they be waxen up, might show ye same to their
children also. And this is the cause why god has commanded to honor thy
father and mother / that is, to love them with fear / for love without fear
is more sclau^der than it is honor. Now mark therefore whether al men have
enough good works to do, or not. Whether soever they be fathers and mothers,
or they be children. But we be so blind, that we let this alone and seek for
other works not commanded.

WHere than as the father and mother be so folysshe, that they bring up their
children wantonly and worldly / the children in no wise should obey them / for
god is more to be set by in the three first commandments, than our father
and mother. I call wa^tonly and worldly bryngyng up / wha^ they teach us not
more to seek and follow god / than the pleasures, honors, riches, and power of
this world / to wear laufull and clean raiment / and look for honest goods /
is necessary and no sin. So yet that ye child be so taught in his heart that
at the least in the putting on and wearynge of his apparel, The true
wearyng of apparel.
he sorrow and lament the wretchedness of this life in earth, that it can not
well be begone, nor passed over, without much more raiment and riches than neade
requires / to hill and cover the body / to keape away the cold / and get a
living so / that he shall be constrained against his will to play the fool /
for the favor of the world, and suffer this evil for a better thing to
exchue the worse. The spirytualtie never read this text of Hestor.
Thus the queen Hester did wear her crown, saying unto god / thou know my
necessytie yt I abhor the sign of pride and my glory, which is upon my
head, in the days of my bostynge / and I dysdayne it, as the clothe of a
menstruate woman / and the which I will not bear in ye days of my silence,
what soever heart therefore is thus armed / may wear all manner of garments
without all ieoperdy / for he wears them, and wears the^ not / he plays of
ye instruments and plays not / he lives gloryouslye, and not gloryously.
And these be the preuy souls and secret spouses of Christ / but they be very
scarce. For it is very hard, not to delight in goodly rayme^t and bostynge. So
saint Cecyle by the commandment of her father and mother, did wear clothe of
gold / but under yt she ware hear. But here will some say / yea sir, but how
than shall I mary my daughter honorably? Am I not in such a case compelled to
boste my self? But I pray the tell me / be not these the words of a heart
mystrustynge god, and trusting more in his own proper wisdom / than in the
cure and prouysyon of god? All though saint Peter teaches us, and says /
cast all your care on him for he cares for you / yea it is a token, that
such men did never give god thanks for their children / neither have truly
prayed or commended them unto his goodness. Or else they should know and prove
how they ought to ask and desire of god / that they might marye their
daughters. Therefore god suffers them to their own wit, care and benefytes
/ and not to end their business conuenyently.

SO true is that, yt is commonly said / ye father and mother may get heaven i^
their own children / if they had nothing else to do. For in ye bryngyng up of
them to the worship of god / they have both their hands full (as ye man
says) to do good works. For what be the hungry, thyrstye, naked, prisoners,
sick, and strangers / but the souls of thy children, A christen man's house
is an hospytall.
of ye which god has made thine house an inn or an hospytall / making ye to
them as ye master of the hospytall / that thou should keape them / feade
them / give them meat and drink / with good works and words? that they may
learn to trust in god, to believe and fear him, and to put their hope in him,
worshypyng his name / not sweryng nor cursynge, chastysynge them selfs /
prayenge, fasting, watchynge, laboring, and to serve god and his word / and
to keep his sabothe day, that they may learn to despise te^porall things / to
suffer pacyently aduersytie / not to fear death, and not to love this life. Lo
how great busynes these be. Lo how many good works thou haste at home, in thy
child that lacks all such things / as the soul being hungrye, thyrsty,
naked, poor, prysoned, and sick. O how blessed a thing is matrymony. O how
happy be those houses in the which dwell such fathers and mothers. For they
be the very true temple and elect abbay of god / yea rather a Paradyse / of
the which is spoken.127. psalm. Blessed be he, who soever honors the
lord, and walks in his ways. Thou shalt eat the labors of thy own
hands / and shalt have prosperous increase. Thy wife shall be fruteful as the
vine tree / wtin the walls of thy house / thine children shall stand about the
table, like the plants of Olyue trees. Lo thus shall that man be blessed,
which worship the lord / the lord shall bless the from Syon / and thou
shalt delight, beholdynge the prosperyte of Jerusalem all days of thy life /
and thou shall se thy chylders children / and ye felycytie of Jerusalem. Where
be such fathers and mothers / where be they that ask for good works? no man
comes hither. Therefore (I say) god has commanded that thing / from the
which the devil / our flesh and blood pulls us. It is not goodly in the
sight of ye world / and therefore it is not set by. But one ronneth to saint
James / and another voweth him self to our lady. And no man voweth him self to
the glory of god / and to rule and teach well him self and his children / he
forsakes them, whom he has taken to keep by the commandment af god / and
labors to serve god other ways / where he has no commandment / there
is no bishop yt resysteth such froward manners / no precher rebukes these
things / ye rather they stablysshe such things / inuentynge daily mo
pylgrymages, canonysynge of mo saints, and selling of perdons. I pray god
therefore to have mercy on such blyndnesse.

ANd again upon the other side, the father and the mother do not sooner deserve
hell / than in their own children at home, wha^ they lack to them not
teaching the^ these things which be spoken of before. For what does it
profit them, if they dye with fasting, prayenge, going pilgrimage, and doing
all other good works. In as much god will not ask us of such things /
another at the time of death, nor at the last judgment? but will ask a
compte of our children committee to our custodye? This proves the saying of
christ, the.2.3. chapter of Luke. Ye women of Jerusalem weep not for me, but
for your selves, and for your children for lo ye time shall come, when they
shall say. Take heed al you that have householdes and children.
Happy be ye baren, and the wombes, which have not borne children, and the
breasts which have not given suck. Why should they so complain / but that
all their dampnacyon comes to them for their sons / which if they had
lacked, peradventure they should have been blessed. Trewely these words should
open the iyes of ye Fathers and mothers to look spiritually upon their children
lest the wretched children, should be deceived by the false carnal love of
their father and mother, wha^ they be not angrye with them because they obey
them after the common nature of the people / by the which things, their free
will is stablysshed and waxes strong / and yet the commandment of God
therefore commands us to honor our Father and our mother, that yt children
may be made low, demure, and meke / their free will broken and dystroyed.
Therefore as it is said in the other commandments, that the works must be
so observed, that they proceed out of the first work, even so here / let no
man think that the ordering and bringing up of his children is suffycyent of
it self / but if it be done in the grace and favor of god / so that a man
doubts nothing of it / but that he pleases god in all such works.
Therefore let these works be nothing else to a man but signs and exercysynges
of faith to trust in God / and to have a surenesse in his grace, and lyberall
will. For without this faith no work other lives / or is good and pleasant
to god.

For many of the Hethens, and gentylles have brought up their children well /
but that did profit them nothonge, because of their vabeleue.

THe second work of this commandment is to honor our spiritual mother
holy church, and the ecclesyastycall power, co^maundynge, forbydgynge,
ordeynynge, making, cursynge, or absoluynge. In all these we must obey them
and as we honor, love, and fear our bodily fathers and mothers, even so we
must obey the spyrytuall power in all things, which be not contrary to the
three first commandments of god. But in this work, the matter is far i^
worse case, tha^ in the first. For it would become the ecclesyastycall power to
punysshe sins by exco^munycacyon / cursynge, and laws / and to compel their
spirytual persons to goodness / that they might have a cause to do good works,
and to exercise them selfs to obedyence / and gyuyng honor to the power. But
we se that the spirytuall power takes no head at all to keep their children in
their office / but so to deal with their people and subjects, as mothers
following their lovers. As it is said in the.ij. chap. of Ozee. They preach
not, they teache not, they resyste not, they rebuke not, they punysshe not / and
to be short there is no ecclesyastycall gouernynge left in all chrystendome.
What than should I speak in this work? There be left yet some fastyngdayes,
and holy dayed / which it were better to anulle / but no man cares for that.
So there is no thing that flouryssheth now / but exco^munycacyon, for duetyes
accustomed / the which thing ought not to be. But the power of the church
should se that adulterye, uncleanness, glotonye, pride, unmeasurable ryote of
all thing, and such other vices be punysshed and let. And also that ye
colleges, and abbeyes, parysshes, and scoles be well ordered / and ye gods
service be holely kept in the^. And that the young both men and maids in the
scoles and abbeys have good and co^nynge men provided to teach them, that they
may be well brought up / that the old may profit ye young by good example /
and that the children and common wealth may be filled and garnysshed with goodly
youth. For so saint Paul taught his discyple Titus / yt he should teach well
and govern all degrees and estates, young and old men and women. But now we
live every man after his own will, every man teaches him self, yea (alas for
sorrow) it is come to the point / that the places in the which goodness should
be taught, be now made scoles of vanyties, so that no man takes head of
outrageous youth

IF every thing were ordered after this manner, than a man might show how
honor and obedyence ought to be done to ecclesiastyke persons. But it is now
with them, as it is with bodily fathers and mothers, which suffer their
children to much after their own mind and will / and ecclesyastycall power,
does now grant and dyspence / and for money pardons more than it may
pardone. Here I will let many things pass yt I might speak of / for I se moo
things than be well. Couetyse sytteth and governs, and the church teaches
that, that it should forbid. And besides these, it is open to every man's iyes /
that the living of the spyrytualtie is much more vngoodlyer and vyler / than
the life of the lay or seculer men. Wherefore the chrystyan common welthe must
needs be dystroyed / and this commandment subverted. For where there were
such a bishop, as would take heed, vysyte, look upon, and go about all
such orders and degrees, with so great dylygence and labor, as he is bound
/ truly one city were to much for him. For in the time of the apostles /
when the church was most stourysshynge / every city had one bishop,
although the last part of the world, was not than chrystened. How thanne
should it be well among men / when one bishop will have thus much / another
so much, the third chalengeth half ye world / and the fourth would have
all the world under his rule? Therefore it is now time to pray to god for
grace. For we have ecclesyastycall power enough / but as for ecclesyastycall
gouernyng we have little or none. In the mean time, he that knows might
help / that ye colleges or priests abbeys, and parysshes, and scoles / were
well ruled and governed. For this also is the ecclesyastycall power, to make
fewer colleges, abbeys, and scoles where as no profit comes of them. Truly
it is better to have no colleges nor abbeys at all, than to have evil rule or
order in them, whereby god is grievously offended.

Therefore when the superyours be froward, and suffer their office to decay, it
must neades follow that they abuse their power, setting forth outward evil
works, both them self and to ye people / none otherwise tha^ the father and
mother, if they command any thing contrary unto god. Here therefore we must
beware and wise. For the apostell showed before, that such peryllous times
should come / in the which such superyours or officers should rule. Yet such
superyours have this cloak to cover their iniquity withal / to bear men in
hand that they repyne and resyste the power of god / if at any time what
soever they statute or ordain, be undone or let. Therefore let us than take in
our hands the three first commandments of god / and the right table, being
sure that no man, another bishop nor pope / no nor angels, may ordain or
command any thing contrary / dysagreinge or repungnyng to ye three first
commandments and their works. But if they go about ye contrary, it is
naught worth another byndeth any man. And we also do sin obeyeng such
commandments and constytucyo^s / either doing the^ or twynkelyng at them. By
this a man may lightly perceive / how that sick me^ be not bound with the
commandments of fasting / another women great with child / another they yt
may not fast for any other cause without hurt. And yt we may search this matter
more groundelyer / There is nothing now yt comes from Rome / but ye mart
and fair of all things of ye church, which be openly bought and sold with out
any shame / as perdo^s, perysshes abbeys, dioces, prelacy, benefyces, and what
soever was made and ordained in any place to the honor of god. By reason
whereof all the riches, goods, and money of all the world, be not only driven
to Rome / which were but a little loss. But also parysshes, dyoces, and
prelacy, be pulled, forsaken, and wasted. So that Gods people is despised and
lost / the word, name and glory of god, be trod under fete faith is
dystroyed. and all to the end that such colleges and offices, may be given
not only unto unlearned, folysshe, and unworthy / but also to Rome ronners, the
chief heddes of al noughtye packes in the world. And so those things that
were founded to the worship of god, to the finding of prechers, which should
rule and correct the peonowe spente upon horses, horse kepers, and moyles /
Yea and if I may speak somewhat unshamefastly / upon the whores and also whore
hunters of Rome / of whom yet we have no kyndnes, but be mocked unto our
tethes like fools.

Seeing therefore ye all these intolerable folysshenes be done under ye name of
god and saint Peter (as though ye ecclesyastycall power were ordained to have
ye glory of god in shame and mockyng, and to distroye chrystyan common wealth
both of body and soul.) We ought undoubtedly to resyste them, as much as
we may. For here we must follow the example of good children / whose fathers
be mad. And first of all we must look from whense this law came / that
such things as were ordained founded and given to ye worshyppyng of god and
bringing up of our own children / should return to ye use, service, and
profit of them that lie at Rome, and nothing to be done in the mean time
here at home where it were most mete and co^uenye^t, Why be we so mad The
bysshoppes and the chief of the church be here so slack / yt they do not
only not resyst such things / but also they fear, lest other would resyst,
and so they suffer yt chyrstyan common welthe to perysshe. First of al let us
mekely call upon god / tha^ let us set upon to redress these myscheuous with
hand / stop the messyngers of Rome their way / showing the^ lowly and
gentylly / that if they would rule their benefyces / they should be resydent
upon them / feadyng the people with preaching and good example, which thing if
they will not do / or else lie at Rome or other places, pyllyng and polling ye
parysshes. Let ye pope or other find the^ to whom they do service. For it is
not mete yt we should find the bishop of Rome / his officers or co^mynaltie
/ ye rather his bawes and whores, with the loss and undoing of our souls. Lo
these be the very Turks / whom kings, princes and gentylmen / should first
invade / not for hope or remembrance of their private wealth, but for the love
only of Christ's common wealth / and to let the sclaunders hurtes / and
blasphemye of the name of god. How the bysshopp of Rome ought to be handeled
with all his wha^ they be^ out of the way.
Thus therefore must such spyrytuall persons be handeled and regarded as a
mad father / which except he be taken and let (which thing yet must be
with fear and reverence.) may destroy both children and patrymonye, and all
that he has. So truly should we take the power of Rome honorably, as (...)
father / but when they be mad and wood / they must be let from their purpose
/ least by that the common welthe of Christ be undone.

THere be some that think, that this should be referred to a general counsel
/ but I say it is not to be done. For we have had many counsels, in the which
this matter has been had in hand / and especyally in the counsel of Constance
Basyll / and the last at Rome / but yet there is nothing fynysshed, so yt it
is ever worse and worse. Another do such counsels profit any thing syns that
the wisdom of Rome has ymagyned this inuencyon / that kings and princes
must be first bound by an oath / that they shall suffer them still to poscesse
and keep that, that they have without any dysturbance. Such requests and
condycyons has the bishop of Rome yt now is, Clement the.vii. made to ye
princes of Germany / yea and much worse, for a general counsel to be had.
And so they lay a bar and a stop to withstand all reformacyons, and to
defend their liberty and license of all ungodliness. Albeit such an oath
made by vyolynce against god and right / lets the holy ghost, which
(they say) bears the rule in such counsels. But this were the best and
only remedy that is left. If kings, princes, gentylmen, cytyes, and
vniuersyties, would take ye matter in hand to reform it their selfs, and so
handle it / that ye bishops and spyrytualtie fearyng their cause / should have
an occasion to follow. For here is nothi^ge to be regarded: but ye first
commandments of god / against the which, another pope, nor heaven / nor earth
may forbid or command any thing, another is there any ieoperdie in cursinges or
thretenynges / whereby they go about to let a laufull redressyo^. No More the^
it does no hurt if ye furyous father, greatly threten his sone, yt holds him
/ and let him fro his mad doing.

THe third work of this commandment is / to obey the temporal or seculer
power, as Paul teachyth to the Romans, the.13. chapitre / and to Titus the
first chapter / and saint Peter in his first epistle the.2. chapitre saying
Submyt your selfs unto all men / other to the king, as chief / or to his
officers as sent of him, to the punysshement of all ill doers / but for ye
praise of well doers. The office of ye te^porall or seculer power is to defend
their commons and subjects / to punysshe theft, brybery, and adultery / as
saint Paul says to ye Romans the.13. chapyt. The high power bears not a
sword for naught But he is the mynystre of god to take ve^geau^ce of them yt
do evil: but to do good to the^ / yt be good / Here than we sin.ii. manner of
ways. First when we deceive the seculer power, other by lyeng deceyte / or
unfaithfulness / and again when we obey them not, bidding, or co^maundynge
us any thing / whyther it must be done with body or goods. For though they
do unjustly / as the king of Babylon did to ye chyldre of Israel: yet god
would yt we should obey them / without all disceyte or any begyle. Secondarely,
when we backebyte them / and when we be angrye and can not be avenged, when we
grudge against them, or hurt them with evil words privily or openly. In all
these things we must regard that, that saint Peter commands us to regard
/ and specially that their power can not hurt our souls, but only our
bodies and goods / except they openly compel us to do against god, or
unjustly against men / as the Heathen princes compelled many Chrystyanes,
before they came into Christ's relygyon. And as it is said, the Turk does
now a days / for to suffer wrong hurts not the soul, but makes it better,
though it takes somewhat from the body or goods. But unrighteous doing
dystroyeth the soul / yea though thou get all the good of the world.

ANd this is ye cause, yt there is not so great peril in the seculer power
when it does ill / as in the spirytuall or ecclesyastycall power. For the
seculer or temporal power can not hurt / in as much as they meddyll not with
preaching and sermons, and with faith / and the three first commandments
of god. But the ecclesiastycall power hurts not only, doing
vnryghtwysenesse. But also when they leave their duetye, and do that that is
not their duetye / yea though it were better than the best works / that the
seculer power does. And therefore such men must be resysted wha^ they do
wro^ges / and not ye temporal powers / all though they live contrary to their
offices. For the poor common people so follow the ecclesyastycall power in
belefe and in life, that both they be blind as betelles, and know neither
what to believe, nor to do. Furthermore the ecclesyastycal power was ordained
for nothing else / but to bring the people by faith to god / the which
things be not in the temporal or seculer power. For whether the temporal
powers do these things or leave them undone after their own mind / yet my
faith goes forth nevertheless / her way workyng by it self / and not
compelled to believe by their example. Wherefore the temporal power is of very
little force before god to hurt any man's soul, and of much less reputacyon
and weight, than that for the evil life or good life of it, we should move any
sedicyon, dysobedyence, and debate. And again the spirytuall and
ecclesyastycall power is a great good and excellent thing, and of more high
value before god / than that the least christen man should suffer them / and
not to speak to the^, if they ones swerve one hear bread from their office. I
will not say, if they go utterly again their office / as we se now daily.

THere be many abuses in this te^porall or seculer power. First, when they yt
enjoy the dygnytie do follow the counsel of flatterers / which is a common
and meruaylous hurtefull dystruccyon and pestylence / and can not be avoided to
much. And in this point the officers be led (as men say) by the nose, to
ye great hurt and evil of the miserable people / because that where men be so
led, there is commonly such governance, as the Ethnyke speaks of. That
like as the spyder webbes be strong enough to hold fast flies, where as the
mylne stones brast through the^, and go their ways. Even so ye poor people be
holden with laws constytucyons, and rules / the great men scapynge and at
liberty. Therefore where as the lord or prince is not so wise by him self, so
bold and virtuous, that he needs not the counsel of other / there must
needs be (except god show a peculyar miracle) a chyldysshe rulynge and
governance. Therefore almighty god among all other plages and troubles,
nombreth and judges evil and folysshe officers, princes, and rulers / with
whom he thretened to punysshe ye people / Esaye the.iii. chap. I shall give
children to be their princes / and effamynate me^ shall have power over them.
And truly god in scripture has thretened four plages or punysshementes,
Esechiell the.xiii. chapy. The first is the pestylence most poisoned and
deadely, which Dauyd chose. The second hungre / the third sword or batell /
the fourth, evil beasts and lions, wolves, serpents, and dragons / whereby
be^ sygnyfyed evil governors. For where as such rulers be / ye country has
not myschefe and loss only in their bodies, goods, and riches, and all other
things / but also in fame, honor, lernyng, virtue, and in health of their
souls. For pestylence and hungre makes men good and ryghtwyse. But wars and
ill rulers loss and dystroye both all temporal goods perpetual.

IT is also the duetye of a synguler wise prince, not to punysshe always with
death, though he have never so good and just a cause. For it is much more
excellent virtue that he do harm or loss to his law / than to the goods or
bodies of his subjects, if it may be to the profit of his commons or
subjects. In asmoche as ye temporal laws regard only temporal things.
Therefore this is a folysshe saying, the law is with me in this matter /
wherefore with might and power I will revenge it and keep it / ye though all
other should be wrapped in ieoperdye and myschiefe. Octauian the emperor.
We read that the Emperor Octauyan would never more make any war, had he
never so right a cause / onelesse he were sure yt he should war for more
profit than hurt, or at ye lest with tolerable loss. In so much that he
was wont to say / that warryours were like them that fysshed with a golden hook
/ which when it is lost, can never be recompensed by taking of fysshe. For
he that leads a waggen, must needs go otherwise than he that goes a lone.
For he yt goes alone may keep this way and that way as he will / but the
caryer or carter must now turn this way / now that way, as his cart or
horses may follow him / whom he must regard and not his own will. So it is
necessary that a prince or a lord guydynge an hooste / go forth not after his
own mind, but by the power and co^modytie of his hooste / more regarding the
profit, need, and co^modytie of his company / than his own will and
pleasure. For a prince or a lord co^maundynge or rulynge after the mind and
lust of his own brain and folysshe head / is like a mad caryer or carter,
that dryueth horse and carte headelynge, through busshes and groves, dyches,
poddelles, waters, hills, and dales / and neither looks for ways nor brydges
/ such a carter shall not long carye but break his wagen all to pieces. And
therefore it were most profitable for princes and kings that they read, or else
cause to be read to them / even from their chyldhode. As well the stories of
scripture, as of the gentylles / for they should find more learning, and more
examples, to rule and govern in them / tha^ in all the books of law and
decrees / as we read in the reygne of the king of Persie, in the.vi. chapter
of Hesters. For we be ever taught more by examples and stories, than by laws,
decrees, and constytucyons, because that in such examples and hystoryes / sure
experyence teaches us, and here bare words teach us. Princes, lords with
other noble men should exerise them selfs in.iii. manner of works.
All princes, noble men and lords, should have three special works / which
they may do, specially in our country. The first that they anulle the horrible
abusage of eating and drynkyng / not only for the unmeasurableness of it /
but for love and charytie. For by sweet meats and sawces, without the which a
man may live well enough / no little loss of te^porall goods is crepte and
daily enters into this land. In taking away of the which two hurtes / the
temporal power should have enough to do / for they be deply roted. How should
the princes serve god better, tha^ to make their own regyo^s more plentuous?
The second is to take away ye unmeasurable wast of apparel and raiment, in
the which so much good is wasted / and that only for the pleasure of the
world and the flesh / yt it is fearful to think on it / that there should
be such mysuse found among the people, given and sworn to Christ / baptized
and dedycate to bear his cross with him / and daily preparynge our self to
death. If this were done unadvised, it might the better be sufferde. But now
when it is done so boldly, so vnponysshed, so unshamefastly / and so that no
man lets it, gain says it, nor resysteth it: yea rather glory and praise
is gotten by it / it is an ungodly, and an unholy thing, not becommynge
christen men. The third is to expelle and put away all pensyones and fayres
of vserye / by the which all men, countries, and cities, through out all the
world / be corrupt, wasted, destroyed, and lost / and that by ye ungracious
cloak and color which they make to the end that it should not be called
vserye / as to resygne a benefyce upon a pencyon, and than redeem it for money
/ and yet it is in deed worse than vserye, because it is not exchued, as vsery
is before. These ben the three Jews which (according to the common proverb)
suck up, waste, and consume all the whole world. In this point therefore ye
princes, noble men, and lords ought not to sleep nor be slothful, if they
will give a good account of their office before god.

HEre also might be showed the wickedness, famylyer, and greatly used of the
offycyalles and other the bysshoppes and spirytuall officers, which
excommunycate the poor people, and handell them and vex them with great
burdens and troubles / so long as they have one farthynge left. Such things
should be let by the seculer power / seeing yt there is no other remedy / nor
help. O I would to god yt there might be ones such a common wealth ordained /
which would take away all stews / as it was in the people of Israel / for it
is an unholy, and an vnchrystyan sign / that christen men should have an house
ordained for common sins / ye which thing in old time was not herd of.
Therefore it would be conuenyent, that there were a co^stytucyon and ordenaunce
made that men should be married betymes to maids, to avoid such myscheues /
in the which thing should labor both spyrytuall and temporal rulers / as well
the spyrytuall as the seculer offycyals / And if this was possible among the
Jews / why should it not be possible among chryste^ men. And again if it be
possible in some streets, castles, towns and cytyes / as we se before our iyes
/ why is it not possible i^ every place? But this lets it / that there is no
good governance in all ye world / no man will take pain And hereof it comes
that ye crafts men be feign to let their servants keep holy day / which
be so ryotous yt no man may let them. But and if there were an constytucyon and
an ordinance / that they should be compelled to observe and obey / and yt they
should not be received of any man in any other place / there should be a great
hole stopped to this myschefe / Oh god help / I trow, this be to great a
desire / And little hope I have that it will be reformed all that. Now se yt
here be but few works / declared to princes / lords, and officers / but yet
they be so good / and so many / yt they may have enough to do / wherein they
may serve god every hour / Now must these workys also / no less than all
other works be done in faith Let no man presume to plese god by his works /
but as by trust toward god / that he does such works to his merciful and
gentle god / only for the honor and glory of god so must he do them and so
serve and profyt his neighbor in them.

THe fourth work of this commandment / is obedyence of servants and
crafts men toward their lords and ladies, masters and maystres. Of whom /
speaks saint Paul to Tytus the second chapyter / let the servants be
obedyente to their masters, pleasynge them in all things not speaking agynste
them / but showing good faith in all things / yt they may garnysshe the
doctrine of our savior in all things / that he, which is against you may be
afraid, having no evil to speak of you Saint peter said also / servants
obey your masters with all fear / not only if they be good and curtoys, but
also if they be froward / for it comes of grace / if a man for consyence
toward god, endure grefe / suffrynge it unjustly / yea and now ye greattest
co^playnt in ye world is against servants and work me^ / that they be so
stubbourne / so unthrifty / so evil manered / and so desyrouse of advantage /
And this trouble is sent of god / For this obedyence / is the only work of
servants / wherewith they may be blessed / so that they neade not pylgrymages
to saints / another yet this dead nor that / if their heart only bow unto
obedyence that they be ready to do and leave undone what soever they know shall
please their masters and their wives / and that al in plain faith Not yt they
would deserve great things by their works / but that they do them all in
trust of the love and grace of god / in the which stand al deservings / and
that they come purelye and frelye of such love / desire, and trust in god /
so that they suffer such works to be an exercysyng and monysshynge to
stablysshe such a faith more and more / For as I have said often times / this
faith makes all works good / ye all works must be done of faith / so yt
faith is the master of works.

The master and maystres duty toward their servants.
OF the other part the masters and maystres, must rule their servants and
maids, and work men not cruelly / not seeking all things to the quycke / but
fuffer some things / as though they se now them not for peace and unity /
for seeing in this erthelye life / we live in vnperfytnes / all things can not
be done to the point in no degree or state / of the which says saint Paul to
ye Collosyans, ye 4. chapyter / ye masters do unto your servants yt / which
is just and equal / remembryng also that you have a master in heaven / And
therefore as the masters would not that god should do extremely with them / but
to be forgyue^ many things by his grace / so they ought therefore to be more
meke to their servants / forgyuynge them many things / yet they must take heed / that they live well / and that they learn to serve god. Here thou seyst
again / what good works / the good man and good wife of the house may do /
how goodly / how nyghe, how often, and how many ways / does he move and set
forth good works to us all? that we neade not to ask for good works / that
be far from us and inverted by man / as by going pilgrimage / building
churches / seeking of perdones / and such other / Here also I should speak /
how the wife ought to obey / be under give place, give few words / and suffer
her husband / as her superyour and master / where as it is not against god /
And again how the husband should / love and cherysshe his wife / not
requyrynge every thing to the vttermoste / as saint Peter and Paul have
spoken many things of this matter / but this thing is meter for a longer
declaracyon than the.x. commandments / and it may be lyghtlye known by
these chap.

But what soever is spoken of these works / it is comprehended in these two
obedyence and busynes. For obedyence beco^myth the people or subjects /
busynes besemyth masters or superyours, that they care for their subjects to
rule them well / to handle the^ curteysly and gently / and to do all things
that may profyt and help the^ / for this is their way to heaven / these be
the best works that they can do in the world / by the which / they be more
acceptable to god / than if they other wise did pure miracles / So says
saint Paul to ye Romans the.12. chapyter / he that rules in busynes / As
though he should say / Let him not be moved what other men, or other orders
do / another let him look of this work, nor of that / whyther it shyneth goodly
or seem obscure / but let him take heed of his one condycyon / reme^bryng his
state, how he may profyt his subjects / and there let him abide / not
sufferyng him self to be plucked from them, no, not by ye persuasyon of
angels in heaven / nor by temptacyons of ye devil in hell, this is a redye
way bringing him to heaven. Oh that if any man would thus keape him felf and
his degree / and would do this one thing / how rich should he be shortly of
good works so pryuelye and so closelye that no man should perceive it but god?
but now all these left undone / one ro^neth in to ye Charterhowse an other
hither / and an other thither / as though good works and the commandments
of god / were cast down / and thruste in to corners / and yet it is written in
the first chapter of the proverbs / that ye wisdom of god showed forth her
commandments open in the streets, in the cheyfe of the people / and in the
gates of the city / whereby is sygnyfyed / that they be ever plenteous, and
abundaunt in all places, states, degres and times. But we be so blinded / that
we se them not / in any place and so seek other works / ye which thing
Christ has showed before / Mathewe the.2.4. if any man shall say unto you /
lo here is Christ or there is Chreste / believe him not if they say / lo he is
in wyldernes / go not out / lo he is in the inward houses / believe them not /
for there shall arise many false anointed and false prophets.

Again obedience is conuenye^t for the subjects / yt they use all their
labor and dylyge^ce doing and leuynge of that / that their superyours require
/ not suffryng them self to be put or plucked from thense / another regarding
what other do / Another let them think / that they do well / or do any good
works, whyther they pray or fast / or what name soever it has if they
exercise not them selfs in this obedyence / But if there be any thing
commanded by the seculer power (there as is often times) that is contrary or a
let to gods commandments / than there ends obedyence / there is the
duty anulled / for here must be said / that saint Petre said to the rulers
of ye Jews / We must obey more god than men. He said not, we must not obey
men / for that were false / but we must obey more god than men / so we must
another help nor obey the prince / that will keape war / having an i^iuste
cause openly known / For god has commanded that we should not slay our
neighbor / Nether do him wrong / or hurt him wrongfullye. Also if the
temporal power command us to bear false wytnes to lie, to rob, to decyue,
and such other / we should rayther despise goods honor / body and life /
than do it / so yt the commandment of god might be saved and hole.

The fyfth commandment of god.
THe four first commandments have their works in reason / that is, they
take, rule and govern man, and subdue him / that he rule not him self / yt he
think not him self good, that he judge no great thing of him self / but that
he knowledge him self demure and low / sufferynge to be ruled / whereby pride
is withstand and resysted. But these commandments, that follow, meddle with
the lusts and desires of men / to slay their lusts also.

And first of all this angrye lust and desire of punysshement / of the which
speaks this fyfth commandment, thou shall not slay This commandment has
one work / containing many / and putting away many vices / and it is called
gentylnes or pacyence / the which is two manner of ways. Whereof ye one
apperyth goodly and beautefull / but it has nothing inward. This gentylnes
or pacyence / we have to our friends, and to them which be profitable unto us,
in riches, fame dygnyte, labor and favor. This gentylnes also we have to them
that another dysplease nor hurt us in word nor dead, such ge^tylnes is also
in dombe beestes as Lions and serpens / in hetahen men, Jews, Turks, Knaves,
mansleers, and harlottes. For all these be peaceable and quiet / if thou follow
their will / or if thou dysplease them not / And yet many be deceived by such
tryfelynge gentylnes / clokynge their ire / and excuse them self after this
facyon / saying I would not be angry if I might be in rest for other / even so
the devil would be content / gentle and peace able / if all might come after
his mind / But to this intent do dyssensyon and dyspleasure invade the / that
they may show the to thy self / how full of ire and malice thou art / that
thou so warned / may labor for ge^tylnes and pacyence / and to cast out
wrath / The other gentylnes is good and comes from ye rote and ground of the
heart / and shows him lelfe to his adversaries and enemies not hurti^ge them
/ not judging them / not abhorrynge them / not cursynge them, not backebytynge
them, not speaking or thynkyng evil of them / ye though they had taken from us
/ goods, fame, body, friends / and to be short all that ever we had / but
rather in what soever we may / we do good to them for evil / spekyng the best
of them / thinking the best of them / and prayenge for them. Of the which
speaks Christ in the.6. chapitre of Mathewe. Do ye good to the^, that do
evil to you / pray for them that persecute and trouble you. And saint Paul
to ye Romans the.12. chapter / say well and curse not / yeldynge evil for
evil to no man.

NOw se how this excellent and high work is gone to naught among chryste^
me^, that now nothing reyneth but strife, chydyng, war, ire, hate, envy,
backbytyng, cursyng, abhorrynge, hurtes, vengeance, and all manner of ire and
dysdayne / both in word and dead in every place. And yet nevertheless we
proceed still / with many holy days / hearing masses / mumblyng of prayers /
building of churchs / and garnysshynge the same, albeit wihout any
commandment of god / and so vnmoderatly as though we were most holy of all
christen men that ever were / suffrynge under these glasses and dysfygured
works / the commandments of god to lose and decay. In so much that there
is not one that thinks or remembers how nygh he is unto gentylnes,
kyndnesse, pacyentnes, and unto the fulfyllynge of this commandment of god.
Notwithstanding yet that god said not, he that does these works, but he that
keeps his commandments / should enter in to the kingdom of heaven.

For as much then as there is no man living in this world / to whom god has
not given an vtterar of his own ire and malice, that is to wit, his enemy or
adversary hurtyng him in gods dygnytie, honor, and friends to prove whither
there be any ire left in him or no / whyther he can love his enemy / speak
well of him / do for him do good to him / thinking no evil against him / Now
let him come that will, and ask / what good works he shall do, that may be
plesaunt to god and helthfull to him felfe / and let him set his enemy
before his face / let him have him contynuallye in the image and iye of his
heart / for this cause / that he may overcome him self / using his heart to
think friendly of him, to favor him after the best manner / to care and pray
for him: and after when there is occasyon or time / not only to speak well of
him / but also to do him good let him prove this / that will and if he have
not enough to do all the days of his life / let him reprove me of a lie /
and let him say / this saying is false. But now when god will have this
thing done and admytteth nor requires no less payment / but this kyndnes to
our enemy what I beseech you does it profyt us to be busye in other great
works not commanded / and to leave these commanded undone, therefore says
Christ, Matthew the fyfte chapter. I say unto you / he that is angrye with his
brother, is gylty of judgment / he that says to his brother Racha, that is /
which gives an abhomynable angry, and cruel sign of wrath, is gylty of
counsel. He that says fool / that is / he yt gives any manner of cheke,
backebyteth, slaundreth or curses, is gyltye of everlasting fire / where
abides than the vyolent layenge of hands? as to stryke, to cut, to wound, to
kill and to hurt, if the thoughts and words of ire be so grievously dampened.

But where as is the inward ge^tylnes, kyndnes, and pacyence of the heart /
there the heart has petye of all yt troubles that happen to his enemy / and
such be the true children and heirs of god and brethren of Christ, which did
the same for us upon the cross. Even likewise, as we se in a good judge which
is right sorry and loathe to give sentence upon the gyltye person / and is heuye
of the death put to him by the law. Here in the judge is a show in the work,
as though there were ire, dysdayne, and impacye^tnesse / but in wardly there is
very sorrow and pacyence abiding under such joyful works / and it than
swarmeth most quyckely and louyngly in ye heart, when it is constrained so to
be angrye and to exercise seueryte But here we must beware, that we be not
gentle and peace against the glory and co^maunementes of god. For it is
written, that Moses was gentylest of all men / and yet wha^ the Jews had
provoked and moved god, by the worshyppyng of a golden calfe he killed many of
them / and by that gate again the favor of god. So the officers and
superyours ought not to keep the holy day, and suffer sin to reygne / and
they in the mean time to say nothing unto it. I ought to despyce my honor /
my rythes, my loss, my hurt, nor to be angrye if any aduersytie happen unto
me / but we must regard the commundementes of god, and also defend and put
away the hurt and wrong of our neighbor. And the officers and rulers must
punysshe other / that is to say, private persons with words and rebukes. And
yet al these ought to be done with compassyon upon them that have deserved
punysshement / For this high goodlye and pleasant work, suffers her self
to be obtaygned easily if we do it in faith, and exercise faith in it / not
doubtyng in the favor and grace of god / it shall be a light thing for him
to be merciful and kind to his neighbor / how much soever he has
offended him / for we have offended god more greuouslye and cruelly.

Lo how short a commandment this is. But there is a long and great
exercise of good works and faith set forth in it.

The six commandment thou shalt be no Lecher.
ALso in this commandment is a work commanded contaynynge many good works,
and putting away many vices / and it is called clennesse or chastytie / of
the which many things be written, showed and known well to many. But it is
not so well observed and kept as be other works not commanded. So ready we be
al to do that that is not commanded / and to leave that, ehat is commanded.
We se that the world is full of fythye works of uncleanness, unshame fast
words, bawdy tales and songs. And besides these, the prouokyng is daily
increasyd with to much meat and drink / ydelnesse, and gorgeous apparel. And
yet we go forth still, as though we were christen men, because we go to the
church / whype up our prayers, fast and keape holy days, whereby we think all
perfyte. But and if there were no more works commanded but chastytie / we had
all busynes enough to do. For this byce is so peryllous and outragyous, yt it
rages in all our members / in the heart by thoughts, in the iyes by sight, in
the ears by hearing, in the mouth by words, in the hands, fete, and all the
body, by work it self. And to tame all these we must labor and punysshe
our self / so the commandments of god teache us. How much how truly, how
syncerely such good works ben exercysed god knows. Yea it is impossible for
us to think any good thing of our own power / I will not say to begin or
fynisshe it. For saint Augustyne says / that among all christen men's
battelles / the batell of chastytie is ye greattest, because it is daily
without ceasynge or leaving of / and because that chastytie seldom
overcomes. All saints have complained upon this / and all holy men have
bewailed it / as saint Paul to the Romans the.7. chap. For I know that there
dwells not in me, that is in my flesh any goodness.

THat the work of chastytie may have the higher hand, Say not another time
that the new learning (as the papystes call it) forbydeth tastyng watchynge,
labor, with other chastesynge of the body.
it dryueth us to many other good works / as to fastings and temperaunce /
against glotony and dronkennes, to watchynge and erlye rysynge / against sloth
and unmeasurable sleep, to labor and werynesse against ydelnes. For always
to eat, drink, sleep, sytte still, and be ydelyd / ben the armoure, defense,
and norysshynge of uncleanness / by the which chastytie is overcome by and by.
And upon the other side the holy apostle Paul calls fasting, watchynge,
labor / the armure of god, by the which uncleanness is tamed and brought in
order. But yet so as is said before / that such exercysynges go no further,
than to oppress uncleanness / and not to destroy nature. Besides all these,
the most strong wepen is prayer and the word of god / that when ye evil
lust and desire prycketh a man / than let him fle to prayer / calling upon
the grace and help of god. Let his mind be occupied upon it, lokyng in the
passion of Christ. So says he, in the.137. psalm. O city of Babell, worthy
to be dystroyed / blessid be he that shall take thine young babes / and throw
them against the stones / that is to say, when the heart is infecte / with
evil thoughts / being yet tender / and in the beginning, ronneth to our lord
christ, which is ye stone, by the which they be bruised, broken, and
dystroyed. Lo here every man laden in him self, shall find good business
enough to do good works in him self. But now it is so yt no man uses
prayer, fasting, watching, and labor, for this purpose, but for a clean
contrary intent, Albeit they were ordained and made only to fulfill ye work of
this co^mau^ement, and to purge it every day more and more. Besides this, there
have been some men which have showed how uncleanness might be avoided, as by
leaving of soft beds / pleasant chambres, gorgeous raiment / as well in
men, as in women / to famylyer co^munycacyon and countenance / and what soever
other thing is profitable to keep chastytie / in all the which things no man
can put a certain rule or measure. But every man must mark him self / what
things, how many, and how long they be profitable for him to keep chastytie,
and must chose them him self. But and if he know not by him self, let him
submytte him self a while to the instruccyon and learning of another / the
which may bring him up and instruct him in it, until he be able to rule
him self. For truly the abbeys and monasteryes were ones founded for this
cause. That children and young men might be taught goodness and chastytie in
them.

A Good and strong faith profyteth more sensablye in this work, than it should
in any other. In so much, The gyrdell of the reins
that Esaye calls faith the gyrdell of the reins / that is to say, the
keeping of chastytie. For spirytual chastytie pleases him that lives in it so
well that he promyseth and thinks him self sure of the grace and favor of
god. Therefore by this he may the more strongly resyste bodily uncleanness / for
ye spyrite of god shows him for certain, how he ought in such faith to
exchue evil thoughts and what soever is contrary unto chastytie. For as this
trust of ye grace of god lives workynge all works, without any intermyssyon,
even so it forsakes no wholesome admonyssion in things that be pleasant to
god, or dyspleasaunt. As saint John^ says in his epistle. I have not written
unto you, as though you were ignorant of the truth, but as to them that
know it. For ye have oyntement of ye holy ghost, and ye know all things /
that is ye spirit of god teaches you al things. Another must we despair,
though we be not delivered by and by from tempacyon. Yea we ought not to
determyne that we should have any rest of it so long as we live / another to
take it any other ways / but as a prouokyng and warning / to pray, to fast,
to watch, to labor, and other exercysynges, to tame the flesh / and
specially for to have and do such things to use our faith toward god. For yt
chastytie is not great that has quyete rest / but that which comes in
battle and fyghteth with uncleanness without ceasyng, expellyng all poisons /
that the flesh and the evil spirit cast unto us / so says saint Peter.
Derely beloved I beseech you as unacquainted and strangers, to abstain your
self from flesshely desires / which strive against the soul. And saint Paul
to the Romans the.6. chapyt. Let not sin reygne in your mortal body ye ye
obey his lusts. In this sentence and such other, is showed ye no man is fre
from evil lusts / but that we be compelled daily to fight with them. And all
though this conflycte bring pain and trouble unto our flesh / yet it is a
pleasant work to god, in the which ought only to be our pleasure and
comfort. For they that think that they shall withstand such te^ptacyon in
quietness / they kyndell and inflame it more and more / so ye al though it
rests a little while / yet it comes again more stronger / finding nature
more weak than it was before.

The.vii. commandment thou shalt do no theft.
ANd this commandment has a work co^taynyng many good works in him,
contrary to many vices / which is called lyberalytie / the which is such a
work, that a man is ready and mete to profit and socoure all men with his goods
/ stryuyng not only against theft and robbery / but also against all
dysceytes and gyles / which may be done in temporal goods of one man against a
another. As be couetyce, vserye, to great price, counterfete measure, and
cou^terfete wayght / for who can no^bre all new disceytes and subtle
inuencyons which be every day increased i^ all merchau^dyse, in the which all
men seek their own lucre and profit / with the dysprofyte of other,
forgettyng the saying of Christ Matthew the.7. chapter. What soever ye will
that men do unto you, do the same to them. If every man having this rule before
his iyes, would keep it in his occupacyon, in his merchaundyse and deeds. He
should find how he ought to bye and sell, to take, lend, and give frelye / to
promise and fulfill with such other. For if we behold the busynes and craft
of this world / and how great a swing couetyce has in them / we should not
alonlye have busynes enough (so yt we, would live with god and honor), but we
should also quake and be a ferde of this peryllous and wretched life / that is
troubled, ouerco^med and taken with care of temporal goods / and his
myscheuous gettings.

Wherefore it was not without a cause, that the wise man said / blessed is yt
man that is found without spotte / and has not gone after gold / another
has trust in the treasoure of money. Which is he, and we shall praise him /
for he has done miracles in his life / as though he would say / there is
none, or at the least very few, that know and perceive in them self such
gredynes, desire, and love of money. For here couetyce has a goodly cover of
shame and vice, which is called bodily sustenaunce and necessytie of nature /
under the which, couetyce labors so immoderatly and vnsacyably that a man
must beware to keep him self clean / that as ye wise man says / he may work
miracles in his life. Now se that this lyberall man shall not only do good
works / but also miracles which may please god and be praised. What need
has he than to ymagen or look for any other? Let him take heed of him self /
and let him beware that he go not after gold / nor yt put he trust in the
treasure of money / but suffer the money to fololowe him / and that money abide
for his sake, and not he for the money sake / that he love not the money,
another that his heart be set in it. Thus is he very lyberall a worker of
miracles and a blessed man. And as Iobe said in ye.31. chap. I never thought
gold my strength, neither have I trusted i^ it. And the.6.2. Wha^ your riches
increase, put not your hertes to the^. And Christ the.6. of Mathewe. Be ye not
careful, saying that what shall we eat? or what shall we wear? for ye gentyls
ask all these things. And ye father i^ heaven knows yt you need al these /
But here perauenture some well say / well trust thou not to that, and care
not, and look wha^ the roasted hen shall fly into thy mouth. Care is
forbidden and not labor.
Truly I say not that no man should labor / but that we should not be full
of care, and desire couetouslye, and that we should not mystruste, but yt we
should have enough / for we be all judged to labor in Adam / for god said.
Genesis the.iii. chapter. Thou shalt eat thy bread in ye sweet of thy face
/ and Iobe the.v. A man is borne to labor and a bird to fly / but even as
the bird flies not with care, busynes and couetyce / so we ought to labor
without care and couetyse / but and if thou care for birds and would the
roasted chekyn should fly into thy mouth / care and be busye lokynge whether
thou may fulfill the commandments of god or no, yt thou may be made
blessed.

Care comes of infydelytie.
True faith teaches this work by her self / for the heart that thinks
surely that it has god merciful and loving unto him: how is it possible yt
he should be careful and couetyce? for it must needs be yt god takes him and
defends him. And therefore he stycketh in no money / but he uses it with a merry
lyberalytie, to the profit of his neighbor / knowing yt he shall have
enough, how much soever he dystrybuteth or gives for his god, in whom he
trusts will not dysceyue him, another forsake him. As it is in the.36. psalm.
Verily I have been yo^ge and old / and yet saw I never the ryghtwyse forsaken,
or his sede beggyng their bread. Why the Apostell calls couetyse ydolatrye.
Therefore ye apostell called none other sin ydolatrye, than couetyce / which
utters it self grossly / how it trusts nothing in god / trusting to have
more good by his money than by god / by the which trust as is said before /
god is other truly honored, or else sclau^dred. And verily in this
commandment it may be clearly perceived, how all good works must come out
and be done in faith / for here every man perperceyueth by a meruaylous
surenesse / that as faith is ye cause of lyteralytie / so unfaithfulness is the
cause of couetyce / for he yt trusts in god is lyberal, doubting nothing but
that he shall ever have enough. And contrary he that trusts not in god, is
ever covetous and careful. Like therefore as in this commandment faith is
master and mouer of this lyberalytie / so is he chief workman in all ye other
commandments. In so much yt without such faith, lyberalytie profytes
nothing / but is rather a rasshe wastyng and expense of money.

HEre also is worthy to be known yt this lyberalytie and goodness must be
stretched and set forth even unto our enemies and adversaries. For what
lyberalyte is this, if we be only lyberal to our fryndes? as says Christ.
Luke ye.vi. chap. For an evil man uses such lyberalytie to his fryndes / and
the dombe beestes do good and be lyberal to bestes of their own kind.
Therefore a Christen man must think an higher thing, yt his goodness and
lyberalytie may help them yt deserve it not / his enemies and the^ yt have
hurt him after ye example of his heavenly father which suffers the son to
shine upon good and evil / and the rain to rain upon ye kind and unkind.
Here also thou shall find how hard it is to do ye works commanded by god,
and how nature wryeth and wrastelyth her with her self although she do easily
and gladly her own chosen works. So set before ye thy enemies and the^ yt be
unkind to ye, doing them good / and so shall thou find how nyghe or how
far thou art from this commandment / and how much busynes thou shall
have all thy life time even in the work of this one commandment. For except
thou help thy enemy, which has need upon the, and socoure him in his
necessytie / it is even as thou had stolen from him, for thou art bound
to help him. So says saint Ambrose. Feed the hungrye (says he) for if thou
feed him not thou kyllest him / as much as is in the. In this commandment
therefore depend the works of mercy, which christ will require of the in the
extreme day. Yet nevertheless the rulers of cytyes should take heed that
vacaboundes and freres Iacobyns and such other / strange beggars were put
away, and inhibyte, or at the lest they should be admytted by some mean,
measure and order, lest by such inordynate lyuers under ye name of beggyng,
errors and deceytes (of the which there be now many) should be suffered. I
have spoken more largely of the works of this commandment in ye sermonde
that I made of usury.

The.viii commandment / thou shall bear no false wytnes against thy
neighbor.
TRewely this commandment seems but little / but i^ very deed it is so great
/ that he yt will keep it must be in ieoperdye of his body and his life, of
his goods and fame of his fryndes and all that he has. And yet it
comprehends no more, but the work of a little membre, the tongue / that is to
say. The truth and gaynesay lyenge / if need require / and so here be forbyde
many evil works of the tongue. First such as be committed by speaking, than
after such as be done by holdyng our peace. By speaking when he that has an
evil cause in ye law / laboreth to prove and defend it by an evil
foundacyon, to take his neighbor in a tryppe, to lay out all yt he can for to
set out and promote his own cause / and hydynge and making less what soever
should help his neighbors cause / in the which thing he does not to his
neighbor, as he would be done to. There be some yt do this for profit and
some partly to avoid loss or sclau^dre / and both they seek more their own
profit tha^ ye commandments of god / and they excuse the^ selfs on this
facyon. The law helps him yt labors, as though they were not as well
bound to labor in their neighbors cause, as in their own. So they
wyllyngly suffer their neighbors cause go to naught, all though they know yt
it be right / ye which evil is now a days so common, yt I fear there is no
judgment nor act / but one pertie synneth against this commandment. Yea and
be it so that they be not able to bring their purpose about / yet they have an
evil mind and will to do ill, because yt they would have ye good cause of
their neighbor decay and their own evil cause prevail. And this sin is
chefely committed of the judges / Judges.
when the one part is a great man or enemy to the judges. For so they will be
avenged of their enemy, and not have ye dyspleasure of any great man. By this
means are begone flateryng and adulacyon / and at ye lest suppressynge of the
truth / for here no man will suffer dysdayne, hurt and ieoperdye for the
truth sake / and so the commandment of god must needs be trodden under fete.
And this is now for ye most part the rule and order of the world. He that
coueteth or wylleth to contynewe in this commandment may have both his hands
full of works, and be but only occupied with his tongue. Moreover oh good Jesus
/ how many be there, that by gifts and rewards be driven from the truth to
hold their peace? so that surely in every place, it is a high great and
rathe work, a man not to be a false wytnes against his neighbor.

Besides these there is yett a greatter wytnessyng of the truth, whereby we be
compelled to strive against evil spirytes / Evil spirytes be false teachers
and prechers.
but this strife begins not about temporal things / but for the gospel /
and the truth of the faith which the devil can not suffer, but so goes about
all things / that the chief of ye people (whom it is hard to withstand) may
resyste and persecute the true faith / of the which it is said the.81.
psalm. Take away the poor man, and deliver the nedy from the hands of a
sinner. And that this persecucyon is so seldom done and waxen out of use /
our prelates of the spirytualtie be in the fault / which suffer not the
gospel to be preched / but to be oppressyd / and so they have banysshed (as
much as in them is) the cause for ye which such persecucyon and witness
should be moved. And for the gospel they teach us their own tradycyons and
constytucyons, and what soever please them / and therefore Satan rests. For
when the gospel is banysshed / faith in Christ must also be banysshed, and so
all things come to pass after ye deuyls desire / but and if the gospel should
be raised up again, and hard of the people / undoubted all the world should
be troubled, sturrynge the greatter part of kings, princes, bysshoppes,
doctors and spirytuall men to strive against it as it has been always / so often
as the word of god came forth to light. For ye world can not suffer yt thing
that comes from god / the which thing was proved by our savior Christ,
which was the greattest and best beloved and chief thing yt god had / and
yet he was more cruellye persecute, than al other things that came from god /
so far was it of, that the world would receive or take him. And so as in his
time there be few yt so favor the truth of god / that will put body and life,
riches and fame / and all that they have in ieoperdye for it. And that is the
thing that Christ has promised to them that follow him. Saying Mathewe the.x.
chapter. You shall be hated of all people for my name. Also than many shall be
sclau^dred. But and if housba^demen, shepardes, horsekepers, and such fylthy
men should persecute this truth / who than might not or would not grant and
witness the truth? but now when the pope and bysshoppes, with princes and
kings persecute it / every man flies away, al men hold their peace, all
flatter, lest they should lose their goods, their honor, their favor / and
at the last their life.

ANd why do they this? truly because they have no faith in god / nor think
that they have any good of god / for where soever is this faith and trust
toward god, there is a strange heart bold, and without fear / which
grants and stands by ye truth, whether he lose body or goods / whether
it be against the bysshoppes or kings / as we se that the holy martyrs have
done, for such an heart is content with the mercy and gentylnesse of god / and
dyspyseth honor, favor, thanks, and riches of all worldly things sufferyng
all thing to go and come, that will not last and tarry. As it is read in
the.14. psalm. He abhors such sclaunderous and noughty persons / and such
as worship ye lord, he sets much by. That is tyrants and men of great
power, which persecute the truth and dyspyce god, those he fears not,
regards them not, he dispyseth them. And upon the other part / they that
suffer persecucyon for the truth / and fear god, more tha^ men. Those he
follows, those he stands by / those he defends, those he honors / who
soever be dyspleasyd with them. As we read in the 11. chapter to the Hebrews.
That Moses defended his brethren ye children of Israel / nothing fearyng ye
mighty king of Egypt. Lo again in this commandment / thou see shortelye
how that faith is the master of this work, for without faith no man dare
work it / so be all works grounded upon faith / as we have often times said
before. And so without faith all works be dead, though they appear, seem
and shine never so goodlye / and be called never so good. For as no man does
the work of this commandment / but he ye is strong, sure, and steadfast in
ye faith of the favor of god / so can not he do any work of ye
commandments without this faith. So yt of this commandment every man may
take a feeling and perseueraunce, whether he be a christen man or no / and may
know whether he does good works or no. Now we se yt almighty god has not
only set before us, our lord Jesus Christ / in whom we should believe with such
trust / but also yt we should have him for an example of such trust, setting
before us such good works in him / yt we should believe in him, follow him, and
abide evermore in him. As he says in ye.17. cha. of John^. I am the way,
Christ is ye way, truth, and life.
ye truth and the life / he is ye way, by ye which we should follow him / the
truth yt we may believe in him, ye life yt we may evermore live in him, upon
these things before rehersyd / it is manifest yt all other works not
commanded, be very perylous and easy to be known / as by building of
churches, deckyng of the^, pylgrimage to saints / and what soever is written
in the popes decrees, which disceyueth ye world, greueth and dystroyeth it /
and makes man's conscience vnquyete, and has brought faith to silence and made
it weak / therefore in asmoche as a man has busynes enough to do in ye
commandment of god, all other set a part / so yt he can never do al ye good
works commanded to him of god / why tha^ does he seek other which be another
necessary to him another commanded these works necessary and commanded left
undone.

THe two last commandments forbyddynge evil desires or lusts of the body /
and pleasures and love of temporal things be clear in them self, and without
hurt to our neighbor. And these lusts last to the grave / for the strife
against them contynueth us unto death. Therefore saint Paul writing to ye
Romans the.7. chapter comprehends these two commandments in one / and
they be set for one purpose, which we can not obtain / but only we labor
and strive to come to it unto the honor of death. For there was never man so
holy, which has not felt evil lusts in him / specially if he had any cause
or occasyon / for orygynall sin is naturally borne with us, sufferyng it self
to be oppressyd / but not to be utterly plucked away but by death / which death
for the endyng of this orygynall sin, is both profitable and to be wysshed
for / and that we may manfully fight against this orygynall sin. I beseech
god to help us. Amen.
