the Latin tongue is called Symbolum Apostolorum) and of the.x. commandments
of gods law / newly made and put forth by the famous clarke / Master.
Erasmus of Roterdame / at the request of the most honorable lord / Thomas

Cum priuilegio.

To the right excellent and most honorable lord Thomas Earl of wyl^ shyre: and
of Ormonde / (...) of Roterdame / Greatynge.
I Saw and perceued full well most honorable Earl / that of some persons I
should be accused of lewd boldness and presumptyon: if I would take upon me /
to make any co^mentary or work upon the Creed named the Symbol of the
Apostels / after so many / and so famous doctoures of the church among whom
Cipriane taking this matter in hand first of any Latin man has in such wise
handeled it: that no man / that ever has followed him yet until this day /
has been able to ouerg^te him / or to come any thing nere unto him. Again on
the other part / me thought I should be accused of improby^e and lewdenesse /
if I would not fulfylle and accomplish your request / namely desiring so holy
and so vertuose a thing with a good and godly affectyon / specially / seyn^^
that you have so well accepted and taken in good worth that my former service
rather than benefyghte done to you / in expou^dyng and declaryng the.xxii.
psalm. And I do know also well enough / that you do not require of me / to
take this little labor / for your own cause: which do not need any
instructyon or informacyo^ of me. But you do desire it for other more
ignoraunte and unlearned persons. And therefore I have so handeled the thing /
that I have shaped and ordered al mine oratyon and speech / after such form
and manner as might be most mete and agreynge to the capacyte of those that are
simple. Nether do I see or perceive o^y whitte at all / what laud or praise I
shall get by this my labor: except it be peradventure because that I have
spoken certain things somewhat after a plain / and homely perceyueable facyon
/ how be it as for praise / I pass not upon it. But would god / that the young
Soldyers of the Chrystyan cheualry / may take as much fruit and profyghte
hereof: as both your ^oste honorable lordeshyppe / of your excellent Charity
and goodness / does desire: and as I also / according to such little power as
god has lent me / have endeavored my self / and given dylygence / that they
should do. In the mean season / our lord is to be prayed unto / that he of
his bounte and goodness ^yll supply that / where my power does want and fail
/ and that he / which has inspyred into you this devout and godly affectyon
toward his relygyon and ^ayth / will vouchesaffe to send prosperous luck and
good end / not in this thing only / but also in all other things / which
of love and ^ele toward the honor of god / and furtheraunce of vert^^ and
good Christen living: you shall enterprise or begin: well moughte your
honorable lordeshyppe fare yeuen at Friburge / the year of our lord 1533

A Dialoge called the Symbol or instructyon in the christen faith or belyue /
made by Master Erasmus of Roterdame. The persons speakynge^are the Master /
and the Disciple / the one is marked by M the other by D.
The first instruction.
DISCIPLE. I Am and have Out of the church / which is the house of god / is
no hope of salvation.
out of the wiche church no man ought to hope the obtaynynge of everlasting
health and saluatyon. And therefore I beseech you / that of your charity you will
help mine infancye: that I may be spedde of this my desire and purpose. MA. If
of baptysme after due form and manner than art thou by the reason there of /
eue^ already admytted and received into the howseholde or company of the
catholyke I not need than to have an instructor and teacher? MAG. If there were
no need Mat. 16.
Go you and teach all natyons. But though thou had gotten syx hundredth
teachers / to instruct the / yet is it the lord / that does truly and
effectuosly teach this phylosophye and wysdom. For so it has pleased god and
has lyked him to give his benefits and gifts to one man: by another man. DI.
why has it lyked him to why it ha^^ plesed god to give his been fyght^ to one
man by another.ii. caus^^
which / that spyryte the lover of meke an^ myld minds: does hate and abhor
/ and secoundaryly / that through doing benefytes and good deeds / each to other
charity and love might be purchaced / encreaced / and nouryshed among christen
folk. And yet never the les neither may the doctor or teacher here challenge
any whitte praise to himself / if he does his office and duty neither the
dyscyple or learner to himself if he does profyght and go forward. All the
praise / every whitte of it: is due to god / which inwardly by his spyryte /
both does temper the organe / and instrumente of the ^eacher: and also does
transform and change the mind of the learner. Let us therefore both together
beseech the lord of his mercy / that by his inspiration / both thou mayeste
wisely ask and demand: and I also may frutefully and Hebr. 11.
He that comes to god (says he) must belyue. And in the.v. chapter to the
Romans. By whom: we have way and entrance through faith: into this grace.
Hebr. 11.
Again to the Hebrews: he says. Faith is the door / whereby we enter into the
house of god: that is the church.
without faith it is impossible to please god. The door or the gate of faith is
a very low door or gate / but after that one is entered ones with in it / it
shows to him the unspeakable maie^te of the power / of the wisdom / and of
the goodness of god. Stoop therefore and bow down thyn head / that thou
may be worthy to enter / and go in. DI. what is this / that you do say? The
^ii. pryncipal powers of man^es soul / understanding and will.
There are two pryncypall powers of man's soul: that is to wit: the
understanding / and the will. By the power of understanding: we do iugde what
is to be chosen / and by the will: we do desire that thing / which
understanding or reason (which are both one) has showed us for to be desired.
Both those.ii. parts has been corrupted through the crime and offense of them /
which were the first parents of all mankind / that is to wit / Adam and
Eve. Through the offense of Ada^ and Eve both man's understanding and also his
will are vicyated and corrupted.
The contagy on of this evil has issued from them / into all their posteryte
and ofsprynge. And by the reason here of it is brought to pass / that both
with our reason / as with a corrupt ^ye / we do wene and judge things to be /
which are not / or else not to be such manner things / as they are in very deed
/ and also that with our corrupted will (which thing chances oftentimes to
sick men) we do desire noisome and deadly things / in the stead of profitable
and wholesome things. Against these.ii. euylls / the goodness of god has
provided for us / two remedes / that is to wit / Faith / which puryfyeth and
cleanses the heart that is to say / the mind and reason / as being the
fou^tayne of the soul / and charity / which strayghteneth and amendeth our
crooked and corrupt will. Two remedies against the aforesaid evil faith
which purges the heart and charity which straighteneth the crooked will and
appetyte.
Faith as it were a lygh^ shynynge before us in the dark dryueth away all
error / in those things specially: Faith.
which do apertayne and belong to health and salvation. Charity.
Charity puts away crooked and lewd affectyons and desyrres / that we might
desire and follow only those things / which god has prescrybed or
commanded. Faith judges / and teaches what is to be don. Charity is the
servant of faith.
Charity executes the same in work / as being the mynyster and servant of
faith. Faith has one iye. Charity has.ii.
But the iye of faith is fyxed and set fast pryncypally upon god. charity
has as it were two iyes / with the right iye it looks steadfastly on god and
the left iye it boweth or tourneth a side toward thy neighbor / whils it
loves god / as being the most high and perfyghte goodness / above all things
/ and loves the neighbor / as being natural cosen: for gods sake. what
faith is.
Faith therefore / where of we do speak / is a gift infused and put into
man's mind / of god / through which man without any dowtefulnes does believe
all those things to be most true / which so ever god has taught and
promised to us / by the books of both testame^tes / the old and the new. This
faith stretches it self to three manner times / that is / to the time / that is
passed / to the time / that is present / and to the time that is to come that
is for to say / first it believes that the world was made by god / and what
so ever thing the holy divine scripture makes me^tyon to have been don in old
time passed. S^condarely: that the world: and the church is governed of the
same: god even this day also. And last of all / that all those things shall
come to pass and be fulfilled: what so ever the said scryptures does either
promise to good and vertuose men: or else does thretten to wicked and ungodly
persons. All these things / we do through the gift of faith / far more
certainly believe: than we do those things / which we do gather by
argume^tacyon and reasonynge or else of which we have sure perceiving and
konwleg by all our ow^warde senses. Faith is the most sure kowledge / that is
i^ this world.
DIS. But in as much as the books of holy scripture have come to us by men:
where of than comes that steadfast and sure persuasyon or beleffe. There is no
man so wicked: as to think or judge / that god may besuspected of fals^h^d and
untruth / but it may be dowted / whether all those books have b^n written by the
inspiratio^ of god. MAG. Ueryly this certaynte ryseth of many causes: The
causes moui^g us to ^eue fast and sure credence to the holy scryptures of god.
but pryncypally and chefly of one: first of all: it ryseth of natural
consent / for those things: which are taught in those books: are a great
part of them / agreble to the natural judgment of reason / a certain spark
whereof remains yet still even in men after the fall. Natural. Consent.
Secondaryly of the meruaylouse wondres or miracles / by which both the old
and also the new testamente has been given and taught. Miracles.
For neither have such wondres ben done ever at any other time / or in any
other thing: neither ever any man either durst / or could have feigned like
things unto them besides this of the meruaylouse and wondrefull consent and
agremente of all the things among them selffe and of each with other. DI. Of
which things? MAG. Of the fygures: and the prophecyes: The perfyghte
argument of the fygures and prophecyes of the old testament both among them
selves and also with the new testamente.
which proprely do appertain and belong to the old testamente. Add
hereunto the truth and euydence in the performynge and fulfyllynge of those
things which the old testame^te either had shadowed and signyfyed by
figures: or else had promised by the mouth of the profetes. In the examynatyon
of witness: thou know well / that the consent and agremente of the
records among the^ selves / is of great wayghte and greatly to be regarded.
Compare that Christ / which by many dark redles and fygures is sygnyfyed and
shadowed in the law of Moises / and whom so many Prophets did promise / and
that at diverse and sundry times / with him / whom the hystory of the Gospel
does set forth plainly before our iyes / as it were in a scafold: and thou
shall see all these things perfyghtly agree to gether. Over and besides this /
Prophets do meruaylously consent and agree among themselves one with another
/ where as among the phylosofers of the world / there is great strife and
contraryete of diverse and sundry that so many thousands of men / of children
/ of women / and of vyrgyns / nether with diverse and sundry kinds of death /
nether with torments / more fearful than death / could be plucked away from
it / whose minds the light of Faith had puryfyed? And this thing is by so
much the more meruaylouse and wonderful: The wonderful virtue and might of
the Christian philosophy.
for that this philosofye / as it were a certain son / did suddenly shine
and give light through out the whole world / and did overcome and get the
vyctory / nether by the help of might and power / nether of riches / nor of
any man's craft or polycye / nether finally by any worldly help or aid /
and also for that it has hitherto against the power of kings / against
worldly wisdom / against heretykes being a thousand manner ways instructed and
armed to impyete / and to be short against all the engynes of the Devil /
stand fast and sure / not able to be shaken / according to the promysse of
Christ. Math. xvi.
And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. DIC. I perceive now /
some light thou have touched it allredy of thine Faith is caused pryncypallye
by the ins^yration of the holy ghost.
which has now be gonne to show his effycacyte and stre^gthe in thy heart:
and as I hope and tr^ste: shall fynysche and make perfyghte tha^ which it has
begone. For this is the earnest penny or pledge of the dyuyne spyryte: which
by his secret inspyratyon does so confyrme strengthen: and estableshe man's
mind: that neither the power of the deuylls: neither aungells: neither any
creature at all: is able to depart it: and pluck it away from the the faith
and hope: which are in. Christ Jesus. Such an affectyon: can no persuasyon of
men gendre in our minds: which is a very sure and undoubted token: that all
these things are don and wrought from above / by god. For no manner thing does
set the mind of man at quietness and rest: save only this sure trust:
and we shall have it. DI. yt why the commu^e Creed i^ called the simbole of the
Apostles.
is called the Symbol or Creed of the apostles / and the old authors do
otherwyles call it the Rule of the faith or beleffe. This is a speech breflye
comprehendynge in few words / the sum of those things: which are
necessarely to be believed of all men unto eternal salvation. This Symbol or
Creed / in the old time / they that were baptized when they were grown in
age: did recyte openly / every man with his own mouth (and ware than called
Cathecumeni) before that they were dopped why the creed is called the rule of
faith
Math. xxiiii.
Heaven and earth shall pass away / but my word shall abide and not pass
away. DIS But what means this word Symbol? MA. The sygnificatio^s of this
greek word symbolum.
which signifies the same that confero does in the latyne tongue / that is /
to bring together. This word symbolu^: The first signifi^ation of this word
symbolu^.
the Greeks have used many manner ways / and in diverse significations. For
otherwhiles / they do call symbolum / the seal or mark: which is emprynted
on lettres / and vessels: to thente^t that they should not be opened of such as
were not mete and co^uenyent. Sometime again / they do call symbolu^ a gage
(whether it were money or a ryng / or any other thing) that they gave from the^
/ as many as were appoi^ted / and had made promise to have a common ba^kette
or feast together: The second signification
to the assurance / that every one of the^ should keep his appoynteme^t / and
no man withdraw: or absente him selffe. The.ii^.
Besides this also / they do call symbolu^ / the token / that is given between
the spouse and the spousesse / of their consent each of them to other: to the
end / that neither of them may shrynke from their promysse and bargayn. And
last of all / they call symbolum / that token or cognysaunce: The.iiii.
which was given to the soldyers / as many as fought under one and the same
standerde and bannere / which sometime was a watcheworde / sometime it was
without words / and therefore of them it is called Symbolon Aphonon / id est /
dumb toke^ / without any voice or sound. And this was don to the end / that
the soldyers which were all under one captain: should know each other / and
that if onye would attempt or goo aabout to work any gyle or dysceyte: by
this mark and token / they might have perceyuyng and knowledge of him. D.
These things have you spoken very plainly and clearly. But I desire and long
to here the conuenyence and agremente of the names (that is to say) why the
Creed is called by this name symbolu^ or how this name agrees to it. How all
the.iiii. significations of symbolu^: do agree unto the creed
MAG. Thou see / that in baptism / the forehede of him that is regenerat: is
merked or sealed with the figure of the cross. And saynct Paul calls the
Corinthianes which had professed the gospel: The sealyng of a vessel or of
an epystel.
his epistle / not wryte^ forsooth with ynke in parchemente: but in their hearts
/ with the spyryte / wiche spyryte is called the finger of god. ii. Cor. iii.
Luce. xi. ii. Cori. iiii.
The mind that is ones thus sealed and marked to god it is not lawful to
break up / or to open / to the devil. And the same Paul speaks in this
wise to the Corinthyans. We have this treasure in earthen vesseles. The mind
therefore of man / through baptysme: is made the vessel of the holy ghost which
vessel is sealed or marked with the sygnete of faith / ye moreover Christ
has sealed it with his one blood. And in the gospel. Luce. xiiii.
our lord compares the kingdom of heaven / that is to The gage be longyng to a
common feast or bankette.
wit / the grace of the gospel / unto a wit / the grace of the gospel /
unto a feast royal / unto which / all men of all nations are called. Now who
so ever has professed Christ in baptysme: he has given a gage / to come to
this noble feast / so that it is not lawful for him now to starte back. The
toke^ given between the spouse ^ the sposesse.
Besyed this / we do read oftentimes / that Christ is called by the name of a
spouse as the church likewise is called by the name of a spouse / as in the
mystycall cantycle / and in the third chapytour of Johan / ye more over / the
soul of e^he man in the professyon of the Faith: is wedded unto Christ her
spouse / saynct Paul declares this / writing to the Corinthyanes. I have
married you to one husband / that you should show your selves a chaste virgin /
to Christ. ii. Cori. xi.
Therefore a token is given of both parties / that it can not be lawful for
either other at any time to go about a dyuorcement Christ gives the earnest
or pledge of his spirit. Man beleuynge with his heart to his iustificatyon /
and confessinge or knowledgyng with his mouth / to his health and salvation:
does again of his part / give a toke^ or pledge / to Christ. Ephe. v.
Great is the mystery (as sayncte Paul says) of this marriage which is made
/ and knytte with a fast / and a sure vnlousable bond / between Christ and
the church. DI. I verily did wene ever until this time / that only vyrgins
professynge the religious life / had been wedded to Christ. MA. Forsooth they
are again married: raither than married / and in the order of spouses: they are
cheffe in preeminence / being so much the more nere to the spouse: by how
much they are more like unto him / but in baptism: the souls even of
mariners also / and of carters / and of shomakers / are made the spousesses of
Christ. It is all one spirit that is given to all them that believe in Chrest
of what estat or degree so ever they be. Poor and rych high and low / all
are one in Christ.
And it is all one and the same token / that is given to all men / as well to
the vileste beggar as to the might king or prince that is. And of this
thing doutles / ought those / that are abiectes and out castes / in the
sight of the world: to take a certain godly pride: for that in such things
which only does give the very true felicite / and which do make men truly
excelle^te / truly rich / truly mighty and truly noble: they are egall and
matches to kings and princes / be they never so rich and great of power. DI.
you show here the meruailouse and wonderful benignite and goodness of god.
MAG. Whom can that most meke and gentyl Lamb refuse or reiecte / which:
Luc. xxiii.
when the theffe hanging on the cross did profess: forthwith did bydde him
to the brydall feast / and of a sin full person and blaphemouse against
himself: made him part taker with him of his kingdom? DIS. Forsooth all
things agrees meruailously well hitherto. MAG. The watcheworde or the badge
of soldiers in war.
Finally and last of all / they which are new borne again by the holy bathe
of baptism: they do profess the Euangelycall cheualrie or war / and do
become servants and soldiers under the immortal captain Jesus Christ / and
are bounden with his mylytare sacraments / and do receive the gift or reward
of the spirit. So that it is a point of extreme vnfaithefullnes / and also
unkindness: to forsake this captain / and run from him to the tyraunte
the deuille. who do forsake Christ thi^ captain.
Now all they do forsake him / not only which do deny Christ / and do
run unto the turk or to the Jews:

But also which with their hole heart and mind are given to the world / and
worldly co^modytes and pleasures. For the ryghtuose man also falls even
se^uen times in a day. But he ryseth anon again by the quycknes and strength
of faith / which / like fyere does always labor upward unto heavenly
things. DIS. Would god that spyryte would vouchesaffe to write in my heart /
and to seal fast that / which he has written: with a sure and an inuyolable
Symbol or seal. M. Would god he would vouchesaffe to committee to thy heart and
mine that inestymable treasure: and that which he has put and laid up in our
hertes: to make sure and defend with his seal or mark. DIS. But we must than
offer and give to him clean parcheme^te and a clean vessel. MAG. ye and even
this thing also shall he himself grant unto us / how be it not without out
own help and workynge there unto. DIS. O how happy and blessed a feast is
that / which both in this world has the joy of a good and clerre
conscience: and from hence does send us unto the celestyall feast? MAG. ye
moreover how happy and how blessed a maryadge is that: which makes us one
with god / whom to cleue and stycke fast unto: is most high and syngulare
felycyte? D. But cheualry or war is a name of labor and travail. MA. No
man is crouned save only he which has fought lawfully. But the pains that
are to be taken in this world: are transytorye / and last but a short while.

The crown or reward is everlasting / and shall never corrupt or fade. ii.
Timo. ii. ii. Cori. iiii. i. Petri. v.
furthermore that labor or travail that is here / the spyryte does make
dulcete and sweet with so many solacyes and coumfortes: that all the resydue
may be suffered and endured not only pacyently / but also gladly and
cherefully. Job.vii.
This life is a battle: whether we will or not / we can not chose / but we
must war either on gods part or else on the deuylles. They that war on
the deuylles part / Joan. xii.
which is called the prince of this world / do suffer more hard and more
paynfull things / than do they / that war on gods part. And Christ's
soldyers do joy and rejoice no less / than they do / which do seche and hunte
after sweet and plesaunte things / both by land and water: The co^paryson of
the estate of Christian sold yers and the deuy les werryes.
but they joy after an other manner or facion. Nay rather they only are truly
glad and joyful / beside this the stypende or wages / which these.ii.
captains do pay to their soldyers: are excedyngly far unlike / and contrary
the one to the other: that is to wit to triu^phe eternally in heaven with
their captain Christ: and to be given to the everlasting fyere of hell
with the tyraunte the deuille. DIS. yt is a meruailouse thing than / that the
commune sort of men do led their life after such manner / as they do. MA. The
cause thereof is / because many men do pronounce the Symbol or Creed with
their mouth: and few do believe with their heart / or if they do believe: they
believe but coldely and fayntly. D. But I have a greatte while desired to here
the rudymentes and pryncyples of the heavenly philosophy. i. Corintio. i.
MAG. Rudimentes they are in deed / but that which is lowest thing here:
passes and surmou^teth / far all the hygheste points of worldly wisdom.
But because we do beter and sooner perceive those things / which we are gredy
and very desyrouse to learn: therefore they that do teach humanye disciplines
/ are wont to commend the said disciplines unto their disciples and hearers
by diverse means / but principally because of the authoure / of the matter: of
the form / and of the end. D. I do not well perceive that which you do
say. M. As for example / the science of physike has for the author^re of it:
The authore of Phisieke.
Hippocrates / and (if we believe poets) Appollo / it treats and is occupied
about things / which do help or hurt the health of the body. The matter
whereof it treats.
This is the matter or material cause of it / it sto^deth by knowledge of
natural things / and by experymentes. The form. The final cause or end of
it.

Theauthour of the stoike philosophy. The matter. The form. The end,


Think this to be the form / the end of it is the health of the body as
far forth as is granted to man for to have health in this world. D. Thou
make here no mention of lucre. M. That peradventure is the end or pryck
where unto certain physicio^s do labor / but yet the end of the art or
science: is the prosperouse health of the body / likewise the Stoyke phylosophie
has for the authoure of it: zeno / it treats: what is vire and what is
virtue / it gathers or concludes with Dialecticall reasons / it promises
tra^quillite and quietness of mind: but in this life only / and it also false
or diseytfull / for nothing does verily qete and set at rest the mind of man:
save only the grace of Christ / which they did never so much as ones dream
of. Nothing quseteth the mind of man: save only the grace of Christ.

The author The matter / The form / and the end of the chryste^ philosophy.


But of this philosophye / of which thou begynnest now to be a learner: the
authoure is god / the matt: is vertuose life / the form: is the inspyratyon
of the aeternall god / the end: is the heavenly life / nay rather to speak
better: all these things is god him self. And zeno verily in many things both
does dysceyue and is dysceyued. And because he is dysceyued in the end: it
could not be chosen / but that he must needs be dysceyued also in the means
to the end. But here where god is al in all: there can be none error / no
cloud / none ambyguyte or dowtfulnes. He is the beginning: he is the progress
or myddle course / and he is the end Seeing than / that we do find men / which
do desire and go about to learn humayne dyscyplynes / whithe exceeding great
labors / and great costs bestowed a long time: with how great feruoure of
mind is it mete to learn this philosophy / which came from god / and which
by pure and clean life / with merualouse speed brings unto that blessed
immortalyte? DIS. Math. xiii.
Forsooth you speak of a very precyose Margarite or perle / wiche ought (and
not unworthily) to be purchased and bought: though a man should make sale of

our lord which was conceived by the holy ghost: and borne of the virgin
Marie. And suffered under Ponce Pilat was crucyfied: deed: and buried. Went
down to hell and the third day rose again from death to life. Ascended to
heuens: and sits on the right hand of god the father almighty. From thence
shall he come / to judge both the quyck and the deed I believe on the holy
ghost. I believe the holy church Catholyke: the communion of saynctes. The
forgyuenes of sins: the rysynge again of the flesche: and the life
everlasting. Amen. D. I here of you a breffe word. M. And thou seeste a
mustarde sede. Now thou perciuest: I trow that there is but one god: which
name for all that co^prehendeth three persons: that is to wit: the father:
which only is of none other / the sone which was begotten of the father /
before al time. The holy ghost: which proceeds from them both. DIS. I
perceive. MA. Let not man's wit imagine here any transytorie or bodyly thing
/ all things here are eternal / unspeakable / and incomprehensyble / to the
understanding of which / man's reason is obscure and blind / and they are
perceyuede oneleye by faith. They are three distinct in propretes / but they
are al.iii. of one and the same substance or nature / or of one essence (which
some men do suppose to be the more apt and mete word) They are of one
almyghtines / of one majesty / of one wisdom / and of one goodness. There is an
order in the divine trinite but none inequalyte.
There is in deed an order in this trinite / but inequalyte there is utterly in
it none at all For none of them is posterioure to the other / in time. Neither
is one of them inferyoure to annother / in dignite. The diuysyo^ of the Creed.
The deite of them all three: is one / and they.iii. are one god. Hereof ryseth
the most general and most perfyghte distinction of the Symbol into partes^
The father and sone are knitte to gether by the holy ghost.
The father has the first place / the sone has the second / the holy ghost
has the third which is the charity or love / and a certain unspeakable
bond or knotte of the^ both. The father makes all things / the son
restores things fallen and decade / the holy ghost works to gether with
them both. D. I understood you very well. MA. But in the son because he
alone took unto him the nature of man his divine nature being in no point
mynyshed or changed / though he be one person / yet is there many substaunces
/ that is to wit / the divine substance / In Christ ^^ but one person and yet
three substaunces.
which he has all one and the same with the father and the holy ghost / the
soul of man / and the body of man / which likewise as he was borne very god
of god his father: so was he borne a very man / of a woman his mother. To him
does the church cleue: as the body of man does cleue to the heed. And likewise
as that divine spirit does join and knyt together the father and the son:
The church is the mystical body of Christ joined to him as to her head / by
the divine spirit.
even so does the same spirit glue the church unto Christ / with a secret
and fast bond / not able to be lowsed. The mystycall body therefore of Christ
/ occupies the.iiii. part of the symbol or creed. There are other diuisyons
of the Creed but this diuisyon shall show some light to him / that is a
begynner. Now therefore reher^e thou the symbol again of thy part. DIS. I
shall with a good will. Credo in Deum patrem omn^potentem conditorem celi e^
terre. The first part of the Creed.
I believe on god the father almighty maker of heaven and of earth MA. Here thou
haste the first portion. DIS. Et in Iesum Christum filium eius vnicum dominu^
nostru^. The second.
And on Jesus Christ his only sone / our lord. MA. Now art thou entered into
the.ii. part of the symbol which teaches the divine nature of Christ / whereof
I told the before. D. Qui conceptus est de spiritu scto^ / naius ex Maria
virgin: Which was conceived by the holy ghost / and borne of Marie the
virgin. MA. Here thou hear the very and perfyght nature of man in Christ /
and shall by and by here the redemption of mankind. DI. Passus sub Poncio
Pilato crucifixus mortuus and sepultus est. Did suffer under Ponce Pilate / was
crucified / dead / and buried. M. Thou hear here / beside so many undoubted
tokens declaryng him to be a very man: the meruaylouse battle and fygth of
Christ / with the tyrau^t the devil. D. Descendit ad inferna. He descended to
the hell. MA. Here thou hear / what that blessed soulle of Christ did: at
what time his deed body did rest in the sepulcher. DI. Tertia die resurrexit a
mortuis. The third day he rose from the deed. M. Thou hereste here the
victory of the heed / and the hope of the me^bres. D. Ascendit ad celos. He
ascended to the heue^s. M. Here thou hereste the triu^phe of the victoriouse
co^querour. D. Sedet ad dextera^ dei patris omnipote^tis. He sytteth at the
right hand of god the father almighty. M. Mat. xxv^^^
Here thou herest the everlasting and insuperable monarchy or kingdom of
Christ / to whom is given al power and auctorite / both in heaven and earth.
D. Indeventurus est iudicare viuos et mortuos. From thence shall he come again
/ to judge the quycke and the deed. MA. Here thou herest his second coming.
For at the former time / he came in the humylyte and ^ownes of the flesh to be
the savior of all me^. Christ's two co^ynges after two so^dry manners.
At the latter time / he shall come in the glory of the father / to judge both
good men / and wicked men / and to give to every man a reward according ^o his
deseruinges. Math. xvi. The. iii.
D. Credo in spiritu^ sctu^m. I believe on the holy ghost. M. Here thou have
the.iii. part of the symbol or creed. The. iiii.
DISC. Sanctam ecclesiam catholicam. I believe the holy church. etc. MAS. Here
thou haste the.iiii. part of the Symbol / which describes the mystical body
of Christ / that is the church. Now if thou take Christ whole there are but
three portio^s. And the holy church / very well and conveniently is annexed and
joined to the holy ghost. For by the gift and benefyghte of this ghost is
holy: what so ever creature is verily and truly holy / where fore of sayncte
Paul it is called the spirit of sanctifycation. Romans i.
This is that spirit of the spouse: which never departs or goes away from
the bosom of the spousesse. And because Ecclesia in the Grek / does betoken a
congregation: Ecclesia.
by this spyrite does cleave together: what so ever is well and happily joined
or knytte to gether. This is that unspeakable cyrcle / which joins or
coupleth to gether / the.iii. persons among them selves / and which with
them also g^ueth good angels and good men / all together in one. For the name
of the church may comprehend also the blessed spirits / all be it that god
came not to redeem the^ which continued stable in that good and blessed state
/ in which they were created. But mankind / because it was fallen from the
state / in which it was made / in the first parents Adam and Eve: it neded to
have a redemer. But now go forth on with the resydue of the Creed. DI.
Sanctorum co^munionem. The communion of sai^ctes three manner ways taken and
expounded
The communion of saynctes. MAG. This parcel / certain men do so understood
/ that it does by apposytion expound the next parcel going before / which
is sanctam ecclesiam catholicam The holy catholic church. For this word
Ecclesia (id est) Church: is a name of society and fellowship / and it is a
contynuall and a fast vnlowse able ioynynge to gether of all the members of
Christ / among themselves / each with other. How be it certain other men do
think rather / that the.vii. sacraments of the church are be tokened by
these words. And certain other again do think / by these words to be
sygnyfyed the common felowshyppe or part taking each with other of all good
works. D. Bemissionem peccatorum. I believe remission and forgyuenesse of
sins. MAG. Here thou do here / what is the policy and good order of this
city or co^munaltie / in this world / in which world as there is no
perfyghte felicyte even so is there in it neither perfyghte puryte and clennes
/ neither full saturyte and satisfyeng of man's mind. And therefore / it
happens often times that they which have grievously fallen in to sin: have
need of a remedy / and that they which are weak and feeble: have need of
strength and hartenynge. Now either of these.ii. things / does the grace of
god give sufficientlye / unto us both by other means: but pryncypally and
especyally by the Sacraments of the church. And therefore when thou hear
remission and forgiveness of sins: thou hear a double medicine or salve
the one by the holy and blessed bath of baptism / and the other / by the
sacrament of penance. Remission of sins thorw baptism and p^naunce.
DISC. Carnis resurrectionem. I believe the risynge again / of the body. MA.
Here is opened and showed unto the / the end of our war / and the
consummation and perfection of the church / and either the eternal felicite:
or else the eternal calamite and misery of the whole man / that is to wit /
both in body and soul. DI. Et vitam eternam. And everlasting life. MAG. Here
thou heareste the incomparable hi^re or wage / and reward / which our
captain has prepayred and ordained for his soldyers: if they warrynge
faythefully according to the ensaumple of their captain / under his standerde
or banner / shall have behaved them selves manfully / even until their death.
Thou have now all the pryncypalle and general parts of this wholesome tale or
Comedy / thou have also all the acts and stenes of that heavenly order and
setter forth of this co^medie set in order by a wondre fulle and unspeakable
dispensation. DIS. Are there any that make a more subtle division of the
Creed: than this? MA. ye there are certain men of later time: which instead
of.xii. artycles / do make xiii. Some there are again / which make.xiiii. not
according to the order of the the text. But following this consideration /
that all the artycles do belong either to the divine nature of all the
persons: or else to the humayn^ nature of Christ: or else to the mystical body
of Christ / to every one of these / they do apply certain artycles or
parcelles and so are there made.xiiii. articles. But this distinction or
division helps but smally / and is of little wayghte or value to the purpose:
that we have in hand. For after this manner might men ymagyne also other
divisions / according to the diversity of men's wits / and to the diverse
considerations that may be made of the same things.

But that is the princypall and heed point of all: that he says here the world
to have been myghtyly created of god / and of the same god / by his sone / to
have been wisely and mercyfully redeemed / the beginning and decourse of the
church the holy ghost gouernyng it by his secret inspiratyons and breathynges
/ the co^summation and perfection of the church when the son shall deliver
his kingdom hole / perfyghte and quiet to his father. DI. Certain men do
assygne and give to every one of the Apostles: one article of this Creed. MAG.
if they that so do say true / than are they disceyued: which had lever
make.xiiii. artycles. For what intent it was devised / that the Apostles made
each one of them one articule of the Creed.
But yet never the less this was profyghtably devised and fownde out: to
thentente doutlesse that such as were unlettered: might at ones with one
labor / as it were by images set in order: empryn^ and grave fast in thyr
remembrance / both the names of the Aposteles / and also every one of the
articles. For it should be very conueniente and according / that all the
parlers and closettes of Chri^ten men were decked and adourned with such manner
tables / as these. DIS. O good lord / how copyouse philosophy or wisdom is
comprehended in this so little / and so short a symbol? MAG. But i^ is very
probable and lykely / that among the^ in old time the creed was yet shorter /
than this. For it should seem / that they made an end of the creed with this
clause. Inde venturus est iudicare viuos et mortuos. From thence shall he come
to judge the quycke and the deed. This may we gather of the symbol of
Athanasius / which / though he does declare this symbol: yet does he touch
none of these things. Neither does the symbol / which is reherced in the
canones / for the symbol made in the counsel holden at Nice: go any further
than the aforesaid clause / save only / that it adds these words. Et in
spiritum sanctum. And in the holy ghost / which same symbol beside this /
diffreth in many words / both from this symbol / and also from that symbol
or creed / which is songen in the mass / which seems to have been made in
the synod holde^ at Constantinople. The same also is gathered of Tertullia^ /
as of his book made against Praxea. Again of the book de virginibus velandis /
in the beginning. Also in the book de prescriptionibus hereticorum. DIS. Is any
of those things than superfluose: which are added afterward? MAG. God
forbydde. But these things have been added and put to be cause of co^tentiouse
and gross persons / that the speech should be more express and euidente:
ra^ther than fuller and perfighter. For when thou hear these words. Qui
conceptus est de spiritu sancto. which was conceived by the holy ghost: thou
herest the profession and knowledgynge of the third person. Again when thou
herest passus est: that Christ has suffered: thou vnderstondest also forth with
the church / for which he did suffer. For our lord did another suffer for
aungelles / which neded it not / neither for the deuilles: which were fallne
never to be repaired or restored / again much less tha^ did he suffer for
beasts. Thou herest also the fountain of all remission / for neither baptism
/ neither the sacrame^^ of penance / has their efficacy and strength from
any where else: than from the precyouse death of Christ. Also wha^ thou herest
Tertia die resurrer^^ a mortuis asce^dit in celos. That he rose ^gayn from
death / and assended into heaven thou seeste the rysynge again of the bodies to
be showed / which we do all look for with sure and steadfast hope. For the
head raignynge in heaven / will not suffer his members to be vnperfyghte and
lackyng their one halffe. He rose again whole and perfyghte: and so shall we al
so rise again whole and perfighte. Last of all / when thou hear. Inde
ventrus est iudicare viuos et mortos.

From thence shall he come to judge the quycke and the dead: this word
iudicare to judge does signify and show the diverse rewards of good me^ /
and of wicked sinners / which after ward was said more planly by these
words. Et vita^ eternam. And the everlasting life. D. Why is this Creed
called the sym^ol of the apostles? why the commu^e Creed is called the simbole
of the Apostles.
M. That by this title it might be distinct and known from the other
Symboles / that is from the Symbol made in the council holden at Nice. From
the symbol made in the counsel holden at Constantinople / from the symbol of
Athanasius / and many other symboles / of many other me^nes making and it is
very probable and lykely / that this was the first symbol of all / that ever
was made. And likewise as in the old time among those barbarouse / simple and
truly knowing no fraud or gyle / even in the greateste bargayns of all /
either there were no manner oblygations or endentures at all / or else they were
very short wrytynges / and it was sufficient to make a note in a paper / I do
freely give or bequethe so many acres of land / to such or such a church:
even so as long as the puryte and synceryte of the faith was quycke and
strong in the minds of men: either there was no need at all of this writing
or oblygacyon / or else it was sufftciente for it to be comprehended in very few
words. The curiosite of philosophers: and the peruersite of heretics / gave
the occasion of making so many and so long Credes
The wicked curyosyte of philosophers / and the peruersite of heretics / was
the occasion of so many words and so many symboles to be brought in / and even
likewise as the craft and subtyle falsehed of men / has been the cause: that
in bargayns now a days there is need of so many and so long instruments and
wrytynges. But in none of all the churches did the fervent love of holiness and
virtue / and the synceryte of the faith longer continue in vigoure and
strength / neither have fewer heresies: nor more slowlye cropen in to any
congregation or church: than into the church of Rome: would god that the
pleasures of this world had no more ple^tuosly flowen unto it / ye moreover
even this selffe same Creed / which sayncte Cipriane has expounded and
declared is somewhat shorter: Credo in d^^ pre oi^pote^te.

Et in Jesus Christo filio eius vnico domino nostro qui natus es^ de spiritu
sancto / ex Maria virgin. Crucifixus sub Poncio Pito / et sepultus est. Tertia
die resurrexit.

Asce^dit in celos sedet ad dextra^ patris Inde venturus iudicare viuos et
mortuos.

Et in spiritu scto^ / scta^m ceelestia^ / remissionem peccatorum. Huius carnis
resurrectionem.


tha^ this is of owers as we do say it. DIS. I beseech you reherce it to me /
if it shall be no pain or greffe to you. MAG. Harken than.

I believe in god the father almighty. And in Jesus Christ his only son our
lord / which was borne by the holy ghost of the virgin Marie: was crucyfyed
under Po^ce Pilate: and buried. He rose again the third day: he ascended to
the heuens: and sytteth on the right hand of the father. From thence shall he
come to judge the quycke and the deed. And in the holy ghost. I believe the
holy church. The remyssyon of sins. And the rysynge again of this body. DIS.
I perceive here many things to be left out: and somewhat also to be added.
MAG. And sayncte Ciprian does not dissemble or hyde that / for forth with in
the first article / he does show that specially and chefly in the churches of
the east is added. I believe in god the father almysthty vnuysyble and
vnpassyble. Again he says that addytion he went down into hell: not to be
had in the Symbol or Creed used in the church of Rome / likewise again in
that percelle the risynge again of this flesh: he confessethe and knowledgethe
the pronowne this to be added in the church of Carthago. There do^ want
somthynges / nay raither they do not want: but are vnderstonden of other
things / which are expressed and set out already. Saint Cipriane semethe not
to add this sentence.

The creature and maker of heaven and of earth. But he gathers this of the
Greek word Pantocrator. Pa^tocrator.


For this word does not somuche sygnyfie one that is almighty: as it does
sygnyfie one that holds all things / and that rulethe all things / which
word does not express and show / that the world was created and made by
god: but it does tell us and put us in knowledge and remembrance / that it
is governed of god. Now would he not govern the world / that had been created
and made of another.

And for as much as even the very gentyles or paynymes / by the informacyon
and teaching of poets / do believe / that the world was created by god / and
seeing that also the book of Genesis does inculcate and reherce the same
thing by so many words: they judged this partycle to be more euydente than
that it neded to be expressed.

These words also were left out / qui conceptus est: because in the Gospel
it is said. Natum est for conceptum est / for thus speaks the angel to
Joseph / quod enim in eanatum est de spiritu sancto est^id est: Math. ^.


For that which is conceived in her: is of the holy ghost. Therefore this
word natum est / which is common both to the child that is conceived / and
to the child that is brought forth into this world: seemed to the old fathers
a more propre and a more mete and conuenyente word / to signify and betoken /
that thing to have been do^ by the workynge of the divine spirit / in as much
as neither in the conceyuynge was there any concupyscence of man: neither in
the deliuerau^ce or birth was there any violation of the virginal dignyte or
integryte and clennes / Besides this / this word conceptus sounds or
sygnyfyeth a certain thing without facyon and vnperfyghte. For by little and
little does the sede crudde or grow to gether in the matryce of the woman: and
afterward takes lyffe and soul: These things to say of the conception of
our lord: we are afraid.

Again in the article following / he does not say he suffered under Ponce Pilate
so as we do say: but he said was crucified: that he might not only express
the death of him: but also the ma^er and kind of his death: neither does he
add was deed: but only says was buried. For to that entente are men hanged
on the crosse^ that they should there dye: neither are men buried: except they
be undoubtedly deed. And also when he adds and rose again: that is to say: he
revived again: in so saying he does openly and plainly enough profess / that
he was deed. And saynct Augustine does not dysagree or varye in this point from
Ciprian / which repeteth it in this wise. Therefore we do believe upon him:
which was crucyfyed: and buried under Ponce Pilate. Neither did Cipriane say.
He rose again from deed men: but only / he rose again the third day. For no
man reuiueth again: but from death. And when he says. That he sytteth on the
right hand of the father: he adds not of god / neither almighty which two
words do seem to have been added and put to / out of the symbol of Athanasiu^.
For what did it need to express these words here in this place / seeing that
it has before called the father of Jesus: god almighty? Neither does he read
thus. Credo in spiritu^ sanctum. I believe on the holy ghost: lest he might
seem to begy^ne a new symbol or creed / but having respect / and reformynge
his speech unto those things that went before / he had lever understand the
verb Credo: which was also vnderstonded when he spoke of the son. I believe
in god the father / and in his only son / and in the holy ghost. For it is
all one faith: by which we do believe the.iii. persons of one essence. And
anon after in the next article / he says not in sancta^ ecclesiam: but
leueth out the prepositio^ in showing the cause with many words / why that
preposition is not to be added. Neither does he add this word catholica^ /
no more dot^ saint Austine neither add it in the symbol: but he adds it in
his interpretation / saying vtique catholicam that is to wit catholic. And
what neded it to add this word catholic: seeing that there is no church
holy / but only the catholic church / which church this Epitheton or
adjective s^ta^m holy disseuereth from all the church of heretics of the
Jews: and of the paynyms / and when he says. And in the holy ghost / and by
and by after does put these words / the holy church: leuyng out also the
preposition in: it is euidente that Ciprian did not read in scta^m ecclesia^.
And to make an end: that last clause / and everlasting life is also left
out. But this was sufficiently vnderstonded of the word resurrection or risyng
again that went next before / in which is comprehended the sundry and diverse
rewards of good men and wicked men. And also of that clause gone before: to
judge the quycke and the dead / as we have said before. And that Cipriane did
read the Symbol none other wise than I have recyted / it is eu^dente and easy
to perceive / not only by his interpretation and declaration made upon the
same: but also by the Epiloge or recapytulatyon which he puts to afterward
in the end. For there showing that only to the father son / and holy
ghost is added this preposition in / and not in any wise to the other
articles: he recites in this wise.

Sequitur nanque post hunc sermonem. Sanctam ecclesiam. Remissione^ peccatorum.
Huius carnis resurrectionem. Non dixit in sanctam ecclesiam. Nec in remissionem
peccatorum. Nec in carnis resurrectionem. Which ^s thus much to say in
English. For it follows after these words. The holy church. The remyssyon
of sins. The rysynge again of this flesh.

It seyde not in the holy church. Nor in the remyssyon of sins. Nor in the
rysynge again of the flesh. Moreover being about ward to expound and
declare this article. The rysynge again of the flesh: he makes this preface.
Sed vltimus iste sermo qui resurrectionem pronunciat / summam totius
perfectionis succincta breuitate concludit (which is thus much to say) But
these last words and speech / which does pronunce and show the
resurrection / does conclude and comprehend the ^umme and effect of all the
hole perfection / with co^pendiouse breffnes / does he not here openly call
this clause the last? And these.ii. words vita^ eternal Everlasting life:
seem to have been added of some man either out of the symbol of Athanasius: or
^ls out of that Creed / which is song in the mass. Neither does saint
Augustine read any other wise in his little book made of the Symbol / save only
/ that for de spiritu sancto: he redeth per spiritum sanctum / and whether he
did add this clause vitam ^ternam or no it is not very euydente: but it is
very probable and lykely / that he does agree with Cipriane / dowtles he
touches not this perceille he went down to hell: neither does he add this
pronoune huius carnis of this flesh. And Cipriane / seeing that he has showed
in other points / if there were any discrepaunce or variannce: he would also
no doubt of it have given knowledge in other things / if it had been any
otherwhise in the Roman Symbol / than himself does recyte. DIS. Seeing that
there is so greatte diversity and variete in so few words: what shame is
there in them (and such there be certain) which do fastly affirm with
asseueration / that this symbol was made and given of the Apostles by common
assente / and that also in writynge? For who durst be so bold to add unto
orels to take away even but one title from the writynge of any Apostle: which
so ever he were? MAG. A certain king of the Lacedemonian^s / when he was asked
of a certain person / why the officers called Ephori did not rise up and give
reverence to the king: made answer and said / even for this cause: because
they are Ephori. So likewise may I now make the / answer / they do affirm
this after such manner / even for this cause: because they are men / if they
have read any thing in their works / which have written of late time: that
do they hold fast / and cleue unto with tothe and nail / but if a man do
alledg or bring forth unto them any thing of the old authoures / which
they do not read (such is the scrupulouse fear of them) they do suspecte and
mistruste (as it is in the proverb) that under every stone does sleep a
scorpion. DIS. Is not this than the symbol of the Apostles? MAG. yes werily /
for what so ever is taught here in this Creed / the Apostles did learn of
Christ / and that which they had learned of him: they have truly and
faythefully taught to us. A few words / do not change the unchangeable
veryte. But these things now set a part (if thou think it best) make
recourse again from the beginning to the endyng / and demand of every thing
particularly / in such wise as the spirit shall put into thy mind. DIS. you
have showed and taught unto me / wh^ the first place or beginning is geu^ ^o
the father / that is to wit / for that he is the fou^tayne or spryng of the
hole godhede / and all creatures. But why does it call the father only god /
and the son only lord / and the ghost nothing else but holy: seeing that
the deite of them three is all one? The common usage of the scripture in
speaking of the persons of the godhed.
MAG. This is the coustome and usage of the holy scripture / that otherwhiles
when it does speak of the persons: it does sygnyfie the father by this name
god / as for exaumple / our lord himself says in the Gospel. if you do
believe in god believe also in me / and saint Paul says. Iha^n. xiii.
God was in Christ reconcilynge the world to himself. Again God has not
spared his own son. But of innumerable places in the scripture it is
manifest and euidente: that it is one and the same godhed of them all three /
when our lord says in the gospel these words.

Baptizinge them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy
ghost. Math. 48.
None of all the.iii. persons is called by this name god: to thentente / that
we should understand and perceive them all three to be one god. For only god
does through faith and baptism forgive sins. Other whiles also the same
scriptures do signify the sonn^ / by the name of god / as when we do say /
that god was made man for the salvation of mankind / was borne of a virgin /
was dead / and rose again from death to life. For neither did the father
neither the holy ghost / take upon them the nature of man / or suffer death.
DI. May it by onye sensible argument or token be declared and showed / how
the three persons are said to be dystyncte and sondrye one from another: and
yet are one god? MAG. There is nothing among creatures: which proprelye may
be said to be like to the nature of god.

Neither are there any words of men / with which we may proprelye speak of
it / neither are there any images or similitudes of man's mind / which may
perfightly agree unto the divine essence. And injury is don to that
incomparable majesty always to be had in honor: if it be rashely and over
boldlye compared with natural and worldly things. How be it yet / I shall
show the a certane similitude / but far unlike to it. The first similitude
of the son and the son beams / and the heat caused of the son: and his
b^ames.
Behold and considre the son / and the beams that come from it / and than
the heat / that comes forth and is caused of them both. As the son is the
fountain / out of which comes both the light / and the heat: so is the
father the fountain out of which yssueth the son / which is light of
light. And as of the son and of the bealmes both together / comes the heat
or warmnes so from the father and the son both together / proceeds and
comethe forth the holy ghost Now imagine me / that there were a son /
which never had beginning / neither ever shall have endyng: should there not
than of this son come forth eternal bealmes? and should also there not from
them both proceed heat egally etarnall with them both? DIS. yes dowtles.
MAG. The.ii. similitude of the mind / reason and will.
This collation and similitude also pleases some men / Mind / Reason / and
will / are all in. but one and the same soul. The mind is the fountain and
orygynall / reason that comes of it does judge / and the will that proceeds
and issuethe from them both^ does love. So likewise the father is the
fou^tayne: the son is logos / that is to say / reason. The holy ghost is
charity or love. The.iii. s^m^litude and most^ allowed.
The third similitude: and which is most allowed of learned men: is of the
mind / and of the word conceived in the mind. Now if there were a mind /
that were increated: dowtles the word of that mind also should be increated.
But that we may comprehend the holy ghost also in this similitude / let us
imagine first a mind / and seco^daryly a word brought forth and gendred of
it / and in such wise stryekynge the ears of other men: that yet never the
less it did remain and abide stylle in the heart / than thyrdly the breath /
with out which the mind does not utter or pronounce the word. The father is
the mind / the son: is the word conceived in the mind / the holy ghost:
is the pronunciation and vtteraunce. The.iii. simitude.
The father also after a certain manner may be lykened to the fountain or
spring / the son^e to the river / that comes forth of the spring. The holy
ghost to the fertilite and plenteousnes of the feldes / which the spryng
gives or causes by or through the river. There can be no perfighte simylytudes
taken of any creatures / to declare the mysteries of the godhed sufficientlye.
But in these exau^ples / there are exceeding many things dysagreyng and
unlike to the persons in the godhede. For the beam is not the same thing
that is the son: admytted that it be a substance. And the heat is but an
accydente: and not a substance / so far is it away from being all one with
the son / and with the beams. And our word is an accide^te and a tra^sitory
thing / and the breath wherewith we do utter and pronounce the w^rde / is an
accide^te (for that it is the mouyng of the ayere) likewise as the fertilite
also of the feldes is no substance: neither is it all one and the same thing
with the fountain and the river / wherefore let us lay a part these
symylitud^s and lykenesses. And that thing / which man's reason can not
attain unto nor perceive / let faith hold and steadfastly believe. That thing
which holy scripture does tea^he which Christ being corporallye in ^arth did
teach / which has been confirmed with so many miracles / which the spirit
of Christ does teach by the church: that thing (I say) is to be accounted
and taken for more certain and undoubted / than is that thing / which has been proved by a thousand evident and plain demonstrations / or which thou
doste perceive.vi.C. bodyly senses: if thou had so many. DIS. Is it not
lawful than to inquyere / and make search of the divine things? MA. To whom
and how far forth it is lawful to enserche of godly things.
yes verily it is lawful namely to those which have their wits well
exercised but it must be done with dread / it must be done sobrelye / it must
be done / after that they have set a sure fundation or ground warke of
faith / finally as far forth / and no farther: than is graun^ed to man in
this mortal ly^e / in which we do see god by faith: But as i^ were in a
glass / and in a ryddle and obscure manner. For else to speak of the diuin^
nature / even so as it is in very deed / not the very minds of au^geles are
able to comprehend it / so that there is place even there unto faith which does
believe that thing / which passes all reason and understanding of any
creature created. Therefore by good right the first word of this philosophy is
Credo I believe. Credo.
DIS. Two syllables? MA. ye / but who so ever speaks these two syllabes from
his very heart / unfeignedly: he is blessed. For no man does believe verylye and
truly in god: who only does verelye believe in god
but only he / which does take for certain and undoubted things / what so
ever things are written in the books of the holy scripture / hopyng without any
doutfullnes or dystruste all such things / as the said scriptures do promise.
And which in this life does put himself / and his / and all his goods / unto
the will of god: forsakynge and renouncing his own will in all things.
Although a thousand deaths were threttened unto him / and though all the hole
power of the deuylles would go about to do him myscheffe: he is very sure and
saffe from all daungere / who so ever has settled him self fast on this rock
/ if this faith do want or fail: neither does baptism / neither any
sacraments of the church proufighte any whitte or avail: nether does any
good works help any whit^ to eternal salvation. For Paul does pro^ounce i^
to be sin: what so ever is without faith. The co^me^dation of Faith.
This faith coupleth and ioynethe us to god the father / this same does
associate us to Christ our head / this same faith / by the spirit of Christ
/ does make us to be chosen and taken into the noumbre of the sons of god.
This same faith / does graffe us into the eternal company and felowshyppe of
Aungells / and of all holy saints. This faith does shine before us / and give
us light in the darkness of this life: sheweng what is verily to be eschewed /
and what to be followed and desired. This faith does arm us / and make us bold
without any fear / and invincible against all the engynes / and all the
ordinance of the world and of the deuille. This faith does mightily and
effectuesly coumfor^ us in trybulation and aduersite: with the hope of the
heavenly good or felicite / having this saying always in her mouth if god be on
our syed: who can be against us? And that saying also. The afflictions and
tribulatio^s of this world / are not worthy of the glory to come / which
shall be showed in us. This faith does truly quiet and set at rest the
mind of man. Of this faith after the mind of saint Paul does come: and
unto it is to be wihted or imputed / what so ever thing at any time has been
don strongely / vertuosly / and temperately / of such as have been excellent
in holiness. By this faith we do live well beloved of God: by this faith / we
do dye cherefullye / and with good trust toward god / by this faith we are
created up unto blessed immortalyte Again of the defaulte and want of faith
what euylles do spring of vnbeleffe.
springs superstition / sorcerie / idolatry and covetousness cosen to it /
Ambition / Blasphemy / heaviness / desperation / pride fear of death / desire of
vengeance / finally what so ever vices or sins do raygne in the hole
world. DIS. Uerily I do here many men oftentimes wyshynge to themselves /
prosperouse health / long life / and riches. But I do here very few men /
that do desyere this so excellentely a good gift of god.

MAG. No marvel thereof / for verily there are but few: that do know what
thing / and after what manner is to be desired and prayed for. For this gift
of faith: it were mete and conuenyente / contynually and Luce. x^.
without ceassyng to knock at the ears of god / that he would vouchesaffe to
give us faith: and to encreace his gift in us every day more and more.
DISC. yet never the less the comune sort and most part of men do call
those that are not very wise: Credulos / that is to say redye to give
credence. And a certain wise man of the Hebrews does name those persons
leaves cord: light minded: which do easylye and soon give crede^ce. MAG.
First it is no point neither of lyghtnes / neither of credulite to give
credence to those things: which things: it has by so many arguments and
euydente tokens ben declared: to come not from men: but from god. Paul says:
that he would not give credence: Galat. ^.
no not even to an Angel if he did teach any thing dissonaunt or
dysagreynge from the Gospelle of Christ. But rather it is a point of
arrogance and presumptuose folyshenes: to dowte of these things: which have been taught and given to us with so greatte authorite: and therefore: saint
Paul writes / Roma. i.
that the folishe heart of the philosophers was blinded: because the light of
fathe was absente if any man being unlettered / would babble and strive against
such a philosopher / as was Arystot^le or Pythagoras / or if there have been
any other conynger tha^ either of the^ both / when he did dyspute de materia
prima / of the principles and causes of things / de infinito / or of the
largenes / the mouynge: and the virtue of the heavenly speres / and would dowte
of every thing / that himself could not by his one wit attayn^ unto / and
perceive: should he not be called an arroga^t and mad fool? But how much
greatter madness is it / there fore not to give credence to the divine
philosophy: because man's understanding can not attain to the perceiving
of many^ things? And there is by a thousand parts more difference between god
and man / be he never so greatly learned: tha^ is between the wiseste man that
is / and the most folyshe swyneherde that is. DI. It is even very so in deed.
MA. Among philosophers / he is accounted a person shameless: if any man would
reiecte and not receive the authorite of an excellen^ and a good approved
authoure (for the dyscyples of Pythagoras thought it enoughe to cause
persuasion and beleffe of any thing to say (ipse dixit) our master Pythagoras
said it) And does he that is a Christen man: Ipse dixit.
draw back / and be hard to give credence: when he hears these words. God
has said this. God has done this? Of the kings writ no man does dowte /
if it be so / that he know the kings seal at it / how great folyshenes and
presumption is it than / to dowte of the divine things which are so many manner
ways sealed as we have shewde before? DI. whils you do reasone and dispute
these things I do perceive and feel the sede of faith to encreace even in me
also. But why does this form and manner of speaking please them / Credo in
deu^: which good and pure Latin men do scasely acknowledge and allow? MA. Many
philosophers also credideru^t deum: Credere deu^.
that is: did believe: that there is god. And the deuylles also credu^t deo:
Credere deo.
that is to say give credence to god. For they know / that he can not lie. But
only good and vertuose men Credece in deum or in deo.
credunt in deum / or in deo: which have set their hole trust and confidence /
and their hole hope steadfastly in god. Only good and vertuose men Credunt in
deu^: do believe or trust in god.
Wherefore saint Cipriane being a man both learned / and also holy: does not
think / that we should read in this wise. Credo in sanctam ecclesiam: but
credo sanctam ecclesiam. And verily I do knowledge and grant this sense of
his: to be a holy and a godly sense / for the greattest and the shote ancre of
our confidence and hope / is not to be fastely set: but onely^ in god / but in
very deed this figure or manner of speaking / was taken of the propretie of the
Hebrew tongue. Which oftentimes does use to add and put to / the preposition
in: where the latyne tongue does not suffer it. And the Apostles / although
they wrote in greek yet for all that do otherwhiles express and follow the
propriete of their natyue language / as for exau^ple / in the.iiii. chapitoure
of Luke. Luce. xiiii.
Si potest in dece^ milibus occurrere. Whether he beable with.x. thousand to
withstand him. Now if it were in no wise lawfulle to add this preposition in
/ so often as we do speak of humane things: how shall we excuse that / which
saint Luke the Euangelyste writheth in the.xii. chapitoure.

Qui in me confessus sucrit coram hominibus: et filius hominis confitebitur in
illo coram angelis (id est) Luce. xi^.
who so ever shall confess and knowledge me before men: the son of man also
shall acknowledge him before the Angels of god? But yet the preposytion does
seem to add some strength or pithe to the oration or speech. To say Confido
in te: I can not tell / whether it be good and pure Latyne. But fiduciam habeo
in te (id est) I have trust in the. And in te spes mea sita est (id est) my
hope is set in the: is well said / though Spero in te / those men dare not
say: which do somewhat relygiouslye and preciselye observe the elegauncie of
the Latyne speech. Where fore let us now pass over the dysputation of the
form and manner of speaking / how it may be excused / and let us embrace
the thing it self with our hole heart and mind / layenge up all our hole
hope / neither in Aungells / neither in holy men: but only in god. DIS. Why
does it not say. Credo in vnum deum (that is tho say) I believe in one god?
MAGISTER. Because he that does now speak so / does more stronglye and
effectually exclude the pluralyte and multitude of gods. For no man does
speak in this wise (vidi vnum sole^: id est: I have seen one son. Exortus
est vnus sol: id est: one son is risen / vidi vnam lunam: id est: I have seen
one moon) For as much as never so much as this imagination does come in to
the mind of any man: that there is: or can be mo sons or mo moons tha^ one.
But he that says I have seen one son risyng does put the hearers in dowte /
as though he did think / that there were many sons or many moons / and
who so ever would use that manner of speaking: should be accounted for a fool /
and laughed to scorn. For that thing / that is absolutely and symplycyter
highest: can be but one thing. DIS. Why is it than said in this symbol
(which as certain men do wene / was made in the council holden at Nice. The
creed which is song at mass: was made in the cou^cellholden at Co^sta^tinople.
But as thou doste suppose / was made in the council holde^ at Constantinople)
that I here songen in the mass. Credo in vnu^ deum: id est: I believe in one
god? MA. why this word vnum was added.
This word vnum was added and put to afterward / not so much against the
hethen Paynymes / which did worshype many gods as against heretykes. Among
whom: some did dream: that there are duo principia (id est) two principles or
cheffe causes the one of good: and the other of euylle. Other some again did
divide one god into two gods the one of the^: whom they called ryghtuose
god: they did affirm to be the authoure of the old testamente / and the other
of them they said to be the authoure of the new testamente: whom they did
profess to be a good god / but not rightuose: where as in very deed: there is
but only one god / the maker of all good creatures. For of evil things: god
is not the authoure. Genesis.i.
For he considred all things / which he had made and created and they were
very good. The same god is ryghtuose and good. The same is the authoure of the
old law: and also the authoure of the new testamente. And the same is the
vnmutable governor of all times. But when I do say / that god is not the
Authoure of euylles: I mean of sins / and not of afflictions or
tribulations. Affliction is good / for.iii skylles.
For the affliction or tribulation / which god does send to men: is good /
either because it is rightuose / as when it is laid upon us for our sins: or
else because it is a medicine to make us repent and wax wise: or else because
it is the matter and occasion of greater glory which kind of cuylles for all
that / should never have been among men: if there had never ben sin / and
sin came of the devil and of the corrupted concupisce^ce of man. DI. why
does it add patre^ father? MA. For a distinction of him from the other
persons / for it follows anon after. Et in Iesum Christu^ filium eius
vn^cu^. And in Jesus Christ his only son / he alone is called father:
because he alone begat the son. How be it if this word god be so taken /
that it do declare the hole trinite / and do co^prehende all the.iii. persons
together / than is god well called a father / because he is the beginning and
original cause of all things created. And if thou understand this word
father in a general sense / for that / of which any thing takes original
beginning / than is the first person father simpliciter of all things / he
has not begotten the holy ghost but no more has he begotten neither man /
nor angel of his one substance. But because after a peculiare manner he is
said to be the father of those / that do dread or fear him: after the same
manner he is said to be the god of them in the.xxxii. Psalm. Blessed is the
nation or poeple: which have the lord to their god. And likewise in
the.c^liii. ps. But that god has begotten a son of his oune substance this
is proprely belo^gyng to the first person / he created the world: Iacobi. i.
but not he alone / he begets good men through the word of life: but he does
it by the son: and by the holy ghost. But the only son: none save the
father alone has begotten. D. what? likewise as one man begets another man?
MA. ye likewise forsooth in these points that he begatte a son / and that he
begatte god of god. But as I have said before in every collation or comparison
and similitude / which is translated from creatures unto god: there are many
things disagreynge and far unlike. For neither the father does transfuse or
give from hy^ any part of his substance into the son: but he has
co^mu^icated the same hole substance to his son: neither do he that
begets: and he that is begotten make two gods: so as the father being a
man and the son^e being a man do make.ii. men)

Neither is the person that begets: in time any whit before the person /
that is begotten: but the eternite of them both is all one. I pass over to
reherce other things / wiche are innumerable. DI. when one man adopteth / or
of favor takes another man unto his son: he does not verily begette him.
But wha^ he has a son by his wife: than he is said to have verylye begotten
a son / because he has don it according to nature: if it be so than / as
you do say / that the father does begette the son / so many manner ways
unlike to the facio^ that a man begets a son: how can he be said verily
to begette him? M. yes verily / he does by so much the more truly begette: in
that he does begette in unlike manner unto man: that is to say / he does so
much the more perfightlye begette. For the generation of man / compared unto
that unspeakable generation / it is but only a certain shadow of generation.
For if it be called among us true generation / because it is according to the
nature of man: much more ryghtefully that is called true generation / which is
according to the nature of god. Except peradventure thou will say / that god
has not verily and truly made the world / because he has made it far
otherwise tha^ a man does make a city or a house. Neither is god therefore not
said to be verily light / life / wisdom / power / mind / because these
words are otherwise said of the^ / than of god. D. Is it lawful to call god
a substance? MAG. if by a substance thou doste sygnifie and betoken a person
which has being: it is not wickedlye said / if thou do profess one essence
to be in three substaunces. How be it yet it is better to refrain from these
words / which certain holy me^ have used in the old time: at the least wise
because of the strauugenes of them / if by substance / thou do understand
that to which accidents are inherente: than is i^ error to give this name
to god / which is most simple: neither being made of matere and form:
neither mengled with accidents: but what so ever is in him / is one and a
singule substance. And if any such manner words be given to god in the holy
scripture / as for exaumple / if we do read / that god is angry / that god is
pacified / that god does repente^ that god does forgete / that god ^oth
remember: know thou that in all such places / the scripture does atte^pre and
shape her language according to our wits and capacite / even likewise as a
loving mother does lyspe and speak vnper^^ightely / when she speaks to her
young babe. But if thou call a substance / a thing substauncially being of
it self: than is there nothing / whereunto this word substance does better
agree: than unto god. For by him it has being / what so ever has verily
being / now than he him self must needs have most perfightlye being:
which geuethe to all things their being. DISC. These things / me seems /
have been holyly and plainly disputed of you. But seeing that there are many
other words / which be agreyng / and ben attributed unto god / as wisdom /
goodness / eternite / vnchau^geablenes troth / justice / mercy and many other
such innumerable: why is god here expressly called oi^pote^te / and nothing
else? why god is only called almighty in the Creed.
M. Forsooth thou do ask and demand full wisely / for who so ever does truly
profess god / i^ so doing / he does also profess all things which be agreyng
and belonging to the nature of god. But ^or as much as in this Symbol the
things are taught to beg ynners / which are to be believed raither than to be
discussed: and because there are very many things not only in the creation of
the world / but also in the redemption and the co^summation of the same /
which do seem impossible to man's reason and judgment therefore to exclude
all such manner reasonynge / is added here this word almighty. When Aristotel
does reasone / and prove by insoluble arguments / that this world has been
eternally without any beginning / because that of nothing naught ca^ be made:
we do answer: that he is almighty which created the world of naught.
Philosophers do say / that there can be no retourninge or recourse from the
pryuation to the habit and therefore that neither Christ was borne of a
virgin: neither has risen from death to life / but we do make answer unto
them / that god is almighty / which works these things. The jews do deny
/ that a man can be borne of a woman whitout man's help but we do make
au^swer / yt it is god / which wylled this to be don / which was borne / which
did prepare the womb of the virgin. Therefore to confirm the faith and beleffe
of weak persons no word does make or help mor tha^ does this word almighty
But we ought to say with the faithful maker of the Psalms. Psalm. cxxxiiii.
The lord has made all things / what so ever it has lyked him / in heaven
and in earth: in the sea / and in all deep waters. DI. Creatorem celi et terre
(id est) the creatoure of heaven and of earth. ^hy is the father only called
the creatoure of the world? MAG. Forsooth the creation of the world is common
to all the three persons. For the father has made all creatures by the son /
the holy ghost workynge together with them both. But yet in such wise: that
thou may not imagine here neither any instrument neither yet any mynyster.
But it was conueniente and according / that the beginning of the euangelycall
profession should be consonaunte and agreeable with the beginning of the old
testamente / that we might at the least eue^ hereby perceive and understand
/ that the authoure of both laws is all one. Thus begins the book of
Genesis. In the beginning God did create both heaven and earth. Genesis.i.
Now the Jews (I speak of the common sort and the most part of them) knew
nothing at all of the son / and of the holy ghost / they knew only the
father / not because he has begotten the son being also god but because he
was the maker and the gouernoure of mankind / and the fountain and original
cause of all creatures. For this word Father is a word beto kenynge
beginning / and it is euydent and undoubted / that the most perfighte nature
and manner of a beginning or original cause / is in the father. Father.
For as much as he alone (as saint Cipriane says) is without any authoure or
father: which only is the authoure of al things without exception. DIS. why
does some other call him Creatorem / and some again call him Factore^: whom
he does here call Conditorem? MA. The Greeks have but only one word Poutin
which is common to signify authorem / creatorem / and factorem (id est) an
authoure / a creatoure / and a maker / after what so ever manner it be: that he
does make / how be it the Latyne tongue does refuse this word Factor. Certain
men / for cause of a distinction and difference to be had: have taught: that
he does create: which does bry^ge for the and make somewhat of nothing /
which belongs only to god / and that he does make which frames or
shapeth any thing of some matere or stuff / as for exau^ple / nature gendreth
and brings forth the tree / of the sede / and ye goldesmyth does make a piece
or a goblet / of silver. It comes therefore i^ to disputation / whether god had
created heaven and earth / for as mu^he as there seems to have been / Chaos
before he made the world (that is to say a matter or stuff without any shape
or fassio^) he did not therefore creat the world of naught / how be it yet it
may be well said / that he made it of naught: seeing that he made the same
thing / whereof al things have been made To thente^t therefore / that all such
subtle argumentations should be excluded: certain men hade lever use this
word co^ditorem. DIS. why did he raith^r call him conditorem celi et terre
(idest) the maker of heaven and of earth / than conditorem universe creature
(id est) the maker of all creatures: MAG. Because (as I said right now) he
had lever cou^trefayte and follow the words of the beginning of the book
Genesis. Heaven co^prehendeth and contains all things. About the earth / all
the other elements do move round. These two parts of the world are most set
forth unto our senses. And the scripture (as I told you right now) does
oftentimes attempre and shape her speech: according to man's wits and
capacite. He that has made heaven and earth: has dowt^es made all things
which are contained in them. DIS. But the symbol called Symbolu^ Nicenum / or
symbolum Constantinopolitanum: does add these words visibilium omnium and
inuisibilium (that is to say) the maker of all things both visible and
vnuysyble. MAG. That same Creed says the same thing / that does this creed /
but it speaks more plainly and euydently: lest any man should think / that
Aungelles / or the souls of men were not created of god. That thing which is
said here covertly: saint Paul the Apostle does expresslye pronounce / in the
first Chapitour to the Collossianes. i. Collos. ^.
For by him all things were made / in heaven and in earth: both visible
things and unvisible things whether they be thrones / or dominations / or
pucipates / or potestates / all things have been made by him and in him what so
ever thing had never begi^nynge But the aungelles are the ministers of god /
whom they do contynually without ceassyng / reverently with dread / glorify
and worship: as there maker and lord. And what so ever thing has had
beginning: it has had his original beginning of god only / which alone
neither has had beginning / neither ever shall have ending / neither is
contained i^ place: neither is moved i^ time. DIS. What remains now: but that
we may go unto the secounde article? MA. I think it better to tarry somewhat
also about this article. DIS. I am ready to do: as shall please you. MA. The
first degree than unto health: is Credere deum esse (id est) to believe / that
there is god. The second is Credere de^ that is / to give credence vnto^goddes
words. The third is / to cast all our thought and mind upon him with full
confidence and trust. He that does not believe / that god is: he professes
nothing to be at all / in as much as all things that are: are of god. He
that believes god / which is Credere de^: he does profess him to be true in
all things. He that puts al his trust in god / professethe that all things
are governed of him / and that there is nothing neither better nor wyser than
he. who so ever douteth of these latter things: he does not truly believe /
that first thing that is to wete that god is. For no man does truly believe
that god is: which does feign or ymagine him to be otherwise than he is / ye
moreover they do the more shamefully err of both / which when they do
profess that there is god / yet for all that do deny that he is almighty / or
alknowyng orels do deny that the world was made by him / and ^^f it were made
of him: yet do deny / that it is governed of him. Even likewise as thou thy
self (if I be not begyl^d) would be less disconte^ted with him / which should
suppose or wene / that thou art not borne: than with him / which did believe /
that thou haste no senses or man's reason / and such other things / without
which a man leseth the name of a man. D. For sothe it is even very so: as you
do say. M. He that names a king: does in this one word comprehend many
excellent things / he that names god: in this one word does co^prehende an
infinite sum of all good things. Many men say with their mouth. Cred^ in
deum. I believe in god / but he which with a christen mind does say I believe
in god: first he does hate and defy certain paganes / which do not believe
/ that there is any god at al. And he does no less hate them / which do
number and reckon up unto us many and many fold gods: It is all one thing
in effect, to say that there are many gods and to say, that there is no god
at all.
where as in so saying / they do grant that there is no god at al. For if
there be many gods: than is there some what / where in one of them does
differ from another / now if that be any good thing: he is no god / that
lacks or wants any thing that good is. And if it be an evil thing: than
can he not be god / that has any evil in him. Likewise he does hate them /
which do think nothing to be at all / save only such things / whereof they
have perceiving by their bodyly senses. Anthropomorphite.
To whom the Anthropomorphites are not much unlike / which / because they do
read in the scriptures / of the eyes / the face / the mouth / the hands / the
heart / the arm / the w^mbe / and the breast of god: they did wene / that god
is a bodily thing made of manes shape and manes members / when in very deed
nothing is forther from all sensible matter / tha^ god is / and Johan also
does write. Ioha^nis.iiii.
That god is a spirit. Moreover he does abhor^e the Epicureis / which do so
grant one god / or mo than one to be: The opinion of the Epicures.
that yet they do deny him or them to care any whitte what is done in the
world. These that be of this opinion / do make god either impotente / orels
folishe / in that they do reckon him either not able to govern that / which
he has created / orels so evil will / that he will not do it / orels so
folyshe and dronken: that he does not retche therefore. These things / if they
were said against any mortal prince: they were words full of blasphemy. How
much more than / if they be spoken against god? But our lord in the gospel
says plainly. Math. x^
That there does not so much as a little sparowe fall upon the ground /
without the will of the father. And also / that all the hears of his discip^es
hedes are noumbred. * So that not so much as one ly^le hear does peryshe /
except it be by his will. And sayncte Peter agreably unto these words of his
master / says. i. Petri. ^^
Casting all your care and thought upon him: for he has care and mind of
you. The same does also detestate ye blasphemy of the Ieues / which do
profess one god: The error of the Jews.
but they do deny the son and the holy ghost / when in very deed the
substance or essence of god is so one: that it is even the same and (to speak
after the manner of logicions) eadem numero the same in noumbre. The substance
of the godhed / is al one and the same i^ all the iii. persons.
Both in the son / which was begotten of the father / and also in the holy
ghost / procedynge from them both. The father cries from the clouds. This
is my well-beloved son. Math. xvii. et Luce. iii.
and the Jew cries against it that he has no son. The same father cries
by the mouth of his prophet Iohel. Iohelis.ii^.
I shall pour out of my spirit upon all flesh. And the Jew cries there
against / god has no holy ghost / but is solitary. Agreyng unto this madness
was folyshe and ignorant Noetus / Noetus.
and the wicked heretic Gabellius / Gabellius.
of whom sprung the heresy and sect of them / which were called Patrispassia^:
The patrispassianes.
which did divide the substance of god not into three persons. but into three
voices or names. The father (said they) created the world / the same in ye
name of the son: took upon him the nature of man / and suffered passion. The
same again / only his name changed / and now called the holy ghost: came down
upon the disciples. Here wittyngly and gladly / I pass over the dremes more
than blas^hemouse: of Basilides Basilides.
and Mercio. Marcio.
The Origenistes Origenistes.
also do come very nere unto the impiete and wicked error of the Jews /
which do make the son of god a creature / and the holy ghost the minister of
that creature / Cosen to these / also is Arrius / which granted that the
father has a son / but only of will and lykenes: Arrius.
and not of nature. How be it he will also this similitude to be v^perfighte /
after such facion / as the shadow is like to the body: because he does
think / that between the creatoure and the creature there can not be but a
slendre and an obscure similitude. Eunomius.
But Eunomius does far excede the heresy of this said Arryus / which taught
that the son is in all points unlike to the father: because that there is
none affinite or likeness and agreme^te between the creatoure and the creature:
no more than is between a thing that is infinite / and a thing that is finite.
From this Eunomius / Macedonius does so dyssente: Macedonius
that yet he does not assente unto the doctrine of the church. For he grants
the son to be in all points like unto the father but he says / that the
holy ghost has no point common with the father and the son. Manicheis.
Of the Manicheis we have touched somewhat all redye / which whils they do
make duo principia (id est) two principles contrary / the one to the other of
the one of which / visible things (as they say) were created / as ^uyll
things of an evil pncyple / and of the other / invisible things / were
created as good things of a good pnciple) without dowt they do of one god make
two gods / ye one good and ye other euel / eue^ likewise as do ye heretics
called Gnostici / Synerus / Synerus.
whils he makes tria principia.iii. princyples he makes as many gods /
again those that do separate and depart the son or the holy ghost from god /
where as in very deed they do cleue unto him by nature they do go abowte to
thruste unto us a maimed or an vnperfight god. Also there are some which instead of god: Nature.
do recke^ nature to be the cause of al things: which if it be eternal / and
almighty: forsooth than it is god / if it be not such one than is it ye minister
of god / and a creatur made of god. The same thing is to be judged (as I
supose) of the second causes / how be it i^ my judgment it is more agreing to
the Christian religion / what so ever either nature / or else the secondary
causes do work: The seco^dari causes.
all that to ascribe and give unto ye efficacy and mighty workyng of god only
which if it should cease: neither the son should give light: neither the fire
should be hot / but all things should be suddenly brought to naught / he does
also execrat Selencus / which does grant that god made the world: Selencus.
but he says / that the matter or stuff whereof he made it / was eternal and
without beginning / making a thing without shape or facion and vnperfight egal
unto god he does also execrat and has the opinion of Menander / which folowi^g
Plato / did teach / yt the world was not made of god: Mena^der.
but of au^geles calling angels / those whom Plato calls sprytes the sons
of the cheffe and pncipal gods. Saturnius.
And he hates also Saturnius which is more shameful out of the right opinion
tha^ these before reherced / which dr^amed the world to have been made of seven
angels / and also he hat^th Basilides most shamefully errig of al other:
Basilides.
which said yt the world was created of heaven. But now I am werye to speak
onye more of erroures and heresies: which are innumerable and without end.
Breffly and generally who so ever thinks of god otherwise / than he is in
very deed / or else does not think him to be such one / as the auctorite of
the divine scripture has described him unto us: that perso^e does not believe
and trust in god but he puts his hope in an idol.

Thou see here / hou great philosophy and wisdom this one so short an
article has taught us: and from how great darkness and monstruose erroures it
has deliuerd us. DIS. Forsooth now I perceive and see well / that it is a
greatte thing to say unfeignedly and with the heart. It is no small thing to
say truly from the heart: Credo in deum.
Credo in deum: id est: I believe and trust in god. MAG. ye thou wol dest even
much more say this: if thou dydest reckon and considre / hou great a
multitude of men there is / upon whom saint Paul's saying may be verified.
Tit. i.
They profess themselves to know god: but in their deeds they do deny him.
Nota.
what so ever thing man does prefer before god / and more set by / than by
god: that same thing he makes a god to himself. DIS. How so? MA. God says
/ what so ever thing man does love and regard more tha^ god: that thing he
makes his god.
thou shalt not do none adultery / nor fornication. The concupiscence and
lust of the flesh byddeth the to commit adultery / here who so ever not
regarding god / does obaye his concupiscence and lust / does he not after a
certain manner forsake god and i^ his place set up his own concupiscence: DIS.
It appears so. MAG. God says / Do not forswear the / or do no perjury / and
Covetousness byddeth a man to do periurye / does not the couetouse man here in
the sted of the very and true god worship Mammon? The scripture teaches us /
that god is psente eueriwhere and that there is nothing hid from his iyes.
Hebre.iiii.
But do those men believe this: which daily do commit that thing under the
iyes of god / which they durst not be bold to co^mite in the presence and sight
of man? DI. It appereth^ that no. M. They: which for the death of their
children / or for their wares or goods taken from them / do hang themselves
/ or otherwise for do themselves / do those persons believe / that all the
world and worldly things are wisely and mercifully governed of god? DIS. It is
marvel: if they do verily believe so. MAGIS. They that with their hole heart
and mind all their life time do serve the world.

Prouer. ii.
Being merry when they have done evil / and reioysynge in sin and
vngratious^es: do these men believe / that god does suffer none evil deed
vnponyshed / but that they / which would not here make amends for thyr sins
by repentance / are sent into everlasting fire? DIS. In my judgment /
either they do not believe it: or else it is but a very cold and faint beleffe /
that they have of it. MAG. Again they that considering the greatness and
grauyte of there offenses / do despeyre of forgeuenes / do those persons believe
/ that god is of infynyte mercy? DIS. It is not very lykely / that they do.
MAG. It is therefore a thing of no little wayghte / and no little helping unto a
godly and blessed life: a man with a quycke and lyuelye faith to know the
very god. who so ever unfeignedly / and from the heart does believe / that he
is most perfyghtelye good / and most perfyghtlye fair: how can he love onye
thing above him? And who so ever believes that he is almyghtye: will not goo
abowte too resyste him / that can not be ouercomen who so ever believes / that
he is of most high and perfyghte wisdom: that person will never grudge
against god in aduersyte and trybulatyon. For as that man might seem and be
accounted lewede by the judgment of all men which being himself unlearned /
would find faughte with the physician / and would rebuke him / for that he
does prescribe sundry things to sundry bodies: so likewise he should be
utterly folyshe and without wit / which would judge god in like manner as
though he knew not / what is best for every man. The physician does anoynte
and bathe one man / another man he seareth and cutteth / another / he does
let blood / to another he mynystrethe a clyster / or gives a laxatyue
medycyne / too another he gives a byndynge medycyne.

To some man he comaundeth abstynence. To a another he prescrybeth certain
kinds of meattes / he counsaylethe one man to rest and sleep / another he
does forbydde to sleep / and we do say: he is a physycyon / he knows what
is expedyente for the person being sick and dyseased. And when god gives to
one man riches: and does take the same away from another / does send to some
man children: and to another sends none at all / and to one man gives
prosperouse health / and to another sendethe a body full of sicknesses and
diseases: do we say / why does god handle men after this facion? and do we not
rayther say: he is god / and knows what is expedyente for every man? He that
beleuethe god to be most ryghtuose: he will never promise himself to escape
vnponished for his misdedes. And who so ever beleuethe / that he does know
all things: that man will not lightly do that thing in the syghte of god /
which he would be ashamed to do in the sight of a good and an honest man. who
so ever believes that he is most sothefast and true: will dread the pains or
ponisheme^tes / that are thretened to wicked men / and will have love and
desiere unto that eternal bliss / which is promised to good and vertuose
men. who so ever does believe / that ^his world was created for man's cause:
that person which way so ever ward he shall turn him self shall be stirred
and provoked to honor and worssyppe the great goodness and lyberalyte of god /
and he shall be afraid to use the things / which god has gras^ted to him:
otherwise / tha^ to his honor and glory. But let here be the end of this
communication. After that thou have made thy prayer to god / Leuitic^.x^.
and that thou shalt have chowed thye coode / like a clean beast (that is to
say) after that thou shalt have dylygently recorded these things / and
called them well to remembrance: than have recourse hither again unto me.

The third instruction.
Disciple. I Do feel and perceive / that mustarde sede / which thou haste
sowed in my mind: Mat. xiii.
to utter and show forth his virtue and strength more and more. MA. I pray
god / that when I have planted and watered it the lord may vouchesaffe to give
it increacynge / and growing even unto lawful and full ripenes. i. Corin. iii.
DISC. But as I considred and called to remembrance / what had been co^muned
and said between us: this one scrupule or dowte troubled my mind / for what
cause it should be / that where as in all other dyscyplynes and scyences they
do begin with the most easy and light things / and such as are famylyarlye
known to our senses: this heavenly phylosophye does forthwith at the beginning
speak of god / which is the highest thing / that can be / and most fartheste
from all man's se^ses? MA. Ueryly because this philosophy is a discyplyne of
beleffe: and not of disputation and reasonynge / for disquisition or reasonynge
does led man's mind far about by many compasyng and wyndyng ways and
often times also does begy^e it / and led it out of the right way. But faith
compendyously and sped^lye does carye and conuaye up to the highest / and
sets our mind as it were / in a high totyngehyll: from which it may more
certaynlye and perfyghtelye dyscerne and judge these inferyoure things /
referrynge all things to god / in whom is the begy^nynge: the increace / and
the perfection and full end of all things. The bodylye se^ses do other whiles
deceive us.
The knowledge / which rises of the senses / otherwhiles is uncertain /
because the bodyly senses do ofte^tymes deceive us / as for exau^ple / wha^ the
son seems ^o us two foot broad: where as in very deed it is greatter / than
the hole earth: and when we see the lyghtenyng: before that we here the thundre
/ and yet for all that / the syghte / and the hearing / are the cheffe and
principal among the out ward senses or wits. No nor yet the knowledge /
which is gathered of the causes or principles of demonstrations: is always
certain / for as much as we do see the professoures of wisdom / other whiles
to dowte even of the principles also. But in as much as faith coming from god
/ does pass the certaynte both of the senses and also of all pryncyples: The
sure^te: and most co^pendiouse: and easiest knowledge / i^ had by faith given of
god
there is no more sure knowledge / than is by faith / and none also more
compendiouse and more easy / will thou have a sure token here of? How many
weuers are there now a days / both men and women / which do talk and common
more wisely of god / and godly things tha^ did the cheffest of the
philosophers Plato and Aristotel? of the which two the former / that is to
wit Plato: how many mad opinions has he of the principal or hee^ gods /
and of the sprytes the sons of the gods / and of world made of ye spretes /
and of the soulles fale^ down from heaven. And the letter of the two / that is
to wit Aristotell / because he goes abowte to come up from the lowest
things to the higheste: by how many long ambages and coumpasses does he led
the wit? how long does he tarry them and keep them back in matters of Logike
/ of Poetry / of Rethorike / of Natural Philosophy / of high and celestial
things / before that he do come unto the supernatural things? And yet for all
this does he not come to the knowledge of god / for whose cause he had laid
these so many steps or stayres / unto which knowledge now by faith /
yongemen are promoted both shortly and easily: ye being instructed with no
manner humayne dysciplines. Joan. xvi^.
The cheffeste philosophye which purchases true beatitude unto man: is to
know god / and Jesus Christ sent of him. To the learning of this philosophy
/ because it is most agreeable and according to nature / every sex / and every
age / is apt and docyle / but that age inespecyall and most cheffly: which is
not yet infected with crooked and lewed affections and desyers. And verylye
relygyon is in so much according / to nature: that some certain perceyuyng
and fealynge thereof / is believed to be in Elephantes / and other brute beasts.
Plinius in naturali historia
D. But who so ever does sympely believe those things / which are written or
taught concerning god: that man shall not be able to match with philosophers
and heretics in disputacion. MA. Truth it is. Neque enim ha^c philosophia
iliscitur ad palestram sed ad piam vitam. Quid, autem arrog^^tius istis, qui
rationibus humanis de diuina n^tura ^isputant quu^ nullus sit illo^^ qui
cu^icis aut ara^eoli natural valeat ad plenu^ assequi, quis haec quotidie
vide^nt. Qui scrututor est magestatis^ opprimitur a gloria. non ali^er ^uam qui
solemn intentis immotisque oculis diutius intuentur, caecutientes discedu^t^ vt
iam interdum impingant and in palum obuuium. Fidei vero^ simplex columbinus'
The eye of faith is a simple eye: and not curiouse to est oculus, hac
reuerenter contemplans Deum qua nobis voluit innotescere'. to enserche such
things as god would to be hid and unknown to us, whils we live in this
world.
For this philosophy is not learned for to help to disputation: but to good
and godly living. Now what more presumption can there be than is in them /
which with worldly reasons do dispute of the nature of god: when there is none
of them all / which is able fully and perfightely to know but even the nature
of a gnatte or of a little spyeder / all though they do daily se these. who so
ever is an ensercher of gods majesty: is oppressed of the glory. None other
wise / than they / which do stare one while on the bright son with their eyes
steadfastly set and unmoved: do go away dased and half blind / in so much /
that otherwhyles they do stomble / and stryke themselves upon a stake being in
their way. But the eye of faith is a simple doves eye / reverently beholdynge
god that way / which way it is his pleasure to be known of us: but not
curiously enserchynge those things / which it is his will to have hyd from us
in the mean season / until we shall come to that heavenly theater: in which
he shall give himself to be seen more nere / and more clearly / to our eyes
being than more purged and clean. In this lyffe it is sufficient / that thou
know / that there is god / and that he is one in nature / and three by
distinction of persons. Thou perceiuest and know / that the son is
begotten and comes of the father / and that the holy ghost pro^edeth from
them both. Thou know that god is not a body: but a mind of i^finite virtue
and power / most simple / everlasting / as which has been before all times:
and is not changed in time. Of this all mighty mind thou know the whole
world to have been created / and created for man's cause / for god neither
has need of the world / nor of man / nor yet of any creature. He is in him
self / and of him self / most perfyghte. But because he is most hyghly and
perfyghtly good: he would not be blessed himself alone / but has distributed
of his beatitude and felicite unto angels / and men / and to all creatures: so
farforthe as every thing is apt to receive of the bountuosnes and liberalite
of god. How many ways god has spoken to man to give to him knowledge of him
self.
It was his will and pleasure to give man knowledge of himself: speaking to
him in diverse manners or facions. First of all he spoke after a certain manner
to mankind: when by his son / which is the word of the father / he did
create of naught this meruailouse frame of the world: to the entente / that of
the work we should guess and make con^eture of the worker. For such a work:
the first speaking by creation of the world.
could neither man / neither yet au^gel / have been able to perform and
finishe. This was the first degree or step to the knowledge of god. Next after
came the law: The second speaking by the law written^ and the prophets.
which did some what help the darkness and blindness of ma^^es mind / but it
besides that it was given to one nation only of the Jews; it did by figures
and dark ridles shadow god unto us preparyng the minds of men to the light
of the gospel: which by the son has shyned to us. The philosophers abused
the light of nature / to pride. And the law to the most part of the Jews:
was an occasion of greater impiety and sin. The world was full of ydolatry.
The Jews were puffed up with pride: thrughe a vain persuasion of ryghtuosnes.
Sy^ne did raygne at large vnponyshed in ye world / whils the most part of men
did follow the first pare^tes of mankind: but here the mercy of god did show
forth it self. Psalm. 14 4.
which passes and surmounteth all his works. He did vouchesafe to wax more
nere and more familierly known unto us / by the same son: The third
speaking by his own son in the nature of mankind.
that at the least wise by the reason hereof / we should be drawn to the
loving of him again / being provoked thereunto / by so many and so maruailouse
benefightes. He had created us / when we were nothing. He would also restore
us. When we were forlorn / for it had been better never to have been created:
tha^ after our cr^acion to have perished and ben utterly forlorn. After the
world meruailously created / after the law given by god / after the prophets
inspired with the spirit of god / he sent his only son being made m^n:
that at the least wise we men should love him being also a man. And he sent
him / not to be a revenger or ponysher / but to be a savior / by whose death
he might call us again to life / what could the unmeasurable charity and love of
god: have done more than this? He has showed himself palpable after a
certain manner: unto us / he has also given himself to death / as far forth
as he might to the end / that he might restore us to true health and salvation.
God showed his almighty power: in the creation of the world / and his wisdom
i^ the redemption of man.
He declared his almighty power cheffly: in the creation of the world. Now he
has declared his unmeasurable mercy / and his inscrutable wisdom / his mercy:
in that he freely / without any deseruynge of our part has redeemed us. His
wisdom / in that he has after such form and manner redeemed us. Therefore
what excuse is there now left / or what cauyllation can any man lay forth
for hymselffe: if he do not regard but do despise this so wonderful goodness
of god? This part does the Creed now teach Et in Iesum Christum filium eius
v^^cu^ dominum nostrum (id est) And in Jesus Christ his only son our lord.
DISC. Why has it sygnyfyed and marked forth / the person of our redemer / by
these names? MAG. Ueryly for thentente to declare / that the second person /
which took flesh upon him: is very man of his mother and very god of god.

DIS. How so? MAG. There are some / which do wene / that Jesus is the name of
the godhed / and Christ a name of the humane nature / and they seem to be
moved and brought to this opinion by the reason / that in the Hebrew tongue
Jesus is as much to say: as a sauyoure And Christus as much to say: as
anointed. Now no man can give everlasting health and salvation: save only
god. And anoyntynge does sygnyfie spiritual grace: which chances not but
only to man / but in very deed / both these words or names do belong to the
humayne nature. Jesus.
For Jesus is a propre name of a singular person / that is to wit of that
man / which alone of all me^ / was borne of a virgin / whom saint Johan
showed and poynted with his finger: that they should not receive or embrace any
other man / for the very redemer. Joan. i.
Behold (says he) the lamb of god. Christ.
Christus is a name either of kingdom / or of prestehode. For among the Jews
both prestes and kings were anointed with holy oyntemente / and they of both
sorts / because of honor: were called Christi.

Now both these tytles or names are agreynge to Christ / which is called
Psalm. c. ix.

Christ is both a priest and a king anointed / not with outward corporal
oil: but with the fullnes of the divine spirit.


a priest according to the order of Melchisedech / and which as a priest did
offer him self a very unspotted lamb / upon the aultare of the cross / for
the health and salvation of the world: and which also as a king / apperynge
to his disciples after his resurrection / said like a king unto them. To me
is given all power and auctorite in heaven and in earth. Mat. xxviii.
Neither did he refuse and disallow the speech of the theffe knowledgynge and
confessing him to be a king by these words. Luce. xxiii.
Lord remember me: when thou shalt be commen into thy kingdom. How be it our
lord was never anointed with outward and bodylye oil: so as Aaron was in
the.xxix. cha. of Exodus / or as king Saul was in the first book of kings
the.x. chapitoure^ But this was he / whom god has singularlye anointed with
the fulness of his spirit. Jesus.
How be it by this word or name of Jesus / besides that it does betoken a
singular person called to remembrance the figure of the old testamente.
Iosue figured Christ.
For that Jesus name did figure and represente ^esu the redemer. Deute. xxxi.
Moses / by whom is figured and betokened ceremonies: was not able to bring
the people of Israel into the land of promise or beheste. But Jesus the
captain that succeeded him: brought them into the said land. For there is
none entry or coming to true felycyte but by faith and grace / which Jesus
the son of a virgin has brought and offered to all men. In this word or
name Christus.
Christ / which in the gospelles and in the episteles of the Aposteles is often
times repeted and inculked: there is vpbrayded to the Jews their folyshe and
obstinate incredulyte and vnbeleffe / which yet until this day do look and
wait after their Messiah. Joan. x.
For him whom the latin men do call vnctum: anointed the greeks do call
Christu^ / the Hebrews do call Messiam. And they do wait after a king
plentuosly appointed with riches / with armies or hosts of men / and with
other worldly aids / which may restore the nation or people of the Jews
being now rejected and refused euerywhere / and outlawed / into lyberty and
kingdom. And with this vain hope: that wretched nation does comfort their
calamite that they are i^. But the christian faith does teach us / that this
is truly that only Messiah in the old time promised of the prophets: by
whom not only one nation / but through out the hole world as many as be true
Jews that is to say / as many as do profess the name of Christ / and be
cyrcuncysed in heart: should be / not by bodyly weapons but by his own blood /
delivered from the tyranny of the devil / and all their sins clean
forgeuen: should be restored unto true lyberty / and in conclusion by him
should be chosen and made coinherytoures and partetakers with him of the
heavenly kingdom. Jesus.
This word Jesus is therefore expressed: that there should be none error or
mistakynge in the person / and this name Christ is added and put to: lest any
man following the Jews: Christ.
should look for another Messiah or another redemer. He has comen ones for
all. He has ones for all performed and finished that singular and
wonderful sacryfice: with the mystical co^memoration and memorial of which
sacrifyce he would us to be nouryshed and strengthed: until he come again the
second time / not to be than a redemer / but a judge and a rewarder. First
therefore it has showed to us that very man so wonderful: which was
eternalle appointed for this purpose / that by him the world should be
redeemed. Anon after it shewethe to us in the same very god / in these words
filium eius vnicu^ dominum nostrum (that is to say) his only son our lord.
For of god / nothing is proprelye begotten but god / likewise as of man /
according to the course of nature / nothing is begotten but only man. DIS.
But the scripture does oftentimes call good and vertuose men / the sons of
god. MAG. And for that cause is added here this word vnicum or vnigenitu^
(that is to say) only or only begotten: to separat this son of god by
nature / from the sons / which are called to the honor of this name / by
the grace of adoption. DIS. Is it not lawful to call Christ as touching the
nature which he has taken upon him: the son of adoption? MAG. It is a more
religiouse and godly thing to abstain from such tytles lest we might give
some hold to the Arrianes. He is adopted: which was not son before /
likewise as we / which by nature are borne the children of wrath and
displeasure: by faith in Christ Jesus are made the sons of god. But Christ
was eternally the son of god / but after that he was conceived by the holy
ghost: his blessed soul was forth with created full of all heavenly grace.
But all though our Lord was twies borne / ones of his Father without time /
and before all time / and again of his mother a virgin in the time before
appointed of god: yet are there not two sons / but only one son / and not
another son: but the same otherwise borne. He was conceived of the substance
of the virgin: that we should acknowledge the veryte of the humane nature. But
he was conceived without man's work or help / by the holy ghost / and that
he was borne / his mothers virginite not violated or appayred / it was the
prerogatyue of dygnyte. DISE. why is here added Dominum nostru^ (that is to
say) our lord? MAGISTER: with this name Lord / the holy scriptures do
oftentimes honor him / and namely the scriptures of the new testamente. why
Christ is called our lord.
In that he was god of god: he was lord of all the world / and that not
another sundry lord from the father / likewise as he is not a sundry god from
the father. But after a certain specyal and peculiar manner he is called the
lord of the elect and chosen / whom he has won and delivered from the
dominion of Satan and has made them to him a people of acquisition. i. Petri.
ii.
For who so ever commits sin: he makethe himself servant or bondeman to
sin / and by sin Satan obtayneth tyranny. Joan. 8.
Therefore the symbol admonesheth and teaches us / that the dominion or
lordeshippe is translated from this most cruel tyraunte: unto Jesus Christ
far most gentle and merciful lord. And by this title the scriptures of the
new testament do oftentimes betoken and signify the son of god: shewenge to
whom they do dedycate them selves hole / which do receive baptism / and to
whose commandments they ought afterward to obey all their life time /
without any resistance or grudgynge / and under whose defense and protection
they may be sure and live quietly without any fear

Joan. x^
For noma^ is able to take from him any thing: that he possesses or has in
his keeping. DIS. The name of a lord / how is it agreynge to Christ: as
touching to his divine nature? or as touching to his humayne nature? or as
touching to both natures? MA. Forsooth as touching to both natures but not
after one manner. As touching to his divine nature: he was lord of all things
/ from the beginning of the world / but as touching to the humayne nature:
which he took unto him: he deserved by death / and rebuke or dyshonoure: to
enter into glory. Philipens. ii.
And a name was given to him: which is above all names: that in the name of
Jesus every knee should bow it self: both of heavenly things / of earthely
things / and of things under earth. DIS. Is he than: as he is man: the lord
of Aungelles? MAG. ye verily: and of deuyls also. DIS. To whether substantive
is this nowne adjective vnicum (id est) only: referred? to the word filium
son that goes before? or else to the word dominum lord that folowethe? MAG.
This adjective is sete doutfully between both those substa^tiues: because it
may agree with both. For as he is the only son by nature: so is he the only
lord of all things created. How be it yet / it is better to refer this
adjective to the word Filium / id est son: because this distinction ^othe
evidently express his divine nature / whi^he nature / in that he is begotten
of the father / he has commune with the father. D Why is it not than said.
In vnico filio eius / id est in his only son? For so there should have been
none ambiguite or doubt at all. M. It was most conueniente / that the word /
which is added because of difference: should be put after. For if he should
have said. Unicum filium eius: it might have been so taken and under standed /
that the name of the son of god / did agree or belong to none / save only to
that one man Jesus / but now / when he adds this word / Unicum afterward:
he does not divide the name filium / but he shows a distinct and sundry
manner of generation / that we should understand the second person / which of
god his father is borne very god without time: the self same in time
conueniente of god appointed / to have been borne of a virgin / very man of
woman. Sayn^te Augustine in his little book made of ye Creed / for one word
puts twain / saying. Et in Iesum Christum filium eius vnigenitum vnicum
dominu^ nostrum / id est. And in Jesus Christ his only begotten son our only
lord. But for as much as it is not euidente by his declaration / whether
himself did so read or not: it is probable and lykely / that the word
vnigenitum / id est only begotten was added by some man: which went about to
declare / why he had said vnicum / id est only. For the son of god is other
whiles in the scriptures called primogenitus.i. the first begotten son / as
touching his nature humayne: and vnigenitus / as touching to his divine
natiuite / as for exaumple in the.viii. chapter to the Romans.

Ut sit ipse primogenitus in multis fratribus / id est. That he should be the
first begotten son among many brotherne. And in the first chapter of
Johan. Uidimus gloriam eius gloriam quasi vnigeniti a patre id est. We have
seen the glory of it / as the glory of the only begotten son of the father.
Also in the third chapitoure. Siedeus dilexit mundu^: vt filium suum
vnigenitum daret (that is to say) God did so love the world: that he would
give his only begotten son. As touching to his former generation: neither
is he our brother: neither is he ye heir of god: neither has he brotherne /
nor coinherytoures. As touching his latter more generation: he has both
brethren and coinheritoures. DIS. Is there no dyfference between vnicum / and
vnigenitum (id est) only and only begotten? MAG. He may be called vnicus (id
est) the only son: which alone is remaining and left alive of many
children / but a man should not call him aryght vnigenitum (id est) only
begotten son / how be it the interpretoures of the holy scripture do
translate this one greek word monogenis: other whiles vnicum only: other
whiles vnigenitum only begotten. As in the.vii. chapitoure of Luke: he is
called vidue filius vnicus (that is to say) the only son of the widow:
whom the Euangeliste called Monogeni. And prototokos (that is to say)
primogenitus the first begotten son: is other whiles called vnigenitus id est
ye only begotten son / for thus speaks Mathewe of the mother of Jesus. Math. i.
Luce. ii.

How it is to be vnders^onden / that Christ is the first begotten son of Mary


Peperit filium suum primogenitum.i. She brought for the her first begotten
son. For other whiles that thing is called first / not that goes before other
things: but which was never before / as for exaumple when we do say. This
day is the first time / that ever I saw the emperor / it is well said and
aryghte: all though I never se him again here after. So likewise he may be
called primogenitus.i. the first be gotten son: which is the first / that
ever his mother brought forth: although she never do bring forth any mo
again after him. For else those things / which the law does command to be
done / in / or about the first be gotten / should not have been to be
performed and fulfilled / except there had followed two child beari^ges / for
he is not called primus.i. first: but which is the formoste at the least / of
three. D. But if Christ / even as touching to his humane nature also / is the
lord of all things: how is it tha^ / that he is said to have brotherne? M.
Albeit that Christ were not the lord of al things / as touching to his humane
nature / yet that not withstanding he should be called aryghte the lord of
all things / because of the unite of his hypostase or personage / contenynge
or comprehendynge in it self three substaunces: even likewise / as it is well
said: that god has suffered and has died for us. But here this word brother
is not a name betokenyng equalite: but betokenynge lykenes / kyndred / and
charity. After ^he same manner he vouchesa^fed of his goodness to call his
disciples / not servants: Johan. xv.
but friends / not that he did renounce or forsake his right and auctorite /
which in another place he acknowledges and takes to himself / when he
says. Johan. xiii.
You do call me master and lord / and you say well / for in deed so am I:
but for thentente to declare his excellent charity and love / which refuses
nothing: so that it may do profighte. And what nouelty or marvel is it / if
he did vouchesafe to call them brotherne: toward whom he did not disdain to
play the minister? Johan. xiii.
The Jews did call all those that were of their own nation / brotherne: but
specially their cosens or kynsmen / now was our lord a Jew borne of the
Jews / which thing the Evangelists Mathue and Luke have evidently expressed
in the genealogy of him. Math. i. Luc. iii.
But in very deed / all men are brotherne each one to other: by the reason /
that they at all of one and the same nature / which nature came forth of one
and the same progenitoures: and in every man is subdued and in danger to like
affections and miseries / save only in Christ I do except sin / and what so
ever is inclynyng to sin. D. Original sin is not proprely any sin. M. No
but yet it lets or hinders the fulness of grace: Johan. i.
which was in Christ as saynete Johan witnesses / but it inclines a man to
sin: though it does not move and drive a man perfightly to it. This thing is
repugnaunte to the dignite of Christ. For it was not conueniente / that he /
which was com to purge and cleanse the world from al sins: should be any
manner way agreyng or in clynyng to sin. D. But to be hu^grie / to be thrusty
/ to be weary / to be a^guished / to loathe / to dye / all these are buddes of
original sin: and yet they are given to Christ in the scriptures. MA. There
is great difference betwe^ the nature of man as it was first created: and the
same nature as it is after the fall of Adam. Adam before that he did sin / was
a very man / and yet for all that was he free from these inco^modities and
miseries / wherewith we all are now oppressed: Peccatum is taken in diverse
significations / in the scripture.
some of us more / and some of us less / peccatum (id est) sin / in the
scripture is otherwhyles called the pain / that is due to sins / and
otherwhiles it is taken for the sacrifice / wherewith they do cleanse their
sin and offense. And therefore it was said to the prestes of the old law.
Peccata populi co^medetis (id est) you shall eat the sins of the people /
meaning the sacrifices: which the people should offer for their sins / and
saint Paul in the second epistle and the v. chapitoure to the Cori^thianes
says Eum qui non nouerat peccatu^: pro nobis peccatu^ fecit. ii. Cort. v.
Him that knew no sin at al: has he made to be sin for us. Our lord
received and took on himself not only the veryte of man's nature: but also
the inco^modities and miseries which don accompanye the nature of man fallen /
those things only excepted: which either are not convenient or agreynge to
the dignite of that person / which was both god and man: orels which do
exclude (as I said before) the fulness of grace. For neither did he receive
proclyuyte or redynes to do sin: no neither yet so much as power to sin:
neither did he receive or take unto him error or ignorance. And those
inco^modytes / which he did receive and take upon him: he took them on him /
not of the necessite of nature: but voluntarely for our sake / to make
satisfaction for our offenses / and to suffer for that which we had
trespased. DIS. Why did he change the preposition here saying de spiritu
sancto / er Maria virgin? MAG. The Greeks have but one and the same
preposition ex in both places: but the signification of this preposition is
diverse. All things are ex ipso et per ipsum (id est) of him / and by him: as
of their authoure and begynner. A piece or goblete is made ex auro (id est) of
gold: as of the matter or stuff / ex arbore nascitur arbor (id est) of one
tree comes another tree: by propagation of kind. So ex homine gignitur homo
(id est) of a man is gendred a man. DIS. Why does it here express the holy
ghost only: seeing that the hole trinite did work together / this wondrefull
mystery? M. Because in the gospel of Luke / the angel said to the virgin.
Luce. i.
Spiritus sanctus superueniet in the (id est) The holy ghost shall come upon
the. For oftentimes the scripture does attribute and give to each one of the
persons / certain things as propre to it: The scriptur does attribut to each
one of the.iii. persons in the godhed certain things as peculiare or propre /
which for all that / are common all three.
which for all that are common to all three / as for exaumple: when it geuethe
to the father: eternite and almightines / to the son: wisdom: to the holy
ghost: charity and goodness / and when the father is said to have made the
world by his son and to distribute and give his gifts by the holy ghost. The
symbol therefore / and Gabriel in this mystery / has expssed the workynge of
the.iii. persons.

Luce. i.
The holy ghost (says he) shall come upon the / and the power of the hygheste
shall ouershadowe the / when thou hear speak of the highest: thou
vndestondest and perceyuest the father to be present / as the fountain and
authoure / as of whom the sone is sent with the holy ghost / when thou hearst
these words virtus altissimi / the virtue or power of ye highest: thou
vndersto^dest ye sone / which only took upon him man's na nature. For nether
the father / neither the holy ghost did take our nature and become man. For
the holy ghost is conveniently said to come upon / or as it is in the latyne
superuenire / that all the worldly cogitation of man should be excluded: which
wha^ it hereth the word or name of co^ception or birthe: does i^magine the
sede of man received in the womb of a woman / or wha^ it is told and warned /
that a man was borne of a virgin: does dream and imagyne also some fowler
thing than these / consyderyng and reckenynge what things are spread abroad by
men's tales of certain woman which are reported and said to have conceived
child by sede of man that has been swymmynge in the bathe / and of Mares
conceyuynge by of the wind and of fendes or wicked spretes that have gotten
women with child. I pass over here the feigned tales of poets / by which the
gentiles or hethen peoples were persuaded and brought in beleffe / that of
gods and women / and of goddesses and men / were ge^dred and broughtforth
heroes The evangelist therefore to exclud al these porte^tuose imaginatio^s /
does profess / yt there was here instead of a husbonde / the heavenly father:
which after a certain manner does begette his son again / he professes
that the beginning of this child was not of a deuylle or wicked sprite / that
had meddled or had to do with the mother: neither of any illusion of wicked
sprite: but of the holy ghost. And that it is even thus and none otherwise:
Luce. i.
the very tenoure and process of the Euangelystes words does declare openly /
wha^ unto the virgin being dismayed and indowt at the mention made of
conceyuynge and bearing child / and demanding how and after what manner this
thing should be done: the angel easynge her mind of this scrupule or dowte
/ made answer in this wise. The holy ghost shall come upon the. DIS. why
does the symbol or Creed express the virgins name? MAG. For the more faith
and credence of the history. So likewise and for the same consideration did it
express the name of Jesus Christ / so did it express the name and syrname of
the deputy and ruler under the^peroure: Ponce Pilate. And for the same purpose
did Luke here diligently express all the names / of the month / of god / that
sent the angel / of the angel: that was sent of embassage / of the region
/ of the cite / of the husband / of the tribe or kyndred: and of the virgin:
when he said these words. Luce. i.
And in the sixte month / the angel Gabriell was sent from god / unto a
city of Galile / which was named Nasareth / to a virgin being spoused to a
man / whose name was Joseph / of the house of David. And the virgins name was
Marie. Those men do not make narration after this form and manner: which do
feign lies / and are afraid to be espied and perceived. Esaie inspired with
the holy ghost / in old time prophesied in this wise. Esaie.vii.
Behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son / and his name shall be
called Emanuel / which by interpretation is as much to say / as god with us.
Math. i.
That virgin / the Euangeliste inspired with the same ghost: does here show
unto us as it were with a finger. And the au^gel as it were expoundynge and
declaryng the prophecy of Esaie: Luce. i.
said. And that holy thing which shall be borne of the shall be called ye son
of god. This is that Mary / at whose name / al ye soulles of good men are
recreated / chered^and comforted / wha^ we do here Eve named: we do ware
inwardly sorrowful / and do mourn: when we do here the name of Marie / we do
pluck up our hearts / and are lift up into good hope. By Eve / we are borne
the children of wrath and displeasure: by Marie we are borne again the children
of grace and favor: DI. Scholde he be accounted and taken for an heretic:
which would believe / that Marie the virgin after the birth of Christ had
brought forth other children by her husband? Of the perpetual virginite of our
blessed lady.
MAG. ye verily not only for an heretic: but for a blasphemouse person also.
DIS. And yet they say / that this thing is not expressed in the holy
scripture. MAG. That is very troth / but though it be not expressed: yet is
it euydently gathered and concluded of holy scripture / and that it should be
otherwise: is manifestly repugnaunte to the dygnyte both of the son / and of
the mother. Finally the catholyke church has with so great consen^e believed /
taught / and fastly affyrmed it / from the beginning of the gospel / even
until this day: that it ought no whitte less to be believed / than if it were
expressed in ye holy scriptures. D. I long to here the scriptures. M. The
prophet Ezechiel did signify the perpetual integrite of the virgin by a
darcke prophecy. Ezech. xliii^.
Wwhan he being turned toward the way of the gate of the vttermore
sanctuary / which gate looked toward the East / herd the same spirit / which
did consecrat the chastity of Mary / saying these words unto him This gate
shall be shitte / and shall not be opened / and no man shall pass through it for
the lord god of Israel ha^h entered in by it and it shall be shitte to the
prince. Did not the prophet in these words very proprerly and aptely enough
descrybe and painteforth the sacred womb of the virgin: out of which womb /
that sone of rightuosnes has risen to us which does lighte^ every man that
comes into this word? Johan. i.
of which son zachary also says in the gospel of Luke / Luce. i.
he has visited us / spryngynge or risynge from an high to give light unto
them which sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. This gate was shitte
before the time of her deliuerau^ce of child / it was shitte in the time of
deliuerau^ce / and it co^tynued also stille shitte after the time of her
delyuera^ce / it was open only to the prince Christ: which by his entering
in / did sanctify it / and by his going out did consecrate it / for it did
not look but only toward the east / fro^whence the most pure son does
vprise / that son (I mean) which never sets or goes down / and which
renews and chereth all things. It looked to the way of the outward sanctuare:
for this natiuite was without the common manner of natiuites of men: having no
whit of humane concupiscence or lust mengled or joined unto it. Finally when
she herself speaks thus to the angel quia viru^ no^ cognosco.i. for I know
no man: Luce. i.
she shows plainly her perpetual purpose of virginite. DIS. But seeing that
wedlock is an honorable thing of it self / and that company of man and wife
together is without blame or syn: what indignite or unworthiness should it have been / if the lord had been borne after such manner / as other prophets were
borne / and as Johan Baptist was borne / which was more excellent than al
prophets? why Christ would not be begotten between man and woman / as other
holy prophets were,
MAG. In deed wedlock is an honorable thing / if it be chastely kept / but
perpetual virginite is a far more honorable thing / if it be so / that it
be wylfully taken / and for the love of godlynes and virtue / through
concupiscence without which man is not conceived. The contagion and infection
of original sin goes from one to another. But more than au^gelicall purite
did be seem this heavenly chyldebyrthe. I pray the tell me now / if any man did
turn a temple made of stone / after it had been ones hallowed and sacred to
god by a mortal bishop / i^to a showemakers shope would not all men cry out /
that it were shamefully and vnaccordyngly don? DIS. yes verily / and they would
also ouerwhelme him with stones. MAG. And yet is not the showemakers craft any
filthy occupation. And if any man would put a vessel / that had been
consecrated and dedycated to baptism: or holy oil / or to other holy uses /
unto profane uses of the kechen: should it not seem an intolerable contumely
and despite? DIS. yes dowtles. MA. And yet is there no faughte or sin in the
cokes craft. D. It is troth. M. what is tha^ to be said of the most sacred
and holy temple of ye blessed virgins body? wh^che not every manner bishop has
dedicated with bodily oil: but the holy ghost himself has consecrated it with
heavenly that divine child rested so many months / as in a brydechaumbre: in
which also / as in a workehowse / the hole trinite did work and finishe that
mystery / which is to be honored and worshipped even of the aungelycall
minds? Should it not seem a very vnme^e and unseemly thing: if it had been
open / I will not say to man: but even to an angel? D. yes I perceive it very
plainly. M. Now reken and consider this with thy self / whether we should rather
give crede^ce to the church / so co^sent^g and agreing together: orels to the
Jews being not only in this point mad / orels to vile and unlearned
Heluidius / whose error taken of the scriptures mysunderstonded / is so
manifest: Heluidius
that scasely he has fownde any disciples of his error / and also of the
old doctoures of the church has been scasely judged worthy of confutation?
DIS. I see and perceive / how greatly perpetual virginite did beseme that
birth. But why would the lord be borne of a married woman? why Christ would b^
borne of a virgin being married to an husband.
MA. It was provided by that mean / for the ionge virgin / that she should
have a keeper / an inte^der / a nourysher / and a minister: without any sinister
suspytion of the wicked and mysdemynge co^mun people / and also that she should
have her spouse and husband a weighty and substancyall witness of her
virginite / it was semely and convenient / that such a virgin as she was:
should be in most high and perfyghte tranquillyte and quyetnes / and it was
convenient and mete / that the mother of god should be not only pure from all
sin: but it was also according that she should be not so much as touched
onywhitte with the false tales of men. For she only is excellently chaste: of
whom the fame is aschamed to speak evil. And therefore this mystery was hid
and kept secret a long season. For it is lykely / that Marie and Iosephe did
keep these mysteries in their heart: until such time yt after the sendyng of
ye holy ghost from heaven / the gospel did spr^ade abroad his light through out
the hole world. Considre therefore now how many things we have learned by this
article co^prehe^ded in few words first that Jesus Christ is very god of god
/ and the same to have been borne very man of a woman a virgin / without ye
help or workynge of man. But by the work of the divine spirit. And that he
has come in to this world not only to redeem the world: The causes of
Christ's coming into the world.
but also to teach and instruct us with most full auctorite / and to kendle
and inflame us with diverse arguments / unto the love of the heavenly life. Now
considre me / I pray the how many horrible heresies and erroures the light
of this verite has driven away / yt is very sore against my will to reherce
the detestable and abominable blasphemes / with the unhappy names of the
authoures of them: but yet this thing shall profyghte and healpe well hereunto
that we may both more fastly hold and keep our bele^^e: and also give thanks
the more abundantly to god / which has vouchesaued to open and show so
greatte light unto us. That many did err and hold wrong opinions about his
divine natiuite of his father: it is less to be meruayled. Carpocrates
C^rinthus Ebion Paulus Samosatensis Photinus.
But it is a point of more madness / that his humane natiuite which has been
proved and declared by so many and so evident arguments / has been assailed
with so many monstres of opinions / Carpocrates / Cerintyus^ Ebion / Paulus
Samosatensis / and Photine in name but Scotine in very deed / do grant / that
Christ was a very man. But they say / that he was a pure and a mere man /
borne between man and woman / after the manner of other men^ albeit he had the
soul of a prophet. These men do mutilate and mayme the person of Christ of
more than the one halffe. The same men do say that Christ is called the son
of god / but by free adoption: likewise as other good vertuose men are. And
that he was not at all: before that he was borne of the virgin. These heretics
/ sayncte Johan eua^geliste does openly refelle and confute / pronouncyng
plainly / Johan. i.
That the self same word / which in the beginning was with god and was god:
to be made flesh. And in the same euangeliste our lord himself speaks
openly in this wise Before yt Abraham was made: Johan. viii.
I am. Again Paul in the.ix. chapter to the Romans says. Roma.ix.
Of whom Christ came as touching his body: which is god over all things /
blessed for ever more. Neither are the Manicheis any whitte less mad / than
these before reherced / which do give unto Christ some part of the divine
nature: Manicheis^
but they do styfly affirm / that he took upon him man's body / not a very
body in deed: but only a fantastical body / likewise as we do read / that
angels and fendes have otherwhiles apered i^ bodily shape and likeness unto
men. These persons do make Christ a iuglere or a trogeter and a wonderful
deceiuer of men. But a phantasme is not borne of a woman. Neither can a
phantasme or spirit do those things: which our lord did so many years space
throughout all his life time / eating / drynkyng / slepynge / waxyng weary /
hungrieng / thurstynge / speaking / being conuersaunte among men at none days
/ geuynge himself to be touched and handled / to be crucified / and slain. He
himself also said to his disciples in the last chapter of Luke wha^ they
were astonished and abashed / because they thought that they had seen a spirit
or a ghost. Luc. xxiiii.
Wherefore are you troubled (says he) and why do thoughts and musynges
ascend into your hertes? Behold my hands and my fete: for it is even mine
own self. Handle me / and se / for a spirit has neither flesh / ne bones
/ so as you do se that I have. Ualentine.
Next after these comes Ualentine the framer and forger of worlds / which
imagined / Christ not to have been gendred of the substance of the virgin:
but to have brought with him a celestial body from heaven / or else (which
thing mad Appelles does wene raither to be true) a body taken of the
elements / in the air: Appelles.
and so to have passed through the body of the virgin / likewise as liquoure
and light passethe through a pype of led / or through a cranel or hole. But
this is not proprely to be borne: but to pass through / for neither does the
cranel or ho^e gendre or bring forth the son be alme: but the son itself
/ neither does the pype gendre the liquoure: but the fountain or spring
does it. But when Paul the apostle says unto the Romans these words. To.
i.
Qui factus est ex semine David secundum carnem.i. Which as touching flesh
was made of the sede of David / and in the.iiii. chapter to the Galatianes
Misit deus filium suum factum ex muliere.i. Gala. iiii.
God sent his son made or gendred of a woman. By these words he does openly
profess / that Christ did take the substance of his body / of ye substance
of ye virgins body. Neither every thing / which any manner way is bredde or
gendred of man: is forthwith a man (for else lyse should be called men) But that
thing / which is conceived in the matrice or womb of a woman / of the very
substance of man: and in due and lawfulle time is borne and brought forth by
natural members in all marks and tokens like a man / and which is called a
son / that thing verily is a man. Arrius.
Next comes Arrius by so much the more wretched and mad in opinion / by
how much he does more subtely and craftily give unto Christ the body of a
man / and takes from him the soul of man / saying that the godhed was instead of soul / so that in Christ after his opinion there were but two
natures / that is to wit the body of man / and verbum (id est) the word /
which same word for all that / Arrius wills to be a creature / in deed more
excellent than all other creatures: but yet a creature. But with what face do
they confess and grant him to be a man: from whom they do take away the
better part of man? For who does not know that man is made of.ii. separable
substa^ces / that is to wit of the body as of the material substance / and
of the soul as of the form? wherefore if any spirit does move the body of a
dead man: no man will call it a man / that he sees: but a wondre or monstre.
But seeing yt our lord himself in so many places of scripture does make
mention of his ^oule and does call himself the son of man as when he says.
Mat. xxvi.
My soul is heavy even unto the death. And wha^ he says / Father into thy
hands I do commend my soul. And / Luce. xxiii. Johan. x. Johan. viii.
Noman does take my soul or life from me: but I do lay it from me / you do
seche to slay me being a man which have spoken the truth unto you. And
seeing that Paul witnesses the same saying. i. Timot. ii.
The mediatoure between god and men the man Christ Jesus: if they do give
crede^ce to the scriptures: how or with what face dare they deny that thing /
which the scriptures done so manyfestly express and pronunce? if they do not
believe the scriptures: how may they for shame desire to be accounted and taken
for Christian men? if they would seem to be philosophers: who ever ones dreamed
that / yt thing might be called a man which lacks the form of man which
form (I mean the soul) wha^ it is present / causes one to be a man / and
wha^ it goes away caused that thing / which was before a man / than to lose
the name of a man. Those men / which have so wondrefull mad opinions: they
stand in danger them selves (and not unworthily) lest they may seem not to
be men. Neither was the opinion / which Apollinarius dremed much wiser than
these aforereherced / which does suffer a soul to be given to Christ:
Apollinarius.
but so / that he does take from ye said soul / the mind or under standing /
for in quick plants there is a certain life: for else they should not grow /
neither should they else be said to dye: when they do widder or dry up. And in
brute beasts also there is a life and soul: for else they should have no
fealynge or perceyuyng. But mind or reason and understanding / among al
sensyble creatures / is only to man. This mind is the princypall power of the
soul / by which it does dyscerne and judge every thing from other / by
which it does join or knytte together / or else divide and depart things in
sondre: and by which it gathers or concludes one thing of another / by
argume^tation and reasonynge. But how may they for shame profess Christ to
be a man: which do take away from him that thing / by which man does
cheflye and principallye dyffre from other beasts? DIS. Did than the mind of
Christ / by reasonynge / of things known gather and conclude / such things
/ as were unknown to him? MA. There was nothing unknown to Christ / and yet
as concerning the condition and state of nature: he had a reasonable soul.
For not aungelles neither / do understand by reasonynge / so as we do / nether
shall we our selffes understand in the general resurrection so as we do now.
But perfection added to nature / does not take away the veryte of nature (For
else the bodies gloryfyed should be no bodies) And yet is it none heresye or
error to say / that the soul of Christ began to know certain things /
which by the presence of the godhede it did before perfyghtelye ^ee and
perceive. I say begane to know the same things otherwise / after the manner
of men / not for that he knew them not before. But because the manner of his
knowing now / was sundry and diverse from the manner of his knowing before.
Johan. i.
He had seen Nathanael / when he was under the Fig tree / because he did
know it more certainly / than we do those things / which we do see with our
iyes. But afterward when he saw him with his bodyly eyes / in deed he did not
learn any new thing / which he knew not before but he saw otherwise / the
same thing that he had seen before. Appollinarius.
Apollinarius adds another mad opinion / that the word did not take unto
it flesh or body but that somewhat of the word was turned into flesh /
mysunderstondynge the words of sayncte Johan.

Johan. i.
Et verbum caro factu^ est (id est) and the word was made flesh / that is to
say after his false interpretation / the word was changed into flesh:
likewise as the air condensated and made thycke or gross / is turned into
water / and as the water raryfied / and made fine and subtyle / is turned into
air. But a man is not made of a countrefayte word turned into an humayne
body: but man is made of a reasonable soul and a mortal body. if by the
word they do understand the son of god: god as he is made of nothing: so
can he not be turned into any thing / nor any thing into it / if we will
speak proprely. And if philosophers do deny / that fiere may be turned into
water which are both creatures: how much more against all reason is it / a
thing increated to be turned into a thing created? But you will say they
make the word a creature: but a more excellent creature than all aungelles.
But yet even betwe^ an angel and the body of man there is more dyfference:
than is between fyar and water. But this error conceived folyshely of the
eua^gelystes words: the words immediately following do refelle and confute.
Johan. i.
Et habitauit in nobis (that is to say) and he has dwelled among us. For
that thing is not said to be conuersaunte in body / which is transformed
into body. But the body is well and aryghte called the dwelling place of the
soul. And man is well and aryghte called the temple of god. Eutyches in greek
is as much to say as happy / which is no right name: for that unhappy and
wretched heretic
And nowhitte wiser is the erroneouse opinion of falsenamed Eutyches / which
did put in Christ to be but only one nature / compost and made of divine
and humane nature hothe to gether. if he had said / that one syngulare
person had been vned of two natures / and that even one person indiuiduale
(as the term of logicions is) some what he had been to be herd and believed /
for it is certain and undoubted / that there was in Christ / two or also three
sondrye natures and distinct each of them from other. Man is composte and made
of a soul and a body. But the divine nature / because it is most syngle: it
refuses all names or words of composition. It vned or did knytte it self
into one hypostase or person / by the means of the soul / being joined: and
cleuynge to the body / but it was not confused or mengled into the same
nature. Nestorius whiles he does dylygently eschew Nestorius.
this lymekylle: he fell into the colekylne / professynge in Christ to be two
perfighte natures / the nature of god / and the nature of man: Proverb.
but he makes than as many persons / denyenge the word to have been vned and
knytte to man into one person: but only to have inhabited man by grace /
wherefore he gathers and concludes / that in one Christ there is one person
of man / and another person of god / and yt Marie is not well called the mother
of god / but only the mother of man: all be it that the anngell in Lukes
Gospel does say to the virgin. Luce. i.


For that holy thing / which shall be borne of the: shall be called the
son of god. For the unite of the personage / causes / yt by a certain
idiomatu^.i. communione of proprietes of speaking / even those things /
which do not agree but only unto the humane natu: re: may also be said
aryghte of god: but only in the voices concrete.

God was borne of a virgin / but not the godhed. God suffered / but not the
godhede / and Man is god / but not the Nature of man is the godhed.

But because there is none end of errouxes: I will make an end of this
rehersall / and I fear / lest I have allredye made the werye with rehercynge
so many erroures. DISCIPLE. Uerylye I have pity on these heritikes How be
it yet there madness has done me good: by reason of whom it is caused / that
both I do more clearly perceive and see the truth / and also do more fastly
believe it. MAG. The heretics are worthy no thank herefore but god is very
greatly to be thanked / whose goodness has turned the malice and wickedness of
other men / unto his servants / in to the lucre and encreace of godliness.
DIS. Why is not than the symbol or Creed made in the synod holden at
Constantinople / contented to say natus ex Maria virgin (id est) borne of the
virgin Marie / but adds et homo factus est (that is to say) and was made
man? MAGI. For they which would dispute any thing subtyly of Christ /
allthough they be holden with diverse and sundry erroures: yet in this one
thing they do al agree / that they do deny him to be man / in as much as they
do take from him some thing / which if we have not: none of us should be
called truly a very man. Therefore is this expressed. Et homo factus est (that
is to say) And he was made man: that no man should come to baptism being
infected with the poison of them. For else what man is so far without common
iudgeme^te and reason / that when he hereth say / that the two Gracches were
borne of Cornelia: will ask the question / whether the two Gracches were men?
DIS. Whereof come it than / that these men were so meruaylously blind? MAG.
Ueryly because they had lever make search and dispute of the divine matters /
than symplely to believe the^. The scripture says: that we shall have none
understanding or perceiving / except we will believe. But they would perceive
and understand by the proud philosophy of the world / before that they would
believe. Let here therefore be the end of this communication / that after thou
haste recorded these things with thy self in thy mind and haste given
thanks to the divine spirit: thou may return the more cherefull and lusty
/ to learn the residue that is behind.

The fourth in struction.
DISCIPLE. IT follows. He suffered under Ponce pilate: was crucified dead and
buried. M. Those men / that give unto Christ an imaginarye and fantastical
body: the same men do say / that all such things as it is red that Christ
did suffer in his humane nature / he did not suffer them in very deed: but only
phantastically and apparently. But we / which taught by god do believe / that
he was a very man: do also believe / that he did suffer verily and matter in deed
/ both in mind and in body / and that he was verily crucified / dead / and
buried. The death of a natural man is the separation of the soul from the
body / which separation when it is ones made: all we do know / what manner a
thing the dead body is than: but the soul / be cause it is i^mortal / though
the body be decayed and fallen away: yet has it still being / living with
Christ (if it departed from the body with faith) and lokynge after the
resurrection and risynge again of her own body. D. What difference is there
betewne an angel / and a soul that is separated from the body? The
differe^c^ between an angel, and a soul separated from the body.
M. Uerily this / that a soul is in deed a mind: likewise as angels are /
but so created of naught / when it is put into the body: that it is naturally
apt to give life / to govern / and to move not every manner body: but that
body only / to which it is spicially appointed and ordained by god. This
di^fere^ce is there between the death of Christ / and the death of one of
us: The difference between Christ's death and ours.
that our soul by the violence of sickness and disease / orels through
defaulte and want of humors / is driven out from our body. But our lord
willyngly laid from him his soul and life / even likewise as he did wylfully
com to the cross and passion. A token hereof and an euidente argument is /
Math. xxvii.
that he gave up the ghost upon the cross immediately after a great and a
strong cry. Ye moreover his own self also says in the gospel of Johan.
Johan. x.
Noman takes away my life from me: but I do lay it from mine own self. D.
But where was in the mean season the word or the second person of the
godhed: which thou saydest to be so vned and knytte to man: that both together
made one person? was it in the soul departed from the body? orels was it in
the dead body? M. Saint Augustine deuotely did believe and suppose / that the
godhed was neither separat from ye body neither from ye soul / but was psente
with the^ both But it is bett not to enter into the co^bre some mase of such
manner questions: out of which it is hard to find any way to get out. Now
we do teach only rudimentes and princyples: and not the most high points:
we do cast a fundation or ground of our warke: we do not finishe and make it
full perfighte / for we do instruct a nouyce newely converted / and not a
divine: and to make an end / we do inform a ionge soldier to faith and
beleffe: not an old worn chau^pion to battle and fight. DISC. Why do we
add these words passus est (that is to say) He suffered: seeing that the said
words are not ^^ded of them in the old time? Does he not suffer who so ever
is crucified? MAG. It appears / that this particle also was added against
certain men / which did imagine / that the word did as it were swalowe up
the body / that it took unto it self: and transfourming it after a certain
manner into it self: did make it such a manner body that it could not feel any
pain or greffe. They say / that Galanus was the authoure of this opinion.
Galanus.
But the scripture on every side speaks openly against this. First Esaie
the prophet says. Esaie.liii^
He has verily taken upon him our sycknesses / and our sorrows and greffes he
has borne. And lest any man might find a cauillation and say / that the
prophecy is dark / and that it might be / that some other person is meante in
the said prophecy than Christ: Actuu^. viii.
Sayncte Luke in the.viii. chapter of the acts tells / how Philippe / which
being warned of the holy ghost had joined himself to the chariote of the
gelded man: did by the information of the same spirit / expound and declare
this whole place / to him / of the passion of Christ. And holy and godly men
do apply that unto the passion of Christ: which is red in the lamentacions of
Iheremie. Threnorum. i.
O all you that do pass by / in the way: take heed and se whether there be
sorrow or pain / like unto my sorrow and pain. And in the gospel of Luke /
Luc. xxiiii.
our lord says / Ought not Christ to have suffered these things: and so
to enter into his glory? Also in the first epistle of Peter / and the second
chapter: it is written thus. Which when he suffered: did not manace or
thretten. Again in the same place. Christ has suffered for us: leauyng you an
ensample / that you should follow his steps. But how shall we follow him in
suffryng pains and greffes: if he himself suffered or felt no pain or grefe
at all? And sai^cte Paul in the.viii. chapter to the Romans says. If it so
be that we do suffer together with him: that we may be glorified also with
him. Sayncte Paul calls here suffrynge together with him / not to have
compassion and to be sorry for another man's euilles / or hurtes / and greffes:
but according to the example of him / to suffer and abide patiently the
persecucion of evil and wicked men. And that Christ suffered in soul also:
even his own self does witness saying. Math. xxvi.
My soul is heavy even unto the death. Add hereunto / that our lord even al
his life long did suffer many things for our sakes: being hungry / being
thursty / waxyng weary and faynte / being reviled / and despigh^uosly handled /
driue^out / taken / bou^de^ / bespetted / and buffeted. To these things / and
to other like: may this word passus est (id est) he suffered / belong and be
referred. D. Why does the symbol or Creed so diligently express the kind
and manner of his death? M. For the same consideration and skyl / for which it
did express the name and the forename of Pylate / that is to wit for the
more evidence of the history. D. Why would god redeem the world with the death
of his own son: and that with such manner death? M. But do thou first make
me answer to one thing. If any physician being excellently skylled in his
faculty / did take unto his cure a man / that were sick of a perilouse and
deadly disease: and one / that were nothing skylled in the craft at all /
would ask him the question why do thou cure this man after this manner?
Should he not seem lewd / and very worthily? How much more lewd thing is
it than to require an account or a cause of god: wherefore he would redeem the
world after this manner? This thing thou must surely and steadfastly believe /
that nothing pleases god but that / that is best / whether it seem so to us /
or not seem so. DI. The fundation and groundewarke of my faith standethe fast
and unshaken: but yet I suppose it is lawful / religiously and with reverence
to enquiere of these things. MAG. ye verily / and lawful for us also to make
answer / but with ye same religion and reverence. But these things do
require a peculyare and propre tr^atise: how be it yet I will touch a few
things / as it were by the way. Death came into the world by an earthely
man: it was conueniente / that the same should be taken away by an heavenly
man. By unlawful pleasure / crope in the death and destruction of mankind: by
pains and doloures / health and salvation was repaired. By a virgin disceyued
with the inspyration of the serpe^te / came calamite and misery: by a virgin
made great with child by the inspiration of the holy ghost / came again
wealth and felicite. And that god being offended and dysplesed / is reconciled
and pacified by the blood and slaughter of brute beasts / not only the law
of Moses did persuad it / but also Abel eue^ forth with in the very begi^nyng
of the world did offer of the first bego^te^ of his sheep In so much that the
very paynymes also / which never had knowledge of the very living god / yet were
persuaded and did believe surely / that me^nes offenses were cleansed and washed
away with death and blood. In certain cou^tryes / and among certain
people it was a common manner and custom / all the year long dylygently to
keep and nouryshe a man which had wyllyngly and of his own accord offered
himself to death / and him in the mean season they did have in reverence and
wourshyppe / as an holy oblation and sacrifice dedicated to god. The manner of
certain paynymes.
And at the years end they did cast him into the sea / thinking and iudgyng
that by the death of that one man / what so ever euylles and misfortunes were
toward the cite: might be turned away and kept from it. And Codrus and
Curtius / and the two Decii are hyghly and studiously praised of authoures:
Ual. max. lib. v. titul^. vi. de pietate erga patriam.
which wyllynglye gave themselves to death for the health and salvation of the
common weal. yt was co^ueniente therefore and according / that a true and an
effectual host and sacrifice should be offered up / not for the incolumite and
preservation of one cite ^ or of one nation: but for the health and salvation
of the hole world / which might take away the other hosts and sacrifices of
all me^ being either superstytyouse or else of small efficacy and strength.
For so great was the charity of Christ / so great was his purite: that he
being ones offered up in sacrifice / might and should suffice to abolishe and
take away all the sins of mankind: although there had been moo worlds
than one. Leuitici. vi.
For this dowtlesse was that very whole bre^te sacrifice / which whole did
brenne and was on fiere with the love of mankind. Exodi.xii.
This was that most pure blood of the unspotted lamb / which sprincled on
the posts / put by the destroynge angel. whi Christ would dye on a cross.
Now the kind and manner of death / besides that it was most paynfull: it
was also most vile and shameful manner of death that could be namely among
the Jews. to whom he was execrable and had in abomination: who so ever did
hang on a tree It must needs be an exceeding great pain: which should for
all men pay and bye out the everlasting pains: and that was an happy and
blessed shame and dishonor: which had to all men opened the way to
everlasting glory. Now is there nothing more execrable and odible to god:
than is sin. This ignomyny and curse he did translate unto himself for a
season: that he might purchase and obtain the blessing of god for us. It did
also pertayne and belong to the faith and credence of the history: that he
should dye condemned by open judgment / and that he should give up the ghost
a high upon the cross: lest onye man might else suspecte and mysdeme /
either that it was no very death: orels that another man hade ben put in
Christ's stead. Last of all / it was conueniente / that he should dye on high
with his arms stretched out abroad which for his unspeakable charity did
couete to embrace all men and wylled all men to be saved / likewise as he
sygnyfienge the kind and manner of his death to his disc^ples / said. Joan.
xi^.
Wha^ I shall be lyfted up from earth: I will draw all things unto mine
owneselfe. And I told the and gave the knowledge also here to fore / yt the
lord came into the world not only to cleanse us / from our sins: For what
causes our lord came in to the worl^e
but also both to show us the way by which we must come to eternal glory /
and also to give strength to our weakness by reason of which we are prone and
ready to fall again into sins / and also are to eble to bear either
prosperity or aduersite but with the one / that is to wit with prosperity we
are corrupted / made wanton / and proud / and with the other we are dismaide /
mated / and stricken into heuinesse and despair. For who so ever with full
faith and trust sets his ties stedfastlye upon Christ fastened on the
cross: that person as he is afraid so often in a certain manner to crucify
Christ again / as he does commit those things / for the washing away of
which he suffered death: who so ever does commit those sins / from which
Christ dyed to make us free: does after a certain manner crucify Christ
again.
even so scasely is there any man so feeble and weak minded / but that he does
more pacie^tly and with more quiet mind suffer the afflictions of this world
/ when he does considre and reckon in his mind / how many things he has
suffered for us: which was free from all inflection of sin. And who can be
found so ungentle and unkind / that he will not love him again: which did so
first love him / and with so great benefyghtes provoke him to love again?
Brefflye all the philosophy and wisdom: all the solace and co^forth / and all the strength of a christian mind is i^ the cross of Chrst. But the
consyderation of these matters belongs not to this business: which we now
purpose and have in hand. DIS. why would he hang in the mids between two
thieves? MAG. To show / that even to malefactors and synnefull persons /
there is hope of salvation / in the mids of their vere ponishementes: if they
will beseech and desire sorowfully the mercy of Christ. DI. Why would he not /
that his legs should be brokend? MAG. Number. ix.
Because it was so darkely prophesied before / you shall break no bone of it.
DI. ye but these things were not so don / because it was prophesied and said
before / that they should be don after such manner: but therefore were they said
before: because god had so eternally ordained and perfixed: that they should be
don in such wise. MA. Thou do very well and a right / to think that there
was nothing don in Christ without skylle / or by fortune and chance: but
that all things were done by the decre and ordinance of eternal god. But yet
the scripture does otherwhiles speak after this manner. vt implerentur
scripture (id est) that the scriptures should be fulfilled. How this
co^iunctio^ vt is taken other whiles in the scripture.
But in this manner of speaking / the conjunction vt id est that does not
betoken the end and final cause: but that / that follows and comes to pass
/ and the proffe of the thing. The scripture went before: the proffe or
perfourmaunce did follow and came after. And it was very semely and convenient /
that / that most sacred and blessed body of Christ should have no manner
faughte or deformite / that is to wit none vnperfighte membre / lame / or
crooked / likewise as it is believed / that our bodies shall not have in the
general resurrection. To cause beleffe of his resurrection: the printes and
tokens of the five wounds were sufficient / which / as it were certain
preciouse stones / do not disfigure that blessed body: but do beautify and
anorne it. And for the same purpose he would na^ that his body should corrupt
and putrify in the grave. Ioannis.xix.
He dyed and gave up the ghost / before it came to the breakyng of the legs /
and he rose again: before that the dead body was corrupted. These things do
so commend the dignite of him: that they do not let or hyndre the verite of
his nature. D Why would Ioannis.xix.
he be laid up into a new grave / in which never any man had been laid as
yet: and besides that cut or hewde out of the natural and strong roche of
stone? whi Christ would be buried in a new sepulcher.
MA. This thing did make partly for the dignite of Christ: and partelye for
the faith and credence of the history But in every one of these things are
hid great mysteryes / which thou shalt than here: when thou have laid
away thine infauncie. i. Cor. iii.
Now we do offer milk unto the as to an infau^te or young babe. D. Seeing
that this history is confirmed and estableshed by so many arguments: have
there ben any me^ which did dowte of the troth? MA. The Jews do grant and
confess / that Jesus was crucified very matter in deed: The Jews.
but they do deny / that he was crucified for the salvation of the world.
There have been also certain christian men / which do profess / yt Christ did
verily suffer in his humanite / and yt for the health of ye world but ye same
did supose raither tha^ fastly affirm / yt likewise as he suffered in his body
here upon earth for live me^: even so his soul did suffer i^ hell for the
souls that were kept and holde^ there / and again that after his
resurrection he was crucified or shall be crucified in ye air for the spretes
of the air. Basilides.
Basilides a man full of pytye (god knows) does deny / that Christ himself
was fastened on the cross: Luce. xxiii.
but he says that one Simon of Cyrene was hanged up in his stead / which was
compelled to be Christ's vicare in bearyng of his cross. But if it were so /
that an other man was crucified in his stead: than did he himself neither dye
/ neither rise again / neither did he redeem us with his own death. But
these are but the dreams and fond fantasies of man's mind. The scripture
does most manifestlye teach us / that Christ has not suffered but ones for
all and that he died upon ye cross under Po^ce Pilate / and that he died not
for any other creatures / save only for the rede^ptio^ of mankind. Saint
Paul says plainly Christ risynge ones from death: Romans vi.
diethe no more death has power no longer over him. And that he diede as
touching to sin: he died but ones for ever / but as touching to that he
lives he lives to god. Peter cries i. Petri. iii.
Christ dyed ones for our sins. Thou hereste here expresselye / that he died
ones.

Thou hereste / that he rose again / and that he shall dye no more / and do
thou say that he died not himself: but that another man was brought in / in
his stead and was his vicare in suffrynge death: likewise as it is read in
poets fables / that in the ilonde called Aulis a whight hynde was conuayde in
/ in the stead of Iphigenia which should have been slain in sacryfyce? And does
another of you crucify his soul again in hell? And another again of you
crucyfye whole Christ again / in the air? Thou hear the prince of Apostles
cryenge openly i. Petri. ii.
Christ suffered for us and wylt thou o Jew / that his death does / not
proufighte or avail onye man? Let us now proceed to other things. DIS. It
follows / he went down to hell. MAG. This is the article / which (as I
said before) Cipriane says not to be hade in ye Roman symbol / no neither
yet to be added in the churches of the East / ye and moreover / although the
symbol of the synod holden at Nice / or of the Synod holden at
Constantinople / is none other thing than a declaration of this symbol / yet
is there not there neither / so much as any thing that is corresponde^t to
this particle. Finally ye very inco^^innite and vnha^dsome ioyni^ge or hanging
togeder of the speech and oration / is an euidente argument / that it is a
percell thruste in among the other articles / by some other man. These words
The article descendit ad inferna was no percelle of the Creed / at the first
making of it.
sepultus est (id est) was buried / do belong to the body / which laid aslepe
by death / does rise again / that is / does as it were waken from sleep. But
these words desce^dit ad inferos.i. he went down to hell / they do refer
unto the soul / which neither was buried / neither did rise again but being
departed and so^dried for a time / shortly after returned again into the dead
body. Whether saint Thomas of Aquine did add this particle I am somewhat in
doubt. There is a certain suspision / that it should be added of some othere
man: at the least by this argument / for that it is not in the mete place. For
wha^ he does make the third article of ye resurrection: he makes the 4.
article of the going down to hell: except peradventure he meante this /
that Christ after that he was risen again from death to life / went down in
body and soul to hell. Another little work / which goes abroad bearing the
title of saint Thomas upon the symbol does interpret and declare the contrary
here of / and does use also a contrary order / for there the going down to
hell goes before the resurrection / how be it this said opuscle / although it
be a clarkely and an holy work: yet it seems not to be the work of Thomas of
Aquine. DI. Why was not this particle added or put to? why this article was
lef^ out.
^A. Because the fathers of old time did with great relygyon and fear take heed and beware / that they would not affirm any thing / namely in the creed /
which were not expressed in the holy scriptures of both testamentes. Now
such manner articles are all the other: only this one excepted. DI. How tha^
durst they / that came after / be so bold to add it? MA. Because they seemed
to themselfes / that they had gathered this evidently enough of the holy
scriptures diligently boulted and examined / to the which they do add some
reasones also / not those verily most strong and inui^cible: but yet not
utterly vnprobale They do aledge and bring forth these authorites of the
psalms. Psalm. xxi.
Et in puluerem mortis deduxisti me.i. And thou have brought me into the duste
of death And Psalm. xxix.
Que vtilitas in sanguine meo du^ descendo in corruptionem.i. what proufighte
is there in my blood: whils I do go down into corruption? And again Descendi
in limu^ profundi et non est substantia. Psalm. lxviii.
And that also. Domine eduxisti ab inferno anim^m meam saluasti me a
des^endentibus in lacum (that is to say) Lord thou haste brought forth my
soul from hell thou have saved me from the noumbre of them that go down into
the pit. Psalm. xv.
And that also Non derelinques anima^ meam in inferno.i. Thou shalt not leave
my soul in hell. Acts.ii,
Which testimony / Peter / in the Acts / does teach to have been prophesied
before of Christ and not of David: Psalm. lxxxvii.
so as the Jews did interpret it. The allege also this text Eruiste animam
meam ex inferno inferiori.i. Thou haste delivered my soul from the nether more
hell. Again this text / estimatus sum cum descendentibus in lacum / factus sum
sicut homo sine adiutorio / inter mortos liber (id est) I was reputed among
men going down into a pytte. I was made as a man without help / among dead
me^ free and at liberty. Also that text of Ose^ the prophet Os^e. xiii.
O mors ero mors tua et morsus tuus inferne (that is to say) O death I will be
thy death / and I shall be thy bytte: o hell. They bring forth also of the
gospel of Mathue the words of sayncte Johan Baptist / Art thou he / which
shalt come? Math. ^^.
or shall we wait after another? for this speech some me^ do interpret of
Chistes going down to hell. They aledge also that text of the Epistle o^
Peter. Christ was mortified and killed in deed as touching to his flesh: i.
Pet. iii.
but was quickened in spirte / in which spirit he went also and preached to
the spirits that were in prison. They allege also of the.xxiiii. chapitoure
of Ecclesiastici / that which was spoken and said under the person of
wisdom. Penetrabo inferiores parts terre / et inspiciam omnes dormientes / et
illuminabo omnes sperantes in domino (id est) I shall enter into the lower
parts of the earth: and I will look upon all them that sleep / and I will
lyghten all them that hope and trust in the lord. And many other like places
of scripture. But there is none of all these authorites / that may constrayne
him / that list to ihwar^e and find cauyllations: to believe / that the soul
of Christ went down by it self personal^ye to hell / or (as they call it)
to lymbum. For the scripture does oftentimes call death / and the grave / by
^his name inferos which same word is englysshed other whiles hell / as for
exaumple in the.xliiii. chapitoure of Genesis. what this word infery does
signify otherwhiles in the scripture.


Morietur et deducent famuli tu^ canos eius cum dolor ad inferos (that is to
say) He shall dye and thy servants shall bring his hoar hears with sorrow
to his grave. He called here the aged body of Jacob: horeheares: and by this
word inferos / he meante the sepulture or grave. And this thing does saint
Cipriane in few words in a manner show / when after that he had said
before that this partycle is not had neither in the churches of the west /
nor in the churches of the east / he adds afterward these words.

Uis tame^ verbi videtur eadem esse in eo quod sepultus dicitur (that is too
say) How be it there seems to be the same str^ngthe of the word: in that /
that he is said to have been buried. As who should say / that descendere ad
inferna / were naught else: but to be buried in the grave / which our lord
speaking of his own buryall called to be in the heart of the earth. In these
testimonies which they allege of the scripture there are certain / which are
well nere of no wayghte / but there is none of the^ / but either it is dark
with the myste of allegory: orels it does receive diverse and manifold
interpretations. Neither are the reasons / which they do bring: of much more
wayghte. Among which one is plainly and utterly rejected and refused. DISC.
which is that? MAG. Because orygynall sin did not only bring the death of
body / but also the tourmente and pain of souls / that by the reasone of it
they should want the vysyon and syghte of gods face: therefore they do
suppose it to be conuenyente and according / that likewise as Christ by the
death of his body / did abolyshe and take away bodyly pain: even so by
suffrynge in his soul / he should take away the pain of the souls. DIS. Are
we than at liberty / whether we list / to believe or not to believe this
particle? MAG. if the universal church has now received it: it is not lawful
for the not to believe it. Nota.
It is sufficient for the / to profess that Christ did so desce^de ad
inferos: as the scripture and the church does think and mean. But yet as it
is a point of Christian wisdom not to believe very lyghtlye that thing for
certain and undoubted / which is not expressed in the holy scriptures: even
so is it a point of Christian mekenes not to refuse prowdly and frowardly
that thing / which the relygyouse contemplacyon of good and godly men has
taught / either to the solace and comforthe / or else to the erudition of them
that do believe / of which sort are these things also. That the holy ghost
took one of the most purest drops of blood out of the virgin Mary's heart
/ and laid it down into her matrice: and that hereof suddenly was made the
perfighte body of a man / so small as is a little spyder which is but even
now cropen forth from the egg: But yet with all the members fulle fynyshed
and perfyghte: and that in the same momente a soul was infused and put into
it / being even very than forthewith as perfyghte in all powers and qualytyes
/ as it is mow in heaven / likewise / that they do teach / that Christ by the
reason of the complexion of his humane body (which they will to have been in
him far most subtyle / and so therefore of most quick and sharpefelynge)
did suffer more greuouse and bitter pains than any man may possibly suffer /
the pain of them only excepted / which are perpetuallye damned in hell.
These things and such other like unto these / let them be so herd as
devout and holy contemplations of men concerning Christ: but not as articles
of the faith. Many such manner things have certain men ymagyned also about
this particle / which we have showed to be an addytyon to the Creed / telling
what persons Christ did bring out from hell / and whom he did leave there
stylle / and what things with what words he did speak to every one of the
cyrcles. But this is sufficient for us / that he was ones in flesh borne a
very man / that he did verily suffer passion / that he has verily died / and
ben buried. And that he has verylye reuyued again / the very same soul
returned again into the own natural body. It folowethe / He rose again the
third day / unless Christ had risen again: all hope of immortalyte had been
quite and clean taken from us. But he rose again according to the scriptures
/ for this has the symble read in the mass / added: likewise as the blessed
Apostle Paul said.

i. Cor^ xv.
I have taught to you principallye that which I received and learned of the
lord that Christ has died ones for our sins according to the scriptures
/ and that be has been buried / and that he has risen again the third day
according to the scriptures. But though the resurrection of our lord has been
shawwed before by so many figures of which our lord himself did expou^de and
declare one / that is to wit Math. xii. Ione.v.
of Jonas / which was i^ the belly of a whal iii. days and.iii. nyghtes / and
though it have been promised by so many oracles and prophesies of so many
Prophets / and also so ofte^tymes showed before of Christ himself with
euidente words Luce. xviii.
nothy^ge darkened with any myste of Trope or Allegory. And finally has been
confyrmed with so many euydente testimonies of the Apostles: Math. xx. Mar. x.
yet all this not withstanding / there have not lacked some men which in very
deed (as it is wont to be said in the proverb) in the very bright light of
the son were blind and could not see. Cerinthus.
For Cerinthus said / that Christ is not yet risen again but that he shall in
time to come long herafter / rise again. Other some again did feign / that
Christ himself is in deed risen again / but yet that our bodies shall never
reuyue nor rise again whom saint Paul does openly confute / gatherynge /
that it does necessaryly follow / i. Cor. xv.
If Christ did not rise again: that neither shall we rise again and if we
shall rise again: that Christ must needs than have risen again. For
likewise as he did suffer for our sakes / that we should be delivered by him
from eternal death / even so has he also risen again for our sakes / that
by him we should get and obtain eternal life. i. Cor. xv.
He rose being the first fruit of them that sleep. But he that is the first
can not be alone / neither will the head leave or forsake his members. Certain
men following Ualentine for their authoure / do grant and confess the
resurrection of the spirit and of the soul: Ualentine.
but the resurrection of the bodies they do deny / not withstondynge / that in
Christ was showed the example and pattern of our resurrection. Now he rose
again whole / that is to say both in body and soul. But what should a man
strive against them / that do deny the euidente scripture / and agreynge
with it self in so many places? For nothing has been taught more diligently
of the Euangelystes: than the arguments and proffes of the resurrection. And
saint Paul does not only confirm the resurrection in every place: but he
does also describe the manner of the resurrection to the Corinthianes / and to
the Thessalonianes. i. Cor. xv. i. Thessa. iiii.
For as for the opinion of them / that were called Chiliaste Chiliaste.
(which did dream / that by the space of a thousand years / after the risynge
again of our bodies / we shall enjoy plentuosly in this world all such manner
pleasures / wherewith the bodyly senses are delyted and pleased) it is not
worthy to be called an opinion / but raither a prodigiouse and a wondrefull
mad error. And as for all the cauillations which man's wit does
engendre / how or by what means the same body / which has been so many
manner ways changed from one thing into another / can be restored again the
very same in noumbre: these cauyllations (I say) are shaken of and put away
by faith and beleffe / by which we do believe / that he is god / and that he
is almighty / which works all these things / and that he is not subject
under the laws of nature: which did create and make nature. And what marvel
is it / if he does restore the body of that thing / that is: which did
first at the beginning make heaven and earth and aungelles all of nothing.
And seeing that we do daily see so many miracles in the works of nature / as
for exau^ple / of a very little sede to rise a great strong tree: and of a
gressehoper now being old / by casting of his skin to fly forth a young
one: and of a Eruoa (id est) cankerworme ready to dye / to lepeforthe a lusty
and a swyfte Papilionem.i. butterfly: why should any thing seem vnbeleueable /
which / god that is almighty does work contrary to the laws and course of
nature? It follows / he ascended into heaven / and sytteth on the right hand
of god the father. Joan. iii.
Noma^ (says saint Johan) goes up into heaven: save he which has come
down from heaven / the sone of man that is in heaven. The word or sone of god
came down from heaven / not that he departed from the father or changed his
place (for as much as the divine nature is so in every place that yet that
notwithstanding it is contained in no place) but the same word / which by
dyspe^sation did come into the womb of the blessed virgin / after that he
had finished the mystery of our redemption: Actuum.i.
being than incarnate did in very deed ascend up into heaven / withdrawynge
the syghte of his body from his disciples / and caryeng or conuayenge up the
minds of them to heavenly things / that they should give themselves mete
vessels and apt to receive the spirit that was to come. Neither did he lay
from himself the body: which he had taken unto him and leave it in the son
/ so as wretched Salencus did fondlye ymagine. Salencus.
So he which as touching his divine nature: was always in the same glory
with his father is now with his humane nature also set in the glory of his
father / being made lord of all things which are in heaven and in earth. D.
It seems not unreasonable / nor vnmet to assygne or give unto Christ a right
part or a left part / as concerning his body. But in the father to ymagyne
any such manner thing: it seems too come nere and to be agreynge unto the
error of the Anthropomorphites. MAG. To sytte on the right hand of the
father is spoken not without a trope or figure / so that thou most understand
by this manner of speaking / that he is egal in honor / and fellow in
raygnynge with the father. what is mea^t when it is said / that Christ sits
on the fathers right hand.
DISC. But why did they not rayther express this sentence and meaning by
plain and propre or mete words / saying / he went up into heaven / where he
raygnethe egall to the father? MAGS. I have told the alredye / that the
scripture does oftentimes shape and apply her language unto our affections.
Now the creed does here co^trefait the word of the holy scripture / for thus
speaks the holy ghost in the psalms of god the father and of Christ
glorified. Psalm. c.ix.
The lord said to my lord sytte thou on my right hand. And our lord
himself says in the Gospel. Math. xxvi.
But yet for all that I say to you / hereafter you shall see the son of man
sitting on the right hand of god. Likewise Peter the Apostle speaking of
Christ says. i. Pet. ii.
which is syttyng in heaven at the right hand of god. In like manner saint
Paul writes to the Ephesyanes. Ephe. i.
According to the workynge of his mighty power / which he wroughte in Christ
Jesus / setting him on his own right hand in heavenly things above all rule
/ power might / and dominati^ns / and above every name which is named not
only in this world / but also in the world to come. Moreover saint Steven
in the Acts saw Actuum.vii.
the heue^s open / and Jesus standing on the right hand of god. DISC. How
did saint Steven see him stand: How Christ is said to sit and how to stand
on the right hand of the father.
which in other places is said to sytte? MAG. Here also know thou to be a
trope. To sytte is a point of one that rests / of one that reigns and of a
judge. To stand belongs to one that succurreth or helps. He sytteth:
which without care governs all things. He stands being ready to help al
those that desire help of him. In that he is a judge: he is said to sit in
that he is an advocate. He is said to stand i. Joan. ii.
we have (says saint Paul) an advocate in heaven. DIS. But Christ as
concer^ynge his humane nature is not egall to the father. MAG. How could that
/ that is but a creature: be egall to the creator? But for cause of the unity
of the person / all those things are well and a right given to Christ:
which are agreynge to him as touching his humane nature / so that we do use
the names or vocables of the person / or vocabulis suppositi / as some other
men do call it. DISC. In as much as Mat. xxviii.
Christ does promise that himself will continue and abide with us unto the
end of the world: Actuum.i.
why was he lyfted up into heaven bodyly in the syghte of al his disciples? M.
To this question does the apostle make answer in the third chapter to the
Colossianes Seche you those things that are above where Christ is sittyng on
the right hand of god. This sight was showed to the bodyly eyes of them: to
the end that he would kendle and inflame our minds from earthely cares / unto
the desire of the heavenly life. whereof we be assured by Christ's passion and
death.
Therefore that god has for cause of our salvation sent his own son into
this world / and has d^lyuered him unto the death of the cross: it makes
us certain and out of doubt / that by him we are delivered from the kingdom
of the devil / and from the bond of sins. And in that he rose again:
whereof by his resurrection.
^here is given sure trust and hope to us that we shall revive again at that
day / which he has wylled to be unknown to us: even with the same bodies
which we do now bear about. whereof by his ascension
And in that he has ascended into heaven: he has by an euidente argument
taught / that we should not seche true felicite here in this world / but that
we should use this world as it were a thorowefare / i. Cor. vii.
as though we did not use it / and that we should translate all our cares and
thoughts unto that heavenly and eternal life. whereof by that he siteth on the
right hand of the father.
And in that he siteth on the right hand of the father: it does engendre and
cause in us a great securite / so that we do not fear any of all the
displeasures or fearful things / that are in the world / for as much as we
have so friendly and also so mighty an advocate in heaven. But lest this so
great goodness of the lord might provoke us to sin ye more boldly and more
largely: it is added strayghtewayes after. From thense shall he con^ to judge
the quick and the dead: that we should have understanding and knowledge / that
such persons ought there to look for a sharp sentence of the judge without
any mercy or favor: which here have despised and would not regard the
goodness of ye redemer. The more that has been given to us: Luce. xii.
so much the more shall be required of us / and the strayghter account shall
we give. For he shall come than not in the form and manner of a seruau^te: but
in the majesty of his father / so as he himself speaks evidently in the
gospel of Mathue. Math. xxv.
when the son of man shall come in his majesty / and all the angels with him:
than shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty / and all peoples shall be
gathered together before him? There shall be made an euidente and one
everlasting separation and disseuerynge of the godly people / Math. xiii.
from the wicked and ungodly people: when the tra^mell ne^ shall be full drawn
to the sea bank. The same things does Peter preach in the.x. chapitoure of
the Acts. This is he / which is ordained of god ye judge of the quick and of
the dead. Actuum.x.
He which here did suffer / and was contented to be judged unjustly for our
sakes: shall there judge the whole world / and shall render or give to every man
according to his works / Math. xxv.

Ioannes.v.


whether they be good / or badde DIS. why would god / that the day of
iudgeme^te should be uncertain and unknown to all men? why god would the day
of general judgment and the day of every man's death to be unknown to us.
MAG. Uerily for the same cause / for which he would that each one of us
should be most certain of his own dyinge day: and yet for all that be
uncertain of the same (for there is no man / that dowteth / that hym^selfe
shall ones dye: but no man does yet for all that know certainly / when he
shall dye) to thentente that we should every hour be ready to depart and dye /
if god shall call us from hence. DIS. why is it added here the quick and the
dead? what is me^te in the Creed by the quycke and the dead.
For how can dead bodies be judged? M. The symbol / i as much as it is whole
taken out of the scriptures: it does very conveniently and accordyngly
countrefayte and express the words of the scripture. Certain men do
interpret here by the quick godly persons / and by the dead ungodly
persons: but this interpretation is somewhat to far fetched. To the symbol
which was ordained for simple persons: simple and plain things are mete and
convenient. The dead.
It is more probable by the dead to understand those that have departed from
their bodies before the day of judgment (for as soon as they shall be revived
and risen again: The quick.
they shall be judged) and by the quycke / those / whom that day shall find
living in body / which persons certain men do believe / that in the very
taking up and passage into the air / they shall dye / and forthwith live /
again. Other some again do think / that they shall not dye: Two opinions
concerning them / which shall be living at the day of dome.
but yet that they shall be changed to immortalite. Neither of these.ii.
sentences or opinions does the auctorite of the church reiecte or disalowe /
albeit yet that opinion which thinks / that they / which shall than be
found living in body / shall not dye / but shall be translated to
immortalyte: is more agreyng to the words of sayncte Paul in the.xv. chapter
of the first epistle to the Corinthianes / and in the.iiii. chapter of the
first epistle to the Thessalonianes. But devout faith does not love
co^tencion. DI. what need any judgment to be made than: A notable qu^stion.
seeing that the souls forthwith after that they are departed from the body /
are judged already: so yt either if they have departed fromhence being pure and
clean / they do go to the heavenly life / orels if they do depart in bondage of
sine / they are drawn strayghte to hell. Orels if they be defiled with any
small spots / they are borne into the clensynge fyere of purgatory what so
ever or what manner one so ever that fyere of purgatory be? MA. Answer.
There were certain men / which taught that neither the wicked spirits /
neither the wicked souls / shall be given to eternal ponishementes and pains
before that last day of the world: It is an heresy condemned by the church,
that no soul shall neither be in heaven, nor hell before the day of do^e
neither that the souls of good and godly men shall enjoy the heavenly life
before the said day. But the opinion of these men the auctorite of the church
has rejected and disalowed. But this thing is prouably believed that to the
wicked spirits after that general judgment the tourme^tes and pains shall
be augmented and increased: and that wicked men shall than fully suffer pains
in soul and body both together / likewise as also the felicite of good men
shall than be full and perfighte / wha^ they shall have received their body than
being glorified: that the same body / which they have had a minister of good
works / and a partener of affliccions / the same they may have also a fellow
and partener with them of reward and joy. D. If all the men and women which
have been by the space of so many thousand years syns the creation of the world
/ shall stand before Christ's seat of judgment: I beseech you / what court
shall that be / able to receive and co^tayne so great a multitude: Or what time
shall be sufficient to the discussyng and examynynge of so many men's deeds?
M. The scripture forsothe (as I have told the heretofore) does attempre and
shape her speech according to the affections of men / applyinge her self to
our dull and slow understanding: when she says that To. xiiii.
all men shall be presented and brought forth unto the judgment seat of
Christ. Likewise and after the same manner as it says / that some men shall
be in danger of judgment / Mar. v.
and other some in danger of a counsel and other again in danger of hell
fyere. And also when it says / that of every idle word an accomp^e is to be
given at the day of judgment. Math. xii.
Again when it tells / what the judge shall say to them that shall stand
on the right hand and what they shall answer to him again / Math. xxv.
likewise what they shall answer / or what shall be said to them / which
shall s^and on the left hand. The judgment of god / is done far after
another manner / tha^ the judgment of men is done. And yet shall it not
therefore not be verily done: because it shall not be done after the manner of
men. This is very true that Christ shall appear in his body glorified unto all
men / to good men unto their solace and coumforthe / to wicked men to their
fear and disco^forthe. For this thing do the aungelles expressly say in the
acts / Actuum.i.
which did appear forthewith after that our lord was ascended into heaven.
This Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven: even after ye same manner
shall he com / as you have seen him going. He shall com even the very same / he
shall be seen in the shape of man / but than shynynge with the glory of
immortalyte. The general judgment shall be don in the twync^i^g of an eye.
But all this busynes shall be done in a mome^te and as you would say in the
twynclynge of an eye. Neither shall there than need any long or dylygente
e^amination or trial: when all the secrets of me^nes hertes shall be open /
and when every man's own conscience shall condemn him. And the bodies being
than changed to immortalyte shall not tha^ (as they do now) occupye space of
place / as touching to the three manner dymensions / that is to wit length /
bredthe / and depthe: but innumerable bodies shall may than be contained in a
very little space. Forels man's wit might greatly marvel how it may be /
that hell / which they do prouably put too be in the loweste parts of the
earth: shall be able to receive so many bodies. DISC. why does the quiere /
in the Creed that they do sing: add here these words Cuius regni non erit
finis (that is to say) of whose kingdom there shall be none end MAG. This
particle was added out of the words of the angel / which (as we do read in
Luke Luce. i.
) spoke in this wise to the blessed virgin. And the lord god shall give too
him the seatte of his father / and he shall raygne in the house of Jacob for
evermore. why in the Creed of the mass / it is added. Cuius regni no^ ^rit
finis.
And of his kingdom there shall be none end. And this particle was added and
put to because of certain men / which dreamed certain wonderful
blasphemies of the periodes and reuolutions of years / which Plato did put /
of which Origene took his eroure (if it be so / that he did think that thing
in very deed: Origenes.
which he has recyted and reherced / rayther than affirmed with asseueratio^
in his books) that is to wit / that after certain thousands of years / of
fendes shall be made aungells / and of aungells be made fendes. And that they
which are damned in the fyere of hell: shall ones be delyuerde from their
pains / and being purged / shall return again to felycyte and bliss / and
finally that Christ shall be crucified again. And so that the kingdom /
which Christ has purchaced and gotten too himself by his death: should
ones have an end. This is a more fond and folyshe blasphemye than that it is
worthy to be confuted. But yet because there were some among the Greeks /
which did somewhat easteme and regard this dream or tryflynge opinion: the
churches of the east did add this particle. And of his kingdom there shall
be none end.

The kingdom of the devil is dissembled for a season: which even now also
does rebel and war against the kingdom of Christ. Likewise the raygne of
Antichriste shall last but a while / but the kingdom of Christ / after that
it shall be cleansed and rid clean from all rebellion of the evil persons:
it shall continue and endure for ever / so as the Prophet Daniell hat
evidently prophesied in the.vii. chapitoure. For after yt he has first
described his coming with majesty / and with many thousands of angels / and
by and by / after has described the dredefull judgment / he adds
consequently these words.

And he has given to him power: Dani. vii.
honor / and kingdom / and all peoples / and tribes / and languages / shall
do service to him The power of him shall be an eternal power: which shall not be
taken away from him / and his kingdom shall be a kingdom / which shall not be
corrupted or destroyed / thus farforthe this Creed was sufficie^te: if the
world had by simple faith holden and kept fast that / which was taught
them. But for as much as the peruersite of heretics did bring in certain
wicked heresies and erroniuse opinions of the third person / which is the
holy ghost: and because it seemed to have been somewhat to darkely spoken and to
obscure signification to have been given of the dispensation of the church in
this world: therefore was this part added / which both does more clearly
and evidently challenge and maintain to the holy ghost the divine nature /
which he has common to him with the father and the sone: and also does
plainly and lyghtesomly express and declare / what governance is in Christ's
mystical body / by the holy ghost / it does therefore repete again the
third person saying I believe in the holy ghost: that by the same words
professyng him in the third place / it might declare the distinction of
the.iii. persons as touching to their propreties and the egalyte and eue^nes
of the^ as touching to their nature: like wise as no man does believe with a
chrste^ beleffe / no man does set his most confidence and trust) in a
creature / but in the only god alone. He that professes himself to believe in
the holy ghost: dowtles he professes him to be god / and that no^ another god
/ but the same god. Erroneouse opinions concerning the holy ghost.
Certain men have said that the holy ghost is not a substauce: but that he is
naught else but the concitation or styrrynge of a godly mind. But this motion
or styrrynge of our mind is in deed caused and comes of the holy spirit: but
it is not the very holy ghost self (likewise as imagination comes of ye
soul / but yet is it not the very soul self) For the said motion or
styrrynge of the mind in us is an accidente: but that thing that is god / is
neyder accidente / neither is it mengled to any accidente. Other some again
have said / that the holy ghost is a creature added as a minister or
servant to the sone / whom also they do make a creature. And these men do
openly deny the holy ghost to be god. Mat. xxviii.
But our lord when in the form and manner of baptisyng he does join the
father / the sone / and the holy ghost: all.iii. together / he does not
mengle or join a creature with the creator / neither an accidente with a
substance / but he has expressed three persons all of one essence. But
because the erroures concerning the holy ghost have not very greatly trobled
and encombred or febled ye church of Rome / but have most specially and
chefly raged among the Greeks: The errores concerning the holy ghost raged
most in Greece lond^.
therefore has ye symbol which was made in the council holden at
Constantinople / added and put to / certain words of the holy ghost /
calling him dominu^ lord and viuificatorem.i. quickener or maker alive. why
the holy ghost is called lord
In that it does call him lord: it does make him egal to the sone excludyng
the name of a minister or servant / for there are not many lords / for the
sone is not called lord of the holy ghost: but the lord of all things
created / which dominum or lordshippe is common to all.iii. persons. How be
it this greek word Kyrios is not always a word of dominion or lordshyppe:
Kyrios.
but otherwhiles it is a word betokenynge authorite / now is the holy ghost
author of all those scriptures: which the church acco^p^eth for divine
scriptures and of which the au^horite is inviolable but because the father has
in ye gospel testified and w^tnessed of the sone. Math. iii.
This is my well-beloved sone harken to him / geuynge to him / most sovereign
and high authorite: lest any man should think or suppose that the authorite
of the holy spirit were less than the authorite of the sone / they did add
and put to / Pneuma kyrion.i. the spirit the author / and in that it does call
him viuificatore^.i. quickener or lyfegeuer: Et spu^m dominum.

whythe same ghost is called quickener


it does again make him egall to the sone and to the father / for our lord
says in the gospel of Johan. As the father does raise quicken up / and make
alive those that are dead: Ioannis.v.
so does the sone also quicken and make alive who^ he list. Lest any man
therefore should think / that the holy ghost were here excluded: they added ^t
viuificante^.i. and quicknyng or making alive. The difference between the
speaking of the sone and the speaking of the holy ghost and the difference
between the qckenyng or raisyng up dead men of the one / and of the other.
And likewise as this difference there is / that the sone has spoken openly
in flesh / and the holy ghost has spoken by the prophets and the same daily
does speak secretly by the church: even so did the sone bodily raise up dead
men being both the author and also ye first frut of resurrection: but the
holy ghost by pardonynge and forgeuyng sins / does spiritually quicke^ and
make alive / for sin is the death of the soul / from which to revoke and
call again any man / is a greatt thing than it was to raise up Lazarus
being.iiii. Ioannis.xi.
days dead out of his grave save only yt al things are like much or egally
easy to be done of god. But because this outward spirit or breathe is a thing
inconstante / waueryng / and unstable: lest any man should ymagyne any
semblable and like thing of the holy ghost / they called him Kyrion: that is
to say: of substanciall and strong inviolable authorite. Joan. xv.
And in the gospel of Johan our lord himself calls him the spirit of
truth. Thus much as touching difference. Quickener.
Now on the other side because by the sendynge forth and receyuynge in again
of breath or air by course / we do live bodyly: the holy ghost very
conveniently and accordyngly is called spiritus viuificator.i. a quickenynge
spirit which does give unto us / causes that we do live as touching the
better part of us / that is to wit the soul. Again because this breathe or
wind seameth a certain cruel and unmerciful thing: when it does raise or
stir up waves in the sea / and wha^ it does cause the earth to shake or
quake / and when it tearethe trees in sondre: they do give to the holy ghost
goodness. DI. why he is called the holy spirit.
Why is he called holy? MA. For a difference from other spirits / for we do
read in the scriptures: that Saul had an evil spirit sent of the lord / and
that a lyinge spirit was in the mouth of the prophets. i. Regum. xix.
and.xvi.
We read also of the spirit vertiginis: of the spirit of sothesayers / of ye
spirit of gelosy / we Leuit. xx. Actuum.xvi.
read these words / spiritu^ pessimu^.i. the most evil spirit / the spirit
of fornication / Actuum. xix.
spiritum nequam.i. the wicked spirit / the unclean spirit / the spirit of
this world / the spirit of Satan / and we read also the proud and high
spirits of man / as in the.xvi. chapitoure of the proverbs. Ante ruinam
exaltabitur spiritus.i. Before his decay and fall his spirit shall be lyfted
up in pride. what meruailouse cha^ges the holy ghost works in man's soul.
From all these spirits is the holy ghost separated and disseuered / which
makes men for proud and highmynded / meke and mylde / which ryddeth and
delyuereth men from all company and fellowship of Satan / which inspireth to
m^n the very despisynge of this world / which by faith purifieth and
cleanses the hertes of men / which driuethe away all i. Cor. xiii.
malice and wickedness / which gives true charity / that is not misdemyng
neither i. Cor. ii.
thynket any evil / which opens ye secreth mysteries of ye scriptures which
ledeth into every verite and troth. D. Johan. xvi.
Are not aungelles also called spiritus sancti id est holy spirits? MA. Yes
verily / and so are they in very deed. So also the spirit of man is well
called holy: but there is but one spirit alone / which is by nature holy /
and which of it self does sanctify and make holy all things / that are
verily holy. Spiritus.
What so ever ^hynge is without body: by a general name is called spiritus a
spirit or ghost. Johan. iiii.
So is god in the gospel called a spirit which name is commune to all the
three persons as concerning the divine nature / but when we do proprely and
specially mean and signify the third person: By what names the holy ghost
is called in the scripture.
we do call him the holy spirit or ghost / the spirit of god / the spirit
of Christ / spiritum paracletum.i. the spirit that is co^forter or advocate /
and the spirit of troth. And against them which denied that the prophets
made their prophecies by the inspiration of the holy ghost / but by a
phanaticall or mad and vain spirit: the Synod of Nice or of Constantinople
has added this particle Qui locutus est per prophetas (that is to say) which
spoke by the prophets: that we should understand and have in knowledge / that
both testame^tes were ^aughte and given by one and ye same spiri^e / and that
i^ was none other spirit which spoke by the mouth of the holy prophets:
tha^ even the very self same Luce. iii.
which descended upon our lord in the likeness of a dowe and in the likeness
of fyere came upon Actuum.ii.
the disciples / and which even this day rests between the breasts of the
spousesse the church. A notable question.
DI. Did the holy ghost take upon him the body in which he appeared: so as
Christ took his body unto him? M. Answer.
No verily / for Christ took an humane body into the unite of personage: It was
no. natural body that the holy ghost appeared in.
but the holy ghost did so take unto him a body / as angels do oftentimes
appear in the likeness of a man. Those are but bodies assumpte / and not
natural bodies. The same synod did add these words also.

Qui cum patre et filio simul adoratur et conglorificatur.i. Which is
worshipped and glorified together with the father and the son: to thente^^e
that they might the more exclude the blasphemy of them / which do make the
holy ghost inferior to the son. For creatures are glorified and honored: but
with the father and the son nothing is honored / save only that / that is god.
Under god and for gods sake / holy men also are honored but with god /
nothing is honored or glorified / but that which is all one with him. And for
the same purpose also is added this clause. Qui ex patre filioque procedit
(that is to say) which procedethe of the father and the sone. For as the
son is argued and proved to be of the same substance with the father /
because he is begotten of the father: even so is it concluded and gathered that
the holy ghost also has the same nature with them both / for as much as he
prosedeth and comes forth of them both: how be it these words filioque.i.
and of the sone / seems to have been added of the Latyne men / likewise as in
the symbol of Atanasius: for as much as this particle neither is had in the
Greek symbol / which we had set before the new testamente in our second
edition of it / neither yet in any symbol which is recited in the canon law
/ for I suppose it was not than yet received / namelye in the churches of the
east / that the holy ghost does proceed from both / neither was the
confession and knowlegynge here of exacted of Christen men / but it was
sufficient to profess / that he proc^ded from the father / and that he did
continue and abide in the son / as it is expressed in the life of sayncte
Andru^ the apostle. Not for that they did deny him to proceed also from the
son: but for that they durst not fastly affirm this thing / until that our
lord did reuele and show it also unto them. For not every thing that is sent
of any person / does forthwith proceed from the substance of him / of whom
it is sent. A temporal sendynge / is one thing: and an eternal procession
or coming forth / is another thing. D. Seeing that the fathers with so many
words did study and go about to exclude inequalite why did they not breffly
and expressly pronounce / that the holy ghost did proceed being god of god: in
as much as they have diligently expressed of ye son / that he is god of god /
light of light / very god of very god? Deum de deo / lu^^en de lumine / deum
verum de deo vero.
For so should all cauillations utterly have been excluded. M. To this / I can
not tell what answer I should make / save only / that the meruailouse
religion and fear / The religion and dread that the old fathers had to speak
of divine things.
which the old fathers had to speak of the diu^ne matters / and the wicked
babbling and talkatiuenes of certain persons / was ye cause / why they had
lever show and demonstrate by circumlocution the name of god / than to
express it: to then tente that both the godly minds should understand and
perceive the mystery / and wicked persons should not be provoked to
blasphemy. But that thing / which that Synod did utter by circu^locution:
sayncte Athanase does e^pressly pronounce / saying. The father is god / the son
is god / the holy ghost is god. And yet are not there three gods / but there is
but one god. D. Why do they attribute and assign to the holy ghost / goodness
and charity? why goodness and ^harite are attributed to the holy ghost.
M. Because unto goodness or benignite two things do belong / that is to wit
for geuenes of sins / and geuyng of gifts: unto charity appertains
conglutination or ioynyng together. Likewise as the members and lymmes of our
body / do cleue together whole by ye be^^fight of the spirit: even so the
mystical body of Christ is joined and knyt together by the holy ghost /
Christ in the spirit of god did cast out devils. Luc. xi. Math. xii.
And he calls the holy ghost the spirit of god. But by sin wicked
spirits do reign in a man / as our lord did manifestly teach in the parable
of the spirit / that was driven out / which returned again into his empty
house with seven spirits more wicked than himself. L^c. xi. Math. xii.
Therefore the good spirit is conveniently said / by abolishyng and puttyng
away sins to drive out evil spirits. Which when it is done: it does not
suffer the house to be empte or void / but does garnishe and adourne it with
diverse gyf^es or graces / that the vices driven out should have none entrau^ce
in again. And therefore Math. xii^
that blasphemy which is committed against the holy ghost / is said in the
gospel to be irremissible / and such as can not be forgeuen. For what hope of
remi^^ion does that man leave to himself: which does provoke the author of
remission and forgeuenes? For charity (as says say nete Peter) does cover or
hyde the multitude of sins. i. Petri. iii^.
And to that sinful woman / of whom mention is made in the gospel / many
sins were forgeuen / because she loved much. Luc. vii.
Beside this / our lord geuyng auctorite to his apostles of forgeuyng sines /
breathed upon the^ sayi^g. Take you the holy ghost. Benignite or liberalyte is
declared in this / that the gifts whi^he sayncte Paul reherceth very many and
diverse: Joan. xx.

Goodness or liberalite.

i. Cor. xii. Romans xii. i. Cor. xii.


are called the benefightes of one spirit / which distributeth at his own
pleasure to every man / according to the measure and quantite of his faith /
yt is the manner of the^ that do triu^phe: to scatter and cast from a high
place / monaye or other gifts among the people. So likewise Christ after
that he was ascended into heaven / there to make a triumph: according to the
prophecy of the Psalm writer He led captivity captive leding away with him
those whom he had taken out from hell / neither co^te^ted with this: Psalm. lxiii.
Ephesi. iiii.
he gave gifts to men left behynd him i^ earth that is to wit / ye gifts
of prophecy / ye gifts of tongues / the gifts of knowledge the gifts of
curing maladies or diseases / the gifts of expulsions against poisons and
wicked spirits. Brefly he gave the hole company of all virtues / which gifts
eue^y one Christ has distributed to his servants / and daily does
distribute by his spirit. what this word bonus does signify otherwhiles.
For this word bonus.i. good to latyne men do^he sown and signify
otherwhiles mylde and gentel or merciful / and otherwiles bountuose and
liberal. Therefore saint Paul prouokyng the Galathians from vengeance to
humanite and gentylnesse / does in culke and often repete the name of the spirit
saying. Galat. vi.
if we live in the spirit obrethere^: let us walk also in the spirit if any
man shall be prevented or taken in any sin: you that are spiritual instruct
and amend him that is such one / in the spirit of mildnes. David says.
Psalm. c. xlii.
Thy good spirit shall co^ducte and led me in to the right land. And saint
Paul says. Romans v.
The charity of god is spredde or poured abroad in our hertes: by the holy
spirit / which is given to us. Romans viii.
And writynge to the Romans / he calls that the spirit of adoption / by
which we do cry father father. Like things does he write to the Galathians
Galat. iiii.
Because you are the sons of god: god has sent the spirit of his sone in
our hertes cryinge father father These two words so^e and father are names of
love / which no man can truly pronounce and speak / but by the be^efighte of
the holy ghost: likewise as according to the testimony of Sayncte Paul. 1.
Cor. xii.
Noman does call Jesus lord / but in the holy ghost. Those men that have the
spirit of this world: do falsely cry father father. They do falsely say to
Christ lord lord / whose spirit they do want. Romans viii.
For who so ever has not the spirit of Christ: yt man is none of Christ's.
And likewise as the holy ghost is that ineffable bond or knotte: by which
the three persons are inseparable joined among them selves each to other with
eternal co^corde: even so the same spirit with an vnlowseable bond does
join the spousesse of Christ to her spouse / and also does couple and knytte
to gether all the me^bres of Cristes mystical body with a perpetull bond of
love among themselves / every one with other. DIS. if the holy ghost does
proceed of the substance of god the father and of the sone / what does let /
that he may not be called sone? MAGI. Saint Cyprian / hilary / and Augustine /
thought it sufficient to answer / in this wise to this question / because
the scripture does call the second person sone / and says that he is
begotten and borne of the father / but it does in no place say / neither that
the holy ghost is begotten or borne: neither does it call him any where
sone. This answer / which so e^cellente men thought sufficient: it is
conueniente and mete forth to be contented withal / if out of two fountaynes
or sprynges one ryu^^ did issue: that river might well be said to come forth
or to be sent from both those said springes / but yet should it be called
the sone of neither nouther of them both. DIS. Is it sufficient than / to
believe this yt you have taught me as touching to the holy ghost? MAG. No
verily / but you must also believe / yt this spirit which was a fore said of
the prophets / and promised of Christ / did on whitsonday come down upon the
Apostles and Disciples so as saint Luke reherseth: Actuum. ii.
because of the wicked and blasphemouse arrogance of certain persons / which
have not ben afraid to say / I am that comforter / whom Christ promised to
you / Joan. xiiii.
for to lead you in to all verite and truth whether he were Maniche / or
whether he were Basillides / or Montane / or any other of those execrable
names. DIS. Acts. ii. Actuum. viii^
That / which came down upon the disciples and which was given to them that
were baptized / by layeng on of the Apostles hands / whether was it the very
substance of the holy ghost? A question notable.
orels was it some gift and efficacy of the holy ghost? Answer.
MAG. It is more prouable and lykely / that the holy spirit / which as
touching to his divine nature fyllyng all things does continue and abide
vncomprehended: was there after a certain special and peculiare manner / under
a visible sign / as touching to the propretie of his person. But to
entremedle with these matters now at this time: is (as it is wont to be said
in the proverb) to lepe over the hedge / and pass beyond the bounds. Thou
haste now gotteu knowledge of the spirit / that sanctifies all things: now
harken somewhat of the church / that is sancti^ied of the said spirit. DIS.
if there have been a society and fellowship of all holy men from the
beginning of the world / and if that all godly men have had the holy ghost
present with the^ why was there no name to this secret society before the time
of the law? For after the law given / it was called the synagoge / and after
the Gospel given / the name being changed / it was called the church. MAG.
what name it had before the old law given: it is not evidently known of us
/ but yet that it had some name: is very prouable and lykelye / seeing that
the thing was all one. Christ has at all times known and acknowledged his
spousesse / neither has she at any time wanted the spirit of Christ. The
church stood in a very few persons at the beginning.
But in the beginning likewise as few men had knowledge of the dystynction of
the persons / but they did profess one god (which speech does comprehend
secretly and closelye three persons) and few men did know the person of the
sone / and fewer did know the holy ghost: even so was this socyete or
felowshyppe among a few persons / and it was coarcted and contained within
narowe meares or bowndes / even until the light of the gospel came. But after
that Christ (the nature of man taken upon him) was co^uersante among men / and
that after he had redeemed his spousesse with his own death and had
evidently joined her being made clean with his own blood / unto himself /
and had evidently and abu^dauntly poured forth his spirit / and after that
the grace of the gospel was plentuosly flowe^ i^ / not into one nation alone /
but into the whole world: the Apostles changed the name of the synagoge into
the name of the church. And it is not to be dowted / but that it was done by
the suggestio^ and inspiratio^ of the holy ghost. D. I long to here the cause
hereof. M. Although there where no such difference in ye words as there is:
yet did ye chau^g of the nam^ make for ye glory of the gospel. why the
Apostles changed the name of synagoge: into the name of the church or
congregation
The name of synagoge was received and co^munely used among all men for the
congregation of the Jews / which professed the law of Moses now likewise as
ye law of Moses was hateful to al other nations: eue^ so was the name of
synagoge vnpleasau^te and mislykyng to the cares of the gentiles, Mar. xvi.
Luce. xxiiii. Actuum.i.
but the apostles / wha^ they were commanded of our lord to pche the Gospel
to every creature / not only within the terms and limits of Iewry and samary
/ but eue^ unto ye uttermost parts of ye world: and also being taught by ye
holy ghost / did know / yt there should certain Jews afterward spring up or
rise / which would face about to obscure and deface the grace of the gospel and
the faith Actuum.xv.
in our lord Jesus / teaching yt there was no hope of salvation to any man
unless he were circumcised / and so by this symbol and ^s it were / by an
earnest penny given did profess the hole law of Moses: ye apostles I say
therefore would declare / that the ceremonies of ye law from the^seforth should
be abolished and put away / and would also declare the newness of grace / by
cha^ngynge the old vocabules or names / in the stead of the law calling the
gospel / that is to wit a glad tydyng / and instead of synagog now namyng
the church or congregation. The law.
For the law did thrette^ and manace ponisheme^t / exactyng of men by
co^pulsion the observation or fulfillyng of the commandments. The gospel.
The gospel by ye grace of ye spirit / and by faith in Christ Jesus / without
the works of the law / does promise eternal life / now if the stiffnes and
froward stoburnesse of the Ieues was so great / yt the apostles were scasely
able w^ much business to exclude their superstition: how much more hard thing
would it have been to do the same if instead of the church the synagoge had been
preached hearing still the old name they would have wend and supposed / that
there had i^ the thing also no whit at all ben changed. D. Is there tha^ also
i^ the words some difference and diversity? Synagoga. Ecclesia.
MA. Both words / that is to wit Synagoga and Ecclesia are Greek words and
Synagoga is said of the greek verb synagein: which signifiethe as much as
cogere.i. drive together in one Ecclesia is said of the greek verb Ekkalein:
Ecclesia.
which signifies as much as euocare to call out or to call forth. The
formore word therefore / that is to wit synagoga is more mete and agreynge to
the gross / Synagoga.
carnal / hard / and stoburne rebellyouse nation of the Ieues which with
fear of ponishemente / or with hope of ^arthely co^modites: were kept in / or
holden back by the law as it were within hedges or rayles / that they should
not ru^ne or fall into all wickedness and sin. And the latt^rmore word /
that is to wit Ecclesia is more mete and conueniente to the Gentiles:
Ecclesia. Church.
which did lightely and easily obey the gospel / being allured by their
ears / which thing belongs to men: and not drawn by the nosethri^les /
after the manner of bugles or other brute beasts.

A flock of beasts is gatherd together: but men are called forth into an
assemble / not to work according to the ceremonies of the law: Romans x.

The obedience of the gentiles.


but to give ear and herke^. For faith (as says saint Paul) is by hearing.
The Gentiles were called forth from dead idols / to the living god / from
the darkness of ignorance / to the light of the Euangelycall verite or
truth: and they did obaye and follow. The obstinacy of the Jews.
The Jews were likewise called out from ceremonies / to true holiness / from
shadows / to light / from the lettre / to the spirit: and they did refuse to
come. And therefore it is come to pass that among the Goths and Uandales the
name of the lord is called on and worshypped: and on the other side the Jews
do contray wise even until this day revile and blaspheme the worshypfull name
of Jesus in their synagoges / and do yet serve the lettre / and do resist the
holy ghost. But where the spirit is: there is liberty. It belongs to
servants to be compelled: but it appertains to sons to be called forth
wherefore saint Paul also is wont to name those that profess the grace of the
gospel vocatos sanctos (that is to say) saints cal^led / or saints by
vocation and calling. DIS. What does this word Sanctus proprely / declare and
signify to latyne men? The significations of this word sanctus holy.
MAGT. That thing is proprely called Sanctum which it is not lawful to
violate defyle or break. As the laws / and the walls / and the yates of a
city are therefore Scta^ (id est) holy or inviolable: because they are publyke
or common. And certain things are therefore sancta that is to say inuiolat
because they are sacred and dedicated to god / wherefore that thing is called
sanctum domino (id est) holy to the lord: which is sacred or dedicated to
him. But the use of this word is otherwhiles translated to sygnyfie also
clennes and purite. Now the holy church is so inviolable and not able to be
hurt: Math. xvi.
that (according to the saying of our lord) not the very yates of hell can
prevail against it. For none other cause is it inviolable: but only because
it is dedycated and sacred to Christ / Joan. x.
From whom no man is able to pluck away that / which his father has given
him The church is also pure and clean: Ephe. v.
because Christ has Purified he and mad her clean with his own blood that
he would make her a spousesse to him self having neither spotte neither
wrincle. By Spots is betokened heresies and ^rroures.
This word spotte pertayneth proprely to heretykes / which go about to defyle
and make foul the pure verite: with sprinklyng to of filthy erroures. This word
wryncle appertains to them / which in deed do believe right: wryncles do
signify uyces and sy^nes.
but yet do led a life defiled with the filthe of vices and sins. Wryncles
do betoken age. Such one verily is that old man / which we have received of
Adam / and whom Paul does bydde us to do Ephe. iiii.
of / and to lay from us with all the acts deeds that do belong to him /
that we might do on us the new man / and being renewed in ye senses of our
mind / we might follow the steps of Christ and walk in newnes of life.
Roma.vi.

Christ is a delicate lover


Christ is a delicate and a deynty lover / he can not find in his heart to
love the synagoge being wrincled with old ceremonies and with the love and
exercise of the old law. Neither can he suffer or abide the churches of
heretics being disfigured and made foul and euylfauoured with the leprie and
diverse spots of false doctrines and erroures. D. If the old sayng be true /
that no man lives fautles and without sin: where is than that spousesse /
which in the canticles is praised / and is said Cantic. iiii.

Tota pulcra ^s amica m^a et macula uon est in t^.


to be all fair and beautyfull and without all manner spotte or wemme?
MAGISTER. It is granted to very few men to live without the lyghter / or
smaller vices or venial sins which by rechelesnes and ouersyght do crepe
and stele upon the nature of man. But these small faughtes / are rather small
speckes: tha^ great spots / and likewise as they do daily spring or rise:
eue^ so be they daily washed away either with prayer / or with deeds of
almoyse / or with the recompense and satisfaction of some good work / and
specially and principally with the receiuinge of the body of our lord / but
from great sins or deadlye crimes / they which have professed Christ / both
owghte / and also may abstain / with the help and aid of the spirit of
Christ. DIS. Do not they than / which are defiled with great sins or crimes
appertain and belong to holy church? MAG. They do belong / and they do not
belong. How great Sinners are of the church and how not.
In so much / and as farreforthe as faith does remain hole in them: they do
belong to the church / neither are they kept from the communion and
partetakynge of the sacraments / except it be so / that for some euidente
enormite of crimes they be by the publyke and open judgment cut away from
the company and fellowship of the churhe. what is the church in his most
propre significacion.
But because this word Ecclesia id est Church said in his most propre
signification does betoken the preuy or secret society and feloweshyp of them
that are predestined to eternal life / of the which company a great part
lives already with Christ / and ye other part that remains alive in this
world is called for this entente and purpose / that they should labor and
endeavor themselffes unto most high and perfyghte purite: therefore is it well
said / that the church has no spot or wrincle / How the church has neither
spot n^ wryncle.
either by the figure synecdoche / (that is to wit / saying that of the
whole / which is verified of the part) orels for cause of the mark or end
intended / of which end the logicions also do confess and grant a
denominacion or name to be taken. But yet otherwhiles this word or name church
is so dilated and stretched out so far: that it does comprehend and
contain as many as have received the sacrament of baptism / whether they do
live vertuosly or other wise. Sometime the ministers or judges of the church
are called the church / to whom we ought to obaye / allthoughe they do
openly and in syghte live an evil life: as long as it is so / that they do
not command or teach such things / as are contrary to gods law / and
may not stand with his commandments / namely if there should follow more
trouble and unquietness of the taking away to the commune weal of such
things / than of the tole ratyng and suffryng of them. There are also
Psalm.xxv.
churches or co^gregacions of wicked men / which the spouse does hate. But
whosoever professes the holy church: does execrate and abjure all
schismatic conspiration against the tranquillite of the ecclesiastical
hierarchy / likewise all conuenticles and assemblees of heretics / with
whatsoever gloriouse title they ^o set them selves forth to the sale / for
they are innumerable: but the dove is but only one. Cantic. ii.
D. In the old time the heretics also had churches / in such state of
things / when every one of them does cry Christ is not there / but here is
Christ: Marc. xiii.
by what mark or token may we discern and know that only dove of Christ
from other? M. That / which does swerve and go awrye from the holy scriptures:
is none of Christ's. D. But heretics do even with the very weapons of
scripture oppugn and fight against the church. M. And no marvel of it /
for they do follow that disceiuynge spirit / which did Mat. iii^^
assail and temple the lord himself also unto wickedness / with the
testimonies of scripture wrested and wrenched to a wrong sense / but the false
interpretation of scriptures is to be confuted and disproued and put by with
the true interpretation and declaration of ye same. D. In deed it was no
maystry for Christ to do so: but it is not likewise so easy a thing for us
wretched men to do the same. M. It is not a part belongyng and fit for every
man / to fight or dispute with heretics: but it appertains only to them /
which are instructed and well appointed with that hole armure / which the
apostle Paul does Ephe. vi.
in certain places otherwhiles reherce and reckon up: but to the / and to
such other as thou art / it is sufficient to keep and hold fast by
steadfast and sure beleffe those things / which the church has expressly and
openly taught for things necessary unto salvation. D. What shall he do /
which has received baptism / and has taken instruction of beleffe / in the
church or congregation of heretics? MAG. Let him not change the baptism /
which he has received in the name of the father and the sone and the holy
ghost: but let him purge and cleanse his doctrine / let him withdraw himself
from unclean co^gregations or assemblees / and let him reconcile himself to
the holy church DI. But that is it / which I desiered to know of you by what
toke^ or mark the holy church may be discerned and known from other. MAG.
How / or by what tokens the true Catholic church may be known from other.
There are many conjectures and gesses by which gatherd together i^ one it is
easily and son perceived and espied where the douue is. The first is the
authorite of the old Synodes / namely approved and allowed by the perpetual
and co^tynuall co^sente and agreme^te of so many sundry ages / or times / and
of so many diverse nations / next afther this is ye authorite of the
interpretoures or expositoures / How the old holy expositours of the
scripture are allowed of the church and how their works are to be read.
whom for their holiness the church has canonized / and whose books the same
church has approved and allowed not so y^ it is not lawful in some points to
dissente and disagree from them (for their selves do sometimes disagree not
only one of them from another / but also do vary from their own selves) but
that their books are to be red with reverence. And that which they do teach
not rashely and indiscreetly to be rejected and refused. The same (I suppose)
is to be thought and judged of the good and approved companyes of divines /
whose co^tynuall labor and study is to find out / and to bring forth to
us the secret and hid truth / out of the divine scriptures. Thyrdly the
bredthe or largeness is to be considered / for never has any heresy spredde
so large / as has the Catholic doctrine. Last of all the manner of living is
to be well advised / and some what nere looked on. DI. But heretics also have
Christ much in their mouths / and speak much of him. Maniches.
And also the Manicheis are reported and said to have been of wonderful
abstinence and also continency / the Ebionites do despise and set at naught
riches. Ebionite. Psalliani or Euchite, Anthropomorphite.
The Psallianes do pray contynually without ceassynge. The Antropomorphites
did live in deserte / and wilderness / they were couerde and cladde in course
he^pen clothes they ponished and kept under their flesh with fastings /

flocked together / do ^rye here is Christ: Math. xxiiii.
should not a man (and not with good cause) as it were one standing in a
place where many ways do mete / doubt and be in a mamerynge / which way he
may take / and whether he may go? MAG. ye moreover the very theater of the
gospel does show unto the Phariseis worshypfull Math. xxiii. Math. vii.
Math. xxiii Math. vi.
with their Philateries set out at large made thynne and bare with fastings /
making long prayers / dealyng forth their goods in almoyse to poor folks
But these outward things / though they have the apperaunce and likeness of
godliness and virtue: yet are they oftentimes feigned for cause of some
temporal and transytorie profighte or commodite / namely of lucre / or glory
and praise / and that made me add here before / that their life should be
looked on some what nere: which thing if any man will do / he shall find and
perceive / yt the same things are done in deed both of good men and also of
evil men / but after a diverse manner and a sundry fashion. The difference
between the outward works of good me^ and of evil men, being all one in
apperau^ce.
Good and vertuose men in their abstinences and fastes are cherefull: the other
sort are sad / heavy / and out of al chere / neither do vertuose men make
their auaun^e or boste of these things: but raither do keep these things
secret / neither do they auaunce and magnify these things as great and high
things: but do make light of them / and do ertenuate them / neither do they
despise and disdain other men / which do not the same things: Godly and
charitable men do judge all things to the best.
but they do benignely and charitably interpret and judge either that they
would do greatter things if the weyknesse feblenesse of thyer body would give
them leave: orels that they have their flesh less rebelliose to the spirit /
so that they have no need to tame it with such manner means: orels that they
do with other good deeds offer to god a more plesaunte sacrifice and oblation.
The religion and holiness of godly men / is simple: and without craft or
disceite. The disciples of Ioha^ did fast: Luce. v. Math. ix.
but they did backbyte the disciples of Christ and spoke evil of them: for
that they did more seldom fast. Manichei.
The Manicheis did abstayn and forbear from all manner beasts or sensible
creatures: but they did disprayse and co^dempne the creature of god: and
secretly and in corns did fyl themselves with delycyouse meattes both more
daynty and also more costly. Phariseis. Math. vi. Math. xxiii,
The Pharyseis did pray: but they did it in the hedes of many ways / where
they might be most seen / in their chaumbres / either they did occupy
themselves about tri^les / orels did count and tell monaye.

Psallianes.

pretense they did live of other me^nes cost and charge / and did not

Labor with their own hands / to get where of they might both find
therselues their necessaries / and also might give somewhat to poor folks.
The Ebionites had nothing several or in propre / and they were falsely called
apostolici.i. folowers of the apostles: Ebionite or Apostolici.
but they did condemn and disprayse other^ that were possessioners / and had
ought of their own / chalengynge proudly and presumptuosly to themselves the
praise of godliness and true virtue or holiness: which stondeth not in
lands or in monay / but in the affections. Holiness sto^deth in the
affections.

The very per fight holyne. of the Apostles.


They Apostles did spend their owneselues whole and altogether / to the end
that they might allure and bring very many unto Chrste neither could they by
any injuries or displesures be compelled and caused to lay away this affection
to wards any man. They purposed not / nor went about to do vengeance to any
man: but when they were cast into prison / they did sing psalms / and gave
thanks Acts. v.

stones / they were glad and rejoiced Acts. vii.

/ but professyng themselves to be naught else but mortal men: Acts. xiii^.
they did ascribe and refer all the whole praise unto god. who so ever does
fulfill and show in very deed this charity / and this patience continually
with cherefullnesse: Acts. iii.

DIS. I here say / that uneath there is any one of the old writers Math. xii.
or authors / in whom there are not found some things dissonante and
disagreynge from the rule of the catholyke faith: why than that the church
received and allowed their books? MAG. How the church has allowed the books of
the old fathers to be read
The church has admytted and received their books not as canonycal scripture /
that is to say scripture of undoubted and sure auctorite not able to be
disproued: but they are received as the commentaries and works of men being
both learned and also good and vertuose / neither Every manner error makes
not an heretyke^
does every manner error make a man forthwith an heretyke / and in the old
time those that did expoune and declare the scripture / were pardoned and hold
excused / if they did doubt of certain things / of which it is not lawful to
dout any longer after the sentence of the church publyshed and openly
pronounced / or else if they did interpretate and expoune any thing i^ the
scriptures / otherwy^e than the authorite of the church does teach now. For
neither were all the Greeks / Heretykes / which did profess that the holy
ghost did proceed / and come forth from the father alone: nor no more
peradventure was Origin Origin.
neither an heretyke therefore because that of desire to search out the troth /
he did dispute whether the son and the holy ghost had all one / and the same
divine essence with the father / or else were creatures more excellent than all
other creatures. It was lawful also more than.CCC. years after the incarnation
of Christ / to doubt whether there were any clensynge fire or fire purgatory:
which certain men did judge to be charity. But it is a very point of an
heretyke / proudly and obstinatly to rebel and strive against the euydent
veryte or troth / and which has been taught with the publyke and commune
authorite. DIS. The name of canonycall scripture / how many books does it
comprehend and contain? The books of the canonical scripture.
MAG. This thing has sayncte Cipriane very plainly and brefly taught. First
the hole scripture is diuyded into two parts / that is to wit / the old
testament / and the new. The books of the old testament.

Genesis. Exodus. Leuiticus. Numeri. Deuteronomium. Iosue. Iudicum. Ruth.
Regum. iiii.


In the old testament are accounted and rekened the five books of Moses /
that is to wit / Genesis / Exodus / Leuiticus / Numeri / Deuteronomiu^ / also
the.ii. books of Jesus Naue / of Judges / and of Ruth. Besides these / the four
books of kings / which the Hebrews do make but only two books / furthermore
the book Paralipomenon Paralipome^^^^.
/ that is to say / of things ouerhipped or left out / which of the Hebrews
is called the book of Days or times. Than the.ii. first books of Esdre which
the bebrues do recke^ both / but for one / for the third and the.iiii. book of
Esdre are accounted among the Apocriphe scriptures. Esdre. ii.
Next after these are the.iiii. principal or greater Prophets Esaias /
Iheremias / Ezechiel / and Daniel. Esaie / Iheremie / Ezechiel Daniel.
To these is added one book of the.xii. smaller Prophets. The.xii. smaller
prophets Job / psalms proverbs / Ecclesiastes / Ca^ticum ca^ticorum.
Besides this one book of Job / and one book of the psalms.iii. books of
Solomon / that is to wit / the book of Proverbs / Ecclesiastes and Canticum
canticorum / within this nombre / the Authorite of old men did conclude the
wolumes or books of the old testamente being of truth whereof it was not
lawful to dout: but now the book also of Sapience Sapience.
is received into the use of the church (which certain men do judge to be
the book of Philo a Jew) and another book which is called Ecclesiasticus
Ecclesiasticus
(which men do think to be the book of Jesus the son of Sirach) there is
received also the book of Tobie / and the book of Judith / and the book of
Hester / and the two books of the Machabeis. Thobie / Judith / Hester /
Machabeis.
There are received also the two Histories which are annexed to the book of
Daniel / that is to wit / the history of Susanna / and the history of Bell and
the dragon / which histories the Hebrews had not: but saint Iherome
witnesses that hymsel^e did translate them out of the edition of Theodotio.
But whether the church has received these books with the same authorite with
the which they have received the other books aforerehersed: that knows the
spirit of the church. Under the ^ytle and name of the new testament the
cheffe and principal place have the.iiii. Gospelles of Mathue / Mark / Luke /
and Johan / and with these the Acts of the Apostles. The books of the new
testamente.

Mathue. Mark Luke Johan / Acts Epistles.

Paul.xiiii. Peter. ii James. i. I^de. i. Johan. iii. A^ocalipie.

The hebrews ^ake but.iii. kind of scri^ture.

Canonica.


Next to these are the Epistles of the Apostles.xiiii. of sayn^e Paul's. Two
of Peter's. One of James the Apostle. One of Jude. Three of Johan. And last of
all in order is the Apocalipse of saint Johan. The Hebrews do divide all
scipture into.iii. kinds or sorts. The canonical scripture / they call that
scripture / which without any controversy or doubt was written by the
inspiration of the holy ghost / in which if any thing be found / which
seems at the first syghte folyshe / unmeet / and against reason: it is not
lawful to judge that which is written / but the mystery is religyously and
devoutly to be serched forth / and the dullness or slownesse of our wit is
to be found faughte with all / and not the scripture. Hagiographa.
Another sort of scripture they do call hagiographam / as written by holy men of
holy things. This manner scriptures they did so far forth esteem and regard:
that they were in deed reverently red in the congregations or assemblees / but
not that the authoryte of them should constrayne / or compel in matters
earnest and of wayghte. Apocripha.
Apocriphe scriptures they called such as it was lawful for every man to
read at home / according to his own mind and pleasure: but in open or comen
assemblees they should not be recyted or read / nor any man be strayned with
the auctorite of them / neither is every scripture forthwith canonical: which
is red or songen in the churches: and would god that it were among all men
observed and kept / which was decreed in the counsel holden at Carthago / that
nothing at all should be recited or read in the churches sa^e only the
canonical scripture / the interpretation and declaration / whereof was done in
the old time of prestes and byshopes by word of mouth. The decr^e made in
the counsel of Carthage concerning what things should be red in the churches.
DISCIPLE. Now a days we are kept and put away from the redynge of the holy
scripture.

MAGISTER.

But this thing was in the old time a point of most great and highest
relygio^ and holiness. But the vndyscretnes and presumption of the reders caused
and brought to pass / that it was needful to show a staff / who so ever
redeth the scriptures reverently / honourynge that thing / which he does not
understand or attain the knowledge of. How the holy scriptures are to be red,
and for what intent.
And who so ever is so much the more glad to learn of a connyng man / for
that he is somewhat prepayred before by redyng and who so ever redeth / not to
the intent for to be armed / and made ready to contention of stryuyng / but to
take some what thereof / whereby he may be instructed to live holyly and
virtuously / that constitution stryketh not him / nor appertyneth any whyt to
such a reder / which constitution was ordained and set against temerite and
indiscreet presumption / and not against the love and exercise of virtue and
godliness. DIS. In as much as of both testamentes there is all one and the
same god the father / the same Christ / the same holy ghost: why is the one
called the new testamente / and the other the old testamente? for divine or
godly things know not of any age or elderlynesse. Why the one is called the
old / and the other the new testament
MAG. The godhed (as thou sayste) knows neither oldenesse or age neither
newness / but it was expediente for us / that certain points should be newed
and changed in the exterioure and outward things / Christ consecratyng bread
and wine / called it the new testamente. Math. xxvi. what things are in the
new law: changed from the old.
Now if thou do ask of me what things are newed or changed: I could reckon
up very many things. First instead of the shadows of the law: is succeeded
and common in place the euidente and open verite / and that thing / which the
law did promise by dark rydles and figures: has been performed / and showed
forth to the bodyly senses of men. ii. Cor. iii.
The sleynge lettre has been opened or disclosed: and the quickenynge spirit
has appeared. Furthermore the outward ceremonies have certain of the^ ben
utterly and clean taken away: and certain of them ben changed into another
more me^e and convenient thing. The Judicial choice of meats is quyte and
clean taken away / we may lawfully wear garments of lynsayewolsaye / we
Deute. xxii.
may plow or till the ground Deute. xxii.
with Ox and Ass / because I will not reherce other things innumerable. Instead of so many diverse kinds of hosts and sacrifices: we have but only
one mystical host or sacrifice. Instead of the only temple of Iherusale^
(for ^^ was not lawful to make sacrifice onywhere else) we have a church
spredde through out the whole world / in which Malach. i. i. Timoth
is now offered a clean sacrifice / and pure hands are lifted up in every place
/ and in the stead of iniuriouse and paynful circumcision is brought in the
easy bathe of babtyme. The Sabbote day is changed into the Sunday. In the
stead of Moses the seruau^te of god is succeeded Christ the sone of god. The
grace of the spirit / which before was dispensed and dealed unto a few
persons / and scracely: has now ben openly and plentuosly powered out upon al
nations / which are under the sky. Finally / heaven / which before was shyt
even to godly men also: is set open by the gospel. For these things and
many other that are newed and changed: it is well called the new testamente /
not for that it is utterly another testamente than was before: but for that it
is otherwise given or taught. The Jews: Jews of the old time, in the new
testament christen men of these days, in the old testament
such of the^ as through hope of the heavenly life did live in the alacrite and
cherefulnes of the spirit: were in the new testamente. Again those men now
a days / which do measure and judge holiness by outward ceremonies / and which
do gape gredily after earthly things / being cold in charity / and hot to
do vengeance: such persons (I say) do even yet cleue and continue still in
the old testamente / for that they have not yet done of / nor laid from
themselves the old man. DIS. All these things hitherto for sothe are spoken
of you very plainly and clearly. MA. We are comen now to the holy church / in
which we do worship the father / the maker of all things / the son / the
redemer of the world / and the holy ghost / the sanctifier of all things. Let
us continue and abide in this church. And in this church let us walk
according to the spirit / and not according to the flesh.

In this church let us war a good war and fight a good field: i. Timot.
vi. ii. Timo. iiii.
that we may come unto the wage and reward of the eternal life. But if thou
think it best: let here be an end of this communication.

The fyfth instruction.
DISCIPLE. WHat means it / that to the church is annexed and added the
communion of saynctes? MAG. This particle Sanctoru^ co^munionem.
Sanctoru^ communionem is not added in sayncte Cipriane neither in sayncte
Augustine / neither do they so much as by occasion make any mention of these
words / wherefore it is very lykely / that this particle has been added of some
man / which went about to declare / what thing was to be vnderstonden by
the holy church. Ecclesia.
Ecclesia / that is to say / the church / is a societe / fellowship / or
company not of all manner men / but of holy men or saints likewise as this
word concio Concio.
to latyne men does signify and betoken an assemblee or congregation / not of
what so ever manner men you list: but of the citizens all of one commune weal
/ assembled and gathered to gether in one to take counsayll concerning the
commune profytes. And as for the diuynes of later time / among ^home some do
interpret The divines of later time do diversely expound sanctorum co^munionem.
the holy ^hurche to be the society of men milytau^te and warryng in earth
under Christ their captain and The divines of later time do diversely
expound sanctorum co^munionem.
the communion of saynctes to be the society of saynctes triumphynge in heaven
/ and other some again d^o expound by The divines of later time do diversely

sanctorum communione^ the suffrages of the church profitable and auaylable to
all men / which are in the body of the church. Other some do expound it to
signifye the sacraments of the church / which do not profit / but only to
those / which do aggregate and join themselves to the church. Other some
again do think by the name of Synaxis.
communion to be betokened the sacrament of the autre / which of the Greeks is
called Synaxis / that is to say / a conciliation or ioynynge to gether / for
that by this mystery is figured and confirmed the most straight coniunctio^
or ioynyng to gether of the mystical body with the head / and such a
mystical society or fellowship of all them that do truly profess the name
of Christ / as is the natural society of all / the members / among them
selves each with other in the body of one and the same living sensible
creature. Those divines I say which have ymagined and devised these things in
deed they do speak things that are true / but verily in my iuggement they do
not express that / which is proprely declared by these words: save only yt in
the name of holy church all these things are covertly and secretly
comprehended. But this thing is true without controuersye or doubt / that
there is no gifts in the catholyke church: All graces ^ gifts issuen from
the head Christ.
but they do come to it from the head / that is to wit Christ / although
diverse members have diverse offices and operations. DISCIPLE. There is not in all the world any thing that good is: but it does come from Christ. MAGISTER.
Troth it is / but we do now speak of those things / which by faith in
Christ and by the sacraments of the church do give true holiness and virtue.
For else god does give many commodytes and good gifts even to wicked men / ye
and to asses and oxen also.

DISCIPLE. If they be not of the company or fellowship of the church / which
do live wyckedly: and again we do not know surely of the most part of men /
whether they be good or evil: A notable question.
what manner a societe is that of men / which do not know each other? MAG.
Answer.
Nor we do not know any of the aungelles / although they do wait on us /
neither do thou know thine own soul / and yet of it is it long / that
thou do live / that thou do move or styrr^^ and that thou haste wit and
perceyuyng. Noman is compelled or constrained to know certainly / whether this
man o^ that man be a live membre of the church. It is sufficyent to believe /
that in the earth there is such a certain societye and fellowship of them / that
are predestined to life / which company Christ has glewed or joined to
gether with his spirit / whether they be among the Indianes / or else among
the Gaditanes / or else among the Hyperboreanes / orels among the people of
Affryke. And it may be so / that i^ the world there are some lands / other
Islands / or else dry lands / which are not yet found of maryners or
geographers: in which for all that the Christen faith is strong and quycke.
To behold the secret parts of man's heart / belongs only to god / by
reason whereof it comes to pass that the judgments of men very oftentimes
are uncertain. DIS. Why tha^ are certain men cast out from the churches? MAG.
The judgments of men are uncertain.

i. Tim. v.


There are certain manyfeste and open crimes / which (as Paul says) do goo
before unto judgment. Of these crimes men do judge / as they may / for the
conseruatio^ of the publyke order. Nota.
And yet for all that it happens otherwhyses / that the theffe which is
hanged on the galowes is fauteles / and that the judge which has condemned him
/ is worthy an haulter / and it may be also / that the person / that is
excommunicated / is in the fellowship and communion of the church / and that he
which did excommunicate him / is cut away and departed from the church. Also
it is possible / that he / which is drawn to the fire for an heretyke / is a
very pleasant sacrifyce to god / and that they which brought him to the fire
/ are worthy to be burnt. DIS. What even than also / when a man is
excommunicated and cast out of the church / for known and euydente murthere
or sacriledge^ MAG. ye verily / for i^ may be / that before that the bishop do
throw forth the lyghtenyng or sentense of excommunication against the
malefactoure / he be all ready by true contrition of heart / returned again
into the favor of almighty god. And yet this thing because it is unknown to
men: does not avail or help him any whyt. but that he shall be kept from the
entryng i^ to the church. why god would it to be unknown to men / who are
predestined and who not.
DIS. why would god have this in the mean season to be unknown who are verily
good and predestined to eternal life? MAG. Lest evil men despairyng / should
sin more hayghnously: and that good men should live more warely and mekely.
Seeing that there are even now so many and so great debates and stryues: what
manner a battle would be tha^ / if there were a manifest dyfference / whereby
the one sort might be known from the other^ Johan. xiii.
Our lord would not so much as utter or dysclose and show to his other
dysciples / who it was that should betraye him. Now for as much as it is
unknown / whom god has elected unto blessed immortalyte both they that do
stand / are careful lest they do fall / and they that are fallen and do lie
on the ground / do labor and enforce themselves to rise and get up again.
Finally those persons / which are feruente and hot in charity: do study and
give their mind to do good both to good men and evil men / to those that
are openly evil / to the intent that they should wax wise again and amend /
to those of whom they doubt whether they be good or evil: to the end that
they should be made better if they be good all ready. And albeit that charity
does here lose her office or work / yet for all that does she not lose her
reward. DIS. which are those sacraments of the church / of which you made
mention incident lie and by the way / not long ago? And what means or
signifies this word sacrament: MA. what this word sacrament does signifye.
Those men which have spoken more exactely and perfytely / do call sacramentum
an oath / or an obligacion or bond confirmed and strengthed by the coming
between of god or of religion. But our forefathers have applied and used the
said word to signify yt thing which the Greeks do call a mystery / and thou
may call it a religiouse or holy secret or priuyte.D. Why is it called a
secret or priuyter MAG. Because the commune sort of the people was secluded
and kept a part from the medlyng with those things. Albeit now a days many
things are done openly / as when the water of baptyme is consecrated and
hallowed. But these ceremonies and also the words wherewith they are done / were
hyd and kept secret from the people / and were taught among the byshopes
from one to another / to the intent that men should have the sacraments in more
reverence and worship. As soon as ever the bishop made ready and was aboutward
to consecrate the bread and the wine: it was not laufull for any lay men to
remain and abide within the grates or chauncelle. And a certain Pope of Rome
/ when he had answered somewhat to a certain byshope (as I wene of England)
demanding a certain question concerning the rytes and ceremonies of the
mysteries / he durst not put in writing the words / with which the oil is
consecrated and hallowed / lest peradventure if the lettres had been taken by
the way (which thing chau^ceth oftentimes) the secret might hap to have been
uttered and dysclosed. This cause in deed is some manner cause. But yet the more
true and more allowed cause is this. For that in the sacraments / by certain
visyble and sensyble tokens and signs: there is infused an insensyble grace
correspondente and agreynge to the exterior and outward tokens and
signs.DIS. How many sacraments be there of this sort and kind? M. Of the
old fathers they are taught unto us to be.vii. in nombre / The.vii.
sacraments.
that is to wit / matrimony or wedlock / i. wedlock.
by which we are borne to this world. ii. Baptyme.
Baptyme / by which we are borne again to Christ / to which sacrament is
joined. Penance / iii. Penance.
which is as it were another baptyme / by which we are reconcyled to god / but
not now freely and all out for naught / neither are the wounds healed without
stars. iiii. Confi^mation.
Holy anoyntyng / by which the young christen soldyer is confirmed and
strengthed against the temptations of the dyuell with this sacrament were they
wont to be fenced or armed / which were of age inclynyng and leaning
toward the ieoperdye and pareyll of synnynge / that is to wit after they
were seven years old. They were ^ old times. vii. years old, before they were
confirmed.
A none after as waxyng young men / they were roborated and made strong unto
great batayles with the sacrament of the aultare v. sacrament of the aultre.
by which is quyckened and styrred up in us the virtue and lyuelynes of faith
/ and we are through the commemoratio^ of that holy and blessed death / enryched
with plenteouse grace: renewynge in a mystical manner (as far forth as is
lawful / that only sacrifice / by which we have obtained salvation. Again
because in the time of death is the last wrestlynge: vi. Extreme ^^ction.
therefore is put to the extreme or last v^ction / by which either the syke
man may recover his health / if it so please god / or else he may with faith and
good hope sleep in the lord / with these / as it were with rewards or gifts
the large benignite and liberalyte of Jesus does in the mean season comfort /
and encorage and harten his soldyers / until the time that the battle or
strife being fully ended / they may be promoted to the stypende or wage of the
heavenly life. vii. Holy order.
There rests or remains behind holy order / by which is given auctorite
to bear holy offices / and to mynister holy things. This sacrament makes for
the dignite and also the tranquillyte of the ecclesyasticall hierarchy / for
it is semely and according that in the christen common weal the
ecclesyastical offices should not be assygned and appointed to any manner men /
what so ever they be / but that certain able and mete persons therefore should
be chosen and pyked out to execute them / neither can there be any concord /
where no man does obey another / but every man does claim and challenge unto
his own flesh auctorite to do what he list. Roma. xii.

i. Cor. xii.


For sayncte Paul among the gifts of the holy ghost / does reckon the gift
of governance.

DIS. what grace is given by every one of the sacraments? By the sacr^mentes
are graces given as is here particularly declared of each one of them. wedlock.

Ephe. v.


MAG. If any man shall receive these sacraments so as they ought to be
received in due manner: by the sacrament of matrimonye / the prayer of the
priest being put to / is given the gift of the spirit / by which the
husbonde may love the wife with chaste love / likewise as Christ loved the
church / and that the woman again of her part may love and reverence her
husbonde as her lord / for Christ's sake / and that both of them may teach
/ and bring up their children (if it please god to send them any) with very
great dilygence in the christen faith and virtuous life. Baptyme.
Of baptyme it is no need to speak. There is no man but he knows that in yt
sacrament Romans vi.
the old man does perysh / all sin being utterly destroyed and killed / whether
you call it original or personal sin / and that a new man does rise being
purged and cleansed from all spots of sins through faith in Christ Jesus /
whom Paul calls a new creature. Gala. vi.

ii. Cor. v.


It was mete and convenient / that he which was ones borne again in Christ /
and cleansed with the blood of Christ: should not return ii. Pet. ii.

Prouer. xxvi


again in to the soil of mire and durte: but for as much as in many men
charity is cold and faith is faynte the goodness of god has granted the
remedy of penance / Penance.
of which we shall a none have occasion and mete place to speak. Co^firmatio^.
And because young tender age is more inclynynge and ready to vice and
vnthryftynes than to virtue and godlynes / by holy confirmation that proclyuyte
is minyshed and docilite or aptenes unto virtue is encreaced and augmented /
that it should not be infected with vices / before that it does plainly know /
what vice is. Furthermore / because after the age of.xvi. years the dyuell does
lay all his ordenaunce / and use all his engynes against the soldyer of
Christ. First of fleshely lust / of glotonye / and other pleasures / tha^
afterward of ambition and wrath. Sacrament^ of the altar.
He is than oftentimes among refreshed with strong meat / and with heavenly
drink / that he may be able with a strong and bold breast to receive all the
assaults of the dyuell / bearyng Christ himself and his spirit in his
breast. In the old time infa^tes received the sacrament of the auter,
forthwith after their baptyme.
In the old time / they gave the body and blood of the lord even unto young
infantes / forthwith after their baptyme. That custom is changed / and
peradventure it were expedient / that also the custom of certain regio^s were
changed / in which confirmation is given to infantes. For as much as these two
sacraments are not of absolute necessyte / so as baptyme is. And therefore the
mothers do well to make haste unto the sacrament of baptyme: but those other
two are given more conveniently in their mete time / and they are given more
profytably: if to the sacrament be added also some little admonition or
counsayll. Holy order
And to those which are chosen out to the mystical offices / by the sacrament
of order is augmented and encreaced the gift of the holy ghost / to
admynistre and execute worthily and accordyngly the office assygned and put
unto them. Likewise as we read / that ^ctes. xiii.
the hands of the Apostles were laid on Paul and Barnabas / that they might go
forth to the spredynge abroad of the gospel. i. Timot. iiii.
And upon Timothe hands was put on by the prestes / as saynct Paul wy^nesseth
writing to him. This much to have touched somewhat by the way / concerning
the sacraments / it is sufficient at this time. It follows in the Creed. The
remission or forgeuenes of sins. Noman dare enter into the kings court being
ragged and spryncled with mire and durte: much less than it is convenient that
any man should enter into holy church / being defiled with sins. And therefore
forth with at the very threshold and first entrye of the church is given a
bath / that he may enter in pure and clean / which thing even in the old time
was observed and kept by an outward ryte and ceremonye / for the sexten of the
church standing before the church door / did sprincle and cast holy water upon
them that entered in to the church. And the old doctoures do refer this
article unto the grace of baptism / by which all sins are freely forgeuen.
And in the Creed which is songen at mass / there is mention made of baptism
and none at all of penance Confit^or ^num baptisma i^ remissionem peccat^rum.
I knowledge and confess one baptyme in to the forgeuenes of sins. In the
symbol of Athanasius there is no mention made neither of baptyme neither of
penance / for (as I have told the before) he does not expoune this part of
the symbol. The divines of more late time do very well under the name of
baptyme comprehend also penance / which should scasely have found any place
or have been received in the church / if sayncte Paul had not commanded / i.
Cor. v.
that he which had married his fathers wife / should be delivered to Satan / ii.
Corio. ii.
and anon after had commanded the same again to be received into the grace and
company of holy men. Among the people of Affrike there was granted but only
ones retournynge again into the church: The manner used in the chyrches of
Affrike.
lest the seuerite and sharpenes of the ecclesiastical disciply^e and order /
might ware fainte. And by the space of certain hundredth yers / those that
were falen into any greuouse or haynouse crime: were cast out / and kept from
entering into the church / neither were they received in again but by open
confession / and also sharp and long satisfaction and penance. Afterward
because of the frowardnes of rych men / which had lever stir and raise up a
scysme or division / than to submytte themselves to the church / the remedy
of penance was tempered and modified by the bishops / so that now the priest
only should here that thing / which before all the people was wont to here /
which priest also should remedy and heal the wounds with far more mylde
and gentle medicines. This myldenes was not only ordained to be used for cause
of the imbecillite and weakness of men / but also for the custody of simple
and innocente persons / to whom is is expedient not to know the names of many
vices. DIS. Have there ben none erroures risen about this article? MAG.
Pelagius.

Iouinianus.


Pelagius and Iouiniane did teach that infauntes neded not to be baptized /
for that (as they thought) infantes had no spotte of sin which might be
washed away / for they said that original sin was in none / save only in
Adam and Eve / but that all other men and women were borne pure and clean from
all manner sin / and therefore that in them baptyme was nothing else / but^ an
honorable sign and toke^ / by which they might be received into the adoption
of sons / and might be commended to the affections and minds of christen
men. But the erroneouse opinion of these twain the church does refuse and
condemn / following the saying of Christ in the third chapitre of Johan /
Ioannis.iii.
unless a man be borne again by water and the holy ghost / he can not enter
in the kingdom of god. And saint Paul in the third chapitour to the Romans.
Roma. iii.
All men have sinned: and do need the glory of god. Among the people of
Aphrike there sprung up certain / which did not receive them into the
communion and fellowship of the church / which had been baptized of heretics /
unless that they were baptized again of the catholyqs. And this doctrine also
has the church rejected and condemned / and has taught / according to the
saying of sayncte Paul / Ephe. iiii.
that there is but one baptyme / whereof any manner man may be a minyster / all
be it that he be an heretyke or an evil man / so that according to the mind
of the church he do baptyze by the invocation and calling on of the holy
trinite / how be it yet where as is no necessyte to the contrary / it is
conu^nie^t and according / that baptyme be given by a priest or by deacones and
it is a more sure way to wash again those which have been baptized of hethen
men or of Jews / but with this exception / if thou be not duly and in right
manner baptized I do baptize the? In the same Affryke (which according to the
proverb of the Greeks / always brings forth some new monstre) Donatiani.
spra^g up the Donatianes / which bosted that in all churches the grace of
baptyme was failed / save only in the church and congregation of themselves /
and therefore they preched openly / that baptyme did nothing avail any man /
except it were received again among them. But the church according to the
Iohon^.i.
testimony of Ihon^ Baptiste / upon whom thou shall see the holy ghost lyghtyng
and abiding upon him / this is he which baptyzed^ has taught that man is
no^^e other thing than the minyster of baptyme / and that it is Christ /
which is the true author of baptyme the virtue and strength whereof is of the
blood of Christ and the capacite and aptnes to receive it is by faith / and
that neither can it be corrupted through fault of the minister / which god does
give by faith / neither can yt grace be consumed / for as much as it is in
finite / and sufficient enough to abolyshe and put away all the sins of the
world / although there were. x. worlds far more fylthy and synnefull than
this. A fore this there were the Selencianes / which did not receive the water
of baptyme: Selenciani.
but only the baptym of the spirit. And there were some also / which did put
to / and did use the baptyme of fire: because that i^ the third of Matheu Ihon^
Baptiste does say. Math. iii.
He shall baptize you in spirit and fire: where as by the spirit he does
understand and mean the priuye or The spirit.
secret grace of faith / which only the holy ghost does infuse or power into
m^nes soul / and Fyere.
by fire he understands charity / without which faith is dead. Of all other

falsely taught that baptyme and faith are not sufficient to the obtaynyng of
health and salvation v^les circumcision were put to / whose error was
condemned of the Apostles selves / and specially of Paul: Actuum.xv. Gala. v.
so that now there is no need of any confutation Nouatus

Montanus.


thereof / Nouatus and Montanus did not receive into the company and fellowship
of the church those persons / which after their baptyme had dyshonested and
made heavy the church with some haynouse and manifest crime / not (as I wene)
for that they did take away from such manner men all hope of salvation / but
that they might beryue them the honor of the fellowship or company / to the
putting of other men in fear of doing the like / which thing sayn^t
Augustine does witness and record evidently of those persons / which after
being ones reconciled to the church by penance / had fallen again into the
same / or else into like crime and trespass. Man may shytte to man the doors of
the church: but heaven no man may shytte but only god. So in the old time
those persons / which being prestes or deacons / had committed an evident and
manifest crime / were put out of the clergy without any hope of coming in
again. The same thing was done to the byshopes. But this seuerite or
sharpness of correction also was mitigated of them that came after.
Concerning confession and satisfaction both there has been great strife in
times passed / and also now these days is renewed again. Nota
But I do think and judge it both most surest way / and also most mete to
the saving and keeping of the commune concord / with simple obedience to follow
that thing / which the auctorite of the church has taught us / that is to say
according to the proverb of the Brekes / to bow and lene toward the better
side: and to abstain and forbere from such things / whereof thou doste stand
in doubt. Now rests and is behynd the last part of the Symbol or creed. The
risyng again of the flesh. Here thou heareste the ending of the world / when
Math. xiii. Math. xxv.
good men shall be disseuered and sundred from evil men / so that the wicked and
ungodly persons shall Apo. xxi.
have no hope to have an end ones of their pain and tourmentes / neither the
good and godly persons shall have any sorrow or greffe / no nor yet have any
fear of evil / Roma. viii.
when also the very creature which does now mourn with us / shalbt delivered
and set free from all manner incommodytes or displeasures. How al things shall
^e new after the resurrection.
All things than shall be new / not by chau^gyng of their substance: but by
the reason that their qualite shall be changed. Flesh.
By the name of flesh here in this particle is understood and mente the body
of man / by Rysynge again.
rysyng again is mente reuiuyng and waryng live again. All the articles of the
Creed in very deed are to be holde^ and kept by fast and stable belefe: The
article of resurrection of all other, is most firmly to be believed.
but this article most specially of all other is firmly to be believed / which
does bring most chefly solace and comfort to good and vertuose men being in
tribulation and aduersite here in this world / and also on the other said again
does put wicked men most in fear and dread / which else would fall without
measure or end into all manner abominations and sins / if after this life
both good men and badde / should not be the one rewarded / the other ponyshed
accordingly to their deservings. This is the fundation and ground of all our
whole faith / which ought to be most strong and stable / which if it be
loose and unstable: al other things well nere are believed in vayn. Let the
wretched Sadduce^s therefore goo their way / Sadduce^.
which in so much do not believe the rysyng again of the bodies: that they do
neither Math. xxii.

Actuum.xxii^


believe that there are aungelles / no nor yet any spirits / as who should say
/ that there were nothing verily being in the nature of things / but only
that / which is open and perceyueable to the bodyly senses / from which senses
nothing is more far away / than is the very godhed. Fare well they also which
do profess / that the souls shall rise or revive again / but the bodies in
no wise: where as in very deed the soul (in as much as it is immortal) can no
more revive and ware alive again: than it can dye. But they do call it the
resurrection of souls: when they shall be called forth to bliss / out of the
secret places / in which (after their mad dreams) they had for a certain
time and season lain hid. Fare well they also / which do deny / that this
self same body / which we do bear about with us shall revive and live
again / but do say that to every man shall be given another body much more
excellent and better than this is. But we shall not be the same me^^ if we shall
not receive again the same bodies. And I pray you what need is it to create
new bodies: when god by his almighty power is able to restore these same
bodies / to most perfyght clarite and bryghtnesse / and also to blessed
immortalite? not chaungynge the substance of the body: but chaungynge the
qualites of the body into much better? Chiliaste
Fare well also the Chiliastes / which of the revelation of sayncte Ihon^
misconstrued and wrong vnderstonded / did dream / that we shall ones revive
and live again / and that by the space of a thousand years / we shall use and
enjoy plentuosly all the delicies and voluptes of this wordle. But we gyueng
credence to the words of blessed Job. Job. xix.
And I shall be coumpased again round about with mine own skin / and in mine
own flesh I shall see my god / whom even I mine own self shall see and not
another person and also herkenyng and beleuyng sayn^t Paul / which wrote in
this wise. He that has raised up Jesus: Roma. viii.
shall raise up us also with Jesus. We (I say) upon the fast credence and
belefe of these aforereherced auctorites / do reckon our self most sure and
out of doubt / that all men shall revive and live again in the end of the
world / with the same bodies / which they do bear about in earth / and that
they shall none otherwise rise again / than Christ himself did rise again /
which shall con^forme and make like our bodies to his own body glorified. The
immortalite of the bodies / shall be commune both to good men and badde men. But
to the wicked persons / immortalite shall bring or cause everlasting
tourmentes / and to the good and godly persons / it shall bring or cause
eternal joy and bliss. How be it yet it ought rayther and more truly to be
called the eternal death of wicked men: than the immortalite of them. And
therefore that particle everlasting life (which certain persons have added
and put to out of the mass creed) appertains only to the good and godly men
/ where as the word of resurrection does egally appertayn both to the good and
to the badde. How be it yet this word resurrection also is so used
otherwhyles: How this word resurrection is taken other whiles in the
scriptures.
that it does appertain only to good men / as for example wha^ our lord
says in the gospel of Ihon^ / I Johan. xi.
am resurrection and life. And Paul likewise seldom does use this word any
where / but in the good part. And our lord makes a distinction and
difference of resurrections in the.v. chapitour of Ihon^: sayng. And those /
which have done good works: shall come forth unto the resurrection of life.
Iohon^. v.
And those / that have done evil works / unto the resurrection of judgment /
for judgment here he calls condemnation. This thing is more expressly said
and spoken in the symbol of Athanasius. At whose coming all men must rise
again with their own bodies / and shall render and give account or reckenynge
of their own deeds. And those which have wrought well / shall go into eternal
life / and those that have wrought evil: shall go into eternal fire. So also
says Paul in the.vi. chapitour to the Romans. Roma. vi.
The wage or hiere of sin / is death / but eternal life is the benifyte and
gift of god by Christ Jesus our lord. He added here eternal or ever lastyng
/ because that likewise as unto those that are damned / there shall be no hope
of release / so on the other part again the godly persons shall have no
manner fear / lest their felicitye and joy might be at any time either ended /
or else minyshed the pleasauntnes and ioyfulnes / whereof shall greatly be
augmented and increased by that communion and fellowship of all holy men. For
charity / which never falls away: i. Cor. ^iii.
shall there be most feruente and hot. Now charity is no less glad of
other men's welthe and weldoynge: than of her own. Neither is there any cause
/ why we do need here to ymagine pleasures of the body which do stand i^ meat
/ drynk / or the fleshely company of man and woman for there shall be than none
use or profit of these things / but the bodies shall be spiritual / in which
we shall live as the aungelles of god done. Mat. xxii.
Now the felicite of angels is to see the face of the father which is in
heaven. And our lord says the same in the gospel of Ihon^. Io. xvii.
This is the everlasting life / that they may know the alone / which are
the very god: and Jesus Christ / whom thou have sent. That knowledge begins
here by faith. And there it shall be fynyshed and made full and perfyte / when
we shall behold and see the glory of him / his face being clearly showed and
discovered. DIS. Are these things sufficyente to the purchasyng and obtaynyng
of salvation: MAG. For the obtaynyng and gettyng of baptyme / these things are
sufficient to a lay man for to believe: but also that are learned and somewhat
grown in age / ^ught to believe all things / that are expressed in the holy
scriptures / or which are of the said scriptures evidently gathered or
concluded / besides this what so ever thing the catholyk church has with
universal and contynuall consent approved and allowed / which church / if it
have ordained or decreed any thing after such fasshyon: it was probable and
very lykely / that either it was begone of the Apostles / and so has
continued as it were given by hand from the elders to the yo^gers / orels it
was brought forth to us out of the preuye and secret storehouse of ye
scriptures / or else it has been showed and put in their minds by the
inspiration of the holy ghost accordingly as ye state of times did require.
And as touching to contentiouse and dark doctrine or opinions: in all such
things it shall be sufficient for the and such as thou art to profess with
this ware and wise circumspection. Concerning these things / I believe as the
church beleuyth. This is a more sure way and more far from all danger:
than boldly to affirm that thing / where of thou art in doubt / or which thou
do not perceive or understand. DIS. But in ^xtreme ieoperdye / whether it
is A notable question
sufficient to keep and hold fast the belefe in heart and mind / or else are
we bound also to profess with our mouth? MAG. Answer.
To this point sayncte Paul shall make answer to the for me.

With the heart (says he) we believe unto ryghtuosnes: Roma. x.
and with the mouth confession is made unto health and salvation. And our lord
himself threteneth in the gospel / Math. x. Mar. viii.
that he will not be acknowne of him for his soldyer before his father: who so
ever shall have been afraid or ashamed to profess him before men. But it is one
thing not to prof^sse / and another thing to deny. where there is no hope of
fruit or good to be done / and yet the ieoperdye is very great: it is not
necessary or requisite that thou sholdeste utter or bewray thyselfe in such
wise / as we do read that certain men have unprovoked and uncalled / even of
their own accord run forth into the market / that they might be slain and
put to death with other Christen men / or ^ls that they have raged against
the solemn festiuytes of Paganes / not for the entente that they would bring
any man to Christ: but to the end that after they were slain of them / they
might be accounted and reckened among martyrs / Christ did license or grant
to his apostles no manner violent defense of themselves / against wicked men:
but he only gave the^ leave to flee. Acts. xii. Acts. ix.
Peter fled out of prison / Paul fled out of Damask being let down by a
baskette of the walls. But so often times / as the thing shall come to such
an exigente or pynche / that the name of our lord Jesus is to be glorified both
among good men and badde men / the christen / and the hethen: than ought we
all the entycementes or pleasures / and eke the fears and displeasures of the
world utterly despised and set at naught) cherefully and boldly to profess
that / which the church has taught. Elcesaite.
The doctrine and opinion of the Elcesaites is refused and condemned / which
taught / that in the time of persecution / men might lawfully deny Christ with
words: so that they kept still the syncerite of the faith in their heart and
mind / which saying if it were true / tha^ did Peter the Apostle in vain weep
so many tears / for that he bey^ge troubled with fear of death / had denied
his lord and master thries: Math. x^vi.
when he had not yet so much spiritual knowledge of him / as the light of
the gospel has opened unto us. Tertullia^^
Tertullia^ again to much leanyng and inclynyng to the contrary part / does
not so much as grant leave to flee in persecution / saying that than to flee /
is a kind of denyinge Christ. And his saying in certain circumstancies may
be true / but doutlesse they do less offend / which stricken with worldly
fear do deny Christ only with their mouths: than do they / which for
temporal profytes sake / do forsake their captain Christ / whose sworn
soldyers they became in baptyme both with heart and also with tongue. DIS. When
tourmentes are thretened more greuouse and paynfull than any death: what shall
tha^ the frayltye of man do? MAG. what is to be done in the greatte storms of
persecution.
Our lord himself has prescribed a form and has set us an exaumple / wha^
that excedyng fear / yrkesomnes / and agonye shall come so sore upon us: we
shall acknowledge the weyknesse of our ouwe might and strength and wholly
mystrustyng our own power and aid / we shall cast our selves flat upon the
ground / and with great confidence and trust shall with weeping / desire and
call for the help of the divine power / nothing considering how greuouse or
how cruel the things be / that are manacyd or thretened to us / or how
frail our condition and state is: but considering and remembrynge / how
mighty / and how merciful the lord is / under whose defense and governance
we do fight / which is not deaf when he is called on with faith and trust /
but either does deliver from euylles / or else does add and encreace strength
to us / that we may strongly and manfully endure and suffer. Faith is
invincible in all manner bataylle.
For faith is a thing verily invincible in all kinds of batayles / for there
do not lack batayles and stryues even among christen men also / to such
persons / as do study and labonre to live godly in Jesus Christ. ii. Timo. iii.
Now who so ever done exercise themselves daily in these lyghter and smalle^
conflictes or skirmyshes: are at that battle found vnafrayde / wherefore it is
convenient and mete / that the cheffest ^ principal study of a christen
soldyer be / to quycken or stir up / and also to encreace daily the vigoure
and lyuelynes of faith. A christen ^oldyer should pryncypallye study to quy^k^^
and encreace this faith.

DISCIPLE. I Am comen again now / lokynge and longing for the last mess of

confirm each thing contaytayned in the Creed / with diverse testimonies of
both testamentes. For there is nothing taught herein / which was not many
thousand years agoo diversely shadowed by the figures of the law of Moses /
and also showed or told before by the oracles of the prophets / ye and certain
things also were evidently expressed. As for exaumple / that there are not
many gods / and that of one god this world was created / for who so ever
even before the law given / did live vertuosly and godly / did worship only
one god the creature of all the world. Math. xi.

Prophecy ended in Johan Baptiste.


Now the gift of prophecy rests and ceased in Iohon^ Baptiste / as in the
ioynynge together of both laws / whose fortune it was / that whom other
prophets as it were through a mist did show a far of for to come: him he
showed present / poyntyng him with his finger. But of all prophets the most
sure and undoubtedly true prophet was our lord to his own self /
fullfyllynge with his deeds / and declarynge that which was shadowed by the
obscure sayings and figures of of the old law / among the people / in
parables / and among his disciples sometime covertly sometime openly. His divine
nature he showed with works and deeds / rayther than expressed it with words.
And who should ever have understand / that by the brazen serpente / which was
hanged up on a stake was shadowed and figured Christ crucified: Numeri. xxi.
if our lord himself had not vouchesafed to expound and declare it? Johan.
iii. Johan. ii.
That saying of his louse you a sondre this temple / and within.iii. days I
will raise it again / was not understood not of his own disciples: until
after his resurrection. Moreover who would have demed / that Ione.ii.
Jonas which was devoured of a whale / and was cast forth again alive on the
third day did prefigure the buryal and the resurrection of Christ. Math. xii.
And when the time of his death drew somewhat nere: he gave his disciples
openly monition and knowledge before / that he should be delivered to the Gentiles
/ to be mocked / and nailed on a cross: Math. xx.
but he comfort the same again / promysinge / that he would rise again on
the third day. Johan. xxvi.
So likewise before his death / he told them somewhat darkely of his ascension:
but after his resurrection he told them again of the same more evidently.
Luce. xxiiii.
In like manner he told them before Math. xiii. Luce. xiii.
that the mustarde sede / that is to say / the faith of the gospel / from
very small begynnynges should be spredde abroad through out the whole world /
and also showed them before / Johan. xv. and xvi.
that should chance and betyde the preachers of the gospel. Math. xxi.
This thing also he told them before that the religion of the Jews should be
taken away and destroyed / and the religion of the gospel translated / and
conuayed to the Gentiles the Jews still contynuynge and remaynyng in their
dark blyndenesse / until that at mete and conu^nient time (according to the
prophecy of saynct Paul) Roma.xi.
of the Jews and Geutiles should be made one fold under the only
hedepapastour Christ. Johan. x.
Neither did he so much as hyde this from them that the church should in time
afterward to come be assailed with diverse heresies: Math. xxiiii.
but not overthrown / what need me to make many words: seeing that all
things hitherto have so chanced and comen to pass / as they were prophesied
and foresaid / to doubt now than any whyt of the last judgment / and of the
rewards of good men and of wicked men / seems to be a point of extreme
blyndenesse / we do give credence to a diuyner or sothesayer / if he have told
us.iii. or.iiii. times before the truth as it has after followed: and to him
that in so many things and so vnbeleueable after the judgment of man / has
all ways ben found true of his sayings / shall we not now give credence in
one thing that is behind? But this part / for as much as it belongs to the
Jews and Paganes more than to christian men and has also ben dilygently written
and taught of Tertullian and Ciprian: at this time I will pass over it /
being content as it were with a finger to have showed and poynted to the
fountaynes / out of which thou may draw up these things / if it please the.
Now rests behynd the admonition and cou^saylle / that we may live well and a
right according to the right faith. Faith is of a fire nature always doing.

A similitude.


Faith is a thing of a fyery nature / where so ever it is / it is not idle /
but likewise as in a laumpe the oil fedeth and norysheth the flamme / lest it
be quenched and go out / so do the works of charity feed and nouryshe faith
/ that it do not fail or dye. Faith bryngethe forth good works and is
nouryshed again of them.
Faith ge^dreth and brings forth good works / but they again of their part
do nouryshe their parente or mother. And therefore did the light fail and goo
out in the laumpes of the foolyshe virgins: because there wa^ted the oil of
good works. Math. xxv.
And all be it the rule and form of good living is wont to be fet out of all the books of holy scripture / yet for all that in this symbol or Creed / how
so ever short it is / there is contained the hole philosophy of living well
and vertuosly / neither is there any virtue / unto which it does not instruct
us / neither is there any vice / against which it does not arm or fence the
mind of man. In this short Creed is contained the whole philosophy of living
well ^ vertuosly.

i. Pet. v.


For the dyuel walks about through the fold of the church / as it were a
roryng lion sechynge whom he might devour / whom sayncte Peter byddeth us
resyste being strong and bold / not with confidence and trust of works or
of our own strength: but in faith. DIS. you have armed me with faith: now you
do charitably / when you teach a young soldyer to use his armoure. MAG. Our
lord himself taught us / that all the precepts of the law are summaryly and
generally contained in this one. Matthew. xxii.


Thou shalt love thy lord god with all thine heart / with all thy soul / and
with all thy powers: and thy neighbor as thine own self. But no man can love
god above all things: except that he do believe / that there is nothing more
beautyful or fayrer / nothing better / nothing more true / nothing more amiable
or lovely / than he. For who so ever believes that any other thing be^syde him
/ is either better / or else egall to him: that man does not believe that he is
god. He therefore that has cast himself whole upon god: can love nothing /
but that which he does love for gods sake / neither can f^are anyethynge /
but that which he fearethe for gods sake. And even forthwith with this
beginning * Credo in deum. I believe in god: are cut away / or at the least
wise are mitigated and aswaged all the desires of the flesh: to any of which
if thou do obey / despisyng and not regardyng the commandments of god / it
is euyde^t and plain / that thou make to thyselfe another god / what so ever
thing this is that thou preferreste before god. Math. vi. Luce. xiiii.
Our lord when he does call god / and mammon or riches / two lords contrary
the one the other: he does as it were compare and match two gods to gether
/ and sayncte Paul calls couetousenes / that is to say love and desire of
money / idolatrye. Ephe. v.
The same Paul notes and rebukes them / that are given to lucre of money and
to the pleasures or profy^es of the body with a slanderous report / whose
belie (says he) is their god. Philip. iii.
The same again writing to the Corinthians calls the dyuel / the god of this
world / nor for that he is in very deed a god or a lord: but for that he is
both a lord and a god to them / which despisyng the very lord god do give
them^selues to him into seruitute and bondage. And that / which has been said
of avarice and ye desire of money or riches: the same is to be thought and
judged of al vices / namely capitale and deadly. Apostasy.
Apostasy / that is to say forsakynge or going away / is a slanderous and a
rebukefull word among christen men / and not without a cause doutlesse (for
if among them / which are naught else but me^ / the name of a rebel or a run
away or traitoure be abominable: how much more shame and rebuke is it /
willingly without cause / to go away from such a capitayn to whom we are
bounden with so many sacraments / with so many gifts / so many bonds / not
unto his better / or to his egall or pere / but from the best capytayn of all /
to the very worst of al^ and the ears of al christian me^ well nere do abhor
the name of Apostata / but would god the mind of them did likewise abhor and
hate the thing self. Three manner of ordinance wherewith the dyuell go^th
about to overthrow and vaynqueshe us.
Now the dyuell for the most part fyghteth against us / and goes about to
overcome us / with three manner engynes or ordinance / that is to wit /
ignorance / hope of commodites ^ and fear of the contraryes. But pure faith
(as it has been said heretofore) puts away all darkness or blyndenesse of
the mind / but neither flattering hope does begyle / neither gastfull fear
does cause him to shrynke / or move a fo^e from his good purpose: which has
set all his whole trust in god. Faith and sure trust in god: puts by all
manner t^mtations.
How sore does it vex and trouble some men's minds the love and desyer to
know things after to come^ One man wysheth or desires long life / and
hates death / he counsayleth with astronomers and calkers of men's
natiuites. But he that does verily believe and trust in god / being careless
and without fear / says with sayncte Paul. Philip. i.
To me Christ is life: and death is advantage. Another man has a ship
frayghted or laden with costly merchaundyse / he asks counsayll of
astronomers: but the godly man says. God send this b^age to be prosperouse and
luckye ^ if he shall judge it to be expedient for me: if not: that which he
shall give me for this damage and loss: is better than all wares Another man
is payned and oppressed with sycknes: and sends for an inchaunter: the
vertuose man says. He is my lord / he is my father / let him scourge me even
as it shall please himself: so that he will acknowledge me for one of his
sons: and inheritoures of eternal felicite. Breflye that man fears but
smally / what so ever fearful thing is in this life / which does truly fear
him / that may when he is offended and displeased Math. x.
send both body and soul into hellfyre. He does but lightly and smally hope
for the commodites of this world: which does consydre and remember / that god
after this transitorye and brefe life does promise life eternal. And who is so
mad / that he will despise or proudely disdain any man: if he do considre
that himself whole is less in comparison unto that unspeakable magesty of
god than is a gnatte in comparison to an elephant? Or how can he despise that
man as vile: whom Christ no foolyshe merchaunt / has vouchesafed to ransom
and bye again with his own blood? If it be a gaye and an excellent thing /
to have the benevolence and favor of a prince: this is the prince of princes.
If it be a dau^gerouse thing to run into the displeasure and wrath of a king:
this is the king of kings and lord of all lords. Apo. xix.
Many men are sad and heuye: for that they are commen of a low and a pore
stock or kyndred: but faith comfort them again / tellyng them / that those
men are truly noble and gentlemen: whom god does acknowledge for his sons
and heirs / and of whom he is glad to be called father. Other again are
made proud and hyghmynded by the reason of their noble and worshypfull
auncesters: but faith shewethe them that there is one commune father of all
men / before whom there is no dyfference between a prince and a page / between a
poor man and a rych man / between a bond man and a free man. The more that
every man is for vertuose living accepted and in favor with him: the more
noble: the more mighty: and the more rich he is. This only lord does Christ
show unto us: whom we should worthily fear. This only father he does show
to us: whom we should love / whom without any resystence and gyueng many
words again we should obey / whom as sons / not bastard / or going out of
kind / we should countrefayte and follow. Be you (says Christ) perfyte /
likewise as your heavenly father is perfyte / Math. v.
which causes his son to rise upon both good and badde folk: and sends
down rain both upon the ryghtuose and vnrightuose Those men that have
abundaunce and plentye of the co^modites of this world / as riches: honors:
nobilite: power: beaulty: and such other things: which are wont to cause
the mind to swell and ware proud: to them their pride is anon turned into
fear / if they do consydre to what lord they are det^ers for all these
things: in whose hands and power it lies when so ever he list to take away
from unkind persons; what so ever thing he has given to kind persons: and
to whom they do know that acco^ptes must be given of every particulare thing /
and of whom they may here forthwith these words * why or whereof art thou
proud / thou that art naught / but earth and asches?

Why art thou so ioly / and make thou it so gaye with other birds feathers?
Why dareste thou despise thy neighbor as a vile caytyfe: which has the same
father / and the same lord / that thy self have? Why do thou disdain him as
a bondeman: seeing that he is redeemed and boughte with the same price / for
which thyselfe was raunsomed? Why set thou light by him and despysest him
as pore / of whom the father has care and mind / which is the lord of all
things? Were they pore men: to whom the Apostle writes. i. Cor. iii.
Al things are yours / and you are Christ's own Why doeste thou set him at
naught as pore which is ascribed and called to the inheritance of the eternal
life: as well as thyselfe / yea and which peradventure shall in this point be
preferred / and have preeminence before the? For in the gospel it is said
against rich men / of the pore men / Luc^. xvi.
that they may receive you into their everlasting tabernacles or dwelling
places. He whom thou kepeste under as a bondema^ / is thy fellow servant. He
whom thou despysest as vile borne / is thy brother / he whom thou regardest
not / as being pore and frendeles: has aungelles minystrynge and doing
service to him. Thou being proud of the palace / doste mock and skorne the
vile and homelye cotage of the poor man: but for that poor man / the common
father of you both / has builded the palace of the whole world / for his
cause do the startes shine / for his cause do the celestial spheres or circles
move and turn round / for his cause does the earth bring forth her fruits /
as well as for the. After this manner has one and the same faith caused and
brought to pass / that neither the prosperity of this world can cause us to
be wanton and proud: neither ^^uersite can make us to despair. And who so
ever does believe / that there is a god gouernynge all things: that man
believes that he is more present to each one of us / than any man is present to
himself / and that he does more exactely and perfytly see and behold the
secret corners of our heart / than we do at none days see any body being set
before our eyes: How than can it be / but that man / whether he be in darkness:
or else in light / or whether he be alone / or else with many in company / shall
with much dread and much reverence so order his works and deeds / lest there
might be any thing / that should offend and dysplease the eyes of his father
/ and lord / and also his judge? The whole world / is the temple of god.
This whole world is the temple of god / in which he sytteth as head and
ruler. If than it be so / that we are ashamed in a temple of s^one to do any
thing dishonest or unseemly / with how much more reverence and dread ought we
to occupye our self in this temple? There are diverse and sondrye darts and
weapons / wherewith that tyraunte the dyuell goes about to wound us: but
against them all this only shield is sufficient: * Credo in deum. I believe in
god. If he do stryke at ye with the darte of pride: Pride.
cast forth against him the shield I believe in god / which how greatly he
does hate proud minds / he has declared in Lucifer. If he does prycke the
with wrath to vengeance: make answer wrath.
I believe in god / which has reserved and kept to himself the auctorite and
right of doing vengeance saying. Romans xii. Deute. xxxii. Envy.
Uengeaunce or ponyshement is mine / and I will requyte / If envy does brenne
thy mind: say I believe in god / which distributeth his gifts to every man as
he list him self / why should I envy my brother and fellow servant the
liberalyte and bounty of our commune father and lord? How much more right and
reason is it that I should give thanks to my father and lord for two causes?
both for that he has given so many things to me above my deseruynge / and
also for that he does give these things to me by my brother / for what so
ever thing is given to any one of the members / that same thing is both the
vauntage / and also the anourame^t of the whole body. Avarice.
If avarice does tempte and provoke the to dysceyte and rauine or extorsion
saying / on less thou do make haste to gather goods by hook or crook /
by right or wrong, thou shall be oppressed with poverty in thine age / thy
children shall beg: make answer / I will not do it for Math. vi^ Lucc. xii.
I believe and trust in god that he the which fedeth the sparowes / which
clotheth and covers the lylyes of the feldes: shall not suffer his own
souldyer to starve and petyshe for hungre. Glotony.
If concupiscence shall provoke the to e^cesse and superfluite of meat or
drink and such other: say / god forbede that I should do this / for I trust
or believe in god / whose lyberalite and bounty has granted me these things /
not to glotony and intemperance: but to sobre and measurable use / what so ever
part hereof is bestowed upon the fullfyllyng and satisfyenge of concupiscence:
it is theft / it is rauyne / yea moreover it is sacrilege / it is idolatrye /
what so ever remained above my necessaries it was the goods of pore me^ / it
was due to the me^bres of Christ / and that it is bestowed on drunkenness and
surfeyte: is in the contempt and dyshonoure of god offered in sacrifice to
deuylles. If fleshely lust does provoke the to fornication and adultery:
Lechery.
refuse and defye it: saying. I believe in god the father / to whose eyes these
things are displesaunte. I will never do so lewedly that for so little a
pleasure I will les^ the inheritance of the heavenly joys / and the securite
and quietness of a good and clear conscience. He is a foolyshe merchaunte /
which will allow such manner exchange. If I would be ashamed to commytte any
such sin / if my earthly father were present to look on me: how much more
ought I to fear the eyes and sight of that heavenly father? Now if we do come
to Christ / which has more familiarly set forth before us the ensaumple of
vertuose and godly life: what part is there of the christian philosophy /
which we may not sufficiently learn hereof? who would not be kendled to the
love of virginite and chastity: when he hears that Christ was borne of a
virgin / which also in his own body has commended virginite to us? Who would
not be ashamed to defyle wedlock with adulteries / or in wedlock to serve the
fleshely lust: when he considers and calls to mind the wedlock of Mary
and Joseph more chaste than all virginite? The hygh^ dignite of the nature of
man.
Besides this / when he shall considre and think / that so much honor has been given to the nature of man / that it has been received to the company and
fellowship of the divine person in Christ / and that it does sytte on the
right hand of the father: should he not be afraid to cast down himself to
beastly pleasures of glotony and lecherye? The aungelles do acknowledge and do
worship the mystery / as sayncte Peter does witness in the first chapitour of
the first epistle. And therefore in the.xix. chapitoure of the Apocalipse / when
S. Johan fell down on his knese to worship the angel: the angel forbad
him saying. See that thou do not so / I am thy fellow servant / and of thy
brothern having the testimony of Jesus / but before the incarnation of Christ /
the same was not said likewise to Abraham or to Daniell: when they worshypped
an angel. In as much than as aungelles do confess and acknowledge the
dignite of the nature of man: how unworthy and how vilaynouse a deed is it /
to defowle it with the most vile fylthe of vices and sins? Why do we not
rayther harken to sayncte Peter exhorting us in this wise. ii. Pet. i.
By whom he has given to us preciouse and most great promysses / that by
reason hereof we should be made parttakers of the divine nature: if that we will
flee from the corruption / that is in the world through concupiscence and lust.
Furthermore he that with pure and whole faith does profess him to be lord and
owner: how dare he be bold to steal any part of himself from him / and give
it to the dyuell / in as much as he is whole his own / to who^e he dedicated
and gave himself whole in baptyme? He that professes him to be Jesus: why does
he seche for salvation or health of any other thing / than of him? He that
professes Christ most souerayng king and pressed: with what face does he
despise and make light of his laws? with what face does he suffer that
blessed and honorable sacrifice to be offered for himself in vayn: which Christ
would to be fruitful and helthfull to all me^? The son of god for thy love
was made man / to the intent that he would make the of a man a god / and doist
thou in despyte of him make thyselfe of a man a creature more vile and worse
than any brute beast? Beside this / what other thing is all the life / ye
death / and the resurrection of Christ than a most pure and clear myrrour or
glass of the eua^gelical philosophy. The life of Christ is the myrroure of all
virtues. Obedience.
Obedience is hyghly commended and praised / and not without good cause: this
without exception is first and principally due to god. Christ was obediente to
his father even unto death / and that ye death of the cross. Philip. i^.
Next after god it is due to ye pare^tes. Luce. ii.
He was made obedient and subject to the^: wha^ he was not perceived and
vndersto^den of the^. Some obedience also is due to them that bear any common
office / although they be evil men: he did not withdraw him self from
judgment / but Math. xxvi.
when Caiphas demanded a question of him / requyryng answer thereof in gods
behalf: he made answer / and certain aunswers Johan. xviii. and.xix. Luce.
xxiii.
he made also to Pilate. Herod he did not greatly regard to answer / for
as much as he did not there bear any commune office or authorite / but did
only for his pleasure and minds sake goo about to have gotten some miracle
wrought of him. Math. iiii.
Satan the tempter he did reiecte in all points Luce. iiii.
of the unclean spirits he did not so much as suffer to be praised. It is a
great virtue to dyspise humane and worldly glory: Despysynge of praise and
vayn glory.
he although he was god yet bare the person / and playde the part of a
servant or bondeman in earth / Johan. vi.
when a kingdom was offered to him he refused it / the glory of his doctrine
and of his miracles he referred whole to his father. The virtue of charity is
to hurt no man / and to do good to all men. Charity.
All his doctrine / his doing of miracles all to gether / to be short / his
whole life / was naught else but benefyce^cie and well doing toward all men:
he never sought those things that were for his own profyt or pleasure: but he
spent his own self whole / upon the profit of other men. This was that only
whole bren^ sacrifice and most pleasant and acceptable to god. How fervent a
saying of charity was that when he said. I am come to send fire into the earth
and what else do I will or desire than that it should be kendled and brenne?
Luce. xii.
I have a baptyme wherewith I must be baptized: and how am I troubled and vexed
in my mind to have it finyshed and brought to an end? John^.xv.
No man (says he) has greater charity or love than to spend his life for his
friends: he not only spente his life / but also suffered the ignominy and
shame of the cross / and that for his enemies also / with his last words
Luce. xxiii.
praying for them / by whom he was put on the cross / and with whose
blasphemouse words he was scorned and reuyled / even in the time of his
paynfull suffrynge. And yet for all that did not the lord say untruly / for
when he said * no man has greater charity he spoke of the charity and love
that is in man. There are told and recited in books / raither than are believed
certain exaumples of excellent love and frendshyp that has been between men as
of one friend that has put himself in dau^gyer and ieoperdye of his life for
another friend / but the charity and love that Christ had / passes all manner
charity of men / for that was an heuenlye: and not an earthlye fire / which ye
holy ghost did kendle and not natural affection: and are not we ashamed to be
called Christen men / which not only do spend our life for the saving of
our friends: but also for a small profit or advantage / with disceytes / lies
/ and periuryes / do begyle our neighbor / with violence do spoil and rob
him / with false accusations do bring him into danger of his life? Despysynge
of riches.
Couetou^nes or love of richesse is a common vice / as the contempt and
despisynge of riches is an excellent and a syngulare virtue. But who was more
naked and more pore in this world: than he / which had not where Math. viii.
Math. xxii.
he might so much as rest and lay down his head? which knew not the coin
of the emperor? (I speak as touching his manhede) whose clothes (which
spoil was only Johan. xix.
left) was distributed and parted among the soldyers? I do not say these
things / for that men should seche for paynfull and greuouse pouer^y: but for
tha^ it is a shame and a foul thing to him that has professed Christ / to
take poverty so impatiently / that he should cry out and call himself
therefore many times a wretch and a caytyfe. Why sholdeste thou be ashamed of
poverty / which is commune to the with Christ the lord of all things? Or why
does any man less esteem or regard his neighbor for pouertyes sake / and
does not rayther worship in him the likeness of the lord? Wrath or desire
of vengeance is a tyrannical affection. It is an hard thing to will well to
him / which has minyshed thy substance / which has gone about to take
away thy good name or thy life. But this thing shall be made more easy to the
/ Patience.
if thou have respect and do look unto that pure unspotted lamb / which was
so rayled on with so many reuylyng words / so many ways laid in wait for /
to make short / was bounde^ / bespytted / buffeted / and vexed with all manner
mockes and scorns / and hanged on a cross between.ii. thieves: and yet neither
with any word neither with any countenance or sign ever gave any
signification or betokenynge of an angry mind / neither spoke any other thing
than words of most fervent charity and myldenesse. Christ after his
resurrection appeared only to his disciples and friends
After his resurrection also he appeared only to his disciples and friends / to
the entente that he would both take away their heaviness / and also confirm and
establyshe their faith / he showed himself to none of the other / vpbrayding
and castyng in their tethe the purposes and enforcementes of their wicked
minds disapoyntyng and saying. I am he / whom you have wrongefully condemned
/ whom you have reuyled / whom you have coueted in such wise to be destroyed
/ that there should not remain so much as any sign or token of an honest
remembrance. I am now alive in spyte of all your tethes. But what did he? He
charged and commanded his apostles / that even to those same / of whom he had been cruelly and ungoodly handled / they should preach the grace of the gospel
/ that is to say / by faith in Christ free forgiveness of all sins / and
everlasting life in the world to come. This life brings with it many grefes
and incommodites. If we do suffer them patiently for the lords sake: To suffr^
with Christ.
we do suffer to gether with him / but much more / if we do suffer affliction
unworthily for ryghtousnesse and virtue. If we do practyse this daily / that
the desires of the flesh may without rebellion obey the spirit / we do learn
to dye with Christ. To dye with Christ.
If being departed from this world / not so much in body as in affection / we
do come at that perfection / we are buried to gether with Christ. To be buried
with christ
If by baptyme from dead works (that I may use Paul's words) we being ones
cleansed from al spots do walk from hence forward in newenesse of life /
not only not rollyng again into the myer / from which we were made clean /
but also hastyng to perfection by all degrees of virtues / To ascend with
Christ.
than do we rise again with Christ / which raised from death does / no
more dye / when by these means daily in us the contempt and despisynge of
earthlye things does encreace / and therewith also does encreace the desire of
the heavenly life / than do we with him ascend into heaven / with the fete of
our bodies treadyng on the earth / but with the affections and desires of the
heart being conuersaunt in heaven / in such wise orderyng all our thoughts /
and after such manner temperynge and disposynge all our deeds and works / as
though we did live in the sight and presence of god / and in the company of all
saynctes / as in very deed we do. Now are we come to the holy ghost / which
after the doctrine of sayncte Paul / is the geste and inhabiter of godly
minds / which has consecrated for a temple unto his owneselfe That man /
that does believe this: how is it possible / that he should not be afraid to
pollute the temple of god? (for it is polluted even with unclean thoughts:
also althouh the deed be away) and such an amiable and lovely tenant or geste
driven out / to make of the temple of god a stable or lodging of the dyuell?
without concord there is no holiness, nor felicite.
Christen concord is greatly commended / without which there is no religion or
holiness / no felicite or welthe. Of this concord haste thou a perfyte
exaumple in the father / the son / and the holy ghoste^ Another exaumple
next to it / haste thou in the name of the church: which is knyt to gether
with so many bonds / having but one god / one father all one laws / one
baptyme / all one the same sacraments / the same spirit / and waytyng and
lokyng after all one / and the same inheritance. In this church if any man
co^tynue: although he have fallen / he has many of whom he may be helped up
again ^ neither can he lightly miscary or peryshe / having so many
thousands of intercessoures praying for him. Those sheep that keep themselves
within the walls or compass of the fold: are in less danger of the wolf.
But because here in this world we have continual stryffe and batayl with our
aduersarye: we must walk warely and wisely according to the laws prescribed
and set o^ our captain and lord / to the obseruyng and keeping of which / for
as much as our imbecillite and weakness is nothing suffycient of it self / we
must with co^tynuall prayer beseech and desire heavenly help / which is ready to
all men / if a man do ask and desire it ferue^tly: if continually / if with a
tremblyng and a reverent faith and trust. To both these we shall be more mete
/ first if we do refer all that belongs to us unto god / as the fountain
and author. Seco^darely if we do accustom and wont our selves to have
respect not to ye particular persons / but to the whole universal company or
congregation of the church. If we will do the former of these two things / in all prosperouse things / and such as come to pass according to our minds /
we shall give thanks to god / and if any aduersyte shall chance us (whiles we
do take it patiently / as a thing sen^e of god / either to amend us / or else
to try and prove us) the outward evil or grefe shall be turned to us into
very good or profit I shall give the an evident exaumple. Thy corn comes up
prosperously in the feldes / here the pagane will praise his own policy and
labor / he will praise the temperate and sesonable wether of that somer. But
a christen man / likewise as if he had received all these things of the hand
of god / he gives thanks to his bountuose father / which with so great
largeness and liberalite does provide for his sons and servants. And if
any good thing be given or done to us by men / we shall acknowledge the
goodness of the lord / which has given to this man that he is both willing
/ and also able to do it. Again if any grefe or displeasure and hurt have
chanced to us by men / and as we do think of wrake or vengeance / it does
come to our mind and remembrance / it is better to suffer this iniurye
patiently / lest if he be provoked he do me greater hurt or displeasure / he
may being my friend recompense me this harm and damage with much encreace and
auau^tage: peradventure we do so deserve some praise of worldly wisdom / but no
praise at all of godliness / but if we do think thus to our selves / the lord
does by this man's malice scourge me / for his love I will suffer this vexatio^
what so ever it be: by this mean both shall we be less angry with our
neighbor: and also we shall be made more ready to the amendment of our life /
than to reuengynge of the iniurye done to us. Brefly worldly and carnal
affections or desires shall have the less tyranny in us / the violence of
which is wont to pluck us and carye us away from the observation and
fulfyllynge of gods laws / to synnefull and wretched deeds. Our mind is
therefore to be accustomed and wonted / that in all things / whether it be
prosperity or aduersite: it may forthwith set her eyes fas^e toward god.
Next thing to this is / that in our mind we do considre and behold the
universal church / as one body under one head Christ. By this mean it shall
be brought to pass / that both we shall be the less grieved with our harms
and incommodites / if we shall call to remembrance and reken / that we do
suffer them for many and with many. And also we shall rejoice more of other
men's good fortune and welthe / than of our own / neither shall we have envy
at any man: if we shall considre / that it is our own / what so ever good
thing the fellowship or company of the church has. Finally god shall here our
prayers the more gladly and wyllyngly: if we shall not every man do proprelye
and seuerallye his own business / but shall ask and desire common profit
and furthraunce to his honor and glory. For charity is the thing / that is
most acceptable and pleasant to god i. Cor. xiii.
but she does not seche those things that are her own: but those things that
are Jesus Christ's / now the church is the body of Christ. By this mean shall
it come to pass / that our lord being delyted with thy charity / shall give
the even the same thing which thou would have desired proprely and
particularely for thine own self / more largely and plentuosly / than if thou
haddeste asked it only for thyselfe. This consideration if it shall be turned
by often use and custom into an habyte: it shall so enlarge and comfort our
mind / that it shall not be offended with every manner thing / neither shall
it stond still at small offenses / neither when it should do a benefyte shall
it nyggardly count and reckon / he is a french man: and I am an almayne he is
a vile rascalle: and I am a noble man / he said this or that not long agoo by
me: but shall cherefully and gladly give a benefyte / as to the membre of
Christ / as to one that is christen / as to one that is a man. DISCIPLE. If it
should not be any pain or grefe to you: I would very gladly learn this also
of you / which are the principal and chief laws / according to which (as unto
the rule or line) a man ought to direct and order his works / and also which
is the best sourme and manner of prayinge. The.x. commandments of the law
MAG. The.x. precepts of gods law are known to every man / neither can any
man teach any better precepts than those which god himself has given or
taught / neither can there any better form and manner of prayer be prescribed
than that which our lord himself has vouchesafed to prescribe and teach /
for the son knows best / with what form and manner of prayer his father
most specially is delyted and pleased. DIS. But those precepts and
commandments were given by Moses to the Jews. Now our lord has
delyueryd us from that law. MAG. God forbid it my dear son / the whole law
is owers / and agreith with the gospel / save that we do now profess and
knowledge that thing to be done and fulfilled / which they did look for
afterward to come / and also save that the same thing which was spoken and put
forth to them as being rude and begynners / in rydles and dark fygures to us
is said and spoken in a more plain and clear manner. Only certain outward
ceremonies are partly put quyte and clean away / and partly are changed and
applied to the ^uangelicall virtue and holiness. But as for the other precepts
or commandments: the gospel does none otherwise deliver and make us free
from them / save that by the reason that charity is augmented in us / we do
those things wyllyngly and gladly of our own accord / which the commune
sort and most part of the Jews did for fear of pain or ponyshement / for
else what a lyberty (I beseech you) should that be: if we might forswear our
selves / do adultery / or committee theft? Did Christ therefore come into the
world / that we should have lyberty to sin vnponyshed? No verily / but that
we should not sin at all / as being borne again into him / which knows
no whytte of sin / we do honor and worship the same god whom the Jews did
honor: all be it as touching to the rytes or ceremonies and manner of
immolations and sacrifices / we do worship him after another fasshyon. And the
fountain of all the commandments is that first / that is to say the
greatest of all: to love god with all our heart / and our neighbor as our
owneselfe / for this speech does summarily and brefly comprehend all the
precepts of living / and who so ever does want these two points / although
he does perform and fulfill that thing / which the words of the law do
prescribe and command and though he does avoid and estewe that / which the
law does forbydde: yet for all that does he not observe and fulfill the law /
as for exaumple / if a man does not kill his enemy / not for that he does not
owe him evil will / but for that he does fear the ponyshement thretened by the
law: this man is a manqueller before god. But that man / whom in the heat of
anger / the love of god and of his neighbor does revoke and call back from
doing myschefe / and which thinks thus to himself / god forbid that for cause
of any man being enemy to me. I should fall out from the frendshyp and love of
god / and hurt my neighbor to whom although he be an evil man / yet I
ought to will well for gods sake / to whom it is most pleasa^^te and
acceptable / if for an injury and displeasure / we do a good turn again /
neither forces it to me / though man does make but evil recompense to me for
my benefytes / I have a trusty and a sure faithful detter / to whom I lend
this stock to have encreace / he will pay me again with inestimable lucre or
gaynes: that man (I say) that thus does thynk only has observed and fulfilled
the commandment of the law. D. Now I long to here those.x. laws written with
the finger of god. MA. They are recited in the xx. chapitour of Exodi / neither
do they need any declaration (for the words of a law ought to be plain and
clear) and if any thing in them does need or require an interpretour or
expositour: there are very many men / which have done this allredy
sufficiently. Only I shall in few words admonyshe and give warnyng / that
every one of these precepts does stretch further / and are extended more
largely / namely among christen men: than the commune sort and the most
part of men does judge or think. The first precepte therefore is this. The
first commandment.
Thou shall not have any strau^g gods in my sight / thou shall not make the
any graven image / nor any manner similitude / or lykenes / which is in the
firmament above / and which is in the earth benethe / neither of those
things which are in the waters under the earth. This precepte agreith with
the first article of the Creed: so that it needs not here to make many words
/ and I have allredye told the / that this precepte is violated and broken /
not only of them / which do worship the son / the moon / and the sterres /
or else a man / a serpente / an ox / or a kowe / or a dog / or else do
worship the images of these reherced things / or else offendes instead of
god: but also to idolatry do enclyne and appertain all curiouse arts and
craf^es / All curiouse arts appertain to idolatry.
of diuyning and sothesaying / of iuglyng / of doing cures by charms or
withcraft in which although there be none express conspiration with deuylles
or wicked spirits yet nevertheless is there some secret dealyng with them /
and so therefore a secre^e denyinge of god. If thou desyrest an evident
argument and token hereof / it is ready and not to seche / when the inchauntoure
goes about to take out of thy body the head of a darte or of an arow / say
this with good faith to thyselfe / if this thing be done with the will and
pleasure of god / I pray god it may do me help or ease / if not / I had lever
suffer the wound of my body / than the wyckednes of my mind: thou shall see the
inchauntour to labor all in vayn. Neither is it unknown to me what they are
wont to lay for themselves / which do set great store by the art called
magia naturalis / and which do greatly esteem and regard the judicial
astronomye. It belongethe to the christian religion and holiness / to flee even
from those things also / which have the parell and danger / or else the
apperaunce of impietye or mysbelefe. That man refuses and forsakes all these
things / who so ever he be / that truly professyng one very god has abiured
all false gods. Nor we ought not so much as to receive any benefyte of any
man / which is given with the offendynge and displeasynge of god. To make
short. Every crime appertayne^h to idolatry. Every crime is a spyce of
idolatry.
He that for his wives pleasure has offended god: has renyed god / and has
honored his wife for a goddess. He that for the kings pleasure does spoil
wards and fatherless children that never deserved it / or which does commytte
any other like crime: he does honor the prince instead of god / let them
flatter and dysceyue themselves as much as they list / let them reherce this
precept every day a thousand times professyng god with their mouths: yet Paul
cries against them / saying: they deny god with their deeds or works. Tite.
i.
DIS. Why are they not than ponyshed as idolaters? MA. Because partly the
fraylte and weakness belonging to the nature of man does excuse them / and
partly the great multitude of them that do offend: but especially because
it is a very hard thing for us to judge of the mind of man. Nota.
But who so ever all their life time of a set purpose do goo about to get
riches by right or wrong / by hoke or by croke / do hunte after pleasures /
layinge a part both the dread and also the love of god: let them know and
understand surely / that they are no whytte better than thy are / which do
brenne frankyn sense in the honor of Iuppiter / or which do slay a lamb in
sacrifice to Uenus / or else a got in the honor of the god Bacchus. DIS.
Sithe in the same commandment images are with so great diligence for boden
to be made: Of images in the churches.
how fortuneth it that now a days the churches of christendom are full of
images. MAG. The people of the Jews was very gross and meruaylously
inclynyng and ready to the superstition of the Gentiles: so that scantly they
did believe any thing to be / which they did not see with their eyes: and
therefore the law with so many words fearyd them keapynge them far away from
the most parylouse and daungerful pyt or dyche. Now after that all paynnymrye
is by the light of the gospel extincte and destroyde: there is not the same
ieopardye and danger that was than: and if any point of superstition does
remain still in the minds of certain unlearned men / it may easily be put
away by good admonition and holy doctrine. Untyll saynct Hieronymes time
there were holy and devout men (and so were they taken and allowed) which did
not suffer any image to be in the churches / neither painted / nor graven /
neither wouen / no not so much as of Christ / (as I trow / because of the
Anthropomorphites:) but by little and little the use of images has cropen in /
into the churches. And peradventure it should not be very unseemly or
unsitting / if in those places / in which god is solemnelye and communelye
honored / none images at all were set / beside the image of Christ
crucified. Of paynting what profit does come: if it be aptely and conveniently
used.
But ye^ payntyng / if it be metely and conveniently used and put to / besides
the honest pleasure that it brings or causes / it does also help very
much to remembrance / and to the understanding of the history / wherefore it
was said not unwisely nor vnproprely of one / I wot not how / but payntyng is
to unlearned men the same thing / Pictures are the books of unlearned me^
that books are to learned men / ye moreover even a learned man also does
otherwhyles in payntynge see more / than he does in books or writing / and is
more vehemently moved or styrred to affections: as we should be more moved and
styrred / if we did see Christ hangyng on the cross / than if we did read /
that he was crucified. And payntyng sets the thing forth to the eye / as
far forth as is possible and perfourmeth that euidencie / making the thing
manifest: which many men with crafty spech and narration do couete to attain
/ and yet can not / but the life of Christ and of the apostles / namely that
which is showed and written in the canonical scriptures: should do very well to
be set in alayes or yles / in the porches / and in cloystres. For such manner
images do put into our minds certain holy and godly thoughts: even when we
are occupied about other things. And likewise as of the old fathers it was
very well constituted and ordained / that nothing should be recited or red in
the churches beside the canonical scripture / so were it convenient / and would
do very well / if in holy places there were nothing set forth in picture or
caruyng which is not had in the holy scriptures. Last of all / Exodi.xxv.
Moses by the commandment of god / did set in the tabernacle two cherubims
of gold / in the highest parts of the Propitiatory. iii. Reg. vi^.
And in the vessels of the temple which Solomon did build: there were graven
images of oxen / of lions / and of the cherubims. Again in the third
chapitoure of the second book of Paralipomenon / the cherubims are graven on
the walls. In the mytre of the bishop / was the image of the moon: Exodi.xxvii^
in his garment / the images and similitudes of pomes granates. It is not
lykely therefore / that to ye Jews was utterly forboden all kinds and sorts
of images: but it was forfended the^ that they should have images after the
manner of the paynymes / that is to say / which should be set forth to be
adourned and worshypped. The book of Deuteronomium as it were expoundynge and
declaryng this same when it does reherce this precepte / it adds. Deute. v.
Non adorab^s ea neque coals: thou shall not honor nor worship them. And for
the same purpose and intent was added in the.xx. chapitoure of Exodi these
words coram me.i. in my sight / or presence / or before me. That image is set
in the sight of god: which is made egall to god for nothing / that wants
reason: Adoratio
is apt to receive adoration / that is to say outward veneration and worship /
nor cultum / that is to wit / inward veneracion and honor. Cultus
A christen man / if he does bow his head to the image of Christ crucified /
he knows that none honor is due to the wodde or tree / but through the
occasion of ye image he does worship that thing / which the image does
represent. Now if any man for the love of Christ does love the image of Christ
/ i^ so much that he does otherwhy les kiss it / and does lay it up in a
clean place (so that superstition be away) I do suppose that this affection and
devotion is not unpleasant to god. For else when we do i^ the church kiss the
gospel book we do not worship the parchemente / or ye gold / or the yuery / but
we do worship the doctrine of Christ. And peradventure it shall not be
unprofitable / if the bysshopes / every one of them in his own diocese / do
ordain and decree concerning this matter according to the present vt^lite of
their flock / but yet so / that it be done without disturbau^ce / sedition and
injury / for that there should be images in the churches / there is not so
much as even any constitution made by man / that does command it. Nota.
And as it is a more easy thing and sooner brought about / even so it is also a
more suerer way and further from leoperdye / to put out all images from the
churches / than to obtain or bring about / that neither measure shall be passed
in them / nor superstition mengled or put to in ye vsyng of them. Now although
the mind be pure from all superstition / yet it is not without the apperau^ce
of superstition / wha^ one y^ makes his prayers / does knele or fall down
flat before a treen image / and has his eyes fast set and lokynge upon it /
speakethe to it / gyuethe kysses to it / nor does never pray at all / but before
an image. This will I add moreover who so ever does feign and ymagine to
themselves god to be another manner one / than he is: To imagine god to be
another manner one / than he is in very deed: is idola^^ie.
they do contrary wise to this precepte worship images of their own making.
The Jews have none images in their temples: but they have in their minds
most foul idols / whiles they do ymagine the father to be without a son /
wha^ in very deed he has a son / whiles they do ymagine him to be alone when
he has in his felowshyppe the son / and the holy ghost. They do not
therefore worship and honor god / so as they do boste and make auaunt that
they do: but in the stead of god they do worship an idol: which they have
framed and made to themselves in their own minds. Thus much to have said for
cause of exaumple / let it suffice at this time / the residue thou shall guess
of thine owneselfe. But for as much as the dignite of that most high and
soueraygne magestie requires this / that not only thou sholdeste have a
meruaylouse good opinion of it in thy mind / nor only that thou sholdest
abstain from the worshyppynge of idols / but also that thou sholdeste not
dishonor it among men / so much as with any vnreuerent or vnsittyng word it
is therefore added. The secound precept.
Thou shall not take the name of god in vain / for customable usage of light
words / does by little and little mynishe in the minds both of the speakers
and also of the hearers / the reverence that is due to god. But such was the
manner of the Gentiles or paynymes / which i^ every thing welnere / were it
never so try^^yng and folyshe / ye or else never so fylthy and rybaldouse
communication: used oftentimes to repete these words by Iuppiter Edepoll /
Ecastor / Medius / Fidius: and would god that there were no christen men now a
days / which of a lewed and vngratiouse custom / at every third word do put
to an other / by god / by gods death / namely when they play at diese or
cards / or else when being well wette they do make sacrifice to the god Bacchus
/ we do read that certain emperoures of the Romans / although they were
paynymes / did command those me^ to be chastened with whyppes which had
sworn per genium principis. And among the Jews the name of god was had in so
great reverence and honor: that they did write that mystical and privy
name / which they do call tetragrammaton / with letters not to be expressed or
pronounced: but let this be given to the gross minds of the Jews (for god is
as much innominable: as he is mymaginable and invisible) it belongs to the
evangelical holiness / never to name god or Christ / or the holy ghost /
without great cause or vnreue^ently: lest the words or communications be
turned and do go into affections / and affections be turned and do go into
operations and deeds. This thing is to be noted and marked / that he did not
say / thou shalt not name god: but he said thou shalt not take the name of
god. For that thing is taken: which he applied and put to some use / and that
thing is taken in vain and indiscreetly: which is taken to a profane and a
vile use / as when a man swereth by god in a matter of small wayghte or valor
/ for those men that do swear / to the intent that by the reason of their oath
they might the sooner and more easily disceyue / or which do swear by the
reason of dronke^nes / or wrath / or for their pleasure: those men (I say)
are very nere to blasphemye. At the least wise let us give that reverence to
god the prince and lord of all creatures / which the french men The manner of
franch me^.
do give to their king / which do never name their king / but puttyng to
words of good luck / and touching their bonette. Let us therefore / when we
do name god / or Christ / either bow our knees / or do of our cappes / or if
it be so / that we may do neither of these.ii. at the least wise with some
little bowynge of the head / and with some countenance let us show outwardly
some token of reverence. DISCIPLE. By this communication of yours.iiii. doutes
iiii. doutes.
do prycke and trouble my mind The first is / because this precepte semethe to
belong unto the love of our neighbor / in as much as we are forbidden by
this name to begyle or disceyue our neighbor. The secounde is / for that by
this secound precept that thing seems to be permytted / which by the first
commandment was forboden: for the name of god is a creature and like to an
image.

The third is / because the same thing seems to be forboden by this precepte
/ which was forbode^ by the first precept / for no man does wytiyngly
forswear himself by god / which has good opinion and judges well of god /
for either he judges that god does not know the minds of men / or else that he
is not offended with sins. The fourth is / that they / which do now a days
swear / for the most part do seem to violate and break this commandment:
for (according to the saying of the wise preacher) in worldly things
pertaining to men is vanite of vanites / and all is but vanite. Ecclesiastes i
In these things therefore it should never be lawful to swear. MAG. Answer
to the first dout
To make the answer in few words to every one of these things. The.iii.
first precepts are in a certain manner one / and do chefely appertain to
Latriam which is the greatest and highest worship / which is due to god only /
as unto him that is best of all / and whose hyghnes does not receive the
fellowship of any creature. But as far forth as the contempt and despysynge
of god does redounde to the hurt of the neighbor: so far forth this
precept does also appertain to the love of our neighbor / likewise as also
every injury done against our neighbor does appertain to the contumelte and
dishonor of god / for as much as in him is / that man does hurt god / which
setting at naught his commandment / does hurt his neighbor / but he is
more nere to blasphemy / which does begyle his neighbor / swearynge by the
name of god: than he is that disceyueth him with simple and plain words
without an oath / for he abuses to his own lewed affection and desire / both
the honor of gods name: and also the religion and devotion of his
neighbor / which by reason of the name of god being put to / does believe him
upon his oath / and would not have believed him without an oath. To the secounde
doubt I make this answer. To the second.
The name of god spoken or pronounced of man / is a creature / neither to that
word is the knee bowed: but to him whom that voice or word does signifye
and betoken. Now it is nothing like of an image / for there is no peril lest
the voice or word of a man should be worshypped: but in images there is no
ieopardye / because certain philosophers have taught that likewise as into a
body being aptely made of nature / a soul does enter: even so into an image
proprely and connyngly made deuylles or wicked spirits do enter in. And it is
necessary that god by some sign or token be declared and sygnifyed / for and
unto which use the speech of man was chefely and principally instituted and
ordained. To the third doubt.
To the third doubt this answer take thou / that (after my mind) those men /
which done swear in their drunkenness / or in their anger / or which for the
intent to dysceyue or to hurt / done wyttyngly for swear theyrselues: are
rayther breakers of the first precept and commandment / than of the second /
for such manner persons (as thou doste say) either do not believe that god is /
or else they do believe that he is dull and foolyshe / that he does not know
what men done / or else they beleuen / that he is slepy and retcheles / that he
does not care what they done / or that he is evil / so that he does favor
vices / or else vnryghtuouse / that he does not ponyshe noughtynes. But those
persons / which either of custom / or else without great cause / do wilfully
swear / they do sin and trespase against this second commandment. And
that I may answer somewhat also unto the fourth doubt. To the.iii^^ doubt.
Our lord among his aduertisementes and counsaylles of perfection puts this
also / that we should utterly abstain from swearynge any manner oath. Math. v.
The same thing has seemed best to certain approved doctoures of the church.
But with what color the custom may be excused of the^ / that now every
where done swear well nere in every matter or business / let other men look /
but verily me seems that an oath can scantly be excused / but either by
necessyte / or else by the grauite and wayghtynesse of the matter. By often
oaths / we do learn to forswear our selves and to make false oaths. I can
not tell whether any man do swear well / which swereth willingly. Nota.
S Paul does swear / but not for a cloak or garment / nor for money / but for
the honor and glory of ye gospel. How be it yet I will not say / that every
custom or rashenes of swearynge is dealy sin / but doutlesse it is very
cosen and nere to sin / and it is no good trustyng to this daungerouse
waterbanke.

Therefore the more sure way is to follow the counsayll of our lord / and of
sayncte James. The third commandment
The third precept has diverse respects / for it appertains to the
honoring of god / prescribyng and appoyntyng every.vii. day / in which man
should altogether / that is to say / both in mind and body give himself to the
works belongyng to the honor of god / which is called Latria / that is to
wit / to hymns / to prayers / to holy doctrine / to sacrifices / and to
almoyse deeds / and to other exercyses and passetymes / which do quycken and
stir up faith and love toward god: lest any man might excuse himself /
and say that he had no laysour for his necessary occupations and busynesses /
to gather his mind to those things / which are appertaynynge to devotion and
honoring of god. It appertains also to humanite and gentleness toward our
neighbor / for so great was both the vnmercyfulnes and also the covetousness
of ye Jews in the old time (and even so is it now a days of some christen
men (a lack the more pitye it is) that they would grant no recreation or rest
at all from labor / to their bondemen / to their handemaydes and to their
hired laborers or servants being alienes and strangers. And this cause
does not the law dyssemble or hyde / when it adds in the.v. chapitour of
Deuteronomium Deute. v.
Remember that thyselfe also have ben bond and haste served in Egypt / and
that thy lord god has brought the out from thence: to the end that the
remembrance of gods myldenes and gentleness should be an exaumple to them of
humanite and gentleness to ve used toward their neighbor. For like cause was
the Iubile instituted / that is to say / the year of lyber^tie and fredom /
every seventh year. The Iubile^ Deute. xv.
And as for that which is added in the.v. chapitour of Deuteronomium of the ox
also and ^^e ass / either it was set against the insatiable covetousness of
certain men / which / when it is not lawful for themselves to exercise any
seruyle work yet do let forth their beasts to other men / upon the sabbot
day / for lucre of money / or else is it an hyperbole or exces added to the
intent / that we should be removed further away feom inhumanite and
vnmercyfulnes toward men / sith we are bidden to spare even our beasts also
/ for this vnmercyfulnes or cruelty toward brute beasts / is a degree and
step to vnmercyfulnes and crueltye toward those men / that are subjects
unto us / for the ox and the ass also done us service. And as for this saying
of Paul. ^. Cor. x.
Has god any care or mind of oxen? He means not by it that god has no care
at all of oxen (for as much as according to the witness of our lords Math. x.
owneselfe in the gospel / there does not so much as a little sparow fall to
the ground without him) but he denies that gods only and chief care is of
oxen / for likewise as he has created the helping beasts for man's cause /
even so does he care and provide for them / for man's cause. ^IS. What is a
seruyle work? MAG. For what work is called ser^yle.
sothe all manner outward work / which is wont to be exercysed for cause of
lu^re and getynge of money / as husbondrie / carpentrie / bying and selling /
and such other like. DISCIPLE. Why is that forboden / that is an holy work?
MAG. For what intent the bodily labor is forbode^ to be used on the sabbote
day.
This outward work is not forboden as being vitiouse and noughty / but
therefore is it prohibited / that the work which is of it self good / should
give place to that work which is best / and to that work / for whose For
what work man was created chiefly.
cause man was principally and chefely created and made / that is to wit /
that he should know / should worship / should honor / and should love god above
al things. DIS. May not god be honored but by bodily rest and abstaynynge
from labor? MAG. Nota.
yes verily / he both may and ought to be honored also in ye mids of our
labors. But uneath may a man lift up his mind toward god / so as is mete
and according that he should do / except he be free from such manner labors /
which both do consume and spend away the time / and also done challenge to
themselves a great part of the ^ynde / and done call away from the be^^tie
and comelynes of the open and co^mun^ assemble. Therefore this law was chefely
and pri^cipally given to weak men and of gross mind / to the intent that by
outward rest of the body they should learn to have their mind also idle and at
rest from all troublouse affections and desires / that is to wit / from
hatred / from wrath / from ambition and desire of honor or promotio^ / from
all fleshely lust / and such other carnal affections. They therefore yt did so
rest on the sabbot days / y they spend those days either in sleep / or in
tryflyng tales / or in sluggeshnes or idleness: they did in no wise observe and
fulfill this commandment / for as much as they did not that thing / for
whose cause this precept was given. And therefore the law speaks thus.
Remember thou / that thou do sanctify the day of rest / for to sanctify: is
to spend in holy works / and not to profane or pollute it with any
operations unseemly or unmeet for god. DIS. Why was the.vii. day appointed to
this? MAG. The law it self has expressed the cause / sayng. Sabbatum.
The seventh day is the sabbote of thy lord god. Now sabbaton in the Hebrew
tongue / is as much to say / as rest. This same thing was more plainly spoken
in the.xxxi. chapitour of Erodi. In syx days the lord made heaven and earth
and in the.vii. day he ceased or rested from al work / Do not here imagine a
frame or building wrought and fynished with the labor of.vi. days / and than
the master workman being weary on the syxte day to have recreated and
refreshed himself of his werynes in the seventh day with rest and idleness. The
intent of the whole book of Genesis.
The whole mystical scripture of Genesis entendeth this / that the Jews
should remember / that this world was created and made of god / not to the end
that we should rest in those things which are of this world: but that we by
the things created / having knowledge of the creator and maker / should
according to his exaumple rest from the love of visyble things / and by
faith and innocence of life (which is the true peace and rest of the mind)
make haste unto that eternal rest. Thou hear here after a certain manner
three sondrie sabbots. Three man^^ sabbotes.
The first was the sabbote of god alone / without us. The secounde sabbote is
owers by his beneficence and goodness / but imperfect here in this life. The
third sabbote is perfyte in the world to come. Besides this he would / that
the unkind and forgetful people should have in remembrance the mercy of god
/ by which they had been delivered from the most hard and cruel servitude of
Pharao / which figure does also teach us / that we should have in memory /
that we have been redeemed by the blood of ye unspotted lamb from the most foul
tyranny of the dyuell: lest through unkindness we do fall again into greater
bondage and thraldom. DIS. you said ones that the law of Moses / as
concerning ceremonies / was abrogated and taken away. But this commandment
for the most part seems to appertain to the kind or sort of ceremonies.
MAG. I said that certain ceremonies were abrogated / but not all / for it is
not abrogated to pray unto god knelyng on our knees neither is fasting nor
sermons abrogated / and I said that certain were changed and applied to the
euangelical holiness and honoring of god / of which sort is the observation
and keeping of the sabbote day. why the.vii. day was changed into the.viii.
day.
DIS. Why than is the.vii. day turned to us into the.viii. day? MAG. Uerily
it is credible / that it was done by the auctorite of the Apostles. The day was
changed / lest if we had agreed with the Jews in this point / we might
seem to agree with them in the residue also / likewise Chrysostom
as Chrysostom (and yet not he alone) does with meruaylous dilygence and
affection fear away christen men from fasting upon the same days / on which
the Jews did communely and customably fast. DIS. Than was not the.vii. day
without great skylle and for great consideration changed into the.viii. why
more in to the.viii. day / than into the.x. or.xii. or any other day.
day rayther than into the.x. or into the xii. day? MAG. Thou say very well.
For god after a certain manner has twyse created or made the world / and man
in it / for first he created it of naught / doutlesse by his son. God after
a certain manner has made the world twyse.
Secondarily by the same son being incarnate / he restored that which was
perysshed and forlorn. There he is said to have rested from the work of
creation. Here Christ resting from the works of dispensation whiles he
rests with his body in the grave: he does as it were abrogate and put away
the judicial obseruyng of the sabbote day / and whiles he rysethe again
immortal early in the break of the.viii. day / he commended to us the
evangelical sabbote. And therefore is this day called dies dominicus.i. the day
of the lord / and in it does the quyere in the church sing. Hic dies quem
fecit dominus id est. Psalm. C.xvii.
This is the day / which the lord has made / and it is called Dies Pasche.i.
the day of passing over / by the very name putting us in remembrance of
the old figure. Exodi. ^ii.
The Jews / after that they had been refreshed and fed with a lamb / they
passed over the read see. We being refreshed and wedde with the blood of
Christ / do go to the heavenly land. Exodi. xii.
The blood of a lamb spryncled on the sides of the door / saved them from the
destroynge angel / the blood of Christ has delivered us from the tyranny
of sin. DIS. These things forsothe done meruaylously well agree to gether in
every point. But is it enough / if a man do worship and honor god on the
sondayes? MAG. To godly me^ every day is sunday and after what manner.
To those that are verily virtuous and godly / every day is sunday / or the
lords day / not for that he does always abstain from outward labors or
works / but for that he does every day / as often as he has oportunite /
oftentimes lift up his mind toward god / stirrynge up faith / provoking
charity / kendlynge hope / praysynge him with hymns: desyryng some wholesome
thing of him / gyuenge thanks to him for all things. But likewise as it is a
point of godlynes to practice this thing daily / so is it an exceeding great
and an horrible offense / not to do it on ye sondayes when the institution and
ordinance of Christ and of the apostles / and the commune assemble and
coming to gether of the christen people / besides this to holy redyng / the
prechyng of the word of god / and holy and devout ceremonies instituted of
good holy fathers / done provoke and call us hereunto. DIS. whether they do
sin deadly: that work on the sondayes.
Do they than sin deadly: which done any work on the holidays? MAG. ye
forsothe that they do / except either great necessyte / or else great vtilite
do excuse them: which thing our lord himself has evidently taught us in
the gospel / when he excuses his disciples / Math. xii.
for that they did pluck the ^ares of corn on the sabbotedaye / and alleges
the Levites / which wrought in the temple on the sabbotedayes / and when he
lays against the phariseis finding Math. xii.
fault that he did heal men on the sabbotedaye / lays against them (I say)
that their selves did on the sabboteday led their ox to the water / and if
their ass were fallne into a dyche / they would not let to draw him out
even on the sobboteday. Mar. ii.
Finally when he pronounced that man was not made for cause of the sabboteday /
but that the sabbotday was instituted and ordained for man's cause / so that
thou may perceive and understand that this precepte is not of that sort
that it ought never to give place unto charity. The keeping of the holy day
must otherwhyles give place to charity.

DISCIPLE. How does this agree / that it should be called the day of rest:
when we do read otherwhyles / in that day shall you ponyshe and vex your
souls? MAG. This song was songen to the Jews / to whom it belongs to weep
/ because they have not the spouse. Math. ix.
The christen men have a far other song / which exhorten each other saying.
Psalm. C.xvii
Exultemus et letemur in ca: let us rejoice and be merry in this day. In the
old time in many congregations they fasted on the saterdayes / to the end that
they might come with more clean minds unto the celebrite of the sunday or the
lords day. Now if it be so that any man yet be of judicial affections / let
him by confession and penance ponyshe his soul / that being reconciled to
god / he may with a quiet or restefull mind use and enjoy the joys of the
day. For hereof is it called in the commune tongue of the germans soendach /
Soendache has his na^^ of reconcilyng.
not of the son / as certain men done interpret / but of reconcilynge /
that if in the other wekedayes any spotte or fylthe of sin be gathered by the
reason of worldly business and occupations / he should either on the saterdaye
in the euentyde / or else on sunday in the morning / reconcile himself / and
make an onement with god / and furthermore that if he be at variaunce and
debate with any man / he should cast it clean out of his mind / that both
being pure from hatrede / and also being quiet from all sin / he may enter
in to the temple of the lord. Those men therefore / which according to the
saying of our lord.

Learn you of me / Math. x^.
for I am mylde and lowly in heart / and you shall find rest to your souls /
i. Pet. ii.
as it were children newlye borne have laid away all malice / and being above
all worldly things / are with all their mind carried up unto the contemplation
of that everlasting rest / those men I say only do feel and perceive how
great a felicite / and a thing of how great joy / and of how great
quietness it is / to celebrate and keep the evangelical sabbotedaye / what it
is to keep the eua^gelicall sabbote.
that is to wit after the imitation and following of our lords buryall / to
express and countrefayte his resurrection / for this is the very sa^^bote of
god / for the world has certay^^ sabbotes / that is to say certain reste^
or quietnesses outwardly / but inwardl^ it has labors far more seruyle /
th^^ the Hebrews did suffer / Exodi.i.
when they dy^ serve the Egyptianes in carrying daub^ and brycke. DIS. These
things for^ sothe have you spoken and declared playn^ly and evidently enough
/ for my capacite. MAG. The greateste wyckednes of all is that / which is done
and committed directly and immediately against god. Next unto it is that by
which god is offended in that we do hurt our neygh^boure. God is to be honored
and loved for himself: and man for gods sake. Next after god the chefeste
honor is due to our pare^tes / by whom god has given to us the benefyte of
life by whose care and dilygence he has fosterd and brought us up / where else
we should have peryshed / by whom he has instructed and taught us unto the
knowledge of god the hygheste and soueraygne father of all men / and has
auaunced us unto the love of him. The.iiii. commandment.
Therefore he says. Honor thy father and thy mother / that thou may be
longlyued upon the land which thy lord god shall give to the. what is meaned
by honor otherwhyles.

Cicero.v. tusculanaru^ questionum


This word honos in the Latyne tongue does oftentimes signify reward: as in
that sayng of the commedie. Hic tibi ab ^^lo habitus est honos.i. This reward
is given to the of him / and in that saying honos alit arts.i. reward
nourysheth arts or sciences. Therefore service and kyndnesse toward our
parents is a certain recompensation of the costs / and of the pains and
labors / which they have bestowed upon us in our infancye and young age /
whiles the mother suffers and abides the irksomeness of bearyng us in her
womb / of trauaylynge in the birth of us / and the labors of geuyng suck
and nourishynge us / and also of the long cares / which the father does suffer
in minystryng and fyndyng to us all costs and charges / and doing his
uttermost diligence to provide that his chylderne may be taught and instructed
to the true faith and godly living. Now it happens oftentimes that the
father and mother either sore broken and febled with age / or else by some other
casualte and chance fallen into poverty and misery: do need again
anotherwhyle the help and aid of their children. Here in this case we are
mo^^ bound unto our parents. The Gr^^^kes do call this recompensation of lou^
and kyndnes to our parents / an^ipela^^gosin: Antipelargosis.
because the birds called in the Greek pelargi / in the Latyne cicon^e^ are
said to bear on their backs / an^ to feed and cherishe their parents beyng^
feeble and faynte for age. And among the Gentiles / Eneas is commended: Eneas.
which took his father Anchises up on his own^ sholders / and carried him out
from the city being all on a fire. ^ale max. li. v. Tit. de pic tate erga
parents.
Among the same Gentiles / the young woman also has not ben without praise:
which nourysshed her mother privily with her own pappes / Pietas.
wherefore to the love of god and to the love of our parents / is given one
commune name in the Latyne / that is to wit pietas. what this word pietas
does proprely signifye.
For pietas proprely is called the affection or love toward god and toward
our parents / and toward our country / which is as it were a commune parente
of many men / likewise as god is the father of all men. To make recompense to
those persons / by whom either we have received / or recovered our life: is a
point belongyng to piety or natural love. To do a good turn to them /
which have before done good to us: is a point of kyndnes. Great honor / love
/ and thank is o^ duty to be given to our masters and teachers
And to our masters or teachers also we owe excellent and singular love and
honor / because that likewise as of our pare^tes it is long that we live /
even so of our teachers it is long that we live well / and likewise as we may
thank our parents / and are detters to them for the life of our body / even
so may we thank our teachers / and are detters to them for the life of our
mind. We are borne brutyshe and beastly (for what else can we make of it) by
teaching and information we are made men. Uery much honor therefore is due to
those parents: which have given unto us all these things to gether. DIS. What
if both the mother do refuse the irksomeness of gyueng her chyldern suck:
and neither father nor mother does teach and nourtoure them to good manners /
but do use their children / as if they were bond slaves / and do require
obedience and service of them / to honest deeds.

MAGISTER. The less that they have been beneficial and have done the office of
parents to their children: the less honor is due to them / and yet for all
that they also are to be obayd^ and pleased for gods sake (accordyng^ to that
saying of the tragedy. If thou^ were not my father?) except peradventure they
do command or appoynte things to be done / which are displeasaunte to
almighty god / for than it is mete and according to say unto them / we ought
to obey god rather than men. Actuum.v.
Now that which has been said of the parents: appertains also to al those
/ which are joined to us by nerenesse of blood / or which have done those
benefytes to us / which natural and loving parents are wont to do to their
own children / Nota.
for to have begotten the body is the least part of the offices belongyng to
parents. It does no doubt of it / be come us to be beneficial toward all
men: but yet there is an order to be used in doing of benefytes. There is an
order in doyinge benefytes.
Next after our father and mother / as every one is next of blood to us / so
is he first to be helped and releued / lest our liberalite being consumed and
spent upon other fremmed persons / we have not wherewith to succurre and help
our own kynsfolke. Saint Paul pronounces that i. Timo. v.
woman to be worse tha^ an infidele which takethe no care nor prouydethe for her
own householde / not for yt it is a more grievous sin not to have mind and
care of our kynsfolke / than it is / not to give credence to the gospel: but
for that such a manner woman does not so much as that benefyte to her kynsfolke
which even the very hethen women are wont to do to those that are of their
kynne^ al be it that the faith and religion of the The religion of the gospel
does not abrogate / but does make perfyte the affections of nature.

Marci. vii.


gospel does not abrogate or put away the natural affections: but does make
them full and perfyte. And in the gospel our lord does disalow them / which
caryng no whytte for their fathers and mothers did give their goods i^
offrynges into the treasure of the temple. I will add this moreover. This
precept does not only appertain to fathers and mothers: but also it
appertains to byshopes / to teachers / and to officers and rulers / which
after a certain manner done bear the room and stead of parents / for to
whom so ever honor is commanded to be given: they are again even by the
same commandment bydden to do those benefytes and works / unto which great
thank and honor is due. And therefore sayncte Paul in the.vi. chapitoure of
his Epistle to the Ephesianes / and in other places repetyng this precept and
commandment: does pu^ both parties in remembrance of their office and
duty. Ephe. vi.
And you fathers (says he^ do not provoke your children to anger (...) wrath /
but bring the^ up in the instruc^tion and the correction or the chastisemen^
of the lord / wha^ he forbyddeth the children to be moved or styrred unto
wrath: he does exclude lordely rule or governance / and wha^ he adds in the
correptio^ or chastiseme^t of the lord: he does commend mylde and gentle
teaching and informatio^ to virtuous and godly living that we should be such
manner ones toward the^ that are under our rule and gouerna^ce: as ye lord
has been toward us / for with what face / and how for shame they do
compain of their children / yt they are not thryftie and vertuose: when their
own selves have taught them and brought them up to ryote / wantonness / and
unthriftiness? D. Are tha^ all those longelyued / which done louyngly honor
and succurre their pare^tes? M. This thing has s. Paul noted and marked out /
that to this first precept is added a reward even in this life also / but it
was nedeful to speak in such wise to the gross and carnal Jews which like
infau^^es or babes were to be allured and entysed to works of virtue and
godlynes with the promysse and hope of te^porall co^modites. They being hardly
and cruelly handled in Egypt and also being weryed with long iornayes through
ye deserts and wyldrenesses / were meruaylouse gredy and desirous to come ones
into the land of promission flowynge with milk and honey: and therefore it
was added that it may be well with the / Deutero. v.
and that thou maysthe long lived upon the land which the lord shall give to
the. And it is very lykely / that many persons of that people to whom that
law was given / did never come to the land yt was promised to the^ / which yet
for all yt had used due honor and love toward their parents. But those me^
which done spiritually judge spiritual things do not look for ye reward of
virtue and keeping of gods percept here in this world: but they wait after
their reward in that land of living people / for it can not be well with him /
that lives evil and ungraciously / and this life although it be continued and
prolonged even unto extreme age: yet is it not for all yt a life of long time /
but rather a moment and a point of time / if it be compared to that
everlasting life. who has be^ verilye long living.
That man has lived a long season / who so ever has with well doing here /
deserved the eternal life / and who so ever being brought to an end in short
season / has fulfilled many times / how be it even in this life also god
oftentimes does pay the reward of loving obedience and honor used
toward the parents / it is some part of reward / an honest fame or name. For
even the commune sort and most part of hethen folk also does hate and
abhor them / which do not regard their progenitoures / and which done cast
them into heaviness and discomfort. And it is communely seen to come pass that
as every man has used and behaved himself toward his father and mother /
even so do his children use and demean theyrselues toward him / neither is
there any greater or more grievous calamite / that may happen to a man: than to
have wicked and unnatural or unkind children. And vnkyndues deseruethe / that
the thing / which a man has received vndeseruyng he shall lose and forgo
again not willing. we are detters for our life to our progemtoures and
parents / toward whom if we be kind: it is right and reason / that we
should long enjoy that / which we have taken or received. And yet are not
those men disceyued of the thing here promised them / to whom it chauncethe
not to live long here in this world. For either this thing is given / which
is here promised according to the lettre / or else some thing much more
excellent and better than it / for that man does not disceyue and break
promise / which promisyng glass does give a preciouse stone. By these.iiii.
precepts we are warned and taught / that we should be kind toward them that
have done us good / and also that we should do good unto them / toward whom
we do after a certain manner represente the person of god. Now to repress the
gross malice of the Jews / those things are expressly forbyden / by which one
man hurts another man. The.v. precepte.
Of all injuries the most heinous and gre^ous is manslaughter / how be it in
the name of manslaughter are contained and under stonded all affections or
passions / by which we do go toward manslaughter / of the which the first
greece or step is wrat ^conceyued in the mind / and hatred. what wrath is.
wrath is a sorrow or grefe desyryng greatly wroke or vengeance. Hatred.
Ha^tred is old roted wrath / an affection or passion at every occasion ready
to hurt. wrath is the more vehement passion or grefe as being of a fresh raw
wound: but hatred is the more incurable of the two. Envy.
Envy is worse than they both / which does interpret and judge another
man's felicite and wealth to be her own injury and hurt. The next degree or
step is wrath breakyng out into a voice or sound of indignation / which
voice our lord in the gospel calls Racha. Math. v. Racha.
The third degree is grefe breakyng out into a manifest and open raylynge or
reuilynge word: as wha^ we say. Thou sole / Among men / that man is accused of
manslaughter / which has taken away the life from his neighbor. Before god /
he is a man queller: who so ever ha^eth his neighbor / that is to say /
bears evil will toward him / and would him harm / for we are angry or
misco^tented even with those persons also / to whom we owe benevolence and good
will: not to the intent that we would hurt them / but that we might amend
the^: and we do hate in a man not that thing which god has made: but that
thing which he himself has made. The false accuser and ye pykequarel instead
of a swerd / of a darte / and of poison uses his tongue to kill men with all. The
covetous man / whiles he does not succurre and releue his nedy and hungry
neighbor: kylleth him with famen / for he doutles does kill: He kylleth that
may save and will not.
whosoever does not save / when he may save. Peradventure his neighbor does
not dye: what tha^^ yet as much as in him is: which did not help him in his
necessite / and wha^ he was in ieoperdy: he is killed and dead. witches do
kill men with enchaunteme^tes. The backbyter and slaunderour drives men to
death / it forces not / how or by what means one takes away his
neighbors life. where so ever is a froward and maliciouse mind to hurt / there
is manslaughter. women which with medicines provoke castyng of their child
before ye due time: done commit infant slaughter Those persons which with
slau^drouse books done rail on any man / apparyng his good fame: done kylle
and slay with their pen. D. If it be no manner way lawful to kill or slay /
what shall we say of wars / and of open judgments? M. In lawful and
ryghtful judgments / it is ye law self yt kills / and not ye judge. Now ye
law is of god / which commands one membr^ to be taken away for the health and
sau^ guard of the whole body / but yet sur^geones and leches do not fall to
cut^tyng / as long as there is by any other way hope to recover health / A
similytude between a judge or a prince and a surgeone.
so lykewys^ it belongs to a christian judge or princ^ and ruler / not to come
unto the ponys^shement of death / except he have fyrst^ assayd all other ways
/ and when non^ otherway will help be compelled thereunto. A notable sentence.
He that judges corruptelye / o^ which mysuseth the laws applyeng^ them and
making them serve to his own pryuate hatrede or aduauntage^ although the
malefactoure be worthy death / yet does the judge commyt manslaughter. Of war.
As touching war / wha^ shall I say? would god that all men did so abhor
wars / as though it were parrycidye there to kill any man / in as much as
every christen man is brother to other. But in a battle ryghtfully be gonne
and lawfully made / the law does kill / and not man. Nota.
But the prince / which begynnethe war not of nece^site / no^ for the love
and favor of the co^mun^ weal / but for his own pryuate affections / he
does commit so many mu^^dres or manslaughters / as there be men that either
done dye in that battle / or else driven to starve for hunger. Add this
moreover / who so ever either for hatred / or for hope of pray / does run to
battle / although he does slay no body / yet is he a ma^queller / for there
wanted not will: but there wanted to the will power or occasion. DIS. A notable
question.

Auns^^re.


what if a private person bearing none office / does kill one that inuadeth
him / in his own defense? MAG. If sure and undoubted death be threttened him /
and there be no way to avoid or escape: I would counsel him / that is a
per^yte man har^ely to desire and call for help of god / which is oftentimes
more nerer at hand / than we do believe / seeing tha^ we do read / that even a
dragon being wakened with the cry of him of whom she had in times before
passed ben fed and nouryshed / has run unto him / and delyueryd him from
thieves. Nota.
In this case if he had lever to be killed / than to kill: I would judge that
he has done the office and duetye of a christen man. But to that / that it
might be lawefull for a man to save his own life / by killing of his
adversary / that ^ls would slay him: many things are required / whi^che to
pursue and speak of here / it is no point of our present purpose. DIS^ what
say you of them that fordon^ theyrselues? M A. If they be not men^ they do not
commit manslaughter. I except only such disease of the mind / which takes
away reason and all judgment. DIS. what of them which done either kill
themselves / or shorten their own life with fastings / watchynges / cold /
nakedness / and such other ponyshynges of the body? MAG. If hypocrisy be
joined thereto: they are manquellers. If their mind be pure: their offense is
the lyghter / namely i^ they do excede measure / for desire to help their
neighbor. For charity excuses many things. Charity excuses many t^ynges.
The most heinous and cruel injury against our neighbor is manslaughter.
Next to it is adultery / The vi. commandment.
for as unto the husbonde there is no thing joined more nere / nor more dearly
beloved / than is his lawful wife: so is there none injury more intolerable /
than the defylynge of his wife by adultery. And all be it that adulterare in
the Latyne tongue / and likewise mo^cheuein in the Greek tongue / is a word
general to all manner of corruptyng (for both he is said / adulterare monet am
/ which corrupts the coin / and also they are said adulterare verbumde^ /
which done handle the word of god not syncerly but with corrupt mind and
affection) yet for all that the more often and common use has applied this
word to the breakyng and violatynge of wedlock / by the unlawful fleshely
dealyng of man and woman to gether. Neither done they say anusse / which do
think by this commandment to be forboden all manner unlawful use of fleshely
pleasure / of which sort are inceste / both outward and spiritual / buggerie
/ fleshely medlyng with spirits or brute beasts / all vnclennes^e or
pollution / finally single fornication / which is so the lyghtest and smallest
offense in this kind: Single for^^catio^ is other whiles by reason of the
circumstances more gre^ous offense: than aduoutrie.

The husbo^d may committee adultery with his own wife.


that yet otherwhyles by the reason of the circumstances / it is made more
great and grievous offense tha^ aduoutrie / ye more over even in lawful
matrimony also is com^itted adultery if they do vnmeasurably serve their
fleshely appetite and lust / or if they deal together after such fashyon /
that of that act there be no hope of child to be begotten.

Spirytuall adultery.
They add also hereunto spiritual adultery / which is committed in every
deadly sin / but most specially in apostasy / when any man gothe away from
the worshyppyng of very god / unto the honourynge of the deuylles / whereof we
have spoken in the first precepte. Now considre me the convenient and comely
order. The co^uense^t order of the commandments.
The.iii. first precepts done appertain to god: than whom nothing is better
/ or more to be loved. The.iiii. precept appertains to the parents / to
whom most honor is due next after god. The.v. appertains to the life and
body / which is the dearest and best beloved possession / that every man
has. The syxte precept concernyth the wife / which is one flesh with her
husbond. The.vii. appertains to the out ward goods / but yet without which
we can not live / wherefore he that spoyleth or robs a pore man of his
necessaries: as much as in him is / he takes away his life from him / for of
those did a certain hethen poet say very truly / Hesiodus.
that money is the life unto sely wretched men. Furtu^ in Latyne / theft in
Englysh: are general words and commune to many things.
And the name of theft / which in Latyne is called furtum / is a general
word unto them / that steals out of the common treasurehouse / which are
called peculatores / and unto them that commit sacrilege / by taking away
hallowed or holy things / to them that stealen away other men's sheep or
catayle / which in the Latyne tongue are called Abigei / unto those that
stealen away other menes servants or children which are called plagiarn /
unto rouers on the sea / and those that rob men by violence / and after a
certain form of battle / which are called pirate and predones / and to them
that done privily take away other me^nes goods / and these kinds of theft
are known to every man: but these that folowe^ are in deed more close and
secret / but yet as mystheuouse and as synnefull as the other because I will
not say more myscheuous and more synnefull. DIS. which be those? MAG. Points
of theft / but not so named.
He that defraudeth his hiered servant of his due reward / in deed he is not
called a theffe / but he is a thief in very deed. Nota.
He that boroweth any thing / or receives any thing deliuerid to him of trust
/ to keep or keeps it with such mind and purpose / that if he might / he
would never restore it: he is no less a thief / than is he which breaks up
another man's cofres / and so takes away another man's goods. Likewise the
workman / which either does not perform that which he has promised / or
which is.x. days of fynishyng that thing / which he might have fynished and
made an end of in.v. days: if he does take his whole reward he is a thief. As
for such persons / which by craft done appayre and worsen the co^mun^ coin:
what needs it to speak of them? Or what needs it to speak of disceyuers /
which done sell countrefayte stones instead of very natural precious stones /
or which with some other like disceyte done beggar their neighbor? Or what
of merchaunt men / which do sell their wares not for so much as they ought /
but as dear as they can? They call it lucre or gaynes: but in very deed it is
theft. The same thing is to be said of them / that done engrosse and bye up
any kind of wares whole i^to their own hands to the end that they may sell
it as they list. Neither can it excuse tauerners or wynesellers and carters /
because it is gone into a commune custom / that they do sell water mengled
with brymstone / or lee instead of wine. Neither are myllers / bakers / and
taylers / which done either steal / or corrupt and stroye another man's
thing / therefore no thieves: because it is a thing customably done of very many
men. Certain men do join hereu^^o clerks and prestes / which done rece^^^
and take the stipendes and renies of ^^e church: and do not fare about to
do those things / for which such lyuynges were instituted and ordained. Or
else such as take the fruits and profytes of a benefyce: and have no minds to
be prestes. Brefly it is theft / what so ever thou shall be compelled to
restore / if thou be of habilite and power / for he is a thief also / which
robs any man of his good name / and also who so ever with craft and
sub^elte does corrupt the simple mind of a young damoysell. There rests
behind three precepts / of which the first restrayneth and holds back the
tongue / the other two the concupiscence and lust or desire of the mind / and
they are rather declarations of certain of them that are heretofore reherced:
The.viii. commandment.
than new precepts / for if he that hurts his neighbor with false
witness / does it for love of lucre and advantage: it appertains than to
the vii. precepte of theft. If he does it for hatred / than appertains it
to the.v. precept of manslaughter. Now so great was the grosnes of that people
of the Jews / that they did believe / that there was no manslaughter / but that
which was done with an iron weapon or a staff / and yet is the tongue more
noysom and hurtful than any weapon of yerne and stele. The tongue is more noysom
tha^ any weapon.
Neither is it much amysse or against reason / likewise as under the name of
of manslaughter is comprehended all manner hurtynge of the neighbor: even so
under the name and title of false witness all manner hurt and damage to be
contained / which we do to our neighbor by the mean of our tongue / but
Moses did put a notable and a great exau^ple / for false witness does
comprehend also perjury / for in the old time both the judges were sworn
that did examine and take knowledge of any matter / and the witnesses also were
sworn / that made answer. And he does no less kill a man / which oppresses
an innocent person with false witness: than does he that sl^eth with a sword.
Neither is he any whytte less a robber or a thief / which puts his
neighbor from his goods by corrupt judgment or false witness: than is he
/ yt spoyleth him by open robberye. The mind and purpose is al one. The will
is all one / only the instrument is changed. Upon this rock done all those
stryke their ship which either by back bytyng or flateryng / or by crafty
counsaylles / or else by corrupt doctrine / done hurt his neighbor / which
things the more that they are contrary unto christian charity: by so much
they do come nerer unto deadly sin. The.ix. and the.x. precept Exodi.xx.
The other two precepts are put jointly both to gether. In Exodi in this wise.

Thou shall not desire the house of thy neighbor / neither shall thou desire
his wife / nor his servant / nor his handemayde / nor his ox / nor his ass /
nor any of all the things that are his. In Deuterono. they are put in this
wise. Thou shalt not desire the wife of thy neighbor / not his house / not
his land / not his bondsman not his ha^dmayde / not his ox / not his ass / nor
any of all the things yt do belong to him / If thou do separate and depart
the concupiscence and desire of the wife / from the concupiscence of the other
possessions: than shall they be two commandments / of the which the
foremore appertains to adultery / the lattermore unto theft. D. What needs
these two commandments? Does not he that forbid the an evil deed: in so
doing forbid also an evil will and an evil desire? MA. This thing was done
because of the rudeness and grosnesse of that people / which because there
was no penaltye set or appointed by the law unto a lewd and ungracious
desire: would else have believed / that that thing had been no sin before god
which is vnponished among men / not for that it is no sin: but for that
man's thought is moveable and often tournynge / and the deed may be proved /
but the will is known only to god. why the desire of perjury and of murdre
were not expressly forbidden.
D. But why was not concupiscence or desire expressly mentioned and spoken of in
the precept or commandment that forbyddeth perjury and manslaughter? MA.
There are some men that do make answer in this wise / that the affection and
the desire of fleshely pleasure / and the desire of having / that is to say /
lecherye and covetousness are more inwardly roted in all men by nature: than are
the desire of perjury and manslaughter / for from these we do abhor rather
unless it be so / that a violent desire and passion does oppress the
judgment of nature. But the nation of the Jews was more enclyned to
ve^geau^ce tha^ unto fleshely lust / and therefore it was permitted them to
give a lettre of diuorcement. Deute. xxiiii.
But as me seems (that I may say my mind without any man's grefe or
displeasure) Concupiscence How concupiscence is taken in these.ii. precepts.
here in this place does not so much signifye what so ever manner desire of
another man's wife or of another man's possession / as it does betoken the
enforcement or endeavor and going about to do an evil deed (Likewise as we
are said in the Latyne tongue appetere aliquem insidus / not for that we have
hurt him / but for that by worky^ge traynes and lyeng in wayet / we have gone
about to hurt him) but that gross people would have judged it to be no sin /
the atte^ptyng of auoutrie / and the going about to do theft / unless it
were also brought to pass / and done in very deed / for ^ls not every desire
is strayghtwayes sin / as for exaumple / if a man do desire to wedde a woman
to his wife / if it should chance her husbonde to decease / or if ^ man did
couete and desire another man's possession to be made his own / by gift or
by purchase. Neither is every theft ponyshed with death / neither every
endeuourment and attemptynge of adultery / for men are not ponyshed / except
they be taken in the deed doing. But manslaughter committed is ponyshed with
death / and the attemptyng of it / or ye going about to do it / draws a man
into danger and peril of judgment. For this cause is concupiscence expressly
forbyden in those things / in which the only attemptyng is not ponyshed. Here
I do see certain men to have labored about this yt he might reduce all
precepts either byddyng or forbyddyng any thing to be done unto these.x.
commayndementes before reher^ced / and they do refer every one of the kinds
of deadly sins (which are accounted.vii. in noumbre) to some one of these
precepts / but with diligence verily more busye than earnest. For after this
manner there is made a confusion and menglyng to gether of all the precepts all
are comprehended under one precept and otherwhyles again one and the same are
comprehended under diverse precepts. Besides this seeing that these laws were
given to the vplandyshe and rude unlearned people (and a law ought to be plain
/ clear / and open) how could the Jews suspecte or deem / that under the name
of adultery is forbyden all manner stupre and fornication / though it be never
so single? or else that under the title and name of manslaughter is forfended
all manner malice or evil will? Nota.
It is therefore after my mind the more simple and plain way / to say / that
these.x. commandments were given to the intractable and stourdy people / as
first rudime^tes or principles / that they should not fall into all vices and
sins / but that from these first principles and begynnynges they should
profit and goo foreward unto the other precepts which are innumerable both
in the law / and also in the prophets / and also in the proverbs of Solomon
/ until they might come unto the evangelical perfection / whereof certain
both exaumples and also counsayles and commandments are contained also even
in the books of the old testament. And therefore our lord the best
interpretour and expositour o^ the law / answers to the young man in this
wise. If thou wyl^ enter unto life: Math. xix.
observe thou and keep the commau^^dementes / showing that the.x.
commandments of the law are the beginning and first entering in unto
godlynes / but not perfyte religion and holiness. But for as much as thou in
this communication playest the part of one that is ignorant and an infau^t:
it is right and reason that thou be content in the mean season with these
rudimentes and first instructions. The pater noster.
There rests now behind prayer / whereof the best form and manner is that /
which our lord himself has prescribed and taught to us. Math. viii.
And likewise as Peter when he did professe^ Christ to be the son of the
living god / spoke in the name of all the apostles: Math. xvi.
even so he that does say the creed / does pronounce and speak it i^ the
voice of the whole church^ For it is one and the same faith or believe of all
christen men. Likewise who so ever makes his prayer according to the form
and manner taught of our lord: he does pray in the voice of the whole church.
This thing is very well showed and betokened by those pronownes. Nobis / nos et
nostra.i. ws / we^ and owers. Prayer with out faith and charity: is vain and
unfruitful.
And prayer is unfruitful and in vain: if faith and charity be not present.
Faith gives boldness and trust. Faith.
Charity gives heat and feruoure / for who so ever douteth or distrusteth:
Charity.
does not believe him that said / what so ever thing you shall ask of my
father in my name: he will give it you. And who so ever is without charity: yt
man prays fayntly / and he prays more for himself / than for other men.
But as there is but one spirit of all the sons of god so do they all pray
with one voice for each one particular person / and each particular person
prays for all the whole multitude / calling upon their heavenly father / to
whom they are by Christ new borne again / that his name might be glorified
and honored thoroughe out the whole world / that all men might rejoice and
boste of their commune father / and no man of himself / that the tyranny of
sin being expulsed: his spirit might raygne in that likewise as in that
heavenly city there is no rebellion against god: even so in this city or
communaltye labourynge and enforcyng it self unto the similitude and likeness
of it / and being ordained and appointed to the inheritance of it / all
operations and works may be disposed and ordered according to the will and
pleasure of that most high and sovereign father and ruler / in which particle
and perceyll is showed both the reward and also an exaumple / for who so ever
does in earth repress and subdue his own will / and does obey the will of
god / goes straight way to the heavenly life / where is no strife or battle at
all / nor any rebellion. And the children done in the mean season here in this
life (which is a continual war fare) desire none other wages or vittayl than
that their captain will give unto them the meat and nouryshement or fode
both of the mind and of the body / that they may be strong and able to do
their offices and duetyes stoutly and manfully. They do not desire honors not
riches / not pleasures of this world / not treasures / they do only d^syre
things necessary ^o the life of the body / and to the health and sauegarde of
the soul / for these things are comprehended under the name of daily bread.
The. v.
And to the end that there might be full and perfyte concord both between the
father and sons / and also between the brethern selves one with another of
them / they do pray and desire / that he will forgive the humayn trespasses /
without which men do not live in this world / which thing they are not
wyllyng to obtain except theyrselues / by forgyuenge each other the offenses
and trespasses committed among them / shall have provoked the mercy and
gentylnes of their father toward themselves / for it is against all right and
reason to desire that god being offended and displeased should forgive man / if
one man being much less and more sleyghtly offended / will not forgive
another man. The. vi. and.vii.
Finally and last of all / whiles they do considre and remember how benign a
lord they have and how loving a father which has given his own only
begotten son unto the death to the end that he might ransom and deliver them
from the tyranny of the devil / they do pray that they may not by his
suffra^ce be brought again into the power of that wicked fend / and so be
drawn into temptation that they should deserve to be disherited of their good
father. DIS. Who do they not desire everlasting life? why in the pater noster /
there is not desired everlasting life.
MA. Because it belongyth to good soldyers / only to do the offices and
busynesses / which their captain has commanded and appointed them: taking
no thought or care for their reward / and it is the propretie of good children
to labor and endeavor theyrselues hereunto only / that they may have their
father well contented and favorable and loving to them: taking no manner care
for their inheritance namely seeing when that they have such manner a father /
than whom there is none more tych / none more good and liberal / none more
true of promise. Of the Pa^er noster I will make no longer process at this
time. That paraphrase upon the pater noster is translated into english by one
of M. Mo^^ daughters.
There are commentaries and expositions upon it made by right holy and well
learned men ready and ethe to come by and specially of sayncte Cyprian If thou
will take the labors to read the paraphrase which I made upon it many years
ago: thou shall together both pray / and also in prayenge learn the form
and manner of prayeng / at the least wise this profit thou shall attain and
get thereby (except I be begyled) that thou may come somewhat the more
instruct and prepayred unto the reading of those commentaries and books /
which I spoke of before.

Thus ends the dialoge / called the instruction of the christen faith made
by the most famous Clarke M. Erasmus of Roterdame.
