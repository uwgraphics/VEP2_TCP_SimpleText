OBIECTORVM REDVCTIO: OR, Daily Employment for the Soul.

In Occasional Meditations upon several Subjects.

By Donald Lupton.

1 Timothy 4. 14. Despise not the gift that is in thee. LONDON, Printed by JOHN
NORTON, for JOHN ROTHVVELI, at the sign of the Sun, in Paul's Churchyard,
1634.

TO THE RIGHT Honorable LORD, George Earl of Rutland, Baron Roos of Hamelake,
Belvoir, and Trusbutt, Increase of Honor, and Happiness, temporal, and
eternal.
My LORD,
REligious, and Real goodness establish Greatness: ^^thout these Supporters,
Mole ruit sua. Let Virtue keep Court within and Honor will atten^ the outward
Man.

Clouds cannot long obscure that Sun which moves directly. As Good^nes make
all men Honou^rable, so it makes the^ Conspicuous. Thos^ whose Actions are
pi^^ous, will be Eminent i^ Place, and Person. The firmest Basis for Honor to
mount upon, is Practi^call Virtue. Indirec^ and Oblique Ascen^ may be more
speedy, and early, but they are subject to sudden, and certain Praecipices,
those which are Raisd upon Virtue are durable, and permanent. Others may shine
sooner, but these surer, and longer. Those are as blazing Meteors, these as
fixed Stars.

I know (my Lord) your Intendments this way to be Methodicall. So that your
Actions are warrantable directions to others, and I in avouching your Honor to
be truly Noble, cannot Justly b^ censured for a Parasite.

The knowledge of this, and the Experience of your Honors Candide disposition,
gives me Encouragement to present my Work to your Tuition. I know your Honors
delight is to be a Lord Protector of Virtuous Endeavors. Comfort it may be to
you, disparagement it cannot be. It shows your Affection to Learning, and
Religion, truly preserves your Memory sacred to Posterity, and gives courage
to the Heart of the Labourer, even to future undertakings.

That Reverend L. Bb. of Exon.
Father in our Church, first began to enter this Path, and sent his Labors to
the World for a pattern, under the Protection of a Right Honorable Patron.
His Exhortation was my Incitation, I am beholden to him for Method, but the
Matter was mine own. What is thus mine by right of Compo^sing, I entreat your
Honor to make yours by way of Patronage and Protection.

Thus your Honor, One of the Worthies of Israel, in our Salomons Court, shall
have the Prayers of him, who desires to be, and is,

Your Honors Servant, Donald Lupton.

DAILY Employment for the Soul.
MEDITATION. 1.
Upon the sight of a JEW.
WHat have I, or this Man, in Us? that He should be rejected, received. It
might seem ^o have been as easy to have kept him In who was In, as to place
me In who was Out. But who dare dis^like, what the high Court and Parliament of
Heaven hat^ pleased to enact. Thou are a good (O God) in thy Iusti^ as in thy
mercy. If his fa^ be my rising, the number o^ thy Elect is still certain. ^
see it is more necessary t^ have Jesus Christ our Brother then only Abraham to
b^ our Father: that covenant^ Circumcision must be crown by that of Faith. If I
ha^^ his seat in the Church g^^ven to me, who was, and as yet excommunicate for
(...) coming there; Who (...) or dare accuse the Lord that Court for unjust: I
desire heartily of God to make him my Pew-fellow, let him see his error, and be
joynd to the glorious Assembly of the Saints. God excluded none who first did
not exclude themselves, We all are bound and I do heartily pray, that all
Israel may come In. My perfection and theirs shall be together, hasten both (O
Lord,) and make the Children of Abraham and Christ all one in the unity of the
same Spirit, and the same Faith.

MEDITATION. 2.
Upon PILATE, washing his Hands.
SEe how this Roman Deputy seems to affect innocence, He will appear to be
though he will not be a sincere Judge, While he washes his hands, He pollutes
his heart. What a vain folly was it to dippe in water, to swim in blood?
What a strange delusion was this? to seem the cleaner, to be the fo^ler.
Outward pretenses may, and are often void of sincerity. Many Roman Pharisees
do often sprinkle themselves in Holy water, yet under this wallow in the blood
of Princes, and Gods weaker members, and so many Hypocrites amongst us under
the form of sanctity commit the deepest and desperatest impieties. The worst
complexions, and sordidst natures are deepliest pain^ed. The grosser villainies
have the fairer excuse. That great Imposter when He means worst, appears as
^n Angel of Light. We ^^e not to rely upon appearances, I desire not to ^ash
with him, I had rather have a clean Heart and foul Hands, then clean. Hands
and a soul Heart. Praestat esse^quam ^ideri.

MEDITATION. 3.
Upon the sight of a Toade.
Which of us tiro are of the Ancienter House? the Earth is our mother. This
creature may plead antiquity of nature, I of sin. My original Polution makes
this so loathsome to the sight. I am beholden to it, for* bearing so patiently
some part of my burden. By nature I am as full of poison as It. Every sin is
not only venomous, but mortal. In my corrupted nature, I do appear in the
Eyes of God as ugly as this deformed beast. It would perhaps be better if it
could; I may be, if I will. This creatures deformity comes from me; mine from
my self and Satan. How am I beholden to that God, that did not, though he
justly might have made me so. How am I bound to praise Him, who to make me
comely, lets the whole creature suffer under vanity. Romans 8.

MEDITATION. 4.
Upon hearing a Woman to die in childbed.
THE unlawful desire to taste fruit, made her di^ in bearing fruit. Eves sin
procurd her suffering. The opening her womb is a preparative to her grave. It
may well be called a Travail when the Mother takes her journey out of the
World. I see truly what a dangerous thing it is to conceive and breed sin.
St. James spoke true, That sin when it is conceived brings fort^death.
Children (I think) have good cause to love their Parents who are willing to
part with life themselves to give it these. How ought ^ve then ( O Savior) to
love thee, who to give us eternal life was so willing to lay down thine own
life in the grave. And in the case of regeneration, so must every Child of God
do. His body must die wholly to sin, that soul and body may live wholly unto
righteousness, unto glory. The only way to live hereafter, is to die here.

MEDITATION. 5.
Upon SAVLS going from Heirusalem to Damascus.
VVHither posts this deepe-learnd Pharisee with such Eagernes and Zeal? did
Gamaliel his T^tor ever read such a Lecture of bloody persecution to him? where
found he this Axiom in the whole Law to persecute the Gospel? where learnt he
ever to make Mose fight against Christ? Could he so deeply love the Servant and
yet kill the Master. Al^ knowledge and Religion in ^^y professor is but zeal
blin^d without Christ. It may ^eme strange that the Professors of Divinity
should ^ave such ^arres and so deep^^ uyed. Behold! the great ^oodnes of God.
In the depth of darkness* Saul is caught and compassed with the great ^^ght of a
glorious Savior. We ^re not masters of our Own ^houghts, It was a true ^peech
of Joseph, ye thought ^ill but God brought it to Good. When we think many
times to do most, ^ee then cannot do any thing. I see it is vain figh^ing
against the Church of Christ. God does well know ^ow to catch a Sinner at
ad^antage. Even all thing persecution it self work for the good of Gods Saint
He began his Journey Saul. But ends it a Paul. (...) if I be asked where Saul
(...) I may safely answer. Is (...) Saul now among the Prophet and Apostles
blessed for Ever.

MEDITATION. 6.
Upon DAVID'S Adultery.
IS it not pity such a Ros^ should have such a Canker? so fair a face such a
Blemish? But what Saint is privileged with the state ^f Perfection here? This
^^ll (as it proved) was but for is surer standing, better ^eed taking. The
greatest ^^enesit (I see) that God ^nds to recover Him, is a ^od Sermon
preached, and Well ^pplyed by a Worthy and well ^arned Prophet. send (O God)
such always (upon ^eed) in the Courts of earth^y Princes. They deserve there
^laces with reverence, with ^espect. No Member of Christ can expect a Freedom
from tentation* Our head ^ad his trialls, and those ^harpe ones too, by that
wick^d One. the fairest Sun sometimes meets with Clouds. So the purest
lights of the Church want (...) their blemishes (O God^ let not me so much
(...) that he fell, as rejoice (...) he did in time recover. (...) me look
well to my self For I may be sure, that if S^tan durst invade such a religious
Crown. He will not (...) the weaker subject. The be^ course to keep out Satan
to avoid idleness.

MEDITATION. 7.
Upon CAINS murther^ his brother A^^L.
What? but two ^^thr^n in a who^ World? and they together (...) the ears.
What Is the ^uarrell? for wealth? or ho^^o^? the one was not known, ^he other
not affected. Was (...) religion? this would have ^aught Cain love, not
revenge. This was an early persecution, ^he devil began War be^imes;
goodness can no soo^^er be begun, but it shall ^^eete with opposition. We must
not loose our religion, though we bleed for it by our (...) brethren; All in a
family (...) not the children of the (...) father, Grace is not tied (...) the
firstborn. God may ^hoose the youngest, leave the ^ldest. Cain scorns to
hate under bloodshedding. The devil is a murderer from the beginning.
Brethrens divisions especially in matters of Religion are hardly reconciled,
But though this one dies, God knows how to bring up another, goodness shall be
sure of Enemies but it cannot be utterly rooted out. Abell has had abundance
of brethren, Cai^ did not so much kill Abeas himself. It is a true Maxim that
Sanguis m^^rti^rum semen Ecclesiae. S. (...) shall conclude it in thi^ saying.
That he that (...) borne after the flesh persec^^ted him that was borne afte^
the Spirit.

MEDITATION. 3.
Upon the good Samaritan and the wounded Man.
SEe how we poor wretches are beset with dangers, our life is but a con^inued
passage through robbers and Free booters. It Is the safest to keep our selves
at home. When we go forth; we expose our selves to hazards. It Is not every
Man's happiness to have such a compassionate Passenger. That man lives safe whose
mind keeps within. A retired life has the fewer inconveniences. This Man
found most good at the hands o^ a stranger. A friend is more Near then a
brother. It is grace not nature, affection not affinity that are most sensible
and sympathizing of distresses. I see plainly that those Jewish ceremo^nies
are not so Helpful, as the mercies of God in Jesus Christ, It Is not the Eye
(...) the passenger but the heart which does good to miseries. I do desire to
keep home, but if thou (O God) shall be pleased to employ in public, either
protect* me from these spiritual murderers, or send me speedily such a
comfortable Physician.

MEDITATION. 9.
Upon Demas leaving Saint Paul.
What a poor conditioned truant was this having such a good master. It was a
miserable sequel of instruction Apostolical to forsake God and go to the
Devil, upon what warrant, did he ground himself to be so suddenly besotted
with the lust of so base a strumpet? Where had he this posture to turn
temporiser? Was it fear of any Persecution? What made he then in that
Spiritual warfare^ if blows would daunt him? did he suppose this present
world the safer or the sweeter? why then did he so Hypocritically join to tha^
Heavenly Doctor in Divinity^ what made he in this College if he did not intend
to proceed? His non Proficiency is an Argument of weakness. And the leaving of
this society, argues enough to prove him an idiot. And such is every one that
leaves Heaven for Earth. How many have been, and are sick of this malady: The
natural man's faith, is his sense, and his Present Possessions are his Heaven.
He prefers the things that are seen before those that are not, for want of
faith. I would he had been the first and the last of this nature; I pray thee
(O God) to weane my heart from covetousnes. And since thou have pleased to
admit me into the school of grace, let me so order my affections that I
always may be a Student of that society.

MEDITATION. 10.
Upon the two Disciples going from Jerusalem to Emaus.
SEe what may fall out by the way. I do verily suppose when these two began
there journey, they little thought to have had such a good Companion to have
gone along with them. But God takes his advantageous opportunities. There
discourse is political, yet fearful; commendable from the subject, they
talked on; relishing of distrust, from the party they spoke too. Its not safe
opening the Closet of our hearts to every Traveller, we may lend our ears and
our tongues to many whom we will not trust with our hearts. (O God) I do
entreat thee in all places let my words be such as relish of sanctification. In
the high way upon my journeying; as well as at other times, good society makes
tedious things seem pleasant, and is a Whetstone to give an edge to a doubting
soul. Thou do (O Savior) allow us wisdom with the Serpent, as well as
innocence with the Dove: we may safely discourse of thee, but we must not deny
thee: our policy must not exclude our faith. I do entreat thee to take that
advantage of every one that doubts of that high point of thy resurrection, or
his own, as to catch him and confirm his wavering heart in that point of
faith. Lodge thou Oh Savior in my soul, so I shall know thee truly, and raig^
with thee eternally.

MEDITATION. 11.
Of a Dog in a Chain.
THe malice of this Crea^ture is great, but it (...) wisely limited. His poner,
and his will are not proportionable; though being chain^^ he cannot bite with
his teeth yet his barking shows what he would do at liberty. Admirable is
that divine Power of God limitting, permitting that great Dog of Hell^ when
he persecutes by bonds imprisonment, and captivity* then he bites sore: when he
slanders, reviles, and envies, then he sn^rles, and barks only. If God
should not permit this Curre, few would fear his justice: if he should not
limit him, many would question his mercy. It shall be my comfort to know that
my greatest Enemy is at my Fathers disposing: if I be barked at, or sorely
bitten, I know it is his malice, and Gods permissive Will, I will not fear
him, though I will endeavor to shun him. Sennacherib was a whelpe of this
litter, let loose, but suddenly pulled In again; he may be to warn me, not to
worry me: He shall speed never the better though God (...) him. I do not much
griev^ that there is such a Dog nor do I much fear hi^ breaking loose, being
s^ strongly chaind by such a wise master. My prayer to God shall be, to tie him
up shorter, and I could wish h^ were always musled, but Gods will be done.

MEDITATION. 12.
Upon a beautiful and pure Virgin.
Who would think that corrupted Nature could send forth such ^ rich jewel to
the world. How seemly and decently is very Part proportioned; that a curious
Tabernacle, ^s here wrought by the will ^f Heaven, how gloriously And richly
covered, while many others either want this resplendancy, nor counterfeit it by
impostures, and paintings, give me that ^^all not adulterate; native, not
artifici^ll beauty, No Ague, Aches, diseases, have as yet seizd upon, or
impaired her Perfections: Any ^^genious and well qualified Spirit desires such
a Mate. How lively an embleame is this of our souls, before either
corruptions, or imperfections have taynt^ them. But she does plain describe
that mystical Virg^^ the Church tryumphan^ which shall be presented t^ her
Husband und^filed, with out any blemishes, spots or wrinkles, all her Part
keep harmony, and decen^cy; she shall be gloriously molded in immortality,
and incorruption; Her covering shall then be the glorious Roabes of her
Husbands righteousness. The Church of Hypocrites, though now in show, and
appearance beautiful, shall then prove but a strumpet; (O God) Hasten that day
of happy union, and let me be but in the remotest and extremest part of that
mystical Body, I shall be sure to taste Joy and Comfort enough.

MEDITATION. 13.
Upon seeing a Man arrested, and carried to Prison.
SEe the power of Law and justice transgressed! That Party broke his ^bond,
wants Bail, and is fallen into the paws of a merciless Creditor. What can
be expected but a full satisfaction, or else a Perpetual imprisonment. It was
no otherwise (O God) with thy Law and thy Iusti^^ by all transgressed, we bro^^
our Bonds, and our Covenants, and so fell into the danger of that great jayler
Satan did plead for a writ^ and an execution at the Bar of thy Justice, and
being sealed turned Serieant and arrested us. We all wanted sufficient Bail,
and were not able to give Satisfaction. This grand executioner seizd upon all.
But (Oh Eternal Savior) we are for ever bound to love thee who of thine own^
mercy and free love diddes^ rescue us from our Creditors hands, by thy merits
paiedst the Debt and set us wholly free, how Careful ^ught we to be to shun
(...) sins, which make us ^ll such desperate Debtors. Oh let me ever be
paying ^hee with thanks, who to ^et me free did willingly ^oe to Prison thy
self.

MEDITATION. 14.
Upon the sight of an Hive of Bees.
I Do not a little wonder at this Commonwealth of Flies. Every one by his
proper diligence in particu^ar, aduances the riches of the state in general.
There are 4. things remarkable (...) this little busie-body. 1. The make no
strangers Deniz i^ 2. They bring home store (...) wealth but transport little
3. They harbor no sluggis^ droanes. 4. They go fort^ well furnished with
wing, an^ sting, for defense, or offense. A good pattern for Nation and
societies of men, happy Republiques where store o^ wealth flows in, but little
goes out: where All are kep^ from idleness, and are well employed, and where
ships go^ forth like Bees, that can up on all lawful occasions, eythe^ fly, or
fight, well stored with Ammunition. It Is no otherwise with the soul of a
faithful Christian. It must not ^^mit of strange Gods, or ^range worship. It
must fetch (...) grace by spiritual labor and diligence. It must hate ^dlenes
as the ruin of it is wel^^are, and when it goes out in ^er spiritual war,
must ^e furnished with the whole Armor of God. I do ^eseech thee (O Go^) to
^ake me a subject of this nature, and a Be in this Hive.

MEDITATION. 15.
Upon a Man's shadow.
I See not this mourning Seruiteur attend my corpse in a Cloudy day, nor in
dark night, Nor when I (...) still in a close study. It (...) only my
attendant in the Sunshine, or in the Moonlight, or else in such plac^ as are
capacious of bo^ these Celestial Candles. (...) plainly see that flatte^ most
follows a prosper^ state. Parasites hide th^e^ heads in dangerous occa^^ons. A
reserved life v^^tuously employed admits (...) such Hang-byes. Men who lives,
and actions are public and courteous, are pester most with such vermin, the
do me this favor, that the make the world believe the I am a substance, or
else ha^ ^t. And this is the state of ^he soul. What is the world? ^he ^lesh?
Wealth? Honor? ^ut mee^e shadows, which ^n perilous times either appear not,
or to no good purpose. He shall be my friend that will be my ^ompanion in a
storm. Prosperity gets followers, but Adversity makes the true distinction of
them. There ^s no trust in such Reeds; ^or he sung truly.

Quem Dies vidit veniens Superbum,
Hunc Dies vidit fugiens Iacentem.
MEDITATION. 16.
Upon the sight of the Rainbow.
THis Bow is bended bu^ without an Arrow, bu^ God has abundance in hi^ Quiver.
He forbear^s to punish, not for want of instruments, but because he i^
patiently merciful. I do^ admire the Maker of it, an^ the faithfulness of his
promise, I may well belee^ him, who has kept hi^ word these five thousand
yeer^^ and upwards. It is usually seen before and after Rain^ when I see it
before, I may ^xpect a shower, not fear a ^eluge: when I see it after Rain,
it does confirm my ^aith, summons my Repen^ance, and does strengthen ^y
obedience. Lord thou ^rt willing to teach us by ^ll means, Thou art so
^indfull in this, and in all other thy promises, that we may safely take them
for ^erformances. Oh then I pray ^hee quickly to show that ^igne of thy Son
coming ^o Judgment.

MEDITATION. 7.
Upon a Winter day.
HOw cold and dark is this season? and how uncomfortable? it is well it is
contracted, and so long a night succeeds, with the hopes of a joyful
Springtide, how diligent is every one to provide w^rme houses, good clothes,
restorative diet, sufficient fuel for the house. How easily in this do I see
that Winters-day of sickness, persecution, and death: withal, I take comfort,
because they are limited; violent they may be, long they cannot be. Sorrow may
endure for Night, but joy comes in ^^e Morning, these Mystical ^oods may be
great, and ^ge horribly, but they shall ^sse over me. This pit of ^eath may be
deep, but it cannot shut his mouth upon ^^e: under I may be, above (...)
shall be. Howsoever my grave shall put a Period to the greatest of these
outward, and temporary sufferings. I know* I shall sleep in rest, until the
joyful day of the ^resurrection, as a glorious Springtime does advance me,
(Lord) I pray thee give me wisdom to provide that Habitation, and Tabernacle
which is eternal, the warm Roabes of Jesus Christ hi^ Righteousness to adorn
me thy Spirit to heat my affection; So I shall be sure that though it be
bitter with me here, it shall be sweet to me hereafter, and since this Winter
day shall come, let i^ not take me unprovided. Conturbatus mundus, Caelum^
se^enum est.

MEDITATION. 18.
Upon the Sun.
THis heavenly Candle is comfortable For his light and heat, admirable for his
beauty and motion; necessary to all the inhabitants (...) the world. He is
wisely, and ^orthily placed, and he keeps his station, and honorably
performs the will of his Master, he moves not ob^iquely, but directly in his
course. It is a great blessing when good men are advanced to preferment. When
Moses, and Aaron-rule the ship of the Church, and Commonwealth, it then goes
safely, stands firm, and fears not winds, or waves. What respect, and
reverence ought the Magistrates of the Church, and Commonwealth to have of
Inferiors. Such glorious lights ought to be much and highly honored; Our
^afety and wel-being comes from them, These keep all the Heavens in an order,
and comely motion. It is a manifest symptom of a diseased Commonwealth, when
these are not esteemed: These are the eye and heart of the body politic. All
inferior members receive comfort from their wisdom. Learn me (Oh God) a
quiet subordination and a conscionable submission to these worthy lights. I see
the Sun gives heat to all. Gods blessings are not to be impropriat. He that
gives to others shall not have the less virtue in Himself. It is usual for
one Candle to light up another. Bonum quo commu^ius, eo meli^*

MEDITATION. 19.
Upon the sight of a Brave new House without Land or Means to it.
I Suppose that stately edifice was situated there for pleasure, and health,
But (...) neither see good furniture within, nor proportionable means without
to mantaine ^t, It has nothing but a fair prospect to move envy, and high
Turrets to show the Pride of the owner, and to expose it to flormes, and
winds, when as yonder little Cottage close by, seems poor and base without,
yet is admirably well furnished with Olive branches within, to comfort the two
aged Parents.

How plainly do I describe beauty, and outward comelines, without any
endowment of the mind, always the fairest face has not the soundest heart,
outward perfections are not a general argument of inward goodness. The Caske^
may be fair, and gilded, yet have poison in stead of pearls within it.
Natural parts at the best are but mere blemishes without Grace.

All is not to be trusted that is fair in show, pride and o^^en^ation may
please the passengers eye. But give me that little low grace of Humility, I had
rather not seem, and be rich, then to seem, and not be so. The one is close
retiredness with content, and safety. The other is only empty formality with
inward vexation.

How many Pharisaicall professors are fair, and pleasing to the eye, yet
rotten at the soul. May I ever profess the power of godliness, and not strive
only to hold the form of it. Real performances of good duties are that which
God looks for, not fained and counterfeit seemings, the one are but high clouds
without water, the other Wel^ full of lively springs. Give^ me an humble heart
full of grace, so I shall be satisfie^ when they shall be emptie^ and shall
have a sure cornerstone, when they shall moulder to rottenes.

Respicit Deus Humiles, reijci^ Superbos. MEDITATION. 20.
Upon the sight of a Butcher, killing a Lamb.
I Cannot but think o^ that saying of St. Paul^ The creature does groan under
the bondage of corruption. How meekly, and patiently It submits to the Knife.
At sight of this, I may say, Ec^e Agnus Dei, who so quietly suffered all the
injuries offered him, and as a sheep before the shearer, so opened he not his
mouth: His adversaries were not so violent, and eager in their thirsting for
his life, as he was ready, and willing to lay it down, and whereas they
thought to conquer him by malice, he did conquer them by meeknes, and mercy.
How different was thy desire from theirs, Thou (O Savior) came to give them
all eternal life, and they hunted with bloody wills to take away life from
thee. I see also the lot and share of all thy holy ones, They are Tanquam oves,
and Agnelli. They are but counted as sheep for the slaughter: Oh Butcherly and
bloody world! will not the blood of that One satisfy thy madness? must thou
needs swim in the blood of his poor members also? persecution even to death is
the portion of Gods children. The head has suffered, and (...) must all look
to follow: all that will live godly in Jesus Christ must suffer persecution:
(Oh God) learn me courage, and chearefulnes in all trials, for thy name sake,
for I know this, if I suffer with thee here, I shall rejoice with thee
here^fter.

Per Crucem Itur ad gloriam. MEDITATION. 21.
upon a Door, turning upon his Hinges.
THis is contented with its own motion. It turns ^ackwards, and forwards
con^tantly: sometime for want of Oil it skreikes, and makes ^n unpleasant
noise; but it will not be gotten of from that motion without violence. In this
see the sinner Habituated and accustomed unto evil courses, can the Black^ore
change his color; or the Leopard his spots? then may he that is accustomed to
evil, do well. How he winds himself from one sin to another, but ends in
the sa^^ Center. Sometimes wea^^ with the motion in one wic^kednes, he turns
to another but his whole life is nothing else but a gally-mophrey of (...)
sins, he moves as in a circle, from ill desires to covetousnes, so to usury,
so on to oppression, then to exaction^ then to grinding the faces of the poor,
and at last eats up Gods people, as if he would eat bread. His remoueals are
but from one evil to a worse, and dies in the highest strain of all impiety.
But perhaps his conscience now and then gals him with horror. Then Satan oils
him with some new pleasure or profit, and (...) keeps him either as fast ^ound
or faster then before. ^here is little or no hopes (...) his ceasing, unless
it be (...) the strong Hammer of ^ods Word preached home (...) his conscience.
Let me (Oh ^od) hate and leave all sin, ^ast I be too soon accustomed (...)
any. I pray heartily that ^ne may bind themselves Apprentises to that unlawful
^rade.

upon the sight of a Sword:
THis defends our persons, (...) and offends our Enemies, use makes it bright.
Vp^^ some occasions the scabbe^ is either the best, or worst pla^^ for it; It Is
terrible in (...) hand of an expert Warriou^ Many should use it, who (...) for
fear, or favor, or both,(...) it rust. Three sorts of (...) ought to use it
discreetly, (...) public Magistrate, the S^^dier, and the Traveller. It ^^so
shows me the nature^ that spiritual word of tru^^ which is the safest Buck^^
and shield for our souls, (...) bodies, in all conflicts (...) combats,
destroys all (...) power, and Armadoes of the Prince of darkness; the ^^ner
it is used, the more exc^^lent it is. The mouth of diligent Prophet shows the
Energie of it. They do ill that debar the use of this weapon to Gods people.
It Is ^ll when 40000. Israelites can scarce have it, or use it rightly, but it is
worse when the Magistrate will not, and when the Prophet cannot handle it.

Lend me courage (Oh my Savior) in my calling and this weapon. So I need not
fear the malice, or multitude, faces, nor forces of those presumptuous
Philistines. Teach thou my Hands to War, and my Fingers to fight, then I need
not question the conquest. If I perish, it is mine own weakness and
cowardice, not the insu^^ficiency of the Instrument's

Upon a virtuous Wife, having many Children.
It Is not Every man's happiness to enjoy such a blessing without fruit, how well
is it with him that has good administered to him in such plentiful, and rare
Models. I am persuaded that her hus^band fears God: For she is promised a
portion only to men of that qualification. He need not fear his Enemies,
because his Quiver is full of these Arrows. It Is well when goodness
multiplies, such Seed cannot be sown too soon, nor spring up too fast.
Sterility is fittest when the womb is not holy. God threatens to give dry
breasts, and barren wombs as a curse to sinful, and disobedient Husbands.

Thy Church (O Savior) is as this virtuous Matron well stored with Daughters,
and Olive branches to adorn the Courts of that new Jerusalem, in her Husbands
Absence how she mournes, how lovingly and patiently she desires, expects, and
prays for his coming, how prudently she governes her family? and how
carefully does she provide for there diet, and sustenance? And just so it is
with thy Syon, Thy long absence makes her seem as a Widow, and how earnestly,
and often has, and does she pray for thy second coming; and I as one of her
youngest sons do cry and pray to see my Fathers presence. Come Lord Jesus,
come quickly.

Upon the sight of a Gras-hopper.
WHere does this Summer singing Soldier, take up his quarter in Winter time?
No man can know from whence he marches, nor whither he retreats. Thus much we
may learn, to be obedient to God, for here is an Army of potent Soldiers
ready furnished to punish where there Lord commands. God has 4. Regiments of
such forceable destroiers, the Locust, the Palmerworme, the Canker, and the
Gras-hopper; These have been always found able and willing to execute
judgment having had their Commission. But what strength or pow^^ can reside in
these poor lit^tle Worms? or what weapon are they able to manage? as^ all
Egypt, and it will tell yo^ with amazement.

It Is good to keep in peac^ with, God, least he arm hi^ Creatures against us.
Go^ can, and does bring great A^^tions to pass by small, an^ weak
Instruments. All ha^^ force enough when He im^ploies them. The Fly, an^ Worm
are as able as the Ly^^

Its not so much to quest^^on with what a man is pu^^shed, as to learn from
who^ and whence it comes, I (...) (Oh God) acknowledge the power in all thy
creatures, (...) thou make me an Example of thy Justice by the least, for
despising their seeming impotencies.

Non in quantitat^, sed qualitate virtus. MEDITATION. 25.
Upon the sight of a dead Man.
TEach us (Oh Lord) so to Number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom, for so soon ^asse we away, and are gone, All flesh (I see) is
Grass, and all the beauty of it is as ^he flower of the field, Thou ^Oh God)
have determined ^he number of our days which we cannot pass. See what
follows the separation of the soul, and body. As long as this Tabernacle
lodged the soul, It was sensible, active, could hear, see, speak, or move,
now that guest is driven forth by the Maker, there is nothing in it, but breeds
loathsomeness.

I plainly see that all confidence in man is vain, and deceitful, we must
all dy^ for sin, but keep me from dying in sin, since I mus^ dye, let me
end in grace, no^ in nature. I descry the nat^^rall man's unfitnes for an^
spiritual exercise, what (...) he perform without Christ And as the body is
dea^ without the soul, so both soul and body without grace, Oh let me always
be as a dead man unto sin, so this death shall end in life, and this
dissolution shall be the only means to have both happily, and gloriously
united.

Mortuus pec^ato, vivus Christo. MEDITATION. 26.
Upon the sight of a Lottery.
HOw cunning the world is to deceive the world? here are a thousand Blankes for
one Prize. The World deals all upon cheating, It Is a thousand to one if any
good man gets any good by it, from it, or in it. See what a throng is here,
Every man strives to be first to cheat, and deceive himself. I do see places
of more profit, and pleasure stand empty.

The world has more Clyents then the Church, we cannot conclude the greatest
company to be the best. Goodness cannot be justly numbered by the Pole. There
is more Earth for the Potter, then for the Goldsmiths. It Is no safe argument to
follow the multitude. Every one that draws hopes for a prize. but he that
hopes to be a Winner in this world, shall be a Looser.

The folly of the worldly ^ans wisdom is here easily ^ene. Here he will
willingly ^^st away Pounds upon un^^rtaine hopes: but in Gods ^ottery the
Church, he will judge his farthings, nay his ^esence: Yet here he gains ^me,
and saves his estate, ^ere he looses both. (Oh lord) I beseech thee to give
(...) grace to come to thy ^tore-house, where I may fur^ish my self with rich
com^odities at a low rate. I ^eed not fear to adventure, ^or all that comes
from thee (...) advantageous.

MEDITATION. 27.
Upon a great Candle in a fai^ Candle-sticke.
HOw comfortable, ho^ comely is this? an^ how wisely is it pla^ced. It Is pity
but such (...) Candle should have such (...) seat, and such a Candle-stick^
deserves such a Light. Ther^ is not any but affects it, if h^ well disposed.

How easily do I in thi^ see a good, and painful Preacher, well, and wisely
placed i^ a good Pulpit. His Doctri^ is no less comfortable, the^ convincing.
My Prayer shall (...) that every such light may ^ave such an Eminent
Prefer^ent. Those whose lives, and Doctrine are both holy, and ^anctifiedare
indeed burning, and shining Lamps, and do ^race the Temple, and Gospel ^f
Christ. Let me (Oh Lord) ^e but even a little Candle ^n thy Temple thus
qualified, and I cannot dislike my ^lace, nor doubt of Accep^ance, and
Approbation with ^hy Saints.

Upon a dead Coal.
Why this sooner extinguishd then another? or why at all? (...) that heat, so
suddenly, an^ totally vanish from the su^^iect? or being dead is it not (...)

It Is no otherwise with the Elect Children, want of go^^ exercises, and Company

extinguishe^ Satan by policy may cau^ some remissenes, but he sha^ not procure
absolute dead^nes. Graces in the Act are no^ always so sensibly operativ^ yet
the habit may remain firm. The Sun may be ^hid with clouds, but we know It
does then move in his Orb. It Is not a mean blessing to enjoy the company of
Gods Saints, who are not only warm in Grace themselves, but also make others
so to be.

MEDITATION: 29.
Upon seeing the Sun setting.
HOw glorious, comfortable, and pleasant was his light, this last hour? now
how dark and disconsolate is the Heaven, and what a sable Mantle spreads over
our heads, and how are the Earthly Inhabitants Canopied in Darkness.

How does it shadow out, the uncertain condition, and frail estate of the
greatest Monarchs, and the mutability of all worldly luster. Scepters have
their periods, and the greatest honors, and preferments their appointed dates.
Nothing under the Sun but is subject to setting.

Just such is the case of the body without the soul, and such is the state of
the soul, without Christ, miserable, uncomfortable. I entreat thee (Oh
Savior) never to deprive my soul of thy presence, but let me always be
comforted with the light of thy countenance, so I need not fear the darkness
of the Grave, nor that of Hell, being always in thy presence, who art that
Light, and that Sun which never sets, or changes.

MEDITATION. 30.
Upon a Stone in a River.
HOw unmovable, obdurate is this, though the waters are about it, above it
continually. It changes not the form, seldom the place, and is absolutely
unfit for any building, or necessary Employment, when as others that are
heavier, and greater then it, with a few drop^ of Rain only, are mollisied,
receive impression; are squared, and fitted for many excellent employments.

I cannot but behold (Oh God) the several conditions of sinful men, some are
so desperate, and accustomed in wickedness, that neither the often showring
down of mercy, nor judgment will work any thing upon them, such Pha^aohs are
they in self-will, perverseness, custom These are settled upon their Lees.

Others though heavier, and more laden in sin, yet with one drop of mercy,
or at the first shower of punishment, relent, mollify, and so, are sensible of
their miserable condition, and are often fitted by the Goodness of God, and the
Ministry of a diligent Preacher, for excellent uses in his Church. Keep me
(Lord) from hardness of heart, and insensiblenes in sin, let my soul be
mollified by thy mercy, and terrified by thy judgments, that thou may employ
it in some service for the glory of thy Name, the example of others, and the
comfort of it, at that great day of Reckonings.

MEDITATION. 31.
Upon the ill, and negligent Servant, Mat. 2^. 27.
HE ought to have put his Masters money to the Exchangers, but (...) Why not he
laboring as well as his two other fellow servants? Where was he privileged to
be idle, while the others were working? why not he performing his duty though
others were careless? he shall answer for himself. It Is dangerous sinning by
example, or pattern of others, but this man sinned against precept, and
without pattern: and I fear has ^olly made himself a Pat^erne, and Example
to others ^o sin by. It is bad to follow^ ^ickednes, but it is damna^le
Impiety to lead others. That seems to be one aggra^ation of Ieroboams
wicked^es, That he made Israel sin, that excuse can this idle ^oule make? will
he plead ^^norance? or impotency? not (...): His conscience galls him ^ere,
what then? was it a ^spitious fear of loosing? he ^ew this way of managing
(...) was the only warrantable, (...) advantageous course, this as one
principal end why (...) had it bestowed on him, (...) see how impudent he is
in a lie to his masters face, I knew thou wast an hard man, etc. While he is
ashamed to father his (...) himself, he villanously seeks to disgrace his
Lord.

I see thus much that many a wicked and ungodly wretch may be under a good
master.

VVithall that many (...) wicked man has had fair^ means of salvation lent

the enioyin^ of the means, but the righ^ employing them that giv^^ Happiness. I
may read o^ Lecture to my self, and (...) other Ministers, and One (...) Gods
people. That the rig^^ and constant excercising my ^alling is best in the
Royal Exchange, The Church. That those which are Gods ^actors for souls must
employ ^hemselues in this place. And for the people, that ^he only thing that
will give ^ontent to their conscience, and that will be approved ^f GOD, is to
turn there Talent of Hearing into ^oing.

a clear case for the Conscience, that Rewards are not to be taken ^hen, when
Gods glory, and truth must be declared.

Yet seldom has it been known that wicked men have wanted Assistants for
^here worst intentions. Liars ^re well furnished for the ^ost part with
Excuses. Sup^lanters of truth as they are ^olyticians, so they are well ^tored
with Instruments. Re^ellion seldom marches without Accomplices. The Execra^lest
murders as they have had their Plotters, so they have found Undertakers for
the Execution.

Lord I beseech the^^ keep me from withhol^ding the truth in a lye^ Let not

MEDITATION. 33.
^^on the Ethiopian Eunuch converted by Philip.
THis noble Courtier took good pains to take so ^ng a journey to go to
church, and it did please God to reward him well go^ng Homewards. The Church
^s the most likely place to be ^lessed in. He made the rea^ing of the
Scriptures as a ^leasant History, though ^he virtue, and the mystical meaning
was as yet hid from him. He was neither idle, ^or ill-imployed in his
Iour^ney. Reading is commendable, especialy of such things as may make for the
bett^^ring of us. Upon this (...) how God salutes Him wit^ an Occasional
winged pre^^cher.

God knows the Opportu^^nities to work upon us. Philip must join to him,
tha^ he may be joined to God.

I read not that this Great Lord Treasurer in his Coac^ disliked this Preachers
coming, nor yet the seeming bold question that he propounded.

I see in this Religiously affected Nobleman good Desires and good Motions to
know, and also God seconding his pious Endeavors and ^orkes his happy
conversi^n. It Is no small blessing to ^^joy the company of a faith^^ll
Preacher. We cannot ^^ppose what great Things God may bring to pass by ^hese
too much despised Em^assadors.

It Is not every one that can ^xpound Scripture aright. But ^^ere was one that
rightly di^ided and applied the word of Truth, and see the ope^ation of one
Sermon preached ^ffectually.

God send every true Be^eiver such a man to meet him, and bid him deliver his
Heart to God: these two met well, and parted better. Their salutation ended in
salvation. Let me upon (...) doubts light upon such (...) Expositor, and be
store^ with such a Commentary.

Upon seeing a Bird caught i^ a Snare.
HOw Agile, sweetl^ framd, beautiful, an^ Pleasant, was thi^ pretty Quirrister,
before (...) was thus captived; now, ho^ heavy, mourning, and discon^late is
it: having not onel^ lost her freedom, but e^^pos'd her self to open
^^struction.

The use of liberty without wantones is a pleasant blessing: but aiming at some
unlawful pleasure, or profit, proves dangerous to the Enioyer. (O Lord) it was
the soul of Man that was thus beautiful, pleasant, pure, and active in the
state of Innocence. What a spacious ^iberty had it either for Exercise, or
Recreation? but ^eing enthrald by that too ^oo cunning Fowler, by ^he snares,
and traps of sin^ull pleasure; How heavy, ^ow irksome, and how ^oathsome is
it, even to it self?

Sin makes us loose all ^ur spiritual mirth, and liberty, and exposes us to
manifest perdition. (Oh God) since there are so many snares, and politic
fowlers. Let my Soul, keep Above, and not settle here Below, so I shall
escape their devises, and preserve my own liberty.

Columbaest Anima, Aucepse^ Diabolus. MEDITATION. 35.
(...) the sight of a Thorn Tree, full of Blossoms.
What makes (...) growing, and flouri^shing in so good a piece of Ground? It
does deserve a ^ire rather, then such an happy Situation being naught in it
self, and choking the good Seed. It Is well when wickedness is barren, better
when it is quite rooted up, (may some say.)

But I admire thy patience, and thy wisdom, (Oh God) even toward these
vessels of wrath. It Is thy will, and wisdom to place them here. Who dare then
question thy Action for unjust? it stands here either for an open conversion,
conviction, or confusion.

We must not be our own sharers in our Petitions. All is not best that seems
so in our desires. We should revenge either too hastily, o^ two deeply in our
own, or our friends wrongs. Thy Lilly was troubled, and thy own Israel was
molested by these, yet both by thy Permission. (I believe they shall have a hot
day of it when it comes.

I envy not the felicity of the wicked, but patiently wait to see thy wisdom
manifested. We are but foolish Logicians, if we conclude hapines from
temporal blessings, the wicked may surfeit with them, and thy Elect want them.
Let them grow where, and how long thou please, I believe ^hy words, That the
wicked shall be rooted out at the last.

MEDITATION. 36.
Upon visiting a Rich man, in time of his sickness.
What resorting to His house, by kin^red, friends, and Neighbors? He wants
not their compa^y, Council, or help: when ^s an honest poor man may lie long
enough under (...) tedious sickness, and have ^o such Visitants. They ^ome for
his Goods, rather ^hen to do him any good. much like greedy Gleaner^ when the
Corn is cutting down. He makes his wi^^ against his will, settles his state,
assures all for the World At last sends for a Preacher who finds him unfitting
for God, or the World.

Sickness, and death (I see^^ are bold and impartial Ser^^nts. The World, and
weal^^ are but poor Bail upon deaths Arrests. All mean^ are nothing when God
stri^^ us. The wisdom of the wo^^ is but an (...) for He^ven.

The Rich are unwilling^^ dye because they know n^ a better life, and want
(...) to believe it.

Wealth, and riches often ^re but Percullisses let down ^o stop the passage
through ^he Gate to salvation. Rich ^orldlings have Gods Word ^n least, and
last consideration.

So let God order me, that in all estates I may be ^eady to part with All to
^nioy Him. But it is truly ^poaken, Oh! How bitter ^s the Remembrance of death
^o a man in his full possessions.

^n the sight of an Infant fed with Milk.
it were not for this ^inde of food the poor ^ant might starve. See how (...)
proportions to all Nou^^^^ment sitting there Age. (...) quietly you may see

How does (Oh God) (...) Heavenly Wisdom ^peare, in giving us sincere ^^ilke

that I may grow from strength, to strength, and from virtue, to vir^ue.

They are unnatural, and ^^nfiting Nurses, who either do not give Children
Milk at all, or else adulterated, and sophisticated with many dangerous
Ingredients to hinder their growth.

The first are careless, and unlearned Ministers: the second are superstitious,
and ^dolatrous false Teachers, who presumptuously mix^^ their human
Traditions t^ Gods Word, hindering the growth and increase (...) Gods Church.

Gods Word admits (...) mixture; it is desperate bold^nes either to withhold it,
(...) to add to it, being first, (...) necessary: secondly, so perfect in its
nature: Both will undergo that heavy curse of God, the one for Substraction,
the other for Addition.

MEDITATION. 39.
Upon the sight of the Moon.
THis Creature is now in the full luster, in the re^olution of a few days, how
is the beautiful light of ^t diminished, because it is not of, or from it
self, but borrowed from the Sun.

That is absolutely perfect whose subsistence is in it self. That body is but
imperfect whose Fundamentals are External dependances. Those Princes are
counted weak, whose Forces are borrowed from their Neighbors. Miserable is
that man who in^ His necessary employments must have a Leg from one, a Hand
from another, and an Eye from a third* That party dares not disobey him, by
whose power his Head stands on his Shoulders.

Seldom do they accomplish any great Actions, whose Materials are other men's
Beneplacits: To borrow another man's faith to go to Heaven, would seem but the
Errand of a beggarly Christian.

The body of the Moon Increases, and Decreases, to our sense, it is as subject
to change, as it is to mo^motion, If Philosophy will serve for an Argument.
Man's ^mutable state of his body sympathizes, or else is caused from it.

But howsoever it is no such mervaile if men be unconstant, faulty, and
fa^ding, since those more Caelestiall, and Superior creatures stood not all
steadfast, The Angels kept not their first Integrity. Worthy Calvin has it, Si
peccare norunt Parents in paradiso, quid mirum si Nos in sterquilinio?

It is (Oh Savior) with our souls, as with the Moon, she has light only
from the Sun. The light, and luster we have in our souls is thy comeliness
and beauty. We are darkness* but thou have made us light in the lord. Let me (O
Lord) cast away now the works of darkness, and put upon my soul the Armor of
of Light.

Upon the falling of Leaves in Autumn.
What a strange alteration is here in this Tree? The last quarter how
flourishing? how replenished? and decked with thousands of Attendants in
green, ^romising much to the sa^isfying of the beholders, but ^his was in
Summer.

How many such seeming Parasites are there, which will spread Sail with us in
(...) fair gale of Wind, or in a prosperous term, promising ^idelity, but in
the tempests, and violent storms of adversity, or affliction are suddenly
gone with a Non Novimus. Few men make haste to that Market where there is
nothing to be bought but blows.

It shows also to us the frail condition of the body, and worldly
preferments, how beautiful, and comely has this man been, and how honorable
this day, when suddenly but one ^it of a fever, or one frown of a Prince
has ^opt both in a moment. Suddenly have such Meteors, and Comets been
extinguished. God make me so resolute in perseverance, that I may hold my
first love. So neither the heat in Summer shall make me too proud, nor the
frosts in Winter affright, or displace me.

MEDITATION. 41.
Upon Reubens divisions. Judge. 5. 15. 16.
I wonder much, and grieve more at this unmatchable separation. Can those
hearts which should always be united, in so small a distance be divided? was
it any discontent that this Tribe harbored because it lost the privilege of
the first borne? Indeed lawful Heirs seldom part with their Prerogatives,
but threaten revenge, or intend it to the present possessors with Esa^, could
not the Equal Testament of a father so inspired be admitted for just, in so
many Generations, Without malice, or revenge.

This had been a fair opportunity for Reuben to have gaind that honor in the
field which he lost in an unlawful Bed. Was it because Deborah a Woman was
then the General in the Field? And so Reubens Regiment scorned to be led up in
Arms by ^o weak an instrument? but certainly he was then the more culpable,
being so potent a Tribe, and absent. Will he put the fault in Jordan because
he could not Pass over his high sweld Waves? Oh no! A willing mind slights
such poor excuses, and will affront the ^reatest perils.

Was it the force of the Enemies Army that affrigh^ed him, or did he think he
should come too late? For ^he first, he could not have ^azarded his life in a
fairer quarrel, nor amongst nearer friends, and if he had come, though after
the Battle, no question but Deborah, and all the Lords would have been glad
to have ^eene his Colors in the Field to triumph, though not to Fight. It
would have showed a readiness, and propensity of mind, and would have made an
Apology for his whole Tribe.

Howsoever he should have renewed his old familiarity with his brethren and
more then that, I^ would have caused a great fear in the Army of the
Adversaries, to have heard his Drums ^eating to succou^ his Brethren: The
union of Brethren is terrible, but their divisions are always spurs to their
Adversaries, and great advantages.

But briefly to lay him forth, he was busy about his private Commodities, his
Flocks, and his Herds, workt more with him, then Gods cause. It is a great
fault to slip opportunites in doing good, especially to our selves, and
brethren, how ^ong could he think to have ^njoyd his flocks at home, ^f his
Enemies had got the ^eild from his Brethren. Our ^rivate gains must not be
^referd before our Countries.

And such, and no other are worldly men, when I am assaulted by the power of
Satan, or tentations. What comfort will these afford my soul? Noe: they will
neither lend me Comfort, Council, or Prayer. So his fault was in respect of
the Cause, the Time, his Person, his Friends, Adversaries, and Example.

MEDITATION. 42.
Upon Sleep.
THe natural sleep is (...) cessation of all labor, mo^tion, action. With
excess i^ brings poverty, shame, dis^grace, sicknesses, diseases ^ He that is
given to sleep^ shall not be rich. It stupe^fies, besots the best sences^ and
faculties of the sou^^ and makes them unfit so any good employment, o^ virtuous
action. It is the Rust of the whole man.

Nature cannot move t^ Grace in its own condition The spiritual sluggard i^
^he only poor man. He ^^at lies down in the sleep ^f sin, shall rise in
shame.

No such diseased person ^s the spiritual sluggard. ^is poverty, and shame may
^ome slowly, but violently as ^n Armed man.

I beseech thee (O Lord) ^o waken me from slum^ring, or sleeping in sin. So
may work powerfully, and ^h^erefully while the time, and day of grace does
shine: ^he night of death will come, ^hen no man can work. I ^ould wish that
all would ^ake St. Paul's counsel, Awake thou that sleep, arise, ^ud stand
up, and Christ shall ^ive thee light.

Somnus animae periculosus. MEDITATION. 43.
Upon the sight of a fair Garden.
I Question not the Gard^ners skill, nor his diligenc^ neither doubt I the
goodne^^ either of the Ground, (...) of the Seed sown in i^ Yet I see more
Weeds, the^ Herbs, or Roots, wha^ base usurping, intruding Hinderers are
these of be^^ter things. Pull them up what make they growing (...) so choice a
Piece, to the disturbance of those whole some, and medicinabl^ Herbs and
Flowers, se^ the patient Wisdom of the Master. They must grow, for that place
is not privileged here. This Mixture is tolerable as long as the Master
permits it. The best Wheat may be fanned, but yet there will some Chafe be
amongst it.

(O Lord) thy skill, and diligence, is admirable in the Managing of that of
spiritual Garden the Church. Thy Word which is the seed is good, and pure, thy
Ministers, which are the true Laborers, are watchful, and careful over it,
Yet the purest Congregation is enterlac't, and mixed with Hypocrites. It was not
that Heavenly Jury of Apostles that was free from a Judas.

I pray God, I may truly, and faithfully discharge my duty. And leave the
success, and end to the wise will of my Lord, and Master.

Gods Congregation is no more to be forsaken for Hypocrites being in it, then
a wedge of fine Gold is, for having two, or three grains of dross in it.

MEDITATION. 44.
Upon Fire.
THere are five special gifts that make this Instrument admirable. Heat,
Light, Purity, his nature of Ascending, and Consuming. If we come too near
it, it will prejudice us, if we stand too far from it, it will not benefit
us. A wise Mediocrity is the profitablest station.

I do lively (Oh God) in this see, and acknowledge thy heavenly spirit of
truth, it is that good Spirit that enlightens our understandings, that by his
power, and Energy ^eats our Affections, who by his only Purity, and Sanctity
cleanses our Souls, and Bodies, making them fit Temples for Himself, and
Peculiar Vessels for his own use, who by his worth teaches us to set our
Affections, and Souls not on Things below, Temporary, Worldly, and such as are
subject to sense, and corruption, but to mount Higher, and to seek those
Things which are Above, who does expel, and drive out of our Souls all
^infull lusts, and rebellious corruptions.

Learn me (O God) Humility, not with too too bold a Presumption to pry into
thy Closet of Divine, and reserved Secrets, and withal, give me that care,
and wisdom to frequent those spiritual exercises, for as the first is
forbidden rashness, so the other is forbidden sloth, and negligence.

Lord let me always have a Coal of this Fire, in the House of my soul, to
warm me by, in the coldest day of Affliction, and let me ever have a vigilant
care that I suffer it not to be quenched, or extinguished.

Ignis hic Fovendus. MEDITATION. 45.
Upon the sight of a poor man Begging.
He makes the High way the place of his gains, his Rags and Soars, the
Orators of his necessity, and the induction for men's charity. Oftentimes
Petitionates some Nobleman, by relation of his long suites in Law, or of his
losses by the casualty of Fire, or Water, or that he is destitute of Friends,
and Means, and so finds Relief, Compassion, Clothing. What a good Policy is
this for our poor, and miserable souls, Jesus Christ in his Word, in his
Sacraments, and Church, is the road way of our gains. Our sick, and
distressed Souls, and Consciences, ou^ wounded and broken Spirits are the
Sores and ulcers, which move us to beg, and cry out for mercy: which also are
the only and best means to get thy Pity, favor, compassion. Prayers are our
Petitions to turn away the Rigor of thy Law, and the Fire of thy Justice.

Show thy mercy (Oh Lord and Savior) or we are wretched. No Friends, or
means but thy Self, Merits, Pardons, Indulgences, Pu^gatory, Pilgrimage,
Supererrogations have no force, or virtue. Lend us thy Roabes of Righteousness
to adorn us, Thy self to cherish us, so our Persons, and Prayers shall be
accepted, otherwise thou may go by us, and we never the better.

Lord, make us common, and ^arnest Beggars at thy Door of Mercy, so we need
not be ashamed of thy Gifts, nor of this Profession.

MEDITATION. 46.
upon the sight of a Frontiere Garrison.
What care, provision, policy, and guar^ing is in this place. What ^alles,
Moates, Halfe^oons, Horn works, Draw^idges, Ramparts, and Palli^does do I
behold, to secure ^emselues within, from the ^olence of a threatening foe ^thout.

How fitly does this object ^arne me to Barricadoe my ^ule from all the
entrances, ^^d approaches of my bloody, ^^d spiritual Adversaries, those
Out-guards, and for^ lorne Sconces of my Eye^ Ears, Words, and Actio^ are to
be well looked too and that privy passage of m^ thoughts must be warily kep^

upon a King, and Traitors.
^He Law apprehends, Arraignes, Conuicts, and ^ondemnes these Malefac^rs, They
not only loose ^eir own lives, and honors, ^t disgrace and overthrow ^eir
Children, the King may of mercy, power, free lo^ and his princely Prerogat^

It Is just the case of (...) by Nature, God by his La^ Justice, Severity may;

therefore (O^ Heavenly Father) thy merc^ and free lov^ to save Any o^ All, when
as thou Ius^ might have destroyed (...) (good God) grant me Pardon royal
for all my Re^bellions, and seal it I b^^seech The with the Blood (...) Jesus

MEDITATION. 48.
Upon the Angels.
^Hese Creatures are agile, Powerful, All perfect, ^d good by Creation,
dif^ent by sin. Their Nature, ^umber, Employment, show ^e Mercy, Justice,
Power, ^^d Wisdom of their ^reator. Their employment ^owes the Just wages of
O^dience, and Pride, their num^r, what a Large, and Royal ^ourt Heaven is, and
what a ^st prison Hell is. Their Of^e proves that the Righteous ^e always well
guarded with ^eruants, and Defenders: and ^at the wicked are always vexed with
tormenting Exe^^tioners.

Let me (Oh God) ^^ware of sin, which man Angels, Devils. Thou di^dest punish
it in these ^^verely, wilt not Allow it any. My Calling gives (...) the same
Name, let me (...) found faithful in it, lest loose Honor, and life. (...) and
Men are the chief (...) thy works for Mercy, (...) Justice. They both are the
(...) and the worst of all thy Cr^^tures. I may learn (...) these, what I had
been, (...) I must not be, and what shall be.

Corruption Optimi p^ssima. MEDITATION. 49.
Of a Physician.
GOD has made him a fit Instrument for Health. ^^perience, Knowledge, and
^^thfulnes warrant, and ^ommend him. The dis^ed must receive his Pre^iptions
with Preparation, Approbation, Thanksgiving: here is little hope of any (...)
without him. These (...) add Efficacy to his Medicines. Some neglect the
(...), others the second, some All. So they justly groan, and greive under a
continu^^ sickness.

It Is no otherwise with (...) and our Souls. He (...) sent Jesus Christ the
Auth^^ of our Spiritual Healt^ his Knowledge, Experience, (...) faithfulness

MEDITATION. 50.
Upon a Soldier.
See in these Professors a dangerous Mixture, some (...) march in the same Army
whose Hearts are with their ^rethrens Enemies, And as Opportunity serves, Run
^^way, mutineere, or (...) absolute Cowards upon (...) of Pike, or any great
service Yet some there are, (...) deserve Commendations (...) their
qualification of Ob^^dience, Courage, Patience, wat^^fulnes, and Constancy.

It has been always (...) (Oh Lord) in the Spirit^^all Army, some Israeli^^
have their Hearts with (...) Lords of the Philistines, (...) ^ayly Run away
from Gods Garrison, the Church They go out from us, b^^cause they were not of
us. O^thers turn Rebels to Ies^^ Christ his Kingdom, with Nolumus Hunc
Regnare, an^ ^housands are faint-harted, and white liverd, though the ^ause be
good, and God has promised to defend it.

They are thy Faithful, and Elect (O God) that undergo the Heat of the day. I
beseech Thee qualify me with parts Requisite, and then I fear not the faces,
nor forces of those Goliah^like, Enemies. I am sure I shall have some true
Comrades to go with me, and some to follow me. The Lord General is marched
before with a strong Regiment, He has, and will for ever Triumph. I doubt not
to have a share of Comfort with him, as well as of B^owes for him.

MEDITATION. 40.
Upon seeing a Man looking upon the Sun with his Eyes Immediately.
THis man's Judgment is Erroneous, because his Perspectiue deceives him, he
Concludes the Sun to be noe greater then it does Appear to his Eye. He may
as well conclude that it does not move, because he perceives It not. The Height
of it from the Earth, the weakness of his Sense, and the Greatness of It Is Light
makes this confusion in his Judgment.

It Is no otherwi^e in the spiritual Vision, the Natural Man perceives not the
Greatness, and Glory of that Sun of Righteousness, The state of Glory is not to
be seen with the Eye of Sense, or Reason. Spiritual Objects must be
Spiritually discerned.

He that will Rightly, and Effectually behold Thee (Oh Savior) must have the
Prospective of Faith. The Mystery of thy Conception, Incarnation, Resurrection,
and Ascension are so high above Nature, That Flesh, and Blood cannot attain
unto them. Such Knowledge is too deep for the mere Naturalist, In beholding
these deep Points, Let me put out the Eye of Reason, and open the Eye of
faith. Oh Lord give me such an Instrument, so I shall neither fail in my
Expectation, nor be falsified about the Object. For Faith draws firm
Conclusions.

MEDITATION. 52.
Upon seeing a Tent Pitched up, and suddenly Removed.
HOw fit this Instrument is for motion, when as great Howses are Burthenous,
and are of that nature they they cannot be our Companions in any sudden
extremities. This I see is of that ease, and yet convenient enough for a
Covering, That a man may carry it all day at his back, like a Snayle.

In cases of sudden necessity the Tent is the better house. I had rather have
a Tent, and escape the danger of a Pursuing Enemy, then a fair great House,
and my life taken away in it.

(Believe it) Riches, and this worldly Pomp have the greater Inconveniences.
He that has least of this worldly Goods, has the fewer fears. Feriunt Summos
fulmina Montes, Give me a poor Life with safety, rather then Riches with such
hazards. Let me never look for a long stay of certainty here, but always so
live, as expecting every moment a removeall from hence. Militia est vita
hominis super terram.

MEDITATION. 53.
Upon the covetous Rich M^n, Luke 12. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
HOw full of care was this Earth-worme? yet how secure? how foolish?

What a base sin is that which makes men so greedy, and so restles in getting
wealth, and being gotten, debars the Master of the Right, or of any good Use of
it: while he will not part with his (...), he must part with his (...). And
when he thinks to gain the World, he must (...) it. While he is making ^his
Resolutions, he is forced to his Dissolution: before he can Build, or Enlarge
his Barnes, he must pass to his Grave.

He basely seeks to hoard ^p that, which he should have distributed, what
fair Opportunities does a rich Covetous man loose.

Many may, and shall smart for having so (...) lent to them, and they no^
lending any, to any.

The possession gives not the master happiness, so much as the distribution.

The one^y way to gain Eternal^, is to pass away Tem^^^ls.

The certainty of death, and the uncertainty of the time, is, and ought to be
a great Motive to weane us all from covetousness.

MEDITATION. 54.
Upon the sight of a Pismire.
I See greater Creatures that may learn of this, to get their own living,
some reasonable Ones scarce get it so diligently, and honestly, as this
contemptible Worm. It labors while a fair opportunity is offered, Her work
is not to prejudice others by Oppression, or Extortion, merely for
sustentation against harder times, and for the well being of her self, and her
necessary Family.

A necessary direction for all Sluggards, and Spend thrifts, who may go to
her, and hear Lectures of Diligence, and Providence wisely discoursd of. The
first, she teaches to get his own Bread, and not to live by unlawful means.
The second, she tutors to provide for his Wife, and Children, and to have
something reserved for a rainy Day of Sickness, of Adversity, or both.

As I see providence in this Creature, so I observe a society with Order. There
are no Private or Domestique quarrels practiced amongst them. Nature has
settled peace, and concord in their Co^fines. Private Contentions are a
continual dropping to a Family, which may prove an unhappy overflowing tempest
to the Republique. Abraham's advice is worth Imitation. Let there be no
contention between thee, and me, or thy Shepherds, and mine, For we are
Brethren: Unity crowns Fraternity. Divisions are the bane of the strongest
Societies: civil wars made potent Rome a Cripple, an house divided against it
self is, as when the Head wounds the Heart, or the Hand, both. It was
deplored, when Ephraim was against Manasseh, and Manasseh against him, yet both
against Judah. Peace not only makes a State flourish, but also establishes,
and con^firmes it.

The goodness of the Creature lies not in the greatness. Wisdom goes not
always by strength. Many other Creatures read Morality to man, this little
great Student reads Morality, and Divinity. I would be loath this little
Harvest-man should condemn me. Let me gather food for my soul while I have
the Sun of the Gospel. So in the days of scarcenes, I shall have enough.

MEDITATION. 55.
Of HEAVEN.
It Is Beautiful, Large, High, and Firm, God made it a Court for Himself,
Angels, and good men. There have been many in it, who shall never come into it
again. They cast out themselves Eiectione firma, It is full of beauty,
Majesty, yet the poorest Peasant may be a privileged Courtier.

It Is large, to give spacious liberty to the Inhabitants. It Is High, yet made
for the Lowly, and Humble, firm to consummate the bliss of the godly.

The beauty of thy Cou^^ makes^mee think what an infinite Majesty the Maker of
it is of. Secondly, it puts me in mind of the necessity of my sanctification,
for no unclean thing shall come in there. Thirdly, the glorious happiness of
thy Elect vessels, that shall dwell in it for ever.

The largnes of it shows that this Earth, and my Body, are the Prisons of my
soul, so that I desire to enjoy that spacious liberty.

The Height, and distance of it from the Earth, warnes me to begin my journey
^^ither betimes. The firmnes (...) it keeps me from des^ire. I may the surer
find (...) because the Court never (...) moves. Thy Court (O God) (...) full
of Favorites. Let me, ^entreat thee be enrolled a^ong the rest, for One. The
^ay is narrow, yet to be (...). If I seek it, as I may, (...) I ought, or as
thousands (...) done before me. (Oh lord) whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and
who do (...) desire on Earth, in compa^^son of Thee?

Glorious things are spoken (...) Thee, thou City of God.

MEDITATION. 56.
Upon the Fish in the Sea.
HOw long have these crea^tures spaciated them^selves in this watery World yet
come forth not infecte^ with the saltnes of the plac^ their Bodies are capab^^
of it, they lodge, and (...) in it, feed in it, and (...) in it.

Behold an Admirab^^ Pattern for us from the Seafaring Inhabitants. (...)
godly man will keep his I^^tegrity at all times, and (...) all places. Though
it be great Blessing to have our Lotte, and Habitation in Zion, yet if it be
in Sodom, goodness is not there to be left.

I shall never approve of his Actions, who changes his mind with the places
he passes through: to be for the Coule in Rome, and Rhemes, in Geneva a
Praecisian, A Lutheran in Dantzick, A Protestant in London, and an Heathen in
Barbary.

He is not a good man who follows this Mutability, These Creatures shall
Condemn those then that will Conform themselves to all sins, of all places.
Drunkenness with the Dutch, Lust with French, Infidelity wit^ the Italian,
Ambition, an^ cruelty with the Spaniard Treachery with the Moore Witchcraft
with the Lap^lander, Covetousnes with the Jew, Malice with the Turk and
Hypocrisy at home.

A Wise Man keeps himself free from the sinne^ of the Times, persons, and
places. It is not the plac^ that makes Good, or Bad. A Man may be Good in the
Camp, and bad in the Church. I beseich thee (Oh Lord) to give me
Circumspection over my Ways, so in all places I may retain goodness, and keep
Piety.

MEDITATION. 57.
Upon Saul sparing Agag, and the rich, and best of the Booty 1 Samuel 15.
HEaven would punish Amaleck with the sword, But Earth will pity him with
Covetousnes: God intends Justice, Saul aims at Profit. He looks not so much
upon his Commission to obey it, as he seeks Euasions to transgress it.

The greatest Princes may fail in their designs, when such Generals are put
upon the Execution.

Actions of the greatest Consequence laid upon the performance of unjust
stewards come short of the first ^ntendments.

Covetousness is as Bad a fault in a Commander as Cowardice. The one dare not
fulfill his Iniunction, the other will not.

That Pity is Execrable that hinders Heavens Justice. The Sword is sometimes to
be used rather then the Scepter. There may be time when the General in the
Field must be as a Judge, not regarding the beauty, wealth, or quality of the
person, but must proceed with Justice. If God commands the Rule to be General,
^t's no safe practice to put in Exceptions. Gods Edicts need not humane helps
to perfect them. The fitest Gloss upon them is Obedience to them. This
conclusion is firm. Heaven commands this, or that, therefore it is good. being
good, It is to be performed.

Saul's proceeding in this kind is much like to a Partial Minister. God
Commands him to destroy all those spiritual Amalekites, sins. But he only
beats down the sins of poor Men, but spares, and connives at great Men's
faults, holding them Prisoners in his heart, not willing to Incur perhaps
their Disfavour.

And all those Men which only root out small Corruptions, and lesser sins
from Their souls, but let great Ones reign still, either for Profit, or
Pleasure, or both, do falsify with God, as Saul did here.

Lord I pray thee give me grace to perform what thou Command. For Obedience
is at all times, in all things pleasing to Thee.

Obedientia praestantior He^atombis. MEDITATION. 45.
Upon his own Thoughts by way of conclusion.
It Is harder I think than to be well Employed, not to be employed at all. It
is as Toylsome to be ill Occupied, as it is to be Idle. I cannot conceive that
such an Operative Organ as the soul can want work. It may as well be thought
to cease to Be, as not to be laboring. She is mistress in such a foul
House, she had need always be cleansing, she lodges so many guests, that it
is a continual work to place all in Convenient Rooms. Many Thoughts are such
Quick Guests they will be gone, and steal away some good from her, unles
she be wary.

They are all like Curreirs carrying out, and bringing in news from her, to
the World, and from the World, to her.

They are always in Travail, the soul abounds with them, as the Sun with
Moates. We are borne to Labor, and we must perform our Task. As the
Thoughts of Man are Many, so they are different, All are not good, nor all bad.

There is not any thing is blessed with such a Library, as the soul of Man is,
Every Object within, and without reads to her observations of Morality, and
Piety. She cannot complain for want of Variety, for the whole Universe is her
study.

Her thoughts are but her Servants, which she Entertaines, or discharges as
they please, or dislike her.

I could wish that my thoughts would be tied upon the Quatuor Novissima. So
they would never be ill Employed.

I pray thee (O God) to set a watch over all my thoughts, That they may be such
only as may Glorify Thee, Benefit my self, and Better others, and this is my
Thought.

Come Lord Jesus, come Quickly.

MEDITATION. 59.
Upon his reading the Occasional Meditations of the Reverend Doctor Hals
Composition.
It Is good to have a pattern, then it is a great blessing to stir up others
to good Endeavors. I must confess I had not labored but by His advice: his
Fire made my Coal burn. It is as necessary a way for a Christian, as I know
any, and as Beneficial, and pleasant to the soul.

It Is Lawful to Imitate any good Action in any One, we might else casheire
Examples, and only entertain Precepts, but that Magis ducimur Exemplis quam
Praeceptis, the virtues of our Predecessors had died before this time, had they
not been maintained by worthy Imitators. It is Blockish stupiditie then to be
senseles of embracing such offered benefits.

It is the easier for the soul to collect something out of every thing. We are
all beholding to the Pens that has writ before us. I cannot see how a wise
Christian, can let any thing pass him, without some benefit by it. For a good
Scholar in Christ's Church will reduce most things to Application.
