BY THE LORD DEPVTIE AND COUNCIL.
WHereas by an Act of Parliament made in the fifteenth year of the reign of
King Henry the seventh of famous memory, it was at the prayer of the Commons
ordained and established* That the said King and his Heirs should have,
perceive and levy of all and every xx. s. worth of all manner of Merchandise
and Wares brought into this land of Ireland, by any manner of person or
persons, to be sold within the same Land, twelve pence, and likewise should
have, levy and receive of every twenty shillings worth of all manner of
Merchandise and Wares after the price that they be bought within this Land, and
to be carried out of the same, to be sold by any manner of person or persons
beyond the Sea, twelve pence, as in the same Act among other things, more at
large is contained;

And forasmuch as hitherto the Wares and Marchandizes out of which the said
poundage or twelve pence of the pound is to be raised, have had not certain
values or Rates set upon them in this Kingdom, by reason whereof the said
Poundage or twelve pence of the pound has not been truly and fully answered
unto the Kings most excellent Majesty, and his Progenitors;

We have therefore caused all the goods and Marchandizes chargeable with the
said poundage either brought in, or transported out of this Kingdom, together
with the several kinds, qualities, numbers, weights, measures and contents of
the same, and the values, prices, and Rates thereof to be particularly entered
and expressed in this present Book, containing in leaves on both sides ^^to
the intent his Majesty may henceforth be justly answered of the said
poundage, according to the tenor of the said Act of Parliament;

Wherefore we do hereby declare and publish his Highness pleasure and comandment
to be, That all his Majesty's Customers or Collectors of Customs or Subsidies
within any Port, Haven or Creek of this his Highness Realm of Ireland, for the
time being shall from and immediately after notice given by these presents of his
Highness said pleasure, leauie and take up to his Majesty's use the said
poundage or twelve pence upon the pound, according to the prises, values, and
rates mentioned and expressed in this Book, and not otherwise, as they and
every of them will answer for the contrary, at their perils.

Willing further, and hereby commanding his Majesty's Thresurer and Barons of
the Eschecquer of this Realm, and the said Comptroullers and Surueyors for the
time being, within any Port, Haven, or Creek of this Realm of Ireland, and
every of them, to charge the said Collectors and Customers and every of them,
to see his Highness duly answered of the said poundage, according to the
values, prices, and Rates, mentioned in this Book, and none otherwise. Given
at his Majesty's Castle of Dublin the xxiij day of June. 1608.
