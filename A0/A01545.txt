TO THE JUDICIOUS and ingenuous Reader.
HOw backward I have ever heretofore bin (best knowing mine own weakness) to
publish ought by the Press, they best know, who having often pressed me
thereunto, have never hitherto therein prevailed. Now a twofold necessity is
imposed upon me of doing somewhat in this kind, partly by the importunity of
diverse Christian friends, religious and judicious, who having either heard,
being partakers of my public Ministry, or heard of by report of others, or
upon request seen some part of this weak work, have not ceased to solicit
the further publishing of it: As also partly, (and more specially) by the
iniquity of some others, who being of contrary judgment in some particulars
therein disputed, have bin more forward than was fit by unchristian slanders
and uncharitable censures to tax and traduce both me and it. From whose unjust
and undeserved aspersions no way seemed better and readier to clear either,
than by offering to open view of all, what I had before delivered in an obscure
auditorie (to speak of) among but a few. And this thou have here (good Reader)
for effect and substance the same that was then and there delivered, enlarged
only with such matter of History and Humanity as was not so fit to pester the
Pulpit or incomber that Auditorie withal. For the occasion of entering first
into this discourse, and motives of wading so far in it, I refer thee to Chap
9.. 10.
that part of it where I render an account thereof, unwilling to stay thee
longer, than needs must be, in the entry. If any shall surmise that writings in
this kind may occasion too much liberty, a thing that little needs in this
ouer-licentious age: I answer breifely; first that See Gerson in regul. m^r.
and Nider in consolat. timoraonscieuc. part. 3. c. 20. ad Cap. 9 10.
it is unequal that for the loosenes of some dissolute, the consciences of
those that be godly disposed should be entangled and ensnared: and secondly,
that whosoever shall take no more liberty than by me is here given, shall be
sure Read the whole 9, Chapter.
to keep within the bounds of Piety, of Sobriety, of Equity, and of Charity:
than which, I know not what can be more required. For no sinister end (I
protest before Gods face and in his fear) undertook I this task; neither
have I auerred or defended ought therein, but what I am verily persuaded to be
agreeable to Gods word. If any man can better inform me in ought, I shall be
right ready to hearken unto him: neither have I neglected any means in this
kind, (by writing and conference with others, besides mine own private labors)
that might further me therein. Defects in it (I know) there can not but be
many: what, or whose work is free from them? mine of many, much more: too many
my self see; and many more (I well wot) a curious eye may soon epsy. Let them
in friendly and loving manner be showed me by any; (as form have already bin by
by some; whom I rest beholden to for it) and I shall count it a special
kindness. Where defects shall appear, let it yet be considered, whether they be
vital and fundamental or no, such as touch the very heart and life of the
maine matter, or such as notwithstanding them the frame (or foundation at
least) may stand firm: And withal let it be remembered that I deal in an
Argument that has hitherto bin handled very confusedly by the most, and not
very soundly by the best; as to any indifferent eye upon due view of this
present discourse may very evidently appear. Of thee (whosoever thou art) I
desire but to find an impartial Reader, a judicious discusser, and a
charitable censurer; that Praeiudicium eni^ non est indiciu^, sed vitium. Aug.
ad fra^r. inerem.
what I hold be not condemned out of prejudice unheard; Ne mea dona tibi studio
dispost^a fideli, Int^ll^cta prius quae sint, contempta relinquas. Lucret. de
terum not. l 1.
what I prove be not rejected because it is not conceived; and (...) dictu^
Theodori Athei reference Piu arch^ lib. de Tra^quillis.
what I profer with the right hand be not taken with the leaft, but that
Charity may continue with diversity of judgment, if thou shall in ought
remain yet unsatisfied; a course too too much wanting in this uncharitable
age. And this favorable acceptance if these my sorry first fruits shall find,
it may encourage a weak beginner to attempt somewhat further hereafter, that
may be of better use. Them and thee I commend both to him, who is the Author of
all Truth, the clearing whereof has bin in this work my maine aim: He
vouchsafe a blessing; and through his blessing the labor (I hope) shall prove
not unfruitful.

use of Lots and Lotery, as it is very ancient, so has bin in all ages no less
frequent among men of all sorts. And considering that those things that are
most in use, are by means of man's corruption most subject to abuse; Abusui
maxim^ sunt obnoxia, quae in vsu sunt frequentissimo. Meisner: sobr: Philos: p
1. praef.
it ought not to seem strange, if the like has among the rest befallen Lots;
if having been so much in use, they have not been free from much abuse; if
having been used by so many, they have bin abused by the most. For 1 Timothy 4.4.
cum. Tit. 1.15. Agg. 2.14, 15. Esai. 1.11.17.
what Creature of God, or what Ordinance, be it civil or sacred, though good
and holy in it self, is so happy, but that it receives, if not a deep
tincture, yet at least some slight fully, from the foul hands or defiled
fingers of the most that deal with it. That the lawful use therefore of this
Ordinance may be wisely discerned and warily severed from the abuse of it (
(...). Plutar: de ^dul^ and ^me^:
so that neither the use of it be wholly banished and abandoned in regard of the
abuse, as where Friend and Flatterer are both indiscreetly thrust out together
at one door; nor yet way be given to the abuse of it while the right use is
admitted, as where the door is vnheedily set open to Flattery while men hope to
entertain Friendship;) is the maine matter that in this whole Treatise is
aimed at. Which that it may be the better and the more orderly performed, it
will not be amiss that we endeavor to consider and conceive aright, in the
first place what the nature of a Lot is in general; and next to that, what the
several sorts thereof are; whereby the warrantable and unwarrantable use of
them may the more plainly appear.

2. A Lot therefore may be well thus either defined or described, that it is a
casualty or casual event purposely applied to the deciding of some doubt.

In which definition or description so conceived, (as in all other) are two
things principally to be considered, the genus, as they term it, that
contains the matter; and the form or specificall difference of the thing
defined.

The Genus, or the matter of a Lot is said to be a casualty, or some casual
event, because that how soever in some kind of Lot some guess may be given,
yet the event is mainly casual, and it is the casualty of it, that is
principally respected and necessarily required in it unto the constitution of a
Lot. Those therefore reach a little too far that define a Sorts proprie
dicuntur, cum aliquid fit, vt eius euent^ confiderato occultu^ ^liquid
innetescat. Thom: sum: per 2^.2z. q. 95. a. 8. cum facimus aliquid, vt occultu^
aliquid nobis manifestetor. Ibid: art: 3. Nihil aliud est sortiri qua^ aliquid
agere, ex enius euentu re^ incognitam possimus deprehendere. Martyr. in 1 Samuel:
c. 10.
Lot to be the doing of any thing whatsoever by the event whereof some hidden
thing may be discovered. For many things are and may be done for the discovery
of hidden and unknown truths, which yet come not within the nature and
compass of a Lot. For example; A man suspecting his servant to be
light-fingred, lays money as a bait in his way to tempt him withal, and
thereby to try his honesty which he has in some jealousy, which yet is no
kind of Lot: to omit many other courses used ordinarily by those that are in
place of authority and judicature for the finding out of malefactors and the
discovery of crimes, in which yet there is no kind of Lotery, no more then of
casualty. Whereas the matter of a Lot is ever some event merely casual; as if
a man to try whether his servant be a thief or no, shall put a scroll with his
name in it, together with others rolled up severally into water, to see which
will unfold first, and thereby to determine and judge of the party suspected
whether he be guilty or guiltless of that crime. To which purpose tend those
sayings of good Authors, that Sortiri est casum and tem^ritate^ spectare, vbi
nec ratio nec consilium valeat. Cicer: dediuin: l. 2.
To use Loterie is to put a thing from skill and counsel to temeritie and
casualty. that (...) dixit Euripides. Plut. sympos. l. 2. c. 10. Quo loco male

A Lot is the child of chance. that Sortis euenius no^ est in nostra

The issue of Lots is not in man's power, but is such as casualty casts on us.

In Lotery there is no certainty. that S^rs inter homi^es casu, non indicio

casus, non ratio, nec consilium valcat. Cicidiuin: l. 2.
Lots are not carried by reason and judgment, nor by counsel and advice: but
(...). Isocr: Areopag.
Chance and casualtie strikes the chief stroke in them; if we respect
secondary causes.

It was no Lot therefore, but a mere mockery of a Lot, that Vise Cicer: in
Verr: 4.
Verres sometime used, when a Priest being to be chosen by Lot at Syracusa,
The^mnesti nomen omnibus inscribi eurauit.
he caused the tickets or tokens that were cast into the Lot-pot to be signed
all of them with one and the self same man's name: It was, I say, no Lotery,
because there could be no casualty or uncertainty in the drawing of the tickets
so signed. But of Chance or casualty we will speak more at large in the next
Chapter.

3. The form or specificall difference of a Lot is taken from the use and
intent or purpose of the vser, or that whereunto this casualtie or casual
event is applied; which is said to be the deciding or determining of some
doubt, whether it be the defining of some act to be done hanging yet in
suspense, or the discovery of some hidden and unknown truth in things done or
suspected to be done already. And this is that which distinguishes a Lot from
all other casual events and accidents, and that makes the casual event so
used to be a Lot so justly accounted and called. Every Lot therefore is
casual; and there can be no Lotery, where there is not casualty. But every
casual event is not consequently a Lot: For many things fall out casually, and
do befall men so continually in the whole course of their lives, which yet come
not the most of them within compass of a Lot: as, meeting of those by the way
that they never minded or once dreamed of; lighting on some one in the street
or at the market, whom they desired to speak with, while they are going about
other business; the finding of some one thing while they look after an other,
or while they look after nothing but go on in their way: These things and the
like are casual, but no lots; there is no lotery at all in them; because these
things may befall a man will he, nil he, and do many times whether he regard
them or no, whereas a Lot depends upon the will and purpose of the vser, who
by applying the thing zsed to such ends and purposes, makes a Lot of that
which otherwise in it own nature were none. But for a man to apply such a
casual thing or the casual occurrence of any such thing to the discovering,
defining, deciding, determining or directing of any truth unknown, event
uncertain, or course unresolved, is to use it as a Lot, and to make a Lot of
it; this being that that gives the very essence of a Lot to it. To this
agrees that definition of a Lot and Lotery given by some others, who define
Sorsest effectus fortuitus statuens de consilijs nostris. Aret. in problem:
clas. 1. loc. 67.
A Lot to be a casual event determining our purposes: (though that be somewhat
too scant, and comprehend but one kind;) and, Sortibus vti est ex vario euentu
seu dispositione alicuius rei sensibilis propesitae, dubium aliquod
determinare. Lyra in Number. cap. 34. and in Proverb. c. 16.
Lotery (whereof more anon) to be the determining of some doubt or uncertainty
by the variable event or disposition of some sensible thing that we propound to
our selves. Which latter definition, though it do not so exactly point out the
precise matter of a Lot, as we shall afterward show, yet does fully comprehend
the proper use of a Lot, and that which justly makes the casual event to be
so termed and esteemed.

4. Out of that therefore which has been said of the nature of a Lot may be
raised, as I take it, somewhat a better definition, or at least description of
Lotery, to wit, that it is the deciding or determining of a doubt by some
casual event. For that Lotery is not but where some question or controversy
is of some sort or other, a doubt of somewhat whither done or not done, or by
whom, or in what manner done, or some deliberation concerning somewhat to be
done or not done, or to be done either in this or that sort, which is by the
Lot to be decided and determined, is a matter out of question, not denied of
any, but agreed upon by all. Now whereas many and sundry, yea infinite in a
manner are the means whereby questions and controversies are determined, of all
these it is In a Lot there must be 2 things: 1 a casual act: and 2 the
applying of that act to the determination of some controversy. Perkins Cases

some casualtie or casual event only that is made choice of for the
determining of the doubt in that which we properly term Lotery. In regard
whereof as they wander far from the right path in this point, Serar. in Josh:

divination by men's names as foretelling their fortunes, and whether should
prevail either against other, and the like: the means in these cases whereby
the doubt or controversy is determined being not merely casual, and the
decision of the doubt thereby therefore improperly so termed.

5. Where let me add yet one thing further, that it is not only necessary in
the matter of Lotery, that the thing be casual that is applied to the deciding
of a doubt, but that it be thereto applied so far forth as it is casual, (I
speak in regard of the creature both using and used) not as it has either in
it own nature, or in the conceit or counsel of those that make such use of
it, any special relation otherwise to the business thereby to be decided. An
instance or two will help to clear my meaning herein. For a man therefore
requested to ride abroad on a rainy day with his friend, to say, I will ride, if
it hold up by noone, if it do not, I will not stir abroad: or for a man
being crossed casually by an Hare on his way, to conjecture thereby of the
event of his journey, and to determine thereupon of proceeding or stay, or of
this or that success in the same; there is in either of these cases a doubt
decided by a casualtie, but that not considered as a casualtie, but as having
otherwise a peculiar relation to the business intended, and the conueniency or
inconueniency of it effected by it in the one and presaged by it in the other,
and therefore making no Lotery: In which point also some of the former Authors
seem to fail, when they bring in (...) Delrio disq. mag. l. 4. c. 2. q. 7. 3.
divination by the flight of Fowls, and by their eating or refusing their food
under this head. But for a man pressed in that manner to accompany his friend,
to say, we will draw cuts whether we shall stay or go, or whether I shall go
with you or you stay with me, and put off your journey to some other time: or
being upon the way together, and disagreeing in opinion concerning the shaping
of their course, to refer the question and controversy between them to be
decided by the flight of the next Foul, or the footing of some Beast that has
gone before them on the way: here is matter of casualty regarded as it is
merely casual, and in that respect applied to decide the present doubt, which
no man therefore, I suppose, will deny to be Lotery indeed. And thus we see
what both a Lot and Lotery is in general, to wit, A Lot some casualty or event
merely casual purposely applied to the deciding of some doubt: and Lotery the
deciding or determining of some question or controversy by such casual events
considered as they are such.

CHAP. II. Of Chance or Casualtie, and of casual Events.
1. NOw because Chance or Casualty bears much sway in Lotery; Casual Events
being the subject matter of Lots; the due consideration thereof will help not a
little to the clearing of the nature of Lots and Lotery, and those Questions
that are moved concerning the same.

Concerning Chance therefore or Casualtie we will consider four things.

1. The name of it. 2. The nature of the thing so named. 3. Two distinct Acts
concurring in it. 4. And lastly, certain conclusions or aphorisms concerning
it.
First for the name or term of Chance or Casualtie, albeit it be by some
utterly condemned, and held foolish and heathenish; yet is it a term according
to the just analogy and proportion of Tongues and Languages, used by the Holy
Ghost himself in Gods book both in the Old and New Testament. In the Old
Testament by the pen of 1 Reg. 3.12. 2 Chronicles. 1.12.
Solomon, the wisest (of a mere man) that ever was since Adam, where he says,
that Eccles 9.11. (...) quod Plato de leg: l. 4 (...).
Time and Chance befalls all men, or all things: as also often Eccles. 9.2, 3.
(...) and 3.19. ter. and 2.14, 15 (...) casus acc^dit, vel conting^t.
els-where in that book. In the New Testament by the mouth of one infinitely
Matthew. 12.42.
greater and wiser than Solomon, 1 Cor. 1.24
the very power and wisdom of God, our Savior Christ himself, in the parable
of the Jew that journeying to Jericho fell among thieves, who as he lay wounded
half alive and half dead, a Priest is said to have Luke 10.31. (...).
come by Chance that way: where the Evangelist Luke to express in Greek what
our Savior spoke in Syriack, uses a word precisely answering (...) euenire,
contingere: vnde Graci^^ (...): sed and Lati^um curro, and occurro. Avenar. and
Guichard. and inde nomen (...).
an other used by Solomon, and springing (as may be probably surmised) from the
same root. I might add diverse other places, where this term is 1 King. 5.4.

ibid.
he repent himself in his Retractations that he named Chance or Fortune rather
so often in his writings; and it liked him not so well in regard of the abuse of
that name among the Heathen, who held Fortune for a blind Goddess, and
ascribed unto her what they should have given unto God; yet withal he
explaineth himself that Quamuis non Deam aliquam hoc nomine volnerim
intelligi, sed fortuitum rerum euentum. ibid.
he meant nothing thereby but the casual event of things; in which sense he
acknowledges that it may be well used, and grants that Vnde and illa ver b^

Religion condemns not, nor inhibiteth such kind of speeches, as to say,
Peradventure such a thing shall be, or, Perchance it may be, or, Such a thing

(...). Philo de cons^i^: Prine:
Chance and Casualty is indeed something, and may be defined a Contingencie or
uncertainty severed from forecast and foresight. Contingencie or uncertainty
I term it, to seclude it from necessity and certainty. For where necessity
is or certainty, there can be no Casualty; "Casualty and Certainty ever
expelling either other. I add, senered from forecast and foresight, to
distinguish casualty from such contingency, as is accompanied with either of
these twain, either directed by forecast, or determined by foresight, which
either of them both jointly and severally exclude casualty. Chance or casualty
thus conceived is an affection or adiunct both of efficients and of effects. In
regard of the former, it is by the (...). Epicur: (...). Anaxag: and St^ici.
(...). Plato. (...). Aristot: Vise Plutare: de philos: placit: l. 1. c. 29. and
Aristot: physic: l. 2. c. 4, 5. and Stob: l. 1. c. 10.
ancient Philosophers marshalled commonly among the causes in the rank of
Efficients, though some Adiunctum potius quam efficien^ dicenda videtur. Tal^us
in Ram: l. 1. c. 5. quod de Fat^ Aristot: (...). Stob: l. 1. c. 10.
later ones going more exactly to work, acknowledge it to be rather an
Affection of an Efficient, or an Adjunct manner of Efficiency than an efficient
cause of or in it self. In regard of the latter, Chance or Casualtie is by a
Trope ordinarily used to signify the Effect it self so affected: And so take
I it here, and consider it in the matter of a Lot, as the use of Authors well
warranteth it, and as Fortuna^ intellig^ fortuitu^ reru^ euentu^, Aug. retract:
l. 1. c. 1. Casus est euentus inopinatus. Boeth: consol: lib. 5. pros. 1. (...)

complectitur: interdum ver^ significat ili^^ it sum fortuitum euentum ab illa
causa per accidens manantem. Keckerm: system: Log. l. 1. c. 15.
Christian Writers in these Questions most usually understand it, for a Casual
Event, that is, an Event contingent, not directed or determined by any
forecast or foresight. A Contingent, I say, that is, an uncertain or
variable Event, as all grant it to be: And that again so uncertain as the
uncertainty of it is not directed or determined by the skill, counsel, or
forecast of him to whom it is casual; not that it is not effected and
produced by known natural causes, but that neither his skill or counsel has
any hand in the directing of those causes in the producing of that effect, nor
his forecast can determine what the effect will be in particular but by mere
conjecture only.

For the better conceiving hereof all Events may be referred to three heads:
(...). Anaxagor: apud Plut: piac: phil: l. 1. c. 29. (...) (m^le vulg^) (...)
(...). Amphion apud Aristot: rhetor: l 2. c. 19. (...). Plato de i^g: l. 10.
Est causa fortuita, est naturalis, est v^lunturia. Aug: ciu: l. 5. c. 10.
They are either Necessary, Contingent but not Casual, or Contingent and
Casual.

Necessarium est quod aliter se habere non po^^st. Kecker: system: l. 2. c. 3.
Hinc Thales, (...). Laert: vit: philos: and Flut: plac: l. 1. c. 25. (...).
^'ut. conviu: 7. Sap: and Grammatici (...). Etymol. and Eustath.
Necessary are such as fall out naturally always alike in a certain and
constant course, and cannot do otherwise, unless some supernatural power
countermand and overrule them, and the causes producing them: Such kind of
events are the motion of the Heavens, the course of the Sun, for the fire to
burn combustible matter cast into it, and the like. (...). Aristot: analyt:
pr: l. 1. c. 12. Contingens quod vel esse, vel non esse potest. Kecker: system:
l. 2. c. 3.
Contingent and not casual are such as are so done one way, as they may or
might have been done some other way, but that uncertainty is determined by the
knowledge, art, forecast, and skill, or by the advice, counsel, deliberation,
or free election of those whom they concern or befall: as for a man on his way
to go on or stand still, to go forward or backward, it being in his power and
determinable by his own will and advice to do the one or the other. Contingent
and casual are such Quid est aliud sors, quid fortuna, quid c^sus, quid
euentus, nisi came sic aliquid cecidit, sic euenit, vt vel no^^ cadere atque
euenire, vel aliter cadere aetque euenire potuerit? Cic: de divine: l. 2.
as might fall out in like sort diversely, and are (...). Aristot. analy^: pr:
l. 1. c. 12. (...). Aristot: physic: l 2. c. 5, 6. and 3.5 (...). Mena^d. apud
Stob: l. 1. c. 10.
not determined by any art or forecast, counsel or skill in regard of the
person to whom they are casual, or whom they casually befall. Thus for a man
travailing on the way, without forecast of ought in that kind, to epsy the
Eclipse of the Sun falling out at that instant in the river where he rides
in to water his horse: the Eclipse of the Sun here is natural and necessary,
his seeing or not seeing of it is contingent or voluntary, his espying it in
that place going in for no such end is merely casual and accidentary. Thus he
that slew Achab by casualtie, is said to have drawn his bow 1 King. 32.34.
(...) in integritate, sieve in simplicitate sua, nihil minus cogitans quam
Achab^ percutere. I^n.
in simplicity, intending, it seems, nothing less than that his arrow
should there light where it did, being shot out at all adventure by him, the
uncertain motion not directed or determined by the will or skill of the
shooter to the mark that it hit. So the slaughter of the person that is
casually slain, is said to be done Number: 35.22. (...) derepente. (...) absque
inimic^t^a. (...) non ^^ insidijs, sieve de industria. Iun:
suddenly, inconsiderately, not out of enmity, not of set purpose or by a
train, the party that did it (...) cum non videret eum: inconsiderate. Iun:
(...) nec malum eius quaereret. Number. 35.23.
not eying or seeing him, nor seeking his hurt whom he slew: all which terms
and phrases used by the Spirit of God in that case, tend not only to express
the uncertainty of the event, but to remove also all knowledge and counsel,
all foresight and forecast, whereby that uncertainty might be determined by
the party that was agent in that act.

3. Now in these casual events there are two things concurring, as generally
in all acts and events whatsoever. The one an act of the creature either
reasonable or unreasonable; of the reasonable either led merely by guess and
conjecture, as in drawing of cuts; or roauing at all adventure, as in taking
out of tickets shuffled and so blended together, that there is no place at all
left for guess; of the unreasonable either moving it self naturally but
uncertainly in regard of particular circumstances, as in divination by the
flight of Fowls, and by their feeding or refusing their food, or moved by some
other at all adventure, (for so far forth as any art or skill is used, so far
forth it is not casual) and that so as it may take diverse courses, or light
diversely, if it be but one, as when a blind man or one blindfolded shoots a
shaft at random; or when boys play at cross and pile; or they must of
necessity fall diversely though uncertain how, if they be many or more than
one,as where diverse dice or pawnes are cast out of the same box or hand, sundry
balls or bowls out of the same lap or arm. The other is an act of the
Creator, a providence or assistance either in general or special; and that
for the most part general and mediate in ordinary casualties, sometime
special and immediate in extraordinary events. A general providence, I say,
ordinarily, as in all other things: For the prescience and providence, or, if
you will, rather the will, pleasure, and omniscience of God extends it self
in general unto all things, even to Matthew. 10.29. Luk: 12.6.
the lighting of a sparrow, Matthew: 10.30. Act: 27.34. Luke 12.7. and 21.18.

Sen: prouid: c. 5.
God (says one well) is the author of all things, be they casual or other:
Aug: confess: l. 1. c. 10. Domine D ^, ordinator and creator rerum omni^m
naturalium, p^c^atoru^ autem tantum ordinator, no^ creator. Sic enim legendum,

adiutori ac remuneratori, malaru^ relictori and damnatori; vtrarum^ ordinatori
etc. Nisi forte cum Gomaro de prouid: c. 12. leg^re lubeat, Tantamm^do

author, I say, as an other well distingnisheth, of the action, though disposer
only not author of the evil, where any is, in it. If a providence of God
therefore in all things, then in casual events also: and as in all things, so
in casual events ordinarily, and no otherwise. If a Matthew: 10.29.
Sparrow fall not without Gods permission, much less is any man slain without
Gods providence, who is therefore said to Exodus: 21.13.
offer the man that is casually slain, unto the hand of him by whom he is
slain. In this regard well says Augustine, that Quae vulgo Fortuna
appellatur, occul^o quodam ordine regitur. Aug: retract: l. 1. c. 1.
That which is commonly called Chance, is yet by a certain course secretly
guided: and that Hoc totum, quod Forte, fortuito etc. d^cimus, ad diu^^a^

Even in those things that we say come by chance or by adventure, respect ought
to be had to a divine disposition. Yea in regard of this providence by
casualties often checking men's counsels, is it said by Solomon, that Eccles: 9.11.
The race goes not always with the swiftest, nor the battle with the
strongest, nor bread to the wisest, nor wealth to the skilfullest, nor grace to
the cunningest; but Time and Chance befalls them all. That which the Heathen

Gods providence by fortune, as much better another jumping almost in precise
terms with Solomon says, strikes a great stroke, and often carries things
acrosse to that we expect. Which as it is so in other casual events, so in
Lots among others; of which Solomon says therefore that Prou: 16.33.
The Lot is cast into the lap, but each disposition of it is of God. In which
speech the spirit of God by Solomon, as diverse Iun: No sortem quidem ipsam
caesu fortuito con^ingere, sed Deum prouidentia sua, qui^quid sor^e accid^t,
sigillatim disponere; quam and in infinitum rebus omnibus singulariter adhibet.

Divines of great, yea of good note expound him, implies but thus much, that
though nothing seem to be, or indeed is more casual than a Lot, where it is
carried as it ought, yet there is a divine providence in the disposition of it;
as there is the like also in all other events, of what nature and quality
soever they be. And therefore look what is said by Solomon of a Lot in that
place, the selfsame is said Prove. 19.21. and 16.1, 9. and 20.24. and 21.30,

elsewhere of all men's thoughts, and ways, and words, and works, and counsels,

not absolutely in our power to give issue to them as we will. Thus is it true
that A^gustine says, that Solent, quae sort dantur, diuinitum dari Aug: de
Ge^: ad lit: l. 10. c. 18.
Those things that fall to us by Lot, are given us from God: according to that
of the Psalmist, Psalm. 16.6, 7.
The lines are fallen to me in a pleasant place, and I have a fair heritage: I
praise the Lord for it. (Though that be spoken metaphorically not properly, as
the former words show, Ibid: verse: 5.
The Lord is the portion of my part and of my cup; and the maintainer of my
Lot.) But withal in like manner Prou: 10.22.
all wealth whatsoever, be it Frou: 19.14.
left by decease of friends, or got by Deuteronomy. 8.18.
travail and industry, or attained otherwise, and Psalm: 127.2.

a good wife, and Psalm: 127.3. Gen: 30.1, 2. Josh: 24.3, 4.
children are said to be Gods gifts, and to come all from him, who Act: 17.^5.
1 Timothy: 6.17.
gives all things to all, and Esai. 26.12.
works all things for all, and Ephesians: 1.11. Hebr. 13.21
in all.

Yet sometime there is a more special and immediate providence in
extraordinary cases and upon extraordinary occasions in these casual events,
as in the 2 King: 13.21.
casting of the man suddenly for fear of the enemy into the sepulcher of
Elisha, who by Gods admirable work to grace the blessed memory of his
faithful servant deceased, reviued thereupon: as in the Ion. 1.7.
Lot whereby Jonas was sometime discovered; done, as Hierome well says,
Deprehendebatur Jonas non viribus sortium, and maxim sortibus Ethnicoru^, sed
voluntate eius qui sorts regebat inceri^^. Hieron. in Ion: c. 1.
not by virtue of the Lot it self, much less of a Lot used by Heathen and
Infidels, but by his will and providence that ruled, or rather ouer-ruled the
uncertainty of it. And in this case is that true, which Bernard says, that Qui
nobi^ casus videtur, serm^ qu^dam Dei est, suam nobi^ indicans voluntat^m.
^ern. de diverse: ^erm. 26.
That which seems Chance to us, is as a word of God acquainting us with his
will. That which is true indeed in general, if we consider Gods decreeing will
of whatsoever comes to pass: for we know that it was Gods will it should be
so, when we see it once fallen out so, and his will is manifested by his work,
either for the doing of the thing it self, or for the permitting of it to be
done. Otherwise if it be further understood of the manifestation of Gods
approving will concerning somewhat to be done or left undone of us, it is not
true in the general. For what word of God is there showing his will in this
kind and this sense, when an Hare starteth out before a man in the way, or a
Foul flies beside him, or he treads in some unclean thing unawares, and
the like, more than in any other act whatsoever? unless we will give way to
their De quibu^ latissi^ie I^an: Sarisber: in policrat: sieve de nugis Curial:
l. 1. c. 12.
superstitious and frivolous conceits, that make such accidents ominous.
Howbeit of extraordinary Lots cast by special instinct or express appointment
of God, it is most true, and of such may well be understood those speeches of
other of the Ancients, who call Lotery Sors veluti diuino pendet examine.
Ambr: de Tob: c. 20.
a divine trial, and Electi sunt duo iudicio humano, and electus de duobus
vnus iudicio diuino. Aug: in Psalm: 30. de Matthia Act: 1.26.
a divine sentence: and say that Quae Dei voluntas continet in occulto sors
homin^bus declaraet in manifesto. Origeu: in Josh: hom: 23.
a Lot discovers to men Gods hidden will; and Dei iudicium, quod est in
occulto, sors pandit in publico. Ibid.
makes it known openly what God judges secretly: as also that Sors res est
in dubitatione humana diuina^ indicans voluntat^m. Aug: in Psalm: 30.
A Lot is a matter in man's doubting manifesting Gods will. Which sayings all,
if they be understood of Gods approving will what he would have done or not
done of us, must of necessity be restrained to such Lots alone as God himself
shall by some special means appoint to be used to that purpose.

4. From that which has been said, and already laid as a ground, may certain
conclusions be deduced concerning casual Events.

The first conclusion: It is idle in matter of Casualty, and so of Lotery, to
confound the act of the Creator with the work of the creature; they being two
several things distinct in themselves, which ought not therefore to be
confounded in casual events more than in any other whatsoever. Yet thus many
seem to do, and those men of some note, when they say, that Fors five fortuna
idem est quod (...); sed differun^ ratione significandi. Scalig: de subtle:
exerc. 307. 25.
Fortune or Chance is the same with Gods providence, and that they differ only
in respect: as also, that Triae ha^, Prouidentia, Fatum, Fortuna idem sunt
reipsa: ratione tamen ita disting^untur, vt prouidentiae quasi t^tum videatur,
reliqua vero^ dua parts, nam prouidentia omniu^ causa est qua fiunt; cade^
autem respectu little quae necessario fiun^, ^Fatum, respectu vero coru^ quae
fortuito fieri videntur, Fortuna appellatur. D^unam: in R^m: dial: l. 1. c. 5.
Providence, Fate or Destiny, and Fortune or Casualtie are in truth the same;
yet so to be distinguished, that the first includes the two latter: For that
Providence is the cause of all things that are done; which Providence in
respect of things done necessarily is called Fate or Destiny, in respect of
things done casually is called Fortune or Casualtie. And therefore Quod
sapientibus and pijs singulari^ Dei prouid^ntia est, id ins^pientibus and
prophanis Fortuna dicitur. Ibid.
That (say they) which to the wise and godly is Gods singular Providence, to
the foolish and profane is Fortune or Chance. The very like hereunto says
Lactaentius of nature, (as before him Quid aliud est Nae^ura quam Deus, and
diuina ratio toti mundo and paertib^^ eiu^ inserta. Sen: de benef: l. 4. c. 7.
Ne^ Natura sine Deo est, nec Deus sine Natura, sed id (...) est virumque; nec

ca^itas, and vt Cicero ait (Academ: quest: l. 1.) ignoratio causarum Natura ac

ignorance of causes brought in the names of Nature and Fortune. And again,
Hae^ Religionis euers^^ Natura nomen invenit. etc. Ibid. c. 28.
This overthrow of piety brought in Natures name: For when men knew not by whom
the world was made, or would persuade men that nothing was made by the Deity;
they said that Naturam esse rerum omnium matrem, quasi sua sponte nata sint.
Ibid.
Nature was the mother of all things, as if they should say that all things had
sprung up naturally of themselves; which word while they use, they confess
their own folly: Since Natura (remotae prouidentia and potestate diuina)
prorsu^ nihil est. Lactant. ibid.
Nature, severed from the divine power and providence, is just nothing. And the
like error commit they when they define Fortunam D^ a^ quaendam vo^ humanas
varijs casibus illudentem. etc. Ibid.
Fortune a certain Goddess which by sundry casualties sporteth her self with
defeating of men's purposes, because they understand not from whom those good or
evil things come that befall them. It is true indeed, (as a Mornae: de verit:
relig: Christ: c. 13.
worthy man says answering that objection of Atheists and Epicures, what will
become of Fortune if there be a divine Providence in all things?) that if we
speak of Fortune, as the Fortuna^ insana^ esse and cacam and brutam perhibent
Philosophi, saxoque illam instare globoso praedicant volubili. Ideo quo saxu^
impulerit fors, cadere eo fortunam autumant. Caecam ob came rem esse iterant,
quia nihil cernit quo sese applicet. Insaena^ autem ai^nt, quia atrox, incerta,
instabilisque fit. B^utam, quiae dignum atque indignum nequeae^ internoscere.

may as easily be done out by us as it is drawn by them: or else at the best a
symbolicall emblem deciphering out the great uncertainty of casual events, of
which we shall say more anon. And again it is no less true that the same
Morn: ibid: voi sup:
Author says, that if by Fortune with Proclus, we understand a divine power
coupling causes together which would of tiarre otherwise, that they may work
to one and the same end; then are we to acknowledge such a power and providence
not in Non in vagi^ tantum incertisqua quibusdam, sed in ce^tissimis, and in
omnibus.
casual things and such as are uncertain alone, but in all other whatsoever,
even those that be most certain. For Deus ipse est ali^ nomine designatus.
Ibid.
Fortune is no other than but God nicnamed. But if we consider the term of
Nature, and so of Fortune or Chance, as the Holy Ghost uses them; as Nature is
a power or faculty in the creature distinct from Gods providence guiding and
ruling, yea and often ouer-ruling the same to such ends as he sees good: so is
Fortune or Chance also an affection or action of the creature distinct from the
same providence whereby God likewise guides and disposes the same at his
pleasure. As in natural effects therefore there is the work of the creature,
which might be albeit there were no providence disposing it, but the creature
for matter of direction were left wholly to it self: so is there the like also
in casual events; which as they do now fall out, and yet are ordered, as all
other things, by Gods providence either general or special; so would no doubt
fall out the same oft-times that now they do, were there no providence at all,
but the creature left to it own work and will. In regard whereof the
Scholeman not unfitly says, that Diuisoria Sor^ locu^ habere posset, etiamsi
res humana fortuito agerentur. Thom: de sortib: c. 5.
there might be some use of some kind of Lot, although there were no providence
at all to guide it, for that Conting^t alique^ diuisoria Sort vti, non quas^
requirat iudicium diuinum, sed quasi committens fortunae; quod maxim videtur
in lud^ taxillatori^. Thom: ibid.
in the same, the decision of the matter in question is referred wholly, as we
shall see after, to the casual motion of the creature, without any special
providence of the Creator required thereunto. In a word, if in casual events
we consider ought beside the ^^ature and the uncertain motion thereof,
(uncertain (I say) to us, because not determinable by us, though determined
ordinarily by some natural cause or other:) there is nothing guiding them but
Gods providence: which two things, the act of the creature, and Gods providence
accompanying it, though never sundred or severed, yet are to be distinguished
and distinctly considered, and not to be confounded the one with the other.

5. A second conclusion: The casualtie of an event does not simply of it self
make it a work of Gods special or immediate providence. It is apparent: for
there is oft-times a more special providence in many things that are not
casual but contingent only, then in the most things that are casual. How many
casual events daily befall us, even as many almost as we meet with men, or
tread steps on our way, when every cast of our eye ministers new variety of
casualtie, and every unexpected object brings a casual event with it; which
yet no man will be so senseless as to account so many several works of
special or immediate providence? And yet some one contingent event only among
many other merely casual may be so, when they are not. For example; for a man
on his way to be crossed often by an Hare, to meet with many unknown, find a
piece of old iron, spy a couey of Partridges, have his hat blown of his head,
and the like, may well befall a man and be all merely casual. But for a man's
friend out of suspicion of danger and forecast of distress that his friend may
incur, to enforce his com^any upon him, whereas otherwise he should travail
alone and is desirous so to do, and being in company with him to be a means
of saving his life by recovery upon a fall, or by rescue upon assault, were an
event contingent rather than casual. And yet who would not acknowledge a more
special providence of God in the latter that is less casual, or rather not
casual at all but contingent only, deliberatory and voluntary, undertaken
upon mature counsel and forecast, than in the former, that are or may be
merely casual, and fall out beyond all expectation, without any forcecast at
all?

It is true indeed that Gods providence is more manifested in things casually
befalling us for good or evil, than in things that befall us contingently by
means of men and their forecast and affection to us, or their hatred and
malice; as more in things that fall out contingently, than in things that are
necessary. Howbeit the providence of God ordinarily extends it self to all
of them alike, and is more special sometime in some things not casual than in
others that are such. Yea in the same event either casual or other may a more
special providence of God be justly deemed to be at some time than at other in
regard of circumstances concurring: as for a man traveling over Salisbury
plain to find a pitcher of water left occasionally there, having no need of
it or use for it, no man, I suppose, would expound as a special providence of
God: But for a man exceedingly vexed with thirst, extremely distressed, as
Judge: 15.1^.
Sampson sometime, and ready to die for want of water to drink, to light on
the like booty casually, as Genes. 21.19.
Hagar was directed by Gods Angel to a Well, he would have just cause to
esteem it to have a special providence of God in it, and might well term the
place where he should so find it, as she did an other place where Gods Angel
found her, (...) puteus viuentis (Dei) videntis me. Genes. 16.14.
Beer lachai roi, or the Well of the living God that looked after me when I was
near lost. No man not fondly superstitious would account so of the one; and no
man not grossly impious but would judge so of the other: yet both equally
casual: the casualtie of events therefore does not of it self simply adjudge
them to either.

6. A third conclusion: That may be casual to one that is not casual to
another; where there is forecast and foreknowledge and counsel foreseeing or
directing and disposing it in the one, and not in the other: and that may seem
such, which indeed is not. For the better conceiving hereof we are to consider
that in casual events two things do concur, (...) Aristot: physic: l. 2. c
4. Fort^ita quae sunt, ^ulla nec art nec sapientia praevideri p^ssunt. Cic.
diuinat: l. 2.
ignorance or want of fore-knowledg foreseeing them, and inconsideratenes, or
want of forecast directing them: for these things make the event of them
uncertain to us: and uncertainty breeds casualty. Yet is not that all out
true here that some say, that Ignoratio ^ausarum confinxit fortuna^. Lactant:
instit: l. 3. c. 29. and Ram: dialect: lib. 1. c. 5. ex Cicer: quast. Academ:
l. 1.
Ignorance of causes forged the term of Chance or Fortune: and that Nihil
aliud in rebus casum vocamus, nisi cuius ratio and causa secreta est. Aug:
contra Academ: l. 1. ^. 1.
Chance is nothing but that, the cause whereof, or means whereby it is
effected, is hid from us. For many things we know not the cause of, which yet
we ascribe not to chance, neither indeed are they casual; but some of them are
necessary, as that the Lodestone should attract iron and steel, and direct
the needle touched with it Northward, etc. no known cause or certain reason
can be rendered of either; and yet are they necessary and natural, not casual
events: some only contingent, as the return of Ague fits in an ordinary
course is not casual, to speak properly, but contingent only at the most,
even to such a one as out of ignorance of the true cause and ground of its
recourse in that manner, suspecteth it to be some kind of spirit. Again many
things there are and come to pass daily, which we know the causes of, and yet
are they casual to us, because they were not foreseen by us: as when an Hare
started by hounds crosses a man tra^ailing on some other occasion; though he
be neither ignorant of the cause of his own journey that way, nor of the cause
of the Hares crossing the way at that instant, yet may it be casual to him
that an Hare then and there should cross him: whereas if a man knew
beforehand what would fall out or befall him on the way, nothing then that did
betide him should be casual unto him. Thus then may the same thing be casual
to one, that is not so to another; because it was foreseen and fore-knowne by
the one and not by the other: as 1 Samuel 10.2, 3* ^, 10.
Saul's meeting them that Samuel had foretold him of before, was casual to them
he met, not casual to Samuel and Saul himself, the one that foresaw it by
revelation from God, the other that fore-knew by relation from him.

Again, all counsel and forecast is excluded from casual events. Nothing
that is done by advice, counsel or forecast, is done casually in regard of
him that so does it. Quiequid cas^ fit, te^^re fit. Aug: 83 q^^st. 24.
What is done casually is done unadvisedly, says Augustine. And In cas^
temeritas, non ratio (...) consiliu^ vali^, C^^: divine: l. 2.
Temeritie swaieth in casualty, not reason or advice, as we have formerly
showed. In regard whereof we use to say of those that speak inconsiderately
and deal unadvisedly and inconstantly, that Reliqua sic a me aguntur and
agentur, vt noncommittamus vt ^a quae gessimus, fortuito gessif^e videamur.
Ci^: ad Attic: l. 1. ep. 15. Non c^mmittam, vt quae gessi, casu m^gu and

they deal as if they dealt by casualtie, (...). Xenoph. paed l. 1.
or went by Lotery; that they speak^ as Hoc no^ est confiderare, sed quasi
sortiri quid loquare. Cic: de not: De^r: l. 1.
if they drew cuts what they should say. And thus again may that be casual to
one that is not so to another, because it is beside the intent and purpose of
the one and not of the other. Thus was 1 King. 21.20.
Ahabs meeting Elias casual to Ahab, but not casual to Elias, who went of
purpose to meet Ahab: thus Judge. 11.34
Iephtaes meeting his daughter and she him, was casual to him who expected
her not, not casual to her whose purpose was to meet him.

Yea thus many things seem casual when indeed they are not; (...). de

state to couple persons together by a slight and semblance of lotery, that
they might seem to light either on other by lot or by chance, when indeed it
was done by their cunning and slight. Thus Darius his horses neighing after the
mare which he had been with lately before in that place, seemed casual to his
competitors, who before (...). Herodot: l. 3. Viam invenerunt, qua de se

to his groom who had laid the train before for it. A^etius proble^: cl^s. 1.
loc. 57.
Thus a man sends his servant on an errand through such a lane, where he
knows that he shall meet his mistres coming from market laden with meat;
they meet accordingly the one not expecting the other, and suppose they meet
casually, when indeed it is no casualty, but the good man's care forecasting it
for the ease of his wife. Morna: de verit: relig: Christ: c. 13.
Thus the servant lights on money, that his master has laid of purpose as a
bait to try his honesty withal, whether he will restore it or retain it, and
thinks it came there casually, where it was purposely disposed. And of this
kind, in a word, is all co^en and cunning conueyance used in Lots to make that
seem casual that indeed is not, but is carried by slight; a thing so common in
such courses, that among the Dutch it is reported to be grown to a byword, In
Lotery is Bouery, that is, knavery or cosenage. Now howsoever in such cases the
ignorance of causes makes those things seem casual that indeed are not so;
yet to speak properly, it is rather the ignorance of events, as in the former
cases, that makes things indeed casual unto any; by means whereof it comes
often to pass, that the same events are casual to some that foresaw them not,
and yet not casual to others that foresaw them before: and so it is true, that

all things necessarily in regard of him and his decree. If we respect indeed
the creature, and its manner of working, some things come to pass necessarily,
some contingently, some casually. But if we respect Gods will and purpose, his
praescience and providence, nothing falls out contingently or casually, but
all things come to pass necessarily. Nothing contingently: for in contingency
is uncertainty: but Apud Deum quippe iam factam est, quod ei^^ dispositione

We are as men on the way, that see who go before them or with them, but see
not who come behind them: God is as one standing aloft on a sentinel, that
sees all both before and behind under one view at one instant. That which the
Psalmist seems to allude unto when he says, that Psalm: 33.13, 14, 15. (...).
Soph^^l: Electr.
God looks down from heaven and sees all Adams sons; from his place of
abode he viewes all the inhabitants of the world: and as he framed and
fashioned the hearts of each of them, so he takes notice of all their works.
God therefore foreseeing all things ere any of them are, there can none of them
fall out casually in regard of his Majesty. But needs must he foresee all
things even ere they are, when there is nothing that he does not ever see: and
Omni^ fi^^^ videt, quorum nullum est quod non semper vid^t. Aug: trinit: l. 15.
c. 14. Deus omnia semp^^ videt and simul. Lomb: sent: l. 1. d. 39. D.
there is nothing but he ever sees it, that sees all things at once.

Again, in regard of God can nothing come casually, because by his providence
and eternal counsel all things are guided and governed, and ordered by him to
such ends as he sees best himself. So that even Apud Deum ordinata sunt,
eti^m quae in se maxim inordinata vide^tur. Vise Aug: de ordin: l. 1. c. 4, 5.
and 83. quaest. 27.
those things that seem most disorderly in themselves, yet are ordered with
him. For not only Ephesians: 1.11. Heb: 13.2^.
the best things are all effected and wrought by him; but even Act: 2.23. and
3.18. and 4 27, 28.
the worst and the wickedest are all so ordered and disposed by his eternal
counsel and unsearchable wisdom, that Per cande^ creaturae voluntatem qua

Deus de eis qui faciunt quae no^ vult, facit ipse quae vult. Idem de corrept:

even by those that do what he wills not but forbids, he fulfilleth what
he wills. Nothing therefore coming to pass but what God foreseeth, what God
foredecreeth, what he has foreknowne, and what he has foreordained, there
can nothing come casually in regard of God; casualty necessarily excluding all
foreknowledge and forecast. That which the Heathen man of old foresaw when he
said, that (...) Hippocr; apud Stob: Omnia Deo certa, nobis multa fortui^a. 1

Nothing was casual with God, though many things were with man. In which sense
are we to take Augustine, where he reasons thus against casualty; Qaicquid
casu fit, temere fit. quicquid temere fit, non fit prouidentia. si ergo casu
aliqua fiunt in mundo, non prouideniia vniuersus mundus administratur. Aug: 83.
quaest. 24.
whatsoever is done by casualtie, is done unadvisedly: whatsoever is done
unadvisedly, is done without forecast or foresight: if ought therefore in the
world come to pass casually, the whole world is not administered by forecast or
foresight. Which argument or ground of his simply considered Tam contingentiam
q^am cas^m excludit. Calvin: iustit: l. ^. c. 16. 9.
might exclude as well all contingencie in regard of uncertainty, as all
casualty in events, but must of necessity be understood of the events of
things only as they regard God; with whom, because he fore-seeth all things
before they fall out, and fore-determineth all things how they shall fall out,
none of those events are casual, that are most casual unto us, none
contingent of those many that are contingent unto us.

CHAP. III. Of the several Sorts of Lots.
1.THus much then shall suffice to have spoken of the definition of a Lot, and
of Casual Events, whereof a Lot is one, in general: we will now proceed to
consider of the several Sorts and Kinds of it.

In the division of Lots therefore I find much diversity among Writers, some
referring all to two heads, some to three, some to four, some to more,
uncertain how many.

Lyra in Num^ c. 34. and in ^rou^. c. 16. and in Iome. 1. diuisoria ad aliquid
inter plu^es di^idendum; consultoria ad aliquid determina^e agendu^.
Lyra makes but two sorts of Lots, diuisorie, used for the dividing of
something between diverse; and consultorie, for the determining of somewhat to
be done. The former, says he, lawful and free from offense, if without greedy
desire of gain the event be committed to the chance or the casual motion of
the creature: the latter unlawful, if the event of it be expected from any
created power beside the casual act of the creature, as from the motion of
Planets, or the operation of evil Spirits; not unlawful if it be expected
from God or good Angels, so it be done in case of necessity, with due
reverence, and out of Ecclesiastical Elections.

Lavat: in Prou. c. 16. diuis^riae, licitae, qusbus hereditares, possessiones,
praedae, etc. diuiduntur; diuinatoriae illicitae, quibus occulta investigantur,
quisue reru^ aut personaris futuru^ fit exitus.
Lavater likewise, and Schindler: ^n l^x. pentaglos:
Schlinder make two sorts, but in different terms, diuisorie and diuinatorie:
diuisorie, used (as before) for division of possessions, legacies, spoils,
offices, exercises, employments, and the like, and these lawful and
commendable: diuinatorie, used for the finding out of hidden and unknown
truths, and the foretelling of future events, and these unlawful and damnable.
The consultorie Lot they think to be included in the two former, though not
the same simply with either.

Serar: in Josh: ^om: 2 c 7. q. 17. Sort vel cognitio quaeritur sola
praeteritorum, praesentium, futurorum; and est diuinatoria; vel actio eti^m
quaecunque subconsilium and deliberatione^ cadere potest; and est consultoria:
ad quem diuisoria revocari potest.
Serarius again makes two sorts another way, consultorie, and diuinatorie:
For that, says he, that by a Lot is sought out, is either the bare knowledge
of things past, present or future; or beside the knowledge of something any
action whatsoever that may come within compass of deliberation and counsel;
that is done by a diuinatorie, this by a consultorie Lot: the diuisorie Lot may
be referred, he thinks, to this latter.

2. Thom: sum part: 2^. 2 ^.q. 95. art 8. and de sortib: cap. 2, 3, 4.
Diuisoria qua quaeritur, quid cui fit exhibendum; Consultoria, qua quaeritur,
quid sit agendum; Diuinatoria, qua quaeritur, quid fit futurum.
Thomas Aquinas makes three sorts, diuisorie, consultorie, and diuinatorie:
diuisorie, determining what each one shall have; consultorie, inquiring what
were best to be done; and diuinatorie, searching what shall hereafter ensue. In
these, says he, the event is expected, either from the stars, and that false
and vain; or from chance alone, as in the diuisorie, and that not wholly free
from some vanity; or from some spiritual cause directing it, and that either
the Devil, and that wicked, or God, and that of it self not evil; yet such
as may become sinful, if Lots be used, upon no necessity, without due
reverence, with abuse of divine oracles, or in Ecclesiastical offices:
otherwise in case of necessity it being lawful with due reverence to implore
by Lot a divine sentence. In his steps tread most of your Ludouic: de Pruss:
trilog: animae part. 3. cap. 21. Henr: Herp: spec: aur: de praecep: 1. ser: 4.

Popish Writers; save that some of them, as Caietan: summa peccat: de Sort.
Caietan, and Tolet: sum: cas: conse: l 4. c. 15.
Tolet restrain these cautions to the consultorie Lot only; some of them with

Malderus, and Delrio disq. mag: l. 4. c. 3. q 7. 4. consultoria aeque a^

Delrio condemn utterly all both consultorie and diuinatorie Lots, save in
case of special either command or instinct, Mald: and Delr: ibid: c. 4. q. 1.
allowing the diuisorie wheresoever, being used without wrong or injury to
any. And of ours, Martyr in 1 Samuel c. 10.
Peter Martyr, as he sets down the same sorts, so he passes in a manner
the same censure upon them: that to expect the event of them from Chance or
Fortune is frivolous, from evil spirits superstitious, from planets
ridiculous, from God alone religious, and only lawful, so that used in case
of necessity, reverently and religiously, without superstition, without fraud
or collusion, and without abuse of divine oracles.

Paucer: de diuinat: c. de sort.
Peucer and Kr^kevitz in Ion. c. 1. Sortilegium triplex; diuinum, diuinitus
rectum and directum; civil, seu politicu^; diuinatorium and superstitiosum.
Krakevitz make three sorts also, but in another sort: Lots divine, guided and
governed immediately by God; such as godly men used upon Gods special
command, not warranted now to us: Civil or politic used for the ending of
strife and lawsuites, or the parting of goods, gifts, and legacies, or the
collation of some honors and offices; which may lawfully be used with mutual
consent, and without couen and fraud: and Diuinatorie or superstitious, whereby
men presume upon idle grounds, neither warranted by Gods word, nor founded on
natural reason, to find out hidden truths, and guess at future events; a
course Satanicall, and in Scripture expressly forbidden.

Perkins of Witchcraft.
Perkins again makes three sorts with some new alteration: civil or
politic, used for the dividing of bargains etc, to end strife; sporting,
used commonly for the setting up of banckrupts; divining, used for the
foretelling of future events: The first warrantable used in cases of weight and
necessity, with invocation of Gods name; the two latter notable abuses, having
no warrant in Gods word.

3. Eas^y history of Gospel.
Easty only makes four sorts; divine, appointed and commanded to be used by
God; diabolical, for divination, condemned of all; political, for choice of
Magistrates in cases of war, tolerated by many; ludicrous, for sport and
pastime, questioned by most: and by himself disallowed.

Lastly Serarius, besides his former division; and another of Serar: in Josh:
^om: 2. c. 7. q 17. Sors soria, lus^ria.
serious and lusorious; as also those that diverse others have, of Permissa,
prohibita. Greg: Tolos: de appell: l. 2. c. 19.

many others to small purpose, drawn from the great variety and diversity of
workers about them, instruments used in them, matters disposed by them, the
manner how, the places where, the times wherein they were used, and the like.

4. But leaving these and the like diverse and disagreeing divisions to their
several Authors crossing the one thus the other: we will assay (if it may be)
to give somewhat a fuller, and more exact distribution; at least fitter and
more commodious for the business here intended, then the most of them have
done.

Lots therefore may be all well referred to two heads, and sorted into two
ranks, either of Ordinary, of which kind those are which they commonly term
Diuisorie; or of Extraordinary, such as the Consultorie and Diuinatorie are:
the Ordinary may be subdivided into Serious and Lusorious; and these again
distinguished by sundry differences as occasion shall require.

CHAP. IV. Of Ordinary Lots serious.
1. TO begin then with the former sort: Ordinary Lots I call those whose full
work may be effected by the ordinary or natural power of the creature using
them and used in them: or wherein no extraordinary power or providence is
required for the direction of the action to that end whereunto it is applied.

Of this kind are all those Lots that are merely Diuisorie, wherein the matter
in question and controversy is ever such as may well be decided by the casual
motion or event of the creature, being committed thereunto by those in whose
power it is to dispose of it, without any special providence or extraordinary
means required for the directing of the action in this or that manner: which
kind of Lots may be termed also Civil or profane Lots, taking the word
profane, as it is opposed to Sacred, in the better sense. Where comes to be
controlled their definition of a Lot, who define a Aret: probl: ^las: 1. loc.

Lot to be a kind of consulting with God of rare use, yet lawful to be used in
such accidents, where neither reason nor humane advice can conveniently be had.
For there is nothing less than any consulting with God in such Lots as we now
speak of, there being no cause, nor reason, nor ground, nor occasion so to do:
seeing there is neither any question concerning Gods will, what he would have
done or not done, nor any thing to be done that in regard of the difficulty of
doing it, requires any special aid and assistance or divine presence or
providence, more than any other ordinary act and affair of this life. For
there is nothing expected or required in these Ordinary, Civil, Diuisorie
Lots, but what is in the natural power of the creature therein used, the will
and consent of the creature making use of it concurring, as easily to effect,
as for a man that has his lims to walk, or that has his sight to see: that
which may evidently appear upon a diligent view of the several examples
hereafter ensuing.

2. These Ordinary Lots again are of two sorts, either Sors seria, lusoria.
Serar: in Josh: tom: 2.^ 7. q. 17.
Serious or Lusorious. Serious I call such as are used in serious business, be
it great or small, weighty or light, so as not matter of mere sport or delight
alone, which is the Lot that some of the former Authors term the Diuisorie
Lot, in regard of the frequent use of it in division of lands, goods, chatels,
bargains, exercises, offices, employments, and the like: And that of which
Solomon speaks where he says, that Prove. 18.18.
The Lot stinteth strifes, and makes partition among the mighty.

Now of this kind of Lot there is great variety of Examples as well in Holy
Writ as in profane Writers. And we may observe them to have been used either
for distribution of matters of Office and Charge, or for division of
possessions and lands, of goods and chatels, or the like.

Matters of Office or Service and Charge distributed by Lot have been either
Sacred or Civil.

For the former: to pass by that bold fancy of Origin: in Josh: l. ^m: 23.

To pass, I say, from these fond figments to the truth of story. Sacred
Offices, for the readier manner of performance and more orderly execution of
them were in the Jewish Church divided by Lot.

3. The divisions of Sacred Offices made among them by Lot were either General
or Special.

In General, the whole body of the Tribe of Levi was by Lot sorted out into
rancks.

For first, 1 Chronicles. 24.5. ad 20.
the Priests were all divided into twenty four companies according to their
families, which took their courses by turns, every week after week in
order; the order of their courses being determined by Lot, Vt t^lleretur
ma^eria querimoniarum. Bella^m: de ^leric: l. 1. c. 5.
to take away all murmuring, that none might complain, as being less regarded
and cast behind others.

And again, 1 Chronicles. 25.8, etc. ad finem.
the Levites that were no Priests were likewise divided into 24 companies,
appointed to attend the former companies of Priests; who, which, and when, was
decided likewise by Lot; all great and small submitting themselves alike to
that sentence, that there might be no contention nor emulation amongst them.

In particular for the Priests that were of each company, and were to serve at
the same time, there were Populares v^iu^ ephemeriae partiebantur inter se
ministeria. In libr^ Liturgiarum, Dicit illis praefectus, I^gredimini; Et
sor^iebantur quis i^molaret, quis sparger^t, quis cin^r^ l^vares altar

emend: temp: lib. 6. c. 1. Vise and Car: Sigon: de repub: Hebr: lib. 5. cap. 2.
and Ia^nsen: harmon: Euang: c. 2.
Lots cast by them likewise for the sharing of Offices among themselves (partly
to avoid confusion and contention; for 1 Cor: 14.33.
God is a God of order and peace; and partly the better to settle the service;
sithence (...) Aristot: polit: l. 2. c. 2. Qu^d ab omnibus curatur, a nemine

no man commonly regards that that is every man's charge) who should tend the
Altar of Incense, who the Table of holy bread, who the dressing of the Lamps,
who the Altar of Burnt offerings, who should feed the Fire, who should carry
out the Ashes etc. as by the books of the Jewish Liturgies is reported plainly
to appear. And thus is that place of the Evangelist Luke to be understood,
where it is said of Zachary, that being of the Course of Abia, and serving in
his Course, Luc: 1.9. (...) etc. vt supra, Ad suffi^um ingredimini and
sorlimini.
he went by Lot in to burn Incense: A place for want of this observation
misunderstood by many of the Ancients, who (to let pass here the repetition
of de Pontific^ sort^ designato.

Christi. Aug: in Iean: tr: 49. Ambr: Bed: E^thym in Luc: c. 1.
supposing Zachary to have been High Priest (which Vise Joseph: antiq: l. 20.
c. 8. Scalig: amend: temp: l. 6. c. 1. Baron: annal: in appar: Eastie histor:

it is apparent he was not; for the High Priest was of no particular course,
nor lived from Jerusalem, but had his employment constant, and his abode
continual about the Temple:) and to have gone in then to burn incense for the
Levit: 16.12, 13, 14, 15, 29, and 23.27.
solemn Fast of Atonement, Hebr. 9.7.

blood also, and that but once in the year, into the innermost Sanctuary,

other later ones of great note, upon grounds as uncertain, would reduce it to

But to return to our Task: As the Priests shared the services among
themselves by Lot: so the Levites likewise, as well those that were 1 Chronicles:
25.8, etc ad finem.
Singers, as those that were 1 Chronicles: 26.13, etc. ad 20.
Porters, decided by Lot, what order of course should be observed in their
musical and ministerial employment by the one, and which gates of the Temple
should be waited at and attended by the other. Among whom also those that were
to wait in the same place, being many in number, (...). Philo de honor. sacerd.
are reported likewise to have taken their turns by Lot, as well for the Psalm:
134.1.
nightly watch, as for the daily ward. The 1 Chronicles: 6.31. and 23.4, 5, 6. and
25.1, etc ad 7. 2 Chronicles. 8.14. and 29.5.
Offices themselves were, it seems, distributed, who should be Singers, who
Porters, etc. by David, Nathan, and Gad, with other principal persons
assisting them, having warrant so to do from God: (...). De Mose Philo de
constit. princ.
only the order and course of their imploiment in those offices was divided
unto them, or decided and determined among themselves upon joint consent and
general agreement, by Lot.

And hence arises the phrase used by Simon Peter to Simon Magus, Act. 8.21.
(...).
Thou have neither share, not Lot in this business, Which speech yet no more
proves what that bastard Prochorus broached, that the Apostles shared among
themselves by Lot: no more then Gods commanding Elias 1 King. 19.16.
to annoint Elizeus Prophet in his own place, (which was done, as the story
shows, not by pouring oil on his head, but 1. King. 19.19. Vide Piscat notas
ad cum lo^um.
by casting a mantle on his back) proves that Prophets were either
ordinarily, or at all anointed in the time of the Old Testament; (an opinion
without sufficient ground generally received;) or that annoynting of Kings was
ever usual in Persia, because Esai 45.1.
Cyrus is termed the Lords anointed; or that material oil was powered upon
our Savior to that purpose, because he is called Psalm. 2.1. Joan. 1.41. and
20.31.
Christ and Messiah, and is said to have Esai 61.1. Psalm. 45.7. Act. 4.27. and
10.38.
been anointed by God. But, as to annoint is there put for solemnly to set
apart and appoint, where yet there is no material annoynting at all, because
into Exodus 40.13.15. Leu. 8.12 30. 1. Sam. 10.1. and 16.13.
some sacred Offices men were sometime by that Ceremony enstalled: so is a Lot
here used for right or interest to deal in that holy business, which yet was
not, save in Act. 1.26.
Matthias his case, disposed of by Lot, because sacred Offices or employments
had sometime been thereby distributed.

Thus Persecutionis te^pore; qui mamant, ne fuga fiat omniti; qui fugiant, no
morte eorum deseratur Ecclesia; sort legendi sunt. Aug. Epist. 180.
Augustine would have it determined by Lot among the Pastors of Gods people,
where diverse are in one City, in time of public persecution: who of them
should stay by it, and who should retire and reserve themselves for better
times; that so neither those that stayed might be taxed of presumption, nor
those that retired themselves be condemned of cowardice. As also Baro in Ion.
c. 1.
it is reported by some to be the practice to this day in the Church of Geneua,
that by Lots cast among their Ministers, some of them are assigned to vi^it the
infected at the Pesthouse in times of general infection by epidemicall
diseases.

4. Now as in assignement of sacred Offices, so in distribution of civil
Services and matter of charge, have Lots among Gods people been ordinarily
used. Two Examples especially are found of it in Scripture.

The former in a Military matter: where in the Levites Judge. 20 9.10.
quarrel, that had his Concubine ravished, so that she died upon it at Gibea
in Benjamin: the other Tribes of Israel resolve to go up against the
Beniamites their brethren by Lot: which yet is not so to be conceived, as if by
Lot it should be determined which Tribe of the eleven should first go up
against them: (for they are said to have Judge. 20.18.
asked of the Lord at Shilo, and of the Priest that stood before him there,
which Tribe should give the ^us^t.) but their meaning is, as Pet. Martyr: and
Fr. Iunius.
two worthy Interpreters rightly observe, by Lot to design who of each Tribe
should be warriors, and who should be purueyors, who should go forth to
fight, and who should be employed to bring in provisions (...) those that abode
abroad in the field. Judge. 17.6 and 18.1 and 19.1. and 21.25.
The State there was then popular, as Martyr in Igud. c. 20.
one of them well notes: and therefore it seemed best to decide that by Lot,
which without much tumult in an Anarchy could not easily have been determined
otherwise.

The latter Example is in a City business; where the same people returned from
the Babylonian deportation, Nehem. 10 34.
cast among themselves Lots by Ezra's direction, thereby to design, who should
undergo the burden for the bearing of the charge and expense, or employing
their pains in fetching and bringing in of wood, to be spent daily in Gods
service on the Altar of burnt offerings; the times being then dangerous, and the
work of some difficulty in regard of their enemies that lay in wait for them
on every side.

5. Neither was this use of Lots less frequent among other nations then among
Gods own people; (...) Aristot. polit l. 6. c. 2. (...) Ibid. (...) Ibid. l.
4. c 16. (...) de Democratia Otanes apud Herodot. l. 3. (...) Plut: ad Apo^lon

admitted and approved by such state-masters or state-wrights (if I may so term
them) that so plotted and molded states, as if they wrought them out of wax,
as they deemed would be for the best, and like longest to continue.

6. But to leave his frame to those that list to make trial of it; in this
particular many famous Estates have much concurred with him. For first among
the Greeks, and more specially at Athens; to let Sparta pass, where I find

then took place, drew by Lot again (...) Lib^^. ^^g. Aud^ and V^^i in Median

drawn out (...)
a Commander or a Prouest, whose government in that kind lasted but one day of

day at once, because the keys of the Castle at Athens were in his keeping: and
so seven of them having it in course as the white bean favored them, three of
them of necessity were debarned of it.

by Lot were the Vestall Virgins there in succeeding ages designed, as the
place became void by decease or default, one taken of twenty picked out
formerly by the chief Priest. And for Civil Offices among the Romans (who

divided by Lot.

For first after the making away of Romulus, (...) etc. Dionys. Hal. l. 2
the two hundred of the Gentry, divided into tens, cast Lots for the ruling of
the State in course among themselves, each ten their fifty days, and each of
the ten his five; and so the next ten after, till they had all taken their
turns. But that course they soon grew weary of, and at Numaes election it
expired.

Again after the ejection of the Tarquines and the surcease of regal state,
the two Consuls or Majors by Brutus his means then settled, where some
extraordinary business fell out, that was to be done by them, and could not
conveniently be done but by one, (as Val. Horatiusque Coss. sortiti vter Ionis

both being to go abroad for the waging of war in several places, or the

which through the evil success of it lasted not long: by Lot Dion. Cass.

the multitude of suites, that intermission of Justice had now cloied them
withal.

in Italy even at this day; and that in some of those Estates that for
wisdom and policy are of special note and general renown. Among other the
State of Venice which many make the very Mirhor of policy, and some suppose to
be Venetorum r^mpub esse vindicias caelestis reipublica. Platonis Darts in

^ontaren. de Venet. repub l. 1. and Postel de Magistr. Athen. c. 2.
whereas among them the whole body of their Gentry are of course admitted into
their General Council at 25. years of age, and not ordinarily earlier; yet
at 20. they may make suite for it, and if the Lot favor them, then obtain it.
To this purpose they meet once a year Decembris 4. Contar. 14. Postel.
the fourth of December: at which time those that seek it, having formerly
made proof of their Gentry, have their names cast all into one pot, and
brought in to the Duke, before whom stands another pot with as many balls in
it, whereof a fifth part is gilt, and the rest all silver only. He draws each
man's name out of the one, and withal a ball out of the other, which if it
prove a golden one, he is thereupon admitted, if a silver one only, he staieth
at least a year longer. Again in the choice of their Officers, not so much
the maine Offices, as the Electorships are in part disposed by Lot, somewhat
after the manner that Supra. 7. ex Dion. l. 54.
Augustus sometime used, as not long before we showed. For first in the
designation of their Duke their principal Magistrate there is Lotery upon
Lotery, lotting and voicing in a prolix and intricate manner enterchangeably
mixed the one with the other. Contaren. de repub. Venet. l. 2.
When the place is void either by deposition, or (as most usually) by decesse,
all their Gentry of 30. years of age or upward (for none under are then
admitted) are assembled together, and come in order of place as they sit (Lots
first cast which side of them shall come first) to the Lotpot, having as many
balls in it as there be of them in all, whereof 30. only are gilt: there a
child draws for each of them, till for 30. of them those 30. gilt ones be
drawn. For which 30. the child draws again the second time out of another
pot that has 9. only gilt ones. The nine so drawn withdraw themselves into a
conclaue, where among themselves they name 40. such as have each of them 6.
voices at least. Out of the 40. so named are 12. again selected by Lot: which
12. among themselves choose 25. each at least by 8. voices. Of these 25. are 9.
again by Lot set apart: which 9. nominate further 45. as before: and those 45.
being by Lot again reduced to eleven; these eleven choose out 41. of the chief
Senators, which last have power to elect a Duke. These 41. then after an oath
by them severally taken to choose whom they judge worthiest, and some other
solemnities performed, write each of them in a scroll whom he thinks good.
The scrols are mingled together, and then drawn as they come: and the fitness
of the person first drawn is discussed: who if he have 25. voices with him,
had wont aunciently to carry it without further ado. But of latter-times they
go on, and he that has most voices above that number, come he first or last to
hand, has the place. If none of them have voices enough, they begin again,
and continue till some one be nominated that has.

Contar. de Venet. repub. l. 1. Et Postel. de Magistr. Athen. c. 8.
Again in their yearly assemblies for the choice of other Officers, all their
Gentry that have voice in Council (none of them excluded) draw first for 60.
gilt balls out of two pots by one Lotery, the one half out of the one, and the
other half out of the other: and then those 60. for 36. other gilt ones out of
an other pot by a second Lotery. And the 36. that have thus drawn and lighted
on gilden balls twice, have power to nominate to such Offices as are then to be
chosen: which they do in this manner. They go apart into certain conclaues by
nine and nine in four companies. Where all those of each company in order of
years draw out of a Lot-pot balls with marks upon them for the several
Offices; and according to the ball that each of them has drawn, he nominateth
what Citizen he will for that Office, who if he have 6. voices of those 9. the
party yet holds; if not, an other must be nominated by him, till some one be
so approved. By this means among those four Companies are there four
Competitors nominated for each of their Offices, whereof one is chosen by most
voices of the whole Assembly, the Electors and the whole kindred of the parties
nominated being only first excluded.

Somewhat after the same manner are they reported to choose, not their Electors,
but their Offices in the Tuscan Estate. For Estates and Empires transl^ted out
of French by Grimston.
dividing those that are capable of Office into three ranks, and accordingly
casting them into three boxes: Out of the first they draw the Magistrates of
highest place; the middle sort out of the second; and the lowest out of the
third, And having thus drawn five several ones for each Office, he carries
it, that has of the five the most voices in the Council: But their election
stands as it pleases the Duke to confirm it, and no further.

9. Generally in all places among all sorts of people imploiments of all sorts
have thus often been shared. In war much was thus managed. For in garrisons,
seiges, pight fields and set camps, those that served together, had their
times, and places, and courses often assigned them by Lot, as for Milites sortito

by Lot it was determined (if a Poets word may go for good) whether of the
twain should give the onset. In jeopardous exploites, or where multitude might
cause confusion, and hinder rather then help, a Lot was called in, to order
and marshall the matter. Thus Huc delecta virum sortiti corpora furtim

by Lot it is said to have been decided who should be enclosed in the wodden
Horses womb at the taking of Troy. Thus Plutarch in Timoleon.
Timoleon being to pass a river with his army in the face of the enemy,
took the rings of the several Leaders by drawing them to decide in what order
they should pass; and when the ring of one of them that had a Trophey engraven
on it, came first to hand, they left all further lotting, and with great
alacrity made each of them with all speed they could over, and so discomfited
those forces, that stood on the other side to inhibite their passage. And thus
Plut. in Pericle.
Pericles, when he could hardly restrain his people inconsiderately ouer-eager
on sight, he divided them into two parts, and by Lot assigned them, some to
skirmish, and some to rest and make merry the whilst, to wit, that part of
them (...).

Grammarians have thought (though (...) literis transpositis, versoque (...) in
(...). Auenar. Guichard. and Crucig.

name, because by it men were usually called unto this or that work. But sure
it is that in this regard in speech ordinary, though figurative, men are
commonly said to have this or that Office Act. 1.7. (...). de Judah. and 17.4.
(...), d^ ^i^ qui s^ ^i sponte associauerant.
allotted them, though it come not by Lot to them, but by election or
otherwise: as our Savior is said truly to have been anointed Heb. 1.9.

a Priest, and Luke
a Prophet, though neither any Prophets ever used to be anointed, nor any such
material oil ever came on his head. The not observing whereof has made Sic
Bodin. de Mario ad bell. Mithrid. a Sulpit. Trib. Pl nom^n d^monol. l. 1. c. 6.
Vise etc. 10.. 3.
some suppose Lotterie there, where indeed there is no lot at all.

. 10. Thus have we seen how frequent the use of Lots has been among all
sorts, for distribution of Offices and Services Civil and Sacred: Now they
were no less frequent also in the division of Inheritances, of Lands and
possessions, of Goods and Chattels, and the like: yea and often times of Rewards
too, as well pains and penalties, as Honors and Dignities.

Of Lands and possessions by Lot assigned to be held and inhabited we have
sundry examples in Scripture.

For first at the first entrance of Gods people upon the Land of promise, the
whole Land in general was divided by Lot, and that by Number 26 55. and 33.54 and
36.2.
Gods own appointment, among the 12. Tribes. Concerning which partition there
is some scruple among the learned arising from the words of Gods Edict
concerning it thus recorded by Moses: Number. 26.53. ad 57.
Unto these (that is, the 12. Tribes, though Number. 18.20. and 26.62.

Deuteronomy 10.9. and 18.2.

I^sh 13.14.33.


Leui be left out, because Number. 26.29.35 Josh. 14.4.
Joseph in Manasses and Ephraim makes twain) shall the Land be divided to
inherit according to the number of their names, (that is, of their persons, as
the word, Act. 1.15. and Apoc. 3.4. Numerus nominu^ Et, habes pau^a no^ina.
Name, is also elsewhere used.) To many shall thou give a large inheritance,
and to fewer a less: to each one shall inheritance be given according to his
number. Notwithstanding the Land shall be divided by Lot: according to the
names of the Tribes of their Fathers shall they inherit. According to the Lot
shall the Possession of it be divided between many and few. Where the Question
is how the greater number should have a larger portion, and the fewer a less,
when each part was to have its portion assigned it by Lot.

For the solution hereof Ordinatio^e di^^na sort cade^te super terra^
proportionata^ pro plu^alitate vel paucitate hominum. Lyr^ in Number. c. 26. and
^^r^. i^ Ion. c. 1.
some say, that it was so to fall out, by Gods special providence miraculously
directing the Lots, that the greater compass of ground should fall to the
greater number of men, and the less to the fewer. But that is not likely: for
had it been so meant, God would rather have said; To many I will give a larger
portion, and to fewer a less. Divide thou as equally and exactly as thou art
able to do by Lo^: and I will cause it to fall out so, that the more men shall
have more Land, and fewer men less: or, Do thou divide it into unequal
parts; and I will make it fall equally to fit every Tribes turn. So that the
casting of the Lots should be Ioshuas work only; but the fitting of more and
fewer with larger or scanter possessions and portions Gods own immediate
disposition. Yea the event it self controlleth this idle conceit. For we
find that Josh. 17.14.
some of them were scanted in those portions that by Lot befell them, whereof
also they complained: and Josh. 19 9.
others again had more besell them, then they were able well to people; and
therefore are willing to admit others with them as Inmates.

Others think Ex Hebr^^rum quorundam sei^entia, quam R. Leui i^ comment. ad
Josh. approbat, ad Number. reijcit; Masius ad I^sh. c. 15.
that the twelve men assigned to that Office of dividing the Land by Lot, had a
power by virtue of that Edict conferred upon them, after the Lotery performed
according to the partition made by others employed thereunto by them, to
enlarge or straighten the bounds of each several portion, as they should see
good; by virtue of which power they were to fit each part to the number of the
people that were of that Tribe, which the same by Lot was fallen unto. This
indeed has more show of probability then the former; and Josh. 1^.1.9.
we find some alteration and change in this kind after the several
possessions were determined by Lot.

But yet that seems to be soundest that some In familijs subdiuisa ^st per
sor^es inaequales pro numero personarum. Ex aliorum sententia. Lyra in Number. c.
26. Et ex Josh. 15.1. Oleast. Et Trem. ac Iun. ibid.
others have conceived, that in that Edict there is mention of a twofold
partition, and either of them, necessarily required. The former a Number. ^6.55.56.
general division of the whole Land (taking in that on this side Jordan, Number.
32.33. and 34.13.14.15. I^sh. 14.1.2.3.
held by the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the Tribe of Manasses) into 12.
Shires or Cantons equally divided, to be distributed by Lot: the latter N^m.
26.53.54
a particular Subdiuision of each Canton or Shire unequally parted among those
of that Tribe whom the same by Lot had befalne, as their Families or kindreds
were more populous or more penurious of people.

Now as God enjoined, so (...). Act. 13.19.
Joshua accordingly did: For I^sh. 14.1.2.
he divided the whole Land among them by Lot. Josh. 11.23.
He began the work so soon as the Land was at any rest, and Josh. 14.1. and
19.51.
afterward went on with it till he had made an end of it; assisted therein
according to Number. 34.17.18.
Gods own appointment by Eleazar the High-preist and the 12. Heads of the
twelve Tribes. Their several Lots in what course they came the holy Ghost has
left upon record. For at the first Session or solemn meeting for the
performance of that business, Josh. 15.
the first Lot fell to Judas, and Josh. 16.1.4.
the second to Joseph in Josh. 16.5. ad finem.
Ephraim and Josh. 17.1. ad 12
Manasses. Josh. 18.2.10.
At the second Assembly had the other seven Tribes, to wit, Josh. 18.11. ad
finem.
Benjamin, Josh. 19.1. ad 10.
Simeon, Josh. 19.10. ad 17.
Zabulon, Josh. 19.17. ad 24.
Isac^ar, Josh. 19.24. ad 32.
Asher, Josh. 19.32. ad 40.
Nephthalim, and Josh. 19.40. ad 49.
Dan, (for thus by course their Lots came out) their portions allotted them;
Josh. 18.4. ad 10
the rest of the Land, not before assigned, being divided into seven parts, not
Joseph. antique l. 5. c. 3.
by ten men, as Josephus, but Masius ad Josh. c. 18.
by 36. rather, or 21. at the least, (three a piece out of each Tribe, Lauat.
Josh. c. 18.
either of the whole Twelve, or Calvin. Josh. c. 18.
of those seven whose turns then were to be served) employed specially to that
purpose.

Concerning the manner of Lotery used in that action there is some diversity of
opinion. Rabbini in Baba Bathra test Masio: and Schindl. lex. Pent.
Some think that the Lots of the Land were put into one pot, and the Tribes
names into another, and that one choice person, to wit Eleazar, drew for all.
Joseph. antique l. 5. c. 3.
Others imagine that there was only one pot of Tickets containing the names of
the portions, out of which one of each Tribe drew for the Tribe he was of.

Masius in Josh. c. 15.
Others lastly suppose that the Tribes names only were put into the Lot-pot,
and that each Tribe, as it was drawn, had his choice of which part he would
yet undisposed when he drew. The first opinion seems most probable, both
because once drawing so might well end all, Neque ^nim certum satis quod Mas.
ad Josh c. 15. tribuum praerogatiuam in prius posteriusque sortiendo seruatam.
Et manifesto falsum qu^d Oleast. ad Number. c. 33. ordinem nascend^ in sortiendo
secutos.
which would not be in the second, where question might be who should draw
first, which would ask a new Lotery; and again because it is not said in the
story, that such a Tribe drew or was drawn first or second simply, but that
I^sh. 19.1. and 21.4.
the Lot came out first or second for such a Tribe, which agrees not with the
third.

There was indeed Chytrae. i^ Iud. c. 1.
a special hand of God in this Lotery, (as there is often in others) as it was
done by special appointment from him; in regard whereof it may seem to some
worthy to be ranked rather among extraordinary Lots; considering especially
how fitly the event of it sorted with C^n^s. 49.
Jacobs prophetical prediction in his last will and Testament. But yet I take
this rather to be the proper place of it: because howsoever there were a
special providence of God in it, thereby to fulfill that holy Patriarchs
prophecy, yet the maine matter that it was applied unto and that was aimed at
in it by those that were agents therein, is like to have been no other then Ad
contentiones excludendas. Ly^. in Number. c. 26.
an ordinary partition of such possessions as by conquest and Gods gift were
cast upon them, without expectation of any special direction of them, and the
Tribes they were drawn for, to such certain parts and seats.

Now as the whole Land in general was thus divided by Lot, so in particular
were the Cities assigned to the Levites divided among them by Lot likewise
according to their Families. For whereas Number. 35.7.8. Josh. 21.2.
God had commanded that 48. Cities in all should be assigned them, more from
those that had more, and fewer from those that had less; again, whereas Number.
26.57. and 3.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 27, 33.
the Levites were divided into three Families according to Leuies three sons,
Kehath, Gershon, and Merari; and I^sh. 21.10, 20.
the Kehathites were subdivided again into two ranks, to wit, the Aaronites
or the issue of Aaron, Kehaths nephew by his son Amram, which alone had the
Priesthood, and the rest of that house which came not of Aaron; there were
I^sh. 21.8.
Lots cast by them for these their several Families in what Tribes there
should Cities be assigned unto each. So that the Princes set down how many
Cities each Tribe should afford according to the quantity of their
possessions and the number of their Cities; as also which Cities in each Tribe
should be given them as most convenient for their abode, who were to be
dispersed into all parts of Gods people. Which being first by them determined,
I^sh 21.4. ad 43. 1 Chronicles. 6.54. ad finem.
the four Families drew Lots then, which of them should have the Cities set
apart in each Tribe; and so Josh 21.4.
the Aaronites had 13. in Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin; Josh. 21.5.
the other Kehathites 10. in Ephraim, Dan, and the one half of Manasses; Josh.
21.6.
the Gershonites 13. in Issachar, Asher, Nephthali, and the other half of
Manasses; and Josh. 21.7.
the Merarites 12. in Reuben, Gad, and Zebulon^ the whole 48. in all.

And as at their first coming into the Land of promise, the possession of it
was in this manner divided by Lot; so at their return again unto it from the
Chaldean Captivity, was Nehem. 11.1.
a Colonie by Lot drawn for the peopling of Jerusalem, one taken of each ten,
and so a tenth of the whole company for the storing of the City, beside such
as voluntarily offered themselves thereunto, the remnant being left to replenish
other places, and to possess the residue of the Country round about. Yea the
whole City it self (if we might believe Joseph. Gorionid. (...)
the counterfeit Ben-Gorion, or at least his abridger, for the true Josephus
says Joseph. Flau. capt. l. 5. c. 1. vi inua isse.
otherwise) was by Lot shared in three parts by the three seditious Commanders
in the time of the Roman seige.

11. Now moreover Lots were used for Partition, as of Lands, so of Mooueables,
of Goods and Chatels, and the like.

As namely first in some cases for the setting out of Tith. Leu. 27.32.
Every tenth one, says God, of the Ballockes, or neat, and of thy flocks, or
lesser cattle, goats and sheep, as they pass under the rod, shall be holy to
the Lord: there shall no regard be had of good or bad, nor any exchange be made
of it. For whereas the very tenth indeed, or that which fell in the tenth place
precisely was in strict right the Priests due, but which that should be could
not easily be known where great herds of neat or flocks of sheep were, this
seemed the equallest course, and is enjoined therefore by God, that Vt quo
ordine ex stabulis sua sponte exeunt, decimum quodque baculo numerantis
tangatur, and segregelur Domino. Iun. ad Leu. c. 27. and R. Sal. Iareb. ibid.
every tenth one of them should be touched and taken, as they came out of the
stall or the fold, by the Tithing-mans rod, and so set apart for the Priest.
That which God alludeth unto where he tells his people by the Prophet, that
Ezech. 20.37.
he would cause them to pass under the rod, and bring them into the Bond of
his Covenant: that is, La^at. in E^ech.
by a Metaphore taken from Sheepheards that count their sheep with a rod or a
sheep-hookes Iun. in Ez c, 20.
he would search his people, and sort them, as the Sheepherd does his sheep,
to take the better sort of them, Verse. 38.
rejecting and excluding the rest, into his fold, to be in league with him and
under his charge.

Again in division of Booties, of prey and spoils taken in war. So are
Obad. verse. 11.
Lots said to have been cast upon Jerusalem when it was sacked by the Chaldees,
and Joel. 3.3.
her people by Lot shared among the Conquerors for Slaves: As also Nahum 3.10.
the Nobles were of Nineueb in the sacking of that City, whether by the
Medians, or by the Vise Herodo^. hist. l. 1.
Scythians, by whom it was at several times surprised.

And of Goods otherwise gotten, as by pillage or stealth. As where David
complained of his enemies that Psalm. 2^.19.
they had parted his garments among them, and cast Lots upon his vesture. Which
thing is by Calvin. in harmon. Gualt. in Joan. c. 19.
good writers justly supposed to have been first practiced upon David, 1 Samuel
19.11.12 (...): vt Plutar. (...).
what time constrained to fly for fear of his life, his house was rifled by
his foes, and his goods to his very garments sea^ed on, and by Lot, it is
likely, shared among them: but was questionless, (the Matthew. 27.35. Mark
15.24. Luke 23.34. Joan. 19 24.
holy Ghost testifies it) fulfilled in our Savior, when the Soldiers that
executed him, parted his garments among them, and Ne inutilis redderetur.Aug.
in Joan. tr. 218. and Suarez in 3 ^om. 2. disp. 38. 1.
to save it from quartering, cast Lots apart upon one of them, to wit, the
Coat without seame (the rather, Resoluta in parts, parts etiam in particulas

much away if they be rent,) but the rest of them, or the other two (for

But to leave these uncertainties, such a Lot as this Prou. 1.14.
Solomon alludeth unto, where he brings in theeuish Companions not so much

inuiting him whom they would persuade to adventure his part with them, (for

promising him, that he shall cast Lot with them, that is, shall have an equal
share with them in whatsoever they get: A legitima negotiatorum societate
sumptalocutio. Iun.
as those are wont to do and to have that deal by way of lawful traffic
together in joint stock.

To this Head may we further refer the designing or picking out of persons by
Lot to be saved or to be slain. So Chald. paraphr.
some expound that of 2. Sam. 8.2.
David's measuring out the Moabites with two coards to be destroyed, and with
one full coard to be saved alive: though Lyra, Iun. alij.
the most turn it another way. Yea so Non cecidit super eam sors, vt alij
perirent, alij saluarentur; sed cunctis communis ven^t intericus. Hier. in
Ezech. quem sequuntur L^uat. Lyra, and Geneu. nota.
most Interpreters understand Gods speech, where he bids the Prophet Ezech.
24 6.
pull the flesh piece by piece, every piece of it out of the pot or caldron,
and cast no Lot on it: thereby signifying that the people should not be some
destroyed and some saved, but should all utterly be destroyed without
distinction or difference; though Vise Iunij not.
some of late understand this also otherwise. But of this use evidently was
Louit. 16.1, 9, 10.
the Lot that was cast on the two Goats, (for it was merely diuisory, not
diuinatory to tell whether was fitter for the service, both being alike fit for
it) whereby the one was taken for the Scapegoat to be saved and sent out
alive, the other left to be slain and to make a Sinne-sacrifice to God in the
behalf of his people. And these be all Examples that I find of this Use of
Lots in holy writ.

12. Among profane Writers there is nothing almost rifer then the use of Lots
in this kind. (...). Dion. Chrysostom. orat. 64.
Inheritances among Coheires were by Lot often divided. For so; to pass by the

King. 3.26.
the wrong Mother in Scripture) they suffer things often to be spoiled rather
then an other should have good of them. The like is willed to be done where the
choice of some Chatell is bequeathed to diverse; or that one that it was
bequeathed to dying leaves diverse Executors; if they cannot otherwise agree.

And our Common Law likewise, among other courses of partition of Land between

and some to be saved.

CHAP. V. Of the Lawfulness of such Lots: with Cautions to be observed in the
use of them.
1. NOw that Lots of this kind are lawful being used with due Caution, most
Divines acknowledge, howsoever the arguments that some of them bring, are not
so sound many of them as were to be wished; and their Cautions the most of them
are either unsound or superfluous, as upon the view and surveigh of some of
them shall appear.

In the arguments alleged for them, the general error of most Authors is
(that which has also caused much mistaking otherwise) that they confound
Ordinary and Extraordinary Lots the one with the other, and so reason without
reason from the one to the other: As if a man should reason from Judge. 3.21.

Let the Arguments of Aret. in Problem. part. 1. loc. 67.
one that has heaped up most serve for the rest, to show how confusedly men
have formerly dealt in this argument.

First, therefore says he, Gubernantur a Des ad bonu^ finem. Aret. ibid.. 4.
Lots are guided and governed Prou. 16 33.
by God to a good end.

True: but 2. Cor. 12.7. Act. 15.38, 39, 40, 41.
so are men's sins too guided to good ends by God 2. Cor. 4.6. Psalm. 112.4.

turning evil to good, and Implet Deus v^luntates suas vtique bonas per
malorum hominum voluntates malas. Augenehir. c. 101.
using man's evil will to the working and effecting of his own holy will. For
Vitiorum nosfirorum non est author Deus, sed ordinator est. Quaedam ergo and
facit and ordinat; quaedam ver o tantum ordinat: Iustos and fatit and ordinat;
peccatores autem, in quantum peccatores sunt, non facit, sed ordinat tantum.
Aug. de Genesis ad lit. l. 5.
he disposes and orders all things, even the wickedest and the worst things,
Non fit praeur Dei voluntatem etiam quod contra ciusdem fit voluntatem; quia
non fi ret, sinon sineret: nec vtique nolens sinit, sed volens: nec siner^t
sum bonus fieri malum, nisi posset de malo facere bonum. Aug. enchir. c. 100.
who being infinitely good, would not suffer any evil, but that he knows how
to do good even with evil.

Secondly, Ortum a Deo habent. Aret. ibid. Deo autore vsi sunt. Ibid.
Lots have their original from God, who commanded Le^it. 16. 8, 9, 10.
Lots to be cast upon the two goats; and Number. 26.55, 56.

Thirdly, Approbante Deo missae. Aret. ibid.
God approved the Lots practiced by Josh 7 16.17.18
Joshua and 1 Samuel 10.20.21
Samuel; for the discovery of Achan, and the election of Saul.

True it is; God approves whatsoever he commands. But Gods approbation of
what he commands, gives no warrant for what he does not likewise command.
That which this Author himself also well saw where he says, that Aret. ibid.
6.
The examples of the Saints are not easily to be imitated. And again, that
Ibid. ca^t. 3.
what Joshua did, he did enjoined it by God, which no man may therefore take
pattern to do the like by, unless he have the like commandment from God so
to do. And what he says of Joshua, may be said also of Samuel.

Fourthly, In alijs casibus pij his landabiliter f^nt vsi Aret. ibid. 4. rat. 4.
In other cases have godly men likewise laudably used Lots. Asin Luke 1.9.
the ministry of Zachary; in Act. 1.26.
the choice of Matthias; in 1 Samuel 14.41.42.
the discovery of Jonathan: nor are the Lots disallowed that Ion. 1.7.
the Seam^n cast upon Jonas.

These examples some of them, as that of Matthias his and the former, were
extraordinary actions, done by special warrant: others of them, as those of
Saul and the Seamen upon Jonas and Jonathan though not expressly condemned, yet
are not allowed, neither can well be justified; and others lastly of them, as
that of Zachary, are of the point in question, and must by some other ground
be proved warrantable.

Fifthly, Faciunt ad Dei gloriam; dum Domino deferunt iudicium, etc. Aret. ibid.
rat. 5.
They make for Gods glory; recourse being had in them to Gods judgment.

So R^m 3.7.
aly may make for Gods glory; and yet Job 13 4.7. 1. Cor. 15.14.15.
is not therefore allowable. Yea the very offering to have recourse to Gods
immediate judgment without special warrant is unwarrantable.

Sixthly, Controuersiae litesqu^ inexplicabiles ei^ fi^iuntur. Aret. ibid. rat.
6. (...) Schol Apollon. Argon. 2.
They end great strifes and inexplicable suites.

The Use of them then is profitable and commendable, if allowable and
warrantable: But that is the point to be proved. Otherwise Romans 38.
Evil may not be done that good may come of it. Yea Vise Aug. de mendac c. 10.
the least moral evil that is may not be admitted for the preventing or
avoiding of the greatest natural evil, or for the archeiuing of the greatest
politic good.

2. And of this nature are the arguments that are usually brought for the
confirmation of the truth in this point. Which in regard therefore of the
inualidity and insufficiency of them leaving to their several Authors to make
good as they may, we will assay to give some sounder grounds: And for the
present we will press only the testimony of Solomon, where speaking of such
kind of Lots as these are, he says, that Prou. 18.1^.
The Lot staieth or ^^inteth contentions or suites, and makes partition among
the mighty. In which words the holy Ghost manifestly not allows only and
approves the use of Lots in such cases, but commends it unto us as a wife
and discreet course for the taking away of controversies and questions in this
kind, and the preventing of law-suites or other quarrels that thence otherwise
might arise. The place is pregnant, and the proof express, considering whom
it is spoken by. Neither shall I need to spend many words for the present
either for the further urging and enforcing of it, or the seconding of it with
other arguments: partly because most Divines generally concur in the
approbation of them, though their proofs be most of them impertinent; and one
evident argument may well suffice in a matter not much controuersed; and partly
also because the point will receive further strength from the arguments that
shall Chap. 6.. 4. etc. to the end.
hereafter be produced for the next sort of Lots, which are more questionable
then these. Whither referring the Reader for fuller satisfaction, we will
proceed in the next place to consider of the Cautions necessarily to be
observed in the use of such Lots.

3. When therefore it is said that such Lots are lawful, it is not so to be
conceived, as if the meaning were to justify every particular instance in that
kind that either was formerly produced or ever has bin practiced; In omnibus
re^us videndum est qua^enus. Suus enim cuique modus est. Cic in oratore.
particular circumstances many times alter the nature of actions, and make
those things often unlawful, that otherwise are not evil; but to approve only
the use of them in those cases, where by such circumstances it is not corrupted
and changed. In regard whereof it is not without just cause, that those that
deal in this argument, and allow the use of such Lots, are wont to annex
certain Cautions or rules to direct and limite the use of them: yet herein
failing not a little, in that, as their proofs the most of them are
insufficient or impertinent; so their Cautions are many of them either unsound
or superfluous, to wit, such as sort not either with the nature of these Lots,
or with the ordinary use of them. We will first briefly consider of them, and
then set down some other, more apt at least, in the room of them.

The first Caution then given usually is that Peccatur, si absque necessitate
ad sorts recurra^ur. Them sum p^r. 2a 2 a.q 95. a. 8. and de sort. c. 5. Nider
ad praecept. 1. c. 10. Mar^yr. in 1. Sam. c. 10. Aret. probl. par. 1. loc. 67.

205. Et Liu. hist. ^. 9. Iustu^ est bellum, q^ibus necessariu^; and pia arma,
quibus nulla nisi in armis reliuquit^r spes.
Arms, only in case of necessetie, when they have tried all other courses, and
where all other fail, when nothing else will serve to effect what we would
have: Thom. vbi supra. and Ale^. Alos sum. par. 2. q 185. me^. 3.
Otherwise to use Lots were a tempting of God.

But it is not necessary to require any such necessity, since the thing that
is thus put to Lot ought to be a matter of mere indifferency, as hereafter
shall appear; and the course it self also is no other. Which therefore even
where diverse ways or courses may be to end a controversy by, may choice be
made of among the rest, being as fit and equal as any of the rest. The suites
mentioned by Solomon in Prou. 18.18.
the place before alleged as determinable by Lot, are such as may by other
courses also, (as by arbitrament and compromise, or by condescension Gen 13.89.
the one yielding the choice to the other,) be composed: and therefore it is
not necessity simply, that either enforces or warranteth the use of a Lot in
them. Neither is there in such case any tempting of God, where there is, as no
need, so no expectance of any extraordinary work of God. Yea on the other
side where the same is either required or expected, there God is tempted, be
the necessity enforcing the Lot never so great.

The second Caution is that Peccatur, si quis absque Dei reuerenti^ sortibus
vtatur. Thom. 2^ 2 ae q. 95. a. 8. and de sort. c. 5. Martyr. ad 1. Sam. c. 10.
Nider ad praec. 1. c. 10. B^din. daemonol. l. 1. c. 6
They be reverently and religiously undertaken, Fus^s ad Deum precibus. Bed^
in Act. 1. Et Orig. in Josh. hom. 23.
with solemn prayer unto God formerly conceived, as Act. 1.24, 25, 26.
was sometime done in the choice of Matthias.

It is true indeed that 1 Cor. 10.31. Coloss. 3.17.
nothing ought to be done irreligiously or irreuerently. But yet there is great
difference in the religious and reverent usage of things, to be meated out and
limited by the weight of the work. In regard whereof there may be no want of
due reverence in some actions, wherein yet such solemnities are not observed.

Again it is no less true, that we are to Luke 18.1. 1 Thessalonians. 5.17.
pray continually: and that 1. Tim. 48. (...). Marc. leg. spir.
all our actions (even the least and lightest of them, even our sports and
pastimes, much more all our serious, though civil, affairs) are to be
sanctified by prayer: But how? or in what manner? Not that a man is bound at
each several act, as upon every bargain he makes, or every peni-worth of
ware that he sells, to fall down on his knees and conceive a set prayer; no
more then to say a new grace for each several course that is brought to the
board, or each several dish that is carved at the board, or upon every other bit
of meat that he puts into his mouth. The prayer conceived at the beginning
of the meal serves sufficiently for all: and the Psalm. 55.17. and 141.2.
Morning sacrifice sanctifies the whole ordinary days work, though
eiaculations, as they term them, may be seasonably used, as occasion shall
require. So here usually is no other sanctification required then is common to
other civil affairs: Not but that In sacris literis ideo preces praemissae,
quia de rebus grauioribus sorts adhibita. Serar. in Josh. c. 7. q. 21.
prayer specially applied to the Lot may in some case be conceived, where the
matter is more weighty, and the event of some consequence, as (...). Plato de
leg. l. 6.
in the choice of a Magistrate, or (...).- Hom. (...) Vnde Ajax apud Ovid.
Metam l. 13. - sortemque meam vouistis Achiui, E^ vestrae valuere preces.- Et
Liu. l. 10. Sortientibus prouincias Coss. Hetruria Caruilio euenit secundum
vota milit^m.
of a Combatant, in division of Land where some special cause is to affect one
part before another, and the like: Otherwise In rebus leuicul^s non est
necessaria oration. Serar. in Josh. c. 7. q. 21.
solemn prayer is no more necessary unto the use of a Lot, then it is to any
other ordinary business whatsoever. The instance given is of a sacred
extraordinary Lot. And it is no sound course to reason from extraordinary to
ordinary, from sacred to civil, from some particular to the general.

A third Caution is that Vt absit superstitio and curiositas. Martyr. ad 1.
Sam. cap. 10. and Aret. probl. par. loc. 67.. 6. caut. 2.
No superstition or curiosity be mixed with it: but Euentus a Deobo^isue
Angelis expectetur, etc. Thom. 2^ 2 ae q. 95. a. 8. and de sort. c. 4. Nider.
inpraecept. 1. c. 10.
the event be religiously expected from God.

Superstition indeed altreth the nature of a Lot, and makes it not a mere
Diuisory but a Diuinatorie Lot: for the paring whereof away therefore some
Caution may seem needful: as we shall afterward see.

For the latter Clause: to expect the issue and event of it, as by ordinary
means from God, is common to all actions: to expect it by an immediate and
extraordinary work is no more lawful here then elsewhere, yea is indeed
mere superstition, as hereafter we shall show.

The fourth and fifth Cautions are that Ne in illicita inquiramus, etc. Aret.
ibid. caut. 3.
We inquire not into things unlawful by Lot: as what is become Josh. 7.16, 17,
18.
of goods stolen or lost; or Ne in futura. Aret. ibid.
to foretell what shall be: for that is to turn Lotery into Sorcery.

But such Lots as these are merely Diuinatorie, (no Diuisory Lots) of which
severally by themselves.

A sixth Caution, that Ne diuina oracula ad terrena negotia conuertantur. ex
Aug. epist. 119. c 20. Thom. p. 2a 2 ae q. 95. a. 8. Nider. ad praecept. 1. c.
10. Martyr. ad 1. Sam. c. 10.
We use no texts of Scripture in our Loteries.

It is true indeed generally of all actions, that holy things are not to be
applied to profane uses. But the abuse here touched is in diuinatorie Lots,
simply unlawful, whether such sacred things be used in them or no.

A seventh Caution is, that Ne in electionibus ^ Ecclesiasticis, etc. Thom.
sum. par. 2a 2 ae q. 95. a. 8. and de sort. c. 5. Nider. ad praecept. 1 c. 10.
Panorm. ad Decretal. l. 5. de Sortileg. tit. 21. cap. 3. vbi Honorius 3. Quod
Pontificem ex vobis vnu^ elegistis per sortem, nota non caret: quinimo multa
reprehensione dignu^ est, quod sors in talibus interuenit. Et post, Sortis vsum
in electionibus perpetua prohibitione damnamus.
They be not used in Ecclesiastical elections: for in temporal dignities or
offices they may.

And why not in those as well as in these, where the people or persons that
have power to choose are divided in their choice, and the Competitors generally
held equally fit for the place? that which In pastorum Ecclesiae vocationibus
vti licet. Dan. de lud. al^ae. ca. 9. Qua in re Script^ris saecris repugnet,
non liquet. Lauat. in Prou. c. 16.

diverse Popish ones too, save for the Popes prohibition.

The eighth and last Caution is that Vt fraus and dolus malus absit. Martyr. in
Sam. c. 10. Aret. problem. part. 1. loc. 67.. 6. ca^t. 5.
No couine or crafty conu^iance be used in them: like that which Ex Pausania
Aret. ibid.
Temo the Priest used in deciding a controversy between Cresphontes and
Aristodemus his issue.

For the story here touched, it is diversely reported by Authors, and in some
particulars mistaken by him that alleges it. We shall have occasion Infra cap.
12.. 6.
hereafter more particularly to relate it. Meanewhile this may suffice, that,
howsoever that which is here touched and the like guilefull courses are unjust
and consequently unlawful, especially where both parties have an interest in
that that is to be shared: For I dare not condemn Caesar's slight who in
punishing of his mutinous troops, where it was in his own power to slay or
save whom he would, (...). Dion. Cass. ^. 41.
carried the matter so cunningly, that the Lot lighted on those that had been
faultiest and forwardest in that business. Howsoever, I say, such injurious and
coosening conueiances are unwarrantable: Yet this Caution seems needless,
because the very nature of a Lot excludes all such courses: and therefore to
give such a Caution concerning a Lot, is as if a man should say that A Lot must
be a Lot, or else it cannot be a lawful Lot. For where the event is determined
by such counsels or courses, there is there no casualtie, and so consequently
no Lotery. Whereas the Question is here how a man may lawfully use a Lot, not
whether he may not use some other course in steed of a Lot, when he pretends
to use it.

4. These are most of the Cautions most commonly given; in steed whereof,
because the most of them are not so material, it shall not be amiss to
propound some other that may more precisely limite the use of this kind of
Lots, and meet with the abuses most usual in such.

Now these Cautions may be referred to two heads; they concern either the
matter wherein they are used, or the manner of using them.

Concerning the matter or businesses wherein Lots may lawfully be used the rule
of Caution in general is this that Lots are to be used in things indifferent
only. Which Caution that it may be the better conceived, a word or two will
do well for the explication of the word Indifferent used in it. The rather for
that some there be that suppose that there is no Act at all Indifferent; and so
according to their judgment, if Lots may be used in things indifferent only,
they may not be used at all. True it is that in the Schools there are two
received Axioms that may seem the one to cross the other, to wit, that Omnis
actio est adiaphora.
Every action is indifferent; and that Nulla actio est adiaphora. Vise Gerson.
in regul. mor.
No action is indifferent: which seeming contradiction they yet salve with a
distinction of Omnis nuda; nulla vestita.
naked and clothed, that every naked or bare action simply conceived is
indifferent, but no action clad with his particular circumstances is
indifferent. For example, say they, to strike is indifferent, but to strike an
Innocent, or to strike without authority, or to strike in this or that case,
this or that Person, is not so. But to come nearer home to that we have now in
hand: The word indifferent may be taken two ways, either as it opposed to Good
and Evil, and more specially to such actions of virtue and vice as deserve
more special either praise or reproof; or as it is opposed to necessary good
duties, such things as must needs be done, and so consequently also to Evils
simply forbidden, which in that regard may in no wise be done. In the former
sense is that said to be Omnia aut bona sunt, a^t mala, aut indifferentia: quod
nec bonum nec malum est, sequitur vt medium sit. Senec. epist. 118.
Indifferentia dico. quae Graeci (...) vocant, quae nec bona, nec mala sunt.
Idem ep. 83. (...) indifferens sieve medium, quod nec bonum nec malu^ est: quod
nec in bonis ponitur, nec in contrarijs. Cic. de fin. lib. 3.
indifferent, that is neither good nor bad, neither lawful nor unlawful. In
this sense albeit many Indifferentia sunt morbus, paupertas, etc. Senec. ep 83.
Indifferens est actus omnis a ratione non procedens. Thom. sum. par. 2^ 2 ae,
q. 18. a. 9. Id medium atque indifferens v^camus, quod tam malo contingere quam
bono potest. Senec. ep. 118.
natural actions not proceeding from reason, and therefore coming not within
compass of the Moral law, as for a man to talk or walk in his sleep and
the like, are in that regard merely indifferent, no Law being given of them
that may be observed or transgressed in them: As also howsoever (...), quaeper
sese ipsa neque honesta (male vulgo, inhonesta) sunt neque turpia, sed perinde
vt aguntur, ita aut probanda fiunt, aut reprehende^da. Gellius noct. Attic. l.
2. c. 7.
many actions in general are said to be indifferent, because they are not
either so simply good, but that by some particular circumstances they may be so
tainted and corrupted as they may become evil, nor yet so absolutely evil but
that in some cases and with some circumstances qualified they may not only
become good, but prove even necessary duties: Yet nevertheless most true it
is, that Vise Thom. par. 2a 2 ae, q. 14. a. 9. and q. 21. a. 1.2. Quicquid
facimus, aut malitiae, aut virt^^tis gerimu^ imperio. Senes. ep. 107.
no particular moral action, or no action of the reasonable Creature
proceeding from reason, can possibly be so indifferent, but it must of
necessity be either conformable to the rules of Gods holy word or
disconformable thereunto. In common speech indeed the word Indifferent
according to this acception is taken in some latitude of signification, when it
is attributed to such actions as though good and warrantable, yea or
necessary, yet Medium est, quod nec in virtutibus est nec in vitijs. Cic. de
fin. l. 3. Indifferens nihil gloriosum. Sen. ep. 83. Neglecta quaedam offensam
contrabunt, quae impleta gloriam non merentur; and damnant praeuaricatorem, nec
glorificant autorem. Bern. de praecept. and dispens.
are not greatly praiseworthy, because there is no special matte^ of
goodness in them, as for a man to eat when he is hungry, to drink when he
is athirst, 1. Tim. 5.8.
to provide carefully for his own Family, Matthew. 5.45.46. (...); Quid
magnifici est se amara, sibi parcere, sibi acquirere? Sen. benef. l. 4. c. 14.
Si quid amicum erga benefeci, aut consului fideliter; non videor meruisse
laudem, culpa caruisse arbitrer. Plant. trinum. act. 5. scen. 2.
to love those that love him, and the like, which yet in strictness of truth
according to this acception are not absolutely indifferent.

In the latter sense that is said to be indifferent Adiaphora collocat Gell. l.
2. c. 7. inter ea quae sua virecta and hon^sta sunt, and quae his contraria

that is good and lawful to be done, but is no necessary duty, that may
either be committed or omitted, done or left undone without sin. And thus are
many particular actions indifferent. The ground whereof is this; because the
Law of God though it bind the Creature guided by reason Praecepta negatiua
ligant semper, and ad semper.
to do nothing but what is good, and to do good at all times, yet Praecepta
affirmatiua ligant semper, sed non ad semper. Thom. par. 1a 2 ae q. 71. a. 5.
and q. 100. a. 10. and q. 88. a. 1 and par. 2a 2 ae q. 3. a. 2. and Gerson. in
regul. moral.
it binds him not to do all good at once or at all times; so that many good
things there are that may at sometime be done, whereof a man may make choice
whether of them he will do, being not necessarily tied unto or enjoined any
one of them: As for a student having diverse books about him in his study it is
indifferent to choose one this or that, refusing the rest, for present
employment, there being no special occasion to urge the use of one more then
of another: Or (...). Plut. de Stoic. contradict.
for a man that carries a pair of knives about him, it is indifferent to draw
and use either when occasion requires. And of this nature in this Caution is
the thing required to be, that is put to a Lot, to wit, such as a man may
lawfully either choose or refuse ^^ther do or leave undone.

5. Now this Caution divides it self into two distinct branches according to
the diverse quality of those things that oppose to, or swarne from this
indifferency.

The former is that Lots may not be used in ought evidently unlawful or in it
self evil, either in the omission of some necessary good duty, or in the
yielding to ought simply wicked, ungodly, or unjust, and so consequently where
at the present it is evidently apparent upon other grounds what a man ought to
choose or to refuse. For a Lot, as we have seen, is casual: and to put a
necessary act to a casual event, cannot be without sin, since it makes
that casual and contingent which Gods law makes necessary. Deuteronomy. 5.32. and
12.32 and 27.26.
In such cases therefore a man is to follow the grounds and to be led by the
rules of religion and reason; and not to put that to hazard whether he shall
do it or no, for which he sees and knows already good grounds why he
should do it or not do it. What a man sees evident grounds against, that he
may not do: and look what he may not lawfully do, that he may not put to
hazard whether he shall do or no. And on the other side what a man sees
necessary ground for, that he is necessarily bound to do: what he is
necessarily bound unto, he may not refuse or forbear to do: and wha^ ^^e may
not refuse, he may not put to the hazard of refusing.

To illustrate this by some instances. Where many stand for an office either in
Church or Commonweal, whereof some are fit, some are altogether unfit for it,
or some fitter, some less fit with very manifest difference, in this case for
those persons in whose power it is to call and admit thereunto, Peccat, qui
sortesiacit ad electionem beneficij Eccles. nullo prius habito id^neorum

to put it to Lot amongst the^ al, which of them shall have it, were utterly
unlawful: For it were to hazard the binding of themselves to do that which

though a man should cast blindfold at them, he could not miss but hit a good

contending for diverse by sundry persons on either side engaged, who may all by
that means be quieted, and some one picked out and pitched upon without

if men would be loath by Lot to take a Physician when they are sick, or a
Pilote when they are to go to sea, of whose skill they have not had some good
trial before, or assurance otherwise: much less were it fit by Lot, without
further enquiry, to commit the helm of the estate and the life of many
hundreds into the hand of any one hand-ouer-head that the Lot might light upon.
Again for private men in some danger and distress weary of their lives to
cast Lots, as Joseph. captiu. l. 3. c. 26. and l. 7. c. 35.
they sometime did, who shall slay either other, were unlawful: because a
plain breach of Gods precept: or where two Malefactors are condemned to death,
but the one is to be spared upon some special occasion, as Matthew. 27.15. Mark
15.6. Luke 23.17.
with the Jews where some offender was given them to grace their feast, (I
stand now to discuss the lawfulness of that course, but taking it to be
granted that some one is upon good ground to be spared) here Oportet vt par sit

if the parties be unlike, the one a debauched Roge that has been before often
in the like vilanies, the other but a Nouice newly fallen to the trade, and the
present his first known offense; or the one an obstinate and desperate wretch,
the other penitent and not unlikely to prove an honest man afterward; for the
public Magistrate it were unfit here to put it to hazard whether to spare or
to punish: whereas in war, as before, when a whole band has offended, Ne in
bello propter hostium metum miles deficeret, amplier ei mortis and supplicij
metus est a maioribus constitu^us: ne autem nimium multi poenam capitis
subivent, idcirco illa sortitio comparata est. Cic. ibid. Sic enim fieri posse,
vt poena ad paucus, exemplum ad multos per^eniret. Donat. in Scipion.
where the cutting off of all would be too great a maime to the whole, and
again passing by all would be a matter of evil example, here time being not
afforded to consider of particulars, who may best be spared, or who are
worthiest to be punished, all alike deserving death, and being in the power of
the General to put all to death, it is lawful for him to tithe them, as we
said they did sometime, and by Lot to decide who shall be saved, who slain.

In matter of alms and liberality, for a man to make Beggars usually as he
meets them, draw cuts for his money, were to play and make sport with his
alms and his prodigality (for that term would best fit it,) as Solitum
A^tiochum Epiphan^m, vel Epimanem potius, effusis per viam publicam nunamis

that ought to be disposed of by advice: Or again where two Persons in want
crave that relief of a man which but one of them can have, it being apparent
that the one has far more need then the other, and is nearer to the party
in whose power it is to dispose of, for him to make them draw cuts for it in
this case were not warrantable, because he may evidently see here 1. Tim. 5.8.
whether is rather to be relieved, and may not therefore hazard the defeating
of him. But for those that be in office to avoid the clamor of many much
alike poor suing for some pension, to cast Lots among them which shall have it
for the present, and which expect it hereafter; or Si cum tibi abundaret
aliquid, quod oport^ret dari ei qui non haberet, nee duobus dari posset;
occurrerent duo, quorum neuter vel indigentia, vel crga te aliqua necessitudine
superaret, nibiliustius fac^res, quam vt sort eligeres, cui da^du^ asset, quod
dari vtrique non posset. Aug. de doctrine Christ. l. 1. c. 28.
for a man that has a tool of some trade which two poor men of that trade
are Suitors to him for, there being no ground for him to pleasure the one rather
then the other, here likewise by Lot to determine whether of the twain shall
have the tool, were neither unlawful nor unfit.

6. And thus was the former branch of this Caution that Lots are not to be used
either in necessary duties or things in themselves evil, such as may
evidently at the present appear to be such.

The latter branch is that Lots may not be used in such things, though not
otherwise in themselves evil, where by consequence the use of them may in
likelihood prove Inconvenient or Inexpedient.

The reason is apparent; because 1. Cor. 6.12. and 10.23.

Est aliquid quod (...) oporteat, etia^s^ licet. Cic. pro Balb^. Quid decoat
vos, non quantum liceat vobis, spectare debetis. Idem pro Rabir.


things indifferent and such as are good and lawful in themselves, become
unlawful unto us when they grow Inconvenient or Inexpedient in the use of them.

In matters therefore of indifferency that of themselves are not evil, yet
are such as by some circumstance they may easily become evil, great regard
ought to be had of the conueniencie and expediencie of them. Where under the
head of inconueniencie I comprehend all such things, as may tend to any outward
evil: unto the head of Inexpediency I refer all such things as may bring a
man within danger of some spiritual evil.

For the former point of Conueniencie and Inconueniencie the rule is, that
because things in themselves otherwise lawful and warrantable may seem
Convenient in some respects, and Inconvenient in others, that therefore where
the Conueniences and the Inconveniences shall be laid in an even balance of
equal and indifferent judgment, either against' other the action is to be
deemed either Convenient or Inconvenient, as the one side shall appear to
weigh down the other: that is to say, The Conueniences being more or weightier
make the thing questioned Convenient, the Inconveniences being more and
weightier make it justly deemed Inconvenient.

To apply this to the present; In the Use of a Lot about a matter of it self
otherwise not evil, if the Conueniences shall be so many and so weighty on the
one side, that they may well weigh down whatsoever Inconveniences may be
produced on the other side, there the action is Convenient, and a Lot therefore
lawful: but contrariwise where the Inconveniences that shall necessarily or in
good probability appear to accompany the thing questioned or ensue upon the
doing of it shall be such and so great, as the Conueniences that stand on the
other side shall not be able to counteruaile, there the action is worthily
disallowed as Inconvenient, and a Lot consequently unlawful.

Thus in public affairs for the giving of some few private men contentment to
admit a Lot where the admission of it may in likelihood prove prejudicial to
the public, were an unwise course and an unwarrantable, because the public
weighing down the private makes the action inconvenient. Where it is worth the
observing that albeit among the Romans the ordinary employments of their
Officers, and many other affairs were ordered oft-times by Lot, yet Sic cum

the regard of the common good prevailed so far with them that they would not
hearken unto them to put that to the hazard of a Lot, where the event might
prove much inconvenient, which otherwise ordinarily they did.

That is not true therefore that one of our Writers says, that Clem. Edmund on
Caesar's comment. l. 1. c. 20.
Rome directed the maine course of her government by the Fortune of this
mocke-destinie. For neither were the Officers themselves ordinarily chosen by
Lot, neither did they retain the use of it in matters of special weight or
difficulty: the only constant use of it was in dividing the Provinces and
Jurisdictions, as if the Judges with us should cast Lots for their Circuits;
and the two in each Circuit whether should sit upon private suites, and whether
upon public pleas. Which course also as they brake, where the imploiments were
of more special importance; so, if in using the Lot, it fell not out so, as
seemed behouefull for the State, Mummio Praetori Sardinia e^enerat: sed ca
propter belli magnitudinem consularia f^cta est. Liu. l. 41. ann. 577. Baebio

iussus. Liu. l. 37. ann. 565.
they made bold, as they might well do, to control the Lotery, and to dispose
of things otherwise.

Thus again howsoever it were not unlawful simply, for many to join together
in a Lotery (as well as in a free contribution, which Job 42.11.
Jobs friends sometime did) for the raising again of an honest man by crosses
and casualties fallen behind hand: yet for a State to give way to public
courses in that kind Decoctores quidam in blanchis, vt aiunt, suis sortibus
vtuntur. Post el. de Magistr. Athen. c. 8. A notable abuse so used. Perkins of
witchcraft.
for the raising and enriching of some one decayed Banckrupt' by the probable
damage, yea and impouerishing of many others, that out of hope to gain great
matters may wring and wrong both themselves and their whole families thereby,
may well seem scarce warrantable, considering the hindrance of many therein
procured for the helping of some one.

Thus lastly how soever in goods bought in common, because (...). Plato de leg.
l. 6.
men may be many times contentiously minded, and ready to take discontent even
in the equallest courses; yea because men commonly in these cases Fertilior
seges est alien^^ semper in aruis; Vicinumque pecus grandius vber habet. Ovid.
art^^ l. 1. Aliena nobis, nostra plus alijs placent. P. Syrus.
are wont to think that better, that goes from them, though indeed it be not
so; and that less that comes to them, though it be the better part; when
division has been made with as much equality as may be, or with such
inequality as they shall both agree upon, it is a course not lawful and
convenient only, but even laudable and commendable, for mutual satisfaction,
by Lot to assign each one his share: yea how soever in this, or in the like
case; when a man's goods are so mixed with another in whose hands they both
are; it were not unlawful for a man to put his whole right to them to the
hazard of a Lot, for the procuring and purchasing of his peace, which cannot
otherwise be had, with one whom he would not by any means, if it lay in his
power, be at ods with the thing it self being no other then he may well forgo;
yet for a man in such a case to put that to the hazard of a Lot, when he may
otherwise recover it, which his estate will not bear, or may be otherwise more
prejudicial both to him and his, were not lawful, because the damage that
thereby might accrue, would be greater, then could free such an action from
imputation of evident inconvenience.

7. For the latter point of Expediency and Inexpediencie the general rule is,
that that which is no necessary duty, but a thing indifferent only otherwise,
may not be done, where there is strong presumption upon good ground, that it
shall spiritually endanger a man's self, or others, by giving occasion of sin
unto the one or the other.

I except necessary duties; because such are not to be omitted, though they
may be occasion of sin unto others, or though we our selves cannot do them
without some sin. Matib. 10.27, 28, 34, 35, 36. and 15.12, 14. ^
Not for the sin of others; for there is no duty so holy but that many may
and will take occasion of evil by: even 2. Cor. 2.16.
the ministry of the word turns to the evil of not a few, which yet is 1.
Cor. 9.17. Ezech. 2.5.6.7.8.
not in that regard to be neglected or omitted, because man's corruption cannot
free any from the employment that God enjoineth him.

Nay, nor for our selves and our own sins are such duties to be forborne.
For then should no good work at all be done of us; because Romans 7.15, 16, 17,
23. and 8.26.
we can do none so, but that some sin will stick to us in the doing of it.
Wootton ansvv. to Pop. Art. 2.
As a diseased Person therefore ought not to forbear his food, and by fasting
to starve himself (as Mihi stat alere m^rbum d^s^st^re. Corn. Nepos in Attict
vita.
Pomponius Atticus Cib^ abstinebat, and admou^nti m^dico, (...), dixerat. Plin.

and Corelius Rufus, absurdly sometime did,) because (...). Hippocr. Aphor. 2.

in feeding his body he shall withal feed his disease; nor a melancholy man
is to pine himself to death, because where he is, he can come by none but
melancholicke food, such as is not so convenient for a man of his
constitution; but is to use such as he can get for the preserving of life where
no other can be had: so in this case men are not to give over hearing the word,
praying, participating in holy things and the like, because they cannot hear
so attentively, pray so devoutly, receive so reverently, and religiously as
they would and should; but 2. Chron. 30.18, ^9.
endeavor to do all such good duties as God requires of them so well as they
can, leaving the issue and event of the work to the good providence of God in
regard of others, to his gracious acceptance in regard of themselves.

But in things indifferent, and such as are no necessary duties, Matthew. 18.6,
7. 1. Cor. 8.9, 10, 11.
for a man to do that which in great likelihood may spiritually endanger an
other, is to make himself guilty of soule-murther; Exponere se periculo
pecca^i, est peccatum. Bonauent. in 4. did. 17. Gerson. in regul. mor.
Caietan. in sum.
to do that which may spiritually endanger himself, is to make himself
guilty of selfe-murther. And surely, if it be unlawful and Matthew. 4.6, 7.
a tempting of God for a man needlessly (...).
to plunge himself into danger of death in regard of his body; it is no less
unlawful, yea a far greater sin rather, for a man to do the same in
regard of his soul. Besides that Gods commandments not only forbid sin,
but even Cum virtutibus and vitijs sanciuntur and vetantur tria ista, causae,
occasiones, media. Alsted. system. theol. l. 2. c. 3.. 2. can. 7.
whatsoever may be a means and an occasion of sin, though it be not
sinful of it self.

Needless therefore and unnecessary Loteries though in things otherwise not
unlawful, where they are likely to cause, or by experience are found to
occasion much sin, are so far forth unwarrantable, because in that regard
inexpedient. In respect whereof howsoever it were no unwarrantable course, in a
matter of common or public benefit, as the reparation of a bridge, reedifying
of an Hospital, erecting of a school or the like, for diverse men of good
ability to agree among themselves to put it to hazard what sums each of them
shall disburse or dispend toward the discharge or support thereof, the sums
being no greater then the estate of any of them may well bear, when they
cannot readily agree upon a rate otherwise; as also for the better
encouragement of either other in that kind, in common equally to contribute
toward the price of a jewel, or some one of them to convert his part into some
such commodity, to be conferred upon some one of them so contributing, whom by
Lot it shall light to, their minds and states probably known either to other,
I see here no reason why it should be unlawful. But for a man in this kind to
put that to hazard which he knows or probably suspecteth that he shall be
unable well, or unwilling on such terms to part with; the loss whereof in
that regard may either disable him to the doing of other necessary duties, or
distemper him and so make him guilty of sin in Gods sight; or to join with
others needlessly in such an act, much more to draw them in and incite them
thereunto, whom he knows not upon good presumptions to be both able and
willing; by means whereof they may be occasioned to sin in the same sort;
especially in such an action as he cannot but see to be so carried that many
abuses are committed in it, and occasion given by it of much evil; I cannot
see how a man should be free from sin in so doing; neither can I conceive with
what comfort of conscience a man can receive or retain what a Lot in such a
case shall cast upon him, coming in all likelihood in part out of the purses
of those, as either are altogether unable to part well with such sums, but
have strained themselves thereunto out of a greedy desire and hope of lucre and
gain; or being unwilling to loose and to part with what they put in, do in
that regard wretchedly curse and blaspheame Gods name for the loss of it.
Nonfaci^^ adducor licitum consentire, quod tot parturit illicita. Bern. de
consider. lib. 3.
Which occasions of evil being seen or foreseen, cannot but make such
Loteries unlawful to all those that partake in them, in regard of the
inconueniencie, and inexpediencie that is in them. The more able therefore and
willing a man may be to sustain such loss as by Lot may befall him, the
lawfuller the Lot is. And the better known they are to be such whom a man
deals with in matter of Lot, especially where the occasion is rather
voluntary then necessary, the more warrantable is the Lot.

To conclude briefly the grounds of this twofold caution: the event of Lot is
casual: but the doing of Gods will in the avoiding of things evil either in
themselves or by consequence is necessary: and therefore no sit matter to be
put to the casual event of a Lot. Again the use of a Lot is to determine some
question or doubt: but no question ought to be made or doubt to be moved, of
the committing of any moral evil, or the omitting of any necessary good duty,
of the doing what God forbids, or the not doing what he enioyneth: no Lot
therefore may lawfully be used about such. Lastly what a man may not do though
a Lot should determine it, that it is in vain to put to the determination of a
Lot: but Nihil inhomestu^ promit^as: quin siquid promiseris, tolerabilius est
promissum non facere, quem facere quod turpe sit. Ambr. offic. l. 3. c. 12.
Tolerabilius talisacramento periuriu^. Ibid. Iurauit David temere, sed non
impleuit inratione^ maiore peitate. 1 Samuel 25.32. Aug. de diverse. Sermon. 11.
for an oath, to observe it, a man may not do evil; much less for a Lot:
such things therefore may not be put thereunto.

Whereas therefore all moral actions are of three kinds in relation to Gods
law, Praecepta, prohibita, permissa.
some simply enjoined, as are all necessary duties, some simply inhibited as
are all moral evils, some freely permitted and left to our choice, as are all
actions indifferent: the rule here is that a Lot has his lawful use (...).
Chrysipp. offic. l. 6. apud Plut. de Stoic. contrar. Sors enim est. res
incertissima, qua res graves quaelibet (...) possunt definiri. Baro. in Ion. c.
1.
in indifferent things only, such as may without either offense or
inconvenience be done or left undone. In regard whereof the greater the
indifferency is in the event of it which way soever it fall out, the more
lawful the Lot is: and so (contrary to that which is commonly delivered and
almost generally received,) the less weighty the matter is wherein a Lot is
used, the lawfuller the Lot is.

8. Now these Cautions were concerning the matter wherein Lots are used: there
follow two other concerning the manner how they are to be used in such matters.

Where the former Caveat or Caution is that a man be willing to forgo and part
with what he puts to the hazard of a Lot: as before for the matter it self,
that it be such as he may be willing to part withal: (for that a man may be
willing sometime to part with, what he may not lawfully part with) so now for
the disposition of the party in such an action, that he be willing', if it
shall so fall out, to sustain some loss, and so much loss, as may befall him
by the Lot. The reason is evident: because otherwise a man does that
unadvisedly that may afterward discontent him, and be an occasion of sin to
him. Again that which is put to the hazard of a Lot is in a manner forgone, so
far forth, as it is put thereunto. A man ought therefore to be willing to
forgo that, if the Lot shall put it from him, which he is content to cast upon
the Lot, which may put it from him.

But here may some say, Is a man then bound to be willing to depart with his
known right, because he may in some cases commit it to such hazard? or may he
not in such case lawfully desire to obtain it?

I answer: As 1. Cor. 6.7.
a man is bound not absolutely but conditionally to depart with his right, when
a greater evil may ensue upon the recovery of it by such means as he has
only to recover the same by, though he may lawfully otherwise desire to
obtain it: so in this case where a man is willing rather to loose it, then to
seek it by other courses, and as willing to put it to the hazard of a Lot as
to loose it, (for else were it a folly for him to put it thereunto) he ought to
be no less willing, having yielded so far, to part with it, when it shall be
so past; howsoever he might otherwise not unlawfully desire, what he might
lawfully retain, if with conueniencie it might be had.

The rule then here is that no man put that to the hazard of a Lot, which he
could not be willing to forgo upon the like terms without it.

9. The last Caution is that no Intentio non sit inquirere voluntat^m Dei modo
extraordinario; quia talum dus ^mni^ e est incertus. Delrio disq. mag. tom. 3.
l 4. c. 4. q. 1.
special or immediate decision, no extraordinary work be expected from God
for the directing of the Lots in a certain course: nor ought concluded to that
purpose out of the event of them. For Peccatum est te^tationis Dei exp^tere
a^que exp^ctare a Deo vt ipse sorts dirigat, quando ipse id se facturam non
promisit. Bellarm. decler. l. 1. c. 5
to expect any such thing is to presume of more then God has promised: seeing
that Sortibus affu^urum se minimie repromisit. Delrio. mag tom. 3. l. 4. c. 4.
q. 1.
he has no where promised any special providence in such cases, to do men
right by such means, to justify their quarrels, to direct the Lot as the
equity of the cause shall require, or to interpose himself and his providence
in such courses otherwise then in any other of our actions, be they casual,
contingent or necessary. And therefore to put ought to hazard with expectation
of such an act of Gods providence is to presume of that which God has not
promised: (that wherein many of the Heathens Loteries were not free from some
fault) to make trial of it is to tempt God; I mean, to put ought to the
hazard of a Lot to this end, thereby to try whether God will in such special
manner interpose himself for our benefit, the recovery of our right, or the
clearing of our cause; that is in effect, whether he will extraordinarily work
for us at our will. Which therefore as to presume or expect before hand without
good ground is hardly religious; so to conclude ought to that purpose afterward
from the issue and event of it, is undoubtedly superstitious.

In Lots therefore of this nature, Contingit alique^ diuisoria sort vti, non
quasi requirat diuinum iudicium, sed quasi committat fortunae. Thom. desort. c.
5. and Lyra in Prou. c. 16.
the thing hazarded must be put wholly to Iudice fortuna cadat alea. Petron.

the casual or uncertain event of the Lot in regard of the act of the
Creature, though Visatur Malder. de superstit. c. 7. dub. 9.
not excluding the providence of God from the action, no more then from other
civil affairs managed by counsel and advice; (which he may also, if the
thing be weighty, be entreated by prayer to interpose, but so far forth
only as he shall see fit) yet Minus ergo solidum quod Plato de leg l. 6.
(...). Sed and quod Aug. Epist. 180. Qui manea^t, qui fugiant sort legenda,
etc. quia Deus melius in huiusmodi ambagibus, quam homines iudicat. Sed and

Peuc^r. de diuinat. c. de s^rt. and Tolet. in sum. cas. consc. l. 4. c. 15. and
Piscat. ad I^n. c. 1.
not expecting any extraordinary or immediate hand of God for the carriage of
it so as in right it ought to go, or as is best that it should go: because
neither do we know how far forth God sees it fit to interpose his
providence therein, neither has he left us any promise in his word general or
special, that he will immediately at any time or upon any occasion enterpose it
in that manner. In division therefore of Lands made as equal as may be with
conueniencie, yet so as there is still some apparent inequality, in regard
that the things cannot well otherwise be parted, for a man because in equity
he has right to the best part, as the eldest in an inheritance that goes
equally among all, to expect an extraordinary hand of God for the disposing of
it according to the right as in equity it ought to go, is unwarrantable.

As also to conclude, when two stand for a place, that the one is fitter and
more sufficient for it then the other, because the question between them being
put to Lot, the Lot lighted on him, as if God by that event had given sentence
on his side, is no less unwarrantable.

10. The rules then here are first, that Lots determine no right: and that Non
vt per came decernatur quid in reru^ diuisione magis expediat ^ sed vt quod
ratione diffiniri non potest, saltem fortunae relinquatur. Thom. de sort. c. 4.
Lots consequently are to be used in these cases not for matter of right, but
for matter of fact only, and that not of fact past, but of fact future alone;
not In causis iudicialibus aut criminalibus vti non licet. Baro in Ien. cap. 1.
Nam quod hus traehunt Chytr. in Iud. c. 1. and Lauat. in Prou. c. 16. Iudices
ita missis in vrnam calculis far solitos sententiam, vt albis absoluerent,
atris damnarent, etc. nihil quicquam ad sortem pertinet: immit^ebant enim suum
quisque calculum qualem ipsi visum, non casu fortuito catrahebant.
to decide who has best right to the better part, or who is fittest for the
place, but to determine which of them shall have it and enjoy it, or shall go
away with it. Else we make it not an ordinary but an extraordinary, not a
mere diuisory but a diuinatory Lot, a Lot for divination, not a Lot only for
division, which, as we shall show afterward, is utterly unlawful.

And whereas in terms the civil Lawiers seem to say the contrary, where
they say that Inte^lige quando est question ^uris: secus si facti: quiae tunc
non committitur sorti. Gloss. ad Digest. lib. 5. tit. 1. leg. 14. Imol. and Ias
apud Gomez ad Taur leg. 38.
Lots are to be used not in question of Fact, but in question of Right: yet in
sense they accord with that which we here say, the Lawyers meaning being this
alone, that Lots are not to be used in question of Si factum incertum est,
dicenti incumbit probatio. Panorm. ad 5. decretal. de sortileg. In facti
incertitudine, satius est ^ prounciare, non liquere, quam sorti rem commit:
ere. Greg. Tholoss. de appell. l. 2. c. 19.
Fact past, where the question is whether a thing be done or not done; for that
is no ordinary Lot able to decide; but where some question is who has right
to a thing, in which case notwithstanding the Lot is not used to determine who
in truth has right to it, but who for peace and quietness sake shall enjoy
it, where the right cannot be determined, or who shall have possession of it,
till the right be determined.

Secondly, that no censure of right or wrong be grounded upon Lots: as that no
extraordinary power or providence be expected, so nothing to that purpose upon
the event of it be concluded, as if it ought to have been or gone so, or it
was Gods approving will that it should be so, because so it has fallen out.

But does not the work it self, may some say, manifest Gods will? I answer;
there is a twofold will of God, a disposing will, and a directing will; a will
enforming and a will ouer-ruling: a will prescribing what should be, and a will
preordaining what shall be. Non fit aliquid, nisi omniposens fieri velit, vel
sinendo, vel ipse faciendo. Aug. enchir. c. 95.
When ought therefore is fallen out be it good or bad, it is apparent indeed
that it was Gods will either to perform it or to permit it. For Rom 9.19.
Matthew. 10.29.
nothing can possibly come to pass either without or against his will. But
that it ought in right to have been so, cannot thence be concluded. Else might
we conclude that the Jews ought to have crucified Christ, because God suffered
them so to do, yea Act. 2.23. and 4.28.
he preordained the doing of it. In this case therefore where the matter is put
to a Lot by those in whose power it is so to dispose of it, it may be truly
said, that it was Gods will, to wit, his disposing will, that the Lot should go
as it has gone: But it is no consequent therefore, that according to Gods
directing or enforming will, it ought in regard of right so to have gone as it
has.

CHAP. VI. Of ordinary Lots Lusorious; and of the lawfulness of them.

termed Serious because applied to the determining of more serious affairs. We
are now to proceed unto the latter sort of them, which some term Perki^s of
witchcraft.

so commonly styled, though indeed rather exercises of valor, strength and
actiuitie, or trials of art and skill and dexterity in some faculty, which
were so famous and frequent of ancient times both in Greece and Italy, but
especially among the Greeks.

In or about Game therefore is a Lot said to be used, when either the joining
and beginning, or the issue and event of it is put to some casualty either in
whole or in part.

So that the kinds and courses here used are diverse. For sometime the joining
or beginning of a game or sport only is put to a Lot: As when by it is
determined who shall play and who stay out, or who shall join on a side: which
in shooting is done usually by shuffling of arrows together behind some one
man's back, and then casting them aside the one half one way and the other
half an other way; in bowling by casting a certain number of boules belonging
to several men out of one man's arms at once, and those mating whose bowls
meet nearest together: Or of the two sides whether shall lead and begin;
which at Tables is decided commonly by the casting of most points; in Ches-play
by turning a pawn on the board according to the color of the square or quarter
that it staieth or rests upon, or by the ones guessing at two pawnes hid in
the others two hands. Hellanodicae Elide (...) ( ^^a reponit Sylburg. quod

2. Now in these cases a Lot is used though about game, yet rather out of it
then in it, only to make a beginning and entrance into it: But otherwhiles it
is used for the directing of the game it self and the issue of it either in
part or in whole.

In part only, as in those games, wherein beside the Lot, art and industry
is required for the further managing of that which has thereby been allotted:
as in many games at Cards and Tables, wherein a Lot is indeed used for the
distributing of the Cards amongst the Gamsters, and in assigning each of them
his chance, thereby ministering unto them matter further to work on; but there
is art and skill beside that to be employed by them for the managing of their
game, and for the working upon that which casualty has cast on them. Which
kind of game that it was not either unknown unto, or unusual among the
ancients, beside (...). Eustath. Odys. (...). Et tamen (...). Hesych. Vnde

To which kind of Lot-sports or Lot-games (which shall be the last, and so I
leave them) may their Sorts c^nui^ales. Lamprid. Heliog.
Banquet-loteries be added, which we find two sorts of, some free, some set to
sale, and both containing either matter of free gift, or matter of charge and
expense, or mixed matter of either. For so we read that Suet. Aug. c. 75
Augustus used Saturnalibus, and siquando alias libuisset.
on some Festiuals and at other times by Lot to distribute certain gifts among
his guests, some of worth and value, as gold, silver, and garments, and coins
of all sorts foraine, ancient, and others; and some again mere toies and
triffles, as Cilicia, spongias, rutabula, forpices.

Poesies upon them Titulis obscuris and ambiguis.
of doubtful and double sense, seeming to glaunce at and nip them to whose Lot
they were fallen. So likewise that monster of men Lamprid. Heliogab.
Heliogabalus, a second Nero, used to propound to whom he pleased, both in
public and private, certain mixed Lots, some matter of gift, some matter of
charge, of such extreme inequality, that some were neither mended nor impaired
at all, but mocked only, Vt vere sorts essent, and fata te^tarentur.
some were made, as we say, and some utterly undone by them: for some according
to that they drew were to pay in and lay down, either a pound of beef, or a
dead dog, or ten flies, or ten fleas, or ten bears, or ten camels, or so many
pounds of lead, or as many of silver, or gold, etc. And others again were to
receive the like, as their Lot came: which made many rich that were poor
before, and others as poor that were rich before: the monster delighting in
nothing more then in the mischief and miseries of many. And these Lots were
sometimes either written or painted In cochlearibus. Lamprid.
on their spoones, as we have commonly on fruite-trenchers painted emblemes and
poe^ies, that sometime we use to make sport withal somewhat after that
manner. Again sometime were such Lots as these in mirth set to sale: for Su^t.

so used Augustus to do sometime with his Lots; as also with pictures showing
the backside of them only; in merriment propounding them to thoe fthat were at
board with him, that none might come in but upon a price to draw in the one, and
he that would at adventure bid most, should have the other. Not altogether

some referring them to the head of serious diuisory Lots, as containing a
twofold virtuall contract, the one of bargain and sale between all the
adventurers jointly and the owner or owners of the prize or prizes that they
are to draw for, as making sale thereof unto them for such a sum as all their
adventures put together amount unto; and another of society or fellowship
between the Adventurers among themselves, agreeing to draw Lots or cast dice
for that which in common they have so bought: Venditio sine re intelligitur,

Or, as in running, as they term them, and unlimited Loteries, a single
contract only of bargain and sale between the Owner and the Adventurers, not
unlike altogether that wherein a Fishermans draught or a Fowlers fortune, or a

used mostly to help and releive either base Spend-thrifts or beggarly
Banckrupts. And thus have we seen in what diverse manner Lots have been or may
be used in or about game.

of hazard, as they are termed, wherein a Lot is thus used, and there is
therefore a kind of Lotery in them, there is much question and disputation
among the learned: and diverse reverend and religious pass a peremptory
sentence upon them as altogether unlawful and unbeseeming good Christians.

Yet among those also that oppugn and oppose them there is diversity of
opinion. For Concedi p^ssun^ ludi qui partim casu, par^^in industriae nituntur.

some of them allow those games that are carried partly by casualtie and partly
by skill, which they suppose not to come within compass of Lots, condemning
those only that depend wholly upon casualtie. Others of them Fennor of lawful
recreations cap. 4. Balmford dialogue of pames consisting of chance.
utterly and absolutely reject all that have any spice of Lotery or casualty at
all in them. This of those that deal more distinctly in the point: For Ludus

rather of some of them whether they concur at all with either, or do not
rather upon other grounds diverse from theirs, disallow some of these games, not
all of them, or not all manner use of them, as of some other hereafter shall
plainly appear.

But to return to the two former sorts, it is well observed by Balmf^rd di^log.
one of the latter rank of them, that some of the reasons produced by the
former for the disallowing of the one kind, if the grounds be admitted, cannot
choose but condemn both kinds. For if the one be evil and not allowable
because they depend upon Lot and Chance, then the other must likewise be evil
and unwarrantable so far forth as in part also they depend thereupon. And on
the other side if those former Authors will avow and justify the one, they
cannot but secretly withal give sentence also for the other, since they stand
both on the same ground, and are built both on one botome.

For as for that which Non est alea proprie dicta. Dan. lud. al c 6. Alea

some say distinguishing the nature of these games, that the one is Lotery but
not the other, or that there is a Lot in the one, but not in the other. It is
true indeed, that if we define a Lot so, as diverse of them do, to be Sors

there is no Lot at all either in the one or in the other. But if we understand
a Lot as it was formerly defined according to the proper, and ordinary
signification of it, so there is a Lot as much and as well in the one as in the
other, the only difference is that there is a mere Lot in the one, a mixed Lot
in the other, but a true Ars aleatoria and ipsa tota sortil^ga est. Agrip. de
van. scient. c. 14. Ad sorte^ reuocatur alea, i. ludi qui ab ancipiti casu

Lot in either.

For the argument that Perkins Cases of Consc. l. 3. c. 4. 3. q. 2.
a reverend Writer of ours brings to prove the contrary, because in a Lot
there are two things required; first a casual act, and secondly an applying of
that casual act to the determination of some particular and uncertain event;
whereas the dealing of the Cards is a casual act indeed, but the determination
of the uncertain victory is not in mixed games merely from it, but much or
most from the wit and skill or the will of the player: and therefore the
dealing of the cards is no more a Lot then the dealing of alms is, when the
Princes Almoner puts his hand into his pocket, and gives one man six pence,
another 12. pence, another two pence, what comes forth without further
advice. This argument, I say, is not sound, because it reasons from a
particular to a general; The dealing of the Cards is not applied to the
determining of this uncertain event, to wit, the maine issue of the game or
the victory: therefore it is not applied to the determining of any uncertain
event at all. Which consequence is unsound; as also the consequent is untrue.
For it is manifest that the dealing of the cards is applied to the determining
of this uncertain event, what cards or casts each one shall have to exercise
his skill with: and is therefore even by his own description a Lot: as is also
the dealing of alms in that sort, if it be done for that end, to try what
will casually fall to each ones share by such a course, as well as if it were
done by drawing of rushes or cuts, which go commonly for Lots.

For the thing it self I hold that these Lusorious Lots, and Games consisting
of such are not simply or in that regard evil or unwarrantable: or in a word,
that a Lot used in game is not unlawful. In which assertion if I shall dissent
from some others of religion and learning, whom otherwise I worthily respect
and embrace, I desire but to have my grounds duly viewed and examined, that if
they prove firm and sound, the frame built on them may stand, if weak and
unsound, it may fall before the truth, as 1. Sam. 5.4.
Dagon did before God's Ark, my self promising to lend an hand with the first
to the ouerturning and razing of what I now rear, if it shall be showed me to
be other then is warrantable by Gods word.

4. The former grounds therefore laid concerning the nature of Lots in
general, the reasons that induce me to allow Lots of this kind as not evil
in themselves among others are these.

First, that which may be ordinarily used in other civil affairs, be they
more weighty or of less weight, that may also be used for matter of recreation
and delight. But a Lot may be ordinarily used in other civil affairs, as, by
the express Prou. 18.18.
authority of Gods spirit speaking by Solomon, for the ending of contentions,
and matters in suite or strife, be they weightier or of less weight: For the
words in the text are indefinite, neither is there ought to restrain the
ordinary use of them in that kind either there or elsewhere. The word used
there, though in its original propriety it signify (...) si^e (...) a (...)
vel (...) iudicare.
Law-suites, yet in the ordinary Prou. 6 14.19. and 10.12. and 15.18. and 16
28. and 17.14. and 18.19. and 19.12. and 21.9.19. and 22.10. and 23.29. and
25.24. and 26.20.21. and 27.15. and 28.25. and 29.22.
use of it it extends it self to contentions of all kinds. And the practice
of Gods people recorded in Scripture shows that even mean matters have been
decided and determined usually by Lot: as in matter of Tithe, though it were
not much material, which Lamb the Leuite had, so that he had one of ten, two
of twenty, etc. yet was it decided Leuit. 27.32. and Iun. in annot.
by Lot. It was a matter of no great weight what gate of the Temple such or
such Levites should wait at; I say not, that it was a mean matter to be a
Porter in Gods house, (though Psalm 84 10. (...) ad limen residere. Le^ Iud.
Limen freque^tare. Iun. abiectus Vulg. ad locum co^munem and ignobilem reijci.

affix^^, vt Exodus 21 6. ^. v^lissim: condition ibi agere, (...) quam alibi
libere ag^ntem c^mmorari. Inde enim (...) ^i er^aes. Leyfeild.
it seem to be mentioned as one of the meanest places of employment there;)
but whether company should wait at this gate, and whether at that other gate,
(as who should stand at the North door of the Church, and who at the South, to
receive peoples benevolence, upon occasion of some collection) was no matter of
great moment, and yet was that also decided 1. Paral. 26.13, 14, etc.
by Lot. Neither was it greatly material which of the Priests offered incense,
or which dressed the Lamps, etc. so it were done by some one of them, yet that
also went Luk 1.9.
by Lot. Since that Lots therefore may lawfully be used in other ordinary
affairs, Gods word indefinitely warranting it, the same elsewhere not
restraining it, and the practice of the godly carrying it even to mean matters
(for Parum it aque cause Martyr ad 1. Sam. c. 10. sortibus de^ignabantur
Sacerdotia.
the offices themselves were not put by them to Lot, but the distribution of
particular duties or stations among those of the same office) I see not what
should banish them out of our disports, more then out of other our (though
serious, yet) civil affairs.

5. Secondly, if we consider aright the nature of a Lot, and the great
uncertainty of it, we shall find it fittest for such matters as are of least
moment, and Sorsest resinc^^tissima q^ares gra^^es quaelibet non ^^ss^nt
desin^ri. Baro ^n Ion. c. 1 No^ ^^cet v^i in causis iudiciali^us aut

p^strid^e repud^sset. S^et. Tiber. c. 35.
not fit to be used in any weighty affair. In regard whereof, as those that
make use of it in serious matters, are wont, with all the Caution they can, so
to dispose of things beforehand, that it may not be material which way the
Lot light, or that as little, as may be, be left unto it: s^ where it may be
material and of some consequence whether it go the one way or the other, (I
say not now what the iniquity of others may enforce a man unto; a less
inconvenience is allowable for the avoiding of a greater;) there (...) ^^
(...). Plato de leg. l. 6. Vise and quae supra c 5. 5.6. (...). S^er apud
Xen^ph. (...).
will no wise man willingly put such a matter of weight to the uncertain
hazard of a Lot. That therefore that best sorteth with the nature of a Lot, may
a Lot most lawfully be used unto: but the lightest matters best sort with the
nature of a Lot: and therefore about things of that nature may a Lot most
lawfully be used. Or more particularly for the present business: A matter of
mere indifferency, that is, such as a man may lawfully either do or not do,
and it is not material whether he do or omit, such may a man lawfully put
either to the will of an other, or to the hazard of the uncertain motion of
any creature whether he shall do it or not do it. But the using of a Lot in
game (or the using of it in any business, be it serious or lusorious, qualified
and cautioned as before) is but the putting of a matter of mere indifferency
to the hazard of an uncertain event, to wit, who shall join or stand out, who
shall lead or follow, who shall overcome or yield to the other side etc. which
are matters merely indifferent, such as may without sin be either done or
forborne, either done the one way or the other. The Use therefore of a Lot in
such cases, and the putting of such matters to the hazard of a Lot is not evil
simply in it self.

6. Thirdly, if the Use of Lots in game be of it self evil, then must it
needs be a sin either against Piety in the first Table, or against Charity
in the second. For every moral evil must needs be a (...). 1. Joan. 3.4.
(...). R^m. 4.15.
breach of Gods Law, the whole sum and substance whereof being comprised in
those Deuteronomy. 10.4 december verba: fine dec^m edi^^a. Sic enim Est. 3.15. and 4.3.
and 8.14. etc. (...)
ten Edicts of those Exodus 31.18. D^ut. 9.10. and 10.^
two Tables, every breach thereof must of necessity be brought within compass
of the one of those twain, and so consequently convinced to be a branch either
of Impiety against the one, or of Iniquity against the other.

But the Use of Lots in game is not in it self, or of it self a sin either
against Piety, or against Charity.

To spend time and words in proouing that the use of a Lot in game as it is a
Lot, is not against Charity, as that it is no breach of Charity for men to
draw Cuts or cast Arrows, who shall boule or shoot first, were both
superfluous and ridiculous; superfluous, because it were to prove what no man
denies; ridiculous, because it were to confute what no wise man will avow. And
yet to charge a lusorious Lot with Impiety, has as little ground as the other.

For the manifesting here of let thus much be considered, that all Impiety may
be referred to these Ezech 22.4.26.
two heads, either the profaning of hallowed things, or the hallowing of
things profane: since it cannot be imagined how any impiety should be
committed but either by denying holy things their due respect, or by giving the
same where it is not due. But lusorious Lots are not of themselves guilty in
either of these kinds. In the latter kind even their greatest adversaries
will clear them, there being no color to charge them with the hallowing of
ought that is not otherwise holy. And in the former kind they may be cleared
also by the grounds of Gods Law, to wit, from the profaning of ought that is
holy. For the thing used in them is a Lot: and nothing can be profaned by
them but what is used in them: (by Lots, I mean simply as they are Lots, for
to make Lots of holy things, as of parcels of Scripture, or of the Elements
consecrate in the Sacrament, etc. is not any thing concerning the nature of a
Lot, but an abuse cleaving to it in some particular men's practice of it, and
such as is to be severed therefore in this our discourse from it.) But a Lot is
no holy thing, either of it self and in it own nature, or by virtue of any
divine institution. For of these two sorts are all holy things whatsoever,
either they are holy of themselves and in their own nature, as I^sh. 24.19.
Esai 6.3. Psalm. 99.5.9.
God himself, and Psalm. 111.9 and 99.3.
his titles and attributes are, or else they come to be such, whereas in their
own nature they are not, by means of some special divine institution
sanctifying and seuering them to some holy use, as Number. 4.5.15. and 7.89.
Leuit. 16.2.
the Arc, Exodus 29.42, 43, 44. and 30.25, 26, 29.
the Tabernacle, Psalm 5.7. and 11.4. and 65.4. and 68.5
the Temple, Genesis 2.3. Exodus 20.8, 11. and 31.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
the 7. day of the world before Christ, and Apoc. 1.10. Act. 20.7. 1. Cor. 6.2.
the first day of the week since Christ. Now in neither of these respects can
a Lot be said to be holy, not of it self, or in it own nature, for it is
nothing else but any casual event applied to the determining or deciding of
some doubt: Where the matter of it, a mere casualtie, as it is a casualtie
having no holiness at all in it of it self (for Quod conuenit ^ali, quatenus,
tale, conu^nit omni tal^.
then should all casualties in like manner be such) can much less gain or
procure any holiness to it self by any man's application of it to any end
whatsoever, much less by the applying of it to a profane or common end, be it
more or less weighty.

Neither is a Lot holy by any divine institution; since every such institution
must have warrant from some word; and there cannot be produced any word of
institution whereby Lots are specially sanctified and set apart to such uses as
may bring them within the compass of things holy and sacred. If any particular
Lots have at sometime been so used, that can no more impart holiness to all
Lots in general, then the religious use of Job. 2.26.31. Ephesians. 5.26.
water in Baptism, yea in the Matthew. 3.16. Luke 3.21.
Baptism of our SAVIOVR, and the sacred use of Matthew 26.26.27.28.29. 1. Cor.
11.23, 24, 25, 26, 27.
bread and wine in the Lords supper can Vi^e Casau^. ad Baron. annal. ann. 31.
number. 19. contra Chrysostom. ^^mil. de bapt. Chr. and Jacob. de Vitria^. c. 54.
make all water or all bread and wine in general to be holy, and so
consequently debar men of the ordinary and common use of those creatures
either for the necessity of nature or for lawful delight.

Those therefore are amiss that allow Lots in game, and yet add for a
Caution, that great reverence and religionsnesse be used in the action; in
regard that Sancta sancte.
Holy things must be done in holy manner. For if Lots in general even civil
as well as sacred be holy things, they may in no case with no Caution be made
matter of sport and pastime, or of gamesome recreation; nor can the light use
of them be so corrected and qualified, but that it will have deadly poison even
in the heart and pith of it, not adhering or cleaving unto the bark or outside
of it only. But civil Lots are not such; and therefore the lusorious use of
them is not the profaning of any holy thing. And if neither the unhallowing of
any thing hallowed, nor the hallowing of any thing unhallowed, then can it not
be brought within compass of impiety or sin against the first Table. And if
it be cleared from all sin against the first Table, and be not charged by any
with any sin against the second Table; it must needs rest discharged of all
sin in general, and consequently be justified as agreeable to Gods word.

7. A fourth argument may be taken from the benefit of Christian liberty, by
virtue whereof every Christian man has Libertatis Christianae pars ^a vt nulla
rerum ex^ernarum per se ^ndifferentium religione coram Deo tene^mur, quiu ^as
n^nc vsurpare, nunc omittere indifferenter l^^eat: huius cognitto si aberit,
nulla conscientijs nostris qui^s, nullus superstitionum fut^rus est fi^is: co
d^mumv nietur, v^ super festuca^ transuers. mincedere nefas ducatur. Ca^uin.
instit. l 3. c. 19 7.
a free use of all Gods good creatures to employ them unto such purposes as by
any Ipsae naturales rerum d^tes satis demonstrant, quorsum and quate^ us
fruiliceat. Ibid. c. 10. 2.
natural power they are enabled unto, within the bounds above mentioned. But
in these ordinary civil and diuisorie Lots be they serious or lusorious, the
creature is used to no other end or use, but what it has a natural power
unto, and Sortilus vti licet in rebus p^testati nostrae subditis. K^akeuitz in
Ion. c 1.
such as by the mutual consent and agreement of those that use it, it may be
enabled to effect. For it is in the natural power of the creature used to
moo^e or to be moved diversely, and uncertainly in regard of those that make
use of it: and it is further in the power of it by their mutual agreement to
determine such matters as are ordinarily wont to be determined thereby. Which
therefore Sors non ^st mala nisi ex admixta irreligi^sitate ^ut inius^ttia au^
imprudentia. Cai^ sum. vit.
so long as the use of it is kept otherwise free from superstition and impiety,
or from injustice and dishonesty, ought no more to be exiled from a Christian
man's recreations, then any other creature or ordinance whatsoever that has any
natural power to delight and give contentment in that kind.

8. A fifth argument may be drawn is conc^ss^s.
from the grounds and Graunts even of those that oppose in this point; and may
be framed on this wise. Any thing indifferent is lawful matter of recreation:
But Lotery is a thing Videtur sortium vsus inter adiapho^a constitui. Gr^g.
Tol^s. syntagm. lib. 34. c. 5.
indifferent: Lotery therefore may be made lawful matter of disport. The
proposition is confirmed by their definition of recreation, to wit, F^un^r of
recreat. rules spec. 1.
Christian recreation is the exercise of something indifferent for the
necessary refreshing of body or mind.

The assumption, namely, that Lotery is a thing in it own nature indifferent,
is thus proved likewise by their definition of things in nature indifferent.
Idem ibid. 2. rule 1.
Indifferent in nature is that which is leaf^ free, so as we^ are not simply
commanded or forbidden to use it, but as we shall find it in Christian
wisdom beneficial or hurtful unto us. But such is Lotery, or the use of
Lots; not simply commanded, (for Prou 18.18.
that of Solomon before alleged is rather a permission then a precept, or not
so much a commandment as an advice and counsel, commending that to us as a
wise and prudent course, not enioining or imposing it as a duty necessary to
be done, seeing by other courses beside it such controversies may without sin
be composed as are there mentioned, and that effected often by other means
without a Lot, for which a Lot by Solomon is there allowed) nor again any
where forbidden or condemned as evil in it self: by the former definition
therefore conseuently in different, and so lawful matter of Christian
recreation and delight.

9. Sixthly and lastly, that the Use of Lots in game is not against Gods word,
but has sufficient warrant from it, may appear by this argument. Where the
wisdom of God in his word has not determined the matter, and the manner, or
the other circumstances of a thing lawful in it self, there they are least to
man's discretion and wisdom. Else should we hang ever in perpetual suspense,
having no rule at all to direct us by in them. And where they are left thus to
man's discretion and wisdom, there is warrant sufficient for any circumstance
that man shall make choice of (the Magistrate publicly to enjoin, or private
persons to practice) that shall Quum Scriptura generales legitimi vsus tradat
regulas, secundum illas nobis limit andus est. Calvin institut l. 3. c 10. 1.
not be against the general rules of Gods word concerning the same.

For the better conceiving of this point it is to be considered, that for the
doing of every act, and the doing of it in this or that manner, if natural
reason will not of it self afford sufficient direction, there must be warrant
had out of Gods word: and a man must know that he has warrant thence, because
Romans 14.23.
Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin. I say, where natural reason does not of
it self afford sufficient direction; for the word is given us in moral
matters to supply the defects of it caused by our first Parents their fall; 1.
C^r 9.7.8. and 11.13.14. Ad naturam Apostolus prouocat. Tertll de virg vel. Nec
differt Scriptura quid an ratione consistat. Idem cor. mil.
neither does it abridge us of the help and Romans ^.14.15. Ipsa natura legis
est instar ignorantibus legem. T^rtull ad Marc. l. 5.
use of it for direction in such actions, but add a further and fuller help
thereunto.

First then for the act it self in general; that is of it self good and
lawful and ^allowable by Gods Law, for the doing whereof there is either
precept or permission in Gods word, and that either direct and express, or
collected by just consequence: D^ut. 5 29.32.33. and 12.32 Quod praecipitur,
imperat^r: quod imperatur, necesse est fieri. Tertull. a^ vx^r. l. 2 V^i
praeceptum, necessitas est seruientis. Ibid.
if a precept, it is necessary and must be done; Deuteronomy. 12.15.20.21.22.
if permission only, it is indifferent and may be done or not done, as shall
seem good to the party whom it concerns.

Secondly for the subject matter, the manner of it and other such
circumstances, where they are by Gods word determined, there such only are
lawful as the word of God has enjoined.

Where they are not determined, there all such are lawful as the same word
Concessum videtur quod non prohibetur. Accurs. ad Cod I^st. l. 10. c. 1. l. 4.
does not forbid. In the former that rule holds, Matthew. 12.30. Omnia sunt
probibita, quae non reperiuntur concessa. Gloss. ad Dig. l. 47. c. 23. l. 3.
He that is not with me, is against me: in the latter that other, Luke 9.50.
Omnia per legem sunt permissa, qu^ non inueniuntur prohibitae. Gloss. ad D. l.
4. t. 6. l. 28.
He that is not against me, is with me. Thus for sacrifice and the place of it,
before it was determined, Deuteronomy. 12.8.9. Genesis 8.20. and 12.7. and 13.18. and
20.25. and 26 25. and 33.20. Exodus 17.15 and 14.4.
it was lawful in any place, because no certain place was designed: but after
it was once determined, Deuteronomy. 12.5, 6, 11, 13, 14.
it was lawful in no place but that alone, that God had expressly thereunto
assigned. So for the Passover and other offerings, and the time and season of
either, the ordinary sacrifices (I mean the voluntary or freewill offerings)
Leu. 1.2, 3. and 2.1. Deuteronomy. 12.5, 6, 26, 27.
might be offered at any time, because for them was no time determined: but
Exodus 12.6. Number 9 13.
the Passover might be celebrated only at one time, because the time of it
was determined.

This would the rather be observed for the readier answering of some frivolous
objections made by some Seperatists; What warrant, say they, have you to use
this or that form of prayer, or to pray upon a book? I answer; It is warrant
sufficient that Luke 18.1. 1 Thessalonians. 5.17. 1. Tim. 2.1.8.
we are enjoined to use prayer, and Matthew. 6 9.12. Act. 8.22. 1. John 1.9.
such kind of prayer, confession of sin, and supplication for pardon, etc. no
set form thereof determined; therefore any fit form warrantable: this form
that we use not unfit otherwise; this form therefore allowable. And let a man
demand of one of them when he prays, what warrant he has to use that form
that he then uses, he can answer no otherwise; or if in effect otherwise, he
shall answer otherwise then well. So for a book; the means of help are not
determined; and this one among others; this therefore not unwarrantable. And if
one of them should be asked, how he proves it warrantable to use a printed
book to read on in the Church; he shall not be able to make other answer
then as before: for neither precept nor practice can be found in the word for
the use of a thing that was not known in those times wherein the word of God
was written.

. 10. But to apply this to the present. First, Eccles. 3.4. Zech. 3.10. and
8.5.
Recreation in general is granted by all to have good warrant from Gods word,
as a thing both allowed by permission, and enjoined by precept, if not directly
and expressly, yet at least by just consequence: and therefore I will not stand
upon the proof of it.

Secondly, for the matter and manner of it, ^or the things wherewith we may
recreate our selves, Certum est in diuini^literis nullam de ludis aut regula^
aut formam praescribi; quamuis in eis multa ludorum generae leguntur. Martyr in
Iud. c. 14.
there is nothing determined; any means therefore of recreation that are not
against the general Rules of R^m. 13.13. 1. Cor. 14.40.
comeliness and decency, of 1. Cor. 6 12. and 10 23. Romans 14.21
conueniencie and expediencie, 1. Cor. 10 31. Coloss. 3 17.
of religion and piety, and the like, are by the word of God allowed, and have
from thence sufficient warrant. For example; If question be whether Boules or
Chesse be lawful or no: what can there be said in justification of them more
then this, that recreation in general is by Gods word allowed; the matter of
it in particular not determined: these games not prohibited; therefore lawful
and allowable. Now the very same may be said of Lots and Lotterie. Game in
general is allowed: no particular matter or manner of it prescribed: any
therefore lawful that is not against the general rules of Gods word; this of
Lotterie such; and therefore allowable.

If any shall say, that the particular matter or manner of recreation is
determined, Affirmanti incumbit pr^batio. Paulus in Dig. lib. 22. tit 3. leg.
2. Et Vlpian. ibid. leg. 22.
he must show where. Or if any shall say, that this particular by Lots is
against the general rules of Gods word otherwise, he must show which and how.
Otherwise there is no civil action almost that shall be justifiable, as
Hebraeu and Afiaticis omnibus ignotum and inusitatu^ id genus vest^us, docent

blouddings or ought strangled, and the like, if it shall be deemed enough to
make an action unwarrantable, either because there is no particular precept or
precedent for it in Scripture, or because it is questioned or condemned by some
without any reason or sufficient cause rendered why it should be questioned and
condemned in that sort.

And so I conclude and leave this sixth and last reason taken from the common
grounds of other ordinary recreations not questioned, which must all with this
either stand or fall, the self same grounds supporting either; that this
particular is not prohibited, nor is against the general rules of Gods word
otherwise; which as in the former, so in this case must stand good, till the
contrary can be proved.

CHAP. VII. Answer to the principal Objections made against lusorious Lots.
1. But here will some of the former Authors object and say, we can show how
this kind of disport or recreation by Lots, and the use of a Lot in such cases
is against the general rules of Gods word. And so I come to examine the
several objections that are by several men brought against this kind of
disport. Wherein I will deal as ingenuously, and as indifferently as I am able
to do; propound their arguments as I find them, and as many as I find of
them, not picking out the weakest and passing by the pithiest, or setting down
some part or piece of them and concealing the residue; but as near as I can,
gather all I can find in such Writers as I can understand to have dealt in
this argument, and enforcing them as far as themselves do to their best
strength.

Now this that I may the more orderly do, their arguments shall all of them be
referred to these two heads, the principal, and the less principal.

The principal Arguments I call such as tend to prove them simply unlawful,
and so evil in themselves.

The less principal such as tend to prove them inconvenient and inexpedient,
or such as have been by the most or the best generally disallowed and condemned.

The former may again be sorted into two ranks according to the two Terms
of the thing questioned, A Lot used in recreation, or Recreation by a Lot: for
either they are taken from a Lot and the nature of it, or the proper use and
end of it; or from the nature of recreation, and the use and end of it.

2. The first maine Argument then is taken from the nature of a Lot, which is
affirmed to be a work of Gods special and immediate providence, a sacred
oracle, a divine judgment or sentence: the light use of it therefore to be an
abuse of Gods name; and so a sin against the third Commandment.

The Argument is by diverse Authors diversely molded. From Gods special and
immediate providence they reason first on this wise.

Sorts, in quibus singular: provide atiae argumentum inest, in re l^ui ^on
adhibendas: quod ea ratione quod ammodo Dei prouidentia^ illudimus, etc. Dan.
de lud. aleae c. 9. rat. 1. Et Taffin. de emendat. vit. l. 2 c. 19.. 2. Lots
may not be used but with great reverence, because the disposition of them
comes immediately from God. Perkins golden chain. chap. 20. on command. 3.
Gods immediate or especial providence is not to be vainly or lightly used.

But in every Lot is an especial and immediate providence of God.

No Lot therefore is lightly or vainly to be used.

The Proposition of this Syllogism (such as it is) is further confirmed by an
Argument taken from the tenor of the third Commandment.

Dan. and Perk. ibid.
Gods name is not lightly or vainly to be used.

Gods Providence is Gods name.

Gods Providence therefore is not lightly or vainly to be used.

The Assumption is confirmed by two testimonies: the one divine, a sentence of
Salomons, Dan. ibid.
The Lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposition of it is of the Lord:
Fennor of recreat. rule spec. 4.
So that the nature of a Lot lies wholly in this that although the things be of
us, yet the disposition is wholly of God: that is, he uses not here our means
of cunning, practice, strength, stedinesse of hand or such like, but takes it
wholly to himself. The other humane, a saying of Hierome, Eastie histor. of
Gospel.
Hierome says a Lot is an hidden and incomprehensible predestination, ruled by
God: who dare play with this then?

First the principal Syllogism it self is not sound, there are four
Terms, as they say, in it. I show it by the like Paralogisme built of the
same frame and set upon the same ground.

Gods Providence, being his name, is not to be used lightly, or to recreation
and disport.

But in all things, or in every action that is, there is a Providence of God.

No thing or action therefore may be used to disport.

And so all recreations shall be utterly cut off. This and that are both of
one making: but neither of both sound: the conclusion therefore follows not,
albeit the premises were both true.

Secondly, the Assumption is not sound: it is not true that in every Lot is a
special and immediate Providence of God.

For the discovery hereof let two grounds formerly laid be remembered.

The former, that Chap. 2.. 4. conclus. 1.
the act of the Creator and the act of the Creature are in these cases to be
distinguished. The casual event in regard of the Creature is one thing, and
Gods providence directing and ruling or ouer-ruling it, as all other actions,
is an other thing. A man may play therefore with the one, and yet not with the
other: as we do in those things that are not casual, but are carried and
managed by man's Art and industry, and yet are accompanied also with Gods
providence.

The latter, that Ibid 5 concius. 2.
it is not the casualtie of an Event that makes it a work of Gods immediate
Providence. For many things are casual, which yet are not works of Gods
immediate providence, nor imply his special presence. Whereas if a Lot in
regard of the casualtie of it were a work of Gods immediate providence, and
did in that regard imply his special and extraordinary presence, then all
casual events should be such. For Quod conuenit tali, quatenus tale, conuenit
omni tali.
that which agrees to a thing as it is such or such, agrees necessarily to
all things that are such. But for a foul to fly before a man on his way, or
for a dog to cross a man's boule in play, and that it may be, where there is no
likelihood of doing well otherwise, implies not any special or immediate
Providence: no more therefore does a Lot.

. 3. But let us examine the proofs brought to strengthen this part. First for
the sentence of Solomon, there want not good Authors that expound it of De
singularibus, mirabilibus, diuinis, quas disterminant a politicis. Chytrae. in
Iud. c. 1. Io. Winkelman prof^ss. Marpurg. and Barth^ld. Krakeuitz in Ion. c.
1. and Peucer. de diuinat.
singular, extraordinary, and miraculous Lots only: such, to use the words of
one of our Eastie lust. Gosp.
Adversaries, as are used immediately to find out Gods will: whereas these
that we now dispute of are no such; Authors praenominati.
neither is it now lawful to use any Lot at all to that end.

But the words seem to be more general, and are word for word thus in the
original, Prou. 16 33. (...) Sicut Number. 26.55. (...) terra^ lamen (quod
attinet) sort diuidetur. Et N^hem. 9.32. (...) ne sit ^arum tib^, tota^ haenc
molestiam (quod attinet.)
The Lot, it is cast into the lap; (...) ^moe indiciu^ cius. M^rcer.
but every judgment or disposition of it (for there is no article there
answering our English The) is of God. As he says elsewhere, Prou. 29.26.
Many seek the Rulers face or favor; (...)
but each man's judgment is from God. And, Prou. 21.31.
The Horse is prepared for the day of fight: (...) sicut Psalm. 3 9. (...) Et
Ion. 2.9. (...)
but salvation is of God, or belongs to God, is Gods. Which words so read
Dicere vult omnia gubernari a diuina prouidentia, etiamsi nobis casu quodam
fieri videantur, vt id quod sort alicui contingit: qualis prouidentia in alijs
omnibus euentibus, quamuis maxim fortuitis cernitur: nec tollit ista communis
prouidentia casum. Bellarm de cleric. l. 1. c. 5.
import only thus much, that there is a providence of God in all things, even
in the least, in the most casual things, and among the rest by name in a Lot:
And so is there no more said of Lots there, then is spoken elsewhere not of
Lots alone or things casual only; but of all men's thoughts and purposes, and
words and works, and counsels and courses; as we have Chap. ^.. 3.
formerly shown; and as beside the Authors there alleged, some of those that
urge this place for the proof of this point confess elsewhere against
themselves when they say, that (...) ford. dialog. Et Zanch. de sort. Deum
omnia regere, igitur sorts etiam.
The disposing of the Chance is secret that it may be Chance indeed and
wholly of God, who directs Prou. 16.1, 3.9^ 33. Balmf. ibid.
all things.

Yea take the words as they are usually read, The Lot is cast into the lap, but
Geneu. translat*
the whole disposition, or 7 b^ Kings Edit^.
the whole disposing thereof, is of the Lord; It may as truly be said with
good warrant from diverse Psalm. 33.10, 11, 13, 14, to 20. and 37.6, 7, 9, 12, to
16 and 127.1, 2. Prou. 10.22. and 19.21. and 20.24. and 21.30, 31. Esai 26.12.
and 34.15, 16. Ierem. 10.23. Matthew. 6.26, 30. and 10.29, 30.
other places of Scripture beside supra.
those by the Adverse party produced; that the whole issue or event and
disposing of all things great and weighty, or less and lighter is of the
Lord: Which yet excludes not the means, that God works by or with, in the
most of them, nor implies an immediate providence universally in them: but is
therefore so said, and may truly be said, to show, that it is wholly in Gods
hands to dispose of the event and issue of all things, and to cross or give
way to them, as he shall see good. So that a man may as well, and upon as good
ground out of the places concerning all other men's speeches and actions
alleged by themselves, (together with those other, which are some of them yet
more general and of larger extent) exclude all things else whatsoever from
game, as they may Lots, in regard of ought that concerning them can be picked
out of this place.

4. If it be objected, that It rules in all: but in the most by means; in a
Lot it is immediate: which therefore to dally with is dangerous. East. hist.
Gosp. reas. 5.
there is an immediate providence of God ever in the one but not usually in the
other.

I answer, that indeed is presumed, that in every Lot there is an immediate
providence of God: but it is not yet proved: yea (though that be more then my
task requires: Agenti incumlit probatio. Martian. in Dig. lib. 22. tit. 3.
log. 21. and 23.
he that says it should make it good) it may thus be disproued.

First if in every Lot there be necessarily an immediate work and providence
of God, then is it in the natural power of man to make God work immediately
at his pleasure: for it is in man's power naturally to cast Lots at his
pleasure. But to say that it is in man's power naturally to set God on working
immediately at his pleasure, is absurd. There is not therefore an immediate
work and providence necessarily in every Lot.

Again who sees it not that the lighting of Lots in this or that manner
ordinarily comes immediately from the act of the Creature? For example: In
the blending of scrols or tickets together, the motion of the vessel wherein
they are blended (no regard had to the end for which it is done) causes some
to ly this way and some to ly that way, (every new shaking thereof causing a
new sorting) and so some to ly higher and nearer at hand, if a man will draw of
the next, some lower and further of, not likely to be drawn so soon, unless
he diue deeper. Neither can any man say certainly that there is ordinarily any
special hand of God, in the shuffling and sorting of them, crossing the course
of nature, or the natural motion of the creature, and so causing those to ly
higher and so nearer at hand, that would otherwise have lien lower, and those
to ly lower and so further from hand that would otherwise have lien higher. So
in the shuffling of Cards, the hand of him that shuffleth them is it that
disposes them, and that diversely as he lists either to stay or to continue
that act of his. In the casting of dice the violence of the Caster causes the
Creature cast to move, till either that force failing, or some opposite body
hindering it, it cease to move further, and so determine the chance.

Yea suppose two agree to decide a doubt by the cards, as they come where they
ly (left by those that last used them) without further ado; the position of
them now in that sort that they find them, is caused by him that so left them,
either at all adventures, or (as it may well be) on some special occasion
otherwise, and yet is it casual and a Lot to them.

Or lastly to instance in one other sort of Lots more commonly used by children
in game; when they play at Even and od, or at Heads and points, either there is
no such immediate providence, as these men dream of; or if there be, it must
be exercised not in disposing of any corporal motion of the insensible
Creature (for the Lots are already disposed, be they stones or pins, by him
that holds them) nor in directing the others hand in choosing, or in placing
of his pin (for (...). Dion. Chrysostom. orat. 26.
his own will led by guess and conjecture does that) but in enclining the
will of the child, or guiding his conjecture; which how senseless it is to
say, let any reasonable man judge. And the like may be said of those serious
Lots, Altari chartulis duabus imp^sitis, puerum miserunt, qui alteram
assumeret. Gu^l. Tyr. bell. sacr. l. 12 c. 24.
wherein a child is employed to choose and take up what he lists and best
likes, and by his choice is the controversy or question decided: As also Sic
captis Hierosolymis decretu^ v^ candidatis 4. calic^s 4. proponerentur, vt qui
cum elegisset in quo ho^tia contineretur, is imperium obtineret. Nic^t. in
annal.
wherein the parties themselves choose each one for himself of the Lots openly
exhibited, but distinguished by some difference to them secret and unseen.

Yea but East. hist. Gosp. reas 1.
Hierome says that a Lot is divine predestination: and who dare daly then with
it?

Where Hierome says so, I find not. I find only Hieron. in Ion. ^.1.
where he says (cited Cap. 2. 3.
before) that there was a secret hand of God directing the Lot that lighted on
Jonas: but Non statim debemus sub hoc exemp^o sortibus credere: cum priuilegia
singul^ru^ non possint legem facere communem. Hieron. ib.
he adds withal, that no general rule can be gathered for ordinary Lots
from it. But Augustine yet says Zanchie, Aug. ait praedestinationem etiam
posse appellari sortem. Sic Virgil. Aen 6. -- Hic exitus illum Sort tulit.
Zanch. de sort.
says that Predestination may be termed a Lot. True it is that Augustine
indeed says somewhat to that effect Cap. 4.. 14.
formerly likewise alleged, to wit, Sorts dixit gr^tiam qua saluati sumus,
etc. Aug. in Psalm. 30. conc. 2.
that Gods saving Grace is called a Lot: because In sort n^n est ele^tio, sed
voluntas Dei. Ibid.
in the same there is no choice but Gods will alone, and so our salvation
depends on Gods free-fauour and good pleasure only, not on man's merit. But
that is but a tropicall or metaphorical speech, comparing the freeness of
Gods choice to the indifferency of a Lot, that has no respect to any matter
of men's worth or desert: and so no way concerns the present business,
neither is it of force to prove a Lot to be that that is figuratively compared
thereunto.

Again it may be granted that a Lot cast by Gods special appointment for this
end to discover what person God has assigned to some place, may in some sense
(though very improperly) be termed Gods predestination, because it is a sign
of it, or a means to discover it, as Tria illa (praeceptum, prohibi^io,
consilium) idio dicuntur Dei voluntas, quia sunt signa voluntatis diuinae.
Lomb. sent. lib. 1. did. 45. K and Tho. sum. par. 1. q. 19. a. 11, 12.
Gods will is put not vnusually for the Signs of his will. But that also were
nothing to the Lots that we now entreat of: since there is no sound reasoning
from extraordinary to ordinary actions. And so much for the first form.

5. Secondly, from the same grounds they reason on this wise, Balmford. dial^g.
argum. 1.
Whatsoever directly, or of it self, or in a special manner tends to the
advancing of Gods name is to be used religiously Mala. 1.6, 7.
, and not to be used in sport; as we may not pray or swear in sport: Exodus
20.7. Esai 29.^3. Ierem. 4.2.
But the use of Lots directly, or of it self and in special manner tends to
the advancing of the name of God in attributing to his special Providence in
the whole and immediate disposing of the Lot, and expecting the event Prou.
^6.33. Act. 1.24, 26.
.

Therefore the Use of Lots is not to be in sports.

I answer: The assumption is not true if it be understood universally: it
concludes nothing to the Question if it be taken particularly.

The proof annexed to it scarce carries good sense: the Printer, it may be,
is in fault. But if the meaning of the Author be, as I conceive it, (for I
must in part go by guess) that the disposition of every Lot is wholly
attributed to, and the event wholly expected from the special and immediate
Providence of God; I deny it, neither do the places produced prove it. The
Prou. 16.33.
former of them, concerning ordinary Lots or Lots in general, was examined and
answered sufficiently before.

The Act. 1.24, 26.
latter is an example of an extraordinary Lot, wherein there was indeed an
immediate and special providence. But Vise Hieron sup. 4. Sic and Greg in
Ezech. homil. 2. Ali^^ est quod de doct^i ae vs^ atque discip^ina dicimus,
aliud qu^d de miraculo scimus.
extraordinary examples make no general rules. Neither is it a good course of
arguing to reason from the special, or a singular to the general and
universal; much less from one extraordinary act or event to all ordinary
courses of the same kind. Herein is the difference between the one and the
other, between the extraordinary Lot, wherein there is an immediate hand of
God for special purpose, and the ordinary Lot, wherein there is not; that the
one could not but fall certainly, were it never so often cast, as in the Lots
used for the discovery of I^sh 7.16, 17, 18.
Achan and Ion 17.
Jonas, and in the election of 1. Sam. 10 20.21.
Saul and Act 1.23, 24, 25, 26.
Matthias, and the like: whereas the other cast often in the same case, as for
partition of goods and chatels descending by inheritance upon, or bought in
common by diverse would not constantly and certainly fall out still the same.
And thus much for the two first forms; which in effect are the same.

6. Thus then they reasoned against a Lot in game as an abusing of Gods name
and a playing with a work of his immediate providence: Now further they charge
it as a tempting of God in requiring of a special work and immediate sentence
from God for the deciding of vain doubts: And first they argue on this manner:
Balmford. dialog. argum. 2.
We are not to tempt the almighty by a vain desire of manifestation of his
power and special providence.

But by using Lots in sport we do so: therefore we may not use Lots in sport.



The assumption they seem to prove on this wise.

Dan. de lud. al. c. 9. rat. 1.
To call God to sit in judgment where there is no necessity so to do, or for
the determining of trifles, is to tempt, nay to mock God:

But by the use of Lots in sport God is called to sit Tanquam reigerendae
extraordinarius moderator and arbiter. Dan. ibid.
in judgment where there is no necessity, for the determining of trifles.

By the use of Lots in sport therefore we tempt and dishonor God.

The Proposition is confirmed a simili, Eastie h^stor. of Gosp. reas. 5.
by the King and Council, by whose government though we all live, yet were it
a dishonor to them to be called upon by children to determine their sports.

The Assumption is proved a pari, by comparing together a Lot and an Oath:
B^^mford. dialog. ground 3.
A Lot in the nature thereof does as necessarily suppose the providence and
determining presence of God, as an Oath in the nature thereof does suppose the
testifying presence of God. Ba^mf. ibid. and Z^nch. in misce^^. ^r. de sort.
Etian si actu no^anuoc^s, tamen r^ipsa D^um inuo^as sortibus.
Yea so, that as in an Oath, so in a Lot, 1. Sam. 14.41.
Prayer is expressed or to be understood. In which regard also as an Oath, so a
Perkins Cas. of Consc. l. 3. c. 4. 4 q. 2.
Lot is an Res sacra. Dan. lud. al. c. 9. rat. 1. religiosa. Iun. in Ion. c. 1.
act of religion, in which we refer unto God the determining of such weighty
things as can no other ways be determined: and therefore Perkins ibid.
in the use of it is ever infolded, and sometime also expressed, both a
confession that God is a sovereign Judge to determine such things, and Act.
1.24, 25, 26.
a supplication to him that by the Lot, when it is cast, he will be pleased so
to do. A Lot, therefore, as an Oath, is not to be used but Vise sup. cap 5.. 2.
in case of necessity and extremity: and Perkins ibid.
being a solemn act of religion may not be applied to sporting: Eastie
history of Gosp. reas. 6.
We may as well jest with the Word, and Sacraments, and Oaths, as with Lots.

There might be diverse several arguments framed out of these allegations; but
because they build all on one ground, and stand upon one botome, I have thought
best to put them in this manner together that the same common answer might
serve them all.

7. First therefore the using of Lots either in matters sage and serious, or of
sport and delight is In Iudo taxillator^o ^udicium diuinum non requiritur, sed
fortune res co^mittitur. Them de sortib. c. 5. and Lyra in Prou. c. 16.
not of it self any desire of the manifestation of Gods special power and
providence by an immediate disposition, unless men offend against the caution
before given in doing it to this end, to try thereby whether God will vouchsafe
to work immediately and extraordinarily or no; which being not of the nature
of the thing it self, is not necessarily implied in the ordinary use of it. h
Neither is there any such calling in of God to decide doubts in game, but
Iudice fortuna cadat al^a. Petron. satyr. Fortuna sit opti^nis iudex, and sort
dirimatur. Justin. instit. l. 2. tit. 20.
the matter in question is put to the casual disposition of the Creature; no
more then there was any solemn calling of God in, or calling upon him to
determine the tithe, in the example before alleged out of Leuit. 27.37.
the Law. And therefore consequently Non est periculum ne Deum t^ntare
videamur. Martyr in 1. Sam. c 10.
no such tempting of God, as is here charged, in the use of a Lot, be it used
either in case of necessity or otherwise.

Yea rather if a Lot be such as here they say, it is not to be used in any
business at all upon any occasion whatsoever. For, It is Deuteronomy. 6.16. Matthew 47.
not lawful to tempt God Praecepta negatiua ligant semper and ad s^mper.
Gerson. reg. moral.
in any case whatsoever: But to use Lots in any case whatsoever is to tempt
God: It is not lawful therefore to use Lots in any case whatsoever.

The assumption is thus proved evidently Ex concessis.
by the former grounds and grants: Exodus 17.2.7. Psalm. 78.18.19.20.
To require a work of Gods immediate power and providence in this or that
kind, is to stint, and so to tempt God: But to use a Lot in any case, is to
require a work of Gods immediate power and providence: (for every Lot, say
they, is such:) Therefore to use a Lot in any case whatsoever is unlawful.

But this Conclusion is untrue: for Prou. 18.18.
a Lot in some cases may lawfully be used: the former ground therefore is false.

It is indeed No^ permittit nos D^us voluntatem suam per media extraordinaria
inuestigare. Del^io disq. mag. tom 2. l. 4. c. 4. q. 5. 2.
unlawful and a tempting of God to use a Lot so as they would have it used
only, to wit, requiring and expecting an extraordinary work of God in it, in
any case or upon any occasion whatsoever, without Gods express appointment of
it, though all means should fail otherwise. For to have recourse to
extraordinary means when ordinary fail, is to tempt God by refusing to depend
and wait upon God, as our Savior implies, when Matthew. 4.3, 4, 2.
at the Devils motion he refused to (...), etc. si^ut (...) 1. Reg. 2.17. male
vulgo exponunt, Iube, impera, etc.
speak to his Father to have stones turned into bread, least by so doing he
should tempt God, though it were in case of extremity: that which was Exodus
17.2.3. Psalm. 78.41.
the sin of the Israelites sometime in the Wilderness. No such Lot therefore
at all as they allow of is allowable. And to speak as the truth is, by the
course and force of this their discourse, the only lawful use of a Lot is
disallowed and condemned, and an unlawful and unwarrantable use of it is
allowed in the room of it.

. 8. Secondly, an Oath and a Lot are not alike: the comparison therefore laid
between them will not hold. For neither is the right of ought in an ordinary
Lot put to the special providence or immediate and extraordinary work of God;
as 2. Cor. 11.31. Galat. 1.20. Phil. 1.8.
the truth of the thing testified is in an oath put to his testimony: neither
is there in every Lot any such solemn invocation of God, as there is in an
Oath ever either 2. Cor. 1.23.
expressed or implied, by which God is called to witness with us the truth of
that we auow, or the truth of our purpose to perform what we promise: 1. Sam.
14.41. Act 1.24, 25, 26.
as may hereby appear.

The definition of each thing contains the whole nature or the thing defined.
Now a Lot may be defined without this: but so cannot an Oath. Yea so Ba^mf.
dialog.
some of the adverse party define Lotterie out of Lyra in Pr c. 16
Lyra, To use Lots is by a variable event of some sensible thing to determine
some doubtful or uncertain matter. Which definition of Lotterie contains no
such matter as is here supposed to be of the very nature and essence of a Lot,
as it is of the essence of an Oath; which cannot be defined therefore without
it.

Neither do the places produced prove it. They prove only that Prayer was
sometime used (but Precatur, sed pr^rsus absque omni fide. Mar^yr in Sam. c. 14.
a faithless prayer 1 Samuel 14.41.
the one of them without word or warrant) before an extraordinary Lot for an
extraordinary power and providence to direct the event of it; Act. 1.24.
the thing intended being such as the Lot by no natural power, either of the
Creature using it, or used in it was able to effect: which kind of prayer has
no place, nor is lawful in ordinary or mere diuisory Lots. For example:
Leuit. 27.32.
In assigning and setting out tithe, it was not lawful, much less necessary,
to pray God so to give a right Lot, that every Lamb or Kid that were indeed in
course of time the tenth, might certainly or constantly so come to hand. But
they prove not that prayer is part of a Lot or is in the Lot, as it is part of
an oath, and is included in the Oath, as by the usual Hoc est Iurare, Deum
testari. Aug. in Psalm. 109 Deum teste^ adhibere. Cic. Offic. l. 3. Quid est
iurare, nisi ius veritatis Deo reddere. Aug. de verb. Ap. sermon. 28. Iurare est
teste^ adhibere Deum. Lo^b. sent. l. 3. d. 29. F. Deum in t^st^m vocare. Thom
sum. par. 2a 2 a. q. 89. a. 1, 4. and q. 98 a. 2. implo^are testimoniu^ Dei

sermonis nostri confirmandam. Calu. Instit. l. 2. c. 8.. 23 inuocatio Dei qua
petimus vt Deus fit testis de animo nostro quod fallere nolimus, and vt vinde^
sit si fesellerimus Melanch loc. com. in definit. Iuratio itaque ad
inuocatione^ ^ertinet. Ibid. de 2o praecept.
definitions of an Oath may appear. In election of offices sacred or civil
prayer is used or at least ought to be used: yet it follows not therefore
that prayer is a part of the choice, or that therefore the election in the
nature of it does necessarily suppose a special providence and determining
presence of God. Yea prayer may be used both before game and in game, as both
before and at meat, and yet is not therefore of the nature of game, nor
supposes therefore a special providence of God and a determining presence in
it.

Lastly, a Lot is no religious act, nor holy thing of it self, as Chap 6.. 6.
before has been shown: there is much difference therefore between Lots,
and the word of God, Sacraments and Oaths. For these things are holy of
themselves and in their own nature, as the very definitions of them will soon
show: and therefore cannot but be holy. Whereas a Lot is not in the nature and
the definition of it holy, and therefore is not always and necessarily sacred.
Yea those things are now holy, as ever, in our ordinary use; whereas no Lot is
holy that we can use now adays; nor indeed was ever any so, save
extraordinarily. But Gods taking of any thing sometime extraordinarily or from
ordinary use to apply it to some holy and extraordinary use, does not exempt
the kind in general, but the thing only it self so used in special from
civil or light and ordinary usage; and that also so long only as it is so set
apart: As the use of water in Baptism hinders not but that a man may play
with water, yea and with that very water that may afterward be a Sacrament in
Baptism, or that has so been, but is not now. In like manner when a Lot
shall be extraordinarily used for a special sign of Gods immediate election
and choice, whosoever shall then contemn or set light by that Lot, he shall
abuse an holy thing and Gods name in so doing; but not whosoever shall use
otherwise any Lot to disport, yea though it were that Lot that had been used
in such a business before; there remaining no more holiness in it after that
use is over, then in Exodus 3.2.5.
the bush that burnt but wasted not, when God manifested himself to Moses in
it, after that manifestation was once ended.

9. Again they argue hence on this wise:

Fennor of recreat. spec. rule 4. reas. 4.
Gods Oracles (being his name) may not be used for recreation:

But Lots are Gods Oracles. Lots therefore may not be used for recreation or in
disport.

The assumption is thus proved: Cartwr^n Prou. c. 16. Quod s^rt^m appellat
iudicium, etc.
In that Solomon calls a Lot judgment, where he says; Prou. 16.33.
The judgment of it is of God: he shows that Pers^rte^ Deus ipse in iudicio
sed^at.
God himself sits in judgment by it, and that Sortem esse Dei mund^ Iudieu

the Lot is as Gods Deputy who is Judge of the world, whereby he himself
determines of things doubtful, and such as no art or wit of man is able to
discover.

Yea not only Fennor vbi supr.
the Scripture makes a Lot so the sentence of God, as in the most weighty
matters of God and man, Act. 1.24.26. Number. 26.55. Leuit. 16.8.

it is the very oracle and determination of Gods will, wherein a man must rest
without any contradiction or motion to the contrary: but even Ion. 1.7.
the very Gentiles themselves also knew it to be Gods Oracle.

These proofs of the Assumption are unsound and insufficient. For first for

the learned well observe. Yet neither is a Lot there termed Judgment; though
the word that naturally so signifies be applied there unto it, and might be
properly used of some special kind of it: Neither does the word in the
ordinary use of it only so signify, but is used more generally for any
custom, or manner, or course, or carriage whatsoever, be it light or weighty,
just or unjust; as where it is used of the profane and proposterous carriage ^

of Baals Priests toward themselves: and in this general manner the best and
most Interpreters there take it. Fortuna sit index sort adhibita. Cod. li. 6.
tit. 43. l. 3.
The word therefore there used is too weak a ground to bear a frame of such
weight as is here built upon it. For as for Gods immediate sitting and
sentencing in Lots, (of which further anon) the conceit of it breeds a
superstitious use of them; (the rather therefore to be abhorred:) Tota racio
eius. Ium. and Mer^er. disposition, or disposing, Augl.
from some taint whereof that speech of Cartwr. in Prou. c. 18.
the same Author cannot be freed where he says, that Valet ad verum
reconditissamarum peru^stigatio^e^.
Lots are available for the finding out of the most hidden things, as they
have been used often to that end: as also that Derebus d^bijs null h^minu^ art

Et ips^ Sera^. ib. q 20. V^tita sunt sorts quibus incrimina inquiritur.
by them such doubtful things may be determined, as no wit or skill of man is
otherwise able to decide. For what hidden truth can by any Lot be discovered?
or what can be decided or determined by a Lot, that might not be determined by
any third party, yea by a child or Idiote, as well as by a Lot, if it should
please the parties contending to refer themselves thereunto?

10. Secondly for the instances alleged: To reason on this manner, Lots were
once Gods Oracles in these and these cases: therefore they are so in all: or,
Lots were sometime extraordinarily Gods Oracles in some cases whereunto they
were by God then specially for that purpose assigned: therefore they are so
always: both the consequence is unsound, and the consequent untrue. For first
it follows not; If sometime extraordinarily, then ever. 2. Sam. 5.24.25.
The noise that David heard over his head in the mulbery-trees was Gods Oracle
to him: shall the like rustling, that we may chance to hear in trees over
our heads, be therefore a divine Oracle to us? 1. Sa. 14.8, 9, 10.
The Philistines speech to Jonathan and his Armor-bearer was as an Oracle of
God to them: shall the like answer therefore be the same now to us? or must it
needs therefore be ever such?

Again that Lots are not always, nay not at all now Gods Oracles or any such
divine sentence, it is evident.

For first Number. 23.19.20. 1. Sam. 15.29. Esai 14.27.
Gods Oracles and sentences are certain and constant: for Psalm 33.11. and
111.78. Matthew. 5.18 2 C^r. 1.18.19.20.
his word and sentence is yea and amen as M^lac. 3.6. I^ma. 17. Psalm 65.15.
Deus Amen.
himself. And so were those Lots whereby God sometime gave sentence, as that
which Achan was discovered by, which had it therefore either been often cast, or
cast by diverse persons at Gods appointment at once, would still constantly have
Josh 7.16.17.18. Certissima est cognitio quaeper sorts a Deo temperatas
habetur. Zanch. de sort.
lighted on no Tribe but Iud^, no kindred but the Zarchites, no household but
Zabdies, no person but Achan. But then an ordinary Lot (...). Philo de constit.
princip. Sor^res est incertissima. Bar^ in I^u. c. 1.
there is nothing more uncertain, ready upon every new shaking of the Lot pot
to give out a new sentence. For suppose we that some one Minister of a whole
hundred in our head City should by Lot be selected to visit the Pesthouse,
would the Lot drawn in this case As in the Tuscan Estate they draw five
several times, and so five several persons for each office. See before chap 4
sect. 8.
four or five times together with never so great solemnity light certainly
and constantly ever on the same man? Or suppose As in the Venetian Estate,
four several companies cast Lots for the nomination of the same Offices. Ibid.
four or five several Companies in several places should, after the business
solemnly by prayer commended to God, cast Lots upon the selfsame employment
among the same parties, were it certain, yea or probable that they should all
light upon the same person? Or were it not triuolous, if not impious, therefore
to say, that upon every second shaking or drawing GOD altreth his sentence, and
so to accuse him of inconstancy; or that to several Companies he gives a
several sentence, and so to charge him with contradiction and contrariety?

Secondly Deuteronomy. 32.4. 2. Chron. 9.7. Ps 92.15. and 111. 7.8. and 19.8.9.
Gods oracles are ever according to justice and equity: but the sentence of a
Lot is not certainly such. For suppose a matter of right, wherein he that
ought to yield will not yield, by mutual consent therefore of necessity put
to a Lot; dare any man say certainly that it shall go with him that has
right? Or in war, suppose a whole troop put to cast Lots for their lines,
among whom there are many that are no way at all faulty, dare any say that the
Death-lot shall light on no one of these, but upon those alone that indeed have
deserved to die? as I^sh 7.18.19.
in Achans case a man might well confidently say, that it should surely light
on him that was the delinquent and on no other, whom by such means God had
then given warrant to search for. No: Fieri potest vt innocentem dam^et sors.
Serar. in I^sh. c. 7. q. 20.
a Lot regards no more right then wrong, Ex fuso exercitu cum decimus quisque
fuste feritur, etiam ^renni sortiuntur. Tacit. annal. lib. 14.
no more guiltless then guilty, ready to go indifferently for or against
either. It is none therefore of Gods sentence.

Thirdly, if a Lot were Gods sentence, (...). vt Aristid. de Rhet^r. ad Plat.
what need men be so curious in examining and trying the fitness or unfitness
of those that they admit to a Lot for the bearing of any Office either in
Church or Commonweal? (For I spare to ask of the Popish sort, why they
therefore forbear to elect Ecclesiastical Officers by Lot, if a Lot be Gods
sentence; because such things, say they, must be done by the inspiration of
Gods spirit^; Honor. 3. in Decretal. l. 5. tit. 21. c. 3. and Thom. de sort. c.
5.
as if Gods spirit and his sentence were not sure to concur.) For is not Deus
melius in huiusmodi indicat. Aug. ep. 180.
God as well able to judge of their fitness or unfitness as man is? Or do
they distrust God, and fear that he will be partial in his sentence, whose
constant commendation is, that he is Deuteronomy. 10.17. 2 Chronicles. 197. Job 34 19. Act.
10.34. Romans 2.10.
no respecter of persons? The general care therefore in this kind of all
those that use Lots in any such weighty affair, shows evidently, that they
do not esteem the Lots verdict Gods Oracle, but a sentence so uncertain, so
inconsiderate, so heedlesse, that it might well run with them into a
whirle-poole drawing Church and State after it, if by humane caution it were
not the more warily managed. Was there any such fear, think we, in the Lot
that 1 Samuel 10.21.
Samuel cast for a King; or any need of such caution to have been observed in
it?

. 11. Lastly, it a Lot were a divine sentence, Quibus in r^bus ad Deum
consulendum ventum est, omnino stari indicio eius oportet. Iun. in Ion. c. 1.
it were unalterable and unchangeable, such as men were ever bound to rest in
and abide by, under danger of sin and disobedience, without further
inquisition, consultation, consideration, or forecasting ought for the worse or
the better. Est. 1.19. and 8.8 Dan 6.8, 12. Gal. 3.15 Etiam ab hominibus
iudicata pro veritate haberi solent Iun. ib. Sententia, si^^res iudicata pro
veritate accipitur. ^lpian in Digest. lib. 1. tit. 5. leg 25. P^st re^iudicata^
nihil quaeritur. Ide^ ex Marci Imper. sententia, l. 42. ^. 1. le. 56. quia res
certa iam habetur. Accurs. Gloss.
Man's sentence is sometime held such: Gods ever much more. Yea so it was in
those Lots, wherein God extraordinarily gave sentence, as in 1 Samuel 10 ^1.
Saul's and Act. 1.25, 26.
Matthias his: whereas in ordinary Lots it is far otherwise.

For first in private affairs no man is bound to stand to the event of a Lot
which he never gave consent unto. In private affairs I say, because Ad tertij
alicuius petitione^ cuius interest, iubere potest contendentes sorti rem
o^^i^tere ^ vel ad alterius petitionem, ^ dissidentium tantum intersit, alteram
c^get. Greg. Toloss. syntag^. l. 34. c. 5.
in some cases the Law enableth the Magistrate to compel the parties
contending, will they nill they, to bide by it; which yet Iudiciu^ sortis locum
non habet nisi in casibus a iure expressis Bartol. apud Gom^z ad leg. Taur leg.
38.
he is not permitted to do in more cases, then in the letter of the Law are
expressed. It were an idle thing, for a young man to tell his Parents that of
two Maidens motioned to him for marriage such a one of the twain which they
like not of, yet they ought to give their consent with (it is a Bucer. in oper.
Augl disput. cu^ Iung^.
learned man's instance, and that approved by him, of a Noble man's son)
because having cast Lots for direction after invocation of Gods name in that
business, the Lot had light upon her. Much more idle yet were it for him to
bear one down, that she ought in conscience to have him and no other but him,
and that without guilt of sin and disobedience she might not refuse him,
because God in a Lot cast by him had given such a sentence. And yet were a Lot
Gods oracle, it should necessarily bind, not expecting man's priuity or consent
thereunto: yea where it was Gods oracle, it did necessarily so bind, as 1.
Sam. 10.22.
in Saul's case nothing willing at the first, but enforced in some sort to
condescend unto that which the Lot imposed upon him.

Secondly by mutual consent it is no question but that men may alter and
change their Lots either with other, as Inter ipsos Consules permutatio
prouinciaru^ facta est. Liu. l 26. anno 544.
Leuinus and Marcellus sometime did at the request of the Senate upon suite
made by the Sicilians whom Marcellus, one they sorely feared, was else to have
had. But may any by mutual agreement alter Gods sentence, as Prou. 2.17.
Matthew. 19.6.
the wife to leave her head and break the covenant of her God, co^uencrat
olim, Vt tu quod velles, faceres; nec non ego possem Indulg^ra mihi.-Iunen.
sat. 6.
because her Husband is content to agree thereunto? Or to hold to a Lot where
it was a divine Oracle, might 1. Sa. 10.21, 22.
Saul so elected have surrendered his right to another, though the people should
have benne willing also to have yielded thereunto? Or might Matthias have
resigned his place to Barsabas, and Barsabas by joint consent have taken it of
him? Yet if in choice of a Minister for the Pesthouse, should the Lot light on
one that (as Proch^r. histor. Joan. c. 1.
Prochorus the Counterfeit fableth of John when he saw that by Lot he was to
go over sea into Asia) should for fear presently sink down in a sownd, and
some other more hardy then he offer himself voluntarily to that office, were
it not lawful to accept of him? or were it wisdom to refuse him, and press
the other to it so unfit for it?

Yea lastly in some case it were a sin for a man to retain that which by Lot
is befalne him. For may a man with a good conscience keep his brothers right
from him, which the iniquity of a Lot, for quietness sake yielded to by the
other, has against justice cast upon him, and say it is Gods sentence? yea may
not the wronged party lawfully endeavor, by conuincing him in conscience of
the wrong that he has done him, to recover his right, if he can? Or as Act.
1.25.26.
Matthias should have sinned in renouncing his Apostleship; so did not Joseph
captiu. l 4 c 12.
Phannias that sely Idiote as well sin in accepting of the High-preistship,
though assigned him by Lot? And yet by these men's positions should that Lot
also be Gods sentence, and his choice thereby Gods immediate call to that
office. A senseless conceit to suppose that any man should sin by following
Gods call, by doing after Gods sentence.

12. Where it is to be observed, that howsoever it is here pretended that the
very Heathen held their Loteries ever to be most religious and inviolable; yet
in truth it is not so? Vise cap. 4. 7.
They esteemed it indeed a very prudent and politic ordinance for the
preventing of diverse inconveniences; yea Vise quae ibid. Huc per i^cum allusit
Cic. Phil. 3. Prae^lara fu^t Se^atus in ill^ di^ religiosae prouinciaerum

in some sort too religious, as in their public affairs it was ordered, in
regard Hinc sortitio vitiosa, in qua ^itus illi parum rite obseruati. Liu. l.

of some superstitious rites used about it, as Nihil fero quondam maioris rei

about all other their solemn, yet civil employments either public or
private: And Vise qua sup. cap. 4.. 7.
in that regard held they it an heinous offense for any private man to alter
the course of any business which the state thereby had established.

But yet they reputed not the Lot to be so sacred and peremptory a sentence,
but that they might reject those that it had lighted upon, if they either Corn.

when after the Lots cast, upon better advice, they misdoubted that it might
prove any way prejudicial to the public, if the course were not altered.

In which kind they are, as deservedly to be approved and commended; so to be
preferred before the superstitious Jews, who Ex Joseph. capti^. l. 6. c. 8.

rather then they would break the order of the Priestly employment in set
courses at first settled by Lot, suffered the service of God for some space of
time in the siege of their City to be wholly neglected, because all the
Priests of that course then present there were utterly destroyed, that ought at
that time to have done the service.

True it is indeed that in the Civil Law A iudicio sort is appellari no^

all Appeal is denied ordinarily from the sentence of a Lot: But that is, not

mundo superiorem non habet. Jason. Bald. Bart. Decius Rebuff. and alij apud
Sca^ch. de appell. q. 16. limit. 6.
because the sentence of a Lot is the sentence of Fortune, or of God, who has
no superior in this world^ but rather, as others, with better color of
reason; because Quia facilioris iudicij and actus causa ita placuit. Gregor.
Tolos. de appell. l. 2. c. 16.
this course is taken for more speedy dispatch; because Alioqui se mutuo

by flying from it in diverse cases they shall but hinder either other from ever

in which case their own act justly concludes either side: (...). Plato de

from those Judges that the parties themselves have made choice of by mutual
consent; As also (...) a quibus appellare licebat ad Indices: (...), a quorum

Demosth. in Midiam.
from such as by mutual agreement they had referred themselves unto, it is
apparent that they could have no appeal.

Let me add one thing further that in some cases at the civil Law, though no
remedy ordinarily be granted in a division by Lot made with some inequality,
because Qui sentit damnum, sensisset lucrum, si, quod p^tuit, ei sors fa^isset.
Sigism. Sca^^h. de appell. quaest. 16. l^mit. 6.
the hazard of lighting upon the less part and so of sustaining the loss was
alike unto either; yet it is the opinion of good Lawyers, that Non procedit
limita^i^, si ad sse^ enormis l^sio, etc. Idem ibid. A sort itaque qua^d^que
appellatur. Ibid.
if the inequality be ouer-great, the Magistrate may lawfully interpose his
authority for the redressing of the wrong.

To draw all to an head then and so to end with this argument, let any man
endued with ordinary reason judge how a Lot can be said to be a sacred Oracle,
and a divine sentence, that neither absolutely tieth any man for matter of
fact, nor does certainly determine ought in question of right, that never
speaks certainly, and would often speak unadvisedly, if by humane caution it
were not limited before what it should say.

13. Now these were the arguments taken from the nature of Lots. The next
argument is drawn from the proper use and end of them. And herein they reason
sometime from the affirmative, sometime from the negative.

From the affirmative thus: Balmsor dialog. argum. 3.
Whatsoever God has sanctified to a proper end, is not to be perverted to a
worse end Matthew. 21.12, 13.
.

But God has sanctified Lots to a proper end; viz. to end controversies Number.
26.55. Trou. 18.18.
.

Therefore man is not to pervert them to a worse; viz. to play, and by playing
to get away another men's money, which without controversy is his own.



This argument thus conceived is faulty two ways. For first it goes from the
question, which is not whether any Creature or ordinance of God may be
perverted, or peruersly used; but whether the use of Lots questioned be a
perverting of them or no; whereas in the conclusion it is taken for granted
that it is. Neither again is the question whether men may use Lots playing for
money (a thing incident to other games as well as these; which whether it be
lawful or no, I shall not need now to discuss.) much less, whether they may
be used in game to that end, to get another man's money from him, or no; (which
is no general use of them, nor has any place at all there, where either there
is no wagering at all, or where the Lot is used only at the beginning of the
game, to decide who shall join, who lead, or the like:) but whether Lots may
in any wise be used in sport.

Secondly there is more inferred in the conclusion then was in the premises,
and that which follows not from ought in them. For the use of a Lot in play
is ever to decide some question or controversy, though a light one it is like,
yet a question or controversy truly so termed; otherwise it were no Lot.

For the mending of these faults the argument may better be conceived on this
manner: That which God has sanctified to some proper use, is not to be applied
to any other, especially a worse use.

But Their proper use is to decide great controversies Perkins gold. chain,
chap. 20. on precep. 3.
God has sanctified Lots to this proper use, to wit, the deciding of
controversies in matters of weight.

A Lot therefore may not be applied to any other use, much less to a worse.



The Proposition is proved by Matthew. 21.12, 13. ex Esai 56.7. and I^r. 7.11.
an instance of the Temple, set apart for prayer, which the Jews therefore are
reproved for applying to market and merchandise.

The Assumption is confirmed principally by that saying of Solomon, Prou. 18.18.
The Lot stinteth strife, and makes partition among the mighty. For Number. 26.55.
the other place is but an instance that a Lot once was by Gods own
appointment so used. It is amplified a simili, The proper end of a Lot, as of
an Oath, is to end a controversy. Balmford. dial. ground 2.
by the like use of an Oath: concerning which there is a further speech of the
Apostle brought Fenner of recreat. spec. rule 4. reas 1.
to prove that Salomons purpose in those words before alleged is to show the
only lawful use of a Lot; (viz. to end controversies which otherwise
conveniently cannot, when each Contender without the Lot is too mighty to
yield;) thus: Fennor ibid.
As when the Apostle says, Hebr. 6.16.
An Oath for confirmation among men is an end of all strife, his purpose is not
so much to teach us, that men use an Oath to end controversies; (which every
man knows,) but that God has dedicated and made an Oath holy and sure only
for that use of necessary deciding of doubts of importance among men: so the
like words used of a Lot must be understood in the same sense* not so much to
teach us that a Lot ended such controversies among men, which all know, but
that God has ordained it only for that use.

14. For the fuller answer to this argument and the proofs of it, diverse
distinctions, of some good use, would be observed.

First therefore the word, sanctify, is diversely taken. For, to omit all other
acceptions; it is taken sometime in a larger sense; and so to sanctify
signifies to assign a creature to any special or singular use whatsoever,
either sacred or civil: thus are Esai 13.3.
the Medians said by God to be sanctified for the subduing and sacking of
Babel: and so are 1. Tim. 4.4.
meats said to be sanctified by Gods word for man's food; and 1. Cor. 7.14.
the unbelieving Mate sanctified to the married believer.

Sometime again it is taken in a stricter sense; and so to sanctify
signifies to set apart a Creature beside his ordinary use to some sacred and
spiritual employment: as where it is said, that Genesis 2.3.
God sanctified the seventh day of the world; and where Exodus 20.8.
men are commanded to sanctify the same: he by precept enioyning that
employment of it; they by practice employing it according to his precept.

Now in both these kinds may the Lord well be said sometime to sanctify but
not to appropriate; when by his ordinance he either enioineth or grants the
use of a Creature so in some kind, as yet he restrains not, nor inhibiteth
the use of it in any other kind. Thus are the fruits of the earth so Genesis
1.29.
sanctified for man's food, as they are Esai 38.21.
not yet restrained from physic: yea thus was the water that Number. 20.10.11.
miraculously gushed out of the rock so 1. Cor. 10.4.
sanctified to a spiritual employment, as yet it was not denied unto civil
and profane uses, even Number. ^0.8, 11.
to the watering of brute beasts: sometime to sanctify and to appropriate,
when God sequestreth and seuereth the Creature so sanctified unto some one
special or proper use from all other uses else whatsoever.

And thus he sanctifies and appropriateth either the whole kind of the
Creature; as Exodus 30.31, 32, 33.
that curious composition of precious and holy ointment expressly inhibited to
all other uses; or some particular only of that kind; as Exodus 30.23.
the spices and odours ingredients of that holy ointment; as Exodus 30.26, 27,
28, 29. and 29.44.
the Tabernacle, 1. King. 8.10, 63, 64. and 9.3.
the Temple, and the appurtenances of either: and as those Elements of Matthew.
3.11. Ephesians. 5.25. 1. Cor. 6.11.
water, 1. Cor. 10.16.
bread and Matthew. 26.27, 28, 29.
wine that in the Sacraments are sanctified to be signs and pledges of
spiritual grace: and that again, either so to continue during the date of
that law, as in the unguent before spoken of; or during the time only of the
special use to those ends, as in the Elements last mentioned.

To apply these distinctions then to the present argument: If they take the
word sanctify in the stricter sense, the Proposition is true, but the
Assumption is unsound: for Lots are not set apart, or said so to be in either
of the Prou. 18.18. Number. 26.55.
places produced to any holy or spiritual, but to a civil use only.

If in the larger and more general sense, then either they speak of things
sanctified only but not appropriated, or of things both sanctified and
appropriated too, and that either the whole kind in general, or some of the
kind only.

If of things sanctified only but not appropriated, the Proposition is not
true; For 1. Cor. 11.23, to 28.
bread and wine are sanctified to be seals of Gods covenant, and yet does not
that hinder Psalm. 104.15.
the lawful use of them otherwise: so was oil sometime Leuit. 21.^, 10, 12.
Psalm. 89.20. and 133.2.
sanctified to anoint 1. Sam. 10.1. and 24.7. and 26.11. and 16.13.2. Sam.
2.4. et 5 3. 1. King. 1.39. 2. King. 11.12 and 23.30.
Kings and Leuit. 8.2.10.
Priests, and yet did not that then restrain Psalm. 104.15. Eccles. 9.8. Matthew.
6.17. Luke 10.34.
the civil use of it for food, physic, necessity or lawful delight. Or to
use a more familiar instance and nearer the present purpose, Genesis 1.29.
the fruits of trees are sanctified to be man's food; yet does not that let
but that children, as of old time they did, may lawfully play and make
themselves pastime as well with Da nuces pucris. C^tul. epithal. Spargae,

almonds, as with cheri-stones, or with check-stones and the like.

If of things sanctified and appropriated; as it was in that Exodus 30.31, 32,
33.
holy ointment inhibited to all other uses; and as it is in the Romans 4.11.
Exodus 12.11.
Sacraments sequestered and set apart to certain spiritual purposes only, the
Assumption is unsound.

If of the sanctification and appropriation not of the whole kind, but of some
particulars of the kind, the premises might be granted, and yet nothing
concluded against the use of Lots in general.

If of the whole kind, the Proposition is true, though the proof be not so
pertinent; but the Assumption is not sound.

For the proof of it out of Prou. 18.18.
Solomon: that place shows only Su^^ma est singula^^m esse sortis vsum in
componandis litib^^. Cartw^. in Prou. c. 18.
how a Lot may well and wisely be used; but neither enioyneth that use of it,
nor restrains it thereunto. It approves only the use as good and
commendable in that kind: But it is onething for a Lot to be used well and
wisely to that end; and another thing to have that the proper or only end of
it.

15. But Hebr. 6.16.
the Apostles speech of an Oath shows that Solomon meant so, when he used
the like speech of a Lot.

It does nothing less. For neither is it true that the Apostles scope was to
show that this is the only end of an Oath, to stint strife and controversy,
neither is it so indeed.

His purpose is not to show it: for Hebr. 6.13, 16, 17, 18.
it is only to show how sacred, firm and inviolable an Oath is among men from
man to man; (which he proves by that which all men know and acknowledge) and
how much more then from God to man, when I^rat vobis per quem iuratis. Cassiod.
Var l. 8 ep. 3.
he swears to us by whom we swear: like the Argument used by the Apostle
elsewhere, Galat. 3.15.
A man's covenant or testament once ratified no man annulleth; much less can
any annull or abrogate Gods.

Neither is that the only lawful end of an Oath. For there be other ends of
it; as, to give assurance of the performance of covenants and promises. For
what controversy was there between Jonathan and David to be ended by Oath,
when 1. Sam. 20.16, 17, 42.
they swear either to other? or what controversy was there between GOD and
Abraham, or David and GOD; when Genesis 22.16, 17. Heb. 6.13, 14, 17, 18.
God swear to Abraham, and Psalm 119.106. and 132.203.
David to God? or what controversy is there to be ended by those Oaths, that
men usually take at entrance into office both in Church and Commonweal?

The like may be said of that Prou. 18.18.
other place of Solomon. The scope of the place is not to stint or restrain
the use of a Lot to the ending of strife, much less to the ending of great
quarrels only; or among men of might alone, though Solomon expressly name such:
For he speaks of contentions in general: And why may not a mean inheritance
be divided by Lot among mean men as well as a rich one among mighty men? or
do not contentions arise among mighty men many times about mean matters? But
the scope of it is rather Vise Lauat. and Bainu^ in Prou. 18.
to persuade all sorts of men to compose their controversies, be they great or
small, rather by such a course so easy and so equal, then to plunge
themselves by eager pursuit of Law suites into further inconveniences; and
Cartwr. ibid.
to induce men of mean condition the rather so to do, when even men of might
are content often to submit themselves thereunto.

Not to ad, that Lots have been used Josh 7.14. Ion. ^.7 1. Sam. 14.42. Leuit.
16 8, 9.
often to other ends (for it is but one use among many that is there mentioned)
as both has been in part, and shall further hereafter be showed, and as Vsus
particularis sor^is litium diremptio. Valet por^o ad veri^at^m inuestiga^dam;
ad concordiam vbi prius culta est alendan^, etc. Cartwr. in Pro^. c. 18.
some of them that in this point oppose us, confess.

16. Thus they reasoned affirmatively from the proper use and end of Lots: now
further they argue thus negatiuely concerning the same.

That which there is neither precept for, nor practice of in Gods word,
general or special, express or implied, that there is no warrant for in the
word.

But such is the use of Lots in game: for ^alms dialog. ground 1.
we read not in Scripture that Lots were used but in serious matters only
both by Jews and Gentiles: Easti^ ^istor. of Gospel, ^eas. 2.
neither is there any warrant in the Word for the ludicrous use of them by
precept, or practice, general or special, express or implied.

There is no warrant therefore for lusorie Lots in Gods word: and so
consequently they are unwarrantable.

This is like Ambroses argument against merry jests; Ioca videntur dulcia and
suania, cum tamen a Christiana regula sint aliena: non euim in diuinis literis
inuenitur, quemadm^d^m ^a debeant vsurpari. Ambros. offic. l. 1. c. 23.
We read nothing of them in Scripture: therefore they are not to be allowed.
Which yet is no good kind of reasoning. The consequence of his Enthymen^, and
the Proposition likewise of their Syllogism is unfound.

For first an Argument holds indeed from the negative in matter of Faith, but
not in matter of Fact: as to say, Hebr. 1.4, 5. Quod non lego, non credo*
(...), etc. Cyril. catech 4. Sine autoritate Scripturarum garruli^a^ no^ habet
fidem. Hieron. ad Tit. c. 1. Quod de Scripturis autoritatem non habet, eadem
facilitate contemnitur qua probatur. Idem in Matt. c. 23. Sancta S^riptura
doctrina nosirae regulam figit. Aug. de bon. vid. c. 1. In his quae aperte
p^sita sunt in Scriptura, inueniuntur ^mnia illa quae continent fidem moresque
viuendi. Id^m de doctr. Christ. l 2. c. 9. Cum hoc (Euangelium) credimus, nihil
d^sideramus vltra credere: hoc enim prius credimus, non esse quod vltra credere
debeamus. Tertull. in pr^script.
such a thing is not expressed or revealed in the word, therefore it is no
matter of Faith, nor such as a man is necessarily bound to believe: but not to
say, Scriptura multa dissimulat, multa tacit praet-rit, etc. Aug. de not. and
great. contr. Pelag. c. 37. and 38. and de mend. ad Consent. c. 10.
such a thing is not mentioned or related in Scripture, therefore it was not
done, or it never was: as for example, Genesis 4.17.
Cain has but one son mentioned by Moses, therefore he had no more sons
or children but him. Much less may a man reason A facto ad ius: a non fieri ad
non licere.
from matter of Fact to matter of Right, as to say, such or such a thing we
never read in the word to have been done, and therefore it may not be done.
For how many things are there whereof there is no example in Gods word, and yet
the use of them is generally allowed as lawful and good? Many things there are
whereof no precedent of the use of them but in some one kind only, which yet
may be used also unto others. No use of butter recorded in the word but for
food only: may it not therefore be used also for physic? Yea many things
there are of ordinary use, whereof there is no mention at all in Gods word,
which yet all generally allow: as sugar for sweetning, printing of books,
shooting in guns, and the like, which all by this argument are utterly
condemned; or if they be justified, then the grounds of it fail.

Secondly an Action may have Voluntas Dei dicitur praeceptio, prohibitio,
consilium, permissio. Lomb. sent. l. 1. d. 45. G.
warrant sufficient by permission without precept or practice. For where God
has not limited the use of any Creature or ordinance, there he has left the
use of it free. Where he has not determined the circumstances of any action,
there what he has not prohibited, that has he permitted, and that is warrant
sufficient for it. Where therefore circumstances are determined, the argument
holds from the negative to make that unwarrantable, that is not either
expressly or by good consequence enjoined. But where they are not determined,
the argument is strong enough from the negative to prove that warrantable that
is not either expressly or by just consequence prohibited.

For this cause in the point of Gods worship the argument holds Ier 7.31. and
19.5 Coloss 2.22, 23.
from the negative for the substance of it, because Deuteronomy. 12.30, 31, 32.
God has determined it. But in civil affairs it will not hold from the
negative to disallow ought; because God has not so determined them. Else what
warrant is there for bowls, for tennis, for football, for chesse etc. which
yet no man disalloweth? Let one example serve for all to show the weakness of
this kind of arguing. There is neither precept, nor practice ( 1. Sam. 14.31,
to 35.
at least allowed or allowable) of eating Blood in Scripture: therefore a man
may not eat a black pudding. In which conclusion I assure my self these
Authors will not accord with the Familists and new Sectaries. And yet may they
say more against the one, then these can any of them against the other. For the
one is found expressly forbidden both in the old and new Testament both Genesis 9.4.
before the Law, Leu. 7.26, 27 and 17.10, to 15. Deuteronomy. 12.16, 23, 24, 25 and
15.23.
under the Law, and Act. 15.20, 29.
after the Law, (to omit what (...). Clem. constit. Apost. l. 6. c. 12. (...).

sundry of the Ancients have held of it) but the other no where in neither.
And if Galat. 5.1.
Christian liberty notwithstanding bought with the blood of Christ, give Gods
children a free use of the one, how much more then of the other. If Act. 10.13,
14, 15. Romans 14.14. Tit. 1.15.
it loose them there, where they were bound before; sure it binds them not
there, where they were free before.

17. There is yet one appendix behind to this argument, that would be met with
ere we leave it.

East. history of the Gospel, reas. 3.
Scripture notes wicked men to have used Lots in sport: Sporting Lots
therefore are not allowable.

Both the antecedent is untrue, and the consequence unsound. The antecedent
untrue, for it was rather a serious diuisory then a lusory Lot, that either
Psalm. 22.18.
Saul's servants used about David's apparel, or that Mark. 15.24. John 19.24.
the soldiers cast on Christ's garments: not used by them, as Procop. in Genes.
c. 28.
some have supposed, superstitiously, out of a conceit of some virtue that
they hoped to find in Christ's clothes, his seamelesse S^bucula interior.
Euthym. in Matthew. c. 67.
shirt especially, to cure diseases withal, as had Matthew. 9.20. 21. and 14.36.
and Chrysost^m. in Matthew. homil. 87. and Theiphyl. in Matthew. 27.
sometime been done, nor yet, as * others say, in despite of him done to his
garments alone, but, as Cyril. in Ican. l. 12. c. 32. and Calvin. harm. Euang.
and Maldonat. in Matthew. c. 27.
their usual custom was to divide among themselves the raiment of such as
were executed by them, (which was, it seems, as among us also it is, part of
their fees;) so did they then our Saviors, and that in this manner, partly
Baron. tom. 1. ann 34. Gualter. in Joan. c 19.
to save that that might else have been spoiled, and partly Suarez in 3. Thom.
tom. 2. disp. 38.. 1. and Gualter. ibid.
to prevent all contention and strife. Neither was that act of theirs in that
regard evil or unlawful, for ought I see, or can be said, had it been a
booty that by some lawful course had come to them, and could not otherwise
have conveniently been parted among them, each of them having an equal
interest therein. For in such case even those that condemn ludicrous Lots, yet

admit them for partition of prey and spoils taken in fight. And Admiratione

fratres germani multi, etc. Gualt. in Joan. c. 19.
some good Writers rather commend then condemn these Heathen soldiers their
modest and equal carriage in that case.

The consequence also is unsound. It is like the argument N. S.
one uses to condemn Natalitia.
birthday feasts, because we find them not used in Scripture but by two
only, and both bad ones, Gen 4 ^ 20.
Pharao an Heathen the one, and Matthew. 14.6.
Herod, no better, if not worse then an Heathen, the other. Which argument yet
will not hold; no more then to reason on this manner; Matthew. 24.38. Luke 17.16.
Wicked men plant and build, and mary and make marriages; therefore planting and
building and marying and making marriages are evil. Or, Genesis 31.55. Ruth 1.14.
wicked men have sometime kissed their friends at parting: therefore it is not
lawful for good Christians to do so. Or, to come fuller home; We read not in
the word Ezech. 27.12, 19, 22, 27.
of Marts or Faires used but among Heathen, and therefore they are not now
lawful or allowable among Christians. Or we read not of any but Genes. 40.1.
Nehem 1.11. aliud enim (...) aliud (...) Genesis 15.2 quod Hieron. non aduertit
quaest. in Genesis
profane Princes that kept Butlers or Bakers: therefore Christian Princes
ought not to have such Officers. Or, Esai. 5.12. Amos 6.4* 5, 6.
Music at civil feasts is not found used in Scripture but by wicked and
ungodly ones: therefore the use of it at such times is not allowable. Neither
therefore is that that is alleged, true; neither did it prove ought to the
present purpose, if it were true.

18. Thus have we gone through the maine and most forcible Arguments that are
produced against lusorious Lots. For these arguments only that are drawn from
the nature of Lots, or the proper end and use of them, are those that fight
against the general use of Lots in disport: the re^t concern the use of them
but in some sorts o^ game; and therefore though they were all granted, yet were
nothing concluded against the maine point propounded, to wit, that the use of a
Lot in disport or pastime is not simply evil in it self. Yet it shall not be
amiss to hear what the rest say.

The next argument therefore, and of the principal the last and the least is
taken from the other Term in the point questioned, to wit, recreation or
game, and the right use and end of it.

The argument thus stands.

That is no lawful matter of sport and pastime, wherein the end and scope of
sport is not or cannot be had*

But in games of Lotery the end and scope of pastime cannot be had.

Lotery therefore is no lawful matter of sport and pastime.

The Assumption is thus strengthened: Da^. de ^ud. alea c. 9. rat. 2.
The end and scope of play is thereby to exercise either the ability of the
body or the industry of the mind.

But in games of Loterie is neither of these exercised: not the mind; because
there is no use of Art or skill, but all is put to hazard: Not the body; for
men sit at them without stirring ought save fingers and hands only.

In games of Loterie therefore the end and scope of game is not had.



In this Argument there are two things to be chiefly observed; and two Axioms
that the answer is principally to be applied unto.

First, that it touches and concerns only such games as consist of and
depend upon mere casualtie only: (not those that are mixed of chance and
art, wherein (...). S^pho^l. Pal^m and H. sych. (...) Et Plato de^ep. l. 2.
(...).
much skill and industry of mind may be used) which the Author indeed of this
argument only condemns, approving the other: and therefore the Assumption of
the latter Syllogism is not true of all games wherein a Lot is used, neither
is it the Authors mind that it should extend unto all.

Secondly, that the end and scope of recreation is not rightly assigned: which
is principally, as the very name of it implies, to (...). Arist. pol. 8.3.
(...). Ib. c. 5. Ludus est vtili^ propter quietem animae and delectation^m.
Thom. sum. par. 2^ 2 ae. q. 168. a.2. and 4. In ludis honestis voluptas
praecipue quaeritur. Martyr in Iud c 14 End of recreation to refresh body or
mind. Perkins Cas. of Consc l. 3. c 4 q. 3. rule 3. and Fennor of recreat.
rul. spec.. 1.
recreate and refresh the mind, or body, or both by delight.

Itaque Musicam a Gymnastica seceruit Arist. poli^. l. 8. c. 3. quod ista
conduc^t (...).
Recreation therefore and Exercise are two distinct things; And howsoever a man
may recreate himself by some exercise, as Fas est and carmine remitti Plin. Ep
9. l. 7. Haec mihi chartanuces, hae^ est m^hi charta fritill^ Martial epig. l
13.
he may also by some kind of study: yet no more is exercise therefore
recreation, then recreation is study. Yea the same exercise may be recreation
to one man that is not so to another: as when a man by the Physicians advice
draws a bow in his chamber, which he takes no pleasure in, nor does for or
with delight, it is an exercise only; but no pastime, as to him that shoots
abroad upon pleasure. So when two ride together in hunting, the one only to
exercise his body by riding, or to accompany or attend the other, not
regarding the game; the other merely or mainely for the game and the sport; it
is an exercise only, or an office, or service in the one, a recreation to the
other.

The end and scope then of an action is one thing; the means, whereby this end
and scope is effected and attained, is another thing. The end and scope of
recreation is the refreshing of the body or mind, and the delight of either.
The means whereby this is effected are diverse: For Summi viri sit se aut
exerceba^t, aut delectabant; imo delectab^^t exercebantque: ^am nierum est vt
bis opusculus animus in^endatur remitta ^^rque Plin. ep. 9. l. 7.
sometime it is done by industrious exercise of body or of mind, which comes
nearer in it own nature to serious business, then to recreation and refreshing:
in regard whereof it is said well of such as after long study betake them to
Ch^sse ouerfoud, because an ouerwise and philosophicke folly; filling men's
heads with as many fashions play-thoughts, as their affa^res did before. King
James (...).
chesse to refresh themselves therewith, that they do not leave study, but
change study, like one that leaves binding of fagots to go to thresh hemp.
Sometime it is effected without such industrious exercise, as Tale cuu^ carmen
nobis, divine po^^a, Quale sopor f^ssis in gramine, etc. Na^ neque me tantu^
venientis sibilus austri, Nec percussa iunant fluctuta^ iittora, nec quae,
Saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valies Virgil. B^col. Eclog. 5.
in taking a nap, (for that is a kind of recreation too), lying a long on the
grass, viewing some pleasant sight, bearing some noise of music, or charm
of birds, and the like: and therefore the Proposition of the prosyllogisme is
not sound. Now (...). Homer. Od^ss. (...) Sophocl. Palam. apud Polluc. animast.
this may be and is usually effected by games consisting merely or mixtly of
Lots, as well as by other, with those that take delight in them. Neither is it
a thing simply evil or disallowable to take delight in the casual and
uncertain or unexpected event of a thing, (that which makes jests and witty
speeches many times the more pleasant, in regard that Iocus ab inexpectato.
Vise Cicer. de orat. l. 2.
the answer is other in them then was expected) as being a matter light and
frivolous; since of recreations it is not required that they be serious.

CHAP. VIII. Answer to the Arguments less principal against lusorious Lots.
1. THus then we have dispatched all the principal Arguments, that tend
directly to prove Lusorious Lots simply unlawful, and so evil in themselves.
We proceed now to the less principal, that tend to prove them inconvenient
and inexpedient; or such as have been generally disallowed and condemned by
the most.

These Arguments therefore may be ranked in two rows: The former sort of them
are such as are drawn from the evils and inconueniencies that necessarily or
ordinarily attend these lusorious Lots, and the games that consist of them.

The evils that they are charged with are referred to four heads:

1. Cursing, banning and blaspheming: 2. Loss of time, and decay of health: 3.
Unlawful gain, or desire of gain: 4. And lastly, wasting of wealth.
From the first of these they thus reason: That which causes most horrible
cursing, banning, and blaspheming, is not to be endured: Dan. de lud. alea c.
9. rat. 7.
Dice-play so does; Therefore not to be endured.



I answer: Lot games, mixed especially (but those this Author impugneth not) do
no more cause these things then Boules, or Chesse, or other like, which many
take occasion by of the like outrages.

Secondly, it is not so much the game it self ordinarily in either* that
makes men thus ouershoot themselves, as Justinian. Cod. lib 3. tit 43. ^ig. ^.
Et Dan. ipse vbi sup. and Calu. in Epist. ad N.N script.
the wasting of their wealth, and loss of money at or by either: which being
severed from the game it self, it will neither cause it with the well-disposed
otherwise, nor would ordinarily occasion it with others.

These evils therefore (as the rest that follow) arising not from the nature of
the game, but either from the immoderate and inordinate use or rather abuse of
it, or from the evil and impious disposition of the gamster otherwise, make it
unlawful only to those that so use it, or are so affected at it, but not
simply in it self, nor to those that shall use it with due Caution in that
kind.

Yea but these Lot-plaies, says one, do necessarily draw or at least tempt
the very best to horrible blaspheming and profaning of Gods name: and are
therefore thus specially charged afresh.

To say, what luck is this, how crooked? is an horrible blaspheming of Gods
name:

But Pennor of recreat. spec. rule 4. reas. 3.
Lot-games necessarily draw or tempt the best so to say:

Therefore they necessarily draw or tempt the best to horrible blasphemy.

The Proposition is thus proved: Ibid.
To say, What a God, what peruers and crooked Providence of God? is horrible
blasphemy.

But to say, what luck, how crooked, is in plain words to say so:

Therefore to say, what luck, how crooked? is horrible blasphemy.



The Assumption is proved; because in Lot-games there is nothing that can be
accused (as in other games infirmity or want of skill may) but Gods immediate
direction, unless we will brutishly give Gods glory to Fortune.

To answer hereunto directly and briefly. Neither do Lot-games necessarily
tempt the best to say so; neither is it blasphemy so to say. There is great
difference between those two speeches rightly conceived, and as they may be
and are of good Christians ordinarily used: yea they are nothing alike indeed.

There is somewhat else beside God and his providence, as in all other casual
events, so in Lots, that such speeches may be applied unto. I am enforced too
often (I confess) to repeat what was ^aide down Cap. 2. 3.4.
at first, (while I tread the maze of sundry men's fancies;) that in casual
events there are two distinct things, the work of the Creator and the act of
the Creature: the latter whereof may such speeches be well applied unto, and so
have no tang or taint at all of impiety or blasphemy. They build all upon this
wrong ground, that there is a mere and immediate providence of God in all
Lots, which is not true, as has Cap. 2. 5.
formerly been proved, you may conceive it by examples of like casualtie in
other cases: To pass by actions of contingency carried by man's will and
forecast often crossing us in our lawful and warrantable courses, (as 2. Sam.
16.21, 22 cum 12.11, 12.
in David's despitefull wrong done him in the abuse of his Concubines by his
own son Absolome,) wherein we use such like terms without any impeachment
of or disparagement to the divine providence, which yet extends it self even
unto those actions: Suppose a man riding on the way through the Forest, where a
Dear rushing suddenly out of the covert makes his Horse start and throw him:
in this case for a man to say, what luck was this? or, what a cross accident
was this? is no blasphemy, nor any accusing of Gods providence, but a
complaining of the Creatures act and the event of it. Yea for any man to
censure such a speech as blasphemous, or to construe it as if he should say,
What a God is this? or, what a cross and crooked providence of God? were to
make himself one of Iam. 3.^.
those Masters, whom the Apostle James reproves: the rather for that he
charge that with blasphemy, wherein he cannot show the least point of
impiety.

For that of Fortune; if indeed by Fortune we understand such a blind Deity,
as the fabulous Poets fained, and idolatrous Infidels adored; it is idle and
impious for any man to ascribe ought thereunto. But if by it we understand the
casual and uncertain motion of the Creature, whereby something beside the
scope thereof is further effected; so we have Cap. 2. 1.
heard that Eccles. 2.14, 15. and 3.19 and 9.2, 3. Ruth 2.3.
the holy Ghost uses the term, and Luke 10.31, 32.
our Savior himself ascribes the Priests lighting upon the Passenger that
lay wounded on the way thereunto; By chance, or, by fortune (for the words are
all one) a Priest came down that way, and likewise a Leuite.

For the difference and dissimilitude of games, it is great indeed: but as
there are other things that a man may as^^^be the cause of his loss unto in
other games b^^^e Gods providence, which yet swaieth also in them: so is there
somewhat else here, to wit, the casual motion, and various disposition of the
Creature, a thing in it self and of it self distinct from Gods providence, as
we formerly showed.

2. The second evil attending on or accompanying these Lot-games is loss of
time, and decay of health by long sitting at them. The sum of the Argument
which the Author cutteth into twain, but may well be reduced to one, is this:

That which causes loss of time, which might much better be spent, is
unlawful: So Dan. de lud. al. c. 9. rat. 4 and Alex. Carpent. destruct vitior.
part. 4. c. 23. Non est aliud vspiam quod it a homines quasi visco irretitos
impediat, adeo vt totes eorum sensus occupet non secus ac fascino correptos.
Calvin. epist. 374. qui, si modus ten^atur, non damnat tamen.
does hazard in play: Its therefore unlawful.

The Proposition is confirmed by the Ephesians. 5.16. Col. 4.5.
Apostles authority, who wills Christian men to redeem the time, Dan. vbi
sup.
that is, to spend their spare time in honest and profitable employments, as in
reading on Gods word, visiting the sick, their friends, and such like.

The Assumption is proved by the nature of this kind of disport thus:

That which neither wearieth the body, nor cutteth of hope of conquest in time
and by continuance, that recreation causes loss of time:

But Dan. de lud. ale^ c 9. rat. 5 and rat. 2. and Taff. de emend. vit. l. 2.
c. 19.. 4.
this kind of disport neither wearieth the body: for there is no exercise at
all in it: nor cutteth off hope of conquest in time and by continuance; because
it depends wholly upon hazard, wherein the weakest and simplest may Sic, ne
perdiderit, non cessat perdere lus^r: Et reu^cat cupidas (al^, trepidas) alea
s^pe manus. Ovid art. l. 1. Qui saepe vincitur, rursus ad intentius studium,
Zabulo suadente animatur. Pseudo-Cyprian. de aleat.
hope, after never so long continued loss, at length to conquer and recover,
the dice changing their course, which they may as well do as otherwise: and
those that have won, hope well to have still the same luck, that before they
had.

This kind of game therefore causes (...) loss of time, having no stint or
end in it: which other games of necessity must needs have, either the body
being ouer-wearied, or the weaker side for want of skill past hope of winning.

This might have done well for a Caution; it does scarce well for an Argument.
For first, for the proposition of the former Syllogism, if it be understood
without limitation, that time ought to be spent always in the best duties
simply, it will ouer-throw all kind of disport whatsoever. For it fights
equally against all, be it of hazard mere or mixed, or of exercise of bodily
strength or wit. But that is not sound; neither is it the Apostles meaning or
purpose in that place to cut of all kind of recreation, which Gods word gives
good warrant for; but to cut off that idle and vain trifling out and
mispending of time needlessly, not only by recreations, but by other worldly
occasions, (...). Agatho Tr^goed, apud Clemen. Alex. stromat* l. 5.
whereby men many times ouer-lade themselves, with neglect of those things that
do most principally concern them, and Matthew. 6 33. Joan. 6*27.
which our Savior therefore would have them to seek principally and in the
first place, using the maine as a by-matter, and by-matters as the maine, as
one sometime said wittily; and Pr^ter propter vitam viuitur. Ennius apud Gell.
l. 19. c. 10. Magna pars vitae elabitur male agentibus, maxima nihil agentibus,
tota aliud agentibus. Senec. epist. 1. (...). Clem. Alex. p^dag. l. 2. c. 2.
living rather to any end then what they should live unto. And thus not only
gaming and play, but Luke 17.28.
buying also and selling, and building and planting, and Matthew. 24.38. Luke
1^.27.
eating and drinking, and Luk 14.20.
wiuing and wedding, and Luke 14.18, 19.
husbandry and tillage may become sins against that iniunction of redeeming
the time, when Villa non est pe^catum: and villa tamen pec^atum est, si a
Christo ^ remoretur. Bernard.
they shall take up the due time of other necessary duties. And yet are both
of them warrantable and good taken in their own time.

For the best works simply are not ever to be done; else should every day be
a Sabbath day, (as he sometime said in an other sense) and not any week day a
work day; or if the week be for work (I mean worldly work) then the whole
week one worke-day, and no minute or moment left for any kind of recreation;
it being a worse thing then work, (...). Diogen. apud P^ut. de tranquil.
(...). Ibid.
since that (...). Aristot. Ethic. Nicom. l. 10. c. 6.
work is the end of it, and (...). Arist. Topic. l. 3. c. 1. and Physic. l. 2.
c. 3. Finis praestantior ^is qu^ ad finem.
the end is ever more excellent then what tends thereunto.

(...). Synes. Epist. 148.
No sin indeed is ever or any where to be done: but the same good works are
not to be done at all times. Negatiua ligant ad vbique and semper: affirmatiua
ligant vbique and semper, sed non ad vbique n^que ad semper. Gerson. regul. mor.
Negative commandments bind every where and to all times: Affirmative
precepts bind every where and at all times; but they bind not to every place,
nor unto all times. The work therefore fittest for the time is ever then the
best work; because the best, though not simply, yet in regard of all
circumstances at that instant concurring.

For (...). Pindar. Pyth. ode 9.
the seasonable doing of each thing is a matter of much moment: since (...)
Eccles. 3.1. (...). Gr g. Naz. ad Eunom. sermon. 1.
there is a time and season for all lawful employments, be they serious or
lusorious, civil or sacred. And (...). Greg. Naz. ibid.
neither is a good action good when it is not seasonably done; nor a meaner
matter omitted without sin in his season, though it be to tend a matter in it
self of more moment. In ludi defectu potest esse pecca^u^. Thom. sum. par. 2a

It is a sin for a man sometime not to recreate himself: it is not only a

sin for him to do a less good when he might and should do a greater; but

it is a sin for him to be about something, though a better thing otherwise,
when he is called to tend a meaner matter: as it is sin for a servant to be
reading on a good book, yea on the Bible it self, when he should be serving
in his Masters supper.

The Apostles speech therefore cutteth not off all recreation, it being in it
self lawful and good, and Eccles. 3.4. Zech. 3.10. and 8 5.

though too common a sin: but it proves not that to be sin or evil in it
self, wherein some men, yea or many men, misse-spend their time, albeit it be
evil then to them.

Secondly the Assumption makes as well against other games that men may spend
much time in, as against those of this kind. Such are Tables and Cards as well
as bare Dice: yea such is Chesse, which some also, as Modus and in h^c
seruandus. Fuerunt enim qui posthabitis serijs huic vni haererent. Zuing^de
form. adolesc.. 3.
one well observes, have sat continually close at, neglecting all serious
affairs: neither is there any game ordinarily that takes up more time then
it, with those that doat on it, especially where two singularly skillful and
somewhat equal concur.

For the proof of the Assumption; It is no sound course of arguing to reason
Ap^sse ad ^sse.
from what may be: as to say, What a man may spend much time about without
tediousness, or despair of being ever overthrown in, that a man does
mispend, or must needs mispend much time about. That indeed, if he will, he
may mispend much time about, but he need not, unless he will: neither
sinneth*he if he do not, because he might if he would. Many other things there
are that a man may spend time amiss in, and more then he well may; yea wherein
many do, as in pleasant and delightful discourse Ami^i sures temporis. Lips.
t^mpus nobis surripientes, ^t Senec. ep. 1.
with such friends whose company a man takes special delight in and could
endure to discourse all day withal; or in Frequens migratio instabilis est
animi. Sen. epist. 70. Frequens ac mobilis tra^situs maximu^ perfecti operis
est impedimeut^^. Pater^^l l. 1.
iournying abroad, and in flitting from place to place and 1. Tim. 5.13.
from house to house, and the like; which things yet are not therefore simply
evil in themselves (I mean, Zech. 3 10. I^d. 11.40. (...) ad confabulandum.
Iun.
mutual society, and iournies for pleasure) if they be not evil used, though
they be evil to them by whom they are so abused.

To this may be annexed that which is alleged by way of amplification in one
of the former Arguments, that by long sitting at this game, while men spend
whole days at it, Dan d^ lud. al^ae c. 9. rat. 2.
they impair their bodily health and strength, and get of^ the gout. An
inconvenience arising from the immoderate use of it; (and Soluens membra Venus,
s^lue^s and membra Lyaeus, Membra resoluentem progenerant ^^^agram.
such as may spring likewise from the immoderate use of other things, though
not evil in themselves:) which as no wise, nor godly man but condemns and
abhors; so none of the one will, or the other ought to condemn the thing it
self so abused, especially where it may otherwise be well used, for it.

3. The third evil accompanying it or occasioned by it is Dan. ibid. not. 6.
the feeding of covetous affections. For where is there greedier desire of
gain? where more Vnde (...) p^o v^t^ratori^, Ephesians. 4 14.
cheating and cony-catching then in these games? Dan. ibid.
yea worse are they then usury, yea then usury upon usury: for here is
increase without lone or delay of time, in an instant, and that equal all out
with the maine principal: Alex. Carpe^t. destruct. vit. par. 4. c. 23. and
Astesan. sum l. 5. tit. 30 q1. similes lusori^us qui C^ristum exuerunt vestibus
mittentes sortem. Io. Gritsch. quadrag. ser. 10.
worse then robery by the highway side: stripping those that they eat and
drink with not of money only, but of apparel too, even to the ve ry shirt;
that which thieves will scarce do.

I answer in a word: All this may be help easily either by playing for
nothing; or if men be of that mind, that they think Dicunt no^nu^^i se non
oblect^ri ludo, nisi pro pe^uniae ludant. Martyri^ Iud. c. 14. sine lucro
sriget lusus. Balmf. dialog.
without gaining cold gaming; If play be for a small matter, the loss whereof
is no hurt to him that loses it, and it be applied to a common good, it is
lawful. Perkins Cas. of Conscienc. l 3. c 4. q 3. rule 3.
by playing for such trifles as may be won without much loss to the looser,
making choice of such to play with as we know able well to spare it, and
spending presently what is so won in common between the winners and loosers.
Neither ought those evils to prejudice the lawful and honest use of any
exercise that may easily be severed from it.

Beside that this ground admitted will overthrow all playing, even for victory
too, as well as for gain: since we may as well condemn, and so Satis ali^qui
laboramus cupiditate pecuniae, ambitione vincendi ac excellendi; quid hos
morbos ludis ex^itamus? Martyr in Iud. c. 14
some do, the one for feeding and fostering ambitious humors, as we may the
other for noursing and nourishing covetous desires: and so all gaming for
either shall together go to ground; that which seems ouer-harsh, and Fac^ss^t
ergo inhumana illa philosophia, quae non ta^tum malign nos private licito b^n
ficentiae diuinae fructu, sed obtiner^ no^ potest, nisi hominem cu^ctu s^nsibus
spoliatum in stipitem redegerit. Calu instit ^ib. 3. c. 10 3. Christians are
neither Stoics nor Epicures. Paul disputes against both. Act. 17.18. Greenham
par. 2. c. 16 7.
to savor rather of Stoicall austeritie, then of Christian severity.

4. The fourth evil these games are charged with is the Dan. de lud. al^ae, c.
9. rat. 6. and Ius^inian. C^d. l. 3. ^i^. 23 leg. 2. -- neque enim loculis
comitantibus ^itur Ad casum ^abulae, posita sed luditur ar^a. Iuuen. sat. 1. Si
quis ^abet nummos veniens, exibit inanis. Vitalis scholin catalict.
wasting of wealth and of men's worldly estates, that which should sustain and
support them and theirs, and wherewith they should be helpful and beneficial
to others. For there is no game that men spend and wast more upon then these,
at which many make away Land and living, goods and chattels, jewels and plate,
and their apparel from their backs. Yea Cum omnia defec^rint, ex^^emo and
nouissimo iact^ de liberate and de corpore contendunt. Tacit. de mor. German.
some when they have played all away, have at length staked them selves, if they
lost, to be made Slaves: in so much that these games have often been the very
bane of great personages, and the ruin of great houses.

The same answer must be given here, that was often given before. This arises
not from the nature of the thing itself: it comes not from the spring, but
from the filthy channel that the stream passes by: it may be taken at the
fountaine-head without any of this filth, and it is no more defiled to those
that there take it, then if there were no such abuse or defilement at all of it.

Beside that on this ground might boules, and shooting, and tennis, and many
other like exercises (yea Proverb. 21.17* Persequi singulous longum est, quoru^
aut latrunculi, a^^ pila, aut exc^que^di in sole corporis c^ra consumpsere
vitam. Sen. de breu. vit. ca. 13. E^ia^ ludus pilae, si immodice vel cupi^e
^^creatur, mortale fit. Alex. de Ales sum. part. 4. q. 48. and Henr. Herp. in
decal praecept. 3. s^rm 3.
any game) be likewise condemned, because at such also many mispend both their
time and their estates. If at these more then at those, it is because they are
more usual and more obuious: And the difference, being but in degree, may make
the one worse then the other, but must of necessity casheere both, if it
condemn either.

I might well here pass by, should I not be suspected to conceal somewhat that
were of some weight, what is alleged out of Lyra, that in his Praeceptorie (a
little Treatise of his upon the commandments) Ex^at Nicolai Lyrani libellus in
qu^ ex varij^ scriptoribus rations 9. collegit, propter quas alea ludus inter
Christianos minime tolerandus videatur. Dan. de lud. alea c. 8. he should upon
diverse good grounds gathered out of sundry Writers, nine especially, condemn
this kind of game
, Babington on Command. 8.
as coveting an other man's goods greatly; being a mighty means of deceit;
passing usury; causing lying, swearing, brauling and many idle words; being an
offense to the godly; breaking the Laws; mispending time; and what not? and
that thereupon he concludes Dau vhi sup.
that such games are not to be tolerated or endured among Christians.

True it is that Noue^ circumsta^tias enum^rat Hostiensi^ de lud. alea did. 1.
quaru^ quaelibet est peccatu^ mortale. Lyra ad praecept. 7. expos. 3. and

deadly sins make the game therefore such that is accompanied therewith, as
these games often are. And in steed of those nine he might as well, with Greg.

some other Friars find in dice-play, as R. Parker of the Cross.
one of ours of late in the use of the Cross, the breach of the whole
Decalogue, and of all the ten Commandments.

These, I say, I might well pass by, as well the one as the other; partly
because in effect they bring no new matter; and partly because these evils are
equally common to all games, and do not so much concern the nature of this
kind of play, as contain general abuses of all kind, though applied more
specially to these: they are the faults of the Gamsters not of the games: and
as one says well of Lots writing of this argument of Lotery; so say I of game,
and of Lots used in game, Legitimus vsus ab illegitimo abusu distinguendus est.
Baro in Ion. c. 1. Nosi^u^ est inter vsum legitimu^ and corruptela^ discernere.
Calvin. in Act. c. 1. Quod enim Meisner. philos. sobr. par. 1. praefat. Vsus
habet landem, (abest culpa, saltem) crimen abusus habet. Iraque quod Petru^ a
Well in tract. de vsuri^; Veras in hi^ vsus maneat, tollatur abusu^.
The Lawful use of them must be distinguished from the unlawful abuse.

Besides that the scope of these Authors both the one and the other (in regard
whereof I may well say that they are not so sincerely cited, but forced to say
what indeed they do not) is to condemn only the games so used or rather so
abused as too too commonly they are; not to quarrel with the light and
lusorious use of a Lot, nor to pass a peremptory sentence against the use of
all such games in general, which Si dispositio vel euentus sortis expectatur a
fortuna tantum, (quod in ludo taxillatorio fit, Thom. de sort* c. 5.) nullum
est vitium. Lyra in Pro. 16. Ludus aleae qui fortunae innititur non est
illicitus, vbi seruatur congruitas personae, materiae, mensurae, temporis. Idem

dispar. Idem ibid. Licite potest ludi gratis, volca^sa con^^^ij vel
recreationis. Angel. sum. and sic loan. Aquil Vincent. and cateri
themselves both in the same places and elsewhere do otherwise allow.

Let me ad but a word or two concerning that clause that to this Argument is
annexed; and so I leave it and pass to the next: Babington on Command. 8.
The Lord forbids 1 Thessalonians. 5.22.
all appearance of evil; and all occasions of evil.

True it is; Sub vitio aliquo prohibit, omnes vitij illius causae and
occasiones prohibentur. Perkins arm ll. aur. c. 8. Vitare peccatae est vitare
occasiones peacatorum. Melaneh loc com. ^2.
the Commandments that forbid any sin, forbid those things also that may be
occasions of that sin. But they inhibit not generally the use of all things
to all, that any does or may take occasion of evil by. They forbid them to
those to whom they are that way dangerous, not to those that may and do use
them without danger in that kind.

And no less true is it, that Christian men ought to 1 Thessalonians. 5.22. (...).
non tantum ab omni specie mali, vt Beza, sed specia m^la, vt vulgata. Et malas
res and malas pariter species deuitare. Bern. consid. lib. 3. quicquid male
coloratum fuerit. Ibid.
abstain from all appearance of evil: that is, Quanquam Ambros. and Chrysostom.

that they are both to avoid, what they may justly suspect to be sinful,
though they do not evidently see it or certainly know it to be such: as also
Siquid mala specie malu^ aliquid praetendat, and si malu^ non sit, ne mala
specie malu^ exemplu^ d^eis: non enim occasione^ mala suspicio^is de vobis dure
debetis cum vos mala^ conscientia^ non habratis. Hiruens in epist. Anselmi
nomine editus.
to forbear what may make them suspected to be Sinners, and to live otherwise
then either indeed they do, or of right they ought to do by the rules and
laws of Christianity: for further then these two branches, as I take it, that
precept extends not. But how the use of any Lot at all in game, or the use of
a Lot simply in this kind of game, should be brought within compass of either
of these two branches, I see not; especially being so used as it is or may be
used of those that are godly and religiously disposed, and with such Cautions
as Chap. 9.
hereafter shall be given.

5. After these arguments fetched from the Evils and inconveniences pretended
necessarily or usually to accompany these games, comes the last maine
argument taken from humane testimonies public and private, of such as have
either in judgment condemned, or by authoritis inhibited these kind of games.
I will endeavor to bring their arguments into some form that we may the
better judge of them.

First therefore they seem to reason on this manner: Magistratus edicto

The Assumption is confirmed by diverse instances, which may be referred all to
two heads, civil constitutions, and Ecclesiastical canons.

The Civil constitutions are either of the whole Roman Empire; whereof some
are said to be general C. derelig. sumpt. suner. Cum antiquitus militibus

Other some are special, Justinian. iu autheut. (collat. 9. tit. 15. and in
Cod. l. 1. tit 6. leg. 18.) nominatim prohibet ne Episcopus, Presbyter, aut
Diaconus, vel ipsi ludant (ad tabulas) vel ludentes aspi^iant; si secus

condemning some particular abuse of them only, to wit, wheremen play away
more then their ability will well bear. Or they are positive laws of some
particular nations; as Babington on the eighth Commandment.
of the Land we live in; wherein 12. Rich. 2.
all dicing is said to be generally forbidden; 21. Henr. 4.
Dicers taken punished with six days imprisonment, 11. Henr. 7.
and with sitting in the stocks; 17. Edward. 4.
Keepers of dicing houses with three years, Plaiers there with two years
imprisonment: and Babings. ibid.
of the state of Geneua, wherein the very making of dice is condemned and
inhibited.

The Ecclesiastical Canons likewise produced in this point are either general
and universal, as In canonibus Apostolorum ludus idem interdicitur. Can. 42.
and 43. Dan de lud. alea c. 8.
the Canons of the Apostles so commonly termed, inserted into Great. did. 35

a certain Clerk in the Decretall is found deposed for being a Dicer and a

Clerici. (decretal. l. 3. c. 1. c. 1^) Ad aleas and taxillos non ludant, neo
huiusmodi ludis intersint. Mart. ib. and Dan. c. 7. and Gloss. ibid. nec
participes erunt ludentibus, ne^ spectatores ludi.
the one held at Rome under Innocent the third, forbidding Clergymen dice and
hucklebones, either to play with them, or to be present at such play; the other
Nullum omni^o sieve Clericum sieve Laicum alea deinceps ludere: qui secus

50.
at Constantinople under the Emperor Justinian, inhibiting all in general, as
well Laymen as Clerks, to play ever after at dice, under pain of
excommunication.

Or they are Particular Canons of national or provincial Synodes, as of Si
quis fidelis alea (^ tabula) luserit, placuit eum abstinere: and si eme^datus
cessauerit, p^st annum poterit communione reconciliari. Council. Elib. c. 79.
a Spanish Council held at Eliberis; suspending every Christian man from the
Lords table, that shall play at dice or tables, for a twelue-month, upon
promise of amendment to be received again then: and of Babingt. on Command. 8.
two French Synodes held, the one at Rochel, the other at Nimaux, both
condemning and inhibiting the use of these games in general.

6. For the Proposition of this argument and the conclusion following from it;
as it is conceived, it comes not near home to the maine point in question:
If it be conceived as it should, that whatsoever is forbidden by the civil or
canon Law is evil simply in it self, it is not true; a thing confessed by
Mali sunt ludi isti, quia prohibiti; non prohibiti, quia mali Angel. de Clauas.

c. 4. q. 2. Alea non est prohibita quia per se mala, sed mala facta quia
prohibita, and quatenus prohibita. Et causa prohibitionis sunt mala quae
communiter ex ipsis sequuntur. Angel. sum.
some before alleged in this very particular we now deal in. Humane laws
restrain the common use of things indifferent; which things notwithstanding
cease not to be indifferent in themselves and in their own nature: and so make
them unlawful so far forth as they bind, and no further. But the maine
question here is, not whether the use of a Lot in game be prohibited by man's
law, but whether it be inhibited by Gods law or no. For many things are lawful
by Gods law, that are not lawful by man's law: as to transport such and such
commodities without special license, to trade and traffic into such and such
foraine parts, to eat flesh at certain times, to bring some sorts of fish
into the market for sale, and the like, which things yet are not evil simply,
or in themselves.

Yea take the Proposition as it is propounded, that Whatsoever is by humane
Laws forbidden, cannot be done without offense; and it is not all out true
neither. For how many cases are there wherein the Summists and Casuists both
Ciuilians and Canonists with the Schoolmen agre^^, that without just offense
given that may be done, which by the letter of some positive law is unlawful?
Or what is more common then these and the like rules in their writings; that

disuse or Counter-custome is a kind of abrogation of them. Let me ad that
which in the present case sometime may be somewhat, what they say Non peccat
qui legem non seruat, vbi and quando est valde difficile; neque qui non seruat,
vt pro stulto non habeatur. Nauar. euchirid. cap. 27. sect. 283.
of him that keeps not a Law, where it is an hard matter to keep it, and
where he should be but counted a fool if he should, that such a Transgressor
is in common equity excused. In some case therefore may that be done without
just cause of scandale, the doing whereof is by humane Laws inhibited. Neither
suppose I is there any man so extremely censorious, that because flesh on
Fridaies is forbidden with us by law, he will in that regard hold a man guilty
of sin, for every bit of flesh, that being in company with others, or having
it readier at hand when he is hungry, he shall put into his mouth, especially
not doing it of any contempt, and being one that is regardfull of the end of
that Law otherwise.

7. For the Assumption of the former argument, it would be considered, both
what is forbidden, and how it is forbidden.

For the former; neither is all Lotery used in game generally condemned: for
there might be use of it in those games that the civil Laws expressly allow,
(to omit that Tertius ludius a Iustiniano probatus (...) dicitur, quando vnus
scil. per sortem deligitur ex pluribus qui imperet reliquis, si credamus
Pollescil. 9. Gregor. Tolos. syntagin. lib. 39 c. 4.
some good Lawiers suppose a Lot game to have been one of them; for what they
were indeed is Vise Gregor. Tolos. ibid. and Alciat. in verb. Lud. Alea.
not certain) for joining and leading, and taking of turns, and the like; as
there is use often thereof in that kind in games allowed by our Laws; as when
in shooting by arrows shuffled and severed again, men are sorted into sides,
or it is decided who shall lead.

Neither are those games alone prohibited that consist of Lot or depend
thereupon, Dubious euentus fortunae contractus illicitos non facit. Iul. Clar.
sent l. 5. Ludu^. Non im fortuna fu^datur aleae prohibitio. Delrio mag. disq.

name mentioned.

Again Licet sit prohibitum ludere, non tamen est perpetuo prohibitum;
quandoque enim permittitur. G^^ss. ad ff. lib. 11. t^t. 4. leg. 4.
they condemn not these games simply as evil in themselves, which Alearum

forbid all playing for gain at them; which yet at some other games Sed nec

at these also upon somewhat stricter terms, as for somewhat to be spent
privately in common, they allow.

So that it is not the games themselves that are simply condemned, but Ludus

the best Interpreters according therewith; and as the Authors also that cite

A man, well says one of them, is not to be condemned, if being weakly or
evil at ease he recreate himself by playing at Hazard, so he hazard not his
moneys: for it is especially to be observed, what the scope was of those laws,
that forbad such kind of games: now that was that men should not wast their
estates: to which purpose it is enacted, that no man hazard above a shilling:
this was the scope and drift of the Law, to provide that moneys might not be
misspent. Which if they be not, then the Law is not broken.

. 8. For the Laws of our Land how unfitly they are alleged to the present
purpose, to wit, See Babington on Command. 8.
to prove dice to be evil and utterly to be condemned, yea or generally
prohibited, Cards and Tables being notwithstanding allowed and approved; may
appear by a particular surueigh both of the Laws to that end cited, as also
of others that have since in later times been enacted.

The 12. Rich. 2. ca. 6
first Law wherein dice are said to be generally forbidden, enacteth only that
All servants of husbandry, laborers, servants of any artificer or victualer
shall have bow and arrows, and use the same on Sundaies and Holidaies; and
shall leave all playing at Tennis, football, quoites, dice, casting of the
stone, kailes, and other such importune games. The 11. Hen. 4. cap. 4.
next Act imposing a penalty of 6. days imprisonment upon all offenders
against the former. The 17. Edw. 4. ca. 3
third of them discovers the maine scope of these acts, namely, to bring in a
more frequent use of the bow, because the defense of the Land was much then by
Archers: and withal gives diverse other grounds of the former prohibitions
then revived and renewed, to wit, sundry unlawful games as closh, kailes,
boules, qeckbord etc. newly invented, gaming houses erected and so commonly
employed; Gamesters thereby impouerished; murders and roberies occasioned etc.
Whereupon it enacteth further a penalty of twenty pounds and three years
imprisonment against every one that shall keep, and of ten pounds and two
years imprisonment against every one that shall haunt, any such house. The 11.
Henr. 7. ca. 2.
fourth commands that no servant or labourer play at tables save for meat
and drink: nor at any other unlawful game save at Christmas, and then in his
Masters dwelling house only: every one so offending to be set in the stocks,
and he that suffers it in his house to forfeit a noble at least. To which,
though not alleged, may be annexed 19. Hen. 7. ca. 12.
another Act of little later date, forbidding the same persons to play at
tables, tennis, closh, dice etc. save as above, with the same penalties upon
persons therein delinquent imposed.

And these are all, yea more then all, the laws that are particularly cited.
But because we are referred to another work for more matter in this kind; See
more in Pultons Abridgement. Babington on Command. ^.
let us see also what later Laws have enacted concerning such games, if we
shall not tire out our Reader with proofs so impertinent.

The later laws therefore 33. Henr. 8. ca. 9. revived 2. and 3. Phil. and Mar.
ca. 9.
forbid keeping any common house, alley, or place of bouling, coiting, closh,
cailes, tennis, dieing, tables, or carding for gain, lucre and living, and
haunting places so kept, without special placard expressing what games, and
what persons to use the same: As also private playing at tennis, tables, dice,
cards, boules, closh, coiting or logeting by any artificer, husbandman,
labourer, apprentice, iourneyman, seruingman etc. out of Christmas, and then
also any where save in his Masters house and presence: And further, playing at
boules by any man at any time in open places out of his garden or Orchard;
several pecuniary mulcts imposed upon the former offenses: yet allowing any
servant to play at cards, dice or tables with his Master, or any Gentleman
repairing to his house openly in his house and in his presence; and permitting
any Nobleman or Gentleman of a hundredth pound lands per annum to license his
servants at his discretion to play at cards, dice, tables, boules or tennis
within his house, garden or orchard, either among themselves, or with others
repairing to them: 5. Edw. 6. cap. 25.
Victuallers to put in recognisance not to suffer such games in their houses:
And lastly 22. Henr. 8. c 12. revived 35. Elisab. cap. 7.
all wandering persons using unlawful games to be punished as Rogues and
Vagabonds.

By this particular recital of the several Laws that either have been or
might further have been alleged in this argument, may to any dim eye at the
first view plainly appear, that the Laws of our Land rather justify and
approve then condemnne the games questioned.

For first they forbid indeed some use of them, but withal they forbid as well
bouling and coiting and tennis, and logetting, and throwing the stone: some
exercises of art and skill, some of industry and actiuitie, or of dexterity
and agilitie; yea bouling more strictly and more generally then either carding
or dicing; which yet no man that I know does thereupon condemn or conclude to
be unlawful.

Again though they forbid them to be used by some persons in some places at
some times; yet they allow them to other persons, and those of the best note;
as also to the same persons in other places at other times. See Dalions Justice
of Peace, title Of games unlawful.
Whereby it appears evidently that they restrain the use of the games only,
but condemn them not as simply evil in themselves; yea rather that they
approve them, in that they appropriate the common and ordinary use of them to
great personages; unless we will say that N^mque ibi fortunae venia^ damus:
alea turpis, Turpe and adulterium mediocribus: haec tamen illi Omnia cum
faciant, hilares, nitidique voca^tur. Iuuenal. Sa^yr. 11.
the laws license great ones to sin more then others, whose greatness
rather should restrain them from any thing that is simply evil, in regard of
the hurt that their evil examples may do.

The end and scope of the Law is partly to reform abuses about these games, as
mispending of time and coin in common gaming houses or elsewhere; and partly
to bring into use an other kind of exercise in the room of them, In maxima
fortuna minima licentia. Salust. Minimum decet libere, cui multum licet. Senec.
Troad. Ab. surdum est enim (...). vt de Demetr. Phaler. Athen. dipnosop. l 12.
Nec vlli panciora licent, quam cui omnia.
which such variety of games made the more to be neglected; to wit, shooting
in the long bow, a matter of much use, and of great weight then in war.

Now for mine own part so far am I from misliking these laws, that,
considering the great and general abuse of the games by them prohibited,
committed by such as both wast their pretiousest time, and throw away their
wealth and thrift together at these exercises and the like; I wish rather that
both the laws were yet seuerer then they are, and that those that are, were
better put in execution then for the most part they be.

For the French States and Synodes with their Canons and Constitutions, having
not seen them, I can say nothing but this to them; that if they have utterly
abandoned the use of those games among them; (which I doubt much of) yet
neither does that prove every lusorious Lo^ simply unlawful, nor make the
games in that regard evil unto us.

9. For the Canon Law, it condemns dicing and tabling no otherwise then the
Ciuill-law does, as the Glossers and Summists did before expound either: both
more specially in the Clergy; because 2. Tim. 2.4. dum pastoris sensus

many things that are lawful to others, yet are not so fit for, or so well
beseeming men of their rank: In which regard the same Canons and Councels
together with others, that forbid them the use of these games, forbid them also

things yet at this day neither are simply condemned as unlawful to all

used by them, though the abuse in this kind may be also, and no doubt is
ouer-great.

Again neither were the Canons, it seems, of old very precisely kept in this
kind; ( Hine in Sidonij A^uernorum Episcopi Epistolis tum venatus, tum aleae

neither are they commonly understood to inhibite all use of those games that
are by them condemned.

all such voluptuous games condemned in Clergymen, by occasion whereof
affecting a courtly kind of carriage, they fall into dishonest and dissolute
courses. But of that more anon.

10. I pass to the next argument much of the same nature with the former:

That which has been generally both by Christians and Heathen condemned as
evil, cannot to Christian men be lawful:

But dicing has by both been generally condemned.

It cannot therefore be lawful to Christians.

The answer to this argument (to omit that it comes not home to the maine
question concerning the general use of Lots in disport, which though all here
said were granted, still stands) must consist in a surueigh of the particular
allegations, that for proof of the assumption are produced. Of all men by
general consent as it were this vile game as most vile is detected and
detested: Heathen ever hated it; Christians ever abhorred it. Babington on
Command. 8. Adco vt quodlibe^ hominum genus com^^ni consens^, tanquamipsius

To begin with Christian writers, some indeed of them condemn all use of dice
as simply unlawful: but those not many, nor till of late days, as by the
former discourse also may partly appear. Yea they that allege these
Testimonies themselves allow some use of them, and such use as the Authors
alleged by them do even as much condemn as that use that these themselves
do disallow.

hunting and hauking, have been as commonly, yea are more generally and
peremptorily condemned by them, which yet are confessed not to be simply evil
or unlawful therefore in themselves: The testimonies alleged are not past two
or three beside those that were discussed in the former argument; and those
either of no weight at all, or nothing pertinent to the purpose.

Dan. de lud. alca c. 8.
Cyprian, says one, as holy a man as any other in his time, says that even
the Devil himself was the first Author of this harmefull invention: in regard
whereof that godly man witnesses that it ought with the whole heart to be
accursed and abhorred of us, since we can have no safe or saving traffic
with the Devil or any of his devices. Whereunto it is further added that
Cyprian reports that the Devil, says Dan. ibid. c. 10.
one, Mercury the Heathens God, says Tassin. de e^^end. vita l. 2. c. 19. 6.
another, having invented both cards and dice, caused his own image and the
images of other Idols, to be painted on the cards (in steed whereof we have
other pictures now upon them) to be adored ever by the gamesters, with a cup of
wine and a kiss, at the entrance into game.

A man might upon better ground argue thus against Physic and Goldsmiths
work: Tertullian an ancient Father, and one that Da magistrum, Cyprianus
dicere solitus, Tertullianu^ significans. Paulus Cypriani notarius apud Hieron.
in Catalog.
Cyprian commonly called his Master, says that Angeli desertores metallorum
opera nudauerunt, and herbarum ingenia traduxeru^t. Tertull. de habitu mul Et

the use of Herbs for physic, and curious working in costly metals were
invented by evil Angels to please women withal; and that Vt Enoch refert.
Ibid.
Enoch himself says so in a work of his Vide longu^ satis opusculi huius
pseudepigraphi (...) apud Scalig. in notis ad Eusebius. Chron.
yet extant, whereof that authority in the Jude 14, 15.
Epistle of Jude is a part: But Christians may have no dealing with the Devil
or with any of his devices: and therefore may not meddle in that kind either
with herbs or with metals: nor Christian women wear any gold about them: (as
Tertullian supposing 1. Tim 2.9. 1. Pet. 3.3. Et Tertull. lsc. praealleg.
the Apostles also to speak for him thereupon there concludes;) nor Christian
men or women use the benefit of physic; as Macarius homil. 48. mundanis
concedit vsum medicinae, sanctis negat.
some other of the Ancients have held. But this argument were too weak: and
yet the other is far weaker; being built upon the testimony and authority of a
mere counterfeit Author.

There is a work indeed De aleatorilus.
of that argument in the In edit. Pame ana.
late editions of Cyprian, (for in the In edit. Er. (...) alijs antiq.

his, Sole clariora sunt Cypriani opera. Hieron. catalog. B. Cyprianus instar

a certain learned man after long study invented the game of dicing by the
instinct of the Devil: and that thereupon he caused his own picture to be
drawn with the dicing tables as his invention in his arms (for as for Cards
or any image painted on them there is no one word in the book) to be adored by
the Gamesters at the beginning of their game. Whereupon he terms Alcae
tabula Diaboli venabulum.
the dicing Table the Devils hunting spear: and says that Aleae qui ladit,
prius auteri cius sacrificare debet: and sacrificio Diaboli manus polluit.
who so plaieth at dice, does first sacrifice to the Devil the Author of that
game, and polluteth his hands with diabolical sacrilege. If any such custom
were in his times, it was impious: but both the story it self seems idle and
frivolous; and Testibus non testimonijs credendu^ esse lex iubet. Petr. Clan

the Author being uncertain the authority is of no weight.

A third tells a long tale of a Parliament held by Lucifer in hell, wherein
this game was agreed upon, and a Church constituted of those that follow it,
whereof Lucifer himself should be Pope or chief head, the other Devils his
Gardinalls, the common dicing houses the cathedral Churches, the Tauernes
parish Churches, and each family a private Chapel for the 12. days in
Christmas; the dice the Missall or Masse-booke with his 21. black letters; and
so he goes on in his apish manner to apply all the Priests Masse-attire, and
all the mysteries of their Mass to this devilish device; as indeed well suit
they may and sort the one with the other. And of the same stamp with these
Frierly fancies, mere poetical fictions, are that counterfeit Cyprians
conceits: both the phrase and the frame of the work bewray what the Author
was.

11. Yea but Aleam inuenit Demon. August. de ciuit. Dei lib. 4. Babington on
Command. 8.
Augustine says that the Devil invented Dice; and that in a work that is
questionless his; in his fourth book of the City of God.

It is true that those words are found in Augustines Index; but with reference
to a place not in Augustines fourth book of the City of God, where there is no
such matter, save that Varro non in rebus humanis, sed in rebu^ diuinis ludos
s^enicos posuit, etc. Aug. decinit. Dei l. 4. c. 1.
Stageplaies are by Varro esteemed a part of divine worship, and that the
Devils much delighted in them; but to a place of Lewis Viues his Commentary
upon Augustine; where Augustine says that Societas impioru^ non secundum Deum,
sed secundum hominem viuentiu^, and in ipso cultu falsae contemptaque vera
diuinitatis doctrinas hominum damonaemue secta^tium. Aug de ciuit. Dei lib. 14.

there is a Society of ungodly men, who live not after God but after man,
following humane traditions and doctrines of Devils in the worship of false
Gods and contempt of the true God: And Viues on him; Viues ad Aug. ibid. Sunt

There are learnings that Devils have delivered unto men, as Magic,
Astronomic, and all kind of divination except prophecy. Plato in Phad^o
^^monem, cui erat nomen Theuth, inuenisse scribit literas, arith. geom. astron.
aleam, etc.
Plato writes in Phadrus (a Dialogue of his so entitled) that a Spirit or a
Devil called Theuth invented letters, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, and
Dice, and praesented them to Thamus who was then King of Egypt. Dialectitam
qu^que hanc contentiosam and p^rtinacem non dubium est ab ingenio diabolico

And there is no doubt says he, but that this wrangling and cauilling Logic
proceeded from some deuilish disposition: it loves always to strive so
against the truth, refusing to yield to any that shall speak to better
purpose, and by falsehood reioicing to overcome truth. Augustines Index
therefore deceived the Author of this Argument, and made him father that on
Augustine which he no where says, but another only on him, and that not as
his own neither, but as the report of an other. It is a fable of Platoes, Vnde

For the thing it self whether it be true or false, is not greatly material.

some others have of Attalus King of Asia, has as little, if not less ground;
the invention is far auncienter. To pass, I say, by the maine current of
Authors and Writers crossing Plato in this point, we might as well upon this
ground condemn Grammar, and Astronomy, and Arithmetike, and Geometry, and
the use of Letters and Ciphers, as of tables and dice, as diabolical
inventions; seeing this fable of Plato refers them all to the same original
and to the same Author: as Vise Tertull. de coron milit.
the common use of the Heathen was to ascribe the invention of every Art and
matter of moment to some one Idol or other.

Chrysostom indeed (for I will conceal nothing that may seem ought to this
purpose) speaking in general terms says, that Non Deus dat ludere, sed
diabolus: noli ergo haec a Deo poscere quae a Diabolo accipis. Chrysostom. in Matthew.
hom 9.
Play or game is not of God but of the Devil: and that Christu^ sientem

we read that Christ Luk 19.41. Joan. 11.35.
wept often, but never that he laughed, or so much as once smiled: yea that Nec

none of the Saints in Scripture are reported ever to have laughed, Sara
sol^rifisse legitur, quae and Dei voce illi o correpta est.
save Genesis 18.12.
Sara only, Genesis 18.13.
who is presently thereupon also checked for it. Which yet, says that reverend
Father, I speak not (...). Ib.
to abandon laughter, but to bannish looseness.

Thus Chrysostom: which yet is not all out sound or true neither: For did not
Genesis 17.17. and 18.14. Inde Isaak dictus quasi si Gelasium dixeris.
Abraham laugh too as well as Sara? and yet is he not taxed nor rebuked for so
doing; nor indeed was Sara simply rebuked for laughing, but for doubting, yea
if I may say so, for mocking: Admirantis, non dubitantis. Aug. ocut. l. 1.
exultatio gandentis, non irris^o diffidentis. Eucher. in Genes. l. 2. c. 26.
Abraham's laughter, as the Ancients have well observed, proceeded from joy,
Saraes sauoured of distrust. Neither is it at all to the present purpose: For
howsoever Pet. Martyr in Iud. c. 14. Et Guil. Stuck. antiq. co^^iu. l. 3. c 23.
some have thought that Chrysostom therein should allude to that fable of
Plato before rehearsed and discussed: and Joan. Aquilan. and Dan. Vi^cent.

others have applied that speech of his to the games here questioned; yet in
truth it is apparent that he had an eye to Exodus 32.6. 1. Cor. 10.6, 7.
the Israelites disport, which he there also mentions, by them used at the
worship of the golden Calfe: and that he speaks only (as the sequel of his
discourse plainly shows) of (...), etc. Chrysostom. ibid.
Stageplaies and such like as among the Heathen were celebrated in honor of
their Idols; (as De ludis theatralibus l^quitur. Martyr in Iud. c. 14.
some also of the same Authors themselves well observe) which indeed may be
well termed a devilish invention both as they then used them, and as they are
used at this day; as also that grave father to the same purpose further says,
that the Diabolus in vtbibus theatra extruxit. Chrysostom. ibid.
Devil was the first Builder and Founder of Theaters. And surely some good
ground there was for Chrysostom to fetch the pedigree of Stageplaies from him,

ever and anon in honor of his Idols enjoined them and called for them. But
for dice and tables both Plato and the counterfeit Cyprian speak without
ground, the one professing but to tell a tale, the other pretending to relate a
true story, but an idle one, and one as improbable as the other. Howsoever I
deny not, but as the Apostle terms some heresies 1. Tim. 4.1.

wrangling Sophistry (for so I suppose his meaning is) a Devilish device: so
the abuse of these games, in regard of such impieties as accompany it, may
well be termed, as some have termed it, Haec ars m^nd^ciorum, ^periurioru^,

Dicers may well be marshalled among the flock of his followers.

12. Thus then have we examined two of the Fathers produced in this point, and
have found the one to be a forger and the other forged: the one a counterfeit
pretending to be him whom he is not; the other having that fathered on him that
indeed is not to be found in him.

There remains one other only of the ancients, though one not very
ancient, and that is Bernard; Pics Christianos Hier^solymis ale^^ detestari.
Bern. etc. Dan. do lud. al. c. 8.
reported to write, that the godly Christians at Jerusalem detested the use of
these games.

But let Bernard speak out, and he will speak little to the point. Sca^cos
and aleas detestantur: abhorrent vena^ionem: nec ludicra illa auiu^^ rapina, vt
assolet, del^ctantur. Ber^. ad m^lit. templ. c. 4.
Chesse and Dice, says he, they detest: hunting they abhor: hauking, as the
manner is, they take no delight in. And again, Viuitur plane absque vxoribus
and absque liberis in Euangelica perfectione. Bern. ibid.
They live altogether without wines or children, in an Evangelical, or Angelos
terre^os, imo coeli ciues c^stit^s facit. Bern. de diverse. sermon. 3^. and in
Cant. ser^. 27.
Angelical perfection, as at other times he terms it. So that he joins
Chesse and Dice together, as Poenitentiam Episcopo ob scaccoru^ vsum iniunxit

some others also do passing the same sentence upon either: the one whereof
the Author that cites him, approves, nor does he utterly condemn the other.
And he says that as well Hunting and Hauking as gaming are alike abhorred of
them. To be brief he speaks of the Ad Milites Te^pli.
Knights of the Temple, a company of persons retired from the world and worldly
things, addicted to a monkish course of life, restraining themselves from the
lawful use of the good ordinances of God, and affecting a superstitious and
more austere manner of carriage then God or his word has tied any man unto.
Their example therefore as it is no precedent to others, so it is no prejudice
to any that shall swarne from the same.

13. From the ancient Fathers pass we on to Profanos homines audiamus, qui

by dicing and drinking and other riotous courses he had suddenly wasted and
made away all those ample spoils, that upon Pompey the Greats fall had come
into his hands; his excess being such and his prodigality so great, that it
was able soon to consume the riches of whole realms. Who so reads but the
places shall easily see, what Tully condemns in either of them and their crew.

But does Tully therefore utterly condemn all use of Tables or Dice? Nothing
less. He allows elsewhere the use of them Homines labor quotidiano

ad tesseras conferunt, aut etiam no^um sibi aliquem excogi an^ in otio ludum.

so that they dote not upon them and so grow excessive in them, as some do
upon tennis and other exercises sometimes. But in more special manner he
deemeth them very fit recreations, as Martyr in Iud. c. 14.

privately to play with his familiar friends in his own house as well at
Tennis as at Tables; and bearing the Emperor Theodorike also sometime company
at that game; whose civil and moderate and courteous demeanor at the same in
one of his Epistles he thus very wittily describes: Horis meridlanis vir^
tabula cordi est: tesseras colligit rapide, inspi^it solicit, volit argu^^,
mittit instanier, ^oculanter compellat, patienter expe^^at; in bonis iactibus

transit oppositas: sine motu cuaditur, sine colludio ^uadit. Putes illum and in
calculis arma tractare: solae est illi curae viucendi. Sidon. lib. 1. epist. 2.
At afternoon hours often he betaketh himself to Tables: the Dice he catches
up nim^lie; vieweth warily, shakes cunningly, casts speedily; calls for
his chance merrily, and expects it as patiently: in good casts he is silent,
at evil ones he smileth; he is angry with neither, he carries himself
wisely in either: a good chance he scorneth either to fear or to make: the
opportunity whereof he refuses when it is offered him, he lets pass when
it goes against him: he is neither moved if he be defeated, nor uses couine
to defeat: he behaueth himself at game, as if he were at his weapon; his care
is all how to win. Cum ludendum est, regiam sequestrat tant^sper s^ueritatem.
H^rtatur ad ludum, libertatem, communionemque: dicam quod sentio, times ti^eri:

While he is at play, he sets aside his royal state: he inuiteth those be
plaieth with, to froliknesse, and freedom, and fellowlike behavior: to speak
as I think, he is afraid to be feared: in a word, he loves to see them
moved, whom he has beaten in play, scarce believing but that they played booty,
if they be not thoroughly angry. And having told how that often many obtain
suites at game of him by watching and taking their time; Tunc ego etiam aliquid
observaturus f^eliciter vin^or, quando mihi ad h^c tabula perit, vt causa
saluetur. Ibid.
I my self, says he, also when I have a suite to him, am sometime luckily
beaten by him, and am well content to loose my game to him, that I may gain my
suite of him.

14. But to return to our task: Babingt. on Command. 8.
Augustus, say they, got by his dicing a reproach never dying, even to be
counted a dissolute man: and S^^^^nius scribit hoc idem pro summo vitio in
summo and alias op^i^^ illo principe ^abitum fuisse, ad^o vt magnis illius
virtut^bus foed^m aleae labem asperserit. Dam. de l^d. al. c. 7.
it was reputed a notorious vice in him who was otherwise both a very great,
yea and a very good Emperor; but this infamous blot bleamished all his other
great virtues.

Su^tonius indeed reports that Augustus was Nota^us est ^t ^lea indulgens
Suet. Aug. c 71.
taxed by diverse for his common dicing; and a rhyme thereupon made of him to
this effect; Postquam bis class victus naues perdidit; Aliquando vt vincat,
l^dit assidue al^am.
At sea twice beaten, and his ships lost twice;
To win yet once, all day he plays at dice.

Suetonius, and so Casaub. ad Su^ton. and Greg. T^los. syntag. l. 39. c. 3. 8.
others, seem withal to excuse him in part, alleging, that he played simply
and openly for delight alone, and that even in his old age too. But Prima

he was Nosquinquat^ijs satis iucunde egimu^: lusimus enim per omnes dies: ego

somewhat too profuse, and spent more at play then was meet, though
Quadring^nis in punctum H.S. aleam lusit Nero. Suet. Ner. c. 30.
nothing to that, that some of them did, that succeeded him: and partly that he
used game Ac praeterquam Decembri mense, alijs quoque fos^i^ professisque

some other also of his Successors did, in bestowing usually that time on his
sports, that other serious affairs might more justly have laid claim to. This
was taxed in him, not the game it self simply.

Again, Claudius stolidi ingenij indicium maxim ex eo dedit, quod aleae ludo
sum delectaretur. Dan. de lud. al. c. 7.
Claudius, say they, was hereby especially noted to be of a dull and sottish
disposition, because he took so much delight in Tables and Dice.

Claudius is indeed noted to have been Aleam fludiosessime lusit: de cuius

and used to play by the way as he rode in his Coach, having the Tables so
fastened to the seats, that the men might not mingle and the game be marred:

should be put in hell to this penance, Alea ludere p^rtuso fritillo. Senec.

to take his dice up with a box that had an hole in the botome, and so made him
still loose his labor. But I find not where his bent and study that way is

The Dice were indeed by Phraartes King of Parthia sent to Demetrius, who had
sometime bin King of Syria, and a valiant man, as the Parthians well knew,
having been Com multis congressionibus victor fuisset, repent circumuentus

often beaten by him; but then, surprised by a train, was prisoner in Parthia;
where though honorably used, yet desirous of liberty, having twice attempted
to break away, and being twice brought back again, he had these Dice sent
him, not to tax him of sloth, or for tending such toys, but Talis a^eis in

a present to another: as we read in Holinshead in Henry 5.
our own stories, that the Dolphin of France sent a tun of Paris-bals
sometime to Henry the fifth, though without just cause, and with no great good
success: yet would not that prove the use of the one to be evil or unlawful,
no more then this does the other. It is indeed an unseemly thing and a great

16. In the last place are Poets produced for the condemning of dice. And Poets
indeed, Satyrists especially, are the common scourges of the vices and abuses
of their times. Neither is it my purpose to be either a Pandar to any sin, or
a Proctor to plead for it, to excuse or extenuate, much less to justify or
acquit any abuse used in game: (let my tongue first cleave to the roof of my
mouth, nay let it rather rot to the very root in my mouth, then that I should
once attempt ought in that kind;) but to consider only of these games pared
from such abuses, as men may, if they will, and I doubt not but many do, use
them. But let us hear what these Poets say.

Babington Command. 8.
The Poet puts it among the common Canckers that consume men and make
Beggars of them, Dic^, Wine, and Women.

When I first read this, I remembered indeed (...). Antholog. l. 1. c. 57.
a Greek Epigram wherein Baths, Wine, and Women, are joined together as
Canckers corrupting and consuming men's bodies, and making a speedy dispatch of
their lives: which Balnea, vina, Venus corrumpunt corpora nostra: R^stituant
(alij, Conseruant) eadem ^alnea, vina, Venus.
some turning into Latin, to mend the matter, add withal, that these may as
well prove restoratiues or preservatives as canckers and corrasiues, being used
and taken as they ought.

Since I find in some obscure Authors somewhat near that which is alleged,
of dice, wine, and women: Which admitted for authentical, yet does no more
enforce an absolute and general condemnation of dice, then it does of the
other two, wine and women, that are therein joined therewith; which no wise man
or in his right wits will therefore utterly condemn. And yet can there not be
more said in that kind of this one, then (I say not Poets alone, but) the
Spirit of God it self says, (not to press ought out of the Dives eram dudum,

Yea but another Dan. de lud. al. c. 7.

one of our own Poets Chaucers Pardoner, and the like has his Parson.
Chaucer says;

In a word Babington ibid.
it is a wonder taking any Author Christian or Heathen almost in a man's hands,
if a man find not something in him against dicing.

Here is nothing but that which I willingly yield to; and indeed nothing at all
to the point or the purpose.

For first, do not all those Authors and all these authorities impugn and
condemn N^w comes hazardrie with his appurt^nanc^s, as tables and raff^s.
Chaucers Parson.
Tables and Dice as well as bare bones? How is it then that the Citers of them
sever these games, and allowing the one sort, allege these testimonies
against the other sort, which equally concern either?

Again what one of those Heathen or Christian writers was ever either so
scrupulous or so censorious, that either of conscience he utterly forbear all
such games himself, or condemned them in all others besides himself?
Themselves evidently show what they misliked and condemned in them, (in such
places especially where they Est Alea effre^nata q^aeiam idend^^^ p curiam

the wastfulnesse of expense at them; which no man defends. But that is
nothing to the game it self. For for any man to spend more time then is fit
about it, or to wast himself and his wordly estate at it, it is no way
warrantable either in that, or in any other recreation, though never so
warrantable, allowable, yea or commendable otherwise.

Lastly what book shall a man lightly lay his hand on, but he shall find
somewhat in it against drinking, as well as against dicing? yea more by much
against that then against this, if that be true that one says, that Aleae

none ever before himself Poet, Orator, or Philosopher did ever directly and
professedly deal against dice. Yet does not the one prove that all sorts of
men condemn drink: no more then does the other that all sorts of men detest
dice.

Syrus. Nonne sa^is improbata est artis exercitatio, qua quanto quisque ^octior,

the Heathen man, the better the worse. And Babingt. ibid.
if a man, says Sir Thom. Eliot.
one of our Countrymen, hear one to be a Dicer, and know him not, he by and
by judges him to be a light and a vain person, and of no credit or account.

And no marvel. For to be a Dicer imports an habit, a profession, a
practice, a trade: and to make a trade or a practice, or a man's living of any
recreation is not commendable, though the recreation it self be such. But it
is one thing to play at dice or cards, and another thing to be a Dicer or a
Carder: as it is one thing to drink wine, and an other thing to be a (...).

a common trade of them; which to do is most base, and a course not by
Christians only but by Heathens also, indeed generally condemned.

To conclude for this argument, I condemn willingly as much as any of the
Authors produced do: But no one of them all condemn that which they do that
allege them, and therefore they nothing at all concern that for which they
allege them.

Yea to retort the argument applied to the present purpose. Were this problem
propounded, not whether it were lawful for men to use dice; but whether it
were not as lawful for children to play at even and od, as at chery-pit, or at
heads and points as at Push-pin, or at cross and pile as at Spain-counter; I
suppose there is none of the Authors formerly alleged either Heathen or
Christian, but would judge it to be a question moved only in jest, and scarce
worthy to be answered in good earnest. And yet is it not made a question only
whether such childrens sports be lawful, but it is put out of question that
they are utterly unlawful, by those that condemn simply all lusorie Lots,
whom we deal with principally in this point. Who had therefore need to see to
it, that the grounds be good and sure which they build upon in condemning of
that which scarce any Heathen or Christian ever made scruple of before them.

17. But yet there is somewhat further pressed and enforced upon this last
ground: For first, say some, Philip. 4.8.
All things of evil report are to be banished and abolished. But Alea turpis.

cards and dice, as appears, are things of evil report: and therefore ought
among Christians to be utterly abandoned.

I answer: the immoderate use or abuse of them is of evil report, Vt probes
alique^ esse lusorem, non sufficit probare quod aliquando luse^it, sed
requiritur vt sit consuetus. Ios. Mascard. de probat. vol. 2. concl. 997.

the moderate and sober use of them is not. See his Majesty's Counterblast: and
Syluesters Tobacco battred.
To be a Tobacconist or a common Tobacco-taker is a matter of no great good
report: yet is not the seasonable and profitable use of it in that regard
therefore to be utterly abandoned and abolished: nor those reverend Divines,
that, beside others, find benefit by it, to be restrained of their Christian
liberty in that kind.

Secondly, Fennor of recreations prope finem, reas 3.
We shall confirm others, that abuse them, by our use of them. We ought
indeed to be wary that we give as little advantage that way as may be. But by
a discreet and moderate usage of them we shall rather teach them how they may
use that well, which they will hardly be wholly weaned from; and shall make it
plainly appear, that Vitia hominum, non rerum. Senec. epist. 51.
the faults pretended are not the things but the men's, Res non sunt in vitio,
sed vsus rerum. Joan. Saruber policrat. l. 5. c. 17.
not in the Creature it self used, but in man's corruption abusing it.

Thirdly, Fennor of recreations, prope fi^em, reas. 1. and 2.
It cannot but give scandale to those that condemn these games both within the
Church and without it: which R^m 14.15, 16. 1. Cor. 10.32.
in things indifferent ought not to be done.

For those without, there is little fear of offense to be given by the sober
and seasonable use of them. We heard before what they condemned. For those
within the Church, it is true indeed, that R^m 14.21.
it is not good to do ought whereby a weak brother may be offended; yea Romans
14.20.
to do ought with offense it is evil. And therefore Romans 14 13. 1. Cor. 8 9,
etc.
men shall do well to forbear them among those that are diversely minded, and
may therefore be scandalized and greiued therewith. But withal those that are
otherwise minded, Romans 14.2, 3, 4, 15.
ought not to be so peremptory in censuring and condemning those that use them,
or that herein differ in judgment from them: neither ought they to take
offense at them for the doing of that which they know to be held lawful and
approved by many others learned and religious; being condemned or questioned
but by a few in comparison; especially being no maine point or matter of faith.

18. Yea but lastly, Eastie histor. Gosp. reas. 7.
This difference among the learned cannot but make men doubt, and R^m. 14 23.
to use them doubtingly is a sin.

I answer: first, this consequence simply and generally granted will infer
greiuous inconveniences, and drive men into strange straights. For if a man may
do nothing about which there is any difference among the learned, how many
matters will be utterly cast and cut off, which yet no man now condemns other
for the doing, being of the same mind and judgment with himself? yea what a
troop of dilemmaes shall men continually be encountered and entangled withal,
wherein they shall be at a stand, able to take neither part, when yet they must
needs be on some side, some holding it a sin to do a thing, others a sin
not to do the same, as it falls out in diverse controversies both between
the Separatists and our Ministers, and between our own Ministers among
themselves.

Secondly, difference among the learned is not generally just cause of doubt:
in two cases especially it is not; First, where a man discovers evidently the
weakness of their grounds that defend the aduers part.

Secondly, where a man finds sure ground for the one side, which he
therefore sticks close unto.

How many maine points are there in the body of Divinity, which yet many, no
doubt, yea the most among us, now doubt not of, notwithstanding they find
differences among the learned about them? What Secunda^ nuptias expertis, sieve

the Apostles own constitution incapable of the ministry? May no man
therefore so qualified, without scruple and doubt, undertake that office, nor
execute the same in that regard without sin? Are there not great and many
differences about the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist between
Papists and Protestants? yea was there not much difference, and that with eager
opposition about the same point Visantur scriptae vtriusque de re Sacramentaria.
between Luther and Zwinglius many learned and religious taking part on either
side, and continuing the controversy even to these times? Cannot a man
therefore without wavering, even a plain ordinary Christian, adioyne himself
to either side? yes; doubtless he may, and many questionless do. Difference
therefore among the learned gives good cause of disquisition and discussion,
not necessarily just cause of doubt.

Thirdly, general Faith may stand with some kind of doubting, as Mark 9.24.
special Faith may stand with some kind of wavering. Vise Joan. Nider.
consol. timor. conscient. par. 3 cap. 1. and 12. and 13.
Neither is it every sudden iniection, or idle scruple, or snarling objection,
though a man cannot assoile it, that makes a man's actions unwarrantable unto
him, or brings him within compass of that Apostolic censure, Romans 14.23.
He that doubts is condemned, because he does not, what he does, of Faith:
and whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin. Certitudo moralis compatitur secis

A man may be certain of the lawfulnes of a thing, having sure or sufficient
ground for the same; and yet have some scruple arising in his mind about it
otherways, which he cannot well avoid: as Vise Matthaeum de Cracon. in
rational. divine. operam apud Nider. consolat. tim. consc. par. 3. c. 19.
a man may hold firmly some points of doctrine, as the Articles of his faith,
though he be not able to answer every subtle sophisme that against the same
may be objected. And certainly In Moralibus sine ciuilibus non express
determinatis certitudo probabilis sufficit. Nider. consol. part. 2. c. 13. and
14 and 18. and Gerson de contract.
in civil actions not precisely and expressly determined in the word, a moral
certainety, as some Casuists say well, does suffice to keep a Christian man
from incurring Gods displeasure, having done his best endeavor to inform
himself aright, and resting ready to yield unto any better information. Which
moral certainty, yea and more then it, I see not why it may not be well had
in the present point concerning the use of a lusorious Lot, notwithstanding the
difference among those that be both learned and religious. For the ground
whereof (to return that that here is objected) let thus much alone for the
present be considered: that as W. Bradshaw, qui and id^m habet contra Johnson.

a reverend Minister of our Church now with the Lord, in conference with
certain Separatists sometime well alleged, that It was a sufficient argument
to prove the truth of our ministry in that such wrangling and cauilling
Companions as they were, could not object ought against it, but what might well
and easily be answered: so Probatio quandoque fit eo ipso quod contrarium non
probatur. Accurs. ad Cod. Just. l. 4. tit. 7. leg. 1 and ad lib. 7. tit. 23.
leg. 11. and ad lib. 9. tit. 22. leg. 4.
it may be thought a sufficient warrant for the use of these Lots, in that the
oppugners of them being men so learned, and so well read in Gods word, can say
nothing against them (for by that they do say, when they strive of purpose to
do their best in it, they show what they can say) but what either has been
or may be sufficiently answered by others.

Lastly Vbi dubitatio surgit de aliquo actu an possit licite fi^ri vel omitti,
tutius est omittere quam facere: praesertim vbi factio generaret scandalu^
aliorum. Gerson. contrasecta slagellant.
if any man want good ground for the use of them, or have just cause of doubt,
he were best to forbear them, Romans 14.5.
till he be better assured of sufficient warrant for the use of them; yet
without censuring of others that use them with warrant, seeing more, it may be,
herein, then he as yet does.

CHAP. VIII. Of Cautions to be observed in the use of lusorious Lots.
1. THus having answered the arguments produced by the learned of contrary
judgment against these lusorious Lots, and proved the use of them to be in it
self not unwarrantable: It shall not be amiss, as we did before in the former,
so to annex here some caueats and cautions to be observed in the use of them,
both applying some of the former to this particular; and beside adding some
others, that may meet with such abuses, as to such kind of Lots may be
incident; that so things not unlawful in the right and warrantable use of
them, may not become unlawful to us by our abuse of them.

Lusorious Lots therefore, as all other recreations, are to be used soberly,
seasonably, ingenuously, inoftensiuely, prudently, and religiously.

First, I say, soberly and moderately, and to this purpose 1 Thessalonians. 5.6. 1.

we must not do so, that have learned Christ; if so be we have heard him, and
have been taught of him, as we profess our selves to have been. Christian
religion gives no liberty for such courses at any time, much less at that
time, when we should (if we will aright celebrate the memory of Gods mercy
toward us in Christ) carry our selves most religiously and most conformably to
the life of Christ, we ought therefore to remember both then and at all times,
that recreation to other affairs is but as (...). Plut. Lycurg.
sauce or Delectati^ ad vitam, vt sal ad cibu^. Peccant mulieres cum potaegia
nimis condiunt sale. Barelet. quadra. hebd 4. ser. 2.
salt to our meats: As the use of sauce or salt is to prepare our stomach for
food, or to help our appetite in eating; so the use and end of recreation is
to refresh us after labor, and to make us fit for labor: It is not an
employment that our principal and precious time ought to be spent in; which
was the fault of those both in Esai 5.11, 12, 13.
Esaies days; and in Matt. 24.38, 39.
Noah's time (whom the holy Ghost therefore taxes) that they gave themselves
wholly to their delights and their pleasures, regarding nothing else, and
minding nothing else; like the idle Act. 17.21.
Athenians that applied themselves to naught else but to hear or tell news.
And surely as it is preposterous diet to use (...).
more sauce then meat, and to cloy the stomach with that which should whet up
the appetite: so (...). Aristot. Ethic. Nic. l. 9. c. o Parum de delectatione

it is no less preposterous a course to have the greater part of men's lives
taken up with disport, so that it is a mean to withdraw and withold them
from that, which it ought to fit them for.

The rule therefore is here that Game is to be used as an extraordinary
refreshing, not as an ordinary employment: (...). Arist. Ethic. l. 4. c. 8.

2. For matter of expense likewise is great regard to be had, that we spend no
more then is fit upon them, nor then our estate may well afford to be spent
upon our sports; that in our lawful recreations Fennor of recreat. rul. genesis 5.
we go not beyond our ability; and therefore that either we play without
staking or wagering, or at least without staking and wagering more, then any
man's estate will well permit one of his rank to spend on his lawful
delights, and without disabling of himself to the doing of that which God
requires of him otherwise.

In which regard is such play by reverend Divines justly condemned, B King on
Ion. lect 9.
wherein the matter engaged icapordeth a man's stock or his state. As also the

our laws likewise inhibite any but the richer and better sort the use of
these games and other the like, whereat much may be soon lost, save at
certain times only: thereby to prevent the wretched practice of such, as would
otherwise be continually crumbling away their wealth by the ordinary use of
them: Which for any man to do it is no better then plain stelth. It is to rob
the poor, whom Ephesians 4.28.

whose necessity gives them a right to his wealth: it is to rob his family,
Prou. 17.27.

which not to provide for is made the note of a counterfaite Christian, and one
worse then a professed Infidel: it is to rob himself: and as Solomon says,
Prou. 28.24.
He that robs father or mother, and says it is no sin, is Socius est viro

Cosengerman to a Murderer, or a Destroier: so he that robs himself by
wasting of his own state on such courses, is little better then a murderer or
a destroier. And surely Si omnis qui hominem oc^idit, h^^icid^ est, quisquis

more bitter, then death.

Yet is it lamentable to consider how common abuse is in this kind, both at
these games, and at others, among men of all sorts. Some one great man sometime
at a race, or a sitting, or a match at boules, or an afternoones cock-fight,
casting more away then would have maintained many of honest means in good
estate for a twelue-moneth and more: so that by means hereof not the poor
alone remain vnreleiued, and ^simplexne suror sestertia cent^m Perdere, and
horr^nti tunitam non reddere feruo? Iua^nal. sat. 1.
their servants unrewarded, but their rents are so racked and their estates so
improued, that their Tenants that hold of them are thereby also impouerished,
and yet themselves as Genes. 41.21.
Pharaos lean Kine when they had eaten up the fat ones, -quodcunqur profanda
Traxit auaritia, laxa peiere resundit. Claudian. belle Gildon.
never a whit the richer, or better able to do King or Country service, for
all that they have scraped and gathered together in that sort.

And again the poorer sort, on the other side, though they complain of
penury, yet will not be beaten from play: even those that will pretend want, to
shift of the least common charge, yet will make shift to get somewhat wherewith
to hold game: who when they have spent what they had that way, wanting means
to recover ought soon or suddenly again, and being enured to idleness by
such thriftlesse haunts, are enforced ost to betake themselves afterward to
such courses, as bring upon them at length as well loss of life as of living.

But here is a question moved among the learned, whether a man may play for, or
wager ought in play. And it is a question that requires a larger discourse
thoroughly to discuss it, then this present work, growing already too great,
will well permit. Some utterly condemn it: and I have seen of late in writing
M.W on occasion of Sampsons wager. Judge 14.12.
along discourse containing sundry arguments tending thereunto: of which yet (
- ha^c veniam petimusque damusque vicissim. Horat. art poet.
to speak my mind freely, and ingenuously without exception to the Author,
whom I think reverently of otherwise, though in judgment dissenting from him
herein) I am not able to apprehend the force and validity. Neither indeed can
I discern ought that should make it unlawful for a couple of familiar friends
to put it to the event of a game, whether of them shall part with such a trifle
to the other, as either of them may spend lawfully at that present upon his
pleasure, or they might otherwise well freely bestow either on other.

Others therefore allow it, as the Civil law does, in some cases Quod in
conuiuio vescendi causa ponitur, in tam re^ familiam ludere permittitur. C.
lib. 3. tit. 43. leg. 3.
for somewhat presently to be expended and spent in common between them, as
when men play together for the charge of a supper. Yet may men go too far also
that way; as in feasting of friends (a fault in these times too usual) a man
may exceed. It is said of Nabal the Churl that 1. Sam. 26.36.
he made a feast like a King. And as Prou. 23.20, 21.
by feasting a rich man may soon bring himself to poverty, and a poor man to
beggerie: so may either do the same, which some seem to have observed, by
hazarding overmuch to be spent and wasted that way.

For mine own part, I approve the judgment of that reverend Divine who thus
determines this doubt; B. Babington on command. 8.
When so little is played as no way disableth a man to any duty of his calling,
or the money, being not much, is bestowed in some meeting for the maintenance
of love, or that which is won is a reward appointed for the exercise, (bestowed
by such as may well be at that charg) then I think with Idem ex part Danaeus de
lado ale^ c. 4. and Perkins cases of Conscience book 3. chap. 4. 3. Quest. 2.
others, that it is not unlawful.

So that the rule is here that nothing be hazarded but what may very well be
spared, and what a man may expend lawfully at that present on his lawful
delight.

3. And thus may we keep within compass for the measure or quantity both of
time and expense. Now Ludendi modus quidam retinendus est, vt ne nimis omnia
profundamus, elatique voluptate in turpitudiuem dilabamur. Cicer offic. l. 2.
for the manner of using game further consideration would be had. For therein
also many offend, when they are too eager upon play, or are overmuch
transported and carried away with delight in it; when, as one well says, Fennor
of recreat. ^^legener. 3.
they either 1 Thessalonians. 5.6.
sleep at it, or are drunk at it: that is, when it either so occupies men's
minds that it makes them vnwatchfull against the motions of finne, or so
overcomes them with the delight of it, or other passions procured by it, that
it makes them break forth into outrage of swearing, blaspheming, fretting,
cursing, and quarelling, and such courses as sobriety in such cases would never
admit. For Esai. 51.21. Ebriae, non a vino. Est and absque tem^to temulentia

music are said to make men little better: So we may well say that men are
drunk with game, when they are so addicted thereunto, that it stirs up in
them such distempered passions as men soberly minded cannot but condemn and
ab^orre, and which they themselves could not but dislike in themselves, if they
were not for the present besides themselves.

As therefore it is well advised by one, that Cauept totus aliquando dormias,
Bern. de ordin. vitae.
Men at no time give themselves wholly to sleep: so much more have we good

we set not our minds at any time wholly upon play, and so sleep waking at it,
(the more dangerous sleep of the twain) nor suffer our affections to be
overmuch carried away with it, least we become no less daungerously drunk
therewith then some other are with wine or strong drink. For as Luke 21.34.
worldly cares, so Luk 8.14.
bodily pleasures, and Game among others, though not evil simply in
themselves, yet become spiritually prejudicial and dangerous unto us, when our
hearts are either wholly possessed with them, or ouer-eagerly and earnestly
addicted unto them.

In this kind especially (...). Plut. symp. prob. l 7. c. 7.
to exceed is the rather discommendable, because the business it self (if it
may be so termed) is but light, being but matter of recreation and ordinary
delight: and it is (...) Is^er. ad Dem^nic.
no less an imputation for a man to be over serious in trifling matters, then
to trifle in serious and weighty affairs.

The rule then is here that Flecte ^ruces anim^s, vt vere ludere possis.

content to win or to loose at them, and stand indifferent to conquer or to be
conquered by them, and to go well through with or to be crossed in them, as it
shall fall out: our affections being no further fixed upon or fastened to them,
then the weight and worth of them may well warrant.

4. Secondly recreations are to be used as soberly, so seasonably. For Eccles.
3.1. (...) and (...) quod ex Pittaci sententia ((...) apud Laert) Auson. (...),
tempus vt noris iubet: Sed (...) iste ^^mpesti^um tempus est. (...). Man.
Palaeol ad fill. praecept. 6. (...). Theogu - (...). Sodamus in anthol.
there is a time and season for all things, and for recreation among other
things. Eccles. 3.4.
There is a time, says Solomon, for laughing, and mirth, and a time for
dancing and delight. There are times for recreation and sport, and times for
sad and serious affairs. Recreation therefore is good when it is seasonable,
when it comes in his due time: else, as it is with fish and foul when they
come out of season, (...). Menand. H (...). Idem. Tempestina aliqua ni voluptas

hand datumsuo. Erasmus chil. 4. cent. 3. adag. 2. Et data non apto tempore vina
nocent. Ovid. remed. l. 1.
that is evil, that is good otherwise.

Herein then men offend, not only when they take up too much time with it, but
when they take not fit times for it. For a man may spend too much time at it,
and then he sins in using it immoderately: and again he may spend but
little, yet not fit time about it, and then he sins in using it
unseasonably. Now then do men use game and recreation unseasonably, when they
should and ought to be otherwise employed, either in the works of their
special callings, or about the holy things of God.

First, when they should be about any necessary duty concerning their estate
and place, or the means of their maintenance, and the good of themselves and
theirs. In which regard was not that parties course commendable that says,
Posthabui tamen illorum me^seria ludo^ Virgil, bu^ol. Ecl. 7.
he neglected his own business to attend others at play: nor can those be
justified that either sit at cards and tables within doors, or be in the
bouling alley abroad, when other affairs of great consequence require their
presence elsewhere. Since the use and end of recreation is not to withdraw or
withold us from our more serious employments; but Vt tempestiua laboris
intermissione ad laborandum vegetiores reddamur. Valor. Max. memor. l. 8. c. 8.
to make us fitter for them, and better able to go through with them. (...).

As peace is the end of war; and peace is aimed at in war; so (...). Arist.

war is peace, so the maine end of peace is not so much the taking of our
pleasure, (though Z^ch. 3.10. and 8.5. and 9.17.
we enjoy that benefit also thereby) as the freedom of following our serious
affairs. The time therefore that ought to be employed in the one, must not be
unseasonably misspent in the other. N^que enimita generati a natura ^umus, vt ad

Our vacant time only is allowed for disport: which is then most seasonable,
as food, when hunger craves it, or as sleep, when heaviness after watching
calls for it, so when wearisomenesse after other employments requires it.

Secondly, when they should be tending the holy things of God either in public
or private. And thus Ludo Sabbatum viela^ur. Alex. Carpent. destruct. vit. par.

as the Popish sort are noted ordinarily to solemnize their festiuals. For this
is not Exodus 20.8. Esai 58.13.
to sanctify or consecrate the Sabbath as holy to the Lord. The Sabbath indeed
is a day of rest, but Leuit. 23.3. and Exodus 31.15. (...). Ignat. ad Magn^s.
of holy rest; of rest not to worldly recreations but to heavenly meditations,

of rest to religious and spiritual employments. It is sacrilege therefore to
follow game on the Sabbath; at such time as we should be plying the service
and worship of God: it is time stolen from God that we spend so on our sports:
Which it were less sin therefore for us to spend (...). Aristot. Ethic. l.
10. c. 6.
on some more serious affairs, according to that which one of the ancients
well say, that M^lius ^st (Dic Sabbati) a^are quam salta^^. Aug. in Psalm. 91.
Melius tota die f^d^rent quam tota di^ laderent. Idem in Psalm. 32. Melius

3. Hoc. quoque proculdubi^ B. August. verbu^ Christianis Ecclesiae festi^itates

decalog. mand. 3.
It were better for a man (in such manner) on the Sabbath to plough then to
play, and to dig and delue then to dance all day. For the lighter the occasion
of sinning is, where all other things are equal, the greater the sin is.

Yea and those also that on other days wast that time this way, which they
ought to spend either in their own private and personal devotions, or in
instruction of their families and performance of holy duties with them, are not
herein to be justified no more then the former: the one turns it to sin as
well as the other, in neglecting of that duty for the following of their own
pleasure, that Deuteronomy. 6.7. Ephesians. 6.4.
God himself has enjoined them, and will one day require of them.

So that the rule is here, that That time alone may be spent in play, which we
have free from other, serious and religious, affairs.

5. Thirdly, recreation must be used ingenuously, freely and liberally: Sperne
lucrum: versat mentes vesana libido. Pallad. Lusori cupido semper grauis exitus
instat. Basil. schol. in catalect.
not with any greedy desire of lucre and gain. For recreation is no trade or
course of life, for a man to make a living of or to live by: As Ludendo non
ludere sed perdere. Cod. lib. 3. tit. 43.
it is not playing, but spending when men wast themselves that way: so (...).
Alexander Mag. apud Pl^t. in apo^th. non ludere, sed illudere, quod ali^ sensu
de Canir Seneca sup. non ludere, sed latronem and prado^e^ agere. Astesa^. in
sum. lib. 5. tit. 30.
it is not playing with, but preying upon those we seem to play with, when by
such courses we pill them and make a spoil of them. It is to alter the very
nature of the thing it self, to make a trade and a traffic of disport and
pastime; to make not a lusorious, but a serious Let of it; yea more then a
serious, Vt vere sorts essent, and fata tenta^entur: quod de Heliogabali
sortibus Lamprid. See the example of him that hanged himself in Trinity Coll.
Hall, where he had lost his money at game the night before, in Trauers on
Psalm. 111. Ita hae nugae seria ducunt In mala. - Hor. art.
a sad and an heavy Lot (as it often falls out) of that Finis ludi debitus,
non propter cupiditat^m, sed propter recreationem and socialitat^m. Astesan in
sum. l^ 5. tit. 30.. 1.
which should be merely for recreation and delight. Thou make thy self both
a Sinner, whosoever thou art, in so doing, by taking that from thy brother,
that neither he ought to part with, nor thou to receive; and a Partner also
with him in his sin, whereby he mispendeth, or hazardeth the mispending of
that, which he ought otherwise to employ.

But it is not lawful at all then, may some say, for a man to receive any
gain, or live in any wise by Game?

I answer in some kind, and in some case it may, and that either ordinarily or
extraordinarily.

Ordinarily those may be said to live lawfully by Game, whose trades and
professions are employed in whole or in part in making, providing, selling, and
uttering such instruments or other furniture as are used commonly in Game, as
Bowyers, and Fletchers, and Turners, and Dice-caruers, and Card-makers, and
Haberdashers of small wares: For if the games themselves be lawful, Nimis ergo
rigidi, qui peccati reos peragu^t omnes re^um e^usmodi aut mercatores aut
artifices. Antonin. sum. pa^. 2. tit. 1. c. 23.. 14. and alij. Cautius paulo
aequiusque ex Gabr. Biel super 4. sent. Guil. Pepin. de confess. tract. 2 p. 3.
c. 6.
the callings are not unlawful whereby men are set on work to provide
necessaries for the same, which could not otherwise so commonly, or so
conveniently be had.

Extraordinarily a man may sometime also by the Game it self receive gain; as
thus: Suppose a man of good wealth either being evil at ease or otherwise
desirous to recreate himself, calls in a poor man from his trade or his
work that he is otherwise employed in, to accompany him in his game, which he
cannot use without company; it is not unlawful for the poor man so
accompanying the rich, to receive some gain from him, as a reward of his
employment with him, and in liew of that loss, which he sustaineth by
intermitting of his own work. But among equals, or others ordinarily, that
play together for mutual recreation and delight, for the one to enrich, or to
desire to enrich himself by the others damage and loss, (...). Ar^st. t.
Ethic. Nicom. l. 4. c 1.
it is a note of a base and an illiberall disposition, and against the nature
of disport, which ought to be free.

The Rule then is here, that (...). Plut. symp. probl. l. 7 c. 7. Neque enim
ludus est, vbi census volnitur in tabula, and ludus fit de periculo, and de
ludo periculum, vt Ambr. de Tob. c. 11.
Play be used as play; for pleasure, not for profit; for game not for gain:
and as no man therefore ought to wast his precious time or his estate thereat,
and to buy his recreation at so dear a rate as were the expense and loss of
either; so neither ought any man to seek or desire by play to increase or
advance his estate, or to make a prey and a spoil of him that he plaieth with.

6. Fourthly recreation must be used inoffensiuely, or Fennor recreat. rule
genesis 2.
without offense. For if 1. Cor. 10.31, 32.
in all things regard is to be had hereunto, then in recreation also among the
rest: if Ibid and Romans 14.20.
in eating and drinking matters of more and greater necessity, then much more
in things lighter and of less weight, as being matter of mere delight only,
which may otherways also well be had.

Now the offense that may be given by game is either general or special;
public or private; in regard of our superiors or in regard of our equals.

Public offense may be given to the Laws and State we live under by common
use of Fennor of rec^eat. rule spec. 2.
such Games as are by the Law made unlawful. See Field of the Church, book 4.
chap. 32, 33, 34.
For howsoever it be true indeed that positive Laws, as they are such, do not
simply bind the conscience, nor alter the nature of things lawful and
indifferent in themselves; yet Quamuis peccet quis transgrediendo l^ges
humanas, tamen non ligant ^oscientiam: pat^t per simile de praeceptis
medicorum, quae d^spicere quis non potest s^ne peccato, and tamen non ligant
conscientia^. Gerson de vita spirit. lect. 4. cor^l. 5.
may men by the breach of them become guilty of sin in Gods sight, where
they restrain for good and wholesome ends the use of things even indifferent,
partly through contempt of supreme Romans 13.1.2. Tit. 2.1.1. Pet. 2.13, 14
authority enacting them; and partly also through hindrance of the public
utility aimed at in them: which is either of them severally, (much more both
of them jointly) sufficient to make a man stand guilty of sin against God.

The like is to be said of those that live in such Churches where the use of
some particular Games is held unlawful or inhibited; 1. Cor. 11.16. and 14.33.
Quod neque contra fidem, neque contra bonos mores iniungitur, in lifferenter
est habendum, and pro little inter quos viuitur, societate seruandu^ est. Aug.
epist. 118. c. 2, Cum Roman venio, ieiuno Sabbato; cum hic sum, no^ ieiuno: sic
etiam tu, ad quam for^e Ecclesiam v^^eris, eius morem seruae, si cuiquam non
vis esse scandalo, ne^ quenquam tibi. Ambrosius olim Augustino, qu^d and ipse
pro coelesti oraculo suscepisse se ait ibid. Faciat quisque quod in ca Ecclesia
in quam venit, inue^^rit. Aug. ibid. c. 5. Vise and cundem de d^ctr. Christ. l
3. c. 13.
every one being bound Contra rationem nemo sobrius contra Scripturas nemo
Christianus, contra Ecclesia^ nemo pacificus senserit. Aug. de Trin. l. 4 c. 6.
Ego m^lim dic^re, secerit, vel, faciendum censuerit.
for peace and quietness sake to conform himself in things indifferent to the
Church he lives in.

As also of those that live under the ministry of such Pastors as are of a
contrary judgment in this point: the Apostle requiring Christian men not to
(...). Hebr. 13.17.
obey them only, but to yield unto them that have the over sight of them, and
that watch over them for their souls safety; that is, not only to be ruled
by them for necessary duties, and such as they shall be able to convince them
of by the evidence of Gods word; but to be over ruled also by them in matters
of indifferency, when they shall deem somewhat unlawful that may well be
forborne, though either the grounds of such judgment of theirs be
insufficient, or their people be not thoroughly convinced of the same.

Neither ought children or servants to take liberty to themselves for the use
of such games, as their parents or masters under whose government they are,
shall think good to restrain and to inhibite in their houses; where the Law
both of Ephesians. 6.1, 5. Colos. 3.20, 22.
God and man has given them a power of command: the breach whereof therefore
may cause guilt of sin even in Gods sight.

So that the rule here is, that Men be content to be restrained in matter of
game for the ordinary use of it, by the Church and State they live in, by the
Pastor they live under, or by the Master they serve with.

Now as offense may be given publicly or generally to those, that we live
under or among, so may offense be given also to those, that we converse with
in private. For which cause therefore are these games to be forborne in some
cases in regard of our brethren, that either making scruple and doubt of them,
or being persuaded in judgment of the unlawfulness of them, may there-through
either offend with us, or be offended at us. For Fennor of recreat rule genesis 4.
and spec. 3.
that is not indifferent, that is done with offense: since 1. Cor. 10.32, 33.
we ought not unnecessarily to give offense unto any; but Romans 15.1, 2.
to seek to please others as well as our selves, and that now and then even 1.
Cor. 10.33.
with displeasing of our selves; doing that therein for them, that Romans 15.3.
Christ once did for us. And therefore, Romans 14 21.
it is not good, says the Apostle, to eat flesh or drink wine, or to do
ought whereby thy brother may stumble, or be offended, or be weakened. And
undoubtedly, if R^m 14.20.
it be evil for a man, when he eats with offense; then it is no less evil
to him, when he gameth with offense.

Now in this kind we may offend two ways.

First when we cause others to sin, and so to offend with us, not by
partaking with us in sin, but by partaking with us in that, which though it
be no sin in it self, yet Romans 14 22, 23
is it a sin unto them, because they hold it to be such. For Romans 14.14.
to him that holds a thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean; and him
therefore 1. Cor. 8.7.
it de^ileth in the doing of it or dealing with it. 1. Cor. 8.9, 10, 11, 12.
Whereas then by thy practice thou encouragest such an one to do the like to
that thou do, as is unresolved in the point, thou laiest a stumbling block
before him, who either Leuit. 19.14. Deuteronomy 27.8.
for dimnesse of sight discerns it not, or Heb. 12.12, 13.
for weakness of limme auoideth it not, and so by occasion of thy default
stumbleth and falls.

Secondly when we cause others to be offended at us, and to think evil of us,
as being such as make no conscience of our courses; because we use that which
they supposing to be sin, suppose withal that we cannot but see to be sin.
For (...). Clem. Alex. in pro^r^pt.
it is the common guise of most men to think that every one should see
presently what themselves once apprehend. To give offense therefore in this
case in this kind, it is a wrong to our selves, in causing others though
iniustly and undeservedly to think evil of us, and Romans 14.16. 1. Cor. 10.28,
29, 30.
making our commodity and Christian liberty to be evil spoken of. A thing not
to be lightly regarded of us, what other, our brethren especially shall think
of, or speak by us: since Eccl. 2.1. (...)
a good name is, as the holy Ghost says, better then a good ointment; and
Proverb. 22.1. (...)
a good report desirable above riches and much treasure. Yea considering that

the efficacy of the agent consists much in the disposition of the patient:
and that It is hard therefore, as a D. Hall medit. 99. cent. 1.
worthy Divine of ours well observes, for a man ever to do good on others,
unless he be reputed good himself: we have great cause even in this regard
also to be wary and careful Romans 12.17. 2. Cor. 8.21 cauens and tibi a
peccato, and illis a scandalo. Bernard. de tempor. sermon. 74. (...). Clem. Alex.
p^edag. lib. 3. c. 11.
as well of keeping our credit good with men, as our conscience clear to God,

as well our name and fame unstained in regard of the one, as our hearts and
hands untainted in regard of the other. Otherwise, Conscientia necessaria est

if relying wholly upon the one we grow careless of the other, we shall in so
doing deal, not only cruelly and uncharitably as concerning our brethren, but
unwisely also and inconsiderately as concerning our selves. It is a wrong
therefore to thy self, in that Romans 14.16.
thou causest thy self to be evil thought of without cause: it is a wrong to
thy brother, in that Romans 14.10.
thou give him occasion to offend in misiudging of thee. It is a sin Romans
14.13, 14, 15.
against charity; for it is a breach of charity to do that needlessly that may
vex thy weak brothers mind; Romans 14.17, 18, 19.
against peace and concord, giving occasion of vain and needelesse
disagreement; yea even against piety too; for 1. Cor. 8.11.
in offending thy weak brother thou sinnest against Christ; in occasioning him
to stumble and fall, (so much as in thee lies) Romans 14.15, 20. 1. Cor. 8.12.
thou destroiest him that Christ died for. And therefore where thou find
that thy liberty does or may in likelihood offend, there Romans 14.16. 1. Cor.
10.29.
for thine own sake, for R^m 14*13, 15.
thy brothers sake, for Romans 14.1. 1. Cor. 8.7.
his weakness sake, for Romans 14.15, 18.
Christ thy Saviors sake forbear: Romans 14.22.
hold thy faith within thy self; keep thy knowledge to thy self; and say
with 1. Cor. 8.13.
the Apostle, If cards or tables offend my brother, I will never play at them
while the world stands, that I may not offend him.

The rule here is in a word, that It is not lawful to play needlessly before or
with those that hold such games unlawful, and who it is likely will in that
regard take occasion of offense at it.

7. Fifthly our recreations are to be used prudently and prouidently in regard
of our selves, as well as inoffensiuely in regard of others: it being a point
of spiritual wisdom therefore, to forbear the use of such games either in
whole or in part, as either may be, or we have found to be, occasions of sin
to us. For as 1. Cor. 10.23.
the former made them inconvenient, so 1. Cor. 6.12.
this makes them inexpedient, when they may, and so far forth as they may,
endanger us by sin.

In part they are to be forborne in some cases, when not the game it self,
but the manner of it (which yet may be reformed by us) occasioneth the evil.
Where comes to be condemned again that eagerness in game, that we spoke
of before, that playing for great sums, not in regard of it self alone, and
the loss that it brings with it; but further also in regard of those
Substantijs perditis in blasphemias erumpant. C. l. 3. tit. 43.
grievous abuses and enormities that it usually occasioneth men to break forth
into. For let men say what they will, that it is all one to them whether they
win or loose, (as B. King on Ion. lect. 9.
a reverend Prelate of ours yet living, whose words I often willingly use in this
argument, well says,) in such profusion of substance, as the loss cannot but
pinch, so men's passions cannot but be moved, and a troop of wretched sins
commonly ensues, swearing, for swearing, cursing, banning, defying,
heart-burning, quarelling, fighting, spilling of blood, unsupportable sorrows
of heart, cursed despair, selfe-executions, weeds able to blemish and
disgrace the lawfullest recreation that is* wheresoever they be found, as
Diripi^n^que dapes, contactuque omnia ^oedant Immundo. Virg. Aen. lib. 3.
the Harpies defiled the cleanest meats.

Again in some cases these games are in this regard wholly to be forborne. For
where a man shall find his own disposition to be such as he cannot use them
at all ordinarily without much distemper, that he cannot contain himself when
the cards or dice go against him, but that he is ready to break out into
profane and bad language; or that he cannot endure to be beaten at play
without wrath and vexation and disquiet of mind; or though he can at sometime
with somewhat ado suppress his unruly passions and perturbations in this
kind, yet that ordinarily and usually he is overtaken on these occasions, and
in danger therefore to be ensnared and entangled that way; there it is best for
a man In dubijs semita^ debemus eligere tutiorem. Clens. 3. decretal. l. 5.
tit. 12. c. 11. In ambiguis via tutior eligenda. Gersonin reg. m^r.
to take the safer side, and as Job 30.1.
Job made a covenant with his eyes, so to make a covenant with his hands not to
handle cards or dice, which the rule of inexpediencie here strikes out of his
hands.

Yea by the former rule for a man to join in play with those whom he knows
to be such is no less evil unto him, then it were to use it in the like case
himself.

The rule then here is that we use not these games unless we can rest quiet
and content with the event of them: and again, if we can, that we do so use
them, that we may not be tempted to disquiet and discontent thereupon.
Agreeable whereunto are those golden rules of our gracious Sovereign
concerning play to his son; Jacob. Rex (...) lib. 3.
First ere ye play, consider ye do it only for your recreation, and resolve
to hazard the loss of all that ye play; and next, for that cause play no more
then you care to cast among Pages: otherwise if you cannot keep these rules,
my counsel is that all-vtterly ye abstain from these plays: for neither a
mad passion for loss, nor falsehood used for desire of gain can be called play;

8. Sixthly and lastly these recreations are to be used reverently and
religiously, that is, with such due reverence and regard of Gods majesty, and
of his presence and providence, as the nature of the business that we are about
does either exact or admit. For Christian men are to do all things whatsoever
1 Cor. 10 31.
to the glory of God, and Colos. 3.17.
in the name of Christ Jesus, Ephesians. 5.20. 1. These. 5.18.
with thanksgiving unto God: and all their actions are to be 1. Tim. 4.4, 5.
sanctified unto them by the word and by prayer.

Now this Caveat excludes two extremes, Profaneness and Presumptuousnes.
First Profaneness, that we behave not our selves in play profanely and
ungodly: that we so play, that we shut not God out at doors; so play that we
Fr. Marbury on Psalm. 32.
make not the Devil our play-fellow: Remembering that Psalm. 119.1^8.
we play in Gods presence, as well as pray in Gods presence; and that there is
a providence of God watching over us as well while we play, as while we
sleep; yea that Zech. 3.10 and 8.5, 10, 11, 12.
by his goodness we have freedom and liberty as well for our sports and
pleasures and lawful delights, as for other our sager and more serious
affairs: which are therefore as well the one as the other to be used with
acknowledgement of Gods mercy and goodness, and of his gracious providence,
whereby we enjoy them, with freedom and liberty for them, not to the dishonor
of him, from whom we have the free use of them.

Secondly it excludes Presumptuousnes; that howsoever we have an eye unto and
take notice of Gods providence thus in general, yet we take heed how we
attempt to draw down or call in his immediate providence or special presence
in play to stickle between us and those we play with. B. King on Ion. lect. 9.
As that we be not so gross (to use again the words of that worthy Prelate)
on the one side as to make Fortune our Goddess, as assigning good or evil
luck unto her; so that we be not so saucie on the other side, as to call Gods
majesty from heaven (to guide our game, or to further our play, or) to
determine our doubts: for we look not so high in such frivolous and gamesome
quarells, but as we carelessly undertake them, so we follow them as lightly, and
end them as merrily. And therefore to say, as some use, in play; God send me
such a card, or such a chance of the Dice, or, I pray God I may win this or
that game, is too saucie and malapert behavior for any.

But, will some say, may not a man lawfully pray for whatsoever he may wish or
desire? or 1. Tim 4.4, 5.
are not all our actions to be sanctified by prayer? as was formerly said.

I answer: True it is that every action of a Christian man is to be sanctified
by prayer either general or special, but not every action with every sort and
manner of petition or prayer. A man may pray for his recreations, that he may
carry himself (...).
soberly and without offense in them, and that even by them he may be the
better fitted for better things: and such prayer is sufficient to sanctify
them to him conceived either in general or in special, as he finds and
feels his heart affected, and as occasions and circumstances either admit or
require it. This then in game ought to be a man's general desire, which he may
also by prayer lawfully impart to God, if he please. Beside which other again
more particular desires a man may have also in game, as to win rather then to
loose, to overcome rather then to be conquered; neither are such desires
evil, so they be moderate; (for they are idle and frivolous, yea dangerous
where they grow excessive and immoderate, being other then befitteth the nature
of that which they concern) yet are they not such as it is seemly to acquaint
God withal. For the better conceiving whereof consider we thus much: that To
desire is not to pray, but shows what we approve. H Smith in Pilgrims wish.
every desire is not by and by a prayer; albeit every prayer ordinarily import
some desire; neither is every lawful desire a fit matter for prayer. For
prayer is a wish or desire of the heart directed unto God. But many things we
desire and may lawfully desire, which yet are not matters of that moment as may
be fit to acquaint God in particular with our desire of them, or to direct our
petitions in special manner to him for them; much less to expect or require
at Gods hand any special work or help of his for the effecting of them. And
of this kind are those latter sort of desires; of which to say therefore in
game, I pray God I may win, or, I would to God I might have such a card, or
such a cast, is too too much presumptuousnes, and will not well stand with that
reverent respect that each one of us owes to Gods majesty.

The rule then is here, that as we exclude not Gods presence inplay; so we call
not in his providence to further our play. It is one thing to play before the
Prince and in his presence, an other thing Easlie histor. of Gospel.
to call him in to stickle between us at some question about a measuring cast:
So it is one thing to play as before God and in his presence; and another thing
it is to make God our play-fellow, or to call him in to help and further our
game, that which a Christian man may not do.

9. And these be the Cautions that I have thought good to propound for the
limiting and rectifying of the use of these games: Which cautions, I confess,
the most of them are such, as concern game in general, ( Non minus otij quam
negotij^ tio^em ext^re op^rtere. Cato orig. l. 1. Cic. pro Planc. and ad Attic.
l. 1. epist. 2^. Colum de re rust. l. 2. c. 22. Symmach. l 11. ep. 1. and
Sidon. l. 5. ep. 14. (...). Arist. polit. l. 8. c 3. contra quem Galba quo ^
nemo ra^ione^ otij sui reddere cogeretur. Suet. Galb. c 9.
of which as well as of more serious and sad matters either civil or sacred,
account also must be given unto God) and in that regard are not so proper and
peculiar to this particular kind of Lot. Yet I supposed it not amiss to point
at them, and in some sort also to press them: partly that I might not be taxed
and censured as a Pleader for sin and such abuses as are common as well in
these game as in other, by means whereof those that condemn all Lots used in
game simply are wont to take occasion to make them in general more odious: and
partly also that no profane person that abuses any of these or other the like
games, might be able to take any color of advantage by ought that has been
spoken of the lawfulness of the games themselves in themselves simply
considered, to justify his own abuse of them in mispending his time, or
wasting his estate at them, or otherwise inconsiderately and irreligiously
abusing them: which it may be some would have done, had I been silent in this
part, and propounded such Cautions only as the nature of the Lot it self
might seem to require.

Yea but, will some say, had it not been much better to have passed over all
this with silence, knowing your judgment in this point to be such as differs
from diverse very reverend and religious? Or is it not in this case, as Vt
facilius est, ita tu^ius qucque omnes imagines e templis submouere, quam
impetrare, vt nec modus praeterea^ ur, n^c superstiti^ admisceatur. Eras. in
cataches. Non vti, quam non abuti facilius. Tertull. de coron.
one sometime said of Images, an easier matter wholly to take away the use of
them, then to keep them free from abuse?

Hereunto I answer: First, these abuses are common to all kind of game: they
accompany other games as well as these in those that be evil minded and
profanely disposed. And the like therefore in that regard may be said either
of all other games, or of any other particular game, at least in ordinary use.

Secondly, it is true indeed, that where the use and the abuse of a thing are
so enwrapped and entangled together, that they cannot be easily severed the one
from the other, there the use of the thing it self, if it be unnecessary
otherwise, would wholly be abandoned. But in these games the use and the abuse
may, for the most part, (some special dispositions only excepted,) by those
that desire to walk in the fear of God, easily be severed. For as for those
that make no conscience of their courses, they will not be dissuaded from them,
though it be never so evidently discovered unto them in what manner they abuse
them, and by their abuse of them make that evil and unlawful to themselves,
that otherwise were not such in it self. And for those that fear God, they
may with ease as well rectify and sanctify these lusorious Lots to
themselves, as they may any other games of the like use, and as easily sever
them from such abuses as are commonly committed in them, as they may other
disports, as draughts, and boules and the like, that are commonly used and
generally allowed.

Thirdly, though many godly dissent, yet, I am sure, many, and, I suppose, more
by many, both reverend and religious concur. And the truth is needful to be
known, especially concerning matters in common practice, that men may have
whereby to inform themselves aright.

And lastly, though the minds and judgments of others were not known; yet
were not a truth to be concealed, because some few godly have denied or opposed
it, and none publicly by writing have contradicted them in it, especially
being a point, very needful to be known.

10. For my self, I was at first the rather induced to deliver my judgment in
the point the more largely (having entered into this discourse of Lots in
general by pursuit of Ion. chap. 1.
that Scripture that then I dealt with, though far then from any purpose to
publish ought of this argument) upon these considerations.

First I considered that Vise Joan. Mi^er in consolat. t^mor. conscient. part.
3. c. 1. and I^an. de Tamba^o consolat. Theolog. l. 14.^.5.
there is a fault as well in streightning as in widening of Gods way; and a
subtlety of Satan as well in the one as in the other. For Ambulandu^ est in
virtutum doctrina via regia, vt ne^ strictius fiat Dei mandatum nec latius quam
ipse ma^dauerit: quamuis inde p^ssint aliqui aut libertatem mal^tiae velamen
sumere, aut e contra in despera^tonem corruere. Gerson in regul moral. and
Joan. Nid^r. cons^lat. timor. conscient. part. 3. c. 20.
in the one he does as a Iugler that by putting a pair of false spectacles on
a man's nose makes the bridge seem broader then indeed it is, that he is to go
over, that so he may without fear step aside and fall in; and so he deals
with the dissolute: In the other he does as a Magitian that shows a man the
bridge that he is to pass, through a false glass of an other kind, that
represents it as narrow as the edge of a rapier or the point of a needle,
that so he may terrify him from attempting to go over it; and thus deals
he with those that be ouer-timerous and full of scruple. And that it is not
good therefore by possessing of men's minds with unnecessary scruples, either
to discourage those that be coming on to some love and liking of the good
ways of God, or 1. Cor. 735.
to cast those that are already come on into snares of men's knitting, Valde
periculosum est arctiores laqueos induere co^s^^entijs, quam quibus verbo
Domini stringantur. Calvin. in^^ie l. 3. c. 10 1.
tying them in stricter and streiter bonds then God himself has done, and
making more things unlawful then the word of God has made. Yea that it is in
truth a spice and a branch of (...). Timor Det inanis. Cic. de not. Deor. l. 1.
superstition, as well for a man to suspect that those things displease God*
which indeed do not, as for a man to suppose that the creature can do that
which indeed it cannot do.

Secondly, I considered that many (as I am verily persuaded) truly fearing God,
and sincerely religious, have used and do commonly use these games; and
besides, that many well affected are and have been constrained in regard of
scruple in this kind, to strain themselves to some inconveniences by the
refusal of them, when by those whom they have had dependence upon, or
familiarity withal, they have been urged occasionally thereunto. It seemed
fit and needful therefore to be known, what ground and warrant both the one
had, and the other might have for the use of them; which were I not upon due
and diligent discussion, and that not of late only, undoubtedly persuaded to be
sound and firm, far should it have been from me ever to have opened my
mouth in this Argument.

Thirdly, I considered that the Arguments and Grounds whereupon these Games are
condemned, have made many stagger in the necessary use of serious civil Lots,
which by occasion of bargains bought in common between them and others, they
are enforced often to use, but have doubted whether they might lawfully give
consent unto or no. That which was indeed the first occasion of my searching
and sifting out more narowly the nature of Lots in general. And certain it
is, admit we the principal arguments used against this kind of L^ts for good,
and we utterly overthrow all kind of L^ts whatsoever.

Fourthly, I considered the great offense and scandal that is taken by diverse
of contrary judgment against those that use these games, though never so
soberly and seasonably, as they suppose, on good ground: a means often of much
heart-burning and of breach of Christian affection, yea of S^nsis^epe d^lens
and gemens mulias infirmoru^ perturbationes fi^ri per quorunda^ fratrum
co^tentiosam obstinatione^ and superstitiosam timilitate^, qui in re^us

118. cap. 2.
peremptory, uncharitable and unchristian censuring either other: Such being
commonly our corruption, and the natural disposition of the most, that
diversity of judgment, especially manifested by practice, breeds alienation
of affection, though indeed Mineat inter sententia discordes beneu^l^ntiae

Addo etiam quod Quintilianus habet, Et iudicium animi (...) damnum affectus
proferre.
it ought not so to do. Considering therefore that these games can hardly be
wholly removed, being so common, so general, so usual with the most every
where, I supposed it would not be unfit to assay, if by discovery of the
ground of them, such scandal and offense might be stayed, and Christian
concord and amity in part procured and maintained between such as were before
diversely minded in this matter; so many of them at least as might hear and
apprehend the force and weight of the former Arguments, and be brought to see
the inualiditie and insufficiency of their own grounds against them. Wherein
what I have done (mine endeavor has been to do it) let the judicious and
impartial whosoever, be Judges.

To draw to a conclusion, I could wish in this case, as Act. 26.29. 1. Cor. 7.7.
the Apostle does in some other cases, that every one were affected in this
point as Non mea magnanimo depugnat tessera talo: Senio nec n^strum cum cane
quassat ehur. Hac mihi charta ^uces, ha^ esi mihi charta fritillus. Martial.
lib. 13. epigr. 1. Et quod Plin. epist. 6. lib. 9. de Circe^sibus; Capio
aliquam voluptatem quod hac v^luptate non capiar.
my self: to wit, that albeit in judgment they be rightly informed of the
truth concerning the lawfulness of these games in themselves, yet that in
godly discretion (which I wish yet Equidem ni^il tale habeo; ^abentes tam^n
fero. Plin. epist. 17. l 9. de morionibus.
without prejudice to any that use them as they ought) they would rather
abandon them and forbear the use of them; considering the too*too common and
ordinary abuse of them, and that many, it may be, among whom they live, may
remain unresolved and unsatisfied concerning the lawfulness of them. But
because Optandum magi^ quam sperandum.
this is rather matter of wish then of hope, my second suit shall be the same
with that which the Apostle makes in the like case, to either side; Romans 14 3.
Let not him that plaieth, contemn him that plaieth not; nor let him that
plaieth not, condemn him that plaieth. For, Romans 14.10.
Why contemnest thou thy brother? may I well say to the one: and, Why
condemnest thou thy brother? may I as well say to the other. Why contemnest
thou thy brother as too strict and strait-laced for forbearing of that thing,
which he makes scruple and doubt of, and has no necessity to do? and Mihi
v^nari ne^ vacat, nec libet. Plin. epist. 16. lib. 9. Neutri nostru^ moriones
arrident. Se^^ eis ego and tu capimur and ducimur, quae multos parti^ vt
inepta, partin^ vt m^lestissima offend^nt D^mus igitur alienis oblectationibus
veniam, vt nostris impetremus. Ibid. 17.
why on the other side condemnest thou thy brother as too dissolute and loose
girt, for the doing of that, which he has sufficient ground and warrant for
out of Gods word? And to both sides say I, (and would to God I might with both
sides prevail not for this alone, but for all other controversies afoot among
us at this present) Romans 14.19.
Let us follow those things that may further peace; and Ephesians. 4.15. veritatem

Seek after the truth either of us in love: ready to yield with Act. 18.26.

are, shall be able more thoroughly to instruct us in ought that we were not so
fully informed of before.

CHAP. X. Of Extraordinary or Diuinatory Lots.
1. HItherto have we considered of the former sort of Lots, which we term
Ordinary, be they serious or lusorious, because the use of them requires but
an ordinary power only, for the effecting of that whereunto they are employed;
which we have showed to be lawful, if they be lawfully used.

We are now to consider of the latter sort of them, which we term
Extraordinary, and are by most Divines commonly called Sors diuinatoria Thom.
and alij, generalius quam no^nulli, qui diuinam a diuinatoria distinguunt, vt
Peucer. and Krakeuits.
Diuinatory Lots.

Extraordinary Lots therefore are such as require an extraordinary power and
providence, for the disposing and directing of them or the event of them, in
regard of those things whereunto they are applied. Because it is not in the
power of those that use them, or in the nature of the Lot it self simply
considered, to effect that thereby necessarily, whereunto it is employed. And
herein consists the maine difference between these Lots and the former,
(which being not considered has bred much confusion, and occasioned such
diversity of opinion among Authors in this argument) that in the former Lots
there is nothing necessarily required, but what is in the natural power of the
creatures using them and used in them to effect; it being in the natural power
of the one to fall this or that way, and of the other upon mutual consent
thereby to determine of such matters as are in their power: whereas in these
latter Lots, which we come now to consider of, it is not at all in the
natural power either of the persons using them or of the creatures used in
them, to effect necessarily that whereunto they are used; but some other secret
work, either divine or diabolical, is of necessity thereunto required. And
these are those that are most commonly termed Diuinatorie Lots; under which
head may we well comprehend also those that they call Consultorias huc partim
refert Lauat in Prou 16 and consultorias has appellat Thom. de sort. c. 2.
consultorie; being used, as the former for division and distribution, so these
for divination, and consultation by way of divination: the former were mere
dividing or deciding, these are also divining Lots; those merely civil, these
either sacrilegious or sacred.

2. Now these Lots Extraordinary are used for two ends; either for the
discovery of some hidden matter past, or present; or for the presaging and
foretelling of some future event. Of either sort we have Examples great, and
more then good, store, both in holy writ, and in profane Writers, beside the
daily practice of many as well among us as elsewhere.

In holy writ we find that they have sometime been used for the discovery of
some hidden truth in things present or past, and that either in matter of
distribution, or of retribution; of office or of justice.

In the former case they have been used to discover and make known, whom God
deemeth fittest, or has secretly fore-assigned to some place or estate. And
herein is the difference between the former used ordinarily in election of
officers and disposition of offices, and the use of those in these cases that
now we entreat of; that in the former it being in the power of the parties
choosing to choose where they list and like best, they agree to make their
election by Lot, and there is nothing else required of the Lot, but to light
upon any one of those that are by them propounded; whereas as in these latter
it is not wholly in their power, but either there is required the further
consent of some other whose good will they are uncertain of and seek to know
it by Lot, or the choice is to be made by Gods special appointment, whose
secret will and purpose they desire by this means to discover.

Examples we have in Scripture of Lots used on this manner in matter of
Marriage, and of Magistracy, or of Office as well civil as sacred.

In matter of Marriage it is somewhat of the nature of a Lot that Eliezer
Abraham's servant used, when Genes. 24.12, 13, 14, 15.
he desired of God, what time he was sent to fetch a wife for his young-master
and stood by the well-side, that if of the Maidens that came thither to draw,
she of whom he should request to drink of her pitcher, should make him offer
to water his Camels also, she might thereby be known to be the party that God
had appointed to be his Masters sons wife: which Ibid. verse. 17, 18, 19.
falling out afterward with one of them accordingly, Ibid. verse. 42, (...) 48.
he uses it as an argument to persuade her parents that God had so appointed
it; who being also thereby persuaded do likewise Ibid. verse. 50.
rest thereupon and condescend thereunto.

For as for Josephus his idle conceits Joseph. antiquit. lud. l. 1. c. 16.
that Eliezer should desire by prayer that Rebekka, whom his Master and he had
made choice of before, if God approved that their choice, might be one of those
wenches that came to draw water, and might hereby be known which of them she
were, many coming together, by giving him drink when the rest should deny it
him; and that accordingly when they refused all but she to let him drink,
excusing themselves that they drew it for other necessary uses, and that it
was not easy to draw, she should thereupon rebuke the rest of them for their
discourteous demeanor, and offer her self kindly to fulfill his request; they
are but mere surmises and fancies, having no ground in, nor well agreeing with

ancients that would distinguish this from the usual manner of divination,
spend much pains to small purpose: for it is apparent that it is used as a
diuinatory sign for the manifestation of Gods mind concerning his hidden
purpose and pleasure, as also concerning the issue and success of that journey
and the business for which it was undertaken, and is of it self no more
warrantable then those courses that they compare with it.

Neither is that sound that (...). Chrysostom. in Genesis homil. 48 Vul^ delectu
vx^e^ cognoscere. signis datur h^spitalitatis. Martyr in Genesis c. 24. Et id^m
f^re Zuingl Sed and O^e^st. ibid.
some others have conceipted of this example; as if his meaning and purpose had
been to pray unto God, that such a Maiden among them that came to draw water,
as should by her behavior in that particular show her self to be of a free,
courteous and ingenuous disposition, might be the wife that God had appointed
for his young-master Isaak. And so it should not b^ either a Lot, or a sign so
much of Gods designement, as of the Maids inward disposition arguing one meet
for such a match. Now there is great odds indeed between these two, for one
to pray that the party, that by such an answer shall show her self to be
thus or thus disposed, may be wife to such an one; and to pray that that party
that God in his providence has appointed to be such an ones wife, may be
certainly known and distinguished by such a casual sign from all others: as
I have heard of one that having cast his wandering affection in that kind on a
woman, would needs propound this as a sign to himself, that if at Church
asking to see her book she should point him withal to the Preachers text, she
should be the woman that God had assigned to be his wife. In the former there
is no Lot, nor divination at all, to speak properly; but an humane and moral
conjecture by outward behavior of inward disposition, and a desire of matching
with such an one, if God see it so good. In the other there is a sign set in
nature of a Lot, to discover what lies hid in Gods secret counsel; and that
by such a course as of it self has no kind of congruity in nature with the
thing to be discovered. Eliezers act is rather of the latter kind then of the
former, not justifiable unless it were done, upon special instinct, known to
the conceiuer of such prayer, for the use of such a sign in such sort.

3. Again thus have Lots been used as in matter of Marriage, so in matter of
Magistracy and government, for distribution of offices as well civil as
sacred.

First civil: and so Saul was by Lot chosen King. Which Lot was not merely
diuisory, used barely to determine who should govern Gods people, but
diuinatorie rather, used to discover whom God had secretly appointed and set
apart for that place as then fittest for the same. The business was thus carried.
1. Sam. 10.17, to 22.
Samuel that had the chief hand in the ordering of it, caused the people
sorted into their several Tribes to appear before the Lord ( Coram arca and
sacerdote s^mmo. Iun.
that is, before the Ark of God, and the High-preist, say some) at Mispa Per
duces singularum faemiliarum. Id^m ex I^sh. 7.14.
by the chief heads of their houses: then Preces praemissas. Idem ^x verse. 22.
Cum rogarent Iehouamiteram.
upon prayer conceived and Lots drawn or cast, the Tribe of Benjamin was
taken: and of that Tribe appearing in the heads of her houses, by a second Lot
the house of Matri: and the several persons of that Family being put all upon
a third Lotery, Saul the son of Kish was taken, and Cum ipse Demino reuelante
regem cognouerat, praecipiente in regem vnxerat, cur adhuc eligendus p^r tribus
and familias quaeritur? sed inuentus rex a solo propheta erat: inuentus ergo
quaeritur, vt non inuentus a populo inueniatur. Sort etiam quaeritur, vt cum
quem propheta eligeret, dispensatione diuina prouisum populus dubitare non
posset. Greg. M. in 1. Reg. l. 4. and Theodoret. in 1. Reg. q. 25.
thereby manifested to be the man whom God made choice of to be the Ruler of
his people; as he had before signified In aurem reuelauit Sam. 1. Sam. 9.15,
16, 17.
secretly so much unto Samuel, and 1. Sam. 9 10.
Samuel had likewise afterward imparted to Saul, and had thereunto solemnly,
though privily and privately, 1. Sam. 10.1.
by a visible sign with Psalm 89.20.
sacred oil sanctified and set him apart to that office; as after he did 1.
Sam. 16.13.
David also on the like occasion and in the like case.

Secondly sacred Offices of employment have been disposed also by Lot. For so
was Matthias set apart to succeed Judas in his Apostles place. Act. 1.23, 24,
26.
They (that is, (...). C^rysost. in Act. hom. 3.
the whole assembly) presented two, says the text: and a solemn prayer first
conceived, that God Act. 15.8. 1. Reg. 8.39
who knows all men's hearts, would vouchsafe to show whether of the twain he
had appointed to that place, they gave out their Lots; and the Lot lighted on
Matthias, who was by common consent thereupon reckoned one of the twelve. A
course reported Circuibat Icann^s Apost. ab exilio reuersus, etc (...). Clem.

4. And thus have Lots diuinatorie been used in matter of distribution, and of
office: now there has been likewise further use of them for matter of
retribution, and of justice, in question of offense: and that either where the
offense is either altogether uncertain whether there have been any committed
or no; or where the offense is certain in general, that there has been some
committed, but it is not known in particular either who the Offender or what
the offense is; or lastly where the offense is known in particular what it is,
but the Offender is not. So that the Lot has in these cases been used to
discover sometime whether there were any offense done or not; sometime who were
the Offenders, and so what the offense was; sometime who were the Offenders in
such an offense as was known to have been committed before.

Sometime a Lot has been used where it was wholly uncertain whether any
offense had been committed or no, where both offense, Offenders, and party
offended have been altogether uncertain. Thus when there was 1. Sa^. 5.6, 9,
12.
a plague upon the Philistines, but they knew not well either from whence or
for what it came, 1 Sa^. 6.7, to 13.
they were advised by their Wisards, to send away the Arc of the God of ISRAEL
1. Sam. 4.11.
taken before in fight by them, in a Cart drawn by two new-milch Kine that had
calves, which if they drew it toward Bethshemesh, they might thereby know, that
it was the GOD of ISRAEL that had plagued them; if any other way, that it was
then but some chance that befell them. Which course being accordingly put unto
trial, the Kine drew the Cart directly unto Beth-shemesh; and thereby
discovered unto them both their offense, and the party offended with them, the
Author of the evil that had lately befalne them. Which practice of theirs
though I dare not say as some do, that it was undertaken of them Non fint Dei
instinctu hoc sibi s^gnum constituunt. Martyr in 1. Sam. c. 6.
by divine instinct, much less by any such instinct that themselves were aware
of, (for both these must concur to make such an act as that warrantable to
any) it seeming rather to have risen from their wonted magical superstitions;
yet was it no doubt accompanied with a special providence of God, as Vise quae
Chrysostom. hac dear ad Tit. hemil. 3. and Martyr latissime in 1. Sa^. 6.
the same Authors with others have well observed, thereby conuincing them as it
were by their own evidences, and by their wicked courses gaining glory to
himself.

5. Sometime again a Lot has been used, where the offense in general has
been certain, but the particular of it uncertain, for the finding out of the
Offender, that by his confession upon his apprehension the offense also might
come to light.

Thus was Jonathan discovered, having 1. Sam 14 ^7.
tasted of the honey, that they met with in the wood, when his father Saul had
1. Sam 14 24.
accursed all that eat ought till even, because he would not have his people
hindered from pursuit of the adversary whom they had then in chase. 1. Sa^.
14.36, 37.
Saul asking advice of God whether he should follow them by night or no, God
gives him no answer. He concludes hereupon that God was offended, but he
knows not how, nor by whom. To find it out 1. Sam. 14.38, to 45.
he casts Lots between himself and his on the one side, and the people on
the other side: and having entreated God to (...) verse. 41. da perfectionen^,
i. sortem veram. Vatab- fac sortem venire pro veritate rei. Chald.
give a right or a perfect Lot, (though Cedo integram, i. declara quis sit
ina^xius. Euphe^ismus hypocritis familiaris: qualis 1. R^g. 21.10 qu^^ tamen

some expound his words otherwise) he and his are at first taken, the people
past by: and upon a second casting between himself and his son, the Lot
lights on his son Jonathan, who thereupon confesses his offense in tasting
of the honey with the tip of his staff, against his fathers charge in that
behalf, at that time to him unknown. Which Lot though Quod Abulensis Sauiem
ait ex Spiritus Sa^cti instinctu sortem misisse, n^c suspicabite^ habet
probatione^, ne^ vllam meretur fide^. Malder. de superstit. c. 7. dub. 9.
used without warrant (as the 1 prayer was made without faith) yet was guided
by God in special manner, thereby Temere iactae, a Deo tamen sunt temperatae

enwrap themselves in, as in Iudic. 11.35.

homil. 14.
in Saul by idle, rash and unnecessary Oaths.

Sort Jonas deprehenditur. Greg. ^d. in 1. R^g. l. 5.
Thus was Jonas also discovered. Ion. 1.4.
The ship being on a sudden in strange danger and distress, they presumed
that it was Gods hand upon them for somewhat amiss with them; but for what
sin or whose they were not able to guess, till that Ion. 17.
Lots being cast by them, and the Lot lighting upon Jonas, both the Offender,
and his offense committed, in flying from God, when he should have gone an
other way on his errand, being Ion 1.10.
by him thereupon confessed, were both by that means discovered.

That which Arias Montan. in Ion 1.
a learned Linguist gathers out of the change of the number in those words of
that story, Mis^runt sorts; and cecid^^ sors. Ion. 1.7.
They gave out their Lots; and the Lot lighted on Jonas; to wit, that they
should cast Lots often over and over to be more fully assured of the certainetie
of the thing, and that upon every casting the Lot lighted still upon the same
party; is not unlike that which R. Solomon Iarch^ in Ion c. 1.
one of the Rabbines gathers from (...) Ion. 1.17. (...) Ion. 2.1.
the change of the Gender afterward in the same story, that Cum in piscis
masculi ventre s^tis commode ag^ret, ad orationem animum non adiccit: quod vbi
Deus animaduertit, ^^ctum per vomitum a faemina faeta deglutiri procura^it, in
cuius vtero cum anguste se haberet, Deum deprecari cep^rat. Iarchi.
Jonas should be in the bowels or belly of two several Whales, a male and a
female, the one after the other; the one an idle and senseless, the other also
a groundless conceit. For as (...) de pisce quo^ibet Genesis 1.26, 28. Exodus
7.18, 21.
the Genders in that language are often indifferent and indefinite, else there
might be three Whales as well as two picked out of the text, Ion. 2.10. (...)
the gender being also once again afterward changed: so the enterchange of
numbers in passing sometime Malac. 2.2. 1. Cor. 41, 2.

a thing no less usual, Psalm. 12.75. 1. Tim. 2.15.

it pleased God extraordinarily making good use of their wickedness, secretly
so to guide and dispose the event of that action, not regarding them or any act
of theirs; but thereby to effect and work his own ends, that his fugitive
servant might by that means be reclaimed and brought back to his obedience;
and his power and providence be proclaimed among those, that were before
altogether ignorant of either.

And thus has a diuinatory Lot been used, where the offense and the Offender
have been both equally unknown. Now the like has been used also where the
offense has been known, but not the Offender; where the offense has both
been certainly known in general that it is, and discovered in particular
also what it is, but the party delinquent has remained yet undiscovered.

Thus was there a Lot used for the discovery of Achan. For I^sh. 7.11, 12, 13
when God had told Joshua that an offense had been committed, in retaining
some part of the accursed spoils of Jericho, which ought wholly to have been
destroyed, for which the wrath of God was kindled against the whole army; but
the Offender unrevealed and undiscovered lay hid; Josh. 7.14.15.
by Gods special appointment a Lot was used, (as Gratian. decr. c. 26. q. 2.

most agree, howsoever Vel de triburca ita s^bito defixa vt se loco monere non
posset, vel de obfuscato lapide, cui tribus illa inscriberetur, in amictu
pontificali; in quo R. Salomone^ resutant Lyra and Serar.
some idle Rabbines dream of other means of discovery) and Achan thereby made
known to be the party delinquent. For Josh. 7.16, 17, 18.
Lots being cast for the Tribes first, the Tribe of Judah was taken; being cast
again for the Families of that Tribe, Zerachs Family was taken; and cast
lastly again for the several houses and persons of that Family or Kindred,
Zabdies house, and in it Achan was at length caught and discovered; who
thereupon confessed his fault.

6. Now these were all extraordinary and divining Lots: in regard whereof those
that define a diuinatorie Lot to be that only whereby men enquire into future
events, (as the great Them. Aquin. sum. par. 22 2 ae. qu. 95. art. 8 and de

Perkins of witchcraft, and alij.

this Lot. For it comprehends sundry others also beside such, to wit,

can certainly divine? or, take some course as certainly to discover your
theenery, as if either I dealt with Diuiners or were such an one my self? So
it has been an usual practice with sundry nations, to seek by such courses
to try or discover persons suspected or guilty of some crime.

7. Now further Lots Extraordinary have sometime been used as for the
discovery of some hidden matter past or present, so for the presaging or
foretelling of some future event, thereby to direct men what course to take in
their affairs, or what success they might therein expect. So that Hinc Thom.
de sort. c. 2. sorts super Iona, Jonathan, Achane, Matthia iactas diuisorias
facit: ab Hamane iactas consultorijs annumerat.
as the former extraordinary Lots were partly diuisory and partly diuinatorie,
so these latter are partly consultory and partly diuinatory, being used partly
for consultation and partly for divination, or for consultation by way of
divination. For to divide ought by Lot barely is ordinary, and makes a Lot
merely diuisory: but to divide or share out ought by Lot, expecting to have
the division by Lot made exactly and precisely according to the right of the
thing divided in regard of those among whom it is divided, or according to the
truth of some thing that is thereby enquired into, is extraordinary and makes
it a diuinatory Lot. Again to distribute offices by Lot barely, as to design
thereby who shall have this place who that place, or who be admitted and who
excluded, is ordinary and but diuisory; but to expect that God should thereby
reveal whom he deemeth fit or unfit, or whom he has fore-assigned to any
office, is extraordinary and diuinatory. And so here to determine by Lot what
course a man shall take of two equally and indifferently propounded, is
ordinary, and makes a Lot merely diuisory; or if consultory, but improperly
so termed: but to enquire or determine by it what course is best to take as
likely to prove luckiest and most successful, is extraordinary, and makes a
Lot diuinatorie and consultorie properly so termed.

Now to this purpose are Lots found used, either where the attempt it self is
questioned, or where the attempt and business it self is resolved, but the
circumstances of time place and person are yet undetermined.

First where the attempt it self is not fully resolved on. As 1. Sam. 14.6, to
16.
where Jonathan and his armor-bearer agree to show themselves to a garrison of
the Philistines, who if upon discovery of them they should will them to stay
till they come to them, they would then stay their attempt and not proceed on
with it; but if they should call them to come up to them, they would go on in
their attempt, taking that as a sign that God would give them victory against
them. Which when they had accordingly made trial of, and the Philistines
invited them to come up unto them, they clambered up the rock on their hands
and their feet to them, and GOD discomfited the Philistines that they fled
before them, and they slew a twenty of them within compass of an aker of
ground. It was not Illud animi f^r^u and ad pugnam parati, hoc indicium
esseremissi and fracti. R. Leui and alij quos refellit Martyr ad 1. Sam. c. 14.
a coniecturing of the minds or courage of their adversaries by their answer,
as some of the Rabbines have supposed, but Omen: genus diuinandi non nonu^.
Mart. ibid.
a sign that Jonathan set himself, much like Genes. 24.14.
that of Eliezer Abraham's man before mentioned, whereby he minded to discover
whether God were pleased to further and give success to them in that
enterprise or no.

8. Secondly Lots have been thus used where the attempt or business it self
has been resolved on; but the circumstances of time, place, or persons have
been undetermined.

Sometime they are found used where the persons against whom the attempt should
be given are undetermined, and question being of twain or more, it is decided
by Lot, which of them shall be first dealt withal.

Thus it is said of the King of Babel Nebuchadnezar, that Ezech. 21.19, to 24.
he should stand at the head of a crosseway where two turnings were, the one
leading toward Jury and Jerusalem, the other toward Ammon and Rabba their head
City: there he should consult with his Divines, that is, his Soothsaiers or
Sorcerers; and among other courses, beside inspection of the liver and
entrails of beasts sacrificed, (a practice among the Heathen likewise much
used) thereby to conjecture what success he should have; he should draw Huc
facit quod Seru Ae^. 10. Clarigationem, parum solid tamen, (...) deducit. Nam
per bellicam, inquit, sorte^ agros hostium inuad^ba^t.
Lots also to try which way were best for him to take, whether to bend his
forces in the first place against Ammon or against Judah, against Jerusalem or
against Rabba: and the Lot in his right hand should come forth for Jerusalem;
God in his secret providence so disposing it, as he fore-telleth by the
Prophet, for the deserved destruction of his own rebellious people.

Now this divination of theirs was performed and practiced, as some think,
Commiscens sagittas. Vulg. ri^u gentis suae sagittas nominibus ins^ri^tas
commiscendo: quam Graeci (...) v^cant. Hieron. in Ezech c. 21. quem vise si

by mingling of arowes with several inscriptions, which being first secretly
shuffled were after openly drawn out: as others think, by (...). Sept. Virga

observing on which side it lighted when it came down: ( (...)

others turned otherways:) as others again think, Calculis inscriptis. Iun.
by stones with inscriptions or marks on them, the one for Jerusalem, the
other for Rabba: which is not altogether unlikely. Howsoever it were, it is
apparent by the place, that some kind of Lotery or other was used in that
consultation of his, and therein Authors all agree.

The like course may be thought to have been used also Esai 36.10. Vise
Justin. orthodox. quaest. 2* and 146.
by Senacherib King of Assure: howbeit the one took not the same effect with
the other, because it pleased not God to grant that success to the one, that
he thought good to vouchsafe the other.

Sometime again are Lots used where all other circumstances are resolved on,
and the time only undetermined.

Thus ^hen Est. 3.6, 7.
Haman had resolved to do what he could for the destroying and rooting out of
the whole Jewish nation, he caused Lots to be cast for the day and the time;
that is, by Lot he made enquiry what time would be fittest and most fortunate
for the enterprising or executing of that his exploite. And the Lots being cast
in the first month Nisan about our March from day to day and from month to
month, fell out upon Adar the twelfth Month much about our February, near upon
a twelue-month between; Est. 9.2.
what time it fell out contrary to Hamans expectation, and to that success
that his Sorcerers had by their sorceries promised him: As the like delay upon
the like ground was a mean Is (Val. Proc^llus Caesaris Legatus ab Ariouisto

that a certain Christian Bishop with diverse his Disciples being often put upon
it, the casting Lot never lighted either upon him, or upon any of his company,
save one alone, who by that means was made a Martyr.

The means and manner of their performance thereof were manifold; as were also
the matters and affairs wherein they made use of it. For the Sclauonians, as
the R. Moses ad praecept. neg. 52. Vise Munsteri praec^pt. Mos.
Jewish Rabbines write of them, used to pill a stick or a greene-peice of wood
on the one side leaving the bark on the other side, and then casting it up
into the air, by it to conjecture of the good or bad success of their business
intended, as it lighted with the bark or the bare side of it upward. Not
altogether unlike that which is reported Hugo Lins^h^tan. part. 2. Indiae

of the Chinois, that they use to the like purpose two sticks tied together
with a string of some length, on the one side flat, and round on the other;
which sticks if they light and lie both alike on the flat side, they account
it a good sign, if vnalike, an evil sign. As also diverse barbarous people in
Germany are recorded, Nec sorti^ra e^s vsus ignotus; s^g^ide^n tribus ligni

by letters drawn in the dust with a corn of some grain wheat, or barley,
laid on each of them, and a cock turned in to them to pick up of them which he
would: both herein agree that these four Greek letters th E O d were in that
order as they here stand, either struck upon by the ring, or picked upon by
the Cock, whereupon they concluded that one Theodorus a noble man of special
note was the person whom that Oracle of theirs then aimed at: which coming by
some means or other to the Emperors ear, was occasion not of the death of
that Theodore alone, but of many others also whose names began with those
letters; and yet missed he of Theodosius, who afterward did indeed succeed him
in the Empire.

his comfort, on these words in the first of them, Quae nondum repori.
Because ye have left the Lord your God, and walked after other Gods, and done
evil in his sight, therefore ^ has God delivered you into the hands of your
enemies; In the second upon these, as the vulgar Latin has them; Veruntamen
pro^pter delositatem posusti eis mala: deiecisti ^os dum allenarentor, etc.
Psalm. 73.18, 19.
But for their deceitfulness have thou laid evils upon them: Thou have cast
them down, when they were advanced: How become they desolate? they perish for
their iniquities; In the third upon these; Matthew. 26.2.
Ye know that after two days the Paschall feast shall be; and the So^^e of
man shall be delivered up to be crucified. Which sayings somewhat sorted with
those things that then afterward befell.

Yea this Gregory himself (though Delrio mag. disq. tom. ^ l. 4. c. 2. q. 7.

some seek to excuse him) was Auspicium ex sacris literis Ma^gar. Bigue not.

who upon report brought him that some of his Clerks were by one Leudastes
apprehended, resorted to his Psalter, and therein lighted on that verse, Psalm.

He led them out in hope, and they feared not: and their enemies the sea
ouer-whelmed: Which he notes to have taken in part effect in Leudastes, in
great danger shortly after of being utterly drowned.

As also the like course he reports (whereby it may appear that it was no
strange or unusual matter even with the best in those times) that Greg. Turon.

Thus Petrus Blesens. Epist. 30.
Peter of Blese sometime Archdeacon of Bath reports of himself, that having
dreamed once or twice of a friend of his, that he saw him invested as a Bishop,
but with omission of some ceremonies, Cum curi^sicatis humanae sorti^us and
revolution: Psalterij visionis euentum diligentius explorarem.
out of a natural curiosity he betook himself to his Psalme-booke by way
of Lotery; wherein the first words that offered themselves to his view were
those; Psalm. 99.6.
Moses and Aaron among his Priests.

Thus Symion Metaphrast. and Su^ius tom 5. in Theodora Septemb^ 1 and Lipoman.

Saint Theodore, as they style her, (if we may believe their reports of her)

desired from her by an Evangelical Lotery to know what should become of her;
and thereupon putting her self into man's apparel, she ran away from her
Husband, and became a professed Monk, and so lived undiscovered to her dying
day.

And thus lastly, to make up this troop, foolish Saint Fraunces, (I may well
so term him, if all be true that Lege Antonin. hist. part. 3. tit. 24. and

when one Bernard a man of wealth would needs be a follower of his; advised
him first to consult with God about so weighty a work; which he did, says the
story, by repairing with Saint Frances to a Priest, who after Mass ended
making a cross on his Masse-booke, and then opening it at adventures three
several times one after an other, lighted still on Matthew. 19.21. and 16.24.
and Mark. 6.8.
some text or other that tended to that purpose; whereupon that Bernard, by
Saint Francis his advice, left all, and became one of his followers. As also
Specul. Franc. and Socier. c. 4.
the same Saint Francis, as they say, reports of himself that being tempted
to have a book, which seemed contrary to his vow, that denied him ought but

coats and a cord and hose, and ( in case of necessity only) shoes, he
resorted for advice, after prayer premised, to the Gospel; and there lighting
on that sentence; Matthew. 13.11.
To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to others
by parables; he thereupon concluded that he should do well enough without
books, and suffered none of his followers therefore to have so much as either
a Bible or a Breuiary or a Postquam habueris Psalteriu^, concupisces and
Breuiarium habere, etc.

CHAP. XI. Of the unlawfulness of such Lots.
1. NOw of these extraordinary and diuinatory Lots before mentioned (for such
all of them were) some were lawful, some were unlawful; but none of them are
now lawful. Those were lawful that were used Deo vel palam iubente, vel intus
instigante. Riber. in Ion. c. 1.
either by express word and warrant from God, as that 1. Sa^. 10.18, 19.

used by Samuel for the election of Saul; and Josh 7.14. Iussu Domini. Lauat.
iustinctu peculiari factum. Calvin. in Josh. c. 7.
that used by Iosuah for the discovery of Achan; or by special instinct of the
Spirit of God; as it is certain of Act. 1.14, 15, 24, 26. Diuina inspirations

probable, yet questionable, (for Ergo parism solid lunius; Reieuentus

that used by Eliezer Abraham's servant; and of 1. Sam. 14.6. prophetico spiritu

that used by Jonathan and his Armor-bearer, paralleled usually with it: which
though approved in them, yet are Priuilegia singulor^^s non pessunt legem

not to be imitated of us, because they are extraordinary examples, and such as
are beside rule; and therefore are no precedents or paternes to us, who must
walk by ordinary precepts, not by extraordinary practices.

Those were unlawful that were done without either, whether the event were
expected from the true God, as in the Lot used 1. Sam. 14.41.
by Saul that lighted upon Jonathan; or from false Gods, Devils and Idols, as
in that used 1. Sam. 6.7.
by the Philistine Sorcerers and Soothsayers; that used Iona 1.7.
by the Mariners for the discovery of Jonas; that used Ezech. 21.19.
by Nebuchadnezar in way of consultation for the seige of Jerusalem, and that
used Ester 3.7.
by Haman for the destruction of the Jewish nation. Of which some took effect
indeed accordingly, as Ezech. 21.23, 24.
Nebuchadnezars Lotery for his journey and expedition against Jury, God framing
the event of it to his desire, for the effecting of his own will in the
punishment of that people; and so likewise in those Lots cast Iona 1.7.
upon Jonas and 1. Sam. 14.41.
Jonathan: Sometime they took not effect, as in Ester 9.1.
Hamans Lotery for a fit time to destroy the Jews, where God turned the event
to a clean contrary issue, and made that day the downefull of him and his, and
other the enemies of his people, which the Lot had assigned for their
destruction by them.

For howsoever some Vise Gl^ss. ad c. 24. q. 3. Martyre^ ad 1. Sam. c. 6. and
Paul. Palate. ad Ion. c. 1.
grave Authors stick not to say, that some of these latter were done by divine
instinct: and it is true indeed that God has a secret hand and power and
providence in directing and ordering all proiects and purposes both of good and
bad: yet we cannot safely say, that there was such a special and immediate
instinct, as in some of the one that made their actions warrantable, so in the
other whose courses were unwarrantable in them. And the difference herein is
this, that (...). Plato Apolog. Multa praedicuntur instinctu quodam impulso
spiritu nescientiu^ Aug. de trinit. l. 4. c. 17.
the one speaks and Non sunt operis diuini conscij. Bern. de great. and lib.
arb.
works at random, as Joan. 11.51. Aug. ibid. and contr. Faust. l. 16. c. 23.
Et in Leuit. q. 49. Etia^ per acerrimum hostem nesciente^ quid dixerit,
insignem protulit prophet^a^.
Caiphas did sometime, Agunt quod vult Deus, sed non volunt quod v^lt Deus.
Bern. de great. and lib. arb.
not intending or regarding any such divine motion or direction, howsoever God
secretly direct the business they dea^e in and their actions therein, to such
event as he sees good himself: whereas in that special instinct that makes
an act warrantable, the party employed in it by God knows it and
understands it to be such, and Et agunt quod vult Deus, and volunt quod vult
D^us. Bern. ibid.
concurreth with God as well in will as in work, as well in intention of his
end as in execution of his will. Now the former alone will not serve to
justify an action, Comes, non causa.
not so much built on it, as accompanied with it; no more then (...). Act.
4.28. Et (...). Act. 2.23.
Gods secret counsel or purpose, his predestination or preordination will
acquit the cursed Jews from sin in the crucifying of Christ.

None of them are at this day lawful to us; neither do either of those kinds
afford us warrant for the like: the former being Admiranda, non imitanda.
Martyr in 1. Sam c 14.
to be admired as marvelous, the latter to be abhorred as superstitious; and
neither of them to be now adays imitated of us; because neither have we any
such warrant, as the one had; neither may we do ought without warrant or
against warrant, as the other did.

2. So that the point we propound concerning these Extraordinary and
Diuinatorie. Lots is this, that Sorts diuinatoriae toto genere sunt i^^citae.
Malder. de superstit. c. 7. dub. 9. Casetan. sum. Peucer. de diuinat. K^^kcu^tz
in Ion. and alij.
It is not lawful, (without express warrant or special revelation from God)
to use Lots, either for the discovery of any hidden truth, or for the
foretelling and presaging of any future event: for the discovery of any hidden
truth, as to tell where treasure lies hid, to discover a theft, to recover
things lost, and the like: or to foretell things to come, as what fortune in
general a man shall have, which by fortunebookes is sought into, or what
success he is like to have in some particular affairs, as in matter of
marriage, in going to war or to sea, iourneying by land, or the like: under
which head are comprehended all Consultoriae equi ac diuinatoria illicitae.
Malder ibid. Et Delr. mag. disq. tom. 2. l. 4. c. 3. q. 7.. 4 Ordinary
illicitae. Io. Buscus ad Bles. epist. 30.
Consultorie Lots, with the rest therefore alike condemned.

For first God himself in his word has expressly forbidden all such kinds of
divination, and this of Sorcery or Lotery (for Vise supra Chap. 10.. 9.
so that word signifies) by name among the rest.

To pass but lightly by that place in Leuit. 19.26.
Leuiticus, though of great and sufficient weight in this point; wherein God
inhibiteth his people to use Sorcerie, and some other superstitions like it: In
the book of Deuteronomie he reckons up the same amids many other detestable
and abominable courses, which practiced by the Heathen, whom he then threw out,
he prohibiteth his people to have any dealing withal. Deuteronomy. 18.9, 10, 11, 12.
When thou come, says he, into the land that the Lord thy God gives thee,
do not learn to do after the abominations of those Nations that God casts
out before thee. Let none be found among you, that makes his son or daughter
pass through the fire: a foolish ceremony, as Moses M^im^^is scribit solitos
Am^rraeos foe^us ex viero recentes per fl^mmam transmittere, qua ratione a
calam^tatibus liberati miri nod^bant: quam and superstitionem a nutricibus in

perils of spells and witchcraft, as they supposed, by making them pass

others expound it of burning their children in sacrifice to Idols and
Devils, which in imitation of Deuteronomy. 12.31.
the Heathen some idolatrous Psalm 106.37, ^8 I^rem. 19 5. Ezech. 16.21. and

the foretelling of future events, without the compass of man's natural skill:

consulting with those that raise up the souls of the deceased, as the Devil
bears men in hand, and makes many believe.

So that all these courses are there joined together, as they hang all on one
string, and they are all alike prohibited and condemned by God, as being
practices that Ieuit. 19.31.
pollute all that use them, if not in body, yet 2. Cor. 6.14, 15, 16, 17. and

in soul; and that make them abominable, if not in man's eye, yet in Gods
sight. So says the text expressly. Deuteronomy. 18.12.
For all that do such things are abomination to the Lord thy God: who will
Deuteronomy. 18.14.
not therefore suffer any of his to do so. What could be more plainly or
pregnantly spoken for the condemning of these courses, and for the removing of
that objection, which men commonly make? to wit; What hurt is there in these
things? What evil is there in a spell or a charm, as long as there is nothing
but good words in it? or what harm can there be, in casting of Lots, or in
drawing of cuts, or in pulling an arow out of a quiver, in holding a sieve
between two hands, making a child run between two fires, breaking a bone
between twain, and the like? Yea but, says God, these be courses that I
utterly abhor, when they are used to these ends; and all that so use them, or
have dealing with them, by causing such things to be done by others for them,
are not abominable only, but even abomination it self in my sight. That which
should be a sufficient argument to us, to make us Psalm. 97.10. Amas illum?
debes odisse, quod odit. Aug. ibid.
if we do sincerely love him, to hate and abhor them, albeit we could see no
hurt or harm at all in them.

3. But that we may the better conceive the cause why God thus forbids and
abhors these courses: (for it is not without special reason ordinarily that
God enioynes or inhibites ought:) let us in the next place more particularly
consider the manifold evils that are in these practices: whereby it shall
evidently appear, that men make themselves guilty of Curiosity, of
Superstition, of Idolatry, of Presumption, of diabolical Impiety, and of high
Treason against Gods majesty.

Curiosity: For it is a point of vain, yea of Impietas est e^ velle scir^ quae

impious Curiosity to enquire into those things that God has concealed and
kept in his own power: in which regard therefore Act. 1.7.
our Savior reproves his Disciples when even by lawful means they enquired
into things of that nature; as also Joan. 21.22.
he rebuked Peter by name for being over inquisitiue in that kind. But where
God has denied men ordinary means of discovery, there does he reserve and
keep things in his own power; concerning which therefore that rule of Gods
Spirit holds, Deuteronomy. 29.29.
Things concealed belong to God, things revealed to us. So that though they be
things that concern us, and might be of some use to us, if by ordinary means
and direct courses we could come to discover them; yet when God has either so
concealed, or suffered them so to be concealed from us, that by ordinary
courses they cannot be discovered, it is not lawful for us to seek to come to
notice of them by extraordinary means; (no more then it was for our Savior
Christ as he was man, and Galat. 4.4.
made for us under the Law, Matthew. 4.3.
to seek to his Father to have stones turned into bread, when food failed
him:) but Contenti nos illis debemus esse, quae nobis Deus aperir^ dignatus

we must be content with the good pleasure of God, and rest satisfied with so
much as by lawful means may be known, unless we will make our selves

And in this regard are the Arts that tend hereunto called (...). Act. 19.19.

1. Sam. 6.19.
It was death for any man to look into the Arc, or Number. 4.15, 20.
but to peep into the holy of holies. And as it is sin for a man to search
and pry into what God has concealed; so to search by such courses as he has
not warranted; or to search into such things, as it is therefore apparent that
he has concealed and would have hid from us, in that he has taken away all
ordinary means of discovery, and offers not extraordinary means of
himself: which howsoever we may accept, yea Esai 7.12, 13, 14.
we ought not to refuse, when God offers and suggesteth them to us; for that
were to contemn God; so we ought not to desire or request at Gods hands, much
less frame them to our selves, when God shall not see good so to do; for that
is manifestly to tempt God. Esai 59.21. and 30.21.
God has promised his people his Word and John 14.26. and 16.13. 1. Ioh. 2.27.
his Spirit to direct them, and to Deuteronomy. 18.15, 16. Ephesians 4.11, 12, 13, 14.

in whatsoever shall be necessary or needful for them to know: so that they
shall not need to seek to such indirect courses, as can neither probably nor
profitably acquaint them with his will, being taken up beside and against his
will.

4. Secondly such courses make the Users of them guilty of Superstitiosa
instituta sunt molimina omnia artium magicaru^. Aug. de doct. Chr. li. 2. c. 20.
Superstition. For what is Superstition but Superstitiosu^ est quod causam
habet nec naturalem, nec humana^, nec diuinam. Thom de sort. c. ^. Superstitio
est quando quis ^e aliqua ad aliquid vtitur, ad quod virtus aut vis e^us
naturalis extendi non potest. Ibid. Siest in ext^ vis aliqua quae declaret
futur^, necesse est came ^utcu^ reru^ natura esse coniuncta^, aut co^firmari
quod ammodo numine de^ru^ vique diuina. Cic. de divine. l. 2.
to ascribe that to a Creature, or to use a Creature to that end, which it has
no natural power and efficacy unto, or whereunto it is not by any divine
ordinance enabled. But in these cases is a Lot applied unto that use, and that
virtue ascribed unto it, which it neither has by any natural power of it
own, nor has received by any ordinary ordinance of God, nor can atcheiue by
the will or power of the Vser joined with it. For herein is the difference
between the former Diuisory, and these Diuinatory Lots; as also between those
special ones used at Gods express appointment, and these; in that the former
were applied to no other ends then Lots have power of themselves io^ned with
man's will and consent to effect; the latter likewise to such as they had power
to effect by virtue of Gods covenant or appointment joined with them.

For example: a Lot has a power of it self to light uncertainly, and yet
certainly in some sort; uncertainly, because indefinitely, for it is in
possibility to fall diverse ways: and yet certainly in some sort, because it
can light actually but one way alone: this power it has naturally of it self;
but beside this power, from the will of men and their mutual consent it may
receive further power to arbitrate such things as they have power to dispose
of. But neither has a Lot any power of it self, neither can any man by his
own will, or many men by their mutual consent give any such power unto it as
to make it light so that it shall necessarily discover somewhat that is hidden
and secret to them that so use it: and therefore so to use it is mere
superstition.

Again a Lot may have power by Gods will and appointment to reveal and
discover some such matter, and it had so in the lawful Lots extraordinary
before mentioned. But in these we now deal with, there is no such appointment
or agreement of God between us and him; and therefore they can not be sure to
have any such power now from him. To make that we say by instances more
evident: Water has a natural power to wash and to cleanse the body, and men
may use it therefore to that end. But to be a Romans 4.11.
sign and seal of Gods covenant of grace, that it has not but by Matthew.
28.18. Mark. 16.16.
special appointment from God, and therefore may not to that end be used of
any save 1. Cor. 12.13. Galat. 3.27.
those alone that are in such covenant with God. Psalm. 104.15.
Bread likewise has a natural power to nourish man's body, and yet not that
neither, unless a man receive it and retain it and concoct and digest it. But
Matthew. 26.26. 1. Cor. 11.23, 24.
to be a Type of Christ's body, that it has from his institution only; without
out which no power or skill of man could make it to be such: else why might not
a piece of flesh do as well as a bit of bread? and Exodus 12.3, to 9. Leuit. 1.
and 4 and 16.15. 1. Cor. 5.7. Coloss 2.17.
that was once, but now is not, a Type of Christ's body, because there was an
ordinance then for it, whereas now there is none. Again Luke 10.34.
the Samaritan is said to have washed his neighbors wounds with wine and oil
mixed together. But our Savior Christ John 9.6.
cured the Beggar that was borne blind with clay tempered with spittle, and
Mark 7.23, 35.
another that was both dumb and deaf too with spittle alone. Agar^^um and
Scammoniam sumere nulla lex vetat: superstitiosis applicaturis ac magicis
precaminibus vti vetat Christiana pietas Erasm. ad Pseudeuang.
The one has warrant to be used still, because it had and has still such
power from the nature of the creature; and therefore it is not superstitious:
whereas the other can not with any good warrant be now used, because it had his
power then not from the nature of the creature, but from the special will and
pleasure of the Creator; which power therefore ceasing with his pleasure then,
to use the creature now to that purpose were merely superstitious. In like
manner here to use a Lot unto that which of it self it has a natural power
unto, or by humane help it may have power to effect, is not in that regard
unlawful: But for a man to attempt to do that by a Lot, which neither by any
natural faculty, nor by any humane institution it has power to perform,
where there is no ordinance of God enabling it, is mere superstition.

5. Thirdly those that thus use Lotery stand guilty of Idolatry. For what is it
but Idolatry to ascribe that to the Creature that is proper to the Creator?
But Di^ini dicuntur qui futura praenoscere profitentur, quasi sibi
attribuentes, quod propriu^ est Dei. Thom. de sort. c. 2. Haec omnia vitio^a
sunt, quia quod est Dei creaturis tribuitur. Martyr in 1. Sam. c. 14.
in such cases is that ascribed to the creature that is proper to the Creator,
namely Esai 41.22, 23.
to foretell tell things future without the causes or grounds or natural
signs of them, such as the Lot whereby they are foretold has no connection or
congruity at all with. For Cum futura pendent ex causis certis and necessarijs,
non pertinent ad diuinationem interdictam: ita Solis, Lunaeque praeticuntur
defecti^, etc. quae autem (...) solent euenire, possunt ex causis probabilibus
praeuideri, vt mors morbusue a medico. Contingentia vero quae (...) dicuntur,
and in vtramque paertem aeque propendent, non praeuidentur nisi a Deo solo.
Martyr in 1. Sam. c. 14.
whereas we sorted Events before into three ranks; some necessary, that
keep in a constant course naturally; some contingent and not casual, that
fall out for the most part alike, though they vary now and then; some
Contingent and Casual, that are altogether uncertain, as the causes also are,
whereupon they depend: The first sort, as the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon
may be certainly foreknowne and foretold, because the causes of them are
constant and certainly known of us; the second sort also, as disease and
death in some cases may with some good probability be preconiectured and
guessed at by those that are well seen and experienced in the signs and
causes of either: but the third sort depending upon causes utterly uncertain
and unknown unto us, cannot be foreseen or foreknowne, and therefore not
foretold certainly but by God himself alone. And Quae praesentiri aut art,
autratione, aut vsu, aut coniectura possunt, ea non diuinis, sed peritis
tribuenda. ita relinquitur, vt ea fortuita diuinari possint, qua nulla nec
art, nec sapientia praeuideri possunt. Cicer. de divine l. 2.
in this third sort of Events alone is this kind of Lot conversant, which no
wit or skill of man is able to foredetermine or foresee. This kind therefore
of Lot Diuinatory and Divination by Lotery is not only, as the Canon justly
charge it, Sors fidelibus prohibetur, ne sub specie diuinationis ad antiquos
idololatriae cultus rediret. Gratian. c. 16. q.2. quia propter affiduitatem
procliuis est lapsus in idololatriam, sicut a iuramento ad periurium. Gloss
loam ibid.
a step to Idolatry, but even Sortilegi and diuini sunt excommunicandi ^ est
enim genus quoddam culturae idolorum ex daemonum consultationibus futura
praedicere. Sicut enim auarus quia cultu^ Deo debitum numino impendit, idolorum
cultor ab Apostolo nominatur Coloss. 3.5. sic qui futura praestigijs
quibus^ibet inuenire laeborant, diuinitatis iura creaturis attribuunt. Futura
eni^ praescire solius Dei est, Esai 41.22, 23. Cultores vero idolarum a
fidelium communione separandi s^nt, 1. Cor. 5.11. Great. c. 26.9.5.
a spice also of Idolatry and sacrilege it self, robbing God of that that is
his proper due, and attributing that unto the creature that is peculiar to the
Creator.

6. Fourthly such lotting makes men guilty of presumption against God. For
whereas some, it may be, will say: Yea but we expect not the event when we use
Lots on this wise from the creature, but from God himself the Creator. I
answer those that so say: It is impiety and presumption for any to do so. For
what is this but a tempting and a stinting of God? what is it but a prescribing
of God what he shall do? It is not therefore true nor sound that some say,
that De buiusmodi futuris licet per modu^ consultationis diuinu^ requirere
iudicium. Thom. de sort. c. 5. Si quis per sortium proiectionem diuinum
requerat iudicium, non est secuntum se peccatum. Ibid. Non est peccat^m
sortibus a Deo requirere cum reuerentia, quando inueniri nequit qu^m quaeris.
Paul. Palate. in Ion. c. 1.
men may by Lots require an immediate sentence from God in some cases, so it be
done with some cautions; and Cum non superest h umanum auxiliu^, tunc ad
diuinum per sorts recurrere licet. Gloss. ad Gr. c. 26. q. 2. Vbideest
humanum, potest and debet absque temeritale diuinum auxilium etiam miraculosum
expectari, v. g. misses sortibus. Gerson de pace consid. 4.
an extraordinary, yea a miraculous hand of God may therein be expected, where
humane helps fail: as if it were Cauendu^ tamen ne nimis cito ad sorts
veniamus. Vtendum prius De^ donis, spiritu, verbo, ratione: nee sortiendum nis^
necossitas cogat. Neque vero periculum est ne Deum tentare videamur: is enimest
qu^ sorts dirigit. Martyrin 1. Sam. 10.
then only unlawful for men to use Lots in this manner, when there is no
necessity urging and enforcing them thereunto.

For, to argue from Deu^ tentare est de eius prouidentia, sapientia, voluntate
periculu^ facere, idque cum non est necesse: in quo ^^bus mod^^ peccatur.
Primum quia non est fides: deinde quia curiosefit, cum necess^^ as nulla
exposcat. Idem in 1. Sam. c. 14.
that which one of those Authors himself lays for a ground of his opinion in
this point; Romans 14.23. ide^ recte Origin, Vbi ex fide integra and oratione
praemissa fors ducitur, ca quae voluntas Dei continet in occulto, s^rs
hominibus declaration man^feslo. In Josh. homil. 23.
Where no faith is, the act done cannot be free from sin. But there can be no
faith here; because no ground or warrant out of Gods word: (and faith without
ground is no faith but a fancy; it is but a mere presumption where there is
no promise:) God having no where promised by such extraordinary courses to
work for us or relei^e us either in the one case or in the other.

Beside, as the Heathen man sometime said though to an other and an evil
purpose, Miserum est in necessitate viuere: sed in necessitate viuere
necessitas nulla est. Senic, epist. 12.
It is a miserable thing for a man to live in necessity; but there is no
necessity at all for any man so to live: So say I here, It is an hard case for
a man to be driven to that straight, that he must of necessity betake himself
to such courses: but In diuinatoria sort non videtur praedicta necessitas
occurrere. Thom. de sort. c. 5.
there is no necessity at any time that so he should do. For what necessity
speak they of that should warrant such a course? If absolute necessity; there
is none such: For there cannot be any case possibly put, wherein a man is so
straightened, that he cannot avoid it, but that of necessity he must do it.
If conditional necessity, that either a man must do it, or he must sustain
damage, yea or he must die if he do it not; yet here is no such necessity as
may justify such an act. For it is not only a tempting of God, as some have
described it, Hinc etiam in ipsa religione Deus tentatur, cum sign: f^igitantur
non ad salutem, sed ad experientiam. Aug. confess. l 10. c. 35. and de vera
relig. c. 38. Quasi interpretatiue D^u^ tentat, qui aliquid perit vel facit ad
nihil aliud vtile nise ad probandam Dei potestatem, vel bonitatem, vel
cognitionem, etc. quando ergo propter aliqua^ necessitatem seu vtilitatem
committit se aliqu^s diuino auxilio in suis petitionibus vel factis, hoe non
est Deu^ tentare: quando vero hoc agitur absque necessitate and v ilitate,
bocest De. tentare. Thom. sum. par. 2.a 2 c.q. 97. a. 1.
when a man requires some extraordinary work of God for his pleasure, or to
make trial thereby what God either can or will do, when there is no need to
have ought done: but for a man to require some extra-ordinary work of God even
for his profit or his safety as well as for his pleasure without special
warrant from God so to do, is likewise to tempt God: As Esa ^. 12, 13, 14.
(...). Homer. Odyss of, Et Iliad. (...).
not to admit it when God offers it in such case, is to neglect and contemn
him: so to require it before he offer it, is to tempt and to stint him. The
Jews are said to have tempted and stinted God, not then only Psalm. 78.17, 18,
19, 20.
when they required to be fed with flesh having other food sufficient already,
but even then also Exodus 17.1, 2, 7.
when they required to have water by miracle, what time they were ready to
perish for thirst, and had nothing else to drink. And how much more then is it
Deniq^e praefigitur ibi terminus diuinae omnipotentia; praestituitur modus, quo
quasi compe Ilatur operari diuinae sapientiae; statuitur finis diuinae bonitati
and clementiae. Nam quid aliud sonant traditiones ista, fiant illa and i^a,
proueniet absque dubitatione effectus quem querimus, s^quidem reuelau^rit Deus
eis ipsi viderint. nos scimus quoniam reuelationes diuinae non tales sunt,
necprohibet Dius credere, quod dignatur reuelare. Gerson de magic. error. part.
3.
a tempting and stinting of God, when we prescribe him to work thus
extraordinarily for us, for the recovery of some trifling loss, or the
discovery of a Theife?

7. Fifthly this kind of Lotery or Sorcerie (for that is the right sense of
that term) is no other then plain Witchery: and we find them therefore in
Deuter. 18.10. 2. King. 17.17. and 21.6.
Scripture often coupled together. For can we think that God will be at our
command to work for us upon our pleasure, and as we shall appoint him, for
the finding of a rag? No: it is the Devil indeed, not God, whom we work
with, when either we deal so our selves, or make use of those that deal in
such sort. For whence sprang these courses? or Vnde ista diuinatio? q^is
inuenit fissumiecoris? qui^ cornicis cantum netauit? quis sorts? Cic de not.
De^r. l. 3. Medicine ratione^ video: diuinatio vnde oriatur non intelligo. Ibid.
whom were they brought up by? as, the finding out of a Theife by a key and a
book, or a pair of sheeres and a five; of foretelling what shall befall a man
by Fortune-bookes, or by o pening of a Bible or any other book at all
adventures, or by throwing of Dice, or by drawing of tickets. Are they any
where found revealed in any word of God? or were they ever delivered by any
Prophet of God? or are they grounded on any principles of reason and nature? or
were they learned by any course of natural and ordinary observation? no such
thing at all: but Perniciosa and a Zabulo inuenta ats s^rtilega and magica.
Council. Ancyr. can. 1. Vanitas haec magicarum artium extraditione malorum

they have been brought into use only the most of them, either directly by
Satan, or by some lims and instruments of Satan, by blind, superstitions and
ignorant persous, addicted wholly to vanity and to ungodly curiosity.

For Legatur Tertull. dec^ronamilit. and de Idolola^r.
as for those things indeed that have some ground in nature either for them or
the use of them, it is not material of whose invention they are: they discover
nothing but what lay hid before in Gods work, and apply the Creature only
unto that use, which God has endued it with an ordinary power to effect. But
for such things as require an extraordinary power either divine or diabolical
to work together with them, being not able else of themselves to effect what
is required from them, how can we better judge of such then by the first
Broachers and Teachers of them?

Yet to let the Authors and Masters of them pass for the present, and to turn
the course of our speech, with a grave Writer, to some one of those that now
use them. Faci^ contra sortilegos, magicos maledictos, etc. argumentum euidens

Thou that by lotting professest to tell fortunes, or to find out a theft or a
Theife; either thou must do this by miracle, or by nature, or by some evil
act: By miracle (I am sure) thou dare not say; for thou art not a likely
person that God should work miracles by: And, by nature, (I am as sure) thou
can not say; for there is no such natural efficacy in the creature thou
use. It must needs follow then that that is done that is done by some evil
Art, and so consequently by the Devil the only Author and ordinary Assister
of such Arts.

In regard whereof it is truly inferred by all Divines generally, that

there is at least a secret, if not an open, league and commerce with Satan in
the practice of such superstitions, (which 1. Cor. 10.10.
no Christian ought to have) whatsoever men may pretend, yea or intend in the
use of them. For as the Apostle tells the Corinthians that haunted the
Heathens idolatrous feasts to please or pleasure their Heathen friends, that
albeit in so doing they had no such purpose as to be in league and amity with
Idols or Devils, yet 1. Cor. 10.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
that very act of theirs was a kind of society with either: so here the very
use of these diabolical courses, though many it may be intend nothing less in
the use of them, is no other then a trading and a trafficking with Satan,
Amputari itaque and eradicari ab animo Christiano istiusmodi debent. August. de
doctrina Christiana lib. 2. cap. 25.
which even in that regard therefore all good Christians ought to abhor.

So then, do thou make enquiry into such things as God by ordinary courses
refuses to discover? thou becommest guilty of Curiosity. Do thou use the
creature to that purpose that has no natural power thereunto? it is mere
Superstition. Do thou expect the event of it in that kind from the Creature
that thou use in it? thou committest gross idolatry: thou make an Idol of
it. Do thou expect it from Satan? that is plain and evident witchery. Or
lastly do thou use only such superstitious courses as he or his lims and
instruments have been Authors and Broachers of, and which can have no
efficacy of themselves without him and his help? whether thou do expect the
event from him or no, even so also is it no better then Witcherie; yea it is
heinous impiety, and (which in the last place we now charge it with) it is high
Treason against Gods Majesty, which he therefore has at sundry times punished
most severely.

he can not be a subject of the one that belongs to the other; and he falls
from, and rebelleth against the one, that flies or seeks to, or has ought
to do with the other. As therefore when a Prince shall have proclaimed open
war against some foraine foe, or rather when he shall have proclaimed some one
of his Subjects a Rebel and a Traitor, yea such an one as he will never
vouchsafe to pardon, or receive to grace or mercy again, and shall thereupon
have prohibited and forbidden any of his other Subjects to resort unto him or
to have any commerce with him, or with any of those that follow him and fight
under his colors, yea shall have taken a corporal oath of each of them to
that purpose; if any of his people now, notwithstanding this charge publicly
given, and oath solemnly taken to the contrary, shall resort to such an one,
and have intercourse with him, either directly or indirectly, with himself in
person, or with those that shall deal between him and them, shall he not
undoubtedly be held guilty for so doing of perjury and disloyalty and high
treason against his Sovereign, and accordingly suffer, and that deservedly, as
a perjured person, and as a Rebel and Traitor to his Prince? In like manner
then here, our Sovereign LORD and Maker having G^nes 2.15. Ephesians. 6.12.
proclaimed open war, as I may so say, against Satan, yea eternal hostility
without hope of reconcilement, having pronounced him a Rebel and a Rebel
irrecouerable, 2. Pet. 2.4. Jude 6.
such an one as he will never receive again on any terms whatsoever, and
therefore straightly charged and bound all his Subjects and servants by In

as he has been the Author and Aduiser of, and do require his helping hand;
if any of Gods people now shall be found faulty in any of the premises, must
not such a one needs be held guilty of perjury and disloialtie and high
treason against Gods Majesty, and look to suffer accordingly as a Breaker of
his oath, as a Violator of his vow, as a Forsaker of God and Christian
religion, and a Follower of Satan and his accursed faction?

Beside if when a Prince shall have disgraced or amerced one of his Nobles or
other Subjects, and deprived him of goods or dignity for some offense upon some
displeasure, or (as it may be) but to try how he will take it, and what course
he will take in it; if the party so used by his Prince shall repair to such a
Rebel to seek help against his Prince at his hands, and by his aid to
recover such losses and damages as at his Sovereigns hands he has sustained,
could his Sovereign choose but take such an act exceedingly evil? yea were it
not the next way to move his Sovereign to deal in like manner with him, as
he had done before with the other, whom he seeks to for succor; not only to
proclaim him a Rebel and a Traitor, but even to deny him all hope of grace or
favor again? Now Christian men know well all, (or at least they should know;
and cannot but know, if they have read and observed ought in Gods word) that
there is Amos 3.6. Lament. 3.37, 38. Esai 45.7. 2. Sam. 12.11. 1 King 11.14, 23.
no evil befalls any man in the world, be it loss of life, or health, or
goods, or good name, (by what means so ever it be effected, or by what persons
soever inflicted) but it comes from God, (...).

for the exercise and trial of his obedience and patience, or as Psalm. 1 19
75. Ierem. 30.14, 15. Lament. 3.39, 42.
a punishment justly laid upon him for his sin. If any man then when he
sustaineth loss or damage some way in his person or in his worldly estate,
(which must needs be acknowledged to come so to pass by the holy permission
and just judgment of God,) shall seek unto the Devil Gods utter and
professed enemy, or his wicked and wretched Factors for help and releife, for
the recovery of his losses, or for the discovery of the party by whose means
he susteineth them, as if Flectere (...) nequeo superos, Acherontamouebo.
Virgil. Aen 7.
he meant to make trial what the Devil in Hell will do for him, when the God
of Heaven has afflicted him, or refuses to relieve him; how can it but
exasperate the wrath of God against such a party as shall set so light by him,
as that for so small a trifle he is so ready to forsake him, and to resort to
an enemy, whom he is known to hate so extremely? Yea how a meaner man would
take it, any one that has tenants, or children, or servants, if some one of
them that depend on him or belong to him, should upon some hard usage of him,
or because he refuses presently to right and relieve him, when he may, in some
wrongs that he has sustained at some enemies hand, or by means of a bad
neighbor, betake himself instantly to his deadly and irreconcilable enemy,
one that he knows his Landlord, or Father, or Master cannot endure or abide
of all men in the world; how offensive, I say, such a course would be unto any
even the meanest of us, I may well leave to each ones particular heart to
determine. And can we think or hope then that God will take it better at our
hands, (God, I say, whom we wholly depend upon, and who has graciously
promised 1. Pet. 4.5. Psalm. 9.18.
to right all our wrongs, and not to 1. Cor. 4.5. Eccles. 12.14.

often, so expressly, so straightly forbidden us so to do, enacted grievous
penalties against all offenders in that kind, and inflicted fearful
punishments upon the transgressors.

9. The prohibitions some of them we saw before what they were: consider we
further now the fearful penalties and comminations annexed unto them, together
with some examples wherein God has made the same good. As God therefore has
straightly forbidden such courses, so he has set a penalty of death on the
practice or use of them. Exodus 22.18.

that which comes last, is wont to stick best in mind) wherein he includes
them all also within compass of the former constitution, that seek unto the
Witch or the Wisard, as well as the Witch or Wisard him or her self. But let
us weigh the words themselves a little. Leuit. 20.27.
Whosoever man or woman shall have a familiar spirit, or shall be a Wisard,
let them die the death; their blood be upon them: or they deserve well to die;
Caedis eorum causa est in ipsis. Iun. Mort^ digni, qui a mort^ covantur
scientiam ^^tnari. Io. Sarisb. l. 2. c. 27.
they are the cause of their own death. And again, Leuit. 20.6.
If any turn aside after such as work with Spirits, or Wisards, to go a
whooring after them, I will set my face against that person, and will cut him
of from among his people. Where observe we how God says that not only Witches
and Wizards, but such also as seek to them, do turn aside and go from him,
and that even they also commit spiritual whoredom or adultery, that is,
idolatry, in making the Devil their God, while they seek to him in a manner
for help against God, or for help at least where God refuses to help them:
And therefore threatens he even these as well as the former, that he will set
his face (or his Ira^ ^^faci^^, I^^.
wrathful countenance) against them: (a fearful thing for God in anger Deuteronomy.
32.10. Psalm. 27.9.
to turn his face away from one; much more fearful for him in anger Psalm.
34.16.
to set his face full against one) that he will set himself against them, as
they set themselves against him; and both cut them of by temporal death
through the Magistrate Romans 13.4.

consortio ^xcludetur. Ium. ad Gen 17.14.
sever and sequester them to their eternal perdition from the society of his
Saints in heaven for ever hereafter: or, as Leuit. 20.4, 5.
before he had said of some Idolaters, and the like Exodus 20.7. Prou. 19.5, 9.
elsewhere of other Transgressors, that though men and Magistrates should
wink at and neglect such, yet he himself will take vengeance for it both on
them and theirs.

10. But some, it may be, will not stick either to say or to suppose, that
Multa ad terrorem constat esse emissa. Giral. Cam^r topogr. Hib. d. 3. c. 31.
many things in this kind are spoken but to terrify men only; and that God
notwithstanding, being a good and a gracious God, will be better then his word,
and not so fierce in execution as he seems severe in the sanction. That we
may see therefore that Gods threatenings and comminations in this kind are
Deuteronomy. 32.47. Non sunt vanae minae dominicae. Polan. in Mal. c. ^.
not idle or formal, words of course only; consider we lastly some examples
of the fierceness of Gods wrath against sundry persons and people that have
been faulty this way. And to begin with the Canaanites, and those other
nations whom God cast out before the Hebrews; God himself propounds their
example, and the example of his wrath and indignation agai nst them, in
dehorting his people from these practices. Deuteronomy. 18.13, 9.
Be thou upright, says he, with the Lord thy God; and take not such abominable
courses as these Nations do, whom the Lord expels before thee to place thee
in their rooms: as implying that we walk not uprightly with God, we are not
sincere and entire with him, but as 1 King. 18.21.
the Israelites sometime halted between God and Baal, 2. Cor. 6.15.
so we halt between God and Belial, between God and Beelzebub, when we use
courses of this kind. Deuteronomy. 18.14.
For the nations whom thou succeedest, give ear to Diuiners, Astrologers,
Witches, Sorcerers, Wisards, Charmers, Coniurers, Necroman^ers; (for Verse. 9,
10, 11.
all these abominations had he formerly recited as usual among them:) Verse. 12.
and because of these abominations does the Lord cast them out before thee: as
implying, what he says elsewhere in an other case, that they must look for
the like if they be found alike faulty; to wit, Leuit. 18.28.
that their Land it should spew them out, as it had spewed those out, that were
before them in it. And surely, if God destroyed those Gentiles, not for doing
these things themselves so much, as for harkening to those that dealt in them,
as he Deuteronomy. 18.14, 12.
there says; if he destroyed those Gentiles, I say, for so doing, that had
never these laws given them, but the general light and Rom 2.14, 15, 12.
law of nature alone to direct them; how much more justly may he destroy those,
that after his will so particularly, so precisely, so expressly revealed to
them in this point, shall notwithstanding make no conscience of forbearing such
practices, as appear plainly to be so offensive to God, and may prove so
prejudicial to themselves.

11. But God, it may be, though he be so sharp to others, yet with his own
will not deal so rigorously, though they be this way faulty. Nothing less: As
for these practices he destroyed those Heathens; so he spared not his own
people when they took the like courses: his judgments inflicted upon them
remain upon record, as well on Prince as people, yea upon the whole body, even
on both of them together for sins of this nature.

Where consider we the Examples, first of two Kings; then of two Kingdoms and
States. The one of 2 King. 1.2, to 7.
Ahazias, who for sending to Beelzebub the Idol of Acc^ron to enquire whether
he should rise and recover again, lying then sick and sore bruised with a
fall; as if there had been no God for him to advise with in Israel; has this
answer returned him from the true God, whom he should have sent unto, by Elias
his Minister, meeting by the way with the Kings Messengers, that therefore he
should not rise again from his sicke-bed that he was laid on, but should
assuredly die. The other of Saul, of whom this is noted as the maine cause of
his overthrow: 1. Chron. 10.13, 14.
Thus died Saul for his sin, whereby he sinned against God, in that he
regarded not his word; and in that he sought to, and asked advice of one that
had a familiar, and asked not of the Lord: and therefore the Lord slew him, and
turned the Kingdom to David. Where are two sins especially pointed out as
the principal causes of Saul's downfall: the former whereof is said elsewhere
to be 1. Sam. 15.23.
as Witchery and Idolatry; the latter was 1. Sam 28.8, 14.
Witchery and Idolatry indeed. And yet was Saul's case more excusable, then the
case of the most is that use the like practices among us. For he had not lost
some sorry trifle, and desired to know what was become of it: but 1. Sam. 28.5.
he stood in icopardie of loosing life and li^ing, crown and kingdom; and he
had tried all the courses he could whereby he might be resolved of the issue
of it, ere he repaired to the Witch. For it is said, 1. Sam. 28.6.
He asked advice of God, and God would give him no answer, neither by Vision,
nor Prophet, nor by Vrim and Thummim. And how is it said then, may some say,
that 1. Chron. 10.14.
he asked not advice of him? But the Holy Ghost accounts it as good as no
asking, when God refusing to reveal things by lawful means, men rest not
therein, but seek to come to the knowledge of them by such courses as God
would never counsel or advise them unto. Again 1. Sam. 28.1^.
his request to the Witch was to have a word or two with Samuel only; not with
the Devil, but with a good Prophet of God lately deceased: neither did he
suppose it to be the Devil that he talked or dealt with; for 1. Sam. 28.14.
he took him that he saw to be Samuel, though indeed Samuel is imago. Aug. de
doctrina Christ. lib. 2 ca. 23. phantasma. Tertull. de animac. 57. and Hier. in

he mistook him. And yet for this practice of his principally, says the
Spirit of God expressly, that the Lord deservedly deprived him both of scepter
and life.

Add we unto these two Kings, two whole States, two entire Kingdoms; the
Kingdom of Israel, that of the ten Tribes, and the Kingdom of Judah consisting
of the other two Tribes. The Kingdom of Israel was first destroyed under
Hoshea. And what was the cause thereof? Other sins indeed withal, but these
sins among others by name expressed in precise terms, 2 King. 17.17.
Divination and Sorcery; which enormitie withal is there branded with this
mark, that it is V^rs. 17, 18.
a selling of a man's self to sin, and to encense Gods wrath against
himself. Again for the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah begun under
Iechonias, and consummate under Zedekias; God determines to destroy Judah, as
he had done the ten Tribes: And what is the cause of it? this is still
inculcated as the principal, 2. King. 23.26, 27. and 24 3.
the sins of Manasses. And what were his sins, (amiddes many other indeed)
but 2. King. 21.6.
Witchery and Sorcery? Yea left any should surmise that his oppressions and
murders were rather the maine cause of all those miseries that befell that
State, because 2 King. 24.4.
in some places there is special mention made of them; the Holy Ghost
therefore in the story of Manasses 2. King. 21.16.
comes in with them afterward as a by-matter, 2. King. 21.6, 11, 1^, 13, 14.
making the other the maine cause, for which God would stretch over Jerusalem
the line of Samaria, and the level of Ahabs house, and do with that famous
City, as a man does with a dish, that he wipeth, and whelmeth vpside down when
he has done with it: and so ascribes not his fall only, but the ruin of the
whole State to Idolatry, and Sorcery, and sins of that sort.

12. To draw all to an head then, and so to conclude this last argument: Seeing
that God has restrained us of all resort unto Satan, and we our selves in our
Baptism have renounced all kind of dealing with the Devil; we break our
faith solemnly plighted to God, and make our selves guilty of rebellion and
high treason against God, whenever by these courses we seek to him and ask
advice of him, whether we believe and trust in him or no.

Again seeing that the sin of Witchcraft (and this Sorcery is one kind of
it) is so heinous and so capital a crime that God commands the Witch to be
put to death, whether she help or hurt, even for this cause because she is a
Witch and deals by the Devil, and we our selves in our own conscience cannot
but condemn such kind of people, as those of whom, no less truly then
usually, we are wont to say, that they have sold themselves and their souls
to Satan; then surely it must needs be a most damnable and detestable practice
in us, though there were no further sin on our part then so, to employ any,
or to use the employment of any in such actions, as we know that they hazard
the casting away of their souls in them. We might as well make use of some
swaggering Cutter to revenge us by murder on one that has wronged us; or
procure some Knight of the post to periure himself for the recovery of a just
debt unjustly denied us; or hire some light Huswife to entice a man to
lewdness and to play the Whore with him, as Judge. 16.5.
Dalilah with Sampson, thereby to discover something that we suspect him to
have wronged us in. For murder and witchcraft are sins alike notorious in
Gods eyes, who has therefore assigned Exodus ^2.18. with 21.12.
the same penalty for either. And Sorcery and Perjury are very near of one
nature: since by the one a man wilfully casts his soul into Gods hands; and
by the other he solemnly puts his soul over into the Devils hands. And
Fornication in it self simply considered is a far less sin then this is:
as appears plainly hereby, in that God has assigned only Deuteronomy. 22.28, 29
a mulct or a money payment for the one, but has appointed a capital
punishment, even loss of life, for the other. But now more then that, when
Leuit. 20.6.
God himself has adjudged those to death also that seek unto such, as well as
the parties themselves; and has sealed up his hatred and detestation of such
courses, by staying two Kings for them Abazias and Saul, the one by sickness,
the other by the sword, by his own sword, by himself; yea not slaying Saul
himself only, but rooting out his posterity and cutting the crown of from
him and his; and further yet by destroying whole Nations and ouerturning whole
States for these sins, as the Canaanites and those that he cast out before
his people, and his own people themselves too as well as those that he cast
out before them, when they took the like courses: We cannot but see, if we
will not Es^i 26.11.
wilfully wink and shut our eyes against the light of Gods truth concerning
this point Ipsius Solis radio scriptum putes: ita cl^ret. vti Tertull. de
resurr. carnis.
so clearly shining forth in his word, how heinous and horrible a sin this
is in Gods sight: and we cannot but tremble to think of the heavy wrath of God
justly provoked and procured by such practices, if we shall know our selves to
be any way guilty of such, unless we have Esai 63.17.
hardened our hearts against the fear of God, or make doubt of the undoubted
truth of of Gods word: which it were much better for us now to believe the
truth of (...)
unto wise and careful repentance, then find true hereafter by dreadful and
woeful experience, when it shall be too late for us either to believe or to
repent, to believe the truth of the one, or to repent us of the other.

An Admonition to avoid these divining Lots, with Answer to some Arguments
alleged in defense of them: and the Conclusion of the whole.

1. THese things then well weighed that have formerly been delivered, those
come in the first place here to be admonished, that have been at any time
overtaken this way, (not considering, it may be, the greatness and
grieuousnesse of the sin) not to justify their evil act, or to sooth up
themselves in it, because, as the Apostle 1 Timoth. 1.15.
Paul says of himself, when he blasphemed and persecuted, and Act. 3.17.
Peter of the Jews, when they crucified Christ, they did it in ignorance. For

a companion only, not the cause or occasion of thy sin, it does not so much
then as once lessen thy sin; and therefore thou have in that regard the more
cause to repent. And though it were simple, yet have thou still cause to
repent; yea if it were simple, thou can not now but repent thee of thy sin.
For Sequitur ne vltra id esse velis, (id facias) quod si prius scisses, non
fuiss^s. (fecisses) Ter^ull. apolog.
if thine ignorance were simple, and so the cause of thy sin, that therefore
thou did it, because thou knew it not to be sin, thou can not then
choose now coming to see thy sin, which thou saw not before, and to know
thine offense which thou knew not before, but bewail and lament it, be
sorry for and repent of it, seek for pardon and forgiveness at the hand of
God for it, and be careful in time to come to avoid the like evils. This if
thou do not (assure thy self) Subuers^ sunt and a diabolo captini tenentur,
qui relicto creatore suo a diabolo per sortilegia quaerunt suffragia. Council.
Aucyr. can. 1.
Satan has thee in a snare, thou art entangled in his toil, and it is 2. Tim
2.26.
by repentance alone that thou can wind thy self out of it. The Devil
holds thee fast by the heel, as Job 18.9.
he speaks. And Pass^r a pede vnico solo deten^us in laqueo, in e^i^us ^^anet
and perit; nec pede capto prosunt al^. Non hoc q^aeritur quo modo captus
fueris, sed quod captus fis. Chrysostom. in Act homil. 29.
as the Fowler, having the Foul fast by the one foot, is content to let her
have the liberty of both wings and the whole body besides; that is enough to
give him the command of the whole: So though thou live otherwise unblameably,
yet is this one wicked course enough of it self to engage thee body and soul
unto Satan; it is alone sufficient to give the Devil title and interest to the
whole. In a word, either thou sinnedst ignorantly, or wittingly: if ignorantly,
thine ignorance was either simple or affected: if of simple ignorance thou
sinnedst, thou can not but repent, now thou come to see thy sin; if of
ignorance affected, thou have the more cause to repent, because that lesseneth
not thy sin: and if thou sinnedst not of ignorance, but with knowledge, then
have thou yet much more cause to repent, because Iam. 4 14. Luke 12.47.
that aggrauateth thy sin: every way thou have good and just cause to repent,
because thou can no way be freed from sin.

2. Again, both such and all other are in the second place to be admonished,
that they take heed how they give way to such superstitious conceits and
courses, whereby they shall in this manner enthrall their souls unto Satan,
and incense the wrath of God against themselves; yea which their own
conscience cannot but tell them, if they deal sincerely with it and it with
them, that they are deuillish and abominable, wicked and unwarrantable. For
consider me this seriously with thy self; when some trifle is missing, and
thou go to work with thy Book and thy Key, or with thy Sine and thy
Sheeres, for the finding of the Thief; (and that it may be, when it is not
stolen neither; but admit it be:) first do thou think that the Book and
the Key, or the Sieve and the Sheeres are either jointly or severally able to
do ought herein of themselves? Sure thou can not be so simple as so to
suppose, unless there be as little witin thee as in them. Art thou able thy
self then to put any such power into them, which they have not of themselves?
Undoubtedly thou can not: it is a thing utterly out of thy power. What then?
do thou think that God upon thy fooleries will extraordinarily and
miraculously work for thee? then belike thou imaginest that thou have a
miraculous faith: if thou think thou have, try it rather in some better, in
some greater matter, in some matter of more moment, as in raising of some one
that is at deaths-doore in an instant: or rather, try it in neither; thou
should but tempt God in either. But suppose thou should try him, do
thou think he would do it? And what reason have thou to imagine, that God
should work extraordinarily for thee more in the one then in the other? Alike
ground and warrant there is for either; a word of promise for neither. Neither
can thou easily be so sottish, as to suppose that God should do ought in it;
especially when for the most part there is no solemn seeking to God, howsoever
there be some abuse of the name, or of the word of God now and then. If neither
the thing it self then be able to do ought of it self, nor thou able thy
self to give any such power unto it, nor God have an hand in it, other then in
all actions else whatsoever; what can there be then that does it (if ought be
done) but the Devil, whose aid therefore thou implorest, and whom thou
imploiest, yea whom thereby thou show that thou trustest in and beleeuest,
whatsoever thou pretendest? For did thou suppose it to be a vain and an
idle thing, of no certainty, thou would never use it. Yea did thou not
believe that the Devil could and would tell thee the truth, thou would
never resort to him, nor ground ought on his answers; thou would never use
any such tricks of his, nor conclude ought out of the event of them. So that
in truth thy practice shows that thou beleeuest and trustest in him,
whatsoever thou say; and so Deus dicit, homicida est: and tu ad illum
tanquam ad medicu^ curris. Dominus dicit, homicida est; illi dicunt, morbos
sanat. Tu maleficia qui recipis, istorum potius quam Christi verbis fidem
habendam censes. Chrysostom. cont Iud. l. 5.
thou crossest our Savior; in that whereas he says that John 8.44.
the Devil is a Lier and the father of lies, thou supposest, yea and assurest
thy self that by these means he not only can, but will and does tell thee
the truth. Thine own heart therefore, if it do seriously and sincerely deal
with thee, cannot but inform thee, that it is the Devil thou dealest with,
the first Author of all evil, John 8.44.
a Lier and a Murderer from the beginning: and A seauctoribus fallacibus, a
patre mendacij, ab host crudelissemo, quid boni, quid very, quid commodi
sp^res, tu videru. Gerson de error. mag. part. 3. Non magis bonum potest

what good or gain, what faith or truth, what help or health then can be
expected from him?

Oh let not then the wretched desire or love of things lost, or of any other
wealth else what ever it be, much less a vain curiosity and lusting to
foreknow and be acquainted with future events, which God has reserved to
himself, prevail so far with thee, as to persuade thee to pass the lists
and limits that God has prescribed thee, and to join with Satan by satanicall
courses for the satisfying of thine own worldly and fleshly desires against
God. Remember that as 1. King 3 37.
Shimci, when he went to seek his servant that was fled away from him, going
beyond the bounds set him by Solomon, he went to his own end: so when by such
courses thou seek to recover thy losses, thou runnest upon thine own ruin,
thou drawest destruction upon thy self. As Qui sine saluatore salutem vult
habere, and sine vera sapientia astimat se prudentem periposse; non sanus, sed
aeger, non prudens, sed stultus in aegritudine assidua laborabit, and in
coecitate noxiae stulius and demens permanebit. Omnis itaque inquisitio atque
omnis curatio q^ae a diuinis and m^gic^ artibus expetitur, merspotius dicenda
est quam vita: and qui ea sectantur, A se non correxeriut, aeternam perditionem
tendu^t. Aug. de ciuit. Dei apud Great. c. ^4. q. 3.
it is said truly of those, that in sickness, either directly or by use of
indirect courses, seek to Satan for health, that they are strangely and
strongly deluded by the Devil, when they think him willing to help them, who
is ready rather to destroy them, yea Porcos data potesta^^ ^^cauit, homines
itidem, si potestas daretur, necaturus. Chrysostom. contr. Lud. l. 5.
who would do it undoubtedly, if he had his own will: and if there be ought
done for them in that kind, it is not done in Gods name, but in the Devils
name; and better were it for them to be sick still, then to be helped or healed
in that sort: Si sanare visus fuerit, corpus sauat, vt animam cecidal. Idem
ibid.
If the Devil do ought for them at their desire, he heals out the body to
slay the soul; yea he heals the body temporally, that he may slay soul and
body both eternally; and Daemones e^si sa^arent, D^o irato sanarent: corpora
sanarent, vt necaerent animas, etc. odienda aute^ prorsu^ corporalis valetudo
quae animae pregio and morte venderetur. Gersom de ertor. mag. part. 3.
accursed is that bodily health that is bought with so dear a price as is the
blood and death of the soul. So here the Devil for the most part does but
delude men, in promising them that which he seldom performs; and many times
casting them into further losses, in steed of helping them to regaine and
recover the former: Or if he do help thee to thy gold or thy garment again;
yet is it dearly bought, that is gotten again in that sort: he helps thee,
it may be, to thy gold or garment again, to get and gain from thee both body
and soul: and thou by recovering it, yea by seeking so to recover it, sellest
him thy soul for it. Now, Matthew. 6.25.
as our Savior says, Is not the soul better then treasure; and the body then
apparel? And will thou then, against even the Devils own Proverb, Job 2.16.
skin for skin; but all that a man has, will he give to save his soul; will thou give the one for the other, the better for the worse? Matthew. 16.26.
What, says our Savior, shall it avail a man to win the whole world, and
loose his own soul? much more then here, Ne perdas tunicam, consulis
mathematicum. quanto melius petiret tunica tua, quam aniraae t^a? Aug. in Psalm.
91.
what shall it avail a man to gain his garment, and cast away his body that
should wear it; to regaine his gold, and cast away his body that should use
it, yea to cast away his soul that may do well enough without the body,
whereas the body cannot possibly do well without it? Rather, as the same our
Savior says Matthew. 5.40.
in an other case, if thy coat be gone, let gown go after; choose rather to
lose both, the one after the other, then by such courses as these are to seek
to regaine either. Matthew. 5.29, 30. and 18.8, 9.
Better it is, says our Savior, to go halt into heaven, then to go with two
legs whole to hell: and better it is to go naked or thin-clad into heaven,
then to go clothed or well-appareled to hell; without money to heaven, then
with money to hell: better want meat and money, then receive either from Satan;
better lose clothes and coin, then recover either by Satan, or compass
either by any Satanicall course whatsoever. And surely, little love show we,
that we bear unto God, when for such trifles as these are, we stick not thus
to displease him: we cleave nothing fast or close unto him, when even a twined
thread, as we say, will thus pull us away from him, and draw us out of his way
that he has prescribed us.

Let us rather therefore in the fear of God, and as we regard our own good,
put far from us such practices; and not forbear them only, but even abhor
them, defy and detest them, not in word only, but in deed, not in tongue
only, but in truth: that so Deuteronomy. 18.13.
our hearts may be sincere and entire with God, not divided between God and
Satan; our heads and brains busied about Romans 12.2.
searching out the holy and acceptable will of God, not about curious inquiries
into such Deuteronomy. 29 29.
secrets as the wisdom of God has hid from our eyes; Romans 6.13.
our hands employed only in the good works of God, not in the works of that
wicked one, 1. John 36.
which he came to dissolve and destroy in those that be his: and Matthew 7.13.14.
our feet lastly walking in the straight-waies of Gods word, that lead to
life and salvation, and not in Satan's crooked and blind bypath, that tend to
death and destruction.

3. An idle Objection or two would be answered, and all were at an end. In
magicis artibus and sortilegijs sancta multa and honesta frequenter
ebseruantur. Gerson astrol. theol. propos. 21.
In these courses therefore, say some, there are many good words used, yea even
Scripture it self often: and then how can they be but good? at least how can
they be so bad, as you seem to say of them?

Augustine indeed, as B. King on Ion. lect. 9.
some other have well observed, is in this regard ouer-fauorable to some of
these and the like courses, when Hi qui de paginis Euangeli^is sorts legunt;
ets^ optand^m est, vt id potius faciant, q^am ad daemonia consulenda
concurrant. Aug. epist. 119.
he wishes that men would rather make Lots of the leaves of the Gospel, then
run directly to enquire and ask advice of the Devil: and Gregorius Turon.
Tetricus Ar^er^. Petrus ^iesens. and alij.
some, as I showed Vise ca. 10. 10.
before of no very evil note have been ouer-taken that way. Yet both Tamen
ista mihi displicet consuetudo, ad negotia secularia, and ad vitae huius
vanitate^ diuina cracula v^lle conuertere. Aug. epist. 119.
he himself misliketh it; and Great. c. 24. q. 3. etc. 26. q. 1. Vise sup. cap.
10.. 10. and cap. 5.. 3. c^ut. 6.
the ancient Canons have not without good ground and warrant condemned it,
that Gods holy Oracles should be used to such idle vanities, and applied to
such superstitious uses as these are. Holy things may be abused as well as
profane. Matthew 4.6.
The Devil produced Scripture to persuade our Savior to sin. And the
Gentiles sacrifices that they offered to Idols, and 1. Cor. 10.21.
in them to Devils, were the same in substance with those that the Jews
offered to Iehoua. Sed multa in huiusn. odi est sanctitas. Men^tur sibi plane
iniquitas: quasi viz reram optimarum sanctissimarunique non esse possit abusus,
quarum nequi rille and flagui^ s^orest quam aliarum. Gerson de error. mag.
part. 3. Tanto pei^r est supersliti^, quanto plura miscentur bona: quoniam vnde
deberet honsrati Dominus, houoratur Diabolus. Idem astrol. the: l. propos. 21.
The holiness of the thing used excuses not the abuse of it; which is rather
the more heinous, the holier the thing is.

4. Yea but, lastly will some say, Qui sorts mittunt, per visibilium rerum
coni^cturas latentia saepe deprehendunt. Greg. M. in 1. R^g. l. 5. Frequenter
euenit reru^ prodigia certos exitus obti^ere. Pe^r. Bles. ep. 65.
these observations often fall out aright; and the event of them is according to
the truth of the thing enquired into by them. For was it not so in many of the
examples before mentioned? Did not the Lot light right Ion. 1.7.
upon Jonas, and 1. Sam. 14.44.
upon Jonathan? Did not the 1. Sam. 6.
Philistine and the Ezech. 21.21, 22, 23.
Babylonian Loteries answer the expectation of those by whom they were used?
Yea we have found, may some say, by our own experience, that in ordinary
practice they often prove true.

To this I answer: First, Vera quisque sedulo notat, falsa nemo coarguit.
Diodor Sicul. l. 32. de Euno.
they mark when they prove true, but not how often they prove false; as the
Philosopher says of dreams, that (...), etc. Aristot. de divine. per ins^m.
they seldom prove true, and yet many men trust in them, because they mark
those only that so prove. And as one says of relics and monuments hung up
by such as had made vows to our Lady (as they term her,) and were delivered
being in danger and distress, that there were many indeed of them; but Sicut
and Diagoras apud Cicer. do not. Deor. l. 3 Nusquam esse pictos qui nausragiu^
fecerant, in marique perierant.
there were no relics of those that had made the like vows and were not
delivered, but were drowned or perished otherwise: which yet would be many
more, if they were to be seen. So here a few events are scored up and recorded
that have fallen out aright, whereas (...). Dio hisior. l. 52.
many more, ten or twenty for one, had they been observed, might have been
registered, that have fallen out clean otherwise. In the former examples; Ezech.
21.21, 22, 23.
it proved aright with Nebuchadnezar; but Est. 3.7. and 9.1, 2.
clean contrary with Haman. Yea so often thus fall they out, that, as one of the
Ancients well says, At nonnunquam tamen veritate^ vel auspicia vel oracula
tetigere. Quanqua^ in^er multa mendacia videri posfit indusiriam casus
imitatus. Minut. in Octau. Perspicuumest multa vera euadere. Quid quod mulio
plura falsa? Nonne ipsa varietas qu^ est propri^ fortunae, fortunam esse
causam, non naturam docet? Cicer. de divine. l. 2.
though they lie but by casualty, they may seem to do it of industry, and of
set purpose to tell untruths.

And yet Mira prorsus and miserabilis humanae coecitatis insama: quoniam in hac
re december aut crebri^ra mendacia per vna^, casuali^er si obisgerit, v^ritat m
^xcusat, vbi milie in alia mater^a veritates pro vnico me^dacio comperto
despiceret. Gerson de error mag. part. 3.
strange and miserable is the blindness and madness (as one well observes)
of most men, who, whereas in other and better matters they are extreme hard of
belief, and will refuse to give credit to a certain truth, though confirmed
by infinite and innumerable undoubted examples, if they can pick out any one
singular precedent, wherein it has fallen out otherwise: as for example, tell
them (...). Qu ^lis vita, finis ita Sic Saul, Ahab, Balaam, Iuias alij
innumeri. Vade Aug. de disc. Christ. Non potest male mori qui been vixerit; and
vix been moritur, qui male vixit.
how many have died evil that lived evil, and that they themselves therefore
taking the like courses in their life may justly look for the like issue in
the end at their death: yet they will nothing regard all that is alleged in
that kind, as long as they can name one, suppose Luke 23.40.
the Theife on the Cross, though he be but one, and that Some think he was
converted ere he came to the Cross. That he was baptized befort, Augustine
seems to suppose; retract. l. 1. c. 26. and l. 2. c. 551 and deanimae ^rig. l.
^. c. 9. That Matthew. 26.44. The Thieves, may be expounded, one of them: as the
like phrase is Genesis 23.6. Judge. 12.7. 2 Chronicles. 24 ^5. Psalm. 1.3. Ion. 1.5.
Zech. 9.9. Joan. 6.45. So expound it Ambros super Luc. l. 10. and August. de
consens. Euang l. 3. c. 16.
questionable too; but let it go for granted; Vnus, ne quis disperare^; vnicus,
ne quis praesumeret. Aug.
one, says he well, that no man might despair, and but one, that no man
should presume. Whereas, I say, in matters of moment, and that more nearly
concern them, they will reject a thousand truths for some one untruth; or a
thousand examples of events that have fallen out alike and aright, for some one
that extraordinarily has fallen out otherwise: in these cases on the other side
by one truth they will excuse an hundred untruths, and for one event that
casually falls out aright, pass by an hundred, it may be, that ordinarily
fall out otherwise. So Tantam ad credendum prohibita, noxia and vana libidinem
in tam modica credendorum fide quis non mirabi^ur? G^rson de error. mag part. 3.
light of belief are we in vain and hurtful things, and such as we ought
rather to distrust: so hard of belief in good and profitable things, and such
as by God we stand bound to believe.

5. Secondly issue or event argues not either the truth and certainety, or the
lawfulness and warrantablenesse of an action, as even Exitus acta probat:
careat suce^ssibus opto, Quisquis ab euentus facta notanda putat. Ovid. e^ist.
2. Est omnino iniquum, sed vsu receptum, quod bon^sta consilia vel turpia,
prout male, aut pr^spere cedunt, ita vel probantur vel reprehenduntur. ^lin.
epist. 22. lib. 5.
Heathen themselves have seen and observed. Psalm. 10.5. and 73.3.
How many be there every where that thrive in sin and by sin? Hab. 1.13,
14, 15. Dan. 7.21. and 11.23. Apoc. ^1.7. and 13.7.
How many have been Conquerors in unjust wars? Ecclesiae status armis non
aestimatur. Bern. ep. 176.
The length of the lance argues not the equity of the cause, nor the
sharpnes of the swords-edge the lawfulness of the course or the quarrel. It
follows not that the Beniamites cause was good, or the other Israelites bad,
because Judge. 20.21, 25.
in two several battles they beat down their brethren, and their Adversaries
fell before them.

But to come nearer home, take we Nonne intelligis eadem rati^ne vti posse and
aruspic^s, and fulguratores, and interpre^es ostentorum, and augures, and
sortilegos, and Chaldaeos; quorum generum nullu^ est, ex quo non aliquid, sicut
pradictum est, e^aserit? Cic. de divine. l. 2. Et ibid. Non hostiarum casum
confirmas sortiu^ simili^udine, sed infirmas sorts collatione hostiarum.
example from the like: How vain and idle, how frivolous and ridiculous was
the Heathens course of Divination, by opening the bellies of beasts and poaring
into their entrails, by observing the voices or the flight of souls, and
their feeding or refusing of their food? in so much that Vetus illud Catonis
admodum sci^u^, qui mirars se aiebat, quo^ non rideret aeruspex aruspice^ cum
vidisset. Cic. de divine. l. 2.
a grave Author and one of great authority among them had wont to say that
he wondered, how their Wisards and Soothsaiers, that by such courses deluded
the common sort of people, could forbear laughing when they looked one on an
other: and Haec viritim sapie^tissimi cuiusque restui^ fides: ^n vniuersum vero
omnibus horis credit vita nec sentit. Plin hist. not. l. 28. c. 2. Vise and
Valor. Max.l. 1. c. 6.
the wiser sort among them did but scoff and flout at them: one affirming that
Nam istos, qui lingua^ auiu^ intelligunt, Plusque ex ali^no iecore sapiunt quam
ex suo, Magis audiendum quam auscultandu^ censco. Pacu^ius Chryse.
These Wisards and Soothsaiers, that can tell what the birds shirpe, and whose
wit and wisdom lies buried in the bellies and bowels of beasts; may well be
heard, but are in no wise to be hearkened unto. And another that, Non habeo
denique nau^i Marsum augurem, Non vicanos aruspices, ^on de circo astrologos;
Non Isi^cos coniectores, non interpretes somnium Non enim sunt ij aut scientia
aut art diuini; Sed superstiti^si va^^s, imprudentesque arioli; Aut inertes,

o^ strant viam Quibus diuitias p^llicentur, ab bis dracl^mum ipsi petunt. De
eis diuitijs sibi deducant drachmam, reddant caetera. Ennius apud Cic^r. de
divine.l. 1.
The Marsian Inchanters and Spelmongers, and the common Sacrificers and
Bowell-searchers, with the Star-gazers and Figure-casters; as also the
Egyptian Fortunetellers, and Dreame-readers; are not worth a button all of
them. For that they are not such as have any divine Art or skill at all with
them: but are either superstitious Wisards, or blind Buzards, or idle-headed,
or adle-brained, or arrant Beggars. That, like fools as they are, profess to
tell other men their fortunes, when they are ignorant of their own; and
promise to help them to hidden hords of gold, whom they beg a gray groate of:
which groate, says he, they may do well first to take out of that hord, and
then return them the rest. Yet did not these also oftentimes prove true? yea
did they not both prove alike true, both this and that other, when Ez^ch.
21.19, 20, 21.
by Nebuchad^ezar they were both used together? Heathen stories, we know, are
stuffed full of the like events of them: La omnia approba^tibus 830. annorum
euentibus. Plin. hist. not. l. 28. c. 2.
the observations of eight hundred years and upwards, says one of their
Writers, going most with them. In regard whereof Vise^ Zuingl. Iun. Par. ali^s
sup. cap. 11. 1.
the argument drawn from the event to justify the act of Eliezer Abraham's
se^uant, though it may carry with it some good probability, yet is not of
undoubted certainty. For 1. Sam 6.12.
the sign that the Philistine Sorcerers set themselves fell out as rightly:
and 1. Sam. 28.19.
the Witches Samuel of Endor told Saul much truth, and what shortly after came
accordingly to pass. And yet are neither of their courses, by any that I know,
justified. Argumentis and rationibus oportet quare q^icquam ita sit docere, non
euentis. Cicer. de divine. lib. 2.
Reasons and arguments, says the Heathen man, must be produced for the
confirmation of men's courses, not examples of uncertain and casual events.
And well: for, as a Noble man of ours says in a learned and elaborate work of
his of somewhat the like subject, L.H. H^ ward of blind prophecies.
Examples which fall out by chance were never current, where the cause is to be
justified by reason: And therefore till a man can as readily produce a certain
ground to make his guesses good, as score up a register of blind events, we
may rather commend his luck then his learning.

6. Thirdly and lastly when these things prove true and fall out accordingly to
the intent and desire or purpose of the Vser, it is Nu^ viribus sortium.
not as Hieronym. super Ion. ^.1.
Hierome and B^da in Act. 1. and alij.
others from him have well observed, by the force or from the nature of the
thing it self that is used: and therefore Elumb^ ac vanu^ est ab euentu
argumentum: est enim a non causa vt a causa. Martyr in 1 Samuelc. 14.
the argument, says one well, drawn from the event is weak and feeble, as
mistaking much the ground of the matter, and assigning that for a cause which
in very deed is none: like Sacerdotes Papisti^i ambarualia sua ^b^unt. Si
sequatur vb^rtas agror^m, non debemus put^re D^um ill^s audisse, sed re^petua
bonitate sua vsum esse. Martyr in 1. S^m. cap. 14.
the superstitious Papists or Idolatrous Heathens conceit, that ascribed Gods
usual bounty in blessing the year ordinarily with plenty to their idle
Processions, (for Ambarualis hostia, quae rei diuinae causa circum arua ^ucitur
ab ^ijs qui pro frugibus faciunt. Pauli F^stus.
both used such, and they were alike idle that both used) because it followed
thereupon: or like the practice of Fer^el. in method. med.
unskillful Empirickes, that giving medicines at adventure one after an other,
when the disease breaks away by other means or of it self, ascribe the cure
to the medicine they last gave, because that the disease went away upon the use
of it. But they come to pass by other means, and those either Ordinary or
Extraordinary.

Ordinarily it falls out so either by mere Casualtie, or by humane Slight
and subtlety. Quota quaeque res euenit praedicta abistis? aut s^ euenit
quippiam, quid afferri potest, cur non casu id eneuerit? Cicer. de divine. l. 2.
Casu quaedam si^ eueniunt, quae a di^^nantibus dicta sunt. Ibid. Non art, sed

they indeed cure not their Patients, but Chance, if any be cured by them:

Thus Aug. de G^^. ad lit l. 1^. c. 22.
Augustine tells of two Young Men, tha traveling by the way made many
believe that they were Figure-casters, whereas they knew not so much as the 12.
Signs in the Zodiake^ and when they perceived that their Host where they inned
seemed to give some credit to them telling him many strange matters, they grew
bolder; and being demanded by him whether they could tell him ought of his
son, who was then abroad, and staying out beyond his time appointed, made his
Father their Host somewhat fearful that some evil had befalne him; they
little regarding how the matter would fall out in their absence, so they might
give their Host contentment, and get themselves somewhat for the present, bad
him be of good cheer, his son, they would warrant him, was safe, and not
very far of: Which though they knew no more, as we say, then the post, or then
their Host himself that asked them, yet by mere casualtie beside their
expectation fell out accordingly: For the Youngman came in just as they were
leaving their Inn; which made them to be accounted men of extraordinary skill.

7. Again sometime these courses take effect not by mere casualtie, but
either in an Ordinary course by some slight of man, or in an Extraordinary by
some secret work of Satan, or by some hidden hand of God himself.

For as Augustine says of the miracles done or pretended to be done by the
Donatists, that they were Aut figmenta mendacium hominum, aut portenta
fallacium Daemonum, Aug. de unit. Eccles.c. 16.
either of men's forging or of the Devils doing: and a learned Schooleman and
our Countreyman of popish miracles wrought for confirmation of the Mass, that
In Sacramento apparet caro interdum humana procuratione, interdum diabolica
operatione. Alex. de Ales sum. part. 4. q. 53. m. 4. a. 3. sol. 2.
they were either procured by men or effected by Satan: so it falls out often
in these Loteries and Diuinations by Lot.

Sometime they take effect by means of some Ars casum simulat. Ovid. artu l. 3.
slight, that seeming casual that indeed is not, and so a Lot thought to be
used, where indeed there is none: as with those that cheat at dice. As in the
event, that seems skill sometime, that is indeed but mere Chance: so in the
act it self, that seems Chance sometime, that indeed is slight and skill:
as Aliquando in Ecclesia fit maxima deceptio in miraculis fictis a
sacerdotibus, vel eis adhaerentibus propter lucrum. Lyra in Dan. c. 14.
Lyra testifies of the miracles of his time, that many of them were wrought by sleight for gain to delude the people, by the Priests and their Accomplices: and
as (...) Pythiam a Philippo corruptam querebatur Demosthenes. Cicer. de
divine.l. 2. and Aesthin. contra Cres^ph. and Minut. Octau.
the Heathen Oracles were often cunningly and craftily carried to speak to
private men's purposes: and Sic Agesilaus (...) Nialus Victimae iecin^ri
clanculis inscripsit, test Plut. in ap^p^th.
the entrails in their sacrifices by Art and crafty conueighance caused to
give signs of success for men's better encouragement, which they could not of
themselves.

Thus we find in Pausan. in Mess^nia^. and Apollodor. bibliothec. l. 2.
ancient Story, that whereas Temenus and Cresph^ntes Aristomachus his sons
accompanied with the forces of their Vukle Aristodemus (who deceasing left
issue two twins Procles and Eurysthenes in the custody of his brother in law
Theras) had by a joint conquest made recovery of Peloponnesus held by the issue
of Hercules, of which lineage they were, long before, till by Eurystheus they
were forcibly dispossessed of it; and were now to make a partition of it divided
into three portions, Argos, Sparta or Lacedaemon and Messena: Cresphontes
desirous at any hand to have Messena, persuaded Te^tuumfratr^^, non, Temonem
sacerdonem, vtisalsus est Aretius in problem. part. 1. loc. 67. 6.
his brother Temenus (who had seized already upon Argos, and was chosen to make
Lots for them for the assignement of the other two parts between Cresphontes
and There as in right of the two Orphans) to use some slight and fraud for
him; which he accordingly did, as all agree in the report of it, though for the
manner of it there is some difference among them. For Pausan. in Messen.
some of them write that it was agreed upon, (...).
that he should have Messena, or his choice of all three, whose Lot came out
first; whereupon Temenus made (...). Hine Pausaniam secutus Plautus Casina act.

two pellets of clay, the one dried in the sun for his Nephews, and the
other baked in the fire for his brother, which being cast both at once into the
water, and lying there for some time, theirs being dissolved, his of necessity
came forth first. Whereas others Apollodor. bibl. l. 2.
report that it was agreed among them all, that (...). A- pollod. l. 1. (...).

the other two cast in either of them a white stone, Cresphontes cast in a
piece of white clay, which being dissolved in the water was not at all drawn,
and so by that means he obtained his desire, (...). Polyaen. s^rat. l. 1. vt

not by chance, as it might seem, but indeed by couine and deceit.

And not altogether unlike hereunto is that course which B^pt. P^r^amag.

a Writer of natural secrets prescribes to be used, not so much for the
finding out of a Theife, as for the drawing of a confession from one that is
upon some good ground suspected so to be, by putting his name in a scrole of
paper together with many other wrapped all up in lumps of clay severally, but
his wrapped somewhat more loosely then any of the other, into a basen of water,
that so seeming by chance to unfold first, he may, thereby supposing himself
miraculously discovered, be induced to confess it.

In this kind may Imagination also oftentimes do much. For Imaginati^nis

a strong Imagination either in the agent or in the patient, in the doer or the
sufferer, many times furthereth an effect. In the Agent; as when using the Sieve
and the Sheeres, and naming many, whom they think good to question, but among
those many, strongly suspecting some one, the strong Imagination of those, or
the one of those that hold it between them (though no wilful slight otherwise
be interposed by either of them) may be a mean sufficient to work an
insensible motion in the hand of the Holder so strongly possessed, for the
turning of the sieve and sheeres upon the naming of the party by him or them
formerly suspected.

In the Patient; as it is observed Sanare ^icunt^r superstiticsa illa per
inmutationem virtutis imaginatiuae. Gerson de error. mag.
in some superstitious courses of cure, that they may receive some strength
from the Imagination of the party: which yet Verum caue^ medicus, ne vole^do
sanare corpus alirnum, meni^nd^ disipi^ns i^^erficiat serpsum. Idem ibid.
a grave Writer wishes Physicians to be wary in and beware of, least while
they cure other men's bodies, they cast away their own souls: and as Io. Ba^t.
Porta mag not l. 20. c. 8.
the former Author prescribes a course for the discovery of a These, by
making bread or paste of meal mingled with the powder Ex Aetite lapide.
of a stone said to be found usually in the Eagles nest, which the party
suspected eating of together with others, his fear, says he, arising from the
expectation of the event, by drying his throat, will hinder his swalow, that
he shall not be able to get it down so readily as the rest do; and by that
means h^e may be discovered. Which whether it be true or no; once certain it
is, that Certe vim imaginali^am plurimum tum prod^sse tum obesse sanita^is
regiminiqus nescia^? vnde illud vulgatum, Imaginatio fa^it casum. Gersen d^
error. mag. Vis^ Cardan. de subtle. l. 19. and de variet. c. 44.
Imagination is of much force for the producing of effects, and the making of
such things seem to be casual as in deed are nothing less.

8. And thus in ordinary course these superstitious Diuinations sometime take:
but sometime again they hit aright by Extraordinary means, and that either by
diabolical cooperation, or by divine permission or special appointment.

Sometime, I say, by Satan's cooperation; who as Si quando ^^unt miracula
hominibus ad imagin^^c^nflue^tibus, non haec virtute imaginum fiunt, s^d
nonnunq^am operatione daemonum ad fallendum inordinatos cultores, Deo
permittente, exigente talium infidelitate. Gabr. Bi^l super can. Mis. lect. 49.
he is confessed to have had an hand in those miracles, that are reported to
have been wrought by, or at the Images of Saints: so he has no doubt often also
the like in these Loteries and such like kinds of Divination, as both Fraus
and opera daemonum est quod praedicta multa eue^ant. Gregor. Nyll de fato. Cum
a^^rologi mirabiliter multa vera respondent, occulto fit instinctu spirituum

Christian Writers have observed, and Perhos (Daemones) vt Plato in Symposio

Heathen also themselves acknowledged.

But how can the Devil, may some say, come to know such things as by these
courses are discovered?

I answer: The things thus discovered are either past, or present, or future
contingent. For hidden things past or present, the Devil well may know many
things, and much more then men ordinarily do; in regard that he is a Spirit,
and either present at the doing of them, or a Partaker also in them.

First as present at the doing of them; for so Job 1.6. and 2.1. (...)
he was present when the sons of God, that is, (...). Sept. qui and sic dicti
Job 38.7. quod obseruarun^ Orige^ in Job 38. Basil. Sell.S^rm. 1 and Iun. in
Protoctis. Nam quod Cl^^ysostom. in G^^. homil. 23. Angelos nusquam Deifilios
dictos: falsi liquido arguitur. Vise Drus miscol.l. 1. c. 12. Couti^^ Aug
locu^.l. 5. Non facile A^g^los filios Dei dictos in Scripturareperies.
the Angels came sometime to appear before God: and so is often no doubt with
us, when we are little aware of it. By this means therefore Omnis spiritus
ales est, hoc angeli and daemones ^ tot^^^ orbus ill^^ locus vuus est: quid
vbiquegeratur, tamfacil^ sciunt, quam enunciant Diuinit ascreditur velocit^s,
quia substantia ignoratur. Sic and autores int^^dum videri valant coru^ quae

in apolog.
being of a swift and subtle nature, as he can take notice of many things done
in secret, while he is in presence unseen, so Daemon^s alicub^ long iam facta
quod nunciant, quae post aliquot dies vera esse firmen^ur, non est mirandu^.
Possunt enimhoc officere non solum acrimonia cernendi etiam corporali
incomparabiliter prae^tantior^ quam nostra est. sed etiam ipsoru^ corporu^

Acrimonia sensus, and celeritate motus multo ant^ cognita pr^muciau^, vel
nuncia^t, quae ho^^ines prae sensus terreni tarditate mirentur. Idem de
diuinat. d^m. c 3.
he can give notice in one place, what he knows to be in doing or to be done
in some other place, though far distant therefrom: to which purpose Aug. de
Genesis a^^ lit.l. 12. c. 17.
Augustine tells an Example of a party possessed, that would tell those that
were in the house with him, when one set forth a twelve miles of to come toward
him, and how far he was still every foot forward on the way, till he came to
him, at whose hand alone he would take sustenance: Ei^s^^li pr^d^ctio non est
prophetia: sed tanquam so excabitor e specula quam veniente^ vid^t, turmam mox
ads^re pradicat. Martyr in 1. Sam. c. 28.
Which yet was indeed no Divination or Prophecy, says a good Divine, to
speak properly, but as if a Soldier standing on a sentinel should tell of a
troop of Horse, that he should epsy on the way, how far they were come
forward, and how near they approached to the place where they were expected.

Secondly as a Partaker in them, by way of instigation or assistance. For so
was he John 13 2.
with Judas, and therefore knew well what he went about, in the betraying of
his Master CHRIST JESUS: so Job 1.12, 15, 17.
with the Chaldeans and Sabeans in the robbing and spoiling of Job. And thus
Graeci (...) appellant, nos criminatorem vocemus, quod crimina in quae ipse
allicit, ad Deu^deferat. Lactant. instit.l. 2. c 9. Ipse enim nos, vt pessemus,
instigat; ipse nos, vbi peccauerimus, accusat. Origin. in Leuit. homil. 3.
as he enciteth men to sin, and then accuses them to God of sin: so Saepe
illos, vbi peccauerunt prodit, quos in maleficium illexit. Delrio mag. disq.
tom. 1. l. 2. q. 12. n. 10.
often here he sets men on sinning, and to their public shame or bane
afterward bewraieth and betraieth them, when they have sinned.

For future contingents ordinarily he knows them not certainly, but either
extraordinarily or uncertainly only.

First uncertainly; yet probably in regard of Genesis 3.1. 2. Cor. 2.11. and
11.3, 14.
his natural skill; (whereof (...) quas^ (...), a peritia and scientia. Plato
in Cratyl. Lactant. inflit. l. 2. c. 15. Capel. in ^^pt. philol. Chalcid in
Tim^. Plat. Zephyr in Tertull. ^pol. and alij Ineptu^ est enim quod a (...)
Ebr. Io. Bodin. in daemonol. deducit: sicut and quod (...) quasi (...), quod
sanguine gaudeant dictos vult Lasocius de rebus Mosco.
in Greek he has his name,) as also of his long experience adioined
thereunto. And no marvel. For Saepe quae naturalibus signi^ futura
praenoscunt, quae signa in hominum sensus venire non possunt, ante praedicunt:
neque tamen qui^ praeuidet medicus, quod non praeuidet eius artis ignarus, id^o
iam diuiu^^ habendus est. Quid autem mirum, s^ quemadmodu^ ille incorporis
humani vel perturbata vel modificata temp^rie seu bona^ seu malas futuras
praeuidet valetudines, sic Demon in aeri^ affection^ atque ordinatione sibi
nota^, nobis igno^as futuras praeuidet tempestates? etc. Aug. de divine. dam. c.
5.
if a skillful Physician can by reason of his skill say much more of the state
of his Patient and the likelihood or unlikelihood of his recovery, then an
ignorant man or some other ordinary person is able to do; and Accessit
daemonibus per tam longum t^mpus rerum long mayor experientia: hinc and multa
futura praedicunt, mira fa^iunt. Aug. de divine. daem. c ^. Diuturna rerum
experientia q^emadmodu^ praenoscant atque praenuncient m^lta, didiceru^t, sicut
sons p^ura exp^ti, etc. Idem ibid. c. 4. and de ciuit. Dei l. 9. c. 22.
old men, by reason of their long experience can tell and foretell many things
on good ground preconiectured by observation of men's usual courses and
cariages, then the younger sort commonly can: no marvel if Satan termed for
his subtlety Genesis 3.1. 2. Cor. 11 3.
a Serpent, for his antiquity, Ap^c. 12 9.
an old Serpent, of above 5000. years continuance, be able to guess probably
at many things, that men can see or say little of. And 1. Sam. 28* 15, 16, 19,
5, 6. (...). G^^gor. Nyss.
so might he foretell Saul, seeing how things then stood with him, what was
likely to befall him: that which a man even of mean and ordinary capacity
might at that time have given a shrewd guess at.

Again Extraordinarily he may more certainly foresee and fore-shew, what he
has or hears from God or the servants of God; or what he is permitted to
do, or is employed about by God.

First what he has heard Dei dispositiones saepe praesen^iunt, cui^s ministri
fuerunt. Lacta ^t instit. l. 2. c. 17. diuinis enim saepe intersunt consilijs,
^um ad imp^rata facien^a vocentur. Job 1.6. Martyr in 1. Samuel cap 28.

Tertull. apol^g.
the Prophets of God, Ephesians 3.10.
whom the very Angels also learn somethings from: as 2. Sam. 18.24, 25.
one sitting on the ground or abiding within, may have news privily imparted
to him from the watchman standing on the sentinel or watch-towre without,
which he may relate to others, as by vision or apparition seeing and
discovering them himself: And thus might he foretell as 1. Sam. 28.17* illa
dicit, quae saepe ex Samuele audierat. Procop. in 1. Reg. c. 28.
Saul's downe-fall, so Cur non potuit demon praedicero, quod per prophetas ^ibi
praenos^eret imminere? Aug. de divine. daem. c. 7. Ex prophetarum
praedictionibus praenoscere and Hermeti praedicere potuit. Id. de ciuit. Dei l.
8^ c. 23.
his own fall, which he is said sometime to have done: yea thus coming to the
notice of many future events, under color of prophetical divination has he
drawn unto himself divine adoration.

Secondly what he is permitted to do by God, or what he is employed for the
doing of from GOD; what Plaerumque praenunctant, quae ipsi facturi sunt.
August. de divine. daem. c 5.
he is about to do Aut missi a Deo, aut permissi. Idem.
by the permission of God, or is bound to do by special commission from God.

For Accipiunt saepe potestatem and morbos immittere, and aerem ipsum vitiando
morbidum reddere, and peruersis terrenoru^ amatoribus malefacta suadere, de
quorum moribus certi sunt, quod sint eis talia suaedentibus consensuri.
Augustine, de divine. d^mon. cap. 5. Job 1.12, 15, 17, 19. and 2.6, 7.
evil Spirits are many times by God permitted to do much mischeife both
corporally and spiritually, by inflicting of maladies and infecting the air,
or by enciting and egging men on to evil courses, with whom knowing their
disposition they doubt not to prevail and to persuade them thereunto Hence
they take occasion oft-times Dispositiones suas aliquando praen^nciant.
Augustine. de ciuitat^ Dei lib. 9. cap. 22.
to foretell what themselves are about to do, or will draw others unto; and to
bear men in hand, when they can do no more mischief, being near the end of
their tedder, that Laedunt primo; de^inc remedia praecipiunt ad miraculum noua

they help or heal them, because they leave hurting them; or, Cum finem sibi

v^l illud fiat. Martyr in 1. Sam. cap. 28.
because they cannot get leave to molest them any longer, that their evils at
such a time shall have an end, if such and such fooleries be performed.

Sometime again Omnipotens iustusque Deus and bonis vtitur ad opera congrua,
and malis ad opera dign^, August. ad Simplic. l. 2. q. 6.
they are employed by God to this purpose: For Diabolus Dei car^ifex est.
Martyr in 1. Sam. 28. (...). Plut. de sera number. vindict. (...). Synes. Epist.
57.
the Devil is Gods Executioner, whom he makes often good use of. So he used 1.
King. 22.22.
an evil Spirit (not R. Ioanan in Talmud ex sententia R. Rabina and R. Popa.
the soul of Naboth, as the doting Rabbines dream) to entice Ahab out to his
ruin: So he used Psalm. 78.49. (...) malignos angelos, i. occultos aer^os
spiritus. Aug.^n I sh. q. 24. and in Psalm. 104. and alij plaerique.
evil Spirits, as the most think, for the plaguing of Egypt: (though Nuncios
maloru^, i. Mosen and Aar^n. Iun.
some expound the Psalmist otherwise; and it is against the rule that some
Malos per bon^^ bonos per malos^ Merlin. in Job c. 1^
others give that God is wont to afflict good men by bad Angels, and bad men
by good Angels:) yea thus it is evident that he used one of them for the
vexing of Saul, styled therefore in the text, 1 Sa. 16.14, 15.
an evil Angel of God: Just quaeritur, si Domini, cur malus si malus, cur
Domini dicitur? Sed (...) verbis comprehensa est potestas iusta ind ab^lo and

an evil Spirit in regard of his malicious quality, and yet a Spirit of God,
because an Executioner of Gods justice, as the Ancients have well observed.
And Possunt praedicere, quae D^us illis, vt saepe fit imperat facienda. Martyr
in 1. Sam 28.
thus may the Devil further foretell, what God himself has set him or sent
him about: as he might well by that mean also read 1. Sam. 28.19.
Saul's destiny, Ita hic praedicat Saulo postridie moriendum, qui in mancipio
and peculio Diabo^i iam erat. Martyr ibid.
as ones that God had given over and given up into his hands.

Now in these cases, wherein such evil Spirits have an hand, (...). Justin.
quaest. orthod. q. 146. (...). Ibid.
the events of them fall not out always alike; by reason that sometime In
praedictionibus suis daemones quandoque falluntur, cum causis naturalibus
aliqua, vt medici, nautae, agricolae, sed acutius long, praenoscunt, quae ex
dispositione aliqua ipsis ignota ex improuiso mutantur, etc. Aug. de divine.
daem. c 6.
they fail, notwithstanding their skill, in those things that by their
natural wisdom and subtilty they foresee in the secret causes or signs of
them, when God by some extraordinary course turns things about, and
controlleth the ordinary carriage of the creature: As the Patient sometime dies
through some inward accident unexpected, where the Physician according to the
rules and grounds of his Art saw no signs but of safety: or as if a Mariner
upon good grounds of observation should give his opinion, that that storm of
wind should last long that Matthew. 8.26.
Christ suddenly calmed: Or an Husbandman should promise much fruit of a vine
such a year, judging according to his skill, which should afterward either be
blasted with lightning, or rooted up by some wild beast breaking into the
Vineyard: And so these unclean Spirits, notwithstanding all their skill and
experience, fail often in their predictions, when some greater power ouerswaieth
that that they builded upon.

Falluntur etiam, quia cum dispositiones suas praenunciant, ex improuiso
desuper a^iquid iubetur, quod eorum consilia cuncta perturbet. Aug. ibid.
They fail also in those things that they are enjoined and set or sent about
by God; when Ierem 18.7, 8, 9, 10.
God altreth his courses, and either reuoketh his sentence, as with Esai 38.1,
5.
Ezekias, as with I^na 3.4, 10.
the Nineuites; or gives a countermaund, as Genesis 22.2, 12.
to Abraham, about the sacrificing of Isaak: which is Velut si quid disponant
homines potes^^tibus subditi, quod non prohibitur^^ suos praeposit^s
arbitrantur, idque factur^s se promittant: at illirepente prohibeant. Aug. vbi

as if the Judge should send suddenly and unexpectedly to repriue a Prisoner
whom he had condemned, when the Executioner were ready to do his office with
him, and made full account to make sale of his spoils.

9. Thus then have we seen how by Satan's help such superstitious Diuinations
and predictions may either fail or hold: Now further in the last place those
things that in this kind take effect, come to pass by Gods permission and
providence indeed always, but by his permission for special purpose sometime,
and sometime for diverse causes by his special ordination and appointment,
which no Devil nor creature therefore can cross.

First by Permission for special purpose; and that (...). V^itur his Dominus
vel ad damnationem, vel ad em^ndationem, vel ad probationem. Aug. ad Simplic l.
2. q. 1. ad vindictam malorum, ad disciplinam bonorum. Ibid.
either for the trial and exercise of some, or for the punishment of other
some.

For the trial of some, to try whether they will heed such superstitions as
these are, as the crowing and croaking of Ravens, the shreiking of Owls, this
kind of Lotery, and the like. To which purpose D^ut. 13.1, 2, 3. Obijciunt
nobis saepe euenire quae sorts diuinatoriae praedicunt. Respondeo quod Dominus
de pseudopropheta etc. La^at. in Prou. 16. Ab hoc fornicationis genere
Scriptura non sic deterruit ^nimam, vt propterea talia negaret esse sectanda,
quia falsa dicuntur a professoribus eoru^; sed etiamsi dixerint, ^vobis,
inquit, and ita euenerit, ne ^^edatis eis. Aug. de doctr. Christ. l. 2. c. 23.
God forewarning his people to beware of those that assay by evil courses to
withdraw them from God, he does not tell them, that they shall not heed them,
unless they see things fall out accordingly as they foretell them; but, though
they do set them some sign, and it come to pass accordingly, yet they shall
not give heed to them; For that Permittit ista Diabolo Deus ad probandos
Christisnos. Aug. de temp. sermon. 241. Etiamsi praestiterit, nec praesta^ti
credideris. Permisit Deus hoc posse, non vt animu^ tuu^ nosset, sed vt ^^bi
probationis occasione^ praeberet, vtrum vere Deu^ diligere^. Est autem amantis,
etiamsi exanimes ad vita^ reuocet, qui ab amato conatur abstrahere, nequaqua^
tame^ ab amato de^icere. Chrysostom. cant. I^d l. 2.
God suffers it so to do, to try them, whether they do indeed so love him,
and sit so close to him, as that they will not by such superstitious means,
though falling out as was foretold them, be drawn away from him.

Again for the just punishment of some others; that they may be whipped and
scourged with a rod of their own making, with a cord of their own twisting.
For therefore does God suffer these things ofttimes to take effect, that 2 Thessalonians. 2.9, 10, 11, 12. Fiunt ad imagines miraculae nonnunquam operatione
daemonu^ ad fallendu^ in^rdinatos cultores, D^o permittente, exigente talium
infidelitate. Gabr. Biel in Caenon miss. lect. 49. Punit Deus h^c modo hominum
superstitione^, vt multa euenire patiaetur. Lauat in Prou. 16. Vt cum interdu^
per sacrilegia illa remedia aliqua percipere, vel veru^ aliquid deprehendere
potuerint, facilius propterea Diabolo credant. Aug. de temp. ser. 241. Vt
illusionis efficacia magis in^s^entur, qui malignis spiritibus magis quam verbo
ipsius credere in animum induxerunt. Gualter. in Ion. c. 1.
they may be given up to strong delusions to believe lies, that loved not the
truth; that they may be further entangled in Satan's snares, that would rather
give heed to him then to God: that Non est falsa aut vana taliu^ notitia: per
effectum enim veritas probatur. Non negamus. Sicut enim vera fides miraculis,
vbi opus est, meretur dotari, ita falsa fides portentis vel figmentis in sui
damnatione^ demeretur illudi. Gerson de mag. error. par. 3.
as Gods children have been sometime by true miracles and the predictions of
Gods Prophets confirmed in their holy Faith: so such wicked Wretches may by
counterfeit miracles and diabolical predictions be, with Exo. 7.11, 12, 13, 22.
Pharao, hardened in their false belief.

And therefore, do we see such superstitious courses often take effect, and to
have their event answerable to their expectations that use them? Let us
remember, that, as sin the more successful it is, the more dangerous it is
for the Sinner: so in this case, Effectu^ talia sortiri experientiae multae
probant. Sed notanter Augustinus, omnes tales obseruationes tanto magis
suspectas and fugiendas esse, quanto saepius suu^ videntur sortiri effectum.
Gerson astrol. theolog. prop. 21. Si superstitiosa haec reperiantur esse
virtutis alicuius tanto perniciosiora sunt secundum A^gustinum, quanto sunt ad
seducendum validiora. Idem de error. mag. part. 3.
the oftener such courses take effect, the more perilous they are, because the
more powerful to prevail, if we be not the wiser and the more wary, and in
that regard the rather to be suspected and shunned of us.

Secondly by Gods special ordination and appointment, do these things
sometime so fall out, to work his own ends by the wickedness of others. For
Operatur Deus per creaturam aliquando sine ipsa, aliquando contra ipsam,
aliquando cum ipsa. Bern. de great. and lib. arb.
God works even by them that work contrary to him; and Eius enim consilijs
militant, etiam qui eius consilijs repugnant. Greg. M. mor. l. 6. c. 14.
they fight his battles, even that fight against him.

Now thus does God give success to these things, though evil in themselves,
and as they are used, sometime for the punishment of those that deserve to be
punished, and his will is to have either destroyed or corrected; and those
either the users of them or others.

The Users of them, as 1. Sam. 14.38, 39, 40.
in the Lot cast by Saul that lighted on Jonathan, Hic est fructus humanarum
traditionum, vt and alijs and saepe autoribus suis molestae sint. Martyr in 1.
Sam. c. 14.
to punish Saul thereby for his unadvised adiuration and presumptuous
inquisition, and to show Vise Chrysostom. ad pop. Antioc. ser 14.
what streights men wilfully cast themselves into by such idle, rash,
unnecessary and inordinate oaths: as 1. Sam. 28.19. (...). Justin. orthod.
quaest. 52. Quandoque enim v^lt Deus etiam per spiritus inferuos alique^ vera
cognoscere, ad eorum poena^ quibus ista praedicuntur, vt malum quod eis
impendet, antequam veniat, praenoscendo patiantur. August. ad Simpl. l 2. q. 3.
for this cause also it seems that he suffered the Devil to foretell Saul
his overthrow, thereby to punish him for that his impious act by deiectio^
before hand, as he did afterward by death.

Or some others; as Iona. 1.7.
in the Lot that lighted on Jonas; of which Hierome says well, that N^n statim
debemus sub hoc exemplo sortibus credere, vel illud de Actibus huic testimonio
copulare. Cum priuilegia singuloru^ non possint legem facere communem. Sicut
enim in condemnatione^ Balaam a^ina loquitur Number. 22.28, 30. and Pharao Genesis
41. and Nebuc. Dan. 2. and 4. in iudiciu^ sui so^^ijs futura cognoscunt: sic
fugitiuus deprehenditur non viribus sortiu^ and maxim ethnitoru^, sed
voluntate eius qui sorts regebat incertas. Hieron. super Ion. c. 1.
We ought not in that regard to give heed or credit to Lots in the like case
(for how know we that God has still the like work or end to work; or that
he is willing ever so to work?) or to match it with that Lot that we read of
in the Ad bonum finem vsus aliorum malitia. Riber. in Ion. quod and Lyra. Vise
and Theophyl. sup. cap. 10.. 5.
Acts used in the choice of Matthias. (As reasoning from the lawfulness of the
one to the other) since that singular privileges make no common Law: and Act.
1.26.
God used well that course that was familiar with them, and wherein they did
evil, for the finding out and fetching back of his fugitive servant: as Ezech.
^1.19, 24, 25, 26.
he did Nebuchadnezars idolatrous diuinations, and his Lotery of the like kind;
which himself also by his own Prophets foretold that he would make good for
the just and well deserved punishment of his perverse and perjured both Prince
and people.

Again sometime God gives way and event to these courses, for the
manifestation of his own glory, his power, and his providence; to let men see
discovered to them by their own proiects, though evil and impious, who it is
that plagueth them, and has power over them, though they either know not, or
acknowledge not him. And so was it 1. Sam. 6.7, 8, 6, 10. Vt suo eos ^re
corrip^ret. Chrysostom. in Tit. homil. 3. vt ostenderet malum illud a se
profectu^. Riber in Ion. c. 1. vt gloria illis sua innetesceret. Martyr in 1.
Sam c. 6.
in that sign that the Philistine Soothsayers set themselves; whereby God put
them out of doubt of that concerning his hand on them, which they made some
doubt of before. Where we may withal consider, that as these courses took
effect when God had such an hand in them; so the like courses used by others,
as by Esai 36.10. and 37.36.
Haman, and by Ester 3.7. and 9.1, 2.
Senacharib, at other times failed and took not effect, but fell out clean
contrary, (...). Esa. 36.18, 19, 20. (...). Esai 36.10. and 37.29, 33, 34
Justin. orthodox. quaest. 136.
when God pleased not to give success unto them, or had not (and who can tell
when he has?) any such ends in them. Considering therefore, that there can be
no certainty, in such Lotery, unless that God himself have a special hand in
it, which Insulsum enim plane quod Serar. in I^sh. tom. 2. c. 7. q. 19. Vim
^nesse sortibus ad veritate^ eruendam, ex concursu diuino, si non in speciali,
saltem in generali cursu certo, speciali incerto, de quo tamen spes aliqua
affulget, quia sortium vsum aliquando laudauit. Non enim iuuat Deus aut
promouet, quae abominatur and damnat: vt recte Peu^eo. de divine.
we have no reason to expect, unless it be for our evil, to plague us for
our perverse courses in that kind; as also that In ^aeteris autem
praedictionibus suis daemones plaerumque and falluntur and fallunt. Aug de
divine. daem. c 6. Vt and nescientes sinceram veritatem, and quaem seiunt, in
perditionem sui non confitentes Minut. Foelix in Octaui^
the Devil, as he may be deceived, so he may deceive us; yea from a professed
and notorious Deceiuer we can expect nothing but deceit, whether he himself
be deceived or not: Let us take heed how we give heed or credit to, such
deceipts as seldom prove true; yea how we give any regard to them, though they
prove never so often true: remembering that Non enim quiae imago Samuelis mortua
Sauli regi v^ra praenunciauit, 1. Sam. 28.19. pro^terea taliae sacrilegia minu^
sunt execranda: aut quia Act. 16.16, 17, 18. ventriloqua foemina verum
testimonium perhibuit Apostolis Domini; ideo Paulus pepercit illi spiritui, ac
non foeminam illam daemonis correptione atque exclusione mundauit. Aug. de
doctr. Christ. l. 2 c. 23.
Saul's witchcraft was not therefore the more allowable, because the Devil told
him nothing but truth; nor the Apostles of Christ ever a whit the more spared
the unclean Spirits, because they told truly what they were; yea bearing ever
in mind that Deuteronomy. 13.1, 2, 3.
God has forewarned us before hand, that though they should prove true, yet we
should not believe them, nor give credit unto them, as being but sleights of
Satan to draw or drive us away from him; yea such sorry flights these, that even
Tota res (sortiu^) est inuenta fallaci^s aut ad quaestum, aut ad superstitio.
nem, aut ad errore^. Cicer. de di^in. l. 2. Sed hoc genus diuinationis vita
iam. communis explosit. Quis enim magistra^us, aut quis vir illustri^r vtitur
sortibus? Plaerisqu^ in locis sorts plane refrixerunt. Ibid.
the wiser sort of the heathen ones have descried and discovered the folly and
vanity of them; and it is a foul shame for Christian men to come short of
such. And thus much may suffice also for these latter sort of Lots, to wit,
Extraordinary and Diuinatory, Lots, which howsoever they have been lawful
some of them at some times unto some, yet are none of them lawful in these
times unto any.

10. To end where we began. Prou. 25.4.
Take the dross, says Solomon, from the silver, and there will be a vessel
sit for the siner. So take the ordinary abuse from the ordinary Lot, and it
will prove an ordinance of no evil use. Neither are the use and the abuse of it
so mixed together, but that men may, if they will, sever them the one from the
other. As for the extraordinary Lot, the very ordinary use of that Lot is a
mere abuse of a Lot: and it is therefore, as drossie matter, that will not
endure the Finers fire, but runs all to smoke or ashes when it comes to
the assay, utterly to be rejected. There may be superstition as well in the
condemning of the one, as in the approving of the other. Let the one therefore
go, as it well deserves, to the dunghill: let the other be so wisely and
warily used, that God be not dishonored, who has given us the free use of
them; nor our brethren offended or wronged, for whose good God has given us
them; nor our selves hindered in better things, that more nearly concern us,
and whereunto these things should be as furtherances unto us.

FINIS.
