Here begins a short treatise of contemplacyon taught by our lord Jhesu
christ / or taken out of the book of Margerie kempe of lyn^.

She desired many times that her head might be smyten of with an axe upon a
block for the love of our lord Ihesu. Then said our lord Ihesu in her
mind. I thank the daughter that thou would dye for my love / for as often
as thou thy^kest so thou shall staue the same mede in heaven / as if thou
suffredest the same death / and yet there shall no man slay the.

I assure ye in thy mind / if it were possible me to suffer pain again / as
I have done before / me were lever to suffer as much pain as ever I did for
thy soul alone / rather than thou sholdest depart fro me everlasting.

Daughter thou may no better please god than to thy^ke contynually in his
love. Than she asked our lord Ihesu christ / how she should best love him

And our lord said / have mind of thy wyckednes and think on my goodness.

Daughter if thou were the haberyon / or ye here fasting bread and water / and
if you saydeste every day a thousand pater nr^. thou should not please me so
well as thou do when you art in scylence / and suffrest me to speak in thy
soul

Daughter for to bid many bedes / it is good to them that cannot better do /
and yet it is not profit. But it is a good way toward perfeccyon. For I tell
the daughter / they that be great fasters / and great doers of penance. they
would that it should be hold the best life / And they that give them to many
deuocyons / they would have that ye best life. And tho that given much alms
/ they would that it were holden the best life. And I have often told ye
daughter / that thynky^ge / weeping / and hye co^templacyon is ye best life in
earth / and thou shall have more merit in heaven for one year thinking in thy
mind than for an hundred year of prayeng with thy mouth and yet thou will not
believe me. for thou will bid many bedes.

Daughter if thou knew how sweet thy love is to me / you would never do other
thing but love me with all thy heart.

Dought if thou wylt be hye with me in heaven keep me always in thy mind as much
as you may and forgete not me at thy mete / but think always yt I fyt in thy
heart and know every thought yt is therein both good and badde.

Daughter I have suffered many pains for thy love / therefore you have great cause
to love me right well for I have bought thy love full dear.

Dear lord I pray the late me never have other Joy in earth but mourning and
weeping for thy love / for me thinks lord / though I were in hell / if I
might weep there and mourn for thy love as I do here / hell should not noye me
/ but it should be a manner heaven / for thy love puts away al manner of dread
of our gostly enemy / for I had lever be there as long as you would and
please the / than to be in this world and dysplease the / therefore good lord
as thou will so mote it be.

She had great wonder that our lord would become man / and suffer so grievous
pains for her yt was so unkind a creature to him. And than with great wepy^ge
she asked our lord Ihu^ how she might best please hy^. and he answered to
her soul saying daughter have mind of thy wyckednes and think on my goodness
/ than she prayed many times and often these words. Lord for thy goodness have
merci on my great wyckednes / as certeynly as I was never so wicked as you art
good ne never may be though I would. for you art so good yt you may no better
be and therefore it is great wonder yt ever any man should be departed fro the
without end.

When she saw the crucyfyxe / or if she saw a man had a wound or a best. Or
if a man beat a child before her / or smote an horse / or an other best with a
whype / if she might se it or here it. she thought she saw our lord beten or
wounded like as she saw in the man or in the best.

The more she increased in love and in devotion / the more she increased in
sorrow and contrycyon / in lowness and meekness / and in holy dread of our
lord Ihesu and in knowledge of her own freylte. So that if she saw any
creature be punysshed / or sharply chastysed / she would think that she had been more worthy to be chastysed than yt creature was for her unkindness against
god. Than would she weep for her own sin. and for compassyon of that
creature.

In no thing that you do or say daughter you may no better please god
/ than believe that he loves the. For if it were possible yt I might weep with
the. I would weep with the for the compassyon yt I have of the.

Our merciful lord Ihesu christ drew this creture unto his love / and to the
mind of his passion / that might not endure to behold a lepre / or an other
seek man / specially if he had any wou^des apperynge on him. So she wept as
if she had seen our lord Ihesu with his wounds bledy^ge: and so she did in
the sight of the soul / for through the beholdynge of the seek man / her mind
was all rauysshed in to our lord Ihesu / that she had great mourning and
sorowy^ge yt she might not kiss ye lepre when she met them in the way for the
love of our lord which was all contrary to her desposycyon in the years of
her youth and prosperyte / for than she abhorred them most.

Daughter you haste desired in thy mind to have many priests in the town of
lyn^ / that might sy^ge and read night and day for to serve me / worship me /
and praise me / and thank me for the goodness yt I have do to the in earth / and
therefore daughter I promise the thou shall have mede and reward in heaven for
the good wylles and good desires / as if thou had done them in deed.

Daughter you shalt have as great mede and as great reward with me in heaven.
for thy good service and thy good deeds that thou haste do in thy mind as if
thou had do ye same with thy bodily wits without forth.

And daughter I thank the / for the charity that thou haste to all lecherous
men and wy^men / for thou prayest for them and wepest for them many atere
desiring yt it should deliver them out of sin / and be as gracyous to them
as I was to Mary maudeleyne / yt they might have as much grace to love me as
Mary maudeleyne had / and with this condyco^n you would yt eueryche of them
should have.xx. li. a year to love and praise me / and daughter this great
charity which you have to them in thy prayer pleases me right well / And
daughter also I thank the for ye charity which you have in thy prayer when you
prayest for all Jews and sarasyns / and al hethen people yt they should come
to christian faith / yt my name might be magnyfyed in them Furthermore daughter I
thank the for general charity yt you have to al people that be now in this
world / and to al tho that. are to come unto the worlds end / yt thou
would be hacked as small as flesh to the pot for their love / so yt I
would by thy death save them all fro dampnaco^n if it pleased me. And therefore
daughter / for all these good wylles and desires thou shall have full mede and
reward in heaven believe it right well and doubt never a dele.

She said good lord I would be laid naked upon an hurdel for thy love al men
to wonder on me and to cast fylth and dyrt on me: and be drawn fro town to
town every day my life time if you were pleased thereby / and no man's soul
hyndred / thy will be fulfilled and not mine.

Daughters as oftentimes as you say or thy^kest worshypped be all the holy
places in Iherusalem where christ suffer bitter pain and passion in thou shall
have have the same pardon as if you were with thy bodily presence / both to thy
self and to all the yt thou wylt give to.

The same pardon yt was granted the before time. it was confermed on saint
Nycolas day / yt is to say / plain remyssyon / and it is not only granted to
ye / but also to all tho yt believe / and to all tho yt shall believe unto the
worlds end / that god loves ye / and shall thank god for the if they will
forsake their sin / and be in full will no more to turn again thereto. But
be sorye and heavy for yt they have done and will do due penance therefore /
they shall have the same pardon yt is granted to thy self. and yt is all ye
pardon yt is in Ierlm / as was granted ye when you were at Rafnys.

That day that she suffered no trybulacyon for our lords sake she was not
merry ne glad / as that day when she suffered trybulacyon.

Pacyence is more worth than miracles doing

Daughter it is more pleasure to me yt thou suffer despytes / scorns / shames /
and repreues / wro^ges / dyseases / than if thine head were stryken three times
a day every day in seven year.

Lord for thy great pain have mercy on my little pain.

When she was in great trouble / our lord said / daughter I must needs
comfort ye. for now you have ye right way to heaven / By this way came I and all
my dyscyples / for now you shall know ye better what sorrow and shame I suffered
for thy love / and you shalt have the more compassyon when thou thynkest on my
passion.

O my dear worthy lord: these graces you sholdest show to relygyous men and to
prestes.

Our lord said to her again / nay nay daughter / for yt I love best yt they
love not / and yt is shames / repreues / scorns / and despytes of ye people /
and therefore they shall not have this grace / for daughter he that dredeth ye
shames of this world may not parfyghtly love god.
