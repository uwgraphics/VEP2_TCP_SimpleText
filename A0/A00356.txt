De immensa dei misericordia.

A sermon of the exceeding great mercy of god / made by ye most famous doctor
master Eras. Rot. Translated out of Latin in to Englisshe / at the request of
the most honorable and virtuous lady / the lady Margaret Countese of Salisbury.

To the most honorable lady the lady Cou^tese of Salisbury Gentian Heruet her
humble servant gretyng.
Seeing and understanding most honorable lady your great mind and deep
affection both toward al manner of lernyng / and specially toward that /
which either exciteth or teaches virtue and goodness / and concerns the way
of our salvation / I have translated out of Latin in to english a sermon of
Erasmus of the mercy of god: the which translated for you / and dedicate unto
your ladyshyp, I thought it should be a good deed / if for your ladisshyps
pleasure it were printed and spread abroad: And where as before learned me^ only
did get out both pleasure and great fruit in redyng of this book / now every
man as well rude as learned may have this sermon of the mercy of god as common
unto him as ye mercy of god it self is. And as touching ye co^me^dacion either
of the author or of ye warke, I know the te^dernes of my wit much more sle^der
tha^ that I can be able to bear the weight of such an enterprise, and I reke^
to be much better to hold my tongue utterly from y^ preysyng / tha^ of them to
speak to littel, and for fault of wit to minishe their excelle^ce. Yet
nethelesse it seems expedient unto me, yt by your ladishyp brefly other folk
may know how noble is the author of this warke / and how much we be bound to
him for it. The author of the book is Erasmus Roterodamus / whom my preyses can
no more ennoble / tha^ the son with a candel may be made clerer. He is the man
/ to whom in learning no living man may him self compare: and not only passes
them that be alive / but also from the most part of old autors has beraft ye
price / and not only payne^s and gentyls but also Chrsten doctors. He is ye
man that when in his first days troth was far hyd in the deep veins of the
ground / and more over it was prohibited as a thing being worthy death yt no
man should for her enquere, he did not suffer the world to be confounded with
such a marvelous darkness, and either he has dygged up many ^y^mes of troth
/ or at the lest he has restored us free liberty to search her. He is the man
that to Isaac may be compared / the which dygged up the goodly spryngyng
wells / that the Philiste^s distroied and with dyrte and donge ouerfylled. The
clear springes of the holy scripture / that ye Philistie^s had so troubled / so
marred / and so defiled / yt no man could drink or have the true taste of the
water / they be now by his labor and diligence to their old pureness and
clerenes so restored yt no spotte nor erthly fylthe in them remains. And
though ye Philistie^s did all that they could to disturb him from his holy
purpose / and yt among the people by the reason of them / he was greatly hated
and envied / yet at the last as it chances always unto them that with a bold
stomach in their good deeds do continue / excellent virtue has overcome envy /
when from this man there can come out nothing but both it is excedyng
profitable and on every side all perfect / me thinks yt this litell treatise
being in every point as perfect as any other be in profit / not only gives no
place but also greatly passes: for where before the warkes that he made were
profitable but specially to one kind of men / his Proverbs / his New
Testament / and many other treatyses only to learned men / of the book of ye
Instruction of princis ye most profit redu^deth to princes. This book only
with the book called ye knife or wepo^ of a Christian ^owdiour has so far
spredde abroad his fruteful branches, that there is no man but great fruit
gether he may out of it / except he that thinks that it makes no matter
whether he be dampened or saved. And as for the knyfe of a Christian sowdiour
which he names Enchiridion, it brings a man out of the way of vicis / and
leads him in the way of virtue and the path of salvation. This littel
treatise of the mercy of god teaches a man to ascribe nothing to him self /
but all to gether to the mercy of god / seeing that the fre will it self that we
be indewed with all / is the fre gift of almighty god / and except it were by
him made clerer / it should be so dark with the rust of the original sin,
that ye image of virtue in it should never be fast printed. And who so ever
being entered in to ye kingdom of god by bap^yme does ascribe any thing to his
own wisdom / to his merits, and to his deservings / and not aknowlegeth
every where his own feebleness / trusting upon ye fre grace and mercy of
almighty god / it is to be drade / leest for mercy that is every where ready for
him that calls / he prove the sore and rigorous justice of god. Now let us
se whither it be more expedient for a mannis salvation, either by justice to be
feared from sin, or by mercy to be enticed both to love and to virtue.
Justice with her sore thretnynges co^pelleth a man to flee vice / and
enge^dreth in him a certain bo^dly fear / that it is an odious thing unto him
to commit sin / not for ye hate it self of sin, but for fear of
punisheme^t. Mercy contrary to it puts before a man's face the unspeakable
love of god toward him, ye which so loved him, that he did not spare his
only son for his sake / the incredible benefits / the infinite desire of
his salvation / the continual calling upon him to bring him to the
everlasting bliss. Of ye other side she shows him as if it were in a glass
/ the weakness and feebleness of a man / the perilles that he is compassed about
with, the calamites, the miseri, ye wretchedness that on every side do utterly
him wrappe, and that in so many mischeues, there comes no succor but fro the
mercy of god / do not all these enge^dre in him a certain childyshe love
toward his father / that he will perform his commandments / not for fear
of punishment / nor for love of reward, but for because it pleases his most
loving father? And that he accounted this a very great reward to do the thing
that does like such a good father. And where as it is said that ye fear of
our lord is the beginning of wisdom / though the same fear somewhat
concerns the dread of justice / yet I reken that it is not to be taken for
that bondly fear yt makes us to dread the sore punysheme^tes, but for that
that makes us to look about / that we do nothing that should displease our
most loving father, orels fear with out love longs to a cruel tyrant / that
cares not for the peoples hatred, so they fear him / and not to ye most
merciful lord and father of us all / whose love toward mankind neither with
mind can be comprehended nor with words any thing expressed. The which
seeing that he loves us so much, and that all our help and soccour comes
from him / let us set al our trust and confidence in him, withdrawyng al our
trust and our hope from al mortal things / and from al mortal me^. If we be in
need / let us call upon him, he is benign / he is liberal / he gives gladlier
than other do take / if so y^ we make him not a nygarde in askyng of small
things and unworthy of him to be given. If we be in sin let us call upon his
mercy / being sorry and repenta^t. When so ever a sinner is truly repe^tant he
forgyueth al manner of sin. Here among me^ they yt do forgive syn have not al
an egall power: some cases be reserved to ye pope / and of ye popes him selle
power some do put a great dout: but god him self is he yt has rule both in
heaven and in earth, there is no dout yt of his autorite and power can be made.
If we desire to come to the everlasting felicite / and eschew the fearful
peynes of hell / let us beseech his mercy to keep us from sin / and give us
strength to ^ulfyll his will and his co^mand^me^tes / and so done / let us put
us al holle to his pleasure and mercy / and let us not trust upon certain vain
prayers / the which with much error be spread among me^, as though they had
this virtue and power / yt who so ever mu^bleth them up shall eschew
euerlasty^g punysheme^tes. O subtle serpent / o disceitfull devil, how
various, how crafty be thyn imaginacio^s? because he sees yt from our simple
and steadfast believe he can not bring us away / he goth about to bring us in to
an odious supersticiousnes / and because he sees that that man can not do
amiss / yt upon the mercy of god sets his holle trust / he persuadeth rude
and ignorant foles to set their trust upon vain things, that they should set
only upon god. Surely such he is / and he will never cease to let us from our
journey heue^ward / out of which place he was overthrown. But the mo wiles
and subtilties yt he works / the more grace and strength god gives us to
withstand him. But it is time most honorable lady to lay by my rude and
vn^loque^t la^gage, yt ye may here Erasmus speak eloque^tly / and in your own
mothers tongue very plainly, the which so commends to the herers ye
unmeasurable and infinite mercy of god / yt who so ever in his heart fast
printeth it, he shall find out of it a marvelous great fruit both to know his
own misery / and of god the infinite bou^te / yt which two things be most
effectuous to direct us to the eue^las^ynge f^lycite / that is Christ Jesus /
the which preserve your lady^shyppe and all yours.

AMEN.
A sermon of the excedyng great mercy of god made by Erasmus Roterodamus.
FOr as much as I purpose this day to speak of the greatness of the mercies
of our lord / Brethren and systerne most well-beloved in Christ / without whose
help ma^s frailte and weakness can naught do: let us all to gether with a
common prayer beseech the mercy of the common lord of us all / so to move the
instrument of my tongue / and so to stere and kendell your hearts / that as we
shall depart hence through the mercy of our lord more plentiouslye endewed
with heavenly grace: so every man to his neighbourwarde may more abundantly use
the warkes of mercy. Some use here to great the virgin mo^her / I deny not
every where much honor ought to be given her / but verily to our purpose now
me seems more expedi^nt / if ye follow me thus going before you:

Jesus Christ the almyghtye word of the everlasting father / that promysest
to be present / where so ever two or three were assembled in thy name / thou
see how many in thy name be here gethered. Uouchesafe therefore according to
the promise / to be among this company: that their hearts lyghted through
grace of the holy ghost / may understand more fully the greatness of thy
mercy: whereby we al to gether may with a lustier mind both yield to the
thanks for thy mercy / that so often has been to us showed / and that more
desyrouslye in all our necessites / we may call thereon for help: and lastely
that we humble servants may the mercy of our lord / that un us we have
largely proved / to our power louyngly prosecute on our fellows like wise
servants.

If that every man (as the rhetoriciens teach) is right dilligent and attentive
to here those things / that he understands should sharply touch him: than
there ought none of you to nodde or sleep in this sermon time / seeing that the
salvation of us allegally depends on the mercy of our lord: Nor there is
none so young nor so old / of so low or so high birth / so poor nor so rich
/ so bo^de nor so fre, so counnyng nor so rude, so wicked nor so just / but
that he has often times both proved the mercy of our lord / and needs the
mercy of our lord to all things that he rightously goth about. What matter
more favorable may be treated / than that by the mercy of god / everlasting
health is prepared for all folks? Of very right therefore i^ this sermon time /
as many as be here present / ye should not only take heed, but also be lusty
and glad to here hit: for who so ever does love and fauer him self / woll
love and fauer this sermon.

Among the manyfolde yuels / which draw mankind to everlasting da^nacion /
there be two chief and pryncipall myscheues: of which they ought specially
to be ware / that love virtue and goodness / and desire to come to the
feloweshyp of euerlasty^g felicite. They be these, To much trust on ones own
self and Dispeire. The one comes of a presumptuous mind against god / that
the love of ones self has blinded: the other is engendered one way by
pondrynge the great offenses / an other way by consydrynge the ryghtous
judgment of god without r^membrance of his mercy. Both these are so pestilent
and cursed / that many doubt which of them is more to be aborred. For what is
greatter madness or more lamentable than man that is earth and ashes / which
what so he is or may do / is for hit all bound to the goodness of god: to
rebelle against him / of whom he was created / of whom he was redeemed / and of
whom by so many means he is called to the company of everlasting life? Is it
not a point of great unkindness to set naught by him / of whom thou haste
r^ceyued so many benefits? Is it not a point of great madness to will to
rebelle against him that may distroye y^ with a beck? Is it not a great point
of wickedness not to knowledge thy maker / not to honor thy father / not to love
thy savior? Unhappy Lucifer was bold to do this first / which ascriuyng to
him self / yt he freely resceiued of lamighty god / said in his heart: I will
get up above in heaven / I will exalte my seat above ye sterres of god / I will
sit upon the hill of testimony in the sides of the North wind / I will clyme
up above the height of the clouds / I will be like to almighty god. But would
to god yt his unhappy fall might at the leest fray mortal creatures from
following of his ungracious example / if the wicked deed it self can not fear
them. Truly if god spared not proud presumptuous a^gels / but cast them
heedlyng down in to hell / and ordained them straytly bound in cheynes to be
kept till the day of dome / what deserves man a sely worm / which as now
were crept out of the earth / must shortly return to earth again / is proud
presumptuous and testy against god? The more low and vile the condition of man
is / ye more abominable is his presumpcion / desiryng to be egal with god. The
ancient poets feyned / There rose a strife on a time among the goddis / that
constrained Jupiter him self to forsake heaven and f^ee in to Egypt / and there
in an other shap to hyde him: but a far more myscheuous deed / was yt the
gyantes went about / which confederated to gether against Jupiter / did cast
hyls upon hyls / yt they might so co^quere heaven and expelle Jupiter thence. Ye
may well laughe / these tales that ye here be not gospel: but yet ye^ erudite
old time would signify some what under the coueryng of these fables / yt
lo^geth to the expre^syng of mortal folks manners. Salmoneus was heedlyng
thrown down in to hell / because he cou^trefetted thou^der and lyghtnyng of
Jupiter. Admit it be but a fable: but how many sely mortal men have there ben /
yt in deed and seriously would have heavenly honors done to them? Did not god
turn Nabugodonosor / that would have made him self a god / in to a brute beast
/ that from a beast he should return to a humayne shappe. Great Alexander
would be take for Jupiters son / and suffered him self to be worshypped at
his table. Domitius Caesar in all his letters patentes and pistils / and in his
communication would be called both god and lord. Adrian ordained yt Antinous
should be worshipped as a god. Why rehearse I all this / when it was a solemn
thing among the Romans / after their Emperors were deperted this life / to
make them goddis. Some of them a live had godly honors / which offered to
accept is wicked madness / and to usurp is desperate blyndnes. If auctorite of
stories be of no great weight, let us here what ye apostel Paul to ye
Thessalonice^s wrote of Nero / truly some interpretate thus: And ye creature of
sin / says he / were uncovered / ye child of perdicio^ / which is agay^st
and is enha^sed above al yt is called god and that is worshipped / so that he
sits in the temple of god / shewy^ge him self as though he were god. But
perauenture it shall seem no maruayle if some yt worshypped for gods / oxen /
apes / dogs / and things more vile / do^me stones / and wodde / would have
them self taken for gods / as far more excellent than these things to
which the people did godly honors. In the actis of the apostles / Herod
knowing there was but one god / of whose honor no man could be partener /
suffered ye people to cry to him in his sermon: This is the voice of god and
not of a man: Shortly after he was stryke^ by the angel of god that revenged
that injury / he the miserable god dyed of the lowsye yuell: than which no
disease is more foul stynkyng and peynfull. I would to god there were none
among christie^s / that followed the wickedness of Lucifer / I may not say pass
it. What? Look ye that I should open somewhat of secret co^fessions? What need
it, when in some countres in the market place in the churches / at dinner /
souper / in playenge and sportyng we here al about they forswere them self by
the most honorable name of god / this yt I say is a light thing: we here the
name of god denied / ye holy name of Christ with many vile words blamed: the
fore finger bytte^ god thretned / ye tho^me put between the formest and myddell
finger, that is done against god fou^tayne of all glory / that is wont to be
done against an infamous person for riproche and shame. Be there none among
Christiens / if they may be called Christie^s / which for reches yt they must
shortly forgo / or foul bodily pleasure / or for transitory honors / forsake
their owne^prince / and make a wicked co^posicion with the^r foo Satanas? the
form of the oath taken, atones they forswere what so ever co^federacio^ was
made with Christ / and offer to hell part of their body as the first fruit /
to ye prince whereof they vowed holly their soul? These things spyed out we se
punyshed daily by open execution. What thing like did Lucifer? for him the son
of god dyed not, and yet he was not so hardy to blaspheme god: he alonly
desired egal honor. That unhappy cuntre / wherein sometime were.v. mighty cites
/ now is a pestylent and abominable lake / for the sweet waters of Iordane
bearyng ill favored claye / the horrible example whereof shall remain ever in
remembrance to them that come after / had the inhabita^ces utterly given to
riot and lechery / but yet we read not that any of them was so wicked / that he
would blaspheme god / curse and threten him: and yet they were all distroyed by
rain myngled with brimstone. O thing horrible / there be^ found among
Christian people / that dare do / that Lucifer durst not / that Gomorra durst
not: which also to so many abominable deeds join blasphemynge. I se you most
dear brethren tremble at rehersynge of these things / and no marvel: I my
self also rehersyng them quyuer and shake both body and soul. Nevertheless
we purpose not only in this sermon to declare how great a sin dispeire of
forgyuenes is / but also to show how excedy^g great ye mercy of god is /
which to preyse we have this day entreprised: the which also spares such
folks / and gives them space to repent and amend. And perauenture we stand
in our own conceyt / by cause among us the examples of crimes / yt I rehearsed
now / be seldom seen: but what matter makes it / if the tongue sou^deth no
blasphemynge when of many ye holle life speaks no other thing but blasphemyng
against god? The gloutto^s for god worship their bealy, who continually by
right and wrong gape to hepe riches to gether / which by murder, treason,
poisonyng, and encha^ting stalk up to honors / which by tyranny opresse poor
people / which to have al thing to their my^de ke^del all the world to war:
nor perseueryng in these great iuels have no shame nor repentance / but with a
shameless cou^tinance like a common woman / rejoice yea in things most
mischieffull / skornynge and mockyng the good lyuers: do not y^ caytiues by
those deeds say: There is no god / goddis behestis ben false / ye thretnynges
of god be vain / the word of god is a lie / yeldynge the joys of heaven to
them that mourn here / that thyrst and hunger Justice / that be meke / that
suffer persecution / that for justice ben with vile words rebuked? What can be
more abominable than this blasphemyng? And yet if any thing can be worse than
that / which is most worse / dispeyre is worse than the holle stynkynge
multitude of other sins. The wicked man seeing me might do what thing he would
unpunished / he was proud of his prosperity and said in his heart: There is no
god, and there is no knowledge above, god cares not for mortal folks busynes.
And as he is less injurious against a man / yt believes not he is / tha^ he
that believes him to be cruel or false: So like wise they been less wicked
that utterly say there is no god / than they that believe he is unmerciful /
taking away that virtue from him / without which kings be not kings but
tyra^tes. But who so ever casts hope of forgyuenes aside and rolleth him
self down in to the hurlepyt of dispeyre / he does not only believe yt god is
not almighty / supposyng some syn so horrible yt he can not forgive: but also
makes him a liar. He promyseth by the prophet / that he will incontinent clean
forgette all manner sins / as soon as the sinner bewaylethe them. Contrary wise
/ they that follow Cain say: My sin is greatter than that I may deserve
forgyuenesse. What sayste / thou wicked wretch? If god over come with the
greatness of thy sin may not forgive the / thou pluckest from him his power
almyghtye: if he will not do that he may / he is a liar and false / yt will not
perform that he so many times promised by ye prophets mouths. Hit is
infinite / what so ever is in god. But.iij. special things be in him / most
high power / most high wisdom / and most high goodness. And al be it yt power
is wont to be ascribed to ye father as his propre / wisdom to the son,
goodness to ye holy ghost: yet there is none of these things / but it is egally
common to all three persons. His high power he showed / when he created these
marvelous warkes of the world only with a beck / of y^ which there is no
part / but it is full of miracle / ye the very pysmers and spyders cry out /
showing the great power of their maker. Again wha^ he divided the wawes of ye
red see: When he restrained the stream of Iordane / and made the river
passable for a foot man: When while Iosue fought / he made the son and moon
stynte their course: Wha^ with touching he healed lepers: and with a word raised
deed men to life / he showed him self lord of nature. And when he with egall
wisdom co^serueth and governs those things / which he by his power yt can
not be declared has made / he shows him self to be no less wise tha^
almighty. Al be it that his goodness every where shines / as that same creation
of angels and this world was a point of high goodness / wha^ he to high
felicite / that he has of him self / lacks nothy^g yt might be added / yet
he made mankind proprely to thentent / that there in specially he might
express the greatness of his goodness and mercy / for in that be half god would
not alonly be more loving to us / but also more marvelous. They marueyle some
time at a kings power and might / that hate or have envy at him. But gentylnes
and lyberalite is loved / yea of them that have no need / that is to say /
through consyderation of humayne chance: where by it may hap any what ever he
be / to have need. But there is no man / nor has been / nor shall be but yt he
needs the mercy of god. When / as witnesses the old testament / neither the
sterres be clear in ye sight of god / and in his angels he found wickedness.
And Paul cryethe to the Romans: There is no distinction / all have sinned /
and need the glory of god / that every mouth may be stopped / and all the
world be made subject to god. Now let is here how well with him agrees ye
mystical synger / which with a lusty spirit exhorts all good folks / yt
they with a spiritual harp with a sautry of.x. strings / with a new song /
and with great shouttynge / should celebrate the glory of god / saying: Our
lord loves mercy and judgment / all the earth is full of our lords mercy.
Ones only is made mention of judgment / but mercy is twyse rehearsed with this
co^mendacion / that thereof ye earth is full. I might boldly add this / stayeng
me by the auctorite of Job and ye apostle: That not only y^ earth is full of
our lords mercy / but also heaven and hell. What syngeth the xxxv. psalm: O
lord thy mercy is in heaven / and thy troth recheth to the clouds. They in
hell perceived the mercy of our lord / when he brake the gates of darkness and
brought out the prisoners in to the heavenly kingdom. If one would consydre the
warkes of god / which after the mystical discussyng of Moses / he made
perfet in ye first.vi. days / he should greatly maruayle at his power and
ineffable wisdom / yea and cry out in the voice of all the church: Pleni
sunt celi et terra. etc. The heuens and earth be full of thy glory. Nor he ne
could abstain him self / but brast out in the hy^ne of the three children:
Benedicite omnia opera dn^i. etc. Bless ye all the warkes of our lord / preyse
and leap up for joy in him evermore. What so ever is created in ye heuens /
what so ever above the heue^s / what so ever in earth / what so ever under the
earth / what so ever in the water / what so ever i^ the air / shows openly
with voice continual the glory of our lord. But what says the psalm.
Cxliiii? Our lord is piteous and merciful / pacient and much merciful. Our
lord is sweet to all / and his merciful pitees passen all his warkes. Ergo
some thing there is more marvelous / than to have made the heue^s / with so
many bryghte sterres / to have created the earth with so many kinds of beastis
/ of trees / and variablenes of all things / to have created so many co^panyes
of angelycall minds. Who durst be so bold to affirm hit / except the
prophet showed plainly / that the mercyes of our lord pass the glory of all
his other warkes? And yet he shall not dout it to be true / who so ever with a
religious curiosite will consider how much more maruelously he redeemed than
created man. Is it not more wonderful god to be made man / than the angels to
be created of god? Is it not more marvel / that god wrapped in a babis
clothes / should wayle / and cry / in the cratche or rack / tha^ to reign in
ye heue^s / yt he made? Here ye a^gels / as thing of greattest wonder sing
glory to god in the most high heavenly ma^sions. They se the lowlyest humilite
/ and know the most excellent highness. All the counsel of redemynge mankind
/ Christis life / Christis teaching / Christis miracles / affliction,
crucifieng, resurrection / aperyng / ascension / the sendyng of the holy ghost
/ by a few sely poor idiote me^ ennewed the world: this counsel I say / is
it not on every side full of miracles / yea that the very a^gels cun not search
out? Wicked spirits se and understand the reason of the worldis creacion /
but the counsel of the worlds restoryng was hyd from them: and in this point
craft disceyued craft / the craft of mercy begyled the craft of malice. The
creation of ye world was the warke of puissance / ye world so restored was ye
warke of mercy. Thendis of the cross says Abacuc / in his hands / there is
his strength hyd. What is more vile than the cross? What is weaker tha^ the
crucified? Yet under that weakness / excedyng power of divine mercy lay hyd /
that brake / over came / and clean distroyed all the tyranny of the dyuell. The
same prophet when he had ears erudite / when he had eyes very clear by faith
/ he herd the holle frame of ye world on every part show the great might of
god / and he was afraid: he considered his warkes / and was amassed. And yet as
though in all these thyngis ye great might of god was not plain enough / he
added / that should overcome all these warkes: In ye mids of two beastis thou
shall be known. In the meare of the old and new testament / he become man /
opened plainly that most bashefull miracle of his mercy. Undouted hit is yt
the prophet soon after adds: When thou would be angry / thou shalt
remember thy mercy. Of them that do things wonderful / we be wont to say: In
those he overcame al / i^ this he overcame him self. Of god some thing like
may well be said: God is incomparable in all his deeds / and can not be followed
/ In mercy he excedeth him self. Holy scripture extolleth no virtue in god so
much as mercy / which some time calls it great / some time ouermoche, and
sometime augmenteth the plentiful abu^da^ce thereof by nombre of multitude. King
David the prophet in the same place / co^plecteth ye largeness and multitude
of divine mercy: Miserere mei de^^ secu^du^. etc. O god have mercy on me after
thy great mercy / and after ye multitude of thy mercyes do away my wickedness.
Where is great misery / there is need of great mercy. If ye consider how
horrible the sin of David was / ye know the largeness of mercy: If ye cast
how many manner wise he offended in one trespass / ye may se the multitude of
his mercies. An excedyng great offense is never committed alone / a fault
draws a fault / as one lynke does an other in a cheyne. First he joined
together two most deedly sins / ma^slaughter and aduoutry: each of them was
more grievous in the king: whose office is to punyshe other that so offend.
For the more princis do amys unpunished among men / the more they offend
god. He bare a ^worde to punysshe manslaughter / and he him self committed
manslaughter. By him women taken in aduoutri were delivered to be stoned to
death / and he him self compelled to do aduoutry. He also peculierly augmented
the same aduoutry / that when he had flocks of wives and concubyns at home /
yet not for need but for wa^to^nes he coueted an other ma^s wife / yt he would
seem delight rather i^ rauysshyng tha^ in simple fornication. For he offe^dethe
not so much / that need co^strayneth to steal somewhat from the rich man /
as he that has his house plentifully stouffed / and takes his gown from him
/ that has no mo to his back. This cruel offense Nathan ye prophet did object
against him under ye parabol of the rich thief and poor man robbed. Now no
kind of ma^slaughter is more cruel / than that yt is not by chance or sudden
mouy^g of ye mind / but by a dryft before driven / waiting convenient time /
is committed. Urias had nothing deserved / the king knew him right trusty /
and he abused the same trustynes of the man to his distructio^. He would in no
wise e^tre within his own house to lie with his wife / because ye ark of god
was lyenge in the tents / and Ioab capytayne of the war with the people /
slept upon the ground / and all that great worthiness of the man could not turn
the kings mind from the iuell deed. The morrow after he had him to supper /
and made him dronke / seky^g occasion to distroy him / if he through dronke^nes
should hap to speak ought indiscreetly. and yet Urias bey^g dronke would not come
i^ his house to take his pleasure with his wife. An other gyle was added /
whereby the strong and trusty warrior must perisshe. A lettre of murder to
him suspectyng no such thing was delivered: for ye king knew his faythfulnes
so perfect / that he had no dout he would open and read it. In the offense of
manslaughter he made Ioab the captain partner / like as he had Bersabee of
aduoutrye. And Urias perished not alone / but to cover ye gyle / many were
brought in to the same danger: a great nombre of people was set in the open
shot of their enemies / to the end one innocent might be kylde / to give place
to the kings foul bodily pleasure. Therefore in one sin how many are the
offenses? If hit were one only sin / and exceeding great / hit needs great
mercy. Now David seeing his ^yn so many fold and diverse / he calls on the
multitude of mercies. But how largely the mercy of god is opened / ye.xxxv.
psalm declares / saying: O good lord thou shall save men and beastis / like
As thou haste multiplied thy mercy. God saves not only man / but also he
vouchesafeth for man's beho^e to save bestis. Again i^ an other place how
reioyseth the prophettes spirit / when he says: I will sing the mercies of
god perpetually. And therefore in the heuens ye mercy of god is worshipped and
honored / like as says an other psalm: Knowledge your self to god because he
is good / because his mercy is in all worlds. The preising of ye mercy of god
seemed to have end / after the end of all wretchedness came / except the same
felicite yt good folks have in heaven / were the gift of mercy / and the
punishment of the wicked tempered with the great mercy of god. But what shall
we say / when all the life with a thousand syns / and all the stynkyng see of
vices is corrupted? Truly we must cry with Asaph: O lord remember not our old
iniquitees / but let thy mercy prevent us quickly / for we be made over poor.
Again in an other place: Many be thy mercyes lord / after thy pleasant speech
quicken me. Again in an other place David / as he co^playned with god / cries
out: Where be thy old mercyes good lord? Again in the psalm.Cvj. Let the
mercies of our lord be confessed / and his maruayles of the sons of men:
Which verse as enterlyned is often repeted i^ ye same psalm. In ye psalm also
that goes next before: And he gave us unto his mercies in the sight of all
that took them. He said mercies / because he had rehearsed many wicked deeds /
with which he provoked the anger of god. And David on all partis oppressed
with yls / says: It is better that I fall in the hands of our lord: for
manifold are his merices / than in to the hands of men. As in one offense
often times are many sins, so like wise in one m^rcy many mercies are
contained. Ones he redeemed mankind / but here in how manifold are the
mercies? Which Esaias beholdynge with the eye of faith / speaks thus in the
person of god / promising our savior Jesus: And I will make with you a
covenant everlasting / the faithful mercies of David. In a like figure god
being appeased speaks in the prophet Hieromie: And I will give you mercies /
and shall have pite upon you. For many grievous sins, many mercyes are
promised. Like wise after many afflictions / god having pity of his people
speaks thus in the prophet zacarie: I will return to Jerusalem in mercies /
and my house shall be builded. But why rehearse we those things / out of books
of the old testament / in which so often times the name of mercies is
encou^tred? And yet some heretykes believe that ye same law proceeds of a
^uste and not of a good god / when it souneth welnere nothing else than the
mercies of our lord. How much less is it to be maruailed / if Paul
thapostle in the.ii. pistle to the Thessal. according to the prophettis words
writes in this wise: Blessed be god and father of our lord Jesus Christ /
father of mercyes / and lord of al co^solacio^ / which comforts us in all
our tribulacion. The apostle somewhat adds to mercy, for it is a point of
mercy to perdone offense done: here which is much more / god of a reue^ger is
made a co^forter. These things we have repeted of the holy scripture / to
thentent that we by that figure of spekyng might understand the signified
excedyng and unspeakable mercy of god toward every body / and in all yls. The
same is showed by an other figure / which is either Anadiplosis, that in latin
one may call Co^duplicatio, orels nerest to Anadiplosis. For as the Hebrews
call that good good / that they reken to be excedyng good / and ill ill yt is
excedyng ill: so likewise in holy scripture god is often called pitefull and
merciful / for the excedyng greatness of his mercy. So ye read in the psalm
Cxliiij. Our lord is pitefull and merciful / and as though that also were a
small thing / he adds: Pacient and much merciful. Again in an other
psalm: Our pitefull and merciful lord has made remembrance of his
marueiles. Likewise in Iohel, Rent your hearts and not your clothes / for our
lord god is pitefull and merciful, and sorowynge for malices. And in the
prophet Jeremy: Therefore my bowelles have been troubled upon him / I piteynge
shall have mercy on them / says our lord. What is piteyng to have mercy / but
to have mercy out of mea^ure? To this point perteyneth / that sithe it is
infinite / what so ever is in god: yet it that among men sowneth unto vice /
holy writ seems to ascribe unto him / certain over much and vnmoderate
mercy. I would your goodness should so take this saying / as persuaded
nothing to be in god that sowueth to any vice / should understand / that under
y^ figure the holy scripture submyt^yng it self to man's perceyuyng /
signyfyeth a marvelous and an i^credible excess of divine mercy. Which
thing yt I may more plainly speak and ye more perfectly perceive / co^sydre
this in your mind. If a king should stablyshe rigorous laws on a mankyller /
and after he had co^mytt^d ma^slaughter ones would perdone him / may hap it
should be ascriued to his cl^mency. But and he perdoned him yt had done yt
mischeuous deed.x. times or more / would not every body cry out: The kings
cleme^cy is o^uer much, y^ overthrows ye strength of ye laws, and provoke
ye lewd persons to do wickedly for lack of punisheme^t? Also a father that
ones or twice for gives his son for spendyng his money lewdly away, may hap
shall be called ea^y and mylde. If ye same father often times give his son
money / so lewdly wastyng hit / will not every body say: He is to easy / and
by his hyndnes marreth his son? And much more southly hit might be said / if
he did so to his servant. More over / if an husband should take in worth / if
his wife were taken ones in auoutry, undoubted every body would marueyle to
find so meke an husband. But and ye woman soon after break her wedlock, and
is taken i^ auoutry now with one now with an other / if he tha^ took her to
him again / would not all the people say he were a stark fool, orels his
wives baude? But god yt is our king / our father / our lord, our spouse,
exc^pteth no kind of syn, he prescribet^ no no^bre of synnyng, as often as we
amend he releaseth our peine: which his everlasting law thretneth / he
receives us in to his household / he leads us i^ to the chamber of his
charity / and he not only receives us but also forgyueth all our offenses.
The sheep that was lost he carries home on his shulders to ye cote again: he
stereth the congregation of holy folk to rejoice to gether / he mereth the
riottous child returnyng home from far country / he offers him a fair gown
and a ring / he commands to kylle a goodly calfe. What thing else signifies
all this / but vnmoderate / and ^if I may so say) ouermoche mercy of god. But
now it seems less marvel / if a m^n forgive a man offe^dyng / that also
other while does offense him self likewise / or may offend, if a king perdone
him / yt sometime did him good profitable service: or if the father forgive his
son / whose co^uersacio^ he feleth does ease his old age: if a master forgive
is servant / by whose labor he partly lives: if the husband forgive his wife
taken in auoutrie / with whom other while he leads his life pleasantly.
Among men he that some time perdoneth dredeth him that he forgiueth / and
other while can not aue^ge him self / if he would. But god that has need of
no man / that may with a beck distroy us if he would / so often times of us
despised / forsaken / and denied: suffers / calls / receives / and
enbraseth us. As no love is more fervent nor strayter conioynynge / than
between man and wife: so like wise no anger is harder to appease than it yt
ryseth by breakyng of wedlock. And yet here what our mylde lord says by the
prophet Esaias to his spouse an auou^rice / defiled with so many auoutries: It
is commonly said / if a man forsake his wife / and she departed from him
weddeth an other man / shall he return to her any more? Shall not ye woman be
poluted and defiled? Truly thou co^mittest fornication with many lovers / and
yet return to me (says our lord) and I will receive the. A married man will not
take his wife again / whom parauenture he forsook for a small fault or cause /
if she after ye deuorce be wedded to an other man. For wedlockis love can not
suff^e ye company of an other man. But yet god does not disdain his spouse /
for whom he suffered death / which for him self he purified with his blood /
y^ so often wylfully runs away / and abandoneth her self to so many unclean
wyghtis / if she will return again. And it is no marvel / if he have
ouermoche mercy / yt has ouermoche charity toward us. Paul bassheth not to
write thus to the Ephesiens: We were by nature the children of anger / like as
the other were / but god that is rich in mercy / for his ouermoche charity /
that he loved us with / and wha^ we were deed i^ syns, he quickened us all to
gether in Christ. Johan in his gospel expresses more plainly ye ouermoche
charity of ye father toward us. God / says he / loved so the world / yt he
would give his only begotten son, that who so ever believes in him shall not
perish / but have euerlasty^g life / with whom Paul agrees tunably / writy^g
to y^ Romans: which also spared not his own son / but delivered him for us
all: how / gave he not us all things with him? If this great ^harite / this
so great mercy / should be conferred to all humayn charity and mercy / and to
our merits / would hit not well seem vnmoderate? But ^rewly it shall appear
much more veritable / if we consider what he is / that so loves us / and so
shows his mercy on us / and what we be / that god vouchesafeth so great
honor. Let each look on him self / after the name in baptism given / after
Satanas forsaken with his pompis / how often he forsakes the sacrament and
yeldeth him to thennemy of his spouse, how often after absolucio^ of his synnis
received of ye pressed he slydeth into more grievous offenses / ye how often ye same
day he falls in to them / that he aborred? Let no body most dear brethren
dissemble with him self / who so ever steals or commits auoutry / who so
ever e^uieth or sklandreth his brother / who so ever coueteth wordly honors /
leaves his spouse Christ / turns away from his father, forsakes his king,
and flees away far from his lord. But perauenture we shall have a littell
after a more convenient place to speak of these things. Now to the end ye may
more fully understand / how largely the exceeding mercy of god spredeth, ye
must understand / yt in holy writ the cleapyng of mercy signifies sometime
liberalyte / sometime grace preue^tyng / sometime aua^synge / other while
co^fortyng / again other where healyng, but very often forgyuyng / orels also
punyshynge. For surely after my mind / that ye our lord spek^th in Luke. Be
merciful like as your father is merciful / perteyneth specially to
liberalite. For perfect liberalite is / if one do good to his e^nemes.
Mattheus says hit more plainly in a like saying of our lord: Be ye (says he)
perfect / like as your father celestial is perfect / that makes his son to
shine on good and ill / and sends rain to just and unjust. But because we
have nothing / that we ne received freely of god / what ever we may or be /
what so ever we possess / it is the mercy of god. Yea that he created angels /
and this world / is the mercy of god. If he had created hit for him self /
the power or wisdom might be preysed. Now / seeing he has wroughte all
these things for us / know not we the excedyng great mercy of god? For whom
mouen ye celestial bodies above? For whom shyneth the son by day / The
moon and the sterres by night / but for man? For whose profit were all these
things wrought / wha^ they were nothing? For whom make the hangyng clouds
shadow / and moist the feldes? For whom blows the wind? For whom run the
ryuers / the wells spring / the sea ebb and flow / the pondis stand
stylle? For whom engenders the ple^tifull earth so many beastis / and brings
forth so much riches / but for man? For he subdued every thing unto man / he
would man should only be subject to him: like as witnesses Paul writing to
the Corinthies. All things be yours / but ye be of Christ / and Christ is of
god. And it that Moises shows in Genesis the.viij. psalm repeteth /
marueylyng at ye goodness of god / that of his mercy has given to man so many
ben^fites. What is man says he / that thou remembrest him / or the son of
man / that thou visetest him? Thou haste made him little l^sse tha^ angels /
thou have crowned him with glory and honor / and have set him above ye warkes
of thy hands. Thou haste subdued all under his feet / sheep and oxen
euerichone / yea and more beasts of the field / birds of the air / and
fyshes of the sea. I will say yet that is higher: We be bound to the mercy of
god for the heavenly angels. Believe not my word / without Paul teach it
plainly / writing to the Hebrews / and speking of angels. Be not says he /
all spirits servants in service sent for their sake / that receive the
inheritance of salvation? And both in ye old and new testament we often read
yt by ministracion of angels ye hu^gry were refreshed / prisoners d^liuered /
cou^tres ouerro^ne / ye good folk comforted with joyful tidings. More over
our lord him self in the gospel says: Their angels behold always the face of
ye father, that is in heaven. What is more marvelous than this worthynes /
angels given to sely men as governors to children? Therefore what so ever thou
have man / truly thou have all things while thou remaynest in Christ / thou
should reken to have it al of his mercy. Otherwise Paul will stamp and cry
out upon the: What have man that thou have not received? And if thou haste
received it / why magnifiest thy self / as you dyddest not receive hit? Farther
/ what yuell so ever thou see in other / aknowlege the mercy of god
preue^tyng y^: Whereof David not in one place says: And his mercy shall prevent
me. Thou art no bastard borne / nor lame / nor blind / thou art not poor /
nor dulwitted / like as many be borne / give thanks to ye mercy of god
preue^tynge the. What so ever hurtes happen to an other man might have chanced
to the / nere that ye mercy of god had defended the. Again / thou art none
aduoutrer / no false forswere^ / no mankyller / no church robber / like as
(alas) over many be, aknowlege the mercy of god, for thou should have been /
and the mercy of god had not kept the.

A man on a time yt could good skele in phisnomy iuged Socrates to his
disciples / to be a man desirous of riot / and ouermoche given to lechery /
they knowing their masters incredible te^pera^ce / pertly laughed him to
scorn, and partly disdained him. Socrates blamed them and praised him /
saying. He has diuined truly / all this had I ben / if phylosophie had not
taught me te^pera^ce. But much more southly y^ right holy man Francis
as^riueth unto divine mercy / that Socrates yeldeth to philosophy. For on a
time wha^ his fellow / of him commanded so to do / had reviled him with what so
ever words a mischeuous caytiue is wont to be rebuked / calling him church
robber / mankyller / backebiter / poller / and poysoner, he took it most
patiently / and bewailed him self yt he was such one.

An other time when his fellow asked him why he ^o^pelled him to make so many
lies upon an inno^e^t for none of al these things were i^ him he answered:
Thou do not lie, for all these had I ben / yea and much more / nere yt ye
mercy of god kept his servant from those sins. And ye mercy of god does not
only prevent and provoke us to goodness / but also helps us entprisynge /
acco^panieth us going forth, and in conclusion gives us puissance, yt we may
perform that man's strengthes could not do. Me seems the apostle Paul
signifies such a manner of mercy in many places / but specially in gretynges /
besechyng grace and peace. In pistils to Timotheus also he adds mercy. And
certes without prejudice of a better sentence / if any have it to show / I
think grace perteyneth to calling of us / for we be called by faith / yt is
believe. This faith is the free gift of god / and therefore they to whom it
happeth, are for it bond to the divine mercy. Mercy perteyneth to diverse
gifts distributed to each after the measure of his faith. Peace longs to
the innocency of all the life / with out which / friendship with god can not he
had / nor true co^corde with our brethren. Ueryly as often as we be delivered
from iuels that we be grieved with / we should not repute it to the sterres / to
Fortune / nor to our prudence / but we ought to ascriue it al to ye mercy of
god. No man tangled in the bo^des o^ syn can be delivered / except he be help
by divine mercy. This teaches the psalm. Cxxix. For our lord has great
mercy / and in him is plentyfull redemption and he will redeem Israel from all
iniquities thero^. Farther / that the mercy of god delyuereth us also from
bodily harms / Paul declares writing to the Philippe^ses: Epaphroditus was
sick yea nere deed: but god says he / pitied hy^ / and not only him / but
also me / lest I should have had sorrow upon sorrow. Nor there is no difference
bitwene mercy helpyneg and co^fortyng / save that we be help / wha^ ye yuels
be taken away yt grieved us / but mercy co^forting is at hand / as often as in ye
mids of afflictions i^ tempereth the grefe of aduersite with mynglyng of
ioy^ull things / causing fruit with temptation / as Paul says / whereby we
may sustain hit. And the same yuels often times are sent of god pit^ynge /
whereby we may ^ither purge our ill deeds committed / orels withdraw us that we
commytte no mo / or to mynistre us matter to exercise virtue. In such wise
Abraham was tempted / so Job was exercised in diverse troubles / so who so ever
lived well in Jesus Christ / werein this world proved by diverse a^flictio^s /
as gold is by the fire. Where be they that murmr against god, as often as to
them happeth bodily sickness / or death of their children or wife / or as often
as they have loss of househol^e stouffe / or as often as their field fruits
fail / not understanding these to be the most certain tokens of god piteyng
us? Let us rather here what Solomon monisheth us: My son / cast not away
the teaching of our lord / nor leave him not / when he corrects the: For
him yt our lord loves he corrects: and deliteth in him as a father in his
child. Paul to the Hebrews repeteth this sentence / changyng somewhat the
words. For whom our lord loves he chastises: he scourges forsothe every
child that he admytteth. Therefore most well-beloved brethern^ as often as ye
storm of aduersite assaileth you continue in discipline / as Paul cou^saileth
/ knoweyng yt god offreth him unto you as unto children / here the voice of the
father mercifully correctyng his children in ye psalm. lxxxviij. If they
violate my iusticis / and keep not my co^mandementes / I will visete their
iniquites by the rod / and their sins by beatynges. But I will not throw my
mercy from him / nor I will not hurt in my troth. And like wise Paul thretneth
the children that he loves / saying: What would ye / shall I come to you by the
rod / or in the spirit of hyndnes and mekenes? But the same Paul says:
What needs me to judge of them yt be without? No voice is more bitter and
sharp unto children / than to here their father say: Do what ye will / I care
not. For thus says he that myndeth to disherite. Surely this fatherly hyndnes
is sharper than any chiding. Therefore as sufferance is cruel / so correction
is merciful. The just man says: He shall correct me in his mercy / and shall
rebuke me / but the oil of the sinner shall not greece my heed. Paulus Emilius
the Romayn capitayn which being prosperous in all his deeds, diuined yt some
great iuel was coming. And Polycrates ye tyra^ of Samiens went always about to
redeem ye envy of fortune, flateryng with loss of a ring most precious. How
much more ought we dread living wickedly / lest the just vengeance of god
hang over us / when the prosperity of temporal goods flater us long. For
when god in the prophecies will express his vnpeasable anger / he thretneth to
take away his rod from them / and that by afflictions he will not redress
their sins. God keep us most dear brethren from such felicite. But rather,
if ye mercy of our father vouchesafe us ought of wealth / we must thank him,
and be careful lest we any where should abuse his liberalite. And if aduersite
grieve us / we should no less thankyng him submit us holly to his arbitreme^t.
To have health of body, thou submittest the to the phisician a man, thou
suffer ye surgian to bind / cut / and burn / will not submyt the to thy
maker / lord / father / and savior / that thou may have thy soul health
everlasting? Thou dare not lymyt to the leche / thus and by this reason heal
me: and shall we condition with god / how he should provide for our souls
health? Paul thapostle suff^ed thangel of the devil to assail him and give
him blows / for so it was expedient to reteyne the gifts that he had
received. When I am weak says he / than am I strong. And he glorifieth
gladly in his infirmites / that he might possess the virtue of Christ
dwelling in him. What be we / that refuse this mercy of god / by diverse
afflictions / as hit were with bitter playsters / procuring our health?

The common people wha^ they se one yt is descended of high lineage / having
abu^da^ce of riches, health of body / and heaped in honors / are wont to say:
How much is he bound to god? Thus judge they / that esteem felicite in those
thing is, yt ^e seen outward. But he that examyneth the thing after the
judgment of god / shall find of^e^ times the low birth / poor / sickely /
and ye out cast among men more bound to ye mercy of god than these ioly
fellows / that the gross multitude makes egall to goddis. Heap to gether as
much of vnwelthynes as thou wylt / touching ye world / yet if you by these
te^porel yuels redeem felicite everlasting / you art abu^da^tly happy. Now
forgyuyng mercy / which also we cleape Clemency / every man knows / save he
that thinks him self gyltles from all syn. But what says thapostle John^?
If we say we be without sin / we be liars / and there is no treuth in us. And
if ye sterres be not clear in ye syghte of god / and if in his angels he found
wickedness / if no creature be pure in the sight of god / yea not a child of a
day old / which of us may glorify to have a chaste heart?

Many seem rightous among men / before god no man is just: but al our
iusticis are as it were the clothe of a woman defiled with ye menstruous flixe.
Paul perceyueth how the carnal law in his me^bres stryueth against the law
of the mind / and cries out: I unhappy creature / who shall deliver me from
the body of this death: Job with a just man's title honored / is not found
clean fautles by the talking of god. Also he the prophet David dredeth the
judgment of god / nere that it were alayed with much mercy. Thou should not
e^tre good lord says he / in judgment with thy servant for truly no living
creature shall be found just in thy sight. Now let each of us enter in to the
chamber of his conscience / and consider how many ways / how often / how
grievously he has offended god / yea with what sundry vices al our benefittes
are defiled: and so than he shall understand how much he is bound to the
exceeding great mercy of god: that so patiently suffers our feble^es / that
by so many occasions stereth us to repentance / that so swetely forgyueth all
our offenses / when we leave our wickedness. To al these I will add, that shall
seem to some not very prouable.

When god distroyeth ye wicked lyuers / yt ro^ne to the hiest point of malice /
and casts them down in to hell / yet than he forgets not his mercy.

He delyuereth ye Hebrews / diuidynge ye wawes of the sea / and drowneth
Pharao with his guard. Mercy was on both sides / helpyng toward his people /
punyshyng toward the king full of desperate malice / lest he should / heapyng
sins upon sins / purchase him self more grievous peynes in hell. The
healyng mercy was / that god by so many plages stered him to do penance. And
now he, assailed with so many yuels / began to repent: but after he repented
him self again of his helthfull repentance / and said: I know not our lord
/ nor I will not let ye people go. Nor yet he moved with so great miracle
ceased not to pursue them: but blinded with anger / boldly entered in to ye see
/ God of his mercy oppressed his desperate malice / that when he would not be
healed / he should more easily perish. The ^ame ought to be demed of the other
examples of cruelte / that be rehearsed in books of the old testament / as of
them that the fire burned, the ground swalowed, ye sword distroyed / the
serpents devoured. For in the gospels the examples of vengeance are fewer /
but all of mercy. Hit was an easy correction / that Elymas stryken with sudden
bly^dnes / was taught not to strive against ye word of the gospel. Paul
delivered a few to Satanas in affliction of the flesh / that ye soul might
be saved at ye day of dome: and they corrected with shame, should turn to
better fruit. There is no example more rigorous than of Ananias and Saphiras /
that by Peter's correction fell down deed suddenly / and yet it is uncertain
whether their souls by death of the body are saved. Finally the punishment
that the damned souls of ill lyuers suffer in hell / is less tha^ their
meritis. And there be some / yt esteem the mercy of god so great / yt they
believe that ye wicked spirits also and damned soulis / ones after many seasons
gone about, shall be received to grace. Though this opinion stays on a great
author / yet it has be^ reproved by ye perfect fathers of our faith: which
only we rehearse for this intent / that we may declare / what an excedy^g
great opinion me^ most highly learned conceived of the mercy of god: which
night and day were occupied in holy books / which sing / extolle / and
magnify welnere nothing else but the mercy of god. Now if it be showed
sufficiently / what ever we be or have touchy^g goodnes^ that we be defended
from iuels depe^dyng / that we be delivered from hurtes oppressyng, that in the
mids of tribulacions / refreshed with heavenly comfort, we abide strong and
lusty, that by temporal afflictions we be either instructed to repentance / or
exercised to perfect virtue / that our syns done be not to us imputed /
whereinto so often we slide / comes al of the mercy of god: that ye may more
clearly perceive the excedyng heyght / bread / and depenes thereof / I pray you
that with me ye will a little behold your self inwardly / first in yt party
through which ye be most loathsome / and after in that whereby ye excelle /
lastely ye must regard the yls that outward hang over and compass you
about / and again to y^e bounties, of whom the hope is to you showed. The
contemplacion of all these things will teache us the largenes of divine mercy /
where of verily is neither measure nor nombre.

If we behold this small body the pype or litel house of our soul / uneath one
may find any beast more weaker / lothsom, ye or more wretched. If ye enquere
ye beginning / the first of our kind was of claye. Now let every man consider
this / how litell or nothing is the great po^posenes / what ever is of the
humor / of whose co^ielacio^ the principles of mankind take beginning / when
as yet it is hyd in the woman's womb. Than how far that humor dista^teth from
hipocras and deyntie meats / wherewith the child not borne is norished. I will
not rehearse here ye filthiness of ma^ky^dis birth only that ye have often seen,
call to mind. What is more wretched tha^ ma^kyndis birth? How long and how
perilous be ye panges of women trauaylyng? What miserable wailynges? At last
ye child hit self crepyng forth soon from weeping and waylyng begins the
life. And where as Nature to all other beastis as soon as they come forth /
gives diverse as coueringis or defenses / shells / barks / thick skyns /
pricks / hears / bristils / quils / feathers, scales, flissis, and also other
while defends the stu^pes and trees from cold and hete with a double bark:
only mankind naked, and on ye bare ground the day of his birth she casts
out / forth with to weep and wayle, who would not judge in this point ye a chekyn
crept out of the broken shell more happy tha^ ma^kinde? Farther / se how he is
swadled / his mouth totheles, his touge specheles, his eyes can not suffer ye
new light / and fares as it would enter the darkness of the mothers womb
again / that he left, ye moulde quauereth long / a toke^ among al beastis
of greattest weakness, brefely all the litel body is weak / in which is no
membre yt does his dewty. Most part of all other beastis as soon as they be
brought forth, emplie ye gifts of their nature. Some are swyft, as horses. As
soon as ye buterflie comes out of the skyn it flees: It is no sure wrestling
with a leons whelpe. As soon as fyshes be spaumed they swymme: Tadpolles
rollen them self with great swyftnes before they may be called or have any
shap of frogs: only what other thing can mankind do by course of nature
but weep? How long lerneth he to go? When he has learned to go on.11. feet /
how long must he learn to speak? ye he can not feed / outcept he be taught.
Add now y^ many kinds of sickenessis / that uneath can be rehearsed / and
specially ye new / that it is hard to heal them / how be it among the old
many be incurable. Some take ma^kinde soon after the birth / some also in the
birth / as lepre / fally^g yuel / whereby many dye or they begin to live. And
this while I speak nothing of them that be borne with many defautis of nature
and mysshapen. Now let each consider this by him self / what do^mages he has
suffered i^ youth / how fugitive youth is / how careful man's state / how
wretched / old age: and so forth how short ye holle life / though one hap to
be old / which yet chances to very few. Who so ever of you is at man's
state / let him reke^ the course of the life past / and count fro what
sickenessis / from what great perils he is escaped / and let him thank ye
mercy of god. Uerily I would reken among bodily yuels as principal / the seeds
of all manner vicis fast routed in us / how greatly to a^ger / to bodily
pleasure / to riot / to e^uy / to a^bicion / to covetousness / to robbery / from
our mothers womb we be inclined: where all other beastis lyuen lowably wi^h in
the desires of nature^ What a labor is it to us all to wrast^ll with these
leauynges of old Ada^? to how few lucky? The soul is over loded with the
weight of yt erthy body: and whether it will or will not / is drowned in these
things that it aloweth not. Farther more co^sydre / what rout of yuels ^nui^on
us without / and ye shall find yt many mo perish by chance tha^ sickness. How
many be distroyed by lyghtnyng / earth quakes / ground openynges / lakes /
floddes of ye see and ryuers / infectous aer / venom / wyld beastis / falling
of huge things, ill phisicio^s: but no way greatter destruction than through
wars?

But all these myscheues thretten to distroye but the body. How many dangers
hang over ye soul? fro ye flesh a household e^nemy / fro the world now
flattryng that it may strangle / now ragyng that it may oppress / fro wicked
spirits yt other while transfigure them self like angels of light. Who
dredeth not of these ye multitude / powers / disceit / malice / and insatiable
desire to distroye? Now who among these yuels would it not nere slay / death
certain to each / the day uncertain / the rigorousnes of thextreme dome / the
peynes of hell everlasting? I se you tremble at thonly reme^brynge of these so
great myscheues / and no wrong: but the more ye here of yuels and dangers /
the more ye be bound to the mercy of god / which among al these yls not
only defe^deth those that trust thereon / but also turns all these things to
us in occasion of more felicite. What so ever calamite we have here we may wit
it the syn of old Adam: but for the felicite instead of calamite to us yelden
more ple^tifully / we ought to thank the new Adam / that is Christ Jesus of
all creatures preysed ye world without end. Satanas expelled us out of
Paradyse / Christ for therthly paradise opened us the heavenly kingdom. The
serpent drove us to diverse sorrows of this life / Christ restored us to joys
everlasting of life i^mortall. Satanas by his gyle got us bodily death / Christ
by his mercy rewarded us life etnal / to whom who so ever with a pure heart
yeldeth him / needs to dread no kind of e^nemies. He overcame the world / he
vanquished all Satanas tyranny / he turned ye flesh in to spirit. That he
overcame is of his power: yt he over came for us / is of his mercy. Let us
honor his merciful might / and take fruicion of his myghtyfull mercy. All
things we may do by him / that makes us mighty / if we abide with him: al
things we possess by hy^ / i^ whom is al goodness every where us defendyng /
aydyng / co^fortyng / and encresyng by his mercy / like as the prophet says in
ye psalm: Mercy will enuiron them that trust in our lord. To what great ils
are they subject / that put their trust in bodily gifts / in riches / in
chares / in horses / in worldly prudence / in their merits and deeds? But by
what succors is ye just man out of care? Truly says he / I trust in ye
multitude of thy mercy. And a little after: Lord as with the bucler of thy
good will have crowned us. When ye here / Of thy good will / ye understand ye
hope of your own merits to be excluded. Where the stre^thes of nature fail
us / where our merits forsake us: there mercy succoureth us. The warriors
shyldes cou^r but one part of the body / the buccler of divine mercy does
fensiuely cover us all about / above against the fyrie darts of wicked
spirits / that hang over us from the celestiens: beneth against the sl^ight
of the serpent yt wayteth to attrap us: before / lest things present grieve us:
behind / lest things past e^uade us again: on the right hand lest
prosperity make us insolent: on the lift hand lest aduersite over throw us.
Trusty^g in this bucler David cries out: Our lord is my helper / I will not
dread what a man can do to me. And in another place: I will not fear a
thousand people co^passyng me about. But Paul thapostle cries out yet more
boldly writing to the Romans: If god be with us says he / w^o shall be against
us?

That noble warrior armed him with all ye harneis of the faith / which
fortifieth us not by hope of our warkes / but of divine mercy. He bey^g bold on
this armor, did not only despise grefe / hunger, pouerte / peril /
persecution: but also the tyra^s sword / thretning to sle him by and by. The
humayn cruelnes may do nothing / where the mercy of god is ready at hand to
defend: yea this is stronger / he despised beside death and life / a^gels /
principalites / virtues / things present and to come, fortitude, altitude /
depthe / and so forth / if any other creature were in the heue^s / or in earth /
or in hell^. And this is he, which knowing his weakness calls hy^ self an
erthe^ pot. We have says he / this treasure i^ erthe^ pottes. Fro whens tha^
has this britell erthe^ pot so much strength? By the grace of god says he, I
am it that I am. What is the grace of god but ye mercy of god? Let us gladly
glorify with Paul in our infirmites / that the virtue of Christ may dwell in
us: for so it is more expedient for us / that by conte^placion of our miseries
/ we may glorify the mercies of god. And yet the mean while / if it like the
/ behold thy self thou man / in that part that thou excellest the other
beastis. For if thou esteem thy self after the goodness of the body, thou see
thou art lower than many brute beastis / the camels in greatness excede the, in
swyftnes the tigers / in strength the bulls / in color the swannes, in
apparayle pecockes / in helthines the fyshes / ye if we believe the proverb /
welnere all beasts / in quick sight ye beast lynx and egles / in smellyng
gripis, in long life hartis and crows. And yet if one co^sydre ye gifts of
the humayn body / he shall here fy^de wherein he may preyse ye mercy of god. What
sagasite of the.v. wittis / what great co^formite of me^bres / how feet
instruments to diverse uses? But of those things also Lactantius a man of
singular eloquence / co^piled a book / which he names De opificio dei. To
read that book will profit us much, if we mind what goodness is in the body,
and as hit all comes from the mercy of god / to be servant like bond to
divine obeisance. Other wise he that will glorify in bodily gifts / shall by
and by here: All flesh is hey / and all glory thereof is as the flower of
hey. Why art proud thou do and ashes? Neither in gifts of the soul / in
which part man is more marvelous / he has ought / that he may challenge as
his own. He that made the body / formed ye soul / ye body he made of slyme
and put in the soul with inspiryng of his mouth. And therefore of the other
beasts the soul and body perish to gether / ours is alive after the body /
^yl she receive it again in the resurrection promised. Now how effectual a
thing the soul is / ye very death declares, which as soon as she deperteth,
there lies the carkes unprofitable: where is the hete / where is the color /
where is the mouyng / where is the might of all the wits? And yet while the
soul is holden fast tied to this so unhappy sely body / doing nothing but
through the bodily instruments / which very often let / yt she can not put
forth her native power / how marvelous is ye swiftnes and profounde
understanding of man's mind. What an exceeding treasure of remembrance. What is
so hyd in ye secrets of nature / or i^ ye heue^s / or in earth / that man's wit
can not mark / perceive / and discuss? It is a great thing / that many by
situacion and mouynge of the sterres show what shall fall many years to come:
but it is more that by ye things wrought / the euerlasty^g power and godheed
of the same worker is found out / wytnes is Paul: How much is the swiftnes
of ma^s wit / i^ how short space / how many things does ma^s wit behold at
ones? But how ^xcedeth y^ might of memory, that truly observes ye shaps of so
many things / and so many names of things committed to her by ye ministracion
of the wits? I will speak nothing here of them / yt have learned so many
sciences so hard to know / and so many la^gages and that that they learned /
they reteyne still. Let him that will of you think / how many folks faces and
names he reme^breth / how many shaps of beastis / trees / herbs / places /
and of other i^numerable things he knows / and memorially cleapeth them by
name. The common people call these gifts of nature / wha^ i^ deed they be
gifts of divine mercy / which are departed to each not after our merits /
but after his benignite. Al these things because ye prodigal child abused to
ye pleasure of humayn will / not only it is not withdrawe^ that was given / but
by grace more abundantly beralite of gifts is added. By law he instructed us
/ by his son^e whom holle he gave to us / he taught us the secrets of god / by
his spirit he enriched our souls with diverse gifts / passing man's power.
He gives understanding of mystical scriptures / that give light and comfort
to us in all yls, he gives forknowlege of things to come / he gives tongues
to speak sundry langages / to co^tempne venom / to heal sycknesses / to reyse
the deed / to confo^de noyful spirits / he gives power to ouerco^e hell gates
/ he grau^teth us to be me^bres of Christ / children of god, perteners of the
kingdom celestial / that never shall have end. Here co^t to me whereof thou
were made / without dout on the one part claye, tha^ how much under ye
co^diction of beastis syn threw the. Again / to what dignite / to what
felicite thou art called / and tha^ thou shall clearly se / ye mercies of our
lord have neither nu^bre nor measure. What is more despised tha^ scarbetes?
Yet is a scarbet pure i^ comparison to ye filthiness of a sy^ner. What is higher
than angels? Were hit not out of al measure to make an angel of a scarbet?
Now man more abject than a scarbet / he made greatter tha^ angel / I may
boldly say / he made him a god. For why should not I dare boldly say it yt the
scripture does: I said ye be goddis / and excellent children? What so ever
comes of god is made in a manner god. What so ever is joined to the body and
spirit of Christ / comes in to the fellowship and perttakyng of his name.
Here if nothing be that thou to thy merits may ascribe / glorify the mercy
of god / worship the mercy of god / enbrace and kiss the mercy of god. If that
any go about to claim any part of this to him self / Paul thapostle will by
and by cry out against him / yelding all these things to the grace of god.
All his pistils sou^de out ye word of grace: which as often as thou hereste
understand ye mercy of god to ye commended. Of grace it is / that we be purged
from sin / through grace we believe / of grace it is that by his spirit
charity is spredde in our hearts / whereby we do good warkes. For we be not
sufficient by our self / as of our self: but al our ablenes comes from god.
If Paul said truth / where be those shameless fellows / yt selle to every
body their good warkes / as though they had so much at home / that they might
enryche other? They be miserable / that so selle their good deeds / cursed they
be that trust in men's warkes. Who that is grieved with the first disease / let
him here what the church Laodice^s hereth in ye Apocalypse. Thou say: I am
rich and ple^tifull and need nothing / and know not that thou art a wretch
/ miserable / pour / blind / and naked. But they also syn more grievously /
that of thabunda^ce of their good warkes promise other riches. But what
cou^saileth the holy ghost such folk? I counsel the says he / to bye fiery
gold of me proved / that thou may be rich in deed. And thou that know
thyn own pouerte / why beggest of beggars? S. James says: If any want wisdom
/ let him ask it of god, that gives to each abundantly / and abraydeth none
thereof. Every good gift / and every perfect gift descends from above from ye
father of lyghtes. And ask thou of a man ye garment of good warkes / which
is ye more piteously naked / the more gayely he rekeneth him self clothed?
Aknowlege thy misery / and ye mercy of god is ready. Among me^ / which abrayd
one a other of a good turn / which for one pleasure look to have many / is
nohtynge derer bought / than it that is bought with prayers: with god nothing
is so fr^ as that yt is bought with.ij. litel pieces of money / prayer and hope,
for he that will sell his mercy, has given us ye same price to pay for it. we
have spoken many things well-beloved brethren of ye mercy of god / but there is
much more to say / if we should repete all things of holy scripture / which
preyse and co^me^de to us ye greatness of divine merci. The remena^t is / yt I
will exhort you in few words / yt none through presumpcion make him self
unworthy of the mercy of god / that is so ready: or through ill courage of my^de
despeyre of ye mercy of god. And after we will shortly declare / what things
provoke the mercy of god. And so make an end of our sermon / if the mercy of
our lord vouchesafe to be present and favorable unto me spekyng to you.

God aborreth nothing so mo^he as pride and obstaclenes: for he resists the
proud / and gives grace to the humble. To this blind madness and mad blyndnes
many are brought through prosperity of temporal goods / which as forgetful
of their maker they lyuen after their pleasure / so much vnthoughtfull to
amend their life / that they boost ungraciousness / strong and mighty in
wickedness. And as we read i^ an other place: They ^oste their ill doing / and
rejoice in most ungracious things: Whereof Solomon writes: The wicked man when
he comes to the bottu^ of yls / he is careless. And of such folk Paul
wrytethe: God gives them a peruersed judgment / to do those things / that be
not comely. Some of them promise them self / that they shall skape unpunished
for ever / and despise wholesome monyshyon / and will not here of such things
as should provoke them to repentance / saying: Let god have heaven him self /
let him leave us the earth. Of these speaks Moses in his canticle / when after
many great benefits of god to the people of Israel remembered / he adds: My
well-beloved is waxed gross and kycketh: he is waxed fat and brood: he has
forsaken god his maker, and is departed from god his savior. The psalm. 72.
peynteth this manner of me^: They be not in the labor of me^ / and they shall
not be scorged with me^. Because pride reteineth them / they be covered with
iniquite and their wickedness / they be gone in to affection of heart. They have
thought and spoken leudnes, and they have talked wickedly against almighty god.
They have set their mouth against the heaven / and their tongue is gone over in
earth. But herke what end follows this unhappy felicite. But yet for all
their wyles thou have begyled them / thou dyddest cast them down wha^ they
would ari^en up. How were they disco^^^ted? they failed suddenly / and perished
for their wickedness. Good lord i^ thy cite shall reduce ye image of them to
naught / as ye dream of them that rise from sleep. On them that following
Lucifers example rise up against god / shall fall yt our lord thretneth in ye
gospel: I saw Satanas as lightnyng fall from heaven. And Corozaim through
abundance of transitory things wickedly swellyng, hereth: Woe to the Corozaim /
for thou that a^te now lift up to heaven by thy pride / shall be plucte down
to hell by the vengeance of god. Paul also sometime on trust of his country
laws was fierce and proud / and thretned to slay the disciples of our lord /
and for ^^t by the right hand of god overthrown to the earth he hereth: It is
hard for ye to kycke agay^st ye prick. But because in his deed was error and
not wayward malice / he optayned mercy. As Soon as he aknowleged his syn / god
forgave him / and not only forgave him / but also of a wolf he made him a
sheep / and of a tyran a postle. But the curse of god hangs over them that
continue in sin / at last being indurated and obstinate therein / will not
understand to do well: which say to god: Go thy way from us / we will not have
knowledge of thy ways. Again they yt Esaie speaks of / which our lord
calling to weeping / waylyng, cuttyng of their hear / and to wear shertes of
hear / they make mirth and revel / kylling calves / and sacrifieng sheep / yt
they may eat the flesh / and drink wine / saying: Let us eat and drink /
for to morrow we shall dye. And they as the same prophet says / that scorn the
thretninges of god / steryng them to repent: Bid bid again / bid bid again,
abide abide again / abide abide again / a litel there a little there. And the
which say again in an other place: We will not here our lord / but we will
dye in our sins: to these as ye old proverb says / Patience often grieved
turns in to madness: and the mercy of our lord despised / is turned in to
greuouser dampnacion. For our lord mocked in Esaie answers after: The saying
of our lord to them shall be: Bid bid again / bid bid again / abide abide
again / abide abide again / a litel there a little there / that they may go
and fall backewarde / and be all to rent / and attrapped / and taken. These
unhappy folk go / left in their ill desires / always waxyng worse / they fall
in to the pyt of wickedness / they be tangled in the cords of syn / they be
taken in the net of everlasting da^nacion / leading their days among their
goods / and in a moment they go to hell. O very wretched creatures / and holly
given to distructio^ / which like as beastis be fatted to be kylde / whom
neither the enormite of syn makes to forgette pride / nor so great hyndnes of
god te^dreth them to repent. The mercy of god suffers the so often to sin /
yt thou should amend / he gives the space to repent, and in the mean while
he takes not from the his benignite / he gives the good health / he gives the
riches, he gives the other co^modites of ye life, as in manner setting up and
castyng coals of fire over thy heed / yt if thou can not hate thy syn, for
that it is most shamfull of hi^ self / yet at lest should begin to hate it /
since it displeases so loving a father. Eschinus a young man perceiving i^ a
play ye marvelous hyndnes of his father toward him offe^dy^g / was moved / yt
from the^s forth he would have him i^ greatter reverence / these be his words:
What thing is this? is this to be a fader / or this to be a son? If he were my
brother or fellow / how might he follow more my mind? Is he not to be loved?
ought he not to be borne in mind? Ah he makes me right careful with his
e^ynes / leest I should unware do ought contrary to his mind / for wittingly I
will beware thereof.

If fatherly hyndnes teache wytty children to hate syn / thou unhappy sinner
do thou wax more and more obstinate for so great goodness of thy father, and
herest not Paul calling y^ again from madness? Do thou despise says he, the
riches of thy goodness / patience / and mekenes? Know not that ye ge^tylnes
of god leads the to repentance? But after thy hardness and vnrepe^tant heart /
thou getherest unto the a treasure of anger in the day of anger / and the
reuelacio^ of the just judgment of god.

No beast is so wild, yt by men's diligence and labor is not tamed, and you
provoked by so excedy^g benefit of god / art also more fierce against him?
Nothing is so hard / that is not made soft by craft of me^. Brass melts
in the furnes / yro^ by fire is made soft / horn with wax poured in soupleth
/ the inui^cible hardness of ye diamond is ouerco^e with gottis blud: And o heart
harder than horn / harder than iron / harder tha^ the diamond / that neither
ye fire of hell / nor the hyndnes of thy most ge^tyl father / nor ye blud of
the undefiled lamb shed for the / can mollify: yea is made more harder than
all these. Now be joyful / make triumph of wickedness / you have overcome
wretch / thou haste ouerco^e divine craft / which is most unhappy victori.
Unhappy is the ground as Paul says / and nerest the curse of god / which
when it often receives heavenly moystnes / it bri^geth forth none other thing
but thorns and wydes: how much more unhappy is he / that is so often moisted
with rain of divine mercy / and waxes hard as any rough sturdy stone / that
he will receive no print of the holy ghost? The finger of god wrote the law to
Moses in stony tables / so that thy heart is sturdier tha^ these stones, where
in ye holy ghost can write nothing of Christis law. Who shall cut us these
stony hearts but he / whose death cloue ye stones / yt they might go out of
their tu^bes yt were deed? Who shall give us a fleshy heart but ye word of god /
that for us was made flesh? But yet they be more desperate tha^ these / which
reioysyng in their syns / spread abroad blasphemous and wicked opinions denyeng
god to be above, or if he be / that mortal folks busynes perteyne nothing to
him: to be no life after death of the body: no i^mortalite to be prepared for
them / that here lived dedeuoutly in Christ Jesus: nor hell ppared for them
that here served the devil: the thretnynges of holy scripture to be vain: the
promyses of the gospel to be lies: or they that by wrong expoundyng of
scripture / defend their mischeuous deeds for good actis: and the word of god
/ whereby the ill desires of the mind ought to be corrected / they compel to
supporte their fylthynes / to other crimes they lay the wickedness of heresy /
as most worste rebuke. The palenes / which for great skele appears in your
faces / and the tre^blyng of ye holle body / show how much ye abhor that
ye have herd. But would to god we might not here those things among christen
folk. I have showed you Scylla, on which rock many ru^ne and perish. Now I
will show you Charybdis / a danger greuouser tha^ ye most grievous and more
ferefull. They be they which following Cain and Judas the traitor / despeyre
of forgyuenes swaloweth in to everlasting distructio^. There is but one
destruction / though ye reason of perishyng be diverse. Pharao indurated says:
I know no lord / nor I will not let the people go. What says Cain? My syn is
greatter tha^ I may diserue perdon. And what says Judas? I have sinned
betraieng ye innocent blud. Both they aknowlege the greatness of their sin /
both they confess it / both repent their mysdede / but both they go away from
the face of our lord / in whom only is mercy and ple^tifull rede^tion from
sins. For thus ye read of Cain: And Cain going away from the face of our
lord / dwelled a ru^ne a gate in a country toward the Est. etc. And Judas
departing from the banquet of saynctes / returns not again: He is unhappy,
that so goes from the face of the mercy of god / that he returns not again.
This is he I think / that Ieremias means / when he says: Weep not for ye
deed ne mourn not for him: with weeping bewail him / that goes out / because
he returns no more again. He will not ye deed to be wept for / because
sometime he must arise again. He with all manner weeping should be wayled / yt
turns him self away from the well of everlasting life / and never by penance
returns again / from thens he went. That prodigal and riottous child went
away in to fer country / he left ye house of his most loving father / but he
is returned again. Peter swarued far from our lord / when he forsook him
thrice: but shortly aft he came again / wha^ he remembered the word that Jesus
spoke / he began to weep bytterly. He had forgotten him self / but when he
came to him self again / he returned to Jesus. Like wise Esaie cries:
Remember ye this / and be ye co^fu^ded and you sy^ners come to your heart
again. Peter remembered him self / and returned to his heart: the stony heart
was taken from him / the pomisehart, out of which no drop of tears could be
got: a flesh heart was given hy^ / out of which anon spra^ge a well of
tears / bitter for ye sorrow of penance / but wholesome for the innocency to him
restored. But Judas is not returned to Jesus / but he went away to ye prestes
and pharisees / he yielded again that woeful money / from thens he ro^ne to ye
snare / and brake a ^onder. These things our lord suffered among his
disciples for our instruction. Ye se how diverse ye end of two apostles
synnyng is. Judas yt was so often provoked by our lords m^kenes to be sorry and
amend, stacke still in his wicked purpose. But Peter at the lokyng of Jesus
upon him / remembered our lords saying / and by and by knew him self / and as
unworthy of our lords psence / he drew abacke / not to hang him self / but
to weep / that is / not to despeyre / but to remedy. Judas following Cain the
auctour of this mischief / aknowleged truly the greatness of his syn / but he
remembered not the words of our lord / that every where in holy scripture
provoke us to return / that stere us to do penance / and promise us mercy. For
what padge is in holy scripture / that sou^deth na^ the mercy of god? I speak
not only of the new testament / that is the law of grace / but also of the
old testament / that is thought more rigorous. Let us here how ge^tilly our
lord in ye prophet Jeremy / that under the person of the spouse leauyng her
husband, aba^doneth her every where to every body / he reclaymeth his people
to penance: Turn to me says he / ye children returny^g again / says our
lord, for I am your husband. And in Job our lord opens the ear of the
sinners, that he may correct them: and speaks / that they should return from
wick^d^es. But they be wre^ches / yt against this our lords voice stop their
ears / like the de^^e edder / that stops her ears for the none^ lest a
should here the voice of the enchanter wisely: To day says the psalm / if ye
here his voice / be not hard hearted. To day is ours / as long as we be in
this life / which all the while hit lasts / our lord cesseth not to speak
to us / stery^g us to do penance / offryng forgyuenes, ppared. What / said I
forgyuenes? The mercy of god is more which promises to them that return a
precious gift. For thus we read in Job: If thou wylt return to almighty god /
thou shalt be edifyed / and shalt void wickedness far from thy tent: for earth
he shall give the a flynt stone, and for a flint stone golden ryuers. Let us
here the mercy of our lord in Esaie steryng us to repentance: If ye seek says
he / seek / return and come: if ye seek the end of yuels / seek hit not in
children of men / in whom is no salvation / nor of e^chantours / nor by hangyng
your self / but ask it of me / that alone both may and am ready to forgive.
Only return from those things / that ye fylthily have loved / and turned /
come to me. Again in the same prophet / e^tysyng al mankind to him / he
says: Am not I a lord? and there is no more god but I: God just and holy is
none beside me: return to me / and ye shall be ^aued all the costis of the earth
/ for I am god / and there is none other. These words our lord speaks to
gentiles, idolworshippers / to ma^kyllers, church robbers / ^echers,
blasphemers: and thou wretch by dispeyre would turn away from our lord? In
old time when sin unpunished rayned among folk / the merry of god seemed to
be drawn within ye narow bounds of Iudee. But by the gospel mercy spread over
all costs of the world: In Ieremye also he thretneth the obstinate / but he
offers them forgyuenes prepared that repent and amend: If that folk says
he, will do penance for their sin / that I have spoken against them / I will
also do penance upon ye harm / that I thought have done them. And he yt a
lyttel before thretned destruction / pluckyng up by the rotes / and sparklyng
about / promyseth things contrary, and suddenly says: I wyl^ speak of the
people and realm / that I may edify it / and that I may plant it. Like wise
in Ezechiel he not only promises him perdo^ yt turns again / but also that
he would forget all the sins that he had done before: For when he had before
remembered every kind of myschefes and damnable deeds / he adds: If the
wicked man will do penance for all the sins that he has wrought / and will keep
al my co^mandementes / and will do judgment and iustice^ he shall live and shall
not dye: I will not remember all the iniquitees that he has wrought. Is it my
will says our lord / that a sinner should dye / and not rather yt he should
be converted from his sins and live? And a little lower: Be ye converted and
do penance for all your sins / and your wickedness shall not distroye you:
throw away all your offenses / whereby ye have tra^sgressed: and make you a new
heart and a new spirit. And why die ye the house of Israel? Because I will not
the death of ye dyeng treature says our lord / turn again and come. Why
despeyrest thou wretch / since god for this sent down his son in to this
world / y^ y^ should have good hope? He him self undoubted is the mercy of
god, of whom David syngeth: O god we have received thy mercy in ye myddis of
thy church. Be thou i^ the church / and enbrace mercy. He rysyng cries: I
will not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted and live.
Here this voice thou unhappy sinner / shake of deedly sleep / rise again with
Christ / that thou may live in him. For he revived / to the end ye death of syn
should not always possess the. And if any body suspect yt this mercy of god is
not ppared / nor ready / but for these that commit few and light syns / let him
here what our lord with a clear voice promises: When so ever a sinner
bewayleth his sins / I will forget al his iniquitees. He excepteth no kind
of sin, he po^dreth not the greatness or multitude of offenses. Be sorry only /
and forgetfulness of all thy syns past is ready. For small offenses / without
which ma^s frailte lives not, we call daily upon the mercy of god / saying:
Dimitte nobis debita nostra. etc. For give us as we forgive them that offe^de
us: And we be herd / if we here our neighbor prayenge / that we should forgive
him. And also among deedly sins is a certain order / as among me^ some
sleep not very sou^dly / so that with a litel whistry^g they awake: there be
that sleep more depely / that one must speak loud to wake them: there be that
sleep most depely / that uneath with great tuggy^ge they will awake: so with god
some be lighter deed / some more grievously / and some most grievously. But no
kind of death is so desperate and deedly, yt he with his voice dryueth not
away / at whose voice also they rise again / that were deed i^ their graves:
and no man is taken with so deep slou^bre of death / that is not by him raised.
This threfold difference of sinners ye devout interpreters of holy scriptures
suppose signified to us by three corses that we read were raised from death to
life by our lord Jesus. The master of the sinagogis daughter / a maid.xij.
year of age / he raised in ye house / a few admytted to se it / and he forbade
to tell abroad that was done. These be they / yt first not of purposed malice
/ but either by sleprenes of age / or by man's frailnes / be so slyden in to some
sin / yt they be not yet obstinate in ill / nor yet no foul rumor runs
of that mysdede. Our lord Jesus lightly reyseth those with his hand put for
the / hydynge their fylthynes / and prouidynge for their shamefastnes. But he
raised up the wyddowes son with more busynes. Now the carkeys was carried
to the graue^and in going our lord met them, he moved with ye sely womans
weping / bade them stand still that bare the biere, he raised the young man.
First he sittech up / soon aft he speaks / shortly after he skyppeth out of
the coffyn / and is delivered to his mother again. These be they undoubted /
that be so fer iro^ne in sin that they be infamy can not be reclaymed from
synnyng: they by open penance little and little be reised again to life. He
sits up / which forsakyng syn, lyfteth up hy^ self to ye purpose of a
better life. He speaks, that co^fessyng his foul sins / aknowlegeth ye
mercy of god. He is yielded to his mother a live / that aft al remedies
accomplished / is restored to the communion of the church again. Lazarus
truly now stanke in his grave. He is bewailed only of his de^perate systers
and fre^des / here Jesus byddeth to show him the grave / he wepeth / he make
the gri^ely soune with his mouth / and is troubled in spirit / he commands
to take away the stone / and with a loud voice he byddeth him to come forth:
he comes forth / but he is bound / he is losed / and so at last he is yielded
to his systers again. It was no great thing for our lord to reyse a
carkeys.iiij. days deed / it is a greatter maystrie to reyse a sinner /
that.xl. years lived not / but lay stynkyng defiled with all manner fylthy sin.
A child says Esaie of an hundred years shall dye / and a sinner of an hundred
years shall be cursed. And ye same our lord Jesus will vouchesafe to reyse / so
yt he at last will here him calling. He cries daily / arise mayde^ / arise
young man / come forth Lazare. But hell as many / more than deed / here not his
voice calling us again to life. But what thing is to here but to believe?
Incredulite or hard belefe stops the ears of wicked folks / that ye voice
of holy scripture can not enter i^ to their minds. Let us pray the mercy of
god / that he will vouchesafe to sou^de out aloude his almighty voice / and to
sing it to those wretched and desperate folk: Thou deffe and du^me spirit /
I command the / get ye out of this man / and enter no more in to him. Now to
the end ye may se more plainly how ready the mercy of god is to him that
repe^teth and ame^deth / here Dauyd^ I have said / I will aknowlege against me
mine unrighteousness to our lord: and thou have forgyuen me the wickedness of my
syn. Not yet co^fe^sed but to one only myndyng confession ye mercy of god
runs. Be sorry / confess the / but let it be before god. Many wayle before me^
/ they weep in ye sight of people / they confess them to men / they rent their
clothes / but it is before ye people, they wear ye hear / they spryncle ashes
on their heed / but it is before y^ people. Which things if they were done
before god / yt is to say / with all the heart / with pure affection / ye mercy
of god cesseth not. Cut and rent says he / your hearts and not your garments.
For god will not despise a contrite and an humble heart. Let us weep says the
psalm writer / before god / that made us. Many fast / but not the fast that
our lord wylleth: many change their raiment / but they change not their
affection. And yet it is so / that these things also must be done among men /
that they / whom our malice provoked to sin / may be called again by penance
to amend. But these things are unprofitably done among the people / except
they be first done in the ^yght of god Judas confessed his syn / but it was to
the pharisees: if he had confessed him to our lord, by and by the most mild
mercy of our lord had e^braced him. And to the end our confession may be more
acceptable to god / Osee ye prophet shows to us also ye form of confession:
Take says he with you words, and return to our lord / and say to him /
Take away al iniquite from us / and receive good / and we shall give the again
the calves of our lyppes. Let us also / that have wandered many ways, return
to him again / that alone takes away the sins of the world / ye which for
our sins shed his precious blud / let us say to him: Take away from us all the
ill / that we wickedly wrought. What freely? And receive good / what good? The
calves of our lyppes. We shall give thanks to thy mercy / whereto we be bound
for every good deed we did after our fall, thou shall take from us yt is ours,
and shall receive of us yt is thine. Ye but se how well with him accords the
prophet Iohel / expressyng the same sentence with other words, for when god by
him had sharply thretned those that regarded not his mercy to them offered /
this he brings in after: Return to your god / for he is myld and merciful,
pacient and of much mercy / and repe^tyng upon malice. The greatness of sins
overthrows y^ / but ye greatness of goddis mercy can lift y^ up again. se by
how many ways the prophet amp^^fieth it. He is gentle, orels as hit is in
Greek merciful. Though this was enough that we should not despeyre / yet he
adds: And having pite, yt we may understand, yt he not only helps us, but
also is sorry for our iuels. And herwith not co^te^t / he adds pacient / that
is to say easy / and nothing hasty to take vengeance / like as humayn mercy is
lightly turned to dysdayne. And yet o sinner thou despeyrest. Herke^ therefore
yt follows. And of much mercy. If thy sins by many, mistrust not, mercy is
much. What remains now / but that you must be converted / and go to him
entisyng ye? But if ye punysheme^tes of mercy fear yt, herke and take courage:
And taking repentance of his malice. He calls the peynes and afflictions that
are due for our sins malice. He takes away sin / He forgyueth everlasting
pain deserved. What rests tha^? nothing, but that thou should aknowlege
the mercy of god. Undouted this is it yt follows in Iohel. And he shall leave
after him blessyng and sacrifice to our lord god. Truly this is it yt Osee
said: The calves of the lyppes / that is to say / sacrifice of preyse and
thank gyuyng. If any grievously and often should offend a mortal man / how
hard is the making at one, how minds he the wro^ges / how slowly asswageth
the anger / how lightly for a trifyl falls he in ye old grudge, how
frowardly asks he amendis for the offense: and yet if they so receive them in
favor again / they be called gentyl. God so often offended / willingly
provoke us to repentance / he entiseth us to forgyuenes, he perdoneth
thretninges, he forgyueth hell pain / he offreth for punyshement benignite /
yea and he not only tu^neth his face toward the sinner / mendyng and repentyng
/ but voluntarily he meteth him turnyng again / and with his arms spread
abroad he wol enbrace him converted. Undouted the same is it that he promises
in zacarie: Turn ye to me says the lord of ostis, and I will turn to you
says the lord of ostis. What is that to say^ Turn ye to me? aknowlege your
wretchedness / and desire my mercy. What is: and I will turn to you? By and by
I of a revenger and punysher made an helper / will help forward your purposes
/ that ye can not bring to pass by your own stre^gthes / ye may opteyne it
by my favor. No man could holsomely hate his syn / but if god granted hit /
except he take away the stony heart / and put in a sleshie heart: but if for a
defiled heart he work in us a clean heart / except for an ill spirit he renew
in our bowels a good just spirit. But why take I this labor to reherce some
old places of scripture / which declaren the marvelous mercy of god? All the
scripture of y^ old testament alabout preaches / syngeth / and lays before
us the mercy of god. And where be those fra^ticke foles rather than heretics
/ that of one make two goddis / one of the old testament / that was only
just and not good: the other of the new / that should be only good and not
just / could they not at leest wise here this song / that is so often times
rehearsed in the psalm.Cxvij. Aknowlege to god / that he is good / and that his
mercy is in all worlds. Where is mad Manicheus / that taught in his books /
that he that speaks to us so louyngly by his prophettes / and that did ordeyne
Moses law / was no very god / but one of the wicked dyuels. The self same
is god of both the laws / the same troth / the same mercy by Jesus Christ our
lord / save that in Moses law be shadows / in the gospel troth: in the
other was promise / in this is perfourmance: in that was much and great mercy
toward the Jews / here is the holle well of mercy / or rather the sea / that
has flowen over all nations of the holle world / by which flode the syns of
al mortal creatures are washed and skoured away. Surely this was the happy
flode of mercy: the old flode (a few saved) distroyed ye sinners: this
wholesome flode washes away ye syns / and saves al yt believe in the son of
god. He that in books of the old testament promyseth the Hebrews repe^tyng
and ame^dyng / forgyuenes / the same present in the gospel cries to every man:
Come to me all that labor and be laden / and I will refreshe you. Take my yocke
upon you / and ye shall find rest for your souls. For my yocke is sweet / and
my burden light. Read the life of Christ over and over / what thing else se
ye therein / but continual mercy toward every body? He healed sick folk freely
/ he fed the hu^gry / he succored them that were in peril / he made lepers
holle and clean / he gave the blind their sight, and restored ye lame their
lymmes / he drove away dyuels / he raised deed me^ to life / he assoyled them
yt were repe^ta^t. Again / search out al his techyng / what other thing does
it sauer / tha^ excedy^g great mercy of god? By how many parables printeth he
ye same in our my^des, yt we should slide no way^ For what other thing shows
the parable of the sheep brought again on ye sheperdis shulders / of ye piece
of money lost and found / of the holle folk that need a phisicio^ / of ye
servant to whom all his duyte is given / again of the vserer / that forgave
both the dettours, of the publican and pharisee / of ye pilgrim hurt, whom the
samaritan heals, of ye cur^ese steward to his dettours / of ye disceiuer of
his master / of the ryottous child received again? And the very cleapynge of
the gospel / does it not by and by promise mercy? What promises hit? To
blind sight, to prisoners perdon, to ye broken holnes / shortly to speak a
year acceptable to our lord / that desires none other thing but man's
salvation. Now the same name of Jesus / that is of a savior / what other
thing promyseth it but salvation and mercy? If he had proclaimed him self a
judge / it had be^ somewhat why one should have be^ afraid, now thou herest
savior / and despeyrest of salvation? And so forth / to the end ye trust of
salvation should seem more certain, because it would seem unlikely / that so
great a lake of sins / that all mankind was defiled with / should be purged
and cle^sed with the blud of gottis and calves / he the son of god got up on
the auter of ye cross / and for our sins he offered him self most effectual
sacrifice to cle^se all our sins. And hanging on the same cross / he prayed
for them that crucified him / for them y^ revile and rail upon him: and
thynkest thou aknowlegyng thy syn / and sorowfully besechyng his mercy he will
deny ye forgyuenes? Trust to him merciful / and you shall find mercy, what
thing is it ye faith opteyneth not of Christ? He that mistrusteth the
phisicio^ / is his own let / that he can not have his health again. Truly so
much god inclyneth to the prayers of wretches cryenge to him / yt he gives
mercy at one other man's prayer, if he have a good hope with him. The Canane
cries to him, and her daughter is made holle: ye Centurion trusts / and his
servant is restored to his health: the master of the Synagoge prays / and his
daught is reliued: the father desires, and his son is delivered of a wicked
dyuel. The apostles cry: O lord save us / we perish / and they be al saved.
In many folks he ^aried not the prayers of the mouth^ he sees ye faith of the
cariers / and says to the man sick of ye palsy. Trust son thy sins be
forgyue^ the. The mother only / and they that went with her wept / and ye young
man yt was deed arises / Martha and Mary do nothing but weep and Lazer
relyueth. Mary the sinner wepeth / she annoynteth and kysseth him / and she
hereth: Thy sins be forgyuen the. He prays enough that knowlegeth his
sickness; he prays vehemently that wepeth and hops. The woman diseased with
the blody flixe / privily touches the garment of Jesus / and forth with she
felt ye power of mercy coming forth. Like wise we read yt many other were
cured by touchy^g ye garments of Jesus. So ready his mercy is every where / and
at every occasion he succoureth wretches. If you darste not call upon Jesus / if
thou can not touch Jesus / at lest touch privily ye skyrt of his garment /
go to some holy man / in whom this virtue shyneth / that with his prayers he may
commend the to our merciful lord. For by them often times he puts forth
his power / being ready on every side to give salvation to every man. For yt
intent he came / this was the food, wherewith he was fed, yt he might draw
sinners to repe^ta^ce. And in the book of Genesis also / when wicked folk by
their mischeuous deeds provoked the wrath of our lord yet at the prayer of
Abraham our lord had forgyue^ many cities appointed to be distroied / if he
could have found.x. good men among the people. The people of Israel had
deserved to be distroied / and our lord at the prayers of Moses restrayneth
the sword of vengeance. O blind and unkind folk / that regard not the mercy
of our lord / that is so metyng / and so ready every where: but more unhappy be
they that wyllingly despeyre of that / ye freely is offered them. He is lightly
pleased / which not willing is reue^ged. For what other thy^g souneth this
voice: And why dye ye the house of Israel? Again in an other place he
bewayleth / that he all the day had spread abroad his hands to the people
without believe / and striuyng against him. Again in Micheas: My people / what
have I done to ye / or wherein have I grieved the answer me? Like wise in Esaie:
What is hit that I ought to have done more to my vine / and have not done it?
Our lord does every thing / that he might save us / and shall we wylfully cast
away hope of salvation? In the gospel also he wepeth for Jerusalem / the
which through obstinacy of syn caused distructio^ of it self. How often /
says he / would I have gethered the to gether / as the hen gethereth her
chekyns under her wings / and ye would not? Our most merciful lord wepeth /
that he can not lefully save wretches / and mystruste we him / as though he
would not save us? In the gospel all the house ru^bleth for joy / that the
child that was deed / relyued again, yt ye perished, was recovered again. He
the good father exhorts the holle company of a^gels and saints to rejoice
al to gether, that one sinner is brought again to penance, and thou wretch
despeirest / and enuiest thyn own salvation / and to our lord fo passing
great joy? Believe we that he / whom the death of sinners greueth / whom the
conuertyng of wicked folk gladdeth / will deny forgyuenes to them, yt be sorry
and amend? He calls every body to the brydale / he will have his house full /
yea he compels the blind and lame to enter in to his house. Why tariest thou
behind wretch? Why can not thou be drawn from the draffe of swyne? Why
striuest thou agay^st ye mercy of our our lord? Christ is the wisdom of god.
This wisdom as says Solomon departed out of her fathers house / came in to
this world, preaches openly / and her voice is herd in the streets. She
cries in the fro^te of multitudes / in ye wickettes of ye cite gates, she
pronou^seth out her words / saying: How long will ye love childhed ly^tell
babes / and foles, covet things noyfull to them / and indiscreet hate
counnyng? Turn you to my correction. Behold I will put forth my spiri^e to you
and shall show you my words. What thing is more folishe / than for vain
transitory things to be deprived of euerlasty^g goods? What is greatter
wisdom / than by short sufferance to get immortalite? Therefore they be all
mad that continue in sin: they be wise that change their life in to better.
With what great labors search we out the most vile thing among meta^s / and
so great treasure offered and freely offered we despisen / or yt is more folyshe
/ we despeyre^? God is rich in mercy. The treasure of humayn riches is
consumed in gyuynge away: the treasure of mercy can not be consumed. And this
will I add, that I may the more put every body from despeyre of pardone. God
has bound his faith to man / and as Paul ^ayth / he can not deny him self.
He refuse^h not to be rebuked / if he perform ^at / that he promyseth. For so
he speaks in Esaie to the people defiled on every side: Be ye washed / be
clean / take away from my sight your ill thoughts / cesse to do wickedly /
learn to do well / seek judgment / succor the oppressed / deal truly with ye
orphlin / defend ye wydow / and come ye and rebuke me / says our lord. Thou
herest ^ynner / what thing else requires our merciful lord / but only
cha^gyng of thy life? And lest thenormite of sins ouerpresse thy mind / here
the forgyuenes of them all ready. If your sins says he / were as skarlette /
they shall be made as white as snow: and if they were as red as oker / they
shall be as white as wolle. If ye will and ye may here me / ye shall eat the
goods of ye earth? Who is so mad / that will not be saved? What is more easy /
tha^ to here our most loving father / nothing co^mandyng / but that perteyneth
to our felicite? If ^e will says he / and ye may here. No man may save him y^
will not. Salvation is by faith / faith is vy hering. The word is helthfull in
thy heart and in thy mouth. Only shut not ye ears of thy^ heart. Now if a king
should say thus to his e^mies or to such as be co^uicted of high treason: What
so ever is done or was intended hitherto, I forgive it you al, mercy is ready
for all, so they from the^s forth would absteyne from like ill deeds: would not
every body speak of ye kings wonderful mercy, yt neither cruelly punishes
their bodies, nor co^fisketh their goods? But god yea with reward entiseth us
to amend our life. Ye shall eat says he, the goods of the earth. But they be
utterly unworthy to have ye fruicion of goods of this world / that by their
ungracious deeds offend the gyuer of all. But o how much more precious is it
that ye gospel promises: I will give you a new heart / I will give you a new
spirit / whereby of the dyuels thrals / ye shall be made the children of god /
whereby y^ shall be made me^bres of mine only begotten son / and whereby ye shall
enter into the heretage of the heavenly kingdom. This is says he / my
well-beloved son / here him. O thou Jew / why turn^st thyn ears from troth /
and turnest to the tales of the Talmudicens / and Deuterotis? Thou unwise
philosopher / why shuttest thyn ears against this techer, and herkenest to
Plato and Aristotel? Why herest thou unhappy progeny of Eve ye serpent with
vain promises entisynge the to destruction / and herest not the son of god
calling the to the company of everlasting felicite? Do penance says he / the
kingdom of heaven is at hand. The son promises / the father pledgeth it / the
holy ghost in the mean while is given as an ernest penny: and doutest thou to
take and e^brace so great felicite offered ye? And there is none other voice of
thapostles tha^ of our lord, Do penance, and let each of you be baptized in
the name of Jesus Christ in remission of your sins / and ye shall receive the
gift of the holy ghost. And a litel aft: Keep you from this ungracious nation /
yt ye may be saved: leave the spotted, fylthy, wretched life / and take
everlasting life. Soldiers, publicans, harlottes, idolworshippers,
ma^kyllers, nigroma^cers, baudes, aduoutrers, ru^ne hither. None is shut
without / the passage to mercy lies egally open to all. The life past is not
regarded / so one be repe^tant. Nor thou should not suppose this mercy of our
lord / to stretche no farther tha^ batisme, though Mo^tanus shut ye church
doors against them that slide after baptism / our lord never shuts the
door of ye heavenly kingdom. The entrance in to the church by baptism is ones
given / the figure whereof the arc of No^ bears / but by the mercy of god ye
second bourde is left to each after the ship wrack / yea to come again in to
ye arc by penance. For baptyme is not twice taken / as the death of Christ is
not renewed / but the water of tears does remain / wherewith now the fylthy
sins ben washed away, ye soap of wholesome contricion remains / and the herb
of Bo^ith. Truly they ought / to whom ones all sins were freely forgyuen, and
that buried with Christ by baptism rose with him again in a new life, to
co^tynue with him in that great gift / that they received. But our pitefull and
merciful lord knowing the weakness of man's nature / he wylled remedy of
penance to be ready for each even to the lives end. But because the day of death
is certain to none / all ought to watch / that they despise not ye goodness of
god: but if they hap to slide again / by and by they should have to remedy /
before ye disease by continuance wax incurable. Some i^ old time with right
great peril forbear baptism eue^ to the last day of their life / whom some
called bad christiens / and some / ill watered / as christie^s not very true:
but with more ieperdy ye sinner prolo^geth the remedy of penance / that is
every where ready. The christener is not always present / but lyeng in thy bed
thou may confess thyn unrighteousness to our lord / and purpose to amend thy
life. One is not always present to wash thy body: tears be always present, with
which thou may wash ye fylthes of thy soul. And not without a cause a dout
is / whether ye baptism be effectual / whereby wha^ there is no hope of life /
and were in pa^ges of death / were rather spryncled with water than baptized.
For they showed yt they would a sinned continually if they might have lived
still. But much more southly great learned men doubt / whether penance be
fruteful / yt is prolo^ged a purpose / now depertyng hence they take it / and
would not take it / except death compelled them. For like as ground often moysted
with heavenly rain, bry^geth forth naught else to his tyller / than thorns and
wydes / is cursed and cast in to ye fire: so god other while for his goodness
obstacly despised, endueth them with a peruersed mind. Wherefore ye surest way
most dear brethern^ is / not to prolonge the mendyng of the life / but by and
by at the voice of our lord, calling us to do of ye old man with his deeds and
desires / lest our lord so often not herd / will not here us again calling to
him. Dredeful is ye voice, wherewith he thretneth them that will not here him
mercifully cally^g. Because says he I called you / and ye turned away: I
reched forth my hand / and there was none that would se it: ye despised al my
counsel / and set naught by my rebukes: I also will laugh and scorn i^ your
destruction, wha^ it shall fall on you that ye drad. When sudden calamite
overthrows / and ruin as a tempest dassheth down / when trouble and greffe
assayleth: than they will call on me / and I will not here them. They shall arise
yerly / and they shall not find me, because they hated my lernyng / and would
not co^ceyue the dread of their lord / and would not rest upon my counsel,
and would withdraw from al my correction. God punishes diverse ways, yt he
might correct us. At last wha^ our obstaclenes has ouerco^e al remedies he
forsakes us as desperate / and leaves us with our own fre will. Like as a
phisicio^ assaynge al yt his craft can to put away the disease / when he sees
the pacient forsake all medicines / at last he leaves him with his sickness /
as he that will not live. Mercy says the psalm / and judgment I will sing to
ye. The day of judgment abides al after they shall be departed this life. As
long as this life lasts, there is hope of mercy. Therefore while thou lyuest
beseech our lord mercy. But they that lie dyeng / or they that extreme old
age opresseth / now in a manner live no more. Here ye counsel of the wise
Hebrewe / what ever thou be that from day to day drawest the lynde of wickedness
/ and make no end of synnynge: Turn the to our lord says he / and forsake
thy sins. Pray the face of our lord and mynishe thyn offenses. Return to
our lord, and turn away from thyn ungraciousness / and hate cursynge: and
know the justices and iugementes of god / and stand in the lot of proposicion
and speech of almighty god / go in to the parts of the just world with ye
living and gyuyng confession to god. Thou should not abide in the error of
wicked folk / confess y^ before death. The confession of one deed perishes
as nothing. Thou shall confess the living. Alive and in health thou shall
confess / and preyse god / and glorify in his mercies / o how great is the
mercy of our lord / and his favor to them that return to him. Thou herest ye
great mercy of god is ready / but that is if thou alive and in heal wylt be
confessed to our lord. But what shall we say of them / whose bodies be unable
to sin / and yet ye mind puts not away the sinful appetite: and when by
reason of age the body is nere deed / that they can not do wicked and fylthy
acts / yet they leave not to speak leudly? How should they be confessed to
our lord alive / that leave sooner to live tha^ to sin? But thou young man
in thy flowryng age / why prolo^gest the me^dyng of thy life / days / months
/ and years? If thy body were diseased with the dropsy / and thou had
before ye ready a certain sure remedy for yt disease / would you say / The
next year I will heal my sickness? I know well you would not be so mad / but
you would haste most gredily to be healed. And i^ ye diseases of ye soul
much more perilous / tariest / driuest forth from day to day / from that day
to that / yea thou defferrest thy salvation to ye day of thy death? And who is
thy surete, that thou shall live till to morrow? But these things be not spoken
/ to the end that any should despeyre of forgyuenes / but to thente^t we would
wrest from ^che the careless continuance in sin. There is sin / yt neither
in this world nor in the world to come, is forgyue^. God forbid yt any of us
should swerve so far wide. And therefore ye most sure thing is to eschew sin.
The next is, that by and by we put it away by penance / that is wrought
vnskylfully. A good man falls.vij. times on a day, but he rises again: al
though this be spoken by venial syns. And therefore our lord often times
thretneth us sharply in holy scripture / lest on trust of forgyuenes ready / we
should walowe in to the myer of ungracious deeds. And therefore ye plaster of
penance is not given, that we wylfully should continue in our disease / but
lest he which perchance falls should be lost for ever. In Amos our lord often
thondreth against three or four wyckednessis: Shall not I abhor them? It is
wyckednes to think ill. Here by and by we should take repentance / but (...)
is greatter wickedness to will to perform it yt thou dyddest mind: at lest
from ye grice y^ foot should step to better. But the greuoust offense is /
fylthyly to perform it yt thou dyddest wickedly purpose. And here we be
neither sorry nor amend / but we put to it ye fourth wickedness / accustomyng us
in ^yns / and heapyng syns upon syns. Now at this poy^t may not our lord well
abhor us? Yes truly / nere yt his mercy passed his justice. Behold what
follows after so sharp thretny^ges in ye same prophet: This says our lord
to the house of Israel: Seek / and ye shall find me / seek your lord and come.
Let us here our lord thretnyng / lest we should syn: let us here our lord
reclaymyng us / yt we despeyre not. Orels woe to us if he should do to us that he
thretneth by the prophet: and after the third or fourth wickedness he should
turn away from us his mercy / and leave us alone to our will. Yea with many of
us it should go yuel / if our lord should turn his face away after the
thousand wickedness. But by and by as his rightousnes begins to wax
rigorous. Mercy steppeth forth and says: O lord god be merciful: I pray the /
who shall lift up Jacob for he is a babe? And again: O lord god I pray the
cesse who shall reyse up Jacob for he is a babe? Thus Mercy our best defender
pledeth the cause of our frailnes. Now here how ready forgyuenes is to one
repentyng and amendyng. Our lord says he / has had pite upon him. It shall
not be / said our lord. Ye se how soon he thretnynge vengeance repents, if
we truly would repent our misdedes. It shall not be / said our lord. I pray
you, what mother is so lightly pleased with her child? Therefore sith we have a
lord so easy to please / and an aduocatrice so effectual / what thing is there
/ why any despeyryng of him self / should either continue in sins / or with
Judas flee to hang him self? Even for the same purpose our lord by all means
myndyng our salvation / suffered most excellent and most approved me^ to fall
in grievous sins / that by their example he might courage and comfort us to
hope of perdone. What thing in holy scripture is more laudable tha^ king
David? He was a king he was a prophet, he was a man to gods mind / of his
lineage Christ was promised. But into how foul / in to how many fold a
sin did so great a man fall? He hereth of Nathan ye rebuke and cruel
thretnynges of our lord. But David with two words turns all this anger of
god in to mercy. He said: I have offended against my lord: And forth with
Nathan said: Our lord also has transported thy syn thou shall not dye. The
thretninges be of a length / yt he may correct / but how swyft is the voice of
mercy: Thou shall not dye? Like wise by Esaie Ezechias he^eth: Thou shall dye,
and shall not live. Ezechias wept and made great lamentacion. The prophet the
messanger of death was not yet gone half the kings court / but the mercy of
our lord called him again, saying: Return back / and say to Ezechias
captain of my people: This says our lord ye god of David thy father / I
have herd thy prayers / and have seen thy weeping / and I have healed the. The
third day after this thou shall go in to the temple of our lorde^ The third
book of kings witnesses ye same of Achab. There was not such an other as
Achab / which was sold to thente^t he might do mischife in ye sight of our
lord. And he hereth: Thou has^ kylde / and more over have possessed: As wha^
he had slain Na both he occupied his vineyarde: but a^ last he was so afraid
with ye cruel thretnynges yt he re^te his clothes / and ware a sherte of hear,
he fa^sted, and slept in woollen, and wandered ha^gynge down his heed. A^hab was
froward, he had often despise^ our lord rebukyng him, he had heaped syns upon
syns: and at last he was rather feared with dread of mischefes hangyng over him
/ than myndyng to repent and amend: and yet our lord of exceeding mercy
speaks to Hely: Have not seen how Achab has humbled him before me: because he
has humbled him self for my sake, I will bring in no mischief in his days.
If yt might of false repe^ta^ce b^ so great / that it can wrest the reue^gyng
sword out of the hand of god / what shall the mind do, truly changed in to a
contrary affection and now not for dread of punisheme^t, but for the love of
god abhors yt he miswrought: For that intent he suffered Peter / which he
had appointed chief of his church / openly to fall. He wept only / and
opteined mercy. When he delivered his sheep to him to feed / for which he
suffered death / did he cast in his tethe / y^ offense of thrice forsakyng our
lord? No forsothe / for now all that was so washed away with tears that there
remained not a step in our merciful lords remembrance. Paul ye persecuter
of our lordis church was overthrown, and was made ye teacher of nations. We
have great examples of them that sinned / and eke of them that repented / we
ought not by example of any to be provoked to sin / lest we should te^pte our
lord / but if any should hap to be attrapped by sin / he has examples of
repe^ta^ce / lest he should despeire. But they do waywardly / that will not
follow him in repe^tyng / which they followed in synnynge. How many princes be
there that smyle at their auoutres and ma^slaughters for the example of David?
Al though in David were so many excellent virtues / yt this offense might have been forgyue^ in reco^pe^ce of them: but would to god like as they follow him
offendyng / they would so follow him eke repentyng. He spread abroad his sin
through al nations of the world: and despised ye delectacions of the court /
and for purpul he wears a sherte of hear / and as bread he ^ateth ashes /
and mingleth his drink with wepy^g: every night he wassheth his bed with
tears / and moysteth his couerled with weping. And he was not ashamed to say
and sing this verse of penance to al sinners: Have mercy upon me lord after
thy great mercy. And after the multitude of thy mercies put away my wickedness.
He was judge / and gave sentence of death against him self. For greatly
disdaynyng he says: Our lord lives / for he is the child of death that
has done this thing. He could not more evidently be condemned: than by his
own word. God was judge / and yet as the person were changed / he committed
the judgment to him that was gylty. The judge was taken with a trip / and he
overcame that committed to him ye judgment: David was happily overcome / god
overcame mercifully / wha^ he showed ye sinner to him self / that had forgot
him self. Before as a co^querour / and dro^ken with unhappy prosperity / he
accomplished his pleasure with ye woman yt he loved, he delited in his most
sweet child / but when he was converted to our lord / than at last he saw
where he was: and what difference was bitwene a rightous man and an vnrightous,
like as an other prophecy teaches. Wha^ a sinner with all his heart aknowlegeth
his fylthynes / and confesses him self worthy of punysheme^t / tha^ our lord
is justified / and ouercometh when he is iuged / that is / when he offreth the
judgment to man as to be iuged him self. But they that ordeyne their own
rightousnes / make god in a manner unjust and a lier / which will that his
mercy should be known in every man, and rejoices to turn our unrighteousness i^
to his glory: seeing where sin was plentiful there his fre liberalite
abu^deth. The old Adam did not so, but when he was called to confession / he
laid the blame on his wife. Like wise she called to co^fessio^^ blamed the
serpent. If they could have song the song of David, God have mercy on me, they
had not ben banished paradise. Cain not going out of kind / what says he /
provoked of our lord to repent. Am I my brothers keeper? If he had said, I have
sinned / have mercy: and if he had said hit with all his heart, the mercy of
god was ready. There is a carnal sorrow / that engenders death / such as Judas
had: but again there is a godly sorrow / that brings forth salvation and
sure joy. Paul tenderly louedde all his / yet he reioyseth that he had cast
the Corinthies in such a sorrow / he damned / that had a do with his fathers
wife / as out of such sorrow / as after a bitter plaster follows continual
joy. And in ye mean while sure hope of salvation myngl^d with repentance
te^pereth the bitterness of the sorrow. So David / when he had simply confessed
his sin, and ye deserved wreache of god, herke how much hope he conceived
of the mercy of god: O lord said he / spryncle me with isope / and I shall be
cleansed / thou shall wash me / and I shall be made whiter than ye snow. Not of
his own good deeds, but by sprin^lyng of ye i^maculate la^bes blud he
promises him self pureness, and when he aknowleged him self from his mothers
womb with spots defyl^d / yet out of yt washing he hops to have fairenes
of innocence / that should pass the snow in whitenes. And he does not only
hope to opteyne innocency again / but also that ye woe of penance should turn
in ^o spiritual joy. He says: Thou shall give joy and gladness to my hery^g /
and my humble bones shall lepe for joy. Yield to me the gladness of thy
salvation, and co^fyrme me with thy principal spirit. O wonderful trust of a
sinner, and yet more largely he promyseth him self somewhat: And my tongue says
he / shall show outward with great mirth thy justice. O lord thou shall open
my lyppes / and my mouth shall show thy preyse. When he has proved the mercy
of our lord so great / he will eke exhort other yt they should repent and
amend. So our lord said to Peter: And thou converted sometime confirm thy
brethren. David should have perished / if he had committed him self to
Justice / but he in that part to weak called upon mercy, and therefore the
mercies of our lord he syngeth for ever. They that plede matters among men /
as often as their cause is in ieoperdy, if they may, they remove it in to an
other court / all though they be in dout whether they shall find there a more
egall judge. And truly may hap other while / he that appeleth may appele to his
damage. But to us most dear brethren / hit is a thing fer fer more sure /
not to strive with the justice of god / that is / not to cast up our heles
against the prick / but by and by to call upon his mercy. And truly in men's
iugementes / they say there is nothing surer / than i^ we may by some color
clean deny the crime / yt is laid against us: and the rhetoriciens teach the
most miserable state of a cause to be: which they cleape deprecacion / when
the defendant says / I have offended / forgive me. Here contrary wise there is
nothing surer for us than wylfully to aknowlege / what so ever we have
myswrought / and to beseech ye judge of mercy. Hither sith the goodness of god in
all holy scripture so louyngly provoke us / since the examples of so many
noble men exhort us hither / why should any be found / which despe^ryng of
him self had leauer wax old in sins? There is nothing i^ god / that is of
simple nature / that should strive with other, and yet if we behold those
things that chance us / a strife should seem to be between gods justice and
his mercy. Justice calls to punyshement / but mercy as saynth James says,
leapeth up against judgment as a conqueror. Who did ever cry: Jesus have
mercy: but by and by he opteined mercy? The Cananee cries: Good lord have
mercy / and her daughter is made holle: Every sinner eke should cry: Good
lord have mercy / and his soul shall be healed. He the blind beggar cries: O
son of David have mercy / and his cloak cast away he received his sight. Let us
eke cry: Jesus the son of god have mercy on us / let us cry strongely and
co^sta^tly even amydmo^ge the hourlynge multitudes of ill imaginacions / and he
of this worldly beggars shall make us enheritours of the heavenly kingdom. Who
so ever seeks co^modites of this life, is bly^d, is a beggar, and i^ a patched
cloak beggeth a half penny of the people. They yt seek to get a kingdom / yea
though they seem to go about a great thing / they do no^hyng else but wretchedly
beg a halfpenny of a multitude. They yt hunte for honors / and dignites / be
they never so great / they cry to ye people / Take pite, give an halfepeny.
But if any wylerie: Jesus lord have mercy / he is ready to give us him self.
Our lord tarieth / he calls y^ to him / art not unhappy but if you ru^ne? why
tariest in thine unhappy clothes? The alter of mercy is open / and thou
tournest thy self to the bonds o^ madness. The sainctuary of goddis mercy is
opened / and thou fliest in to the hurlepyt of unhappy despeyre. Thy savior
recheth the his hand / and thou turnest away thy face. Heaven is open unto the
/ and thou ru^nest down heedlynge in to hell. The lap of goddis goodness is
hold open to the / and thou fliest to the unhappy halter. The thief on the
cross hereth / This day thou shalt be with me in paradise / and thou gyueste
and byndest thy self to hell. But now it is time to fulfill that I lastely
promised / by what means the mercy of god may be soonest got. For of prayers /
weeping / fasting / wearing of hear / and ashes / yt is of a contrite heart /
is now spoken here and there through all the sermon. And truly these things
opteyne mercy of god: But well doing to our neighbor wresteth it out / if I
may so say. Such as every man will have god be to him / let him show him
self such to his neighbor. The greeks proverb says: Favor gets
favor. But with us mercy gets mercy. Luce.vj. Give, and to you shall be
given: Forgive / and ye shall be forgyue^: And by what measure ye have met to
your neighbor / by the same god shall met to you. And I call mercy or pite /
not only when vengeance is forgyuen / or need of our neighbur eased, but what
so ever good deed is done to our brother with a good my^de. He that teaches
him that erreth / that corrects the misdoer / and other while he that with
strokes chastifeth one synnyng, if he do it with a christian affection, he does
the warke of mercy upon his neighbor, he that exhorts them y^ shrynke from
their good purpose / that comfort the woeful / that bring the despeyred / in to
good hope he is merciful toward his neighbor / and either he reco^pe^ceth or
provoke the mercy of god. And truly it is unsitting the mercy of Christiens
to be of little price and common. A paynym will give alms to a beggar / any man
will help his friend in ieoperdy, ye gentiles eke perdone some offenses. But
what our mercy ought to be ye gospel teaches: Be merciful / yt ye may be ye
children of your father / that is in heaven. If ye mercy of god toward us be of
ye common sort / mercy of ye common sort suffiseth us toward our neighbor. But
if he co^mande his son to shine on good and ill: and suffers so rich
hauiour of this world to be common to the well disposed and wicked / if we will
appear his true children / let us be weldoers / not only toward our friends,
kyns folk, and that well deserved it, but also toward strangers, ye to our
foes and yt yuell deserved it. If god for us idol worshippers / and children of
hell gave his only son, seems it a great thing if we again do good to our
ennemy, which is our brother, in that he is a reasonable creature? And if our
rightous lord for our sins offered up him self / in ye auter of ye trosse /
seems it a great thing / if we forgive our neygh^our the wrong he did to us?
How dare a sinner cry / Lord have mercy upon me / yt denies mercy to his
brother? Shall not he worthily here this of ye gospel: O naughty servant / I
have forgyue^ the al thy duty / ought not thou to have pite on thy fellow
se^uant with the? What good turn so^euer we do to our neighbor / our lord
suffers i^ to be ascribed unto him / when he has need of no man: and al be it
yt god has first bestowed it al on us most heapyngly / what good so ever to
our power we have bestowed or done to our brethren / yet as though he were
bound for our good deeds toward our neighbur, he promises to yield us again
good mesure / with much e^crease / full and well heaped vp^ Is it not good
mesure / wha^ for herboring a poor man our lord receives the in to the
kingdom of heaven? The best way to wax rich is to wax pore by such
liberalite. The wise men of this world will not suffer their money to rust in
their chestis / but they leave it with the bankers / that by usury they may get
more to it. They that will be rich o^ heavenly goods / they must have ado with
ye most liberal v^urer. We call them happy that be rich / and in the gospel
the merciful be called happy / because they shall opteyne mercy. He plays ye
usurer with our lord says he the wise Hebrew / that pitieth ye pour folk
and he shall quite him again. And the prophet says: Redeem thy sins with
alms deeds: because as the prince of thapostles says: Charity covers the
multitude of ^innes. Ye here th^xchange: but it is with a great luker. Like
wise he the mystical synger: Happy is that man that piteeth and le^deth.
Therefore with god he plays a point of usury / who so ever for the love of god
does his neighbor a good turn. Ye here the exchange / ye here the encreasyng
/ ye here the redemyng. Who so ever hurts his neyghbou^ / is in danger of him
that he harmed: Who so ever to his power helps his neighour / byndeth him
that he does the good turn to. Do not ask vengeance on him that offended the,
but make excha^ge with god: forgive thy neighbor a few and light offenses /
and god of covenant will forgive the al thy^. Desire no reward again of thy
neighbor / to whom thou dyddest a good turn / but ask it of god what so ever
thou disposest well / and he for goods transitory / will reward the
everlasting.

There be diverse sacrifices / with which god is pleased / spiritual hy^mes /
songs / prayers / watchinges / fastinges / homely raiment: but no manner
sacrifice is more effectual than mercy toward our brother. Go says our lord
/ and learn what it is: I will have mercy and not sacrifice. He da^pneth not
sacrifices / but he pferreth mercy above them al. The same yt our lord Jesus
wit safeth to teache us with his own mouth in ye gospel / he taught long before
by the mouth of Michee ye prophet. For wha^ our lord had rebuked the
i^uincible obstaclenes of ye people i^ yls / ye people being thoughtful by what
mean they might apease god / rightously provoked with so many cursed deeds /
says: What thing worthy may I offer to god? Shall I bow my knees to almighty
god? What should I offer to him sacrifices, and yerelyng calves? May he be
pleased with a thousand wethers / or many thousands of fat gottes? Shall I
give my first begotten son for mine offense / the fruit of my womb for ye
sin of my soul? Hitherto speaks ye people / vnderst^dynge that no sacrifice
could of man be offered to purge away sins / yea if above many thousa^de
wethers / he would offer up his first bogotte^ son / to him most dear, but
the prophet shows a more effectual sacrifice / where with by and by the a^ger
of god is apeased. O man / I will show y^ / what is good / and what our lord
would have of y^, thou must do judgment / and love mercy / and thoughtfully
walk with thy lord god. What is to do judgment? to hurt no man, what is to
love mercy / to do them good yt deserve it not. Paul thapostle more over
adds somewhat to ye preise of mercy. If I should says he / give my body to be
burned / and have no charity / it avails me nothing. Abraham profer^d a
great thing / that was ready to offer his only son in sacrafice, that he loved
specially but he profreth more / if any for ye love of god delivers his own
body to be burned. And yet charity is more acceptable than that sacrifice. And
what thing else is charity toward our neighbor but mercy? Therefore sithe all
we continually in all things need ye mercy of god / our study ought still to be
/ how one of us may mercifully help an other / and one with an other beary^g
ye burthe^s to gether, we may fulfill ye law of Christ / that rather requires
mercy than sacrifice / and wylleth us to redeem his mercy with mercy showed on
our neighbor. But as my mind excedyngly reioyseth wha^ I cast with my self,
how great ye mercy of our lord is toward us / and how ready for us he would it
should be, so an huge great sorrow perceth mine heart / as often as I behold
inwardly / how scant the mindy^g of mercy is among Christiens. If we were
truly merciful our liberalite would reche even to the Turks / we should cast
coals of fire upon their heedes, that they overcome by our goodness / at last
should come to ye fellowship of our religion. Now we Christie^s by wars,
roberies, theftes, oppressions, more cruelly grieve and vex Christiens / than
any wyld beast greueth the ennemy thereof. If thou behold the luker / what
other thing do we but one live by devouring an other / after the manner of
fyshes? Who is not ready for small avail to begyle his brother / whose need he
ought to succoure. Now by our brothers pouerte we go about to get our
aua^tage / our brother for fault of meat dies, ye more ieoperdy I se him in /
the derer I sell to him in that he needs. How vnlowly is our stately fiersenes
against our inferiors? how great is the rebellion of thinferiours against the
superiors / how feld or in no place is pure charity? All places be full of
braulinges, detractio^s, and backebitinges. And we not only quite a little wrong
with great vengeance / but wilfully harm them yt did us no hurt. And the mean
while we mind not / how great mercy our lord has poured on us: which he
will call again / except we pour it again on our neighbor that we
received. If ye seek says ye prophet / seek. If we seek the mercy of god / we
must seek it truly and with all our heart. Turn you and come. She turns her to
us, if we will turn to her. The mercy of god came to us / when the son of god
descended down in to earth: let us go to her again. Our most merciful lord
inclines him / that he may assoyle an aduoutrer / let us again lift up our
affection to him bowyng to us. The first grice is, to cast away sin. So
phisicions first purge the body / that after they may put in better iuces. So
thou sinner first cast out of the mind ill affections / that strive against
god: lechery / couettousnes / riot / pride / anger. When the co^tynuer in sin
besecheth the mercy of god / does he not as though an e^nemy armed / holding
his sword and bucler in his hand / would desire peace? He that asks
receives / he that seeks fyndeth: to him that knocks the door is opened. If
ye ask mercy / ask it truly: if ye seek, seek aryght: and if ye knock at the
door of mercy knock truly. Will ye have example of one truly askyng mercy? He
the prodigal child asks it aright / but yt was when he had left ye hogs /
and wha^ he was returned to his father. O father I have offended in heaven and
before the, make me as one of thy laborers. Now here ye publica^ / yt for the
conscience of his syns dare not lift up his eyes heue^ward / dare not come nere
ye auter / but sta^dy^g a far, he knocks on his breast and says: Lord have
mercy on me a sinner. He asks whose affections turned contrary / of a
dro^kerd is made sobre / of a rebaude chaste / of a glutto^ te^perate /of a
bribour beneficial / of a lewd speker a good sayer / of a disse^bler a plain
man / of a crabbishe a lowly man / of cruel merciful. He knocks y^ with
devout importunatnes i^ a manner co^pelleth ye mercy of god / never cessynge to
exercise warkes of mercy on his neighbor. Cry to our lord: have mercy: but
and thou wylt be herd / se that thou here him again. He crie^h in his members
/ the sick and nedy. Here it thou stop thyn ear / he will not herethe
again calling to him. He is refreshed in his pour folks / in them he
thrysteth / hungreth / sickeneth / and pyn^th: in them he is despised and
offe^ded^ But more unshamefastly says he to our lord: Have mercy upon me,
which only will not refreshe his brother / but also vexes him undeserved /
oppresses ye weak / betrayeth the innocent, spoyleth the pour / begyleth the
harmeles. Continuynge in those deeds / he calls on the mercy of our lord in
vein. If they that do not refr^she Christ i^ his me^bres / shall here: Go ye
cursed folks in to ye fire everlasting: What shall they here that revile /
^pyt at / mock / beat / punyshe / sklander / and slay Christ in his me^bres?
If I be not disceyued / there is a sentence among the mymes puplians / worthy
for a christen man: In gyuyng he received a benefit / yt gave him yt was worthy
to have it. Why styckest at it thou froward ponderer of an others dignite? He
gives to one worthy of it / yt gives to the member of Christ: he gives to
one worthy / yt gives to his brother. And so forth / he gives to one worthy /
who so ever for Jesus love gives to a pour creature. If thou seek wynnyng /
play the vsur^^ with him: if thou dread pain / thou have whereby thou may
redeem it. After sharp rebuke / what says our lord in ye gospel? Yet give
alms says he / and se all things be clean unto you. When ^^^pest of the sea
is ready to drenche the / thou styckest not to cast thy merchandise in to the sea (be hit never so precious) to save thy life: When the vengeance of god
hangs over the / does it grieve the to dispose a little money on thy
neighbor? What would you leave undone / if thy house were a fyre^ But what
burning is so dredefull as the anger of god? When his anger suddenly flameth up
/ wylt not use the remedy that is showed to quench hit^ What, wylt thou say?
Who shows hit? That very good man Sirach: Water says he / quenches flaming
fire / and alms deed withstandeth sins. Alms deed knows not bosting /
other wise she loses her name. They that give alms with a trumpe blowynge
before / they give not alms but bye glory. For conclusion alms before god is
when thy lift hand knows not what thy right hand does. Put says he / thy
treasure in the co^mandementes of god / and it shall profit the more tha^ gold:
close thy alms / in ye pour man's heart / and it shall deliver the from all
yuell. Thy treasure is never so sure buried or hid / as in the pour man's
heart. It is far better locked there in than in thy iron chestis. Forget that
thou have given: let not ye pour man know / if it may be / who is ye author of
the good deed. When thy need requires an intercessor / the alms shall not be
du^me / but shall opteyne of our lord / that thou yt dyddest succor thy
neighbor in any trouble / shall be delivered from all ill. Will ye here alms
deed speaking? Come ye blessed children of my father, for when I hu^gred / ye
gave me meat: When I thyrsted / ye gave me drink: when I was naked / ye
clothed me: when I wa^ted lodgyng / ye lodged me: wha^ I was sick / ye viseted
me: when I was in pri^on / ye came to me. They remember not their benefittes /
and say: O lord when did we se the wa^tynge those things / and succored the?
The other part reherseth their virtues / and they here: Go ye into everlasting
fire. Shall not alms deed tha^ be here a good spokes woman, that shall deliver
us from hell / that is from all mischief: and shall join us to our lord
fou^^aine of al goodness? What rests now most dear brethern^ / but that we
must beseech the mercy of our lord / to grant us that we may be merciful to
our neighbor / lest if we here let naught by his mercy / shall aftward reqre
it in vain / but the more we be provoked by mercy here / the more sharp we
shall find his judgment / Let mercy toward our brethren overcome in us
wordly affections / that in god mercy toward us may overcome judgment. So hit
shall come to pass / that we with greable minds to gether shall sing the
mercyes of our lord for ever / aknowlegynge his mercies above all his warkes.
To whom be preise and glory through all costis of the earth for ever more. Amen.
