The two faithful Friends.
The pleasant History of Alexander and Lodwicke, who were so like one another,
that none could know them asunder: wherein is declared how Lodwike married the
Princess of Hungaria in Alexanders name, and how each night he laid a naked
sword between him and the Princess, because he would not wrong his friend.

To the tune of Flying Fame.


THe Emperor of Germany,
a turney did Proclaim:
Where many Princes of renown,
resorted to the same,
Amongst the rest Prince Lodowike came
and Guido Prince of Spain;
Prince Alexander likewise came
great honors to obtain.
The Emperors promise was to give
to him that won the day,
His only daughter as his bride:
the Story thus does say;
The Champions entered the field,
with carriage stout and bold:
Lodowike of France, most manfully
whose Armor shined like gold.
Prince Alexander was the next
that entered in the field,
And like a champion stout and bold;
he did advance his shield:
The haughty Spaniard with the rest
his valor there did show,
But Alexander by his strength,
gave him the overthrow.
The valiant Prince of Hungary
brave Alexander he,
From all the champions in the field
he won the victory:
Thus he by valor did obtain
the Princess from them all,
But yet in Hungary she lived
that had his heart in thrall.


The Emperor his promise kept,
and to the Conqueror gave:
His only daughter for his wife
whom Lodwicke most did crave;
For love had so inflamed his thoughts
and set his heart on fire:
That for to gain the Princess love
it was his chief desire.
This Alexander was so like
to Lodwick Prince of France,
That he so lately had or thrown
by Fate and fortunes chance:
None could distinguish them aright
or know one from the other.
In shape stature and countenance;
as if they had bin brothers.
Which bread such love betwixt them both
as could not be diuorc't,
Yet fortunes frown, and fickle chance
Asunder them in forced:
Prince Alexander gave his friend
the Emperors daughter free,
Which he before had won in field:
by manly Chiualry.
The envious Spaniard being vexed
and tortured in his mind,
He and the devil devised how
to (...) these lovers kind:
He to the Emperor accused
the Princess of base Lust,
And (...) with lord for to maintain:
these accusations Just.
The second part. To the same tune.
PRince Lodwick being thus accused,
by Guydo Prince of Spain,
His friend Prince Alexander then
this combat did maintain:
And sent his friend Prince Lodwick straight
to Hungary with speed,
There in his room for to possess
the high Imperial weed.
Friend Lodwick, Alexander said,
go thou to Hungary,
Against the Spaniard I Will maintain
thy cause most manfully:
The King I understand is dead*
go then and in my place,
Possess the Crown and dignity,
and all the Royal grace.
That they will there bestow on thee,
let it not be denied;
His daughter likewise in my name
Make her thy wedded bride:
But by our friendship I entreat,
this kindness in thy hands:
That thou by no means vyolate
true constancies chaste bands.
Although thou wedde her as thy wife,
Yet know it is in my name,
Let her remain a virgin pure
I do request the same:
Because my heart she has in hold,
and love her as my life:
Away be gone thou know my mind
leave me to end this strife.
Prince Lodwike now is on his way,
and Alexander he,
By fortunes aid the Spaniard slew,
and set the Princes free:
Lodwike in Alexanders name
received in Hungary,
The Crown, and likewise in the Church
his wife received he.
But every night between them twain
his naked sword he would lay,
Such constant friendship at that time
his heart and thoughts did sway;
Prince Alexander came himself
then Lodwike took his leave,
Of Alexander his dear friend
which did him not deceive.
The Queen in heart was vexed sore
that she so long should lie,
With him that was her husband dear
and not Loves pastimes try:
Unto a Lord she made her moan,
and they both did agree:
To be revenged upon the King
and poisoned he should be.
The poison took not full effect
but brake forth on his face,
That he a leper did appear
and then in great disgrace:
They kicked and spurnd him from the court,
thus in most shameful manner,
He was compelled to beg for food
that lately lived in honor.
To Lodwiks Court he did repair
thus like a leper poor;
And for relief he did entreat
at his friend Lodwiks door*
A Ring he sent unto his friend,
who well the same did know;
And came in love to greet his friend
willing to ease his woe.
Quoth Alexander unto him,
kind friend there is no way
To ease my pain unless that thou
thy loving babes do slay:
What (...) but I will do for thee,
quoth Lodwike by and by,
To ease my friend of this great pain,
my pretty babes shall dye.
For which he to the cradle goes,
where they were fast asleep,
And with a knife he lets them blood
his promise for to keep;
And with their bloods he washed the sores
from Alexanders face,
Thus he like to a loyal friend
the path of Love did trace.
Thus Alexander being cleared,
of all his torturing pain,
Lodwike unto his Queen made known
how he his babes had slain
This news did grieve her at the heart,
but straight she runs to see:
Whether that it was so or no
it proved the contrary.
For both the babes she found alive,
as God would have it so,
Which did revive her drooping heart,
now joys exceedes all woe:
King Alexander being well
to Hungary he goes;
And Lodwike his beloved friend
to overthrow his foes.
The victory they soon obtained,
and took the Lord and Queen,
And doomed them to such cruel deaths
as yet had not been seen:
King Alexander again was Crowned,
by help of his good friend,
Their griefs to joys converted were,
their pleasures did transcend.
