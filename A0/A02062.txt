An answer to master Smyth servant to the kings most royal majesty. And
clerk of the Queen's graces counsel / though most unworthy.
Whether ye trolle in or else trolle out
ye trolle untruly / look better about.
WHere as of late two things ye parused
Concerning the treason of Thomas Crumwell
Undoubtedly both your wit and your sight were confused
Lackyng a medecyne / blyndnesse to expel
Put on your spectacles and mark it well
Than shall you se / and say / maugre your heart
That trolle in / has played a true subjects part
For where as trolle a way (as ye say) told troth
Declaring the offenses / wherein Crumwell offended
It was not the thing / wherewith troll in was wroth
For in that point / Troll in / Troll away commended
But this was the matter / wherefore they contended
Trolle away / under pretense of trollyng against treason
Practiced proud popery / as appears by reason.
And ye supporting the same / your pen runs at large
Boldly as blind bayerd / ye write in his defense
And in your myscheuous manner / ye lay falsely to my charge
Saying / who that craftily colors any others offense
Of lykelyhode in his own heart / has the same pretense
But here ye speak of lykelyhode / and so blyndly go by guess
your fondness is the folyssher / and my fault is the less.
An horse being nothing galled / of force ye may make to kycke
With spurryng and with prickinge / more than reason would require
But if the horse were lustye / coragious and also quycke
ye might be the first perchance / that might lie in the mire
As wise as ye / have been drowned in their own desire
Many a man / another mischefe / of malice will prepare
And yet him self the first / that is caught in the snare.
Because of making strife (ye say) ye will take neither part
But here ye break promise / for against all reason and right Ve illi per qem
scandalu^ uenit, Luce, xvij.

Speking with your mouth / that you think not with your heart
Against trolle in / ye take trolle awayes part / with all your might
Thus all things lightly that ye make / among them selves do fight
Wherefore whatsoever ye write or say / greatly it shall not skyll
For if ye speak any thing wisely / I think it be against your will.
But blyndly have ye sclaundred me / good master Thomas Smyth
Scraping together scriptures / your madness to maintain
Truly your rude rowsty reason / being so far from the pyth
Had need of such a cloak / to keep it from the rain
For all the world may perceive / how falsely ye forge and feign
Yet still you affirm your falshed / as though ye knew things presysely
Christ's blessyng on your heart / forsooth ye have done full wisely.
Ye rumble among the scryptures / as one that were half mad
Wrestyng and writhyng them / according to your own purpose
Facyonyng and framyng them / to your sayenges good and bad
Like as the holy Papystes / were wont to paynt their popysshe gloss
Do ye take the holy scripture to be like a shypmans hose?
Nay nay / although a shypmans hose / will serve all sorts of legs
yet Christ's holy scripture / will serve no rotten dregs.
Counsel with some tailor / when that ye write next
Take measure of diuinyte / before ye cut the facyon
So shall ye square your scryptures / and the better trym your text
And than shall men of lernyng / commend your operacyon
But how should he be connyng / that knows not his occupacyon
How should a cobbler cut a core / or a smyth taste good wine
Or how should you scarsely a clerk / be now a good deuyne?
What living man (except it were you) being in his right wits
Would write as ye have written / and all not worth a myte
I think it be some peuysshe pange / that comes over your heart by fyttes
Under the color of charity / to work your cruel spyte
If men would mark your madness / and behold your deuelyssh delight
Should se how ye wrest ye scriptures to your saye^g / not worth.ii. chippes
And join them all together / as just as Germans lyppes.
When ye have spytte your poison / and said even the worst ye can
Than come ye in with charity / wyllyng all strife to cease
But surely good master Smyth / ye speak like a merry man
Much like a comen pyke quarrel / that strife would increase
Continually cryeng in frayes / hold / keep the kings pease
But those be pretty peace makers / in deed for every day
That still bestow mo strokes / than they that began the fraye.
What wise man would not laugh / for to here you brag and boste
Of your name / your service / of your office and all this gere
Qui se laudat stercore coronabit,
As though ye were prymrose perelesse / and a ruler of the roste
By the declaryng whereof / ye think to put pore men in fere
But your braggyng and your bostyng / shall neither be here nor there
As long as I may indifferently / be suffered to use my pen
ye shall never be able to face me out / with a card of ten.
A wise man would have praised god / and than prayed for the king
The which of their great goodness / to your office did you call
And not to have bragged thereof / and than put it out in printyng
For ye stand not yet so sure / but it is possible ye may fall
And though your office be great / I trust your power be but small
Or else parchau^ce ye would quickly thurst a poor man among the thorns
But god almighty prouydeth well to send a shrewde cow short horns.
Christ preserve the kings most noble grace / and send him long life
Even Henry the eight (next under god) of this church / the head supreme
Christ preserve and keep queen Katheryn / his most lawful wife
Christ preserve Prince Edward / the very right heir of this realm
Christ still ensence their noble counsel / with the influence of heaven
Christ for his tender mercy / amend all thing that is a mys
Christ send master Smyth more charity / when his good pleasure is.
Amen.
W.G.
By me a poor man whose heart if ye knew
Would be the kings servant as feign as you.
