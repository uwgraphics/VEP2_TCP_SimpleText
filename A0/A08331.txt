The Northamptonshire Lover, or a pleasant Dialogue between a
Northamptonshire Gentleman and a Merchants daughter of London.
To the tune of Falero lero lo.

THou sweetest of complexion,
whose beauty does entice:
My heart lives in subjection,
My love did it surprise:
Let only this suffice,
thy virtues I do know,
Which makes me to love thee,
Fa lero lero lo.
Were thou not so regardlesse,
of my most kindly offer,
And Mayden-like rewardlesse,
would entertain my proffer,
M^ Fathers richest coffer,
on thee I would bestow,
For still me thinks I love thee:
Fa lero, lero lo.
Of all my Predecessors,
I am the only heir,
That ^ieth in North-hampton-shire,
that country rich and fair:
Yet how soere I fare,
my love shall not be stow:
Thy virtues makes me love thee,
Fa lero, lero lo.
My Father being deceased,
mark but my store of land,
Which were my love appeased,
should be at thy command:
Do not my love withstand,
and thou my state shall know:
Thy virtues makes me love thee,
Fa lero, lero lo.
Three hundred goodly Akers,
of fallow Land is mine,
With threescore five half Akers,
which next to them do join:
For roodes and part of fetches,
I have as many mo,
Yet thy virtues makes me love thee,
Fa lero, lero lo.
Unsowne does lie so much more,
from weeds and thistles clear:
Which cause shall be more fruitful,
is kept until next year:
Would thou embrace thy Dear,
all this thou should have too,
Thy virtues makes me love thee,
Fa lero, lero lo.
Full fifty head of goodly kine,
my father free does keep,
Three goodly teame of Horses,
and full three thousand sheep:
Beside his swine and poultrey,
then let not love be slow,
Thy virtues makes me love thee,
Fa lero, lero lo.
His tenements are many,
built strong of lime and stone,
In North-hampton stands six,
my father calls his own:
Then let thy love be shown,
to him that wooes thee so,
Thy virtues makes me love thee,
Fa lero, lero lo,
What is it then does cause me,
of thee to be rejected,
My body has by beauteous maids,
been oftentimes affected:
Yet I all love rejected,
till thee I once did know:
Thy virtues makes me love thee,
Fa lero, lero lo.
Dear sweet regard my wounded heart,
struck by the God of love ^
Which until I obtain thee,
I know will nere remove:
Then grant me love for love,
on me thy love bestow:
For thy virtues makes me love thee,
Fa lero, lero lo.
Fond man leave off thy wooing,
for I thy love do shun,
Do think a Merchants daughter,
by words so soon is won:
Maids have been often undone,
by men's most flattering show,
Men's vices makes me hate thee,
To love I cry no no.
Men friendly seem to woo us,
when false they are in heart,
Intending to undo us,
and so from us to part:
Would all had their deserts,
that prove to maidens so,
Men's vices makes me hate thee,
To love I cry no, no.
The Second part, To the same tune.

FOr all thy fathers riches,
I do not wey a straw:
Young heirs often spend their coffers,
in riot, pride, and law.
Since first thy face I saw,
my love to thee was slow:
Men's vices makes me hate thee,
To love I cry no, no.
My father is as rich at Sea,
as thine is on the land,
Three goodly ships with Merchandise
do float at his command:
On wealth I do not stand,
enough does need no mo,
Men's vices makes me hate thee,
To love I cry no, no.
Besides within the City here,
full plainly may be found:
His Shop and full stuffed Warehouses
worth many a hundred pound.
Which does to me redound,
but yet I wish not so,
Men's vices makes me hate thee,
To love I cry no, no.
Uariety of Gallants,
make show of love to me.
Who of me shall be slighted,
just as I now slight thee:
My dowry shall procure a man,
whom firm in mind I know,
But yet my love against all shall stand
To love I cry no, no.
You men in minds are fickle,
ye love but by the hour,
A maid may find a young man kind,
who instantly will lower,
In all things men untrue do prove,
in promise they are slow:
Therefore I Will bid adue to love,
And still will cry no, no.
But if I chance to match wi^h man
North-hamptonshire I Will choose:
Because of mind those men are kind,
the rest I will refuse.
North-hamtonshire to London,
was helper in her woe,
Which is the cause I love them,
Fa lero, lero lo.
Which when this lusty gallant heard
he seemd away to part:
Pretending thereon for to try,
the temper of her heart.
For whether tongue and mind agreed
by this he thought to know,
And yet in heart he loved her.
Fa lero, lero lo.
The Damsel this perceiving,
and noting his behavior:
Thought fit to entertain him,
possessed of all her favor:
Which he enjoyed with full consent.
so unto Church they go,
Where he espousd the maid he loved,
Fa lero, lero lo.
The fathers of these couple,
death took into his hands,
And they were full possessed,
of all their goods and lands:
They lived in prosperity,
may all young men do so.
Let men and Maids remember this,
love creepes wher't cannot go.
FINIS.
