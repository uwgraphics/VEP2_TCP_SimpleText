A dyaloge descrybyng the orygynall ground of these Lutheran faccyons, and many
of their abusys / compyled by sir wyllyam Barlow chanon.

To the reders.
Grace from god the father, and from our lord Jesus Christ, with the assystence
of the holy ghost.
WHere as I consider O christian reders, the danger of writing in ye peryllous
season of these latter days, largely depaynted by sait Paul even as it
pro^uyth now in deed / that certain persons depart from the faith, and give
head to dysceytfull spyrytys and deuelysh doctrine, through simulacio^ of falls
wordis / by whose meanys it is come so to pass, that a little fawte is not
only taken to the worste / but what so ever is well done, spoken, or wryte^,
is oftymys interpretyd amysse: no marvel though I so vnlernyd greatly abash to
put my self in ieoperdy of these swords wolfys and pyty^^s soul murderers,
which byte with their teeth and prech peace with their tongys / seeing that
famous clerkys of pregnante wyttys, of excele^t erudycyon, and synguler vertew,
have so little auayled i writing against them: not that these new techers fo
ancient heresies, and late auctours of old inueterat syfmys, arso profound in
knowledge of scryptures, either so inuyct of reasonable argume^tys, that they
have not been many tymys overcome as theye be daily va^queshyd / but because of
their shameless pertynacyte, where as theye be prostrate and lie grouelyng
upon ye ground, dystytute of reasone, void of good argumentys, and without
any fence of treuth / the^ strogle they to woorey men with wordys of conuycyous
malediccyons and sedycyous slau^ders, not afraid to dyspyce their souerayns
wythowte regard of their power, contemnynge all auctoryte contrary to the
doctrine of saint Peter, sayng: Be ye subgect to every man for our lordys sake
/ unto ye king as chief, and unto the governors as to those that are sent by
him for the ponyshment of the evil and reward of the well doers: for so is ye
will of god, that doing well ye may stopp the mouthys of folysh and ignorant
people, as free and not as a color having the lybertye of malice, but as ye
seruau^tys of god. Notwythstandyng in their solemn prefacyes and payntyd
tytles of their errous / they begin with dulcet salutacyo^s of glosyng
perswasyons, under the pretense of a godly zele / oftymes repetyng the word of
god, the gospel of Christ, his promyses, his charity etc. whereby they would
persuade to rude people / that what so ever theye write or teache, are the same
thyngys be the never so contrary / even as the comen sort of ungracious
wretchys do, which in t^lling lies and report of slau^ders, will call into
their record the troth of god, the holy euangelystys, the blessed
sacrame^tys, and all the mysteries of our be fleef: not for any faythefull
reverence toward them / but to the^tent that they might be better believed in
their falsehod.

Many thyngys which are put forth under the title of ye word of god, is not
his trewword in effect / no more tha^ all those which bear the name of christian
men, be not all christian men in troth and deed. Man lyuyth not only by bread
says scripture, but in every word yt comyth owte of the mouth of god. Mark
here christian reders the word that procedyth ow^ of ye mouth of god / to yt
which we ought another to add, nor to take any thing away from yt. Arrius,
Pelagius, Manicheus with such other, whom the more part of these sec^ys
confess to be heretykys / dylygentely laid the word of god for them, but not
owte of his mouth: for they applied it by wrong interpretacyons to the setting
forth of their heresies, and not to ye glory of god. Saint Paul helyd syk
folk / and drove the wykked spyrytys from them that were possessyd through
goddys word in the name of Jesus / whose doing ye chylderne of Sceue assayd to
cou^terfete with like wordys: to who^ the spyryte answered: I know Jesus and
Paul, but what ar ye? and so grievously assawtyng them he prevailed against
their presumpsyon. The aged prophet of Bethell, by whose dysceyte the man of
god sent out of Judah to Ieroboham was slain: allegyd ye word of god. The
false prophet Sedechias with his company.iiii. C. in number, falsely promised
king Achab vyctory to his destruccyon / layeng for their auctoryte the word of
god. Ananias resysted the true prophet Ieremye / prophesyeng to the captyue
Israhelytys liberty and sone delyuerance of their bondage, causyng, them to
trust in his leasyng, which he said was the word of god. And generally all
other false prophetys bostyd them selfys to be sent of god, and ca^ to preche
his troth, whom he never did send / as he wytnessyth with his own mouth in
diverse placys of the b^ble. ^Furthermore all such as occupy inchau^tmentis,
coniurers, and wytches, in their busynes with many cerymonies rehearse the word
of god Also our savior christ says that many shall come in his name sayng: I
am Christ, and they shall dysceue many / but how? surely in perswadynge yt
their doctrine is goddys word / and that they be his messengers, his anoyntyd
sonnys and special prophets. So did Simon Magus delude the people of Samary,
affermynge yt he was Christ. Like wise Machomete named him self the great
prophet of god. And all othere heretykys comenly in fortefyenge their
abhomynable heresies, allege the word of god and euangelyke veryte, according
as Martyn Luther with the hole rabble of his adhere^tes do daily practyse. But
what avails yt to recyte the word of god, if we interpret yt by a false
peruertyd sense? what advantage is yt to say Lord Lord, and do not as he
comau^dyth us? He yt says I know god, and observes not his commaundementys
/ is a liar, and there is no trothe in him. The pharyseys dyicyples said to
Christ: Master we know yt thou art a true speaker, and thou teach ye way
of god in trothe / yet thought they nothing so in their hearts* what thing is
more easy for these new teachers, tha^ in blasynge their auctoryte / to say
that their doctrine is the true word of god, and that they have his spyryte:
where as they admit no interpretacion of scripture but their own / in so much
that they reiecte part of the bible because yt seruyth not to their purpose.
Concerning ye determynacyo^ of general councellys, and auctoryte of auncyente
doctors of the church / they utterly contemn, except in few things whereowt
they gather sente^cyes / which fals^ly deprauyd and othere while changed clean
contrary to the auctoures intent / they make to serve in colourynge their
heresye. How shall we then know whether they be the right preachers, and
their doctrine the word of god or no? Trewly Christ geuyth us a rule
infallyble, saying: By their fruits ye shall know them. A good tree can
bring forth no evil fruit, nor a badde tree cane bring forth no good
fruit. And they which here the word of god with an ernest and good heart / they
hold yt fast, bringing forth fruit in pacyence^ Also saint James
descrybynge the expedyent condycyon of cryste^ prechers and heavenly lernyng
says: who that among you is wise endued with coming / let him show his
good works out of a good conuersacio^ with softenes of wisdom. If ye have
sower hatred and varyaunce among you in your heart / will not ye rejoice and
belyers against the trothe? for this is not the wisdom coming from above, but
yerthly, bestyall and deuelysh. where as is enmyte and contencyon / there is
inco^stancy and all noughty doing. The wisdom yt desce^dyth from god is furst
chaste, and so peasable / mylde, treatable, full of mercy and good frutys,
without any mysdemyng or dyssymulacyon. Now to compare these frutys unto the
actys of these Lutheran faccyons / ye shall find a far difference. wherefore
seeing that by long experyence I have perc^yuyd the fassion, manner, and order
of all statys among the^, and was no small while conuersaunt with those which
are of highest reputacio^, both for their sobernes of life and fame of
lyterature: I have thought yt necessary for the discharge of my conscience, and
informacyon of other / plainly to show the veryte as I have known, without
hatred of them or favor of any other persons: which to perform I have here
co^pylyd this little process following, under the form of a brefe dyaloge.
wherein though ye shall read some thyngys so strange for the enormities of
them, ye diverse men, namely the favorers of these sectys, will judge them
unlikely of truth, and half impossyble to be vsyd among reasonable people
endued with any wisdom or lerni^g: yet are they matter in deed, according as
ye shall see vnfaynydly declared. And be ye full assured that I rehearse not by
a great part all the abusys manyfestly known by the^ / nor so many as I coud
show: which god wyllyng hereafter in process of time may be disclosed more
largely. A great occasyon why yt many be so fervent in fauouryng this Lutherane
doctrine / is the vayn praises of much people coming from th^n^e, reporting
that there is so good order, such charytable lyberalyte, and euangelyke
co^uersacyon, which is all to gether false. And diverse of such tydyng cariers,
lest they might seem ignorante in a few thyngys / they frame them selfys
wythowt shame to lie in many. It is hard for a renegate friar, a faythelesse
apostata, a forlorn copeman, a marchau^tys pre^tyce, or a^ embassatours
hostler / having little lernyng, less dyscressyon, small devotion, and scant a
curtesy of wisdom: to make true report in such matters. And yet ar there of
them which make the^ selfys full besy / and ar as ready to tell that they know
not as yt that they know according as they feel their affeccyons desposyd whom
they covet to please: by which means they attain hye co^mendacio^s, made
much of, and ar called pretty wise me^ and proper persons, with many godd
blessyngys upon their hartys. Such is the madness of ye world and folysh
appetytys of people, p^ferryng their corrupt affeccyons before right judgment
and testymony of their conscience. Trothe yt is that ye Germayns of old
antiquite, have deserved special lawde for their playnes in word and deed void
of dyssymulacyon, and for their homely famylyaryte without accepcio^ of persons
/ in which unto this day they excel other nacyo^s: whereof ye original cause
many falsely do ascrybe to this Lutheran doctrine, being dowtlesse meruelously
decayed through yt / so ye true playnesse was not wont to be so scace there
among sca^t good livers, as frawdis begin now to be plenty among their new
gospellers. wherefore (christian reders) I exhort you all percyalyte set a
part / to fyx your self upon the living word of god which may save your
sowlys, and walk dyrectly after yt / bowyng another on the one side nor on the
other. I mean not that fleshly word nor their gospel which say: ye have no fre
will, your good deedys shall not save you, nor youryll dedys shall not da^pne
you, ye sacramentys of ye chirch be nothing of necessite, ye need not to be
confessyd to a priest, ye are not bownde to obey the laws of ye church etc.
but that true word of god and very gospel of our savior Christ / of whose
furste sermon the antetheme was this: Do ye penance for ye kingdom of god is
at hand. And at his last farewell from his dyscyples he a^^ermyd ye same,
saying yt in his name yt behooved penance to be preachyd in remyssyon of
sins: which manner of preaching the apostles after his assencyon obseruyd,
co^tynually exhortyng the people unto penance and to the dread of god / which
is the beginning of wisdom, the inseparable companyon of penance, and
necessary introduccyon to faith. The word of god bryngyth forth penance /
according as we read in the acts of thapostles.^. yt at saint Peter's preching
they were compuncte in heart, and o^red them self to penance. This unfeigned
penance leadyth men to faith, and is the e^tre to the gospel. Mar. 1. Do ye
penance says Christ, and believe ye gospel. which belefe can not be attained
without the dread of god. For it is the fulness of science / whereby we come
down first to know oureself / and so asce^d to ye knowledge of god by his word,
whereout through heryng faith takes her effect. The majesty of goddis word
is of that nature / to prostrate the presumpcyon of man's wisdom and
affyau^ce in our selfs, exylyng thaffeccio^s of carnal liberte, and moving us
with a redynes of mind and certain trymblyng fere to say with saint Paul,
Lord what wyllest thou us to do? This reverent dread had Cornelius Centurio,
wha^ the joyful messenger of god apperede unto him / to who^ with fere abashed
he sa^d: Lord who art thou? in whose commendacyon it is written there, Actorum.
10. that he was a devout man and dredyng god. Likewise Iuce. 3. the shepeherdys
when ye angel of gladtydynges appeared to them, and ye brightness of god shone
round about the^: having this dread were astonyed in them selfys / to who^ the
angel spoke: Be not afraid / ^o I show you great joy yt shall be to all
people, for there is borne a sauyoure which is Christ our lord. In Exodo it is
written. 14. the people feared god, and so be leued him and his servant Moses.
And they yt dread god says the wyseman / shall not be unfaithful to his
word. Also saint Johan reherseth in his Apocalypse sayng: I saw an angel
fleyng by the myddys of heaven, having ye everlasting gospel / that he should
preche to the dwellers upon yerthe, and to every nacyon, and trybe, and tongue,
and people / sayng with a great voice: Fear ye god. But now comith the angel
of Satan with his idle justify cacyons and vayn promyses / clean contrary
perswadyng yt we need no workis of penance nor satysfaccyon for our sins,
sith Christ has satysfied for us all ready / only to believe is ^ough,
wythdrawyng people from the godly dread. Howebeyt lest his dysceyt should be
easily perceived: he transfygureth him self in to a true angellys lyknes /
sometime techyng virtuous manners, brotherly charytie, thexample of Crystes
actys and our needful acco^plyshment of the^ / wherein he would seem to profit
a few, to theintent he might begyle many. And diverse of his dyscyples
cou^terfeyting the apostles fassyon: otherwhyles allege scryptures in their
right sencyes, with ye same deuowte synceryte that Sathane him self did in
temptynge Christ when he said to him: God has commanded his angellys etc.
which was ye very scripture truly recyted all though to a wrong purpose. But
where as he in his own person cowld not overcome Christ our head: he ceassyth
not to supplant us his christian members by his false dyscyples / and is like
still to prevail (our merytes deserving ye wrath of god) except he of his
infynyte goodness and gracyous pity, vouchsafe to reconcyle us again unto his
favor and be our protector: whose mercy is ye only stay that we be not all
consumyd. Therefore let us draw nere with confidence to the throne of grace /
yt we may get mercy and find grace to help us at need / contynually having
in our remembrance the voice of the angel saying: Fere ye god / and give him
honor, for the hour of judgment comes. And worship ye him that made
heaven and yerth, the sea, and fountayns of waters / to whom be p^ayse for ever
wythowte end.

Amen.
Fare ye well.
Nycholas. wyssyam. NOw welcome good brother from parties of beyond the sea.
We have sore longyd for your safe return / hoping to here some news from
our euangelyke brotherne of Germany, and in what manner the gospel does
prosper there and go forward.


W. Sir I thank you for your welcomynge. How beyt concerning your desire, to
be certefyed of them who^ ye call eua^gelyke brothern: I assure you vnfaynyngly
that I like their manner every day worse and worse.


N. What have ye so suddenly changed your mind, and begin now to fall from
the gospel forsakyng goddys word?


W. Truly I have changed my mind from errors and wrong oppynyo^s / but never
entendyng to renye goddys word or Crystes gospel: whereof as far as I
ca^perceyue they be destitute and much wide.


N. To prove yt it were impossible / seeing ye cannot deny but that they have
Crystes gospel in their vulgar speech ipre^ted fre for every body to look
upon / with co^tynuall exercise of euangelyk preaching of goddys word.


W. In very deed they have the exterior letter, with some outward apparaunce
of zele toward it. But for all that as towchyng an euangelyke life or a
christian co^uersacyon, with faithful frutys behouable to ye same: they be never
a deal nerer in effect than were the Jews, which would have made Christ
their king / not for any sincere love that they had to follow him in virtuous
living* or for reverence of his godly word / but only in that they thought he
would have satis^^ed their carnal appetitys and sedycious affeccyons: whereof to
be auctour he was afterward wrongfully suspect / eue^ as we see now adays his
gospel evil spoken upon through the slaunderouse behaueoure and wykked
demeanoure of the^, whom in contempt of good people ye call eua^gelyke and
cryste^ brothern / auauncing them selfys to be only the true folowers and
obseruers of Crystes gospel / where as their living manyfestely repugneth. So
yt after my judgment the chief captayns of them may be lykened to Theudas and
Judas: (...). 5 which under a color of Mess^as coming the very savior and
redemer from all bondage / whose o^yce wrongfully vsurpyng by false promyses of
lybert^ ^/perverted much people of the Jews for to follow the^, to their utter
undoing and fynall destruccyon.


N. These sedycyouse persons to apply unto Martyn Luther and his folowers / is
both against ye trothe and witness of your own conscience if ye duly examyne
yt. For it is plain that this Theudas and Judas, of a presumptyous affection
and vii quyetnes of mind / without auctoryte of goddys word or preferrement
of his honor, sedycyously moved the people to follow the^ and not god: where
as Martyn Luther with such other euangelyke prechers, auaunce not
presumptuousely them selfs but god only / norther persuade the people to
follow them but Criste: whose gospel long season obscured by mennys
tradycyons, they labor to bring unto light / and to restore the captyued
conseyencys of ignorante folk unto the fredome of gods word / whereof myche
people now a days are nolesse desirous than the Jews were of their
delyueraunce of bodily captyuyte.


W. To answer you in this point, I dout nothing but this Teudas and Judas
pretended to the people (whom they finally dysceuyd) ye auctoryte of god / and
yt they were specially sent of him for their deliuerau^ce / showing some
colored appare^ce unto ye same: Like as Martyn Luther in ye beginning
pretended a meruelouse zele and tender affeccion toward the blind ignorance
of people for to reduce them unto ye clerenes of knowledge / showing such a
serue^^ spyryt, that he was iugged to be syngulerly chosen of god now in these
latter days, for a dew reformacion of the hole world.

But consider to what open myschefe his secret malygnyte brast forth at last
/ and how many thousandys by occasyo^ of his doctrine have peryshed and daily
peryshe both in body and soul: whereof to have a forther declaracyon if ye
will here me with pacye^ce / I shall so describe unto you ye fassyon of him and
of his adhere^tys, that ye may euyde^tly know yt they are no dyscyples of Christ
but of Antycryste, no true doctors but falls dysceyuers no apostles but
apostatas and patrons of peruersyte.


N. Now I beseech you the^ to proceed on your purpose, declaryng it at length:
and I shall gladly give you the herynge without interrupcyon / trustig verily
that all parcyalyte set a part, ye will show the very trothe according as ye
have perfitely known by experye^ce. And thus doing ye may setle many mennis
hartis at rest in this troublous season / so sore encombred with conte^cyons
and sundry oppynyons of learned men / that they ca^ not tell what party they
may best lene unto.


W. Sir furst of all I protest here, yt I entende to speak no forther than I
have perceived among them my self / or else perfytely e^formed by credable
persons, of whose certifycacio^ I ought to have no mystrust. wherefore for to go
unto my purpose, ye shall understand that this Martyne Luther chief captayn
of new heretykes, and bringer forth of old heresies / was a friar augustyne in
the cite of wyttenberge, under ye dominion of Frederyke duke of Saxony. which
duke opteyned a perdon from Rome for the byldi^g of a certain college there
within his own palace, whereof Martyn Luther was a great setter forward /
until the time that thither came a Iubelye from the pope, dysanullyng the dukes
perdon among other for a season: wherewith Martyn Luther not a little offended,
endeavored him self to preche against it. And sone after he putt forth in
prynt a treatise De indulgentiis, inueyng against the grant of perdons: how be
it so closely, yt he was supposed not to have condemned the auctoryte but only
ye abuse / which to say the trothe was to far out of frame in ye prouynce.
And also he took in hand to preche ye plain textes of scripture / dysclosynge
the blyndenes of the world and detectyng ye fautys of all estates both high
and low, spyrytuall and temporal / under such moderacyon yt he was taken for
a prophet of god among them / and grew in estymacyo^ of ye people daily more
and more. Not wythsta^dynge he pretended to take no part with any sect other
faccyon of heretics, as wicklyf, Hus, Berengarius, and such other whom he
utterly co^demnyd / dyssalowing the Boemes because they seperatyd the^ selftys
from the church of Rome / constantly affermyng the pope to be Crystys
vycarye. Thus he played ye woolfe in a la^bys skin a while secretly / till his
fruits gave euyde^ce and openly bewraid what he was in effect For shortly
after he alteryd his mind and reuokyd yt he had spoken before / wysshe^g all
his bookys that were empryntyd to be burnyd and utterly destroyed. Then begane
he stowtly to fortefy his feyned faith void of good workys / perswadyng
lybertye and assurau^ce of saluacyo^ / to ye defacynge of charytable deeds and
suppressyo^ of ye dread of god. Then preched he pleasante thyngys to his
audyence /, how no man was bownde to confess him un to a pressed ^other to
observe ye prescryppcyon of prelates about fastyngys and ^excepcio^ of meet
and drink and that no person nedyd to pain him self with works of
satysfaccyon whiles Christ had paid ynowgh for us all Also how co^stytucyo^es
of Popes and bysshoppys bind us nothing. Then all his sermones were against
ye cleargye / calling ye Pope Antychryste, and his folowers dyscyples of
Satha^s synagoge / in whose defyance he made a book intytled / de ^^ptuntate
Babisonica, full of conuycyous furyes and ragynge blasphemy against the blyssed
sacraments / preferrynge his own judgment above the holy doctoures of the
church. And where as he had wytnessyde before / that wicklyfe, Hus, Be
rengarius, and such other were heretics: than he said that they were godly
men and saints calling their conde^pners Antecrystes and lymmes of ye devil.
Furthermore to bring kings pryncyes and temporal governors in contempt of
their subgettes: he spared another by prechyng ne techynge to rail against the^
/ sometime preuely where he durst not discover his malice for fear of
dyspleasure / and sometime apertely there as he thought him self in no danger
of the^ on whom he rayled: as witness the letters of co^spyracye which he
craftily forged to destroy the duke George of Saxonye. *******************STAR
CRXN TILL END************** Also the outragyous treatise that he wrote against
the kings hyghenes both in latin and duch / so shameless and sedycyously, that
it is not only condemned of good men / but also abhorred of his own
adhere^tes. yet all this while he for bare the commons and vplandysh people /
and encouraged them to note other men's vices rather than to amend their own
fawtes / alleggyng often times unto them, tyrany of princes, oppressyo^ of the
clergy, with other manyfold myseries and wretched calamyties, which he said
they were wrongfully compelled to^ suffer. whereby within small process of
time they took such a stomach / that ^he dread of god and man set a side, they
arose up with open sedycyone in diverse pattyes of Germanye above the nombere
of an hundred thousand persons / in such a furious fasshyon, that every man
all most stood in fear of his life. wherefore M. Luther perceiving no small
ieoperdye toward hi^ through their insurreccyon / because the occasyon of yt
was laid to his charge as yt was in deed: immediately to shyft him self from
suspicion and dangerous displeasure of ye princes and great men / he wrote
hastily a book void of all Christian charity and natural compassion, against
the said comones or vplandyshe people / so extremely yt it would abhor an
hethe^ heart to here or read yt / enforcing every man without any respect of
pity, to kill and slay them as hounds: of whom were myserably slain in one
place and a another, above.iii. score thou sand persons / ye resydue being now
a life in far greater mysery and calamyte than ever they were before. After
this fell a dissencyo^ between M. Luther and Carolstadius about the sacrament
of the altar. For Carolstadius denies in it the bodily presence of Christ /
affyrmynge that when he spack these words: Hoc est corpus meum, he meant the^
of his own corporal body and not of the sacrament: where as M. Luther
holds the contrary / all beyt he began to fall from yt as his own
writing testifies, had he not ben ^ue^tyd by this Carolstadius / whom the
wicked arrogau^cy of his stomach could not suffer to be auctour of so hye an
heresy, whereof he couetyd him self to have been father. This variaunce
endurynge betwyxe them: diverse forsook M. Luther and leanyd to Carolstadius
side / and many malicious letters fraudule^tly forged were conueyde from the
one to the other with calu^nyous prechynges / ye and when they met to gether,
more ready with fystes than with pacye^t arguments to try their cause had they
not been sonderyd. Not wythstange through favor of the duke and other
valyau^te friends / M. Luther so ^uayled against him that he was excomunycate:
and being a man of ancient age, an old priest newly married, and some time
archedeaken of wytten berge / was feign to leave his young wife and avoid the
domynyon of Saxony. After ye he had wandered thourough diverse cities and towns
swadynge his opinion with odious report / to ye mynysshyng of M. Luthers fame:
at last he ca^ to Scyrich in Swytzerlande / where he found one according to
his execrable appetyte, named Swynglyus, which was there an excedyng setter
forth of M. Luthers doctrine. To who^ as soon as he had disclosed his
detcstable heresye against the blessed sacrament, he gladly accepted him / and
in denyenge the corporal presence of Christ, agreed both in one / saving in
this point they dyffered: where as Carol stadius said that our saueour Christ
spekyng these words: hoc est corpus meu^, meaned his corporal presence there
sitting with his dysciples at the table and not in form of bread: Swinglius
affyrmed that they were not to be vnderstandyd lytterally, but by a figure of
interpretacyon / so that est was taken for significat: and these words of
Christ, this is my body / were as myche to say, as this sygnyfyeth my body.
Of this matter he wrote sundry epistles to diverse of his familyar friends,
gloryously reioycynge yt he had found out the long unknown trothe of so
high a mysterye: not by the occasyon of Carolstadius (as he bosted) but through
his own dilygent redynge of scripture, and specially of saint Augustyns works
/ who in very deed is clean contrary to his horrible heresye. Nevertheless many
of M. Luthers adherentes assentyd unto him / among whom the chief was
Oecola^padius: which being a seculer priest of.xl. years of age, entered ye
religyon of saint Brydgyttes order in ye province of Bauarye / and for heresies
that he had vttred both by prechynge and writing, sta^dyng in danger of the
Dukes attachiament / he ran away pryuely with a nonne of the place / who^
sone after he forsook, and gathym for refuge to a Lutheran prince named
Fraunces de Sychken, a noble personage by birth, but a cruel tyraunte of
behaueour, a great murderer, a comune spoyler of marchau^ts and a rouere of
high ways / which mayntenyd him and one Hutten a knight of the new gospel,
given holly to mischefe / till at the lest for fear of displeasure of other
princes he was driven to put the^ away. Oecolampadius came then to Basyle / and
there he found many favorers of M. Luthers faccyo^: by whose aid he was
promotyd to be curate of a paryshe church. where he handled his matters with
such clokyd hypocrisye, that he wa^n^ many men's hearts / craftily so wenge
sedicious disturbau^s betwy^e the temporalte and the spiritualtye / in such
wise that the hole cite was often times in parell of insurreccyon and in
danger to be destroyed. But though he approuyd the oppynyo^ o^ Swynglius with
preferrement above Carolstadius: yet conceived he another pryuate understanding
/ saying yt Ho^ est corpus meu^, o^ght thus to be interpreted: this is a
figure or a representacyon of my body / allegynge Tertul^^ane, Chrysostom and
saint Austen for his authorite, whom he vnderstandyth a mysse and recyteth
falsely / sometime addyng more to their words, sometime taking away from their
sente^cyes. In this space Martyn Luther wrote a conuycyous book against
Carolstadius / and he an answer to the same of like spyryte and semblable
charity / so yt Swinglius and his company whiles other men wondered at their
madness, laughed them both to scorn. Earolstadius perceiving yt he was not so
hyghly estemyd as he reckened to have been / also longing very sore for the
company of his young wife: at last he made means to be reco^cyled again to
Martyn Luther and his church, which was grau^tyd him upon condycyon that he
should revoke his opinion of ye sacrament / whereto he agreed albeit he held
not long to wche with them. But as soon as he had recoueryd his wife again, he
gat him out of ye way in to a vilage and there kept a comune tavern / besely
vttryng his old heresies, and daily contryuynge new. Thus in Germany much
unquietness encreasyd and trouble out of measure / with intolerable varyau^ce
between seculer people and the clergy: many dyffamous lybellys and slanderous
wrytynges every where dysperpled abroad. And where as was but one faccion
before, only of the Lutheranes: than spra^g there up another / which be called
Oecola^padianes or Swynglyanes / owte of who^ issued also ye third faccyo^
named Anabaptystes, co^teyning above.xl. sects of diverse heresies and sondery
opynyons


N. In good faith ye tell here a shrewde tale by them. And if it be true as
ye rehearse I like their manners a great deal worse than I did. But specially I
merueyle that they be divided in to so many faccyons and sondery sects seeing
they pretend to profess the only doctrine of Christ, which noryssheth no
such co^tencyous dyuersyte: for he is the god of peace and not of dyssencio^


W. I ensure you there be in Germany.iii.C. sects above ye number that I have
named, of whose varyable opynyons I cowlde partly make rehersall if I had
conuenyent oportunyte.


N. Now I pray you for the satysfyenge of my conscience and of diverse other
which perauenture have been dyscceyued and brought to errors, by the feigned
report of the^, which would dylate their heresies underneath the conlour of
virtuous living, boldly affyrmyng in reproach of our catholic believe yt
among them is perfyte peace, concord, true love and charity, freely admynystred
to every one in necessyte without respect of persons. But first I would yt ye
declared somewhat of the.iii. pri^cypall faccyo^s.


W. The first as I have showed you are called Lutheranes, because they follow
Luthers doctrine. The second like wise are called Oecolampadyanes or
Swynglyanes / and are as one with the Lutheranes in raylynge against the
cleargye, and in co^tempnyng the authoryte of the church, but in the sacrament
of the altar they be gretely repugnaunt: and so far at varyaunce / that they
have made large volumes full of owtragious furies one against another / in such
vncharytable manner that it excedith the blasphemous contencyons of all
heretykes and infideles that ever were before our days. ye their hateful
enemyte is so malycyous, that if any of the Oecolampadyanes resort among the
Lutheranes: they shall be exco^munycatyd as hethen persons, and find very small
charity, which they call love after the new interpretacyon. And in like manner
ye Lutheranes shall find as little favor among the Oecolampadyanes. The
third faccyo^ be called Anabaptists, because they are twyes chrystened / and
will admytte ^one as their faithful brothere^ except they be rebaptyzed
again. They suffer not their children to be chrystened until they be of
great age / and have many strange opynyons. They affirm that it is
impossyble for kings, princes, justices, and other governors of ye common
weal, to be chryste^ men. They obstynatly hold that yt is unlawful for a
judge to require any oath of a cryste^ man. They say that christen men ought
to make no prouysyon nor resistance agayns their enemies but freely suffer the^
to do their will. Also they show holy perfeccion outwardly / observing
vigyles, fastings, with contynuall redynge of scripture, redye to help their
nedy brotheren, vsyng their goods in comoue. And they disprayse much the
living of the Lutheranes and Oecolampadya^s / saying as I have hard them my
self report, that they be wors than the clergy / whom they call Papists, for
because they have the gospel in their mouths and frame their lives no thing
thereafter / showing none ame^dment of their lewd conuersacyo^, but co^tynue
still in vycyous excessys after the comone rate of mysbeleuers. And therefore
they be in grievous hatred and suffer much persecucyon of the other / as
excommunycacyon, exyle, enprysonement, and oftentimes cruel execucyo^ of
death: in so much that it is enacted throwgh out Suytzerland among ye
Oecolampadyaes, and in diverse other places / that who so ever is found of the
Anabaptystes faccyon / he shall be thrown quycke in to the water and there
drownyd.


N. I se well tha^ saying and doeng are not all one. For I am informed that
Martyn Luther has written extremely against the persecucyon of prelates /
affyrmynge yt to be against the spyryte of god to persecute or to put to
death for unbelief or errors / consyderyng that faith (as he does say) is a
gift of god / and no man may have yt of him self. Also because Christ never
compellyd any man to believe in him, co^mau^dynge the wedes to be suffered
among the corn until the heruest co^myth.


W. No fail he wrote so at the beginning / but afterward experience tawght
him the contrary. For if so be that he and ye Oecolampadyanes had permittyd
their clyentes to do what they lusted without any restraynte: they had been
quite out of auctorite ere this time a day. upon which consideracyon yt was
forfendyd in all cities and iurisdyccyones of ye Lutheranes / that no man should
bye or sell other resceyue, any book or treatise compyled by the
Oecolampadyanes. And they in like manner made acts to suppress ye Anabaptystes
/ fearyng left their sects should vaynquesshe their faccyon.


N. if ye Anabaptystes have so many sects as ye recyte, I pray you to
declare some of them.


W. At your instaunce I shall gladly. There be some which hold opinion that all
deuylles and da^nyd sowles shall be sauyd at the day of dome. Some of them
persuade that the serpent which dysceyued Eve was Christ. Some of the^ zraunt
to every man and woman two souls. Some affirm lecherye to be no sin, and ye
one may use a another man's wife without offense. Some take upon them to be
sooth sayers and prophets of wonderful things to come / and have prophesied
the day of judgment to be at hand: some with in three months, some with in
one month, some within vi. days. Some of the^ both men and women at their
congregacyones for a mysterye show them selfs naked, affyrmyng that they be in
the state of innocencye. Also some hold that no man ought to be punysshed or
suffere execucyon for any crime or trespace be yt never so horrible, whereof I
will show you an example done matter in deed. In Switzerland a little from saint
Gall at a place named Cella Abbatis; one of these anabaptystes slew his own
brother / and smote of his head. when he was demau^dyd why he did so, this was
his answer: It was the will of the father that I should do yt / and so he
escaped without punysshement. For though they be gredy i^reproui^g other me^nes
fawtes / making heinous exclamacyones against the^: yet ponder they full little
the correccyon of their own enormityes / calling them infyrmyteis and weakness
of ye flesh be they never so abhomynable


N. well yet me thinks by your saying here before, that many of them lead a
more co^me^dable life in face of ye world than the comone sort of ye
Lutheranes or Oecola^padianes,


W. ye verily unto the outward ostentacyon. But there comes greater
incouenyence by them which have such a shadow of holy living, than by the
other. And there is nothing more peryllous in seducynge the simple / than a
payntyd pretense of an holy life / where as they swerue ones from the right
faith and catholyke belefe. which is easy to be proved by euydent examples as
well of the old heretykes, as of our new captains of the most hye
heresies. And to show you the truth as I have expertely found, some I have
known so angelyke of co^uersacyon, yt I could have fou^^e in my heart to
commytte my soul holly in to their direccyon: whom afterward I have perfytely
perceived to be auctours of such detestable heresies /that it would make a
criste^ heart to tremble for to here the^onis named. And to tell you of one
among many / I was aquaynted with a certain person of the Oecolampadyans in
ye city of Argentyne, which led a life inculpable among his neighbors, and
was reputed of virtuous conuersacyon exercysynge him self contynually in
charytable works, and understood fresshly ye scryptures in his mother tongue,
for he was ignoran^t of latin. Afterward he fell in to so abominable heresye
/ that he denied openly the new testament, saying yt Christ was a falls
prophet, and all his apostles dysceuers, acceptyng no part of the old
testament but the v. books of Moses. The chief prechers and learned me^ of the
cite came unto him for to reform him by way of disputacyon, and to bring him
from his error / requyrynge him to show what ground of scripture or what
occasyo^ moved him to take so peryllous ^pynyon. To whom he answe^ed coldly
with soft words and ^emure countenance, how he would another dyspute nor argue
with them, saying that ^t was his belefe and was assurid of god with witness
of his conscience to be true. Upon this inco^tyne^te he was enprysoned and at
last brought before the lords of the town / which in like manner exhorted him
to revoke his heresies / manacynge him with fear of terryble death if he would
not change his erronyous mind. He answered that he was ready to suffer what so
ever death god had ordained him unto, and would another for fear nor for favor
go from his opinion. wherefore after a suffycyent delyberacyon seeing he would
turn by no means / sentens was given that he should be burnyd.


N. In good faith well worthy: but was he burnyd in deed?


W. No. For when he should have gone to the place of execucyon / according to
the vsaunce of the country he was first brought before the town house / and
there his artycles recyted. He was asked whether they were the very same which
he had affermyd before them. He answered ye. Howbeit now (he said) god has
opened my ignorance, and I aknowlege me slanderously to have erryd asking
you all forgyuenes. I believe perfytely that Jesus Christ is my savior, and am
ready in his faith to suffer this death prepared for me. The lords then where as
they had given sentence that he should have been burnid / for a more easy^eth
they assigned him to be be^edyd, whereof he thanked the^, and went toward the
place of justice / pacyently taking his death with great repentance.


N. This may be a good admonyssheme^t that men should not be so wauerynge in
faith / as to give credence in all things to any person for ye only pretense
of exteryoure holiness, in as much as the devil can transfygure him self in
to an angels likeness, and a falls peruerter take upon him ye office of a true
apostle. Moreover I consider by your co^munycacyon and plain experyence here
rehersyd / that if the froward sturdynes of unruly people were not restreyned
by laws, prohybycyo^s, and sharp punys^heme^tes / every comone weal would be
soon subuertyd, and the hole world come to naught.


W. As for that ye may take example natferrehens at ye countye of Emdone in
east Fryse land / where the earl ruler of the county fyrstle resceyuyng Martyn
Luthers doctrine, and afterward Oecolampadins opinion: suffryd his people to
read all manner of books, and to be of what soever sect or opynyo^ they would
without any restreynte. Shortly after one of their chief preachers which
had been a freer obserua^te, a man of subtyle learning and pleasant speech,
hyghly estemyd among the people: began to preach in open audyence against the
blyssed trynyte / saying that there was but one person, one god, and that our
sauyoure Christ was a creature as we are, a pure man, and not god but having
gods spyryte. This caused not a little dyscorde between the prechers and the
people / for many of ye cou^trye leanyd unto him, taking his part so strongly
that the earl was feign to banysshe him owte of his domynyon, all beit his
pestyferous sede remained styll^ The^ came thither doctor Baltazar, and after
him Carolstadius / bringing in the fac^yon of ye Anabaptists / to ye
augmenting of greater co^fusyo^. For where as some crystenyd their children,
their next neighbors would not / one condemnyng another with dedly hatred. The
mean season a certain skynner of Denmarcke in the dukdome of Holsacye, where
Martyn Luthers doctrine was only in strength / preached Oecolampadius opynyo^
with so crafty arguments, that Martynes feign began to decreace. wherefore
doctor Pomerane was sent from wyttenberge to dyspute against him / and in
conclusyon obtained the vyctory through parcyall favor (as some reportyd) of
ye duke and lords of the cyteys of Homburgh and Breame: which immedyatly
co^maundyd that no man should be so hardye to contrary or swerue from the
doctrine of Martyn Luther, under pain of banysshynge and other ^unysshement.
The^ two prechers of Breame were sent to Emdone to dyswade ye earl and his
people from Oecolampadius opinion, and from the confuse dyuersyte of other
sects / also to reduce them again unto Martyn Luthers ways. The earl with
his counsel at there perswasyons alyenatyd their minds from Oecolampadius /
streytely chargyng all those prechers which had susteynyd his faccyon, or any
other saving Martyn Luthers / to depart out of his country by a certain
day appointed. Then was it a wonder to se what murmuracyon, grudge, and rumor
of sedycyon was among the people / not without lykelyhed of falling together
by the ears and insurreccyon against their prince, had not he sought
prouyde^t means to pacyfye the^. This co^tynued no long space but letters
came from Argentyne, Basyle, zyricke, Bearne, and from many persons of notable
erudycyon after their estemyng, also from the prince of Hesse / aduertysynge ye
earl with seryous exhortacyon, to call home again ye prechers of
Oecolampadius faccyon / and reprehendyng his sodayn mutabylyte from their
institute, so apparent by manifest conjectures to prevail above ye other. At
whose importune requests and subtyle instygacyons, he changed yet again his
purpose, and gave the Oecolampadyane prechers lyce^s to return in to their
old places, and liberte to preach as they were before accustomed: co^maundyng
silence unto the other or else auoydaunce of his country. ^o thus may ye se
what varyable inconstau^cy and sondrye mutacious of condemnyd heresies has
ensued with euydent confusyo^, where as people be dyuided from the unity of ye
christen church, and contemn to walk after the wholesome decre^s of catholyke
fathers / wrestynge the right sense of scryptures unto their crooked
ymaginacyons. And specially where the bridle of sensualyte is set at large /
to ye sturdye frowardnes of sedieyous subjects, sometime by ye ^ffemynat
te^dernes of princes so neglige^tly regardid / yt afterward their fearful
rygour is scantable to redress it: which has been ye lamentable dekay of ye
Boemes, and is now the ruynous myschefe of the hye Almaynes / not unlikely to
be the desolacio^ of crystendome, if remedy be not found in season.


N. Saving your pacyence me thought ye declared here yt the La^dgraue of Hesse
is a favorer of Swinglius and Oecolampadius / who with his people as I
understand admytteth Martyne Luthers ways and none other.


W. I will not deny but he maynteneth still Martyn Luthers doctrine / all be
yt syns the dyspotacyon was before him, he has favored so greatly the opinion
of Oecolampadius and Swinglius, yt were it not as I deem for fear of
displeasynge his confederate cosyne the duke of Saxony, and frentyke
perturbacion of Martyn Luther / he would have sustained yt openly ere this
time. witness the glorious comendacyo^ unto their faces whiles they were
present / and synguler preferreme^t of the^ among his famylyer cou^sellers /
also his beneuolent lyberalyte at their departing with letters afterward
betwyxe the^ farsydfull of painted praises i^ their absence.


N. I beseech you when and under what manner was this dysputacion.


W. In the year of our lord.1528. the prince of Hesse in his chief cite of
Marburge caused there to be assembled Martine Luther Melancton, Oecola^padius,
Swynglius, Capito, Butzer with many other of ye most famous clerks of the
Lutheranes and Oecolampadyans (ye Anabaptystes only excludyd) where diverse
artycles were doutfully proponyd to ye number of.xv. which before time had
been dyscussyd and clerelye determined in general counselles of the universal
church. And when they had by long pro^cesse vnfrutefully dysputed about the
iustifycacion of faith without good work^: of baptyme, and other questyons upon
which they had written hole books: yet in ye end were they dryue^ to the old
determinacyo^ of the church, save les^e their wrytynges should seem in vain,
and their assemblynge to be idle / they found out some contrariety of so
slender importancye, that me^ may plainly judge in them, other inuyncyble
arrogance dysdaynynge to be reformed / or else obstynate malice seeking for
the nonis of impugn ye troth. ^oncernynge the sacrament of the altar wherein
rested ye princypall matter of their disputacyon / they greatly varyed and
could by no means agree. How beyt they concludyd attelast, that each part
holding them content with their be lefe / should depart in loving
frendshyppe, without any odyous writing from thence forth one against a
another.


N. whether of them obtained the vyctory?


W. They divided yt between them while they were present. But sone after
their departing, the Lutheranes ascribed it to Martyn Luther / and contrary
the Oecolampadyanes unto Oecolampadyus and Swynglyus.


N. use they such craftye conueyauns in promotyng their gospel?


W. ye hardely* and yt wythowt any shame wh^^ they be detected of ytt / (...)
sing me^ against their (...) to be fautours of their (...). Did not Nouioma^^^
gather certain sentencys out of Erasmus works, which falsely depraved he
coupled unto Martyn Luthers (...), and caused them to be imprynted: blasing
abroad that Erasmus and Luther were of one opinion / to the slanderous
hynderaunce of his ^fytable study? of whom after much other detraccyon / he
was not ashamed to crave subsedye in his beggarly indygence. Also Butzer played
a like pageante with Pomerane in translati^g his psalter out of latyne into the
almayn tongue. For where he aspyed any occasyo^ to treat of the blyssed
sacrament: he plucked out Pomeranes se^te^ces, and graffed in his own after no
compendyous fassyon: which as soon as they were enprynted / the fame noysed
over all yt Pomerane (unknowing to him) was one with the Oecolampadeans / which
afterward he apertely detestyd in diverse epystles, dyscoueryng the falsehod of
Butzer. Such suttyll dryftes I may tell you among them is daily not vnpractysed.


N. well, ye have here rehearsed many things against them / wherein if I and
such other would give crede^ce unto your saynges without surmyse of
per^cyalyte, we should sone turn our affection from their lernyng. But seeing ye
have been a favorer of the^, and paraduenture both spoken and written as
largely as the rankest of them all whom ye now call heretykes: feign would I
wit what mocyonyd you to take yt in hand so ernestly, and now to shyft your
self (...) yt so lyghtely.


W. To show you the trothe w^thowt dyssymulacyon how I was entyced unto their
faccy^ne, the very beginning was this. I had read certain treatyses of
Martyne Luther of the iustyfycacyon only by faith wythowt good deeds, / how
man had no fre will, how owre good warkes auaylled us nothing to be sauyd,
another our ill dedys should cause us to be damned, and many other artycles which
he falsely presumed to ground upon scripture^ Also I dylygently notyd how he
descrybed the abuses of popys, cardynallys, byshoppys, preestys and relygyous
persons / declarynge how the present dekay of the church, far dyffered from
the perfeccyon of the apostles and holy fathers at the furst begin ^yng: wherein
he made no lie though in other things he spared the truth. Furthermore
geuyng ear to the plesau^t rumors of his reformacyons, highly co^me^ded among
new fa^gled people: yt set mine heart so on fire, yt I coud not rest until I
had been there with the^. After that I had seen Martin Luther, Poinerane,
Melancton, and herd their prechynges / perceiving their order there in
Saxonye: I went in to hye Almayne unto the Oecolampadyanes / and remaynyng
there among them, was oftentimes conuersau^te with ye Anabaptists. In the
mean space I saw many wonderful alteracyons / as destroyeng of monasteryes,
pluckyng down of churches, casting out of images, breaking of aultares, and
caryeng the consecrate stones to the building of their bull warkes / also
maryages of prestes, monks, freres, nonnes, contempt of holy days, anul^ynge
of vygyles, fasting of the lent and embrynge days clean reiecte with other
laudable ordynaunces instytute by the church* ^ll places of scripture where
mencyon is made of Antichryst, falls prophets, masters of lies, and such other
/ they violently applied unto ye clergy / namynge them self crystene
brotherne, dyscyples of Christ and apostles of his gospel. In denyenge
purg^torye and auctoryte of ye pope, if they found in ancient a^ctours as much
as a corrupt title of a pystle so wnynge any thing to their purpose, all be it
the epistle self made hole against it: yet would they take it as the word of
god and sure reuelacyon of the spyryte. Contrary wise, if any alledgyd Austyn,
Hierome, Cypryane, or Chrysostom against them they would admytte their
sentencys for none auctoryte / saying they were men, and all men were liars.
In like manner concerning the sacrament of the aultare, where they read in
doctors of the spyrytuall eating and goostely being: they only acceptyd
that / and under the color thereof they would exclude the corporal eating
and bodily presence of Christ, to the establysshyng of their blasphemous
errors: which they shadowyd under the covert of hypocrysye and persuasyo^s of
peruertyd scryptures / in such wise that openly seeing I could not perceive
them, until it pleasyd god of his inestymable goodness to bring me out of the
land of darcknes and regyon of death, unto the clerenes of his knowledge and
living light of trothe. I can not excuse me but among the wicked I endeavored my
self to have done evil: but god so mercyfully preuentyd me / that it came to
small effect in* doing any harm. If I have been occasion of any man's fall
or cause of slander / I am sorye for yt and ask forgeuenes. Not wythstandynge
I never defendyd any opynyo^ obstynatly, another despised ye admonycyon of any
virtuous person: that I have erred was through ygnorance and of no malicious
pertynacyte. where ye be in perplexyte of credence geuyng unto my words / I a^
sure if that I spoke according to your appetyte, ye would put no dyffydence in
me whether I said ye veryte or lied: for yt is a plain case among the
favorers of these new sects / yt they will refuse no forged tales making a
wght for their side, be they never fo falls. And seeing ye believed me in error:
ye ought not to mystrust me now in my faithful re^ocacyon, volu^tarye and
not coattyd.


N. Cler^ly many men presuppose that other ye be deludyd by ye flatteryng
perswasyon of some worldly persons / or else utterly given in to a reprobate
mind / through gredy desire of yerthely promocyon and appetyte of idle living.


W. It is not in my power to stop ye wrong surmyse or mysse report against
me, now enemy unto their errors: whiles they abuse the same to ye friends of
their heresies: namely where as Sathane is loosed at large, and the lyenge
ghost the spyryte of untruth, walkyth at lyberty vn^^streynede. would god they
we^e as pr^st to remove ye (...) out of their own eyes / as they be pro^pt to
aspye a little mo^eis other me^ny^. They cry out sore upon the worldely
wisdom and carnal prudence of other persons, calling them tyran^ys and
mynysters of Ante^^yste / where as I ca^ perceive none more gredy of carnal
polycyes and fleshly aid of tyra^tys than they be. ^ere he never so cruel a
creature or myscheuous fend that is turnyd to their faccio^s / they re^ceyue
him for an euangelyke dys^y^^e, his malycyo^s mind nothing mynyshed, all
though perase his doing of myschef^ is ^estrayned by poue^tye or some other
miserable impedyment against his (...) any body speak ought against such
perverse penytetys / forth with they alege ye vnpytyous fie^ines of saint Paul
before his conuersyon, the sins of Mary Magdalene and her penance, also ye
example of Christ receyuyng publycanes and sinners, and how the angellys of
heaven joy more upon one penyte^t sinner etc. ^^ce. 15. I pray you what a
gostely patron was Hutte^ their furyous cha^pyon / a man not only
ouerwhelmyd with heresies, but also stuffed full of all unhappiness / whose
horrible end was according to his myscheuous life. For after that he had been
plaged with ye french pokkys, and was helyd of them seven sundry times: he
myserably dyed of them in an isle of Swicherla^d in extreme pouerte abhorred of
all people / his vile carcas eaten with sores, more stynkyng than any caryon /
so that uneath any body might abide the loathsome staunch of yt. More over I
beseech you with what christian spyryte did Fraunces of Syckhym defend the^, a
subuerter of peace, a burner of poor men's houses, and a troubler of all
Germany / upon whom the vengeance of god did light, and was suddenly slain in
a castle beside Crutzynacke to the infamy of his au^ceters and disherytau^ce
of his chyldern. I pass over the captayns of the vplandysh people and their
insurreccyon partly touched before.


N. ye wot well enough that Martyn Luther did write against them, condemnyng
their sedy cyous enterprise.


W. So did he in deed when yt was to late void of remedy. But as long as they
were in any lykly hod to prevail / he rather supported the^. what heavenly
wisdom did the monstrous fygures sygnyfy / where M. Luther was portred with a
book in his hand, and by him Hutten his protector in complete harnes holdyng a
drawn sword / with certain textis underneath prouokyng sedycyon. And as for
ydlenes / I saw no man more fawty in yt than them selfs: except ye account
that for profitable bysynes when they be another idle nor well occupied. Are
there not a great infynyte number among them, yt can say sharply to other
mennys chargys the commandment of god given to Adam: In sweet of thy face
thou shall ete thy bread / and dylygently repete ye laborous workyng of saint
Paul and other dyscyples of Christ, which live dylycately in ydlenes? And
suppose ye yt a man may not find many of them which have their susten tacyon
upon the spoil of churches, robbery of monestaryes, and extorcyon of innocent
people?


N. Though some of the^ be of such disposycion: yet ought not ye to condemn,
the ho^e number of the good for a small some of the yuell


W. why do ye then dispyse the universal church / because some of them be
naught*


N. Mary for because the more some of the yuell, surmountythe the less number
of the good.


W. And think you that yt may not be better verefyed among the new
gospellers, of yt which the best is stark naught? Notwythstandynge some I have
known of excellent lyterature, which for their sober co^uersacyon and
temperate living, if they had been as seryous in furtherynge the faith as
they were in setting forth of heresies / were worthy to be pillars of Crystes
church. But I ponder not so greatly the outward holiness of hypocrytes /
consyderyng that Arrius, Ma^iche us, Pellagius, and other execrable heretykes
even as they b^ equal with them in heresies / so were they not inferyours to
them in such hypocrysy. How many here in England within this.C. year have rydde
them selfys out of this mortal life with a desperate death hated both to god
and man / some drownyng the^ selfys, some cuttyng their own throtes, and many
hangyng them selfys / which in their life time have been reputed for well
dysposed, virtuous, and charytable folk above the common sort of crysten^
people / and peradventure some here in London of our old aquayntaunce. In
whom is fulfilled the^ sayng of Samuel: (...) marketh those things that (...)
open to the eye, but god con^^deryth the secretnes of ye hart^ to the
verefyenge of Crystys word in the gospel ^uce. 17^ That which is hyghly
auaunced of men / is abominable in the syghte of god. Nevertheless if ye go
to the uttermost: I coud appoint ye to many of the church, which accomplysh the
perfeccyo^ of living unfeignedly / whereof these men before said have but a bareyn
p^tenc^ or a domb symylytude. And as for the worst multitude of prestys,
monks, chanons, freers and other relygyous persons / I dare compare them
with the common sort generally of these new faccions / all though ye put a
part their faith and obedience to ye church, which I re^en no small matter.


N. So god help me then dare I give ye verdyte without any quest, that they be
stark naught all the meyny of them. And to begin furst of all at the freers
/ ye se what a rascal rabble ronneth abowte the country with bosomed sermons,
preaching fables and old wives tales instead of the word of god / which ar
ready matys to associate unthrifts in all myschefe, to the slander of christian
relygyon. And to speak of monks, chano^s, with other relygyous possessyoners /
I pray you what a gostely life lead they, given holly to s^outhfull ydlenes
and belly joy in etynge and drynkyng, wythowte study of scripture or
endeuerme^nte of any vertnouse exercise. They sing in their querys with as
great devotion, as hunters do at the halowyng of a fox / having delight in
yellyng of their voices and cryeng of organs, but no swetnes of spyrytuall
melody. Also seculer priests eue^ as bad as the best, shall ye not find them
at tauernes and dyshonest housys, drynkyng and gowsyng till they be as dronken
as apes / nothing abashed to swear blasphemous oaths and to use fylthy
co^munycacyon. And such as be curates having charge of men's sowles, are there
not many of the^ blynder that betles / destitute of necessary doctrine with
good living, whereby theye might edyfye their parysshons. It were to ^edyous
a process to rehearse their wrechydnes so far ou^ of order / which all the
world perceyueth and speaks against it, and yet can be none amendment.


W. If their wrecthidnes of living as ye say be manifest to all the world: it
shall not be so needful for you to declare any further thereof / as yt will be
expedyente for me to tell of these new gospellers, whose erronyous wyckednes is
known to very few here in this region. And surely to improve the universal
church as iuell, because many of them belewde: it were no less madness than to
set at naught the old testament, because ye more part of the childern of
Israel were evil / other to despise the gospel because all these new
faccio^s which falsely presume to be folowers of it, are heretics. Among who^
ye shall find ^enegate freers that have cast of their habytes and forsakyn
their relygyon, which have married wives and sone after escape away fro them,
leaving them in careful desolacyon / ye some one maryeng.ii. or.iii. wives in
diverse countries, whom they have dysceyuyde by craftye entycementys / making
them believe with their gorgeous apparayle that they ^e come of noble and rich
fre^des. And of these are there many which walk over sundry provinces, with
glosynge speech and sweet tales / spieng out unstable people yt will be
waueryng with every wind / and such a^ their stomachs ^erue them to contemn
fastings and prayers, desirous of carnal liberty, and can rail against the
clergy, caring for no iurisdicc^on / and when such unlawful menes fayll, give
them selfs to theft, robbing of churches and sedycyous dysturbaunce / whereby
some of them are promoted to the galows and shameful marterdome of felons.
Likewise apostata monks and ^hanons perverted unto their fectes, some bring
with the^ as much substance of the spoil of their places, that they purchase
therewith fair lands and yearly rentes. Also priests yt have made cheuesau^ce
of their benefices for.ii. or.iii.C. pounds / at whose coming it is world to
here how god is mangnyfyede for their delynerance from the tyranny (as they
call yt) of Antycryste / and what brotherly chere is made with fervent rejoice
i^ ye sustra^ce of Crystes cross, namelye if they have store of monye. And
sone after they are prouydyd of fair wives in safegarde of their chastyte, and
to augme^t their perfeccyo^ / whereby some of them chance to be so vexyd with
deuylles, that their gospel is not able to charm them / and are feign to
son away in lyberty of the lord, ere that their wives be made fast in ye
bonds of our lady.

Beside these, how many in Germany have annual pensi^ns of cities and towns
for term of life, bownde to no manner of serves / whose change of state is to
no renuyng of spiritual conuersacio^, but rather an vnsacyat lust of fleshly
fredome / euyde^tly tried by their vycyous behaueoure, idle living, and
dysguysed apparayll.


N. ye may speak many things for your pleasure / but ye know right well, ye
crystyn relygyon standyth not in owtwarde raymente, nor I ca^ not ^e but as
good a soull may be under a seculer wede, as in a relygyous vesture. The
strange dyuersyte of habytes is not commanded of god / another scripture
ascribes any holiness unto the^.


W. In good faith I speak of truth and not of pleasure For it is to me much
dyspleasure to se the^ such as I se the^ / not in their dysguysed clothi^g
only* full far unseemly for them, if they were either such as they were
before, or such as they now call them self / but over that in every kind of
all dysordered living: which ye let pass, as though I had fou^den no faut but
with their clothing. And against that ye seem to set at naught the habytes
and fassyons of religyouse people / calling them strange dyuersytees and
thingis naught worth, because they be not commanded of god, nor that scripture
ascrybeth no holiness in them. But as for strangnes of apparel, relygyouse men
use none. But their apparel was at the furst devised by such as they that now
hate relyg^o^, do not yet deny for holy blessed men. And now they cannot be
strange, when they contynew still every order his old fassyon, and that all
ye world has looked upon them, and among a thousand freers none go better
appareled then an other. But now unto the the other side, these that ro^ne away
from the^ unto these Lutherans / they go I say dysguysed strangely from that
theye were before, in gay ^agged cotes, and cut and scotched hosen, very
syghtely forsothe, but yet not very semely for such folk as they were and
should be. And this apparel change they daily, from fassyo^ to fassio^ every
day worse than other / their new fangled folly and their wa^ton pride never
co^t^^ nor satys^yede. And where ye set at naught all strange diuer syte of
habytes, in which ye mean I wot well not only religyouse men's apparel /
but also the garmentys worn in divine service, for therein I know your mind
of old: I say these gere were well ordered by good men, and not with out ye
good help of god. And ye can not find that they be dyssalowed of god, but
rather approuyd / in as much as he in ye old testament appointed unto ye
prestes and mynysters a several dystynccyo^ of apparayle from the comone
people, specially in their mynystracyo^s* Also yt appears by ye story of ye
prophet Heliseus, whom (...) children of Bethell mocky^ and wondered* upon / yt
he was not clothyd after their comen fassyon. And verily I hold it more
co^uenye^t for relygyouse persons to were ye habytes by their fore fathers
in^^ytute / than to be arrayed after the ruffyan inuencyon of many gospellers in
Germany.


N. All these ar but blind reasons of your own fantasy, nothing to the
purpose. The orygynall in ^^ytucyon of relygyous habytes began upon certain
consyderacyons. As thus: when holy fathers lived in wyldernes / they made their
garments after a fassyon that might best defend the sharp storms and ill
wethers. And some yt gave them selfys to bodily labor, contryued their clothes
to be shape^ in a most hansome manner to work in. Also some of them wyllyng to
exchew superfluytye of vesture / devised them habytes most apt for warmeth
and sparyng of clothe. But now these consyderacyo^s faylyng: to were the
habytes of them / and not to follow their example, me thinks yt mere
hypocrysye^^


W. Then may I say to you again after the same form of argumentacyo^. The
first inuentours of this new dysgysed apparayll, were hethen people /
unthriftiness, fools, and myslyuyng persons: now ye that be accounted good
christian people use the same, where as ye ought not follow their lewdenes /
therefore ye be etc. Notwythsta^ding I demanded ones of a certain co^panio^ of
these sectis which had been of a strayt relygyo^ before, why his garmentys were
now so sumptious, all to pou^ced with gardes and iaggys like a rutte^ of the
lance knyghtys. He answered to me that he did yt in co^tempte of hypocrysy.
why quothe I does not god hate pride the mother of hypocrisy, as well as
hypocrysy yt self? whereto he made no dyrect answer again / but in excusing
his fawt, he said yt god pryncypally accepted the mekenes of the heart and
inward christian manners / which I believe were so inward in him, yt seledome he
showed any of the^ outwardly.


N. I granted before yt there were some light persons. But what say you to
the prouisyon of pore people there, such as ar aged or impotent / and that
beggars be not suffered to crave at me^nes doors, nor to loyter ydelly as they
do here, but ar set a work. I tell you some men thynk if our sturdy monks,
chanons, and freers, labored for their living as we lay people do / yt it would
be a meryer world tha^ now is.


W. what a merry time it would be here in this land I am uncertain / but I am
sure that in Germany among these new faccyo^s, is yet but a sorry world and like
to be worse. ye say there be no loytryng begge^s, and that is true / for few or
none resorteth thydet becawse they can have none alms nor relefe / except
they will do i^tollerable service for so slender wages / yt if they be not of
sober diet, and long exercysed with labor, it is not possible for them to
away with yt. But what is their labor? mary pluckyng down of chyrches and
monasteryes, and buyldyng of bulwarks and wallys to instre^gth their to w^es
against them which covet to reform them. And here is a dowt to be mouyd / when
such busynes is endyd, how shall they be then set a work, considering that
in other occupacyons a fewer number than be all ready were able to suffyse yt
people / and so they find yt there all ready.


N. God will provide otherwise for them than man's ymagynacyon can c^ prehe^de.


W. If their ways lyked him I wot well he would. But sithe yt is no pleasure to
him to se them leave the faith and fall to heresies, pull down chyrches and
bylde up bulwarks against god in defense of their abomynable errours^ I
verily thynk that the wrath of god will work them vengeance, and send such
men much mysery, and abate their bulwarks to the ground / as he abated the
proud tow^^ of Babylon, when he confounded the byelders in to as many to^ges
as ye devil has co^fou^ded ye bylders of these bulwarks i^ to many sha^efull
sectis.


N. well I trust better. And which of us is begyled the end shall show. But
this here I say that as yet hitherto, where as ye spoke of their intolerable
labor: I a^ certefyed that they come from it as ioyously as it were from a
recreacion.


W. I blame them never a deal though they be glad when their task is at
an end.


N. Nay I mean when their hands be full of blaynes and blysters, with achynge
arms, their shulders black and blew by reason of heavy burdens: that then they
rejoice in suffrau^ce.


W. They yt so have certifyed you I pray you write unto the^ again, and pray
them to certefye you also how many works with an evil will for the only
lack of living / and how many run fro their work and rather choose to go
stele and be hanged to, rather the^ to come to so paynfull work again. And
by that time that they have certyfyed you of these two sortys: they shall I
warant you certefye of the third the other sort that are so glad of such
labor not fully so many as ye reke^ now. And yet I think verily that some
such are there to. And I would myche marvel else.


N. why so?


W. For I have known ere this where me^ have be^ sore hurt in frays / yt they
which have been sorest wounded have most rejoiced / not in his harms but in
the praysyngs of other.


N. who be they yt should praise so these labourynge folk.


W. Even such of their own sectys as will not labor the^ selfs / which ar
redyer to e^corage other me^ unto suffraunce of death for their opynyons, than
to ieoparde them self the least ^yppe of their ere. But now to your obieccyo^ /
that ye would prestys, monkys, and freers should labor as other temporal men
do: I hold it expedyent that many of them should be better occupied than they
are. How be it I have hard in Germany gre^ous complayntes and murmuracions of
hand crafty me^ and artyfycers against relygyous persons / which have made
them selfs worldly, and learned their occupacyons. For through their
augmentacyo^ / the proffytable gaynes of occupacyons was mynysshed / and the
wealth of their living decade, so that many were compellyd to seek adventures
in strange prouincys for defaut of work at home. Also I have known in the
cite of Colen and in other placys of the low country / that relygyous persons
in their cloisters fyndyng the^ selfs with labor of their hands, as
spynnyng, weyuyng, and making of lynnen cloth / have been haynous^y ^playned
upon to the lords and rulers / yt they took away the advantage and living
from the pore como^s and cytezens: wherefore they have been restrained from
taking of temporal peoples work.


N. By this reckoning seldom is a change for ye better. But yet how faye ye
to their prouysyon for poor impotent people?


W. After my mind they never went about an act that pretendyde a more godly
purpose / or a feruenter zele of charytable co^passyo^. which ordinance if yt
had a progress of co^tynuaunce as yt had a lykelyhode at the beginning: were
to be allowed and practysed of all christian nacyons. But every occasion wisely
po^deryd with dew cyrcu^stau^ces / it will make those yt be sage to stay at yt
and other like matters / taking auysement before, lest they e^terpryse further
the^ they be able to bring unto a lawdable end. It is ye very properte of
common people, namely of these Almayns / that, what, so ever they be persuaded
unto, agreeable to their affeccyons / they shall be ready in a sodeyn gyere to
accomplysh: regardyng another damage ne commodyte, though sone after they repent
them. And like as the people of Israhell brought the iewellys of their wives
and chyldern to the making of the golden calfe: so did they bring their
iewellys, bedys, rings, owtches, with money both gold and silver, to the common
hutches so haboundantly for this prouysyon / ye men dowted in some place
whyther they had poor folk suffycyent to consume so exceeding heapys of
riches. But this dout was sone made a plain case: for within a while after the
ardente heat of their lyberall deuocy^ waxyd cold. And because they continued
not still in bringing in their oblacyons: the hutches and coffers were emptye
ere men wist yt. Then whiles yt was compassyd what way might be best taken for
the preseruacyon of this ordinance, least yt should decay, to their confufyon
that began yt: some gave counsel that yt should be necessary to depryue the
clergy of their goods, and to dystrybute their possessions, lands, and
rentys among lay people. And to throw down all monasteries and churches /
making coin of crosses, chalessys and other sacred jewels, for ye suste^^^cyon
of the poor as they allegyd. This advise with ho^e assent of certain princes
and comonteys was approuyd / affyrmynge that if so infynyte riches were onys in
their handys / the revenues of great men should be so enlargyd, that they
should need to raise no taxys nor lones of the commons / but rather cease from
all importable exaccyons. In like manner by the same polycy the^ commons might
grow unto such welthy substance: that beggars and nedy people few or none
should be found among them, which ought to be called a golden world or a time
of felycyte.


N. And ca^ it not so to pass in conclusyo^?


W. No, nor never shall I make you assurance, for the goods ar wasted and no
man can tell how: ye at this hour the princes and lords of ye cities a^more
hungry to pyll and pole then ever they were. The commons also in less wealth,
enduryng more grievous oppressyo^ then ever they did, with no fewer miserable
persons then they had before / all things as out of mesure scarce / each
complaining to other of their calamyties unfortunate without remedy of
redress or hope of a of a b^tter change.


N. Our lord forbede yt yt should chance so h^re.


W. yet lack there no^ in England that wysh full heartily after such a
ruffelyng change / the more part such as hope to win and have nothing to
lose / and yet some so mad that have of their own, and why the happily might
pe^t it first of all. I let pass my lord cardynalls act in pullyng down and
supp^ssing of religious places, our lord assoile his soul. I will wrestle with
no soulys: he knows by this time whyther he did well or evil. But this dare
I be bold to say / that the contreys where they stood find such lack of
them: that they would he had let them stand. And thynk you then that there
would be no lak founden if ye remanaunt were so served to? I wene men would so
sore mysse them that many which speak, against the^ / would sone labor his own
handys to set them up again.


N. In good faith your words make me so amasyd, that I cannot tell what I may
say to the matter: I se the living of the clergy is far wide from the
doctrine of Christ and example of thappostles / ^ ye Lutheranes by your saying
be i^ wors case / both destitute of catholic faith and good christian manners,
without any better lykelyhode except by the means of a general reformacyon.


W. who should be the auctours of this reformacyon?


N. The pope and either christian pryncys.


W. I put case that many of them be as wide owte of the right way as the
other.


N. That can ye tell partly concerning this popes holiness / for ye were
lately at Rome.


W. In very deed I herd pyteously of yt by other me^nes report, but I saw yt
not: and pera^uenture I saw the less / because I tarried so little while there.
Natwythsta^dyng yt fortuned me to talk with an Italyan / and in our
communycacion I spoke as I had hard, that the pope and the emperor entendyd a
reformacyon. why said he they have begone all redye. I asked him where. Se ye
not quod he that they have destroyed Lombardye, Italye, Naples, and also
enpouered France, to the ruynous decay of cryste^dome? Beware said I what ye
speak. yes quod he / for I mean no dyshonoure to their hyghnes / for they
perform the will and commandment of god as they of Syrya and Babylone did
in destroyng ye evil chylderen of Israhell, to thentent the good might
prospere in their placys. Mary Quoth I that is clean contrary here / for the good
be destroyed and the evil are increased / so that never in Italye were seen so
many vagaboundes, thieves, hores, and harlottys, as are in this present time.
well said he / if ye good be rather destroyed as ye allege, and the evil are
still reseruyd: yt is a toke^ that they have escaped with an easy scorge the
dredefull ve^geaunce of god, which remains for these ye be left behynd.
Howbeyt y^ read in stories of the bible, that ye sinful world was first
destroyed before that ryghteous, Noe, was possess^^ ^^r of ye fruitful yerth,
bly^^ed of god / and the abomynable cyteys of Sodom and Gomor vterly subuertyd
ere virtuous Loathe ascendyd the mount of his refuge. Also the reprobate people
of Israhell were holly extyncte ere ever their elect children entryd the land
of promys. wherefore construe ye as ye please, I fear me that the reformacyon
of the world shall be with the sword of ve^geaunce upon the people for their
iniquyte / consyderyng ye obduracyon of their hartys, and hard neckyd
stubburnes / not mouyd at the wonderful tokens which daily pronostycate the
wrath of god to be at hand. with this he shranke away and would tarry no
longer.


N. Peraduentur he was afraid to wade further in the trothe. But believe me if
ye will / where he spoke of the destroynge of evil people: I wene if Lutheranys
be such as ye make the^, yt were the redyest way for a reformacyon to kill up
them quyte.


W. I would rather wyshe them ame^dyd if yt may be. And as for killing them
in some place yt were no great maistry. But the^ in some other placys where
would ye find ye people to do the execucyon?


N. we should lack none in England I warant you / for there be many of the
clargye that would be full glad of yt, and marchauntys some, though many be on
their side. Also ye might have a great sort of ye commons, and many courtyers,
though some of every sort favor Luthers ways and some great mennys
seruau^tys bear men in hand that their souereyns support such matters specially
in tauerns, merchants howses, and other placys / where they make the^ selves
no small fools when wise me^ be forth a doors.


W. For ye understand not what ye say.


N. How so?


W. For if we will put away all Lutheranes and all such open heresies, we
must first put away many other synnys which have brought those heresies in.
For trow ye that heresies the most terryble plage of god / comes not through
sin of the people provoking his ire and indygnacyon / whereby he sendyth
among them false prophets and erronyous teachers, prechyng matters according
to their waywarde appetytes.


N. yet prestys and clarkys are ye bryngers up of heresies and ye chief
maynteyners of them, by occasyon of popes, cardynalles, bishops, and other
prelatys of the clergy.


W. I will neither excuse nor accuse neither them nor other. But I fere me yt
as for other sins the clargie and the lay to shall not need to strive
therefore / but may well agree together and part the stake between them. And as
for heresies, though some of the clergy comenly begin them: yet if we look
on old chronicles with experye^ce of our own time, we shall well find that
there has not lckked some great temporal pryncys, nor a great number of lewd
lay people / to set them forth and support them. was not the orygynall ground
and cawse of M. Luthers heresye to do pleasure to his prince, and to purchase
favor among the people. In like manner Oecolam padius, zwynglius, Pharellus,
and other mo followed the same trace. when princes and como^ties at first bent
upon affeccyo^ against ye church, or co^ceyue any strange purpose ^trary to
scripture: then immedyatly they find at hand such learned persons that can
endeavor their brains in approuyng their lusts / making yt which is
unlawful lawful, which say that good is yuell and yuell is good, calling
light darkness and darkness light.


N. We shall find the^ among which prech such thyngys as ye call heresye for
no such cause / but preche it boldly before great audye^ce, where they for
their prechyng be brought in great danger.


W. Though they do fall in harm, yet have they hope to win their favor / or
else why are they so desirous to have so many ley me^ present at their
examynacio^s?


N. They make of it a reasonable cause for.ii. co^sideracio^s One is to
thynte^t they might not be wrongefully oppressyd in corners: a another is
because they would that people should bear wytnes of their co^stancy in
confessyng the truth for Crystys sake.


W. These co^syderacyons in them if they were true as they be falls: were yet
of small efficacite and against the euangelyke perfeccion. As towchynge the
first, god promyseth if his seruauntys be wrongyd pryuely / he will revenge
them openly. And Christ in the gospel exhortyng us to suffraunce / byddeth his
dyscyples to be joyful in persecucio^ / sayng yt happy are ye when ye are
belyed, evil spoken upon, and extremely dealte wythall for my names sake. The
other apperythe to be an excuse of vaynglory coveting wordly prays / where as
they perceive that people fauourynge their part will interpret to their
commendacyon what so ever they say, though yt be against scripture / contrary
to all verite. Saint Peter wylleth us to give acounte of our faith to every
body / and that my dely with all lowlynes. we have no presydent of
thappostles, that ever they dysdayned to a^swere before the infydele iuges,
till ye vulgar multitude were by them / or that they required assystence of
great men to be records of their words. wherefore I meruell what conscience
these persons have / which are so importune to be examyned in presence of rude
seculers and ignorant people / when they answer so dowtfully that the best
^^ernyd can not well construe their meaning. And in pryncypall artycles where
upon depends our saluacyo^ or dampnacyon: some answer so nakydly with blind
shyfts, that they be able to bring un lernyd people in to error of things
whereof they never doutyd before / using ever over thwart speech and quaylynge
sentences of dowble understanding, with protestacyons of hypocrysye after this
fassion: In good faith I think there is a purgatory, albeyt I can not tell
whether I may believe yt or no. I suppose that confession made to a priest, and
pylgrymagys may be well done / but I find them not in scripture: I believe in
these wordis of Cryft, this is my body / but as concerning his bodily presence
in form of bread, to say any thing yt is above my capacyte / and I dare not
meddle with so dyffuse matters. I reke^ that I may believe ye doctors of the
church if they speak not against the word of god. etc. To use such a^bages in
weyghtye causes, and to put in questyo^ a fresshe the cases defyned by general
counsels, as though we were uncertain of our belefe and new to begin again: I
repute yt no spyryte of trothe seeking goddys honor and edificacio^ of their
neighbor. Nor I dout not but at the day of judgment, they shall make a more
seryous answer. This co^syderacyo^ is also as I have said very plainly false.
For when these siy shyftes fail the^: they show no co^stancy of their
unfaithful doctrine / but falsely forswere them self and say they never said
so / the hole audye^ce detestyng their perjury all save only their own sect /
which as for perjury pardon each other. To speak of manifest myssliuers and
open transgressors, whom may we well exempte? considering how prone and ready
ye hole world is from the most to the least, to declyne and fall unto evil.
Our faith which god has given us to bylde good works upon is waxen barayne
and fruteles. Charity likewise, wherein we should be tried to be the very
dyscyples of Christ / is waxed cold through ye excess of iniquyte. Amyable
concord with cryste^ unity, whervppo^ all virtue fastenyth her fundacyon is
fallen in ruin / to the fre entresse of hateful dysce^io^ and lyberte of al
vices. In every state and degree, ye one barkyth at the other / one obiectyth
against a another his fawtys / each of them facynge other to be causes of their
myseryes / and yet never a one fassyoneth him self toward any amendeme^t for
his own part.


N. By my trothe I deem the people would be good enough, if they had good heads.


W. I deny not ye verily, but the better that the heads be the better were
the body like to be / and ye evil yt is in evil heads desce^deth down in to
every part, and makes all the body the worse. And yet surely if ye people be
evil: the sin of them causes god sometime to send them heads of the same
suit, both popes, emperors, kyngys, cardynallys, bysshoppes, prestys, and
curatys. For yt is the sin of the people as Iobtestyfyeth, that causes god
to suffer hypocrytys sometime to rain over them. Hypocrytes he calls them
that represente the personages of these estates, whose parts they do play for
a countenance, and do the contrary in deed. And as far as I have read in
ye bible / all ye while yt the people of Israhell were good obeyng goddys lawys
and sought his honor: god gave them gracyous governors, virtuous prestes,
and true prophets. But as soon as they swaruyd and fell unto ydolatry: he
sent the^ for their punishment ungracious pryntes, vycyous prelatys, and falls
prophetys / so that no dyfference was between ye people and the prestys / nor
ye people coud not ymagyne so outragyous abomynacyo^s, but princys and prestys
both were ready to fortefye them in their unhappiness.


N. yet if ye remember well the stories of the bible / ye shall find yt the
tra^sgressyo^ of goddys law among the people / redownded first from ye heads by
their pernycyous occasyon. And as to wchynge falls prophets and ill prestes:
god him self greuous^y complayneth upon them / showing how the people are
seducyd by them to the pollutynge of his name and vyolacyon of his laws. whose
enmyous wyckednes Ezechiell, Hieremye, with diverse other prophets, declare at
length. Did not the Belyal preastes Ophni and Phynes by their pestylent example
and lecherous living corrupt many one / upon whom god taking vengeance /
they lost their lives in battle / and the ark of god whereof they had ye cure
taken by the Phylysteys / xxx. thousand fighting men of the Israhelyte people
were slain in one day. Likewise ye children of Samuel which were iuges of
the people / not ensuynge their fathers steps but set apo^ covetousness, took
rewards and peruertyd judgment / by whose occasyon the people were mouyd to
ask a king unto their desolacyon. Moreover the storye of king Saull is
plain, for whose pryuate dysobedye^ce ye hole land of Israhell smarted full
sore. King Dauyd though he was a blyssed man, yet brought unto folly for to
number his people / they were feign to suffer most woeful plages for his
offense. Many other like placys I coud gather out of ye old testament, were
yt not to eschew tedyousnes / specially of Hieroboam, whom ye scripture
testyfyeth expressly, that he caused ye people of Israhell to sin. Beside all
this go to the very experyence / and ye shall find yt where soever the head
or go uernour of an house is good / the hole howsholde comenlye shall be good
also. And contrary wise if they be badde / the other shall be as evil / so
that I may conclude in veryfyeng mine opinion / that the ill co^uersacyon of
subgectys procedyth out of ye evil example of their heads.


W. To begin where as ye leave / I grant yt the virtuous example of ye head
avails much to the good order of the members / and the greater that the
auctoryte is, the more strength yt has in example, either to profit or to noy
/ consyderyng that among pryuate persons the goodness of some one, e^ducyth
many other to virtue / and contrary the lewdnes of another, brings many to
vice and vngracyousnes. But yet ca^ not ye ^clude upon this, that ye euylnes of
the people comyth first by the example of the heads / but rather as I have
spoken before, because ye people be evil them selfs / therefore god sendyth
them according ill heads and governors. For ye must consider that god has
not made the people for ye sensual pleasure of pryncys, governors, or
prelatys / but has ordained them to yt we all and commodyte of the people. ye
have in Exodus the third chapyter, that when the people of Israhell were in
miserable thraldom under king Pharo: they cried to god for remedy / and god
provided them Moses to be their delyuerer / to whom in gyuyng his of^yce he
said: The clamoure of the children of Israhell is come unto me and I have seen
their afflyccyons how they are oppressyd of the Egypcians: therefore approach
and I shall send the to belyuer my people. ye, god loved the people so entyerly,
that of them he chose bysshoppes, prestes, and deakenes, to offer special
sacrefyces for the clensynge of their sins / and to be as means between him
and the. Note of whom also Moses took the noble and wise men / and made of
the^ prices, captayns and governors, for their polytyke conseruacion.
Agreeable to this the stories of Iudicum make r^encion, that the people of
Israhell long season after Iosues death obseruyng goddys laws and fulfyllyng
his commandments prosperyd in peace and had gracyous governors. But when
they fell to sin and ydolatry: god gave them in to subieccyon of their enemies
/ and were compellyd whether they would or not to serve hethen pryncys and
myscreau^t ydolaters / yet notwythstandynge in myddys of their myseryes, where
as with a repentau^t heart they cried to god for socour, and besought him of
mercy: he raysde up among the^ selves certain captains at so^dry times / as
Othonyell, Ayoth, Gedeo^, Sampson, and diverse other / which delivered them
from all bondage / restorynge the^ again to their lyberte. And where as ye
allege the children of Helye to have been cawse of the taking of the arc and
slawghter of the people: I believe verily that ye people were then myscheuously
myndyd as they be now a days. which perceyuyng yt the. ii. prestes yt bare
ye arc whereby they hopyd of victory, were slain: they surmysed that the
vengeance for the prestes sins was cawse why the arc was taken and so much
people destroyed. and under this blind audacyte they remained still impenyte^t
/ not aknowlegyng to god their own offenses and ydolatrye: which apperyth by
the return again of the arc / where above the number of.l. thousand persons
were plagyd with sudden death. Also it may be verefyed by ye wordys of Samuel
exhortyng the people to return unto god with heart vnfaynyd / and to cast owte
all strange goddys, preparynge their hartys to ye service of god only. For
when they had fastyd and done penance, not imputynge ye fawte to other but
to the^ selfs / sayng all we good lord have sinned against the: god delivered
the^ from their enemies. In like manner ye mysorder of Samuel lys sons was
not so greatly the occasyon why the people were mouyd to ask a king for to
reygne over them / as was their own dyffydence toward goddys puisio^,
obstynate dysobedyence, and vnquyete appetyte of ydolatrye / coveting to be
like other hethe^ nacyo^s: which is to be perceived by the answer of god unto
Samuel thus sayng: Here the peoples voice in all things that they speak unto
the / they have not cast yt of but me, least I should re^gne over the^. They
do eue^ according to all their works which they did in the day yt I brought
them out of Egypt hitherto. As they have forsaken me and served falls goddys /
thus do they also to the. when Samuel had showed unto them the dyspleasure
of god, with the manyfolde myseryes and calamytyes which they should suffer by
the change: yet would they not here him / but said that nedys they would have a
king over them as other people had. Furthermore ye afferme yt ye people of
Israhel were punyshed for the dysobedyent tra^sgressyon of king Saull. But all
things considered yt is to be thought rather that their wylful frowardnes
against god was partly occasyon of his fall / to thente^t the sentence of god
spoken by ye prophet might be verefyed. For if he had been an upright prince
and had observed gods commandment: they should have been in such felycyte
that they would have iuged their pe^ycyon lawful in demaundyng a king
contrary to goddys pleasure. And I dowt not but god gave them a king of
dysposycyon like to their demeanoure / so yt when he transgressyd goddys
p^cept in deed / they did the same, at the last i^ will and consent / whereby
they deseruyd to be punysshed with him. For god never takes ve^geaunce upon
any people but only for their sin / which after diverse admonycio^s why les
they will not amend / eue^ as he gives to the good people gracyous heads and
princes, furtheryng them in his favor to their ^fort: so sends he to the
evil wicked heads and rulers, provoking his wrath to their desolacio^. And no
meruell though Saull faryd the worse for his people / where as Moses the most
faithful servant of god was partly by their frowardnes debarred from the
pleasant land of behest. As for king dauyd, it is plain that god dyspleasyd
with the chyldern of Israhell for their sins: permyttyd Satan to incyte him
for to number his people, wherefore they were both punysshed. And though
scripture expressly says that Hie ^oboa^ caused ye people to sin: yet were
they as mich fauty as he / save yt because they committed their ydolatry under
his supportacyon, he bare ye name as pryncypall auctor: as we se ye captay as
of hosts in war time though some of them do sometime as little or less
tha^ many a poor souldyer in his army whose act is nothing spoken of / yet
all the fame and honor of the vyctory rebowndyth ever unto them. which is
apartely prouyd by the oracyo^ of king Abya Roboams sone / laynge to the
peoples charge that they forsook god and made them golden calves / expulsyng
the prestes and deakenes of goddys ordinance, and instytutynge other after the
order of hethen ydolaters. whereto agrees in defense of mine opynio^, the
general confession of the people with their universal submyssyo^ i^ knowledge
of their trespaces, recyted i^ sundry placys of scripture after this for me: we
have sinned with our forefathers / we have done wyckedly, and have committed
iniquyre / all we have tra^sgressyd thy commaundementys. And surely as the
world is now crokedly enclyned to malice: if god sent heads and pryncys
according to the deuelys^he appetytes of much people / ye wealth of this regyo^
would be sone subverted and every state brought to confusyon, albeit they
otherwise color yt and make as though they meant non harm, but rather much
devotion / and yt the unlearned would have the scripture in to their handys for
none other cause but only to preche secretly to them self for lack of good
preachours abroad. But then in deed y^ apperyth that they preach to the^ self
and their neighbors to, many an horrible horosye, and abuse the scripture to
the colorable defense of the same. And then are they also to, all Tyndals bokys
/ which for the manyfolde mortal heresies contained within the same openly
condempnyd and forbeden / they are I say yet unto those books so sore
affeccionate, that neither the condempnacyo^ of them by the clergy, nor the for
bedyng of them by the kyngys hyghnes with his open proclamacyo^s upon great
pains / nor the danger of open shame, nor parell of paynfull death / ca^ cast
the^ out of some fond folkis hands, and that folk of every sort. How think
ye then these folk would have been stomaked, and how many mo would have
blustred, out with them / if the mayntenau^ce of the princes and the states of
the reame (which our lord defend) had been upon their side. And where about
would they then have gone? abowte no great good ye may be sure. Se ye not the
vyllayne beggars and valyau^t vagabou^des, whom god plageth with pouerte and
myserye for their abomynable living / dysposed to no goodness, how heartily
they wysshe for a ruffelynge day. Behold every state all most in every
cryste^ realm, as husband me^, artyfycers, marchaunts, courtyers, with all
other degrees as well spyrituall as te^porall / and I fere me that ye shall
say, but if god of his goodness amend us the sooner / there shall come to pass
among us the ferefull judgment of god spoken by the prophet O see, to the
people of Israhell and inhabyters of the land: There is no trothe, no mercy,
nor science of god in the yerth. Cursynge and lyenge, manslaughter, theft, and
aduowtrye has ouerf^owen / and blood has towchyd blood: for the which the
yerth shall wayle, and every inhabyter in yt shall be feeblyd. And this as I
have said not one country fawty and a another fawtles, one estate foul and
deformed and another pure and clean, the spyrytualtye sinful and ye
temporaltye set all on virtue, the heads and rulers culpable and the people
out of blame, nor yt any estate may lay the hole weight of gods wrath unto
the other and thereof discharge them self / but each of them is cause both of
their own harm and other folkys to. And the people are nothing less fawty
provoking the wrath of god, than their heads or gouernoures / nor one state
party culerly cawse of another calamyte. But all we together have sinned and
have deseruyd the vengeance of god, which hangyth before our eyes ready to
fall ere we be aware.


N. In this point ye have right well satysfyed my mind: but what remedy now
of reconcy lyacyon again to god?


W. Forsothe I know none but only penance. I say not repentyng only as
Luther and Tyndall and these new folks call yt / which would begyle us and
make us wene yt we need no more but only repent and do no penance at all /
tellyng us that Crystys passion shall stand instead of all our penance,
though we do never so evil and live never so long. with this false doctrine
they drive many a soul to the devil / making them neglygente and take
little care or sorrow for their sin / and so myche the more rechelesse in
falling to sin again. But I speak of penance as yt unplyeth both
repe^tau^ce of our sins past / and ye sacrament of peuau^ce, with care and
sorrow and bodily pain and afflyccyo^ taken for our syn, with prayer, almouse,
and other good workys to purchase the more grace / and yt we should with
recourse to confession and the sacrament of penance, dylyge^tly prepare our
selves in folowi^g the example of the Nynyuytes^: which at the preaching of
the prophet Jonas, repentyd with ernest purpose of amendynge their lives / and
did penance in deed, in fasting and prayer, humblynge their sowles from
the most to the least unto the mercy of god.


N. would our lord that we had such a prophet sent among us to exhort us
unto penance as the prophet Jonas was to them.


W. That were like to the request of the rich gluttone in hell of who^ the
gospel tells / which desired that Lazare might besente to warn his
brethern: to whom yt was answered, that having Moses and the prophets, they
should give credence to them. wherefore seeing that we have holy scripture which
expressyth the rightwysnes of god / declaring how our forefathers were
punysshed for their sins: if we refuse to be warnyd by their admonycyon,
truly we would be as neglygent to amend, if Jonas raised from death to life
should preach unto us. For we have saint Iohu^ baptyst a greater prohete tha^
Jonas was cryenge to all sinners: Do ye worthy fruits of penance: of whom
Christ wytnessyth that there is none greater than he among the children of
women. Also our save our Christ him self, of whom saint Ihon^ restyfyed that
he was unworthy to lose his shoo latchet: preachyd penance saying: Do ye
penance, the kingdom of heuyn is at hand. And in another place of the
gospel he says: if ye do not penance ye shall all perysshe. And saint Peter
his vycare here i^ yerth, upon whom and whose faithful confession he promised
to bylde his church: preachyd likewise in his first sermon sayng: Do ye
penance and be conuertyd to god, that your synnys may be done away. Also
saint poule the chose vessel of god, preached first of all to them of Damasco,
that they should be penytent and turn to god / perfourmynge the due warkes of
penance. Co^fyrmynge the same when Christ apperyd unto the.ii. dyscyples
iorneing to Emaus: he said yt after his death and resurreccyon yt be / houyd
penance to be preachyd in his name and remyssyon of sins: for why ye cause
of his coming was not to call rygh teous folk but sinners unto penance. And
the aungellys of heuyn rejoiced not so greatly in nynty and nine just persons,
as upon one sinner doing penance. As concerning the old testament / god him
self promyseth in diverse placys, that a sinner shall be forgyuen his sins
when so ever he will do penance. wherefore sei^g we have so euyde^t exhortacyo^s
of scripture mouynge us to penance, and manyfolde warnynges to correct our
lives through the the pacyent suffraunce of god: happy ar we yet, if now at
last ere that yt be to late me cowde faithfully say with Iobe perfourming ye
deed: lord we have hard ye with our ears, and therefore we rep^he^de our
selfs and do penance.


N. yet wot I not well what ye call penance.


W. I have onys told you and yet I tell you again I call penance a change of
our life i^ castyng of ye sinful old man with his dedys, and doing on a new
man of virtuous conuetsacyon / which by faith, hope, and charity, and the good
works yt come of them / as prayer almouse, sorrow for his sin, and pain
gladly taken and sustained for the same / is renewed in to the knowledge and
favor of god, according to his image that made him.


N. how should lay me^ come to this knowledge when ye gospel is lockyd fro them.


W. The gospel of Christ which is gods word is free, and can not be bound
nor kept from any Christian man.


N. By saint Marye for all that say people may not be fuffred to have the
new testament men glysshe, which I call the gospel.


W. O ye mean Tyndals gospel.


N. In deed though Tyndall was the tra^slatour / yt is the word of god and the
very same testament which ye have in latin of the euangelystes putting forth.


W. yet lernyd me^ and good men have founden such fawtys in his corrupt
translacio^: that yt is for the same well and lawfully forbede^.


N. if they be good men as ye say yt have found yt fauty: I should reken the^
better a great deal / which would amend it.


W. Though yt were ame^dyd and suffycyently correctyd: yet will I not say yt yt
is expedyent for lay people to have yt co^syderyng ye time as yt is now.


N. why ye said yt the gospel may not be kept from christian me^.


W. No more yt may though yt be restrained from the lay people in their
vulgar tongue. For ye word of god which is the word of faith as scripture
says / is nere the in thy mouth and in thy heart to thentent thou may do yt.


N. Than I pray you where saint Poule says that faith comyth by herynge, and
herynge comyth by the word of god: how can we have yt without prechynge or
informacyon of yt by redynge of scripture.


W. Outward prechyng and lyterall redyng of scripture are necessary means to
attain unto the knowledge of the spyryte.


N. wherefore then is the gospel wythholden from the lay people?


W. I said they be two things necessary / but I said not that both twain be
to every man necessary. But yt is necessary that every man have the tone or the
the other, and so have they: for they have the word of god prechid and expowned
unto the.


N. ye as the prestes list with false gloses.


W. with the same gloses that the old holy doctors and sayntys have made /
other manner of me^ tha^ Luther and Tyndale which now corrupt the truth with
their false gloses.


N. But why should not the come^ people have the scripture them self in their awn
mother tongue?


W Because of their abuse and making of their own glosys, and many also for
their unworthiness, according to Crystes commandment forbeddynge to cast
per^es before swyne, or to give holy thyngis to dogs. Did not saint Paul
forbede women to speak the word of god in congregacyons, for the auoydyng of
abuse and dysorder? Also did not he and Batnabas forsake prechyng to the jews
because of their unworthiness?


N. That is not a like case: for the text is plain yt the jews wylfully
resystyd the word of god, and would not receive yt. But these people are so
desirous / that they put them selfs in no small ieopardye many times for
the having of yt.


W. I grant there be some which of a good mind are desirous to have the
gospel in their mother tongue, for ye erudycio^ and ^fort of their souls. But
they that be such good folk may be well and sufficiently fed with ye gospel
p^ched / and so will they rather chese to be than to have the scripture run
in every rasshe bodies hand, yt would abuse it to their own harm and other
menys to. For well ye wot many there he, and as yt apperethe in Almayn where
they have the scripture translated all ready / the more part and far the
greater multitude, are not less unworthy in receyuynge yt, than were the jews
in the wylfull resystau^ce of Crystes gospel* which covet it only for the
lybertye to be fre from the excercyse of penance and doing of good works, to
rail and jest of other men's fawtes without any correccio^ of their own
sinful lives / nothing conformable to the vertew of the gospel, whereof to
babble many words they are not dombe. Mark it there substauncyally in cities
and towns where ye se ye people most ryfest and most busye to prate of the
gospel / whether they be or not as great usurers, dysceyuers of their
neybours, blasphemous sweters, evil spekers, and given to all vices as depely
as ever they were. This I am sure of and dare boldly afferme / that sithe the
time of this new co^te^ryous lernyng, the dread of god is gretely quenched, and
charytable co^passyon sore ababated. Shall ye not se there a cock braynyd
courtyer yt has no more faith tha^ a Turk, and less christian manners tha^ a
Pagane, with lordely cou^tenau^ce and knauysh condycyons / which taking ye name
of god i^ bayn, shall irreverently allege the gospel with scoffyng and
scornynge in reprehensyon of the clargye: where as his own lewd living is so
unthrifty, that ye can not aspye one good point in him, except yt be apo^ his
hosen / nor a nynche of honesty beside his apparayle nor scantly thereon
neither, being all to hackyd and iaggyd, with dowble weapen ready to fight, and
syngle wit busy to brawle and chyde / more like a furyous tormentour of Herod,
than a pacye^t dysciple of Christ Shall ye not also se there a merchant
pera^e^ture made a gentle man by promocion, ere ever that he had a good yema^s
cond^cyo^s: which getting his chief substance as many do there by usury /
false dysceyte of true people, and other wrongful ways / will take upon him
to preach the gospel against the auaryce of relygyous persons / how they
having their bare necessary food, ought to part ye resydue of their gooddes
with pore people: where as he him self has thousands lyenge by him in store
unoccupied, and will another help his poor neighbor nor scarcely give a galy
halpeny to a nedy creature in extreme necessyte. And at their belly festi^g
days, among such of their affynyte which are not so wise nor well lernyd as
they would be seen / if yt chance them to have in company some simple priest:
yt is a wonder to here how he is apposed / and after that their spyrytes be a
little kyndled in glotony, how they lasshe out the gospel. Than begins one
or a another with his potycarye formalyte and holy day grauyte / to move some
subtyle questyo^, sayng: master person how say ye to such a text of Poule?
And if ye priest be ignorant for lack of learning, or makyth not an answer
satysfyenge his mind: he is mockyd and iestyd upon with scornful de^ysyon.
Then begin they to canuasse the scripture among them, with fyllynge the
cups and ioly gentyl chere. And by ye time they have eaten more than enough,
and have dronken to much: they be ready to wade forth in ye deep mysteryes of
scripture / willing to be teachers of things whereof they understand not what
they speak nor what they afferme. Then are they full armyd to talk of
abstynence and sobr^ diet of thappostles: their table being furnysshed with
sumptuous dysshes and exquysyte deyntyes. And where as their cuppbordes be
ryally garnysshed with costely plate, and the tables full of cups and pieces
of silver and gold: than make they exclamacyo^s against the rych iewellys of
chyrches, as crosses and chalyses / sayng that better it were to make money of
them and to be dystributyd unto pore people, than they should perysshe for lack
of socoure* Likewise when they be served at their solempnytyes, with
counterfeyted curtesyes, in bowynge the kne, and valyng the bonet, having
sewers and and karuers after a most stately manner of service, wherein if the
officers fail never so little though yt be but the setting of a sawcer amysse
they shall be rebukyd: yet their peuy^h pacyence can not brook the honest
ceremonies of the church to be lawdably done / calling them folysshe
fantasyes and inuencyons of ydyotes. And though some of these new gospellers
occupye trewelye and justly with their neighbors in face of the world, be
having them selfs charitably: yet are they very few in co^paryson of the
other, which be raylers and gesters, vycyous lyuers and falls hypocrytes with
out any conscience.


N. As for hypocrytes I think ye might find sooner amongere lygyous persons.


W. will ye believe me. I have walked a great part through owte all the
prouynces of cryste^dome, and have seen and marcked the state of relygyous
persons of diverse orders: yet saw I never among them such colouryd
hypocrysye, so flesshely lybertye abusyd, under ye pretense of feigned holiness /
as among many of these late inuentyd faccyons. And I certyfye you that ye may
find mo diverse sectys of erronyous opynyons among them in one cite beyond the
se: than be sondrye orders of religyous people in all England.


N. Suppose ye ye gospel to be in fault of this?


W. Nay / but the abuse of the people having yt in their vulgar language: for
whom yt were better to receive yt by the mynystracyon of faithful preachers,
than unworthily to take it them selfs. we have in the gospel yt our savior
Christ tedynge the number of.v. thousand men beside women and children / first
gyuyng thankys to his father he blyssed the bread, brake yt and gave yt to his
dyscyples, and they dystrybutyd yt to the company / and so they did eat and
were sacyate.


N. Sir according to this ye people should hold them very well content, if so be
they had faithful prechers to mynyster the word of god unto the^. But I put
case they have none, or else that their peachers be such as the prophet
co^playneth on / which preach ye vysyo^ of their hart^ and not of ye mouth of
god: seking also their own worldly proffyte, and not the gostly comfort of
their cures.


W. I believe yt god has not left his church destytute of faithful preachers
/ with the which he has promnysed to be contynually present unto the worldys
end. How be yt the fewer that they be / the more fawte is to be imputed unto
the people, becawse they ask not worthily of god true preachers. For the
gospel shows that the people came first to Christ / and he perceyuyng the^
was mouyd with compassyon upon them, becawse they were as sheep having no
heard / and so feadynge their sowles spyrytually, afterward he did repaste
their bodies with corporal food. wherefore if they in like manner approach
unto Christ (in whose name what so ever is desired of the father shall be
grau^tyd) he will also here gracyously their petycyon: for the hand of god is
not abreuyatt now / nor his power otherwise mynysshed than yt was at that time.


N. yet am not I so satysfyed with all the reasons yt ye have made / but I
think still that yt were lawful for lay people to have the new testament in
English: and perauenture with a little leyser I cowd lay such scripture for
yt / that scant ye should be able to obiecte any contradyecyon.


W. ye shall have leyser ynowgh. But in the mean time this ye must consider yt
our question is not whyther it be lawful to let them have yt / but whyther yt
be unlawful to keep them from it / and why there of the twayn is more mete and
more expedyent, specially for the time that now is the people being dysposed
as they now be / and after such ensample as we see before our iyen, with
such fruit as we find growe^ thereof in Almayne all ready and in many placys
even here at home also. But if ever the time come as I pray god yt may / in
which the people shall be so good and so godly dysposed that an english
bible should do good in their hands: yet might Tyndals translacyon in no wise
be suffered.


N. well I shall bethynke me till we mete again / and then will I be so bold
also to take Tyndals part in defense of his translacyon and other bokys which
he has put forth in english, allegyng the best that I can for their
alowance: to thentent I may see what strong reasons ye can bring to confute
them.


W. There with am I right well pleasyd / and I trust with gods help to answer
you so effectuously that ye shall not count the time passed in vain.


N. Than fare ye well till a another season.


W. Our lord be with you.
