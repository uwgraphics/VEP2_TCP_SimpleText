A treatise perswadynge a man patientlye to suffer the death of his friend.



Into this world naked we entered
And so we must again out of it fare
Death By no man can Be defended.
There is no kynes thing it will spare
Than wherefore should we for it care
At avails not / But pass forth /
The hard strokes (chance they unware)
And patiently take them in worth.
For they that take death vnpacienly
Seem to the world to set their mind
Blessed Be they that in our lord dye
For they Be sure the very life to find.
A comfortable exhortation against the chances of death / made by Erasmus Rot.
How bitter and how grievous a wound perceth your fatherly heart / for the
death of your most goodly child / I lightly co^recte by mine own sorrow.
And therefore I were right much vncourtoys / if that I in so sorrowful a
chance would warn you his father to make lamentation / when I that am but a
stranger can not chose but weep and wayle. Ye might well think me rude and
untaught / if I would go about to heal your gresse / when I my self had need
of a physician: if I would let you his father to weep / when the tears
stylle abundauntlye trykell down from mine eien.

And all be it / that the ilke stroke of Fortune ought deper to perce your
fatherly breast: yet your great wisdom was wont so to rule you (in all your
deeds) that ye not only with a strong and a stout mind / but also with a
glad and a merry chere / would suffer and pass over all such chances as hap
to mankind. wherefore ye ought so to settell your self / that if ye can not
as yet put away clean the sorrow of your heart (for no man can deny but that
ye have right good cause to be heavy) yet at the least wise some what suppress
and moderate the same dolor. And for what cause should ye not clean forgette
it? saying that the space of a few days will cause idiottes so to do / me
thinks reason should persuade an excellent wise man. For what selye mother
does so extremely bewail the death of her child / but that in short space of
time her sorrow some what asslaketh / and at length is clean forgotten? To have
always a steadfast mind / is a token of a perfect wise man. But for those
chances / unto the which we all egally (both more and less) be subject /
to sorrow out of measure / me thinks it extreme folys henes. For who is not
ware (except he that myndeth nothing) that he is borne under such a
condition / that when so ever god will call him: he must forth with needs
depart hence? So than what other thing (I prey you) does he / that bewayleth
ones death / than lamentably complain / that he is mortal? Or why should we
rather sorrow the departing* hence / than the entering in to this world /
considering that both are egally natural? Eue^ in like case as though one should
give great thanks for to be called to a great feast or dinner / and would
lament and demean great sorrow / wha^ he should depart away thence.

If that a man / as hit were from an high lokynge place / would advise well
the condition and life of all mankind: might he not well reken him self a
nyce fellow / if he among so manyfolde examples of privation / and among so
thycke buryals of young and old / would be grievously vexed in his mind / as
though unto him only were chanced some new and great yuell: and as though
he only being happy above other / would desire and look to stand without the
common lotte? For which consideration the excellent wise men that found and
made laws in old time / to then tent that they would some what incline to the
affections of pare^tes / and to the end they would not be seen to exclude every
body from that passion / being also condemned of some of the stoicke
philosophers: they lymytted unto the^ a certain time to mourn / the which
endured not very long: Either because that they well understood and knew /
that in those manner of chances / the which are both common to all folks /
and also do not hap through any injury of Fortune / but are induced by the
very course and ordinance of Nature / short mourning should suffice: yea
unto them that were not able to moderate all affections: considering that
Natures self by lyttel and little soupleth the wound that she made / and
wears away the scarre: Or else because they diligently marked / that mourning
was not only unprofitable unto them that were bemoned / but also hurtful to
the^ that made such moan / and grievous and unquiet to their friends /
acqueyntance / and company.

But now if a man would consider the matter a right / does it not seem a
point of madness / wyllyngly of one harm to make twain / and when ye can not
by no manner reason recover your predestinate loss / yet wilfullye to annoye
and hurt your own self? In like manner as though a man that his ennemies has
spoiled of part of his goods / would in his anger throw all that ever
remained in to the sea: and than would say / how he by that mean did bewail
his loss.

If we little regard the noble Mimus / whose saying may beseme any
philosopher to speak: Thou must patiently suffer / and grutche not at it that
can not be amended: Let us call to mind the much goodly example of the right
excellent king David / the which so sone as tidings was brought him / that
his son / that he so tenderly loved / was deed: he forthwith rose up from the
ground / and shaked and brusshed of the duste / he threw away his sherte of
hear / and so when he had washed and an noynted / with a glad countenance
and a merry chere he went to dinner. And by cause his friends maruayled thereat /
he said to them: For what intent should I kylle my self with woe and sorrow?
For unto this time some hope I had / that god being moved with my lamentation
/ would have saved my child a live: but now all our weeping tears can not
restore him again to us a live: we shall shortly speed us hence after him. who
is so fond to crouche and pray him / who^ he knows well will incline to no
prayers? There is nothing more untreatable than death / nothing is more deffe
/ nor nothing more rygorous. By crafty handelynge the savage beastis / yea the
most wild of them all / are made tame: There is a way to break the hard
marbull stone: and a mean to mollify the diamant: but there is nothing /
wherewith death will be appesed or over come. It neither sparethe beauty /
riches / age / nor dignity. And therefore it ought to grieve us much the less
/ either because it can not be esche wed / or else by cause it is egally commune
to us all.

what needs me to go about to reherce to you here the manyfolde exambles of
the gentiles / the which with a noble and a constaunt courage took well in
worth the death of their dear friends? In which constantnes of mind / is it
not a great rebuke for us that be christiens / to be of them over comen? Call
now to your remembrance thilke saying (well worthy to be enrolled in
writynge) of Telamon and Anaxagoras: I wyste well I begotte a mortal creature.

Think upon Pericles the duke of Athens / the which is no less renowned for
his eloquence / than he is for his force and manlynes: al be it that he within.
iiij. days space lost his. ij. sons / that were endewed with right noble
qualities / he not only never changed his chere / but also he / being
crowned (as was the gyse tha^) spoke and reasoned among the people of matters
concerning their common welthe.

Have in mind also Xenophon the worthy scholar of Socrates: to whom tidings
was brought / as he was doing sacrifice / that his son was deed: he made no
more to do but put of his crown / and forthwith did put it on again / as soon as he understood that his son was ma^ly slain in battle.

Remember Dion of Syracuse / the which on a time (as he was secretly talking
with his friends) suddenly hard a great noise and rumblynge in his house: And
when he had inquered what the matter mente / and was enfourmed that his son
had fallen from on high / and was deed: he being therewith nothing amoued /
commanded the corpse (as the manner was) to be delivered to women to burye: For
he said / he would not leave of his pretensed purpose for that matter.

whom Demosthenes following / the vij. day after the death of his only and
most entierly beloved daughter / being crowned and arrayed in a fair white
garment / he came forth abroad among the people. Of which deed the accusation
of his foo Aeschy^ies / both confirmethe the truth / and sets out the
glory.

Think also upon the king Antigonus / the which when he herd tidings /
that his own son was slain in a disordred skermisshe: pausynge a little /
and beholdynge them well that brought him the tydinges / with a stout and a
constante mind he said: O Aleynonen (that was his sons name) all to late
thou perisshest / that would so folisshely cast thy self away among thy
foes / nothing regardyng thine own health nor my monitions and words.

If ye delight more to here the examples of Romans / behold Puluillus horace /
to whom (as he was dedicatynge the capytoll) tidings was brought / that his
son was deed: he neither drew away his hand from the post / nor tourued
not his chere from religion to private sorrow.

Consider how Paulus Aemilius / when he had within the space of. vij. days
lost his. ij. sons / he came forth abroad among the people of Rome / and
there showed them / that he was very glad / that by the lamentation of his
householde (which was but a private sorrow) he had redeemed the envy of Fortune
bente toward them all.

Think also how Q. Fabius Maximus (when he was consul / and had lost his
son / that was than a man in high rowme and dignity / and greatly renowned
for his noble acts) he came forth abroad among the people gethered to gether
/ and there to them he recited the commendation of his son.

Think on also when Cato Censorius his eldest son died / the which was a
yo^ge man of singlar wit and high prowess / and thereto elect and chosen to
be Meyre: yet was he nothing so amoued with that chance / that he would in any
thing more slackelye endeavor him self about the needs and business of the
common welthe.

Ye should remember Marcius / whose surname was king / when his son of
right noble disposition / and that stood highly in the favor and good opinion
of the people / and thereto being his only son / was deed / he took the loss
of him with so constaunt a mind / that forthwith even from the burial of him
he caused the Senators to assemble to gether to ordeyne laws concerning their
common welthe.

Ye should not forget Lucius Sylla / whose valiant and most fierce courage
toward his ennemies / the death of his son could nothing abate / nor cause
that he should seem falsely to have usurped or taken upon him to be called by
this surname Felix / that is to say / luckye or welthy.

when Caius Caesar (that was Sylla his fellow in rowmeth) had invaded Britayne /
and bad tidings that his daughter was deed: yet er three days were fully ended
/ he went about his imperial business.

wha^ Marcus Crassus (in the war that he made against the Parthie^s) beheld
his sons heed / the which his enemies in skorne and derision had set up
on a morispikes end / and the more to exasperate and augme^t his calamity /
they approached nere to his army / and with words of reproach and blame / they
showed it up: he took in worth all that doing with so constant a mind / that
sodaynelye he rode forby all his batayles / and said to them with a loud
voice / that that was his own private harm / but the health and salvation of
the common weal stood in the sauegarde of them his men of war.

But now to over pass the manyfolde examples of Galba / Piso / Sceuola /
Metellus / Scaurus / Marcellus / and Aufidius: remember when Claudius Caesar had
lost him / whom be both begotte / and most entierely loved: yet for all that
he (his own self) in the common pulpit lauded and praised his son / the
cors being present / all only covered with a littell veyle: and when all the
people of Rome wept and bewailed his sons death / he his father wept not a
tear.

And surely like as it is a right good ly thing to follow and do as these men
did: even so were it a right shamfull thing / if men should not be found as
steadfast and as stoutely minded as women have been in such case.

Cornelia saw and beheld her two sons (Tit. Graccus / and Caius Graccus)
slain and unburied: and when her friends comforted her and said / she had a
wretched chance: I will never say (quod she) that I am unlucky or unfortunate
/ that have borne such two children.

But whereto do we now repete these examples out of ancient cronicles: as
though we saw not daily before our face sufficient examples? Behold your
neighbors / behold your kyns folk and alies: how many / yea sely women /
shall ye find / the which very moderately take in good worth the death of
their children? This matter is so plain / that there needs no great help of
philosophy thereto. For he that would consider well in his mide / how wretched
on al sides this our life is / to how many pills / to how many sickenessis / to
how many chau^ces / to how many cares / to how many inco^modities / to how
many vices / and to how many injuries it is endangered: how littell and how
small a portion thereof we pass forth (I will not say in pleasure) that is not
attached with some manner greffe and displeasure? and than farther to consider
how sweftely it vanissheth and rolleth away / that we may in manner rejoice and
be glad of them that been departed out of this world in their youth.

The shortness of our life Euripides sadly expresses / which callethe the life
of mortal creatures one little day. But Phalereus Demetrius does better /
which correctynge the saying of Euripides says / that the life of man should
rather be called the Minute of an hour. But Pyndarus says best of all /
which callethe the life of man the dreme of a shadow. He ioynethe two
special things of nothing to gether / to thentent that he would declare how
vain a thing this life is. Now how wretched and miserable the same life is
on every behalf / the aun cient poets seemed to perceive it passinge well: the
which demed / that a man could not more truly nor more better name mortal
creatures / than surname them very miserable wretches. For the first age or
formeste part of man's life (the which is rekened the best) is ignorant: The
middell part of the life is assailed with trouble and care of manyfolde
businessis: and yet all this while I speak but of them that be most luckye
and fortunate. Therefore who is he / which of very right will not approve the
saying of Silenus: the best is never to be borne / the next is most swyftly
to be clean extincte?

who will not allow the ordinance of the Thraciens / the which customa bly
use to receive them that be borne in to this world / with lamentation and
mourning: and again when they depart hence / they be very glad and demean
great joy? And he that by him self considerethe inwardlye those things /
that Hegesias was wont to declare to his herers / he would rather desire his
own death than abhor hit: and would far more indifferently take in worth
the death of his friends. But now your fatherly sorrow co^methe forth and
says: He died er his day / he dyed in his childehode / he died so passing a
good child / yea and so towardlye disposed unto virtue / that he was worthy
to have lived many many years: your fatherly forowe co^playneth / that the
course of Nature is subverted / saying that you his father an old man / should
over live your son a young man. But I prey you for the love of god tell me /
what ye call before his day: as though every day of a man's life could not be
his last day? One before he come in to this world / and wha^ uneath it has
any shappe of a creature reasonable* is strangled and diethe / even under the
hands of nature workynge and fourmynge of it. An other diethe in the birth.
An other crienge in the cradell is snatched away by death. An other in the
flowrig youth dies / when scarsely as yet it has any taste of the life. Of so
many thousands of people / to how few is it given (as Horace names it) to
step up on the gryce of old age? without doubt god has under such a law
constituted the soul in the garrison of this littell body / that what so ever
day / or what so ever moment he will command it to depart thence / it must
by and by needs go. Nor there is none that can of right think him self to be
called forth before his day / co^siderynge that there is no man that has a
day certain to him appointed: but that only is his laufull day / which so
ever he our sovereign captain would should be his last day. If we will work
wisely / we should so abide every day / as it were our very last. I prey you /
what makes hit matter / saying the life is so short and fugitive / whether we
dye betymes / or tarry some what longer. For it skylleth no more tha^ it does /
when many be brought to execution / which of them should be first heeded or
hanged: It is all one / which is the first / the third or the eight. And
what other thing else is the life it self / but a certain perpetual course
unto death? Saving that their chance is more commodious / the which from so
laborious an exercise of the life are dispatched be times. But as it is a
touch of a braynles fellow to depart away from the army and break the array /
without the capitaynes commandment: So hit is a foliss he point and great
ingratitude / when leave is quickelye given of the captain / not gladly to
take it: And most specially / if he that has now license to go / may deperte
his way home with laud and preyse / and to him no rebuke nor shame. Nor it is
not convenient / that one should sit and reken how many years he has lived.
The age should be esteemed according to the noble deeds: And he (as Homere
says) is not reputed to have lived / that has poystered the earth / and made
a nombre: but he the which sad and sobrely passing forth his life / leaves
behind him an honest remembrance to them that come after.

Do ye complain / that god sent you forthwith such a child / as ye would
desire to have had many years to come? what / pardie your son died not so
soon / he was now come to the age of.xx. years: at the which age (after mine
opinion) it is best for to die / for so much as than life is most sweet.
Now was he to his country very bountiful / now was he to his father very
lowely and gentle / now was he among his fellows a very merye companion /
and now had he a good and a perfect mind to godwarde. He decessed ignorant
of vicis / and when he had not tasted but littell of the calamities and
miseries of this world. But what be should have known and have felt (if he
had lived longer) it is uncertain. No doubt we se very often times / that the
latter age does both infecte the clean conversation of young age with more
grievous vices / and spottethe and defiles the felicity of youth / with
manyfolde miserable grefes. From all these iuels and perils / death quickly
withdrewe him. Now may you safe and surely rejoice and be glad / that you have
had so good and so virtuous a son / ye or rather have. But be it (as you do
suppose) that you had him / and that now ye be deprived and have lost him.
whether of very right ought you rather to tourment and vex your self for
that ye have forgone him: or else rejoice and be glad that ye had such a
son? Take you head that it be not a point of unkindness / that ye should
remember the request of the gift to be restored again / and nothing to
mind the gift. No doubt a child of a good disposition is a great gift: but
yet is he so given / that ye should take and have pleasure with him for a time
/ and not that he should be yours for ever. You that be a perfect wise man /
consider this by your self: yea let us both to gether consider on this wise.

If a great prince should lend us a tabull of an excedyng great price / and of
an excellent workemanshyppe / to pass our time with: whether ought we (when so
ever pleasethe him to demand or call for it) with a glad chere / ye and more
over gentylly tha^kynge him / to deliver it again / or else with heavy and
sorrowful countenance shall we complain to him on this wise? O cruel prince /
of how precious a gift haste thou spoiled us? How great a pleasure have thou
berafte and taken from us? How sone have thou taken from us / contrary to our
opinion this so excellent a thing. Might not he of very right to our so
unkind complayntes answer on this wise? Have I this reward for my gentle
and courtoys deed? Remember ye nothing / save only that / that ye have forgone
the most fair tabull? Have ye forgotte / that I of mine own good will and
frelye lent it you? And that ye have now so long while (of my gentylnes and
sufferaunce) fed your eyes and delited your mind. It was of my liberalite
and fredome that I le^te it you: and now when I require it again I do but
right: perdie ye have had by me some advantage / ye lost nothing / save that
through your folly / ye femed that thing to be your own / that was but lent
you. And so ye esteem it to be lost / that is restored to the owner again.
But the more precious and delectable that the thing was that I lent and let
you have at your pleasure / the more a great deal ye ought to have thanked
me. Nor ye ought not to think hit to be to sone required again / the which
with out any iniurye or wrong might have been kept from you.

If this reason can not be proved false by no mean of argumentation: tha^
think how much more justly Nature (with such manner words) might reprove
both our lamentation and sorrowful complaynynges. And undoubted by these manner
of reasons our sorrow ought to be swaged / yea if it were so / that a man were
utterly extincte by death / and there remained nothing of us after the burial.

Now if we at the least give crede^ce to it / whereof Socrates in Plato /
doubted nothing at all / that is to wit: the very man to be the soul / and
this body to be nothing else but the pipe or little house of the soul: Or else
to say truth / it may be called the burial or prison of the soul: and when
it escapes out thereof / than at the last it comes to liberty to live much
more welthyly than it did be fore. wherefore than should we sorowfully blame death
/ saying that he that dies / does not perisshe / but than he semethe rather
to be borne. And we ought to rejoice in the soul (which we can not with our
eyes decerne) as much and none other wise / than we be wont to rejoice and
take pleasure in our friends that been absent. And I doubt whether is more
delectable and reioysyng to us / when they been present / or else when they ben
absent: for so much as the corporal living to gether is wont to mynyster to
us matter of displeasure / and the much being in company to gether does some
what abate the ioyfulnesse of frendshyp. If ye desire an example of this thing
/ be not the apostels a sufficient argument / the which than began to take
very fruition in Christ / and truly to love him / after the corporal presence
was taken from them? On the same wise is the fre^dshyppe of them that be good /
the which steadfastly persevere in couplynge and knyttynge to gether of the
minds / and not of the bodies. And there is no violence / no space of time /
nor no distaunce of places / that can sever or divide the couplyng of minds.
So that me think hit a very childisshe point / to think that a friend were
clean lost and gone / so sone as he were out of sight. You may (as often as ye
will) have your son present / both in your thought and in your words: And
he (on the other side) reme^breth you / and perceives the tender affections of
your mind / ye and other while in your sleep both your souls e^brace each
other / and talk to gether of some secret things. what thing lets / that
ye may not even very now imagine to live with him / with whom soon after ye
are in point to live? I pray you / how brief and short is all the holle time
that we live here?

Hitherto have I used the remedies / the which I might well use / if I had to
do with a paynym. Now let us brieffely consider / what godlynes and christen
faith ought to require of us.

First and foremost / if it were so / that death were a thing most miserable:
yet it behooves us to take it in good worth / saying that there is none other
remedy. And more over / if death should clean extinguishe man / that nothing
after should remain: yet we should there with be content / for as much as
hit makethe an end of many calamities and greffes / which we suffer in this
life. But saying that death delyuereth the soul (being of etheriall
beginning) out of the dongion of the ponderous and beuy body: in a manner we
ought to rejoice and be glad of them that be departed hence out of this
wretched world: and that they be returned home again to that welthye
liberty / from whence they came. Now than co^side ryng that death (without any
doubt) conueyeth the good devout souls out of the storms of this troublous
life unto the port or haven of life perdurable / and that not so much as a
here of a man's heed shall perisshe (for the bodies also at length shall be called
to enjoy the same life everlasting.) I prey you whether ought we to mourn and
weep / or else to be glad and rejoice in him / whom death in due time takes
out of this most troublous see of the life / and carries him in to that quiet
and sure resting place of everlasting life? Go to now a littell while / and
lay to gether the foul enormities / the painful labors / and the perils and
dangers of this life (if it may be called a life.) And on the other side reken
and cast what commodities and pleasures (of that other life) are all ready
prepared for the godly creatures that be plucked hence away: And than ye shall
sone perceive / that no man can do more vnrightouslye than he / the which
lamentably bewayleth / that high goodness / unto the which only we be both
borne and ordained / even as though it were a right great and grievous harm.
Ye cry out / because ye be left comfortles alone without children / when ye
have begotte a son to inhabit heaven: the holy remembrance of whom (as it
were of a divine thing) ye may reverence / the which above in beue^ being
careful for you / may greatly forther the prosperous success of your business
here. For he is another ignorant of mortal folks business / nor has not
forgone with the body the lowlye reverence and tender love / which he was
wo^te to bear to you his father. No doubt he lives / believe me he lives / and
perauenture is present with us / and hereth / and perceives this our
communication / and laugheth and damneth this our lame^tation. And if the
grossenes of our bodies let not / perchance we should here him blaming us
for our weeping with these manner of words. what do ye? will ye abridge your
days / and finishe your old age with this unprofitable / ye I may well say
pyuisshe lamentation? wherefore do you with so unjust com playntes accuse and
blame destenyefortune and death? Have you envy at me because I am delivered
from the yuels of that life / and am brought to this felicity that I am in?
But be hit / that your fatherly goodness and pure amity does not envy me. Yet
what other thing means this sorrowful complaynyng? Think you this worthy
to be lamented / that I am deducte and brought from thraldom to liberty /
from pain and care to pleasure and felicity / from darkness unto light /
from peril and danger unto sure saftie / from death unto life / from
sickenessis and disseases unto im mortality / from so many yuels to so high
goodness / from things caduke and transitory to the everlasting / fro things
erthly to celestial / and finally from the corrupt and unclean company of all
people to the fellowship of angels? Tell me (I prey you) for the great love and
kyndnes that ye bear me / If it lay in your power to releue me again / would
ye releue me? Than what offense have I done / to deserve so great hatred of
you? If ye would not reliue me again / than for what purpose seruen all these
lame^tatio^s / the which (as I have said) are not only unprofitable / but also
un godly? But ne were it so / that immortalite had a while agone clean depued
me of all sorrow / I would like wise with weeping tears bewail your so rowfull
mourning / and sore have rewed upon thilke gross and dark cloudines of your
mind. But ye say / that you on your part weep and make lame^tatio^. For soth
therein ye do not like lovers: but like unto the^ that have a respect to them
selfewarde / and that will (to others disco^modite) se to their own bu sines.
Now go to / tell me / what loss is it / that ye sustain by my death? Is it /
because ye can not have me in your sight? Pardie ye may never the less / at
your own pleasure remember me the mean time / ye and so much the more
welthyly / in how much I am in sure saftie. For look that ye esteem me now
delivered from all the yuels / what so ever they be that may bechaunce a
mortal man in his life: of which your long and robustous life (for a great
part) has experience. And though that I be not with you / with lowly
obeisa^ce to do you service / yet may I be a sure and an effectual advocate
for you before the high majesty of god. And finally / how small a thing is
hit / that deuideth our conversation and familiarity? Now look that you so
endeavor your self / that when ye have well and vertuouslye passed the course
of your life / that ye may than at the hour of death be found worthy to be
conveyed hither.

If that your son (I say) should say these words to us: might we not well
be ashamed thus to lament and mourn as we do?

with these manner of reasons I am wont to ease the greffe of mine own mind:
of the which I would that you should be part taker / not all only that ye have
any great need of those remedies: but I demed it agreeable / that ye should be
partaker of my consolation / of whose sorrow I was partiner. But briefly to
conclude all that has been at length reasoned: by this manner mean / ye shall
aswage the smartynge sorrow of your mind.

My son is deed: ye begotte a mortal creature. I have lost a great jewel:
ye have yielded hit again to him that frelye gave hit you. It is a right
grievous thing to be thus destitude: It should be the lighter borne / that may
be redressed by some mean. He has left me his father alone co^fortles. what
does it avail to weep and wayle for that that can not be remedied? or why
mourn you for that / the which chances to so many thousands as well as to
you? Alas I can not chose but weep for the death of my son: ye but he that
diethe well / does in no wise perysshe. But he died to sone: He that diethe
well / diethe not to sone. He dyed long before his day was come: There is no
man that has a day certain appointed unto him. He decessed in his flourynge
youth: It is than best to dye when to live it is most sweet. He died a very
young man: So is he withdrawn from the mo yuels and troubuls of this life. I
have lost the best child that any man could have: Be glad that ye had
such one. He departed out of this world an innocent: No death should be more
desired and less bewailed. Ye but it is not lefull for me the mean while to
have fruition with my son: Yes in your mind you may: and within short space
you and he to gether body and soul shall joy and take pleasure. If ye know
any better remedies than these / of gentylnes let me here them: if ye do not /
