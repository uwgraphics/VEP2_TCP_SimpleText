THE Three first BOOKS OF Ovid de Tristibus Translated into English.

IMPRINTED at London in Fleetestrete, near unto Saint Dunstones Church, by
Thomas Marsh. 1580. Cum Priuilegio.

The occasion of this Book.
OF Ouidius Naso his banishment, diverse occasions be supposed: but the common
opinion and the most likely is, that Augustus Caesar the^ Em perour, reading
his Books of the Art of Love, misliked the^ so much, that he condemned Ovid
to exile. After which time the said Ovid as well in his passage on the Sea, as
after arrived in the Barbarous countries, the rather to recover the Emperors
grace, wrote these Elegies, or Lamentable verses, directing some to the Gods,
some to Caesar, some to his wife, some to his Daughter, some to his Friends,
some to his foes, etc. And called this book, the book of Sorrows: In latin de
Tristibus.

TO HIS MOST ASSVred and tried Friend Master Christopher Hatton Esquire,
Thomas Churchyard wysheth continuance of Virtue.
AS I have great desire to perform my promise touching my whole works of
English Verses, good master Hatton, so I wish my self able every way to
keep the worthiness of your Friendship, which many have tasted, and few can
find fault withal: such is the eeue^nesse of your dealinges, and the upright
behavior of the same. Well, least I should seem to unfold a fardle of
Flattrie, I return to my matter My book being vnreadye, considering I was
commanded (by a great and mighty parsonage) to write ye same again, I am
forced in the mean while to occupy your judgment with the reading of another
man's work, whose doings of it self, are sufficient to purchase good report,
albeit it wanted such a Patron as you are to defend it. The rest of that
work which as yet is not come forth, I purpose to pen and set out, craving a
little leisure for the same. And surely sir, I blush that mine own book bears
not a better Title, but the baseness of the matter will not suffer it to bear
any higher name, than Churchyardes Chyps: for in the same are sundry tryfles
composed in my youth, and such fruicte as those days and my simple knowledge
could yield, so that the aptest name for such stuff, was as I thought, to
give my works this Title, to be called Churchyardes Chips (to warm the wits
of his welwillers.) In my first book shall be three Tragedies, two tales, a
Dream, a description of Friendship, a Farewell to the Court, the siege of Leeth
and sundry other things yt are already written. And in my second Book shall be
four Tragedies, ten Tales, the Siege of Saint Quintaynes, Newhauen, Calleis,
and Guynes, and I hope the rest of all the sorrein wars, that I have seen or
heard of abroad, shall follow in another volume.

Thus commending this little present to your consideration, I trouble you not
long with the tediousnes of my Epistle, and wishing you much worship, good
^ame and blessed fortune, I bydde you most heartily farewell.

Yours in all at commandment. Thomas Churchyard.

Ovid to his Book.
The Elegy first.
MY little book (I blame thee not) to stately town s^all go.
O cruel chance, y^ where thou go, thy master may not so.
Go now thy way: yet suit thy self, in sad and simple gear,
Such exiles weed as time require, I will y^ thou do wear.
No vastie Uiolet shall thou use, nor robe of Purple hue,
Those costly colors be vns^t, our careful cause to ^ue.
With ruddy red dye not thy face, nor sap of Ceder tree,
Such outward hu^ see that thou have, as cause assigns to thee.
Frounce not thy fearful face I say, nor hapless head to streke,
But roughe and rugde so show in sight that pity may provoke.
Those subtle sleights be much more meet, for volumes void of pain
But thou of my unfriendly fate a myrror must remain.
Be not abasht thy ruefull blots, to set and show in sight,
That of my tears men may them judge, to have been made a right.
Depart thy way and in my name, salute those blessed bowers,
When as thy fearful foot shall fall, in Caesar's stately towers.
If any be (as some there are) amongst the rural route,
Forgetlesse friends shall ask for me, or ought shall seem to doubt.
Say that I live: which as I do, by force of heavenly might,
So do confess my troubled state, wherein thou sees me plight:
If further speech shall thee provoke, or other skill they crave,
I charge thee then to take good heed: no wastfull words to have.
My faulty facts if any shall, reprove perhaps to thee,
Or doleful deeds in public place condemned chance to be^.
Spend thou no speech, nor do not care, tho threatening brows they be^de,
A rightful cause it hinders often, with words if we defend.
Some shall thou find that will bewail, me thus in exile sent,
And reading thee with trickling tears, my careful case lament.
And in their muttring minds will wish (least wicked men may hear)
That Caesar's ire once set a side, from pains I may be clear.
To such therefore as well do wish, to us that pain do prove,
To mighty Jove we pray likewise, like sorrows to remove.
All things thus stand in quiet state, and Caesar's grace once won,
Does wish my loathsome life to end, where life I first begone.
A work unworthy of my wit, of thee some men will judge.
And doing that I thee require, at thee likewise shall grudge.
Yet ought a Judge as well to time* as matte^ have regard.
Which if ye have (as I do hope) thou sasely shall be hard.
For pleasant berses do proceed, from quiet resting brain,
But soden sorrows me assaults, with hugie heaps of ^ayne.
A time of trouble void it craves, a perfect verse to make,
But me: the Seas, the wrest^yng wyndes, the winter wyld does shake*
A mind more free from fear it asks, in deadly doubt I stand,
Least that my life with sword be reft, by force of enemies hand.
Yet some there are that maru^ile will, and rightful Judges be,
When they this mean and simple verse, with equal eyes shall see.
For though that Homer yet did live, with sorrows so be set,
His wonted wits through malice might, I fear he should forget.
Yet show thy self (my seely book) without regard of fame,
Nor though percase thou do displease, let it not thee ashame.
Sith fortune so unfriendly is to hope it were in vain,
That thou thereby should purchase praise to make thereof thy gain.
While fortune smyld with smirking chere of fame I had desire,
And noted name on every side, I sought for to acquyre
A feigned verse lo now I make, and hate my hurtful lore,
Let it suffice, since that my wit forsakes me therefore.
Yet go thou one and in my steed the royal Rome to see
God grant that there is none of mine, they may account of thee.
And though thou there a stranger be, think not unknown to come
But that amids the mighty town thou shall be known to some.
Thy color will disclose thy craft, although thou wear no name,
By deep deceit* or otherwise by skill to cloak the same.
In privy wise yet pass thou in my verse may else offend,
The wonted grace it clearly wantes, which I to verse did lend.
To read as mine if any shall, unworthy therefore deem,
And from his hands to cast away to the by hap shall seem,
Tell then thy name: thou art not he of love that taught the lore,
That wicked work has felt the pains that it deserved before.
Perhaps thou lookst I should thee bid the palace proud to clyme,
Where Caesar royal court does keep with pleasant passed time.
Those princely places and eke Gods, of pardon to I crane
Since from the stately tops of them this lyghtning lo we have.
The time I may remember when those Gods more gentle wear,
Such now therefore as hurtful be by proof of pain I fear.
The sely Dove that once was nymd, with goshauk^s gredy nype,
Does dread the smallest glympes of her, to fly her grievous gripe.
The wandering lamb yt worewing wolf, had caught by courage boulde,
Escapyng then his cruel chaps does sleep in shepherds fould.
Yea Phaeton would shun the skyee, if he again did rain,
And hate the horses whom he lou'de for fear of former paynt,
My self confess that have receyu'de of l^ue his lance a wound*
Do fear the force of flashing fire, by thonders threatening sound.
Who so Caphatea sekes to shun in way from Grecian fleet,
That he always from Ebo^ke Seas, to turn his stern is meet
My ship that lately did escape, with sturdy storm a clappe
In that fame place does hate to come, for fear of like mishap*
My book therefore beware and stand, with fearful mind in doubt.,
And be content that thou be red in private place about.
While Icarus with tender wings did clyme the starry sky,
In surging Seas he fell adowne. which have their name thereby
The Ower or the sails to use, herein to know is hard,
But time and cause shall counsel thee, if thou thereto regard.
An idle time if thou espy, when ceased is debate,
And when all ire is pacifyed, and turned to friendly state.
Some doubting thus with fearful face will thee perhaps present,
So he with words thy way have made, then go where thou art sent.
More happy hap god grant thou have, and far more lucky day,
Then I have had, when thou come there, our sorrows to allay.
For he alone can salve my sore: of whom the wound I have.
And hurt and heal by self same skill, Achilles lately gave.
Take heed while help herein thou seek, thereby no hurt arise,
For fear does far surmount our hope, thy self therefore advise.
In minds to quiet bent, renew not wrath again,
Least thou unawares may kindle cooles, to double former pain.
Yet when unto my homly house, thou shall return to me,
And in thy crooked shryne be set, a place made meet for thee.
Thy brethren there thou shall behold, in order seemly set,
One only father all they had, whom he by skill beget.
The rest that therein sight do show by signs thou may decerne,
Whose names be set amids their brows, that thou thereof may learn.
And also three in privy place, do lurk in darkesome den,
Of love the crafty skill they teach, as it is known to men.
Those wicked wightes thou shall eschew, or if thou may proclayme,
For such as fathers lately slew, by Telogonian name,
These three I warn thee of, if thou (the father not disdain,
Of love although the way they teach, to love yet thou refrain.
And fifteen volumes more in verse, of changed bodies be^,
Which at my funeralles I had, and there bereft from me.
Among the which transformed shapes, say thou that I do crave,
That my misfortune may be set, with them a place to have.
Unlikely to her former hests, her altring wondrous strange,
For now she weeps ye whilom smilde, as chance of time does chan^ge
More matter yet (if thou had askte) I had to tell beside,
But that I fear it might be cause* to long that thou abide.
For if nothing that comes to mind, from thee I should detayne.
A burden far more huge thou were, then bearers could sustain.
Long is thy way therefore make have, for we shall now abide,
In furthest Coast of all the earth far from our country wide.
To the Gods. The Elegy second.
O Gods of Seas and Sky, for what save (prayers may prevail)
Do not destroy our shaken ships, in surging Seas to sail.
Nor do you not to Caesar's wrath, with whole assent resort,
For him whom one God does oppress, an other may support.
Though Vulcane stood adverse to Troy, Apollo sought relief,
And Venus was to Troyans just, though Pallas wrought their grief.
So Iu^o did Aeneas hate, who Turnus held full dear,
Yet he through help of Venus power, from harm was saved clear.
The fearce Neptunus often did seek, to short Ulysses days.
Yet from her Eme Minerua did, his life preserve always.
And though we far inferior be, in heavenly force and might,
A f^endly God yet who forbids, an angry God to spite.
But wastefull words (O wretch) I spend, no good thereby arise.
Save that it makes the watery waves, to spring from speakers eyes.
My paynfull speech and prayers pressed, the Southren wynd has rent.
And suffers not that they do come, to Gods where they be sent.
With one alonely cause therefore least I be hurt, should deem
Both ships and vows I know not where, to bear away they seem
What boisterous billows now (O wretch) amids the waves we spy,
As I forthwith should have been heu'de to touch the Azure sky.
What vacant valleys be there set, in swallowing S^as so wrought,
As presently thou looks I should, to drery hell be brought.
I tookt about: save Seas and sky, naught subject was to sight,
With swelling surges one, with clouds, the other threatened spite.
Between them both with whis^yng sound, the whyrling wynds do rend
And foming Seas to Weather God, do stand in doubt to bend,
Now does sir Eurus winds take force at rise of mourning bright,
Now Zephirus is pressed at hand, to wayghte the darksome night.
Now Boreas with parching vrye, from Northren Pole does glide,
Now Notus so with ^eare of flyet, does put his ^orce assyde.
The Guide himself in doubtful muse, what he may fly does crave,
Astonished stays his wonted skill from wrack the ship to save.
We dye therefore, no hope at all of life their does remayn.
While thus I speak the bitter tears, my fearful face distayn.
The floods my mind oppressed while thus, in vain we prayed alas,
And by our careful mouth adowne, the deadly drops do pas.
My godly wife it only greues, in exile I am sent,
This one mish^p alone she knows* for this she does lament.
In largest seas how I am cest, to her no fear does seem,
Nor tos^ with wyndes she knows not, nor death so nere does deem.
O happy yet I did her leave, and so my self auys^
For else (pore wretch) my pain were more, then death have suffered ^wise
But though that I do perish quite, s^th she in life remain,
I think thereby my days to length and h^lfe a life to gain.
What flames alas with swift recourse, from scowling clouds do light
What cruel crashing noise do sound, from axe in heaven on hight,
No lighter blows our ship do bear by surges waygh^y gush,
Then lofty walls when they sust^yne, the cannons cruel rushe,
This raging flood which hence do come, in force all fluds surmount,
Behynd the ny^th before the le^enth, in sight we my account.
For death I fear though this do sceme, a wretched death to be,
Set wrack aside, a gift it is, a welcome guest to me,
Somewhat it is for such as are, by sword or fa^e decayed,
That dying so in moldy earth, their liueles corpse be laid.
Their faythf^l friends they may exhort, and gladsome gr^ue obtain,
And not in Seas to have been stroyd, and fishes ^ood be sla^ne.
Admit I do deserve such death, alone I am not hear.
Why should my gri^^e pr^cure these pains whose factes from ^^ults be clear
O Saints above and g^ds so great, which rule ^he wate^s al,
Of either sort more ^eker be, and threatening bro^^s let fall.
So life which Cesars gentle wrath, has (...) to pass alive,
Herewith I man (if you let not) at poynted place ariue.
If any pain I have deseru'de, have (...) my death decreede?
My fault at all no (...) deseru^^, the (...) himself agreed.
If Caesar would ^aue sent me do^ne to swim in Sti^ian l^ke,
No help of you for that he needs nor p^ynes therein should take.
No such envy he does pretend nor, longs so for blood,
Since that he gave and may receive, when he so thinks it good.
And you therefore we humblye pray, s^th ye no harm sustain,
Indifferent minds herein to have, and not increase our pain.
For though you would with wh^le assent, my wretched body save,
Think you by that for dampened soul a help hereafter have?
Though ^eas were call ^e, though winds were still, and you O Gods content,
Yet a a^exilde I should remain, by Caesar's own assent.
I do not seek for greedy gain* by marchantes crafty s^ill.
Whereby I should occas^on have the surging seas to till
Nor Athens ^oe I look to see, where I have sought for sore,
Nor Asia mighty towns to view, not seen to me before.
Nor yet to Alexandria cost, I would conuayed be,
That there I might O Nil^s rest, thy pleasures there to see.
The wyndes I wish (who would believe) my ship in have to drive.
Unto S^rmatia famous land, that there it might aryue.
As I am bound even so I would, to Pontus haven attain,
And leaving thus my country dear my slow success I plain.
Nor know not in what coast to find, the town that Tomos hight
And by my paynefull prayers so, I take my fearful flight.
If me you love then do I crave your swellyng floods to tame,
And by your heavenly power permit our ships may sail the same.
Or if you hate, compel me then to poynted place to fly,
A part of pain I think it is, in strangers ground to dye.
Now hal^ away you ^o^sterous winds, why do we here abide?
And by Italia shore in sight what causes us to ride?
Since Caesar has decreede my flight, will you thereto deny.
Wherefore permit my eyes may come, where Pontus they may spy.
Thus has he iudgd, thus I deserve, nor what he does reprove,
By right or law to ^end my fault, it may not me behoue.
If doleful deeds of mortal men, to Gods be not unknown,
Then may you see not my offense, of wicked mind is grown.
But if such ^^il they have, and I by error so distraught,
My mind with ignorance and not, with wickedness was fraught.
If any love to Caesar's house, we simple men do bear,
His public hestes it shall suffice, that we do dread and fear.
If I have told of happy days, wherein that he did rain,
To Caesar and Cesarians all, have (...) my busy pain.
If I such faithful mind have had, so grant (O Gods) relief,
If not to dround in Seas I wish and end my weary grief.
But am I now deceived? or do the scowling clouds wax fair,
Or do the billows break in sight? or calm to seas repair
No chance but cause have cal'de you here, your aid we pray to lend,
Sith you no fraud or craft may blind, for help we do attend.
He departs from Rome, remembers the tears of his Wife, and friends.
Elegy. 3.
WHen I the pensive picture see, of darcke and drery night,
And in my mind behold the town, from whence I took my flight.
Or time record, when I did leave* my friends and dear allies,
Then do the doleful drops descend, from my sad weeping eyes.
The day drue on I should depart, as Caesar wild before,
And flee a far to parts extreme, and shun Italia shore.
No time or perfect space I had, nor mind for prayer pressed,
And drowsines by long delay, had crept in careful breast.
No men there were to weight on me, no care I had to reed,
No garments meet for mine estate, nor wealth to serve my need,
I was astoyn'de: as he that feels the force of lightning flame,
Who thinckes he were of life bereft, and yet enioyes the same,
But when this cloud of mind was gone, by sorrow set aside,
And that my senses did return, in former health to bide,
At last my sorry friends I spoke, when I away did pas,
Which of a number that I had, but one or two there was.
My loving wife all weeping thus, me weeping did sustain,
Till that by her unworthy cheeks, a shoure of tears did rain,
My daughter dear was far away, in coast of Libia land,
And of my fate no word she knew, nor cause could understand.
A yelling and a crying noise did sound on every side,
No secret form of funeral, within my house did bide.
The man the Wife, the blameless babe, my doleful death do ^ue,
In every corner of my house, a stream of tears there give.
If we doubt not our matters small, by greater things make plain,
As Troy when it was taken, so we in like estate remain.
Now whisted was the voice of men, of dogs and every wight,
And Cynthea led the horses then, that rul'de the darckesome night.
I lookinge up, did cast mine eyes, the Senate house to see,
Which next our careful cot in vain, was built in good degree.
And said (O Gods) that here do rest, and nearest neighbors be,
O stately Temples whom mine eyes, henceforth shall never see.
And you O heavenly goasts I leave, in lofty Rome to dwell.
For ever here I take my leave, and bid you all farewell.
But though that after g^euous wounds, my shield to late I have,
Yet do vouchsafe my fearful flight, from hurtful hate to save.
And say unto this heavenly man: by error I did fall,
Least wickedness ^ay else be though^ to have been mixed withal,
(...) that which you do all perceive, let him perceive the same,
That Gods once pe^sde, I may be sure, to have no wretches name.
These paynful prayers have I made the mighty Gods, unto
My wife with more while sobbing sighs, her words have let so.
Before the doors with hayres he spread, she prostrate ^o did lie,
And with her mouth the (...), that builded are thereby.
Full many helples words she spoke to adverse houses than,
Which naught at al for me preu^^ld, that was condemned man.
The hastyng night now drew away, nor longer space would grant
W^erw^th the star^es did turn one axe, the darksome night to daun^
What might I do as loath I was to leave my country dear,
So was the poynted night now come, and almost passed clear.
How often cride I to such as then, my long delay controld.
Why force you me? why have ^ou so? whence go we now? behold
How often have I faynde like w^se, a certain hour to have,
Which for my journey were more fyt, and me from danger save.
The threshold thryse I ki^t, an^ ^hryse I was calde back I trow,
M^ mind was dull and made no have, my feet in flight were slow.
O^t t^mes I said farewell, and yet, for which I speak and plain,
(...) then as parting I returned to kiss my friends again.
Often times the same precepts I gave, and being yet begylde.
I l^ked back and cast mine (...), to see my seely child.
In fine: what have, to Sci^hea now it is that we are sent,
And Rome we leave, yet both delays, be done of just intent.
My wife although she live I loose, I yet do live likewise
With house and members sweet thereof, which I cannot despise.
My faithful fellows eke whom I* as brethren did esteem,
Whose fastened faith as true to me, O These^n mates I deem.
Them there in arms I did embrace, which never more I might,
Each hour a grateful gain I ^hought, that given me was that night.
N^ more delay I made but left my talk imper^^t there,
All things that I should then have said, in mind recorded nere.
W^yle we our sorry spech did spend, and while we weped thus,
The day star began appear on sky, a heavy star to us.
W^erwith a pain I felt, as though my members have forlorn,
And from my body every part, did se u^ to have been torn.
I plainde as Pri^m whi^om did, when he the treason knew,
And saw his foes from horse to slip. ^hen ^roian mates they slew.
A common cry did th^n arise, my (...) c^ri^g (...),
Their careful brea^t^s of cl^^^ing b^^e, (...) hea^y h^^ds they struck.
D^p^rting then: to shoulders fast, my (...) clea^^e afraid,
And with my t^ares her words ^hee mixed, and thus eu^^ t^en she said.
Thou shall not go together us, to flee they shall constrayne,
I follow thee, of exiles wife, ^n exile will rem^yne.
The way is made for me, and I, the fa^the^t land will see,
And to your passing ships I shall, a sle^der burden be.
Caesar's wrath comm^^ndeth you our country ^^are to flee,
B^t love, this godly zealous lou^, shall Caesar g^^^ to me.
Li^e helpelesse things she did assay, as often ^hee did before,
And skant her weary hands she (...), her pro^^^ to restore.
A coming forth as one that were, depriude of rightful gra^e,
A nasty skin, and hanging ^eare, a coming ^outh I have.
Some say that she with sorro^es great, a^ end of darkesome nig^t.
A^ids the house i^ frantike mood, did cast her se^fe in sight.
And that at length ^h^e rose again, her hayres in dust arayde.
And members cold from ground ^hee hea^de, as one right sore afraid*
Sometimes her self, so^etimes her house, she does bewail with^^l,
And to her husband absent then, full o^t by name she call.
No less she weeped there then if, her w^full eyes should spy.
M^ daughter or my self made m^^te, on burning co^les to lie.
Such care she had her death to have, and leave her living sense,
Yet none it were respecting mine, though ^hee so passed hence.
But now God grant that she do live, ^^th fates do so decree,
That by her helping hand I may, the more relieved be.
Boote^ now which keeps the bear, of Erymanthus wood,
In Ocean Sea is dyued low, whose star does stir the flood*
Yet sail we not in Ionian Seas, for that we so do crave,
But are compeld by present fear, more boldness there to have.
Lo now (O wretch) ye Seas wax black, the boisterous winds do beat,
And sands that from the depth ^e drawn, do burn with ^owly heat.
Our ships with waves no less then hills, is ^ossed to and fro,
Our painted Gods with billows bet, their quiet state forgo.
The slender s^des do cry and sound, with stresse the cables crack,
The ship it self with our i^l hap, a fearful groaning make.
The master by his pale aspecte, bewrayes his secret fer^,
And ouercomde pursues the wippe, by ^^il rules not the s^ere.
Like as the fearful ryder does let slip the horses reane.
Who yeldeth to his careless will and a^t forgett^h clea^e.
Even so not where he would, but where the forcing water drive,
The sail I see he lets at large, in washing waves to diue.
That if sir Acolus, had not sent his changed wyndes abroad,
I surely had or this been blown, to place that was forbode.
For far from Liria coast to then, on left side fast at hand,
The interdicted place we saw, and spide Italia land.
But let the foming se^s (we pray (forbidden shore to seek.
That they with me the Gods obaye, and show themselu^s more meek.
While speaking thus we prayde and feared to have been drive abacke*
Wi^h wondrous force of sturdy waves our ship sides lo did crack.
O mighty Gods of ma^ble seas let not your tree arise,
That Jove himsele with me be wroth, we creue it may suffice.
And do you not my weary mind with cruel death constrayn,
If he that death has suffered once, cannot ^e^ar^ ag^yn.
To his constant friend. Elegy. 4.
O Friend whom first among my mates as chief in mind I deem,
O thou that do my heavy fate, even as thine ownee^^eeme,
That first relieved me I mean, amazed where I lay*
And bouldest were with willing mouth comforting words to say.
Which gently gave me counsel then, to live and len^^h my days,
When love of death in careful breast, had crept by sundry ways.
Thou know to whom I speak although thy name in signs I set,
Thy duty and thy friendly care, no whit I do forget.
In deepest depth of mind these things I printed haueful plain,
A debtor still of thine, I shall for evermore remain.
With wandryng winds this spirit of mine, shall pas away and flee,
And lastyng bones with flaming fire, shall quite consumed be.
Before that these thy good deserts shall escape my careful mind.
Or else this godly love with ^ime, from thence a ^ay s^al find.
Let mighty Gods now favor thee, that help thou need none crave,
And for^une far unlike to mine, God grant that thou may have*
Yet if the ship had safely sayld and friendly ^^ndes had blown.
This love and faithful friendship then, perhaps had not been known.
Peritheus did not account, Duke Theseu^ for his friend,
Til that for him to Stygian lake alive he did descend.
O restes so thy furyes fearceful pe^^^te trials be,
With how true heart that Pylades, was linkt in love to thee.
If that the stout Eurialus, with Butis had not fought,
Thy noble fame O Nisus then, had not been blown abought.
Like as the fine and perfect gould, in flaming fire is tryde,
Even so the love of friendship is in troublous time discride,
While fortune lust to smile and give, her helping hand withal,
And things to grounded wealth they have, that may thereto befall.
But when her threatening brows she bend, they shrink away and flee,
Where hugy heaps but lately were, not one now left we see.
This skilful red I learnd by ils, in other that did grow,
But now even of mine own mishaps, by proof the same I know.
Scant two or three my frende^ you are, that of my ^uth remain,
The rest as fortunes and not mine, I do account them plain,
You ^ew therefore do help our pain, that rest we may atchiue,
And that by you our shaken ships, in safer shore aryue.
With feigned fear be not afraid, a thing both fond and vain,
Least God misliking that your love, offended do remain.
For Caesar often in enemies does, his faithful friendship praise,
And that which in his own, in foes, he does approve a^wayes.
My cause yet better is, I have, no adverse armor worn,
My folly is the cause that I my country have forlorn.
With waking minds our heavy haps, do you bewail, and pray,
That Caesar's raging wrath the more, thereby may have delay,
Who so my cares does seek to know, in number them to have,
A thing more hard then may be done, he seems thereby to crave,
So many ils ^o have I borne, as stars in Azure sky,
And little graynes of flying dust, on parched ground do lie.
And many more of greater weight, we forced were to bear,
Which though they chaunst of credit yet, in them some doubt there were.
Some part whereof as does behoue, with me must die away,
And by my mean would God were none, that might the same bewray,
A persing speech although I had, a fyrme and flinty breast,
And greater store of mouths thereto, wherein more tounges did rest,
Yet all in words I do not know how I might comprehend,
The thing exceeding further then, my wits may well extend.
My troubles great ( O Poets lernde) for Duke Ulysses wright,
Yet I more (...) then he has borne, for truth you may endight.
In compass small he many years, was tossed up and down,
Between the Grecians noble land, and Trojans famous town.
But we the widest S^as have met, and wandered every ways,
To Geta crickes have driven been, and eke Sarmatia Bays,
A faithful hand Ulysses had, with mates both true and just,
But me my fellows fled in whom, I chiefly put my trust.
In merry mood as victor then, he went his land to see,
But I as victored do depart, and exile hence to flee.
In Greece ne yet Ithaca ground, nor Samia do I dwell,
From whence to be no pain it is, but may be suffered well.
But Rome which from the mountains seven, we there behold in sight,
The empire large and Gods thereof* lo thence I take my flight.
A body strong Ulysses had, that labor could sustain,
A small and slender corpse I have, with weak and tender brain.
To cruel wars and Marshall deeds has he been used always,
In quiet study have I dwelt, and lived all my days.
The greatest God oppresses me, to whom no God resort,
But Pallas him assisted still, and did his cause support.
Neptunus ire the God of Seas, have grieved him right sore,
But me Amighty Jove oppress, whose wrath reuengeth more.
The greatest part of his now be, for fables counted plain,
Of our mishaps no part at all for leesing do remain.
In fine, even as he did desire, at poynted place a^yue,
Which long he wished, right so he did, at length attain alive.
But I my country dear do think now never more to see.
Unless the ire of angry Gods, appeased hap to be.
To his wife Elegy. 5.
CAllimachus did not so burn, with love to Lyda lent,
Nor yet so sore Phila^es had, his heart on Ba^tis ben^,
As the (O mate most true) my breast within I depely grave,
Which worthy art a better not, but happier husband have,
I fall^ng fast by thee do hold, as by a booteful beam,
Thy gi^t it is, that I have escaped, apart of troubles stream.
Thou art the cause I am no pray, to such as seek to see,
The letters brought that might declare, the woeful wrack of me.
Like as the wolf that blood desires, when hunger hard does prick,
Of sely sheep that be unkept, the flesh full feign would ^ick,
Or as the greedy Grype upon, the careful corpse does stare,
When on the ground he sees it lie and left unburned bear.
So (...) I ^now not who, (...) hap did mistrust.
Upon (...) lets not his hands had laid ^niust.
But I (...) did withstand, by force of hendes full true,
To whom no ^han^e we render may, as to their deeds is due.
In careful c^se a witness true, thy deeds therefore does praise,
If witness do perchance prevail, in these our doleful days.
In virtuous life Andromacha, thy name does not distaine,
Nor Laodamia who did leave, her life with husband slain.
If Homer thou had hapt upon, thy fame should far exceed.
Above the chaste Penelopeis, of whom in him we read.
But if these manners meek the Gods, did geeue thee all untaught*
And in the day of blisfull birth, of nature thou them caught.
Or else the matrone most to praise, on whom thou waightest long,
A myrror did thee make to be, al honest wives among.
And to her self with custom long, has causde thee like to seem,
By greater things of matters small, we doubt not for to deem.
Full woe I am my verse has not, more force in such a case,
And that my tongue does not suffice, thy saythfull factes to blase.
For look what lively strents of mind, before in me there spronge,
Is quenched quite and fallen away, with sorrows sore and long:
The chief among the Ladies of, great fame tho^ might sit,
And of all men be lookte upon, for virtue, and for wit.
And so what power my pen may have, when verse I do indyte,
From time to time thou shall aye live, in verse that I can write.
To his friends that vvare his Image ingraude. Elegy. 6.
What friend thou be that Image have, in form made like to me,
No Garlands gay with Iuye wrought, about his head let be.
These happy signs most comely be, that pleasant Poets were,
My troublous time is far unfit the Laurel crown to bear.
And thou that bears about of me, in ringe the picture pressed,
Feign yt these things were never spoke, although thou knows the^ best.
The countenance dear of me, that am in exile sent, behold,
The likeness of my louring looks, which thou have graude in goulde.
Whereon when thou shall cast thine eyes, then happily thou may say,
How far from us is Naso now, our fellow sent away.
Thy love I well allow but yet, my verses print more plain
My form: which as they be, I ^id, to read do not dis^ayne.
My verse I say that does declare, how men strange shapes did shade,
Unhappy work whose master fled, and left vnperf^^ made.
The same with heavy hand full sad in flaming fire I thrust,
With much more of my grievous goods, when needs depart I must.
And as they say that Thestias, did burn with fatal fi^^,
Her son: and sister kineder was, then mother woude with ire.
So I my books my bowels dear, which no desert did s^ow,
To dye away with ^ee did then, in fles^^ng fl^m^^ bestow.
Which either was because my muse, as hurtful I did hate,
Or else for that my verse was rude and not in perfect state.
Which as they be not quite extinct, but partly yet appear
In volumes mo then one I think, that when they written were.
So now I wish them still remain, none y^le sloth that be,
The r^^der to delight but may, remember him of me.
But yet no man with pacient cares, to read them can abide,
Except he know that vncorrect, from me the some did slide.
That work was plucked away when half, he had his labor skant,
The trim^^ng trick that last should come, my wrttinges clerelye want.
For painted praise thy pardon crave, thy praise shall well suffice,
If thou that chance to read^ this book, my work do not despise,
And here also six verses have, which if thou think it best,
In foremost front of that my book, see that thou let them rest.
What ^an thou be these volumes touch, of father now bereft.
And leastwyse grant within your house a place for them be left.
And that thou should more favor them, of him they were not sent,
In public pre^se: but as it were the masters hearse of ren^e.
If that unlearned verse therefore, shall then show forth my crime,
The master would have mended it, if he had longer ^yme,
To his friend that br^ke his promise Elegy. 7.
THe fresh floods shall from S^^s re^yre, ^gayne their^ springes unto
So shall the Sun with horses ^urnde, his course r^uok^ also.
The ^arth shall ^ke the bright star bear, and air the plough s^al cleue,
The ^ater shall bring forth the flames, and fl^e shall water give
All things sh^l now by natu^es law, in order strange proc^de,
No pa^cell of this wandryng world, his way aright shall lead,
Al things s^al come to pass which I, deuyed before cold be,
For nothing is so strange to hear, bu^ we may hope to see
It s^all be so I guess because, of him I am reject,
Whose help I hoped now that should, my wo^ful cause protec^.
O faythl^s (...) how came so great forgetfuln^s of me
Why were thou then so sore, afraid, my careful corpse to see?
That o^ce again thou might not look, nor comfort me oppressed,
Nor yet hard heart, my funeral^ pursue among the rest:
The sacred name of frends^ip fair, that al men do adore,
Under thy foot thou le^^^st lie, as thing of little store.
And t^ough thou did ^o tear^s set ^all, ^or this ^y sorty plight,
Yet f^r from heart some words to say, with ^ay^ed grief thou might.
At lea^t wise that to strangers did then bid we well to fare,
With peoples voice and public speech agree that good will bare,
And then thy face with mourning f^et, no more in sight tappere,
W^yle yet thou might to look upon the la^t day I was there.
To take and give with talk alike, o^t farewell in such case,
Which once we might and then ^o more, w^yle world end^res embrace,
As others more which with no league of frend^hip I h^d bo^nde,
W^o then declar^ their grief of mind, with ^rick^yng tears o^ grou^^
W^ere else should I to thee be knit, with (...) in com^on ^ed,
With causes eke of great effect, and ^^at (...) long time bred.
Why else knew thou so many bourdes, and ca^ne^ ac^es of mine,
And I so ma^y matters said, and p^easant prankes of thine.
What if alone at royal Rome our frend^hip had been knit,
But thou so often in every place, was calde a fellow fit.
With wistsome wyndes of seas in vain, have all these taken flight
Or else al things in Lethe lake, are drou^d with darkesome night.
I think in town thou were not borne, that Rome of Q^iri^e hight*
A town alas wherein to come, I may not woeful wight.
But in the rocks which here do lie, on left side of the sea,
In crooked cragges of Sarmatis, in land of Scithia.
That in thy heart be heaped high, of flyne the stony veins
And eke ^ Iron the seeds so hard, within thy breast remaynes.
The nourse also which gave thee suck^ through tender mouth to passe^
With fruitful tears when thou were young, untamed ^iger was.
For else thou would not l^sse regard the heavy hap I bear,
Then strangers ill: nor gylty yet, of rigor rough appear.
But since the same my fatal fall and sorrows do increase,
That frenship should in his first time, from duty doing cease.
Now cause I may forget thy fault, and then I shall again,
With self same tongue thy kindness praise that I do now complain*
To his friend that the common people follovveth fortune. Elegy 8.
ALl void of grief God grant thou may, last end of life attain
Which as a friend to read this work, of mine do not disdain.
And here I wish my prayers might, prevail for thy behoue,
Which for my self the cruel gods, to mercy cold not move.
In number thick thy ^rendes will come, while hap hanges on thy side,
If stormy clouds of time apeare, alone thou shall abide,
Behold how Doves to house resort, in whitely colors cladde,
In b^astly boure of sluttish coat, no byrd abides glad.
The p^ynefull Pismeere never comes, in barn left void and bare,
No friend repayres where goods before, be clean consumde with care.
When Sun does shine the shadow shows, of them that walk abroad,
When it lies hid in cloud he list, no longer make abode,
The unconstant sort of people so, do follow fortunes light,
Which q^e^ched once with houeri^g shower, they straight do take their flight
And would to God thou might perceive, that falsely this do sound,
But I must needs confess them true, by fortune that I found.
While we did stand in perfect state our house desyrde no fame,
But yet was known, and had resort, as did suffice the same.
But when it first began to s^ake, they s^ared sore the fall,
And w^ly backs to flying turned, to save themselves withal.
No maruayle though they fear the flash, of lightning ^ruell flame,
By fire of which all things is wont, consume that near it came.
But Caesar yet among his foes, that friend does well allow,
Which does not shrink but tarry still, when fortune bendes her brow.
^o wonted use ^e has to fume (no man is more modest)
If he which lou'de to lover (...), in troub^lous time is pressed.
The fame does tel^ how Thoas king, on Pylades did rue,
When as by m^te of Grecian Land, Orestes once he knew.
Pat^^^lus perfect faith which was, with great Achilles kni^,
Was wont full often with worthy praise, in Hector^ mouth to sit.
They say because that Theseus, with friend of his did pas.
Among the Princes black of Hell, their God full sor^y was.
We believe O Turnus that thy cheeks with tears were wet.
When thou heard of Eurialu^, and Nysus fayth^^ so set.
In wretches eke there is a love, in foes which we approve,
O heavy hap so few there be which with my words I move,
Such is the state and chance of me, and of my matters all,
That nothing ought my tears to stop* from sorry race to fall.
He reioyseth that his friend profited in learning. Elegy. 9.
ALthough my heart for private chance, with sadness so be fraught,
It ^ighter lies when I hear of, the knowledge thou have caught,
I saw (most dear) that here thou should within this port ariue.
Before this way the wras^ling winds, thy ship began to drive.
If ^anners mild with virtue mixed, or life deuoyde of blame,
Be had in price no man that lives, deserves a better name.
Or if by art of cunning known, that any do ascend,
There comes ^o cause which th^n cannot, with pleasant words defend
With these in mind I moved thus, to thee then straight can say,
A greater stage (O friend) remaynes, thy vert^e to display.
No spleen of Sheep, of Lig^^ning flame, no flashe on left side seen,
No chir^ing song or flight of foul, a s^gne whereof has been.
By reasons rule I did divine, and judge of that should come,
All these in mind I g^ssed right, and of them knowledge ^ome.
In heart therefore I joyful am, for thee they proou^d true,
Also for me, to whom thy wit, was known as did ensue.
But would to God that mine had line, full low in darkness hid,
For need requyres my s^udious style, of lovely ^ight to rid.
And a^ the sci^nce sad and grave, with pyked speech and fine,
Does profit thee: so am I hurt, with lore unlike to thine.
But yet my life thou know right well, how that far from this art,
Is masters manners distant all, ^epugne in every part,
Thou know of old this verse was writ, by me when I was young,
And it was though not to praise, in Jest and playing song.
Like as no crafty couller can, in their defense have might,
So I suppose my verse may not, excused be with right.
Eu^n as thou can, do them excuse, and friends cause not forsake,
And with such steps as thou have gone, thy way right for^h do take.
He prayseth his ship he found at Corinthia. Elegy. 10.
A Ship I have (and God so g^aunt) g^uern'de by Pallas might,
Whose ha^py name no helm th^reof, d^^a^nted is in sight.
I^ sails therein we need to use, with slend^r wind she sails,
Or if the ower: her way she takes, and easy force preuayles.
Her fellows all ^ith speedy course, to p^sse is not content,
But does put back by sundry skilles, all ships that forward bent.
The flowing floude she lightly bears, and sels the t^ssing seas,
No cruel w^ues she yeeldes unto but sails away with ^ase.
With her I came acquaynted first, even a^ Corinthia ground,
Whom since a guide and trusty mate, in fearful slight I found.
Through sundry streights and wicked winds out way she did pr^cure,
Yet was by force of Palla^ power, from danger saved sure.
And now the gates of vas^y Seas, we ^ray that she may (...),
In Geta streams so long time sought, we may at length ar^iue.
Which when she had conuey'de me ^hus, to Hellispontus port,
In narrow trackt away full long, she s^ul^ely did resort.
On left side th^n our course we tourn'de, from Astors famous town,
And to their coasts (o Imbria) th^re, from thence we came a down.
So forth (...) gentle winds when we, Zerinthia did attain,
In Samoth^acia there our ship, all weary ^id remain,
From hence the reach is short, if thou, S^antira seeks to vewe,
So ^arre the happy ship she did, her master still pursue.
Then on Bist^nian fields to go, on f^^te it did me^ please,
My ship forthwith forsaking there, the Hellespontian Seas.
Unto Dardania then which hears, the Au^h^rs (...), we bend,
And thee (o Lampsace) we do seek, w^om rural Gods defend.
W^ere as the Sea does Seston par, from Abydena town,
Even where as Helles whilom fell, in narrow Seas adowne.
From thence to Cizicon which on* Propontis shore do stand,
Cizi^o^ the noble work, of Thessalonians hand.
Whereas Byzantia holds in, the seas on either side,
This is the place of double Seas, that keeps the gate so wide.
And here I ^ray that we may escape, by force of Southren wind,
That from Cyaneas Rocks in have, she straight a way may find,
And so to Enyochus bays, and thence by Polleo fall,
And carried thus to cut her way* by Anchilaus his wall.
Thence unto Messembros port, and to Opeson bowres,
May happily pass (o Bacchus) by, of thee the named towers.
Now to Alchathoes we go, which of the waves be spronge,
Who fl^inge ^orth (men say) did build, herein their houses strong.
From which unto Myletus town, it faulfely may arrive,
Whereto the fearce and heavy wrath, of angry Gods do drive.
Which if we may attain unto, a lamb there shall be sl^yne,
Mynerua to: for greater gift, our goods do not sustain.
And you dame Hellens bre^hr^n twain, to whom this I Will do bend,
Your double power to both our ships, we pray that you do lend.
The one unto Symplegades, prepares her way to make,
The other through Bys^on^a, her journey thence do take.
Cause you that since we diverse plats, of purpose go unto,
Tha^ she may have, and so may this, their wished winds also.
How that he made his first book in his Journey. Elegy. 11.
Within this book what letter be, that thou perhaps shall reed,
In troublous time, of careful way, ye same was made in deed.
For either Adria saw we there, in cold Decembers day,
How weepinge verse amids the Seas, to write I did assay.
Or else with double Seas in course, I Istmos ouerc^me,
And other ships thereby in flight, our fellows so became.
When Cy^lades amassed were and marvel much did ta ke
How I among the roaring ^^ouds, these verses yet cold make:
And now my self do wonder sore, that in such ^aging waves,
Of mind and Seas my very wits, thems^lues from danger s^ues.
For be ^t maze with care hereof, or madness we it call,
This study does repel from mind my thoughts and sorrows all.
Often times in doubtful mind ^o tossed, by stormy kinds I was,
Often times with Sterops star ye Sea, through threatening waves I pas
Arthophilax, that keeps the bear, does da^kd the day at ^awne,
And south wind with the waters fearce, the Hiada^ has drawn.
Often times some part thereof did pas into my s^ip aryght,
Yet trembling I this woeful verse, with fearesul hand do wryghte.
Now with the Northren wyndes the ropes con^ented are to crake.
And like to hills the Hollow Seas a lofty surging make.
The master with his hands cast up, does pray with fearful heart,
Beholding then the heavenly stars forgetful of his art,
On every side we only saw of Death the picture plain,
Which I in mind did fear and yet so fearing wish again.
God grant I may to port ariue, I fear the same right sore,
In water far less danger is, then ^n that cursed shore.
Of sub^il snares of m^n and floods, we stand in drea^y dreede,
The sword and Sea my wretched mind with double ter^our f^ede.
The one does hope with guiltles blond a pray of me to make,
The other of my woe^u^l death, the fame ^ould gladly take.
On left side dw^lth a people rude, whose minds be bent to spoil,
In blameless blood, and slaughter fearce, and ^ruel wars they bo^le,
And while the washing wa^^r^ are, with wi^^er (...) wrought,
Our mind^s to greater ^o^le (then Seas) by heavy ^ap be brought.
Wherefore thou ought more pa^don here (O gentle Reader) have.
If these appear, as sure it is much less then (...) do crave.
My Gardens now we want wherein, I wonted was to wright,
The used beds my body lackes to rest the w^^ry night.
Wit^ bitter winter days I am, in wicked w^t^rs thrown,
My papers pa^e, with surges soust, the griesly S^as hau^ known,
The winter angry is that I, these verses dare indight,
And dreadful threatenings casts there my purpos^ so to spite.
Of man let winter victor be, in self ^ame case I pray,
That I may cease my simple verse, and he his raging stay.
FINIS.
Here begins the second BOOK.
To Augustus Caesar. Elegy 1
WIth you what thing have I ado, my books my hoplesse care^
Since that my ^its (o wretch) because yt I of life despair.
My verse condemned muses why? ^epete I now again?
And it is not enough, that I have once thus s^ffred ^ayne?
My verses ^o a mean have been, by heavy hap so grown
That I (alas) on every side, to man and wife am known.
By verses the does Caesar note, me and my manners all,
Through peruers art which now of late in deep disdain is fall*
My paynful studyes set aside, no faul^es of life remain,
That guylty I imputed am, my verse has caused plain.
This we receive, as price of life, and labors great of mind,
And now my paynful pynching pains, in woeful wit I fy^de.
If wise I were, I should of right, the learned sisters blame,
As grievous goddesses to such as worship will the same.
But madness now with fever fearce, are joined so in one,
That mindful yet of former pain, my foot does strike the stone.
Like as the wounded soldier does, resort the f^eld unto,
Or as the wracked ship does seek, on swel yng seas to g^e.
Perhaps li^e him, which once within, Teutrantus real^e did rain,
The same which made this grievous wound, thereof may ease the pain,
And angry muse which moved ire, the same likewise remove,
For weping verse do grace obtain, at mighty Gods above,
The worthy dames of Italy, does Caesar will to pr^y,
To Ops which stately towers bear, and founding verse to say.
The like to Phoebus eke what ^yme, ^ere played the plea^ant plays,
Which never oftener cold be seen, but once in one men's days.
Lo these (O gracious Caesar now) as h^ppy myrrours have,
And let my wits more m^lder wrath, of thee hereafter crave.
The same is just I do confess, nor my deserts deny,
Nor shame so far departed is from fearful face to fly.
But if I had offended naught what could you then bestow?
My let therefore occasion is whereof that mercy grow.
So oftentimes as mortal men, in sinful faulte^ be ^ound.
If love should strike he might in time lack shot whe^with to wound.
But he when once with th^ndring noise, have thr^atned sore the land,
With sprinkled drops the cloudy air, is cleared out of hand.
A God, a guide, a father grave, of right he called have been,
As mighty Jove nothing so great, in Uasty world is seen.
Since thee also a father grave, and guide in earth thy name,
Use then of Gods the maner^ myld, thy power it is the same,
The which full well thou do, nor no man with more equal hand,
The rightful reanes could better hold, wherewith to rule the land.
The P^rchian^ proud thou did subdue, yet pardon often bestow,
Which they to thee in case alike, would not have given I know.
Wi^h worldly wealth and honors high, advanced many be,
Whose guilty hands did weapons wear, in field adverse to thee.
The day also with moved ^re, thy wrath away did take,
S^ either part in sacred house, at once their offringes make.
And as the soldier does rejoice, who did thy foes oppress,
So have the captives cause enough, to joy at such distress.
My cause yet better is: I wear no weapon so untrue.
Nor enemies guilty goods I do, with greedy lust ^urs^e.
By seas, by land, by starry sky, lo here I make my vow.
By thee also that present is, a God to whom I bow.
That this good will (o most of might) have ever been in me,
And as thine own with heart and soul, I sought always to be.
I wished often that here thou might, in earth have lived long.
And one I was that prayed thus amids the mighty thronge.
And sacrifyce for this I gave, and with mine own assent,
When public prayers were pronounced, to help to this intent,
My books my faulty factes also, what n^ede I have in mind,
Wherein thy name a thousand times, in open place I find.
Behold likewise my greater wor^es, vnended as they be,
W^ere that transformed bodies are in wondrous wise to se.
There shall thou find by flitteryng ^ame, thy name have had much praise,
There shall thou f^nde by pledges great of loving mind always.
Thy glory yet no verse can well, augment in any wise,
Since nothing may thereto be put, whereby it might arise.
Of Jove the fa^e does far exc^ede, yet does it him delight,
When as the same in sta^^ly verse, we seemly do endight.
If that by Gyauntes bloody wars of mention ought be hard,
At pr^^se thereof he does rejoice, for truth we do regard.
But th^e do others honor more and as it seems f^t.
Thy princely praise and royal fame* do praise with riper wit.
And as with shedding guil^lesse blood, of bulls a hundredth slain*
Of God with smallest ensenc^ given, so grace we do obtain.
O wicked wight, O tyrant fearce, O cruel cursed foe,
That did my pleasant fancies make to the disclos^d so.
To verses which in books discryb^, to thee thine honor due,
From reader ought in judgment just, more favor to ensue,
But if thou hap offended be* who then dare be my friend?
No scant unto my self I should, my faithful friendship lend.
When as ^ house decayed is, and se^led on the side,
Then all the mas^y wa^ght thereof, to yelding pa^tes do slide.
Or elswhereas by fortunes force, a ^hincke therein is wayde.
With praise thereof in tract of ^ime, the same is soon decade.
The great envy of men so we, by hurtful verse do find,
And people be (as me it is) to Caesar's side enclynde.
When as my life and manners yet, were more alowde I know,
And by the horse the same I judge, which then thou did bestow*
The which although it profits naught, nor honest praise I have,
Yet from the name of cruel crime, my self I wish ^o save.
No cause to me committed was, of guilty men amiss
For judges t^n times ten to look, upon whose office is,
And private playntes without offense, as judge I did decree
With v^ryght mind the same I gave, it will confessed be
And that (O wretch) if latest deeds had not offended more,
Even by thine own ass^nt, I should not once be sau'te before.
The latest acts do me destroy, my ship which safely sailde,
In depthy and swallowing waves, through sturdy storm is faylde.
No little part of wh^lming waves, oppresses me alone,
But all the flock of flowing floods, and Ocean seas in one.
Why saw I ought? mine eyes why have, I guilty causd to be?
W^y is m^ fault vn^eeting I, now ^nowi^g se well to me?
The ^^eck't Diana Acteon saw, unawares as he did pas,
To hunge^ bounds a present pray, no whit the less he was
For mighty gods do punish those, by chance that do offend,
Nor pa^^on oug^t wh^re po^ers be hurt, to such mishaps do lend,
So in that day wherein I was with error thus beguyld,
Our little ^ous^ decayed i^, with fault yet vndefyld.
And little though^ yet of good fame, even in my fathers days,
Nor unto none in^^riour now, for honors noble praise,
Not ^or the w^^lth nor want thereof, it can so well be known,
For neither (...) beca^se wh^rof, our knighely name is grown.
And be (...) by our birth or rent our house be little namde,
My wits and payn^ul studi^^ causde abroad it has been faynde.
Which though percase I seem to use, as young and wantonly,
Yet by that mean through world so wide, my famous name do ^lye.
O^ Naso eke the name is known* amidst the learned thronge,
W^o ^are of him the same record^, no abject men among.
This house therefore to muses great, in great decay is fall,
By one offense and careful crime, yet not accounted final.
But so decayed as rise it may, if that the raging ire,
Of grieved Caesar waxes ripe, to wonted use retire.
Whose gracious mercy is so great, in judgment of our pain,
That not so much ^s we did fear, we have received plain
Our life is given and not my death, his gentle wrath does crave,
With used power (O noble Prince) we pray therefore to save.
I have ^lso with thine assent, my fathers livings all,
As though my life thou did account, ^ gift that were to small.
My doleful deeds have not condemd, by Senates close assent,
Nor by decree of them oppressed, in wretched exile sent.
With threatening words rebuking vice (as best a Prince beseem)
Offenses all thou do revenge and mercy so esteem.
And those decrees which were pronounc'de in stern and a^per wise*
Yet in the name of lighter fault thou wild it should suffice.
Thus as dischargd and sent away, no exiles name I have,
My happy days d^priuing so, and life thereby to save.
No pain or grief so grievous is, no trouble such of mind.
As to displease so great a Prince his vengeance there to f^nde.
But Gods which whilom moved were, sometimes appeased be,
And scowling clouds once driu^n assyde, a day full fair we see.
The Elm which lately blasted was, deprived of his green,
The clustred vines eftsoon to bear, full oftentimes is seen.
And though thou do forbid to hope, we hope assuredly.
This one thing yet may come to pass, though thou thereto deny
My hope increase (O gentle Prince) when thee I do behold,
And eke decrease when I respect my faults so manyfold.
The roaring rage of swellyng seas, is not alyke always,
^or furies fierce does ever last* in tossing streams to stay.
But sometimes be more calm and clear, and cease their used toil,
To make us think the force were lost, of byllowes boisterous broile
So do my fears both* rise and fall, sometime in doubt remain,
In hope and dread of thy good will, to pass or prove my pain.
For love of Gods therefore which give, the^ long and happy days,
(If they of noble Romans do esteem thy name and praise)
For country eke which thou do keep, as guide and father dear,
Whereof my self a part I was, and thence now passed clear.
To thee the stately town so shall, with honors due resound,
W^o do for wit and famous factes, in wondrous wife ^bound.
So Liuia with thee remain, and live in wedded life,
Which were but even for thee alone a far unworthy wife.
If she were not, a s^^gle life, should best beseem for thee,
For none there lives to whom thou might ^ wedded husband be.
Of thee so shall ^ son in health, and thou in health to rain,
Which may in thy more elder ^ge, an old man here remain.
And bring to pass that happy stars, through those thy noble deeds*
With neuewes young shall still abide, that thee in realm succedes.
So victory which used is, thy noble castles to,
Shall still be pressed at hand always, to customd ensigns go.
S^e shall with wonted wings still fly, with guide of Laui^ land,
On happy head a Laurel green, shall set with semely hand
By whom thou famous war^ do keep, in parson also fight,
To whom good luck by thee is given, with Gods of maru'lous might.
And thus i^ mighty town art s^ene, as present half to bide,
And half away in further parts, the bloody wars to guide.
A victor great from foes subdu'de, he shall return to thee,
With crowned horse and tryumphes brave, advanced shall he be,
B^t spare we pray thy lightning fearce and cruel shot up lay,
W^erof (O wretch) we have alas, to long now made assay,
Thou art our country father dear, not mindles of this name,
We pray thee spare and grant us hope, in time to have no blame.
To come again I do not crave, yet well believe we may,
That mighty Gods more harder suites, have not denied always.
A gentler kind of exiles life, and nerer place bestow,
Then of my pains the greatest part would be allayd I know*
The furthest land I do approve, and cast among my f^es,
Nor no man from his country that, so far an exile goes.
In Haven of seuenfold I stars Sea, alone here am I sent,
With frosty axe of Archadie, in cruel care am pent.
The Iazegies, the Colcho^ eke, and all the Getan rout.
With Me^e^ius whom Danube stream may skant from h^nce keep out.
And though that diverse be driven forth, for much more great offense,
Yet none to place more f^r then I, is sent away from thence.
B^yond this land no thing there is, save cold and enmies fell,
With waters thin of whelming sea. with frosty yse congell.
On left side here Euxinians join, to part of Roman land,
And next the Basterns and the Savvromes keep wit^ cruel hand.
This is the land that latest came to rule of Romayne law,
And scantly any part thereof, thine ^mpire near do draw.
Whe^fore I humbly pray that we, be set in saul^er soil,
L^ast else with loss of counrey dear, we live in endless toil.
So need we not the nations f^^re, whom I star skant deuyde,
Nor as thy subjects there be t^ne, with cruel foes to bide.
For no ^an borne of Latian blood can bear those barberous bands,
But that the^ will a burden be unto Caesarians hands
Two faults there are that have me slain, error and my verse.
All other ^aultes I think it good that I do not rehearse.
Thy grievous wounds (O Caesar) now renew I do not mean,
And that thou hau^ bewayld t^em onc^, to much I do esteem.
Another part of crime remaynes, a grievous fault for me,
A ^eacher of aduoutry foul, I charged am to be,
Some things the Gods may well deceive, then for to know is hard,
Of them for many be so mean, that thou do not regard.
For while as Jove beholdes the heavens, and mighty Gods also,
The smaller thing from lofty skies, cannot respect unto.
So many matters they escap^, in vewing world so wide,
That l^sse affa^res of mean^r wayght, from ^eauenly ^inde do slide.
That is while thou a Prince be set, in Empire large ^o rain,*
May not entend fond verse to read, and greatter things disdain.
The wa^ghty w^^ght of Romayne name, do not so ^ighty move,
No^ pray^e thereof on back to bear, so (...) thee ^ehoue.
As thou with Godly power may ma^ke, our fond and foolish toys,
Wi^h open eyes here to discuss, our idle earthly joys.
Some^ymes Germania does rebel, sometimes Illerians ^^yle,
Rh^tia and the Th^a^ian land, with ci^ill wa^^es (...).
S^met^^^ Armenius craves peace and Parthus (...) ^elde.
With f^^r^ful bands resto^yng ^ft the e^s^g^es won ^n ^^elde,
Ge^mania eke through infant young, a yo^g man t^ee do take,
And Caesar does f^ll cruel w^^res, for mig^^^ Caesar make.
In fine, of all th^ne empire huge (which never was (...) large)
No pa^^ (...) all abated is, but still ^en aynes in charge.
The City great and sure def^nc^, of cus^o^es and of law,
Does ^ike the sore? wh^le the^ ^ho^ s^ekes, (...) more ^ere to draw
The q^^et state ^hou can not use, which thou have ^ald in land,
For ^ro^blous wars with nations great, thou daily takes i^ hand.
Wherefore among such causes grave, I maruayle much and muse,
That thou our w^nted follies would, with earnest eyes peruse.
But if thou had (as I do wish) ^^re idle there have been,
Then in mine art no ^ault at all, perhaps thou should have seen.
The which I do confess was not, deu^sde with seue^e head,
Nor matter meet that might deserve of such a prince be read.
Yet be they not to laws offense, nor gylty of such blames,
But to enstruct the youthful route, of noble Romayne dames.
N^r need not my books to doubt, for in one of those three,
These verses ^ower which next approach, ^e set therein to see.
Stand you aloof you vestal tape^, of s^amefastne^ the signs,
Give place likewise ye purfled Pavvles, that half on feet declynes
Of lavvf^ll lot and skill allovvd, we only do resoonde,
For in our simple verse there shall, no subt^^l crime be found.
Lo ^o we not all sober dames, from this our art expell^
Whom stole and tape forbids plain with lovely love to mell?
B^t matrones may more arts ^^uent, although they be untaught*
W^erby to make the chastest minds, with wickedness be fraug^t.
No books therefore let matrons read, s^th all things be so strange,
That they be turnde from virtuous use, to f^lthy vice to change.
W^o lo does care all things to turn to wrong and wor^er part,
To vices vile his manners change, through will of workers heart.
For take in hand the C^ronicke books, then those nothing more grave
How Ilia fair a babe brought forth, to read there shall thou have.
Or if thou ^oke on Maroes works, there shall thou see in s^ght,
How Venus fair a mother was unto the Troyan Knight.
Yea further yet if ^ll things may, likewise accounted be.
No kind of verse but may the mind, corrupt also we see.
As guilty yet not every book, we may therefore disp^se*
For of each thing that help proceeds, does harm als^ arise.
Then ^re what thing more needful to? yet who so lokes in land,
The howses high to burn and spoil, the fire he t^kes in hand.
So P^^s^ck sometimes greatly hur^es, sometimes do^^ heal right well,
Of herbs that hurtful be or not, by skil^ul ^ore to tell
The thief and ware wa^fayr^ng man, by side a sword they have.
The one to ro^ the s^mple wight, the other himself to save.
And R^thorick have long time ben taug^t, to plead for righteousness,
Yet faulty fol^es it often def^ndes, and innocents ^ppresse
Even so w^o shall my v^^ses read, with eq^all upright mind,
Shall well persuade himself enoug^, (...) hurt in them to find.
And who so thinks he sin conceyues, or vices here of have,
But erreth much, and writings mine, to much he does deprave.
In sacred plays (I do confess) ^e certain wanton (...),
The stages thereof do remove, whereon the players sli^.
What causes also have been given, of sin and great mischaunce
In marshall fields and places great where fighters do advance?
Let Ci^cus (...) b^ set aside, the use thereof not good,
The maidens chaste thereon at plays, by men unknown they stood.
While men do rome in selfsame path, where lovers do resort,
Why then be porches set at large where all men may disport.
What place then temples is more l^rge? yet is their cause of ^inne,
I^ wicked minds that so delytes, by hap be set therein.
For set in sacred house of Jove perchance it may be seen,
What number great of mothers made, by mighty Jove have been.
Or who shall in the Temples pray, of Lady Juno true
The Gods she there bewayling sees, and wanton Lemman^ vewe.
So some will ask that Pallas see, as they her picture pas,
How of her Eriththonius, by sin conceived was.
And coming to the house shall see of Mar^ the heavenly wight,
Before the gates where Venus stands, fast by her worthy knight.
In Isis Church who chance, to sit w^^l happily a^^e in doubt,
By Ionian and the Bosphore seas, why Juno sent her out.
For Venus there Anchises is, for Luna Latinus old,
For Ceres ^ke does Iatius stand, on whom thou may behold.
All these things therefore may corrupt, the wicked perverse mind,
Yet in their place full harmles stand, not wrested from there kind.
Far from this art which w^itten was, for wanton dames behoue,
The foremost leaf of that same book, all modest hands remove.
Who so therefore by hap offend, more th^n the livers chaste:
With guilty men of fault forbode, shall he straight ways be pla^^?
No heinous act the wanton verse, it is to lightly reed,
For many things the chaste may see which be abhord in deed.
The matrons grave do often behold, the baudy harlots love,
How naked there themselves they make, dame Venus pr^nkes to prove.
The Uestall eyes likewise they do, the S^rompets body see,
Yet to themselves by sight thereof, no pains deserved be
But why have I so much (alas) my muse to wanton made?
Or what have causd my wicked book to lovely lore persuade?
No thing save sin and open fault, of force I must confess,
My wits and skill I do accuse, as cause of my distress.
Why have I not the Troyan town, by Gretians whilom sacked,
In Asper verse the same renu'de, and toulde that famous fact?
Why spoke I not of Thebas slege, and wounded brethren twain*
And how the seven gates thereof, in sundry charge remain?
And marshall Rome occasion gave, whereof I should endight,
A godly work it were for me, my country facts to wright.
In fine: while that by thy deserts, all things so much abound^,
A cause I had (O Caesar) why thy praise I should resounde.
Even as the eyes delighted be, with beams of Phoebus bright,
So did thy facts my mind entise, to take thereof delight.
As rightfully I am reprou'de, in barren field I t^l'de,
That noble work is far more large, with greater plentye fil'de,
For though the slender boat is bold, in smaller stream to play,
Yet like disport it dares not in surginge seas assay.
And doubting that for greater things, my mind is far unfit,
In ditties small it may suffice, that I do show my wit.
But if thou should command to tell, of G^aunts grievous wound^s,
Which they through fire of Jove did feel: the work my wit confou^des*
A fruictfull mind it does require, of Caesar's acts to wright,
Least else perhaps with matter much, the work may want his right.
Which though I durst have take in hand, yet dreading much among,
Thy noble power I might abate, which were to great a wrong.
To lighter work I therefore went, and youthful verse addressed,
With ^ayned love a care I had* to feed my fi^le bre^st.
Which loath I was full long to do, but fates did so ordain,
And deep des^re my mind did move, to purchase grievous pain.
Why have I learn'de? O wretch why have, my parents taught me lore*
On letters small why have I set, my woeful eyes before?
For this I am of thee enuide, by wanton art aright,
Through which thou thincks ye chasty heads, be traind to foul delight.
But none whom wedlocks yoke does bind, this craft have learnd of me,
For who so nothing knows himself, no teacher can he be,
So have I made both pleasant Toys, and gentle facile verse,
As yet ^n talk for by word leude, no wight may ^e rehearse.
Nor none who lives in wedded life, among the common rought,
That of himself a father false, through my default do dought.
My manners mild repugnant are, to verse (believe you me)
My life both chaste and shamefa^t is, though muse mor e pleasant be.
And greatest part of those my works, inventions are untrue,
For much more craft they do allow, then maker ever knew.
Nor written books do not purport, th'aff^ctions of the mind,
But honest will to pleasant mirth, to make the ca^es inclynde.
For Aceius t^en in cruel deeds, Terentius should delight,
In b^nk^t^ brave: and warriors be, of wars that do endight.
In fine: though diverse are with me, that tender l^ue have m^yde,
Yet I al^n^ for it (O wretch) the pains alone have paid.
Theia mus^ of Le^yan old, has she not taught the skill?
With plenty great of Bacchus dew, dame Venus neast to fill?
that ha^h dame Sappho Lesbia learn'de, but maidens fair to love,
Yet Sa^pho still remains ^aul^e, and he no pa^nes do prove.
What has it thee ( o Battis) hurt that reading of thy verse,
T^y pleasant pr^ncks thou did confess, and wanton joys rehearse.
No fab^e ^ounde but tells of love, in great Menanders book,
Yet is it red to Uirgins yongue, and Boys thereon do look.
What shall you read in Ilias, but foul aduouterous life?
And fear aff^^ct of lovers false, with toil and endless strife,
Therein what is there set before, of Chresida the love?
And of the maid from Captains caught, which anger great did move.
What is Odys^ea else? but while Vl^s^e^ was away*
How of his wise the love to get, what Wo^rs did ^ssay.
What does great Homer more report, but Mars to Venus bound,
And that they were in filthy bed, and foul aduou^ry ^ound.
By him have we not knowledge caught, ^ha^ mo^^de with loves (...)?
One stranger caus'de two G^ddesses, to bu^ne in secret fire?
Though Tragedies all writings do surmount, for matter gr^ue,
Yet even in them occasions great, of love always we have.
For in Hyppolitus the love* of Phaedra do we find,
And eke how constant Canace lou'de, her bro^^er not unkind.
What did not then king Pelop^ white, when Cupid forcte his chair,
With Phrygian horses fearce convey, Hippodamia fair?
Provoked grie^e through loves desire, in sc^^^ so much it was,
That mothers caus'de their cruel Bledes, through childrens blood to pas,
And love a king with Lemman ^ayre, in (...) foul^s did change,
And made Sir Itis mother mourn, with s^ghes, and sobbing strange.
If that Europaes brother vile, her love did not require,
With Phoebus: then we h^d not read, how horses did retire.
Nor Scylla should have so attayn'de, the Tr^g^cke style unto,
Unless that love her Father forste, his fatal hearse forgo.
Whose life by hap Electran reads and made Orestes fit,
Aegestus faults nor Clytemnestras, sins, he can forgit.
What need I speak of Victor that Chymera did oppress?
Who crafty gest did much annoy, to death almost distress.
Who has not spoke of Hermyone, and thee Chentyda told,
Of Alcumene whom Mycene Duke, in louinge breast did fould.
What Daneyes daughter in law, her self? what Bacchus Dame?
What Hermyona with her which caus'de, of one two Nights became*
Of Duke Admere, of Theseus eke, what should I here resounde,
Of Greek whose ship did first arrive, on coast of Pgrygian ground.
Let Ioels come among the rest, with Deidamia fair,
With Hylas to and Ganimede, who did to heaven repair.
No time would serve the Traiecke syres, if I for them should look,
Whose names alone could not be set, within this careful book.
And Tragedies the laughters foul, provoke in sundry wise*
Yea shameless words full many a one, because of them arise.
What has it hindered him that did, the fearce Achill abuse?
For which his valiant deeds were lost, and force did him refuse.
Aristides the filthy facts, of fond My^^^^^ns told,
Yet from his town was not exild, nor in such wise contrould.
Nor Eubius a writer great, of hystoryes unclean,
How mothers might their seed^ consume, by foul and filthy mean^.
Nor he who wrote the books, which men, Sabatia have nam'de,
Nor they whose own aduouterous deeds, to tell were not asham'de.
All these with grave and ancient sawes, of learned men be vs'de,
The facts apparaunt be yet not, to princes so refus'de.
Nor I these forrayne factes alone for my defense do find,
But even in Romayne books I read, the toys of wanton wind.
As Ennius grave who wonted was, of mighty Mars to tell,
Ennius though void of art, in wit he did excel.
Lucretius eke the cause discust, of fearce consuminge flame,
And triple work he did divine, of which proceed the same.
So did Catullus wanton man, his Lemmans praise resight,
Whose name in deed he changed have, and Lesbia therefore hight.
Nor yet contented so but did, of Harlots mo rehearse,
With whom aduoutry vile he did, confess in open verse.
Like lawles life did Caluus lead, whose stature was but small,
By sundry means disclosing then, his filthy doings all.
What should I speak of Tynda^es style, and Memnus verse also,
Who writing of dishonest acts, their names have put unto.
And Cinna here a fellow is, and Anser light as he,
And Cornificius wanton, work, and Catoes eke we see.
And he who in Phasecian seas, that Argos whilom brought,
His secret deeds could not keep in, which he before had wrought.
Ho^^ensi^^ and Sulpitius facts, lascivious be likewise,
And such grave men who follows not, or does their deeds despise.
Sisenna did Mylesian books, reduce to Romayne verse,
No pains he proved yet, though filthy facts he did rehearse.
Nor Gallu^ th^ugh Lycoris feast he did often times adore,
Was blamed ought: but deemed druncke, with wine he bibd before.
To women's oaths small trust to have, Tibullus whilom wou^d,
Nor of them selves what they denied, no husband credit should.
For keepers eke of virgins chaste, a fraud he did confess,
And now (O wretch) through self fame art, is driven to deep distress.
And as he would of signet fair, or Jewels virtue find,
By craft whereof his mystresse hand, to touch he bears in mind.
By privy poynctes and crafty b^cks, to show their secret mind,
He also taught: and subtle notes, in trenchers fair to find.
And by the sap of certain herbs, how wrath is set a side,
Whereas the same through mutual mouths by stre^ts of teeth do glide,
And eke how they should plenty great, of foolish husbands crave,
Whereby the less they might offend, and less occasion have.
At whom also the dogs, do barcke, when men that way are gone,
And secret hemmes he taught to know, when he did pass alone.
Full many a crafty lore he learn'de, which women did receive,
Even by, what art the wedded wives, their husbands might deceive.
For these yet no rebuke he had, his works apparent be,
And well alow'de, to thee our Prince, are not unknown we see.
Propertius like precepts have ge^uen, which be apparent plain*
No check or frowninge look he did, for that although sustain.
And many more I did succeed, who (since they live in ^ame)
I will not now in open verse, recite them by their name.
I feared not (I do confes^e) among so great a sail,
My only ship to perish quite, and none but she to fail.
And other arts with trouling dice, lo diverse written have.
Through which no small offense is cast, upon your grands^rs grave.
How that thou may by subtle mean, the greatest number throw,
And dogged poinctes may best eschew, through crafty art to know.
In Tables play what marks avail, or hurtful are likewise,
A skill they have to use the good, and lo^s^nge poyncts dispyse.
And how the knight in, coullers clad, does rage in right sorts way,
When middle man through ennemies twain, assault is made a pray.
And how they best may march abroad, or form^n make retire,
For none alone from wa^de to pass, f^r fea^e of hurtful hyre.
A game also with little stone, so p^ast^ on table small,
W^ere at he winn'th that mak'th all three, in one straight line to fall.
And other Plays deui^ed be (nor all to ^ell I mean)
Through which our time a ^hinge most dear, is so consumed clean.
And other tell'th the ^orme of Balls, and skill of Tennis plays,
And some the Swimming art ^oth show, and some the top as^ayes.
The c^aft with coullers black to slain, do diverse take in hand
Of banquet bowers and household laws, have others deeply skand.
Of earth do others teach the use, whereof the cup^es do make,
And which the wyn^ preserues and which, will other liquor take.
Such kind of sportes in smoky mouth, of cold^ D^c^mbers day,
A^e v^ed yet: nor maker none, for them the pains do pay.
Through these exam^^^s lo I have no weeping verses maid,
But weeping pains for pleasant sportes, I have alas assayd.
In fine: among these writers all, I can perceive not one,
To whom his Muse have hurtful been, my self except alone.
What if I should the filthy plays, of ^ayling Iesters wryght,
Wherein the faults of feigned love, be set alwa^es in sight,
And where the vicious man comes ^orth, in garments fresh and brave.
And wily wife her foolish mate, by sleight deceived have,
Lo these: both maid, wife, and man, with s^ely children see,
And oftentimes the senate whole, in parson present be,
The which alone with shame^es spe^che, do not defile the ear,
But filthy facts before the eyes they have disclosed there.
And when the lover by his craft the husband does begyle,
They clap their hands with wondrous joy, and great rejoicing smyle.
And that although less needful is: for Poets greedy g^yne,
The Petor will of forged plays, with charge the sight attain.
B^^olde of Plays the great ^xpence (O Caesar) and the charge,
Which thou have paid, thou s^alt perceive, y^ same have been ^ight large.
Lo these thy self full o^t have seen, and showed to others plain,
Thy majesty so lowly is, thy grace nothing ^^sdayne.
The ^oyall eyes wherewith thou do, the total world behold,
Th'adultry vile have gladly seen, which that in Scene is ^ol^e,
W^^refore if lawful that it be, that Ies^ers so may wright
My ^eedes less pains deserve, they do more honest ac^es resight.
But is that kind of writing sa^e, for P^lpets (...) regard?
And what the s^age have lawful made, from I^st^^s no^ r^gard?
So have the people daunced often, when song my po^ses been,
With open eyes the some also, thy self o^t times have seen.
Even as the ancient pictures made, by craft of workemans hand,
With glistering gloss be set in s^ght, within your house to stand.
I^ them so be their ^^bles small, in private place I know,
W^^ch sundry shapes and secret deeds, of Lady Venus show.
And as the (...) Ajax sits, with th^eatning brows all bent,
Or as the Bar^rous mothers eye, to wicked act is l^nt,
Even so the watery Ven^s sits, her dampish hayres to dry,
And s^metimes seems in mother s^as, away from s^ght to fly.
And others be which cruel wars, with weapons sharp do tell,
Yea so^e t^y graundst^rs deeds and some thine own do show right well.
In narrow space the hateful wight, dame Nature has me pent,
No^ to my wo^ull wayling w^ts, but slender force have lent.
O happy yet for him it was Aeneados did wright,
W^o M^rian head^ wi^h mighty men, and weapon ^^erce resight.
No part of all which famous work, the readers do delight,
So much: as that, where love was ^inckt again all honest right.
Of Phyllis he likewise have told, and Amarylli^ love,
I^ youthful years he sought his mind, with Bucolickes to move.
And we who have by wr^ting these, committed greeu^us sin,
O^r sinful factes much elder be, though pains but now begin.
I verses also made when thou offenses have contrould,
A knight by thee to pass often times, I void of check was bold.
W^erefore I young and wanting wit in that no danger thought,
Which now to me in elder age, more hurt^ull care have brought.
A new revenging pa^nes I feel for ancient written Art,
The persecution differs far from time of my defart.
Yet of my works ^ou may believe, more wayghty burdens bear,
For oftentimes more massy sails, my ship sustained there.
For books twyse ^ix I written have, and Fasto^ did them name,
In number like of ^onthes were made, and ended in the sa^e.
And that, that through my heavy fate, I did (O Caesar) make,
W^erein I highly honored th^e, when I my way did take.
Y^^ T^agike still in royal verse we also did endight,
W^erein no waight^ words do want, that stately style should light.
I^ verse lik^w^se ^e ^ould, altho^gh the works imperfect been,
W^ere sundr^ shapes ^rans^ormed are, and changed bodies seen.
B^t would to God thy wrath a w^ile, from mi^de thou would remove,
And that of th^^e same part to read, thou would m^ behoue.
The work which at the worlds vpryse his first b^ginning had,
To thy ^ost famous ^aygne I brought, and wro^^ (O Caesar^ glad.
There shall thou find what store o^ wit, on me (...),
And with what mind ^or thee and thine, to write I have assa^ed,
I do no man with ^yting verse, or churlis^e c^ecke disda^ne,
Nor no man's guilty ^actes there does, within my works ^emayne*
From s^b^ill ^oyes I guilt^es am, that ten pre^ be (...) ga^l,
Nor (...) my verse no venyme fell* with mirth is mixed at all.
Among so many thousand men, with verses ^any a one,
My learned muse have hindered no^e (^y s^l^e except alone)
At my mishap I guess therefore, no Romayne does rejoice*
But much bewail our sundry woes, with one l^^enting voice*
Nor no man would I think be sad, in this ^y ^or^y chance,
If mercy me through gui^^les life to g^eater ca^e advance.
Lo th^se with many more I wish, may perce thy heavenly breast,
(O father dear) O sure de^ence, our coun^ryes only ^est.
To Italy I would not turn, unless in longer space,
Through greater pains of thee perhaps, we ^ay deserve more grace*
More safer place for Exiles life, and gentler rest I crave,
So shall my faults and careful crimes, their due deseruinges have.
FINIS.
The third Book*
The book to the Reader. Elegia. 1.
IN Fearful wise an Exiles book am sent ^he town to see,
Thy helping hand, to weary ^r^nd (^ Reade^) ^end tho^ me.
Nor doubt thou not least I be cause, perhaps to work (...) s^a^e,
No vers^ in t^is dot^ (...) to love, whe^eb^ to ^orce ^he sa^e.
^or masters fortune has ^en such, alas vn^a^^^ wight,
That (...) Ies^es or (...)
And that which ^e in (...)
To late (^ woeful w^^ke) does n^w, ^ith (...) d^fy.
B^h^ld therefore what I do bring, (...) ^hought at al,
Such (...) ^eete in (...) as do^^ to (...)
Ec^e other (...),
The wea^y ^oote or ^eng^^ of way, the cause (...) of ^aue deen^.
I am not staynd in C^dars say nor wrought with P^^nice bright,
For shame it were to be m^re brave then master may with right.
The letters sad whereof the blots, bereft of wonted grace,
The sorry tears that work has hurt, which fe^l from Poets face:
If any word he wrested have, from light of latin sense,
The b^rbrous land have for^t thereto, and cause proceeded thence,
Then tell, if pain be none which way, (O R^ader) is most sure,
And by what steps a strangers book, my passage may procure.
While these I spoke with stamering tongue, and closely all a^one,
My journey, so: that ^olde there was, among them a^l but one.
God grant thou may, which N^so to has been denied plain,
That in thy country here may bide, and (...) rest obtain.
Guyd one I shall pursue, although by seas and land I sought,
All ty^ed long my weary feet, from furth^st country brought.
O^rying then and passing forth (quoth he) this is the g^te,
Of Caesar's Court: and wa^ the name, from Gods have grown but late
This is the vestale place that keeps dame Pallas and the fire,
This is the Palace small, whereto King Numa did aspyre.
From hence on left side look (quoth he) Satu^nus house do stand.
Here Romulus the lofty Rome to build did take in hand.
And wondering much: forthwith in sight I glitering armor spyde,
And royal gates with heavenly bowers, in perfect view descryde.
Behold of Jove the house (quoth he) which we may so divine,
By royal Crown of Oken tree, that high thereon do shine.
His name once hard forthwith I said, we have divided well,
O^ mighty Jove it i^ the house, and he therein do dwell.
But ^o, what cause the noble gates, be hid with Laurel green?
Or why the tree with branches spread, has made his beire unseen?
For that this house of tryumphes brane, deserves eternal fame?
Or else because Apollo great, does dearly love the same?
Or that it sacred is? or else all things of it must need?
Or else of peace the tokens plain, on total earth do spreede?
For as the Laurel green do grow, and never fades away,
So ^^^lesse honor here remaynes, which yeldes to no decay.
The letters eke which written be, about the stat^ly Crown,
The en^^gnes be of his defense, the Citizens have foun^.
One faithful man except alone who driven full far away,
Does lurk aloof in furthest land, oprest in deep decay.
W^o thoug^ he does confess himself to have deserved pain,
No wicked deed was cause thereof but error proved plain,
At royal place and mighty man, O wretch for ^eare I shake,
And doleful woeful letters small, through tremblyng dread do qu^ke.
Thou do behold to sickly hew, my paper pale do change,
And do regard each other foot, ^o ha^t with trembling strange.
And at what time before the lorde^ and rulers of the place,
In sight thou shall be set, I pray thee plead thy parents case.
From thence with slender paws^ng pace, to ^ofty steps was brought.
And stately Temples built on hie, of great Apollo sought.
Even where on mighty p^^^ers plain, the nob^^ picture stand.
Be^ides and the cruel sire, with naked sword in hand.
And where the ancient writers lear^de, with learned hand did write*
Which readers all may there behold, and there do stand in sight.
My brethren there I looked for, save t^ose I cold not ^^ide,
W^o^e birth the father did repent, and so did wish in mind.
And seeking there in vain abou e, the k^per of the place,
Did will me from those sacred staules, to pass with spedy pace.
To temples next which joined were, in haste I did depart,
From whence my feet were force to flee, for fear of further smart.
Nor that which w^nted was always, the learned books to take,
Would suffer me to touch the same, but clearly did forsake,
The heavy fa^e of wretched syers, to offspring does descend,
And fathers fearful flight to us, his children does extend.
Yet may it hap in time to come, through length of longer sp^^e,
That we and he of Caesar may obtain more milder grace
The Gods for this I pray, and yet (save Caesar none at all)
That they with heavenly ears attend to this our humble call.
And ^eyng that the public staules, to us denied dene,
In private place it may be free, to lurk therein unseen.
And you also ye simple hands (if it so lawful be)
Our careful verse receive likewise with modest e^s to see,
And was it then my desten^es, the Syrhean land to se?
And in that land that vnderlieth, the Northren poa^e to be.
Not to your poet sacred Nymphs, and learned cunning flock.
Have succor showed: which boast your self, of dame Dianais, stock*
Nor that deuoyde of very crime, I wrote did profit ought,
A^^ eke my muse more wanton far, then life I ever sought,
But after perils many past, by seas and land with pain,
I^ Po^tus I Will dryde up with cold, aye lasting I remain.
And I that borne to q^ter re^t, avoiding busy broyle,
Full tender and impacient was of labors p^nching toil.
Extremes I suffer now, nor me, the Seas depryu^e of port,
Nor sundry ways cold yet destroy by which I made resort.
But ils my mind resisted have, of which my body worn,
Repayres his force and suffers things, skant able to be borne.
Yet while with winds and whelming waves, I doubtfully am tossed,
My gryping cares and heavy heart, with travail great is lost.
But when my way was ended once, and Iourneing workegan rest,
And I a land wherein to wayle my grievous pain possessed.
Naught else but weep I would, nor from mine eyes a smaller shower,
Did flow: then when the spring time warm, does winter snow devour.
My house and Rome remember I with want of wonted place,
And whatsoever thing of mine does city least embrace.
O heavy chance so often ahlas, as I have knocked on gate,
Of greedy grave, but yet no time could enter in thereat.
W^y have I escaped so many swords, so often with threatnyng dread?
Why has not sturdy storm orewhelmd this my unhappy head?
O Gods whom I to wrathful, and in wrath to constant prove,
Pertakers of displeasurs which, one only god does move.
Have on, provoke I humbly pray, the ligring longed fates,
And let not death be hable e^t to shut his gries^^ Gates.
To his wife Elegy. 3.
IF maru^yle ought (my loving wife) thy m^n^e perhaps detayne?
Why others hand these letters wrote, my sickness caused plain.
In parts extreme of furthest land, with ^euer sore oppressed,
Of wonted health I was almost with deadly doubted distressed.
What mind thinks thou I had when as in region ^ude I lay,
(...) the Savvromes and the Getes, was forced here to stray,
The air thick could not be borne, nor waters used be,
And land it self I know not how to nature disagree.
No houses apt nor meat for such, whom sickness does agrieue,
Nor none that could by Phisickes art my deep disease relieve.
No ^r^nd that might my mind comfort, nor drive with words away,
The lingering t^me to pas with speed, and grievous p^ynes a^aye.
All ^yred thus in furth^st place and lands my byding have,
And each thing clearly wanting there, my longing mind do crave.
(...) t^o^gh not^ing my wish did want (O w^fe thou art most dear)
And of ^y br^st t^ou do poss^sse and hold the place most ne^re.
To t^ee alon^ t^ough ab^^nt ^at^e* my vo^ce by ^ame does call,
No day but (...) of t^ee I hea^e, nor found of ought ^t all,
And though (...) ^ymes occas^on mooues, to speak of other things,
As mad my ^ongue thy name does touch, and forth the same it bring^.
Yea though I sounded were and tongue, to mouth were fixed sure,
And that no drop of pleasant wynes, could ^ft the same recure.
Yet hearing that my mistres dear, to presence should be brought,
I ^ouse my self: for hope and cause of, strength thereby is wrought.
W^yle I in doubt of life r^mayne, thou passest pleasant days,
Unweeting clear of sorrows mine, percase thou none assayes.
Yet do thou not I dare, affirm: (O thou m^ dearest w^fe)
I^ sorrows sad me absent far, thou leads, thine only life.
But when as Fate m^ years fullf^^de, which it so ought of right,
And when as life my corpse has left, and death perform'de his spite.
What joy should it be then (O Gods) to grant to my des^re,
O^ N^tyue ground to end my days and course therein entyre.
O would that either these my pains, might yet have had delay,
Or else that hasting death had come, before I past away,
In health not long ago it might, my life have ta^e from me,
But now an exile here to dye, these pardons granted be.
So far away shall we be forced, to dye in Land unknown?
Or shall the place enforce my fate, with greater sorrows grown?
S^all not my corpse in wonted deds, consume with deadly wound?
Or shall there none my death bewail when laid I am on ground?
Shall not my mystresse sorry tears, upon my face let fall?
Nor shall the same with living sense, my time prolong at all?
Shall not I make my due requests? nor at the l^test cry?
With Friendly hand shall she not shut, and close my passing eye?
But shall my head of funeralles, bereft and noble grave?
And here in greedy ground be put, and no lamenting have?
Wilt not thou hearing this of me, with mind amazed stand?
And faithful breast with wayghty strokes, will strike with fearful hand
And hytherwardes in vain although, thy woeful arms stretch out?
And on thy wretched husbands name, to cry will nothing doubt?
Yet spare thy cheeks (mine own sweet heart) and lovely looks to rend,
This time not first that I from thee, was forced away to bend.
When as my country dear I lost, thinck then I did away,
The f^est and greatest death I do, esteem the same always.
Now if thou can: which thou cannot, (my best beloved wife)
Rejoice my death the end of woes, that so molested life.
And would my soul with body might, consumed be in one,
So then no part from flashing flames, escaped be alone.
For if the sprite do not depart,, but flies aloft in skies,
And that Pythagoras ancient sawe^, as false we not dispyse.
My Romayne ^oule shall wander th^n, even with the Scythian Ghost,
And ^ke among the ^urious spyrites, shall ^yde always at Ost.
Ye^ cause that all my lifelesse b^^n^s, b^ put in one small pot,
So shall I not although now dead, an exile be, I wot.
For no man did forbid, that when, Thiocles whi^om slain*
Antigones should bury him, though king denyde it plain.
And mix my boanes with poude^ dry, of sweet Ammomus tree,
And in the Subbu^^es of the town, let them reposed be.
And lette^s great in Ma^ble grau'de, with seemly verse devise,
Which on my Tomb the pos^ers by, may well discern with eyes,
EPITAPHE
Here Naso now be^old I lie, that wrote of tender love,
A Poet learnd, whose wits were cause* ye death did him remove
And who so here a lover comes, say thus, if Pain be none,
God grant that Nasoes boanes abide, in quiet rest ec^one.
On Tomb these shall suffice: but ^et, my books shall l^nge^ bide,
As monumentes of me, which that, no tract of time shall ^yde.
And those which Author hurted have, (...) hope I through the same,
My time shall more prolonged be, with much encrea^e o^ Fame.
Yet on my Corse the due desert^s of Funerals bes^ow,
And on the watery Garlandes see, thy bitter tea^es do flow.
And though the fire does my Corse, to ashes pale conu^rt,
Yet shall the sorry sparks approve, thy godly loving heart.
And now receive this l^st farewell, perhaps, that I shall ^^ke,
The which although to thee I send, my self cannot partake.
To his friend, that he should eschew the company of great men. El^gia. 4.
O Dear in deed always to me, but in this time distressed,
Now trusty ^^yde since myne^ es^ate, so sore has lied oppressed,
If ought thou (...) thy friend believe, well t^ught by practice proof,
Live to thy self, ^ro^ haughty names, of ^ight, f^te thou aloof.
Live to thy self, and for thy power, great nobleness esc^ewe,
Right noble is the Castle whence, this ^ruell lightning slew.
For though in hands o^ mighty men, to help alone it lies,
They do not help, but rather hurt, in worsest wicked wise.
The ship whose sail is stricken low, escapes the stormy blast,
But slacky sail and broad extent, more fear then lesser taste.
Thou see how Cork with little weight on top of water fleetes,
When heavy lead through paise* it self, and nets in bottom wee^es.
If I my self these warninges with, had warned been or th^^,
The town where right does will me dwell, pe^haps I should not mis.
Whilst yet with thee I dwelt, and whilst the p^pe^^ng wind be put,
This ^oate of mine, through calmy seas, her qu^et way she cut.
Who falls on even g^oun^ (as scant, the same does ever chance.)
So falls as when to earth it comes, may up again advance.
But that poor soul Elpenor fell, a down from height of Hall.
Whose mournful spyrite his king unto, appeared after fall.
What men^ it then that Dedalus, his wings could flicker safe?
And Icarus to larg^e seas, his name assygned gafe.
Forsooth because aloft this one* that other flew below,
For both of them did others wings, their sides upon bestow.
B^leeue me this wh^ hidden well: has lurkt, he lives well,
And each man ought within his lot, to him appointed dwell.
Eumen^des should not, ben^ Child^es, if his foolish son,
Had not so much ^es^red on, Achilles horse to run.
And (...) Father still had been,
His Son in fire his Daughters and in trees should not have seen.
So thou likewise for ever fea^e, to lofty matters high,
And draw together I thee pray, the sa^les of purpose ^igh.
For ^hou well worthy art forthwith, vnspurned foot to ^unne,
Thy course of life: and have thy fate, more favorably spunne.
With gentle love that I should pray, for thee thou do dese^^e,
And faithful ^ayth that will from me, at no time ever swer^e.
With countnaunce like my careful case* I saw thee (...) lament,
As well it may believed be, my face did repres^nt.
I saw thy tears with trickling fall, upon my vysage sad,
Which al at once were pou^ed forth, wi^h t^usty words ^hou had.
Now thou also thy F^iend remou'de, with diligence defendes,
And ^ls which scant may ^ased be, with mitigating mendes.
All void of Envy see thou live, wit^out renown dispatch,
Thy years in quiet and thy self, with equ^ll Friendship ^atch.
And love the name of Naso thine, which thing is yet alone,
Unb^nis^ed remaynes the rest* in Scythia s^as be gone.
In land which nearest ioynes to star, of E^yman^hus bear,
I bide, where frost congealed hard, the ground with cold do tear.
The Bospher stream and Tanais, with other lakes there be,
In Scythia sea and names a few, of place skant known to me.
And eke there is nothing save cold, which none can saulfely bide,
Alas how near the furthest land, approaches to my sydd.
But far away my country is, and far my dearest wife,
And what thing else besides these (...), was pleasant in my life*
Even so these things be absent as, the same I cannot get,
In body: but in mind they man, be all beholded yet.
Before mine eyes my ^ouse and town, and form of places show.
And every place together with, their deeds I shortly know.
Before mine eyes like as my wife, in present shape appears,
My state she grievous presses down, and up again she reares*
She absent greeues, but lighter makes, that lasting love she lends,
And heavy charge upon her ^ayde, she constantly defends.
S^ you (O friend) full firmly stick, within my fixed heart*
Whom I desyr^ to speak unto, by each man's name apart.
B^t faynting fear that is beware, my duty du^ does let,
And you I think unwilling would, within my verse be set.
A^ore you would and did regard, it as thy love most kind,
That in my vers^ the Reader might, your names so placed f^nde.
Which thing because is doubtful now, in secret breast each one,
I shall talk with and will because, of quaking fear to none.
Nor in my verse my hidden friends, betraying forth I will,
Express: if any privily, have loved love he still.
Know this although in Region f^rre, is now my resting place,
With all my heart you inwardly, I evermore embrace.
And by such means as each man may, relieve my ils I pray,
Your faithful hand to friend outcast, in grief do not denay.
So prosper fortu^e unto you, and happy still remain,
As never in like lot the same, to ask ye may be feign.
To his Friend. Elegia. 5.
OUr use of Friendship has been such, that thou with little shame,
T^rough small acquaintance growe^ before, might well have cloakt y^ same.
In former bands of friendships law, unless thou had ben tide,
When that my ship on safer stream, with happy wind did slide.
But when I ^ell, each man for fear, did shun my diepe decay,
And wonted friends their wyly backs, from me they turn'de away.
Yet were thou bold my blasted bo^nes, with flash of Jove his fire,
To touch, and to my heavy house, with willing mind retire.
That thou but lately knowneper^ourme, my elder mates refraind
Of whom s^ant two or three that now to me poor wretch rem^ynd.
The sorry lokes my self I saw, and gave to them regard,
The face with tears like mine embrewde, and palenes wel^^re maid*
Thy doleful drops I bear in mind, and woeful words echone,
In mouth the tears, in cares thy words, full deeply now be gone.
My naked neck with heavy arms thou friendly did embrace.
With s^ghing sobs did kisses heap upon my fearful face.
Yea absent now (O friend) I ^m by force of the protected,
Thou know y^ friend thy name enclud^s, which may not be detected.
And many tokens more I marked. of thy vncloak^d love.
Which in my breast I keep full close, and shall not thence remove.
God grant thou may in quiet state thy friends defend always,
Whom ^ow in better case thou helps of pains to have allay.
Yet if that any shall inquire (as like they will do sone)
What life I lead in this mean space by fortune all fordone.
Say that some little hope I have, that Gods will grant more grace,
From which do not withdraw thine aid if thou do come in place.
And whether it, I wrongful crave, or that I do deserve,
In what thou may help thou thereto, and do not lightly swerue.
And look what skill in cunning speech, thou learned have before
Hereon see that thou do bestow to help my cause ^he more.
How much a man more noble is, so much more free from ire,
In valiant heart is sonest quenched the rage of furious fire.
It does suffice the Lion fierce to see his enemy yield,
And not to s^re the couching foe, that prostrat lies in fyeld.
Yet does the Wolf and Bear dispoyle the yelding pray in place,
And eke each other bruttsh beast that springes of ruder race.
For what then great Achill was had in more renowned fam^?
And he at Troy old Priams tears, did not behold for shame.
Or Alexanders mercies great, full sure records we have.
By noble Pharos which does stand depaynted on his grave.
I know the rage of noble minds to mercy lightly go,
For Juno son in law he is, that was her mortal foe,
In fine of grace no signs I see, that dryues me to dis^rust,
For that my fault no death deserves, of l^wes that be so just.
I have no^ sought Augustus life, with treason vile to slay,
Of tot^ll earth the only head to whom all men obey.
I n^ught have said, for babbling tongue, have spoken ought an ^s^e.
If I therefore offended have the wine the c^user is.
M^ guiltles sight my pain have wrought, which I therefore do blame,
From loo^ing eyes my grief does grow, even thus proceeds the same.
Yet can I not my sundry crimes, defend against all right,
B^t part of them is error plain, and void of wilful spite.
T^is hope therefore remains yet, in time to get such grace,
S^ shall my pa^nes procure relief, by force of changed place.
(...) to me by shyning star, which shows before the Son,
(...) ^ed with horse lets go, this message might be done.
To his most familier friend. Elegia. 9.
OU^ league of Love (O dearest friend) in firmest friendship knit*
T^ou will not, nor if happly would, thou can dissemble it.
To me so long as lawful was, none other stood more dear,
N^r a^y was i^ all the town with me conioynde so near.
This love among the People thick, so openly was blowe^,
That almost more than thou or I, the same appeared known.
And kindness thine of gentle heart, unto thy friend aye pressed,
The man had throug^ly tried whom, thou, do love above the rest.
Nothing thou coul^'st so covert keep, but I of counsel was,
And sundry secrets bear in breast, in common not to pass.
Thou only were the man from whom, no priuity I hid,
(That one except ahlas) which me all utterly undid.
Which had thou wist thy fellow should in sauegard thee have served.
And should (O friend) though thy advise, from saul^ty never swerued,
But me my de^tnies dyre did draw, unto this passing pain.
They surely shut each way to me, that profit could contain.
And whether I this mischief might, in being ware avoid,
Or else the ways which dest^^es will, by no means be destroyde,
Yet thou to us that fixed art, with long acquayntaunce fast,
Welneere are greatest part I want, of all my pleasures past.
Remember now if favor can, thy power ought increase,
To prove what it for me may do, we pray thee never cease.
That G^dhead once offended would, his anger somewhat frayne,
That place appoyncted changed eft, might partly ease my pain.
That if with sinful wickedness, my breast do not abound,
And error be beginner of, my chief accus^ng found.
M^ mind as his most hurtful wound, does fear that f^lthy time,
Thy g^^efe again renueth eke, remembering of the crime.
And whatsoever able is, me with such shame to spite,
I^ should behoue it hydden were in darkesome closed night,
Naught else therefore declare I will, save only st^'de I have,
But in such sin, no rich rew^rde, nor other gain to crave.
And this my fault men rightly may, and ought my folly name,
If very names and true to things, they aptly seek to frame.
Which i^ they be not even so, then look the ^urthest cost,
For my abode, let this land be, my subburbes uttermost.
To his daughter. Elegy. 7.
YOu written letters now prepare, the Harolds of my m^nde,
To see Pe^hilla how she fares, with have I have ass^ngde.
You shall her ^inde, full sadly set, fast by her mother swee^e,
Or else among her books alone, an^ learned muses me^te.
But when she knows that tho^ ar^ come* (all st^^yes set ^side)
What thing I do* she w^^l demand, and in what state I abide.
Then shall thou say I live, althoug^ not so as live I would
Nor ^rac^ of ti^e (...) brought relie^e, as hope has hop^ it should*
To muses ye^ (though hurt they ha^^) again I do re^^re,
And vers^s eke of wrested words, to make I have desire.
But tell me now? to studies old, do thou thy mind apply?
To lea^ned verse thy father like, will thou thy self affy?
For n^^ure with the friendly fates, has given thee manners chaste,
And sundry gifts but rarely seen* with wit good store thou have.
To Pegase ^^^asaunt springes, my self, of purpose brought the first,
Least that the vein of facund speech, might per^she else for thyrst.
In chastest years I noted well the aptnes of thy brain,
And as thy father did thee guide, the way to learning plain.
Even then I say (but love perhaps, with time is driven away)
A passing love to thee I had, which hardly could decay.
Wherefore if self same sparks of wit, in thee do still remain,
But only Sapphoes learned works, shall thine in skill disdain.
And now I fear least my mishaps, might thee percase appall,
Or through the same some dolenes may within thy breast befall.
While time did serve thy verse to me, and mine to thee I red,
And now as Judge I was, and now, as tutor I thee led.
Or else sometimes with verses made, thine ^ares I did aproue,
Or f^nding fault: in blushing cheeks, thy blood some^imes did move.
Like me perchance, for that my book^s, have hindered me ^o sore,
For fear of like misch^unce thou will, thy studies le^ue therefore.
Nay fear thou not Perhilla dear, this doubting dred remove,
So that no man of that thy verse, nor woman lea^ne to ^oue.

Who s^ill ^raw^s nea^e with st^l^hy steps, to work thy grievous spite.
I^ will thee gri^ue when some s^all say, this wight s^e has been fair,
And looking in the wonted glass, for sorrow shall despair.

In sight at last her brother saw, amids her deepest doubt.
Whom when she spide, forthwith she said* I dare us well assure.
My br^thers death the cause shall be, our safety to procure.
He all unawares and dreading naught, her cancred cruel spite,
Into his s^de her bloody sword she thrust with raging might.
Her blade plucked back from gored side, she rent with ruthful wound,
And members ^inste in pieces small, she cast about the ground.
And that her father might this know, on rock whereby she past,
H^s woeful hands and bloody head, with slight she fixed fast.
With wayling new her aged sire, for this did make delay,
And sob^ing sore the flesh took up, she safely escaped away.
Hereof this town is Tomos hight, for that upon this soil,
The sister did her brothers corse, in sundry parts dispoyle.
With what Nations he lives. Elegy. 10.
IF any there remember yet, me Naso sent away,
And in the City void of me, my name remaining stay.
Know he in mids of Barbary* vnblisfull man I brea^h.
Where fixed stars do never stoop, to subject Seas beneath.
The Sauromat^ a Nat^ons fierce, the Bessians, and the Geres,
Which names unworthy are my wit adjoining have their seats.
Y^^ while the weather dureth warm, is Ister our defense,
He wyt^ his liquid wa^^rs went, repelles the battles hence.
But when th'unpleasaunt winter comes, puts out his ugly face,
And all the land be sprinkled while, to marble frost geeu^ place.
While Boreas blows and while the snow, lies cast from Northre^ pole
Then is it plain these people are, opr^st with plane^ cool.
The snow does lie, which lying can no Sun or showers thowe,
Tha^ fryzing blast indu^ate makes, to s^yning Crystal grow.
And on the f^^st vnmelted yet an other falls as ^ast.
In diverse places wonted and twice twelve months wholly last.
So hide^us force has violent wind from Northward heather sent,
The lofty Tower^ it equal lay^s, with ground and houses rent,
With Mantles made of heary skins, ^xpell thy feru^nt could,
And only of their bodies all, their faces open hold:
Their busshes often with Icy drop^, do make ^ tinkelinge dinne,
Their beards with frost be bright e^bru'd, all ho^ry at their chi^ne.
The cleared wines in form stand up, like s^ards of chiuered tyle,
Nor dr^ughts they drink but gladly will, with goblets ^hrust b^gull^.
What should I tell how rivers all, with could congealed stand?
And how the brittle waters be, c^st up with digging hand?
The some no straighter then the stream, of Nylus bearing reed,
Which parted into sun^ry gulfes, in U^sty Seas do spreede.
This Ister ^ies with parching blastes, his bluish liquor deep,
And forth in secret silent waves, to Sea in covert creep.
Now may men saul^ely walk on foot, where ships late passage h^d.
With could concreate on waters knock, the hooued horses sad.
And by such bridges newly built, on under sliding stream,
Sarmatia Oxen uncouth W^ynes draw for^h w^^h stretched te^ms.
Forsooth I shall scant be beleeu'de, but if rew^rd of lie,
Be any ther^ no witness ought that faith to r^tifye.
The Largie fr^at with frost we s^w, st^nd still and never flow,
And slippery shell did under keep, unmoved surges low^.
Nor so contented to have seen, the hardened seas we trod,
When vpmost waves bene^th my f^ete, not weetinge them abode.
If such a on^ sometime had b^ne, to the Leander kind,
In narrow Seas no fault thy death, or cause of crime could find.
Then n^yther can the Dolphin fis^e, in springing air attain,
Whom forcing fast aloft to skip, does wint^^ hard restrain.
And though Sir Bor^as blustering hurl, with winged wind displ^ied,
No surging billow boulteth up, from swallow surely st^ied.
The pitched pups enclosed stick, in Marble as it were,
No struglinge Oa^es through frosen flood, their course are abl^ sh^r^.
We s^we the fishes fastened fast, long clong in yses cliue:
Yet part of them even then also, perceived was to live:
If either r^ginge wind therefore, his sower s^ew^ at large*
In fryzing on the fle^ting floode, or else on Neptunes ch^rge.
A none on Ister made full even, with northren perie dry,
A b^rb^rou^ for on hasting horse, does rydinge hither hye.
A skillful foe in cours^ing^ steedes, and flyinge shaft a far,
Who does the ground that nearest lies, des^royi^ge always ^arre.
With flying fast some happily escape, while fields vnfended rest,
Such richesse as unkept remain, by robbers be possessed.
The Cattle and the creeking carts, small country richesse are:
And what so ever other store, the dwellers poor prepare.
Some captive taken are led with arms, hard bound behind at back,
With cou^tenau^ce tourn'de to land in vain, and houses which they l^cke.
Some st^^ken down full pitiously, with hooked shaftes do dread,
For drinching poison driven is, into the arrows head.
Look what they can not c^ry forth, nor drive, they quite destr^y,
This hostile band with wastinge fire, will coats unguilty noy.
Even then also when peace is preast, they quake in fearing fight,
Nor any man with culter keen, to plowe the ground delight.
This place the enmy ever see'th, or fear'th the same unseen,
The land vntil'd with baggage rough, over grown has long time been.
No pleasant Grape is hidden here in branch of viney tree,
No warm new wine the hollough trough, to ouerflow we see.
No a^les round this Regions bear'th, nor here Acontius sped,
Of any had: to w^^ght the verse, his loved mistress red.
In nak^d ^i^ld ye should behold, no tree ne bushes spread,
(O plac^s fa^^e unfit alas) for happy men to tread.
And though the world be stretched out, in compass wondrous wide,
For me this Land appoyncted is, my punishment to bide.
He inueygheth against the evil speaker. ^legie. 11.
WHo so thou art that wickedly, at my mishaps rejoice,
And me as guilty do accuse, and eke condemn with voice.
On hard a d flinty rock was borne: with milk there fostred long,
Of savage beasts, the heart more hard then is the flint so strong.
What greater mischief would thou wish? thy wicked ire content,
Or else what further ils could cause, thy poyson^d tongue relent?
In barbarous Land I liu, and Pontus Isle has me possessed,
The Archadian Bear has me also, and Boreas wind distressed.
What Nations strange no talk I have, nor use of language found,
Each place thereto on every side, with doleful dread abound.
And as the flying Heart once caught, do shun the bloody bear,
Or as the seely taynted lamb, the mountain Wolves do fear,
So I on every side beset, with men of martial Land,
Do likewise, dred, for plain I spy, my enmies hard at hand.
And though in deed the pain were small, my loving wife to w^nt,
Or else my Babes and Country sweet, a grief were deemed scant.
Nor any other ill at all, but only Caesar's wrath,
Do thou not think that Ca^sars ire, t^ough of vengance has?
Yet some there are that h^ply may my greener wounds (...) worse,
And can with facund mouth also, and pleasant speaking course.
Of matters plain to make a proo^e, each man a skill may show,
But what does need in weakened things* such puisaunt force to show?
A Glory great it is to race, the tower and lofty wall,
But other things of lesser force, all headlonge down do fa^^.
I am not he I was: why do thou spurn my shadow vain?
Of Ashes dead on stone consum'de, why do thou make again?
When Hector fought: he Hector was, but drawn among his fone,
With force of great Achilles horse, then Hector was he none.
And I my self as now not he: whom thou have known full plain,
Only now of him thou see, the shadow to remain.
(Why do thou beast) with bitter words, mine Image thus co^strayne,
I pray thee spare from restless sprite, these torments to refrain.
And think my faults to have been true wherewith thou chargest me,
And think the same been wicked all, and folly none to be.
And let me payn^s enough abide, to fill thy ^nuyous breast,
And let me still an Exile live, in place exil'de oprest.
My h^auy fate should mo^e thy heart, on pitties playntes to feed,
And yet from thee as bloody Judge, these Judgments do proceed.
Thou art more cruel far then was Busirides the king,
Or else then he that fretting fire, to bras^n Bull did bring,
Who (as men say this Bull did give, the cruel ty^aunt to,
Of Sycill Land: who with his words, did praise the same also.
The use of this (O king quod he) in price does fa^re surmount,
The outward form: for of the shape, make thou the least accoumpt.
On right sid^ lo thou open see, a place to stand in sight,
Wherein put such as sley thou will, to satisfy thy spite.
And that once done with sokinge coals, the closed man consume,
Who like a Bull shall rore right out, with ^orce of fretting ^^me.
For which my work a gwerdon dew, that I likewise may have,
Some just reward of thee (O Pr^nce) my paynefull wits do crave.
His tal^ thus done: the king stepped ^orth, thou worker of this pain,
Shall first (quod he) approve the same, and shell therein be slain.
Incontinent as he had taught, with fire ^ee saw him burn'de,
Who cruelly his manly voice to beastly blearinge turn'de.
But why spe^ke I of Sycill factes, these Scythian Getes among?
To thee O wretch my playnt I send, that for my blood do long.
And that thou may with guilty blood, aslake thy longed thrust,
At these my woes with hungry heart, rejoice with greedy lust.
On Seas and Land I flying fast, such grievous pains approve,
As hearing them to pytious tears, thy self perc^se might move.
If that Ulysses toils were set (believe me mine withal,)
Neptunus ire to Jove his ^rath, might be accoumpted small.
Do not therefore (who so thou art) my grief again renew,
Nor do not eft in grievous wounds, thy cruel hands embrewe.
And let the fame of former factes, forge^fulnes obt^yne,
So shall of those mine elder hurts one only skarre remain.
Thou kno^est full well the doubtful factes, do hurt or help at will,
Then fear^ thy self thy lot unknown, which may thee save or spill.
And ^^th th^^ now is come, which I did think could not have been.
Why have thou mind of my mishaps, thine own forgetting clean.
Yet need thou not to fear: our chance most grievous is of all,
For that where Caesar's wrath is set all ils thereto befall.
And that thy self may know, that I, unfeignedly do move,
These playn^s: I would to God thy self, might even the same approu^.
He defireth a gentler place of exile. Elegy. 12.
THe Western winds began slake the cold, and year away to pas,
And Scythian winter slacker seem'de, then wonted winter was.
And when the Ram on waters thin, that Helles rashly brought,
The lightsome day with darkened night, in equal length had wrought.
The children small and gladsome girls, in country fields up grown,
The Uiolets sweet at this time reap, where seeds have not ben sowe^*
The fer^^le f^eldes do florishe now, with flowers of sundry hew,
And babbling byrde^ with tongue vnt^ught, do chau^t with n^tes so new.
The Sallowe eke a mother vile her cruel deeds to hide,
Her neast by beams she makes close, and buildes by houses side.
The growing Grain in plowed fields, with Furrows laid unseen,
With slender spyere through tender earth apeer'th, with joyful green.
The Uines also (whereas they be) their buds from branches low
Do now bring^ out: in Scythia for, no Uynes at all do grow.
And whereas lofty woods be set, the Bows do spread from tree,
(For near to coast of Geta Land, no Trees discerned be)
Lo there this is the vacant time, for sport and pleasant plays,
And talking tongues in judgment haules, do cease for certain days.
On hynne^ghing horse with a^mour light, they bravely now disport:
And some to Ball, and some to Top, with merry mind resort.
The lusty youth ^^noynted long with thyn and slyding Oil,
Their weary limbs with water w^she, and rest from former toil.
Now triumphs are: with sounding voy^^, the Lookers on do cry,
From three fould stage the factions three, their favoring words let fly.
O four times blessed, and blessed more the number can make playn^:
That may the City free enjoy, and in the same remain.
But I the snow with Sun con^um'de O wretch do here approve,
And frosen Sea the yse whereof no fo^ce might thence remove.
No yse the same does now congeale, as wont it was to do^,
Nor herdmen way by Ister make, to Sauromathia go.
Yet if by hap that any Ship, arryue within this coast,
Or any stranger hap to be, in Pontus Haven at host.
In ha^^ I seek the shipmen out (and saluinge them before)
What ship or whence she coms I ask, or from what happy ^hore.
Then they (unless it marvel be) from some near joining Land,
Do answer make: from Nations far, to sail few tak'th in h^nd.
And seldom from Italia Seas do any passage take,
Nor in these ports from Haven so wide, no ship his byding make.
But if that any come that speak, the Latin or the Greek,
^ee^s for that more welcome much, such language I do seek.
It lawful is from mouth of Sea, and from Proponti^ long,
That men may sail with Northren wind, these Scythian seas among.
Who so he be may happily make, some whispering rumor low,
Whereby a part occasion geu'th, more fame thereof to grow.
Then do I pray him make discourse of Caesar's triumphs brave,
And eke what vows that duty driu'th, the Latian Jove to have.
Or else i^ that Germania land, which still rebell'th in field,
With careful mind at Captains feet, all prostrate now do yeld^.
Who does (which would my self had seen) of these things happily tell,
I pray him use as welcome ghest, the house wherein I dwell.
But well away is Nasoes house, now set on Scythia ground?
Or shall to help my pain wythall, a place therefore be found?
God grant that Caesar may command, not this my house to be,
But rather for the time a place, wherein to cha^^ice me.
To his birth day. Elegy. 13.
MY not all day (though more then need'th) ^o here behold I see,
But yet on Earth to have been borne, what does ^^pros^e me?
And why do thou O careful day, in wr^^ched years appear?
Which might before this exilde time, my life dispatched clear.
I^ any care for me thou cast, or shame had the possessed
Beyond my native ground pursu'de, why ^ast thou me distressed?
For in what place an infant first, thou knew at n^tall day,
In self same land me thinks thou should, have wrought my last decay.
And should have left me quite when as my fellows me forsook,
And there have wished me well to fare, with sad lamentinge look.
What do thou bear in Pontu^ land? does Caesar will thee go
In quakinge yse to wrack^ his ire, has he thee charged so?
And in despite of customs old, and honorable guise?
To see my back with garments w^ite, be clad Italian wise?
Or shall the smoking Aulters fume, with flowring Garlands bound?
Or else the graynes of Incence sweet, from flaching flames resound?
Or Sacrifice shall I for thee and offring^ due present?
Or shall our vows to mighty Gods be given wy^h whole assent?
I am not so disposed now: nor time is offre^ fit,
That I thy coming can rejoice, and sorrows quight forgit.
An aul^er fram'de for fun^rals, all decked with Cipres tree,
And flaming fyres for death prepar'de, is much more meet for me,
A Sacrifice to heavenly Gods no care I have to geeue,
For vows help not amids such ils, I fayt^fully be^eeue.
But if a live I ought of them, with painful prayers crave,
I wish that in this land of thee no ^ight man after have.
T^ his f^^end to def^nd his Book. ^l^gie. 14.
O Holy Poet prelate hig^, which learned men defendes,
What do thou now to woeful wit, that friendly help extendes?
As thou were wont in better plight always to succor me,
And now also least q^it I should, depart do thou foresee?
Do thou prese^ue my verses all* and in thy keepinge sa^e,
My woeful arts except alone, which Author hurted have?
Yea do thou so of Poets new, that careful will remain,
And if thou may my hapless name in City still retain.
My self enforst away to flee, my books yet nothing so,
Nor cau^^ by them committed is, to taste of masters woe.
The exil'de father does often times, to furdest Nations flee,
Hi^ children though in town^ to bide, as lawful is you s^e.
My verse my O^springe so I call, begot of mother none,
But like as P^llas whilom was, of Jove his br^yne alone.
To thee I them commit and sy^h, their Sire is wanted sore,
To thee that do protect the Babes, the burden is the more.
And three I have that my mishap, in case alike do prove,
The rest in open sight preserve, thou need not them remove.
And books thryce flu^ of shape tra^sform'de, which likewise I have left,
Which at their masters funeral, with force were all bereft.
That work might well if that in me my life so long had last,
From heavy hand amended more with greater fame have past.
But now all uncorrupted quite in peoples mouth does fall,
If that in peoples daily speech, my name be told at all.
And to my books I know not how, which hap into thy hand.
Add this: although now lately sent, from unacquainted land.
That who then reads in reading them, will presuppose before,
What time and restless place I had, appoyncted me therefore*
To writings mine more pardon far, a righteous Judge will show,
If that them made in exil'de time, and barbarous land he know.
In such mishaps he marueyle will, how verses I could write,
Or how my careful hand set forth, the words I did endite.
My sundry woes my wits have broke, of which long time before,
The fountain dry and sclender vain, appeared evermore.
Yet (as it was) with want of use, is now consum'de away,
And with long thrist to drines driven, sustered more decay.
No store of books to feed my wit, in Scythia coast be found,
But in their place the shootinge bows and arrows do resounde.
No learned mates for conference, do live within this land,
That has the skill my verse to read, or ears to understand.
No space is here to roame aside, that watch on wall which goes,
And gate vpshut keepers of the Getes, our deadly dreaded foes.
Enquiry often I make of words, of place or of some name,
Nor any man is present here, by whom I certain ame.
Not seldom I enforce to speak, to shameful to confess,
My wonted words will fail me then, which I forgetting cesse.
With Thracian talk and Geta rude, my ears be stopped quite,
Me seems now I able am, in Getian wise to write,
Believe me least with Latin they be mixed sore I dread,
And least my writing while thou vewe, the Pontus words do read.
And to my book such as it is, in reading pardon give,
And eke excused have the same, by lot of ly e I live.
FINIS.
