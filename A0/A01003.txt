TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE HIS VERY GOOD LORD, THE Earl of Devonshire, Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland.
IT may please your good Lordship: I cannot be ignorant, and ought to be
sensible of the wrong which I sustain in common speech, as if I had been
false, or unthankful to that noble but unfortunate Earl the Earl of Essex:
And for satisfying the vulgar sort, I do not so much regard it; though I love
good name, but yet as an handmaid and attendant of honesty and virtue. For I
am of his opinion that said pleasantly, That it was a shame to him that was a
suter to the Mistress, to make love to the waiting woman; and therefore to woo
or court common fame otherwise then it follows upon honest courses, I for my
part, find not my self fit nor disposed. But on the other side, there is no
worldly thing that concerns my self, which I hold more dear, then the good
opinion of certain persons; amongst which there is none I would more willingly
give satisfaction unto, then to your Lordship. First, because you loved my Lord
of Essex, and therefore will not be partial toward me; which is part of that
I desire: next, because it has ever pleased you to show your self to me an
honorable friend; and so no baseness in me to seek to satisfy you: and
lastly, because I know your Lordship is excellently grounded in the true rules
and habits of duties and moralities; which must be they which shall decide this
matter: wherein (my Lord) my defense needs to be but simple and brief:
namely, that whatsoever I did concerning that action and proceeding, was done
in my duty and service to the Queen and the State; in which I would not show
my self false hearted nor faint hearted for any man's sake living. For every
honest man, that has his heart well planted, will forsake his King rather then
forsake God, and forsake his friend rather then forsake his King; and yet will
forsake any earthly commodity, yea and his own life in some cases, rather
then forsake his friend. I hope the world has not forgotten these degrees,
else the heathen saying: Amicus vsque ad ar as, shall judge them. And if any
man shall say, that I did officiously intrude my self into that business,
because I had no ordinary place; the like may be said of all the business in
effect that passed the hands of the learned counsel, either of State or
Revenues these many years, wherein I was continually used. For, as your
Lordship may remember, the Queen knew her strength so well, as she looked her
word should be a warrant; and after the manner of the choicest Princes before
her, did not always tie her trust to place, but did sometime divide private
favor from office. And I for my part, though I was not so unseen in the world,
but I knew the condition was subject to envy and peril; yet because I knew
again she was constant in her favors, and made an end where she began, and
specially, because she vpheld me with extraordinary access, and other
demonstrations of confidence and grace, I resolved to endure it in expectation
of better. But my scope and desire is, that your Lordship would be pleased to
have the honorable patience, to know the truth in some particularitie of all
that passed in this cause wherein I had any part, that you may perceive how
honest a heart I ever bare to my Sovereign and to my Country, and to that
Noble man, who had so well deserved of me, and so well accepted of my
deseruings; whose fortune I cannot remember without much grief. But for any
action of mine toward him, there is nothing that passed me in my life time,
that comes to my remembrance with more clearness and less check of
conscience: for it will appear to your Lordship, that I was not only not
opposite to my Lord of Essex, but that I did occupy the utmost of my wits, and
adventure my fortune with the Queen to have reintegrated his, and so continued
faithfully and industriously till his last fatal impatience, (for so I will
call it) after which day there was not time to work for him, though the same
my affection when it could not work upon the subject proper, went to the next,
with no ill effect toward some others, who I think do rather not know it,
then not acknowledge it. And this I will assure your Lordship, I will leave
nothing untold that is truth, for any enemy that I have to add; and on the
other side, I must reserve much which makes for me, upon many respects of
duty, which I esteem above my credit: and what I have here set down to your
Lordship, I protest, as I hope to have any part in Gods favor, is true.

It is well known, how I did many years since dedicate my travels and studies
to the use and (as I may term it) service of my Lord of Essex, which, I
protest before God, I did not, making election of him as the likeliest mean of
mine own advancement, but out of the humor of a man, that ever, from the time
I had any use of reason, (whether it were reading upon good books, or upon
the example of a good father, or by nature) I loved my country more then was
answerable to my fortune, and I held at that time, my Lord to be the fittest
instrument to do good to the State: and therefore I applied my self to him, in
a manner which I think happens rarely amongst men: for I did not only labor
carefully and industriously in that he set me about, whether it were matter of
advice or otherwise, but neglecting the Queens service, mine own fortune, and
in a sort my vocation, I did nothing but devise and ruminate with my self to
the best of my understanding, propositions and memorials, of any thing that
might concern his Lordships honor, fortune or service. And when not long after
I entered into this course, my brother Master Anthony Bacon came from beyond
the seas, being a Gentleman whose ability the world takes knowledge of for
matters of State, specially foreign; I did likewise knit his service to be at
my Lords disposing. And on the other side, I must and will ever acknowledge my
Lords love, trust, and favor toward me; last of all his liberality, having
infeoffed me of land which I sold for eighteen hundred pounds to Master
Reynold Nicholas, and I think was more worth, and that at such a time, and
with so kind and noble circumstances, as the manner was as much as the matter:
which though it be but an idle digression, yet because I am not willing to be
short in commemoration of his benefits, I will presume to trouble your
Lordship with the relating to you the manner of it. After the Queen had denied
me the Sollicitors place, for the which his Lordship had been a long and
earnest suitor on my behalf, it pleased him to come to me from Richmond to
Twicknam Park, and brake with me and said: Master Bacon, the Queen has
denied me yon place for you, and has placed another; I know you are the least
part of your own matter, but, you fare ill because you have chosen me for
your mean and dependence: you have spent your time and thoughts in my matters,
I die (these were his very words) If I do not somewhat toward your fortune:
you shall not deny to accept a piece of Land, which I will bestow upon you. My
answer I remember was, that for my fortune it was no great matter: but, that,
his Lordships offer made me call to mind what was wont to be said when I was
in France of the Duke of Guise, that he was the greatest usurer in France,
because he had turned all his estate into Obligations; meaning that he have
left him self nothing, but only had bound numbers of persons to him. Now my
Lord (said I) I would not have you imitate his course, nor turn your state
thus by great gifts into obligations, for you will find many bad debtors: he
bad me take no care for that, and pressed it; whereupon I said, My Lord, I see I
must be your homager, and hold land of your gift: but do you know the manner of
doing homage in law? always it is with a saving of his faith to the King and
his other Lords, and therefore my Lord (said I) I can be no more yours then I
was, and it must be with the ancient sauings: and if I grow to be a rich man,
you will give me leave to give it back to some of your unrewarded followers.
But to return, sure I am (though I can arrogate nothing to my self, but that
I was a faithful remembrancer to his Lordship) that while I had most credit
with him, his fortune went on best. And yet in two maine points we always
directly and contradictorily differed, which I will mention to your Lordship,
because it gives light to all that followed. The one was, I ever set this
down, that the only course to be held with the Queen, was by obsequiousness
and observance; and I remember I would usually gage co^fidently, that if he
would take that course constantly, and with choice of good particulars to
express it, the Queen would be brought in time to Assuerus question, to ask,
What should be done to the man, that the King would honor: meaning, that her
goodness was without limite, where there was a true concurrence, which I knew
in her nature to be true. My Lord on the other side had a settled opinion, that
the Queen could be brought to nothing, but by a kind of necessity and
authority; and I well remember, when by violent courses at any time he had got
his will, he would ask me: Now Sir, whose principles be true? and I would
again say to him: My Lord, these courses be like to hot waters, they will
help at a pang: but if you use the^, you shall spoil the stomach, and you
shall be feign still to make them stronger and stronger, and yet in the end
they will less their operation: with much other variety, wherewith I used to
touch that string. Another point was, tahat I always vehemently dissuaded him
from seeking greatness by a military dependence, or by a popular dependence, as
that which would breed in the Queen jealousy, in himself presumption, and in
the State perturbation: and I did usually compare them to Icarus two wings
which were joined on with wax, and would make him venture to soar too high,
and then fail him at the height. And I would further say unto him: My Lord,
stand upon two feet, and fly not upon two wings. The two feet, are the two
kinds of Justice, Commutatiue and Distributive: use your greatness for
advancing of merit and virtue, and releeuing wrongs and burdens, you shall need
no other art or finenesse: but he would tell me, that opinion came not from my
mind, but from my robe. But it is very true, that I that never meant to inthral
my self to my Lord of Essex, nor any other man, more the^ stood with the
public good, did (though I could little prevail) divert him by all means
possible from courses of the wars and popularitie: for I saw plainly the
Queen must either live or die; if she lived, then the times would be as in the
declination of an old Prince; if she died, the times would be as in the
beginning of a new: and that if his Lordship did rise too fast in these
courses, the times might be dangerous for him, and he for them. Nay, I remember
I was thus plain with him upon his voyage to the Islands, when I saw every
spring put forth such actions of charge and provocation, that I said to him:
My Lord, when I came first unto you, I took you for a Physician that desired
to cure the diseases of the State; but now I doubt you will be like those
Physicians, which can be content to keep their patients low, because they
would always be in request: which plaineresse he nevertheless took very
well, as he had an excellent care, and was patientissimus very, and assured me
the case of the Realm required it: and I think this speech of mine, and the
like renewed afterward, pricked him to write that Apology which is in many
men's hands.

But this difference in two points so maine and material, bred in process of
time a discontinuance of priuatenesse (as it is the manner of men seldom to
communicate where they think their courses not approved) between his Lordship
and my self; so as I was not called nor advised with, for some year and a
half before his Lordships going into Ireland as in former time: yet
nevertheless touching his going into Ireland, it pleased him expressly and in a
set manner to desire mine opinion and counsel. At which time I did not only
dissuade, but protest against his going, telling him with as much vehemency
and asseueration as I could, that absence in that kind would exulcerate the
Queens mind, whereby it would not be possible for him to carry himself so, as
to give her sufficient contentment: nor for her to carry her self so, as to
give him sufficient countenance, which would be ill for her, ill for him, and
ill for the State. And because I would omit no argument, I remember I stood also
upon the difficulty of the action: setting before him out of Histories, that
the Irish was such an enemy as the ancient Gauls, or Britons, or Germans
were, and that we saw how the Romans, who had such discipline to govern their
soldiers, and such donatiues to encourage the^, and the whole world in a manner
to leauie them; yet when they came to deal with enemies which placed their
felicity only in liberty, and the sharpness of their sword, and had the
natural and elementall advantages of woods, and bogges, and hardness of
bodies, they ever found they had their hands full of them: and therefore
concluded, that going over with such expectation as he did, and through the
curlishnesse of the enterprise not like to answer it, would mightily diminish
his reputation; and many other reasons I used, so as I am sure I never in any
thing in my life time dealt with him in like earnestnes by speech, by writing,
and by all the means I could devise. For I did as plainly see his overthrow
chained as it were by destiny to that journey, as it is possible for any man
to ground a judgment upon future contingents: But my Lord, howsoever his ear
was open, yet his heart and resolution was shut against that advice, whereby
his ruin might have bin prevented. After my Lords going, I saw how true a
Prophet I was, in regard of the evident alteration which naturally succeeded in
the Queens mind; and thereupon I was still in watch to find the best occasion
that in the weakness of my power I could either take or minister, to pull him
out of the fire if it had been possible: and not long after, me thought I saw
some ouerture thereof, which I apprehended readily; a particularitie I think
be known to very few, and the which I do the rather relate to your Lordship,
because I hear it should be talked, that while my Lord was in Ireland, I
revealed some matter against him or I cannot tell what, which if it were not a
mere slander as the rest is, but had any though never so little color, was
surely upon this occasion. The Queen one day at Nonesuch, a little (as I
remember) before Cuffes coming over, I attending her, showed a passionate
distaste of my lords proceedings in Ireland, as if they were unfortunate,
without judgment, contemptuous, and not without some private end of his own;
and all that might be, and was pleased as she spoke of it to many that she
trusted least, so to fall into the like speech with me; whereupon I who was
still awake, and true to my grounds which I thought surest for my Lords good,
said to this effect: Madame, I know not the particulars of Estate, and I know
this, that Princes actions must have no abrupt periods or conclusions, but
otherwise I would think, that if you had my Lord of Essex here with a white
staff in his hand, as my Lord of Leicester had, and continued him still about
you for society to your self, and for an honor and ornament to your
attendance and Court in the eyes of your people, and in the eyes of foreign
Ambassadors, then were he in his right element: for, to discontent him as you
do, and yet to put arms and power into his hands, may be a kind of temptation
to make him prove cumbersome and unruly. And therefore if you would imponere
bonam clausulam, and send for him and satisfy him with honor here near you,
if your affairs which (as I have said) I am not acquainted with, will permit
it, I think were the best way. Which course your Lordship knows, if it had
been taken, then all had been well, and no contempt in my Lords coming over,
nor continuance of these iealousies, which that employment of Ireland bred, and
my Lord here in his former greatness. Well, the next news that I heard, was,
that my Lord was come over, and that he was committed to his chamber for
leaving Ireland without the Queens license: this was at Nonesuch, where (as my
duty was) I came to his Lordship and talked with him privately about a quarter
of an hour, and he asked mine opinion of the course was taken with him; I told
him: My Lord, Nubecula est, cito transibit: it is but a mist: but shall I tell
your Lordship, it is as mists are, if it go upwards, it may haps cause a
shower, if downwards, it will clear up. And therefore good my Lord carry it
so, as you take away by all means all ombrages and distasts from the Queen,
and specially if I were worthy to advise you, (as I have been by your self
thought, and now your question imports the continuance of that opinion) observe
three points: First, make not this cessation or peace which is concluded with
Tyrone, as a service wherein you glory, but as a shuffling up of a prosecution
which was not very fortunate. Next, represent not to the Queen any necessity
of estate, whereby as by a coercion or wrench, she should think her self
enforced to send you back into Ireland, but leave it to her. Thirdly, seek
access, importune, oportune, seriously, sportingly every way. I remember my
Lord was willing to hear me, but spoke very few words, and shaked his head
sometimes, as if he thought I was in the wrong; but sure I am, he did just
contrary in every one of these three points. After this, during the while since
my Lord was committed to my Lord Keepers, I came diverse times to the Queen, as
I had used to do, about causes of her revenue and law business, as is well
known: by reason of which accesses, according to the ordinary charities of
Court, it was given out, that I was one of them that incensed the Queen
against my Lord of Essex. These speeches I cannot tell, nor I will not think
that they grew any way from her Majesty's own speeches, whose memory I will
ever honor: if they did, she is with God, and miserum est ab illis ledi, de
quibus non possis quaeri. But I must give this testimony to my Lord Cecill,
that one time in his house at the Sauoy he dealt with me directly, and said to
me; Cousin, I hear it, but I believe it not, that you should do some ill
office to my Lord of Essex: for my part I am merely passive and not active in
this action, and I follow the Queen and that heavily, and I leave her not; my
Lord of Essex is one that in nature I could consent with as well as with any
one living; the Queen indeed is my Sovereign, and I am her creature, I may not
leese her, and the same course I would wish you to take: whereupon I satisfied
him how far I was from any such mind. And as sometimes it comes to pass,
that men's inclinations are opened more in a toy, then in a serious matter: A
little before that time, being about the middle of Michaelmas term, her
Majesty had a purpose to dine at my lodge at Twickna^ Park, at which time I
had (though I profess not to be a Poet) prepared a Sonnet directly tending and
alluding to draw on her Majesty's reconcilement to my Lord, which I remember
also I showed to a great person, and one of my Lords nearest friends, who
commended it: this though it be (as I said) but a toy, yet it showed plainly
in what spirit I proceeded, and that I was ready not only to do my Lord good
offices, but to publish and declare my self for him; and never was I so
ambitious of any thing in my life time, as I was to have carried some token or
favor from her Majesty to my Lord, using all the art I had both to procure
her Majesty to send, and my self to be the messenger: for as to the former, I
feared not to allege to her, that this proceeding toward my Lord, was a thing
toward the people very implausible, and therefore wished her Majesty
howsoever she did, yet to discharge her self of it; and to lay it upon others,
and therefore that she should intermixe her proceeding with some immediate
graces from her self, that the world might take knowledge of her Princely
nature and goodness, lest it should alienate the hearts of her people from
her. Which I did stand upon, knowing very well, that if she once relented to
send or visit, those demonstrations would prove matter of substance for my
Lords good. And to draw that employment upon my self, I advised her Majesty,
that whenever God should move her to turn the light of her favor toward my
Lord, to make signification to him thereof: that her Majesty if she did it not
in person, would at the least use some such mean as might not entitle
themselves to any part of the thanks, as persons that were thought mighty with
her, to work her, or to bring her about; but to use some such as could not be
thought but a mere conduct of her own goodness: but I could never prevail
with her, though I am persuaded she saw plainly whereat I leuelled: but she
had me in jealousy, that I was not hers entirely, but still had inward and
deep respects toward my Lord, more then stood at that time with her will and
pleasure. About the same time I remember an answer of mine in a matter which
had some affinity with my Lords cause, which though it grew from me, went
after about in others names. For her Majesty being mightily incensed with that
book which was dedicated to my Lord of Essex, being a story of the first
year of king Henry the fourth, thinking it a seditious prelude to put into the
peoples heads boldness and faction, said she had good opinion that there was
treason in it, and asked me if I could not find any places in it, that might be
drawn within case of treason: whereto I answered; for treason surely I found
none, but for fellonie very many. And when her Majesty hastily asked me
wherein; I told her, the Author had committed very apparent theft, for he had
taken most of the sentences of Cornelius Tacitus, and translated them into
English, and put them into his text. And another time when the Queen would not
be persuaded, that it was his writing whose name was to it, but that it had
some more mischievous Author, and said with great indignation, that she would
have him racked to produce his Author, I replied, Nay Madame, he is a Doctor,
never rack his person, but rack his style; let him have pen, ink, and paper,
and help of books, and be enjoined to continue the story where it breaks
off, and I will undertake by collecting the styles, to judge whether he were
the Author or no. But for the maine matter, sure I am, when the Queen at any
time asked mine opinion of my Lords case, I ever in one tenor, said unto her:
that they were faults which the Law might term Contempts, because they were
the transgression of her particular directions and instructions: but then what
defense might be made of them, in regard of the great interest the person had
in her Majesty's favor, in regard of the greatness of his place, and the
amplenesse of his Commission; in regard of the nature of the business being
action of war, which in common cases cannot be tied to strictness of
instructions, in regard of the distance of the place, having also a sea
between that demands and commands, must be subject to wind and weather; in
regard of a counsel of State in Ireland which he had at his back to auow his
actions upon, and lastly in regard of a good intention that he would allege
for himself, which I told her in some religions was held to be a sufficient
dispensation for Gods commandments, much more for Princes. In all these
regards, I besought her Majesty to be advised again and again, how she
brought the cause into any public question: nay, I went further, for I told
her, my Lord was an eloquent and well spoken man, and besides his eloquence of
nature or art, he had an eloquence of accident which passed them both, which
was the pity and benevolence of his hearers; and therefore that when he
should come to his answer for himself, I doubted his words would have so
unequal passage above theirs that should charge him, as would not be for her
Majesty's honor; and therefore wished the conclusion might be, that they might
wrap it up privately between themselves, and that she would restore my Lord to
his former attendance, with some addition of honor to take away discontent.
But this I will never deny, that I did show no approbation generally of his
being sent back again into Ireland, both because it would have carried a
repugnancie with my former discourse, and because I was in mine own heart
fully persuaded, that it was not good neither for the Queen, nor for the
State, nor for himself: and yet I did not dissuade it neither, but left it
ever as locus lubricus. For this particularitie I do well remember, that after
your Lordship was named for the place in Ireland, and not long before your
going, it pleased her Majesty at White hall to speak to me of that
nomination: at which time I said to her, Surely Madame, if you mean not to
employ my Lord of Essex thither again, your Majesty cannot make a better
choice, and was going on to show some reason; and her Majesty interrupted me
with great passion: Essex! (said she) whenever I send Essex back again into
Ireland, I will marry you, claim it of me: whereunto I said, Well Madame, I
will release that contract if his going be for the good of your State.
Immediately after the Queen had thought of a course (which was also executed)
to have somewhat published in the Star Chamber, for the satisfaction of the
world touching my Lord of Essex his restraint, and my Lord of Essex not to be
called to it, but occasion to be taken by reason of some Libels then dispersed;
which when her Majesty propounded unto me, I was utterly against it; and told
her plainly, that the people would say, that my Lord was wounded upon his
back, and that Justice had her balance taken from her, which ever consisted
of an accusation and defense, with many other quick and significant terms to
that purpose: in so much that I remember I said, that my Lord in foro famae was
too hard for her; and therefore wished her as I had done before, to wrap it up
privately. And certainly I offended her at that time, which was rare with me:
for I call to mind that both the Christmas, Lent, and Easter Term following,
though I came diverse times to her upon Law business, yet me thought her face and
manner was not so clear and open to me, as it was at the first. And she did
directly charge me, that I was absent that day at the Starrechamber, which was
very true; but I alleged some indisposition of body to excuse it: and during
all the time aforesaid, there was altum silentium from her to me touching my
Lord of Essex causes.

But toward the end of Easter term, her Majesty brake with me, and told me
that she had found my words true, for that the proceeding in the Star Chamber
had done no good, but rather kindled factious bruites (as she termed them) then
quenched them, and therefore that she was determined now for the satisfaction
of the world, to proceed against my Lord in the Star Chamber by an information
ore tenus, and to have my lord brought to his answer: howbeit she said she would
assure me, that whatsoever the did, should be toward my Lord ad castigationem,
and non ad destructionem, as indeed she had often repeated the same phrase
before: whereunto I said (to the end utterly to divert her:) Madam if you will
have me speak to you in this argument, I must speak to you as Friar Bacons
head spoke, that said first, Time is, and then, Time was, and time would never
be; for certainly (said I) it is now far too late, the matter is cold and has
taken too much wind; whereat she seemed again offended and rose from me, and
that resolution for a while continued; and after, in the beginning of Midsomer
term, I attending her, and finding her settled in that resolution (which I
heard of also otherwise) she falling upon the like speech, it is true, that
seeing no other remedy, I said to her slightly, Why Madame, if you will needs
have a proceeding, you were best have it in some such sort as Ovid spoke of his
mistress, Est aliquid luce patente minus, to make a counseltable matter of it,
and there an end; which speech again she seemed to take in il part, but yet I
think it did good at that time, and help to divert that course of proceeding
by informatio^ in the Star Chamber. Nevertheless afterward it pleased her to
make a more solemn matter of the proceeding; and some few days after when
order was given that the matter should be heard at York house, before an
assembly of Counselors, Peers, and Judges, and some audience of men of
quality to be admitted, and then did some principal Counselors send for us of
the learned Counsel, and notify her Majesty's pleasure unto us, save that it
was said to me openly by one of them, that her Majesty was not yet resolved
whether she would have me forborne in the business or no. And hereupon might
arise that other sinister and untrue speech that I hear is raised of me, how I
was a suter to be used against my Lord of Essex at that time: for it is very
true, that I that knew well what had passed between the Queen and me, and what
occasion I had given her both of distaste and distrust, in crossing her
disposition, by standing steadfastly for my Lord of Essex, and suspecting it
also to be a stratageme arising from some particular emulation, I writ to her
two or three words of complement, signifying to her Majesty, that if she would
be pleased to spare me in my Lord of Essex cause, out of the consideration she
took of my obligation toward him, I should recko^ it for one of her highest
favors; but otherwise desiring her Majesty to think that I knew the degrees
of duties, and that no particular obligation whatsoever to any subject could
supplant or weaken that entirenes of duty that I did owe and bear to her and
her service; and this was the goodly suit I made, being a respect no man that
had his wits could have omitted: but nevertheless I had a further reach in
it, for I judged that days work would be a full period of any bitterness or
harshnes between the Queen and my Lord, and therefore if I declared my self
fully according to her mind at that time, which could not do my Lord any manner
of prejudice, I should keep my credit with her ever after, whereby to do my
Lord service. Hereupon the next news that I heard, was, that we were all sent
for again, and that her Majesty's pleasure was, we all should have parts in
the business; and the Lords falling into distribution of our parts, it was
allotted to me, that I should set forth some undutiful carriage of my Lord, in
giving occasion and countenance to a seditious Pamphlet, as it was termed,
which was dedicated unto him, which was the book before mentioned of king
Henry the fourth. Whereupon I replied to that allotment, and said to their
Lordships, that it was an old matter, and had no manner of coherence with the
rest of the charge, being matters of Ireland, and therefore that I having been
wronged by bruites before, this would expose me to them more; and it would be
said, I gave in evidence mine own tales. It was answered again with good
show, that because it was considered how I stood tied to my Lord of Essex,
therefore that part was thought fittest for me which did him least hurt: for
that whereas all the rest was matter of charge and accusation, this only was
but matter of caveat and admonition. Wherewith though I was in mine own mind
little satisfied, because I knew well a man were better to be charged with some
faults, then admonished of some others: yet the conclusion binding upon the
Queens pleasure directly, volens nolens, I could not avoid that part that was
laid upon me; which part if in the delivery I did handle not tenderly, (though
no man before me did in so clear terms free my Lord from al disloyalty as I
did) that, your Lordship knows, must be ascribed to the superior duty I did
owe to the Queens fame and and honor in a public proceeding, and partly to
the intention I had to uphold my self in credit and strength with the Queen,
the better to be able to do my Lord good offices afterward: for as soon as
this day was past, I lost no time, but the very next day following (as I
remember) I attended her Majesty, fully resolved to try and put in ure my
utmost endeavor, so far as I in my weakness could give furtherance to bring
my Lord again speedily into Court and into favor, and knowing (as I supposed
at least) how the Queen was to be used, I thought that to make her conceive
that the matter went well then, was the way to make her leave off there; and I
remember well, I said to her, you have now Madame obtained victory over two
things which the greatest Princes in the world cannot at their wills subdue: the
one is over Fame, the other is over a great mind: for surely the world be now I
hope reasonably well satisfied; and for my Lord, he did show that humiliation
toward your Majesty, as I am persuaded he was never in his life time more fit
for your favor then he is now: therefore if your Majesty will not mar it by
lingering, but give over at the best, and now you have made so good a full
point, receive him again with tenderness, I shall then think that all that
is past is for the best. Whereat I remember she took exceeding great
contentment, and did often iterate and put me in mind, that she had ever said,
that her proceedings should be ad reparationem, and not ad ruinam, as who
says, that now was the time I should well perceive, that that saying of hers
should prove true. And further she willed me to set down in writing all that
passed that day. I obeyed her commandment, and within some few days brought
her again the narration, which I did read unto her at two several
after-noones: and when I came to that part that set forth my Lords own
answer, (which was my principal care) I do well bear in mind, that she was
extraordinarily moved with it, in kindness and relenting toward my Lord, and
told me afterward (speaking how well I had expressed my Lords part) that she
perceived old love would not easily be forgotten: whereto I answered suddenly,
that I hoped she meant that by her self. But in conclusion, I did advise her
that now she had taken a representation of the matter to her self, that she
would let it go no further: for Madame (said I) the fire blazeth well already,
what should you tumble it: and besides it may please you keep a conuenience
with your self in this case: for since your express direction was, there
should be no Register nor Clearke to take this sentence, nor no record or
memorial made up of the proceeding, why should you now do that popularly,
which you would not admit to be done iudicially? Whereupon she did agree, that
that writing should be suppressed, and I think there were not five persons
that ever saw it. But from this time forth during the whole latter end of that
Summer, while the Court was at Nonsuch and Otlands, I made it my task and
scope to take and give occasions for my Lords reintegration in his fortune:
which my intention I did also signify to my Lord as soon as ever he was at his
liberty; whereby I might without peril of the Queens indignation write to
him, and having received from his Lordship a courteous and loving acceptance
of my good will and endeavors, I did apply it in all my accesses to the Queen,
which were very many at that time, and purposely sought and wrought upon other
variable pretenses, but only and chiefly for that purpose. And on the other
side, I did not forbear to give my Lord from time to time faithful
advertisement what I found, and what I wished. And I drew for him by his
appointment some letters to her Majesty, which though I knew well his
Lordships gift and style was far better then mine own, yet because he
required it, alleging that by his long restraint he was grown almost a
stranger to the Queens present conceits, I was ready to perform it: and sure
I am that for the space of six weeks, or two months it prospered so well, as
I expected continually his restoring to his attendance. And I was never better
welcome to the Queen, nor more made of, then when I spoke fullest and boldest
for him: in which kind the particulars were exceeding many, whereof for an
example I will remember to your Lordship one or two; as at one time I call to
mind, her Majesty was speaking of a fellow that undertook to cure, or at least
to ease my brother of his gout, and asked me how it went forwards; and I told
her Majesty, that at the first he received good by it, but after in the course
of his cure he found himself it a stay or rather worse: the Queen said
again, I will tell you Bacon the error of it, the manner of these Physicians
and especially these Empericks is to continue one kind of medicine, which at
the first is proper, being to draw out the ill humor, but after they have not
the discretion to change their medicine, but apply still drawing medicines,
when they should rather intend to cure and corroborate the part. Good Lord
Madame (said I) how wisely and aptly can you speak and discern of Physic
ministered to the body, and consider not that there is the like occasion of
Physic ministered to the mind: as now in the case of my Lord of Essex, your
Princely word ever was, that you intended ever to reform his mind, and not
ruin his fortune: I know well you cannot but think that you have drawn the
humor sufficiently, and therefore it were more then time, and it were but for
doubt of mortifying or exulcerating, that you did apply and minister strength
and comfort unto him: for these same gradations of yours are fitter to corrupt
then correct any mind of greatness. And an other time I remember she told me
for news, that my Lord had written unto her some very dutiful letters, and
that she had been moved by them, and when she took it to be the abundance of
the heart, she found it to be but a preparatiue to a suit for the renewing of
his farm of Sweet wines: whereunto I replied; O Madame, how does your Majesty
conster of these things, as if these two could not stand well together, which
indeed nature has planted in all creatures. For there are but two sympathies,
the one toward Perfection, the other toward Preservation. That to Perfection,
as the iron contendeth to the Loadstone: that to Preservation, as the vine will
creep toward a stake or prop that stands by it, not for any love to the
stake, but to uphold it self. And therefore Madame, you must distinguish my
Lords desire to do you service, is as to his perfection, that which he thinks
himself to be born for: whereas his desire to obtain this thing of you, is but
for a sustentation. And not to trouble your Lordship with many other
particulars like unto these, it was at the self same time that I did draw with
my Lords priuitie, and by his appointment, two letters, the one written as from
my brother, the other as an answer returned from my Lord, both to be by me in
secret manner showed to the Queen, which it pleased my Lord very strangely to
mention at the bar: the scope of which were but to represent and picture
forth unto her Majesty my Lords mind to be such, as I knew her Majesty would
fainest have had it, which letters whosoever shall see, (for they cannot now be
retracted or altered, being by reason of my brothers, or his Lordships servants
delivery, long since comen into diverse hands) let him judge, specially if he
knew the Queen, and do remember those times, whether they were not the labors
of one that sought to bring the Queen about for my Lord of Essex his good. The
troth is, that the issue of all his dealing grew to this, that the Queen by
some flacknesse of my Lords, as I imagine, liked him worse and worse, and grew
more incensed toward him. Then, she remembering belike the continual, and
incessant, and confident speeches and courses that I had held on my Lords side,
became utterly alienated from me, and for the space of at least three months,
which was between Michaelmas and Newyears tide following, would not as much as
look on me, but turned away from me with express and purpose-like
discountenance wheresoever she saw me: and at such time as I desired to speak
with her about Law business, ever sent me forth very slight refusals; insomuch
as it is most true, that immediately after Newyeares tide I desired to speak
with her; and being admitted to her, I dealt with her plainly and said: Madame
I see you withdraw your favor from me, and now I have lost many friends for
your sake I shall leese you too: you have put me like one of those that the
Frenchmen call Enfans perdus, that serve on foot before horsemen, so have you
put me into matters of envy without place, or without strength: and I know at
Chesse a pawn before the king, is ever much played upon: a great many love me
not, because they think I have been against my Lord of Essex; and you love me
not, because you know I have been for him: yet will I never repent me, that I
have dealt in simplicity of heart toward you both, without respect of
cautions to my self: and therefore viuus vidensque pereo. If I do break my
neck, I shall do it in manner as Master Dorrington did it, which walked on
the battlements of the Church many days, and took a view and survey where he
should fall: and so Madame (said I) I am not so simple, but that I take a
prospect of mine overthrow, only I thought I would tell you so much, that you
may know that it was faith, and not folly that brought me into it, and so I
will pray for you. Upon which speeches of mine uttered with some passion, it is
true her Majesty was exceedingly moved, and accumulated a number of kind and
gracious words upon me, and willed me to rest upon this, Gratia mea sufficit,
and a number of other sensible and tender words and demonstrations, such as
more could not be; but as touching my Lord of Essex, ne verbum quidem. Whereupon
I departed, resting then determined to meddle no more in the matter; as that,
that I saw would overthrow me, and not be able to do him any good. And thus I
made mine own peace with mine own confidence it that time; and this was the
last time I saw her Majesty, before the eight of February, which was the day
of my Lord of Essex his misfortune. After which time, for that I performed at
the bar in my public service, your Lordship knows by the rules of duty,
that I was to do it honestly, and without preuarication: but for any putting my
self into it, I protest before God, I never moved neither the Queen, nor any
person living concerning my being used in the service, either of evidence or
examination: but it was merely laid upon me with the rest of my fellows. And
for the time which passed, I mean between the arraignement and my Lords
suffering, I well remember I was but once with the Queen; at what time though
I durst not deal directly for my Lord as things then stood; yet generally I
did both commend her Majesty's mercy, tearming it to her as an excellent balm
that did continually distill from her Sovereign hands, and made an excellent
odor in the senses of her people: and not only so, but I took hardiness to
extenuate, not the fact; for that I durst not, but the danger, telling her that
if some base or cruel minded persons had entered into such an action, it might
have caused much blood and combustion: but it appeared well they were such as
knew not how to play the malefactors, and some other words which I now omit.
And as for the rest of the carriage of my self in that service, I have many
honorable witnesses that can tell, that the next day after my Lords
arraignement, by my diligence and information touching the quality and nature
of the offenders, six of nine were stayed, which otherwise had been attainted,
I bringing their Lordships letter for their stay, after the Jury was sworn to
pass upon them: so near it went, and how careful I was, and made it my part,
that whosoever was in trouble about that matter, as soon as ever his case was
sufficiently known and defined of, might not continue in restraint, but be set
at liberty: and many other parts, which I am well assured of stood with the
duty of an honest man. But indeed I will not deny for the case of Sir Thomas
Smith of London, the Queen demanding my opinion of it, I told her, I thought
it was as hard as many of the rest: but what was the reason? because at that
time I had seen only his accusation, and had never been present at any
examination of his: and the matter so standing, I had bin very untrue to my
service, if I had not delivered that opinion. But afterward upon a
reexamination of some that charged him, who weakened their own testimony; and
especially hearing himself viua voce, I went instantly to the Queen out of
the soundness of my conscience, and not regarding what opinion I had formerly
delivered, told her Majesty, I was satisfied and resolved in my conscience,
that for the reputation of the action, the plot was to countenance the action
further by him in respect of his place, then they had indeed any interest or
intelligence with him. It is very true also, about that time her Majesty taking
a liking of my pen, upon that which I had done before concerning the proceeding
at York house, and likewise upon some other declarations, which in former
times by her appointment I put in writing, commanded me to pen that book,
which was published for the better satisfaction of the world: which I did, but
so, as never Secretary had more particular and express directions, and
instructions in every point how to guide my hand in it: and not only so, but
after that I had made a first draught thereof, and propounded it to certain
principal Councellers by her Majesty's appointment, it was perused, weighed,
censured, altered, and made almost anew, writing according to their Lordshippes
better consideration, wherein their Lordshippes and my self both were as
religious and curious of truth, as desirous of satisfaction: and my self
indeed gave only words and form of style in pursuing their direction. And
after it had passed their allowance, it was again exactly perused by the Queen
her self, and some alterations made again by her appointment: nay, and after
it was set to print, the Queen, who as your Lordshippe knows, as she was
excellent in great matters, so she was exquisite in small: and noted that I
could not forget my ancient respect to my Lord of Essex, in terming him ever
My Lord of Essex, My Lord of Essex, in almost every page of the book, which
she thought not fit, but would have it made, Essex, or the late Earl of Essex:
whereupon of force it was printed de noue, and the first copies suppressed by
her peremptory commandment. And this my good Lord, to my furthest
remembrance, is all that passed, wherein I had part, which I have set down as
near as I could in the very words and speeches that were used, not because
they are worthy the repetition, I mean those of mine own; but to the end your
Lordship may lively and plainly discern between the face of truth, and a
smooth tale. And the rather also because in things that passed a good while
since, the very words and phrases did sometimes bring to my remembrance the
matters, wherein I report me to your Honorable judgment, whether you do not
see the traces of an honest man: and had I been as well believed either by the
Queen or by my Lord, as I was well heard by them both, both my Lord had been
fortunate, and so had my self in his fortune.

To conclude therefore, I humbly pray your Lordshippe to pardon me for troubling
you with this long Narration, and that you will vouchsafe to hold me in your
good opinion, till you know I have deserved, or find that I shall deserve the
contrary; and even so I continue

At your Lordships Honorable commandments very humbly.

FINIS.
