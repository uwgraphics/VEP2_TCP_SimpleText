Emperor of ye heavens, King of all the Earth, Prince of the Seas, Lord and
governor of Hell, and all infernal and deep places, and generally of all the
whole world: seeing and perceuyng, the number of his people and subjects to
decrease day by day, by and through the continual Wars, that he heretofore
has had (and at this present still has) as well against the Turks, (...)

spedy and convenient remedy were not had on his behalf, after that he had
showed forth with unto us, this his busy affairs: required us here upon to
give and grant, a great and universal, general, full, and free Pardon and
remission, to al such persons, of what age, state, or condition so ever they
be, that will enroule, and enter them selves into his band, to serve him, Ebr.

to cast forth of his lands and Territories, all such kind of people as
resist his laws and Decrees, as well to convince al such by the most sharp and
cutty sword of lively and forsible word: as also (if need requier) by the
help of our seculer arm and Minister, our deputed liuetenant, I mean the
Magistrate. We therefore consyderyng these things, Romans 13.8 1 Pet. 2.1.
and wholly desyringe in our minds, the whole and entire augme^^^tion, and
enlargement of the Realms of our dear and well beloved son Jesus, and also to
continue and hold since the mutual amite that was begone between us, before the
beginning of the world. And also more and more to increase and further the
same. Have opned all the tresury of our heavenly Palace, to the furniture and
setting forward of the same. Geuyng, ordaynyng, and suffering this our public
Pardon to be (...) to every estate, and command by these (...) ^s, to (...)

We, knowing many great and heinous misorders and abuses to have been done,
and yet daily be done, in the Territories Lands and Lordeships of our
well-beloved son Jesus: Mat. 3. d. 2. pet. 1. d. 2. pet. 2. a.
Infidels, Idolatours, and peruers sects of perdition, under the shadow and
sign of Religion and holiness, to the great breche of his holy laws and
statutes, beside the infinitelesse and (...) of his va^es (...) ^ubiectes, of
ou^ great power and ^^ctoritee, and force, pe^ to the same (as well in his own
Realms, as generally through the whole world) to cause to cry, and
Proclamation to be made, to publishe to every one this great and general Bull
and Pardon, by force of these presents, whereto we will that no less faith
thereto be ioigned, then such as is allowed by us from the beginning.

Commaundynge further, on pain of Excommunication, and everlasting curse, all
Preachers to whom our letters shall be offered: Deu. 11. b
to read the same, and openly to publishe and Preach our Decree among all
people, and every nation. Also to specify to the hearers, Mar. 11. d.
ye great Privileges, pardons and Indulgences, that we have granted for ever,
to all such as shall employ their labors to convert others and them selves to
be apt vasicles of the same right dear and well-beloved Son Jesus, Mat. 18. c.
Mark. 1. b
of which Priueledges, benefits, and Pardons the true tenor follows.

Liberty to Read the holy Bible in every Language.
FIrst, all and every person, what estate soever he be, which shall or will
enrowle them, or be of the band of our beloved son, shall and may lawfully
have in their houses, carry abroad with them, read privately or publicly, by
day, by night, and at all times, Iosu. 1. b. 2. Tit. 3. d
a book called the Bible, containing the Old and New Testament. And to have
the same as well in French, Italian, Spanish, Hiealmayn, Duch, and English,
(...) as w^ (...) or La^^n. 1. Cor. 14.
So that it shall be fit for every nation to have the same in his vulgar
tongue, or in any other language, which he best understands, or wherein he
has most pleasure. All a^^ ^^ery fond and abu^ (...) ^ing to have, or read
the same, heretofore notwithstanding. For the forbiddynge to read, to have or
to keep the same Book in any vulgar language, was done by the devilish
devise of diverse destroyers, by the persuasion of heinous Hypocrites, subtle
seducers, idel Idolaters, and peruers Papists (as if we should once have
willed only to have had our laws red, and defended, and forbiden, to mark,
or understand the same) and therefore to signify further, we give full and
free Pardon of all syns remited or not remitted for seeing that al such read not
the holy book in vain, but that they rule their life and govern themselves
and theirs to the uttermost of their powers, according to the rules, Deuteronomy. 5. d
Mar. 16. d Iofue. 1.
and auctorites comprised in this said book, without bending either to the
right hand or ye leaft: Casting apart all men's tradicions (touching the rule of
souls) yea, what aparans of holiness soever they have, as well by doing of
mirackels, as other wise, Mat. 2. b Gal. 1. a. b
