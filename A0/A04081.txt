AN ACT FOR THE GRANTING OF EIGHT ENTIRE SVBSIDIES BY THE PRELATES AND CLERGY
OF IRELAND.
WHere the Prelates and Clergy of the Kingdom of Ireland, for diverse weighty
considerations, respecting his Majesty's extraordinary occasions, have lovingly
and liberally, given and granted to the Kings most excellent Majesty, Eight
whole and entire Subsidies, of Four shillings in the pound, to be taken and
levied of all and singular their promotions spiritual, within the same
Kingdom, at such days and times, and in such certain manner and form, and
with such exceptions and provisions, as be specified and declared in a certain
Instrument by them thereof made, and delivered to the Lord Deputy, under the
Seal of the most reverend Father in God, James, Lord Archbishop of Ardmagh,
and Primate of all Ireland, which Instrument is now exhibited in this present
Parliament, to be ratified and confirmed: The tenor whereof ensues in these
words, viz.

Illustrissimo ac potentissimo Principi, ac Domino nostro clementissimo, CAROLO
Dei gratia, Angliae, Scotiae, Franciae, and Hiberniae Regi, fidei defensori
etc. Iacobus divina providentia Armachanus Archiepiscopus, totius Hiberniae
Primas and Metropolitanus, cum omni observantia tanto Principi debito,
prosperum in hac vita successum, and in futura, aeternam foelicitatem.
Serenissimae vestrae Majestati, per publicum hoc instrumentum, notum facimus:
Quod Praelati and Clerus totius Hiberniae, in sacra Synodo Nationali, juisu
serenissimae Majestatis vestrae, in Ecclesia Cathedrali sancti Patricij
Dublinij, legitime congregati, recolentes multa illa and summa beneficia, quae
communiter cum caeteris subditis vestris percipiunt (veluti sunt purae
religionis exercitium, justitiae administratio, publicaque pax, in qua omnium
bonorum affluentia continetur,) and multo magis singularem Majestatis vestrae
zelum erga decorem domus Dei, and haereditatiam illam munificentiam, qua
ordinem Ecclesiasticum, Regia Majestas vestra, paternis insistens vestigijs,
prosequitur: non modo Deo Optimo Maximo, humillimas pro vobis gratias agendas,
and assiduas preces pro Regni vestri tranquillitate fundendas, sed etiam
gratitudinem suam aliquo judicio Regiae vestrae sublimitati testificandam
duxerunt, and Octo integra and ultronea Subsidia, unanimi confensu, nemine
prorsus dissentiente, Regiae vestrae sublimitati, alacriter concesserunt;
suppliciter Majestatem vestram rogantes, ut ex affectus largitate, potius quam
rei ipsius tenuitate, hoc officium suum metiatur. Tenor vero concessionis
praedictae, se habet in hunc quo sequitur modum.

Most gracious and dread Sovereign, we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects,
the Prelates and Clergy of this Church and Kingdom of Ireland, called
together out of the several Provinces of Ardmagh, Dublin, Cashell, and Tuam,
by the authority of your Highness Writ, and orderly assembled in a National
Synod, or Convocation, being lately dejected and depressed to the lowest
degree of misery and contempt, by the wars and confusion of former times,
having our Churches ruined, our habitations left desolate, our possessions
aliened, our persons scorned, our very lives hourly subject to the bloody
attempts of rebellious Traitors. And now by the piety and bounty of your
blessed Father, and by the gracious influence of your sacred Majesty, being
new enlived, and beginning to lift up our heads out of darkness and obscurity,
do freely acknowledge to your immortal glory, before God and the whole
Christian world, That as no Church under Heaven did ever stand more in need,
so none did ever find more royal and munificent Patrons and Protectors, then
the poor Church of Ireland. You have not only made restitution of that which
the iniquity of former Ages had bereft us of; but also as though you intended
to expiate their faults, enriched us with new and Princely endowments: All
which great Favors, do yet become more sweet unto us, whilst we entertain
them as pledges of your future vnexhausted goodness: And if we do not seriously
endeavor throughout our whole lives, to make vnsayned expressions of true
loyalty and thankfulness to your sacred Majesty, we deserve to be condemned
by men, and punished by God, as monsters of ingratitude. To which infinite
obligations, and many others, we may add your Majesty's inestimable goodness,
in providing for us your present Deputy, Thomas Viscount Wentworth, a Governor
so just, careful, provident, and propitious to the Church. Wherefore
considering the vast expense of Treasure by your Majesty, and your
Predecessors, for the protection and establishment of this Church and Kingdom;
We the Prelates and Clergy assembled in this National Synod, whose
dependence (under God) is wholly upon your Majesty: not as though our weakness
were able to contribute any thing worthy of the favorable acceptance of so
great and puissant a Monarch; but as an exemplary testimony of our loyal
affection: We your said Prelates and Clergy, with a general and unanimous
consent, agreement, and accord, most willingly and readily, have given and
granted, and by these presents do give and grant, to your Highness, your Heirs
and Successors, Eight entire Subsidies, of Four shillings in the pound, in
manner and form following, That is to say: That every Archbishop, Bishop,
Deane, Archdeacon, Provost, Master of College, Prebendary, Parson, and Vicar,
and every other person and persons, of whatsoever name or degree he, or they
be, within the Realm of Ireland, having and enjoying any Spiritual promotion,
or other Temporal possessions to the same Spiritual promotion annexed, now
not divided or separated by Act of Parliament, or otherwise, from the
possession of the Clergy, shall pay to your Highness, your Heirs and
Successors for every pound that he may yearly receive and dispend, by reason
of the said spiritual promotion, the sum of Four willings for every of the
said Eight Subsidies, and for the true and certain value of all the
promotions, and every of them, whereof the payment of these Eight Subsidies
shall be made, the rate, taxation, valuation, and estimation, now remaining of
Record in your Majesty's Court of Exchequer. And that hereafter shall come and
remain in the same Court, where no former valuation is there of Record already
for the payment of the twentieth part, granted unto King Henry the eight of
worthy memory, in the eight and twentieth year of his reign; concerning such
promotions as now be in possession of the Clergy, shall only be followed and
observed, without making any other valuation, rate, taxation, or estimation,
then in the said Record is, and shall be respectively comprised.

Provided always, that forasmuch as the twentieth part of the said rate and
valuation before mentioned, is yearly paid to your Highness, so as there
remains only nineteen parts yearly to the incumbent clear, these Eight
Subsidies of Four shillings in the pound, shall be understood and meant only of
every full pound of the said nineteen parts, and nothing for any other money,
not amounting to a full pound. And your Prelates and Clergy do also grant,
