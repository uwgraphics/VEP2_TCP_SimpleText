To the Reader.
IN this book are contained very many and strange effects and operations of
all sorts of simples, gathered by the long experience and travail of the
Author, so that for variety of things therein handled, it may be compared with
any that are written of the like argument. All which simples with their uses
are easily known, being plainly described in this book, and are gotten
without any great cost or labor, the most of them being such as grow in most
places, and are common amongst us. But for thy better direction, thou shall
understand (good Reader) that all the simples (except Oak, which being omitted
in the right place, is set in the end of the book) are set down in order of
the Alphabet, so that thou may without any difficulty find them by the
titles of the pages: and to every simple is annexed a brief Table of the
effects thereof. There are moreover two general Tables: the one at the
beginning of the book, containing all the simples in order, with numbers
directing to the several places where they are to be found: the other at the
end setting down the names of the diseases and other operations, having those
simples which afford any remedy for the same, added unto them in order so
plainly, as thou can not err therein.

The Garden of Health, containing a description of all sorts of Simples, with
their several virtues and properties.
Abracock. ( See Peach idem.) Acatia,
ACatia stops the Laske, and the terms, and sets the loose matrix in the
natural place being drunk with red wine. 2 It is good to be laid to serpigo
or wild fire, all inflammations and hot tumors, wheales, and hot blisters of
the mouth, and with eye medicines to heal inflammations, blastings and
swellings of the eyes being applied. 3 It makes the hair black being often
washed with the water wherein it has been soked: The leaves and tender crops
of Acatia do settle and strengthen members that are out of joint, if they be
bathed in a hot bath, or stewe made with the broth thereof. 4 Being ground with
vinegar, it abateth the pusshes of the lepry. (See Sloes.) 5 In plasters it
helps swellings, and humors in the eyes wonderfully, drink it for the
flixe, seethe it in the water of decoction of Pomegranates, or in vinegar, and
drink it to kill worms. 6 Use it in a pessary to stop the flowers, to stop
fluxes, use subfumigatio^s thereof, or else drink it. Seed distilling use
Acatia. 7 It helps the holy fire, apostumes and wounds of the eyes, it
stops the terms, it heals creeping sores, the falling of the matrix, it
stays vomiting, and strengthens the stomach, and cease pain. (See Sloes.)

Acorus, or Gladen.
Drink half a spoonefull of the powder of the Root with white wine, and use
it as much in thy pottage to heal the elfe cake and hardness of the side. 2
Stamp the root and streine it with some Rue and Mints in Ale, and make possets
therewith, and drink the ale of them to expel urine. 3 The broth of the root
procures urine, is good for the pains of the side, liver and breast, the
gnawing of the guts, drawings together or burstings, and for women's griefs as
Iris is, it wastes away the milte, and helps the strangurie, and the bitings
of serpents. 4 Drink a scruple of the root against all inward bruises with
four ounces of honied wine. The root is much used among preservatives and
Treacles. 5 The broth is good against the swellings of the stones, and all
hardness and gathering of humors being sodden in wine and laid to. 6 The
juice drives away the darkness of the eyes. 7 The root punned with a little
Verdigreice, a little of the root of great Centorie and a little honey, draws
forth all kinds of thorns, splints, and broken bones. 8 The root mixed with
vinegar and applied, does consume and waste cold tumors and swellings. 9 The
juice rubbed on the place, drives away and kills the stinking worms, and
mothes called Cimici. 10 Half a dram of the seed taken with vinegar wastes
and cures the hardness of the milce. 11 For the griefs of the liver and
milte, bruise one pound of Acorus, and steep it three days in vinegar, then
seethe it to the one half, then streine it, and put honey to it, and seethe it
again till the vinegar be consumed, and take of this Oximel daily in the
morning with the decoction of Acorus. 12 If any bear Acorus about them, they
shall not have the bloody flixe, nor the crampe. 13 Seethe Acorus in water and
use for the plurisie, the griefs of the chest or breast, and of the liver or
milte, the strangurie and painful making of water. 14 Stamp the root and
seethe it in water to the third part, and drink thereof three days, it does
wonderfully bring forth the urine, and heals the strangurie.

Note that the same root or herb is not to be used in Agues. Calamus
Aromaticus, or the root of Asarabacca may supply the want of it. (See in their
places.)

15 For the stitch in the side drink powder of it with a draught of Malmesie.
16 Toothache apply a piece of the root to the tooth that aketh. 17 For venom
or poison drunk, stamp Gladen that grows on hie ground and Dragons, and
drink it with wine. 18 To dry up wounds and to heal them up with clean
flesh, although the bone be bare, apply powder of the root with honey. 19 For
the dropsy in the belly and feet, and to kill worms, stamp a good quantity
of the root and streine it in white wine and drink it. 20 Flux to stop,
seethe bramble berries in water of the decoction thereof and use it, but if
thou have an ache, bathe in the decoction of it, or wipe thee over with cloth
weeted therein.

21 Iaundies, bath in the decoction of Gladen and Ciclamen, or stamp them and
drink them with water and cover thee to sweat. 22 Flowers to cause, make a
pessary of the root, and anoint it with oil de Bay or common oil, and cast
thereon powder of Wallwort, and put it in all night till it provoke it to
bleed. 23 Pricks and bones to draw out, stamp the root and apply it. 24
Drink it to heal bruisings. 25 Boil it in water or ale, and streine it with
honey, and boil it again, and scum it, and drink it warm in the mornings two
hours before meat to purge watrish humors, and for the dropsy. 26 The
conserve thereof made with the pappe of the roots, two or three times so much
honey or rather sugar, comfort the stomach, and nourishes and loses tough
phlegm downewardes marueilously, and is good for the sickness of the brain,
and sinews, and all diseases coming of phlegm, and opens the natural
course and the terms. 27 Stamp the root of Gladen, and drink it with stale
Ale, and the juice of Fumiterie morning and even fifteen days, and use this
ointment therewith, stamp snayles, and Red dock roots, and boil them with
Barrowes grease, and put thereto brimstone and Mercury ana, and anoint any
skab therewith, and be whole though it be of seven years continuance. 28 To
bring down the flowers seethe Gladen roots in strong vinegar or wine and
receive up the fume thereof into the matrix closely, etc. it never fails, and
therefore beware that you be not with child. 29 Face evil colored distill
the roots of Acorus, and of Turnips in a limbeck, and drink thereof five
ounces before meat fifteen days. 30 Stingings of serpents, apply powder of
the upper parts with wine. 31 To dissolve impostumes under the ear, boil the
roots and stamp them with salt, and apply them. 32 Belly bound, drink the
juice with the yolke of an egg hot as may be suffered. 33 Milt griefs,
drink it with wine, sight to clear put in the juice.

Adders tongue.
ADders tongue, stamp it with Swines grease, and apply it to all swellings,
inflammations, ringwormes, and shingles, and to heal all wounds and cuts with
speed. 2 It is singular good to heal wounds both inward and outward, and for
all burstings and ruptures being sodden in wine and drunk. 3 Sees it in
water, and drink it against all hot fevers, inflammations of the liver, and all
inward and outward heates. 3 Stamp it with swines grease, and use it to all
burning and spreading sores, hot swellings and impostumes, and the holy fire.
4 Apply it to a wound either green or dry to heal it speedely, drink the
decoction of it to heal al inward wounds and al other griefs. Apply it to the
new ruptures of children, and bind it hard with a trusse. 5 Sees it with
Sallet oil while it is green, and so it helps both swellings and sores,
wounds, etc. 6 Being wrapped in Virgins wax, and put into the left ear of a
horse, it causes him to fall as if he were dead, but being taken out, he
rises again.

Agarike. ( See Larch tree.) Agnus castus.
AGnus castus is a singular good remedy for all such as would live chaste: for
it withstandeth all filthy desire to lechery, it dries up the seed of
generation, whether it be taken in powder or decoction, or that the leaves be
strawed in the bed to sleep upon, and therefore is called chaste, clean, or
pure. 2 The seed drunk dissolueth all windiness in the stomach, intralles,
bowels, and matrix, and all other parts of the body, and opens and cures
all hardness and stopping of the liver and milte, and is good in the
beginnings of dropsies, one ounce being drunk with wine. 3 Taken by itself,
or with Peneroiall, it provoke terms, and so it does, put in as a pessarie.
4 Some mix it with oils and ointments that are made to heat, mollify, and
heal the hard and stiff members that are waxen dead, sleepie, benommed or
wearied, it cures also the clifts and chops of the fundiment and great gut
being laid to with water. 5 Agnus castus drives all venomous beasts from
where it is scattered or burned. 6 It heals all venomous bitings being
applied, or the seed thereof drunk. 7 It helps hardness, stoppings,
apostumations, and ulcers of the matrix, if women sit in the decoction or broth
thereof. 8 The leaves with butter do dissolve the swellings of the coddes
being applied. 9 A branch or rod thereof carried in the hand, defends the
bearer from chafing and weariness. 10 The seed drunk increases milk. 11
With vinegar and oil, it is good for the frenzy and letargie. 12 The leaves
sodden in wine and honey, heal the ulcers and sores of the mouth and gummes.
13 For satyriasis or standing of the yard, eat the seeds thereof, or seethe
it in wine, and plaster it to the reins and secret parts. 14 Agnus castus
sodden in vinegar with Fenell, is good against the dropsy. 15 Sodden in salt
water with Sage and Smallage, and the hinder part of the head washed therewith,
helps the letargie. 16 Being either drunk or carried about one, it takes
away lust. 17 A plaster thereof applied, helps the head ache that comes
of evil humors. (See Tutsan.)

Alecost, Costmary, or Maudlinwort.
ALecost, Costmary, or Maudlinwort, either alone or with Persnipseedes boiled
in wine and drunk, cures the gripings and torments of the belly or guts, and
the flixe. 2 The conserve of the leaves made with sugar, does warm and dry
the brain, and open the stopping thereof, and helps reumes and distillations
taken in quantity of a bean. 3 Used in meats, as Sage and other herbs,
especially in sallads and sawses (for the which it is excellent) it yeldeth a
proper sent or taste: Alecost and Maudlin be of equal virtues, they comfort
the stomach. 4 The juice drunk kills worms both small and great: it is good
for the cold mother, it strengthens ye stomach, whether it be drunk or
applied, and stays vomiting. 5 The herb strawed or burned drives away
serpents, and is good against their poisons. 6 Being sodden in wine and drunk,
it is good for them that have drunk Opium, or other venomous things, and for
biting of serpents, especially one dram of ye powder of the root thereof
taken in wine, with the like weight of the seeds of wild Persnips. 7 It has
the nature of Feuerfue in all things, and it is good for women to sit in the
decoction thereof to provoke sweat, and to draw down the terms, and avoid
the pain that comes by retention of them. 8 The same stamped and applied
takes away hardness and swelling in any place. 9 The flowers of Maudlinwort
sodden and drunk, kills great worms in the belly, causes sweat, and
opens the obstructions of the liver, milte, kidneis and bladder. The herb
sodden in water is good for the hardness and swelling of the belly and matrix.
10 The flowers sodden in lee, and the head washed therewith, takes away the
skurfe and skab thereof, and kills lice: the flowers laid among clothes,
defends them from mothes. 11 Stamp the herb with Melilote, and apply it
but once to cuts of veins to heal them: eat the powder thereof with honey
for the griefs of the mouth. 12 It heals the greefes of the breast and
lungs, it breaks impostumes, draws evil humors from the head, and is good
for the stomach. 13 Use it to draw evil humors from the eyes, and for the
griefs of the breast, lungs, stomach, and reins. (See Feuerfue.)

Stamp thereof, and put it into the ears to take away their noise and
sounding, and deafness. 2 For pain in the soles of the feet, prick the
leaves and bind them thereto to have present remedy. 3 The juice put into the
nose does purge the head. 4 For dalling and giddiness in the head, dip silk
or wool in the juice thereof with vinegar, and apply it. 5 For all pain in
the head, stamp the leaves with the white of an egg, and apply it. 6 Seethe

Angelica.
ANgelica is good against all poison and venomous bitings, so that it is better
to have it and Magistrantia, Louage, Gentian, Elecampana, Aristolochia, and
Petasites, then al Arabike and foreign wares. 2 It is called the root of the
holy Ghost, and of all heal: it expels poison and rotten blood, and warmeth
the body. 3 Half a dram of the root, with one dram of Triacle drunk with
three or four spoonefull of the water thereof, and the body well covered to
sweat, and forbearing other things three hours after it, drives forth the
plague, and delivers the sick body, if no Treacle can be had, take a whole
dram of the powder of the root. 4 The root smelled unto being steeped in
vinegar, and a little of the vinegar drunk fasting now and then in the plague
time, preserves the body from the plague. 5 The water or powder of the root
delivers the body from torments coming of cold, the pluresie, ruptures,
griefs of the lunges, whereof come grievous coughes, the dropping of the
urine, the strangurye, the stopping of the flowers, swellings and windines, and
such like, and so does decoctions and potions made with the root thereof
sodden in wine or honey. 6 Put the water into hollow teeth for their ache, and
into the ears for their ache. 7 Put the juice or water into the eyes to clear
them and sharpen the sight, and to take away the webs and mystinesse: put the
juice, water, or powder into old and deep ulcers, to cover the bare bones
with flesh. 8 Apply the water to the gout, sciatica, or any ache or bruises,
to dissolve humors that are gathered together: mix the powder with pitch, and
apply it to all venomous bitings. 9 The seeds have the same virtues that the
roots have: the roots, seed or water, is excellent good against all inward
diseases: it scowreth the gatherings of the plurisie when it begins: it
helps corrupt lungs, it is good against the chollike and strangurie, it
provoke terms, it helps inflammations and swellings. 10 Drop the juice of
the root into the eyes to quicken the sight, and to cleanse them from all
filth, and put it into teeth that ache to avoid the ache. 11 The water or
powder is excellent good against rotten ulcers and kankerous sores to cleanse
and heal them: put a piece of gold into the juice of Limons 24. hours, and
drink it with a little wine and powder of the root of Angelica, to help the
plague though all hope were past. 12 The root taken fasting, or but holden in
the mouth, preserves the body from all infection of the plague or poison. 13
If any be infected, let them drink one dram of the powder straightwayes in
Winter with wine, and with water of Scabious, or of Carduus benedictus in
Summer, or with Rose water, and cover him well to sweat both for the plague
and poison. 14 The leaves stamped with Rue and Honey, are very good for the
bitings of mad dogs, serpents, and vipers, if shortly after the hurt taken, the
party drink of the wine wherein the leaves or root have been sodden. 15 For
the pestilence, any sudden pestilent ague, or too much sudden sweating, drink
half a dram of the powder of the root with one dram of Treacle, and iii. or
iiii. spoonefull of water of the root, and cover thee well to sweat iii.
hours. 16 It is good for all inward diseases, especially such as come of cold
cause, and for women in travel, it expels wind. 17 The root or seed may
be sodden in wine or water as the disease requires, and so it heals all
inward ulcers, bruses, and congealed blood, and strengthens the stomach. 18
The powder of the root is good against all swooning passions of the heart, it
is gathered in Autumn, and kept two or three years, it cleanses the lungs,
breast, guts, reins and bladder. 19 The herb sodden in water, heals all
inward wounds, strengthens the heart, and dries up all superfluous
moisture, as the dropsy and tympany. 20 It helps against vomiting and
weakness of the stomach, and being sodden with Rue, honey and wine, it
delivers from the bitings of serpents, snakes, etc. and also any prick or
wound. 21 It quenches all carnal rage of youthful lust, if one eat half a
dram of it: it has many other virtues, for the which few herbs are to be
compared unto it. 22 Toothache put in a piece of the root, breath stinking of
garlike chawe it, it may be used for like purposes as Carduus benedictus. 23
Powder of the leaf or root cleanses and heals rotten ulcers, kankers and
sores, and covers the bones with flesh, (See Blessed thistle.)

Swooning and all passions of the heart, drink two ounces of Angelica water,
with a little Cinamom water, and one scruple of powder of the root sundry
mornings.

Apples.
APples: abhorring meat, make a syrup with the juice of sower Apples and of a
Pomegranate and Sugar and use it. Cut Apples thin as a penny, and seethe them
in a pan with Virgins wax, and eat it as hot as may be suffered to stop
the bloody flixe. 2 Mix Chalk with ye juice of Wildings or Crabs, and apply
it to take away any pain of burnings, and bledders, or blisters. 3 Roast
Frankincense in a red Apple, and apply it to the tooth ache. For horcenesse
roast a great Apple, and slice it hot into a dish of water, and eat it to
bedward, and cover thee well to sweat. 4 Stomach hot griefs, use confections
of Apples with sugar. Pare Apples and slice them and fry them with virgins
wax, and eat it hot to cure the flux diaria. 5 Cough, eat roasted Apples
with vinegar and Suger-candie. Worms, roast one penny weight of Aloes cicat. in
an Apple, and eat it three mornings. 6 Ears worm, make a ripe well smelling
Apple hollow, and apply it to the ear, and the worm will come into it.
Fluxes, apply plasters of sower Apples to the reins and navel. Fevers
continual, use bitter sweetes. 7 Bloody-fluxe, roast as much wax as a bean in
an Apple, and eat it. Seethe Apples to pap, and to vi. li. of it, put iiii.
li. of honey, and seethe to perfection and use it. 8 Eyes heat and running, cut
off the paring thick and apply the inside to bedward to help it speedely.
Cough, roast Butter, English Saffron, and as much Sugar-candie as a Nutmeg in a
great Apple, and eat such a one morning and evening. 9 Eyes to comfort,
distill a pecke of rotten Apples, and use the water. Roast iii. or iiii. grains
of Olibanum in a well smelling Apple on the embers, and eat it to break the
impostume of the plurisie, or any other with speed. 10 Seethe the inward
yellowe bark with wood, bone, or horn with Alome to color it yellowe. Face
and nose-red, distill the bloomes in Balnio Mariae, and wash with the water
morning and evening daily. Distill it when it is full blown. 11 To ripen an
apostume, roast an Apple in the embers, and mix it with butter and honey, or the
yolke of an egg sodden, and apply it. 12 For griefs of the breast and breast
bone, take out the core of a ripe Apple, and fill it with powder of Licoras,
and Galingale, or Cinamom and Honey, all well mixed together, and roast it and
pill it and eat it as often as need is. For the chincough and other like, and
for pain in the breast, roast sallet oil in a great Apple in the embers, and
apply it flat on the breast as often as need is. Liver hot, seethe the juice
of Apples both sower and sweet, with almost twice so much sugar into a syrup,
and take a little of it fasting daily with lukewarm water. 13 Apples do cool
and comfort the stomach, especially such as are sowrish, and astringent of
taste. 14 And they may be used in hot Agues, and other heates of the stomach
against thirst, but otherwise hurtful to the stomach, causing windiness and
blastings in the belly. 15 Sower Apples boiled and eaten cold after meat,
loosen the belly gently. Apples eaten before meat, do nourish very little,
because they be watrish. 16 The leaves are good to be applied to hot tumors
and apostumations in the beginning, and to wounds to keep them from evil
heat and swelling. The leaves, flowers, and buds of every Appletree, but
especially of the Quincetree, do stop and bind. 17 The tart and sower Apples
do bind, but the ripe Apples are of a contrary. They that are taken at the
spring engender choler, hurt all the synowes, and breed inflammations and hot
burnings. 18 All Apples hurt the synowes, the unripe are very noisome, if a man
eat, so that he fill himself with Apples, they engender the stone. 19 But
they are good for them that swoone, and have a weak heart. The pap of an Apple
with Rose water applied to the eyes, does quench their burning, and takes
away their redness. 20 Apples be good in winter, and provoke urine: eat them
with a little salt. 21 Tarts of Apples with Anniseedes, make a sweet breath: a
cold roasted Apple eaten to bedward, looseneth the belly. Eat Apples with
Comfects, Biskets or Carwayes after meat. 21 To keep Apples long, lay them in
honey, so that they touch not one another. Put frozen Apples into cold water,
and they will come to their own nature again.

open and comfort the stopping of the liver and the Iaundies. Apply the bruised
leaves to inflammations and hot swellings at the beginning, namely that Arache
of the Garden, and the wild Arache at the going away of the same swellings. 2
Apply it with honey, vinegar, and salt Peter, to the wild fire, and to the
gout: but the much use of Arache brings many infirmities. Stamp it with

places of women to amend the evils within, and to cease the pain forthwith.

nails, to loosen them without pain. 6 Seethe the seeds, and drink the broth
for shortness of breath, to expel worms, and to cause vomit. Eat the
herb for the heat of the liver. 7 Make pottage of Mercury and Arache, and
eat them often for costynesse and pinching pain of the bladder. Use pottage
of Beetes, Arache and Mercury, to be delivered of the Ague in short time. The
seeds purge the body both ways. 8 Stamp the leaves, and apply them to
kernels and freckles. Apply plasters thereof to curded milk in the breasts,
being sodden in water, and drink yt juice of Arache with thy brothe. 9 To
cause an easy vomit, and to cleanse the stomach, seethe the seeds in water

Cherytree.
CHerytree: Ringworme, and Tetter, dissolve the gum in vinegar, and anoint
therewith. 2 Strangurie, drink powder of the kernels with Gotes milk. 3 Eyes
mystie, dropping and red, put in water of the flowers distilled in May, morning
and evening cold. 4 Stamp the middle rind, and streine it with white wine,
and drink it iii. or iiii. times to void the stone, grauel, and urine
presently. 5 Stone, drink the gum dissolved in white wine. 6 Headache of

hot, use confections of Cheries. 8 Iaundies, seethe a handful of the leaves
in a pint of milk, and drink thereof a good draught morning and evening. 9
For the heat of the liver and stomach, and the hot fever, and to cause
appetite, eat conserve of Cheries in the mornings six hours before any other
meat. 10 For heat in the night by the fever, hold the conserve in thy mouth.
11 Fevers of hot blood, drink the syrup of Violets, and water wherein black
Cheries have been sodden. 12 Falling evil, drink the water of the leaves or
flowers. 13 The gum dissolved in old wine and drunk by sups, eases the
sharp arteries of the breast, and voydeth belching and lothing. 14 Sweet
Cheries eaten fasting with their kernels, loses the belly so strongly, that
the feet being sore shall be healed thereby. 15 Cheries sodden in vinegar
with Pears and drunk with Masticke, do greatly bind the bellye. 16 The
gum does mightily break the stone, and loose the gravel. 17 Make Conserve
of Cheries as of Barberies, but not with so much Sugar. 18 Cheries eaten before
meat, loosen the belly very gently, but they nourish but little, and are
hurtful unto moist and unhealthy stomakes, especially the small Cheries, which
do often breed agues, and other maladies. 19 The red sour Cheries do
likewise loosen the belly, and are more wholesome and convenient for the stomach,
for they do partly comfort, and partly slake thirst. 20 The black sour
Cheries do strengthen the stomach more then the rest, and being dried, they
stop the laske. 21 The gum of the mazer or wild Cherytree, of the Spanish
Cherie, and our common sower Cherytree is good to be drunk in wine for the
gravel and the stone, and excoriation of the throat, lungs, and breast, the
cough and hoarsenesse. 22 The water distilled of the fresh and new gathered
Cheries, is good to be powered into the mouths of them that have the falling
sickness, as often as the course of the fit does trouble them. 23 Cheries
breed good blood, cause appetite, cut phlegm and gross humors, expel urine,
and soften the belly, being eaten when they are fresh: and being condited with
sugar, they are good for them that be sick of inflammations and extreme
heates. 24 And being dried in an oven, they are good against all flures. 25 The
distilled water of the wild black Cheries, is good for them that have lost
their speech. 26 The gum dissolved in wine, is good for the old cough. 27
Tart Cheries be more wholesome then sweet, and eaten before meat, they mollify
the belly, and prepare digestion, and are most excellent in hot burning
choler, and are good also after meat. 28 The gum sodden in Wine and drunk,
helps old coughes, causes good coullour, sharpeneth the sight, helps
digestion, and cleanses out gravel from the reins. 29 The stones break the
stone, if they be eaten dry or made milk. Preserved Cheries and Plummes, are
without danger: but beware of surfeiting by Cheries raw.

Ellebore white.
ELlebore white, the root causes to vomit up mightily all superfluous,
slimie, venomous, and noughtie humors, and is good against the falling
sickness, frenzy, old pain of the head, madness, sadness, the gout, the
sciatica, all sorts of dropsies, poison, and all cold diseases that be hard
to cure, and such as will not yield to any medicine. 2 The root with oil or
ointments, is good against all roughness of the skin, wild scu^ffe, knobs,
foul spots and leapry. 3 The same cut in slices and put into fistulaes, takes
away their hardness. 4 The powder causes sneesing, and purges the brain. 5
The same put in as a pessarie, draws down the terms or dead birth. 6 The
same boiled in vinegar and holden in the mouth, swageth toothache. 7 And put

with meal and honey, kills mise and rats, and such like, and drives them
away: and likewise waspes and flies, if it be boiled in milk and they eat
thereof, for then they swell and break. It is not good to be given unprepared,
nor to young, old, or sick folk: they that be weak, that spit blood, or be
grieved in their stomach, nor to women with child, nor in winter, but in
summer only, and before supper. 9 Put it into the greater end of a radish root
one night, then press it hard out, and take one dram of it in milk or
frumentie to help the falling sickness, vertigo, melancholy, madness, white
leapry, winds in the guts, dropsy, tympany, goutes, quartens, cough, and many
such like griefs. 10 It is given fasting by it self, or with sesame seeds,
or with broth, or with sodden barley, or with mede, or with pottage, or with a
lentill broth, or any such like supping. 11 Some give it with a great deal of
broth or supping. 12 Some give a little meat immediately before it, especially
to them that are weak, and so it may be taken without ieopardy. 13 Vomit to
cause, put a suppositor of it into the fundament. 14 Steep the root 24.
hours in wine, or Oximel, and dry it, and drink half a dram of the powder
of it with wine to help madness, melancholy, and such griefs as be written of

brain and head. 17 The root sodden with lee, or mixed with any ointment

and melancholy to help madness and reume, and to work both upward and
downward. 22 It is corrected with long pepper, hysope, daucus, and aniseede.
23 It works better and with less danger, if it be boiled with the broth of a
Capon or any other meat, and then the broth drunk. 24 Head skalde, apply
white Ellebore with as much swines grease. 25 Vomit to cause, take one scruple
with pease broth, or one penie weight with some broth. 26 Steep two drams in
two ounces of aqua vitae, in a close vessel 14. days, then streine it and
drink two drams of it with one ounce of wine to comfort and purge the body. 27
Head worms and falling of the hair, stamp it with swines grease, and apply
it all over the head. 28 Head to purge, blow powder of Ellebore, Pepper, and
Castory into thy nose. 29 Mix the juice with course meal as it comes from

the navel to purge downward. 30 Leapry, or any other deformity of the
skin, seethe it with Louage and Fenell in wine, and wash therewith. 31 Steep

ye ears of oxen, sheep, and other cattle, helps them against the diseases
of the lungs, and draws all the corruption into the ears. 31 If in the

the corruption and infection as it does in beasts in the time of any murren,
infection, or rot. 32 Worms in the head, apply it all over the head with

Lettuce.
LEttuce does moysten and cool, and causes sleep, nourishes and breeds
good blood, it is better sodden then raw, except for the^ that are choleric. 2
Young Lettuce is good for the stomach, and increases milk in the breasts, but
when it is hard, it is both dry and bitter, and hotter, and breeds evil
blood, hurts the sight, and corrupts the sperme. 3 But being young, it
helps the ague, either raw or sodden being eaten. 4 Liver and milte stopped,
seethe it with vinegar and a little saffron, and eat it and drink the broth.
5 Liver and milte stopped, to breed good blood, and to help the fever tertian,
eat it raw or sodden with vinegar and sugar. 6 Dropsy, seethe it and mix it
with oil olive, and eat it with meats. 7 Stamp it with oil olive, and
apply it to apostumes to assuage them mightily. 8 Let milch women eat the
seeds to increase milk and amend the sight. 9 Drink the bruised seeds in wine

seeds with the milk of a woman that has a woman child, and the white of an
egg, and apply it to the forehead and temples to procure sleep. 11 Drink the
bruised seeds with warm water for the ague. 12 Drink the seeds to stay the
shedding of nature speedily. 13 Drink the juice fasting, and thou shall not be
drunken that day. 13 Pluck up Lettuce with thy left hand before the sun rising,
and lay it under the covering of a sick man's bed, (he not knowing thereof)
to cause him him to sleep: or gather five, three, or one of the leaves next
the stalk, and lay them under his feet, and as many next to the top under
his boulster, he not knowing of it, to cause him to sleep: it is not good for
women with child, or would be with child, to use Lettuce much, because it
causes barrenness, and makes the children raging of mind, and foolish, and
the same is evil for them that be short winded, flegmatike, or spitte blood,
being much used, especially raw, and in Winter. 15 Eat Lettuce after supper
to cause sleep. Use Lettise with vinegar, salt and oil to provoke appetite,
to temper the heat of the blood, to mitigate the heat of the liver and heart,
but the often use of it, does greatly hinder the increase of sperme. 16 Use
Lettuce in Summer with oil, vinegar, salt and sugar, to temper the heat of
the stomach and liver, but it is better sodde^ in broths, or in water, with
some rocket, onions, leeks, or garlike. 17 The seed drunk with ale morn and
even, voydeth lust, evil dreams, and flowing of seed. 18 Apply the green
leaves bruised to burnings, and scaldings before they be blistered, and all
hot swellings, wild fire, and shingles, drink the seed with wine against
the stingings of scorpions. 19 Lettise may be laid up and kept in brine. 20
Apply the seed with oil of roses to the stomach, to destroy the hot
apostume there. 21 Drink the juice or powder of the seed to heal the flixe.
22 Breasts sore, sees Lettuce and apply it hot: lust to abate, use the seeds.

Lettise in vinegar, and anoint thy forehead and temples therewith. 26 Sweating
too much, stamp linseed with Lettise, and apply them to thy stomach till thou
be well. 27 Cough of heat, and the urine red, make pottage with Lettuce, water
and butter, and eat them: for unkind heat of the stomach, drink Lettuce with
wine, or eat it daily. 28 Gomerpassion, drink the seeds with water. 29 Pissing
against will, drink powder of the seeds. 30 Canker fester, and fire of hell,
stamp Lettise with white vinegar, and apply it somewhat from the sore, and so
nearer and nearer. 31 Headache, mix oil of roses with vinegar, woman's milk,
and the juice of Lettuce, and apply it with linen cloth to the forhead and
temples, or stamp the seeds of Lettuce and smallach, with the white of an egg,
rose water, and woman's milk, and apply it to the forehead, temples and pulses.

Long rape.
LOng rape, Nauewe, or Nauet gentle, is in nature much like Turnips. The seed
is good against poison, and therefore used in Treacles, and preservatives. 2

sharpen the sight, smoothe the breast and throat, and heat the kidneis. They
be best twice sodden.

Breast to smoothe 3 Eyes dull 3 Poison 1 Throat rough 3
Louage.
LOuage: The seeds may well be kept three years. 2 Drink the seeds fasting
to purge both upward and downward. 3 And use them in glisters to ease ye gout
in the feet. 4 Steep them one night in wine, and drink it to expel the
terms, and dead youngling, but because the seeds be very strong, the seeds
of Anise and Fenell may be mixed with them in like weight. 5 Use the herb in
bathes, and rub well the body therewith to open the pores and draw forth
evil humors. 6 Seethe the seeds in wine or water, and drink it to open the
stopping of the milt. 7 Bruise the seeds with Cummin seeds, and drink them
in wine to mende the stomach and avoid wind in the belly. 8 Bruise the
seeds, and seethe them in wine with Galingale and Cinamom, to help the
griefs of the stomach, milt, and bowels, the pain in the belly etc. 9. Sees

hoarsenesse, and the dangerous swelling in the throat called the Squincie, and
wash the face therewith morn and even to make it fair. 11 The decoction of
the root, seed, or herb in wine or barley water, cleanses the lungs,
passages of the urine and terms, and does heal inward wounds. 12 Apostume and
hardness, seethe it and apply it. 13 Dead child, apply it warm to the belly
to expel it. 14 To skowre the reins and milt, to expel wind, and mende the
liver, drink powder of the seeds with some thin broth, or pearcing wine,
and so it expels the seconds. 15 The seeds eaten alone provoke vomit, but
used with Rue, it is good for the dropsy. 16 Let women drink the decoction of
the root for the health of the matrixe, belly, precordials and breast, it
warmeth and makes good concoction. 17 The powder of the root is as good sause
to all meats as Pepper that is brought out of far Countries. It is good for
a cold stomach, it helps digestion. 18 Drink half a dram of the root
in powder with good wine to cease inward pain, to expel urine, terms,
poison, and all things that Angelica serves for: the seed is more hot and
effectual in all things. 19 Iaundies, and Plurisie, gargarise with the water,
and also drink thereof. 20 The root may be condited in Vinegar and Salt, as
the root of Elecampana, and other herbs, and kept in store. 21 Bathe in the
decoction of Louage to expel the stone and urine, and to heat all inward
parts. 22 Stamp the root or seed, and apply it to any venomous bitings, or
stingings of mad dogs, or serpents. 23 Teeming women, use the roots and leaves
in meat and drink, and sweating bathes, that they may be purged rightly after
childebirth. 24 The Squincie is healed by continual drinking of the water of
it through the stalk of it. 25 The water cleanses the face and skin from
all blackenesse, spots, bruises, skarres, skabbes, and such like, being often
washed therewith, and it helps the exulceration of the mouth, throat,
fundament, and priuities, being applied with linen clothes. (See Angelica,
Parsley, and Smallage: for Louage is much of like nature to them.) 26 Use
powder thereof with powder of Cinamom for the windiness and ache of the
stomach and guts. 27 The root is good for all inward diseases, and so is the
seed, and may be used for Pepper. 28 The infusion or decoction of the seeds
with as much Fenell seed, or Aniseede streyned and drunk, works in purging
the body as does Parsley and Fennel. 29 Legs red, stamp the leaves and
stalks, and distill them in a Limbek, and bathe with the water, and apply it
with linen clothes. 30 Emerods, stamp Louage and Rue with honey, and frye them
and apply them. 3 Seethe it with Yarrowe in wine, till the third part be

33 Knees swollen, stamp it with Rue and Honey, and apply it. 34 Face to cleanse
and to make it white, mix the root with water and wash therewith, or drink
Borage in wine. 35 Rising in sleep, bear the seeds about thy neck. 36 Liver
and milt griefs, use the water or decoction thereof. Knees-ache sore and
swollen, apply it with rue, and honey thrice. 37 For the host, stamp the roots
and streine them with water, and drink it when thou go to bed. 38 Bladder

Lungwort.
LVngwort of the Oak, or of the ground made into powder and drunk with water,
is good for the inflammations and ulcers of the lungs. 2 Wounds bleeding, cast
in the powder to stop them and heal them. 3 Boil it in wine and drink it to
stop the spitting of blood, pissing blood, the flowers, the flux and
bloody-fluxe. 4 That of the oak joins and heals green wounds, especially
of the lungs. 5 Take Lungwott iiii. drams, Aniseedes, Fenelseedes, and Licoras,
ana ii. drams, ye lungs of a Fox i. dram, Elecampana a dram and an half, Sugar

Lupines.
LVpines: hair to fall and grow no more, apply the branne. 2 Morphue, mix

juice of Lupines. Head fistula, sees bitter Lupines in salt water, and put
vinegar to it, and streine it, and put in powder of Germander, and wash

the belly, with wool as often as need is. 5 Worms in children, kneade ye
meal with honey, and apply it to the navel. 6 Hands skab, wash with ye broth
of Lupines. Nauel swollen, (see in Flax.) 7 Belly worms and leanenesse of
body, mix ye gall of a Cow with a little meal of Lupines, and apply it with
wool iiii. or v. days. 8 Their meal taken with honey or with water and
vinegar, does kill and expel all kinds of worms, and so does the decoction
thereof drunk, or stamped and applied to the navel fasting. 9 The decoction of
Lupines boiled with Rue, and Pepper, and drunk, opens the liver and milt. 10
A pessarie of Lupines, Myrrh, and honey mixed together, draws down the
terms, seconds, and dead birth. 11 The decoction of Lupines does beautify
the face, and drives away all freckles, spots, and lentiles, and so does the
meal applied with water. 12 The meal, with meal of parched barley and water,
swageth all apostumes and swellings. 13 The same boiled with vinegar, swageth
the pain of the sciatica, dissolueth and consumes the kings evil or swelling
in the throat. It opens and breaks wens, botches, biles, and plaguesores.
14 Soke them long in water, till they have lost their strength or bitterness,
and then they may be eaten, and so they take away the lothsomenesse of the
stomach, and desire to vomit, and cause appetite, but they engender gross

Nigella.
NIgella or Gyth: Drink the seeds in wine to help shortness of breath, to
dissolve all windiness in the body, to provoke urine and terms, to increase
milk. 2 Drink it with wine or water, or apply it to the Navel to kill
worms, or anoint with the oil of the seed. 3 Drink one dram with water
against all poisons and venomous bitings 4 The fume thereof tosted or burned,
drives away all venomous beasts, and kills flies, bees and waspes. 5 Head
ach, apply it to the forehead with oil of Arios, and put it often into the
Nose against the Web and bloodshoting in the eyes in their beginning. 6 Put the
powder of it into a thin bag and smell to it often to cure all Murres or
Catarres and Poses, to dry the brain, and to restore the smelling being lost.
7 Boil it with vinegar and hold it in the mouth to swage the tooth ach. 8 Chew
it dry to cure the ulcers of the mouth. 9 For Lentiles, Freckles and other
spots in the face, to cleanse the skurfe and itch, and to soften old, cold
and hard swellings, stamp it with vinegar and apply it. 10 Steep it in old
wine or stale urine, to cause Corns and Agnailes to fall off, being first
scarrified round about. 11 Too much of it taken, brings death. 12 Apply the
seeds with Rose vinegar to the forehead against the Frenzy. 13 It serves
also for the same things that Coliander is good for. 14 Drop the juice into
the eyes, to heal the Epiphora, or dropping. 15 Stamp it with an Ox gaul and
apply it to the belly to kill worms. 16 Wild cockle that grows in corn, is
of the same kind, and the juice may be pressed forth as Opium, and kept for
medicin to cause sleep. 17 Nigella Romans provoke sneesing. 18 Ptisick, put
powder thereof in a linen cloth and smell to it often. 19 Brain feeble, mix
powder of the seeds with oil of Camomile or other oil, and drop thereof into
thy Nose in the mornings. 20 Put the flower thereof into the Matrixe, to draw
out all contents therein, as flowers, birth, seconds, etc. 21 To dry up milk
in ye breasts, seethe the seeds in wine and drink it. 22 Face pimples and
spots, grind the seeds with flower and Honey, and anoint to bedward, and in
the morning wash with Parsley water. 23 For fretting, roughness and skalie
spots, bruise the seeds and boil them to pap in vinegar, and then mix it
with oil of Nuts, and anoint therewith to bedward: the meal of Orobus will
do the same, mix the juice of the roots of Peonye. 24 Cockle drunk with
Radish and a little salt, heals the Kanker and other perilous wounds,
comfort the stomach and Liver, kills worms in the stomach, provoke
urine, and is good for the eyes. 25 The suffumigation of it makes women
fruitful without peril, and swageth the great pain of the Liver. A plaster
of the meal thereof with the juice of wormwood laid to the nauil, kills
worms. 26 The seed steeped all night in wine, and the wine drunk in the
morning, heals the strangury, dissurie, and Iliak passion: Nigella with
flower and Honey anointed, takes away spots and pimples, being after washed
with Parsley water.

Nutmegs.
NVtmegs does heat and strengthen the stomach that is cold and weak,
especially the mouth of the stomach: it makes asweete breath, withstandeth
vomiting, and takes away the Hicket howsoever it be taken. 2 It is good
against the pain and windiness of the belly, and stoppings of the Liver and
milt, and being parched or dried at the fire, it stops the laske, especially
being taken with red wine. 3 It is good for the mother, kidneys and bladder: it
helps the griefs that stop the urine in them that piss by drops, especially
when the disease comes of cold cause: it is good for other secret griefs,
both in men and women. 4 It breaks and expels gravel, especially being
first steeped or soked in oil of sweet Almonds. 5 It is used in cordials and
wholesome receipts against coldness of the Liver, cardiaks, stopping of the
milt, the dropsy, vomiting, headache, swellings, bloody fluxes: it comfort
the muskles and veins of cold and old people, it makes the breath sweet,
and puts away trembling of the heart. 6 The powder thereof mixed with oil of
Mints, and the forehead and temples anointed therewith, is good against the
coldness of the head or dullness of memory. 7 It is wholesome in Plasters for
the stomach, quilted in leather and silk. 8 It is good in stewed brothes for
them that are long sick. 9 The oil comfort the stomach that is cold. 10
But it is not good for sanguine men to use Nutmegs much, because it will adust
the blood, and makes the face seem as a visor of Coral. 11 The best Nutmegs
are red, fat, and heavy: the worst are black, light, and dry. 12 It takes
away fumes of the stomach, stops the belly, digesteth meat, expels
wind, and comfort the stomach and liver, and is good for freckles in the
face, and ringwormes: it minisheth the greatness of the milt, it softeneth
impostumes of the Liver, and is good for the cold diseases of the Matrixe. 13
Bruise fresh Nutmegs and heat them in a pan and press them, and there will
come out a salt oylish thing like wax, called of some, oil of Nutmegs: which
is precious for all cold griefs of the joints and senowes, and of diverse other
parts, and is good for cold husbands that would have children. 14 Nutmegs
comfort the brain, sight, liver, milt, and mouth of the stomach. 15 And taken
last at night in a cawdell of Almonds or of Hempseede procures sleep. 16 It
is the best spice for students of all other, taken in drink. 17 Nutmegs
condyted, as they may be had at the Apothecaries, are excellent. 18 Head ache,
drink powder of Nutmegs with Betony water. 19 If any man be wounded and bleed
inward, take the heauiest Nutmegs that can be gotten, wash them, wipe them,
and pare them, and let him eat them, and he shall deliver the blood outward,
and also by his ordure, and make him as clean as ever he was, so that the
wound be kept well, and the same used till he has recovered the state of
health. 20 Stomach feeble and cold, eat half a Nutmeg in the morning. 21
Boil them in wine and drink it for coldness of the stomach, and to help
digestion: or boil Nutmegs and Masticke in wine, and drink it for the griefs
of the stomach and bowels, and to break wind and to restore strength after
sickness. 22 Smell to a Nutmeg, to comfort the brain and spiritual members.
22 Stomach cold, sees Nutmegs, Maces, Fennel seed and Dill seed in wine and
drink it. 24 It is much of the nature of Cloves. 25 Mouth stink, use powder
of Nutmegs and Cloves, and forbear meats of evil digestion, and raw fruits.

Nux indica.
NVx indica: it increases seed, and moves Venus. 2 The oil pressed out of
it, is good for ye Emerods, especially mixed with oil of Peaches. 3 The same is
good for the ache of the knees and the Sciatica being anointed therewith, and it
kills worms.

Nuxmethel.
NVxmethel: Four grains with wine makes a man drunken, two drams kills a
man presently, both it and the Nux vomica are fitter to catch fish, then to be
taken into the body of a man: and whether fish or birds be taken therewith, let
their stomachs be taken out presently.

Birds and fish to take 1 Drunkenness to cause 1
Nux vomica.
NVx vomica either alone or with salt, causes a strong vomit. 2 It may be
taken with twice so much seeds of Dill or Fennel, and so drunk with water
warm, it causes vomit of choler and phlegm, and of some works downwards.
3 Pieces thereof eaten by crows or ravens, they cannot fly away but that you
may take them.

Oak.
Oak of Jerusalem or of Paradise boiled in wine and drunk, is good against the
stopping of the breast, shortness of the breath, and difficulty thereof, and
cutteth tough humors in the lungs and breast, and provoke urine and terms. 2
Dry it and use it in meats, as Isope, Thyme, and such like, and it yields a
good savor and taste. 3 Lay it into presses and wardrobes to defend clothes
from mothes, and to give them a sweet smell. 4 Drink it in wine to cleanse
the Lungs, and to help the cough, soreness of the chest, and shortness of
breath.

Olive.
Olive: The leaves applied, are good against serpige or wild fire, and
creeping sores, consuming Pocks, and such like hot humors and chollericke
swellings. 2 The same applied with Honey do cleanse ulcers and swage all other
tumors and swellings. 3 They are good against all ulcers, inflammations and
impostumes of the mouth and gummes of children, especially being washed with the
decoction thereof. The juice of them stops the terms and all other fluxes
of blood, taken inwardly or applied outwardly. 4 It is good also for redness,
inflammations and ulcers of the eyes, to be put into collyries and medicines
for the same, and to cleanse the ears from corruption. 5 The green and unripe
Olives do strengthen the stomach and cause appetite, especially being condited
in brine, yet they be hard of digestion, and nourish very little. 6 The ripe
Olives ouerturne the stomach, and cause wambling therein, they breed headache,
and hurt the eyes. 7 The oil of unripe Olives called Omphacinum, does stay and
drive away the beginnings of tumors and inflammations, and does cool the heat
of burning ulcers and exulcerations: it is good also against the rotten sores
and filthy moisture of the gummes, it fasteneth loose teeth being applied upon
the gummes with cotton or fine wool. 8 The oil of ripe Olives does mollify,
swage pain, and dissolve tumors: it is good against the stiffness of members
and cramps, especially when it is mixed with good herbs or flowers, for it
does easily draw out unto it the qualities of them, with which it is sunned or
other ways prepared or sodden. 9 The leaves of the wild Olive tree broken and
applied, do stay chollerike apostumes and inflammations, creeping and running
sores, apostumes of the corners of the eyes, carbuncles and whiteflawes. 10 And
applied with Honey, they take away crusts about sores and wounds. 11 They skowre
all filthy wounds, and drive away all inflammations, and sores called Pauos,
and join together the skin that is plucked off from the head. 12 They are
good for sores of the mouth, especially of young children, being chewed in the
mouth: and the broth has the same virtues. 13 The juice applied, stops the
terms, and is good for the disease of the eye, called Vua, and for wheales,
sores, and falling down of humors, and is therefore put into collyries and eye
medicines: it is very good for the gnawing or biting of the eye lids. 14 If you
will have the juice serve you all the year through, stamp them and put wine
or water to them, and dry the moisture in the sun, and make it into little
cakes. 15 But the juice that is made of the wine, is stronger to be laid up,
then that which is made with water: it helps the ears both if they be sore,
and the skin off, or any matter run out. 16 The leaves applied with Barley
meal, are good for the flixe. 17 The leaves are burned with the flowers, that
the ashes may serve in stead of spodium: and thus they be dressed, Put them into
an vnbaked pot that was never in the fire before, and stop the mouth of it
perfectly with clay, and let the pot stand so long, till all other pots be
baked enough, then quench them while they are yet hot with wine, and kneade
them together, and burn them together after the same manner once again, then
wash them and make them into little cakes: it is well known that this medicine
is as good as spodium in the diseases of the eyes. 18 The leaves of the set
Olive have the same virtues, but gentler. 19 The sweat or water that comes
forth of the tree when it is laid in the fire, heals foul skuruie skabs
being applied. 20 The seed of the Olive tree applied, helps skurfe and
fretting, and wasting sores. 21 That which is within the kernels, with fat and
meal, drives away skabbed or foul rough nails. 22 The Olives that have been
condited in salt, broken and applied to burnings, will suffer no bladder to
arise: they skowre foul wounds. 23 The bryne of Olives fasteneth loose teeth
and gummes being washed therewith. 24 The yellowe and fresh Olive is better for
the stomach, but it is hard for the belly. 25 The black, that is ripe, is
disposed to corruption, and is evil for the stomach, eyes, and head. 26 If it
be dried, it stops fretting or wasting sores, and scatters carbunckles: it
is good to wash the gummes that have filthy moisture, with the oil of wild
Olives, it fasteneth loose teeth being applied with wool or fine cloth, till
they be white, and it will help them. 28 No man can describe all the virtues
of the oil Olive. 29 Olives eaten before meat, loosen the belly, and
strengthen the stomach, cleanse the liver, etc. 30 Being eaten with vinegar,
they loosen the belly. 31 Oil Olive taken with as much Renish wine or white
wine, or powered in by Glister, helps much the Chollicke, Iliake, and pain of
the stone. 32 It may be eaten with white bread in sops in stead of Butter, and
so it looseneth the belly more then Butter. 33 Drink four spoones full with
as much Sack or white wine warm, to provoke an easy vomit, and to cleanse
the stomach. 34 Breath short or difficulty, dippe a sponge in hot oil and
apply it. 35 Chollike, sees raw yarne in ashes and oil and apply it to the
Navel and Reins. 36 Burning, boil Honey and oil togther, and anoint

or new milk, drives forth superfluities and chollerike humors, and is good
for the dropsy and Iaundies. 4 The oil drawn forth of it called Oleum

Pears.
Pears of all sorts taken before meat, do nourish but little, but yet more
then Apples, especially those that be great and sweet. 2 The sower, rough and
chokie Pears and others that are not watrie, eaten raw or baked before
meals, do stop the common laske, and strengthen the mouth of the stomach. 3
They are good to be laid to the beginning of hot tumors and green wounds,
and so are the leaves, for they close and heal new wounds. 4 To keep Pears
long, put them into a vessel that they touch not one another with fine white
salt and cover them close: put a Pare into wine, clean pared: if it swim, the
wine is pure: but if it sink, there is water mixed with it. 5 To keep Pares
dry, sees them in fair water and Rose water with Honey, with a gentle fire,
and let them dreine through a cloth or colander, and then dry them in an Oven

sodden Pares are a treacle or preservative. 12 Sodden or roasted, they relieve
and lighten the stomach. 13 After Pares drink, but after Apples go to the
stool. 14 All kind of Pares do bind as Quinces do, and therefore are
preserved in electuaries and syrops, to stop vomiting and fluxes. 15 The leaves
are good in baths to sit in, against the falling down of the Matrixe and other
griefs of women. 16 Plasters of the leaves are good to stop vomites and lasks.
17 Pares are worse then Apples, for being eaten raw, they make the blood
watrish, and breed wind and chollike, unless good Sack or Canarie wine be
drunk after them. 18 But baked, roasted or stewed, they are not unwholesome. 19
Pares and other fruits are to be eaten with salt, being first cleansed both
outwarly and inwardly. 20 Pares, Apples and Quinces, may be sodden to Pap and
streined, and to six pound of the Pap, put four pound of Honey, and seethe
them to perfection, and use it. 21 A plaster of young Pares that have been
transplanted, is good for the senowes that are pricked. 22 Vomit to stop, eat
sower bitter Pares. 23 Cough, seethe Pares in wine, Ale or Beer, and take up

Peaches.
PEaches before they be ripe, they stop the laske, but being ripe, they loosen
the belly and engender ill humors: wherefore they ought not to be eaten after
meat, but before. 2 The leaves open the stoppings of the Liver, and loosen the
belly gently, and are good with other convenient herbs against the tertian
fevers. 3 Worms, apply them to the Navel: dry them and straw them on new
wounds to cure them. 4 The kernels open the liver and lungs, and is of virtue
much like to bitter Almonds. 5 Steep them in water of Penyroyall, and use it

use the gum. 18 Fluxes, use the gum. 19 Belly worms, apply the leaves
stamped with vinegar, or anoint the Navel with the oil. 20 Scrophules,
Glandules or kernels, stamp the leaves with salt and apply them. 21 Iaundies,

belly. 23 Strangury, make powder of Peach kernels and Akornes of each like much,

PEony, the root endures ten years, it comfort and cherishes the body,
provoke urine, and purges the liver and kidneis. 2 The root boiled in wine
and drunk, purges the blood, and is good for women in child bed to purge
their seconds and terms without harm, as much as an Almond is to be taken at
once. 3 The root boiled in wine, does help the gripings of the belly, the
shedding of the gall, and the pain of the kidneis and bladder, coming by
stopping of the urine. 4 The smoke of the little branches of the root
received into the nose, puts away the Kings evil. 5 The root takes away
black spots of the body. 6 The root hanged about the neck, helps the
falling sickness, especially the root of the male Peony. 7 The root of the
female boiled in wine and drunk, does purge women after child birth, and so
does the seeds of it: and in other matters, the roots of both be of like
property. 8 The fresh root worn about the neck withstandeth the vapors
ascending into the head, and strengthens the brain: this does the male
which bears leaves like the leaves of a Walnut tree, and a white root of a
finger bigness a span long. The root is to be gathered in ye wane of the
Moon, and when she is under the earth, and the seeds do especially provoke
terms, and send out the dead yongling, and the seeds drunk in wine, do
help a hard delivery of a woman in travel. 9 The seeds bruised with
Setwell, Galingall, and Sugar, of each like much by weight, and taken every
morning and evening, does expel poison, and loosen the belly gently. 10 Ten or
twelve of the seeds drunk in old wine, do stay the superfluous course of
the terms. 11 And fifteen of the black seeds drunk either in water or
honey, or in wine, do help the nightmare, the strangling of the secrets, and

sickness. 14 Drink powder of the root with white wine to ease the pain of

with wine, cleanses the matrix after childebirth, and expels the flowers,
the stone of the kidneis and bladder, and is good for the Iaundies, and the
ache of the belly. 16 The water distilled of the roots and flowers,
strengthens the heart, and helps the falling sickness in children, being
taken two or three spoonefull at once. 17 The root and seeds hanged about the
neck of children, is good against the falling sickness, and the haunting of
the Fairies and Goblins. 18 The juice or powder drunk, is good against the
stopping of the gall, liver, and kidneis. 19 And sodden with old red wine and
drunk, it stops the bloody-fluxe. 20 The red grains do stop the red
menstrues. 21 And the black grains sodden in red wine, do strengthen the
matrix that abounds with flux of blood. 22 The root sodden in wine and
drunk, purges the belly, voydeth the chollike, cleanses the guts, and
defends against frensies and passions of the brain, the strangury, and
bitings of Serpents, but there must be taken at once but four drammes. 23
Drink the powder with white Wine and Saffron for the yellowe Iaundies, it is a
sovereign medicine. 24 Drink fifteen or sixteen of the black seeds in
wine or mede against the strangling of the mother, the nightmare, and
melancholy dreams. 25 Drink the powder with Sage, Rosemary, and Margerome in
Hydromell, or meats for the falling sickness. 26 The red seeds eaten, help
the gnawing of the mouth of the stomach. 27 Dropsy, put the seeds of Peony,
Anise, and Fenell into thy drink. 28 Falling evil, drink wine of the
decoction of Peony, or eat every morning and evening five grains of Peony
pilled. 29 Flowers stopped, seethe it in wine and drink it. 30 Mother
suffocated, drink fifteen grains of Peony. Use to drink powder of the
seeds with wine to restore the wits, and comfort the senses. 31 Wear the
seeds about thee, that no evil spirits do hinder thee. Drink powder of
ten or twelve seeds with Wine to avoid the nightmare. 32 Use powder of the
root with Sugar for the falling evil, or drink the juice three several
times. 33 Flowers stopped, drink the powder or decoction of the root. 34
Deliverance to cause, stamp the black seeds with oil, and anoint the loins
and privy parts therewith. 35 Mother suffocated, drink fifteen seeds with
wine. 36 Seethe the roots with Castory in Wine to help the Palsy and the
Stone. 37 Cast the powder of it on Cotton, and put it into the fundament, and
also drink thereof with wine against costiuenesse. 38 Falling sickness, eat
it or drink it with wine, and hang the root about the neck fifteen days.
39 Milt griefs, seethe it in wine and drink it. 40 Drink the powder with
water, honey, and powder of Coriander, to help the griefs of the stomach,
milt, and gravel in the reins. 41 Let women seethe it in white wine, and
drink it against many diseases, to help the stone, the pain of the matrix.
42 Seconds, drink powder of fifteen of the black seeds at once. 43 To cause
a woman to have throws in labor, let her take four or six of the seeds of
Peony. 44 The root gathered on the Sunday in the hour of in, the moon
increasing, and borne on them that have the falling sickness, cures them, or
hang the root of male Peony about a boys neck for the same purpose: or use
the first seeds that are round and black, especially taken with Oximell, or
with syrup of Stecados, and a little Nutmeg. 45 Nose bleeding, put the root
under thy tongue. (See Orobus, Nigella.) 46 For griefs, swelling, and
windiness of the matrix, drink one dram of the powder of the roots in
broth, especially of the flowers of Camomile. 47 For the falling evil, fear
mad, and witless, drink Peony with Wine, Ale, or water: Or use powder of it
with all thy drinks and brothes.

Quince.
QVince: The Quince stops the laske or common flux, the bloody-fluxe, and
all other fluxes of blood, spitting blood, especially when it is raw: for when
it is either boiled or roasted, it stops not so much, but it is then fitter
to be eaten, and more pleasant to the taste. 2 Women with child that eat
Quinces often in meat or otherwise, shall bring forth wise children of good
understanding. 3 The Codenac, or Marmalad made with honey as it was wont to be,
with sugar as they use to make it now a days, is very good to strengthen the
stomach, and to keep the meat therein till it be perfectly digested. 4 Being
taken before meat, it stops the laske, and after meat it loses the
belly, and closes up the mouth of the stomach so fast, that no vapors can
ascend up into the brain, and cures headache, that comes of such vapors. 5
The decoction or broth of Quinces has ye like virtue, and stops the belly,
and al fluxes of blood, and the violent issues of the terms. 6 With ye same it
is good to bathe the loose fundament and falling down of ye matrix, to make
them to return into their natural places. 7 They are also good in plasters to
stop the flux and vomiting, and for all hot swellings and inflammations of the
breast and other places. 8 The down that grows upon Quinces sodden in wine
and applied, heals carbuncles. 9 The oil of Quinces staieth vomitings,
gripings in ye belly or stomach with ye casting up of blood, if ye stomach be
anointed therewith. 10 The flowers of the Quince tree do stop fluxes, spitting
blood and the flowers, and have the same virtues that Quinces themselves have.
11 If the stomach be very hot and moist, or the belly laxatiue, Quinces are
best to be eaten before meat, being roasted or eaten cold, and the tarter that
they be, ye better they are. 12 And Pomegranates be of the same virtue. 13 But
the custom of taking of Quinces in meats hurts ye sinowes, but by way of
medicin they be excellent. 14 And the cores taken out and preserved in honey or
kept in their mussilage, they may long continue to ye use of rosting or baking:
for they be perilous to the stomach being eaten raw, but preserved, they do
mightily prevail against drunkenness. 15 If he that has drunk well eat a
Quince roasted or otherwise ordered, the drink shall not annoye his brain
much. 16 Quinces well roasted or baked, are of good nourishment, and are good
for the stomach, and take away belching, vomiting, and lothing, especially
taken after meat. 17 The syrupes and Electuaries made of Quinces with spices,
are very profitable for many griefs. 18 The juice of a raw Quince is very
good for them whose wind is stopped, and cannot hold their meat. 19 Quinces
preserved whole in honey, are very good to be used of them that have the bloody
flux. 20 Raw Quinces applied in plasters are good to stop the flux and
vomiting, the heat of the stomach, and inflammation of the breast and liver.
21 The decoction of the leaves is good against the falling down of the matrix
and fundament. 22 The seed steeped in Rose Water, is good against thick and
gross humors, in burnings with fire. 23 Gawles and Medlers be of the same
virtue. 24 No man can sufficiently declare the virtues of Quinces. 25 Quinces
are good for the stomach, they make a man piss well, but when they are
roasted, they are counted to be gentler. 26 The juice of raw Quinces is good
for them that are short winded. 27 The broth of them is good to bathe the
mother in that falls down. The Quinces that are condited with honey provoke
urine. 28 They that are sodden in honey, are more pleasant for the stomach. 29
They are good raw in plasters to stop the belly, for the inflammation of the
stomach and paps, for vomiting, hardness of the milt, and swelling about the
fundament. 30 You may make wine of them, by stamping and streyning them, but it
will not last, except you put to every xv. quartes one quart of honey, for
without honey it will turn to vergis. 31 The wine so made is good for all the
things aforesaid. 32 The oil of Quinces is made of the smallest, roundest, and
best smelling Quinces. 33 The flowers both green and dry, are good in
emplasters for all things that need binding, and for inflammations, and
vomiting of blood. 34 And they are also good against the flixe, and to stop the
terms. 35 Headache, eat roasted Quinces after meals when the ache comes of
vapors. 36 Vomit to stop, steep the kernels in water and drink it, or bind
the leaves unto thy wristes. They may be gathered in August, and kept all the
year. 37 Flux, seethe Quinces after they be pared and cored with Oak apples
and Cinamom, and sugar it and take thereof iii. nights. 38 To make Marmalad of
Quinces, take Quinces xvi. pound, core them, seethe them, and stamp them in a
stone mortar, then clarify ten pound of honey with the gleyre of an Eg, or
white well beaten, and sees all till it be stiff, then lay it on a marble
stone, and cut it of what fashion you will. 39 A plaster of Quinces is
restrictiue and good for the bloody flixe. 40 Tongue sharp and dry, put the
seeds of Quinces, and Psilium, or one of them into a cloth, and steep it in
water, and wash therewith. 41 Stamp Barley meal with half as much Quince
kernels with vinegar, and apply it to burnings or inflammations of the gout.
42 Mix the pap of sodden Quinces eight ounces, with powder of Sugar four
ounces, vinegar six spoonefull or more, Ginger half an ounce, white Pepper
one dram, seethe it to the height of a Conserve, and take thereof before and
after meat to comfort the stomach.

juice of the root, or use the powder of it. 4 Boil the juice with honey, and
mix it with a little vinegar, and streine it and drink it, to help the

For cold and undigested humors in the stomach, steep the rindes of the
roots in vinegar and honey mixed together, and eat daily a good quantity
thereof, and drink after it a draught of warm water, and put thy finger or a
feather dipped in sallet oil into thy throat to procure vomit at any time, but
the best time is in the morning. 10 For hardness of the liver and milt, seethe
the herb alone in oil and wine, and apply it plaster wise hot, and likewise
for the strangury to the bottom of the belly and root of the priuitie. 11
Distill water of Radish in September, and drink iii. or iiii. ounces of the
water morn and even for the stone, to provoke urine, to cleanse the reins and
bladder, and testicles, and for the Kings evil, to kill worms and help

or dried in the sun, and drink it to drive out ye stone. 17 The young stemes
and tender crops and buds, may be boiled and eaten with oil and vinegar, and
they nourish better then the roots, though their nourishment be but little. 18
The bark of the root taken before meat with Oximell stirs vomiting,
purges tough humors, and quickens the wit and understanding. 19 The
decoction or broth of Radish drunk, provoke urine, breaks the stone, and
drives it out, ripeth gross phlegm, cleanses the breast and stomach, and

Sausalone.
SAusalone: It is used of some instead of Garlike: some ignorant Apothecaries,
do use it in stead of Scordium: but not without great error. 2 It is good for
a cold stomach, and to be mixed with cold herbs, to take away their
coldness: but it is not good for them that are of a hot nature, or be

SAxifrage: The seed or root drunk in wine, or the decoction of it in wine,
provoke urine, breaks the stone in the kidneis and bladder, and is singular

Powder of the root taken with Sugar, comfort and warmeth the stomach,
helps digestion, cures the gripings and gnawings of the belly, and the
chollike, and expels windiness. 4 The same with the seeds, are very good
for any convulsion or crampe, apoplexia, cold fevers, all venomous bitings, or
any inward poison. 5 The same drunk with wine and vinegar, cures the plague:
and holden in the mouth, it preserves from the same, and purifieth the corrupt
air. 6 The same chewed, purges the brain, swageth the toothach, restores
speech, and is good against the Apoplexia: and so it does, being boiled in
vinegar alone: or with some water put thereto, and after holden in the mouth. 7
The juice of the leaves cleanses all spots and freckles, beautifieth the face,
and leaves a good color. 8 It cleanses rotten sores, being put into them:
and so do the leaves, bruised and applied. 9 The distilled water alone or with
vinegar, clears the sight, and takes away all darkness, being put into the
eyes. 10 The roots have the nature of Parsley roots. The same dried, may be
used in stead of Pepper. 11 The same used any way, in powders, potions, or
electuaries is very good for the gross and viscus humors in the stomach, and
the cold distemperance of the same, and for the passions of the chollike and
matrixe, all poison, and ache of the bowels, the stone of the kidneys, and to
drive down the urine and terms. 12 The seed also does all the aforesaid, and
so does the distilled water being drunk three or four spoones full at once.
13 And the same drunk with Castorie, is good for the Palsy and many cold
griefs. 14 The juice applied, heals the sores of the head. 15 Wash the face
with the water daily, to avoid the deformities thereof, and to make it fair
and clear. 16 The roots may be condyted in sugar, being first sodden and used
for the coldness of the stomach, the chollike and stone. 17 The roots and
seeds are better then the distilled water. 18 Make a plaster of the grease of
Hens, Geese and Hedghogs, with the seeds of Gromell and Saxifrage, and Gotes
blood, and apply it for the strangury and stone. 19 Drink four ounces of the
water, with two drams of powder of burned Turpentine, twice a week early in the
morning, to break and expel the stone in the bladder. 20 Stone, sees it in
strong wine, and drink it continually. 21 Stone in the reins and bladder,

sickness, and cannot tell what it is, let him take one dram of treacle with
wine of the decoction thereof, and cover him well, to sweat out all the venom,
fever and pestilence. 14 The root used any manner of way, is good for all
fluxes, both white and red. 15 The powder thereof drunk with red wine, cures
the bloody flux, if the party have no fever, but in a fever one dram of it,
with the distilled water twice a day drunk, does help it. Mix the powder with
the white of an egg, half a nutmeg, and as much Ote flower, and bake it in a
frying pan, and turn it now and then, and eat it, to heal all fluxes: or

one dram thereof with water of red Mints, for the same purpose. 16 The herb

gatherings of humors, wennes, knots, kernels, and takes away the pain of the
hips. 17 And with vinegar, it helps the running skab, emerods, piles, and
such like. 18 The water or juice stops the terms. 19 The powder heals
cuts and wounds. 20 One part of the root drunk in rain water, and another
part bruised with vinegar, and applied to the reins, will hold the birth, that
it can not fall before the natural time. 21 It is good to be taken with
Planten water, of them that cannot hold their water. 22 Let women sit in the
broth of it up to the navel, to stop their flowers: or kneade the powder with
Honey and spikenard, and lay it to the nethermost part of the belly. 23 Stomach

and no other drink, and apply the sodden herb every night over the eyes three
or four months. 25 Bruise the root and seethe it, and drink the broth for
the chollike and pinching grief of the belly. 26 Fever quarten, drink
Tormentill before the fit. 27 Chollike, drink two parts of Tormentill, and a
third part of Ginger with hot wine. 28 Tooth to draw out, apply a piece of
