To the Reader.
BEing some five or six years since in those parts of Flanders, which are
subject to the Spanish king, and seeing a miserable troop of my unhappy
countrymen, (some of which were gentlemen of good houses in England,) wandering
in poor habites and afflicted gestures, heavily groaning under the burden of
an extreme and calamitous necessity: on the one side, by their heedlesse
demeanure there, debarred from return into their country: and on the other,
daily ouerlooked with the proud eyes of disdainful Spaniards, and for want of
due regard in that comfortless service, perishing without either pity or
relief. Seeing, as I say, these things and entering into a consideration of
them, with an impartial judgment, knowing some of my good friends and
acquaintance in England, possessed with the like humor, as that which moved
the foresaid gentlemen, to forsake their country and to settle themselves in
the service and dominions of the king of Spain: I thought good to advertise
them of that which my poor experience had gathered touching the small regard,
distress, poverty, scorn, calamity, and affliction, befallen to such as had
already entered the course, that to their unexperienced judgment, yealded such
show of contentment: thereby, if it were possible, to dissuade them from
attempting the like, the same being in regard of the offense to their
sovereign so treacherous; of the reproach to their familye, and parentage; so
infamous, and lastly in so deep a degree to themselves dangerous, that being
once thereinto entered, it should not be in their power, upon their
afterchange of humor and appetite, thence to withdraw themselves, the error
being such as admits not any repentance or excuse. Having to that effect,
written from thence privately to some of my acquaintance, the coppies of my
letters (contrary to my intention) were since my return, by some of them
given abroad, and lastly not long since, a discourse printed in Paul's
Church-yarde, containing some part of the substance thereof, but many things
that I had written left out, and many things inserted that I never meant, and
finally in the whole so falsified and changed, as well in matter as words, and
ignorantly entermixed with fictions of the publisher, that howsoever the vulgar
sort be therewith pleased, those that are of farther reach and insight,
cannot but condemn it as a thing fabulous, grossly handled and full of
absurdities. Besides, the time and occasion to which that discourse was
fitting, is now altogether past, and therefore the same altogether impertinent.
In regard of which and other inconveniences, I thought it not unfit to
publish the true copy of my own letter, which though after so many years,
cannot but seem stale, yet the occasions that moved me thereunto considered, I
trust I shall not otherwise be censured of, then the sincerity of my meaning
deserves, which is to dedicate the fruicts of my poor experience to the
benefit of my country, and withal to satisfy the world, as touching the
former treatise (for though they are suppressed, yet there are great numbers
of them extant) the which was by a fellow, that had stolen a copy thereof,
foysted to the print, in hope of benefit, and now when the matter comes to
examination, slipps his head out of the Collar and will not be found. Withal,
I shall perchance, seeing I have so good an occasion offered, touch by the way
some occurrents of later time. And whereas my meaning was at the first, only
to satisfy a few private friends, now seeing it is my chance to publish it,
I shall entreat the Reader whosoever he be, and howsoever in religion
affected, nevertheless laying aside all preiudicate opinion, not to condemn
any thing (seem the same never so strange) herein mentioned, unless he
shall himself be able to disprooue it, which I hope, for trewnesse of matter
it shall not lie in any man's power to do. For my meaning is not to speak of
sophistical devices, proiected driftes, or matters forged in the air, but
plainly and simply, of things actually and really done in public view of
the world, and confirmed with the witness of thousands.

THE COPPIE OF A Letter, written by a Gentleman that had sometimes served the
King of Spain: To a Catholic Gentleman his Kinseman and Friend.
SIR, understanding as well by your Letters, as also by the message lately done
unto me by the mouth of R. B. of the great longing and desire you have to
come into these parts, and to employ your self here in service of the
Spanish King: And perceiving also not only by your said Letters, but by the
Gentleman that brought the same, and by the report of sundry others, that many
young Gentlemen of our Country are of your mind in that point: Some thereunto
(as I guess) moved of a youthful and vain tickling humor, to be wandering
abroad in strange and foreign Countries: others in hope there to grow to great
preferment, adua^ncement, employment, and wealth: other some pretending matter
of conscience, seem to have sure confidence that there they may live with more
liberty and ease of mind, than that which within our Country they enjoy: I
have thought good for the particular love which I bear, and always have born
toward you, unto whom I wish as to my self (but chiefly in respect of that due
humble regard, and zealous reverent affection which I bear to the service and
sacred person of our most gracious and princely Sovereign, the Queens most
excellent Majesty, and to my most dearly loved native Country and countrymen)
to set down some notes and observations, which by a long and dangerous
experience in this place I have heedfully gathered, By which (I hope) I shall
make manifest, as well to you, as likewise to all other my Countrymen
(howsoever in humor disposed) by apparent examples, and undeniable truths, how
greatly you and they (that desire to repair hither, by any of the motions
before expressed, are in any hope of good to be received from the said King
of Spain or his ministers,) do err and are deceived. I heartely and most
earnestly desire you and all other that shall read this Treatise, deeply to
judge and consider of these points, which I shall herein set down, which
(God willing) I will do with such fidelity, true meaning, and sincerity, as
that no part of the same shall be truly to be gainsaid or refelled, and my
self by the persons, times, and places, and other circumstances, shall make
most manifest and plain, to any that shall doubt of the truth of the same, or
any part thereof. And I shall take great joy and comfort, if my self having
undertaken an untowardly and dangerous course, though with better success than
has happened to many hundreds, may be as a caveat to all the young Gentlemen
of our nation, how they hazard themselves so daungerously: and that my painful
experirience may be to them as a Looking glass, wherein they may behold the
spots and errors of their conceived fancies, or as a mark set up for them,
whereby they may avoid the perils and most dangerous rocks and shelfes, to
them yet unknown, and lying hidden under the smooth, fair, and delightful
conceived, and fantasied pleasures suggested unto them by their own
imagination, the same being unexperienced, and therefore without mistrust. And
surely I cannot too much commend the saying of that excellent Roman Orator,
who placed in the first degree of wisdom, those that were of themselves best
able to give good advise, and in the next, those that were willing, and
inclinable to follow it.

But some man may here perchance ask me, whence I have such an assurance of my
wit, that I will take upon me to advise others, who are perchance better able
to counsel me? To this I answer, that if any man how mean so ever, will for
my profit and good go about to instruct me in any thing, wherein himself
has made so long experience, and will confirm the same with so many
substantial proofs and examples as I will do this, he shall find me easy
to be persuaded, without straining himself to the search of any high points
of wit, or subtlety of well colored speech, for so manifest a truth needs no
disguising, but rather is by a plain and simple nakedness the more commended.
But as for those that with fore-possessed minds, regard not what danger so
ever they throw themselves into, Circe was a great Sorceresse, who
transformed such into beasts and monsters as hearkened to her allurements
greedily with a newfangled appetite swallowing down any licour that
presents it self unto them in a glistering cup, I think neither wit nor
truth will be of much avail, though those that are of greater discretion and
more temperatly disposed, will (I doubt not) read it with indifferent eyes,
and conceive of it as it deserves. For if they were to sail along the
perilous rocks of Circe or the Syrenes, I think they would not refuse to
hear Ulysses speak, The Sirenes ^vere the three ^aughters of A^helous and
Calli^pe between Italy and Sicily, who with their delicious music and
singing, drew the passingers to ^iste^ unto them: and procured their
destruction. The Poets feine them to be tra^sformed into Sea monsters, and to
retain the said practice still.
but gladly give attention to his counsels, seeing among many that perished, it
was his only hap to hear the alluring songs of the one, and to see the
enchanting cruelties of the other, and yet to escape the danger of them both.

I will entertain you no longer with circumstance, but for the confirmation of
my speech, refer you to the following Discourse.

THE BEGINNING of the Discourse.
BEing forced by the fore remembered occasions, to make of a private Letter a
publik discourse: I am at the very first troubled, not knowing what method to
observe in a matter so abrupt and full of confusion; which I fear me, is
likely to prove to the true English and well minded reader as delightlesse, as
it is to me that write it altogether comfortles, in regard of the numbers of
our nation whereof I must entreat, and among the rest, of some of good
parentage, that have with full draught swallowed into their intrailes the
loathsome dregs of this Spanish infection: being to our nation a thing as
fatal and deadly, as ever was the gold of Toulouse, or the horse of Seian to
the unfortunate possessors thereof. Whose course and actions (though the law of
God, the law of nations, the duty to our Sovereign, and the love to our
country, binds us to detest and hate, because they follow an opposite armed
enemy that seeks our subversion: yet in regard they are of the same nation
and language which we are of, charity and kindness wishes us to take
compassion of their abused conceits, and to wish them yet now at length to open
their eyes, and to behold the dangerous estate wherein they have plunged
themselves, the infamy and scorn wherein they live, yea, under those whom
they serve as hirelings: and lastly, the reprochful blot that they have given
to the noblenes of our heretofore unblemished nation, which in former ages,
howsoever laboring in intestine broiles, yet never was detected of such base
and wicked trecheries, as to sell themselves to a foreign prince, to be by him
employed to the overthrow of their country, and the taking away of their
Sovereigns life.

This is the unpleasing subject I must entreat of, drawing forcibly unto it the
recital of so many conspiracies, murders, violences, practices, and treasons,
that for the strangeness thereof, it will rather bear the resemblance of a
tragical fiction, the^ of a true discourse.

The method of this ensuing Discourse.
I will first direct my speeches to such unexperienced gentlemen, as are in
desire addicted to the Spanish service, showing them in what point of their
hope and expectation they do fail and are deceived, laying unto them before
their eyes, the fall, misery, and calamity of as many as have before them
entered within the compass of this enchanted circle.

Secondly, to our credulous Catholics at home, upon whose ignorance and
driftles search into these matters, our practicing traitors abroad do bulid
their chefest foundations of al their vilanies (whom while they entertain with
vain expectations, in the mean time, with traitors and spies which they daily
send over) they abuse with ouer-reaching subtilties, to the irreparable ruin
and overthrow of them and theirs.

They have also at their devotion certain ambodexter fellows, who upon fained
colors and pretenses pass to and fro, feeding either side with news, who in
regard of some few bad inteligences, which now and then they bring into
England, would feign be accounted honest serviceable men: but they must pardon
me a little, in respect of some experience that I have had of them, if I
conceive otherwise, thinking them to be in deed far more dangerous than
either the secret spy, or the discovered traitor, and in place where when I
shall be asked, I will yield my reason. For since I was a scholar, I remember
a verse in Seneca, Seneca in Octaua Tragedia Agamemnon.
Pretio parata vincitur pretio sides: I speak this, because the Prince whom
they serve, howsoever otherwise, with these fellows will not stick to deal
most liberally.

Thirdly, because many of our countrymen living in great happiness at home, yet
(like those that cannot take good rest when they lie soft) do in their conceit
mislike (surfeiting with to much ease) the quiet estate they live in, and the
manner of her Majesty's most gracious and merciful government, I have thought
it my duty somewhat to express these few things which have come to my
knowledge touching the benefits and blessings which it has pleased God so
plentifully to pour down upon her majesty and her people: together with the
flourishing estate of that fortunate realm, since this the time of her
Majesty's government, so plentiful in peace, so victorious in wars, so
industrious in arts, and so excelling in all sciences, that the very Spanish
enemy himself will not stick many times to break out into admiration
thereat, The Spanish enemy himself admireth the blessed estate and happy
government of England.
and sometimes in his scoffing or rather blasphemous humor swear that he
thinks Jesus Christ is become a protestant: withal, I will briefly make a
short comparison between this and the government of the adversary, I mean
the king of Spain, his cruel and inhumane usage of his miserable subjects,
his violent abolition and taking away of their privileges, and in fine, the
unspeakable bondage, constrained servitude, and pitiful desolatio^ in which
they live, or rather despairfully do languish: a matter though far unfit for
me to handle, but worthy of grauer wits, and men of the highest wisdom and
experience, yet considering I shall not presume to treat of matters of great
estate and secrets, but such as every well affected subject may find and
pick out of the heroical actions of the one, and the tyrannical insolences
of the other, both done in the appearance of the world, I hope, and so with all
lowlynes most humbly desire her most gracious and benign majesty to pardon
me, if undertaking such a task, I chance to come far short of that, which men
fitter for the handling thereof could say or entreat, and so likewise most
earnestly beseech that I may therein be censured according to the loyal zeal I
bear to her Majesty's service and my country, and not to the baseness and
simplicity of my style, or the handling thereof.

But to come to my discourse, to the end that you and the rest of your opinion,
may clearly and plainly discern those things, which hitherto your eyes
blinded with the veil of partiality, or perchance misled with a contrariety
of affection, have not bin able to view: I will begin with the good usage,
honor, and advancement that you and other Gentlemen addicted to the Spanish
service are to expect, bringing you for example sundry brave and worthy
Gentlemen, Captains, and soldiers, that have taken the like cause before you;
whereby you shall perceive that all is not gold that glistereth fair, but
that whatsoever show the Spaniard make unto us, yet in his heart he mortally
abhors us, and by all means possible seeks our destruction, ruin, and
subversion, as it evidently appears by his usage of such troops and companies
of our nations as have served him.

I will not speak of the cruelty of the Commendador upon certain English
Gentlemen that had done notable services both to him and the Duke of Alua,
Eight Englishmen hanged up in Antwarp by commandment of Don Luis Requesence,
the Co^mendador and Captain general of the low Countries for the king.
of whom nevertheless for a mere trifling occasion, he caused eight to be
hanged up after the sack of Antwarpe on the Mere brigge.

Neither will I trouble you with the tragical discourse of M. Aegrimont
Ratcliffe, and M. Gray, who were as the world knows, both gentlemen of noble
houses, and most faithfully affected both in religion and service to the
Spanish king; nevertheless, upon I know not what suspicion, that they should
have practiced the death of Don Joan, they were both apprehended, and though
there never was, M. Aegrimon^ Ratcliffe and M Gray wrongfully put to death by
the Spaniard.
nor ever could be any thing proved against them, and they at their deaths
protested themselves to be most innocent of that wherewith they were charged,
yet their heads were stricken off in the market place of Namures. I touch these
things the more sparingly, because they happened before my time of being there,
and in matters delivered by heresaie I might err, which (undertaking to write
no thing but that which is true and vnrefutable) I would be loath to do, and
therefore I will come to things of later time, and such as I do certainly know.

At the siege of Audenarde, where the D. of Parma lay encamped, there came
rendering themselves unto his service, under the conduct of Norris, Barney,
Cornish, and Gibson, Six hundred Englishmen came and rendered themselves to the
Duke of Parmas service, who then lay at the siege of Audenarde.
whom they had chosen to be their Captains, a troop of six hundred, the
tallest and best appointed soldiers that I remember ever to have seen in all
my life, their coming being the only cause, that the Town (a matter of
great importance, and on the land side, as it were the very key of the
province of Flanders) was so soon delivered unto him as it was. The manner of
their coming and their usage.
For whereas the Duke of Aniou and the Prince of Orange lay under the walls
of Gaunt, with sufficient force and most deliberate resolution to succor the
said town of Audenarde, upon this mutiny of the English, they marched away
with their whole army, leaving the enemy now battering the town: which,
seeing it self frustrated of the expected succors, presently rendered it self
unto the Duke of Parma. Thence they were drawn to Wynoch bergen to serve
against the French and English that lay there encamped, where they behaved
themselves with such desperate resolution, that day that Monsieur de Balanson,
brother to the Marquess of Warambon was taken prisoner, that besides the loss
of many of their lives, they were a wonder to the whole army, which praise of
theirs the pride of the Spaniards not enduring, The envy of the Spaniard.
did vpbraide them that they had served rather like giddie headed dronkards,
than men wisely valiant. Sir Roger Williams well remembers this days work,
for he was there in service of the states, and unless I am deceived, lost a
brother in that service. Shortly after, upon the remove of the Duke of
Alansons army toward Gaunt, they were likewise brought thither, where also
they gave exceeding testimony of their valor and courage, namely, the very
day that sir John Norris made that famous and memorable retreat before Gaunt,
The famous ^etreate made before Gaunt by sir John Norris.
who when the French men fled with a disordered amazement, did with a present
courage and excellent direction maintain the place with such regiments of
English as were under his charge; and withstanding the Duke of Parma in the
teeth with all his puissance, who furiously charged him, nevertheless withdrew
his men still holding their pikes in the bosoms of the enemy, safely under the
walls of Gaunt, not without exceeding damage to the enemy: insomuch that the
Duke of Parma would ever after say, that he only had that day barred him
from crying quittance with the Duke of Alanson, for the retreat which he had
caused him to make from Cambray; which still did stick in his stomach even to
his dying day.

But now to my newcome English that had done these notable services to the
Spaniard, let us see how they were recompensed: within one year they were
suffered all in a manner to famish, which misery some of them seeking to
relieve by foraging out upon the country, Eoure and twenty Englishmen hanged
by the Spaniard in Audenarde,
four and twenty of them were taken by the Spanish provost, and carried to
Audenarde (of the rendering whereof they had bin the chiefest means) and
openly hanged in the market place. Another troup of them, being thirty in
number, and lying in a village near Poppering in Flanders, a company of
Spaniards hearing of them, came into the village where they were, and after a
friendly and souldierly salutation of each side, as they were all making merry
together, on a sudden the Spaniards took the^ at advantage unarmed, A most
monstrous murder committed by the Spaniard up on sundry English soldiers yt
served among them.
and most trecherously and inhumanely murdered them every one, rifling them of
their clothes, and such other things as they had pilled abroad in the country.
Sundry co^plaintes were made to the Duke by the friends of those that were
thus murdered, and by the Captains of the regiment, Amongst ye rest that were
thus murdered, there was one Aucrie Crispe, brother in law to sir Stephen
Thornax, likewise a younger son of Alderman Starkie: one Norton, etc.
but Spaniards being the doers thereof, there could neither be remedy nor
justice obtained. But to make amends, because they would be the cleanlyer rid
of the residue of this poor miserable troop the camp being then before
Wynochbergen, wherein lay a mighty strong garrison of Frenchmen, they made
them two little fortes of purpose, in which they willingly placed them in the
utmost quarter of the whole camp, and nearest confining to the town, to the
end they might have all their throats cut, as in deed they had very few
nights after, at which time the enemy assaulting them with great fury, and
they defending themselves most manfully above the space of an hour, in such
sort as the allarum passed through the whole camp, yet they were never relieved
with any succor at all, These English troops overthrown by treachery of the
Sqaniard
insomuch as the greatest part of them being slain in the defense, the enemy
at last entered, and put the residue to the sword.

To rehearse unto you the sundry and several calamities that these poor men
as well captains as soldiers endured, during the time of that their
unfortunate service, especially at Gausbecke, Ask, and Gauer, would seem (I
am sure) unto you for the unspeakable strangenes thereof, scarcely credible,
for they never received in all the time of their service, any one months
pay, I have seen Lieutenants and Ensigns of them go up and down sickly and
famished, begging their bread, covered only with poor blankets and tikes of
featherbeds, that they had rifled in the villages abroad, and have my self
relieved some of them: Neither were the ends of their Captains less
tragical, which I thought good to set down, to the end you may perceive,
that such and so great calamities as these, could never have happened without
the apparent hand of God, whose reuengful justice never ceased to pursue the
infidelity of these miserable men, til he had taken them from the face of the
earth.

First Norris, chief captain and ringleader of the rest, The strange and
tragical ends of the leaders and captains of this revolted regiment.
after he had leisure to bethink himself of the foulenes of his fault, and
withal saw the scorn and contempt wherein he lived under the Sraniard,
conceived thereof so deep an impression, that he fell dangerously sick, and
into a kind of lunasie, of which before he was well recovered, he stole
secretly out of the camp lying then at Varnaton, with intention to convey
himself into England, but by the way was taken prisoner and carried to
Flushing, Norris died mirably at Flushing.
whereby dying in prison, or as some say, by laying violent hands on him
self, he prevented those torments, that according to the quality of his
offense, were prepared for him. Gibson at such time as the camp lay before
Mening, lying one night with his wife in his cabine, a Spanish horseman coming
upon occasion into his quarter, chanced to tie his horse to the stake whereunto
Gibsons cabin was fastened, who what with stamping and shaking the cabin, did
so disquiet him, that he arose thinking to untie the horse, giving withal some
hard words to the owner, who in requital thereof ran him through the body
with this rapier, Gibson slain suddenly by night.
so that he fell down in the place stark dead. I saw his wife many times
afterward weeping and falling down upon her knees before the Duke of Parma
for justice. But English blood was there of so vile price, especially being
shed by a Spaniard, that the matter was not thought worthy the inquiring after.

Cornish was in the one of the little forts before mentioned, at such time as
they were surprised by the French men, within the which both himself, his
lieutenant, Ensign, and whole company were miserably slain and mangled.
Barnies Company was with the other likewise defeated, and put to the sword,
but he himself was by his good hap sick and absent at Saint Homars. Cornish
and his whole company slain in a forte before Winocbergen
Nevertheless he escaped not altogether his part and portion of these
afflictions, for presently upon his return to the camp, as he stood
beholding the march of a company of footmen that passed by, he was shot at,
by an unknown man with an harguebuze, which by chance though it missed his
body, yet it lighted upon his right arm, in such sort, as it sheuered all
the principal bones thereof to pieces, so that he has utterly lost the use
thereof. Shortly after he was taken prisoner by the English souldyers of
Ostend, where he was every day in danger of the gallows, but upon
promises of great services he was at length set at liberty by Sir John
Conway, and suffered to return from whence he came, whereas yet he lives
but maimed and very muserable, and in exceeding great distress, needinesse,
and poverty.

Two or three years after this foreremembred story, came one William Pigot, A
lost betrayed to the King of Spain by a regiment of Englismen, of which one
Pygot had the comanding.
who being of a mean man raised to the degree of a Captain by Sir John
Norris, and in his absence left as commander in Alost, over the rest of the
Companies, trecherously deceiving him to whom he was so infinitely beholding,
rendered the Town, himself, and the whole Regiment, (being well near a
thousand as tall and well appointed men as were in Europe) to the service and
devotion of the Spanish King, which service, how meritorious and beneficial
it was unto the Spaniard, I leave to their judgments that know the Country.
For by this rendition of the town of Alost, they were the occasion that he
got Dermounde, the Sasse, the fortes of Leifkins hook, Saint Anthonies, and
Saint Margarets the dole, the best part of the land of Wast, and in manner
Gaunt it self, as the sequel very apparently showed: notwithstanding all
which service, they were within two years space, what with hunger, the
gallows, and rigorous dealing, quite consumed and brought to nothing. And
lastly at Stalbrooke, even against the yielding up of Anwarpe, when all other
Nations whatsoever, were to receive their count and reckoning, they only were
infamouslye cashierde without any one months pay, receiving only every
one a Ducket.

And which of all others is most monstrous and scarcely credible, whereas some
of the Captains not long before, had made them of their own purses new and
fair Ensigns, those Ensigns were by a Spanish Commissarie called Spinosa
(who came with order to dissolve the regiment) taken violently from those that
bare them, An exceeding disgrace used to the English by the Spaniard.
in presence of the Earl of Westmerland, who was Coronell of the regiment, and
for a greater disgrace both to him and the rest, though both he, Captain
Tresham, and the other Captains complained to the Duke for redres, Captain
Tresha^ a little before the breaking of the regiment when Tailor was slain had
his company given him.
which they could not obtain: the Spaniard afterward made his brags, that he
turned the English Ensigns into Spanish fieldbeds.

Somewhat before this time, when the whole camp received at the siege of
Dermounde two months pay, they only though of all others most traveled in
the trenches, wading every night from their quarter to the place where they
kept their guard, which was upon a dike or caussey, through waters up to the
bosom, and having had more men slain in that siege, than any other regiment
in the whole camp, could not receive one penie, notwithstanding that they had
passed musters with the rest, yea, and some of the Captains had bribed the
Commissaries to pass them many places, thinking thereby to make a great hand:
but in sted of money when they made suit to the Duke, There are in the kings
army two Contadors, whose office is to keep ye Rols and books of the army,
to make the Patents of captains and coronels, and to put their hands to al such
assignations of money as are granted, and many other ye like things, so that
their office is of great re^l^ning and dignity.
were scornfully by him poasted off to the Contadores of the army, of whom
they receued the most base and opprobrious speeches that were ever given unto
soldiers, and that can Lieutenant Butlar well testify: for he being then
Lieutenant unto Pigot, was one of the number unto whom they were used: he is
now in her Majesty's service, and was lately Lieutenant of sir John Poolies
horsemen, and as I hear, has done her Majesty many good services. The
conclusion is, they were absolutely rejected, without ever receiving one
halfepenie. And lastly, upon casting of the regiment, whereas the pay of a
reformed Captain, (for so they call them whose companies are cashierd or taken
away) of what nation so ever he be amongst them, is forty crowns a month,
they gave only to our English Captains but five and twenty, neither that but
in paper only, for I think some of them never received any penny at all in
money, and if they did, I am sure it was very little.

Thus much as touching the usage which they received from the Spaniard, but now
keeping the course I began, I will acquaint you with the punishment which it
pleased God to lay upon the leaders and first seducers of this miserable
forenamed troop.

Upon their arrival in the Spanish camp, they were divided into seven
companies, The names of ye Captains and commanders of this Regiment, and their
miserable endo^.
the one of which was given to the Earl of Westmerland, who upon their humble
request and suit, was made Coronell and commander of them all, and one
Contraras, a Spaniard, joined with him as his assistant, or rather as a master
and commander both over him and the regiment: another was given to Pigot, with
the title of Lieutenant Coronell: the third to Dalton, with the office of
Sergeant mayor: the names of the other four upon whom the residue of the
companies were bestowed, were Tailor, Vincent, Smith, and Walsh. I will begin
with Pigot, The strange calamity and death of Pigot.
because he only was the first and chief actor and instrument in this
treachery, abusing with the subtlety of his fair speech the rest of his
countrymen, that were by him drawn into this action. Pigot after he had
stayed a while in the camp, as he was wily and full of craft, The strange
calamity and death of Pygot.
so he quicklye perceived how the world was likely to go with him and his
fellows, and therefore leaving the rest to wear themselves out in poverty
and travel, he while he had money in his purse got him into Spain, thinking
surely with himself, that in regard his service had been so important, he
should there have been received with cross and candle, and besides be
mightily recompensed. He would not admit any other of the Captains for
companion in the journey, fearing least partnership might have made the merit
of his service, (which to himself he attributed alone) seem the less,
Pygots cold entertainment in Spain.
and so consequently his reward.

With this crafty intention he arrived at Madrile, where after he had a
while wandered up and down unregarded, at length by means of sir Frances
Englefield, to whom he was in that behalf an earnest suter, he was brought by
an interpreter, (for he had no other language but plain English) to the speech
of Don Joan de Ydeaques, being then the kings Secretorie, from whom (after he
had declared his service and cause of coming) he received this answer, that
the King had appointed the Duke of Parma to be his lieutenant, The answer of
Don Iuan De Ydeaques the Kings secretary.
and Captain general in the low Conntries, to whose direction and discretion
he referred the consideration of all such like services as should there fall
out, wishing him therefore with all speed to return unto the Duke, who, no
doubt, would take notice of his services: offering him his Letter unto the
Duke in that behalf.

This answer was cold and contrary to Pigots expectations, but back he
must, there was no remedy: No replye of his could alter the Secretories
resolution: Somewhat before his undertaking this journey, he had married a
handsome young woeman of those Countries, whom he left at Tourney in a
Citizens house, and with her in charge, all whatsoever he was worth. She in
the time of his absence, being very fearful to lie alone, had entertained
into her bed a young man of the Town of her old acquaintance, with whom
(hearing of her husbands return) she ran away, selling first whatsoever of
her husbands that was not portable, and the rest of the things that remained,
being of any value, she took with her. And with this Companion of hers she
got her self into England, knowing that her husband durst not make pursuit
thither after her: but coming to London she met with certain Flaunders
Souldyours that knew her and her husband, who under color of yielding her
assistance in a strange place, coosened her of the greatest part of such
things as she had left (being of good worth) as she had so deceived her
husband of: the rest she spent in dissoluteness, and so by degrees, according
to the fortune of such courses, fell into extremest misery and beggerie that
might be, in the mean time Pygots heart being stricken dead, with the
coldness of the entertainment he had in Spain, and now returning homewardes
on the one side, quite frustrated of all his expectations and hopes, and on the
other side pursued with the stynges and terrors of a guilty conscience, yet
cheered up him self with thinking on the comfort of his wives youth and
affections, Aloft sold by Pigot to ye king of Spanie for 30 thousand French
crowns.
and withal of the money that he had left in her keeping: for you must
consider that he had not given, but sold the town of Alost for thirty
thousand French crowns, for payment of which they had hostages, and the same
was fully paid before he delivered up the town. Out of this money six
months pay was deducted for the soldiers, the rest he divided among the
Captains, retaining a great share to himself, which, as you hear, he had
left in keeping with his wife, as a certain remedy in store against whatsoever
hardness of fortune should afterward happen. But being upon his return to
Torney incountered with the news of his wives disloialtie, and withal, which
grieved him most, finding his lodgings ransackt, his coffers empty, and
himself at once overwhelmed with such a heap of scorn and misery; I leave
you to imagine the patience and quietness wherewith his mind entertained
these tidings, being (as before I told you) one that merely for money (as for
religion he knew not what it meant) had sold his loialty to his prince and
country, his faith to his Coronell, (to whom in so many duties he was tied,)
and finally his own person, as likewise he would have done his soul if he
could have found a chapman. Sure I am that if by the bodies iestures a man may
judge of the minds unquiet perturbations, there was never any wretch more
violently overthrown with the extremity of an inward affliction and despair,
yet did he not for all this wholly forsake and abandon himself, but rather
determined to turn, as the proverb is, every stone, and to attempt fortune
once anew, thereby either to redress the miseries of his estate, or at the
least, if the worst should fall, to end his life, for finding himself already
about the shoes, he made no reckning of being above the boots, and therefore
following the saying of the Poet, Per scelera sceleribus tutum esse itur, he
resolved himself by a new treachery to amend his old, and withal his fortune
if it were possible, and therefore fell presently a tempering with some of his
friends in Holland and Zeland, and lastly with my Lord of Leicester himself,
being then newly come over to the government of the united provinces, to whom
he offered, so he might have his pardon, and withal be rewarded, to betraie
the Duke of Parma in some notable sort, besides sundry other little services
(of which none could be performed without notable perjury and infidelity) to
perform which he made prodigal offers of his best endeavors, which
neuerthlesse truly I think he had not been able to perform, though he had
never been hindered in the course of his practices, yet from time to time he
sent my Lord over such poor intelligences, as the smalnes of his credit
wherein he lived could attain unto. The carrier of his letters and the
returner of his aunsweres, was a brokerly fellow, an Englishman, that then dwelt
in the English house at Antwarpe, called I. G. one that in intelligence,
desired to correspond with either side, but with whether he dealt faithfully
God knows, I will speak the less of him, because though his wife remain
still in Antwarpe, yet he himself is withdrawn to Middleborough, where some
say he lives now honestly and well. This fellow whether by careless
conueiance, or by worse practice, as some suspected (though truly I think him
thereof innocent, as Rowland York afterward assured me) with whom Pigot had
at that time intelligence, who had used him before in such like practices for
himself, and by him received his pardon and pasport, upon his first being
with the Duke of Parma, from my L. of Leycester, yet in conclusion he handled
his matters so ill, that Mondragon, chief Captain and Lieutenant of the
Castles of Anwarpe and Gaunt, came to have intelligence thereof, who presently
thereupon caused Pigot to be apprehended and conveyed prisoner to the Castle of
Gaunt, Pigot sent prisoner to the castle of Gaunt.
where he had been presently laid upon the torture, but that Hugh Owen, who
for some causes especially affected him, labored to the contrary. And in fine
so much prevailed, that after half a years imprisonment, he got him to be
delivered: Thence poor and penilesse he traueled to Burges, where the Duke of
Parma then remained, with intention to sue for somewhat wherewith to relieve
himself. Nemesis in Tergo.
But whether soever he went, still Nemesis followed him in tergo: Justice still
followed him at his heels.
for by the way he was taken by certain English soldiers that lay in ambush
on the way, and by them carried prisoner to Ostend, where with the smothnesse of
his tongue, and the protestation of many great services by him intended, he so
enchaunted Sir John Conway then being governor of the town, Pigot taken and
carried prisoner to Ostend.
that he forbear to hang him, as he was once determined: and presently by
letters advertised the Counsel of his taking, and withal such services, of
which he to shift the halter from his neck, had given such confidence and
assurance, so he might be suffered to escape: al which notwithstanding, by the
Counsels commandment, he was sent for into England, and committed prisoner to
the Marshalsie: Pigot died suddenly and stra^gely in ye marshalsie.
where having remained some space of time, being one day well ouernight, he fell
into strange and extreme accidents of his body, and was found the next
morning dead. Such after this goodly service was his fortune, and such his end,
and such be the like of all other treacherous ill affected Englishmen. But now
let us come to speak of master Dalton, being next in the row, and see how
he spedde.

This Gentleman, to the end you should the better know him, was one of the
craftiest Conicatchers that ever lived, and had all his life time shifted it
out with coosening sleightes and practices of vilanie, as all the old
Flaunders soldiers that knew him, can well testify: now by reason of his
good experience he was grown very weather wise, and did by many conjectures
foresee the storms and tempests that were coming toward him and his
followers, and therefore thinking it a great madness to lie still at Anchor in
so dangerous and unsafe a road, hoysed up his sails and showed them a fair
pair of heels, running away from them at Torney, where the Duke of Parma
then kept his Court, into France, yet because he would not be in his
absence unremembered, he first took up upon his credit as much wares, as by
all his utmost devises he could procure, either of Mercers, Goldsmithes, or
any other sort of Artificers. Thence he conveyed himself into the North
parts of England: where, as he had gotten his goods wickedly, so he spent
them as riotously: afterward changing his name, he betook him to sea, Dalton
hanged in the North Country.
and became a pirate, for which, and sundry other such honest parts as he had
played, he was of afterward apprehended, and tied up to the galowes there in
the North, in the year 1586.

Tailor of all the rest was most to be pitied, for he was a man of very
comely personage, fine qualities, and very gentlemanly behauior. His father
had long served her Majesty, as likewise himself had done in some office, as I
take it, pertaining to the provisions of her stable, it was my chance to
converse much with him, both because we were of acquaintance in England, as
also that I liked exceedingly his conversation, and the manner of his carriage,
and truly thus much I must say of him being now dead, that I did never know
any man that was stricken with a greater apprehension of his own fault, and
that did more every way beat his brains and seek all occasions how to amend
it. The cause that had drawn him into this matter, as sundry times he told me,
and sometimes not without tears, were the many debts, with which (being very
youthfully given) he had entangled himself in England, and withal his
marriage, which was most unfortunate. To rid himself of both which
inconveniences at once, he had throwe^ himself into this headlong action: which
surely if God had lent him life, Coronell Morgan sent a Letter to Captain
Tailor in ye hair of an Irish lacky
he would have endeavored to amend. For I remember once, the camp lying then at
a place called Euergham, that coronel Morgan sent him a secret Letter, wrapped
in the long hair of an Irish lacky that brought it, who not handling his
matters with that warines as was requisite, the Letter was discovered, and
Captain Tailor apprehended: nevertheless by the help of his own wit, and the
assistance of his friends, he was soon set at liberty again, though with an
exceeding suspicion, that ever after ouerlooked his doings, insomuch, that in
great grief of mind he complained unto me, that the only iealousy held of him
in regard of this Letter, would be a great hinderance to that satisfaction
which he had in his mind resolved, which was at least to have drawn back
away with him all such English soldiers as served the king in that regiment,
which in regard of their love unto him, he might easily have done. But it
pleased the almighty in his judgments to prevent him, and to take him away
in the midst of his imaginations, for he and my L. of Westmerland having bin
one day in the quarter of the Wallons, The Earl of Westmerlande and Captain
Tailor entered into quarrel.
banqueted by a captain of the Count of Egmonts, where according to the use of
that nation, either of them had bin constrained to drink liberally: as they
returned back together, they two in company alone toward Euergham, they fell
in to contention about a frivolous matter, concerning one Dauies an Irishman,
that served the Earl, and that so far, that the Earl reuiling him in many
opprobrious names, lighted down his horse, and drew his sword, willing him to
do the like, but Tailor knowing how extremely there the law determines of him
that should draw his sword against his Coronell, put spurs to his horse, and
galloped home before to his lodging: which scorn of his, as the Earl did
interpret it, moved him to so great cholar, that getting up on his horse he
pursued him, and drew upon him again before the very door of his loding,
which indignity Tailor not being able any further to endure, drawing his rapier
likewise encountered him, and after some thrusts between them, Tailor hurtes
the Earl.
ran the Earl very daungerously into the breast, at which instant Contraras
the Spaniard, accompanied with many soldiers of the Earls company, the most
part of the which had halbertes, came running in, Tailor slain by the Earl
of Westmerland, and Contraras a Spaniard.
and inuironing Tailor of all sides, most cruelly murdered him with above
twenty wounds, for which cause the Earl was, upon the complaints and
earnest pursuit of the other Captains and soldiers, by the Duke of Parma for
a time bannished the Regiment, and the government thereof given to one Mana
Cardonni, an Italian.

Shortly after another of these Captains called Edward Vincent, was sent out of
the land of Waft, where the Spanish army lay then encamped, with two hundred
English soldiers, in company of an Italian captain with as many more
Italians, toward the forte of Terneuse, where by a sallie made from out the
forte, they were all overthrown, Captain Vincent taken prisoner.
sundry slain, and among the rest Captain Vincent taken prisoner, where
nevertheless, in regard of former acquaintance with Coronell Michael, who was
there commander for the States, he found such favor at his hands, that he
was not presently delivered over to the States, (as he mortally feared) but
set at ransom at an hundred and fifty pounds, provided that the same
should be sent with speed, for otherwise when the matter should be once
known to the States in Holland, it could not be in his power possible any
longer to vvithholde him, of which desperate estate, Vincent did with all speed
advertise his father, being then a poor old man, well near seventy years
of age, who having by present sale of such things as his son had left with
him, raisde some part of the money, fell down upon his knees before the
Duke, weeping and imploring his help for the rest, telling him in the Spanish
tongue (in the which language he was very perfect) the great danger and
extremity of the case his son then stood in, if so be his ransom were
not presently sent. But in stead of yielding him relief, the Duke badde, take
away the importunate dotard: but when nevertheless he persisted (overcome
with a Fathers affection) to use many loud and passionate speeches, the
Spaniardes by violence thrust him away, calling him fool and dronkarde. The
grief whereof struck the old man so inwardly to the heart, that he went
home to his lodging, and died within six days after. And his son when his
ransom came not in time, Vincents father dyed of sorrow, and himself hanged in
chains at Bargenopsome.
was by the States commandment sent to Bargenopsome, and there hanged in
chains, where his cracasse remains yet wauing in the vvinde.

Smith held yet somewhat longer out, though drinking as deeply in the cup of
misery, or rather deeplier than any of the rest, for he fell thorough
sickness and poverty into such extremity of wants, that of a Captain he
was feign to be come a victualler, and to buy butter and cheese, and by making
sale thereof again to help to relieve his poor estate. Withal, he fell into
so strange and extreme a dropsy, that I scarcely believe the like was ever
heard of: neither truly do I speak this to amplify the matter, for all those
that have seen him beyond sea, will approve my speeches: either of his legs was
swollen to that bigness of a man's middle, his face only was bare of flesh and
miserable, and his eyes sunk into his head, in such sort, that I never
remember to have beheld a more pitiful spectacle: in which misery after he
had languished well near a year and a half, he died finally in extreme
calamity, as it is told me since, at Gaunt, in the year 1588.

Walsh only had this good hap, that he suruiued all the rest, of whom I will
speak the less, because there is scarcely any one in England that professes
arms, but knew both him and his fortunes. After the breaking of the regiment,
from a Captain he was feign to become a private soldier, and yet not thereunto
without great suit accepted, under Canullo de Mounts company of horsemen in
the garrison of Breda, which issuing one day forth of the town, was upon the
plains near adjoining encountered and defeated by sir Phillip Sidneys
company of English lances, Captain Walsh taken prisoner.
and among the rest Captain Walsh in two places grievously wounded, and taken
prisoner, and brought into Holland, where my L. of Leicester gave commandment
presently to hang him. Sir Phillip Sidney (being full of true honor) earnestly
entreated my Lord for his pardon, and obtained it, in respect that he knew him
to be valiant, and withal, that howsoever in this action transported, yet he
had ever borne a dutiful regard toward her Maieiestie. Whereupon being
recovered of his hurts, he served some while in the army under my L. of
Leicester as a private soldier. Afterward coming into England, he went with
my Lord Willoughbie as Ensign to one of his companies to the siege of Paris.
Lastly, he followed my L. of Essex into France, as a private soldier, where
his fortune was to be slain under the walls of Roane: Captain Walsh slain
under the walls of Roane.
and with his death finished the last act of this tragedy. Of which truly I
know not what you will judge that read, but sure I am that I who write it am
full of wonder and amazement, when with my self I consider in so short a space
the fall of so many men of great courage and valor, all taken away by violent
death. Which undoubtedly makes me assure my self that God does mightily
protect the cause of her Majesty, God does appara^tly protect the cause and
quarrel of her Majesty.
and will not suffer the disloialties of her unfaithful subjects to escape
unpunished, as by these most miraculous foreremembred examples most evidently
appears.

But now to proceed with my Discourse. Sir W. Stanley and R. York, ye one
rendering ye town of Deuenter, and the other the forte of Zutphen.
Shortly after came sir William Stanley and Rowland York, either of them being
a man of great courage, well approved valor, and long experience in the wars,
the one rendering unto the king the town of Deuenter, and the other betraying
the fort of Zutphen: the one being coronel over a regiment of foot, and the
other captain of a company of lances. Let us see the one and the others
prosperity, and the sequel of their usage under their new chosen master the
Spanish king. First sir W. Stanley was confirmed governor of the town which
he rendered, and his regiment left there in garrison, with the receipt of two
months pay. For a while he lived in the greatest applause that might be:
Cardinal Allen was written unto to Rome, to send down priests to instruct this
religious regiment. He informed the Pope thereof, who both wrote jointly unto
the king, to be good and gracious unto this regiment, which being well and
liberally entreated, as they had already at Rhemes and Rome a Seminary of
students and scholars, to pray and write for the Catholic cause of our
Country, so this being conducted by so worthy and Catholic a Gentleman as sir
William Stanley, might be a contynuall nurserie and seminary of souldyers to
fight for the same. A Treatise written by Cardinal Allen
Withal, Cardinal Allen wrote a book unto the Captains and soldiers of
this regiment, indeuoring therein to satisfy their consciences as touching the
justice of this action, and likewise animating them constantly to persevere in
this goodly course into the which they were now entered. Besides, down came
Priests thick and threefolde from France and Italy, catechizing these new
souldyers with many Masses and continual Sermons. Gentlemen that for their
conscience lay dispearsed in other parts, all drew down thither in hope of
this good payment and golden world that there was talked of. In the mean time
while the matters were thus in handling, there chanced to arise a great and
deadly contention between sir William Stanley and Rowland York, Quarrel
between sir William Stanley and York
which as you shall hear, yielded a very good and easy occasion to
overthrow them both, which to the end you may the better understand, I
think it not amiss to fetch the matter somewhat farther from the beginning.

Deuenter, whereof sir William Stanley was made governor by my Lord of
Leicester, is a fair City, chief and metrapolitane of the Province called
Ouerisel, which confineth on Frizeland, situated upon the inside of the river
Isel: not far thence upon the same river and the same side, stands a great
town called Zutphen, wherein there was for the king of Spain a governor
called Tassos, a Germane borne, and of obscure parents, but himself of notable
courage, Tassos governor of Zutphe^.
and by degrees and deserts was grown unto these parts to great reputation
and commandment, next in authority to Verdugo, who was General of Frizeland,
Ouerisel, Zutphen, and the bordering places: he had first trained Tassos up to
the wars, Verdugo Lieutenant general of Frizeland.
and given him from time to time such charges and preferments, as at length he
had brought him to be in a manner equal with himself in dignity, insomuch
that at last he began to suspect his greatness, and would have clipped his wings,
but could not, for the other was passing ambitions, full of courage, and by
name and many deserts known unto the king, so that in no sort he would let
himself be touched in the lest jot of his greatness and reputation, whereupon
each of them bare a secret grudge and rancor to the other, which came by this
means to be more inflamed. For sir W. Stanley having in his mind fully
determined the rendition of Deuenter, entered into secret practice with Tassos
for the perfourming thereof, who with all gladness and secrecy entertained his
offer til such time as the town was rendered into the hands of Tassos, Quarrel
between Tassos and Verdugo
upon such agreements and conditions as between them were concluded, Tassos
exceedingly rejoiced at the honor of his enterprise, and received both from
the King and the D. of Parma many thanks and promises of reward, for his
diligence and discreet behavior therein. Then the which nothing could be more
displeasing and bitter to Verdugo, who being governor of the province, and
having the forces in his hand, took it as an exceeding disgrace and scorn done
unto him, that an inferior person, such as he reckned Tassos to be, should
underhand accomplish so great an exploit, and go away with the honor thereof,
and he in the mean time remain stale and neglected, as a man utterly accounted
unworthy so much as once to be acquainted therewith, so that from that time
forward he nourished in his heart a deadly hatred against Tassos and sir
William Stanley. In the mean time Rowland Yorkes company of horsemen was
confirmed unto him by the Duke of Parma, and both he and they sent down to
lie in garrison at Deuenter: where of the one side he taking upon him more
commandment that sir William Stanley thought to be convenient, and on the
other side scorning to live as a private Captain in a town of garrison,
(especially under the commandment of one of his Nation, to whom he judged
himself no way inferior in worthiness) they began to enter into a great mislike
one of the other, and by degrees into deadly quarrels and challenges, as some
now in England can well testify, who were mediators between them.
Nevertheless by mean of friends they grew again to reconciliation, though
the same was but from the teeth outward, and continued not long. York
practiced with Verdugo to dispossess Sir W. Stanley of the government of
Deuenter.
For York in the mean time having discovered Verdugos humor, fell secretly to
practice with him, a mean whereby to thrust sir William and his companies out
of the town, hoping, (and therein being by Verdugo comforted and confidently
assured) that upon the remove of sir William, the government of the town
should remain wholly in himself: whereupon he ceased not to beat into Verdugos
ears (that were of nothing more desirous than of these news) the wavering
inconstant humors of sir William Stanley, the offers made unto him by my L. of
Leicester, and his other friends in England, especially of the small affection
his soldiers had to the service of the Spanish king, who desired nothing more
than an occasion to recover the favor of their Country, which by no means
they should so soon procure, as by redeliuering the town. Assuring him that
there were to this end great practices in hand, which could not but turn to a
dangerous issue if they should not be in time prevented. Presently thereupon
Verdugo wrote unto the D. of Parma, aggreuating the matter with so many
additio^s of his own, that the D. counted the town as half lost already,
though in truth I think there was never any such matter pretended, and
presently sent down a straight commission to Verdugo, to draw three of the
six companies, over which sir William Stanley was governor, out of the town,
under color of succouring Monsieur de Haultpen, brother to the Earl of
Barlamont, who was in the fields with some few forces, taking in certain
places of Gelderland. Verdugo was nothing slow to execute this Commission, but
caused it to be accomplished with all speed, thrusting in their place certain
companies of his own into the town: and within a while after he so practiced,
that sir William Stanley with his other three Companies, were under the like
color of service commanded also to come forth, Sir W. Stanley and his company
drawn out of Deuentre
being told that he should presently return into it again, which as yet to
this day he never did. But by this fine devise was eased of his government, and
such goods as he and his soldiers left, were spoiled and made booty of, even
as though they had pertained to public enemies: since which time this regiment
of seminary soldiers with all their religion, were never trusted in any
town, nor as I believe, ever shall be. Being now joined with the troops of
Haultpenne, they chanced to encounter the enemy hard by Balduke, where the
Italians and Burgonians, over which Captain Haultpenne had charge, playing
exceedingly the cowardes, they only behaved themselves, though with loss of
many of their lives, so manfully, and with such courage, that they grew over
the whole country into a marvelous reputation of good soldiers. But leaving
here Haultpenne their general wounded to death, they marched down into
Brabant, Haultpen slain in an encounter not far from Balduke
where for recompense of their late good service, they were wintered in the
field, without money, and in such great misery, nakedness, and poverty, that
ten weeks together their chiefest food and sustenaunce in Turnot, was dried
akornes that they found in sellers, which diet the priests not liking of, came
to their Coronell to Antwarpe, who to avoid the lamentations and complaints of
his soldiers, had gotten him thither before, where one Oliver Eustace, an
Irish Gentleman, told him to his face that he was the author of these poor
men's misery, and therefore bound in conscience to procure them some relief.
Sir William bit his lip, knowing well that he had told him truth, and their
calamity went to his very heart, but how to remedy it he knew not, and
therefore absented himself in Antwarpe, where you should never have found his
table without four or five priests, some of the which were in their behavior
and words far more insolent and sausie than the meekness of their vocation
required, insomuch that the Captains and Gentlemen took such grief and
scandal at their controlling humor, that they left sir William Stanley wholye
abandoned and unfrequented. Some did much wonder how a Gentleman of his
worthiness and courage could endure these indignities, as to suffer himself
to be directed and governed by them, especially in such matters as concerned
not their vocation. I wit not touch for some respects herein any particulars,
but if you speak with Captain Heart, who was then sir Williams Lieutenant, or
with Captain Salsburie, who are now both in England, they will satisfy you
farther in this matter, none can better speak it than they, especially the
last named, because he opposed himself, and had sure sunk under the burden,
if that his wit and courage had not carried him thorough. Once sir William
Stanly began to look it, and to avoid both that and other inconveniences,
took (some years since) his journey into Spain, Sir W. Stanley took his
journey into Spain
partlye to secure unto himself some estate of living, of which he now
(considering this dealing) began to doubt, partly by the inuitation of the
Jesuits, with which order he is exceedingly enchanted, Sir William Stanley
wholly drected by the Jesuits
and to them wholye subjected, who dealte for him in such sort with the
Cardinal, that he presently sent Parsons away into Spain, to infourme the
King of his worthynesse and virtue: and wythall, He took with him into Spain
Hugh Owen, and George Parsons brother to Parsons the Jesuit. He sent E: Crisp
before to Rome to solicit his matters with ye Cardinal, who returning thence
met him afterward in Spain.
of his experience of the sea coasts of England, but especially of his
intelligence about Ireland, which in truth he presumes to be very great.
Parsons played his part in such forte, that sir William Stanley was presently
sent for, who upon his arrival did what he couide to persuade the King to
send forces for Ireland, but belyke there was not such great credit given
him as he expected there should be, insomuch that he wrote Letters to Holte
the Jesuit, being in Brussels, (which is his countriman, and one upon whom
he chiefly relieth) of great coffeehouse, signifying that his intertainment
was far colder than he expected. Sir W: Stanley sent to Coronia
Within short space after he was sent down to the kings navy, lying at
Coronia, where a while he remained with the Adelantado. In the mean time his
regiment began to drop and droup away, in such sort, that what for lack of
sustena^ce, and through ill usage, the number of them was so melted, that they
were not in all above an hundred and fifty: and for the chifest captains,
leaders, and gentlemen, they did both so much mislike the base handling of
matters, and also the practices there daily set abroch against their country,
Sir W: Stanley forsaken by his Captains
that they made (by means) intercession to her majesty for their pardon, which
of her merciful and royal benignity she granted, so that such of them as
remain alive, do enjoy their Country, and can testify this which I have said
to be true. But now to return to York, who^ I left in Dauentre, assured both
by Verdugos promises and his own hopes, of the towns government: when he saw
Grave Harman make his enterie as new created governor by the Dukes
appointment, you must imagine that it grieved him to the very gall: but forced
he was to dissemble it with his best patience. Nevertheless having in the town
a gallant company of lances, in despite of them he flourished and bare his head
aloft, ranging and scouring over the whole country, bringing in daily great
booties, and growing rich. This prosperity of his was a great blemish in their
eye, for they knew him to be discontented and of a dangerous humor, so that
they did not greatly trust him: him therefore fairly one day at dinner they
caused to be poisoned, where likewise poisoned with him young Richard Souch,
and Robert Fenne priest, York poisoned by ye Spaniard. Richard Souch and
Robert Fen priest
but he belike having swallowed the chief substance, they only met with the
drams, so that he died miserably, and they fell sick and brake out into many
pustules and biles, yet afterward recovered, and did give this testimony, his
breath was no sooner out of his body, but Trias, a Spanish Captain, and Grave
Harman, the new governor, rusht into his lodging, to break up his coffers, in
which being withstoode by Yorkes Lieutenant John Bowcer, and by Edward Bowcer
his brother, I: Bowcer and his borther Edward Bowcer murdered by the Spaniard
they caused their gardes at noone days to enter in upon them, and most
inhumanely and barbarously to murder them both in their own presence: which
worthy exploit being performed, they brake up his coffers, took out his
jewels, plate, and money, of which they found great store, appropriating the
same to their own use, as likewise they did his horses, arms, and furniture,
though he by testament had bequeathed them to a little youth, his brothers
son, called Edmond York, being then in those parts with him. Lastly, they
chased his whole company out of the town, Yorkes company barbarously
entreated by the Spaniard
and spoiled their baggage at the gates, who (poor men) seeing their Captain
poisoned, their Lieutenant murdered, and themselves so vnchristanly dealt
withal, repaired to Verdugo, imploring his help and assistaunce in so hard an
extremity, who for recompense, very charitably cashierd them al without the
receipt of one penny.

Afterward when the fame of this poisoning grew rife abroad, they gave out and
published, that some one had done it suborned thereunto by the Council of
England, but if there had bin no other proof (as there were infinite) yet the
sequel of their doings, their murdering of his friends, and the robbing of
his treasure, showed by whom it was done, and whereat they aimed. Thus much as
touching the usage which they receued from the king and his ministers: now
keeping the course I began, let us see with what prosperity it pleased God to
bless this action of sir William Stanleys, and those whom he used as
instruments therein.

After his coming into the kings service, he divided his regiment, which was
the greatest part Irish, into six companies. The leading of his own company
he gave to Peter Win, The names of sir W. Stanleys Captains
in which room afterward, (master Win discharging himself) he placed one
Heart, an old soldier and follower of his. The other five companies he gave to
Gwin, Salsburie, Eaton, Reinolds, and Harrison, the sargeant maiorship he gave
to one Simon Scurlocke, an Irish Gentleman, but above all the rest, he himself
conuersed most in kindness of love and affection with one R. Ashton, who had bin
his bedfellow, and the greatest furtherer of him in this enterprise. The four
first named, after humble suite made unto her Majesty's honorable council for
their pardon, returned into England, and employed themselves with great
commendation in her Majesty's service.

Gwin went first with my Lord of Essex, and lastly with sir Roger Williams over
into France, as sargeant mayor of his regiment, Captain Gwin slain before
Roane
where being wounded in a skirmish before the walls of Roane, he languished
thereof grievously some three or four weeks, and finally ended his days at
Diep.

Peter Win likewise went over with my L. of Essex into France, and now lastly
hearing of the Turks desent into Hungary, Captain Peter Win slain in Hungary
by the Turks
obtained leave to go serve in the Christian army against him, where he was
exceedingly well entertained, and honored with the leading of a company of
footmen. But now in the late overthrow given by the Turk to Archduke Mathias,
it is reported that he was slain. I could wish the report to be untrue, for
he was a man of singular good parts, and might have done her Majesty much
good service. Captain Eaton died in the Portingall voyage


James Eaton went the Portingall voyage with sir Frances Drake, where with the
extremity of sickness he died on the way.

Only Captain Salsburie lives, but has tasted his part of as much adverse
fortune, as truly I think, his very enemies could wish him.

Captain Reynoldes died at Brussels of a bloody flix
Reinolds laboring with all instance by his friends here in England for his
pardon, was prevented of his return by a cruel bloody flix, of the which he
died in Brussels.

Harison was one morning, as the companies marched, run thorough the body and
slain, Captain Harison slain by a soldier of the regiment
by a baggage fellow of the regiment, who^ he had strike^ the night before

Scurlocke the sargeant mayor, straggling with certain of the soldiers abroad,
was incountred by the pesants, Scurlocke the Sargeant mayor burnt alive by the
pesants
and chased up into a Church steeple, where finally both he and they, refusing
to submit themselves to the fury of the clownes, were burnt alive.

Roger Ashton coming lately into England, was apprehended and executed at
Tiburne for treason. Roger Ashton executed for high treason
If God himself lay it down as one of his blessings, that he will give the
righteous long and many happy days on the earth, surely then the taking of
these men away in the best of their years by such violent ends, in my
judgment is an apparantargume^t of his wrath, from which of his divine and
inestimable mercy, I beseech him to deliver us.

Neither were it only the Captains that thus perished, but in a manner all
the rest, though I trouble you not with their particular names and discourses,
in so much, that lately (the old English and Irish soldiers being worn out,
sir W. Stanley was feign to fill up his regiment with Wallons and Dutchmen)
appointing new Captains over them, Jacques, Lieutenant Coronell to sir W.
Sta^ley
and making one Jacques Francesco his Lieutenant Coronell: one borne in Antwarp
of Italian parents, but from his infancy brought up in England, and in many
duties tied both to the nation, and to sundry Gentlemen of the same, for many
their loves and liberalities toward him, especially to the late Lord
Chancellor, whom he served, and who had always bin his especial good friend
and fauorer. He followed a while the wars of Ireland, where he behaved
himself so well, that he was advanced to honest degrees in her Majesty's
service, such as among soldiers are accounted honorable and of reputation, at
length being brought thence, not without great suspicion of ill carrying
himself in matter of allegiance to her Majesty, yet he found such assured
friends, that he did not only recover his liberty and freedom, but also
tasted very deeply of their liberalities, such, as I think some of them,
though very honorable, scarcely ever used the like to any, and engaged with
these courtesies, which for ever would have tied a thankful mind, he was
suffered to depart the realm. All which notwithstanding, it is reported, that
there is not any beyond the sea, that does run a more violent and vnreuerent
course against the person of her Majesty, and the state of our Country than
he does, at which truly I do much wonder, how a mind not altogether void of
reason and humanity, can suffer it self to sink into so deep a degree of
ingratitude. Let him yet at length look into his own conscience, and if so
many benefits received claim not his fidelity and service, yet at least let
them keep him from attempting villainy, I speak this in respect of his own
good, and not that he nor ten thousand more such as he is, is able to do her
Majesty or her realm a halfepenie worth of harm, for the mighty hand of
God, and the approved valor of her faithful subjects are able, and will
always defend and protect her against whatsoever violence of whosoever her
malicious enemies, who hitherto have done her no farther harm, than themselves
to perish, and to be confounded in their own devises, and I hope it shall
never be otherwise. But as for Jacques, if he will needs run on his desperate
course, forgetful of the oaths and protestations he made when he departed out
of England, let him likewise attend that scourge and punishment which ever
follows such infidelity.

As for the other Captains and Gentlemen that have any true English blood in
them, let them yet (for they are those to whom I chiefly intend my speeches)
look with a discreeter judgment into the depth of their estates, let them not
tire out their years and youth in so comfortles and unrewarded a service, the
end whereof is never other than untimely death, desolatio^, or beggerie, let
them not trust themselves to sleep in the bosom of a flattering stepmother,
that holds a knife in her hand to cut their throats, when they may securely
throw themselves into the arms of a loving natural mother, that will receive
them, coming like penitent and obedient children, with true tears and perfect
joy. Let them cast back their eyes upon the glory and greatness of her
Majesty, their sovereign Princess, who in deed is a true and loving mother
to us all, let them but look into the happy and blessed estate of their
native Country, and finally consider the duty they do owe unto them both.
They are not yet so far past, but that their submission may be received:
yea, and such services they may do, highly rewarded too.

But leaving these digressions, to which I know not what zeal transporteth me,
judge now (I pray you) what reward, honor, and advancement you may expect of
the king of Spain, that never deserved of him any favor or good usage, when
you see these men suffered to perish, and that in so miserable estate, that
have done him so many, so great, and so weighty services. But perchance you
will say that he has dealt better with private men tha^ he has done with
those tumultuous militar troops: if you can name me but any one that he has
raisd or advanced to honor, or that lives richly or wealthily in his service,
I will name you an hundred that being Gentlemen of good houses and of worthy
merit, have consumed, languished, and been brought to nothing in his service,
yea, and some of the^ perished and died for lack of sustenance. You perchance
will name Hugh Owen, and in good faith he is the only man that ever I knew
advanced, Hugh Owen
credited, or graced in his service: and yet (God wot) all that he gets is
no more than to maintain him in a mean estate or show, with a man only or two
to serve him: where on the other side, I will reckon you up of those that are
only for want of things necessary, and of pure poverty, Sundry English
Gentlemen of good houses yt have perished in the King of Spaines service.
consumed and dead, M. Dakers, Michael Tempest, old Norton, Israel Harman,
Markenfield, Tremaine, Stradling, Henry Carew, Edward Allen, Fleming,
Suthwell, Bulmer, with sundry others of good race and credit in their country.

But to recite unto you the names of those that do yet live so poorly and
uncomfortably in his pension, would be a matter too tedious, and therefore take
them all in general, C. Paget only excepted, who came well furnished with
crowns out of England, and likewise inherited many good things that my L.
Paget left unto him at his death, and examine them one from another from my L.
of Westmerland down even to the very lowest, and if there be in the whole
world a more miserable and discontented troop of Gentlemen, let me never be
credited in any thing else that I shall tell you. And because you shall your
self the better judge, I will tell you what payment they have of such pensions
as the king has given them.

They had granted them at Bruges the first day of August, in the year one
thousand five hundred eighty eight, a general Liberanca, to receue three
months pay a piece of their pensions. But first before I go any further, I
think it very necessary to let you understand what manner of thing this
Liberanca is, of which I speak, to the end that you may be acquainted with
the inventions and crafty delays that they use in this matter of payment: for
if you have not especial favor, it will be six months after the grant
thereof, do what you can, before it will be fully signed, and in estate, (...)
manner of payment that is that is granted by way of Liberanca
for you to demand your money. A Liberanca, is a bill of assignation for the
receite of money granted to some one in particular, or to two or three
jointly, or a hundred or more, as occasion shall require, it is first drawn,
and underneath signed by the chief Secretory that attends on the general:
it is directed by the Duke unto the treasurer general, commanding him to pay
the same of whatsoever money he shall have within his charge, but first to see
that the same be perused and registered in both the offices of the two Contadors
of the army, and signed with their names and rubrikes, and then that it be
likewise registered, perused and rubrikt by the Veedor general, and signed with
his name. The Veedor is as it were a censor or ouerseer of all the other
officers, and is a man of great and principal dignity
After this he expresses the causes that moves him to grant the sum of
money to the party that brings the Liberanca, with many other
particularities. This is the manner of a Liberanca, without which there is not
there any payment made of money to any man, unless it be by secret billets
from the general, which are but seldom, and that upon secret and sudden
causes, as treachery, intelligence, or espial, or some such base matter as
requires secrecy, and not to be delaid. The words of such billets, Payment
by secret billets.
are to command the treasurer to pay unto the bringer for secret services, so
much money as is therein expressed: which without more words, being signed with
the Dukes hand, is presently dispached. But unless it have bin to some notable
spy, few such billets have fallen to any Englishmans share. As for the
Liberanca, which is the ordinary and usual kind of payment, after that by
tedious labor and solicitation, a man has in six months space gotten all
their hands, yet in a manner he is never the nearer, for some of the^ are never
paid, and scarcely any til they be two or three years old, if in the mean
time the party loose his Liberanca, there is no recovery of a new by any
means possible: if he die, no benefit thereof rises to his wife, children,
or heirs, for a Liberanca is never paid but personally to him in whose name it
is first granted. If it be with long carriage fretted, or the names of those
that signed it obscured, it is a sufficient cavil to frustrate the payment,
insomuch that one Camel, A pretty jest of one Camel, a Scotchman
a Scotchman, came with a fair piece of parchment in his hand, to Cosmo the
Secretorie, humbly desiring that his Liberanca might be therein engrossed, for
in paper he was sure it would be worn out before he should recover the payment.

Such a Liberanca (I say) as this was granted to the English pensioners in
the year abouesayde, for three months pay, of which till October in the year
1590. I am sure they had not received one penny, how long they staid without it
afterward I know not; for of later time I cannot give any so certain
assurance, only the common report is, that things there are not much bettered,
but now especially since the Duke of Parmas death much impaired.

Their necessity was great, and they followed the Duke from town to town,
importunatly requiring payment, but especially they never left Cosmo, the
Dukes Secretorie in quiet, who to rid himself of their troublesome
importunities, addressed them to Baptista Spinola, a Genouese Banker dwelling
in Antwarpe, giving them his Letter, and sending the same by one Henry
Haslewood, requesting him to relieve those distressed English Gentlemen, and to
buy their Liberanca, which he doubted not but they would sell good cheap
greatly to his profit: the whole sum was ten thousand crowns, which Cosmo
promised him should be allowed and passed in the reckoning which he had with
the king. Haslewood in the name of the rest offered him the said sum for six
thousand: but Spinola utterly refused the same, saying he would not take it for
two thousand: and withal, he desired that he might not meddle any more with
the king, wishing that he had not meddled with him so much. So that they were
feign to return poor and pennylesse, and did in that instant of which I
speak, live in so poor and pitiful, a sort, that truly it was a grief to
see it: insomuch that I knew a Gentleman that sold his part there, amounting
to 24. pounds, for three pounds. But perchance you will say he gives great
pensions, and intertaineth many of our nation. It is true in deed, in show he
does so, and therewith does bleare the worlds eyes, with an appearance of great
liberality. But his payment and usage considered, (I protest unto you that I
speak unfeignedly) I do not know any estate of life in England so mean, which
I do not much prefer before being here a pensioner to the king of Spain. I
leave the judgment of the truth hereof to those that have tried it: you have
many of them amongst you, confer with them, and examine them upon their
conscience. As for my part, in good faith I cannot imagine the cause why he
intertaineth us, unless it be to use us as stales to allure others,
co^nsidering the hatred that he and his bears us, and so under the dissembled
color of a false affection, at length to overthrow us all.

Thus much I dare boldly say, because through the conference that I have had
with them I do know it assuredly, that even those of our nation which do most
serve his turn, howsoever in outward appearance they seem for some particular
causes to magnify and extol his liberality, yet in their own secret
conceits they do imagine and know nothing in the world to be more
reproachful, base, and contemptible, than to be an Entretenido in the king of
Spaines service, especially if he serve not in the wars, and have his
entertainment assigned him in some company or other, which few or none of our
Countrymen have, chiefly those of the better sort. As for those that have
their pensions granted them to follow the court without any obligation of
service, as in a manner all the pensions granted to the Englishmen are, the
Spanish soldier makes the most base and contemptible reckoning of them that
may be, even as of men that live by charity, as our poor knights do at
Windsore. English pensioners there utterly scorned and unregarded
But to the end you may in this point clearly discern the manner of their
usage, you must understand that the king grants two manner of pensions or
extraordinary paies, bestowing upon men of desert either of them, as the
occasion and the quality of their service shall require: the one called by the
name of Entertainment, and the other Ventaja in the Patents wherein they are
granted. The difference between two kinds of pensions or paime^ts, which the
king gives to such as serve him, ye one called Entretenume^to, ye other
Ventaja.
The first which they call Entertainment, is such as is granted to our
Countrymen, and to straggling Italians, and to some cashierd Captains, such as
are of best regard, and to strangers of other nations, who are never paid till
the whole army be satisfied, and al other occasions defraid, then if any
overplus remain, which seldom happens, somewhat thereof perchance may come to
their share. This pension is very casual, and has often bin abolished and
taken away quite, as well from the English as from all other nations: witness
Charles Brown, Hugh Owen, and Ralfe Ligons, that were feign four years since,
upon that occasion to go into Spain, where after long and great suit, they
brought down order again to have the same renewed, yet still commonly once a
year there comes an allarum among the^, that the king will not be any longer
at the charge of so many pensions, and in danger to be turned out of pay. And
some three or four years agone they were all commanded to go down to the
army, and to put themselves in service under some company, or otherwise not
to expect any pension or payment: which how unfitting it is, and unworthy to
men brought up in other courses, as most of them are, I leave to your
judgment, yet the misery of that bondage to which they have subjected
themselves, must endure al: and which is most miserable, must not complain when
they are stricken. The other paime^t or pension which is called Ventaya, as it
is much more honorable, because (though very usual among the Spaniards and
all other nations, ours excepted) yet they are never granted but upon pretense
of good service don, or some duenes of desert: they that have the^ are more
respectively regarded and better paid than the other, and they are never taken
from them, so long as they follow the kings service. Many of our nation have
served among the Spaniards, yet to this day did I never know any one graced
with one of these Ventayas, though they are common to all other nations, yea,
even to the Germans, though granted to the^ by the name of Sobrepagas, which
in effect is all one.

If I were guilty to my self, that this which I do write were untrue, I
should greatly fear the shame of reprofe in a matter so manifest, especially
there being now in England many that are as well or better acquainted with
these matters than my self, and can contradict me where I err. But grounding
my self upon the confidence of an assured truth, I cannot but wonder, these
things being so, how any that has the true feeling of that which pertains
to the honor of a gentleman, ca^ endure an usage so scornful and contumelious
as this which daily they receive from the Spaniard: of which if you desire one
example for all, this may satisfy you which follows. The most contemptible
usage of the English at Bruges
At such time as the Duke of Parma lay at Bruges, busy about his preparations
for England, and attending the Spanish fleet, when they all expected to be made
knights, Coronels, Captains, and conducters of the army, and to be filled
with crowns, they were so far from those matters with which they flattered
themselves, that in sted of being honored and advanced, they were the only
rejected and contemned people that followed the court, all nations else being
relieved with some months pay, they onley excepted. And which is more, whereas
they moved the duke sundry times to know his pleasure, how he would dispose of
them in that journey, telling him besides, that upon the well usage of them
depended much matter of importance, as the alluring and drawing unto them other
Gentlemen of their kinsmen and friends, who upon hope of the like good usage,
honor, and aduanceme^t, would be able to do great service upon their landing,
whereas contrariwise seeing them come over so poor in show, without credit,
money, or arms, like lackies, (for so were the words of their request) it
would be a cause to terrify them from undertaking of any such course: they
were by the Duke scornfully and with derision rejected, neither did he
vouchsafe to give them any other answer, than only that he would think upon
it. But on the night in which upon the hurly burly of the coming of the
Spanish navy, they thought to imbarke, he departed toward Donckerk, leaving
them all behind, not thinking them any way worthy to be called upon, or to be
taken with him. Wheruepon the Earl of Westmerland, the L. Paget, and sundry of
the better sort, laid their heads together, and made their complaint unto the
D. of Pastrana, (who was newly come out of Spain with great favors from the
king, The D. of Pastrana supposed to be the kings bastard
and there lived in great honor and applause among the Spaniards) but by him,
some say, they were as basely and scornfully handled as by the other. The
Spaniards did much disdain their aggrauation of their ability and means to
facilite the kings enterprise for England, insomuch that one Don Ambrosio, a
man of principal quality, asked them in cholar whether they thought the king
of Spain not puisant enough to win England with out them and their friends.
This evil entreaty wrought so great an apprehension in my L. Paget (who both
in regard of his fathers especial credit in times past with the king, The L:
Paget died at Brussels
as also of his own quality and carriage, had presumed upon much better
usage) that he retired him self to Brussels, where what with the conceit of
this grief, and what with other accidents, he shortly ended his life. Sir W.
Stanley took it also in such disdainful sort, that he was not called to the
counsel of the wars, (whereas he presumed and gave out, that no man in the
army knew more, or was better able in this voyage tha^ himself,) that he
sequestered himself from the court, and coming discontented to Antwarp, there
hired a house, where four or five months he lived full of melancholy and
passion, making evident show that his mind was utterly unable to bear the
burden of so great an indignity.

But whosoever lives there, must be contented to endure this and a great
deal more, for the Spaniards will not be by any means persuaded, that those
of our nation living there with them are gentlemen of good houses, qualities,
and living in England but rather take them to be such as the Banditi of Italy,
men fled out of their Country for theft, debt, robbery, or manslaughter, The
speeches of a Spanish Captain to sir W: Stanley
as a Captain of them spared not plainly to tell sir W. Stanley in the passage
boat between Antwarpe and Brussels, saying that he could not but exceedingly
wonder what should move a man, being rich, well descended, and of good living
in his Country, to change the same for the service of an opposite foreign
Prince, swearing a great oath that all the religion in the world should not make
him to do the like.

The monstrous hateful speeches of ye Spaniards, condemning such of our nation
as served among them
Likewise a great company of them standing round together in a ring (as their
manner is) upon the mere Brigge in Antwarpe, and seeing certain English
gentlemen pass by, one of them, and he a Captain, by name Lucas, well known
by his red beard, balde head, and maimed arms, said that he wondered what
the King made with any such vermin in his Country. Another of them swear a
great oath, that look how many English men there were in the kings service,
there were so many spies and traitors: the third said it were an alms deed to
put them al in sacks and to throw them into the river: but the fourth very
gently replied, that it would be a better course to send them down to the
kings galleys, where in regard of their big joints and broad shoulders, they
could not but prove good tuggers at an oar. But these being but the speeches
of private men, might the better be borne, Speeches of the treasurer general
to Thomas Throckmorto^.
were they not confirmed by men of greater sort: which whether it be so or no,
ask T. Throckmorton, who talking with Iuan de Lasture, the kings treasurer
general, one day upon the walls of Brussels, wondered why the king having such
prete^ces for England, made no more reckoning of such Englishmen as followed
him, who in regard of their parentage and inteligence might be able to do him
great services, if they were hartned with somewhat better usage: whereas now by
reason of their poverty and drouping, they were not fit for any thing. To
which the treasurer replied, that he was not ignorant of the estate, quality,
and condition of all such Englishmen as followed the king, but for his part
(swearing a Spanish oath or two) he knew not any one of the^ in regard of
ability to do the king service, worth the straw that lay under his foot.

The like answer in a manner was given by Francesco Blancocauallo, his vize
treasurer in Antwarpe, to captain Pernay and other Gentlemen, who being denied
by him the payment of certain money they demanded, and speaking of the
services they had done unto the king: he answered that he knew not what
services they had done, or were able to do, unless it were to spend the kings
money in tauernes and brothell houses. The like they received from, Sammariba,
the Veedors chief officer, but that the same was accompanied with worse
effects. For Captain Barney laying hand on his rapier, making proffer to
revenge the hardness of such speeches as were offered him, was presently
environed among them, and run thorough the doublet in a place or two, not
without exceeding danger of his life.

But by the way I think it not amiss to tell you a merry accident that fell
out between the treasurer and one Captain Smith, an Englishman, A pretty jest
between captain Smith and the tresurer general
spoken of before in this Treatise: who being one day well tipled, came in all
have to demand his money of I. de Lasture. He seeing him come in that
vnreuerent sort, grew so far gone with cholar as the other was with wine,
and reviled him by many foul names, as Perro, Luterano, Borachio, etc. Smith
had not a word of Spanish, nor any other language but a little Dutch, wherein
he requited the treasurer in as snarling terms as he could, calling him
Honscont, Schellam, and Turk. Wherewith the treasurer came in a great rage,
and would have thrust him down the stairs, but Smith drew out his dagger, and
had without doubt mischieued him, if Coronell Boid and other Scottish Gentlemen
that were there present as suitors for money had not come between them. The
matter came before the Duke, who as always haring I. de Lasture exceedingly,
made but a jest of it, and Smith being sober submitted himself, imputing his
fault to the wine, and so the matter was ended.

I could recite unto you a thousand the like things as these, but they are not
worthy the remembering. Returning therefore to my purpose: They are so jealous
and suspicious of us, that if any thing prove untowardly in their service,
they think it straight to be don by our especial means and intelligence, as
upon the taking of Axhill by that honorable and worthy soldier sir P. Sidney,
The exceeding jealousy of the Spaniards over the English that erue amongst h^em.
Mondragon presently imprisoned Pigot within the castle of Gaunt, took away
all things whatsoever he had worth any thing, and the rest he caused his men
to rifle and steal, saying openly, that we were all traitors and spies. And if
you desire further confirmation of the good opinion and confidence they have of
us, tell me what Companies of English they have trusted within these ten
years in garrison, I am sure you cannot name one. And whereas sundry English
Gentlemen have instantly sued to have their pensions granted them in the
castles of Anwarp or Gant, because the payment is there somewhat better, no one
has hitherto bin able to obtain the same, so base and of no regard is the
estate in which they live. I could allege unto you many other examples of
mighty wrongs and disgraces offered unto our nation, whereby they might (if
they list) easily discover the hatred the Spaniard bears them, the suspicious
jealousy with which they ouerlooke them, and the danger wherein they stand to
have one day all their throats cut. And that this hard dealing and hatred of
theirs proceeds not of any demerit of the English but of a rooted and
ingrafted malice of the Spaniards to our whole nation, may by many actions of
theirs be proved and made manifest. Eor whenever the fortune of the wars
has delivered any of us into their hands, it is strange to think with what
greedy and insatiable thirst they have desired to shed English blood. The
cruelty of the Spaniards at Rosendale
As for example: At Rosendale, where sundry English regiments being by the
Marshall Biron abandoned and betrayed, were by them defeated and overthrown,
it is scarcely credible what barbarous cruelty they used upon men re^dred, and
demanding mercy upon their knees. But admit all cruelty tolerable during the
fury of an execution (though among christians, and men of noble and valorous
minds, there is yet a moderation to be used) what bloody inhumanitie was ever
heard the like to that which they used the next day. For whereas the Italians
and Burgonians (moved with a souldierly compassion) had taken many English
prisoners, and saved them from the former slaughter: upon the next mornings
march, as they brought them forth, thinking to lead the^ quietly home to
their quarter, the Spaniards with a hellish fury, crying Matta, Matta, drew
their rapiers, and murdered with many wounds these poor naked men, Matta,
Matta, Kill, Kill
not suffering a man of them to escape alive.

Likewise in that treacherous and sinonicall practice of Graueling, Their
treachery and cruelty at Grueling
wherein they thought to have intrapped noble sir P. Sidney, how cruelly and
tiranously did they use those poor men of ours, that were sent before to
discover it. Al were safe, according to promise, whom after they had received
into their gates with friendly salutations, and entertained a good space in the
town, in the end when they saw the success of the enterprise answered not
their bloody, traitorous, and unmanly expectation, they disarmed and unclothed
them in the market place, and finally, like cruel butchers, and not like
honorable soldiers, murdered them every one.

We have not (thanks be to God) wanted occasion many times since to cry
quittaunce with them, as namely at the fort of Bergues, where by Grimstones
practice they were brought to the trappe. There were gentlemen of good worth
there present, that advised my L. Willoughby to serve them with the same
measure as they had served the poor Englishmen at Graueling. But he having
ever in all his actions followed the way of honor, disdained vnnobly to
imbase his hands with the unworthy blood of men rendered and unable to resist.
Likewise after the overthrow of that their late fleetes (which before hand they
termed Invincible) when such numbers of them were taken, that the prisons of
London were not capable of them, if her Majesty would have followed the
example of their own nation, she might have used them as Don Iuan did the
Wallons after the battle of Ieblours; The cruelty of the Spaniardes toward
ye Wallons after ye battle of Ieblours
where taking very near 2000. of them prisoners, the next day after the
battle he caused them to be bound two and two together, and to be tumbled
headlong over the bridge of Namures into the river of Meuse. But her majesty
like a Christian princess, full of royal magnanimity (though the mischiuous
intention of their coming, and the horrible cruelties they that pretended were
not unknown unto her) yet caused them to be dispersed into several
convenient places, and there upon her charge to be provided for: and lastly, to
be sent over into Flanders, The nobleness and mercy of her majesty toward
the Spanish prisoners
accompanied with ships, artillery, and sufficient conuoy of men to warrant
their safety by the way. Likewise she permitted those that had bin cast a land
in Scotland, quietly to pass along her narrow seas, yea, and accompanied them
with her safeconduit, though she well knew that their ariuall in the low
Countries could not but be a great reenforcement to the weakened troops of her
armed enemy the Duke of Parma.

The affection then of the Spaniard being such toward us and our nation as you
have heard, I hope those before remembered examples, shall be sufficient to
assure and persuade you, that under the k. of Spains dominion and government
there is not any wealth, honor, or advancement to be gotten, but contrariwise,
poverty, peril, jealousy, and disgrace.

Now let us see touching the points of conscience and repose in religion, if
the same be to be found here, such as you expect. In a matter of religion I
will not take upon me to dispute* but will leave the decision thereof to men

(which surely if it bring not forth better fruits, will hardly be proved to be
the true tree) Let us now come to the contentment which you might here receive

countrymen as are here of the same profession and religion.

Divisions, factions, and partialities among the fugitives
First, I think you are not ignorant of the divisions, partialities, and
factions that are between the^, which surely are such, that I think scarcely
in the world there is to be found such a divided sorcerie of men, I speak it
not in respect of private quarrels and contentions, wherein they have often
wounded, maimed, and slain one another: but I mean in regard of different and
long enduring factions, Four factions or sorts of humors among ye fugitives
wherein great parts of them are most maliciously opposite one against
another, to the great prejudice and slander of them all. For you must consider
that there are amongst their four sorts of humors, of which each sorts
himself to his semblable. The one, (and I name them first, for otherwise they
would not take it well) pretend to be great state-men and deep politicians,
Men of state and policy.
these will not vouchsafe to look on any other book but such as treat of
high matter, policy, and government, as Bodins Commonwealth, Machiuels Prince,
Lipsius his Politikes, Manutius his Laws, and such like. Neither is there any
of these, no not the least, but thinks himself sufficient to be a Magnifico of
Venice. There is a second sort, wholly devoted to the following and faction of
the Jesuits, Iesuitisted
serving them as their espials and instruments in whatsoever they employ them:
these are very hateful to the rest, and are dangerous to converse withal,
not so much in regard that any of the^ are able to do a chips worth of harm,
as of their willingness to do it if they were able. There are others, whom
the rest generally in dirision call by the name of Patriots, which is to say,
Patriots: these men desire an alteration in our country, but do not desire that
ye same should be done with the Spaniardes.
lovers and affecters of their Country. These in deed, among all the rest, are
men of the greatest temperance and best behavior, who, howsoever they are in
religion contrarilye affected, yet you shall never hear them speak
irreverently of her Majesty, neither truly do I think that in their hearts
they wish her any harm, at leastwise they are very respectious in bewraying
it either in word or action, I have heard some of them say, that so they
might be suffered to return into England, and to enjoy the liberty of their
conscience, they would be contented to be confined within the compass of a
poor cottage, and be bound never to come out of it while they lived.

But of all the rest, the fourth and last are the best fellows, for they fly
but a very low pitch, being men utterly void both of learning, wit, and
civility, these the rest esteem no otherwise of, Idiots and du^ce^.
than as of very dunses, not fit for any employment. The farthest drifte of
their religion is, to speak ill of the Queen, to say the Pope is a good man,
and to thumpe their breasts hard when they come to Church: I knew one of them
that having sometimes been a petty merchant in England, sold all that ever
he had, and putting two hundred pounds in his purse, went to Jerusalem to
buy a pound of wax candles, which he brought home upon his back, and withal
as much earth of the mount Oliuet as he was able to carry: imagining that
every dram thereof was able to cast out a legion of devils. In regard of which
relics, upon his return to Brussels, he obtained a pension, where he
still remains: and truly he may be a good man, for I think he lives in
as great poverty as ever did any of the Apostles, though perchance not so
voluntary, but the best is, he will not give his best friend the least mite of
his holy things, saying that he reserueth them to furnish the Churches in
England, when they shall come one day to be Catholic, and has already
appointed what Churches they be that he means to make beholding unto him for
this high benefit.

I would have named the particular names of every one according to the
factions to which they are affected, but that I fear this last remembered sort
would have been angry with me, and withal, there is another respect or two
besides: but above all these, there is one ouer-ruling faction, that has
drawn them into mighty partialities and strange extremities one against
another. The original whereof sprung out of the Romish Seminary between the
English and the Welsh: either party had for favorer and protector a man of
great authority, to which leaned Doctor Allen for the one, and Doctor Jews
for the other, a man very wise and learned, Contention between D: Lews and D:
Allen
and by reason of his age, gravity, and long continuance in those parts, of
great authority in the court of Rome, and since in the later end of Pope
Gregory, created Bishop of Casano in Naples, but always a very bitter enemy
to the Jesuits. In fine, each nation with all vehemency labored for the
presidentship and superiority one over the other. The Welchmen pretended the
first foundation of the College to have bin by a British king, for the
perpetual behoof of his Countrymen. The Englishmen likewise alleging their
reasons: but in the end do what they could, they were by the Welchmen caused
to avoid the house. Whereupon (with their fardles upon their necks, as being
ready to depart the town) they presented themselves unto Pope Gregory, whom
with a lamentable Oration they moved to take such compassion of them, that he
caused them to return, taking (to theirfull contentment) order between the^
and their adversaries. Notwithstanding which reconciliation, there still
remained a great hart-burning and dislike. Shortly after Pope Sixtus
determining to make a Cardianall of our Nation, Co^petencie between D: Lews and
D: Allen for ye Cardinalship
there grew for the same great competency between Doctor Jews and Doctor
Allen, each one for the obtaining thereof applying his best friends to the
uttermost. But in the end thorough the instant pursuit of the Jesuits, who
spared no travel nor expense, they procured unto D. Allen such mighty friends,
that the lot and pre-eminence of this dignity fell upon him, of whom, and of
the Jesuits, and of their faction, were for ever mortally hated, all those
that had bin any way favorers or well-willers to D. Jews: but chiefly and
among the rest one Thomas Morgan, Morgan hated of the Jesuits
a man not inferior to any of them all in driftes of policy, who had bin
sometimes secretorie to the Scottish Queen, and in deed had instantly labored
in the behalf of D. Jews. The Jesuits since have had many a pluck at him,
but Morgan being wise, strengthened himself always with such friends, that
they could never do him any hurt, but rather ever now and then he gave them a
secret blow: he drew wholly unto his faction the L. Paget, the Bishop of
Dunglane, a Scotchman of great credit and gravity, C.Paget, T.Throckmorton,
Ralfe Liggons, and sundry other that esteem themselves to be of the better
sort. The names of those that held part with Morgan
Notwithstanding all which, so effectual and forcible were the means with
which they practiced against him, that they got him to be imprisoned in Paris,
laying to his charge that he was an intelligencer for sir Frances Walsingham,
a traitor to the service of the Queen his mistres, and from time to time a
discouerer of her practices, and withal procured the said queen to conceive
exceedingly ill of him, and taking the receivers ship of her dowry in France
from him, to bestow the same upon the Bishop of Rosse. Yet for all this Morgan
found such friends in the court of Rome, that by the Popes express
commandementes directed from time to time to his Nuntio then resident at Paris,
he was set at liberty, and thereupon began to make his iustifications to the
world, and withal bitterly to inueigh against his adversaries, and the wrongs
which they had don him. Likewise at that instant there was a book printed in
Paris, publicly accusing the Jesuits of many wicked practices and most
malicious impieties, of which they suspected Morgan, and sure I think it was
his work, but they could never apparently prove it against him. Therefore
seeing that they had in this failed, they determined to take their revenge by
another course: to effect the which, they used as an instrument a young
Gentleman called Gage, whom by many pratises they suborned and incensed
thereunto: the manner whereof was as follows. Morgan being come down into
the low countries in company of the L. Paget, and his brother Charles, having
bin one night late at evening service in the Church of Saint Gudala at
Brussels, was as he came down the church stairs encountered in the dark by
Gage, Morgan wounded by Gage, suborned thereunto by the Jesuits
and by him grieously wounded in the face. Who thereupon presently fled,
thinking that he had slain him, but afterward by the means and earnest
pursuit of the L. Paget, was apprehended. The Jesuits and their party seemed
at the first stiffly to deny that they had bin the causers of this fact, but the
sequel of their proceedings made it most apparent to the whole world. For when
Morgan, the L. Paget, and diverse of his friends labored very earnestly and
with petitions unto the duke, to have the rigor and severity of justice to
proceed against him by whom this great violence was offered, they first labored
for reconciliation, which being flatly refused, Morgan accused by the Jesuits
of treason.
then to stop the plaintifes mouths, and to prevent such mischiefs as they
feared might ensue, they found no better means than once again to accuse
Morgan of treason, laying to his charge sundry points of treachery, as well in
former matters concerning the Scottish queen, as also the service and person of
the d.of Parma. Besides they accused him to have bin a setter on of Gilford and
his confederates, in such practices as they had undertaken by sir Frances
Walsinghams warrant and setting on, and to that end they sent Chriton the
Scottish Jesuit to Paris, to take Giffords examination, whose imprisonment
they had there procured: and withal, they caused all such as any way relied
upon them, to take their oath before the auditor general, that in their
conscience they though Morga^ to be a traitor and a spy: unto the taking of
which oath also they labored earnestly with sundry others, which (they not
having their conscience so saleable) refused and utterly denied to do: yet in
the mean time while these things were in hand, they wrought so with their
forged accusatio^s, that Morgan was clapped close prisoner in a miserable
dungeon, called the Truerenborche, where til the D. of Parmas death he
remained: at which time, as it is said, he was set at liberty, and lives now
with the Bishop of Cusano. Upon his apprehension there were above thirty
several ciphers found in his closet, in which, abroad in the world he
corresponded with great personages: and withal a Letter which he had newly
written to the Bishop of Dunglane, very defamatory against the person of the
D. of Parma: which incensed the Duke exceedingly against him, and was, without
doubt, the chiefest cause of his long imprisonment, for otherwise it is thought
he would easily have ouerpassed the calumniation of the Jesuits. In fine, these
two factio^s have sought to overthrow one another credit in the chiefest
courts of christe^dom, opening of either side such foul matters, and tossing
to and fro such filthy and slanderous defamations, that al men cry out
against them both, holding the^ to be traitors, and men of no fidelity. So
that undoubtedly I cannot but think him distracted of his wits, that having
means to lieu else where quietly, will make himself a party in these
partialities and contentions, which whosoever lives there must needs do, or
else like an enemy to them both be rusht like a ship between two tempests.

But the pretiest of all is, to see how smoothly they handle the matter with
you in England, abusing your simplicity with the subtlety of their words, and
the holiness of their, appearance. They make you and the other Catholics of
England believe, that what practices and drifts so ever they take in hand, are
all for the zeal of religion and advancement of the Catholic cause. And you
silly souls think all they say to be Gospel; whereas (God wot) religion is
the least matter of a thousand that they think upon. The only point they
aim at, being lost companions at home, The drifte of ye English traitors
abroad:
is to make themselves great where they are, and that by making you hazard your
lives, repuputations, and credits, and to that end they are always breeding
of practices and conspiracies, both within and without the realm, caring not
what success they take: if they prove well, then they will have the praise,
merit, honor, and reward thereof: if otherwise, then they say their good
will must be accepted, in great matters the attempt is sufficient. And
thereby they think to win the reputation to be accounted great state men, and
contriuers of weighty matters, not caring in the mean time for the security
of them by whom they work, as appears by the example and fall of many brave
gentlemen of England, whom by their treacherous practices they have brought to
ruin and destruction. They very well knew that when they first began to set
abroach the matter of Babbington and his disloiall confederats, that the
effecting thereof in such sort as they had plotted it, was altogether
impossible, Babington and his confederats.
as Mendoza the Spanish Ambassador, told Ballard the priest, their instrument
in contriuing the same, when he was at first in Paris brought unto him by
C.Paget, to desire him to inform the king his master of their intention, and
withal, that at a day appointed, there might be a force and assistance of men
ready to correspond with them. But that was al one, so they might be accounted
men of great reach, and dealers in such high state matters, they spared not to
proceed in enchanting those poor unexperienced young gentlemen, never leaving
till they had brought them to their ends, to the utter ruin of them and their
houses, in such sort as to the whole world is manifest, and needs not to be
recited.

Let therefore all the gentlemen of England, especially the Catholics, (who in
regard of their religion and credulity, are by them likeliest to be ensnared)
take heed and beware of having any thing to do with this pestilent and factious
race of people, for they speak so devoutly, look so smoothly, and write with
such counterfeted gravity and holiness, that it is hard for any man to eschew
their deadly baits, unless he do first know the falsehood and treachery under
which they do color and shroud them. What else has entangled M. Shelly in
these extreme calamities? M.Shelly
What likewise brought the late Earl of Northumberla^a, (who never before was
once detected of the least disloialtie toward his Prince or Country) into so
great troubles and distresses, The la^te Earl of Northumberland
and finally to so tragical and despairful an end, but only these outlandish
practices, and their conference with counterfeit Mope, Charles Paget*
who was sent out of France by this seditious troup, to the end to overthrow
both the one and the other?

What besides has bin the cause of bringing so many other Gentlemen to the
loss of their lives and liuinges, that lived before in ease, repose, and
security of conscience. And which is more, were not they the only contriuers
of the death of the Q. of Scotland, by setting her in continual practice one
upon another against the sacred person and royal estate of our most gracious
Soueraign, The Queen of Scotland
the Queens majesty, so that of violent necessity, her majesty, though
tardif, unwilling, and with great grief, at the general and instant petition
of all her most loving and faithful subjects (whose only weal and comfort
depends upon her long life and prosperity) to satisfy them, and to preserve
the estate of her noble and flourishing realm in quiet, was constrained to
secure the scepter in her own hands, by taking away the life of her that sought
to wrest it from her: though how much the noblenes of her mind was therewith
agrieued, the whole world that has known any thing of her proceedings
therein, either before or after, can be a witness. I say not this only of my
self, though I and all the world else do know it to be true, that these their
dealings have made the^ hateful and detestable even to those of their own
religion, insomuch that a French Jesuit terms them all in general, in a
book which he has written touching the Q. of Scotlands death, a viperous,
mischievous, and faithles kind of people, The censure of a French Jesuit
concerning the English Fugitives
treacherous to those they deal withal, disdainful, arrogant, ambitious, and
worthy to be extermined out of the utmost bounds of the world: besides many
such other goodly epithetes, with which he beutifies them in their colors: his
whole book being nothing but railing against English fugitives, wishing all
princes, noble men, and gentlemen whatsoever, to beware and take heed of them,
and that in such earnest, vehement, and inuectiue manner, that it is not
possible to be more.

And yet for all so many tragical ends of their bloody and traitorous
endeavors, are they moved with any the least spark of repentance. Neither
has the ruin of so many of you their countrymen, wrought and contrived by
their practice, allurement, and persuasion, bred in them any feeling of
remorse or conscience, but rather thereby animated and encouraged to set new
conspiracies and treasons abroach, with meaning in deed by sowing seditions
among you, and by opposing you against the state, to make you the only
instruments one of the others ruin, and so to make the way open to the Spanish
tyrant. I will not speak any thing of their infinite former practices, as well in
Ireland as within this realm, against the person of her majesty, the quietness
of either country, wherein still their instruments have by violent ends miserably
perished: which desolatio^s procured by their only practice (but that they are
utterly void of all christian humanity) might have served to persuade them,
that God is not pleased with their action, or at least the bloody quarters of
so many Gentlemen as the swoorde of justice from time to time, (constrained by
their horrible atte^pts) has divided and dispersed about the walls and turrets
of London, and other places in this Realm, might have stricken a terror into
their minds, never more to hazard the lives of their countryme^, in so wicked
and tragical an enterprise. But no whit at all are their uncharitable and
stony hearts herewith touched, but rather still incensed more and more to
practice the desolation of this noble realm, and the death of our most dear
and dreaded Soueraign, no whit at all regarding the greatness of her majesty,
the same being of all other nations had in such regard and reverence, nor the
tenderness of her sex, which even amongst the most barbarous nations, has bin
alwais a safeguard against violence: nor lastly the shining brightness of her
virtue, which has moved ye remotest regions of the world to admire her, and
the greatest princes living, some by themselue^, some by their ambassadors, to
offer herall honor, service, and reverence.

All this notwithstanding, these men, according to the confession of their
instruments lately executed, keep a solemn council table, Holt the Jesuit
chief president of this damnable crew.
wherein nothing is handled but new and daily practices for the shortning of
her Majesty's most glorious life, though they see how miraculously God blesses
and defends her, and that as the giants which did shoot against heaven, The
obstinacy of the English traitors
they are still wounded with the fall of their own arrows.

What followed of their late practice with that worthy and honorable gentleman,
Ferdinando late Earl of Darby, but only that it brought poor Heskits, their
instrument for execution thereof, Heskits sent by the^ to practice with
Ferdina^do Earl of Darby
to the gallows, who bitterly with tears bewailed their acquaintance, and
naming sir William Stanley and others, cursed the time that he ever had known
any of them?

But all had bin well, if his death only, or the death of a thousand more such
traitors, had concluded the tragedy, so that the noble Earl had not likewise
with his fall given all England cause to cry out upon them, for when they had
once fully discovered the loyalty of his affection toward her Majesty, and
the hatred that he bare to them and their faction, either of which he well
testified by the apprehension of Heskits, he came shortly afterward to the
end of his life, whether by their practice or no, God knows, and time will
discover. But that so it was (the circumstance of the matter, and the accidents
of his sickness considered) there is nothing more likely.

Having herein failed, presently they set new instruments aworke, as Cullen
the Irishman, York, and Williams, promising great rewards, Cullen, York, and
Williams.
and giving the^ instructions how they should behave themselves upon the
landing, for the better accomplishing thereof, but the end was, that after
having confessed all the circumstances of this hateful act, and the names and
means of them that labored them thereunto, and cursed the authors and
contriuers of the horrible treason by them intended, they ended their lives at
Tiborne, and their quarrters were dispersed about the gates of London. But some
may perchance demand of me what their meaning herein may be, or what credit,
commodity, or gain might have allured them to enter in these beforesayd so
wicked and detestable inclinations. For answer hereunto: first I told you that
so they might be accounted and reputed for great state-men, high spirited, and
of deep action, to procure that reputation and credit, they care not whose
estate of life they endanger. But besides this also which we have already
spoken of, they have also farther meanings and driftes, Another drifte of the
English fugitives.
as those that do look deepliest and with greatest heedfulnes into their
actions do verily imagine, having by sundry their proceedinges evidently
discoured the same: of which the chiefest is, that as they are of all people
living the most ambitious, so seeing this beggarly service does not fit their
humors, they do feed themselves with an imagination of the time to come, I mean
a Spanish or Romish world in our Country, at which time the doubt not the long
time of their exile, sufferance, and loss of their livings considered (for so
is their phrase and manner of speech) to become mighty and great men, and to
have principal dignity, swaie, and authority in our country. Marie again
on the otherside, considering that the most part of them are but base defamed
companions, of no birth or living, and that there are in England many Gentlemen
of the same religion of great quality and houses, that would disdain to have
such mates preferred before them in quality or degree. They have gone by all
means possible they can, about with their practices and colorable devises to
root them out, so serving their onwe turns two ways: the one to win unto
themselves the name and reputation of men of service, the other to rid out of
the way those that they imagine would stand in competencie with the^, but (God
be thanked) the chifest harm their conspiracies have done hitherto, has bin to
perish in their own devises. Spies sent by them into England
A little before the coming of the Spanish fleet, they sent their espials, and
among them some that were priests, in disguised garments, with instructions to
sound the meaning of such Gentlemen as they thought to be favorers of their
religion, and to incline their minds to the Spanish cause, encouraging them to
take arms against her majesty: to which they printed in the English tongue many
hu^dreds of books in Antwarp, barreling them up until such time as the army
should have bin landed, Seditious books printed in Antwarpe.
and then their meaning was to have dispersed them, expryssing therein many
great promises and large rewards to such as should assist or do any manner of
service to the Catholic party, terrifying the rest with bitter menaces. In
fine, the whole being full of traitorous and proud threatening speeches, as well
against her majesty, as against all such her faithful subjects as should have
taken her part. Likewise they obtained of the Pope and the king, that as many
as had their voices in the parliament house at such time as the queen of
Scotland was adjudged to die, of what degree soever they were, should be
deprived not only of their lives and livings, but that their posterity also
should be for ever disinherited and disnobled. The like also they threatened in
their books, to all such, as well noble men as others, that should after the
landing of the catholic army persist in arms against the same. But all this
by the goodness of God, has but served to discover their wicked intentio^s,
and to animate all true Englishmen to persist with the greater love, unity,
and courage in obedience to her majesty.

Turning therefore my speeches to you, O unnatural and degenerated Englismen,
to those whom you should obey treacherous and unfaithful, and of those that you
do obey, contemned and made slaves: How can you endure to thirst after the
destruction of so sweet a country, in which you received your being, and that
gave you nouriture when you were young? Why do you abuse religion, in making the
same a mask to your intended treasons? How can you find in your hearts to seek
the destruction of so benign a prince, and the subversion of so glorious an
estate, by bringing into the bowels thereof the barbarous arms of so insole^t
an enemy, who where he is victorious, staineth the earth with blood, the air
with blasphemy, and the heavens with his abominable and luxurious
incontine^cies, let Flanders, Portugal, Hispaniola, and the other princes of
India be witness. The old worthy Romans thought it the most heroical thing that
might be, to vow themselves sometimes to death for their country, The two
Decij. Tit. Liu.
and even to spend their lives in defense of their altars, temples, and
monuments of their elders: but you seek to see your country bathing in the
blood of your parents, kindred, and friends, to see your cities, graves, and
temples of your predecessors consumed with fire, to see your virgins defloured,
your women ravished, and finally to bring the noblest of nations to a
perpetual slavery and servitude, yea, and that of the most cruel nation that
lives, a nation not fully an hundred years since wholly they received
christianity, and as yet are in their hearts Pagans and Moors, from profession
of which they are only restrained by the severe bridle of their cruel and
sanquinary inquisitio^: which paganism of theirs, though in their speeches they
dare not manifest, yet do they in their abominations discover the same. If the
Numantines, Saguntines, and Nessatians burnt their towns, slew their wives and
children, and finally themselves, rather than they would receive the yoke of
worthy and virtuous nations that assailed them. What should we then do, who^
our virtuous ancestors have left honored with the invincible trophes of so many
victories over great and mighty nations, yea over Spanie it self, rather than
to endure the insolent, wicked, and tiranous government of that nation, whom al
Europe has in horror, leaving to our posterity after us a perpetual
servitude and bondage, as an everlasting memory of our cowardice.

But leaving this until a fitter time, I hope that his already said shall be
sufficient to make you clearly and plainly understand, that there is not to be
found among these disentions, partialities, conspiracies and treasons, that
sweetness, liberty, and tranquillity of conscience which you expect and look
for, but rather turmoile, grief, and distraction of mind, with a perpetual
grudging and remorse of conscience, scandalized with infinite examples of evil
life, impiety, defamation, and perjury, on the one side offensive to her
Majesty and the state of your country, and on the other side subjected to the
disdain and bitter scorn of the Spaniard, The Spaniarde esteems ye service,
but scorneth the traitor
who howsoever he respect the service, yet never regard the person of a
traitor, as a great noble man in Spain spared not to tell Charles the fifth,
when by him he was commanded to lodge the Duke of Burbon in his house at
Madryle, saying that he would willingly obey his Majesty, The answer of a
noble man to Charles the fifth
but protesting withal by a great oath, that he would set it a fire so soon as
the Duke should be out of it, for his predecessors had not built it to be an
harbor for traitors. Likewise when Christian var de Veque had betrayed, The
kings reco^pe^ce to Christian var de Veque, for betraying to him the castle of
S. John's in Portugal
for a promised great pension, the castle of S.John, being one of the most
important fortresses for Portugal, to this k. Phillip that now is: how and with
what reward was he honored? Even truly with such as a traitor deserves, for
being entertained a while with hope, till such time as the king saw himself
absolute master of all, he was then for his pains banished, and confined to
the wars of Africa for ten years. The like usage in a manner, received all his
fellows that had betrayed their lawful king, by delivering such places as they
held in government, or by doing the king of Spain any other service to the
prejudice of Don Antonio. Who when they came afterward to demand recompense,
were answered that the king did not use to buy that which was his own, and
therefore wished them to take heed how they mentioned any such matter, least
thereby they came to be called further into question.

Not much more pleasing was the speech that sir W.Stanley received from
Verdugo, The speech of Verdugo to sir W:Stanley
who hearing him one day with passion transported into violent speeches against
his country, wished him to use moderation, for though he had offended his
country, his country never offended him.

Likewise R.York at dinner one day with Count Charles of Mansfet, at his house
in Brussels, Count Charles of Mansfet to R:York
beginning to use unbeseeming speeches of her Majesty, was commanded by the
Count to hold his peace, praying him thence forward to be better acquainted
with the customs of his table, which did not give any man privilege to
speak irreverently of Princes. So that (as I said) there is nothing more
apparent than the scornful account the Spaniard makes of our persons,
howsoever for his own purpose he imbraceth our services. Two Semin^aries
erected by ye king in Spain, one at Valladolid, the other at Ciuil^ and two in
the low countries, the one at Doway and the other at Saint Homars.
But perchance some of you will say, it is not your intentions to serve him in
his wars, or to meddle with any matter of estate, but whereas he has now
charitably and liberally erected four Seminaries for the behoof of English
students, there quietly to pass your time, and to apply your book in one of
them, not coming among these contentious fellows I speak of, nor so much as
once to think of them. I do not much mislike the simple sincerenes of your
intention, but yet if I might counsel you, I would wish you to look a little
better into the matter, before you engage your self in any such course. Wise
men are not carried away with the appearance of things, but in matters that are
doubtful, do always suspect the worst. The worst wine has always the
fairest Iuy bush: the foulest serpe^ts lie under the best and rankest grass:
and the birds that fly unto the bait without regarding the lime twigs, are
easiliest entangled. The Trojans seeing the fair and fertile fields of
Sicilia, bended their oars thither, but Alchimedes cried unto the^ to lanch
away, for Poliphemus was there. Undoubtedly the love and zeal which the king
seems to bear unto those of our nation is great, in inuiting them to study
in his countries, and to that end preparing such convenient places for them.
But I have often heard say, that the fauning flatteries of an enemy are far

Ioab killed Abner when he embraced him, and the Syrensings when she allures to

the songs of a Siren, or to the kisses of an enemy, under which he shadoweth
the deep and deadly mischief that he intends to our nation, and to none
deardlier than to those that embrace his offers, such I mean as do plant
themselves in his new erected colleges, of which (if we were not altogether
blinded, or rather cruelly bewitched with some magical sorcery) the proofs are
to apparent. For if it be for their good he allureth the^ thither, why then (if

capable of? Oh no, there is no such matter, he has other ways in which he
must employ them, which are such as he well knows cannot cost them less than
their lives, which though he shadow under other prete^ces, yet when I have
declared the order thereof, I will leave the reader to judge of as it shall
please him, for my part I conceive as I have written. First, whosoever comes
to apply his time in study in any of these Seminaries, must promise to take
upon him the orders of Priesthood, when he shall be called upon so to do, for I
assure my self that the same rules are observed in his two Seminaries of
Spain, as were at that of Doway and Rhemes, which were by his pensions there
maintained. Likewise he must solemnly make a vow of obedience to his superior,
directly and without any contradiction, to go whether soever he shall send him,
and to govern himself according to such instructions as he shall receive from
him, and from the same not to swerve, though it should cost him his life. This
superior is alwais one that absolutely depends of the k.of Spain, as did
cardinal Allen and Parsons, who being absolutely at his commandment, and so by
consequence also are all the inferiors, of which as any growth to greater
perfection than his fellows, so is he soonest chosen out to be sent in to
England, there to parturbe the quiet of the realm, to sow sedition, to
practice reuolts, and to alienate the mind of the subjects from obedience to
her majesty, thereby to prepare a bridge for him, whereby he might make his
enterie into the realm, in which action the poor instrument is assured still
to perish: of which we have seen but too many examples, and I would to God we
might never see more. But that our Countrymen whom God has blessed with such
excellent gifts of learning and eloquence as sundry of them, would, if not
turn the same to the service of their Prince and Country, and the comfort of
their friend, yet at least not suffer themselves to the drawn into such
violent courses against it, wherein they see God prospers them not, justice
confounde^th them, and finally howsoever they be there canonized for marti^s,
our Chronicles, and all the stories of our time, will for ever, to the shame of
their stock and parentage, record them fortraitors.

Here now you see the drifte of the king of Spain in erecting these his
Seminaries, and to what end he allureth you over, assuring himself, that so
long as he can with his fair shows draw any of you thither, he shall never
want instruments to sow sedition in our Country, and to take upon them the
execution of whatsoever his mischievous endeavors. Fly therefore from the
enchanted snares, you that will not be transformed into monsters. Those that
beheld the head of Medusa were only turned into stones, but these that are
insorcered with these Spanish enchantments, are transformed into shapes much
more horrible and monstrous: their hearts are alienated from their prince and
country, their hands made instruments to write hateful slanders, and
defamatorie libels against persons of great nobility and honor, yea and
sometimes to hold a dagger wherewith to murder the Lords anointed, their
tongues into trumpets, to arm men to rebellion, bloodshed, and wars, and
finally, whereas every age has held it, according to the saying of the Poet,
Decorum mori pro patria, to be a comely thing to die for ones Country. The
Spanish disse^bled frindship intends greater mischief unto us, than ever did
the hatred of any other nation
Their lives (with such fury are they possessed) are upon every Spanish
commandment, ready to be offered up against the same as a sacrifice.

And this assure your self, that this dissembled Spanish friendship intends
greater mischief unto us, than ever did the apparent hatred of any nation else
whatsoever.

Be wise therefore in time, and come not within the fatal enterie of this
dedalian labirinth, out of which only Theseus by good hap escaped, all the rest
that ever entered, were devoured by the minotaure. The Italyans have a saying,
which me thinks may very well be applied to our nation, for such Spaniardes as
the king sends to the wars of Flaunders, because they are needy bare
wretches, at the first taking up, he sends them to his garrisons of Naples
and Mylain, there to be hartned and fashioned a year or two, and then sending
a new supply of the like into their places, he passes them away into
Flaunders: and after when they are consumed, for commonly they hold not above
a year or two, then he supplieth them with his Italyan garrisons, and so
successsiuely seconds still one with an other, To make them fat in Italy, to
kill the^ in Flanders.
whereupon the Italyans have a proverb: In Italia gli ingrassano, in
Fiandragli amassanos. Which surely can be better applied to none then to our
fugitives, whom he keeps to no other end then to send to the slaughter. I
could urge this point farther, confirming it with infinite proofs and examples,
but that this already spoken may suffice to let you know the danger of
putting your self into this Spanishe coope, which whosoever knows, and yet
will go thither, it is greatly to be feared, what innocence so ever he
pretend, that he bears with him the mind of a traitor.

Now to the third point of my discourse, concerning the mislike which sundry
of you have of her majesty's government, and the state of our country at this
present, pretending that to be the cause why ye transport your selves into the
king of Spaines dominions, who in your conceit, are governed with much more
mildness and tranquillity: I will by comparing the one with the other, as
near as I can, let you see the difference between them both, and so
consequently your own error.

As near as I can guess, this your disliking proceeds of two points, The
causes of their dislykyng the government,
the one that your laws are too rigorously and severely executed against such
as profess the Catholic religion: the other, that the adversary has buzzed
a fear into your heads, making you believe that the forces of our state are
too feeble to resist so mighty and puissant an enemy as the Spanish king:
whose mighty treasures, many dominions, and armies of men, they magnify to the
skies, and therefore perchance you covet to join betimes with that party which
you do think aduantagious, for your future security and advancement. First
touching the persecution of Catholics, which our fugitives do so much
exclaim upon, filling whole volumes therewith, and aggravating the same in
terms most bitter and lamentable, to foreign nations: let us see what reason
they have. I would feign demand one question, If ever they did read, hear, or
know of any one king or queen, that did with greater mildnes or lenity
tolerate or suffor within his or their dominion, a sect of religion opposite
to the laws by him or the^ established, especially the same having sundry
times made rebellious attempts against their crown, estate, and dignity.

Let them look, if they be men of judgment, into the ages passed, even
amongst the Heathens, and into the present time among al ye princes of Europe,
whether there be any to be found that has dealt with the like lenity as her
majesty has done. Why then do they so falsely slander her? Do they not know
that she is their sacred and anointed Queen, appointed by God to rule over
them? If they do, why do not they then with all reverence and humility, love,
honor, and obey her, praying God to convert her, (seeing such is their desire)
and not by traitorous endeavor seek to murder and deprive her. They learned
not that of the ancient Christians, in the Primitive Church, who prayed for the
Emperors and Princes under whom they lived, yea, and though they were
idolaters and heretics, beseeching God that it would please him to grant them
Vitam prolixam, The fathers of ye primitive church prayed unto God for their
prince, yea, even such as persecuted the^, yt it would please him to give the^
alo^g life, a secure Empire, their house safe, their armies strong, their
Counsel faithful, their people true, and finally, a peaceble world
imperium securum, domum tutam, exercitus fortes, senatum fidelem,
populumprobum, orbem denig quietum.

Now let our fugitives examine the secret of their own consciences, and I
doubt not but their shall find them guilty of another manner of mattins.

But they will say, she has executed many Seminary Priests, I confess in
deed that the law has had his course with many of them, as likewise it has
had with many other malefactors for their crimes. But yet her majesty has
always proceeded therein in so gracious and merciful a sort, that she has
witnessed sufficiently to the world, how loath she is to come unto blood, so
long as there was any other remedy to be used.

For her Majesty knows, her honorable Council knows, yea, and I and the
whole world knows, that the coming of these Seminaries, Priests, and
Jesuits, to reconcile men (as they term it) to the obedience of the Roman
church, is directly and absolutely to alienate and divert their minds from her
majesty, and to incline them to be ready to assist any enemy either within
or without the realm, that shall color his cause under the pretext of
religion. Her majesty, I say, and counsel, and all good subjects knowing this,
and foreseeing the danger that might thereof ensue, forbad by act of
Parliament, these sorts of seditious people to enter into her realm, or to
use or exercise any such unquiet doctrine. Limiting therewithal to such as
were within the realm, a time to depart out of the same.

But this lenity wrought rather contempt then obedience, for these men
contemning the gravity of our laws, and not thinking any to be obeyed, but
such as they make themselves, came still into the realm as fast as before.
Great numbers of them were taken and emprisoned, whom though her majesty
deservedly, and with great Justice, (especially the daily mischief stirred up
within the realm, by their malicious practices considered) might have executed
as Traitors and Rebels, yet the greatenesse of her princely clemency and
compassion, was so unwilling to come unto extremes, that she caused them al
once more to be pardoned, and to be put out of the realm but with express
commandment, never to return in the like sort: in doing otherwise, they
should not attend any other than the rigor of the laws. All this would not
serve their turn, but in despite of her majesty, and contempt of her laws,
sundry of them returned, of which some of them being taken, have received the
hyre and just recompense of their disobedience.

But that her majesty seeks not their blood, as they most falsely give out,
appears by her clemency used to sundry of them, taken by her soldiers in
the Low Countries, who though they were of Sir William Stanlyes crew and
adhaerentes, yet seeing they were not taken within England, she graciously
pardoned them all, and caused them to be set at liberty, in giving some
little recompense to those that had taken them prisoners.

Where is then this rigor you speak of? I hope the king of Spain keeps
another manners of revel in his dominions, The cruelty and persecutions of the
Spaniard in matters of Conscience.
over all Spain, Portingall, Lombardie, Naples, and Sicilia: whosoever
speaks a word, or makes the least sign in the world to mislike his
religion there established, or any point or ceremony thereof, his cruel and
bloody ministers, the Inquisitors, cause the^ without remission to be
presently burnt alive: of which the death of poor Doctor Augustine Cacalla
can give good witness. Who for a small point in difference of religion, was at
Valladolid in Spain apprehended for a Lutheran, and with him thirty, of such
as had given him audience: many of which were Gentlemen and Ladies, and among
the rest the two sons of the Marquess of Poza, the greatest part of which
were presentlye burnt alive, the rest submitting themselves, were pardoned
their lives, but condemned to perpetual prison, with the confiscation of all
their goods: and all their life time to wear the Sambenito, which is a yeolow
garment, The Sambenito
with a red cross before and another behind, painted all over full of devils
faces: a thing of the greatest reproach and dishonor there that possibly can
be.

But seeing these, of which we have spoken, are his subjects, and are of
force tied to the jurisdiction of his law, how cruel so ever, I will not
here trouble you any farther with the recital of the calamities and miseries
laid upon them from time to time, how sundry of them for the breach of his
constitutions in matter of ceremony, have bin cruelly committed to the flames.
But what reason has he, I would feign know, to extend the like rigor and
cruelty against strangers, who owe him no obedience, but come only into his
Country in regard of machandise, or other their occasions, and nevertheless
have been apprehended, their goods taken away, and their themselves cruelly
executed.

Among innumerable other examples hereof that I could allege, I will only
acquaint you with one. At execution of which, a Gentleman of good credit in
the low Countries, swear unto me that he was present, and that it was in
manner as follows.

There was one Giles Rat, a Citizen of Antwarpe, The execution of a Dutchman
and an Englishman in Spain for religion
and by his occupation a shoemaker, who some few years since going into
Spain about some business pertaining to his trade, was apprehended and
brought before the inquisitors, only for that he had smiled at the image of
our Lady, which as they said he had done in derision, and therefore presently
condemned him to the fire, amd with him likewise an Englishman for the like
cause, whose name the Gentleman that saw them burned, knew not: but he told
me, that at the time of their execution there mounted up into a scaffolde
there by two Jesuits, forbidding the peoto, upon pain of excommunication, to
pray for them, saying that they had delivered them both over inbodie and soul
to the devil, as those that died obstnate and wilful heretics.

Surely by these examples it appears, that he would be loath to tolerate in
Spain any that should go about to seduce his people with any contrary
doctrine, especially ministers, of which if any such should fall into his
hands, it is likely he would not so often pardon them as the Queen has done
the other. As for his low Countries, They were taken in the town of Dermounde
three years since
I never knew but of two taken, and they were both put in sackes by the
Spaniards, and thrown into the river.

This is in deed extreme tyranny, and not that which her majesty uses, who
is always ready to receive into grace and favor, those of whom she has
any hope that they will become good subjects, The merciful offer of her
majesty to Catholics after their condemnation.
and has, as I have heard, offered (after that by law they were condemned)
her princely mercy and favor to some of them, if they would have promised to
become good subject.

O how different is this proceeding from that, whose mildness and clemency
they so highly commend! But it is the nature of men, especially of those whose
judgments are wavering and unsettled, always to mislike and loath those
things to which they are accustomed, deeming other, to them unknown, much
better.

But perchance you will say that in their so great commendation, they do
only mean his manner of government in the Low Countries. True in deed it
is, that he has not yet planted there his inquisitio^, though the same be
much against his will. Nevertheless if you did but see the manner of his
government in those parts, I think you would judge them worthy of small
belief, that have so highly commended the same unto you. First, in matter of
religion and conscience, I do not think that it is possible for any people
be more hardly any uncharitably dealt withal, then they are under the
servitude of the clergy, but especially of the Jesuits.

As for the other orders of religion, as Monks, Friars, etc. though they are
exceedingly exhausted by them in matter of charge, as being compelled to
reedifie their ruined cloisters, to furnish them with costly images and rich
furnitures, and daily to supply their wants, as well in yielding them
victuals, as in satisfying all their other exorbitant demandes, which are
infinite, (of which who so denies any, is presently reputed to be an heretik)
Yet all this is nothing in comparion of that which by the Jesuits they are
constrained to endure, The Jesuits grown to an exceeding authority in the
Low Countries.
who have now gotten that hand over them, that the chief magistratships and
places of dignity, are not granted but unto such as shall be by their liking
allowed, and by their authority confirmed. Neither without their advice and
council dare they determine of any great matter, concerning either government
or policy. There is not any man's business but they must have an oar in it:
The greatness magnificence, and the deliciousness of the Jesuits
they never plant themselves in any places but in the midst of goodly
cities, where they wring themselves into the fairest palaces, in some of them
dispossessing by violence those to whom they appertained. Their college at
Antwarp belongs to the society of the merchants of Aquisgrane, who^ they
have excluded. Likewise their college at Brussels, is usurped and detained
from the true heirs
Their churches are rich and sumptuous, their moueables and householde stuff
magnificent, rather than decent, their gardens pleasant, spacious, and
delightful, their garments fine and comely, their fare plentiful and of the
best: and in fine, they are not tied to any risings in the night, or any the
like hardness, to which other religious orders are subjected. Their first mass
does never at any time begin before eight of the clock, unto the which you
shall see him come (...) attended on with nouices, in as great a gravity as the
Pope himself when he is in all his pontificalibus: The politic institution
of ye Jesuits,
they are accounted to be the greatest intelligencers and state-men of the
world. They may not according to their orders, receive any higher officer or
dignity: wherein of all other things they have the greatest policy, for
otherwise their old politicians should be from them advanced to higher
promotions, which would be great diminution to their dignity, which as they
now order the matter, is of such credit and reputation, that they take the
name of a Jesuit, not to be any whit inferior to the title of a Bishop,
they are not subject to any ordinary, nor to the controlment of any Bishop
or Legate whatsoever, but only to the prouincial or general of their order,
who never lightly comes amongst them, and if he do, he is a brother of the
society, and will find no faults for fear of scandal.

But the best is, to see how busy and diligent they are when they hear of a
wealthy man that lies sick and in danger of death. They bestir themselves
when they hear of a rich man that lies in danger of death.
This is their chiefest harvest and most Opimapraeda. Then they commend unto
him the poverty of their College, and the merit that he shall gain by
dealing liberally with them, as being for ever to be remembered in their
masses, as one of their benefactors. The Cordeliers and they are at this
present in process together in Spain, about this visitation of sick men in
articulo mortis. The Cordeliers are such as in England we called Gray friars,
of the order of Saint Frances.
The Jesuits say, that it appertains unto them, because their profession is
active, and to be always stirring among the flock, and to do good to the
world abroad: whereas that of the Cordeliers is contemplative, and so by
consequence most decent, that they should contain themselves within their
cloisters. The Cordeliers on the other side do reply that their profession is
meekness, innocence, poverty, and to do good unto all men. As for the
Jesuits, that they are proud, ambitious, aspiring, entermedlers in matters of
state: Men of great riches and covetous of more, and therefore by no means to
be admitted to such as lie at the point of death. The Jesuits have been
inueighed against in the public schools of the university of Louaine.
The matter has been much argued of and greatly debated in Spain. All the
other Doctors of religion are vehemently against them, and they have been
openly inueiged against in the public schools of Louaine: yet notwithstanding
they are so strongly backed by the king (whose turn they serve again in other
matters) that howsoever the cry go against them, they hold their own still.

The policy of the Jesuits in teaching of children.
Among all their other policies, they have one, that in my judgment is no whit
at all inferior to any of the rest. For wheresoever they remain, they take
upon them to teach and instruct the children of chief men and magistrates,
professing to do the same freely and without reward: wherein they deal so
carefully, that the parents do not account their childrens time misspent: they
in the mean time making hereof a double benefit. For first they bind the
fathers and parents of their children to be their friends and favorers:
secondly, as for the scholars, they strike into their tender capacities such a
reverence of themselves, and withal do distill into their minds such points
of doctrine, and such an opinion of their holiness and integrity, that the
same seldom wears away, but rather increases with their years, which is
undoubtedly of no small moment, to the strengthening and the upholding of their
society and faction. Likewise they have so cunningly wrought, that where soever
they are, they only are the general hearers of all confessions, diuing
thereby into the secrets and driftes of all men, acquainting themselves with
their humors and imperfections, and making thereof, as time and occasion
serves, their own use and benefit.

But by the way, seeing it comes so well to our purpose, I cannot choose but
tell you a pretty story that happened lately in the low Countries.

A story of the Jesuits impiety.
A merchant whose name was Hamyel, being sick at Antwarpe, of a consumption or
fever, Ethicke the Jesuit knowing him to be a man of great possessions, and
without children, presently repaired unto him, under color of spiritual
consolation, laying before him the vanity of this life, and the glory of the
world to come: With sundry other persuasions, as of all men living they have
their tongues most at will: and withal, commending unto him their order, as of
all other the most meritorious, perfect, and acceptable to God, and to which
our holy Father the Pope and his predecessors have granted more indulgences
than to any other order of religion whatsoever: insomuch that they brought the
poor man (being of himself simple) into such a fools paradise, that he
professed himself into their society, thinking that there was no other way
to be saved: So as before hand he infeoffed their college with his land,
which was two hundred pou^ds a year, giving the^ much goods and rich moueables,
and when he had so done, died within three months after the same. His next
heirs, by counsel of their friends, put the Jesuits in suit. Against which
though they opposed themselves with all vehemency, yet to their great shame
and reprehension, sentence was given against them by the roial council of
Macklin. It is called Magnum, regium, consilium, and has authority to
determine definitly both in civil and criminal causes without appeal.
Notwithstanding they would not so give over, but by the means, aid, and
support of President Pamele, a chief favorite of theirs, they appealed from
thence to the council of Estate at Brussels, getting the cause, after sentence
given, to be removed, a thing there unusual, and scarcely ever heard of
before. There I left the process hanging, what became of it afterward I know
not, but by hook or by crook it was thought they would carry it away in
the end.

Another time a rich and wealthy merchant of Antwarp, An other ye like
history.
but one in that point whose devotion and scrupulotitie ouer-went his wisdom,
coming to them in confession, and telling them of some unjust gain, with
which he felt his conscience touched, they presently (with sundry terrifying
speeches) told him that he was in the state of damnation, out of which he
could not be delivered until such time as he had made restitution, as well of
that confessed, as of all other money and goods, that he had by usury
unlawfully gotten: laying before him, Quod non dimittitur peccatum nisi
restituatur ablatum, with sundry other such sentences, of which they had store.
In fine, they put the poor man into such a sear of conscience, that he
yielded to make restitution, if so the same might be done without his
undoing, discredit, or shame* Whereupon to comfort him again, but in deed
fearing least if they dealte too rigorously and roughlye with him, they should
get nothing, they told him that if in steed of all such interests and vsuries,
with which he felt his conscience burdened, he only would be content to
deliver unto them some such sum of money, as without his undoing, he thought
he might conveniently spare, His name is John Baptista Spinila, a man known in
most marcha^t towns of christeodom.
they would take it upon their souls to see the sum employed upon good,
virtuous, and charitable uses, to the greater benefit and merit of his soul,
and as a thing more acceptable unto God and less scandalous to the world, then
if he should make restitution to whom it apperteined, and had been by his
usury interessed: where upon the merchant being well satisfied in conscience,
gave them the money, and they him their absolution. It was a great speech for a
while about the town, that this great merchant would become a Capuchine and
make a distribution of his goods among them: he himself made great show
thereof a while, but it the end he deceived them, and falling to his old byas,
did not stick to tell unto some of his private friends this fore remembered tale.

But I will hold you no longer with the recital of these their politic and
unconscionable practices, which truly, in my opinion, are very unfitting for
men that profess themselves to be of the society of Jesus, who being the
fountain of all pureness, will surely never associate himself with
deceivers, and false wordly politicians. But let them take heed: for this the
intrusion of themselves into temporal matters, their subtilties and unquiet
stirring wits has made them odious to most part of the world: I mean even
to such as profess their own religion. The templers were as mighty as ever
they were, and in outward appearance of great holiness and integrity, yet for
their hypocricie God sodeinly overthrew them, The Templers greater than ever
they were, yet suddenly for their hypocrisy overthrown.
took away their lives and possessions, and made their memory infamous. Let
them beware, that the like punishment hang not over their heads, for I can
assure them they are grown odious to the world, and to none more odious, then
to some of their own religion, who do well forsee the scandal and slander that
by their behavior arises to the Roman Church. I could here in particular
touch some of the^ by name: with matters that they would be ashamed to here
of. But I am not so uncharitable or malicious as to libell the names of any
men, or to defame them publicly, especially for matters of frailty: though
among them, nothing is more common and usual, then upon the dislike of any
man's humor or action, presently to publish his name to the world, in some
malicious pamphlet or other: vpbraiding him therein, yea even with theverie
errors and frailties of his youth, if they can touch him with any such, if not
then imputing to him fained falsehoods and vilanies: which how false, wicked, or
improbable soever they be, they know they have customers that will receive
them for current. They have dared in their Libels to touch ye majesty of
princes, and the dignity of great and honorable cou^sellers.
Yet all were well, so they would content themselves to deal only with
private men in this sort. But such is their respectlesse, audatious, and
unbridled insolence, that they have dared to lift their damned and rebellious
pens, dipped in stronger poison than the arrows of Hercules, against the
sovereign and sacred majesty of Princes, and against the high and ancient
dignity of great and mighty counselors, yea even of such as sit at the helm
of government, taking out of the foulest sinkes of hell it self, false,
defematorie, perjured, and abominable speeches, thereby to dispossess the
worlds mind of the opinion, which their constant course in long continued
virtue and integrity has gained them. But in fine they loose their labor, and
get no more than he that defiled his own face with spitting into the wind: or
the other that kicking against a thorn, made his own heels bloody. For
howsoever in their commonwealth, which they deliniate according to the
guiltiness of their own feeling and government, or their Philopater, which
name they give themselves by a figure called Antiphrasis: But howsoever in them
or any other pamphlet they rail or bewraie their own malice, they can no
whit at all impeach the honor and reputation of these noble personages, who
like mighty and well grounded rocks, contemning the forcelesse winds that
blow against them, are so surely seated upon the safe ground of loyalty to
their Prince, and love to their Country, that albeit they please the humor of
a few, whom they lead like Buphals by the noses, forbidding them to look into
the light, least they should perceive their iugling: yet those that have any
wisdom or discourse of reason, will the more reverence, honor, and esteem
them, and admire their happiness in having deserved so well of the realm, as
that thereby they should procure unto them the hatred of those that are such
deadly and desperate enemies to the state, and safety of the same. And as for
some of the^, no succeeding age can ever be so unthankful, as not for ever to
remember their names with an infinitenes of honor.

But in the mean time, judge with your selves how miserable and enthralled
these people must of necessity be in matter of conscience, The miserable
wretchedness and calamity of the Low Countries under ye government of the
Spaniards.
whose leaders religion is naught else but ambition, perjury, policy, and
defamation. But if you will turn your eyes from thence to their temporal
government: surely I do think the recital of their miseries, would rather
breed in you admiration then belief, so far does the same exceed the compass
of all their tyrannies that ever were used. Count Egmont: Count Horn: marquis
of Bergues: Monsieur de Montigni, Monsieur de Strale: The Lord Gisbert and
Thery of Battenburg: Monsieur de Hares, Pierre de Andelot: The Lord Peter and
Philip of Alts etc. This was at such time as the young count of Egmond went with
a force of Lowcuntri-men into France, where he was slain at ye battaileof Yury,
leaving in the meantime Newmegen besieged by ye states, and brought to the
greatest misery that might be.
There is no calamaitie in the world, of which these miserable people has not
tasted: their country being as a stage, upon which for the space of this
twenty years, there has been nothing acted, but bloody tragedies. Their
noble men and rulers in whose virtue and courage consisted their chiefest
refuge in times past (when they were wronged and tyrannized) have been
murdered, strangled, poisoned, and slain: by the bloody ministers of their
cruel king. They are taxed in great sums of money, and numbers of their men
sent violently into France and foreign wars; and the relics of their
nobilite, forced to go with them to their apparent slaughter, leaving in the
mean time their own Country in pray to the neighboring enemy, their
villages flaming in fire, and their Towns battered about their ears, with the
cannon: Their privileges taken from them, their cities that sometimes striued
in opulence and glory with the goodliest and greatest of the world, are
governed by base and barbarous Spaniards, bridled with their garrizons and
Castles, and sackaged and spoiled by them at such time as their payment
fails. I could at length recite unto you the histories and declarations of
these several points here briefly touched, but that I should trouble you
with matter altogether tragical and delightlesse: and withal, they being so
common, apparent, and lately done, that there is scarcelye any one
unacquainted therewith, at least of such as have had any the least desire to
look into the estate of foreign matters. In fine, there is no face of justice
in their commonwealth, the same being wholly pliable to the will of such
strangers as are governors of their towns, and Captains of their Castles.
Their commonwealth justly now resembling the Turkish government, The Turkish
government.
where the peaceable estate obeyes the militar, and where there is no laws but
such as arms prescribe.

Their goodly Havens beautified sometimes with the concourse of innumerable
ships laden with rich merchandise, from out all parts of the world, are
now unfrequented even of fisherboates. Their trafique ceased, their towns
abandoned and made desert, of which some are utterly dispeopled, and in most
of the rest, of ten houses searsely three inhabited. Their villages abroad
burned, and ouergrowen with bushes, their goodly meddowes and fruitful
pastures drowned many miles wide and long, by letting in of sluices and cutting
down diches. The mansion houses and Castles of their Nobility, abated and
thrown down: Some by furye of the Cannon, some by violence of the soldiers,
for covetousness of the Lead, Iron, Glass, Marble, etc. And some by standing
long forsaken and abandoned of their owners: their errable ground lying many
large miles waste and untilled, insomuch that there a man may have as much land
as he will, and thanks withal, for the only manuring thereof.

As for the poor laboring people of the Country, (whom the Spaniarde never
calls but Villanos) for the most part they are all starued and consumed of
hunger, of which disease, (being according to the saying of the Greek Poet,
of all deaths the most miserable) I have my self known twenty thousand to
die in one Summer, and God knows how many more: namely, the year that
Marshall Biron lay encamped with the French army at Rozendale, and the
Englishmen at Oudenbesech: so that you may ride an hundred miles without
seeing of any man, woman, or child, unless it be some poor sillye souls
that come creeping out of the woods hunger-starued, more like resuscited
ghostes, than living Christian creatures. And yet all these in a manner
happyer, (because they are at an end of their miseries) than such as do live
within the inhabited places of the Country, as the land of Wast, the Kempine,
etc. For I take them of all the people in the world to be the most wretched
and miserable. Over every village of these are appointed certain horse men,
The misery of the inhabited places.
to whom they are constrained to pay monthly by contribution, some ten
crowns, some twenty, some forty, some more, and some less: I knew one that
paid an hundred crowns every month, called Turnolt: but they paid it so
long, till all the dwellers ran away, and have now in a manner left it
void of inhabitants. Over this village and the whole Country is appointed a
Commissarie called Sygonio, Sigonio, chief Commissary of yt contributions
for the distributing and ordering of these contributions, of all tyrants
living the most cruel, and of least conscience. Who if they fail, and do not
bring in their money at the last day of the month, he sendes forth troops
of horsemen, to take the best of them prisoners, and withal, to drive home to
their quarters or garrisons such sheep, horses, oxen, or cattle whatsoever,
as they find in their villages, which he causes, if the money follow not
within five or six days at the farthest, to be sold ta the Drum or Trumpet:
and withal, forces them to pay a great fine, the one half of which he
retains to himself, and the other he gives to the soldiers for their
out-roades and forbearance of their money.

But the misery of these poor people ends not here. For besides all this,
they are forced and compelled many times to lodge souldyers in their houses, as
they march along the Country upon service, at which time it is scarcelye
credible what outrages they receive. They have their cattle killed, to the use
of their unthankful guestes, their corn thresht out, and some carried away,
the rest given to horses, their chestes broken up, their goods, even to the
very sheets, and the tykes of their beds, (the feathers being turned
out,) stolen and carried away by the soldiers when they march; themselves
beaten, and besides constrained to give money, their wives and daughters
abused: and in fine, what else is to the nature of man most grievous and
intolerable, The barbarous cruelty of the Spanish soldier.
they are constrained to endure: yea, insomuch that I have seen the rude and
barbarous soldier cut off the fingers of women to come to their ringes, which
otherwise would not come off with such speed as they desired.

Neither is the condition of the poor Citizen or Townes-man any better, who
being constrained in places of garrison to lodge souldyers in their houses,
imparting to them the best lodgings and commodities of the same, never hearing
from them any other word, especially if he please them not in all their
exorbitaunt demaundes, than Perro, Flamenco, Luterano, Borachio, etc.

Yet besides all this, he is daily wearyed out with continual exactions and
taxations, as of the hundredth penny, the tenth penny, and once a year
without fail, the fifth penny of valor of all his goods and lands
whatsoever: besides infinite other pillages and gatheringes toward the making
of rampires, reuelins, bulwarks, palisados, countrescargres, casamats,
pertaining either to the reparation of their walls, or the fortification of
their Towns, and besides to giving of munition, bread, breere, and cheese, to
such companies of soldiers shall pass by their Towns distressed of
victuals, with infinite such like. I have known it (I speak it on my faith)
poor people of Antwarpe forced to sell their beds they lie upon, A strange
exaction of the king of Spain.
to satisfy these yrannous exactions, which if they should not do, execution
of their goods, and attachment of their persons should follow. But which is
most beyond reason, whereas within the Towns many of the houses lie vacant
and vnhired, yet the owners of them are taxed according to the value in which
they were wont to be rented. Insomuch that in Antwarpe and other Towns, it is
a matter very usual for men to disclaim, and quite their own houses,
thereby to be exempted of such payment, The Amptma^ is a magistrate for the
King, whose chief authority consists in the execution of civil causes, after
sentence given, which ye Dutchmen call Vonnysse Likewise in matter of
confiscation and forfaiture.
as otherwise by reason of them they are charged with, and that they do
formally before the magistrate, at which time the Amptman enters in, and
ceazeth them to the kings use.

But besides, whereas sundry Gentlemen, and others the inhabitants of these
provinces, having certain annual rentes issuing and growing out, and charged
upon the Kings demaines in the Duchy of Brabant, at least to the yearly
value of ten thousand pounds, some of which rentes have been by themselves
bought of the (...) states general, some left unto them by their parents and
predecessors, the King (without all conscience) most unjustly and wrongfully
disanulling the said rentes, has and does without all equity or form of
justice, take into his own hands the said demaines, appropriating the use,
commodity, and revenue thereof to the maintenance and keeping of his troops
of horse men.

Lykewse, what bondage can be greater than that of their Assizes, which
constrayneth them to pay for their wine and beer as much in equal portion to
the King, as they do to the Vintner or Brewer, from which the poor beggar is
not free, but if he will drink, he must pay as much unto the King, as he
does to the victualler. Neither do they eat their bread or flesh without
yielding and paying duties to the King.

Compare now (I pray you) heerewith, your estate of government at home, and
tell me which of the two you do think to be most fortunate. Does her
Majesty deal in this order with you, whose government you so much mislyke?

Oh good God, how can you be so perverse, seeing the great happiness and
security wherein she keeps and maintains you, as not to acknowledge and
confess the same? How gentle are the helps and subsidies which she exacteth
of you, without the undoing or hinderance of any man of whom they are
exacted? And on the other side, how profusely spends she her own treasure
for the maintenance of you, your wives, and children, in quietness, justice,
and freedom? Oh pray unto God therefore, that she may long and prosperously
live, for in her consists the type of your felicity.

But now to the other points of your mislike:
Whereas the adversary goes about by all means possible to beat into your
minds, a fearful imagination of the King of Spaines forces, and the
dangerous weakness of your state, persuading you that the same is far to
feeble and insufficient to withstand and resist so mighty an opposed enemy
as is the King of Spain, terrefying you with his millions of gold, and the
many, mighty, and powerful Nations over whom he commands: I hope,
notwithstanding all this ruffeling and great show, by clear and evident
reasons to let you understand and know, that the fame of him is far greater
than his force: and that there is not this day any prince in the whole
world, whose estate stands more tickle and ready to ruin than his, That
the fame of the king of Spain is greater than his power.
and that there is no cause why we should fear him, but many why he should
fear us.

First, that he is the most mighty and oppulent Prince, I do not deny, if
he had used moderation in his greatness, and acknowledged the great
benefits which it has pleased God to have bestowed upon him with
thankfulness, using them unto his glory, and not making them instruments of
his unlimited ambition, to the overthrow and destruction of his neighbors,
and the maintenance of factions wars in every corner of Christendom. To
which dissension occasioned by his means, we must needs attribute this late
formidable descent which the Turk has made into Christendom. But such is
now the estate where unto his all-coueting ambition has brought him, or
rather the reuengefull hand of almighty God, which hangs over his head, for
his many cruel, bloody, and unchristian practices, and aspiringe tyrannyes,
Apolog: principis Auraici.
especially for imbrewing his hands in the royal blood of his innocent wife,
of his eldest son Prince Charles, and of sundry other his best and truest
subjects, that he is in the midst of all his glory and pompeous
magnificence turmoyled with unquiet thoughts, and in the midst of his riches
and treasures indigent, poor, and indebted, unable to give satisfaction unto
such armies as he maintains, to which end he is forced to extort from his
poor subjects, and to make himself to all future ages a president of the
extremest tyranny, that ever in any time was used: of which his scarcity and
indigence, what more manifest proof can we desire, than the daily experience
which we have before our eyes, of his own natural subjects the Spaniardes,
who being the best disciplined soldiers he has, those of whom he makes
best and most account, and in fine, the very pillars that underprop his
tyranny, have nevertheless within these few years, for want of their
payment been sundry times constrained to enter into seditions and mutiny
against their general in the low Countries some five or six years since? it
was my hap to be then in Flaunders, when there were two thousand of them
that took one of his own towns called Courtray, and in demand of their
payment, the which was then three years behind, The mutiny of the Spaniards at
Courtray.
they displayed their ensigns, and planted their artillery upon the walls
against the Duke of Parma their General, refusing to obey his commandments,
and reproching him with words of infamy. For remedy of which inconvenience,
the Duke having no money, sent post upon post into Spain: but in seven
months there could not any money be gotten. Notwithstanding many and most
important detriments he received by occasion of this mutiny, as, the loss of
Bredno, the retardance of the intended succors for Paris, the danger of
Nieumegen etc. At length, by the fair persuasions of the Prince of Ascoly
their mutiny ceased with the receipt of a months pay or two, and promise of
more upon their return from France, which not being then performed, they
fell, and that greater troops of them, into a stronger mutiny than before.

Besides, look into the rest of his proceedings in these his Low Countries
(of which, because I have best experience I will chiefly speak) and you shall
not find any thing in the world that carries with it a greater appearance of
want. Neither (as the report goes) is it better in his other Provinces, which
verily I believe, seeing of all others it behooves him to use these best, as
being his eldest, perfectest in discipline, and best experienced troops: and
in fine, those (as I say before) upon whom the hopes of his ambition
depends. All which notwithstanding, I can not think that ever any Prince
has suffered so many valiant men, especially his own subjects, and within his
own Country to perish through hunger, or that has been driven to such
strange kind of shifts and devises to stop necessities, and to deceive his
soldiers, as he has.

First, the Country not being yet fully consumed, wasted, and destroyed, he
permitted his military troops, with barbarous inhumanitie to live upon the
spoil of the Country, to rifle the poor inhabitants, and to constrain them
to ransom their houses from fire, and their persons from murder by the which
means, the soldiers lingered in such sort, that I have known them remain
three years together without any one months pay, especially the horsemen. But
afterward, Antwerp being rendered, and by reason of the general deuastation
of the Country, the soldiers failing to find their woonted relief and prey,
grew into so great and miserable extremity, that it was a great matter to
find any ensign that was twenty strong.

The general mutiny of the kings army in the low countries.
The Spaniard mutined upon the staccada, whom presently they found means to
appease with some few months payment. The VVallons mutined in Liefekins hook,
and the land of waste. The Almanes went by hundreds begging up and down the
streets of Antwerp barelegged and barefooted, and in a manner naked. The
Italians starued in their quarters, and diverse of them in garrison at Bredavv,
ran thence to Huysden, and to other adjoining Towns of the enemy. For
remedy of all which inconveniences, he found means to deal with the Italian
Bankers of Antwerp for cloth and silk, as Northern kersies, packe-clothes,
bays, reffuse Italian veluets, taffataes, and satin, taking up the same at
excessive rates, yearly to a certain sum, for receipt of which, and delivery
out again, he appointed a Spaniard, one Christopher Caraesa, a man of most
wicked conscience to be his Treasurer.

The manner of the kings payment of his soldiers in cloth.
Then he began to grant payments to the whole camp, horse and foot, in
this manner of merchandise, and unto such Gentlemen and Pensioners as were in
great extremity, and had been long suitors: which they having received, were
forced for want of money presently to make sale of for the third part of that
value in which they received it. For, according to the high prises at the which
the were rated, and the badnesse of the stuff, it was not possible to get
more: so that a soldier having fourteen shillings a month, received for his
months pay, only four shillinges and six pence.

Caresa had always his Factours and Broakers abroad to buy those said
clothes and silks in again, the which he presently delivered out at the
first price to the next that came, and still forth delivering, and buying the
same in again, for the third part of the price, insomuch, that with ten
thousand pounds disbursed, it is probable, that he made payment of above a
hundred thousand pounds in the year: and yet sometimes he would make them stay
four or five months before he would deliver them cloth, or any contentment
at all: Within a while after he would many times never trouble himself with
the delivery of the cloth, but by a second, cause the suitors lyberansa to be
bought, as in the year of our Lord one thousand five hundred eighty and nine
sir William Standley before his departure thence into Spain bad obtained a
lyberansa in cloth for two months pay for his Regiment amounting unto two
thousand and five hundred crowns, the payment whereof being above a year
deferred, an Agent of his, after his departure, was feign to fell it for seven
hundred and fifty crowns, and yet thought that he had therein made a good
bargain. I have known sundry that have sold such their lyberansaes for eight
and twenty and thirty in the hundred: yet this payment how badde soever has
somewhat contented the soldiers four or five years, rather having that than
nothing: But now also the same is dried up and vanished: for the Marchantes
utterly refused to furnish the King with any more wares, both because the sum
wherein he stood already indebted unto them, amounted unto an excessive
matter, as also, that be began to wrangle with them about the interest, of
the which he craved moderation: and the rather, because they saw before their
eyes many fresh presidentes of men that were undone, and dishonored, such as
he had dealt withal. Amongst the rest, The kings hard and dishonorable
dealing with Simon Sweres.
one Simon Sweres a Portuguise Merchant greatly respected in Antwerp, as well
for the wealth and credit which he possessed, as also for the sincerity and
uprightness with which he handled the Duke of Parma, seeing after the
reduction of Antwerp the passage of the river shut up, and the country and
Towns, as likewise his army afflicted with great dearth and scarcity of corn
(rye being them in Antwerp about four and forty shillings the vierendall) and
withal, The vierendal is about four bushelles of our measure.
being daily cried upon by Trynquart the General of the Viures for munition
and corn to victual the camp, the old store being clean consumed, knew no
other means than to deal earnestly with this Simon Sweres, and other
Merchants that had trade with Hamborough, Lubecke, and the Easterlings, which
Countries were replenished with corn, to make some adventure thither for the
relief of their present extremity.

He among the rest showed himself not unwilling to enter into an action so
charitable and virtuous, so that his pains might be requited, and he
sufficiently warranted, and kept free from such danger as might ensue, either
by-perill of sea, taking of the enemies, or loss in the same when as it
should come.

To this end the Duke procured him the kings Letters of assurannce in the most
ample manner possible, encouraging him with fair words, and many promises to
proceed, which he did with the adventure of the most part of his credit and
goods, insomuch that he laded three ships, of which one was by tempest
scatered from the rest, and driven on the coast of Scotland where it perished:
the other two after many casualties and dangers arrived safe at Dungnergne: but
at that time such was either his ill luck, or the Countries good luck, that
upon a new plentiful year, they had such store of corn, that the price thereof
abated from forty four shillings to six shillings the vierendall, at which
price the Kings officers having made their provision, and furnished their
store, utterly refused to take that which arrived in the ships of Simon
Svveres, wrangling with him about the goodness thereof, and the long stay
which his Factors had made, whereby the poor man making suit unto the king by
one whom he presently dispatched into Spain, was forced to keep the same so
long upon his own hands, that it venowed and waxed mustie, in such sort, that
he was feign to throw the greatest part thereof away, without ever to this
day being able to receive of the king one penie of recompense, insomuch, that
he was constrained by reason of this, and other losses happening by the
occasion thereof to the wonderful shame, grief, and confusion of him, his
wife, his children, and his friends, having before time lived in as great
magnificence and good respected sort, as any Merchant in the town, to break
banker out: and I saw him at Brussels, suing to the Duke and to the privy
counsel for a protection to keep his body from attachment.

But shall we wonder at this his dealing with private men, His unkind dealing
with the Duke of Parma.
when he spared not in these reckonings of money to deal as bitterly with the
Duke of Parma himself, the unkindness of which was the greater, in regard
that the nobleness of the party to whom he used it, and the nearenesse to
himself in blood, being his own nephew, seemed even in honor unfit for the
receipt of so vnrespectfull a message? for whereas the D. of Parma not long
before his death had borrowed 30000. crowns of the Bankers of Antwerp, to
stop therewith a sudden extreme necessity that concerned exceedingly the
Kings service, and had for the payment thereof interposed his own credit and
assurance, which otherwise they refused to lend him, in regard of the kings
ill correspondence in their former recknings: Upon the next coming down of the
Kings money into Flaunders, the D. caused the said sum with the interest
thereof, to be according to his promise paid to the Merchants. Whereupon the
Treasurer general aduertising the K. his master of the late sum received,
and withal, of the deduction made by the Duke of Parma, for satisfaction and
payment of the Italian Bankers. The King presently wrote down a Letter unto
the Duke of Parma full of the bitterest and disgracefullest reprehensions that
possibly might be: amongst the rest, wondering how he dared presume to turn
such money to satisfaction of Merchants, as he had appointed unto the
maintenance of his army, commanding him from thence forward not to arrogate
unto himself so great an authority as to dispose his money to any other
uses, than such as he should ordain them for, and withal, rebuking the
Treasurer general for delivering the said sum, directly charging him, not
to do the like at any time, without his especial warrant. Which undeserved
indignity did so much grieve the Duke, chiefly, being guilty too himself of
the well employment thereof, and of his many notable and faithful services,
that he shut him self up for many days into his chamber, full of the
extremest melancholy that might be: the cause whereof being by the world
wondered at, his inward favorites did not stick to publish the same, in
manner and form as you see it here described.

Other men may hereof imagine as they please, but surely I cannot be
persuaded, but this his vnroyall dealing proceeds directly from a mere
disabilitie and unableness that he finds in himself to supply the infinite
charges of the many great enterprises with which he has entangled himself,
of which if you desire to have better experience, look but into the office of
his treasure at Brusselles, and I doubt not but you will confirm my opinion.
There you shall see a miserable troop of suitors with lyberansaes in their
hands, The in dige^co of his Treasurer general, and the misery of such as are
suitors unto him at Brussels.
some of the which have lost a leg or an arm, some, that wearied with the
wars, and pretending either age or infirmities, have gotten their licenses
and pasportes to depart into their Countries, some alleging one cause, and
some another: but in fine no one of them al (in less than two or three years
following him) able to get a penny, so that there is no year but a great number
of them die for hunger, yea and some of them even at his gates. I assure you on
my credit, I have known some poor people, that for the sum of fix pounds
have followed him three years, when either he goes out or comes in to his
house, he is feign to go through gardens and bie-waves to deceive his poor
suitors, who otherwise enraged with desperate necessity, did assail him,
though in vain with such lamentable and ruefull cries, that it would pearce
any honest man's heart to bear them.

But here by the way I think it not amiss to tell you two pretty jests that
happened at Brussels whiles I was there, in the year of our Lord one thousand
five hundred and ninety, the one of a Spanish, and the other of a Sycilian
soldier, either of which practiced his wit upon John de Lasture the Kings
treasurer, to the obtaining of a little money, for the which they had a long
time followed in vain. A notable cosoning trick of a Spanish soldier.
The Spaniard gets him to the guardian of the gray Friars in Brusselles,
professing with a marvelous contrition and remorce of conscience, an exceeding
zeal and inclination to enter into religion, praying him in christian charity
not to refuse to receue him, seeing it had now pleased God to touch his heart
with so godly and zealous a desire: in fine, he used such perswasiue speeches
that the guardian was contented presently to admit him, and withal, to allow him
a time of probation, after the which, if in the mean time he did not mislike
of their orders, nor they of his behavior, he promised to accept him into
their fraternity. Presently a Friars long coat with a cowle was given him,
which, after he had worn three or four days, and learned the behavior
thereto belonging, he acquainted the guardian with certain debts that he had in
the town wherewith his conscience was greatly burdened, Mary withal, that he
had a lyberansa able to discharge them, and overplus besides remaining, which
he meant to bestow upon the Cloister, if that the Treasurer would be so
favorable unto him as to pay the same: to which end he requested the guardian
to accompany him, and to help to entreat the Treasurer in that behalf, to
which he consented, and being both admitted to the presence of the Treasurer
the new converted brother: first with a Friars ducke low to the ground, then
with a very reverent gesture and humble speech, told him that he came not now,
as in former time to importunate him for money, but only to signify to his
Lordship, the grace the which it had pleased God by his holy spirit to work in
him, praying him from hence forward to continue his good Lord and patron, as
he would for ever in his spiritual function remain his Orator and
bedseman: Mary withal, that the debts which he had made during his time of
being a suter, lay heavy upon his conscience; and withal, his creditors came
clamorously to the cloister, in such forte that the guardian there present had
threatened to expel him the house, unless he took present order for their
satisfaction; which, as it could not but be greatly to his bodily shame, even
so might it also turn to the destruction of his soul, if he should be now
again thrust into the wandering courses of the world, which of necessity he
must be, unless it would please his Lordship to be good unto him, and to
cause his poor lyberansa to be paid; and therewith wiping his eyes, as
though he had wept, made an other low reverence, neither was the guardian
behind to confirm his speeches, and earnestly in his behalf to entreat the
Treasurer, who at the general request of the standers by, as also, that he
felt his own conscience beginning to wamble with compassion, after he had
encouraged him with many comfortable words to patience and perseverance in that
blessed estate of life, caused his lyberansa to be taken, and his money to be
forthwith paid: upon which with many himble thanks took their leave. The
Spaniard upon his return to the Cloister, told the guardian, that he could not
by any means conform the frailenes of his flesh to that austeritie of life.
And therefore with many hearty thanks delivering him his coat, went his ways
to make good cheer amongst his Cameradoes, not gloyifying a little in the
happiness of his success.

The like practice of cousonage used by a Sycilian.
But now to our Sycilian: he having by many obseruances found the humor of the
Treasurer chiefly to be addicted to one especial Jesuit, above any other of
the College, as both being his ghostly father, as also otherwise of very
private conversation with him, and finding the Jesuit one day hearing of
confessions in the Church of their College, according as their custom is,
kneeled down, and when his turn came uttered his confession, in the end
whereof he interrupted his speeches with many sighs, as though there were
something hanging in his teeth, that he was loath to commit to the utterance of
his tongue. Which the Jesuit perceiving with many protestations and
assurances, both of his comfort and counsel, encouraged and persuaded him to
reveal it, insomuch, that after a long show of great unwillingness and
drawing back, he told him that he had made a solemn oath and vow to kill
John de Lasture the Kings high Treasurer, moved thereunto by a violent despair
whereunto his extreme and rigorous dealing had driven him. The Jesuit amazed
at so strange a speech, failed not to tell him, that the observation of such a
vow was much more wicked, than the breach thereof, and withal, that the
performance would procure both his bodies death, and his souls damnation. The
soldier replied, that he knew his words to be true, and withal, that he
had in his mind already forecast this and much more: nevertheless, that his
mind was so strongly possessed with this dispairefull and dreadful
resolution, that it was not in his power to withdraw his thoughts from the
desire to accomplish it. Whereupon the Jesuit seeing that it was not in his
force to divert him from that, upon which, to his seeming, his mind had so
fully resolved, requested him yet, that he would the next morning at eight of
the clock meet him in the same place again, and he would confer further
with him. Which the soldier promising, the Jesuit presently repaired to the
Treasurer, and after his solemn oath taken never to prosecute any thing
against the fellow, acquainted him with what had happened, forgetting not
withal to dilate much of the wild countenance and amazed gesture of the
fellow, and therefore wished him, not by any means to hazard a thing of so
great value as his life upon the frantic resolution of a desperate soldier.
The Treasurer not daring to apprehend the fellow, lest thereupon danger might
have ensued to the Jesuit for revealing a thing uttered in confession, and
withal, restrained by his oathe, requested him to bring him with him the next
morning, which the Jesuit not failing to do, they found a fellow ready in the
hall to receive them with money, who taking the soldiers lyberansa, gave him
presently satisfaction, which was of such virtue, that it assoiled him of his
vow.

In fine, you may see that these are no great tokens of that bottomless plenty
which they speak of, when poor men that have spent their years, and their
blood in his service, must be driven to use such dishonest sleights and
cousoning devises for the obtaining of their money. Neither (as I hear) is the
matter much better in Spain it self, even there where the storehouse of his
treasure is. For I my self have seen many coming thence poor and penylesse,
cursing their journey, and denied the suites they went for. And withal, I
heard not long agone a gentleman of good sort and judgment say, that it was
his hap to be in Spain, at such time as sundry of those Spaniards that had
bin prisoners here in England after the overthrow of their Amada arrived there
poor and miserable, where he saw great troops of them suing in the court for
some small relief, but to so small purpose, that he heard diverse of them
exclaim even before the Secretaries door, and wish themselves in England
again, for there they had meat and drink and lodging, whereas in their own
Country they could not get any. The sight of this hard and beggarly usage, but
especially the feeling of that which they themselves received, have made many
great and worthy soldiers to abandon him with mighty discontentments, as
amongst the rest John Baptista de Monte, and Camillo de Monte, two notable
Captains, John Baptista de Monte. Canullo de Monte.
both now retained under two mighty States the one being General to the Duke
of Florence, the other bearing like charge under the Venetians, who both lie in
awaite to cry quittance with him.

And if report be true, I hope ere it be long we shall hear that they have
accomplished their desire; for they say these two States begin to shuffle the
cards, which if it be so, it is very likely that they will deal the King of
Spain but an ill game. Once it is certain, that the Duke of Florence his
brave bastard brother Don John de Medicis, who had a pension of four hundred
crowns by the year from the king of Spain, Don John de Medicis has
renounced the king of Spaines pension.
has sent him back both his pension and his pattent; and he raises troops
of horsemen, but to what end and purpose, the sequel will show.

The Venetians well affected to the French King.
As for the Venetians, their Ambassador resident in the French Kings Court,
and their apparent favors done him from time to time, sufficiently declares
their affections unto the other side: But these things being above my reach, I
will leave them to their success, and so return to my matter.

The unnoble and ungrateful usage of sir Martin Skinke.
Sundry of you have known, and scarcely any but has heard of that renowned
Germane sir Martine Skinke, a man both in courage of attempting, and judgment
in directing and managing matters of war, scarcely second to any Captain of
our time: the story of his life and fall is as common as pitiful, and
therefore I will not trouble you with the rehearsal of it, neither is it
incident unto the matter I entreat of; only I will briefly acquaint you with
some part of his deserts, and the recompense which he in fine received, to
the end that you may the better judge what reward or advancement after long
deserving and infinite merits is in this penurious service to be expected.
First, after the memorable siege of Mastricht upon the last departure of the
Spaniardes out of the low Countries, according to the capitulation between the
K. and the provinces of Henalt and Artoys, who thereupon put themselves in
the Kings obedience, whereas the Duke of Parma serving himself in his wars,
only of the VVallons of the country, and a few Italian horsemen was daily
ouertopped by the Prince of Orange, and the French, not knowing scarcely where
to turn him for want of Forces to keep the field: Skinke brought him out of
Germany a mighty power of Reyters, which coming in such a season, you must
imagine were welcome, as being indeed the only occasion of many great
exploites which the Duke of Parma happily achieved.

Secondly, after the siege of Cambray raised, and the town of Cambray,
Lyberium, and Saint Gillians taken by the French, and on the other side the
towns of Eyndouen and Helmont, and the Castles of Buxtell, Hemer, Lemmicke,
and Midlaer, taken in Brabant by the States, the duke of Parma being as much or
more distressed than before, Skinke brought him a second supply of at least
five and twenty hundred horsemen, which (as I have often heard him say) he
had levied in a manner wholly upon his own charge, joining the which with
certain troops of footmen, being under the charge of Monsieur de
Houltepenne, he took in all those forenamed places which the ennemy had
surprised in Brabant, and clearing the country round about, did many other
notable services of importance. But to be short; it was at last his chance, by
a treacherous plot that was laid for him, to fall into his enemies hands, and
to be carried prisoner into Gelders: of which one Ouersay a German was at
that time governor for the States, who being glad of such a prize, in regard
that he was his country man, and so great a soldier, endeavored by all means
and practice possible to divert his mind and affection from the Spaniardes,
but finding him still most resolutely faithful and constant to the party which
he followed, he caused him to be imprisoned in a great obscure filthy Tower
of the Town, and withal, set him at an excessive ransom, such as he did
think would exceed the compass of his ability to discharge. Skinke in the
mean time by his friends earnestly solicited the duke of Parma to help him
with somewhat toward his ransom: but in fine, seeing there came nothing from
thence but delays and dilatorie excuses, he used such means by the sale of
his goods and the help of his other friends, that after fifteen months
imprisonment he procured his liberty, and came directly to the D. of Parma,
lying then at the siege before Antwerp at a place called Beuer, where it was
my chance to see him a long suter, without obtaining any the least help at
all, such was at that time the Dukes necessity, insomuch I assure you, that I
have heard Skinke earnestly protest, that he had not in his purse wherewithal
to buy him so much as a pair of shoes (for those were his very words)
neither had he known where to have gotten meat or drink, but that by good
hap he met there with Chenovvs a Germane, to whom he was much beholding
for relief in these great extremities: In fine, seeing no money was to be
gotten, he desired the government of Nieumegen, the which by a devise of his
plotting was newly rendered: nevertheless he was denied, and the same given to
Monsieur de Haultpenne. Then he desired the Kings commission to leuy a
standing regiment of Dutch footmen, that likewise was denied. Lastly, to
stop his mouth, he had a company of horsemen granted him, with which going
down into Gelderland, he put himself presently into employment. But winter
coming on, when all the Kings horsemen had their quarter appointed them, for
the receipt of their contribution: He likewise sent his Furrier to Sigonio
chief commissary for those causes to demand such quarter, contribution, and
allowances as were appointed to the other troops of horsemen, who sent him
word that his company was not enroled within the list of the Kings horsemen,
and therefore, that he had not authority to assign him any, whereupon Skinke
went presently unto the Duke of Parma, requesting his Highness to cause his
company to be enrolled in the listes, and to command, that they might
receive such usage as the rest; but his answer was, that the King would not
raise any other new companies, but rather had sent commission down to
cassiere many of the old companies.

Nothing ever more moved Skinke, than the indignity of this dealing, and so
telling the Duke, that he would be loath now he had spent all that ever he
had, in the Kings service, to be accounted a Captain of Fryboters, Fryboters,
are such as are not lawful fouldyors on either side but live only upon
spoil robbery and ^apyn^.
took his leave, bending his mind presently to revenge, and is forthwith
surprising Nuis by a stratageme, delivered both the same and the castle of
Lemmicke, and withal, his own person into the service of the States, of whom
he was received with such honor as to a man of such worthynesse belonged. I
know not what may hereof be imagined, but in common sense and reason, this not
requiting the deserts of men of such exceeding value, argues either an
unwillingness, or else an unableness to do the same; if an unwillingness,
what comfort then shall a man have to spend his years and fortunes in so
ungrateful a service? It unableness, as in respect of the hinderance and
inconvenience thereby ensuing to his own service I rather judge it: where is
then this ouerflowing plenty and endless treasure, with opinion of which they
endeavor so far to possess the world, as though every man that does him
service should be choked with gold for his labor? To what end uses he
this scarcity in rewards and payments? or when will he use his golden
mountains, if not now, the loss of his Country, honor, and religion, and
the greatness of his undertaken enterprises considered? No undoubtedly, it is
mere want and indigence that drives him to these exigents: he is mighty, but
he gripeth at more than he is able to embrace: he is rich, but the
infinitenes of his charge exceeds the measure of his riches: upon the
coming down of his last fleet, he set up his rest and lost it with an evil
encounter, and that not only his own, but that also of his friends, the
Popes, the D. of Sauoy, the Genovvese, etc. which set him in such arrerages,
that I think he will not hastily come out of them.

As for the treasure of his Indies, wherein indeed consists the very
marrowe, strength, and substance of all his puissance I confess the same to
be exceeding great: yet his occasions considered, and making an estimate
between the one and the other, I account the one (as I said) far too feeble
to answer the unlimited greatness of the other: and yet the same has been
reasonably impai^ed also since such time as sir Frauncis Drake, and other
worthy English Captains have found the means to firret him in those parts,
since which time the return of his Indian fleet has not kept the course it
was wont to do, but stays sometimes half a year, sometimes more, longer
than it was accustomed, and yet comes not securely home in the end: and
whereas he was woonted to waft them home only with a Galleasse or two, he is
now constrained to entertain a great and mighty navy of many ships to his
inestimable and continual charge.

The King of Spaines treasures vnanswering and inferior to the infiniteness of
his charge.
If you desire to know what these great charges are, on which he is enforced to
emply them, first you must confider that he scarcely holds any of his
Provinces wherein he is not constrained to hold garrisons of soldiers, and
not as other Princes are accustomed, upon the frontiers only, but even in the
heart and inland places of them, as well to resist the foreign suspected
enemy, as for to repress the natural tyrannized subject, who upon every
offered occasion are ready to take arms to recover their liberty, and to free
themselves from forth the yoke of his hateful government, as the Indies,
Arragon and Flaunders will bear me witness.

As for his Low Countries, of the which I will first speak, because they are
nearest; it is manifest, that there is not any town or castle (besides many
fortes, skonces, and blockehouses) in which he is not constrained to hold a
garrison, unless he utterly raze and dismantle the same, as he has already
done Eyndouen, Terlemount, Leavv, Sickem, Susteren, etc. Antwerp alone as the
case now stands, being of greater charge unto him than the revenue which he
receives out of the whole country is able to defray. For, besides the
continual maintenance of a thousand Spanish footmen in ordinary garrison
within the Castle, besides Canoniers and officers that do attend upon the
artillery, munitions, provisions, and infinite other charges thereto belonging
he is forced to maintain two companies of horsemen in the town, as well for
conuoyes, sallies, as sundry other occasions that are daily presented, and
withal, seven or eight ships of war under the walls of the town upon the
river to secure the same from the incursions of the Zelanders, both to keep
them from attempting any thing upon the town, as also from piercing further
down along the river, he was once determined before the coming down of his
great Armada to have increased his number of shipping there; and to that end
commanded the duke of Parma to make provision of timber, anckres, sails,
cables, and tackeling, the which was done with an infiniteness of charge, and
at length eight hundred Genovves, mariners, and shipwrights sent down, who
were presently set aworke about the making of twelve new great ships all at
once. But before they were half finished (whether the greatness of the
charge, or what other occasion moved him thereunto I know not) but he sent a
new commandment to make only four of them up, of which the one was great
galeon Alexander, The great galeon Alexander and her posie.
who bears aloft in her starne a great blazing Sun with this posie
underneath, Non fert terra duos. The other eight I saw long after lying in the
Docke like rotten carcases, with their ribs out, in which estate they do yet
remain for any thing I know.

In fine, so great and excessive are his charges, in those parts, that I do
know it upon good and assured grounds there has been no one year these
twenty years, but that they have cost him two millions and more yearly above
the commodities and revenues which they do yield him, and yet scarcely any
man contented.

Neither are his provinces of Italy in a manner of less expense, or greater
commodity unto him: for, besides the strong and puissant garrisons, which even
of necessity he does maintain in the great Castelles of Millaine, Naples,
and the many other fortified places, he is constrained to entertain in
yearly pension, the greatest part of the Nobility and Gentlemen of either
province, thereby to keep them from attempting any manner of nouelty against
his government; than the which all the world knows right well, (especially
whosoever has been in Italy, or is any thing acquainted with the estate of
those countries) there is nothing more odious, Nothing so odious to the Italian
as the government of a Spaniard.
displeasing; and contrary to the nature of an Italian.

Likewise he is feign to entertain continually a great number of galleys
upon the coast of Naples, to defend those seas and shoares from the incursions
of the Turk: the like charge by sea and by land he is forced to be at in
Sycilia, Sardina his Cities on the coast of Africa, Portugal, the Terceraes,
the Indies, Brasile, Maiorque Minorque, yea and even in his Spanish Provinces,
of Biscan, Galycia, and Arragon; as for Navarre he knows that he holds
them no longer than he treads upon their necks, and therefore he lays
on load there with his garrisons both of horsemen and footmen, as well in
Pampelona as the other Towns and Fortresses of the Country, and all will be
little enough and if it would please almighty GOD to bless the endeavors of
the French King.

And of all these his garrisons and charges, he cannot for his life diminish
any, being guilty too himself of the violence of his government, being not
further assured of them, than whiles he holds their heads in the bridle. I
will not dispute the justice of his Titles, not yet allege the pretenses,
whereby the Frenchmen entitle their King, not only to Artoys, Henalt, Naples,
and Millaine, but also to Spain it self. But that he holds Portugal,
Maiorque and Minorque, the County of Ronsillen, and the kingdom of Navarre by
mere extortion and extremity of wrong, is to all the world a matter most
apparent and evident, insomuch that some of his own Writers, in their
Apologies and defenses of some of his Titles, are constrained in a manner to
fortify their best reasons with the verses of Eurypides:

If right and justice are to be transgrest,
To break them for a kingdom then to is best.
Besides all this, his provinces and dominions do stand so severed and
disunited, that the very transporting of his money from one to an other, as it
is with danger and inconvenience, so is it of it of infinite charge unto him,
insomuch that I have heard some of his Commissaries in the Low Countries
swear, there is no crown of his that comes from Spain into those parts but
stands him in five ryalles of plate, so great is the charge of carriage,
conuoyes and commissaries to deliver and receive the same from one place to
another.

He norisheth factions and divisions in most Countries of christendom. His
Intelligencers and Spies.
Withal there are few Realms or Countries of Christendom, in which he
entertaineth not factions and divisions and scarcely any in which he nourishes
not a number of Intelligencers and Spies, all depending of his purse, with
whom he deals more or less liberally, according unto the place or means
they have to do him service, if they be entertained in Court, or near about
the person of a Prince, able to send him good intelligence, or to do some
notable mischief for him, His detestable p^actise with Lopes for the taking
away of her Majesty's life.
he will not stick to come off bountefully; as for example you saw how
cunningly he had practiced with Lopes that damnable Physician, who like his
predecessor Judas had for money consented to betray innocent blood, to whom
besides the fifty thousand crowns for which the bargain was, he commanded
his Secretary Ibarra to bid him demand what else he would, so that he
would take upon him to perform that which he had promised, which was by
taking away her life, by whom we do all live, to bring our noble Country
into such a sorrow, desolation, and misery, as never any Nation had tasted
the like. But it has pleased the Lord our God of his endless mercy, as he
has always mightily and miraculously defended her Majesty, so likewise now
to confound the wicked conspiratours in their own devilish devises, and to
prevent the tragical intended issue of their most barbarous and bloody
practice, being such, as well in regard of the secrecy of handling, as the
imagined facility of performaunce, that of many which he, the devil, and
their adherents have set abroach since the beginning of her Majesty's glorious
reign, never any (to man's judgment) was half so dangerous; the manner and
memory whereof is so fresh, that the recital of any particularities would be
but superfluous.

Only let us not forget to be thankful unto almighty God for his mercy
showed in revealing it: nor unto that worthy and honorable Lord, by whose
watchful industry and zealous care of her Majesty's safety, it was first
suspected, and finally, by his wisdom and discreet handling fully
discovered, who although he did before possess the faithful loves and
undissembled affections of as many as ever did any of his rank; yet never did
he (although he has done many things virtuously and nobly) any thing, that
won him such reputation and applause throughout the whole Realm: All men in
general, and every man in particular acknowledging to have herein received
of him a most singular and peculiar benefit.

All his kinsemen of the house of Austria depend chiefly upon the maintenance
of his purse.
But leaving this, and returning unto my former matter; it is a thing notorious
to all the world, that the house of Austria is spredde into many branches, of
which every one reteineth the name of Archduke.

But in conclusion, their dignity, lordeshippe, and estate is feign to rely
wholly upon his purse: for there is not any thing in all this world that he
more affects, than to mainetaine this house of Austria in greatness and
dignity, and therefore upon the death of Battor the last King of Polonia, he
labored infinitely to inuest his coosine Maximilian the Emperors brother in
the royalty of the Realm, Maximilian of Austria sent by the King of Spain
into Polonia with an army.
sending him down (besides many secret bribes bestowed upon the noblemen of
Polonia) with a mighty army of Reyters to take possession: the unfortunate
success of which enterprise, as also the Archedukes imprisonment and
dishonorable escape, I do voluntarily omit as being a thing unto the whole
world well known, and altogether impertinent unto the discourse which I have
in hand.

In the Consistory of Rome he is feign to entertain a great number of those
hungry Cardinals in pension and fee, as well to gain their voices, when
need requires, as also when the pontifical sea is void, to look well to
their election, especially, and above all things, that he whom they elect
can dance the Spanish Measures, in which if after his being chosen, he
should chance not to foot it well, according unto the tune of his pipe, then
presently to remove him with a Castilian Calenture, A Castilian Calenture.
the which is a strange disease, never lightly holding them above three days,
and many of them of late have been subject unto it.

This Pope does fear it mightily, and that makes him so loath to accept the
French Kings reconciliation, though, as in Religion, so in Policy and Estate,
he knows that there is not any thing more expedient and necessary for him,
than to have a mighty King in France, that may serve to hold the King of
Spain some tacke, and serve as a barriere between him and Italy; for his
predecessors have along time since discovered this secret, that there is not
any thing more necessary for the maintenance of the Pontifical dignity, as
the ballancing of kings in equal counterpoise one with another: which he now
in respect of the king of Spaines increased greatness is not able to do; and
yet underhand I do think he could be very well content, to see his wings a
little clipped, lest one of these days he take his flight into Italy (as his
father did) and make him as a private Bishop of a diocese to do nothing but
whatsoever it shall please him to command him.

Pope Sixtus liked not the amo^ious greatness of the Spanish K.
Pope Sixtus, was accounted one of the greatest Politicians of our time, like
nothing at all this ouerweying greatness of the King of Spain, as he told his
Ambassador plainly one day in the Consistory, when he braued him with
threatenings and commandments from the King his Master. But presently the
smell of the Spanish gold that certain of his Cardinals had in their
purses, struck him into such a calenture, that much against his will he was
feign to take his leave of the world, and leave behind him vneffected many
great matters, on the which he had in his mind determined. So that although
the King of Spain be at great charge with these noble pillars of the Church,
yet you see, that sometimes of their sides it is not unrequited, seeing that
for his sake, they are contented so honestly to betray their Master. He had
not many years since an other charge no whit at all inferior to this, which
was in maintenance of the pension in wars against the Turk. But how the
matter stands since the late agreement between these two Princes I know
not, but I do imagine that his treasures walk that way still: for, Turpius
eijcitur quam non recipitur hospes: Pensions and entertainements given to
strangers, as for the time they procure a certain hired and mercenary
affection, so their withdrawing engendereth for ever a deadly and everlasting
hatred. Lastly, for conclusion, he makes at this instant open wars with
France, England, and the Low Countries: what deem you then hereof? Has he
not vent (trow you) for his treasures? His father was a better soldier, and
a greater man of war than he is, and of much more mightiness and puissance;
for, in steed of Portugal and the Indies thereunto belonging wherewith this
has increased his dominions, the other swayed the mighty Empire of the
Germans, and that with such a commanding authority over that proud Nation,
as never any of his predecessors since Charlemaine did the like; and withal,
he quietly enjoyed the whole seventeen Provinces of the Low Countries, whom
in respect of their great opulence, abundance of riches, and conuenientnesse
of situation, Monsieur de la Noue. Discourse sur l'estate de France.
some late Writers of great authority have not spared to compare unto his
Indies; and yet he never dared to make wars upon France alone, before he
had first sought by all manner of possible means, to assure him self in
friendship with England, giving to that end great and mighty presents unto
Cardinal Wolsey, and other of the Nobility, that in those days did bear
sway with her Majesty's father of most famous and worthy memory King Henry
the eight: whereas this makes war carelessly with all the world at once, but
the Italians have a true proverb; Chitutto abbraccia, nessuno stringe: He that
embraces all, holds not any fast.
And so I hope it shall fare with him.

Now as touching those his mighty and puissant numbers wherewith they do go
about to strike such terror and fear into your minds; I do take upon me
to know the estate of his forces as well as an other man. And I do not think
him to be in any thing more penurious than in the want of men: for as for
Spain, Naples, and Lumbardy, upon which his only force does consist, and
which are his principallest and chiefest Storehouses of men, it is
sufficiently known that his Drums have gone at the least the space of a
whole year together beating up and down, according as the manner is, to
gather together six thousand men, and those all Sheepeheardes, Hedgepikers,
and such idle trewantly rogues, the most part of the which he is forced to
put into garrisons for the space at the least of a year or two, to the end
to fashion them, before he do send them to service; for, upon their first
levy, you did never in all your life see more seely snakes than they are. I
saw some few years since a great number of them brought down into the Low
Countries, fresh out of Spain by the Duke of Pastrana, such ragged beggarly
staruelings, that in my very conscience I do speak as I think, a man indeed
would have beaten ten of them.

As for Germany, out of the which heretofore he has drawn great numbers,
and by their good help he has achieved many great matters, his usage has
been so base and miserable unto them, that the old soldiers are all starued
and consumed in his service, whose calamity has so much feared and terrified
the rest at home, that no Prince in Europe has less credit to raise men
there than he has. And although there were no such kind of matter, yet they
are no manner of way bound unto him more than to an other, their profession
being to serve only him that will pay them best, and yet if he should raise
any of them (the alliaunces of her Majesty, and the situation of their
Country considered) it should be a matter of great difficulty to join them
with his other troops.

Where are then his innumerable legions, with which these mount-banke loud
mouthed felows, say he is able to ouerrunne the world? Alliances he has
none, unless it be with the holy rebellious league of France; the which now
of late is grown very sick, and keeps the chamber, The holy League of
France is of late grown very sick.
and every day we do look to hear the news of the death and Vltimum vale
thereof; and yet when the patrons thereof were in best health, was never of any
assistance, but of a continual burden and charge unto him: Neither did he
ever trust his chief Agentes in this same sanctified society, nor they ever
love him. Each of them working and drifting with particular ends and meanings:
of the which I will speak but a word or two succinctly, leaving the rest to
men that are of better ability to dilate upon, which (in my judgment) in
regard of the practices, iuglings, diffidences, circumuentions, underminings,
treacheries, mischiefs, and conspiracies that have been between them, would
yield matter to as delightful an history, as has been penned in our time.

The pretense of the kings of France to Naples and Milan
First, no man is ignorant of the pretention and title which the Kings of
France do pretend to the kingdom of Naples, the dukedom of Millaine, the
County of Ronssillon, and the earledomes of Artoys and Henalt; for the recovery
of which, still as they have been within themselves at quiet, they have made
one attempt or other: always therefore one of the chiefest policies of the
King of Spain, has been to find them work at home; insomuch, that though
it be strange, yet the Frenchmen do very confidently write it, that such was
his desire to keep civil dissension afoote in France, that he spared not to
animate, yea and sometimes secretly to help and assist with money. The prince
of Conde and the Admiral although all the world knows, he neither liked
their cause, nor religion, the like they say he offered to this King of
France when he was King of Navarre, though he knew he could not offer it
to a man in the world which less loved him.

But leaving these secret excusable matters, and coming to open and published
apparent practices: Seeing that the last King of France beginning to grow
strong and mighty, the Protestants quiet, and his Realm peaceable, he
thought it high time to look about him, and therefore casting his eyes upon
the discontented humors of France, he amongst the rest made choice to use as
a principal instrument for shuffling the Cards the late Duke of Guyse, The
duke of Guyse picked out by the K. of Spain to set civil warr^ afoote in
France.
a brave and valorous Prince, haughty, ambitious, audacious, a soldier, a
spender, prodigal, popular, and indebted even up to the hard cares.

Him he fed with money, which, though not answerable to his humor; for to
that effect his Indiaes had been to tithe, yet it put him in such gallant
humors, that he presently reproachfully gave out amongst the people, that
the King was a favorer of heretics, a scismaticke, and a sorcerer, and
withal, The audacious insolence of the duke of Guyse.
he called hi himself Protector of the Church of France; and finally, grew
to so great an insolency, that being forbidden by the King, he durst enter
into Paris, put the people in arms, assail the Kings Guardes; and finally,
constrain the king by flight to abandon both the City and his Palace of the
Lonure. The day of which holy enterprise was ordained by the Sorbonists to be
kept holiday, and called the day of the Barricades. The day of Barricades.


The king was mightily agreeued heereat: but being not able to play the Lion,
was contented for a while to counterfeit the Fox, using the matter so slily
that he drew the duke of Guyse and his brother the Cardinal to the parliament
of Bloys, where with fair and gentle words, he so finely ouerwent them in
the midst of al their confidence and greatness, that whereas they did
attribute all his friendly shows and offers to want of courage, The duke of
Guyse and the Cardinal his brother slain by the king of France.
and feebleness of spirit, he nevertheless still perseuered pretending all
love and meekness, until such time, as taking them at advantage he saw them
both he dead and bleeding at his feet.

The news of which tragical accident was not so much displeasing to the king
of Spain in regard of their deaths, upon whom his factious business so much
relied, as it was pleasing insomuch that the greatness of their parentage, the
multitude of their followers and partiseans, and the affections of the people
considered be knew, that there could not but ensue, many great tumultuous and
in a manner irreconcilable broiles; Mendoza the king of Spains Ambassador in
Paris.
to which effect, Mendoza his purblinde Ambassador in Paris serving for
nothing, but like the Diuelles trumpetter to set men together by the ears,
used the uttermost of his endeavor and diligence, incenfing the people to such
ragefull madness, that though murdering one an other with mutual wounds
(which was the only thing they shot at) they saw apparently their own
miserable calamity and destruction, yet like men troubled with a frenzy,
abhorring all remedy and cure, they grew from degree to degree into so great a
fury and violence, that they procured the death of their anointed king, by the
hands of a detestable Iacobine, The king of France murdered by a Iacobine Friar.
whom as a late Frenchman writes, they have since, in regard of that worthy
exploit canonized for a martyr, by the name of S. Clement.

These things succeeding so much to the Spanish kings desire, whereas before
his endeavor was, to nourish between them only civil dissension and strife,
he now began to entertain greater hopes, and to aspire to the very royal
diadem and monarchy of France. To which end he caused his Ambassador to hire
the Sorbonists, Jesuits, and mercenarie Friars to step up into the pulpits,
and to insinuate to the people the necessity of a K. especially of such a one
as were mighty and of power, to resist the K. of Naaurre, coming then puisant
in arms against them. Mendoza likewise spared not himself to broake his
masters cause by bribery, and all the other best bad means he could, persuading
them, his Master having married a daughter of France, and his children being
half French, that they could not so safely throw themselves into the bosom or
protection of any man as of his: but in fine, The Cardinal of Burbon elected
king of France by the name of Charles the tenth.
the Parisiens liked better of his gold than his government, and elected for
their king the old Cardinal of Burbons uncle, and at that time prisoner to the
king that now is, calling him Charles the tenth. But he being near 80. years
of age, was scarcely so soon chosen as dead.

The duke of Feria sent down to Paris.
Then began Mendoza to bestir himself again, and within a while likewise to
help him the better, the D. of Feria was sent down: but the utmost that both
could do with infinite and profuse expense of their masters money, was to get
him the title of Protector of France: provided always, that the Spanish
pistolets kept their course, The king of Spain chosen Protector of France.
which only kept him from being discarded: for how closely soever he hand led
the matter, the League had discovered, that like a Canker he meant to eat
into their estate. And therefore, though they could not break with him, their
business being now brought to a necessity of him and of his money, yet they
liked not his intiteling himself to Britain, and sundry other his
proceedings, all tending to usurpation, insomuch, that they held him in so
great a jealousy, diffidence, and mistrust, that they would never suffer any
of his forces for to enter into any of their Towns or places of importance,
The King of Spain, and the League in jealousy one of an other.
but had continually as watchful an eye over him as they would have done
over their ennemy. Neither was he (how fair a show soever he made) behind
them in the like subtlety of practice, as the course of his actions did well
declare. For, when as they were by this King so straightly besieged in Paris,
that they were ready to eat one an other through hunger, he made his
Lieuetenant the Duke of Parma, although he were long before ready, yet still
to delay his succors, even until that they labored in their last gasp; and
then the great effect that he did for them, was only to put a few brown loaves
and cheeses into their Town, not therewith to relieve the extremity of their
famine, but even as if a man would give a lock of hay unto a hungry jade,
only to keep him in life. He freeed not their rivers, nor fought not with
their enemy, but went his way, leaving them, in a manner in as desperate estate
as he found them.

The like he did at Roan, in neither place so much as once aduenturing to
fight for their sakes, which was not so much in diffidence of his force, as
that he meant not with Spanish blood to purchase the victory, leaving the
Frenchmen rather to iustle one against an other, to the end that he might
tread upon both parties when they were down. Which being by the wisest of
the Leaguers perceived, as Vytry, Vilroy, Grillion, etc. they abandoned him
utterly, betaking them to the service of their own true and lawful Kings.
Sundry other of them have done the like, and in a manner all, except some few,
who draw still backward rather through the terror of their own dispairing
conscience than in any hope of good success, or fortunate event.

Here now you see, that this French League and society of his has not
been, nor is not unto him of any avail, but rather of great detriment,
burden and expense.

The king of Spain and the Princes of Italy, in diffidence one of an other.
As for the Princes of Italy, what fair weather soever they do bear him; he
neither trusts them, nor they him, and the pretenses of the one, and the
estates of the other considered, neither of them both is without reason; and
withal, this malediction hangs over the head of him and his Nation, that as
he is of all foreign Nations distrusted, doubted, and abhorred, so both he and
the very name of a Spaniard, is unto the rest of his own subjects most
loathsome and hateful; insomuch, that in Millan the young Gentlemen amongst
many other pastimes, count that which they do call Caccia marrani not to be
the meanest, which is by putting on visards upon their faces by night, A
pastime of the young Gentlemen of Millaine which they do call Caccia Marrani.
to go with their rapiers, or good piked bastinadoes under their clokes, out
into the town to seek Spaniards, in the Stews, or any other place, where
they are likely to find any of them, and there to give them as many stabbes
and blows as they can lay upon them; insomuch, that the Spaniards dare not
for their ears abide out of the Castle after the shutting in of the gates.

The hatred of the Netherlanders to the Spaniards.
Neither is the affection of the poor Netherlanders better toward them, who
as their usage has been harder, so is their desire of revenge greater;
insomuch, that whenever any Spaniard falls into their hands straggling from
the army, or otherwise, he is assured to endure as much cruelty, as their best
invention can add unto the extremity of their hatred, some they have whipped
to death, others they have mangled with lingering torments, and some they have
buried alive in the ground, leaving nothing out but their heads, at which they
have bowled matches, never leaving till they saw their bowls imbrewed with
their brains.

The cruelty of the Spaniards to the west Indians, and of the hatred in the
which they live.
As for the poor west Indians, of whom at their first arrival they were
honored as gods, after a small and short acquaintance with their customs,
humors and cruelties they were so deeply and dispairefully detested, that
there was nothing more usual, than to see those poor wretches by great
companies to get themselves to the tops of rocks, and to tumble themselves
down headlong into the sea, others to cut their own throats with sharp
stones, some to pine themselves away with famine; yea, and women great with
child, some to take poison, and some to rippe open their own wombes, to the
end, to free themselves and their infants from the hateful conversation and
cruel government of those intolerable Spaniards, whose monstrous
inhumanitie, they deemed far more insufferable and unsociable than the raging
fury of lions, bears, or whatsoever bloody monsters.

I will not defile my pen with writing, nor your ears with hearing their
barbarous, naturelesse, and unmanly kinds of inhumanity exercised upon these
poor, desolate, miserable and distressed wretches, the whole world being
infected with the fame thereof.

The extremity of the Portugalles hatred toward the Spaniard.
But if you will thence throw your eyes upon the kingdom of Portugal, (a
Nation, civil, militaire, opulent and noble, with desire to see how he is
there loved, honored, and affected, you must consider, that in former times of
their happiness, liberty and freedom, there was never any hatred so settled,
deadly, and violent, as that which they bare unto the Spaniard, insomuch, that
if any one of them had but chanced to name a Castilian, he would presently have
spet (as the common sort usually do when they speak of the Devil to cleanse
his mouth after the pronouncing of so hateful a word: but being now constraind
to receive for masters, those that before they would not allow for honorable
enemies, nor ever use and entreat according to those militar rules that the
nobleness of war prescribes, as their battles of Alnibarota and Toro can
testify, wherein they suffered not any one prisoner to escape unslain.

Their hatred then being (as I said before) so great, that it could not well
be greater, you may imagine, that this their constrained slavery and servitude
has no whit at all amended their affection, especially being guilty too
themselves, that he has wroong himself into their estate, not by any justice
of election or lawful title of inheritance, but by an absolute injurious
usurpation, and forcible intruding violence, making the puissance of his army
supply the weakness of his title. And so contrary unto the testament and
ordinance of their last King, the Cardinal, and to the great scorn and
prejudice of all the other competitours, who were all agreede to stand to the
trial of justice, surprised them, and seized their estate, being unarmed and
utterly unprovided of all means of defense, attending nothing less than
violence, especially the title being undecided, and they wholly busied and
intentive about means to clear and discuss the same.

Finaly, being by violence possessed of the crown, he presently used the
authority of a Conqueror, and the tyrannical cruelty of an unjust usurper
altering their laws, The cruelty of the king of Spain in Portugal.
confounding their Privileges, and turning vpside down the whole estate of
their government. Their Nobility were some strangled, some beheaded, some
imprisoned, and some banished. Their religions men and Friars such as had in
the pulpit spoken for the liberty of their country, were pulled out of their
Cloisters, some murdered, some drowned in the river, and some beaten to death;
and finally, because there should be no kind of cruelty left unattempted, The
wife of Don Antonioes Agent, his daughters and mother in law, and three
Gentlewomen professed nuns of the order of S. Clare.
sundry Ladies of great account for being faithful and secret wives to their
husbands, were imprisoned, fettered, and banished with their dear and tender
children, without compassion of their sex or innocence.

Which tyrannical proceedings, if they were able to alienate minces otherwise
before well affected, what judge you would they then do, to those that were
already filled and possessed with the highest degree of hatred and enimitie?
Surely he is puissant enjoys many kingdoms and countries, but it has not
pleased God to bless him with the love and hearty affection of his subjects,
wherein consists the true beatitude of a Prince. Tyrants for the time
command the bodies of men, The true beatitude of a Prince consists in the
unfeigned love of his subjects
but only virtuous Princes enjoy the possession of their minds, which indeed
is a much more kingly, noble, and heroical domination for the one, every man
wishes his destruction, and gapeth after every occasion of alteration and
change: for the other, every man's eye watches, every man's heart prays, every
man's life and living is ready for their defense, as though all their lines, The
happiness of a virtuous Prince.
treasures and well-fares were in them alone included.

It is in a private man's estate, a thing comfortless, hateful, yea, and
dangerous too, not to be beloved, but (as they say) from the teeth outward of
those that serve and follow him, but much more in the greatness and dignity
of a Prince, who should be as a careful sheepeheard, to defend and preserve
his flock, as a loving father, zealously affecting the prosperity of his
subjects; and finally as the image and lieutenant of God shining over them with
his heavenly rays of virtue; bounty, clemency, piety, and justice, and not as
the Eagle and Lion, who being the kings of birds and beasts do maintain
themselves by the blood and destruction of their subjects.

In fine, it is to be wished, that it would please God of his goodness,
either to grant the King of Spain a better moderation in his greatness, or
else soon to bereave him of those means, through the confidence of which, his
ambitious greatness has set all Christendom in an vproare.

But leaving him here to his ambitious usurpations, cruelties, seuerities,
rigors, and iniustices; and his unfortunate subjects, to their enthralment,
vexation, The fortunate and blessed estate of England under the gou^rnement or
her Majesty.
slavery, slaughter, and bondage: let us from this hell of miseries cast back
our eyes upon that heaven of blissefulnesse which we do enjoy at home, under
the fortunate and happy government of our most excellent and incomperable
sovereign; there we shall find an other estate of matters, all things
flowing in plenty, peace, comfort, quietness, pleasure, and tranquillity. Her
Realm copiously abounding in men of warrelike disposition, of whom, as she
is outwardly reverenced and obeyed, so she is inwardly unfeignedly loved and
adored; her wars are just, charitable, and defensive, for maintenance of the
which, besides the trust that she reposeth in God; she is allied in strait
league, friendship, and confederated with the most victorious and christian
king of France with the Kings of Scotland, and Denmark with the Swissers, and
with sundry princes and estates of the empire, most of them being her
neighbors, and their dominions united, or not far distant from hers, and
thereby ready to assist, aid, and succor one an other in all such occasions
as shall or may happen.

She like a princely, zealous, and loving mother carefully tendereth,
fostereth, and preserves, her subjects by wisdom and fortitude from foreign
violences; and by clemency, religion, and justice, from inward mischiefs.

If on the other side you desire to know how her subiets stand affected toward
her, A most apparent proof that her Majesty has a sure possession even of the
very hearts and inward affections of her subjects.
mark then the manner and behavior of the people, when as you see a traitor
going to his arraignement or execution, which though it be a case of
compassion, and moving the minds of men to commiserate the calamitous estate
of those unfortunate wretches: yet such is the ardent love they bear to her
Majesty, the jealousy of her safety, and the hatred to her enmies, that many
times they are hardly restrained by the officers from doing violence to the
prisoners on the way, and whereas they do usually accompany all other kind
of malefactors to their deaths with a kind of feeling sorrow and compassion,
they do then no other thing but curse, banne, and revile these with all the
most approbrious speeches they can invent; yea, and commonly applaude the
instant of their deaths, with a general showt of joy, with some such cry or
other, as; God save the queen, and confound all traitors, flattery this can
not be, nor hope of reward, being confusedly done by thousands of unknown
people, much less fear of correction; for silence is unpunished. No no, it is
no constrained fear, Not fear but affection must sway the minds of a
multitude.
but a voluntary affection that must sway in this sort the minds of a
multitude.

Upon the death of king Edward the fourth the Duke of Buckingham made an
eloquent Oration in the Guilde hall, flattering the Mayor and his brothers, and
promising them many goodly matters and golden days, in the behalf of king
Richard the tyrant. The assembly seeing there was no remedy to prevent the
intended mischief, did him reverence with their bodies, but with sorrowful
faces, and silent tongues: insomuch, that the Duke rebuked their silence, and
began his excellent premeditated tale again, half threatening, half begging
an applause, but it would not be: not any one that would open his lips to
cry, King Richard, except a few of his own lackies at the nether end of
the Hall; so that (as I say) howsoever their bodies may, the minds of men can
never be constrained. Blessed therefore and glorious is the domination of her
Majesty the which so happily and fully possesses, not only the exterior
service of her subjects bodies, but also the interior fidelity of their minds.

I cannot here omit to speak a word or two, as well of the worthiness and
loyalty of those honorable gentlemen of her Majesty's Court, The honorable
offer of certain worthy Gentlemen of the Court made unto her Majesty.
who upon the approach of the Spanish fleet, presented, not only their persons
and lives for the defense of her Ma. but also a great portion and yearly
revenue of their lands; as also of her Majesty's great benignity and gracious
answer, telling them, That she accounted her self rich enough, And her most
princely and gracious answer made unto them again.
in that she possessed such subjects, assuring them, that for her part, she
would spend the last penny of her treasures for their defense, rather than she
would be burthenous unto them: O happy people in such a Princess, and happy
Princess in such a people; here is a well tuned music, an agreeing concord
and perfect harmony of government, where the frankenesse of voluntary
affection draws from men the effects of duty, and not the baseness of
servile and constrained fear.

Let atheists and traitors breathe out their bootelesse blasphemies, and
inueigh, impugn and malign against the flourishing happiness of our estate:
and let them turn themselves to all the malicious practices they can: the end
of all their wicked endeavors, will be (like Erisicthon that dared presume to
lay his profane axe upon the holy tree of Ceres, to starve, languish, and
pine away with a self consuming disease of envy and despair.

As for these that are virtuous and wise, they can not, but in the infinitenes
of our blessings acknowledge the mighty and apparent hand of God, which surely
cannot be casual or attributed to the politic industry of man, but merely
to the mightiness of Gods merciful working, and to his long and eternal
fore-appointed ordinance.

In fine, to come to the conclusion of this point, you see that her Majesty is
protected by God, confederated and linked in friendship and alliance with
mighty Kings and Princes, that she commands a populous and manly Nation,
that her wars are virtuous, just and lawful; and finally, her successes
fortunate and prosperous.

This then being considered, I see no reason, why you or any man else should be
so apprehensiue of that terror wherewith the Spanish Brokers; do daily
endeavor to dismay the courages of our countrymen.

If it be through doubt, that our Nation is not equal unto the Spaniard in
force of arms and valor of courage, I can not judge of him that shall so
conceive as of a true English man borne, but as of a degenerate, bastardly, and
adulterine plant, guilty to his own mind of an inward self feeling
cowardice: and finally, worthy of that enthralled slavery, under which many of
our falsehearted countrymen do groan and languish, as one that through the
disease, infection, and unsoundness of his own corrupted mind is not able
for to take the true taste and relish of his own native Country virtues. Sore
eyes can not endure the Sun beams, nor false hateful minds never harbor
true or noble minds and affections. The Poet says:

To him that loves, each foul thing seems fair: And so by contrary;

To him that hates, each fair thing seems foul. If such would but read the
Chronicles, as well of ours as other nations, they should find, that a small
army of English men, under the conduct of that worthy and magnanimous Prince
of Wales, The memorable and famous battle of Nadres obtained by th Englishmen
in Spain under the conduct of the black Prince
eldest son to King Edward the third, passed in despite of them through
Navarre into Spain, and there, even in the midst and bowels of their own
country, overthrew at Nadres their usurping king Henry the bastard (of whose
race this man is descended by his grandmother) being accompanied with the
nobility of their country, and three score thousand of the brauest fighting
men in Spain, and so utterly overthrew him, that they erected in his place Don
Pedro their just and lawful Prince of that kingdom, compelling, and by maine
force constraining the nobilite and Cities to receive him. There they may
likewise read the valourous conquests archieued by John Duke of Lancaster
brother to the said Prince in Galicia against Don John, John Duke of Lancaster
victorious in Galicia.
son of the said Henry the usurping bastard: besides, the Chronicles of
Portugal are full of the martial prowess of the English men, and glorious
victories obtained in service of their King, At the battle of Alaibereth.
to whose aid they were called against the said king of Castile.

But what need I run back into the passed ages, to seek examples? Look but
into the incounters that have been of late days between them and us either
by sea or by land, and you shall find that we have always carried the
victory, and they blows. As, by land, at the encounter of Grave, and that of
Zutphen, where the honor of the world and ornament of England sir Phillip
Sidney by his aduenturous valor was slain, besides many other bickerings and
skirmishes of less moment needelesse to recite.

Of sea matters I do count it bootelesse for to speak so greatly; and above
measure glorious is the same, and bruited throughout the world of the worthy
voyages of sir Frauncis Drake, sir John Hawkins, sir Martine Frobysher,
Captain Ryman, the Fennors and the rest of the brave and courageous Gentlemen,
who for the benefit of their country have not spared to make adventure of
their lives and fortunes.

But if you desire one example of all, let that then serve of his huge late
fleet, with the which Golyas-like he threatened heaven and earth, and, with
the which he thought to have circumuented and surprised at unawares her
Majesty, whilst falsely, wickedly, and abusiuely he entertained her
Majesty's Commissioners in Flaunders, with a treaty of peace: to which her
Highness like unto a christian Princess, and for to anoyde the effusion of
christian blood, was very inclineable; but God, as he has always done, so
at this time did he miraculously protect her Majesty in such sort, that
through the great careful and valorous resolution of the Lord high Admiral
of England, and the rest of his noble and courageous followers, they were with
a small number of English ships so fiercely and vigorously encountered, that
their resistance not prevailing them, they were scattered, chaced and utterly
discomfited, in such sort as the whole world knows, so that Lucans verse
which in those days he wrote to the glory of our Nation, vpbraiding the
Romans cowardice, may to none better be applied (in my judgment) than unto
them.

Territa quaesitis ostendunt terga Printannis. Besides, what better trial can
you have of the valor of either Nation than this; they being thirty thousand,
the cream of all their forces, and about the assembling of which he had been
above three years busied, yet when they came upon the coast of England, dared
not to land a man, whereas we the next year following, with a little navy,
containing not above eleven thousand men, under the conduct of the two
renowned Captains, sir John Norris, and sir Frauncis Drake, landed in Spain,
burned his ships, put his people to the sword, and his Towns to the fire,
and coasted thence along into Portugal, and there landing, marched in his
country, even to his gates of Lisbone, with drums sounding, and with
ensigns displayed; from whence we returned unfought withal by any of his
forces, by sea or land.

These things well considered, me thinks you have greater reason to hope one
day to see English ensigns displayed in Madrill, together with the utter ruin
of this aspiring tyrant, and al his followers and partisians, than any way to
sear him and his proceedings. And yet there is one point besides all the above
rehearsed, out of which we may receive singular comfort, as that which of all
other most deeply vexes and afflicts his cogitations, and which (not doubt)
before it be long, will give us a great advantage against him, and that is, the
contention which he sees to spring up in his own house, of which I will
briefly discourse unto you the occasions, because ye shall understand the same
the better.

His eldest and on^l son Don Philip by Anne of Austria daughter to Maximilian
the second.
He has by several wives three children living, two daughters, and one son,
the son young of years, pale, and weak of complexion, and not of the greatest
viuacitie of spirit, though the same according to the course of the world, is
by the common sort much covered under the high dignity of a Prince.

His eldest daughter Donna Isabella by Mad^m Isabel the eldest daughter to
Henry the second King of France.
His eldest daughter whom they call la infanta of Spain, a woman, as by birth
great, so proud exceedingly, haughty minded, and above measure aspiring,
prudent in her speeches, maiesticall in her actions and countenance, an above
her sex, manly and courageous: her he has always nourished under his own
wing, acquainting her even from her cradle with matters of state and
government. In which now, by reason of her long experience therein, she is
exceedingly practiced and ripe; with her what weighty matter soever he
undertakes, he participateth the same, before demanding her advice and
counsel, spending sometimes whole half days they two in communication
together; upon her (the youth and imbecillitie of the young Prince considered)
are the eyes of all men thrown, upon her depend the nobility, gentlemen, and
commons, and innumerable troops of surers, into whose hearts she has so
insinuated hirselfe, that they bear an exceeding love and reverence toward
her, many mighty men have been offered her in marriage, as the emperor
Rodolph, the Cardinal of Austria, and diverse other; but she will abandon Spain
for none of them al, til she see what will become of her father, whom she sees
old, oppressed with infinite cares, and not likely long to live, upon whose
death, her actions and manner of life does assuredly show that she is not of
metal to give place to the young Prince her brother, but at least she means
to part stakes with him.

In Spain she knows there is no law Salike to bridle her ambitious thoughts,
but women may succeed as well as men, for so did her great grandmother Iuana
to Ferdinando her father, and Isabella wife to Ferdinand to Don Henryques her
brother; having these examples before her eyes, she feeds her mind with high
and ambitious desires, of which her pretense she has made so clear and
evident demonst^ations, that her father, to prevent this mischief the which
he fears, he was forced, nor long since to assemble and gather the whole
Estates of Spain, and to make them swear to be true to his son, When her
father was sick some three years since, and the D. of Sauoy sent for into
Spain, she had so wrought, that by her fathers testament, she was ordained to
be gouernesse of Spain and protectresse of the Prince her brother.
whom he presently caused to keep his Court apart, sending him sundry of his
counsel, and commanding the Nobility to be attendaunt on him, acquainting
him, as much as in him lies, with the mannaging of matters of weight and
government: besides, it was a while bruited for certain, that the President
of Artoys, Richardo, whom the Duke of Parma had sent into Spain, to make his
excuses and iustifications against certain points of treason, of which he
was by the Duke of Pastrana and the Prince of As^oly accused to the King upon
his return had commission to assemble the nobility and states of the Low
Countries, and to cause them to take the like oathe unto his son, thereby to
prevent as well his daughter, as the Duke of Parma of their conceived hopes;
but whatsoever the cause was, the same was not effected.

His second daughter by the daughter of France. Donna Katalina married to the
Duke of Sauoy.
But now to come unto his second daughter, whom he has long time since
bestowed in marriage upon Charles Emanuel the Duke of Sauoy, with absolute
promise and solemn vow betwixt him and her, to leave her a kingdom for her
dowry. She is a Princess in ambition and high desire, nothing unequal to
her sister, but in wit and courage very far her inferior. She and her
husband both already take upon them in their manner, style and usage, a state
and title far beyond their dignity, convenient only unto Kings; Altezza is
the meanest phrase that they will be spoken in unto, Altezza Highness.
refusing any Letters that are not so entitled; for such is the will and
pleasure of the King her father. Naples and the Duchy of Millaine they have
already devoured in their hopes, which if her father at his death leave not
quietly unto them, they will be so bold as to strain courtesy with his
son, to get them perforce (if they can;) on the other side, the States of
Italy like not such a mighty neighbor amongst them: and therefore to
prevent both him and his father in fathers desseignement have made a most
straight secret league and alliance amongst themselves, terming the same,
ragione de stato: in the which are comprised, the Pope, the Venetians, The
Princes of Italy in league.
the Duke of Florence, the Dukes of Vrbyne, Mantua, and Ferrara.

The Duke of Parma in his life time dared not to enter in among them, but was
forced though none more agreeued to dissemble and temporize for a while, he
knew right well that the king had been exceeding jealous of him, and did
seek, though slily and dissemblingly, his life, honor and reputation. What
his son the new Duke will do when occasion shall serve, the Lord only
knows, but certain it is, that the detention of Portugal, to which he
persuades himself to have right: manet alta mente repostum, sticks deep in
his stomach; The duke of Parma and his coffeehouse.
and surely when as opportunity shall be presented, it is thought he will
make the world witness of his coffeehouse.

But leaving these things to their event, and the better discussion of these
points at which I have but lightly glaunced to men of greater ability, having
already exceeded the limits which I did at the beginning of this discourse
proportion to my self, it is now ^ime that I restrain my pen, concluding,
that the fame of the King of Spain is greater than his force; The fame of the
king of Spain exceeds his force
and he not better to be likened than to a shadow, which seeming long toward
the setting of the sun, yields to our sight a deceitful proportion of his
greatness. The Philosophers hold, that there is in all things, a beginning, a
progress, a state, and a declining, and that the perfecter their creation and
beginning is, the more are they durable, and longer ere they come unto their
period. And so contrary; if their beginning be corrupt and unsound, it is
improbable and impossible, that there should be any long continuance; which
argument, if it be as it is, infallible, then what shall we expect of this
mass of kingdoms which the King of Spain and his late predecessors have
hudled together by extortion, intrusion of himself, extrusion of others,
violence, injustice, and most of them by forcible usurpation; but that one day,
when opportunity shall serve, every bird will claim his own feather, and leave
him or his heirs naked? In the mean time (as I said before) in regard of
his many yrons in the fire, the disioyned situation of his own provinces, and
lastly, the general hatred that the world bears him, he ^s nothing so
formidable as he seems.

But by the way, I would not have any man mistake me, in this extenuation of
his mightiness, as though I should do the same to lull us asleep in
security, for there is nothing more dangerous than a contemned enemy; let us
rather do like well disciplined soldiers that keep still good and wary
watch, though they be never so far from the enemy.

I do not think that the Devil has so many horns in his head, and stings
in his tail, as he is painted withal: yet nevertheless I think him to be
very ill fauouredly faced, and a dangerous companion, and able to do much hurt
if a man do come within the compass of his claws. It is an old saying,
Frugalitie is the mother of Liberality, and Wariness of Security. Let not us
of our part be defective in contributing our goods, or hazarding our purses
for the public weal of our Country, than which, nothing is more honorable.
Neither let us grow confident and careless, in that of late since the
overthrow of his last fleet, he has not attempted any new invasion, but
assure our selves, that he fetches his blow the further, because he would
strike the surer. The Dutchmen have a proverb, that when the Spaniard sleeps,
the devil rocks the Cradle. Let us therefore be in a readiness for him against
he awake, the which undoubtedly we shall be, and that to his disadvantage, if
we will fear God, obey her Majesty, and be true within our selves; from which
union whosoever shall dismember himself, God send him speedy amendment, or
else, as he deserves, soon confusion. I know this discourse of mine shall be
diversely censured of, according to the diversity of their affections that
shall chance for to read it, but that request which I did make in the
beginning, I turn in the end now to reuiew, the which is to entreat those
that shall peruse it, not to bring with them any settled fore-ingrafted opinion,
but vnclothing their minds and affections of all partiality to judge thereof
accordingly as the truth of the matter, and the sincerenesse of my meaning
deserves.

Let them only wince, that feel their galled back rubbed (for my part) I
would to God, and I wish it unfeignedly, that this poor advertisement of mine,
might leave as a cataplasme or medicine to remedy and cure the rankleing of
their malladie and disease, the which if it may not be, but that in recompense
of my friendly, honest, and charitable intention, they shall reward me with a
malicious and detracting censure, I shall not therewith be much grieved, but
rather greatly comforted, in having made my self worthy of their malice, the
which seeing they have not spared to power out in such opprobrious terms
against Princes and men of aucthority, it were folly in me to think to escape
it, or want of courage to regard it.

As for the truth of these things which I have touched I give them free
liberty and scope to impugn it if they can; nay rather, I wish with my heart,
that they could disprooue it, and that my writings might be condemned as
false, so their actions might be justified as innocent, and that therein my
Country might not with the vyper have cause to complain of the too much
fertility of her womb, and the unnaturalness of her own fruit.

But lastly now to you for whose behoof I do chiefly take these pains,
whereas you do write, that if so be there were no other benefit to be gotten
in those parts, but attaining the language of foreign Nations, with the
knowledge of military discipline, and the state of the world abroad, wherein
you hear, that even my self and others your Countrymen have somewhat, it
were a motion sufficient, not only to make you leave your Country for a time,
but also to hazard your self to any dangers in foreign parts, I have thought
it good, therein to let you understand, that howsoever I, or any other have
profited therein, yet as the time does now serve, and the case now stands at
this present, there is no possibility that you or any other may, in far
longer time than I have spent, attain to the like. And if you could, yet the
dangers that in aduenturing the same you shall endure, were far greater than
the benefits you could possible reap, might in any wise counteruaile, were
they such as might answer your expectation; in which respect I pray you first
consider, that when I came first over thither, the wars then there undertaken
seemed, and were in appearance to all the meaner sort of men in the world, but
inrestine wars between the king and his subjects, such as neither foreign
prince, and most especially our most noble Queen and Sovereign was therein
nothing interessed, whereas since it has been made manifest to the world,
that these wars and injuries offered by the King of Spain unto those of the
Low Countries, whose laws, customs, and privileges he has most violently,
tyrannously, wrongfully and periuredly broken, has freed them from his
subjection, yoke and tyranny, and justly, and deservedly for ever caused him to
lose all such preheminences, prerogatives, authority and jurisdiction as he
pretended over them, as more amply appears in the ancient Records of the
privileges of these Nations, which both he and his predecessors at every entry
of government into these provinces have solemnly vowed and sworn to
maintain all in general, and every one in particular inuiolate; and upon
that covenant and condition, they have reciprocally sworn unto him due
fidelity and obeisance he failing in the one, they to be exempted from the
other.

Moreover her Majesty seeing the lamentable and most pitiful cause of her
distressed neighbors and allies, finding no other possible means by labor,
suites, messages, and sundry Ambassadors which she most honorably sent unto
the King of Spain for pacifying the said troubles, and reconciling the said
King, and those sometimes his said subjects has been enforced to take pity
and commiseration of their most miserable and afflicted estate and distress,
and for their relief, to her excessive and almost importable charges, to
undertake a most just, godly, and charitable defensive war against those that
daily seek the blood, lives, goods, lands, and liberties of the inhabitants of
the said distressed Nations, since which being published, I think it not only
unlawful, but a most heinous and capital crime and offense for any of her
Majesty's subjects to serve on the contrary part.

It shall be good for you and all other good subjects of her Majesty's to
remember, that consideration being had by her Majesty and her most honorable
prudent council, of the looseness of many of her subjects, and small respect
they had to her Highness and country, and as little to their own safety,
her Majesty has caused to be published and set forth diverse laws,
ordinances, proclamations and inhibitions, whereby all her subjects (except
known merchants and strangers are straightly forbidden to pass the seas into
any foreign parts without especial license of her Majesty. Therefore if you
or any other of her Majesty's subjects, shall now attempt to pass the seas
without lawful license, there is no reason why you should expect any other
than the rigor of the laws and justice, and to be holden guilty of cases
capital, especially such as shall serve under so open and professed an enemy
to the crown and state.

Further, I pray you to have in consideration, that when I came over hither,
the case so stood, as al Gentlemen of any quality or merit, were gratefully
received, and employed in good and honorable services; whereas since the
Spaniard has professed himself an open enemy to her Majesty and the state of
her realm, he has had all English men in very base account, being jealous
and extremely suspicious of those that be most inward with him, and who for
his sake have make shipwreck, not only of their honor and credit, but also
of their loyalty, duty, and allegiance to her Majesty and their native
country; examples whereof are infinite, and partly touched in my discourse
before set down.

Besides, there is of late crept into that Nation with a commanding
authority, a proud; insolent; and factious company of Jesuits, and with them
a consorted crew of other practicing busy people, all of them malicious
enemies to her Majesty, and to their own country, vile and pernicious
instruments of the Spansh King and his adherents, who daily (as it is manifest
to them that have knowledge and experience of them and their actions) seek
nothing more, than the utter ruin, pulling down, and destruction of her
Majesty and their country: He therefore that does think to live among these
subtle and dangerous people, in any credit or account, let him, as he
woorthily does deserve, be accounted beside his wits, or else as disobedient
and traitorous to almighty God, her Majesty, and his country.

As for my part, howsoever in my young years affected to learn languages, and
to see the wars and fashions of foreign places, yet when I perceived that
the matter began to concern her Majesty, and withal, to look into the
drift and conueyance whereto their practices tended, presently abandoning and
utterly rejecting the merit of my long service, and such hopes and
preferrements the which I might as well as any man else of my quality of my
Nation have pretended, and perchance should as soon have obtained, I made
humble intercession to her Majesty my most honored princess and sovereign
Lady for my return, which of her royal and accustomed benignity she
graciously granted: so that besides the unfeigned prayer which I will never
cease to send to the heavens from the depth of a most faithful affection for
the continuance of her blessed estate and happiness, I take God to record,
that there is not in this world any thing that I more thirst after than an
occasion to make the world witness of the desire I have to do her service; and
so concluding, I beseech God, that as her virtues are infinite, so her joys may
be endless. Amen.

THE COPY OF A Letter sent out of the Low countries by a Gentleman entertained
by the King of Spain in pension: To a young Gentleman his Kinsman in ENGLAND.
MY very good Cousin, understanding as well by your Letters, as by the message
lately done unto me by the mouth of A. T. of the great longing and desire you
have to draw your self into these parts, and to employ your self here in
service of the Spanish king: and perceiving also as well by your said Letters,
as by the Gentleman that brought the same, and by the report of diverse other
young Gentlemen of our Country, there be many that are of your mind in that
point: Some thereunto, as I do guess, moved of a youthful and vain tickling
humor, to be wandering abroad in strange and foreign Countries: Others in
hope there to grow to great preferment, advancement, employment, and wealth:
Other some pretending matter of conscience, seem to have sure confidence, that
there they may live with more liberty and ease of mind, then that within our
Country they inioye. I have thought good for the particular love which I
bear, and always have borne toward you, unto whom I wish as to my self,
but chiefly in respect of the sincere, faithful, reverent, and loyal
fidelitye and regard I have to the person of our sacred, renowned, and most
gracious Sovereign, the QVEENES most excellent Majesty, and to my native
Country and Countrye-men, to set down some notes and observations, which
by long and painful troubles and experience in this place I have gathered: by
which I hope I shall make manifest not only to you, but also to all others my
most dear Country men, if I may have the favor to have it published: in
which point I mean to labor by my best friends, to such of the greatest
persons as may permit the same, how greatly you and they that desire to repair
hither by any of the motions before expressed, or in any hope of good to be
received from they said King, do err and are deceived. I heartely and most
earnestly desire you, and all other that shall read the same, deeplye to judge
and consider of these points which I shall set down, which (God willing) I will
do with such fidelity, true meaning, and sincerity, as that no part of the
same shall be truly to be gainsayde or refelled, and my self by the persons,
times, and places, and other circumstances shall make most manifest and plain,
to any that shall doubt of the truth of the same or any part thereof, and I
shall take great joy and comfort, if my self having undertaken an vntowardlye
and dangerous course, though with better success then has happened to many
hundreds, may be as a caveat to all the young Gentlemen of our Nation, how they
hazard themselves so dangerously. And that my painful experience may be to
you as a looking Glass, wherein they may behold the spots and errors of their
conceived fancies, or as marks set up for them, whereby they may avoid the
perilles and most dangerous rocks and shelfes, to them yet unknown, and
lying hidden under the smooth, fair, and delighful conceived and fantasied
pleasures forged in their imaginations.

THE METHOD OF the ensuing Discourse.
THE method and manner that I intend to use in this Discourse, shall be after
this sort. First, I will direct my speeches to the unexperienced Gentlemen,
desirous to serve here in Spain, showing them in what point of their hope and
expectations they do fail and are deceived.

Secondly, to our credulous Papists at home, upon whose grosenesse and
simplicity, our rebellious traitors here abroad do build their chiefest
foundations of all their villainies, whom while they entertain with vain
expectations, in the mean time with spies, Priests, and traitors, which they
daily send over, they abuse with treacherous practices, to the irrepiable ruin
and overthrow of them and theirs. Thirdly, because many of our country men
living in great happiness at home, do yet in their conceits mislike,
surfeiting with ease, the blessed estate they live in, and what withal, the
manner of her Majesty's most gracious and merciful government, I have thought
it my duty somewhat to express these few things which have come to my
knowledge, touching the innumerable benefits and blessings with which it has
pleased God to adorn her royal Majesty, together with the flourishing estate
of that noble soil, since the time of her Majesty's reign, so flourishing
with peace, prosperity, and abundance in glory of wars, so renowned and
victorious in arts, so curious and excellent in justice, even to the very
enemy, so admirable, and (which surpasses all the rest) in the free, sweet,
and comfortable use of the true religion: so above all others blessed and
fortunate, that I have heard the very Spaniardes themselves say, they fear
Jesus Christ is become a protestant. Withal, I make some comparison between
this and the tyrannical government of the Spanish tyrant, his cruel and
inhumane usage of his miserable subjects, their abolition of their privileges,
and in fine, the unspeakable bondage, slavery, and desolate despair in which
they live languishing. A matter though far unfit for me to handle or treat,
but worthy of the most grave and experienced men of quality and highest
degree, yet considering I shall not presume to treat of matters of high state
or secrets, but such as every good subject may find and pick out of the
heroical actions of the one, and the tyrannical insolence of the other, both
don in the appearance of the world, I hope and so with all lowlynesse most
humbly desire her gracious and most benign Majesty to pardon me, if I come
far short of that which men fitter for the handling thereof could say or
entreat. And so most humbly also make petition, that I may therein be censured
according to the loiall zeal I bear to her most princely Majesty, and not to
the baseness and simplicity of my style or the handling thereof.

But to come to my Discourse, to the end that you and the rest of your opinion,
may clearly and plainly discern those things which hitherto your eyes blinded
with the veil of partiality, have not bin able to view: I will begin with the
good usage, honor and advancement that you and other Gentlemen addicted to this
service are here to expect, bringing unto you for example, sundry brave and
worthy Gentlemen, Captains, and soldiers, that have taken the like course
before you, whereby you shall perceive it is not all gold that glistreth, but
that whatsoever show the Spaniard makes unto us, yet in his heart he mortally
abhors us, and by all means possible seeks our destruction, ruin, and
subuertion, as it evidently appears by his usage of troops and companies of
our nation that have served his. For example: at the siege of Antwarpe there
came unto him under the conduct of Norris and Cornish, a troup of six thousand,
the tallest and best appointed soldiers, that ever I remember to have seen in
all my life, their coming being the only cause that the town was so soon
delivered unto him as it was. For whereas the Duke of Aniou lay under the
walls of Gaunt, with sufficient force and most deliberate resolution to
succor the said town of Antwarpe upon his mutiny, fearing further
inconvenience, he marched away with his whole camp, leaving the enemy now
battering the town, who seeing themselves frustrate of their expected hope,
presently rendered the same to the Duke of Parma. But how were they
recompensed? Within one year they were l^^ all to ^am^^h for hunger, which
some of them seeking to relieve, by foreranging out upon the Country, four
and twenty of them were taken and carried to Antwarpe, of whose beginning they
were the chiefest, and there openly hanged in the market place. Whereas all
other nations had liberty to rob and steal, and do what they list. Another
troop of them of thirty, being forth, and lying in a village near
Poppering in Flanders, a company of Spaniards hearing of them, came into the
village where they were, and after friendly and souldierlye salutation of each
side, as they were all making merry together, on a sudden the Spapiardes
took them at advantage unarmed, and most trecherously and inhumanely
murdered them every one. Sundry complaints were made to the Duke by the
friends of those that were thus murdered, and by the Captains of the
Regiment, but there could be no remedy nor justice obtained. But to make
amends, because they would be the cleanlier rid of the residue of this
poor miserable troop, the camp being then before Winockbergen, they made
them two little sorts of purpose, in which they willingly placed them in the
utmost quarter of the whole camp, and nearest confining to the town, to the
end they might have all their throats cut, as in deed they had very few
nights after. At which time the enemy assaulting them with great fury, and
they defending themselves most manfully above the space of an hour, in such
sort as the alarm passed through the whole camp, yet they were never relieved
with any succor at all, insomuch that the greatest part of them being slain
in defense, the enemy at last entered and put the residue to the sword.

To rehearse unto you the sundry and several calamities that these poor men,
as well Captains as soldiers endured, during the small time of that their
unfortunate service, especially at Ganskecke, Ask, and Grauer, would seem (I
am sure) unto you for the unspeakable strangeness thereof, scarcely credible,
for they never received all the time of their service any one months pay. I
have seen Lieutenants and Ensigns of them go up and down the camp begging
their bread, covered only with old mantles about their shoulders, and have my
self relieved some of them. Shortly after came Pigot, who brought with him sir
John Norris his regiment, being well near a thousand, as tall and well
appointed men as were in Europe, whose service, how meritorious and beneficial
it was unto the Spaniardes, I leave to their judgments that know the
Country. For by rendering of Alost unto him, they were the occasion that he
got Darmounde the Sasse, the fortes of Leiskins hook, Saint Anthonies, and
Saint Margarets, the best part of the land of Wast, and in manner Gaunt it
self, as the sequel showed. Notwithstanding all which service, they were
within two years space, what with hunger, the gallows, and rigorous dealing,
consumed and brought to nothing. And last at Stalbrooke, even against the
yielding up of Antwarp, when all other nations were to receive their count and
reckoning, they only were infamously cashierd without any one months pay.
And which of all other is most monstrous and scarce credible, whereas some of
the Captains, not long before had made them of their own purses new and fair
Ensigns, those Ensigns were violently taken away from those that bare them,
and detained: Which abuse and wrong, though captain Tresham and the other
Captains complained off to the Duke with great protestations, yet they could
never obtain any restitution.

Somewhat before this time, when the whole camp was at the siege of Dermound
paid two months, they only though of all others most traveled in the
trenches, wading every night bosom high to their wast, and having had more
men slain in that siege than any other regiment in the whole camp, could not
receive one penny, notwithstanding they had passed in muster with the rest,
and some of the Captains bribed the Commissarie, thinking thereby to make a
great hand. But in stead of money, when they showed the Duke, they were
scornfully by him turned of to the Contadores, of whom they received the most
base and opprobrious speeches that ever were given soldiers, and were in fine
rejected without ever receiving one halfpeny. And lastly, when the Regiment was
cast, whereas the pay of a reformed Captain amongst them, of what Nation
soever he be, is forty crowns, they give only to our English captains five
and twenty a month. Not long before it chanced that one of the Captains,
whose name was Edward Vincent, was taken in a skirmish by the enemy at
Pernence, and set at ransom at a hundred and fifty pounds, to make which
ransom, his father being then in Flanders, a poor old man of seventy years
of age, fell upon his knees before the Duke, weeping and imploring his help.
But in sted of yielding him relief, the Duke badde take away the old dronken
fool: the grief whereof struck the old man so to the heart, that he went home
and dyed within six days, and his son for lack of his ransom was shortly
after hanged at Perges. Pigot himself being some three years since taken, and
Barn, between Gaunt and Bruges, were never relieved with any one penny
toward their charges or raunsomes, Pigot was suffered miserably to end his
days in prison, and so had Barn also, but that his wife, by her solicitation,
found such favor among his private friends, that she got as much as paid his
ransom, but never could obtain one penny of the Duke, though she were an
importunate suitor unto him.

Lastly, came sir W. Standley and R. York rendering unto the King the town of
Deuenter, and fort of Sutphen, the one with a regiment of foot, the other with
a company of lances. Let us see how the one and the other was used. First, sir
William Standley was confirmed governor of the Town, he rendered, and his
regiment left there in garrison, with the receipt of two months pay. For a
while he lived in the greatest applause that might be: Cardinal Allen was
written to to send down Priests to instruct this religious regiment: he
informed the Pope thereof, who wrote jointly to the king to be good unto this
regiment. Which being well and liberally entreated, as they had already at
Rhemes and Rome, a Seminary of scholars to pray and write for the catholic
cause of our Country, so this conducted by so worthy and catholic a Gentleman
as sir William Standley was, might be a continual nursery, and seminary of
soldiers to fight for the same. Down came Priests thick and three fold,
from France and Italy, many Masses, and much preaching there was: Gentlemen
from all parts drew down thither, in hope of this good payment, and golden
world that the^ was talked of. But what followed? within short space, to weaken
then number, three of their companies under color of service, were cunningly
drawn out of the Town by Verdugo Haaltephen, never from that time after being
suffered to return to it again: and within a while after sir William him self
with the remnant, was commanded under the like color of service, to come
forth, being told that he should presently return into it again. And by
this fine means was cased of his government, and such goods as he and his
soldiers left, were spoiled and made booty of. And sithence that time, his
seminary soldiers, with all their religion, were never trusted in any town, nor
never shall be I warrant them. From thence they were presently drawn down into
Brabant, where they wintered in the field without money, and in such great
misery and poverty, that ten weeks together their chiefest food and
sustenaunce in Turnolt, was vnpoudered acornes, which they found in cellers.
Which diet the priests not liking of, came to their Coronell to Antwerpe, who
to avoid the lamentations and complaints of his soldiers, had gotten him there
a lodging, where you should never have found his table without a squadron of
Priests. Some did wonder, so worthy a soldier could suffer their indignities,
which to avoid, some years since he went into Spain: partlye to secure unto
himself some estate of living, of which he now considering this dealing, began
to doubt: partly by the inuitation of the Jesuits, with which order he is
exceedingly enchanted, and to the^ wholly subjected: who dealt for him in such
sort with the Cardinal, that he presently sent Parsons away into Spain, to
inform the King of his worthiness, virtue, and experience of the sea coasts
of England, but especially of his intelligence about Irelande, which in truth
he presumes to be very great. Parsons plaide his part in such sort, that
sir William was presently sent for: who upon his ariuall, did what he could, to
persuade the king to send forces for Ireland: but belyke there was not such
credit given him as he expected, insomuch that he wrote Letters to H. Holt
the Jesuit in Brusels (which is one of those on whom he chiefly relyeth) of
great discontentme^t, signifieng, that his entertainment was far colder than he
expected. Within short space after, he was sent down to the kings navy,
lying at Coconia where as yet he remains. In the mean time his regiment
began to drop and droupe away, in such sort, that what for lack of
sustenance, and what for ill usage, the number of them was melted to an hundred
and fifty: which base and villainous usage the grauest and wisest of his
Captains seeing, especially abhorring the treacherous practices of their
Coronell, made by secret means humble intercession to her most gracious
MAISTIE to pardon their offenses committed, and to grant them liberty to live
in their Country: which of her most princely and royal benignity she
granted, so as now they live here in honest and good sort, and can testify
all this which I have said to be true.

Having gotten sir William out of Deuenter, yet York still remained a blemish
in their eye, who alwais, notwithstanding their base usage, still flourished and
bare his head aloft, ranging over the whole country with his Company,
bringing in daily many great and rich booties: Him therefore fairly on a day
at dinner, they caused to be poisoned, where likewise were poisned with him
young Richard Souch, and Robert Fen priest: but he belike having swalowed the
best Boncon, they only met with the drams, so that he died miserably, and they
fell sick and brake out into many pustles and biles, yet afterward recovered,
and did give this testimony. His breath was no sooner out of his body, but
Fiorias a Spaniard, and Vandenberg, the new governor of Deuenter rushte into
his lodging to break up his coffers* in which being withstoode by Yorkes
lieutenant Edward Boncer, and his brother, they caused their gards at noone
days to enter in upon them, and to murder them both in their own presence:
which done, they brake up his coffers, took out his jewels, plate and money, of
which they found great store, appropriating the same to their towns use, which
he by Testament had given to a little youth his nephew, being now at this
present in England. Lastly, they chased his whole company out of the town,
and spoiled their baggage at the gates. The poor soldiers being thus
inhumanely deprived of their Captain and Lieutenant, and seeing them selves so
vilely dealt with, repaired to Verslugo for relief, who for recompense
presentlye cashierd them all without receipt of one penny.

Afterward they gave out and published, that York was poisoned by
subornation of the counsel of England: but, if there had been no other proofs
(as there were infinite) yet the sequel of their doings, their murdering of
his friends, and their robbing of his treasure, showed by whom it was done, and
whereat they aimed.

If these examples be not enough to serve the turn, but that perchance you
will say, he has dealt better with private men. If you can name me but any one
that he has raised or advanced to honor, or that lives richly or welthily in
his service, I will name you an hundred, that being Gentlemen of good houses
and of worthy merit, have consumed, languished, and been brought to nothing
in his service, some of them perished and died for lack of sustenance. You
perchance will name Hugh Owen: and in good faith he is the only man that ever
I knew advanced, credited, or graced in his service. And yet (God wot) all that
he gets, is no more than to maintain him in a mean estate and show, with
a man only or two to serve him. Where on the other side I will reckon you up
of those that are only for want of things necessary, and of pure poverty
consumed and dead, M. Copley, L. Dacers, Michael Tempest, old Norton, Tremaine,
Stradling, Henry Carew, Edward Allen, Southwell, with sundry others of good
race and credit in their Country: Copley being sick at Beuere, and in
unspeakable distress and calamity, desired a Gentleman his kinsman, one Lo.
Lewkner, to beseech Pedro de Olane, who then was treasurer, to pay him upon an
assignation which he had, only five pounds, protesting that at that present
his life might therewith be saved. The Gentleman performed his request with all
instance and fidelity, as he has oftentimes told me, but could not obtain
one penny. Whereupon he moved the Duke, but nothing would come, so that
without finding any man that took compassion of his distress, his own
Countrie-men being unable to help him, he ended his life, though with
patience virtuously and well, yet the state of so honorable a gentleman
considered, most pitifully, and in great misery.

To recite unto you the names of those that do yet live so poorly and
uncomfortably in his pension, would be too long, and therefore take them all
in general ( Charles Paget only excepted) and examine them one from an other,
from my Lord of Westmerland downward, even to the very lowest: and if there
be in the whole world a more miserable and discontented troop of Gentlemen
than they are, let me never be credited in any thing else that I shall tell you.
And because you shall your self the beteer judge, I will tell you what payment
they have, of such pensions as the king has given them.

They had granted them at Bruges the first day of August, in the year one
thousand five hundred eighty and eight, a general Liberanca, to receive three
months pay a piece of their pensions. Since that time they have followed the
Duke from Town to Town, making unto him sundry requests for the payment
thereof: but if they have until this present day obtained the same, then let
me not be credited in any part of the rest which I shall here entreat of. In
deed some small time past, Cosimo being wearyed with their importunities and
lame^tations, addressed the^ to Baptista Spinola a baker dwelling at Antwerp
giving them his Letter, and sending the same by one H. Haslwood, requesting him
to relieve those distressed English Gentlemen, and to buy their Liberanca,
which he doubted not but they would sell good cheap, greatly to his profit: the
whole sum was ten thousand crowns, which Cosimo promised him should be
allowed, and paid in the reckoning he had with the king. Haslewood in the name
of the rest, offered him the said sum for six hundred. But Spinola utterly
refused the same, saying, he would not take it for two hundred, and withal he
desired that he might not meddle any more with the king, wishing that he had
not meddled with him so much. So that they were fain to return pennilesse, and
do at this instant live in so poor and pitiful sort, that truly my heart
grieueth to see it, insomuch that I knew a Gentleman that sold his part there,
being four and twenty pounds, for three pounds. But perchance you will say,
he gives great pensions, and entertaineth many of our Nation: it is true in
deed, in show he does so, and therewith does bleare the worlds eyes with a
show of great liberality. But his payment and usage considered, a (God is my
judge and witness) I speak unfeignedly, I account it a far happier estate to
be a doorekeeper in that your blessed soil, than to be here pensioner to the
king of Spain. I leave the judgment of the truth thereof, to those that have
tried it: you have many amongst you, confer with them and examine them upon
their consciences: as for my part, in good faith I cannot imagine cause why he
entertaineth us, unless it be to use us as stales, to allure others, considering
the hatred that he and his bear us, and so under the dissembled color of a
false affection, to overthrow us all at the last.

Thus much I dare boldly say, because through the conference I have had with
them, I do know assuredly, that even those of our nation which do most serve
his turn, howsoever in outward appearance they seem for some particular causes
to magnify and extol his liberality, yet in their own secret conceits they
do imagine and know nothing in the world to be more reproachful, base, and
contemptible, than to be an Entertain do in the king of Spaines service. As for
example: you shall easily see what account is made of them. At such time as
preparation was made at Brussels for the voyage of England, when they all
expected to be made knights, coronels, captains, and conducters of the army,
and to be filled with crowns, they were so far from those matters with which
they flattered themselves, that in stead of being honored and advanced, they
were the only rejected and contemned people that followed the Court, all men
being relieved with some months pay (they only excepted) and which is more,
whereas they moved the Duke sundry times to know his pleasure, how he would
dispose of them in this journey, telling him besides, that upon the well usage
of them depended much matter of importance, as the alluring and drawing to
them other gentlemen of their kinsmen and friends, and upon hope of the like
good usage, honor, and advancement, would be able to do great service upon
their landing: where contrariwise, in seeing them come over so poor in show,
without credit, money, or arms, like lack is, for so were the words of their
request, it would be a cause to terrify them from undertaking any such course.
They were by the Duke scornefully and with derision rejected, neither did he
vouchsafe to give them any other answer, than only that he would think upon
it. But on the night that they thought to embarke, he departed, leaving them
all behind, not thinking them any way worthy to be called upon, or to be
taken with him. Whereupon the lord Westmerland and Paget, and sundry others,
laid their heads together, and made their complaint to the duke of Pastrana, by
whom they were as basely and scornfully handled as by the other, insomuch as a
great Spaniard standing by, asked them whether they thought the king of Spain
not puisant enough to win England, without them and their friends: Upon which
answer the Lord Paget, that verily thought he should have been made one of
the privy Council, and now finding himself to be had in so small account,
conceived such an inward grief, that for that time forward he never ioyed
till his dying day. Sir William Standley also took it in such heavy and
disdainefull sort, that he was not called to be counsel of wars, whereas he
presumed, and so gave out, that no man in the army knew more, or was better
able in this voyage than himself, that he sequestered himself from the Country,
and came malecontent, and hired an house in Antwerpe, where he lived a most
melancholy life four or five months, and oftentimes would burst out into such
impassionate speeches, that the world verily imagined he would have professed
himself into a cloister.

Besides, the love the Spaniarde bears us, appears by the speeches he
daily uses in public assemblyes concerning us. Once seeing certain
Englishmen pass by, as they stood a great many of them in a ring, (as they
use) together upon the bridge in Antwerpe, they said, They wondered what the
king made with such vermin in his country, one of them swearing a great oath,
that look how many Englishmen there were in the Low countries, there were so
many spies and traitors. Another said, it were an alms deed to put them all
in sackes, and throw them into the river. I could recite a thousand more such
speeches, but that they are not worth the remembering. They are so ielous and
suspicious of us, that if any thing prove untowardly in their service, they
think it straight to be done by our especial means and intelligence. As upon
the taking of Axhil by that brave and worthy soldier Sir Philip Sidney, of
worthy memory, Mondragon presently imprisoned Paget within the Castle, took
away all things whatsoever that he had worth any thing, and the rest he
caused his men to ryfle and steal, saying openly that we all are traitors and
spies. To confirm the confidence they have in us, tell me what companies of
English they have trusted within these ten years in garrison? I am sure you
cannot name one. And whereas sundry Gentlemen amongst us have instantly sued to
have their pensio^s granted them in the castle of Antwerpe or Gaunt, because
the payment is there somewhat better, no one has hitherto been able to attain
the same: so vile and base is the reckoning they make of us. I could allege
unto you many other exampls, of sundry disgraces offered unto our nation,
whereby we might (if we lust) easly discover the hatred they bear us, the
suspicion they have of us, and the danger wherein we stand, to have one day our
throats cut. But this I hope, which I have already rehearsed, shall suffice
fully to assure and persuade you, that here is no advancement, wealth, or
reputation to be gotten, but poverty, peril, jealousy, and disgrace.

Now let us see, touching the point of conscience, and repose in religion, if
the fame be to be found here, such as you expect. In matter of religion, I will
not take it upon me to dispute, because it were to digress from my purpose,
and besides, I never studied divinity: only making comparison between the
comfortable freedom of the one, and the dispayring slavery of the other:
laying of the one side Indulgences, pilgrimages, forged relikes, fabulous
devises, and auricular confessions: on the other side, the merits and passion
of our Savior Jesus Christ, the Invocation of his holy Name, and true
penitence proceeding from a contrite heart: on the one side men's traditions,
and on the other side, the sincere and holy word of our savior. In think the
choice is not hard to make for him whose heart is not hindered with obstinacy
and self will opinion. But leaving this, and allowing your religion to be
good, lets come to the contentment which you might here receive in free usage
of the same, together with the co^seruatio^ of such other your country men
which here do profess the same religion. First, I think you are not ignorant
of the broiles, divisions, seditions, and factions, which are here among them:
some they call Patriots, some Jesuits, some over negligent and careless in
religion, other some over pure and hypocritical, some dunces state men: but
the notablest of all these factions, is that, between our Cardinal Doctor
Allen, and D. Jews bishop of Casane: on these two parties are all dependant:
and so must you be also, if you were here, or otherwise cleaving to neither of
them, you should be counted enemy to them both, and so within short space
might put up your pipes, for ye should be sure to be put up for a spy, or at
least so to be crossed in all your matters and pretenses, that you would
quickly, I warant you, be weary of such entertaynment. On the other side,
embracing the one, what envy, what defamation, what slander should you not be
subject unto? On the other side, what oaths and solemn depositions must you
make? Finally, you would think there were no greater purgatory than to live
among these discentions, ^arres, and tumults. These two factions I tell you of,
have sought to overthrow one another^ credit in the chiefest courts in
Christendom, tossing to and fro such foul and filthy defamations, that all
men almost cried out against them both. On the other side of the Cardinal, are
dependant Hugh Owen, with the Jesuits and their retinue of favorites. On the
other side the Bishop of Dunglane a Scottish-man, the Lord Paget whilst he
lived, Charles Paget, Thomas Morgan, the two Throgmortons Ra. Liggins, etc. The
beginning hereof arose about the Cardinalshippe, to which both Allen and Jews
were competitours: each one for the obtaining thereof applied his friends to
the uttermost, but at length through the instant pursuit of the Jesuits, and
of their faction, were for ever after mortally hated, all those that had bin
ways or fautours to Doctor Jews, but chiefly and among the rest Thomas
Throgmorton, who had bin one of the earnestest in that pursuit. The Jesuits
since have had many a pluck at him, but Morgan being wise, strengthened
himself always with such friends, that they could never do him any hurt,
but rather secretly he galled them: the which they seeing, and peceyuing that
that was not the way to be revenged of him, they took another course, and
that was this: One evening as he came from the Church, they caused him to be
assaulted by a young man called Gage, who giving him on the sudden a grievous
blow upon the face, presently made haste away, and so for that time escaped,
but was afterward by my Lord Pagete means and earnest pursuit apprehended.
The Jesuits and their part seemed at the first to deny that they had been the
causers of that fact, but the sequel of their proceedings made it most
apparent unto the whole world. For when Morgan, my Lord Paget, and diverse of
their part, labored very instantly and with often petitions unto the Duke, to
have the rigor and severity of justice to proceed against him, of whom they
had received this great injury, they, to stop their mouths, and to prevent
the mischief that might ensue, found no better means than to accuse Morgan of
treason, laying to his charge sundry points of treachery touching the Queen of
Scotland. Besides, they accused him to have been a setter on of Gifford and his
assistances, in such practices as he had undertaken by sir Frances Walsinghams
warrant, and to that end sent Chryton, the Scottish Jesuit, to Paris, to take
Gyffords examination. And withal, they made some of their adherents to take
their oath before their Auditour general, that in their conscience they thought
Morgan to be a traitor and a spy: unto the taking of which oath also, they
labored earnestly with sundry others, which (they not having their consciences
so saleable as some of them) had refused and utterly denied to do: yet in the
mean time while these things were in hand, with their forged accusations they
wrought so, that Morgan was apprehended, and clapped up in close prison,
whereas yet he remains. But this broile has opened such foul matters, both
of the one side and of the other, that the whole Nation is therewith infamed,
and held to be traitors and spies: and in good faith, in my judgment, not
unworthily.

Good sir, take it not in ill part, that I write thus boldly unto you: for as
near as I can, my endeavor is to let you know, what hell, torment and vexation
it is to live here, among this unquiet, troublesome and traitorous crew. I
mean not this by them all, for there are among them some well disposed and
honest gentlemen, whom they use in such malicious and wicked sort,, that they
make them in a manner weary of their lives. But the pretiest of all is, to see
how smoothly they handle the matter with you in England, and how they do abuse
your simplicity. They make you and other Catholykes of England believe, that
what practices and driftes so ever they take in hand, are all for the zeal of
religion and advancement of the Catholic cause: and the seely souls think all
they say is Gospel, whereas (God wot) religion is the least matter of an
hundred they think upon. The only point they shoot at, being lost Companies at
home, is to make them selves great here, and to make you hazard your lives,
reputation and credit: and therefore they are alwais breeding of practices and
conspiracies both within and without the realm, caring not what success they
take: if they prove well, then they will have the praise, merit, honor and
reward thereof: if otherwise, then they say their good will must be accepted,
and therewith they think to win the reputation to be counted great
state-men, and contriuers of weighty matters: not caring in the mean time, of
the seueritye of them by whom they work, as appears by the example and fall
of many brave Gentlemen of England, whom they by their treacherous practices
have brought to ruin and destruction. They very well knew, that when they
first began to set abroach the matter of Babington and his disloyal
confederates, that the effectation thereof was altogether impossible, as Mendoza
the Spanish ambassador told Ballard the priest, their instrument in contriuing
the same, when he was first brought unto him in Paris by C. Paget, to desire
him with all speed to inform the Kings his master of their intention, and
withal, that at a day appointed they might have some force and assistaunce of
men ready to correspond with them: but that was all one, so they might be
counted men of great reach, and dealers in such high state matters, they
spared not to proceed in enchanting those poor unexperienced young Gentlemen,
in such forte, as to the whole world is manifest, and need not to be recited.
Let all Gentlemen in England, especially papists, take heed and beware of
their mischievous brood of caterpillars, for they speak so devoutly, look so
smoothly, and write with such counterfetted gravity and holiness, that it is
hard for any man to eschew their deadly baits, unless he thoroughly do first
know their treachery, under which they do color and shroude them. What has
brought master Shellie into these his extreme troubles and peril of life, if
her gracious Majesty of her great clemency and merciful disposition had not
regarded him with the eyes of pity? Likewise what has brought the late earl
of Northumberland into trouble and calamity, and finally to that desperate and
miserable end, but only these outlandish practices, and their conference with
counterfeit Mopo, I mean C. Paget, who was sent out of France by this seditious
troop, to undermine and overthrow both the one and the other? What besides
has been the cause of bringing so many other Gentlemen to the loss of their
lives and livings, that lived before in ease, repose, and security of
conscience: and which is more, were it not that that plot co^triued the death
of the Queen of Scotland, by setting her in continual practice one upon an
other, against the sacred person and royal state of our most gracious
sovereign Queen, so that of violent necessity, her Majesty though unwilling
and with great grief, at the general and instant petition of al her Graces
most loving and faithful subjects, whose only weal and comfort depends
upon her long life and prosperity, to satisfy them, and to preserve the state
of her noble and flourishing realm in quiet, was constrained by cutting off
that rankled and infected part, to yield ease, remedy and comfort to the rest
of the whole body. I say not this only of my self, though I and all the world
else do know it to be very true: but these their dealings have made them
hateful and detestable even to those of their own religion. For that a fresh
Jesuit terms them all in general in a Book, which he has written
touching the Queen of Scotlandes death, a viperous, mischievous, and
faithless kind of people, treacherous to those they deal withal,
disdainful, arrogant, ambitious, and worthy to be extermined out of the utmost
bounds of the world. Besides many other such goodly epethites, with which he
beautifies them in their colors, his whole book being nothing else but
railing against English papists, wishing all princes, noble men and Gentlemen
whatsoever, to beware and take heed of them: and that in such earnest,
vehement, and inuectiue manner, that it is not possible to be more.

But some man perchance may demand of me what their meaning herein may be,
or what credit, commodity or gain might have allured them to enter into
these before said, so wicked and detestable imaginations.

For aunsweare heereunto: first I told you, that so they might be accounted
and reputed for great state-men, high spirited, and great of action, to
procure that reputation and estimation they care not whose estate they
indaunger. But besides all this which we have already spoken of, they have
also further meaninges and driftes, as those that do look deepelyest and
diligentest into their actions, do verilye imagine, and have been by sundry
their proceedinges evidently discovered, amongst which the chiefest is, that
as they are of all people living the most ambitious, so seeing this beggarly
service does not fit their humor, they do feed themselves with an
imagination of the time to come, I mean a Spanish or popish world in this our
country, at which time then they doubt not, the long time of their exile,
sufferance, and lack of living considered (for so is their phrase and manner
of speech) to become mighty and great men, and to have the principal rule,
sway dignity, and great authority in our country. Marry again on the other
side, considering that they are but base companions of births and living, and
that there are in England many gentlemen of great quality and houses of the
same religion, that would disdain to have such mates preferred before the^ in
race, quality or degree: they have gone (by all means possible they can) about
by practice or colorable devises to root them out, so serving their turns
two ways: the one to win reputation of men of service: the other, to rid
themselves of other competitours. But (God be thanked) the chiefest harm their
conspiracies have done hitherto, has been to themselves, and they confounded in
their own devises. And yet for all this, so many tragical ends of their so
many traitorous proceedinges, are they not moved with any spark of
repentance. Neither has the ruin of so many of you their countrie-men
wrought and contrived by their practice, allurement and persuasion, bred in
them any feeling of remorse of conscience, but rather are thereby animated and
encouraged to set new devises abroch, with meaning in deed by sowing seditions
among you, and by opposing you against the state, to make you the only
instruments of the others ruin, and so to make the way open to the Spanish
tyrant, to which end there is no week but they receive spies and spials from
you. Insomuch that (I speak upon good assurance) there are at this instant
among you above three hundred seditious beggerlye priests, sent over by them to
no other purpose. A little before the coming of the Spanish fleet, they sent
four priests, and two Jesuits, in disguised apparel, thoroughly instructed to
sound the meaning of such Gentlemen, as they thought to be of their religion,
and to incline their minds to the Spanish cause, encouraging them to take Arms
against her MAJESTY, to which end they printed in English many hundred of
books in Antwerpe, barrelling them up until such time as the Army should have
been landed, and then their meaning was to have dispersed them, full of the
most blasphemous speeches and proud traitorous menaces, as well against her
Majesty, as against you all in general, as never (I think) the like was
heard of.

Besides, they have obtained of the Pope, and of the king, that as many as had
their voices in the parliament house, at such time as the Queen of Scotland
was adjudged to die, of what degree so ever they were, should be deprived not
only of their lives and livings, but that their posterity also should be for
ever dis-inherited and disanulled. The like also they threatened in their books
to all such, as well noble men as others, that should after the landing of the
Spaniards army, persist in arms against the same. But all this by the goodness
of God has but served to discover their wicked intentions, and to animate al
true Christian Englishmen, to persist with the greater love, unity and courage
in their obedience to her Majesty.

But returning again my speeches to you, (O unnatural Englishmen) to those
who^ you should obey treacherous and unfaithful, and of those that you do obey
contemned and made slaves! how can you endure to thirst after the destruction
of so sweet a country, in which you received your being, and that gave you
nuriture being young? What religion must that be, that animateth you to seek
subversion of so benign a princess and of so glorious an estate? The old
worthy Romans thought it the most heroycall thing that might be, to vow
themselves sometimes to death for their country, and even to spend their lives
in defense of their altars, temples and monumentes of their Elders: and you
seek to see your Country bathing in the blood of your parents, kindred, and
friends, to see your cities, temples, and ancient monuments flaming in the
fire, to see your virgins defloured, and further, to bring the noblest nations
to perpetual slavery and servitude, yea, and that of the most base, wicked,
proud and cruellest nation that lives, a nation not yet fully an hundred
years since wholly they received Christianity, and as yet are in their
hearts a great number of them, Pagans and Moors, from profession of which,
they are only held by the severe bridle of the sanguinary and most cruel
heathen Inquisition.

But that Paganism of theirs, which in their profession they dare not show,
they do in their tyranny, blasphemy, sodomy, cruelty, murder, adultery, and
other abominations sufficiently discover. If the Nunamantines Saquntines, and
Nessatiagis burned their towns, slew their wives and children, and families
themselves, rather than they would receive the yoke of worthy and virtuous
Nations that invaded them. What should we then do, whom our virtuous
ancestors have left honored with the innumerable trophies of many victories,
rather than to endure the insolent, wicked, and tyrannous government of that
Nation, whom all Europe has in horror, leaving to our posterity after us a
perpetual servitude and bondage, and an everlasting memory of cowardice.

But leaving this until a fitter time, I hope this that is already said
shall be sufficient to make you clearly and plainly understand, that there
is not to be obtained the sweetness, liberty, and tranquillity of conscience
which you expect and look for, but rather, turmoyle and grief of mind, with
a perpetual grudging and remorse of conscience, scandalized with infinite and
innumerable examples of evil life, impiety, sodomye, blasphemye, defamation,
and perjury. On the other side, toward her Majesty and the state of your
country, you shall be held and reputed as a traitor, and of those whom you
shall here serve, no better, who make no further reckning of any of us, than as
of base people, fugitives out of our cuntry for debt, theeuery, of some other
heinous crime or other, thinking it a matter impossible (howsoever we disguise
the same under pretext of religion) that any man being in his country of
honest calling or means to live, should be so senseless as to exchange the
same for a condition so base, beggarly, and infamous, as that which we do
here endure: And so did a Spanish Captain in plain terms signify to sir
William Standley, as they passed in the ordinary boot between Antwerp and
Brussels.

But now to the third point of my Discourse, concerning the mislike which
sundry of you have of her Majesty's government, and the state of your country
at this present, to seek to transporte your selves hither as into a haven of
bliss and security. I will by comparing the one with the other, as near as I
ca^, let you see the difference between the^ both, and so consequently, your
error, as near as I can guess, and by report of sundry coming thence
informed, this your disliking proceeds of two points: The one, that your
laws are too rigorously and severely executed against such as profess the
catholic religion: The other, that the adversary has buzzed a fear into
your heads, making you believe that the fortes of your state are too feeble to
resist so mighty and puisant an enemy as the Spanish king, whose mighty
treasures, many dominions, and armies of men they magnify to the skies, and
therefore perchance you covet to join betimes, with the party which you do
think most aduantagious for your future security and advancement.

First, touching the persecutions of Catholics, which our traitors here so
much exclaim upon, filling whole volumes therewith, and aggreuating the same
in terms most bitter and lamentable to foraine Nations. Let us see what
reason they have. I would feign demand one question, If ever they did read,
hear, or know of any one King or Queen, that did with greater mildness of
lenity tolerate or suffer within his or her dominion a sect of religion
opposite to the laws by him or her establyshed, especially the same having
sundry times rebelliously attempted against their crown, state, and dignity.

Let them look (if there be men of judgment) into the ages passed, even
amongst the Heathen, and into the present time among all the Princes of Europe,
and if there be not any to be found that has dealt with the like lenity as
her Majesty has done, why then do they so falsely slander her? Do they not
know that she is the sacred and anointed Queen appointed by God to govern
them? If they do, why do they not then with all penitencye and humility,
love, honor, and obey her, and praying to God to convert her (seeing such is
their desire) and not by traitorous mischief seek to murder and deprive her.
They learned not that of the ancient Christians in the primitive church. But
they will say, she has executed many seminary priests: I confess she has
indeed by cutting them off preserved her realm from many diseases that
rankled within the same. But yet has she proceeded therein in so gracious and
merciful a sort, that she has witnessed sufficiently unto the world, how
loath she is to come unto blood, so long as there is any other remedy in the
world to be used. For her Majesty knows, her council knows, you and I,
and the whole world knows, that the coming of these Seminaries, priests, and
Jesuits, to reconcile men, as they term it, to the obedience of the Roman
Church, is directly and obstinately to alienate and divert their minds from
her Majesty, and to incline them to be ready to assist any enemy either within
or without the realm, that shall color his cause under the pretext of
religion. Her Majesty, I say, and Council, and all good subjects knowing this,
and foreseeing the danger that might thereof ensue, forbade by Act of
Parliament these seminaries to enter into her realm, or to use or exercise
any such seditious doctrine, limiting therwithal a time to such as were within
the realm, to depart out of the same. But this sufficed not, these good
fellows think no laws good or to be obeyed, but such as they make themselves.

In they came as fast as before, great numbers of them were taken and
imprisoned, who though her Majesty deservedly and with great justice,
(especially the daily misciefe stirred up within the Realm by their seditious
practices considered) might have executed as traitors and rebels, yet the
greatness of her princely clemency and compassion was so loath to come unto
blood, that she caused them all once more to be pardoned, and to be put out
of the Realm, but with express commandment never to return in like sort:
in doing otherwise they should be sure to find no favor. All this would not
serve their turns, but in dispight of her Majesty and contempt of her laws,
sundry of them returned, of which some of them being taken, have received the
hire of their graceless disobedience and rebellous attempt.

But that her Majesty secketh not blood, as they most falsely gave out,
appears by her clemency used to sundry of them, taken by her soldiers in
the Low Countries, who though they were of sir William Standley his crewe and
adherents, her most professed enemies, yet seeing they were not taken within
England, she graciously pardoned them, and caused to be set at liberty, in
giving some little recompense to those soldiers that had taken them prisoners,
Where is then her rigor you speak of? I hope the king of Spain keeps
another manner of rule in his Countries, over all Spain, Portugal, Lombardie,
Naples, and Ciciliae, whosoever speaks a word, or makes the lest sigh in the
world to dislike his religion there established, or any one point or ceremony
thereof, his cruel ministers the Inquisitours, cause without remission to be
burnt alive: as for example, There was this last year a Citizen in Antwerpe,
one Gyles Rat a shoemaker, that going into Spain about some business, was
apprehended for smiling at the Image of our Lady, brought before the
Inquisitours, and by them presentlye condemned to fire, and with him an
Englishman for the like cause: whose name the Gentleman that saw them burned
knew not: but he told me that at the time of their execution, there mounted
on a scaffolde thereby two Jesuits, forbidding the people upon pain of
Excommunication to pray for them, saying that they had delivered them both
over in body and soul to the devil, as those that died obstinate and wilful
heretics. I would feign know how he would do with Ministers, if he should
catch them in Spain, as the Queen has done priests in England. As for his
Low Countries, I never heard but of two taken, and that was at the siege of
Dermond, and they were both put in to sackes by the Spaniards, and thrown into
the river.

This is indeed Tyranny, and not that which her Majesty does, who is always
ready to receive into grace and favor those of whom she has any hope that
they will become good subjects, and has (as I have heard) offered even at the
hour of their death her princely mercy and favor to some of them, if they
would have promised to become good subjects.

Oh how different from this is their proceeding here which you see so highly
commended! But it is the nature of men, especially of those, whose judgments
are not settled as they should be, always to mislike and loath those things
to which they are accustomed, thinking other to them unknown far better. If you
did but once see the tyranous usage and explication what is used in matter of
religion to the poor people under the Spanish government in this Country, I
doubt not but you would be of another opinion, especially the woeful slavery
considered in which the clergy, or rather the ravening multitude of Jesuits,
Friars, Monks and priests do keep their mind subjected. It is not sufficient
that they hold their minds in a perpetual despair, pronouncing upon every
frivolous point damnation unto them: but withal, they compel them perforce to
offerings, to buying of pardons and indulgences, to give them money toward
the reparation of their Churches, pictures, images, and wax candles, always
having one device or other in hand to rob them, and to draw from them their
substance: for whosoever yields not to every of these demands, is presently
an heretic.

The best houses in the Town they take violently from the true owners, and
appropriate unto themselves, saying it is meet that God should first be served
before man. There is no one day but the poor citizens are punished and
pestered with one or other of their orders of Friars, Monks, Mendicants,
Capuchines, Candles, and money toward the reparation of their Churches, and
which they must not be denied, unless you will be presently accused for an
heretic.

But the best is, to see how busy and diligent they are when they hear of a
wealthy man that lies sick, and is in danger of death. This is their chiefest
harvest and most optima praeda: then they commend unto him the poverty of
their cloister, and the merit that he should gain, as being for ever to be
remembered in their masses, as one of their benefactors: the Jesuits and
Cordelleres are at this present in process of Spain about this matter of
visitation of sick men, in articulo mortis. The Jesuits say that it
appertains unto them, because their profession is active, and always stirring
among the flock, and to do good in the world abroad, whereas that of the
Cordelleres is contemplative, and so by consequence, most decent that they
should contain themselves within their cloisters.

The Cordelleres on the other side replye, that their profession is meekness,
innocence, and poverty, and to do good unto all men. As for the Jesuits,
that they are proud, ambitious, aspiring, medlers in matters of state, men of
great riches, and covetous of more, and therefore by no means to be admitted
to such as lie at the article of death. The matter has been much argued of,
and greatly debated in Spain, and besides, the Jesuits have openly inueighed
against them in the public schools of Louaine: yet notwithstanding how ever
the cry goes against them, they hold their own. But this by the way, seeing
it comes so well to our purpose, I cannot choose but tell you a pretty jest which
happened this last Summer in these parts.

A Merchant of Antwerpe, whose name was Hamiel, being sick of a consumption or
fever ethike, the Jesuits knowing him to be a man of great possessions, and
without children, presentlye repaired unto him under color of spiritual
consolation, laying before him the vanity of this life and the certainty of
the world to come: with sundry other persuasions, as of all men living they
have their tongues most at will: withal, commending unto him their order, as
of all other the most meritorious, perfect, and acceptable to God, and to which
our holy father the Pope and his predecessors have granted more indulgences
than to any other order whatsoever: they brought the poor man, being of
himself simple, into their society, thinking that there was no other way to
be saved, and withal before hand infeoffed their college with his land, which
was two hundred pound a year, giving them besides, much goods and rich
moueables, and when he had so done, died within three months after the same:
his next heirs, by counsel of their friends, put the Jesuits in suite,
against which, though they opposed themselves with all vehemency, yet to their
great shame and reprehension, sentence was given against them. Notwithstanding
they would not give over, but by the means, aid, and support of president
Pameley, who is one of their best children, they appealed from thence to the
council of Brussels, getting the cause after sentence given to be removed, a
thing unusual or scarcely ever heard off before, as yet there the process
hangs, by hook or by crook it is thought they will have it in the end.
Another time a rich and wealthy Merchaunt of Antwerp, but one in that point
whose devotion and scrupulocity ouer-went his wisdom, coming to them in
confession, and telling them of some unjust gain with which he felt his
conscience touched, they suddenly with sundry terrifiyng speeches, told him
that he was in the state of damnation, out of which he could not be
delivered, until such time as he had made restitution as well of that
confessed, as of all other money and goods that he had by usury unlawfully
gotten, laying before him, Quod none dimittitur peccatum nisi restituatur
oblatum: with sundry other such sentences, of which they had store: in fine,
they put the poor man into such fear of conscience, that he yielded to make
restitution, if so the sane might be done without his undoing, dyscredite, or
shame. VVhereupon to comfort him again, but in deed fearing least that if
they dealt too rigorously with him they should get nothing, they told him,
that if in stead of all such interest and iniuryes, with which he felt his
conscience burdened, he would only be content to deliver unto them some such
sum of money, as without his undoing, he thought conveniently he might
spare, they would take it upon their souls to see the said sum employed
upon good, virtuous, and charitable uses, to the greater benefit and merit of
his soul, and as a thing more acceptable to God, and less scandelous to the
world than if he should make restitution to whom it appertained, and that were
by that his usury interessed. VVhereupon the Merchant being well satisfied in
conscience, gave them the money, and they him their absolution.

But I will hold you no longer with the recital of these things, of which if I
would entreat, their impiety would yield me too much matter. My principal
meaning and intention only being to let you see, that under heaven there is
no state so wickedly, impiously, and deuouringly governed in matter of religion
and conscience, as these here under the Spaniard. I think the recital of their
miseries would rather breed in you admiration than belief, so far does the
same exceed the compass of al their tyrannies that ever were used, there
being no calamity in the world of which they have not tasted of. Their noblemen
and rulers, in whose virtue and courage consisted their chiefest refuge in
times past, when they were wronged and tyrannixed, have been murdered,
strangled, poisoned, and slain by the bloody ministers of their cruel king:
they are taxed in great sums, and numbers of men sent violently into France
and foreign wars, and the relikes of their nobility forced to go with the^ in
person, to their apparent slaughter, leaving in the mean time their countries
in pray to the enemy, their villages flaming in fire, and their towns battered
about their ears with the canon, their privileges are by wrong and tyranny
taken from them, their cities that sometimes striued with oppulency and glory
with the goodliest and greatest of the world, are governed by base and
barbarous Spaniardes, brideled with their garrisons and castles, and forraged
and spoiled by them, at such time as their payment fails. No face of justice
in their commonwealth, but the same is pliable to the will of such strangers as
are governors of their towns, and captains of their castles, their goodly
havens, harboring sometimes with innumerable ships laden with merchandise from
all parts of the world, are now frequented even of the fisher-boates, their
traffic ceased, and their towns almost desarte: in the most of which, of
ten houses together, there are scarce three inhabited, their villages abroad
burned and ouergrowen with bushes, their goodly meddowes and fruitful pastures
drowned many miles wide and long, by letting in of sluices, and cutting down
ditches. The mansion houses and castles of their Nobility abused and thrown
down, the errable ground waste and untilled, insomuch that there a man may
have as much land as he will, and thanks withal, for the only manuring
thereof. As for the poor laboring people of the country, for the most part
they are all starued and consumed with hunger, of which disease, I my self
have known two thousand die in one summer, so that you may ride in some places
an hundred miles without seeing of a man, woman or child, unless it be some
poor silly soul that comes creeping out of the woods hunger starued, more
like confusitated ghostes, than a living christian creature. And yet all these
in a manner happier, because they are at an end of their miseries, than such as
do live within the inhabited places of the country, as Cempine and the land
of VVast: and these of all the people in the world I take to be the most
wretchedst. Over every village of these are appointed certain horsemen, to whom
they are all to pay monthly contribution, some ten pounds, some twenty, and
some thirty, some more and some less, I knew one village that paid an
hundred pounds every month, called Turnolt: but they paid it so long, till
all the dwellers ran away, and have now in a manner left it void of
inhabitauntes. Over this village and the whole Country is appointed a
Commissarie called Sygonio, for the payment of their contributions, of all
tyrants living the most cruellest, and of least conscience. Who if they fail,
and do not bring in their money at the last day of the month, he sendes
forth troops of horsemen to take the best of them prisoners, and withal, to
drive home to their quarters or garrisons such sheep, oxen, or cattle
whatsoever as they find in those villages, which he causes, if the money
follow not within five or six days at the furthest, to be sold at the drum
or Trumpet, and withal, forces them to pay a great fine, the one half of
which he retayneth to himself, and the other to the soldiers, for their
out-roads and forbearance of the money. But the misery of these poor people
ends not here, for besides all this, they are forced many times to lodge
soldiers in their houses, as they march along the country upon service, at
which time it is incredible what outrages they receive, their cattle killed,
their corn threshed out and given to horse, their chests broken up, their
goods eue^ to the very sheets and tikes of beds, stolen and carried away by
the soldiers when they march, themselves beaten, and their wives and their
daughters abused: and in fine, what else is to the nature of man grievous and
intolerable, they are constrained to endure. Neither is the condition of the
poor citizens or townsmen any better, who being forced to receive garrison,
and to lodge soldiers in their houses, imparting to them the best chambers and
commodities of the same, never hearing from them any other word, especially
if they please not them in all their exhorbitant demand,, than Perhamengo,
Lutherano, Borchio, etc. Yet, besides, they are daily wearied out with
continual exactions and taxations, as the hundred penny, the tenth penny,
and once a year without fail, the fifthly penny of all their goods and
lands, besides infinite other pillages and gatherings toward the making of
rampires, bulwarks, ballasadowes, countercerpes, and the reparation of their
walls, and to giving of munition, bread, beer, and cheese, to such soldiers as
shall pass by their towns distressed of victualles, with infinite such like. I
have known (I speak it of my faith) poor people of Antwerpe forced to sell
their beds they lie upon, to satisfy their tyrannous exactions, which if
they should not do, execution of their goods, attachment of their persons,
should presently follow. But which is most beyond reason, whereas within the
towns the most part of their houses are vacant and vnhired, yet the owners of
them are taxed according to the value in which they were wont to be hired.
Insomuch, that in Antwerpe and other towns, it is a matter very usual for men
to disclaim, and quit their own houses, thereby to be exempted of such
payment as otherwise by reason of the^ they are charged with, and that they do
iurisdicially before the magistrate, at which time the Ainan enters in, and
ceaizeth upon them to the kings use. Besides, when as sundry Gentlemen and
other the inhabitants of this country, having certain annual rents issuing
out and charged upon the kings demaines in the Duchy of Brabant, at least to
the yearly value of ten thousand pounds, some of the which rents have been by
themselves bought of the states general, some left unto them by their parents
and predecessors. The king unjustly and by tyranny disanulling the said
rents, has, and does, without form of justice, take into his own hands the
said demains, appropriating the use, commodity, and revenue thereof to the
maintenance of the troops of horse men. But what shall I trouble you any
longer with recounting unto you the assise, impositions, taxes, extortions,
pillages, and heavy intolerable burdens laid upon this afflicted poor
people, by their unjust and cruel king. Compare now (I pray you) heerewith,
your estate of government at home, and tell me which of them two you think to
be most fortunate. Does her MAJESTY deal in this order with you, whose
government you so much mislike? Oh God, how can you be so perverse, seeing the
blessedness wherein she maintains you, as not to acknowledge the same? How
gentle are the helps and subsidies which she exacteth of you, without the
undoing or hinderance of any man of whom they are exacted? And on the other
side, how profusely spends she her own treasure for the maintenance of your
wives, and children, and parents, in repose justice and security. Oh pray to
God for her long life and prosperous estate, for in her consists the tipe of
your felicity!

But now to the other point of your mislike. Whereas the adversary has
beaten into your heads, that the state stands dangerous, as being far too
feeble and not sufficient to withstand and resist so mighty and opposite an
enemy as is the king of Spain, terrifying with millions of gold and
innumerable nations over whom he commands, I hope by the clear and evident
reasons I shall show you, to make you understand that the fame of him is far
greater than his force, and that there is no prince this day in the world whose
estate stands more tickle and ready to ruin than his, and that there is no
cause why we should fear him, but many why he should fear us. First, that he
is the most mighty and oppulent prince of Europe, I do not deny, if he had
used moderation in his greatness, and acknowledged the benefits which God
has bestowed upon him with thankfulness. But such is the state whereunto his
ambitious aspiring has at this present brought him, or rather the reuengefull
hand of God which hangs over his head for his horrible, tyrannies and odious
offenses, especially for his wicked pariacide and murder committed upon the
person of his wife, his son, and sundry others of his best and truest
subjects: that he is in the midst of these his riches, indigent, poor, and
indebted, unable to give satisfaction to such soldiers as he maintains, to
which end he is forced to extort upon his poor subjects, and tyrannize over
them. Of this his indigency and beggary, we see every day experience here
before our eyes, his own natural subjects, the Spaniards, being the best
disciplined soldiers he has, and of whom he makes greatest account, are
forced for want of their paime^t, which is now three years behind, to cease his
towns and artillary, to contemn his commandments and proclamations, and
finally to bend their arms and display their Ensigns upon the walls against
the Duke. To remedy which mutiny, there was post upon post sent into Spain,
yet in seven months there could no money be found. Notwithstanding many and
most important detriments, he received by occasion of this mutiny, as the loss
of Breda, the retardaunce of the French succors, the danger of Numigen, etc.
whereas the whole sum they demanded was not much above fifteen thousand.
Besides, do but look into the manner of his proceedings in these low countries
with his soldiers, (of which because I have best experience I will chiefly
speak) and you shall find nothing in the world more beggarly and indigent.
Neither (as I hear) is it better in his other provinces, which verily I
believe, seeing of all others it imports him to use them best, as being his
eldest, perfectest in discipline, and best experienced troops, and in fine,
those unto whom he chiefliest reposeth, as the only vpholders and maintenance
of him in his tyranny. Yet was there never in the world, I dare undertake, King
nor Prince, how bankerout, or needy soever, in whose service so many brave
soldiers have died of hunger, or that have used such coosning tricks and
snifts to stop necessities, and to deceive his souldies as he has done.

First, the country not being yet fully consumed, wasted, and destroyed, he
authorized his soldiers to spoil and steal the goods and cattle of the
poor pesants, forcing them to ransom their houses from fire, and their
persons from murder, by which means the soldiers lingered in such sort, that
I have known them remain three years together with out one months pay. But
afterward Antwerpe, being rendered, and by reason of the general deuastation
of the country, the soldiers failing to find their wonted relief and pray,
grew into so great and miserable extremity, that it was a great matter to
find twenty soldiers under any Ensign. The Spaniards mutined upon the
Staunda, whom they found means to appease with some few months payment. The
VVallounds mutined in Laiskine, Houlke, and the land of the Wast, the Almaines
went by hundreds begging up and down the streets of Antwerp bare legged, and
bare footed, or in manner naked, the Italians starued in their quarters, and
diverse of them being in garrison in Breda, ran thence to Huisden, and to other
towns of the enemy. To remedy all which inconveniences, he found means to
deal with the Italian Bakers of Antwarp for cloth and silk, as Northern
kersies, packe-clothes, baies, refuse Italian silks, taking up the same upon
excessive interest yearly to a certain sum: for receipt of which, and
delivery out again, he appointed a Spaniard, one Christopher Craesa, a man of
most wicked conscience, to be his treasurer. Then he began to grant payments to
the whole camp, horse and foot, and unto such gentlemen and pensioners as
were in great extremity, and had bin long suitors: which they having received,
were forced for want of money presently to make sale thereof for the third of
that value in which they received it: so that a soldier having fourteen
shillings a months pay, received only four shillings and six pence. And he
has his factors and brokers abroad to buy those said clothes and silks again,
which he delivers presently out of the first price to the next that comes,
and so still forth delivering and buying the same again for the third part of
the price, insomuch that with an hundred pounds he makes ten thousand pounds
in a year, and yet sometimes he makes them stay four or five months before
he will deliver them cloth, or any contentment at all. And sometimes he never
troubles himself with the delivery of the cloth, but causes their
assignatio^ to be boght, as now at this instant sir William Standly before his
departure had obtained a Liberanca for two months for his regiment, amounting
to an hundred and fifty pounds, the payment thereof, has been deferred till
this present, and is now sold in Antwerpe to one of his factors for three
score pounds, and yet he that sold it made a good bargain. I have known
diverse that have sold diverse such Liberancas for thirty pounds, and eight and
twenty pounds in the hundred. Yet this payment how bad soever, has somewhat
contented the soldiers four or five years, rather having that than nothing.
But now also the same is dried up and come to nothing. Payments have been this
half year very scarce, and with much difficulty, for the merchants have at
this instant utterly refused to furnish him with any more wates, both because
the same wherein he stands already indebted unto them amounts to an
excessive matter, as also he begins to wrangle with them, about the
interest of which he craves moderation: seeing besides before their eyes so
many presidents of men ruined, undone, and dishonored, such as he has dealt
withal, of which, what more apparaunt example may there be than that of S.
Siueres a Portugal merchant and one of the chiefest and best respected marcha^t
of Antwerpe, both for the wealth and credit which he possessed, as also for the
security and uprightness which he handled: the Duke of Parma reducted of
Antwerpe, the passage of the river shut up, and the countries and towns
afflicted with great dearth and scarcity of corn, at which time rye was at 44.
s. sterling the virendel in Antwerpe, and withal being daily cried upon by the
general of Vibres for munition and corn to victual the camp, the old store
being clean consumed: knew no other means than to deal earnestly with this
S. Siueres, and other merchants that had trade with Hanborough, Lubeck, and the
Easterlings, which countries were replenished with corn, to make some adventure
thither for the relief of the country: he amongst the rest showed not
himself unwilling to enter into an action so charitable and virtuous, if so be
his pains might be requited, and he sufficiently warranted and kept free from
such danger as might ensue, either by peril of sea, taking of the enemies, or
loss in the same: when it came to this end, the duke sent into Spain, and
procured him the kings Letters of assurance in the most ample manner possible,
encouraging him with much thanks and many promises to proceed, which he did
with the adventure of most part of his credit and goods, insomuch, that he
laded three ships of which one was scattered by tempest, and cast away upon
the coast of Scotland, the other two came safely home to Callice, but at that
time such was either the il luck of him, or the good luck of the country,
that upon a new plenty harvest which they had, corn was abated from forty
four shillinges the Virendell, to six shillinges, at which price the Duke, by
the kings appointment, bought his provision and munition, utterly refusing
that of Syueres, so that he was feign, whilst he made his suit to the king, to
keep the same so long upon his own hands, that it venowed and waxed mustie,
in some sort, that he was feign to throw the greatest part away, without ever
to this day being able to receive of the king one penny of recompense,
insomuch that he was forced, to the wonderful grief, shame and confusion of
him, his wife, his children, and friends, having before time lived in the
greatest honor and magnificence of any Merchant in the Town, to break
banquerout, and is at this present suing to the Duke, and the privy Council
at Brussels, for a protection to keep his body from attachment.

These are the rewards and recompense that this mighty Monarch gives to
those that employ their endeavors in his service. Of which if you do desire to
have better experience, look but into the office of his treasurer at Brussels,
and there you shall daily and hourly see a token sufficient of his oppulencie
and great magnificencie, there shall you find a miserable troop of sutours,
with assignations for money, granted them by the Duke, some of which have lost
a leg or an arm, either thorough age or infirmity, that has gotten their
Lisence and Pasport to depart into their Countries, some pretending one cause
and some another, but no one man able in two years following to get one penny:
so that there is no year but a great number of them die in the pursuit for
hunger, yea, and some of them even at his gates. Of my salvation I speak it, I
have known some poor people, that for the sum of six pounds have followed
him three years: when either he goes out, or comes into his house, he is
feign to go thorough gardens and by-ways, to deceive his poor suitors, who
otherwise assayed him, though in vain, with such ruthful cries, that it would
pearse any man's heart to hear them. Which beggerlinesse, and misery,
sundry worthy soldiers of strange nations seeing, especially the base and
unworthy usage which they themselves received, have abandoned that banquerout
service, as John Baptista de Monte, and Camillo de Monte, two warlike
Captains, but now retained under two mighty states, the one General to the
Duke of Florence, the other to the Venetians, who both lie in wait to cry
quittance with him, and by Gods grace shall one day have means to accomplish
their desire. Then sir Martine Skinke, of whose just coffeehouse and
valerous revenge, you your selves in England are witness. Where are then the
mou^tains of treasure that the mighty king possesses? Or if ye say he
spares them to some other end, I pray you tell me to what, and when he will
use them? If not now the danger of the loss of his country, fame, and
religion, and the greatness of the causes he has undertaken and considered.
No, no, it is pure want and extreme indigences that forces him to deal so,
though he be rich, yet the greatness of the cause he is entered into, does
farte exceed the means he has to maintain the same. Upon the coming
down of this last fleet he set up his rest, and lost it, not only his own,
but that also of his friends, the pope, the duke of Sauoy, the Geneoises, etc.
which set him into such arrerages, that I think he will not easily come out
of them.

As for the treasure of his Indians, where in deed consists the very
marrowe, strength, and substance of all his puissance, I confess the same to
be great, yet his charges considered, making an estimate between the one and
the other, it can no way be able to answer and counteruayle them. And yet
the same has been reasonable well impaired also, since such time as sir
Fraunces Drake and other of your worthy English captains by sea, have begun
to firke him in those. For whereas before he was wont usually to wait his
Indian fleet home-warde with a Gallyasse or two, only their return
accustomed to be every six months, he is now forced to maintain a great
and mighty Navy of many ships and gallyes, to his inestimable and continual
charges. Notwithstanding all which, his return is seldom above once a year,
and that oftentimes minglingly as may be, and yet they are sometimes met
withal, some of them scattered, some sunk, and some of them also taken by our
English ships.

If you will know what these his great charges are, on which he is enforced
to employ them. First, consider that he scarcely holds any country in which
he is not constrained to hold garrisons of soldiers. As for these low
Countries, I know it upon good and assured grounds, there has been no year
these twenty years, but they have cost him one with another two millions and
more yearly above the revenue and other commodities received thereout, and yet
how beggarly his soldiers are used, you have heard before.

The rest, for Naples, Cicilia, Portugal maiorque, minorque, the frontires of
Arragon and Navarre, and Lombardie: he is feign to be at the charge of many
strong and mighty garrisons by land, and in the most of them maine Gallyes or
other shipping in the Havens, and all along the Seacoasts, none of which he can
for his life diminish, for his government is so hateful, that none of these
provinces are his any longer than he has their heads in the bridle. And
besides, his provinces stand so severed and disunited, that the transporting of
his navy from one to an other is infinite chargeable unto him, insomuch that I
have heard some of his commissioners here swear, that there is no crown of
his that comes from Spain into these Countries by land, but stands them in
five rialles, so infinite is the charge of carriages, conuoyes and
commissaries, to deliver and receive the same.

Besides all this, he disburseth yearly mighty sums of money to the Persian,
to the end to keep the Turk occupied, of whom he stands mightily in fear:
and truly he has reason, if her Majesty would condescend to such conditions
as have been by this Turk to her proposed. But she like a christian
Princess, how greatly soever to her advantage the same might be, will not do
any thing whereby christianity might hereafter seerne to receive any detriment.

As for Polonia, the same has been incredible chargeable unto him, as well for
the mighty bribes bestowed upon the nobles of the country, as also the charges
of a great army of Rewtiers: he sent his kinsman Maximilian of Austria, what by
force and what by help of the part which he had gained, and with his treasures,
thought to inuest him in the kingdom. The success of which enterprise I would
not write, being to the whole world notorious and known. In the consistory of
Rome he is feign to entertain a great number of those hungry Cardinals in
pension and fee, thereby to gain their voices when need requires, which
liberality of his he cannot by any means withdraw, for in so doing, he
should be assured to have them his enemies, and contrary to his proceedings.

Lastly, for conclusion, he makes at this instant open wars with France,
England, and the Low counties. What deem you then hereof? Has he not (trow
you) vent for his treasures? His father was a better soldier and a greater man
of war than he is, and as mighty a prince every deal (his Portugal Indians
only excepted) in place of which he quietly inioyed these his Low countries,
which in respect of their great oppulencie, abundance of riches, and
conuenientnes of situation, were to them accounted nothing inferior. And yet
he never dared attempt to make wars upon France alone, but he first sought by
all possible means to assure himself in friendship with England, giving to
that end great and mighty presents to Cardinal Wolsey, and others of the
council, that in those days were with her Majesty's father of worthy
memory, K. Henry the eight: whereas his son makes war with all the world
carelessly at once, but the Italians have a true proverb, Cum tutto abraccianes
iunque string. And so I hope it shall fare with him.

Now as touching those his mighty and puisant numbers of men which they say he
is able to make, I take upon me to know the state of his forces as well as
other, and I herein of all other men know him to be most needy and wanting.
For as for Spain, Naples, and Lombardie, of which his only force consists,
and which are his chiefest storehouses of men, it is sufficiently known that
his drums have gone a whole year beating up and down, according as their
manner is, to get together six thousand men, and those all shepheardes,
hedgebreakers, and such idle trewantly rogues, the most part of which he is
forced to put in garrison for a year or two to fashion them, before he send
them to service. I saw about two years agone a fresh levy that came out of
Pastrauia, who put them presently in the castle of Antwarpe, drawing out the
old garrison, the most silly naked snakes that ever I saw in my life, such,
as in my conscience, a man in deed would beat ten of them.

As for Germany, out of the which heretofore he has drawn great numbers,
and by their help done great matters before Mastrig in Freisland, and those
places, his usage has been so base and miserable unto them, that the old
soldiers are all starued and consumed in his service, whose calamity has so
terrfied the rest at home, that no prince in Europe has less credit to raise
men there than he. And although there were no such matter, yet they are no
way more bound unto him than to an other, their profession being to serve
only him best that will pay them best, and yet if he should raise any of
the allyaunces of her Majesty, and the situation of their Country
considered, it should be a matter of great difficulty to join them with his
other troops. Where are then his innumerable legions, with which he means to
overcome the world? Alliance he has none, unless it be with the rebellious
league of France: of them he can receive no aid nor comfort, themselves being
miserable and distressed, by reason whereof, most burdenous unto him, and yet
there is no man living in the world less beholding unto them than he. For
notwithstanding all his assistance, they would never yield to receive his
forces into their towns or fortresses, serving only their turns on him for
the present time.

As for the Pope and the Princes of Italy, what fair weather so ever they do
bear him, he neither trusts them, nor they him, and great reason they have
so to do. And wythall, this malediction hangs upon him, that as he is of
all foreign Nations distrusted, doubted, and abhorred, so both he and the
very name of a Spaniard is most loathsome and hateful to the rest of his own
subjects. Insomuch, that in Millaine the young Gentlemen have a pastime by
night, which they call Caccia Marran, that is, putting on a visard on their
face by night, they go with their long Rapiers or picked Bastinadoes under
their cloakes, out into the Town to seek Spaniardes in the stews, or any
other place where they think they are lykely to find any of them: unto whom
they give as many stabbes and blows that they can lay upon them, insomuch
that the Spaniards dare not for their ears abide out of the castle after
shutting in of the gates. As for his dealing in Portugal, who knows not his
cruel tyranny, and the hatred they bear him?

But now come to her MAJESTY, and you shall find another manner of state of
matters, her realm plentifully abounding in men of warlike disposition, of
whom she is loved and adored: her wars are just, charitable, godly, and
defensive, for maintenance of which, besides the trust that she reposeth in
God, who has hitherto mightily and miraculously defended her, she is alied in
straight league, friendship and confederation with the most victorious and
christian king of France, with the kings of Denmark and Scotland, with the
Switzers, and with sundry princes and states of the Empire, al being her
neighbors dominions united with hers, and thereby ready to assist, aid, and
succor one another in all such occasions as shall or may happen. All this then
considered, tell me, I pray you what occasion of fear or misdoubt you have.
If you think the English valor not to be compared with that of the Spaniard,
read but the Chronicles, and you shall find how much you are deceived: you
shall find that a small army of Englishmen, under the conduct of that
worthy prince of Wales, eldest son to Edward the third, passed in despite
of them thorough Cauarre into Spain, and there in the midst and bowels of
their own country, overthrew at Nadres their usurping king, Henry the bastard
(of whose race this man is descended by his grandmother) being accompanied with
the nobility of the country, and 60000. of the brauest fighting men in
Spain, and so utterly overthrew him, that they erected king in his place Don
Pedro, their just and lawful prince of that kingdom, whom by maine force they
constrained all their cities and noble men of the country to receive. Read
besides the valorous conquests achieved by John Duke of Lancaster, brother
unto the said prince, in Callicia, against Don John, son of the said Henry,
the usurping bastard: besides, the chronicles of Portugal are full of the
material prowess of the English, and glorious victories obtained in service
of their king, to whose aid they were called against the said king of Castilo.

But what need I run back into the passed ages to seek examples? Look but
into the incounters that have been of late days between them and us, either
by sea or land, and you shall find that they have always carried the blows.
As by land, at the encountering of Grane, and that of Sutphen, where the honor
of the world and ornament of England, sir P. Sidney by his aduenturous valor
was slain, besides many other bickerings and skirmishes of less moment
needles to recite. Of sea matters, I account it bootlesse to speak, so greatly
and above measure glorious is the same, and bruited through the world: of the
worthy voiages of sir F. Drake, sir I. Haukins, sir M. Frobisher, C. Raiman,
and the rest of the brave and courageous Gentlemen, who for the benefit of
their country, have not spared to make adventure of their lives and fortunes.

But if you desire one example of all, let that then serve of his huge late
fleet, with which, Golyas like, he threatened heaven and earth, and with which
he thought to have circumuented and surprised at unawares her Majesty, whilst
falsely, wickedly, and abusiuely, he entertained her Graces Commissioners in
Flanders with a treaty of peace. To which her Highness like a Christian
princess, and for to avoid the effussion of Christian blood, was very
vnclinable. But God, as he has always done, so at this time did he
miraculously protect her Majesty in such sort, that through the great, careful,
and exceeding valorous resolution of that most worthy and renowned Gentleman
the Lord Admiral of England, of whose courageous behavior and terror, with
which he amazed them, the very enemy himself, though against his will, makes
worthy mention. They were with a small number of English so fiercely and
vigorously encountered, that their resistance not prevailing them, they were
scattered, chased, and utterly discomfited, in such sort as the whole world
knows, so that Lucans verse, me thinks, may very fitly be applied unto
them, Territa quaesitis ostendunt terga Britannis.

Besides, what better trial can you have of the valor of their nation than
this, being thirty thousand, the cream of all their forces, and about the
assembling of which he had been three years busied, yet when they came upon the
coast of England, dared not to land a man: whereas we the next year
following with a little Navy, containing not above eleven thousand men, under
the conduct of the two most renowned Captains, sir John Norris and sir Frances
Drake, landed in Spain, burnt his shipping, put his people to the sword, and
his towns to the fire, and coasted thence along into Portugal, and there
landing, marched in his country, even to his gates of Leisbone, with drums
sounding, and ensigns displayed: from whence we returned unfought withal by
any of his forces either by sea or land.

These things well considered, me thinks you have greater reason to hope one
day to see English Ensigns displayed in Madrill, together with the utter
ruin of that proud tyrant of Spain and his holy father the pope, with all
their rabble, than any way to fear him or his proceedings. And yet there is
one point besides all the above rehearsed, out of which we may receive
singular comfort, as that which of all other most deeply vexes and afflicts
his cogitations, and which, no doubt, before it be long, will give us a great
advantage against him, and that is, the contention which he sees to spring up
in his own house, of which I will briefly discourse unto you the occasions,
because you shall understand the same the beeter.

He has by several wives three children living, two Daughters and one son,
the Son young of years, sickly of body, pale and weak of complexion, of
wit poor and unfurnished, in a manner a very idiot.

His eldest daughter, whom they call La Infant of Spain, a woman as by birth
great, so proud exceedingly, haughty minded, and above measure aspiring,
prudent, in her speeches maiesticall, in her countenance and actions
courageous: her he has always norished under his own wing, acquainting her
even from her cradle, with matters of state and government. In which now by
reason of her long train and experience therein, she is exceedingly practiced
and ripe. With her what weighty matter so ever he undertakes, he
participateth the same before, demanding her advice and counsel, spending
sometimes whole half days they two in communication together. Upon her (the
youths weakness and simplicity of the young prince considered) are the eyes of
all men thrown, upon her depend the nobility, gentility, and commons, and
innumerable troops of suitors, into whose hearts she has so insinuated her
self, that they do bear an exceeding love and reverence toward her, many
mighty men have bin offered her in marriage, as the Emperor Rodolph, the king
of Scotland, and diverse other, but she until she see what will become of her
father, whom she sees old, oppressed with infinite cares, and not likely long
to live, upon whose death, her actions and manner of life does assuredly show,
that she is not of metal sufficient to give place to the young idiother
brother, but at least she means to part stakes with him.

In Spain she knows there is no law Salike, to bridle her ambitious
thoughts, but women may succeed as men, for so grandmother Iouina did
Ferdinando her father. Having these examples before her eyes, she feeds her
mind with high and ambitious desires, of which she has made so clear and
evident demonstrations, that her father to prevent this mischief that he
fears, was forced this last year to assemble the whole estates of Spain,
and to make them swear to be true unto his son, whom he presently caused to
keep his court a part, sending him sundry of his council, and commanding the
nobility to be attendant on him, acquainting him, as much as in them lies,
with managing of matters of weight, estate, and government. Besides, it is
here bruited for certain amongst us, that the president of Artois Richardol,
who^ the Duke of Parma had sent into Spain, to make his excuses and
iustifications against certain points of treason, of which he was by the Duke
of Pastrauia and prince of Ascoly accused to the king, is now returned with
commission to assemble the nobles and states of these Countries, and to cause
them to take the like oath to his son, thereby to prevent as well his
daughter as the Duke of Parma of their conceived hopes.

But now to come to his second daughter, whom he has long sithence bestowed in
marriage upon the Duke of Sauoy, with absolute promise and solemn vow between
him and her, to leave her a kingdom for her dowry. She is a princess in
ambition and high desire nothing ynequall to her sister, but in wit and courage
far her inferior, she and her husband both already take upon them in their
manner, style, and usage, a state and title far beyond their dignity,
convenient only unto kings. Altessa is the meanest phrase they will be spoken
in unto, refusing any letters that are not so entitled, for such is the will
and pleasure of the king her father. Naples and the Duchy of Millaine they
have already devoured in their hopes, which if her father at his death leave
not quietly unto them, they will be so bold as strain courtesy with his son, to
get them perforce if he can. On the other side, the states of Italy like not
such a mighty neighbor amongst them, and therefore to prevent both him and his
father in laws desseignment, have made a most straight secret league and
alliance among themselves, tearming the same Ragoyne de Stato: in which are
comprised the pope, the Venetians, the Duke of Florence, the Duke of Parma, the
Dukes of Vrbine, Mantua, and Ferrara: the duke of Parma dared not to enter in
among them, but is forced, though none more agreed, to dissemble and temporize
than he for a while, he knows that the king has been exceeding ielous, and
seeks, though slily and dissemblingly, his life, honor, and reputation. But
above al, the dissension of Portugal, to which he persuades himself to have
right, as in truth his title is better than that of the king of Spaines,
sticks deep in his stomach, Manet alta monte repostum, and we doubt not
but one day, when occasion shall serve, he will make the world witness of
his coffeehouse, which the king well knows and greatly fears, but he
must have patience, for he can hardly remedy it, unless the duke will
wittingly overthrow himself, especially having these means in his hands
which he has, not only to work his own security, but to cry quittance
also when time shall serve.

But having now exceeded the limits of a Letter, it is time I refrain my pen,
hoping that these alleged demonstrations shall, if not to work the good
effect which I desire in you and other Gentlemen of my Country, yet at the
least to manifest the dutiful zeal and love I bear to the state of my
Country, as to all faithful members thereof, in participating unto them such
things as by painful and dangerous experience I have gathered, and do think
necessary to be known, wherein I have used such truth, that I hope no man
living shall be able to disprove me, though I doubt not but the same shall be
by some maliciously censured, and my self subject to abide the brunt of their
malice, being assured that I shall not avoid the poisoned rancor of their
infamous defaming tongues and pens. For seeing they spare not in their
traitorous speeches and infamous pamphlets, princes, noblemen, and counselors,
men of great authority and virtue, it were folly for me to look to escape
scot-free. But such is the joy I conceive in my good meaning, that I shall
receive comfort thereof, as a thing greatly redounding to my credit, of such
men as they are to be ill spoken of.

Now lastly for conclusion, whereas you write that if there were no other
benefit to be gotten in these parts, but attaining the languages of foreine
nations, with the knowledge of military discipline and assayres of matter of
state, wherein you hear my self and others your countrymen have in these
parts greatly profited themselves, it were a motion sufficient not only to
make you leave your country for a time, but to hazard your self to any
dangers in forain parts, I have thought good therein to let you understand,
that albeit I must confess, that I have in those things profited more
perchance, (without ostentatio^ be it spoken) than others of our nation, for
the most part have done: yet as the time now serves, and the case now stands
at this present, there is no possibility that you or any other may in far
longer time than I have spent, attain to the like: and if you could, yet the
dangers that in aduenturing the same you should endure, were far greater
than the benefits you could possibly reap, might in any wise counteruaile,
were they such as might answer your expectation. In which respect, I pray you
first consider, that when I came first over hither, the wars then here
undertaken seemed and were in appearance to all the manner sort of men in the
world. But intestine wars between the prince and his subjects, such as no
other foraine prince, and most especially our most noble Queen and Sovereign,
was then nothing interessed: whereas since it has bin made manifest to the
world, that these wars and injuries offered by the king of Spain to those of
the Low countries, whose laws, customs and privileges, he has most violently,
tyranously, wrongfully, and periuredly broken, whereby he has freed them from
his subjection, yoke, and tyranie, and justly and deservedly for ever lost al
such preheminences, prerogatives, authority, and jurisdiction as he pretended
over them, as more amply appears in the ancient records of the privileges of
these nations, which both he and his predecessors at their entry of government
into these provinces have solemnly vowed and sworn to maintain all in
general, and every in particular inuiolate, and upon that covenant and
condition they have reciprocally sworn to him due fidelity and obeisance, he
failing in the one, they to be exempted from the other. Noreouer, her Majesty
seeing the lamentable and most pitiful cause of her distressed neighbors and
allies, finding no other possible means by laborers, suits, messages, and
sundry Ambassadors which she most honorably sent to the king of Spain for
pacifieng the said troubles, and reconciling the said king and those: sometimes
his said subjects have been enforced to take pity and commiseration of their
most miserable and afflicted estate and distress, and for their relief, to
her excessive and almost importable charges, to undertake a most just, godly,
and charitable defensive war against those that daily seek the blood, lives,
goods, lands and liberties of the inhabitants of the said distressed nations.
Since which being published, I think it not only unlawful, but also a most
heinous and capital crime and offense for any her Majesty's subjects to serve
on the contrary part.

Besides, it shall be good for you and all other good subjects of her Majesty's,
to remember that consideration being had by her Majesty and her most honorable
prudent council, of the loosenes of many of her subjects, and small respect
they had to her Highness and country, and as little to their own safety, his
Majesty has caused to be published and set forth diverse laws, ordinances,
proclamations, and inhibitions, whereby all her subjects, (except known
merchants and strangers) are straightly forbidden to pass the seas into any
foreign parts without especial lisence of her Majesty at this time.
Therefore if you or any other her Graces subjects, shall now attempt to
pass the seas without lawful lisence, there is no reason why you should expect
any other than the rigor of the laws and justice, and to be holden guilty of
cases capital, especially such as shall serve under so open and professed an
enemy to the crown and state.

Further, I pray you to have in consideration, that when I came over hither,
the case so stood, as all Gentlemen of any quality or merit, were gratefully
received, and employed in good and honorable services: whereas since the
Spaniard has professed himself open enemy to her Majesty and the state of
her Realm, he has had all Englishmen in very base account, being ielous
and extremely suspicious of those that be most inward with him, and who for
his sake have made shipwreck not only of their honor and credit, but also of
their loialtie, duty, and allegiance to her Majesty and their native
country. Examples whereof are infinite, and partly touched in my Discourse
before set down.

Besides, there is of late crept into that nation a viperous brood of Jesuits
and priests, most dangerous and malicious enemies to her Majesty, and to their
own country vile and pernicious, instruments of the pope and his adherents,
who daily (as it is manifest to them that have knowledge and experience of them
and their actions) seek nothing more than the utter ruin, pulling down, and
destruction of her Majesty and their country, which bred and nourished them,
and al true professors of the Gospel and christian religion thoroughout
christendom, he therefore that thinks to live amongst these pernicious
people in any credit or account, let him, as he worthily does deserve, be
accounted besides his wits, or else disobedient and traitorous to God, her
Majesty, and his country.

As for my part, seeing the impiety of this place and the wicked and
detestable end whereto their drifts and practices are directed, I have long
since retired my self, living aloof from them, abandoning and utterly
rejecting the merit of my long service, and all such hopes and prefermentes,
which I might as well as any man else of my quality of my nation have
pretended and should have as soon obtained. And have ever since by all
possible means, as well by my self as by my friends, labored with her
Majesty's most honorable privy council about my return, which by the
special grace and benignity of my Sovereign, I am in comfort shortly to
obtain, desiring to spend my poor talent, and the residue of my life in the
service of her Majesty, my most honorable princess and sovereign Lady, whom
God of his everlasting goodness bless with many years, and endless prosperity,
to the joy of her subjects, and all faithful christians dispersed throughout
the whole world.

Finis.
