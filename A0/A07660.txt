An Observation.
The division of the verses is known by this mark

THE MINDS Melody.
PSALM. I.
BLESSED is the man,
Yea happy than,
By grace that can
Eschew ill counsel and the godles gates:
And walks not in
The way of sin,
Nor does begin
To sit with mockers in the scornful sates.
But in IEHO VAES law
Delites aright,
And studies it to know
Both day and night:
That man shall be
Like to the tree
Fast planted by the running river grows:
That fruit does bear
In time of year,
Whose leaf shall never fade, nor rute vnlouse.
His actions all,
Ay prosper shall,
Which shall not fall;
The godles men but as the calfe or sand:
That day by day,
Wind driuith away,
Therefore, I say,
The wicked in the judgment shall not stand:
Nor sinners rise no more
Whom God disdaines,
In the assembly where
The just remains:
For why? the Lord,
Who bear'th record,
Does know the righteous conuersations ay;
And godles gates,
Which he so hates,
Shall quite die, perish and doubtless decay.
PSALM IIII.
TO thee I call,
In my great thrall,
And troubles all:
Hear me, o Lord my God of righteousness,
Of mercy free,
Thou have set me
At liberty,
Have mercy Lord, and rid me from distress.
O men of mortal name,
How long will ye
My glory turn to shame,
With vanity?
O Sons of men,
Why do ye then
Seek after lies with the ungodly ghuest:
The Lord above,
Does surely love
The godly man, and hears my request.
In aw therefore,
Give God the glore;
And sin no more:
With quiet mind examine well your heart.
Your sweet incense
Of innocence
With confidence
Bring to the Lord, your selves to him convert.
The worldly wretch all day
Does never cease,
For well and wealth to pray,
This life to ease:
But thou thy grace,
And loving face
With brightfull beams make on us Lord to shine
Grant us thy light
And favor bright,
We pray the Lord thine ear to us incline.
With heart and voice,
I will rejoice,
And make my choice
Of this thy grace, before all worldly care:
This treasure great
Does me delight,
With joy perfect,
More then the wretch, for all his goods and geas
As granes and grapes so gay
In time of year,
That filles his heart, I say,
With joyful cheer.
In rest and peace,
I find release,
And willy down, and sleep with sound repose;
For thou my guarde,
And sure reward,
My help, my hope, do keep me from my foes.
PSALM VI.
LORD Irequyre,
That in thme ire
Fuming as fire,
Thou me no ways rebuke nor yet reject:
Though I do swerue,
And so deserve,
That I should sterue,
In mercy Lord, I pray thee yet correct:
For grief and anguish he:
Me so oppressed,
That in my weary bones
I find no rest:
My soul and mind,
Are so sore pynde,
That it I can express in no degree:
O Lord I say,
How long delay,
Will thou to cure my woe and misery?
Let thy sweet face,
And wonted grace
In time and space
Return to free my soul from all her pain:
Not for no thing
That she can bring;
That is condign,
But for thy mercy freely made her gain.
For why? amongst the dead
Who shall thee praise?
Shall dust and ass in earth
Thy glory blaise?
My plaintes trewlie,
So grievous be,
That I am like to swerue I am so faint,
All night I greet,
My couch I weet
With trickling tears gusht out with my complaint.
Mine eyes dim be,
And will not see
My sin trewlie,
And grief hes so possessed my heavy heart;
For fear of those,
That bomy foes,
And would rejoise
To see my wreak and would my soul subvert.
But now away all ye
That wicked be:
For the Lord he has heard
My plaint and cry:
And not only,
He has heard me,
But granted my request and whole desire:
And shall my foes,
In time disclose,
And the^ confound with shame in his hot ire
PSALM VIII.
IEHOVA, Lord
Who can record
In writ or word
Thy name so great on earth and every where?
Which thou have plaist,
As pleased thee best,
And worthiest
Above the heavens and crystal cleared air.
Thou makes thy laud and praise
Thy strength and might
From breath of babes to rise,
Both day and nigh:
In suckling ones,
Thy graces remains
For to be seen, and beauty excellent:
The mouth to close
Of godless foes.
That ready are to slay the innocent.
When I behold
The high heavens mould,
That does unfold
Thy wondrous works by thy own fingers wroght
The Moon so bright,
And starrie light,
That shines by night:
With gleaming fires, all formed out of noght:
What thing is mortal wight,
Then do, I say,
Of whom thou Lord of might,
Art myndfull ay?
The Son of man,
What is he than,
Whom thou by grace do choose and beautify
Yet little less,
I must confess,
Thou have him made then Angels in degree.
And thou his name,
And glorious frame,
Exalts with same,
And crowns his head with royal Majesty:
And as a King,
Him sets to reign,
Over every thing,
That life, breath, form and shape has taine of thee
As sheep, Ox, horse, and beast
That feeds on land:
Yea all such things are preast
At his command:
The fish that swym,
With out-spred fin,
And fowls eachone that haunt into the Air:
IEHOVA Lord,
Who can record
Thy Name so great on earth and every where?
PSALM XV.
OLORD who shall
Thy tent indwell,
Celestial,
Who shall abide within thine holy hill?
That walks in light,
And does that's right
With all his might.
His brothers name does not reproach and spill:
Nor yet can hear his fame
In any sort
To be imparde with blame,
Or false report:
That does abstain
From every mean
And wrongful way to work his neighbor woe
And in whose sight
The wicked wight
That God despytes, despyted is also.
But such as love
The Lord above,
He does approve
And honors them with love and reverence:
That band does make,
And will not break,
For loss nor lack
That may ensue, nor any such pretense.
Nor yet does put his coin
To usury:
Nor the just cause purloyne
Through bry berie,
Who means right so,
These things to do,
And steadfastlie does keep the persite way,
As Syon Hill
He shall stand still.
And never move, nor perithe or decay.
PSALM XIX.
THE firmament,
And heavens out-stent,
So excellent
Thy handiwork and glorious praise proclaim
Each day to day,
Succeeding ay
In their array,
And night to night by course do preach the same:
No sound of breath nor speech
Of men have they,
Yet euerie-where they preach
Thy praise, I say:
Their line goes out,
The earth about,
Their voice is heard throughout the world so wide:
There he a throne,
Set for the Sun
And Paylion plight, his mansion to abide.
Who like a groom
Of great renoume
Right brave does come
From chamber straight with comlie countena^ces
Or like a knight
In pleasant plight,
Does haste with might
To run the race, his honor to aduances
His rising and his race
It does appear
Even from the out-most space
Of heavens Sphere,
Then hes he taine,
His course again
Through azurde sky by revolution right:
Nothing can be
Hid from the eye
And burning beams of that great lamp of light
Gods word is clear
His law sinceere,
And most enteere
The sinful soul to him for to convert:
His precepts pure,
Both firm and sure,
And can allure,
And make right wise the sober simple heart.
Thy ways and statutes all
Are righteousness,
Which glad the souls in thrall,
With joyfulnesse,
They give clear light,
To our blind sight,
Thy fear is pure and ever permanent:
Thou cannot rue;
Thy judgments true,
And righteous are, o Lord Omnipotent.
Much gold of price,
Refyned twyce,
Yea, more then thryce
Is not in worth with them for to be valu'de:
The honey white,
Pure and perfect,
Moving delight
Is not so sweet, nor so much to be craved.
They make thy servants wile
And circumspect,
And what to enterprise,
They him direct
In keeping them
Great is the gain
And rich reward for such lade up for ever:
But who can count
Sins that surmount
From secreet sins, good Lord my soul deliver.
O Lord vouchsaue,
I humbly crave
Me for to save,
And cleanse my heart from proud presumptuous sin:
Then shall I be.
From sins set free
That troubles me,
Preserve me Lord that I walk not therein:
And let them not prevail
Me to possess:
Then I will without fail
Love righteousness:
Accept my plaint,
Which I present
Before thy sight with humble heart and voice:
My strength and stay,
Thou art for ay,
And Savior sweet in whom I do rejoice.
PSALM XXIII.
THE Lord most hie,
I know will be,
An heyrde to me,
I can not long have stresse nor stand in need:
He makes my leare,
In feelds so fare,
That without care
I do repose, and at my pleasure feed.
He sweetly me conuoyes
To pleasant springes,
Where nothing me annoyes,
But pleasure bringes:
He gives my mind
Peace in such kind,
That fear of foes nor force can not me reaue:
By him I am lead
In perfect tread,
And for his Name he will me never leave.
Though I should stay
Even day by day,
In deadly way,
Yet would I be assurde, and fear no ill:
For why? thy grace
In every place
Does me embrace,
Thy rod and shiphirds-crook comforts me still
In despyte of my foe,
My table grows:
Thou balmes my head with joy,
My cup ouer-flowes,
Kindness and grace,
Mercy and peace,
Shall follow me for all my wretched days:
Then endless joy,
Shall me conuoy
To heaven where I with thee shall be always.
PSALM XLIII.
O LORD of grace,
Judge thou my case
From thy high place
My cause revenge against my deadly foes:
From wicked train,
Of fraudfull men,
That thee misken.
Save me, o Lord, for I in thee rejoise:
Thou art my God and aid,
My strength and stay:
Why go I then dismaide,
In this array?
Why should thou me
Reject from thee,
As pray to those that seek my soul to spill?
Send out thy light,
Thy truth and right
And guide my ways unto thy holy hill.
Then will I to,
Thine Altar go,
Not fearing foe:
With Harp in hand to sing thy praise for ever:
My God so dear,
My joy and cheer,
Who do me hear,
With ready help do now my soul deliver:
My soul, why do thou freate
Thus in my breast,
With grudging grief ouer-set,
Not taking rest?
In God most just,
Set all thy trust,
And call on him in all thy stresse and grief:
I will always,
Him laud and praise,
He is my God, my help, my whole relief.
PSALM LVII.
HAVE reuth on me,
Have reuth on me,
O Lord from hie,
Have mercy Lord, in thee my soul does trust:
Until at last,
This stormy blast
Be ouer-past,
In shadow of thy wings my hope shall rest:
On God most high I call
My hearts delight;
Who will his promise all
To me perfect:
From Heavens Throne
He will send down
And save me from the sharp rebuke and shame
Of cruel foes,
That me enclose:
His mercy sure shall keep me from al blame.
I lie beset
With Lions net,
And men are met
In syrie rage my seclie soul to catch:
Whole teeth I ween,
Like arrows keen
Are to be seen,
Their tongues like swords some mischeef for to hatch.
Exalt thy self therefore
The heavens above:
On earth show forth thy glore,
And power prove:
A snare is made.
And grins are laid
My steps to trap, my feet to fold withal:
I am opptest.
A ditche is dressed
For me but lo my foes therein do fall.
My heart is bent
And permanent
With full intent
To praise the Lord and to extol his name:
My tongue always,
Awake I say,
By break of day:
My Harp in haste and Viole do the same.
I will thee praise among
The people all:
As God and Lord most strong
Thee praise I shall:
Thy mercies great,
And truth perfect
Do reach unto the heavens and cloudie sky;
Exalt therefore
Thy Name and glore
Above the clouds and limits of the day.
PSALM XCI.
WHO does confyde,
And so abide,
All time and tide
In secreete and in shade of the most Hie:
He may well say,
God is my stay,
And strength always,
My forth, my hope, in whom my trust does lie
He shall thee keep and sense
From hunters snare:
From cruel Pestilence
And all such feate:
And shall the hide
On every side,
In shadow safe and covert of his wings:
His truethmost sure,
Ay to endure
Thy sheeld shall be against all noisome things.
Thou shall not care,
For any fear,
By night or ear.
Or noonday bright for the swift fleing dart:
No fearful Pest,
That may molest,
By night shall rest
On thee, nor plague by day that falls athwart.
Although a thousand men
Before thine eye,
Yea more then thousands ten,
Should fall hard by:
None ill at all,
Shall thee be fall,
No dangerous death nor dread shall come thee near
But wicked anes,
That God disdaines
He will reward as thou shall see most clear.
Be not affraide,
Sense thou have said,
God is mine aid,
And the most high have set for thy refuge:
No harm nor hurt,
Within thy court
Shall do thee sturt,
No skaith shall come within thy tent to ludge:
For he his Angels bright
Has given command
To keep thee day and night
On every hand;
And by their arm,
To save from harm,
And stay thy steps from stumbling at a stone:
Thou shall down-tread one.
The dragons head,
The Lion, fearce, the Aspes, their young each-
Because the Lord,
Of his accord,
Has said the word
I will him save and send deliverance:
He does adore,
And love my glore:
I will therefore
Him (says the Lord) to honor high advance.
When he shall on me call
In time of need;
I will from dangers all
Rid him with speed:
And him defend,
And succor send
In troubles all, and then him glorify:
I will always,
Prolong his days,
And he doubtless my saving health shall see.
PSALM CI.
NOW will I sing,
To thee, o King,
Above all thing,
Of mercy mixed with judgment righteous:
In perfect way,
I will me stay,
Awaiting ay
Until thou come, my God most gracious:
In mind and heart upright
I will begin
To walk before thy sight
My house within:
No wickedness
Shall me possess,
The sinners work I hate with all disdain:
None ill at all,
Shall with me dwell,
Mine heart, mine hand, from such I will refrain.
Thou froward heart,
That works me smart
From me depart,
Go take thy leave, for I no ill will know:
Such as defame
With slanderous blame
Their neighbors name
I will destroy, and them no mercy show.
The proud presumptuous ghuest
With lofty look,
And hautie mind possessed
I can not brook;
Mine heart, mine eye
Shall ever be
Upon the just, and faithful of the land:
They shall abide
All time and tide
Within thy Court, to serve at thy command.
The man I say,
That does not stray
From the right way,
I will advance in honor to excel:
The guilefull man
That no good can
But lie and feign,
Out of mine house with speed I will expel.
I will cut out by time
Out of the land
All the rebellious train,
And godless band:
And I do mean
For to maintain
Gods holy house and sacred City free,
That wicked men
May not remain
Within his gates for their iniquity.
PSALM CXVII.
ONATIONS all,
Both great and small,
With Israel
Unto the Lord sing laud and lasting praise:
Exalt his Name,
And glorious fame,
Alwhere proclaim
For why? his grace and glore abides always.
He does his tender love
To us extend,
As well each day we prove,
It has no end:
This mighty Lord,
In work and word
Is constant sure, his truth cannot decay:
Give him therefore
All laud and glore.
Who does on us his love and grace display.
PSALM CXXI.
WHEN I behold,
These Montanes cold,
Can I be bold
To take my journey through this wilderness?
Wherein does stand,
On either hand,
A bloody band,
To cut me off with cruel craftiness:
Here subtle Satan's slight,
Does me assaill:
There his proud worldly might
Thinks to preuaill:
In every place,
With pleasant face
The snares of sin besets me round about:
With poysone sweet,
To slay the Spirit,
Conspyred all to take my life no doubt.
But God is he,
Will succor me,
And let me see
His saving bealth ay ready at command:
Even IEHOVA,
That creat al,
Both great and small,
In heaven and air, and in the sea and land.
Freat not my fearful heart,
My breast within,
This God will take thy part
Thy course to rin:
He will thee guide,
Thou shall not slide,
Thy feet shall steadfast stand in the right way:
He will thee keep,
He will not sleep,
Nor suffer soes to catch thee as a pray.
The Lord does keep,
Israel his sheep,
And will not sleep,
Beneath his shadow thou shall saifliely:
Right sure and firm,
With his right arm,
Save the from harm
He shall, and all thy fearful foes defy.
The day hot, Suns offense,
Shall not thee grieve,
Nor cold Moons influence
By night thee move,
God of his grace,
From his high place
Shall save thee from all ill in every way:
Thou goes about,
Both in and out,
He shall thee bless and prosper now and ay.
PSALM CXXV.
AS Sion Hill,
That Is firm and still,
And never will,
Nor can remove, through danger of decays
So that man shall,
Lord with thee dwell,
Fearing no fall,
Who trustes in thee, and, shall endure for ay.
Like Mountains round about
Jerusalem:
IEHOVA so no doubt
Shall cover him:
The rod and yocke
Of Gods own flock
Shall not ay rest upon the godly race:
Lest they through grief,
Without relief
The wandering ways of wicked men embrace.
O Lord our God,
Remove thy rod,
Make not abode
From such as fear thy name with perfect heart:
And walk upright,
Before thy sight,
In thy true light,
Thy grace their guide let not from them depart
But such as slide abacke,
In crooked ways,
The Lord shall overtake,
With sudden frayes:
Their lot and part
Shall be in smart,
With sinful men that perish in thy rage.
With Israel.
Thy peace let dwell
O blessed Lord, to last from age to age,
PSALM CXXVIII.
OBLEST is he
That fears thee,
O Lord most hie,
And does observe thy constant will and way:
O well to him,
That has begun
This course to run;
His labor shall him pleasant fruit repay:
To his great joys increase
In reuthfull need,
IEHOVA will him dress
His life to feed:
His wife shall be
Like to the tree
That grows full gay fast by his houses side:
His children fair,
Like Olyues rare,
His table shall decore both time and tide.
Such man's success,
And happiness.
Shall still increase,
As fears thee, o Lord most righteous:
Thou will not miss,
Right so to bless
Both him and his
With riches rare and pleasure plenteous:
From Sions holy Hill
Thou shall see then
To stand and flourish still
Jerusalem:
Thy race and seed,
Shall budde and breed
Before thine eyes in happy state and store.
With Israel,
And Judah shall
Thy peace, o Lord, abide for ever more.
THE SONG OF SIMEON, S. Luke 2. verse 25.
SINCE that mine eye
Before I die,
O Lord does see
Thine holy one, our hope and only stay:
Whom thou have send,
In latter end
For to extend
Thy mercies great, that do endure for ay:
Then let thy servant Lord,
Depart in peace:
And me of thine accord,
Send to my place,
As thou have said,
And promise made
That can not fail nor fall in vain away:
For I rejoice,
In heart and voice,
That I'haue seen thy saving health this day.
Whom thou a light,
Have set full bright,
Before the sight
Of Ger tiles far and people round about:
And sendst with grace.
Sin to deface,
And glorious peace
For to proclaim, the earth and world throghout
And as thy Prophets told
A sign to be,
For Nations to behold
With faithful eye:
In special,
Thine Israel
To rid from thral, and save them by his might;
That he their glore,
For ever more.
On Sion hill may shine in beauty bright.
GLORIA PATRI.
O King of Kings
In heaven that rings,
Above all things,
Thy people chosen of thine only grace:

Into thy sweet and everlasting peace:

Likewise all praise be to the holy Spirit.
