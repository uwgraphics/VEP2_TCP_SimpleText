.The temple of glass.
Or thought constrynt and grievous heaviness
For pensifhed and high distres
To bed I went now this other night
When that lucina with her pale light
Was Joined last with phoebus in aquarye
Amyd decembre / when of Ianuarye
There be kalendes of the new year
And derk dyane horned and nothing clear
Had her beams under a mysty cloud
With in my bed for cold I began me shroude
Al desolate for constraynt of my woo
The long night walowyng to and fro
Tif at last er I began take keep
Me did oppress a sodeyn dedly sleep
With in the which me thought I was
Rauysshed in spirit in to a temple of glass
I nyste how fer in wilderness
That founded was as by liklynes
Not upon stele / but on a craggy roche
Like yse y frore / and as I did approach
Again the son that shone so clear
As any Cristal and ever ner and ner
As I came nyghe this grisly dredful place
I way astonyed / the light so in my face
Began to smite / so persing ever in one
On every part where that I began gone
That I ne might no thing as I would
About me considere and behold
The wonder estres for brightness of the son
Til act last certain skies done
With wind chaced han her tours y went
To fore the stremes of titan and y blent
So that I might with in and with out
Wherso I would beholden me about
For to report the faco^n and manner
Of all this place that was circuler
In compass wise / round by entayl;e wrought
And when I had long gone and sought
I found a wiket and entered in as fast
In to the temple and mine eyes cast
On every side now low eft alofte
And right anon as I began walken soft
If I the soth a right report shall
I saw depeynted upon a wall
From efte to weste many a fair image
Of sundry lovers like as they were of age
Y set in order after they were true
With lively colors wonder fresh of hue
And as me thought I saw some sit and some stand
And som^e knelyng with bills in their hand
And som^e with compleynt woeful and pietous
With doleful chere to putten to venus
So as she sat fleetyng in the sea
Upon her woo forto have pitee
And first of all I saugh there of cartage
Dido the queen so goodly of visage
That began complain her adventure and cas
How she deceived was of Eneas
For all his hestes and his oaths sworn
And said alas that ever she was born
When she saw that ded she must be
And next I saw the compleynt of Medee
How that she falsed was of Jason
And nygh by venus saw I sit atheon
And all the manner how the boo: him slough
For whom she wept and had pyne enough
There saw I also how that penolope
For she so long her lord ne might see
Was of color both pale and grene
And after next was the fresh queen
I mean al cest the noble true wife
And for admete hou she lost her lif
And for her troth if I shall not lie
How she was turned in to a daysye
There was Grisildes Innocence
And al her mekenes and patience
There was eke Isode and many other moo
And all the torment and the cruel woo
That she had for tristram al her live
And how that Tisbe her heart did ryue
With thilk swerd of sir Piramus
And all the manner hou that Theseus
The mynotaure slow amyd the house
That was forwrynked by craft of dedalus
When he was in prison shit in Crete
And how that philles feste of loves hete
The great fire of demephon allas
And for his falshed and for his trespass
Upon the walls depeynt men might see
How she henge upon a fylberd tree
And many a story moo than I rekene can
Were in the temple / and how that paris wan
The fair Eleyne a lusty fresh queen
And hou Achilles was for Policene
Y slain unwarily withyn Troy town
All this saw I walkyng up and down
There saw I wreton eke the hole tale
How Philomene in to a nyghtyng ale
Y turned was / and proigne unto a swalowe
And how the sabyns in their manner halowe
The feste of lucresse yet in Rome town
There saw I also the sorrow of Palamon
That he in prison felt and all the smert
And how that he through unto his heart
Was hurt unwarily by castyng of an eye
On fair fresh the lusty young Emelye
And all the stryf between him and his brother
And how that one faught with that other
Withyn the grove / til they by Theseus
Accorded were as Chaucer tells us
And furthermore as I began behold
I saw hou phoebus with an arowe of gold
Y wounded was through out his side
Only by envy of the god Cupyde
And how that dyane unto a laurer tree
Y turned was when that she did fle
And how that Jove changed his cope
Only for love of the fair Eurepe
And in to a bole / when he did he fue
List of his godhed his form to transmue
And hou that he by transmutacion
The shap began take of Amphitrion
For Alcumena so passing was of beauty
So was he hurt for all his deyte
With louys dart / and might it not escape
There saw I also how mars was take
Of vulcanus and with venus found
And with the cheynes Inuysible bound
There was also all the poesye
Of him Mercurye and all the philogye
And how that she for her sapience
Y wedded was to the god of eloquence
And how that Muses lowly did obey
High in to heuyn this lady to conueye
And with her song hou she was magnefied
With Iubiter there to be stellefied
And vppermore depeynt men might see
How with her ryng the goodly canece
Of every fawle / the leydons and song
Could understand as she walked them among
And hou her brother so often helped was
In his myschief / by the stead of bras
And furthermore in the temple were
Full many a thousand lovers here and there
In sundry wise ready to complain
Unto the goddess / of her woo and pain
How they were hyndred some for envy
And how the serpent of falls Jealousy
Full many a lover has put a back
And causeles on them have leid a lack
And som^e there were that playned on absence
That were exiled and put out of presence
Through wicked tunges and falls suspeco^n
Without mercy or any remissio^n
And other eke her seruyse spent in veyn
And of her lady were not loved ageyn
And other eke that for pouerte
Dursten in no wise her great aduersite
Discouere ne opene / left they were refused
And som^e for wantyng also were accused
And other eke that loved secretly
And of her lady durst axe no mercy
Lest that she would of him have despyte
And som^e also that putten right great wite
Ou double lovers that love things new
Through whose falsenes hyndred be the true
And some there were as hit is often found
That for her lady many a blody wound
Endured has in many a regyon
Whiles that an other has had possession
Al of his lady and bears a way the fruit
Of his labor and of all his fuyt
And other compleyned of richesse
How he with tresour does his business
To win against al kind and right
Where as true lovers have force none ne might
And some there were as maydyns young of age
That pleyneth so with pipyng and with rage
That were coupled again al nature
With crooked elde that may not long endure
For to perform the lust of loves play
For hit ne sit not unto fressh may
For to be coupled to old Ianuarye
They be so diverse that they must varye
For elde is gruoching and malencolious
Ay full of ire and suspecious
And yongth entendeth to Joy and lustynes
To mirth and play and to al gladness
Allas that ever hit should fall
So sweet fugre y coupled be to galle
These young folk cryeden often sith
And praid venus her power to kythe
Upon this myschief and shape remedy
And right anon I herd other cry
With sobbyng teres and pietous sowo^
To fore the goddess by lamentacion
That were constrained in their yougihe
And in childhode as is often coutle
Y entrid were in to Religion
Or they had yeris of discresco^n
That al her lif can not but complain
In wide Copes perfection forto feyne
Full covertly for to coueren their smert
And show the contrary of their heart
Thus saw I weep many a fair maid
That on their friends all the wit they laid
And other next I saw there in great rage
That they were married in their tender age
With out fredom of fre election
Where leave has selde domynacion
For love at large and at liberte
Would freely chese and not with such trete
And other saw I full often weep and wrynge
That they in men fond such varyynge
To leave a season while that beaulte flourith
And after by disdayn so ungoodly lourith
On her that whylom he called his lady dear
That was to him so playsant and entier
But lust with fairnes is so over goon
That in her heart truth abides noon
And som^e also I saw in teres reyne
And pietously on god and kind pleyne
That ever they would on any creature
So much beauty passing be mesure
Set on a woman to give occasion
A man / to love to his confusion
And namely there / where he shall have no grace
For with a look forth by as he does pace
Full often falls through castyng of an eye
Aman is wounded that he must nedis deye
That never peraunter after he shall her set
Why will god don so great a cruelte
To any man / or to his creature
To make him so much woo endure
For her / percas / whom he shall in no wise
Rejoice never / but so forth in Iuyse
Led his lif til that he be grave
For he ne durst of her no mercy crave
And eke paunter though he durst and would
He can not wite where he her find should
I saw there eke / and thereof had I routhe
That some were hyndred by couetyse and slougthe
And som^e also for their hastynes
And other eke for their rechesesnes
But altherlast as I walked and beheld
Beside passas with her Cristal sheld
Tofore the statue of venus set on height
There kneled a lady in my sight
To fore the goddess / which as the son
Passes the sterris / and eke the stormys done
And lucifer to wide the nyghtes sorow^
In clerenes passes erly the morrow
And so as may has the souereynte
Of every month the fayrnes and beauty
And as the Rose in swetnes and odor
Surmounted flouris / and bame of al licour
Has the pryse / and as the rubye bright
Of al stones in beauty and in sight
As it is know has the Regalye
Right so this lady with her goodly eye
And with the stremys of her look so bright
Surmounteth al thourgh beauty in my sight
That for to tell her great semelines
Her womanhed her port and her fairnes
Hit was a marvel / how ever that nature
Cowde in her works make a creature
So angelyk so goodly on to see
So femynyn or passing of beauty
Whose sonnysh here brighter than goldwire
Lyche phoebus beams shynyng in his spyre
The goodlihed eke of her fresh face
So replenyshed of beauty and of grace
So well ennewed by nature and depeynt
As Rose and lilyes to gyder were meynt
So egally by good proporcion
That as me tought by mine inspection
I began meruaylle hou god or werk of kind
Mighten of beauty such a tresour find
To yeuen her so passing excellence
For in good faith through her hye presence
The temple was enlumyned enuyron
And forto speak of her condition
She was the best that might be on five
For there was none yt with her might strive
To speak of bounte or of gentilesse
Of womanhede or of lowlynesse
Of curtoysie or of goodlihede
Of speech of chere or of semelihede
Of poort benign or of daliaunce
The best taught and thereto of playsaunce
She was the well eke of honest
An Examplair and mirror eke was she
Of secretnes of truth of feith fulness
And to all other lady and maistres
To show virtue who so list to lere
And so this lady right humble of chere
Kneling I saw / clad in grene and white
To fore venus goddess of al delight
Enbrowded al with stones and perre
So richely that Joy it was to see
With sundry rolls on her garnement
For texpowne the troth of her intent
To show fully that for her humblesse
And for her virtue and her stablenesse
That she was rote of al womanly playsance
Therefore her word without variance
Enbrowded was as men might see
De mieulx en mieulx with stones of perre
This is to said that she was so benygne
From better to better her heart does resign
And al her will to venus the goddess
When that her fist her harms to redress
For as me thought somewhat by her chere
For to complain she had great desire
For in her hand she held a lityl bylle
For to declare the sum^e of al her will
And to the goddess her quarrel for to show
Theffect of which was in words few
.The copye of the supplicacion.
O lady venus mother of cupyde
That in this world have the governance
And hertes hye that hawteyn be by pride
Enclynest mekely to thyn obeyssance
Causer of Joy Resees of penance
And with thy stremes can every thing discern^
Through heavenly fire of love that is etern^
O blesful sterre persaunt and full of light
Of beams gladsom / deuoyder of derknes
Chief recomfort after the blak night
To void woeful hertes out of their heaviness
Take now good head lady and goddess
So that my bille may your grace attain
Redress to find of that I me complain
For I am bound to thing that I nolde
Freely to chese thar lack I liberte
And so I want of that mine heart would
The body is knyt / though my thought be fre
So that I must of necessite
My hertes list outward contrary
Though we be oon the deed must varye
My worship sauf I faylle election
Again al right both of god and kind
Thereto be knyt under subjection
For whens for both ar out of mind
My thought goth forth my body is behind
For I am here / and yond my remembrance
Between two so hang I in balance
Deuoyde of Joy / of woo I have plente
What I desire / that may I not possede
For that I nolde is ready ay to me
And that I love / for to sue I dread
To my desire contrary is my mede
And thus I stand departed in tweyne
Of will and deed ylaced in a cheyne
For though I brenne with feruence and hete
Withyn mine heart I mote complain of cold
And by excess though I swelte and sweet
Me to complain god wot I am not bold
Unto no wight / ner one word unfold
Of al my pain / allas the hard stounde
The hotter that I brenne / ye colder is my wound
For he that has mine heart feythfully
And hool my love in all honest
Without change al be hit secretly
I have no space with him for to be
O lady venus consider now and see
Unto theffecte and compleynt of my byff
Since life and death I put all in thy will
And tho me thought the gods did enclyne
Mekely her head and softly began express
That in short time her torment should fine
And how of him for whom al her distress
Contynned had and al her heaviness
She should have Joy and of her purgatory
Be helped sone and so live forth in glory
And said daughter for thy sad truth
Thy faithful menyng and Innocence
That planted be with outen any slouthe
In your person deuoyed of al offense
So han they atteyned to our audience
That with our grace ye shall be was releuyd
I you behete of all that has you greuyd
And for that ye be ever of one intent
Without change or mutabilyte
And in your pains ben so pacient
To take lowly your aduersyte
And that so long through the cruelte
Of old saturn my fader vnfoztuned
Your woo shall now no longer be contuned
And thinks this with in a litil while
Hit shall a swage and over passen sone
For men by laysir passen many a mile
And often after a droppyng moan
The weder clereth / and when ye storm is done
The son shyneth in his spyer bright
And Joy waketh when woo is putto flight
Remember eke how never yet not wight
Ne came to worship with out some debate
And folk rejoice also more of light
That they with derknes were waped and mate
No man^s chan^ce is allewey fortunate
Ne no wight preyseth of sugre the swetnes
But they to fore have tasted bitterness
Gryssyld was asayed at full
That turned after to encrese of Joy
Penolope began eke for sow was dulle
For that her lord abode so long at troy
Also the torment there could noman accore
Of dorygene flour of al Bretaigne
Thus ever Joy is fyn and end of pain
And trusts this for conclusion
The end of sorrow is Joy void of dread
For hoolly seyntes through her passion
Have heuyn won by their souerain mede
And plente gladly follows after need
And so my daughter after your greuaunce
I you behote ye shall have full plesaunce
For ever of love the manner and the gyse
Is for to hurt his servant and to wound
And when he has taught them his empryse
He can in Joy make them to habounde
And since that ye have in my laas be bound
With out grucching or rebellyon
Ye must of right have consolacion
This to said dowteth never a deel
That ye shall have full possession
Of him that ye now cherisshe so weel
In honest manner with out offencion
By cause I know your entencion
Is truly sect in party and in all
To love him best and most in special
For he that ye have chosen you to serve
Shall be to you such as ye desire
With out change fully til he sterue
So with my bronde I have set him a fire
And with my grace I shall him so enspyre
That he m heart shall be right at your wysse
Wherso you list to save him or to spylle
For unto you I shall his heart so low
With out spotte of any doblenesse
That he ne shall escape from the bow
Though that him self by unsteadfastness
I mean of cupide that shall him so distress
Unto your hand with tharowe of gold
That he ne shall escapen thaugh he Bold
And since ye list of pity and of grace
In virtue only his yonghthe to cherisshe
I shall by aspectes of my benign face
Make him teschewe every sin and Vice
So that he shall have no manner spice
In his courage to leave things new
He shall to you so plain be found and true
And when this goodly fair fressh of hue
Humble and benygne of troth crop and rote
Conceived had how venus began to rewe
On her prayer plainly to do bote
To change her bitter actones in to sote
She fyl on knees of high devotion
And in this wise began her orison
Highest of hye queen and Emperier
Goddess of love / of good yet the best
That through your beauty without vice
Whylom conquered thappel act fest
That Iubiter through his hye request
To ass the gods above celestyal
Made in his pasais most Imperyal
To you my sady vpholder of my fyfMekesy I thank so as I may suffice
That ye list now with heart ententyf
So graciously for me to deuyse
That Whyse I syue with humble sacrefise
Upon your auters your fest yer by yer
I shall encence casten in to the fire
For of your grace I am full reconsiled
From every troble unto joy and ease
That sowes ass be from me exised
Since ye my lady list now tappease
My pains of de and fully my disease
Unto gladness so suddenly to borne
Having no cause from hens forth to morn
For sithen ye so mekely list to daunte
To my seruise him that loves me best
And of your bounte so graciously to grant
That he ne shall varye though him lest
Whereof mine heart is fully brought to rest
For now and ever o lady mine benign
That heart and wit I holy to you resign
Thankyng you with all my full heart
That of your grace and visitacion
So humble list him to convert
Fully to ben at my subjection
With out change or transmutacion
Unto his last / now laud and reverence
Be to your name and excellence
This al and sum and chief of my request
And hool substance of my full entente
You thankyng ever of your grant and best
Both now and ever that ye me grace sent
To conquer him that never shall repent
Me for to serve and humblye for to please
As fynal tresour of my hertes ease
And than anon venus cast a down
In to her lap brauches white and grene
Of hawthorn that wenten enuyron
About her heed that joy was to seen
And bad her keep hem honestly and clean
Which should not fade ne never weye old
If she her biddyng keep as she has told
And as these bows be both fair and sweet
Follow theffecte that they do speciafye
This is to seyne both in cold and hete
Be ye of one heart and of one fantasye
As ar these leaves which may not dye
By no duresse of storms that be kene
No More in Winter than in somer grene
Right so by ensample of well or woo
For Joy torment or for aduersite
Whether so fortune favor / or be foo
For pouert riches or prosperyte
That ye your heart keep in on degree
To love him best for no thing that ye fine
Whom I have bound so low under your cheyne
And with yt word the goddess shoke her heed
And was m pees and spack as tho no more
And therewith all full femynyn of dread
Me thought this lady sighen began full sore
And said again / lady that may restore
Hertes in Joy from their aduersite
To do your will de mieulxr en mieuly ma gree
Thus ever slepyng dremyng as I lay
Withyn the temple me thought I say
Great prees of folk with murmur wonderful
To croude and shoue / the temple was so full
Euerich full besy / in his own cause
That I n^ may shortly in a clause
Discriuen all the rites and the guyse
And eke I want connyng to deuyse
How som^e there were with blood encence and milk
And som^e with flouris sote and soft as silk
And som^e with sparowes and douues white
That for to offren began hem delight
Unto the goddess with sighe and prayer
Hem to relese of that they most desire
That for the prees shortly to conclude
I went my way for the multitude
Me for to refressh out of the prees all one
And by my self me thought as I began gone
With in the estres and began a While tarry
I saw a man that walked al solitarye
That as me seemed for heaviness and dole
Him to pompleyne / that he walked so sole
With out espyyng of any other wight
And if I shall discryuen him a right
If that he had not ben in heaviness
Me thought he was / to speak of semelines
Of shap of form / and also of stature
The most passing / that ever yet nature
Made in her works / and like to be a man
And there with all as I reherce can
Of face and chere the most gracyous
To be biloued happy and ewrous
But as it seemed outward by his chere
That he complained for lack of his desire
For by him self as he walked up and down
I herd him make a lamentacion
And said alas, what thing may this be
That now am bond that whylom was fre
And went at large at mine election
Now am I caught under subjection
For to become a very homager
To god of love / where er I came here
Felt in mine heart / naught of loves pain
But now of new / within hur fiery cheyne
I am embraced so that I may not strive
To serve and love While I am on live
The godly fresh in the temple yonder
I saw right now / that I had wonder
How ever god / for to rekene all
Might make a thing so celestial
So angelike on earth to appear
For with the stremes of her eyes clear
I am wounded even to the heart
That fro the death I may not astert
And most I marvel that so sodemly
I was so yolde to be at hur mercy
Without more / I must her lust obey
Whether that she list me to syue or deye
And take mekely my sodeyn adventure
For since my lif / my death / and eke my cure
Is in her hand it will not auaylle
To grucche again / for of this bataylle
The palm is heris / and plainly the victory
If I rebellid honor none ne glory
I might not in any wise achyeue
Since I am yolden / how should I theme preue
To run a wey / I wot hit will not be
Though I be loos / at large I may not fle
O god of love how sharp is now thyn arowe
How may thou now so cruelly and so narowe
With out couse hurt me and wound
And take none head my sorrows to found
But liche a bird that flees at her desire
Till suddenly withyn the pantere
She is caught thaugh late she was at large
Anewe tempest forcasteth now my barge
Now up now down / with wynd it is so blow
So am I possed and almost overthrow
For drive in derknes of many sundry wawe
Alas when shall this tempest ouerdrawe
To clear the skies of mine aduersite
The lode sterre when that I ne may see
Hit is so hid with clouds that he blake
Alas when will this torment ouerslake
I can not wit / for who is hurt of new
And bledeth inward til he wex pale of hue
And has his wound un warly fressh and grene
And hit is not couthe unto the harms kene
Of mighty cupyde that can so hertes daunte
That no man may in his war him vaunte
To get a price but only by mekenes
For there ne vayleth stryf ne sturdynes
So may I said that with a look am yolde
And have no power to strive thaugh I would
Thus stand I ever betwix lif and death
To love and serve while I have breath
In such a place where I dar not pleyne
Liche him that is in torment and in pain
And knows not to whom to discure
For there that I have holly set my cure
I dar not well for dread ne for danger
And for unknown tellen how the fire
Of loves bronde is kyndlid in my breast
Thus am I murdered and slain act les^e
So privily wrthyn my thought
O lady venus whom I have sought
So wysse me now what me is best to do
That am distraught with my self so
That I ne Bote what way for to torn
Sauf by my self soleyn for to morn
Hangyng in balance betwix hope and dread
With out comfort remedy or read
For hope bids pursue and assaye
And agaynward dread answerth nay
And now with hope I am set a lofte
But dread and danger hard and nothing soft
Has overthrow my trust and put a down
Now at my large / now fetred in prisoun
Now in torment / now in souerayn glory
Now in paradyse and now in purgatory
As man dispayred in a double were
Born up with hope / and then^e anon danger
Me draws aluck / and says it shall not be
For where as I of mine aduerfite
Am bold somwhyle mercy to require
Themie comes despair and gymieth me to lere
A new lesson to hope full the contrary
They be so diverse they will do me varye
And thus I stand dismayed in a trance
For when that hope were likly me tauaunce
For dread I tremble and dar one word not speak
And if hit so be / that I not out break
To tell the harms that greuen me so sore
But in my self encrece them more and more
And to be slain fully me delight
When of my death she is nothing to wit
For but if she my constreynt plainly knew
How shald she ever / on my peynes rue
Thus often time with hope I am meuyd
To tell her all / how I am greuyd
And to be hardy on me for to take
To axe mercy / but dread does me then^e awake
And than wanhop answerth me again
That better were than she have disdayn
To dye attones unknow of any wight
And there with all bids hope anon right
Me / to be bold and prayen her of grace
And fith all virtues be portreyd in her face
Hit were not sittyng / that pity were behind
And right anon withyn my self I find
A new plee brought on me with dread
That me so maseth that I see no speed
Be cause he says that stonyeth al my blood
I am so simple and she is so good
Thus hope and dread in me will not sece
To plete and strive my harmys to entrect
But at hardest yet or I be deed
Of my distress since I can no read
But stand dom^ still as any stone
To fore the goddess I will me haste anon^
And complain with out more sermon^
Though death be fyn and full conclusion
Of my request / yet I will assaye
And right anon me thought I say
This woeful man as I have memory
Full lowly enter in to an oratorye
And knelid a down in full humble wise
To fore the goddess and began anon deuyse
His pitous quarrel with a doleful there
Sayng right this as ye shall here
.The compleynt of the man.
Redress of sorrow O Citherea
That with the stremys of thy playsaunt hete
Gladest the mount of al Cirrea
Where thou have chosen thy paleys and sete
Whose bright beams ben wesshen and wete
In the river of Elycon the well
Have now pity of that I shall you tell
And not desdayne ye of your benygnyte
My mortal woo O lady mine goddess
Of grace and bounte and mercyful pity
Benygnely to help and to redress
And thaugh so be I can not well express
The grievous harms that I feel in my heart
Have never yet the less mercy of my smerte
This is to said O cler heuenes light
That next the son sereled han your spear
Since ye me hurt with your dredful might
By influence of your beams clear
And that I by your seruyse now so dear
As ye me brought in to this maladye
Be ye gracyous and shape ye remedy
For in you hoolly bieth help of all this ^^as
And know best my sorrow and al my pain
For dread of death / how I ne dar all as
To axen mercy ones / ne me complain
Now with your fire her heart so constrayne
With out more / or I deye at lest
That she may wit what is my request
How I no thing in all this world desire
But for to serve fully to mine end
That goodly fresh so womanly of there
Without change while I have life and mind
And that ye would such grace send
Of my seruyse that she not disdeyne
Sithen her to serve I may not me restreyne
And since that hope me has give hardynes
To love her best and never to repent
Whylis that I live with all my lesynes
To dread and serve / thaugh danger never assente
And here upon ye know mine entente
How I have vowed fully in mine mind
To ben her man / thaugh I no mercy find
For in my heart emprynted is so sore
Her shap her form and al her semelynes
Her port her chere / her godenes more and more
Her womanhed and eke her gentiles
Her trough / her faith and her kyndnes
With all virtues each set in her degree
There is no lack / saving only of pity
Her sad demenyng of will not variable
Of look benygne / and rote of al plesance
And eyemplayre to all that will be stable
Discrete prudent of wisdom fuffisance
Mirror of wit ground of governance
A world of beauty compassed in her face
Whose persant look does through my heart race
And over this wonder secret and true
A well of fredome and right bounteous
And ever encrecyng in virtue new and new
Of speech goodly / and wonder gracyous
Deuoyd of pride / to pour not despytous
And if that I shortly shall not feyne
Save upon mercy I no thing complain
What wonder the nne / though I be with dread
Inly supprised for to axen grace
Of her that is quence of womanhede
For well I wot in so high a place
Hit will not be / therefore I over pace
And take lowly what woe I ordure
Til she of pity me take to her cure
But one auowe plainly here I make
That whethir so be / she do me live or deye
I will not grucche / but humbly hit take
And thank god and wilfully obey
For by my troth my heart shall never reneye
For life ne death mercy ne danger
Of will and thought to be at her desire
To ben as true as ever was antonyus
To cleopatre while him lasts breath
Or unto thesbe young Piramus
That was faithful found / til them deptid death
Right so shall I til Antropos me sleth
For whele or woo her faithful man be found
Unto my last / like as my heart is bound
To love as well as did Achilles
Unto his last the fair Polixene
Or as the great famous Hercules
For dyanyre that felt the shot kene
Right so shall I say right as I mean
While that I live / her both dread and serve
For lack of mercy though she do me sterue
Now lady venus to whom nothing unknow
Is in the world hid / ne naught may be
For there nys thing nether hye ne low
May be conceyled from your pryuete
Fro whom my menyng is not now secree
But wite fully that mine intent is true
And liche my truth now on my pain rue
For more of grace than of presumpcion
I axe mercy / and no thing of dute
Of lowly humbles / with out offencion
That ye enclyne of your benygnyte
Your audience unto my humylyte
To grant me that to you I clep^ and call
Sum day relees yet of my peynes all
And since ye have the guerdon and the mede
Of all lovers plenily in your hand
Now of grace and pity take ye head
Of my distrees / that am under your bond
So lowly bound / as ye well understand
In that place where I took first my wound
Of pity suffer ye my health may be found
That liche as she me hurt with a sight
Right so with health late me hur sustene
And as the stremes of her eyes bright
Whylom my heart with wounds sharp and kene
Through persed have and yet be fresh and grene
So as she me hurt / let her me socoure
Or ellis certain I may not long endure
For lack of speech I can say you no more
I have matter but I can not pleyne
My wit is dull to tell al my sore
A mouth I have / And yet for all my peyn
For want of words I may not now atteyn
To tell half / that does my heart grieve
Mercy abydyng / til she me list releue
But this theffect of my matter fynal
With death or mercy relees for to find
For heart body thought life lust and al
With all my reason and al my full mind
And five wits of on assent I bind
To her seruyse with out any stryf
And make her pryncesse of my death or life
And now I pray of routh and eke pity
O goodly planet / O lady venus bright
That ye your sone of his deyte
Cupide I mere that with his dredful might
And with his brond that is so clear of light
Her heart so to fire and to mark
As ye me whylom brent with a spark
That euerlich and with the same fire
She may be hit / as I now brenne and melte
So that her heart be flamed with desire
That she may know by feruence hou I swelte
For of pity plainly if she felt
The self hete that does mine heart enbruce
I hope of routh she will do me grace
And there with all venus as me thought
Toward this man full benyngely
Began cast her eye / like as that she rought
Of his disease / and said full goodly
Since it is so / that thou so humbly
With out grucchyng our hestes list obey
Toward thyn help I will anon pourueye
And eke my sone Cupyde that is so blind
He shall be helpyng fully to perform
Your hool desire / that nothing be behind
Ne shall be left / so we shall reform
This pietous co^pleynt / yt makes the to morn
That she for whom thau sorowest most in heart
Shall through hur mercy relece al thy smert
When she sees time / through our purueaunce
Be not to hasty / but suffer althing well
For in abydyng / through lowly obeyssaunce
Lies full redres / of all that ye now feel
And she shall be as true as any stele
To you allone / by our might and grace
If ye list mekely abide a lityl space
But understand ye that al her cherising
Shall be grounded upon honest
That no wight shall by any compacyng
Demen amys of hur in no degree
For neither mercy / routh ner pity
She shall not have ne take of the non head
Further than longs unto her womanhede
Be not astonyed of no wilfulnes
Ne not despeyred of this dissolucion
Late reason bridle lust by buxumnes
Without grucchyng or rebellyon
For joy shall follow all this passion
For who can suffer torment and endure
Ne may not faylle / but follow shall his cure
For to fore all she shall the louen best
So shall I her without offencion
By Influence enspire in her breast
In honest wise with full entencion
For tenclyne by clean affection
Her heart fully on the to have routhe
Be cause I know that thou menest truth
Go now to her where as she stant a side
With humble chere / and put the in her grace
And al beforn let hope be thy guide
And thaugh that dread would with the pace
Hit sits well / but look that thou a race
Out of thyn heart wanhop and despeire
To her presence er thou have repeir
And mercy first shall thy way make
And honest menyng before do thy message
To make pity in her heart a wake
And secretnes to further thy viage
With humble port to her that is so sage
Shall menes be / and I my self also
Shall the fortune / or thy tale be do
Go forth anon / and be right good of chere
For specheles nothing may thou speed
Be good of trust and be no thing in were
Since I my self shall helpen in this need
For at lest of her goodly head
She shall to the her audience enclyne
And low the to her til thou thy tale fine
For well thou wost if I shall not feyne
Without speech thou may no mercy have
For who that will of his pryue pain
Fully be cured his life to help and save
He must mekely out of his heart grave
Discure his wound and show hit his leche
Or ellis deye for defaute of speech
For he that is in myschief reklees
To seche help I hold him a wrecche
And she ne may thyn heart bring in pees
But if thy compleynt to her heart strecche
Would thou be cured and wilt no salve fecche
Hit will not be / for no wight may atteyne
To come to blys / if he list live in pain
Therefore attones go forth in humble wise
To fore thy lady and lowly knele a down
And in all truth thy words so deuyse
That she on the have compassion
For she that is of so hye renoun
In all virtues as queue and souerayn
Of womanhed shall rue on thy pain
And when the gods this lesson had told
About me so I began behold
Right so a stoned stood in a trance
To se the manner and contenance
And all the chere of this woeful man
That was of hue dedely pale and wan
With dread supprised in his own thought
Making chere as thaugh he rought naught
Of life ne death ne what so him betyde
So much fere he had on every side
To put him forth to tell his pain
Unto his lady / other to complain
What woo he felt torment or disese
What dedely sorrow his heart did sese
For routh of which his woe as I endite
My pen I feel quaken as I write
Of him I had so great compassion
For to reherce his weymentacion
That uneath / though I with my self strive
I want cnnyng his peynes to discryue
Allas to whom shall I for help call
Not to the muses for cause they ben all
Help of right in Joy and not in weo
And in matiers that they delight also
Wherefore they nyl as now direct my style
Nor me enspiren Alas the hard while
I can no further but to the siphon
And to her suster to call help upon
That be goddesses of torment and pain
Now let your teris in to mine Ink reyne
With woeful words my paper for to blotte
This woeful matter not to peynt / but spotte
To tell the manner of this dredeful man
Upon his complaynt when he first began
To tell his lady when he began declare
His hid sorowis / and his euel fare
That at his heart constreyned so sore
The ffect of which was this without more
Pryncesse of yougth and flour of gentilesse
Ensample of virtue ground of curtesye
Of beauty rote queen and eke maistres
To all women how they shall hem gye
And sothfast mirror texemplifye
The right way of port and of womanhede
What I shall say / of mercy take ye head
Besechyng first unto your hye nobles
With quakyng heart of my Inward dread
Of grace and pity and not of right wysnes
Of berrey routhe to help in this need
This is to say O well of goodly head
That I ne relike thaugh ye do me deye
So ye list first to heren what I seye
The dredeful stroke the geret force and might
Of god cupide that noman may rebelle
So inwardly through out mine heart right
Y perced has that I ne may councele
Mine hid wound ne I ne may apele
Unto no gretter / this mighty god so fast
You to serve has me bound unto my last
That heart and all with out stryf ar yolde
For life or death to your seruyse allone
Right as the goddess mighty venus would
To for her mekely when I made my moan
She me constrained without change anon
To your seruyse and never for to feign
Wherso ever ye list to do me ease or pain
So that I can no thing but mercy cry
Of you my lady / and change for no new
That ye list godely to fore er that I dye
Of verray routhe upon my pains rue
For by my truth / and ye my peynes knew
What is the cause of mine aduersite
On mine disese ye would have pity
For unto you true and eke secre
I will be found to serve as I best can
And therewith al as lowly in each degree
To you be allone as ever yet was man
Unto his lady from the time I began
And shall so forth withouten any sleuth
Whylis that I live / by god and by my troth
For lever I had to deyen suddenly
Than you offend in any manner wise
And suffer pains inward privily
Than my seruyse as now ye should dispyse
For I right neught will axe in no wise
But for your servant ye would me accept
And when I trespace / goodly me correct
And for to grant of mercy the prayer
Only of grace and womanly pity
From day to day that I might lere
You for to plese / and therewith all that ye
When I do mys / list for to teache me
In your seruyse hou that I may amend
From hensforth and never you offend
For unto me it does ynowh suffyse
That for your man ye would me resseyue
Fully to ben as you list deuyse
And as ferforth as my wits can conceive
And therewith al liche as ye preue
That I be true / to guerdone me of grace
Or ell is to punysshe after my trespace
And if so be that I may not atteyne
Unto your mercy / yet grant at the least
In your seruyse for all my woe and pain
That I may deyen after my beheste
This is al and some the fyn of my request
Outher with mercy your servant to save
Or mercyles that I may be begraue
And when this benygne of her intent true
Conceived has the compleynt of this man
Right as the fresh rody Rose new
Of her color to wexen she began
Her blood astoned so from ler heart ran
In to her face of verray femynyte
Through honest dread abashed was she
And humbly she began her eyes cast
Toward him of her benygnyte
So that no word by her lips past
For have nor dread mercy ne pity
For so demened she was in honest
That unadvised no thing fro her stert
So much of reason was compassed in her heart
Til at last of which she did abreyd
When she is truth and menyng did feel
And unto him full goodly spack and said
Of your behest and your menyng well
And your seruyse so faithful euerydele
Which unto me so lowly now ye offer
With all my heart / I thank you of your profre
That for so much your intent is set
Only in virtue y bridled under dread
Ye must of right nedis fare the bet
Of your request / and the better speed
But as for me I may of womanhede
No further grant to you in mine entente
Than as my lady venus will assente
For she well knows I am not at my large
To done right naught but by her ordynance
So am I drowned under her dredeful charge
Her list tobbeye without variaunce
But for my part so hit be pleasaunce
Unto the goddess for troth in your empryse
I you accept fully to my seruyse
For she my heart has in subjection
Which hoolly is youres and never shall repent
In thought ner deed in mine election
Witness on venus that knows mine intent
Fully tobeye her dome and Judgment
So as her list disposen and ordeyne
Right as she knows the troth of us tweyne
For unto the time that venus list provide
To shape a way for our hertis ease
Both ye and I mekely must abide
To take at gree / and not of our disease
To grucche again til that she list tappease
Our hid woo so July that constreyneth
From day to day and our hertis peyneth
For in abidyng of woo and al affraye
Who so can suffer is founden remedy
And for the best full often is made delay
Er men be heled of their maladye
Wherefore as venus list this matter to gye
Leet us agreen / and take al for the best
Til her list / sect both our hertes in rest
For she is that byndeth and can constreyn
Hertes in one / this fortunate planete
And can relece lovers of her peyn
To turn fully her bicter in to sweet
Now blisful gods down fro thy sterey sete
Us to fortune cast your stremes shene
Like as ye know / that we troth mean
And there with all as I mine eyes cast
For to perceive the manner of these tweyne
To fore the goddess mekely as they paste
Me thought I saw with a goldyn cheyne
Venus / anon enbrace and constreyne
Her both hertes in one / for to persevere
Whilis that they live / and never to disseuere
Seeing right thus with a benygne chere
Since it is so / ye be under my might
My will is thus / that ye my daughter dear
Full accept this man as it is right
Unto your grace anon here in my sight
That ever has been so lowly you to serve
Hit is good skill your thank that he deserve
Your honor sauf and eke your womanhede
Him to cherisshe / hit sits you right well
Since he is bound under hope and dread
Amyd my cheyne that forged is of stele
Ye must of mercy shape that he feel
In you some grace of his long seruyse
And that in have lik as I shall deuyse
This is to sayn that ye taken head
Hou he to you most faithful is and true
Ofal your servants / and nothing for his mede
Of you ne asks / but ye on him rue
For he vowed has to change for no new
For life ne death / for joy ne for pain
Ay to be youris / so as ye list ordeyne
Wherefore ye must or else it were wrong
Unto your grace fully him receive
In my presence / by cause he has so long
Holy ben youris / as ye may conceive
That from your mercy / if ye him weyue
I will my silf recorden cruelte
In your person / and great lack of pity
Late him for his troth find than again
For long seruyse / guerdon him with grace
And late ye pity weye down his pain
For time is now danger to arace
Out of your heart / and mercy in to pace
And love for love world well beseme
To give again and this I plainly deem
And as for him I will ben his borowe
Of lowlithede and besy attendance
How he shall be both eve and morrow
Full diligent to done his observance
And ever awaytyng / you to do playsance
Wherefore my sone / listen and take heed
Fully tobeye / as I shall the read
And first of all my will is that thou be
Feithful in heart and constant as a wall
True humble. meke and therewith al secre
With out change in party or in all
And for no torment that the fallen shall
Tempest the not / but ever in stedfastnes
Rote thyn heart / and void doublenes
And furthermore have in reverence
These women al for thy lady sake
And suffer never that men hem do offense
For love of one / but evermore undertake
Hem to defend whether they sleep or wake
And ay be ready to holden them party
Against all tho that to hem have envy
Be curtais ay and lowly of thy speech
To rich and pour ay fressh and well beseyn
And ever besy weyes for to seche
All true lovers to relece of her peyn
Since thou art one / and of no wight have disdeyn
For love has power hertes for to daunte
And never for cherising / the to much auaunte
Be lusty eke void of all tristesse
And take no thought but ever be iocound
And not to pensif for none heaviness
And with thy gladness / let sadness ay be found
When woo approached / let mirth most habound
As manhod ayid / and though you feel smert
Late not to many known of thyn heart
And all virtues besily thou sue
Vices eschew for the love of one
And for no tales thyn heart not remewe
Word is but wynd that shall soon ouergoon
What ever thou here be domb as any stoon
And to answer to sone / not the delight
For here she stands that all this shall ye quyte
And wherther thou be absent or in presence
None others beawte let in thy heart mine
Since I have give her of beauty excellence
Above al other in virtue for to shine
And think hou in fire men ar wont to fine
This pured gold to put hit in assaye
So to the prove / thou art put in delay
But time shall come thou shall for thy suffrance
Be well a paid and take for thy mede
Thy lives joy and al thy suffisance
So that good hope al way thy bridel led
Let no dispeir hyndre the with dread
But ay thy trust upon her mercy ground
Since none but she may thy sorrow sound
Each hour and time. weke. day and year
Be liche faithful and vary not for lyte
Abide a while and than of thy desire
The time neygheth that shall the most delight
And late no sorrow in thy heart byte
For no differring / since thou for thy mede
Shall rejoice in pees the flour of womanhede
Think hou she is this world is son and light
The sterre of beauty the flour eke of fairnes
Both ^op and rote and eke the rubye bright
Hertes to glade / y troubled with derknes
And hou I have made her / thin hertes Empress
Be glad therefore to be under her bond
Now come ner daughter and take him by the hond
Unto this syn that aftir all these shouris
Of his torment he may be glad and light
When by your grace ye take him to be youris
For enermore anon here in my sight
And eke I will also as hit is right
Without more his langour for to lysse
In my presence anon that ye him kiss
That there may be of al your old smertis
A full relees under joy assured
And that one lok be of your both hertis
Shet with my keye of gold so well pured
Only in sign that ye have recured
Your hool desire here in this holy place
Within my temple now in the year of grace
Eternally be bound of assurance
The knot is knyt / that may not be unbound
That all the gods of this aliaunce
Satorne. Jove. and Mars as it is found
And eke Cupyde that first did you wound
Shall bear record / and ouermore bewreke
On which of you / his troth first break
So that by aspectes of their fair lokis
Without mercy shall fall the vengeance
For to be raced clean out of my bokis
On which of you be found of variance
Therefore attones sets your plesance
Fully to ben while ye have life and mind
Of one acorde unto your lives end
That if the spirit of newfanglenes
In any wyle your hertes would assaylle
To meue or styre to bring in doublenes
Upon your troth to given a bataylle
Let not your courage ne your force faylle
Nor none assaults you flitten or remeue
For unassayed no man may troth preue
For white is whitter if it be set by black
And sweet is swecter after bitterness
And falshed ever is drive and put a back
Where truth is roted with out doblenes
Without preue there may be no sekernes
Of love or hate and therefore of you two
Shall love be more / for hit was bought with woo
And every thing is had more in deynte
And more of pris when it is dear bought
And eke love stondeth more in sewrte
When it is to fore with pain woo and thought
Conquered was first when hit was sought
And every conquest has his excellence
In his pourfute as it fyndeth resistance
And so to you more sote and agreeable
Shall love be found I do you plainly assure
Without grucchyng that ye were suffrable
So low so meke patiently to endure
That al attones I shall do now my cure
For now and ever your hertis so to bind
That naught but death shall the knot unbind
Now in this matter what should I longer dwell
Come ye attones and do as I have said
And first my daughter that are of bounte well
In heart and thought be glad and well a puyd
To done him grace that shall and has obeyed
Your lusts ever / and I will for his sake
Of troth to you be bound and undertake
And so forth within presence as they stand
To fore the gods this fair and well
Her humble servant took goodly by the hond
As he to fore her / mekely did knele
And kyssed him after fulfillyng eueridele
From point to point in full thryfty wise
As ye to forn have venus herd deuyse
Thus is this man to joy and al plesance
From heaviness and from his peynes old
Full reconcyled / and has full suffisance
Of her that ever meant well / and would
That in good faith and I tell should
The inward mirthes did her hertis brace
For all my life to tell / it were to lityl space
For he has won her that he loves best
And she to grace has take him of pity
And thus her hertes ben both set in rest
Without change or mutabilite
And venus has of her benygnyte
Confermed al what shall I longer tarry
These tweyne in one and never to vary
That for the joy in the temple about
Of this acorde by great solempnyte
Was laud and honor within and without
Give to venus / and to the deyte
Of god cupide / so that Caliope
And al her sustren in her armonye
Soon with songs the gods did magnifye
And al attones with notes loud and sharp
They did he honor and her reverence
And Orpheus among them with his harp
Began strings touch with his diligence
And Amphion that has such excellence
Of musyke ay did his besynes
To plese and queme venus the goddess
Only for cause of the affinyte
Betwix these two not lusty to disseuere
And every lover of low and bye degree
Began venus pray fro thens forth and ever
That hool of them the love may persevere
Withouten end in such wise as they gemie
And more encrece that hit of hard was womie
And the gods heryng this request
As she that knew the clean entencion
Of both them tweyne made a bihest
Perpetuelly by confirmacion
Whylis they live of one affection
They shall endure there is no more to said
That neither shall hiue matter to complain
So ferfurth evermore in our eternal see
The gods have in our presence
Fully devised through their deyte
And holy concluded by her Influence
That by their might and Just prudence
The love of hem by grace and eke fortune
With out change shall evermore contune
Of which grant the temple enuicon
Through hye comfort of them that were present
Anon was begun with a melodyous sowun
In name of tho that troth in love meant
A balade new in full good intent
To fore the gods with notis land and clear
Syngyng right this anon as ye shall here
Fairest of sterres that with your psant light
And with the sherysyng of your stremes clear
Causen in love hertes to be light
Only by chynyng of your glad spece
Now lawde and and prece O vemus lady dear
Be to your name that have without sin
This man fortuned his lady for to win

To you we thank lovers that len here
That ye this man and never for to twynne
Fortune have / his lady for to win
And with the noise an heavenly melodye
With that they made in her armonye
Through out the temple for this man's sake
Out of my sleep anon I did awake
And for astonyed knew as tho no read
For sodeyn change oppressed with dread
Me thought I was cast in a trance
So clean a way was tho my remembrance
Of all my dreme / Whereof great thought and woe
I had in heart and nyst what was to do
For heuyntes for that I had lost the sight
Of her that I all the long night
Had dremed of in mine aduision
Whereof I made great lamentacion
Be cause I had never in my life beforn
Saw none so fair since that I was born
For love of whom so as I can endyte
I purpose here to make and to write
A lityl tretyse and process make
In price of women only for her sake
Hem to comende as it is skyl and right
For her godenes with all my might
Prayng to her that is so bounteuous
So full of virtue and so gracycus
Of womanhede and mercyful pity
This simple tretyse for to take in gre
Til I have leyzer unto her hye renoun
For to expound my forsaid visioun
And tell in plain the signefyaunce
As it comes to my remembrance
So that her after my lady may hit look
Now go thy way thou litil rude look
To her presence as I the comande
And first of all thou me recomande
Unto her and to her excellence
And pray to her / hit le non offense
If only word in the be myssaid
Besechyng her / she be not evil a paid
For as her list I will the efte correct
When that her likes againward the direct
I mean that benygne and goodly of face
Now go thy way and put the in her grace
