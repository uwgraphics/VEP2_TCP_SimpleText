TO THE RIGHT Worshipful Master JOHN FITZIAMES Esquire, one of his Majesty's
chief Justices of Peace within the County of DORSET.
SIR, Amongst all the sins, that humane nature does stand possessed with,
ingratitude, does challenge a property in man, although it be a thing
repugnant to reason, and disagreeing with all mutual focietie. To free myself
from this vitium naturae, I am bold in these few lines to dedicate my love to
you: for it were too tedious to use many words, where good will is the bond of
love. This small gift I would entreat you to accept, if not for the quantity,
yet for the quality.

From London the thirteenth of October, 1610. Your Worships to commannd, SIL.

A DISCOVERY OF THE BARMVDAS, OTHER WISE called the I Will of Devils.
I Being in ship called the seaventure, with Sir THOMAS Gates, our Governor,
Sir GEORGE Summers, and Captain Newport, three most worthy honored Gentlemen,
(whose valor and fortitude the world must needs take notice off, and that in
most Honorable designs) bound for Virginia, in the height of thirty degrees
of northerly latitude, or thereabouts: we were taken with a most sharp and
cruel storm upon the five and twentieth day of July, Anno 1609. which did not
only separate us from the residue of our fleet, (which were eight in number)
but with the violent working of the Seas, our ship became so shaken, torn, and
leaked, that she received so much water, as covered two ^ire of hogsheads
above the ballast; that our men stood up to the middles, with buckets,
baricos, and kettles, to bail out the water, and continually pumped for three
days and three nights together, without any intermission; and yet the water
seemed rather to increase, then to diminish: in so much that all our men, being
utterly spent, tired, and disabled for longer labor, were even resolved,
without any hope of their lives, to shut up the hatches, and to have committed
themselves to the mercy of the sea, (which is said to be merciless) or rather
to the mercy of their mighty God and redeemer, (whose mercies exceed all his
works) seeing no help, nor hope, in the apprehension of man's reason, that any
mothers child could escape that inevitable danger, which every man had proposed
and digested to himself, of present sinking. So that some of them having some
good and comfortable waters in the ship, fetched them, and drunk one to the
other, taking their last leave one of the other, until their more joyful and
happy meeting, in a more blessed world; when it pleased God out of his most
gracious and merciful providence, so to direct and guide our ship, (being left
to the mercy of the sea) for her most advantage; that Sir George Summers
(sitting upon the poope of the ship, (where he sat three days and three
nights together, without meals meat, and little or no sleep) couning the
ship to keep her as upright as he could, (for otherwise she must needs
instantly have foundred) most wishedly happily discryed land; whereupon he most
comfortably encouraged the company to follow their pumping, and by no means to
cease bayling out of the water, with their buckets, baricos, and kettles;
whereby they were so over wearied, and their spirits so spent with long
fasting, and continuance of their labor, that for the most part they were
fallen asleep in corners, and wheresoever they chanced first to sit or lie:
but hearing news of land, wherewith they grew to be somewhat revived, being
carried with will and desire beyond their strength, every man busled up, and
gathered his strength and feeble spirits together, to perform as much as their
weak force would permit him: through which weak means, it pleased God to
work so strongly as the water was staide for that little time, (which as we
all much feared, was the last period of our breathing) and the ship kept from
present sinking, when it pleased God to send her within half an English mile,
of that land that Sir George Summers had not long before discryed: Which were
the Islands of the Barmudas. And there neither did our ship sincke, but more
fortunately in so great a misfortune, fell in between two rocks, where she
was fast lodged and locked, for further budging: whereby we gained, not only
sufficient time, with the present help of our boat, and skiffe, safely to
set, and convey our men ashore (which were one hundred and fifty in number) but
afterward had time and leisure to save some good part of our goods and
provision, which the water had not spoiled, with all the tackling of the ship,
and much of the iron about her, which were necessaries not a little available,
for the building and furnishing of a new ship and pinnis, which we made there,
for the transporting and carrying of us to Virginia. But our delivery was not
more strange in falling so opportunely, and happily upon the land, as our
feeding and preservation, was beyond our hopes, and all men's expectations most
admirable. For the Islands of the Barmudas, as every man knows that has heard
or read of them, were never inhabited by any Christian or Heathen people, but
ever esteemed, and reputed, a most prodigious and enchanted place, affoording
nothing but gusts, storms, and foul weather; which made every Nauigator and
Mariner to avoid the^, as Scylla and Charibdis; or as they would shun the
Devil himself; and no man was ever heard, to make for the place, but as
against their wills, they have by storms and dangerousnesse of the rocks, lying
seven leagues into the Sea, suffered shipwreck; yet did we find there the
air so temperate and the Country so abundantly fruitful of all fit
necessaries, for the sustentation and preservation of man's life, that most in a
manner of all our provisions of bread, bear, and victual, being quite
spoiled, in lying long drowned in salt water, notwithstanding we were there for
the space of nine months (few days over or under) not only well refreshed,
comforted, and with good satiety contented, but out of the abundance thereof,
provided us some reasonable quantity and proportion of provision, to carry us
for Virginia, and to maintain our selves, and that company we ^ound there, to
the great relief of them, as it fell out in their so great extremities, and in
respect of the shortness of time, until it pleased God, that by my Lords
coming thither, their store was better supplied. And greater, and better
provisions we might have made, if we had had better means for the storing and
transportation thereof. Wherefore my opinion sincerely of this Island is, that
whereas it has been, and is still accounted, the most dangerous unfortunate,
and most forlorn place of the world, it is in truth the richest,
healthfullest, and pleasing land, (the quantity and bigness thereof
considered) and merely natural, as ever man set foot upon: the particular
profits and benefits whereof, shall be more especially inserted, and hereunto
annexed, which every man to his own private knowledge, that was there, can
avouch and justify for a truth. Upon the eight and twentieth day of July 1609.
(after the extremity of the storm, was something qualified) we fell upon the
shore at the Barmudas; where after our general Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George
Summers, and Captain Newport, had by their provident carfulness landed all
their men, and so much of the goods and provisions out of the ship, as was not
utterly spoiled, every man disposed and applied himself, to search for, and
to seek out such relief and sustentation, as the Country afforded: and Sir
George Summers, a man inured to extremities, (and knowing what thereunto
belonged) was in this service, neither idle nor backward, but presently by his
careful industry, went and found out sufficient, of many kind of fishes, and
so plentiful thereof, that in half an hour, he took so many great fishes
with hooks, as did suffice the whole company one day. And fish is there so
abundant, that if a man step into the water, they will come round about him;
so that men were feign to get out for fear of biting. These fishes are very
fat and sweet, and of that proportion and bigness, that three of them will
conveniently lade two men: those we called rock fish. Besides there are such
abundance of mullets, that with a seane might be taken at one draught one
thousand at the least, and infinite store of pilchards, with diverse kinds of
great fishes, the names of them unknown to me: of crayfishes very great ones,
and so great store as that there has been taken in one night with making
lights, even sufficient to feed the whole company a day. The Country affords
great abundance of Hogs, as that there has been taken by Sir George Summers,
who was the first that hunted for them, to the number of two and thirty at one
time, which he brought to the company in a boat, built by his own hads. There
is Foul in great numvpon the Islands, where they breed, that there has been
taken in two or three hours, a thousand at the least; the bird being of the
bigness of a good Pidgeon, and lays eggs as big as Hen eggs upon the
sand, where they come and lay them daily, although men sit down amongst them;
that there has been taken up in one morning, by Sir Thomas Gates men, one
thousand of eggs: and Sir George Summers men, coming a little distance of
time after them, have stayed there whilst they came and laid their eggs
amongst them, that they brought away as many more with them; with many young
birds very fat and sweet. Another Sea foul there is that lies in little holes
in the ground, like unto a cony-hole, and are in great numbers, exceeding good
meat, very fat and sweet (those we had in the winter) and their eggs are
white, and of that bigness, that they are not to be known from Hen eggs. The
other birds eggs are speckled, and of a different color: there are also great
score and plenty of Herons, and those so familiar and tame, that we beat them
down from the trees with stones and staves; but such were young Herons:
besides many white Herons, without so much as a black or gray feather on them;
with other small birds so tame and gentle, that a man walking in the woods with
a slicke, and whistling to them, they will come and gaze on you, so near that
you may strike and kill many of them with your stick; and with singing and
hollowing you may do the like. There are also great store of Tortoses, (which
some call Turtles) and those so great, that I have seen a bushel of eggs in
one of their bellies, which are sweeter then any Hen egg: and the Tortose it
self, is all very good meat, and yields great store of oil, which is as
sweet as any butter; and one of them will suffice fifty men a meal, at the
least: and of these has been taken great store, with two boats, at the least
forty in one day. The Country yields diverse fruits, as prickled pears, great
abundance, which continue green upon the trees all the year; also great
plenty of Mulberries, white and red: and on the same are great store of
Silke-wormes, which yield cods of silk, both white and yellow, being some
course, and some fine. And there is a tree called a Palmito tree, which has a
very sweet berry, upon which the hogs do most feed; but our men finding the
sweetness of them, did willingly share with the hogs for them, they being very
pleasant and wholesome, which made them careless almost of any bread with their
meat; which occasioned us to carry in a manner all that store of flower and
meal, we did or could save for Virginia. The head of the Palmito tree is very
good meat, either raw or sodden, it yields a head which waigheth about
twenty pound, and is far better meat, then any cabbidge. There are an
infinite number of Cedar trees, (the fairest I think in the world) and those
bring forth a very sweet berry, and wholesome to eat. The Country (for as much
as I could find my self, or hear by others) affords no venomous creature, or
so much as a Rat or Mouse, or any other thing unwholesome. There is great store
of Pearl, and some of them very fair, round, and Oriental; and you shall
find at least one hundred seed of Pearl in one Oyster; there has been
likewise found, some good quantity of Amber Greece, and that of the best sort.
There are also great plenty of Whales, which I conceive are very easy to be
killed, for they come so usually, and ordinarily to the shore, that we heard
them oftentimes in the night a bed; and have seen many of them near the
shore, in the day time. There was borne upon the Barmudas, at the time of our
being there two children, the one a man child, there baptized, by the name of
Barmudas: and a woman child, baptized by the name of Barmuda: as also there was
a marriage between two English people upon that Island. This Island, I mean the
main Island, with all the broken Islands adjacent, are made in the form of a
half Moon, but a little more rounder, and divided into many broken Islands, and
there are many good harbors in it, but we could find one especial place to
go in, or rather to go out from it, which was not altogether free from some
danger, and that lies on the Southeast-side, where there is three fathoms
water, at the entrance thereof, but within six, seven, or eight fathoms at the
least, where you may safely lie land-locked, from the danger of all winds and
weathers, and more to the trees. The coming into it, is so narrow and straight
between the rocks, as that it will with small store of munition be fortified,
and easily defended, with all advantage the place affords, against the forces
of the Potentest King of Europe. There are also plenty of Hawks, and very good
Tobacco, as I think, which through forgetfulness, I had almost omitted: now
having finished and rigged our ship, and pinnis, the one called the
Deliverance, the pinnis the Patience, we prepared and made our selves ready,
to ship for Virginia, having powdered some store of hogs flesh, for provision
thither, and the company thereof, for some reasonable time: but were compelled
to make salt there for the same purpose, for all our salt was spent and
spoiled, before we recovered the shore. We carried with us also a good
portion of Tortose oil, which either for frying or baking did us very great
pleasure, it being very sweet, nourishing, and wholesome: the greatest defects
we found there, was tar and pitch for our ship and pinnis, in steed whereof
we were forced to make lime there of a hard kind of stone, and use it: which
for the present occasion and necessity, with some wax we found cast up by the
Sea, from some ship wrack, served the turn to pay the seames of the pinnis
Sir George Summers built, for which he had neither pitch nor tar: so that
God in the supplying of all our wants, beyond all measure, showed himself
still merciful unto us, that we might accomplish our intended voyage to
Virginia, for which I confidently hope, he does yet reserve a blessing in
store, and to the which I presume, every honest and religious heart will
readily give their Amen. When all things were made ready, and commodiously
fitted, the wind coming fair, we set sail and put off from the Barmudas,
the tenth day of May, in the year 1610. and arrived at James town in
Virginia, the four and twentieth day of the same Month: where we found some
threescore persons living. And being then some three weeks or thereabouts
passed, and not hearing of any supply, it was thought fitting by a general
consent, to use the best means for the preservation of all those people that
were living, being all in number two hundred persons. And so upon the eight of
June one thousand six hundred and ten, we embarked at James Town: not having
above fourteen days victaile, and so were determined to direct our course for
new foundland, there to refresh us, and supply our selves with victaile, to
bring us home; but it pleased God to dispose otherwise of us, and to give us
better means. For being all of us shipped in four pinnices, and departed from
the town, almost down half the River, we met my Lord de la War coming up
with three ships, well furnished with victaile, which revived all the company,
and gave them great content. And after some few days, my Lord understanding of
the great plenty of Hogs and Fish, was at the Barmudas, and the necessity of
them in Virginia, was desirous to send thither, to supply himself with those
things, for the better comforting of his men, and the plantation of the
Country. Whereupon Sir George Summers being a man best acquainted with the
place, and being willing to do service unto his Prince and Country: without
any respect of his own private gain: and being of threescore years of age at
the least, out of his worthy and valiant mind, offered himself to undertake
to perform with Gods help that dangerous voyage for the Barmudas, for the
better relief and comfort of the people in Virginia, and for the better
plantation of it, which offer my Lord de la war, very willingly and
thankfully accepted: and so upon the nineteenth of June, Sir George Summers
embarked himself at James town in a small barge of thirty tonne, or therabout,
that he built at the Barmudas: wherein he labored from morning until night,
as duly as any workman does labor for wages, and built her all with Cedar,
with little or no iron work at all: having in her but one boult, which was in
the k^son: notwithstanding thanks be to God, she brought us in safety to
Virginia, and so I trust he will protect him, and send him well back again,
to his hearts desire, and the great comfort of all the company there.

The Barmudas lies in the height of two and thirty degrees and a half, of
Northerly latitude, Virginia bearing directly from it, West, North west, two
hundred and thirty leagues.
