^^te^ appellatiues and propr^^, is this word of. The da^^ue is that, that
betokens a thing, as to the which is a auau^tage, hurt, plearure, sendyng,

signs in englisshe, for, fro, with, than, and by.

collectiues, in their singular, have strength of the plurel nombre. And like
wise.ij. or mo propres o^ apellatyues, or pronownes primitiues joined with a

thing without any, difference of time, and ever with a certayn^ difference of
person.

Otherwise.
which signifies a thing, as showed rehearsed or had with some difference of

possessiues. A pronowne demonstratiue is that, that shows a thing, as ego,

as ego. And the words of the ^y^st person be en englisshe, I, me, us, and we.

The secunde person signifies a thing as spoken to, as thou. and therefore
every uocatiue case is the secu^de person, as Petre. and the words of the
secu^de person in englisshe be, thou, the, you, and ye.

The third person is that, that betokens a thing as spoken of, and under
this be contained all nownes, pa^ticiples, and pronownes save two primitiues,
ego and tu, and uocatyues, as it is said before.

Gendres.
The masculi^ of pronownes is that, that shows or reports a thing that is
of male kind, or that is wont in laten tongue to be joined with words of the
masculyne gendre. The femynyne shows or reports a thing that is of female
kind, or that is wont in laten tongue to be joined with words of the femyne.
The neutre shows or reports a thing that is another male nor female, nor
wont to be joined with words of the masculyne or femynyne.

to do, or to suffer, with some difference of time, as sum, eram, amo ba^, amor
bar. There is one verb of (...), which is Su^ es sui. Of other verbes, at
that (...) sufficient sentence by them self, without any (...) after them
receyuyng their deed, be called absolutes as sto, iaceo, ambulo. Al other may
be called transitiues. Of the which some be actiues, some passiues, some
^^men, some neutre, some deponentes.

Modes.
Modis be.vi. the indicative, the impatiue, the optatiue, the pote^tial, the
subiu^ctiue, and the infinitive. The indicative signifies a deed as told, as
amo I love, sometime as asked, as amo ego? love I?

The imperatyue betokens a thing as boden or commanded, as ama, love thou.

The optatiue signifies a deed as wysshed, sometime with an aduerbe of
wysshynge, and sometime without, as vtinam amer, god grant I be loved.

signs i^ englisshe be these may, might, would, or should, and it has.v.
tenses in every verb of like voice to the subiu^ctiue mode^ as Amem I may
love, amarem ^ might, would, or should love, amauerim I may (...) I might had
loved, a mauero I shall (...). And this mode also may be taken in a sky (...),
as Amem ne ego inimicum.

The subiuntiue mo^e signifies like the indicative mode, but it co^eth never
without a^ (...) verb before him, set out or v^dersta^de, a^ (...). The
infinitive signifies doing, being, (...) su^^ery^g without nombre and person,

GENERALLY OF CONSTRVCTION.
FOr the due ioynyng of words in construction it is to be understand, that a
verb of certain person and nombre, must ever have a nominatyue case joined
with him, set out or understand. as Ego audio.

Also every adjective, keeping his strength, must have a propre or
appellatiue, or somewhat standing for them, joined with him. as Magnus
Alexander, gratus discipulus, velle tuum.

Also the relative qui must ever have joined with him, other openly or in
understanding, somthyng of the sentence going before, which is called the
antecedent. as Maro legitur^ qui imitatus est Homerum. where, with qui, is
understand Maro.

Also when soever.ij. verbes come together in one sentence, having no
nominative case between expressed nor understand, the latte^ shall be the
infinityue mode. as Cupio discere.

Also a preposition, keeping his own strength, may not stand without a
casual word, in such case as he is co^strued with. as Ad templum ab vrbe.

Of intransi^iue constr^ction. The first intransitiue^
PRaeceptor docet. why is docet the singular nombre, and the third person^ For
the verb of certain nombre and person, must ever agree with his nominatyue
case, (...) Nombre and person. as Ego scribo. Tu legis.

How know thou the nominative longyng^ to the uerbe? By this englisshe who
or what, set before ^he ^erb^, ^or the word that answers it, is the
nominatyue case. As in this reason. I read. The nominative case is I, because
it answers to that question who or what redeth.

The secunde intransitiue.
GRatus discipulus laudat praeceptorem. why is gratus the nominatyue case, the
masculyn ge^dre and the singular no^bre? For the nowne adjective must agree
with his propre or appellatiue in iij. case, gendre, and nombre. As uir bonus,
mulier ^roba.

And all nownes interrogatyues, relatyues of accidence, with their reddytiues.
Also partitiues, co^paratiues, superlatiues, numerals, and pronownes both
demonstratiues and possessyues. Also participles have like co^struction, with
their propre or appellatyue, as nowne adjectives have. as quanta turba. ta^ta
moles. Neutra acies. Melior fortuna. Maximus latro. Tres fratres. Hic uir. Illa
anus. Noster ^erus. Homo armatus.

How know thou the propre or appellatyue longing to the adjective? By this
question who o^ what, set after the adjective. as in this construction. A
swyfte horse. A swyfte what? A swyfte horse.

The third intransitiue.
VIr sapit, qui pauca loquitur. why is qui the nominative case, the masculyn
gendre, and the synguler no^bre? For this relatyue qui, and generally all
nownes and pronownes relatyues, must agree with their propre, or appellatyue,
or pronowne primityue, which they rehearse of the reason going before, in.iij.
case, gendre, and nombre. as vir sapit, qui pauca loquitur. Ego scribo, et ide^
doceo. Est homo studiosus, qualis es tu. where, with qui, is understand uir:
with idem, ego: with qualis, homo.

what is the word here, that the relatyue qui reherseth of the reason going
before? This appellatyue vir. why understand thou this appellatiue vir,
after the relatyue in the nominatyue case? For so my rule byddeth me. Say thy
rule.

If there come no nominatyue case bitwene the relatyue and the verb, than shall
the word, that the relatyue reherseth, be the nomynatyue case to the verb.

If there come any nominatyue case bitwene the relatyue and the verb, than
shall the word, that the relatyue reherseth, be such case, as the verb will
have after him. as Audio fabulam, quam Tere^tius dedit. Orels such case, as
some word, that comes with the verb will have after him, which word is
sometime a nowne appellatyue. As Cuius numen adoro.

Sometime an adiectyue, and that diverse ways. as Cuius inopem fouisti.

Quorum optimum ipse habeo.

Cui similem non uidi.

Quo dignum iudicaui.

Quo maiorem non uidi.

Sometime an infinityue mode, participle, geru^diue, or supyne. As Quem cupio
uidere.

Cui ^elim te obsequentem.

Quem uidendo obstupuit.

(...) salutatum uenit.

^^^tyme a preposicion or an aduerbe. as (...) videor amari.

(...) melius nemo scribit.

^^^her wise. The relatyue qui agrees with his ^^^^cedent in.iij. gendre,
nombre, and person. And (...) case. I^ there come no noi^atyue case bitwene
(...) ^elatyue and his verb, than s^all the relatyue (...) ^he nominatyue case
to the verb.

(...) there come any noi^atiue case bitwene the rela^^^^ and the uerbe, than
the relative must be such, (...) as the uerbe will have after him, orels such
(...) as some word that comes with the uerbe will (...) after him. As the
ensamples before shows.

^^owe know thou the word lo^gyng to the re^^^yue? By this question who or
what, set after the ^^latyue, as in this reason. Virgil prayseth Aeneas,
^^^^che was a Trojan. the word longyng to the re^^^^ue is Aeneas, because it
answers to this que^^^^n who or what, set after the relatyue this wise.
^hiche who or what was a trojan? Aeneas.

Appositiue construction.
PLato est philosophus. why is philosophus the nomynatyue case? For the casual
word, that comes after the verb Sum es fui, verbes passiues, or neuts
absolute, as iudicor incedo, If it have not thenglisshe of some preposicion, as
to or of, before it, it must agree with the word that goes before them in
case. As Virgil was a poet. Vergilius erat poeta. Virgil was called Maro.
Virgilius dicebatur Maro. I go right, Incedo rectus.

But if it be an adiectyue or a word that has the construction of adiectyues,
it must agree in case, ge^dre, and nombre with the word that goes before the
same verbes. As the master is sick. p^ceptor est aeger. And be this called
the appositiue co^struction.

General before transityue construction.
AVdio Terentiu^, quem tu edidicisti. why goes the accusatyue quem, before his
uerbe? For so byddeth my rule. what is that? Generally it is to be known, that
nowne, uerbe, participle, aduerbe, or interiection, that be co^strued with any
oblique case will go before the same oblique. as Domus Pompeij. Clementia
Caesaris. Video herum. prope fontem.

Except it be an interrogatyue, or the relatyue qui que quod, for they must
ever, in such constructio^, go before. as quem queris? vtri faues? Quos tu
perdideras.

Nownes construed with a genytyue.
COdex Virgilij. why is Virgilij the genytyue case after codex? For every nowne
appellatyue, may be construed with a genityue of the word following, that

be commonly construed with the indicative mode of verbes. as Qua^quam animus
horret.

(...) vereo^ ^udices.

And like wise tametsi. as Tametsi iactat.

Quis and licet most commonly with the subiunctiue mode^ as Quis exeat. Licet
miretur.

S^, donec, dum for donec, antequam, postquam, priusquam, be construed both
with the indicative and subiu^ctyue. Vt, for that, coming after a uerbe is
construed with ^he subiunct^ue alonely. Like wise vt for quamuis.

SVPPLEMENTA.
But for the supplyeng of rules of co^struction, hitherto given, it shall be
necessary to know these that follow here.

Apposition.
Plato philosophus praecepit. why is philosophus the nominative case? For
generally al words i^ one (...), that stands both other as the sufferer, or
the doe^, or to whom any thing grows unto, as (...) or hurt, or be both as
named, or both as in^^^ument, or price, or both as measure or time, or both as
place, whether any verb of being or namyng come between them or no, they must
be put in one case, though they vary in gendre and no^bre^. as Homerus fons
poetarum auditur a discipulo puero.

Erat ingratus mihi preceptori.

Petrus vocabatur Cephas.

Percussit fuste grauitelo.

Emi centum aureis magna summa.

Studui viginti annos magnam partem virae.

Habitat in vrbe Roma.

And when there comes no verb between the words so construed, as in the
exmamples now said, be it called the first appositiue. And the other that was
spoken of in the rudimentis, the secunde.

Otherwise thus. The casual word, that in one clause stands as one thing,
with an other casual word, must be put in one case with it, whether any verb
come between them or no. Examples when a verb comes bitwene. as Tu es ciuis,
or haeres, or aeger.

Ego vocor Thomas.

Tu seeds incuruus.

Ille discit inuitus.

Examples, where no verb comes bitwene.

Lilius praeceptor. Taurus mons. Thamesis flumen.

Londinum vrbs.

we shall know when any such word stands as one thing, with the casual
word before, by this question, who or what. for if it answer to that
question, set after the word before, it stands as one thing. Examples,
where a verb comes bitwene, as in these clauses. Thou art a citezin, or thou
art the heir, or thou art sick. These words, a citezi^, the heir, and
sick, stand as one thing with the noi^atyue, that goes before the verb,
for because they answer to this question, who or what, set after the no^atiue
and the verb. Thus. Thou art. what? Thou art a citezin, or the heir, or sick.

^xample, when no verb comes between. as in these clauses.

Lily the master. London the cite. these words master and cite, stand as
one thing with the casual words that goes before, for because they answer
^he qu^stion, who or what, set after the words that go before. as Lily what?
Lily the master.

^ondon what? London the cite.

Of the superlatiue.
The superlatiue degree, if it be construed in tran^^^yuely, that is to say in
one case, with any word ^oyng before, it must agree with the same ingendre and
nombre like an adiectyue, what so ever be the genitive following. as Leo est
fortissimus animaliu^. Rosa est pulcherrima florum.

And i^ there be no such word going before, it must ag^^ in gendre with the
genytiue that follows. as Maxima animalium degunt in aqua.

And the same reason must be observed in partitiues as Vnu^ hominum iudicatus
est ab Apolline sapie^s. (...) solae animalium retro ambulantes pascuntur.

Of a genityue for a dative and contrary wise.
Amicus Caesaris. why is caesaris the genitive case? ^or of the nownes assygned
to the datyue, some by ^easan of possession or longing to, may be co^strued
with a genitive. as Amicus inimicus Virgilij.

Similis or dissimilis maiorum.

As contrary wise. Some of them that be assygned to genitive, may have a dative
of the word that has to before it. as, Praeceptor mihi. Conscius sibi.

Of the comparatyue.
Minor fratrum. why is fratrum the genityue after a nowne comparatiue? For
nownes comparatiues of the word plurell, that has this sign of before it,
will have the genityue, like partitiues. as, The more of the.ij. brethren.

Mayor duorum fratrum.

Peritior nostrum duorum.

Paulo altior patre. why is paulo the ablatyue case, where the comparatyue has
an other ablative patre? For all the comparatyue degrees, beside their
ablatyue, that was spoken of in the rudimentis: may have an other ablative, of
the word that betokens the measure of their excess. as Multo fortior. Paulo
altior.

And this ablative is common to superlatiues also. as, Multo iucundissimus.

And to receive verbes, that betoken preferryng or exceeding. as Multo
praestat. praeualet. superat. or vincit.

Also to.iiij. aduerbes, Secus, aliter, ante, post. as, Multo secus. Multo post.

And the genityue after comparatiues may be resolved into an ablative, with the
preposition e or ex. as, Mayor iuuenum, mayor ex iuuenibus.

Construction of mei, tui, sui, nostri, and vestri: pronownes.
NOn meministi nostri. why say we here rather nostri, than nostrum? For after
all verbes, Gerundyues, or Supynes, that been construed with a genitive. we must
of these.ij. pronownes primi^iues ego and tu, use the genitive in ^. as
Misereo^ (...) or vestri. Indiges mei or nostri. Except.ij. ver b^s, interest
and refert, after the which, for the ge^itiue of these pronownes, we must use
the ablatiu^ lem^^^ne of their possessyues. as Interest o^ refert mea tua sua
nostra et vestra.

And like wise for the genitive sui, we must use sua. as Interest sua.

Men^or nostri. why use we here nostri, and not nostrum? For after all
adjectives, that be construed with a geni^yue, we must use the genitive in i.
as Plenus or similis mei.

^lecius or immemor tui.

Compos or cupidus vestri. Expers nostri.

Except they be numerals, or partitiues, or superlatiues: which, wha^ they
must have the genitive plu^ell of one of these pronownes, we must use the
genitive in um. as Vnus or duo nostrum.

Quisque or vterque vestrum.

Tertius or quartus nostrum.

Maximus or minimus vestrum.

Of sui and suus.
The pronowne sui, is never used, but aft nownes or pronownes of the third
person, other returnyng their own deed to them self. as Cicero loves him
self. Cicero diligit se. And like wise Reminiscitur sui. sauet sibi. loquitur
secum. Orels an other man's deed to them. and como^ly after one of these.iij.
co^iunctions, vt, ne, and, quod. orels the infinitive mode. as, Rogat te, vt
uenias ad se, or venire ad se.

Dicit quod obliuisceris sui, or to obliuisci sui.

And when the deed of the third person passes i^ to a thing, longyng to him,
or possessed of him, we must use the possessiue suus. as Cicero remembers his
clientis. Cicero meminit clientum suorum.

Cicero looked to his own business.

Cicero prospexit rebus suis.

Of the infinitive mode.
CVpio spaciari solus. why is solus here the nominative after the infinitive
mode? For the infinitive mode, that comes after a verb, if hit be the deed of
the person that goes before the verb, it may have such case after him, as
that person stands in. as I covet to ride alone.

Cupio equitare solus.

And if it be the deed of an other person, it must have before him, expressed
or understand, an accusative, to signify the person. as I command the, to
lie alone. Iubco te cubare solum.

And if such an infinitive have a dative before him it is a reason of the
other verb, and not of the infinitive mode. as, Permitto tibi dicere.

Delectat me viuere ruri. what is the noi^atiue to delectat? The i^finitiue
viuere, with that that is joined with him. why so? For these thryde persons
iuuat, decet, delectat, oportet, may have for their nominative an infinitive
mode, with that, that is joined with him, and also an accusative aft them. as
Iuuat me incumbere literis.

Except oportet that has no accusative after him.

Iuuat euasisse hoc malum. why is that, that stands for the noi^atiue set
after the verb? For when so ever the infinitive stands for the noi^atiue
before the verb, it is wont always in spekyng to be put after it. as, Delectat
viuere in patria.

Oportet prospicere in futuru^. Co^tigit ducere vxore^. Miserum est semper
timere mortem.

Verbes like impersonals.
OF verbes absolutes, there be some that be referred other to god, or to some
word of their own signification. and therefore commonly they have but the
third person singular. as, Pluit, for deus pluit, or pluuia fit. And like to
these be tonat, ^^ngit, grandinat, fulminat, gelat, lucescit, vesperascit. etc.

Verbes absolutes.
QVid facis? Scribo. what manner of verb is scribo in this spekyng? A verb
neutre absolute. why? For generally every verb sta^dynge in a reason, as
answeryng to one of these questions, what do I, what do thou, what does he?
may be a verb absolute. as Amo, scribo, loquor, seruio. if they stand, as
answeryng to any of these said questions.

Impersonals with a dative.
NOn vacat mihi ludere. why is mihi the dative case? For these third persons
neutres, Accidit, contingit, euenit, competit, placet, libet, licet, expedit,
liquet, patet, constat, sufficit, uacat, (...), Contingit oppetere, Vacat
scribere, having an infinitive for their nominatyue, may have a datyue ^^tem
them. as, Contingit tibi ducere vxorem.

Sum with a genitive.
HI^ ager est Pauli. why is Pauli the genitive? For this verb, Sumes fui, is
construed transitiuely with a genitive, of the word that follows him, and
that has this syllable is or es, joined to it in the end. as, This is Georgis
book. Hic codex est Georgij. Also with a dative, as when it is expounned by
habeo. as, Est mihi nouerca. for he^o ^ouercam.

Verbes with an ablative.
PAlleo timore. why is timore the ablative case? For the word standing as
cause, for whom or by whom, after all manner of verbes, may be put in the
ablative, without a preposition, orels in the accusative with ob or propter. as
Caleo igni et propter igne^. Palleo et frigeo timore. Tremo frigore. Mendico
egestate.

Non largior penuria. Non maneo or abeo pudore.

Of adjectives of price.
PLuris vendidi quam emi. why is pluris the genitive? For of adjectives there
ben.viij. which, if they stand as price, and have none appellatiue with them:
must be put in the genitive. and they be these, tanti, quant^, pluris, minoris,
quantiuis, qua^tilibet, quanticunque, and tantidem. as, Quanti emisti. Pluris
constitit. But if they have any appellatiue with them, they must be put in the
ablative. as, Quanto precio metiris. Tanta summa emi.

Except tantidem, the which has no ablative.

Propre names of towns.
PRofectus est^ Eboracum. why is Eboracum the accusative case? For when so ever
after any verb comes the propre name of any town in the sinification to a
place, or answering to this question, whyther, it shall commonly be put in the
accusatyue case, without a preposition. as, Eo Romam.

And rus and domus be like wise used. as Eo domum. Eo rus.

Veni Roma. why is Roma the ablatyue case? For when the propre name of a town
comethe after a verb, that has the signification as fro a place, or answers
to this question, fro whens, it shall be put in the ablative without a
preposition. as Veni Roma, Tarento.

Also we say, Veni rure, domo.

Like wise if they signify by a place. as Transiui Roma, Tarentino, rure, domo.

Seuerus imperator mortuus Eboraci. why is Ebo raci the genitive case? For when
the prope name of a town comes after a verb, that has the signification at
a place, or answers to this qstion where, (...) be the first declination or
the secunde, and the ^^nguler nombre, it shall be put in the genitive case. as
Fui Rome, Tarenti, with these.v. nownes domi, liumi, militie, belli, foci. If
the towns name be the plurel nombre, or any other declination, it must be put
in the ablative. as Fui Athenis, Sulmone, Neapoli.

And one nowne in the datyue, Ruri.

Personals sometime impersonals.
POenitet me vidisse. why is me thaccusatiue case? For these.vi. verbes,
penitet, tedet, miseret, miserescit, piget, and pudet, when they stand as
p^onals, and have an infinitive before them for their no^atiue case, than they
may have an accusative aft them. as Poenitet me videre hec mala. But often time
they lack an infinitine or an other thing for a nominative. and than they be
called impersonals, and be ^oustrued with a genitive and an accusative also of
diverse things. as, Poenitet me erroris.

There be many special constructions of verbes be (...) these called ideomata,
the which shall be showed (...).

O^ chau^gyng geru^diues of verbes actiues into pa^ticiples passyues.
THe participle in dus has sometime the signifi^^tion of the present. as
ama^dus being loved. But the use of it is most in obliques. And some^^me (...)
has the signification of the future. as Amandus to be loved.

But here is to be known that geru^diues having an accusative case aft them
may be said by the par^^^^ple in dus, if the englisshe be turned passiuely.
(...) ^he accusatyue joined with the said participle (...) ^he case as the
gerundiue was.

(...) that sometime by the present signification of the participle on this
wise. By the geru^diue in di. I was let to day by the besynes of writing
letters. Impediebar hodie occupatione scribendi lras. And by present
signification of the participle in dus. I was let to day by besines of letters
being written.

Impediebar hodie occupatione lrarum. scribe^daru^

And by the geru^diue in do. Lernyng these p^ceptis thou may profit.
Disce^do haec precepta proficias. By the present signification of the
participle. as These preceptis being learned thou may profit. Discendis his
praeceptis proficias.

And by the gerundiue in dum. In gyuyng of thanks this chanced me. Inter
agendum gras hoc mihi contigit. And by the p^sent signification of the
participle. In time of thanks being given, this chau^sed me. Inter agendas
gratias hoc mihi contigit.

Again by the future signification of the participle, thus.
By the gerundiue in di^. we shall have liberte to morrow to eat flesh. Erit
nobis cras libertas comedendi carne^. And by the future signification of the
participle. we shall have liberte to morrow of flesh to be eaten. Erit nobis
cras libertas comede^dae carnis.

By the geru^diue in do. I shall have besines to morrow in redyng poets. Cras
erit mihi negocium in enarrando poetas.

And by the futur signification of the participle, thus. I shall have besines
to morrow in poetis to be red.

Cras erit mihi negotium in poetis enarrandis.

By the geru^diue in du^. we shall go to morrow to gether nuttis. Ibimus cras ad
colligendum nuces.

And by the futur signification of the participle.

we shall go to morrow for nuttis to be gethred.

Ibimus cras ad nuces colligendas.

Construction of certain prepositions. Vsque.
Some prepositions have special co^stuctio^, as vsque: which has with him some
other p^position. as Vsque in pamphiliam. Vsque ad Taurum. Vsque ad festum.

Except propre names of towns, and rus and domus, with the which it is joined
commonly alone. as Romam vsque. Neapolim vsque.

Tenus versus.
These.ij. tenus and versus, against the nature of prepositions, come after the
words that they be co^strued with. as, Romam versus. Pube tenus. And cu^
sometime is likewise set. as, Qui cum. quibus cum. mecu^. tecum. secum.
nobiscum. vobiscu^. And versus with words, that be not propre of towns, is
often time joined with ad or in. as, Ad occide^tem versus. In Italia^ versus.
And often time without. as, Italia^ versus nauigaturus era^. Amanu^ versus
profecti sumus. And tenus is often times co^strued with the genitive, but ever
in plurel no^bre. as, Aurium tenus. Crurium tenus. And with the ablative both
singular and plurell. as, Pube tenus. Pectoribus tenus. Verbis tenus.

Construction of certain interiections.
HEu mihi. why is mihi the datyue case? for these interiections, hei and veh,
be construed with a dative. as, Hei mihi. veh tibi.

And heu with an accusative. as, Heu stirpe^ inuisa^. Sometime both heu and hei
with an nominative. as Heu pietas. hei misera.

Proh is construed with a nominative and an accusative. as, Proh Iuppiter. proh
dolor.

Proh deum atque hominum fidem.

O may be co^strued with a noi^atiue case. as, O for^ati, quoru^ iam menia
surgu^t. O ego ne possem. with an accus. as, O fortunatos. And with a vocative,
but than it is an aduerbe of spekyng to. as, O Melibee.

Of copulatyues ioynyng diverse cases.
^mi equum centum denarijs et pluris. why has (...) the conjunction capulatiue
here like cases? For sometime the proprete of words let copulatiues and
disiunctiues to couple case. as, Emi equum centum nummis et pluris. Fui Rome et
Thebis.

FIgures o^ constructions be Eclypsis, zeugma syllepsis, prolepsis, and
Enallage.
Eclypsis.
when no word lacks in a reason, to perfect co^struction of words, than the
reason may be called hole and just.

when any word lacks due to construction, if it for more shortness be left
out by the common custom of spekyng of authors because it may be understand
of other words in the reason: than the reason may be called figurate and the
figure is called eclypsis. as Lego Virgilium. where to the perfitnes of
construction must needs be understand ego.

There be customably understand in laten tongue, words of al parts. Nownes,
as after the relatyue q, and pronownes relatiues, that is rehearsed of the
reason before, and in the same case gendre nombre, and person, that the article
or the relative is in. as Virgilius recitat, que^ cupio videre. where after
que^ is understand Virgilium. And, Audio Virgiliu^, qui long prestat caeteris
poe^is. where after qui, is understand Virgilius.

And in this manner the figurate is commonly used: the hole but seldom: except a
special cause.

Also after this interrogatyue quis, in the masculine gendre, often times is
understand other homo or deus, after as the sentence requires. as, Quia
currit? for quis homo currit. Quis mu^dum creanit? for quis deus.

Also before such verbes, pl^it, tonat, lucesci^, i^ understand other de^s,
as pluit, for de^s pluit, or el^ some word of their signification. as pl^^ia
t^nitru (...).

Also there be customably understand pronownes as before al verbes of the
first and secu^de person: these noi^natiues, Ego, tu, nos, and vos. as scribo.
where is understand ego. Scribimus. where is understand nos. And in this
manner, the figurate is more used tha^ the hole: except for sum certain
specialte. sometime ille, or some of like signification. as, Didimus est
medicus, et tamen scribit pueris, for tamen ille, or idem, or is scribit pueris.

And verbes often times be understand, specially the verb Sum, almost in all
modes, tenses, no^bres, and persons: except the imperative. as Omnia uanitas.
where is understand sunt. Quis omnia vanitas. where is vndestande sint. Hinc
mihi prima mali labes. where is understand erat. Promisi me vltorem. where is
understand futurum esse or fore.

Also i^ answeryng to questions. if we answer not by an expressed verb, there
must needs be understand the verb that is in the question. as to this
question. Quis scripsit haec? if he be answered Thomas: there must be answered,
scripsit. But if the verb in the interrogatiue or axyng be the first person,
it must i^ answeryng be understand in the secu^de person. as Quot versus
scripsi? If it be answered by an other, december. there must needs be understand,
scripsisti. And if the verb in axyng be the secunde person, it must be
understand in the first: as in this question. Quot annos natus es? If it
answered, dece^, there must be understand, natus sum.

Quem vocas? Nicolaum. why is Nicolaum the ^accusatiue case? For ever the
casual words in the answeryng must be put i^ like case to them that they
answers to, in the axyng. as, Que^ recitas? Virgiliu^. Except the verb be
diversely co^strued with the words, in the axynge, and in the answeryng. as

Emisti ne tanti? Imo vilius vel duplo.

Damnatus ne es furti^ an sacrilegij? Imo utroque.

Cuius est hic liber? Meus, and not mei.

Also before verbes of the subiunctiue mode be often times is understand, this
imperative fac with the co^iu^ction vt: as mittas, for fac mittas, or fac vt
mittas. And sometime the co^iu^ction only. as Velim mittas. Careat successibus
opto: for vt mittas, vt careat.

Also participles be understand: as where.ij. nownes or a pronowne and a nowne
be put i^ the ablatyue of consequence, without any other participle must needs
be understand this participle, ens: though it be out of use. as^ Cesare et
^ibulo co^sulibus, for entibus co^sulibus. And i^ this manner the figurate is
only i^ use.

Also p^positions seruyng to the ablative often time be understand these, a,
cum, e or ex, pro, and in. as Alcibiades intestino malo patria liberata, for ab
intestino malo. and Duo iuuenes candidis equis apparuerunt, for cu^ candidis
equis. And, Procijce tela manu sanguis meus, for e manu. And, Multum et ille et
terris ^actatus et alto, for in terris in alto.

Zeugma.
Sometime.ij. or mo like se^te^ces be closed togeder with one verb, adjective
or participle singular: which is understand in every clause, and set out but
in one, and agrees with some word of the same clause. as Cicero scribit, et
Homerus, et Virgilius.

Catullus erat doctus et Horatius.

And this manner of speaking is figurate, and the figure is called zeugma.

Syllepsis.
Sometime diverse clauses, that is to say, having words of diverse ge^dre,
no^bre, and person, be closed with one verb: adjective or participle: the
which if it be singular must ever agree with the next propre or appellatiue, or
noi^atiue case. as, Tu quos ad studiu^, atque vsum formabis agrestem.

Vtinam, aut hic surdus, aut haec muta facta sit.

Hic illius arma hic currus fuit.

But if the adjective or participle be plurell, it mu^^e agree in gendre and
person, with the most worthy o^ the words, in diverse clauses.

And of gendres the masculyn is more worthy tha^ ^he ^emynine. And of persons,
the first is more worthy than the secu^de or the third, and the secunde ^s
more worthy than the third.

Example of gendres.
Pater et matter mortui sunt.

Examples of persons.
Ego et tu discimus. Tu et ille discitis.

And like wise in one clause, in the secu^de apposi^iue co^struction, if the
noi^atiues be of diverse persons. the verb must agree with the more worthy. as,
Ego Thomas scribo. And this manner of speaking is figu^ate, and the figure is
called syllepsis.

Also many other ways in.ij. clauses, words of the one be wont to be left
out, the which not with ^^andyng to the supplyeng of perfect co^structio^,
must ^edes be repeted of the other. as, multi mortales pe^te perie^e. Plures
ferro cecidere, for plures mortales. Sol auget ventos et comprimit, for
co^primit ve^^^s, Est doctior quam ego, for quam ego sum. Scribit melius quam
ante, for quam ante scribebat or scripsit. But specially (...) a wo^de is
understand, when clauses be joined (...) that answer to gedre. as tantus
quan^^^ N^ modo sed etia^. Tam. qua^. Ita sic. Adeo vt: with (...) other.
Examples. Tantu^ reposui quantum tu, (...) tu reposu isti. Non modo nobis
inuidet, sed etiam ^^bi, for tibi inuidet. Sic viuit vt ego, for ego viuo. Tam
est lactis abundans quam pecoris, for pecoris a^undans.

And in all these supplyenges, when the word that (...) ^^dersta^de is one in all accidents with the word that is set out in the reason. the figure is
called zeugma. And if it be diverse gendre, nombre, and person, mode or tense.
It is syllepsis.

Prolepsis.
when the word plurell that goth before in generalte must needs be understand
in the parties that follow, the figure is called prolepsis. as, Aquile volant,
altera ab orient, altera ab occidente. where must needs be understand twyse
aquila, to fulfill construction. Nos scribimus, tu versus, ego prosam. where is
understand, scribis and scribo. Duoru^^fratrum, alter indoctus, alter doctus.
where is twyse understand frater.

Enallage.
Authors also put sometime one part of speech for an other. and tha^ the
speech is figurate: and the figure is called enallage. as a nowne for an
aduerbe. as, Sole recens orto. And sublime volat, for recenter and sublimiter.

And a pronowne for a nowne. as, Non ea vis animo, for tanta or talis. And,
Quae tua humanitas est? for qualis.

A verb for a nowne. as, Scire tuum nihil est, for scientia.

A participle for a nowne.iiij. ways, when they be used for appellatiues. as,
Cupiens litiu^. Fugiens laborem. when they receive comparation: as doctu^
doctior. when they take comparison other wise tha^ their verb receives. as,
Doceo indoctus.

A preposition for an aduerbe: as post for postea: and ante for antea.

An aduerbe for a nowne. as, Sic vita erat, for talis. Genus vnde latinu^, for
a quo. Hinc ille lachryme for ex hoc. And for a co^iunctio^: as cum, when tame^
follows. as, Cum preuideris, tamen non cauisti.

A conjunction for an aduerbe. as quide^ for pro^ecto or certe. And sometime one
kind, that is under one part for an other kind of the same part, as an
appellatiue for an adiectyue. as, Dardana suscitat arma, for Dardania.

And one pronowne for an other. as, Viuite felice^ quibus est fortuna peracta
Iam sua, for vestra.

And an absolute for an active. as

Ardebat Alexim, for amabat.

And an active for an absolute, or a passyue. as

Sistunt amnes terraeque dehiscu^t: for stant or sistuntur.

And often the p^ters of verbes neutres absolutes, that be taken of doing of
place supply a signification passyue. as, Iuit: he is gone. Venit: he is come.
Sur^exi^: he is risen.

A perticiple passive for an active. as tacitus for tace^s.

One preposition for an other. as

Multa super Priamo, for de Priamo.

Aduerbes of place for aduerdes of time. as

Hic and ibi for tunc.

A conjunction copulative for a disjunctive. as

Subiectisque vrere flammis, for subiectisve.

And sometime one accident for an other. as case for case. as, Proijce tela manu
sanguis meus, for mi. It celo clamor, for ad caelum.

One ge^dre for an other. as validi silices: for ualidae.

One nombre for an oaths. as, Medioque ex host recepti. for medijs ex
hostibus. and pars volucres factae.

One person for an other. as, Omnes aquae quae super celos sunt, for estis.

One mode for an other. as, Facile omnes perferre ac pati, for perferebat, and
patiebatur.

One tense for an other. as, Accedo ad pedissequas, que sit rogo. for accedeba^
and rogaba^, or accessi and ^ogaui. and, Samia mihi matter fuit, for erat.
