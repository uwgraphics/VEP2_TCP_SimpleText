FINIS.
To the right honorable the Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of Leycester, Baron of
Denbigh, master of the Queens Majesty's horse, Knight of the noble order of
the Garter* chief Chaunceler of the University of Oxford, and one of her
highness most honorable privy Counsel: Timothe Kendall wishes happy health
with increase of honor.
THe honor of your person (Right honorable) does not so much daunt me
with astonishment, as the marvelous mildness of your courteous nature does
minister encouragement to presume and perform the dedication of this my
little labor to your honors happy hands. Wherein are to be seen the
sundry devises of diverse the best vvriters, as well antique as neoterique, of
Epigrammes: a proper kind of study doubtless, and as with pleasure, so
with profit in plentiful manner accompanied. Who knovveth not that your
honor is a special Patron of learning and learned men? accepting most
courteously their simple Poesies, whose Garden plots are not so gaily
garnished either with such plenty or such variety as others be, that have
more skill both to make choice of those flovvers that have the sweeter and
more fragra^t smell, as also to pick out such as for their fairenes and comely
change of color breed special love and liking in the eyes of the beholder.
This being unto me an assured and also a sufficient encouragement, I felt in
my self the souden motions of mistrustfulnesse somevvhat appauled, and the
fire of confidence and hope kindlyng in me, in so much that shaking off all
manner cogitations of fond fear and bashfulnesse, I yealded my will and my
work wholy to bring that to accomplishme^t which I had purposed upon a
special opinion of your honors worthiness conceived: trustyng that this my
Manuell shall obtain as good place in the dedication, and as much grace in
the acceptance (according to the measure of the matter) as the volumes of
such as have discovered their skill in things of greater importance. Which
in hope it shall be as I vvish, I cease any longer to molest your Lordshippe
with my unpolished Epistle: beseeching the almighty and the most highest to
bless you with health, long life, increase of honor, and all flourishyng
felicity.

Your honors most humble always to command, Timothe Kendall.

To the courteous and friendly Reader.
Quo semel est imbuta recens seruabit odorem testa diu.
THE Verse of Horace the Poet (right courteous reader) which I my self, by my
self, have proved true: for having enured my self in my green and growyng
years, to readyng of Poetry (an art in my mind and censure both princely and
pleasant) in riper years I could neither by fair means be allured, nor
foul mines procured, from embracyng thereof, so greatly therewith was I linked
in love. Well might I bear and forbear, refrain and abstain for a season,
but by and by in the turnyng of an hand, with the tracyng ape should I break
the dance, and fall a scamblyng for Nuts. Naturam expellas furca licet vsque
recurrit. And surely far discrepant always have I been from the opinion of
those that deem Poetry to bring naught else, but only a certain naked and
vain delectation to the life of man: which unworthy and false accusation is
well and wisely confuted of Strabo inueighyng against Eratosthenes, who seemed
to apply himself to be a maintainer and defender of that false and impudent
sclaunder: wherefore of me thereof needs no refutation. Now (courteous
reader) if I should take in hand to pen and paynt forth the praise of Poetry,
and Poets inventions, I fear me too long my labor would last: only thus
much I dare boldly affirm, that no where shall thou find profit and
pleasure better linked together, than in the worthy works of prudent Poets.
For Flaccus says. Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit vtile dulci.
The price and the praise he gains alone,
Who profit and pleasure both knitteth in one.
Wherefore sundry the most learned of all ages, of all lands and languages,
have bestowed no small labor in the most laudable practice of Poetry. For
example: among the Italians, Bembus, Pontanus, Flaminius: Among the French
men, Borbonius, Salmonius, Muretus: Among the Germans, Eoba^nus, Stigilius,
Sabinus: Among the Scots, Bucchananus: whom Carolus Vtenhouius prettily
praises in his distichon, writing thus (in I Sanna. H Francast. A Flam. H Vid.
A Nauger. P Bemb. Italos: Mich Hosp. Adr Torneb. Io Aurat. Gallos: and Georg.
Buchan. Scotum.) Tres Italos Galli senos vicere, sed vnum
Vincere Scotigenam non valuere nouem.
Three Frenchmen did Italians six
for learning great excel:
But from them all one Scot alone
does hear away the bell.
Now (courteous reader) of all sorts of Poems, and Poesies, none (me thinks)
are more pithie and pleasant, than pretty, short, witty, quick and quippyng
Epigrammes: in the which kind of writing Marcus Valerius Martialis is counted
chiefly to excel. Wherefore out of him (as sundry other most singular authors)
have I translated and taken sundry short, propper, pithie and pleasant verses,
and Epigrammes, for thy no little profit, and great delectation: marry this I
must let thee understand, that as well out of Martial as the rest, I have left
the lewd, I have chosen the chaste: I have weeded away all wanton and
woorthlesse words: I have pared away all pernicious patches: I have chipt and
chopped of all beastly boughs and branches, all filthy and fulsom phrases: Which
I think none will mutter at and mislike, but such as delight more to draw of
the dregs, than drink of the delicate liquour. I do give them unto thee by the
name of Flowers of Epigra^mes, out of sundry the most singular authors
selected. For the which, if thou shall think well of me, and thank me, I
shall (God willing) shortly as convenient leisure shall serve, either augment
these, or publish more for thy delight and profit. In the mean time take
these in good part (I beseech thee) which were made of me.

Cum mihi vernarent dubia lanugine malae.
VALE.
VV. Seymour gentleman of Grayes Inn: in commendation of the author.
WE seldom see, but that a bare respect
That takes regard, but to apply his thought:
As many times, may work to good effect
As deeper driftes, with more disorder wrought:
For in attempts, where proof is to ensew,
It never skills so greatly, to invent,
Or by device, to frame a fetch anew,
As with regard, to order our intent.
For proof we see the practice and devise,
Of such as have the cure of health in hand,
By traynes of sweet, who often the taste entise
To brook the sower, wherein the help does stand.
Wherein, as well, in manner of the cure,
As in the means, the skill is truly tryde:
For that unless the sweetness should allure,
How should the sour, make profit vnapplide?
This is the cause, that moves me to commend
And praise the pains, that well I see were meant:
And as I like the labor of my friend,
So I allow the drift of his intent.
Who seeing sorts of sundry minds to call,
And having will, to work in all aright:
No fitter means, he wist to win them all,
Than thus to train, to profit, by delight.
George VVhetstones gentleman in the authors commendation.
RAre is the work, that likes every mind,
when sundry minds, on sundry judgments feed:
In flowers fools (like Spyders) poison find:
The wise (as Bees) win honey from a weed.
Even so of books (in print that clothed are)
The most of them, most sorts of men peruse,
And of such sorts, some sorts of them prepare
With skillesse scoffs, the writers to abuse:
No force for that: the foe himself does hit
That checkes a work, which he can not amend:
Then sure my friend (this needful book that writ)
Small needs to fear the frumps that fools do lend.
For why? his pains, yeeldes fruits of such emprise,
As him commendes, and does content the wise.
Formoe nulla fides.
E. G. TO THE READER.
LIke as the spring by natures course does breed
The sundry sorts of flowers of pleasant hew:
And clothes the earth with herbs that thence proceed,
Sweet for their sent, and pleasant to the view:
Whereon the mind of man is fixed fast,
Revived now, duld by the winter past:
So in this spring, that earthly things does chere,
Kendall sends forth the flowers that he has got,
Of Epigrammes, by pluckyng here and there
Of learned men, from many a Garden plot.
Smell of his flowers, resort unto this field,
The Gardens be of price that these do yield.
Abraham Fleminge upon T. K. his translated Epigrammes.
A Work with skill beegonne
Deserves to be commended:
But double praise (no doubt) is won
When skill the same has ended.
Such skill in many skante
Does prove them most unskillful:
Self-will they wed, whiles wit they want,
Like fondlynges vain and wilful:
But as their skill deserves
Mere folly to be named:
So where from wit will never swerues,
There skill her forte has framed.
And such a one is he
(His travel gives trial:)
Whose skill amidst so many mistes
Has planted an espiall.
Whose skill has scattered quite
The clouds of Poets pen,
And has by glisteryng leames of light,
To blind and eylesse men
Their covert skill laid out
in letters darckly shown,
And paird away the barckes of dout,
And knotts of knacks unknown.
This labor has lain dead
(No meruell) many years:
But now reuiu'de, and to be read
In English, as appears,
From foreign phrase of speech
Far fette, and also sought,
By one in years (I grant) but young,
Whose wit the same has wrought:
But yet with judgment fraught
and skill on doubts to skan.
Now let me tell what I have thought.
The work commends the man.
Labori ancillatur laus.
A. VV. gent. to the courteous reader, in commendation of these flowers.
Fresh flowers, Cyuet, musk, and ambergreece,
Excel in smell, each one in his degree:
Yet of them all if thou should take a fleece,
As authors flowers so sweet all would not be.
Those all delight the nose with sugared smell,
These all delight the mind with learning well.
The sent of those, does perish soon and vade,
Of flowers, cyuet, musk, and Ambergreece:
But flowers which Kendalls cunnyng here has made
Still flourishe shall: of work a princely piece
His youth has framd: now reader lend him praise
Which spent for thy delight his tender days.
Oublier ne doy.

FLOWERS OF EPIGRAMS: out of sundry the most singular authors selected.
Out of PVLIX an ancient Poet. Hermaphroditus speaks.
WHile great with me my mother went,
uncertain what I was:
She askte the gods what she should have,
a lad, or else a less.
Quoth Mars, thart with a maiden sped:
Not so Apollo said,
It is a man: quoth Juno then,
it is neither man nor maied.
My mothers time of travail came,
her throws and thrutches past:
A mungrill Herkinalson, she
did bring me forth at last.
And askyng the forenamed three,
what should my destenie be:
To dye by dint of deadly swoorde,
affirmed Juno she:
He will be hanged on a tree,
quoth Mars as I suppose:
And I do think said Phoebus then,
in lake, life he shall lose.
Their verdicts none were vain, it came
as each did say to pass:
And how behold: (it is strange I tell,)
a certain brook there was,
Oreshadowed with a tree, that had
full many a leauie branche:
In climyng up this tree, my sword
fell out, and goard my paunche.
The bows in falling, caught my feet,
my head felt in the foorde:
So man, maied, neither both, was I
hangde, drounde, and kilde with sword.
EPIGRAMMES OVT OF MARTIAL.
TIMOTHE KENDAL to the Reader.
MArtial is much mislikt, and lothde,
of modest minded men:
For leude lascivious wanton woorks,
and words which he does pen.
In deed, fond filthy speeches foul,
fair manners much defile:
Wherefore the learned do but well,
to count his verses vile.
Yet though his verses some be vile,
yet some do much avail:
And though his matters some be fond,
yet some of folly fail.
His woorks are like a garden good,
with weeds much ouergrowen:
Lo reader here the fragrant flowers,
the weeds* away are thrown.
The best bereft, the beastly left:
lo reader here to thee,
The dainty Marrowe offered is:
let this thy breakefast be.
Accept this simple Maribone,
for breakefast I thee pray:
So may thou better cheer obtain,
of me an other day.
Of a Lion, that offended his keeper.
A Trustlesse beast, a Lion fearce,
with churlishe chappes did bite
And hurt his master, which him kept,
because he did him smite.
But plaugde he was as he deserude,
for that his cruel part,
For since he strookes refusde with hand,
struck dead he was with darte:
Now how should men which reason have,
and rulers disobaie,
Be punishte, when we brutishe beasts,
for disobedience slaie.
Of a Tiger and a Lion.
A Tiger of the Hyrcan flock,
so tame, that he would stand
Between his masters legs, and eke
most loving lick his hand.
Thus tame I say, yet did he flaie,
a Lion huge and sore:
A thing so strange as never erst,
was hard the like before.
No such thing durst he enterprise,
in woods when wild was he:
Now brought with us to live, his mood
more ragyng fearce ye see.
Of Leander.
WHat time Leander lusty ladde,
his Lady went to see:
When as with waltryng waves out worn,
and wearied quight was he:
He said: Now spite me not (ye seas,)
Leander spare to spill?
When I have seen my Lady once,
then droune me if you will.
Of Gemellus, and Maronilla.
GEmellus, Maronilla feign,
would have unto his wife:
He longs, he likes, he loves, he craves,
with her to lead his life.
What? is she of such beauty brave?
naie none more foul may be:
What then is in her to be likte
or lovd? still cougheth she.
Of Arria, and Paetus.
Chaste Arria when she gave the blade,
unto her Paeto true:
All painted and begoard with blood,
which from her side she drue.
Trust me (said she) my goared gutts,
do put me to no pain:
But that which thou my P must do,
that greues and greues again.
To Fabulla, vainglorious.
OF beauty brave we know thou art,
and eke a maid beside:
Aboundyng eke in wealth and store,
this ne may be denied.
But while to much you praise your self,
and boste you all surmount:
Ne rich, ne fair, Fubulla, nor
a maid we can you count.
To Caecilianus for the gender, and declination of Ficus.
CAecilian when I Ficus said,
thou did me floute therefore:
And badst me rather Ficos say,
and Ficus use no more.
We call that Ficus which on trees,
we dately see to spryng:
And thy deseases Ficos name,
for likeness of the thing.
To Fidentinus.
THou deemst thou art a Poet fine,
And would be thought so Fidentine,
By books, and Epigrams of mine.
So Aegle of her self is thought,
To be well toothed, though stark naught,
Having of horn and bone teeth bought.
So to herself Lycoris she,
Does seem of beauty brave to be,
Because her cheeks men painted see.
So thus as you a Poet are:
You may be busht, when you are bare.
To Laelius.
WHen Laelius thou thy self do naught,
thou carpest Verses mine:
Leave Laelius either mine to carpe,
Or publishe some of thine.
To Neuolus, a Lawier.
WHen every man does speak, then still
thou speak Neuolus:
And think thou passing well do plead,
when thou do prattle thus.
The veriest pelter pilde may seem,
to have experience thus:
Behold now all are silent hushed,
now speak thou Neuolus.
To Flaccus.
FLaccus, Diodor goes to law,
and has for gout no rest:
He gives his lawier naught I think,
his fingers are oppreste.
Of Sceuola.
IF millions many gods would give,
of goodly glitteryng gold:
Should not then Sceuola be esteem^,
and highly be extolde?
Oh then how would I live (quoth he)
whereat the Gods did smile:
And gave him his request: but then
his joys he began exile.
Then ragged goune like peltyng patche,
our Sceuola could use:
With patche on patche like loutishe lob,
he cobled often his shues.
His table then he did neglect,
and course fare pleased him best:
With worldly cares he was so toste,
that scarce he took his rest.
Then must I live he often said,
or else the Gods me take:
And so with wealth began cares increase,
and him more careful make.
To Aelia.
AS I remember Aelia,
four teeth thou had of thine:
One cough did cause thee spit out two,
one, two an other time.
With saftie now still m^iest thou cough,
hawk, hem, spue, spit and spaule:
For now to loose or cough away,
remains naught at all.
To Fidentinus.
It Is told and bruted all abroad,
mine old friend Fidentine:
That thou reportest all abroad,
my books for to be thine.
If thou will grant them mine to be,
I Will gratis send them thee:
But if thou call them thine, buy them,
that mine they may not be.
To Sabidius.
I Love thee not Sabidius,
I can not tell thee why:
I can say naught but this alone,
I do not love thee, I.
Of Cellia.
FOr fire deceast thou do not weep,
if Gellia sole thou be:
But look when comes company,
the tears then gush from thee.
She naught lamenteth Gellia;
that seeks for laud and praise:
But she who sorroweth inwardly,
it is she that wepes always.
To Fidentinus.
THe book which thou do read* it is
friend Fidentinus mine:
But when thou ill do read it, then
beginns it to be thine.
Of Diaulus, a Physician.
DIaulus a Physician late,
but now he buries men:
Look what so now Diaulus does,
the self same did he then.
Against Olus,
THy beard is white, thy bushe is black,
how comes it shall I tell?
With colors thou may paint thy head,
thy beard thou can not well.
To Flaccus.
FLaccus thou know not Epigrams,
no more then babes or boys:
Which deemst them to be nothing else,
but sports and triflyng toys:
He rather toys, and sports it out,
which does in Verse recite
Fell Tereus dinner, or which does,
Thyestes supper write:
Or he which tells how Dedalus,
did teach his son to fly:
Which tells eke of Polyphem,
the Shepherd with one eye.
From books of mine, are quight exempt,
all rancour, rage and gall:
No plaier in his peuishe weeds,
hear prankyng see you shall:
Yet these men do adore (thou say)
laud, like and love: in deed,
I grant you sir those they do laud,
perdie but these they reed.
Against Caecilianus.
WHen not six thousand pound,
Caecilian did enjoy:
Alofte he hoisted was,
in Chariot like a Roye.
When that through Fortunes grace,
he doubled had his stoore:
Behold he went on foot,
even like a peisaut poor.
The game and gain thou haste,
and yet to loose do feign?
Tell truth, lest Fortune froune,
and make thee fall again.
Against Gargilianus.
WIlt have me call thee bountiful,
when gifts thou do bestow
On widows old, and senior chuffs,
that do in substance flow*
Nothing may more dishonest be^,
then these thy subtle shifts:
How can thou call Gargilian,
these guiles of thine thy gifts?
So by the hook the flotyng fish,
is brought unto his have:
So by the subtle secret bait,
the selie beast is taken.
What it is to give and to bestow,
I will declare to thee,
If thou already do not know:
Gargilian give to me.
Of Philaene.
PHilaene never lets tears,
but from one eye to fall:
And would ye know how so it is*
she has but one in all.
Against Attalus.
Friend Attal, thou derlamest well,
thou pleadest causes well:
The Histories do pass thou makst,
thy Verses do excel.
Thou make merry Poems, and
thy Epigrams are fine:
In Grammar, and the course of Stars,
thy knowledge is divine,
Both well thou singest Attalus,
and dauncest light withal:
Thy art does pass to play on harp,
or toss the Tennice ball.
When naught thou do is well, yet all
thou do thou think right:
Will thou I tell what one thou art:
Ardelio, Thraso like.
Against Posthumus.
WHat shall I say this same to be?
thy garments all and some
Do smell of Mirrhe, and save of Mirrhe
no sent does from thee come.
This Posthumus do I suspect,
that still thou smellest well:
But Posthumus he smelles not well,
who allwaies well does smell:
Against Zoilus.
BY reason of his Couerled
fo^re sick does Zoilus lie:
He sickness faines, to show his clothes
of costly purpledye*
Brave bed he has car^d curious fine*
and painted fair and gay:
What does his fained si^knes, but
his substance vain bewray:
What nedest thou Phisiti^ us tell?
they do but thee delude.
Will thou be well: take to thee then
my homly mantell rude.
Of Sertorius.
SErtorius, nothing finisheth,
all things he does begin.
When as Sertorius drinks, likewise
he makes none end I win.
Against Apicius.
THy tongue Apicius taunteth none,
by it no man is stung:
Yet Porringers, and Platters both,
complain still of thy tongue.
To Fabianus.
THou being honest, pure, and poor,
true both in tongue, and heart*
Why do thou ^^udge in town to dwell,
and from the (...) starte*
Thou can not play the brokyng band,
nor yet the reueller:
Thou can not cite for to appear
the guilty trespasser.
Thou can not boast and brag it out,
thou can do none of these:
Canus, and gra^^^ fire Glaphyrus,
thou can not praise and please.
Wherefore a miser poor thou liust,
naught gains thy goodness thee:
Be good, and never shall thou sure
like Philomelus be.
Of Caerelia, and Gellia.
Being a gerle, Caerelia calls
her self an aged dame:
And Gellia she an aged trot,
herself a gerle does name.
Ne may the one Colinus nor
the other be alowde:
The one she is ridiculous,
the other curious proud.
Of his abidyng in the country.
WHen I in country foil sweet, sappy, rest:
how I do spend and pass the time away,
If thou do long in few to have expressed,
attentive be, and mark what I shall say.
First serud on knees, the Majesty divine:
my servant next and ground I ouerlook:
To every man his task I do assign,
when this is done, I get me to my book.
For co^fortes cause, I rub my corpse with Oil:
for exercise I wrestle now and than,
With strainyng arms a crash: and tyrd with toil
I merry make, (endebted to no man)
I powder, quasse, sing, play, bath, sup, and sleep,
sometime by night, to study close I creep.
To Cinna.
MIthridates did often ming
strong poison with his wine:
Because no poison pestilent
should cause him for to pine.
So Cinna thou have wrought a fetch,
(by supping always ill:)
That famine none shall fret thee, that
no hunger shall thee kill.
Against Calistratus.
I Am I grant, and still have been
Calistrat poor, what then?
Yet do the deeds of mine not lurk
in dark obliuions Den:
My works are red the world throughout:
and this (it is said) is he:
And that, that diverse death denies,
that life has granted me.
But gorgious Mansion house of thine,
does glister all with gold,
Thy Coffers cramd with coin, are worth
whole thousands to be sold.
Great store of Land, and goodly ground
thy Plowe reares every year:
Of goodly weighty flezed sheep
whole thousands thou do shear.
Lo thus am I, and thus art thou:
but thou can never be
As I am, of the common crew
each one may be like thee.
Against Gellia.
WHile of thy gentry thou do bost,
and praisest stock of thine:
To match with one of calling good
forsakes thy fancy fine.
Tush none without some Senator
my husband I will have
Thou said, now se at last thou have
a carriar common slave.
To Quintianus.
IN cuttyng cruel cold December,
When each to other gifts do render:
Save books naught then I gave to thee,
At home most homely made by me.
Perchance thou deemst me in thy mind,
Therefore a sneek bill, snudge unkind:
I hate (I do protest) thee drifts,
And guilefull giuings of these gifts.
These gifts ar always fish hooks like:
Bayt tucht, straight taken is the Pike.
When as to rich the poor gives naught,
Then Quint should he be liberal thought.
To Aulus, against Mamercus.
MAmercus by no manner means,
may broughe and framed be
To use and rule his tongue aright,
so cankered cursed is he.
Though thou did pass in piety
the constant Curious quight:
Although thou Nerua did surmount,
for calm and quiet sprite:
Although for gentle mekenes mild
thou Druso did excel:
Although for honesty to Mar^*
thou might be likened well.
Although thou did Mauricus match
for equity and right.
Although thou could as Regulus
with filed phrase delight.
Though pleasant Paulus thou did pass
to make a merry Jest.
His rustie teeth, with rane our f^e^,
yet still would bite the best.
Perchance thou Aulus do him deem,
a man of wicked tongue:
But him a wretch deem I, which is
mislikt all men among.
To Gellia.
WHen so thou sendest me an hare,
my Gellia still thou ^aist
I shall be seven days after fair:
thus still with me thou plaist.
My Gellia if thou do not mock:
if truth thou do declare:
I dare be bold to say that thou,
did never eat an hare.
That we should benifite our friends.
THe crafty thief from battered chest,
does filch thy come away:
The debtor nor the interest,
nor principal will pay.
The fearful flame des^rdies the goods,
and lets naught remain:
The barren ground for seed receud,
restores naught again.
The subtle harlot naked strips,
her lover to the skin:
If thou commit thy self to seas,
great danger art thou in.
Not that thou geuest to thy friend,
can fortune take away:
That only that thou giust thy friend,
thou shall posses for ay.
Against Posthumus.
I Mind what thou have done for me*
and will remember eake
Always: why hold I then my peace,
and Postume do thou speak?
When any I begin to tell,
thy goodness what it is
Toward me, tush straight they say
himself erst told us this.
Believe me two to many are,
this same for to express:
One will suffice, if I shall speak,
then Posthume hold thy peace.
Though thou be frushyng frank, although
great gifts thou give, perdy
Yet perish all those gifts of thine
by thy garrulitie.
Against Candidus.
THy farms are proper to thy self,
thy gold and silver white
Thine proper, proper to thy Plate,
and crystal glasses bright.
Thy pleasant wines of sundry forts,
thine proper to no dout:
Thy proper wit: and proper to
thy heart and courage stout.
All doutles proper that thou have:
what said I all? I lie.
Thy wife she is not proper, for
she common is perdy.
To Rufinus.
I Grant, I can it not deny,
thou sure have goodly land:
Fat farms, and tenementes thou have,
and liuyngs in thine hand.
And debtors diverse owe thee much,
much coin thou have abroad:
Rich Plate of Gold and silver both,
thy table still does load.
Inferiors thine Rufinus yet,
disdain thou never a dell.
More then have thou had Didymus,
and more has Philomel.
Against Matrinia.
I Like no Beldames, I.
Matrinia do complain?
I Beldames love: but thou art none.
stark dead thou do remain.
I can well fancy Hecuba,
of Neob like alone:
Before the one be made a dog,
the other made a stone.
Of Fishes engraven.
BY Phidias art thou fishes see,
engraven feat, and trim:
Put water to them, and they will
whip, skip, frisk, frounce and swim.
Against Ligurinus.
NO man with thee will willing me^t*
and each mis takes him to his feet
Whereso thou Ligurine do come:
thy presence shinnies both all, and some*
Wilt know why thirs from thee they start?
a Poet prattlyng pert thou art.
This vice is vile all men among:
the Tigres robbed of her young,
The Dypsas scor^he with skaldyng heat,
the Scorpion that with tail does threat,
These moniters fell are not so fear^
as thou art, where that thou art heard:
For who I pray thee suffer can
as thou are such a troublous man?
To him that stands thyu do reed,
so eke to him that sits indeed.
To him that runs thou art recityng,
to him thou readst that is a sh^tyng.
Washyng at Baines, there I thee here.
I can not swim, where thou a^t near.
To meals I have, me do thou nay.
at table plast, thou go thy way.
All weary when I go to bed,
molestyng me, thou shakst my head.
What harm thou do now will thou see?
though honest, good, and just thou be,
Yet for this fault, none like of thee.
To the same Ligurinus.
THe supper of Thyestes, whether
Phoebus God divine
Mislikt I know not, Ligurine
but sure we like not thine.
Thy fare is fine and good, thy ^ates
as curious as may be:
Considering how thy tongue does walk,
yet all mislikes we see.
I care not for thy dainty meats:
I do mislike each mess:
What I would have thee do do ask?
what? marry hold thy peace.
To Aemilianus.
IF poor thou be Aemilian,
thou shall be poor always:
For none but welthy worldlyngs are
enriched now adays.
To Labienus.
WHen Labienus all alone
I saw thee sit of late*
Three men me thought I saw: I was
deceived by thy pate.
One patch of hear there stands here,
another stands there:
Deformd thy scalp: the locks do grow
I know not how, nor where.
In midst of all, thy sconse is balde:
there allies are to see:
Wherein not half a grass does grow,
so bald, and bare they be.
When as the Emperor deals his dole,
thy sconse then profits thee:
Others one Basket have of bred,
for thy part thou have three.
Thou like unto king Gerion art:
If Hercules thee spy
In Phillips Porch, (take heed I say)
dead art thou by and by.
To Lupercus.
FOr that thou suppest oftentimes
and never call me:
Lupercus I have found a way,
How to be even with thee.
I will be angry though thou send,
call, and request me still:
What will I do, do ask of me?
What? marry come I will.
To Faustinus, against an evil Physician Hermocrates.
BOth washed and supt Andragoras,
with us in health and sound:
Yet in the morn Andragoras,
stark dead in bed was found.
Would know of such so sudden death,
what should thoccasion be?
Hermocrat the Physician
in slumber he did see.
Against Phoebus.
WIth ointment made for nonce, thy pace
all over Phoeb is did:
And all thy sluttish scuruie skalpe
a painted hear does hyde.
No Barber thou do neade at all
thy head to notte, and pole:
A Sponge or painting pensile Phoeb,
will better shave thy nole.
Against the envious.
ROme lauds, and loves, and reads my works,
and singes them every where:
Each fist does hold me clutched fast,
each bosom me does bear.
One blusheth ^o, as red as fire,
anon as pale as claye:
Anon he looks astonished,
as one did him dismaye:
Sometime he mumping mockes and moes,
sometime he does repine:
Ymarrie, this is that I would:
now please me verses mine.
To Marianus.
THou know one lurketh thee to ^ueth.
and he that lurkes a lo^t
To lucre bent: thou know his drift,
and where he goes about.
Yet him thine heir thou did ordain
in will thou made last:
And madman like did will that he
should in thy room be p^a^t.
He sent thee gifts in deed: but how?
he sent them with the hook:
And can the fish the fisher love,
that for his death does look?
Trowest thou this Fox will for thy death
take any inward thought?
No, no: if thou will have him weep,
then Marian give him naught.
Of the the^e Cilix.
A Thief that Cilix had to name,
to rob an Orchard sometime came*
In all the garden great was naught
save Priapus, of Marble wrought.
What does me he, (greedy of pray,)
but hales the hugy stone away.
To Lupus.
Pensive thou art, and prosperous:
take heed lest fortune blind
Know Lupus this, lest she thee call
churl gratelesse, and unkind.
To Rufus.
A Certain man not long ago,
Gave me the gaze friend Rufus so,
As if some foolish fencer I
Had been, or one that went to buy.
With eye, and finger, when that he
Had looked long, and marked me:
Art thou (quoth he) art thou declare,
That famous pleasant Poet rare,
That men echewhere do Martial call,
Whose jests do joy both great, and small?
I somewhat smilyng, told my name,
And said I was the very same.
Why then (quoth he) so ill art clad?
Because I am a Poet had
I answered. All this is true,
Friend Rufus which I tell to you.
Good Rufus send some clothes therefore,
That I may shamed be no more.
To Amianus.
A Serpent fell thou have engraud,
in ^iluer bole of thine
Of Mirons making: poison sure
thou drinkst thou drinkst no wine.
Against Olus.
Foul filthy faulty folks there are:
what is Olus that to thee?
What matters it thou honest, what
vile vicious varlets be.
Matho at Dice plays all his co^^e:
whatts Olus that to thee?
Not thou therefore shall feel the pains,
of poor estate, but he.
Sertorius reuelles out the night:
whatts Olus that to thee?
So thou may snortyng soundly stepe.
and still in quiet be.
Much money Titus, Lupus owes:
whatts Olus that to thee?
When thou indebted art to none,
but art from all men free.
For all this Olus yet there is,
that does pertain to thee:
And that unto thy charge and care,
of duty does agree.
Thy gown to gage for coin does lie,
this to thee Olus is:
And for a farthyng no man now
will credit thee, and this.
Thy wife does make thee carry horns,
this to thee Olus is:
Thy daughter now a dowry great
requires of thee, and this.
Much more beside I could declare
what does pertain to thee:
But Olus what pertaines to thee,
does naught pertain to me.
To Castor.
CAstor, thou every thing do buy:
Sell every thing thou will perdy.
To his Muse.
Five books had been sufficient:
or six, or seven in deed:
And to much to: why then my Muse
to sport do thou proceed?
Fie, fie, forbear, and make an end:
my fame abroad is spread:
And no man talked of more then I.
my books each where be red.
And when the stones of Messala
shall lie, and be forlorn:
When Marble stones of Licinus
to powder shall be worn,
Yet every mouth shall speak of me:
and many a geste with him
Shall carry to his country cost,
my works and poems trim.
I ended. Lo, then spoke one of
the sacred sisters nine,
Which had her bosom and her locks
besmeerd. with ointments (...).
Can thou, can thou vngracefull churl
(quoth she) find in thy heart:
To play as thou have purposed,
so fond a thanklesse part?
Can thou forsake thy pleasant toys,
and trifles that excel?
How better can be occupied
when thou ar^ Idle, tell?
In lofty style wilt rather choose
feirce tragedies to write?
Or else of blows, and blody blades
had rather to indite?
Then every skowlyng scholemaster
would read with harshie voice
Thy verse, then neither lad nor less
would in thy style rejoice.
The frownyng sage, and sour severe
these kind of things do write,
Who miserably spend their time
in study day and night.
Use rather thou thy Romain Jests,
and pleasauntly repeat
Thy sawes, and as for them, let them
of what they list entreat.
Although with s^klender Oten pipe
thou seemst perdy to sing:
Thou do surpass the Trumpet, loud
that in the ears does ring.
To Priscus.
DO ye demand a welthy wenche
why that I will not wed?
I nill be bound for to obaye,
my wife at every sted.
The matrons ( Priscus) to the man
must still inferior be:
Else shall they not be equal, nor
like man and wife agree.
To a married couple, that could not agree.
Since that you both are like in life,
(a naughty man, a wicked wife:)
I muse ye live not void of strife.
Of Fabius, and Chrestella.
HIs wives still buries Fabius*
Christella contrary
Her husbands buries: none they match
withal, but straight they dye.
Now Hymen cause these conquerours
together both to link:
That so one Bear may bear them both
to their sepultures brinke.
Against Gallicus.
WHen me thine Heir of all thy lands
to make thou did swear
By all the gods, that rule above,
and by thine hory hear,
I thee beleud: for willingly
who will himself forswear?
And still in hope to speed, with gifts
I did thee feed and cheer.
Among my gifts a Boar I sent,
great, fat, a weighty one:
As huge and monstrous mighty big,
as that of Calidone.
Thou straight way did send for, and feast,
the rich and eak the poor:
All Rome does belche and surfeit yet,
with eating of my Bore.
My self the giver (who would think?)
the better naught did fare:
I nothing had, ne ryb ne rumpe
did fall unto my share.
Friend Gallicus what should I hope
thy land to gain of thee?
When that no morsel of mine own,
thou would give to me.
Of Priscus, his banquet.
THe learned Priscus books bewray
what banquet is the best:
In pleasant style is much declard,
In lofty much expressed.
But sure with learning great declard
there is both all and some:
Wilt know what banquet is the best?
where Minstrelles none do come.
Against Cinna.
AN Astrologian Cinna said
that quickly thou should dye,
Thy fate he did fortell thee thus:
and sure he did not lie.
For whilst thou did fear thou should
leave much behind to spend,
Thou reueling did roist it out
and madst of all an end*
Not one year fully was expirde
but all was gone wellny:
Declare me Cinna now, is this
not quickly for to dye?
To Condilus.
THat thou so long a serua^a^ libft
why Condil do complain?
A masters grief thou (...) know,
nor yet servant gain.
Thy hard and homely couch does yield
thee quiet sleep and rest:
When Caius lo lies brood awake
with cramping cares oppressed.
For fear thy master dare not, but
salute whom so he meets:
When thou may iet with cap on crown,
and careless strut the streets.
One comes to master thine and says
give that thou owst to me:
And stays him in the street, and none
so Condil does to thee.
Thou fearst a pat on pate, or else
a whirrit on the ear:
But gronyng he with gre^^, and gowt,
his fatal fine does fear*
Speak Condil, had not rather now
still have a servant place
Then be a master, and remain
in Caius cursed case:
Against Aphe^.
AS often as I behold thy wife,
when as with thee I (...),
Thou lowryng Apher bendst thy brow,
as though than did (...).
What fault? tell what offe^^e (...)
thy wife for to (...)
The sun, the stars, the thrun^ed thrones
with silver perle and gold,
And eak the gods themsel^e^ (...)
what should I turn aside,
And flap my hand on face* as th^^ugh,
some Roman grim I spide
A hoorson fell was Hercules,
yet Hilas we might see:
With pretty Ganimed to play,
M. still had license free.
If thou will have thy guests to wink,
and not thy wife to see:
Let Phineas blind, and Oedipus,
thy guests then Apher be.
Against Crispus.
THou say thou art as much my friend
as any man can be:
But now, to prove this true thou say,
what do thou Crisp for me?
I would have borrowed coin of thee,
thou did me deny,
What time thou had as much as well
could in thy coffer lie.
When gave thou me a busshell tell,
of Beans or any grain?
When as to plow thy fertile ground
thy plowman took the (...)?
When gave thou me a Frocke of Frise
my corpse from cold to (...)?
Or when of silver half a pound
did thou unto me send?
Naught else I see, whereby I may
believe my friend thou art:
But that before me oftentimes
thou gerdest out a fart.
To Phileros.
Seven wives of thine now Phileros
in ground engraued be:
The ground to none so bountiful,
as Phileros to thee.
To himself.
MArtial, the things that do attain
the happy life, be these I find*
The riches left, not got with pain,
The fruitful ground, the quiet mind:
The egall friend, no grudge no strife,
No charge of rule nor governance,
Without desease the healthful life,
The household of continuance.
The mean diet, no delicate fare,
True wisdom joined with simplenes,
The night discharged of all care,
Where wine the wit may not oppress.
The faithful wife without debate,
Such sleeps as may beguile the night,
Content thy self with thine estate,
Ne wish for death, nor fear his might.
Otherwise.
THe things which cause (...) life me thinks
most full of bliss to be,
Are these: when goods from friends do fall,
and we from labor free.
When fertile field grows fast abroad,
and mind is void of strife:
And merry Ihon by tostyng fire,
may sit with Ione his wife.
When corpse is sound and strong with all,
and wisdom rules the mind:
And friends in frenships faithful knot,
a faithful heart does bind.
When fare is good, though not of cost,
and night with pleasure pressed,
Not drowsy head, but merry mind,
does cause a quiet rest.
To be as heart could wish or crave,
thy state content withal:
Not fear, nor wish for fatal day,
but come when come it shall.
Against Carmenion.
Since that Carmenion you do crack
of Corinth that you are
A citezen, and so say all,
I marvel how you dare
And with what face and honesty
call me your brouher: why?
You know in Spain that I was borne
eke there I dwell perdy.
What do we look alike? no sure:
and why it shall appear:
Thou wandrest trixsie trimsie fine,
with crispt and curled hear.
But all disordered lie my locks
after the Spanish guise:
Thou do with ointments rid thine here,
rough are my legs, and eyes.
An amerous flatteryng tongue have thou,
speaking nice, neat, and fine:
Not half so womannish as thine,
is daughters tongue of mine.
Look how the Dove does differ from
the chefest bird of all:
Look how the Dear does differ from
the Lion strong and tall:
So differ we: wherefore I say,
Carmenion, brother thine
Cease me to call hereafter, lest
I call thee sister mine.
To Gallus.
IF so my grief will do thee good,
I will be up and dight,
Before Aurora do appear
and chase away the night.
I will about, when plunging puffes
vpturneth towns and towers:
I Will bide the bruntes of frost and snow
and hidious hissyng showers.
But if no better thou awhit,
if naught at all thou gain
By this my troublous toil and grefe,
and griefly pinchyng pain,
Spare thou my tired ghost, and from
these torments make me free:
Which help not Gallus thee a whit,
but hurt and hinder me*
To Philenis
Do ask with plaster on my chin
why that I walk about?
Philenis mine I do not mind
to kiss thee out of doubt.
To Cherimon.
Since like a Stoike, Cherimon,
thou praisest death so much:
Thou would be praisde, and wondered at,
as though there were none such.
What makes thee death desire so much?
thy broken pitcher pot*
Thy homely rascal har^h, that burns,
with fire seldom hot.
Thy mat^e, and eke thy bedstead bare,
with stinkyng Cimex fret:
Thy cu^^olde cal^oke cold, wherein
thou still art feign to iet:
O what a stout courageous man
is this? how manly bold?
That loves no dregs of Vinegar,
nor holme, nor brownbread old,
Well go to: if upon a bed
of dowle thou should lie:
And if thy couche were costly clad
with clothes of purple dye.
Then, then, full often would thou wish
thrice Nestors years to live:
No time then would thou lose, but still
thy self to pleasure give.
An easy thing in penury,
this life for to despise:
Who can bear torment patiently,
it is he that's counted wise.
To Parthenope.
THy chaps and jaws Parthenope,
a cruel cough does grieve:
To help thee, the Physician
unto thee still does give
Nutkernels short, fine honey sweet,
and cracknels of the best,
And all such things as children please,
and make to be at rest.
Yet notwithstanding all this gear,
thou coughest still perdy
Ye are a crafty knave, you cough
to fare deliciously.
Against Zoilus.
HE did not term thee Zoilus right,
who termde thee vicious elfe:
If he should term thee truly, he
should term thee vice it self.
To Vacerra.
A Flatterer, and a slaunderer,
Also a crafty cossener,
A trifler vain, a whoremunger,
A fine foincastyng fenceplaier,
All these Vacerra though thou be:
I muze, yet money wants with thee.
To Polla.
WHy Polla me do garlands send
so fair, so fresh, so fine?
Send rather me some Roses rubde
with lilly hands of thine.
Of Legeia.
IF Legeas years and hears agree:
Then just three years of age is she.
Of Affricanus.
AS rich as Cresus Affric is:
for more yet hunts the chuffe:
To much to many, Fortune gives,
and yet to none inuffe.
To Fabullus. Of Themnon.
FAbullus friend do ask me, why
has Themison no wi^e?
He loves to be in quiet, free
from bate, and brawlyng strife.
Against Thelesinus.
WHen that no gage nor paune I bring,
and of thee coin do crave:
I can not help thee strait thou say:
gage ground and thou shall have.
So thou no credit giust at all,
unto me Thelesine:
Thine old companion, and thy friend,
but trustest ground of mine.
Lo Carus has thee guilty found,
and banished must thou be:
Would have me bear thee company?
naie, call my ground to thee.
To Julius.
IF thou will eschew bitter adventure,
And avoid the gnawyng of a pensive heart:
Set in no one person all wholly thy pleasure,
The less shall you joy, but less shall you (...).
To Phoebus.
WIth hyde of Kid, thine head in (...),
to cover baldness thine:
He quipt thee home, who ^olde thee Phoeb*
thy sconse was clouted fine.
To one diversely conditioned.
FAtile, and froward art thou sure,
faunyng, and also fell:
With thee I can not live, nay bide,
nor yet without thee dwell.
Against Zoilus.
BLack head, red beard, short feet thou have*
and poreblinde eke thou art:
It Is ten to one, but Zoilus thou
do harbor harm in heart.
Otherwise.
Black head, red beard short feet thou have,
and eke thou art poreblinde:
Thou woorkst a wonder Zoile, if thou
have any good in mind.
Against Policarnus.
TEn times in twelve mo^thes thou art sick
or oftener, Policarme:
And this thy sickness never thee,
but friends of thine does harm.
For after health recovered still,
thy friends thou asked gifts:
For shame be sick but once a year,
and leave these guilefull shifts.
EX. XENIIS, ET APOPHORETIS, MARTIALIS.
Wheat flower.
THe profits great, none may repeat
of flower so fine perdie:
Since for the Cook, and Baker both,
it serves to occupy.
Lettuce.
Since that our ancients used to eat,
Lettuce when all was done:
I muse why every meal of us,
with Lettuce is begun.
Leekes often cut.
STrong sentyng Leekes of Tarentine,

Be sure to kiss thy less with lips,
together clinched fast.

All which time naught but slu^beryng sleep
does make me fat perdy.
The Conie.
THe little Conie loves to scoute,
In Berries, that are dug out:
By these our foes in elder days,
Have learned many secret ways.
The Ringdoue, or Stockdoue.
THe Stockdoues secret parts,
make lumpishe, dull, and dedde:
Shun him to eat, if thou will be
with lively courage spedde.
The Peacocke.
THou wondrest when he spreads abroad,
his wyngs that glisteryng look:
And can thou find in heart, to give
him to the cruel Cook?
The Swanne.
WIth warblyng note, he tuneth verse.
The Swanne does sweetly sing
Before his death, cracyng a long
the stream with fethered wyng.
A shelfishe, in Latin Murex.
(Churl as thou art) with our blood,
thy clothes are purple died:
Yet this is not sufficient,
we made are meat beside.
The Gogion.
ALthough in Venice feasts they make,
and still have dainty chere*
Yet with a Gogeon they begin,
their suppers lightly there.
The Hare.
Amongst birds the ^hrushe is bent,
and bears away the bell:
Amongst beasts the Have is best,
and does the rest excel.
Does.
THe tuske the Bore does well defende^
the horn the Heart does shield:
Poor s^^ie Does what else are we,
but preyes to Dogs in feeld*
Wine of Tarentum.
AVlon has Woolles most excellent,
and Grapes most goodly fine:
Take thou the ponderous weighty felles,
give me the precious Wine.
Sweet oil or ointment.
NOr wine nor oyntme^t leave thine heir:
let him possess thy pelf
For his part and these other give
all only to thy self.
Chestes made of Iuery.
IN coffers these put nothing else
save yellow (...) gold:
Chests homely rude less precious,
may silver serve to hold*
(...)
SMall dice and nu^^es, feme tri^ing ^oyes,

Yet these have made boys but tockes smart
with rods, not once* nor twice.
The comb, to the bald pate.
WIth boxen comb, thick toothed sharp,

when as no hear upon thy head does grow.
The Coffer wherein books are laid.
Tie streict, bind hard thy books in me:
lest that with Mothes consumd they be.

THy Candle bright, of chamber thine
the secrets all I know:
Do what thou list, I still am whist,
No secrets I do show.
A Candlestick of wood.
THou see that wood I am, unless
thy light thou do well watch:
A Candle great shall I become,
the flame if once I catch.
Bellovves.
FResh ^riskyng youth be packyng hence,
Mild age agrees with me:
Boys bellows best beseem, and syres
that frosty ^erded be.
A medicine by rubbyng to make the teeth white.
TEll? what have thou to do with me?
fair gerles and maidens ought
Me for to use: I trim (...)
made, counterfeit, and bought.
A Lantern of Horn.
A Lantern bright (incloasing light)
the way I show thee best:
The candle in my bosom put
does shroud, and safely rest.
A Fly flap of Peacockes plumes.
THe tail of princely Peacock prove,
that glisteryng fair does show,
May serve to flap the filthy flies
upon thy meat that blow.

I Pratyng Parret am, to speak
some strange thing* learn ye me:
This of my self I learnd to speak,
Caesar alhai^e to thee.
The Nightingale.
Fair Philomela howles, for fact
Of Tereus filthy king:
A maid she could not speak, a byrd
she loud and shrill does sing.
The Pie.
A Chatteryng Pie am I, and do
salute my master thee:
If me thou saw not, thou would sure
deem me no bird to be.
Cups of Crystal.
WHen thou do fear to break these cups,
then do thou break them still:
Bold hands are ill to hold these cups,
and fearful hands are ill.
A Girdle.
NOw long am I, but when with child
thy belly shall bear out:
Than gerdle short I shall be made,
and scant thee come about.
Hay.
WHen feathers want, to stuff thy couche

Pale care does seldom come to couche
on hard and homely bed.
Leander.
LEander bold, in weltring waves
cride, spare me now ye Seas
Until my lady I have seen,

The Tumbler.
NOt for himself, but for his lord,
the tumbler hunteth free:

the Leueret unto thee.
The Ram.
WIth Butchers knife thou carved have,
the Ram his tender throat:
Deservd he this which unto thee
so often gave his coat?
The Havvke.
A Rauener foul of foul he was,
now faulckoners servant he:
He birds beguiles yet gains not
the birds that taken be.
A Cook.
It Is not sufficient for a Cook
a Cook for to be tryde:
A Cook must know his masters mouth,
and appetite beside.
A baker of fine Cakes, or like things.
A Thousand sweet delicious knackes
he forms fine, by skill:
For him alone they busy be*
does toil and labor still.
PICTORIVS.
To Leonellus. Submission.
THy mountyng mind does still aspire,

And Leonel thou would be
Magister totum fac.
And whilst thou ^owtst thus putt with pride,
and deemst thou do excel
All else beside, thou driuest thy self,
to deepest pit of hell.
Ah, yet at length submit thy self,
let Pride thee not be guile:
Dear shall thou be to Christ if tho^t
seem to thy self as, bi^e*
Sorovvyng for the dead*
THou weepest still, thou skrechest shrill,
thou halest from head thine hears:
Thy face all torn with scratchyng claws,
like S. Ihons face appears.
Do think thy so^ne^ ^^p^rted hence,
may thus again he had*
To sorrow for the dead, ^s but
Greef unto (...) ad*
To Titus. Naughtines borne withal.
I Mused what should be the cause,
why men do nothing fear
Nor shame to do offenses, such
as heinous do appear:
When ^o I heard a voice which spoke,
the words whereof were such:
Ah, wicked deeds and cursed crimes,
are cockered to to much.
To A man thankeles.
FOr kinreds sake and courtesy,
thou often do require:
For frendships cause and amity,
again thou do desire.
And comfort none thou do receive,
of friend, nor yet of brother:
And why? because thou will not do
for one good turn, another.
To Sextus. Pity: alms.
Proud Palaces with battlements,
thou have erected hie:
Thy farms and manner howses, storde
with every thing do lie.
Thou do abound in beds of town,
thy fare is passing fine:
Thy clothes are costly to thy back:
all passing that is thine.
Upon thy self, thy goods and coin
thou spendest evermore:
Do ask how bet they may be spent
how? marry on the poor.
To Baptista Castellus.
ALL men (as well the rich as poor)
of force must one day die:
And more are rich men hurt by store,
then poor by penury.
Goods, seldom (they) do bring to God:
a Cable shall go in
Much sooner through a Nedels eye,
then Dives heaven win.
To Zoylus. Weepyng tears.
A Shipwreck thou have made of late:
from blubberyng tears refrain:
Lost goods, by ^oud lamentyng cries,
may not be got again.
Thy breast is Zoyl a sink of sins:
thou still have gone astraye:
Wherefore wail Zoylus for thy sins,
tears wash men's sins away:
But thou do laugh my words to scorn:
no force, laugh if thou please:
Yea laugh thy fill, sweet honey still
the sickly does displease.
To Homer. an Hyprocite.
I Can not choose but praise thee, that
thou earnest art in Prayer:
And that unto the Temple thou
so often make repair.
That Idleness thou doste eschew,
which breeds a lothsum life:
That thou will not be seen to talk,
with any others wife.
That thou do not in usury
nor honor vain delight:
Yet Homer, all thing is not gold
that shines and glisters bright.
To Zeno. Castigation.
HE is not still an enemy
that makes to smart, and smites:
Ne is he still a faithful friend
that pleases and delights.
Far better sure it is to have,
sour Zeno us to love:
Then he that sekes by flat^ery fair,
for to allure and move.
To Caper. tauntes. backbityngs.
THou doste complain, thy fate
unlucky still to be,
Because that Fabius froward fool
bites, blames, and sclaunders thee.
Caper content thy self,
who is reproched, he
No miser is, the Sycophantes
themselves the misers be.
To Criticus. Children must be instructed.
SOft claye, may formde and framed be
how and to what you will,
The tender wax, to any shape,
is pressed and pliant still:
So youth in tender years may be
instructed hou you list,
And how they frame themselves in youth,
so lightly they persist.
Wherefore in virtue, Criticus
instruct thy child betyme:
To no admonishment their ears
the grauer sore incline.
To Quirinus.
Men's faces diverse are and strange:
so are their hearts likewise:
And what lies hidden in the heart,
none may discern with eyes.
For some you see that gentle seem,
and courteous outwardly:
When scorchyng hatred in their heart
does burn incessantly.
Some Damons dear, in face appear,
and Demons dire in chest:
So selde or never still you see,
the browe bewraies the breast.
And friend Quirinus, Calaber
the king does favor thee,
Yet may thou he assurde of this,
none more thy foe then he*
Perchance my boldness some will blame,
no force, I care not, I:
Nothing may lurk or be concelde,
where friendship firm does lie.
To Visus. a backbiter.
FOr that I did refuse,
Vrsus to answer thee
About Religion.
thou musest much a^me.
I give no holy things to dogs,
a carpyng currishe wighte,
No better then a curre I count,
which still does bark and bite.
To Philenius. a flatterer.
THe Mallarde when she sees the Hawk,
in haste she hies away:
When horned Heart beholds the Dog,
no longer does he stay.
So friend Philenius, sugared words
eschew, as enmies darte:
The faunyng flatterer worse then foe,
does smite, and make to smarte.
To Petrus. Love dissimuled.
Unless some worthy work in verse,
I do present to thee:
Thou say all love and frendlinesse,
shall cease, twixt thee and me.
Even when you please, I am content,
a Fly for such a friend:
Leude is the love that does not last,
but startyng; takes end.
To Arnus. Surfeit.
Do ask with sundry sicknesses,
why men are vexed so:
By diverse deintie dishes sure,
diseases diverse grow.
Our elders that one dishe did use,
did healthful still endure:
Then skant ten herbs in field were found,
an hurt or sore to cure.
Now hills, and woods, and seas are sought:
all places more, and less:
And eke we practice Magic art,
and such like deuilishnesse.
And yet our soars excede our salues,
and needs it must be so:
For men will rather lose their lives,
then gluttony forgo.
To Marius. Armor and weapon against the devil.
AGainst the sly deceiptes,
of Satan tyrant fell*
My Marius, would thou know
how to be fensed well:
First curet thine must be,
All pride for to expel:
Thy helmet, as thy self,
To love thy next as well.
Thy buckler that must be,
A chaste unspotted breast:
Use patience for thy brigandine,
when Fortune does molest.
To Cosmicus. Curiosity in decking the body.
WIth odours sweet of Siria soil,
thy garments all do smell:
If corpse thou wash not thrice adaie,
thou think it is not well.
Thy bushe of hear is braided brave
and friseled woondrous fine:
No spot or mole does once deforme,
the comely corpse of thine.
Do these beseme a servant, of
the living Lord of light:
No man that setts so by him self,
can please the Lord a right.
To Pamphilus. friendship.
IF thou do bid me range abroad,
by sa^de, or else by seas:
To pleasure thee, I will be priest:
I nill regard mine ease.
No monstrous beast with grashyng chaps,
in desert that does bide,
Shall me deter: nor rumblyng waves,
of Occian sea so wide.
Ice, scorchyng heat of Summer hot:
storms, that so fearce are thought:
Rocks, ratlyng hail, rain, all will I
contemn and set at naught.
Perchance thou deemst I speak and prate,
to to outragiouslie:
Tushe Pamphil, what a friend can do,
no tongue can speak perdie.
Repentance.
IF thou will have me deem, that thou
repentst thee of thy sin:
To sin a fresh in woonted wise,
see thou do not begin.
What beast is he, which being washed
in waves of flowyng flood.
Will strait go haske him self afresh^
in durte, and dablyng mudde.
To Propertianus. a Niggarde.
WHo not vouchsafes himself to help,
( Philenis miser he,)
Do think Propercian he will give,
they land he (...) thee?
Who will deceive him (...) doubt
an other will beguile:
No credit is for to be given,
unto a miser vile.
To Lazarus. Vice in honor.
Do marvel why mine anger is,
so great as now it is:
My soul lothes Lazarus to live,
in such a world as this.
Who pointed are to punish sin,
themselves sin openly:
This man he spends the Orphants goods,
this keeps them wrongfully.
Now Judges bribed are each where,
now hands are gresde apace:
Now now suborned witnesses,
all things in piteous case.
In fine, my loving Lazarus,
who is not bent to vice:
They count him now a coxcombe fool,
a noddie, nothing wise.
To Paulus B. Of an harlot.
BEcause Elisia laughes on thee,
Paul therefore thou art glad:
To joy in ones own misery,
a mischief to to bad.
Perchance she flattereth thee, and says
she never will thee leave:
Ah, never credit harlot smothe,
she always does deceive.
To Ponticus. Examples.
Away with thine admonishements
and speech so pleasant fine:
Much move examples Ponticus,
small move those words of thine.
An easy matter for to speak,
but for to do, it is hard:
Do as thou say, else what thou say,
we will not we regard.
To Marianus. Stable abidyng.
THou haste begun the pathe to shun,
that leads to vice, it is well:
And for because thou haste done so,
my joy no tongue can tell.
But yet remember this bith way,
not he that does begin:
But who perseuers to the end,
shall glories garlande win.
Lithernes.
IN days of old were champions stout,
That lusty, long in health held out:
For why? of them was slurgyng slothe,
And gluttony avoided both:
Now deintie dishes hasten death,
And bedds bereue our bodies breath.
To Larius. Infirmities.
THe grievous gouce putts thee to pain:
From women, cares, and wine refrain:
This sickness sore, and greef of thine,
May bring to pass, that law divine,
Could never bring to pass in thee:
A new man this male make thee be.
This greef thee unto God may win:
With doloures joys do often begin.
To Maximus. a M^se^.
THis is thy cast still, Maximus,
th^^ is lest evermore:
Because thou will not spend thy goods,
thou sparst to feed the poor.
Ah caitiffe ^arle, how art thou witcht
with blind desire of gain:
Know not that carkyng covetousness,
bryngs hell and ho^lyng pain?
The carle charletts the poor to pine,
and saues his paultrie pelf,
What seeks he but to spa^e his goods,
and quight to spill him self?
Lust unsatiate.
Black Proserpine has never sucked,
of human blood her fill:
The dry insatiable ground,
does thurst for moisture still.
And though thou cast (and never cease)
whole forests in the fire:
It says not ho, for more it calls,
more still it does desire.
So gredy lust unsatiate,
does not contented bide,
Until it has destroid the corpse,
and eke the soul beside.
To Ollus Patience.
NE tears avail the ^ieke, indence
nor those, in grave now d^d:
Ne pearcyng plaintes when ship is sunk,
stand Mariners (...).
So fades no whit thy fury Oll,
when thou do rage and rore:
But rather through thy greu^us as groans,
augments it more and more.
What thou do suffer take in worth,
and hear with patient mind:
What thou do bear against thy will,
more lodesome shall thou find.
To Iacobus Melitus. Detraction.
LEad still a godly life,
well still thy self behave:
Yet thee shall wicked tongues
reproach, and eke deprave.
It is the pastime and delight
Of Zoyles, at good men still to spite.
To Vincentius Nouatus. shunsloth.
IF thou Vincentius carest for
the health that still does last:
Then far from thee continually,
see sluggish sloth thou cast.
When basking slothful in the sun,
the fiend his foe does see:
Then then with mighty hand always
to weapon runs he:
But whom he sees to labor pressed,
them lets he still alone:
He labor lothes, and loves the luske.
to ease and pleasure prone.
To Flaccus. Extortioners, Cormorauntes.
ONe silly drop of water asked
the glotton greedy gorche
With humble suit, to swage the heat
that so his tongue did scorche:
Yet never robbed he as I reed,
the poor of ought him self to feed.
If that be cause he would not give,
thus plaugd the rich man was
With torments such in hell, what shall
become of them (alas)
That nothing give, but still oppress
poor widows, and the fatherles.
To Marullus. Almesdeedes.
Do fear that God will angry be,
and turn away his face from thee
Marullus mine? I will there tell
a way, how to be safe and well.
Thy face turn thou not from the poor:
God, like for like, pays evermore.
The good man fears naught.
IF fortune do but bend the browe,
and ner so little strike:
Thou out of courage straight art dashed,
I never saw the like.
And yet thou countst thy self for good:
but by no reason sure:
For goodmen they with manly hearts,
do all mishaps endure.
Let murdring Mars be modie mad,
let fire and flame destroy:
Let frettyng famine pine and pain,
let mischefes all annoye.
With stout coragious minds, all things
good honest men sustain:
Knowing that hereby, only they,
their haven and heaven obtain.
By miseries and dangers great,
by death it self, we go,
Unto the sweet celestial coast,
where pleasures all do flow.
To Doinisius Feb. The holy Scripture.
ALl things the fragrant field does feed,
according unto kind:
The bird has seed: the ox has straw:
the dog his pray does find.
Even so the sacred Bible book,
for every kind and sort
Has store of food and norishment,
that list thereto resort.
Here tender babes have milk and pap:
here ripe of years have bred:
Here also wants not repast
for age with hory head.
Yet hereof small account is made,
the cause may soon be known:
Each one does seek to feed his ears,
and let his heart alone.
To Archemedorus. A Cussoner.
Pears, Birds, to Julius thou do send,
all things both great and small:
And lord, and king, and little god,
thou always do him call.
What means all this Archemedore?
what think to get by this?
To coosen horie hears, perdie
no easy thing it is.
To Linus. Vice.
GO thou where Phoebus scorching burns,
or go where Borias reigns:
Go hide thy self in dampishe dens,
where darkness black rentaines.
Go where and to what place thou will be,
thy sins will follow thee?
By change of place, this certain is,
vice cannot chaunges be.
If thou be faulty, from thy mind
all vice abandon clear:
And Linus lead another life,
and dwell not other where.
To one very timorous.
NOw Does we may call desperate,
and Hearts coragious bol^e:
For Does, and Hearts, less timorous
then thee a thousand fold.
To be afraid where is no fear,
is sign of dastardie:
And soon the faint of courage fall
in snares of Satan sly.
Against all danger, and mishap,
the chefest thing no dout
Is for to have a prudent head,
and heart coragious stout.
Fear not the coming of mishappe,
but when that it is come:
Then stick unto thy tacklyng stout,
and bear both all and some.
To Katharina.
THe rumor goes, and told it is
(mine own good Katharine)
That thou do blaze my name abroad,
and laud the deeds of mine.
Use measure in thy words, and leave
thy laudyng so of me:
Whom women laud are seldom likt,
but still suspected be.
And for thou shall no ill misdeeme,
nor me unthankful call:
I thank thee here, let this suffice
in recompense of all.
A Virgin rare renoumd thou art.
now will thou know of me
What best and most beseemes a maid:
ay blushing red to be.
B. DARDANIVS.
A lively description of Hope.
THou that on totteryng globe do stand,
art thou a Gods* tell
Or else a mortal creature borne?
a gods. Very well.
Whence sp^ong, or how begotten, speak?
of darkness spryng did I.
What nurse did feed and give thee suck?
that did credulity.
Who at thy back behind thee bides?
joys, which do glad and ch^re.
And what is he, that still so pale
does go before thee? fear.
Alofte up to the lofty heavens,
thy looks why do thou cast?
I do behold the heavens, whereas
I hope to dwell at last.
But tell me now, what does deforme
thy face so fair and bright?
I vexed am when my desires,
are void and frustrate quight.
By staff why do thou stay thy self?
while hope does feed my mind:
Old crooked age with stealyng steps,
encrocheth on by kind.
Why reelst thou staggeryng to and fro?
hope still does slipperie stand:
The thing which often I think to hold,
does slip out of my hand.
The Description of Justice.
WHat hights thy name, thou gods tell?
my name does Justice hight.
Why lookst thou fell? tears, plants, nor bribes
may make me go from right.
Borne of what stock? of Gods above.
thy parents names descrie?
Measure my sire, my mother trust,
my nurse was penury.
A babe who lulde thee in her lap?
fair Prudence noble dame.
By whom do thou the guilty know?
Judgment does show the same.
Why bears thy left hand ballaunces:
thy right a shinyng blade?
The one does ponder causes just:
to plague the sword is made.
So few why are there thee to aid?
good men are vanished quight.
Who does thee still associate?
poor plainness pure and bright.
Why is thy one ear open wide:
thy other closed fast?
The good, they always must be heard:
the bad, they must be cast.
Why in apparel art thou poor?
who will be just and right,
Shall never while he lives, become
a rich and wealthy wight.
Verses of Dardanus, sent to Dominicus Saulus.
SOme men for gifts, give glisteryng gold
and some give precious stones:
Some Iuerie, costly glasses some
wrought curious for the nones.
Some guiftes do give of graven work,
and housbandmen do bring
Nutts, cornailes, apples, pears, and plumms,
and many a pretty thing.
But since I want the fertile ground,
where all these things should grow:
And since my feelds with golden streams
of Pactol, do not flow,
I can not thee such presents give:
but in the stead of them,
I verses send unto thee here:
I have nor gold nor gem.
But if thou say they are no gifts,
but trifles worthy naught:
I pray thee what of Irus poor,
to Croesus may be brought?
The song of S. Jerome in the deseit.
THou stranger, lo with ragged stones
I beat and bounce my breast:
I wail my sins, my grievous synns
wherewith I am oppreste.
I do lament my leude led life,
and former oversight:
(Ah blessed and treble blessed again,
the pure unspotted wight.)
If gronyngs great, get grace at God,
and loud lamentyngs, love:
I hope my piteous pearcyng plaintes,
shall God to mercy move.
All tisyng talk I do avoid,
from envy I depart:
And shun I do occasions all,
that weak the manly heart.
Wherefore I have betane my self,
in desert here to dwell:
Among a rout of rauenyng beasts,
ferce, furious, frantic fell.
And what though in this wilderness
no wight will come and see
Me grisly wretch: yet here always
my God remains with me.
No man that loves God a right
(in woods or deserts wide)
But has sufficient company
and comfort to beside.
Here chitteryng birds do chirp and chaunt,
in heat here pleasant shade:
Here want not crystal quiueryng springs,
wherein to wash and wade.
A pittance here suffices well:
I banquets set not by:
And here, because I wish for naught,
I naught am wantyng, I.
Here hunger is the only sauce,
that likes my stomach best:
Here nothing me mislikes: enough
suffices as a feast.
Here fruit bringes forth the fertile soil,
Vntoylde and eke untilled:
In stead of bed I lie on leaves,
wherewith the woods are filde.
With blot or blame, I none defame,
alone here as I dwell:
Nor gnawyng envy hurts me,
I here do live so well.
No glory, nor ambition vain
do here torment my mind:
I glory but in God alone,
and him I hope to find.
Here Venus prinked up in pride
and pranked, fine and gaie
Does never come: no lust does last,
but hence departs away.
In pleasant shade when so I please,
I sleep and take my rest:
No thundryng trump nor thumpyng thief,
my slumbryngs here moleste.
My mind is not on money set,
I do not heap nor hoo^de:
Alone I seek to please my God,
and to embrace his word.
All things beside the word of God,
are even as drizslyng miste:
Fond, vile and vain, of none effect,
let men say what them list.
Often times here comes and faunes on me,
fearce Lions furious fell*
And diverse dreadful beasts besides,
that in the woods do dwell.
And still the Lord does lend me help
against death and dangers all:
I stand in dread of nothing I,
for on the Lord I cal^.
Yet here among these raggie rocks,
and beasts of cruel mood:
Where fountain water is my drink,
where herbs do serve for food.
Here sensual pleasure does assault,
to win me by her might:
But still with reason I resist,
and chase her from my sight.
But thou which liuste at pleasure thine,
and all things haste at will:
Which soft do lie, which do with cates
and wine thy beallie fill.
Ah wretch with heat of filthy lust,
what torments do thou try?
When she for to assault thy mind,
with hasty stepps does hye.
ANGELVS POLITIANVS.
To Pamphilus.
THou sendst us wine: we want no wine,
my Pamphil trusty friend*
Wilt send us what we want and wish?
then thurst my Pamphil send.
To his Lady beloved.
IN rage thou turnest me away,
again thou do me take:
Thou hard at heels do follow me,
yet me thou do forsake.
Kind art thou, courteous eke,
yet cankered, cursed again:
Thou will, and wilt not: me thou louste,
and me thou putst to pain.
Thou promise makst, and it forsakst:
in deep despair I pine,
Yet live in hope: Ah Tantal would
my state were like to thine.
A painful plague in cristall streams,
to be a thirst and dry:
But what a plague to be a thirste,
sweet Nectar standing by?
BRVNO.
A true saying.
ONce wooden Challices there were,
Then golden priests were every where:
Now golden chalices there be,
And wooden priests each where to see.
To Omellia.
THou maruelest Omellia much,
why none do seek and sue
To match with thee: what is the cause
I now will tell thee true:
If any man Omellia,
should match and link with thee:
Thy husbands mother, not his wife,
thou would reputed be.
A Jest of a certain harebraind husband.
A Certain husband wild did hate his wife:
And vsd to coil her coat, with ^udgill rife.
One said to him, beat not thy wife so sore:
Then bumping blows good words will do much mo^^
Now after this, ye husband harebraind beast,
With Bible book still bounst her on the breast:
They say good word wildo much good said he:
If good, good words will do: tha^ here they be.
Against Hugo.
HVgo does laud no man at all,
nor no man loves he:
He thinks, others to d^ praise,
the chefest praise to be.
What gets he now by hatyng thus?
all men him hate indeed:
And boys call Hugo black, and say
of Hugo black take heed.
Of a Fool that found a Crab-fish.
BY fortune once in summer time,
when sun did frye and flame,
From native brook (where he was bred)
a crab fish crawling came.
And while he friskyng played on bank,
gay glisteryng green with grass:
He was up taken, by a man,
that there by him did pass.
This wight that found him was a fool,
and had no crabfish seen:
Wherefore he thrust his hand in haste,
his claspyng claws between.
The crab did pinch and pearce him sore,
wherefore he cast him quick
Into the flood: and said withal,
I Will teach you sir to prick.
The crab peart flappeth fast his tail
and in the waves does spring:
See said the fool, the plucking pangs
of death how sore they sting.
A Jest of a Thief.
A Certain Thief found guilty, both
of theft and perjury:
Was iudgd to have his tongue cut out
with knife, most cruelly.
Oh, said the thief unto the Judge,
your pointed purpose stay:
Oh, save my tongue, with caruyng knife
and cut mine ears away.
Two ears for one tongue I will lose:
well, quoth the Judge, agreed:
And sent for executioner,
to cut his ears with speed.
Now when the executioner came,
his hat from head he threw:
And hears there did appear, but ears
he there had none to view:
(For he had lost his ears before)
each laughed to see his wile:
And having thus decevd the Judge
the thief himself began smile.
CYNTHIVS IOANNES BAPTISTA.
To Diana Ariosta.
IN browe, in breast, in beauty brave,
in skill, and noble name:
Chaste Cynthia thou resemblest right
Diana, peerlesse Dame.
In this alone ye are not like,
hearts wild she killed still:
Hearts mild thou kilst: she killed with bow,
with look but thou do kill.
Of Niobe.
YE ^^^^^^unt brutes be packyng hence,
a^^^^che ye pensive wights:
And mourn with me whom sorrow fell,
torments both days and nights.
Brattes 7. and 7 by me were borne,
and brought into the light:
Of 7. and 7. (ah wretch) again
the Gods have refte me quight.
I melted into tears, and now
transformde to Marble stone:
I drop forth tears: so as in life
I mourn, now life is gone.
Learn here ye mortalles all, what it is
with stroutyng pride to swell:
And what likewise, for to despise
the Gods, in heaven that dwell.
Of his strange love.
IN fire I freeze, in Froste I fry:
How so, would know? a lover I.
To Renata, a noble Dame.
FOr princely pomp, and riches great,
queen Juno bears the bell:
Pallas for skill: for purity
Diana does excel.
For beauty brave does Venus pass:
Renata learned well,
Rich, chaste, of beauty brave beside,
all four does far excel.
Vesbia.
THree Furies (here to fore)
have always been in hell:
But now that Vesbia she is there,
there furies four do dwell.
TEXTOR.
Prayers for the ded, nothing profit.
THou sowest ^n sa^de, thou ploust ye plash,
thou anglest in the air:
If so thou go about to help,
the soul deceast by prayer.
An Epitaphe.
I Laughed, I weep I was, but now
I nothing am become:
I played, but now I cease to play:
I sang, but now am domme.
I wakt, I sleep: I studied once,
but lo I now am still:
My flesh I fed and pampred once,
but now the worms I fill:
I welcomde all sometime, but now
to all I bid adue:
I caught, but now am caught my self:
now slain, which sometime slew.
Once faught I, now I peace enjoy:
I life enjoyed all right,
Of right again I must therefore
yield unto Mors his might:
I yield, and yield I must of force:
earth was I once certain,
Earth, duste, and now at last I am
earth, duste, become again.
Earth, duste, now naught at all: wherefore
world vain adue to thee:
And since I needs must hence away,
worms welcome you to me.
To his Friend.
THou wont wast often to demand,
when we should foes become:
And when the knot of friendship should,
between us be undone.
Can Flint or Marble hard be made,
as yeldyng Butter soft?
Or can the lumpishe Ox be made,
to mount and soar alofte?
Can Woulues and Lambs agree? or can
the scrawlyng Crab crepe right?
Or can the Night, as gladsome Day
become so clear and bright?
Can Catte forbear to catch the Mouse?
can Hen and Kite agree?
Can Day be dark? or can the Night
as clear Aurora be?
Can Crows be made both fair and white,
and Swannes both foul and black?
Can cold congeled Ice, be hot?
can Winter coldness lack?
Can Fire then Water be more cold?
or can the Hare, delight
To play and dally with the Dog?
can ought be empty quight?
Can Wind from blowyng be restrainde?
can surgyng Seas be still?
Can flotyng Fish forsake the foorde?
can Death leave of to kill?
Can Fox and Hen, both in a Pen
agree together well?
Can peace abide with butteryng blows?
can love with discord dwell?
Can seas be waterles and dry?
can hills be dales without?
Can woods be void of trees? or skies,
deuoid of stars throughout?
Can one lone Emot drink the seas?
can God be from an hie?
Can God have ever any end?
can mortalles shun to die?
Can ragged rocks be precious stones?
can Iron Gold excel?
Can drowsy drunkenness esteem,
sage sober manners well?
Can fame be hushed and silence keep:
can drabs their tattle cease?
Can Venus vicious vile be chaste,
and leave, her beastlines?
When thou can bring these things to pass,
each one both more and less:
Or see them to be brought to pass,
then shall our friendship cease.
To the Pope.
IF that thou will not save thy flock,
from wolves devouring throat:
At least be not a wolf thy self,
clad in a sheepskin coat.
To spiritual pastors.
AS pastor pure, preserve thy flock,
have Argus eyes to watch:
Lest that the feend the woulfe of hell,
do thee and thine dispatche.
Thou oughtst their wool and fleese to shere:
to shere, but not to shave:
Have Argus eyes I say again,
thy flock to shield and save.
No meruell now, though sickly sheep,
and sore deseasd we see:
For who as nowadaies (God knows)
but wolves their keepers be.
A woman.
A Woman fawnes, and does entrap,
a woman wageth war:
She guiles* the body she does blind,
the members she does mar.
She febles force, she draws a man,
she burns up the bones:
She fawnes, gives, asks, she likes, she lothes
she merry makes, she mones.
She wastes wealth, though purse be stuffed,
she crosses makes the same:
She fights, she throws down mighty walls,
strong Castelles she does tame.
She posies bears: she glasses has:
as pert as any Pie:
She smelles, she kisseth, and her corpse
she loves excedyngly.
She tufts her hear* she frotes her face,
she idle loves to be:
She mincyng iets: to virtue slow,
but prone to vice is she.
How to get friendship.
Give much, but little ask again,
take heed thou nothing take:
If much thou give, and little ask,
if guiftes thou do forsake
Among the common people thou,
shall bear away the bell:
And thick and threefold friends will flock,
with thee to bide and dwell.
But if thou nothing give at all,
then friends will from thee fly:
If much thou ask, then shall thou be
repulsed by and by.
If much thou take, then covetous
and carle they will thee call:
Take naught, ask little, part from much,
and friends have sure ye shall.
The properties of certain birds. Of the Peacok.
WHen Argus with his hundred eyes,
Hermes had conquered q^^ght
By sweet melodyous harmony,
and Musyckes heavenly might.
Then Juno took his watchful eyes,
and bravely by and by,
She plast them in my train, where now
they shine as sun in sky.
My name hights Peacocke commonly,
I take a great delight
In setting up my plumes alofte,
that bravely glister bright.
I haunt where princely buildings be,
I loath the Cottage base:
I have a fearful feendlike note,
a theuish softly pace.
My flesh as hard as hard may be,
from Samos I Will I came:
Juno does me defend and keep,
and Iunos byrd I am.
The Eagle.
FRom all the flock of fliyng fowls
I bear away the bell:
I mount up to the clusteryng clouds,
I fear no lightnyngs fell.
Jove's jolly armiger am I,
as Poets pens have told:
Among all fethered fowls am I,
the goodliest to behold.
Gay gallaunt golden Ganimed,
(in tallents clinched fast)
I carried unto Jove on hye,
of whom he was embrast.
No byrd, no foul there is, that dare
compare with me to fly:
The Eagle only servant is,
to thundryng Jove on hie.
The Swanne.
A Swanne my name does hight:
from foreign cost I came:
Dame Venus Chariot I derect,
and Venus bird I am.
Among the Gods I am belovde,
like Siren sweet I sing:
I joy to chaunt, before I feel
of Death the dreadful styng.
The Voulter.
I Called am the Voulter black:
I clawe mine enemy
With crooked cruel cratchyng claws:
a filthy foul am I.
My food is fulsome carrion foul,
with every carkas dedde
That tumbled lies in stinkyng ditche,
I love for to be fed.
With every writers pen pursued,
dispraised still am I:
The foulest foul I counted am,
of all the fowls that fly.
Yet for the sense of smellyng sure,
no foul surpass me can:
The Lion, Libarde, Egle, I
surmount, and also man.
The Partridge.
Among all other birds,
most mestfull bird am I:
Among all fethered fowls,
I first complain and cry.
All in the night both g^^nes and snares,
are laid poor soul for me:
Man spares no pain, but labors still
that I may taken be,
Would know the cause why I am sought,
of every Fouler sly?
The cause is this, among all birds,
the finest flesh have I.
Thou see the crafty carren Crow,
Is never cared for:
Because his flesh is fulsome vile,
all men do him abhor.
But I am soft and delicate,
and therefore me they get*
And for a princely dishe am I,
before great princes set.
The Sparrowe.
THe fethered Sparrowe ca^d am I,
in swet^ and plaasaunt spryng
I greatly do delight, for then
I chitter, chirpe, and sing.
I take delight in garnisht groves
to seek my living still:
And though but little bird I am,
yet sing I sweet and shrill.
Now thou that great and mighty art,
despise and set not light
By little ones: small ones oftymes
subdue the great of might.
NICOLAVS BARTHOLOMAEVS LOCHIENSIS.
Of a dronkard going home from the Tavern.
A Drunkarde drinkyng all the day,
At night did homward take his way:
The drink his bladder burdened so,
That he must let his water go.
Thereby he leande him to the wall,
By chance a shower as then did fall:
He thoroughly drunk, and tipled well,
Did deem he piste the rain that ^elt:
His mate that with him then did go,
(Much musyng why he tarried so)
Asked him toth wall he did cleave.
And said, wilt never pissyng leave?
(Quoth he) so long as God shall please,
I here must piss, and take mine ease.
To one having a very red nose.
IF thou did plie the pot no more,
then thou do plye thy book:
Then would not nose of thine so read
and fiery flaming look.
HIERONYMVS BALBVS.
To Guido.
IN sign of trusty friendship true,
my Guido trusty friend:
Both Verses fine, and apples fine,
unto us thou did send.
As apples fine delight the mouth,
so Verses please the mind:
The first in taste, the second graeft,
most pleasant we did find.
Thy apples pass the glisteryng gold*
thy Verses pearls excel:
Thy gifts from either gold, or pearl,
quight bear away the bell.
Not better apples then were thine,
might king Alcinous send:
And Verses thine so excellent,
God Clarius might not mende.
To Marianus.
THou enemy to muses nine,
thou foe to learned dames:
How dare thou Poets pure despise,
and seek to foil their fames?
Orpheus Poet excellent,
with song and sugared voice:
Could tame the hellishe hounde, and make
both stones and beasts rejoice.
Arion fingeryng fine his Harp,
with cunnyng skillful hand:
Was by a Dolphin saved from seas,
and brought unto the land.
Amphion by his eloquence
and sugared speeches mild:
Brought to a ciuell form of life,
rude barbarous people wild.
Now if so thou proceed and speak,
against Poets that excel:
More hard art thou then ragged stones,
and beasts in woods that dwell.
ERASMUS IN HIS CHILIADES.
Of a sheep that fostered a woolfe.
WIth milk of mine I fed a woolfe,
not of mine own accord,
(But thereto forced:) for woolues you know,
of sheep are still abhord.
When I had brought him life, at last
my life he reft from me:
Lo, for no gifts nor benifites,
may nature changed be.
Again of the same.
WIth milk of mine own, a woolfe I did feed,
compelled thereto of my sheppard indeed:
When long I had fed him, by him I was spilt,
lo naught will be naught, say and do what you wilt.
Best never to be borne.
WHat path list you to tread?
what trade will you assay?
The courts of plea by braull and bate,
drive gentle peace away.
In house for wife and child,
there is but carke and care:
With toil and travel enough,
in feeldes we use to fare.
Upon the Seas lies dread:
the rich in foreign land
Do fear the loss, and there the poor
like misers poorly stand.
Strife with a wife, without
your thrift full hard to see:
Young brats a trouble, none at all
a mayme it seems to be.
Youth fond, age has no heart,
and pincheth all to nigh:
Choose then the leifer of these two
no life, or sone to dye.
Metrodorus mind to the contrary.
WHat race of life run you?
what trade will you assay?
In Court is glory got, and wit
increases day by day.
At home we take our ease,
and beak our selves in rest:
The feilds our nature does refresh
with pleasures of the best.
On seas great gain is got:
the stranger, he shall be
Esteemed having much, if not
none knows his lack but he.
A wife will trim thy house,
no wife then art thou free:
Brood is a lovely thing, without
thy life is loose to thee.
Young blods be strong, old syres
in double honor dwell:
Do way the choice, no life, or soon
to die, for all is well.
STROZA.
Of Scaurus, a rich man and covetous.
SCaurus has sundry villages,
rich farms and manners brave:
Much land, fat Oxen, store of coin:
he has what he can have.
Yet still he scrapes with tooth and nail,
more, still he does desire:
With carkyng caryng covetousness,
his mind is set on fire.
Fabritius better lives then he,
a poor contented wight:
Whom nether greedy gatheryng,
nor usury does delight.
ANTONIUS MVRETVS.
Against Venus.
IF Venus, (as the liyng route
of bablyng Poets sing)
If she out of the surgyng seas
and weltring waves did spring.
How can this come to pass, that she
should burn that so was borne?
By flanckeryng flame of fiery love,
to cinders men are worn.
Ah, gripyng grief: what hopst thou for
poor Lover seely wretch?
Thou from the midst of flowyng streams,
hot scaldyng fire do fetch.
To Margaris.
WHen so it raines, and Phoebus rays
are covered all with clouds:
Then every thing remainyng sad,
in silence pensive shroudes.
Therefore muse not my Margaris,
though sad thou do me see:
Behold mine eyes rain tears, and thou
my son art gone from me.
To Corellius.
A Baker, Butcher and a Baude,
a Cobbler and a Cook,
Thou art: a Merchant, Lawier to
well skilled in thy book.
All these Corellius though thou be,
yet poor thou art perdy:
And none in all the city lives,
like thee in misery.
How can this be be Corellius?
I muse and marvel to,
When as thou can so many things,
Yet nothing can thou do.
Of Pontilianus.
WHen flaming Phoebus with his heat,
does cause the ground to chinke,
Straight ways Pontilian thirsty cries,
boy hither hie with drink.
When so it raines, lo now says he,
God warnes us to carowse:
Which all about the ground does so
with sleet and showers souse.
So gullyng thus, in sun nor showers
his drink is not forgot:
And somewhat still he has to say,
why he should toss the pot.
AVSONIVS.
An exhortation unto modesty.
MEn say, that King Agathocles
once fed in potters plate:
And charged often with Samian claie,
his Tables where he sat.
Mong which his chargers all of Gold,
he served in would see:
And so together he would minge,
his pride and pouertee.
Whereof this cause he gave. Lo I
possessyng princely place
Of Cicil: late was son unto
a Potter poor and base.
Learn hence your rooms to reverence ye
that clime to honor fast,
And beggar brought to honors seat,
remember what thou wast.
Of the Picture of Rufus, a vain Rhethorician.
THe Rhethoricians statue this,
that Rufus had to name:
Look even what Rufus was himself,
this Image is the same.
Tongles and witles, cold and deaf,
a stone that can not see:
A Rufus right: one difference yet,
more soft was Rufus he.
Of a woman that would have poisoned her husband.
A Wife, a wicked woman that
a noughtie life did live,
Unto her jealous husband did
foul filthy poison give.
She demyng that alone, not of
sufficient force to be
To rid him quickly: longing sore
his quick dispatche to see,
Quickesiluer with the poison mings,
demyng of both the force,
Would quickly bring him to his grave,
and make him soon a corse.
These parted, poison strong do make,
(What man the same would think)
But put together they preserve,
Who so thereof does drink.
Now while together twixt themselves,
these poisons both do strive:
He voyds from him the deadly bane,
and so remains alive:
What care hoth God on earthly souls?
he dead reuiueth man.
And when the fates will have it so,
two poisons proffit can.
To one that painted Echo.
THou wiltles wight, what means this mad intent,
To draw my face and form, unknown to thee?
What meanst thou so for to molesten me?
Whom never eye beheld, nor man could see.
Daughter to talkyng tongue, and air am I,
My mother nothing is when things are wayde,
I am a voice without the bodies aid.
When all the tale is told and sentence said,
Then I recite the latter end afreshe,
In mockyng sort and counterfayting wise:
Within your ears my chefest harbor lies,
There do I won, not seen with mortal eyes.
And more to tell and farther to proceed,
I Echo hight of men below in ground:
If thou will draw my counterfeit indeed,
Then must thou paint (O Painter) but a sound.
An Epitaphe of Anitia.
THe things that many years,
can scantly bring about,
Anitia has accomplished, yet
not fully twenty out.
An infant she has sucked, a maid
she quickly fell in love:
She linkt, conceiude, brought forth, and did
the pangs of child-birthe prove,
And made a mother, now at last,
death hence did her remove.
Who rightly can the fates accuse?
she lived has the years,
Each ages function to perform,
as plain by proof apperes.
Of a Hare taken by a Dog-fishe.
THe sentyng hounds pursude,
the hasty Hare of foot:
The selie beast to escape the Dogs,
did iumpe upon a root:
The rotten scrag it burste,
from cliffe to Seas he fell:
Then cride the Hare, unhappy me,
for now perceive I well
Both land and sea pursue,
and hate the hurtlesse Hare:
And eke the dogged sky alofte,
if so the dog be theare.
Of Miron an old dottrell, that would have lain with Lais.
OLd Mi^on, Lais wanton wenche
to lie with him, besought:
Fine Lais she, did put him back
and set his suit at naught.
He knowing sure it was his age,
that she did so despise:
His hoarie head (all over straght)
with blackyng dark he dies.
And so with wonted visage he,
but not with wonted hear
For to renew his wonted suit,
goes to his Lays dear.
But she comparyng head of his
and face together well:
Perchance this same is Miron mine
quoth she: I can not tell.
So she (uncertain what he was)
disposde to sport and play:
In daliyng wise thus began she speak
and to her lover say:
Why foolish fellow fond quoth she,
why do thou this require?
The thing thou do demand of me,
I erst denied thy sire.
Translated out of two Greek authors: Plato and Scatilius.
A Wretched caitiffe, in despair.
went forth with throtlyng cord
To make away himself: by hap
he found a golden hoarde:
He joyful it was his happy chance,
this hidden hoarde to find:
Forsook his purpose, took the gold
and left the rope behind.
The owner when he came, and saw
from thence his ruddocks refte:
For sorrow hunge him self with rope,
that there behind was left.
Of Venus in armor.
DAme Pallas Lady Venus vewde,
clad brave in armor bright:
Let Paris judge (come on quoth she)
together let us fight.
See, see, quoth Venus how she brags:
a proud disdainful dame:
Thou know I smocklesse conquered thee,
peace Pallas, fie for shame.
The same otherwise.
IN complete Pallas saw,
the Lady Venus stand:
Who said, let Paris now be Judge,
encounter we with hand.
Replide the Goddess: what?
skornste thou in armor me:
That naked erst in Ida mount,
so foild and conquered thee?
Of the picture of Rufus a vain Rhethoritian, of whom there is an Epigram
before.
THis Rufe his Table is,
can nothing be more true:
If Rufus hold his peace, this piece
and he are one to vewe.
Of the picture of the same Rufus.
WIth visage fair, that can not speak,
would know what one I am?
I Marry: I am Rufus he
the Rhethoritian.
What, can not Rufus speak him self?
he can not: tell me why?
The Image of this Image, for
he is him self perdie.
Of the Table wherein Rufus was painted.
THe portrature of Rufe this is,
which here you see:
Much like the same in deed: him self
but where is he?
Him self in stately chair is plast:
what does he there?
Naught else but what you see him do
in Table here.
Of the picture of king Craesus, translated out of the first book of Greek
Epigrams.
THy picture Craesus king that did
for riches all excel:
Uncivil rude Diogines
beheld beneth in hell.
And vewyng it aloof, he laughed
as though his heart would break:
At last (when he had laughed his fill,)
he thus began to speak.
O foolish Craesus, what auailes
now all thy paultrie pelf?
Since now thou poorer art, then poor
Diogines him self.
For what was mine I bare with me,
when selie Craesus poor
Thou penilesse did pack from hence,
for all thy hugy store.
Of the drink DODRA: Which is made of nine things.
I Dodra hight: How so? nine things
do go to making mine:
Which they? joyce, water, honey bread,
spice, herbs, salt, oil and wine.
Against two sisters of diverse conditions.
WE muse and marvel Delia much,
(and that with cause) to see
That there such difference is betwixt,
thy sister she and thee.
She chaste does seem (unchaste indeed)
because of her araie:
Thou chaste indeed, do seem unchaste,
for garments thine so gay.
Though thou be spotles pure in life,
thoug she have honest weeds:
Yet garments thine dishonest thee,
and her her noughtie deeds.
Of a sluggard.
THe luske in health is worser far,
then he that keeps his bed:
It Is twice so much that he deuoures
of bear, of beafe and bread.
Of the rich and poor man.
HE is not rich which plenty does posces:
Ne is he poor, that nothing has at all:
And of them both the poorema^s need is less,
as by the sequel proved see you shall.
The rich of Precious stones does stand in need:
the poor of grain to help him in distres:
So since the poor and rich both want, indeed
of both their needs yt porema^s need is less.
Of his dear deceased.
THree graces fair there were: but while
my Lesbia did remain
Four were there: and now she is gone,
there are but three again.
MICHAEL TARCHAMOTA MARVLLVS.
To Neaera.
MY sweet, you ask what life I live:
Even such a life as you me give,
Distressed, doleful, barde from rest,
As bad as well can be expreste:
This is the life for certaintee,
That you my dear do give to me.
You do demand my dear beside,
What mates a days with me abide:
Cares, sickness pale, and greef of heart,
Pain, twitching throws, and scalding smart,
Sighs, sobbes, and tears, and great unrest,
As bad, as well can be expressed.
Companions these and mates of mine,
These you my dear to me assine.
ANDREAS DACTIVS.
Of him self, and his friend.
LIke as the bough does bud and branche*
knit to his body fast:
And plucked away, does sone decaie,
dry, wither, dye and waste.
Even so by thee I stand, or fall,
I live or dye by thee:
For unto thee I am the bough,
and thou the stock to me.
IOANNIS BAPTISTA PIGNA.
Of Naijs.
WHen as the Sun does shine,
if Naijs hide her face:
Then Phoebus dies, and all the feelds
lament in doleful case.
When as the Sun does shroude,
if Naijs fair appear,
Then darkness dies, and all the feelds
rejoice with gladsome chere.
CAELIVS RHODIGINVS.
How a man should prepare to dye.
GOod end if thou desire, then well
to live thy self apply:
A happy life if thou desire,
remember still to die.
Piscarius his Epitaphe.
WHo under this same Marble cold,
engraued lies express?
A Fisher great, in war a Mars,
and one that loved peace.
What caught he fish declare me? no.
what then I pray thee tell?
Towns, cities, kingdoms, kings themselves
haught, stout, that did excel.
How caught this Fisher these, declare
by what devised netts?
By counsel deep, by courage great,
by strength that all things getts.
Who conquered this stout Duke at last?
Mars, Mors, two Gods of might:
What was the cause that them constrainde?
vile envious hellishe spite.
They hurt him naught, for still does live
his fame and glory bright:
Which is of force, both Mars and Mors,
and all to put to flight.
GEORGIUS SABINVS.
Of the discord of Princes.
TWo thrushes fallen at variaunce
together feirce do fight:
Each seeks the other for to foil
by struggling, strength, and might.
The Hawke (their cruel enemy)
beholding them at square:
In cruel clutches caught them both
and them to peaces tare.
So christian princes while they be
between themselves at bate,
In comes the tyrant Turk, their fo,
and spoils them of their state.
To a Less, lamentyng of her mother the loss.
IN wayling the departure, of
thy loving mother dear:
In ragyng sort why do thou rend
and hale from head thine hear?
O spare thy locks (thou lewd)
and cease to pull thy pace:
Do think by baldnes pilde,
thy dolor to abate?
Of a Painter: A pleasant and merry jest.
A Painter once (that was
a Zeuxis for his skill)
Had children foul, deformed, black
and of complexion ill.
His wife spoke to him thus in sport,
upon a certain time:
Why do thou plant so naughtly tell,
and paint so fair and fine?
O wife (quoth he) you know I plant
in darkness all the night:
But paint I do when Phoebus rays
do cast a radiant light.
A merry jest of a scattergood.
WHat time a certain skattergood,
within his gates by night
Did entryng see a pilfring knave,
somethyng to steal and pike.
Thou art besnerd here in the night,
to look for ought (quoth he)
For I my self when Phoebus bright
does shine, can nothing see.
A Jest of a Iester.
A Scoffer fine was wont sometime,
in jest to every wight:
Still to rehearse Menalcas verse,
(of whom does Maro write.)
I Will make that none with talkyng tongue,
henceforth thou shall abuse:
This verse of Vergil still in sport,
and Iestyng he would use.
But so it chanced at the last,
for many a knauishe part:
He was compeld by throtlyng cord,
of death to bide the smart.
And brought to place where he should bide,
the pinching pangs of death:
The halter tide, the hangman horst
prepared to stop his breath.
The hangman puttyng ore his head,
the halter as they use:
Said: I Will make that none by talkyng tongue
henceforth thou shall abuse.
ANGERIANVS.
To the Rose.
THou Rose so fair do quickly fade,
so form fades quickly sure:
Then thou fair Rose, and beauty brave
a like time do endure.
To his Image.
MY portrature so lively wrought,
tell me who fashioned thee?
How passing right resemblest thou,
the countenance of me.
Thou look pale, pale eke look I:
thou blind, I also blind:
(Aye me) no mind have thou at all,
I likewise have no mind.
No life have thou, no life have I:
thou dumb can nothing speak,
(Aye me) my tongue ne talks at all,
I dumb and speachlesse eake.
No heart does harber in thy breast,
I hartlesse am again:
Thou bidest unaccompanied,
so likewise I remain:
Of fadyng paper thou compacte,
that quickly does decaie:
My body eke but brittle bark,
unsteadfast still does stay.
Thou as a shadow of my corpse,
enduerst but little time:
A fadyng shadow follows still
likewise the corpse of mine.
Thou feeble, sone do fade and fail:
long may not I remain:
To duste and powder thou must pack,
and so must I again.
Both like as like may be, but thou
livst merrier far then I:
Thou livst and lovste not, love makes me
a wretch to live perdie.
Of his love Caelia.
THe fire does tame the iron hard,
hard flinte the waters pearce:
Warm blood does break the Adamant,
as sundry books rehearse:
But she whom I do serve (more hard:
then these repeted three)
Then Iron, Flint, or Adamant,
more rockie hard is she.
For ne my fire that burns in breast,
ne tears from eyes that fall,
Nor spinnyng blood from sanguine veins,
may make her rue her thrall.
Of Jove.
A Swanne, a Bull, a Satyr wood,
and gold, was Jove above:
For L for E. for A. and D.
with whom he was in love.
To the Reader.
ALthough not thee, I please my self,
thou reader may be gone:
Sufficient if the writers works,
do please him self alone.
Of him self.
THou laughst, thou lowrst (both glad and sad)
thou both do rest, and raynge:
Such is the life a lover leads,
thou lovste, it is nothing straynge.
IOANNES SECVNDVS.
Three Evils.
Which are three ills that mischefe men,
to know do thou desire?
Have here in few my friend expressed,
the Fem, the Flud, the Fire.
The rich old man, of him self.
WHen young I was, then poor I was*
now in my latter days,
With riches I abound: (ay me)
unhappy wretch both ways.
When as I knew some use of goods,
I wanted evermore:
And now I know no use of goods,
of goods I have great store.
Of a Dwarf.
A Dwarf upon a Pismyers back
did get him up to ride:
He deemd a tamed Oliphante
he did as then bestride.
But while he did advance him self
to bold upon his back,
He tumbled down, and had a fall
that made his guts cry quacke.
When as the Dwarf was thus unhorsed,
each laughed, both great and small:
Why laugh you masters quoth the dwarf?
what? Phaeton had a fall.
Love is incurable.
AN herb is found each hurt to help:
all soars have salues we see:
Alone the wound that Cupid gives
can never cured be.
SIMON VALLAMBERTVS AVALON.
To a covetous old Carle.
ALthough thy horie silver hears,
as white as Lillies show:
Although thou Pylius pass in years,
that lived long ago:
Although ye teeth (which thou have bought)
nor crust can eat nor crumme:
Although unto the brinke thou art
of Stygian boat now come:
Yet naytheles whole Coffers cramd
with coin, thou still do crave:
And bags byg bolne with money much
thou still desirst to have.
O dotyng sire, these heaps of coin
requires not Charon fell:
One silly penny for his fare
contenteth Charon well.
Of Codrus.
INto a princely Palace proud
(built brave with Marble stone)
With ragged tattered torn attire
poor Codrus would have gonne.
So nakt (quoth one) ye come not here:
quoth Codrus no, and why?
The gods are nakt, and none but nakt
must go to heaven perdie.
To Pansophus.
THough Pansophus thou please none
no marvel it is, and why?
Thou please overmuch thy self
proud Pansophus perdy.
To a Niggarde.
ALL thing is dear thou say,
wine, vittayl, corn, and grain:
Yet miser vile well stored thou
with all thing do remain.
So thou to no man dear,
selst dear unto the poor:
Alack thou say all things are dear,
dear must I sell therefore.
Ah, sell thou miser as thou may
and shun thou Usury:
Charus.
So shall thou be to all men dear
Carus.
and dear to none perdie.
To a backbiter that was balde.
BAldsconse, I nothing have
unto thee for to say:
But sure I laud thy locks which are
gone from thy head away.
To Achilles Combanus.
BRight Glory rayngyng here and there,
to seek the shinyng bower
Where Virtue dwelt, hapt on thy house,
of Virtue fragrant flower.
And so when Glory did perceive,
that Virtue dwelt with thee:
Here will I rest (quoth he) thy guest,
I will Combanus be.

Our life were vain, and none for to

Leave to the world and thee an heir,
and shun adultery.
Of a Thracian lad.
A Thracian boy well tipled all the day,

A proverb.
Between thy upper lip,
and of the cup the brinke:
Do many things fall out,
the which thou would not think.
How death is hastened.
Whosoever he be that lothyng life,
desires soon to die:
Three things must follow (which are these)
Baines, wine, and Venerie,
Three things both hurt and help.
BAines, women, wine: these three
do shorten life certain:
Baines, women, wine: these three
do lengthen life again.
Nothing hid from God.
THou Caitiffe though thou do conceal,
thy crimes from men below:
Yet them to God thou must reveal,
whether thou will or no.
Feigned friendship.
NOt he so much annoyes and hurtes
that says I am thy foe:
As he that bears a hateful heart,
and is a friend to show.
Warnde of my foe, I shun my foe:
but how should I take heed
Of him that faines himself my friend,
when as he hates in deed?
Most sure a wretched foe is he,
which friendship firm does feign:
And sekes by all the shifts he can,
his friend to put to pain.
To much brynges lothsomnesse.
TO much of any thing is naught:
yea always prove you shall

for fish that there did swim:
A rich man's daughter him beheld,
and fell in love with him.
So that she linkt with him to live,
now he that was before
Base, barren, bare, and beggarlike,
does now abound with store.
Dame Fortue by smilyng began say,
I pray you which of us
Now mistres Venus (you or I)
was cause this happened thus.
Otherwise
WHile Fisher cast his line,
the houeryng fish to hook:
By hap a rich man's daughter on
the Fisher cast her look.
She fride with frantic love,
they married eke at last:
Thus Fisher was from low estate,
in top of treasure plast.
Stood Fortune by, and smilde:
how say you (dame) quoth she,
To Venus? was this conquest yours,
or is it due to me?
The seven sages names, sayings, and countries, in seven verses.
THe Cittyes 7. whereas the 7. wise masters rare
Were borne, their names, and saiyngs 7.7. verses shall declare.
Cleobulus of Lindia said, a mean does all excel.
Wise Pittacus of Mittelen, said, measure bears the bell.
Chilon of Lacedemon said, take heed thy self to know.
Of Corinth Periander said, to anger be thou slow.
Sage Solon the Athenian said, for ay respect the end.
Wise Thales of Milesium said, naught promise to thy friend.
Last, Bias of Priaenium said, all things to mischefe bend.
The report of the multitude not to be regarded.
SOlace and comfort thou thy self:
naught peoples talk esteem:
One man deemes well of thee, of thee
an other ill does deem.
Or thus.
SOlace and comfort thou thy self,
care naught what people prattle:
This man talks well with thee, that man
against thee still does tattle.
Of a fool.
THe friskyng flees yt feed on ^leshe by night,
a fool in bed, did trouble, twinge and bite:
The fool put out the candle: nay (quoth he)
I Will match ye, now no more you shall me see.
Of a foolish Astronomer.
WHile Thales looked round about,
to view the stars in sky,
He hedlong fell into a ditche:
and there did grouelyng lie.
A beldam coming after him
beheld him how he fell,
A country wife that went to fetch
fair water at a well.
When as she came unto the ditche
where lurden like he lay
She mocked him: and with tremblyng voice
she thus began to say.
Fie foolish fealow as thou art,
why do thou view the sky?
Why staarst on Stars that stately stand
and letst mean matters ^ye?
The fates of other men to show
I deem thee far unmeet,
When buzzard blind thou can not see
what is before thy feet.
When Women profit.
ALthough all women kind be naught,
yet two good days has she:
Her marriage day, and day of death
when all she leaves to thee.
Of Castors Nose.
WHen Castor diggs, a spade
his Nose is unto him:
A Trumpet when he sleeps:
a Sith and Sickletrim
When as he gathers grapes:
an Anchor when he sails:
A Culter when he plowes
that cuts and never fails:
When as he takes fish
a fishhooke all the while:
And when he would have flesh
his Nose a fleshhooke vile:
When as he graves in wood,
a grauyng knife: and when
He prunes and dresseth trees
a graffyng knife as then:
A chipaxe, look when as
the Carpenter he plays:
A passing picklock, when
to open locks he says.
And what so Castor does,
he can not miss his snoute:
His nose must be the tool,
his work to bring about.
Of a foul wife.
THe wretch that married has,
a dowd, an ougly dame:
Shall still have night, though day be bright,
and fiery Phoebus flame.
To one, having a long nose.
STand with thy snoute against the sun,
and open wide thy chaps:
And by thy teeth we shall decerne,
what it is a clock, perhaps.
Of a deaf Judge, a deaf plaintiff, and a deaf defendant.
BY hap a man that could not hear
that borne was deaf by kind,
Another cited to the court,
much like himself to find,
Whose hearing sense was quight bereft:
the Judge that of the case
Should give his verdit, was as deaf
as deafest in the place.
To court they came: the plaintiff praid
to have his unpaid rent:
Defendant said, in grindyng I
this werie night have spent.
The Judge beheld them both awhile,
is this (at last quoth he)
Of all your sturred strife the cause?
you both her children be.
And therefore her to help and aid
look that you both agree.
Of Marcus a sluggard.
MArcus a sluggard slepyng, dreamd
a long race that he rund:
For fear he so should dream again,
long after sleep he shund.
Against one very deformed.
TO paint the mind it is counted hard,
the corpse to paint it is light:
But now in thee so foul deformd,
it falls contrary quight.
For nature thine does plain bewraie,
the manners of thy mind:
And therefore how thy mind is bent,
but easy it is to find.
But now thy foul misshapen limbs,
how may they painted be?
And portraid out? when every man
does loath to look on thee.
Against a drunkerd.
WIth sweet perfumes, and flowers, my grave
do you not gratify:
Wine, fires, upon a stone to spend,
it is cost in vain perdie.
Alive give you me these, not dead:
with ashes wine to minge,
What is it mortar but to make,
not wine to me to bring.
Of drunkenness.
LIke men we still are meek, at night,
when we have typled well:
But when we rise at morn at hurst,
then are we fearce and fell.
Otherwise.
AT night when ale is in,
like friends we part to bed:
In morrow graie when ale is out,
then hatred is in head.
Again of the same.
MEn having quaft,
are friendly ouernight:
In dawning, dry,
A man to man a sprite.
Against a miser.
ALL call thee rich, I call thee poor,
goods make not rich perdie:
This prudent Apollophanes,
could tell as well as I.
If thou thy riches use thy self,
thy riches thine are then:
But if thou save them for thine heir,
they are for other men.
Of Chrisalus covetous.
Rich Chrisalus at point of death,
does mourn, complain and cry:
Was never man as he so loathe,
to leave his life and die.
Not for because he dies himself,
his death he does not force:
But that his grave must cost a grote,
to shroude his carrion corse.
Of a rich miser.
A Misers mind thou haste,
thou have a princes pelf:
Which makes thee wealthy to thine heir,
a beggar to thy self.
Of Aulus, Auarus.
Rich Aulus countyng what a charge,
his daughter was to him:
Did throw her in the sea, to see
where she could sincke or swim.
The same otherwise.
AVlus daughter twenty shillings charge,
each year was unto him:
He drownde her: asked wherefore:
he said she would undo him.
Of Asclepiades, a greedy carle.
ASclepiad that gredie carle,
by fortune found a Mouse:
(As he about his lodgyng looked)
within his niggishe house.
The chidyng chuffe began to chafe,
and (sparefull of his chere:)
Demanded of the selie beast,
and said, what makst thou here?
You need not stand in fear (good friend)
the smilyng Mouse replide:
I come not to devour your cates,
but in your house to bide.
A long beard makes not a Philosopher.
IF so a long down danglyng beard,
do make a prudent man:
The bearded beast that hights the Got,
may be a Plato than.
To one lame and loutishe.
THy lyms are lame, so is thy mind:
thy outward form bewraies
Thy properties, how inwardly
thou art disposde always.
Cassander his Epitaphe.
Since that a mortal borne thou art,
in danger still to die:
Account of naught as though thou should,
live here continually.
For all must pack: of slipperie life,
uncertain is the stay,
Death will us by the shoulders shake,
no help, we must obaye.
Cassander here lies refte of life,
fast grasped in his grave:
Yet for his wisdom he deservde,
for ever life to have.
Timocritus his Epitaphe.
TImocritus a warriar stout,
Lo, lies engraued here:
Mars spares not valiant champions stout,
But dastards that do fear.
Aristomenes.
THou messenger to Jove on high,
thou Egle swift of flight:
On Aristomenes his toumbe,
declare why do thou light?
By this I give to understand,
that as all birds I pass:
So he did all men far surmount,
while here a live he was.
The fearful Doves do haunt the toombes
which hartlesse dastards hide:
But where are buried champions bold,
I love for to abide.
Calimachus.
THe frounyng fates have taken hence
Calimachus, a child
Five years of age: ah well is he
from cruel care exilde:
What though he livd but little time,
wail naught for that at all:
For as his years not many were,
so were his troubles small.
Old age longed for, yet lothed.
Each one does seek and wish for age,
all while it is away:
And few do come for to be old,
which for old age do pray.
When age yet comes, each does ^t loathe,
and all do it detest:
So still we loathe our present state,
deming the absent best.
Death euerywhere.
HEre buried lies a Mariner:
and here a Corridon:
So on the sea, and one the land,
death riddeth, all is one.
It matters not where a man dye.
IT makes no matter where thou die:
the way to heaven on hie
From every country is a like,
be it far of, or nie.
Living on the Seas.
Shun thou the seas, which bread unease,
and quiet live on land:
If thou desire in happy health,
to florishe long and stand.
Long life the land does always lend,
the seas make short our years:
Upon the seas are seldom seen,
old men with hoarie hears.
Of Diogenes.
A Sachell and a staiyng staff,
an homely mantell: these
Were acceptable to the life,
of wise Diogenes.
Opinion.
Great force in things Opinion has,
thou courteous art in deed:
What then? if otherwise men think,
they surely will thee speed,
As once the men of Crete unkind,
did Philolaus slaie:
Because they falsely demde and thought,
he would the tyrant play.
Epictetus.
MY name did Epictetus hight,
a bonde-man borne was I:
In body lame, as Irus poor,
a friend to Gods on hie.
To Gabriel.
A Painter painted Phaeton,
he painted eke the Sun:
But no light could the Painter paint,
when all was made and done.
Like so renouned Gabriel,
a Painter painted trim
Thy face and visage, but thy mind
could not be made by him.
Myrons Cow.
THe Cow of brass that Myron made,
(by art and cunnyng skill)
If entrails she had had, she would
have loowde both loud and shrill.
Venus to Praxiteles.
King Priams son, Anchises eke,
with my Adonis dear
Beheld me nakt, these only three:
Praxiteles but where?
Of Venus in armor.
WHy have thou Venus tell,
God Mars his armor on?
Such boisterous stuff why do thou put,
thy tender corpse upon?
Mars mighty thou dydst conquer quight,
stark naked, stripped clean:
To come to men, thus armed then,
I muse what do thou mean.
Of Cinyras a Fisher.
Unto the Nymphs old Cinyras,
has dedicate his Net:
To beat the brooks and firke the fish,
old age now does him let.
Wherefore you fishes sport your selves,
and through the waters skimme:
For now that Cinyras is done,
you safe in seas may swim.
Biton.
BIton all underneath this tree,
three guiftes does offer here:
To Pan a Goat, flowees to the Nymphs,
to Bacchus God a spear.
Ye Gods accept them thankfully.
and make to prospere still
His cattle Pan, his waters Nymphs,
Bacchus his ground to till.
Of Alcon an Archer.
A Sire that Alcon hight,
beheld his son embrast
Of Serpent ready to be rent:
he took his bow in have,
And shot with cunnyng skill so strait,
that he the Serpent kilde:
And savde his selie child, which else
the scrawlyng Snake had spilde.
Thus when the Snake was slain, his son
eke saved from annoye:
He hunge his quiver on a bough,
reuivde with double joy.
Timon his Epitaphe.
MY wretched caitiffe days,
Expired now and past:
My carren corpse entered here,
Is graspt in ground:
In weltryng waves of swellyng
seas by sourges cast:
My name if thou desire,
the Gods thee do confound.
THEODORUS BEZA VEZELIVS.
An Epitaphe upon the death of William Budaeus, an excellent learned man of
our time, who died at Paris in France. Anno. M.D.XL.XII. Call. September.
BVaeVS only one alone,
(of wondrous art and skill)
Has made the earth, the heavens, and men
beholden to him still.
To haughty heavens he has bequethd
his soul: his corpse to ground:
And unto us he has bequethd
his worthy works profound.
So poor from hence he did depart,
for naught he left himself:
But better far this poverty
perdie, then wordly pelf,
An other Epitaphe of the same Budaeus.
ALL men bewaild Budaeus death,
the air did also moan:
The brawlyng brooks eke wept, because
Budaeus good was gone.
So men did wail, that every where,
were papers printed seen
Of Verses, Threnes and Epitaphes,
full fraught with tears of teene.
From air so dropped the rayny tears,
that shed was every shower:
So that no drop remaynd behind,
upon the earth to power.
So wept the waters, that whereas
before were Barges borne:
There now might whirling wagons run:
to dust the waves were worn.
Now heaven and earth remains behind,
these two alone except:
There nothing was in all the world,
but for Budaeus wept.
But since the heavens posses his soul,
(and still posses it shall)
The earth his corpse, what cause have they,
wherefore to weep at all?
An Epitaphe upon the death of Katharina Texea.
WHo lies lodged here below,
perchance thou reader feign would know:
And I my self would gladly tell,
but that her name I know not well.
And marvel none at all though I,
am thereof ignorant perdie:
For who most learned are of all,
wot not her name what they should call.
For if by corpse supposd may be
her seex, then sure a virgin she:
But sure I wot not ponderyng all,
how I woman may her call.
For why? nor fear, nor greef, could make
her sturdy stomach stout to quake.
She misbehavd her self in naught,
she freely spoke what so she thought.
And when that silence best beseemd,
then none then she more silent deemd.
She never she, held dancing dear:
she never decked nor tuft her here:
She never used paintyng dye:
she never vsd to role her eye:
No wanton word would she put out:
therefore she was a man no dout.
Yet sure she was no man I know,
I not why I should name her so.
Such heavenly hue such bewty brave,
we never saw yet man to have.
Both man and woman then was she:
nay that again may no ways be.
I have already proved this,
that she ne man nor woman is.
A goddess then neades must she be,
or else a new Mineru^ she:
And though she be a Lady bright,
yet has she heart and manly might.
Yet Pallas cruelty is known,
eak vice of gods abroad is blown.
Wherefore of force we must suppose,
that this same Tomb does here enclose
Such one as every state did stain:
men, women, gods aloft that reign.
Written upon the grave of ANTON. PRAT. (chief Chaunceler of FRANCE) which
was a gross great Gorbely.
A GREAT MAN here engraued lies.
Of Titus Liuius.
FOr Liuie late a Tomb I began ordain,
what meanest thou Apollo said, refrain:
Such manner things become the dead (que he)
but Liuie lives, and still alive shall be.
To Cl. Marotus.
APelles learned hand, so fine
did paint fair Venus Queen:
That every one susposd that he,
had Venus vewd and seen.
But works of thine Marotus lewd,
of Venus savor so:
That every one sure deemes, that thou
do all of Venus know.
A present to Truchius and Dampetrus.
Firm fast unfeigned faithful friends,
have vsd (and use always)
Each one the other to present
with gifts on Newyeares day.
A Custom Laudable it is,
at every newyeres tide
Old love with gifts for to renew,
that friendship fast may bide.
Now since my Truchius trusty true
thou takst me for thy friend:
And since my dear Dampetrus eke
his likyng me does Lend.
(According unto ancient guise)
I send unto you here
A present small: and what though small?
yet fit it shall appear.
You both are Poe^s: to you both
I verses send to view:
I verses send in token of
the love I bear to you.
Pure love has linkt you both in one,
and since you joined be:
One gift to send unto you both,
it seemed best to me.
Description of virtue.
WHat one art you thus in torn weed yclad?
Virtue, in price of ancient sages had:
Why poorly raid? for fadyng goods past care:
why doble faast? I mark each fortunes fare.
This bridle what? minds rages to restrain,
tools why beer you? I love to take great pain.
Why wings? I teach above ye stars to fly,
why tread you death? I only cannot dye.
Against a maidenly man.
FOr to be married yesterdaie,
To Church a gallaunt ietted gaie:
His crisped locks wavde all behind,
His tongue did lispe, his visage shinde.
His rouyng eyes rolde to and fro,
He fiskyng fine did mincyng go:
His lips all painted seemed sweet:
When as the Priest came them to meet,
(A pleasant scouse, though uought of life)
He asked of both which was the wife?
Of a Painter, and a Baker.
A Painter and a Baker strivde,
which should the other pass
To paint or bake, twixt them to judge*
A Priest ordained was.
The Painter spoke (quoth he) what so
the hugy world contains,
Or what so Nature works, is wrought
by Painters art and pains.
(Quoth Baker) this is more then that,
Christ which the world did frame
The Baker forms in figure fine,
that all may see the same.
Quoth Painter then, thou make Christ's,
men's bellies for to fill:
Thy Christ's are chrusht with crasshing teeth,
my work continues still.
Quoth Baker then, what thou do paint,
does no man good in deed:
What we do form it serves as food,
the hungry soul to feed.
Quoth Painter, Bakers bake their Gods,
men's bellies for to fill:
Quoth Baker Painters paint their Gods,
for Worms to gnawe and spill.
Then quoth the Judge, ho ho^la here,
sufficient for this time:
About this weighty thing to braule,
is sure an heinous crime.
Both to your houses now depart,
and still in peace agree:
And Painter paint, and Baker bake,
your gods to bring to me.
A sportfull comparison, between Poets and Papists.
LO here the cause to Francis, why
Homerus I compare:
Lo here the cause wherefore I think,
that Monks like Poets are.
Franciscus could not see one whit,
and Homer he was blind:
Homerus he was blind of sight,
Franciscus blind of mind.
Franciscus was a beggar bare,
no bigger Homer was:
Bare beggars both, their time they did
in merry syngyng pass.
Franciscus filde the world with lies,
lies likewise Homer taught:
Franciscus by his brethren,
Homer by books he wraught.
In secret woods and glomie groves,
first Poets led their lives:
In dampishe denues and deserts ded,
Monks livde without their wives.
Each town with Munkes was pestered,
when woods at last they left:
With Poets every city swarmde,
they could not thence be reft.
Still Poets sing: and moppinne Munkes,
sing likewise day and night:
And none so much as they them selves,
do in their songs delight.
Each Poet has his wanton wenche,
to dandle all the day:
For fear of failyng every Munke,
has four to keep him play.
The Poet lauds (and likes of life)
full cups which flow and swym:
The Munke if he his licker lack,
all goes not well with him.
The Poet with his luryng Lu^e,
his Sonets syngeth shrill:
The Monk with pot fast by his side,
his carroles chaunteth still.
With diverse Furies both are vexed:
the Poet bears a spear
With Iuie decked: the maskyng Munke
a golden cross does bear.
The Poets croune is dressed with Ba^es,
and mirttle branches brave:
White shinyng shitten shaven crounes,
the Popish prelates have.
For fine, to Munke give Poetry,
to Poet give the whood:
And so thou shall make both of them,
right Munkes, and Poets good.
Against stepdames.
A Striplyng went with scourge in hand,
Whereas the portrature did stand
Of stepdame his: in rage anon
He fell to beatyng of the stone.
The stone down on him tattereth,
And unto death him battereth:
Thou son in law take heed, and see
To stepdame thine, though dead she be.
An Epitaphe upon the death of Ihon Calvin, poorly and plainly enterred at
Geneua.
THe terror of the Romish route,
does lie engraued here:
Whose loss all good men wail, of whom
the wicked stood in fear.
Of whom even Virtue fair her self,
might virtue learn: now why
So grossly gravde do reader ask
does learned CALVIN lie?
While Calvin liude, dame Modesty
did him associate still:
And she her self here placed him,
when Death did Calvin kill.
O blessed grave that do enclose,
a guest so godly grave:
Thou do surpass the Marble toumbs
and kings sepulchers brave.
Again upon the death of Ihon Calvin
WHile Calvin thou did live, alive
I likewise lovd to be:
Ay me how I could like of life,
to leave now life with thee.
My life I loathe, and yet I love
to live, alone for this:
That I may weep and waill for thee,
whom I so sore do miss.
Ah Beza live to weep and wail,
to weep and wail at full
Caluinus Death, ah farewell friend,
Adue, now ded and dull.
Until in sweet Celestial cost,
we both shall meet again
In tears, in teen, in mourning moan,
shall doleful Beze remain.
Martino Luthero, antichristi Romani domitori Trophaeum.
ROme conquered all the world, and Rome
the Pope did conquer quight:
Rome conquered al by frollick force,
the Pope by subtle slight.
But Learned Luther Champion stout,
how far does he both twayn
Surmount, who with his seely pen
to yield does both constrain.
Now go to Greece, brag til thou burst
of stout Alcides thine:
Naught is his battering club, compard
to Luthers pen divine.
THOMAS MORVS.
Of an Astrologer, That was a Cuckold.
TO thee thou ayrie Prophet, all
the stars them selves do show:
And do declare what destinies,
al men shall have below.
But no stars (though they al things se)
admonish thee of this,
That thy wife does with every man,
behave her self amiss.
Saturnus stands far of, men say
that he long since was blind,
And scantly could decern a child
and from a stone him find.
Fair Luna goes with shamfast eye,
A virgin naught will see
But such things as beseme a maid,
and lightness all will flee.
Jove to Europa gave his heart:
To Mars did Venus cleave:
And Mars again did Venus serve:
Sol would not Daphne leave
His love: and Mercury did call
to mind his Hyrce deer:
Hereof it comes to pass, oh thou
unwise Astrologere,
That when thy wife delighted is
with lusty yonkers love:
Thereof do nothing notify
to thee the s^arres above.
Of Beuty. Dilemma.
IN faith what beutie brave auailes,
at all I nothing see:
If thou be fervent, hot, each doud
seems fair and fresh to thee:
If thou be out of courage, cold,
the loueliest lothsum be:
In faith what bewty brave auailes,
at all I nothing see.
Against Wiuyng.
A Misery to marry still,
thus every one does say:
Thus say they stll, yet wittingly
we wiuyng see each day.
Yea though one bury six, yet he
from wiuyng will not stay,
Again of wives.
GReefes grievous wives are unto men,
yet gladsome shall we find them
And loving: if so leuyng us,
they leave their goods behind them.
Of a Picture lively described.
SO well this table does express,
the countenance of thee:
As sure it seems no table, but
a glass thy self to see.
O^ a Niggard departing this life.
RIch Chrysalus at point of death,
does morn, complain and cry:
Was never man as he so loath
to leave his life and dye.
Not for because he dies, he cries,
his death he does not force:
This cuttes, his grave must cost a groate.
to shrowde his carrin corse.
The difference between a King and a Tyrant.
Between a Tyrant and a King,
would you the difference have?
The King each Subject counts his child*
the Tyrant each his slave.
A Tyrant in sleep, naught differs from a common person.
Do therefore swell and powt with pride*
and rear thy snout on hie:
Because the crowd does crouch and couch,
wherso thou come by?
Because the people bonnetles
before thee still do stand?
Because the life and death does lie
of diverse in thy hand?
But when that drousie sleep of thee,
has every part possessed:
Tell then where is thy pomp and pride,
thy port and all the rest?
Then snortyng lozzell as thou art,
then lie thou like a block:
Or as a carrion corpse late dead,
as senseless as a stock.
And if it were not that thou were,
closd up in walls of stone
And fenced round, thy life would be
in hands of every one.
Of a good Prince and an evil.
A Good prince what? the dog that keeps
his flock aye safe in rest,
And hunts the Wolf away: an ill?
him self the rauenyng beast.
Of a Thief and a Lawier.
A Thief ycleped Clepticus,
that did from one purloine:
Fearyng to be condemde, a pace
his Lawier fed with coin.
When Lawier his had turned his books,
and red both night and day:
He hoopt he told him he should escape,
if he could run his way.
A ridiculous pranke of a Priest.
A Certain guest the goblet clenzde
from flies, before he drank:
And having drunk, he cast again
the flies in goblet frank.
And told the cause why so he did,
no flies quoth he love I:
But whether you them love or not,
I can not say perdie.
Of a waterspaniell.
A Dog that had a Ducke in mouth,
an other gapt to catch:
So lost he that he had, and that
whereafter he did snatche.
The churlishe chuffe that has enough,
and sekes an others pelf:
Does oftentimes, and worthily,
lose that he has him self.
A Cur by a crib, a covetous miser.
THe cur that couchyng kepes the crib,
him self does eat no Haie:
Ne letts the hungry horse, that feign
thereon would feed and pray.
The Carle (like to the cruel Cur)
that plenty has of pelf:
Imparts no part to other men,
nor spends upon him self.
Of a Beggar, bearyng him self for a Physician.
YOu Medicus your self do term,

One letter more then Medicus,

Of a dishonest wife.
OF children fruitful, fruitful, is
Aratus wife perdie:
For children three she brought him for the
and with him did not lie.
To one whose wife was naught at home.
AT home a naughty wife thou have,
if toward her thou be cursed,
Then worse is she: if curtuous,
of all then is she worst.
Good will she be if so she dye,
but better if she dye,
And thou survive: but best of all,
if hence in haste she hye.
Of Tyndarus.
A Wight whose name was Tyndar, would
have kissed a pretty less:
Her nose was long: (and Tyndar he
a floutyng fellow was.)
Wherefore unto her thus he said,
I can not kiss you, sweet:
Your nose stands out so far, that sure
our lips can never meet.
The maiden nipt thus by the nose,
straight blushed as red as fire:
and with his girde displeased, thus
she spoke to him in ire.
Quoth she, if that my nose do let
your lips from kissyng mine:
You there may kiss me where that I,
have neither nose nor eyne.
To Sabinus whose wife conceived in his absence.
AN help and comfort to thy life,
and to the age of thine:
A goodly child is borne to thee,
haste hye, thee home Sabine.
Haste hye thee home to see thy wife,
the fruitful wife of thine:
And eke thy blessed new borne babe,
haste hye thee home Sabine.
Haste hye thee home in post post haste,
thou (...) be there in time:
Although thou hye thee nere so fast.
haste hye thee home Sabine.
Thy wife does lie and long for thee,
thy brat does braule and whine:
Both think thou tarriest ouerlong,
haste hye thee home Sabine.
Thou can not be unwelcome home,
when that a child of thine
Is borne, naie gotten to thy hands,
haste hye thee home Sabine.
Haste haste I say that yet at lest,
at sacred Fant-deuine
Thou may see dipped thy dillyng defte,
haste hye thee home Sabine.
Of Fuscus a drunkerd.
A certain man in physic skild
to F. spoke in this wise:
F. drink not overmuch (take heed)
for drink will loose your eyes,
He pausd upon this sentence given,
and pondered what was spoke:
And when he had bethought him, thus
at last his mind he broke.
I will by drinkyng loo^e mine eyes
quoth he, it is better so*
Then for to keep them for the worm^
to gnaw them out below.
Of a King and a Clown.
A Clown in forest fostered up,
the City came to see:
Then forest Faune, or Satyr wood,
more homely rude was he.
Much people all the streates about,
together thick did throng:
And nothing but the king does come,
they cried the street along.
The seely rustic half amazd,
to hear so strange a cry:
Much muzd, and tarried there to see,
what should be meant thereby.
At last upon a sudden comes,
the king with sumptuous train:
All brave bedeckt with glitteryng gold,
he gorgeous did remain
On comely courser hoisted hie:
now every where the croude
With strained throats God save the king
they cry, and cry alowde.
The king, the king, O where is he,
the Clown, began to cry:
(Quoth one) with finger pointed out
lo where he sitts on hye.
Tush that is not the king quoth he,
thou art deceued quight:
That seems but a man to me,
in painted vesture dight.
Of an unlearned Bishop.
THe Letter killes, the Letter killes,
thus always do thou cry:
And nothing save the letter killes,
thou have in mouth perdie.
But thou have well provided, that
no Letter thee shall kill:
For thou do know no Letter, thou
in Letters have no skill.
To one light minded.
IF that thou were as light of foot,
as thou art light of mind:
Thou would outrun the lightest Hare
and make him come behind.
A Jest of a Iackbragger.
A Country clounish Coridon,
did use abroad to rome:
And kept a bragging Thrasos wife,
while he was gonne from home.
When as the Soldier was returned,
and heard this of the Clown:
He stamped and stard, and swore gogsnownes,
I Will bent the villen down.
And went well weponed into feeld,
to seek his fellow out:
At last by chance he did him find,
raingyng the feeld about.
Ho sir said the soldier, stay:
you rascal villen vile
I must you bob: the clown did stay,
and took up stones and Tyle.
Shaking his sword the soldier said,
you slave you used my wife:
I did so said the clown, what then?
I love her as my life.
O do you then confess said he?
(by all the gods I swear)
If thou had not confessed the fact,
it should have cost thee dear.
Against a Parasite.
WHen Eutiches does run a race,
he seems to stand perdy:
But when he runs unto a feast,
then sure he seems to fly.
Against Chelonus.
WHy do thou loath Chelonus so,
the name of lumpish ass?
The learned Lucius Appuley,
an ass he sometime was.
But thou do differ much from him,
(he had a learned head)
He was a golden ass perdy,
thou art an ass of Lead.
A manly mind, and body of
an ass he had, we find:
But thou a manlike body have:
a doltishe asselike mind.
Of Sleep. The sentence of Aristotle
Half of our life is spent in sleep:
in sleep no difference is
Between the wealthy wight, and him
that wealth does want and miss.
Now Craesus thou rich caitiffe king,
though huge thy substance were:
Yet Irus poor in half his life,
did like to thee appear.
Desire of Dominion.
Amongst many kings,
skant one king shall you see
Content with kingdom one alone,
skant one, if one there be,
Amongst many kings,
skant one king shall you see
That rules one only kingdom right,
skant one, if one there be.
Remedies, to take away a stinkyng breath occasioned by sundry meats.
TO kill the stink of lothsom seeks,
thou must cranch Oynions fast:
If thou will not of Oynions stink,
eat Garlike strong in taste.
If after thou of Garlike strong,
the savor wilt expel:
A Mard is sure the only mean,
to put away the smell.
10. IOVIANVS PONTANVS.
Upon the grave of a Beggar.
WHile as I lyud no house I had,
now ded I have a grave:
In life I liude in lothsume lack,
now dead I nothing crave.
In life I livde an exile poor,
now death bryngs rest to me.
In life poor naked soul vnclad,
now clad in cloddes ye see.
Upon the Toumbe of Lucretia the daughter of Alexander.6.
HEre lies Lucretia chaste by name,
but Thais lewd by life:
Who was to Alexander Pope
both daughter, and his wife.
Of the infelcitie of Lovers.
THe Grasshopper in meadows grene,
among the fragrant flowers:
With chirpyng cheerful chitteryng shr^^^,
does pass the tedious hours.
And glads the goodly garnisht groves,
with lays and merry tunes:
And slumberyng under dewie grass,
the gladles night consumes.
She syngyng dies, and never feels
the smart of Parcas knife:
In sweet and heavenly harmony,
she leads and leaves her life.
O blessed in life, and blessed in death:
but me aye me alas:
Both day and night through girt with greef,
my days in dole I pass.
In Winter sharp, in froste and snow,
(a crooked caitiffe old)
I lie and cry before her doors,
quight curlde almost with cold.
Again in Summer cingyng hot,
when Phoebus fierce does reign:
Poor selie soul before her doors,
I (grouelyng) groan and plain.
I burn in love, age wears me out,
no day I find releef,
No night I rest: but day and night
still gript with gronyng greef.
Aye wretched are the young in love,
thrice wretched loving sires:
The Grasshopper still happy lives,
oh Cupids frantic sires.
GASPAR VRSINVS.
Of Thelesina.
SElde Thelesina does frequent
the Temples of the Priests:
And when she comes, she never but
a pissyng while persists.
Would know the cause why Ponticus,
abroad she does not rome?
It is her use these shauelyngs still,
with her to have at home.
ANTONIUS GOVEANVS.
Of Briandus Vallius.
WHen rumblyng thu^der thumps are heard in^
to save himself, all fearful Vallius flies
Down to some celler (where himself he hides)
he thinks in cellers never God abides.
A pretty prancke of a modest maiden.
ONe Furius would have kissed a maid:
she squaimish did appear
And in a fume gave Furius,
a whirret on the ear.
And therewith said, go kiss your hand,
to kiss if you delight:
Both hands and lips are flesh alike,
and both alike are white.
Of a Mounke.
A Sort of thieves had caught a Monk,
whereas they robde in wood:
They bad him preach, or yield his purse,
in place whereas he stood.
The Monk did yield himself to preach,
(he durst not disobaie:)
The thieves were silent hushed, and thus
the Monk began to say.
The lives, the labors eke of thieves,
I must commend perdie:
The toil they take, by land and lake,
does lead to lofty sky:
For Christ him self by land and sea,
did travel far and nere:
And never rested in one place,
as does by books appear.
So you my masters roue and range
abroad from place to place:
Still still you walk your stations,
not restyng any space.
Christ never plowde the clottered soil,
nor used seed to sow:
Yet did he live, and lacked naught:
you live, and lack you? no:
What more unto you should I say?
to judgment brought was he:
And he condemned was to death,
so likewise you shall be.
Christ likewise he was fixed on cross,
and hangde in sight of all:
And think you, you shall not be hangde?
yes trust to it, you shall.
Among the goblins black of hell,
descended Christ below:
And you among the grisly fiends,
to hell must likewise go.
Christ being thence returnde again,
on Gods right hand does sit:
But you shall never thence return,
once plungde in Plutos pit.
To Andreas Goueanus his brother.
I Brother, caught an Hare:
He fell to your share:
Who caught this Hare declare?
Again.
I Brother caught an Hare:
it fell to your lot
To eat him: so an Hare I lost,
and so an Hare I got.
To Zebedeus.
NE words of men, nor yet
the Senators decree:
Can make thee lay away thy heard,
so fair it seems to thee.
The man whose beard him noble makes,
he is not noble, he:
But who his beard nobilitates,
he noble seems to me.
CLAUDIUS ROSELETTVS.
A Lute of fir tree.
IN Forest when I livd,
I had no sound nor voice:
But made a Lute (with silver sound)
men's hearts I do rejoice.
Against women's lightness.
THe Plume, the Pumice stone, the air,
in lightness do surpass:
The Plume, the Pumice stone, the air,
in lightness women pass.
To Syluius, a lovely lad but lewdly lived.
IN all thy body bewty shines,
thy forhed shines fair:
Thy mouth does shine, thy nose, thy chin,
thy glisteryng golden hair.
But Syluius (as a stinkyng sink)
thy breast is foul within:
Thy mind is spotted, spatted, spilt,
thy soul is soyld with sin.
Ah painted Toomb stuffed full of stink:
more lothsum naught we find
Than he that fair has all things, save
his manners and his mind.
The Back.
SHe skirryng flittereth as a byrd,
and as a beast she goth
Fourfooted, and yet nether she
is counted of them both.
She feeds and breeds her young with milk,
she lays ne hatches eggs:
Black lether wings, and teeth she has,
two lips, and also legs.
To a towardly young man.
ALthough the root of Virtue seem
bitter to thee in taste,
Yet do not spit it out, the fruit
shall pleasant be at last.
To a certain Barber.
IF but to shave my beard (alone)
I Peter sent for thee:
Together both of purse and berd,
why have thou shaven me?
Against a Churl or thankles person.
A Cuntry wight with pity pricked,
(as writers erst have told)
Took up a Snake rakt up in snow,
quight curld almost with cold.
And plast him in his bosom warm:
again to life once brought,
He strikes and stings the man to death,
that for him so had wrought.
Unthankful as thou art, even so
thy friend thou do requite:
Thou givst him for a Perch receavd,
a Scorpion that does bite.
To a Thief.
THy feet are slow, thy speech is slow,
thy mind and all is slow:
But sure thy hands to filche and steal.
they be not slow I know,
When as thy filchyng fingers false,
to pick thou does prepare:
Remember still what punishments
for thieves ordained are.
An Epitaphe, of an excellent Shipmaster, or Pilote.
NEptune on Sea, gave luck to thee:
Mars made thee strong on land to be.
Now joy thou have (with Jove on hye)
above the glisteryng golden sky.
Great once wast thou on sea and land,
now great in heaven where stars do stand.
CLAUDIUS CLAVDIANVS.
Of a Bore, and a Lion.
THe cruel Bore and Lion cursed,
together fierce did fight:
The Bore of bristles bragd, in maine
did lie the Lions might.
Mars one, the other Cibel lauds,
fightyng in bloody broile:
Both kept on Mountains, both were fo^ld
by Hercules his toil.
Of a poor man in love.
ME pinchyng penury does pain,
and Cupid wounds my heart:
I hunger can abide, but not
of love the bitter smarte.
I live and lack: I live and love:
want does men sore annoye:
But sorer much the frantic flames,
of Cupid blinded boy.
IACOBVS ROGERIVS.
Under Hercules painted spinnyng.
WHat brynges not love to pass?
what does not love constrain?
It causd stout Hercules to spinne,
by whom were monsters slain.
Against the rich unlearned, out of Laertius.
WHat time Diogines, a dolte
in purple did behold:
I see (said he) a selie sheep,
in fell and fleece of gold.
Of three Grecians, writers of Tragedies.
THree Grecian Poets tragical,
did leave their lives and dye
Most straungely, as the stories of
the Grecians testify.
The first ycleped Sophocles,
(as writers sundry say)
Was chockt with kurnell of a grape,
that in his throat did stay.
Euripides the second (that
from women did refrain)
By cursed hap with cruel curres,
was all to torn and slain.
Now Aeschilus the third and last,
an Egle from an hye
Let fall a shell upon his pate,
which kilde him by and by.
GEORGIUS BVCHANANVS SCOTVS.
Of Rome.
I Nothing muse a Shepherd does,
in Rome the scepter hold:
Since that a Shepherd built the same,
(as sundry books have told)
And since the founder of the same,
with Wouluishe milk was fed:
I marvel nothing I at all,
though Rome of Woulues be spedde.
But this me thinks wondrous strange,
that safe a flock should rest
In Rome with rauenyng murdryng woulues,
and never be oppressed.
Against Pope Pius.
POpe Pius heaven for money sold:
Death will not let him stay,
In earth: then needs to hell below,
Pope P. must take his way.
Fratres EXTRA MVNDVM.
THese Omnia Munda do defile,
with finger, tail, and tongue:
In Mundo merito they say,
they dwell not men among.
H. STEPHANVS.
Of Auctus, a swilbole.
ALone to taste, up Auctus quast
a bole with wine full fraught:
Ne was he yet content with this,
but asked an other draught.
The gobler was not washed, he said,
and bad them fill again:
Which done, he drinks a fresh, and letts
no drop behind remain.
Now that so much he does require,
alone to taste and try:
How much trow you will he desire,
attacht with thirst and dry?
Of the book which Vincentius Obsopoeus wrote of the feat of drinkyng.
WHy do the Germans teach that art,
in which they skillful be?
Why are so many Doctors, tell,
made scholars unto thee?
Gul, bib, and bole, carouse, and quaffe,
each can in Germany:
Thou should have taught the^ (rather then)
the way how to be dry.
Of Aulus.
WHat Aulus does I do not ask:
but whether of these two:
Or drink, or sleep, for nothing else
does Aulus use to do.
Of Marcus.
TO sleep his furfet vile away,
Mark slepes out lightly half the day.
Some men (the cause that did not know)
Did ask him why he sleped so.
Quoth he, why does not David say?
It Is vanity to rise ere day.
To Ancus.
THou drunken faindst thy self of late:
thou three days after slepst:
How will thou sleep (with drink in deed)
when thou art thoroughly pepst?
To a certain drunkarde.
WHo termde thee drunkard, termde thee ill:
More drunk art thou, then dru^kard still.
Of Aulus.
Look when most sober Aulus is,
most drunk is Aulus he.
Again unless that he be drunk,
he sober can not be.
For sober still he braules and braies,
he tears, and on he takes:
And like a bedlem beast, both sand
and sea together shakes.
But when that he has quafte his fill,
no coile at all he keeps:
But casts himself upon his couche,
and (snortyng) soundly sleeps.
An Epitaphe, of a notorious drunkard.
THe corpse clapped fast in clottered claie,
that here engraude does lie:
On death-bedde swear, in all his life
that he but once was dry.
And (surely) thou may credit him
for that which he did say:
For all the while his life did last,
he thirsty was alwaie.
To Pontifer.
A Springall thou (in prime of years)
a beldame old ^^est wedde:
A toothlesse, tough, old Mumphim^,
with quyueryng palsy spedde.
Thou thoughtst thy pelf and poked pence,
by this device to spare:
Thou thoughtst a maid would eat to much
and make thy bouget bare.
Thou art deceiude: by this devise
naught shall thou save: I think
Young maids they will not eat so much,
as aged trotts will drink.
Of a Jade most vile and pestilent.
Hard iron spurs no more estemes,
this dull and blockishe Jade:
Then spurs of woole, or silken spurs,
as soft as can be made.
Again.
THis Jade does seem no more to feel,
the prickyng of a spur:
Then does a stone, or member dedde,
the which may nothing stir.
Again.
THe spur that cuttes and gores the gu^s
no more does he regard:
Then sturdie stith, where beats the Smith,
the batteryng hammer hard.
Again.
BY stickyng spur do seek to stir
thy st^ede that will not stere:
Thou go about to tell a tale,
to him that can not hear.
Again.
SPare spare to spur it naught auailes:
Spurs serve for other horse:
Ricke, prick, spurn, spur: pinche, pu^ch and panche
thou shall not stir a corse.
Again.
THis blockishe beast, as soon as he
of any man is spide:
Straitwaies he says, behold an Ass,
trust up in horses hide.
Again.
SO slowly goes this mopishe Jade,
(whereon you use to ride)
As hard and skant of Linx him self,
his mouyng may be spide.
Again.
IF sluggishe sloth had ever son or child:
This same is he, unless I be beguild.
Again.
EVen look how much the Heart excelles
the Ass to run a race:
So much this horse of every horse
beside is paste in pace.
Again.
HE semes as he were still a sleep:
it may be so he slepes
As does the Hare, who slepyng still,
his eyes broad open kepes.
Again.
CVt out this cursed Cabals cods
betyme, if you do well:
What will his ofspryng be, but even
a very plague of hell.
Again.
WHat shall we do with this same beast?
how shall we use him, tell?
Him serve as Flaccus ass was serud,
and so you serve him well.
OVT OF THE POEMES OF M. GVALTER HADDON.
The way to live well.
IF thou will lead a godly life,
and not from virtue swerue:
Be wary wise, and always these
six things in mind observe.
1
Remember first the Lord thy God,
which thee of naught did make:
2
Next mind thou Satan serpent slye,
that seeks thy soul to take.
3
Next mind the shortness of this life,
that fades like a flower:
4
Next mind thy grave, continually
which galpes thee to devour.
5
Next mind thou gladsome Joys of heaven:
6
next lastyng plagues of hell:
And so an end: mind these, and thou
can never live but well.
Precepts of wedlock. The husbands requests.
MY wife, if thou regard mine ease:
Pray to the Lord: him praise and please.
Displease not me (for any thing)
Care how thy children up to bring:
Let still thine house be neat and fine:
Always provide for children thine:
Be merry, but with modesty,
Lest some men blame thine honesty:
Let manners thine be pleasant still:
With Iackes yet do not play the gyll.
Go in thy garments soberly,
Let no spot be thereon to spy.
Be merry when that I am merry:
When I lowre, sing not thou Hey derry.
The man that lyked is of me,
Let him likewise be likt of thee.
That which I say in company,
See thou refell not openly.
If ought I speak that likes not thee,
Thereof in secret monish me.
What so in secret I thee tell
Reveal not, but conceal it well.
Think not strange Wives do make me warm
When I thee hurt, show me thy harm.
Confess when so thou do offend:
Chide not to bedward when we wend.
Sleep slightly: rise betyme, and pray:
When thou art dressed, to woork away.
Believe not all thing that is said:
Speak little (as beseemes a maid)
In presence mine dispute thou not:
Reply not: chat must be forgot.
The honest do associate still:
Loath living with the lewd and ill.
Let lewdnes none thy life afford:
Be always true of tongue and word:
Let shame fastnes thy mistres be:
Do these, and wife come cull with me.
The wives answer.
Husband, if thou will pure appear,
(Even as thy self) then hold me dear.
So shall thou please Iehoue divine,
So shall thou make me norrishe mine.
See that our house wherein we dwell
Be hansome, wholesome, walled well.
And let us have what use requires:
Make servants sweat at work, not fires.
See that thy speech be mild and meek.
Of froward frumps be still to seek.
If thou will have me do for thee,
Then see thou likewise do for me.
If thou on thy friends do bestow,
Be liberal to my friends also.
For servants thine keep tauntyngs tart,
Admonish gently me aparte.
And when in sport some time I spend,
Do thou not sharply reprehend.
And when I joy with thee to jest,
In angry mood, do not molest.
It Is not enuffe, that I love thee:
But sometime thou must make of me.
If I shall not of thee be ielowes,
See thou cleave not to many fellows.
Though thou have toyled out the day
At night be merry yet always.
Use never much abroad to rome:
But still keep close with me at home.
Thou said much, when thou wast an woer,
Now (we are coupled) be a doer.
Penelope if I shall be,
Then be Ulysses unto me.
Desire not to obtain, that which thou can not gain.
HE that will choose a wretch to be,
A very wretch indeed is he:
Then he that goods desires to gain
Which by no means he may obtain
A very wretch indeed is he:
For he does choose a wretch to be.
BY VERTVE NOT VIGOVR.
Win even the wayward Virtue will,
and Virtue makes willing still.
Force furious fomyng fights fearce:
But Virtue does with reason pearce.
In body Force his seat does find,
Virtue triumphs still in mind.
Force makes men like beasts to be,
But Virtue makes men we see.
Wherefore rude boisterous Force fare well,
For Virtue brave shall bear the bell.
Let Force to Virtue bow and bend:
Or Mistres on the Maid attend.
How every age is inclined.
THe Babe (deuoyde of wit and sense)
In Cradle still does cry:
The Lad by lightness lewd does loose
his time, and runs awrye.
From 12. to 21. Youth
runs rashly on his race:
The Lusty Youth to lawles lust
and riot runs apace.
The Man still hunts for honors hie:
the Senior serious seeks
For wealth and coin: glad when into
his pragged purse he peekes.
A noble dame: I hide her name.
FOr visage thou art Venus right:
Pallas for flowing brain:
To finger fine the Harp or Lute
Apollo thou do stain.
Mercurius rules thy filed speech,
thy manners Cynthia chaste:
O gallant goddess: Juno meet
with Jove for to be plast.
Of the Queens Picture.
O Pity great alas to see,
that Virtue shinyng so
With Beauty brave, must forced be
at last away to go.

(Fool as thou art) what do thou mean,
thy fadyng form to draw?
A new face, or else no face, thou
shall have to morrow, daw.
Of the picture of the most excellent Dame A. H.
FOr prudencie, a precious pearl:
for face, a famous dame:
In fine this piece in every point,
deserves laud and fame.
To his Bed.
MY bed, the rest of all my cares,
the end of toilyng pain:
Which bryngest ease and sollace sweet,
while darkness does remain.
My bed, yield to me slumber sweet,
and triflyng dreams repel:
Cause carkyng care from sobbyng breast
to part, where it does dwell.
All mockeries of this wretched world,
put clean from out my mind:
Do these my bed: and then by thee,
much comfort shall I find.
An Answer.
THat I may be a rest of cares,
an end of toylyng pain:
See stomach thine be not surchargde,
when sleep thou would gain.
If sugared sleep (deuoide of dreams)
thou likest to enjoy:
Then live with little: and beware,
no cares thy hedde anoye.
And lastly deem thy fethered bed,
always thy graspyng grave:
So rest by me thou shall obtain,
and eke much comfort have.
An Epitapthe upon the death of Sir IHON CHEKE.
THe master of good manners mild,
the glisteryng lamp of skill:
Dame Natures golden workehouse rare,
now death has rid from ill.
Ah noble sir Ihon Cheke is dedde,
which steadfast still did stand
Not one to many, but to all:
the lantern of this land.
The gem of this our English soil:
fell death that riddeth all
So rich a jewel never took,
nor take hereafter shall.
IHON PARKHVRST, late Bishop of NORWICH.
To the Reader.
When reader thou do read this book,

These are not made: but if they bend
Their eyes to see what here is pende:
Such toys they shall be sure to find
As will refreshe the mestfull mind.
To Torpetus.
THy wife Torpetus brings thee naught:
Thou musest what should let:
Muse not: how ca^ she bring thee aught
When thou can naught beget.
An Epitaph upon the death of a Covetous Miser.
AN yearthly wight in earth,
I studied yearthly things:
Even like a Moldiwarpe,
to earth which always clings.
Now yearthly body mine,
in earth with worms does bide:
But sinful soul (alas)
to Limbo down does slide.
Waifarer hence depart,
take heed, be warnde by me:
Remember heavenly things,
cast yearthly things from thee.
Of Robin Bartlet falling into the hands of Thieves.
BArtlet a pleasant sconse, whose mirthe
all men did much delight:
Ridyng toward London on a time,
amongst Thieves did light.
When they had robde him of his coin,
quoth one (among the rest)
My masters let us cut his throat,
for fear we be expreste.
Then Bartlet answered pleasauntly,
(naie do not serve me so)
My masters if you cut my throat,
how shall my drink down go.
At this the Thieves began laugh apace,
and from him went their way:
So silly Bartlet saude his life,
although his purse did pay.

Against Bossus, a Priest.

Or else somany baldpate priests,
could never sires remain.

Of Molzus that cast his wife into the Sea.
WHat time a troublous tempest rose,
and tossed the tumblyng Seas:

Naught heavier then askoldyng wife,
I deem there can be waied.

What so the one of them does love,
the other likes of life.

A shrew thou married have, does this

Of a certain Duke, and Robin Bartlet.
A Certain Duke with Bartlet chafte,
said, leave you knave to scoff
And mend your manners, or I swear,

Quoth Bartlet, God forbid, that were

Thus all the broile and anger great,

Of certain fair maidens plaiyng with Snow.
YOu virgins fairer then the Snow

in time shall sone decay.

Against Bossus.
ALL Priests must gelded be,
thus say thou Bossus still:

If Bossus thou had gealt thy self,
and stones of thine cut out:
So many basterd brats of thine,
had not been borne about.
Of Attus.
IF Attus face thou do behold,

But if thou do behold the rest,

how can this be declare?
Against Alanus.
THou love Dogs,
Dogs do thou feed:
But thou do hate

Better to be
thy Dog then wife.

Of ROBIN BARTLET, fainyng himself deaf to get lodgyng, being on a time
benighted.
WHen down Dan Phoebus began to ducke,
and shroude him in the West:
When darksome night approached fast,
and all did silent rest.
When Aeolus king with puffed chekes,
began blow and bluster fearce:
When dashyng showers down dingyng fast
both man and beast did pearce.
When fir^e flakes, and lightnyng leames,
began flashe from out the skies:
When stiff, strong, struglyng, sturdie storms,
began for to arise.
All in this hurly burly great,
it chanced so perdie:
That merry Bartlet was abroad,
deuoyde of company.
In ridyng he had lost his way,
in great distress was he:
For postyng here and there, he could
no town nor village se.
But he that looks at last shall find,
so he by Fortune saw
At last a simple cottage poor,
all homely thatcht with Straw.
His hands he heaues to heaven on high,
and thanks with heart and voice
His God that gave him this good hap,
and greatly did rejoice.
He comes to this cabin course,
and knocks at the door:
And strait with humble suit and moan,
for help he does implore.
If any wife dwell here (quoth he)
that honesty does love:
Let this my piteous percyng plaint,
her mind to mercy move.
Then lo the goodwife of the house,
(whose name did Florence hight)
Came to the door, and spoke unto
poor Barrlet woeful wight.
Away quoth she, what ere thou be,
be sure thou comst not here:
So late thou wandrest in the night,
thou art a thief I fear.
Be packyng while your bone be whole:
I thank you Bartlet said:
(And faind him self for to be deaf)
I thank you for your aid.
May horse of mine have room (quoth he)
here likewise to remain?
No no quoth she: I thank you sure,
said Bartlet here again,
And went to Stable with his horse:
at last he did her win
(By thanks and gentle words) to open
the door, and let him in.
All that same night he snortyng slept,
fast by the fire side:
And all his garments sowst with rain,
by smokyng fire he dride.
When fair Aurora at the last,
began for to appear:
And bright Apollo with his beams,
began to glister clear.
Dame Florence starteth up from bed,
and sone she slippeth on
Her petticote: and fetchyng wood,
she makes fire anon,
She deeming Bartlet fast a sleep,
eke deaf, a fart let flee:
God morrow dame (quoth Bartlet straight)
what speak you unto me?
Quoth Florence what? and can you hear?
now sure I Joy therefore:
I see my tail has made you hear,
which could not hear before.
Of Caelia, and her son, now ready to dye.
WHen Caelia (sad and sorrowful)
her son sore sick did see:
Now when his breath began to fail,
with blubberyng tears said she
O my sweet son, ere life be done,
speak one sweet word to me:
But one sweet word, my sweet sweet son,
I do request of thee:
The son now giuyng up the ghost,
as breath away began pass:
Cried, honny, honny, mother mine,
( sweet honey) ah alas.
And soundyng so these sugared words,
he dyed by and by:
And cherefull thus unto the heavens,
his soul soard swift on hye.
Of Editha, trauelyng in childbed.
WHen as a newborn blessed babe,
Editha forth had brought:
The women said he was as like,
his sire as might be thought.
What is his crown balde (bare of hear)
I pray you show, said she:
And thus Editha signified,
a Priest the sire to be.
Of a certain Bishop, and his fool Philibert.
A Certain Prelat kept a fool,
to make him game and sport:
This fool hight Philibert: his lord
did love him in such sort
That he would let him lie with him,
in bed whereas he lay:
Not side by side, but at his feet
this fool did couche always.
One night the Bishop had his trull,
in bed with him to lie:
The fool was waking, and by hap,
four legs he felt him by:
Ho master (quoth the fool) I feel
four legs: whose be they, thine?
Yea (quoth his master) Philibert
those legs they all be mine.
Then Philibert straight startyng up,
unto the window hyes.
And (puttyng out his noddyes nole)
with Stentors voice he cries
Monstrum horrendum come and see,
all men, both young and old:
My master that had two feet erst
Has four now to behold.
Against Claudia.
A Virgin thou will called be,
a virgin counted eake:
And still in praise of virgins pure,
still Claudia thou do speak:
But why do thou praise virgins so?
thy self no virgin art:
For thou did bear a virgin late,
which was no virgins part.
To a certain friend.
A Kerchef thou do wear: head ache
does not torment thee rise:
Nor sickness: surely thou have felt,
the Distaffe of thy wife.
Of an egregious drunkard.
A Drunkard great did fall into
a fervent fever sore:
Whereby he felt a greater thirst,
then erst he did before.
He sends for Physicians strait:
unto him they do give
Both for to cure his fever, and
his thirst away to drive.
To whom the pained party spoke:
Physicians, only see
That you my fever cure, my thirst
leave that to cure for me.
To certain proud Papisticall persons.
SOme men do call you holy men:
and some again do choose
To call you Fathers: glad are you
when they such titles use.
But holy I can not you call,
which holiness disdain:
But fathers I may call you well,
for brats you get amain.
To Pope Paulus. 2.
THou needst not Rome for to request,
of Paul his stones to show:
He has begot a daughter la te,
he is a man I trow.
Of Pope Ione the 8. and of the manner of making the Pope.
POpe Ione in man's apparel went,
and faind her self a man:
And by this strange disguisyng, she
at last the Popedom wanne.
At last she played a piuishe part,
and let her servant ride
In saddle hers: she travailed,
brought forth her child, and died.
When as the Carnals ( Cardinals
I would say if I could)
When they perceiude this filthy fact,
they all agreed none should
Be Pope created after that,
unless he had his stones:
They would not have ye Popedom staynde,
with any more Pope Jones.
But now adays at Rome we see,
this custom waxes cold:
What is the cause they grope not now,
as they were wont of old?
The cause is, now they know before,
that they are men in deed:
For now in every corner swarm
their whores, and bastard breed.
Of Lucretia which was daughter and wife to Pope Alex. 6.
WHat make thou Lucretia,
with chaste Lucretias name?
Thou art an other Thais, thou,
an other Lais dame.
Of Nodosius, a Papist.
AT pointed seasons still,
Nodosius does refrain
From eating flesh: and yet from flesh,
no day he does abstain.
Do ask how this may be?
I will explane the case:
Dedde flesh mislikes Nodosius, but
live flesh he does embrace.
Of a certain yongman, and a toothlesse sire.
A Yongman and an aged sire.
at Tavern drinkyng sat:
At last (well whitled both with wine)
they fell at great debate.
And striude about a thing of naught:
the yongman all in ire
Burst out and said, turde in thy teeth,
old crooked crabbed sire.
The old man pleasauntly replide:
turde in his teeth (quoth he)
That has teeth: I have none at all,
behold, and thou shall se.
And so he showed his naked gummes,
where no teeth did remain:
And thus the strife and great debate,
did cease between them twain.
To a proud princox.
WHy art thou proud? stout poutyng pride
from heavenly joys on hie
Down hedlong tumbled Lucifer,
in Limbo low to lie.
To Pigmenius.
THou wealthy have both house and land,
Eke thou the Law do understand.
By hook and crook thou catchest still,
In cusnyng craft thou have great skill.
Thy fingers to can filche full fast,
(For all these) yet no coin thou haste.
How comes it to pass would know?
The speckled bones often thou do throw.
Of Cotilus a Priest.
NO maids loves Cotilus: old wives
he loves (as all may see)
What is ye cause? maids bring forth brats,
old wives still barren be.
Against Huberdine, an old dottrell and peuish Preacher.
WHo preaches naught but triflyng toys,
unto the people still:
A pratyng preacher may be calde,
deuoyde of wit and skill.
To Ruffina. He plays the woer for a friend of his, of person as pretty as a
Pigmey.
Despise not this thy suter small,
that loves thee as his life:
And thee desires Ruffina fair,
to be his spouse and wife.
In bodies deft of dapper Dicks
great virtue often does dwell:
Perchance in bed thou shall him prove
a man, I can not tell.
Of the insatiable covetousness of this world.
A Golden great ungodly world,
this may be counted well:
Each man loves gold: but godliness,
who loves I can not tell.
To Pontiana, a maid so called.
Snow held unto the fire does melt,
and ceasseth Snow to be:
So Pontiana perish those,
that burn in love with thee.
To Claudia.
OF late thine hears were black, but now
they shine, gold like unto:
With any Painter fine of late,
tell, had thou to do?
Of Antonina.
IN bosom hers, a dapper Dog,
still Antonina bears:
She lulles him, culles him, louyngly
she luggs him by the ears.
She would not miss her fistyng curre,
for any thing: and why?
Forsothe when so she letts a escape,
she cries me, fie curre, fie.
To Ihon Cullier.
LIke dombe dog Hennus never barks,
all preaching he does shun:
And yet thou say his duty still,
by him is duly done.
He drinks, he hunts, he hunteth whores,
he smacks: how say thou? tell?
Does he his duty due? does he
perform his function well?
Of Glaurus an old dotyng Priest.
GLaurus is crooked, all for age:
he still prepares to dye:
Yet Glaurus has a pretty wench,
at home with him to lie.
To Hermannus Mennus.
Poor have I been, and poor I am,
and poor still shall I be:
And Mennus lo, the cause I will,
declare and show to thee.
Martial.
If poor thou be Aemilian,
thou shall be poor always:
For none but wealthy wordlyngs are,
enriched now adays.
Of Clytus.
ON Saterdaie no flesh,
will Clytus eat perdie:
But for to steal an horse,
on Sunday he will hie.
This Monostichon here followyng, was written upon the gate of the Monestarie
of the Benedictines, or black Monks.
HIc intret nullus, nisi pullus sit sibi Cullus.
No manner wight, shall enter here:
Unless black hoode on back he bear.
Barbara vox Cullus: pro qua pone^da Latina est
Et poterit carmen forsitan esse bonum.
Cullus is sure a barbarous word,
skant Latin for an whood:
To Culus Cullus therefore change,
so may the verse be good.
Hic intret nullus, nisi pullus sit sibi Culus.
No manner wight shall enter here:
Unless he black be, you wot where.
Of the answer of a fool to a certain Duke.
Unto the palace of the Poope,
there came a Duke of late:
The Popes fool chaunst to mete the Duke
before the palace gate:
Where is thy master quoth the Duke?
not far the fool began say:
For but even very now his grace,
was with his whore at play.
Of Rob. Bartlet, and of one that had a foul byg nose, and a precious (as they
term it.)
BY fortune merry Bartlet saw
a man with monstrous Nose:
Beset with Rubies rich: his mind
thus Bartlet began disclose.
Goodfellow, friend, (quoth Bartlet) when
wast thou with goldsmith tell?
The other musing stayed, and knew
not what to answer well.
I ask (quoth Bartlet) for because*
he cosened thee I see:
He for a golden nose has given
a copper nose to thee.
The Lover.
WHo more a wretch then he
whom love ^ormenteth sore?
With scorchyng heat of Cupids coals
he burns evermore.
Of Love.
Love is for to be liked, if
both love (so as they ought)
But where one loves, the other lothes,
there love is vile and naught.
To Hordenus.
I Marrige mind: thou mockest me
as much as may be thought.
If whores I both should hunt and haunt
what would thou then say? naught.
Of Alphus.
NO egg on friday Alphe will eat,
but drunken he will be
On friday still: O what a pure
religious man is he.
Of him that is in debt.
WHo owes much money, still
he shunns all company:
And is like to an owl
That in the night does fly.
To Ponticus.
Do ask why ( Ponticus) I call
thee not to supper mine.
The cause is this: thou calst me not
hog Ponticus to thine.
To Minsiger.
AS poor as Irus once thou wast,
but now thou do abound
With wealth and store: by marriage thine,
great plenty have thou found.
But now thy wife is dead, thy coin
thou lashest out amayne:
Spare Minsiger le^t thou become
as Irus poor again.
Of Squyre, an old man flewmatike.
SQuyre seld or never Oysters buys,
Squyre eat no oysters will:
Yet notwithstanding Squyre spits out
and spawleth oysters still.
Of Cotta.
AN whore has Cotta to his wife,
he knows it, and he says:
One Lamp sufficient is to light
ten men and ten always.
N. NOMAN To B. Bonner.
ALL men a noughty Bishop did thee call:
I say thou wast the best of Bishops all.
To a certain Papist.
IT ill beseems preistes to we^
thus Papist thou do say:
What well beseemes them (then declare)
with whores to sport and play?
To a wife, which set a pot full of flowers in her window.
TO make a fragrant savor sweet,
in window thou do set
Fresh flowers, and for to make them grow,
thou stinkyng mier do get:
Wife, cast the mier away, or herbs,
or both I thee desire:
The flowers they do not smell so well,
as ill does stink the mire.
Of a counterfeit Devil.
BLastus a cunnyng Painter, (that
Apelles past in skill:)
Did paint the Devil in this wise,
in form and fashion ill.
Monstrous, deformed to behold,
fierce, black, and horrible:
Dauntyng the hearts of men with dread,
and fear most terrible.
His eyes did shine like sparklyng fire,
all broad and blasing bright:
His snout was stretched forth, his tail
was long, and black to sight.
His chappes were great, and galping wide,
all ready to devour:
With long down dangling iagged beard,
he looked grim and sower.
His horns were like unto the Moon,
that glisters in the night:
His paws were like fell Harpeyes paws,
that scratch and tear out qi^ght.
In right hand stones he clinched fast,
in left he held a book:
And eake a payr of beads he had,
whereon to pray and look.
His outward garments all were black,
even such they were to eye
As mopishe Monks, and foolish Friars,
did wear most commonly.
A Monk came by (by chance) and saw
the Picture set to show:
No where is Blastus said the Monk?
is he at home or no?
Ymarry Blastus answered,
what is your will with me?
The Diuelles picture will you buy?
perchance I will said he.
But tell me Blastus said the Monk,
why is he made so fell?
I like him not in some respects,
in some yet woondrous well.
Wherefore now breefly Blastus show
(in few declare to me)
Why thou have made him in such sort,
as here I do him see?
Then Blastus answered (and said)
if that you do not know
The causes why I made him thus,
the causes I will show.
Well (quoth the Monk) then tell me first,
why did thou make him black?
Quoth Blastus, for because that he,
does fair conditions lack.
Quoth Monk, why is his beard vnkemd,
and danglyng down so low?
Quoth Blastus, for because he was,
an Hermit long ago.
Why quoth the Monk has he a tail?
he moves to Lechery:
Why has he crooked cruel claws?
he loves to catch perdie.
Why in his right hand holds he stones?
with stones Christ tempted he:
What book in left hand does he hold?
Popes holy laws they be.
Why are such horns fixed on his front?
like Moses he in this:
(Yet godly Moses he does hate,
this sure and certain is.)
Why is he picturde like a Monk?
he monkery did devise:
Monks mischeuous he first brought forth,
and noughtie Nonnes likewise.
The Monk no longer now forebeares,
but for a cudgel feels:
And Blastus to avoid the blows,
straight takes him to his heels.
The pursie Monk pursues him fast,
and takes him by the hear:
And all to thumpes him with his fiste,
his nails his face does tear.
Better provoke the fend himself,
then monk that ragyng raues:
Poor Blastus did not know that Monks,
were vile and testie knaves.
An Epitaphe upon the death of KING EDWARD the 6.
WHen EDWARD prince most excellent,
fell cankered death did kill:
When God did give him place in heaven,
with Saints to so iourne still,
Good King Josias came to him,
and did him fast embrace:
And said, ah welcome brother mine
to happy heavenly place.
Of Lydia.
Seven years was Lydia linkt, and liude
with husband hers in deed:
And all the while poor Lydia lackt
and could no children breed.
She of Physicians counsel asked,
their medcines wrought but dull:
Of Bossus priest she counsel asked,
and straight way she was full.
To Florianus.
THy first wife (still thou say)
brought thee no child at all:
But sure (thou say) thy second wife,
brought thee a pretty squaule.
Indeed, a brat she did thee bring,
yet none she did bring thee:
For it it named thine to be,
and yet thine not to be.
To Haerillus.
NO work Haerillus does, and yet
he labors evermore:
How labors he? even of the gowte*
which does torment him sore.
Of Hassus.
I Did demand of Hassus, how
his wife (sore sick) did fare:
She will come shortly well abroad
(quoth he) I take no care.
Now (sure) who would not Hassus deem,
a Prophet true to be?
The next day after (on a Bear)
stone dead brought forth was she.
Of Furnus a Cuckold.
MEn say that Furnus iealowes, is
as quick as Linx of fight:
And oftentimes he uses eyes
of glass, clear glistering bright.
Now since that Furnus has four eyes,
and well decerneth still:
It makes me muse and marvel much
why still he sees so ill.
His wife is wicked, wanton still:
which he does never see:
Fool Furnus does not see so well,
but sure as ill sees he.
Of Pope Innocent. 8.
Eight boys Pope Nocent did ^eger,
as many maids in all:
O Rome, most justly may thou sure
this Pope a father call.
Of Alexander 6. and his daughter Lucretia.
NO gelding Alexander was:
now do thou ask me why?
Lewd Lucrece was his daughter, and
his wife with him to lie.
Against Claudia.
TWo kisses Bossus asked of thee,
when I in prensence was:
(He would have given money to)
of him thou did not pass.
Thou giuste no kisses openly,
close thou do kiss amayne:
Of kisses thou to sparing art,
to lauishe eke again.
To David Whitehed.
Unto me Willobey does write,
that Podagra the gowt
Does pain thee still: but Chiragra
does pain thee out of dout.
The first remains in the feet,
the second in the fiste:
Thou can not write to me, but go
well can thou, if thou list.
To Leopoldus.
I Have thee promisde much, thou ^ai^^*
what now declare to me?
What I have promisd I will give:
I nothing promisde thee.
Against Gaspus, which with one draught of wine or ale would be made drunk.
GAspus, if thou will not be drunk
then mark what I shall say:
When as thou drinkest, drink thou of
an empty cup always.
Against Colt a Priest.
THose that deem Colt has nothing done,
they greatly are beguild:
He has done somewhat, he has played
the colt, and got a child.
To the Reader.
IF so but six good Epigrams,
in all my book there be:
Then all is not pild paultrie stuff,
which reader thou do see.
But if six good thou do not find,
refuse then all the rest:
And let them serve to wipe thy tail
if so thou think it best.
To the Reader.
SVfficient now, nay to to much
I trifled have with thee:
Farewell good reader: here an end:
no more I Will troublous be.
Ludicra per verbares saepe notat^r acerba.
M. ROGER ASCHAM.
The sentence which Darius King of Persia commanded to be engraven on his
Toumbe.
DARIUS the King lies buried here:
Who in riding and shoting had never pere.
The graceless grace of the Court.
TO laugh, to lie, to flatter, to face:
Four ways in Coure to win me^ grace.
If thou be thrall to none of these,
Away good Pekegoose, hence Ihon Cheese.
Mark well my word and mark their deed,
And think this verse part of thy Creed.
A verse of Homer, translated into English, by M. Watson.
ALL trauelers do gladly report great praise of Ulysses:
For that he knew many men's manners, and saw many cities.
Of the herb Moly, translated out of Homer.
NO mortal man, with sweat of brow, or toil of mind:
But only God, who can do al, yt herb does find.
Of Newters.
NOw new, now old, now both, now neither:
To serve the worlds course, they care not with whether:
Master Aschams lamentation for the death of master Ihon Whitney.
Mine own Ihon Whitney, now farewell,
now Death does part us twain:
No Death, but partyng for a while,
whom life shall join again.
Therefore my heart cease sighs and sobbes
cease sorrows seed to sow:
Whereof no gain, but greater greef,
and hurtful care may grow.
Yet when I think upon such guiftes,
of grace as God him lent:
My loss, his gain, I must awhile,
with joyful tears lament.
Young years to yield such fruit in Court,
where seed of vice is sown:
Is sometime read, in some place seen,
amongst us seldom known.
His life he lead, Christ's lore to learn,
with will to work the same:
He read to know, and knew to live,
and liude to praise his name.
So fast to friend, so foe to few,
so good to every wight:
I may well wish, but scarsly hope,
again to have in sight.
The greater joy his life to me,
his death the greater pain:
His life in Christ so surely set,
does glad my heart again.
His life so good, his death better,
do mingle mirthe with care:
My spirit with joy, my flesh with greef,
so dear a friend to spare.
Thus God the good, while they be good,
does take: and leaves us ill:
That we should mende our sinful lives,
in life to tarry still.
Thus we well left, be better reft,
in heaven to take his place,
That by like life and death, at last,
we may obtain like grace.
Mine own Ihon Whitney again farewell,
a while thus part in twain:
Whom pain does part in earth, in heaven
great joy shall join again.
A golden sentence out of Hesiodus.
THat man in wisdom passes all,
to know the best who has a head:
And meetly wise eke counted shall,
Who yields him self to wise men's read:
Who has no wit, nor none will hear,
Among all fools the bell may bear.
A verse of Homer.
WHat follies so ever great princes make:
The people therefore do go to wrack.
An excellent saying of Homer.
WHo either in earnest or in sport,
does frame himself after such sort,
This thing to think, and that to tell,
my heart abhors as gate to hell.
A saying of Adra^tus, out of Euripides.
WHat thing a man in tender age has most in ure,
That same to death always to keep he shall be sure:
Therefore in age who greatly longs good fruit to mow:
In youth he must him self apply good seed to sow.
FINIS.
TRIFLES BY TIMOTHE KENDAL devised and written (for the most part) at sundry
times in his young and tender age.

Tamen est laudanda voluntas.

CORNELIUS GALLVS.
Diuersos diuersa iuuant, non omnibus annis
omnia conueniunt, res prius apta nocet.
Exultat leuitate puer, grauitate senectus,
inter vtru^que manens stat iuuenile decus.
Hunc tacitum tristemque decet, fit clarior ille
laetitia, and linguae garrulitate suae.
THE AVTHOR TO HIS Pamphlets and Trifles.
BOrbon in France bears bell away,
for writing trifles there:
In England Parkhurst praised is,
for writing trifles here.
Now since that these were learned both,
and trifles did indite:
Shall I now shame, of youthful days,
my triflyng toys to write?
No sure I blushe not: hence my book,
let all men read thy verse:
Grave men grave matters, sportfull youth
must sportfull toys rehearse.
Now reader lend thy listnyng ear,
and after syngyng Lark:
Content thy self of chattyng Crow,
some homely notes to mark.
The Author to himself.
T To serve thy God, thy Prince, thy soil,
endeavor all thy life:
I In peace delight: seek still to stay,
the storms of sturdie strife.
M Make much of Modesty: be meke:
take heed to clime to hye:
O Offend not one: be true in heart:
all filthy flattery fly.
T Take time in time: te^per thy tongue:
from filthy talk refrain:
H Help hapless men: and hope for heaven:
by patience conquer pain:
E Eat so to live, live so to die,
die so to live again.
K Keep Counsel close: be fast to friend:
and always know thy self:
E Esteem thou lastyng heavenly joys:
pass not for worldly pelf.
N Naught tell, that close thou would have kept.
great guile in men does lurk:
D Delight not to deceive by craft,
go plainly still to work.
A Abandon vice, let virtue guide:
vile sloth eschew and shun.
L Learn still to know, and know to live*
and live to praise the Son.
L Live in the Lord: so shall thou live
at last when all is done.
A Comparison between CHRIST and the POPE.
TO rule and reign in pompous Pride,
naught cared Christ at all:
The Pope by wiles and wicked war
subdues both great and small.
A Crown of thorn with scratching pricks
our Christ did willing wear:
A triple gorgeous crown of gold
the Pope on head does bear.
Christ washed his poor Disciples feet
as sacred Scripture shows:
The Pope must have the regal kings
come kiss his spangled toes.
Christ like a painful Pastor pure,
his flock did feed and fill:
The Pope in pleasure spends his time
and lives in riot still.
Our Savior Christ endured pain
and sufferd pinchyng want:
The great and glorious golden world
the Pope suffices scant.
With patience Christ the Cross did bear
and was content with it:
The Pope on shoulders borne by men
in solemn sort must sit.
All worldly wealth our Savior Christ
contemd and set at naught:
The Pope does burn with love of gold
as much as may be thought.
Our Savior Christ did tribute pay
(as Scripture mention makes)
The polyng Pope the Clergy plagues
and of them tribute takes:
The Marchaunts from the temple, Christ
expulst and put away:
The Pope receives them willingly,
and keeps them still for ay.
Our Christ in quiet pleasing peace
did joy and take delight:
The Pope in blood and battle bragges
and weapons glisteryng bright.
An humble heart, and mildenes meek
in Christ did still abide:
The furly Pope does swim in silks
and swell in powtyng pride.
Our Savior Christ had still his hands
all naked, plain, and bare:
The Pope has fingers fraught with ringes
and stones, both rich and rare.
Our Savior Christ regarded naught
this roystyng rich array:
The Pope has maskyng mad attire
of gold and purple gay.
Christ for a Colt an asses fool
his two disciples sent:
And on their homly mantels rude
to ride he was content.
The Pope on Courser hoysted hye
through Rome must prick and iet:
Whose bridle brave and saddle shines
with Pearl and gold befret.
All Ordenances, statutes, laws,
that Christ did keep and will:
All every one both more and less
the spightfull Pope does spill.
Christ to the golden sky ascends
that glitteryng, glorious shows:
The Pope to Pluto plunging packs
where fire with brimstone glowes.
Written in heuines.
LIke as the wounded wight
desires the Surgions hand:
And as the Creeple lame
desires legs to stand.
And as one far on seas
for land both longes and looks:
And as the thirsty heart
desires the water brokes:
Even so my soul O God,
does long and look for thee:
Ay me (alas) when shall I come
my Savior sweet to see?
An old verse.
Quod sibi quisque serit: praesentis tempore vitae:
Hoc sibi messis erit, cum dicitur, ite, venite.
In English thus.
WHat so each mortal man does sow:
While he on earth does bide and stay:
Such he again shall reap and mow:
When it is said, aproche, away.
Otherwise.
WHat so each sowes while he,
in earth his race does run:
Such shall his harvest be,
when it is said, go, come.
To an Epicure.
WHat profits pleasure thee to day:
if all to morrow fail?
Ah wretched caitife, ah alas,
what does one day avail.
A letter written to T. w. gent. when he was scoller in Oxford.
PEnelope that pearlesse piece
of whom you often reed:
Did never love Ulysses so
as I do you indeed.
For why a thousand things there are
which you have done for me:
That if I should live Nestors years
could scant requited be.
But yet I trust my chance may change
the proverb old does say:
The weak may stand the strong insted:
a dog may have a day.
Till time that fortune turn her wheell
till things do go aright:
Accept my Wilmer will in worth
till wealth may debt requite.
On Saturday I will you send
some Lessons for your Lute:
And for your Citterne eke a few:
take leaves till time of fruit.
And thus I end desiring you
to let my letter ly
Locked up in coffer close that none
the same but you may spy.
For like as scriblers loath to have
good Scriueners view their lines
So practisers mislike to have
good Poets read their rimes.
Farewell my friend, and see you send
a letter back again:
So shall I think I well did spend
my paper, pen, and pain.
Verses written to his father when he was scholar in Aeton. Scripsit admodum
puer.
WHat merit parents, such
as do their children set
To school, whereby they may
both wealth and wisdom get.
If such deserve (as sure they do)
Perpetual praise and fame:
Then doutles you, O Father deer,
do merit even the same.
Of Love.
Love works woonders great,
strange things it bringes to pass:
It makes of a prudent man
a very doltish ass.
Of Boner, and his brothers.
Foul Boner with his cursed crew,
that loved so the Pope:
Did diverse plague and punish, with
the rod, the rack, and rope.
But (God be thanked) now their force,
does faulter, fade, and fail:
Their rods are spent, their rackes are rent,
their ropes no more prevail.
Of Pope Alexander. 6.
HIs Christ, his keys* and altars all,
does Alexander sell:
Which he may do of right, and why?
before they cost him well.
To one of a diverse and strange nature.
Sometime a lowryng look thou have,
sometime a laughyng face:
Now waspishe, wa^ward: to do ought
willing an other space.
Mournful now, merry anon:
now surly, sullen, sad,
Powtyng: pleasant anon again,
perte, iollie, iocunde, glad.
Thou both art like Democrit, and
Heraclitus beside:
No man without thee can remain,
nor with thee well abide.
Of the works of Poets.
AS in a pleasant grove,
or goodly garden ground:
Among sweet smellyng flowers,
some stinkyng weeds are found.
Like so in Poets plottes,
both good and bad is sown:
Be wary therefore, choose the best,
and let the worste alone.
How to get the love, both of God and men.
WHo leaves, who loves, who lives, who lends:
who spares, who spies, who speaks, who spends,
Shall purchase to himself the love,
of men beneath, and God above.
Exposition.
WHo leaves to lead a loathsome life:
Who loves the Lazor poor to feed,
Who lives in love, and hates strife:
Who lends who lackes, and stands in ne^de.
Who spares to spend, and waxes wise,
Who spies the bait, and shu^nes the hooks
Who speaks the truth, and hates lies:
Who spends his time in sacred books.
Him God himself in heaven above:
And men beneath shall like and love.
A similitude, of Idleness.
AS water clear and clean corrupts,
and stinkes by standing still:
So sluggishe slothe does slaie the soul,
and eke the body spill.
What thing he fears most.
NO stabbyng glaue, nor stickyng knife,
Nor darte dread I, that reueth life.
No Fencers skill, no thrustyng pricks,
No thunderyng threats of despirat Dicks.
No chillyng cold, no scaldyng heat,
No grashyng chaps of monsters great.
No plague, no deadly vile desease,
No broilyng blaze, no swallowyng seas.
No gaulyng greefes, no cares that crushe,
Of these I recke not of a Rushe.
An ill there is which does remain,
That troubles more and putts to pain:
A fawnyng friend most mischief is,
Which seeks to kill yet semes to kiss.
How the xij. signs do govern and rule in man's body.
THe Ram is Rex, and rules,
above in hedde and face:
The neck and throat the Bull,
possesses for his place.
In arms and shoulders both,
the Twins do reign and rest:
The Crab is king, and keeps
the stomach, lungs, and breast.
The Lion king of beasts,
does bide in back and heart:
The Virgin has the gutts
and belly for her part.
In reins, and lusty loins,
the Ballaunce bears swaie:
Among the secret parts,
the Scorpion still does stay.
The Archer has the thighs,
and Capricorn the knees:
The legs the Watermannes,
the feet the Fishes fees.
Commendation and praise of Virtue.
BY riches none are happy made,
for riches slide away:
Though got with sweat and labor great,
at length yet they decaie.
Faint faultryng fumblyng feeble age
decreaseth sturdie strength:
Health sickness quails: and beauty brave
does flittyng fade at length.
Sweet ticklyng pleasure tarries not,
nor makes any stay:
But in an hour, a little time,
does vanishe quight away.
But Virtue fair adornes the mind,
and perfect does remain:
She steadfast bides, and never slides,
and naught may Virtue stain.
No time can Virtue fair deface,
she after death endures:
And us above the clustryng clouds,
a place with God procures.
Virtue does make us blessed, and
a happy end does give:
And when we rotten bones remain,
yet Virtue makes us live.
The covetous carle, compared to a Mule.
THe churlishe chuffe, that has enough
in Coffer locked and laid:
And lives hard, with Baken ^warde,
a Mule may well be said.
Mules carry coi^e, and iewelles often,
plate, gold, and rich arraie,
Great treasure: yet they droylyng drudge,
and feed on homely haie.
To a friend.
Live as a man, persist in doing well:
Endeuouryng aye, all others to excel.
Christ speaks.
THe air, the earth, the seas, the woods,
and all shall once away:
Alone my word shall still remain,
and (standing steadfast) stay.
To himself.
WHat likes thy mind or fancy best?
what do thou most desire?
Do covet costly buildyngs brave?
or riches do require?
I force not these: what then wilt have?
great store of land to ear?
Kings pleasures? or delightst thou in
fine princely dainty cheer?
If these should like me, I should like,
with toil and care to be:
For rest and riches make no match,
they hardly do agree.
As Irus I should live, though I
whole kingdoms had in hold:
And Cre^us though I did enjoy,
thy heaps of hourded gold.
Bare, naked, came I hither, and
nakt shall I hence again:
Why therefore should I care for aught,
or put my self to pain?
Inioye and mirthe I Will spend my time,
and naught shall me anoye:
I Will laugh to scorn, the mucke, the moulde,
which worldlyngs rich enjoy.
What? carest thou for nothing then?
yes, this of God I crave:
That still I may a quiet mind,
and healthful body have.
To one so given to go brave. That at last he left himself like a slave.
WIth brave outlandishe strange araie,
you (lusty) long were clad:
And sundry suits of sundry sorts,
for sundry times you had.
Sometime French fashions pleased you best:
sometime the Spanishe guise:
In costly colors cuttyng still,
you went with staryng eyes.
But now at last you royste in rags,
rude, rogishe, rent and torn:
What fashion this? or whose? declare
is this beyond sea worn?
To one that made his bragges that he was nosed like unto king Cirus.
THou say thou art hauknosed right,
so as king Cirus was:
Say to thou have king Midas ears,
who earde was like an Ass.
Of money and land.
THis silver, coin, and money, what?
ruste, though it glad:
Possessions, land, and living, what?
duste, even as bad.
Learning,
Learning does all things far surpass,
naught Learning may excel:
What profit comes to man thereby,
ne pen, ne tongue may tell:
A spur to youth, that pricketh forth
fair Virtue to obtain:
To crooked age a great delight,
and sollace sweet again:
A rock and refuge for the wretch,
and for the needy poor:
And to the rich and wealthy wight,
of substance greater store.
Of Time.
Time brings lurking things to light,
time secrets does bewray:
The privy pilferyng prigging thief,
time does in time betraie.
Of Dice.
THe cursed play of deuelish Dice,
The daughter vile of avarice:
The plague of love and amity:
The very nurse of theuerie:
The excersise of fury fell:
And last the pathway plain to hell.
Of women, water, and wine.
WIne, women, water, each
does hurt, and put to pain:
Wine, women, water, each
does help, and ease again.
Of wemens lightness.
WHat more then Feathers light,
dry leaves, and withered grass?
Yet these in lightness women do
surmount and far surpass.
Again of the same.
WHat thing is lighter then the flame?
bright lightnyng. what is thought
Then lightning lighter? wind. then wind?
women. then women? naught.
Of the misery of man.
WE weping come into the world:
and weping hence we go:
And all our life is nothing else,
but grief, pain, toil, and woe.
To his uncle: HENRY KENDALL.
MY triflyng toys you joy to read
and what my Muse does write:
My Muse (deer uncle) joys again
of you for to indite.
If you mine only prop do slip,
my Muse remains slow:
The silver Swan does seldom sing
but Zephir mild does blow.
Of the Poet Lucan.
Foul moody Mars his blustryng broils,
to see with cunnyng pend
Who longs, let him his listening ear
to learned Lucan lend.
So well his works, do martial feats
and warlike deeds express:
As noble Tullie^ books bewray
the fruits of pleasant peace.
As quiet peace is to be wished,
and Tully to be red:
So Lucan he that writes of war
ought not for to be fled.
Christ.
WHo dies in Christ, does live: who lives
in Christ, from death is free:
Where Christ does present still appear
there death can never be.
Gold, not God, regarded now adays.
THis age hunts all for hateful coin,
for pomp and glory vain:
Addicted none to God, and Good,
but all to Gold, and Gain.
Of himself.
THe Bow that bended stands still,
his strength will loose and lack:
The lusty horse is lamd, with to
much burden on his back.
But I, let fortune spit her spite,
and spurnyng still disdain.
Will (God to friend) contented bide
and steadfast still remain.
Remedies against love.
Loves rigorous rage, or abstinence
or tamyng time restraines:
If these do miss, for remedy
alone a rope remains.
To all men.
SHun man, shun (oh) soul slaiyng sin,
serve God unto thy grave:
Foul filthy foolish faulty folk
the finds of hell shall have.
Of Dearh.
THe regal king and crooked clown
all one, alike, Death drives down.
Death spares no kind.
NO state in earth we see,
but draws to decay:
The Lion made at last,
to smallest birds a pray.
Who rich, who poor.
RIch who? who cares for naught,
and is with small content.
Poor who? coin caring carles
to pelf and paultry bent.
Labor killes love.
IF that in toil and taking pain,
thy pleasure thou do put:
The fire does die, fond fancies fly:
Cupidos comb is cut.
The more a man has, the more he desires.
AS riches rise, man's nature is,
to grope and gape for more:
Men covet most, when as their bags,
be cramd and stuffed with store.
To Jesus Christ.
IF ever we thou love,
I joyful am for aie:
If ever me thou leave,
my soul does sorrow stay.
If ever me thou love,
thrice happy then am I:
If ever me thou leave,
then (out alas) I dye.
If ever me thou love,
abound I do in bliss:
If ever me thou leave,
then all thing do I miss.
If ever thou me love,
who then as I so glad?
If ever me thou leave,
then who as I so sad?
If ever me thou love,
thou ever makst me live:
If ever me thou leave,
deaths dart thou do me give.
If ever me thou love,
who lives so glad as I?
If ever me thou leave,
who dies so bad as I?
If ever me thou love,
in heaven thou makst me dwell:
If ever me thou leave,
thou driust me down to hell.
Wherefore O loving Lord,
love still to make me live:
So shall I never leave,
thee laud and praise to give.
Of Pope Julius. 3.
WEll tipled at the table once
with drink, when Julius sat:
(A man whom wicked Rome her self,
did spite, abhor, and hate.)
As it is said three boles at once,
for him were ready made:
That he three burdens might at once,
in vessels three unlade.
The first of all the vessels three,
he filde with vomit vile:
The next with piss, the other he,
with ordure did defile.
No man can do two things at once,
the proverb old does tell:
This was a passing Pope I trow,
that could do three so well.
To Zoilus.
Bark Zoilus till thy beallie break:
Of railyng thine I will not reake.
Of an Astrnomer, and a Plowman.
A King sometime determined,
an huntyng for to ride:
Of diverse persons did demand,
what weather would betide.
A student in Astronomy,
(there standing by) did tell
It would be fair, so that his grace,
might ride on huntyng well.
A Plowman poor unto the Prince,
began thus reply again:
Believe him not sur, bide at home,
for sure I cham twull rain.
The king did laugh, (...) at last
all business set aside*
The king with troup, and all his train,
does forth on huntyng ride.
Not entered scant the wood, but strait
upon the trees did dashe.
A powryng shower that paid them all,
and well the king did wash.
The prince the Plowman praisde: and said
look thou where Stars do stand
Poor Plowman: and proud Strologer,
take thou a whip in hand.
The like Astronomers to this
we have in England here:
More fitter for to till, then tell,
except they wiser were.
To Zoilus.
WHo has bestowd upon thy browe,
a garlande brave of Baie?
Such as can clime Parnassus mount,
those leaves should deck alwaie.
To scoffers Zoilus such as thou,
and such as styng with tongue:
To stingers such a stingyng crown,
of Nettelles does belong.
Of Zenabon.
WHile Zenabon unhappy man,
did Venus pleasures prove:
His members vile were whipped away,
by her whom he did love.
Anacharsis the Philosophers saying.
LIke as ye webs which spiders spin ye see,
By subtle slight ^^^^angle, take, and tie,
The feeble small and sooly ^hiftes be,
And let the bigger break away, and fly.
Like so the laws the ^ower, mean, and poor,
Do plague, and (...), and make to pay:
The noble man, or ^oche enjoying store
With small ado quight scotfree escape away.
Otherwise, and shorter.
AS Cobwebs catch the lesser flies,
and let the greater go:
So those of power, and not the poor
the Laws do favor show.
Precepts written to HENRY KNEVET gent.
H Hurt not thy fo, help still thy friend:
E Endure like DAMON to the end.
N Neglect not virtue: vice eschew:
R Reward the good with guerdon due.
I In peace delight: foul discord fly:
E Eat so to live, live so to dye.
K Know thou thy self: soul slaiyng sin,
N Nip in the head, ere it begin.
E Endeavor not to clime to hye:
V Use not the needy to deny.
E Exalt the hiest with praises often:
T That thou may mount the skies aloft.
Precepts written in his friend RICHARD WOODWARDS prayer book, sometime his
companion in OXFORD.
R Refrain from sin,
I In virtue grow:
C Care for thy friend,
H Hate not thy foe:
A Abandon vice,
R Regard the wise:

Of four Beasts and the Spider.
THe Boar in hearing us does pass,
the Ape in taste, the Linx in sight:
In smell the Gripe, in fealing quick
the Spider goes beyond us quight.
Ite, Venite.
GO, ah a griping word will be,
but Come, a golden glad:
Come shall be said toth blessed good,
Go to the curssed bad.
Of the vanity of this world,
WHat profits pomp and glory of
the world so wicked vain?
Since after death we crumbling dust
and rotten bones remain.
To Zoilus.
The Fem, the Flood, the Flame
three mischefes Zoilus be:
But Zoile thy tongue a mischefe worse
then these repeated three.
Of him that marryes twice.
HIs first wife dead, and said in grave,
who does a second seek:
Unto a momishe mariner,
and shipman he is leeke.
Who having book his bark and escaped,
with perrill great and pain:
The surgyng swallowyng swellyng seas
assayes and tries again.
Of a wife.
TO combersome a clog
a wife is unto man:
She never does him good,
nor profits him, but when
She dies, and leaves to tread
this toylsome worldly path:
And leueth in her sted
the gold she hoorded has.
The same and shorter.
A Husband of his wife
has never proffit, save
When she does leave her goods behind
and goes herself toth grave.
Beauty and Virtue seldom coupled.
WHhere amerous beauty brave does bide
does virtue seld abound:
The canker couchyng commonly
in fairest rose is found.
How the Papist prays.
THe Papist prays with mouth, his mind
on gatheryng woolle does go:
Like to a iabberyng Ape, which does
naught else but mumpe and mow.
Who takes the pains, the profit gains.
WHo crackes the Nut, the kernel finds,
the taste the sweet that sweat:
The lasie Lurden lives in lack,
and nothing has to eat.
Who poor.
THe wight that lives in want, is not
to be accounted poor:
But he that swimmes in plenty rich,
and yet desires more.
To one that married a foul wife for riches.
THy wife is foul, deformed, black:
but storde with coin is she:
Thou marriedst for thy hands to feel,
not for thine eyes to see.
Of Wine.
WIne makes men sad, and febles for^e,
wine makes strong and glad:
If to much taken be thereof,
if that a mean be had.
Of Physicians.
THree faces the Physician has:
first as an Angel he*
When he is saught: next when he helps,
a God he semes to be.
And last of all when he has made,
the sick deseased well
And asks his guerdon, then he semes
an ougly Fiend of hell.
To an unskillful Physician.
AChilles with a sword did slaie his foes.
Thou killest with a herb on ground yt grows
Thee worthier then Achilles I suppose.
Of a Fish, a Swallowe, and an Hare, shot through at one shoot. an uncertain
Author.
AN Hare to shun the gredie Grewnde,
that did him ferce pursue:
Lepte in a river, thinkyng so,
to bid the Dog adue.
An Archer by beholding this,
with Bow there ready bent:
(In hope to hit him as he swam)
an Arrowe at him sent.
By hap a Swallowe skirde between,
withal up lept a Roche:
And so the Hare, the bird, the fish,
his shafte at once did broche.
To the Rechlesse route.
NO longer linger, leave delaie:
time swifte away does run:
Repent betyme, no man knows when,
the latter day shall come.
Of Wiuyng.
A Marryng for to marry, still
thus all men all do say:
Thus say they still, yet wittyngly,

Time does all.
THe huge great Oak was once a plant,

And famous learned Cicero,

Be advised ere thou speak.
THe word that once has past thy lips,

Aduisde be therefore how thou speakst,
to whom, what, where, and when.
To one furious and full of Pride.
IF Seneca of ancient time,

But this I know my Kneuet sure,

Idem est pauperibus, diuitibusque Deus.
THe beggars, and the biggers birth,

As dear to God the selie swain,

To Marks a marker of faults.
Marks, mark what I shall say to thee,

If Marks thou mark me any more,

To the Pope.
THy heart is on thy halfpenie,
horse, harlotts, hawks and hounds:
No recknyng of Religion made,
where vice so much abounds.
To a sweet mouthed minion.
Each curious cate, each costly dishe,
your dainty tooth must taste:
Ne lickes, ne likes, your lips the meat,
where pleasure none is plaste.
Fine venzon fat must be your food,
Lark, Partridge, Plouer, Quail:
A likerishe lip, a likerishe lap,
as tongue is, so is tail.

Nouembris. 17. 1558
A Rhyme against ROME.
ROme covetous for coin does call:
She empties coffer, pouche and all.
If thou do let thy purse alone,
From Pope and patriarchs thence be gone.
But if with pence thou plie them still,
And if their chests with coin thou fill,
Absolve they will and pardon thee,
How faulty foul so ere thou be.
Ho, God be here: whose there?
a maid.
What comst thou for? to crave
your aid.
Have coin? naie croslesse clean:
then keep thee there:
I have: how much? enough:
then come thou nere.
To one named Love.
I Love the Love, my love:
love me my love therefore:
And when I leave to love my love,
then let me live no more.
To a common Bragger.
THou sturdie calst thy self: but thou
can better farte, then fight:
Put S away, and what thou art,
thou then declarest right.
A pretty similitude.
LIke as the beggar hides his skin,
where it is fair and white:
And will not open any place,
that whole may seem to sight.
But contrary his loathsome soars,
he shows for men to vewe:
His bloody cloutes, and rotten rags,
that all might on him rewe.
So ne should we of our good deeds,
or brag or boaste at all
Before the Lord, but show our sins,
and so for mercy call.
Of a certain Ruffian.
A Smithfield Ruffian in a fray
as feircely he did fight:
Was of the hand that held his sword,
by sword dispatched quight.
Which whipped away (in such a sort)
as soon as he did see:
Flingyng his dagger at his fo,
nay then take all said he.
Of a certain Ciuilian.
THou calst thy self Ciuilian,
thou art not full so much:
If Ci. be out, as then remains
in deed thy name is such.
Of a Lawyer.
THou say thou art a Lawyer:
the letters two next L
Put out: and then the rest declares
thy name and nature well.
To one that said he was a Lawyer almost.
THou say thou art a Lawier
almost: thou do not jest:
Put letters two next L. away
and then thou art the rest.
Again, of a Lawyer.
THou say that for Lawier,
then thee none may be better:
Nor none so good (say I) put out
the third and second letter.
Ridyng by the way with a gentleman, and being Demanded by him, the difference
between their horses, he thus answered extempore.
THe difference do thou ask
between thy horse and mine?
What difference twixt a ioltyng Jade
and Palfray amblyng fine.
Written to a friend, in his extreme sickness.
MY Titus if thou have thy health,
then shall I greatly Joy:
As for my self, I am in health,
if health be sick anoye.
I pine (God help) in fever fallen:
a wretch of wretches I:
Farewell, unless the highest help
my days are done, I dye.
An Epitaph upon the death of M. Ihon Bradford.
NO Scholar ought or must,
above his master be:
Who so does serve, and honor God,
great troubles suffers he.
Each son the Lord does love,
he beats and scourges ay:
Unpleasant, hard, and strait the path
to heaven that leads the way.
These sayings, blessed Bradford, while
thou did reuolue in mind:
The thundryng threats of wicked wights,
their cruelties unkind,
Their flatteries fair, their force, their fraud,
thou nothing did set by:
But did yield up with willing heart
thy Corpse in fire to fry.
A prancke of Pope Julius 3. about a Peacocke.
A Certain Pope that Julius hight,
at dinner on a time,
Upon his table placed had,
a dainty Peacocke fine.
Which though it were a dainty dishe,
he could not tutche as then:
Wherefore, go take this same away,
he said unto his men,
And keep it cold till supper time.
and see in Garden fair
I suppe at night, for unto me
as then will guests repair.
When Supper time approached was,
among his sumptuous meat
And Peacockes whot, his Peacocke cold
he saw not there to eat.
Wherefore he began to lowre, and powt,
to sweat, to swell, to swear:
Such thundering threatenings throwing out
that all amazed were.
A Cardnall by beholding this,
entreatyng him began say:
O holy father be content,
and this your anger stay.
Indeed your waiters worthy are,
for to be chid and shent:
But since it was against their wills,
let pass and be content.
Then Julius Pope with fomyng mouth
and flashing fiery eyes:
In angry mood, as he were mad,
began answer in this wise.
If God for apple only one,
so angry were quoth he:
That he expeld from Paradise,
our Parents, he, and she.
Why may not I his Vicar here,
be movd to anger then
For this same bird: better this bird
then apples ten and ten.
Although this Pope with Peacockes flesh
lovd still to cram his craw:
Yet for a Peacock thus to rage,
he showd him self a daw.
To a certain friend.
Sometimes in London thou do live:
sometimes in Country soil:
In Cambridge now and then: sometimes
in Court thou keepst a coile.
Leave rangyng thus: cease thus thy self
still to and fro to toss:
The restless stone, that rowleth still,
does seldom gather moss.
Written under the picture of M. Thomas Becon.
Lo reader here, his portrature,

The dowments of his mind divine,
which pen might not displaie
Nor Painter paint, him self does by
his learned works bewraie.
Of the picture of Thomas Cranmer, sometime worthy Archbishop of Canterbury.
LEarned thou wast, and godly both,
while Cranmer thou did live:
A happy and a happlesse life,
unto thee God did give.
Of his own picture.
MY front well framd the Painter has,
which he beheld with eye:
My heart is known, to God alone,
which holds the heavens on hye.
Again.
MY browe the Painter has expressed:
God knows the secrets of my breast.
Of four living creatures, that live by the four Elements.
THe beast Camilion lives by air,

In waves to live, the Mole in mould,

A saying of S. Ciprian.
They which do love them selves to paint,
with colors strange and gaie:
They have to fear that God nill know,

An other saying of S. Cyprian.
THe leude which love to paint their locks
with red and yellowe fine:
They do prognosticate, but how

An old saying.
AN Hunters breakfast cheifest is,
a Lawiers dinner best:
Monks drinkyngs, Merchants suppers fine
surmount and pass the rest.
Of Lacon.
WHy Lacon did thou choose thy wife,
(quoth one) so feate and small?
To choose the lest, I hold it best,
(quoth he) of euells all.
Thinkyng on the latter day.
IF every man and woman would,
think on the latter day:
Then men would mende, and women would,
the wantons cease to play.
Please, Praise, and Pray.
BE sure not long the world will last,
Please, Praise, and Pray therefore:
Pray to the Lord, him praise and please,
and care thou for no more.
Five things white.
Four things are wondrous white, ye fifte
shines more then all the rest:
Snow, silver, Ceruse, hoarie hears,
a chaste unspotted breast.
Three things detestable.
THree things are detestable, vile:
a beggar proud and hye:
An old man leude and lecherous:
a rich man that does lie.
Three things not to be lent.
THree things a man not lends rife:
his horse, his fighting sword, his wife.
Three things should not be forgotten.
THree things should be remembered,
and printed still in breast.
Good turns recevd, good precepts pure,
and those that are deceast.
Of Mark miserable, that hanged himself.
MArk miser yesterday I hard,
the hanging craft would try:
And under three pence (caitif wretch)
no Halter could he buy.
I buy no Ropes so dear (quoth he)
the price amazd the elfe,
For two pence halfpeny he agrees
at last, and hangs himself.
Of saying grace.
WHo sittyng down does take his meals,
And thanks not God in grateful wise:
Goes as a brutishe Ox to board,
And rudely like an Ass does rise.
The Best are hated of the Bad.
THe ougsum owl Jove's bird does hate,
the lothsum Ape does spite
The Lion king, the carren Crow
the Swan fair, silver white.
To the carpyng Corrector.
WIth kitish eyes thou can decerne,

But when thou should correct thine own,

A Seemly thing in hand I am,
old age uphold I right.
I rule the steps, I fear the dog,
I ease the weary wight.
The saying of BIAS.
BEhold thy self in Glass,
and if so fair thou be:
Then do thou fair and honest things
as best beseems thee.
But if deformed, foul,
and lothely thou appear:
Requite that foul deformity,
by manners fair and clear.
To a friend.
WHen fishes shun the silver streams:
When darkness yeldes bright Titans beams.
When as the bird that Phoenix hight,
Shall have ten thousand mates in sight.
When Jove in Limbo low shall lie,
And Pluto shall be plast on hye:
Then I will thee forsake my dear,
And not before, as shall appear.
The torment of Turnecotes.
IN readyng once a certain book
called Pasquin in a trance:
To find the turnecotes torment there,
by turnyng it was my chance.
Such as will ne hold with the hare,
nor yet run with the hound:
Such as like waueryng whethercocks,
with every blast turn round.
Such as with nether, hic, nor haec,
do love to be declinde:
But still with hoc, like neuters naught,
that turn with every wind.
These faines he to be fast with cord,
between two pillars bound:
About the mids, so that they hang,
and can not tutche the ground.
Upon their heads a pair of Hearts
huge horns are surely fixed:
Having a sail of linen cloth
their hidious horns betwixt.
And at their heels there hangs a bag,
with coin and money stuffed:
So turn these turnecotes whirlyng round
with every little puffed.
For as the wind does rise and blow,
and strike the stremyng sail:
Their heels are heavd on hie to heaven,
then each turns up his tail.
And as the wind does cease to blow,
and quiet does remain:
Then does the ponderous poundstone purse
bring down their feet again.
So are these wretches whirld about,
and now their heads on hye:
And straight their heels are heued up
unto the lofty sky.
Translated out of Theocritus.
CVpido Venus dearlyng defte,
to sweet his lips with mell
Sore longyng, came unto an Hiue,
where Bees did shroude and dwell.
And mindyng now with Honey sweet,
to fill his belly full
He thrusts his hand into the Hiue,
and fast begins to cull.
The Bees bestirre them, by and by,
and pricked him with their styngs:
Deft Cupid doleful does depart,
and takes him to his wings.
He stamps, he stares, he takes on:
he knows not what to do:
At last with tinglyng stynged hand,
he comes his mother to.
And thus beginns to make his moan:
ah mother, mother mine:
The Be most vile and pestilent,
has kilde Cupido thine.
Ah, out alas, what shall I do?
I never would have thought
The selie simple shiftlesse Be,
could have such mischief wrought.
Quoth Venus smilyng: what? alas,
and does it grieve you so?
Content your self, you are but small,
yet how you strike you know.
Precepts written to his Cosen Paul Tooley.
P PVre toward thy friend persevere still:
A Avoid all anger that is ill.
V Upon the poor thine alms bestow:

T Talk little, hear much: tell truth:
O Obey thy better: bridle youth.
O Obtain the love of great and small:
L Look on the Scriptures, ponder Paul.
E Earne, learn to live, with life and lim:
Y Yield praise to God, and pray to him.
To all render: Youths and young scholars.
IF learning you neglecte, in age
you will cry, ah alas,
Why did I not to study stick,
in childhoode while I was.
A young scholars Poesy.
Leave play, and love learning:
For fear of stripes earnyng.
Verses written at the request of his Cosen MARY PALMER, in her prayer book
called THE POMANDER OF PRAYER.
Make much of modesty: be always meke:
Abandon vice: for golden virtue seek.
Regard the good: the ill set nothing by:
In mind remember still that thou must die
Please parents thine: persist in doing well:
Ay strive to stain the rest: and to excel.
Live, learn, and love: and always know thy self:
Muse al on heaven: pass small on worldly pelf.
Endeavor at the narrow gate to enter in:
Rule so thy self immortal feign to win.
To one that called him Spendall.
THou spend all do me call: I grant
much coin I spend perdie:
But thou do spend thy self on whores,
thou spendest more then I.
To a Niggard that called him unthrift.
THou say I spend all, spend all still,
and nothing use to purse:
Thou pursest all, and spendest naught:
I ill do: thou do worse.
To a certain friend.
THou spend all do me call:
thou calst me rendall to:
I spend, rende, nothing mende thou say,
yes sure, I mende my shoo.
The nature of the Hernshew.
THe Hearnshew though she hau^t ye brooks,
and rivers eke that run:
Yet rain and tempest she abhorres,
and seeks the same to shun
By soryng up and mounting hie:
she shrowdyng still does rest
A loft in tops of tallest trees,
and there does make her nest.
She shuns her foe the Goshawke great,
and Hawks of other kind:
Her hates and plagues the Hauk again,
when that he can her find
When as the Hawk and Hernshew fight,
and strive aloft in sky:
For this one thing, with might of wing,
both strive especially
Who may above the other get:
if Hawke have highest place
With earnest flight he conquers quight,
the Hernshew in short space.
But if the Hernshew highest get,
she squirtyng down does cast
Her dirt and dunge, the Hawke upon*
and spoils him so at last.
Four properties of the dog.
Four propertyes praiseworthy sure,
are in the dog to note:
He keeps the house, he fears the thief
by barking with his throat.
He plays well the Physician,
with lickyng tongue he cures:
Unto his master still he sticks,
and faithful fast endures.
Of Boner.
OF Bishops al, the best some did thee call:
Indeed thou wast the beast of bishops all.
To a naughty Lawier.
Would have me tell what law thou have?

An old said saw, need has no law.
no more have thou indeed.
Translated out of an Italian writer.
LYcoris in her bosom bears,
two Apples fair that shine:
Again two Strawberries she bears,
in bosom hers divine.
Her bourly breasts two apples be,
her nipples be two berries:
Her apples shine as white as snow,
Her nipples red as cherries.
Love came and sucked her tender breasts
and said, now milk farewell:
My mothers breasts with milk do strowt,
but these with Nectar swell.
AENIGMATA. Nix.
MOre white I am then plume of Swan:
Daughter of Winter cold I am.

The letter first take from my name,
And nine in number thou do frame.
If this word COR thou ad to me:

A Red skin glisteryng me does hide,

In stead of heart I hold a stone,

WIth Lime together linkt am I,

And eke most filthy Leacher vile.
if P thou take away:
With horns I pushe: walls down I rushe:

The Snaile.
BOnelesse and footlesse quight am I,
and quight deuoide of hear:

but what my horns do bear.
Where so I go, or where I touch,
I leave a filthy slime:
Salt frettyng, does me sore annoye:
the tallest tower I clime.
A Tennice ball.
WIthout, without here smothe I am,
yet full of hear within:
Round like a Boule: though feet I want,
to run I do not lin.
Although fine feathers light I lack,
yet mount I do alofte:
And look when I am stricken, then
my strength repair I often.
Vespertilio.
OF Euenyng dark my name I take:
my wings are made of skin:
As other birds I am not clothde
with feathers light and thin.
I only bring forth young: alone
my duggs with milk do swell:
All other birds want teeth, with teeth
but I am fenced well.
The Comb.
ADornde with teeth on every side,
I framed am of box:
Let baldepate me forbear to use:
I part the kangled locks.
Castanea.
IN forest fair I grow:
eight letters spells my name:
Take three the last away, and so

Of four birds, signifiyng the four quarters of the year.
THe Chaffinch shows when winter comes*
which synges in Winter cold:
When chittering Swallowe does return,

The Cuckoo chauntes in Summer time,
when all things glister green:
The bird that hights Ficedula,
in Autumn still is seen.
To the Reader
TAke in good part these triflyng toys,
good Reader which I write:
When as I was a boy with boys,
these toys I did indite.
Tushe, tushe, they foolish are thou say:

But where are thy wise wondrous works,

To his Cosen IHON KENDALL.
MY Kendall cosen dear and friend,
all things kend of thee be:
Of thee the Scriptures all are kend.

He which knows all, and knows not Christ
naught knows he: this is plain:
Ken all of Christ, which is the hiest,
and count the rest as vain.
To his dear brother IHON SHEPPARD gent. of Grayes Inn.
MY brother dear, my hope, my chere,
my trusty Sheppard true:
The surest Sheppard I can find
among the Sheppards crew.
By name thou art a Sheppard sure
a Sheppard eak in deed:
A happy Sheppard I thee find
to me in all my need.
So long as thou my Sheppard art,
in lack I can not live:
To pasture green, by pleasant brokes,
thou daily do me drive.
Thou plaist the part of pastor pure,
thou keepst me in the way:
Thou will not let me wander wild
in wilderness astray.
Thou will not let me set my foot,
in Popish path to tred:
Thou do abhor as Plutos Pit
his mitred monsters head.
Persist good brother in the race,
thou have begun to run:
Serve God so as thou daily do,
the snares of Satan shun.
Fight like a valiant Sheppard stout,
against the Woulfe of hell:
Feed like a Pastor pure the poor,
so as thou have done well.
So shall the Lord be Sheppard thine,
and pay thee double twice:
And bring thee to the pasture pure,
of princely paradise.

An EPITAPHE upon the death of his dear Mother, ALSE KENDALL. Which died and

LO here she lies, whose honest life
perpetual praise deservd:
Lo here she lies, whose life well led
from virtue never swervde.
Lo here she lies, which livd in love
still with her linked feer:
Lo here she lies, which while she livd
still held her children deer.
Lo here she lies, which lovd her friend,
and hated not her fo.
Lo here she lies, that was belovd
of all sorts, hye and low.
Lo here she lies, that always lovd
her neighbor as her self:
Lo here she lies, that more esteemd

Lo here she lies, which hated lies,

Lo here she lies, which gave the poor,

For fine, in few wilt have declarde
of every man the mind?
Here lies ALICE KENDALL worthy wife,

Here lies her bones, hard crushed with stones
in life lame were her lims:
Now dead, her soul in silver stremes

An Epitaphe upon the death of his dear father, William Kendall: which died
(being cut of the stone) and lies buried at Northaston in Oxford shire.
HEre lies he dead, with stones oppressed,
whom stones oppressed in life:
Aye me that he was forste to dye,
by dint of deadly knife.
Woe worth the wretch that ripped his flesh:
yet wretch why say I so?
Since needs he would such torments try,
to end his pain and woe.
The life he lidve, was sure no life,
but even a death in life:
And therefore pluckyng pangs he provde,
of cutters caruyng knife.
He thought by pluckyng pinchyng pangs,
to end his pinyng pains:
He thought to rid the ragged stone,
that tide him so in chains.
But (out alas) he rid his life,
(oh grisly gripyng greef)
He was dispatched of his life,
and I of my releef.
Ah farewell father mine most dear,
in earth we part with pain:
Northaston wants thee, wailes and wepes,
wishyng for thee again.
We want and wish: we wail and weep:
we mourn (alas) and miss:
Thou ne do mourn, nor missest ought,
now plaste in heavenly bliss.
My loss I do lament: and yet
I joy for gain of thine:
I lost a father, thou have gainde
perpetual joys divine.
An Epitaph upon the death of his dear aunt ELLEN KENDALL: which died, and
lies buried at BLOXAM.
HEre Ellen lies lapt up in earth:
which always liude to dye,
And died to live, to live again
in lastyng joys on hye.
Aye me when (wretch) I first began live,
then began she life to leave:
I thought to reap great joy by her,
but she did me deceive.
She more esteemde of heaven then earth
and therefore God did give
Heaven unto her: she hopte for heaven,
now she in heaven does live.
Ah farewell Aunte, thou gauste me life:
I sukte thy tender breast:
Thou did rock me, when a babe
in cradle I did rest.
And have I lost thee now so sone?
no force: great is thy gain:
In heaven we shall with pleasure meet,
though here we part with pain.
Still diddst thou live the Lord to love,
and thou did love to live
Still with the Lord: and now the Lord
unto thee life does give.
Lo, LIVE AND LOVE: this lesson learn,
you that in earth remain:
That when you leave to live, you may
obtain to live again.
THRENODIA.
A sorrowful Sonet upon the death of Walter, late Earl of Essex.
THe Primrose cheef of princely peers,
the Star of England bright:
The Prince of perfect piety,
the Diamonde of delight.
O dogged Death by direful darte,
from England thou have refte:
Our sollace thou have ta^e away,
and us in sorrow left.
We loathe to live, and yet we love
to live, alone for this:
That we may wail this worthies want,
whom we so sore do miss.
Ah farewell Earl most excellent,
for thee does England weep:
The Prince, the peers, the people shreke,
in Death to see thee sleep.
Thy corpse is clapped in cloddes of claie,
thy soul is soard on hye:
With saints above the clusteryng clouds
to pearche perpetually.
Post cineres, virtus viuere sola facit.
Imprinted at LONDON in Paul's Church yard, at the Sign of the Brazen
Serpent by Ihon Shepperd.
