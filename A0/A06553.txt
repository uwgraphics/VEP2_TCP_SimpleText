Bitwene persons were two or three
Sought out the grounds be records
This was the custom^ of antiquite

The caas conceived stondyng in different
Between parties to give Judgment
Parties assembled of high and low degree

Grounded of their quarrels the law made hem fre
With out excepcion to come in audience

Be titel of right their greues to declare
Upon this matter shortly to conclude
Naught yore agoon as I reherce shall
I fond to purpose a simylitude
Full craftily depeynted upon a wall
Tweyne sittyng in estate royal
The fierce lion famous in all royames
And themperial egle percyng the son^e beams
These were the dredefull Iugges tweyne
In their estate sittyng I took keep
That herd the parties by and by complain
The horse the ghoos and the simple sheep
The process was not to perfound^ ne deep
Of their debate but contryued of a fable
Which of hem was to man most profitable
Each for his party proudly began proceed
To force him self be record of scripture
By philosophers as clerks seen and read
The prerogatives / yeuen hem be nature
Which of these three / to every creature
In re publica / auayleeth most a man
For his party thus first the horse began
*The horse*

To proceed briefly and not long to tarry
First fro the truth that I do not err
What be is found in all thing so necessary
As is the horse both nyghe and far
And so notable to man in pees and werre
Horse in chronicles who so redeth a right
Have saved often many a worthy knight
Marcyall prowess in especyall
God has be horse give to warriors
Record of alisaundre whose horse bucyfall
Made him escape fro many sharp shours
The golden chare of old conquerours
Toward the tryumphe for knyghtly deeds
Conceived hit was with four white stedes
Remember hector the trojan champion
Whose horse was called whilom galathe
Upon whose back he pleyde the lion
Full often fithes he made the greeks flee
The stead of perseus was cleped pigase
With swifte wings / poets seyn the same
Was for his swiftenes named ye horse of fame
Eques ab equo is said of verrey right
And chyualer is said of chyualrye
In duche a rider is called a knight
Aragon tongue does also specifye
C^ualoro / which in that party
Is named of worship and took beginning
Of spores of gold and chiefly of ridyng
These emperors these princes and these kings
When they ben armed in bright plate and mayle
Without horse what were their mustringes
Their broad baners or their rich apparaylle
To fore here enemies to show hem in battle
Without horse. spear. sword. ne shield
Might litell avail for to hold a field
The hardy prykars upon horse back
Be sent to forn what ground is best to take
In their ordenance that there be no lack
Be providence how they the field shall make
An horse wole weep for his master sake
Chaw^er remembrith the swerd. ring and glass
Presented were upon a stead of brass
Between two hills the prophet zacharye
Saw stedes four / the first of hem was read
In chares four the field to magnefye
And the second was black it is no dread
The ^hirde was white body neck and head
The fourth diuerce of colors / wonder strong
And to knyghthode all these colors long
The read horse was token of hard^^^^
Which apperteyneth to every manly knight
The cole black hew a sign of ^^bernesse
Poraylle oppressid to help in their right
The white milk stead that was glad of sight
Tokeneth yt knyghthode treuly should entende
Holy church maidens and wedewis to defend
The many fold colors to speak in general
Be sundry virtues and conditions
As the four virtues called cardynall
Longyng to knyghthod tencrece their renons
In re publica / called the champions
Truth to sustene and show hem self strong
Bound be order to se noman have wrong
With outen horse iustes ne tournayll
May not be hold in werre ne in pees
Nor in palastre no pleyes marcyall
If horse do fail may come to non encrees
Ne noman sothly dar put him in prees
With outen horse for short conclusion
To atteyne the palm of triumphal guerdon
(...) there ben of horse also
Do great prouffit / to every comonte
The plough ne carte might naught do
With out horse / daily ye may see
^yllyng were lost ne were we horses parde
The besy marchante to his auantage
N^^ ships and horse could have no carriage
The ship be liknesse is callid an horse of t^^
Full notably who can understand
To lead men and carye them over the sea
As don horse when they come to land
The pour man eke ledeth in a band
His litell capull. his corn his mele to selle
And when hit is grou^den brings it fro ye melle
In winter season to make beal chere
The horse is nedeful wode and turf to carye
Wyn fruit and oil to serve through the year
Is brought to vyneters and to the potecarye
Diverse drugges and many a letuarye
Sundry bales and shortly all vitayll
Of the carriage horse have the trauayll

To the garner neither to the berne
With out horse be carried hit is seen
And unto purpose / I seye as I mean
There is no be rekene as I began
So necessary / as horse is unto man
Auguste is a season merry and glad
When every tree with new fruit is lade
With draught of horse the sheuis ben home lad
That month passid / the leeuis gyn to fade
Which made in somer a pleasant lusty shade
What don horse than to speak in words pleyn
The second croppe they carye home of ryweyn
By draught of horse fro ryuers and well is
Bouges be brought to brewars for good ale
Led stoon tymbre caryage of bellis
We bring to chirches in troth this is no tak
We led cloth sackis and many a large male
And gladly summers be sent to forne
With gardeuyandes / how might horse be for born
Ye ^^^dent Iuges the egle and the lion
What I have said does wisely aduertyse
Weyeth this matter in your discrescon
Where ghoos or sheep pleynly to deuyse
Of their nature may in any wise
Justly deem ye / late hit not be spared
Unto an horse be likenyd and compared
That I have told is troth and no feynyng
No wight of reason again hit may apply
Ghoos ne gander ne grene gosselyng
But if they enter the bounds of envy
Late her come forth and say for her party
Ghoos yes trust me well for ye I will not spar^
Like as I feel my verdyte to declare
Where as thou have unto thy pasture
But oon place / to make in thy repair
Hit is granted to me by nature
To abide on water / land and eyer
Now among flowers and grenys that be feyr
Now bathe in ryuers swym^e m many a ponde
For storm or shower as dry as on the land
Through all the land of brutes albion
For feathers arowes as I reherce can
Ghoos is the beast to make comparison
Except feathers of pecok and of swan
Be bow and arowes since the war began
Have englishmen remembrid in storye
Of their enemies had many a victory
Horse in the field may mustre with great pride
When they of trompettis here the blody sowu^
But when an arowe has percyd his side
To ground he goth and cast his master dowu^
Entryng the field he pleyeth the lion
What follows after / his carayn stynketh sore
Sauf skyn and shone there leueth no more
Mighty captayns and knights in the field
Make there wards and their ordenance
First men of arms with polax spear and shield
Set in order dew to have the governance
Which at peyters took the king of france
Thank to the ghoos most be youen of right
Which in the field so proudly took her flight
Sloth of my flight for hasty negligence
Of presumpcion / the ghoos was left behind
When the famous and worthy duc of clarence
Rode on bayard with his eyes blind
Flight of my feathers was put out of mind
And for he set that day of me noforce
So lityl or naught what auayled him his horse
Books old remember well in sentence
Whilom when Rome by his foon was take
The capitole kept of with great defense
Noise of a gander / the captayn did wake
Which remembered / they set up for his sake
In their temples wide and old
A large gandre forged al of fyn gold
His waker noise was their sauacon
Be which the captayn ran upon the wall
Thus be a gander recouerd was the town
Called of the world the cite most ryall
Cite of cytees that day most principal
Was ever horse in book that ye can read
Pro re publica / that did such a deed
In the book named of cheualier destyne
The storye tells as in sentement
There were children of the ryall^ line
Born with chains / and when they were of rent
They turned to swannes be enchantement
Took their flight the troth is full clear
And as swannes they swam^e in the river
This storye is fu^^ autentyk and old
In frenshe compiled often red and seyn
Of thilke cheynes was made a cup of gold
Which is yet kept as som^e folks seyn
And by descent hit longs in certain
To the herfordes ye shall so find in deed
Ceriously who so lift the storye to read
And semblably / not long here to forn^
I tell this tale as for my party
There was a man in lombardy born^
To a ghoos y turned by craft of sorcerye
And so abode viI. year me list not to lie
His writ fyl of than stood he up a man
And bode in service with the duke of melan
And for he was a man of high degree
Boorn of good blood and notable in substance
His kynrede yeueth a ghoos for their liueree
Thy said marvel to put in remembrance
Peyse all tynges Justly in balance
And let the horz leave his boost and roos
To make comparison with gander or ghoos
With in rome the gander was deysyed
Set in their temples of great affection
Be senators of the town magnefyed
As chief protector and sauer of her town
Late horse and sheep leye their boost adoun
But if the ram with his brasyn belle
Can for the sheep some better storye tell
.The Ram speaks for the sheep.

The sheep was simple and loathe to make affraye
Like a be disposed to meekness
The sturdy Ram his advocate was that day
To fore the Iugges he began him dress
With an exordye of latin he did express
Vest purpurea vt rectores regum
In duti sunt arietes ouium
Of this notable ryalle hye scripture
The blessid doctor Augustyn as I read
Be a man goostly fair of figure
Of a meke sheep thus he does proceed
Called maria a maid in thought and deed
Brought forth a lamb of most virtue
The lamb of grace whose name was thesu
Augustyn called this lamb in estate
Be many fold record of scripture
The ryall lamb of color purpurate
Which for mankind list pascion tendure
Born of a maid be grace again nature
When he be mean of her humylyte
Took the clothyng of our humanyte
Born by discente to be both priest and king
King by succession fro david down by line
Of purpyll read was his ryall clothing
This agnus dei born of a pure virgin
Which wysshe a way all venyn serpentyne
Ou caluerye when he for man was deed
With his pure blod purpurate and read
This paschal lamb with out spot al white
Be his passion in bosra steyned read
Which came from edom this lamb of delight
That ghaf his body to man in form of bread
On sherthursday to fore that he was deed
Was there ever found in scripture
Of horse or ghoos so solemn a figure
This lamb was criste that lyneally came
By disc^nt conveyed de pee de gree
From the patriark called abraham
Be ysaac and Jacob so down to Iesse
Which be virtue of his humylite
List to be called the blessid Ihesu
For his mekenes the lamb of most virtue
And for to reherce worldly com^oditees
In re publica make no comparison
There is no best / which in all degrees
Neither. tygre. olyphante. ne griffon
All things rekenyd through every region
Does so great prouffit. hots. ghoos ne swan
As does the sheep unto the ease of man
Late be thy boost thou horse and thy Iangeling
Leye down thy trappours forged of plate and mayl
Cast of thy sadel of gold so fresshly shynyng
What may thy brydel or boces now a vayll
This gostly lamb has done a great battle
Be his mekenes he offered up for man
Clad in purpyll veynquysshid has satan
The ghoos may cakle the horse prike and prance
Neither of hem in process may acteyne*
For to be set or put in remembrance
Again the lamb though they disdeyne
For common prouffit he passes both tweyne
Weye and considere between pour and rich
To him in valewe they be nothing liche
Of brutes albion his wulle is chief richesse
In price furmo^ntyng every other thing
Save grayn and corn marchantes all express
Wulle is chief tresour in this land growyng
To rich and pour this be find clothyng
All nations afferme hit up to the full
In all the world is no better wulle
Of the sheep also comes pellet and eke fell
Gadred in this land for great marchandyse
Carried over the sea where men may hit selle
The wulle skynnes causen men to rise
In to great richesse in many sundry wise
The sheep also tornyth to great prouffit
To help of man bears furs black and white
There is also made of the sheeps skin
Pilches and gloves to drive away the cold
Thereof also is made good parchemyne
To write of books and quayers many fold
The ram of cholchos bare a flees of gold
The flees of gedeon with dew delectable
Was of maria a figure full notable
His flessh his natural restauracion
As some men seyn after great sickness
Roasted or sodyn wholesome is moton
Boiled with grewell / phisiciens express
Full nutrityf after great access
The sheep also concludyng douteles
Of his nature loves rest and pees
Of the sheep is cast away nothing
His horn for nockes to haftes goo his bone
To land great prouffit does his tyrtelyng
His talowe serves for plasters mo than oone
For harp strings his roppes serve echeone
Of whose head boiled with wulle and all
There comes a gely and an oynement riall
For the ache of bones and also for brefure
Hit remedieth and death ease blyue
Causes men of stark Joints to recure
Deed senewes restores again to live
Black shepes wulle with oil olyue
These men of arms with charms preued good
At a strait n^de can well staunche blood
Unto the wolf contrayre of nature
As seyne auctours is this humble be
Loves no debate for which each creature
For his party he would live in rest
Wherefore ye Iuges I hold hit for the best
Rem publicam ye should of right prefer
Always considering that pees is better than werre
In this matter briefly to conclude
Pees to prefer as to my deuyce
Be many old prouyd simylitude
Make no delay / give the sheep the price
Of one assent since that ye be wise
Late all werre and stryf be set a side
And upon pees do with the sheep abide
. The horse.

Nay said the horse your request is wrong
All thing considered me were loath to err
The sheep is cause and has be full long
Of new stryues and of mortal werre
The circumstance, me list not to defer
Thy wulle was cause and great occasion
Why that thy proud duke of bourgoyn
Came to fore calais with flemyngis not a few
Which yaf the sackes and sarplers of the town
To gaunt and brugges his fredom for to show
Of thy wulles / he hight hem possession
His boystous vastyle first was beat down
Him self uneath escaped with the ^yf
What / but thy wulles was cause of this stryf
Were richesse is of wulles and such good
Men draw thither that be recheles
As souldyours that braynles be and wood
To get bagage they put hem self in prees
Thus causest thou werre / and say thou love pees
And if there were no werre ne battle
Lytil or naught great horse should a will
. The ghoos.

No said the ghoos nor my feathers white
With out war should do none a vauntage
Ner hokyd arowes profit but a lyte
To mete our enemies magre their visage
And from them to save us fro damage
Flight of feathers despyte of sheep echene
Shall us defenden again our mortal foone
. The horse holdyng with the ghoos.

Soth quoth the horse as in my Iuward fight
With out werre a fore as I you told
We may not save / ne kept our right
Our garisouns ner castellis old
But here this sheep ruckyng in his fold
Set litell store of sword nor arowes stene
When he in pees may pasture on the grene
If hit so stood that no werre were
Lost were the craft of armorers
What shoold avail polax swerd or spear
Or these daggers wrought be cuttelers
Bows. crossebowes. arowes of fleathers
All these instruments for the werre is wrought
Yef werres were stint they should serve of noght
Their occupacion should have none encrees
Knyghthode should not flower in his estate
In every contre yef that there were pees
No man of arms should be fortunate
I preue that pees is ground of all debate
For in five spekes like as is a whele
Turned all the world who considers well
Begin first at pees which causes richesse
And richesse is thoriginal of pride
Pride causes for lack of rightwysnesse
Werre between remes look ou every side
Hertes contrary in pees will not abide
Thus fynably who can considre and see
Werre is chief ground and cause of pouerte
Pouerte be werre brought to disencrees
For lack of tresour when he can no more
Save only this / he cries after pees
And compleyneth on the werres sore
He seyth be war he has his goods lore
Can no recoure be / but grucching and disdayn
Says the world would fayn have pees again
Thus pride and richesse to conclude in clause
Between the xtremytees of pees and pouerte
Of all debates and werre be chief cause
And says wulles bring in great plente
Where they habounde as folk expert may see
That may I say if men will take kept
War is brought in all only by the sheep
. The sheep answers.

Here is a gentyl rayson of an horse
I trow he be fall in to some dotage
Which of madness by wulle set no forse
Falsely affermyng hit does none advantage
Virtuous plente may do no damage
The sheep berith his flees I told when I began
Not for him self but for the prouffit of man
Diverse comoditees that common of a sheep
Cause no wars what men Iangle or muse
As in her gylte / ye Iugges take ye keep
What that I say their Innocence texcuse
Of couetyse men falsely may muse
Her benefetes and wrongly her atwyte
Of such occasions / where she is not to wit
What is the sheep to blame in your sight
When she is shorn and of her flees mad bare
Though folk of malice for her wulles fight
Causeles to strive fools will not spare
Where pees rests there is all welfare
And sith the sheep loui^h pees of Innocence
Give ye for his part diffinytyf sentence
.The lion and egle yeuyng Judgment.

The ryall egle and the lion of one assente
All thing considered rehercyd here beforn
Of all these three be good aduisement
Of horse and ghoos / and the ram with his horn
Saw in re publica might non be forborne
Be short sentence to voyden all discord
Cast a mien to set hem at acorde
This was the mean to avoid first her stryues
And old grucchyng with their hertes glade
Use these ghyftes and these prerogatives
To that end / to which they were made
Ware with presumpcion their backs be not lade
Vndeuoyded in heart will and thought
To den her office as nature has hem wrought
The horse be kind to lyuen in trauayll
The ghoos with her geslinges to swym^e t^ ye lake
The sheep / whose wulles does so much auayll
In his pasture to grese and him merry make
Their comparisons by on assent forsake
Always remembryng how god and nature
To a good end made every creature
That none to other should do wrong
The rauenons wolf the sely lamb toppresse
And though one be more than another strong
To the febeler do no froward duresse
All extorcion is grounded on falsenesse
Will is now law whether it be wrong or right
Truth is leyd a down / the feeble is put to flight
Odyous of old ben all comparisons
And of comparisons engendrid is hatered
And all folk be not like of conditions
Nor like disposed of thought will and deed
For which cause this fable that ye read
Co^triued was / that who has the grettest part
Of virtuous yeftes should with his friend depart
As thus all virtues allone has not one man
That one lacks nature has give to another
That thou can* not / percas another can
Entercomen therefore as brother does with brother
If charity govern well the rother
All in one vessel to speak in words pleyn
That noman should of other have disdayn
.Thus ends the horse the ghoos and the sheep.

Hit is full hard to know any estate
Double visage looks out of every ho^d
Sewerte is lost Trust is past the date
Thrifte has take his leave over the flood
Law can do no thing with outen good
Theft has leave to goo out at large
Of the co^munes misreule has take the charge
And thou desire thy self to auaunce
Pour or rich whether that thou be
Be lowly and gentyl in thy governance
Good reule douteles may best prefer the
If thou be gentif hurt not thy degree
And thou be pour Do all that thou can
To use good manners for manner makes man
At thy mele be glad in contenance
In mete and drink (...) mesurable
Beware of surfete and misgouernance
They cause men often to be unreasonable
Suffer nothing be said at thy table
That any man may hurt or displese
For good mete and drink axeth Joy and ese
If thy goods to the not suffyse
Conform the ever to that thou have
Govern so thy self in such a wise
In thyn expenses make no waste
Great excess causes unthrift in haste
Beware betyme bear this in thyn heart
Misrewle makes often many men to smerte
Beware of nouellis that be new brought
Though they be pleasant / lokke fast thy lyppe
An hasty word may be to sore bought
Close thy mouth lest thy tongue trippe
To thy self / look thou make not a whyppe
Hurt not thy self / lest thou sore rewe
For thyn owen ese / kept thy tongue in mewe
The world so wide the air so remuable
The sely man so lityl of stature
The grave and gound of clotyng so mutable
The fire so hoot and subtle of nature
The water never in oon / what creature
That made is of these four thus flyttyng
May endure stable and yseuere in abidyng
The further I goo / the more behind
The more behind / the ner my weyes end
The more I seche / the werse can I synde
The lyghter leave / the lother for to wend
The truer I serve / the ferther out of mind
Though I goo loose I am teyde with a syne
Is hit fortune or Infortune thus I fine
