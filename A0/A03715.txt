Here begins the Egloges of Alexander Barclay pressed where of the first three
conteyneth the myseryes of courters and courts of all princes in general /
The matter whereof was translated into English by the said Alexander in form
of Dialoges / out of a book named in latin Misery curialiu^ / compyled by
Eneas Siluius Poet and orator / which after was Pope of Rome / and named
Pius. Cornix. Coridon.







THe famous Poetis with the Musys nine
With wit inspyreth / fre^^e pregnant and dyuyne
Say boldly indyte / in style substanciall
Some in poemis / hye and heroycall
Some them delyteth / in heavy dragedyes
And some in wanton / or merry comedyes
Some in ^atyers / again vices dar carpe
Some in sooete songs / acordant with the harp
And each of these all / had lawde and exc. Hence
After their reason / and style of eloquence
Who in fair speech / cowde breuely comprehend
Most fruytful matter / men did him most commend
And who were fruytles / and in speech superflue
Men by their writing sha^tly set a qwe
Therefore wise poets / to sharp and prove their wit
In homely gestes / wrote many a merry fyt
Before they durst / be of audacyte
Tauenture thyngys / of weight and grauite
In this said manner / the famous Teocryte
First in Siracuse / attemptyd for to write
Certain eglogys / or speches pastoral
Inducynge shepherdes / men homely and rural
Which in plain langage / acordynge to their name
Had sundry talking / sometime of mirth and game
Sometime of things / more like to grauyte
And not exceeding / their small capacyte
Most noble Uirgil / after him long while
Wrote also eglogys / after like manner style
His wits proving / in matters pastoral
Or he durst venture / to style heroycall
And in like manner / now lately in our days
Has other poetis / attemptyd the same ways
As the most famous / baptyst mantuan
The best of that sort / syns poets first began
And Francysk Petrarke / also in Italy
In like manner style / wrote plain and merely
What shall I speak of the fader ancient
Which in brefe langage / both plain and eloquent
Between Alathea / Sewstis stowt and bold
Has made rehersall / of all thy stories old
By true hystoryes / us techynge to object
Against vain fables / of old gentyles sect
Beside all these / yet find I many mo
Which has employed / their dylygence also
Between shepherdes / as it were but a fable
To write of matters / both true and profitable
But all their names / I purpose not to write
Which in this manner / made books infynyte
Now to my purpos / their works worthy fame
Did my young age / my heart greatly inflame
Dulslowth elchwynge / myself to excercyse
In such small matters / or I durst enterprise
To hyer matter / like as these children do
Which first use to crepe / and afterward to go
The bird vnusyd / first fleing from her nest
Dare not adventure / and is not bold nor pressed
With wrynges abroad / to fle as does the old
For use and custom / cawseth all thing be bold
And little conning / by craft and excercyse
To parfyte science / cawseth a man to rise
But or the paynter / can suit his craft attain
Much forward / fassyon / transformyth he in vain
But rasynge superflue / and adding / that does want
Rude pycture is made / both parfyte and pleasant
So where I in youth / a certain warke began
And not concluded / as often does many a man
Yet thought I after / to make the same parfyte
But long I myssyd / yt which I first did write
But here a wonder / I forty year save twain
Procedyd in age / fond my first youth again
To find youth in age / is a problem dyffuse
But now here the troth / and than no longer muse
As I late tournyd / old books to and fro
One little tretyse / I found among the mo
Bycawse that in youth / I did compyle the same
Eglogges of youth / I called it by name
And seeing some men / have in the same delight
At their great instance / I made the same parfyte
Adding and batynge / where I perceived need
All them desiring / which shall this tretyse read
Not to be greuyd / with any plain sentence
Rudely conveyed for lake of eloquence
It were not sitting / a heard or man rural
To speak in ternies / gay and retorycall
So teaches Orace / in art of poetry
That writers namely / their reason should aply
Mete speech aproprynge / to every parsonage
After his estate / behauour wit and age
But if that any would / now to me abject
That this my labor / shall be of small effect
And to the redar / not greatly profitable
And by that manner / as vain and reprouable
Bycawse it makyth / only relacyon
Of shepherdes manner / and dysputacyon
If any such read / my tretyse to the end
He shall well perceive / if he thereto entende
That it contaynyth / both lawdes of virtue
And man enformeth mysleuynge to eschew
With diverse bourdes and sentenches moral
Closyd in shadow / of spechys pastoral
As many poetys as I have said beforne
Have used long time / before that I was borne
But if their writing / though I insure the rate
No name I chalange / of poet lawreate
That name unto them / is mete and does agree
Which writes matters with curyosyte
Mine habyte black / acordeth not with grene
Black betokened death / as it is daily seen
The grene is pleasour / fresshe lust and ^olyte
These two in nature / has great dyuersyte
Than who would ascrybe / except he were a foul
The pleasant lawrer / unto the mourning cowle
Another reward / abides my labor
The glorious sight / of god my savior
Which is chief shepherde / and head of other all
To him for socour / in this my warke I call
And not on Clio / nor old Melpomene
My hope is fixed / of him aided to be
And that his mother / the heuynly empres
Shall to good ending my wit and pene addres
For to accomplysshe / my purpose and intent
To lawde and pleasour / of god omnipotent
And to the profit / the pleasour and the mede
Of all them which shall / this tretyse here and read
But to the redar / now to return again
First of this thing / I will thou be certain
That x. egloggys / this hole treatise does hold
To imitacion of other poets old
In which egloggys / shepherdes thou may se
In homely langage / not passing their degree
Sometime dysputynge / of courtly mysery
Sometime of venus / dysceytfull tyranny
Sometime co^mendynge / love / honest and laudable
Sometime drspysynge / love falls dyscyeuable
Sometime dyspysynge / and blaming auaryce
Sometime excytynge / virtue to exersyse
Sometime of war / a^horrynge the outrage
And of the same time / the manyfolde damage
And other matters / as after shall apere
To their great pleasure which shall them read or here.
The prologe of the first egloge*
^^ o simple shepherdys / met on a certain day
The one well agyd / with lockers hoar and gray
Which after labors / and worldly besynes
Concludyd to ^yue / in rest and quietness
Yet naught had he kept / to find him clothe nor fode
At diverse holys / his hear grew through his hode
A styffe patched felt / hanging over his iyen
His costly clotynge / was thredbare kendall grene
His patchyd Cockers / skant retchyd to his kne
In the side of his felt / there stacke a spone of tree
A botell / his cote / on the one side had torn
For hanging / the ere was nere in sonder worn
In his one hand always / his pype he bare
Whereof the sound / relesyd of his care
His walet with bread and chese / so than he stods
A hoke in his hand / in mids of all his good
Save that he bostyd / to have experience
Of worldly things / by practyse and science
Himself he called / Cornix by his name
The other shepherde / was like unto the same
Save only that he / had lived all his days
In keeping his folk / and seen no farther ways
Yet was he to sight / a stout and lusty freake
And as he bosted / he borne was in the peake
Coridon by name / his neighbors did him call
Himself counted / the stoutest of them all
This Coridon swore / and said to Cornix sure
That he no longar / would there that life endure
In wretchyd labor / and still in pouerte
But to the Cite / he said that go would he
Or else to the court / and there with some abide
Till time that fortune / would better life provide
By which mocyon / Cornix she with plainly
Of court and courts / the care and mysery.
The first Eglogge of the myseryes and manners of the court and courts The
shepher dys Interloquutours / or co^menners in ye same Eglogge be Coridon and
Cornix*
Coridon first speaks. HOrsouth friend Cornix / naught can my heart make light
When I remember / the storms of yester night
The thunder / and lightening / ye tempest and the hayle
Has plainly wasted / our profit and avail
The ferfull thunder / with grenous clap and sound
Our corn has betyn / down flat unto y^ ground
With tempest after / and violence of rain
That it as I doubt / shall never rise again
The hayle has betyn / our sheep within the fold
That all be febled / as well the young as old
Our milk is tournyd / and waxed pale and sour
The storm and tempest / upon our cowches power
Our flock and feldes / is all our hole rich
Which still is subject / to such unhappiness
For after that we / have done both cost and pain
One soden tempest / destroys all again
Than farwele welfare / wors chance we need not fere
Save only to sowke / our claws with the bear
The Cytezins have great tresour sykerly
In cofers closed / avoid of Jeopardy
Their coins cowched fast under lock and key
From place to place / they may the same convey
When they of the theuys / perceive the din and sound
But still must our corn remain upon the ground
Abiding stormys / hayle / thunder and tempest
Till that it be for sykyll ripe and pressed
As for their riches no thunder / frost nor hayle
No storm nor tempest / can hurt or dysauayle
Such careful chanches / and such aduersyte
Us always keeps in wretched pouerte

Cornix answers. O Coridon my mate / I swear so have I blys
Thou plainly spekest / like as the matter is
But as for my part / my mind and wit is blind
To know who gydeth all wether / storm and wind
But this thing I know / but yet not perfytely
Yet bold dare I be to speak to the plainly
For if that I spoke it / in some audience
Some men would malygne / and take it for offense
If god (as men say) does heuyn and earth sustain
Than why does not he / regard our daily pain
Our grievous labor / he justly might deuyd
And for us wretches / some better life prouyd
Some naught does labor / and lives pleasantly
Though all his reason to vices he apply
But se with what sweat / what besynes and pain
Our simple living / we labor to obtain
Behold what yllys the shepherdes must endure
For flock and how should / bare living to procure
In fervent heat / we must intend our fold
And in the winter almost we frese for cold
Upon the hard ground / or on the flyntys brown
We sleep / when other lay on a bed of down
A thousand yllys of danger and sykenesse
With diverse sores / our beasts does oppress
A thousand peryls / and mo if they were told
Daily and nyghtly inuadeth our pore fold
Sometime the wolf / our bestys does devour
And sometime the thief awayteth for his hour
Or else ye soudyour / much wrose tha^ wolf or thief
Against all our flock / incagyth with myschefe
Se how my hands / are with many a gall
And styfe as a board by warke contynuall
My face all scorfy / my color pale and wan
My head all parched / and black as any pan
My berde like brystyls / so that a plyant leke
With a little might may thrust me through ye cheke
And as a stokfysshe wrynkeled is my skyn
Such is the profyt / which I by labor wyn
But this my labor should grieve me much y^ less
If rest or pleasure come of my business
But one sodayn storm of thunder hayle or rain
Again all wastyth / wherefore I took this pain
This is the reward / the deed / and warke deuyne
Unto whose awters pore shepherdes inclyne
To offer tapers / and candels we are feign
And for our offrynge / lo / this have we again
I can not declare / what pity / and mercy
Wrappeth us wretches / in this hard mysery
But this wot I well / it is both right and mede
There most to socoure / where does apere most need

Coridon. Ho there friend Cornix / thou wadest now to far
Thy self forgetting / thou lepest over the bar
Small is my knowledge / thou many a thing have seen
Yet out of the way / forsothe I se the cleue
The king of heuyn / is merciful and just
And them all helps which put in him their trust
When we deserve / he stryketh not always
This in the pulpete / hard I sir Peter say
Yet often he stryketh / when man is obstynate
And by no means / will his myslyuynge hate
So all these plages / and inconuenyence
Falls on us wretches / only for our offense

Cornix. For what offenses / thou art made so to say
Where we of yt sort / which did our lord betray
Or that consentyd / our lord to crucyfy
We never were such / thyselfe can testyfy.

Coridon. Now trust me surely / though you be never so wrouth
I naught shall abasshe to the to say the troth
Thought we shepherdes be out of company
Without occasyon / we live onhappely
Seek well among us and plainly thou shall se
Thief / brawling / malice dyscorde / iniquite
Wrath / lechery / lesynge / envy / and couetyse
And breuely to speak truly we want no vice

Cornix. What nay man parde / all we do not offense
Yet all have sorrow / without all diffrence
Say naught man but troth / do god nothing deserve
Without diffrence / yet be all like to sterue

Coridon. What cease man for shame / thou art of reason scant
The wise / now must learn / wit of the ignorant
I have no knowledge / save only of my tar
Yet this I perceive / man should not seek to far
In gods works / he all does for the best
If thou fyndest here no esement wealth ne rest
What than / seek ferther for plainly so shall I
In some place fortune beholds merely
I bide nolenger by saint Thomas of kent
In such bare places / wherefore every day is lent
The freers have story in some day of the weke
But every day our mete is for to seek
I naught have to bye / beg can I not for shame
Except that I were blind / impotent or lame
If such a gadlynge / as I should beg or crave
Of me such mercy / and pity would men have
That they for alms (I swear by goddys sockys)
In every town would make me scour the stocks
That can one Drome / by many assayes tell
Whit that ill science / I purpose not to mell
Here no thing I have wherefore I need to care
Now Cornix a diewe straight forward will I fare

Cornix. Straight forward man / hey Benedicite
All other people have as great care as we
Only bare need / is all our pain and woe
But these town dwellers hauy many pains mo
Our pain is plaesure nere / incomparyson
Of their great ylles and sore vexacyon
Of all such things have I experyence
Than may thou surely give to me credence
Whether wylt thou go / to live more quietly
Man / all the world is full of mysery.

Coridon. What man / the court is fresshe and full of eas
I can draw a bow / I shall some lord there pleas
Thy self can report / how I can byrdys kill
Mine arowe touches of them nothing but the byl
I hurt no flesh / nor brule no part at all
Were not my shotynge our living were but small
Lo here a sparowe / lo here be thrusshes four
All these I killed / this day within an hour
I can dance the raye / I can both pype and sing
If I were merry / I can both hurl and slynge
I rone / I wrastell / and can well throw the bare
No shepherde throws the axeltre so far
If I were merry / I could well lepe and spring
I were a man mete / to serve a prince or king
Wherefore to the court / now will I get me plain
A dew sweet Cornix / fare well yet onys again
Provide for thy self so shall I do for me.

Cornix. Do way Coridon / for goddys love let be
Naught else is the court / but even the deuyls mowth
And place most careful of east / west / north and sowth
For thy long service / there need shall be thy hyre
Out of the water thou lepest in to the fire
We live insorowe / I will it not deny
But in the court is the well of mysery.

Coridon. What man thou see / and in like wise se I
That lusty courters / go always Jolely
They have no labor / yet at they well besene
Bardydand guarded in pleasant white and grene
They do naught else / but revel sleep and drink
But on his foldys / the pore shepherde must think
They rest / we labor / they gayly decked be
While we go ragged by need and pouerte
Their color lusty / they bide no storm nor shours
They have y^ pleasours / but al they pain is ours
They have all things / but we wretches have naught
They singe they dau^ce while we lore sight for thought
But what brings the^ to this prosperyte
Strength / cowrage / frendys / craft and audacyte
If I had frendys / I have all thing belyde
Which might in court / a rowme for me provide
But sith courters have this life contynually
They have all pleasour / and naught of mysery.

Cornix. Not so Coridon / often under yalowe locks
Be hyd foul scabbes / and ferefull french pockes
Their reuyld shyrtes / of clothe / white / soft / and thyn
Often times cloketh / a foul and scurfy skyn
And where we labor / in warkes profitable
They labor sorer in warke abhomynable
They may have shame to Jet so up and down
When they be dettours / for doublet house and gown
And in the tavern / remain they last for lag
When never a cross / is in their courtly bag
They crake / they boste / and vaunt as they were wood
And most when they sit / in myddis of others good
Naught have they wretches save care and mysery
Who has it proved all courtynge shall defy.

Coridon. Mary sir by this / I se experyence
That thou in the court / has kept some resydence

Cornix. Remembrynge of court they pain contynuall
I think these pains / but easy / short and small
So the remembrance / of grievous care and pain
Causes me gladly this hardenes to sustain
Who that has lived in court I the assure
Instead of pleasour may this our life endure
Our need is eased with pleasant liberte
There care is he pyd with hard captivity
I thought our living care and vexacion
Before (of the court) or thou made mencyon

Coridon. If the court be such as thou do plainly tell
I think it folly with it to deal or mell
Better is frewyll / with need and pouerte
Than need in the court / with hard captyuyte
But tell me Cornix / I pray the instantly
How know thou first this gere so perfytly

Cornix. While I in youth in Croidon town did dwell
Often to the court I coolys brought to sell
And than I learned and noted parfytly
Of court and courters the care and mysery
For I lurked and none regarded me
Till I had knowledge / of hye and low degree
What was their manner / behauour and usage
The more I trayed / more saw I of outrage

Coridon. Than farewell courtynge / I se thou countest best
Here to remain / in simple wealth and rest
But in mean season / I pray the heartily
Declare me all hole / the courtly mysery
Behold our wethers ley chewynge of the cud
Here is no peril / of water dyke nor mud
Slowth loves slombrynge much sleep is reprouable
But merry talking is greatly confortable
Here is cold shadow / here is a clear fontayne
When words greueth / drink and begyne again
For long time passed / I have herd of thy lore
Which thing me moves / to here y^ talk the more
Begin and show me / the courts wretchydnes
So I parchaunce / shall set thereby the les
And where long talking / often greueth many a man
I shall the furnysshe / with words now and than
What say on Cornix why art thou now so still
Thy wit and reason was out to be at will

Cornix answered. Feign would I common / for pleasure and pastyine
But troth is committed / most grievous faut or crime
And some might me here / which by their words sour
Might bring me in court / in grievous dysplesour
Because I shall prove all the^ which court does hau^t
Miserable folys / mad men and ignorant
Therefore Coridon / among the bowys prye
If there lurk any Jay / sterlynge / thrusshe / or pie
To note my words / and that them forth again
Whereby I might wyn dyspesour loss or pain

Coridon. Loss / goddys domynus to lose (thou have no good
Save hoke and cokers / thy botell and thy hood
Thy hode all ragged / can keep no body dry
Many have as good / though none can them espy
He has small reason / that has a hode more fine
And would for malice / berob the here of thine
As for dyspleasour / I warant the also
Thou shall for princes / great eas and pleasour do
For many upon them / do daily crave and call
To be in service / which are not mete at all
To be in the court / they labor so gladly
Because they know not / thereof the mysery
Whom to receive / it is not profitable
And to despise them / it is not honorable
If thou such constrayne to leave / of their own mind
Thou do to pryncys / a very pleasour kind
And other foles / shall take thy tale in sport
And never the less / shall to the cour resort
Than let not Cornix / plainly to say the troth
Let scabbyd clawe / and gyly men be wroth
Better is for truoth / suffer paynys hard
Than for false flattrynge / to have a great reward

Cornix. Thou say but reason / I lawde the by saint Joha^
Than boldly demand / I pray the Coridon
Of such matters / as to the court belong
And I shall answer / dene if it be wrong
That I have lernyd / by practyse and scyens
I shall as I may / give the intellygence.

Coridon. The court as thou say / is false and dysceyuable
Than tell me wherefore / that men most honorable
There in remaining / abydyth care and pain
And yet by their will / they will not forth again

Cornix. Many things be / which monyth people blind
To ren to the court / with fervent heart and mind
But of all things / this specially is one
The hope of honor / called ambycyon
Right so Mynalcas did / lust of honor call
And as he comyttyd / Ambycyon is egall
Unto that virtue / which men call charity
Charity suffceth / all hard aduersyte
All pain and labor / and all vexacyon
And even as much / suffceth Ambycyon
For worldly wretches / in honor to excel
Force not to labor / down to the pyt of hell
Lo here chief cause / why men to court resort
But onys in the court / when they have had comfort
Such is of mankind / the blind calamyte
That in one state / if they long time have be
A life there living / but vile and full of shame
Yet by no manner / can they despise the same
So who that in youth / has used courts rage
They find no manner / to leave the same in age
And to win lawdes / and praise of the comonte
In no hard labor / think they dyffyculte
But if men huntyd for folys and hye glory
As they hunt daily for honor transitory
Right few or none / would to the court apply
Thereto be tangled / with care and mysery
But unto the court / if thou have thine intent
Because Prelatys / and wise men it frequent
Here what the shepherde / of Nazareth does say
As I hard faustus / declare upon a day
Upon they hye chair / and seat of moses
Sat the old scrybes / and sect of pharyses
Live as they teache / but live not as they do
And thus in the court / man must behave him so
His life refoucmynge / like as such ought to live
Not by example / which they to other gyfe.

Coridon. These be hye matters / and far beyond my wit
If such be the court / what man would mel with it
Yet I assuer the / before this I have seen
That worthy shepherdys long in y^ court have been

Cornix. All that I grant the / but ask and thou shall find
That such in the court / aboyde again their mind
As the rich shepherde / which wonid in mortlake

Coridon. O Cornix cornix / feel how my heart does quake
On him what I think my heart is full of pain
Would god that we could get him to live again
What time he lived / some blamed him ywys
Which syns he did / does him sore lack and mys
He passyd Codrus / he passyd Mynalcas
He passyd Mopsus / and also Lysydas
None other shepherde might with that man compare
In during his life / we nedyd not to care
But ever sith time that he was dead and gone
We suffer wrongs defender have we none
He was the patron of things pastoral
His face and favor / forget I never shall
While I was younger he came by our cotage
Than was my father / Amyntans / far in age
But the same shepherde / gave him both clothe and gold
O Cornix the young be much unlike the old.

Cornix. Yes / syns his days / a cock was in the fen
I know his voice among a thousand men
He taught / he preched / he mendyd every wrong
But Coridon / alas / no good thing bydeth long
He all was a cock / he wakened us from sleep
And while we slumberyd he did our foldys keep
No cur / no fores / nor butchers dogs wood
Could hurt our foldys / his wachynge was so good
The hungry wolves which that time did abound
What time he crowed / abashed at the sound
This cock was no more / abashed of the fox
Than is a lion / abashed of an ox
When he went / faded the flower of all the fen
I boldly dare swear / this cock trod neruer hen
This was a fader / of things pastoral
And that well shows his church Cathedral
There was I lately / about the mydes of may
Coridon / his church / is twenty sithe more gay
Than all the churches / between the same and kent
There saw I his towmbe / and chapel excellent
I thought five hours / but even a little while
Saint Johu^ yt virgin me thought did on me smyle
Our parysshe church / is but a dongyon
To that gay church / to make comparyson
If the people were as pleasant as the place
Then were it paradyse / of pleasour and solace
Than might I truly / right well find in my heart
There still to abide / and never to depart
But ^ins that this cock / by death has left his song
Trust me Coridon / there many a thing is wrong
When I saw his figure / lay in the chapel side
Like death for weeping / I might no longer bide
Lo all good things / to sone away does glyde
That no man lyketh / to long does rest and abide
When the good is gone / my mate this is the case
Seldom the better reentreth in the place.

Coridon. Thou say trowth Cornix / I make to god a vow
But ay mate Cornix / se where be we now
Far from the matter / where as we first began
Begin where we left / I pray the if thou can

Cornix. That shall I lightly / thou saydest that a sort
Of good old shepherdes did to the court resort
But such as be good / be there again their will
For truly in court / they find less good than ill
To se much amys / to them it is great pain
Wha^ for their words / none will his vice refrain
Then get they but scorn / and indygnacyon
And for their good minds / pain and vexacyon:

Coridon. I pray the Cornix / proceed / tell by and by


Cornix Of court and courts ye pain and mysery.
That were a long matter and very hard to do

Coridon. This is best remedy / take longer time thereto
Here is gay shadow / here is a pleasant cool
Take bank and flowers / for cusshen and for stole

Cornix. Than lay down thy hoke / give me that botell nere
With often washing the throat and voice is clear

Coridon. Lo here the botell / drink such as is therein
Drink better / and than in the name of god / begin

Cornix. A sir / well drawn / and that with little pain
Than turn we our speech / now to ye court again
Woe will to the court / first let him think before
Whether he may suffer labor and pains sore
Both hunger and thryst / injury and wrong
For these shall he / find the rude courters among
And more after these / yet let him think again
Whether in the court / he may that thing obtain
Which he desires / me thinks the contrary
Men would find honor / there find they mysery
Thus all be folys / which wyllyngly there dwell
Coridon / the court is the baytynge place of hell

Coridon. That is hardly said man / by the rode of rest


Cornix. I grant it is hard / but to say troth is best
But yet shall I prove / my saying verytable
A duert my words / se if I be culpable
Unto our purpose / by diverse ways three
Men may be folys / I shall them count to the
They all be folys which set their thought and mind
That thing for to seek which they shall never find
And they be foles / which seek thing with delight
Which if they find / is harm and no profit
And he is a fool / a sot and a geke also
Which choseth a place / unto the same to go
And where diverse wayes*lead thither dyrectly
He chosed the worst / and most of Jeopardy
As if dyners ways / lay unto Islyngton
To stowe on the would / quaueneth or trompyngto^
To dover dyrham / to barwyke or ex^ster
To grantham / totnes brystowe or god manchester
To roan paris / to lyonor florance

Coridon. What hoo man / abide / what all ready in france
Lo a fair journey / and shortly endyd to
With all these towns / what thing have we to do

Cornix. By god / man know thou that I have had to do
In all these towns / and yet in many mo
To se the world / in youth me thought was best
And after in age / to give myself to rest

Coridon. Thou might have brought one / and set by our village


Cornix. What man / I I might not for lack of caryage
To carry my owneselfe / was all that ever I might
And sometime foreas / my sachell made I light

Coridon. To our first matter / we better must intend
Else in a twelve month / we skant shall make an end

Cornix. True said Coridon / that can I not denay
But thyn own self / did lead me from the way
Unto these towns / now to return again
To any of them all / if there lay ways twain
The one sure and short / and ledynge dyrectly
The other wey longer and full of Jeopardy
That fool were worthy a babyll and a hode
Which would chose yt worst perceyuyng well ye good
One of these folyes / or all oppress that sort
Which not constrained / does to the court resort
Other that they search / which they may not attain
Or yt / which gottynge / shall do them hurt and pain
Or of two ways / they use to leave the best
For on no godnes / does their desires rest

Coridon. What is the desire / and purpos pryncypall
Chefely frequented / among these courters all
And for what reward / take they such besynes

Cornix. Mine humble speech / and langage pastoral
If it were able / should write his acts all
But while I ought speak / of courtly mysery
Him with all such / except I utterly
But what other pryncys commonly frequent
As true as I can to show is mine intent
But if I should say / that all the mysery
Which I shall after rehers and specyfy
Were in the court / of our most noble king
I should fail troth / and plainly make leasing
And if that I said that in it were no vice
So should I lie / in right like manner wise
As for my part / I blame no man at all
Same such / as to vice / be subget bound and thrall
For among all men / this wise stands the case
That more ill tha^ good does grow in every place

Coridon. Right well excusyth / I thought not erst sythene
That simple Cornix had half this subtylte
But now apereth / the very troth certain
That men of wourshyp / have not best wit and brain
Now tell how courters / which gapeth for honor
Instead of honor / find pains sharp and sour

Cornix. All they which suffer in court labor and pain
There by supposyge / true honor to obtain
At much abusyth / my words nor doctrine
Be much unable / to give them medycyne
For Elebor the old / withal his salues pure
Their wylfull folly / could scantly help and cure
What man would think / that trow honor profunde
In pryncys halles / or courts may be found
There / none has honor / by virtue and conning
By manners / wysdom / sadness / nor good living
But who has power / hye rowmes or riches
He has most honor and lawde / of more and less
For what poor man a plain and simple soul
Though he were holy / as every was saint Powle
Have thou ever seen exalted of a king
For all his manners and virtuous living
These be the words of shepherde Siluius
Which after was pope / and called was Pius

Coridon. What yes man parde / right many have men seen
Which in pore houses borne and brought up has been
That from low rowmes and careful pouerte
Be now exalted to greatest dygnyte

Cornix. Such is the pleasour of pryncys / to promote
Such unto honor / which scant be worth a grote
But whom promote they / give credence unto me
Such as in manners / to them most lykest be
And in what manners / in beestely lechery
In couetyse / Ire / or in vile glotony
In hasty murder / and other cruelte
Believe my Coridon I say but veryte
A covetous prince / has him most acceptable
Which gathers / coin / by meanys dysceyuable
As falls accusynge / and wrong extorcyon
Selling of justice / frawde / and oppressyon
A lecherous prince / has him best in conceyt
Which can by crafts his place and time best in weyt
Uirgyns and wives most fair and amyable
To bring to his bed / for lust abhomynable
And a dronken prince has him as derest mate
Which most can surfeit / most revel and drink late
And unto a prince / which loves cruelte
Chefly in favor / and conceyt is he
Which most delytyth / in shedynge ma^nys blood
Few vicyous princes promote such as be good
Now is accepted of men of hye degree
Nor set in honor from humble pouerte
Except he has done / some deed so great of fame
That all the world may wonder at the same
But this same honor is nether true nor stable
Which growyth of rote / so ill and detestable
For very honor and true or parfyt glory
Comyth of acts / of lawdable memory
In suportacyon / of right and equity
Or in defending / the church and co^monte
Or other acts / common or pryuate
Which sou^de to wourshyp these make a true estate
But such true honor / few princes do deserve
And no more do they / which in the court them serve
Sith all almoost / be of mysgouernaunce
For no good do they / except it be by chance

Coridon. Yet at the least way such men reputed be
Men of great honor / among the co^monte
For while such walk / in court or in street
Each man inclynyth / which them does se or mete
Of gothe the bonet / a beck at every word
Each man must nedys / give place unto my lord
After his degree / birth / or promocyon
Such of the commons / have salutacyon
And shortly to say / men dothem more honor
Than to the figure / of Christ our savior

Corinx. It is as thou say / forsothe my Coridon
But hark what they say / at last when men be gone
Than they salute them / in the deuyls name
And pray unto god that they may dye with shame
And so does many by tourment and dolor
When fykell fourtune / lyketh on them to lour
But such as does stoop to them before their face
Gives them a mock when they be out of place
And one does whysper / soft in others ere
And says this tyran / is feller than a bear

Coridon. Why and fere they no more for to say thus


Cornix. No / but hark man what says ye good pope Siluius
Lo this same is he / which by his bad council
Causes our prince to be to us to fell
This same is he / which rayseth deem and tax
This same is he / which strayned men on rackes
This same is he / which causes all this war
This same is he / which al our wealth does mar
This is of commons / the very dedly mall
Which with these charges / thus does oppres us al
Who him dyspleaseth / he beth all to dust
This same is he / which kyllyth whom him lust
That all the deuyls / of hell / him hence carry
That we no longer / endure his tyranny
This is the honor / and all the reverence
Geuyn unto them / wha^ they be from presence
But in such honor / who ever has delight
Which is frawdefull / so faint and vnparsyte
I am not a ferde to call him made and blind
And a very fool or else a sot of kind

Coridon. Cornir my friend / thou spekest now to plain
I fere lest this gere shall turn us unto pain
If any man be nere / be still a while and hark

Cornix. I fere not at all / now I am set on warke
Beside this Coridon / in court most part does dwell
Flaterers and liars / Coryers of fafell
Juggelers and dezers / and such a schamfull table
Which for a dynner lawd men no thing laudable
But men cyrcumspect / whice be dyscrete and wise
Does such vain lawdes / vterly despise
For truly no lawde / is named good nor true
Except it proceed of men which love virtue
A rybawdus blame / is commendacyon
Such use to slander / good conuersacyon
But such they commend / as be to them semblable
So their dyspraysynge to the is profitable

Coridon. Now truly my heart is easyd with the same
For godfray gormand lately did me blame
And as for himself / though he be gay and stowt
He has naught / but folly within and eke without
To blow in a bowl / and for to pyll a platter
To gyrne / to brawle / to counterfayt / to flatter
He has no felawe / between this and croydown
Save the proud plowma^ / gnato of chorlyngtown
By cause he always malygnyth again me
It plain apereth / our life does not agree
For if we lyuyd / both after one rate
Than should I have him to me afrendly mate
But Cornix / proceed / tell forth of dyguyte

Cornix. Often in my tale / I hyndryd am by the
Such as for honor unto the court resort
Look seldom times / upon the lower sort
To the hyer sort / for most part they intend
For still their desire is hyer to ascend
And when none can make with them comparyson
A gain thyr princes co^spyre they by treason
Than when their purpos can not come well to frame
Again they dyscende / and that with utter shame
Coridon thou know right well what I mean
We lately of this experience have seen
When men would ascend to rowmys honorable
Ever is their mind and lust insaciable
What ever they have / they cownt the same but small
While ought is greatter / naught ca^ the^ pleas but al
And onys in Cambrydge I hard a scoler say
One of the same / which go in copis gay
That no man should fyx / end of felicite
In wordly honor / hye rowme or dignite
For it is a thing / in certain and unstable
Which man of him self / to puruay is not able
In another power this honor always is
Who most it sekyth / of it does often mys
And who that seruyth / for honor and hye name
And in this world to get him noble fame
Much pain abydyth through cares and dystres
And with many men he has much besynes
And often must he rather / the mind of men content
Than do the pleasour of god omnipotent
Than sith two honors of diverse sortys be
One which is gyuyn of men of honest
The second honor is of a multitude
For very troth that man of wit is rude
Which huntyth in court for the first honor
The same to purchase / by care and great labor
As fortune honor / no man can there obtain
Where neither manners nor virtues does rain
The second honor is of comonte
Who that requires / yet more folysshe is he
For he demaundyth / a thing right perylous
Unsure unstable / and also vicious
But both these sortys always be vexyd sore
When they in honor / se many them before
And often times / such as most unworthy be
For in court seldom is lawdyd honest
Thus who of honor / and lawd is covetous
Unto him the court is most contraryous
And no where he fyndyth greatter vexacyon
Thau following the court suynge ambycyon
For who would ascend / to honor pryncypall
Fyndyth in the court / most care and pain of all

Coridon. We have enough / had of comunycacyon
As touching honor / and commendacyon
Or worldly praysynge / for rowmys and hye name
And though more / might be declared of the same
What leave some my mate / for other on to brall
It were over much for us to talk of all
Now talk we of might or hye auctoryte
How men for the same / love in the court to be
Speed the / for clowdys apere on every side
If any storm fall / we can not longer abide

Cornix. As towchynge power / might or auctoryte
Some thing in the court in favor great to be
To be with pryncys of power excellent
Some folys countyth a thing preeminent
Or that men should him a kyngys tutour call
Much to comaunde / but naught to do at all
Both peace and battle / to order at his will
To be of power / both to do good and ill
But many a thousa^de / which have such power sought
Has been dysceyued and shortly come to naught
As with one Nero named Elawdus
In so great favor was one Seianus
That while this Nero was far from his empire
Seianus ruled the same at his desire
So much that Seian had honor than in deed
As of all the world countyd the second head
That if this Nero had dyed or his hour
This Seian / truly should have been emperors
But by one letter he after takyn was
In utter dishonor deposyd from his place
Led for a spectacle straight unto Tyber bancke
And there behedyd such was his mede and thank
All his ymagys / in his honor erecte
Where with great malice down to yt ground deiecte
Thus all his power endyd with care and shame
Who that has wysdom / will note and mark y^ same
It is no matter / nor thing of certaynte
With mighty princes of great power to be
No state is febler more wayke and incertayne
Than such as semyth great with his sovereign
He has enurous / malygners / and ill will
All out of favor / adiugeth him for ill
And all the householde does comoly him hate
Which with the master / is servant and nere mate
And this in the world is seen most commonly
That all hye rowmes be subject to envy
Such of all other / be hatyd and suspect
If the ought offend / it lightly is detect
And from all defense if they be clear and quyte
Than lie they in wait / them sharply to bacbyte
Some for them study / frawdys dysceyt and gyle
And taleberers walk and grieve them other while
And like as they ^ye is greuyd with a mote
So princes favor / though it be never so hot
Is lightly greuyd / and that for small offense
Thought it were gottyn / with playnfull dylygence
And often is it lost for none offense at all
So much with princes may tongues falls make fall
So much taleberers / by chraftes forge can
That the emperor / called Adrian
Slew his old frendys / and hatyd many one
By these taleberers and false detraccyon
And many princes or this have done the same
By hasty credence / dystraynynge sore their name
And as in Croydon I hard the colyer preche
That holy scripture does us infourme and teache
How Saul / David / and prudent Solomon
Commaundyd to be slain of such many one
As has been with them in great auctorite
And daily of such / may we example se
Because Isaake in might did rise and stand
Falls Abymaleche him dro^e out of his land
And Alexander with his own handys slew
Citron his friend / which he did after rewe
Because he compared unto this conqueror
His father Philippus / lawdys and honor
And such like chance / but lately did befall
In the land of Apuly / to the great Senescall
Which was so greatly in favor with the queen
That none was so great as he himself did wene
And thought in favor to bide more steadfastly
For he abusyd the queen dyshonestly
But to another / the queen tournyd her love
And than him murdered his presence to remove
And when she had found / the menys him to kill
Than had she diverse lovers at her will

Coridon. O cursyd woman / and deed of cruelte


Cornix. Ye ye Coridon / mo be as bad as she
Some has by malice their sowkynge children slain
But to my matter will I return again
Their frawde and malice I will not now declare
Who with them deals / perceyuyth what is care
But now Coridon / to princes to return
Who pleasyth this day is out again the mourn
Right few / or none / or by a princes side
Which does in favor contynually abide
While one ascendyth another does descend
This is the thing whereto they most intend
And which in the court / men chefely go about
Themself to bring in / and rub another out
And than to clym up to office and renown
And while they ascend to thurst another down
Echone desires his felawe to excel
There is none order / no more than is in hell
No love / no favor / faith / nor fydelyte
One brother can not sure for another be
The sone for the father has no compassyon
And like pity / has the father of his sone
Each man for him self / and the friend for all
Echone desires for to be pryncypall
Echone will command and have preeminence
And if any one have place of excellence
He has about him a thousand iyen and nine
And as many tongues to bring him to ruin
On every side / enuyers him awayte
Deuysynge meanys / to put him from his state
A man of power / which many men may dear
Has ever ill will / thus may he many fear
Hye towers decay byldyd / by flodys side
Which does the wawes contynually abide
What shall a shepherde do in the court to tend
Whose life and service on one man does depend
Though thou in favor be with a princes or king
Yet trust not therein / it is uncertain thing
Thou have him not bound / to the with chaynnys strong
Of lead or iron / to last and tarry long
But with feeble wax / such band can not last
When love wexyth cold / than shall y^ tynkes brast
The fervor of wrath shall the^ consume and melt
Than is thy favor skant worth a shepys pelt

Coridon. Of some have I herd of men of great honor
Which have in the court / bid always in favor
Till time their princes departed from this life
And then with the new had like prerogatyfe
Thus in the court no thing so varyable
As thou rehersest / nor yet so reprouable

Cornix. I grant the Coridon / some such have there been
But that is a bird / which seldom time is seen
That is but fortune / and chance not on to trust
But many be thrown / unwarily to the dust
Some while their princes / still lyuyd in renown
But when they depart / all tournyth vpset down
Than if some have favor / with princes successors
We se them seldom / set in so hye honors
As with their elders / they did before obtain
A man sone fallyth / and slow is up again
So many se we deposyd from degree
And how much the more / they were indygnyte
So much more / after be they vile and abject
Their anucyent / name countyd of none effect
Than they perceive / who was their friend and fo
Before in honor / forsothe they could not so
To men in power / so me often stoup and beck
Which gladly would / se their hedys from the neke
When they by fortune at on the ground again
Than langh their foes and have at them dysdayne
There friends dolor and sorrow is not small
Their own dyswourshyp a shame is worst of all
For after they live still in dolor and dystres
In shame rebukes in care and heuines
This is the common end and sure conclusyon
Of such as with princes serve for promocyon
Wherefore I dare call them foles before the
Which serve in the court / for might or dygnyte

Coridon. For sothe mate Cornix I can not well deny
But that such chances does happyn commonly
Than better is small fire one easily to warm
Than is a great fire to do one hurt or harm
I am assured / as for thy self and me
We need not to fere / to fall from out degree
Beggary is lowest / who that can fare with all
Nedyth not to fere to lower state to fall
But have done Cornix and tell the wretchydnes
Of such as in court / serve only for riches
As for the other the best that we do may
Is to dyffer it / until another day

Cornix. Well said Coridon / I am content with that
But first let me drink I shall the better chat
This whey is sour / but use eases the pain
Drink Coridon and stope it up again

Coridon. Now say on Cornix / thy talking lykyth me
I se that council / excludyth capusyte
Save for thy wysdom or this time as I wene
With courtly mysery I tangled should have been
But well fare council when it is true and good
I would that Mynalcas / this also understood

Cornix. Many of the court resort / daily doutles
In yongthe to gather / some treasour or riches
Than against age they may go out again
And afterward live / without labor or pain
In hope of this eas and latter lyberte
Many in the court bide long captyuyte
And if some courter / thus to him self does say
Alas shall I never ought for myself puruey
When shall I in court / some little bank procure
That from the bag and staff mine age may be sure
The fool thinks / than most riches for to have
Against such season when nerest is his grave
When nere is endyd his journey of this life
Than is he for vitayle most besy and pensyfe
Our savior says / it is as hard doutles
To one which fixes his pleasour on riches
To enter that royalme / which is above the sky
As an ass to enter / through a nedyls iye
I hard our vicayr say in like manner wise
Onys when he preached against couetyse
Than it is folly great riches to purchase
And by it to loss the hope of heavenly place
Is not christ able his poor men to sustain
Yes and to ryd them out of all other pain
The poor apostels / be greater now of fame
Than rich Cresus for all his royal name
When man has in god his trust and confydence
In all time of need he faylyth none expense
All good men fixes their trust in god parde
He knows better / what thing we need then we
Of some poor freers is made more curyously
Than is some abbey / or rich monastery
The first has their trust in god our creator
The other trustyth upon their vain treasour
Thus god often helpyth them that in him have trust
When wordly riches men leuyth in the dust

Coridon. Cornir thy prouys was not for to preche
But me of the courters mysery to teache
Against thyn own self thou spekyst now parde
For first thou grutced against pouerte
Again thou blamyst plenty of riches now
But few men living thy saying will allow
For without riches thou say openly
Virtue nor conning / now be nothing set by

Cornix. I will not deny / but it is need doutles
For all men living for to have some riches
But trust me Coridon / there is dyuersyte
Between to have riches / and riches to have the
Than thou have riches / when thou despysest store
Bestowest it well and forsest not therefore
But riches has the / when wretchyd couetyse
Thy mind subdeweth / to every ill and vice
And when thy desire is yet insaciable
Though thou have treasour / almost innumerable
Such manner riches / the colyer tell the can
Is vile and odyble both unto god and man
But now to the court for to return again
Some think by princes great riches to obtain
But while they coueyt / in ryched for to be
Coridon for sothe / they lose their lyberte
And yet if I should / the very troth expres
No man can in court find just and true riches
If thy lord give the other gold or fe
Unto his service more art thou bound parde
Saint Gregori says affyrmynge the same thing
In greattyst gyftys / is greattyst reckoning
But if thou wylt than forth of the court depart
When by thy prince inryched thus thou art
Than shall be found some gyle some frawd or train
By mean whereof thou lesyst all again
A fawt shall be found / some one shall the accuse
Of thing whereof thou did never think nor muse
Though thou be gyltles yet shall thou be co^uyct
Fare well thy good all shall be from the lyct
Or some back reckoning / conseruynge thine office
Of all thy riches shall pyll the with a tryce
Than art thou clappyd in the flete or clynke
Tha^ naught must thou say wha^ so ever thou think
For if thou begin to murmur or complain
Thy life thou lesest than have thou harms twain

Coridon. Yet were it better for to continue still
As long in the court / as is the princes will

Cornix. If thou continue / thou must be dylygent
And ready at hand / at each commandment
When he commaundyth / thou must be pressed to fight
To ride and to go / by day and eke by night
No dread no daungere / may help the nor excuse
No pain nor peril may thou fle nor refuse
Some time must thou be in air contagyous
And in thousands other of chaunches perylous
What he commaundyth that needs do thou must
Be it good or ill / ryghtwys / or oniust
Laughe when he laughyth / all if thyn heart be sad
Weep when he wepyth / be thou never so glad
Lawde what he lawdeth / though it be not lawdable
Blame what he blames / though it be commendable
And shortly to speak / thou must all thing fullfyll
As is his pleasour / and nothing at thy will
None of thy wits / ar at thy lyberte
Unto thy master / they nedys must agree
What is more folyshe / more found or imprudent
Than to get riches / by such extreme tourment
For naught it is else but plain a frenesy
To bide for riches / this care and mysery
It would make one clawe / where as it does not itche
To se one live pore / by cause he would dye rich
By cause one in court / has gotyn good or twain
Should all men suppose / the same there to obtain
And in hope thereof / to lose their lyberte
But seeking riches / such fyndeth pouerte
For many in court / while they abide riches
Spend all their treasour / and live in wredchydnes
What says some fool / spend on a ^one voayge
Parchaunche my wagys / shall pass mine heritage
But while he spends / till skant remain a grote
Home he retournyth / ye with a threde bare cote
His horse is so fat that plain he is not able
To get his body / nor head out of the stable
His sword and bucler / is pleggyd at the bear
And to go lyghter / so is his other gear
The ryder walkyth / now with his bow and arows
With a fair excuse / in hedgys to kill sparows
And often retournynge / he said but all to late
A diewe all courtynge / in the deuyllys date

Coridon. A sir this passyth / now by the rode of some
Better were for such / for to hade bid at home
But tell me Cornir / has all men the boundage
And pain of the court / for no more advantage

Cornix. Yes sometime riches is gyuyn by some chance
To such as of good have greattyst abundance
Like wise as stremys / unto the sea does glyde
But on bare hyllys / no watter will abide
So if a poor man serve in the court long while
Fortune shall never so friendly on him smyle
But that a rich man in rowme or hye dygnyte
For a little service / has more reward than he
As for the service / none in the court shall pounder
They note the person / still is the pore kept under
For a little man / mete is a small hakney
So smallest persons / has small reward away
But men of wourshyp / set in auctoryte
Must have rewards great after their degree
And Coridon princes / give naught I tell the plain
But when that they lust / revoke again
And so such things / which princes to the give
To the be as sure / as watter in a syue
Thou may not of them / make elienacyon
Nor the same care / until another nacyon
Thou may not dyspose them after thyn intent
But like as thy prince / is pleasyth and content
Than such vain riches can be thine by no skyll
Sith thou haste no might to spend the^ at thy will
Ye and more over thou have no faculte
The same to bequeth / at will when thou must dye
If thou want issue / no man shall be thine heir
Save only the prince thus does the world fair
If thou have issue / succeed shall they not the
Except with thy prince they will in service be
How many has be slain / me nydyth not expres
Of such as them erst / auancyd to riches
So princes ar wont / with riches some to feed
Is we do our swyne / when we of larde have need
We feed our hogs / them after to devour
When they be fattyd by costys and labor
In like wise princes / promotyth many one
And when thy be rich / they gnaw them to the bone
Like as Longinus / and Seneca doutles
Which as says codrus were slain for their riches
So writes Pius / whom some Eneas call
A clawse allegynge / of famous Juuenall

Coridon. The more of the court that thou do count and tell
The less me lykyth / with it to deall or mell

Cornix. What bide Coridon yet have thou not herd all
The court is in earth / any mage infernal
Without fair painted / within owgly and vile
This know they surely which there has be while
But of our purpos now for to speak again
Few princes give that / which to themself attain
Trust me Coridon / I tell the by my soul
They rob saint Peter / therwt to clothe salt powle
And like as daily we both may se and here
Some pyll the church / therewith to lead the queen
While men promotyd by such rapyne ar glad
The wretches pylled mowrne and be woe and sad
And many heirs live gyltles in dystres
While on worthy / has honor and riches
But such vile gifts may not be true plainly
Nor yet possesyd by law ryghtwysly
And sith few rowmys of lordly dygnyte
Be wone or holden with right and equity
Say what thing have they to give by law and right
Sith their chief tresour is won by wro^gful might
When se come their jewels their coin and cloth of price
Save most by rapyne and ^ellynge of justice
Else of saint Peter's / or crystes patrimony
Now few be founders / but confounders be many
These be no gifts / true honest nor laudable
Neither to the gyuer / nor taker profitable
These men call gifts / of none vtilyte
Which thus procedyth / of falls inequyte
Than leave we this vice / while all good men it hate
For covetous with coin be never sacyate
I hard sir Sampson say / but this other day
That Jerome and Seneke / does both this sentence say
That covetous wretches / not only want that thing
Which thy never had in title nor keeping
But that which they have also / they want and fail
Sith they it having of it have none avail
And as I remember / old Codrus said also
That gold naught helpyth when we must hence go
Skant have we pleasour / of it while we here tarry
And none can his store / nor glory with him carry
Thus ought we to live as having all in store
But naught possessynge or carynge naught therefore
What should christen men / seek ferther for riches
Having fode and clothe / it is ynought doutles
And these may our lord give unto us truly
Without pryncys service / or courtly mysery
Thus find we in court plain no riches at all
Or else find we such / with care contynuall
That it were better / no riches to have found
Than for false treasour / in thraldom to be bound

Coridon. Look up mate Cornix / behold in to the west
These wyndy clowdys / us thretnyth some tempest
My clothes be thyn / my sheep be shorn new
Such storm might fall / yt both might after rewe
Drive we out flocks unto our pore cotage
Tomorowe of court / we may have more langage
This day have thou told / and prouyd openly
That all such courters / does live in mysery
Which serve in the court / for honor lawde or fame
And might or power / thou prouyd have this same
And that all they live / depest in dystres
Which serve there / to win vain treasour or riches
As for the other two / and if ought more remain
Thou may tell tomorowe / wha^ we turn again

Cornix. I grant Coridon / take up thy bottell sone
Les is the burden / now that the drink is done
Lo here is a sport / our bottell is contary
To a Cowes utter / and I shall tell the why
With a full vtther retournyth home the cow
So does not the bottell / as it aperyth now
Coridon we must haste / in our journey make
Or else shall the storm / us and our sheep overtake

Finis.
Thus ends the first Egloge of the myseryes of the Courters compyled and
drawn by Alexander Barclay.
The second egloge
Hery be gynneth the second egloge of the myseryes of courters
Coridon. HOw fell this Cornix / why tarried thou so long
This is y^. iii^ day some thige is with the wrong
Else some perturbance of household besynes
Unto thy pasture has made the tend the les

Cornix. Codrus / the rychest shepherde of our cost
Which of his wethers is wont himself to boste
Unto a banquet friendly inuityd me
The same day after I did depart fro the
While I him helpyth his gestis for to chere
That has me causyth / so lately to be here

Coridon. Who fatly faryth with costly meat and drink
For warke behofull does little care or think
When full is the womb the bonys would have rest
Fie on such surfayt / fair temperaunce is best
My wyuys gray hen one egg laid every day
My wife fed her well / to cause her two to lay
But when she was fat than lay she none at all
I trow that like chance / be unto the befall
For now of thy flock thou have no mind nor care
Since time thy wyrtys were dullyd with fat fare

Cornix. Not so Coridon / for when I sowpe at home
I often go to bed / with faint and hungry womb
Than lie I slombrynge to win in sleap I think
That same which I lost for lack of meat and drink
But when I am fed than sleep I steadfastly
And after short rest / than work I lustely

Coridon. A bird well ingorged / kepys well her nest
A full belly askyth / a bed full of rest

Cornix. That is when diet / excedyth temporaunce
Than folowyth sloth and all mysgouernau^ce
As brawling babbling / dyscorde and lechery
Blasphemynge lyenge / crakynge and perjury
But as towchynge me because I want at home
When I am abroad I furnysshe well my womb
Yet more I take not than nature may sustain
And than sore work I it to dysgest again
So did I with Codrus till I am fatygate

Coridon. I wist well some thing made yt to come so late
Me list no longer to common of excess
But tell me Cornix / what was thy besynes

Cornix. The river began / the banks to over flow
At diverse parts where as the ground was low
For might of water will not our laysere bide
We feign were our shephe / for the time to set aside
And both day and night to put to our dylygence
For to overcome / the flodes violence
Streng thing our banks and heythynge the^ again
Which were abated / with flodes or great rain

Coridon. The earth in this point is like manners of men
From hye ground / water / dyscendyth to the fen
The hye mountaynnys / of water them dyscharge
And lade the ryuers with flodes great and large
Again the ryuers / dyschargyth them like wise
And chargyth the sea / so mennys common gyse
Is always to lay the burden or the sack
Which them sore greuyth upon some other back

Cornix. No thing is truer / than is this of the said
It is a true proverb and pretely conveyed

Coridon. But now thou art come I pray the heartily
Begin where thou left of courters mysery
The heuyn is clear the cowdes clean away
Which is a tokyn of cawm and pleasant day
The poyntyd burdys with pleasant tunes sing
The dewy flowers fresshly does smyle and spring
All thing reioysyth each thing does nature keep
Than were it great shame to us to s^ort and sleep
By merry taykynge / long season semyth short
In friendly spece / is solace and confort

Cornix. As I remember we spoke last of riches
Now talk we of lust or voluptuosnes
Forsothe some wretches of manners vile and rude
Have countyd in lust most hye beatitude
And namely the sect which follow epycure
Which shameful sect does to this day endure
Whom the philosophers and clerks now a days
Despise with wordys / yet follow they his ways
For what is that clerk or prelate in honor
Which clean dyspysyth all temporal pleasour
And therefore perchance if any such there be
Despysynge to look on fayrnes or beawte
Despysynge odours or sapour dylycate
And pleasant towchynge / despysynge in like ^ate
Some call the^ happy which can such thing exclude
But no men count them of manners dull and rude
For ii. diverse ways / does mannys life contain
The one of virtue / of dylygence and pain
The other of lust / of pleasour mirth and rest
The first despysynge men count ye second best
They way of virtue is roughe and desolate
With wede and thornys shyt for all men it hate
Few it frequentyth or follow in regard
For the first enter to them aperyth hard
The way of pleasour / is plain and euydent
And greatly worn / for many it frequent
The hard way of virtue / at end has quyetnes
They plain way of plesour has danger and distres
Yet were one hantyth the passage of virtue
For that one iiii. score their lustys does ensue

Coridon. These matters be hye and semyth me dyffuse
Draw to our purpose cause me no longer muse

Cornix. Though I now be poor and here no thing set by
Yet have I or this seen some philosophy
But the lack of use hurtyth al science
And wretchyd thraldom is enmy to pruden^^
What time the person is cuntyd as abiecte
Than langour makyth the wit of small effect
A famous doctor is blyndyd among foles
Only his valor is clerest in the scoles
A precious stone well cowchyd in pure gold
Is bright and comely / and goodly to behold
Throw it in the mire than is the beawte gone
And hyd for the time / both of the gold and stone
For lack of using a sword erst glasyd bright
With ^ust is etyn / made foul and black to sight
Right so my reason sometime fresshe to deuyse
Is now made rusty / for lack of exercise

Coridon. By this dysputynge thou may scour of the rust
Return now to speak of pleasour and of lust

Cornix. Many blind wretches / bide in the court labor
There wenynge to win / their lustys and pleasour
But it is a wonder and matter chief of all
To speak of their folly and appetyte rural
But first let us talk what pleasour is there seen
Which y^ v. wyttys beginning at the iyen

Coridon. That is troth Cornix right many thyngys be
Which men have pleasour and great delight to se
And these in the court be most in habundance

Cornix. Nay there has the sight / no manner of pleasance
And that shall I prove long time or it be night
Some men delytyth beholdynge men to fight
Or goodly knights / in pleasant apparayle
Or sturdy sowdiours in bright harnes and mayle
Or an army ready arrayed to the war
Or to se them fight so that he stand a far
Some glad is to se these ladies beauteous
Goodly apoyntyd in clothing sumptuous
A number of peopyll apoyntyd in like wise
In costly clothing after the newest gyse
Sportys / dysgysynge fair coursers mount and praunce
Or goodly ladies / and knights sing and dance
To se fair houses and curyous picture
Or pleasant hanging / or sumptuous vesture
Of sylke of purpure / or gold most oryent
And other clothing diverse and excellent
Hye curyous byldynge and palacys royal
Or chapels temples fair and substancyall
Images graven or va^ltes curyous
Gardyns and medows or place dylycyous
Forestes parkes / well furnysshed with dear
Cold pleasant streamys or wellys fair and clear
Curyous co^ductys / or shadowey mountayns
Sweet pleasant valleys / lawndys other playns
Hounds and such other things manyfolde
Some men take pleasour and solace to behold
But all these pleasours be much more iocounde
To pryuate personys / which not to court be bound
Than to such other which of necessyte
Or bound to the court / as in captyuyte
For they which be bound to princes without fail
When they must nedys be present in battle
There shall they not be / at large to se the sight
But as sowdyours / in mids of the fight
To rone here and there / sometime his fo to smite
And often times wounded / herin is small delight
And more must he think / his body to defend
Than for any pleasour / about him to intend
And often is he faint and betyn to the ground
I trow in such sight / small pleasour may be found
As for fair ladies / clothed in sylke and gold
In court at thy pleasour thou can not behold
At thy pryncys pleasour / thou shall them only se
Than such shall thou se which little set by the
Whose shape and beautye / may so enflambe thyn heart
That thought and langour may cause ye for to smart
For a small sparcle / may kendle love certain
But scantly Seuecne / may quench it clean again
And beautly blyndeth and causyth man to set
His heart on yt thing / which he shall never get
To se men clothed in sylkes pleasantly
It is small pleasour and often causyth envy
while thy lene Jade / halteth be thy side
To se another / upon a courser ride
Though he be neither gentylman nor knight
Nothing is thy fortune / thy heart can not be light
As thouchynge sportys and gamys of pleasance
To sing to revel and other dalyaunce
Who that will truly / upon his lord attend
Unto such pleasours he seldom may entende
Palaycys pyctures / and temples sumptuous
And other byldynge / both gay and curious
These may marchauntys more at their pleasour se
Than such as in court be bound always to be
Sith kings / for must part pas not their regyons
Thou see now Cytees / of foreyn nacyons
Such outward pleasours / may the peopyll se
So may not courters / for lack of lyberte
As for these pleasours / of things varyable
Which in the fyldes aperyth delectable
But seldom season may thou obtain respyte
The same to behold with pleasour and delight
Some time the courter remains half the year
Closse within wallys much like a prisoner
To make escapys / some seldom time a^wount
Save wha^ their princes has pleasour for to hu^t
Orels other wise them self to recreate
And than this pleasour shall they not love but hate
For than shall they forth most namely to the pain
When they in minds would at home remain
Other in the frost / hayle or else snow
Or wha^ some tempest or mighty wynd does blow
Or else in great heat and fervor excyssyfe
But closse in houses the most part wast their life
Of color faded / and cloked nere with dust
This is of courters the joy and all the lust

Coridon. What yet may they sing and with fair ladies dau^ce
Both common and lawghe / here in is some pleasance

Cornix. Nay nay Coridon / that pleasourys but small
Some and content / what man will pleasour call
For some in the daunse / her pyncheth by the hand
Which gladly would se him stretchyd in a band
Some galand sekyth / her favor to purchase
Which plain abhorryth for to behold his face
And still in dauncynge / most part inclynyth she
To one much vyler and more abject than he
No day over passyth but that in court men find
A thousand things / to vex and grieve their mind
Always thy foes / or present in thy sight
And often so great is their degree and might
That nedys must thou kys yt hand which did ye harm
Though thou would se it / cut gladly from the arm
And brefely to speak if thou to court resort
If thou se one thing of pleasour or confort
Thou shall se many before or thou depart
To thy dyspleasour and pensyfnes of heart
So fyndyth thy sight / there more of bytternes
And of dyspleasour / than pleasour and gladness

Coridon. As towchynge the sight now se I clear and plain
That men in the court shall find but care and pain
But yet me thinks as daily does apere
That men in the court may pleasant thyngys here
And by such meanys have delectacyon
While they here tidings and communycacyon
And all the chaunches and every newelte
As well of our Coost / as far beyond the sea
There men may here some that common of wysdom
For of men wysest / within the court be some
There be recountyd / and of men lernyd told
Famous chronicles of actys great and old
The worthy deeds of princes excellent
To move young princes / such acts to frequent
For when wise men dare not bad princes blame
For their myslyuynge / Me^alcas says this same
Of other princes / than lawde they the virtue
To styre their lords / such living to ensure
And while they commend / princes unworthily
To be commendable / they warn them secretly
All this may courters / in court often times here
And also songs of times sweet and clear
The bird of Cornewayle / the Crayne and the kyte
And mo other like to here it is delight
Warblynge of their tunys / at pleasour and at will
Though some be besy which have but little skyll
There men may here / much other melody
In sound ressemblynge an heuynly armony
Is this not pleasour / me think no mirth is scant
Where no reioysynge / of mynstrelsy does want
The baggepype / or fydell to us is delectable
Than is there solace more greatly commendable

Cornix. Thou art dysceyuyd / and so be many mo
Which for such pleasour / unto the court will go
But for these also / I must find remedy
Which sue to the court for lust of melody
They be mad folys / which to rejoice their erys
Will live in court more dreadful then with bearys
Instead of pleasour / such find but heaviness
They here small good / but much vnhapynes
As towchynge tidings / which thou do first abject
There much things is told / falls and of none effect
And more dyspleasour shall wysmen in them find
Than joy or pleasour to confort of their mind
These be tidings / in court most commonly
Or Cytees takyn / war / frawde / and tyranny
Good men subdued / or else by malice slain
And bad in their stead / have vyctory and reyne
Of spoylynge murder / oppressyon and rapyne
How law and justice / sore fallyth to ruin
Among the courters such neweltyes be told
And in mean season / they lawgh both young and old
While one recountyd / some deed abhomynable
Such other wretches / repute it commendable
But men of wysdom / well lernyd in scripture
Which talk of manners / or secret of nature
Or of hystoryes / their dysputacyon
Is swetely sawsyth / with adulacyon
They cloak the troth / their princes to content
To purchase favor and mind beneuolent
In sometime poets or orators ornate
Make orysons / before some great estate
It is not so sweet / to here them talking there
Where as their minds / be trowblyd often with fear
As in the scoles / where they at lyberte
Without all flaterynge / may talk plain veryte
For truly in courts / all communycacyon
Must needs have spyce of adulacyon
Such as be gylty / anon be mad and wroth
If one be so bold / plainly to say the troth
Therefore ill lyuers / oftymes lawdyd be
And men dyspraysed which love honest
And true hystoryes of acts anucyent
Be fally turned / some princes to content
And namely when such hystoryes testyfy
Blame or dyswourshyp / towchyng his progeny
Than new hystoryes be feigned of the old
With flatery painted / with lies many fold
Than some good scoler / without promocyon
Herynge such / glosyd communycacyon
Dare not be so bold / such lyenge to gaynsay
But laughe in his mind yet at the fool he may
And also in court / Actours not verytable
And lest of valor are counted most laudable
But Liuius / Salust and quintus curcius
Justinian / Plutarche / and Suetonius
With such noble auctours / and many other mo
In this time courters will have nothing to do

Coridon. Cornix / where have thou these strange namys sought


Cornix. I sought not in youth the world all for naught
Mynstreis and syngers be in the court like wise
And that of the best / and of the french gyse
Such men with pryncys / be seen more acceptable
Than men of wysdom and clerks venerable
For Phylosofers / Poets and Orators
Be seldom in court / had in so great honors
Wha^ thou feign would here / such folks play or sing
Nothing shall be done / of them at thy liking
But when it pleasyth thy princes them to call
Their sound ascendyth / to chamber and to hall
When thou would sleep or do some besynes
Than is their musyke to the unquietness
Yet bide their clamor and sound thou needs must
To thy great trouble and no pleasour or lust
This is of syngers the very properte
Always the couyte desired for to be
And when their friends would here of their co^nynge
Than ar they never dysposed for to sing
But if they begin desired of no man
Than show they all and more than they can
And never leave thy till men of them be weary
So in their conceyt / their conning they set by
And thus when a man would gladlyest them here
Than have they dysdayne / in presence to apere
And than when a man would take his eas and rest
Than none can void them they be in place so pressed
Yet nedys must thou exchewe season pryncypall
Reward such people / else art thou nough at all
For their dyspleasoure to the and pains hard
Lo such is ye court / thou must give them reward
Beside this / in court men here skant other thing
Save chiding / brawlyng / bannynge and curs^yn^
Echone is besy his felawe for to blame
There is blasphemynge of goddys holy name
Deuysynge othis with pleasour for the nonys
And often they speak together all at onys
So many clamours use they at every tide
That scant may thou here thy fellow be the side
They boste their sins / as past the fear of shame
Detractynge other men fawty in the same
One laudeth his land where he was bred and borne
At others contray having dysdayne and scorn
On each side soundyth foul speech of rybawdry
Uauntynge and bostynge of fynne and velany
No me sure manner nor shame / nor reverence
Have they in words in secret or presence
A rusty rybawd more vyler than a sow
Has in the court more audyence than thou
Some book / some brawle / some slander and bachyte
To here such manners can be but small delight
Except a wretch will confourme him to that sort
Than in such herynge his blyndnes has conforte
These scabbed scolyons may do and say their will
When men of wourshyp for very shame are still
Who that has wysdom would rather defe to be
Than daily to here such vile enormyte

Coridon. I se in herynge men in the court have no joy
Yet is it pleasour to handle and to toy
With Galatea Licoris or phyllys
Neera / Malkyn or lusty Testilis
And other damys / if coin be in the powche
Men may have pleasour them for to feel and towche
In court has venus her power pryncypall
For wymen vsyth to love them most of all
Which boldly bosteth / or that can sing and get
Which ar well decked with large busshes set
Which has the maystry / often time in tournament
Or that can gainbawd / or dance feat and gent
Or that can always be merry withouth care
With such can wymen / most chefely deal and fare
So may these courters in court some pleasour wyn
Duly in towchynge / and feeling their soft skyn

Cornix. Thou art abusyd / forsothe it is not so
Lovers in court have most of care and woe
Some wymen love them / inflamyde be vile lust
But yet very few / dare them believe or trust
For well know wymen / that courters chat and babble
They bost their sins / and ever be unstable
After their pleasour / than to the old adiwe
Than be they besy / to puruey for a new
This know all wymen / Some by experyence
So few to courters / give trust or confydence
Except it be such / as forsyth not her name
Or passed all fear / rebuke / or worldly shame
Than such a brouthell / her kepyth not to one
For many courters / ensues her alone
And none shall thou love of this vile sort parde
But that she louyth another more then the
And than as often / as partynge fellows mete
They chyde and brawle though it be in the street
Hatered and strife / and fighting comes after
^ffu^y on of blood / and oftentyme manslaughter
Thou can no woman / keep straight and nygardly
To whom many one does promise largely
Another shall come / more fresshe and gayly decte
Than has he favor / and thou art clean abiecte
When thou haste wasted thy money / name and sede
Than shall y^ have naught save a mok for thy mede
Thou art the nynthe / wenynge to be alone
For none of this sort / can be content with one
Yet shall she feign her chaste as penolope
Though she love twenty as well as she does the
And each for his time shall have a merry look
Se syghyth as she great sorrow for them took
With feigned tears / she moysteth often thy lap
Till time that thy purse be taken in a trap
And if she perceive that all thy coin is gone
Than dance at the door / adieu gentle Johu^
And often when thou ghost to vysyte thy lemman
With her shall thou find / some other Joly man
Than shall she make the for to believe none other
But he is her fader / her uncle or her brother
But plainly to speak / he brother is tho the
If kynred may rise / of such iniquite
Again to her house / if that thou after rome
Than shall thou find / that she is not at home
But gone to some other / which for rebuke and shame
Durst not come to her / for hurtynge of his name

Coridon. Here is a ruell / this does excede my mind
Who would think this gyle / to be in woman^kynde
But yet man parde / some be as good within
As they be outward in beauty of the skyn
Of this cursed sort / they can not be echone
Some be which keep them to one lover alone
As penolope / was to her Ulires
Think on what Codrus / recountyd of lucres
Though she not willing was falsely violat
With her own hands procured she her fate

Cornix. It were a great wounder a monge the wymen all
If none were part^es / of lust venerall
I grant some chaste / what time they can not choose
As when all men their company refuse
Or when she knowyth / her vice should be detect
Than of myslyuynge / auoydyth she the sect
And though in ye world / some women may thou find
Which chastely live / of their own proper kind
Or that can keep her self only to one
Yet is with such / of pleasour small or none
To her at pleasour thou can not resort
In pleasour stollyn / but small is the conforte
Neither may thou long with such one remain
And in short pleasour departing in great pain
To her may thou come but only now and than
By stelth and stertys / as pryuey as thou can
To love and thy lord may thou not serve together
If so thy wit is dystract thou w^t not whether
Thy lord does chalange to him thy hole service
And the same does love chalange in like wise
Not only it is hard in the court to save
Thy lemmad chaste / with her pleasour to have
But also / it is extreme dyffyculte
Thyn own wife in court to keep in chastyts
For flaterynge wowers / on every side apere
And lusty galandes of fair dystymulyd chere
Some promise gold and gifts great or small
Some hasty galand is yet before them all
So many wowers / bawdys and brokers
Flatterers liars and hasty proferes
Be always in court / that chaste penolope
Could skant among them preserve her chastyte
So great temptacyon / no woman may resyste
In heavenly power / her might do not assyste
For craft and coin / flatery and instaunce
Tourneth chaste minds / to vile mysgouernaunce
Though she be honest / yet must thou leave thy love
Sith princes courts / contynually remove
Then Whether she be thy wife or concubyne
Her care and dolor is great / and so is thine
For neither may thou / there still with her abide
Nor led her with the / or keep her be thy side
When thou art gone / if she behind remain
Than fear the trowblyth / with tourme^t and with pain
By cause that the mind / of women is onstable
Always thou doubtest / lest she be chauugeable
And I assure the / if man be out of sight
The mind of woman / to return is very light
Onys out of sight / and shortly out of mind
This is their manner / apere the never so kind
Add to all these / scorn and derysyon
Which thou may suffer / and great suspeccyon
Infamy / sclaunder / and preuey Jalowsy
These must thou suffer without all remedy
And other dangers mo than a man can think
While other slepyth / the lover skant does wynke
Who has these prouyd / shall none of them desire
For children brent / still after dredyth fire
Sith that the se things / to all men be grievous
They be to courts / yet most dammagyous
Most paynfull noyons / and plainly importable
In court them feeling / has no thing delectable

Coridon. I se the pleasour / of towchynge is but small
I thought it honey / I se now it is gall
Now speak on Cornix I pray the brefely tell
What joy have courters / in tastynge or to smell
For these two wits / in court be recreate
Else many wretchys / be there infatuat

Cornix. The smell and tastynge / partly conjoined be
And part dysioyned / as I shall tell to the
For while we receive / some meatys delycate
The smell and tastynge / than both be recreate
The fragraunt odor / and ointment of sweet flour
Only delytyth / the smelling with odor
Of meat delycyous / gone is both smell and taste
When it is chewyd / and through the gorge past
But they which in mouth / have pleasour pryncypall
Or beestly folys / and of living brutall
The famous shepherde / whom Nero did behede
Them greatly blamyth / which beestly use to feed
Which for their womb chief care and labor take
And of their belyes / ar wont their god to make

Coridon. A god of the womb / that hard I never ere


Cornix. Coridon / thou art not to old for to lere
I plainly shall now declare for thy sake
Now beestly glottons god of their wombes make
To god ar men wont / temples to edyfye
And costly auters to ordain semblably
To ordain mynysters / to execute service
To offer beestes / by way of sacryfyce
To burn in temples / well smelling ensence
Glottons to the womb / do all this reverence

Coridon. They and their gooddes come to confucyon
Which forgeth ydolys / by such abusyon
But proceed Cornix / tell on in wordys plain
How all these things / they to the womb ordain
Which is in temple / the auter and insence
And the mynysters / to do their dylygence
Within the temple to keep always service
And to the belly which is the sacryfyce

Cornix. To god of the belly / glotons a temple make
Of the smoky kechyn / for temple it they take
Within this temple / mynystre / bawdy cooks
And young scolyons / with fendes of their lokes
The solemn awter / is the board or table
With dysshes charged / twenty in a rabble
The beestes offcyd / in sacryfyce or host
In diverse sorts / of sodyn and of roste
The saw is ensence / or of the mete the smell
And of this temple / these be the chief vessel
Platers and dysshes / mortar and pot crokys
Pottis and pestels / broches and flesh hokes
And many mo else / than I count or tell
They know them best which with the kyche^ mell
For god of the womb / this service men prepare
As for their true god / full little is their care

Coridon. This life is beestly / and utterly damnable


Cornix. But yet it is now reputed comendable
Princes and commons and some of relygyon
Unto this temple have chief devotion
To cokes and tauernes some erlyer frequent
Than unto service of god omnipotent
First serve the belly / than after serve our lord
Such is the world / though it do ill accord
And such as delytyth / in beestly glotony
Folowith the court / supposing steadfastly
With mete and with drink / to stofe well the paunche
Whose lust insacyate / no flode of hell can staunche
And for that princes use / costely mete and wine
These folys suppouse / to feed them with as fine
To ete and to drink / as sweet and delycate
As does their princes or other great estate
Like wise as flies / does follow and thycke swarm
About ^at paunches / unto their utter harm
So such men as have / in glotony confort
To lords kechyns most besely resort
With hungry throtys / yet go the often away
And often have the flies much greater part than they

Coridon. Than tell on Cornix / what confort and pleasour
Men fyndyth in court in tastynge and savor
With meat and drink / how they their wombes fill
And whether thy speed / at pleasour and at will

Coridon. To ete and to drink / than is most joy and lust
When men be hungry or greuyd sore with trust
But often unto nowne / must thou abide respyte
Than tournyd is hounger / to doggys appetyte
For plain wood houngry that time is many one
That some would gladly be gnauynge on a bone
On which vile currys has gnawen on before
His purs is empty and houngre is so sore
Or some by feebleness and weary taryenge
Lose their appetyte / that they can ete nothing
Some other has etyn / some bread and chese before
That at their dinner / they lust to eat no more
Their stomach stopyd and closyd with some crust
From them has takyn / their appetyte and lust
Than other courters of manners beestyall
With gredy mouths deuowreth more than all
Thus some at rysynge be fuller then be swyne
And some for hunger again may syte and dyne
Sometime to gyder must thou both dyne and sup
And sometime thou dynest before the son be up
But if thou refuse to ete before day light
Than must thou tarry and fast till it be night
To ete or to drink than is it small delight
When no dysgestyon has styred appetyte
Again art thou set to sowper all to late
All thing has season which men of court not hate
For never shall thy meat be set to in the season
Where of procedyth much sore vexacion
Often age intestate departed suddenly
And lusty galandes departyth semblably
Here of procedyth / the vomyte and the stone
And other syknesse many mo than one
Sometime is the wine sour / watery and so bad
That only the color might make a man be mad
Cold without mesure / or hot as horse pys
Bad is the color / the savor badder is
But if in the court thou drink / both bear and ale
Than is the color trowbled / blake and pale
Think not to drink it / in glass / silver or gold
The one may be stollyn / the other can not hold
Of a treyn vessel / than must thou nedy drink
Old blake and rusty / lately takyn fro some synke
And in such vessel drink / shall thou of tentyme
Which in the bottom / is full of fylth and slyme
And of that vessel / thou drynkest often I wys
In which some statis / or damys late did pys
Yet shall thou not have / a cup at thy delight
To drink of allone / at will and appetyte
Coridon in court / I tell the by my soul
For most part / thou must drink of a common bowse
And where greasy lyppes / and slymy berde
Has late ben depyd / to make some man aferde
On that side must thou thy lyppys wasshe also
Or else without drink / from dinner must thou go
In the mean season / old wine and derely bought
Before thy presence / shall to thy prince be brought
Whose smell and odor / so sweet and marvelous
With fragrant savor / inbawnyth all the house
As muscadell capryke / romney and maluesy
From Genes / brough from greece or hungarry
Such shall he drink / such shall to him be brought
Thou have the savor / thy part of it is naught
Though thou should perysike / for very ardent thrust
No drop thou gettest / for to esclacke thy lust
And though good wynes / sometime to the be brought
The taste of better / shall cause it to seem naught
Often would thou drink / yet dare thou not sup
Till time thy better have tastyd of the cup
No cup is filled / till dinner half be done
And some mynystres / it countyth than to sone
But if thou begin for drink / to call and crave
Thou for thy calling such good reward shall have
That men shall call the malapert or drunk
Or an abbey lowne / or lymner of a monk
But with thy rebuke / yet art thou never the nere
Whyther thou demand / wine pallydale or bear
Yet shall thou not drink / wha^ thou have need and thrust
The cup must thou spare / ay / for thy betters lust
Thy ough many hands shall pas the pees or cup
Before or it come to the / is all drunk up
And than if a drope / or two therein remain
To lycke the vessel / sometime thou art full feign
And than at the ground / some fylth if thou espy
To blame the butler / thou gettest but envy
And as men wekely / new holy water pour
And onys in a year / the vessel use to scour
So cupes and tankerdes in court as thou may think
Where in the commons / ar vsyd for to drink
Or onys in the year / empty and made clean
And scantly that well / as oftentyme is seen
For to ask water / thy wynes to alley
Thou find shall no need / if thou before assay
With rynsynge of cupes / it tempered is before
By cause pure water / perchance is not in store

Coridon. Fie on this manner / such service I defye
I se that in court is unclean penury
Yet here though our drink / be very thine and small
We may thereof plenty have when we call
And in clean vessel / we drink thereof parde
Take here the bottell Cornix / assay and se

Cornix. Than call for the pressed / when I refuse to drink
This ale brewet / bentlye it makes me to wynke

Coridon. Thou say troth Cornix / believe me by the rode
No hand is so sure / that can always make good
But talk of the court / if thou have any more
Set down the bottell / save some lycour in store

Cornix. God bliss the brewer / well colyd is my throat
Now might I for need / sing hyer by a note
It is bad water / that cannat allay dust
And very sour ale / that can not quench thrust
How rowlyth my tunge / now that I without pain
Now here me I enter into the court again
Behold in the court / on common table clothys
So vile and ragged that some his dinner lothys
Touch them / then shall they unto thy fyngers cleue
And than must thou wype / thy hands on thy slyue
So he which daily fares in this gyse
Is so imbrued / and noynted in such wise
That as many men / as on his scyrtes look
Count him a scolyon / or else a gresy cook

Coridon. Yet Cornix / again / all courtynge I defy
More clennes is kept / within some hogs sty
But yet mate Cornix all be not thus I wene
For some table clothes be kept wit and clean
Fyner than sylke / and changed every day

Cornix. Coridon forsothe / it is as thou do say
But these be things / most chief and pryncypall
Only reserved / for greattest men of all
As for other clothes / which serve the comonte
Such as I told the / or else vyler be
And still remain the / unto the planke cleuynge
So black / so bawdy / so foul and ill semynge
Of sight and of sent / vile and abhomynable
Till skant may a man discern them from the table
But now here what meat / there needs ete thou must
And than if thou may to it apply thy lust
Thy mete in the court / is neither swanne nor heron
Curlewe nor crane / but cowrs befe and motton
Fat porke or vele / and namely such is bought
For easyer price / when they be lene and naught
Thy flesh is reesty / or lean towgh and old
Or it come to board / onsauery and cold
Sometime twyse sodden / unclean without taste
Sawsed with coals / and ashes all for haste
When thou it etyst / it smellyth so of smoke
Than every morsel / is able one to choke
Make hunger thy sawse / be thou never so nyse
For there shall thou find none other sawse ne spyce
Thy potage is made with wedes and with ashes
And between thy tethe / of time the coals crasshes
Sometime half sodden / is both thy flesh and broth
The watter and herbs / together be so wroth
That each goth a part / they can not well agree
And often be they salt / as water of the sea
Seldom at chese / have thon a little lycke
And if thou ought have / within it shall be quycke
All full of magottys and like to the raynbowe
Of diverse colors / as read grene and yelowe
On each side grawen / with myse or with rattys
Or with vile worms / with dogs or with cattys
Unclene and scurfy / and hard as the stone
It looks so well / thou would it were gone
If thou have butter / than shall it be as ill
Or worse than thy chese / but hungar has no skyll
And when that eggs / half hatched be almoost
Than are they for the / laid in the fire to roost
If thou have pearys / or apples by thou sure
Than be they such as might no more endure
And if thou none ete / they be so good and fine
That after dinner / they serve for the swyne
Thy oil for fryenge is for the lamps mete
A man it chokyth / the savor is so sweet
A cordwayners shop / and it have equal sent
Such pain and penance / acordyth best to lent
Such is of this oil / the savor peryllous
That it might / serpents drive out of an house
Oftyme thy stomach it causith to reboke
And of it is ready / the suddenly to choke
Of fysshe in some court / thy chief and vsyd dysshe
Is whytynge hexynge / saltfysshe and stockfysshe
If the day be solemn / parchaunce thou may feel
The taste and the sapour / of tenche or ele
Their muddy sapour shall make thy stomach ache
And as for the ele / is cosyn to a snake
But if better fysshe / or any dysshes more
Come to thy part / it naught was before
Corrupt ill smelling and. v. days old
For sent thou can not receive it if thou would
Thy bread is black / of ill sapour and taste
And hard as a flynt / because thou none should wast
That skant be thy tethe abyll it to brake
Deep it in potage / if thou no shyft can make
And though white and brown / be both at one price
With brown shall y^ feed lest white might make y^ nyce
The lordys will always that people note and se
Between them and servants some dyuersyte
Though it to them turn to no profit at all
If they have pleasour / the servant shall have small
Thy dysshes be one contynnynge the year
Thou know what meat before the^ shall apere
This slakyth great part / of lustys and pleasour
Which asks dentyes much diverse of sapour
On one dysshe daily needs shall thou blow
Till thou be as weary as dog of the bow
But this might be suffered / may fortune easily
If thou saw not sweter meats to pas by
For this unto courters / most commonly does hape
That while they have brown bread and chese i their lape
On it fast gnawynge as hounds ravenous
Anon by them passyth of meat delycyous
And costely dysses a score may they tell
Their gredy gorgys ar rapt with the smell
The deynteous dysshes / which pas through ye hall
It were great labor for me to name them all
And Coridon all if I would it were but shame
For sympyll shepherdes such deyntyes to name
With brown bread and chese / the shepherde is content
And skant se we fysshe / past onys in the lent
And other seasons / soft chese is our fode
With boter and cream than is our dinner good
And milk is our mirth / and special appetyte
In apples and plommys / also is our delight
These fill the belly all if we hunger sore
Wha^ man has enough what nedyth him have more
But when these courters sit on the benches ydyll
Smelling those dysshes they byte on the brydyll
And than is their pain and anger fell as gall
When all passyth by / and they have naught at all
What fysshe is of savor / sweet and delycyous
While you sore hungrest / thy prince has plenteous
Rostyd or sodden in sweet herbs and wine
Or fried in oil / most saporous and fine
Such fysshe to behold and none thereof to taste
Pure envy causyth hye heart nere to brast
Than seeing his dysshes of flesh new again
Thy mind has tourme^t yet with much great pain
Well may thou smell the pastyes of a heart
And diverse dentyes / but naught shall be thy part
The crane / the fesant / the pecocke and curlewe
The partryche / plouer / byttore and heronsewe
Each bird of the air and beestes of the ground
At princes table / shall thou behold habounde
Season d so well in lycour redolent
That the hall is full of pleasant smell and sent
To se such dysshes / and smell the sweet odor
And nothing to taste / is utter dyspleasour

Coridon. Yes somewhat shall come / who can his time abide
And thus may I warn / my fellow by my side
What ete soft dromo / and have not so great have
For shortly we shall some better morfell taste
Soft man and spare thou / a courner of thy belly
A none shall be sent us some little dysshe of Jely
A leg of a swan / a partryche or twain

Cornix. Nay nay Coridon / thy bydynge is in vain
Thy thought shall vanysshe / such dysshes be not small
For common courters / of them has naught at all
To thy next fellow / some morsel may be sent
To thy dyspleasour great anguysshe and tourment
Whereby in thy mind thou may suspect and trow
Him more in favor and in conceyt than thou
And sometime to the is sent a little crape
With savor thereof to take the in a trape
Not to alay / thy hunger and desire
But by the swetnes / to set the more on fire
Beside all this sorrow / incresyd is thy pain
When thou beholdest before thy lord pain main
A baker chosen and wagyd well for thy
That only he should that besynes apply
If thou one manchet / dare handyll other touch
By cause of duty to thrust it in thy pouche
Than shall some sloueyn / the dasshe on the ere
Thou shrynkest for shame thy bread leuynge there

Coridon. My bag full of stony and hoke in my hand
Should give me a cowrage such boldly to with stand

Cornix. Not so Coridon / they fare like to curres
Together they cleue more fast than do burres
Though echone with other often chyde brawle and fight
Against a pore stranger they show al their might
It is a great mastry for Coridon alone
To strive or comende / with many mo than one
A straw for thy wysdom and artys lyberall
For favor and coin in court works all
Thy princes apples be sweet and oryent
Such as Minalcas unto Amyntas sent
Or such as Agros did in his keeping hold
Of fragrant sapour and color like pure gold
In sauowre of whom thou only have delight
But if thou should dye no morssell shall thou byte
His chese is costly / fat pleasant and wholesome
Though thy tethe water / thou etest not a crome
Upon the sewer / well may thou gase and gape
While he is fyllyd / thy hunger is a Jape
Before thy sovereign shall the keruar stand
With diverse gesture / his knyfe in his hand
Dysmembrynge a crane / or somewhat deynteous
And though his parsell be fat and plenteous
Though unto diverse / thou se him cut and kerue
Thou gettest no gobbet / though you should dye and sterue
In all that thy sight has delectacyon
Thy gredy tastynge / has great vexacron
What man will believe / that such wretchyd thing
A courter may find his pleasour or living
What man is he but rather would assent
That in such living is anguysshe and tourment
May not their tourment be well compared thus
Unto the tourment of wretchyd Tantalus
Which as said Fawstus / whose saying I may think
In flode and fruytys / may neither ete nor drink
Ancient poets / this Tantalus do feign
In hell condemnyd to suffer such pain
That up to the chyn / in water does he stand
And to his upper lyp / retche apples a thousand
But when he would drink / the water does dyscende
And when he would ete / the apples does ascend
So both fruit and water them kepyth at a stent
In mids of pleasour have courters like tourme^t
But now to tell table for to return again
There have thou yet another grievous pain
That when other talk / and speak what they will
Thou dare not whysper / but as one dom be still
And if thou ought speak / pryuey or aperte
Thou art to besy / and called malaperte
If thou call for ought by word sign / or beck
Tha^ Jacke with the busshe shall tant the with a check
One recheth the bread with grutche and murmuring
If thou of some other demand any thing
He has at thy asking great scorn and dysdayne
By cause yt thou syttest while he standyth in pain
Sometime the seruauntys be blind and ignorant
And spy not what thing upon the board does want
If they se a fawt / they will it not attend
By neglygent scorn / dysdaynynge it to mende
Sometime thou want other bread or wine
But naught dare thou ask if you should never dyne
Demand salt trenchour spone or other thing
Than art thou unportune / and ever more crauynge
And so shall thy name be spread to thy pain
For at the shall all have scorn and dysdayne
Sometime art thou erkyd of them at the table
But much more art thou of the serving rabble
The hungry seruers / which at the table stand
At every morsel / has iye unto thy hand
So much on thy morsel dystract is their mind
They gape wha^ thou gapyst / often bytynge y^ wind
By cause that thy leuyngys / is only their part
If thou feed the well / sore grieved is their heart
Namely of a dysshe costly and deynteous
Each piece that thou cuttest to them is tedyous
Than at the cupborde / one does another tell
Se how he fedeth / like the devil of hell
Our part he eteth / naught good shall we taste
Than pray they to god that it be thy last

Coridon. I had lever Cornix go souperles to bed
Than at such a fast / to be so bested
Better it is / with chese and bread one to fill
Than with great deynte / with anger and ill will
Or a small handful / with rest and sure pleasance
Than twenty dysshes / with wrathful countenance

Cornix. That can Amyntas record and testefy
But yet is in court / more pain and mysery
Brought in / by dysshes the table for to fill
But not one is brought / in order at thy will
That thou would have first / and love pryncypall
Is brought to the board / of times last of all
With bread and rude mete / when thou art sacyate
Than comes dysshes / most sweet and delycate
Than must thou other despise them utterly
Or to thy hurt / surfeit / ensuynge glotony
But if it fortune / as seldom does befall
That at beginning come dysshes best of all
Or thou have tasted / a morsel other twain
Thy dysshe out of sight / is taken sone again
Slow be the seruers / in serving in always
But swyft be they / after taking thy meat away
A special costom / is vsyd them among
No good dysshe to suffer on board to be long
If the dysshe be pleasant / other flesh or fysshe
Ten hands at onys / swarm in the dysshe
And if it be flesh ten knyues shall thou se
Manglynge the flesh and in the platter fle
To put there thy hand is peril without fail
Without a gantelet or else a glove of mayle
Among all these knyues / thou one of both must have
Or else is it hard / thy fyngers hole to save
Often in such dysshes in court is it seen
Some leave their fyngers / each knyfe is so kene
On a finger gnawyth some hasty gloton
Supposing it a pees / of befe or of motton
Beside these in court mo pains shall thou se
At board be men set / as thycke as they may be
The platters shall pas of times to and fro
And over the sholders / and head shall they go
And often all the brothe and lycour fat
Is spylt on thy gown / thy bonet and thy hat
Sometime art thou thrust / for little rowme and place
And sometime thy fellow reboketh in thy face
Between dysshe and dysshe / is tarry tedyous
But in y^ mean time / though you have pain grievous
Neither may thou rise / cough / spyt / or nese
Or take other easeme^t / lest thou thy name may lose
For such as this wise / to eas them ar wont
In nombre of rascaldes / courters them count
Of mete is none hour / nor time of certente
Yet from beginning / absent if thou be
Other shall thou lose / thy meat and kys the post
Or if by favor thy sowper be not lost
Thou shall at lest way rebukes sour abide
For not attendynge and faylynge of thy tide
Onyons or garlyke / which stamped Testyles
Nor yet sweet lekes / may thou not etc ywys

Coridon. What forsake garlyke / lekys and butter sweet
Nay rather would I go to Ely on my fete
We count these deyntyes / and meats very good
These be chief dysshes / and ruall mennys food

Cornix. Who court frequenteth / must love the dysshes sweet
And lords dysshes / to him ar no thing mete
As for our metys they may not ete I think
By cause great lords may not abide the stynke
But yet lords syege / and ruall mennys or dure
Be like of savor / for all their meats pure
As for common meatys / of them pleasour is small
By cause one service / of them contynuall
Allayeth pleasour / for voluptuosyte
Will have of dysshes change and dyuersyte
And when thou have smellyd meat more delycyous
Thy course daily fare / to the is tedyous
Now Judge Coridon / if here in be pleasour
Me think it anguysshe sorrow and dolor
Contynuall care and vter mysery
Affliceyon of heart / and wretchyd penury
But many folys think it is nothing so
While they se courters out ward so gayly go
The coursers seruantys cloch silver and gold
And other like things / delight they to behold
But nough they regard / the inward mysery
Which them oppressyth in court contynually
And as says Seueke / some count them fortunate
Which outward apere / well clothed or ornate
But if thou beheld their inward wretchydnes
Their daily trouble / their fruytles besynes
Than would thou count them both vile and miserable
Their rowme and office / both falls and desceyuable
For like as men paynt / old wallys ruynous
So by they payntyd / their life contraryous
And therefore all they which serve in court gladly
For taste or smelling / or spyce of glotony
Have like more wretchyd / than burgyes or merchant
Which with their wives have love and life pleasant
Shepherdes have not so wretchyd life as they
Though they leave porely on cruddes chese and whey
On apples plommes / and drink clear watter deep
As it were lords reynynge among their sheep
The wretchyd lasar / with clynkynge of his bell
Has life which does the courters life excel
The caytyf beggar has meat and lyberte
When courters hunger / in hard captyuyte
The poor man beggyth / nothing hurtynge his name
As towchig courters they dare not beg for shame
And an old proverb is said by men most sage
That often young courters be beggars in their age
Thus all those wretchys / which does y^ court frequent
Bring not to purpos their minds nor intent
But if their minds and will were sacyate
They are not better / thereby nor fortunate
Than all be folys concludynge with this clawse
Which with glad minds use courtyng for such cause

Coridon. Now truly Cornir / right plainly have thou told
Of court and courters / the pains many fold
And as I suppose there can no more remain
Thy wit and council has ryd me fro great pain
If I had plenty of treasour and riches
I should or I went reward thy besynes
But need often hurts good manners commendable

Cornix. What man woll gladly give / that is not able
But one habundynge in treasour and riches
Is ware in gyuynge / or yet to make promise
Thy will is enough / sith that thy store is thyn
I ask of the fox no ferther than the skyn
But long is to night / therefore I shall gladly

Coridon. What more yet declare of courtly mysery
Thou have told enough / by all these crosses ten
Almost for to choke upon a thousand men

Cornix. That I promised / right would I should fulfill
Yet more shall I towche / if thou can hold y^ still
I said first that some / but they be sawyn thyn
Resort unto the court / there sowles for to win
For with great princes / while such men remain
They Think by counsel by besynes and pain
Thefely to labor for the vtylyte
Of diverse causys towchynge the comonte
Pore men supporting / and children faderles
And helping wydowes / also in their dystres
So much more wenynge / to pleas our lord thereby
Because they contend in pain and Jeopardy
Of these must I cure / the minds ignorant
Which be more folys than all the remenant
All if they repute themself / never so sage
Yet shall I prove themself stuffyd with dotage

Coridon. Declare that Cornix / that feign would I here
We have time enough / yet does the son apers

Cornix. Of this foresaid sort / scant any find we shall
But that requires some lucre temporal
But nevertheless / now feign we such a one
Which seeks in court for no promocyon
But only intend / there sowles for to win
And as a champyon / to fight against syn
Sold wise men suppose in court so to prevail
Lost is their labor / their stody and travail
Or should a good man / which loves honest
Put him in thraldom / or in captyuyte
Of princes service / his soul to win thereby
Say men what them list / me thynkyth y^ contrary
For in court required / so many a syn and vice
And so many ways / from virtue to attyse
And so many meanys / ledynge to vicyousnes
That there may a man / skant bide in his goodness
For as a bad horse / resty and flyngynge
Often kestyth a man / though he be well sitting
In like manner wise man and rygghtwyse
Resorting to court / dyscendyth unto vice
All if his reason and will also deny
In court has the fend / such frawde and polesy
By mean that vices have there no punysment
For lust and suffrance / make minds insolent
But syn and sinners / lie daily so in wait
Against good living / to lay their deadely bayte
That the best lyuers / from way of grace declyne
By there occasyon / impellyth to ruin
He fallyth in rockys / and peril consequent
By force of tempest and wyndes vyolent

Coridon. What man in court is neytheyr roke nor sand
Dyffusly thou spekyst / and to understand

Cornix. I speak in parable / or by symylytude
Who not perceyuyth his reason is but rude
But mate Coridon / I tell the before
That what I shall say or yet have close in store
Of diverse auctours / I lernyd of Codrus
And he it lernyd / of shepherd Siluius
This Codrus said / that Plato the great sage
Of Athenence court / aduertynge the outrage
Purposyd rather to fle to solytude
Than live in honor among such vices rude
Than know well thy self / what so ever thou be
Which to sue the court have thy felicyte
And note if thy self be better than plato
Note well the power if thou have will also
As well as Plato / ill costom to refrain
If thou so thynkest / thou thynkest thing in vain
In court must a man / sail after every wind
Himself conformynge / to every manners mind
Serve every season / confourme him to the time
Be common with mo / though it be in some crime
He must rule nature and yet he wot not whither
After the season / now hither and now thither
And in his manner he must dyrect his lyse
With heavy persons / him must he show pensyfe
With men at leyser / which will them recreate
He must be ioconde / after their use and rate
With aged persons / he must him have sadly
With youth behave him iocounde and merely
With auenturous men / which seek on cruelte
He must show him blood and of audacyte
With lyuers beestly / insuynge carnal lust
Live lecherously / forsothe he nedys must
And who so refuses than is his nature wrong
He shall not in the court rise nor continue long
But Coridon / thou might object unto me more
That y^ said Plato / which fled from court before
Came long while after / and was in the service
Of Dionisius / the Tyran of Sily^e
It is as thou say / but harken to the end
This Tyrannys vice / while he did reprehende
All if the Tyran counted his name divine
As under color / to follow his doctrine
The cruel Tyran / his malice to fulfill
Sold this same Plato / mawgre his mind and wit
But thus entreatyd / was Plato not alone
The wrath of princes proved have many one
And namely of such as wysest were I wys
As ^enon murdered / by Tyran Phalaris
His godly wysdom / nor honor of his age
Could him not socoure / so did the Tyran rage
Arracreontes / sometime of Cypres king
Slew Anaragoras / for all his great conning
And by commandment / of Theodoricus
Without all mercy / slain was Boecius

Coridon. These be far matters and things very old


Cornix. Even such they be / as Codrus to me told
And yet many mo / he countyd to me plain
Of worthy clerks / whom fell princes has slain
But all to recount / me think it is not best
That askyth leyser / the son is nere at rest
Scant time remains / to tell that is beside
Except we purpose here all the night abide

Coridon. Late at our church ale / sir Sampson to me told
A tale of moses and other Prophets old
How the same moses and many of like sort
To princes courts did oftentyme resort
He said that moses though he of tongue were rude
Left his hole flock / behind in solytude
And he with Aaron / together both did go
On goddys message unto king Pharao
Also sir Sampson recounted unto me
A like narracyon of prophet Helyse
But Cornix / my mind is much obliuyous
And long hystoryes to here be tedious

Cornix. As touching moses and many prophetys mo
I granute / they were wont to princes for to go
These men were godly / it folly were to say
That all men should have such privilege as they
These were messangers of god of Izraell
And find can we not / that they in court did dwell
But when they had said gods commandment
They left both court and princes in continent
Joseph alonly / abode with Pharao
Thordinance of god had erst dysposed so
To help his nacyon / in time after to come
By his prouisyon / and marvelous wisdom
I grant the also / Mawricius and Martyne
Sebastian / George and other men dyuyne
Served in court and vsyd chyua^ry
And nevertheless / thy lived holely
But this Mawricius did chrystened become
And with his legion / received marterdome
Like wise sayut George and saint Sebastian
Dyspysynge ydo^tes which courtys used than
Suffered hard death by many fold tourment
For love and true faith of god omnipotent
But during the time / these did in the court remain
No namys of saints / men gave to them sertayne
And holy martyn / when he was come to age
Gave over the court / and fyxed his cowrage
In goddys service / remaining steadfastly
For he perceived / and knew right perfytely
That of pore wydowes and children faderles
The cause not entryth in to the court doutles
Their matters quealeth / for sold is all justice
And every speech / of rybaudry and vice
Also in courts / of mercy found is naught
And of relygyon / no sele if it were sought
Envy possessyth the place of charity
Only Ambicion has there auctoryte
These vices to resyste / passyth humayne doctrine
Man they overcome / except wysdom dyuyne
If god do not socoure it passyth mannys might
With such occasyon / contynually to fight
This knew saint Martyn / by sight contynuall
Yet naught him mouyd by help celestial
And though he lived in court right holely
He would no longer ensue that chyua^ry
And yet many mo / he countyd to me plain
Of worthy clerks / whom fell princes has slain
But all to recount / me think it is not best
That askyth leyser / the son is nere at rest
Scant time remains / to tell that is beside
Except we purpose here all the night abide

Coridon. Late at our church ale / sir Sampson to me told
A tale of moses and other Prophets old
How the same moses and many of like sort
To princes courts did oftentyme resort
He said that moses though he of tongue were rude
Left his hole flock / behind in solytude
And he with Aaron / together both did go
On goddys message unto king Pharao
Also sir Sampson recounted unto me
A like narracyon of prophet Helyse
But Cornix / my mind is much obliuyous
And long hystoryes to here be tedious

Cornix. As touching moses and many prophetys mo
I granute / they were wont to princes for to go
These men were godly / it folly were to say
That all men should have such privilege as they
These were messangers of god of Izraell
And find can we not / that they in court did dwell
But when they had said gods commandment
They left both court and princes in continent
Joseph alonly / abode with Pharao
Thordinance of god had erst dysposed so
To help his nacyon / in time after to come
By his prouisyon / and marvelous wisdom
I grant the also / Mawricius and Martyne
Sebastian / George and other men dyuyne
Served in court and vsyd chyua^ry
And nevertheless / thy lived holely
But this Mawricius did chrystened become
And with his legion / received marterdome
Like wise saint George and saint Sebastian
Dyspysynge ydo^tes which courtys used than
Suffered hard death by many fold tourment
For love and true faith of god omnipotent
But dutynge the time / these did in the court remain
No namys of saints / men gave to them sertayne
And holy martyn / when he was come to age
Gave over the court / and fyxed his cowrage
In goddys service / remaining steadfastly
For he perceived / and knew right perfytely
That of pore wydowes and children faderles
The cause not entryth in to the court doutles
Their matters quealeth / for sold is all justice
And every speech / of rybaudry and vice
Also in courts / of mercy found is naught
And of relygyon / no sele if it were sought
Envy possessyth the place of charity
Only Ambicion has there auctoryte
These vices to resyste / passyth humayne doctrine
Man they overcome / except wysdom dyuyne
If god do not socoure it passyth mannys might
With such occasyon / contynually to fight
This knew saint Martyn / by sight contynuall
Yet naught him mouyd by help celestial
And though he lived in court right holely
He would no longer ensue that chyua^ry
Nor leave example / to other men to come
To live / where reygneth no virtue nor wisdom
As when it was asked of Christ our savior
What should a man do / of penance or labor
Or other dedys to win eternal blys
He bed not a man / ren to the court ywys
He said not go follow a prince or lord or king
But go fell thy riches / and other worldly thing
Despise all the world / and worldly vanyte
For so have I done / than come and follow me
In this cause / our lord has made no mencyon
Of following the court / for vain promocyon
Than let men take heed / though they be virtuous
Lest while they follow a thing so perylous
In court supposing / their sowles for to win
Lest there they lose them / by falling into syn
For there be snarys and gy^ys infynyte
The fend is ready / occasyon to excyte
In every corner some envy shall thou mete
And stomblynge stonys lay hyd before thy fete
Full hard is it there / Ambicyon to refayne
Auaryce to slake / it is a great pain
To tame envy / and wrath to mitigate
And in occasyon onclenlynes to hate
Hard is it daily to be among these same
And none of them all / thy pleasour to inflame
But if there be any / which can his lust subdue
Among all wyces / to kept them in virtue
As a precious stone / clean in the mids of mire
Or lie in flamys / not greuyd with the fire
Or touch soft pytche and not his fyngers fyle
If such one be found / within a thousand mile
I will not deny / but that he may well sue
After court / and follow / not hurtynge his virtue
So much more merit / shall such a man procure
How much more he does / of ieopardy endure
But this is my mind / and sure opinion
That such as resort / unto the court echone
Be rather overcome / by syn and visyousnes
Than they can vices vaynquysshe and repres
For man of his nature / is apt to syn and vice
And with great hardness does virtue exercise
Example of children / which if they have their will
Be less dysposed to goodness / than to ill
I hard Minalcas sing / this unto his drone
That scripture says / that mankind is not prone
In youth and age / his pleasour to ensure
In easy lusts / than hardness of virtue
Therefore I council / thyselfe my Coridon
Amyntas / Codrus / and shepherdes echone
And all of other men which will them save fro hell
That none of them all / presume with court to mell
For there is the soul in ieopardy by crime
And after life is lost be surffet or due time
For other must a man unto his prince assent
Laughe at his vices and be with them content
Than lost is thy soul / else his fawtys blame
Than shall thou his Ire against the inflame
As Cirus the king sometime of persy land
Had one Arpolus / chief friend of a thousand
Because Arpolus onys blamyd his offense
The wrathful tyran / by mad malyuolence
Caused Arpolus / unwarily at a feste
To ete his Children as they like meat were dressed
And thus Ar polus to his children was a grave
For blamige thy prince such reward may ^ have
Right so Cambyses / in hasty furour slew
The sone of his friend which was to him most true
By cause that his friend / him blamyd for dronknes
Of such examples / be many mo doutles

Coridon. I have hard Codrus often times testefy
How Aristotle / prince of philosophy
Sued the tentys / with lawdes and honor
Of Alexander the mighty conqueror

Cornix. Thou little know what caused him do so
Or if he freely had lyberte to go
Truly I suppose / it was against his heart
And that he might not at lyberte depart
But many other right worthy hye honor
Also insured / that mighty conqueror
As Calystynes of hye dyscressyon
And also Crito / which was his norsys son
And bold Lichunachus / folowyd him in fight
Which was a philosopher / and eke a worthy knight
And many mo else that I can count or tell
But here Coridon what unto these befell
For that Calistines forbad men to honor
Great Alexander as god of most valor
After such costome as was in Persy land
Therefore had he cut / from body / foot and hand
His nose and earys / of trenchyd were also
His iyen out dygged for to increas his woe
Than by commandment of the conqueror
Was thrust into prison to bide in more dolor
Endurynge his life / there ever to remain
But wha^ Lisimachus for to make short this pain
Rechyd him poysen / his cruel conqueror
Made him be thrown to lions to devour
And at a banquet / as erst was towchyd plain
By Alexander was the said Crito slain
For blaming of him by cause that he did blame
His father deeds / Philipphus by his name
Therefore Coridon after my judgment
And as I believe thou wylt thereto assent
They all be folys / which sue to court so sore
For all such causys / as towched ar before
Or to win sowles / be there content to serve
Their own soul puttinge in danger for to sterue
For other do they seek and hunt about in vain
And their desires there shall they not obtain
Or yt thing they seek / which shall do them damage
Else be they thrown in such a blind dotage
That of two waynes / they chose most Jeopardous
All full of thorns / and besynes perylous
All if they might well to their desire attain
By way more easy / more short and void of pain

Coridon. O marvelous matter and well brought to an end
I can not be able thy reason to commend
Nor yet to reward the thing that thou haste done
Though I had riches / and wit like Salamon
Thou haste me sauyd / by council sapient
Out of hell mouth / and any fold tourment
But now is it time / to draw to our cotage
The day is endyth / right so is our langage

Finis.
This endyth the second egloge of the miserye of courtys and courters.
Here begins the third and last egloge of the misery and behauour of
courtys and courters
Coridon. AFter sore labor / sweet rest is delectable
And after long night day light is comfortable
And many words requires much drink
The throat well wasshyd tha^ love y^ iyen to wynke
This night with me / it prouyd other wise
I drank to bedwarde / as is my common gyse
But such rest / had I till it was on the morn
As had my mother / the night that I was borne

Cornix. Of that I mayuayle / for thou art wont always
To sleap and to snort / till time that it be day
But how hapenyd this / now tell me Coridon
That thou had this night so sore vexacion

Coridon. I was so drenchyd with dreamys a drad so sore
I trow never man was troubled so before
Me thought in the court I taken was in trap
And there sore handled / god give it an ill hap
Me thought the scolyons / like fendes of there lokes
Came some with whytles / some other with flesh hokes
Me thought that they stood echone about me thycke
With knyues ready for to flea me quick
So had I slepynge as much of fear and dread
As I should waking / have lost my skyn in deed
With such a vision / I troubled was all night
Wherefore I ioyed / what time I saw day light
For as soon as ever I hard the birds pepe
For fear of dreamys / no longer durst I sleep
But stert fro my bid / as lightly was I pressed
Almost as a bird / out flees from her nest
So cawght I my male / my boteiland my hoke
And forth with my flock / anon my way I took
But tell me Cornix / I pray the heartily
What thing this my dream / may note and signify

Cornix. I dread list some one / fulfyllyd / with ill will
Had hard our talking / and it reportyd ill
Which may us after cause rather weep than sing
For ill will makyth / the worst of every thing
But than does one thing / well confort me again
Forced men ar wont / of that to dream certain
Wherewith their minds / in walking trowbled be
A straw for dreamys / they be but vanyte
And as for me / I no man dyscommende
If scabbyd clawe / the troth shall me defend
But how Coridon / thy head is in thy lap
What now so erly begynnest thou to nap

Coridon. Who has not slept / nor restydall the night
Must sleap by day / else shall his brain be light
But Cornix if thou list / me for to keep and wake
Talk of some mattes again for gods sake
For so shall the time ouerpasse with little pain
God knowyth when we shall mete after again

Cornix. I grant Coridon / for recreacyon
Of court yet to have / more co^municacyon

Coridon. All mysery of court / thou have all ready told


Cornix. Nay nay Coridon / not by a thousand fold
We shall have matter / nere till this years end
To talk of courts / if I might it intend
But this one day of part well may we talk
As for the other I force not let it walk

Coridon. Tha^syth down Cornix / lean here again this ba^ke
As for our talking we get but little thank

Cornix. We get as much almost as we deserve
I look for no thank nor mete though I should steruae
In court shall men find yet many pains mo
Some shall I touch / let all the other go
Because that of slepynge was our first co^monynge
Here now what pains have courters in slepynge
They oftentyme sleep / full wretchedly in pain
And lay all the night / forth in cold wynd and rain
Sometime in bare straw / on bordes ground or stonys
Till both their sides ache and all their bonys
And when that one side aketh and is weary
Than turn the other / lo here a remedy
Or else must he rise and walk himself a space
Till time his joints be satled in their place
But if it fortune thou lie within some town
In bed of feathers / or else of easy down
Than make the ready / for flies and for gnattys
For lyse for fleas / punaysys myse and rattys
These shall with bytynge / with stynkynge din and sou^de
Make ye wors easment / than if thou lay on grau^de
And never in the court shall thou have bed alone
Save when thou would most gladly lie with one
Thy shetys shall be onclene / ragged and rent
Lothly unto sight / but lothlyer to sent
In which some other / departed late before
Of the pestylence / or of some other sore
Such a bedfelawe men shall to the assygne
That it were better to sleep among the swyne
So foul and scabyd of hard pymples so thyn
That a man might grate hard erustes on his skyn
And all the night long shall he his sydys grate
Better lay on ground / than lay with such a mate
One coughyth so fast / another breath does stynke
That during y^ night / scant may y^ get a wynke
Sometime a ^eper / is sygned to thy bed
Or with other sore / one grievously bested
Sometime thy bedfelawe is colder than is yse
To him than he drawith / thy clothys with a tryse
But if he be hot / by fevers than shall he
Cast all the clothys / and couerlet on the
Other is thy felawe always to the grievous
Or else thou to him art always tedyous
And sometime these courters / them more to incomber
Sleep all in one chamber / nere twenty in number
Than it is great sorrow / for to abide their showt
Some fert some flyngyth / and other snort and rowt
Some book and some babble / some comyth drunk to bed
Some brawle and so Jangel wha^ they be beestly fed
Some laughe and some cry / each man will have his will
Some spue and some pysse / not one of them is still
Never be they still till mids of the night
And than some brawlyth and for their beds fight
And often art thou sygned to loge nere the stable
Than there shall thou here of rascoides a rabble
Sometime shall thon here / how they each other smite
The nyenge of horses / and how each other byte
Never shall thou know thy lodging or thy nest
Till all thy betters / be sadled and at rest
In ynnes be strangers / and gestys many one
Of courters lives / make there conclusyon
And where they be knouen of neither man nor wife
Often times courters / there end their wretchyd life
Than shall the hosteler be their executour
Or such other rybaude shall / that was his devour
Making the tapster / comyth gay and feat
His shert / his doublet or bonet to excheat
For flesh that he bought and paid naught therefore
Than is she extreme / for he shall come no more
But a common in / if that thou lodge or lie
Thou never can lay up / thy gere so pryuely
But other it is stolen / or chaungyd with a thought
And for a good / thou have a thing of naught
For some arcant theuys / shall in thy chamber lie
And while thou slepyst / they rise shall pryuely
All if thou thy powche under thy pylowe lay
Some one crafty sercher / thereat shall have assay
Baudes and brethels / and flaterynge tapstres
Joglers and pypers and scorfy waferers
Flaterers and hostlers / and other of this sect
Ar besy in thy chamber / chattynge with none effect
With brawling they enter first padyant of thy play
That naught may y^ here what wyser men do say
Such is their showtynge yt scantly may thou here
The secret follow / which by thy side is nere
But rural flymmers / and other of our sort
Unto thy lodging / or court when they resort
They chat they babyll / and all / but of the womb
More pert and more peuisshe tha^ they would be at home
Though thou would sleep in during all the night
Some sing / some morn / their ^e^man out of sight
Some sing of Bessy / and some of Nane or kate
Namely when lycour dystourbed has the pate
The brotell boteman / and wretchyd laborer
Cesse not to sing / be vytayle never so dear
Who can with such have quietness or rest
But if thou with sleep / at last be oppressed
And that sore labors / to sleep the constrayne
Rumor the raysyth and wakenyd again
On morning when thou might sleep most quietly
Than must thou arise there is no remedy
For what time thy lord unto his horse is pressed
Than ought no servant / lie in his bed at rest

Coridon. Now Cornix I se that with a brawling wife
Better were to bide / contynuynge my life
And to here children cryenge on every side
Than thus in the court this / clamor to abide

Cornix. No dout Coridon / but here more mysery
Which in their lodging / have courters commonly
Men must win the marshall / or else herbegere
With price or with prayer else must thou stand arere
And reward their knauys / must thou if thon be able
For to assygne the / a lodging tolerable
And though they promise yet shall they naught fulfill
But point the place / nothing after thy will
Other nere a preuey / a stable or asynke
For sent and for clamor where y^ can have no wynke
After thy reward they shall the so manace
That malgre thy tethe thou must resign thy place
And that to some one which is thy ennemy
^f they be pleased there is no remedy
But yet for certain / it were thing tolerable
To beck and to bow / to personys honorable
As to the marshall / or yet the herbeger
Or gentle personys / which unto them be ne^e
But this is a work / a trouble and great pain
Sometime must thou stoop / unto a rude vyllayne
Calling him master / and often clawe his hand.
All if thou would se him wawer in a band
For if thou live in court / y^ must reward this rabble
Cokes and scolyons / and fermers of the stable
Butlers and butchers / prouenders and bakers
Porters and powlers / and specially false takers
On these and all like / spare must thou none expense
But mekely with mede / bye there benevolence
But namely of all / it is a grievous pain
To abide the porter / if he be a vyllayne
How oftentimes shall he the yatys close
Against thy stomach / thy forhede or thy nose
How oftentimes / when thy one foot is in
Shall he by malice / out thrust the be thy chyn
Sometime his fader / sometime his clubbysshe fete
Shall drive ye backewarde / and turn y^ to the street
What he the says / coming if he sit
How oftentimes shall he the yatys shyt
For very pleasour and joy of thy coming
The yatys he closyth / lo here a pleasant thing
All if thou have / well rewarded him before
Without thou stand / in rain and tempest sore
And in the mean time / a rascolde or vylayne
Shall never while thou art bathyd in the rain
Sometime the porter his malice shall excuse
And say unto the / thy labor to abuse
That other is the lord / a sleep or in council
Than lost is thy labor / mysspent is thy trauayll

Coridon. Of our pore howses / men soon may konwe the gyn
So at our pleasour / we may go out and in
If courtys be such / me thinks without dout
They best be at eas which so remain without
For better be without / wete to the skyn with rain
Than ever in court and live in endless pain
For if hell yatys / did not still open gape
Tha^ wretchyd sowles / great tourme^t should escape
Right so / if the court were close contynually
Some men should escape great pain and mysery
But Cornix proceed / tell on of courters care

Cornix. Well said Coridon / god give the well to far
Now would I speak of pains of the ware
But that me thynkyth is best for to dyffarre
For if thy lord in battle have delight
To sue the war / be paynys infynyte
For while he warryth / thou may not abide at home
Thy lust to cherysshe / and pleasour of thy womb
To sue an army / than have thou wretchyd pain
Of cold or of heat / of thrust hunger and rain
And mo other pains than I will specyfy
For naught is in warrefare / save care and mysery
Murder and myschefe / rapyns and cowardyse
Or else cruelte / there reygneth naught but vice
Which here to recounte / were long and tedyous
And to our purpose in part contraryous
Therefore let pas / the warrys mysery
The dredefull dangers / and wretchyd penury
And of these Cytees / talk we a word or twain
In which no man can live avoid of pain
For whether so ever the court remove or flyet
All the vexacyons / remove always with it
If thou for solace into the town resort
There shall thou mete / of men as bad a sort
With at thy clothing / and the shall have dysdayne
If thou be besy / the club shall do the pain
There be now customs / and actys in like wise
None may thou scorn / nor none of them despise
Than must thou each day begin to live on new
As for in Cytees I will no more remain
But turn my talking / now to the court again
After of this may we / have co^munycacyon
Of Cytezyns / and of their vexacyon
Whether that thy lord sit / or yet stand erect
Still may thou stand / or else shall thou be cheet
Thy head and legs shall find no rest nor eas
If thou in court intend always to pleas
Often must thou beck / still stand and ever bare
To wors than thy self / which is a pain and care
What shall I common / the pensyfnes and pain
Of courters / or they / their wagys can obtain
How much dyfferrynge / and how much abatynge
Must courters suffer / and manyfolde checkynge
Never have thou the hole sometime shall they abate
Or else shall the day / or payment be to late
From Robert to John^ / sometime they shall the send
And than none of both / to pay the / may eutende
From post unto pyller / tossyd shall thou be
Scorned and blinded / with frawde and subtylte
Some may thou behold / sighynge for great sorrow
When he is appointed to come again to morrow
For many a morrow has he ben served so
Another standyth his heart replete with woe
Countyng and tournynge his gotys in his cap
Praynge god to send the payer an evil hap
For where he rekened / for to receive a pound
Skant has he half / such checkes be there found
Never shall the courter receive hole salary
Except that he reward / the payer pryuely
When need constraynyth somewhat to have before
He gladly receives / a doseyn for a score
Never can thou make / thy covenant so clear
But that the payer shall bring the far atere
All if thou right well / thy covenant fulfill
It shall the payer / interpret at his will
For all that blind sort / ar chokyd with anaryse
As cratchers of coin / ensewynge couetyse
But somewhat to speak / of things necessary
These do all courters / cares multyply
Now for one thing they labor to obtain
Now for another / and often all in vain
And though their asking be neither right ne just
Yet never stynt they / till they have had their lust
But if it fortune / their prayer and their cost
Be spent all in vain / than is their reason lost
Than lurk they in corners for a month or twain
For woe that their labor and prayer was in vane
Some with their princes / so stands in favor
That they may auance their kynred to honor
But than is thryr kynred so bad of governance
That all if they may / they dare not them auance
But how be it they durst / they dread of worldly shame
Or punyishme^t of god / or else their princes bla^^

Coridon. Now doutles Cornix / that man is much onwyse
Which lyftyth folys unworthy to office
But often time favor and carnal affection
A busyth the right / blyndynge dyscressyon

Cornix. If thou had musyd a year for this on clause
Thou could not a said / more profytely the cause
Beside this / Coridon few by the lord above
Have of these courters / true sure and perfyte love
For Codrus told me / what wrytyth ysocrate
That all these princes and every great estate
In loving regard / no virtue nor prudence
None love they / but of some hasty violence
Without auysement / without dyscrecyon
Such love often prouyth faint at conclusyon
But if they love any they love him not as frynde
Between like and like / best frendshyp shall we find
For truly great lords / love such men with delight
By them when they take some pleasour or profit
As they love horsys / dogs and mo such
What said I. I lie / they love them not so much
More love they a horse or dog than a man
Ask of Minalcas the truth declare he can
For commonly as soon as any man is dead
Another is sone ready / for to fulfill his stead
With mede and with prayer / his place is derely bought
So often have princes their service clear for naught
But than if it fortune / a dog or horse to dye
His place to fulfill / another must they bye
Yet little have I said / wors in the court they fare
Not only thy lord shall for thy death naught care
For thy long service / often shall he wysshe the deed
Such is in court / thy salayre and thy mede
Other for thy service / long and contynuall
Thou have of thy lord / receive naught at all
And when thou art dead with short conclusyon
Than quite is thy service / and oblygacyon
And often shall thy lord sound swetely forth this A
A that this man / so sone is gone away
If he had lived longer / a small season
I should have put him to great promocyon
Or else if thy lord has well rewardyd the
That thou have lyuelod / and riches in plente
Than if thou dye / believe me for certain
Suerly trustyth / for to have all again
Scant any rich man by death hence now shall fare
But that some great lord will look to be his heir

Coridon. That is no leasing / but prouyd often true
That caused wydows / oftymes sore to rewe
But this has been seen / for sothe and ever shall
That the greater fysshe deuoureth up the small

Cornix. A right true example / mate Coridon doutles
So mighty rulers / the simple folk oppres
But what care in court is / now here my Coridon
Concerning thy lord / or masters own parson
Of princes or commons thou fyndest seldom time
One profytely good and spottyd with no crime
For all such things as seldom time befall
Tully was wont the monstres for to call
Than is a good man / more monster in deed
Than is a wether having a dowble head
And in like wise / reheriyth Fuuenall
That if a man would seek over the world all
So many good man vnetys find should he
As there be yates / in Thebes the Cite
That is to say under the cop of heaven
Of parfyte good men / scant shall a man find seven
And holy scripture / yet speaks more straytly
As shepherd David / does clerly testefy
He said our lord beholdynge on mankind
Could skant one good / in all the world find
Scripture records / such causes many one
That men be sinners / and god in good alone

Coridon. When now mate Cornix / Aygh man god auowe
Thou have in some frerys bosom been I trow
And spoiled some patche of his prechement
Talk of the court / save this in store for lent

Cornix. So was my purpos thou nedyst naught object
Of our first purpos these words have effect
I told the before / by good auctoryte
How both the poetis / and orators agree
And holy scripture / that few men be parfyte
But bad in number / be truly infenyte
So if thy master be bad and worthy blame
Than art thou sorry / of his dyshonest name
Thy lordys vices / and living neglygent
Shall grieve thy stomach if thou be innocent
It greuyth the / if he be covetous or hard
Because he daynyth / thy labor to reward
And for many things / fail by his negligence
And fall to ruin for sparynge of expense
Again if thy lord / be fre and lyberall
Always thou fyryst lest other men have all
His prodygall hand / often vexith sore thy heart
Lest at the ending / naught shall come to thy part
And lest his treasour / in folly so he spend
That no thing remain to help him at the end
But if he be given / to wrath and cruelte
Thou fear lest he rage / again thy kyn or the
If he be meke mylde and sober / thou art sorry
For he not reuengyth / each hurt and injury
And if he be hard / than dredest thou danger
When he procedyth than stand thou arere
If he be coward / than have thou great envy
Again his foes / for they contynually
Dystroy his londys and sore his name dystayne
When he for dread / dare no thing do again
If he use chattynge and oftyn be talking
Well thou perceyuest y^ while his tongue is walkyng
His pryue council / he oftyn does detect
And much he spekyth / which is of none effect
If he be secret and still as one in sleep
Thou say he douteth / that none can council keep
And the suspectyth as much as other mo
Than art thou greuyd and full of care and woe
If he love wynes and thou fear dronkenes
If he hate wynes and thou blamest his sadness
And to his body thou countest him nygarde
By cause he would keep his how should y^ more hard
To venus actis / if he to much aply
Thou say he to many does hurt and injury
If he hate wymen / and fle their pleasour than
Both thou and other reputest him no man
With few men / if he use famylyaryte
Thou art dyspleasyd of them if thou not be
If he be common / to all indyfferent
Than is thy mind in like wise dyscontent
By cause he loves famylyer to be
To every person / as greatly as with the
But if that thy prince be good and thou be naught
Tha^ art thou inlyke wise sore verid in thy thought
Lest that he shortly / thy service may despise
By cause he not lyuyth / after thy lewd gyse
But if both be good and of all vices clean
Which is a thing that seldom time is seen
Than monest thou / for that he is not fortunate
As he is ordained / and after his estate
Thy heart and mind all thou to him inclyne
That all his troubles and pain shall be thine
For this without dout / I tell the Coridon
That no father is so tender over his son
As is a good servant / dylygent and true
Unto a noble prince endewed with virtue
And all if good fortune to him be favorable
Yet still thou dredest / bycawse it is unstable
Thus never shall thou sleep in peace and quietness
But when thou wakest thy rest is much les

Coridon. By cause thou recountest / of thy fydelyte
Of masters and men / which loves honest
Now I remember the shepherde of the fen
And what care for him demeanyd all his men
And shepherd Morton / when he durst not apere
How his old seruantys were careful of their there
In pain and pleasour / they kept fydelyte
Till grace again / have him auctoryte
Than his old favor / did them again restore
To greatter pleasour / than they had pain before
Though or a season / this shepherde bode a blast
The greattyst w^udes / yet slakyth at the last
And at conclusyon / he and his flock certain
Each true to other / did quyetly remain
My heart sore mouineth / when I must specyfy
Of the gentle Coke / which sange so merely
He and his flock / were like an union
Conjoined in one without dyscencyon
All the fair Cokes / which in his days crewe
When death him touched / did his departing rewe
The pretty palace / be him made in the fen
The maids wydowes / the wives and the men
With dedely dolor / were persyd to the heart
When death constrained / this shepherde to depart
Corn / grass and feldes / mournyd for woe and pain
For of this prayer / for them obtained rain
The plyasant flowers / for woe fadyd echone
When they perceived this shepherde ded and gone
The okys elmys / and every sort of dear
Shronke under shadow / abatynge all their chere
The mighty wallys of Ely monastary
The stonys / rocks and towers semblably
The marbyll pyllers and images echone
Swet al for sorrow wha^ this good cock was gone
Though he of stature / were humble wenke and lean
His mind was hye / his living pure and clean
Where other fedyth / by beesty appetyte
On heavenly fode was all his hole delight
And shortly after this Cock was deed and gone
The shepherde Roger / could not bide long alone
But shortly after / falls death stole him away
His worthy report yet lives till this day
Wha^ sheep ware scabbyd this good shepherd was feign
With easy saluys their sore to cure again
He naught pretended / nor showed of rygour
Nor was no wolf / pore lambs to devour
When busshe or bramblys pellyd the shepys skayn
Than had he pity / and kept them close within
Or in new flecys / did tenderly them lap
And with his scyrtys did oftentyme them hap
When he departed / his flock for woe was faint
The foldes sounded / with dolor and complaynt
So that their clamor and cry bespred the isle
His deed was mourned from Ely forty mile
These worthy herdys and many other mo
Were with their wethers / in lone conjoined so
That more they curyd by wit and pacyence
Than dreadful Drome can do with violence
Therefore all herdes / unto the would I trow
Should lawd their names if wertue reigned now
But sith that conynge / and virtue nere be gone
Now be they law did forsothe of few or none
I let thy purpos to make conclusyon
Uyce lives / virtue has light oblyuyon
But speak on Cornix / yet is it long to night
My mind to dysclose / causes my heart to be light

Cornix. To lawde these pastors / wherefore haste thou delight


Coridon. All other shepherdys / to virtue to excyte


Eornix. Than be thy wordys / no think mysspent in vain
But now to courtys will I return again
And namely for thou / have spokyn of konnyge
Me list a little to common of that thing
It is to clerks great pleasour certainly
And recreacyon / to give them to study
And some find pleasour and recreacyon
In secret study / and meditacyon
To write or to read in placys solytary
Hole to the musis / his reason to apply
To talk with Plato / with Tully or Uirgill
With Aristotle / to common at his will
And other famous / doctors many one

Coridon. What man all these long past / be deed and gone
Who would with such deput common or talk
To go where they be / shall find a weary walk

Cornix. Though they be deed / alive yet is their name
These lawdes honor / their hye report of fame
So men deuyseth / to speak with them in deed
As often as they their noble works read
But as for courters / as well erly as late
Be of this pleasour / plain utterly pryuate
Though they live idle / their pains infenyte
To godly warkes / them grants no respyte
Always in clamor remain they / and in preas
And lewd aquayntance / will them no time releas
But if that they chose some season secretly
To some good stody / their myndesto aply
To write or to read / anon some wretch is feign
And glad them to vex and to dystorbe again
But if all other / be absent and at rest
Than never their chamber the kychyn clerk is pressed
Jenglynge his counters chattynge himself alone
Thus seek all corners / quiet thou fyndest none
So must on despise / those noble orators
The famous poetys and excellent doctors
And live among the avoid of virtues all
That rather a man rude beestys may them call
Of great estatys / there is a blinded sort
Which cause their sonys unto the court resort
That they may in court themself daily frequent
In learning virtue and manners excellent
But better might they say to learn all malice
All cursed manners and every branch of vice
As Pride dysdayne envy and rybawdry
So be good manners infect with vyllayne
For surely in courts be men most vicyous
Supporting vices / to virtue contraryous
Dyshonest langage is countyd most lawdable
One bosteth baudry / or glotony damnable
No man there / vauntyth himself of honest
Of virtue manners of mercy nor Pity
But other he ioyeth of his myscheuous life
To have defiled / a virgin or a wife
Or else to have slain / his fo or ennemy
Or fraud committed or crafty felony
Which cursyd manners / youth sooner does ensue
Than godly living or manners of virtue
When youth in vices has fyxed their cowrage
They by no meanys / shall leave the same in age
Nor thyncke not in court / to find a young strypelynge
Chaste / sober / shamfast or manners ensuynge
All sueth vices / all sue enormyte
Such be the discyples / as their infourmers be
For true is the clawse / rehersyd of Therence
That youth inclyned / than namely to offense
When a lewd master / him moved to inclyne
By ill example to danger and ruin
For nature leuyth / to all enormyte
When men so uses which be in dignyte
Youth thinks lawful and but a ioconde fyt
Such vice as elders use daily to commit
And as young branches / sone rote and putryfy
So youth corrupts by vices semblably

Coridon. Be all young galandes / of these abusyd sort
Which in young age / unto the court resort

Cornix. Who entryth the court / in young and tender age
Are lightly blinded with folly and outrage
But such as entryth of wit and grauyte
Bow not so soon / to such enormyte
But or they enter if they have lernyd naught
Afterward is co^nyng y^ lest part of their thought
In court it is countyd / vice to have science
And countyd for rebuke / for to have eloquence
Thus have men conning great heaviness and pain
Beholdynge themself in court had in dysdayne
Their wit despised / In mean time shall they se
That greatest matters ruled / Nay / marred be
Of such blind folys / as can not count nor tell
A score save twenty / yet most of all such mell
But men vnlernyd of inward pain have some
When they behold that to the court be come
Men groundly lernyd / in latyne / co^monynge
The other harken and understand no thing
Than truly it is / to them a grievous pain
But nevertheless / of them have they dysdayne
But living in court / and fleing none offense
What shall I common what grutche of conscience
Uexeth the daily right / small is thy delight
When troubled conscience / vnquieth does the bide
No pain is sorer / nor greuouser tourment
Than to remember / and call to thyn intent
How many vy^ys / how great enormyte
Has the in thraldom / and in captyuyte
Thine own conscience / is still within thy breast
As tourmentour / depryuynge the of rest
With pryuey scourges / and pain intolerable
Recountynge thy warkes and like abominable
Thou may not avoid / ne form this enmy sterte
Fle where the lyketh / he restyth in thy heart
This is of courters / the dedely tourmentour
With desperacyon / them seeking to devour
Sometime their conscience grutchyd is with gyle
With theft / with murder / with lechery some while
Though their own conscience thus tourme^t the^ with pain
To the same offenses return they yet again
Their conscience grutchyng to cawse of grutche they fall
Thus still them tourment / the furyes infernal
I mean remenbraunce of many fold offense
Contynuall tourment / by grutche of conscience
What shall I tell the pain of sodeynce fear
Which does the minds of courters often dear
Sometime the lower be greuyd with thretnynge
And suffer pains / when they have done no thing
Sometime while the court is daunsynge in dysport
Or in other solace / their hartys to confort
A none comes in / a soden messagere
Aff^rmynge truly / some armyd foes nere
And that same armey is nere at hand doutles
Than tourneth solace to woe and heaviness
And while some princes / for pleasour hawke or hunt
Such ferfull tidings to here often are thy wont

Coridon. Such fere and danger does happyn commonly
On all degres with sudden ieopardy
For plowmen / shepherdes and Cytezyns also
Be war endures / great damage / loss and woe

Cornix. All other sorts sometime must stand a far
But courts must by de all danger of the war
Save loss of goods / for some have naught to lose
But this will I leave and turn to my purpose
No gifts is granted / of god unto mankind
Better than frendshyp wha^ man it true may find
But over all the court no man shall find nor se
True / steadfast / frendshyp / nor parfyte amyte
For sith all courters for most part blinded be
With vicyous living and all enormyte
They have no frendshyp / but conspyracyon
And to do myschefe / confederacyon
For parfyte frendshyp is when two men agree
Or mo in workynge some deed of honest
Some courters be found which some ingenyous
Pregnant of reason wise and laboryous
Yet have they but shadow of virtue and goodness
And not of virtues the plain signs expres
Some seem lyberall / but they ensue rapyne
Some seem very chaste / but they to pride inclyne
Some seems humble / which uses glotony
And some famylyer / which lean to lechery
In none may thou se one sparcle of virtue
But twenty vices / shall that one gyfe ensue
In such a meany / full of inequyte
Hard is to find one worthy amyte
But if thou in court / some honest men awayte
Than with great rulers / is he made in conceyt
If he from conceyt / and out of favor be
Thou may not with him have famylyaryte
Sometime shall thou se such drawn to tourment
As be thy friends / fawtles and innocent
And often thy enmy / in many a faut culpable
Thou shall in the court se hye and honorable
To se thy good friend / bide death so wrongfully
To sorrow and naught say / is a great pain truly
But yet for thy life / say naught be pacyent
Not only whysper / lest thou have like tourment
Conversant must thou be / with such to thy pain
Which has thy fader / or else thy brother slain
If thou be besy / or squarynge of langage
Thou may parauenture walk on y^ same passage
And if thou in court to riches so assende
That thou may reteyne / men on the to attend
Some of thy seruauntys shall thou often time behold
Lewdly dysposyd / to vices many fold
Some shall be the uys / some dronkener then swyne
Some shall love brawling / or to lyenge inclyne
Some slow / some glotons / some fall to rybaudry
Auoutry murder with other vyllayny
Some be forgetful / some ^eart / some insolent
Some craftles foolys / some porwd and neglygent
If thou change supposing / some better for to have
Thou voydest a lubber and have again a knave
And if thou have one with knauysshnes infect
Than all the other shall follow the same sect
Again if thy self / be pore and a servant
Thou shall find thy master rude rassh and ignorant
Always complaining / and never well content
Often asking service in paynge neglygent
Of spech superflue / hasty and rygorous
Enuyous / dronken / unstable / and covetous
Thus servant / master / gentylman / and vyllayne
Live all in court / with mysery and pain

Coridon. Now truly Cornix / this is a wretchyd life
Uoyde of all plesour / wrappyd in pain and strife

Cornix. Count all the rowmes / and offices echone
And none shall thu find / without vexacyon
What think the council / when pryncys not agree
To their aduysement / of most vtylyte
What have chauncelers / of inward dyspleasour
Wha^ their letters wrytyn to their princes honor
For the common well and sure vtylyte
Can not pass forward / till they transposed be
From good to right naught corrupt for correct
What think controwlers wha^ they be daily chekt
The rulers of court / vlsher and senescall
Tresorers / clerks / and every marshall
What pain have these / echone in his office
When often rybaw^es / them sclander and despyce
Or some besy body / having but small in^yght
Control their countes / be the never so right
What pain have chapleyns / controlled in ^e^uyce
And Ppysicians / when some their art despise
What knights / trumpetters / and sodyours commonly
When tresores / their wages does deny
What pain have cokys which ska^t may seth there befe
Without some rebuke / a check or a reprefe
Coridon in court / no rowm is trust thou me
But that is wrappyd / in great aduersyte
But brefe to say all / and make conclusyon
Right wysmen suffers great trybulacyon
The heuynly pleasour / to purchase and obtain
More suffceth courters to purchase endless pain
I mell not with them / which of necessyte
Again their pleasour / must in the courtys be
As besy ^uters to purchase droyt and right
Which would be thence / right gladly if they might

Coridon. Believe my Cornix / thou turned have my mind
Farewell all courtynge / adieu pleasour onkynde
Thou plain have prouyd / that all they foolys be
Which follow the court / seeking captruyte
And might else where / an honest life purchase
Having suffy sance and moderate solace

Cornix. Than let all shepherdes / from hens to Salysbery
With easy riches live well / laughe and be merry
Pype under shadows / small riches has most rest
In greatest sees most sorest is tempest
The court is naught else / but a tempestous se
Avoid the rocks be ruled after me
There is more danger / than is upon the land
As swalows / rocks / tempest and quick land
^ere maids singing / abusing with their song
Caribdis / Sylla / and sandy banks long
In it be clyffes / of hardest Adamant
To syn excytynge young folys ignorant
What shepherde loves peace and tranquilyte
Or rest requires to live in unity
Sweet peace of heart / who ever does require
Or health of his soul / if any man desire
Fle from the court / fle from the court I cry
Fle proud beggary / and lolem mysery
For there is no rest / nor godly exercise
No love of virtue / but use of every vice
As auatyce / lust / and beestly glotony
Cruelte / malice / ambicyon / and envy
But namely Uenus / or lust venerall
To her vile actys / plainly subdueth all
Upon which vices / who fyxeth his intent
Himself to defend / has he no argument
But that of all men wise / honest and laudable
He shall be conuyct of living reprouable
A natural fool / of reason dull and rude
Proface Coridon / thus do I here conclude

Coridon. Conclude mote thy life in blessed state of grace
Mine own heart Coruix / for this thy good solace
But have thou touched / all hole and parfytly
Of court and courters / the pain and mysery

Cornix. Nay nay Coridon / I told the so before
Much have I told behind is much more
Their inward crymys / and vice abhomynable
Their outward ragynge in sins detestable
Their theft and faudes / and their extorcyon
And of myslyuers their supportacyon
Their daily murder / and forsynge of women
Fraudynge of virgins / pyllynge of simple men
Auoutry incest / and fornycacyon
And of good virgins / the defloracyon
These and such like darc I not plainly towche
For all these crosses and silver in my powche

Coridon. Than haste we hence / the son is nere at rest


Cornix. Take up thy baggage my mate / that now is best


Coridon. But tell me Cornix one thing or we depart
On what manner life is best to set my heart
In court is combrance / care / pain and mysery
And here is envy / ill will and penury

Cornix. Suffrance overcomes all malice at the last
Weyke is that tree / which can not abide a blast
But here now my council I bide the finally
Live still a shepherde for plainly so will I

Coridon. That I shall Cornix / thy good council fulfill
To dye a shepherde / establyd is my will

Cornix. So do / or after thou often shall repent
Pore lyse is surest / the court is but tourment

Coridon. ^ diew sweet Cornir / departing is a pain
But myrthe renews / when lovers mete again.

Finis.
Thus ends the third and last egloge of the mysery of court and courters /
Composed by Alexander Barclay priest in his youth.
The book of Codrus and Mynalcas.


The prologe of the fourth Eglog of Alexander Barcley.
COdrus a shepherde / lusty gaye and stout
Sat with his wethers / at pasture round about
And poor Mynalcas / with ewes scarce fourtene
Sat sadly musyng / in shadow on the grene
This lusty Codrus / was cloked for the rain
And double decked / with hoodes one or twain
That this long season none could the here espy
With us was thou wont to sing full merely
And to lie pipyng often time among the flouers
What time thy bestes / were fedyng among ours
In these cold valeys / we two were wont to bourde
And in these shadows / talk many a merry word
And often were we wont / to wrastell for a fall
But now thou droupest / and have forgotten all
Here was thou wont / sweet balades to sing
Of song and dytie / as it were for a king
And of gay matters / to sing and to endyte
But now thy courage is gone / and thy delight
Trust me Mynalcas / now plainly I espy
That thou art weary / of shepherdes company
And that all pleasure / thou semest to dispyse
Lothyng our pasture / and feldes in likewise
Thou fleest solace and every merry fytte
Lesyng thy time / and sore hurtyng thy wit
In slouthe thou slombrist / as buried were thy song
Thy pype is broken / or somewhat else is wrong.
Mynalcas. What time the cock crows / feathers mout and fall
From sight she lurketh / her song is gone withal
When back is bare / and purse of coin is light
The wit is dulled / and reason has no might
A due endityng / when gone is lyberte
Envy to muses / is wretched pouerte
What time a knight / is subget to a knave
To just or tourney / small pleasure shall he have.

Codrus. What / no man the keeps / here in captiuyte
And busy labor / subdueth pouerte
And often is it better / and much surer also
As subget to obey / than at frewyll to go
As by ensample / behold a wanton colt
In ragyng youth / lepeth over hill and holt
But while he skippeth / at pleasure and at will
Oftyme does he fall / in danger for to spyll
Sometime on stubbes / his hofes sore he tears
Or falls in the mudde / both over heed and ears
Sometime all the night / abroad in hayle or rain
And often among breres / tangled by the main
And other peryls / he suffers infynite
So mengled with sorrow / is pleasure and delight
But if the same colte / be broken at the last
His sytter rules / and him refrayneth fast
The spur him pricketh / the bridell does him hold
That he can not prau^ce at pleasure where he would
The ryder him rules / and saves from dangere
By which example / Mynalcas it is clear
That frewyll is subget / to inconuenyence
Where by subgection / man voydeth great offense
For man of him self / is very frail certain
But often a ruler / his folly does refrain
But as for thy self / thou have no cause parde
To walk at pleasure / is no captiuyte.

Mynalcas. See thou not Codrus / the feldes round about
Compased with flodes / that none may in nor out
The muddy waters / nere choke me with the stynke
At every tempest / they be as black as ynke
Pouerte to me / should be no disconfort
If other spepherde / were all of the same sort
But Codrus / I clawe often where it does not ytche
To se ten beggars / and half a dosen ritche
Truly me thinks / this wrong particion
And namely sith all / ought to be after one
When I first behold / these feldes from a far
Me thought the^ pleasant / and boyde of strife or war
But with my poor flock / aprochyng nere and nere
Always my pleasure / did less and less apere
And truly Codrus / sith I came on this ground
Often under flowers / vile snakes have I found
Adders and todes / and many vile serpent
Enfect old sheep / with venym violent
And often be the young / infected of the old
That unto these few now brought is all my fold

Codrus. In some place is another venym nor serpent
And as for my self / I feel no grievous sent.

Mynalcas. It were great marueyle / wherso great ground is seen
if no small medowe / were pleasant sweet and clean
As for the Codrus / I may believe right well
That thou no savor / nor stynke of mud dust feel
For if a shepherde / has still remained long
In a foul prison / or in a stynking gong
His poores with ill air / be stopped so echone
That of the air / he feleth small sent or none
And yet the dwellers / be badder than the place
The rich and sturdy / does threten and manace
The poor and simple / and such as came but late
And who most knows / him most of all they hate
And all the burden / is on the asses back
But the strong caball / stands at the rack
And such be assigned / sometime the flock to keep
Which scante have so much / of reason as a sheep
And every shepherde / at other has envy
Scant be a couple / which loves parfitely
Ilwyll so reigns / that braulyng be thou sure
Constrained me nere / to seek a new pasture
Save only after / I hope of better rest
For small occasyon / a bird not changes nest

Codrus. Well ere thou granted / that in a small ground
Some plot of pleasure / and quiet may be found
So where of herdes / assembled is great sort
There some must be good / than to the best resort
But leave we all this / turn to our point again
Of thy old balades / some would I here full feign
For often have I had / great pleasure and delight
To here recounted / such as thou did endyte.

Mynalcas. ye other shepherdes / which have enough at home
When ye be merry / and stuffed is your womb
Which have great store / of butter / chese / and woll
your cowes vthers / of milk replete and full
Payles of sweet milk / as full as they be able
When your fat disshes / smoke hot upon yor table
Than laud ye songs / and balades magnify
If they be merry / or written craftily
ye clappe your hands / and to the making hark
And one say to other / lo here a proper warke
But when ye have said / naught give ye for o pain
Save only lauds / and plesaunt words vain
All if these lauds / may well be counted good
yet the pore shepherde / must have some other fode.

Codrus. May thou not sometime / thy fold and sheep apply
And after at leysar / to live more quyetly
Dispose thy wits / to make or to endyte
Renou^syng cures / for time while thou do write

Mynalcas. Needs must a shepherde bestow his hole labor
Inte^dyng his flocks scant may he spare one hour
In going / coming / and often them to tend
Full lightly the day / is brought unto an end
Sometime the wolves / with dogs must he chase
Sometime his foldes / must he new compace
And oftyme them change / and if he storms dout
Of his sheep cote / daube the walls round about
When they be broken / oftymes them renew
And hurtful pastures / note well and the^ eschew
Bye straw and lytter / and hay for winter cold
Often greas the scabbes / as well of young as old
For dread of thieves / often watch up all the night
Beside this labor / with all his mind and might
For his poor household for to provide vitayle
If by adventure / his wolle or lambs fail
In doing all these / no respyte does remain
But well to endyte / requires all the brain
I tell the Codrus / a style of exellence
Must have all labor / and all the dilygence
Both these two warkes / be greatnere importable
To my small power / my strength is much unable
The one to entende / scant may I bide the pain
Than is it harder / for me to do both twain
What time my wits be clear for to endyte
My daily charges / will grant me no respyte
But if I follow / endyting at my will
Each one disdayneth / my charges to fulfill
Though in these feldes / each other ought sustain
Clean lost is that law / one may require in vayue
if coin command than men count them as bound
Else fle they labor / than is my charge on ground.

Codrus. Cornix often counted / that man should fle no pain
His friends burden / to support and sustain
Feed they thy flock / while thou do write and sing
Each horse agrees / not well for every thing
Some for the charet / some for the cart or ploughe
And some for hackeneys / if they be light and toughe
Each field agrees not well for every sede
Who has most labor / is worthy of best mede.

Mynalcas. After endityng / than gladly would I drink
To reche me y^ cup / no man does care ne think
And often some foles / void of discrecyon
Me and my matters / has in derisyon
And marueyle is none / for who would sow y^ field
With costly seeds / which shall no fruits yield
Some wanton body / often laugheth me to scorn
And says Mynalcas / se how thy pyltche is torn
Thy hose and cokers / be broken at the kne
Thou can not sto^ble / for both thy shone may se
Thy berde like bristels / or like a porpos skyn
Thy clothyng shows / thy winnyng is but thyn
Such mockyng tauntes / renews often my care
And now be wodes / of fruit and leaves bare
And frosty winter / has made the feldes white
For wrath and anger / my lyppe and tongue I byte
For dolor I droupe sore vered with disdain
My womb all wastes wherefore I bide this pain
My woll and wethers / may scarsly feed my womb
And other household / which I retain at home
Lean be my lambs / that no man will them bye
And yet their dammes / they daily souke so dry
That from their vthers / no lycour can we wring
Than without repast / who can endyte or sing
It me repents / if I have any wit
As for my science I weary am of it
And of my poor life / I weary am Codrus
Sith my hard fortune / for me disposes thus
That of the stars / and plannettes echone
To poor Mynalcas / well fortunate is none
Known is the truth / if it were clearly sought
That now to this time / I still have song for naught
For youth is lusty / and of small thing has need
That time to age / men give no force nor head
Ages condycion / is greatly contrary
Which now aprocheth / right still and craftily
But what time age / does any man oppress
if he in youth / have gathered no richesse
Than passes age / in care and pouerte
For need is grievous / with old infyrmite
And age is fettred / oftyme with care and need
When strength is faded and man has naught to feed
When strength is faded / than hope of gain is gone
In youths season / to make prouisyon
The little emet / is wise and prouydent
In somer workyng / with labor dilygent
In her small cave / conueying corn and grain
Her life in winter / to norisshe and sustain
And with her small mouth / is busy it cuttyng
Lest in her cave / the same might grow or spring
So man of reason / him self reputyng sage
In youth should puruey / to live thereon in age.

Codrus. Men say that clerks / which know astronomy
Know certain stars / which long to desteny
But all their saying / is nothing veritable
yet here the matter / thought it be but a fable
They say that Mercury / does poets favor
Under Jupiter / be princes of honor
And men of richesse / of welthe or dignyte
And all such other / as have authorite
Mercury gives / to poets laureate
Goodly co^ueyaunce / speech plesaunt and ornate
Inuentyfe reason / to sing or play on harp
In goodly dytie / or balade for to carpe
This is thy lotte / what sekest thou richesse
No man has all / this thing is true doutlesse
God all disposes / as he parceyueth best
Take thou thy fortune / and hold the still in rest
Take thou thy fortune / and hold thy self content
Let us have richesse / and roumes exellent.

Mynalcas. Thou have of richesse / and goods habundaunce
And I have dyties / and songs of plesaunce
To ask my connyng / to couytous thou art
Why is not thy self / contented with thy part
Why do thou enuade / my part and portion
Thou want Codrus / wit and discrecyon.

Codrus. Not so Mynalcas / forsothe thou art to blame
Of wrong enuasyon / to give to me the name
I would no dytie / nor balade take the fro
No harp nor arms / which long to Appollo
But only Mynalcas / I sore desire and long
To give mine ears / to thy sweet sou^dyng song
It fedeth heryng and is to one pleasant
To here good reason / and balade consonant.

Mynalcas. if thou have pleasure / to here my melody
I grant the Codrus / to joy my armony
So I have pleasure / and joy of thy richesse
So gifts doubled / increases love doutlesse.

Codrus. He of my richesse / has joy which loves me
And who me hates / nothing content is he
Gnuyous wretches / by malice commonly
Take others fortune / and pleasure heuely.

Mynalcas. In likewise may thou / enjoy of our science
And of our muses / though thou be fro presence
And of our connyng / thou ioyest semblably
if ought provoke the / by malice and envy
if I feed thy ears / feed thou my mouth again
I loathe were to spend / my gifts all in vain
Meat unto the mouth / is fode and susteynance
And songs fedeth / the ears with plesaunce
I have the muses / if thou will have of mine
Than right requires / that I have part of thine
This longs to love / to norisshe charity
This fedeth pity / this does to right agree
This is the pleasure / and will of god above
Of him disposed / for to engendre love
All plesaunt gifts / one man has not parde
That one of other / should have necessite
No man of him self / is sure sufficient
This is prouisyon / of god omnipotent
That one man should need / another assystence
Whereby is joined / love and benevolence.
England has clothe / Burdeux has store of wine
Cornwayle has tynne / and Lymster wolles fine.
London has scarlot / and Bristowe plesaunt reed
Fenne land has fysshes / in other place is leed.
This is of our lord / disposed so my brother
Because all costs / should one have need of other.
So every tree / has fruit after his kind
And diverse natures / in beestes may we find.
Always when nature / of thing is most laudable
That thing men cou^teth / most good and profitable
And every person / in his own gift has joy
The fool in his babble / has pleasure for to toye.
The clerk in his book / the merchant in richesse
The knight in his horse / harnes and hardynesse.
But every person / of his gifts and art
When need requires should gladly give some perte
Such mean conioyneth / in bond of love certain
England and France / Scotla^de Greece and Spain.
So have thou Codrus / of gold enough in store
And I some co^nyng / though few me^ care therefore
Thou art beholden / to Jupiter truly
And I beholden to plesaunt Mercury.
Join we our sterres / let me have part of thine
Co^corde to cheryss he / you shalt have part of mine
Make thou Jupiter / be frendely unto me
And our Mercury / shall be as good to the.
If thy Jupiter / give me but only gold
Mercury shall give the / gifts manyfolde
His pyllion ceptre / his wings / and his harp
If thou have all these / thou may grathly carpe
And over all these / give the shall Mercury
The knot of Hercules enlaced craftily.

Codrus. Lord god Mynalcas / why have you all this pain
This wise to forge / so many words in vain.

Mynalcas. That vain you cou^test / which may hurt or enlesse
Thy loved treasour / or mynisshe thy richesse
If thou will harken / or here my muses sing
Refresshe my mind with confort and lyking
Rydde me fro troubles and care of business
Confort my courage / which now is confortlesse
A clerk a poet / combyned with a boy
To haunt the muses / has but little joy
The wit and reason / is dull or of valor
Like as the body / is called to honor
When busy charges / causes a man to groan
The wit than slombreth / and muses all be gone
A dytie will have / mind quiet and respyte
And case of stomach / else can none well endyte
I sighe / I slombre: care troubles often my thought
When some by malice / mine art sets at naught
I heule as a kyte / for hunger and for cold
For thought and study / my youth apaereth old
My skin has wrincles and pomples all about
For cold and study / I dread me of the gout
When sickness comes / than life has breuyte
By false vukyndnesse / and wretched pouerte
If men were loving / benign / and charytable
Than were pouerte / both good and tolerable
But sith charity and pity both be gone
What should pouerte remain behind alone
No man has pity / each dayneth me to feed
I lost have confort / but still remains need
I have no wethers nor ewes in my fold
No silver in purse / I know not what is gold
Nor corn on the ground / have I whereon to fare
Than would thou have me to live void of care
Nay nay friend Codrus / trust me I the assure
Such manner salues / can not my dolor cure
Make thou me ioconde / help me with clothe and fode
Clothe me for winter / with pyltche / felt / and hode
Avoid all charges / let me sytte in my sell
Let worldly wretches / with worldly matters mell
Socour my age / regard my heeres gray
Than shalt thou prove / and se what thing I may
Than shalt thou find me both apt to write and sing
Goodwyll shall fulfill / my scarsnesse of co^nyng
A plentyfull house out chaseth thought and care
Soiorne does socour there / when althing is bare
The sellar couched with bear / ale / or wine
And meats ready when man has lust to dyne
Great barnesfull / fat wethers in the fold
The purse well stuffed / both with silver and gold
Favor of friends / and such as loves right
All these and other do make the full light
Than is it pleasure the young maidens among
To watch by the fire / the winter nights long
At their fond tales / to laughe or when they brall
Great fire and candell / spendyng for labor small
And in the ashes / some plays for to make
To cover wardeyns for faut of other warke
To tossed white sheuers / and to make prophytrolles
And after talkyng / oftymes to fill the bolles
Where welthe abounds / without rebuke or crime
Thus do some herdes / for pleasure and pastyme
As fame reports / such a shepherde there was
Which that time lived under Mecenas
And Titerus I trow / was this shepherdes name
I well remember / a live yet is his fame
He song of feldes / and tyllyng of the ground
Of sheep / of oren / and battle did be sound
So shirle he sounded / in terms eloquent
I trow his tunes / went to the firmament
The same Mecenas / to him was fre and kind
Whose large gifts / gave confort to his mind
Also this Shepherde by heavenly influence
I trow optayned his perelesse eloquence
We other shepherdes / be greatly dyfferent
Of commen sorts lean / ragged and rent
Fed with rude frowyse / with quacham or with crudde
Or slymy kempes / ill smellyng of the mudde
Such rusty meats enblyndeth so our brain
That of our favor / the Muses have disdain
And great Appollo / dispyseth that we write
For why? rude wits / but rudely does endyte.

Codrus. I trust on fortune / if it be favorable
My trust fulfylling / than shall I well be able
Thy need to socour / I hope after a thing
And if fortune fall well after my lyking
Trust me Mynalcas / I shall deliver the
Out of this trouble / care / and calamyte.

Mynalcas. A Codrus Codrus / I would to god thy will
Were this time ready / thy promise to fulfill
After the power / and might that thou have now
Thou have enough for both man / god auowe
If thy good mind / according with thy might
At this time present / you should my heart well light
I ask not the store / of Cosmus or Capell
With sylken robes / I coueyt not to mell
No kings dysshes / I coueyt nor desire
Nor rich mantels / or palles wrought in tire
No clothe of gold / of Tyssue nor velvet
Damask nor saten / nor orient Scarlet
I ask no value of Peter's costely cope
Shield of Mynerua / nor patyn of Esope
I ask no palace / nor lodging curyous
No bed of state / of raiment sumptuous
For this I learned of the deane of Poules
I tell the Codrus this man has wonsome souls
I ask no treasour / nor store of worldely good
But a quiet life / and only clothe and fode
With homely lodgyng / to keep me warm and dry
Enduryng my life / for sorthe no more ask I
If I were certain this lyueng still to have
Avoid of trouble / no more of god I crave.

Codrus. This lyueng have thou / what needs the compain?
Nothing you want / which may thy life sustain
What feel man parde / thy chekes be not thynne
No lack of vitayle / causes a double chynne

Mynalcas. Some be is lusty / and fat of his nature
Though he sore labor / and go in badde pasture
And some be again / still lean and poor is seen
Though it fatly fare / within a medowe grene
Though thou Codrus / still argue till to morrow
I lycke no dysshes / which sauced is with sorrow
Better one small dysshe / with joy and heart lyking
Than diverse denties with murmr and grutching
And men unlearned / can never be content
Whanscolers common / and clerks be present
As soon as clerks / begin to talk and chat
Some other gloumes / and has envy thereat
It is a tourment a clerk to sytte at board
Of his lernyng / not for to talk one word
Better were to be with clerks with a crust
Than at such tables / to fare at will and lust
Let me have the board of old Pytagoras
Which of temperaunce a very father was
Of philosophers the moderate richesse
In youth or age I loved never excess
Some bost and promise / and put men in confort
Of large gifts / most men be of thissort
With mouth and promise for to be lyberall
When need re^reth / than give they naught at all
All only in the is fired all my trust
If thou fail promise / than roll I in the dust
My hope is faded / than shall my song be dom
Like a nightyngale at the solsticium
If thou fail promise my confort clean is lost
Than may I hang my pype upon the post
Shytte thy shop wyndowes for lack of marcha^dice
Or else for because / that easy is the price

Codrus. Mynalcas / if thou the court of Rome have seen
With forked cappes / or else if thou have been
Or noble prelates by richesse exellent
Thou well parceyuest / they be magnifycent
With them be clerks / and plesaunt orators
And many poets promoted to honors
There is abundaunce of all that men desire
There men have honor before they it require
In such fair feldes / without labor or pain
Both wealth and richesse / you may lightly obtain

Mynalcas. Thou art abused and thynkest wrong doutlesse
To think that I am desirous of richesse
To feed on raw flesh / it is a wolves gyse
Wherefore he weneth all beestes do likewise
Because the blind man / halteth and is lame
In mind he thinks / that all men do the same
So for that thy self / desyrest good in store
All men thou iugest / infected with like sore
Codrus / I coueyt not to have abundaunce
Small thing me pleases I ask but suffisaunce
Grant me a lyueng suffycient and small
And void of troubles / I ask no more at all
But with that little / I hold me self content
If sauce of sorrow my mind not tourment
Of the court of Rome / for sothe I have herd tell
With forked cappes / it folly is to mell
Mycene and Morton / be deed and gone certain
They nor their like shall never return again
O Codrus Codrus / Augustus and Edward
Be gone forever / our fortune is more hard
The scarlet rebes / in song has small delight
What should I traueyle / in Rome is no profit
It gives mockes and skornes many fold
Still cratchyng coin / and gapyng after gold
Fraunde and disceyt / does all the world fill
And money reigns / and does althyng at will
And for that people / would more entende to gyle
Virtue and truth / be driven into eryle
We are commanded to trust for time to come
Till care and sorrow / has wasted our wisdom
Hope of reward / has poets them to feed
Now in the world / fair words be their mede.

Codrus. Than write of batayls / or acts of men bold
Or mighty princes / they may the well uphold
These worthy rulers of fame and name royal
Of very reason ought to be lyberall
Some shall thou find bitwene this place and Kent
Which for thy labor / shall the ryghtwell content.

Mynalcas. ye / some shall I find: which be so prodigal
That in vain thing / spend / and clean wastes all
But how should that man / my poverty sustain
Which naught reserueth his honor to me^tayne.
For ancient blood / nor ancient honor
In these our days / be naught without treasour
The coin auaunceth / need does the name deiect
And where is treasour / old honor has effect
But such as be rich and in promocion
Shall have my writing but in derisyon
For in this season great men of exellence
Has to poemys no greatter reverence
Than to a brothell or else a brothelshous
Mad ignorance is so contagyous.

Codrus. It is not semyng / a poet thus to jest
In wrathful speech / nor words dis honest.

Mynalcas. It is no iestyng be thou never so wroth
In open langage to say nothing but truth
If parauenture / thou would have truth kept still
Provoke thou not me / to anger at thy will
When wrath is moved / than rayson has no might
The tongue forgets discrecyon and right

Codrus. To move thy minds / I truly were full loathe
To give good counsel is far from being wroth.

Mynalcas. As touching counsel my mind is plentiful
But need and troubles / make all my reason dull
If I had counsel and gold in like plente
I tell the Codrus / I had no need of the
How should a poet / poor / bare / and indygent
Indyte the acts / of princes exellent
While scant is worth / a knyfe his pype to mende
To round the holles / to cleanse or pyke the end
Behold my whittell / almost has lost the blade
So long time past / is sith the same was made
The hafte is bruised / the blade not worth a straw
Rusty and tothed / not much unlike asawe
But touching this hurt / it is but light and small
But care and trouble / is grievous pain withal
Good counsel helps / making the wits stable
Ill counsel makes / the minds varyable
And breketh the brain / deminysshing the strength
And all the reason confounds at the length
Great men are shamed / to give thing poor or small
And great they deny / thus give they naught at all
Beside this Codrus / princes and men royal
In our enditynges / has pleasure faint and small
So much power have they / with men of might
As simple douues / when eglys take their flight
Or as great wyndes / cares for leaves dry
They live in pleasure / and welthe continually
In lust their lyking is / and in idleness
Few have their minds / from all vicyousnesse
Pleasure is thing / whereto they must entende
That they most cherisshe / they would have men co^ cende
If poets should / their manners magnify
They were supporters of blame and lechery
Than should their writing / ^e nothing commendable
Containing iestes / and deeds detestable
^f stynking Uenus / or love inordynate
Of rybaude words / which fall not for a state
Of right oppressed / and beestly glotony
Of vice auaunced / of slouthe and injury
And other deeds / in fame and worthy blame
Which were over long / here to recount or name
These to commend / Codrus do not agree
To any poet / which loves chastyte.

Codrus. What / yes Mynalcas * some have been strong and bold
Which have in battle / done acts manyfolde
With mighty courage / having them in fight
And boldly byding / for to maynteyne the right
To the could I now / rehearse welnere ascore
Of last nor richesse / setting no force ne store
Despisyng soft gold / sweet fare / and beds soft
Which in cold harnes / lie on the ground full often
Closed in iron / which when their wounds blede
Want breed and drink / them to restore and feed
While some has pleasure in soft gold orient
With cold hard iron / their mind is well content
Such were the sons / of noble lord Hawarde
Whose famous acts / may shame a faint cowarde
What could they more / but their sweet lives spend
Their princes quarrel / and right for to defend
Alas that battle / should be of that rigor
When fame and honor / tyseth and is in flower
With sudden furour than all to quence again
But boldest hertes / be nerest death certain.

Mynalcas. For certain Codrus / I can not that deny
^ucsome in battle / behave them manfully
Such as in battle / do acts marcyall
Laud worthy poets / and style heroycall
The plesaunt muses / which sounds grauyte
Had help and favor / while these were in degree
But sithe strong knights / have left their exercise
And manly virtue / corrupted is with vice
The famous poets / which ornatly endyte
Have found no matter / whereof to sing or write
The wit thus dies / of poets ancient
So does their writing / and deties eloquent
For lack of custom / thought / care / and penury
These be confounders / of plesaunt poesy
But if some prince / some king / or conqueror
Has won in arms / or battle great houour
Full little they force / for to delate their fame
That other realms / may laud or praise their name
Of time for to come / they force nothing at all
By fame and honor / to live as immortal
It them suffyseth / they count enough truly
That their own realms / their names magnify
And that for their life / they may have laud and fame
After their death / than seek they for no name
And some be untaught and learned no science
Or else they disdain / hye style of eloquence
Than stands the poet / and his poem arere
When princes disdain for to read or here
Or else some other / is drowned all in gold
By couetyse kept / in cures many fold
By flagrant ardour / inflamed in such cas
As in time past the old king Mydas was
Than of poemes / full small pleasure has he
Couetyse and clergy / full leudly does agree
Beside this Codrus / with princes commonly
Be untaught courters / fulfilled with envy
Juglers and pykers / bourders / and flatrers
Baudes and ianglers / and cursed auoutrers
And mo such other / of lyueng vicyous
To whom is virtue / aduers and odyous
These do good poets / forth of all courts chase
By thousand manners / of thretnyng and manace
Sometime by frauds / sometime by ill report
And them assysteh / all other of their sort
Like as when curres / light on a caryon
Or stinkyng rauyns / fed with corrupcion
These two all other / away does beat and chase
Because they alone / would occupy the place
For unto curres is caryon most mete
And also ^^^yns / think stynkyng things sweet
Another thing yet / is greatly more dampnable
Of rascolde poets / yet is a shameful rabble
Which void of wisdom / presumes to endyte
Though they have scautly / the connyng of a snyte
And to what vices / that princes most intend
Those dare these foles / solemnyse and commend
Than is he decked / as poet laureate
When stinkyng Thays / made him her graduate
When muses rested / she did her season note
And she with Bacchis / her camous did promote
Such rascolde drames / promoted by Thays
Bacchis Lycoris / or yet by Testilys
Or by such other / new forged muses nine
Think in their minds / for to have wit divine
They laud their verses / they bost / they vaunt and get
Though all their connyng / be scantly worth a pet
If they have smelled / the arts trinycall
They count them poets / hye and heroycall
Such is their folly / so foliss hely they dote
Thinkyng that none / can their plain error note
yet be they folysshe avoid of honest
Nothing seasoned / with spice of grauyte
Avoid of pleasure / avoid of eloquence
With many words / and frutelesse of sentence
Unapt to learn / disdayning to be tought
Their private pleasu^^ in snare so have the^ caught
And worst yet of all / they count them exellent
Though they be frutelesse / rasshe and improuident
To such ambages / who does their mind enclyne
They count all other / as private of doctrine
And that the fautes / which be in them alone
Also be common / in other men echone
Thus bide good poets / oftyme rebuke and blame
Because of other / which have dispysed name
And thus for the badde / the good be clean abject
Their art and poem / counted of none effect
Who wants reason / good to discryue from ill
Does worthy writers / enterprete at his will
So both the lauds / of good and not laudable
For lack of knowledge become vituperable.

Codrus. In faith Mynalcas / I well allow thy wit
yet would I gladly / here now some merry fytte
Of maid Maryon / or else of Roby Hode
Or bentleys Ale which chaseth well the blood
Of Pert of Norwyche / or sauce of Wylberton
Or buckysshe ioly / well stuffed as a ton
Talk of the botell / let go the book for now
Combrous is co^nyng / I make to god auowe
Speak of some mat / which may refreshe my brain
Trust me Mynalcas / I shall reward thy pain
Else talk of stoutney / when is more brain than wit
Place most abused / that we have spoke of yet.

Mynalcas. Of all these things / langage to multiply
Ercept I lied / should be but villainy
It is not semyng / a poet one to blame
All if his honor / have won dyffamed name
And though such beestes / pursue me with envy
Malgre for malice / that payment I defy
My master techeth / so does reason and skyll
That man should restore / and render good for ill

Codrus. Than talk of somewhat / lo it is long to night
yet has the son / more than one hour of light

Mynalcas. if I naught common / soundyng to grauyte
I fear to obtain / but small reward of the
But if I common of vice or wantonness
Than of our lord / shall my reward be less
Wherefore my balade shall have conclusyon
Of fruitful clauses / of noble Solomon.

Codrus. Sing on Mynalcas / he may do little thing
Which to a balade / disdayneth the heryng
But if thy dytie / accord not to my mind
Than my reward / and promise is behind
By man's manners / it lightly does appear
What men desires / that love they for to here

Mynalcas. Though in thy promise / I find no certente
yet of my connyng / shalt thou have part of me
I call no muses to give to me doctrine
But aid and confort / of strength and might divine
To clear my reason / with wisdom and prudence
To sing one balade / extract of sapyence.

AS meadows painted / with flowers redolent
The sight reioyseth / of such as the^ behold
So man endewed / with virtue exellent
Fragrantly shyneth / with beams many fold
Virtue with wisdom / excedeth store of gold
If richesse habounde / set not on them thy trust
When strength is sturdy / than man is perte and bold
But wit and wisdom soon leyeth him in the dust.
Than man is beestly / which seweth carnal lust
Spend not on women / thy richesse or substance
For lack of vsyng / as steel or iron rust
So rusteth reason / by wylfull ignorance
In fraudefull beauty / set thou but small pleasaunce
A plesaunt apple / is often corrupt within
Ground the in youth / on goodly governance
It is good token / when man does well begin.
Joye not in malice / that is a mortal sin
Man is parceyued / by langage and doctrine
Better is to lose / than wrongfully to win
He loves wisdom / which loves disciplyne
Rasshe enterprises / often brings to ruin
A man may contend / god gives victory
Set never thy mind on thing which is not thine
Trust not in honor all welthe is transitory.
Combyne thou thy tongue / with reason and memory
Speak not to hasty / without aduysement
So live in this life / that thou may trust on glory
Which is not caduke / but lastyng parmanent
There is no secret / with people vyuolent
By beestly surfeit / the life is breuyate
Though some have pleasure / in sumptuous garment
yet goodly manners / him makes more ornate.
Codrus. Ho there Myaclas / of this have we enough
What should a plouman / go farther tha^ his plough
What should a shepherde / in wisdom wade so far
Talk of his tankarde / or of his bor of tar
Tell some what else / wherein is more conforte
So shall the season / and time seem light and short

Mynalcas. For thou of Hawarde / now lately did recyte
I have a dytie which Cornir did endyte
His death complaining / but it is lamentable
To here a captain / so good and honorable
So soon withdrawn by dethes cruelte
Before his virtue / was at most high degree
If death for reason / had showed him favor
To all his nacyon / he should have been honor
Alas / bold hertes / be nerest death in war
When out of danger / cowardes stand a far.

Codrus. All if that ditye / be never so lamentable
Refrain my tears / I shall as I am able
Begin Mynalcas / tell of the bold Hawarde
If fortune favor / hope after some reward.

Mynalcas. I pray the Codrus / my whey is weke and thyn
Len me thy botell / to drink or I begin.

Codrus. If ought be tasted / the remnaunt shall pall
I may not before the / now for to spend out all
We sytte in shadow / the son is not fervent
Call for it after / than I shall be content.

Mynalcas. Still thou desyrest / the pleasure of my art
But of thy botell / naught will thou yet depart
Though you be negarde / and naught wylt give of thine
yet this one time / thou shall have part of mine
Now harken Codrus / I tell mine elegy
But small is the pleasure / of doleful armony.

The discrypcion of the tower of Virtue and Honor / in to which the noble
Hawarde contended to enter / by worthy acts of chiualry.


Mynalcas speaks. High on a mountain / of highness marvelous
With pe^dant clyffes / of stones hard as flent
Is made a castle / or toure most curyous
Dredefull unto sight / but inward exellent
Such as would enter / find paynes-tourment
So hard is the way / unto the same mountain
Straight / hye / and thorny / tournyng and dyfferent
That many labor / for to ascend in vain.
Who does persevere / and to this toure attain
Shall have great pleasure / to se the bylding old
Joined and graued / surmountyng man's brain
And all the walls within of fynest gold
With old hystories / and pyctures many fold
Glystring as bright / as Phoebus orient
With marbyll pyllers / the bylding to uphold
About the turrettes / of shape most exellent.
This toure is gotten / by labor dilygent
In it remains / such as have won honor
By holy lyueng / by strength or tournament
And most by wisdom / attain unto this tour
Brefely all people / of godly behauour
By rightwyse battle justice and equity
Or that in mercy / have had a chief pleasure
In it have rowmes / each after his degree
This goodly castle / thus shinyng in beauty
Is named castle / of virtue and honor
In it eight Henry / is in his mageste
Most hye enhaunsed / as ought a conqueror
In it remains the worthy governor
A stock and fountain / of noble progeny
Most noble Hawarde / the duke and protector
Named of Northfolke / the flower of chiualry.
Here is the Talbot / manfull and hardy
With other princes / and men of dignyte
Which to win honor does all their might apply
Supportyng justice / concord / and equity
The manly Corson / within this toure I se
These have we seen / echone in his estate
With many other / of hye and mean degree
For mercy all acts / with crowns laureate.
Of this strong castle / is porter at the gate
Strong sturdy labor / much like a champyon
But goodly virtue / a lady most ornate
Within governs / with great prouisyon
But of this castle / in the most highest trone
Is honor shinyng / in rowme imperyall
Which unrewarded / of them leueth not one
That come by labor / and virtue princypall.
Ferefull is labor / without favor at all
Dredefull of vysage / a monster vntretable
Like Cerberus lyeng / at gates infernal
To some men his look / is half intolerable
His shulders large / for burden strong and able
His body bristled / his neck mighty and styffe
By stourdy senewes / his joints strong and stable
Like marbyll stones / his hands be as styffe.
Here must man vanquysshe / the dragon of Cadmus
Again the Chymer / here stoutly must he ^^ght
Here must he vanquysshe / the ferefull Pegasus
For the golden flese / here must he show his might
If labor gainsay / he can nothing be right
This monster labor / often changes his figure
Sometime an ore / a bore / or lion wight
Plainly he seems / thus chaungyng his nature.
Like as Protheus / often changed his stature
Mutable of figure / oftymes in one hour
When Aristeus / in bonds had him sure
To diverse fygures likewise changes labor
Under his brows he dredefully does lour
With glystring eyes / and side dependant berde
For thurst and hunger / always his chere is sour
His horned forheed / does make faint hertes ferde.
Always he drinks / and yet always is dry
The sweat distyllyng / worth drops habu^dant
His breast and forheed / does humor multiply
By swetyng shoures / yet is this pain pleasant
Of day and of night / his restyng time is scant
No day ouerpasseth / exempt of business
His sight enfourmeth / the rude and ignorant
Who dare parseuer / he gives them richesse.
None he auaunceth / but after steadfastness
Of little burden / his belly is and small
His mighty thyes / his vigor does express
His shankes sturdy / and large fete withal
By wrath he rages / and still does chyde and brall
Such as would enter / repellyng with his cry
As well estates / as homely men rural
At the first enter / he thretneth yrefully.
I trow old fathers / whom men now magnify
Called this monster / Mynerua stout and sour
For strength and senewes / of man most comenly
Are tame and febled / by cures and labor
Like as becomes / a knight to fortify
His princes quarrel / with right and equite
So did this Hawarde / with courage valtantly
Till death abated / his bold and acyte.
O happy Sampson / more fortunate than he
Only in strength / but not in hye courage
O cruel fortune / why durst thy cruelte
This flour of knighthode / to slay in lusty age
Thou have debated / the flour of his lynage
If thou had mercy / bewail his death thou might
For cruel lions / and mo beestes savage
Long time not cessed / sore to bewail this knight
O death thou have done / against both law and right
To spare a cowarde / without danger or wound
And thus soon to quench / of chiualry the light
O death enuyous / most enmy to our ground
What most aueyleth / thou sonest do confound
Why did not virtue / assyst her champyon
Thou might have aided / for sothly thou was bound
For during his life / he loved the alone.
O god almighty / in thy eternal trone
To whom all virtue / is dear and acceptable
If reason suffered / to the our cry and moan
This deed might impute / and fortune lamentable
Thou might have left us / this knight most honorable
Our welthe and honor / to have kept in degree
Alas why has death / so false and disceyuable
Mankind to tourment / this will and lyberte.
It quenches virtue / sparyng iniquite
The best it stryketh / of badde having disdain
No help nor confort / has our aduersyte
Death daily strikes / though we daily compain
To treat a tyranne / it is but thing in vain
Meekness provoke / his wrath and tyranny
So at out prayer / death has the more disdain
We do by meekness / his furour multiply.
If some fell tyranne / replete with villainy
Should thus have endyng / the deed were commendable
But a stout captain / disposed to mercy
So soon thus faded / the case lamentable
Was he not humble / ioconde and companable
No man dispysing / and first in all labor
Rightwyse with mercy / debonaire and tretable
Mate and companyon / with every soudyour.
Uyce he subdued / by goodly behauour
Like as a ryder / does a wild stead subdue
His body subget / his soul was governor
From vice withdrawn / to goodness and virtue
When pride rebelled / meekness did eschew
Fre mind and alms / subdued auaryce
Always he noted / this saying just and true
That noble minds / dispyseth couetyse.
His death declares / that slouthe he did espyse
By hardy courage / as first in ieopardy
Always he used / some noble exercise
Such as belongs / to noble chiualry
In him was there found / no sparcle of envy
Always he lauded / and praised worthynesse
Such as were doughty / rewardyng largely
Wrath save in season / he wisely could repress.
Of wine or Bacchus / despised he excess
For minds kyndled to acts mercyall
Sekyng for honor / and name of doughtynesse
Despyseth surfeit / and lyueng beestyall
In him no power / had lust veneryall
For busy labor / and plesaunt abstynence
All corporal lust / soon causes for to fall
No lust subdueth where reigns dilygence
He was a pyller / of sober contynence
His only treasure / and iowell was good name
But O cursed death / thy wrathful vyolnece
By stroke vnwarned / half blinded of his fame
Who may I accuse? who may I put in blame?
God for death / or fortune / or impotent nature
God does his pleasure / and death will have the same
Nature was mighty / long able to endure.
In fortune the faut is / hold now am I sure
I would if I durst / his tyranny accuse
O cursed fortune / if thou be creature
Who gave the power / thus people to abuse
Thy mutable might / me causes often to muse
When man is plunged / in dolor and distress
Thy face thou chaungest / which did erst refuse
By so dayne chances / him liftyng to richesse.
And such as long time / have lived in nobles
Anon thou plungest / in pain and pouerte
Welthe / honor / strength / right / justice / and goodness
Misery / dolor / low room / and iniquyte
These thou rewardest / like as it pleases the
To man's merit / without respect at all
One this day being / in great authorite
Again to morrow / thou causest for to fall.
When man is worthy / a room imperyall
On him thou gloumest / with froward cou^tena^ce
Weyke is thy promise / reuoluyng as a ball
Thou have no favor / to godly governance
No man by merit / thou use to auance
O blinded fortune / oftyme unfortunate
When man the trusts / than falls some myschance
Unwarely chaungyng / his fortune and estate.
Tell me frail fortune / why did thou breuyate
The lyueng season / of such a captain
That when his acts ought to be laureate
Thy favor turned / him suffering to be slain
I blame the fortune / and the excuse again
For though thy favor / to him was rigorous
Such is thy custom / for to be uncertain
And namely when man / is hye and glorious.
But most worthy duke / hye and vyctorious
Respyre to conforte / se the vncertaynte
Of other princes / whose fortune prosperous
Oftyme has ended / in hard aduersyte
Read of Pompeius / whose pereles dignyte
Again great Caesar / did welthe of Rome defend
Whom after fortune / brought in captiuyte
That he in Egypt / was heeded at the end.
In like wise Caesar / which did with him co^tende
When all the world / to him was subyngate
From his hye honor / did suddenly discende
Murdered in Rome / by chance unfortunate
Cato an Seneke / with Tully Rewreate
These and mo like / for all their sapyence
Has proved fortune / sore blynding their estate
By wrongful sclaunders / and deedly violence.
To poor and rich / it has no difference
Old Polycraces / supposyng peril past
With death dis honest / ended his exellence
Great Alexander by fortune / was down cast
One draught of poison / him filled at the last
Whom all the world / erst could not sacyate
What is all honor / and power but a blast?
When fortune thretneth / the life to breuyate
Behold on Pyrrus / the king unfortunate
With a small stone / deed prostrate on the ground
Se Ualeryan brought down from his estate
From his empire / in Percy thrall and bound
Of old Priamus / it is in writing found
How h^by* Pyrrus / was in his paleis slain
Paris and Hector / received mortal wound
To trust in fortune / it is a thing in vain.
The mighty Cyrus / a king of realms twain
Was slain and his host / of Thomyrus the queen
Thus is no matter / of fortune to complain
All that new falls / of old time has bensene
This shall be / this is / and this has ever been
That bold hertes / be nerest ieopardy
To dye in battle / is honor as men wene
To such as have joy / in hauntyng chiualry.
Such famous endyng / the name does magnify
Note worthy duke / no cause is to complain
His life not ended / foul nor dishonestly
In bed nor tavern / his lusts to meyntayne
But like as besemed / a noble captain
In sturdy harness / he dyed for the right
From dethes danger / no man may fly certain
But such death is metest / unto a noble knight.
But death it to call / me think it is unright
Sith his worthy name / shall last parpetuall
To all his nation / example and clear light
But to his progeny / most specially of all
His soul is in pleasure / of glory eternal
So duke most doughty / joy may that noble tree
Whose branches honor / shall never fade ne fall
While be is in earth / or fysshes in the sea.
Lo Codrus / I here have told the by and by
Of shepherde Cornir / the woeful elegy
Wherein he mourned / the grievous pain and hard
And last departing / of noble lord Hawarde
More he endyted / of this good admyrall
But truly Codrus / I can not tell the all.

Codrus. Mynalcas / I swear by holy Peter's cope
If all thing fortune / as I have trust and hope
if happy wind blow / I shall or it be long
Comfort thy sorrow / and well reward thy song
What trust man a while / till better fortune come
if my part be any / than shall thy part be some.

Mynalcas. if thou in purpose / so to reward my hyre
God grant the Codrus / thy wysshing and desire.

Codrus. Forsothe Mynalcas / I wysshe the so in deed
And that shall you know / if fortune with me speed
Farewell Mynalcas / for this time dieu te guard
Nere is winter / the world is to hard.

Mynalcas. Go wretched ingarde / god send the care and pain
Our lord let the never / come hyder more again
And as did Mydas / god turn it all to gold
That ever thou touchest / or shalt in hands hold
For so much on gold / is fired thy lyking
That thou dispysest / both virtue and co^nyng.

Here after follows the Prologe.
IN cold January / when fire is comfortable
And that the feldes / be nere intolerable
When sheep and pastoures / leueth field and fold
And draw to cotes / for to eschew y^ cold
What time the verdure / of ground and every tree
By frost and storms / is pryuate of beauty
And every small bird / thinks the winter long
Which well apereth / by ceasynge of their song
At this same season / two herdes / fresshe of age
At time appointed / met both in one cotage
The first hight Faustus / the second Amyntas
Hard was to know / which better husband was
For each of them both / set more by pleasour
Than by habundaunce / of riches or tresour
Amyntas was formalle / and propre in his gere
A man on his cloak / should not aspyed a here
Nor of his clothing / one wryncle stood a wrye
In london he learned / to go so manerly
High on his bonet / stacke a fair broche of tynne
His pursys lynynge / was simple poor and thynne
But a lords stomach / and a beggars pouche
Full ill accords / such was this comely slouche
In the town and cite / so long getted had he
That from thens he fled / for det and pouerte
No wafrer / tavern / halehous / or tauerner
To him was there hid / while he was hosteler
First was he hosteler / and than a wafrer
Than a costermonger / and last a tauerner
About all London / there was no propre prym
But long time had been / famylyer with him
But when coin failed no fanour more had he
Wherefore he was glad / out of the town to fle
But sheep herd Faustus / was yet more fortunate
For always was he / content with his estate
Yet nothing he had / to conforte him in age
Save a melche cow / and a poor cotage
The town he used / and great pleasure had
To se the cite / oftyme while he was ladde
For milk and votter / he thither brought to sell
But never thought he / in cite for to dwell
For well he noted / the mad enormyte
Envy / fraud / malice / and such myquyte
Which reygne in cytes / therefore he led his life
Up land in vyllage / without debate and strife
When these two herdes / were thus together met
Having no charges / nor labor them to let
Their sheep were all sure / and closyd in a cote
Themself lay in lyttre / pleasauntly and hot
For costly was fire / in hardest of the year
Wha^ men have most need / tha^ every thing is dear
For passing of time / and recreacyon
The both delyted / in co^munycacyon
Namely they pledyd / of the dyuersyte
Of rural husbondes / and men of the cite
Fastus accused / and blamed Cytezyns
To them imputynge / great fautes crime and sins
Amyntas blamed / the rural men again
And each of the^ both / his quareyl did maynteyne
All wroth despised / all malice and ill will
Clean laid a part / each did rehearse his skyll
But first Amyntas / thus for to speak began
As he which counted / himself the better man
Finis Prologe.
Interlocutoures be Amyntas and Faustus.


Amyntas first speaks. THe winter snowes / all covered is the ground
The northewynde blowys / all with a fereful sou^de
The long yse sycles / at the he wsys honge
The streams frosen / the night is cold and long
Where botes rowed / now carts have passage
From yoke the oxen / be lowsed and bondage
The ploweman rests / avoid of all business
Save when he tends / his harms for to dress
Mably his wife / sytteth before the fire
All black and smoke / clothed in rude atyre
Seething some grewell / and sterynge the pulment
Of peese or frument / a noble meet for lent
The somer season / men counts now laudable
Whose fervor before / they thought intolerable
The frosty winter / and weder temperate
Which me^ tha^ praised / they now dyspryse and hate
Cold they desired / but now it is present
The braule and grutche / their minds not content
Thus mutable men / them pleased can not hold
At great hete grutchy^g / and grutehy^g wha^ it is cold

Faustus. All pleasure present / of men is counted small
Desire obtained / some counts naught at all
What men hope after / that seems great and dear
At light by dystaunce / apereth great and clear.

Amyntas. Each time and season / has his delight and Joys
Look in the streets / behold the little boys
How in fruit season / for Joye they sing and hope
In lent echeone / full busy is with his tope
And now in winter / for all the grievous cold
All rent and ragyd / a man may them behold
They have great pleasure / supposing well to dyne
When men ben busyed / in killing of fat swyne
They get the bladder / and blow it great tand thyn
With many beans / or peasen bound within
It ratleth / sounds / and shyneth clear and fair
While it is thrown / and cast up in the air
Each eone contendeth / and has a great delight
With foot or with hand / the bladder for to smite
If it fall to ground / they lift it up again
This wise to labor / they count it for no pain
Rennynge and lepynge / they drive away the cold
The sturdy plowmen / lusty strong and bold
Ouercometh the winter / with dryuynge the foot ball
For getynge labor / and many a grievous fall

Faustus. Men labor sorer / in fruyteles vanyte
Than in fair warkes / of great vtylyte
In such thryftles / we labor for damage
Warke we despise / which brings advantage

Amyntas. Towchynge their labor / it can not me dysplease
While we be in rest / and better here at ease
In the warm lyttre / small pain has little hyre
Here may we walowe / while milk is on the fire
If it be crudded / of bread we need no crome
If thou bide Faustus / thereof thou shalt have some

Faustus. Winter declares / hard need and pouerte
Than men it feleth / which have necessyte
Treuly Amyntas / I tell the mine intent
We fond young people / be much improuydent
We straye in somer / without thought / care / or head
Of such thing as we / in winter shall have need
As soon as we here / a bagpype or a drown
Than leave we labor / there is our monaye gone
But when the north wind / with storms vyolent
Has brought cold wy^ter / pore wretches to turme^t
And void of leaves / is every bow and tree
That one may clearly / the emty nestes se
Than is all our woll / and lambs gone and sold
We tremble naked / and dye almost for cold
Our sholders all bare / our hose and shows rent
By retcheles youth / thus all is gone and spent
This comes for wantynge / of good prouysyon
Youth dayneth counsel / scornynge dyscrecyon
When puerte thus / has caught us in his snare
Than does the winter / our mad folly declare
Now treuly Amyntas / I tell the my mate
That town dwellers live / gretely more fortunate
And somewhat wyser / be they also than we
They gather treasoure / and riches in plente
They spoil the lambs / and foxys of the skin
To lap their wombes / and fat sides therein
In lust in pleasure / and in good habundaunce
Pass they their lives / we have not suffysaunce

Amyntas. The men of the earth / be fools euerychone
We poor shepeherdes / be not to blame alone
More folly vexes / the man of the Cite
I grant us ouersene / they madder be than we
Though I long season / did in the cite dwell
I favor it not / truth dare I boldly tell
Though Cytezyns be / oflyuynge reprouable
Yet fortune to them / is much more favorable
Fortune to them / is like a mother dear
As a stepmoder / she does to us apere
Them she exalts / to honor and richesse
Us she oppresses / in care and wretchydnesse
What is vain fortune / but thing bytuperable
An unhappy madness / unworthy and unstable

Faustus. No doubt Amyntas / let me be fortunate
And than shall I soon / become a great estate
My coin shall increase / than shortly shall I be
Called to office / to govern a cite
All men shall here me / and give me credence
The comonte bareheed / shall do me reverence
All other rules / low men and comonte
Shall gladly desire / to have advise of me
If I be happy / and fortune on me smyle
Thus shall I assende / and mount within a while
Ask thou of Cornyx / declare to the he can
How coin more than co^nynge / exalts many man

Amyntas. O Faustus Faustus / thou erres from the way
This is not fortune / full little do she may
Though I myself / rehearsed but lately
That fortune has might / a man to magnyfy
I keep the opinion / of wytles comonte
And grounded myself / on none auctoryte
It is not fortune / that grants excellence
True honor is won / by virtue and science
If men get honor / by other polecy
It is no honor / but wretched mysery
God makes mighty / god gives true honor
To godly persons / of godly behauyour
God first dysposed / and made dyuersyte
Between rude plowmen / and men of the Cite
And in what manner / Cornyx thine own mate
As we went talking / recounted to me late

Faustus. What told the Cornyx / / tell me I the pray
He had good reason / such things to conuaye
His wit was pregnant / no reason did he want
But truth to declare / his monaye was but scant
But what than / some man has pleynte of cunning
Which has of richesse / small pleynte or nothing

Amyntas. In herynge my tale / if thou have thy delight
Than take some labor / for now is good respyte
Faustus arise thou / out of thy lyttre hot
Go se and vysyte / our wethers in the cote
Arise go and come / thou art both young and able
After great cold / hete is more comfortable
Go man for shame / he is a slothful dawe
Which leueth profit / for pleasure of hot straw

Faustus. Think not Amyntas / that Fastus has dysdayne
To do thy pleasure / I shall refuse no pain
Look here Amyntas / lord benedycyte
The cold snow recheth / much higher tha^ my kne
Scant may the houses / such burden well sustain
Less hurt is tempest / and sudden storm of rain
On top of the chymnaye / there is an hepe of snow
So hye extendynge / our steple is more low
The snow is so white / and the son so bright
That plainly Amyntas / amasyd is my sight

Amyntas. Give to the bestes / good rowen in pleynte
And stop all the holes / where thou can fautes se
Stop them with stubbyll / efte daube them with some claye
And when you have done than come again thy way
Naught is more noysom / to flock / cotage / ne fold
Than sudden tempest / and unprovided cold
What now all ready / friend Faustus here again
By short conclusyon / bad warke apereth plain
Thy coming again / me think is all to soon
Ought to have mended / or profit to have done

Faustus. This combrous wether / made me more dylygent
I ran all the way / both as I came and went
And there I spedde me / and took the greter pain
Because I lightly / would be with the again
After great cold / it is full sweet god wot
To tomble in the straw / or in the lyttre hot
Now be we Fastus / in hey up to the chynne
Fully thy promise / I pray the now begin
Tell the beginning / of the dyuersyte
Between rural men / and men of the cite
I know the reason / and talking of Cornyx
But sith I him saw / be passed years six
His iocunde Jestes / made me oftetyme full glad
Our first acquayntau^ce / was when I was a ladde
Now speak my Faustus / and I shall hold me still
Till thou have ended / and spoken all thy will

Amyntas. This great dyfference / and first dyuersyte
Between rural men / and them of the cite
Began in this wise / as cornyx me told
Which well could common / of many matters old
First when the world / was fourmed and create
And Adam with Eve / were set in their estate
Our lord conjoined them both / as man and wife
To live in concord / the season of their life
And them commanded / mankind to multyply
By generacyon / to get them progeny
They both obeyed / this sweet commandment
With faithful hertes / and labor dylygent
But would to Jhesu / they had been wise and ware
From y^ fatal fruit / which kyndled all their care
But to my purpose / first Eve had children two
A sone and a daughter / our lord dysposed so
And so year by year / two twynnes forth she brought
When god assysteth / man works not for naught
By such manner / these two did them apply
The world to sulfyll / increase and multyply
At last our lord / at end of fyftene year
To Eve our mother / did on a time appear
And in what manner / now here me Amyntas
Adam on the field / forth with his wethers was
His flock than he fed / without all dread and fere
Than were no wowers / him nor his wife to dear
He was not troubled / that time with Jelowsy
Than was no body / to do that vylany
No horned kyddes / were living at that time
Long after this / began this cursed crime
Than was no cocko / between the eest and west
To lay wrong eggs / within a strange nest
Than none suspected / the living of his wife
Weclocke was quiet / and pleasant without strife
But after when people / began to multyply
Than first was kyndled / the flame of Jelowsy
For that man commynteth / sore dredeth he again
Fraud fereth falshode / suspectynge often in vain
Than fle she in have / for to have pleasour more
And them presented / whom she had hid before
And vnrequyred / presentynge them said she
O lord these also / my very children be
These be the fruit / also of my womb
Hyd for shame fastness / within my house at home
O lord most my ghty / hye fader cretour
Withsaue to grant them / some office of honor
Their here was ruggyd / poudred all with chafe
Some full of strawes / some other full of draffe
Some with cobwebbes / and dust were so arrayed
That one beholdynge on them / might be afraid
Black was their color / and bad was their figure
Uncomely to sight / mysshapen of stature
Our lord not smyled on them / to show pleasaunce
But said to them thus / with trowbled cou^tenau^ce
Ye smell all smoky / of stubbyll and of chafe
Ye smell of the ground / of wedes und of draffe
And after your sent / and tedyous sauoure
Shall be your to wines / and all your behauour
None can a pytcher / turn to a silver piece
Nor make goodly sylke / of a gotes flece
And hard is also / to make withouten fail
A bright two hand sword / of a cowes tail
No More will I make / how be it that I can
Of a vile vylayne / a noble gentylman
Ye shall be plowemen / and tyllers of the ground
To pain and labor / shall ye always be bound
Some shall keep oxen / and some shall hogs keep
Some shall be thresshers / some other shall keep sheep
To dyg and to delue / to hedge and to dyke
Take this for your lot / and other labor like
To drudge and to dreuyll / in warkes vile and rude
This wise shall ye live / in endeles seruytude
Ryppynge / and mowynge / of fother gras and corn
Yet shall town dwellers / often laughe you unto scorfi
Yet some shall we grant / to dwell in the cite
For to make podynges / or butchers for to be
Cobblers / or tynkers / or else costard Jaggers
Hostelers / or daubers / or drowpy water laggers
And such other sort / whose daily business
Passes in warkes / and labor of vylenes
To stowpe / and to sweet / and subject to become
And never to be rydde / from bondage and thraldom
Than broughtour lord / to them the carte and harowe
The gad / and the whyp / ye matoke and the whelebarow
The spade / the shouell / the forke and the ploughe
And all such towles / than bad he them be toughe
And never to grutche / at labor nor at pain
For if they so did / it should be thing in vain
Thus said the father / and lord omny potent
And than he ascended / up to the tyrmament
Thus began honor / and thus began bondage
And dyuersyte / of cite and vyllage
And seruyle labor / first in this wise began
Demand of Cornyx / declare the truth he can
This told me Cornyx / whiched welled in the fen
I trust his saying / before a thousand men

Faustus. Is this the matter / praised of the so sore
Astra we for fables / I set by them no store
It were a marvel / if Cornyx matter told
To laud of she peherdes / or plowmen to uphold
He dwelt in the town / and held with the cite
Till need him mouyd / as it has driven the
When none of you both / dare to the town resort
Among us shepeherdes / yet find ye here conforte
So both thou and he / be gretely for to blame
To ete our vytayle / and than to hurt our name
The young men of towns / to mock us have a guyse
Naught else can they do / save lies to deuyse
This vain inuencyon / and folysshe feigned fable
Again rural men / they have delight to babble
And naught they asshame / as bly^de wretches unwise
Of god almighty / such leasynges to deuyse
This scorfy scoftynge / declares openly
Against rural men / rebuke and injury
But thou art so rude / thy paunche is so fat
Again thine owneselfe / thou busy art to chatte
Alyfe this same Jest / is thy rebuke and blame
Thy dullyd reason / can not perceive the same
But I wall prove the / that rural people be
More wise and noble / than they of the cite
And that the cite / is full of fraud and strife
When we in vyllage / have good and quiet life

Amyntas. I pray the Fastus / herefore be thou not wroth
To have dyspleasoure of the / I were right loathe
I thought no mawgre / I told it for a bourde
If I had known / I should have said noworde
But say thy pleasure / now tell for the thy sentence
And I shall here the / with sobre pacyence

Faustus. I shall not deny / our pain and seruytude
I know that plowmen / for the most part be rude
Now shall I tell the / high matters true and old
Which curteys Candydus / unto me ones told
Naught shall I forge / nor of no leasing babble
This is true hystory / and no surmysed fable
At the benynnynge / of things first of all
God made shepeherdes / and other men rural
But the first plowman / and tyller of the ground
Was rude and stordy / dysdaynynge to be bound
Rughe and stoborne / and Cayn did men him call
He had no mercy / and pity none at all
But like as the ground / is dull / stony / and toughe
Stubberne and heavy / rebellynge to the ploughe
So the first ploughman / was strong and obstynate
Froward self willing / and mouer of debate
But the first shepeherde / was meke and nothing fell
Humble as is a lamb / and called was Abell
A sheep gives milk / and little has of gall
So this good Abell / had none ill will at all
No shepeherde found him / iniuryous nor wrong
In during his life / while he was them among
And often of his flock / made he good sacryfyce
Of calfe or lambs / such as were most of price
And of fat wethers / the best not spared he
To honor our lord / and pease his deyte
Thus had he favor / with god omny potent
So pleasynge our lord / that to this time present
From first beginning / of earth* and man mortal
God has had favor / to people pastoral
And poor shepeherdes / their cotes / field and sheep
Aungelles have come / for to defend and keep
Some shepeherdes were / in land of asserye
Thiche after have been / promoted very hye
So that from cotes / and houses pastoral
They have ascended / to dygnyte royal
Chargys and labor / so does my reason blind
That call their names / can I not unto mind
Yet let me stody / avoiding pertur baunce
So may I call them / unto my remembrance
Lo now I have them / Abraham / and I co b
Lot / I saac / young Joseph / and Job
These now rehearsed / and all the patryarches
Have not dysdayned / pore sheep nor herdes warkes
Them has our lord / called from humble things
And made them princes / dukes / other kings
So have they changed / their clothing pastoral
With golden garment / purpure / and gaye pall
And than have after by magnanymyte
Brought noble royalmes / in their captyuyte
And have in battle / ben mighty conquerours
Won fame immortal / and excellent honors
Paris was pastor / the sone of Pryamus
Pan / Sylene / Orpheus / and Joly Tyterus
Sawll was shepherde / so was he in likewise
Which would have offered / his sone in sacryfyse
Moses was shepherde / and was his flock keeping
When he came barefote / unto the busshe flamynge
Co^mannded by god / to leave his flock and go
On gods message / to sturdy Pharao
Also Apollo was herd / sometime in Greece
Nothing dysdaynynge / to handle ewe and flece
As writes poets / he left dyuyne honor
Glad among wethers / to be a governor
The blessed aungelles / brought to such men as we
Message of concord / of peace / and unity
And song that gloria / styenge in the sky
Which out sir Sapson / does sing so merely
First had shepeherdes / sure tydynge by message
That god was made man / to bye hamayne lynage
And he^oes instruct / by voice angelycall
Saw god incarnate / and borne first of all
And this was pleasour / of gods majesty
That simple herdes / him first of all soulde se
And in their manner / make unto him offrynges
Before estates / as rich and mighty kings
The ioly harper / which after was a king
And slew the gyaunt / so stoutly with his slynge
Was first a shepeherde / or he had dygnyte
Right so were many / as stout and bold as he
And our lord Ihesu / our god and savior
Named himself / a shepeherde or a pastor
Right so he named / men meke and pacyent
His flock and his sheep / for manners innocent
Think not these words / glosyd nor in vain
They are the gospel / so says sir Peter plain
I saw them myself / well painted on the wall
Late gasynge upon / our church cathedral
I saw great wethers / in pycture and small lambs
Dauncynge / some slepynge / some so wky^ge of their da^mes
And some on y^ ground / me seemed lyenge still
Than saw I horsemen / at pendant of an hill
And the three kings / with all their company
Their crowns gly werynge / bright and oryently
With their presents / and gystes mystycall
All this beheld I / in pycture on the wall
But the poor pastoures / as people innocent
First saw the Cryb / of our lord omnypotent
Thus it apereth / god loves poor pastors
Seth he them granted / to have to great honors
Our lord has favor / both in the sheep and fold
As it apereth / by the hostoryes old
Our lord is ready / to socour the vyllage
Despysynge towns / for malice and outrage
For god is content / with simple pouerte
Pride he despyseth / and wrongful dygnyte

Amyntas. In good faith Fastus / thy tale is verytable
Grounded on learning / and greatly commendable
Lately myself / to se that pycture was
I saw the manger / I saw the ox and ass
I well remembered / the people in my mind
Me think yet I se / the black facys of ynde
Me think yet I se / the herdes and the kings
And in what manner / were ordered their offrynges
As long as I live / the better shall I love
The name of herdes / and cytezyns reprove
Wherefore mate Fastus / I pray god give the care
If thou the fautes / of any cite spare
Speak on / and spare not / and touch their error
Yet may me common / more than a large hour.

Faustus. Than turn we to talk / a while of Cysezyns
To touch their folly / and parcel of their sins
Think not Amyntas / that they of the cite
Live better life / or wyselyer than we
All if their clothing / be doubled for the cold
And though they glyster / so gayly in bright gold
Shynynge in sylkes / in purpure / or velvet
In furryd robys / or clokes of scarlet
And we poor herdes / in russet cloak and hode
It is not clothing / can make a man be good
Better in in rags / pure living innocent
Than a soul delyled / in sumptuous garment
Trust me Amyntas / my self with thesesame eyes
Have in the cite / such oftentimes seen
Jet in their sylkes / and brag in the market
As they were lords / I often have seen them Jet
Which are stark beggars / and live in need at home
And often go to bed / for need with empty womb
Naught is more folysshe / than such wretches be
Thus with proud port / to cloak their pouerte
What is need clohed / or feigned habundaunce
Pouerte / slouthe / and wretched governance
What is fair semblau^ce / with thought and heaviness
Forsooth naught else / but cloked folysshnes
And some have I seen / which is a thing damnable
That whylethey would have / a lyuy^ge delectable
Rest at their pleasure / and fare delycyoully
Have suffered their wives / defiled wyttyngly
Have sold their daughters / flower of vyrgynyte
O deed unworthy / O blind inyquyte
Fame honor the soul / and chastyte be sold
For wretchyd living / o cursed thurst of gold
O damnable deed / so many for to spyll
One wretchyd carkes / and belly for to fill
What thing is vyler / what more abhomynable
What thing more folysshe / more falls and detestable.

Amyntas. What if they can not / to other craft them give
Nor find ather way / or means for to live
Need has no law / of two ylles parde
To chose the leest ill / is none iniquyte

Faustus. Seth they have as many / souls as have we
As much of reasone / and hands like plente
Why may they not to honest warke the^ give
And find other way / and manner for to live
No law permytteth / nor wylleth man parde
To commyt mordre / for hard neressyte
No More should any / his soul defyle nor kill
For lust transytory / or pleasure to fulfill
Yet be in cytees / mo suenge folysshnes
Wenynge by craft / for to have great riches
By which crafts / no man has riches found
Sith time y^ our lord / first fourmed man and ground
As Alkemystys / wenynge by polecy
Nature to alter / and coin to multyply
Some wasshe rude metal / with lycours many fold
Of herbs wenynge / to turn in to gold
All pale and smoky / by such contynuall
And after labor / they lose their life and all
An other sort is / to this not much unlike
Which spe^de their times / i^ wretehyd art magyke
Thereby supposing / some treasour to have found
Which many years / is hid within the ground
What is more folysshe / more full of vanyte
Or more repugnynge / to fay the and probyte
Because they would fle / good business and pain
They use such tryfles / and wretched things vain
They prove all things / because the would do naught
Still seky^ge news / still troubled i^ their thought
Because they would fle / the labor of the land
All idle tryfles / such takes on their hand
Styli be they busy / and never come to end
To thing profitable / do few of them intend
Some live by rapyne / gyle / fraud and polecy
Pariury opprelsyon / and some in usury
Some gladly borowe / and never pay again
Some keep from servants / ye stipe^d of their pain
Some rest men gyltles / and cast them in prison
Some by strong thieves / out of the dongyon
Some fawn some flater / man trust not wha^ they smyle
Than frame the frauds / men slyly to begyle
Some in one hour / more promise to the will
Than all his days / he thinks to fulfill
By thousand means / of fraud and craftynesse
Ly they in wait / for honor and richesse
They feed the rich / and often let the pore
Dye for pure cold / and hungre at their door
We feed fat oxen / they Marmosettes keep
We feed fat Kyddes / Lambs / and good sheep
And they feed hawes / apes / also hounds
And small is their Joye / save here wtin our bounds
We bring them butter / eggs / chese / and woll
Tancardes of mylde / and cream fletynge full
All manner flesh / and all their hole living
Without our labor / treuly they have nothing
We are the feders / of wethers and fat hogs
And they of the'cyte / feed birds / and great dogs
Now Juge Amyntas / which of these seems the
Of most advantage / and most nobylyte

Amyntas. If by your labor / proceeds more richesse
And most auau^tage / as seems truth doubteles
Than this Imeruayle that the they of the cite
Have so great pleynte / and we necessyte
The cause can not I / call to my remembrance
Whereof proceeds / their store and habundaunce

Faustus. The cause I told the / what would thou have more
By fraud / and flashode / have they so mykyll store
See thou not plainly / how they of the cite
Daily dysceyueth / our poor symplycyte
With that cruelte / against us they rage
By falls oppressyon / or fair feigned langage
They think it pleasoure / that sorrow on them hap
By glosed words / to take us in trappe
The most of them all / count it an alms deed
Us herdes to fraud / this is a gentle mede
For them we labor / in here / wind / cold and rain
And fraud and bysceyte / the pay us for our pain
With minds and tongue / they stody and they muse
Both day and night / us herdes to abuse
Their wit and body / all hole do they ply
For us poor wretches / to stody polecy
And after their fraud / gyle and decepcyon
Than do they laughe us / unto derysyon

Amyntas. How came thou to knowledge / of this enormyte
And of these manners / of them of the cite
My self there wonned / and there was couuersaunt
Of some of these things / yet am Jygnoraunt

Faustus. Thou could not perceive well / their enormyte
Parchau^ce thy manners / did with their life agree
There seldom is seen / great contradyccyon
Where men accords in dysposycyon
No fault with moryans / is black dysformyte
Because all the sort / like of their favor be
So couthe thou not se / their vices nor them blame
Because thy own life / was fyled with the same
But how I know them / now shall I tell to the
While I brought butter / to sell to the Cite
And other vytayle / I used milk to cry
Than had I knowledge / with an apotecary
Of him I learned / much fashode and practyse
Not to the purpose / the same to excercyse
He couthe make playsters / and new co^myxcyons
In valor scant worth / a couple of onyens
Yet sold he the same / as it were gold so dear
Namely / if happened / any infectyfe year
I was aquaynted / with many an hucster
With a costardemonger / and with an hostle^
This thief was crafty / poor people to be gyle
None like I suppose / within a dosen mile
Among all other / his frauds and his crimes
He sold one botell / of hey a dosen times
And in the otes / couthe he well drop a candell
Well knew he how / his gestes for to handle
And in the same In / there dwelt a pretty pryme
She couthe well flater / and gloss with him and him
And neck a mesure / her smyrkynge began her sale
She made ten shylynge / of one barell of ale
Whom she begyled / in pottes she was feign
To win them with flesh / and painted look again
And as I remember / her name was wanton besse
Who leest with her dealt / he thryued not the less
What need more process / no craft of the cite
Is but is myngled / with fraunde and subtylte
Save only the craft / of an apotycary
That is all fraud / and gylefull polecy
But all these would swear / that they were innocent
Or they totlhe cite / did first of all frequent
There learned they / thefce and fraud to exercise
And man of nature / is moved soon to vice
Some be also / which spend their patrimony
Which was to them let / by their old auncestry
On queanes / bawdes / in riot and dronkenesse
Their name defylynge / despysynge all goodness
With cost and pains / such busuly labor
Seeking for shame / and death before their hour
Say where is custom / of fornycacyon
Incest auoutry / and destoracyon
Forsynge of women / murdre and rapyne
Dyscorde and braulynge / nnd living like to swyne
Malice / envy / and all iniquyte
Do these not rain / in mids of the cite
All new abusyon / provoking men to sins
Had first beginning / among the cytezyns
Where dwell great princes / and mighty governors
Their life dyspysynge / for to have vain honors
Capytaynes / souldyours / and all like company
Which put for money / their life in ieopardy
These dwell not upon land / but haunteth the cite
Pore herdes fight not / but for necessyte
For lyberte / life / and justice to uphold
Town dwellers fight / for vain honor / and gold
We fight / our friends / and household to defend
They fight for malice / to riches to ascend
Our cause and quarrel / is to meynteyne the right
But all on self will / without reason they fight
They seek by wounds / for honor and richesse
And drive the wekest / to hardest busynes
O blind sowdyour / why set thou thy heart
For a vain stypende / again a mortal darte
By thousand peryllys / thou take thy passage
For a small Lucre / rennynge to great damage
Their sweet life they give / for a poor stypende
And often lose they both / and heaven at the end
While some contendeth / and fyghteth for his wage
His life he spends / than fare well advantage
What is more folysshe / or lyker to madness
Than to spend the life / for glory and richesse
What thing is glory / laud praysynge or fame
What honor report / or what is noble name
Forsothe naught but voice of wytles comonte
And vain opinion / subject to to vanyte
Proceste of years / reuoluynge of season
Brings all these / soon in oblyuyon
When life is faded / all these ben out of sight
Like as with the son departs the day light
They all be fools / which medleth with the sea
And other wise might live / in their own country
He is but a fool / which runs to tempest
And might live on land / in suerte and in rest
He is but a fool / which has of good plenty
And it dysdayneth / to use and occupy
And he which lives / in care and wretchydnes
His heir to promote / to lands and richesse
Is most fool of all / to spare in mysery
With good and lands / his heir to magnyfy
And he which leueth / that thing for to be done
Unto his daughter / executour or sone
Which he himself / might in his life fulfill
He is but a fool / and has but little skyll
But all these sorts / within the cite be
They want of wisdom / and sue enormyte
And also the youth / in days festyuall
Do naught but follow / their lusts bestyall
The weke they use them / in worldly business
The sunday serves / to follow vycyousnes
What time the shoppes / be closed all and shyt
Than is the market / with Thays / Beale / and Kyt
On highest days / such ware in namely sold
For naught it waxes / if it be ones old
Npon the sunday / when men should god honor
Left is good labor / ensued is error
Oftyme the old friar / that wonned in grenewyche
Again such folyes / was boldly wont to preche
He said where baudes / and their abusyone
Were wont to abide / in one vile place alone
Now are they sprencled / and sparcled abroad
Like wise as ships / be docked in a rode
That hard is to know / good women from the ill
By ill example / good are in doubt to spyll
Bawdes be suffered / so where they list to bide
That the street fades / upon the water side
Cate / Jyll mably / Phylys / and feat Jeny
Because of the cite / now can not get one penny
Uyle Thays was wont / in angles for to be
Now has she power / in all the hole cite

Amyntas. Thou pasest mesure / Faustus by god a vow
Thou say of malice / right well perceive I now
Myty gate thy mind / and tongue for it is shame
Men of the cite / thus largely to blame
What man is fautles / remember the vylage
Now men vplondysshe / on holy days rage
Naught can them tame / they be a beastly sort
In sweet and labor / having most chief comfort
On the holy day / as soon as morn is past
When all men rests / while all the day does last
They drink / they banquet / they revel and they Jet
They lepe / they dance / despysynge ease and rest
If they ones here / a bagpype or a drone
Anon to the elm / or oak be they gone
There use they to dau^ce / to gainbaud / and to rage
Such is the custom / and use of the vyllage
When the ground rests / from take plough and wheles
Tha^ must they it trouble / with burden of their heles
To Baccus they banquet / no feast is festyuall
They chyde and the chat / they vary and they brall
They tail and they route / they revel and they cry
Laughing / and lepynge / and making cups dry

Faustus. What stynt thou thy that / these words I defy
It is to a vylayne / rebuke and vylanye
Such rural solace / so plainly for to blame
Thy words sounds / to thy rebuke and shame

Amyntas. Not so friend Faustus / I spoke it but in game
Again to the cite / return in gooddes name

Faustus. Yet of the cite / mo soles tell can I
Which wene to nombre / the sterres of the sky
By them supposing / each desteny to tell
But all be fools / that with this matter mell
Yet be they madder / which fyxeth their intent
To search the nature / of god omnypotent
And dare be so bold / to set their mortal sight
On incomprehensyble / and pure immortal light
Our faith is better / for they of the cite
Believe by reason / with great dyffyculte
Or they will believe / they brawle with argument
Plain speech suffyseth / us people innocent
Again sir Sampson / their quarrel they defend
We ask no questyon / and use not to contend
We light the alters / and many candels offer
When they of the town / skantly make a proffer
Their faith is feeble / our faith is sure and stable
They dare be bold / with doctors for to babble
A worldly march aunt / naught knowing of doctrine
Because of his coin / counts his reason fine
Trust me Amyntas / no force who hereth me
The coin and conning / does not always agree
For some be that have / great pleynte of that one
Which of that other / have little part or none
What should the foles / that dwell in the cite
Or we seek to know / of gods pryuyte
If it were needful / the god^ed for to know
To simple wretches^here on the ground allow
It is in power / of god omnypotent
His very presence / to us to represent
But seth his knowledge / is comprehensyble
Why seeks fools / for things unpossyble
And seth god will be / unknown unto us
Why should thine mortal / of endeles thing dyscus
And ruy all people / in almys does excel
Above all the sort / which in the cite dwell
We give woll and chese / our wives coin and eggs
When freres flater / and pryse their propre legs
For a score of pynnes / and nedles two or three
A gentell cluner / two cheses had of me
Phylys gave coin / because he did her charm
Ever sith that time / less has she felt of harm
Yet is in the cite / a nombre incurable
Pleders / and brokers / a foul and shamefast rabble
Merchants of Justyce / hunters of riches
Cratchers of coin / delayers of process
Prolongynge causes / and making wrong of right
And right of plain wrong / opp^ssyng law with might
Jaylers of Justyce / their cursed couetyse
Watreth the plants / of cruelte and vice

Amyntas. This have I proved / by plain experyence
But tell me Fastus / what causes this offense

Faustus. The rote and the ground / of this mysgouernaunce
Is favor reward / and wylfull ygnoraunce
When coin or favor / ones dymmeth has the sight
Adieu all Justyce / in prison laid is right
Yet be in towns / a rabble fraudelent
Murdrers of people / and fre of ponysshement
Uauntynge and bostynge / themself of medycyne
And naught perceynynge / of seyence and doctrine
If they be fetred / with rings and with cheynes
Than may they handle / and touch pryuy veins
Name all dyseases / and sores at their will
Avoid of conning / of reason other skyll
Such ride on mules / and pages by their side
But if they had right / on asses should they ride
As touching rulers / of all the comonte
The more that they have of hye auctoryte
Of lyberte will / and synguler pleasure
So much the more / poor people they devour
The hounds sometime / wont foldes for to keep
Be now wild wolves / devouring all the sheep
Rulers be robbers / and pyllers be pastors
Gone is the guydynge / of godly governors
O where be rulers / meynteyners of Justyce
Where be s^^duers / and ^lakers of all vice
Where be the friends / of mercy and pity
Sometime well rulynge / not spoylynge of the cite
Where be chaste rulers / just meke and lyberall
Changed is fortune / death has devoured all
The worste remains / gone ben the meke and Just
Instead of virtue / rules frewyll / and lust
Where be the fathers / right worthy an empire
Of whom men counted / gaye talys by the fire
Sometime with talys / and otherwhyle with song
So dryuynge a way / the winter nyghtes long
Alas Amyntas / naught bydeth that is good
No not my cokers / my tabert / nor my hood
All is consumed / all spent and worn be
So is all goodness / and welthe of the cite
The temples pylled / does bytterly complain
Poor people wayleth / and call for help in vain
Poor wydous sorrow / and children fatherles
In vain bewayleth / when wolves them oppress
Syn has no scourge / and virtue no reward
Who loves wysoome / his fortune is but hard
Counceyll and cunning / now tombles in the dust
But what is the cause / law turned is to lust
Lust stands instead of law / and of Justyce
Whereby good living / subdued is by vice

Amyntas. I tell the Faustus / this hastynes of the
Passes the bonds / of right and honest
All men thou blamest / by wroth and hastynesse
As all cytezyns / were full of vycyousnesse
What man remember / some live in innocence
Some in the Cite / be partles of offense

Faustus. I am not angry / I say but veryte
Here me Amyntas / one clause with breuyte
As many todes / as bredeth in Irelonde
As many Grypes / as bredeth in England
As many Cockowes / as sing in January
And nyghtyngales / as sing in February
And as many whalys / as swymmeth in the fen
So many ben there / in cytes of good men

Amyntas. A good man is geason / not easy to be found
On land or in cite / or over all the ground
Many things long / unto a parfyte man
Ask that of Codrus / declare the truth he began
Badnes increases / and over fast does grow
Goodness and virtue / in coming up ben slow

Faustus. Thou art mad I trow / so many foes have we
As dwell cytezyns / in all the hole cite
They clyp us / they poll us / they pyll us to the skyn
And what they may get / y^ think they well to wy^
To theft they constrayne us / I tell the by all Halows
And after by and by / they send us to the Galows
Therefore it is reason / if ought of theyrs hap
Or come to our claws / it pryuely to trap
They us often dysceyue / dysceyue we them again
Deuyse we slyly / gyle subtle and train
But this Amyntas / to me is gretest grefe
And doubt for it is ill / stelynge from a thief
If it be secret / we may it well deny
If it be known / excuse it craftily
Preue felony / though it be used long
Is not called theft / but injury and wrong
All that they have / within these towns plain
Is our hard labor / sore travail and great pain

Amyntas. Now thou excedest / the mark of equity
Thou passest reason / Faustus I tell to the

Faustus. What than Amyntas / have pacyence a while
Town dwellers vices / does all the worle defyle
The air is corrupt / by their enormyte
These somer storms / whence come they tell thou me
Lyghtnynge / great wyndes / flodes / hayle / and thundre
I well remember / o^ttyme the ground here under
Right sore has quaked / and caused houses fall
Uyce of the cite / is rote and cause of all
The son in myddaye / oftyme has lost his light
In likewise the moon / in season of the night
Both has been black / or else reed as blood
This sign Amyntas pretends us no good
Why grow the wedes / and cokyll in the corn
Why is hay and grass / oftymes all forlorn
Why lose we our sede / our labor und expense
Where comes moryen / and grievous pestylence
All these proceeds / by mad enormyte
And corrupt manners / of them of the cite
And wors is lykely / yet afterward to fall
If they not refourme / their living bestyall
Whence came the furour / of harnes and battle
Which causes wydowes / their spouies to bewail
Which brings with it / all kind of mysery
As theft / and murdre / great death / and penury
Forsooth in cytees / this furour first began
To the confusyon / of many a doughty man
The cite is well / and ground orygynall
Both first and last / of dedely ylles all
Bredde in the cite / was cruel Lycaon
Bredde among herbs / was good Dewcalyon
Among shepeherdes / norysshed was Rennus
And also his brother / the mighty Romulus
The cause of the flode / in Cite first began
Whereby was wasted / nere every best and man
Our lord dsteroyed. v. Cytes for outrage
Read where for sins / he wasted one vyllage
I trow when the world / with fire shall wasted be
The cause shall proceed / and come of some cite
What shall I touch the savor and the stynke
Which is in cytes / of gutter and of synke
There men be choked / with vile and deedly sent
Here have we odor / of flowers redolent
I count me happy / which won in the vyllage
As undefiled / with Cytezyns outrage.

Amyntas. Have done now Faustus / lave there a straw and test
Fill we our belly / with cruddes that is best
Leave we the cite / and all Cyuyle outrage
Now it is season / to torn to the potage
After our dinner / is best as in my mind
The rest to declare / y fought remain behind.

Finis.
