Here begins a goodly treatise / and it is called / a notable lesson /
otherwise it is called the golden pystle. Impressus. Anno domini. M.CCCCC.xxx.



A Good / wholesome lesson and profitable unto al chrystianes / ascrybed unto
saint Bernarde / and put among his works [I thynke] by some good man / that
would it should thereby have the more authoryte / and the rather be read / and
better be borne away. For doubtless it is a good matter / and edificatyue unto
all them that have a zele / and cure unto soul health and desire of salvation.
It is called in the title. Notabile docume^tum. that is to say / a notable
lesson. And some done call it the golden pystle. It follows immedyately after
a little work called Formula honest vite. ye form / and manner of an honest
life / or of honest living.

IF you intend to please god / and would obtain grace to fulfill the same /
two things ben unto you very necessary. The first. You must withdraw your
mind from all worldly and tra^sytory things / in such manner / as though you
cared not wheder any such things were in this world / or no. The secunde is.
That you give and apply your self so wholly to god / and have your self in
such a wait / that you never do / say / ne think / yt you know / suppose /
or believe should offend or dysplease god / for by this mean / you may sonest
and most redely obtain / and win his favor and grace. In all things esteem
and acount your self most vile / and most simple / and as very naught in
respect / and regard of virtue / and think / suppose / and believe that all
persons ben good / and better than you be / for so shall you much please our
lord. What so ever you se / or seem to perecyue / in any person / or yet here
of any chrystyane / take you none occasion therein / but rather ascrybe / and
apply you all unto the best / and think or suppose / all is done or said for
a good intent / or purpose / though it seem contrary. For man's suspicions and
light judgments ben soon / and lightly deceived / or begyled. Dysplease no
person wyllyngly. Ne ever speak evil of any person / though it were never so
true yt you say. For it is not lawful to show in confession ye vice / or
defaute of any person / except you might otherwise show and declare your own
offense. Speak little or naught unto your propre / and self laud / or praise
/ though it were true / and unto your famylyer fellow / or feythfull friend.
But study to keep secret / and pryuey your virtue / rather than your vice. Yet
were it a cruel deed for any persons to defame them self. Be more glad to
give your ear / and herynge unto the praise / rather tha^ unto the dysprayse
of any person. And ever byware as well of herynge / as speaking of detraccyon.
And when you speak / take good deliberacion / and have few words / and let
those be true / and good: sadly set and wisely ordered. If any words be spoken
unto you of vice / or vanyte (as soon as you may) break of / and leave ye talk
/ or co^munycacion. And ever return / and apply your self unto some appointed
good / and godly occupacyon / bodyly / or ghostly. If any soden chance fall or
hap unto you / or unto any of youres / leyne not to lightly there unto / ne
care much therefore. If it be of prosperity / rejoice not much therein / ne be
over glad thereof. If it be aduersite / be not ouercast / or overthrown therwt
/ ne brought to sorrow / or sadness / thank god of all / and set little thereby.
Repute all things transytorye: as of little price or valor. Give ever most
thought / and care unto those things / yt may profit and promote ye soul.
Fle / and avoid ye persons / and places of much speech / for better is to
keep scyle^ce / than to speak. Keep ye times and places of scile^ce precysely /
so yt you speak not without reasonable and unfeigned cause. The times of scile^ce
in religion be^ these. From collacion unto mass be ended after ye hour of
terce. From ye first grace i^ ye fraytour / unto ye end of ye later grace. And
from ye begy^nynge of eue^ long / unto grace be ended after souper / or else
En^dicite / after ye common bouer. The places of scile^ce / ben: ye church
and ye claustre / ye fraytour and ye dortour. If you ye sclau^dred / and done
take occasyon at ye fault / or offense of any person / than look well upon
your self / wheder you be in the same defaute sumtyme your self / and than
have compassion upon your brother / or sister. If there be none such defaut in
you / thy^ke verily / and believe / there may be / and tha^ do: as done soon
fade / and fle for ever. The good persons / for their troubles suffered here
upon earth: done get and wy^ne eterne and everlasting glory / which the
evil persons done lose. And contrary these evil / and sinful persons / for
their joy and pleasures here / done reyue by exchange eterne and everlasting
shame / and rebuke with pain / and woe vnspecable. When so ever tha^ you ben
dysposed to slugyshnes / or to be drowsy / remysse in prayer / or dull in
devotion: tha^ take this little work / or some other good treaty / and read
therein / and ever note well the contents thereof / and what is meant thereby. And
if you be not thereby delivered or eased thereof / than shyfte unto some other
work / or occupacyon / so yt ever you avoid ydlenes / and al vain pastymes /
which in deed ben lose time. And than remember that those that now bide in
pain / other in hell / or yet in purgagory for such times so passed / or lost
/ had lever tha^ all ye world / have such time to redeem their peynes by / as
you may have if you will. Time tha^ unto al persons well ocupied / is very
precious / and dear. Byware well therefore: how you spend it / or pass it. For
you can never revoke it / nor call it bakke. If the time pass you by trouble /
and vexacyon / think they ben happy / and gracyous that been past this wretched
life / and now in blys / for they shall never have any such miserye. And when
you feel a conforde or consolacyon spyrytuall / thank god thereof / and think
the dampened souls shall never have any such pleasure. And thus let this be
for your exercise in the datyue. At night when you go rest / first make a
count with your self / and remember how you have spend / or passed yt day and
time / yt was given you to be used in virtue / and how you have bystowed your
thoughts / your words / and your works. And if you find no great thing
amys / give the whole laud and praise unto our lord god. And if you perceive
contrary / that you have mysspende any part thereof / be sorry therefore / and
byseche our lord of mercy / and forgyuenesse / and promise and verily purpose
to make amends the next day. And if you have portunyte there upon / it shall be
full conuenyent for you to be confessed on the next morrow. And specially if
ye matter done / said / or thought by deliberate consent / do grievously wey /
and work with a grudge in your conscye^ce: than would I advise you never to ete
nor drink / till you be dyscharged thereof / if you may co^uenyently get a
ghostly father. Now for a conclusyon of this work / put before you / as by
case or ymaginacyon. ij. large cytyes / one full of trouble / turmoyle / and
myserye / and let that be hell. The other cite full of joy / gladness /
conforte / and pleasure / and let that be heaven. Look well on them both / for
in both be many dwellers / and great compeny. Then cast and think within your
self what thing here might so please you that you should choose ye wors cite /
or what thing should dysplease you on the other part / whereby you should
withdraw your self from that virtue that might co^uaye and bring you unto
the other cite. And when you have studied well here upon / and can nothing
find / I dare well assure you if you keep well the precepts and cou^seyles of
this little lesson / you shall find the right way / for the holy ghost will
instruct / and teache you where you be not suffycyent of your self / so you
endeuoyre and give dylyge^ce / to bear away and to follow that here is taught.
Read it every weke ones / or twyse / or oftener if you will. And where you
profit / give thanks / laud / and praise unto our lord god / and most
sweet savior Jesus christ / who send you his mercy and grace / that always
lives god. In secula seculorum. Amen.

This was brought unto me in english of an old translacyon rugh / and rude /
and required to amend it. I thought less labor to write new the whole / and
I have done unto the sentence not very nere the letter / and in diverse places
added some things following upon the same to make the matter more sentencyous /
and full. I byseche you take all unto the best / and pray for the old
wretched brother of Syon Rychatde Whytforde.
