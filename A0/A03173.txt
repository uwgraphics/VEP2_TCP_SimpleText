The end of this table.
Of amendment. i.
IF every man mende one, all shall be mended.
This mean to amendment, is now intended.
For though no man look to mend him self brother:
Yet each man lokth to control and mend other.
VVaggyng of beardes. ii.
It is merry in hal when beardes wagge al.
Husband for this, these words to mind I call:
This is meant by men, in their merry catyng:
Not to wag their beardes in brawlyug and threatyng.
Wife, the meaning hereof, differth no two pyns
Between waggyng of men's beardes and women's chyns.
Of Have. iii.
The hasty man wants never woo.
In hastye women not ever so.
With suffryng husbands hasty wives,
Have often we see, full merry lives.
Breakyng of square. iiii.
An ynche breakth no square: which syns thou have hard tell,
Thou do assay how to break square by an el.
Otherwise.
An inche breakth no square: thou breakst none, though it do.
Thou rather bryngst square the^ breakst square between too.
Lokynge and leaping. v.
Look ere thou leap, nay thou can in no wise brook.
To look ere thou leap, for thou leapst ere thou look.
VVeddyng and hangyng. vi.
Weddyng and hangyng, are desteny I see.
Weddyng or hangyng, which is best, six (quod she?)
Forsooth good wife, hanging I think best (quod he)
So help me god, good husband, so thinks me.
Oh how like lambs, man and wife here agree.
Of Delay. vii.
He that will not when he may,
When he would he shall have nay.
But to that nay, nay I say:
If of my wife I delay,
To take shroude words: yet that stay
Stayth them not from me next day.
Of VVyttes. viii.
So many heads, so many wits, nay nay.
We see many heads, and no wits some day.
No lack in love. ix.
In love is no lack, true I dare be borowe.
In love is never lack, of joy or sorrow.
Otherwise.
In love is no lack, no in no woyng day.
But after weddyng day, lets here what ye say.
Of Homely home. x.
Home is homely, yea and to homely some time.
Where wives footestoles, to their husbands heads clyme.
Gyuyng and taking. xi.

Of the end of a vvyt. xiii.
Thou art at thy wyts end, which I wonder in
To se a wit at end before it begin.
Of bought vvyt. xiiii.

Thy wit is dear bought, and yet stark naught.
Otherwise.
Wit is never good till it be bought Will.
Jack, to bye or sell that ware, foles can no skyll.
Of haste and waste. xv.
Haste makes waste: which perceived by sloth,
Sloth will make no haste, he swerth by his troth.
Making of malte. xvi.
Soft fire makes sweet malte, as malt makers tell:
Then to make sweet malte, fire is to rash in hell.
Whereby syns in hell no good ale is to sell,
Dry drunken souls can not like in hell to dwell.
Of an akynge eye. xvii.
Better eye out, then always ache:
In rage of ache, true as I spoke:
But in mean ache, meanly to moan,
Better an akyng eye then none.
What thing beggars choose. xviii.
Beggars should be no choosers, but yet they will:
Who can bring a beggar from choice to beg still?
Of Robbyng. xix.
Rob Peter and pay Poule, thou say I do:
But thou robst and poulst Peter and Poule to.
Of need and law. xx.
Need has no law, in some case in very deed,
Need has no law: and yet of law we have need.
Of beginning and endyng. xxi.
Of a hard beginning, comth a good endyng:
Truth, on this term is not always dependyng.
Some hardely begin, by the feet to sit fast:
That end with hard hangyng, by the necks at last.
Of Grace. xxii.
In space comth grace, I grant grace may come in space:
But in rule, by thy rule never look for grace.
Of fore provision. xxiii.
Who so that knew what would be dear,
Should need be merchant but one year.
But thou have konwen years, two or three:
That good condycyons would in the

To warn the of good fore prouysyon,
Thou have not now one good condycyon.

Of good manner as it were, and more and more,
Each horse gave back, to set his better before.

As rashely, as rudely, chopped forth: and in fine.
Without any curtsy, ere any man byds:
Blyndly and boldly, he lepte into the myds.
