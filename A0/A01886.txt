Unto this Island and great Plutoes Court,
none are denied that willingly resort,
Charon over Phlegeton will set on shore,
and Cerberus will guard you to the door:

upon your senses soon will make a rape.
They that come freely to this house of sin,
in Hell as freely may have entrance in*
HOLLANDS LEAGVER: OR, AN HISTORICAL DISCOVRSE OF THE Life and Actions of Dona
Britanica Hollandia the Arch-Mistris of the wicked women of EVTOPIA.

Wherein is detected the notorious Sin of Panderisme, and the Execrable Life
of the luxurious Impudent.

LONDON, Printed by A. M. for Richard Barnes. 1632.

HOLLANDS LEAGVER: OR, AN HISTORICAL Discourse of the Life and Actions, of Dona
Britanica Hollandia, the Arch-Mistris of the wicked Women of Eutopia.
THis History, Tale, or tell-troth, (take it in which sense you please) is
dedicated to the World, whither all discourses wander, to the reformation of
vice, which is Good men's wishes, and to the advancement of virtue, which is the
aim of all honest affections so that making my sum just with mine account, I
doubt not but I shall discharge my self, of that which I owe to posterity, to
the ruin of sin, and the immortal safe-guarde of piety.

But you will tell me, to detect sin is to teach sin, the discovery of vice
like Hydras heads, does rather increase then decrease the vicious, for virtue
is seldom found to spring from Lacedemonian Tables, and chastity much less
from Aretines pictures; that wicked persons, and wicked actions, should rather
be damned in obscurity, then preserved for eternity, that it is a sin
against piety, to give wickedness any life of memory, for so the villain
became lost that set fire on Diana's Temple, and Manlius was forgot in Rome,
that did injury to Rome: wicked names dishonor fair report, and if by
compulsion the pen must glance upon them, they ought ever to be accompanied
with curses, and execrations; unrepentant sin is the Devils Godsonne, and
when we talk of capital wickedness, we ought to give it no other name but
devil; Yet Brutus and his confederates are not forgot in Liuie; Sinon lives in
Virgil, and Pandarus in Homer, we have a Layis memorable in Corinth, a Lamia in
Athens, and a Lestrigon in great Britain, why should we then loose this
Eutopian Legend of Britanica Hollandia, who exceeds all in insolence, instructs
all in impudence, and runs through a World of damnable actions, with
improuidence; no, as she is without parallel in her profession, so I will strive
to delineate her to the life, that she may ever live hateful to all after
succession.

In the Kingdom of Eutopia, nere the fair city of Maugsun, some few Leagues
distant, their lived a Gentleman of indifferent Fortunes, neither so high that
ambition did assail him, nor so low that contempt might follow him, but
Anchoring in a smooth low tide, and a safe harbor, made himself content only
with things necessary; he married a wife suitable to his estate, and agreeable
with his affections, for she had comeliness enough to content an honest eye;
cleanlines sufficient for a chaste bed, or a frugall Table, and discretion at
will to govern and dispose all things committed to her Steward-shippe; These
had issue one daughter whom they named Britanica Hollandia, Hollandia her birth.
by reason of some near allyances betwixt them and the Neather-lands. A maid
in the time of her innocence, and ignorance, so accomplished and accomodated
with all the ornaments of Nature and education, that she far surpassed all
those of her rank, and might without the offense of modesty challenge
equality with those which were accounted excellent; for she had a fair Eye,
full of strong inchauntment; a modest cheek, rich with bashfulnesse; and a
face so generally clothed with beauty, and blushes, that there was an infinite
promise of much ensuing virtue: her stature was but low, yet composed with such
true Cymetrie, and so agreeable with every other lineament through the whole
Fabric of her body, that had Appelles beheld her, he would have forsworn his
Idol to have made her his goddess; but to leave off all further circumstance,
let it suffice me to say she was truly handsome, exceeding hopeful, and had
not the Devil been too ambitious, she might have bin most happy, but where
the house is cleanest, there Satan desires to entersoonest; and if the guard
of Grace be Idle or vnwatchfull, repentance may follow, but it cannot prevent
surprizall, and so it fares with this Creature, for as heaven had bestowed upon
her all outward imbelishments to attract virtue unto* her, so had some sinister
power, or the corruption of her own flesh married to those bodily beauties,
such a wicked spirit, that all goodness became to her an utter stranger* she
was of such a proud, haughty, and disdainful nature, so Masculine in her
disposition, and so mad to encounter any cross to her best loved cogitations,
that like the Spider, which turns all things to poison which it tastes, so
she became an utter Athiest, and would acknowledge no God but her own pleasure;
She had from men's praises, women's envies, and her glasses plain-dealing, her
parents tenderness, her friends carefulnes, and her companions amazedness,
got such a true knowledge of her handsomnesse, that she did not only believe
it, and love it, but mightily doated upon it; neither did this foolishness of
selfe-affection so bind her to the admiration of her own beauty, as a proud
and furious conceire of the excellency of her wit, (above the sphere of other
women's capacities) did bind and slave her to embrace to her self this
conclusion that she only was excellent

Now she begins to grow in hate with her fathers house, the Country is
unpleasant, uninhabitable, obscure and durtie, that house-wifely employments,
were slavish engagements; to live with parents, was but to lie with bondage,
that al comman dements were curses, and obedience only a figure of simplicity,
and ignorance; she would often say within her self, what is beauty, if not
seen, what seen, if not admired, what admired, if not desired, and what any,
or all if not enjoyed; and where shall these be gathered from the blossoms of
trees, heaps of stones the ouerflowes of fountains, or the dull rabble of
Clownes and heards-men? No, it is the City that is the sphere of beauty, there
are her Temples, there live her votaries, and there burns her sacrifice, the
Country is but a rotten chest that conceales holy relics, let me live in the
City, where if I cannot outshine all, or at least equal all, yet a tworst I
shall be hid in an handsome Cabinet.

Upon these, and the like resolutions she throws her-selfe into a deep
melancholy: all meats are but course for her diet, she forsakes them; sleep
is too near a kinseman to death, she hates it; all company seems rude, she
loathes it; all discourses are vnpollish't, her ear will not receive them; and
to conclude, as an exanimated carcass, she walks with no soul, and but half
a motion.

Her parents quickly perceive this alteration, and like noble Physicians labor
to find out the cause to make the cure more easy, more speedy, more certain;
but she that had a locked up soul in a fort impregnable, what through disdain,
the handmaid of Pride, and Pride it self the Lord of stubborn resolution, she
became so impenitrable, that sooner might they bring the Poles together, then
separate her from one tittle of her private resolution, so that finding her
fixed, they leave to molest her, only observe all occasions, and all
circumstances, every passage, and every Action, that might give any light to
those designs on which she labored with such difficulty; in the end,
finding her set one day in a private Room, without any companion, but solitude
and her own thoughts, her Father stealing within the distance of her speeches,
might hear her utter these words. O life, which have deceived so many,
seduced so many, blinded so many, thou art nothing at thy beginning, thy light
is nothing but a shadow, thou art but smoke at thy height, thou art sweet to
fools, thou art bitter to the wise, who loves thee, knows thee not, who
knows thee, contemnes thee; and here with a deep sigh she made a full
period, when her father pressing upon her, demanded the cause of this quarrel
betwixt her and life, urging her with much ingratitude, to condemn that, from
which her self had received so much luster, applying her beauty, her youth,
her wit, and all her inward, and outward faculties, as vnrefellible arguments
of infinite beholdingness to life, who had brought them into the World, and
made them beloved of the World; but she with a silent bashfulnesse (fuller of
deceit then innocence) forbearing to reply gave him occasion to assail her
with all the strength that nature, love, and a fathers authority could collect
together, and did so urge her to display, and lay open the Cabinet of her
dearest counsels, that she either unwilling to loose so fair an opportunity,
or to apparel her envious grief in the robes of obedience, with a seeming
unwilling willingness, did disburden her heart of that load of grief, which
so long had afflicted her: yet not without many disguises, and false habits, as
not being weary of the Country for it is solitude, but careful to discharge
him of much cost, and encumbrance; that the City was more hopeful for her
advancement, because the two columbes of posterity, honorable Marriage, and
wealthy employment had there a settled residence, and threw away their favors
blindfold, like the children of Fortune.

There did need small debatement, Her coming to the City.
When both the parties did agree upon one proposition, for he seemed to outrun
her in willingness, and as if their thoughts had been cast in one mould, an
equal diligence made preparation for her speedy departure, the mothers consent
was not wanting, so that all drawing by one link without hinderance, strife or
advantage, the work was in a trice effected, the daughter was brought to the
City, and settled in an honest Magnificos service.

Here, after the expense of some small time, living as it were in a Burse of
resort, where men and their minds were continually trucking for new
commodities, it was impossible for this rich Jewel, which was without foil;
because it knew no Art, and without fraud by reason of an innocent ignorance,
should either stand gaping for a chap-man, or like an idle prentise, with his
hands hid in his cap, cry, Sir, what lack you; No, vnsullied beauty like the
Sun will give light to a whole Hemyspheare* and this damsel had so shot her
beams through every corner of the City, that her Suitors were like Coriscas
smockes, infinite in number, many in good opinion, and but one at one time in
employment, yet with such severity she governed her passions, that the
strictest eye of modesty could hardly detect her government, and she was the
rather induced to this Austerity, by beholding the pictures of two famous
Curtezans, which did hang in her Masters Gallery; the first, which was less
fair, but more fortunate, had this inscription, Si non Cast tamen Caute, the
other which was far beyond all for beauty, and inferior to none for Misery,
had written over her. Nec cast, Nec caute; on these two plain songs her
resolution made sundry descants, but the close of every strain was, That to
sin wisely, was to sin safely, that after-thoughts were foolish, and had I
wist childish; hence it came that amongst the vn-numbred number of her Suitors,
she chose one whom she knevv honest, Her marriage.
by all men's report, frugall in her own experience, industrious in his
affairs, and painful in every circumstance of his profession, one that was
handsome enough to love, and stout enough to control, yet such an Idolater to
her beauty, and such a slave to her commandments, that neither his eyes, nor
ears could carry credit beyond her sufferance; of this man she made a husband,
and had not the devil and woman's weakness conspired to make ship vvracke of
her virtue, they might have lived and dyed with fair reputation; but now
she shakes hands with bashfulnes, and fear, and the manliness of her
courage, Her falling from virtue.
meeting with the liberty of a bold wives rudenes, she dare both entice and
lend an ear to inticements. It Is true, that love in her friends, made them
call impudence an high spirit, and losenesse a pleasant behavior, but those
which had been brought up in the same school where she learnt her
complement, knew that the gate was wide enough, and the way plain enough which
lead to the ruin of her virtue.

Many assault were given to this fair Fort, Her subtlety.
but some she with-stood, to gain an opinion of goodness, and they were great
ones; some she durst not entertain for fear of after repentance, and they
were loose ones, some she held at a distance to draw on benefit, and they were
the rich ones, and some she scorned, and they were fools, Fiddlers, or base
ones: But behold, at last, the devil himself fearing to lose so rich a prize,
which he knew would not come to his kingdom alone with her own lading, but
with the spoils, and triumphs of a world of unfortunate creatures of both
sexes, he sent to assail her one Ignatius a Puritan Jesuit; The first that
made her a whore.
a fellow, whom Lucifer had so instructed, and adorned with all the deceiuable
qualities and inchauntments of a seeming goodness, that virtue herself could
hardly have discovered him, without the use of her diuinest spectacles; he had
all the amiablenesses of a good face, and a well-shap'd body, which he made more
glorious with gravity and good clothes, he had an excellent wit, prompt and
ready, which he witnessed in his discourses, being full of delight and
learning, he was full of Bounty, and liberality; a world of poor deceived
people (especially women) maintaining his exchequor, and when the fire of lust
was kindled in him by the devils bellows, he was so full of delicate
Petulance, and inchaunting dallyance, that a cold half buried Anchorite would
have engendered a flame from his embers.

This great General for Hell (not alone in this, but in a world of other
damnable actions) com's with his Legions of enchantments to besiege this
Redoute, or weak Sconce, even at the time when there was a mutynie raised
betwixt her and her best soldiers; for indeed, Modesty was in disgrace, and
accused for a Coward, Chastity was scorned as a shadow and no substance,
Bashfulnesse was reputed weak and childish, Honor a Chimera, Good-fame a
dream; and indeed, all the Virtues stood cashired as enemies unto Pleasure; so
that there was left none to withstand him but Frailty, a Cannon-law, and a
Penal Statute.

Against these he raised such a battery of sweet discourse, and enchanting
persuasions, that she stood amazed, and staggering at the first onset, till
fear of the Law, and a little love to good report, stepped betwixt her and the
enemy, and beat him back with these, or the like arguments. First, that her
Reputation (not God or his Judgments) were so dear and tender unto her, that
she durst not give ear to his sorceries: but he with a smile (wherein a good
eye might have discerned scorn) asked her what Reputation was; She told him it
was the very Manna, and Nepenthe of generous Spirits, the Goddess of great
courages, and the triumph of all Noble Actions; she said it was a thing so
delicate, so pure, and so unspotted, that the least excess did blemish it, any
unjust action dishonor it, indiscretion, negligence or Idleness deface it,
but Prostitution that did wholly ruin it; it is a constant friend that will
follow and go with any good action, but if once forsaken, no inquisition, no
search, no prayers, or tears, can ever again find it: Believe it Sir, (said
she) there is no such misery as to outlive Reputation, nor any follies like
that which puts it in hazard. But he, to whom Blasphemy was familiar, and
Atheistical propositions more frequent, then holy sentences, had soon brought
her to a Nonplus; so that forsaking her guardians, she was content to hearken
to composition. This capitulation assuring him of future conquest, he now began
to sing his own triumph; and to make his conditions more glorious, the
assurance of her affections more serious, and his laciuious pleasures, of a
long lived indurance, he began to discourse unto her the lives and Legends,
(but not the deaths and disasters) of diverse famous and renowned Courtezans;
The tale of Lol^ca Paulina.
but especially above all the rest, and as a History best agreeing, and
paralelling with her own Fortunes, as also seeking to cover his own luxurious
wickedness, and the wickedness of his own coat and calling, under a greater
man's wantonness, he insisted most upon the life and fortunes of Lollea
Paulina, the greatest Courtezan, the basest Whore, and the deceitfullest Bawd,
that ever Rome did acknowledge; But here you must understand, that this subtle
Enginer, played but the flattering Historian, for he only touched at her
felicities, but either forgot, or leapt over her infinite miseries; he showed
how she was borne in the City of Fano in Italy, Rome.
of good, but poor parentage: how after her Fathers death, necessitty brought
her to seek shelter, being accompanied with nothing but a divine beauty, an
unmatchable personage, a boundless wit, and an infinite spirit.

Here Hipolito the great Cardinal of Est, and brother to the Duke of Ferara,
beholding her, grew enamored on her, bought her at an infinite price, and
maintained her above the rank of the greatest Princes: Insomuch that at an
enterview of Ambassadors, before the Pope, in Mount Angelo (being by
torchlight) she came amongst the Ladies so covered, and onercouered with
Dyamonds, and the richest Iewelry, that excepting her face, (which the Sun it
self was not able to darken) there could nothing be discerned but a moving
flame of most glorious fire; and those which had skill did value her at more
then a Million.

It is not to be expressed with what greedines of spirit, and earnest delight,
Britanica's ears drunk in this Story, for she was infinitely covetous; not as
Misers to cram her chests, but as a discreet Prodigal to fill her pockets,
placing her delight in giving, and spending, Riot, Revels, Plays, Feasts, and
all manner of wastful delights, were to her such dear companions, that rather
then loose them, she would lay both life and soul in pawn for their ransom;
nay, she was such a true admirer of pleasure, that albe she knew there was no
true pleasure upon earth, and that only Grief Went up and down, covered in
pleasures outside, yet was her soul so ravished with delight, that she became
dead flesh, and would not feel vexation as long as her eyes stood fixed on
Pleasures garments.

This Ignatius saw, this he knew, and finding her Spirits take fire at his
words, he again pursued his Story, and showed her how Paulina having nothing
but the revenue of Luster, a little beauty, was three times the richest, the
greatest and the most respected Lady of all Rome; and here he paul'd, for had
he followed the truth of the Story, it would have showed him that she was three
times also the poorest, the most dejected and basest, miserable, despised
creature that Rome, or the world had ever reserved for memory: nay, so
exceeding hateful was her condition, and so infinite her contempt, that she
gave her body in prostitution to the common hangman, for one meal to sustain
her; and in the end dyed without pity, and was buried without Ceremony, had
he amplified any thing upon this Text, he had marred his own market, and made a
Conuertite: But they were vvhites beyond his Aim; confusion was only within
the reach of his Arrow, and that he hit, for his words did so well please
her, and his rich promises so assure her, that freely she gave him her body in
possession; and he inioyed her for some short space, with out competitor.

But Lust is a Gangrene, Her multiplicity of prostitutions.
and having once poisoned a member, never leaves spreading till the whole body
be confounded, she has now broken one link in the golden chain of Chastity,
and she cares not though all the rest be molten with confusion; hence it com's
that she entertaines more devils, variety is pleasant, one ship yelds small
custom, great Nauies fill large Treasures, and her revenues came in with such
full Tides, that false Pleasure made her believe there would never come ebbing.

In this unchaste Progress, she took an essay or taste of all degrees, all
professions, and all conditions, from the Noble, to the Gentile, from the Camp
to the City, her ears had heard al languages, her purse had received all
Coins, and had not her fortune bin more favorable then her affections, her
body had bin confounded with all manner of putrifactions.

But in the end, She determines to turn Bawd
looking back into her self, and beholding into what a crasie and rotten Bark
she had shipped her self, on a rough and tempestuous Sea, where infinite diseases
lay gaping upon her, the terror of the laws ready to devour her, shame and
beggerie striving to overtake her, and lastly the curse of all curses, to make
her last will on a dunghill, or at the best in a Spittle, this did so perplexe
her, that being cloyd with saciety, and sin as weary of her, as she was weary
of sinning, she began to turn over the leaf of her wickedness, and though
she had no thought of amendment, yet she will take a new course for the safety
of her health and person.

She will no more be a Layis, but a Lena, no more a bewitching Whore, but a
deceiving Bawd, the Sins of others shall maintain her Sin, she will no
more trust her-selfe on the Surges, but will traffic by Factours, and
according to the wealth of her Wares, so shall be the increase or decrease of her
Revenues.

She had no sooner settled her self in this resolution, and sealed it before
Hell and her own evil Conscience, but presently she puts it in execution, and
that she might frame all accomodations suitable to her deseigne; she looks
forth for a better house, for her own wanted elbow room, she must have many
Meanders, and many passages, many holes, and many hides, deeds of darkness
do ever require many dark corners.

At last she lights upon an old ruined Castle newly repaired, so commodiously
placed both for her homebred customers and Foreign visitants, as well for the
Hawke, or Buzzard, that Hyes by day, as the Owl, or Bat, that flutters in the
night, that her heart could not wish a place of better convenience; The Sea on
one side did bear against the walls, and both tall Ships, Flyeboates, and
Pinnaces, might there Anchor in a safe Harbor; on the other side, it had some
slight intrenchments, which albe they were but weak and assayleable, yet the
Sea upon all assaults, did grant her both Munition, victual, and avoydance. And
that a good Name might patronize her many evil actions, she caused it to be
called by a good old Dukes Title. As we say Dukes place Duke Humfrey, or the
like.


Of this house by contract, she got possession, and her purse being well
filled, and wide open, emptied it self to give it adorment, there wanted
nothing for State, nothing for Magnificence, nothing for Delight, nothing for
Beauty, nothing for Necessity, howsoever the bones that lodged in it were
rotten and unwholesome, yet the Monument it self was wondrous Gaudie, and
hansome; there was nothing now for her to search for, but living furniture, and
that she divided into three stations.

The first, A Bawdes furniture
a stout Ruffian to guard her, the second, lusty strong Queans, to supply
offices, and the third, petulant painted, and half guilt Mimicks, to give
entertainment; The first of these she saved from the Gallows, the second she
hired from the Stews, and the last, she had bought up by whole sale from the
Country: there needed not much search, sin is found in every corner, and these
creatures like troublesome watermen plying a rich fare, will thrust themselves
into the devils arms beyond hope, With whom she trades.
beyond redemption.

There was not a Carrier that had a cracked piece, but she had coin to exchange
it, there was not a Poulterer, that brought up a young or tender pullet, but it
was bought for her diet, she had charms to entice the simple, money to bewitch
the needy, rich clothes to adorn proud spirits, ease for Idleness, pleasure
for wantens, and indeed any thing, or all things to keep her Commonwealth
from falling.

Being thus accommodated, and her Mart proclaimed, there was no doubt of
customers, every man has a penny for a new Tavern, and every Letcher has a
Dollor for a renowned Brothell, and then this, there was none so famous; and
her visitants came flocking so fast for entertainment, that her Kitchen was
like Aetna, ever flaming, her Hall was like Augeus stable, ever stinking with
broken meat, and Mary-bones, her dining-roome, was like Babell, a mixture of
nothing but confused noyses, and her inward and private Lodgings, like Hell it
self, where wicked creatures lay bathing themselves in Lust, as the damned
souls do in Sulphur, thus she continued her riot for a long season, boasting
her-selfe in the strength of her wickedness, and not grieuing for any thing
more, then that she could be no more wicked.

But there are Judgments Registered above, Her sins calling in question.
and shame and disgraces preserved below, and when either the one, or the
other falls, Woe to the offender; Judgment may forbear, and Justice may
sleep, but neither will pardon, it is only to raise the Arm higher, that the
Thunder may fall with greater fury; And now the noise of these offenses have
awakened Authority and that joining with piety, both send forth their Ministers
to apprehend her; At first she plays the Rebel, and withstands their Summons,
but finding her self at last inuyroned on all sides, and that neither Sea, nor
Land, affoorded her safety, how-euer unwilling, yet with a seeming
willingness, she yielded up her-selfe and her retinue, into the hands of
Mercy; From thence they were brought to the bar of Justice, where her
Ruffian was perpetually condemned to labor at the Hempe-beetle; A place like
our houses of correction.
The rest whom she had seduced, A place like Bridewell.
were sent for ever to the house of Repentant Strumpets, only her self, who
was the chief author and framer of all this Iniquity, A place, like Newgate.
she was sent to the loath some dungeon of Capitol offenders, there to remain
till her cause were heard, and due punishment put in execution.

All this as it was decreed, Her carriage in prison.
so it was performed, and each one went to their several place of sadness,
but Britanica, who although she range in a superlatiue way of wickedness, yet
did she not want friends, neither was she without her daily visitants, for
there is a correspondencie amongst the worst, and wicked ones are said ever to
hold together. She had Counsels of all manner of creatures, Quirks to avoid
Statutes, Quillets to defraud Judgments, and Demurres to protract and put off
the days of her Trial; She wanted no Suitors to plead for compassion, no
advocate to blanch her offenses, and make her black sins white ones, there
did need no tears, she commanded more Crocodils then Nilus, and for bribes,
her Coffers were full, and she was willing to unload them: But all these and a
World of others, being bound up together in a Bundle, and put in the scale
against her intolerable mischiefs, were so light and invaluable, that but
despair and disgrace she could find no comforters; Finding her self thus hard
beset, she now begins to call unto her the strength of a woman's wit, and
concludes in her self, that as the Serpent deceived the first woman with his
flattery, so he may (for amends) give her some relief with his subtilty, and
indeed her cause was so foul, that there was no hope but in stratagem, and to
that course she only now bends her study, and in this sort she effects it.

Some few days before her trial, Her escap^ from prison.
there came to visit her a Gentleman of very grave and portly carriage, one
that had in his looks and behavior, both reverence and Authority, he salutes
her by the name of Niece, and she with low humility, and a river of well coind
tears, blushing that she could not blush faster, returns his Salutations,
with the name of an Uncle, she casts down her countenance as ashamed to look
upon him, he gives her comfort, but so mixed with severe and bitter counsel,
that the standers by might perceive he came neither to flatter nor deiect her;
these complements finished, they fell to private discourses; those ended,
according to the custom of those places, and the use of such visitants, he
calls for Beer, for Ale, for Wine, and a World of other Iunkets, there is no
spare of cost, his gold flies, the Keeper carouses, his servants supply things
wanting, and no man near them, but has busy employment.

After this conflict ended, and the Gentleman preparing for his departure, he
bestowed upon the Keeper, a Ring of pretty value, upon his servants Gold, and
on the poorer sort of prisoners a Bountiful Larges, descending down the
stairs he offers to take his leave of his Niece, but she will attend him as
far as the limits of the house will give her sufferance, and so she brings
him down to the lowest hall, then offering to leave him, he told the Keeper
how sorry he was to depart with dry lips, and calling to mind a Tavern
that stood at the next door, he woes the Keeper there, by all means, to take
another Pottle.

The Keeper is willing to attend him, and why (quoth the Gentleman) may not my
Niece take share with us? for mine own part, I know not her Trespass,
therefore I dare not urge unlawful favor. Sir, (quoth the Keeper) her offense
is neither Felony, nor Treason, she is neither liable to B^nd, nor Execution,
and therefore my self will be her Guardian, and she shall wait upon you;
and so together they go all three to the Tavern; the Uncle calls for Pottle
upon Pottle, the Niece fills bowl upon bowl, and the Keeper drinks them up
as if his thirst could never be quenched; In the midst of these quaffings, the
Keeper and the Uncle, fall into a discourse of such seriousness, that they
neglected all things but their own speeches; Britanica taking advantage at
this Oblivion, rises from the Table, and as if the Wine had stird in her some
Office of secret occasion, steals out of doors, and knowing that at the very
entrance of the back door, stood a Monastery of Gray Friars, looking back,
and seeing her Argus more and more inchaunted with Mercury, like light
Salmacis having her heels at liberty, away she runs, and finding the door of
the Monastery open, like a poor affrighted Dove, shot from the Talents of
an eager Faulcon, In she enters for safety; to the first Brother she meets,
she falls upon her knees, and having taught her eyes to weep at her own
pleasure, she delivers him so pitiful a story of her misfortune, that h^d he
bin as cold as his profession, yet it would have moved in him a Flame of
infinite Compassion, he takes her up, and being, as all his Order are,
faithful and helpefull to women's afflictions, he promises her all relief,
all safety, which done, he conueies her through the dark corners, and
intricate passages of their cloister, whether he showed her his own Cell or
no, it is uncertain; But it is an apparent truth, that he never forsook her,
till he had placed her in that safety, which her self desired.

By this time her Uncle and the Keeper having tired themselves with needless
complements, began to give their tongues a little ease, that their eyes might
with more liberty look about them.

The Uncle perceiving that his work was effected, faynes occasion of hasty
departure. The Keeper supposing his prisoner had been with the Mistress of the
house, conducteth him to the door, and there shakes hands till their next
meeting; then calling for his Charge, he fi^des that she is utterly missing; it
is vain to trouble your ears with the Keepers amazement, his fury, his
fretting, and his inquisition, let it suffice she is gone; her escape is
known, the Monastery stands upon Privilege, and had the Keeper all the
charms of Medea, or Circes, they were too weak to open one boult in those
places.

Britanica being thus escaped, and by the help of her Confessor, brought to
the place of her own safety, she there lies hid like the Minataure in the
Laborinth, yet howeuer her body lay concealed, her mind was full of Action, and
busy molestation, and now she sets all her Emmets, and laboring acquaintance
on work to sue, if not for a pardon, yet at least for some fair composition;
and having the experience of former occasions, she knew there was no way so
safe or speedy as that of Bribes, therefore like a prodigal she casts away her
wealth, and would not suffer any man to be employed for her, but his pockets
were filled with gold by her; In the end her Project proved prosperous, and upon
strong Security of a new life to come, and a true Repentance for Crimes past,
her peace was made, but yet at so dear and high prized conditions, that
looking into that infinite wealth, of which but little before she stood
possessed, she now found her self scarce able to subsist or to bestow one good
Meal upon her Belly.

There was not a Curse, Her miseri^^.
an affliction, a Plague, or what else is more bitter, that ever was foretold,
or predestinate to a Strampet, but she had her share thereof in a downe-pressed
and ouerflowing measure; she saw her kindred loathe her, Friends forsake her,
her Companions mock her, her Slaves command her, and which is an Hell above
all other, none but her enemies to pity her.

These afflictions, A new falling.
every one thought to be Adamants, powerful enough to draw her Soul to
heavenly Meditations; But the effect proved quite conry, for she ever carried
the Devils Balm in her Bosom, and could anoint over every disaster of
Fortune, with, what will be shall be; She had got this Adage, in her mouth,
Things past cure, past care, and whether it were Envy, or Fury, or both, she
became so desperate, that she cared not to trust her self in the Seas, on a
hurdle.

After some small time thus spent in languishment, looking at no mark, but the
old one, (for she could with the least trouble hit it) she labors all her
Spirits, all her Imaginations, puts her Friends, Flatterers, and Companions, to
the Test, leaves no way or means unassayed, how she might advance and set up
again her old occupation; she has framed to her self, new laws of seuerer
condition, she will have Taxes of a higher, and more profitable Nature, she
will have Riot clothed in Frugalities shadow, her Wine, though more in
Measure, yet shall be drunk in less Glases; her Music shall speak sharply,
and sweetly, but not loud; her Wench^s shall be fair and handsome, yet but few
in number; for when Supplies are wanting, she knows how to fetch them from
places of fair Reputation; her Ordinary servants, shall be comely and
industrious, and when extremity comes upon her, she will have disguises to
make them appear half Angels; In brief, her old Commonwealth shall be
turned topsieturvie, and this new one, made so strong and permanent, that it
shall be to all the Impudent creatures of the earth, an everlasting president.

Upon these Resolutions, she thought her work was half finished, till
looking better into her design, she found the Base and groundwork whereon
she was to build the foundation of her proceedings, was yet to find out, and
utterly beyond both her reach and compass, and that was a convenient house;
she will no more trust Old Ruins, or Religious Neighbors, the one will endure
no Battery, the other will abide no Badde dealing; She will have a house of
Strength, a Fort, a Bulwark, a place so impregnable, that when all shall be
vanquished, it shall stand in defiance; and that she might attain such a
safety, she ranges through every part, and promising place of the City, but
all in vain, those buildings are so linkt one to another, that all are to be
surprised; She then survayes the Suburbs, but finds none to content her; at
last she betakes her self to the Sea, and makes a discovery upon the water,
there she finds many Rocks, many Islands, to which, Nature had lent much
Strength, but Art must be employed, and that was too costly; half tired with
her search, and thinking to return, she is informed of a place fit for her
purpose, Like the Banck side.
being wondrous commodiously planted for all accomodations; it was out of the
City, yet in the view of the City, only divided by a delicate River, there
was many handsome buildings, and many hearty neighbors, yet at the first
foundation, it was renowned for nothing so much as for the memory of that
famous Amazon, Longa Margarita, who had there for many years kept a famous
infamous house of open Hospitality.

She no sooner heard this report but presently turning her Sails, she made
for that coast, where she found such abundance of Natural and Arteficiall
intrenchments, that ever the house seemed to be in it self a little City.

Here she enquires, what strong hold, The site of her house
or Fort, was to be let for yearly Revenue, and presently she was brought to
a Fort, Citadell, or Mansion House, so fortified, and invyroned with all manner
of Fortifications, that had Impregnable Rhodes taken thence it is pattern,
neither the Turks wealth, nor the Traitors wit could ever have betrayed it,
for e're any Foe could approach this, he must march more then a Musket Shot,
on a narrow Bank, (where three could not go on Breast) betwixt two dangerous
ditches; then enter a Port, bulwarked on every side, and cross immured both
before and behind, with deep ditches, a Drawbridge, and sundry Pallysadoes,
then another passage, in all points like the former, Sluced with ditches, and
Baracadoed with strong Rampires.

Then another ditch of of much larger continent then any before spoke of, which
ran like a circumference, and girded in it is Arms all the whole Mansion,
then a World of other Bulwarks, Rivers; Ditches, Trenches, and Outworkes,
which hemmed in the Orchards, Gardens, Base-courts, and Inferior Offices,
making every one capable of a several fight, and every fight able for many
hours to play with an Army; when she had taken a full survay of this
Forcel^t, and seen how commodious and fit it was for her purpose, she then
inquires what other benefits were appertaining unto it, as Neighborhood,
pleasant walks, Concourse of Strangers, and things of like Nature, in all which
she received a full satisfaction; especially, and above all the rest, she was
most taken with the report of three famous Amphytheators, which stood so near
situated, that her eye might take view of them from her lowest Turret, one was
the Continent of the World, because half the year a World of Beauties, and
brave Spirits resorted unto it; the other was a building of excellent Hope, and
though wild beasts and Gladiators, did most possess it, yet the Gallants that
came to behold those combats, though they were of a mixed Society, yet were many
Noble worthies amongst them; the last which stood, and as it were shak'd hands
with this Fortress, being in times past, as famous as any of the other, was
now fallen to decay, and like a dying Swanne, hanging down her head, seemed to
sing her own dierge; With these reports, Dona Hollandia was ravished beyond
measure, so that fearing to loose the instant opportunity without further
debatement, she presently stroke up the Bargain, possession is given, the
Keys delivered, and when she please she may enter.

After these proceedings, Her new preparations.
she returned home to prepare Men, and Munition for defense, Wenches for use,
and victual for mainteinance, as for household Ornaments, those she intended
to increase, according to the strength of her Coffers. Her desires were so
great, that her haste in the execution could not be little, she will not
loose a minute, but (according to the old saying) running from post to pillar,
and making Hay in the Sunshine, she fore-slowes no occasion, till she have
all things fit for her new work; which obtained, she imbarkes her self, and
makes for her wished harbor, where in a little space of time she landed with
one Ruffian, whose name was Cerberus, and rightly, for he was monstrous both in
shape and condition, and to him she gave charge of the gate, the Drawbridge,
and Percullis, she had four wantons, the first Beta Breslonia, a huge
Bona-Roba, one impudent above measure, and insolent beyond comparison; the next
Eliza Caunce, for by chance her father got her, by chance he forsook her, by
chance she turned Whore, and by chance this Bawd light upon her, she was young,
little* but a wondrous wanton, she had a white skin and a well shapt foot, only
her hair was Corral, but covered with a white Periwig, the third was Longa
Maria, a wench of a good handsome carriage, not so Rampant as the rest, not so
rude in behavior, but being seasoned with better education, she could boast of
some parts, for she had a good voice, and could touch the Vyoll; the last was
Maria Petit, a small handful of woman, yet pleasant and witty she was all
Motion, and Action, nothing was more irksome to her then sleep and silence,
for by her will she would be ever dancing, or singing; She had three household
Officers, a Cooke-wench, a Laundrey-lasse, and a Girl Scullian.

Being thus landed with this Luggage, she presently placed every one in their
true equipage, gave them their several charges, read them the Laws, and
Ordinances of the house, Proclaiming a strickt penalty for the breach of every
condition; this done, she hangs forth her Flagge for custom, Proclaims her
preparations, and invites all the world to a general entertainment.

Did you ever see Eagles prey on dead carcasses, Crows feed upon carrion, or
hungry dogs devouring filthy intrailes, in double that abundance, came
creatures of all qualities to be undone by her, only the empty purse was
expulsed, and could get no admittance, nay a reasonable stock many times
perished in the midway, and could not get to the end of his purpose, her Taxes
and customs were so many, and so mighty: for Cerberus at the first port had a
double impost, one for the gate, another for the Drawbridge, the household
officers had Fees for the Hall, for the dining-roome, and the withdrawing
chamber, the rest which were peculiar to the Bawd her self, report has
affirmed they are sans number: thus every day came some tall Ships, some
Fly-boats, some Caruils, and some Frigots, wealthily laden, but at their
return, they had not so much as Ballast, but came forth poor and empty.

All her entertainments had a Protean condition, full of variety and changes,
and she would ever suite them to the nature of him that was entertained; if
he were of worth and respect, he was respectively used, if otherwise, besides
the expense of his coin, his clothes were forfaited for his rude behavior,
and diverse have bin seen to return from thence, both day and night half
naked.

These mil-dewes could not choose but breed her an infinite world of honey, Her
new wealth
and true it is, that her baggs were so many, and so m^ssy, that she had scarce
chests enowe to contain them, this wealth made her proud, and pride taught her
to be curious, she will not live at so low a rate as she has done, but as she
has plenty of means, so she will have plenty of attendants, and hereupon
presently she contracts and hyres sundry retayners; as first, a Surgeon that
took care of her Spittle, then a Tyre-woman of Fantastical Ornaments, a
Sempster for Ruffes, Cuffes, Smocks, and wastcoates, and a Tailor for clothes,
of all shapes, and all fashions, and these have confessed their livings only to
come from her Coffers.

But this Sunshine must not be without some clouds, The cause of new uproar.
for now the crew of those Queanes whom she has cast off, and consumed, the
accusations of those whom she had robbed, and reviled, and the detestable
enormities which spring from such wicked examples, come all with one voice
before the throne of Justice, appealing for satisfaction; The plaint is
received, approved and pitied, and presently potentes sent out for her
apprehension, and the razing down of her Castle

A corporal is forthwith chosen, She is besieged.
and a stout band of Halberders and Bil-men, A Corporal in war is a Constable
of peace.
sent to beleaguer this fortres; she stands upon her guard, hangs out a Hagge
of defiance, and bids them enter at their peril; They which had a double Armor
a good cause, and lawful authority, scorning to be out-braued, prepare for an
assault, she on the other side with her man devil, and her she furies, stand
to receive them, and to make her triumph more glorious, she sets open the gate,
puts down the Bridge, and draws up her Percullis, the enemy bravely enters,
and coming on in good order, they were no sooner on the Bridge, and had filled
it from one end to the other, but by a secret device which she concealed,
down fell the Bridge, and the Corporal and his soldiers were half drowned
in the water; where, to see how they lay plunged in mud and mire, how one to
help another, became worse and worse encumbered, but above all, to hear her
scoffs, her Whores taunts, and her dogs reuilings, and recount them, would
make a Tracte double this volume, to tell the difficulty of their escape, their
tedious and durty passage to safety* what shame they felt in themselves, and
what mocks they received from others, would be pleasant to fools, but in wise
men it would stir up anger.

The Corporal complains of this defeat, The continuance of the Leaguer.
but yet still continues the Leaguer, when presently a Provost is sent with new
supplies to assist him, A Provost is called Provost Marshall.
but she is as careless of him, as of the other, draws him into as great
dangers, and derides him past sufferance, past measure, daily new forces come
to their aid, but all in vain, they dare not assault her, she is held half
immortal, and it is thought of her enemies, (that were they surviuing) she was
able to encounter with Bradamant, Marphysa, and Clardana; To conclude, they
dare no more assault her, but with a continual Leaguer, mean to tire her out,
or famish her, how things will proceed, is uncertain, only it is supposed,
that if this Leaguer last not so long as Troy, yet it will far exceed Ostende
in continuance, and so in this martial business, I must leave her, concluding
her to be the most famous that ever the Sun did look upon, in her most damned
profession, and that she may write Annals, and Comentaries to teach Rome,
Venice, Florence, and the Turks Seralia; for us here in great Britain, we
neither either read, heard, or bred a creature of her temper, our clime is too
cold, our instructions too severe, and our punishments too sharp and piercing,
let Hollandia then live still in Eutopia, and as it was worthy to give her
breath so let it write her Epitaph,

FINIS.
