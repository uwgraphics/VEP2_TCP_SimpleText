An earnest persuasion unto the Pastors of Christ's Church, whersoeuer they
be dispersed, but especially unto his Church of England: That as they have
thruste the Plough share into the ground, so zelously and watchfully to walk
forth right, not leanyng to the left hand, neither tournyng to the right. For
who so lays hold of the plough and looks back, is not apt for the
kingdom of heaven.

To the christian Reader.
LEt no man that shall read, or hear this read, or any thing within this
book contained, think or imagine the writer hereof is persuaded, or goes
about to persuade, by any word, within this book, that it were meet or
conuenience, for any Preacher or Minister, to appoinct unto himself, either
cappe or other garmente: but that they are all bound by the duty of their
alleagance, to wear and do, all such orders as the Prince shall appoinct
them, to imitate and follow: or else with saint Peter, by the word of God, to
confuce the same, as neither lawful nor necessary. And not by their evil
example, suffer the truth to be shadowed and darckened, the forward fathers
to be by the Papists, condemned as rash and unadvised doers. But either to
prove them so, or else to defend their quarrel, and be content to bow their
sholders to the bearyng of the cross, the which who so refuse to do shall be
found loyterers, and not true laborers. To whom these few words are
dedicated and directed, I trust none other thing then by the sincere truth,
may be sufficiently supported and defended. I desire you not to esteem this
to be dooen of arrogancy, neither to have any ill meaning, but only to crave
at your hands; some short pitthie work to satisfy all men. For a great
number of the laite will in no wise now go back to their old lessons, [beyng
now further and much better enstructed] then to defile them selves with the
giltines of this crime: to the condempnyng of all those reverend fathers,
which have followed the Apostles; in the purity of perfect religion,
received from the primative church. But desire rather to step forward
still, until it shall please God to banishe al supersticion clean out of this
church, which he sone bring to pass for his Christ's sake. Amen, AMEN.

The voice of GOD unto his Church.
WRapped in woeful wise,
with doleful dolours deep:
In sobbing sighs and trillyng tears
half wakyng half a sleep.
Methought I heard the voice,
of God which thus did say:
Unto his pastors of this church,
Awake it is clear day.
You may not slumber now,
nor walk as in the night:
Ye must do the work of the day,
which now shines fair and bright.
(Why) have ye hardened hearts,
let them be molified:
Why will you wafte and waver stilt,
stand fast and do not slide.
Beware thou waver not,
and wafte with every wind:
Step forward still and stagger not,
be not led by the blind.
If thou have stepte a wrie,
to starte back is no shame:
If in the plain pathe thou did walk,
walk forth right in the same.
Let not the worldly pomp,
be unto you a yoke:
Cleanse all your grounds and suffer not,
the thorns my wheat to choke,
( Fabius Maximus,
that valiant wise captain:
Whose noble acts, the Romans old,
in great renoume retain,
Being offered the Croune,
refusyng (it) he said,
Much more honor then happiness,
unto the croune is teide,
He said) who knew the charge,
and eke the cares most great,
Would not vouchesafe to take it up,
findyng it in the streate.
Much less honor to hold,
whereby he should stand bound:
Not (only) his own conscience,
but others to confound.
My Prophets all are such,
as will in no wise like:
That ye should wander in by ways,
as one that wear to seek.
When ye did first profess,
to favor mine estate:
you vowed then with fervent heart,
my laws to celebrate.
And when your wanton toys,
wherein you took solace:
Had caused me to cast you of,
and turn from you my face.
When for your just deserts,
I seemed to set you light:
Suffryng your fooes, to spread the fields,
with banners of despite.
And when your Godly guides,
for your dealings unjust:
Were trodden down defaced eke:
and some consumed to duste.
Then could you call and cry.
then could you make great moan:
Then if I would become your friend,
you would (serve) me alone.
Then all adulterous ways,
ye would detest and hate:
Promise you made (not to pollute)
my house in any rate.
You said you would be seen,
in no wanton attire:
But that you would reformed be,
as I should best require.
But all to sone I see,
you have forgotte this gear:
You are become wild Calves again,
you are not as ye wear.
If for obedience,
you seem to turn that way:
And are content to please men's minds,
and my will disobeye.
In this you have done ill,
thus to famishe my flock:
To feed those bealie Gods that of,
you make a laughyng stock,
I would that you should not,
offend my little ones:
Nor dandlyng thus your dissemblers,
dashe mine against the stones.
(Oh) why do ye devise,
to make my ways more darcke:
And force my flock to slip backwarde,
when they would hit the mark.
My little cilie Lambs,
whom ye should feed and cherishe:
By bryngyng in this gear again,
they are now like to perish.
What your conscience will do,
that they do most abhor:
And ye condemn my true preachers,
as though they ran to far.
Whereby you do aduouche,
the Papists which do say:
Some run to slow, and some to swift,
in them there is no stay.
But walk ye forward still,
and I will them persuade:
They can not win the garlande so,
except they deeper wade.
Such are ne whot ne cold,
like them they would you wear:
But of their filthy cup drink not,
it is to bitter gear.
Thou shall commit no ill,
that good may hap thereby:
And yet thou art become so blind,
thou see not thy folly.
But turn to me thine ear,
and listen to my lore:
No new found toye I will thee tell,
but that has been before.
Some little ones I have,
that so far for the are grown:
That suffer will most grievous pains,
to have mine honor known.
Your ways are not my ways,
your thoughts are not like mine:
Not you but I work my one works,
yet not as you define.
In some despised ones,
my honor for the I spredde:
For they are of my chosen church,
whereof I am the bed.
Not all the worldly wise,
but some such as appear:
Most simple to the wicked world,
those are my children dear.
You must talk frankly now,
it is no time to flatter:
We may not here look for great sheanes.
but rake in those that scatter.
The harvest is nere done,
but yet the stubble is stout:
Wherein lies hid many good ears,
which ye must now glein out.
You must dispatche in have,
that all were in my Barn:
Haruess is done, Winter draws nere,
say that I you do warn.
Mine Angel cries out,
unto the Harvest manne:
Thrust in thy Title on the earth,
prepare the Flaile and Fan^e*
For now throughout the earth,
their grain is ripe out right:
The flower must forthewith be cleansed.
and all chafe blown out quite.
Spurn not against the prick,
my work finishe I will:
The dotyng age of this old world,
would lie and loyter still.
It is no time to gape*
or gase for pollecie^*
For what I have determined*
that shall be done quickly,
Wherefore my Harvest men,
set to your Sithes with speed:
For those that I find loyteryng now,
I will cast out as weed.
Think not your swift cuttyng,
shall cause one grain to fall:
For I have counted every ear,
not one corn perish shall.
You may set forth your selves,
and seem to further me:
Trusting your wisdoms more then mine
but so it would not be.
You might do your good wills,
and trust me with the rest:
You might do what I you command,
and not what you think best.
As times there are to speak,
and times to be silent:
In season and out of season,
in my works be fervent.
What good servant think ye,
in this case could be slack:
That for one foot forewardes would now,
seem to step two foot back^.
Not talkers but walkers,
in my harvest are meet:
Not respecters but directers,
of my rites are most feet.
Not daundlers but handlers,
of my word without cloak:
Not such as fear, but as will bear,
my joyful cross and yoke.
Now note what ye have seen,
in my steps and that do:
But do not seem to help my works,
by addyng yours thereto.
For what have I to do,
with you, or your advice;
In their due times I do all things,
to purpose most propice.
I know there is no prince,
that takes my word in hand:
But will hear you and be content,
to have the truth well stand.
But to the merciful,
if you fear truth to tell:
What would you then to tyrauntes do,
that are both fearce and fell.
When Daniell in den,
lay destitute of aid:
How came Abacucke into him,
how were the Lions stayed.
For Jonas in the sea,
who did provide the Whale:
And preaching unto Niniue,
who did prefer his tale.
What hope had Abraham:
when he did imolate:
At my request his son Isaac,
how stood then his estate.
And what was Jacobs hope,
seruyng his sier Laban:
You know well how his case did stand,
and how I help him than.
Of Joseph in Egipte,
and of his father old*
What I wrought for them in that land*
long tales might here be told*
The Papists look to have,
miracles at your hand*
What miracles might you have wrought
in this realm of England.
The Lions mo^thes you might,
have stayed and stopped fast*
The blind and lame restored to (...),
and made your foes aghast.
Why did you not as I,
example did show here:
What Paul received, that he gave,
his plainness d^ app^re.
But now you know my mind.
let this fault be amended:
And scorn not at this short warnyng.
for ye have sore offended.
I know all flesh is frail,
and very prone to fall:
To starte back when you step ^misse,
it is no shame at all.
I se how loath you were,
to do that you have done:
And eke how sore you do lament,
that ever it begone.
Be not slack to confess,
nor slow to turn again.
Since you do know my will, do it:
let me not preach in vain.
As ended were these words:
me thooght the planettes seven,
Did lose their light and streams of blood,
tell forthwith down from heaven.
Whereby the earth enfecte,
grievous plagues did ensue:
What I have heard and seen ye know,
Gods peace be now with you.
I tell you what I heard,
and eke what I have seen:
The Angels of almighty God,
defend our noble Queen.
Whose mighty majesty,
preserve her grace from smarte.
And power his spirit plentifully,
into her noble heart.
He grant her his good will,
that she as willyngly:
May him embrace, and bend^ her heart,
to banishe all Popery.
The ever (being) God,
grant this as I have prayed:
Amen, Amen of each good heart,
so be it now be said.
FINIS.
