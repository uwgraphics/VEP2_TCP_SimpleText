A BRIEF INFORMATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE PALATINATE.
The affairs of the PALATINATE, consist in four principal heads.
Concerning the first head.
FOR this many ages past the Realm of Boheme has been always holden both
within and without the Empire for elective and not hereditarie. The Letters
Reuersalls of all the Kings of Bohemia which have successively been, even to
the Emperor Ferdinand the second, have a clear and express recognition and
confession that they have, and possess it not by any hereditary right, but by
the free election, good will, and consent of the estates of the said Realm,
according to the Golden Bull, their liberties and privileges. There has not
been any but only the Emperor Ferdinand the second, who has challenged a
partension of a succession hereditary, the which he foundeth principally upon
a certain disposition of the King Vladislaus his great Grandfather by his
Mothers side, made on the sixth day of January 1510. in regard of the Duchess
Anne his daughter, who was afterward the wife of the Emperor Ferdinand the
first; the Copy whereof ensues word for word.

Vladislaus by the grace of God, King of Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatio,
etc. Marquess of Morauia, Duke of Lucemburg and of Silesia, Marquess of
Lusatia, etc. Be it known to all men by these presents, since that God by his
divine grace has given us heirs both sons and daughters, and that by his
divine providence, as also by the advice and counsel of our Subicots,
Prelates, Princes, Lords, and all the estates of our Realms, we have first
caused the most excellent Prince, King Jews our most beloved son, to be
crowned King of Hungary, who afterward by the free will of the Barrons, Nobles,
and Towns of the Kingdom of Boheme, has been crowned and received in the
same Realm. But if it shall happen that the said King Jews dye without heirs
(which God forbid) then the Duchess Anne our daughter shall remain, and be
true heir of the Realm of Boheme land, by power and virtue of the rights,
constitutions, and privileges of the Realm of Boheme. And we having had
regard unto that, and considering the singular affection, devotion, and
promptitude, that our Subjects of both our Realms show unto us; we think and
judge it to be right and equitable to provide for them in such sort, that for
the necessities of the affairs of these two Crowns and Realms, they may
treat and negotiate in their own mother tongues, with our heirs and their
future Lords. And for that cause we have ordained, and do ordain, that our
heirs have to make their abode in a place fit and conuenable, to the end that
the subjects of the Crown of Hungary, as well as they of the Crown of
Bohemia, and those of the Crown of Bohemia, as well as they of the Crown of
Hungary, may enjoy and have their presence, and may have access unto them.
They shall be also bound and obliged to entertain near unto them an equal
number of men and women, Natives of the Kingdom of Bohemia and Hungary, to
the purpose that they may learn the Languages of Hungary and of Bohemia
freely, and without impeachment. And that the Estates of every one of the same
Crowns may sufficiently and at large confer with them in their own
Languages, touching their necessities. Moreover, we promise unto them of the
Realm of Bohemia, not to marry, nor to promise in marriage the Duchess Anne,
our daughter, without their counsel. And we promise all this which is
contained in these presents, in the word of a King, and do also promise unto
the Barons, Nobles, and all the Estates of the Realm of Bohemia, to observe it
fully and inuiolably without any co^trauention, in any fashion whatsoever. In
witness whereof, we have caused our Royal Scale to be set unto these
presents abouesaid. Yeuen in our Castle of Prage, on the Friday after the Feast
of the 3. Kings, in the year of our Lord 1510. and of our raigns, to wit, of
Hungary the 20. and of Bohemia the 39.

This disposition of the King Vladeslaus is set down by the Emperor Ferdinand
at this time, for the strongest Bese and foundation for the hereditarie right
that he claymeth unto the Crown of Bohemia, forasmuch as the Duchess Anne,
his grandmother, is called heir of the Realm of Bohemia, and that (as he
says) by virtue of other precedent agreements. Now I will not enlarge my self
here to dispute upon this Foundation (for that the Estates of Bohemia have
already refuted it very amply and solidely by their Writings, and especially
by their Book called the Deduction, which they published in the year of our
Lord, 1620.) But I would only (as by the way) show the manifest nullitie
thereof, by the contradiction that is therein.

For first it appears by the Reuersalls of the said King Vladislaus, given
unto the Estates of Bohemia on the day of his Assumption to the Crown, that he
acknowledged and confessed, that he obtained and received the said Crown, by
the pure, sranke, and free will and election of the said Estates, and not by
any right hereditarie. If then he had not any right hereditarie, much less
had he power to confer and give a right of succession hereditarie unto his
daughter.

Secondly, if in regard of his person he had had such a right of succession,
yet it had not been lawful for him to dispose thereof unto his son, for
that the Realm and Electorate of Bohemia was holden of the Empire only to the
heirs males, as the other Electorates be, and cannot fall unto the Distaffe;
Women being incapable to perform the Functions and Offices of men, required in
the Office of the Electors, by virtue of the Golden Bull.

Thirdly, the said disposition contains a most gross and palpable
absurdity, in that the King Vladislaus says in it, that his son has been
receiuea by the free choice of the Barons, Nobles, and Towns of the Realm,
and that he adds then by and by, that his daughter shall be heir of the said
Realm after his death: for if the son could not come thereto, but by the way
of free election, how can it be concluded, that the daughter have a right of
succession hereditary in a estate tail unto the heirs males, which her
brother had not? And to make this absurdly more evident, behold the Copy of
another Letter Reuersall, which Vladislaus gave unto the Estates of Bohemia,
when that they designed and accepted Duke Lewis his son for to be their
future King.

Vladislaus by the grace of God, King of Hungary and Bohemia: Be it known unto
all men whosoever that shall see or hear these presents. Forasmuch as the
Barrons, Nobles, the Towns of Prague, and the other Towns, together with the
communalty of the Realm of Bohemia, having by their free choice, and without
any obligation of theirs thereunto chosen and crowned, in our life time the
Serenissime Prince and Lord Lewis King of Hungary, as they before time have
done unto us their affection, by the said election of King Lewis our son, yet
with this charge, that as long as we shall be in life, we shall retain and
hold the government and possession of our said Realm, and the Provinces
incorporated without any impeachment of King Lewis our dearest son until our
death. That on the other part we will not fail continually to acknowledge it,
and will protect and give order, that they shall be maintained without any
trauerse or trouble in their rights, franchises, privileges, and customs, as
we have promised and do promise them by these presents, when that King Lewis
our most dear son shall come unto the age of maioritie, and after our
decease shall take possession and administration of his Realm of Bohemia, he
shall be obliged to do and accomplish all that which the Kings of Bohemia, our
predecessors, as also our selves have done and accomplished by Obligation, in
such manner and form as we have given them express Letters, signed with our
hand, and sealed with our Scale, with this reservation, That if King Jews our
dearest sonue does not accomplish all that which is contained in our said
Letters to them exhibited, in satisfying to all that unto which the Kings of
Bohemia are bound, they shall also not be bound on the other part to admit the
said King Jews in the possession and government of the Realm, and that for so
long time, and until that he has made total satisfaction, according to the
more ample purport of our said Letters: but when he has made such
satisfaction, the said Estates and they of the Provinces incorporated shall be
reciprocally obliged and bound to swear unto him loyalty, and to be faithful
unto him in all humility, as unto their crowned King.

After the death of King Jews, who was slain in the battle of Mohaz, in the
year 1526. the Archduke Ferdinand married the said Duchess Anne, and sent the
same year his Ambassadors unto the Estates of Bohemia, requiring them to
choose and receive him for their King, alleging amongst other reasons, that the
said Anne his Wife was the nearest unto the Crown: and though that the Estates
granted his request, in giving the Scepter and Crown unto him, this was not
in any sort in contemplation of the pretension of his Wife, but of their free
consent, as is most evidently seen by his Letters Reuersalls, which follow:

Nos Ferdinandus, Dei gratia Rex Bohemia, Infans Hispaniarum, Archidux Austria,
Marchio Mora^^^, Dux Lucemburgia, Silesia, and Marchio Lusa^^a, etc. Notum
faci^us tenore prasentium vniuersis. Quemadmodum Barons, Nobiles, and etiam
Civitates, ac tota Communit as Regni Bohemiae, ex sua libera and bona
voluntate, iuxta libertates Regni Elegerunt. Nos in Regeon Bohemiae. Quapropter
recognoscimus, quod hoc ipsum ab Oratoribus ipsorum abunde intelleximus, and re
ipsa cognouimus and comperimus, quod praefati status and communita^ ill^us
Regni, non ex aliquo debito, sed ita pront supra scriptum est, eam Electionem,
eligentes Nos in Regem Bohemia, exlibera et bona voluntate fecerunt. Harmn
testimonio literarum sigilli nostri, quo hactenus tanquam Archidux Austriae,
vsi sumus, appensione roboratarum. Datum in Ciuitate nostra Vienna, die tertia
decima Mensis Decembris, anno Domini millesimo quingentesimo vicesimo sexto,
Regni vero nostri anno primo.

True it is, that these Reuersalls were afterward delivered up by the Estates
of Bohemia unto King Ferdinand, at his instance, who put in the stead of them
other Reuersalls, where many things are found to be changed, against che
intention and approbation of the said Estates.

The Emperor Ferdinand the first, and the said Anne his wife had a son called
Maximilian the second, and Charles d'Austria, the Estates of Bohemia chose
Maximilian the second Emperor, who gave unto them Reuersals, like in substance
to those which his father had given, in acknowledging their free election,
without pretension of any right. After his death, they chose Rudolph the
second, Emperor, his son; and in the life time of the Emperor Rudolph, they
designed for their King the Archduke Matthias, who was also afterward Emperor.
It is fit to be noted, that the said Emperors, Maximilian, Rudolph, and
Matthias, though all descended from the said Anne, and all by right of priority
to be preferred before the said Archduke Charles and the Emperor Ferdinand the
second, his son, have at their assumption unto the Crown of Bohemia,
frankely confessed by their Reuersals not to pretend unto it any hereditarie
right, but to have recceiued it by the free Election of the Estates; and
especially the Emperor Rudolph having in his life time consented unto the
Election of Matthias his brother, gave them a very ample and large Letter of
Assecuration, dated on the Saturday after Quatuor tempora, in the year 1608,
That the said designation ought to be holden for a free and voluntary Election
and Reception, without any prejudice unto their Privileges, Rights, Statutes,
Customs, and such like things. In like manner, the Archduke Matthias made his
Reuersals, dated on the Wednesday after S. John Baptist, acknowledging and
confessing by them, repeating it often and in plain words, That it was not by
Obligation, but by a frank and free Electionand will, that the said Estates had
designed and received him for King, after the decease of the Emperor Rudolph,
his brother.

An Extract of the Reuersals of the Empereur RVDOLPH.
FOrasmuch as we, as King of Bohemia, have given our consent unto the Estates,
that at such time as the said Archduke Matthias of Austria, our eldest brother,
when he shall request them lawfully and duly, according to their privileges
and liberties, be chosen after us for heir apparent of the Realm of Bohemia,
etc.

And a little lower: We and the Archduke Matthias, our brother, when he shall
have obtained such provision, will puruey and assure the said Estates by
Reuersals sufficient for that purpose, That the same shall not bring presently
nor hereafter any prejudice or damage unto their privileges, liberties, good
and laudable customs, and vsages, etc.

And yet more low: Wherefore we for us, our heirs, and the Kings of Bohemia
that shall be hereafter, promise unto all the Barons, Nobles, Towns of Prage,
other Towns, and to all the Communaltie representing the Estates of the Crown
of Bohemia, That the said free Election of the Archduke Matthias, our most
dear brother, for to be heir apparent, and after our death King of Bohemia,
shall not apport from henceforth, at this present, nor in times to come, any
prejudice, damage, or derogation unto them, nor unto their Rights, Statutes,
Privileges, Libertries, Ordinances, Benefits, neither to all the old and other
Customs, good and laudable Vsances, especially unto the Obligations unto them
given by the King Ottocarus, by the King John, by the Emperor Charles, by the
King Vuenceslaus, by the Emperor Sigismund, by the King Albert, by the King
Ladislaus, by the King George, by the King Vladislaus, by the King George, by
the King Vladislaus, by the Emperor Ferdinand, and by the Emperor Maximilian,
our most dear Lord and Father, etc.

An extract of the Reuersals of the Archduke Mathias.
THe Estates have chosen us with one consent of their good frank will for
heir apparent, and King of Bohemia, etc. And lower:

Wherefore following our said consent, we promise for us, our heirs and
successors, unto all the Lords, Nobles, and Towns of Prague, as also unto
other Towns, and all the Communaltie, representing the Estates of the Crown
of Bohemia, That this free election of our person, etc. shall not bring nor
apport any prejudice or derogation unto their Rights, Ordinances, Privileges,
Franchises, Statutes, Benefits, nor to all their just and ancient Customs,
specially unto the Obligations to them given by the King Ottocarus, by the King
John, by the Emperor Charles, by the King Vuenceslaus, by the Emperor
Sigismund, by the King Albert, by the King Ladislaus, by the King George, by
the King Vladislaus, by the Emperor Ferdinand, our gracious Lord and Father,
and by the Emperor Rudolph, etc. And yet a little more lower:

Item, we promise, That during the life of our dearest Lord and Brother, not to
intrude our self into the guidance and government of the same Realm of
Bohemia, nor of the Duchies of Silesia, nor of the high nor of the low Lusatia,
etc. But if it shall happen, that we will draw unto us the domination and
government in the life of his Imperial Majesty, or else if we will not
perform and do (at such time that we shall come unto the Crown of Bohemia)
the same which the Imperial Majesty and the other precedent Kings of Bohemia
have done and performed touching the Oath, and all other things pertaining
thereunto; The Estates shall by no means be likewise bound unto us. Then since
that the eldest sons of the Queen Anne, and the two eldest sons of him,
have one after the other received and accepted the Crown of Bohemia, wholly
from the pure good will and free election of the Estates, and not by any
succession hereditary, there is no likelihood nor reason the present Emperor
Ferdinand, coming of the younger son of the said Queen Anne, should have
more right and pretension hereditary unto the said Crown which they never had.

To the which you may add, that after the death of the Emperor Matthias, in
the year 1619. when it was questioned to choose a new Emperor, the Elector of
Mayence, Arch-Chancellour of the Empire, called and cited the Emperor
Ferdinand (who was not yet advanced unto the dignity Imperial) unto the Diet
of Franckfort, to assist and to be present at the Election of the Emperor, as
King and Elector of Bohemia, chosen, received, anointed, and crowned by the
said Estates, as he has expressedly declared by his Apology, published and
printed against the complaints the Ambassadors of the said Estates made in
that time of such like convocation, which they said was done unto their
prejudice, for that they were then in controversy, and had lawful exceptions
against the said Ferdinand: In like manner, the other Electors received him
into the Conclaue Electorall, not in respect of any right hereditary, but only
in respect of his Election, reception and Coronation that the said Estates had
made of his person; this is that which they expressed one to the other in the
said Diet, and that all the three Ecclesiastical Electors have jointly with
the Elector of Saxony reiterated afterward in their Letters written from
Mulhausen, as well to the King Frederick as unto the same Estates, and unto
some other Princes of the Empire, for to let them to understand that the King
Frederick had not entered into a Realm void of a King, and vacant, but already
provided of another King, designed, chosen, and crowned by the said Estates: So
also they in the said reception of him into the Conclaue Electorall, had not
any regard unto succession hereditary, for otherwise they had done wrong unto
the Archduke Albert, to set behind and exclude him, for by right in that case
he ought to have been preferred before the Archduke Ferdinand now Emperor,
his Cousin, issued and coming from the second brother.

All this shows sufficiently, that the Crown of Bohemia ought to be holden
for Elective and not hereditary. As to the limitation that the Emperor
alleges thereto, as if the liberty to choose the Kings of Bohemia ought not to
be extended out of the house of Austria, as long as there be Princes of the
said house living. This is a pretension which hitherto cannot be debated and
decided by any other way, then that of fact, in the which neither reason nor
equity can have place: for although the Estates of Bohemia have chosen this
many years for their Kings some of the Archdukes of Austria (which is the
second of their grounds) it does not ensue thereof, that this continuance of
theirs does import or make a prescription of time, since that the Reuersalls of
every one of them have been as many praecautions, to stop and hinder such
pretensions, even as the Princes Electors have never yet auowed unto the said
Archdukes any succession hereditary in the Empire, though that for many years
they have in like manner chosen the Emperors out of that family.

Now it remains to touch in one word as it were by the way, the reception of
the Emperor that now is, unto the Crown of Bohemia. In the year 1616. the
Archduke Maximilian seriously represented unto the Emperor Matthias his
brother, by a memorial dated the 16. day of February, how much it imported and
concerned the house of Austria, that his Majesty should be affured in his life
time, especially of a successor in the Empire; as also in the Realms of
Hungary and Bohemia, that he could not propose a person more capable and fit,
then his Cousin Perdinand the Archduke, and that he had already treated with
his brother Albert the Archduke, for to obtain his consent, that he ought to
seek all the means he could, to dispose the Estates of Bohemia, and them of
Hungary, unto the designation of his aforesaid Cousin: that it was needful for
his Majesty to speak himself with the Elector of Saxony, to gain and
purchase his voice and suffrage in his favor; that the three Ecclesiastical
Electors were for their part inclined thereto already, and that afterward it
behooved him to call a Diet, in some convenient place, to make an ouerture of
such a succession Imperial, and to proceed with plurality of voices, though the
Elector Palatine and he of Brandemburg would not yield thereto: and for to do
this, to keep an Army afoot within the Empire, under the pretext of the war
which his said Cousin had at that time in Istria against the Venetians, and
advise him to effectuate his other purposes and determinations which had been
put in deliberation between them: but above all things, that he took great
heed that this advice was not vented and disclosed before the time. This
counsel was approved and received by the Emperor Mathias, and soon after
divulged and communicated unto the Elector of Saxony, and sundry Princes of the
Empire, but that did not impeach and hinder the effects at all, for
incontinent, some began to work the affair in Bohemia, by practices,
corruptions, and menaces, as the Estates have largely declared in their
Writings, the Archduke Ferdinand was designed King of Bohemia: the Emperor
went unto the Elector of Saxony to Dresden, and also called an assembly at
Ratisbon.

At the same instant that the Electors prepared them selves for the said
Assembly of Ratisbon, they received news that the Estates of Bohemia, driven
to impatience by so many violences and oppressions, continually and incessantly
made against them, had cast down headlong out of the window of the Council
Chamber two of the principal Officers of the Emperor, and a Secretary for
many great reasons by them deduced and published, which to be short, are, That
they were convinced by their own Letters and Writings, to have betrayed their
own Country, and served as instruments to depresse the said Estates, and to
deprive them of their Religion, liberty, felicity, and happiness.

The Emperor Mathias being offended with this procedure of the Estates, sent
his Armies into Bohemia, for to take revenge thereof, and they stood upon the
defensive, whereon ensued a pernicious war.

The Elector Palatine, after the commencement of these troubles, sent his
Ambassadors unto the Emperor, to request him to give peace unto his Realm,
whereby to prevent the ruin of that Country, and other inconveniences; but in
vain: for answer was made by some, that his Majesty in reputation could not
permit such an affront to go unpunished.

The Archduke Ferdinand, at that time defigned King of Bohemia, was resident
and abiding at the Court of the Emperor Matthias at Vienna, who for his great
debilitie and weakness meddled not much with the affairs of Estate, but all
was directed by Ferdinand.

A little while after the Emperor deceased, and the Elector of Mayheme called
an Assembly of the Electors at Francfort, for the election of another Emperor,
and called thither (as I have said) the Archduke Ferdinand, as King and Elector
of Bohemia: The Estates of Bohemia sent thither their Ambassadors also, for to
protest, and to make their exceptions against the said Archduke Ferdinand, whom
they said they could not acknowledge for King: but the Electors Ecclesiastical
would not by any means suffer them to enter into the Town, much less give
them audience, and hear their griefs; alleging, that it was a particular
business, and that by the authority of the Golden Bull, it was not lawful to
treat of any other Affair in such an Assembly, as that which concerned the
election of the Emperor: the which excuse had some fair appearance outwardly,
but if it were well and narrowly seen into, and marked, it was erroneous, in
the regard of the Estates of Bohemia; for they maintained, that the Archduke
Ferdinand ought not to be admitted unto the College of Electors; and that
therefore it was not a matter particular, but a point concerning all the
Electors, and in general all the body of the Empire.

The said Ambassadors not obtaining hearing, and Audience, returned without
doing any thing, and Ferdinand was received into the College of Electors by
the hasty promotion of the three Electors Ecclesiastical; which thing
imported the Estates of Bohemia to take the resolution to reject Ferdinand. The
Abdication was made in a solemn manner; and some few days after, the Estates
passed unto a new Election.

The causes of the said Abdication are found, and are extant, with all the
Circumstances, in the Book of the Deduction (made by the Estates) and be very
many, of the which I will recite some few as briefly and succinctly as
possibly may be: The Estates affirmed, That Ferdinand did violate his Oath, and
his Reuersalls, in that during the life of the Emperor Matthias, he intruded
himself, and meddled in the affairs of Bohemia: That he carried himself like
an enemy toward them: That he gave authority and gave order to make war
against them: That he solicited the Estates of Morauia to give passage unto
the Army of the Emperor: That he himself caused his Troops to come out of
Styria, and sent them into Bohemia: And that in their greatest necessities he
would not fauorize them with one good word toward the Emperor, though they had
requested him instantly in their often Letters so to do; but that, unto the
contrary, he has made them seele the effects of his evil will and malice in
sundry matters: That after the death of the Emperor, in stead of restoring
peace unto them, and of taking due notice of the bad comportments of the said
Officers, to do justice thereof, he has written unto them, and that by his
Letters, as by manner of approbation, and ratification of their offenses, he
has restored and put them again into their Offices and Charges, sending unto
them from time to time the confirmation of the Privileges of the said Estates,
for to receive them at their hands: which thing the said Estates could not do,
for that after so many evil offices and acts of hostility, and rigorous
demonstrations of Ferdinand, they had need of an assecuration better founded
then on a simple Writing. To all the which motives, and many others, they
adjoined the transaction Clandestine, made by Ferdinand with Fhilip the third,
King of Spain, the sixth of June, 1617. By the which it is treated, concluded,
and decreed between them, of a Succession hereditarie, and of the continuation
of the same, first in the family of Ferdinand, and afterward in the family of
the King of Spain, according to the agreements and conditions, as appears in
the said transaction more at large: Which was kept very secret, and concealed
from the Estates of Bohemia, till after the designation of Ferdinand, but it
was afterward of it self discovered by another means. And in as much, that it
takes away from the said Estates the liberty to elect, (giving unto them
Kings, by way of intrusion, without their knowledge and advice) and
overthrowing as much as it can, the Laws Fundamental, unto the observation of
the which, all the precedent and former Kings have been bound by solmne Oath;
they infer, that by the same, and by his other deeds aforesaid, Ferdinand is
made incapable of the Crown.

After this Abdication, the Estates of Bohemia founding and relying upon their
ancient Rights, Privileges, and Liberties, proceeded some few days after unto
the election of another King: and some having given their Suffrages to diverse
Princes, they chose by the most voices, and proclaimed the Elector, Frederick
the fifth, Count Palatine, for their King. This was on the 16. or 26. of the
month of August: and on the next day, being the 17. or 27. of the said month,
the Archduke Ferdinand was chosen and declared Emperor by the College of
Electors, at that time being assembled at Francfort, as is already said.

The said Estates gave notice incontinent unto the Elector Palatine (by a
person sent unto him of purpose) of this his Election, approved and ratified by
all the Estates of the Provinces incorporated, requiring and earnestly
beseeching him to accept it: which thing he did not at the first, but called
together a great part of his friends and allies, and sent Ambassadors unto
them who were further off, to have their advise; in which space of time, the
Estates redoubled their most humble instances, by their often and iteratiue
Letters, and finally, sent unto him into his own Country a solemn Embassade,
composed of the Deputies of every Province, for to present the Crown unto him,
and to dispose him to accept it, as he did.

One may then see by this veritable and irrefragable information, that the
intention of the Prince Palatine has not been to intrude, nor thrust in
himself by force, nor by practice into the Kingdom of Bohemia, much less to
thrust any other, out of that which was due or appertained unto him, but that
he friendly and without doubt belecued by the circumstances abone mentioned,
and other most pregrant reasons already set down in other places, That the
Crown unto him so solemnly offered, was totally vacant, and his Election very
lawful. Also there has not bin any other mark or but in the accepting of the
Crown, for no other cause, but to succor the oppressed, to prevent the ruin
of the Realm, and to hinder that it should not fall into the hands of a
S^ranger, unto the great disadvantage of the Empire: And for that the effects
had fallen out otherwise, we ought to remi^ the judgment unto God the director
of all things, who will dispose of them as shall seem good unto him.

Touching the second head.
FOr to understand the diference and controversy the better, it is good to
understand and know well the quality of the subject or matter, and the quality
of the persons.

The subject of the controversy, is the Realm and Electorate of Bohemia, the
which as it is said, for these many former ages to this time, has been holden
to go by Election, and though it hold in fee of the Empire, yet it does not
appertain immediately unto the Emperors no more then the Electors, as well
Sec^lars as Ecclesiastiques, and many other as well Electiues as hereditaries,
appertain not in propriety unto the Emperors, for there has been many
Emperors of Germany, that have not been Kings of Bohemia, and that the
Electors are not bound by any means to choose the King of Bohemia for Emperor.
Also, he has its private or particular laws, and is not in any thing subject
unto the constitutions of the Empire: and likewise the Archduke of Austria,
after the battle of Prague have begun to maintain publicly as well by
their pen, as by their sword, that the said Realm and Electorate does
appertain partieulerly unto their house in propriety. It also appears by the
transaction of Spain, mentioned before in the first head, that the Archduke
Ferdinand now Emperor, attributes particulerly to him and his son, not as
Emperor, but as in the quality of Archduke, in the which yet there is one
remarke very considerable; to wit, that after the ^^aking of the said
Transaction, unto the day of his designation, made by the authority of the
Estates of Bohem^, he durst never usurp the title of King, nor make any
mention unto them of any such agreements or covenant, ^nowing too well, that
for that the same was directly contrary to their privileges and rights of free
Election they would have opposed themselves, and never received him: So that
the question, if the Crown be Elective or hereditary, is not debated with the
Estates of Bohemia by the Emperor, in the quality of Emperor, but as Archduke.

Likewise one cannot say, that by the reiection of the Archduke Ferdinand, the
Estates have rejected the person of an Emperor, for that then the Empire was
vacant, and without Emperor, he coming afterward to the Imperial dignity;
yea and more, if in that same very time, the body of the Empire had from it
self offended with such a Reiection, the judgment had no^ belonged unto the
Archduke Ferdinand, but rather unto the Elector Frederick, as chief Vicar of
the Empire, representing in that time the person of the Emperor: And therefore
it follows, that the said Reiection is an act particular, which does no^
touch the person of the Emperor, nor the body or corpse of the Empire, who
never at any time meddled or had to do with the affairs between the Kings,
and the Estates of Bohemia: now if so be that the Reiection is a particular
act, so also is the new Election which ensued the same a little while after, an
act particular, of the like nature and condition.

So then, if the Estates of Bohemia cannot be accused to have committed the
heinous crime of Treason, against the person of an Emperor, nor against the
corpse or body of the Empire, by such an Abdication and new Election: what
reason is there to accuse the Elector Palatine Frederick, of Treason in the
highest degree, for that he has accepted the said Election.

And it is an objection very absurd, to allege, as some of the other side have
done, that the Archduke Ferdinand, and the Emperor Ferdinand, is but one
person, and that he who rejects the Archduke, reiecte^h the Emperor. This
is not but one and the same body, which does nevertheless represent diverse
persons, and it has been already said, that when the Archduke Ferdinand was
rejected, there was no Emperor Ferdinand at all. The King of Denmark is Duke
of Holstein, and because of that Duchy, he is a member of the Empire, having
a place of sitting amongst the Princes of the Empire, and yet the said sitting
does not represent the King of Denmark, but only and seperately the person of
a Duke of Holstein, inferior to many other Princes of the Empire. The King of
Spain is comprised amongst the Estates of the Empire, by reason of his
Provinces of hase Burgundy, and yet is not therefore admitted in the Sessions
of the Estates of the Empire, in quality of King of Spain. The Emperor
himself makes use of this distinction; For when complaint is made, that he
uses the people of the King of Spain, and brings strange Soldiers into the
Empire against the ordinance^ of the Empire, and his own Capitulation: he
answered, that he made use of the Duke of Burgundy, and of his assistance, as
of a Prince of the Empire though yet that he is helped in this assistance of
the money and means of all his Realms, and not of his Provinces of Burgundy
only: So the Emperor made not long since a like distinction about the King of
Denmark, saying in his answer to his Ambassador, that the King of Denmark
could not help nor assist the circle of the lower Saxony, as King of Denmark,
but only as a Duke of Holstein.

It is very true that the Palatine Elector is accused by some, not only for
that he has accepted the Crown of Bohemia, but also for that he has made
an Hostile invasion into the territory and dominion of Austrich, and by that
means violated the public peace of the Empire: but that is manifestly false,
for every one knows that it is not he, but the house of Austria, who have
kindled the war in Bohemia, and constrained the Estates of Bohemia, to put
and stand upon the defensive: and God, (before the entry of him into Bohemia,)
having blessed their Arms so far forth, as to repulse the Countess of
Bucquoy, and of Dampiere with their Armies, and driven them back into Austria,
from whence they were come, to invade and make great hauock in Bohemia, they
were obliged (and so they thought themselves) upon compulsion to keep their
forces and Armies within the said Countries and Dominions of Austria, thereby
to impeach their enemies, for coming and getting within the Realm of Bohemia,
and it was not in the power of the Elector Palatine, to make them retire and
go back, although he desired it never so much, forasmuch as that had been to
expose the said Estates, into the danger to see themselves again incontinently
assailed, within their own borders and confines, by their said enemies, even
as they had without that been very shortly after.

But as concerning the persons, who be at controversy for this affair and
business of Bohemia, every one of them has without comparison his more
eminent qualities peculiar to himself. But not to stay here to describe that
of the Emperor, who is the head and chief of all the Electors, Princes, and
Estates of the Empire, whose person is sacred, and ought after God to be
honored and respected above all others. It is sufficient to know, that the
Empire is not an Estate Monarchique, where the Prince rules absolutely, and
that the Emperors do not inherit their dignities and authorities, but that
they be conferred upon them, by the hands of the Electors, who, when they shall
abuse themselves therein, have the like power to deprive them, that they had to
give it them, even as it is verified by the fundamental laws, and by the
examples of the deposition by them made at other times, of the Emperors chosen
by them. Also it is found in the ancient Letters and documents of Germany,
that the Emperors be called sovereign Administrators and Tutors of the
Empire, whereby is gathered and collected, that they cannot attribute the
propriety thereof unto themselves, nor dispose thereof absolutely according to
their own fantasy, but that they are obliged and bound to yield and render an
account, and reckoning of their administration. And on the other side, the
Princes Electors be called by the constitutions of the Empire, and by the
Imperial Capitulation (which is holden for a fundamental law) the principal
Colomnes of the Empire, they having as Ephori, superintendencie and oversight
over all the body or corpse of the Empire, and be also obliged, by the duty of
their Offices, to maintain, in all, and through all, the observation of the
said Constitutions.

They have a College apart from others, and may assemble and meet whenever
they think good, to entreat of affairs of State, and be furnished and
endued with (as be also the other Princes and Estates respectively) with many
privileges, and immunities, which are confirmed by every Emperor, whenever
and as often as they choose and elect and Emperor: before all other things,
they prescribe unto him the conditions, upon which, they put the Scepter in his
hand, and make him to promise by a corporal and solemn oath, the observation
of them, and after that, they reciprocally do unto him the oath of fidelity,
as to their chief head and superior by them chosen, of their frank and free
will: By which it appears, that there is a very great difference between the
Emperors, and the Electors, and between the Kings Sovereigns by nature or
birth, and the Princes and Lords to them immediately Subjects.

And especially the Prince Palatine has dignities of great eminency, which
are allotted unto him pecnliarly, by the Golden Bull. First, in that, when the
Empire happens to be vacant, by the death of the Emperor, or that the
Emperor tranaileth out of the Empire, he then is to have the administration
of the affaaires of the Empire, in the Countries of the Rhine, of Sueuia, and
of the law Franconien. Secondly, in that by the same Golden Bull, he is
constituted and ordained Judge of the Emperor: when a third person has any
different or controversy with him, in the occurrences concerning the Empire.

Nevertheless, for all this, he does not leave to acknowledge the Emperor
that now is, for his head, and superior, chosen and confirmed in this dignity,
by the plurality of the Electorall voices: he does not dispute any thing
whatsoever appertaining unto the said Imperial dignity; He (as he from the
beginning hitherto has done) does offer and declare publicly to account and
respect him for such, and in that quality to give him all honor, reverence,
and obedience, conformable and agreeable unto the Constitutions of the Empire.

The Crown of Bohemia in controversy between them is, (as it is apparent and
evident by the aforesaid proofs) a particular difference, or controversy,
which is in question, not as between an Emperor and an Elector, but as
between two Princes of the Empire, of the which in this action, the one
neither can nor ought to have pre-eminence above the other, but have need of a
Judge impartial, such as the Emperor that now is, with the College of
Electors might be, if he were not interessed in the same, as party principal:
And as for the Electors, the most part of them be, from the beginning of these
troubles, made suspected, and incapable to interpose their judgment: For
first, and to begin, the three Ecclesiastical Electors fauourizing the
Archduke Ferdinand, even from before his Election Imperial, would not by any
means hear the griefs of the Estates of Bohemia against the said Archduke,
when they sent for that purpose their Ambassadors, unto the College of
Electors, at that time assembled at Franckfort, (as has been said) but
rejecting them, as coming about a particular difference (though by reason of
the Electorate annexed unto that Crown, all the said College, yea, the
generality of the Empire has interest therein) neither ceased they, until
the said Archduke was brought into the Conclaue of the Electors, as Elector of
Boheme. It is very true, that after this Introduction, and Election Imperial,
which ensued thereupon, the Emperor that now is, remitted and gave over the
decision of this Affair unto the arbitrage of all the Electors, who assigned a
day and place unto the said Estates of Bohemia, for to treat thereof. But they
would not then submit and yield themselves thereunto, forasmuch as the matter
was not now entire, and in the same estate it was, for that the said Electors,
by the said bringing and introduction of him into the College of the Electors,
had given an advantage unto their counter-partie. Where it is to be remarked,
that as well in the said Introduction as in the Election of the Emperor, the
Elector Palatine did by his Ambassadors make an express reservation for the
said Estates of Bohemia, of their right that did belong unto them. As
concerning that after the acceptance of the said Crown of Bohemia by the
Elector Palatine, the said three Electors Ecclesiastical, and the Elector of
Saxony, wrote from their Assembly holden at Mulhausen, as well unto the said
Estates, as to the said Elector Palatine, and others, that it appertained unto
them as Electors, to take knowledge of that fact, as of an Affair of the
Empire; there is a contradiction to be found therein: for at Francfort, the
three Ecclesiastical Electors declared, That they held the griefs and
pretensions of the said Estates for a particular fact, and would not by any
means, that it should be decided by the College of Electors: yea, which is
more, they wrote unto the Elector Frederick, which at that same time was in
the high Palatinate, to pray him to come in person to Francfort; and amongst
other points of their Letters, openly declared, That they would never suffer
the Estates of Bohemia to dispute or question Ferdinand about the Crown of
Bohemia: How could they then, in the interposition of their authority, upon
that difference, avoid the suspicion of partiality? Also it is to no purpose,
to allege in this difference the authority of the Emperor, to better and
gain the suit; for the authority Imperial, which the Archduke Ferdinand has
obtained after his abdication in Bohemia, has not meliorated his particular
cause, or made it more just. For example, if two Soldiers go to Law, or
contend for some Debt, or some other Quarrel, and if that one of them is made
Captain, and has obtained authority over the other, his cause is not any way
bettered by this new authority. If two Citizens be at Law for a piece of Land,
and if two Princes be in controversy for a Crown, and one is made Emperor;
shall he carry away the Crown by his new Imperial authority? Or else is it
not lawful in all causes for an inferior to pretend any right in a particular
fact against his superior? Behold then, as concerning the difference and
controversy of Bohemia; the decision of which, the Prince Elector Palatine
has been always, and is, ready to remit, either to a Sentence of impartial
Justice, or to the Arbitrage of eminent persons, capable of the cause, and not
adherent and leaning unto the other party alone.

Touching the third Head.
NOw that we have heretofore made it apparent, and evident, by the quality of
the Controversy, and other circumstances, that the Emperor could not
interpose therein his Imperial authority, to his own proper advantage, and
to the prejudice of the Prince Elector Palatine; this conclusion follows
thereon, without contradiction, that the Proscription is praecipitated, and
unlawfully done: The which is deduced, shown, and proved so apparently, in
many other Writings published, that it should be superfluous to make any great
or long discourse; but it suffices to add in this place some example and
instance of the evident Nullities which are found in the said Proscription.

First, the Emperor (from the beginning) bore himself as Demaundant and
Plaintiff against the Prince Palatine, and in stead of pursuing him by the way
of impartial Justice, he has pursued him with all Hostility, with Fire and
Sword, showing by all sort of violence, that his principal Butt and Mark was
no other, but to revenge himself, and to ruinate the other utterly, as by his
Letters and Writings, as well particular as public, and above all things, the
effects which have ensued thereof, have verified, that such have been his
Designs. He could not then be Judge and Party at one time, much less could
he pronounce the Sentence, that should be impartial, and exempt from the
appetite of bitter revenge.

Secondly, the Emperor has commenced this Process, to wit, by the execution,
and the aforementioned Hostilities, without citation, without judicial
recognition of the cause, and without hearing the defense of the Prince
Palatine.

Thirdly, the proscription has been precipitated, and published, against the
Constitutions of the Empire, without the advice and approbation of the Electors
jointly: For though that this Arrest and Decree has been deliberated on with
the knowledge and consent of the Ecclesiastical Electors; so it is, that that
which was done, was done in particular and in hugger mugger, the secular
Electors never giving their consent thereunto: Neither was the resolution of
the same taken Collegiately, for it was taken in the house of the Count of
Ogniate, Ambassador of Spain, at Vienna, as it appears by the Letters of
the said Count of Ogniate; and information is had thereof by other means also.

For the fourth, it is founded partly upon certain ancient Constitutions of
the Empire, made against the breakers of the public peace, who would not
submit themselves unto Justice, nor be reduced unto Peace, except they were
constrained by force of Arms. The said Constitutions do not any way touch the
Prince Palatine, for that he did not raise the War in Bohemia, and meddled
not therein, but for their defense; being always ready (as has been said)
to undergo the decision of his Cause, either by way of Justice, or by an
impartial interposition: And as to the authority absolute, to proscribe a
Prince Elector without the universal consent of the Electors, without
recognition of the cause, without citation, and without the hearing of the
justification of the party accused, that is in one word a thing never heard of
in the Empire. And though that the Emperor had had such an authority absolute,
and that it had been founded upon the said Constitutions: so it is, that he
cannot make any use of it without infringing the Capitulation, and his oath,
which is quite contrary, as it apparently and evidently appears, by the
ensuing extraict of the 25. and 26. Articles of the said Capitulation of the
clause, comprised in the 28 Article, and of the last Article.

ALL the other Articles of the said Capitulation do contain also conditions
and promises, so aduantageous unto the Electors, Princes, and Estates of the
Empire, that it is impossible to make as much as any one of them valuable or of
force, to cloak or palliate the lest that may be of the injustice of the said
Proscription, except that any one will hold and maintain, that the solemn
oath madeby his Majesty Imperial in the confirmation of them, is not
obligatory, and that in reading the said conditions and promises, one ought to
understand them contrary to the words set down.

Behold, I say, some scantlings of the Nullities of the said Proscription; for
the rest of the things that are defective in the same, I remit you unto the
Treatises and deductions, more amply set down in print, and published unto the
world.

And besides the said Nullities, the text of the Proscription is farced, and
stuffed, with many false narrations, by the which, some labor to deingrate the
Prince Palatine, and to make him more odious, and to give some color of
Justice unto this unjust proceedings: For he is accused to have practiced with
the Turk, and to have exposed thereby Christendom, unto extreme danger, the
which calumnious slander is drawn out of that, that the Estates of Hungary
and Bohemia, conioyntly with the Provinces incorporated, sent in the year
1620. an Ambassade unto Constantinople. But it is not enough to accuse him, but
it is reason rather to have proofs: the depeach and the instruction of the
said Embassade (the counter-partie whereof is in men's hands) shows the quite
contrary. And since that they of the other party dare not show, nor publish
it, because that the said slander cannot be verified thereby, the good
compatriotes have caused it not long since to be published, and imprinted,
that it might be communicated unto all the World, who may see by the same,
that the Butt and end of the said Embassade was for no other end and purpose,
then to obtain a firm peace with that puissant Neighbor, and Borderer, and
redoutable Enemy of Christendom, and by that means to impeach and divert
him, to make use and benefit of those occasions that the unfortunate War,
raised and begun by them of the House and Family of Austria, presented unto
him, of inuading and piercing into the said Realms, and Provinces: And that
was done the more, for that the said House of Austria had unarmed and
disfurnished the Fortresses and Frontiers of Hungary of their Munitions of
War, for to employ them against the Estates of Bohemia, where indeed they
should have made them to serve against the invasion of the Turk, unto the
which they were destinate and appointed, and unto which the Estates of the
Empire had contributed, with the expenses of their own money.

Now to give some appearance and color unto this unjust Proscription, the
contrary party makes a great show, with rehearsing the example of the
Elector John Frederick of Saxony, who in the year one thousand five hundred
forty six, was proscribed by the Emperor Charles the fifth; by the execution
of the which, he was despoyled of one part of his Countries, and of his
Dignity Electorall, wherewith the Dukes, Maurice, and Auguste of Saxony, and
their descendents, were invested, with the exclusion of his three sons, and
of his brother. But this example has no resemblance with that of the Prince
Palatine.

For first, after the declaration of the Ban, he was offered a Treaty of
Peace, by the entermise of the Elector Frederick the second, Count Palatine,
and of Doctor Eck, Counselor of the Emperor Charles the sist; but he utterly
refused it. On the contrary, the Elector Palatine has sought by all means an
equitable peace, and cannot obtain it.

Secondly, the Elector John Frederick and his Confederates made open War
against the Emperor Charles the fifth, whom they would not acknowledge for
Emperor, calling him Charles of Gaunt, who named himself Emperor; and that
which is more, they sent him a Cartell, or Letter of Defiance, and in solemn
manner renounced the Oath they had formerly made unto him. But it has been
demonstrated here before, that the Elector Palatine did not meddle, nor had any
contention with the Emperor Ferdinand, as with an Emperor, but as with an
Archduke of Austria; who, before that he came to the Crown Imperial, had
already commenced and begun the War. And as for the Dignity Imperial, the
Elector Palatine has always protested to recognize him for Emperor; and in
this quality, to render and to give him all obedience and respect, in
conformity unto the Constitutions of the Empire.

Thirdly, the Elector John Frederick (at that time detained and kept prisoner)
renounced the foureteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord, one thousand
five hundred forty and seven, in the Camp before Wittenberg, for him and his
heirs, all the Rights that he could pretend upon the Electorate of Saxony;
the which Renunciation was ratified by his three sons, and his brother: which
thing cannot be said on the behalf of the Elector Palatine. And though that
the example of the Elector Palatine may not be compared and resembled with the
example of the Elector John Frederick of Saxony: (between the which, there
is as much difference notwithstanding, then there is between Summer and
Winter) so it is, that there is not any that can justify the said pretended
Proscription, for that the Emperor which is now at this day, is obliged and
bound by his Capitulation confirmed by his corporal Oath, not to do the like
thereafter.

Since that then the Injustice of the Proscription precipitated against the
Prince Palatine, is so unjust, it will not be amiss to see and view also the
Injustice, or more rather, enormious excess of the Execution.

The Execution has been commenced a good space of time before the publication
of the Sentence; and as well before, as after, the Palatinate has been made
the Scaffold, upon the which has been played the most horrible, the most
cruel, and the most detestable Tragedies, that ever any man heard or saw,
since the Empire had the Name of Christian. Some pretend, that the Prince has
offended, and for it the people have been punished. These poor innocent
Countries have been exposed in prey unto foreign and strange Nations,
Cossaques, Croatians, and other Barbarians, who under the sacred Name of the
Emperor, have pilled, saccaged, rauaged, massacred them, and burned their
habitations and houses; in such sort, that the Heavens does bemoane and feel
the sobbes and groans of many thousand Christian souls, that never had any
knowledge, and much less of partaking in the Affairs of Bohemia: The Air is
yet obscured and darkened with the smoke of so many Towns, Villages,
Boroughes, Castles, Houses, and Hamlets, burned and consumed with Fire; and the
Earth is yet all moist, and dyed (as it were) with a deluge of blood, at the
which the living have horror, and the posterity will have detestation. These
poor innocents are brought under the yoke of a perpetual misery: there is
carried away out of the Palatinate a great number of persons, women and
children, into strange Countries; of the which, some have been barbarously
sold upon the frontiers of Turkey: And in most parts of the Palatinate* these
wretched souls are daily deprived of the exercises of their Religion, that not
only the solace of their bodies is taken from them, but they are also deprived
of the consolation of their souls. The Country is dismembered, the Territories
are divided, and the Subjects are constrained and enforced to do homage unto
strangers. The little that remains of their goods, is confiscated; and
especially, the goods of Officers and servants of the said Lord are escheated.
To be short, there is done all the mischief and evil, that the malice of men
can devise.

And for the execution of all those violences and excesses, the Duke of Bauyer,
and those of the League, have most passionately and furiously employed their
Arms; and the doing there of, does violate and break the faith and promise by
them given and made at the Treaty of Vlmes: in the which it was accorded and
decreed, under the Signature, Letters, and Seals of the said Duke of Bauyer,
That they shall not make any Invasion, or Act of Hostility, within the one or
the other of the two Palatinates, under any color, name, or pretext,
whatsoever it was, nor to meddle with any thing within the said Palatinates.

But that is not all: These Outrages were not committed only against the
Elector Palatine, but they have driven away the Duke of Symmeren, his brother,
out of his Patrimony, his Countries, Goods, and Revenues; they have ruined
his subjects, who are yet to this day incessantly evil entreated, and consumed
and impouerished with all sort of Exactions, Contributions, and other
insupportable Charges: And yet he was never accused, much less convicted of
any Crime; yea, rather the Emperor himself has declared him to be innocent.

The bordering Countries have not been much better dealt withal, and
entreated, but extremely molested, pilled, and rauaged, in diverse quarters,
against the Treaty of M^^tz, and of Asc^affenburg, made by the Commiss^ries of
the Emperor with them of the Union, and ratified by the Imperial Majesty: by
the which Treaties, it was promised unto all the Princes, Estates, and Cities
of the Empire, That unto them there should no Hurt, D^mmage, Incommoditie, or
Trouble be done, for or concerning the subject of these Affairs, nor
otherwise.

And not to stand and enlarge ones self upon the particulars, but to descend
and come unto the generality; this Proscription, and Execution so vindicatiue,
has in that manner afflicted all the Corpse and Body of the Empire, that it
seems to be the downfall of its total ruin.

Moreover, they were not content to deprive the Prince Palatine of his Estates
and Dignities Electoralls, but they have also deprived his Children, and
Brother, and his other near Kinsmen, though they were all Innocents, taking
away from them the benefit of their Inuestitutes in Remainder, and Reuersion,
for to give them unto the Duke of Bauyer, in recompense of so much blood he
has shed, and fire kindled; and when he has put him in the pretended
possession of the said Estates, and Dignities, the said Kinsmen and Allies are
put unto suite together, by way of Law, or by an amiable Composition, to whom
they shall appertain after the death of the Dukes of Bauyer: and you
nevertheless, before the Cause come so far, there are given unto the Duke of
Neaburg Letters of expectancie, for to be preferred thereto, and placed
therein, before all others.

The true cause of this extraordinary rigorous proceedings against the House
Electorall Palatine, is clearly expressed in the Letters written by the
Emperor unto Don Balthazar d' Cuiuga, principal Councellor unto the King of
Spain, dated the fifteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one
thousand six hundred twenty and one, to be seen in the Chancelrie of Spain
(a Book so called) that is to say, That forasmuch as they have heretofore made
opposition unto the House of Austria, the which thinks, that it cannot extend
his domination so far, as it proiccteth, if that the said House of the
Palatine be not utterly ruinated.

So also the translation of the Electorate into the House of Bauyer,
expressedly declares in the Postscript of the same Letters, That the Butt
thereof is, that by means thereof the Catholic Romans may have more, and
plurality of Voices, in the College of the Electors, and that the Empire may
be perpetuated in the House of Austria; unto the advancement of which, the
Duke of Bauyer shall be obliged and bound, for this great benefit received from
the House of Austria.

The Practices and secret Drifts, the Letters sent unto Rome, into Spain, and
sundry parts of Almaigne, the counterfeit Embassades sent here and there,
under false pretexts and semblants, and infinite other cunning Tricks, whereof
they make use to further their Affairs, and to bring them unto the point where
they are seen to be at this day, be so many in number, that they would make a
great Book, to comprise them all: The intention of this Information, being
only to demonstrate a far off the wrong that is done unto the Elector
Palatine, and his Children and Friends.

Touching the fourth Head.
IT has been said in the first Head, That at the very beginning of the
Troubles of Bohemia, the Prince Elector Palatine desirous to see the Peace
established there, and the Subjects reconciled unto their King, sent an
Ambassador unto the Emperor at Vienna, for to desire him to vanquish
himself, to lay down Arms, and surcease from violence, and to quench the
fire of a pernicious War at the first. But that was in vain; for the
Ambassador continued his Suit instantly many months together, to his great
charges, at Vienna; but returned, and obtained nothing.

After the death of the Emperor Matthias, the King of great Briraine to
testify and witness his good intentions, toward the public good of all
Germany, sent the Vicount Doncaster, Councellor in his Councels of Estate, and
Gentleman of his Chamber, in Ambassade unto the Archduke Ferdinand, at that
time designed King of Bohemia, and other Princes of the Empire, to mediate an
accommodation between the said Ferdinand, and the said Estates of Bohemia, and
by this sweet and mild way, to reduce and bring the parties unto repose and
rest, and to prevent the evils which have afterward miserably afflicted, do
afflict, and will afflict still all the corpse and body of the fifth Empire, yea
and of all Christendom, if God by his grace do not give a conuenable remedy
thereunto. The said Ambassador met the Archduke Ferdinand at Ratisbone, in the
way for to go unto the Diet of Franckfort, called for the Election of a new
Emperor: he was given to understand, that in that place of Ratisbone, the
affairs of Bohemia could not be treated of; and that therefore he should
return back, and go unto Franckfort, where there would be better commodity
to confer with the Electors, and to take a good resolution therein; but he
thinking to obtain so much as to enter into the Town for that purpose, was
not permitted so to do, under the pretext and color, that it was against the
Golden Bull, to permit strangers, Princes, or Ambassadors, during the holding
of the same Diet, to enter into the Town. So that he was constrained to
withdraw himself unto Hanau, and there to stay a long time at great charges
and expenses, for that he had a very great train: And though he requested
oftentimes, and with great instance to be admitted and heard; yet he could not
obtain, until that Ferdinand was brought into the Conclaue Electorall, and by
that means chosen Emperor: And for that the Emperor, after that he was
come, by his reception unto the College Electorall, as King of Bohemia, unto
the mark he aimed, had remitted the said affair and business of Bohemia
unto the Arbitrage of the Electors, the negotiation of the said Lord
Ambassador was made frustrate, and he dismissed to go unto the place from
whence he came. Behold here the first affront made unto the King of great
Britain in his interposition.

In the year of our Lord, One thousand six hundred and twenty: The King of
Spain and the Archduke Albertus set on foot a puissant Army in the Provinces
of Burgogne, in the month of July and August, the King of great Britain
advertised from other places, that it was to invade the lower Palatinate, sent
Sir Edward Conway and Sir Richard Weston his Ambassadors, unto the Archduke at
Bruxelles, to exhort him not to make any invasion into the Palatinate, with
offers to interpose his good Offices for the advancement and furthering of an
amiable and friendly composition, unto whom answer was given: That the King of
Spain and his Highness had assembled and formed an Army for the service of
the Emperor, and that as yet the resolution was not taken, in what place that
Army should he employed. Now it is a thing to be noted, that the said Army
marched already toward the Palatinate, when that they made this answer full
of mockery unto the said Ambassadors.

Incontinently after the publication of the Ban against the Prince Pala^^ne,
the Princes and Estates united, dispached their Ambassadors unto to beseech
him to suspend the execution thereof, and to give way unto an accommodation,
for to stop the evils that would ensue thereof infallibly, assuring themselves
to dispose the said Prince Palatine unto all things that should be thought
conuenable and equitable for the common good and repost, but such answer was
made unto them in the Emperors name, that they might understand that nothing
was intended and to be looked for, but fire and sword.

The King of Denmark also bestowing therein the same offices by his
Ambassadors, was paid with like money as the Princes and Estates united were.

And for that the Prince Elector Palatine had betrusted all this affair, in
the interposition of the Kings of great Britain, and of Denmark, with
promise to ratify and accomplish all whatsoever, they concluded or accorded in
his name, so that it were not against his conscience or his honor: his Majesty
of great Britain (unto whom he afterward remitted the negotiation thereof, and
granting to do all that he shall judge most fitting, for the recovering of his
Estates and dignities, and the re-establishment of a firm peace in the Empire)
voluntarily charged himself with this entermise, and promised, as he has
promised oftentimes hitherto, to employ therein all his possible means, and to
expose therein, if need be, all that God has given him in this world, judging
it better, notwithstanding, it to be the better and more reasonable to search
and make use of the way of mildness, before that he proceeded unto extremities.

This is the matter, why his Majesty of Great Britain sent the Lord Digby,
Counselor of Estate, and Gentleman of his Chamber, unto the Emperor in the
month of June, with large instructions and power, to labor to bring the
affairs unto some good composition. The Archduke Albertus had then granted a
truce in the lower Palatinate for some weeks, which began to expite, and the
high Palatinate was yet in the hands of the Prince Palatine, but terribly
menaced, and in great fear, by reason of the great preparations of war made
by the Duke of Bauier, to gain and win the same under the title of a
Commission Imperial to him given. The Ambassador Digby used all his forces
and diligences possible for the discharge of his Ambassade, daily redoubling
his instances toward his Majesty Imperial, the which declared that he
desired nothing more, (then peace, ^^ the Prince Palatine would first make
satisfaction, and submission, unto the which was added, sometime one thing, and
then at another time, another thing; only (as the effects testified) for to
gain and win time, until the Truce was expired: And that the Duke of Bauyer
might have an occasion to give a blow upon the high Palatinate, without the
impeachment of Count Mansfelt, who had amazed and gathered together some
Troops, upon the Frontiers of Bohemia. The said Truce being expired, the
Spaniards recommenced the War in the lower Palatinate, the Emperor not
abiding to give any ear unto the prorogation of the Truce, alleging many new
pretexts: yet nevertheless, his Imperial Majesty, and they of his Council,
put the said Ambassador in hopes, by fair words, and goodly promises, That
the Duke of Bauyer (whose Commission had been suspended by the order of the
Emperor, at the solicitation of the said Ambassador) should not receive any
new Commission, and should be enjoined not to make hereafter the execution of
the Ban against the higher Palatinate. And finally, upon the reiterated
instances of the Ambassador, and upon certain Conditions and Promises by him
offered, his Imperial Majesty consented unto a Treaty, and wrote unto the
Infanta of Spain the eleventh of September, giving her power to agree with the
King of Great Britain (if the Affairs in those Quarters permitted her) and
decree with him a suspension or deposition of Arms, that by that means they
might enter into a friendly and amiable conference of a peace and
accommodation. The Ambassador trusting and confiding in all these
Declarations, Promises, and Words, and not being able to obtain more at their
hand, took leave of the Emperor, and made have in his return, with a purpose
to bring (by the power of the Commission given unto the Infanta) his Affairs
to some good pass. But in his return he was advertised, and saw himself,
that the Duke of Bauyer was made Master of all the whole high Palatinate, and
constrained the subjects to do him homage; whereof he made complaints unto the
Emperor by his Letters of the fifth of October, making unto him a remonstration,
that the same was done unto the prejudice of his Declaration, and against that
which his Counselors had given him to understand.

Being arrived at Bruxels, he assayed and tried by all means to obtain a
suspension of Arms: which thing was impossible, forasmuch as the Emperor had
commanded the said Infanta, by other Letters written (unknowing unto the said
Ambassador) That she should not make any accord of Truce, and that his Majesty
Imperial had enjoined Don Cordua to proceed: So that the contrariety of these
Letters, dispatched and sent at one and the same time, upon one and the same
subject, is evidently discovered by the answer the Infanta gave unto the
Ambassador, on the eight day of November, a thousand six hundred twenty and
one: which was done not to lose, but to follow the advantage which the
counterpartie had gotten by the occupation of the high Palatine, and the
greatest part of the low Palatinate, and that there rested no more to take, but
Heydelberg Manheym, and Frankendale, and some other small places; to the
Conquest of which, the Duke of Bauyer sent the greatest part of his Army,
which joined it self unto the Spaniards under diverse pretexts: insomuch, that
all the endeavors that his Majesty of Great Britain had made at Bruxels, for
to procure some small release and ease unto the poor Palatinate, and to
mediate a treaty of Peace, were as unprofitable as the precedent, and former
at Vienna: where yet nevertheless was made all manner of fair semblant, and
seeming to have a desire to give satisfaction unto his said Majesty, who
demanded an entire restitution of the high and low Palatinate, and of the
Dignity Electorall, for his son in law, who on the other part promised to
yield up and surrender the Crown of Bohemia; and as concerning the submission,
to do (unto the which, they on the other side insisted strongly, without any
intention to accept thereof) all that which might be done, without prejudice of
the Constitutions of the Empire.

The Army of the Papistique League, and those of the Spaniards, did extremely
rauage the low Palatinate: upon which, the Count Palatine was constrained to
go thither in person, and to make all the resistance possible with the Troops
of the Count of Mansfelt.

His Majesty of Great Britain seeing that the enemies reenforced themselves,
and grew strong daily, and had enterprised to import and to conquer all the low
Palatinate, as well as the high Country; he thought it good to write unto the
Emperor by a Corrieur, or Post, sent of purpose, and to offer him, in the
behalf of his son in law, by his Letters (which were of the twelfth of
November, one thousand six hundred twenty and one) Conditions of Peace, such
as he thought as impossible, that the Emperor (of whose pacifique intentions
all men spoke) ought or could refuse them. And to the end he might lay an
assured foundation upon the said offers, he seriously exhorted the Prince
Elector Palatine, his son in law, to ratify them, and to promise the
accomplishment of them, by an authentical Instrument, signed with his hand,
and sealed with his seal; the which he did, dated the five and twentieth day
of the said month of November, preferring the public peace and repose of
Germany, before all the particular considerations of himself and his House.

And though there was no speech in the Court at Vienna, and that of Bruxels,
made unto the Ambassadors and ministers of the King of Great Britain, of any
other thing, then of the pacifique intentions of the Emperor, and of the
resolution that he had to give all satisfaction unto his Majesty of Great
Britain; so it is, that yet he did not accept the said Conditions, and so by
the refusal of them, dispensed the Prince Elector Palatine not to be bound and
obliged therewith, and sent the Count of Schwartzenburg into England, only for
to make all sort of complement, and gave a new Commission unto the Infanta to
treat with the King of great Britain about a suspension and laying down of
Arms, and also of a peace, and made in that same time, the War to be
continued in the lower Palatinate, unto the Princes and Estates Euangeliques of
the Empire he dissimuled, and would not be known of the same conditions; but
he caused them to be communicated unto the Prince Bethelem Gabor, who upon
that took occasion to make peace with the Emperor; whereupon it ensued, that
the greatest part of the troops which were in Austria, Bohemia, and other
places were sent into the lower Palatinate, to make an end of all:
notwithstanding, his Majesty of great Britain was continually assured of the
restitution, and offers were made of a treaty of peace: to be brief, promises
were made upon promise, and so his Majesty entered into a new parley, and sent
Sir Richard Weston unto Bruxels to treat with the Infanta, who ordained and
appointed Commissioners for that effect and purpose, who for to gain and win
time, exacted of the said Ambassador a plain power signed with the hand of
the Prince Palatine, to the end (as they said) they might be assured, that he
would ratify and accomplish all that they should conclude and determine: and
although that his Majesty had already sufficient power, upon many Letters of
his son in law; so it is, that they would see a plenipotency or full power
inform, that which his Majesty granted them, and caused a plenipotency or
full power to be dispatched by his said Emb^ssadour as well in his own name,
as in the name of his son in law, who signed the same jointly with his
Majesty, and sent the same to Bruxels, where the said plain power being come,
the Commissioners found therein one only word repeated; to wit, the title of
Elector, which was given unto the said Prince, and prayed that the said full
power might be reformed and renewed, and that title put out thereof, alleging
that they could not well treat that title being in: and so his Majesty to
take away all exceptions, made the said power, with the omission of that title,
to be drawn again; but yet with an exception that it should not at any time
prejudice him by any means. These commings and goings too and fro, caused by
the contreparty, were for no other end, but draw out and to prolong the
business, and to hinder and empeach, that his Majesty (who had already
promised to entertain 8000. footmen, and 1600. horse in the Pala^inate, at his
own charges,) should not send thither any great succor, not make any
diuersion in Flanders, nor any where else. The said power then having bin made,
made again, signed, and sent the second time at the instances of the said
Commissioners, his Majesty received Letters from the Emperor, written the 18.
of June, by the which he gave him to understand, that the treaty of peace could
not well be made nor concluded at Bruxels, since that the affair and business
concerned and touched all the Empire, and that therefore he had called an
assembly of the Electors, and some other Princes at Ratisbone, remitting and
leaving it unto the good pleasure of his Majesty, if he would send any one
thither on his behalf. The which contrary and undue procedure, his Majesty
took as strange, and thereof made sharp and bitter complaints unto the Emperor
in his answer. And for that the rest of the Palatinate stood in danger to be
lost, not being able to resist such puissant enemies, his Majesty in some
manner to break that blow, took into his protection the Towns of Heydelberg,
Manheym, and Frankendale, but that was no hinderance: for the two first were
besieged and furiously battered, Heydelberg taken by assault and pillaged, and
that of Manheym taken by composition; so that there remained none but the Town
of Frankendale only; for the conservation of the which, his Majesty seeing that
it would be left in his protection no more then the other two, found it good,
and at the instance and great promises of the Infanta, to sequester it into her
hands, and she gave the government thereof unto Don Verdugo, a Nobleman of
Spain, who put therein a Garrison, the which at this day menaceth incessantly
the poor Burgesses, to pillage them for want of their payment, though it be
not bound to satisfy them for the same.

After the taking and total ruin of the Palatinate, the Emperor made have with
the Diet of Ratisbon, and was there in person, where he invested publicly the
Duke of Bauier with the Palatinat Electorall, to the exclusio^ of the children
of the brother, and the nearest kinsmen of the Prince Palatine (against the
advice and opposition of the Electors of Saxony and of Brandemburg, who pressed
by their Ambassadors, the entire restitution of his Countries and dignities)
And gave the King of Great Britain to understand by his Letters, dated at
Raitsbone the fifth of March, one thousand six hundred twenty and three, in the
which he added amongst other clear testimonies of his great good will toward
his Majesty, that his translation of the Electorate in the house of Bauiere,
was made with express reservation, That it shall be permitted by especial
grace unto the Grand children of his Majesty, and unto his other kinsmen, to
treat hereafter in some Town Imperial, as Nuremburg, Angsberg, Vlm, or
Franckfort, touching the right that every one of them may pretend in the titles
and Dignities Electoralls: and if so be that they cannot agree and accord
together, that it shall be lawful for them to commence suit, and enter into
process before the Majesty Imperial, and the College of the Electors, where
they may assure and promise to themselves a quick dispatch, and Justice soon
administered, if they themselves do not hinder the same, by some act of their
own; by the which reservation, his Majesty of Great Britain may see the
most sincere affection the said Majesty Imperial bore unto him, and to his
posterity. This is the substance of the said Letters of the Emperor.

Now let every one give his judgment of this goodly declaration. And it ought
not to be passed in silence, that at his departure from the Diet at Ratisbone,
the Emperor, as it is said, made show in the said Letters to reserve unto the
children, brother, and kinsfolks of the Prince Palatine, some permission to
dispute the right, that they would pretend after the Duke of Bauier; promised
the expectancy of the Electorate unto the Duke Wolfgang. William of Neuburg,
confirmed by Letters and Seals.

And as the Emperor has always made prosession of good will toward the King
of Great Britain, and to give ear unto the entire restitution which he has
sought by friendship, and by the way of amity with great trouble and charge;
but in vain: So also has the King of Spain done the very same almost, until
that the Palatinate has been reduced unto the more then miserable estate, as
it is at this day, and that the Duke of Bauier has been put in full
possession of all the high, and of the greatest part of the lower Palatinate,
together with the dignity Electorall: for though the King of Spain has
oftentimes assured his Majesty of great Britain, as well by his Letters as
by his Ambassadors, seriously to cooperate and join with him, for to obtain
the entire restitution of the Palatinate Electorall, and of that which
depends thereof, with an express promise for this effect to join his Arms
with those of his Majesty if need was: This notwithstanding, when he has
been finally demanded by his own Ambassadors, a special declaration by
writing, he has answered, That he cannot do it, for that, beside, that it
shall be to deprive him to have any hand in it, and the Arbitrage in this
affair, as a mediator or friend, that it may also not only give cause unto
the Emperor his Uncle, to take an unkindness or offense thereat; but also,
that if he shall mingle threats and Arms, with the Offices of interposition,
it shall be an unkindness and dis-office in his deportment which he ought in
reason to use toward his Imperial Majesty: by the which answer it appears
evidently, that all the said promises of Spain have been nothing but words.

For the closure of this Information, we are moreover to recount an artifice
and cunning trick, whereof the contrary party does make use; That is: The
Infanta of Spain under the color and disguise of an Imperial Commission, and
of an extreme desire to re-establish peace in the Empire, and to give
satisfaction unto the King of Great Britain, made a proposition of certain
Articles of a truce of fifteen months in the lower Palatinate, and generally
for all the Empire, to the end, that in this space of time a treaty of a firm
peace might be had: So, that his Majesty, after he had changed some thing in
the said Articles, condiscended thereunto, and signed them, sending them unto
the Prince Elector Palatine, for to sign them also; who (after he had deferred
a little while to consent unto them, because of the captious Articles he saw in
them) upon the instances that were made, and the hopes that the counterparty
made him take of an accommodation, signed them in like manner: but all that
came unto nothing. For never since have they ceased to exercise against the
poor Subjects of the Palatinate, all sorts of rigours, and violences; neither
will they observe the Articles of truce, under diverse new colors and pretexts
forged and framed out of their own fantasies and brains. The Butt and end of
this counterfeited and disguised truce, was, for that Austria and Spain
desired to take from the Prince Palatine the power of seeking the succors and
assistance of foreign Kings and Princes, and especially to prevent, that
(peradventure) he should not make use of the Forces and Armies, the Duke of
Brunswick, and Count Mansfelt had then on foot, and that by that occasion the
Prince Bethelem Gabor should not take occasion to make any invasion against the
House of Austria. But at that same time, the Army of the Duke of Brunswick
having been put to rout and defeated by a fatal destiny, Austria and Spain
seeing themselves come to that Butt they shot at, made a mockery of the said
Truce, and continuated their Hostilities, and a little after departed, and
delivered unto the Archbishop of Mentz the Country of Bergstrate (which is one
of the best Provinces of the Palatinate) for to oblige him so much the more
strictly to maintain and defend their party against the Prince Palatine, and
have imposed upon the poor subjects, as well of the Palatinate Electorall, as
upon the Country of the Prince of Symmeren, diverse impositions, to them
insupportable, which endure yet, and are augmented every day.

It is also to be remarked, that the said Articles of Truce were communicated
in the name of the Emperor, unto some Princes of the Empire, a whole month
before that they were concluded, and accepted in England; and that in other
form, and partly in another sense, only for to gain advantage, and to render
and make the Electors and Princes of the Empire irresolute, and to hinder them
from favoring the Prince Elector Palatine, whose total ruin and extirpation
being the Butt and Mark (what semblant or show soever they had made to his
Majesty of Great Britain) unto which they have directed all their Actions,
for to effectuate all their abouesaid Designs.

By all the which Drifts and Practices it may be seen, as in a Mirror, with
how much misprision they have most unworthily abused the King of Great
Britain; and certes he had desired much, that it might have passed in
silence. But since that Murder and Slanders be the two Instruments, whereof
the adherents of the contrary party make use, utterly to overthrow the Prince
Palatine, and his friends; it is ineuitably necessary to represent and
demonstrate all that which is before written, by this brief Information. The
Murders be seen by all the World, and the Calumnies and Slanders are made to
sound in the cares of every one, in accusing the said Prince and his friends
of things whereof they never thought.

But for to avoid prolixitie, among other things it is published, written, and
blown abroad in all places continually, That the said Lord the Prince has not
from the beginning of these Troubles, hitherto shown any sign of his
inclination unto Peace; but that all his Designs has been no other, then to
carry and bear himself with extremity of War, to the ruin of the Empire,
and to the peril of Christendom. But before God, and them who know the
contrary, there is produced here for Witnesses and Testimonies against this
falsehood, all the Interpositions, Embassades, Requests, Offers, and
Declarations abouesaid.
