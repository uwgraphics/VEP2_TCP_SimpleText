THE TRVE EXEMPLARY, AND REMARKABLE HIStory of the Earl of Tirone:

Wherein the manner of his first presumption, affrighting both England and
Ireland with his own and the King of Spaines Forces, and the misery of his
ensuing deiection, downfall, and utter banishment is truly related:

Not from the report of others, or collection of Authors, but by him who was an
eye witness of his fearful wretchedness, and final extirpation.

Eurip: Orestes: TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, THE Earl of Clenricard, Governor of
Conach, and Councellor of State in his Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland.
RIGHT HONORABLE:
I Have my self been an eyewitness of your Loyalty, and general love to
our Country, or if you please, the Majesty of England, and can resolve the
strangest humor'st; that never man deserved better of the State, then your
self for many employments: But especially, when I saw you Knighted in the
Field (and none but your self) yea the durty fields before Kinsole, my heart
leaped for joy to apprehend, that your Virtue and worth commanded that addition
of Honor, without which, let ambitious hastiness imagine what it list,
Princes cannot set their best Favorites on a more substantial Seat of
glorious eminence: And thus much for the general. For particulars, I was in
those days beholding to your Table and Purse, and in a manner the third
Officer of your Regiment; as it pleased you to grace and favor me far beyond
my desert. All which considered, as I have great reason to be thankful unto
you, so could I think of no better means, then this poor Dedication: First,
because I am resolved it will out-last a Marble Toombe, and when Death has
undertaken to obliterate our memories, yet shall after-ages demand, who this
Earl of Clenricard was, and wish from their hearts, that the Noble men of
their times would set you before them for a Mirror: Secondly, because it is the
remarkeablest Story of Ireland, and a business so well known to your self,
that I submit to your better judgment, if I have failed in any thing: Thirdly,
because I am taught by experience, that there is no presenting of Books to any
man, without a primordiall acquaintance, secret supportation, or (as we call
it) Court friendship. Last of all, and I hope the best of all, because it may
stand in the stead of Precept, or Caution to detain such worthy persons
within their own Circles, or divert them from presuming on any power against
such a Prince, as the Monarch of Great Britain, of government, as the Majesty
of England: In which assurance, I leave you to the Commander of all Thoughts,
Words, and Actions, submitting my self and the work, to your favorable
censure, and Honorable acceptance.

Your Honors humbly devoted, Th. Gainsforde.

THE EXEMPLARY HISTORY AND Lamentable deiection of the Heart of Tyrone.
THEY, which write of the Basilisck, and would seem to dispell the vapors of
ignorance, with the strong and swift wind of knowledge: report, that whosoever
he looks upon, dies the death, but if he be first discovered, his own venom
poisons himself: whereupon Treasons are resembled to his eyes, which of their
own nature must needs prevail without prevention, but made apparent by some
timely intelligence, they are broken as we say, in the shell; and strangled in
the Womb: Notwithstanding, such has been the secrets of Innovation, and
disposition of turbulent spirits, that they ever had a trick to fly to
foreign Princes for refuge, when their own designs were unable to stand
upright in the frame of government. And although I never read of subject, that
returned to recover his estate, or purposes, by the mere coadiutement of a
foreign King (except that King proiected for himself, to make another
disloyalty the steps to stand more firmly upon, and raise his own ambition
to a greater height) yet have they not desisted to follow the deceits of their
own hearts, and as the Jews found a rotten Reed and broken Staff of Egypt,
undertaken impossibilities, to the destruction of infinite thousands, and at
the best but the saving of their own lives for a time.

For although Hadad an Edomite of the Kings seed fled unto Pharao King of
Egypt, who gave him a House, Land, and the sister of his wife, even Taphnes
the Queen, whereby it should seem he thriued in his revolt: Yet alas was it
so far from preiudicing of Solomon, that he only discovered a willingness,
without power or means to disturb the State, and made the great King stand on
his guard the better: Although Jeroboam fled unto Sisag, continuing there unto
the death of Solomon, and so received as it were supportation in his Treasons:
Yet it was the revolt of the ten Tribes, and the curse which branded Salomons
Idolatry, made Israel rebel against Rehoboam, and settled this Servant in his
Masters Throne: Although as Herodotus reports, that Harpagus Medus (after
Astiages had with great immanity murdered his Son) fled unto Cirus into
Persia, in hope of revenge, and so set the East and whole Asia in combustion:
Yet alas he only made hauock of his Country, and brought a stranger to
possess both the Monarchies.

If you ouerlooke the story of Hannibal, and would know, what entertainment
he had with Prusias King of Bithinia, you shall find him a miserable
spectacle of deiection, and that he only opened him the doors of death,
scarce affording him leisure to enter, before he was delivered into the hands
of scorn, according to their intention to lead him captive to Rome. Look
upon Pompeis miseries, who fled unto Ptolomy his supposed friend: but to what
end? Even to be brought to the house of slaughter, for fear of the preuailer:
What could Cleopatra avail her Anthony, or Lepidus, Sestus Pompeius, and
infinite others, sufficiently shroud themselves under foreign shades, when
the greater clouds were thickened to rain down shewres of deuastation, upon
their heads? and Octauius held up his head in the turbulent Sea of those civil
wars. And thus could I send you into the wild fields of instances
(especially concerning traitors, who were all choked with this Machiuillian
Position of admitting the Treason, but not suborning the Traitors) did I not
purpose to disclaim an uncivil uncovering the hoary head of Antiquity, and
diuulge this Principle, that there is no confidence in Princes, further then
the reuolts of others may second their own business, and the private quarrels
of a kingdom weaken themselves for a strangers admission, which yet must be
done by the factions, and coadiutements of the same Nation: Therefore I stand
amazed at the fanaticall hopes of diverse Spirits in our nation, that in those
days relied upon the supportation of Spain, and are still confident on the
blessings and cursings of the Pope, especially his ridiculous excommunicating
of Princes, now laughed at through the World; when they cannot afford me one
example, neither domestic, nor foreign; neither obsolete or modern; neither
divine nor profane, of any subject stepping awry into the by-waies of
rebellion or insurrection, that was established by a foreign Prince, except
that Prince (as I said before) proiected by such a bridge to transport his own
power for his own ends, and private satisfaction; But I would feign disclaim
any uncivil opening the graves of the Dead; and content my self with
displaying the colors of time, not yet elapsed from our own memories.

When the children of that worthy Edmond Ironside fled into Hungary from that
prevailing greatness of Canutus, I do not read of their triumphant return,
nor other establishment against that brave Dane, till the factions of England
broke out into flames of their private reuenges. When Henry the second had
crowned his son King of England, and that the impatient young man could not
endure his own Father in the competition, the Story says, the Prince with his
brethren fled into France, but how they returned; how they prospered; and how
they were supported, it is lamentable one way to report, and remarkable
another way to relate. In that deplorable business of Edward the second, when
his wife and son presumed on the assistance of the French King; I hope it was
not that power which established the young Prince, but the authority of
Mortimer that suppressed the misled King: When Henry the fourth prevailed,
Queen Isabel fled to her own brother, about the restoring of Richard 2. but
to what purpose? To bemoane her remediless griefs, and return, (if ever she
did return) without suppliment of sufficient assistance: The Earl of
Richmond, though afterward Henry the seventh, in the confused times of the
Yorkest preuailings, went into Britain, and so into France, but how he had
like to have been served, Peter Landoise the Secretary, and the Kings gold
could then have vnueiled the corruption of either, and when that Fortune led
him by the hand, to pace out the measures of victories, I hope it was no French
power, but English Friends and the Justice of Divine providence, which seated
him so happily in the Throne of greatness: How Perkin Warbeck, for all his
exhaled vapouring, went forward assisted by the Scottish policy, Flemmish
credulity, and inueterat malice of the Duches of Burgundy, against the house
of Lancaster, our stages of London, have instructed those which cannot read:
How the Earl of Westmerland, and numbers of English fugitives, have been
entertained abroad, some ouerthrown with calamitous desperation, some colluded
with the incantations of Friars and religious miracles, some distracted with
guiltines of Conscience, some transfounded with ambitious prosecutions, and
some preuaricated with an outward glory of Military profession, all men can
discover with repining eyes, or else let them ouerlooke a well compacted
breuiary to the same purpose, discoursing of the entertainment of English
fugitives beyond the Seas.

In the heat of our Enmity with Spain, Don Antonio King of Portingall flies
under the covert of a Princely protection, which to the admiration of the World
so expanded it self, that we brought him to the gates of Lisbone, but were
deceived with his presumptuous weakness, and ouer-credulous information:
Somewhat near the same account, another personating the King Sebastian,
supposedly slain in the fields of Barbary, astonished Florence and Venice,
with many prevailing probabilities of his life, but the King of Spain was in
the strength of a new possession, and the Italians too fearful to raise up a
Spirit they knew not how to conjure down again: If you would commiserate the
misfortunes of Stukely, I could Catalogue all his proceedings, and relate, that
the best glory of his entertainment, both with the King of Spain and the
Pope, consisted in some poor mercenary allowances, and when it was at the
highest, to flourish only with the titular dignity of the Marquess of
Dubline: but alas it wanted the essential parts and proppes of such a
business, Men* and Treasure, so that I may very well conclude against all such
exhalations, and infatuated men, with the significant Poet, Non ideo debet
pelago se credere, si qua
audet in exiguo ludere cimbalacu.


What say you to Antonio de Peers? for whom the wars of Aragon burst forth
into the reproach of seditious reuolts, and tumultuary disobedience? was he
not a while suffulciated amongst us! until those unlooked for conditions of
peace, hung down the heads of many military and noble minded English, sending
him to put his confidence in God, for the Princes of the World had failed him:
You have heard how the Duchy of Millane was as it were dilacerated with
troubles, and posted over from perplexity to perplexity, until the Emperor
Charles the fifth made it a meritorious act, to secure it under the strength of
his protection: but alas! he quickly left them staggering in their weakness,
and widened his own embraces to hug them warm for himself, and keep them
close to the Majesty of Spain. What say you to the Duke de Maine, and many of
that French League; how did they excruciat themselves, to be shouldered aside
from their expectation of foreign coadiutement? and when they had labored to
hide themselves in the Reeds of the Archdukes Pooles, yet were they feign to
make themselves clean again, by a contrary submission in the springs of their
own Country, assuring the malcontents of their combination, that no Prince
will hazard the peace of his Country, and Treasure of his Commonwealth, for
any foreign Subject living, unless as in many places before, the project is
contrived for their own glory or benefit.

I could begin again, with the unnatural distractions of the Wars
between Lancaster and York, when Queen Margaret the Virago of her time, and
her faction fled both into Scotland and France, but with what comforts of
supportation there, and relief at home, the Catastrophes of her husband and
son can delineate her misfortunes, and her own dismission out of England be
a sufficient warning to all disastrous Princes, especially seditious Subjects,
neither to trust their own strength, and friends in unjustifiable proceedings,
lest with Phaetons wilfulness, they find the Suns horses too too headstrong
for their managing, nor be too confident in the best adversity on the
presidiary helps of a Stranger, if once the business tend to draw an Army
into the field, and as it were to pull off the Gates of another Majesty over
the hindges: But of all other, the history of Tirone and Terconell, is most
lamentable, and remarkable, who while I was in Italy passed by Millane to
Rome, but in such a manner, as if Zedechias eyes were put out, and the Princes
of Judah carried captive to Babylon before the Monarch of the East: for his
entertainment with Spain was no better then in a common Inn at Milbane, with
a common trick to grace and flatter him with a foolish title of the Prince of
Ireland, and at Rome he was the subjects of Charity, and had only a poor
suppliment from some special Cardinals: yet because I have been a spectator
of this flourishing Tree, like the Chaldeans vision, and saw his blasting and
fall of Leaves, as the Fig Tree cursed by our Savior, give me leave* to be
beholding to Mr Cambdens compendious discourse, and with some additions of my
own, set him thus on the Stage of fearful admiration.

Thus much by way of Introduction. The Story follows.
THE HISTORY OF THE EARL of Tirone.
I Will here desist from any dilations of Irish business of old, or mention of
the great Oneale, who, as they say, before the coming of Saint Patrick
possessed Vlster, and most parts of Ireland, shining as the Sun of the same,
until the conquest from England obscured his light, and taught his barbarous
immanity another manner of obedience, and lesson of submission to a greater
Majesty, by which occasion this ambitious family was in a manner suppressed,
and lost that seeming luster, where with it graced the North of Ireland, yea
the whole Island, lying close to the shore, and not daring once to launch forth
into the Ocean of turbulent dissension, or refractary contesting with England,
until Edward de Bruise of Scotland proclaimed himself King of Ireland. Then
Douenaldus Oneale impatient of such indignity, launched forth by degrees into
the Channel of a new disturbance, and held up his head, as presuming on his
own Greatness equal to Bruses, and so in his letters and submission to the
Pope, accustomed the titles of heir of Ireland, King of Vlster, and one of the
sons of the mother Church: But that trouble appeased, these new Kings were
separated, and their united Greatness even in their posterity disioynted,
until again, that implacable contention between the two Families of York
and Lancaster, not only deformed the prosperity of England, but according to
the prevailing of factious Greatness, sent over diverse Governors, their
particeans into Ireland, who still temporizing with the strongest party, and
contriuing for their private, lest the general cause at random, and were
indeed unable to redact to any uniformity of government the disparity of Irish
obedience, and so gave way unto this ambitious, insulting, and rude people to
hold up their heads, and advance themselves, as high as their own titles, the
law Tanist, and liberty of nature could dignifie them.

Whereupon Harry Oneale the son of Oenus or Eugenius, matched himself with the
daughter of Th. Earl of Kildare, and his son Con More, or great Con, married
the daughter of Gerald Earl of Kildare, his own mothers Niece, whereby united
to the flourishing colors of the Geraldines, which many years had been
displayed in Ireland, and swelled with the fullness of a most vberant family,
they began (besides a strange elation of their spirits) with a tyrannous
suppression of their own Nation, and this Con More despised all titles of
either Prince* Duke, Marquess or Earl in respect of the name of Oneale: To
this Con succeeded another Con, surnamed Banco, or Lance, whose inueterate hate
against the English was such, that he cursed his posterity if either they
learned the language, sowed any wheat, or builded houses: This man's greatness
bred him envy in the Court of England, and according to the misery of all
times, there wanted not private whisperers, yea flatterers of Princes, by whose
suggestion that famous King Henry the eight was jealous of his power,
especially when it was corroborated by that factious house of Kildare, whose
story alone is of worthy memory, and affords so many excellent observations,
that I wish them folded up, as it were in one carpet, to be spread abroad with
hansomnesse for our delight and understanding.

But when the strength of our armies, and fortune of the wars had both
ouerawed their weakness, and reduced to good order those dangerous enemies,
bringing them into the school of correction for their misdemeanors, and
reformation for their inciuility: This Con was compelled to prostrate himself
before the Majesty of England, and so disclaimnig the title of Oneale, by
Letters Patent was created Earl of Tirone, his eldest son Matthew (though
suspected a Bastard) Baron of Dunganon, and all his Family, as it were
incorporated to the new obedience of the King: This Matthew until the age of
fifteen year, was imputed the son of a Smith in Dundalk, whose wife being
Oneales Concubine, did at the time of death, according to the custom of
Ireland, present him with this son, whom Oneale did not only receive with
gladness, but accepted him as his own, yea preferred him before his other
children to his titles, and possessions.

But Johannes or Shane Oneale, his son by a lawful wife, took it in such
indignity, that making a strong faction against his father, he not only
supplanted his brother Matthew, cutting off his head, but tormented the old Con
with many unnatural assaults, and violent excursions, depopulating his
territories, killing his accomplices, banishing his auxiliaries, and at last
brought him with untimely grief unto his grave, and all the country to be
affrighted with his tyranny. For he not only stepped forward more gloriously,
then his other ancestors, proclayming himself the great Oneale, but with
several expeditions contracted the love and observation of the other
Provinces, insomuch that many Rebels both of Conach, Meths, and Munster
assisted him in the prosecution of Mathews children, amongst whom Brian
(falling into the hands of Maudonel Totan) was cruelly murdered: Hugh and
Cormach were under English protection, and hardy preserved, which fell out so
crosly against Shanes expectation, and disastrous to his rebellious
presumption, that with a loathsome savageness, and traitrous conspiracy he
deformed the beauty of Irelands peace, and made hauock in a strange manner of
her prosperity, to which insolency and violent rage of prevailing, Sir Henry
Sidney, L. Justice of Ireland, in the absence of T. Earl of Sussex Lord
Lieutenant made opposition, and cast such blocks in the way, that his fury was
somewhat rebated, and a Cataplasme of restraint applied; and when there was no
remedy but cutting and fearing the vlcerous flesh of this putrified body of
Rebellion, by force of Arms, he not only propulsed the indignity, lashing
the sides of these proud Treasons with the stripes of a reuengefull hand, but
brought this insulting Lord on his knees, and made him confess the superiority
of Englands Majesty.

But first by way of expostulation, the matter was disputed with this Shane,
how he durst presume to cast, as it were a defiance into the face of Englands
Government, and put on his Iearean wings to fly higher, then his own Feathers
would warrant him. He answered very peremptorily, that he was the true, and
lawful heir of Con Oneale, as issuing from a worthy wife and of a noble
house, whereas Matthew was the Son of a Smith in Dondalck, and only foisted
in to overthrow the families of Oneale, which he neither would nor could be a
Pathick unto, as for the Kings Letters patents affording Con the honor of a
Coronet, and title of Earl, a cunning way to extenuate his worth, and
greatness in his country, it was apparent, that Con had no interest, but for
term of life, nor could without the consent of the Lords, and Dinastas of
Vlster, transfer another right into the Kings hands: Besides, such was the
ancient glory of his Family, that the true heir must be certified by the
Oath of Twelve Men, which in Mathews case failed, and therefore was the nullity
of them very conspicuous, and all such proceedings of England against him
worthily frustrated, but concerning himself, he had approbation both from God
and Man, as the lawful Son of a loving Wife, and was confirmed by the law
Tanist, according to the suffrages of the people, and several applauses of the
Families of Vlster, and for his since progression, he never admitted of other
thought, then to maintain the ancient glory of his unmatchable House, nor
usurped other jurisdiction, then his Ancestors by many Presidents, and apparent
records had formerly exercised, and confirmed without contradiction, and to
which, the other Kings of England had graciously consented, and most
indulgently protected them.

Notwithstanding all this, he ran a contrary course to former protestations,
and in the violent race of rebellion, plunged himself, to his utter extirpation
and confusion, as by the sequel may appear: For first he audaciously
suppressed O Realy, and quarrelling with Callogh O Donel, defeated his
accomplices, tauished his wife, imprisoned himself and children, deuasted his
Castles, usurped his inheritance, and like the King of Vlster indeed proceeded
with all imperiousness, and malicious insulting over his inferiors: but as
soon as Thomas Earl of Sussex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, prepared our
English forces to rebate his pride, and reduce the other Countries, he a
little moderated his ambitious courses, and a while procrastinated his former
resolutions, wherein the persuasion of Gerard Earl of Kildare his Cousin, whom
Queen Mary had restored, was so effectual, that he retired into England, and
in all suppliant manner abiected himself before the Council, with promises
and strange protestations, not only of being a true subject, but an
entertayner of Ciuility, and fashionable order, both in life and habit: the
hope whereof dismissed him home again, and like a cunning strumpet,
insinuating with the good opinion of a new deceived Friend, he began
reasonably well, shut his ears against the Syren-like temptations of his
Bardes and Rimers, undertook to hear the controversies of his people,
relieved the wants of the distressed. In a word, demeaned himself with a noble
kind of moderation in Peace, and when there was cause of War, expulsed the
Scots of Vlster, and cut off the head of James Mac-Connell their captain, and
principal occasion of that Innovation.

In these sweet passages of peace and quietness, he continued a while, and
the poor churl thought he beheld a fair shining Planet in a perspicuous
Heaven, growing proud of such an alteration, that he now might complain of
received injuries, and obtain redress for insufferable wrongs: But the better
sort finding him ouer-insolent to endure, and misdoubting a project against all
their estates and dignities, complotted to overthrow him, suggesting matter
against him, and so ordered the business, that Mac-Guier Lord of Fermanagh came
in person to Sir Henry Sidney, by this time Lord Deputy, to implore his
assistance, for the restrayning, or if you will, suppressing this usurping King
of the North, which Shane Oneale took so despitefully, and apprehended with
such indignation, that drunk with rage, he became insensible of reason, and
forgetting his allegiance with all the former fair promises of loyalty, he
prosecuted Mac-Guier at his return, with fire and sword, besieged Armagh,
demolished the Church, destroyed the buildings, and came to Dondalk, with
purpose to ruin the Country, but was a while intercepted by a worthy
expedition of Sir Will. Sercefield Mayor, and the Citizens of Dubline, I might
add the power of the Country, and the mustred forces of the English Irish
about Sordes and Tredagh.

By this time are the royal arms of the State spread abroad, and the Lord
Deputy, after he had shipped 7. companies of Foot, and a troop of Horse for
Logh-foile under the command of Sir Ed. Randoll, set forward in person toward
the North with the rest of the Army, which when Shane had intelligence of (as
what could be done, which some or other made him not acquainted with?) and that
he understood there was a purpose with all advantages to press him both
behind and before, he raised himself toward the Derry, and with great
expedition brought the matter to deciding, so that many skirmishes were but as
it were preparatiues to that maine encounter, which to his perpetual renown
cost Sir Ed. Randoll his life, and brought Shane to confusion: For very quickly
all his purposes were disanulled, his forces weakened, his Rebels dissipated,
and the whole strength of his proiects infringed; so that despayring to
reintegrate his estate, he determined a strange alteration (O that man dare
presume of any thing, being subject to such an alteration!) with a Halter about
his neck, to submit to the Deputy: but diuerted from so base a course by the
advice, and courageous spirit of his Secretary, he made trial of a new
confederacy with Alexander Oge and the Scots, who were resident and rebellious
in the Claude Boys.

But first, as an introduction of peace, he released Surleboy, the brother of
Alexander, whom he had long detained in prison: and thus presuming on this new
combination with the enforced Odonnels wife, and some few others, he is
welcomed into the tent of Alexander, and for the present entertained as the
very Prince of the North, or King of Vlster: but after extraordinary drinking,
and ouer-liberall carouses, certain unkindness and unfortunate repetitions
began between them about his other brothers death, and the honor of his
sister, whom Shane had formerly married, but despightfully refused: Wine
overcame reason, reason thus entangled was subjected to confusion of words,
words increased rage; and rage induced revenge; so that Alex* Oge, and Mac.
Gilaspic his brother took advantage of the time and these occasions, which was
performed with such inueterate malice, and offensive digressions, that Shane
was set upon, ouermastered, and with many wounds slain: that his Secretary was
cut in pieces, his wife or rather Concubine surprised, and the company
dispersed: that the Rebels of the North were utterly subverted, these Scots
made a way to their admission and pardon, and by consequence the peace of
Vlster restored.

This business thus settled and determined, a Parliament was called in Ireland,
in which Shane Oneale with all his followers was proscribed, the name of Oneale
interdicted, the Lands and territories of the North or Vlster incorporated to
the Crown of England, and all occasions of innovation removed, had not Turlogh
Leignogh brothers son to Con More Oneale assumed the title: a man of
declining age, and more quiet then the rest of his name, suspecting indeed,
that according to their law Tanist, either Shane Oneales sons, or Hugh Baron
of Dunganmon might intercept his claim, and prevent his right, as he supposed,
which compelled him to this audacious enterprise, contrary to the edict and
prohibition of the same: notwithstanding, to salve the sore of his suspected
loialty, he kept correspondency with us in all his other actions, and in her
Majesty's service, not only encountered Odonell, but overthrew the Scots
Ilanders, and at last destroyed Alexander Oge, the murderer of Shane Oneale.

All this while Hugh the son of Matthew stood on his guard, and lived warily:
sometimes under the security of his own faithful followers, sometimes under
the trust of English protection, (for so in his younger time he trooped in the
streets of London with sufficient equipage, and orderly respect) and sometimes
as a Soldier he commanded a company of horse under the Deputy in Munster,
against the Earl of Desmond, with a pension beside of one thousand mark a
year out of the Exchequer, which orderly proceedings with the trust conceived
of his loialty drew the bow for him, wherewith he hot the mark of his own
aim, and so by new Leters-Patents, having diverse restraints and reseruations,
he was admitted to his Grandfathers titles, and inheritances, nor should it
seem that Turlogh Leignogh stomached his advancement, but rather upon hope of
his virtues, which gave a luster to his actions, surrendered his titles and
Lordships into his hands: But oh the ambition of men? or inconstancy of
manners? these proceedings with him in this fair and gentle manner, made him
either proud of his own greatness, or presumptuous that the State was afraid
to displease him, or superstitious after the Priests had insorcered him. For
presently against the Queens absolute prohibition, this new Tirone takes upon
him the title of Oneale, excusing the fact, lest some rebellious spirit
according to their warlike custom of maintaining that Character in their
Family, might assume the same, taking advantage of his negligence, protesting
to disclaim the honor, so he might not be urged by oath: and from hence arose
the first motive of Tirones vnsted fastness.

At this instant was that memorable defeat, and admirable discomfiture of the
King of Spaines formidable Armado, or if you will according to Mendozas own
words (then Embasdor Leiger in Paris) invincible Navy, whereby in their return
by Scotland and Ireland, many of them perished, but the better sort were kindly
intertaind by Tirone after the manner of Irish Hospitality, and unexpectedly
welcome, considering, that any relief to men in distress, and cast on a
strange shore by Shipwreck, is as Balm and Oil powered into wounds: In
requital whereof such a Loome of mischief was set on work, that at the last
the cloth was wouen of his corruption, and folded together to keep his
treasons warm in his own bosom, till a strong supposed, and yet presumptuous
hand, spread it abroad to his utter destruction, and shameful disgrace by
reason of his deformed filthiness.

For when then these straggling Spaniards perceived his natural inclination to
ambitious willingness, concerning the maintaining some turbulent faction in
Ireland, and demonstration of a stirring spirit for the glory of his Ancestors,
they quickly added fuel to the fire, and with all the baits of prosperity and
incantations to flattery choked his loialty, and cast dust into the eyes of
his faithfulness: Some promising, that their great Master should recompense
his humanity, and noble respect: Some repining at their misfortune, laid many
slanders on the shoulders of our country: Some under color of religious
obedience assured, that the Pope himself should gratify him: Some more
dangerously cunning crept within him by that imposturing art of commendation,
inferring he was more worthy of a Crown, then a subjects prostitution, and
some more plainly with demonstratiue reasons led him as it were by the hand to
the chair of presumption, and possibility, that it might be so, if he durst
attend his own fortunes, and prosecute the times in their several changes: By
which occasion this man's irresolute love to his Prince and country was first
enuenomed and tainted: Afterward it rancled more and more in his declining from
himself and first soundness by contracting a league with Spain. Thirdly, it
swelled apace with the oath and allegiance of many followers, and particians,
to coadiute him in any enterprise whatsoever; and last of all, it restred
incurably in consenting (and putting the same in practice) to be an opposite
to the government of England, and a famous Rebel against the peace of our
country, which yet was neither so cautelously disposed of, nor firmly
compacted, but Hugh ne Gauclock, his brother, fearing the fearful consequence
of the downfall of his house, discovered the same, for which the Earl found a
time to strangle him, colourably prosecuting the Actors, that durst lay hands
on any of the blood of Oneale: but alas it served not his turn: For not only
this barbarous Fratricide, but all his other refractary courses were laid open
to the peering eyes of Englands Majesty: but such was his prevailing fortune,
that upon his reasonable iustifications, and seeming penitency, our gracious
Elizabeth not only remitted those offenses with favor, but continued him in
his Greatness with Honor.

In this manner he moved awhile in the highest orb of prosperity, and from our
English supportation commanded his country, as a Prince of the North, and
except an open displaying of the colors of Rebellion, performed, what he
durst, and durst do any thing, which tended not to manifest treason, and
dangerous innovation. For not long after, under color of corroborating the
peace of his country and insinuation with some English affinity, he made Sir
Samuel Bagnols sister believe, that the great Oneale of Ireland was captiuated
to her love, and in which, if the time could have served, he would have showed
himself as brave and complete an Amorist, as the formallest Courtier in
England: To this the Lady seemed no great opposite, only with some show of
modesty depending on her brother, she referd the success to his approbatio^,
who some what too stubborn, interposed as it were a negative, not without
exprobation of the barbarous customs of the North of Ireland, which Tirone
interpreted disgracious to his exaltation, and finding no other remedy to
appease his wilfulness, in a manner by force of arms took her to his wife;
whereupon he was denied her dowry, and that exasperated his displeasure: to
which when the Deputy added the suppressing of Mac Mahond his neighbor, I am
afraid it exulcerated his loialty. For when he perceived he was forbidden the
title, to the abasing of his Family, and saw his inheritance distributed to the
impouerishing his estate, he quickly startled up, and many displeasures
discovered themselves against his former establishment, so that the Earl, by
occasion of retchlesse booke-keepers cast up his untoward account in this
manner:

First, that the State had a purpose to suppress the flourishing eminence both
of himself, and all the Lords of the North: Next; that they should be
compelled to alter their Religion, and disclaim the Popes usurped authority
over the Church: Thirdly, that the Marshall Sir Henry Bagnoll had not only
prosecuted him with despightfull and malignant enmity, but justified Articles
of Treason against him: Fourthly, that he was denied the fruits of his own
labor, and honor of his industry, after he had (as he objected) with the loss
of much blood, and expending of great Treasure of his own, reducted the
Province of Vlster: And last of all, that Sir William Fitz-William Lord Deputy,
had not only given way to the malice of the Marshall, but possessed the Court
of England with many untruths against him; all which were quickly capitulated
to the Dinastas of the North, his kinsmen, favorites, and dependents, and they
as quickly commiserated his discontents, and merely out of inueterate hate
against us all, contracted themselves to the maintaining the Romish Religion,
and obedience to the house of Oneale, keeping yet an open correspondency with
us, though in covert their hearts (as the Lapwing cries farthest from her
nest) stored up as it were all prouocations of disloyalty, lying yet in wait
for some aduantagious excuse, if they once were discovered.

The first that brake the Ice of their ill contrived Rebellions was Mac Guier,
a turbulent young man, crafty, and reuengefull, who seduced by Gauranus a
Priest, confirmed Primate of Ireland by the Pope, invaded Conagh, and in
insulting manner usurped the Country as he went, with full confidence, that
the holy Fathers blessings should in a manner make security, and success
attend them: But the doors of Heaven were barred on the inside, excluding them
as yet from any entrance, and the virtue of Sir Richard Bingham so
counterchecked Mac Guiers fortunes, that he fled discomfited, the Primate
slain, and all his forces dispersed: Yet after a while the scattered limbs of
Pelops are gathered together, and as if Anteus should recover by touching the
Earth, Mac Guier makes a stronger party, and with some deceivable beginnings,
goes into more open Action, against whom the Earl of Tyrone himself was
compelled to join with the Marshall his only suspected enemy, and received a
wound in that service: But his heart, as it should seem, was worser hurt with
private discontentments: For you must understand that before he set forward in
her Majesty's service, order was taken for the safe keeping of Shane Oneales
children, whose delivery he had denied to the State, inferring by way of
complaint, that the Lord Deputy and Marshall picked nothing but quarrels
against him, and by new occsiaons of unkindness determined to supplant him.

Now is Sir William Fitzwilliam recalled, and Sir William Russell constituted
Deputy in his stead, to whom of his own accord the Earl of Tyrone came to
submit himself, with all those promises, that might induce a generous spirit
to believe him: but the Marshall Bagnoll then present audaciously articulated.
1 That he countenanced Mac Guier and the Primats Rebellion: 2. That he
supported Odonell, and the rest of that coniuration: 3. That by the advice of
Cormach Mac Baron, his Bastard Son Con had coadiutement from him in the
deuastation of Monaghan, and besieging of Inigkellin: 4. That he corrupted the
Faith and Obedience of the Captains of Kilulto and Kilwarney: 5. And that all
his protestations were counterfeit and dissimulatory fictions. These were
heinous objections, and indeed divided the Council: For the Deputy and
Marshall would have detayned him prisoner, but the greater part either by vain
fear, or corrupted respects, interceded until a more fitter opportunity, to
whom as men better acquainted with the affairs of Ireland the Lord Deputy
hardly condiscended.

So Tyrone returned home, and indeed turned as the Dog to his vomit, to his
former impressed resolutions to disturb the State, if the State disturbed him:
whereupon understanding of an Army raised in England with new supplies of 1300.
Low Country Soldiers against him, whom that worthy and renowned Sir John
Norris by the famous name of General Norris brought out of Britany, he not
only stood on his guard, but mustred his followers (by this time reasonably
disciplined in the open fields, and whilst the English went against Balishanon
and Belike, Castles at the further end of Logh Erne, he approached Black-water
Fort, and coming on the sudden, had it surrendered into his hands, but not
with that confidence, that either he relied on the security of the place, or
power of his own Army: whereupon he very politiquely one way attempted the
Earl of Kildare to support him against the manifest injuries of the Deputy and
Marshall, and another way promised the Earl of Ormond and Sir Henry Wallop
Treasurer, to remain within the limits of justifiable obedience: To this he
added the vnclasping the book of these occurrences to Sir John Norris General
of the Army, imploring his commiseration, and as it were begging at his hands,
that he might not be enforced to such exorbitant actions, as necessity and
the law of Nature would and could contriue; but the former Letters the Marshall
intercepted, and these too General Norris quite suppressed, which he sparingly
misliked, though it fell not to his turn absolutely to find fault withal:
But when Tyrone understood of these calumnious and dangerous proceedings
against him, he was put quite out of patience, exclayming, that his
destruction was now on the web, and in the hands of a pestilent workman, yea
his adversary wanted only means to his will to contriue his utter destruction
indeed.

Notwithstanding all this; he put on new wings to his deceivable hopes, and
turmoyled all the Kingdom with inficious Rebellion, whereupon he was
publicly proclaimed Traitor, and enemy to the Queen, which he professed
accordingly with all correspondency of an adversary. For in Vlster his Army
consisted of a 1000. Horse, and 7000. Foot. In Conach he had (or if you will, O
Roorck and the Conners kept them together at his disposing) 200. Horse, and
2400. Foot: In Lease and Ophaly, the number was as uncertain, as their
dispositions, being sometimes violent Rebels, and anon submissiue Subjects. In
Munster they lived so dispersed, that the Governor found it work enough to
find them out, and follow them: The English forces under Sir John Norris
equalled their greatest Armies, but nothing was done worthy of so great a
Commanders name, and soldiers renown. For under color of private displeasure
between the Deputy and him, many bad offices were performed, and the time
spent to small purpose in parlies and conferences, affording Tirone such
leisure, that he contracted with Spain, and expected from thence continual
supplies.

But before the matter came to martial deciding, Sir Henry Wallop Treasurer at
wars, and Sir Robert Gardner chief Justice of the Kings Bench, men laid down
in the balance of integrity, wisdom and experience, were deligated to hear
the grieuances of these great Lords of the North, enforced to a defensive
war, as they intimated, and yet obscured by the name of traitors against the
State: The commiserate hearing of these compulsions, and unquiet discourses
from so dangerous a faction, returned our English Commissioners with some
amazement at their oratory, and cunning insinuation, whereby they might have
excused diverse things, if by a wrong course they had not incurred the danger of
contesting with Princes, yea their royal Sovereign, whose incensed Majesty
could not endure such opposition: whereupon the truce is ouerpassed, and the
Trumpet of defiance sounded through the Kingdom, foreshewing, that the
Schoolmaster of reformation was at hand, and Sir John Norris as Lord General
of the Army in the absence of the Deputy, ready to display the colors of
correction, but it should seem the Deputy would needs have a share in the
glory of this business. For contrary to his first appointment, he hasted
apace, and united his troops with Sir John Norris, and so both together
attended the success of the matter, and prosperity of the time.

The beginning was a fortunate terrifying him at Armagh, and pressing him so
closely, that the Earl left Black-water Fort, dismantled the Town
thereabouts, fiered some houses at Dungannon his own principal seat, and
secured himself in his chiefest fastness, winning much time by this politic
retreat, but we unexperienced in those dangerous places of his boggs and woods,
with only proclaiming him Traitor in his country, and leaving Garrison in
Armagh, returned, which Tirone audaciously interpreted to his own advantage,
repining at nothing more, then our fortification in Monaghan: Thus was our
business kept awhile out of the running current of applause. For the Deputy
and the General of the Army grew to some impatient contradicting one another,
as if there had been a fault committed, which was questionless to be imposed
on one of their shoulders: wherefore the Deputy commanded, or if you will,
wished S. I. Norris to prosecute the service in Vlster, whilst he retired to
Dubline to provide for the peace of the other Provinces, but it prevailed
little to the lifting up the head of the maine body. For he performed nothing
worthy the glory of his former reputation or dignity of so eminent a place: But
whether the emulation of the Deputy, or favoring the Earl to whom he was as
much inclined with respect, as the Deputy transported with hate: Or whether he
suspected the business in hand, the nature whereof, with the baseness and
intricate obscurity of the country, was so contrarious to the military
proceedings elsewhere, and spent all men's spirits, without so much as the
memory of manhood: or whether in inclination of fortune he began to stagger
from his first firmenes, which in a customary defect deals strangely with
such Commanders, sometimes heaping her favors and prosperous successes, anon
again withdrawing her happy hand, and by degrees extenuating both their
valor* fame, and judgment, I dispute not upon.

Only this I am sure of, that fair errors might lead them both: For the Deputy
by reason of Sir Henry Bagnols and some others despite, was brought to look
upon a very face of disloialty in Tirone, and Sir John Norris commiserated his
misfortune, as abused with dissimulatory submissiue letters, in which the Earl
was ready on his knees to any penitent prostitution, when yet underhand he
implored the aid of Spain, with warrantise, that if an Army were intended
against England, then to unite their forces: if only wars were proclaimed and
protraction used, then must the Catholic King supply them with men and money
whereupon O Roorck, Mac Williams, and others openly, and the Earl privately
subscribed to a certain instrument of Indenture, like ratification, giving yet
notice to the State of all these contracts, and determinations, to which was
added another parley with Sir John Norris, and Sir Geffery Fenton Secretary in
persons, full of very strange promises, and colluding protestations to run a
race of obedience and loyalty: all which accustomed Leuity he infringed,
laying imputation upon the discrepant humors of the Deputy and Lord General,
but especially, that his only enemy the Marshall was returned from England
with new forces, and inueterate malice against him.

Whereupon by way of Apology, he excused himself to the Council of England,
and urged many justifiable reasons (as he thought) for his discrepant
proceedings, to which it should seem their answer was both distasting, and
fearful unto him. For as it were exasperated rather then forewarned, he
presently returned to his old courses, and taking great advantage of our
slacknesse, and ill prepared forces, spoiled the country, filled all the paces
with Rebels, Barrocaded the passages, and with military excursions ran an
uncontrollable journey of doing what he pleased through the North.

Thus was all Vlster and most part of Conach (excepting certain Garrisons) at
his absolute command, until the Lord Borrough 1597. a man of a great spirit and
quick capacity was sent Deputy into Ireland, from whose worth some auspicious
expectation seemed to comfort us, and new endeavors in a manner to warrant new
fortunes: This son of Mars quickly pulled off the clogs of delay, and within
two months rolled the stone of Tirones unquietness, making way with great
industry and virtue into his country, fortifying the Fort of Black-water, and
discovering this secret, that neither his Boggs, Glinns, Woods, Mountains,
Paces, Confederats, or any power of Ireland, or Irish coadiutors could hide him
from the searching eyes of England. Besides, if we would undertake an
industrious prosecution against him, it was neither Spain with her Gold, nor
the Pope with his Fulminations against our Country, could secure him. For the
far reaching arms of our people would for a need pull him out of the Center
of the Earth: and thus accordingly even at the first skirmishes were his forces
dissipated, and the best troops disranked: but as my Lord was giving God
thanks with a warlike solemnity, a sudden Alarm set them anew to work, and
Henry Earl of Kildare with the Gent. Volentiers had the Fortune to put him
again to flight, which yet yielded not so full a satisfaction, as it might
have done, because my Lord lost his brother in Law Francis Vaughan and Captain
Turner Sergeant Mayor, besides the Earl of Kildare to the sorrow of his heart
saw two of his brethren wrapped up in the Bed of blood, all men of worthy
expectation, and extraordinary Merit.

Thus is a way made into his Country, and Black-water Fort strengthened with
new trenches, not without some ramparts, and Caffamates, which the enemy so
repined at, that between hope, fear, and shame, they resolved to dismantle
it, had not the Lord Deputy opened more larger embracings, and with a new
manner of wrestling resolved to lay him on the ground irrecouerably: but hinc
illae lachrimae! as he was treading the measures of prosperity, an untimely
discord of Death sounding Music deceived him of hope, and us of him, whose
forwardnes and virtue with a little addition of experience, and solid
understanding himself, had no doubt effectuated this Herculian labor of
Irelands peace.

Now is Tyrone putting on his Icarean wings, and the Rebel with accustomed
Clamors taking advantage of this Interim, assaulted Black-water Fort, but
therein commanded that industrious Captain Th. Williams, who at the same
instant by mere valor, and resolution propulsed them, and many times after,
by patience and constancy endured all those mischiefs, where by a Soldier is
put to the test, and enemy makes demonstration of his hate and policy. For
when the Irish found themselves incapable of such a business, by way of
expugnation, or assault, they took another course by intercepting the passages
to famish them; which when the English understood, they were as resolute to
affront all mischances, as the enemy was violent in contriuing displeasures,
and so with noble steadfastness bare up a head against the stream of
sickness, and wants, eating Horses and Weeds, and if it had been possible,
the very dirt and stones.

In this time the government of Ireland was in the hands of the Earl of
Ormond, as Lieutenant General of the Army: the Lord Chancellor and Sir Robert
Gardner Justices, to whom the Earl of Tyrone by many dilatory Letters did lay
open all his grieuances, touching sparingly his breach of promise with Sir John
Norris, and all the effectual points of his disobedience, and refractary
courses: To these Letters he received answer, which he interpreted
displeasing rather then satisfactory, and so accordingly entered into further
Rebellious actions, pressing Black-water Fort again with a more dangerous
siedge, against whom the Lord Lieutenant and Justices aforesaid sent Sir Henry
Bagnoll the Marshall, his only reputed adversary, with sixteen Companies of
Foot, and four troops of Horse, who advancing forward more malicious then
fortunate, as ouerwrought by a predestined wilfulness, came to blows, and
according to the slippery footing of War, fell to a dangerous Skirmish, in
which Tyrone shouldred him with all his strength nigh unto Armagh, determining
as it were to punish his Envy, and supposed abuses against him, wherein it
should seem the Mistrisse of success (as we abuse Gods providence by the
Character of Fortune) was coadiutrix, and displayed all the malign
circumstances of revenge against us. For ere night decided the controversy, he
triumphed with a notorious victory, whereby in one hour the Marshall ended his
bravery, life, and enmity: nor could the Irish ever boast of a more conspicuous
triumph since the Conquest, or if you had rather have it so, since we first
curbed their immanity: For we lost fifteen Captains, and 1500. Soldiers,
over whom the manner of insulting was more barbarous then the accident
tyrannous.

Presently followed the surrendering of Black-water Fort, when the besieged saw
all relief debarred them, and heard, how Tyrone was proclaimed the deliverer
of his Country and Protector of the Catholic cause, seeming the very darling
of prosperity and delight of Bellona, wherein he proceeded accordingly, making
all the Kingdom witness his glory and renown. For he presently sent
Ouny-Mac Roory Oge, and Tirrill into Munster with four thousand Rebels,
against whom the Lord President Sir John Norris (having lost his brother by
sickness, or as some suppose, a disastrous Melancholy) with reasonable
equipage, and orderly attendance set nobly forward: but the enemy not
appearing, he retired to Corck, and dividing his Army into several Garrisons,
gave them liberty to take advantage of our wearisomnesse and impatience. For
presently they proceeded to all hateful courses of savage outrage, and after
James Fitz-Thomas a Rebel of that House was proclaimed Earl of Desmond, who
thereupon acknowledged Oneale his benefactor, and superior, they returned with
ambitious alacrity, and cheerfulness, and sent word into Spain of their
admirable successes, wherein Tyrone behaved himself so audaciously, that he
interdicted the peace of England, as if there had been a way opened unto an
easy conquest of the same, and the first step into Ireland would help them
up the degrees of a more illustrious glory, to which purpose the King of
Spain should not only be assured of the Popes blessing, but Oneales Fortunes
and assistance, yea the whole power of the Kingdom.

This was the lamentable estate of Ireland, when her Majesty taking pity of
her Orphan Country, substituted Robert Earl of Essex, whom the success of
Cales voyage, and many other memorable designs and prosecutions had worthily
renowned, her Lieutenant General of Ireland: But how he had formerly wound
himself into the good opinion of his Country, how England looked upon him as
a glorious son of comeliness and honor, how his forces, Treasure, and
Favors were extraordinary in this project of Ireland, how he proceeded in
this military race, how the applause of the people, and the greatest part of
the nobility attended him: How a sudden storm, as if some ominous sign from
Heaven presaged misfortune, intercepted his iollity even at his first setting
out of London: how landed in Ireland he began his business as
preposterously: How that brave Sir Coniers Clifford was abused by presumption,
and ouer-credulous opinion, that his bosom friend O Roorck would not have
proved such a Traitor, and so not only lost his life at the Curlews a boggy
Mountain by the Abbey of Aborle: but was inhumanely after the skirmish mangled,
and with great immanity cut in pieces: How the Earl of Ormond, and Sir Henry
Harington were surprised and taken prisoners by Harry Oge: Owny mac Roory, and
the sons of Feff mac-Heugh rebels united against the peace and flourishing
prosperity of Lemster: How he came to a private parley with Tyrone, and was
much affected by the Irish: How her Majesty rebuked him, and from incensed
indignation challenged both his loyalty, and the wisdom of the Council of
Ireland for a contrarious and untoward method of government, and prosecutions
in the North: How his glorious celebrating the feast of Saint George in the
City of Dubline, considering the times and turmoyles of the kingdom, was
imputed rather an ostentous bravery, then a necessary honor: How contrary to
expectation he comes into England after a private prohibition by her Majesty's
own Letters: How he was commanded to his own House, and his Offices
dispensed withal: How his sorrows multiplied: How the peoples love increased
either from a general commiserating of such men in distress, or particular
apprehension of his greatness, and worth: How his fortunes and Life ended: I
will leave to a Story of it self, yea if I might say so, to many Stories, in
which such infinite observations might be folded, that if a man durst or might
spread them abroad, all the passages should be laid open and exposed to
public ouerlooking, of the favor and disfauor of Princes, the dangers of men
insatiable of glory, the condition of Councillors, emulous of one another
greatness, the mutability and inconstancy of popularitie, the peril wherein
men plunge themselves, that dare presume to perpetrate unjustifiable actions,
and the misery, which an untimely death brings to a man projecting high
matters to himself. But to our Irish business again.

When my Lord of Essex troubles were published abroad and divulged in Ireland:
the Earl of Tirone with great indignation brake the truce of his Country,
raised his forces, mustred his Rebels, rumored the invasion of England by
Spain, and audaciously set open all the passages of war and defiance,
whereupon the Traitors increased both in pride and numbers, and those which
were mere Irish, expected their pristinate liberty: such again as had settled
their estates, either by purchase or gift of the Prince, began to misdoubt
themselves, when they perceived such a confluence and concurrence of tumultuary
business to the detriment of the Kingdom: yea, I am afraid they were without
all hope in their hearts, when Tirone proclaimed himself Protector of Ireland,
and Maintainer of the Catholic Religion: nor was this only titular, and a
formal trick of vain promises and flattering friends. For he proceeded
accordingly, imperiously managing all affairs under his government: the
rebellious he moderated, the weak supported, the strong confirmed, the
staggering reduced, the wilful punished, and (in a word) applied himself
altogether to the extirpation of the English: whereunto he was animated, by
assured intelligence of preparations in Spain, and the receiving a competent
treasure from thence. Nor wanted there certain indulgences and promises from
the Pope, to set his desire on a blaze: but when for a present he had received
an hollowed Phoenix plume, with Ixion that boasted of lying with Juno, being
yet deceived with the shape of a clowd, he presaged good fortune, and ran
away with full confidence of success, and the rather, because he remembered,
how Urban the third had sent King John a crown of peacockes feathers at his
designation, for the Lordship of Ireland.

Thus marched he over the Country, with extraordinary prevailing, and
unaccustomed pomp, for an Irish Commander, with new publications of his
regardable proceedings, and Princely confirmations. And to add fuel to that
fire, which in his absence was kindled in Munster, he went thither in person,
and under color of visiting a piece of the cross of Christ in Tiperary,
attempted further, sending Mac-Guior to forage the country, who chancing on Sr.
Warrham Selenger, fell to blows, and in gallant encounter, charged one another
so bravely, that with their staves they equally received their deaths wounds
through their bodies, which a while curbed Tirones headstrongness, and
peradventure was cause of his sooner retiring home, after he had celebrated
Mac-Guiors exequies: but in truth the advertisement of the Earl of Ormonds
coming against him with all the English forces rebated his first forwardness,
and made him suspect all was not so well as he wished: but yet animated by many
superstitious presages, and giving all credit to his Bards and Rimers, of which
sort of people, especially if I add the Priests, I will be bold to say thus
much, that they are the very bane and confusion of Ireland, living in such
obscenity and filthiness, that no Gentlewoman thinks herself happy without
them, and supposes it no disgrace even to be prostituted unto them: Insomuch,
that ill custom (besides the intolerable yoke of superstition, to which these
people are out of measure addicted) having got the vpperhand, these insorcering
wretches at marriages, feasts, births of children, contracts, burialls, and
peradventure all their lives time, challenge certain privileges, immunities
and gifts; yea, priuacies with the women, and imperious ouerruling the men: So
that as their families increase in mightiness, these damnable creatures
prosper in reputation, as if all blessings depended upon their incantations and
prayers, and no action could thrive without their crossings and sanctifying: So
that (in my conscience) the most of the rebels and strumpets amongst them, are
the bastards of these rogues and vagabonds: and all the treasons, which have
turmoiled our Nation, have received life and original from their imposturing
and persuasions.

By this time is Sr. Charles Blunt Lord Montioy confirmed Deputy of Ireland, on
whom long since the Queen had looked with respect for the same purpose: But
the Earl of Essex proposing to himself the managing of all military affairs,
somewhat covertly impugned the same, extenuated his experience in the wars,
and that he only had a view of some skirmishes in the Low Countries: Besides,
his spirit was not stirring enough to curb such a Nation, as given over much to
his book, and a kind of retired melancholy, rather fit for civil government,
then violent hurliburlies: All which wiped not yet out the print of her good
opinion; but she went forward in her choice, and made the election more
notable, because her own judgment affoorded sufficient reason of his merit:
only she proposed before him, by way of caution, my Lord of Essex wilfulness,
and in a manner presumption, practizing diverse things against her liking and
prescription, and so alike restrained his commission, and by word of mouth
commanded his charines and wisdom, concerning the knighting of men, which must
needs be vilipended, brought once to a community; as for any hindrances, by
the maleuolent aspect of single Councillors, she promised on her Princely
word, that she would be the Queen of her Kingdom, and no man should
contract a brow of mislike, or prevail in any secret information against him:
whereupon he was much comforted, and well hoped, that that enmity which was
whispered between Mr. Secretary and him, I mean Sr. Robert Cecill, might be
easily reconciled, and (as it were) like the swet of a man's brows wiped away
with a gentle hand, which accordingly came to pass. For when certain honest
men performed good offices between them, never man observed such a Counselor
of State, better than my Lord did him, nor such a greatness honored a person
in such an eminent place, then Mr. Secretary did my Lord: so that to their
dying days their friendship was indissoluble, and as they loved one another,
so both respected the glory of their country before one another.

Thus without any public ostentation, or great attendancy, in the month of
February 1600. he took his journey toward Ireland, and was welcomed to our
true-hearted English, as you see a famous Physician presented to a sick
patient, who has long expected his coming. For he found Ireland so desperate
languishing, that he rather feared her funerals then recovery, which must be
so at this instant, considering the very best did droop with despair, and the
worst insulted with pride: Tyrone passed and repassed without control, and the
Rebel had nothing in his mouth, but the Spanish Invasion, and that Tyrone
should be the Prince of their Country under the Catholic King: whereupon to
exasperate the new Deputy, and terrify him at the first, they gave an assault
to the suburbs of Dublin, and the Alarm rung even to the Castle, where my Lord
was resident, which indeed so much incensed him, that he resolved to intercept
his return out of Munster, whatsoever chanced; and so gathering together the
rest of the dispersed forces, and taking along such Gentlemen as came with him
out of England, he marched into Fereall (for you must consider the maine army
was with my Lord of Ormond in Munster) and determined to see the manner of
Tyrones returning home into his Country, but was prevented by the admirable
expedition he made. For certified of all our proceedings, not without some
ampliation of my Lords power and authority, as in all such cases it happens,
that new Governors are not only extolled, but an army of a thousand by poll,
shall be made two thousand by report, he quickly procured a shelter for the
storm which was threatened, and even ready to power upon him, and so taking the
way of Lease, and the skirts of Mead, posted into the North.

When my Lord Deputy was thus frustrated of his expectation, he returned to
Dublin, and after orderly consultation, concluded to send forces by sea to
Logh-Foile and Balishanon, as also to Logh-Erne, to visit Lease and Ophaly, to
restore Munster, and fortify Conach, which as they were designs of wonderful
consequence; so must as wonderful wisdom of men, and providence of God
effectuate the same, and bring to a happy period. Thus was all Ireland, like a
turbulent sea full of billows, even to the very shores, and the Rebel vexed
both Country and Inhabitants: the country was spoiled, ouerrunne, and in most
parts depopulated; insomuch that in diverse places, twenty mile together, not so
much as a bird appeared; the inhabitants were slain, ravished, enforced, and
robbed: insomuch that neither house, nor Church, except some few castles and
towns in special men's hands, remained upright: but were burnt, ruined, and
deuasted.

When my Lord Deputy (to make my first simile hold correspondency) felt the
pulses so strong of this disquieted body, and understood the state of the same
by outward and inward demostration: his principal care was, to reduce the
distemperature, and cool the heat, if it were possible, of this burning
fever; for which purpose he conferred with the Council, and after orderly
and provident furnishing his army with munition, garons, and several
provision: he determined in person, and with all speediness, sometimes the
only strength and life of all difficult enterprises, to encounter the enemy;
but especially to divert Tyrone from intercepting Sr. Henry Dockeray, at
Logh-Foile; and Sr. Matthew Morgan, at Balishanon: whereupon in the beginning
of May (an early time to bring an army into the field) he marched toward
Vlster, and pressed the Rebel with so many skirmishes, that they were
wonderfully dispersed, and against all expectation confounded: Thus had he
leisure, in the midst of June, to march back again into Lease, the only
refuge of the Rebels of Lemster, where with admirable success he prevailed
against that turbulent, cruel, and bloody young man Ony-Mac-Roory-Oge, the
chief of the family of O-more, who had so lately disturbed the peace of all
Munster; to whom, with other his most pestilent and impious confederates, did
our Deputy read a lesson of Justice, and taught rebellion other principles of
conformity, then either they were willing to learn, or had been before
orderly enstructed in: by which occasion Bellona began to give us better
entertainment, and already there appeared a declining of the others prosperity:
Thus was the God of battles propitious unto us, and the sun of comfort by
degrees chased away the foggy mists of despair and despite; so that every
man's heart was cheered, and they which held down their heads full low in the
time of mistrust and affliction, I mean the Irish-English themselves in the
pale, began to stand upright for joy, and flocked to the court in troops, to
welcome my Lord Deputy home, and applauded the prosperity of his attempts; yea,
to speak without flattery, to impute the happiness to his virtue and wisdom.

In the midst of this iollity, new supplies out of England gave more air to
success, which had been so long smoothered between malignant circumstances
of time, and ill conditions of men devoted to private ends. For this is most
certain, that in the uncertainty of our prevailing, when the government of
Ireland seemed laid at the stake, howeuer the better sort kept correspondency
with us, and professed a kind of glory in participating with our misfortunes,
yet did they underhand not only relieve Tyrone, but contracted for their own
security, if any alteration should chance; yea, in some of our extremities,
they behaved themselves so audaciously, and yet with an untoward policy, that
when they were sent for to march with the army, they made dilatory excuses, and
many times denied such attendance, as if they had business sufficient to keep
their own territories from robbery and spoils. But our worthy Deputy again,
with these new troops, he undertook the journey of the Moiry, three miles
beyond Dondalk: and attempted an impetuous assault, which continued with many
dangerous and violent skirmishes. For his horse was shot under him, his
Secretary slain by him, his friends wounded, and diverse Commanders hurt; yet
he endured all, and the God of heaven endured him, so that at the last, with a
memorable slaughter and fortunate victory, he enforced them from his fastness.

Presently finding sweet beginnings to breath life into actions, he marched to
Armagh, and tumbled those hindrances on to side, which had made that passage so
noisome, and because he would maintain an old position: Non minor est virtus,
quam quaerere, parta tueri:
He built a fort called Mount Norris, within eight miles of the Newry, and in a
manner the midway to Armagh, in honor of that worthy General, under whom he
was introducted on the martial theater. In his return (passing over many
light skirmishes) near unto Carlingford, he prevailed with a memorable
defeature of the rest, and so stored the castles with strong wards, making the
narrow water passible, and sending the pestilent Kerne lurking in every corner,
to seek for better shelter. For these new and terrible storms, had shattered
their old couerts, and almost beaten them to pieces over their heads.

Not long after, in the midst of winter, he coasted into the Glins by Dublin,
where Donnell-Spaniah-Phelin, and Raymond-Mac-Feugh, with that pestilent rabble
of O-Tooles, held such a quarter, that no man before him had either leisure to
disranke them, or sufficient forces to raise them from their firmness: these
yet he subdued, reduced, and led them by strong hand to such a way of
obedience, that Sir Henry Harrington under him went quietly to Newcastle, and
had the principal command over them; yea, I can assure you were glad to be
invited to the pleasures of his peace and entertainment, and Raymond-Mac-Feugh,
as I take it, was his tenant for Baltinglas, and gloried in nothing more, then
that he had sworn himself a true subject to the Majesty of England.

Lastly, he hasted into Feriall, where the Rebel Tirrell was pulled out of his
dark corners into the open light of discomfiture, and in the end compelled
into Vlster, to the great Co^mander of their facinorous enterprises, whither
his Lordship followed with admiration, and prevailed with all the advantages of
a fortunate Captain. For, in truth, he attempted nothing* but prevailed: and
with the Centurion in the Gospel, said to this man, go; and he went: to that,
do this; and he did it: so that if a man would then have catalogued his
particular, he might thus have set down the Items of his account, which I am
the bolder to do, because I cannot incur the imputation of flattery, not a
man remaining, that I know, to reward me, nor will not obscure the worthiness
of virtue in a General so complete and well assisted by all the properties of
honor and renown.

First then, (yet I do not presume of order, nor tie my self to the
strictness of time) he conquered the Feriall, by the death of the two sons
of Euer-Mac-Codey. He subdued the Rebels of the Fuse, and received to grace
Turlogh-Mac-Henry: he laid open the Breny, and taught us a way to march over
their boggs, yea to bring our cannons over their deepest mires, as my self was
an eyewitness in Conagh before O-Kellies own castle: he restored Tredagh,
and made those unconstant people ashamed of their willingness to become
hispaniolized: he reduced Leiale, pardoning Magennis that usurped there, and
set open their prowdest fastnes: yea, their paces and mountains were made
easy, in despite of natures difficulties and men's policies: he took to
mercy Mac-Mahond, and the O-Realies, knighting that old Sr. Patrick O-Hanland,
and corroborating all their loves as far as he went: he expelled the Rebels
from Armagh, fortifying the same with English, and came to Blackwater Sconce,
where Tirone was very cunningly encamped: but arsdeluditur art, and he
removed him in despite, casting up more sufficient trenches, and left it once
again in the fast holding arms of Captain Th: Williams: he made Lease and
Ophaly proud of their peace and prosperity: so that the Inhabitants still
gathered themselves under the covert of English protection: he set open the
Glins, and made the Brens and Tools, with other inficious Rebels ashamed to
put any confidence in devices, or reaches of men's brains. For God had ordained
the pride of life, to be subject to alteration, and the presumption of men to
be patible of counterchecking. To conclude, in a word, howeuer other men were
vertue-worthy, and valiant enough: yet this our Lord Montioy was questionless
more fortunate, as we are sensible of that term, then any man since Sr. Henry
Sidney's times, yet I may not ouerpasse that memorable Lord Gray, whose noble
spirit seemed to fly in the face of his enemies, and dimmed the sight of the
Spaniards in Smirwick and other places of Ireland, who had in those times a
determination to pry into every corner of the Country, and settle the
authority of their great Master amongst us, if it were possible. Thus Fortune
ashamed of her first churlish entertainment, welcomed him to the pleasures of
a more convenient lodging, and gave us all hope of his perpetuity in the palace
of reputation, which in that manner, as you have heard, he took possession of.

Tirone, notwithstanding, was not altogether exanimated: for what he could not
with the lions, her performed with the foxes skin, and according to an old
filthy principle: Tutum per scelera sceleribus est iter:
He cared not what course he took, or tracke he paced in, so England might be
disturbed, and his own fortunes and greatness maintained: whereupon, as in
many places you have heard, he tampered with Spain for the corroborating his
power, and employing many Agents, who brought the Popes letters to the same
purpose, effected thus much; that money was sent him, as a preparation, and
money should follow, as a full purgation of the diseases of his coffeehouse,
which made him stand the more remote from reconciliation, and vilipend my Lord
Deputy, as the Substitute of England, whom yet he honored and admired, as the
indefatigable servant of honor, which Epitheton I must needs use, because
howeuer jolly spirits, viewing only city musters, cry out, Dulce bellum
inexpertis, --
Yet in the worthiness of fearful employment, is this an occupation beyond
report, and no Labourer, Pioner, or Artificer in any mechanicke trade, did ever
take such pains, as my Lord: but I may well say with the Poet, Hectora quis
nosset? foelix si Troia fuisset?
Ardua per preceps gloria tendit iter:
For amongst other virtues in a General, patience and perseverance are the
true touch-stones of the currantnesse of the rest: now because fortune would
needs search him thoroughly, to make trial of his constancy, or to increase his
glory, the certainty of the Spaniards landing in Munster, and only life of
Tirones whole actions, taxed him with further business, and fixed all the eyes
of the Kingdom, both honest and irresolute, upon his proceedings herein, and
hopeful success to prevail unexpected.

But how in this negotiation a Spanyard designed by the Pope to be Archbishop
of Dublin, the Bishop of Clenfart, the Bishop of Killalow, and Arthur a
Jesuit, with Owen were employed: How the landing at Carlingford, or some ports
of the North only aduantagious to the project of the conquest of the whole
Kingdom, was proposed most befitting this purpose: How Don John de Aquila
Zerigo, and 6000. soldiers, attempted this invasion, the first taking Kinsale
by composition, the other fortifying Beerhauen, Castlehauen, and Baltimore: How
they sent away their own ships, either fearing our surprising, or assuring
their company, there was no means of escape, or retiring back again: How all
Ireland was amazed, and those which wished us well in their hearts, were yet
confounded with the report of Spaines ouerprized greatness: How we thickened
our selves into a clowd of opposition, by gathering all the airy vapors of our
forces, or at least so many, as might be spared to make the storm the greater:
How we encamped before Kinsale, and at one time (when Sr. George Carry Lord
Governor of Munster, was appointed to intercept, or (if you will) to ouerview
Tirones passages, coming forward with great iollity to ioyn with these
Spaniards) were not so many in our trenches without, as the enemy numbered in
Kinsale within: How at last Tirone ( Tirone I say) with 6000. foot, and 600.
horse, came forward within the view of our camp, to unite their forces
together, and exasperated our displeasure with many outcries and branado's: How
Sr. Henry Dauers General of our horse, made a gallant sally against him, till
according to their accustomed shuffling, they retired into a wood: How the
Queens ships blocked up the haven at Kinsale, and Sir Richard Luson in person
assaulted Zerigo and 2000. Spaniards, stuffed in the several castles and
harbors of Beerhauen, Castlehauen, and Baltimore, as formerly recited, and
battered the walls so forcibly from his ships (the havens lying so commodiously
for the purpose) that the enemy wondered at his worthiness, and thought that
their Lady of Heaven was willing to affect us on earth. Howeuer fourteen
several sallies and skirmishes to block up our cannons, and defeat our
approaches, impetuously drove us to encounters, on Christmas even a most
memorable victory chanced on our side: How, for many days together, it
lightened and thundered accordingly, as if the stones from heaven should fall on
Sisera's head on our behalf: How that worthy Earl of Clenricard was knighted
only of all the army before the walls of Kinsale, when the Spaniards colors
formerly surprised, were flourished as a token of thanksgiving for so
prosperous success: How my Lord of Tomond, and many worthy Gentlemen of his
Country lay close unto the town, and in our last approaches, sued for the
honour-poynt, as we term it, to assault the same after the battery: How the
Spanyard on the New-yeeres day following, sent their Drum Mayor to entreat a
parlee, and afterward grew to a composition: How at last they departed, and
were shipped by us under the ouer-looking of Captain Cotes, who set safe on
shore Don John de Aquila, and the rest at the Groine: How the Irish retired,
dispersing themselves into their several fastness and couerts: I will not
here enlarge, because you have many discourses, and a iournall written to the
same purpose.

You shall only now be certified, what this angry Jonas did, after his gourd
was withered, and how with others of that sort, he drenched himself in the
whirlepoole of confusion, when his Spanish props were shrunk, or bladders
taken away. His first retreat was into such countries, and to such persons, as
he was sure of relief, both from the nature of charity and commiseration, and
the bond of duty and former gratuity; from whence with some ado, (because his
soldiers were rather men looking after a prey, then subject to the disaster of
a defeat) he got home again with little interception of our side, the army as
yet resident at Corcke, or thereabouts, but when he came to Dungannon, the
walls seemed to weep for his disaster, that well hoped to have been new
colored with the trophies of his rebellion.

My Lord Deputy returned to Dublin. and as it was requisite and most necessary,
celebrated St. Georges Feast, and by way of thanksgiving welcomed all the
Gentlemen of the Pale, who durst not but give God the praise, and him the
renown of the victory: by which occasion Tirones proceedings had no such
couerture, but they all (as it were) in a glass, saw the change and alteration
of fortune, making this use thereof, that there is no confidence in worldly
prosperity; Nor must a man be too much elated, though terrestrial blessings
seem to make his cup to ouerflow. For the man, that of late proclaimed
himself Protector of the ancient liberty of Ireland, and Defender of the
Romish Religion, that for the same purpose led whole armies into the field, and
displayed the colors of a most dangerous innovation: that posted and reposted
through the Kingdom at his pleasure, as if Majesty meant to kiss him in the
chair of success: that was glorious in the eyes of his own people, famous to
other Nations, and a very terror to the English Inhabitants of Ireland: that
was coadiuted with the purse, navy, countenance, and an army of six thousand
well appointed soldiers from a mighty Prince: that was emboldned with the love
and admiration of his own followers: that took advantage of our first slack
proceedings to debilitate his insolence, and that promised himself the very
harbor of felicity, as being in the high way of establishment; was now subject
to distress, and bowed under the burden of mischance, and untoward alteration.

For my Lord Deputy presently followed him into his own country, and, as I
remember the bravery of Charles the fifth, upon his writing of Plus vltra, when
the West Indies were discovered, where as before the great Hercules had set up
his pillars at Gades in Spain, with this inscription: Non plus vltra: so may I
apply it unto this our General, who coming now to Blackwater Fort, cried Plus
vltra, whereas before none of our Deputies could ever step three miles beyond:
But Montioy mounted with joy even to the walls of Dung^nnon, and pitched his
tents in the fields of Tirone, expelling the great Rebel from his own house,
and taking possession of the same, and all the territories, for the use of the
Queen his Mistress: and although in a perilous encounter by the Lough,
attempting to sapp the strong castle of the same, well stored with Rebels, he
lost that valiant kinsman of his Sr. John Barkley Sergeant Mayor, of whose
worthiness one of the stars of our Country, George Earl of Cumberland, had
good experience in his voyage to St. Port Ricco: yet apprehending the chance of
war, and condition of mortality, he was no whit affrighted or troubled; but
rather exasperated to revenge: whereupon he set fire of their cabbins and
towns, entered the very castle of Dungannon, rifled the same, and although he
was wronged with a strange report of obtaining great treasure, yet I believe he
brought home one little guilt basin and eure of silver, a madder tipped with
silver and guilt, and some rotten hangings, more memorable for a trophee, then
serviceable for any glorious use. In the fulness of this prosperity, he built
the Fort of Mountioy, and fortified in many places of this dangerous country,
driving him with the rest of his followers into more remote places* and the
obscure corners of his Glan Cancones, to which when he added the cutting up of
the corn, which the cheerful soldiers performed with their swords, and
taking away their cowes, of which they had good store, it is admirable to tell
you what miseries followed, and the whole people endured. For their swordmen
perished with sickness and famine the next year following, and the poor
Calliots devoured one another for mere hunger, and showed us the lamentable
effects of a calamitous war and afflicted Country.

Thus was Tirone made the tennis-ball of fortune, and abandoned of Spaines
ouerprized greatness: thus did he see the loss of his armies, and the
miseries of his people: thus was he dejected from the pride of his possessions,
and repined to behold his adversary seated in his castles and towns: thus was
he forsaken of his friends, kindred, and accomplices, and confined into the
uncouth and remote places of his bogs and woods: thus was he afraid of
betraying, even of those which leaned on his bosom* especially when the state
bandited him, and valued his head at a thousand pound sterling, and his body
alive at two thousand pound: and thus was he made the scorn of alteration,
and spectacle of humane condition, having nothing left but a poor disconsolate
life, which it should seem the Law of nature assisted him to maintain,
otherwise a Roman spirit, in spite of mischance, had overcome distress with
a glorious death.

But time had not fully ripened as yet his fruit, nor brought forward the
harvest, that should gather in this dispersed corn: For this great tormented
Rebel, with strange demisnesse, sought his peace at the hands of his long
abused Sovereign, and with new tears begged a new life, nor was this
submission ordinary after the custom of a soldiers misfortune* but (as it
were) blotted with the spots of a guilty conscience, and interlined with a
strange manner of fearful penitency, repleat with execrations against the
cause of his misleading, and terrors of his offense, not without tears from
his eyes, drops of blood from his heart, and curses from his very soul, in
demonstration of his remorse, with protestations of better conformity, with
vows and dangerous oaths for his loyalty, with confident assurances for his
obedience, and with all the cunning that art, means, circumstances, and
insinuation accustometh in attracting pardon.

This strange news was nothing acceptable to her Majesty: For she had rather
have seen his body on the ground headless, then himself succourlesse and on
his knees begging of pardon, because my Lord of Essex had promised as much, and
out of her own greatness, she scorned to be so affronted with a subject,
and naked Rebel, as she might well term him: yea, the Council of her State
had many times urged the facility of the matter, and suggested against my Lord
of Essex, by way of exaggerating his offenses, with this one slacknesse in the
midst of his troubles: so that now to take him to mercy, after so much treasure
disbursed, so many subjects slain, so untoward disturbance renewed, so
wonderful reports dispersed, so famous an action discredited, and in a word,
the whole frame of her government abused; was an unsavory demand, and
absolutely contrary to her expectation, especially when she had been wrought
to the permission of her copper treasure in Ireland, esteemed the breake-necke
of the Rebels designs, and a mere demonstration of our wants in England.

But when the Council urged the necessity of the time, the situation of the
Country, the fearfulness of further mischief, the inconveniences of new
troubles, the threatening of the Spanyard, the new intercession of the Papists
for another invasion, the discontents of the Irish themselves, for all these
triumphs: her princely disposition was ouerwrought to a reflecting
commiseration* so that against the customs of incensed Majesty, she admitted
of his prostituted homage, and with some wonderment at the wretchedness of
Traitors, and vicissitude of all things, she gave way to his restitution, with
directions to the Deputy, to entertain him accordingly, so he made suit for
the same, and that it might appear to the world, she was an absolute Queen of
her Kingdoms, and howeuer Rebels might have ttayterous hearts supported by
foreign coadiutement, yet could no subject have powerful hands to pull the
peace of her kingdoms in pieces, or touch the skirts of her throne to disturb
her in her established mightiness.

When Tirone understood, that he must alter his compass, and turn his sails
to another coast, he then employed his brother Arthur Mac Baron, and others of
the best of his family, and nearest of his affinity, as Agents of his peace and
protection, who diverse times repulsed, when remembrance laid open his former
exorbitant actions, desisted not yet from excuses of precedent occurrences, and
forcible intimation of the necessity of his present actions, nor left they out
the true manner of his now penitency, and all their willingness to make him,
as it were, a new creature, and unite themselves in one combination for the
acknowledging the superiority of England: whereby at last that obdurate heart
of our Deputy, which at first seemed impenetrable, was deflected and cast in a
more gentle molde, so that he appointed Mellifant by Tredagh, where Sir Garret
Moore was resident, to be the school house of his conformity, and place
without other condition, then submitting to the Queens mercy, to admit of his
repentance: whither, at the time appointed, resorted our noble Lord Deputy well
attended, for the better grace of his eminent greatness, and the person he
presented: thither came also Tirone with some few Lords of the North, a
spectacle of mischance and terror to the pride of man, who supposes glory and
ostentation the felicity of this world, or presumes on wealth and authority,
the very poison of our best endeauours: Nor was it with him, as I remember the
excusing Poet in his disticke touching offenders cries out: Confugit interdum
templi violator ad aram,
Nec petere offensi niminis horret opem:
For, as the case stood, his offense and fault was the more heinous and
condemnatory, because his Prince was a woman, and one to whom he had diverse
times been beholding for his life, and in the doubtfulnesse of his first
admission to his enheritances, saw the door of her treasury and magnificent
bounty set open for him. But to the purpose.

At the first entrance into the room, even at the threshold of the door, he
prostrated himself groueling to the earth, with such a dejected countenance,
that the standers by were amazed, and my Lord Deputy himself had much a do to
remember the work in hand. For whether the sight of so many Captains and
Gentlemen, whether ashamed of himself, when he saw such a number of his own
nation spectators of his wretchedness, whether the consideration of his
fortunes, that had thus embased him contrary to expectation: whether the view
of my Lord to be his Judge, whom once he reputed to be at his mercy: whether
he repented this course of submission, and degenerating begging of life, when
a noble death had been both honorable, and the determiner of misery: or
whether man's natural imperfection, to be confounded and altered with
affliction, depressed his spirits, I know not, but it was one of the
deplorablest sights that ever I saw: and to look upon such a person, the
author of so much trouble, and so formerly glorious, so dejected, would have
wrought many changes in the stoutest heart, and did no doubt at this instant
raise a certain commiseration in his greatest adversary.

After a while the Deputy beckned him to come near: believe it, he arose: but
with such degrees of humility, as if misfortune had taught him cunning to grace
his adversity. For he passed not two steps, before he yielded to a new
prostitution, which might well be called a groueling to the ground, and so, by
divided ceremonies, fell on his knees, beginning an apology for some of his
actions, but at every word confessing, in how many treasons he had plunged
himself, offending God and her Majesty, how he had abused her favors,
disturbed her Kingdom, disobeyed her laws, wronged her subjects, abandoned
all ciuility, and wrapped himself in the very tarriers of destruction; so that
nothing remained, but to fly to the refuge of her Princely clemency, which had
so often restored both his life and honor.

Here my Lord Deputy intercepted his oratory, with disclaiming all
circumlocution, or defense of the courses he had so disorderly undertaken; nay,
he would not hear a word of justifying his dependancy on Spain, or admission
of that enmity toward England, withal applying some instructions worthy so
great a Commanders name, intermingled with reprehensions full of authority and
eloquence, he admitted him to stand nearer, and (after an hour or more) gave
him leave to be covered, using him with honorable respect, both at his board
and private conferences, and so within two days brought him as a trophe of his
victories into Dublin, with a full resolution to carry him into England, and
present him to her Majesty.

But now is the Sun of that glory ecclipsed, and the Divine providence
thought it meet to take her into his own protection. For after she had lived
and reigned, to the admiration of all nations, and filled the world with the
fame of her virtues four and forty years, and renown of life threescore and
ten, she was ordained for a better Kingdom, and the four and twenty day of
March 1602. went to take possession of it. My Lord had notice long before of
her decaying, which peradventure was an incitation the rather for the taking in
of Tirone, though he understood not so much. So this great Queen, the Wonder
of Time, the Admiration of her Sex, the Help of all Nations, the Princess of
Fame, the Mistrisse of Honor, the Terror of Antechrist, and the Commandrix of
Fortune, left her name everlasting, and dignity unmatchable. For (believe it)
what foreign Prince soever, more then to admire her, shall strive to imitate
her, will but wrong Majesty, and discover this imperfection, that emulation is
comitant to virtue, and when we cannot attain to the transcendency of
another excellency, we fall to vilipending the worth, and malicious
calumniation of the goodness: and herein let England rejoice, that the star
of dignity, and fame of those times, was set under her climate by her death,
and in her life she treasured such jewels of estimation, that the storehouses
of other palaces could not discover, or show the like.

As for Rome, and some defamatory inventions of Spain; the poison has
returned to their own prejudice, like him which spitting against the wind,
found his face besmeered with the reflection. For, the better sort both misliked
Parsons and other English Priests, in their degenerating inuectiues, and
stopped the mouths of inferiors, for once breathing amiss against her
Majesty, which makes me remember a worthy reprehension of Count Mansfield
toward Captain Rowland York, forbidding him some loosnesse of speech against
his Queen, and when he transgressed further in vndecencies of fault-finding,
both with the government and life of her Majesty: in plainer terms he assured
him, that the customs of his table would admit of no irregular behauior against
Princes: Nor can I forget Duke Byrons admiration, who at his return into
France, plainly diuulged, that the Court of England spread abroad the colors
of Majesty indeed, and all others were but a heap of confusion, and diseased
mixture of unseemly familiarity. But this is a digression: for mine own part
therefore I will only bless her inimitable renown, and end with the Poet: O
quam te memorem virgo! Namque haud tibi vultus
Mortalis! nec vox hominum sonat o Deo certe.
And so to our Irish business again.

They which write of the nature of things, say plainly (which also experience
confirms) that as there is a sympathy and sweet agreement in many creatures,
as beasts, plants, and diverse of that sort: each thriuing the better by the
others proximity and conversation: So there is a kind of antipathy and
eternal loathsomeness between creature and creature, and many times such an
abhorrency, that the very sight and intermixture of things breeds death, or
other mischief: Thus is it apparent in diverse plants growing near the Eugh
tree, which either perish immediately, or wither by degrees, without any
prosperity: they which are skillful in music say, that the strings of wolves
and sheep make a discord, and will never effect either Diapason or harmony. It
is recorded, that when Eteocles and Pollinices the sons of Oedipus were
burned, after they had slain one another, according to the solemnity of
sacrifices in those days, the very flame divided it self, showing that the
hate lasted in death, which could not be reconciled in life, and if in any
thing it ever appeared, it was and is most probable in the nature and condition
of the Irish, and our selves. For though they have been many times reduced by
conformable persuasion, and as many times corrected by powerful castigation:
yet nothing could detain them within the circle of obedience, or fasten them
to the dore-post of love and duty: nor was this the error and enmity of the
North, or (as you term it) the wild Irish only, but the inficious disposition
of the whole Nation, against whom Tirone himself, in the behalf of our
country, has gone in person, as in the excursions of Munster, Lease, Ophaly,
Meths and Conach may appear: yea, at this instant, for all the back of
rebellion seemed broken, and that this great prop of supportation, Tirone, was
taken from them, whereby they were past all hope of coadiutement, either from
him or Spain: yet did the poison of their malice and despite burst out into
boiles and botches of deformity, by rebellion against the King himself, to
welcome him the better, even the first year of his establishment in an
uncontrollable Majesty: all which did questionless arise from an inueterate
hate, and innated antipathy against us.

Again: whereas no venomous beast will live, nor is bred in Ireland, insomuch
that Beda reports, that in those days, when the I Will of Man bred a
controversy, to which Kingdom it did appertain, whether England or Ireland,
the deciding of the same consisted in this, to carry certain snakes and toades
into the Country, which if they agreed in the same, and did live, would easily
approve it English: but if they died and miscarried, then questionless, by
natural probability, Ireland had the propriety: wherein the Divine Providence
was much glorified, that would not altogether ouer-poyson a nation with noisome
creatures and beasts, considering the people were bad enough of themselves, and
had their very bloods corrupted with the venom of malice, envy, disdain,
pride and revenge, even against one another; and against us (if it were
possible) the very stones and houses seemed to swell with mislike, and grow
bigg again with the tumors of ambitious rebellion, which more apparently
appeared in the treasons of diverse towns, by name Waterford, Corcke, and
Limricke, who upon the false alarm of Sr. James Gouths warrantize from
England, for the toleration of religion, went as freshly to mass, as if the
Pope himself had established his superstitious canons in the same: Nor was
this done out of zeal or indirect devotion, according to the simplicity of
diverse, who were willing to maintain the Catholic cause; but with fury,
rage, and military directions, these strong towns entertained a presumption of
fortifying themselves against the power of England.

Whereupon my Lord Deputy was compelled to leave Tirone to himself, with a
kind of confidence of his loyalty, and politic directions for the
superuizing of his actions, and in person went forward to the suppressing these
insolences, unfolding again to his great grief and unquietness the woond up
colors of defiances which he had supposed had been laid aside for ever: so
that whole summer was spent in unheard of hurliburlies: and his return into
England procrastinated for a time: nor was the business so soon determined, or
the intricatenesse of this disturbance so easily untied, as many imagined. For
Waterford shut the gates, stood upon their guard, and denied him entrance with
his army, until exasperated with the displeasure, he read them such a lesson
of martial discipline, that they well understood a patard could blow open
their gates, a mine or battery overthrow their walls, and such a Commander
would not be dallied withal, when he determined indeed to whip their
treasons with an imperious authority, and so he proceeded accordingly, pulling
this high-looking head of innovation on her knees, depressing the glory of
their Mayor and government, forfetting their liberties to the State, and
establishing Sr. Richard Monson in the full authority of the city, who most
iudiciously for the time committed the keys of the gates to the care and
valor of Captain Meres.

At Corcke they began more roughly, demolishing the new Fort which was a
building, turning their ordnance against the castle of Shandon, which they shot
through, when my Lady Carey was in it, mustring their townsmen, to the number
of two thousand, one or other, with whom they resolved to man their walls and
defend their ports, and proceeded with a savage immanity against diverse, even
to the shedding of blood, that seemed to intercept, or be angry with their
iollity: and for all they had heard how Waterford was served, yet they durst
say, that Corcke was a stronger town, better manned, and so well fortified,
that they knew my Lord Deputies preparations were not able to surprise them,
which hastened his speediness, and increased his anger, so that they found
their abused presumption quickly ouermastred, and besides those, which were
slain in the encounters, my Lord hanged diverse, and arraigned both the Mayor
and Recorder upon high treason, setting upright again both Shandon and the new
Fort, who at either end of the town ouerlooke the same, and can by this time
batter their houses about their ears, if they do but repine, or whisper
against them.

From hence he marched to Limricke, but they growing wise by other men's
harms, according to that good council of Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula
cautum, welcomed him that would have welcomed himself, and submitted to such
directions, as he enforced against them, not without imprisoning certain
Priests and factious Citizens, whom he detained in prison, as he had done in
the other places. From hence he determined to visit Galloway, but understanding
of their conformity, he put it in the accounts of true subjects, and reputed
her as a daughter of fair conditions and good behavior: notwithstanding, he
came to Athlone, and wiping away all aspersions of rebellion, as he went, he
left them with fairer faces, then they accustomed to have: to look more
cheerfully on his Deputy Sr. George Carry the Treasurer at wars, who enjoying
both places, did proceed iudiciously in the civil administration, as little
troubled with any remarkable innovation, the rest of the time of his commorance
in the Country.

The next year our Deputy prepares for England, as made one of his Majesty's
Privy Council, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; and within a while created the
Earl of Devonshire, with some donation of land, and contribution of pensions,
to the eternal honor of such a Majesty, that would not let virtue shed a
tear for sorrow, that she was unrespected; and comfort of all the monarchy,
that were the better animated to generous performances, when they saw the
Prince would regard them. Thus is Tirone carried into England, as the trophee
of his former endeauours and victories. But what a terrible reckoning the
accounts of his treasons and undutiful proceedings summed together, every man
can tell which ouerlooked the same. For the peoples hate (as he passed through
Wales and other places) was so enflamed against him, that the women presumed to
throw dirt and stones at him, and the spredding tree which covered him, had
much ado to ouershadow and secure him from the malice and threats of such as
railed upon him: yet with some ado has he safe conduct to the Court, and our
worthy King looking on him with the eyes of a noble commiseration, quickly
welcomed him with cheerfulness, and as quickly, by the favor of Cyrus,
returned him; as the Jews to build up the walls of broken and desolate
Jerusalem: so he, to reintegrate his estate, repair his castles and towns,
and settle himself in his enheritance, as Lieutenant of the Country under the
King, and to govern the same after the manner of England.

By this time is Sr. Arthur Chichester Lord Deputy, who watched these parts of
the North more narrowly, then any other before him. First, because of his long
experience and residence amongst them, as being Governor of Knogfergus, and a
laborious searcher of Logh Con, with all the territories adjacent. Secondly, in
regard of the way open to the flourishes of peace* when the Lords of the North
saw such a unity and consent of goodness by Tirones remission. Thirdly, in
regard of his private love in these parts, to which was united a kind of fear
and observation of his virtue, he had so demeaned himself before, and
continued ever since. Last of all, by reason of straight directions from
England, to have the Shires divided with their orderly officers of Lieutenants
and Justices of peace, even amongst the mere Irish, who never heard of such
names and government before, to send out Judges of Assise, whose absolute
authority was for the time supereminent above all others, and to punish
malefactors after our Law and fashion of England, even to the terror of the
greatest, who vilipended the same, or durst oppose against the inhibition to
the contrary: which when Tirone perceived must be done indeed, he lived more
discontented then ever, and fraighted (as it were) with old stoage of malice
and envy, studied every hour how to cast off this intolerable yoke of
obedience, and not to suffer (as he termed it) another to sit Paramont in the
tribunal of his Iudicatures.

So that according to our first simile of Cyrus returning the Jews to
Jerusalem, you shall see how he kept correspondency in the same. The Jews
surfeted of ease, forgot their captivity, and returned to lick up the filth,
that their excess had vomited; yea, so exasperated the displeasure of their
great and good God, that at last he forsook them indeed, and stretched the
strong arms of Vespasian and Titus, to vnplume their iayes feathers, and throw
them forsaken over the world like dispersed vagabonds.

Tirone returns home, as you heard, lives at ease and pleasure, surfeiting
of the same, entertaineth his Priests, hearkens to his Bards and Rimers, is
seduced to mislike this new government, denies the Judges of Assise entrance
into his Country, contesteth with the Deputy about the same (although he ever
acknowledged his worth, and confessed that Sr. Arthur Chichester had united
many virtues to a Soldiers name) secondeth the Earl of Terconnel in his
repinings, and allows of Sr. Caher Odohordies contentions, maligning our
forwardness and success, when he saw him lie bleeding on the ground, and
verily supposed that the burning of the Dery, with the coming forward of
Odonnell to forage the Country, would have made another Gordion to trouble all
the Country again to untie the knot. But, as God would have it, there is
another Alexander to fulfill the prophecy, or Oedipus to dissolve the riddle,
who with a sword in his hand can cut it in pieces, so that these new Rebels
are discomfited, and such a blast of displeasure is blown against Dungannon,
as the North-east wind, that struck the four corners of Jobs eldest sons
house, and quite overthrew it, to the destruction of the people within. For
when my Lord Deputy saw no other remedy: but that Tamberlaines black flagg
must needs be set up, (the white and the red quite refused) he hasted with
fire and sword into the North, and not only tertified this rebellious Lord
with all his Accomplices, but compelled them to abandon their castles, houses,
and inheritances, taking absolute possession for his new Master the King of
Great Britain, and incorporated them to the Crown so firmly and
perpetually, that no fine and recovery of their rebellious power should or
could disanull the contract, or frustrate the deed: for England presently
seized on the same, and like a true Lord and powerful Commander, placed better
tenants, and divided the Country into several men's hands; yea, enfeoffed the
City of London with such a right, that I am persuaded all the Irish in the
world, or Irish Coadiutors will never be able to wrest it out of their hands.

Tirone being thus made the spectacle of misery, by the incitement of certain
Priests, flies into Terconnell, and contriueth with that Earl to forsake
their Country, and repair to Rome, where they might be sure to be shrouded
under the Angels wings of the Castle St. Angelo, and blessed with the holy
fathers entertainment, from the affronts of all disturbance, which accordingly
with all conueniency they could, they put in practice, gathering together what
treasure the Country affoorded, and so with his wife and children, Terconnells
wife and young son, and some fifty persons or attendants they shipped
themselves, and found sufficient friends and means to escape.

Thus like exiles forsaken, dispersed and abandoned, full of horrors of a
guilty conscience, vexed in soul by strange excruciations, tormented with
fear of being betrayed at home, abashed at the shame of being entertained
abroad, and affrighted with the disaster of their lamentable deiection: they
are at length compulsed to hide themselves amongst the rotten reeds of Egypt,
even the Pope and his Consistory of Cardinals, as in their former
determination: where, how his afflictions increased, and with what vexation of
spirit he eats the repining bran of other men's corn, that might have fed on
the fine flower of his own threshing; I believe most travelers know, but am
assured some tremble to behold the alteration: so that for my self, well
acquainted with all his entertainments abroad, and misfortunes at home, as
knowing him in Ireland, and meeting him in Italy: I may lawfully conclude: Heu
cadit in quenquam tantum scelus! tanta iniquitas!


FINIS.
