Walterus chepman


THe nobilnes and great magnificence
Off prince or lord quha list to magnify
His great ancester and linyall descente
Should first extol and his genology
So that his heart he my^ enclyne tha^e by
The more / to virtue and to worthynes
Herand rehearse his eldirs gentilnes
It is contrair the lawis of nature
A gentill man to be degenerate
Noucht following of his progenitoure
The worthy reule / and the lordly estate
A ryall renk for to be rusticate
Is bot a monster in compison^
Had in despyte and foul derision^
I say this be the great lordis of grew
Quhilk set their heart / and all than ^hale curage
Their fadirs stepp^^ justly to persewe
Eking the wor^chip of their hye lynage
The ancient and sad wise men of age
War tendour^s to the young and insolent
To make them in all virtue excellent
Like as a strand of water or a ^pring
Haldis the sapour^ of his font all weil
So did in greece ilk lord and worthy king.
Off forebea^s they tuke tarage and smell
Amang the quhilk of ane I think to tell
Bot first his gentill gene^ation^
I sall rehearse with yo^e correction^
Upon the mountane of Eli^one
The most famous of all Arabia
A godesse duelt excellent of beautee
Gentil of blude callit memoria.
Quhilk jupiter that god to wife can ta
And carnaly her knew^ quhilk estir syne
Upon a day bare him fair douch^is nine.
The first in grew was callit Eu^pe.
In our langage good delectacioun^
the secund maid namyt melpomene
As honey suete in modulacion^
Tersitor quhilk is good instruction^
Of ewiry thing the third sister I wis
Thus out of grew in latyne translate is
Caliope that maidyn m^uailus
the ferde sister of all musilk maistresse
And mother to the king sir Orpheus
Quhilk throu his wife was after king of trace
Cleo the fyft that now is a goddess
In latyne callit meditacion^
Of ewiry thing that has creacion^
The sext lady was callit herat^
Quhilk drawis like to like in ewiry thing.
The sevynt lady was fair pollymy^
Quhilk coud a thousand sangis suetly sing
thelya syne quhilk can our saulis bring
To profund wit and great agilitee.
To understand, and have capacitee
Wrany a the ix^ and last of all
In our langage quha coud it well expound
To mend my murnyng and my drery moan
Thou geve me for^e that I noucht faint nor fall
Quhill I her find for leke her such I ^all
And nouthir stynt nor stand for stok no stone
Throu thy god head gyde me quhare scho is gone
Ger her appear / and put my heart in pes
thus king orpheus with his harp allone
Sore wepi^ for his wife Erudices
Quhen endit was the sangis lamentable
He tuke his harp / and on his breast can ^yng
Syne pas^it to the hevin^ as sais the table
To seek his wife / b^^ that auaili^ no t^ing
By wa^lyng st^ete he went but ^arying
Syne com^ do^^ th^ou the spear of ^aturn ald
Quhilk fader is of all their sternis called
Quhen scho was soucht out throu that called region^
To Jupiter his grant sir can he wend.
Quhilk ^ewi^ say his lamentation^
And gert his spear he soucht fra end to end
Scho was noucht their / than doun^ he ^an des^end
To mars the god of bataill. and of stryf
And s^ucht his spear / yet gat he noucht his wife
Syne went he doun^ to his fader phoebus
God of the son with bemes bryt and clear
Bot quhen that he ^aw his sone Orpheus
In sik a plyte^ it changit all his chere
He gert anon^ go seek throu all his spear
Bot all in wayn that lady com^ nouc^t thar^
Than tuke he leve / and to venus can fare
Quhen he her saw^ he knelit and said thus
Wate ye noucht well. I am your avin true kny^
In lufe nane lelare than sir Orpheus
And ye of lufe goddess / and most of my^
Off my lady help me to get a sicht
For such quod scho. ye mon seek nethir mare
Than fra venus he tuke his leve but mare
To mercury but tarry is he gone
Quhilk callit is the god of eloquence
Bot of his wife thare^ knaulage gat he non^
With woeful heart than passit he doun^ fro thens
Wnto the moon he maid na residence
Thus fra the hevyn he went doun^ to the erde
yet by the way sum melody he lerde
In his passage amang the planetis all.
He herd a hevynly melody. and sound
Passing all instrumentis musical.
Causid be rollyng of the speris round
Quhilk armony throu all this mappamound
Qu^ill moving cesse vnyt perpetual
Quhilk of this world pluto the saul can call
Their lerit he tonys proportionate
As duplar triplar and emetricus
Enoleus and eke the quadruplate
Epodyus ry^ hard and curious
And of their sex suete and dilicius
Rygth consonant / fyve hevynly symphonyis
Compony^ a^ / as clerkis can devise
First dyatesseron full suete I wis
And dyapason simple and duply^ate
And dyapente componyt with a dys
This make.v. of three multiplicate
This merry musik and mellifluate.
Complete and full with now^^s o^ ^^vyn
Is ca^sit be the moving of the h^vyn
Off sik musik to write I do bot dote
Tha^ for at this man a stra I lay
For in my life I coud newir sing a note
Bot I will tell how orpheus tuke the way
To seek his wife atour the grains gray
Hungry and called our money will^m w^ne
With outyn gyde^ he and his ha^p alla^e
He passit forth the space of xx. dayis
Fer and full ferther than I can tell
And ay he fand stre^^s and ready way^s
Till at the last unto the yett of hell
He com^^ and their he fand a port a^ t^ll
With three hedis was callit ^erberus
A hund of hell a monster me^^a^^s
Than Orpheus began to be aghast
Quhen he beheld that ugly hellis ^und
He tuke his harp^ and on it playit fast
Till at the last throu suetenes of the ^ound
The dog slepit and fell unto the g^ound
And Orpheus a tour his wame in stall
And nethir mare he went as ye he^e ^all
Than come he till ane ryw^ wond deep
Our it a br^h / and on it siste^s three
Quhilk had the entree of the brig to keep.
Alecto / megera / and Thesiphonee
Turnand a quhele was ugly for to see
And on it spread a man hecht ixione
Rowit about ry^ wonder woe begone.
Than Orpheus ^layit a ioly spryng
The three sistirs full fast they fell on sleep
The ugly quhele sessit of her quhirlyng
Thus left was non^ the entree for to keep.
Than ixion out of the quhele can crepe
And stall away^ than Orpheus ano^e
With out stoping atour the brig is gone
Syne come he till a wond grisely flud
Droubly and deep that rathly doun^ can ^yn
Quhare Tantalus nakit full thristy stude
And yet the wa^ yede abone his chyn
Touch he gapit their wald na drop cum in
Quhen he dulkit the water wald descend
Thus gat he noucht his tri^^ to slake no mend
Before his face ane a pill hang also
Fast at his mouth upon a to^^ threde
Quhen he gapit it rokkit ^o and fro
And fled / as it refusit him to feed
Than Orpheus had reuth of his great need
Tuke out his harp / and fast on it can clink
The wa^ stude / and Tantalus gat drink
Syne our a mure with thornis thik and schary
Weping allone a wilsum way he went
And had noucht be^e throu suffrage of his harp
^yth scharp pikis he had been schorne and schent
And as he ^lent beside him on the bent
He saw spel^it a wond woeful wiche
Nailit full fast and Theseus he hi^ht
And on his breast their sat a gri^ely gripe
Quhilk with his bill his bally throu can bore
Bath maw mydred^ hertly wir and tryp^
He ruggit out his paynis war the more
Quhen Orpheus saw him this suffer sore
Has taken his harp^ and maid suete melody
The grype is filed Theseus left his ^^y
Beyond this more he fan^ a ferefull street
Myrk as the ny^ to pas ry^ dangerus
For slydnes scant my^ he hald his fete
In quhilk tha^e was a ^^ynk ry^ odiouse
That gydit him to hydouse hellis house
Quhare rodomantus and proserpina
Were king and queen / Orpheus in coud ga.
O dolly place and grondles deep dungeon^
Furnes of fire with stynk ^ntolle^able
Pit of despair with out remission^
Thy mete venym thy drink is poysonable
Thy great paynis to count vnnow^abil
Quhat creature cu^mys to duel in the

Their fand he money careful king and queen
With croun^ on head of brass full hate b^^and,
Quhilk in their life ry^ maisterfull had been
Conqueror of gold richesse and of land
Ector of Troy^ and Priam their he fand
And Alexander for his wrang conquest
Anthiotus their for his foul incest
Tha^e fand he Julius cesar^ for his crueltee
And herod with his brotheris wife he saw
And Nero for his great iniquitee
And pilot for his breking of the law
Syne vnd that he lukit and coud knawe
Cresus the king non^ ^ith^^ar on mold
For co^atise yett full of byrn and gold
Their fand he pharo^ for oppression^
Off goddis folk / on quhilk the p^agis fell
And Saul eke for the great a^usion^
Off justice / to the folk of israel
Their fand he Acab^ and queen iesabell
Quhilk sely nabot was a prophet t^ewe.

Their fand he money pape / and cardinal
In haly kirk / quhilk do^s abusion^
