NOVA BRITANNIA: OFFERING MOST Excellent fruits by Planting in VIRGINIA.
Exciting all such as be well affected to further the same.



LONDON Printed for SAMVEL MACHAM, and are to be sold at his Shop in Paul's

To the Right Worshipful, Sir THOMAS SMITH, of London Knight, one of his
Majesty's Council for VIRGINIA, and Treasurer for the Colonie, and Governor
of the Companies of the MOSCOVIA and East INDIA Merchants Peace, health and
happiness in CHRIST.
Right worshipful Sir,
FOrasmuch as I have always observed your honest zeal to God, accompanied
with so excellent carriage and resolution, in actions of best consequence, I
cannot but discover unto you for your further encouragement, the sum of a
private speech or discourse, touching our plantation in Virginia, uttered not
long since in London, where some few Adventurers (well affecting the
enterprise) being met together touching their intended project, one among the
rest stood up and began to relate (in effect) as follows.

R. I.

NOVA BRITANNIA. Offering most excellent fruits by Planting in VIRGINIA.
WHereas in our last meeting and conference the other day, observing your
sufficient reasons answering all objections, and your constant resolution to go
on in our Plantation, they gave me so good content and satisfaction, that I am
driven against my self, to confess mine own error in standing out so long,
whereby many of you (my friends) were engaged in the business before me, at
whose often instigations I was but little moved, and lightly esteemed of it
till being in place, where observing the wise and prudent speech, of a worthy
Gentleman, (well known to you all) a most painful mannager of such public
affairs within this City, which moved so effectually, touching the public
utility of this noble enterprise, that withholding no longer, I yielded my
money aad endeavors as others did to advance the same, and now upon more
advised consideration, I must needs say I never accounted my poor means
employed to better purpose, then (by Gods help) the success of this may be,
and therefore I cannot but deliver (if you please to hear) what I rudely
conceive of a sudden.

There are diverse monuments already published in Print to the world* manifesting
and showing, that the Coasts and parts of Virginia have been long since
discovered, peopled and possessed by many English, both men, women, and
children, the natural subjects of our late Queen Elizabeth, of famous
memory, conducted and left there at sundry times, And that the same footing
and possession is there kept and possessed by the same English* or by their
seed and offspring, without any interruption or invasion, either of the
Savages (the natives of the country) or of any other Prince or people (for
ought we ^eare or know) to this day, which argues sufficiently to us (and it
is true) that over those English and Indian people, no Christian King or Prince
(other then James our Sovereign Lord and King) ought to have rule or Dominion,
or can by possession, conquest, or inheritance, truly claim or make just
title to those Territories, or to any part thereof, except it be (as we hear
of late) that a challenge is laid to all, by virtue of a Donation from
Alexander the sixth, Pope of Rome, wherein (they say) is given all the West
Indies, including Florida and Virginia, with all America, and whatsoever Islands
adjacent.

But what is this to us? they are blind indeed that stumble here, it is much
like that great donation of Constantine whereby the Pope himself does hold
and claim the City of Rome, and all the Western Empire, a thing that so
crosses all Histories of truth, and sound Antiquity, that by the apt
resemblance of those two Donations, the whole West Empire, from a temporal
Prince to the Pope, and the whole West Indies, from the Pope to a temporal
Prince* I do verily guess they be near of kin, they are so like each other,
the one an old tale vain and fabulous, the other a new toy most idle and
ridiculous.

When the flatterers of Cambises King of Persia, could find no law to warrant
his immoderate lust and incestuous marriage with his own daughter, yet they
told him of another law which they had found, whereby the Kings of Persia might
do what they listed: if in these cases likewise there be a law that the Pope
may do what he list, let them that list obey him, for we believe not in him.

Letting go (therefore) these legendarie fables, which howsoever some men
hold authenticke as their Creed, yet are they in the judgment of wise men,
things of no value, nor do import to us, any cause of doubt or fear, but that
we go on in our honest enterprise, and lawful purpose now in hand, that (as
we hope) his Majesty minds not the reliquishing his estate and enterest,
derived to him by right of succession, from his immediate predecessor, but for
the further planting and succouring our old Colony, has given us leave to make
new supplies, which we lately sent thither under the conduct of Christopher
Newport Captain: And has granted many gracious privileges, under the great
Seal, to us and to our Heirs for ever, that will adventure or plant in the
said plantation: So I wish and entreat all well affected subjects, some in
their persons, others in their purses, cheerfully to adventure, and jointly
take in hand this high and acceptable work, tending to advance and spread the
Kingdom of God, and the knowledge of the truth, among so many millions of men
and women, Savage and blind, that never yet saw the true light shine before
their eyes, to enlighten their minds and comfort their souls, as also for the
honor of our King, and enlarging of his kingdom, and for preservation and
defense of that small number our friends and countrymen already planted, least
for want of more supplies we become a scorn to the world* subiecting our
former adventures to apparent spoil and hazard, and our people (as a prey) to
be sacked and pulled out of possession, as were the French out of Noua Francia,
not many yers ago* and which is the lest and last respect* (yet usually
preferred) for the singular good and benefit that will undoubtedly arise to
this whole Nation, and to every one of us in particular, that will adventure
therein, as by true relation (God willing) I shall make it manifestly appear to
all.

It is known to the world, and cannot be forgotten, that the days and reign
of Queen Elizabeth, brought forth the highest degree of wealth, happiness,
and honor, that ever England had before her time, whereof to let pass the
particular praises, as impertinent to my purpose, I do only call to mind our
Royal Fleetes and Merchants Ships, (the Jewels of our land) our excellent
Nauigators, and admirable voyages, as into all parts and round about the Globe
with good success, to the high fame and glory of our Nation, so especially
their aim and course was most directed to the new found world, to the maine
land and infinite Islands of the West Indies, intending to discover with what
conuenience to Plant and settle English Colonies, in places not already
possessed and inhabited by subjects of other Christian Princes, wherein after
many tedious and perilous adventures, howsoever strange seas and miserable
famine, had devoured and distressed ships and men of inestimable value, yet
were not the remnant escaping, swallowed up of despair, nor their heart and
spirits daunted with fear, but daily armed afresh with invincible courage, and
greater resolution (scorning to sit down by their losses) made new attempts,
not enduring to look on whilst so huge and spacious countries (the fourth part
of the world) and the greatest and wealthiest part of all the rest, should
remain a wilderness, subject (for the most part) but to wild beasts and fowls
of the air, and to savage people, which have no Christian, nor civil use of
any thing, and that the subjects only of one Prince Christian, which but
within the memory of man began first to creep upon the face of those
Territories, and now by means of their remnants settled here and there, do
therefore imagine the world to be theirs, shouldring out al other nations,
accounting themselves Kings and Commanders, not only in towns and places
where they have planted, but over all other parts of America, which contain
sundry vast and barbarous Regions, many of which (to this day) they never
knew, nor did ever setle soote therein: which notwithstanding, if it were
yielded them as due, yet their strength and means far inferior to their
aspires, will never stretch to compass or replenish the hundredth part thereof:
and this we proved true not many years ago, our Prince and theirs being then
at open hostility, their best and chiefest residences were scattered with so
poor and slender troops, that with handfuls of men (at sundry times) we ran
through all, surprising and sacking their strongest forts and towns in those
parts, and might long since with ease, following and seconding our forces, have
set them to their stint.

But seeing we so passed by their dwellings, that in seating^ our selves, we
sought not to vnsetle them, but by Gods mercy, after many storms* were brought
to the Coast of another country, far distant and remote from their
habitations: why should any frown or envy at it, or if they do, why should
we (neglecting so fair an opportunity) faint or fear to enlarge our selves,
where is our force and ancient vigor? Does our late reputation sleep in the
dust? No, no, let not the world deceive it self, we still remain the same,
and upon just occasion given, we shall quickly show it too: having now by Gods
blessing, more means then ever heretofore, being strongly senced where we
wonted to lie open: Our plant, we trust, is firmly root^d, our arms and
limbs are strong, our branches fair, and much desire to spread themselves
abroad.

But before I come to discribe this earthly Paradise, or to prove the points of
my proposition mentioned before, you shall know, that the first discovery and
actual possession taken thereof, was in the reign, and by the subjects of
Henry the seventh of England, at which time did Spain also discover, and by
that right of discovery, does retain and hold their Noua Hispania, and all
other their limmits upon that Coast: But that we now intend to ground upon is a
more late Discovery and actual possession, taken in the name and right of
Queen Elizabeth, in Anno 1584. the 13* of July, as it is truly set down in
the Book of English Uoyages, by sundry English Captains and Gentlemen in that
Uoyage, whose names are recorded in that Discourse (and many of which are yet
living) whereof when her Majesty had true information, she named the Country
Virginia, and did assign to Walter Raleigh (then a Gentleman of worth) power
and Authority to Plant forces and Colonies there, at his pleasure, who
transported thither in Anno 1587. by the conduct of John White chief Leader,
above an hundred men, Women, and Children at one time, and left them there to
Inhabit to this day: Notwithstanding, it is true indeed (as some may object.)
It is now above twenty years ago since these things were done, and yet ever
since in all this time, we never saw or heard of any good that has come from
thence, nor of any hope, that might encourage us anew to engage our selves
therein.

But let us rightly weigh the reasons of it, and then judge: Those hundred and
upwards, conducted thither by John White, and whose particular Names you may
see Recorded in the same Book of Uoyages, were left there, with intent and
promise, to be supplied from England, with more companies and all necessaries,
the next year following: in the mean time, they were to Plant and fortify
themselves in bent manner they could, and to make a Discovery of such Minerals,
and other Merchandise, as the Country should yield by nature. But as all good
Actions have their Crosses and their Bane attending on them, so had this: for
that those which had the Managing of a new Supply, being the next year
sufficiently furnished to Sea for that end, yet most unnaturally, being
Tainted with that common corruption of time, turned their head another way, and
with greedy minds, betook themselves wholly to hunt after Pillage upon the
Spanish Coast, where spending their men, their time, and provisions, they were
not able (being come and arrived at the port) to make up into the land to visit
and relieve their friends, but were forced to retire for England again,
whereby the edge of those Adventurers that set them forth was so abated, that
this most honorable enterprise so happily begun, was by this occasion most
unhappily ended, neither had our poor countri-men left there, any means from
thence to visit us, nor in all this time to give us any light of their own
estate: whereas then, if those beginnings had been followed as they ought, and
as by Gods help we now entend, that country had long since become a most
royal addition to the Crown of England, and a very nursery and fountain of
much wealth and strength to this Kingdom.

When Christopher Columbus (the first bewrayer of this new world) was to make
his proffer where he liked best, he chose Henry the seventh of England, as in
those days the most worthy, and best furnished for Nauigations, of all the
Kings in Christendom: offering to inuest his Majesty with the most precious
and richest ^aines of the whole earth, never known before, as he did also the
like to the Kings of Portugale and Spain, who (as the story says) for his
poor apparel and simple looks, and for the novelty of his proposition, was
of most men accounted a vain fool, and utterly rejected: save that the
Spanish better conceiving then some others, began to entertain and make use
of his skill, which within these hundred years, has brought forth those
apparent fruits to the world as cannot be hid. Their Territories enlarged,
their Nauigations increased, their subjects enriched, and their superfluity of
coin ouer-spreading al parts of the world, procures their Crown to flourish,
and highly commends the wisdom of Spain: whose quick apprehension and
speedy address, prevented all other Princes: albeit (as you know) their
greatness of mind arising together with their money and means, has (...) all
Christendom these forty years and more.

And this I but mention, to note the blind diffidence of our English natures,
which laugh to scorn the name of Virginia, and all other new proiects, be
they never so probable, and will not believe till we see the effects: as also
to show how capable men ought to be, in things of great importance, advisedly
to take the first occasions. We read of Haniball, when chasing home the
Romans to the gates of Rome, and neglecting then to scale the walls, could
never after with all his strength and policies come near the like advantage:
yet I must briefly tell you now, what I conceive with joy, that howsoever the
business of this plantation has been formerly miscarried, yet it is now going
on in better way, not enterprised by one or two private subjects, who in their
greatness of mind, sought to compass that, which rather beseemed a mighty
Prince, (such as ours) or the whole State to take in hand: for it is not
unknown to you all, how many Noble men of Honorable minds, how many worthy
Knights, Merchants, and others of the best disposition, are now joined together
in one Charter, to receive equal privileges, according to their several
adventures: every man engaging his purse, and some Noblemen, Knights and
Gentlemen, intending to go in their own persons, which I did hears to protest
and vow, against any people, whomsoever shall any way seek to entrappe or
impeach our proceedings, an utter revenge upon their bodies or goods, if they
be to be found upon Sea or land: whereby we have assured hope (God assisting
us) to be effectually able to make good against all, and in short time to bring
to a most happy event the thing we take in hand.

And now in discribing the natural seat and disposition of the country it
self: if I should say no more but with Caleb and Joshua, The land which we
have searched out is a very good land, if the Lord love us, he will bring our
people to it, and will give it us for a possession. This were enough to you
that are willing, but yet a little more in particular observed, by the best
Mappes and Printed discourses, and by conference of such as have been lately
there and seen it, I think good to deliver to satisfy others: First the
Uoyage is not long nor tedious, six Weeks at ease will send us thither,
whereas six Months suffice not to some other places, where we Trade: our
course and passage is through the great Ocean, where is no fear of Rocks or
Flattes, nor subject to the streighte and restraint of foreign Princes, most
Winds that blow, are apt and fit for us, and none can hinder us: when we come
to the Coast, there is continual depth enough, with good Bottom for Anchor
hold, and the Land is fair to fall with all, full of excellent good Harbors:
the world affoords no better for Ships of all burdens, many pleasant Islands
great and small affronting the Coast: Two goodly Rivers are discovered winding
far into the Maine, the one in the North part of the Land by our Western
Colonie, Knights and Gentlemen of Excester, Plymouth and others: The other in
the South part thereof by our Colonie of London: Upon which River, being both
broad, deep and pleasant, abounding with store of fish, our Colony have begun
to fortify themselves, and have built a town, and named it (in honor of our
King) James town fourscore miles within land, upon the North side of the
River (as is London upon the River of Thames) from whence we have discovered
the same River, one hundred miles further into the main Land, in the searching
whereof, they were so ravished with the admirable sweetness of the stream, and
with the pleasant land trending along on either side, that their joy exceeded
and with great admiration they praised God.

The country it self is large and great assuredly, though as yet, no exact
discovery can be made of all, It is also commendable, and hopeful every
way, the air and clymate most sweet and wholesome, much warmer then England,
and very agreeable to our Natures: It is inhabited with wild and savage people,
that live and lie up and down in troops, like herds of Dear in a Forest:
they have no law but nature, their apparel skins of beasts, but most go
naked: the better sort have houses, but poor ones, they have no Art nor
Science, yet they live under superior command, such as it is, they are
generally very loving and gentle, and do entertain and relieve our people
with great kindness: they are easy to be brought to good, and would feign
embrace a better condition: the land yields naturally for the sustentation
of man, abundance of fish, both scale and shell: of land and water fowls,
infinite store: of Dear, Rain^ and fallow, Stags, Coneys, and Hares, with many
fruits and roots good for meat.

There are valleys and plains streaming with sweets Springs, like veins in a
natural body: there are hills and mountains making a sensible proffer of
hidden treasure, never yet searched: the land is full of mineralles, plenty of
woods (the wants of England) there are growing goodly Oaks and Elmes, ^eech and
Birch, Spruce, Walnut, Cedar and Fur trees, in great abundance, the soil is
strong and lusty of it own nature, and sends out naturally fruitful Uines
running upon trees, and shrubbes: it yields also Ro^^n, Turpentine, Pitch and
Tar, Sassafras, Mulbery-trees and Silke-wormes, many Skins and rich Furs,
many sweet woods, and Dyers woods, and other costly dies: plenty of
Sturgion, Timber for Shipping* Mast, Plancke and Deal, Soap ashes, Cauiare,
and what else we know not yet, because our days are young. But of this that I
have said, if bare nature be so amiable in it naked kind, what may we hope,
when Art and Nature both shall join, and strive together, to give best
content to man and beast? as now in handling the several parts propounded, I
shall show in order as they lie.

For the first (if I forget not my self) how it may tend to advance the
Kingdom of God, by reducing savage people from their blind superstition to the
light of Religion, when some object, we seek nothing less then the cause of
God, being led on by our own private ends, and secondly how we can warrant a
supplantation of those Indians, or an invasion into their right and possessions.

To the first we say, as many actions both good in themselves, and in their
success, have been performed with badde intents: so in this case, howsoever
our naughtines of mind may sway very much, yet God may have the honor, and his
Kingdom advanced in the action done: but yet by the way, me thinks this
objection comes in due time, and does well admonish us, how to rectiffe our
hearts and ground our meditations before we begin: we do generally applaud,
and highly commend the goodness of the cause, and that it is such a profitable
plough, as every honest man ought to set his hand unto, both in respect of God
and the public good this, is our general voice, and we say truth, for so it
is.

But we must beware that under this pretense that bittet root of greedy gain
be not so settled in our hearts, that being in a golden dream, if it fall not
out presently to our expectation, we flinke away with discontent, and draw our
purses from the charge. If any show this affection, I would wish his baseness of
mind to be noted. What must be our direction then, no more but this: if thou
do once approve the work, lay thy hand to it cheerfully, and withdraw it
not till thy task be done, at all assayes and new supplies of money be not
lagge, nor like a dull horse that's always in the lash, for here lies the
po^son of all good attempts, when as men without haling and pulling, will not
be drawn to performance, for by this, others are discouraged, the action lies
undone, and the first expense is lost: But are we to look for no gain in the
lewe of all adventures? yes undoubtedly, there is assured hope of gain, as I
will show anon in due place, but look it be not chief in your thoughts, God
that has said by Solomon: Cast thy bread upon the waters, and after many days
thou shall find it: he will give the blessing: And as for supplanting the
savages, we have no such intent: Our intrusion into their possessions shall
tend to their great good, and no way to their hurt, unless as unbridled
beasts, they procure it to themselves: We purpose to proclaim and make it
known to them all, by some public interpretation that our coming thither is
to plant our selves in their country: yet not to supplant and root them out,
but to bring them from their base condition to a far better: First, in regard
of God the Creator, and of Jesus Christ their Redeemer, if they will believe in
him. And secondly, in respect of earthly blessings, whereof they have now no
comfortable use, but in beastly brutish manner, with promise to defend them
against all public and private enemies. We can remember since Don John
Daquila with his forces inuading Ireland, a noble civil kingdom, where all
(except a few runagates) were settled in the truth of Religion, and lived by
wholesome laws, under the mild government of Christian Kings and Princes, long
before his grandsiers cradle: yet he thought it no robbery to proclaim and
publish to the world, that his coming thither, was to none other end, but to
free the Nation from their bondage, and tyrannous subjection, and to bring the
blind souls to Catholic Religion: a plausible pretense, the least end of his
thought.

But if this were coined in those days by the Minters themselves, to pass for
current through the world, howsoever base it was indeed, we hope they will be
as favorable to our case, and give as free passage and allowance to our
invasion, much more current, and so far different, as not to bring a people
(according to our proverb) out of the frying pan into the fire, but to make
their condition truly more happy, by a mutual enterchange and commerce in
this sort: That as to our great expense and charge, we make adventures, to
impart our divine riches, to their inestimable gain, and to cover their naked
misery with civil use of food, and clothing, and to train them by gentle
mesnes to those manual arts and skill, which they so much affect, and do
admire to see in us: so in lewe of this, we require nothing at their hands,
but a quiet residence to us and ours, that by our own labor and toil, we may
work this good unto them and recompense our own adventures, costs and
trauells in the end: wherein, they shall be most friendly welcome to conioyne
their labors with ours, and shall enjoy equal privileges with us, in
whatsoever good success, time or means may bring to pass. To which purpose,
we may verily believe, that God has reserved in this last age of the world,
an infinite number of those lost and scattered sheep, to be won and recovered
by our means, of whom so many as obstinatly refuse to unite themselves unto us,
or shall malign or disturb our plantation, our chattel, or whatsoever
belonging to us: they shall be held and reputed recusant, withstanding their
own good: and shall be dealt with as enemies of the Commonwealth of their
country: whereby how much good we shall perform to those that be good, and how
little injury to any, will easily appear, by comparing our present happiness
with our former ancient miseries, wherein we had continued brutish, poor and
naked Britanes to this day, if Julius Caesar with his Roman Legions (or some
other) had not laid the ground to make us tame and civil.

But for my second point propounded, the honor of our King, by enlarging his
Kingdoms to prove how this may tend to that: no argument of mine can make it
so manifest, as the same is clear in it self: Divine testimonies show, that
the honor of a King consists in the multitude of subjects, and certainly
the state of the Jews was far more glorious, by the conquests of David, and
under the ample reign of Solomon, then ever before or after: The twelve Tribes
were then all subject: the bordering Nations tributarie* no doubt a happy
subjection to many of them: whereby they had the better means to believe and
know God the Creator of heaven and earth: Honorable I grant is just Conquest
by sword, and Hercules is fained to have had all his felicity, in subduing and
rooting out the Tyrants of the world, but unfeignedly it is most honorable
indeed, to subdue the tyranny of the roaring Lion, that deuoures those poor
souls in their ignorance, and leads them to hell for want of light, when our
Dominions shall be enlarged, and the subjects multiplied of a people so bought
and ransomed* not by storms of raging cruelties (as west India was converted)
with rapiers point and Musket shot, murdering so many millions of naked
Indians, as their Stories do relate, but by fair and loving means, suting to
our English natures, like that soft and gentle voice, wherein the Lord appeared
to Elias: How honorable will this be, in the sight of men and of ages to come?
but much more glorious in the sight of God, when our King shall come to make his
triumph in heaven. The prophet Daniel does assure, that for this conquest of
turning many unto righteousness, he shall shine as the stars for ever and
ever.

And yet this is not all that may be said, the ancient law, the law of Moses
settes it down, as a blessed thing, when the Prince and people of God, shall
be able to lend to all, and need to borrow of none, and it added very much to
the fame and wisdom of King Solomon, which the world came ^arre and near to
wonder at, in that his Kingdoms were replenished with gold and silver in
abundance, and with riches brought in by ships, sent yearly forth in ample
trade of Merchandise, whereof we read not the like among all the Kings of
Israel. And upon good warrant I speak it here in private, what by these new
discoueries into the Western parts, and our hopeful settling in chiefest
places of the East, with our former known trades in other parts of the world,
I do not doubt (by the help of God) but I may live to see the days (if
Merchants have their due encouragement) that the wisdom, Majesty, and Honor
of our King, shall be spread and enlarged to the ends of the world, our
Nauigations mightily increased, and his Majesty's customs more then trebled.

And as for the third part, the releeuing our men already planted, to preserve
both them and our former adventures, I shall not need to say much, the
necessity is so apparent, that I hope no Aduenturer will be wanting therein.

Our Savior Christ resembles them that give over in their best duties, to
foolish builders, that having laid the foundation, do gravel themselves in
the midde way and so become ridiculous: It had been extreme madness in the
Jews (when having sent to spy the land that flowed with milk and honey, and
ten for two returned back with tidings of impossibility to enter and
prevail,) if then they had retired and lost the land of promise: No doubt, the
Devil that envied then that enterprise of theirs* does now the like in ours,
and we must make account, and look to be encountered with many discoragements,
partly by our friends and neighbors, (such as we use to say) will neither go
to Church nor tarry at home, as also (which is no new thing) even by such as
have been sent to spy the land, one while obiecting the charge will be great,
the business long, and the gains nothing, and besides* the Anakimes that
dwell in the mountains, will come and pull us out by the ears, with such like
fooleries I know not what.

But we must be prepared with Caleb and Joshua (so highly commended) to oppose
an extraordinary zeal against the detra^^ings of such, to rescue our
enterprise from malicious ignorance, and to still their murmurings with
reproof, for though in ordinary and common occasions, it be our duty to be
carried with ordinary patience, meekenes and humility, yet to show an
excellent spirit, when the cause is worth it, and in such a case as this,
requiring passing resolution; It is but our weakness to stumble at strawes,
and a baseness to gnaw upon every bone that is cast in our way, which we may
observe by those noble dogs of Albania presented to King Alexander, whose
natures contemned to encounter or prey upon seely beasts of no valor, but with
an ouerflowing courage flying upon the Lion and the Tiger, did th^n declare
their virtue.

And now it follows, how it can be good for this Commonwealth: which is
likewise most apparent many ways. First, if we consider what strength of
shipping may be raised and maintained thence, in furnishing our own wants of
sundry kinds, and the wants of other Nations too, in such needful things
arising thence, which can hardly now be obtained from any other part of the
world, as planck and timber for shipping, with Deal and Wainscot, pipestaues
and clabbord, with store of Soap ashes, whereof there grow the best woods to
make them in great abundance, al which we may there have, the wood for the
cutting, and the Ashes for the burning, which though they be gross
commodities, yet no Merchandise is better requested, nor will sooner yield
gold or silver in any our bordering Nations. England and Holland alone, spend
in these about three hundredth thousand pounds sterling every year: we may
transport hither or unto Hamborough, Holland, or other places, fifty per
centum better cheap, then from Prusia or Polonia, from whence they are only
now to be had, where also the woods are so spent and wasted, that from the
place where the wood is cut and the ashes burnt, they are brought by land at
least two hundred miles to ship. And from thence we may have Iron and Copper
also in great quantity, about which the expense and waste of wood, as also
for building of Ships, will be no hurt, but great service to that country:
the great superfluity whereof, the continual cutting down, in many hundred
years, will not be able to overcome, whereby will likewise grow a greater
benefit to this land, in preserving our woods and timber at home, so
infinitely and without measure, upon these occasions cut down, and fallen to
such a sickness and wasting consumption, as all the physic in England cannot
cure.

We doubt not but to make there in few years store of good wines, as any from
the Canaries, by replanting and making tame the Uines that naturally grow there
in great abundance, only send men of skill to do it, and Coopers to make
caske, and hoopes for that and all other uses, for which there is wood enough
at hand.

There are Silke-wormes, and plenty of Mulberie-trees, whereby Ladies,
Gentlewomen and little children, (being set in the way to do it) may be all
employed with pleasure, in making Silk, comparable to that of Persia, Turkey,
or any other. We may bring from thence Sturgion, Cauiare, and new land-fish of
the best. There grows hemp for Cordage, an excellent commodity, and flax for
linen cloth; which being sown and well manured, in such a clymate and
fertile soil, will make great benefit, and will put down that of other
countries.

And for the making of Pitch, Tar, Turpentine, Sope-ashes, Deal, Wainscott,
and such like, we have already provided and sent thither skillfull workmen
from Foreign parts, which may teach and set ours in the way, whereby we may
set many thousands a work, in these and such like services.

For as I told you before, there must be Art and industry with other helps and
means extended, with a little patience to bring these things to pass, we
must not look to reap with joy, except we sow in tears: The abundance of
King Salomons gold and silver, did not rain from heaven upon the heads of his
subjects: but heavenly providence blessed his Nauigations and public affairs,
the chief means of their wealth.

Experience has lately taught us by some of our neighbor Provinces, how
exceedingly it mounts the State of a commonwealth, to put forth Navigations (if
it were possible) into all parts and corners of the world, to furnish our own
wants, and also to supply from one Kingdom to another, such several needful
things, as for want of shipping and other means they cannot furnish of
themselves, for this will raise experience, and men of skill, as also strength
at Sea and land, with honor, wealth, and riches, returning still to the heads
and Fountains, from whence their first occasions grew.

We may but look a little back, and we shall see what a nouice our nation
was within these sixscore years, in case of Foreign trade, not knowing whence
to fetch, nor which way to transport, but only to some mart or staple town,
within two days sailing* and that was counted so great a matter then, that
therefore they were called Merchant adventurers, and the great Hulkes of Italy,
which in those days brought spices Corants and such like, and lands at
Southampton, (the Storehouse then for Merchandise) are Chronicled for wonders
in our English Stories, for indeed we knew no better then, but were content
(as babes) with Easterlings on the one hand and Lumbards on the other, which
were continual Liegers in London, and fed us as they listed.

And take this ever as a rule, that Domesticke Marchandizing brings forth but
poor effects in a Commonwealth, whereof I needed not have showed example
further then our own doors.

What was the case of England before the golden days of Queen Elizabeth at
whose coming to the crown, the state of Merchants was so poor and mean,
that renting out her customs in wards, but at a very low rate, yet it
brought the farmer upon his knees.

A man that marks the difference, and shall compare those times and these
together, shall think it were impossible, (unless his knowledge taught him
otherwise) that the days and reign of one Elizabeth, whose hand was ever
lending, to distressed neighbor Princes, and her sword unsheathed continually,
repulsing foreign enemies, should yet relieve and raise the state of her
customs, the strength of her Navy* and the condition of her people, every way
seven fold to that they were before, only by encouraging the royal trade of
Merchandise, as we see it this day apparent: Let God have the honor, and
blessed be her memory, and the memorial of those managers of State in her
days, for their worthy counsels, many of which though they now sleep, and
rest with their Sovereign in peace, yet some do still remain, and do
succeed in place, where long may they stand and their seed after them, like
the Pillars and Worthies of King David, to shield the head and honor of our
Solomon, and still to uphold and enlarge our happiness for ever: and this I am
driven to speak and mention by the way, where I meant it not, in regard of
some which upon a disaster begin to ware weary of all, discouraging
themselves and others, from this and all other foreign adventures: to let them
know, that each thing has increase, from whence it had beginning: and to put
our selves in mind, that we fail not in furthering those causes that bring
forth such effects.

Another instance might be showed in one particular, which taxes very much our
English Nation, and all the Subjects of our sovereign King, that enjoying such
plenty of woodlands, and fruitful soiles, within England, Scotland, Ireland
and Wales: yet our want of industry to be such, that Netherlanders which have
not a stick of wood growing nor any land for sowing, should surpass and go
beyond us in continual plenty of corn and shipping, me thinks the reformation
hereof should find more favor at our hands, that in such points of civil
policy, no people of lesser means should cast us so behind, and each well
minded man should lend his help to heal and cure such stains and scarres in
the face of our state, as being viewed and wayed well, may very well make us
blush.

And now to our present business in hand, which so many stumble at, in regard
of the continual charge, I would have them know, that it cannot be great nor
long, as the business may be handled. Two things are especially required
herein, people to make the plantation, and money to furnish our present
provisions, and shippings now in hand: For the first we need not doubt, our
land abounding with swarms of idle persons, which having no means of labor
to relieve their misery, do likewise swarm in lewd and naughty practices, so
that if we seek not some ways for their foreign employment, we must provide
shortly more prisons and corrections for their bad conditions, for it fares
with populous commonweals, as with plants and trees that be too frolic,
which not able to sustain and feed their multitude of branches, do admit an
engrafting of their buds and Siences into some other soil, acounting it a
benefit for preservation of their kind, and a disburdening their stock of
those superfluous twigs that suck away their nourishment. And we shall find
that hence it was, the Goths and Uandalles with other barbarous nations,
seeing an ouerflowing of their multitudes at home, did therefore send their
Armies out as raging floods at sundry times, to cover the faces of Spain,
Italy and other Provinces, to f^ee their own from pestering: so that you see
it no new thing, but most profitable for our State, to rid our multitudes of
such as lie at home, pestering the land with pestilence and penury, and
infecting one another with vice and villainy, worse then the plague it self:
whose very miseries drives many of them, by means to be cut off, as bad and
wicked members, or else both them and theirs to be relieved, at the common
charge of others.

Yet I do not mean, that none but such unsound members, and such poor as
want their bread, are fittest for this employment: for we intend to have of
every trade and profession, both honest, wise and painful men, whereof our
land and City is able to spare, and furnish many (as we had experience in our
last sending thither) which will be glad to go, and plant themselves so
happily, and their children after them, to hold and keep conformity, with
the laws, language and religion of England for ever,

Touching which, I do earnestly admonish you to beware and shun three kinds
of people: the first, a most vile minded sort, and for the most part badde
members of this City, by some means shaken out of their honest courses, and
now shifting by their wits, will be always devising some unhappiness to
wrong the plantation: such as daily beat their brains, and seek by lying
suggestions; under color of good pretense to the Commonwealth to infringe our
ancient liberties, and would (if they were not met withal and curbed by
authority) make a monopoly to themselves, of each thing after other, belonging
to the freedom of every man's profession, the very wrack of Merchandising.

The second sort are papists, professed or Recusant of which I would not one,
seasoned with the least taint of that leaven, to be settled in our plantation,
nor in any part of that country, but if once perceived, such a one, weed him
out, and ship him home for England, for they will ever be plotting and
conspiring, to root you out if they can, howsoever they swear, flatter, and
equivocate, believe them not: keep only these two examples in mind.

Watson the Seminary priest in his printed Quodlibets: he, of all other men
protests the greatest truth and fidelity to his Prince and country;
obiecting all the bloody plottes and treasons, to have come from the
combination of Jesuits, and from Parsons that Arch-Atheist in chief, but as
for himself, he wished no longer to live and breath, then the thoughts of his
heart should be true and upright to his prince and Country: Notwithstanding,
this Watson was the very first wretch of all other, that had his hand in
treason against our King, and reapt his reward according to his wish.

The other example is a Popish Pamphlet, called the Lay Catholics Petition,
offered to his Majesty for tolleration of Popery, protesting likewise their
fidelity and unfeigned love to his Majesty, offering to be bound life for life
with good suerties for their loyal behavior: happy* men had we been to have
taken their bonds, (no doubt) for even at that instant, when this petition was
exhibiting, the chief heads of those lay Catholics, were then laboring with
all their might, to undermine the Parliament house, to shake the Pillars, and
the whole frame of the Kingdom to shiuers^

And which is more, there is newly dispersed an idle discourse against an
honorable personage of this Land, by a Papist, that terms himself a Catholic
Divine, defending Garnet the popish Priest; saying, there was nothing against
him at his arraignement, but only his acquaintance with the Powder-plotte:
which (says he) being revealed unto him in auricular confession, he might
not therefore by the law and right of Catholic religion, disclose nor make it
known.

How like you these Catholics and this divinity? if they grow so bold and
desperate in a mighty settled State, how much more dangerous in the birth and
infancy of yours? Therefore if you will live and prosper, harbor not this
viperous brood in your bosom, which will eat out and consume the womb of
their mother.

The third sort to avoid, are evil affected Magistrates, a plague that God
himself complains of by the Prophet Isaiah: O my people, they that lead
thee, cause thee to err. Touching which, I am no way able to speak enough,
for herein lies the very life of all: let no partiality prefer them, unless
they be worthy men; if they be papists or popishly minded; if profane
Atheists, contemning God and his word, turning religion to policy, unchaste,
idle, ambitious, proud and tyrannous, forgetting their allegiance to their
King, and duty to their country, neglecting their commission of employment,
advancing vil^e and vicious persons like themselves, and basely using those
that be virtuous, godly, and well affected: then look for no blessing nor
assistance of God, but misery, crosses, and confusions in all we take in hand:
but in men of knowledge, and religious education, there is ever found true
humility, temperance and justice, joined with confidence, valor and noble
courage, such as was in Moses the man of God, whose justice exceeded, and
courage was incomparable, and yet the meekest man that went upon the earth:
ten of such will chase an hundred: no adversity can make them despair,
their provident care will ever be to repulse injuries, and repress the
insolent, to encourage the paineful and best minded, to employ the idle to some
honest labors, and to relieve with mercy and commiseration, the most feeble,
weakest and meanest member.

And as for the general sort that shall go to be planters, be they never so
poor, so they be honest, and painful, the place will make them rich: all
kind of Artificers we must-first employ, are Carpenters, Ship-wrights,
Masons, Sawyers, Brickemakers, Bricklayers, Plowmen, Sowers, Planters
Fishermen, Coopers, Smiths, Mettel-men Taylers, Turners, and such like, to make
and fit all necessaries, for comfort and use of the Colony, and for such as
are of no trades (if they be industrious) they shall have there employment
enough, for there is a world of means to set many thousands a work^, partly in
such things as I mentioned before, and many other profitable works, for no man
must live idle there.

And by this imploiment, we may happily stop the course of those Irregular
youths of no religion, that daily run from us to Rome and Rhemes for
exhibition, which after a little hammering and trayning there by Parsons and
his Impes, they become pliable for the impression of any villainy whatsoever, as
appears by their positions and practices at home and abroad.

And hereby our Mariners shall not lie idle, nor our Owners sell their ships
for want of freight: you know how many good ships are daily sold, and made
away to foreign nations: how many men for want of imploiment* betake
themselves to Tunis, Spain and Florence, and to serve in courses not
warrantable, which would better beseem, our own walls and borders to be
spread with such branches, that their native country, and not foreign
Princes, might reap their fruit, as being both exquisite Nauigators, and
resolute men for service, as any the world affoords.

We intend to Plant there (God willing) great plenty of Sugar Canes, for
which the soil and clymate is very apt and fit; also Linseed, and Rapeseeds to
make Oiles, which because the soyle^s strong and cheap, may there be sowed and
the oil made to great benefit: we must plant also Orenges, Limons, Almonds,
Anniseeds, Rice, Cummin, Cotton wool, Carowey seeds, Ginger, Madder, Olives,
Oris, Sumacke and many such like, which I cannot now name, al very good
Merchandise, and will there grow and increase, as well as in Italy or any other
part of the streights, whence we fetch them now. And in searching the land,
there is undoubted hope of finding Cochinell, the plant of rich Indico,
Graineberries, Beauer Hydes, Pearls, rich Treasure, and the South sea, leading
to China, with many other benefits which our daylight will discover.

But of all other things, that God has denied that country, there is want of
Sheep to make woollen cloth, and this want of cloth, must always be supplied
from England, whereby when the Colony is thoroughly increased, and the Indians
brought to our Civility, (as they will in short time) It will cause a mighty
vent of English clothes, a great benefit to our Nation, and raising again of
that ancient trade of clothing, so much decayed in England: whose lifting up
again (me thinks I see apparently approaching, by the good dispositions of our
best sort of Citizens, who willingly engage themselves to undertake all new
discoueries, as into this of the West, and by the North West to find out
China. And unto the East beyond the Cape, into the Red Sea, the gulf of
Persia, the streights of Sunda, and among all the Kings of India, for the good
and honor of our Nation: Which calls to mind, a blind Prophecy in one of
the Sibells, that before the end of the world there shall be a discovery of
all Nations: which shall come to be known and acquainted together, as one
neighbor with another, which since the confusion of tongues have lyeu obscure
and hid.

But howeuer that be, yet these good minds and resolutions, do serve for
imitation to others, and do deserve assuredly the best encouragement, whereby
we shall not still betake our selves to small and little Shipping (as we
daily do begin) but shall rear again such Merchants Ships both tall and
stout, as no Foreign Sail that swimmes shall make them veil or stoop:
whereby to make this little Northern corner of the world, to be in short time
the richest Storehouse and Staple for Merchandise in all Europe.

The second thing to make this plantation is money, to be raised among the
adventurers* wherein the sooner and more deeply men engage themselves, their
charge will be the shorter, and their gain the greater, as in this last point
which I have to speak for the good of each particular Aduenturer, I will make
it plain.

First you shall understand, that his Majesty has granted us an enlargement
of our Charter, with many ample privileges, wherein we have Knights and
Gentlemen of good place: Named for the Kings counsel of Virginia to govern
us: As also every Planter and Aduenturer shall be inserted in the Patent by
name: This ground being laid, we purpose presently to make supply of Men
Women and children (so many as we can) to make the Plantation. We call those
Planters that go in their persons to dwell there: And those Adventurers that
adventure their money and go not in person, and both do make the members of one
Colonie. We do account twelve pound ten shillings to be a single share
adventured. Every ordinary man or woman, if they will go and dwell there, and
every Child above ten years, that shall be carried thither to remain,
shall be allowed for each of their persons a single share, as if they had
adventured twelve pound ten shillings in money. Every extraordinary man, as
Divines, Governors, Ministers of state and Justice, Knights, Gentlemen,
Physicians, and such as be men of worth for special services, are all to go
as planters, and to execute their several functions in the Colonie, and are to
be maintained at the common charge, and are to receive their Diuident (as
others do) at seven years end, and they are to be agreed with all before they
go, and to be rated by the Council, according to the value of their persons:
which shall be set down and Registered in a book, that it may always appear
what people have gone to the Plantation, at what time they went, and how their
persons were valued: And likewise, if any that go to be planters will lay
down money to the Treasurer, it shall be also registered and their shares
enlarged accordingly* be it for more or less. Al charges of settling and
maintaining the plantation, and of making supplies* shall be borne in a joint
stock of the adventurers for seven years after the date of our new
enlargement: during which time there shall be no adventure, nor goods returned
in private from thence, neytheir by Master, Mariner, Planter nor passenger,
they shall be restrained by bond and search, that as we supply from hence to
the Planters at our own charge all necessaries for food and apparel, for
fortifying and building of houses in a joint stock, so they are also to return
from thence the increase and fruits of their labors, for the use and
advancement of the same joint stock, till the end of seven years: at which
time we purpose (God willing) to make a division by Commissioners appointed,
of all the lands granted unto us by his Majesty, to every of the Colonie,
according to each man's several adventure, agreeing with our Register book,
which we doubt not will be for every share of twelve pound ten shillings,
five hundred acres at least. Now if any think that we shall be tied to a
continual charge, of making new supplies for seven years, let them conceive
thus much, that if we do it thoroughly at the first, by engaging our selves at
once, in furnishing many men and other means: assuredly after the second
year, the returns from thence will be able with an ouer-plus, to make supplies
at large, so that our purses shall be freed, and the ouer-plus of stock will also
grow to greatness, which stock is also (as the land) to be divided equally at
seven years end or sooner, or so often as the company shall think fit for the
greatness of it, to make a Diuident.

And as by this we shall be soon freed from charge and expense, so there
grows a greater benefit to the planters (by bestowing their labors
cheerfully) to make return of Stock, for hereby the sooner they f^eeing us
from disbursments, the more our shares and portions will be lessened in the
Diuident of Stock and land at seven years end* whereby the less coming to
us, the more will be to them, so that here is no discouragement any way, if
men will be capable to do themselves good. But if we will be so wise to
linger, and lie in the wind, to hear what news, to bring in our Stock next
year, and when we are behind for four or five Adventures, we come dropping
in with one or two and still run in arrerages for twice so much: (For I know
many that would bring in stock amongst us, but they lie out to see what
success first: and upon such like terms.) Is this Gentleman-like or
Marchant-like, in truth it is paultry, and such as would bring all to naught,
if we should be so minded too, and I tell you true, our single shares will make
but a hungry Plantation, if we do not at the least double them now: and
therefore I urge it the more, for that the very life of all is now in the
beginning by making our supplies thoroughly, and thence will our gains arise
both sooner and certain. yet I grant that others may come in hereafter at any
time, either to adventure h^s person or money, or both, but if there be spent
one year of the seven before he comes in, or he that comes in with the first
shall notwithstanding be a year behind in supplies, they shall be both alike
shortened in a seventh part of the Diuident both of stock and lands, and if
two years behind, then shortened two seuenths, and if but six months, yet a
fourteenth part, for every man is Registered according to the time, his money
or person began to adventure, or made supply, so that they which come late*
get not the (...) of those that bore the first brunt of the business, and this
will neither advantage him that withholds nor hinder ^im that is forward* for
whatsoever falls from him that is slack, will be found of him that supplies in
due time. But every man that comes in now in the first of these seven years and
shall afterward upon al occasions perform i^ due time, every twelve pound ten
shillings so brought in shall be accounted an entice single share, and shall
receive accordingly without abridgement, as it had been brought in, when the
enterprise first began, and not otherwise.

And as for the divisions of lands at seven years end which (some may
object) will be little worth* and unequally d^uided: let them understand, that
no man shall have his lot entirely in one place, to be al of the best, or al of
the worst, but each man shall have proportionably to his adventures, in three
or four distinct differences, that may be made in the goodness or badnes of
the grounds by Commissioners equally chosen by the Adventurers here, and the
Planters there; and as for the value and little worth now, of those grounds in
Virginia, we know that in England within these thirty or forty years, the
yearly rent of those grounds (in many places) were not worth five shillings,
that now do go for forty and more.

And howsoever those grounds in Virginia are now but little worth indeed, yet
time and means will make them better, considering how they pass our grounds
in England, both in regard of the soil and clymate, fit for many precious
uses: And also in how many several places we purpose to plant our Colony, and
not to bestow our costs upon Iames-towne only, and upon the grounds lying
thereabout, and to let al* the rest lie barren: for seeing his Majesty has
granted to our Colony as much circuit of ground as all England almost we
purpose (God willing) if we may be supplied with sufficient means) to settle
out of hand, six or seven plantations more, al upon, or near our main-riuer,
as capital towns, twenty miles each from other, and every plantation shall
manure and husband the lands and grounds lying near unto it, and allotted for
the circuit thereof, and shall all endeavor for a joint stock, and shall be
still supplied from hence with more money and provisions, and against any
public injury shall be ready to unite, and join themselves together. and by
this mea^es we shall come to have our Diuident in lands of worth and well
manured, which will be either bought or rented of us at a good value by the
planters, or by such as intend hereafter to inhabit there, as also by these
several plantations (which happly one place better fitting then another) we
shall bring forth more several sorts of Merchandise, and be also better
fortified: and besides the Planters will be in such hope to have their own
shares and habitations in those lands, which they have so husbanded, that it
will cause contending and emulation among them, which shall bring forth the
most profitable and beneficial fruits for the joint stock.

Whereby undoubtedly, we shall be soon freed from further expense, our gains
will grow* and our stock increase, we shall fell our timber, saw our planck,
and quickly make good shipping there, and shall return from thence with good
employment, an hundred sail of good Ships yearly, all which good and much
more, we shall withstand and bring our selves into a laborinth, if we pinch
and spare our purses now: therefore not to hold you longer with many words,
(being near Exchange time as I take it) remember what I have said in proving
my proposition, and take my conclusion in a word or two.

Seeing our prouocations are so many, our cause and title good, auaunt all idle
oracles that seek to bar us: The wisdom of the wisest says in these cases,
Whatsoever thy hand shall find to do, do it with all thy might.

Our forefathers not looking out in time, lost the prime and fairest proffer of
the greatest wealth in the world, and we tax their omission for it, yet now it
falls out, that we their children are tried in the like, there being yet an
excellent portion left, and by Divine providence offered to our choice, which
(seeing we have arms to embrace,) let it not be accounted hereafter, As a
prize in the hands of fools, that had no hearts to use it.

The honor of our nation is now very great by his Majesty's means and we his
subjects cannot enlarge and uphold it by gazing o^, and talking what has been
done, but by doing that good, which may be commended hereafter, if we sit
still and let slip occasions, we shall gather rust, and do vnfeather our own
wings, committing the folly of the wise Romans herein, that in time of their
glory, flowing with the Conquestes and spoils of the world, and having gotten
the Goddess Victoria to Rome, they clipped her wings* and set her up among their
Gods, that she might take her flight no more, as she had formerly done from
the Gretians and others, and so effeminating their valor with idleness and
security, it brought confusion and ruin to their state.

Let not such a prize of hopeful events, so lately purchased by the hazard of
our valiant men* in the deep Seas of foreign dangers, now perish in the Haven
by our neglect, the lives of our friends already planted, and of those noble
Knights and Gentlemen that entend to go shortly, must lie at our mercy to be
relieved and supplied by us, or to be made a prey unto others (though we fear
not the subjects of any Prince in amity, that they will offer wrong unto us:)
And howsoever we hear tales and rumors of this and that, yet be not dismayed,
for I tell you, if we find that any miscreants have wronged, or go about to
hurt our few hundreds there, we shall be ready to right it again with many
thousands, like the giant Anteus, whose often foiles renewed his strength the
more.

And consider well that great work of freeing the poor Indians from the
deuourer, a compassion that every good man (but passing by) would show unto a
beast: their children when they come to be saved, will bless the day when
first their fathers saw your faces.

If those undaunted English and Scottish Captains* that so often ventured
their lives, and spilt their blood, to reconquer Palestina from the Turks and
Sarazens, had seen the gappe so open in their days, and the way leading to so
many goodly purchases, certainly it had not now been left for us to do. How
strange a thing is this that all the States of Europe have been a sleep so
long? that for an hundred years and more, the wealth and riches of the East and
West should run no other current but into one coffer, so long til the running
over, spread it self abundantly among a factious crew of new created Friars,
and that to no more special end, then with instigating bloody plots to pierce
the heart of a Christian State and true Religion.

It is long since I read in a little treatise, made by Frith an English
Martyr, an excellent foretelling touching the happiness of these Northern
Islands, and of great wonders that should be wrought by Scots and English,
before the coming of Christ, but I have almost forgotten, and cannot readily
call it to mind as I would, and therefore I omit it now, Protesting unto you,
it would be my grief and sorrow, to be exempted from the company of so many
honorable minded men, and from this enterprise, tending to so many good ends,
and then which, I truly think this day, there is not a work of more
excellent hope under the Sun, and far excelling (all circumstances wayed)
those Noble deeds of Alexander, Hercules and those heathen Monarks, for which
they were deemed Gods among their posterity.

And so I leave it to your consideration, with a memorable note of Thomas Lord
Howard Earl of Surry, when K. Henry the eight, with his Nobles at Dover took
shipping for Turwin and Turney, and bidding the said Earl farewell, whom he
made Governor in his absence, the Story says the Nobleman wept, and took his
leave with tears, an admirable good nature in a valiant mind, greeuing to be
left behind his Prince and Peers in such an honorable service.

FINIS.
