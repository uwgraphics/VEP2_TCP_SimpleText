THocht feneit Fabillis of auld Poetry,
Be nocht all groundit upon treuth: it than,
Their polite termis of sweit Rhetorie,
Richt plesand ar unto the eir of man.
And als the cause, that they first began,
Was to repreif the haill misleuing
Of man, be figure of ane other thing.
In like manner, as throw the busteous eird,
(Swa it be laubourit with greit diligence)
Springis the flouris, and the corn abreird,
Hailsum and good to mannis sustenance.
Sa dois spring ane Moral sweit sentence
Out of the subtell dyte of Poetry:
To good purpois quha culd it weill apply.
The Nuttis schell thocht it be hard, and teuch,
Haldis the Kirnell, and is delectabill.
Sa lyis their ane doctrine wise aneuch,
And full of fruit, under ane feneit Fabill.
And Clerkis sayis, it is richt profitabill,
Amangis ernist to ming ane merry sport,
To licht the spreit, and gar the time be schort.
Forther mair, ane Bow that is ay bent,
Worthis vnsmart, and dullis on the string.
Sa gais the man, that is ay diligent
In ernistfull thochtis, and in studying,
With sad materis sum merines to ming.
Accordis weill thus Esope said I wis,
Dulcius arrident seria picta Iocis.
Of this Author my Maisteris with our leif,
Submitting me in our correctioun:
In Mother tongue of Latyne I wald preif,
To make ane matter of Translatioun.
Nocht of my self, for vane presumptioun,
Bot be requeist, and Precept of ane Lord,
Of quhome the Name it neidis not record.
In hamelie language and in termis rude,
Me neidis write: for quhy of Eloquence.
Nor Rethorike, I never understood.
Thairfoir meiklie I pray our reverence,
Gif that e find it throw my negligence,
Be deminute, or it superfluous,
Correct it at our willis gracious.
My Author in his Fabillis tellis ow,
That brutall beistis spak, and vnd^rstude.
In to good purpois dispute, and maid argow.
In Philosophy propone, and ei^ conclude.
Put in exempill, and in similitude,
How money men in operatioun,
Ar like to beistis in conditioun.
Na meruell is, ane man be like ane Beist,
Quhilk lufis ay carnal and foull delight:
That schame can not him rene, nor arreist,
Bot takis all the lust and appetyte,
And that throw custum, and daily ryte.
Syne in their myndis sa fast is Radicate,
That they in brutall beistis ar transformate.
This Nobill Clerk, Esope, as I haif tauld,
In gray vestiment, and in facound purpurate,
Be figure wrait his buke: for he nocht wald
Lak the wisdom of hie, nor law estait.
And to begin, first of ane Cok he wrait,
Seikand his meit, quhilk fand ane Iolie stone,
Of quhome the Fabill e sall heir anon.
Ane Cok sumtyme with feddrame fresche and gay
Richt cant, and Crous, albeit he was bot pure:
Flew forth upon ane dounghill sone be day,
To get his dennar set was all his cure.
Scraipand amang the as, be adventure,
He fand ane Iolie Iasp, richt precious,
Was cast in forth in sweping of the house.
As Damysellis wantoun, and Insolent,
That fane wald play, and on the streit be seen.
To swoping of the house they tak na tent.
They cair na thing, swa that the flure be clean.
Iowellis ar tint, as oftymis hes been seen,
Upon the flure, and swopit forth anon.
Peradventure, sa was the samin stone.
Sa meruelland upon the stane (quod he)
O gentill Iasp: O rich and Nobill thing:
Thocht I the find, thou ganis not for me.
Thou art ane Iowell for ane Lord, or King.
Piety it were, thou should ly in this midding,
And buryit be thus on this muke on mold,
And thou so fair, and worth is mekill gold.
It is piety I should the find, for quhy,
Thy greit vertew, nor it thy color cleir,
It may me nouther extol, nor magnify:
And thou to me may make bot lytill cheir.
To greit Lordis thocht thou be leif, and deir,
I lufe fer better thing of les auaill,
As draf, or corn, to fill my tin Intraill.
I had lever haif scraipit heir with my naillis,
Amangis this mow, and luke my lyfis fude,
As draf, or corn, small wormis, or snaillis,
Or any meit wald do my stomok good:
Than of Iaspis ane mekill multitude.
And thou agane, upon the samin wyis,
For thine auaill may me as now despyis.
Thou is na corn: and thairof haif I neid.
Thy color dois bot confort to the sicht.
And that is not aneuch my wame to feid.
For wyfis sayis, luk and werkis ar licht.
I wald haif sum meit, get it gif I micht.
For houngrie men may not leif on lukis:
Had I dry breid, I count not for na cukis.
Quhar should thou make thy habitatioun?
Quhar should thou dwell, bot in ane Royal Tour?
Quhar should thou sit, bot on ane Kingis Croun,
Exaltit in worschip and in greit honor?
Rise gentill Iasp, of all stanis the flour,
Out of this midding, and pas quhar thou should be,
Thou ganis not for me, nor I for the.
Leuand this Iowell law upon the ground,
To seik his meit this Cok his wayis went.
Bot quhen, or how, or quhome be it was found,
As now I set to hald na Argument.
Bot of the Inward sentence, and Intent
Of this (as mine Author dois write)
I sall reheirs in rude and hamelie dite.
This Iolie Iasp had properteis seuin:
The first, of color it was marvelous:
Part like the fire, and part like to the heuin.
It makis ane man stark and victorious.
Preseruis als fra cacis perrillous.
Quha hes this stane, sall haif good hoip to speid,
Or fire, nor watter him neidis not to dreid.
MORALITAS.
THis gentill Iasp, richt different of hew,
Betakinnis perfect prudence and cunning.
Ornate with money deidis of vertew,
Mair excellent, than any tirthlie thing.
Quhilk makis men in honor for to Ring.
Happy, and stark to win the victory
Of all vycis, and Spiritual enemy.
Quha may be hardy, rich, and gracious?
Quha can eschew perrell and adventure?
Quha can Govern in ane Realm or house
Without science, over all thing I ow assure?
It is riches that ever sall Endure,
Quhilk Maith, nor moist, nor vthes rust can froit,
To mannis Saull it is Eternal m^^t.
This Cok desyrand mair the sempill co^^^,
Than any Iasp, may till ane fule be peir.
Quhilk at science makis bot ane mock and scorn,
And na good ca^ als lytill will ^e leir.
His heart wammillis wise argument to beir,
As dois ane Sow to ^uhome men for the nanis
In her draf tro^ch wald saw precious stanis.
Quha is enemy to science and cunning,
Bot Ignorance, that vnderstandis nocht?
Quhil^ is s^ Nob^^^ s^ pre^ious, and sa ding,
That it may not with eirdlie thing be ^ocht.
Weill war that man over all other that moch^
All his life dayis in perfect study wair,
To get s^ien^^: for him neidis na mair.
Bot now (allace) science is tint and hid:
We se^k it nocht, nor preis it for to find.
Ha^f we riches, na better life we bid,
Of science thocht the Saull be bair and blind.
Of this matter to ^peik, it were bot wind.
Thairfoir I ceis, and will na forther say.
Ga seik the Iasp, qu^a will, for their it lay.
FINIS.
The Taill of the Uponlandis Mous, and the Burges Mous.
ESope mine Author makis mentioun,
Of two Myis, and they were Sisteris deir.
Of (...) ye eldest dwelt in ane Borrous to^^:
The other w^^nit Uponland we^ll ^ei^:
Soliter, quhyle under busk, quhyle under breir:
Quh^^^^ in the corn, and other mennis skaith,
Is o^^l^wi^ dois and l^^is on their waith.
This rural Mous in to the winter tide,
Had hunger, cauld, and tholit greit distres,
The other Mous that in the Burgh can bide,
Was Gild brother and maid ane fre Burges.
Toll fre als but custum mair or les,
And fredome had to ga quhair ever scho list,
Amang the cheis in Ark, and meill in kissed.
Ane time quhen sho was full and vnfute sair,
Scho tuke in mind her sister vponland,
And langit for to heir of her we^lfair,
To se quhat life scho had under the wand.
Bairfute allone with pykestaf in her hand
As pure Pilgryme scho passit out of town
To seik her sister both over daill and down.
Forth money wilsum wayis can scho walk,
Throw moss and muir throw ba^kis blak and breir,
Scho ran with money ane hiddeous quaik,
Cum forth to me my awin Sister deir,
Cry peip anis, with that the Mous cryit heir,
And knew her voce as Kinnisman will do
Be verray kind, and forth scho come her to.
The hartlie joy God gif e had seen,
Beis kith quhen that their Sisteris met,
And greit kyndenes was schawinthame betuene,
For quhylis they leuch, and quhylis for joy they great
Quhyle kissit sweit, quhylis in armis plet,
And thus they fure quhill soberit was their mind,
Syne fute for fute unto the chalmer wend.
As I hard say it was ane sober wane
Of fog and fai^n full f^billie was maid,
Ane s^^lie scheill under ane steidfast stane,
Of quhilk the entres was not hie nor braid.
And in the samin they went but mair abaid,
Without fire or candill birnand bricht,
For commounlie sie pykeris lufis not licht.
Quhen they were lugit thus their selie Myse,
The oungest sister into her butterie eid,
And brocht forth nuttis, and candil in steid of spyce.
Gif this was good ^air I do it on them beside.
The Burges Mous prompit f^rth in pride.
And said sister is this our daily fude?
Qyhy not (quod scho) is not this meit rycht good?
Na be my faull I think it bot ane scorn.
Madame (q^od scho) e be the mair to blame,
My mother said sister quhen we were borne,
That I and e lay both within ane wame.
I keip the rate and custume of my dame,
And of my leuing into poverty,
For landis haif we nane in property.
My ^air sister (quod scho) haif me excusi^
This rude diet and I can not accord.
To tender meit my stomok is ay vsit,
For quhylis I fair alsweill as any Lord.
Their widderit peis, and nuttis or they be board
Will back my teith, and make my wame full sklender,
Quhilk was befoir vsit to meittis tender.
Weill, weill, sister (quod the rural M^us),
Gif it pleis ow sie thingis as e se heir,
Bai^h meit and drink, ha^berie and house,
S^lbe our a win will e remane all e^r.
e sall it haif with blyith and merry cheir,
And that should make the maissis that are rude,
Amang freindis richt tender and wonder good.
Quhat pleasure is in the Feistis delicate
The quhilkis ar geuin with ane glowma^d brow?
Ane gentillhart is better recreat
With blyith curage than seik to him ane Kow.
Ane Modicum is mair for till allow,
Swa that good will be keruer at the dais
Than thrawin will and money spycit mais.
For all her merry exhortatioun,
This Burges Mous had lytill will to sing.
Bot heuilie scho kest her browis down
For all the daynteis that scho culd her bring.
it at the last scho said half in hething,
Sister, this victual and our royal feist
May weill su^fice unto ane rural beist.
Lat be this hole and cum into my place
I sall to ow schaw be experience,
My good friday is better nor our Pace,
My dische weschingis is worth our hai^ expe^ce,
I haif housis anew of greit defense,
Of Cat, nor fall trap, I haif na dreid.
I grant (quod scho, and on togidder they eid.
In st^bbill array throw gers and corn,
And under buskis pre^elie couth they creip,
The eldest was the gyde and vent beforne,
The ounger to her wayis tuke good keip.
On nicht they ran, and on the day can sleip,
Quhill in the morning or the Lauerok sang,
They ^and the town, and in blythlie couth gang.
Not fer fra thine unto ane worthy vane,
This burges brocht them sone quhar thai should be.
Without God speid their herberie was taken
In to ane spence with vittell greit plenty,
Both Cheis and Butter vpone their skelfis hie,
And ^^eshe and fish aneuch of fresh and salt,
And sekkis full of meill and eik of malt.
After quhen they disposit were to dyne,
Withouttin grace they weshe and went to meit.
With all coursis that Cukis culd deuyne,
Muttoun and beif strikin in taileis greit.
Ane Lordis fair thus couth they counterfeit,
Except ane thing they drank the watter cleir,
In steid of wine bot it they maid good cheir.
With blyith vpcast and merry countenance,
The eldest Sister sperit at her gaist.
Gif that scho be ressone fand difference,
Betuix that chalmer and her sarie nest.
e dame (quod scho) how lang will this lest?
For euermair I wait and langer to.
Gif it be swa e ar at eis (quod scho).
Til eik their cheir ane subcharge forth scho brocht,
Ane plait of grotis, and ane dische full of meill
Thraf caikkis als I trow scho spairit nocht,
Aboundautlie about her for to to deill.
And mane full ^yne scho brocht in steid of geill,
And ane quhyte candill out of ane coffer stall,
In steid of spyce to gust their mouth withal.
This maid they merry quhil they micht na mair,
And haill ule haill cryit upon hie
it after joy oftymes cummis cair,
And troubill after greit prosperity,
Thus as they sat in all their iolitie,
The spenser come with keyis in his hand,
Oppinnit the dure and them at denner fand.
They taryit not to wesche as I suppose,
Bot on to ga quha that micht formest win.
The Burges had ane hole, and in scho gois,
Her sister had na hole to hyde her in,
To se that selie Mous it was greit sin
So desolate and will of ane good reid,
For verray dreid scho fell in swoun neir deid.
Bot as God wald it fell ane happy case,
The Spenser had na laser for to bide.
Nouther to seik nor search, to sker nor chase,
Bot in he went, and left the dure up wide.
The bald Burges his passing weill hes spyde,
Out of her hole scho come, and cryit on hie.
How fair e sister cry peip quhair ever e be.
This rural Mous lay flatling on the ground
And for the deith scho was full sair dredand.
For till her heart straik money wofuls stound,
As in ane fever scho trimbillit fute and hand.
And quhan her sister in sic ply her fand,
For verray piety scho began to greit,
Syne confort her with wordis hnmbill and sweit.
Quhy ly e thus rise up my sister deir?
Cum to our meit, this perrell is ouerpast.
The other answerit her with heuie cheir,
I may not eit sa sair I am aghast.
I had ^euer ^hi^ forty day is fast,
With watter caill^ and to gnaw benis or peis,
Than all our feist in this dreid and diseis.
With fair tretie it scho gart her vpryse,
And ^o the burde they went and togidder sat,
And scantly had they drunkin anis or twy^e,
Quhen in come G^^ hunter our Iolie Cat,
And bad God speid, the Burges up with that,
And till the hole scho went as fire on flint,
Bawdronis the other be the bak hes hint.
Fra fute to fute he kest her to and fra,
Quhylis up, quhylis down, als cant as any Kid.
Quhylis wald ^e lat her ^in under the stra,
Quhylis wald he wink, and play with her buk heid.
Thus to the selie Mous greit pane he did.
Q^hill at the last throw fortune and good hap,
Betuix ane burde and the wall scho crap.
And up in haist behind ane partalling,
Scho clam so hie that Gilbert micht not get her.
Syne be the cluke their craftelie can hing,
Till he was gane her cheir was all the better.
Syne down scho lap quhen their was nane to let her.
And to the Burges Mous loud can scho cry,
Fairweill sister thy Feist heir I de^y.
Thy mangerie is mingit all with cair,
Thy guse is good thy gansell four as gall.
The subcharge of thy service is bot sa^t,
Sa sall thou find heir e^terwart na faill.
I thank one courtyne and one perpall wall
Of my defense now fra ane crewell beist.
Almychtie God keip me fra sic ane Feist.
Were I into the kith that I come fra,
For weill nor woe, should never cum agane.
With that scho tuke her leif and forth can ga,
Quhylis throw the corn, and quhylis throw the plant
Quhen scho was forth and fre scho was full fane.
And merili^ markit unto the mure.
I can not tell how weill thairefter scho fure.
Bot I hard say scho passit to her den,
Als warm als weill suppose it was not greit,
Full beinly stuffit, both but and ben
Of Beinis, and Nuttis, Peis, Ry, and Quheit.
Quhen ever scho list scho had aneuch to eit,
In quiet and eis withoutin any dreid,
Bot to her sisteris feist na mair scho eid.
MORALITAS.
FReindis e may find and e will tak heid,
Into this fabill ane good morality.
As fitchis myngit at with nobill seid,
Swa intermynglit is adversity,
And als troubill, and sum vexatioun,
With eirthlie joy, swa that na estait is fre,
That are not content of small possessioun,
And namely they quhilk climinis up may hie^.
Blissit be ^empill life withoutin dreid.
Blissit be sober feist in quietie.
Quha hes aneuch of na mair hes he neid,
Thocht it be lytill into quantity.
Greit abundance and blind prosperity,
O^^ymes ma^is ane evil conclusioun.
The sweitest life thairfoir in this cuntrie,
Is sickernes with small possessioun.
Thy awin fire my friend, sa it be bot ane gleid,
It warmis weill, and is worth Gold to the.
And Solomon sayis gif that thou will reid,
Under the henin it can not better be,
Than ay be blyith and leif in honesty.
Quhairfoir I may conclude be this ressoun,
Of eirthly joy it beiris may degree.
Blyithnes in heart with small possessi^^^

The Taill of Schir Chantecleir and the Fox.
THocht brutall beistis be Irrationabill,
That is to say want and ^iscretioun.

The Bair busteous, the Uolf: the ^ylde Lyoun:
The Fox sem is crafty and cautelous:
The Dog to bark on nicht and keip the house.
Sa different they ar in properteis,
Unknawin to man, and sa infinite,
In kind h^uand sa fell diuersiteis.
My cunning is excludit for to dyte.
For thy as now I purpose for to write.
Ane cais I fand quhilk fell this ather eir,
Betuix ane ^oxe, and ane gentill Chantecleir.
(...) Wedow dwelt, in till ane drop they dayis,
^^^ilk wan her fude of spinning on hi^ (...).

Except of hennis scho had ane lytill flok,
And them to keip scho had ane iolie Cok:
Richt curageous, that to this wedow ay
Deuydit nicht, and crew befoir the day.
Ane lytill fra this foirsaid Wedowis house,
Ane thornie schaw their was of greit defense.
Quhairin ane Fox crafty, and cautelous,
Maid his repair, and daily residence.
Quhilk to this Wedow did greit violence,
In pyking of pultrie both day and nicht,
And na way be reuengit on him scho micht.
This wily Tod quhen that the Lark cou^h sing,
Full sair hungry unto the Town him dressed,
Quhair Chantecleir in to the gray dawing,
Werie for nicht was flowin fra his nest.
Lowrence this saw, and in his mind he kest,
The Ieperdie, the wayis, and the wyle,
Be quhat menis he micht this Cok begyle.
Dis^imuland in to countenance and cheir,
On kneis fell, and simuland this he said.
Good morn my master gentill Chantecleir.
With that the Cok start bakwart in ane braid.
Schir be my Saull, e neid not be effrayit,
Nor it for me to start nor fle abak,
I come bot heir service to ow to make.
Wald I not serve to ow it were bot blame,
As I ha^f done to our progenito^ris.
our Father full often fillit hes my wame,
And send me meit fra midding to the muris.
And at his end I did my besie curis,
To hald his heid, and (...)kis warm.
Syne at the last the Sweit swell in my arm.
Knew e my Father ^^^od the Cok) and leuch.

Quhen that he d^it under ane birkin beuch.
Syne said the Dirige quhen that he was deid,
Betuix us two how should their be ane feid?
Quhame should e traist bot me our Seruitour,
That to our Father did sa greit honor.
Quhen I behald our fedderis fair and gent,
our beik, our breist, our hekill, and our came.
Schir be my Saull, and the blissit Sacrament,
My heart is warm me think I am at hame,
To make ow blyith, I wald creip on my wame
In froist and snaw in wedder wan and weit
And lay my lyart loikkis under our feit.
This feneit Fox falls and dissimulate,
Maid to this Cok ane cauillatioun.
e ar me think changit and degenerate
Fra our Father of his conditioun,
Of crafty crawing he micht beir the Croun,
For he wald on his tais stand and craw.
This was na le, I stude beside and saw.
With that the Cok upon his tais hie,
Kest up his beik, and sang with all his micht.
(Quod Schir Lowrence) weill said sa mot I the.
e ar our Fatheris Sone and air vpricht.
Bot of his cunning it e want ane slicht.
For (quod the Tod) he wald and haif na dout,
Both wink, and craw, and turn him thryis about.
The Cok infect with wind and falls vaneglo^^,
That money puttis unto confus^oun.
Traisting to win ane greit worschip thairfoir,
Unwarlie winkand wawla^d up and down,
And syne to chant and craw he maid him boun.
And suddandlie be he had crawin ane note,
The Fox was war, and hint him be the throat.
Syne to the woid but tarry with him hyit,
Of that crime haifand bot lytill dout.
With that Pertok, Sprutok, and Toppok cryit.
The Wedow cryit, and with ane cry come out.
Seand the case scho sichit and gaif ane schout.
How murder hay with ane hiddeous beir,
Allace now lost is gentill Chantecleir.
As scho were woid, with money ell and cry,
Ryuand her hair upon her breist can beit,
Syne paill of hew half in ane ecstasy,
Fell down for cair in swoning, and in sweit.
With that the selie hennis left their meit.
And quhill this wife was lyand thus in swoun,
Fell in that case in disputatioun.
Allace (quod Pertok) makand sair murning,
With teiris greit attour her cheikis fell.
one was our drowrie, and our dayis darling,
Our Nich^ingaill, and als our O^lege bell.
Our walkryfe watch us for to warn and tell,
Quhen that Aurora with her curcheis gray,
Put up her heid betuix the nicht and day.
Quha sall our Lemman be? quha sall us leid?
Quhen we are sad quha sall unto us sing?
With his sweit Bill he wald brek us the bre^d
In all this world was their ane kynder thing.
In paramouris he wald do us plesing
At his power as nature did him geif.
Now after him allace how sall we leif?
Quod Sprutok than, Ceis sister of our sorrow
e be to mad for him sic murning mais.
We sall fair weill, I find Sanct Iohne to borrow,
The Proverb sayis, als good lufe cummis as gais.
I will put on my haly dayis claithis,
And make me fresche agane this Iolie May,
Syne chant this sang was never Wedow sa gay.
He was angry and held us ay in aw,
And woundit with the sp^ir of Ielowsie.
Of chalmerglew Pertok, full weill e know
Waistit he was, of Nature cauld and dry.
Sen he is gone thairfoir Sister say I,
Be blyith in baill, for that is best remeid.
Let quik to quik, and deid ga to the deid.
Than Pertok spak, with feneit faith befoir
In lust but lufe he set all his delight.
Sister e wait of sic as him ane scoir
Wald not suffice to flaik our appetyte.
I hecht be my hand sen he is quyte,
Within ane oulk for schame, and I durst speik,
To get ane berne should better claw my breik.
Than Toppok like ane Curate spak full crous,
one was ane verray vengeance from the heuin.
He was sa lous, and sa lecherous.
He had (quod scho) Kittokis ma than seuin.
Bot rychteous God haldand the balandis euin,
Smytis richt sair thocht he be patient
For Adultery, that will them not repent.
Prydefull he was, and ioyit of his sin,
And comptit not for Goddis favor nor feid.
Bot traistit ay to rax, and sa to rin,
Quhill at the last his sinnis can him leid
To schamefull end, and to one suddand deid.
Thairfoir it is the verray hand of God,
That causit him be werryit with the Tod.
Quhen this was said, this Wedow fra her swoun
Start up on fute, and on her kennettis cryit.
How berk Berrie, Bausie, Broun,

Or ellis to me se e cum never agane.
With that but baid they braidit over the bent,
As fire of flint they over the feildis ^^aw,
Full wichtlie they throw woid and watteris went,
And ceissit not schir Lowrence quhill they saw.
Bot quhen he saw the Kennettis cum on raw,
Unto the Cok in mind he said, God sen
That I and thou were fairlie in my den.
Than said the Cok with sum good Spirit inspyri^
Do my counsall and I sall warrant the.
Hungry thou art, and for greit travel tyrit,
Richt faint of force, and may not ferther ^^e.
Swyith turn agane, and say, that I and e
Freindis ar maid, and fellowis for ane eir.
Than will they stint, I stand for it and not steir.
This Tod thocht^e was falls and frivolous,
And had freindis his querrell to defend,
Desauit was be menis richt marvelous.
For falset faileis ay at the latter end.
He start about, and cryit as he was kend.
With that the Cok he braid out of the beuch.
Now Judge e all quhairat Schir Lowrence leuch.
Begylit thus the Tod under the tree
On kneis fell, and said good Chantecleir.
Cum down agane, and I but meit or fey
Salbe our man and seruand for ane eir.
Na falls theif, and reuar, stand not me neir.
My bludie hekill, and my nek sa bla
Hes partit freindschip for ever between us two.
I was unwise that winkit at thy will,
Quhairthrow almaist I loissit had my heid.
I was mair fule (quod he) to be sa still,
Quhairthrow to put my play in to pleid.
Fair on falls theif, God keip me fra thy feid.
With that the Cok over the feildis tuke his flicht,
And in at the Wedowis Luwer couth he licht.
MORALITAS.
NOw worthy folk suppose this be ane Fabill,
And ouerheil^^t with typis ^igurall.
it may e find ane sentence richt agreabill,
Under their feneit termis textuall.
To our purpose this Cok weill may we call,
Nyse proud men, woid, and vane glorious,
Of kin and blude quhilk is presumpteous.
Fie puffed up p^yde, thou is full poysonabill^
Quha fauoris the on force man half an^ fall.
Thy strenth is nocht, thy stule standis vnstabill,
Tak witness of the Feyndis Infernal,
Quhilk houndit down was fra that heuinli^ hall
To Hellis hole, and to that hiddeous house.
Because in pride they were presumpteons.
This feneit Fox may weill be figurate,
To flatteraris richt plesand wordis quhyte.
With falls mening and mind may toxicate.
To leif and le, that settis their haill delight.
All worthy folk at sic should haif despyte.
For quhair is their mair perrillous pestilence,
Nor gif to learis haistelie credence.
Hie wickit mind and Adulatioun
Of sucker sweit haifand the similitude,
Bitter as gall, and full of poysoun,
To traist it is quha cleirlie understood.
For thy as now schortlie to conclude,
Their two sinnis, flattery, and vaneglore,
Ar mannis enemeis: good folk fle tha me their foir.
FINIS.
The Taill how this foirsaid Tod, maid his Confessioun to Freir Uolf Uaitskaith.
LEif we this Wedow glaid I ow assure
Of Chantecleir, mair blyith than I can tell.
And speik we of the subtell adventure.
And destenie that to this Fox befell,
Quhilk durst na mair with waiting Intermell^
Als lang as leme or licht was of the day,
Bot bid and nicht full still lurkand he lay.
Quhill that the Gods of the flude
Phoebus had callit to the harberie.
And Hesperus put up his cluddie heid,
Schawand his lusty wisage in the sky.
Than Lowrence luikit up, quhair he couth ly,
And kest his hand upon his Ee on hicht,
Merry and glaid that cummit was the nicht.
Out of the wod unto ane hill he went,
Quhair he micht se the tuinkling sternis cleir.
And all the Planetis of the firmament,
Their course, and eik their moving in the Spheir.
Sum Retrograde, and sum Stationer.
And of the Zodiak in quhat degree
They were ilk ane, as Lowrence leirnit me.
Than Saturn auld was enterit in Capricorn,
And Iuppiter mouit in Sagittarie.
And Mars up in the Rammis heid was borne.
And Phoebus in the Lyoun forth can carry.
Uenus the Crab, the Moon was in Aquarie,
Mercurius the God of Eloquence
Into the Uirgyn maid his residence.
But Astrolab, Quadrant, or Almanak,
Teichit of nature be Instructioun,
The moving of the heuin this Tod can tak,
Quhat influence and Constellatioun
Was like to fall upon the eirth adoun.
And to him self he said withouttin mair,
Weill worth my Father, that send me to the lai^.
My destenie, and eik my weird I ken,
My auentour is cleirlie to me kend.
With mischief myngit is my mortal Ene,
My misleuing the sooner bot gif I mend.
It is rewiard o^ sin ane schamefull end.
Thairfoir I will ga seik sum Confessor,
And schryit me clean of my sinnis to this hour.
Allace (quod he) richt waryit ar we theifis.
Our lyifis set ilk nicht in adventure.
Our cursit craft full money man mischeuis,
For ever we steill, and ever ar like pure.
In dreid and schame our dayis we Endure.
Syne widdinek, and Crakraip callit als,
And till our hyre hangit up be the hals.
Accusand thus his cankerit conscience,
In to ane Craig he kest about his Ee.
So saw he cummand ane lytill than from hence,
Ane worthy Doctor in divinity
Freir Uolf Uaitskaith in science wonder sle.
To preiche and pray was new cu^mit fra the Cloister,
With Beidis in hand sayand his Pater noster.
Seand this Uolf this wily tratour Tod
On kneis fell, with hude in to his nek.
Welcome my Goistlie Father under God,
(Quod he) with money binge and money bek.
Ha (quod the Uolf) Schir Tod for quha^ effek
Make e sic feir, rise up put on our hude?
Father (quod he) I haif greit cause ^o dude.
e ar Mirror, Lantern, and sicker way,
Should gyde sic sempill folk as me to grace.
our bair feit, and our Russet Cowll of gray,
our lene cheik, our paill pieteous face,
Schawis to me our perfect halines.
For weill were him that anis in his live
Had hap to ow his sinnis for to schryue.
Na selie Lowrence (quod the Uolf) and leuch,
It plesis me that e ar penitent.
Of reif and stouth, Schir, I can tell aneuch,
That causis me full sair for to repent.
Bot Father bide still heir upon the bent,
I ow beseik, and heir me to declair
My conscience, that prikkis me sa sair.
Weill (quod the Uolf) sit down upon thy kne.
And he down bair heid sat full humillie.
And syne began with Benedicite.
Quhen I this saw, I drew ane lytill by.
For it effeiris nouther to heir, nor spy,
Nor to reueill thing said under that seill,
Unto the Tod this Gait the Uolf couth tell.
Art thou contrite, and sorry in thy Spreit
For thy Trespass? Na Schir, I can not doid,
Me think that hennis ar sa honey sweit,
And Lambis flesche that new ar lettin bluid,
For to repent my mind can not concluid,
Bot of this thing, that I haif slane sa few.
Weill (quod the Uolf) in faith thou art ane schrew
Sen thou can not forthink thy wickitnes,
Will thou forbeir in time to cum, and mend.
And I forbeir, how sall I leif allace?
Haifand nane other craft me to defend.
Neid causis me to steill quhair ever I wend.
I eschame to thig, I can not wirk e wait.
it wald I fane pretend to gentill stait.
Weill (quod the Uolf) thou wa^tis pointis tw^
Belangand to perfyte Confessioun.
To the third part of penitence let us ga,
Will thou tak pane for thy transgressioun?
Na Schir considder my Complexioun,
Selie and waik, and of my Nature tender,
Lo, will e se, I am both lene and sklender.
it nevertheless I wald swa it were licht,
Schort and not greuand to my tenderness,
Tak part of pane, fulfill it gif I micht,
To set my selie Saull in way of grace.
Thou sall (quod he) forbeir flesche until Pasche,
To tame this Corpse that cursit Carioun.
And heir I reik the full Remissioun.
I grant thairto, swa e will gif me leif,
To eit puddingis, or laip ane lytill blude,
Or heid, or ^eit, or paynchis let me preif.
In case I falt of flesche in to my fude.
For greit mister I gif the leif to dude,
Twyse in the ^ulk, for neid may haif na Law.
God eild ow Schir, for that Text weill I know
Quhen this was said, the Uolf his wayis went.
The Fox on suit he fure unto the flude,
To fang him fische hailleli^ was his intent.
Bot quhen he saw the watter, and wallis wod,
Astonist all still in to ane stair he stude.
And said, better that I had biddin at hame,
Nor been ane Fischar in the Deuillis Name.
Now man I scraip my meit out of the sand,
And I haif nouth^r boittis, nor it Net.
As he was thus for falt of meit mu^nand,
Luk and about his leuing f^r to get.
Under ane tree he saw ane trip of Gait.
Than was he blyith, and in ane heuch him hid,
And fra the Gait he stall ane ly^ill Kid.
Syne over the heuch unto the sea he hyis,
And tuke the Kid be the hornis twane,
And in the watter outher twyis or thryis
He dowkit him, and till him can he said.
Ga down Schir Kid, cu^ up Schir Salmond agane.
Quhill he was deid syne to the land him dreuch,
And of that new maid Salmond eit aneuch.
Thus fynelie fillit with oung tender meit,
Unto ane derne for dreid he him addressed,
Under ane busk, quhair that the sone can beit.
To beik his breist and vellie he thocht best.
And rekleslie he said quhair he did rest,
Straikand his wame aganis the sonis heit,
Upon this wame set were ane bolt full meit.
Quhen this was said the keipar of the Gait,
Cairfull in heart his Kid was st^llin away,
On euerilk sydefull warlie couth he wait,
Quhill at the last, he saw quhair Lowrence lay.
Ane Bow he bent, ane flane with f^dd^ris gray,
He haillit to the he^d and or he steird,
The Fox he prikkit fast unto the eird.
Now (quod the Fox) allace, and wellaway.
Gorrit I am, and may na forther gang.
Me think na man may sp^ik ane word in play,
Bot now on dayis, in ernist it is ^ane.
He harlit him, and out he drew his flane.
And for his Kid, and other viol^nce,
He tuke his s^yn, and maid ane r^compence.
MORALITAS.
THis suddand deith, and vnprouysit end
Of this false Tod, without prouisioun,
Exempill is exhortand folk to amend,
For dreid of sic ane like confusi^un.
For money now hes good prof^ssioun,
it not repentis, nor for their sinnis greit,
Because ^hay think their lusty life sa ^weit.
Sum been also throw consuetude and ryte,
Uincust with carnal sensuality.
Suppose they be as for the time contryte,
Can not forb^ir, nor fra their sinnis fle.
Use drawis Nature swa in property
Of beist and man, tha^ n^idlingis they man do,
As they o^ lang time ^es been hantit to.
Be war good folk^ and feir this suddane schoit,
Quhilk smy^is sair withouttin resistance.

FINIS.
The Taill of the Sone and Air of the foirsa^^ Fox, callit Fatherwer: Alswa
the Parliament of fourfuttit Beistis, haldin be the Lyoun.
THis foirsaid Fox, that deit for his misdeid,
Had not ane barn was gottin richteouslie,
Till airschip be Law that micht succeid,
Except ane Sone, quhilk in Adultery
He gottin had in purches priuelie.
And till his Name was callit Fatherwar,
That lufit weill with pultrie to tig and tar.
It followis weill be resoun natural,
And gre be gre, of richt comparisoun:
Of evil cummis war: of war cummis werst of all^
Of wrangous geir cummis falls possessioun.
This Fox Bastard of generatioun,
Of verray kind behufit to be falls.
Swa was his Father, and his Grandschir ^ls.
As Nature will seikand his m^it be sent,
Of ca^e he fand his Father is Carioun,
Nakit, new slane, and till him hes he went,
Tuke up his heid, and on his kne fell down,
Thankand greit God of that conclusioun.
And said, now sall I bruke sen I am air,
The boundis quhair thou was wont ^or to repair.
Fie Co^etice unkind, and venomous.
The Sone was fane he fand his Father deid,
Be suddand sch^t, for deidis odious,
That he micht regne, and raxe in till his steid.
Dreid and na thin^ the (...) life to leid,
In thift, and reif, as did his Father befoir^
Bot to the end attent he tuke no moir.
it nevertheless throw Natural piety,
The Carioun upon his bak he ^ais.
Now find I weill this Proverb true (quod he)
Ay rinnis the Fox, als lang as he fute has.
Syne with the Corpse unto ane peitpoit gais,
Of watter full, and kest him in the deip.
And to the Devil he gai^ his banis to keip.
O fulische man plungit in warldlines,
To conqueis warldlie good, gold, and rent.
To put thy Saull in pane, or h^uines,
To rich thy a^r, quhilk after thou art went,
Haif he thy good, he takis bot small tent.
To execute, to do, to satisfy,
Thy letter will, thy det, and legacy.
This Tod to rest him, he pass^t to ane Craig,
And their he hard ane buisteous Bugill blaw.
Quhilk as he thocht, maid all the world to wag.
Ane Unicorne come lansand over ^ne Law.
Than start he up, quhe^ he this hard and law,
With horn in hand, ane bill in br^ist he bure.
Ane Pursephant semelie I ow assure.
Unto ane bank quhair he micht se about,
On euerilk side in haist he culd him hy.
Schot out his voce, full schill, and gaif ane schout.
And on this wyis twyse, or thryse did cry.
With that the beistis in the field thairby,
All merueland, quha^ sic ane thing f^ld mean.
Greitlie aghast they gadderit on ane grieve.
Out of his buist ane bill sone can he bra^d,
And red the Text withouttin tarying.
Commanda^d sil^nce, sadly thus he said.
The Nobill Lyoun, of all beistis the King,
Greting to G^d h^lth eu^rlesting.
To brutall beistis, and Irrational,
I send, as to my subiectis greit and small.
My Celsitude, and hie magnificence,
Lattis ow to wit, that euin incontinent,
Thinkis the morn with Royal diligence,
Upon this hill to hald a^e Parliament.
Straightly thairfoir I g^f commandment,
For to compeir befoir my Tribunal,
Under all pane, and perrell that may fall.
The m^^row come, and Phoebus with his bemis
Con^u^it had the mistie cluddis gray.
The groun^ was grene, and als as gold it glemis,
With gers grow and gudelie, greit, and gay.
The spyce they s^red to spring on euerilk spray.
The Lark, the M^^eis, and the Merl^ full hie.
Sweitlie can sing creip and fra tree to tree.
The Leopardis come with Croun of massy gold,
B^irand they brocht unto that hillis hicht,
With Iaspis Ionit, and Royal Rubeis rold,
And money diueris Dyamontis dicht,
With powis proud ane Paleoun down they picht.
And in that Throne, their sat ane wild Lyoun,
In Rob Royal, with Sceptour, Swerd, and Croun.
After the tennour of the cry befoir,
That gais on all fourfuttit beistis in ^irth.
As they commandit were withouttin moir,
Befoir their Lord the Lyoun they appeirit.
And quhat they were to me as Lowrence leirit.
I sall reheirs ane part of euerilk kind,
Als fer as now occurris to my mind.
The Minotaur, ane Monster marvelous,
Bellerophont that beist of Bastardrie.
The Warwolf, and the Pegase perilous,
Transformit be assent o^ sorcerie.
The Linx the Tiger full of Tirannie:
The Elephant: and eik the Dromedarie:
The Cameill with his Cran nek forth can carry.
The Leopard, as I haif tauld beforne:
The Anteloip: the Sparth forth couth speid:
The payntit Pantheir: and the Unicorne:
The Rayndeir Ran throw Reueir, Ro^e, and Reid.
The Iolie Gillet, and the gentill Steid:
The Ass: the Mule: the Horse of euerilk kind,
The Da: the Ra: the hornit Heart: the Hynd.
The Bull: the Beir: the Bugill: and the Bair:
The Tame Cat: Uildcat: and the Uildwod Swyne:
The Hardbakkit Hurcheoun: and the Hirpla^d Hair:
Both Otter, and Aip: and Pennit Porcupyne:
The Gukit Gait: the selie Scheip: the Swyne:
The wyld Once: the Buk: the U^lteran^ Brok:
The Fowmart, with the Fibert forth can flok.
The gray Grewhound, with Sleuthou^d forth can slide,
With Doggis all diverse and different.
The Rat^oun ran, the Glebard forth can glyde.
The quhrynand Quhitret, with the Quhaisill went,
The Feitho that hes furrit money fent.
The Mertrik: with the Cunning: and the Con:
The Bouranbane: and eik the Lerioun.
The Marmysset: the Mowdewaxt couth leid,
Because that Nature denyit had her sicht.
Thus dressit they all forth, for dreid of deid,
The Mu^k, the lytill Mous with all her micht,
With haist scho haikit unto that hill of hicht.
And money kind of beistis I couth not know,
Besoir their Lord the Lyoun they loutit law.
Seeing their beistis all at his bidding boun,
He gaif ane braid, and lukit him about.
Than flatlingis to his feit they fell all down,
For dreid of deith, they droupit all in dout.
He lukit quhen that he saw them lout,
And bad them with ane countenance full sweit,
Be not effeirit, bot stand up on our feit.
I let ow wit, my micht is merciabill,
And steiris nane that are to me prostrait.
Angry, austerne, and als vnamyabill,
To all that stand^ray ar to mine estait.
I rug, I reif, all beistis that makis debait.
Aganis the micht of my Magnificence,
Se nane pretend to pride in my presence.
My Celsitude, and my hie Majesty,
With micht, and mercy myngit ^all be ay.
The lawest heart I can full sone up hie,
And make him master over ow all I may.
The Dromedarie gif he will make deray,
The greit Cameill, thochthe were never sa ^rous,
I can him law als lytill as ane Mous.
Se neir be twenty mylis quhair I am,
The Kid ga saiflie be the gaittis side.
The Tod Lowrie luke not to the lam.
Na reuand beistis nouther Ryn, nor ride.
They couchit all after that this was cryde.
The Justice bad the Court for to gar fence,
The sutis callit, and foirfalt all absence.
The Panther with his payntit Coit Armor
Fensit the Court, as of the Law effeirit.
Than Tod Lowrie lukit quhair he couth lour,
And start on fute, all stonist and all steird,
Ryifand his hair, he cryit with ane reird,
Quaikand for dreid, and sichand couth he say,
Allace this hour, allace this dulefull day.
I wait this suddand Semblie that I se,
Haifand the pointis of ane Parliament,
Is maid to mar sic misdoaris as me.
Thairfoir gif I me schaw I will be schent,
I will be socht, and I be red absent.
To bide, or fle, it makis not remeid,
All is alyke, their followis not bot deid.
Perplexit thus in his heart can he mean,
Throw falset how he micht him self defend.
His Hude he drew laich attour his Ene,
And winkand with ane Eye forth he wend.
Clinscheand he come, that he micht not be kend,
And for dreddour that he should been arreist,
He playit bukhude behind, fra beist to beist.
O fylit Spr^it, and cankerit Conscience,
B^foir ane Roy Reneit with r^chteousnes,
Blakin^it cheikis, and schamefull countenance.
Fa^rw^ill thy fame defylit for ay is,
The Ph^^n^mie, the ^auour of thy face,
For thy defense is foull and disfigurate,
Brecht to the licht blasit, blunt, and blait.
Be thou atteichit with thift, or with tressoun,
For thy misdeid wrangous, and wickit fay.
Thy their changis Lowrence^ thou man luke down,
Thy worschip of this world is went away.
Luke to ^his Toid how he was in effray
And fle the filth of falset I the reid,
Quhairthrow their fallowis syn, and schameful deid.
Comperand thus befoir their Lord and King.
In ordour set as to their estait effeird.
Of euerilk kind he gart ane part furthbring,
And awfullie he spak, and at them speird,
Gi^ their was any kind of beistis in erd,
Absent, and tha^ to gart them deiplie sweir,
And they said nane, except ane Stude gray Meir.
Ga make ane message sone unto that Stude,
The Court than cryit, now see quha sall it be,
Cum ^urth Lowrie l^rkand under thy hude,
Aa Schir, mercy, lo I haifbot ane Ee,
Hurt in the heid, and cruikit as e may se.
The Uolf is better in Ambassatrie,
And mair cunning in Clergy fer than I.
Rampand he said, gafurth brybouris ^aith.
And they to ga withouttin tarying,
Over Ron and Rute they xan togidder raith,
And ^and the M^ir at her meit in the morning.
Now (quod the Tod^ Madame cum to the King,
The Court is callit, and e ar Contumax,
Let be Lowrence (quod scho) our Courtly Knax.
Maistres (quod he) cum to the Court e mon,
The Lyoun hes commandit so in deid.
Schir Tod tak e the Flyrdome, and the Fon,
I haif respite ane eir, and e will reid.
I can not spell (quod he) sa God me speid,
Heir is the Uolf, ane Nobill Clerk at all,
And of this Message is maid principal.
He is Autentik, and ane man of age,
And hes greit practik of the Chancellarie.
Let him ga luke, and reid our Privilege,
And I sail stand, and beir witness ow by.
Quhair is thy Respite (quod the Uolf) in hy?
Schir it is heir under my hufe weill hid.
Hald up thy heill (quod he) and so scho did.
Thocht he was blindit with pride, it he presumis
To luke ^oun law, quhair that her letter lay.
With that the Meir gird him vpou the gumis,
And straik the hattr^ll of his heid away,
Half out of lyif their lenand down he lay.
Allace (quod Lowrence) Lupe, thou art loist.
His cunning (quod the Meir) was worth sum coist.
Lowrence (quod scho) will thou luke on my letter,
Sen that the Uolf na thing their of can wyn?
Na be Sanc^ Bryde (quod he) me think it better,
To sleip in haill, nor in an^ hurt skyn.
Ane skrow I fand, and this was writtin in,
For five schillingis I wald no^ anis forfault him,
Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.
With brokin skap, and bludie cheikis reid,
This wretchit Uolf weipand, thus on he went,
Of his mean markand to get remeid,
To tell the King the case was his Intent.
Schir (quod the Tod) bide still upon this bent,
And fra our bro wis wesche away the blude.
And tak ane drink, for it will do ow good.
To feche watter this frandfull Fox forth fure,
Sydelingis abak he socht unto ane slyke.
On case he meittis cummand fra the mure,
Ane Trip of Lambis dansand on ane dyke.
This Tratour Tod, this Tirrane, and this Tyke,
The fattest of this flock, he fellit hais.
And eit his fill, syne to the Uolf he gais.
They drank togidder, and syne their Journey takis,
Befoir the King, syne kneillit on their kne.
Quhair is one Meir, Schir Tod, was Contumax?
Than Lowrence said, my Lord, speir not at me.
Speir at our Doctor of Divinity,
With his reid Cap can tell ow weill aneuch.
With that the Lyoun, and all the laif they leuch.
Tell on the cais, now Lowrence let us heir.
This witty Uolf (quod he) this Clerk of age,
On our behalf he bad the Meir compeir.
And scho allegit to ane privilege,
Cum neir, and se, and e sall haif our wage.
Because he red her respite plane and weill,
one reid Bonat scho raucht him with her he^^^.
The Lyoun said, be one reid Cap I ken,
This Taill is true, quha tent unto it takis.
The greitest Clerkis are not the wysest men.
The hurt of ane happy the other makis.
As they were carpand in this cais, and Knakis,
And all the Court in merines and in gam.
Swa come the ow the Mother of the Lam.
Befoir the Justice on her kneis fell,
Put out her playnt on this wyis woefully.
This harlet huresone, and this hound of hell.
Deuorit hes my Lamb full doggitlie,
Within ane mile, in contrair to our cry.
For Goddis lufe, my Lord, gif me the Law
Of this lurker, with that Lowrence let draw.
Bide (quod the Lyoun) Lymmer let us se,
Gi^ it be suthe the selie ow hes said.
Aa Souerane Lord, saif our mercy (quod he.)
My purpois was with him for to haif playid.
Causles he fled as he had been effrayid,
For dreid of deith, he duschit over ane dyke,
And brak his nek. Thou leis (quod scho) falls tyke.
His deith be practik may be preuit eith,
Thy gorrie gumis, and thy bludie snout.
The woll, the flesche it stikkis on thy teith,
And that is evidence aneuch but dout.
The Justice bad ga cheis ane Assyis about.
And so they did, and ^and that he was falls
Of Murder, thilt, pyking, and tressoun als.
They band him fast, the Justice bad bel^if
To git the dome, and tak of all his claithis.
The Uolf that new maid Doctor couth him schryif,
Syne forth him led and to the Gallous gais,
And at the ledder fute his leif he tais.
The Aip was Boucher, and bad him sone ascend.
And hangit him, and thus he maid his end.

Thinkand daily to get mair leuing.
Sum for to reull: and sum to raxe and Ring.
Sum gadderis geir: sum gold: sum other good
To win this world, sum wirkis as they were wod.
The Meir is Men of good conditioun^
As Pilgrymes walkand in this wilderness
Approuand that for richt Religioun
Their God only to pleis in euerilk place,
Abstractit from this warldis wre^chitnes,
Fechtand with lust, presumptioun and pride,
And fra this world in mind ar mortyfyde.
This Uolf I likkin to Sensuality,
As quhen like brutall beistis we accord
Our mind all to this warldis vanity,
Lyking to tak, and loif him as our Lord.

And for thy Saull their is na better thing.
Her Hufe I likkin to the thocht of deid.

T^ow may brek Sensualiteis heid,
And fleschire lust away fra the sall fle,
Fra thou begin thy mind to mortify.
Salomonis saying thou may persaif heirin,

Beirand to mind money thochtis vane,
Assaultand men with sweit persuasionis,

And suddand deith draw neir with panis sore,

O Mediator merciful, and meik,

Thy Celsi^ude may humillie we beseik,

And help us up unto thy heavenly hall,
In gloir, quhair we ^ay se the face of God.

FINIS.
The Taill of the Scheip, and the Doig.
^ope ane Taill puttis in memory,
(...) How that ane Doig, because that he was pure,
(...). Callit ane Scheip to the Consistory,
^ne certane breid fra him for to recure.
Ane fraudfull Uolf was Judge that time, and bure
Author^tie, and Iurisdic^ioun.
And on the Scheip send forth ane strait summoun.
For be the use, and course, and commoun style,
On this manner maid his Citatioun.
I Master Uolf partles of fraud and gyle,
Under the pauis of hie Suspensioun,
Of greit Cursing and Interdictioun,
Schir Scheip, I charge the, for to compeir,
And answer to ane Doig befoir me heir.
Schir Corbie Rauin was maid Apparitour,
Quha pykit had full money Scheipis Ee.
The charge hes taken, and on the letteris bure,
Summonit the Scheip befoir the Uolf, that he
P^remptourlie within two dayis, or three,
Compeir under the panis in this bill,
To ^eir quhat Perrie Doig will say the till.
This Summondis maid befoir witness anew,
The Rauin as to his office weill effeird,
Indorsat hes the write, and on he flew.
The selie Scheip durst lay na mouth on cird,
Till he befoir the awful Judge appeird.
The hour of cause, quhilk that the Judge vsi^ than,
Quhen Hesperus to schaw his face began.
The Fox was Clerk, and Noter in the cause.
The Gled, the Graip at the Bar couth stand,
As Aduocatis expert in to the Lawis,
The Doggis pley togidder tuke on hand,
Quhilk were confidderit straightly in ane band,
Aganis the Scheip to procure the sentence.
Thocht it was falls they had n^ conscience.
The Clerk callit the Scheip, and he was their.
The Aduocatis on this wise couth propone.
Ane certane breid, worth five schilling or mair,
Thou aw the Doig, of quhilk the ter^ne is gone.
Of his a win held but Advocate allone,
The Scheip ^^ysitlie gaif answer in the case.
Heir I declyne the Judge, the time, the place.
This is my cause, in motive and effect.
The Law sayis, it is richt perrillous,
Till enter in pl^y befoir ane Judge suspect.
And e Schir U^lf, hes been richt odious
To me, for with our Tus^is ravenous.
H^s slane full money Kinn^smen of mine.
Tha^rfoir Judge, as suspect, I ow declyne.
And schortlie, of this Court e memberis all,
Both Ass^ssou^is, Clerk, and ^duoca^e,
To me, and mine ar enemeis mortal,
And ay hes been, thoch^ I mycht not it lat.
The place is ^er, the time is inspera^e.
Quhairfoir na Judge should sit in Consistory,
Sa lait at euin, I ow accuse for thy.
Quhen that the Judge on this wise was accusit,
He ^ad the par^eis ^heis with ane assent,
Two Arbiteris, as in the Law is vsit,
For to declair, and gif Arbitrament,
Qubidder the scheip should answer in Judgment,
Befoir the Uolf: and so they did but weir,
Of quhome the Namis efterwart e sall heir.
The Beir, the Brok, the matter tuke on hand,
For to d^cyde, gif this exceptioun
Was of na strenth, nor lauchfullie mycht stand.
And thairupon as Iugis they sat down,
And held ane lang quh^le disputatioun,
Seikand full money Decre^t^is of the Law,
And Glosis als, the verity to know.
Of Civil Law volumis full money they reuolue,
The Codies, and Digestes new and ald.
Contrait, Prostrait Argumentis they resolve.
Sum obiecting, and sum can hald.
For prayer, or price, trow e that they wald fald?
Bot had the gloss, and Text of the Decreis,
As true Iugis. I beschrew them ay that leis.
Schortlie to make ane end of this debait,
The Arbiteris than did sweir full plane.
The sentence gaif, and process fulminat,
The Scheip should pas befoir the Uolf agane,
And end his pley. Than was he nathing fane,
For fra their sentence couth he not appeill.
On Clerkis I do it, gif this sentence was leill.
The Scheip agane befoir the Uolf d(...)eit,
But Advocate abasitlie couth stand.
Up ^ais the doig, and on the Scheip thus pleneit,
Ane soume I payit ha^f b^t^^ the hand,
For certane breid thairto a^e Borrow he fand.
That wrango^slie the Scheip did hand the breid,
Quhilk he denyit: and their began the pleid.
And quhen the Scheip this stuf had contestait,
The Justice in the cause forth can proceid.
Lowrence the actis, and the process wrait,
And thus the pley unto the end they speid.
This Cursit Court corruptit all for meid,
Aganis good faith, Law, and ^ik conscience,
For this false Doig pronuncit the sentence.
And it till put to executioun,
The Uolf chargit the Scheip without delay,
Under the panis of Interdictioun,
The soume of silver, or the breid to pay.
Of this sent^nce (allace) quhat sall I say?
Quhilk dampnit hes the selie Innocent,
And Iustifyit the wrangous Judgment.
The Scheip dreidand mair executioun,
Obeyand to the sentence, he couth tak
His way unto ane Merchand of the Town,
And sauld the wo^, that he bure on his bak.
Syne bocht the br^id, and to the Doig cou^h make
Reddie payment^ as it commandit wa^.
Nakit and bair ^yne to the field couth pas.
MORALITAS.
THis selie Scheip may present the figure,
Of pure commounis that daily is oppressed,
Be Tirrane men, quhilkis settis all their cure,
Be falls menis, to make ane wrang conqueist,
In hope, this present life should ever l^st.
Bot all begylit, they will in schort time ^^d,
And ef^er deith to lest and panis wend.
This Uolf, I likkin to a^e Schiref s^ou^,
Quhilk byis ane forfalt at the Kingis hand.
And hes with him ane cursi^ Assyis about,
And dytis all the pure men up on land.
Fra the Crownar haif laid on him his wand,
Thocht he were true as ever was Sanct Iohne,
Slane sa^l he be, or with the Judge compone.
This Ra^i^, I likkin to ane falls Crownar,
Quhilk hes ane portioun of the Indictment,
And pass^s ^urth befoir the Justice Air,
All misdoaris to bring to Judgment.
Bot luke gif he was of ane true Intent,
To Scraip out Iohne, and write in Will, or Wat,
And swa ane bud at both the parteis tak.
Of this false Tod of quhilk I spak befoir,
And of this Gled, quhat ^hay micht signify.
Of their nature, as now I sp^ik no moir.
Bot o^ this Scheip, and o^ his cairfull cry,
I sall reh^irs, for as I passi^ by,
Quhair that he ^ay on cais I lukit down,
And hard him make sair lamentatioun.
Allace (quod he) this cursit Consistory,
In middis of the winter now is maid,
Quhen Boreas with blaitis bi^te^lie,
And hard froistis, ^hir ^ouris down can faid.
On bankis bair now may I make na baid.
And with that word in to a^e coif he crap,
Fra sair wedder, and noistis him to hap.
Quaik and for cauld, sair murnand ay amang,
Ke^t up his Ee unto the ^e^inu^^ hicht.
And said, Lord God, quhy sleipis thou sa lang:
Walk, and discern my cause groundit on richt.
Se how I am be fraud, maistrie, and slicht,
Peillit full bair, and so is money one,
Now in this world, richt wonder wobegone.
Se how this cursit sone of couetice,
Loist hes both lawtie, and eik Law.
Now few, or nane will execute Justice,
In falt of quhome, the pure man is ouerthraw.
The verity suppois the Judge it know,
He is so blindit with affec^ioun,
But dreid for micht he lettis the richt go down.
Seis thou not (Lord) this world ouerturnit is,
As quha wald change good gold in leid or tyn?
The pure is peillit, the Lord may do na mis.
And Simonie is haldin for na syn.
Now is he blyith with okker may may win.
Gentrice is slane, and piety is ago.
Allace (good Lord) quhy tholis thou it so?
Thou tholis this euin for our greit offense,
Thou sendis us troubill, and plaigis soir.
As hunger derth, greit weir, or Pestilence.
Bot few amendis now their life thairfoir.
We pure pepill as now may do no moir,
Bot pray to the, sen tha^ we are oppressed
In to this eirth, grant us in heuin good rest.
FINIS.
The Taill of the Lyonn, and the Mous.
IN middis of June, that sweit seasoun,
Quhen that ^air Phoebus with his b^^nis bricht,
Had dryit up the dew fra daill and down,
And all the land maid with his bemis lich^.
In ane morning betuix mid day, and nicht,
I raise, and put all sleuth, and sleip aside.
And to ane wod I went allone but gyde.
Sweit was the smell of flouris quhyte and reid.
The noyes of birdis richt delitious.
The b^wis braid blomit abone my heid.
The ground growand with gers gracious.
Of all plesance, that place was plenteous,
With sweit odouris, and birdis harmony,
The Murning Myld, my mirth was mair for thy.
The Rosis reid arrayit on Rone and Ryce.
The Prymeros, and the Purpour Uiola.
To heir it was ane point of Paradic^,
Sic Mirth the Mauis, and the Merle couth ma.
The blossuminis blyith brak up on bank and bra,
The smell of H^rbis, and of foullis cry,
Contending quha should haif the victory.
Me to conserve than fra the sonis hei^,
Under the schadow of ane Hawthorne grene,
I lenit ^oun amang the flouris sweit,
Syne cled my heid, and closit ba^th my Ene.
On sleip I fell amang their bewis been.
And in my dr^me, me thocht come throw the schaw,
The fairest man that ever be^oir I saw.
His gown was of ane claith, als quhyte as milk.
His Chemeis was of Chambelo^e Purpour Broun.
His hude of (...) ^rit weill with silk,
On (...) wyis until his gir^i^^ down.
His Bonat round, and of the auld fa^^onn.
His heid was quhyte, his Ene was greit and gray,
With loaker hair, quhilk over his schulderis lay.
Ane Roll of paper in his hand he bair.
Ane Swannis pen stikand under his eir.
Ane Inkhorne, with ane pretty gilt Pennair,
Ane bag of silk, all at his belt can beir.
Thus was he gudelie graithit in his geir,
Of stature large, and with ane feirfull face.
Euin quhair I lay he come ane sturdie pace.
And said, God speid my sone: and I was fan^
Of that couth word, and of his cumpanie.
With reverence I ^alus^t him agane,
Welcome Father: and he sat down me by.
Displeis ow not my good master, thocht I
Demand our birth, our faculty, and name,
Quhy e come heir, or quhair e dwell at hame?
My sone (said he) I am of gentill blude.
My native land is Rome withouttin nay.
And to the Town first to the Sculis I ude,

For quhat is it worth to tell ane feneie taill,

Now in this world me think richt few or nane,

Ane moral Fabill e wald dene to say.
Quha wait, nor I may leir and beir away
Sum thing thairby heirefter may auaill?

The end of the Prolog, and beginnis the Taill.
ANe Lyoun at his Pray vetray foirrun^
To recreat his limmi^ and to re^^,
Beikand his breist, and ^ellie at the Sone^
Under ane tree lay in the fair Forr^st.
Swa come ane trip of Myis ^ut of (...),
Rich tai^ and trig, all dansand in ane gy^s,
And over the Lyoun thy da^sit twyis, or thryis.
He lay so still, the Myis was not effeird,
Bot to and fro out over him tuke their trace.
Sum tirllit at the Campis of his b^ird,
Sum spairit not to claw him on the face,
Merry and gla^d, thus dansit they ane space,
Till at the last, the Nobill Lyoun woke,
And with his pow, the master Mous he tuke.
Scho gaif ane cry, and all the laif aghast,
Their dansing left, and hid them heir and their.
Scho that was taken, cryit and weipit fast.
And said allace oftymes that scho come their.
Now am I taken ane woeful presonair,
And for my gilt traistis Incontinent,
Of life and deith, to thoill the Judgment.
Than spak the Lyoun to that cairfull Mous.
Thou Catiue wreiche, and vile unworthy thing,
Over malapert, and eik presumpteous
Thou was, to make out over me thy tripping.
Knew thou not weill. I was both Lord and King
Of beistis all. es (quod the Mous) I know.
Bot I misane^, because e lay so law.
Lord, I b^seik thy Kingly Royalty,
Heir quha^ I say, and tak in patience.
Con^idder first my ^imple poverty,
And syne thy mych^^e hie Magnifice^ce.
Se als how thingis done of Negligence,
Nouther of malice, nor of pr^sumptioun,
The rather should ha^f grace and Remi^sioun.
We were repleit, and had greit aboundan^^
Of alkin thingis, sic as to us effeird.
The sweit seldun prouokit us to dance,
And make sic mirth as nature to us leird.
e lay so still, and law upon the eird,
That be my saull, we weind e had been deid.
Ellis wald we not haif dancit over our heid.
Thy falls excuse, the Lyoun said agane,
Sall not auaill ane myte I vnder^a.
I put the case, I had been deid, or s^ane,
And syne my skyn been stoppit full of s^ra.
Thocht thou had found my figure lya^d swa,
Because it bair the prent of my persoun,
Thou should for feir on kneis haif fallin down.
For thy trespass thou sall make na defense,
My Nobill persoun thus to vilipend.
Of thy feiris, nor thy awin negligence,
For to excuse thou can na cause pretend.
Thairfoir thou suffer sall ane schamefull end,
And deith, sic as to tressoun is decreit,
Upon the Gallous hangit be the feit.
Na mercy Lord, at thy gentrice I ase,
As thou art King of beistis Coronat,
Sober thy wraith, and let it ouerpas^
And make thy mind to merry Inclynat.
I grant offense is done to thine estait,
Quhairfoir I worthy am to suffer deid,
Bot gif thy cumlie mercy reik remeid.
In every Judge mercy and reuth ^uld be,
^s ^ssessouris, and Collateral.
With out mercy Justice is cruelty,
As said is in the Lawis special.
Quhen Rigor sittis in the Tribunal,
The equity of Law quha may sustene?
Richt few or nane but mercy gang between.
Al^wa e know the honor Triumphall,
Of all Uictour, upon the strenth dependis
Of his compair, quhilk manly in battle

Quhat price or loving quhen the battle endis,
Is said of him, that ouercummis ane man,
Him to defend quhilk nouther may, nor can?
Ane thousand Myis to kill, and eik deuoir,
Is lytill manheid to ane strange Lyoun.
Full lytill worschip haif e wyn thairfoir,
To quhais strenth is na comparisoun:
It will degraid sum part of our renoun,
To sla ane Mous, quhilk may make na defense,
Bot as^and mercy at our excellence.
Also, it semis not our Celsitude,
Quhilk vsis daily meittis delitious,
To fyle our teith, or lippis with my blude,
Quhilk to our stomok is contagious.
Unhailsum meit is of ane sarte Mous,
And that namely until ane strange Lyoun,
Uont till be fed with gentill Uennisoun.
My life is lytill worth, my deith is les.

Supple our hienes beand in distres.
For often is seen, ane man of small stature,
Reskewit hes ane Lord of hie honor,
Keipit that was in point to be ouerthrawin.
Throw misfortune, sic case may be our awin.
Quhen this was said, the Lyoun his language
Paissit, and thocht according to ressoun.
And gart mercy his cruel Ire assuage,
And to the Mous grantit Remissioun.
Oppinnit his Poll, and scho on kneis fell down,
And both her handis unto the heuin vpheld,
Cryand, Almychtie God mot ow foreild.
Quhen scho was gone, the Lyoun held to hunt,
For he had nocht, bot leuit on his Pray
And flew both tayme and wyld, as he was wont,
And in the cuntrie maid ane greit deray.
Till at the last, the pepill land the way,
This cruel Lyoun how that they mycht tak.
Or Hempyn cordis strange Nettis couth they make.
And in ane Rod, quhair he was wont to ryn,
With Raipis rude fra tree to tree it band.
Syne kest ane Range on raw the woid within,
With hornis blast, and Kennettis fast calland.
The Lyoun fled, and throw the Ron rynnand,
Fell in the Net, and hankit fute and heid,
For all his strenth he couth make na remeid.
Uelterand about with hiddeous rummissing,
Quhyle to, quhyle fra, quhil he mycht succor get.

The mair he ^a^g, the faster was the Net,
The Raipis rude was sa about him knet,
On euerilk side, that succor saw h^ nane,
B^t still ^yand, and murnand maid his mane.
O lamit Lyoun liggand heir ^a law,
Quhair is the mycht of thy Magnificence?
Of quh^me all brutall beist in eird stude aw,
And dred to lu^e upon thy Excellence.
But hoip, or help, but succor or defense,
In bandis strange heir man I ly (allace)
Till I be ^lane, I se nane other grace.
Their is na wy that will my harmis wreik,
Nor creature do confort to my Croun.
Quha sall me ^ute? quha sall my bandis brek?
Quha sall me put fra pane of this Presoun?
Be he had maid this lamentatioun,
Throw adventure, the lytill Mous come neir,
And of the Lyoun hard the pietuous beir.
And suddandlie it come in till her mind,

And said, now were I falls, and richt unkind,
Bot gif I quit sumpart of thy gentrice

To her fellowis, and on them fast can cry.
Cum help, cum help, and they come all in ^y.

And schuir the raipis of the Mast in ^chunder.

And thankit them, syne on his way is gone^

Quhen Columbie up ke^kis throw the clay,
Quhilk fleit was befoir with frostis fell.
The Mauis, and the Merle beginnis to mell:
The Lark on loft, with other birdis small,
Than drawis forth fra derne, over down and daill.
That samin seasoun, in to ane soft morning,
Richt blyith that bitter blastis were ago,
Unto the wod to se the flouris spring,
And heir the Maueis sing, and birdis mo.
I passit forth, syne lukit to and fro
To se the Soill, that was richt sessonabill,
Sappie, and to resaif all seidis abill.
Moving thusgait greit mirth I tuke in mind
Of lauboraris to se the besines.
Sum makand dyke, and sum the pleuch can wynd,
Sum sawand seidis fast from place to place.
The Harrowis hoppand in the saweris trace.
It was greit Joy to him that lufit corn,
To se them laubour, both at euin and morn.
And as I baid under ane bank full been,
In heart greitlie reiosit of that sicht.
Unto ane hedge, under ane Hawthorne grene
Of small birdis their come ane ferlie flicht.
And down belyif can on the leifis licht,
On euerilk side about me quhair I stude,
Richt marvelous ane mekill multitude.
Amang the quhilkes, ane Swallow loud couth cry,
On that Hawthorne hie in the croip sittand.
O e Birdis, on leiffis, heir me by,
e sall weill know, and wyistie understand,
Quhair danger is, or perrell appeirand,
It is greit wisdom to provide befoir,
It to deuoid, for dreid it hurt ow moir.
Schir Swallow (quod the Lark) agane and len^h,
Quhat haif e seen, that causis ow to dreid^
Se e one Churll (quod scho) ^eond one pleu^h,
Fast sawand hemp, lose, and linget seid.
one lint will grow in lytill time in deid,
And thairof will one Churll his Nettis make,
Under the quhilk he thin^is us to tak.
Thairfoir I reid we pas quhen he is gone,
At euin, and with our naillis scharp and small,
Out of the eirth scraip we one seid anon,
And ^it it up, for gif it growis, we ^all
Haif cause to weip heirefter ane and all.
Se we remeid thairfoir forth with Instante,
Nam leuius ledit quicquid preuiu^imus ante.
For Cle^kis sayis, it is nocht sufficient,
To considder that is befoir thine Ee.
Bot prudence is ane inwart Argument,
That garris ane man provide and foirse,
Quhat good, quhat evil is liklie for to be,
Of euerilk thing euin at the final end.
And swa fra perrell the better him defend.
The Lark lauchand yt Swallow thus couth scorn,
And said scho fischit lang befoir the Net.
The barn is eith to busk that is unborn.
All growis nocht, that in the ground is set.
The nek to stoup quhen it the straik sall get,
Is sone aneuch: deith on the ^ayest fall.
Thus scornit they the Swallow ane and all.
Despy^ing thus her helthsum document
The foullis ferlie tuke their flicht anon,
Sum with ane bir they braidit over the bent:
And sum agane ar to the grene woid gone.
Upon the land quhair I was left allone,
I tuke my club, and hamewart couth I carry
Swa ferliaud, as I had seen ane farie.
Thus passit forth quhill Inn that Iolie tide,
And seidis that were sawin of beforne,
Were growin hie, that Hairis mycht them hyde:
And als the Quail craikand in the corn.
I mouit forth betuix midday and morn,
Unto the hedge under the Hawthorne grene,
Quhair I befoir the said birdis had seen.
And as I stude be adventure and case,
The samin birdis as I haif said ow air,
I hoip, because it was their hanting place,
Mair of succor, or it mair solitair,
They lychtit down: and quhen they lychtit war^
The Swallow swyith put forth an^ pietuous pyme.
Said, woe is him can not bewar in time.
O blind birdis, and full of negligence,
Unmyndfull of our a win prosperity.
Lift up our sicht, and tak good aduertence,
Luke to the Lint, that growis on one le.
one is the thing I bad forsooth, that we
Quhill it was seid ^uld rute forth of the eird.
Now is it Lint: now is it hie on breird.
Go it, quhi^l it is tender and small,
And pull it up, let it na mair Incres.
My fl^sche growis, my body quaikis all,
Thinkand on it I may not sleip in peis.
They cryit all, and bad the Swallow ceis.
And said, one Lint heirefter will do good,
For linget is to lytill birdis ^ude.
We think qu^en that one lin^ bollis ar ryip,
To make us Feist, and ^ill us of the ^eid,
Magre one Churll, and on it sing and pyip.
Weill (quod the Swallow) freindis hardilie be^d^
Do as e will, bot certane sai^ I dreid,
Heirefter e sall find als sour, as sweit,
Qnhen e ar speldi^ on one Carlis speit.
The awner of one lint, ane fouler is,
Richt cautelous, and full of subteltie.
His pray full sendill tymis will he mis,
Bot gif we ^irdis all the warter be.
Full money of our Kin he hes gart de
And thocht it bot ane sport to spill their blude.
God keip me fra him, and the halie Rude.
Their small birdis haifand bot lytill thoch^
Of perrell, that micht fall be adventure,
The counsel of the Swallow s^t at nocht,
Bot ^uke than flicht, and forth ^ogidder fure.
Sum to the wo^d, sum markit to the Mure.
I tuke my stat, quhen this was said and done,
And walkit hame, for it drew neir the none.
The Lint ryipit, the Carll pullit the Line:
Rippillit the bollis, and in beitis set.
It steipit in the but^, and dryit syne:
And with ane Betill knokkit it, and b^t^
Syne swingillit it weill, and hekkillit in the flet.
His wy^e it span, and twynit it in to threid.
Of quh^lk the Fowlar Nettis maid in deid.
The winter come, the wickit wind can blaw:
The woddis grene were wallowit with the weit^
Both firth and fell with froistis were maid faw,
Slonkis and slaik maid s^idderie with the ^^eit.
The foullis fair for falt they fell of feit.
On vewis bair it was na bute to bide,
Bot hy^t unto housis them to hyde.
Sum in the barn, sum in the stak of corn,
Their lugeing tuke, and maid their re^idence.
The Fowlar saw, and greit a^this hes sworne^
They should be taken trew^^e for their expense.
His Nettis hes he set with diligence,
And in the snaw he sch^l^t hes ane plane,
And heillit it all over with calf agane.
Their small birdis seand the calf was gl^^d.
Trowand it had been ^orne, they ly^h^it down.
Bot of the Ne^tis na presume they had,
Nor of the^ Fowlaris falls Intentio^n.
To scraip, and seik their meit they maid them bo^^.
The Swallow on ane lytill branche nei^ by^
Dreid^nd for ^yle, thus loud on th^me c^^th (...).
In to that calf scraip quhill our naillis bleid,
Their is na corn, e laubour all in vane.
Trow e one Churll for piety will ow ^eid.
Na, na, he hes it heir layit for ane tra^e.
Remove I reid, or ellis e will be slane.
His Nettis he hes set full privily.
Reddie to draw: in time be war for thy.
Greit fule is he that puttis in dangeir
His life, his honor, for ane thing of nocht.
Greit fule is he, that will not glaidlie heir
Counsall in time, quhill it auaill him mocht.
Greit fule is he, that hes na thing in thocht,
Bot thing pr^sent^ and after quhat may fall,
Nor of the end hes na memorial.
Their small birdis for hunger famischit neir,
Full besie scraipand for to seik their fude.
The counsall of the Swallow wa^d not heir.
Supp^is their la^bour did them lytill good.
Quhen scho their fuluche hartis understood
Sa Indurate, up in ane tree scho flew.
With that this Churll over them his Nettis drew.
Allace it was great heart ^air for to se
That bludie Boucheour bet they birdis down.
And for ^ill heir, q^hen they w^s^ weill to de,
Their cairfull sang and lamentatioun^
Sum with ane stat he straik to eirth on swoun:
Of sum the he^d he straik^ of sum he (...) the crag^
Sum half on ^y^e^ he stoppit in his ^ag^
And quhen the S^allow saw that they were deid.
Lo (quod ^cho) thus it happinnis money syis,
On them that will not tak counsall, nor reid
Of Prudent men, or Clerkis that are wyis.
This greit perrell I ta^ld them mair than thryis.
Now ar they deid, and woe is me thairfoir.
Scho tuke her flicht, bot I her saw no moir.

FINIS.
The T^ill of the Uolf, that gat the Nekhering, throw the wrinkis of the Fox,
that begylit the Cadgear.
QUhylum their wynnit in ane wilderness,
(As mine Author expressie can declair)
Ane reuand Uolf, that leuit upon ca^s
On bestiall, and maid him weill to fair.
Was nane sa big about him he wald spair,
And he war hungry, outher for favor, or feid,
Bot in his breith he weryit them to deid.
Swa happinnit him in watching as he went,
To meit ane Fox in middis of the way.
He him foirsaw, and feneit to be schent,
And with ane bek, he bad the Uolf good day.
Welcum to me (quod he) thou Russell gray.
Syne loutit down, and tuke him be the hand.
Rise up Lowrence, I leif the for to stand.
Quhair hes thou been this sesoun fra my sicht^
^how ^all ^eir office, and my Stewart be.
For thou can knap down Caponis on the nicht,
And lourand law thou can gar hennis de.
Schir (said the Fo^e) that ganis nocht for me.
And I am raid, gif they me se on far,
That at my figure, beist and bird will s^ar.
Na (quod the Uolf) thou can in covert creip
Upon thy wame, and hint them be the heid.
And make ane suddand schow upon ane scheip,
Syne with thy wappinnis wirtie him to deid.
Schir (said the Fox) e know my Roib is reid.
And thairfoir their will na beist abide me,
Thocht I wald be sa falls as for to hyde me.
is (quod the Uolf) throw buskis and throw baryes,
Law can thou lour, to cum to thy Intent.
Schir (said the Fox) e wait weill how it gais,
Ane lang space fra them they will feill my sent.
Than will they eschaip, suppois I should be schent.
And I am schamefull for to cum behind them,
In to the field thocht I should sleipand find them.
Na (quod the Uolf) thou can cum on the wind,
For every wrin^ forsooth thou hes ane wyle.
Schir (said the Fox) that beist e micht call blind,
That micht not eschaip than fra me ane mile.
How micht I ane of them that wyis begyl^?
My ti^pit two ei^is, and my two gray Ene
Gar^is me be ^end, quhair I was never seen.
Than (said the Uolf) Lowrence^ I heir the le,
And castis ^or petrellis thy ginnis to defend.
Bot all thy soneis sall not auaill the,
About the bulk with wayis thocht tho^ wend.
Falset will fail ay at the latter end.
To bow at bidding, and bide not quhill thou breast,
Thairfoir I gif the counsall for the best.
Schir (said the Fox) it is Lentring e se,
And I can nouther fische, with huke, nor Net,
To tak ane Banestikill, thocht we both should de.
I had ane other craft to win my meit.
Bot were it Pasche, that men should pultrie eit,
As Kiddis, Lambis, or Caponis in to ply.
To beir our office than wald I not set by.
Than (said the Uolf) in wraith wenis thou with wyl^s,
And with thy money mowis me to mat.
It is ane auld Dog doutles that thou begylis:
Thou wenis to draw the stra befoir the cat.
Schir (said the Fox) God wait, I mean not that,
For and I did, it were weill worth that e
In ane reid Raip had tyit me till ane tree.
Bot now I se, he is ane fule persay,
That with his master fallis in ressoning.
I did bot till assay quhat e wald say,
God wait my mind was on ane other thing.
I sall fulfill in all thing our bidding,
Quhat ever e charge on nichtis or on dayis.
Weill (quod the Uolf) I heir weill quhat thou sayis.
Bot it I will, thou make to me ane aith
For to be leill attour all leuand leid.
Schir (said the Fox) that ane word makes me wraith
For now I se, e haif me at ane dreid.
it sall I sweir, suppois it be not neid.
Be Iuppiter, and on pane of my heid,
I sall be true to ow, quhill I be deid.
With that ane Cadgear^ with capill, and with cr^^^lis,
Come ca^pand forth: than drew this Bouche our by.
The Fox the ^^ewer of the fresche hering feillis,
And to the Uolf he roundis priuelie.
Schir, one ar hering the Cadgear caryis by.
Thairfoir I reid, that we se for sum wayis,
To get sum fische aganis their fasting dayis.
Sen I am Stewart, I wald we had sum stuf,
And e ar silver seik, I wait richt weill.
Thocht we wald thig, one verray Churlische chuf,
He will not gif us ane hering of his Creill,
Befoir one Churl on kneis thocht we wald kneill.
Bot it I trow alsone that e sall se,
Gif I can traist, to bleir one Carllis Ee.
Schir, ane thing is, and we get of o^e pelf,
e man ^ak travel, and make us sum supple.
For he that will not laubour, and help him self,
In to their dayis he is not worth ane ^ie.
I think to wirk als besie as ane Be.
And e sall follow ane lytill e^terwart,
And gadder h^ring, for that sall be our part.
With that he kest ane cumpas far about,
And straucht him down in middis of the way,
As he war deid, he ^eneit him but dout.
And than upon ane lang vnliklie bray,
The quhyte o^ his Ene he ^urnit up in tway.
His tongue out hang ane handbreid of his heid.
And ^till he lay, als straucht as he were deid.
The Cadgear fand the Fox, and he was sane.
And till him self, thus softly can he say.
At the nixt bait in Faith e sall be slane,
And of our skyn I sall make mittennis two.
He lap full lichtlie abo^t him quhair he lay,
And all the trace he trippit on his ta is,
As he had hacd ane pyper play, he gais.
Heir lyis the Devil (quod ^e) deid in ane dyke.
Sic ane selcouth saw I not this seuin eir.
I trow e haif been tussillit with suin tyke,
That garris ow ly sa still withouttin steir.
Schir F^xe^ in Faith e ar deir welcum heir.
I^ is su^n wyfis malisone, I trow,
For pultrie pyking that lychtit hes on ow.
Their sall na Pedder, for purs, nor it for gluifis,
Nor it for poyntis pyke our p^llet fra me.
I sall of it make mittennis to my luifis,
Till hald my handis hait quhair ever I be.
Till F^anderis sall it never saill the se.
With that in hy, he hint h^n be the heillis,
And which ane swak he swang him on the creillis.
Syne be the heid the horse in hy hes hint.
The fraudfull Fox thairto g^lde tent hes taken.
And with his teith the stoppell or he stint,
Pullit out, and syne the hering ane, and ane
Out o^ the creillis he swakkit down good wane^
The Uolf was wa^^ and gadderit spedilie.
The Cadgear sang, huntis up, up upon hie.
it at ane burn the Cadgear lukit about.
With that the Fox ^ap q^yte the creillis fra.
The Cadgear wald haif raucht the Fox ane rou^.
Than with ane schou^, thus can the Cadgear say.
Bot all for nocht, he wan his hoill that day.
Abide, and thou ane Nekhering sall haif,
Is wor^h my Capill, Creillis, and all the laif.
Now (quod the Fox) I schrew me, and we meit.
I hard quhat thou hecht to do with my skyn.
Thy handis sall never in they mittennis tak heit,
And thou were hangit Carll, and all thy kyn.
Do forth thy market, at me thou sall nocht wyn,
And sell thy h^ring thou hes their, till hie price
Ellis thou sall wyn nocht on thy merchandice.
The Cadgear tr^millit for teyne quhair yat he stude.
I^ is weill worthy (quod he) I want one tyke,
That had nocht in my hand sa mekill good,
As staf, or sting, one truker for to stryke.
With that lychtlie he lap outouer ane dyke.
And snakkit down ane stat, for he was tene.
That heuie was, and of the Holyne grene.
With that the Fox unto the Uolf couth wend.
And fand him be the hering, quhair he lyis.
Schir (said he than) maid I not fair defend.
Ane wicht man wantit never, and he were wyis.
Ane hardy heart is hard for to suppryis.
(Than said the Uolf) thou art ane Ber^e full bald.
And wise at will, in good time be it tald.
Bot quhat was one the Carll cryit on hie,
And schuke his heid, quhen that he saw thou fell?
Schir (said the Fox) that I can tell trewlie.
He said, the Nekhering was in till the creill.
Kennis thou that hering: e Schir, I ken it weill.
And at the creill mouth I had it thryis but dout.
The wecht of it neir tit my tuskis out.
Now suithlie Schir, micht we that hering fa^g,
It wa^d befische to us their forty dayis.
Than (said the Uolf) now God nor that I hang,
Bot to be their, I wald gif all my clais.
To se gif that my wappinnis mycht it raise.
Schir (said the Fo^e) God wait, I wischit ow often,
Quhen that my pith micht not beir it on loft.
It is ane side of Salmond, as it were,
And callour, pyand like ane Pertrik Ee.
It is worth all the hering e haif their.
e and we had it swa, is it worth sic three.
Than (said the Uolf) quhat counsel geuis thou me?
Schir (said the Fox) wirk after my deuyis,
And e sall haif it, and tak ow na suppryis.
First, e man cast ane cumpas far about.
Syne straucht ow down in middis of the way.
Both heid, and fei^, and taill e man streik out.
Hing forth our tongue, and clois weill our Ene tway.
Syne se our heid on ane hard place e lay.
And dou^ not for na perrell may appeir,
Bot hald ow clois, quhe^ yat the Carll cummis neir.
And thocht e se ane staf, haif e na dout.
Bot hald ow wonder still in to that steid.
And luke our Ene be clois, as they were out.
And se that e schrink nouther fute, nor heid
Than will the Cadgear Carll trow e be deid,
And in till haist will hint ow be the heillis,
As he did me^, and swak ow on his creillis.
Now (quod the Uolf) I sweir the be my thrift,
I trow, one Cadgear Carll dow not me beir.
Schir (said the Fox) on loft he will ow lift,
Upon his creillis, and do him lytill deir.
Bot ane thing dar I suithlie to ow sweir,
Get e that hering sicker in sum place,
e sall not fair in f^sching mair quhill Pasche.
I sall say In principio upon ow,
And croce our corpse, from the top, to ta.
Wend quhen e will, I dar be warrant now,
That e sall de na suddand deith this day.
With that the Uolf gird up sone, and to ga,
And caist ane cumpas about the Cadgear ^ar.
Syne straucht him in the gait, or he come nair.
He laid his halfheid sicker, hard, and sad.
Syne straucht his four feit fra him, and his heid.
And hang his tongue forth as the Fox him bad.
Als still he lay, as he were ^erray deid.
Rakkand na thing of the Car^^is ^auour nor feid.
Bot ever upon the Nekhering he thinki^,
An^ quyte forettis the Fox, and all his wrinkis.
With that the Cadgear als wraith as any wind,
Come ty^and on the said, for it was lic^t.
Thinkand ay on the Fox that was be^ind,
Upon quhat wy^e, revenge him best he micht.
And at the last, of the Uolf gat ane sicht,
Quhai^ he in lenth lay streiki^ in the gai^.
Bot gif he ^icht^^ down, or nocht, God wai^.
Softly he said. I was begylit anis,
Be I begylit twyis, I schrew us both.
That evil bot it sall licht upon thy banis,
He should haif had, that hes done me the s^aith.
On hicht he ho^it the staf for he was wraich,
And hit him with sic will upon the heid,
Quhill neir he swonit, and swelt in to that steid.
Three battis he bure, or he his feit mycht find.
Bot it the Uolf was wicht, and wan away.
He micht not se, he was sa verray blind.
Nor wit reddilie quhether it was nicht or day.
The Fox beheld that service quhair he lay,
And leuch on loft, quhen he the Uolf sa seis,
Both deif, and dosinnit, fall swonand on his knei^.
He that of ressoun can not be content,
Bot couetis all, is abill all to tyne.
The Fox, quhen that he saw the Uolf was schent,
Said to him seif, their hering sall be mine.
I le, or ellis he was efterwart syne,
That ^and sic wayis his Master for to grief,
With all the fische thus Lowrence tuke his leif.
The Uolf was neir weill dungin to the deid,
That vneis with his life away he wan.
For with the Bastoun weill brokin was his heid.
The Fox in to his den sone drew him than,
That had betrai it hi^ Master, and the man.
The ane, wantit the hering of his creillis.
The vtheris blude was rynnand over ^is heillis^
MORALITAS.
THis Taill is myngit with Morality.
As I sall schaw sum^uhat, or that I ceis.
The Fox, unto the world may likkinnit be.
The reuand Uolf, unto ane man but leis.
The Cadgear Deith, quhome under all man preis,
That ever tuke life, throw course of kind man dee.
As man, and beist, and fische in to the sea.
The world e wait, is Stewart to the man.
Quhilk may make man to haif na mind of Deid.
Bot settis for winning all the craftis they can.
The Hering, I likkin unto the gold sa reid,
Quhilk gart the Uolf in perrell put his heid.
Richt swa the gold garris Land c^rteis,
With weir, be waisti^ daily as men seis.
And as the Fox with dissimulance and gyle,
Gart the Uolf wene to haif worschip for ever.
Richt swa, this world with vane glore for ane quhyle
Flatteris with folk, as they should fail never.

FINIS.
The Taill of the Fox, that begylit the Uolf, in the schadow of the Moon.
IN Elderis dayis, as Esope can declair,
Their was ane Husband, qubilk had ane pleuch to steir.
His use was ay, in morning to rise air.
Sa happinnit him in streiking time of eir,
Airlie in the morning to follow forth his feir,
Unto the pleuch, bot his gadman and he.
His flottis he straucht with Benedicite.
The Caller cryit, how, haik, upon hicht,
Hald draucht my dowis, syne broddit them full sair.
The Oxin was vnwsit oung and licht,
And for fersnes they couth the fur forfair.
The Husband than woxe angry as ane hair.
Syne cryit, and caist his Patill, and greit s^anis.
The Uolf (quod he) mot haif ow all at atanis.
Bot it the Uolf was neirar nor he wend,
For in ane busk he lay, and Lowrence both,
In ane Rouch Rone was at the furris end.
And hard the hecht: than Lowrence le^ch full raith.
To tak one bud (quod he) it were na skaith.
Weill (quod the Uolf) I hecht the be my hand,
one Carllis word as he were King ^all stand.
The Oxin eirit mair reullie at the last.
Syne after they lousit, ^ra that it worthit weill lait.
The Husband hamewart with his cattle past.
Than sone the Uolf come hirpilland in his gait,
Befoir the Oxin, and schupe to make de^air.
The Husband saw him, and worthit sumdeill aghast.
And bakwart with his beistis wald haif past.
The Uolf said, quhether dryuis thou this Pray?
I challenge it, for nane of them ar thine.
The man thairof was in ane felloun fray.
And soberlie to the ^olf answerit syne.
Schir, be my Saull, their oxin ar all mine.
Thairfoir I study, quhy e should stop me.
Sen that I faltit never to ow trewlie.
The Uolf said, Carll, gaif thou not me this drift
Airlie, quhen thou was eirand on one bank?
And is their oucht (sayis thou) frear than gift?
This tarying will tyne the all thy thank.
Far better is frelie for to gif ane plank,
Nor be compellit on force, to gif ane mark.
Fie on the fredome, that cummis not with heart.
Schir (quod the husband) ane man may say in grief,
And syne ganesay fra he auise and se.
I hecht to ste^^l, am I thairfoir ane theif?
God fo^bid, Schir, all hechtis should haldin ve.
Gaif I my hand or oblissing (quod he)
Or haif e witness, or writ for to schaw.
Schir reif me not, bot go and seik the Law.
Carll (quod the Uolf) ane Lord and he be leill,
That schrinkis for schame, or doutis to be reprufit,
His saw is ay als sickker as his Seill.
Fie on the Leid, that is not leill and lufit.
Thy argument is false, and eik contrusit.
For it is said in Proverb: But lawte
All other vertew is ar nocht worth ane fle.
Schir, said the husband, remember of this thing.
Ane ^eill man is not tan^ at half ane taill.
I may say, and ganesay, I am na King.
Quha^ is our witness, yat hard I hecht them haill^
Than said the Uolf, thairfoir it sall nocht faill.
Lowrence (quod he) cum hidder of that Schaw,
And say na thing, bot as thou hard and saw.
Lowrence come lourand, for he lufit never licht,
And sone appe^rit be^oir them in that place.
The man le^ch na thing, quhen he saw that sicht.
Lowre^ce (quod the Uolf) thou man declair yis case,
Quhairof we sall schaw the suith in schort space.
I callit on the leill witness for to beir.
Quhat hard thou that this man hecht me lang eir?
Schir (said the Tod) I can not hastily
Swa sone as now gif sentence final.
Bot wald e both submit ow heir to me,
To stand at my decreit perpetual.
To pleis both I should preif, gif it may fall.
Weill (quod the Uolf) I am content for me.
The man said, swa am I, how ever it be.
Than sch^w they ^urth their allegiance but fabill,
And both prop^^it their pley to him compleit.
(Quod Lowrence) now I am ane Judge amycabill.
e sall be sworn to stand at my decreit.
Quh^^her beit after e think it sour or sweit.
The Uolf braid forth his fute, the man his hand:
And on the Toddis Taill sworn they ar to stand.
Their t^ke the Tod the man forth till ane side.
And said him, ^rein^^ thou art in blunder brocht.
The (...) will not forg^^ the ane O^e hyde.
it wald my sel^^^ne hel^ the, and I mocht.
Bot I am la^th to hur^ my conscience oth^.

This will not throw but greit coist and ^xpenc^.
Seis thou not Buddis beiris Bernis throw:
And giftis gar^is crukit ma^eris hald full euin?
Sumtymis ane nedill haldis ane man in ane Kow.
^ll are not halie, that heifis their handis to heui^.
Schir (said the man) e sall haif sex, or seuin
Richt of the f^ttest hennis of all the ^^oik.
I count not all the laif, leif me the Coik.
I am ane Judge (quod Lowrence than) and leuch.
Their is na Buddis should beir me by the rycht.
I may tak hennis^ and Caponis weill aneuch,
For God is gane to sleip, as for this nycht.
Sic small thingis a^ not seen in to his sycht.
Their hennis (quod he) sall make thy qu^rrell sur^
With empty hand na man should Ha^^is lure.
Concord in this than Lowrence tuke his leif,
And to the Uolf he went in to ane ling.
Syne priu^lie, he plukkit him be the s^ei^,
Is this in ernist (quod he) e ask sic thing?
(...) b^ my Saull, I trow it be in he^hing.
Than said the Uolf, Lowrence, quhy sayis thou s^?
Thou h^rd the hech^ thy sell, th^^ ^e couth m^.
The hecht (quod he) on^ man maid at the pleuch,
Is that the cause quhy e the ca^tell crai^?
Half in to heithing (said Lowrence th^n) and le^ch.
Schir, be the Rude, v^ro^kkit now ^ raif^
The Devil ane (...)
Wald I tak it vp^n my conscience,
To do (...) pure ane man^ as ^^ne o^fen^e^

We are concordit upon this (...).
Quyte of all clamis ^w^ e will make him fre,

That sic ane sall not be in all this land.
For it is Somer Cheis, both ^resche and fair.
He sayis it weyis ane s^ane, and sumdeill mair.
Is that thy counsel (quod the Uolf) I do,
That one Carll for ane Cabok ^uld be fre?
e ve my Saull, and I were sworn ow to,
e should nane other counsel ha^f for me.
For gang e to the may ex^^^^^tie,
It will not wyn ow worth ^ne widderit neip.
Schir trow e nocht, I ha^t ane Saull to keip^
Weill (quod the Uolf) it is aganis my will,
That one Carll for ane Cabok should ga quyte.
Schir (q^od the Tod) ^ ^^k (...) in nane evil.
For be my Saull ou^ self had all the wit.
Than (said the Uolf) I bid na mair to flyte.
Bo^ I wald se one Cabok of sic pryis.
Sch^^ (said the ^^d) he tauld me quhar it lyi^.
Than hand in hand, they held unto ane hill.

Lowrence was ever remembering upon (...),
and subteltei^ the Uolf for to ^egyle.
That he had hecht ane Caboik, he forthin^^^,

Than at him self softly couth he smyle.
The Uolf sayis, Lowrence, thou playis belly blind^
We seik all nycht, bot na thing can we find.
Schir (said the Tod) we are at it almaist^
Soft ow ane lytill, and e sall se it sone.
Than to ane Manure place they hy^t in hai^t.
The nicht was lycht, and pennyfull the Moon.
Than til ane draw well their Seneoures past but hone^
Quhar that two (...) is several suithlie hang.
As ane come up, ane other down wald gang.
The schadow of the Moon schon^ in the well.

Now se e not the Caboik weill our sell,
Quhy^e, as ane Nei^, and als round as ane schell.
He hang it o^der, that na man ^ind it st^ill.
Schir, trai^t ^ weill^ one Caboik e se ^ing,

Na (quod the Uolf) mycht I one Caboik ha^f,

The Tod come hailland up, the Uolf eid down.
Than angerlie the Uolf upon him cryis.

Schir (quod the Tod) thus fai^is it of Fortoun,
As ane cummis up, scho quheillis ane other down.
Than to the ground sone eid the Uolf in haist.
The Tod lap on land, als blyith as any bell.
And left the Uolf in watter to the waist.
Quha haillit him out I wait not of the well.

MORALITAS.
THis Uolf, I likkin to ane wickit man,
Quhilk do^s the pure oppres in every place:
And pykis at them all querrellis that he can,
Be Rigor, reif, and other wickitnes.
The Fox, the Feynd I call in to this ca^^,
Arctand ilk man to ryn vnrychteous rinkis,
Thinkand thairthrow to lok him in his linkis.
The Husband may be callit ane godly man,
With quhome the Feynd salt findis (as Clerkis reides)
Besie to tempt him, with all wayis that he can.
The hennis, ar warkis, yat fra serme faith proceidis.
Quhar sir sproutis spreidis, y^ evil spreit yair not speides
Bot wendis unto the wickit man agane^
That he hes tint his travel is full vnfane.
The woddes waist, quhairin was the Uolf wyld
At wickit riches, quhilk all men ga^p^s to get:
Quha traistis in sic Trusterie, ar often begyld.
For Mammon may be callit the Deuillis Net,
Quhilk Sathanas for all sinful hes set.
With proud plesour quha settis his traist thairin,
But special grace lychtlie can not outwin.
The Cabok, may b^ callit Couetyce,
Quhilk blomis braid in money mannis E^.
Ua worth the well of that wickit vice,
For it is all bot fraud, and fa^tasie.
Dryuand ilk man to leip in the buttrie,
That dounwart drawis unto the pane of hell
Christ keip all Christianis from that wickit well.
FINI^.
The Taill of the Uolf, and the Uedder.
QUhylum their was (as Esope can Report)
Ane sch^iphird dwelland be ane Forest neir.
Quhilk had ane Hou^d, yat did him greit co^^or^
Full war he was to wa^k his Fauld but weir,
That nouther. Uolf, nor Uildcat durst appeir,
Nor Fox on feild^ ^^r it no other beist,
Bot he them flew, or chai^sit at the leist.
S^ happinni^ i^ (as euerilk heist man d^)

Bot tha^ (God wait) the keipar of the fe,
For v^r^ay woe woxe (...) nor the we^^.

To saif the selie beistis that I keip,
For wit the Uolf, werryit beis all my scheip.
It wald haif maid ane mannis heart fair to s^
The selie ^cheiphirdis lamentatioun.
Now is my Darling deid, allace (quod he)
For now to beg my breid I may be boun,
With pyikstaf, and with scrip to fair of town.
For all the beistis befoir ^andonit been,
Will sch^te upon my beistis with Ire and tene.
With that ane Uedder wrerhitlie wan on ^ute:
Master (quod he) make merry, and be blyith.
To brek our heart for baill, it is na bute.
For ane deid Doig e na ^ait on ow kyith.
Ga ^ethe him hithor, and fla his skyn of swyith.
Syne sew it on me: and luke that it be meit,
Both heid, and c^ag, body, taill, and feit.
Than will the Uol^ trow, that I am he.
For I sall follow him fa^t qu^ar ^uer he fair.
All haill the cure I tak it upon me.
our scheip to keip at midday, lait, and air.
And he persew, he God, I sall not spair
To follow him als fast as did our Doig.
Swa that I warrant, e fall not want ane hoig.
Tha^ said the scheiphird, this come of ane good wit.
Thy counsall is both s^kk^r leill, and true.
Quha sayis ane scheipis dair, they heir of it.
With that in hy the Doggis skyn o^ he flew,
And on the scheip rycht so^tlie cou^h it sew.
Th^n worth the Uedder wantoun of his weid.
Now of the Uolf (quod he) I haif na dreid.
In all thingis he counterfeit the Dog,
For all the nicht he stude, and tuk^ na sleip.
Swa that weill lang their wantit not ane Hog,
Swa war he was, and walkryfe them to keip,
That Lowrence durst not luke upon ane scheip.
For and he did, he followit him sa fast,
That of his life he maid him all aghast.
Was nouther Uolf, Uildcat, nor it Tod,
Durst cum within they boundis all about:
Bot he wald chase them both throw ^ouch and snod.
They h^i^full beistis had of their lyuis si^ dout.
For he was mekill, and semit to be stou^.
That euerilk beist they dred him as the deid,
Within that woid that nan^ durst hald their he^d.
it happinnit their ane hungry Uolf to slide
Out throw his scheip, quhair they lay on ane le^
I sall haif^^e (quod he) quhat ever betyde,
Thocht I he werryit, ^o^ hunger or I de.
With that ane Lamb in till his cluke hint he.
The laif start up, for they were all aghast.
Bot (God wait) gi^ the Uedder followit ^ast.
Went never Hound mair haistelie fra the hand,
Quhen he was rynnand may raklie at the Ra,
Nor went this Uedder both over Mois and strand,
And stoppit no^^her at bank, bu(...).
Bot followit ay sa ^e^^lie on his (...),
With sic ane drift, ^nhill dust and dirt ouerdra^^ him.
And maid ane wow to God, that he should haif him.
With that the Uol^ let out his Taill on lenth,
For he was hungry, and it drew neir the euin.
And schupe him for to ryn with all his strenth,
Fra he the Uedder sa neir cummand had seen,
He dred his life, and he ouertane had been.
Thairfoir he spairit nouther busk, nor boig.
For weill he kennit the cumming of the Doig.
To make him lycht, he kest the Lamb him fra.
Syne lap over leis, and draif throw dub and myr^.
Na (quod the wedder) in Faith we part not swa.
It is not the Lamb, bot the, that I desire.
I sall cum neir, for now I se the tire.
The Uolf ran till ane rekill stude behind him,
Bot ay the neirar the Uedder to couth wyn him.
Sone after that, he followit him sa neir,
Quhill that the Uolf for ^leidnes fylit the field.
Syne left the gait, and ran throw busk, and breir,
And schupe him fra the schawis for to scheild.
He ran restles, for he wist of na weild.
The wedder follo^^t him, both out, and in,
Quhill that ane breir busk raif rudely of the skyn.
The Uolf was were, and blenkit him behind,
And saw the Uedder come thra wa^d throw the breir.
Syne saw the Doggis skyn hinga^d on his lind.
Na (quod he) is this e, that is sa neir?
Richt now ane Hou^d, and now quhyte as ane Freir.

To God I wow, that e sall ^ew this raise.
Quhat was the cause e gaif me sic ane chase?
With that in hy he hint him be the horn.
For all our mowis, e met anis with our mache,
Suppois e leuch me all this eir to scorn.
For quhat enchessoun this Doggis skyn haif e borne?
Master (quod he) bot to haif playit with ow,

Is this our bourding in ernist than (quod he)
For I am verray effeirit, and on flocht.
Cum bak agane, and I sall let ow se.
Than quhar the gait was grimmit he him brocht.
Quhether call e this fair play, or nocht?
To set our Master in sa fell effray,
Quhill he for feiritnes hes fylit up the way.
Thryis (be my Saull) e gart me schute behind,
Upon my hoichis the seneis may be seen.
For feiritnes full often I fylit the wind.
Now is this e: na bot ane Hound, I wene.

In play or ernist, preif quha sa ever will.

FINIS.
The Taill of the Uolf, and the Lamb.
ANe cruel Uolf, richt ravenous, and fell,
Upon ane time past to ane Reuer.
Descending from ane Roche, unto ane well.
To slaik his thrist, drank of the watter cleir.
Swa upon case, ane selie Lamb come neir.
Bot of his fa, the Uolf, na thing he wist.
And in the streme laipit, to rule his thrist.
Thus drank they both, bot not of ane Intent.
The Uolfis thocht was all of wickitnes.
The selie Lamb, was meik, and Innocent,
Upon the Reuer, in ane other place,
Beneth the Uolf, he drank ane lytill space,
Quhill he thocht good, beleuand their nane evil.
The Uolf him saw, and Rampand come him till.
With girnand teith, and awful angry luk,
Said to the Lamb, thou Ca^^ue wretchir thing.
How durst thou be sa bald, to fyle this Bruk,
Quhar I should drink, with thy foull flauering?
It were Almous the for to draw and hing,
That should presume, with thy foull lippis wyle,
To glar my drink, and this fair wa^ter fyle.
The selie Lamb quaikand for verray dreid,
On kneis fell, and said, Schir, with our leif.
Suppois I ^ar not say, their of e l^id:
Bot ^e my Sauil, I wa^r e ^a^ noche preif,
That I did any thing, that should ow grief.
e wait alswa that our accusatioun,
Faileis fra treuth, and contrair is to ressoun.
Thocht I can nocht, Nature will ^e defend,
And of the deid perfyte experience.
All heuie thing, man of the self descend.
Bot gif sum thing on force make resistance.
Than may the streme on na way make ascence,
Nor ryn bakwart: I drank beneth ow far.
Ergo, for me, our Bruke was never the war.
Alswa, my lippis sen that I was ane Lamb,
Tuichit na thing that was contagious.
Bot soukkit milk, from Pappis of my dame,
Richt Natural, sweit, and als delitious.
Weill (quod the Uolf) thy language Rigorous
Cummis the of kind: swa thy Father before
Held me at bait, both with boist, and schore.
He wraithit me, and than I culd him warn,
Within ane eir, and I brukit my heid,
I should be wrokkin on him, or on his barn,
For his exhorbitant and frawart pleid.
Thou ^all doutles for his deidis be deid.
Schir, it is wrang, that for the Father is gilt,
The s^ikles sone should punist be, or spilt.
Haif e not hard, quhat halie Scripture sayis,
Endytit with the mouth of God Almycht?
Of his awin d^idis ^lk man sall beir the prais,
As pane for sin, reu^ard for werkis rycht.
For my trespass, quhy should my sone haif plycht?
Quha did the mis, let him sust^ne the pane.
aa (quod the Uolf) it pleyis thou agane.
I let the wit, quhen that the Father o^^endi^,
I will chereis nane of his Successioun.
And of his barnis, I may weill tak amendis,
Unto the twenty degree descending down.
Thy Father thocht to make ane strange preso^a,
And with his mouth in to my watter spew.
Schir (quod the Lamb) they two ar nouther true.
The Law sayis, and e will understand:
Their should na man for wrang^ nor violence,
His awin sair punis at his awin hand,
Without process of Law, and evidence.
Quhilk should haif leif to make lawful defense,
And thairupon Summondis Peremptourlie,
For to propo^e, contrairie, or reply.
Set me ane lauchfull Court, I sall compeir,
Befoir the Lyoun, Lord, and leill Justice.
And be my hand I oblis me rycht heir,
That I sall bide ^ne vnsuspect Assyis.
This is the Law: this is the Instant use:
e should pretend thairfoir ane Summondis make,
Aganis that day, to gif ressoun, and tak.
Na (quod the Uol^) thou wald Intruse ressoun,
Quhar wrang, and reif should dwell in property.
That is ane point, and part of falls tressoun,
For to gar reuth rem^^e with crueltie^
Be his woundis, falls tratour, thou sall de,
For thy trespass, and for thy Fatheris als.
With that anon he hint him be the hals.
The selie Lamb culd do na thing bot blai^.
Sone was he deid: the Uolf wald do na grace.
Syne drank his blude, and of his ^lesche can eit,
Quhill he was full, and went his way on pace.
Of his murder quhat sall we say, allace?
Was not this reuth, was not this greit piety?
To gar this selie Lamb but gilt thus de.
MORALITAS.
THe pure pepill, this Lamb may signify,
As Maill men, Merchandis, and all lauboureris.
Of quhome the life, is half ane Purgatory,
To win with lautie leuing as effe^ris.
The Uolf bet^kinnis falls extortioneris,
And oppressouris of pure men, as we se,
Be violence, or craft in faculty.
Three kind of Uolfis, in this world now Ringes.
The first, ar falls peruerteris of the Lawis.
Quhilk under Poet termis, falset mingis,
Lettand that all^wer Gospel, that he schawis.
Bot for ane bud the pure man he ouerthrawis,
Smoirand the richt, garrand the wrang proceid.
Of sic Uolfis hellis fire sall be their meid.
O man of Law, let be that subteltie,
W^^^ nyce gimpis, and fraudis Intricate:
And think tha^ God in his Divinity,
The wrang, the rycht, of all thy werkis wait.
For prayer, price, for hie, nor law estait,
Of falls querrellis se thou make na defense.
Hald with the tycht, hurt not thy conscience.
Ane other kind of Uolfis Ravenous,
Ar mychtie men, haifand aneuch plenty.
Quhilkis ar sa gredie, and sa covetous,
They will not thoill the pure in piece to b^^
Suppois he, and his houshald both should de,
For falt of fude, thairof they gif na rak,
Bot over his heid his mailling will they tak.
O man but mercy, quhat is in thy thocht?
War than ane Uolf, and thou culd understand,
Thou hes aneuch, the pure husband richt nocht,
Bot croip, and calf, upon ane clout of land.
For Goddis aw, how durst thou tak on hand,
And thou in Barn, and B^^e sa been, and big,
To put him fra his tak, and gat him thig?
The third Uolf, ar men of heritage:

FINIS.
The Taill of the Paddok, and the Mous.
UPon ane time (as Esope culd Report)
An^ lytill Mous come till ane Reuer side.
Scho micht not waid, her scha^kis were sa schort
Scho culd not swym, scho had na horse to ride.
Of verray force behouit her to ^yde.
And to, and fra, beside that Reuer deip,
Scho ran, ^^yand, with money pi^tuous p^ip.
Help over, help over, this silly Mons can cry,
For Goddis lufe, sum body over the brym.
With that ane Paddok in the watter by,
Put up her heid, and on the bank can clym.
Quhilk ^e nature culd dowk, and gaylie swym.
With voce full rauk, scho said on this maneir.
Good morn (schir Mous) quhat is our erand heir?
Seis thou (quod scho) of corn ^ne Iolie flat
Of ryip Aittis, of Barlie, Peis, and Quheit.
I am hungry, and fane wald be thairat.
Bot I am ^^oppit be this watter deip.
And on this side, I get na thing till eit,
Bot hard Nuttis, quhilkis with my teith I bore.
Were I beond, my Feist were fer the more.
I haif na boit, heir is na Marineris:
How can thou fleit without fedder or syn?
This Reuer is sa deip, and dangerous,
Me think, that thou fuld drownit be thairin.
Tell me thairfoir, quhat faculty or gyn,
Thou hes to bring the over this watter? Than
Thus to declair the Paddok sone began.
With my two feit (quod scho) lukkin and braid,
In steid of Air, I row the streme ^ull still.
And thocht the brym be perrillous to waid^
Both to, and fra, I row at my awin will.
I may not droun, for quhy my oppin Gill
Deuoidis ^y the watter I resaif.
Thai^foir to droun for^^ith na dreid I haif.
The Mous ^eheld unto her fro^^^ (...)^
Her runk^^^ cheikis, and her lippis side:
Her hingand browis, and ^ir (...)
^ir logg^^and leggis, and her harsky hyde.
Scho ran abak, and on the Paddok cryde.
Gif I can any skill of Phisnomie,
Thou hes s^mpar^ of false^, and Inuie.
For Cler^is sayis, the Inclinatioun
Of mannis thocht, proceidis commounlie,
After the Corporal complexioun,
To gud^, or evil, as Nature will apply.
Ane thrawett vult, ane thrawert Phisnomy.
The auld Proverb is witness of this Lorum:
Distortum vult^m sequitur distortio morum.
Na (quod the Ca^d) that Proverb is not trew^
For fair thingis oftymis ar fundin faikyn.
The Bla verryis thocht they be sad of hew,
Ar gadderit up, quhen Primeros is forsakin.
The face may faill, to be the hartis takin.
Thairfoir I find this Scripture in all plac^^
Thou should not Judge ane man after his fac^^
Thocht I vnha^^^um be to luke upon,
I haif na cause, quhy I should lakkit be.
Were I als fai^, as Iolie Absolon,
I am n^ c^use^ of that greit beutie.

And be quha^ craft thou gar me vnd^rstand.
That thou wald gyde me to one onder land^
Thou wait (quod scho) ane body that hes ne^^,
To help them self, should money wayis cast.
Thairfoir ga tak ane dowbill tuynit threid,
And bind thy leg to mine with knottis fast^
I sall the leir to swym, be not aghast,
Als weill as I. As thou (than quod the Mous)
To prei^ that play^ it were rycht perrillous.
Should I be bund, and fast, quhar I am fre,
In hoip of help, na than I schrew us both.
For I mycht lois both life and libertie^
Gif it were ^wa, quha should amend the skaith?
Bot gif thou sweir to me the murthour ^ith,
But fra^d, or gyle, to bring me over this ^^ude,
But hurt, or harm. In Faith (quod scho) I dude.
Scho go (...) up, and to the ^enin can cry:
O Iuppi^e^, of Nature God and King.
I make ane aith tr^wlie to the, that I
This lytill Mous sall over this watter wing.
This aith was maid. The Mous but per^a^in^
The false Ingyne of this foull trappal^ Taid^
Tuke threid, and ^^nd her leg, as scho ^i^ had.
Than fute, for ^u^e, they lap^ (...)

And thocht, the (...)
Persauand this, the Mous on her ^an cry,
Tratour to God, and manesworne unto me.
Thou swore the murthour aith richt now, that I
But hurt, or harm, should ferryit be and fre.
And quhen scho saw their was bot do, or de,
With all her mycht scho forcit her to swym:
And preissit upon the Taiddis bak to clym.
The dreid of deith her strenthis gart Incres,
And forcit her defend, with mycht, and mane.
The Mous vpwart: the Paddok down can preis:
Quhyle to, quhyle ^ra, quhyle dowkit up agane.
This silli^ Mous plungit in to greit pane,
Began fecht als lang as breith was in her breis^^
Till at the last, scho cryit for ane Priest.
Fechtand thusgait the Gled sat on ane twist,
And to this wretchi^ battle tuke good heid.
And with ane wisk, or any of them wist,
He claucht his cluke betuix them in the threid.
Syne to the land he ^lew with them good speid,
Fane of that fang, pyipand with money pew:
Syne lowsit them, and both but piety flew.
Syne b^wellit yame, yat Boucheour with his ^ill
And belliflau^ht full fettillie them flaid.
Bot all their flesche wald scant be half ane fill,
And guttis als unto that gredie glaid^
Of their debait, thus quhen I hard outraid,
He tuke his ^^icht, and over the feildis flaw.
Gif this ^e ^rew, s^eir e at them that saw.
MORALITAS.
MY Brother, gif thou will tak aduertence,
Be this ^abill thou may per^a^e and se.
It passis fer all kind of Pestilence,
Ane wickit mind, with wordis fair and fle.
Be war thairfoir, with quhome thou fa^lowi^ the.
To the were better beir the stane barrow,
For all thy ^ayis to delf quhill thou may dre,
Than to be machit with ane wickit marrow.
Ane falls Intent under ane fair presence,
Hes causit money Innocent for to de.
Greit fol^e is to gif over sone credence,
To all that speikis fairlie unto the.
Ane sil^in tongue, ane heart of ^rueltie,
Smytis more sore, than any schot of arrow.
Brothe^ gif thou be wise, I reid the fle,
Than mache the with ane thrawart fen^eit marrow.
I w^rne the als, it is greit negligence,
To bind the fast, quhar thou was frank and fre.
Fra thou be b^nd, thou may make na defense,
To sai^ thy life, nor it thy liberty.
This si^^pill counsall, brother, tak of me,
And it to cu^ p^^queir, se thou not tarrow.
Better but st^y^e to leif allane in le,
Than to be machit with ane wickit marrow.
This hald in mind, rycht more I sall the tell,
Quhar by thi^ beistis may be figurate.
The Paddok vsand in the flude to dwell,

Of Carnal lust be the Suggestioun:
Quhilk drawis ay the Saull, and druggis down.
The Gled is Deith, that cummis suddandlie,
As dois ane theif, and cu^tis sone the battall.
Be vigilant thairfoir, and ay reddie,
For mannis life is br^kill, and ay mortal.
My friend thairfoir, make the ane strange Castle
Of Faith in Christ: for deith will the assay:
Thou wait not quhen, euin, morrow, or midday.
Adieu my friend: and gif that any speiris,
Of this fabill, sa schortlie I conclude.
Say thou, I left the laif unto the Freiris,
To make exempill, and ane similitude.
Now Christ for us that deit on the Rude,
Of Saull, and life, as thou art Saluiour:
Grant us till pas, in till ane blissit hour.
