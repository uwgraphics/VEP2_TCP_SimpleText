The Book of the fair Genty^woman, that no man should put his trust, or
confydence in: that is to say, Lady Fortune: flaterynge every man that
coueyteth to have all, and specially, them that trust in her, she deceyueth
them at last.

The Lady Fortune.


The Prologue.
IS often as I co^sydre, these old noble cle^k^^
Poetis, Orators, and Phylosopher^ sects thre^
How wonderful they were, in all their works
How eloquent, how inuentyue in every degree
Half amassed I am, and as a d^ed tree
Stand still, over ^ude for to bring forth
Any fruit or sentence, that is ought worth^
^euertheles though rude I be, in all co^trynyng
Of matts, yet so^what to make, I need not to care
I se many a one occupied, in the same thing
^o unlearned men now a days, will not spare
To write, to babble, their minds to declare
Trowynge them self, gay fantasyes to draw
when all their cunning is not worth a straw.
Some i^ french Chronicles, gladly does presu^^
Some in English, blyndly wade and wander
Another in laten blows forth a dark ^^me
As wise as a great hedded Ass of Al^^andr^
Some in Phylosophye, like a gage^yng^ gand^
Begynn^th lustely the brows to set up
And at the last concludes, in the good ale cup^

FO^tune peruersse

FOrtune, O mighty and varyable
what rule thou ^laym^st, with thy ^ruel po^er
Good folk^ thou stroyest, and love re^r^uable
^hou may not waraunt thy gyf^es for on^ hour
Fortun^ unworthy men settet^ in ho^oure
Through fortune t^i^nocent i^ woe and so^ow sh^i^heth
The just man she sp^y^^th, and the vn^ust enrycheth.
Young men she kylleth, and let^eth old men live
V^ryghtuously deuydynge, time and season
That good ^en leseth, to wyck^d does she give
She has no difference, ^ut judges all good reason
Inconstaunce, slypper, ^rayle, ^n^ full of treason
Neither for ever cherys^^ynge, (...) keth
Nor for ever oppressynge, whom s^e fors^keth.

The words of Fortune to the people. quod. Tho. Mo.
Mine high estate, power and auctoryte
If ye ne knew, enserche an^ ye shall spy
That richesse, worship, wealth, and dygnyte
Joy, rest, and peace, and all thing finally
That any pleasure or profit may come by
To man's comfort, aid and sustenannce
(...) all at my deuyse, and ordinance.
Without my favor, there is no thing won
^any a matter have I brought at last
To good conclusyon, that fondly was begone
And many a purpose, bounden sure and fast
^^th wise ^rouysyon, I have ouercaste
^^thout good h^ppe, there may no wit suffyse
Better is to be fortunate, than wise.
And therefore has there some men ben or thi^
^y deedly fooes, and wr^ten many a book
^o my disprayse, and no other cause th^re i^
^ut for me ly^t, not friendly on them look
^hus like the fox they fare, that ones forsook
^he pleasant grapes, and began for to desy^ them
^ycause he ^ept and ^ept, and could not come by the^,
But let them write, their labo^^ is in vain
For well ye wot, mirth, honor and ^ychesse
Better is than shame, penury and pain
The nedy writes, that lyngeryth in dystresse
without mine help, is ever comfortless
A wity b^rden odyouse and loathe
To all the world^, and to hyms^lfe both.
But he that by my favor may ascen^^
To mighty power, and excellent degree
A common well to govern, and defend
O in how blessed condycyon, stands he
Him self in honor and felycyte
And o^^r that, may forther and encreace
An hol^ regyon, in ioye^est and p^ace.
Now^ in this point, t^ere is no more to say
Each man has o^ him self the governance
Let eue^y wight, than ^a^e his ow^ way
And he that out of pouert^, and mys^haunce
Lift for to l^ue^ and will him self enhaunce
In wealth and richesse, come ^orth and wait on me
And he that will be a beggar, let him be.
To them that trusts in Fortune.
THou that art proud of honor shape or kyn
That helpest up this wretched worlds tresure
Thy fyngers shryned with gold / thy tawny skyn
With fresshe appareyll, garnyshed out of mesure
And weny^t to have fortune, always at thy pleasure
Cast up thine eye, and l^^^ how slypper chance
Illudeth her men with change and varyaunce.
Sometime she looks, as lovely fair and bright
As goodly Venus, mother of cupyde
She becketh and smyleth upon every wight
^ut this feyned chere, may not abide
There comes a cloud, and farewell all our pride
Like any serpent, she begins to swell
And looks as fearse, as any fury of hell.
Yet for all that, we brothle men are feign
So wretched is our nature, and so blind
As soon as fortune list, to laughe again
With fair countenance, and deceytfull mind
To croutche and knele, and gape after the wind
Not one or twain, but thousands in a rout
Like swarmyng bees, come flakerynge her about.
Then as bayte, she brings forth her ware
Silver, gold, rich perle, and precious stone
On which, the mased people gase and stare
And g^pe therfore^ as ^o^ges for the bone
Fortune at them l^ugheth, and in her trone
Amyd her tresure^ and wauerynge ry^hesse
Prowdly she loves, as Lady and Empresse^
Fast by her side does weary labor stand
Pale fere also and sorrow all be wept
Dysdeyne^ and hatred, on that other hand
Eke r^stle^ watch, f^o sleep with travail kep^
His eyes drowsy, and lokynge as he slepte
Before her stands Danger and ^nuye
Flatery, Dysceyte, Myschyfe, and Tyrrannye^
About her comes, all the world to beg
He as^eth lond^^and he to pass would b^ynge
T^i^ joy and that, and all not worth an egg
He would in love prosp^re, above all thing
He kneleth down and would be made a king
He forces not^ so he may money have
Though all y^ world account him for a kna^^
Lo t^us diverse heddy^, diverse wits
Fortune alone, a^ dyue^^ (...) they all
Unstable here and there, amon^e them flyttes
And at adventure, down her gifts fall
Catch who so may, she throw^th great and sin^^
Not to all m^n, as ^o^meth son or dew
But for the most p^rte, all among^ a few.
And yet her brotell gifts, may not last
He that she gave them, looks proud and hye
She whyrleth about, and plucketh away as fast
And gives them to an other, by and by
And thus from man to man, contynually
She uses to give and take, and s^y^y toss
One man to winning, and of an others loss.
And when she robs one, down goth his pride
He wepeth and wayleth, and curses her full sore
But he that receives it, on that other side
Is glad, and blesses her, a.M, times therefore
But in a while when she loves him no more
She glydeth from him, and her gifts to
And he her curses, as other fools do^
Alas the folysshe people, can not seace
Ne void her train, till they the harm f^^^
About her always, besely they preace
But lord what he thinks him self, we^e
That may set ones, his hand upon her whele
He holds fast, but upward as he styeth
She whyppeth her where about, and there he lies.
Thus fell Julius, from his mighty power
Thus fell Darius, the worthy king of perse
Thus fell Alexandre, the sovereign conqueroure
Thus many mo, then I may well rehearse
Thus double Fort^ne, when she ly^t reuerse
Her slypper favor, fro them that in her tru^t
She flies her way, and lies him in the dust^
She suddenly enhaunce him a lofte
And suddenly myscheuyth, all the flock^
The head that late lay, easily and soft
Instead of pylouse, lies after on the block
And yet alas, the cruel proud mock
The deyntye mouth, that ladies kyssed have
She brings in the case, to kiss a knave.
Thu^ when she cha^nseth, her uncertain course
Up starteth a knave, and down there fall^th a knight
The beggar rich, and the rich man poor i^
Hatred is turned to love, Love to despyght
This is her sport, thus proves she her might
Great bo^t she makes, if one be by her power
welthy^ and wretched, both in an hour.
Po^^^te that of her gyf^es, will no thing tak^
with me^y chere, she looks on the prese
And sees how f^rtunes, how should go (...) w^ake
Fast by h^^ stands, the wise Socrates
Aristippus, Pithagoras, and many a life
Of old Phylosophe^^, and eke against y^ son
B^ke^h him ^ore D^^^^nes in his ^onn^
with her is Bia^, whose country lacked defens^
And whylom of their fooes stood so in dout
That each man hastily began to carry thense
And a^ked him why, ^e naught carried out
I bear quod he, all mine with me about
wisdom he meant, not fortunes brotell fees
For naught he counted his, that he might lose.
Heraclit^s to, list felowsshyp to keep
with glad pouerte, Democrytu^ also
Of which the ^yrs^ can never but weep
To se how thycke, the blind people go
with great labour^, to pur^hale care and (...)
That other laugheth, to se the folysse ap^s
How ^arn^s^ly, they walk about their Iape^^
Of this poor sect, it is the usage
Only to take, that nature may sustain
Banyshynge clean, all other surplusage
They be content, and o^ no^hynge complayn^
No n^garde e^e, is of his gold so feign
But they more pleasure ^aue, a thousand fol^^
The s^c^ete draugh^es of nature and to behold.
Set fortunes servants by them and ye wull
That one is fre, that other ^uer thrall
That one content, that other never full
That one in suerty, that other like to fall
who list to advise them, both perceive ye shall
As great dyfference between them, as we se
Betwyxte wretchedness, and felycyte.
Now have I showed you both, ^hese which ye (...)
Stately fortune, or humble pouerte
That is to say, now lies it in your fyst
To take you to bondage, or fre lyberte
But in this point, and ye do after me
Draw you to fortune, and labor her to please
If that ye think your self, to well at ease.
And first upon the, lovely shall she smyle
And friendly on the cast, her wandering eyes
Embrace the in her armies, and for a while
Put the into a fol^s paradyse
And forthwith all, what so thou list deuyse
She will the grant it, lyberally perhaps
But for all that beware of after clappes.
Rekyn you never, of her favor sure
Ye may in the clouds, as easily trace an ha^^
Or in dry land cause fysshes to endure
And make the burning fire his hete ^o spare
As all this world encompasse to forfare
A^ her to make by c^afte, or engyne stable
That of her nature, i^ (...) varyable.
Serve her day and night, as reuerntly
Upon thy knees, as any servant may
And in conclusion, that thou shall win ther^y
Shall not be worth thy service I dare say
And yet, look what she gives the to day
with labor won, she shall happily to morrow
Pluck it out of thy hand again with sorowe^
wherefore if thou in suerte lift to stand
Take pouerties part, and le^ proud fortune go
Receive nothing that comes from he^ hand
Love manner and virtue, for they be only tho
which double fortune may never take the fro
The^ may thou boldly defy her turnynge chance
She can the neither hyn^er, nor anaunce.
Bu^ and thou wylt needs meddle with her tresure
Trust not therein, and spend it lyberally
Bear ^he not proud, nor take not out of mesure
Bylde not thine house, high up in the sky
None falls far, but he that clynbeth hye
Remember nature sent the hither bare
The gifts of fortune count the^, as borrowed ware
who so delyteth to prouen and assaye
Of wauerynge fortune, the full uncertain lot
If that the answer please ye not always
Blame not me for I command ye not
Fortune to trust, and eke full well ye wo^
I have of her no bridle in my fyst
She re^neth loose, and turns where she lyst^
The rollyng dyse, in who^ your luck does sta^^
with whose unhappy chance ye be so wrought
Ye know your self, came neue^ in mine hand
^o in this ponde, be fysshes and frogs both
Cast in your net, b^t be ye lyefe orloth
Hold you content a^ Fortune lift assygne
It is your own fysshynge and not mine.
And though in one chance fortune you offen^^
Grudge not thereat, but bear a merry face
In many another, she shall it amend
There is no man so ^^t out of her grace
But he sometime, has comfort and solace
Ne none again so set forth in her favor
That fully satyfyed is with her behauyou^^.
Fortune is stately, solemn, proud, and hye
And riches gyu^th, to have service therefore
The ^edy beggar catches an hal^e penny
Some man a.M. pound some less some more
But for all that, she keeps ever in store
From every man some parcel of his will
That he may pray therefore, and serve her ^^y^^.
Some man has good, but children has none
Some man has both, but he can get none he^t^
Some has all three, but up to honors trone
Can he not crepe by no manner of stelth
To some she sends, children, riches wealth
Honor, worship, and reverence all his life
But yet she pyncheth him, with a shrewed wife.
Then for as much as it is fortunes gayse
To grant no man all thing that he will axe
But as her self list order and deuyse
Does every man his part dyuyde and tax
I counceyll you trusse up your packys
And take nothing at all, or be content
With such reward, as fortune has you sent.
All things in this book that ye shall ^ede
Do as ye list, there shall no man you bind
Them to believe, as surely as your creed
But notwithstanding, certyes in my mind
I durst well swear, as true ye shall the^ find
In every point, each answer by and by
^s are the judgments of Astronomye^
Here Fineth Lady Fortune.
