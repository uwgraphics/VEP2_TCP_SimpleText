The Prologue
AMids the twynnes when (...)
Fair Cithera, and Iout beingue.
Last over went by his course right,
That he with them had conioyning:
Commodiously mitigating,
^ath Mars and Saturns malice grette,
Which in the Crabbe but lately met.
Likewise Lucina, then her decte,
With each planet diligently,
Her self to join with like aspecte,
Beginning first with Mercury:
To Jupiter consequently,
With Soland Cithera in haste,
With Saturn then, and Mars at last,
Almighty God that all has wroughte,
Thus through their course most natural,
Within three signs together brought,
These sterres that cr^atykes men call:
In these three were these planets all,
The Crab, the Twyns the horned Bull,
Of wonders thus his works are full.
At this time as for my solase,
To bany she pensive heaviness:
I went abroad the time to pass,
When thought my soul did sore oppress:
Calling my muses to to relese,
My soul, which did in sorrow smarte,
Who aye were wont to ease my heart.
The Muses nine I mean which teach,
And Christen poets illuminate,
(...) with pen or mouth they preach,
(...) ^ertuous and most godly rate:
Of grace and knowledge they the gate
Do open in most gentle wise,
To all that goodness exercise.
The first of these is virtue fair,
Which some men do Arete call.
The second faith which does repair,
To saving health as principal.
The third place lady hope have shall.
The fourth is love: and wisdom five,
Which do with grace right well reuyue.
Daine temperance the sixth muse is.
The seventh is dame patience.
The eight a lady full of blis.
To constancy in good pretense.
The nynthe of good experience,
Is mekenes, or humility,
The purchasers of Gods mercy.
To these as I before have said,
I made my playnte still as I went,
Desyring them of help and aid,
Else am I all in pieces rent:
For ignorance most pestilent,
With her son error me assail,
And would against my soul prevail.
At lest (quod I) dear helps alas,
Let come Arete, and dame Spes:
Brynging with them dame Charitas,
That they my heart may bring to ease.
And take from me my great disease:
This ougly grief vile ignorance,
And in her stead knowledge advance.
At last I sat down on a grene,
Unto a bank lenyng my back:
But Phoebus beams so whot did shine,
That it constreined me to take,
The shade under the fresh grene brake.
Not far from me then straight I spyde,
A grove which was there hard beside:
Where as each bird, with y^ sweet noise
That nature gave them to endure,
Began my heart for to rejoice,
Their notes my thought were so demure:
Which in short space did me procure,
My thoughtfull heart for to apalle,
That I into a sleep began fall.
But in this slumber as I lay,
My spirit receyude no quiet rest.
Wherefore I wakte again streightwaye,
So sore encombred was my breast:
Which sought thereof to be relest.
Thus on my muses began I crave,
Take pity on your simple slave.
But then a fresh I herd again,
The birds that sang so sweet a note,
To whom I said with glad heart feign,
Now Christ his blessing on your throat:
And to my mind it came I wot,
With laud and praise for to advance,
In them the Lords high ordinance,
O God (quod I) omnipotente,
We render the with hearts so pure,
All laud and praise with good intent.
Thy handy works do me allure,
That my heart can right well endure,
For ever in this place to dwell.
And straight again on sleep I fell.
But sure I had not rested long,
Yer that into a dream I fell.
I saw my thought the flowers among
Fair ladies three, which did excel
The praise that any tongue can tell,
Aprochyng toward me full fast,
For soth I was right sore agaste.
Me thought they compaste me about,
Standing as in a syrcle train,
The midlemoste without all doubt,
Did far excelle the other twain,
Them to behold my heart was feign:
Forsothe it was a semely syghte,
My heart therein did much delyghte.
As I did earnestly behold,
These ladies three that wear so bright.
From care my heart began unfold:
For I received per^ec^e syghte,
That madame hope so full of might,
Was one of that same ladies three,
That so about had compast me.
Of whom I had the knowledge found,
By readyng of the word of God.
As I beheld her in that stounde,
Her head at me she began to nod.
Then from my heart the heavy lode,
Consumde away, with all my thought:
For hope was come whom I had sought.
Then up to her my hands I cast,
And kneled down upon the ground:
Welcome (quod I) my hearts repaste,
That I have sought, now have I found.
The healer up of this my wound.
That justice has so fiersly made,
With thought, that sharp and cuttyng blade.
She took me then in her arms twain,
And thus to me she sweetly said.
Be strong (quod she) stand up again,
Oh man why shouldste thou be a^^ayde,
For God has made me for thine aid:
To thee we are sent from above,
Both virtue, hope, and also love.
To love then did I turn my face,
And unto her I bowde my knee.
And gently she did me embrace,
Be of good chere O man (quod she:)
For here is also come to thee,
(According to thy prayer true)
Arete or lady virtue.
When I had heard how they had said,
That lady virtue was in place,
My heart forfothe was sore dismayde,
And color rose straight in my face:
And down I fell before her grace,
Desyryng her benevolence,
To pardon my rude negligence.
That lady then did me behold,
And stepte and caught me by the hand.
Be not dismayde (quod she) be bold,
And up vpryght before me stand:
For I do the to understand,
That I am come down from above,
And brought with me both hope and love.
To hope and love then did she call,
And thus began her tale to tell.
Mark well (said she,) for show I shall,
How men from them do me expel,
And against their lord God rebel:
Estemyng me but of small price,
And wholly give them selves to vice.
The lord did ordeyne me for man,
That I should richely him endue.
Why do they thus forsake me than,
And sin and vice so much ensue?
Forsooth, because they be untrue,
Regardyng their own wit and will,
And will not hark gods word until.
Gods word, no no, alas therefore,
There is no thing I dare w^ll say,
That worldly men do more abhor,
He that has wit perceive it may:
Their outward works do them bewraye,
For when gods word byds them amend,
With reason they the^r vyc^ defend.
And to be brief now each estate,
Does seek all m^anes vice to maynteyne:
And are with meat great debate,
So that I do not ryghtly reign.
At me the most part have disd^yne:
All save a few do me resist,
Which seweat, the elect of Christ.
And thou O man mark what I say,
To the I will my mind declare:
That thou may now perceive the way,
Of worldly m^n, and how they fare:
That afterward thou may prepare
Thy self to do and work my will,
In that which I say the until.
Their pride they name now cleanlynes,
And avarice is polycie:
So do they name wrath manlynes,
And love they call vile lechery,
Namyng envy good memory.
They call glutony fare honest
And sloth they call natural rest.
Extortion lawful gettyng,
Idolatry catholyke faith,
Usury is wytty wynning,
Vice is virtue as each man says:
But in the truth who now him stays?
Rebellyon is commonwealth,
And manly shifte, robrie and stelth.
Oppression is good governance,
Crueines is severity,
The prodigal their deeds advance,
And call it lyberalytie.
And Sodoms sin is chastity,
Among those which compte marriage sin,
Whose wickedness will never blynne.
Some live in wylfull poverty,
And beggars have the proudest heart.
Thus wade they in hypocrisy,
And idleness for the most part,
Which causes virtue to depart:
For idleness the mother is,
Of all mischief and things amys.
It is a thing ay incident,
That each man has felicity,
On some one thing the mind is bente,
In wysdomes schole, or in folly:
And do their minds wholly aplye,
That they may it attain and get,
Whereon their heart is fyxte and set.
The covetous delyghte in goulde,
The lechour in his fleshly lust.
The proud would have all men behold,
Their painted shethe of dounge and duste:
The slothful sleep, and slomber must,
The wrathful and the envious noye:
Whose whole delyghte is to destroy.
The glutions love their panche to fill.
The dronkards do delyghte in drink:
And each of these to have their will,
No cost nor charge to great they think:
Thus in a fancy all men synke,
And each man's care is to aspyre,
Unto his lust and hearts desire.
Some study in Astronomy,
Delyghting to behold the sterres,
Some in musyke and harmony,
And cosmographie some preferres.
Some in fygures, some in numbers.
Some do delyghte philosophy,
To know on earth each herb and tree.
The fowlers have their whole delyghte,
To deuyse engyns birds to take:
Such as in fyshing have a sight,
They angles and their net^es will make,
And take great pain for fancies sake.
The faulkners hawk is his pleasure,
The hunter will good hounds procure.
In all things either good or ill,
That man does follow or embrace,
Felicity they have and will:
Their hearts desire for to purchase.
Then happy are they which by grace,
Love virtues supernatural,
Which bryghtly shyneth above all.
Ye happy are those men I say,
That have in virtue their delyghte:
For in their sorrow they will pray,
For help and aid to God almyghte,
And in their mirth their faith most right,
Does cause them noty psaimes to sing,
And spiritual song^s to his praysyng.
As vice does cause delyght in sin,
To follow all iniquity,
And always seeks ways to win,
Men's souls in wretched vylaynie:
So virtue in the contrary,
Does by all means her self behave,
The soul of man to bless and save.
O then you that my servants be,
In me have all your exercise.
And as ye do delyght in me,
So look that y^ do enterprise,
All good things virtuous and wise:
That by your badge it may be seen,
That I am your lady and queen.
Such as in carnal love rejoice,
Trim songs of love they will compile,
And synfully with tune and voice
They sing their songs in pleasant style,
To Venus that same strompet vile:
And make of her a godd^s oere,
In lecherte that had no perc.
A book also of songs they have,
And Venus court they do it name,
No fylthy mind a song can crave,
But therein he may find the same:
And in such songs is all their game.
Whereof right diverse books be made,
To nuryshe that most fylthy trade.
I will that my servants therefore
Shall be as apt me for to serve,
In praise of God sin to abhor*
And from me Virtue not to swerue.
That they may godly fame deserve,
Of good men here, and after this
To reign with God in heaven blys.
As prayer in sadness is mete:
In myrthe so godly songs to sing,
For Christen men to this is fytte.
I charge thee therefore with this thing:
That thou thine exercise do bring,
To make a book of songs holy,
Godly and wise, blamyng folly.
To which book godly men may add,
(From time to time as they see cause,)
Right sober songs godly and sad,
Compyled of gods holy laws:
Of virtue and wise old said sawes,
That may to goodness men procure,
While here their life days do endure.
As thou will therefore at thy need,
Have hope and love and also me,
Se thou accomplish this with speed:
My systers twain thereto agree.
And then they warned me all three,
That in this thing I should not stay,
But make that book without delay.
My cunnyng small though then I knew,
In each degree my wit full weak:
Though lack of learning eke I rue,
Yet of excuse I durst not speak:
But granted my poor head to break,
About such exercise, as she
So streyghtly had commanded me.
At that instant they did me kys,
And friendly did from me depart,
To heaven they went all Iwys,
And left me with an heavy heart:
So their departure made me smarte.
And in that thought I waked thore,
Merueyling at my dream full sore.
In songs therefore sithe I must wade,
According as my dream me ^oulde,
I will delyght to tread the trade
That lady virtue said I should:
As blind bayard none is so ^oulde,
And first for lady virtues sake,
A song in her praise will I make.
And then in mo proceed I will,
As God shall give me of his grace.
My wit is rude, and small my skyll,
To stand and supply such a place.
Yet must I needs walk in the trace,
That virtue did assign me in,
Therefore in her praise I begin.
The Court of Virtue.
The praise of virtue.
^ AL men that will walk in Gods divine ways,
^ To virtue they must give honor and praise:
^ For virtue is she by whom they possess,
^ All good fame and praise that love godlynes.
There never was man that wan godly fame,
But doubtless dame virtue was cause of the same.
Though Abram by faith, was only made just,
By virtue that fay the was known and discuste.
Ye Isaac and Jacob, were compted like wise,
Both faithful and just in their exercise.
The patriarchs all from Adam to Christ,
With prophets and kings, that sin did resist.
By virtue the praise of faith did obtain:
Which yet to this day, does dure and remain.
Ye Christ by the virtue, that in him was sent,
Above all the holy, that holiest have been,
To be true Mesias, his flock did him know:
Which to this day does his foes overthrow.
And he his disciples then charged each one,
To follow the steps that he so had gone.
Likewise his Apostles, that since his time was,
The martyrs and saints, to whom he gave grace,
Their light did so shine, before the world here:
That by their true virtue, well did appear,
That they were true servants, of Christ their good lord,
Whom truly their lives, did preach and record.
Let virtue therefore be had in all pryse,
Which still to goodness, does good men entyse.
And well does reward, all such as her serve,
And keeps naught back, that they do deserve:
But with goodness still, does rychly augmente,
All such as unto her service be bent.
And never does leave them, ne yet forsake,
Till ended be all, that they undertake.
She never does sease, to spur them forward,
Till they be in bliss of heu^ns reward.
Which is the whole thing they seek for and sue,
That serve in the court of Lady virtue.
And still for her sake, do suffer and bide,
The stumps and the mocks, of such as deryde.
Ye hatred and scorn, and all kind of spyghte,
Of such as in vice and sin do delyght.
But virtue does t^ache, to suffer this rage,
That we may still pass on in our pylgrimage.
Considering that we but strangers are here.
And wander still toward our country dear.
And make ou^ selves light, from burden and lode,
Sithe in this vain world, is no sure abode.
No marvel though then the world does them hate,
And ever be still with them at debate:
For Christ unto his has made it well known,
The world shall aye love and favor his own.
And those from the world and sin that remove,
It is not possible, the world should them love.
The cause as says Christ, of all this whole strife:
Is that from the world they differ in life.
For as in this world no man's life is sure,
The virtuous life shall eternally dure.
Though here they be murdered and (seen for to die)
Of such as all virtue and goodness deny.
Then how can we count them short time to live,
To whom lady virtue reward does, give.
Whom as say^h Gelasius, ought still to be.
From teror and dread, and wrath ever free.
Her consolation where she does bestow,
In rich or in poor, in high or in low,
From bondage of sin she does them free make:
Lo thus are her servants safe for her sake.
Among the good roots that depely besette,
Virtue says Tullie, the chief praise does getie:
The which by no kind of vyolence may
Be hurt or destroyde, by night or by day.
From wanton desires her servants flee all.
And follow still justice, as says saint Paul:
Faith love and vni^ie well does accord,
In them which with clean hearts ^onor the Lord.
Lactancius also would all men remember,
That they the true honor to virtue do render.
With sensing or prayer she honor has none,
Nor yet with an Image, of woodde or of stone:
But only with good will and purpose true,
This honor to virtue, alwayse is due:
For he that in Christ's faith does not remain,
In no wise to virtue may apertayne.
Virtue refreyneth wrath without measure,
And also absteyneth from carnal pleasure:
The fruits of the spiritie, as true godly love,
Patience, and peace, and joy from about.
Bounteousnes, goodness, and long sufferance,
Gentleness, faith, and modest, temperance.
Sobernes, continence, and chastity:
All these in virtues court officers be.
Therefore the queen virtue, it may well beseme,
To were a most high and rich diadeine.
The praise of faith. Hebre. 11.
^ IF I shall enterprise to make,
^ A due praise unto faith:
^ I can in no wise better that,
^ Which written is of Paul,
^ In his epistle to the Iues:
^ mark therefore what he says,
^ though not each word, yet will
^ I here resite the sum of all.
Faith is a perfect confidence,
Of things that hoped are,
And a most constant certeintie.
Of things which are not seen.
For thereby did the fathers old,
(As scripture does declare,)
Obtain a just and good report,
That long time since has been.
And we through faith do understand,
God did the world ordeyne,
By Christ his son the blessed word,
That no beginning had.
By it also how things were wrought,
We do knowledge obtain:
Things that are seen by things not seen,
Were ordained and made.
By faith also (as we do read,)
The ryghteous man Abell,
Did offer up a sacrifice,
More plentyfull then Cayne:
And thereby had a wytnes true,
(As holy write does tell,)
That he was just: Though he be dead,
His fame does still remain.
By faith Enoch, translated was,
That death he should not see,
And was not found: for god therefore
Had taken him away.
Before which time he wan the name,
A ryghteous man to be,
Because he did the will of god,
And pleased him night and day.
But sure without a lyvly faith,
It can be in no wise,
That any man by any mean,
The living god should please:
For all that come to god believe,
(And their faith exercise,)
That he rewards them that seek
Him, with eternal ease.
By faith Noe (being warnde of god,)
Unseen things did eschew,
Preparde an arc, and savde his folk,
As holy scripture says.
Whereby he did ccondemne the world,
That sin did still ensue:
And became heir of ryghteousnes,
According unto faith.
By faith our father Abraham,
When he first called was,
To go into a place most strange,
Did by and by obey.
Which place though he, inherit should,
As after came to pas:
When he went forth he knew it not,
Nor no part of the way.
By faith into the promyste land,
I say he did remove,
A strange country where he did long,
In tabernacles dwell:
And so did Isaac and Jacob,
Heirs with him from above.
All these did for a city look,
Which God had builded well.
Through faith Sara received strength,
When she was now past age,
To conceive and bring forth a son,
That perfect was and pure:
Because she iudgde the promyser
Both faithful, true, and sage.
Lo thus by faith there sprang great health,
Where thought was no recure.
And therefore sprang there forth of one,
That dead was to esteem,
As many folk in multitude,
As are stars in the sky:
And as the sand on the sea shore,
Her ofspryng then did seem,
The which without number to be,
No creature can deny.
These dyed in faith, yet the promys
None of them did receive:
But seeing it as afar of,
They did right well believe,
That as many as so it saw,
And to the same did cleave,
Salutyng it by livly faith,
None evil should them grieve.
These faithful men the fathers old,
As truth was did confess,
That they strangers and pilgrymes wear,
Upon this earthly vale.
For they that see such things before,
Of truth declare no less,
But that they do a country seek,
Right high above this dale.
Also if they had minded once,
The country whence they came,
They had leysour to turn again,
To that which they did love:
But now it shows they did desire,
A thing of better fame,
That is to say a heavenly soil,
With God the lord above.
Wherefore the living God him self,
Estemeth it no shame,
To be called the God of these,
And such like godly men:
For he a city excellent,
Has builded for the same,
And thinks nothing ill bestowde,
That may well pleasure them.
Who so the text will farther read,
To follow there shall find.
That Isac, Jacob, and Joseph,
And Moses did the like:
By faith how the red sea went back,
Contrary to his kind:
As on dry land how Israel
did pass through that dry dyke.
The Egiptians when they the like
Would seem to enterprise,
They lackyng faith wear drowned all,
As for their t^st reward.
By faith the walls of Ierico,
Did fall down in like wise,
No force or engyn of the wars,
Against it once preparde.
The harlot Rahab in like wise,
Now she did save her life,
And perished not with them that did
Resist the will of god:
When she the spies received well,
In peace without all strife:
For she beleude, that god would plage,
That country with his rod.
What should be said of Gedeon,
Of Barach, and Samson:
Iephte, David, and Samuel,
And eke the prophets all.
Who did by faith great realms subdue
And mighty kingdoms won:
They turnde their enemies to flight,
And gave their foes a fall.
By faith some stopped the lions mouths,
Some quenched the rage of fire:
By faith some wrought out rightousnes,
Some promise did obtain.
Some scapie the sword, some were made strong,
Whom weakness erste did tire:
And women did their dead receive,
To perfect life again.
Some racked wear, and would not void
The danger of that woe,
Knowing that they should rise again,
Possessing better joy.
With mockes and scorns and prisonment,
Lo some were tried so:
Some were stoned, some were tempted,
Thus did the world them noye.
Some hewed were a sonder quyghte,
Some with the sword were slain:
Some in the skynnes of sheep and gotes
Disdeyned not to go,
In trouble and necessity,
They were content to reign
In mountains, deserts, and in dens,
By faith this could they do.
These, was the world not worthy of,
Yet did it them despise.
Though they did all (through lyuly faith)
Obtain a good report:
Yet did they not that time receive,
That God did them promise:
That we with them, and they with us,
might ioynctly have comfort.
For Christ that holy promise was,
The fruit of all our faith:
Without whom none can saved be,
No neither we nor they,
For in him all fulfilled is,
That holy scripture says:
Ye Christ is he in whom both we
And they our faith do stay.
For which all honor laud and praise
To God ascribed be,
To the father, and to the son,
And to the holy spyrite:
In unity, and trinity.
One God and persons three,
As has been, is and shall be still,
For ever so be it.
The praise of hope, out of many places of scripture.
^ HOpe (the medcyn against dreadful despair)
^ If we should praise as does her well behoue,
^ As holy Paull we need had to repair,
^ to the third heaven: or else God from above
^ to sound his voice, to one that he does love:
^ as in the holy mount Moses did here,
^ And to Elias likewise did apere.
Or as the most blessed Apostles three,
At Olyuet, even Peter, James, and John,
Where they the glory of the Lord did see,
Transfigured that holy mount upon:
Beside which sight, they herd this voice each one:
This is mine only son and word so bryghte,
In whom I fix and set my whole delyght.
Who so I say might once have such a syghte,
Should afterward lack no knowledge nor skyll,
To praise dame hope, that lady pure and bright:
In whom all good men have of joy their fill.
Who could without despair suffer the ill,
That in this world we daily see and bide,
If blessed hope stood not on our right side?
Our spiritual foes that daily us asaulte,
As is the fend, the flesh, and world also,
With ignorance and error eke so haulte,
Behind, before, we no where lack a foe,
So that if hope once banyshte were us fro,
Alas who could of gods favor be sure,
That daily sethe his own ways so vnpure?
What man does as god has commanded plain,
That we should do, or else perysh in hell?
Since none therefore can there unto attain,
(For all do disobey, sin and rebel:
How can we think in heaven then to dwell,
If blessed hope do not our faith direct,
That we in Christ are unto bliss elect.
In all the storms of Satan's cruel rage,
Wherewith he seeks man's soul to destroy.
If in our souls good hope did not aswage,
The sorrows that do seek the same to noye,
And comfort them with quietness and toye,
Assuryng them that do their whole good will,
That Christ our lord will all our want fulfill:
Without this hope I say who could Endure.
The boystrous brunte of this most mortal fight,
Our enmies are no babes I you assure,
But very strong in respect of our might:
Wherefore we ought to pray both day and night,
To god our lord, that he would grant us aye,
That blessed hope with us continue may.
How apt are we from comfort to decay,
If we her help had not in our distres.
Since she in Christ does cause us for to stay,
And to be bold not fearyng our weakness.
Sith our captain in his great manlynes,
Is able still our foes for to withstand,
If we in him that battle take in hand.
As says saint Paul hope is the geft of god,
In which we are made safe in all our need,
And takes away of care the heavy lode,
An armor strong, and spiritual indede,
An helmet sure, wherewith we may proceed
Against the powers of darkness and of hell,
For heavenly things that we may wrestle well.
In it we ought to joy and to rejoice,
As to the Romans he does farther say:
And Peter also, with a fervent voice,
Says that we ought without all doubt and stay,
To yield a reason of our hope always.
Hope is the mean that men to God draw nere,
without the which none faithful may apere.
Who without hope can truly love the lord?
Who without hope can serve god in true fear?
Who without hope can cause his life tacorde
To virtues lore, and fylthy sins forbear?
Who without hope can pray in true manner?
Who without hope can yield god laud and praise?
Who void of hope will walk in Christen ways?
The blessed martyrs, by the hope and trust,
That they had in the glorious life to come,
Did from this world withdraw their mind and lust:
And gladly suffered cruel martyrdom,
By fire, by sword, and briefly all the sum,
No kind of death or tormente did despise,
That wicked worldlynges could for them deuyse.
By hearing scripture true hope does proceed,
And otherwise can lightly not be had,
Confounded shall they never be in deed,
Whom perfect hope has once with joy made glad:
Which takes away all doubtful dred so sad.
Whose hope in Christ therefore does stay and rest,
We may well call them faithful folk and bleste.
What so before time written is says Paul,
It written was us to instruct and learn:
That we through comfort of the scriptures all,
And patience: might perfectly deserne
The perfect hope, to hope in God eterne.
Lo thus does God in scripture us procure,
Through hope in him of heaven to be sure.
We know says Paul that tribulacion,
Does bring forth patience, that goodly grace,
And patience does render forth anon
Experience, the which does hope purchase:
Which blessed hope who so that may embrace,
She never will confound them with no shame,
But brings forth a life free from all blame.
This pure and perfect hope that we declare
The gift is of the Lord and at his will,
Which none can get by worldly wit nor care:
But with this hope god his elect does fill,
With whom she does continue ever still:
Not by man's will, but by gods mercy pure:
This blessed hope with good men does endure.
The God of hope therefore replenysh us,
With peace and joy, and with a lyvly faith,
And make us rich in hope of Christ Jesus,
And tholy ghost, whose power all mistruste stayth,
Which is our comfort as the scripture says.
This Trimtie be praised now therefore,
As has been, is, and shall be evermore.
The praise of Godly love or charity out of 1. Cor. 13. and John. 4.
^ OF Charity or godly love
^ To make a perfect praise,
^ This godly love to praise I say,
^ In order good and due.
^ I took to me gods word, and wrote
^ What the holy gooste says,
^ In divine John and holy Paul:
^ whose words are very true.
Attend therefore ye Christians dear,
And lovers of the Lord,
Hark and give ear unto the truth,
And blessed word of life:
And pray to god for perfect love,
Your lives thereto accord,
That ye may live in christen peace,
Free from all seruyle strife.
By office of a lyvly faith
What ever we receive,
Or by the office of our hope,
What so we do retain:
By charity or godly love,
To gods truth if we cleave:
The fruit thereof we must apply,
To render well again.
As faith the first preferment has
our souls to justify,
(For by the same we only do
Receive our saving health:)
So love of virtues is the chief,
Whereby we edefie,
By it we work the will of god,
And seek our neighbors wealth.
Though I could speak says Paul with tongues
Of men orangels bryghte,
And had no love: then were I like
Unto the soundyng bras,
Or like the ^ynklyng simbales sound,
A short and vain delyght:
Which being gone, men straight forget
What manner noise it was.
Ye though that I could prophecy,
And secrets understand,
All knowledge, or such mighty faith,
As could mountayns remove,
And set them in the oc^an seas,
Or in some other land:
For all these yet I were nothing
If that I had not love.
If I did all my goods bestow
To feed therewith the poor,
Or give my body to the fire,
Therein consumde to be,
And finally all that I can,
Till I could do no more:
If I be destitute of love,
It does not profit me.
Love suffers long, is courteous,
And never does envy,
Love never deals frowardly,
Nor venemously swell.
Love seeks not her own, thereby
To deal dishonestly.
Love unto wrath provoke not,
But always thinks well.
In euels love does not rejoice,
Nor Joy in wyckednes,
But always does rejoice in truth,
And suffers all things well:
Believes all, and hops all,
And does endure no les.
Thus love in goodness does excede,
All that our tongues can tell,
Though prophesiyng do fail, and serve
No use in any case,
And tongues to speak, and knoledge to
As once they shall I say:
(After this life these have no use,)
Yet love shall then in place,
Remain, with gods elect in joys,
And never fall away.
Our knowledge is but imperfect,
So is our prophesiyng,
When perfectnes does come in place,
Imperfectness must flee:
For when I was a child, my talk
Was then chyldysh talking:
Mine understanding in like case,
All then was chyldyshly.
And as a child also that time
I did imagine plain:
But then so sone as manhod came,
My chyldishnes was gone.
Now see we but as in a glass
By speech most dark and vain:
But then shall we see face to face,
When let there shall be none.
My knowledge now imperfect is,
Then shall it not be so,
Then shall I know as I am known,
By rule of right b^liefe.
Faith hope and love do now abide
Away they will not go:
And of all those after this life,
Love shall abide as chief.
Saint John diuinly counsels us
One an other to love,
For every one that loves says he,
Of God is truly borne.
For love does ever suerly come
From God the lord above:
Such as love not, do not know god,
But rather do him scorn.
In this the love of god to us
Does perfectly apere.
He (but not we) did truly love
And pain for us did take:
For he into this world did send
His only son so dear,
That for our sins he might thereby
A full agreement make.
Wherefore (my loving brethern dear)
If god so loved us,
That we should one another love,
W^ certeynly are bound:
If we love one an other then,
Our love does plain discuss,
That god in us does dwell and reygne,
And has a perfect ground.
For god is love, and who so does
In love abide or dwell,
Dwelle^h in god and god in him,
Thus love in us is sure:
That in the day of judgment just
We should in hope excel.
For in this world we are like him,
By love perfect and pure.
By this we know the godly love,
That there in is no fear:
It casts out all fear and doubt
Wherein is paynfulnes.
Where ^^^or i^ the perfect love
In nowyse can be there,
For love does always fix her self
On peace and gentylnes.
If we love god, he loud us first,
Then whereof can we boste?
But who so says he loves God,
And does his brother hate:
He is a liar verily,
And none of Christ's host:
And thereby does provoke the plage
To light upon his pa^e.
For how can he that loves not
His brother in this life,
Whom he may with his eyes behold,
At all times when he will:
How can he with the living god
Be other then at strife?
Or love him which he can not se^
By nature or by skyll?
Therefore has Christ commanded v^*
That he which loves god,
By perfect love as he forbeares
All that god does abhor:
That he also his brother love,
All hate is him forbod.
All honor praise and laud to god
For this now ever more.
Amen.
The praise of Godly wisdom out of the book of wisdom, called Sapientia.
cap. vi.
^ THe worthy wise king Solomon
^ inwysdoms exercise,
^ The godly wisdom does commend,
^ And praise her on this wise.
^ wisdomis a much better thing,
^ Then strength orforce to fight:
^ a wise man is more worth also,
^ Then strong men of much might.
This wisdom O ye myghtie kings
Se that ye conne and learn,
To you since judgment on this earth
Is given to decerne.
Give ^are to her I say all you,
That rule the multitude,
Which in much people have delight.
And all things should conclude.
The god that gave you power and strength
That lord I say most hye,
Shall search out all that ye inuente,
And your works truly try.
How that ye being officers
Under his kyngly throne,
Ye did not judgment execute
As unto him is known.
And if ye have not kept the law
Of ryghtiusnes I say,
Nor have not done his blessed will
By walkyng in his way:
Full horribly and that right sone
To you he shall apere,
And right hard judgment shall they have
By power that govern here.
His mercy sure he will extend
Unto the innocent,
But such as bear authority,
Shall have sore punishment,
For god which is the lord of all,
By judgment just and right
Shall stand in awe of no man's power,
Though he be of great might.
For he made both the great and small,
And cares for them alyke:
But they that be of greatest power
The more he will them stryke.
Ye kings each one take heed therefore,
Se that ye ponder this,
And guide your fete by wisdoms scole
That ye go not amysse.
All such as observe ryghteousnes,
Shall judged be thereby,
Such right cousnes who so will learn
Shall answer readily.
On wisdoms lore I say therefore
Set all your love and lust:
To nourture so ye shall atayne,
In season due and just.
For wisdom is a noble thing.
Which will not flete nor move,
And will be seen full easily
Of all that do her love:
Such as unfeignedly her seek,
She will prevent them so,
That they shall have her in their syghte.
In each place where they go.
Who so will wake to her betyme
Shall have no great traueyle,
For at his door he shall her find,
She will him never fail.
Right perfectly they understand
That do think her upon,
And they that watch for her shall be
Right safe and that anon.
For she alwayse does go about
And seeks every where,
For such as for her schole be mete,
And do god love and fear:
Before their eyes right chierfully
Her self she does forth show,
And meteth them dilygently,
Because they should her know.
The faithful and the just desire
Of reformation,
Is the beginning and the ground
That wisdom builds on.
The busye care for wysdom^ lore
Is love and pure prudence,
And love does also keep the laws,
And that with dilygence.
To keep the laws is perfectnes,
And righ^ly does accord.
An vncerrupt life makes man
Familiar with the lord.
Se that your joy in royal seats
And scepters be not set,
Ye kings that do the people rule,
By mighty power and great.
But set on wysdom your delyght,
All folysh things abhor:
That ye may reign in glory great
With god for ever more.
O love the light, all ye that rule
The congregation:
And I will make of wisdom now
A declaration.
What wisdom is, how she came up,
I will you tell this tide,
The mysteries of god the lord.
From you I will not hyde:
But I will seek her out in deed,
That all men shall it se
Ye from the first oryginall
Of her nativity.
And bring the knowledge of her light.
And show you all the ground.
And as for keeping back the truth,
In me shall not be found:
Ne yet will I have ought to do
With envy nor disdain.
For why such men in no wise may
To wisdom aperteyne.
Where many wise men have abode
The world may joyful be:
And where as kings by wisdom rule,
Their realms have equity.
O aprehende her nurtour then,
Let wysdom be your food:
And at my words your council take
For it shall do you good.
I am a mortal man my self
After the common trade,
And am of that same very kind,
With him that first was made:
And formed in my mothers womb
In flesh there was I wrought,
And ten months had my nutryment
Of blood that there was brought.
Where through the fruitful seed of man
I had my substance thus,
In which the apetite of sleep,
Is most commodious.
When I was borne I took like air,
As do all others lo:
I fell on earth which was my kind
In weeping and in woe
I wraped was in swadlyng clothes,
And brought up with great care:
For why no king can in their birth
Have other kind of fare.
For all men in this wretched world
As well the king as slave,
In entrance, and in going forth,
No kind of difference have.
Considryng in my mind how that
The most rude multitude
did nothing differ from my birth,
Nor death which does conclude.
I me bethought therefore how I
Might in my being here,
Above the kind of common men
Right excellent apere.
For wysdom pure to understand
Therefore was my desire,
The spirit of wysdom came to me
As my heart did require,
By whom I set more price and joy
Then by great kyngdoms fair:
The royal seats or riches great
With her shall not compare.
And precious stones I never did
Compare to her I say,
For gould is g^auell in her sight,
And silver is but claye.
Wealth and beauty I wayed not,
But took her for my light:
The beams of wisdom none can quench
That shyneth aye so bryghte.
By her all things I did possess,
All good thing^s came to me,
The riches without number is
That in her hands still be.
But yet in childyshe ignorance
I could not make dyscourse,
Of all good things how wisdom is
The mother and the nource.
But now sith I unfeignedly
Have learned what she is,
Partakers other men to make
Of her I will not mys.
Her riches and her treasure great
From you I will not hide:
Which passes all infinitely
That is in this world wide.
Which who so use, they joy with god
In friendship and great love:
And in his sight excepted are,
Through wysdomes gifts above.
God has me granted wisdoms talk
In form conu^nient,
To handle all which he to me
Has graciously lent.
For he it is that to wisdom
Does lead and introduce,
And teaches how that in her kind
Men shall her ryghtly use.
In him are we, and all our words,
Our wisdom, and our skyll:
Our knowledge, and our science all,
Our works, and all our will.
For unto me he given has,
The knowledge and the trade
Of all those things, so that I know
How that the world was made:
And by his wisdom has me taught
Astronomy to know,
The elements, with all their powrs,
And wonders which they show.
How times do both begin and end,
The mydste of times I see:
How times alter and do succeed
Each one in his degree.
I know the order and the end
And course or every year,
The dispositions of the stars
To me do well appear.
In natural philosophy
I have the perfect art,
I know the nature of each beast
One from other aparte:
How some be gentill in their kind,
How some in fury rage:
I know the cause, and how one may
By wisdom them aswage.
I know the wyndes of every coaste,
Their natures hot or cold:
And by that art send shyps with sails
To Ophir for much goulde,
What man's imagination is
Some wise some fond and vain:
By Adams line, and wysdoms lore,
The difference shows plain.
I know the natures and degrees
Of each plant in his kind,
All herbs, and roots that grow on earth
Their virtue I can find.
And how they differ in degree
In quality and power:
All secret and unsought knowledge.
Does spryng in wysdoms flower.
Which he has given unto me
That all this world has made,
He taught me how to use this flower
That dures and does not fade.
In her is spirit to understand
In holy exercise,
In knowledge great she does abound,
And all things that are wise.
I say that with almighty God
All only she is one,
Subtle and full of gentylnes,
And gracious alone.
She is courteous and discrete
Quycke, vndesiide, and plain:
Sweet, and does love all that is good,
Reiectyng that is vain.
She is sharp, yet forbideth not
To do ryghtly and well:
Kind, sure, and free, and to be brief
In virtue does excel.
In althynges she is circumspecte
Whereof she takes cure:
All knowing spirits she does receive,
That are both clean and pure.
For wysdom does in nymblenes
All other things excel,
And thereby through all things to pas
She does atayne full well.
For of the living god she is
The breath of power doubtless,
The cleanes of almighty god
Thereby she does express.
Therefore can no defiled thing
Come once within her sight,
For she the very bryghtnes is
Of everlasting light.
She is the myrror vndefylde
Wherein all good men see,
The Image of almighty god
In his great majesty.
And for so much as she is one,
All things are hyrs as due:
And being steadfast in her self,
She does all things renew.
Among the multitude of folk
She does her self conuaye,
And enters into holy souls
In them to bide and stay.
She makes god prophets and friends,
The truth to preach and tell:
For god does love none but such men,
With whom wisdom does dwell.
The son and stars may not compare
With her in light I say:
For why her light does far excede
The brightness of the day.
For be the day never so bright,
Yet night approaches fast,
To quench the beauty of the same
And pattes it out in haste:
But wisdom can not be subdude
I say by wickedness,
Nor in her sight to blemyshe her,
Can bide no folyshnes.
An example of a contemplative mind in the service of God, out of the xxv.
Psalm.
THe noble king David by name,
Having the spirit of truth,
Who ever truly served God,
Even from his very youth:
He knowing that by humblenes
He sonest should aspyre,
To have his prayer heard of God,
And obtain his desire.
Disdeined not upon his knees
Him self to prostrate low,
For sith the heart must humble be,
Let outward members know
That they shall not them selves refrain,
Their duty to express:
My knees therefore shall do their due,
So shall my hands no less.
Mine eyes shall upward also turn
The heavens to behold,
With stretched hands and bowed knees
My prayer to vnsoulde.
My voice I will not silent keep,
But will express with tongue,
The meaning of a faithful hatte,
And sing it in a song.
Debating with him self this thing,
Directing all aryght:
In this wise he began to sing
To god with all his might.
Ad te dominum leuaui.
TO the oh lord I lift my soul,
My god I trust in thee:
O suffer not mine enemies
To tryumphe over me.
Ne yet let such as in thee trust.
Rebuke or shame sustain:
But rather confound scornful men,
That spitefully dysdeyne.
To the I pray my king and god,
O show to me thy wayse:
And teach thy paths O lord to me
Thy name that I may praise.
O lord lead me to speak thy truth,
And learn me to be just:
Mine only god and saving health,
All day in thee I trust.
Forget not lord but call to mind
Thy tender mercy pure,
Let not thy loving kyndnes slack
That ever has been sure.
Forget my sins, remember not
The fraylnes of my youth:
For thy goodness and mercy lord,
Think upon me with ruthe.
O ryghteous lord with frendlynes,
Wytsafe to show thy might:
Whereby thou shall the sinners teach^
To walk thy way a right.
The simple thou do teach and guide
Thy perfect ways to know,
And thou doste such instruct aright
As humble be and low.
Thy ways O lord are merciful,
Thy faythfulnes is bent,
To all that keep thy covenant,
And faithful testament.
For thy names sake therefore O lord
Be merciful to me,
And to my sins that are so great
And mine iniquity.
Who so therefore does fear the lord,
He will him show I say:
His high and his divine precepts,
His pure and chosen way.
His soul shall ever be at ease
His ways shall prosper well:
His sede also shall still possess
The land, therein to dwell.
The lord his secrets does show forth
To such as fear him still,
Declaring them his testament,
His covenant and will.
O lord my god to the therefore,
I will mine eyes dyrecte,
And pray to thee till thou haste losde
My fete out of the net.
O turn thee unto me therefore
Now for thy mercies sake,
Consider lord my mysery
How I am desolate.
The sorrows of my heart are great,
Right sore they do me grieve:
O ryd me from these troubles all,
For in thee I believe.
O look on mine adversity,
And my great mysery:
Forgive me all my sins also
Where I offended thee.
Consider how mine enemies
Are many and peruearte,
That toward me maliciously
Are bent with hateful heart.
Oh preserve thou my soul therefore
Within thy keeping just:
And let me not confounded be,
For in thee do I trust.
Let just dealyng and innocent,
O god still with me dwell:
And from all vile adversity
Deliver Israel,
An example how that we should always be thankful unto almighty God for his
benefits, out of the xxxiiii. psalm of David.
AS in our streightes of need
We all are glad and feign,
Some comfort at the hands of god
By prayer to obtain.
So when we have recevd
Of god our whole desire,
That we should therefore thankful be,
Good reason does require.
For who so benefits
At mortal men receive,
If afterward the geuer does
Ingratitude perceive:
The same will straight withdraw
His liberality,
From such a stubberne block head beast,
As can not frendshyp see.
If vile ingratitude
To men be such a crime,
That it will friendly love keep back,
Against an other time:
What beastly dogs are they?
How can we call them less?
That for great kyndnes of the lord,
Do pay unthankfulness?
Which asks naught of us
But honor laud and praise,
For all the good he does bestow
On us a thousand ways.
Wherefore that noble king,
And prophet of the lord
David, who did after Gods heart
Agree and well accord,
Gods glory does express,
In doing of his due:
And for the benefits of God
His heart declares true:
Not only in him self
To flee ingratitude,
But other also to instruct
That are vnlernde and rude.
In dark oblivion
Gods goodness for to hyde.
Or to forget his benefits
Did never him vetyde.
His harp he took in hand,
And thus began to sing:
That with gods honor laud and praise,
All Israel did ring.
Benedicam dominum.
I Will unto the lord
Be giving thanks always,
My mouth and tungue shall ever be
A speaking of his praise.
My soul shall make her boste,
In God the lord of might,
That poor oppressed men may here
The same, them to delighte.
Together let us now
In honor do our parts,
His name to praise and magnify,
With meke and humble hearts.
For when I him besought,
He heard my prayer so,
That he did straight deliver me,
From all my care and woe.
Receive therefore the light,
And to him draw you nere:
And so without all shamefastnes
Your faces shall appear.
For I poor man made once
To hun my playnte and moan:
He heard me cry, and did me ryd,
From troubles every one.
His angel pytched has
His tente about his sheep,
I mean all such as fear the lord,
In saftie them to keep.
His frendshyp prove and see,
And take thereof a taste:
For they that trust in him are sure
Most happy at the last.
O fear the lord all ye
His saynctes of him elect:
For such as fear him lack nothing.
He does them well protecte.
The lions often do lack
And hunger for their food:
But they which seek the lord, shall want^
Nothing the which is good.
Ye children all I say
Come harken to my voice:
I will you teach to fear the lord,
And in him to rejoice.
If thou to live in joy
And see good days be feign,
Thy lyppes and tongue from guyle and wro^s
See that thou do refrain.
Se that thou do none ill,
In goodness never cease:
But se thou seek and follow fast
On quietness and peace.
The lord does fix his eyes
On just men lovingly,
And to their prayers openly
He does his ears apply.
Contrariwyse the Lord
Does bend his countenance,
Of from the earth ill men to move
And their rememberance.
But to the just the lord
Does so inclyne his ^are,
That when they pray he will them ryd
From all trouble and fear.
The Lord is nyghe to such
As are in heart contrite,
And he will save such as be meke,
And of an humble sprite.
Though just men's troubles be
Both manifold and great,
The lord from care will make them free,
When they do him entreat.
Their bones he will defend,
And keep so free from crime:
That not so much as one of them
Shall break at any time.
Misfortune or ill hap,
The wicked men shall kill,
And such as do the just men hate,
Shall peryshe in their ill.
The Lord will save the souls
Of all that do him serve,
And all that put their trust in him
Shall not in peril swerue.
An example that God hears all such prayers as are made with a faithful
heart, out of the.liiii. Psalm.
EVery good phisicien,
That does a medcyne prove
To take effect in curyng well,
Is stricken straight with love,
Not only to give god the praise
For his virtue and grace:
But does the same in writing put,
To comfort all his race.
That all which after follow him
In that most godly art,
May prove the like and praise the lord
In like case for their part.
Noble king David in such wise
Does godly jove bestow,
By writing medcines for the soul,
That other men may know.
As if they doubt at any time
How he did health obtain,
He did the same declare abroad
In writing to remain:
That when to others like distres
Here after may betyde,
With clean hearts that they may prepare,
And like medcines provide.
But I will never teach (quod he)
In dark or doubtful way,
But such as I in practice did
By perfect proof assaye:
And of my self probatum est,
Such medicines I bring:
And in example to you all
In this wise will I sing.
Deus in nomine tuo.
O God I call to thee for help
In my distress and need
For thy names sake, and in thy stre^gthe,
Avenge my cause with speed.
For strangers full of tyranny
Against me rise and rave:
Such folly she folk as fear not God
Do seek my life to have.
But lo God is my help at need,
Yea only it is he,
That does my soul uphold and save,
From their iniquitee.
And evil shall the lord reward
Upon mine enemies,
And in his truth destroy them all
That virtue do despise.
With offrynges of an heart most free,
Now will I praise thy name:
Because O lord my comfort sty^^
Consists in the same.
For thou lord did delyuet me,
From troubles manyfolde:
So that upon my foes mine eye
Does his desire behold.
For this to give glory to god
Shall be my hearts delyght,
To the father, and to the son,
And to the holy sprite:
As it from the beginning was.
And at this time is sure,
And as it shall world without end
Continue and endure.
An example that the thankful age gave praise to god, for all his benefits
given to his creatures, out of the lxv. Psalm of David.
I Herd a preacher once declare,
Two parts to be in prayre,
The one to god in all our need
For succor to repair,
And ask of him with steadfast says
All whereof we have need:
For Christ has surely promised,
That thereof we shall speed.
The second part of perfect prayre
Is geuyng thanks and praise,
To God for all his benefits.
That we receive always.
This is the lyvly sacrifice,
The living God to please:
As prayer of the penitent,
His anger does appease.
And sure (quod he) the very cause
That god often will not here,
Is that men for his benefits
Unthankful do appear.
For when we pray in time of ned^
For plenty of our food,
How can we think that God to us
Will give ought that is good?
If we in time of plenty be
Unthankful and ingrate,
To give him praise and honor both,
According to the rate?
Yea I may also farther say,
This living without awe,
Ingratitude does cause the lord
His goodness to withdraw.
And surely David in this Psalm
Likewise does well declare,
That to praise God we never should
Any time cease or spare.
But for the goodness which god does
On mortal men bestow,
In praise of his most holy name,
Some thankful psalm to show.
How men shall with a faithful hart^
Gods holy name agnise,
He does instruct all Christen men
By synging in this wise.
Te decet hymnus deus in Sion.
TO the O god in Sion still
Great praises are in store:
To the also they vow and, kep^
Their promise ever more.
My prayer lord sith thou do hear^,
And art my whole comfort:
All flesh to the for succor shall
In their due time resort.
My misdeeds and my wickedness
Against me does prevail,
Oh to my sins be merciful,
That thus do me asayle.
For they are blessed whom thou do chose,
And in thy house retain:
Or doste elect, within thy court
To dwell and to remain.
For he shall lead a pleasant life
Within thy holy place:
Thy temple shall him satisfy
With goodness and with grace.
For wonders great thou do declare
In truth to teach us right:
O god of our salvation
In the is our delyghte.
Of all things how thou art the hope
It can not be discuste:
All that on earth or sea remain,
In the do hope and trust.
Thou gyrded haste thy self also,
With mighty strength and power,
And have the mighty mountains setts
As they stand at this hour.
Thou of the sea stillest the waves,
Their roryng and their rage,
The madness of the multitude
Thou also can aswage.
The outmoste dwellers on this earth,
Thy signs do see and fear:
By the morning and euenyng stars,
Thy praises do appear.
The earth eke how thou visitest
With good it for to bless,
And bryngest plenty on the same,
We knowledge and confess.
For the river of god does flow
So full of water pure,
That on the earth plenty of corn
For man he does procure.
The forowes he does water so
That clotts do break in piece,
Sweet drops of rain does soften them,
And causeful great increce.
The year thus does he crown and bless
With plenty and goodness,
The clouds do drop great fatnes down
Ingendring plentiousnes,
The dwellinges in the wyldernes
Are fat in like manner:
The little hills on every side
Do plesantly appear.
The fouldes with sheep, y^ vales with corn,
So ratefie this thing:
That in thy praise for very joy,
All people laughe and sing.
An example how happy and blessed they are that faithfully fear god, out of
the.Cxii. Psalm.
SVche good historiographers
As write the deeds of men,
Of kings and lords, some good some ill,
That reigned now and then:
As they do write of evil men
In rebuke and disprayse,
That living men may learn to flee
And void such wicked ways.
So do they praise and much commend
Such men as lived well,
The worthy and the noble acts
Wherein in they did excel.
That others they might so provoke
To follow in like wise,
To win the spurs of godly fame
By virtues exercise.
So David to provoke all men
To godlynes and grace,
Does use the like, that all men may
The fear of god embrace.
In faith how that the fear of god
All goodness still does bring,
He used in an holy Psalm
In this wise for to sing.
Beatus vir qui timet.
THe man is blessed and happy which
Does fear the Lord aryght,
And to keep his commandments,
Does set his whole delyght.
His stre^ne or sede upon the earth
With might shall be increste,
Thus shall the kind of faithful men
Eternally be bleste.
For riches joy and plenty great
His house shall win and gain,
His just dealyng and ryghteousnes
For ever shall remain.
For to the godly in darkness
great light there does arise:
Which shows love and mercy both
In virtuous exercise.
A good man sure is merci^ull
And lends where is need,
And does discretly way his worde^*
Before they do proceed.
And such a man for no distres
From god will move or flee:
Wherefore his ryghteousnes shall have
Eternal memory.
Of ill tyd ynges or heavy news,
Such one is not afraid:
His heart does stand fast and believe,
The lord to be his aid.
His heart I say is stablyshed,
And will not shrynke, until
That he upon his enemies
Has his desire and will.
He from his store abundantlye
Disperseth to the poor:
For righteousness are all his works
And doings ever more.
With honor shall his horn or strength
Exaited be on hye:
Which when the ungodly behold,
They will the same envy
Which in their hate shall gnash their teeth
And so consume away:
Thus in their own lust wicked folk
Shall peryshe and decay.
An example of the praise of God, for his omnipotency. out of the, Cxiii.
Psalm.
King David knowing well,
How virtue did excel
All other worldly thing:
Did chiefly in Gods fear,
All wyckednes forbear,
That may gods anger bring.
For god is of such power,
That nothing at no hour
Can him withstand or bide:
For he may work his will
All mortal men until,
At every time and tide.
Therefore we are al bownde,
That dwell in this world round,
To praise the living lord:
And in that lord of might
To set our whole delight,
And in his holy word.
Wherefore this noble king
Studied above all thing
His duty to walk in,
To sing Gods laud and praise,
He makes no delays,
But thus he does begin.
Laudate pueri dominum.
YE servants praise the lord,
And with hartye accord
Se that ye do the same:
Look that ye render store
Of praises ever more,
Unto his blessed name.
His name that we should praise
He is worthy alwayse,
Even from the rising time
Of the son fair and bright:
Until it be in sight,
That down he does inclyne.
The lord is hie of might,
There is no kind of wight,
That can with him compare:
His gloris certainly
Above the heavens hye
Remain and ever are.
Who is like unto him,
Or will presume to clymme
Where he so high does dwell?
Yet is this lord so meke,
To behold and take keep
Of earth and heaven well:
Who does the simple take
Out of the myery lake,
To set them up again:
He takes out of the dust
All that in him do trust,
To ryd them from their pain.
So that he may them set
Among the princes great,
By his great power and might:
The princes all among,
Which govern do the thronge
Of people day and night.
He does redeem also
The woman from her woe,
That barayne long has been:
A mother full of blys
Of children now she is,
Her household may be seen.
An example how David praised God, for his delyueryng of Israel, by great
miracles, out of Egypt. Out of the.C. xiiii. Psalm.
Who so in Exodus will read,
Shall see what wonders god there wrought:
From Egypt when as he did lead
His people, and from thence them brought.
What miracles by Moses hand,
To Pharao was expressed plain:
That he thereby might understand,
No more gods people to restrain.
And how God by his mighty power
And stretched arm did bring them thence:
And how the red s^a did devour
King Pharao for his recompense.
And how God did in wyldernes,
Provide his people drink and meat:
So that they lackte in their distres,
No kind o^ thing to drink or eat.
Which David bearyng well in mind
Did with a Psalm give god the praise:
And does thereto all good men bind,
With godly heart lo thus he says.
In exitu Israel de Egypto.
FRom Egipte land when Israel,
(where they long time wear thraule and bond)
From among people strange and fell.
When Judah began to escape the hand:
This Judah then I say was made
His holy people and his flock,
And Israel was in like trade
Becomde his lordship all the stock.
Which when the ragyng sea beheld,
It fl^d as one should it desire:
And Jordan ^^ like case did yield,
And backwarde did turn, and retire.
The mountains at the sight of this,
Could not be still but skipte like ramines:
The little hills eke would not mis,
But leaped like the playing lamines.
If one might ask what ayled thee
Thou sea, that thou dydest so forbear?
And Jordan what cause might there be,
That drove the back in such a fear:
Ye mighty mountains in like case,
Why skipped you like rams I say?
Ye little hills, why from your place
^an ye to leap as lammes do play?
All the whole earth it shall behoue,
When Jacobs God shall be present,
To tremble shake and much to move,
And in his sight him reverent.
For at his will he turned tho
The hard rock in to water clear,
Conuertyng hard flynte stones also
To springyng wells as did appear.
An example of prayer against idolatrous tyra^tes, that set up false worship,
in the reproach of Gods true worship. Out of the.Cxv. Psalm.
IF unto us poor mortal men
No praise is due of very right,
How are they mockte and blinded then,
How far are they from perfect sight?
That to a stock or dead Image
Will give such laud as god should have?
How vain is he how does he rage
That does Gods glory so deprave?
The which sin and most vile offense.
David did so abhor and hate,
That he a Psalm in Gods defense
Compiled has: that each estate
May understand how far awrye
They wandered be from righteousness,
The living God that do deny,
By an Image or false lykenes.
And therefore does all men exhort
To fear^ the lord and in him trust:
Which is a true and sure comfort
To all that in his hope are just.
His harp in hand he therefore took,
And on his knees this noble king
(As it is in the Psalter book)
This holy Psalm began to sing.
Non nobis Domine.
NOt unto us lord, not to us
But to thy holy name alwayse,
For thy mercy and truth done thus,
Ascribed be all laud and praise.
These heathen folk that faythles be,
Why should they say to us in spighte?
Where is their God let us him see,
In whom these Christians have delyghte
For their false Gods their chief and best,
Are nothing but silver and goulde:
The hands of men both most and lest,
Have forged them out of the moulde.
Yet have they for their idols made
Mouths, wherwt they can speak nothing
And eyes also whereof the trade,
Is to be blind from all seeing.
Such ears also in them are wrought
As hear nothing that one can tell:
And noses which are likewise naught,
For they with them can nothing smell.
Vain hands have they and fete also,
For with their hands they handle not:
Nor with their feet they can not go,
Nor sound no voice out of their throat.
Wherefore such as do Idols make,
Do their own works resemble just,
And they also that do them take
For Gods, or have in them their trust.
Let Israel then in the lord
Set all their trust and confidence:
And Araons house thereto accord
For he is their most sure defense.
All ye that fear the lord aright,
Trust in him well be not afraid:
For he will surely show his might
To succoure you and be your aid.
The lord will not forget doubtless,
But have us in his mind full well,
The ryghteous houses he will bles
Of Araon and of Israel.
Ye that do fear the lord therefore,
Are blessed both the great and small:
The lord increase you more and more,
Both you and eke your children all.
For sith ye are his chosen sort,
And have the lord whole in your thought,
He will you bless with great comfort,
Both heaven and earth that made of naught.
The heavens and the firmament
Are his and at his holy will:
But the round earth he has forth lent
The sons of mortal men until.
The dead O lord that are gone hence
Can not in grave express thy ways:
Nor such as down are in silence,
Can honor thee or give the praise.
But we O lord that be alive
Thy praise will spread and ramifye,
And in our hearts due thanks contryue
Unto thy name eternally.
An example of prayer from a repentant heart out of the.Cxxx. psalm.
Sithe in this world all men do fall
And none from sin is free and clear:
It does behoue we study all,
In humblenes for to appear.
For in this life we daily see,
By stoutnes none can win nor gain,
But rather it in each degree
Does purchase woe and cruel pain.
Who is so fond if he offend,
To stand him self to justify?
And rather does not knele and bend
Till he have pardon and mercy?
The noble prince David therefore,
Knowing the fruits of humblenes:
Did from his heart power forth great store,
Of tears and contrite gentilnes.
Because he would all men should learn
The like to do in their great need:
He shows how his heart did yerne,
Till he had felt mercy in deed.
Him self prostrating in due wise
For sorrow of his grievous sin,
In prayer was his exercise:
Thus does his humble suit begin.
De profundis clamaui.
FRom care of heart that cave so deep,
So has my soul my sins abhorde:
Repentantly I humbly crepe,
And call to thee for help O lord.
O lord witsafe my voice to here,
I thee beseech to bow thine ears.
Suffer my prayer to appear,
Pourde forth to thee with piteous tears.
For if thou wylt for evermore
Our wyckednes lay by thy side,
Or keep a note of them in store:
Oh lord who then may (...) abide.
Thy mercy lord then make us taste,
Which is to thee most natural:
That graciously forgive thou may,
And raise them which by frailty fall.
This made me on the lord to wait,
My soul also on him to bide:
His promise is without deceyte,
And from his word he will not slide.
My soul has more earnest delyghte
Upon the lord to watch and stay,
Than watchmen, which wake al ye night
And long right sore till it be day.
Let Israel the Lords elect,
(The just that godly be and wise,)
Have to the lord their whole respect:
For mercy is his exercise.
This Israel I say he shall,
All wickedness from them expel,
From sins he shall redeem them all,
Though they be more then tongue can tell.
Glory be to our god above,
The father which of might is most,
And to the son as does behoue,
And also to the holy ghost:
As it from the beginning was,
And yet does to this time extend,
And shall be still as time shall pas
For ever more world without end.
An example that as well penitent prayer, as joyful thanks and praise, have
their due time and place, out of the.Cxxxvii. Psalm.
AS each thing has his due time her^,
On this earth where we go:
So is there time for joy and glee,
And eke for care and woe.
For as we joy in time of wealth,
Praising the lord therefore:
So in the time of pensyvnes,
Of mirth we make no store.
In one subject two contraries
Can never well agree:
Both mirth and woe at once in one
A strange thing were to see.
It would be thought a great madness,
In joy to wayle and wrynge:
Neither can it be coumpted les
In sorrow for to sing.
As when the Jews in Babylon
Where they were captive all,
Commanded were to play and sing,
Of such as made them thrall.
Which vain request of their great foes,
These miserable Jews
Would not accomplish in no wise,
But did the same refuse.
They hangde aside their instruments
And laid their songs away,
And knew it was not time to sing:
But rather for to pray,
That god would them deliver once,
From that their bondage vile:
Wherein they had been punyshed
A long and weary while.
But after three score and ten years,
When God them home had brought,
With holy psalms to praise his name,
They diligently sought.
And in remembrance of the woe,
And bondage, where they were,
And joy of their deliverance,
They song as ye shall here.
Super flumina Babilonis.
ONce as we by the ryuers sat
That run in Babylon,
With bitter tears waylyng our woe,
When we thought on Sion:
We laid a side our thankful tunes,
Of honor laud and praise,
And hung our harpes on wylow trees,
That grew there in those days.
Therefore our foes which to that land
As captives did us bring,
(The more our sorrows to augmente,)
Required us to sing.
Commanding us with spightful scorn
And great derision:
Sing us (quod they) some hebrew songs
Of your blessed Sion.
As though it were convenient
Contrary to gods will,
Such vain precepts of wicked men,
To fellow or fulfill.
In such a land gods laud to singe
With songs of his sweet word:
Where Images the honor have
That due is to the lord.
If ever we Jerusalem
So from our minds consume:
We wysh our right hands might forget
Our harpes to touch in tune.
And that our tongues within our mouth
May cleue we are content,
When we should utter any thing,
That mind may us inuente:
Thy praises oh Jerusalem
If we prefer not still,
Before the most or greatest joy
That hap may us until.
These Edomytes our enemies
Oh lord remember them,
Their wyckednes when they destroyde
Thine own Jerusalem.
Among them selves thus began they say,
Our city to confound:
Destroy and sack it, down with it,
And raze it to the ground,
And thou O daughter Babylon,
(Well worthy of no les)
Thy mirthe shall turn to misery,
And thy joy to distres.
And he shall be a happy man
That with such like again
Shall the reward, as thou did us,
With great reprofe and pain.
Ye blessed shall he be in deed
That shall reward the once,
In taking of thy suckyng babes
And dashe them to the stones.
An example of Gods praise, for his great care over his elect, in disapointing
their enemies and delyueringe them. out of the.Cxl. Psalm.
What can the mortal man
Inuente deuyse or skan,
Against the will of god?
Or how can we withstand,
Of god the heavy hand,
His mighty plague and rod?
What need we then to care,
What wicked men prepare,
With craft us to destroy?
Sithe god the Lord of all,
Can bring us out of thrall,
And turn our care to joy?
The noble king David
The like thing has proved,
That who so fear the lord,
There shall no wight prevail
Though they do us assail:
With works of god abhorde.
For in his time of need
He prayed with all speed,
To god for help and aid:
As it does follow here,
And right well does appear,
What he therein has said.
Eripe me domine.
Deliver me O Lord
According to thy word,
Lord let me not be shent.
On me some pity have,
From subtyle wayghtes me save,
Of enmies violent.
In heart they think myschiefe,
And seek to do me grief:
Their tongues they whet so sharp
As aders venym vile:
That they may us begnyle,
Full wicked wyles they warpe.
Keep me O lord therefore,
From enmies ever more,
Which wicked be and ill:
Thy help let me not want,
For they would me supplante,
From doing of thy will.
These proud men they have set
For me a pryuy net,
Where I should out and in:
Yea and in my pathwaye
My soul for to betraye,
They lay both snare and gyn.
Lord therefore have I said
Thou art mine only aid,
Lord here my deep desire:
O Lord thou art my wealth,
O God my saving health,
Grant me that I require.
Let not these men vnpure
On me take their pleasure,
Distroye their ill intent:
They are so proud and haulte.
That they them selves exalte,
Therefore let them be shente.
I mean such men as be
Of their great subtlety,
At no time vnpreparde:
Lord in their own deceyte,
Wherewith they laid such weyke,
(...) their own fete be snarde.
Let coals of fire fall down,
And cast them on their crown,
And throw them into hell
From whence how for to rise
There is no tongue so wise,
That can them read or tell.
Let nothing prosper well
On earth where such men dwell,
Reprove their rich renown:
To mischief they be wunte.
With plages therefore them hunte
And hedlong throw them down.
I know the lord will wound,
And viterly confound,
All men to pride adicte:
And will avenge in deed
The poor that stand in need,
And are thus sore afflicte.
The ryghteous verily
Shall praise and magnify
Thy holy name therefore:
The hearts of pure pretense,
Shall dwell in thy presence,
Good lord for ever more.
An example how to praise God for his almighty power, and gentylnes. Out of
the.Cxlv. Psalm.
AS he that would set forth to men,
The praise of some good king,
To cause his subiec tes him to love:
And obey in all thing,
Does show to them his great goodness,
His power and all his might
That thereby he may cause all folk,
In him to have delyght:
And also that his enemies
The more may stand in fear,
And where perhaps they would rebel
To cause them to forbear:
So David does gods glory show,
And power omnipente,
To make hard hearts that fear not god,
To soften and relente.
That they might come in unity
Of God and of his law,
And leaves no good means unsought,
Them to intyse and draw.
That uniformly mortal men,
Which in this world do dwell:
Might all agree praysinge the lord,
And in virtue excel.
Which if ye stay or stand in doubt
How to begin this game,
Take here a Psalm, which will instruct
And lead you in the same:
Exaltabo te deus.
O God that art mine only king,
I will thee magnify:
and so set forth thy laud and praise
To dure eternally.
From day to day even every day,
Great thanks I will thee give,
And praise thy name for ever more,
While I have time to live.
Great is the Lord and meruaylous,
And worthy of all praise:
There is no end of his greatness,
Or magnificent ways.
From time to time for ever more
Each generation
To others shall thy power declare,
And thy works evry one.
And as for me mine only talk
Shall worship still thy name,
Thy glory and thy wondrous works,
And praise the for the same.
Men of thy works so meruaylous
To speak shall have delyght:
And always shall be talkyng of
Thy greatness and thy might.
Of thine abundant kyndnes we
Will keep memorial,
And sing of thy great ryghteousnes
From henceforth all men shall.
For thou O lord art gracious
Yea merciful and meke,
Long suffering and of great goodness
To them that do him seek.
To every man lyberally,
The lord does show his love,
And over all his goodly works,
His mercy still does move.
And they express thy glory great,
Thy kyngoome and thy power:
To men that all these might be known
At every time and hour,
Thy kingdom everlastingly
A kingdom is right sure,
Thy lordshyp shall from age to age
Eternaly endure.
For in his deeds he faithful is,
(What so he take in hand)
His works he all holy and just,
Both upon sea and land.
The lord vpholdeth all that are
In danger for to fall,
Them that be down he lyfteth up
When they on him do call.
The eyes of all on thee O lord
Do wait and put their trust,
And thou do give to them their meat
In season due and just.
Thou openest thy holy hand,
Thy power and thy good will,
All living things plentifully,
Therewith that thou may fill.
The lord is righteous in his ways,
His works be holy all:
And he is nyghe to faithful men,
When they on him do call:
Such as fear him, he will fulfill
To them their whole desire.
He will them here and help also
When they do him require.
All such as love and fear the Lord,
Them still preserves he:
And he will scatter all abroad
Such as ungodly be.
My mouth shall speak and praise ye lord
And that abundantly,
Let all flesh thank his holy name
With laud eternally.
The nynth chapter of Ecclesiasticus: or book of Jesus the son of Sirach.
The argument
^ OF iclousie who so will hear,
^ unto my tune hark and draw nere,
^ how ye shall ofthe harlottes vile
^ esch^^^ the sleyght the fraud and guile.
What mischief and what hurt they do
To such as harken them unto,
How vain and vile adultrie is
How fond they are that walk amys.
How we should keep, an old friend true
And never change him for no new,
How for to lead a godly life,
In holiness without all strife.
How that a king by wysdomes lore
Should rule and govern evermore,
How each man should in his degree
Se that his work well used be.
And how the folysh talkatyue
Are the most wicked folk on live,
To Jesus Sirach give good ear
Which tells his tale in this manner.
Ecclesiast. Cap. ix.
BE not over thy wife Jealous,
but without strife keep well thy house:
Lest that she show some point of ill,
Or wicked slight the for to spyll.
Nor tangle not thy power nor life:
With a false whore which makes strife:
Lest she redounde within thy strength,
And so confound thy soul at length.
Behold not women vain and naught,
Which upon men set all their thought:
On such I say set not thy care,
Lest they betray thee in their snare.
Abstain and flee her wicked way,
That loves to geste scoff dance and play,
To her consent not in no wise,
Though she the tempte and often entyse.
Look not to long upon a maid,
Least with her form thou be dismayde.
Much less on harlotes then have mind
Nor on women of such ill kind:
Least thou decay before thine age,
And so consume thine heritage.
In towns and cities do not gase,
As one whose wits were in amase:
Nor wander not in every street,
Least with ill men perhaps thou mete.
Chiefly of all turn thy face fro,
The woman gaye which works woe.
Behold not much the great beauty,
Of any one unknown to thee:
For in time past such fools have been,
Which with their fond eyes as I wene*
Did so regard the beuty fair
Of strangers where they did repair:
That they decayed through their desire,
Which burned like the flaming fire.
Wherefore women adulterous,
Should only be regarded thus,
As most vile dounge durte mire and claye,
That each man treads on in his way.
For such as on them wonder had,
Were by their beutie tangled mad.
All wysdom they from them did cast:
So whot of fond love was the blast.
Lead thou therefore a godly life:
Covet thou not thy neighbors wife.
Sit not with her at any sted:
Lie not with her upon a bed.
No talk with her make thou at wyne^
Least thy heart should to her inclyne.
Thereby making thy blood to fall:
And so destroy thy life and all.
Forsake not thou a good old friend:
For such a new is hard to find.
For a new friend is like new wine:
Which is not good till it be fine.
But when the wine is old and pure,
Then may y^ drink him with pleasure,
Desire not the honor therefore,
That synn^rs gain and keep in store.
If thou dydst their destruction know,
Which will them once all ouerflowe:
To such honor thou would not haste.
Nor of their vain wealth wysh to taste.
Of one thing more warn thee I will,
Abstain from such, whose power may kill.
For if with such thou make strife,
He may sone take from thee thy life.
Forsee and shurne each casualtie:
So shall thou escape all ieopardie.
Take good head of an ill neighbor,
Least with some craft he thee devour.
With wise men be in company,
So shall thou gain great honesty.
Let just men be thy gestes always,
Joy in gods name and give him praise.
Be courteous gentle, good and kind,
Have gods fear ever in thy mind.
Let all thy works and talk be bent,
Upon the lords commandment.
Each good crafts man should set his will
His work to frame by discrete skyll.
Which being set before men's eyes,
Shall cause him to be counted wise.
For each work brought to gorgeous end,
Does cause all men it to commend,
A prince that rightly govern will,
Like wise of wisdom should have skyll.
So well he should wysdom decerne,
That at his talk others might learn.
Him that does many fond words use,
A wise man's part is to refuse.
For such in town and in city.
Do kyndle strife and vylainy,
They neither weye cause, time, nor place:
In them is neither wytie nor grace.
They are past shame I say, therefore
Refuse such men and them abhor.
The manner of true and perfect prayer instituted by our savior Jesus Christ,
the only son of God, the wisdom of the father, and second person in trinity.
^ THe syxt of mathewe if ye read
^ example ye may find.
^ What prayer is and how to use
^ the same in perfect kind.
For Christ our only mercy seat,
So soundly has us taught,
That in his gospel we may find,
Not else where to be sought.
When thou doste pray says Christ our Lord
Se that thou do refuse,
The vain glory that hippocrites
Do in their prayers use.
For they will in the synagoges,
Their prayers to appear,
In open streets or in such place,
As most men may them here.
For which their folysh vaynglorie,
That would of men be heard,
The praise of men which they desire,
Is only their reward.
But at such time as thou wylt pray,
Into thy chamber go,
A faithful and a contrite heart
Prayer must Issue fro.
And when thou have closed thy door,
And shut out wordly care,
And vayn thoughts of this wretched world
Thy prayer then declare.
Unto thy god and father dear,
Which is in secret still:
Seeing the bothom of each heart,
Each thought, each work and will.
Who will reward thee in such wise
That it shall well appear,
That he has heard thy hearts request,
Most like a father dear.
But in thy prayer babble not
With many words and vain,
As Heathen men which think thereby
their purpose to obtain.
It is the heart and not the lyppes
Whereby thou may aspyre,
Thy suit to god for to attain,
And to have thy desire:
The heart I say both clean and pure
Must be the very mean,
For lips do but provoke gods wrath
Where hearts be found unclean.
For god does know before you speak^
Your need and all your lack,
And will you keep it you be just,
That naught shall go to wrack.
And err thou pray bethynke thy self,
Who did the hurt or grieve,
Refrain thy wrath in continent
And louyngly forgive
If thou forgive not other men,
Their trespasses and crime,
Think not that god will thee forgive,
Thy faults at any time.
Contrariwyse if thou forgive,
Such as did the unright,
God by his promis will thee here
And show the mercy bright.
And where thou have done any hurt,
It is not worth the while
To pray before thou make amends,
And thy self reconcyle.
But when thou art prepared thus,
In all points as I say:
With pure heart in most humble wise.
On this sort see thou pray.
Pater noster.
O Lord that art our only god
And father of us all,
In heaven which art resident,
To thee we cry and call.
Thy holy and thy blessed name,
That we may sanctify:
Grant that we may for ever use
The same reuer ently.
Oh let thy kingdom down descend,
And always us protecte:
That we may reign in peace and joy
Which are thine own elect.
Thy worthy will let it be done
Of worldly wretches here:
As it in heaven ever is
Among thy saints most dear.
Our daily bread give us this day,
Our bodies to sustain:
And to our souls thy blessed word,
Thy truth still to mainteyne.
Both for the body and the soul,
Relieve us with thy store:
That we thereby may taste thy grace,
This day and ever more.
Our trespasses and our great sins,
Redeem and clean forgive,
As we forgive and mercy take,
On them that do us grieve.
O lord into temptation
Above our strength and power,
Do not lead us at any time,
Least Satan us deuowre.
But with thy grace defend us still,
Let not thy goodness cease:
But from all euylles us defend,
Deliver and release.
For only to thee does belong
The kingdom very right,
The power and glorious majesty,
For ever so be it.
The abridgement of our Christen belief, written as some suppose into.xii.
Articles, by the.xii. holy apostels of our savior Jesus Christ.
THe.xii. Apostelles of Jesus our lord,
After their holy preaching a long time,
And setting forth of gods most holy word,
Preaching repentance from al sin and crime
Yet not withstandinge all their dilygence,
Mistaking of gods word did make offense.
For many heresies did then arise,
And mysbele^e in god our lord above,
By mystakyng, and worldely wit like wise,
Which made from true faith many to remove.
For carnal reason walks still astray,
And unto faith does always disobay.
These holy preachers therefore thinkinge best
In this turmoyle to set order and stay,
Did then deuyse both unto most and least,
Of true belief a brief and perfect way,
That all men might, as well the young as o^lde.
Sone learn the same and in memory houlde.
Sith then the holy ghost has taught us thus,
It does behoue that we dilygently,
Do learn the same to know and to discuss,
And keep each part thereof most faithful,
Wherefore the sum of it I will rehearse
As here does follow in this kind of verse.
Credo in deum patrem.
I Do believe with steadfast true intent
In God the father which is of all might,
Who made heaven earth and al their whole content
The night the day the darkness and the light.
And I believe in Jesus Christ our lord.
His only son thee uerlastyng word.
Which of the holy ghost conceived was,
And of the most pure virgyn Mary borne,
And under Ponce Pylat as came to pass
Suffered, and on the cross was rent and torn.
And being dead, was buried in the end,
And also down into hell did descend.
And the third day according to scripture.
He rose from death to perfect life again:
And up to heaven he ascended sure,
On god the fathers right hand to remain:
Till at the last he once again shall come,
Both quick and dead to judge by rightful dome.
I also believe in the holy ghost,
And in the church of christ catholycall,
And of the saints the communion most,
The forgeuenes of mine offenses all,
And this our flesh shall rise again at last.
And I believe eternal life to taste.
Amen.

our lord and savior Jesus Christ, after the salutation of the Angel
Gabriell, and of Elizabeth mother of blessed John baptist. written. Luke the j.
Chapter.
Magnificat anima mea.
My soul truly
Shall magnifye
The lord, and him honor:
So shall my sprite
Joy and delyghte
In god my savior.
His eyes he stayed
On his handmayde,
In poor and low degree,
And kinreds all
From henceforth shall
Know me blessed to be.
For he whose might
Excels right
Has exalted my ^ame:
Doing to me
Great things and hye,
And holy is is name.
His mercy sure
Does aye endure,
And does not wast nor wear:
In kynredes all
Continual
That do him love and fear,
He in his power,
Has at this hour
His arm put forth at length:
The proud abowght
Brings to nowght,
What so their hearts inuenth.
He puts down
From their renown
The mighty and the strong:
And does up set
In honor great
The meek that suffer wrong.
And he does still
Both feed and fill
All those that hunger pain:
And does them good
When without food
The rich empty remain.
He has in mind
His mercy kind,
His folk to help and save:
His servants well
Even Israel,
That for his mercy crave.
As he like wise
Did once promise,
To Abraham before:
Our fathers old
that faith did hold,
And their sede evermore.
Glory and praise
And laud always.
Unto the trynitie:
With one accord
Praise we the lord
One god and persons three.
As has been aye,
And at this day
Continues as yet:
And shall extend
World without end,
For ever so be it.

The r. commandments of almighty God written, in ij. tables of stone with y^

the v. Chapter Deuteronomium.
Argument.
The living God our only Lord
That all things with his word has made,
And (as the scripture does record)
Does govern all in godly trade,
And knowth how apt man is to stray
And all good things to disobay.
With his finger (for man's behoue)
In tables twain of stone did write
Commandments ten, his heart to move
From guyle and wrong to truth and right:
In godlynes to guide his ways
They follow here note what he says.
I Am thy Lord and God alone
From Egypt land that* brought the right.
Beholding thy distress and moan:
From house of bond I freede thee quight.
Wherefore thou shalt I say to thee
None other Gods have before me.
Thou shall no graven Image make,
Nor picture be it great or small,
Or figure that thy mind may take,
In heaven earth or waters all:
Nor honor them, that shall not thou,
Nor unto them ne knele nor bow.
For I thy God and only Lord
A jealous God am of such sin,
And fathers faults I have abhorde
Upon their childern and their kynne:
In kynreds iij. or iiij. or mo
I vysit them that hate me so.
Which justice yet does me not stay
From mekenes, mercy, nor from grace:
Which I extend to them always
My holy laws that do embrace:
To thousands though none can deserve,
That I command if they observe,
The holy name thou shall not use
Of me thy lord and God in vain,
Unlawful oaths thou shall refuse,
Swear not for false or fylthy gain:
The Lord will thee not hold vngylt
His name in vain if take thou will.
Remember that in any wise
the Sabbath day thou sanctify,
Syx days thou shall thee exercise,
And labor for necessity:
The seventh day the Sabbath is
Of god almyght the lord of blys.
Therefore this day bear well in mind
No kind of work that then thou do,
Unto which law thy son I bind,
Thy daughter shall it keep also,
Thy man thy maid and eke thy beast:
In fine within thy gate thy geast.
For in syx days the lord created
Heaven, earth, sea, and all of naught,
The seventh day take his rest he did:
Wherefore the lord that all has wrought,
The Sabbath day did sanctify,
And blessed it perpetually.
Thy father and thy mother dear
Se that thou reverently honor,
Let none ingratitude appear
In thee to them, but them soccour:
So in the land long shall thou live,
Which thy lord God to thee shall give.
Thou shall not kill note thou it well.
Also thou shall no wedlock break.
I say also thou shall not steal.
Nor witness false thou shall none speak.
Against thy neighbors, them to wrong:
But live uprightly them among.
And to conclude of this take heed
What my laws chieflye do require,
Not only to forbere the deed,
But also from the hearts desire,
Of that thy neighbor does possess,
Of any thing in more or less.
Particularlye to recite,
Thy neighbors house covet thou not:
Nor yet his wife, his hearts delyght,
His man or maid which is his lot:
His ox or ass or ought of his,
Covet thou not, think well on this.
The praise of God the father son and holy ghost. Written in an holy Hymn,
by the worthy fathers Augustine and Ambrose.
Te Deum laudamus.
O God of might
As it is right
We yield the land and praise.
With one accord
To be the Lord
We knoweledge thee alwayse:
The earth throughout
And all about
Thy worship does express:
Thou do appear
A father dear
In euerlastyngnesse.
To thee do call
The Angels all
And cry with a loud dynne:
The heavens hye
Eternallye
And all the powers therein.
Both Cherubin
And Ceraphin
Do in thy praise rejoice:
And thus always
Express thy praise
With an incessant voice.
Holy, holy,
Thou art holy,
Lord God of Sabbath:
Thy majesty
And thy glory
Fylles heaven and earth both.
The glorious sect
Of thine elect
Apostles every one:
Thy praise does show,
All in a row
And honor thee alone.
The Prophets all
Do on the call
So goodly in their kind:
That fellow ship
Does not let slyppe
To keep thy praise in mind.
The noble array
Of martyrs aye
Thy praise does still express:
The Church holy
Where ever it be
The like praise does confess.
Infinitlye
Thy majesty
O father does endure:
And thy Son still
We honor will,
Only so true and pure.
The holy ghost
Our comfort most,
We do confess to be:
Thou Christ Jesus,
Mesias true
Art the king of glory.
Thou art ever
Of the father
The everlasting son:
Which we confess
Both more and less
That in this world do won.
When for our sake
Thou dyddest take
On thee man to restore:
The womb so cleene
Of the Virgin
Thou dyddest not abhor.
When thou the darte
Of death so sharp
Dydst vanquishe and deprive:
Thou dydst unloose
Thy bless, to those
That truly d^ believe.
On the right hand
(We understand)
Of the father so dear,
(In glory great)
There art thou set
Till the last day appear.
Then we believe
Judgment to give,
That thou from thence shall come,
Most ryghteouslye
Our judge to be
And judge us all and some.
Thy servants pray
Thee day by day,
Of thee some help to have:
Whom with thy blood
Precious and good,
Thou dydst redeem and save.
Make them indede
To be numbered
With thy holy saints all:
For evermore
Thy face before
In glory eternal.
Thy people save.
Which on the crave:
And bless thine heritage,
Govern them still,
To do thy will,
Ever from age to age.
For we daily,
Thee magnify
And worship still thy nam^
And still intend
World without end,
To continue the same.
Vouchsafe we pray
O lord this day,
From sin us to defend:
For on thine aid
Our faith is stayde,
And ever does depend.
Mercy O lord,
Have mercy Lord,
Show us thy mercy just:
On us let light
Thy mercy bright,
As we in thee do trust.
And since always
My trust and stay,
In the lord is fyxed:
Oh grant that I
Eternally
Be never confounded.
To the father,
And his son dear,
And to the holy ghost,
Glory and praise
Give we always,
As we are bounden most.
As was and is,
And shall not mys,
To be each time and when:
For ever more
Laud and honor
To our lord god. Amen.

Worthy to be praised,
Still in worlds all

To set up thy glory.
More then worthy,
Thou art truly
Of laud and praise each day:
Wherefore ever
We will prefer
And set the up for aye.
Blessed alone
In thy high throne
Be thou in thy kingdom:

We still bless shall,
In world of worlds to come.

Set up and it record.

Lyghtnyng and clouds I say:
Let the earth speak
And his praise break

Mountains and hills
With your good wylles,
Herbs, grass, and al grene things
Wells, seas, and flood

And declare his praysyngs.
Ye whales that live
And all that meue,
In floodes and waters clear:
All souls of thayre
Likewise repair,
To make his praise appear.
Bestes and catt^ll

In praise excel
For ever to endure.
With one accord
Praise ye the lord,
That the lords servants are:
Sprites and souls just
His praise sing must
Him set up and declare.
Let holy men
Praise him each when,
And humble men of heart,
With good pretense
Ever from hence,
From his praise never starte.
Ananias
Azarias
And Misaell prefer
His praises great,
And him up set
For ever and ever,
Which has from hell
Us saved well,
And clean delivered:
And has our breath
Kept safe from death,
And also has us ryd.
From burning flame
Amydste the same,
And made the heat retire:
When we did crave,
He did us save
In the mydst of the fire.
Unto the lord
Let us record
Both praise and thanks therefore:
His heart is kind,
For we do find
His mercy evermore.
O all men right
That are contryte,
Speak good and praise the lord,
For he truly
Is almyghtie,
And of all gods the God.
O give him praise
With thanks always,
Whose mercy does extend.
And does endure
Remaining pure,
Ever world without end.
Praise glorious
Ever let us
Magnificently most,
Give the father,
And the son dear
And to the holy ghost.

LEt now thy power be great O lord,
Like as thy lyps did once repeat:
And as we find it in thy word,
Thy suffrance long, thy mercy great.
For as thou doste our sins forgive
And trespasses, when we repent:
So are we sure no man on live
From sin is free and innocent.
And of their father the misdede
Thou visitest upon the child,
His generation and his sede,
In.iiii. degrees therewith defylde.
But now oh lord be gracious
Unto thy flock and their offense:
And of thy mercy bounteous
Remember not our negligence.
Thy people as thou did forbear,
From Egypt into wyldernes,
We the beseech in like manner,
That we may taste thy gentylnes.
ii. Esdras.i.
Sing this as O lord our god we turn to thee. etc.
Lord god that in the heavens hie
Doste keep thy residence:
Thou art a god of terrible
And great magnificence.
Thou that have kept thy covenant
And mercy eke in store,
For them that love thee, and observe
And keep thy holy lore,
Oh let thine ears be attendante,
And mark what I do say:
And let thine eyes be vigilant,
Behold me when I pray.
For I am bent both day and night
To pray before thy face:
That to thy servant Israel
Thou will give health and grace:
And to forgive them all their sin,
That they did thee transgress:
For in the person of them all
Their faults I do confess.
For I my self among them all
Do in the number sit:
My fathers house has not been free
But did like sin commyt.
Corrupted have we been, in that
Thy laws we have not kept:
Thy will and thy commandments
Because we did reiecte.
Yet call to mind thy word O lord
By Moses that was said,
Thy servant whom thou did command
For to proclayme thine aid.
The punishment that thou have made
For our transgressions,
Is for to scatter us a broad
Among the nations.
But thou have said and promised
That if we turn again,
Obseruyng thy commandments
And in thy laws remain:
That though we scattred were abroad
Never so far about,
Yea in the utmost parts of all:
Thou would yet find us out.
And gather us from thence again,
In^o the very place,
That thou us gave to dwell therein
Of thy bounty and grace.
O hear us now thy servants lord
And people of thy land,
That were deliuerd by thy power
And by thy mighty hand.
O lord now let thine ears attend^
To mark what we require:
For thee to serve and fear thy name,
Is now our whole desire.
Tobias.xiii.
Sing this as The. 6. of Matthew, If ye read. etc.
O Lord our God for ever more
Thy greatness does extend,
Thy power, thy kingdom and thy might
For ever without end.
For after scurges health Insues,
And pleasure after pain:
And unto hell when thou have brought,
Thou bring out again.
Whereby thou have instructed us
That we may understand,
That there is none by any means
That may escape thy hand.
Give thanks therefore unto the lord,
Ye children of the just,
Before the Heathen let his praise
Be showed and discuste.
For therefore has he scatred you,
His wondrous works to show,
Among the Heathen, and the folk
That did him never know.
That they may know and eke confess
That other there is none
That is a god omnipotent,
But our good God alone.
Which has us made for our misdedes
His chastisment to take:
And will us save and help again,
For his own mercies sake.
Then pray to him with fear and dread,
And ponder well this thing:
And magnify in all your works
The everlasting king.
For I will praise him in the land
Of my captivity:
For he did show the sinful folk
His mighty majesty.
O turn you unto God therefore
Ye sinners, and do right,
Ye may be sure with mercy then
That he will you requite.
And as for me, so will I do
In soul and with my voice
For why my god is only he
In whom I will rejoice.
O praise the lord all ye that be
His chosen and elect,
In io^full days give him the thanks
That still does you protecte.
Tobias.iii.
Sing this as the form of perfect prayer beginning, The.vi. of Mathewe.

O Lord god thou art righteous,
Thy judgments all are true:
Thy just ways and thy faithfulness
Does mercy still ensue.
Be myndfull now O lord on me,
And plage not for my sin.
Nor have no mind of my misdedes,
Ne of mine elders kynne.
For we to thy commandments
Wear not obedient:
wherefore among all nations,
Thou have us captive sent.
And scattred haste us them among,
That daily us deryde:
For dreadful death, and most vile shame,
Does ever us betyde.
In which thou have declard O lord,
Thy judgments great and hye:
We did not as thou didste command,
Nor walked innocently.
And therefore now O living lord
My prayer shall be still,
That thou command and deal with me
According to thy will.
Receive O lord my sprite in peace,
To thee I do it give:
For it is more expedient
For me do die then live.
Judith. 16.
^ ON tabrets to the lord let us
^ our thankful songs begin,
^ Upon the simbals let us
^ sing a new song unto him.
With joyful thanks his name to praise,
And call upon the same:
It is the lord that wars does cease,
Yea the lord is his name.
Which pitched has his tents of strength
His people all among:
Us to deliver from the hands
Of all our enmies strong.
For from the mountains of the north
Came the Assirian,
And many thousands might we see,
Within his army than.
His multitude had shut the streams
In all our coasts throughout,
And with his horsemen couerd were
The valleys all about.
My marks and bounds he said he would
Consume with burning fire,
To kill my young men with the sword
Was also his desire:
To brain my suckyng babes, and give
Mine infantes for a pray.
My maidens and my virgins pure
He thought to drive away.
But through the lord omnipotent
Such grace we understand,
Of their purpose they are decevd,
Even by a woman's hand.
For with the hands of young me^ strong
He truly was not slain:
Nor they that were of Tytan borne
To kill him took no pain.
Nor giant great: but Indith lo
Daughter of Merari.
For with her face she scattred them
And with her great beutye.
Her wydowes clothes, her morninge wede,
She began the^ to forbear:
And did on such as she was wonie
On holy days to wear.
To help the woeful Israelites,
Whom ieopardie had hent:
Her virtuous face she did anoynte,
With ointment excellent.
And with an houe she trimde her hear,
Her work thus could she weaue:
She ware a ly^nen stole also,
Thus did She him deceive.
Her slypers ravished his eyes,
Her beutie eke his mind:
And through his neck his own sword went
Such end lo did he find.
The Persians wear in doubt and fear
At her audacitie,
The Medes did marvel very much,
Her bouldnes such to be.
The humble folk rejoiced then,
They Ioyde that erste did cry:
And they did fear that bragd before
And feign were now to fly.
Our women's sons then killed them,
Like slaves they ran away:
The servants of the lord my God
Thus caused them to straye.
A song of praise unto the Lord
To sing I will procure:
Thy glory lord and strength also
Invincible and pure.
For each thing y^ thy hand has made
Does serve thee in his kind:
Thou did commau^de and straight it was,
Thy word so strong we find.
Thine holy sprite thou sentest out,
And straight ways it was made:
For nothing can resist thy word,
Which dures and does not fade.
For mountains they shall moved be
With water from their springes,
And in thy sight hard things shall melt,
As wexe and liquid things.
And yet to them that do thee fear
Thy mercy does extend:
From the first time to this present,
And ever without end.
Job.i.
OVt of my mothers womb
All naked came I lo:
And naked shall I turn again,
To earth that I came fro.
The Lord gave at the first,
As his good pleasure was,
And at his will did take again,
As it is come to pas.
The lord his holy name
Be praised now therefore,
As it has been, as it is now,
And shall be evermore.
Proverb. xxx.
^ O Lord two things I the require,
^ that thou me not deny,
^ but that I may the fruit thereof
^ receive before I die.
The first shall be that vanity
Thou will from me restrain,
And eke the lips that lust to lie,
To flatterglose and feign.
The second that thou make me not
To poor in any wise,
Ne yet to rich: but mean living,
Of necessary cyse.
Least when I am to full of wealth
I thee forget and say:
What fellow is the lord? when I
Forgotten have thy way.
And like wise least that poverty
Constrayne me out of frame,
And me provoke to steal O God
And to forswear thy name.
Ecclesiasticus.xxiii.
Sing this as, I am the man whom God. etc.
OH lord I the desire
Of thine abundant grace,
That pride and scornful countenance
Appear not in my face.
Thy goodness now extend,
Oh for thy mercies sake,
Disdeyne and all doluptuousnes
Witsafe from me to take.
The fylthy fleshly lusts
That to our bodies lean,
Destroy thereof the fyery rage,
And make me chaste and clean.
Of pity oh good Lord
Extincte in me this fire:
And let my mind be mundifyd
Of each unclean desire.
Oh leave me not I say
To mine own lust and will:
Thine aid do not from me withdraw,
But be my succor still:
Least wanting of thy help,
I run in error blind:
And fall into vnshamfastnes,
And obstinate of mind.
Oh be thou my fortres,
That I may praise thy name:
So shall I other men exhort
Also to do the same.

Sing this as, I am the man whom^ God. etc.
Unto the gates of hell
I went I should have wend,
Amid my days when as I thought
My years were at an end.
With in my self I said,
I never shall again
Visit the Lord (the lord I say)
In this life while I reign.
I never look again
Before men to appear,
Nor to behold no worldly wyghtes
That have their dwelling hear.
Mine age is folded up
Together at this day:
As one should from the shepeherd poor
His cottage take away.
And through my sins my life
Is cut of and undo,
As when the weuers work is done
His web he cuttes ato.
This pynyng sycknes will
My life in sunder rende,
For in one day I well perceyu^
My life shall have an end.
Until to morrow yet
I thought to live so long:
But he my bones has bruised sor^
Most like a giant strong.
For in one day thou wylt
Mine end bring on me lo:
As swalowes chatter in their lay,
Then began I to do so.
I cried like the crane,
And morned as the dove:
Directyng ever more mine eyes
On hight to him above.
O lord then said I tho
This sycknes does me press:
O ease thou me for in thy power
It is, the same to cease.
What shall I say, the lord
His pro^^s made to me,
And he him self performed has
The same as we may see.
All while I live therefore,
It shall not from my mind,
My bitter life, and how therein
I found him good and kind.
Beyond their years I see
O lord that men may live,
Which I to all men will declare,
And knowledge will them give.
In those prolonged years
How I in joy do reign:
And that thou causedst me to sleep
And gave me lyse again.
My pensi^nes behold,
As bitter was as gall:
And for my health I longed sor^
Out of that woeful thrall.
Thy pleasure was to save
Me from the filthy lake:
For thou O lord have all my sins
Out trowne behind thy back.
For hell geues thee no praise,
Nor death magnificence:
And in their grave none praise thy truth,
That parted be from hence.
The lord has wrought my health,
Our songs we therefore sure
Will always sing within thy house,
While our life days endure.
Jeremy.ix.
Sing this as, I am the man whom God. etc.
O Who will give my head,
Of water perfect store:
And to mine eyes a well of tears
To flow for ever more?
So should mine outward act
Express mine inward pain,
To weep and wayle both night and day,
My people that are slain.
Would God I had elsewhere
A cottage in some place,
That from the people I might be
A far distance and space.
That I might leave my folk
And be from their resort,
Adulterers because they be
And eke a shrynkyng sort.
Like bows they bend their tongues,
Wherewith they shoot out lies:
And grow on earth, for why the world
Does always truth despise.
From wickedness they go
To wickedness again,
And will not know me says the lord,
Nor in my laws remain:
One from an other now
Abstayn and shurnish must:
For no man in his brother may
With saftie put his trust.
Men do their brethern seek,
To wrong and under mind:
Disemblyng still they practice guyle,
No truth in them I find.
Their tongues they exercise,
To lie and eke to feign:
And mischief so they may commyt,
They force not for great pain.
Why do I then remain,
In this despitfull throng?
Which do dissemble, and naught else
But falshod them among.
They will not know the lord,
But wander still awry:
Therefore thus says the lord of hosts,
I will them melte and try.
For what should else be done
To such a people vile:
Whose tongues are like to arowes sharp,
To utter fraud and guyle.
For with their mouths they speak,
As though they meant but peace:
To hurt their neighbor privily
Yet will they never cease.
Should I not punysh them
For this thing (says the lord)
Or should not I aduenged be
Of people so abhorde?
I shall them cause therefore
On mountains to lament:
The deserts and the pleasant playnes
To mourning shall be bent.
For burned shall they be,
Their cattle and their store:
Of bird or beast there shall no voice
Be heard there any more.
Jeremy. 17.
Sing this as, The sixth of Mathewe if ye read. etc.
O Lord I shall be whole in deed,
It I be healed of the:
If thou witsafe now me to save*
Then shall I saved be.
Thou art my prayer and my praise,
I have none other forte:
To give thee thanks for all my help,
To the I must resort.
Behold those men that say to me
In mockage and in scorn,
Where is the word of God say they?
Let it come us beforne.
Though not withstanding when I led,
Thy flock in godly train,
Into thy ways by violence
I did them not constrayne.
Ne yet the death of any man,
I never did desire,
Thou knowste right well that before thee
My tongue was not a liar.
Be not to me to terrible
O lord, but me refrain:
For thou ar^e he in whom I hope
In peril and in pain.
Confound me not, but confound the^
That do my life pursue:
Nor fear me not, but make thou them
To fear and eke to rue.
And power on the^ their painful plague
When thou shall see the time,
And them destroy that have thee done
So detestable crime.
Jeremy.xxxi.
Sing this as On tabrets to the Lord. etc.
O Lord thou have corrected me
For my sinful living,
Though I did as a calf vntame
Receive thy chastening.
Convert me from my sin, and so
Shall I converted be:
Thou art my God and only Lord,
And others none but thee.
So sone as thou have turned me
From sin, I shall return:
Before which time I have no power
My self for to reform.
Which when thou made me perceive
And understand the same:
I smo^e my self upon my thyghe
In my great zeal and shame.
For shamful things sure have I done
Oh let my youth therefore
Confounded be, with his reproof:
For now I them abhor.
Out of the third chapter of Ieremies lamentations.
^ I Am the man whom God
^ in his wrath and fury,
^ has with his rod made right expert,
^ of eury mysery.
He drove and led me forth,
In darkness to endure:
But as for light I might none see,
So wear my ways obscure.
He only against me
Does turn his hand and power,
And laith the same upon me still
At eury time and hour.
My flesh and skyn wax old,
My bones are bruised all:
He builded round, and closde me in,
With travel and with galle.
In darkness he me set
As dead for ever more,
He hedgd me in and fettered me
With heavy linkes and sore.
With clamors pitiously
Though I to him did call,
My prayer and my painful playnt
He hears not at all.
My ways he stopped up
With stones of cubike form:
My paths are made so crokedly,
I not where me to torn.
As does the cruel bear,
Lie waiting for his pray,
And as the lion in his hole
To take me in my way.
He marred has my ways,
In pieces he me brake:
He altogether laid me waste,
And brought me all to wrake.
And when he bente his bow,
He made his mark of me:
The arrows of his quiver ^o
Into my raynes shot he.
I laughed am to scorn,
Of people in the throng:
They make deridyng songs of me,
And mock me all day long.
He fylde my hungry soul,
With bale and bitterness:
And wormwod was my drink also
In my great thyrstynes.
In pieces wear my tethe,
In dust he did me roll.
All good things then I clean forgot,
No rest had my poor soul.
Then in mind I thought
My self undone to be:
For in the lord I see quod I
There is no help for me.
O yet remember then
My misery and woe,
The wormwod and the bitter gall
And my troubles also.
Yea some rememberance
I trust and hope thou have:
For why my soul within me lord
Does melte away and waste.
While I did these things thus
Consider in my heart,
I gat some houlde of hope again
That was so long aparte:
How thy mercies oh lord
Are not gone clean away
And how thy loving kyndnes does
Not cease from us for aye.
My faythfulnes is great,
And ever does renew:
As after the most darkest, night,
The morning does ensue.
The lord quod my soul tho,
He is my portion:
Therefore my faith and perfect hope
Is fix^e on him alone.
O how good is the lord
To them that in him trust?
And to the soul that seeks him
With fervent mind and lust?
Lo then how good it is
Upon the Lord to stay,
And tarry for his saving health,
With stilnes day by day.
How good is it for man,
His yoke on him to take:
And from his youth up wear the same,
Which will him perfect make?
Such one alone will sit
And hold him self right still:
Who by him self will ever dwell,
And quiet be from ill.
Him sclfe he does prostrate,
To hark for hope with love,
And offreth still his cheke, to them
That smite or will reprove.
In hope thus will he rest,
And purely still persevere:
For god the lord will not forsake
His chosen flock for ever.
But though he seem sometime
To cease of for a space:
By multitude of mercies he
Receaues again to grace.
He suffers sons of men
Not from his heart to fleet,
Nor all the prisners on the earth
He treades not under feet.
He does not judgment give
By man's deserts in sight:
And to condemn man in his cause,
The lord has no delyght.
What kind of man is he,
How mad is such a one,
Without the lords commaundment
That says ought may be done?
Out of the holy mouth
Of God the lord most hye,
Both ill and good does not proceed.
What man can this deny?
Why does the living man
Then grudge and murmur so?
At his own sin let him repyne
And so commit no mo.
Behold we our own ways,
And eke bethynke us well,
And turn again unto the lord,
From whom we did rebel.
To heaven let us lift
Our hearts and hands on hye:
And to the Lord that there in is,
On this wise let us cry.
Dissemblers have we been
And did thee sore offend:
O lord let us entreat thee yet,
That thy wrath now: may end.
We hid are in thy wrath
And persecutyng pain,
Without all favor and regard,
O lord thou have us slain.
For in a cloud from us
Thy self thou hydest so,
That through the thicknes of the same
Our prayers can not go.
For outcastes are we now,
The Heathen us despise:
Our enmies all on us they gape,
And mock in sundry wise.
And subjects are we made,
To fear and to the snare:
Destruction on us is come,
And we despised are.
Whole ryuers from mine eyes
Of tears do still increase,
My peoples hurt does cause mine eyes
From weeping not to cease.
For why there is no rest,
O lord consider this:
O when wylt thou from heaven look,
And mende that is amys?
Mine eyes have causde my heart
Insonder for to ryue:
The daughters of my city made,
My woe so to reuyne.
As foulers seek to have
The birds within their paws
Mine enmies sharply hunted me
And that without a cause.
Into a pit most deep
My life put down they have,
Because I should not rise they laid
A stone upon my grave.
They powered water then
Upon my head also:
Now am I quyte and clean undone
To my self thought I tho.
Yet from this pit profounde
I called to the lord,
Which heard my playnt and pit^ous cry,
And has my life restorde.
When I did syghe and cry,
And for redemption pray,
Thou heardst my voice, and turnedst not
Thine ears from me away.
Thy self thou did inclyne,
Thy name when I did call:
And unto me thus have thou said,
Have thou no fear at all.
For thou O lord art he
That did my soul maintain,
And have from death redeemed me
And gavst me life again.
O lord avenge my cause
On them that me blaspheme:
Thou know how they would work me w^
Against me what they mean.
Thou know lord their spyghte,
And all that they invent
Against me what their lyps deuyse,
And their most vile intent.
How they sit down and rise
O lord thou do behold
And how all day in songs on me,
They nothing else but scoulde.
According to their works,
Their reward them disburse:
And give them that their har^es do fear
That is to say thy curse.
O lord persecute them
With indignation,
From under heaven root them out,
And leave of them not one.
Oseas.xiiii.
^ O Lord our God we turn to the,
^ thy word we do embrace:
^ Forgive us our iniquity
^ receive us unto grace.
To offer then in Godly wise
Shall be out whole intent:
Our lyps the lyvly sacrifice
Of praise shall the present.
To man for help and fortitude
We will not seek therefore,
And strength of horse we will conclude
To trust in them no more.
The works eke that our hands did make
That vayn are and must fall,
We do determine to forsake
No more on them to call.
For it is thou that art our God
And ever shall remain:
For mercy at thy fatherhod
The fatherles attain.
O that they would have this remor^^
(Says God) and them convert:
I would them heal of all their sores,
And love them with mine hear^e.
My wrath I would from the^ decline,
To them that I may be
As d^w does make the lylye shine.
So beutifull to se.
Their root like unto Libanus
Shall break out of the ground,
And as the olyfe bewtious
Their branches shall abound.
As Libanus so excellent
Their swetnes shall excel:
Whereof (as all men do assent)
Right pleasant is the smell.
For as the c^rne under that tree
Does flory she well and grow:
So are they shadowed by me
From hurt and overthrow.
And as the growyng of the vine,
So shall they spryng in deed:
Of Libanus as does the wine,
So shall their name excede.
Propose I will this thee unto
O Ephraim therefore:
From henceforth what have I to do
With I dols any more?
I will thee hear and give thee grace
And lead thee forth aryght:
And I will be to thee like as
The grene fyrre tree in syghte.
On me set thy foundation.
Which am to the so kind:
Thy lyvly fruits then evry one
Upon me shall thou find.
This understand the godlywyse
That repe for this reward:
The right instruct will exercise
The same with good regard.
The lord his ways be just and right
The godly walk the same:
The wicked folk do stumble guyte.
And fall out of the frame.
Jonas. Cap. ii.
^ IN my trouble and pain
^ to thee lord I did call,
^ my plaint thou heardest plain,
^ and broughst me out of thrall.
Out of the womb of hell
To the when I did cry,
My voice thou heardest well,
And help me louyngly.
Thou threwst me down as dead
Full deep into the sea,
And made about my head
The floude^ to compass me.
The water waves in haste
Went over me with might:
I thought I had been cast
Away out of thy sight.
But yet again shall I
Go to thy holy place:
Which is thy church holy,
And thank therefore thy grace.
In depnes where I lay,
The water sude my life:
The wedes were wrapte always
About my head with strife.
Into the helles depnes,
Descendyng did persevere,
In woe and great distress
Barde in with earth for ever.
But thou oh God my lord,
Have brough my life again,
And have my soul restorde,
From corruptible pain.
When that my soul did faint
Upon the lord I thought,
My prayer and my playnt,
Was to thy temple brought.
Therefore they that delyght
In vanity so vain,
For sake his help and might
That mercy does retain.
But I will praise and pay
That I him vowed have:
And thank the lord alway^,
That did me help and save.
A consideration of the unrighteous of the vain and miserable world.
Sing this as, Of Ielousy who so will hear.
DIrectly who so now will walk
In paths of plain and perfect way:
whose hearts and mouths together talk
Not glosing by deceit astray.
That flatter none for mede nor love,
Nor ruled by affection,
Nor will for worldly glory move,
Nor yet for brybes infection.
Such me^ had need their countes to cast
In what manner to thrive and gain:
For here let them be sure and fast,
No frendshyp does for such remain*
Requisitly they do regard
The joys laid up in life to come:
And that is only the reward,
Whereon their mind is all and sum.
Wherefore we may with truth conclude,
That such as love this worldly pelf,
From heaven do them selves seclude:
As does that wretch who kylles him self.
And those again that do despise
These mundane gandes, as vile and vain:
May well be called godly wise,
For heavens bliss they shall obtain.
A ditie of lamentation against the dissemblyng and hipocriticall false
dealing, used of most folk in these days: that is to say, holy and honest
talk, myxed with wicked and vicious deeds.
^ IN summer time when flowrs began spryng,
^ and evry bough bent to his kind,
^ Phoebus shone bright the birds did sing,
^ as natures order has assignd:
^ I walked to recreat my mind,
^ which out of sorrow might not starte:
^ but said as duty did me bind,
^ lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
My wits were tossed to and fro,
That truth is preached sincerly,
Yet wicked lyuers never mo
Were in this world right sikarly:
Wherefore I wept full bitterly,
None but God only knew my smarte:
Which me constrained loud to cry,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
None does in his vocation walk,
But each estate wandreth awry:
Yet have the most part godly talk,
And commit deeds clean contrary.
Thus walk they in hypocrisy,
In well doing none does his part:
Wherefore I cryde right heartily
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
The man that is most couetyse
Will talk most against wrongful gain,
Thinkyng by speaking in such wise
His subtle purpose to obtain:
As though perfection did remain
In fla^tring tongues and minds pervert.
This caused me to cry again,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart
How does the rich oppress the poor?
Punyshing them that thereof tell?
How does the wolf the lamb de^oute?
And envy in his venym swell?
How falsely do men buy and sell?
To speak of this it is my part:
For sure these fruits came out of hell,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
In dronkenes they have no pere
That conterfet most sobernes,
Their talk is often chaste and clear
That most frequent lasciuiousnes,
Whordom, adultrye, and excess:
And none can cause them to convert,
Wherefore I cry in heaviness,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
Who reigns now but pride alone?
Each man in his own sight is wise,
And grave council regards none:
But rather does doctrine despise.
Dissimulation and lewd lies
Is now excepted as an art:
Which made me cry out in this wise,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
Such are most wise and honest now,
As sonest can their friends beguyle:
Such does the most sort best allow,
Whose talk is fair and deeds most vile.
Simplicity is in exyle,
And as for truth can make no mart:
Which made me morn and cry this while,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
Gods word both to and fro is toste,
As men do with a tenis ball,
And wrested from pyller ^o post,
To serve men's turn for sin and all:
But few from wickedness do fall,
In godlynes to do their part:
Wherefore thus cry I ever shall,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
Of wexe they make scripture a nose,
To turn and wring it evry way,
With many a false and filthy gloss:
Such as by errors walk astraye
The same do wrythe souls to betraye,
And from the truth do them peruerte:
Wherefore I shall cry day by day
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
No error since Christ did ascend,
But now it starteth stoutly forth:
The seamles coat of Christ is tend,
And unity is nothing worth:
Wherefore plenty is tournd to dearth,
And many plagues shall make us smart:
Wherefore my cry still forward goes.
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
But sure such hearts as here have woe,
And in this world do moan and morn,
The lord Christ has promised so,
That they shall joy his face beforne:
When such as here deryde and scorn
Shall suffer sorrow for their part:
Which ^ewdly have them selves forlorn,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart.
Woe be to you that here rejoice.
Ye shall hereafter weep and wayle:
For that ye would not hear the voice
Of Gods word for your own a^ayle.
Which (although heaven and earth do fall)
Shall still remain and bide in quarte:
Wherefore my voice shall never fail,
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart
For all the birds with merry song.
And the bright shyning of the son
And pleasant flowers I went among,
From woe my heart might not be won:
To see what worldly men had done:
For all do ride in sin his carte.
Wherefore I end as I begone
Lord Christ help evry woeful heart,
Amen.
A ditie named blame not my lute which under that title touches, replieth,
and rebukes, the wicked state and enormities of most people, in these present
miserable dapes.
^ BLame not my lute though it do sound
^ the rebuke of your wicked sin,
^ but rather seek as ye are bound
^ to know what case that ye are in:
^ And though this song do sin confute,
^ and sharply wyckednes rebuke:
^ blame not my lute.
My lute and I sithe truth we tell,
(Meaning no good man to off^nde)
Me think of right none should refell
The godlynes that we intend:
But much rather if they have grace,
They will our good counsel embrace.
Then blame my lute.
Although my lute with sentence plain
Rebuke all such as feign and gloss,
With flatterers and lyces vain,
That truth to falshod can transpose:
Ye though we sharply speak and sing
Against false and crafty wynnyng,
Blame not my lute.
And if my lute sound in your ear
The privy hate and lark of love,
And how ye should sclander forbear,
Sith gods word does ill tongues reprove:
Though as saint James we do express
The same, a world of wickedness:
Blame not my lute.
Though my lute do expres and show
That prayet and holy fasting,
Is turned now with high and low
To unclean talk and banqueting:
Although we say that chastity
Be gone, and in place lechery.
Blame not my lute.
Though with their own few be content,
Chastely to live with one good make:
But rather the most part be bent
Their constant vow for to forsake:
Though some in Sodom rather bide,
Then honest marriage to provide.
Blame not my lute.
If my lute blame the couetyse,
The glottons, and the drunkards vile,
The proud dysdayne of worldly wise,
And how falshod does truth exyle:
Though vice and sin be now in place,
In sted of virtue and of grace.
Blame not my lute.
Though wrong in justice place be set,
Committing great iniquity:
Though hipocrites be counted great,
That maintain still idolatry:
Though some set more by things of naught,
Then by the lord that all has wrought.
Blame not my lute.
Although each man find fault with other,
And no man will him self acuse,
But each man blames his brother:
Though he him self as great fault use.
Though we see none their own fault find,
Nor call repentance unto mind.
Blame not my lute.
Though my lute say that such as preach
And should men lead in ways direct
Do live amys, though truth they teach,
Which causes truth to be suspect,
Though my lute say such cause offense
Through their great sloth and negligence.
Blame not my lute.
Though some gods word do still despise,
For beggetly traditions:
Advancing highly feigned lies
Of men's imaginations.
Although my lute do such accuse,
As by errors gods word abuse,
Blame not my lute.
Although we see the clergy slack,
Wrong ways by right for to redres:
Though some also go rather back,
Then proceed forth in righteousness:
Although we say that avarice
Does stop the mouth, and choke the wise.
Blame not my lute.
Though offenders be borne withal,
Although the wolves in corners lurk
That have and will the lambs make thrall,
And daily do their false seats work.
Though whispryng treason in the ear
Burst out sometime without all fear.
Blame not my lute.
Though some also abuse the lute
With sinful songs of lechery:
Though some go forth as beasts brute,
In false treason and treachery:
Though at each sermon we may see
Gods holy word scorned to be.
Blame not my lute.
Blame not my lute I you desire,
But blame the cause that we thus play:
For burning heat blame not the fire,
But him that blowth the cole always*
Blame ye the cause blame ye not us,
That we men's faults have touched thus
Blame not my lute.
Blame not my lute, nor blame not me,
Although it sound against your sin:
But rather seek for to be free,
From such abuse as ye are in.
Although we warn you to repent:
Which grant you God omnipotent.
Blame not my lute.
A song of the lute in the praise of God, and disprayse of Idolatry.
Sing this as, My pen obey. etc.
MY lute awake and praise the lord,
My heart and hands thereto accord:
Agreing as we have begone,
To sing out of gods holy word.
And so proceed till we have done.
Praise we the lord in this our song.
And sing it Christen men among,
That in a godly race do run:
The which although it be not long,
Shall be right good or it be done.
This pleasant song shall not song be,
To the goddess of lechery:
Nor to nothing under the Sun,
But praising of the almighty,
My lute and I till we have done.
This teaches us David the king,
With harp and lute give God praysyng,
All men that in this world do won
To God therefore give praise and sing,
As my lute and I have begone.
This lord first made al things of naught,
And when against his law we wrought
From heaven he sent down his son:
Which with his gospel us all taught,
After the which we have not done.
Although in man wear nothing good
Him to redeem Christ shed his blood,
with thrones ye Iu^s our lord did crown,
He suffered death upon the roode:
Lo thus our saving health was done.
On this therefore we fix our faith,
That Jesus Christ (as scriptur says)
Is only our salvation.
Upon this rock who so him stayth,
Thus says the lord it is well don.
But one thing sore my heart does grieve
That hipocrites made us believe
In Idols both of wodde and stone:
From Christ our rock they did us drive,
Woe be to them what have they done.
Which canker still within their hearts,
Does yet remain and few conuertes:
For at gods word they frete and frown,
Therefore my lute it is our parts
Them to rebuke as we have done.
God sent his word unto this end,
That we our sinful lives should mende:
And yet repents few or none:
My lute therefore let us intend
To say the truth till we have done.
If in our song we should recyte.
Now each estate does not upright:
(Which will be their confusion,)
Which know the truth and do not right.
My lute when should our song be done.
But to be short my hearts intent,
Is to praise God omnipotent,
Who of our health the thread has spunne,
And has his word to us now sent,
To mende our lives till we have done.
Man's soul to save Christ died therefore,
Who of us men does ask no more:
But this lesson to learn and conne,
With love to keep his holy lore:
In which all perfect works are done.
Lord grant us to thy word to clean,
That no man other do deceive:
And in that zeal that I begun,
Lauding our lord God here I leave,
Be still my lute my song is done.

And let a godly life all new
Show forth fruits of repentance true,
And them express.

We may remayn without all strife,
In righteousness.
Let such as show the heavenly muse
Have godly conversation,
Least through their vile and great abuse
They work abomination:
When as in sinful ways they walk,
Contrary to their outward talk,
And gods true word.
For who that sclandreth so the truth.
Their mirth shall turn to woe and ruthe
Before the lord.
Let kings that mountains sygnifie,
In justice do still their due part:
Supporte no more iniquity,
Nor mainteyne such as areperuart.
Se that henceforth with all your might
Ye put down wrong and maintain right.
Or else surely
The lord God which is king of all,
Your glory*turne to shame he shall
Most ryghteously.
Let now the waueryng multitude,
That signifyd is by the sea,
Oh let I say this rabble rude
Still henceforth cleave to constancy.
And not them selves as waters show,
Unstable for to ebb and flow:
But still depend,
Upon the church to learn their due,
And serve their king with hearts most true,
Even still an end.
Let not the church be temporal,
Let not rulers ^e rude and vain:
Let no man from his calling fall,
But each man in his state remain:
Let not the common people deal
With matters high of common weal*
For why I say,
If one another calling vs^,
All equity they do refuse
From day to day.
Let all men now repent therefore,
And leave their sin without delay,
And henceforth use the same no more:
Least by their going thus astray,
Gods wrath in have they do procure:
For this their doyngs so vnpure
In sinful trade.
Know that the Lord his mercy still,
Does offer all with right good will,
That he has made.
Let men while mercy then doothe last,
Have mind of this their only mean,
Abhor their ill life that is past:
Lyftyng their eyes up into heaven.
Lokyng from thence for their relief:
Which is a salve for all our grief,
Sweet Christ Jesus.
Your hearts and ears I say attend,
That you to bliss without all end,
May hence ensue.
A Ditie declaringe the dangerous abuse of all degrees, which go astraye from
their vocation.
Perform O pen I thee desire,
The thing that we did late deuyse:
Blow to this cole, kyndle this fire:
That such may know as truth despise
That darkness shall no more them hyde:
No secret place shall they provide
To cover guyle:
For now the light shall them bewray,
That secretly have gone astray,
A right long while.
Such Princes as the poor oppress.
Under titie of governance,
And will no poor man's cause redress,
But all their joy and fine pastance,
Is how with craft in couerture,
They may in their ill ways endure,
And still remain.
It shall appear at the last day,
That they have wrongly gone astray,
Unto their pain.
Such prelates as for fylthy gain,
With errors do men's souls destroy,
And on their flock like lords will reign,
Wherein Gods word they do anoy:
The fleece to take is all their care,
And for the soul no food prepare,
But venym vile.
Such prelates shall once know, I say,
That they have falsely gone astray
With fraud and guyle.
Such men of law as will for gold
Make things seem right the which at wrong
And will for gain with falshode hold,
And eke delay the time to long:
Such as in Judgment wrest the law,
And wrongly do the sentence draw:
Wrong to supporte.
Poor innocents for to betraye,
For brybes they go from right astraye,
In wicked sort.
Such marchantes as are not content,
With right and reason for to win,
But daily do false fraud invent,
To gain by wickedness and sin,
^nlawfull gain, and usury,
And counterfetyng wyckedly
Much marchandyse,
In hell they shall once feel I say,
How they by fraud have gone astraye.
In vntust wise.
Such leches as wyckedly use
Medicines art, but not aryght.
But fasly do the same abuse,
And to that art does wrong and spyght:
They rob and murder where they go.
From place to place, workyng much w^
Without cunnyng,
The Devil shall them fetch away,
By such deceyte that go astraye,
With false wynnyng.
Such as in any kind of art
Do work both slyghtly and unsure,
For to deceive with a false heart
His neighbor, by his work vnpure:
slightly they work and all for haste,
wherein this day is wrong and waste:
Yea hateful wrong.
Sith now there is no faith nor fay
But all from truth are gone astray,
Woe be our song.
Such as break unity and love,
Such as by couetyse contend,
Such as will swear and great oaths move
Such as on whordom do depend,
Such as in pride do lead their life,
Such as by wrath do live in strife,
And great debate:
Satan with such must make afraye,
For their walkyng so far astraye,
Which god does hate.
God for his mercy grant therefore,
That men may now repent their ill,
And that they may their sins abhor,
Wherein they walked with their will:
It is high time for to redres,
And to absteyne from wyckednes,
For fear of pain.
And for Gods mercy call and pray,
That we through grace from this our stray
Come home again.
A voice from heaven to you shall come, Venite ad iudicium.
^ O Man amend defer no time
^ but be always in redines:
^ For if thou dwell in sin and crime
^ it will thee bring in great distres
^ for why a voice from heaven shall come
^ venite ad iudicium.
Then blessed shall that servant de
Whom God shall find in perfect mind,
To do his due in each degree:
For great reward then shall be find.
When that a voice from heaven shall come,
Venite ad iudicium.
Contrary wise the servant ill,
That walked in offenses great,
Contrary to his masters will,
With many strypes he shall be beat:
When that a voice from ^^^uen shall come,
Venite ad iudicium.
For God shall come right suddenly
In the mydst of your wyckednes,
When you think least appear will he:
From whose face none can you releace.
When that a voice from heaven shall come,
Venite ad iudicium.
Each lord and lady, King and queen,
Before that lord must bow their knee:
And then shall their reward be seen,
Like as their deeds and life has be.
When that a voice from heaven shall come,
Venite ad iudicium.
What shall anayle you then your pride,
Your welthy pomp and dignity:
Your riches then must stand aside,
And not help your necessity.
When that a voice from heaven shall co^^,
Venite ad iudicium.
The shynyng face of God the Lord,
Your stony hearts shall then appall:
Because that ye so much abhorde,
His precepts evangelical.
When that a voice from heaven shall come,
Venite ad iudicium.
Then shall ye say, Woe worth the time,
Your laws against the Lord of blis,
That you made in despyte of him,
And all that his true members is:
When that a voice from heaven shall come,
Venite ad iudicium.
And you shall gnashe your tethe and say,
Lo (...) whom w^ did hate and mock:
We see them sytte in quiet stay,
Being the l^^des elected flock.
For now a voice from heaven is come,
Venite ad iudicium.
And we like fools have erred still,
O^^ worldly wit is now all spent:
To pl^ad our cause we have no skyll,
Before the lord omnipotent:
For now a voice from heaven is come,
Venite ad iudicium.
The son of wisdom and of light,
Of understanding, end of grace,
Did give to us no kind of light:
We are undone alas alas.
For now a voice from heaven is come,
Venite ad iudicium.
In payns of hell thus shall they cry
That now do Christ his flock oppress,
Tormented still eternally
With devils for their wyckednes:
When that a voice from heaven shall come,
Venite ad iudicium.
Therefore let us defer no time,
But be always in readynes:
That we may all to heaven clyme,
Wi^h Christ the king of ryghteousnes:
When that a voice from heaven shall come,
Venite ad iudicium.
Against pride.
^ YOu proud men all I say abide,
^ and banishe pride out of your heart:
^ if climing high ye happily slide,
^ then are ye like to feel some smart.
^ therefore I say in time convert
^ repent and turn, for that is best,
^ yer dreadful death do you areste
Study therefore in holy write.
And know how that lucifer fell.
Which being once an angel bryghte:
God for his pride did him expel
Out of all light, down into hell.
Lo here you see the fruit of pride,
I say therefore lay it aside.
Before your eyes fix also this,
How Nebucadneza^ the king,
(Whose deeds in Daniell written is)
Who praisde him self above all thing,
And gave not God his due praising
Was made an ox and did eat hay
Seven years, his great pride to alaye.
And king Hetod (as says scripture)
As he was clad in proud a^aye,
His own honor for to procure,
To his own praise great words did say:
Therf^re Gods angel that same day
Did stryke hun for his heart unwise.
Who unto death was eat with lyce.
Lo if God would such kings not space
To punysh, for ambition,
What shall we think he will prepare
To plague our sinful nation:
Which forsake, their vocation,
And will in no wise pride eschew,
Nor seek to serve sweet dame virtue.
For Solomon in sentence play ne
C^lles favor a de^eynyng thing:
Yea beauty is a thing most vain,
Wherein some have such delygh^yng:
Which in ill case once will them bring,
Gods heavy wrath they so procure:
Through their proud hearts vayn and vnpure.
For from the course of reason true
They seem to be unknown and strange,
That do delyght in the vain hew,
Of beauty, that so sone will change:
For that wherein their rude wits range,
To much more britle then is glass,
And fades as does in sieldes the grass.
More inconstant it is also,
That unto pride does you provoke.
Then wind that wandreth to and fro:
Yea much more vain the^ smothring smoke
Lo thus of vice you bear the yoke.
Of beauty proud more vile then slyine,
And fleteth faster then time.
A thousand things may beauty fade.
As wise men daily see and say:
For if a fever you invade.
And shake you but one simple day:
Is not your beauty gone strayghtwaye?
Your color shows your substance ^ust.
Even earth and ashes doung and dust.
If men were bent the truth to tell,
Is beauty any other thing.
Then color in the skyn or fell?
Wherein some have such reiosing?
But if as well were appearing
Their inward parts, then might we see
A sack, stufte full of doung fylthy.
What sight more strange may there apeare,
Unto our eyes so fantsy full,
Then see one bewtifull and clear,
Declare it self so unfruitfully?
And cause him whose wites be not dull
Him self to know, a dounghill dyght
As with a cloth purple and whyght.
What impudence, yea what madness
Is it in beutie to glory?
Forsakyng all sober sadness.
For things that been transitory?
Sithe more delectabilitie,
It is to some that see the same,
Then those that thereof bear the name?
I leave of here, for to recite
What other hurtes your beauty does.
With your apparel proud and light,
Tempting the Irailtie of weak youth:
Therefore use now meknes and truth.
This old said saw may warn you all,
That pride will surely (...) a fall.
An inuectiue against the most hateful vice envy. Sing this as Let now thy
power he great O Lord. etc.
ALl they that will of envy here,
Unto my song let th^^^ attend:
If you will ^erne, then draw you nere,
Let envious me^ their mysse amend.
Unto my lips have good respect,
And mark what shall from them ensue:
Envy with blyndnes does infect,
And still disprayseth dame virtue.
Within this world so full of sin,
It is a scabbe says Tullius,
If that such men as be therein
To virtue shall be envious.
Oh wicked world, full of ^nuy,
Polluted with despite and hate:
Receive again simplicity,
Take love, and banysh all debate.
Solomon says in sap^ence,
I will none envy nor disdeyne:
Banysh them clean from my presence,
Wisdom will none such enterteyne.
For hateful envy is mother
Of wicked words, fond, ferce, and fell:
Contrary wise love does cover
The words which are not spoken well.
Sithe love then is the remedy
Against envy that wicked vice:
Take love to you continually,
It is a treasure of great price.
Against slouthe. Sing this as, Of Ielousye who so will hear.
Mark and give ear ye slouthful me^,
And to my song give good respect:
Arise out of your drousy dell,
To Idleness that are subject.
Right truly said king Solomon,
As smoke the tender eyes offend:
So slothful men are wrath anon,
With such as move them to amend.
Go to (says he) thou slothful beast,
Go to and slumber out thy fill,
With folded arms lie down to rest,
According to thine idle will.
As one that iourneyth all day long,
So poverty shall on thee light:
And as a soldier fierce and strong:
Necessity shall show her might.
But who so is industrious,
And will his labor well apply:
His increace shall be pl^ntious,
And he shall have abundantly.
In slothful souls, thus says the Lord,
My wisdom it can ta^^ no peace:
Oh be converted by, Gods word,
Ye slothful men, and call^ for grace.
Who so to work no pain will take,
Bu^ lives in slou^h (thus says S. Paul)
His company we must forsake,
And g^ue to him no meat at all.
Thus says the lord, therefore awake
Thou that do sleep, and stand upright:
Stand up from death, for Christ's sake:
And Christ the ^or^ shall give thee light.
A description of avarice.
^ SAint Bernard says the chariot
^ of avarice is borne,
^ on four wheles of vic^s in:
^ through which the poor are torn.
The first is courag^ ^aynt and fond,
The next vngentylnes,
The third contempt, of God, the fourth
Of death forgetfulness.
And horses two this chariot draws,
That is as much to say,
As Raueny and Nygardshyp:
Which are in it always.
The Carter which does drive them both,
He is a greedye knave:
And who so would his name were known,
It is Desire to have,
That Carter dryueth with a whyp,
Which whyp of cord^s has twain:
That is, Great appetite to get,
And Loathe to yield again.
Right many of the cart have scorn,
And them that carts do drive:
Yet most men for to drive this cart,
This day contend and strive.
And they that take in most ill part,
Of carters to bear name:
Do drive this car^e of co^etyse,
And much delyght the same.
And such as wear both sylke and gold,
(That strange is for to see)
Do sue to master Avarice,
His carters for to be.
Where some were wont with spe^^^ and shield,
Their country to defend:
Have laid aside their armor quight,
And to this carte attend.
The Clergy which should preach and teach
If they did play their part,
Do lay aside the word of God,
And daily drive this carte.
The Merchant and the learned leche,
And eke the man of law,
Forsake their arts, and daily do
This carte both drive and draw.
And they that common carters be,
(O^ most men called so)
Do know least how to drive this cart
And farthest are therfro,
Our money (as says Seneca)
Ought ay to be our drudge,
To serve for our necessity,
And at our will to trudge.
But if we (as a lady d^re)
Make her our sovereign:
She will not mysse to bring our souls
Into eternal pain.
God of his mercy therefore graun^,
This cartynge we may leave,
To love and lyberalytie,
That we may always cleave.
Free from the thief and from the mo^he
That we may horde our store:
Forsakyng gredy avarice,
And drive his carte no more.
A dittie of the pen inueiyng against usury and false dealyng.
^ MY pen obey my will a while
^ till I see good to end this style:
^ for if all men would sin abhor
^ such songs we need not to compile,
^ nor my pen should write so no more.
If all men of their word were true,
Promis to keep and pay their due:
What ^^de had pens to work therefore?
But sithe no whyght will truth ensue:
Pens were as good to write no more.
Pens are abusde, and that daily,
About all craft and usury:
We may well say alas therefore.
And yet least we make them angry
It semes as good to write no more.
Yet let us show the lords intent,
How tha^ for gaynes naught should be lent,
All fashod God will plage right sore.
And yet my pen least we be shent,
It semes as good to write no more.
For all in vain we speak scripture,
To such as will in sin endure:
For they amend never the more,
But hate all godly counsel pure,
That warns them to sin no more.
Yet if all men with such pretense,
Should cease to show their conscience,
They should transgress gods holy wre.
Yet sithe none will it reverence,
It semes as good to write no more.
The scripture thus does specify
In David's psalmee, bl^ssed is he,
That lends freely rich and poor.
Without all gain of usury:
Yet do they use it still the more.
Though some for writing will us blame.
These crafty men, whom we not name,
These false got (...) they must (...),
To those of whom they got the same,
Or else be damnde for (...).
For though some men have been ^^ this.
In usury that did amys,
And have been warnde of it before:
That do repent yet few there is,
But rather use it more and more.
But sure in hell their bed is (...),
And all that use of craft the trade
Are like the same to rue right ^ore:
In craft and guyle yet sith they w^de,
It were as good to wryce ^^ more.
God grant as in this song is me^^,
We may amend all and rep^nt:
Rootyng out vice to the hard core,
To serve the lord omnipotent,
In love and truth for evermore.
An exhortation to wrathful men. Sing this as, I am the man whom God. etc.
IF wrath were painted out
In perfect lively hue,
As could Apelles in his life,
With colors ^yne and true.
Or as Demosthenes.
Deserybe it could with ^en:
As it is ill it would appear,
Unto these wrathful men.
Or he that cunnyng had
In me^re to recite,
Both soul and body how it noy^s,
As shows holy write.
Then should these wrathful men,
That anger will sustain,
Perceive the incommodities
That therewith do remain.
Concerning body first,
Diseases it does bring,
As f^uers vile of every kind,
Which mortally do styng.
It causes phrenesie,
And madness of the brayne^
Of visage great deformyrie,
And palscys this is plain.
Concerning soul also,
(The which is worste of all)
It makes men blaspheme their ^rendes,
And evil them to call.
Outrage and wicked oaths,
And love put out of place:
Reuengement is their whole desire
That banysht be from grace.
All benefytes forgot,
That to thee did thy friend:
Obedience true and reverence,
Wrath puts out of mind.
Whereof succedeth often,
Contention full of cost:
By trouble and unquiet mind,
Thine appetite is lost.
To scorn dysdeyne and hate,
Ye think it is no shame:
All though nothing can hinder more,
A good report or name.
These wicked fruits of wrath,
Remember he that can:
Full little haste (as I suppose)
To wrath they would have than.
Hark and give ear ye men
That thus to wrath are bent,
Attend a while unto my tune,
And hold your self content.
For as thou art a man,
Think also so ^^ he:
With who^ thou do conceive such cause
So wrathful for to be.
Is it not laufull then,
And as conuenyent,
That he with thee should be as wrath,
And as much discontent?
Leave of your wrath therefore,
I say to you again:
Assure your selves that angry men,
Do always live in pain.
And call to mind how Christ
The son of God most hye:
Which in a moment by his pow^^
His enmies might destroy.
How did the Jews him grieve*
Having no cause wherwre:
His most sweet face they struck in spite
And buffeted him sore.
It nothing irked them,
At him to spyt in scorn,
With witness wrong accusyng him,
And crowned him with thorn.
His vertous body lo.
They haled to and fro:
An heavy Cross on him they layd^,
The more to do him woe.
All faultlesse as a lamb,
To suffer death he went:
They did his body all to beat,
And yet was he content.
They naylde him on the cross,
This should we bear in mind:
This suffered he of his good will,
For Moses in this zeal,
The Tables brake of stone:
In which God with his finger wrote,
His ten precepts each one.
As David meant when he.
Right holyly did say:
Be angery, but do not sin,
By no manner of way.
It was in Christ also,
(As holy wryt does tell:)
When he out of the temple whyp^
Those that did buy and sell.
Within his holy place,
Where nothing else should be.
But prayer to the living God,
In secret that does see.
And at an other time,
It shewde in him again,
The hypocrites when he rebuk^,
As Matthew tells plain.
This simple song all ye,
That hear or do it read:
It is enough to cause you all,
Of wrath to take good head.
Of sinful wicked wrath.
Beware in any wise:
To all men that have wit in store,
Let this as now suffyse.
In hearing of their faults,
That they may mend them soon.
And aft^r stand at Gods right hand,
When they receive their doom.
An Inuectiue against wrath* Sing this as, The living God our only Lord,
that. etc.
Solomon says, A fool his guyse,
Is to be wrath immediately:
But he is to be counted wise,
That well can hyde his injury,
Therefore saint Paul does say of trauth
Let not the sun rest on your wrath.
And Plato being demanded,
Whereby a wise man known should be:
Said, if wise men be rebuked,
Therewith they will not be angry.
Therefore saint Paul does say of trauth
Let not the son rest on your wrath.
By as also does right well show,
Of wrath the discommoditie:
Saying that it in high and low,
To counsel is chief enemy:
Therefore saint Paul does say of trauth,
Let not the son rest on your wrath.
The chiefest help against the same,
Seneca does describe right plain:
Take Patience that godly dame:
In her sight wrath can not remain,
Therefore saint Paul does say of trauth,
Let not the son rest on your wrath.
Of wrathful men it is the wunt
To sow discord with each estate:
But patience does always hunte
For to appease strife and debate.
Therefore saint Paul does say of trauth,
Let not the son rest on your wrath.
Therefore with men replete with ire
Use no familiarity,
And those whom wrath sone settes on fire,
Bide thou not in their company:
But as saint Paul does say of trauth,
Let not the son rest on thy wrath.
As says saint James be swyft to hear
The thing that may thee edify,
Be slow in speech in like manner,
But slow to wrath especially:
For why saint Paul does say of trauth,
Let not the son rest on your wrath.
By wrath as says saint Gregory,
Wisdom is hid and out of sight,
And puts all out of memory
That should be done by wisdoms might.
Therefore saint Paul does say of trauth,
Let not the son rest on your wrath.
My brethern here to make an end,
I you commit to patience.
As servants true do you intend
To serve her grace with diligence.
Because saint Paul does say of trauth,
Let not the son rest on your wrath.
Against drunkenness and gluttony.
Sing this as, Of Ielousy who so will hear. etc.
ADrunken workman certeynly
By labor never gets ought:
A little he settes nothing by,
But from a little commes to naught.
For learned men how may suffice,
Their wine in little quantity:
So in their rest and exercise,
It does none incommoditie.
Woe be to those that early rise
(The prophet says) to make great haste,
And drink till night (as is their guyse)
Till reason banysht be at last.
A drunkard (as saint Austen says)
Offends nature very sore,
Castyng aside both grace and faith,
He hedlong runs to hell therefore.
The moderate use of drink and meat,
No wise man hates, this is true:
But lust inordinate and great,
Ought every good man to eschew.
Saint Jerome says, Cursed be they,
That in their meat have such delight.
That reason can not cease nor stay
Their vile and gredy appetite.
Saint Ambrose plainly does express,
A worse to serve can none invent
Then gluttony, that ill maystresse:
Desyryng still, and nere content.
Nor nothing more infaciate
Then glottons bellyes most like hell,
For that which they received late.
Right early they again expel.
These farsted panches aye abhor,
Good continence and chastity:
Before digestion they crave more,
Forsakyng virtue fyithyly.
All Christians therefore I exhort,
Voluptuous excess to forbear:
To moderation now resort,
And frugally live in gods fear.
Lechery rebuked. Sing this as, On tabrets to the Lord. etc.
LIke as the fow^er with his bayte.
Soon brynges the byrd in snate,
So are men's souls through lechery,
Destroyde yer they be ware.
For lechery (Gods ennemy)
With virtue is not plaste:
Of present lust a foul delyght,
And of substance a waste.
It blyndeth men, that they think not
On dreadful poverty:
Which from great use of lechery,
Long absent can not be.
To bring a man to beggars state,
Of harlots is the trade:
Therefore absteyne from lechery,
Let it not thee invade.
For if we shall consider well,
Man's nature excellent:
The hyghnes and the dygnitie,
That God thereto has lent.
It is a foul and wicked sin,
To use it wantonly:
Resoluyng it unhonestly,
In fylthy lechery.
How honest and how beautyfull
To live contrary wise,
In continence and temperance,
Sobrrnes to deuyse.
For lechery and sinful lust
In youth who so does use:
Shall wythred be with feebleness,
In age for this abuse.
Take heed therefore, let not your hearts
In harlots snares be caught:
Absteyne from them, frequent them not,
Their paths be very naught.
The houses of such harlots are,
Of helie the very snare:
Their chambers unto dreadful death,
Full well we may compare.
For grace therefore pray we to God,
And unto wedlock cleave:
Of lechery and sinful lust
That we may take our leave.
An earnest complaint against Idolatry. Sing this as, In my trouble and pain.
Sometime that I have seen,
To see again were strange,
In place where I have been,
In hope no more to range.
In wyckednes and sin,
And in Idolatrye:
Which who so use, shall win
Hell euerlastyngly.
For from the face of GOD
There can be nothing hyd:
Who has full often forbod,
That we against him did,
To worship an Image,
The Lord does most abhorte:
But in our pylgremage,
We honored great store.
That time I trust be past,
For custom made us blind:
And Iam sore aghast,
Lest worse be left behind.
Beware while you have space,
That Idol of the heart:
Lest at the last it chase,
Your souls in hell to smart.
Beware and take good head:
Lest that er ye be ware,
Ye do so far proceed,
That ye no more repair.
Example ye may see:
As Solomon does say,
Take time while time may be,
For time will soon away.
Repent therefore in space,
While time to you is lent,
And call to God for grace,
With true heart and intent.
Least when ye would right fayn^
There shall no grace be sent,
As subject to hell pain
In sorrow to be shent.
An inuectiue against sclanderous tongues.
Sing this as, If truth may take no trusty hold. etc.
IN sadness set with woe oppressed,
Often did I sighe by my constraynt:
From depnes of a pensive breast,
Thus carefully came forth my playnt.
O sclander vile and tongues untrue,
Unbridled lo thus ye proceed,
And cause the careful heart to rue,
That did no fault by word or deed.
Not all for naught (I well perceive,)
King David did on you complain:
Sithe naught may let you to deceive,
And utter fruits of your disdain.
Deliver lord my soul says he,
From lyps that lie for me in weight*
And from such tongues as ever be,
In use with falshod and deceyt.
What reward then may we deuyse,
For tongues quod he that speak unright,
The whottest coals in burning wise,
With arrows sharp and full of might.
Among men mortal on this mould,
I think there is no vice nor crime,
So wicked by a thousand fould:
As ill tongues are this present time.
Which ernestly has given me cause,
If David meant not fire of hell,
That I may ad thereto this clause,
With lucifer that they may dwell.
For nothing in this life certain,
We may so well to hell compare,
As envious tongues that not refrain,
To gender still both strife and care.
For as they are a punishment,
A hell to good men and a strife:
So may in hell be their torment,
When they depart out of this life.
And as they burn till they burst out
In wicked words and sclander vile:
In hell so may they bear a rou^^,
From heaven having their exile.
A complaint against euel tunges
Sing this as. I am the man whom God. etc.
WEll may the wise deteste
The fruits of tongues untrue:
Which never cease but still provide
Their malice to renew
There is no time nor place,
That may them ones refrain,
No virtuous mind nor exercise,
That may their vice restrain.
To selaunder and detract
And vlab the same about:
A wicked thing when they conceive,
They straight way put it out.
As Socrates has said,
No worse thing can be found,
Then wicked tongues, from who^ deceyt
And falshode does redound.
What wyckednes is there,
That may compared be:
Unto the false and fylthy tongue,
In any one degree?
For where all other hurtes
By death are vanquished quite:
Even after death the wicked tongues
Do utter their despite?
Which causes me to think
As Chilon did yet while:
No sword that cutteth half so kene,
As wicked tongues and vile.
Of which most wicked vice,
I never yet could find:
Not hai^^ ^o much in any wight,
As in the female kind.
In whom it does abound,
With detestable rage:
That no device nor yet constraynte
May cause it to aswage.
O detestable tongues,
O fylthy sinkes of hell,
O wicked ounce whose hatefulnes
All other does excel.
Right aptly was it calde,
A world of wickedness:
Sith nothing in this life so much
Does innocents oppres.
By paynfull proof I found
Such fruit, that wrought me woe:
For wicked tongues have caused me
My playnt to utter so.
Do me not blame therefore,
That I on them complain:
The simple worm when ye him tread,
Will turn his tail again.
A ditie made in the time of the the swearyng plague. Anno. 1552.
O Plague possessed with mortal might.
(so far as god does give precin^t)
Well may thou move the christian right
Upon his lord and God to think:
And show him well by tokens plain,
How that he shall from sin refrain.
My flesh is frail and shakes for fear,
My soul is strange and has no doubt,
And hopes for health, and seeks where
It may be had, to find it out,
The scripture says be strong in faith:
And then be not afraid of death.
In this my need thy help to have
To thee O god I cry and call,
I thee beseech my soul to save,
From Satan sin and hell and all,
Though I O god have done amysse:
Thy death shall me direct to bliss.
Then welcome plague the guide to health
And death also the port of life.
Sithe that this change is perfect wealth,
Out of this vale of most vile strife:
Why should we then thus fear to dye,
And end our fatal destenie.
Oh folysh flesh so fond and frail
To rage against all ryghteousnes,
I will that thou shall not peruayle,
To follow thine own filthynes:
For I will set my whole delyght,
To fight against thee with my sprite.
That virtue excels both riches and beauty.
^ Since nothing can be sure,
^ that has no perfect ground:
^ how can the thing endure,
^ uncertain that is found.
What so beginning had
Must have his fatal end:
And nothing good or bad
Has other way to bend.
All those that buylders be
Upon uncertain stay:
Their works as we may se,
Do vanysh sone away.
And those contrary wise
That ground their matter well:
Their work shall well arise.
And perfectly excel.
When marriage then is made
For riches or for gouide:
If goods and riches fade,
The love does lose his houlde.
If beauty eke so gaye
The cause be of thy love:
When beauty fades away.
Thy fantsye will remove.
For if the cause do quayle
Where one the mind is bent:
The effect then must fail,
What so therein is meant.
Then virtue shall be best,
Who so will it retain:
All other being cest,
She ever does remain.
For beauty being gone,
Whose dwelling is not sure:
Dame virtue still alone
For ever will endure.
And when gould has his end
The causer of much strife:
Yet virtue shall extend,
And garnysh well the life.
A good reward also
To lovers does she give:
In keeping them from woe,
A quiet life to live.
If marriage then be wrought,
On virtue buylding love:
No such thing can be sought
To stand without remove.
Ye that will web therefore,
On virtue set your cure:
All contraries abhor,
So shall your love be pure.
For better were the time
Of death, and of the grave:
Then otherwise to clyme,
A wedded love to have.
For goulde does cause and gain
Contention and vnreste:
He that has most, will feign
Him self to be the best.
And beauty often does bread
Mistruste and ielousy:
But virtue has no sed^
Of such iniquity.
Then happy is the love
On virtue which is knytte,
That still without remove
Continue will and sytte.
Which in this life cause is
Of praise and godly fame,
And also after this
Of heaven for the same.
Nomen Authoris.
IN hope I do endure
Of that which I intend,
Having my fantsy sure
No false thing to pretend.
Hope still does me allure,
At their hands whom I serve,
Like goodness to procure,
Lo as I do deserve.

REmember well ye men mortal,
From whence ye came, and go ye shall,
Of earth god made thy shape and form^
And unto earth thou shall return.
Remember well. O man I say,
Thou art worms mea^e and very clay:
Thou art none other this is just,
But earth and ashes dung and dust.
Remember well though thou be young,
Thou art naught but a sack of donng:
Defer no time till thou be old,
For of long life thou have no hold.
Remember well though now thou some
As beautyfull as king or queen,
That when thou shall depart and dyt,
Thou shall rot, stynke, and putrefye.
Remember well thou dounghyll, dyght
With garments gay to please men's sight.
Remember earth thy first estate.
Thy lions heart it will abate.
Remember well that thou shall come
At the last day unto thy dome:
Where if thou do thy self exalt,
In extreme pain remain thou shall,
Remember well I say aloude,
Thou earth and ashes be not proud,
Such cost on earth why doste bestow?
Leave of thy pride be meke and low.
Remember and in fine mark this,
Who so of him self humble is,
The lord will him exalte on hye,
In heaven above the sterry sky.
The faithful soldier of Christ, desires assistance of God against his
ghostly enemies.
^ HEreout O lord the right request,
^ of him that feign would have redrest
^ the wrongs that are so sore increst,
^ with in my soul so sore oppressed.
O lord to thee with woeful cry
I call for grace and for mercy:
And if thou help not, then truly
In deadly woe remayn must I.
The world, the devil death and hell.
With great assaults against me swell:
Lord let thy grace in me excel,
Against their fury fierce and fell.
O lord my God to the I pray
Suffer me not to go astraye:
And have in mind the price and day,
Wherewith thou didste my ransom pay.
Oh have in mind thine own great cost
And let not this thy pain be lost.
In the O lord my trust is most,
To dwell among thy holy host.
Thou know wherein my help does stand.
Whereuer I be on sea or land:
Good lord put to thy helping hand,
Save me from hell that fierce fire brand.
An exhortacion to brotherly love and unity.
^ Behold it is a joyful thing,
^ that brethern should continually

This godly love David lykned
Unto that precious vnc^ion,
Which descended upon the head,
And into the beard of Aron:
Which being powered on his crown,
Was ever more still descendyng:
And from his beard it dropped down,
Into the skirtes of his clothing.
And as this precious ointment sweet,
Did smell all of one sweet savor:
For Christen brethern it is mete,
To be all of one behauour.
He that loves God above all thing,
His neighbor as him self like wife,
Fulfyls the law in so doing:
Which Christ would have us exercise.
For where this godly love does bide.
There present is the lord Jesus:
Which never from his flock will slide,
It they in love continue thus.
Love not y^ world (thus faith S. John)
Ne any thing conteynde therein:
For who so settes his love thereon,
The love of God is not in him.
And none can love the lord above,
Whom with our eyes we never see:
If we our brethern do not love,
That always present with us be.
Let love therefore be among us,
And from it let us never swerve:
As we are lovde of Christ Jesus,
Much more then ever we deserve.
The dew that fell on Syon hill,
The which descended plesantly,
Is nothing like this love until,
Belovde of god et^rnally.
For god from ^yme to time does give
To this love his holy blessyng:
For all that do with love believe,
Shall reign in joy without ending.
He (says the lord) that loves me,
Does keep my law and holy lore,
And unto him given shall be,
A crown to reign for ever more.
Lord in this love we thee beseke,
To set us in a quiet stay:
That we being loving and meke,
May reign with thee in hlys for aye.
The just and true man complains, that flattery and falshod is more regarded
then truth, and reioyseth that he is hated for the truth.
^ IF truth may take no trusty hold,
^ nor cleue so fast as flattring sense,
^ well may thy heart poor man be cold:
^ for then is gone all sure defense.
The Nyghtyngale must change her note,
And of the Cucow learn to sing:
The modest mind must learn to dote,
Or conne some other fayued thing.
If meaning well may take no place,
Nor dealyng just have no regard:
Thou must deuyse an other space,
To feign such things as may be heard.
Shall virtue dwell in such disdain,
And honesty be had in hate?
Then must we learn to gloss and feign,
Orels remain in vile estate.
But if there be none other way,
To purchase favor and good will:
Better it were I dare well say,
In vile estate to tarry still.
What call ye then the vile estate?
As some do judge this is the thing:
If my superior do me hate,
And would me to displeasure bring,
And that also without desert:
(If reason may the cause decerne)
And have disdeyn for my true heart.
Wherefore to please I am to learn.
Yet is mine heart determind sure.
If truth and reason take no place:
Of such disdeyne to take no cure,
But wise men rather will embrace.
For if wisdom were noblenes,
As noble birth and riches is:
Then should not truth be in dystres,
And flattrye should of favor mis.
So flattrye and bland eloquence,
Should (as they are) be compted vile,
And truth should then make none offense
Nor virtue reign in such exyle.
Blamd, but not shamd, the proverb is
And truth can have none other wrong:
So may they hap their mark to mys:
That think them selves in falshod strong.
Then hated lo I must rejoice,
And fond regard despise as vain:
Closing my mouth stoppyng my voice,
From speech in presence of disdain.
An wholesome warning for all men that bear the name of Christians, to live
Christianly.
^ O Hark a while unto my style,
^ all ye that Christians be,
^ that bear that name
^ and do not frame
^ your lives accordingly.
Is Faith in syche,
As being rich,
(Though they do Christ profess)
That every hour
Do Christ devour,
And his poor flock oppress.
For we are all,
As says sayn^ Paul,
Members of one body:
Of Christ Jesus,
^ round of virtue,
And of all verity.
Then the poor man,
(As prove I can)
Is Christ his member true,
As well as he,
What so he be,
That riches does endue.
Why should ye then,
To simple men,
Bear such despite and hate?
Sith they be all,
In Christ equal,
With you in all estate.
Christ his kingdom,
Was never won,
By wealth or high degree:
All though that here,
Some do appear,
To reygne in dignity.
Then let none think,
That Christ will shrynke,
When he shall judge us all:
Of all your wealth
So got by stelthe,
You to account to call.
When if he find,
Ye were unkind,
To your poor brethern dear:
Then will he say,
Go from me aye
Into eternal fire.
When I lackt meat,
And feign would eat,
In sycknes thyrst and cold^:
In all my need,
Not one good deed
That you to me do would.
Then will ye say,
Without delay:
Lord when did we thee see
Lack any food,
To do thee good,
And did it not to thee?
And he again,
Shall answer plain,
I truly say to you:
Ye still oppreste,
And much detest
The poor my members true.
When ye therefore
Did them abhor
That ^re of low degree:
To me alone
And other none
Ye did that injury.
Saint John does prove,
We can not love
God whom we do not see
If we do hate
Our brethern, that
Are present to our eye.
Now call for grace,
While ye have space,
Your wicked lives amend:
And so proceed
In word and deed,
True Christians to the end.
A short song exhorting all men to abstain from the use of false weyghtes and
measures.
^ MY heart constraines my mouth to tell,
^ the duty of each worldly wight,
^ how they be taught in the gospel,
^ one with other to deal upright:
^ with even weightes and balance just,
^ so do we must.
So do we must, this is no nay,
Also with measure just and true:
Who so does not at the last day,
Right sore are like for it to rue:
When he shall go for want of breath
Unto his death.
Unto his death when he must go
With painful panges and torment strong:
Then is he like to suffer woe,
For that his dealyng false and wrong.
Such one is like, in extreme pain
For to remain.
For to remain, woe worth the while
That any man so fond should fare,
With oaths his neighbor to beguyle,
When he should truly sell his ware.
O wherefore then d^o ye unwise,
Prudence despise?
Prudence despise? that should so well
L^ade you in Godly ways and right:
And teach you also how to deal:
With your neighbors justly vpryght.
For he that to amend denayes,
Thus the Lord says.
Thus the Lord says very certain,
Such measure as ye mete to other,
Such measure shall ye have again:
How then if you deceive your brother?
Thynk you that God will forget this?
No no Iwys.
No no Iwys ye may be sure,
For heaven and earth shall jointly sayl^*
But Gods word shall for ever dure,
In force and strength still to prevail,
All false dealers for to expel
Down in to hell.
Down in to hell, therefore take hed^,
And call for gods grace and mercy:
Amend your wicked lives with speed,
Lamentyng them repentantly,
God give us grace so to intend,
And there an end.
A Ditie declarynge the sted fast hope and trust that the faithful afflicted
soul has in Christ Jesus.

Mine enmies strong.
All the day long,
To do me wrong
Is their intent:
Every hour
On me they loure,
Me to devour
They do invent.
This do I see,
For to mine eye
It is truly
Always object.
With might and main,
Them selves they strain,
My soul to gain
And to infect.
My soul therefore,
Does tremble sore,
And evermore,
Does stand in fear:
And all the while,
Mine enmies smyle.
Me to beguyle
They not forbear.
Therefore I say,
My s^ule always,
Rei^yce and stay,
Thy self in Christ.
Though men extold,
Against thee hold,
In Christ be bold,
Them to resyst.
Who is alive,

I need not fear.
O God of might,
Strengthen my spryte,

Only in thee.
O holy Lord,
Let thy sw^^e word,
With one accord,
Still be with me.
O Christ Jesus,

To thee I pray,
Grant that I may,

A song showing that no commodity is without a discommoditie.
Sing this as, I am the man whom God. etc.
AS I did sytte and muse
Once by my self alone,
The wretched state of worldly wights
The mind was fixed on:
How no commodity
May here with man endure,
Without some discommoditie,
To show it self vnpure.
By fire we have great aid
In cold us for to warm:
Which in an hour sometime does burn^,
Rewarding us with harm.
We may live certain days,
Without both drink and meat:
But without air not one moment,
The lack would be so great.
Yet sometime by his rage
We mortal men do find,
That trees houses and cattle eke
Are overthrown with wind.
The water who can lack,
That in this world does bide?
Yet many one therein is drownde,
By great aboundyng tide.
The earth whereon we dwell,
And seek great wealth to find,
In sekyng to possess the same,
With judgment vain and blind:
When we think to possess
This earth that we attend,
Behold the same possesses us,
In it we take our end.
The Summer which does repe
Our sede, both corn and fruit,
Alas to hot, this heat to hot,
With men thus goes the brute.
And as with summers heat
We do complain and scoulde:
So do we wayle on wynters there,
And blame him for his could.
No wealth without some woe,
No Joy without some care,
No bliss without his doleful bale:
Thus wretched men do fare.
We seek for sugared wealth,
As we should aye dwell here,
The bitter galle of mysery,
Therefore does strayte appear.
The wine that cheres the heart,
Does often times vex the brain:
And woman made was for man's help,
Who does him often great pain.
Sometime we call for dryth,
Some time we ask for rain:
Some time we say we have to much,
Of each thus we complain.
In musyke we delyght,
And call for it some time:
Whereof we sone be weary lo,
And blame our selves of crime.
And judge our selves to be
Both vain, fond, and vnpure:
Because our mirth without sorrow,
No long time does endure.
And while this dreadful care
Had fraughted thus my breast,
I me bethought what might be found,
To purchase here most rest.
And that we might let pass,
With less disease of mind:
These contraries that us assault,
Of so repugnant kind.
And temperance was the thing,
That then came to my thought:
A better aid in such a case,
Is no where to be sought.
And therein seek to find
The will of God above:
And do the deeds prescribed us,
Within the law of love.
The just innocent complayneth on sclanderous tongues.
^ LIke as the lark within the marlions foot
^ from solace supplanted it were with me,
^ if thou lord were not my buckler and boot:
^ at whose hand I hope salvation to see.
My hope and health lord is only in thee,
My castle of comfort my shylde and defense:
From sclanderous tongues Lord deliver me,
That they no just cause have through mine offense.
So shall their deceites turn to their own shame
Although for a time they chance to prevail:
When truth shall be tryde, and vtred by fame,
Their falshod may faynte and utterly quayle.
For they do report that I never did,
My judgment and cause I yield unto thee,
That out of this woe right feign would be ryd,
And never did why so sclandred to be.
Oh merciful lord creator of all,
I do remember men sclandered thee:
Great devil and Beelzebub they did the call,
Thy miracles daily though they did see.
If thou se it good thy servant to try
By sclander of tongues and untrue report:
For patience thy gift, to suffer I cry,
Rememberyng thee, my self to comfort.
For help at thy hand I only resort,
Resolve their hard hearts and cause them relent:
For they that love evil do always suporte
All such as to lies and sclaunder are bent.
Yet if thy will wear that they might repent
Confessing their fault, their falshod and guyle:
To comfort somewhat the poor innocent,
That falshod and lies has put in exyle.
Thy glory so should we largely express
And teach it to men, and cause them to fear,
Which were for this crime a perfect redress:
For nothing so much could make the^ forbear.
Thus all my whole cause to thee I commit,
My matters with thee I always decyse:
Justly in judgment because thou do sit,
And ryghteousnes is thy whole exercise.
O lord give the^ grace, to leave there great crime,
And me for to suffer, and walk without blame:
So will I endeavor from time to time,
To bless and to praise thy most holy name.
The innocent sclaundered complains praying for the conuertion of his enemies.
^ AL co^fortles lo without any aid,
^ now should I remayn if God were not he,
^ which in ye defense of good me^ has said,
^ in all their distress their helper to be.
My hope is therefore sure fixed O lord,
That thou do abhor all untrue report:
And as thou do bid in thy holy word,
All only for help to thee I resort.
From thee O good lord there is nothing hyd,
Provoke them by force their life to refrain:
For they do report that I never did,
Accepted of such as lies do maynteyne.
Good lord let not them their purpose obteyn,
Which in these my days would turn me to shame
Not that I refuse to suffer the pain,
But only that it turn not to their blame.
My harms be heinous when they me defame
But yet the most harm to them does return,
When they upon me do report the same,
That they can not prove, it makes me morn.
Lo thus am I bent in good part to take,
The sclander of tongues, rememberyng thee,
Contented to suffer all things for thy sake,
For vengeance only belongs to thee.
Oh merciful Lord I render therefore
To thee condygne thanks, which art my defense
O strengthen me then good lord ever more,
That I may still suffer with pure patience:
And finally grant oh merciful lord,
That these false liars may turn and convert
And being instructed by thy sweet word,
They may be right sad and sorry in heart.
To God our Creator and lord omnipotent,
The Father, the Son, and the holy ghost,
Three persons and one God most excellent,

The complaint of Christ our savior against the Ingratitude of mankind.
This of the Lord is the complaynt,
Of man, how he was sold and bought:
And thus he said him to attaynt,
Mine own people what have I wroght?
For toward me thou art so faint,
And I thy love so dear have bought.
Thy answer look thou nothing paynt
To me, for why I know thy thought:
Have not I done all that I ought?
Or else what have I left behynd?
Thou sterst my wrath, I hurt thee naught,
Why art thou to thy friend unkind?
I sought thy love it was well seen,
When I thee made so like to me,
Mine earthly works both quick and grene,
To thee I gave both fruit and tree:
From Pharao that was fierce and kene,
Out of Egypt delyueryng thee,
I killed him and all his men,
And the red sea in twain did fl^e:
Which I commanded dry to be.
The water serude thee and the wind,
From bondage so I made thee free.
Why art thou to thy friend unkind?
Full forty years in wyldernes,
To win thy love I did the lead,
Toward a land of great riches,
With Manna also I thee fed:
To thee to show my great kyndnes,
Thy kind to take I had no dread.
I left my might, and took mekenes,
Mine own heart blood for thee I bled:
To buy thy soul my self I led,
And bound my self thee to unbind.
Thus with great p^yne thy turn I sped*
Why art thou then to me unkind?
For thee I ordeynd Paradyse,
And shewde to thee my Testament,
And thou again dydst me despise,
In breakyng my commandment.
Thy sins were great in diverse wise,
For to my foes thou dydst consent:
Down I thee thrust, thou could not rise,
Thy wyts from thee away they went,
A naked wretch poor, shamd, and shent:
And as for friends thou could none find,
But I which on a cross was rent,
Why art thou to thy friend unkind?
Thus I lovde thee, but whom lovst thou?
I am thy friend, why wylt thou fayn?
I gave thee life, and thou me slew.
Who parted thus our love in twayn?
Turn thee to me, bethynke thee how
Thou have done ill, come home again.
And thou shall be as welcome now,
As he that free from sin did reign,
Think how did Mary Magdaleyn.
What said I to Thomas of Inde?
I grant the bliss, why wylt thou pain?
And art thus to thy friend unkind.
Of friends I am the best and chief,
Thou wylt me neither dread nor please,
Of thy true love to se a prefe,
My love to thee would much increase,
For thy misdeeds I suffered grefe,
And thou dydst me that same disease,
Hanged I was most like a thief.
I suffered death thy pain to cease:
Yet to love me thou do not prease,
Nor bear not my pain in mind:
But seekst Idols in thy disease.
To me why art thou so unkind?
Unkind, for thou have slain thy Lord,
And every day do wound him new:
If thou be brought unto accord,
Of covenant made, thou art untrue:
To thy old sin thou do resort,
Thou love vice hatyng virtue.
All false Idols that I abborde
To honor thou wylt not eschew:
But to my lively Image true,
The poor, the halt, the lame and blind,
To offer thou wyle not ensue.
But rather art to them unkind.
Thryse did the fiend tempt me truly,
And thou doste tempt me day by day,
With syane and vice most wyckedly,
To stir my wrath thou wylt assay.
Thou do as who so would me buy,
As false Judas did me betraye:
For at my works thou have envy.
There is nothing that would thee stay,
If thou on me myghtst as I may.
Full cruelly thou would me bynd:
If I forgive thee thou sayste nay,
Why art thou to thy friend unkind.
A Ditie warnyng all towns and liberties to chose their governors for virtue
wysedom and lernyng: and by all means laudable, to keep from rule the proud
envious and wylfull wicked men: lest the prince be dishonored, and they them
selves abused and oppressed.
Sing this as, If truth may take no trusty hold. etc.
VVher pride does hold the helm in hand
The ship to rule by wylfull will,
Often times we see on rock or sand,
Both ship and goods do jointly spyll
As Phaeton proud, most wylfully.
His father Phoebus charyot,
Would prease to rule, till foolyshly
He nygh spylde all, such was his lot.
Whereby as Ouide plain does tell,
The wrath of Jove he did proueke,
In flood of Po him down to fell,
With dreadful dynt of thunder stroke.
The like thing may be seen ^^he day,
In ship of public governance,
Where only pride and will bear sway,
Sekyng all discord to advance.
For reason there is ca^tiuate,
Re^ect and cast cut as a slave,
Till their own swing does bring the quade
Whose end does show how much they r^ue.
Wherefore if I might counsel give,
When as the matter lies in choice,
Blind ignorance should not acheue,
To win to rule by common voice.
For by their rude and ^onde abuse,
The prince they do dishonor much,
And subjects poor they much mysuse,
Of pride and will the fruits are such.
Then best it is for to reject,
The blind the ignorant and rude,
And virtues chiefly to respect,
And wisely so your choice conclude.
If that ye knew the difference,
Between the wise and learned men,
And rude unlearned negligence,
Much more respect ye would have then.
For look how far a lusty wight,

Does still surmount in each degree
The infant young that can not go,
But must of force be led or borne,
So far extends learning lo,
The rude and ignorant forlorn.
He that in all his life and days,
His own affections can not rule,
But beastly is in all his ways,
As any saluage horse or mule.
Or he that his house how to guide
Or household yet could never tell,
Can such be mete at any tide,
A town of folk to govern well?
Have this therefore before your eyes,
Whom henceforth ye do chose or take,
Virtue embrace, and vice despise,
A right good choice so shall ye make.
Esteem him ever as most ill,
Which by his froward mind unjust,
Despysyng law will maynteyue will,
To lay good order in the dust.
If any man perceive this case,
Or have experience of this cry me,
Virtue henceforth let him embrace,
And take more head an other time.
A brief description of wysedom and folly in governance.
Where wisdom bears sail,
In ship of common wealth,
Like are they not to fail,
Law, love, good hope and: health,
Justice shall there avail,
All wrong to overthrow,
Men dyng both high and low.
In like wise and manner,
Of folly to defyne,
Right may no rule bear there,
Debate so does enclyne:
And peace can there be none,
Ye may thereof be sure:
Nothing but pain and moan.
Ever do fools procure.
A brief Description of truth and falsehode.
Truth shall triumph and falshode fail,
Hope in the Lord so has us taught:
Of falshode shall the cunnyng quayle,
Most, when she has her malice wrought:
As of the truth it is the guyse,
Suppresiyng wrong, and then to rise.
Why then does falshode make her bost,
Of her deeds as they should endure:
Only a while they rule the roast,
Doubtless their buyldynges are not sure.
Myschief to do they men allure:
And yet is all that they invent,
Nothing stable ne permanent.
An exhortation to truth, faith and virtue.
EXamyn well thine inward spryte,
Direct thy ways with perfectnes:
Make straight the things that are not right
Vex not thy friend with unkindness.
No lie for gain see that thou make,
Do nothing ill for frendshyp sake.
Have still in mind the truth, which says,
All things are vain that have an end.
Let all thy works be done in faith,
Like that whpch Christ does most commend.
A de scription of man's life both in his own affections and virtues.
WE may by proof behold and see,
In this world what is man's delyghte,
Lewd is our life naturally,
Lack if we do gods holy sprite,
Injury, hate, wrath, and despyghte.
All that to pain shall us procute,
Most we frequent and put in ure.
In virtue yet those that do dwell.
Occasyons ill they will eschew,
Remembryng that such as do well,
Doubtless the Lord will them endue,
All goodness that they may ensue.
Yea and them keep so safe and sound,
None ill shall them hurt or embrace,
Endeuoryng still just to be found.
A friendly advertisement.
Rejoice in him that did thee make,
In weith and we have him in mind,
Conceive none ill, all vice forsake:
Health in thy soul so shall thou find.
And wh^re thou art a loving frynde,
Revoke it not, but stay thee there,
Decay no love but hate forbere.
To proved friends commit thy trust,
And ^lee from such as feign and gloss,
Note one thing well, and keep it just,
No secret of thy friend disclose,
Except counsel disdain it not,
Repent thou may else well I wot.
That self love and avarice, wear never true friends.
Marvel not, though the faunyng tongue
All other does excede in guile,
Rather think how the foulers song
In to the net does birds bewyle.
In couetise or in self love,
S^ that ye put no steadfast trust:
Lest confused your fancy move,
Ever complainyng of thuniust.
A description of friendship.
IN friendship true there surely is
Of nothing lack, or scarcetie,
He which is friendly does not mys,
No time his friend to gratefye.
Never therefore was frendshyp found,
In self love, or in avarice:
Contrarily it does abound,
Occasion shewde in exercise,
Love never does his friend despise,
Sure frendshyp knows not her own.
Of this description to the wise,
Now he^ceforth may friendship be known.
An opening of the rude peoples inconstancy.
Read who so will in wise writing,
It shall be easy to conclude,
Commonly how the rash doings,
Have of the most fond multitude
Always been vain and very rude.
Rauyng they do reuers certain,
Devise of wise men to disdain.
Have in their mind therefore this fear,
Of their deeds be suspicious:
Out of all doubt their fond manner
Can not be but pernicious.
At all times therefore let the wise
Revoke their ways and enterprise.
That flattery and sclaunder are of all wise men to be taken head of.
RIfe in this life is rude report,
Of such as order do disdain:
But who so will to bliss resort,
Avoid must all their scouldinges vain:
Regardyng in his mind all whole,
To run a pace and win the gole.
Trust not to much the faint frendshyp
In such as flatter for a gayn,
Ne yet the leude and lying lyp,
Like one like other is certain.
Ye therefore ought him well to prove,
Endeavor that ye do to love.
That a constant mind is a great pyller of bodily health.
HEalth of body for to procure
Expediente a constant mind:
Nothing does better be you sure,
Dircet you health and wealth to find:
Remember that the life unstable,
Is found in no man commendable.
For custom (Aristotle says)
Is like to an other nature,
So that he which him therein staith.
Has good assurance long to dure,
And who the same to rent is ryfe,
Regards neither health nor life.
REspect ever and have regard,
Ill men from good for to divide,
Constantly keep both watch and ward
Hate ill men's deeds on every side.
Again with just men at each tide,
Regard to dwell, and them frequent,
Decyse with them your whole intent.
Benevolence se you bestow
Always on such as love virtue,
Regard also to overthrow
Hateful sinners, who vice ensue,
And always company the wise:
Make speed from vice and fools despise.
A commendacion of virtuous exercise.
Invention of the mind ingenious
Of godly things and of humane science,
Has and shall be with men good and righteous,
Noted still as a point of excellence.
Continue still then in thy diligence.
Let not the world pluck back thy good intent,
And sure god will always be thy defense
Regardyng thee and thy doings decente.
Know that the lord is still the good ma^s guide,
Enuyronyng his ways on every side.
Against vndece^t busy medlers in other men's vocation neglecting their own.
REason would that in the public estate,
Of evry realm, where order would be had,
Because thereby the better to void hate,
All such should be esteemed to be mad,
Rudly that will his own calling forsake,
To use others, him self a f^ole to make.
Better it were that each in their degree,
Endeavor would to follow their own art,
Then fondly as experience we may se,
In breaking order cause the selves to smarte.
Nothing on earth, the which has undone mo,
God for their plage has wild it to be so.
For c^rteynly the discontented mind,
Extremely does him self thereby torment,
Living ^o get they do many fetes find,
Dotyng in all that ever they invent,
Ever therefore to constancy be bent.
Of fortune.
Who so would know what fortune is
To Chilons answer take goo head.
When like demand as now is this
To him was put, he said in deed:
A leche right leude, they did her find
That trusted her: she made them blind.
Or thus out of Justinius.
EXamples great were without end,
Uneath possible to be toulde,
I might unto the mind commend,
Therein to stay if now I should:
How changeable how frail and fond
Is fortune for to understand.
Which never yet made any joy
But sorrow straight ensude the same,
And does her self prepare to noye
Most when the semes to noryshe fame:
Nor never struck the sorrow stroke,
But where she first with joy did mock.
Of honor out of Tully.
HOnor as Tully does wysly repete
In, wise men does norysh both wisdom and skill,
And praise in the wits does kyndle a heat,
And also to study does stir up the will.
Of glory.
IN three things it does well appear
Where perfect glory does remain.
The first is where as far and nere
The multitude in love does reygne,
The second is as I perceive,
Where they to good opinion cleave.
The third is where they marvel much
At us, and do us well esteem,
And think us able to be such
As they of worship worthy deem:
And so with love and good pretense
Do gladly give us reverence.
Of vain glory.
Of this vile world the vayn glory
Is a swetnes full of deceit,
A fear fyxed continually,
Advancement bydyng dangers bayte:
A thing begone without foresyght,
And ends without repentance quight.
Or thus.
By clymyng high did never joy
So swyftly yet ensue,
As (in the falling down to woe)
Our sorrows do us rue.
Nor yet renoume by victory,
Does not so much inflame:
As does in ruin vile reproch^
Of follye, us to shame.
Of grace out of S. Bernarde.
In three things lo consists grace*
Right well to know as I do think,
Of faults now paste abhor the trace,
And present joys despise and shrynke:
Desyryng only things to come,
Prepared for us all and some.
Of temperance out of Plutarche.
What may we think that man to lack
In any one degree,
To live in joy and perfect wealth,
And pure felicity.
Whose virtue lo does him discharge
From sorrow and from fear,
His temperance constreigneth him
All extremes to forbear:
And calls him from carnal lust,
In thought, in word and deed,
That in rejoicing folyshly
He never does excede.
Of tale bearers out of saint Hierome.
The tale bearer that wicked man
Which by his sinful sleyght,
Does mynysh love between true friends,
Through his most vile deceyte,
Offends in much worse degree,
Then he that would constrayne
The meat out of the beggars mouth,
Whom hunger sore does pain,
For look how much the soul excedes
This mortal body here:
So is the food that fedes the soul
More precious and more dear,
And much more ought estemde to be,
Then that which here does feed
Our carein vile, that daily does
Offend in word and deed.
Of virginity.
THe holy man faint Ciprian
In praising of virginity.
Sister of angels called it than,
To vanquysh lusts valiently:
Of virtues lo she is princes
All good things eke she does possess.
A maidens speech should be therefore,
In sobernes right circumspect.
Let bashfulnes also be more
Then eloquence in all respect,
Apperyng seld, few times and rare,
Use well the ears, the tongue to spare.
When that ye speak, speak so that men,
May wonder at your shamfastnesse,
When ye speak not prouyd that then,
They may likewise your soberness.
Lo these few things that I have said,
Should be the garments of a maid.
Of Arrogancy in students.
ALl arrogancy from study seclude,
Lest thou remayn still unlearned and rude,
For all that the best learned man does know,
Would make a baren and very bare show,
His knowing with unknowing, if were in sight,
For why his ignorance is infinite,
Wherefore the cumbrance of arrogance,
The greatest hyndrance is unto study.
For many might have come to wysdoms lore,
If they had not thought themselves there before
Of reverence to age.
AGe and discretion in any wise,
Look that thou reverence, and thereto arise:
Give place and head thereto with diligence.
For therein consysteth great exyerience.
For if thou will here an vpryght life live,
At their hands thou shall that knowledge atchiue:
With godly life, and true felicity,
In grave judgment and worldly policy.
Of truth and falshode. Truth does with truth for ever consent, But falshode
with falshode nor truth no^ content.
Of Inhumanitie.
OF great rudenes it is an argument,
And that he is both proud and insolent,
In stout disdeyn that will still remayn mute.
To those that gently him greet and salute.
Or if that we should not again for our part,
Show the right fruit of a gentle heart,
To wyshe well to them that wyshe well to us:
We might well be thought beastly and barbarous.
Of constant temperance.
Though fortune her face turn from the and fail,
Be of good chere, let not thy heart quayle,
For often after mornyngs careful and sad,
Succedeth euenyngs both merry and glad.
Of truth and lying.
As profyt by lying is uncertain gain,
Which can not long dure, nor steadfast remayn:
So damage that men by truth get among:
Such trouble I say can not hinder long.
Of the errors of the common rude multitude.
LOdouicus Viues in sentence plain,
With words that be wise affirms certain,
That thopinions of people tumultous,
Is commonly hurtful and pernicious.
Their brains and heads so grossly understand,
That all their judgments are foolysh and fond.
For truly the vulgar people ay is,
Scholemaister of errores, and things amys.
There is nothing upon this earth therefore,
That in our study we should seek for more,
Then him to bring that knowledge would obteyn,
By wysedomes rule, in which he takes peyn,
That he eschew the judgment vayn and rude
Of the most waywarde wauryng multitude.
First therefore that he then be not infect,
It does behoue him still for to suspect,
What so the multitude with great assent,
Seem to allow with their common consent:
By such wise men's rules till he them well try
Whose measure is virtue, to prove matters by.
Against vain apparel, out of Lodouicus Viues.
Garments of profyt to cover the body,
Were first invented by necessity,
Riches and riot found garments precious,
Which vanity formde with trycks superfluous.
Thus in vestures the diverse invention,
Has drawn folk to proud and folish contention
And brought them to toys hurtful and vain:
For each one would now great honor attain,
By that which shows most our infirmity,
Our folly weakness and great misery.
Against anger out of the same Author.
THe angry man for his countenance fell,
His sharp words and his deeds fierce and cruel,
Does ^ft lose much of his authority,
Men from him withdraw beneuolencie,
His friends him forsake, and no man therefore
Will gladly him mete, but all him abhor:
Wherefore all wise men of grave experience,
Eschew nothing more, nor more diligence
Do use in ought, then their anger to cloak,
And all works of ire to shun and revoke,
In so much that they wrestle not only,
Against their nature and infirmity,
But spyght of her beard they put her to flight.
Ye give her the fall, and banyshe her quyght.
Of friends, out of the same Author.
CHose them for no friends in deed nor in word,
That will at thy life still gest mock or board,
And such as pass little to scoff at each tide,
At that which most secret thou would hyde:
But yet most of all avoid shun and flee
The frendshyp of such as quyckly will be,
For things of naught straight at defyance,
With their best trendes, kyndred and alyance,
Reuengyng also them selves much more
Upon such as they have loved before,
Then on those foes which they always did hate,
And with whom they still have been at debate,
Persuadyng them selves most barbarously,
That of their most friend the small injury.
It is to be forborne or suffered less,
Then of their chief foe the most wickedness,
Which vain and vile words do show forth and move
Declaryng most plain they never did love,
Sure if they had, love would have extended,
That they could not so much have been offend
Make never no friends of such as be those,
For better it were to have them for foes.
Dulce bellum inexpertis.
As flies often times in candle flame.
Do play till they be burnt and dye:
So many think the wars but game,
With danger till the truth they try.
Or thus.
As Flies delyght is often to play,
In candell flame till death they taste,
So many will the wars assay,
That after soon repent their have.
That the rich and myghtie should not hate the poor and lowly.
AS the grape beatyng vine lively,
The little tree does not despise
That does him bear, so should perdye,
No great estate if they be wise,
Dysdeyn the subject or servant,
Whose aid of force they may not want.
Or thus.
Like as the vine that flourysheth,
With lively grapes and leaves most g^^er
The small tree never despyseth:
That bears him up as it is seen.
So ought no rich nor high estate.
The poor or simple wight to hate.
Of formed fyllets and disformed forheds.
A Lady had a forhed fair,
Formed very feateously.
For in the mydst a typ of hear
Came down before right proprely.
Both sides were bare and cowlyckt hye.
Wherefore she did in have deuyse,
As in her glass she late did prye.
To form her gear after that guyse.
Her forhead clothes and other tire,
Were altered straight unto that like,
On both sides crokyng like a wyre,
And down before a pretty pyke.
All other women great and small,
That did this trym new trycke behold,
Old, young, yea rich and poor and all,
Their forhed clothes so cut and fold.
But some that feign would so be dressed,
Dame Nature straight denyd them that,
They could not be trym like the rest,
Their forheds low wear like a cat.
To that which was to some decent,
To others did as much disgrace:
Which caused them str^yght to invent,
So pluck the hear of from their face.
Wherefore first as the fair lady,
Her fyllet like her forhead formde,
Some worked the clean contrary,
Their forheds like fyllets deformde.

A description of dignity or true Nobleness.
IF thou a noble man wylt know,
A great estate and honorable,
He is (as Chrysostom does show)
To vices nothing seruisable:
But does detest and much disdain,
Subject to be, to vices vain.
If thou (as Seneca does tell)
A man wylt in sure wise esteem,
Or know him perfectly and well,
What he is, and so truly deem:
Thou must him see in fashion rare,
That is to say naked and bare.
Possessions let him lay aside,
And put from him authority:
And let nothing with him abide,
But natures gift and propretie:
All fortunes fables in likewise
Thou must in this thy search despise.
In fine and last of all the rest,
Let him put of his own body:
And then beh^ld within his breast
His soul, and vewe it certainly:
For so shall it be truly known.
What he has of his very own.
For it in me deserves no praise.
That I of others do receive,
For look what nature me denayes,
I can not have, but do deceive,
As with a false and feigned sin.
Bragging with that which is not mine.
He that can vices overcome.
Is then the chiefest conqueror.
He that with virtue bears room,
He is a man of great honor.
He is noble and of great might,
That shunnyng wrong imbraceth right.
The anotomy or particular description of a byrche^ broom or besome: In the
composition or making whereof, are contained.iii. notable Justices or purgers of
vices.
A Byrchen besome that ye a broom call.
Is made of a with, a staff, and twygs small:
By which all folk of each age and estate,
May governed be, if nourture they hate,
As first the small twigs do serve a good shyft,
The buttockes of boys to hoyse up or lift.
From which it is sometimes needful to draw,
Abundance of blood to keep them in awe.
The haft of the broom like purpose shall serve,
To shrub well their backs that strypes do deserve
And namely such knaves that are grown so bygge
That they nothing set by any small twygge.
Therefore is the staff a tool for the nones,
To canuys their backs, or kydgell their bones.
Then thyrdly the with will hang by the neck
Such thieves as fear not the strype nor the check*
Thus in every house.iii. Justices reign,
Which the byrchen besom well does conteyne:
The high and the mean, and also the low,
Th^yr offices all, ought each man to know:
By whom al such men must needs pass their way
The rules of reason that will dysobaye,
The highest Justice the neck will out stretche,
The low from buttockes will skyn and blood fetch,
The mean must needs shrobin the shoulders stout
Of each stubbern varlet lubber or loute,
The low Justice now he that will reject,
Nor his life by rule and compass direct,
Neglec^yng the small, he stireth the great,
The ha^te of the broom the shoulders ^must beat,
By which back beatyng if he will not mend
The with must him hang, and so his life end.
Lo thus may they see that wisely behold,
The besome has uses many a fold,
Besides that for which most men do them keep,
Namely their kitch^ns or houses to swepe:
For he has office men's vic^s to purge,
By three Justice rules, that sharply will scurge.
For who so ever they do in hand take,
Either good or dead they will him sure ma^^:
Good, if by virtue from vice they will v^^y,
Dead, if by vices they do the contrary.
The description and declaration of a monstrous child, borne in the town of
Maydston in the County of Rent, in the year of our Salvation. 1561.
the.xxix. day of September, being Say^cte Mychaell the Archangels day,
between two and three of the clock in the morning,
Since monsters as some learned men declare,
Do demonstrate, to us our monstrous life,
Repentantly let us our hearts prepare,
Sin to aduoyde, wherein our fete be rise:
For why we walk deuoyde of love in strife,
And for the most part council men do scorn,
Which monstrous ways cause monsters to be borne
Behold those eyes which monstrously strout out
Which typeth forth our boldness to do ill,
And where it has no forhead without doubt,
The lack of shame right plainly show it will:
Such shameless grace we se frequented still,
Whiles we stoutly our naughty ways defend,
And seem gods word to mock and reprehend.
It has no neck, which may also express,
That lack of love does reign in every wight.
No paps nor te^ts which signifies no l^sse.
But that we do regard no truth nor right:
To nouryshe virtue few have now delyght,
But pride, and foolyshe fondeand vayn attire.
Of women chiefly now is the desire,
Such ruffes, such rolls, such folysh tricks beside,
More heathenlyke then any Turk does use:
In wicked ways thus bodly do we glyde,
And holsom counsel most folk do refuse,
Thus monstrously we walk in great abuse,
As God by tokens does to us declare,
That paynfull plagues he does for us prepare.
A hole it has deep in the head behynd,
Covered over with a fleshy flappe,
Thus were these parts contrary unto kind:
Which may declare and signify perhap,
With feigned manners how we do us wrap,
Apperyng outward honest fair and gay,
Corrupted inward with most wicked way.
The buttockes also joined are in one,
Without a twyst the same for to deuyde,
Yet some there were that looked it upon,
That took great pain the matter for to hyde,
Astribyng it to chance that might betyde
Unto the woman, while she therewith went,
As hurt or bruise, so vayn heads did invent.
But who that will discretely the same vewe,
Shall find that God therein has wrought his will
And their surmyse to be false and untrue,
With lies that would our ears and wit so fill,
That we should not repent us of the ill,
That caused God thereby us to amend,
This token great before our eyes to send.
Presumpteous boldness in unshamefast ways,
Is terms courage or au^ aciue,
But shame to sin is counted now a days
Great folyshnes, and dollysh dastardy.
So ryfe so ripe is now iniquity,
That fearful signs must feign be us to teach,
That no man else can do although he preach.
Let us therefore have sufficient regard
To these great works of God showed to us:
Least death and hell do shortly us reward,
For these our sins that we committed thus,
Let learned wits now more at large discuss,
By these great monstrous tokens what is meant
But in the mean space let us all repent.
An exhortation to al preachers of the Gospel, that they ought to preach as
well in works as with words: if they will preach profitably, namely to the
conuertio^ of souls to the truth.
THe first mouer from east to weste.
That turns the star^y sphere,
Under the which the several orbs
The wandryng lyghts do bear.
By endless turnyng in that course
That all men do perceive,
Contrary to their stryuing way,
Which f^w folk can conceive.
Twelve thousand times has borne the son
This endless halle about,
Beshyning all our hemisphere
With beams* most clear and stout.
(Which cutting cross our horizon
The night away did drive,
And from this arc by glistryng light,
Did darkness still depryue.)
Since parents procreation
My life did first begin,
And nutriment performyng it,
Till that I breath did win.
And yet in this number of days
I never could epsy,
Or on that wight once fyx my look,
Or see him with mine eye,
That carry could a good report
Unto his final grave,
Which in this life did not subdue
The flesh when it did rave:
Or could not with a most sharp byt
The heady sins refrain,
Subduyng frail affections,
As with a bridle rain.
No though he could well prophesis
And profitably preach:
And as a heavenly messenger,
The gospel purely teach,
If life and conversation
Does not thereto accord,
His labors are abandoned,
His preaching is adhorde.
For in bare words does not consist
The pure sincerity:
But perfect works does chiefly show
The Christian verity.
And only wit in speaking well,
Does show his force and might:
But wisdom ever is expressed,
In dealyng just and right.
Thus wit can say, but wisdom does
All things godly and just.
Wit in good words, wisdom in deeds
Is known and well discust.
As works then do all words excede,
And doing speech excel:
Though wit may make a glorious show,
Yet wysdom bears the bell.
How many preachers have been staynde
That spoke eloquently,
Which wanting wisdom, could not work
Therewith accordingly.
Wherefore the wise philosopher
Unhappy did them call,
Which had a wit, and never could
Attain wisdom withal.
For wit does serve wisdom to learn,
In each reasnable wight:
Wherefore they are but beasts, who not
In wisdoms schole delyght,
If wysdoms work then follow not
O^ wy^ what is theffecte:
To what end are these goodly words,
If good works be reject.
What are the fruits of lyvly faith?
Which are the tokens true,
Of those whom God in Christ our health
With grace does still reuewe?
Is it not life agreeable
To that ye teach and say?
How can ye otherwise with gloss
These verities denaye?
To what end speak ye all these words
Wherein ye so glory?
Is It not as good of godly deeds
To tell an history?
Who best think you should me persuade
Their church and faith to love?
Or who to follow or believe
Should the most men's hearts move?
Of him that said, and no good did,
Or he that held his peace,
Walkyng a go^^ and Christian life
Among the (...) prease?
Though faith by hearing come in deed,
Which I will not deny:
Words void of works did never yet
Work half effectually.
It is but like the flowers gaye
That floryshe fair and grene,
And wyther straight as soon as son
Does whot upon them shine.
Like wytherd hay upon house tops,
That many times does grow:
Which suddenly does spring and spread,
Making a braggyng show:
But straight for lack of perfect root
Or ground whereon to stay,
It wytherd is, that no man can
His handful bear away.
Wherefore unless ye preach with works
The fruits of wysdom pure,
Your wytty words are vanity,
Your ground is nothing sure.
How some have given vile offense
I need not here to name,
For wise men will my meaning see
And do but read this same.
And who so by an others fall
Can stay and take good head,
That man to be wytty and wise
We shall believe in deed.
A buylder wise upon the rock
Christ does him ryghtly call,
That does the gospel hear or read,
And do thereafter shall.
Contrarywyse the negligent
That gods word understand,
Are lykned to the folysh man
That builded on the sand.
Of which he first was able well
All storms for to abide:
Where as the last unconstant was
And subject still to slide.
Wherefore for Christ's blood I say,
Ye preachers all beware.
And that your life make none offense
Se that ye set your care.
For cursed are ye, if ye do
Gods work negligently:
And here I end sith ye do know
The same as well as I.
But he that knows his masters w^^,
(Take this for your fare well)
And does it not: with many stripes
Shall beaten be in hell.
Against y^ dissimulacion, craft, un consta^cie, false dealing, gredy
covetousness, intemperate catynge and drynkyng, and incontinencie of an old man,
and the cause why the author and others forsook and refused the society of
such one.
O Monstrous satyr
Of insaciat mind,
Whose fylthy desire
All virtue does blind.
Can neither thine age
Nor experience,
The vile lust aswage
Of concupicence:
Can not the balde head,
With bearde and hear white,
Once stand thee in sted
To bridle delight?
Can not the dim eyes
And nere four score years,
Once make the despise
That in thee apperes?
How shall the young man
His ways reform then,
As David does scan:
When such are old men?
If learning nor time,
Nor number of days,
Can scour away crime,
The cause of disprayse?
Nor scripture study
In such a long space,
Made at hand ready
Assistance of grace?
How can thou thy self
Gods messenger name?
Sith in this vile pelf,
Thou semest past shame?
But what man has seen
As yet other fruit,
In such as have been
So beastly and brute?
With God and man to
Dissemblyng to lie:
Where all that they do
Is Hipocrisye.
For he that will cloak
The enmies of God,
And say they revoke,
(That God has forbod)
To shield them from law,
And danger of crime,
By craft for to draw
And detract the time:
How shall we him think
The brydgroms true friend,
That falsely does shrynke
From him to the fend?
And that to make truse
Between wolves and sheep,
Good men to misuse
That did the flock keep,
Between saynctes and dogs
What feloshyp is:
Between fylthy hogs
And children of blis?
Between the elect*
And vile reprobate?
Between the reject,
And blessed estate.
Between good and bad,
Between heaven and hell?
Between subject sad
And traytrous rebel?
Then those that proteste,
Such vice to forsake,
How can they request,
A peace for to make?
Making but one church
Of virtue and vice?
How falsely such lurche,
Is known to the wise:
If riotously
To lashe out and waste,
Most prodigally
Of deynties to taste.
The redyest way be,
To please God aryght,
And Gods face to se
And serve him in spryte.
If to be careless,
To burden ones friend,
And to make redres
Have never in mind,
Borowyng frankly,
No caryng to pay:
And sometime falsely
To shyft so away:
If to be wandryng
So fugitiuly.
Leauyng the living
Sure and constantly.
Intendyng thereby
With sl^yghtes to deceaue^,
With sub^iltie slye,
Both to take and leave.
If bybbyng of wine
Till belkyng boil out,
Be the true right line,
To find heaven out.
If lascivious talk,
Prouokyng to sin,
Be the way to walk
Heaven bliss for to win.
Then fare well say I
All works and virtue,
We may well defy
All good dealyng true.
But woe worth that such
Had ever the place,
That so and so much
The truth do disgrace.
Why takste in thy mouth
My word says the lord?
That have from thy youth
All virtue abhord.
Thy life to accord,
Doste also despise:
Myxyng with my word,
Papystry and lies.
If these causes now,
Be full sufficient,
Such to dysallowe,
And from him descent.
Also to abstain
Him to hyde or cloak,
His doings refrain,
And also revoke:
My friends I desire,
That they bear with me,
Though I do retire,
And from such one flee.
For I think the pot
Scant whole will appear,
Nor from fylthy spots
The water be clear.
And rather I sure
Had life to forgo,
Then with mind vnpure,
Affectionat so.
With such one to bear,
In such confusion,
That can not forbear
His frail affection.
A song against the sinful time wherein all things are out of order, and sin
grows nere unto rypnes.
IT is not time
That sin and crime,
Might cease that ye might mend?
Can plague nor pain
Make you refrain,
Nor from wickedness wend?
Shall each brother
Malice other?
Can nothing you persuade,
Once to tender
Each good member
Whom Christ has bought and made?
Sith ye profess
Of faith no less
Then the Apostles all:
Should you d^spyse
Thus each good guyse,
With lives most sensual?
Can one vessel
At once expel
From him both sweet and sour?
Or can a man
Any time when
At once both laughe and loure?
As wolves wroth
Your selves ye cloth
In lamb skins to seem good,
Hipocrites subtle
Have hearts still britle,
Two faces in one whoode.
Commend they will
Gods sweet word still,
As though they lovd it well:
Yet they vary
Most contrary
Unto that pure gospel.
In psalms saying
And in praying
They seem to have perfection:
Yet their delyght,
Is all in spyght,
Which is a great infection.
In wrath and pride,
From grace they slide,
With fylthy fornication:
Envy and hate,
Excess, debate,
And all abomination.
In avarice,
Beyond all cyse,
And arrogant ambition,
Although they feyne,
An other vein,
They maynteyne superstition.
And he is well,
That can excel,
In vice and fylthynes:
Such strife to win
The price of sin,
Was never seen I guess.
Fylthy l^cur,
Does them procure,
To parcialytie:
For worldly gain,
They all are feign,
To work iniquity.
They prate and pray,
And well can say,
To purchase them promotion,
The world to win,
They sustain sin,
So vain is their devotion.
Flattryng they fleare,
Each other in theare,
To work their wicked mind.
They sclandryng s^ay,
Good men each ^ay.
As beasts that pass their kind.
They f^yne a face.
To run the race,
As men of Christ elect:
And yet in d^de.
They do^ proceed
With ^yues sinful infect,
They flatter can,
With every man,
Where gain may so be won:
Longer then gain,
They not remain,
Their fre^dshyp straight is done.
They will be meke,
And humbly crepe,
Where they no frendshyp bear:
Till their purpose,
They may up close,
And the^streight ways they ^care
On promise they,
No farther stay,
Then lucre does extend:
No faith nor truth,
In age nor youth,
But falshode all attend.
Much they pretend,
Fautes to amend,
And do for commonwealth:
Where in the end
They naught intend,
But private gain and stelth.
Ca me ca thee,
This still we see,
They wynke at wyckednes:
None but the poor
Does wrynge therefore,
And suffer the distres.
With hearts most stout,
They snuff the snout,
Like swyne y^ smell their swyll,
With haulty heart,
And mind peruarte,
To work their wicked will.
Such they oppress
As in distress,
Do want both help and aid:
Their cruel minds,
As fierce as fyndes.
By no means can be stayde.
No faith we see,
On earth to be,
Nor yet justice or right:
But bearyng out
Of falshod stout
By office pour and might.
Wherefore the day,
At hand I say,
Of force must needs appear,
This world to burn,
That thus does turn,
To worse from year to year.
A meruavlous dream of the Author: Anno. 1561.
When in the lion Phoebus had,
Obteynde the seuententh grade,
And on the bulls neck, Jove ridyng
The twyns for to invade.
And Saturn slow had in the Crab
Then entered one degree,
Mars from the waterman regre^t,
The goat again to see.
And Venus by conjunction,
With Phoebus late had line,
By backward course as she returnde
In Leone the sign.
And Mercury the messenger,
In May last past, was sent,
By mighty Jove, from out the bull,
And now in vyrgyn went.
Dyrectly walkyng through that sign.
The balance to pervse,
And in September turn and show
To Phoebus all the news.
Diana, rydyng on the ram,
Did on her brother look:
With tryne aspect, as with the like
Dame Venus late she took.
Intolerable was the heat,
That Titans burning beams
Gave on the earth when he put forth
His bright and shynyng leames,
Which parching heat, had made ye corn
Each where to change hy^ hew,
Which warning gave, that husbandmen
With sythes and sycles new.
Should now prepare to cut and bynd,
And in their barnes preserve,
Such necessary food as might,
For wynters need well serve.
What was the cause I leave to say
But suddenly that night,
Such tempest rose of wynd and rain,
And lyghtenyng in sight.
With thunder strokes most terrible,
And hasty storms of hayle,
As though God with destruction,
Would then the world assail.
When. iii, long hours this sturdy storm
Had his continuance,
It did assuage, and began to go,
In far other dystance.
And the deep night approchyng fast,
From prayre to sleep I fell,
And such a dream to me apperde,
As strange is for to tell.
Me thought I stood upon a hill
Where I hard by might see,
In a low plain of all estates,
A multitude to be.
Where every sort and each estate,
Did strive and much contend,
The gredy gayn of gold to win
Their hunger had none end.
So much to gold their love ape^de,
That naught else might he found,
To win or please, or to have fame,
Or in wealth to abound.
There saw I kings and rulers great
By tyranny to reign:
Whereas the great consuinde the small,
And wysedom did disdeyne.
Their subjects when they had oppressed
By heapyng of much gold:
They straight became ambicious,
Yea arrogant and bold.
Their own realms could not the^ co^te^t,
Their spendynges to discharge:
But they must conquer others right,
Dominions to enlarge.
And so with bloody victory,
Great terror and dystresse,
Of many poor, at last by force
They others land posseste.
Which notwythstandyng of.iii. heirs
Was not inherited:
But was again with loss and shame
Forgone and home rendered.
And others as ready again,
With like them to acquit,
As they before wear for to win,
And conquer others right.
There saw I judges in like case,
Whose mind did whole depend,
For him to do that most w^lo give,
And plentyfully spend.
For brybes and gifts bare all the sway,
In matters of the law,
For gain of gold, and for no right,
All matters did they draw.
All officers I did behold
From most unto the least:
Which without brybes had no regard,
To any man's request.
Yea offices were sold and bought
And not for virtue gaynde:
But all for gould, thus went the world,
For gould were all retaynde.
A fool as sone should have to do,
To rule a common weal:
As should the wise: vules by mede
He did his office steal.
Yet some desire (I not deny)
Of gold was to this end:
The glutton gutte of Epicure,
To fill full and extend,
For in some place no dronkard can
So often ill rule repair.
Nor yet frequent the tavern more,
Then shryfe Justice or Mayre.
The spectacle of all excess,
And mysrule to infect,
Was seen of them that ought of due,
Such vices to correct.
The rich did poor men vndermynd,
To make them travel sore:
And yet drue back benevolence,
And wages not the more.
But rather did wythdrawe the due,
They ought to have of right:
For pryuate gayue thus waded they,
With all their power and might.
To promise or to counant made,
There no man had regard:
For gain of gold all things vndyd,
Their doings well declarde.
No lease so good had any man,
Nor bond so surely made:
But gold was able to undo,
And utterly to quade.
Who had no gold, unable was,
His own right to retain:
Ne without gain no kind of force
Might permanent remain.
Right many that good science had
Vpryghtly with to live:
To tavern and to typple fell,
Thereto them selves to give.
Estemyng gain thereby to rise,
Much more abundantly,
Then by the former trade they used,
With living decently.
And diverse arts their trade did leave,
With hurt of common weal:
Forstallyng corn and v^ctuals all,
Vile gain thereby to steal.
The cobbler, tynker, and the smyth,
Their labor began to leave:
More gold to gain by phisykes art,
And therwyth did deceive.
So leapt forth Loy the loyterer,
That no man might him let,
To be a priest or mynister,
An idle gain to get.
With gold some bought their benefice
In hope more gold to reach:
Which to attain is all their cure,
For nothing else they preach.
Unlearned though they latin lap
Before the simple folcke,
As if a sow should spyn and twyst
Of from a lynn^n rock.
The bishops once confirmde in see,
Regarded idell thryft:
To preach or teach they took no care,
For gold was all their dryft.
The superstitious hipocrite,
Still held antiquity,
In hope to gain if change may hay
To build iniquity,
Each varlet in his bravery,
Affirm may what he list:
Yea openly against the laws,
They daily do resyst.
Thus gayn of gold has made the laws
Void, and of noue effect,
The godly preachers rayled on,
And their doctrine reject.
Thus is their gold or Mammon vsle
Their only lord and God:
For it they only seek and serve,
Though Christ have it forbod.
The laboryng man would for his pain,
Be wagde with double hyre,
Or else would loyter, and not work
At any man's desire.
For which at last some did pretend
To make a quick redres:
But all their deeds did rather turn
Unto double distres.
For as the common saying went,
Who so a tree would fell,
Hard to the root must put his axe,
If he will do it well:
And not begin small tops to shred,
And let the stock alone:
For so mo twygs will grow again,
^o thus did poor men groan.
The price of fermes must first fall down
Unto their ancient rate,
Or it is ye shall reform to right
No degree or estate.
If ye mean right, first ba^e the price
Of that which is your own:
So how to mende after that rate
Shall easyly be known.
But whylst your selves will not debate
Your rentes and gredy gain,
Your study of amendment
In others is but vain.
Of takers and commyssioners,
There might one see a sort,
For gain of gold begyle their prince
And his subjects extort.
Of all things would they double take,
And sell the resydue:
Thus both to prince and people to,
These wretches were untrue.
In like sort bayliffes played their part
In gettyng gold with wrong:
And somners which causde many one
To sing a sorry song.
These could make one write double seru^
As many mo as need:
And for a brybe the same discharge:
Thus falshode has decrede.
All merchants there me thought I saw
With many a subtle shyfte,
The gredy gain of gold to win,
By false and theuysh dryfte.
So saw I crafts men leave their art,
And fall to husbandry:
Leases over their neyghbors head,
To that intent they buy.
Which made the rent of lands to rise,
From five unto a score:
Such great enormitie as this,
Even Nature does abhore.
Unlawful gain and usury
That execrable use
I saw frequented commonly:
Which was a great abuse.
Right many heirs full rychely left
Were thereby clean undone,
By craft and guyle therein conteynd,
With craft thus have they done.
Some gafyng up upon the sterres,
With vain deludyng Iapes,
Deceived many simple folks,
And mocked them like apes.
Their learning in Astronomye,
Was scarsely worth a myte:
Although of it was all their boste
To blind the peoples sight.
The dyuels art they do frequent,
And therewith tell much news:
The christen flock thus they pervert,
With most hateful abuse.
For children now are scarsly borne
But straight they will apply,
Their goods to spend on such as bost
They can well domifye.
And calculate what shall become
Hereafter of that child:
With vanity for gain of gould
Thus was that place defylde.
When things were lost or stolue by thenes
These hypocrites did gase,
Upon the sterres, and sometimes told
That did the people mase.
For easy sure by such deceyght,
Among the people rude
It is, with counterfeatyng face,
Them to mock and delude.
And hateful wytches every where,
With hurtful words and charm,
Both men and cattle did destroy,
Committyng endless harm.
And this they did, that daily men
Might seek that trade unto:
The grysly grefes by wytches done,
By wytche craft to undo,
And in this wise some gained so,
That naught were worth of late,
That they could buy and trymly build,
At this present estate.
And some for gayn with the like arts,
Divine and prophecy,
And promise many things to come
By such falls treachery.
From crowned king to pesant poor,
No degree or estate,
Escape could, that they would not ^e,
With them vold to check mate.
Noble printes that diadem
And scepters justly hear,
To Judge their ends most hatefully,
These dyuels do not fear.
Such traiterous kind of prophesies,
Wherein they closely mell,
And daily do the same frequent,
A strange thing were to tell.
For which cause some by coniuryng,
The wicked spirits raise,
And trouble all the elements
In these most hateful days.
How they do offer sacrifice
Unto the fend of hell:
Sometime of their own flesh and blood
Which therefore they do quell.
And how they cast their souls away.
In most damnable wise,
By fellowship with damned sprites,
Is known unto the wise.
I saw also like fugitives,
Right many forth did straye,
With beastly gau^es and making shifts,
with fond and theuyshe play.
Of these many were Iuglers lewd,
And some had apes and bears,
And some had fo^^yshe puppet plays.
And thereby great gain reares.
Some throw ^ houpe would trimly dance,
And some with hoby nagge
For gain of gold would play trim tricks,
With turn round kycke and wag.
And many mynstreis there I saw,
Which money to attain,
For each man's fansy had a song,
Though they were naught and vain.
Yea popysh songs for popyshe folk,
And eke for men demure,
They would have songs that framed were
Out of the gospel pure.
And fylthy songs for fylthy folk,
That therein had delyght,
And gold to win they would not shun
To do all things unright.
And some again by palmestry,
Men's fortunes would disclose:
As beggars throng unto a dole,
So many went to those.
And gave them money liberally,
To tell them lying tales:
Of which these wreches have great store
When they undo their males.
To these vain women much resort,
The chief cause is to hear,
How many husbands they shall have
As it does often appear.
And rob their husbands on this ^ort
Such lewd men to reward:
So much to change and gayn thereby,
It seems they regard.
These knaves would whyster in their ears
And would dysclose each mark.
That on their bodies these folks had
In secret place or dark.
O mystresse ye have such a mol^
Or mark in such a place:
And such a wart I know it well
By lookyng on your face.
Upon your belly is a mark,
A wart upon your breast,
And on your foot a little mole,
(I know them most and lest.)
And more then this iwys I know,
If all I should you tell:
Then would ye blushe and be abasht,
Therefore I will not mell.
But will be sylent in all things,
Save that you do require,
In which I shall my mystresse fair,
Accomplish your desire.
Lo straight these folks are mad in lust
And most beastly affection,
To hear these lies of crafty thieves,
O most hateful infection.
How long shall such consumyng ^ot hes,
And hateful caterpyllers,
Be suffered thus ^o hurt and spyll,
The fruits of honest iyuers,
How long shall they be maynteyned,
And escape all punishment?
Such thieves I mean as gather gold,
By crafts that they invent.
From shyre to shyre, from town to town
And still from place to place,
These thieves did flecte vupunyshed,
And none did them deface.
The rabble rune of ruffyen roges,
Did furnyshe up the train
Of such as lyude by robbery,
Gold to get or obtaync.
Of these some cut the poor man's purfe,
An other does conuaye:
And worse then this they cut men's throtes
To get that wicked pray.
Some in a bushe would closely lurk
For this most fylthy gaynes,
And with a club most murderously,
Knock out the true man's brains.
But others in more stout order
In companyes would wayght,
Of such as travail by the way,
To make their golden bayght.
Stand says the thief, and straight his ma^e
Says, Deliver thy purse:
Lo thus they snatche that others get,
Among them to disburs.
There saw I also rat catchers,
And such as teethe did draw,
Like fugitives and vagabundes,
Contrary unto law.
Cloak over many shyftyng mates,
That live by rape and spoil.
Among that flock I you assure,
They kept a shameful coil:
And many with a pedlers pack*
To sell both pynnes and lace,
Resorted to each cockbeld fair:
Only but for a face.
To make folk think they come to sell,
Where they come but to steal:
What need I say, how hurtful these
Be to a common weal?
When some of these were spyde and take
And before Justice brought:
Then their most wonder was of all,
What wyckednes gold wrought.
For golden brybes there might a man
See false thieves let slyp go:
And where no gold was, pickery
Enough was them to sio.
Where gold hare rule wylful murder
Was made but chance medlye,
And chance ^^dlye was murder made:
Where gold was but skantye.
Thus life and death, yea yapne and ^ase.
Hong all on wicked mede:
For the attaynyng of the same,
All men's manners agrede.
For gredyly they gryped it.
By hook or crook each where:
And to be brie^e none other thing
Authority could bear.
For God nor king none did regard
In respect of the same:
And other end save only it,
Had neither work nor game.
For some there were with testyng tricks
That laughter could provoke:
And gold to gain with this their art,
They had a ready stroke.
Some were so vain to laugh at such
That measure clean they mys,
As though they had with myrre and wine
Drunk G^lothophilis.
Yea wise men would them surely d^^e
Clean gone beside their wyltes,
If they should see them gape and laugh,
And gygle so by fyttes.
Corn, lether, lead, wood, and falte hyd^^^
By stealthe some did conuaye,
For private gain they brake the laws,
To common wealths decay.
Such ways to win, and goulde to gayn,
No oaths but they were sworn:
Thus as they might the lord him self,
With oaths was all to torn.
Some by the foot, some by the hands
Some by the head, and heart:
Some by his guts, some by his ^yes,
Some by his death and sinarte.
Some by the faith they owe to God,
Would swear and falsely lie:
And some as God should be their judge,
Did use their falshode slye.
Each science eke in their degree,
I saw toss and turmoyle,
Falsely to win they counterfete,
In their travail and toil.
True workmanshyp was turnde to slyght,
With falshode to beguyle:
The trusty trade each man refusde
For gain of gold so dyle.
No man might at his* word be trust,
For under sugared talk,
Deceyt was meant and subtlety,
In falshode thus they walk.
Each man to his inferiou^
A cruel Cyclops seinde:
The great the small did quite confume,
Wherefore hell I it deinde.
With balance false, and weyghtes untrue
And measure of like cyfe,
Each one an other did deceive,
And truth all did despise.
The husbandman and other like,
Did benefyces buy:
Whereby the man should live that taught
The people faithfully.
So were the people all untaught,
And blyndly were they led,
Which made them irreligious,
For faith was from them fled.
Thus simony and sacrilege,
And all extortion,
Was laufull gayn, naught came amys,
That profit hanged on,
With color of symplicitie,
And feigned holiness.
Me thought I saw much gold was go^,
Oh woeful wyckednes.
False wytnes, whordome and excess
Were used for gayn of gold:
And finally all wickedness,
For lucre was extolde.
Great murder, theft, and robbery,
This gredy hunger bred:
Rauyn, dysdeyne, and periurye,
For gold was committed.
I well perc^^^^ ^^ kind of folk^,
There were, but all were bent
To brybe^ and to unlawful gain,
With most wicked intent.
What shall I say, if I should her^
Their whole deceytes rehearse?
An huge long book I might well ^yll,
With this my ragged verse.
If some of them in their desire,
Their gredy wyshe might have,
All that they touch should turn to gould,
As Midas once did crave.
Who sterued had because his meat,
Did all to gold convert,
If Bacchus had not then wytsaft
That sentence to reuert.
Who taught him then for remedy,
Pactolus to wash in,
Which is a stream in Lydia,
With golden gravel fine.
I musyng much at their vsance,
It caused me to fear,
(Their mynds so beastly semde to be)
That Ci^ce had been there.
Who ^eygned was, that she by craft
Of sorcerye could change,
Both forms and minds of me^ to beasts
Which was a matter strange.
For never tygre was more fierce,
Then some did there appear,
No swyne so fylthy nor so drunk,
Nor glutton nothing nere.
In lechery they pass the Goat,
And in their pompous pride:
The Lion stout they much excede
And that on every side.
The subtle fox, the rauenyng wolf,
The enuyous serpent,
The gredy Gryppe, the hasty Hounde,
His game that feign would hent,
The cruel bear, the foolyshe ass,
The harmefull mockyng ape,
The gryffon, or the Antilope.
Or Bygorne that does gape.
The goryng Bull, the buttyng ramm^
The scratchyng cat with clawe,
In beastly ac^es may not compare,
With those that there I saw.
O God (quod I) what place is this?
Is hell more odious?
My heart in great perplexity,
My clamor made I thus.
Ye Muses nine my comfort sweet,
Take pity and draw nere,
Coequally by one consent,
Let come Arete dear.
That she this doubt may me dissolve,
And that she may me learn,
How I may know what place is this,
And all this folk decerne.
Of mercy oh my dear delyght,
Arete I thee call:
Approach unto thy servant poor,
Or peryshe else I shall.
O dulcet dear Arete fair,
Thy pro^ys now fulfill,
With me made when that I me bound
To serve thee at thy will.
With this me thought a thunder clay
Made all the earth to shake:
That I ab^sht and much afraid
Did tremble sore and quake.
Wherewith me thought Arete bright,
From heaven did descend:
As swyft as is the arrow flight,
The air can she rende,
My servant dear quod she to me,
What hap is thee befall,
That thou in such lamentyng wise
To me dydst cry and call?
Was Satan like to vanquyshe thee,
Or drive thee to despair?
Or what might cause thy voice so shrill
Thus to deuyde the air?
My dyamonde most dear, quod I,
Mine only lust and will,
Is that thou lose me from this doubt,
Through openyng of my skyll.
What name might have this present hill
Where desolate I stand?
What kind of folk are they allow,
And of what uncouth land?
That valey low should seem to be,
Some vile unhappy soil:
What hill is this, where thought so strange
My mind does thus turmoyle?
The hill (quod she) that thou art on,
Is an high divine mind,
From which all worldly wyckednes,
Is separate by kind.
And as each thing by contraryes,
I^ best known and decernde:
So on this hylle the vile estate
Of worldlynges low are lernde.
The children of this wretched world,
Be those in yonder vale,
Which gredyly do pain them selves,
In sekyng paynfull vale.
Know they not God (quod I,) nor do
They nothing fear his force?
No not all (quod she no more
Then does the mule or horse.
They fear God as the dyutis fear,
But faith or love is none:
Philargery they only serve,
And set their minds upon.
Who as the poets have feynd does li^^
By fedyng still of gold:
And therewith never satisfied
He wastes manyfolde.
Although he daily do consume,
And ever still devour:
Yet craves on his clyents still
To feed him every hour.
Whose labor ^ke is infinite,
Their hunger has no ho
Abundance can not slake their thyrst,
So wicked is their woe.
With having is not satisfied,
The heart of auaryce:
For as the riches does increase,
So does the couetyse.
A hell without all order is,
That realm where such do won,
A flock of folk ungodly vent,
In sinful paths to run.
A pack of people sekyng gain,
And private welthe prefer:
And common wealth does none seek for,
But each does it hinder.
Each man is there all for him self,
The dyuell is for all:
His kingdom only do they seek,
And thither shall they fall.
Saint Paul has called couetyse
The only root of sin:
How then can those men be but ill,
That walk so far therein?
So unrepentant is their hearts,
As hard as any flynt:
Naught can resolve or moll^ye,
Or make them once to stynt.
Great tokens from the Lord above,
Right many ha^h ben sent,
At London, and at Hungerforde,
And in some place of Rent.
The elements to repentance,
With diverse tokens calls,
As has been ^ene, when fire consumde
The piramid of Paul's.
And other places have well felt
Their rage, whom I not name:
Yet se we few whose hearts relent,
Or repent by the same.
Which manyfestly does declare,
That greater plagues then those,
God has preparde and ready bent,
For to consume his foes.
So little faith is found on earth,
Which shows certainly,
That the last day is not far hence,
But will come suddenly.
Which reprobates most damnable,
Have cause to doubt and fear:
But Gods elect do daily wysh^
To see the same appear.
Farewell (quod she) I must depart,
I have done thy request:
As swyft as thought she perst the clouds
To win eternal rest.
And I with care for her absence,
And sodeyne presence change,
A woke from sieape, much meruaylyng
At this my sweuen strange.
A Poesis in sorme of a Visyon, briefly inueying against the most hate full and
prodigious Ar^es of Necromancie, Wytchcraft, sorcery, Incantations, and diverse
other detestable and dyuely she practis^s, daily used under color of Judicial
Astrology.
FRom out the Ramm^ into the Bull
As Titan last began crall:
By order in his endless pathe.
Ecliptike that men call.
Which pathe does so the z^diak,
Just in the myddest deuyde:
That six degrees thereof are found,
From it on every side.
When day was fled, and night in plate
As was natures request:
I went to bed full hopyng there,
To take some quiet rest.
Which long before I lacked so
Through trouble of mine heart,
That thus I made my playnt to God
Who only knew my smart.
Almighty Jove, grant now that I.
With sleep this night begyle:
As did Ulysses, when from care.
He ^ased was a while.
When most friendly Alcinous,
Good king of Phaeacea,
Him sent in ship till he sayid home
To his own Ithaca.
Who slcapyng still was from the ship
Laid forth upon the (...):
Which when he woke, what place it wa^
Did nothing understand.
Until Minerua him informde,
And gave him perfect view:
How soon he might in presence be
Of Penelope true,
His wife most chaste which fortune strange
To his great grief of mind:
By diverse luck, long time with held,
In Homer as we synde.
But Philomela busyly,
Recorded so her song:
That all my shyf^es could wyn no slep^,
That would continue long.
For as they feyne the thorn so sharp,
Did seem to touch her breast,
For her shryll notes so perst mine ears,
That long I could not rest.
Yet in short slepes such dreadful dremes
I began to think and met:
That when I wakt beside my wit
It had me almost set.
Me thought I did in meadows walk
For my sport and solas:
Where sylu^r drops of dew most sweet
Did cleave to every grass.
Whereby there ran and tyuer fair,
With streams so Crystal clear:
That at the bothom might be seen
The pe^l^ stones appear.
Above the meadow was a rock,
And on that rock a wood:
From which ran many pleasant springs
Into that river good.
Crossyng the medes, they trickled down
As life blood in the veins
Does from the heart till each member
Comfort thereby atteynes.
Above this woddy rock there was
A Field most pleasant grene:
Where the beauty of natures works
Right aptly might be seen.
There was no her be nor pleasant flower
In such a Fyeld to know:
But might be seen most fruitfully
Within this field to grow.
What should I name the Hyacinthe,
Or soote Verbasculy:
The Clouer sweet of diverse kinds,
That caulde are trifoly.
The Brunell and the Bugle blewe,
With fair Hieracium:
The Synkfoyle and the Betony,
And sweet Origanum.
The Tutsane and Hipericon,
Asciron, and Paunsye:
The Vyolet and Simphiton.
And the doubt Daysye.
The Haries ease, and the Paciente,
And crimsen Pimpernell,
The Cammocke, and the Camomille,
And Canterbury bell.
Rosecampany, Maudlen, and Cost,
And London touft so red:
Agrimony and Lions tooth,
That Children call Pysbed.
Odoriferous Serpillum,
And lady Traces fine:
With Yarow, Torn twyse, Strawberyes,
And Burnet good with wine.
The Lunary, the Serpents tongue,
And Procerpinaca:
The Adder grass, the Saxifrage,
And eke Veronica.
It hedged was with H^nysutkes,
Or periclimenum:
Well myxed with small Co^nus trees,
Sweet bryer, and Ligustrum.
The white thorn, and the black^ thorn both,
With box, and maple fine:
In which br^u^^^ed the Bri^ny,
The Iuy, and wild vine.
To long I should the time detr^^^
And from my purpose str^y:
If I should ^ecken all the things
Within the Field so gay.
Beside the good prospect for those,
That know Astronomy:
I think no platform in the world,
Where one might more aptly.
The rysyng see, and settynges both,
That Cosmike have to name:
Acronyke to, and Helyak,
Of stars of noble fame.
About our Artick pole ye might
The little Bear first see:
That called are, the guardes of those
That cunnyng sailors be.
The great Bear also in the which
Charles wayne appears stout:
Which with the small Bear evermore,
Does walk the pole about.
Which Bears the Dragon does inuolue,
Then Boots, and the North Crown:
And after knelynge Hercules,
Is seen with great renown.
Harp, falling gryp, goat, swan, and he
That use to drive the cart:
The man that does the serpent bear,
The Egle and the dart.
Dolphin, forthers, and the other horse
That flies caulde pegasus:
The tryangle, and Androwede,
As some men do discuss.
The zodiake with his.xii. signs
Where Planets have their way:
With all aspects that may bechance
To any, night or day.
The Bulls eye, with the rest of sterres,
That caulde are Hyades*
Might there be sent with the brood hen,
That some name Pleiades.
The Manger and the Asses twain,
The Lions heart, and tail:
The virgins spyke, the scorpyons heart
And Water pot all hayle.
Whale, Oryon, and Golden yard,
That ladies Elle some call:
The river, hare, and both the dogs,
As well the great as small.
The serpent of the southe, the Cup,
The Raven, and Centaure:
The Centaures spear, and then the wolf
And also the altar.
The South crown also may be sen^,
With many other there,
As Tricars Constellation,
Or ^erenices hear.
The ship that Argo poets do name,
There might a man behold:
And many mo then I can name,
An hundred thousand fold.
There might ye see ascensions,
Both oblique and right:
No secrets of Astron^mye,
That were not there in sight.
And to be brief it was the joy,
Of Lady Vranie
Wherein to walk she did frequent
With all her famylie.
But as I clymed up the rock,
As I had often before:
Of that sweet field to take the air
Which does man's sprites restore.
I met a m^n in garments long
Most decent to behold:
His long beard gray, so was his head
Which did declare him old.
His countenance in sobernes,
All others did excel:
His gate and g^sture semd enough
All vices to expel.
For from the rule of honestye,
In him was nothing seen:
His outward works did explicate,
An inward conscience clean.
He took me by the hand, and said,
Dear friend how far away?
To yonder field father (I said)
A while my self to play.
My friend alas (quod he) bewar^
How ye henceforth come there:
It will you else in hell confound,
Therefore I say forbear.
What is your name my father fair,
(Said I) do it disclose:
Theologus I am (quod he)
With thee I will not gloss.
Why then (said I) do ye me warn,
From yonder pleasant place?
Because (quod he) it late receaude
A chance of great disgrace.
How so (said I^ then hark (quod he)
I do not use to lie:
I will the sh^we how it befell,
And that right orderly.
A Heron foul, that hunger gutte,
Of all fowls at his food:
Most ravenous, insaciate.
And of most gredy mood.
Hard by the doleful banks of Styx,
That foul infernal flood,
To fill his gut, or take his pray,
Still watchyng late he stood.
Where at the last, a serpent young,
Of Plutos hateful kind,
Came craulyng out, which gredy gut
Could very quickly find.
And thynkyng it had been an ^ele,
He cobde him up at ones:
And with that pray away he flewe
And made thereof no bones.
Which crepyng in his belly, did
To him such extreme pain,
Till in this Field at last he light,
Thynkyng there to remain.
And forth with at his fundament,
Put forth his for said meat,
Thynkyng as he was wont with ecl^s
The same again to eat.
But being quy^ke, the serpent straight,
Did crepe among the grass,
Which long neck ^ould no more espy,
N^ yet find where she was.
Wherefore to Styx he went again,
And likewise swalowed mo,
And to this Field still took his flight,
And there did let them go.
Till he at last so many brought,
Through this his frequent use,
That now this Field is marred quight,
Through most hateful abuse.
And such a number of serpents
In it do daily breed,
Which on these herbs and pleasant gras,
Continually do feed.
That now it is not only robde
Of every pleasant flower,
But hateful stynche may there be fel^
At every time and hour.
And Vranie has it forsook,
With wholesome pleasant showers:
And natural Astronomy,
With all her fauoroures.
And true Phisyke forsakes it to,
For why, clouds infernal,
Are daily blown from Lethes flood
To water it wythall.
Which causes nothing there to grow
But Superstition:
Of learning pure, and science good
The vile oblivion.
Astrologye Judicial.
Therefore does it possess:
Which is a strumpet counterfeit.
And yet nevertheless,
Because some learned men to hy^
Do cast their minds and love:
That she is true Astronomy,
Right many she does move.
And under color of that name
They use Necromancye:
With hateful incantations,
And vile Geomancye.
Of Magikes arts there are great store,
And Augures art pe rdye:
Foredemyng as Aruspices,
And some as Pyrethi.
All wytchecrafte vile, and Sor^ery,
Of false phytonicus,
Although they give themselves the name
Of grave Philonicus.
These are the fruits of phlegiae,
Or Satan's wicked brood,
That in this Fyeld the Heron shy^
To ease him when he stood.
Alas, (quod I) has this unclean
And hateful bird done so:
And natures dearlyng thus defa^t?
To him Vae, Vae, woe woe.
Then am I of my fantasy,
And my pleasant delyght:
And wholesome recreation
Robde, and depryued quyght.
With hangyng head, and bathfull face
I turned back again,
For grayberds counsel durst I no^
Refuse or once dysdayne.
But with most lowly reverence,
With thanks and condign praise,
I served him, when as we went
Each one his sundry ways.
But sorrowful syghyng I,
Went with my sorry news,
Enformyng my famyliar friends
With whom I did peruse
My study small, wherwyth I do^
My wit still occupy,
And do with them communicat^
My mind continually.
Of which some did sorowfully
With me this chance lament,
And other some would not believe,
But to the place they went.
Nor would not here Theologus
That friendly did them warn:
But needs would go presumptuously,
The matter to decearne.
Which has them so infected now,
And that most diuelyshly:
They are content to grant it still
To be Astronomye.
And necessary will it call,
Though by the devils work,
Under cloak of Astronomye,
These foul false faytors lork^.
So I be help of grief (say they)
Or find that which I lost:
Or know my desteny to come,
Why should I count it cost?
God would not suffer (other said)
Such things for to be wrought:
If he did not allow the same,
Or knew it to be naught.
It is a good work (other said)
Men to health to restore:
Although it be by dyuels work,
What need I pass therefore?
To help a true man to his goods,
Whereof he was depryude,
By falls thieves and vile barators,
That wrongly it atchieude.
It can not be but a good work,
Thus beastly men and fond,
Do answer them that would instruct
Or make them understand.
Not regardyng the law of God,
Nor his commanndement:
That no ill thing ought to be dove,
Upon a good intent.
Also if Gods permission,
Were a laufull defense.
So were it for all kind of sin,
And most wicked offense.
As whoredom, homicide and theft,
With vile I dolat^y:
For treason, couetyse, and pride,
And most vile simony.
May I not say, all these be good.
Sithe God does them permyt:
As well as those whom ye defend.
Oh men of beastly wit:
His sufferance is to let your synn^
Unto full rypenes grow:
That in the lake of sulphur he
Most justly may you throw.
And so declare his glory great
Unto his flock elect:
That do by grace these wicked arts
Clean from their hearts reject.
Their counsels all at God they ask,
And do at him require,
Their saving health, and he does give
To them their whole desire.
For why one hear shall never fall
From of their heads no time
Without his will, which does impute,
To them no sin nor crime.
For why they ask in lively ^ayth
All whereof they have need:
Which causes them assuredly*
Of their purpose to speed.
Therefore it must of force proceed,
Of Infidelity:
That ye at dyuels seek such help
Through most vyie sorcery.
As did king Saul that damned man,
When Gods sprite him forsook:
When God would him no answer make
For wytchecraft began he look.
Which faithles shift, how much it did
Him in his need avail
Did well appear: he slew him self
When foes did him assail.
And so do ye your selves declare,
Of that same very sect:
While ye at Satan seek your help,
And do Gods power suspect.
For as to dyuels here ye sought,
As reprobates forelorne:
So shall ye be his portion,
Sith God ye have forswortie.
Unless in time ye may repent,
Which if it be gods will,
He grant ye all that ye may hate,
And shonny she this great ill.
For though on prudent Solomon
They father this their art:
They are the works of wickedness,
And of eternal smart
The very cause: for why saint John
As God did him reveal,
Has found their place to be in hell,
Where torments are each deal.
Confounded are these coniurers
With conscience unclean:
And all that unto sorcery,
Or wicked wytchecraft lean^.
For in their art they do no dout,
The living God forsake:
Cleauyng to condemnation,
And thereof hold do take.
What need I here recyte scripture,
Sith all men well do know:
That god so deadly does it hate,
That neither high nor low.
The same may use, but that it will
To Satan his soul give:
Or if Gods law observed were,
Not one of them should live
That charmers are, or coniurers,
With wytches sorcery:
Or such as chosers are of days,
Markyng the birds that slye.
For why the faithful that do fear
God ryghtly and believe,
Assuredly do know that no
Such thing can once them grieve,
And as for that Astrology,
Judicial that ye name:
Let learned Calvin satisfy,
All wise men of the same,
But Phisike and Astronomy,
Alas is now the cloak,
For every kind of tr^chery,
That goodness does revoke.
For wicked wandryng fugitives
Or vagabundes most l^wde:
Do now a days from shyre to shyr^,
With shyftes both false and shrew^^.
Under color of Phisikes art,
And noble Surgery,
D^lude the common multitude
With shameful sorcery.
All secret marks they will disclose,
And things long done and paste:
Which does with admiration
The people make aghast.
In such wise, that they straight believe
That nothing under son,
Does stand to hard or difficill,
Of such men to be done.
So that partly with Palmestry,
Or Chyromancies gaude:
And foolysh Physiognomye,
And wytchery that fraud.
Unto their wicked false purpose,
The people they allure:
More then can any godly art,
That perfect is and pure.
For Bedlem baudes, and hateful hoores
This is a common shyft:
Of ruffyen thieves and murderers
It also is the dryft.
Under such cloak their companies
Together often they draw:
Free from danger of officers,
And punyshement of law.
Alas that this might be seen to
With Justice, power, and might,
That Vranie and Medicine,
Again might have their right.
That now is by extorcion,
So fraudulently kept:
That for most true possession^rs
The most part them accept.
For how their Field was put them fro
Before I have you said:
Desyryng now all learned men
In this to add their aid.
That from the fylthy fruits of hell
It may once be purged:
That there the right inheritours
Again might be lodged.
That now be feign to seek else where,
Some wholesome place to dwell:
Where of the wise they are accept
And entertained well.
Among these thoughts most troublesome,
At last I did awake:
Fyndyng my body sweatyng sore,
And all my synewes shake.
Where I long time lay syghyng sore,
Thynkyng of this strange dream:
Wyshyng for some interpretour
If any in this Realm
Were full expert therein as was
Ferdinand Ponzetus:
Or Artemidor, whose syrname
Is said Daldianus.
But as each thing does wear by time
So other thoughts at last,
Abated this perplexity,
And it began to wast.
And I again came to my self,
That I did shortly hear:
The warbiyng notes and song so sweet,
Of Philomela clear.
Which counsayld me that slouthfulnes
I should from me expel:
Wherefore I rose, and with all speed,
I lyghted a candell.
So serude my turn my tynder box,
Which stood in my chamber:
Then took I forth my standyshe to,
With pen, ynke, and paper.
Where I carude forth ill fauoredly
This rough and ragged verse:
Wherein theffect of this my dream,
I ^udely do rehearse.
Desyryng yet my readers dear,
To bear^ it patiently:
Sith it is but the buddyng flower,
Of my poor infancy.
Which as rypenes of knowledge grows
I shallbe glad tamend:
If any man shall me inform,
And thus I make an end.
Esaias. 1^. When they ask council at their Gods, at their Prophets, at their
Sothsayers and Witches, the^ will I bring their counsels to naught.


Hieremie. 10. Ye shall not learn after the manner of the heathen, and ye shall
not fear the tokens of heaven: for the heathen are afraid of such. yea all the

Esaias. 47. Go now to thy coniurers, and to the multitude of thy wytches, whom
thou have ben acquaynted with all from thy youth, if they may hear thee or
strengthen thee: Thou have hitherto had many counsels of them. So let the
heaven gasers and beholders of stars, come on now and deliver thee: yea and
let them show, when these new things shall come upon thee. Behold they shall be
like straw, which if it be kyndied with fire, no man may rid it for the
vehemence of the flame. And yet it gives no synders to warm a man by, nor
clear fire to sit by. Eue^ so shall they be whom from thy youth thou have
frequented. Every one shall show thee his erroneous way, yet shall none of
them defend thee.


A Ditie declaryng the risyng and setting of the.xii. signs of the zodiake:
one always opposite and going down at the same instant that an other ryseth.
THe Signs do rise and set
At just instant of time,
Each hydyng him self when
His opposyt does clyme.
For why the Ram so soon,
Appears not in the east,
But straight the balance be
Gone down then in the west.
The Scorpion rysyng,
The Bull even then does fall:
When twynnes come, the Arche^,
On the other side the Ball
Does pass from us, and so
The Crabbe and Goat likewise
The Lion and the Water pot,
Each fall when the other rise,
The Vyrgin in the east,
No sooner shows her face,
But in Weste the Fyshes
Them hyde, and so give place,
Thus in like order as
One in East does appear,
The Opposite sign then,
Abstaynes from tarying here.
Ne yet can one of them
Declare him self so bold,
Above the Horizon,
His contrary behold.
A Ditie made to the praise of God, by the Author, for a pacient to use after
health attained, who contrary to all men's expectation, was in his hands by the
goodness of God cured.
Sing this as, Of Ielousye who so will hear.
O Loving God and mighty Lord,
My maker and my governor,
My mouth and heart shall now accord,
Thee to worship laud and honor.
As Moses sung thy laud and praise,
When through the red sea he had past,
And Pharao drownde as Scripture says,
As he pursude thy people fast.
In many Psalms as David did
That kyngly Prophet praise thy name:
When out of sorrows he was ryd,
He sung thy praises for the same.
As did good king Ezechias,
When thou dydst him to health restore,
Making him whole as erst he was,
To live yet full fyftene years more.
As Jonas brought from point of death,
Him self adressed by and by,
As soon as he could draw his breathe
Thy holy name to magnify.
And as thy Prophet Daniell,
From lions mouth delivered,
For joy thy praise and power did tell,
And Darius the worshipped.
So do I wretched sinner now,
Having a cause as great as those,
In this case execute my vow,
Thy mercyes great Lord to disclose.
Thou bryngest down to depth of woe,
Such as thou myndest to correct,
And yet thou doste not leave them so,
But doste to knowledge them direct.
As connyes mine, and their holes make,
In banks where they delyght to bread,
Like order did my sycknes take,
Within my flesh so did it feed.
Till at last I was consumed,
And nothing left but bone and skin.
My synncwes shrunk, my veins were fled,
Not once possible to be seen.
Incredible was my weakness,
Consumed clean with pain and grief,
But in greatest of my dystres,
Thy grace was sent to my relief.
Wherefore while breath within my breast,
May move, I shall thy praise declare:
And will show forth to most and least,
How sweet thy grace and mercies are.
And how at need thou art hand
To help all that in thee do trust,
And make us to understand.
How faithful thou art and how just.
My holowe caves are fyllde again,
Those runnyngsores are whole and dry.
And I in ease ryd out of pain,
In health and strength right perfectly.
All honor praise and great glory.
To thee therefore I still shall give:
And will not put from memory,
Thy grace and mercyes while I live.
But will all other folk exhort,
By all occasyons as I may:
To trust in thee, to their comfort,
And faithfully move them to pray.
All honor therefore I render
To thee God, that of might have most,
O Father with thy son so dear,
And also to the holy ghost.
As has been is and shall be still,
To world of worlds for evermore,
Where angels ever with good will,
Do praise thee still out of their stor^.
An other Ditie to the same purpose and use.
IF any man front woe,
And pain restorde to ease,
When grief is gone him fro,
With sycknesse and disease,
Have cause with praise,
To laud thy name,
And show the same,
With thanks always.
Then I most wretched wight,
Of all folk most am bound,
To cause both day and night,
His praises to abound,
Which at this day,
Have had relief
From all my grief,
Wherein I lay.
My pynyng pain and sore
Incomparable was,
As beasts in pain do rore,
So did I wretch alas:
Almost till death,
Would me have caught,
At me he raught,
To stop my breath.
For as a carkas dead,
I lay in woe and care:
I could not eat my bread,
So faint was I and bare:
But now behold,
How God my Lord,
Has me restorde,
A thousand fold.
For where before his rod
I careless was and wild,
Forgettyng my sweet God,
With all his mercies myld
I now am taught,
To praise his power,
And keep each hour
The same in thought.
Thus may we daily see,
He scurgeth us for love,
True christians to be,
His mercy does us move,
And ever still,
Does us procure,
Ay to endure,
To do his will.
Wherefore I will not cease,
On earth here while I dwell,
His kyndnes to rehearse,
And of his mercyes tell:
And how that he,
When hope was past,
Yet at the last,
Restored me.
All godly men therefore,
That in him hope and trust,
Praise him with all honor,
For he is true and just,
And will not mysse
To help at need,
And that with speed,
All that are his.
Se that both day and night,
Whether ye work or rest,
Ye praise him for his might,
All creatures most and least:
Whether ye play,
Lie down or rise,
Still exercise,
His praise always.
Whether ye sit or stand,
Whether ye ride or go,
On sea or on the land
What so ever ye do.
Whether therefore,
Ye drink or eat
After your meat
And eke before
All honor to him give,
For he us wrought and made,
And causes us to live,
Each ereature in his trade:
And does govern,
As shypmayster,
Does guide and stere,
His ship with stern.
With all our might and strength,
Let us him magnify,
Which saves all at length,
That love him faithfully:
Wherefore all thing,
With heart and voice,
In him rejoice,
And this wise sing.
Glory to the father,
God that of might has most,
And to the son so dear,
And to the holy ghost:
As has been y^re,
Is and still shall
Be over all,
For evermore.
Amen.
A ditie to be sung of musiciens in the morning, at their lord or masters
chamber door, orels where of him to be heard.
^ THe hauning day begins to glare,
^ And Lucifer does shine on hie:
^ And says that Phoebus does prepare,
^ To show him self immediately.
And the most dark tenebrous night,
Is feign to flee and turn her back,
Which can in no wise bbyde the light.
But bears away her mantle black.
Wherefore in time let us arise,
And slouthfulnes do clean away:
Doing some godly exercise,
As servants true while it is day.
Let us in no wise time abuse,
Which is gods creature excellent,
All slothful sleep let us refuse,
To virtuous works let us be beat.
Let us commyt our selves to Christ
With thanks and praise him first to serve
Which does out deadly foes resyst,
And from all dangers us preserve.
And then this type se that you mind,
That like as you in night do rest:
And in the morning your selves find,
Awake and ready to be breast.
So shall our bodies sleep by death,
And after be to life restorde,
When Christ shall come and restore breath,
And Judge us all as says his word.
Then mekely let us him desire,
That it may be his blessed will,
That we this day may well aspire,
By grace his service to fulfill.
So that we may do hurt to none,
Nor of none other hurt receive
But still be kept by Christ alone,
That Satan never us deceive.
But still in christen godlynes,
By grace we may our selves prepare,
Of all offense and wyckednes,
For to escape the net or snate.
This grant us Lord omnipotent,
For Christ his sake our mercy seat,
That we may taste joys permanent,
Before thy throne of glory great.
Amen.
A ditie to be sung at night when men go to bed. Sing this as, In summer time
when flowers began spryng. etc.
Now that the day is wasted clean,
And Phoebus does him self absent,
And Hesperus does downward lean:
And lurkyng night with darkness bent,
Her mantle dark abroad to spread,
And hyde from us the welkyn clear,
The stars also are prepared,
With glystryng light now to appear.
Therefore of force we must needs yield
In bed to sleep and take our rest:
Forsakyng clean both street and field,
And other works both most and least.
Wherefore to Christ now let us call,
In this our need us to assist,
From dread and fear and dangers all,
Defend our sely souls O Christ.
O Lord defend us with thy grace,
In this our need when we do sleep,
Sith we are able at no space,
Ourselves from dangers small to keep,
O Lord that still have wakyng eyes,
And know no sleep nor felest night,
Out humble suit do not despise,
But us defend now by thy might.
Defend us with thy grace and power
To help our selves sith we ne can,
Nor have no strength at any hour,
The same to do so weak is man.
O let thy power out feebleness,
With help of grace this night supply,
O way our myserablenes,
And comfort us with thy mercy.
O let us then with mind contrit
With praise and prayer to Jesus,
Lie down to rest, and so commyt
Our selves to him that saves us.
O Lord forgive us all our sin,
And plant true faith within our breast
And after cares that we are in,
Let us ones taste eternal rest.
Amen.
A ditie to be sung at dinner time and meals.
Sing this as, If truth may take no trusty hold. etc.
AS root of tree does of the ground,
Take moisture named radical,
And causes branches to abound,
With that he geues them over all.
And suffers no small twyg to want,
But naturally does dispose
Such as he has plenty or scant,
Unto the nutriment of those.
As Nature by this industry.
Does cause things vegitall to grow,
In other sort she does apply
On animals good to bestow.
Among the which we men mortal,
That formed are to Gods Image:
With meat and drink nutrimentall,
We maintaynde are from age to age.
The mighty maker of all things.
His creatures leaves not destitute.
An that they have is his geuyng,
As well to man as beasts brute.
Lest therefore we appear unkind,
Unto this God that all does send,
To praise his name with thankful mind
And gratfull hearts now let us bend.
Let us not one morcell receive,
With forgetful ingratitude:
Least to our own lusts god us leave,
More wretched then brute beasts rude.
Ne yet let us in any wise.
Forget the nedy brethern poor,
The sick and lame do not despise,
Nor him that goes from door to door,
For God has made us ministers,
That one an others need should serve,
Wherefore we are but murderers,
If in our fault our neighbors sterue.
And may be to that dog comparde,
That lay upon an heap of hay.
Spying the ox come thitherward^,
With barkyng drove the same away.
Which needs must be churly she envy
Sith he him self no hay could eat,
To stand at baye so frowerdly,
And keep the poor ox from his meat.
Let us therefore do otherwise,
And from our bellies somewhat spare,
In love to show some exercise,
To brethern poor that nedy are.
For who so to the poor does give
Does lend to God on usury,
And shall receive for his releue,
Great gain again abundantly.
To him therefore most gratefully,
Give honor glory thanks and praise,
To him as one in Trinity,
All honor be now and all ways.
An other to the same purpose.
Sing this as, Hear out O Lord the right request. etc.
When ye take food at any time,
Your bodies to refreshe with ought
Remember Gods infynite power
Which all has made and formde of naught,
Remember eke his prudent reygne,
His mercy and benignity,
Who all his works does aye sustain,
And govern still continually.
And consequently call to mind,
His clemency and great mekenes,
Which all creatures does feed and find,
Yea his most foes in their dystresse.
Pander also the great marvel,
How many great gifts he ordeynes,
Sufficient food and all victayle,
For all that this whole world conteines.
Have mind how fast we do declyn^e,
How apt we are still to decay,
Which only he by power divine,
Preserues else were we gone away.
No man's wysedom nor angel bright,
Were able this to take in hand,
In any wise: or thing more light,
The way how once to understand
Sithe of his gifts therefore we live
Were it not cursed unkindness,
That we due praise should him not give?
Oh hateful vile unthankfulness.
At thy table let soberness,
And wisdom be with talk most chaste
Myndyng still his pure holiness,
Whose gifts this time in hand thou have
Let bitter words and backbytyng
From thy table secluded be,
His love to thee rememberyng
Whole kyndnes is great toward thee.
This place therefore contaminate,
Not, with dysprayse of any man,
Sith thou feciste here for thine estate,
Gods favor, that no wight want can.
Let therefore here no hate appear,
Where God so greatly shows his love,
But rather love thy brother dear,
As gods great gifts here do the move.
Lord grant us grace for evermore,
That we thy mercyes so much mind,
That hatred our hearts may abhore,
And never show our selves unkind.
Amen.
An other grace.
ALl folk that live in lively faith,
Confess with one accord,
That all creatures are fed of God,
And praise therefore the Lord.
Lest then we show ingratitude
And mere unthankfulness,
By law of love graft in our hearts,
Let us our faith express.
And praise the Lord for this our food
Here present to us sent,
And for our health which he to us
Mercyfully has lent.
And for his word to feed our souls,
We also ought to pray:
So shall we never dye, but live
With God in bliss for aye.
Through Christ his death, who in this world
Did take our flesh therefore:
To whom be honor, praise and laud,
Both now and evermore.
Amen.
A sonnet inueyinge against the abuses and pride that reyg^^th among vain
women.
YE women and maids of City and country,
Leave your leude lightness, learn some honesty
If an of you the truth will regard,
Spoke with simplicity, let it be heard.
And hear not only, but follow the same,
Lest God discover you to your great shame.
Remember your sins, and rufully rue,
Lest after this barker a byter insuc.
In Esaias the prophet there may you find,
The plages yt for proud women God has assignde
The daughters of Syon (says he in that place)
Do tryp on their toes, with counterfayt pace,
With stretched out necks, and nyce wanton ^ies
But now will I plage them for their proud gu^se
They would not my voice here when that I called,
Therefore for fair hear they now shall be bald.
For gyrdles of gold, they shall have lose bands,
Their husbands shall fall in thene^ies hands.
Their beauty shall fade, and they shall wax du^ne,
Their faces shall wyther, all burnt with sun.
Instead of gay stomachers that they now wear
They shall wear sackloth in great dread and fear.
Their brooches and ouches and garlandes gay.
Their partlets and pynnes I will take away.
Their hooks and hedba^ds wherein they delight.
Hearlace and fyllets their heads with to dyght,
Perles and precious stones, gold wroght by ma^s ar^
Gold rings and jewels, whereon was their heart.
Their spa^gs and their chains, their coll^^s and hooues,
Their vales and their glasses, and their gay gloves,
Bonets and taches, and slyppers so thyn,
Setting forth beauty, and showing whyteskyn.
Their smockes, their kerchers, and bracelets also,
And every thing else I will take them fro.
And for the sweet smell that they do now use,
They shall have stynkyng that all men refuse.
For their great riches and raiment costly,
They shall be naked and in poverty.
But lest ye should thynk this is but my mind,
Read Esaias the third, and there shall ye find.
Whether that your life from virtue rebel,
Or if it accord to Christ his gospel.
For I can not think but then ye shall see,
That ten times as proud as they were you be:
For which ye deserve (ye can not deney)
To be plagued ten times as much as they.
For Christ in the Gospel plainly discust,
Who so does a woman s^e, and does he lust.
Has presently in adultery done sin.
Then woe be to such as train men therein.
For if a man's eyes to lust do him move,
The woman does cause it, as I can prove.
For Christ in the gospel also does say,
Offenses must needs be, this is no nay,
But woe be to them, through who^ they be brought,
That is to say, such as make men do naught.
Let women in haet then ryghtly record,
If they cause not men to offend the Lord:
Which all their whole life for naught else provide
But paynt out them selves of men to be spyde.
As men are adulterers, so are they whores,
That these wais men's souls consumes and deuoures
If they commyt sin that do but desire,
Much more do those women through their attire.
Which curlyng their hear, and painting their face
Tempt and entice men, vain love to embrace,
To daly and dance, such women delyght,
Inuentyng new tricks, from morning to night:
In pastyme and play their pleasure still is,
And all the long day to clyp and kiss.
No good will such do within or without,
But dasse on their tail, and prick through a clout.
And some to be small, so streyneth their lace,
That they clean deprive from color their face
The right course of blood, so stoppyng wythall,
That often they faint, and to the ground fall.
Yet though their small wast full often make the^ swou^d
Their froks must have buttocks most mo^strously round
Like dancyng gyantes they go in the street,
As though their hung houpes about their fine fete
That Solomon says right true still is it,
That recheles women do by the way sit,
For such as go by, they still do prepare,
The unwise to snarle in their wicked snare.
For women and maidens sit now adays,
In wyndowes and doors, their beauty to praise,
The eyes of such women this is no nay,
Do wound foolyshe men that pass by the way:
Which is the whole cause (as seems to me)
That men report of them worse then they be.
For why the scripture does clearly prefer,
Our gate and behauour to teach what we are.
A tree by his fruit men truly shall know,
And deeds what man is, do perfectly show.
When such perceive men their pride to despise:
They leave their old toys, and new tricks devise.
The fashion is changed, but straight they will
Have other new fangles, worse or as ill:
When I was a bey, I now well remember,
(Though I at that time of age were but tender)
That women their breasts did show and lay out.
And well was yt maid whose dugs then were stout
Which vsance at first came up in the stues.
Which men's wives and daughters after did use.
The preachers at that, then began out to cry,
And honest men did it loathe and defye:
Wherefore they left of that foul sinful guyse,
But straight they laid down their hear to their eyes
So as fast as gods word one sin does blame,
They deuyse other as yil as the same.
And this variety of English solke,
Does cause all wise people us for to mock.
For all discrete nations under the son,
Do use at this day as they first begone:
And never do change, but still do frequent,
Their old guyse, what ever fond folks do invent.
But we here in England like fools and apes,
Do by our vain fangles deserve mocks and iapes,
For all kind of countries do us deryde,
In no constant custom sithe we abide.
For we never know how in our array,
We may in fyrme fashion steadfastly stay.
But now to my purpose, I mind not to put,
In no woman's head to become a slut.
For though God to pride have given his curse,
I (...) slutty shenes to be much worse.
For cleannes is virtue none can denaye,
If pride and excess be banysht away.
But change of proud raiment now daily used,
Ought of all good women to be refused.
This day my cassocke, to morrow my frocke,
Next day my vardy gue nyghest my smock.
This day my kyrtell, with partlet and gown,
To morrow a furred cap just on my crown,
Next day a velvet cap, or a french h^^de.
Who can believe that such women be good?
Some wear a cheyne, and some a black lace,
And colors also to paynt with their face:
Wherewith they do make their faces to shine.
Since god made the world such pride was nere seen
In doing of the which this is no dout,
The Image of God they blot and put out.
Lo thus are they painted out to be sold,
With many mo gaudes then here can be told:
Forgettyng obedience, hatyng Gods law,
And live with their makes, without love or awe.
And many oppressors this day does reygne,
That rob and pyll poor men, wives to maynteyn.
And fearyng least their great pride should be less,
The poor man's cause they will never redress
To maintain their wives that proud are and nyse,
Lewd ^ubbers sometime do rebel and rise.
A lowie with a lord will proudely checkmate,
And is not content with his poor estate.
Against men of honor, the person vile.
Prowdly presumes, woe worth the while,
Boys against elders preferment did take,
And at their own will would magistrates make:
For by their apparel none can now know,
The high estate from the most poor and low.
Each less like a lady is clothed in sylke,
That daily does go to market with milk.
Which never their port could yet maynteyn well.
Unless they were whores, and their husbands steal
Beside the indecent manner to see,
That each one does go in others degree,
Vain women love not the men grave and sage,
But rufflers that rudely ^aue can, and rage:
Whose seruent desire must always provide,
To set forth their wives in pomp and in pride.
For so that such women may have their will,
They pass not although their husbda^es do spyll.
Such weep when their husbands be sick in dead,
And turn it to laughter when they be dead.
Wherefore such proud women are like in hell,
To be rewarded with proud Iesabell:
Unless they repent, and shortly amend:
Which God give them grace yet once to intend,
That I might have cause yet once in my days:
As much for to write to their laud and praise.
For blessed be they that hold them content.
With clean apparel, honest and decent,
And women bearyng of beauty the name,
Without discrete manners ioynde with the same
Solomon does them no better allow,
Then a gold ryng in the nose of a sow.
Therefore let old women honestly live,
And good examples to young women give.
That one by an others conversation,
May learn to leave their abomination,
That virtuous deeds in those of the City,
May be example unto the country.
For they of the country ever take heed,
How they of the city do wear their wede:
Therefore I may say, and so I say will,
The City is first the Author of ill
My prayer therefore shall be day and night,
That each part may mende and walk here aright,
That I may report the maids of my country,
Thanks be to God have learned honestye:
Which God grant me grace, to see in my time,
Thus make I an end, of this simple ryme.
The complaynte of a certain famous town for the death of an honest matron,
wife to one of thinhabitantes of the same, with an answer to the said complayn:
and in fine a general praise of all honest and virtuous women.
Forth as I went my way of late,
(Which was of June the.xvi. day)
After my due and wonted rate,
To set my work in quyete stay:
A sodeyne voice there did me fray,
And much to muse did me constrayne,
So grievously it did complain.
Merueylyng then. I began to say,
What are you that do sygh and groan?
Answer it made without delay:
A famous town does make this mon^,
For such a loss as I have one:
I think there has in no place dwelt,
As Christ's members have well felt.
And why (quod I) what is the case?
What cause have you thus to complain?
With grievous syghes it said alas,
Oh cruel death full of dysdayne:
Why dydst thou not a while refrayn?
But like a scadell vermyne still,
Thou takste the good, and leavst the ill.
What gyrlyshe gylls, what wanton scoldes,
In me does reign, to my great shame:
Whom honest men that them beholdes,
Reports in hurt of my fame:
Such in his rage Death will not tame,
But modest matrons good and true,
In all the haste he does subdue.
For of the best the lest of all,
He has not taken manerly,
But snatched has the principal,
In all my joy most cruelly,
And turned to calamity,
My stay, my health, and my delyght,
Which reigned in that godly wight.
She bare such favor to the truth,
And beneficial to the poor,
Her goodly traynyng up of youth:
As maidens sobre and demure,
And honest wives some be you sure,
To whom she was a godly light,
And to their fete a lantern bright.
Her good constant womanlynes,
Her obedience in her duetye,
Her lemtie and gentylnes
Her hate of vice in like degree
Her better sure I never see,
Her faith was good, her life also:
Her like there are not many ^no.
She loved truth and godlyuesse,
She gave the hungry meat and drink
She lethed vice and wyekednes,
She was without all fault I think,
She help the poor, and did not shrynk,
She clothed the naked and cold,
She help the sick many a fold.
Thus death has taken her away,
That mother was of modestye:
And none can tell the truth to say,
The loss that I sustain thereby.
Therefore I may well weep and cry,
And say Alas woe worth the time,
That brought to me this woeful crime.
Be still thou town thus said I then,
Beware, and hark, what I shall tell:
Thou maynte^nest all wicked men,
Against the good thou doste rebel,
Yea such as preach the Lords gospel.
Therefore no doubt come is the day,
God turns his face from thee away.
Sith thou in time refusedst grace,
Thou shalt be left as one confusde,
Sithe thou doste wyckednes embrace,
And godlynes thou have refusde:
Before the Lord thou art accusde,
And he it is that in his wrath.
Will take away thy friends by death.
Therefore leave of, thus death to blame,
And blame for it thine own offense:
And thyn inhabitants by name,
Be of good there I say to you,
Though I express you not by name:
For known is your indenor true,
To those that will set forth the same,
So that immortal is your fame:
Example as ye have by this
Your sister, that departed is.
Whose worthy praise shall never die,
But like is to indute for ever:
For why she lived worthyly,
And to the end she did perscuer:
God grant us all so to endeavor,
That we may live while we be here,
With God in glory to appear.
^^nen authoris.
If any marvel, that the name
Of town or corpse, I not rehearse:
Hateful envy causde the same,
Naught else kept them out of my verle.
Hate therefore here shall have no cause
At any person to disdeyne:
Let all men flee from enuies claws,
Lest she do them some grefe and pain.

For if as truth is one good thought
Can not in us ouce grow.
Without his grace that always does

How can there any virtuous deed

In us that are but vain and naught
Save for his mercies dear.
Wherefore let none of virtue boste
As of his own pure ways,
But mekly thank Christ for his gifts,
And give him condign praise.
Praise him therefore that first all made
And formed man of slime
And does his work most intri^^te
Preserve from time to time.
Which also when as sinful man
By fault fell into thrall,
Ordained Christ our saving health
By death to heal us all.
Immortal thanks eternal praise
Ever now let us give
Unto this lord of whom we are
And of whose grace we live.
Glory and praise for ever more.
Therefore be to his name,
That virtue made for men to know
And to walk in the same.
